 But when the amount of provisioning for losses is large, for which the bank will be involved in the next two quarters
 anya vikalpon se kitni aay milti he yah dekhnaa baaki he
 In such a situation, it will take at least two quarters for the bank to revert to its old condition
 "the bank's emphasis will be on capitalization from the government, improvement in the core business of the bank and other options

 Indira Gandhi: Indira was not very comfortable after becoming the Prime Minister of the country, the first woman PM of the country with stubborn intentions and fearless decisions
 bhaashan or sansad main bahasabaaji se bachanaa chaahati thim
 She used to speak less
 1969 main unako bajet pesh karnaa tha, tab indira itani dari thim ki unke munh se aawaaj hi nahin nikal rahi thi
 Dr
 KP Mathur, personal physician of Indira Gandhi, has written a lot in his book 'the Unseen Indira Gandhi'
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad ek yaa do saal tak indira bahut tanaav main raheen
 She felt uneasy at the events and tried to avoid them where she had to speak
 is nervasness kii vajah se unka pet gadabad ho jaataa tha yaa unke sir main dard hone lagata tha
 The opposition has always been an attacker on Indira's discomfort
 ram manohar lohia ne to indira ko 'goongi gudiya' tak kah diya tha
 Indira Gandhi was fighting on two fronts, she would have also dealt with the sharp opposition of the opposition, but the rebellion within the party had plagued her
 is bich indira ne kai krantikari faisle bhi liye
 
 
 
 ye the unke krantikari faisle- 19 july 1969 ko indira ne 14 bade bainko kaa rashtrikaran kar diya

 - indira ne bhoomihin or samaaj ke kamjor varg ke liye bhoomi sudhaar niti banaai
 - Indira promoted the Green Revolution
 nateeja ye hua ki pehle jahaan bharat ko america se khadyann aayaat karnaa padataa tha, bharat khadyann niryaat karne laga
 Indira took a different route to see Kitchkitch the day she came to the party
 congress kaa vibhaajan ho gaya

 Prior to Imran's speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also addressed the UN, but he did not name Pakistan and Kashmir even once
 piem ne duniya ke sabase bade manch se shanti, vikaas, jan kalyaan kii baat kahi, lekin imran yahaan bhi kashmir kaa ronaa roe or sanyukt raashtra ko khuli dhamkee de daali
 Imran also reminded what the United Nations was formed in 1945
 imran khan ne kaha ki do parmaanu desh phir se aamane-saamne aaenge or usase pehle sanyukt raashtra ko uske anusaar kaam karnaa hoga or yahi kaaran he ki sanyukt raashtra kaa gathan 1945 main kiya gaya tha
 If a war starts between two countries, we will fight until we achieve independence
 pakistan ke piem ne kaha ki agar do padosi deshon ke bich parmaanu yuddh chhidata he, to iskaa asar duniyabar main hoga
 Imran said - The unjust Pakistani Prime Minister said that injustice is being done to Muslims, due to which they are taking up arms

 unhone kaha ki taliban or alqaida pakistan main nahin hai, balki afghanistan main hai
 Imran Khan said that Tamil Tigers carried out the most suicide attacks, they were Hindus, but do not blame Hindus
 imran khan ne kaha ki aatankwaad kaa kisi dharm se koi naata nahin he
 But when Muslims go to other countries, they are suspected

 Ramantri, a temple mahant in Ayodhya, has been sensationally accused of raping a female devotee
 uttar pradesh police ne mangalvaar ko maamla darj kar mahant ko giraftaar kar liya he
 The woman told the police that Mahanta held her hostage and raped her several times
 police ne medical chekup ke baad mahant ko balaatkaar ke aarope main giraftaar kar liya he
 Ayodhya CO AK Sav said that the 30-year-old woman came to the temple from Varanasi on 24 December
 police adhikari ne kaha ki mandir ke mahant krishnakantacharya ne mahila ko mandir parisar main thaharne kaa kathith rup se prastaav diya, jahaan unhone mahila ko bandhak banaaya or usase kai barbalatkaar kiya
 Police said the woman has been sent to her home after a medical examination

 When he comes to Ayodhya, the Mahant asks him to stay there

 The victim told the police that Mahanta had held her hostage during the incident

 is maamle main mahant ke khilaaf ipisi dhara 376 ke tahat cese darj kar police ne maamle kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 In our country, crores of people take rice and wheat from the public distribution system
 sarkaar vibhinn yojanaon ke tahat unhen sasta anaaj detii he
 Many times we feel that everything must be going well because the government also says all the things in a line that now the machine is getting ration, so the theft has stopped
 jise milanaa chahie use hi mil rahaa he or sarkari khajaane main baari bachat ho rahi he
 This can happen but on the other hand, where people are standing in queues waiting for the ration shop to open, we do not know how this machine is doing with them
 licage to ruk gaya agar rukaa he to, jinhen nahin mila un par kya guzarati hogi
 Many urban viewers of TV may not have gone to the ration shop since time
 main apane aise kai darshakon se miltaa hum jo jate hai
 But they do not have Facebook and Twitter to tweet their condition
 rashan kii mashin se milti julati mashin aapane shaharon kii dukaanon or mal main dekhi hogi, jahaan aap apane debit card or credit cart se paisa dete hai
 By the way, its English name is 'point of sale' machine
 ise pos mashin kehete hai
 The Rajasthan government has named it 'bhamashah ATM' to promote its scheme
 yah mashin pehle aadhaar card ko padhati he, phir anguuthe kaa nishaan dena hota he
 The mark will be found only when the machine matches the Aadhar card's server that the person is real
 ab card sahi nikal gaya to mashin isi aadhaar se jaipur ke ek or sarwar se pataa karegi jahaan rashan card dharakon kii jaankaree he
 When confirmed at both places, the grain will be found
 varna mashin kah degi time out, yani aapako nahin milegaa
 The government claims that this machine is going to revolutionize because the theft from ration shops will stop, the government will save crores of subsidy
 jo hakdaar hoga use hi anaaj milegaa
 Even before the arrival of this machine, Chhattisgarh and many other states claimed to prevent leakage from ration shops
 unki kaaphi saraahna hamane padhi thi
 Now this question will only be explained by the policy controller, when this method could be successful, then why is this method needed? mashin kii laagat, banane vaali company or theke vagairah kaa sawaal to he, magar hamen pataa nahin he uske bare main, isliye koi atakalbaaji nahin
 By the way, Economic Times has a report of 2012 i
e
 four years ago, in which Nandan Nilekani's statement that the average price of each such machine will be Rs 15,000
 hamane sochaa ki kyon na jagah-jagah jaakar dekhen ki garib log, aam log jab is mashin ke paas jate hai to unka anubhav kya hota he
 The ration shop does not open for thirty days
 iske liye rajasthan sarkaar har maheene vitaran saptaah tay karti he
 The distribution week was kept in July from 10 July to 24 July
 lihaaja jab rashan kii dukaan khulti he to bheed kaaphi hoti he
 Now if someone's thumb is not found, no fingerprints are found, then he will not get grain
 nishaan milaane ke baar-baar ke prayaas ke kaaran deree bhi hoti he lihaaja rashan kii dukaan ke baahar kii bheed kaa sabar bhi tuutata hoga
 Since there is no cost of rush and time for the poor and common people, we middle class people will not understand this
 unhen apni takalif jarur dikh jaaegi jab unhen passport offis main ek ghanta line main lagane ke liye kah diya jaae
 Then they will curse India by tweeting and say whether such super power will become their India
 rajasthan se hamaari sahyogi harsha kumari singh or unki team ke sadasyon ne sarkari rashan kii dukaanon par jaakar aam logon ke anubhav ko record kiya
 He has accumulated this experience from four districts so that you will know that no matter how good the government plans, the problems of the common and poor are not solved
 ho saktaa he ki mashin se uske khajaane main bachat ho rahi ho lekin agar kisi ko us maheene kaa anaaj nahin mila to vah kya bachaayegaa
 What is left of him bhukh bachati hogi
 Bhamashah ATM machine does not know anyone
 vah sirf aapke anguuthe ke nishaan se aapako pahachaanati he
 The ration shopkeeper will no longer recognize you because the machine did not recognize your mark
 abhi shaayad sarkaar ne aisi sthiti main kuch riyaayat di he magar jo pareshaani ho rahi he vah bataati he ki agar aadhaar card ko anivaary kar diya gaya to kya hoga
 We only read its merits in the newspapers of Delhi, but do you know that the marks of those who work hard are lost in their hands
 kya aapane kabhi apane ghar aae kisi majdoor kii hatheli uthaakar dekhi he? dekhiegaa
 Will our astrologers also fail the machine? jyotishi log to lalaat padhakar chakma dene lagenge magar mashin ko chhot nahin he ki vah lalaat dekhakar rashan de
 i can show you some fingerprints and fingerprints that Harsha Kumari Singh has sent
 mehanatakash logon ke haathon ke nishaan ghiste-ghiste ghis jate hai
 There is nothing left in the fingers of women in the village countryside
 bartan maanjte-maanjte unki bhagya rekhaaen bhi mit jaati hai
 When the Aadhaar card arrives, all such people may opt out of many schemes
 sarkaar vyavastha kar degi ki nishaan nahin mili to dm, esadm se likhvakar le aaen magar sochie ki kya itane sakasham log hai jo aasaani se pramaan patr le aaenge
 If he goes to the chief then how many games he will play
 iske badale uskaa in logon kii jindagi par kitna niyantran ho jayega
 Harsha says that there is no survey of how many people have lost their fingerprints
 mashin se meraa koi duraagrah nahin he
 Do you know that in the coming times, we will start living on the basis of machine
 meri shikaayat mashin se zyada maanav kii samasya ko lekar he
 When there is no such machine that can cure every human problem, then how can any machine be treated for every problem of ration
 kya aaj kii taarikh main ham is mashin ke liye taiyaar hai yaa isliye baichaiyn hai ki ise lagu kar duniya main naam kamaaya jaae ki hamane kuch kamaal kar diya
 And what about the suffering and pain of common people? yah mashin sim card se chalati he
 In a city like Delhi, there has been an epidemic of call drops for two years
 aae din akhabaaron main nikalataa rahata he
 The condition is that now the telephone company has started advertising in the name of transparency that its app will know where the network is and where it is not
 lekin garib logon ko kahaan se pataa chalegaa
 What is the condition of the village countryside when the network is not well established in Delhi? Like a gentleman could not find a network of machines
 ve mashin haath main liye vaise hi network dhund rahe the jaise 90 ke dashak se pehle ke log chat par chadhakar antena ko kabhi nepal kii taraf modakar to kabhi bhutan kii taraf modakar doordarshan kaa network khojate the
 a shopkeeper of Barmer's ration was looking for a network with his machine
 dhundte-dhundte dukandaar jibahar aa gaye
 They came out and came on the road
 ab ve hawa main network khojate rahe, dukaan ke baahar khadey log vahiin rah gaye
 Shopkeepers kept searching for the network of machines, and since there was no cost to poor people, they kept waiting
 sabase badi baat he ki twit bhi nahin kiya
 The democracy of the country has shifted on social media and it is the people who have been waiting for the grain of democracy in the ration shop till now
 haau sad
 Rajasthan has a population of about seven crore
 isamen se 4 karod 34 lakh log sarkaar kii sasti anaaj yojanaon par nirbhar hai, jo rashan kii dukaanon se chaaval, gehun, chini or mitti kaa tel lete hai
 These people cannot buy wheat at the market rate
 daal nahin milti he isliye ram jane ki yah garib log dedh sau rupee daal kaise khate honge
 Will they eat only bread, or will they be left eating rice and maad
 ham vaaki nahin jaanate hai kyonki inkaa kasoor yah he ki us soshal media main nahin hai, jahaan in dinon demokrasi rahati he
 However, the job of the government is also that the grain should be given to the one who should get it
 isliye vah samay-samay par soochiyon kii safai karti rahati he
 Because crores of rupees are spent on the program of giving food to the poor
 harsha kumari singh ne bataaya ki is vakt bhi soochiyon kii kataai chantai chal rahi he magar 15 lakh nae logon ko bhi joda gaya he, jinhen milanaa chahie tha magar nahin mil rahaa tha
 Not all of those who should get it under the Food Security Act, but it is being claimed that they are getting it
 kisi bhi yojana main chunauti aati he
 This may be the initial challenge, but if the poor who cannot buy more than 2 rupees of grain get delayed by one day, then what about him? Hopefully, this report will help the government to fix its system
 madhya pradesh ke devas jile se ek hairaan kar dene vaala maamla saamne aayaa he
 Here, a young man was tied in chains for only 60 kg of gram
 puraa maamla kuch is tarah he ki 50 saal ke madanlaal gond ne 2 saal pehle buaai ke vakt gaanv main rahane vaale hariprasad ko 60 kilo chanaa diya tha
 In these two years, Hariprasad neither returned the gram nor paid the price
 somvaar ko madan kaa betaa satish, hariprasad ko apane ghar bulaakar le aayaa
 Angry at not returning the money, the father tied Hari's hands and feet to a tree outside his house with chains and rope
 gaanv waalon ne hari kii ye haalat dekhakar madan ko samajhane kii koshish kii, lekin madan or satish ne hari ko nahin choda
 @narendramodi this is the reality of schemes like isopam, seed distribution, these seeds are distributed under the rule of "kisanputra" @chouhanshivraj, "kisanpremari" punished under the rule of @officeofknath, who to blame? @ incindia @ bjp4india @ shailendranrb @ ajaiksaran @ aunindyoc @ ndtvindia # loksabhaelections2019pic

 police ne chandwana pahunchakar hari ko chhudaaya or sabhi ko khategaanv police thane lekar ai
 In the case, the police registered a case and arrested Madan and Satish
 haalanki ye khabar isliye ahm he kyonki garib adivaasiyon ke liye sarkaar kai yojanaayen chalaa rahi he, jisamen krishi vibhaag kii ore se bone ke liye beej dena bhi shaamil he
 In such a situation, a young man was tied like a hungry thirsty animal in 45 degree heat to return the loan of only 60 kg of gram
 is puri ghatana se sarkari yojanaon par kai tarah ke sawaal khadey hote hai
 a case of raping a seven-year-old girl in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh is in front
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yahaan bacchee ke saath uske hostal main rahane vaali room mets ne na keval pitayee kii, balki uske privet part main chadi daal di
 According to news agency ANI, the incident took place on 23 February, but the matter came to light when the girl and her mother lodged a complaint at the Gorella police station on Wednesday (28, February)
 shikaayat main ladki ne police ko bataaya ki, " 23 farvari kii raat hostel main rahane vaali ek ladki nebathroom main kapadebhigo rakhe the
 My clothes fell on another girl's clothes
 isse naaraaz hokar donon ladakiyon ne mujhase jhagada shuru kar diya
 They beat me first and then put a stick in the private part
 "ladki kii maa ne bataaya ki dar ke kaaran bacchee ne yah baat dabaakar rakhi thi
 When i arrived to take her for Holi, she wrapped me and started crying
 maine dekha ki uske sharir par chot ke nishaan the
 When she was asked about it, the girl told the whole incident
 sutron ke mutabik, medical test ke dauraan bacchee ke sharir par chot ke nishaan or privet part main infections mila he
 The doctor has also confirmed the condition of the girl
 philhal bacchee kaa aspataal main ilaaj karaayaa ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, the police have registered a case under sections 377 and 323 of the IPC and the Paxo Act on the complaint of the girl's mother
 is bare main adishnal espi madhulika singh ne kaha ki sarkari hostel main is tarah kii ghatana behad chintajanak he
 From the kind of torture with the girl, it seems that hostel administration has been ignored
 philhal hamane cese darj kar liya he or jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Just a day after the MCD by-election, Kejriwal again raised his full state issue
 bill laae to vivaad hona tay he
 Probably the Chief Minister knows what the future of this bill is going to be, so when the press conference started, there was more discussion of history than the bill, there was an effort to remind the bjp-congress, these two parties fought a lot, now Only efforts are being made to carry forward their struggle
 pichley saal ek janamat sangrah karaane kii sugabugahat uthi thi
 But this time until June 30, two websites from people (www
 fullstatehood

 com) par apni raay dene ko kaha gaya he
 It was also said that the government will meet the Prime Minister, Home Minister to Sonia and Rahul Gandhi on this issue and if necessary a special session of the Assembly can be called
 dilli par kabje ko lekar bayaanbaji charam parasawaal yah he ki bill main darasal he kya or agar he to nayaa kya he? pichley dedh saal se vibhinn muddon par kabhi alji, kabhi dilli police, kabhi emsidi to kabhi centre sarkaar se ulajhane kii kahani to sabane dekhi-suni, raajnneetik bayaanbaji-takaraar ko logon ne janaa, jo nahin dekha yaa suna, vah dard bada he
 The promises made by the Aam Aadmi Party during the 2014 elections included the issue of electricity and water, as well as many things about Delhi's makeovers
 500 nae skool, 20 nae college, 10 hajaar bas, mahila suraksha ke liye kade upaay se lekar civik suvidhaon par kaaphi baaten kahi gai thim, par sankat jameen kaa he, jo didie ke paas he, sankat police se he, jo grih mantralay ke under he or rahaa sawaal emsidi kaa, us par kabje kii ek koshish shila sarkaar ne bhi kii thi, tab bhi safalataa nahin mili thi or baat emsidi ke teen bhaag main bantwaare par aakar tik gai thi
 What happened in Delhi after two big conflicts with MCD over salary in the last one year, everyone saw it and paid
 agar sarkaar ke is bill ke praavdhaanon par jaaen to kejariwal sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki lutian dilli yani nai dilli nagarpalika parishad or dilli kaint ke alaava baaki dilli par dilli sarkaar kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 Since the Lutyens zone has embassies, parliament, mps' residences, president-prime Minister's residence and VIP quarters and Delhi Cantonment has a large army area, Kejriwal feels that the Center can keep the responsibility of security and administrative arrangements there
 iske alaava baaki dilli yani police, jameen or prashasan par adhikaar yaa dakhal dilli sarkaar kaa hi rahe
 What is there in the draft bill + The proposed bill talks about changes in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act 1957
 + section 2 ke cloj (10) ke tahatadilli kaa matlab puri dilli, nai dilli or dilli cantoment ko rakhaa gaya he
 + 'state of Delhi' has been renamed instead of 'national Capital Territory of Delhi'
 + sarkaar kaa matlab dilli sarkaar hoga
 Amendment has also been proposed in the Delhi Development Act 1957
 + iske alaava dilli police act 1978 main sanshodhan kaa prastaav he
 + The most important amendment in Delhi is in the context of 'administrator i
e
 Lieutenant Governor', whose name has been amended and named as 'governor' only
 + isaki vyakhya karte hue kaha gaya he ki rajyapal samvidhan ke anuchhed 163 ke tahat mantrimandal kii salaah or sahyog ke tahat kaam karenge
 + So far, LG has been granted administrative powers under 239 (a), it is proposed to be cut
 + prastaav main dilli rajya ke liye alag prashasnic cader banane kii baat kahi gai he
 There is also a proposal to change the name of High Court of National Capital Territory to High Court of Delhi
 aakhir kyon chahie didie, police or emsidicageriwal sarkaar ko apane kai project ko puraa karne ke liye jameen chahie
 But the land is with the DDA and he has to pay for taking the land from the DDA
 kejariwal kai baar is dard kaa bayaan kar chuke hai ki kaise ek bas depo ke liye jameen hasil karne ke liye didie dilli sarkaar se karodo rupee maangati he
 The MCD also demanded the DDA whenever there was a conflict between salary and money and the MCD demanded implementation of the recommendations of the Fourth Finance Commission
 haalanki sach yah bhi he didie ke paas kaaphi jameen nahin bachi he
 More or less the same situation is with the Delhi Police
 nirbhaya cond ke baad shila dikshit se istipha maangane or unki bechaargi par sawaal khadaa karne vaale kejariwal pichley dedh saal main mahila suraksha ko lekar kuch khaas nahin kar paae
 Kejriwal had been accused of vandalism, Kejriwal had talked about an app for women safety, 1
5 million cctvs were to be installed, women commando wing had to be built, buses had to be marshalled for security, but nothing special happened and opposition continued to raise questions Used to be
 dilli sarkaar ne minakshi hatyakand ko lekar jo bavaal to khadaa kiya lekin khud sawaalon main ghir gaye ki aakhir shila tip bechaargi jataane kaa kya matabal
 Since the MCG is responsible for education and sanitation besides basic civic work and there is a cry of funds, Kejriwal wants the three municipal corporations to have their underage since coming into government
 kooda andolan ke dauraan sarkaar ne teenon nagar nigamon ke fund ke audit kii baat kii thi, par kuch khaas nahin hua
 Now the government believes that development and security of the remaining two crore people cannot be put at stake only because of the presence of the central government and diplomat
 bijepi-congress ne khadey kiye sawaljis press conferes main kejariwal bijepi aurcongresske purv prayaason kii charchaa kar rahe the, vakt nahin beetaa ki in dalon ne kejariwal kii niyat par sawaal khadaa karnaa shuru kar diya
 First of all, he clarified from BJP that the party has made its stand clear in 2014 on the demand for its full state and now the party is not in favor of a full state
 party kaa tark yah he ki beuroperesi or dilli police ko lekar jis tarah se kejariwal or unke netaa apmanjanak bhashaa kaa prayog kar rahe hai or jis tareeke se adhikariyon ko handle karnaa chaahate hai, use dekhte hue kejariwal ke prashasnic kshamta par sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, there is no point in giving full authority to the Kejriwal government
 bijepi kaa tarkparty adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay kaa tark he ki kya kejariwal sarkaar police main bantwaare kii baat kar rahe hai, ek nai dilli ke liye jo centre ko report kare or duusari baaki dilli ke liye, jo kejariwal ko report kare
 Also, what will happen to the mlas elected from New Delhi and Delhi Cantt, who will they tell their trouble and the complaint will remain
 udhaaharan ke taur par kejariwal khud nai dilli se vidhayak hai, or vahaan police centre ko report karen, yah mukhyamantri kaa sweekaar hoga
 Will the conflict reduce or increase complications due to this measure
 vahiin purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit kaa maananaa he ki essidi ke upachunaav ke baad is tarah kaa prastaav laane se shaq paidaa hota he
 People feel that nothing has happened in Delhi and people are comparing in Congress and Kejriwal government and the result is in the same direction
 jo vibhaag yaa maamle kejariwal sarkaar ke andar aate hai, usee daayre main bhi pehle bhi bahut kuch kiya gaya, ab bhi kiya ja saktaa he, par kaam kii bajaay baaki sab kuch ho rahaa he
 Now what next? After the opinion of the people, the government can pass the resolution demanding full statehood in the assembly and will send it to the center so that it can be implemented through constitutional amendment
 lekin hakeekat main aisa sambhav he yaa nahin
 In fact, in 1993, the first BJP government passed the full state resolution in the Delhi Assembly, then the Chief Minister was Madan Lal Khurana
 11 sitambar, 2002 main shila dikshit shasankaal main ek baar phir sarvasammati se purna rajya kaa prastaav paarit hua, tab centre main bhi endie sarkaar thi
 At the Center, LK Advani introduced the amendment bill in the Rajya Sabha, which was sent to the Parliament Committee, but nothing further came to light
 congress ne bhi purna rajya kii maang uthaai thi26 november, 2010 ko ek baar phir dilli vidhansabha ne purna rajya kaa darja kaa prastaav paarit kiya, jab centre main congress kii sarkaar thi
 So the resolution should be passed and implemented, it is not possible in the current system, it is certain
 isi dilli sarkaar ne lokapal bill pesh kiya, paarit kiya, centre ko bheja, ab us bill kaa kya hua, isaki sud lene ko dilli sarkaar bhi taiyaar nahin he
 For the last six months, there are about a dozen bills which the Delhi Assembly has passed, but so far cases are pending
 yahaan tak ki vidhayakon kii selary kaa bill bhi centre ke paas lambit he
 Air Force Chief PV Naik said on Tuesday that US military help to Pakistan is a matter of concern for India and this has been conveyed to the Obama administration
 nike ne chif of staff cameti ke chairman kii jimmedaari sanbhaalane ke baad kaha, ‘pakistan ko di jane vaali madad nishchit taur par hamaare liye chintaa kaa kaaran he tathaa hamane is bare main avgat karaayaa he

 India has asked the US to ensure that the weapons supplied to Pakistan are used against the Taliban and fundamentalist elements and that they should not be used against India
 yah puche jane ki kya sainya sahaayta mudde kaa bhartiya vaayu sena ko 126 ladaaku vimaan kii aapurti kii daud main shaamil america companiyon kii sambhaavnaaon par koi asar pad saktaa he, nike ne kaha, ‘jahaan tak 126 bahu uddeshy ladaaku vimaanon ke saude kii baat he, yah ek nishpaksh akalan hoga
 At the moment there is no connection between these two
 ’ unhone kaha ki bhartiya vaayu sena apane vimaanon kii peshkash karne vaali chah companiyon kaa pareekshan karegi tathaa uske baad is par antim faisla kiya jayega
 On reports of the Indian Air Force developing airstrips in the eastern sector to deal with the Chinese threat, Naik said that the upgradation of the infrastructure in the area had been pending for a long time but was not being done keeping in mind any country
 unhone kaha ki hawaii pattiyon kaa unnayan kiya ja rahaa he taaki vahaan bhartiya vayusena bede ke aadhunik vimaanon kaa parichaalan kiya ja sake
 Asked if the recent Agni, Prithvi and Dhanush ballistic missiles were tested for the purpose of conveying messages, the Air Force chief said, "whenever we have to deliver a message, we give it clearly
" jab bhi dene yogya koi sandesh hoga, ham aapako jaankaree denge
 ' uttar pradesh chunaav main samaajawaadee party or congress kaa prachaar-prasar karne utre rashtriya janata dal supremeo lalu prasad yadav kaa kahana he ki vah ek freelansar rajaneta hai
 a freelancer journalist who does not work for only one institution, Lalu believes that he is a freelancer politician who can go to any state to completely crush organizations like BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 buudhvaar ko uttar pradesh ke bulandshahr main apane damaad rahul yadav jo ki samaajawaadee party ke tikat par sikanderabad se chunaav lard rahe hai ke liye prachaar-prasar karne ke baad kaha ki vah bhaajapa or sangh ke nafrat or jehar ko puri tareeke se khatm karne ke liye uttar pradesh aae hai
 Lalu said that the way in which he and Nitish Kumar stopped the bjp's Vijay Rath in the Bihar elections, similarly in Uttar Pradesh, they will stop the BJP

 BSP supremo Mayawati on Sunday held the UP elections in Agra
 bade shaharon main agra surakshit seat he, isiilie maaya ne shuruuaati raily agra se kii
 After the posters banners were poured to Agra, to show strength, Maya chose the grounds of the Kothi Meena Bazaar in Agra
 kehete hai ki ye maidan itnaa bada he ki jaldi koi party yahaan raily karne kii himmat nahin jutati
 Modi had a rally here in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 bheed jute gai, aakhir agra or aligarh mandal ke 16 vidhansabha siton ke basapa ummidavaaron kii apni bahanji ke saamne pariksha jo thi
 Maya came at 1 pm, made it clear in her speech that at one o'clock, Mayawati's helicopter landed on the ground, she got down from the helicopter and reached the stage by car
 phir shuru huabhaashan kaa daur
 Mayawati's one-hour-20-minute speech targeted BJP and RSS the most
 modi sarkaar ko dhanna sethon ke haq main kaam karne vaali bataakar jamkar majammat kii, jhuthe vaade karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 So, while attacking the Sangh chief directly, he said that these people are asking Hindus to have more children, while people are still sleeping hungry
 sangh pehle modi sarkaar kahe ki wo garibi, berogari or bhukhmaree khatm karne ke liye kuch kyon nahin karte
 Mayna blamed the Dalits for the incidents against Dalits across the country, including Una
 bijepi kaa saath dene vaale buddha bhikshuon par bhi maaya ne tikhaa hamalaa kiya or kaha ki kuch swaarthee or aresas ke log bal mundwakar bargalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 It was clear that Mayawati remembers the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when she did not have a seat in UP
 dar bijepi ke hindu card kaa bhi he ki kahin dalit bijepi ke hindu card main basapa se tut na jaae
 sp's development hurt, Congress's condition, Mayawati hurt Kastaspa government's law and order as usual, but tried to air the Akhilesh government's development claims by saying that all the big projects started at the time of BSP government It only happened
 vahincongressor bijepi ke netaaon ke dalit bhoj par tanj kasate hue mayawati ne congress ko khastahal bataakar use to ladaai main hi nahin mana
 Said - Tilak, scales and slogan slogan Baiyamawati did not amend the upper castes after the Dalit vote bank
 maaya boleen savarna bhram main na aaen
 The BSP never endorses slogans like tilak, scales and swords
 basapa main unako bhi bade ohade milte hai, wo sarkaar main mantri bhi banate hai
 Then gave the slogan - Sarvjan Hitay, Sarvjan Sukhay
 musalamaanon ko bhi lubhaane kii koshishmayawati ne bijepi ek dharm ke logon ko duusare dharm ke logon se ladaakar upi main satta paanaa chaahati he, jabaki wo satta main ain to jangalraj nahin kanoon kaa raaj hoga
 Those who work against any particular religion will not be spared
 satta main aane par aise logon ke khilaaf sakht ection hoga
 The Mayawatibaspa supremo, who also lashed out at the media, realized that recently the negative message of leaving many leaders, including Swami Prasad Maurya, has gone public
 isliye pehle to jane ke baad aarope lagane vaale netaaon ko kosa, phir jis party main gaye un par hamalavar huin, uske baad media ke ek varg ko nishane par lete hue kaha ki media main ek manuaadi or dhannasethon kaa tabaka he jo basapa ke khilaaf khabar ko lambey vakt tak khinchataa he, jabaki saamaanya media aisi kisi khabar ko ek yaa do din hi dikhataa he
 Maya's eye on upper caste votes with dalit-muslim alliances made it clear that, in terms of political equations, she wants to form dalit-muslim alliances and then hopes that a section of upper castes will join her if a strong base is formed
 Will come and she will again take over the chair of CM of UP
 lekin maaya ko khyaal rakhana hoga ki loksabhaa kii tarj par dalit khiske nahin to vahin bade paimaane par muslim samudaay ke us sawaal kaa jawaab talashna hoga ki aakhir teen baar wo pehle bijepi ke saath milakar sarkaar bana chuki hai, aage aisa nahin karengi isaki kya guarantee he
 But Mayawati did not answer this at the rally in Agra
 aakhir main bheed dekhakar khush mayawati ne jane se pehle apane helicopter se maidan ke do chakkar lagaae
 Shook hands and greeted the people and returned to cherish the dream of becoming Chief Minister again

 The curtain has fallen on the political drama that began after two independents withdrew support to the congress-jds coalition government in Karnataka
 purv mukhyamantri bies yediurppa do nirdaleey vidhayakon kaa to jugad kar liya, lekin congress vidhayakon ko istipha dene ke liye raji nahin kar paae
 Despite all their efforts, Operation Lotus 3 failed
 karnataka ke is raajnneetik drama ko oparation lotus 3 isliye kaha ja rahaa he kyonki yediurppa isse pehle sarkaar banane kii koshish do baar or kar chuke hai
 a whip has been issued to all legislators by Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah for the Legislature Party meeting convened by Yeddycongress on Friday, which failed to get the resignation of Congress mlas, which mlas not included may be disqualified
 
 vip jari hone ke baad congress ke naaraaz vidhayakon ke saamne do vikalp bache yaa to party ke saath khadey hon yaa ayogy ghoshit hokar istipha den or dobaaraa 'camel' ke simbel par chunaav lard vidhansabha main aaen
 But the number of these Congress mlas was not enough that Yeddyurappa would have formed the government
 isliye in vidhayakon ke congress kheme main waapas lautnaa munasib samajha
 The HD Kumaraswamy government of Karnataka had complete figures despite withdrawal of support from two independent mlas
 224 sadasyeey vidhansabha main gathbandhan ke paas vidhayakon kii sankhya 118 thi or sarkaar par vastav main koi khatra nahin tha
 But the atmosphere became as if the government was about to fall
 is bich halchal or bad gai jab purv mukhyamantri bies yediurppa 104 bijepi vidhayakon ke saath gurugram ke resort pahunch gaye or congress ke 4 vidhayak achaanak party ke sampark se baahar ho gaye
 The high command kept a silent silence
 Yeddyurappa also asked for a time to meet BJP President Amit Shah during this period
 lekin party ne intjaar karo or dekho kii ranneeti apanaai kyonki isse thik 7 maheene pehle bijepi ne karnataka main sarkaar banane kii naakaam koshish kii thi jisamen uski khub kirakiri hui thi
 Obviously, the central leadership of the party will not want to take any risk regarding its image before the Lok Sabha elections
 yediurppa kaa khud ko praasangik rakhane kaa prayasvishleshkon kii maane to sarkaar banane kaa yah prayaas 75 varshiya purv mukhyamantri bies yedirappa kaa ek tarafa prayaas tha
 Because he knows that if he does not become the chief minister now, he will be 80 years old in 2023 and then he will be disqualified for this post according to the tradition of BJP
 pichley kuch samay se yediurppa kaa record jeet kaa kam or haar kaa zyada rahaa he, jisamen sabase badi party hone ke baavjood sarkaar na bana paanaa, pichley oktober main hue upachunaav main paanch siton main se chaar siton par haar or sarkaar banane kii 2 naakaam koshishen pramukh hai
 This was the third failed attempt by Yeddyurappa to form a government in the last 6 months
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kii maane to yediurppa kii is koshish ke peeche unka yah dar tha ki yadi ve is baar mukhyamantri nahin bane to dobaaraa nahin ban paaenge
 Because till the completion of the five-year term of congress-jds, BJP wants to stand second-line leadership in the state
 lihaaja, yadi ve kaamyaab ho jate to agle kuch saalon tak khud ko raajnneetik taur par praasangik rakh paaenge
 The BJP needs Yeddyurappa in the Lok Sabha elections
 After this failure of Yeddyurappa, the road ahead for them is closed, it is not so, at least till the Lok Sabha elections
 pichley kai saalon se bijepi kii karnataka ikai main nayaa netritv khadaa karne kii charchaa chal rahi he
 But till now, no other leader like Yeddyurappa could stand
 lihaaja bhale hi ve sarkaar banane ke apane prayaas main asafal rahe lekin rajya main party kaa ekmaatr cheharaa bhi vahi hai
 Karnataka has 28 Lok Sabha seats
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne 20 par jeet kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 The Congress and JDS alliance is said to be contesting elections together
 aise main lingayat samudaay ke sabase prabhavi netaa yediurappa kii jarurat party ko loksabhaa chunaav main padegi

 After the results on May 23, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has given the task of creating a strategy for the Congress in the current politics of the country to Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot

 It is believed that Ashok Gehlot has been given this responsibility at the national level to keep an eye on the political situations that are created after the election results

 Whether it is Chandrababu Naidu or Mamta Banerjee or Kumaraswamy
 ashok gahalot sabhi ko saath lekar chalane main yakeen rakhte hai

 Narendra Modi's dominance is more due to fear in BJP than congress-upa and NDA
 party ke ek dhade ko modi kaa naam manjuur nahin he
 Under the pressure of the party and the Sangh, there is silence now, but the explosion can happen anytime
 bijepi ke goa manthan se narendra modi ke rup main party ke liye ek aisa amrit niklaa, jisane lakhon kaaryakartaaon main adbhut josh bhar diya
 Party President Rajnath Singh himself considered Modi as the greatest leader in the huge gathering of party workers
 lekin jis amrit ko pine ke liye party adhyaksh samet lakhon kaaryakarta betaab ho gaye, vahi amrit kai bade netaaon ke liye jehar ban gaya
 Modi said 'bhasmasur' a big leader of Congress, but many leaders in BJP have realized this
 jis modi ko gujarat se nirvasit kar diya gaya tha, use gujarat kii bagdor mili to adwani kii badaulat
 The Modi who was in the mood to remove the Gujarat riots in the shadow of the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Advani was saved despite the opposition of many
 tab adwani ne vaajapeyi se kaha tha- modi ko hataayenge to bavaal much jayega
 Now that Modi became the party's biggest maharathi for 2014, Advani began to create ruckus and Modi supporters in Modi's name
 adwani to bijepi ke sabase bade netaa maane jate hai
 Therefore, he expressed his opposition by throwing a dice of resignation, otherwise there is no shortage of leaders in BJP who are scared of Modi's growing stature and position
 adwani kii badshahath kii vakaalat karne vaali sushamaa swaraj hon, yaa jaswant singh yaa yashavanth sinha, in sabhi netaaon ke liye modi ko sweekaar karnaa bahut mushkil ho rahaa he
 In the name of Modi, BJP has started its Ashwamedha Yagna to win 2014
 bijepi kaa ghoda nikal padaa he
 But with that horse in the hands of Modi, the BJP is not only creating fear among many leaders of being empty handed, but can also be a cause of great furore in the party
 dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal kareeb ek saal kii khamoshi ke baad phir apane tevar dikhaane lage hai
 Kejriwal has again started showing aggressive attitude towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP

 From April 2017 to May 2018 Arvind Kejriwal refrained from attacking directly against Prime Minister Modi
 beete ek hafte se arvind kejariwal ek baar phir apane usee chirparichit andaaj main lautate dikhaai de rahe hai
 Kejriwal is accusing his government of harassing his government in Delhi and not letting him work
 saath hi ve centre kii aarthik nitiyon se desh kii janata ko hone vaali dikkaton kaa bhi jamkar hawala de rahe hai
 What is the reason for Kejriwal's return to the old posture? What is the reason for Kejriwal's sudden return to the old posture? Has the possibility of opposition solidarity and grand alliance across the country compelled Kejriwal to do so
 bijepi ke khilaaf kai rajyon main sthaneey kshatrapon ke haath milaane kii kavayad shuru ho gai he
 However, the Aam Aadmi Party has not made it clear whether it will be a part of the Grand Alliance or not
 lekin ye tay he ki pashchim bengal main mamata banerjee hon yaa andhra main chandrababu naidu, vampanthi netaa seetaram yechuri hon yaa tamilnadu main abhinayta camel hasan, in dinon kejariwal har ek ke saath manch saajha karte najar aa rahe hai
 With the prospect of the formation of a grand alliance in 2019, leaders of regional parties have started attacking Prime Minister Modi, the central government and the BJP
 is kaam main kabhi bad chadhakar aage rahane vaale kejariwal bhi phir kahaan mauka chookte
 Kejriwal wrote on Twitter, 'my sources have said that the Prime Minister wants to put all possible pressure on the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi to stop the work done by the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi in the fields of education, health, water and electricity
 ham aisa nahin hone denge
 Good work will continue
 bhagwaan hamaare saath he or log hamaare saath hai
 'kejriwal also wrote that,' i have come to know that the Prime Minister is extremely angry with the current Lieutenant Governor of Delhi
 pradhanmantri ko lagata he ki uparajyapal anil baijal dilli sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main adnga nahin laga paa rahe hai
 Despite all the efforts of the Lieutenant Governor, the Delhi Government is doing a great job for the people and this is why the former Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung was removed
 'I am told PM is very angry wid present LG
 PM thinks Mr Baijal not creating sufficient obstacles
 Becoz despite all obstacles by LG, Del govt doing phenomenal work for people

 Kejriwal's attempt is to create a BJP versus Aam Aadmi Party contest, especially in Delhi
 jaahir he aisi sthiti main congress ke saath dilli main uskaa gathbandhan banataa he to kejariwal kii koshish yahi rahegi ki aam aadmi party kaa haath congress se upar rahe
 Describing the Parmodi government as a complete failure on the economic front, Kejriwal posted on social media on June 3, 'the Modi government has ruined the entire nation's economy

 'dekha jaae to kamobesh har din kejariwal ne modi sarkaar, piem modi or bijepi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Sources in the Aam Aadmi Party did not say anything directly to this new bet of Kejriwal but hinted, 'it may be a wrong policy to make a statement against a person when he is very famous, but when a person starts falling below his fame Criticizing it is the right strategy
 'aam aadmi party ko lagata he ki desh main kai morchon par naakaamiyon ke chalate modi sarkaar kaa graph neeche gir rahaa he or yahi sahi mauka he us par akraman tej karne kaa, yahi vajah he ki kejariwal ne apni puraani pahchaan ke mutabik pradhanmantri modi se har morche par do-do haath karne kii thaan lee he

 hindustan kaa most wonted aatanki masood azhar ek baar phir batch gaya
 Survived because the Chinese wall was standing in front of him
 pichley 10 saalon main ye chauthi baar he jab china ne jaish ke sargana masood azhar ko antarrashtriya aatanki banane se bachaa liya
 The question is why China is saving a terrorist again and again
 masood azhar se aakhir uskaa aisa kya lagaav he? to iskaa jawaab he paisa or power
 China has invested trillions of rupees in Pakistan
 isaliye pakistan ko naaraaz nahin kar saktaa or bharat main shanti ho ye china ke hit main nahin he
 So he wants to keep India just entangled through Pakistan
 bharat main ek badi puraani kahawat he
 Give a hand ek haath le
 But this saying begins to change as it reaches Pakistan via China
 pakistan ke saath china is kahawat ko thodaa badalakar istemaal karata he
 That is, give one hand and take many hands
 hindustani kahawat ke is chini style ko thodaa aasaan lafzon main samajhie
 This means that in the case of terror, China will save the world from being insulted by Pakistan
 magar pakistan ko uske is ehsaan kaa badla chukaana hoga
 And this change will be in a little Chinese style
 chini style kaa badla hota kya he ye ham aapako ek ek karke samajhaayenge
 But first, know how China put the shame of Pakistan in front of the international fraternity
 china ne phir kii aatanki masood azhar kii madad
 There was an obstacle in the UN being declared a global terrorist
 masood ajahar par 10 saal main china ne chauthi baar ye chaal chali he
 And vetoed Masood Azhar to save him
 pichley 18 saalon se
 
 yani 2001 ke sansad hamalon se 2019 ke pulavama hamale tak
 This dreaded terrorist of Pakistan has given many wounds to India one after the other
 duniya ke tamaam deshon ne mana kii jaish kaa ye sargana puri insaaniyat ke liye khatra he
 So it should be declared a global terrorist so that terror can be tackled
 magar pichley 10 saalon se china aatank ke is sargana kii dhaal bana baitha he
 And whenever India tried to put it in the Global Terrorist List
 tab-tab china ne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main adnga daal diya
 However, after the Pulwama attack, this time on February 27, this proposal was brought to France, Britain and America
 10 se zyaada deshon ne prastaav kaa samarthan kiya
 It was decided that if no member of the Security Council objected to this
 jaish ke sargana masood azhar ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kar diya jayega
 In this sense, the proposal deadline was ending on Wednesday, March 13 at 12:30 pm
 laga is baar to masood ko uske kiye kii sazaa mil hi jaaegi
 But just one hour before the offer deadline
 china ne is par adnga laga diya
 China said that it has said earlier that the action without evidence is wrong
 jis par america ne china se guzarish kii thi ki wo samajhadaari se kaam len
 For peace in indo-pak it is necessary to declare Masood as a global terrorist
 china ke adnge ke baad masood azhar ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kiye jane kii ek or koshish naakaam ho gai
 However, following the proposal, members of the Security Council have clearly warned China that if it does not change its stand on Masood Azhar, other options of action are also open
 kul milakar pichley 10 saalon main china masood ajahar ko bachaane ke liye chaar baar chaal chal chukaa he
 In 2009 India itself came up with this proposal
 vahiin 2016 main bharat ne pi-3 yani america, france or britain ne milakar prastaav pesh kiya tha
 In 2017, only 3 countries had proposed this proposal
 or is baar bhi pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad ye prastaav france, britain or america lekar aayaa
 However, this time China has not used veto power to topple this proposal, but according to sources, China has put the proposal on 'technical hold'
 technical hold kaa matlab he ki use prastaav par vichaar karne ke liye kuch or vakt chahie
 It is not so that the sword of Masood Azhar being declared an international terrorist hangs on his head
 magar china kaa itihaas dekhte hue lagata he ki wo bharat ko kamazor karne ke liye pakistan kaa saath de saktaa he
 The question is why China is saving a terrorist again and again
 
 What is his attachment to Masood Azhar? So the answer is money and power
 china ne pakistan main kharbon rupye nivesh kar rakhe hai
 Therefore, Pakistan cannot be angry and peace in India is not in China's interest
 lihaaza wo pakistan ke zarie bharat ko bas uljhaae rakhana chahta he

 An order of Bihar's special branch is in the news these days
 darasal, special branch kii intelligence wing ne rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) or uske anushangik sanghathanon ke rajya padaadhikariyon ke bare main jaankaree ikattha karne kaa aadesh diya he
 This order has been issued to all the deputy sps of the Special Branch in May, asking them to collect the name and address of the office bearers of the organizations
 special branch kii ore se jari aadesh main rashtriya swayan sevak sangh, vishwa hindu parishad, bajrang dal, hindu jaagran samiti, dharm jaagran samnayav samiti, muslim rashtriya manch, hindu raashtra sena, rashtriya sevika samiti, shiksha bharti, durga vahini, swedashi jaagran manch, bhartiya kisaan sangh, bhartiya majdoor sangh, bhartiya railway sangh, akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad, akhil bhartiya shikshak mahasang, hindu mahasabha, hindu yuva vahini, hindu putr sanghathan ke padaadhikariyon kaa naam or pataa maanga gaya he
 Special branch order: This order of special branch was issued on May 28 this year
 is aadesh kii copy saamne aane ke baad bihar police ke aalaa adhikari kuch bhi bolne se batch rahe hai
 On condition of anonymity, a police officer said that this is a routine practice
 krime branch kii team niyamit antaraal par aisi jaankaree ikattha karti rahati he
 On this order of the Bihar government, former Union Minister and BJP leader Sanjay Paswan said that the order given by the Bihar Police Government to collect information about the people of the Sangh is a very serious issue
 is par bijepi or sangh donon gambhirtha se le rahi he
 The agitation against the reservation is remembered even today among the upper-caste movements in India
 aisa bhi kaha jaataa he ki is andolan ne unako unki shakti kaa ehsaas bhi karaayaa
 When VP Singh implemented the Mandal Commission's recommendations, many youths gave up their lives against it
 andolankariyon kaa tark hota tha ki naukariyaan merit ke aadhaar par milani chahie
 Where will the doctor or engineer selected under reservation stand in front of a merit person? Reservation of any kind is an injustice to those with merit
 doosraa tark hota tha ki aarakshan kaa aadhaar aarthik hona chahie
 After this, reservation was also demanded for the poor upper castes
 saamaanya varg ke liye aarakshan bill sambandhi samvidhan sanshodhan loksabhaa main paas ho gaya he
 Now the question arises whether the opposition to reservation of upper castes will calm down? Will it not arise now that reservation of any kind is an agreement with merit
 kya is 10 fisadi aarakshan kaa laabh lene vaale log bina aarakshan ke safalataa paane waalon se kam yogya nahin honge? kota ko bheekh kehane vaale log kya ab bhi apni baton par kaayam rahenge? kya ab har tarah kaa aarakshan khatm karne kii baat nahin hogi? kya modi sarkaar saamaanya varg ke logon ko aarakshan kaa vastav main laabh dena chaahati he yaa yah ek jhunjhuna he
 According to the Savarna reservation bill, 10 percent reservation for the general class will not be from the reservation for Scheduled Castes, Tribes and Other Backward Classes (OBC)
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne loksabhaa main ise saaf karte hue bataaya ki saamaanya varg ko 10 fisadi aarakshan se supreme court dwaara nirdhaarit aarakshan kii 50 fisadi seemaa kaa ulanghan nahin hoga
 Jaitley said that the Supreme Court has set 50 per cent limit for socially and economically backward only
 iske peeche tark tha ki saamaanya varg ke liye kam se kam 50 fisadi siten to chodi jaaen varanaa ek varg ko ubaarane ke liye duusare varg ke saath bhedbhaav ho jaataa
 In this sense, the current bill is not against the spirit behind the decision of the Supreme Court
 yani yah jo rigerveshan diya jayega, usee 50 fisadi main se diya jayega jisamen saamaanya varg ke sadsy fite karte rahe hai yaa jo sabhi ke liye khulaa hota he
 Where are those who speak against reservation? So has the Modi government made those speaking out against reservation disgusted by this master stroke? a large section of the upper castes has been speaking out against the reservation
 mandal ayog kii siforeeshon ko jab purv pradhanmantri veepi singh ne lagu kiya to deshbhar main pradarshnon kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 Suicide incidents were reported
 baad ke dinon main youth for ikvality jaisaa sanghathan khadaa ho gaya
 This organization has always opposed caste-based reservation, whether it is a Mandal commission or reservation in promotion
 samarthan lekin 50 fisadi main shaamil ho yah aarakshadab youth for ikvality modi sarkaar ke is 10 fisadi aarakshan ke bill kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 Secretary for Youth for Equality Dr
 arun kumaar ne 'ajtak' ke ek kaarykram main ise aitihaasik or saahasik kadam bataaya
 He said that till now there was no talk of reservation on economic grounds
 samvidhan main bhi saamaajik or aarthik pichhadaa varg likhaa hua he
 There is no mention of caste anywhere
 lekin abhi tak jaateey str par aarakshan jari he
 The reservation was said to be reviewed at 10 years, but it did not happen
 agar 70 saal baad aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan dene kii vakaalat kii ja rahi he to yah saraahneey kadam he
 However, he says that if reservation goes through the unreserved portion, Youth for Equality will oppose it
 youth for ikvality ke president dow
 Kaushal Kant Mishra also did aajtak
 in se kaha ki yadi yah maamla supreme court main jaataa he to court ise scrootni ke liye bhejega
 During that time, his organization will demand to incorporate this upper caste reservation in the reservation prescribed for the Other Backward Classes and will petition for it
 aresas ke sur bhi badlerashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko aarakshan virdohi mana jaataa he
 During the Bihar assembly elections, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat had said to review the reservation
 lekin sangh vichaarak sangeet raagi ne 'ajtak' se baat karte hue saamaanya varg ke liye aarakshan die jane kaa samarthan kiya
 He curses the Congress for not giving reservations to poor upper castes in the last 70 years
 vah kehete hai ki alabatta 1991 main pi
 V
 narsimha raav sarkaar ne saamaanya varg ke garibon ko aarakshan dene kii kavayad kii, lekin vah pahal thos rup nahin le pai
 Sangeet Ragi says that there is no single caste in the Other Backward Classes, nor is there a particular caste in the Scheduled Castes
 isi tarah saamaanya varg bhi homozenise nahin he
 There are many such upper castes in the general category who are much poorer than even the most Dalits
 unki chintaa koun karegaa? kya unka sirf yahi dand he ki wo is desh main apper cast main paidaa hue hai, unki pidiyon ne aisa kiya hoga jiskaa dand unhen bhugatna pad rahaa he
 He considers 10% reservation as an exercise to bring the poor into the mainstream
 60 fisadi aarakshan ke baad kya merit ko or nuksaan hoga?modi sarkaar ke is kadam ko saraahneey bataane vaala youth for ikvality bhi ab merit kii baat nahin kar rahaa he
 The class which calls reservation of Scheduled Castes, Tribes and Other Backward Classes as Baisakhi is also ready to ride the same Baisakhi
 lekin sawaal to mauju he ki ab kya merit kaa dayera simat jayega? kya merit kii ladaai 60 fisadi banaam 40 fisadi hogi? is sawaal ko bhi darkinar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki agar nayaa bill kanoon ban jaataa he to kya vastav main saamaanya varg ke saath insaaf hoga yaa yah sirf jhunjhuna banakar rah jayega? kyonki arun jetali ke mutabik yah 10 pratishat kaa kota bhi saamaanya varg ke hisse se hi janaa he
 a look at the decision of the Supreme Court- kya aap soch sakate hai ki desh kii sabase sammanit upiessi pariksha paas karne ke baad bhi kisi ko dar dar bhatakana pad saktaa he
 Even after passing the IAS examination, a person was not reinstated simply because there was no vacancy for the blind but the court has now given justice to that person
 sangharsh kii ye kahani he ek aise shaks kii, jisaki ankhon kii roshni khoi to hausala doguna ho gaya
 Due to this encouragement, that person named Ravi Prasad Gupta passed the examination of IAS, but Ravi is getting the job on the orders of Delhi High Court
 hoicourt ne upiessi ko nirdesh diya he ki ravi ko chah hafton ke bheetar iees ke taur par bhartee kiya jaae
 Ravi and his family are very happy with this justice
 16 saal kii umr main kho gai thi ravi kii ankhon kii roshni lekin kadi mehnat karke ravi ne 2006 main iees kaa imtihaan paas kiya
 Despite this, Ravi did not get a job
 kaha gaya ki netraheenon ke cote ke tahat koi vaikansee nahin he
 Even if Ravi pleads with Kat, there is no use
 cat ke faisle ke khilaaf ravi ne hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 Ravi finally got justice from the court
 baharhaal ant bhala to sab bhala
 Even after a lot of troubles, Ravi achieved his position and proved that no hard work and the desire to do anything is in the mind, then no destination is far away

 ’sam pitrodaki aguai main gujarat kaa daura kar rahi congress team ko rahul gandhi ne alag alag virgon kii raay jutaney ke liye kaha he
 Among these, education, health, issues related to farmers, small and medium enterprises, housing, etc
 are important which can be prominently placed in the manifesto
 sam pitrodane saaf kiya ki unki bhoomika sirf menifesto taiyaar karne tak hi simit nahin he
 Sam Pitrodane said, 'I have no political position nor do i want to
 lekin agar congress gujarat main chunaav jitati he or jo log bhi satta main aaenge, meraa kaam un par ye dabaav daalana hoga ki wo un kaamon ko praathamikta ke aadhaar par karen jinka vaada ham apane menifesto main karne ja rahe hai

 The passport dispute between Tanvi Seth and Anas Siddiqui in Lucknow is now over
 kshetreey karyaalay ne buudhvaar ko danpati ko passport jari kar die gaye
 For the last 15 days, this controversy has been discussed a lot in the news from social media, even Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj has been trolled on Twitter in this matter
 sthaneey passport adhikari piyush verma ne bataaya ki tanvi seth or anas siddiki ke passport jari kar diye gayi hai
 As per the June 2018 rules of the Ministry of External Affairs, in the six important points in the police report, if there is no criminal case on the applicant and there is no dispute over his citizenship, then the passport cannot be stopped
 isi aadhaar par tanvi or anas ko passport jari kiya gaya he
 An internal inquiry by the government has found that the passport officer of Lucknow was wrong to ask irrelevant questions about religion to a hindu-muslim couple who had submitted their application to the office for documents
 sutron ne bataaya ki passport jari karne ke liye jaruri satyaapan prakriya ke samay unke awaas or anya apraasangik byora jutaney main uttar pradesh police ne bhi galati kii
 According to the information, it was wrong to ask for the marriage certificate of the passport officer Vikas Mishra, who questioned Tanvi Seth
 niyamon ke mutabik anya dastavejon ke sahi paae jane par passport ke liye is certificate kii zarurat nahin padati he
 Once the police passport is issued after verification, re-verification is required only after criminal records and citizenship issues
 sutron ke mutabik is maamle main dampati ke khilaaf aisa koi record nahin tha isi vajah se passport ke liye dobaaraa police satyaapan kii koi zarurat nahin thi
 It has been reported that Vikas Mishra has been posted in Gorakhpur under routine transfer and has not been suspended
 kya he maamalatnvi seth or anas siddiki ne passport adhikari par dharm ke naam par apamaanit karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Tanvi's passport was given to her in a hurry after the controversy broke out
 passporidhikari vikaas mishrane tanvi seth kii shaadi ke baad naam badal kar sadiya anas rakhe jane or badale naam ke kollam ko khaali chhod die jane par tanvi se sawaal puche the
 Also, while staying in Noida, he was questioned on giving the address of Lucknow
 is maamle ko tool pakadte hi passport adhikari vikaas mishra kaa lakhanu se gorakhpur kaa tabadalaa tak kar diya gaya
 Please tell that Mohammad Anas Siddiqui and his wife Tanvi Seth married in 2007 and they applied for passport in Lucknow

 According to this cabinet note, the Cabinet of Delhi gave a relaxation to all government departments on the basis of the note prepared by Rajendra Kumar that they would be able to outsourcing manpower from a company named ICSIL
 saath hi guide line main ye bhi likhaa gaya ki iske liye vibhaagon ko kisi tender kii zarurat nahin hogi balki ICSIL se sabhi sarkari vibhaag sidhe bhartee kar sakenge
 ICSIL is accused of benefiting Rajendra Kumar's private companies, but ICSIL is a public sector under-taking, but this company outsources its work to other private companies
 niyat par sawaal isliye uthta he kyonki 5 oktober 2015 ke cabinet note or iske baad 8 disambar 2015 ke ek or circular ke mutabik ICSIL ko dilli sarkaar ne bina tender outsorcing kaa adhikaar de diya
 While the same company was accused of benefiting the alleged private companies of Rajendra Kumar, the principal secretary of CM Kejriwal

 It was alleged that ICSIL benefited private companies which were allegedly front companies of Rajendra Kumar
 jaahir hedilli sarkaarake tamaam mahakamon main outsorcing kaa kaam bina tender ke isi company ko milanaa ab tamaam sawaal khadey kar rahaa he
 Because this proposal was also prepared by Rajendra Kumar
 gauratlab he ki pichhali congress sarkaar ke vakt bhi ye gorakhdhandha jari tha, jisaki shikaayat sibiai se bhi kii gai thi
 The payments made by ICSIL in Delhi's government departments also take a look at the payments made by the Delhi government's government departments that ICSIL has made at different times
 artiai ke jariye mili jaankaree ke mutabik 2014 se july 2016 ke bich kiya gaya
 This includes post-payment of the order of the Kejriwal government
 sabase zyada bhugtan tihaad jail ne kiya he
 The Tihar Jail has so far paid ICSIL 2
5 crores for manpower outsourcing
 disi south east ke daftar ne bhi july 2016 tak kareeb sava karod rupee kaa bhugtan kiya ja chukaa he
 The Delhi Pollution Control Board has also paid nearly one crore from 2014 to July 2016
 dm south ke daftar ne bhi ICSIL ko ek karod se zyada kaa bhugtan kiya he
 The Chief Electoral Officer's office has also paid 12 lakhs

 'sanders ne bayaan main kaha, 'pakistan dwaara said par abhiyog lagane main asafal rahane ke baad said kii rihaai se antarrashtriya aatankwaad kaa muqabla karne main pakistan kii patibaddhta ko lekar galat sandesh gaya he or pakistan ke ve daawey jhuthe sabit hue hai, jisamen pakistan ne kaha tha ki vah apni dharti kaa upyog aatankwaadiyon ko panaah dene ke taur par nahin karne degaa

 Let the Pakistani court release the terrorist Hafiz on 22 November

 Koli, who was imprisoned in a Ghaziabad jail, was given death sentence in the murder of Rimpa Haldar and four other cases
 nai endie sarkaar banane ke baad faansee kii sajaa kaa yah pehla maamla hoga
 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh had already recommended to President Pranab Mukherjee within a month of assuming office as minister that Koli's mercy petition be rejected
 raashtrapati ne 27 july ko dayaa yachika khaarij kar di thi, jisase coli ko faansee par latakaae jane kii nyaayik prakriya ko shuru karne kaa rasta saaf ho gaya tha
 There are 11 murder cases pending against Koli

 According to the farmers, elections are also like fields where five crop harvest season comes once a year
 jab hal chalata he to bagulon kii tarah netaa bhi janata ke peeche bhaagate hai
 After sowing the crop, no one comes to peek
 kheti bhagwaan bharose hi ho jaati he, netaa bas fasal kaatane aate hai
 The farmers do not have hope with this attitude of the leaders, but if there is an election, they will vote

 Another book alleged that PV Narasimha Rao had 'silent consent' in the demolition of Babri Masjid
 kitaab main daawa kiya gaya he ki jab karsevakon ne masjid ko giraanaa shuru kiya tab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri puja par baithe or vah masjid ke puri tarah se gir jane ke baad hi puja se uthe
 Renowned journalist Kuldeep Nayyar has mentioned the incident of December 6, 1992 in his book Beyond the Lines
 roli books is pustak kaa prakaashan kar rahaa he
 This book will be released soon
 naiyar ne likhaa he, ‘meri soochna thi ki masjid giraae jane main raav kii maun sahmati thi
 When the kar sevaks started demolishing the mosque, he sat on the puja and when the last stone was also removed, he got up from the puja
 ’ There is also a chapter in the book on Narasimha Rao Sarkar
 isamen kaha gaya he, ‘madhu limaye (divangat samaajawaadee netaa) ne baad main mujhe bataaya tha ki puja ke dauraan raav ke sahyogi ne unke kaan main kaha ki masjid gira di gai he
 Pooja ended a few moments later
 ’ PP Ranga Rao, son of the late Narasimha Rao, completely rejected the claim, calling it unreliable and unconfirmed
 madhu limaye ke kathith daawey par pratikriya vyakt karte hue ranga raav ne kaha, ‘yah avishwasaneey or apusht he
 
 
 My father could not do that
 babari masjid giraae jane se vah kaaphi dukhi the
 
 
 He told us many times that this should not have happened
 ’ Ranga Rao regretted that journalists like Nayyar could write such things
 unhone kaha ki nihit swaarth ke kaaran unke pita ke khilaaf vishavaman kiya ja rahaa he jabaki vah apana bachaav karne ke liye jivit nahin hai
 Nayyar has written that when riots broke out after the mosque was demolished, Rao invited some senior journalists to his house
 ‘vah dukhi man se bataa rahe the ki kis prakaar unki sarkaar ne masjid ko bachaane ke liye har prayaas kiya lekin uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri kalyaan singh ne vishwasghaat kiya
 ' yah puche jane par ki kalyaan singh sarkaar ko bakhrast kar die jane ke baad jab shashan centre ke paas tha to ratorat vahaan ek chota mandir kaise ban gaya, raav ne kaha ki unhone siarpief kii ek tukdi vimaan se lakhanu bhejne kii koshish kii lekin kharaab mausam ke kaaran vimaan utar nahin sakaa
 Nayyar wrote that Rao could not provide any explanation even though there was no action by the central forces in Ayodhya although he assured that the temple would not stay there for long
 unhone likhaa he, ‘‘babari masjid giraae jane ke liye raav kii sarkaar ko hameshaa jimmedaar tehraaya jayega
 Interestingly, he feared such an incident but took virtually no step to avoid it
 ’’ us samay kalyaan singh uttar pradesh sarkaar ke mukhiya the
 His statements indicated that he had no intention of protecting the mosque
 haalanki ucchtam nyaayalay ne yathasthiti banaae rakhane kaa aadesh diya tha or unki sarkaar ne vachan diya tha ki vah aisa karegi
 The event reached a climax when thousands of kar sevaks removed the last stone of the magistrate that day
 unhone likhaa he, ‘‘yah dharmanirpekshata kii dindahaade hatya thi
 According to Nayar, the Congress camp was in a tizzy but it was not about the demolition of the mosque but the internal strife
 sonia gandhi narsingh raav ko pasand nahin karti thim khaskar jab raav ne congress party or sarkaar donon kaa netritv sambhaal liya
 Many Congress leaders had requested Sonia to take over the leadership of the party
 un netaaon kaa maananaa tha ki sirf vahi party main sarvasammati bana sakati hai
 Sonia was concerned that the BJP representing communal forces was gaining political advantage
 naiyar ne likhaa he ki unhone ek baar sonia se baatcheet kii thi
 Sonia looked strongly secular in this

 The government of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, had spied Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's family for nearly two decades

 It is getting longer and stronger too, although it cannot be said to be fat till now
 abhi use skool main angreji sikhaai ja rahi he jisamen uskaa kaaphi man lagata he
 'this letter was written by Emily Schenkel, wife of Subhan Chandra Boseki, from Austria, who had overcome the world war
 unki ekaaki jindagi main bachi kuch ummiido main ek unki beti thi
 The letter was sent to Netaji's nephew Shishir Kumar Bose in remote Kolkata, but it was read before reaching there
 yah pehla khat nahin tha jise padhaa gaya tha
 Even before he was read, several Intelligence Bureau (IB) officers had quietly made copies of the letter and placed it in secret files belonging to the Bose family
 aadhi sadi se zyada samay tak isaki or aise tamaam patron kii pratiyaan kolkata sthit rajya ibi mukhyalay ke daraajon main band padi thim
 Recently, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs removed the issue of secrecy from it and has been kept in the National Archives of Delhi
 ye filein aaazaad bharat ke daagdar sarkari raaj se paradaa uthaati hai
 That is, for two decades between 1948 and 1968, the government had extensively spied the members of the Bose family
 sarkari jasoos us swatantraaa senaanee ke parijanon ke patr padhate or darj karte rahe jo 25 varsh tak nehru kaa rajnatik sahakarmi rahaa tha
 The detectives of the IB continued to chase the family members during their domestic and foreign visits and record the finer details of those they met and what they said
 yah nigaraanee bilkul usee tarj par thi jaisaa aaj kisi vaanchit aatankwaadi ke parivaar par rakhi jaati he-behad saghan, vyavasthit or satarkta bhari
 These revelations have shocked the Bose family
 netaji ke bhattije ke bete chandra kumaar bose sawaal uthaate hai, 'nigaraanee un par rakhi jaati he jinhone koi aparaadh kiya ho yaa jinke aatanki taar jude hon
 Netaji and his family fought for freedom, then what was the need to keep an eye on him? 'anita bose-foff, the only daughter of Subhash Chandra Bose, is an economist in Germany
 ve bhi in khulaason se sakate main hai
 She says, 'my uncle (sharat Chandra Bose) was politically active till the fifties and the Congress was opposed to the then leadership, but the thing that shocked me is that my cousin and sister were also in the realm of security
 From the point of view it did not make any sense
 'kaum ke bhatke sipaahi the netaa ji!netaji ne japan main bhartiya yudhbandiyon ko saath lekar aaazaad hind fouj (iene) banaai thi jiske sahare unhone aaazaad bharat kii asthai sarkaar kaa gathan kiya

 iske turant baad 1944 main japani sena kii haar ne iene ko lautne ko majaboor kar daalaa
 On August 18, 1945, 48-year-old Netaji is believed to have died in a plane crash in Taiwan, three days after Japan succumbed to Allied military forces
 naaraaz he bose parivarbose parivaar in khulaason par bahut naaraaz he or uski maang he ki centre sarkaar beete 60 varshon se apane kabje main rakhi netaji se judi top atigopneey filon ko teji se saarvajanik karne kaa kaam kare
 They believe that these documented revelations are just a mere glimpse

 The government has been continuously hindering their work
 rajnath singh jab bijepi ke adhyaksh the, tab pichley saal unhone katak main kaha tha, 'samoochaa desh yah jaanane ko baichaiyn he ki netaji kii maut kaise or kin paristhitiyon main hui
 Speaking on his anniversary last year, he promised that Netaji's files would be made public if his government came to power
 aaj ve sarkaar main hai lekin uski pratikriya bhi upie jaisi hi he
 On 2 February last, the Prime Minister's Office told RTI activist Subhash Chandra Aggarwal that the inauguration of Netaji's files with the PMO "may prejudicially affect relations with other countries
" ' piemo ne bilkul aisa hi jawaab 'mishan netaji' ko diya he
 This is a pressure group of some activists who have been fighting the battle to make these files public since 2006
 bose parivaar kii jasusiangreji raaj main siidi 1930 ke dashak se hi kolkata-1 sthit bose parivaar ke do makaanon kii nigaraanee kar rahi thi- 1, woodburn park kaa makaan tha or doosraa tha 38@2, elgin road
 This was the time when Sharat Chandra and his younger brother Subhash Chandra Bose emerged as the leaders of the independence movement in Bengal
 parivaar ko siidi ke saae kii aadat pad chuki thi
 It is known from this incident that once a CID officer seized a letter sent to Sharat Chandra in the middle and got a copy of it, but accidentally sent a copy to him
 jab vah apni galati ko swikaarne bose parivaar ke paas aayaa to bade bhai ne usase kaha ki kuch din baad aakar use le jaae
 Netaji was placed under house arrest in 1941
 ve police ko chakma dekar elgin road vaale makaan se nikal gaye or naaji shashan vaale germany main jaakar ruke
 The British then called him an ally of the fascist forces and increased surveillance on their families
 jaisaa ki saarvajanik kiye gaye dastavej dikhaate hai, aaazaad bharat kii sarkaar bhi is parivaar par utani hi mustaidi se nigaraanee rakhti rahi thi

 Netaji's two nephews Shishir Kumar Bose and Amiya Nath Bose did not have much political weight at the time they were being monitored
 dastavejon ke mutabik ibi ne jab un par apni nigaraanee dhili kar di thi, uske kai saal baad unhone chunaav ladaa
 Amiya Nath was elected as an MP from Arambagh in 1968 on the All India Forward Bloc ticket while Shishir Bose was elected MLA in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1987 on a Congress ticket
 aisa lagata he ki ibi ko is baat main zyada dilchaspee thi ki bose parivaar kya karata he or kisase miltaa he
 a series of handwritten messages that have been made public show that IB agents used to call IB headquarters "security Control" to give information about the family's antics, although it was only through family letters that IB could find out what the family was doing
 Is thinking is patrachaar main netaji kaa zikr khub hota tha
 Obviously, what else would the family talk about? These letters were largely about general family issues
 netaji kii patni apane khaton main parivaar ke aarthik sankat, beti ke paalan-poshan or vienna vaale makaan kii marammat kaa zikr karti thim
 From Kolkata, the Bose family used to send them money for running the expenses
 ibi ne in patron main un hisson ko rekhaankit kiya he jinamein emily shenkal ke mulakatiyon ke naam hai
 This shows what Ib was interested in
 aise hi 1953 main likhe patr par ibi kii tippanee emily ko ''shri subhash chandra bose kii kathith patni'' qaraar detii he
 The response of Krishna Bose, 85-year-old wife of Marhum Shishir Kumar Bose, was overturned by the documents, which were made public in the house at 38 @ 2 Elgin Road, which has become the Netaji Bhawan Museum, "it is very mysterious and shocking!" After all, why did they want to follow us? ”she has been a three-time Lok Sabha MP from the Trinamool Congress
 ve is baat par hansatii hai ki yah jasusi kitni asardaar rahi hogi kyonki parivaar ko iskaa koi andaja nahin tha
 She says, "my husband used to say that while going to the hospital or boarding the tram, he felt that he was being followed
" 
 
 par yah angrejon ke daur kii baat thi
 Looking at these detective revelations, one gets an idea of how an IB used to work in the world's oldest intelligence agencies
 jo chitthiyaan jabt kii jaati thim, unki nigaraanee kaa centre takreeban puri tarah elgin road daakghar hua karata tha jahaan bina kisi andeh ke bose parivaar apni chitthiyaan daalata tha
 Family members raised their doubts on the Shahnawaz Commission set up in 1956
 chachaa ko manyata na dene se upji niraashaa kaa bhi izhaar kiya tha
 In 1955, Shishir Bose wrote to Netaji's wife, "if you had been in India today, you would have realized that only two people were important in India's freedom struggle - Gandhi and Nehru

 This man was the head of internal security in Nehru's government, which was the head of the IB for 16 consecutive years between 1948 and 1964
 yah jasusi rajnatik rup se samvedansheel thi, isamen koi do raay nahin he
 The "top Secret" and "very Secret" seal on the files used to decide that only a handful of officers would have access to these files
 ye filein kolkata kii pretoria street sthit ibi ke rajya mukhyalay main steel kii bani daraajon main rakhi jaati thim, jo bose ke ghar se kuch hi duuri par he
 Anuj Dhar, author and activist of India's Biggest cover-up, a book on the mysteries associated with Netaji, says, "when the Bhadralok of Bengal was taking a look at Byomkesh Bakshi, a fanciful man who solved petty crimes, the IB detectives were Among the exploits were Mubtila, in front of whom CIA and KGB would have had to fill water

 As India's economy is cash based, the circulation of counterfeit notes remains a major problem
