 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a two-day visit to UP
 is daure ke pehle din shanivaar ko piem modi pehle azamgarh gaye or uske baad apane sansadeey kshetra varanasi pahunche
 At night, he suddenly left the guest house and went to visit the Banaras Hindu University Campus
 piem modi ne uniwarsity parisar main vishwanath mandir main puja-archana kii
 Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath was also present along with PM Modi
 darasal, piem modi yahaan ke direka guest house main ruke hue the
 At night, he got out of his car from the guest house and reached the BHU campus
 piem modi ne varanasi shahar main hue vikaas or saundarikaran ke kaaryon kaa jayja bhi liya
 PM Modi left Varanasi's Dereka and reached Viswanath temple built inside BHU via Sundarpur, Narian
 mandir main darshan karne ke baad pradhanmantri modi apane kafile ke saath lanka, gurudham ravindrapuri, bheloopur, madanapura, goduliya, chowk, maidagin, lahurabir, andharapul, ambedkar chauraahaa, circuit house, nadesar, kaint railway stesan, lahartara hote hue waapas raatri vishram ke liye direka guest house laute

 Further, PM Modi said that it takes more time and labor to do such work, but a permanent system is being established

 As soon as this matter comes up, the politics of Bihar has become hot once again
 saath hi iske peeche bihar kii satta se rajd kaa bedakhal hona bhi ek bada kaaran mana ja rahaa he
 RJD leaders say that why these threats are received only by RJD people and also those who are publicly vocal against Janata Dal United and Nitish Kumar
 harsh vihaar main ek chaatr kii uske hi doston ne peet-petakar hatya kar di
 All this was happening in the presence of the people of the area but no save came forward
 17 saal kaa rajan shaam ko patang udaane gaya tha lekin tabhi kisi baat par doston main jhagada ho gadha
 But those friends suddenly became enemies and the four boys killed Rajan so much that he died
 mritak ke rishtedaar ne bataaya ki rajan ne khelte vakt kisi ladke ko uskaa naam naa lekar use kaaliya kah diya tha
 Angered by this, the boy along with his three companions beat Rajan and his partner Gurudev badly with kick punches
 pitane waalon main keval rajan hi nahin tha
 Gurudev, another student of the area, was also beaten fiercely by those miscreants
 gurudev kii haalat najuk bani hui he

 Even after three months of demonetisation, the cash crunch has not completely gone away
 dilli or mumbai main kai atm ab bhi khaali pade hai, to vahiin jin atm main paise hai vahaan logon kii lambii katare hai
 At the same time, political parties are questioning the intention of the government behind this and alleges that the atms of other places are being filled empty in electoral states to take advantage of the assembly elections
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 8 november ko jab 500 or 1000 rupee ke puranenoton kaa chalan bandakarne kaa elaan kiya tha, tab unhone 50 dinon tak nakadi kii takalif kii baat kahi thi, lekin is ghoshnaa ke teen maheene baad bhi halaat saamaanya nahin hue hai
 There are many atms in the Maharani Bagh area of the capital Delhi, but local residents say that during the last four days only one of them was poured in cash, the rest of the atms are empty
 usee atm kii qatari main lage rahul singh kehete hai, 'yahaan par aasapaas kareeb 10 atm hai
 When i needed the money, i walked around the ATM, but not the note
 aakhir main bas yah ek atm dikhaa he, jahaan paise nikal rahe the
 There is also a long line here, but if needed, stood in line
 'dilli kii sattadhariam aadmi partirajdhani ke atm main nakadi kii kami ke peeche centre kii narendra modi nit bijepi sarkaar par aarope lagaate hai
 They believe that since the first phase of Uttar Pradesh elections, all the notes are being sent to UP, there is no refilling of notes in atms in Delhi

 party ke vichaar or raajnneeti kii ab tak kii dhara se alag chaal na sirf bharat balki padosi mulk pakistan ke logon ko bhi khub raas aa rahi he
 This is the reason that a new party with the same name has now emerged in Pakistan
 yani ab pakistan main bhi 'aam aadmi party' ban chuki he
 According to the information, the human rights activist arslan-ul-mulk of Gujranwala, Pakistan and his group have got their party registered in the name of Aam Aadmi Party in Pakistan Election Commission
 party pramukh mulk kehete hai ki unki party pakistan ke founder mohammad ali jinna ke sapanom ke pakistan kaa nirmaan karegi
 
 
 
 sirf naam nahin tarika bhi vahidilachasp baat yah he ki pakistan kii aam aadmi party na sirf naam balki taur-tareekon main bhi arvind kejariwal kii party kaa anukaran karti dikhaai de rahi he
 The Pakistani AAP has announced that it will soon hold a sit-in demonstration and hunger strike outside the Punjab Assembly
 party netaaon kaa kahana he ki unka yah pradarshan police riform or anti tolerance bill kii maang ko lekar hoga
 Party chief arslan-ul-mulk says, 'is today's Pakistan what Mohammad Ali Jinnah dreamed of? Is this the country where all are equal and are tasting freedom? Today both the country's power and the bureaucracy have forgotten why Pakistan was created
 hamaari party pakistan ke sansthaapak ke sapanom ko puraa karegi

 Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar on Tuesday refused to play in the Twenty20 World Cup to be held in the West Indies this year and said he was firm on his stand not to play T20 internationals

 i have not played Twenty20 Internationals since 2007 and i don't think that is an issue now
 ’ As many new pink notes have been found in raids after demonetisation, it will take several decades to line up and raise them under the current limits to withdraw cash
 kise andaaj tha ki bank hi kaale dhan kii dhulaai karne lagenge, gali-gali main puraani karency badalane kii deal hone lagengi or jaanch agenciyon ko gali-koochon kii khaak chanani padegi
 The whole scenario is like Aunt Claimix appearing in the Sukhaant tale
 lagata he ki notebandi se hona kuch tha, jabaki kuch or hi hone laga he
 You might want to revisit the activism of the Income Tax Department and other agencies, but the reality is that demonetisation has heavily equipped the basic causes of corruption in India before producing any good results
 1
 Shortage and scarcity is the biggest reason for corruption
 karency kisi arthvyavastha kii sabase aadharbhoot seva he
 Shortage of cash means lack of everything
 yah grand madar of shortages he, jo har tarah ke bhrashtachar ke liye makul he
 2
 bhrashtachar kii duusari sabase badi vajah afasaron va netaaon ke vivekadhikaar hai yani ki kursi kii takat
 The sight of this power had started with demonetisation, which will now grow rapidly
 maang va aapurti main antar bharat main bhrashtachar kaa sabase mahatvapurn kaaran he
 All studies by domestic and foreign agencies and ngos (transparency International's Bribe Payers and Corruption Index, etc
) have shown that there is a big difference in demand and supply of facilities in most departments, institutions, services or organizations in which bribes are given
 
 bharat kii 70 fisadi rishwatein is killat ke bich apana kaam nikaalane ke liye di jaati hai
 The shortage in supply of phones, LPG, automobiles, cement is over, so they do not have to pay bribe to get them
 bharat main 90 fisadi vinimay kaa aadhaar nakadi he
 If there is a shortage, then there were endless opportunities for corruption
 notebandi ke tahat 86 fisadi karency ko band karne ke baad puraa mulk, taaja itihaas kii sabase badi killat se jujhane laga he
 In the first week of demonetisation, new ways of replacing old notes came out
 uske agle ek saptaah main to gali-gali main deal shuru ho gai, kyonki bainkon ke pichley daravaaje se nikaali gai nai karency bazaar main pahunchane lagi thi
 By the end of the first fortnight of demonetisation, the biggest event of retail money laundering had begun in India which continues till now
 notebandi or noton kii killat ne bharat main puraane nae noton ke vinimay kii kai anadhikarik daren bana deen jaisaa ki haal main venezuela or zimbabwe main dekha gaya he
 The scarcity of cash is more terrible than other shortages because it is the only way of supply in the economy, it is through its use that there is buying, selling, production, demand and growth
 bazaar maang buree tarah tut gai, upabhokta kharid thap ho gai or jaruri chizon kii aapurti simit hone lagi
 It is possible that the inflation demand in November is a breakdown of demand
 lekin agar nakadi kii hi killat ho jaae to phir bhrashtachar kii seemaa nahin bachegi
 This is what happened in demonetisation
 nakadi kii killat ke baad sabhi kshetron main utpaadan ghatega, jiske saamaanya hone main ek saal lag saktaa he
 After this, there will be scarcity of things which can return inflation
 killat se un afasaron va netaaon ko akut takat milti he jinke paas saamaanya suvidhaayen dene se lekar haq or nyaay baantne ke adhikaar hai
 During the cash crunch, bank officials practically became the country's most powerful bureaucrat
 unhone apane visheshadhikaar kaa jamkar istemaal kiya or iske baad jo hua, puure desh main nae noton kii baramadagi ke taur par saamne aa rahaa he
 However, this does not end here
 notebandi ke dauraan chhapemari yaa khaaton kii jaanch inspector raaj kaa nayaa daur shuru karegi
 The work of checking about 144 crore accounts will be solely responsible for 15 thousand income tax officers
 agar har khate ko kaayade se jaancha jaae to das saal lagenge
 Hence notices will be issued in bulk
 adhikari apane tareeke se tay karenge ki kiskaa dhan kaala he or kiskaa safed
 In this process, there is scope to create a lot of pink money
 bataate chalem ki iskar or pravartan nideshaalay kii karravaaiyaan hi sirf surkhiyaan banati hai, unki jaanch or doshiyon ko sajaa dene kaa record bataane laayak nahin he
 a week after demonetisation, we wrote in this column (cleaning with dirty hands) that the most dirty departments have got the responsibility of this new cleanliness campaign
 ek maah bitate-bitate ashankaayen sach ho gai hai
 The government is also accepting the economic damage of demonetisation
 ab chunauti in nuksaanon ke saamne phaayde khadey karne kii he
 After completing this process, the government will have to run two campaigns immediately
 jin sevaaon main sabase zyada bhrashtachar he, unamem buniyadi dhaanche or aapurti kii kami dur kerani hogi
 2
 afasaron or netaaon ke vivekadhikaar simit karne ke liye sarkaar kii takat kam kerani hogi or samaaj va mukt bazaar kii takat badhaani hogi
 Famous economist Milton Freedman said that governments bring solutions to problems that are worse than problems
 agar notebandi ke baad jaruri sevaaon va suvidhaon kii aapurti nahin badi or netaa-naukarshahon ke adhikaar kam nahin hue to na keval freedman ek baar phir sahi sabit honge balki bhrashtachar doguni takat se lautne laga he or is baar vah pehle se zyada chaalaak va chaikanna he
 There are two routes to reach the sacred cave of Amarnath
 ek rasta pahalgam se shuru hota he to doosraa balatal se
 The path to Pahalgam is long but the climb is easy, while climbing through Baltal is a bit difficult, the good thing is that due to the short route, travelers can return to visit Baba Barfani in a single day
 ye rasta qareeb 45 kilometre lanbaa he
 Starting from Pahalgam, Chandanwadi comes about 16 km later
 vahaan se 3 kilometre kii chadhaai kar yatri pissutop pahunchate hai
 The distance from Pissotop to Sheshnag is 9 kilometers
 yahaan se qareeb 11 kilometre kii yatra ke baad aata he panjatarani
 Sangam is the next stop after Panjtarni
 ye darasal donon raaston kaa sangam he
 The route coming from Baltal Basecamp is also found at Sangam
 balatal se 2 kilometre upar chadhakar dumel aata he
 5 kilometers from there, the Bari courtyard and the Sangam comes after 4 kilometers from Bari
 sangam se amarnath gufa kii duuri sirf 3 kilometre rah jaati he

 He wrote, Rajnath has been the Minister of Agriculture in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government

 25-year-old Jahangir started a small business in a Gandhi Market area adjoining New Delhi with a debt embroidery machine
 notebandi ke baad unka kaarobaar chapat ho gaya, ve sadak par aa gaye or unke paanch majdoor berozegaar ho gaye
 As a result, he had to return to his village in East Champaran district of Bihar
 tab unhone deshhit main is faisle ko sirmathe par liya
 But, after a long wait, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released demonetisation data in its annual report on August 30, stating that the notes of out of circulation currency after the Prime Minister's announcement on November 8, 2016, about 99 Percentage share returned to banks
 hangir ko shaayad iskaa matlab samaj na aae lekin iskaa ek matlab yah bhi he ki notebandi kaa puraa tamzam takreeban bemakasad chalaa gaya
 The announcement of the Prime Minister's ban on demonetisation was seen as a strong move to ban black money, rein in counterfeit notes and ban cash aid to terrorist organizations
 lekin arabiai ke aankadon se alag hi tasviir ubhar rahi he, or yah aankada notebandi ke auchity par hi sawaal khadaa kar rahaa he
 All the black money in the system seems to have returned
 vaise, arabiai kii report main is baat zikr nahin he ki 500 ru

 This averages 0 in the case of k notes

 Former Finance Minister P
 chidambaram ne notebandi ke faisle par sawaal uthaate hue ise sarkaar kii naakaami qaraar diya
 Chidambaram tweeted, "demonetisation was a scheme to turn black money white when 99 per cent of the notes were legally exchanged?" Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi also spoke out and asked the government by tweeting, "this (demonetization) government Has a very big failure
 jisaki vajah se kai nirdosh jindagiyaan chali gayi or arthvyavastha tabah ho gai
 Will the PM take responsibility for this? ”CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury also said,“ Demonetisation has caused huge damage to the economy
 yah ek raashtra-virdohi krity he
 The poor were the worst affected by demonetisation
 ''vipaksh kaa aarope sahi he kyonki notebandi ke baad arthvyavastha aundhe munh ja giri
 Economic growth rate decreased to 6 in the first quarter of 2017

 sangathit or aupchaarik arthvyastha ke charmarane ke daur main chote kaarobaariyon, dihadi mazdooron or choti ikaayiyon kaa vakt bahut bura gujara
 Now the government is giving arguments in its defense
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha, ''notebandi ke peeche kisi kaa paisa jabt karne kaa makasad nahin tha or banking system main paisa aa jaae iskaa matlab yah nahin ki puraa paisa vaid he
 Jaitley, while enumerating the benefits of demonetisation, said that the direct effect of this is that new taxpayers, both direct and indirect, are connected
 jetali ne yah bhi kaha ki notebandi kejariye cashles arthvyavastha ko badhaava dena tha
 But according to RBI data, cash transactions have gained momentum once the ATM services are repaired and digital transactions have once again reached the level of earlier demonetisation
 vaise, july 2016 se june 2017 tak arabiai ne nae noton kii chapai or unke vitaran main 7,965 karod ru

 Along with this, in the flood of cash with banks, RBI gave a discount to banks in deposits under reverse repo and Rs 20 thousand crore in its surplus

 For liquidity management, the government has also given Rs 11,000 crore to banks

 The government may be serious on black money, but the government has lost an opportunity by keeping real estate out of the GST ambit, it remains to be seen what Modi will do for the withdrawal of black money deposited like mud in benami property, gold and real estate

 Their dialogue, style become part of our language and culture
 masalan, mughal e ajam kaa muhaavara, pyaar kiya to darana kya
 Or many dialogues of Sholay
 holi kab he se lekar kitne aadmi the tak
 And speaking of the recent cult, i came three years ago
 tohfa kubul karo se lekar ol ij wel tak
 Now we are telling you about some trends, words and ways starting with the next cult film 'PK'
 padhein film pike kaa rivyuu1
 Gola: The new name for our Mother Earth
 pike ise gola kahata he
 He speaks while hurting religious leaders
 kya lagata he aapako
 This is a small sphere
 uskaa ek chota sa shahar, uske chote se insaan aap
 You will save God
 ishwar aapke bharose he
 So Guys and Girls, Gola is in
 ham us gol ke vaasi hai, jise dharti kehete hai
 2
 thappajaaye muhar ke liye istemaal hone vaala shabd he
 But only in a few areas
 ab ye puure desh main bolaa jayega
 PK wants to know how someone knows which religion it is
 use lagata he ki jarur bhagwaan sabake pichhawaade par thappa lagaakar bhejtaa hoga
 3
 phirkirkaagaj kaa ek khilonaa
 Which we used to learn to make in book art class
 bans kii tandi par lagaaya or hawa ke sahare udaaya
 But spin also means having fun
 khaastaur par usase, jisane aapke dimag main charas bo rakhi ho
 Jagadjanani alias Jaggu taught us this
 4
 Rong number: till now it used to mean abhidha
 ab dharmik baabaaon ke prapanchon par sawaal uthaane main bhi hoga
 PK feels Babaji's intention is correct
 magar vah bhagwaan se baat karne ke liye rong number laga rahe hai
 Then the devotees also start asking Baba
 ki aap rong number kyon laga rahe hai
 People are talking about retirement, living in expensive cars, luxurious ashrams themselves
 5
 PK: We have been using many terms for alcoholics till now
 piyakkad, daarubaaj, didi (daily drinkar), sharaabi vagairah vagairah
 Shubha was there before some film
 pike aayaa he kya to suna tha
 What is PK? ye film main suna
 Not Akhara
 or ab lagata he ki mehfilbaajon ke bich somras kapyar pike he kya ke rup main sunai degaa
 6
 god kaa tatunkuch matvaale gaal par bhagwaan kaa tatu lagaae theme party main dikh jaaen to chaunkiega mat
 They have a hangover of PK
 pike kaa funda he
 The photo of God stops humans
 peshaab rukvaani he, diwaar par bhagwaan laga do
 He extends it on the cheek
 gaal par bhagwaan kaa steekar chipka lo
 No one will kill 7
 Transistors: People are removing it anew
 badi dadhi, betaratib bal, cigar or gamche vaale kuch nasheman shaayar, kavi, kalakaar ho saktaa he ab aapako humayun ke makbare kii dhoop main radio taange bhi najar aa jaaen
 With the transistor, one end of pk's love story takes hold
 dekhen, log is sire ko kandhe par kab tak taangte hai
 8
 gullak khalidharmaguruon or mandiron ke khate main kuch vakt ko hi sahi downfall aa saktaa he
 PK questions all this without being hurt
 jisane sab ko diya, ham use ghoose kyon dete hai
 PK then withdraws his bribe one by one
 bhagwaan ko paise kii kya jarurat
 The needy need dena he to unhen do
 So now the piggy bank will be filled
 magar mandiron kii nahin
 Where it should be filled
 9
 Baagli of Ugrasen: People go, Leh Ladakh
 ek sundar jhil ke kinare tasviir khinchvaate
 Again, it is a lake with three idiots
 ab ye chalan dilli shahar main ugrasen kii baawali ke sandarbh main ji uthegaa
 PK is settled here
 madhyakaal kii ye khubasurat baawali ab jhola bharbhar visitors paaegi
 10
 bhojpurihis bhashaa ko abhijatya garib mazdooron kii bhashaa ke rup main dekhtaa aayaa he
 a dialect spoken by rickshaws, khaini eaters
 to kya hua, jobhojpuri behad mithi or samrudh bhashaa he
 In which the beggar Thakur was a color worker
 jise bolne vaale kai deshon ke rashtradhyaksh hai
 For him, Bhojpuri means Guddu Rangeela and Pawan Singh's shallow singing
 magar ab kya
 Now, an elite among them talks in PK Bhojpuri language
 shaayad pehali martabaa aisa hua he, jab shahar kii jameen par ghani basii ek film kaa mukhya nayak is boli main shuru se aakhir tak bole
 Now Bhojpuri pub, cafe or convent can be seen occasionally
 bollywood star shahrukh khan ne aakhirkaar apni beti suhana kii bikni vaali tasviir par chuppi todate hue kuch aisa jawaab diya jisase sabake munh band ho gaye
 Actually, some time ago Suhana's picture was going viral on social media in which she was seen in a two-piece bikini
 unke saath chote bhambrambhi the
 This photo of Suhana's bikini became the subject of much discussion
 haal hi main ek website ko die intervyuu main jab shahrukh se is bare main sawaal kiya gaya to king khan ne kuch is tarah jawaab diya, 'suhana samudr ke kinare apane bhai ke saath bikni main thi
 And the daughter's bikini photo became the headline for the media
 kya ye ghatiya nahin hai? meri beti 16 saal kii he or wo is baat ko lekar kaaphi ocward feel karne lagi
 It is my stardom that such a small thing has been extended so much
 yahi kisi or kii neude tasviir se bhi aapako koi pareshaani na hoti
 But who is my daughter, that's why so much ruckus was raised on this matter
 vaise shahrukh kaa ye jawaab vaaki logon ke munh par taala lagane vaala he
 Because everyone knows that Suhana, Abram or Aryan King Khan's three children are very popular in Bollywood
 aise main unki choti-choti cheez bhi phans ke bich kaaphi popular hone lagati he
 And that's why it is really strange to make fun of such things or to make a ruckus on it

 Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has complained to opener Gautam Gambhir about the BCCI
 dhoni ne kaha he ki team ke hit kii andekhi kar rahe hai gautam gambhir
 a team member has said on the condition of maintaining his secrecy that Dhoni feels that Gambhir puts his talk above the team and because of this he has become self-centered
 isliye dhoni ne unke khilaaf bisisiai ko shikaayat kii he ki gambhir apane swaarth ke chalate team ke liye ghaatak ho gaye hai
 Dhoni has complained that, 'gambhir is working on saving his place in the team
 lagaataar bure form main chal rahe gambhir team ke hit ko andekha kar rahe hai or apane swaarth ko tarjeeh de rahe hai
 Dhoni is most upset that in the second innings of the Mumbai Test, Gambhir stood at the non-striker end and watched the tail batsmen get out and remained unbeaten till the end, while he should have added more runs with the help of the tail batsmen
 
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘kisi turn leti pich par over kii pehali yaa duusari gend par aap single le lete hai or greem swaan or monti panesar jaise boleron ke aage apane puchhlle ballebaajon ko chhod dete hai, isaki peeche kya manshaa ho sakati he
 Team India needed to increase its total at that time which would have given the bowlers some more opportunities
 yahaan prayek ran mahatvapurn tha lekin gambhir ne team main yogadan dene kii jagah darshak banakar duusari chor par khadaa rahanaa munasib samajha
 There was nothing like contributing to the team here
 ’captain kool ne kaha, ‘yahaan main kahana chaahunga ki aswin ne kolkata test main bahut hi jimmedaari se ballebaaji kii or team ke liye out hue bina 91 ran banaaye jabaki wo specialist ballebaaj nahin hai
 He added important runs while leading the tail batsmen and took us away from the innings defeat
 agar aswin aisa kar sakate hai to gambhir kyon nahin?’kolkata test kii pehali pari main virendra sahvaag kaa ran out hona or duusari pari main cheteshwar pujaara kaa ran out hone, jisaki vajah se team bada total nahin khadaa kar saki, kii vajah se dhoni khaase naaraaz najar aae or phir gambhir kaa ye gaiyr-jimmedaarana prayaas
 Dhoni said, 'the one who was guilty in both of these run outs is serious
 sahvaag ke maamle main teen ran dikh rahe the lekin gambhir ne manaa kar diya
 Whereas in Pujara's case, calling Gambhir for one run was a wrong decision
 captain dhoni ne kaha, ‘fin ke khilaaf gambhir acha nahin khel paa rahe the to unhone non striker and par khadey rahane kaa sochaa or ek ran ke liye bhaage or pujaara ko out hona padaa
 i agree that Gambhir did nothing deliberately
 main unki nishtha par prashn nahin uthaa rahaa hum
 He did this only to overcome his bad form
 lekin unhone apane form ko waapas laane ke liye team hit ko daanv par lagaaya he
 'this source said,' though Gambhir and Dhoni have a good relationship
 gambhir ne is siries main ardhashatak jamaaya he or puraane form main lautate dikh rahe hai
 If he is successful in removing the spider web sitting in his mind, then he will prove to be a dangerous opponent
 unhen team kaa samarthan praapt he
 Before the next match, a BCCI official will talk to them on this issue and this issue will be resolved
 yah jaruri he ki sabhi team member agle match par focus karen or acha se acha yogadan dene kii koshish karen
 During this time, a close associated with Gambhir said, 'it is true that this opener has not performed to the best of his ability in this series but Dhoni's own captaincy is in danger, then he juggles to prove Gambhir weak
 Are adopting unhen lagbhag sabhi ne lagaataar haar kaa aaropee sabit kar diya he
 Even his place in the team is not safe
 agar unhone aisa kiya he to yah unka rakshaatmak or banaavati cheharaa hi ujagar karata he
 In such a situation, he is blaming everyone, whether he is serious or Sehwag or batsman or bowler
 mohinder amarnath ne to yahaan tak kaha he ki dhoni se captaini lekar gambhir ko di jaani chahie
 'he said,' Dhoni feels that he will make everything suit himself
 aapane dekha eden kii pich ko lekar unhone kaisaa bakhera khadaa kiya?yah sabhi dekh rahe hai ki gambhir kaisaa khel rahe hai or ab is lalkaar ke baad wo kya karenge yah to nagpur test se hi pataa chal jayega
 Team India is going through one of its worst phase
 antim 16 test main se yah team 10 test haar chuki he or vartmaan siries main bhi 2-1 se peeche he
 In such a situation, this new round of accusation did not overwhelm Team India and after 27 years, England's team will not be able to win Test series in India
 to vakt he sabhi khilaadiyon kaa aapasi katutaa ko kam kar ekajute ho khilne kaa
 However, in the meantime, it has also been reported that Mahendra Singh Dhoni has denied the complaint made to BCCI about Gambhir and has declared the news as false

 In Lucknow, due to different religions, new facts are coming in the case of not giving passport
 pehle ye kaha gaya ki hindu-muslim kapal hone ke chalate mohammad anas siddiki or tanvi seth ko passport adhikari ne dharm ke naam par apamaanit kiya
 Being a hindu-muslim, his application for passport renewal was rejected and the passport was put on hold
 lekin ab jo tathy saamne aae hai, uske mutabik, passport adhikari ne teen visangatiyon ke chalate aapatti jaahir kii thi
 The BJP has also jumped into this controversy
 bijepi ne kaha ki agar passport adhikari doshi he to us par karrwai ho
 And now there are also reports that after the controversy over the name and permanent address of Tanvi Seth, the whole matter can be investigated once again
 passport vivaad ke tool pakadaney ke baad bhale hi aanan-fanan main tanvi seth kaa passport unhen de diya gaya ho, lekin ek baar phir passport kaa veriphication kiya ja saktaa he
 It is reported that Tanvi Seth's passport may also be confiscated if passport verification is found to be wrong
 haalanki baad main is maamle ne itnaa tool pakadaa ki na sirf hindu-muslim kapal ko passport jari kar diya gaya, balki unke saath kathith taur par badasluki karne vaale passport adhikari kaa bhi transfar kar diya gaya
 Later, the accused passport officer also said, 'we have no meaning with religion, we have to take a decision according to the passport manual, in which the information given by the applicant has to be confirmed column wise
 us faisle ke tahat nivedak ko apana naam spasht karnaa chahie tha kyonki us par unka purana naam tha
 In fact, the passport officer had objected to these three discrepancies: - Job in Noida, Work from Lucknow, Passport objected to the address of Homanvi Seth, because Tanvi Seth has been working in a Noida company for 12 years
 , While to show the resident of Lucknow, he had given information about work from home
 aaropee passport adhikari ne isi baat par pehali aapatti jataai thi ki jab tanvinoida kii rahane valihain to unhen gajiabad se passport ke liye applai karnaa chahie
 Then how can someone work for 12 years while working in Noida through work from home from Lucknow

 narottam mishra ne kaha ki 'jyotiraditya sindhiya ne sarkaar ko aainaa dikhaane kaa kaam kiya he
 The government, which was based on lies and made up by lies, spread the illusion of farm loan waiver by signing on file on the first day
 jabaki unke rashtriya adhyaksh ne kaha tha ki 10 din main kisaan kaa karj maaf nahin hoga to mukhyamantri badal denge
 This means that Rahul Gandhi lied to the farmers
 narottam mishra ne kaha ki 'main pehle din se kah rahaa hum ki inhone kisi ek kaa bhi do lakh kaa karz maaf kiya ho to main do lakh duungaa

 — Lalit Kumar Modi (@lalitkmodi)january 22, 2015 On the occasion of jashn-e-azadi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal once again raised the issue of Delhi's independence
 mauka tha chhatrasaal stadium main yojit dilli sarkaar ke swatantraaa diwas kaarykram ke aayojan kaa
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, after hoisting the flag, took the salute of the parade and did not miss out on attacking the central government on the pretext of the address
 dilli waalon ke vot kii keemat kamakejariwal nepradhanmantri narendra modika naam liye bagaiyr ishaare-ishaare main dilli kii sanvaidhanik sthiti or purna rajya kii maang ek baar phir uthaai
 Kejriwal said that the system which is inside Delhi today is the same English system, in which you can choose your MLA and Chief Minister, but those representatives do not have the right to run the government
 sarkaar to koi or chalaata he
 Targeting the central government, Kejriwal asked from the platform of Independence Day why the cost of the vote of the people of Delhi is less than the cost of the vote of the people of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra? If the price of votes of people in states like Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Gujarat is 100 points, then the vote value of Delhi people is less than 20 points
 dilli main angrejon vaali vyavasthounhone kaha ki kya dilli ke log desh ke duusare rajyon se kam tex dete hai? kya dilli vaale kam deshbhakt hai? agar nahin to vot kii takat kam kyon? aakhir kyon dilli kii sarkaar ko puraa adhikaar nahin
 Delhi today has a British system where the elected representative of the people has no right, and like the British, the central government rules in Delhi
 ajukeshan riform ke liye kaam kiyakendre ko nishane par lene ke baad siem ne apni sarkaar ke kaamon kaa bhi jamkar bakhaan kiya or daawa kiya kii dilli kii sarkaar ke kaamon kii charchaa desh hi nahin america, europe or china tak ho rahi he
 Kejriwal said that whatever work we have done in the field of education, health and skill, he is the model for the world today
 jitna kaam hamane dedh saal main ajukeshan riform ke liye kiya wo apane aap main krantikari he
 We organized PTM (parent-teacher Meeting) in government schools for the first time
 uski charchaa bhi khub hui
 Carefully done, not only the center but also the concept of Mohalla clinic was very much liked by the people of Delhi
 dilli sarkaar kaa focus ajukeshan or health sector par he
 We will continue to work, no matter how many obstacles come
 ye pehla mauka nahin he jab swatantraaa diwas samaaroh ke manch par siem ne centre sarkaar ko kosa ho
 Even before this, Kejriwal has sometimes attacked the Center on the issue of police or rights
 lekin sidhi-sidhi khari-khoti sunaane vaale kejariwal is baar centre par hamalaa karte samay jaraa sanbhalkar bolte hue najar aae

 Another interesting thing is that even if it rains during PM Modi's speech, he will not put an umbrella
 khatmahogyojna ayogmodi ne kaha, desh main aisi vyavastha kaa vikaas karnaa meraa sapana he, jiske baad yojana ayog kii jarurat nahin rah jaaegi
 For this, we have to work together
 modi ne kaha, ham bahut jaldi desh main yojana ayog kii jagah nai soch or nae vishwaas ke saath nai sanstha kaa nirmaan karenge
 In Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK has made a spectacular comeback by defeating rival DMK in the assembly elections and won an absolute majority in the state assembly on its own
 tamilnadu ne vijeta ko sab kuch saunp dene kii apni pratishtha barkaraar rakhte hue jayalalita ko shandaar tareeke se satta ke galiyaaron tak waapas pahunchaaya
 Their alliance has won more than 200 seats in the 234-member assembly
 annadramuk ne rajya main 160 siton par kismat aajamaai thi or 147 par jeet hasil kii he vahiin teen par badhat banaae hue he
 In this way, the party has surpassed the magical figure of 117 in the 234-member assembly
 shrirangam se 41 hajaar se adhik maton se jeet hasil karne vaali jayalalita ne ise logon kii dramuk sarkaar ke khilaaf naaraazgi kaa nateeja bataaya
 At the same time, 87-year-old Chief Minister m Karunanidhi accepted the defeat and submitted his cabinet resignation to the Governor and said that he has got rest from the right
 dramuk ne 121 siton par kismat aajamaai or 19 par jeet hasil kii vahiin isaki pramukh sahyogi congress kii sthiti bhi acchhee nahin he or sambhavat: pehla mauka hoga jab pradesh main uske vidhayakon kii sankhya paanch par simat gai he
 Several leaders of the DMK, Congress and PMK are lagging behind in the counting of votes
 sansmaran kii sabase badi khaasiyat yah he ki vah ateet ke daravaaje kholte hue vartmaan ko prabhavit karnaa chaahati he
 In that too, if the memoir is of a writer whose works have left a strong mark on world literature, then its importance increases even more
 sansmaran kii ek aisi hi kitaab gustav jainuk kii he, jinhone franj kafka se hui mulakaaton kii baatcheet ko likhaa he
 The book is titled 'memoirs of Kafka'
 is kitaab kaa hindi anuwaad vallabh siddharth ne kiya he
 The specialty of this book is that you get a chance to know a lot about them without reading Kafka's compositions
 is kitaab main kafka kii baatcheet lekhak se zyada ek darshanashastri kii tarah he, jo apni har baat par aapako sochane ke liye vivash karata he
 Read the important lines of this book: 'how many times there is no injustice in the name of justice, sin is not raised by raising the flag of virtue, Fall is not presented as an uplift? Now it is clearly visible that the war has not only burned and wired this world, it has also ignited it
 ham dekh rahe hai ki yah manushya kaa manushya ke liye buna gaya jaal he
 The world of snow-mechanized humans, whose opacity and motive constantly weaken and humiliate us
 '' maranaa ek maanviya prakriya he, isaliye manushya marate hai, lekin bandar samoochee maanav jati main jivit rahata he
 
 
 
 
 
 yah ateet se praapt ek kathghare ke alaava kuch nahin, jisamen bhavishya kii sapanili salakhen judi hui hai
 "I am not an Eskimon, but like the majority of people today, i too live in extreme cold
 jabaki hamaare paas na to eskimon jaise roendaar poshaak hai, na un jaise jeene ke duusare saadhan
 We are bare compared to them
 aaj kii duniya main garm ve hi hai, jo bhedon kii khaal main hai
 "truth which is one of the few priceless things in life cannot be bought
" prem or saundarya kii tarah sach bhi manushya ko ek bhent ke rup main miltaa he magar akhbaar ek jins he, jise kharida or bechaa ja saktaa he
 ' pichley kai dashakon main sabase adhik yuva sphurti va armaanon se chuni sarkaar apane nirdhaarit samay se kareeb do saal peeche chal rahi he
 The budget that Arun Jaitley presented in February 2016 should have come in July 2014, when the government came to power and the first signs of the crisis in the rural economy were showing
 alabatta us daur main to narendra modi sarkaar kisaanon ko yah samajhane kii jid thaane baithi thi ki bhoomi adhigrahan unke liye sukh, vaibhav va samruddhi lekar aane vaala he
 Therefore, the BJP waited for its tail to be cut in Bihar, wasted three crops and deepened crisis in the rural economy and focused its third budget on the basic challenges of the economy
 baharhaal, yah ank jab tak haath main hoga, tab tak desh, modi sarkaar ke is let-latif bajet ko pachaa chukaa hoga
 The country is always faster than the governments, so it would be better to see what the budget was really looking for in 2016 and how much hope is there to do something
 behad vipareet maahaul main bhi jidipi ko saat fisadi se upar rakhane vaale suurama talashne hon to vah aapako mumbai, dilli ke shandaar korporate daftaron main nahin balki apane aasapaas ke bazaar main mil jaaenge jo hotel se lekar repering tak choti-choti darjanon sevaayen va suvidhaayen dekar hamaari jindagi ko aasaan karte hai
 This is the third force of India which has changed the DNA of the Indian economy, giving the basis of growth and employment in the midst of recession
 modi sarkaar kii ungali agar nabj par hoti, to 2016 ke bajet main kheti kii galati sudhaarney ke saath seva kshetra ko bhavishya kii ummiido kaa centre bananaa chahie tha
 Agriculture and industry (manufacturing) now account for only 34 per cent of the economy
 samgr aarthik utpaadan main 66 fisadi seva kshetra kaa he, jisamen desh kaa vishaal khudara va thok vyapaar, hotel va restaraan, transport, sanchaar, storage, vittiya sevaayen, kaarobaari sevaayen, bhawan nirmaan va usase judi sevaayen, saamaajik sevaayen or saamudayik sevaayen aati hai
 The 2015 Economic Review states that the services sector now has growth in revenue, employment, foreign investment and exports from India
 bharat main jab bade udyogon or krishi ne nivesh se kinaaraa kar liya he, tab keval seva kshetra he jisamen vailu adishan ho rahaa he
 Value addition is an economic measure that proves how much new investment is coming in which economic sector
 kendriya sankhyikee vibhaag ne haal main hi vailu adishan ke aankade jari kiye hai, jinke mutabik, 2014-15 main seva kshetra main sakal vailu adishan kii growth dar 7
 10 to 8 per cent
 3 fisadi ho gai
 According to the Economic Review, the pace of growth in general capital investment in the country during 2014-15 is only 5
 6 fisadi thi, tab services main yah 8
 Grew at a rate of 7 percent
 arthath agar bharat main vishaal seva kshetra kaa ingine na chal rahaa hota to shaayad ham behad buree haalat main hote
 This is the reason why the services sector is the top among the sectors attracting foreign investment in India
 aarthik samiksha ke aankade bataate hai ki 2014-15 main seva kshetra kii das sheersh sevaaon main videshi nivesh 70
 Rose 4 percent
 yah raftaar 2015-16 main jari rahi he
 The growth of services came from the basic and traditional segments of the Indian market
 pichley saal trade, repering, hotel or restaraan, profeshnal sarvice, transport main 8 se 11
 Growth was seen by 5 percent
 desh ke 21 rajyon ke sakal gharelu utpaadan main 40 fisadi hissaa sevaaon kaa he
 In states where industrial investment is limited, the building of the state's economy rests on services
 agar in sevaaon main growth na hoti to shaayad centre se zyada buree haalat rajyon kii hoti jinke paas rajasav ke strot behad simit hai
 If we look at the prospects of employment, consumption, urbanization and growth, then the Indian economy has changed its course
 is badlaav kii roshni main bajet kuch asangat lagate hai
 This is the reason why even after two years of effort, Make in India ie manufacturing did not catch pace whereas the government did not pay attention where there was momentum
 ulate sabase teji se viksit hote services kshetra par karon kaa boj ab sabase zyada he
 This mistake in the preferences of the government and the budget is probably because we could not change the old ways of measuring growth
 sabase aadhunik or vyaavhaarik paimaana rojgaar main kami yaa badhotaree ko naapnaa he
 The second major indicator of growth or recession is the decrease in consumption
 america main tarakkee ko naapane ke liye share bazaaron or visheshgyon kii nigaah jidipi ke jatil aankadon par nahin balki har maheene aane vaale rojgaar or khapat ke aankadon par hoti he
 The way to measure growth through employment is even better for a country like India, where the huge young population is roaming around checking for a so-called demographic dividend, which no one is willing to cash in on
 agar sarkaar growth ko naapane ke tareekon kii nai roshni main bharat ke taaja aarthik badlaav ko dekhati to shaayad ham bajaton ko zyada vyaavhaarik, samayik va aarthik hakeekat ke kareeb pate
 On this scale, the 2014 budget should have been for agriculture, while the 2015 budget could have focused on select industries where there is growth and employment, rather than slogans like Make in India, and this budget would have focused on the services sector that India Is a stronghold of new entrepreneurship and needs incentives and facilities, not new taxes
 2016 kaa bajet bataata he ki do saal kii udaan ke baad, der se hi sahi, sarkaar hakeekat kii jameen par utar ai he, haalanki do behad keemtee bajet ganvaae ja chuke hai lekin phir bhi bade badlaavon kii shuruyaat kabhi bhi kii ja sakati he
 69 years ago, on 26 November 1949, the government adopted the Constitution of India, which was implemented on 26 January 1950 with the system of democratic government
 samvidhan ke mulyon, manyataon or paramparaon kii wo pavitra kitaab he jiske ek ek shabd main ham bharat ke log apane liye surakshit vartmaan or sunaharaa bhavishya dhundhate hai
 Let us know the special things related to this: - It took the Constitution all of 2 years, 11 months and 17 days to complete this historic task of drafting the Constitution
 - samvidhan kii khaas baat ye he ki adhikaar or kartavya yani 'rights and Duites' ke bare main vistaar se varnan kiya gaya he
 - Dr
 talking about the Constituent Assembly
 baba ambedkar kaa yogadan kabhi nahin bhulaayaa ja saktaa jo samvidhan sabha ke centre main rahe
 He is known as the architect of the Constitution of India
 jaane- koun the sar choturam, kyon kaha jaataa he unhen 'kisaanon ke maseehaa'- bataa den, samvidhan sabha ke sadsy bharat ke rajyon kii sabhaaon ke nirvaachit sadasyon ke dwaara chune gaye the
 Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad etc
 were prominent members of this gathering
 - masauda likhane vaali samiti ne samvidhan hindi, angreji main haath se likhakar kallingraph kiya tha or isamen koi typing yaa printing shaamil nahin thi
 - The world's largest constitution with 448 articles, 12 schedules, 5 appendices and 100 amendments
 - samvidhan sabha ke 284 sadasyon ne 24 janvari 1950 ko dastavej par hastakshar kiye
 It was implemented two days later
 
 
 
 When Indira was called a 'dumb doll', Pakistan's geography was amended in the Constitution
 
 
 sanshodhan ke prastaav kii shuruyaat sansad main hoti he jahaan ise ek bill ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he
 It must then be approved by each House of Parliament
 prayek sadan main (1) ise upasthit saansadon kaa do tihaai bahumat or matdaan praapt hona chahie or (2) sabhi sadasyon (upasthit yaa anupasthit) kaa saadhaaran bahumat praapt hona chahie
 Subsequently, specific amendments must also be approved by at least half of the state legislatures
 ek baar jab sabhi anya avasthaaen puri kar lee jaati hai, sanshodhan ke liye bharat ke raashtrapati kii sweekruti praapt kii jaati he, parantu yah antim pravastha keval ek aupchaarikta hi he

 Here the BSP got 1,499 and Independents 794 and three other candidates like Gujarat Jan Chetna Party, Naveen Bharat Nirman Manch, Indian New Congress Party got nearly three thousand votes
 aisa hi rujhaan mahuwa, chansma, disa or dabhoi jaise vidhansabha seat par bhi rahaa

 saath hi eisisi main bhi bataur mahasachiv do baar wo jagah paa chuke hai
 According to sources, Gehlot will soon meet Rahul again by preparing the full details of his 7-point plan to strengthen the Congress organization
 uske baad plan par jamini kaam shuru kar diya jayega
 There is talk of tightening the nuts and bolts at every level in the organization from the booth to the Congress organization's plan of recovery
 1
 State, district and booth committees should be set by setting deadlines across the country
 iske liye party ke pradeshon mahasachivon or pradesh adhyakshon ko jaldi hi nirdesh jari kar die jaaenge
 2
 sabhi cametiyon main jagah paane waalon kaa ek data bank bhi taiyaar kiya jayega
 It will also have information on their details, background and expertise
 iske jariye vyakti kii visheshta dekhakar jarurat padane par uskaa istemaal kiya jaayegaa yaa koi pad diya jaayegaa
 3
 party sanghathan main har str par 5 virgon ko kam se kam kul 50 fisadi sthaan diya jaayegaa
 These classes will include scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, backward classes, women and minorities
 4
 How the programs delivered from the Central Congress will be monitored at all levels
 saath hi apane jile, booth yaa pradesh str ke muddon par khud sanghathan ne kya kiya, isaki bhi monitering hogi
 5
 monitering gambheertha se ho iske liye sabko paper kating or video cliping bhi taiyaar rakhni hogi
 For monitoring itself, Rahul Gandhi has formulated a formula to appoint 4 in-charge secretaries with one in-charge in each state
 6
 At every level, training programs and conferences have to be organized within the stipulated time
 inamen visheshgyon, jaankaron or netaaon ke lacture bhi honge
 This work will also be monitored
 7
 It has been decided that Rahul himself will hold a meeting with the in-charge of the state and the four in-charge secretaries every four months to review this entire exercise to strengthen the organization
 haalanki siyaasi jarurat ke hisaab se kabhi bhi ye mulaakaat ho sakati he
 According to sources, Rahul has clear instructions to Gehlot that after monitoring, accountability should be fixed
 behatar pradarshan karne waalon ko inaam or kharaab pradarshan karne waalon ko sajaa kaa niyam kadai se amal main laayaa jayega
 At the same time, the policy of zero tolerance on mutual disunity and indiscipline in the party will be followed
 iske alaava party sanghathan main padon par baithe 40 fisadi log hi ripet honge or 60 fisadi nae chehre honge
 These new people will be especially those who have been in the party for a long time, but are not in positions
 saath hi party main aae kuch nae logon ko bhi mauka diya ja saktaa he
 Rahul has already instructed the state presidents and general secretaries that 40 percent of the placements in the appointment of PCC delegates and AICC members should be given to people below 40 years
 apane nae formule par baat karte hue ashok gahalot ne kaha ‘ji haa, rahul ji ne sanghathan kii durustagi ke liye kai nae nirdesh die hai, jinka paalan hoga
 Also, everyone's accountability will definitely be fixed
 ’ gahalot ne puure vishwaas ke saath kaha ki indira, rajeev or sonia kii tarah hi rahul bhi congress ko aage lekar jaaenge
 The squeeze of all the trouble is that Rahul is preparing to enter the political battle by giving a new edge to the party organization
 lekin bada sawaal ye he ki kaagaj par jo ranneeti he wo jameen par kitni majbootee or gambhirtha se utaari jaati he
 Even during the Youth Congress and NSUI, many of Rahul's paper projects were not successful on the ground
 unka congress main party tikat hasil karne ke liye primary karaani kaa payalat project bhi paravaan nahin chadh sakaa tha
 However, after getting the ground and Majha warlords like Gehlot, how successful is the plan to revive the Congress organization, it will tell only the time to come
 diwali par ayodhya main bade jashn kii taiyaari he
 The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh will be in Ayodhya, which he announced several days ago

 He revealed this to Khalid, he expected Khalid to be as happy as he is
 lekin, khalid ke jawaab ne uskaa dil tod diya
 Khalid's answer was that he had nothing to do, neither with him nor with the child in his womb
 tiraskrit hone baad wo yuvati apane bhattije ke saath punjab ke jalandhar chali ai
 Here, he secretly got the unborn baby down
 lekin wo waapas lauti ek pratishodh ke saath ki us vyakti ko khatm kar dena he

 For the last eight years, he had survived bullets from the security forces

 Khalid worked for Pakistan in the Kashmir Valley

 However, Khalid retained his Lover Boy image

 soochna ke baad police kii team spot par pahunchi or ilaake ko gher liya
 By that time it was too late

 a team of security forces then waited for Khalid to enter Sopore

 As soon as he felt the need to be surrounded, he started firing
 lekin, special oparation group (esaoji) kii team ne uskaa kaam tamaam kar diya
 The firing lasted only four minutes

 noida main aavantit kii gai kareeb deb sau farm house kii jameen ke maamle main bada ghotaalaa saamne aayaa he
 Now the UP government has ordered an inquiry into it
 is jaanch kii report ko ek hapte main saunpa jayega
 The matter is about Mangrauli village of Noida
 teen saal pehle tak is gaanv kheton main kisaan chamanlal kii jaminen thi or fasal laharaati thi
 But in 2009, the government took these farms into its possession without giving notice
 baad main yah zamin farm house banane ke liye kodiyon ke daam de di gai
 Chamanlal has not received compensation for the land till date
 ab chamanlal khush hai ki ab is maamle kii jaanch hogi
 Eminent lawyer Shanti Bhushan and his son Jayant Bhushan were given two plots of 10,000 square meters to build a farm house on the land of this village
 shanti bhushan ne enditivi se kaha ki galati sarkaar kii he agar alotment cancil hote hai to wo iske liye taiyaar hai
 But the farmers say they have been cheated
 mayawati kii sarkaar ne 2009 main yamuna ke aasapaas kareeb 12 gaanvon kii zamin immergency close lagaakar adhigrahit kii or phir use 150 farm house ke liye alott kar diya
 This land was given to 29 people and 120 companies to build agricultural farm houses
 jaankaree ke mutabik kisaanon ko zamin ke badale main 1100 rupee prati vagarmetre dene kaa vaada kiya gaya
 But for the farm house, this land was sold at the rate of Rs 3100 per square meter
 jabaki us samay aasapaas kii kaarobaari zamin 4 xxrep 4 0 rupee vagarmetre thi
 The comments shuruaati jaanch main pataa chalaa ki isse sarkari khazaane ko takreeban 150 karod kaa chuunaa laga
 Some of these farm houses are under construction and some are currently vacant
 kaayade se farm houseon main sirf 10 fisadi consatruction kiya ja saktaa tha baaki kheti ke liye khaali rahani chahie
 But seeing the farm house, it is clear that they have nothing to do with farming
 baat noida ke mangarauli gaanv kii he
 Till three years ago, this village had the lands of farmer Chamanlal in the fields and waving crops
 lekin 2009 main sarkaar ne bina notice diye in kheton ko apane adhikaar main le liya
 Later this land was given the cost of a penny to build a farm house
 zamin kaa muawza chamanlal ko aaj tak nahin mila
 Now Chamanlal is happy that the matter will now be investigated
 jane−maane vakil shanti bhushan or unke bete jayant bhushan ko isi gaanv kii zamin par farm house banane ke liye 10hajaar vagarmetre ke do plot diye gayi
 Shanti Bhushan told NDTV that the mistake is that of the government, if the allotments are canceled then they are ready for it
 lekin kisaan kehete hai ki unke saath dhokhadhadi hui he
 In 2009, Mayawati's government acquired land for about 12 villages around Yamuna by imposing emergency clauses and then allotted it to 150 farm houses

 com / c4ufvw7ing Mamta's rail will proceed on the agenda of Lalu's interim budget or take a U-turn
 yah sawaal rajpath se janpath tak poocha ja rahaa he
 We will have to wait for the budget for the answer, but at the moment it can be said that like Lalu, Mamta's rail will have to carry the burden of vote bank
 bengal par ho sakati he tohfon kii barsatlalu ke kulhad ke din ab lad sakate he
 Mishti doi can replace buttermilk and the attitude of trains can now be Bengal instead of Bihar
 mamata ke garh pashchim bengal me chunaav hone he isliye rail bajet main kuch baaten kamobesh tay maani ja rahi he
 There is little scope for increase in passenger fares
 aise main mumkin he ki maal dhulaai kii daron ko badha kar aamadani badhaane kii koshish kii jaae
 Just a few months ago, Lalu Prasad Yadav presented the Interim Rail Budget in this manner
 ekadam loklubhaavan or riyaayaton se bharaa bajet
 No increase or no cut anywhere
 lekin logon kaa kahana he ki lalu ji ne ek haath se diya or donon haathon se le liya
 Some surcharges hit the passengers only in the name of penalty
 lalu ke kai faisle badale gaelekin ab jab rail kaa control mamata banerjee ke haath main aa gaya he to mana ja rahaa he ki didi rail nitiyon kii patari par you turn maarengi
 Didi has already reversed many of Lalu's decisions
 pehle purv rail mantri teen sahayakon ke saath asi first class main safar kar sakate the lekin ab nahi
 Mamta also removed many railway halts built during Lalu's tenure
 ab jab lalu ji sarkaar se koson dur he aise main mamata ke liye kai or faislon ko badalane main koi hichak nahi hogi
