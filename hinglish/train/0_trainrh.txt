 bhaajapa or shivasena ne loksabhaa chunaav kaa prachaar aaj maharashtra ke vidarbha se shuru kar diya he
 For this publicity meeting, big leaders of both the party gathered in Amravati on Friday
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye aapasi matbhed ko dur karne ke liye amravati main bhaajapa or shivasena kaaryakartao kaa sammelan yojit kiya gaya
 Where, for the first time after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Shiv Sena and senior BJP leaders were seen praising each other from the same platform
 donon paksh ke kaaryakartaaon ke bich kii dooriyaan mitaane or kaaryakarta chunaav prachaar main ek saath mehnat karen isliye hi donon paksh ek duusare par shabdon ke phool barasaate najar aae
 While Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, in his speech, counted the development work done by the central government in five years, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said that since the last 15-20 days, there has been an alliance
 samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ki kya baat karun kaise baat karun kyonki abtak donon ke partiyon ke bich bahut sangharsh hua he
 Significantly, a few days ago, Uddhav Thackeray had said in the Pandharpur meeting that the watchman is a thief
 shuukravaar ko amravati main unhone bijepi or modi sarkaar kii tikhi aalochana karne kaa kaaran bataaya
 Uddhav said that in the last four and a half years we both criticized each other's party a lot
 uddhav ne kaha ke bhale hi donon ke man main kadavaahat nahin thi lekin donon ne ek duusare ke khilaaf shabdon kii talwaar uthaai thi
 Now the time has come to remove the sword from the sheath and the resentment in the mind should also be removed
 chunaav prachaar or kaaryakarta sammelan main uddhav ne kaha ki "donon ne ek duusare ke khilaaf jo bhi baaten kii thi wo public ke saamne kii thi
 In 25 years of alliance and now in four and a half years, there has been conflict or friendship ever since, but one thing is good that both of us never made the conflict between each other a hindrance in the development of the state
 "donon party ke kaaryakartoon ke bich dooriyaan mitaane or manomilan karaane ke liye uddhav thakare ne chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kii misaal di or kaha ki hindutv kii raksha karne ke magasad se ham saath aae hai
 Work will also have to be done together
 sirf chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kii jai bolne se or bhagava jhanda haath main lekar narebaaji karne se donon pakshon main gathbandhan nahin hoga
 Giving the example of Chhatrapati Shivji Maharaj, Uddhav Thackeray said that if he had seen Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in front of him and bitterness behind his back, he would have taught us to push all of us from the hill
 uddhav thakare ye kehane se bhi nahin chuke ki agar bhaajapa or shivasena kii gathbandhan nahin hui hoti to 2019 ke chunaav main ham haar gaye hote or agar haar hui hoti to koun satta main aayaa hota iskaa andaja kaaryakartaaon ko lagane ko kaha
 Taunting the BJP and the Chief Minister, reminding them of 2014, Uddhav said that now do not take help of Sharad Pawar, do not take him in the party, because there is someone in the opposition whom we can criticize
 devendra fadanvis ne ensipi adhyaksh sharad pavaar kaa naam liye bagaiyr hi kaha ki ek party ke captain ne pehle elaan kiya ke wo chunaav ladane vaale hai
 a few days later, the same captain said that he will not contest the 2019 elections
 fadanvis ne kaha ki modi ji hardam kehete hai ki sharad pavaar ji hawa kaa rukh pahchaan lete hai
 Taking a dig at the Congress, he said that Ashok Chauhan has learned where the electoral wind is going in the state
 unki haar nishchit he or isiilie unhone chunaav nahin ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 The supporters of both the parties came in large numbers from five districts during the campaigning in Vidarbha, the launch of the election campaign held in Amravati and the activist conference

 Watch the controversial video below: china ke shiksha mantralay ne sabhi ucch shaikshanik sansthaanon ko is saal se ‘sex or prem’ paathyakram anivaary karne ke aadesh diye hai
 The special thing is that it seems that not all students are enthusiastic about it and some say that it is very monotonous
 manovaigyanik paathyakram ko sitambar se vishvavidhyalay chaatro ke liye anivaary kiya jayega jisamen ‘sex or prem’ bhi shaamil he
 a senior official of the ministry told the official 'china Daily' that in June this year, the ministry asked to prepare a compulsory mental health curriculum for students of all disciplines of universities across the country
 unhone kaha, ‘darasal is tarah ke kalege paathyakram kai varshon se taiyaar hai lekin ve mukhya rup se vaikalpik paathyakram hai
 The official said that the ministry has decided to make the courses compulsory because most university students have been advised to take help of psychological guidelines due to heavy pressure
 unhone kaha ki naye anivaary paathyakram ke saat bhaag honge
 In addition to sex and love, the course also has a study list on dealing with other psychological problems, including dealing with pressures and complications in life and studies
 mantralay ke is kadam ko lekar haalanki milijuli pratikriya mili he
 Gavo Chang, an 18-year-old student of medical science at Peking University, said that such courses are very popular among new students

 'some students, however, say that there is no reason to make it mandatory
 pratham varsh main manovaigyanik pathyakram lene vaaleen peking vishvavidhyalay kii chaatra wang kefai ne kaha ki yah bahut ubaau tha or isse unhen kuch bhi phayda nahin hua
 Fang, the male friend of this student, said, 'not all students need this kind of education
 vaise bhi ham vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr hai or hamamen se zyaadaatar sex or prem ke bare main jaanate hai

 Actually, the price of gold is setting a new record every day

 After 12 days on Monday, it reached the level of Rs 38 thousand 470
 lekin sawaal he ki gold kii keemat main itani badi teji kyon dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Let's know the answer
 
 1
 gold kii keemat main teji kii sabase badi vajah global raajnneetik sankat he
 Actually, the trade war between America and China is deepening globally
 haal hi main america kii ore se china kii vastuon par aayaat shulk laga diya gaya he
 According to the US, China is tampering with its currency yuan
 yahi vajah he ki america ne china kii yuan ko 'karency manipulator' qaraar diya he

 bataa den ki bharat sone kaa bahut bada ayatak he
 It imports more of its needs

 In the last few weeks, the Indian stock market's movement has been slow due to different reasons
 bazaar ke jaankaron ke mutabik is susti kii vajah se niveshak share bikwaali kar gold main nivesh par jor de rahe hai
 Explain that in the General Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a surcharge on foreign investment
 iske baad se share bazaar main jabardast giravat dekhne ko mili

 Due to the fall in inflation, the rate of new loan taken in 2019 is also likely to come down
 kul karzam sarkari karj wo karj he jisamen sarkari kshetra ( centre or rajya) kii dendariyon kaa samavesh hota he
 If we compare this debt to GDP ratio, then it is about 69 percent in FY 2019
 march 2016 main ye kareeb 68
 6 percent while the loan rate was 83 in 2003-04
 3% fisadi thi jo ab tak kii sabase zyada dar he
 Fiscal deficit 44 of GDP in March 2019
 5 fisadi tha jabaki 2018 main ye 45
 Was 6 percent
 sabase zyada rajkoshiya ghaataa march 2003 main tha jab ye 61
 The debt on the central government had reached 6 percent, usually the government takes loans from the market to meet its budget deficit
 isi tarah rajya sarkarein apana rajkoshiya ghaataa bhi bazaar se, vittiya agenciyon se or centre se karj leti he
 The expenditure of the state governments increases when they give money from their treasury for provident fund, reserve fund and all central schemes
 yahaan ye bataanaa bhi jaruri he ki kai viksit deshon kii arthvyavasthaaon main karj or jidipi anupaat bharat kii tulana main kahin zyada he
 However, due to the decrease in earnings, India's debt-to-income ratio appears to be higher in Triple b rating countries
 isliye reating agenciyon ke mutabik ye kaha ja saktaa he ki ye badi daren bharat ke vikaas kii raftaar par kabhi bhi brake laga sakati hai
 Today, the government's liability - slightly less than GDP
 sarkari kii dendaree hi pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh taur par 2019 ke bajet kaa rukh tay karegi
 Therefore, it can be clearly said that managing the fiscal deficit will be the biggest issue of this budget

 After about twenty years, the terrorist attack in Punjab kept everyone open
 kalai isliye agar aatanki apane napak mansoobey main kaamyaab ho jate to marane waalon kii taadaad kahin zyada hoti
 a total of nine people have died in this attack
 keval teen aatanki seemaa paar kar daakhil hue or unhen maarane main 11 ghante se zyada lage
 That too when the encounter was going on in an empty house
 muthbhed zyada der tak khinch jane par tark diya gaya ki police aatankiyon ko jinda pakadana chaahati thi lekin itane hi puraa punjab is bhayanak hamale se dahal uthaa
 Shocking was also natural as Punjab had almost forgotten the terrible days of terrorism in which thousands of people were killed
 tajjub tab or zyada hua jab desh ke grih mantri ne is oparation par na keval punjab police kii saraahna kii balki badhai bhi di
 The argument has been given that this message should be given worldwide that we are one on the issue of terrorism
 kisi ne bhi is karrwai kii samiksha karne kii jarurat nahin samajhi
 However, this attack was neither the first nor the last
 par isse kaise nipta gaya? kya aatankiyon se aise niptenge? ye koi guttham guttha kii ladaai to he nahin ki aamane saamne aakar faisla kar liya jaae
 If anyone has seen the video of the time of the encounter with the terrorists, then it will be known
 keval police ke SWAT commando ko chhod diya jaae to shaayad hi koi aatankiyon se ladane ke liye feet tha, na to shaareerik taur par, na hi maansik or na hi hathiyaar se
 Some Punjab Police jawans were daring the terrorists to come forward and fight
 jabaki wo khud na to bullate pruf jacket pahane the or na hi behatar tareeke se kavaap the
 The building in which the terrorists were hiding and firing was empty and the young men who were in it were killed by the terrorists
 ek aatanki ko shuru main hi maar diya gaya or doosraa grenade ke pin nikaalte vakt khud maaraa gaya
 Just one terrorist, he was injured and it took several hours to kill him
 punjab police ke jawan bullate pruf jacket pahanakar kyon nahin aatankiyon se lard rahe the, is bare main punjab police ke dijipi kehete hai 150 jacket gaadi main jaakhe the lekin ye punjab police ke jawan hai
 Now think for yourself whether it is their ignorance, stupid or non-professional attitude
 aapke saamne khadaa dushman eke-47 se fire kar kar rahaa he or keval thri note thri rifl, bina bullate pruf jacket ke sahare bahaduree dikhaa rahe hai
 Do not know now that the operation is over, then what is the harm in assuming that the Punjab Police did not have the weapons at that time that they would be able to compete with the terrorist
 yahi vajah rahi ki ye muthbhed itani lambii khinchi
 Although the Special Army personnel reached the army shortly after the attack, they were not used by the Punjab Police
 agar thodaa peeche jaaen to jab mumbai main bhi aatanki hamalaa hua tha to unke paas bhi na to aise prashikshit jawan the or na hi hathiyaar jo aatankiyon se muqabla kar pate
 Punjab is also a little untouched by this
 ho saktaa he is aatanki hamale ke baad sanbhal jaae or javaanon kii training or hathiyaar par dhyaan de, taaki wo phir har tarah se aatank kaa muqabla kar saken
 At the moment, it is only being speculated on what was the motive of the terrorists
 par ek baat jarur in andaajon se nikal kar aati thi ki seemaa par kii jane vaali tarbandi bhi aatankiyon kii ghuspaith ko roak nahin paa rahi he
 Though the BSF has been claiming that Parinda cannot be killed on the international border along Pakistan, but the terrorists coming from the river drains are blowing these claims from time to time
 har jagah baad nahin lagi hui he, khaskar jahaan par nadi or naale hai
 There are artificial artifacts to say, but they are not very effective
 jammu-pathankot rajmarg par police chaukiyon, vaahanon or sainik thikaanon par hue aatanki hamalon kii jaanch main ek hi baat saamne ai ki sabhi hamalavar hamaari suraksha kii khaamiyon kaa laabh uthaakar is ore ghuse the
 Like Jammu, the first BSF here was not ready to believe that terrorists entered through the international border
 baad main jab jeepies se khulaasa hua tab jaakar wo maane ki aatanki ibi se hokar punjab main aaye the
 The comments dhyaan rahe aatankiyon kii badakismati thi or gurdaspur ke log khudakismat rahen ki aatankiyon ke napak mansoobey kaamyaab nahin ho sake varanaa nuksaan isse kahin zyada hota
 If this danger is averted, its credit goes to the bus driver Nanakchand and the farmer Satpal
 nanakchand ne aatankiyon ke bas rukvane par bas nahin roki or bhaga le gaya
 In that situation, when he was fired on, despite this he did not get scared nor panicked, which saved the lives of 76 people sitting in the bus
 aise hi satpal ne railway trek par bam dekha or phir kisi tarah train rukvaai gai jisase 9 bheed bhaad bhare dabbe main baithe saikadon logon ko kharonch tak nahin ai
 The danger is not yet over
 punjab main hamalon kii shuruuaat karne vaali takaton ke liye punjab ek kamjor lakshya (soft target) sabit ho saktaa he
 In Punjab, the government of the government is there to stop the increasing steps of terrorism
 iske liye vahaan ke sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko bhi dalgat raajnneeti se upar uth kar dushman kii napak ranneeti kaa munhtod uttar dena hoga varanaa punjab bees saal pehle aatankwaad ke jis raste se mud kar vikaas ke raste par chalaa rahaa he vah phir do dashak pehle ke daur main jaakar khadaa ho jayega
 When the encounter was prolonged, it was argued that the police wanted to capture the terrorists alive, but the entire Punjab was shaken by this terrible attack
 dahalanaa swabhaavik bhi tha kyonki punjab aatankwaad ke un bhayanak dinon ko lagbhag bhula chukaa tha jisamen hajaaron log maut ke ghat utaar diye gayi the
 More surprisingly, the country's home minister not only praised the Punjab Police for this operation but also congratulated it
 tark ye diya gaya ki duniyabar main ye massej dena chahie ki ham aatankwaad ko mudde par ek hai
 Nobody thought it necessary to review this action
 vaise ye hamalaa na to pehla tha or na hi aakhri
 But how to deal with it? Will we deal with terrorists like this? It is not a battle of clutches that one should decide face to face
 agar kisi ne aatankiyon se muthbhed ke vakt kaa video dekha ho to iskaa andaja ho jaayegaa
 Leaving only the SWAT commandos of the police, hardly anyone was fit to fight the terrorists, neither physically, nor mentally, nor with weapons
 punjab police ke kuch jawan to aatankiyon ko lalkaar rahe the ki saamne aakar lado
 While he himself was neither wearing a bullet proof jacket nor a better coverup
 aatanki jis building main chhipakar firing kar kar rahe the wo khaali thi or usamen jo jawan the use aatankiyon ne maar diya tha
 One terrorist was killed initially and the other was killed while removing the grenade pin
 bas ek aatanki wo bhi ghayal phir use maarane main kai ghante lag gaye
 The Punjab Police DGP says about why the Punjab Police soldiers were not fighting the terrorists wearing bullet proof jackets, 150 jackets were seen in the car but they are Punjab Police personnel
 ab aap khud hi sochie ye unki naadaani he, bevakoofi he yaa phir gaiyr peshewar ravaiya
 The enemy standing in front of you is firing from the AK-47 and only three not three rifles are showing bravery with no bullet proof jacket
 pataa nahin ab jabaki oparation khatm ho gaya he to ye maanane main kya buraai he ki punjab police ke paas us vakt vaise hathiyaar nahin the jisase wo aatanki se muqabla kar pate
 That is why this encounter took so long
 haalanki hamalaa hone ke kuch der baad sena ke special force ke jawan pahunch gayi the lekin punjab police ne inkaa istemaal nahin kiya
 If you go back a little, when there was a terrorist attack in Mumbai too, then neither did they have such trained soldiers nor weapons who could compete with the terrorists
 punjab bhi isse achoota thodi he
 It may be possible after this terrorist attack and pay attention to the training and weapons of the soldiers, so that they can counter the terror in every way
 vaise philhal is par sirf andaaj hi lagaaya ja rahaa he ki aatankiyon kaa makasad kya tha
 But one thing definitely came out of these estimates that even the border restrictions are not able to stop the infiltration of terrorists
 yun to pakistan se lage international border par parinda bhi par nahin maar saktaa kaa daawa lagaataar biguef karti rahi he par nadi naalon ke raaston se aane vaale aatanki in daavon kii samay samay par dhajjiyaan jarur uda rahe hai
 There is no fencing everywhere, especially where there are rivers and streams
 kehane ko artiphisial abstekal (kritrim baadhaaen) jarur hai par wo zyada kargaar nahin hai
 In the investigation of terrorist attacks on police posts, vehicles and military bases on jammu-pathankot highway, one thing came out that all the attackers had taken advantage of our security flaws and entered this side
 jammu kii tarah yahaan pehle biguef ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin thi ki international border se hokar aatanki ghuse
 Later, when the GPS was revealed, he agreed that the terrorists had come to Punjab via IB
 tippaniyan Keep in mind that the terrorists were unfortunate and the people of Gurdaspur were unfortunate that the evil intentions of the terrorists could not succeed, otherwise the loss would have been much more
 ye khatra tala to iskaa credit bas driver nanakchand or kisaan satpal ko jaataa he
 Nanakchand did not stop the bus after the terrorists stopped the bus and drove away
 us halaat main jabaki us par fire hua, baavjood iske wo daraa nahin or naa hi ghabaraaya, jisase bas main baithe 76 logon kii jaan batch gai
 Similarly, Satpal saw a bomb on the railway track and then somehow the train was stopped so that hundreds of people sitting in 9 crowded boxes were not even scratched
 khatra abhi tala nahin he
 Punjab may prove to be a weak target for the forces launching attacks in Punjab
 punjab main aatankwaad ke phir badhate kadamon ko rokna vahaan kii sarkaar ke haath main he
 For this, all political parties will have to rise above party politics and give a befitting reply to the nefarious strategy of the enemy or else the path of terrorism which has been turning from twenty years ago to the path of development is again two decades ago

 At the moment, it is only being speculated on what was the motive of the terrorists

 In the investigation of terrorist attacks on police posts, vehicles and military bases on jammu-pathankot highway, one thing came out that all the attackers had taken advantage of our security flaws and entered this side
 jammu kii tarah yahaan pehle biguef ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin thi ki international border se hokar aatanki ghuse
 Later, when the GPS was revealed, he agreed that the terrorists had come to Punjab via IB
 tippaniyan Keep in mind that the terrorists were unfortunate and the people of Gurdaspur were unfortunate that the evil intentions of the terrorists could not succeed, otherwise the loss would have been much more
 ye khatra tala to iskaa credit bas driver nanakchand or kisaan satpal ko jaataa he
 Nanakchand did not stop the bus after the terrorists stopped the bus and drove away
 us halaat main jabaki us par fire hua, baavjood iske wo daraa nahin or naa hi ghabaraaya, jisase bas main baithe 76 logon kii jaan batch gai
 Similarly, Satpal saw a bomb on the railway track and then somehow the train was stopped so that hundreds of people sitting in 9 crowded boxes were not even scratched
 khatra abhi tala nahin he
 Punjab may prove to be a weak target for the forces launching attacks in Punjab
 punjab main aatankwaad ke phir badhate kadamon ko rokna vahaan kii sarkaar ke haath main he
 For this, all political parties will have to rise above party politics and give a befitting reply to the nefarious strategy of the enemy or else the path of terrorism which has been turning from twenty years ago to the path of development is again two decades ago
 i will go and stand up

 The voting for the 6th phase of Lok Sabha elections has been held
 19 may ko saatven or aakhri charan ke vot daale jaaenge
 On May 23, it will be known whether Narendra Modi will hold the post of Prime Minister or take some new reins
 chunaav prachaar shabaab par he
 From Narendra Modi to Rahul Gandhi, from Mamata Banerjee to Mayawati and Akhilesh to Priyanka Gandhi, no leader wants to leave a stone unturned
 jahaan ek ore bhaashanon main piem modi phir se endie ko bahumat milane kii baat kah rahe hai to duusari taraf mayawati, mamata banerjee or priyanka gandhi ne unke khilaaf morcha kholkar tension badhaai hui he
 The level at which you have reached between Mamta and Modi is not hidden from anyone
 mayawati ne jashodaben ko ghasitkar piem narendra modi par ab tak kaa sabase bada hamalaa kiya he
 Mayawati said that Modi left his wife due to political selfishness
 unhone kaha ki bijepi main vivaahit auraten modi se ghabraati hai
 At the same time, Priyanka Gandhi is trying to weaken the BJP and Modi factor in Uttar Pradesh
 somvaar priyanka gandhi madhya pradesh ke ujjain sthit mahakaleshwar mandir main darshan kiye or phir ratlam raily main piem modi par sawaalon kii bauchhaar
 If i say that apart from other opposition leaders, Modi's fight is different from these three men, then it will not be wrong
 uttar pradesh main bijepi ke saamne samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ke gathbandhan se ladane kii chunauti thi
 But Priyanka Gandhi suddenly increased her head by hitting an entry
 mamata banerjee aae din piem modi par nae hamale karti rahati hai
 Mamta feels that PM Modi is tarnishing Bengal and her image
 darasal mamata or modi sarkaar ke bhi talkhiyaan chunaav shuru hone se pehle hi bad gai thim
 BJP has high hopes from Bengal
 isliye modi or amit shah donon mamata ke garh main baar-baar jaakar unhen chunauti de rahe hai
 Apart from this, Mayawati, who has a separate place in up's politics, is also taking a dig at PM Modi's policies in almost every rally
 mayawati ne bhale hi sapa-basapa gathbandhan main congress kii entry nahin hone di lekin aise bayanon se vah congress kaa balldor se puri tarah saath de rahi hai
 In the election campaign, PM Modi had shown sympathy to Mayawati and said that Akhilesh and Congress are cheating on him
 lekin sendhamari kii koshish se mayawati is kadar bhadakengi ye andaja shaayad unhen nahin rahaa hoga
 Now it is Priyanka Gandhi who, like brother Rahul Gandhi, is resorting to soft Hindutva
 jhaansi se siddheshwar mandir se lekar kaashi vishwanath mandir main bhi vah darshan or puja-archana kar chuki hai
 After worshiping at the Ujjain Mahakal temple, he said in Ratlam that PM Modi calls himself a sannyasi, so why not take care of poor farmers and unemployed
 40 minute tak vah mahakaal mandir main raheen or puri tarah shivbhakti main leen najar ain
 In her speeches, she keeps taunting Narendra Modi over demonetisation, GST, unemployment and farmers
 ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki 23 may ko narendra modi kaa palada baari rahata he yaa ye teen mardaaniyaan baaji maar le jaaengi

 The battle for supremacy between CM yogi-keshav Prasad Maurya is playing against each other, the game of cheating was sparked with the return to power in 2017, everything did not go well between Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya
 Used to be
 haal hi ke ghatnakram par najar daalen to upi sarkaar ke sheersh netritv ke do shikhar ek-duusare ke khilaaf aasteen chadaaye najar aate hai
 Though reports of estrangement between Yogi and Maurya were coming in the corridors of power and media since he assumed power, but now the matter has become a little serious
 haalat ye ho gai he ki chaahe yogi hon yaa maury donon ek-duusare ke adhinsth vibhaagon kii gadabadiyon par sakriyata dikhaakar khud ko bees sabit karne par tule najar aate hai
 It is worth mentioning that in 2019, CM Yogi Adityanath directed to examine the tenders and major construction works done in the last 2 years by the PWD department of Keshav Prasad Maurya
 ye theke or nirmaan kaary kareeb do hajaar karod rupee ke hai
 CM Yogi suspects that the PWD department is rigged in contracts and construction work
 sandesh ye gaya ki yogi iske jariye keshav prasad maury par nakel kase rakhana chaahate hai
 An angry Keshav Maurya wrote a letter to the Chief Minister about corruption and bribery spread in the LDA under his leadership after the order of accused Adityanath on the officers of the department under CM
 keshav maury ne apni chitthee main ld ke kai afasaron par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ye bhrashtachar main lipt hai or inaki jaanch kii jaani chahie
 Interestingly, Keshav Maurya's 'confidential' letter was leaked to the media
 isse mukhyamantri ke adheen vaale ld main karpshan kii baat saarvajanik ho gai
 This was seen as Maurya's response to Yogi's action
 yogi ne lee thi maury ke adheen vibhaag ke adhikariyon kii classktober main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne peedblyoody kii road mentanence unit kii ek rivyuu baithak kii
 Keshav Prasad Maurya was not involved in this
 is meeting main yogi adityanath ne uttar pradesh main sadakon kii badtar haalat or unke rakrakhaav ko lekar adhikariyon kii class lagaai or sadak ke gadde bharne kii taarikh pandrah november tak tay kar di
 According to official sources, Yogi Adityanath was so angry at this meeting that he also ordered the Principal Secretary PWD to lodge an FIR against those who are not doing the work of repairing and constructing the roads despite having funds in the districts
 isi meeting main yogi adityanath ne peedblyoody, shahari vikaas or sinchai vibhaag ke 2 saal ke sabhi kaaryon kii jaanch ke bhi aadesh die
 In response, Keshav Prasad Maurya wrote a letter to Yogi Adityanath about corruption spread in the LDA department on November 13 after the Keshav boiled 'letter bomb' Yogi and demanded a probe
 isamen mukhya rup se apartment ke construction or bhrashtachar ke tamaam maamalon kaa zikr kiya gaya tha
 In which Keshav Maurya had clearly alleged that the LDA has put the rules on hold to benefit the private builders
 keshav maury ne apni chitthee main parijaat, panchasheel, smriti, sristi or sahaj apartments ke construction par sawaal uthaate hue kaha tha ki aakhirkaar in logon ko blike list kyon nahin kiya gaya
 Construction work has been allotted to companies that are only 9 days old
 keshav maury ne apni chitthee main kshetreey akhabaaron kii kating ko bhi lagaaya jisase ki unke daawey kii pushti ho sake
 There was a ruckus on the letter, after writing the letter of Action Keshav Maurya, the Yogi government investigated and blacklisted 11 contract firm registered in Lucknow Development Authority and directed to take action against many people, but between CM and Deputy CM The new chapter of Ka Cold War opened with this
 sutara bataate hai ki keshav maury ke peedblyoody vibhaag par najar rakhane ke liye kuch khaas adhikariyon kii tainaati kii gai he
 At the same time, the officers who were trusted by Keshav Maurya have been removed from the department
 taaja maamla ramesh kumaar baranwaal ke khilaaf jaanch kaa he
 The EOW is investigating the rigging in the roads made under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) against three engineers, including PWD department head RC Barnwal
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne aarthik aparaadh shakha (iodblyoo) ko yah jaanch saunpi he
 Barnwal was recently given the additional charge of Chief Engineer (development) and Head of Department
 jabaki, pehle baranwaal ko hi nirmaan kaary ke kai maamalon kii jaanch kaa bhi jimmaa bhi diya gaya tha
 Sources reveal that CM Yogi Adityanath wanted to replace his trusted PWD officer RR Singh in place of Barnwal
 jabaki, baranwaal kesh ke kareebi hai yahi vajah rahi he ki baranwaal kii eemaandaaree ko lekar keshav saarvajanik rup se tarafdaari kar chuke hai
 The issue remained the opposition, the center is simple, the leader of the Congress, Akhilesh Pratap Singh, considers the corruption at the top level in the government because of this controversy
 unka kahana he ki donon ek duusare ke vibhaagon par aarope laga rahe hai, lekin kaarywahi koi nahin ho rahi he
 Seeking the matter to be investigated by the current judge, Akhilesh Pratap Singh says that the Governor should intervene in it and investigate against both the people
 uttar pradesh ke do sheersh netaaon ke bich mache ghamaasan kii jaankaree centre or sanghathan me baithe bade logon ko bhi he
 Sources reveal that the Chief Minister has also talked to the big people of the organization regarding Keshav Maurya and has also given information about all the cases in recent times
 duusari taraf keshav maury ne bhi sanghathan ke apane bharosemand logon se is bare main baat kii he
 Both leaders have their own lobbying
 tajposhi se hi than gai thi 'jang'darasal yogi adityanath or keshav prasad maury ke bich varchasv kii jang 2017 main tajposhi ke dauraan se hi shuru ho gai thi
 The feud between them started since the year 2017 when the BJP returned to UP with a landslide victory in the president of Keshav Prasad Maurya and later Yogi Adityanath was made the Chief Minister
 keshav prasad maury adhyaksh hone ke naate or uttar pradesh main bijepi kii prachand jeet ke chalate khud ko mukhyamantri kaa sabase prabal daavedaar maan rahe the, lekin ain maukey par yogi adityanath ne baaji maar lee thi
 In such a situation, despite the displeasure of Keshav Prasad Maurya, the Chief Minister was punished on the head of Yogi Adityanath
 us vakt keshav prasad maury ne virodh bhi jataayaa tha, lekin sheersh sanghathan ne unhen kisi tarah se samajha-bujhaakar shant kar diya tha or upmukhyamantri ke pad se nawaja tha
 Few days after the formation of the BJP government in UP, there has been an argument between Yogi Adityanath and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya
 yogi-keshav ke bich varchasv kii jang 2018 kii janvari main saaf ho hui, jab 24 janvari ko manaaya jane vaale pehle upi diwas main sabhi senior netaaon ko shaamil hona tha
 Keshav Prasad Maurya did not attend it
 sutara bataate hai keshav prasad maury is baat se naaraaz the ki upi diwas ke tamaam board or flex main unki photo ko nahin chapa gaya tha
 However, the reason behind the non-inclusion was stated by the leaders that they already had a program in Mumbai that day and when Keshav Maurya was not joining UP in the program, there was no question of printing his photo
 haalanki kisi ke paas is baat kaa makul jawaab nahin tha ki aakhir pradesh kaa bada program chhodkar maury duusare pradesh kyon gaye
 The long-running ceasefire seems to be broken, followed by many such occasions in the year 2018 in which Keshav Prasad Maurya was absent from the big programs
 20 janvari ko varanasi main yuva udghosh kaarykram main keshav maury ko nahin bulaayaa gaya to 23 janvari ko mantriyon kii baithak main keshav maury nahin pahunche
 After these incidents of continuous incidents in the state were noticed in Delhi, then gradually the matter was balanced in an undisclosed manner that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath would not have much interference in the department of Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya
 iske baad se donon netaaon ke bich sab kuch saamaanya chal rahaa tha, lekin achaanak is saal ke july maheene main yogi adityanath ne keshav prasad maury ke netritv vaale peedblyoody vibhaag ko apane nishane par le liya
 After this, Keshav Maurya retaliated, after which it started to become public that the war of supremacy between the two top leaders is still going on

 mistar parfectionist aamir khan kii is film 'dangal' ne naa sirf box offis par kai kirtiman banaae balki vuman raceling ko ek nai paribhaasha bhi di
 'dangal' has proved that a strong story with strong messages without makeup and fancy locations can set flags
 lekin tarif batorne ke saath saath yah film kai controvarsij main bhi fansati najar ai
 First, the real life coach, Togita Phogatake, put a legal case on the film, alleging that she had been unnecessarily shown in the film, whereas in reality it is not and that her relations with the Phogat family are very good
 uske baad aaj ek nai controvarsi saamne ai he jab adil khatri naam ke ek vakil ne film nirmaataaon par bharat ke raashtragan kaa apmaan karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Adil Khatri, with the help of an NGO named 'jai Ho Foundation', has demanded legal action against the makers of 'dangal'
 film ke ant main gita phogot ke jeetne ke baad bahut dhime swar main bharat kaa raashtragan shuru hota he
 The 'jai Ho Foundation' believes that it was not in line with the Supreme Court guidelines
 isi vajah se 'jai ho foundation' ke trustee or legal head adil khatri ne central board of film certification (sibiefasi) ko ek chitthee likhte hue maang kii he ki is par kanoonee kaarywahi honi chahie
 Adil is not only annoyed that the tone of the national anthem was too slow but he says that during this scene, the filmmakers should have put a disclaimer that the audience get up from their seats to honor the national anthem

 beete hafte relies hui siddharth malhotra or jacleen kii e jentalman to pehle hi res se baahar ho chuki he
 In such a situation, if Badshaho is compared to a film after Shubh Mangal Savdhan, then that film will be Bareilly's Barfi

 In such a situation, the film has to cross at least 120 crores to be a hit

 Ajay Devgan's Shivaay, released last year, earned around 34 crores in three-four days of release, while there seems to be some hope from Badshaho's first day collection

 He has sought this report from Madhya Pradesh Congress in-charge Deepak Bavaria

 In it, he said that Digvijay Singh has asked the ministers to respond to the work done by him
 isse kuch mantri asahaj hai
 It is being told that Sonia Gandhi is very angry with Umang Singhar's statement
 deepak baavariyaa ne apni report main kaha ki umang singhar ke bayanon se party kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaa he
 Some of his statements about Digvijay Singh are objectionable, which could have been avoided
 agar aage kisi netaa ne bayaanbaji kii to us par karrwai hogi
 Actually, Madhya Pradesh Forest Minister Umang Singhar had described former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh as a blackmailer
 saath hi digvijay singh par parde ke peeche se sarkaar chalaane kaa aarope jadaa tha
 After this, Digvijay Singh came in front of the media and gave clarification
 unhone umang singhar ke aaropon ko sire se khaarij karte hue kaha ki anushaasanheenata karne vaale party netaaon ke khilaaf karrwai honi chahie
 Digvijay Singh said that indiscipline in the party will not be tolerated at all

 On Wednesday, he spoke to the media in Gwalior and supported Forest Minister Umang Singhar
 unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar ko apane dam par chalanaa chahie
 Nobody should interfere in this
 sindhiya ne kaha ki umang singhar dwaara uthaae gaye muddon ko achche se sunanaa chahie
 i feel that Chief Minister Kamal Nath of the state should sit on both sides on this matter and resolve the dispute as soon as the Congress government is formed in Madhya Pradesh after 15 years of hard work
 unhone kaha ki kamalnath sarkaar ko satta main aae abhi 6 maheene bhi nahin hue hai or congress party main vivaad shuru ho gaya he

 It is said that the road to power at the center passes through Uttar Pradesh
 lekin bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke liye rasta varanasi se hokar guzar rahaa he
 The city can affect all 120 parliamentary constituencies in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 yahaan brahman, rajput or bhoomihaar jaisi oonchi jatiyon kii aabaadi kareeb 20 fisadi he
 Upper castes may be mobilized in favor of Modi
 yahi baat hindi hriday pradesh main bijepi ke liye ahm hone ja rahi he
 The India Today group-cicero special Varanasi opinion poll shows what will be the trend there on 12 May
 isamen vahaan ke logon ke mood kaa bhi vishleshan kiya gaya he, jisase 2014 kii sarvaadhik pratikshit chunavi jang kii tasviir saaf hone vaali he
 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal's challenge to Modi has made this fight more interesting
 surveykshan ke mutabik, dilli main shila dikshit ke safaaye kii vajah bana kejariwal kaa jaadu varanasi main nahin chal paa rahaa he
 Modi is leading with a majority of votes and his opponents are limited to splitting in less than 50 percent of the vote
 congress ke ajay raay duusare number par ubhare hai to samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke kailashnath chaurasia or bahujan samaaj party (bispi) ke vijay prakaash jaiswal ko 10 fisadi se bhi kam vot milane kii ummid he
 Modi leads in all classes of voters with 56 percent votes
 varanasi seat kaa zyaadaatar hissaa shahari kshetra he
 In urban areas, Modi has a huge edge (61 per cent), which is much higher than in rural areas
 surveykshan ke mutabik, ucch aay varg ke voter bijepi ko bade paimaane par vot (60 fisadi) karne vaale hai jo nimna aay varg (55 fisadi) ke mukaable zyada he
 The same trend is also true in the case of voters of different educational categories
 varanasi kaa jaateey ganit bhi pradesh ke kul rujhaan ke anukool baithta he, jo is saal march ke antim or april ke pehle hafte main india today group-sisero ke janamat surveykshan main ubhara tha
 In Varanasi, about one-fourth of upper caste voters are going to vote for BJP outright
 oonchi jatiyon ke votaron main baaki dalon kii hissedari mahaj ek ank main simat gai he
 Ajay Rai is the only exception with 17 per cent Bhumihar vote
 varanasi jile ke pindra kshetra se vidhayak raay lokapriy bhoomihaar netaa hai
 But his appeal in his caste is not able to make a difference on the air of Modi among the upper castes
 bijepi ko 67 fisadi bhoomihaar vot miltaa lag rahaa he
 At the same time, Yadav is divided between BJP (41 per cent) and SP (40 per cent), while other OBC castes are inclined towards BJP
 bispi ke paramparaagat voter jatvon main bhi kareeb ek-tihaai bijepi kii ore jate dikh rahe hai
 Though the BSP is leading with 44 per cent, but in the last 15 years, this will be the lowest number of Jatavs who voted for the party
 varanasi ke kul votaron kaa kareeb 20 fisadi muslim vot vibhinn dalon main bantata dikh rahaa he
 In the traditional view, they give outright votes against the most powerful candidate against the BJP
 yah tark yahaan kuch had tak hi dikh rahaa he
 About 40 per cent of Muslims can vote for Congress while 20 per cent for AAP
 aashcharya yah ki 17 fisadi muslim vot bijepi ko jaataa dikh rahaa he
 India Today group-cicero's Uttar Pradesh survey has indicated that this time a small section of Muslims in the state will vote for BJP
 yadi aisa hua to is dharna par prashnchihn lag jayega ki hindi pradeshon main bijepi kii kamyaabi hindu-muslim dhruvikaran par hi aadhaarit he
 The public opinion poll of all sections of Varanasi shows that polarization is not the basis of bjp's increased vote bank
 kareeb 54 fisadi votaron kii raay main modi ke yahaan se chunaav ladgaye se shahar main sampradayik tanaav nahin badha
 Surprisingly 47 per cent of Muslims also agree with this
 par modi yadi vadodara se saansad rahakar varanasi kii seat chhodte hai to upachunaav main kya ve bijepi ko vot denge? 29 fisadi kaa kahana he ki nahin
 But 27 percent say that they will stay with the BJP in any case
 surveykshan ke mutabik, varanasi main utsaah kii vajah modi kii ummidavaari he
 People are not at all excited by Rahul Gandhi's arrival in Varanasi to challenge Modi
 bheed ko aakarshith karne main maahir kejariwal par bhi jan lokapal ke mudde par 24 farvari ko dilli main sarkaar chhodie kaa sawaal baari pad rahaa he
 More than two-thirds of the people in the survey denied their move
 varanasi desh ko aglaa pradhanmantri dene kii ummid main he
 Modi has put four moons in this dream of common voter of Varanasi
 agar ve jeet jate hai to kya is shahar kii aakankshaon ko puraa kar paaenge?dhananjay joshi chunaav visheshgy or nai dilli ke sisero associats and kansaltents privet limited ke nideshak hai
 Ishant Sharma's career has been full of ups and downs due to injuries

 In an interview, Ishant Sharma said, 'mahi Bhai helped me a lot during this time, i was emotionally broke
 agar mahibhai kii tarah captain ho or 24wein floor se kudane ko kahe, to aap ek baar soche bina bhi taiyaar ho jate hai
 Mahi Bhai helped me a lot to overcome depression

 Therefore, for quick decision, it has been decided that now all the files are sent to the CM office without disturbing the Lieutenant Governor
 lekin dilachasp baat yah he ki dilli sarkaar ke aadesh main kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri kejariwal ne is nirnay ke bare main uparajyapal ko likh diya he, lekin uparajyapal kii taraf bheji gai relies main ek khabar ko aadhaar banaakar nirdesh jari kiye hai

 Even the education minister Chudasama encouraged the tantrikas by calling them seekers of divine powers
 jis vyakti kaa kaam shiksha ke madhyam se andhvishwaas kam karnaa he, wo hi ise badhaava de rahaa he
 Explain that according to the invitation card, the entire program was organized by the local BJP unit
 jab donon mantri is aayojan main upasthit hue to uske kuch samay baad hi iskaa videon soshal media par viral ho gaya
 With this, this thing slowly caught hold of the mind

 He said that he will write in this letter that ministers who participate in these events promoting superstition should be banned
 unhone kaha ki maine pehali baar aisa dekha he ki mantri aise aayojanon main bhaag le rahe he
 Jahubhuta-phantoms are honored
 saath hi andhvishwaas ko badhaayaa jaataa he
 He said that this is a very shameful act

 bulandshahr jila aspataal ke ye sweepar or wardbvoy vah sab karte hai, jiske liye inhen aspataalon main moti pagaar paa rahe embibies doctor rakhe gaye hai
 And the most dangerous aspect of this truth is that all this is happening under the flag bearers of the hospital's CMS, ie the Chief Medical Officer

 Will not be able to stop
 unhone yah baat bhartiya janata party kii virdohi partiyon kii lathi raily main kahi
 The rally was organized by the Akhil Bharatiya Mahatma Phule Samata Parishad at Chhola Dussehra ground on the 54th birthday of former MP Sukhlal Kushwaha, in which socialist leader Sharad Yadav along with Prakash Ambedkar also appealed to the backward, Dalits and tribals to unite

 All this is happening at the behest of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 unhone chetavanee bhare andaaj main kaha, 'agar maharashtra main doshiyon par karrwai nahin hui, to hinduon main bhi hafiz said paidaa honge
 If it is to be stopped, then the culprits should be acted upon
 'apane maan ke liye ekajute hone kii jarurat: prakaash ambedakambedkar ne desh main saamaajik loktantr laane kii pairvi karte hue kaha ki choti samajhi jane vaali jatiyon ko apane maan-sammaan ke liye ekajute hona hoga
 He said that Congress President Arun Yadav in Madhya Pradesh belongs to the caste, now the Congress has to decide who it wants to become the Chief Minister after winning the assembly elections
 gujarat main agar congress adivaasiyon ko apane se jodne main safal ho jaati, to uski sarkaar banani tay thi

 He said, 'the battle fought against the Peshwai was fought by small castes

 The question arises that are people of small caste not Hindus? Why should Hindus attack them? ' Sharad said, "the question is, when the government supports the culprits, then who will control them? Therefore, i am saying that the situation in the country is terrible, and will be frightening

 They too without telling the forest minister

 The forest minister has expressed his anger through a letter
 saath hi sabhi aaladhikariyon ko turant waapas aane kaa farmaan jari kar diya he
 Let us tell you that the forests of Uttarakhand have been under fire since some time
 aag kii lapaton kii aanch ab uttarakhand shashan tak bhi pahunch gayi he
 At this time, the matter has caught fire due to the four responsible officers of the Forest Department going on a foreign tour and the Forest Minister Harak Singh Rawat not knowing about it
 harak singh ravat ne pramukh van sangrakshak jayraj ke videsh jane ko lekar naaraazgi jataai he
 In this case, the Forest Minister has written to the Secretary of Personnel
 apni naaraazgi jataate hue harak singh ravat ne kaha he ki pramukh van sangrakshak jinke paas puure vibhaag kii jimmedaari he wo videsh chale jate hai or van mantri ko is baat kaa pataa tak nahin hota he
 Expressing displeasure in the letter to the Personnel Secretary, Forest Minister Harak Singh Rawat has written that why did the Personnel Department not inform him about the chief forest guard Jairaj going abroad? Harak Singh Rawat is scheduled to meet Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat soon
 van mantri harak singh ravat kaa kahana ki unhen keval 3 adhikariyon ke videsh jane kii file praapt hui thi, jise unhone manjuuri di thi
 But the name of the Chief Conservator of Forests was not included in those 3 officers
 agar unhen ye maaloom hota to vah shaayad pramukh van sangrakshak ke videsh daure ko manjuuri nahin dete
 Because this time, protecting the forests of Uttarakhand is the biggest challenge for the department
 harak singh ravat kaa kahana he ki pradesh main adhikari galat paramparaon ko janm de rahe hai
 The officials are forwarding the files without the approval of the departmental minister
 yah pradesh ke liye sahi nahin he

 The major failure of the UPA government was probably not that it did not take decisions
 faisle to hue hi the tabhi to modi sarkaar upie model se aage nahin bad paa rahi he
 Manmohan Singh's biggest failure was that he could not stop the tsunami of negative dialogues, which eventually shattered the government
 narendra modi sarkaarabhi isi ghat par phisal rahi he
 The most worrying Modi should be that his government is surrounded by discussions at the very divisive and communal dialogues that the Vajpayee government had lost in its infancy and eventually lost popularity
 bharat main nai sarkaar se judi vimarsh badalane kii aahat neuyork, sinfrancisco or boston ke financial district tak suni ja sakati he, jahaan bharat main sudhaar kii sambhaavnaaon par karodon dollar laga chuke niveshak baithte hai
 Frustrated by the absence of drastic reforms, these investors are making frenzied events more intimidating
 colombia uniwarsity main bhaashan ke liye neuyork pahunche (6 aktubar, 2015) vitt mantri arun jetali dadri kii ghatana par yun hi pareshaan nahin dikhe, unhen niveshkon kii is jhunjhalaahat kaa baqayada ehsaas hua he
 Two negative dialogues about the government have started taking root simultaneously
 ugr hindutv kaa vetal bijepi kii peeth par hameshaa se savaar rahaa he jo sushasan ke nirgun, niraakaar aahvaanon ko peeche dhakel kar aage aane laga he, jabaki duusari taraf sarkaar main kuch thos na ho paane yaa jameen par badlaav najar na aane ke akalan mukhar ho rahe hai jo sudhaar shoonyata ke ehsaas ko gadha karte hai
 Modi's speeches reflect the failure of the government's failure to keep the dialogues positive
 america jane se pehle apni jansabhaon main modi vikaas ke thamane ke liye congress ko kos rahe the jabaki america main unke bhaashan, 16 maah kii gavarnence kii bajaae bhaavnaatmak va rashtravaadi muddon par kendrit rahe jo utsaah banaae rakhane kii koshishon kaa hissaa the
 Despite these efforts of Modi, the government's vast publicity system has failed to stop the expected debates
 pratibandhon kii divaani rajya sarkarein, vikaas or sudhaar kii charchaa ko dhwast kar rahi hai jabaki kaam main susti ko lekar naukarshahi par thikra phodte kendriya mantri (nitin gadakari) sarkaar kii vivashtaa kii nazeer ban rahe hai
 There are two reasons for changing the mood of the dialogues
 pehali yah ki modi kaa chunaav abhiyaan shandaar taiyaariyon kii misaal bhale hi rahaa lekin bijepi gavarnence ke liye taiyaar nahin thi
 Issues such as land acquisition, GST, one rank, one pension and black money abroad prove that no preparations were made before elections and even after coming to power, dialogue on complex decisions or any mechanism to prove progress respectively Not developed
 duusari vajah shaayad yah he ki modi apni gavarnence ko bataane ke liye prabhavi pratik chunane main chook gaye hai
 In the last 16 months, the government has taken at least two dozen new initiatives (missions, schemes, etc
), but none of these experiments could give a change that was felt
 sarkaar kii sabhi pahal pratikatmak or rajyastareey hai jinke peeche thos karyanvayan kaa dhaancha nahin he or rajyon se samanvay nadaarad he
 Vajpayee's tenure could become a prelude to Modi in many respects
 vaajapeyi bhi teen alpajivi sarkaron ke baad ummiido ke ufaan par baith kar satta main aae the or ugr hindutv kaa khatra unki sarkaar ko bhi tha
 Vajpayee had already set the road map of the goals of governance to keep the discourse focused on development and to distance himself from militant Hindutva, with the help of which the government had taken many corrective steps until the bugle of Shila Pujan and Ram Mandir movement in 2001
 
 modi kii musiibat yah he ki ve na to sudhaaron or gavarnence kii thos manzilen tay kar paae hai jinke aasapaas doorgaami ummid kii charchaaen ho saken or na hi unhone vaajapeyi kii tarah badi buniyadi dhaancha pariyojnaon or nirmaanon ko chunaa jo gavarnence ke joardaar aagaaj kaa paracham uthaa saken
 Modi has given wings to expectations, has chosen a policy of one-way dialogues and rides on the turtles of schemes, so the noise of changing nothing is getting louder
 24 disambar, 2014 ko isi stambh main hamane likhaa tha ki modi ko ugr hindutv kii lapat se bachane ke liye apni gavarnence ke vyaavhaarik lakshya tay karne honge, nahin to unke parivaar ke yogi, sakshi or sadhvi unhen agle kuch maheenon main hi 2002 kaa vaajapeyi bana denge
 Modi's latest dilemma is similar to Vajpayee in 2001, despite all the reforms, Vajpayee could not escape the grip of the insistence of radical Hindutva
 2001 main ayodhya ko lekar sarkaar va vihip ke bich morcha khulaa tha
 By the beginning of 2002, confrontation, increased tension, rock burning in Godhra, riots in Gujarat and the atmosphere became toxic due to Shila Pujan
 vaajapeyi ne 2002 or '03 main aarthik sudhaaron kii bharsak koshish kii
 Three legislatures were also won at the end of 2003 but the government that gave the country the best governance and fastest growth did not return in 2004
 2002 ke sampradayik tanaav se ubhara vimarsh vaajapeyi sarkaar kii bejod parformens ko nigal gaya tha
 Of course, decisions in democracy have a pace of their own, but positivity is essential in government-related dialogues
 taaja nakaaratmak samvaad, mohabhang kii taraf badhen isse pehle modi ko ugr hindutv ko khaarij karnaa hoga or apekshaaon ko tarksangat karte hue ummiido ko jagaane vaali thos charchaa kii taraf lautnaa hoga
 There is hardly any other leader in India at this time who can understand this better than Modi that if the discussion changes, it does not take time to change public opinion and politics

 In this letter, Anant has targeted Smriti's statement in Parliament on Rohit Vemula suicide case
 yahi nahin, unhone cese main mantralay kii taraf sehyderabad uniwarsity par daale gaye dabaavako lekar bhi smriti se kai sawaal kiye hai
 Read, Anant's letter in the form of service, Smt
 Smriti Irani, "nationalist", Minister of Human Resource Development, Government of India heard your speech in Parliament
 isse pehle kii main apni baat rakhun, yah spasht kar duun ki yah patr kisi 'bachche' kaa kisi 'mamtamayi' mantri ke naam nahin he balki yah patr ek khaas vichaardhaara kii raajnneeti karne vaale vyakti kaa patr duusare raajnneetik vyakti ko he
 First of all, let me make it clear that i do not assess the merit of any person on the basis of his educational qualification, but rather, clearly, i reject the entire concept of 'merit'
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay kaa pad bhaar lene ke saath hi yah apeksha kii jaati he ki aap is desh ke kendriya vishvavidhyalayon main unki autonomi kaa sammaan karte hue uske liye uttaradaayi hongi
 What you did in the case of Rohit Vemula, it is in front of everyone that how you pressurized the administration there, which resulted in Rohit's institutional murder
 lekin main in sari chijo par abhi baat nahin karnaa chahta
 You repeatedly assert the identity of being a woman and you should do this because the female caste is one of the many marginalized people who have been exploited for centuries
 main aapse yah poochna chahta hum ki ek dalit stri jo ki har takalif uthaate hue akele apane dam par jab apane bete-betiyon ko is samaaj main ek sammanpurn jagah dene ke liye sangharsh kar rahi thi, tab ek nari hone ke kaaran aap kii kya jimmedaari banati thi? kya aapako us mahila ke jazbe ko salaam karte hue uski bahaduree ke aage sar jhukaate hue uske saath nahin khadaa hona chahie tha? haa, main rohit kii maa ke bare main baat kar rahaa hum
 Why was the woman who was being fought with this Brahminical and patriarchal society, connecting her children with her identity, you and your government to that woman with the identity of her husband? You might also like that you have your own independent identity
 lekin yah adhikaar aap us mahila se kyon chin raheen thim? kya aap bhi pitrusattatmak va brahamnavaadi samaaj ke paksh main khadi hoti hai? apana puraa naam bataate hue apni jati ke bare main aapane sawaal poocha or aapkaa bhaashan khatm hone ke pehle hi logon ne aapaki jati nikaal di
 i am not interested in your caste and i do not believe that if you are of high caste then you will be a racist but in the letters written by your department / ministry, Rohit and his colleagues are racist / caste-ist told
 madam kya aap caste-ism or caste assertion kaa antar samajhati hai? main samajhataa hum kii aap ye antar bhalee–bhaanti samajhati hai kyonki aresas jo aapaki sarkaar or mantralay ko chalaata he, vah varna vyavastha ke naam par jati vyasvastha ko bhartiya samaaj kii aatma samajhataa he or aresas ke agenda ko lagu karwaane kii raajnneetik dridhtaa hamane samay-samay par aap main dekhi hai
 i hope that you have read Manusmriti and you will know how much political commitment the RSS has regarding the values of Manusmriti
 aapako yah spasht hoga kii wo mulya dalit or nari samudaay ke prati hamaare andar kis tarah kii chetana ko sthapit karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Being a Dalit, i feel very humiliated and battered by reading this, but as a woman, why do you not have this Bachchani born in you? When you try to be emotional while giving your speech, you are almost successful, is that sentiment even when reading Manusmriti? If you have not read Manusmriti yet, i hope that after reading that book, as a woman, you will leave BJP immediately and before that in Parliament with a Dalit MP who can also be Udit Raj He will burn Manusmriti
 aapane apane bhaashan main cheekh cheekh kar kaha kii rohit ke mrityu ke upar raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Madam, perhaps you are not so stupid that you do not know that Rohit's death was the result of saffron politics
 rohit dakshinpanthi raajnneeti, jisaki vaahak aap bhi hai, ke khilaaf tha jisaki keemat use apni jaan ganvaakar chukaani padi
 Yet see Rohit's greatness that he forgave you
 aaj aapaki sarkaar va sanghathan is desh ke har vishvavidhyalay ko chaatro kii kabrgah bananaa chaahate hai
 First IIT Madras, FTII, then HCU, AU, and now JNU
 hamaare maamle main aapane sansad main jaanch kamity kaa hawala diya, lekin kya aapako yah yaad nahin he ki aapaki chitthiyaan jo hyderabad ja raheen thim vah vahaan kii jaanch kamity ke hi nirnay ko badane kaa dabaav daal rahi thim? hamaare maamle main kya hua? bina hamaari baat sune hin hamen de-barred kar diya jaataa he
 But don't you know the principle of natural justice that you cannot take a decision without listening to a person
 kya sansad main hamaara naam padhate samay aapako yah saavdhaanee nahin rakhni chahie thi ki inquairi kamity ke nirnay aane kaa intazaar kar liya jaae?aapane mahisasur shahadat diwas kii baat kii
 Don't you know that this country has all kinds of religious sentiments (which you don't believe in)
 is desh ke samvidhan ne sabko baraabar adhikaar va swatantrata de rakhi he
 Do you not know that in some parts of this country, Dalits and Adivasis associate their religious feelings with Mahishasura? i am a communist and do not believe in religion, but i believe that any person has his own right to decide his religious beliefs and on the issue of violating the character of any woman, even on this issue, JNU The leaflets of the Left parties are with our Union Registrar
 kripaya use bhi manga kar ke pard len
 While referring to the courts of this country, you tried to tell that if we go to the court for any judicial treatment then we cannot question that institution
 bahut hi choti samajhadaari he aapaki
 According to you, it means that if a laborer is working in a factory and is getting salary from there, then he will not speak against the injustice done to him
 mai is tark ko ek sire se khaarij karata hoon, meraa maananaa yah he kii kisi bhi sanstha ko behatar banane ke liye yah zaruri he ki uske dosha / kami / kamajoriyon par nirmamata se bahes kiya jaae or use sudhaar kar or behatar banaaya jaae
 Apart from this, you talked more
 in sabhi baton ko sunne ke baad kya aapako sach main nadaan maan liya jaae? yaa baat kuch or hi hai? ham sab yah jaanate hai ki aapaki maujuuda sarkaar ko is samay desh main sabase zyada chunauti chaatro, kisaano or buddhijiviyon se mil rahi hai
 That is why these classes are completely on the target of RSS
 chaatro ne aapaki sarkaar banane se pehle hin aapke phacist ravaiye ke khilaaf morcha khol diya tha
 Your government is fully committed to implementing the agenda of cultural nationalism of the RSS, which has corporate support
 or uske liye yah zaruri he kii samaaj se sochane or tark karne kii kshamta ko khatm kar diya jaay
 Since universities are places of logic and scientificism, that's why we came to the natural target
 aap aar es es ke brahamnavaadi hindutv rashtrawaad evam korporate agenda ko lagu karne main itnaa mashgool ho chukin hai ki aapane kisi bhi vishvavidhyalay ko bane rahane ke jo mulya hote hai unako barbaad karne kii kasam kha lee hai
 You stand with your political ideology which does not believe in multiculturalism, and we stand with multiculturalism, we do not expect any mercy from you and strike as fast as we can
 Will face you with full courage antim baat kah karke apni baat khatm karuunga, ek baar kabhi kisi ne aapke ghar ke baahar protest kiya tha to aap camere ke aage aakar rone kii koshish kar raheen thi or apane bacchon ke dar kaa hawala de raheen thim, lekin meri maa nahin ro rahi hai, bas thodi chintit hai lekin phir bhi bole ja rahi hai ki modi se ladate rahanaa, darana mat

 Let me tell you that 'ek Tha Tiger' was directed by Kabir Khan but Ali Abbas Zafar, director of the film 'sultan' will direct its sequel
 jis tarah ali abbaas ne 'sultan' main salmaan ke liye resler kaa mjedaar kirdaar buna tha usee tarah is sikval main bhi unhone salmaan ke liye kuch hatke sochaa he
 If sources are to be believed, 'tiger Zinda Hai' will be seen in such a role of Malsalman, which hardly Salman has played before

 Mix both the things in equal amounts before going to bed every day and apply them on the cracked lips
 jald hi aaraam mil jayega

 ungali main thodaa sa desi ghi lekar hont par halke haath se massage karen
 This will increase blood circulation and relieve the problem of rupturing lips

 Today 4 large states of India are headed by democratically elected women: PM— ANI (@ani_news)march 12, 2016 Lionel Messi scored his first goal in his first match of the tournament, but his goal came after a long time
 messi ke phans or aalochak donon hi unase maradona kii tarah chamakane kii ummid kar rahe hai
 For Messi too, this tournament is his last chance to join the list of great players
 pichley world cap main messi koi gol karne main naakaam rahe or is world cap main un par argentina kii team ko teesri dfa world cap kaa khitaab hasil karwaane kaa beintahaa dabaav he
 Messi wants his coach Alayandro Sabeya to give him a chance to play an important role in the match against Iran, relying on the attacking ability of the team
 yani captain messi do striker (jaise sarjeeo aguero, ezequel lavetji, gonzalo higuin) ko aage rakhkar khud ko unke peeche rakhana chaahate hai, taaki counter atake main unhen phayda ho sake
 According to Messi, Argentina has more players in the attacking line, so there is already more potential in the attack
 do baar champion rah chuki argentina kii team ranking ke lihaaj se iran se 38 paaydaan aage yani paanchaven number par he
 Argentina also have a different status, so by winning the second match of the group stage, this team will want to secure their place for the last 16 immediately
 iran ne apane pehle match main nigeria ke khilaaf match ko 0−0 se drow rakhaa, lekin argentina ke khilaaf unhen is str se or upar uthakar khelnaa hoga
 Iran's team is playing only its fourth World Cup tournament
 1978, 1998 or 2006 teenon hi dfa yah team pehle round main baahar ho gai
 During this time he won against America only once
 lekin iran ke putargali coach carlos kieros or unke striker reza gushananezaad ko bharosa he ki unki team argentina kii team ko acchhee takkar jarur degi, isliye argentina ke khilaaf yah team jeet ke bajaae drow rakhane kii ranneeti par hi jor degi
 If this happens, it would be considered as a huge victory for Iran
 lekin messi or unki team aisa hone den, aisa match se pehle to bilkul nahin kaha ja saktaa

 pustak kaa naam- murde itihaas nahin likhtelekhika- alka agarwalprakashak- unistar buxmoolya- 295 rupeelaka agarwal kaa katha sangrah 'murde itihaas nahin likhte' samaaj ke har varg kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Every story shocks the mind, stimulates and attracts the attention of readers
 har katha main koi naa koi sandesh he
 In a story, true friendship proves usefulness in life, then somewhere there is a connection of relationships
 kahin samaapt naa hone vaali atmiyata he to koi kahani samaaj kaa aainaa dikhaati he to kahin jivan ke yatharth se dur keval or keval adarshavaad he
 In spite of all this, the collection of fiction keeps the mind in mind and advocates an optimistic view towards the future
 yah sach he ki jivan main hamen naa jane kitne sangharshon se jujhna padataa he or yahi sangharsh hamen or zyada dridhtaa pradaan karata he
 Makes us tolerant and understands the dignity of relationships and does not let them disintegrate, but gives them a new energy full of feeling of belonging
 yahi he alka kikahaniyonka sandesh or jivan kaa saar ki prayek pathak kahani padhakar kahin kho sa jaataa he or vah kahani alka ke kahani sangrah kii kahani naa rahakar us pathak ke jivan kii ghatana ban jaati he, saath hi har man par gaharaa asar daalati he
 The story 'dead do not write history' is inspiring and it gives a message by shaking the mind that if we make our own way then we also have confidence and our own identity is formed and this identity separates us from the crowd
 alka kii kahaniyon main sahajata he, jivan kii sachai he isiilie kathaon kaa pravaah rukta nahin balki ati saralata or sahajata se har katha aage badhati he, gaharaai se utarati he hday main
 The courage to fight and fight with the truth of anguish and life is also found in the stories of Alka
 'tikuli' kahani badi maarmik he
 The truth of the relationship in 'river not yet dry'
 jati or dharm se pare sirf maanviya samvednaaen hi hai jo hamen ek-duusare ke liye jeena or samarpit hona sikhaati hai
 Alka not only awakens sleeping human sensations through her stories but also makes readers prone to emotion
 alka agarwal ke sangrah kii kuch kahaniyon ke kathy aise hai ki unke liye kisi shabd vaishishty kii bhi aavashyaktaa nahin balki vah hamaare man ke gavaakshon main sahajata se pravisht hokar samvednaaon ko jagaati hai
 The stories in Alka's collection of stories are not fictional but give the appearance of true stories
 prathit hota he ki alka ko prayaas nahin karnaa padaa balki anubhoot ghatnaon ne shabdon kaa aakaar grahan kiya or katha srujit hoti chali gai
 All the stories leave a deep impact on the mind, both in its craft and narrative

 These parties are misleading to be Gundaraja in UP
 aapaki sarkaar par muslim tushtikaran ke aarope bhi lag rahe hai
 It is being said that SP can go to any extent to get the votes of Muslims in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? Muslims have done a lot for SP
 meri sarkaar yaa sapa musalamaanon kaa tushtikaran nahin kar rahi
 It is a section which is much more backward than others in the society
 ham sirf inhen barabari par khadaa karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 No one should object to this
 durga ke nilamban kii asli vajah khanan mafia ke khilaaf kii gai karrwai ko mana ja rahaa he jabaki aapaki sarkaar ne un par masjid kii diwaar giraane kaa aarope lagaakar musalamaanon kii sahanubhuti paane kii koshish kii he?sachai yahi he ki durga ke nilamban kii iklauti vajah rajamaan ke maheene main masjid kii diwaar giraane kii karrwai hi thi
 This IAS officer did not show maturity in taking this action
 agar vahaan koi avaidh nirmaan ho rahaa tha to pehle notice dena chahie tha
 Further action should have been taken after that
 yah ek samvedansheel vishay tha, jisase behad gaiyr-jimmedaarana dhang se nibata gaya
 Due to this, there was a possibility of disturbing the peace in the area
 jahaan tak khanan kaa vishay he, iske khilaaf karrwai karne se durga ko kabhi bhi roka nahin gaya
 It is mentioned in the official report that the mosque wall was demolished in a very peaceful manner and there was no possibility of deteriorating law and order? unhone gaanv main ghoshnaa kii thi ki jab tak masjid kii diwaar gir nahin jaati vah gaanv main hi rahengi, chaahe iske liye do-teen din tak kyon na rahanaa pade
 The villagers declared a panchayat the next day against it
 agar panchayat main ve koi sakht faisla le lete to koun jawaab detaa
 Did you know that the suspension of Durga would hold so much trouble? i had no doubt that the matter would reach this stage
 asal main durga ke nilamban se do din pehle kendriya mantri jairam ramesh kaa ek bayaan aayaa tha jisamen unhone upi main manaregaa ke paise ke kam kharch hone kii baat kahi thi
 Then i asked the Principal Secretary Rural Development to bring a list of 10 districts whose performance is the worst in the MNREGA
 maine in 10 jilon main se do ke dm or sidio ko turant nilambit karne kaa aadesh bhi diya
 Not only this, an order was also given for the suspension of the vice chairman of Agra Development Authority, who was negligent in the construction of "inner Circle Road" in the district
 upaadhyaksh ke nilamban par to mukhya sachiv ke hastakshar bhi ho gaye the
 Apart from this, there were complaints about another IAS officer smoking cigarette in front of everyone in his office
 in sabhi ko durga ke saath hi nilambit kiya janaa tha lekin durga kaa nilamban kaa aadesh jari kar agle hi din main bangaloru chalaa gaya or jab laut kar aayaa to is maamle ne kaaphi tool pakad rakhaa tha
 If all these officers were suspended in sequence, there would not be so much ruckus
 ab durga kii vajah se inkaa nilamban ruk gaya kyonki ab aisa karuunga to log kahenge ki main iees ke peeche pad gaya hum
 Due to Durga being a female officer and posted close to Delhi, the media fiercely raised the issue
 lekin aapke faisle se soobe ke iees adhikari bhi ittefaq nahin rakhte
 The IAS Association also made several efforts in support of Durga? a principal secretary in the previous Mayawati government had a suspicious death at his home, so the same IAS officers could not muster the courage to speak in favor of his colleague
 pichley dinon main unnav gaya tha
 i asked the DM there to take me to the wheat procurement center where the best work is happening
 dm ne mujhe bataaya ki usne ek bhi centre kaa nirikshan nahin kiya he
 i had a good reason to suspend him on the spot but the DM immediately accepted the mistake and i forgave him
 shaayad yah meri galati he
 i should have fixed the officers in advance
 desh ke kai shaharon ke privet medical collejon main donneton ke jariye doctoron kii degree kii nilaamee ho rahi he
 Aaj Tak has revealed through a sting operation that there are many medical colleges in cities like Ballabhgarh, Hapur and Ghaziabad adjoining the capital Delhi where MBBS seats are being sold openly for millions of rupees
 jabaki supreme court kaa nirdesh he ki koi bhi college admician ke naam par kisi tarah kii donneton yaa capitesan fees nahin le saktaa he
