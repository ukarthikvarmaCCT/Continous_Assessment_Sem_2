 About 61 million people could get Nano cars for free
 har hindustani ko 56 hajaar rupeya phir garibi kii rekha se neeche rah rahe sabhi 40 karod logon main se har ek ko ek lakh 82 hajaarrupee mil sakate the
 That is, the picture of the whole country could have changed
 tasviir dikhaati he kibharat garibon kaa desh he
 But the world's biggest rich live here
 agar aisa nahin hota to swiss bank ke khate main sabase zyada paise hamaara jamaanhin hota
 According to the figures, Indians have a total deposit of 65,223 billion rupees in Swiss bank
 yani jitna paisa hamaara swiss bank main jamaa he,vah hamaare jidipi kaa 6 guna he
 Statistics also show that India has to take a loan of Rs 3 lakh crore to feed the people of our country and run the country
 yahiwajah he ki jahaan ek taraf prati vyakti aay bad rahi he, vahiin duusari taraf harek bhartiya par karj bhi bad rahaahe
 If even 30 to 40 percent of the black money deposited in Swiss banks comes into the country, then we will not have to spread hands before the IMF or World Bank for the loan
 swiss bank main bharatiyon kaa jitna blike mani jamaa he, agar vah sara paisawapas aa jaae todesh ko bajet main tees saal tak koi tex nahin lagaana padegaa
 The common man will not have to pay income tax and there will be no custom or cell tax on anything
 sarkaar sabhi gaanvon ko sadakon se jodna chaahati he
 40 lakh crore rupees is needed for this
 agar swiss bank se blike mani waapas aa gaya to har gaanvtakachaar len kii sadakpahunch jaaegi
 If the amount of money that Indians have deposited in Swiss bank, they also get half of it, then around 30 crore new jobs can be created
 har hindustaniko 2000 rupee muft die ja sakate hai
 And this sequence could continue for 30 years
 yani deshse garibi puri tarah dur ho sakati he
 But for this to happen, it is necessary to sweep the corruption and bribe first
 par sawaal vahi he aakhir in par jhaadu kab chalegi?28 disambar ko ramlila maidan ke is tarikhi jameen kii kokh main ek khwab boyaa gaya tha
 Now his bones are bursting
 pehali baar aapane apni hunkaar ko saream jitate dekha hai
 But should not that corruption defeat it? Because the question wrapped in fear is still the same
 rag-rag main bhar chukaa bhrashtachar kaa nasha ham sab kaise chhodege? These days whatsapp is in the headlines for child pornography, not because of its features
 pichley kuch samay se lagaataar reports aa rahi hai ki watsap par bharat sahit kai deshon child pornography ke liye grups banaae ja rahe hai
 In such groups, such content shares are also being done in a jittery manner
 ab watsap ne kadam uthaaya he or 1 lakh 30 hajaar se zyada acounts block or delit kiye gaye hai
 In the recent 10 days, the company has started removing these accounts from whatsapp
 company ne haal pichley saal hi kaha tha ki artificial intelligence kaa sahaara lekar aise acounts chhante jate hai
 whatsapp found these accounts through AI tools and then deleted them due to illegal activity
 gauratlab he ki watsap ke chats and tu and ancrypted hote hai
 This security means that only the sender and receiver can see and read the message or content sent on whatsapp
 itnaa hi nahin company bhi inhen nahin pard sakati he
 That's why whatsapp is resorting to AI for illegal content
 ye tul watsap acount ke an-encripted jaankariyon kii jaanch karata he
 These include profile photos, group profile photos, and group information
 janj karke inhen hataaya jaataa he
 whatsapp also uses a tool called photodna, which Facebook uses
 iske tahat porn or abujiv image kii pahchaan kii jaati he or sambhavit watsap group yaa yugers jo ise share kar sakate hai unhen bain kiya jaataa he
 a whatsapp spokesperson said in a statement after the child pornography report, "whatsapp has a zero tolerance policy regarding child sexual abuse
 hamane apni sabase advanced technolji ko isse nipatane ke liye lagaaya he jisamen artificial intelligence shaamil he
 This profile scans photos and bans the accounts when in doubt
 hamen bharat or duusare deshon kii jaanch angesiyon ko bhi jawaab diya he
 As app stores and communication services are being used to spread abusive content, tech companies will have to work together to deal with it, '' a recent report said that through third party apps, whatsapp group's Name is being searched
 watsap ne iske riplai main kaha he ki watsap aisa koi feechar nahin detaa he jisase kisi third party ap se group ke bare main search kiya ja sake
 whatsapp's tool can also delete your account if you associate with such an illegal group
 chunki abhi koi bhi bina ijaajat aapako apane group main aid kar saktaa he, isliye aap saavdhaan rahen or aise acounts yaa grups ko report karen jo child pornography ke contant share karte hai

 Such is the fear of Naxalites in Orissa, that as soon as evening falls, many police stations here get locked
 koi pulisavaala ilaake main najar nahin aata
 Just think - in such a situation what will the Patnaik government fight with the Naxalites
 pulisavaale thane chhod gaerourakela kii kalunga police chaowkee, jahaan pulisavaale to dikhte nahin, balki ilaake ke log chaowkee par pahunche hue
 People are angry but even if they demonstrate dharna den bhi to kisi ko koi pareshaani nahin
 Because there is no one here
 logon kaa aarope behad sanjeeda he
 The policemen left the police station due to the fear of Naxalites, what will happen to the general public
 thanon par talagerikela thane par bhi taala lataka
 This is the condition of the police in many Naxal-affected districts of Odisha
 aap hairaan honge, lekin vajah jaan lijie
 How will policemen deal with Naxalites without weapons? apni jaan bachaa len, yahi kaaphi hoga
 Policemen do the same thing, that's why locks are seen at the police stations 
 mukhyamantri ke paas thos jawaab nahilekin mukhyamantri ke paas koi thos jawaab nahin
 Orissa Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik says that we have had many meetings at the state level
 ham halaat se niptenge taaki rajya kaa har naagarik surakshit rahe
 More than a hundred policemen were martyred in the last two years, more than a hundred policemen were martyred in Naxal attacks, crores of rupees were also received from the center in the name of Naxal problem, but the result has been locked in police stations
 uttar pradesh kii yogi adityanath sarkaar soobe main farji madrason ke khilaaf sakht kadam uthaane ja rahi he
 In the Saharanpur district alone, the names of 17 such fake madrasas have been revealed by the district administration recently
 ‘aaj tak’ ne ground jiro par jaakar aise madrason kaa reality check kiya, jo sarkaar kii manyata praapt list main to shaamil hai, lekin jinka jameen par kahin koi vajood nahin he
 750 Saharanpur and Deoband have 750 madrasas on the government's recognized list
 inamen prashasan kii ore se akele saharanpur main 17 madrason ko bairiphication ke baad farji paaya gaya
 In Aharanpur, 'aaj Tak' first moved to the village of Baliakhedi
 prashasan kii ore se saharanpur ke jo 17 farji madrason kii suchi jari kii gai thi, usamen ekamdaraseka pataa darj tha- ‘madrasa mujffar islamic academy, baliyakhedi
 'aaj Tak' in the village of Baliakheri could not find any identity of this madrasa anywhere
 jaanch ke dauraan logon ne bataaya ki yah madrasa to yahaan se band ho kar kisi or gaanv main shift ho chukaa he
 Some of the children of the village, who surprised the names of the teachers who taught on the madrasa, said that they had studied in this madrasa for two years
 bacchon ne us kathith madrase main padhaane vaale logon ke naam liye to wo hairaan karne vaala tha
 a girl studying in the alleged madrasa told that she was also taught by three women, whose names were Swati, Pooja and Chhavi
 madrason main amuman hindu shikshak nahin padhaate, kyonki vahaan zyaadaatar islamic talim hi di jaati he
 The madrasa, which had already been closed for a year, but the paper where the temple was claimed to be in the village of Chabalabhiakhedi, is present in the building, but there are no people living in it
 kathith madrase ko registerd karwaane vaale shaks sarfaraj ko bhi ‘aaj tak’ ne dhund nikaala
 Sarfaraz himself admitted that the madrasa had already closed a year
 saath hi usne daawa kiya ki is madrase ko duusari jagah isi naam se shuru kiya gaya he
 Also been online
 board tanga, lekin madrasa nahinfarji madrason ke reality check kaa aglaa mukaam tha saharanpur kaa shekhpura gaanv
 The name of the madrasa present at this place in the administration document is 'jamia Mairajul Uloom'
 shekhpura gaanv main vah imaarat mil gai, jahaan is madrase kaa board bhi tanga hua he
 Now the question arose here that if the madrasa exists, then why was it considered fake by the administration? To know the truth of the madrasa, when entering inside the building, a person named Shamsuddin was talked to
 ise bhi padhieh saharanpur main sirf kaagaj par chal rahe 17 madrase, manyata hui raddausane bataaya ki pehle is imaarat main skool kaa sanchaalan hota tha
 Later, the administration applied for the registration of the madrasa at this address
 maamle ko lekar madrase ko registerd karaane vaali mahila shaheen khan se bhi baat kii gai
 Shaheen has such documents, according to which the registration of this madrasa was done at this address in December 2013
 jab shaheen se poocha gaya ki veriphication ke dauraan yah madrasa sarkaar ko kyon nahin mila, is par shaheen kaa kahana tha ki prashasan kii ore se bheji gai chitthee hamaari gaiyr maujuudagi main waapas chali gai, jisaki vajah se ye sab hua
 Shaheen also told that in this madrasa, two Hindu children also study, this was a different thing than usual
 board madrase kaa, par chal rahaa skool'ajtak' ne reality check ke liye phir saharanpur ke khaataa khedi ilaake main madrasa islamic mahamudiya arabi farsi kaa rukh kiya
 The name of this madrasa is also included in the list of 17 fake madrasas issued by the administration
 pate vaali jagah par imaarat or us par board bhi laga mila
 On the board was written- MIM Arabic Persian Academy
 yahaan imaarat main maujuud ek shaks ne bataaya ki yahaan madrasa nahin, balki skool chalaaya ja rahaa he
 'aaj Tak' reached Khati's Madrasa Sir Didar to Arabic Persian under reality check
 yahaan imaarat bhi thi or us par madrase kaa board bhi laga tha
 The truth that was revealed here, he uncovered all the secrets of fake madrasas
 yahaan mohammad sharifuddin naam ke shaks se jab poocha gaya ki imaarat par madrase kaa board laga he, to madrasa kahaan he? is par sharifuddin ne bataaya ki yahaan skool chalaaya jaataa he, madrasa nahin
 Sharifuddin revealed on camera that a man had lured him with money and asked him to leave a part of the building with the board of the alleged madrasa
 imaaraton par madrase kaa board lagane ke liye diya jaataa he paise kaa lalchasharif uddin ne ajtak ke camere par yah khulaasa kiya ki kisi shaks ne unhen paise kaa laalach diya or unhen kaha ki vah is imaarat ke ek hisse par kathith madrase kaa takht laga kar chhod den
 It became clear after learning that such mafias are working to get government assistance in the name of madrasas, who lure people to pay money to put madrasa boards on their buildings
 farji madrason ke khilaaf hogi karrwaisaharanpur ke jiladhikari pike pandeya ko jab reality check kii jaankaree di gai, to unhone kaha, ‘’aapaki padtaal bilkul sahi he
 According to the report that i have, there is only a board of madrasas in those places, but the madrasas are not running there
 aisi jagahon ko chihnit kar liya gaya he
 The District Magistrate bluntly said that after the final report comes, strict action will be taken against these alleged madrassas and the people behind them
 inase na sirf sarkari anudaan kii rakam waapas vasuuli jaaegi, balki inke khilaaf exiaar bhi darj karai jaaegi

 Chief Information Commissioner Radhakrishna Mathur, while deciding the application of Indian Forest Service officer Sanjeev Chaturvedi, provided information about the proportion and value of black money brought from abroad during the tenure of the PMO Narendra Modi government, providing records of the efforts made in this regard Also instructed
 siaisi ke aadesh main PMO ko videsh se laaye gayi kaledhan se bhartiya nagarikon ke bank khaaton main sarkaar dwaara jamaa kii gai rakam ke bare main soochna kaa khulaasa karne ko kaha gaya he
 The Prime Minister's Office called Chaturvedi's questions regarding black money out of the definition of information
 lekin soochna ayukta ne yah daleel thukraa di
 Refusing pmo's reply, Mathur said, "PMO in its reply on question number four (black money brought from abroad) and question number five (amount of money brought from abroad to bank accounts of Indian citizens) from RTI application is incorrect
 It is said that the requests made by the applicant do not fall under the definition of information under Section 2 (f) of the RTI Act
 ’apane artiai aavedan main chaturvedi ne modi sarkaar kii mek in india, skill india, svachh bharat or smart city project jaisi vibhinn yojanaon ke bare main bhi suchanaaen maangi thi
 On not getting satisfactory reply from the PMO, Chaturvedi filed an appeal in the Central Information Commission, the highest appellate body on RTI matters
 sunwaayee ke dauraan chaturvedi ne ayog se kaha ki unhone kendriya mantriyon ke khilaaf pradhanmantri ko saunpi gai shikayaton kii satyapit pratiyon ke sambandh main vishesh soochna maangi he jo unhen uplabdh karai jaani chahie
 Mathur said, 'the commission says that the PMO has corrected the appellant on the RTI application's question number 1B (complaints of corruption against ministers) and question number 4,5,12,13 (in relation to corruption in AIIMS) and Specific answer / information not given
 'sanjeev pehle bhi kar chuke hai khulaaseayog ne PMO ko akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) ke adhikariyon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope or usamen kendriya swasthya mantri kii kathith bhoomika ko lekar sanjeev chaturvedi dwaara likhe gayi patr par kii gai karrwai kaa khulaasa karne kaa bhi nirdesh diya
 Chaturvedi had earlier raised the issue of alleged corruption and afforestation scam in the previous Congress government of Haryana

 He had appealed to the central government after allegedly being a victim of harassment at the hands of the state government

 Attending 'agenda Aaj Tak', Madhuri Dixit Nene said that she never believed in the 'number game'
 'agenda ajtak' ke duusare din kaa 7waan satr behad dilachasp rahaa
 After all, why not? is satr kii vaktaa 'dhak dhak girl' maadhuri dikshit jo thim
 The session is named 'heroine no less than Heroine' which fits Madhuri perfectly
 satr kii shuruyaat main to maadhuri ke kariyar se judi baaten huin, phir sawaal-jawaab kaa daur chalaa, jisamen logon ne maadhuri ke dream role, unke jivan kii rochak baaten or unki aane vaali filmon ke bare main jaananaa chaha
 After this, a round of praise for Madhuri started
 vaise to maadhuri kii tarif main kai logon ne kaside gadhe, lekin geetkaar javed akhtar ke shabdon par na keval maadhuri, balki puri mehfil hi muskura uthi
 Javed Sahab praised Madhuri and said that Bollywood did not make full use of Madhuri's acting ability
 unhone kaha ki maadhuri kii yogyata ke hisaab se kabhi unhen role nahin mili, lekin jo bhi role unhen mili, usamen unhone behtareen kaam karke dikhaaya, jo maadhuri kii uplabdhi he
 During the discussion in the agenda, Madhuri Dixit said that the dominance of women is increasing even behind the camera
 unhone kaha ki mahilaon kii chhavi badali he, jo 'silver screen' par najar aati he
 It was learned in the conversation that Shriram Nene was impressed at the beginning by seeing Madhuri's fame
 maadhuri ne kaha, 'main or mere pati ek team hai
 My husband and i jointly decided to return to India
 'maadhuri dikshit ne kaha ki kalakaar ko samaaj ke liye yogadan karte rahanaa chahie
 Madhuri said, 'I will keep working for social service too

 ' jeeyo ne band kii of net free collinggrahakon ne tri se maanga jald samadhaninterconect yuses charge yani IUC ke chalate jeeyo ne 9 oktober ko of net free colling ko khatm karne kaa faisla kiya he
 In such a situation, when the burden of IUC came to the customers, they have sought a solution from TRAI at the earliest
 jeeyo ke graahakon ne tri tak apni maang pahunchane ke liye online yachika daayar kii he
 In fact, in 2017, IUC charge was fixed at 6 paise per minute by TRAI and it was said that it will be abolished by 1 January 2020
 isaki vajah se jeeyo ne colling free kar diya tha
 But recently, TRAI has sought a consultation paper related to the IUC for review and there is a possibility that its duration may be extended
 aise main ye saaf nahin he ki IUC ke chargeej kab tak khatm honge or isi ke chalate jeeyo par dabaav badhane laga or company ne of-net free colling band karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Also, Jio has also said that IUC will make the calling again once the charges are over
 vahiin duusari taraf vodaphone-idia or airtel ne ye saaf kar diya he ki wo graahakon ke liye analimited plance main of net free colling jari rakhenge
 Whereas Jio announced on October 9 that now customers will have to pay 6 paise per minute for making calls from Jio's network to other networks
 isi bich jab IUC charge kaa boj graahakon par aayaa to unhone tri tak apni maang pahunchane ke liye online yachika daayar kii he
 According to the information received, so far more than 10 thousand customers have supported TRAI and demanded an early decision on IUC from TRAI
 reliance jeeyo kaa kahana he ki company apni shuruyaat se hi free colling kii suvidha de rahi thi, lekin iske liye use baari keemat chukaani padati he
 The reasons that are coming out are being told that the tariff plans for Airtel and vodafone-idea's lower middle class have higher calling rates
 inamen se zyaadaatar graahak 2G network se jude hai or jo mobile kaa istemaal khaastaur par colling ke liye karte hai
 In such a situation, these customers give missed calls to Jio's customers to save money and when Jio's customers call in another network, the company has to pay 6 paise per minute

 On Monday, Priyanka will start her campaign through a boat trip from Prayagraj, which will end in Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 apni is yatra se pehle priyanka gandhi ne janata ke naam ek khulaa khat likhaa he

 upi ke logon se meraa naata bahut purana he or aaj sabake saath milakar upi kii raajnneeti badalane kii jimmedaari mujhe ek sipaahi ke rup main mili he
 Priyanka said, 'there can not be change without listening to you, so i am reaching your door
 main jalmaarg, bas, train or padayatra kar aapse sampark karuungi
 "ganga ji ka sahara" In her letter, Priyanka Gandhi described Ganga as a symbol of truth and equality and said that she does not discriminate anyone
 unhone kaha, 'gangaji uttar pradesh kaa sahaara hai
 i will reach among you with the help of Gangaji
 'bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ne varanasi main kaha tha ki main aayaa nahin hum, mujhe maa ganga ne bulaayaa he
 After the formation of the government at the center, a separate ministry was also formed for cleaning Ganga
 haalanki, ab tak ganga safai ko lekar vipaksh sarkaar par bargalane kaa aarope lagaataa rahaa he
 In such a situation, Priyanka Gandhi is now going to PM Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi through Ganga Yatra, where she will communicate with the people of the villages along the river
 sutron ke mutabik, kaha ye bhi ja rahaa he ki priyanka kii is boat yatra ke peeche yah bhi ek vajah ho sakati he, jisaki baangi unke chunaav prachaar main dekhne ko mil sakati he
 The Rajasthan government in the Supreme Court held that 115 of Aravalli
 34 hectare kshetra main avaidh khanan nahin ho rahaa he
 On behalf of the Rajasthan government, it has been said that through satellite images they have to see how many areas have been illegally mined
 tippaniyan The government said that 27 percent work has been completed so far and it will take 3 months more time to complete it
 pichhali sunwaayee main court main rajasthan sarkaar ne ye sweekaar kiya tha ki aravali kii 138 main se 28 pahadiyaan gaayab ho chuki hai
 Court sent Chief Secretary of State to Aravali 115 within 48 hours
 34 hectare kshetra main avaidh khanan rukvane ke aadesh die the
 The court said that it has been forced to give this order because the Rajasthan government has taken the matter very lightly
 sarkaar ne kaha ki abhi tak 27 pratishat kaam puraa hua he or isko puraa hone main 3 maheene kaa samay or lagegaa
 In the previous hearing, the Rajasthan government had accepted in the court that 28 of the 138 Aravalli hills had disappeared
 court ne rajya ke mukhya sachiv ko 48 ghante ke bheetar aravali ke 115
 Orders were ordered to stop illegal mining in an area of 34 hectares
 court ne kaha ki vah yah aadesh dene ke liye majaboor ho gaya he kyonki rajasthan sarkaar ne is maamle ko bahut hi halke main liya he
 The court said that it has been forced to give this order because the Rajasthan government has taken the matter very lightly
 unnav rape cese main aaropee bijepi vidhayak kuldeep singh senger kii sitapur jail ke bheetar kii gatividhiyon kii jaanch hogi
 The victim's family has accused the MLA of speaking to his people over the phone from inside the jail

 The police have registered a case of murder and conspiracy to murder Kuldeep Singh Sengar
 iske baad rajya sarkaar ne kuldeep singh senger kii jail ko badalane kaa bhi man banaaya he lekin is par abhi koi faisla nahin hua he
 Let me tell you, Kuldeep Singh Sengar is an undertrial prisoner
 lihaaja jail badalane kaa faisla lene kaa adhikaar rajya sarkaar ko he
 Significantly, an FIR has been lodged against the BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar, his brother Manoj Sengar and eight others in a road accident case
 is durghatana main unnav dushkarm peedita or unke vakil gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaye the, jabaki is haadase main unki do mahila rishtedaaron kii maut ho gai thi

 The rape victim's mother claimed that the accident was a plot to eliminate her daughter and others

 49 percent of people in India Today's mood survey said that only non-gandhi and non-dynastic leaders can make the Congress stand up
 magar jab is grand old party main jaan phoonk sakane vaale sambhavit netaa kaa naam poocha gaya, to 15 fisad ne priyanka gandhi or 11 fisad ne rahul gandhi main hi bharosa jataayaa
 These contradictory answers perhaps better illustrate the lack of alternative leadership in Congress
 may main loksabhaa chunaav main party kii lagaataar duusari haar ke baad kaa ghatnakram bataata he ki congress ke paas gandhi parivaar ke alaava na koi ranneeti he or na koi siyaasi afasana
 Thoughts of new and young leadership arose in the party, but then the Congress think-tank finally found shelter in the Gandhi family itself
 rahul ne 25 may ko adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya tha
 For the next 75 days, the Congress Working Committee could not understand what to do next
 uski pratikriya yahi thi ki puri party rahul ko istipha waapas lene ke liye manaane main jute gai or jab unhen nahin manaa saki to sonia ke charnon main ja giri
 Rahul took over the reins of the party in December 2017 after Sonia's two-decade-old rule at the helm of the party
 baaise maheene baad sonia ne phir bete kii jagah le lee he or party ke nayaa adhyaksh chunane tak antarim adhyaksh ban gai hai
 So what does the return of Sonia to the summit mean for the Congress? Everything will go on as before
 disambar 2017 main rahul ke adhyaksh banane se pehle party main do satta centre the—10 janpath or 12 tughlaq road, yani kramash: sonia or rahul ke ghar
 There were two factions in the party which were associated with one of these and they often clashed over a lot of issues
 disambar 2017 ke baad aise kai netaa darkinar ho gaye jinaki apni koi rajnatik puunji nahin thi, par mahaj sonia ke prati vafadari kii vajah se party main taqatvar bane hue the
 Most of them will have a roar again, although Team Rahul is unlikely to back down
 beete do maheene ke ghatnakram ko ishaara maane, to rahul or unki team is ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he ki rahul ko congress kii takalifdeh viraasat—yani vanshavaadi raajnneeti or bhrashtachar ke aaropon se daagdar upie sarkaar—se alag or asambaddha kiya jaae
 Sonia's return has ruined one of Rahul's most important motives, which he wanted to resign and to seek — that the modi-bjp accusation of his dynasty being invalidated
 desh kaa mizaaj survey ke nattejey bataate hai ki vanshavaadi raajnneeti ke khilaaf bhagava party kaa afasana kaamyaab hua he—65 fisadi logon kaa kahana he ki matadaataaon ne vanshavaadi raajnneeti ko nirnaayak taur par khaarij kar diya he
 Rahul realized this long ago; On 25 May, he had not imagined the possibility that his mother would become the president
 do maukon par unhone saaf kaha tha ki party ke sheersh pad par gandhi parivaar kaa koi vyakti nahin baithegaa
 Not only this, returning to the pre-december 2017 era, there is no possibility that the party will find a way out of the internal and external crisis before it
 satta ke do kendron or unke sipahasalaron kii ek duusare se ulti kaaryastylee ke chalate party main nirnay lene kii raftaar or dhimi hogi
 Also, a third power center is also emerging in the party — around Priyanka, the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh
 lihaaja, party ke bheetar uljhan or afasarshahi ke or badaae ke asaar hai
 That too when the Congress has to take on the BJP, which has taken deep roots and has a strong electoral machinery, in an India where Hindu nationalist sentiments are at its top
 bhaajapa ne anuchhed 370 ke tahat kashmir kaa vishesh darja ek jatke main khatm kar diya or us par vipaksh kii pratikriya halki or bedam hi rahi
 This will further strengthen the perception that BJP is a strong decision-making party
 bhaajapa se mukaable ke liye party sanghathan or vichaardhaara donon ke str par kamjor he
 Therefore, it also seems to be poor in terms of electoral challenges
 hakeekat yah he ki beete do maheenon main congress vichaaron se diwalia or ekajute dhang se kaam kar paane main naakaara party ke taur par desh ke saamne ai he
 The Congress elected West Bengal Lok Sabha MP Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, despite the fact that Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tiwari were fluent leaders
 saaf taur par party ke pratham parivaar ke prati vafadari yahaan bhi duusari sab chizon par baari padi
 Worse, there were two unintended consequences of making Chaudhary the leader of the opposition
 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke katu aalochak choudhary ko na sirf oonchi kursi di gai balki sonia ne khulkar unki tarif bhi kii—congress sansadeey dal kii baithak main unhen bengal tiger ke taur par milwaaya gaya
 This widened the gap between Mamata's Trinamool Congress and the Congress
 sach to yah he ki mamata desh kaa mizaaj survey main 19 fisadi logon ke samarthan ke saath vipakshi dalon ke chehre ke taur par rahul kii jagah lene vaali netaa banakar ubhari hai
 The Congress had failed to form an alliance with any other important anti-bjp party other than the DMK, NCP and RJD for the Lok Sabha elections
 congress ke ek rajyasabha sadsy kehete hai, ''in partiyon kii agua ke taur par ubharna to dur, hamen un partiyon kii taraf se, jo abhi bhaajapa kii aguai vaale endie kaa hissaa nahin hai, yaa to chunautiyaan mil rahi hai yaa berukhi
 Even AAP, BJD and TDP supported BJP on Article 370
 ''alaakaman kii taraf se saaf nirdesh nahin milane ke kaaran party ko sansad main sharmindagi jhelni padi
 When the discussion was on to abolish Article 370 in the Lok Sabha, Chaudhary called it a two-way issue between India and Pakistan
 sonia or rahul hairaan rah gaye
 Leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia or Deepender Hooda, who spoke in a rough manner, also gave statements against the party's stand on Article 370
 isi gadabadjhaale ke chalate netaaon ke party chhodkar jane kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya

 He resigned on the same day that the bill to weaken Article 370 and divide Jammu and Kashmir into two parts was introduced in the Rajya Sabha
 unhone sankalp or vidheyak ke khilaaf matdaan karne ke liye party sadasyon ko vip jari karne se inkaar kar diya or istipha de diya
 It will not be easy for Sonia to salvage the party
 unhen or unke bharosemand ahamed patel ko lagegaa ki is tajurbe se ve pehle bhi guzar chuke hai
 Two decades ago, when the party was disintegrating under the leadership of Sitaram Kesari, Patel created an atmosphere in favor of Sonia on the basis of maneuver
 agle 20 saal party unheen ke irdagird kaam karti rahi or usne kisi bhi badi tut kii naubat nahin aane di
 The 72-year-old leader, who is suffering from diseases, is the last hope of the Congress, this is not an auspicious sign for a party rich with a magnificent legacy

 Pakistani media has described the incident of the death of Indian citizen Kulbhushan Jadhav as a death sentence for espionage in Pakistan
 vahiin jaankaar log is faisle ke kootnithik dushprinaamon par dhyaan dilaa rahe hai
 In fact, a military court in Pakistan convicted Jadhav for espionage and subversive activities and sentenced him to death
 sena kii media shakha ne kal ek bayaan main kaha ki yah sajaa field general court marshall ne sunaayi or sena pramukh general qamar javed bajva ne isaki pushti kii hai 
 Newspapers printed in Pakistan wrote the right-wing English-speaking newspaper Nation in its headline on its front page titled Death to Spy Spikes Tension (detective Sentencing Deaths Are Increasing Tension)
 High-profile Indian spies sentenced to death by increasing tension
 akhbaar ne raajnneetik evam raksha visheshgy dow
 Hassan Askari wrote that the decision to hang Jadhav will further increase the tension between the two countries
 ascari ne kaha, sena ne sakht sajaa di he jo pakistani kanoon ke mutabik he
 He said, but we have to see whether Pakistan can withstand its political and diplomatic ramifications
 da neshnapar nava-e-vakt samooh kaa malikana haq he, jo paramparaagat rup se pakistani sansthaanon se judaa he or ise bharat ke mukhar aalochak ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 Other newspapers have also published this news prominently and most have focused on the sentence given to the alleged detective
 da express tribyoonne apane panne par self kanfesd indian spai awarded deth centens (swaghoshit bhartiya jasoos ko maut kii sajaa) sheershak se khabar di he or is faisle ko abhootpurv bataaya he
 In its report, this decision has raised fears of an immediate bitter political dispute between the two hostile neighbors
 report main kaha gaya he ki jadhav hossain mubarak patel ke naam se pakistan main gupt tareeke se rahakar sanchaalan kar rahaa tha
 Pakistan's leading newspaper has described the decision as a rare step
 akhbaar ne kaha ki yah faisla aise vakt main saamne aayaa he jab pakistan or bharat ke bich pehle se tanaav jari he
 The newspaper published the news in full column and also gave the opinion of the experts on the verdict
 iske anusaar kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki bharat kii pratikriya majboot he jabaki anya is baat par kaayam rahe ki isse sambandh main koi naatakeey badlaav nahin hoga
 At the same time, the newspaper quoted Lt Gen (retd) Talat Masood as saying, for a long time Pakistan has been struggling to prove that India has a hand in Pakistan's instability
 maamle main madad maangane ke liye hamaare rajdoot kai desh gayi lekin kuch bhi haath nahin aayaa
 Now we have taken our step, that's fine

 On June 6 last year, police fired on the agitating farmers in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, in which five farmers were killed
 ab soshal media par ek video viral ho rahaa he jisamen ye daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki kisaanon par police kii golibari kaa video he
 So is this really the same video? a farmer-friendly government shootout in Mandsaur city of Madhya Pradesh
 
 See how the bjp government of Madhya Pradesh had shown its cruelty to innocent farmers
 
 The farmers were asking for their legitimate demands from this cruel government, what did this government give to those farmers in return for those demands

 com / fuujbvcn30— SONI (@maheshs03969081)july 12, 2018darasal jo video soshal media par viral ho rahaa he usamen dikhaai de rahaa he ki bich sadak par teen pulisavaale bandook taane sadak par pojishan liye hue hai, sadak ke donon taraf logon kii bheed he or saamne se naare lagaate hue ek jattha police kii taraf bad rahaa he
 Then the three policemen shoot the gun directly towards the crowd and 2-3 people are shot and they fall on the road
 sadak par dhuaan uthta he or bheed teetar-bitar ho jaati he
 After this some policemen move forward and an ambulance also comes from behind
 pulisavaale strechar par ladakar ghayal logon ko ambulance main le jaati he
 The video is such that anyone can be shocked by seeing it
 sirf ek minute ke is video clip ko is vakt soshal media par jor-shor se viral kiya ja rahaa he or is video ko mandsaur jile kaa golicond bataaya ja rahaa he or kaha ja rahaa he ki kisaan apni maangon ke liye sangharsh kar rahe the lekin police ne unhen sidhe maut kii neend sula diya
 The death of 5 farmers in the Mandsaur firing case
 Let us know that the firing that took place in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh a year ago, was in the news and 5 farmers died in it
 is ghatana kii kaaphi charchaa hui thi or bijepi ko ise lekar kaaphi fajihat bhi jhelni padi thi, lekin kya yah viral video sachmuch madhya pradesh ke mandsaur golicond kaa hi he?is video ko dhyaan se dekhne par kuch chijen khud-ba-khud saaf ho jaati hai
 The first thing seems to be that even when the police are firing, people are standing comfortably on both sides of the road
 goli chalane or logon ke girane ke baad bhi bheed vahaan se bhaagti hui nahin dikhti jaisaa ki aamtaur par hota he
 It can also be seen clearly that after firing, smoke is rising not from the place of gun but from around
 saath hi jo aawaaj ai wo bhi goli jaisi nahin balki pataakhe jaisi lag rahi he
 This is the reality of the viral video
 When the policemen stand by the bullet, there is still an explosion and smoke appears on the street which is clear that it is a cracker
 yah baat bhi hairaan karne vaali he ki logon ke girane ke fouran baad hi vahaan ambulance pahunch jaati he or log strechar lekar daud padate hai, jaise vah pehle se hi maukey par tainaat hon
 In view of all these things, it becomes clear that it is not the actual firing of the police but the mock drill which the police often conduct to spread awareness among the people
 puri tarah isaki sachai parakhane ke liye 'ajtak' ne mandsaur main apane samvaadadaata se sampark kiya to unhone bataaya ki mandsaur golicond jis jagah par hua tha vahaan par koi bazaar nahin tha balki khet the
 Where the Mandsaur bullet incident took place was a village whereas in this video it can be clearly seen that it is a market of a city where banks, showrooms and hotels are seen on both sides
 isse yah baat bilkul saaf he ki yah mandsaur kii video to bilkul nahin he
 Mandsaur is not a video of Khunti, but this is a video of police firing
 In order to investigate where we are, we started searching on the basis of all the showrooms and shops seen in this video, after which we came to know this video of Khunti city of Jharkhand
 is
 khunti main pichley saal 31 oktober ko police ne danga se nipatane ke liye police kii taiyaari ke bare main ek mock drill kiya tha
 Peg officials confirmed this

 But before the matter becomes known, let us know about the two Sadhvis who testified for 15-16 years, fought against all the pressures
 aaj kii hinsa ke str se aap samaj gaye honge ki un ladakiyon par kya guzari hogi
 Journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, who took out a newspaper named 'poor Sach', printed the full truth of the dera and the anonymous letter in his newspaper which had written about rape and sexual violence of two sadhvis
 yah gumnaam patr us vakt ke pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bheja gaya tha
 Shortly after printing, Chhatrapati ji was attacked and killed
 do sadhviyon ke bhai ranjit kii bhi hatya ho gai
 a journalist died for the truth
 kya aap kisi bhi netaa ko jaanate hai jo vot lene ke liye deraa main jane se pehle chhatrapati kii ladaai main saath dene ke liye gaya ho
 We spoke to Chhatrapati's son Anshul Chhatrapati, who is very concerned about his safety at the moment
 ram chander chhatrapati, ek hansata muskuraataa saahasik patrkaar bich shahar main maar diya gaya
 Anshul said that once he decided to fight and came out of the house, many good people met on the way
 lekharaj dhont, ashvini bakshi, ares cheema or raajen sachhar jaise vakeelon ne bina paise ke cese ladaa
 Even with all the pressures, we and the Sadhvi's side supported
 yahi nahin sibiai ke jabanz dspi satish dagar na hote to yah cese apane mukaam par nahin pahunch paata
 Satish Dagar prepared the Sadhvis mentally
 ek ladki kaa sasuraal deraa kaa samarthak tha, jab use pataa chalaa ki usne gavaahi di ho to ghar se nikaal diya
 Even after this, the girls continued to face all kinds of pressures and the fear of the crowd
 satish dagar nahin hote ye log khauf kaa saamana nahin kar pate
 Anshul said that there was a lot of pressure on Satish Dagar but he did not bow down
 bade-bade ipies aisi himmat nahin juta pate hai magar dspi satish dagar ne kamaal kaa saahas dikhaaya he
 Anshul told that earlier the CBI court from Panchkula was in Ambala
 jab ye log vahaan sunwaayee ke liye jate the tab vahaan bhi baba ke samarthakon kii bheed aatank paidaa kar detii thi
 The condition became that on the day when the hearing was held and Baba was produced, on that day a temporary court was made in the sp's office within the Ambala police line
 chhavnee ke baahar samarthakon kaa hujum hota tha
 In such a situation, those two sadhwis testified and stood firm, not an easy thing against the Baba whom big leaders of Congress, Amit Shah of BJP, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Cabinet of Haryana used to go to salute there
 jabaki ye netaa mahilaon kii suraksha ke naam par chunaav ladate hai
 Did he support the Sadhvi? tippaniyan How to wrap a 15-year story in ten minutes
 bahut lambii he
 Anshul's condition is that a gunman was found
 puure rajya main itani tainaati ho gai magar kisi ko khyaal nahin aayaa ki anshul chhatrapati ke ghar kii suraksha badha di jaae
 Also met the police but did not get results
 faisla aane ke baad jab media ne baat uthaai to ab unke ghar ke baahar kuch surakshakarmi tainaat hai
 Later, when the CBI court shifted to Panchkula, Anshul Chhatrapati traveled with a gunman, traveling 250 km from Sirsa to Panchkula and Gurmeet Singh Ram Rahim testified through video conferencing in the same Sirsa court
 ye he aam aadmi kii haalat
 If the punjab-haryana High Court had no order today, you would have nothing to believe that the government is strictly dealing with this mob on violence
 hoicourt kii tippanee bhi kam sakht nahin he
 Who is responsible for this chaos? aapane khud hi logon ko ye sab karne diya he
 Why did you allow the crowd to gather in Panchkula
 ye afisar mookadarshak kyon bane hue hai
 You are helping them yourself

 The same happened during the Jat movement
 jab tak aadesh paas hua, nuksaan ho chukaa tha

 The court also pulled up the central government and said that we hope that you will come forward and help the people of Panchkula

 The High Court's comment was growing from harsh to harsh
 punjab-haryana hoicourt ne kaha ki deraa sachcha sauda kii sampatti zabt kii jaae

 unki takat ke aage sabhi raajnneetik dal ke bade netaa sar jhukaate hai
 If elections are to be held, the dera will again go for a round
 gurmeet singh ram rahim ke saath kai netaaon kii tasviir twitor or soshal media par chal rahi hai
 Chief Minister Khattar is sweeping with him under the cleanliness drive
 jab bheed media ke obi vine main aag laga rahi thi tab police vahaan chupchaap khadi rahi
 Several OB vans parked in front of government offices were overturned by supporters and burnt
 enditivi kii bhi obi vine puri tarah jal gai or ejeeniyar kaa paanv tut gaya
 Meanwhile, reporters and cameraman of PTC channel in Sirsa were attacked by supporters
 inkaa haath tut gaya or sahyogi cameraman laapata ho gaya
 whatsapp, Internet services were closed, even after this, the media somehow sent the photos to you
 magar sochie ki kya-kya tasviren aap tak nahin pahunchi hongi
 In Panchkula, people did not allow journalists to enter the house
 sena, ardhsainik bal or police bal kii tainaati kaa koi phayda nahin hua
 Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar continued to appeal for peace, just as there is an appeal to maintain peace and goodwill during holi-diwali
 farvari, 2016 ke jat andolan ke samay bhi aisi hi bheed bekaabu ho gai thi
 After that a report was also submitted under the chairmanship of Prakash Singh but the action was done in the name of Khan
 is report ko padhenge to aaj kii hinsa ko behatar tareeke se samaj sakenge
 You will be able to see why even after the deployment of police and paramilitary forces, the crowd makes up its mind
 jat andolan ke vakt haryana main 1,196 dukaane jala di gayi thim
 371 vehicles were burnt
 53 marriage pales or hotalon ko jala diya gaya
 23 petrol pumps damaged

 According to the report of the Prakash Singh Committee, 7,232 trees were cut in Haryana at that time so that the roads could be blocked
 farvari 2016 kii yah tasviir agast, 2017 kii tasviir se alag nahin he
 Prakash Singh has said in his report that despite the deployment of 6,332 security forces in Rohtak district, nothing was done to stop the violence
 rajya main suraksha balon kii tainaati to paryaapt thi magar ection lene kii ichha shakti nazar nahin aati
 Prakash Singh has written that there was no leadership at all levels
 kuch afasar duty se hi bhaag gaye
 Some did nothing while on duty
 afasaron kaa samooh aisa tha jo apni jati kii vafadari nibhaa rahe the, kanoon kii vafadari nahin nibhaa rahe the
 These people allowed the rioters to commit violence
 prakaash singh ne likhaa he ki haryana police ne 11 jagahon par lathi charge kii magar koi ghayal nahin hua
 Prakash Singh points out that the lathi charge has also become quite non-violent
 unhone bataaya he ki firing kii 20 ghatana huin jisamen 9 log maare gaye
 There was 9 firing in Rohtak but no one died
 saaf he ki prashasan jatiyon main bant gaya tha or dangaiyon ko bachaa rahaa tha
 Prakash Singh has written in his report that the Haryana Police has not used force in the last decade
 wo bhul gai he force kaa istamaal karnaa
 After all, on whom should the police officers of that government take action, from whose head to the minister, everyone should attend the camp
 lekin iske pehle ki baat anijani ho jaae un do sadhviyon ke bare main jaan len jinhone 15-16 saal tak gavaahi di, tamaam dabaavon ke bich ladaa

 Do you know any leader who went to join the battle of Chhatrapati before going to the Dera to get votes

 Ram Chander Chhatrapati, a laughing smiling adventure journalist was killed in the beach town
 anshul ne bataaya ki ek baar jab ladane kaa faisla kar ghar se nikle to raste main bahut se achche log mili
 Lawyers like Lekhraj Dhont, Ashwini Bakshi, RS Cheema and Rajen Sachar fought the case without money
 tamaam dabaavon ke baad bhi hamaara or sadhvio kaa hi saath diya
 Not only this, if the CBI had no DSP Satish Dagar, this case would not have reached its mark
 satish dagar ne hi sadhviyon ko maansik rup se taiyaar kiya
 a girl's in-law was a supporter of Dera, who was expelled from the house when she came to know that she had testified
 iske baad bhi ladkiyaan tamaam tarah ke dabaavon or bheed ke khauf kaa saamana karti raheen

 There was so much deployment across the state, but no one thought that the security of Anshul Chhatrapati's house should be increased

 Some officers fled from duty
 kuch ne duty par hote hue bhi kuch nahin kiya
 There was a group of officers who were practicing the loyalty of their caste, not the loyalty of the law
 in logon ne dangaiyon ko hinsa karne kii chhot di
 Prakash Singh has written that the Haryana Police charged lathi at 11 places but no one was injured
 prakaash singh tanj karte hai ki lathi charge bhi kaaphi ahimsak ho gai he
 He has said that there were 20 firing incidents in which 9 people were killed
 rohtak main 9 baar firing hui magar koi nahin mara
 It is clear that the administration was divided into castes and was saving the rioters
 prakaash singh ne apni report main likhaa he ki pichley ek dashak main haryana police ne force kaa hi istamaal nahin kiya he
 She has forgotten to use force
 aakhir us sarkaar kii police ke afasar kiske bharose ection len, jiske mukhiya se lekar mantri tak sab deraa main haaziri lagaate hon
 But before the matter becomes known, let us know about the two Sadhvis who testified for 15-16 years, fought against all the pressures
 aaj kii hinsa ke str se aap samaj gaye honge ki un ladakiyon par kya guzari hogi
 Journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, who took out a newspaper named 'poor Sach', printed the full truth of the dera and the anonymous letter in his newspaper which had written about rape and sexual violence of two sadhvis
 yah gumnaam patr us vakt ke pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bheja gaya tha
 Shortly after printing, Chhatrapati ji was attacked and killed
 do sadhviyon ke bhai ranjit kii bhi hatya ho gai
 a journalist died for the truth
 kya aap kisi bhi netaa ko jaanate hai jo vot lene ke liye deraa main jane se pehle chhatrapati kii ladaai main saath dene ke liye gaya ho
 We spoke to Chhatrapati's son Anshul Chhatrapati, who is very concerned about his safety at the moment
 ram chander chhatrapati, ek hansata muskuraataa saahasik patrkaar bich shahar main maar diya gaya
 Anshul said that once he decided to fight and came out of the house, many good people met on the way
 lekharaj dhont, ashvini bakshi, ares cheema or raajen sachhar jaise vakeelon ne bina paise ke cese ladaa
 Even with all the pressures, we and the Sadhvi's side supported
 yahi nahin sibiai ke jabanz dspi satish dagar na hote to yah cese apane mukaam par nahin pahunch paata
 Satish Dagar prepared the Sadhvis mentally
 ek ladki kaa sasuraal deraa kaa samarthak tha, jab use pataa chalaa ki usne gavaahi di ho to ghar se nikaal diya
 Even after this, the girls continued to face all kinds of pressures and the fear of the crowd
 satish dagar nahin hote ye log khauf kaa saamana nahin kar pate
 Anshul said that there was a lot of pressure on Satish Dagar but he did not bow down
 bade-bade ipies aisi himmat nahin juta pate hai magar dspi satish dagar ne kamaal kaa saahas dikhaaya he
 Anshul told that earlier the CBI court from Panchkula was in Ambala
 jab ye log vahaan sunwaayee ke liye jate the tab vahaan bhi baba ke samarthakon kii bheed aatank paidaa kar detii thi
 The condition became that on the day when the hearing was held and Baba was produced, on that day a temporary court was made in the sp's office within the Ambala police line
 chhavnee ke baahar samarthakon kaa hujum hota tha
 In such a situation, those two sadhwis testified and stood firm, not an easy thing against the Baba whom big leaders of Congress, Amit Shah of BJP, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Cabinet of Haryana used to go to salute there
 jabaki ye netaa mahilaon kii suraksha ke naam par chunaav ladate hai
 Did he support the Sadhvi? tippaniyan How to wrap a 15-year story in ten minutes
 bahut lambii he
 Anshul's condition is that a gunman was found
 puure rajya main itani tainaati ho gai magar kisi ko khyaal nahin aayaa ki anshul chhatrapati ke ghar kii suraksha badha di jaae
 Also met the police but did not get results
 faisla aane ke baad jab media ne baat uthaai to ab unke ghar ke baahar kuch surakshakarmi tainaat hai
 Later, when the CBI court shifted to Panchkula, Anshul Chhatrapati traveled with a gunman, traveling 250 km from Sirsa to Panchkula and Gurmeet Singh Ram Rahim testified through video conferencing in the same Sirsa court
 ye he aam aadmi kii haalat
 If the punjab-haryana High Court had no order today, you would have nothing to believe that the government is strictly dealing with this mob on violence
 hoicourt kii tippanee bhi kam sakht nahin he
 Who is responsible for this chaos? aapane khud hi logon ko ye sab karne diya he
 Why did you allow the crowd to gather in Panchkula
 ye afisar mookadarshak kyon bane hue hai
 You are helping them yourself
 unke samarthak paidal hi aa rahe hai or pakad bhi nahin paa rahe hai
 The same happened during the Jat movement
 jab tak aadesh paas hua, nuksaan ho chukaa tha
 Is Panchkula a part of India
 yah tak puch diya adaalat ne
 The court also pulled up the central government and said that we hope that you will come forward and help the people of Panchkula
 yaa phir kahie ki panchkula bharat kaa hissaa he yaa nahin
 The High Court's comment was growing from harsh to harsh
 punjab-haryana hoicourt ne kaha ki deraa sachcha sauda kii sampatti zabt kii jaae
 To compensate the loss from that
 lekin rajya ke mukhya sachiv kehete rahe ki nuksaan kii bharpai sarkaar karegi
 Prakash Singh has written in his report that the Haryana Police has not used force in the last decade
 wo bhul gai he force kaa istamaal karnaa
 After all, on whom should the police officers of that government take action, from whose head to the minister, everyone should attend the camp
 lekin iske pehle ki baat anijani ho jaae un do sadhviyon ke bare main jaan len jinhone 15-16 saal tak gavaahi di, tamaam dabaavon ke bich ladaa
 From today's level of violence you must have understood what will happen to those girls
 'puraa sach' naam kaa akhbaar nikaale vaale patrkaar ram chander chhatrapati ne deraa kaa puraa sach or us gumnaam patr ko apane akhbaar main chhap diya jisamen do sadhviyon ke saath balaatkaar or yon hinsa kii baat likhi thi
 This anonymous letter was sent to the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 chhapane ke kuch hi samay ke bheetar chhatrapati ji par hamalaa hua or unki maut ho gai
 Ranjith, the brother of two sages, was also killed
 ek patrkaar ne sach ke liye jaan de di
 Do you know any leader who went to join the battle of Chhatrapati before going to the Dera to get votes
 hamane chhatrapati ke putr anshul chhatrapati se baat kii jo is vakt apni suraksha ko lekar kaaphi chintit hai
 Ram Chander Chhatrapati, a laughing smiling adventure journalist was killed in the beach town
 anshul ne bataaya ki ek baar jab ladane kaa faisla kar ghar se nikle to raste main bahut se achche log mili
 Lawyers like Lekhraj Dhont, Ashwini Bakshi, RS Cheema and Rajen Sachar fought the case without money
 tamaam dabaavon ke baad bhi hamaara or sadhvio kaa hi saath diya
 Not only this, if the CBI had no DSP Satish Dagar, this case would not have reached its mark
 satish dagar ne hi sadhviyon ko maansik rup se taiyaar kiya
 a girl's in-law was a supporter of Dera, who was expelled from the house when she came to know that she had testified
 iske baad bhi ladkiyaan tamaam tarah ke dabaavon or bheed ke khauf kaa saamana karti raheen
 Satish is not a dagger, these people are not able to face the fear
 anshul ne bataaya ki satish dagar par bhi bahut dabaav padaa magar ve nahin jhuke
 Big IPS are unable to muster such courage but DSP Satish Dagar has shown amazing courage
 anshul ne bataaya ki pehle panchkula se sibiai kii court ambala main thi
 When these people used to go there for hearing, the crowd of Baba's supporters used to create terror there
 haalat yah ho gai ki jis din sunwaayee hoti thi or baba kii peshi hoti thi us din ambala police line ke bheetar espi ke aphis main asthaayee court banaaya jaataa tha
 Outside the camp, supporters gathered
 aisi haalat main un do sadhviyon ne gavaahi di or dati raheen, aasaan baat nahin us baba ke khilaaf jisase milane congress ke bade-bade netaa, bijepi ke amit shah, kailash vijayawargeey, haryana kii cabinet vahaan salaami dene jaati thim
 Whereas these leaders contest elections in the name of protection of women
 kya inhone sadhvi kaa saath diya
 The comments 15 saal kii kahani kaise samet den das minute main
 Is very long
 anshul kii haalat ye he ki ek ganman mila hua tha
 There was so much deployment across the state, but no one thought that the security of Anshul Chhatrapati's house should be increased
 police se mulaakaat bhi kii magar nateeja nahin niklaa
 After the decision, when the media raised the matter, some security personnel are now stationed outside their house
 baad main jab sibiai kii adaalat panchkula main shift hui to sirsa se panchkula 250 kimi kii yatra tay kar anshul chhatrapati ek ganman ke saath jate the or gurmeet singh ram rahim usee sirsa ke court main video conferencing se gavaahi dete the
 This is the condition of the common man
 aaj punjab-haryana hoicourt ke aadesh na hote to aapke paas yakeen karne ke laayak kuch nahin hota ki hinsa par utari is bheed se vaaki sarkaar sakhti se nipat rahi he
 The High Court's comment is no less strict
 is araajaktaa ke liye koun zimmedaar he
 You yourself have let people do all this
 aapane panchkula main bheed kyon jamaa hone di
 Why are these officers mute spectators? aap khud inaki madad kar rahe hai
 His supporters are coming on foot and are unable to catch up
 jat andolan ke samay bhi aisa hua tha
 By the time the order passed, the damage had been done
 kya panchkula bharat kaa hissaa he
 The court even asked this
 adaalat ne centre sarkaar kii bhi khinchaai kar di or kaha ki ham ummid karte hai ki aap aage aakar panchkula ke logon kii madad karenge
 Or say whether Panchkula is a part of India or not
 hoicourt kii tippanee kathor se kathortam hoti ja rahi thi
 The punjab-haryana High Court said that the assets of Dera Sacha Sauda be confiscated
 usase nuksaan kii bharpai kii jaae
 But the chief secretary of the state kept saying that the government would compensate for the loss

 unki is ghoshnaa ke baad bhopal desh kaa pehla aisa shahar hoga jahaan gaayon ke antim sanskaar ke liye vishesh taur par muktidhaam banaaya jayega
 Talk that Bhopal Mayor Alok Sharma is from BJP
 alok sharma ne apane is faisle ko lekar kaha ki gaay doodh detii he to uski puja hoti he jab band kar detii he to aawaara kehane lagate hai
 In such a situation, the Municipal Corporation had made a provision that Gow Mukti Dham will be built as soon as the place of Gau Muktidham is made in the budget

 Significantly, the Congress in its manifesto promised to open a cowshed in every panchayat in the state

 Congress spokesperson Manak Aggarwal said that the cow is talking about making Mukti Dham, but first the cows which are on the road should reach the cowshed

 In the initial phase of this plan, it was said to run ambulance service in three districts

 Narendra Modi ji changed the contract to Rs 30,000 crore

 The terrorist attack on Thursday in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir has left the country shaken
 is vakt shahar-shahar gam or gusse kaa maahaul he or log chaahate hai ki sarkaar is kyrana hamale ke liye jimmedaar logon ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kare
 Also, tough steps should be taken against the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed and their refuge Pakistan
 hamale ke baad desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dalon ne isaki ninda kii or sarkaar ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar aatank ke khilaaf ladaai main saath khadey hone kii baat kahi
 The ruling party BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are constantly assuring the public that whatever forces are behind the attack will be avenged
 lekin is baar sargical strike kii tarah na to kisi vipaksh dal ne sarkaar se sawaal kiye or na hi suraksha main chook kaa mudda uthaakar sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish kii
 After the Pulwama attack, other parties including the main opposition Congress were also seen standing with the government
 yahaan tak ki congress ne to hamale ke baad apane do bade raajnneetik kaaryakramon ko bhi taal diya
 But the reason for this silence of the opposition is also because he does not want to give any issue to the BJP in this critical time and also show solidarity for the country before the elections
 sargical strike se sabakcongress or aam aadmi party samet kai vipakshi dalon ne sargical strike ke baad sarkaar ke is kadam par sawaal uthaae the, jiskaa khamiyaja in dalon ko bhugatna padaa
 BJP leaders whipped the leaders who questioned the surgical strike at their election rallies
 saath hi ise sena ke shaury or parakram kaa apmaan bhi bataaya
 After this, those who questioned this move of the government came under the scanner 
 ab koi vipakshi dal chunaav se pehle aisi galati nahin doharaata chaahate taaki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle unki chhavi desh virdohi dal kii ban jaae, kyonki bijepi agar aisa prachaarit karti he to iskaa asar loksabhaa chunaav main pad saktaa he
 The martyrdom of the soldiers martyred in Jammu and Kashmir
 There are incidents of encounter and ceasefire violations in which our soldiers have been martyred
 lekin is baar aatankiyon ne ek bade hamale ko anjaam diya he jisamen CRPF ke 40 jawan ek saath shahid hue hai
 The country is in shock due to this dastardly act of terrorists
 aise main vipakshi dal janabhaawanaaon kaa sammaan karte hue is vakt sarkaar par kisi tarah ke siyaasi hamale se batch rahe hai
 Generally, the opposition parties who have taken the government to task for the martyrdom of the soldiers are aware of the atmosphere of outrage created after this big terrorist attack
 abhi agar koi bhi dal is par siyaasi bayaanbaji karata he to use javaanon kii shahadat kaa gussa bhi jhelana padegaa
 Do not give to BJP the political arms Prime Minister Narendra Modi is constantly making statements in the public meetings to avenge the attack
 iske alaava bijepi adhyaksh amit shah purv kii upie ko majaboor sarkaar bataakar congress par nishaanaa sadhate aae hai
 If any opposition party tries to surround the government at this time, then the stakes may be reversed as the BJP will make it an issue and the same statement will serve to set the agenda of election rallies
 vipakshi netaaon ke bayanon ko pehle bhi pradhanmantri se lekar bijepi ke tamaam bade netaa chunavi mudda bana chuke hai
 In such a situation, no party would want the BJP to be given any political weapon after the Pulwama attack
 aatank ke khilaaf ekajuamodi sarkaar ne sargical strike ke jariye apane kaarykaal kii sabase badi sainya karrwai karke dikhaai he
 The Central Government has been adopting a policy of zero tolerance against terror from the beginning
 aise main vipakshi netaa is chuppi ke jariye sandesh dena chaahate hai ki is badi ladaai main vah sarkaar ke saath khadey hai
 Also, the world needs to show such solidarity at the global level as well
 padosi mulk pakistan ke saath sambandh ho yaa phir kootnithik taur par pakistan ko alag-thalag karne ke prayaas, in sabhi main vipakshi dal sarkaar ke saath khadey dikhnaa chaahate hai
 Challenge hidden in silence In this silence of opposition parties, a challenge for the Modi government is also hidden
 vipaksh ke tamaam netaa abhi sarkaar par sawaal bhale hi na khadey karen lekin baar-baar antakawaad par ection kii maang jarur doharaa rahe hai
 On TV, Congress leaders are repeatedly reminding the BJP of the statement '10 heads instead of one'
 iske alaava pakistan se sabhi tarah ke rishte khatm karne kaa dawaab bhi sarkaar par banaaya ja rahaa he
 The result of this pressure was that the central government withdrew MFN status from Pakistan on the very next day of the attack
 ab vipakshi dalon kii ore se sarkaar ko sidhaa chalange he ki ham aapke saath khadey hai lekin aap aatankwaad ke khilaaf karrwai karke dikhaaen
 In today's environment, this silence has many political meanings
 lekin jaise-jaise chunaav najadik aayega vipakshi dalon kii yah chuppi tikhe hamalon kaa rup dhaaran kar legi, kyonki tab maahaul alag hoga
 Today the leaders who remain silent will be ready to seek answers from the government from the electoral forums at that time, in that time the government will also have to answer the opposition's question and also win the public's trust through land tax action

 Vat Savitri Vrat is very special for women who believe in Hinduism
 manyata he ki is vrath ko rakhane se pati par aae sankat chale jate hai or aayu lambii ho jaati he
 Not only this, if there is any problem in the married life, then they also get away from the glory of this fast
 suhaagin mahilaayein apane pati kii lambii umr or sukhad vaivaahik jivan kii kaamana karte hue is din vat yani ki bargad ke ped ke neeche puja-archana karti hai
 On this day, there is a law to hear the story of Savitri and Satyavan
 manyata he ki is katha ko sunne se manavaanchit fal kii prapti hoti he
 According to the legend, Savitri brought back the life of her husband Satyavan from Yama, the god of death
 savitri sabhi gunon se sampann kanya thi, jiske liye yogya var na milane ke kaaran savitri ke pita duhkhi rahane lage
 Once, he sent the daughter to find herself a groom
 is khoj main savitri ek van main ja pahunchi jahaan uski bhent salve desh ke raja dyumtsen se hoti he
 Dumatsen lived in the same Tapovan as his kingdom was taken away by someone
 savitri ne unke putr satyawan ko dekhakar unhen pati ke rup main varan kiya
 Here, when Rishi Raj Narad came to know about this, he went to Ashwapati and said - Your girl has made a huge mistake in finding a groom
 satyawan gunwan tathaa dharmatma he parantu vah alpaayu he or ek varsh ke baad hi uski mrityu ho jaaegi
 King Ashwapati's face became discolored after hearing Narada's words
 "vrutha na hohin dev rishi bani" aansa vichaar karke unhone apni putree ko samajhaayaa ki aise alpaayu vyakti ke saath vivaah karnaa uchit nahin he
 So choose another groom
 is par savitri apane pita se kahati he ki pitaaji- arya kanyaayein apane pati kaa ek baar hi varan karti he, tathaa kanyadan bhi ek hi baar kiya jaataa he
 Whatever happens now, i have accepted Satyavan as a groom
 is baat ko sun donon kaa vidhi-vidhaan ke saath panigrahan sanskaar kiya gaya or savitri apane sasuraal pahunchate hi saas-sasur kii seva main rat ho gai
 Time changed, Narada's words impatient Savitri day by day
 usne jab janaa ki pati kii mrityu kaa din najadik aa gaya he tab teen din purv se hi upwas shuru kar diya
 Narada worshiped the ancestors on the fixed date
 nity kii bhaanti us din bhi satyawan apane samay par lakdi kaatane ke liye chalaa gaya to savitri bhi saas-sasur kii ajna se apane pati ke saath jangal main chalane ke liye taiyaar ho gai
 Satyavan reached the forest and climbed the tree to cut wood
 vriksh par chadhate hi satyawan ke sir main asahneeya pidaa hone lagi
 He was distraught and came down from the tree
 savitri apana bhavishya samaj gai tathaa apni god kaa sirhaana banaakar apane pati ko lita liya
 At the same time, a very impressive Mahisharuddha Yamraj was seen coming from the south
 dharmraj satyawan ke jivan ko jab lekar chal die to savitri bhi unke peeche-peeche chal padi
 At first, Yamraj explained to her the devi-vidhan, but seeing her loyalty and paternity, she asked her to ask for a bride
 savitri boli- "mere saas-sasur vanavaasi tathaa andhe he
 Give them divine light
 " yamraj ne kaha, "aisa hi hoga or ab tum laut jaao
 "hearing Yamraj, he said," Lord, i have no problem in following my husband
 pati ke peeche chalanaa meraa kartavya he
 "hearing this, he again asked her to ask for another groom
 savitri boli, "hamaare sasur kaa rajya chhin gaya he, use ve pun: praapt kar saken, saath hi dharmaparayan bane rahen
 "yamraj gave this groom and said," Well now you go back but she did not listen
 "yamraj ne kaha ki pati ke praanon ke alaava jo bhi maangana he maang lo or laut jaao
 This time Savitri asked for a boon to become the mother of Satyavan's hundred sons
 yamraj ne tathastu kaha or aage chal die
 Savitri still followed him
 uske is krit se yamraj naaraaz ho jate hai
 Seeing the anger of Yamraj, Savitri bowed to him and said, "you have blessed me to be the mother of hundred sons, but how can i become a mother without a husband, so you can fulfill your third boon
" Complete your word "savitri kii pativrat dharm kii baat jaanakar yamraj ne satyawan ke praan ko apane pash se mukt kar diya
 Savitri took Satyavan's life and reached under the Vat tree and Satyavan got up alive
 donon harsith hokar apni rajdhani kii ore chal padey
 Arriving there, he saw that his parents had received the divine light
 is prakaar savitri-satyawan chirkaal tak rajya sukh bhogate rahe
 It is believed that if there is any crisis on the married life of the worshiper or the life of a life partner, by observing the Vat Savitri fast and listening to its story, then it is averted

 In the case of sex between men and women, it has always been believed that man is a cupid by nature whereas women have to be prepared
 lekin is saal ke hamaare survey main bistar par ab stri-purush sambandhon main paaramparik bhed nahin rah gaye haih agar 64 pratishat purush apane anicchhuk saathi ko sex karne ke liye baadhya karte hai to 60 pratishat striyaan bhi aisa hi karti hai
 The second criterion is to enjoy pleasure and pleasure: if 91 percent of men consider sex to be very enjoyable, then 90 percent of women believe the same
 hamaare 2003 ke survey main sex main santushti kaa anubhav karne vaali striyon kii sankhya mahaj 54 fisadi thi
 a decade ago, survey figures had heard the movement of a newly released woman, but she was hesitant to express her wishes openly
 uskaa jivan vivaah kii asmaan yathasthitiyon main kaid tha, vah aparaadh bodh or naitik duvidhaon se grast thi
 From that tension, a new, self-destructive woman is born, who wears the clothes of her choice, marries whenever she wants, and decides to become a mother of her own free will
 2003 kii dabi-sahami gruhinee ke vipareet, aaj vah padhai-likhaai, workaplace or sabase badhkar apni sex life main aage nikal janaa chaahati he
 Her desires in every case, from sex relations to contraception, even masturbation - are motivating her to explore a new destination
 ab badlaav hi ekmaatr sthaayee bhav haih agar 2003 main mahaj 8 fisadi auraten kah rahi thim ki unka bedroom har roj nai uttejnaa se bharaa hota he to ab aisa daawa karne vaali 18 fisadi hai
 If 64 per cent of women in 2003 had called pre-marital sex as zero, then their number has reduced to just 50 per cent
 2003 main 9 fisadi ne porn film dekhne kii aadat ko kabool kiya tha to unki sankhya ab 35 fisadi he
 There is a change in what attracts women the most among men
 2003 main 28 fisadi striyon ne us ekmaatr kamottejak or swaabhaavik ang ko hi uttejk mana tha jabaki ab unki apane saathi ke anya angon main bhi dilchaspee jag gai he, 25 fisadi ne mardon kii jaanghon ko ‘‘sabase aakarshak’’ mana
 There is no doubt that for the first time in a ten-year survey, women and men are seen standing on the same rank
 yah manyata puri tarah tut chuki he ki striyaan bhaawanaaon main bahakar paas aati hai or purush shaareerik banaavat se aakarshith hota he
 On the contrary, the survey shows that both men and women are more or less driven by the same kind of lust towards each other
 jab yah poocha gaya ki shkya sex aapke liye ahm he?’’, 91 fisadi purushon ne ‘‘haa’’ kaha, or yahi jawaab dene vaali striyaan 86 fisadi thim-yani 2003 ke mukaable 20 fisadi adhik
 Do regulars have sex at least once every week? In response to this, the number of women was more i
e
 46 percent while 42 percent of the men said yes
 phir apane sex jivan main uttejnaa paidaa karne ke liye unhen kaam sutara kii bhi jarurat nahih stri or purush donon alag-alag pojishan kaa anand uthaate hai or santushti praapt karte hai
 What are the factors that led to this silent revolution happening in the bedroom? The truth is that a better environment for women to have a satisfying relationship with a secure economic future was never like today
 ladkiyaan skool parikshaon main ladakon se aage nikal rahi hai
 Now more and more women are getting admission in higher education competitions
 21veen sadi ke prarambh ke mukaable ucch shiksha main 70 fisadi adhik mahilaayein pravesh paa rahi hai
 According to the UGC report, the number of students seeking admission in engineering has doubled compared to 2000-01
 management or commers main 68 fisadi, vigyaan main 72 fisadi or medicine main 89 fisadi chatraayen pravesh paa rahi hai
 The difference between skilled men and women in the country is ending — 14 percent of skilled women are now, compared to 16 percent of men in urban areas — so new employment opportunities are opening up: from the service sector to banks
 2013 ke axenture survey ke mutabik mahilaayein workaplace main apni haisiyat main purush sahyogiyon ke mukaable zyada khush hai
 They also realize that work is no less important than home
 shiksha or rojgaar ke nae avasar khulne se striyon ke nijee jivan main nai tarah kii chusti aa gai he
 The workplace is the new playground
 sahyogiyon se afaire or romance ke maamle 2003 main mahaj 3 fisadi mahilaon tak simit the
 In 2013, 16 per cent of women are willing to have a good, short-term relationship with their partners
 or isamen sirf ladkiyaan hi nahin hai
 In 2003, only 3 per cent confessed to making sex the basis for job growth
 ab apni naukari main ram chukin 17 fisadi striyaan apane bos ko khush karnaa teji se upar jane kaa aasaan rasta maanati hai
 If 16 percent of men make gestures by praising the beauty of their female colleagues, then 16 percent of women are also ready to do so
 to, kya auraton ko yon aazaadee hasil ho chuki he or ve purushon kii tarah hi vyavhaar karne main sakasham ho gai hai? auraten pehle se nishchit rup se adhik aaazaad hui hai
 As before, women have become stronger in exchange for being in khusur-phusur
 survey main 23 fisadi se adhik mahilaon ne apane yon jivan ke bare main baaten nahin kin
 In contrast, 64 percent of men spend their sex life with other men and only 13 percent avoid private matters in public
 apane rishte se khush na rahane par mahilaon se adhik purush (62 fisadi) uski charchaa karte hai, phir bhi purush hi zyada vivahetar sambandh (12 fisadi) banaate hai
 a calm and balanced 20 per cent of the women do nothing when the relationship is sour, but 14 per cent of the women break the relationship if the partner is unfaithful
 2003 main aisa kadaa kadam uthaane kii himmat sirf 6 fisadi mahilaayein hi karti thim
 Are men ready for such situations? hardly
 ve aadhuniktaa ke sang puraani rudhipoon ko thame rakhane ke aadi hai
 Most men like to see their women in traditional costumes, but are aroused by those women
 jo bistar par ‘‘gandi baaten’’ karti hai; adhiktar gadraye badan vaali or unke liye hastmaithun karne vaali auraton kii phantasy bunate hai; zyaadaatar maanate hai ki sex unka vaivaahik adhikaar he phir bhi ve apni sahyogiyon ko tarakkee dilaane ke liye shaareerik sambandh kii baat kabool karte hai
 The 2003 sex survey showed the rise of the modern woman, she was "controlling her desires more than her life"
 2013 main vah apni jaruraton or ichchhaaon kaa khulkar izhaar karne lagi he
 This can make it difficult for men to undergo huge reversals in explicit roles in the bedroom and beyond
 bharat main achche jivan ko paribhaashit karne vaala mahakavy kaam sutara bhautik sukhon ke liye dharm, arth, kaam ko jaruri maanata he
 The man may be confused in this because suddenly he is challenged from the other side

 In an affidavit filed by Attorney General GE Vahanvati in the Supreme Court, the government said that there is no need to form a consensus in the three-member High Member Committee on the appointment of CVC

 ’ It seems that BJP leaders have changed the tone after coming to power
 maharashtra ke emelsi ashish selaar ne garibon kaa majaak udaate hue kaha ki 5 rupee main bharpayt bhojan miltaa he
 BJP today joked with the public about inflation
 mumbai main bijepi netaa ashish salaare ne paanch rupee main bharpayt khaane kaa bayaan dekar siyaasi badahazmi paidaa kar di
 One cup of tea - 7 rupees, one roti - 3 rupees, a plate of lentils - 20 rupees
 vada pav plate- 13 rupee, bharpayt khaanaa- 40 rupee tak
 
 
 Forget this cheapest rate card for eating and eating in Modi's expensive era
 bijepi ke hi ek bade netaa ne wo formula talash liya he, jiske tahat sirf paanch rupee main bharpayt or bharpoor bhojan kii guarantee he
 For five rupees which is only cold water or hot tea, the address of the hotel where you can eat it at the same price has been released by the BJP leader Ashish Cellar of Mumbai in the public interest
 selaar ne kaha, 'mumbai main ek ore jahaan mahangi dish khaane main milti he to duusari taraf paanch rupee main petbhar khaanaa bhi miltaa he
 'in Delhi, the Modi government is chanting onion chalisa, while here in Mumbai their own leaders are showing the miracle of eating a full meal for five rupees
 paanch rupaya main bharpayt khaane kaa bayaan dilli tak pahunchaa to siyaasi haajama bigadane laga
 Those statements of the Congress were also being removed from the political museum, who were giving the address of eating in full for five rupees
 congress ke raaj babbar ne mahangaai par majaak main saat rupye kii baaji maar lee thi
 Took a lot of food for 12 rupees and enjoyed it in a full meal
 paanch rupye main bharpayt khaane kaa funda bijepi se pehle congress ke ek dhakad netaa bhi talash chuke hai
 The issue is from Delhi rather than Mumbai, where Rashid Masood gave the Delhi-based recipe of a plate full of five rupees during the expensive days of the Manmohan government
 jis desh main aalu pyaaj daal chaaval tak kaa bhav aasmaan chhu rahaa he, jo sarkaar mahangaai ke saamne ghutane tech rahi he, jahaan har roj mahangaai kii nai kisht janata ke sir par lad di jaati ho vahaan paanch rupee main bharpayt khaane kaa bayaan kis soch or sarokaar kaa paimaana tay karata he

 chif workshop manager (NCR) jhaansi (upi) 284003 On Sunday afternoon, news came that three Aam Aadmi Party mlas from Delhi have gone to Goa, while the party is unaware of this
 isse party main hadakamp much gaya or media ke reporters turant sakriy ho gaye
 The reason for media reporters being active was that according to party sources, they were not aware of the visit
 iske saath hi ve yah ishaara bhi kar rahe the ki goa ek bijepi shasit pradesh he
 Shraddh is just about to end and in Navratri, it is possible that BJP is forming the government in Delhi and in such a situation you are breaking the MLA

 On Monday morning, AAP MLA Dharmendra Koli from Seemapuri said that they have been visiting this way before
 unpar bijepi ke sampark main hone ke jo aarope lag rahe hai ve bilkul galat hai
 At the same time, AAP MLA Prakash Jarwal from Deoli said that he had already informed the party
 yahi nahin unka kahana tha ki jab congress yaa bijepi ke netaa kahin ghoomane jate hai, to koi baat nahin hoti lekin jab aap vidhayak jate hai to khabaren ban jaati hai
 Party leader Manish Sisodia said that this is like an conspiracy in which you are trying to make the mlas weak, is it wrong to go somewhere? aadhikarik bayanon se to aisa lagata he ki jaise kuch hua hi nahin or sabakuch media kii atakalon kaa nateeja he
 But the fact is that the smoke arises only when there is a fire, that is, there is a communication gap between the party and its mlas
 saath hi yah bhi saafe hua ki party ko vidhayakon par vishwaas utana nahin, jitna daawa kiya jaataa he

 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has given a befitting reply to those who questioned the Indian Air Force air strike and asked the number of terrorists killed
 rajasthan main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue rajnath ne kaha ki jo yudhvir hota he, vah maare gaye logon kii ginati nahin karata he
 Earlier, Rajnath Singh said that the target of the Indian Air Force can never be missed

 Earlier, surveillance by the National Technical Research Organization (NTRO) revealed that when the Mirage fighter jets of the Indian Air Force attacked the terrorist camps of jaish-e-mohammed in Balakot, Pakistan, there were more than 280 mobile phones active there
 
 bhartiya khufia agenciyon ne bhi satellite ke jariye jaish-e-mohammad ke balakot campon main aatankiyon ke maujuud hone kii jaankaree uplabdh karai thi
 Along with this, the RAW also said in its intelligence report that a large number of terrorists were present in the camps of jaish-e-mohammad in Balakot

 At the same time, Pakistan was not aware of the action of the Indian Air Force
 jab pakistan ko bharat kii is karrwai kii jaankaree hui, to vah baukhala gaya
 He then tried to attack Indian military bases, but the Indian Air Force foiled his intentions
 is dauraan bhartiya vayusena ke wing commander abhinandan ne pakistan ke F-16 ladaaku vimaan ko maar giraaya tha
 Abhinandan reached Pakistan's airspace, chasing down Pakistani fighter jets during an air crash
 is bich pakistan ne unke vimaan par missile yaa air artilari se hamalaa kar diya, jisamen abhinandan kaa mig-21 ladaaku vimaan pakistan ke kabje vaale ilaake main gir gaya tha
 At the same time, Abhinandan, a wing commander flying the mig-21, reached Pakistan-occupied territory, where he was captured by the Pakistani Army

 ) Bharatiya Janata Party leader Naresh Aggarwal has said that the alliance of Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party will break the very next day after the election results are declared
 naresh agarwal ne kaha ki bahujan samaaj party kii adhyaksh mayawati khud akhilesh yadav kaa saath chhod dengi or vah chauraahey par daudte najar aaenge
 Naresh Agarwal, once the face of Samajwadi Party, said this during the Lok Sabha election campaign in Hardoi, UP and during this time he did not spare even his former leader Akhilesh Yadav
 naresh agarwal ne kaha ki 23 may ko jab chunaav nattejey ghoshit honge to agle hi din mayawati unka saath chhod dengi or sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav sadakon par daudte hue najar aaenge
 Naresh Aggarwal also gave an argument behind his claim
 naresh ne kaha, ''23 may ko matganana hogi or 24 ko mayawati kahengi ki main gathbandhan todatii hum, musalmaan or ahir ne hamako dhokhaa diya he
 After this, Akhilesh will roam like a monkey at the crossroads, and will be seen running at the crossroads ''

 Naresh Aggarwal has not only accused Mayawati of breaking the alliance, but has also used controversial words for Akhilesh Yadav

 Recently a completely new face of terrorism has emerged
 ab tak aapane aatankwaadiyon ke alag-alag chehre dekhe honge
 But now for the first time a consignment of terrorists has been sent from across the border, which looks like a girl
 ye snipers yani shooter hai
 Long Hair
 kajaraari ankhen
 Delicate fingers
 sar par dupatta
 slender figure
 magar ye kya
 Why are the guns kept on the head
 koun he ye? kahin koi khubasurat bhalaa to nahin? shaayad haa
 
 bhalaa hi he ye
 That is why the Indian Army has been looking for this for a long time
 kyonki qaatil he ye
 5 security personnel including 2 army personnel
 to kya sach main ab in najuk kandhon par he kashmir main dehshat failaane kii zimmedaari
 Do the masters sitting on the other side of the border no longer believe their terrorists
 or wo in hasinaaon ko mishan kashmir par bhej rahe hai
 At first when the Indian Army got these pictures, they probably felt the same
 kyonki ye or inke jaise kareeb 3 or ko sarhad isliye paar karai gai he taaki ye nishaanaa bana saken
 By masking the security forces and that too by hiding their identity so that the identity remains
 magar yakeen jaaniye jab in chehron se nakaab utraa to yakeen nahin hua
 As these masks descended from these faces
 sabake chehre kaa mizaaj bhi badal gaya
 Yes
 
 Yes, everyone was shocked when the truth came out
 kyonki agar is chehre se nakaab naa utarataa to aap bhi vahi soch rahe hote jaisaa ham soch rahe the
 This was also an attempt by the masters of terror
 kyonki ye snipers hai
 They hide their targets in easy tongues
 kashmir main aise hi chaar logon ne suraksha balon kii naak main dam kar rakhaa he
 Now since they are masked on the face, it is also difficult to know if there is a man or a woman behind the mask
 aise hi baharupia banakar ye kashmir main army ke javaanon ko nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 So far 5 security personnel have been targeted by such snipers
 aatanki sanghathan jaish ne hamale ke liye apnesnipersako seemaa paar karai he
 Two groups of two snipers have been formed
 jinhen baqayada khufia hamale kii training dekar bheja gaya he
 He has been given this training by Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI himself
 sutron ke mutabik spipers ko lekar ek khufia report grih mantralay ko bheji gai he
 According to him, these snipers of Jaish have entered India in two groups in the month of September
 jo atyaadhunik hathiyaaron se lash hai
 And the sniper that you are looking at, looking like a beautiful girl, is Abu Qari
 abu kaari kaa cheharaa ab benakaab ho chukaa he
 And until now the sniper was stealthily attacking the army
 ab wo khud sena ke nishane par aa gaya he
 For the past several days, this sniper named Abu Qari was targeting security forces personnel along with his terrorist gang
 5 surakshakarmiyon kii hatya ke peeche abu kaari or us jaise snipers kaa hi haath bataaya ja rahaa he
 The first suspected case of a sniper attack came out on 18 September 2018
 pulavama ke neva main ek siarpief jawan ghayal hua
 He was attacked from a distance

 sub-inspector Rajendra Prasad of the CISF was killed in one such suspected sniper attack on Naugam on the outskirts of Srinagar
 in sandigdh sniper hamalon ke baad kashmir main surakshabalon ke kaan khadey ho gaye hai
 The eyes of the security forces' attentive soldiers are now looking for those 4 suspected snipers
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki inamen se abu kaari dakshini kashmir main gum rahaa he
 The army is still gathering more evidence regarding sniper attacks by terrorists in Kashmir
 haalanki khufia agenciyaan aise hamalon ke liye aagaah kar chuki hai
 Suspected sniper attackers operating in the Kashmir Valley are feared to have such m-four carbines
 jaise carbine nato sainikon ne afghanistan main istemaal kiye the
 Such weapons can be attacked from 500 to 600 meters away
 saath hi hamalaavaron ke paas nite vijan divaais hone kii ashanka jataayi ja rahi he kyonki sandigdh sniper hamale raat main hi hue hai
 While the conspiracy and preparation of terrorists are being seen during suspected sniper attacks, the lapses from Indian security personnel have also come to light
 kyonki hamalon ke vakt bhartiya surakshakarmi apni post par baahar the or mobile phone kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 The presence of suspected sniper attackers in the Kashmir Valley has posed a challenge to the security forces, and concerns have also been raised about VIP security in the state
 kashmir police ke aiji ne sabhi suraksha agenciyon ko chitthee likhakar aise snipers ke bare main aagaah kar diya he or surakshakarmiyon ko guideline bhi jari kii gai he
