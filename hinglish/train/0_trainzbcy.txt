 To investigate the role of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the Delhi PWD scam, Delhi LG Anil Baijal ordered the investigation department to the Vigilance Department to attack the Aam Aadmi Party LG itself
 'aap' netaa ashutosh ne alji par aarope lagaaya he ki wo bijepi kaa agent banakar dilli sarkaar ke khilaaf saazish rach rahe hai
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson and a close leader of Kejriwal, Ashutosh has accused LG of planting fake complaints
 ashutosh ne kaha ki peedblyudi ghotaale se mukhyamantri kaa koi lenaa dena nahin he
 It is unfortunate that the person sitting there is expected to fulfill his impartial duty as the LG post is a constitutional post
 alji anil baijal purv alji najeeb jang kii tarah bijepi ke agent ban gaye hai
 We felt that the situation would change after the common LG, but the LG themselves complain, order the investigation themselves
 'aap' pravaktaa ashutosh se jab ye sawaal poocha gaya ki peedblyoody ghotaale main jaanch se sarkaar kyon dar rahi he to iske jawaab main unhone kaha ki "peedblyoody ghotalemen bansal parivaar kii jaanch se kisi ne nahin roka, jo jimmedaar he use sajaa milani chahie lekin usamen dilli ke mukhyamantri kii bhoomika kii talash karnaa galat he
 There are also BJP people complaining to LG
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki jahaan jaanch ke aadesh karnaa chahie vahaan jaanch nahin karai gai
 i will disclose it when the time comes
 bijepi ke log aam aadmi party sarkaar ko asthir karne kii koshish kar rahi he or alji anil baijal is shadyantr kaa hissaa ban gaye hai
 "ashutosh alleged that LG does not give Aam Aadmi Party leaders time to meet, while meeting opponents immediately
 unhone aage bataaya ki "meri 3 din tak appointment maangane ke baad alji se mulaaqaat hui lekin aaj kapil mishra subah appointment maangate hai or 2 ghante baad unhen appointment mil jaataa he, aisa kyon?unhone kaha ki shatanraj kii tarah khel khelaa ja rahaa he
 First make allegations, then order an inquiry and create an atmosphere among the people that the people of Aam Aadmi Party are wrong
 alji anil baijal se kahuunga ki bijepi ke shadyantr kaa hissaa na bane, varanaa aapaki chhavi dhoomil hogi" haalanki abtak alji par naram rahane vaali aam aadmi party kaa badla hua rukh hairaan karata he
 As soon as the news of investigation against its chief Arvind Kejriwal comes to the fore, the AAP leaders attacking LG, also raise many questions

 It states that the trend of groundwater exploitation is the same in almost all the districts of the state and this has led to a rapid decline in the groundwater table

 jise sankshep main punya pratap bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 Those who could not be made, they must have been searching for the astrology that had been observing a fast for several days or was wearing emerald topaz

 Anchor journalists were watching the minister taking the oath as per the caste and caste equation
 jaise mahendranath pandey shapath lene aae to kaha jane laga ki upi main brahman cheharaa hai
 The discussants forgot that Kalraj Mishra and Mahesh Sharma already exist from this quota
 mahendranath ko kuch logon ne kaha ki koi nahin jaanata, baad main pataa chalaa ki sangh inhen jaanata he

 The number of seats reserved for Scheduled Castes in Uttar Pradesh is 17
 in sabhi par bhartiya janata party ke ummidavaar jite the
 At that time, the BJP did not need a Dalit face

 The BJP has the highest number of 40 Dalit mps in the Lok Sabha
 aaj jin 19 saansadon ko rajyamantri banaaya gaya he unamem se 5 dalit hai

 yah sawaal vidhayak se lekar saansad bane daliton ko khud se poochna chahie, apni party se poochna chahie or apane matadaata ko bhi bataanaa chahie
 The voter should also ask him why you become a minister of state in the name of society and a cabinet minister, then why do you become a minister of social justice and empowerment
 maujuuda raajnneeti or mantrimandal main ramvilas paswan hi iklauta aisa naam he jo dalit hote hue bhi kabhi saamaajik nyaay va adhikarita mantri nahin rahe
 Paswan was a minister in several governments

 Meira Kumar was the speaker, but when she was a minister, she was the Minister of Social Empowerment

 Half of the 24 cabinet ministers of the Modi cabinet, sworn in on 26 May 2014, were 12 upper castes and two Dalit Kabina ministers
 swatantra prabhaar vaale 10 mantriyo main se paanch apper cast ke the
 Not a single Dalit was among the ministers with independent charge
 pehali baar shapath lene vaale kul 46 mantriyon main se 20 aprcast, 13 obisi, 6 anusuchit jati or 3 dalit the
 3 Dalit ministers in the entire cabinet
 is baar jis upi ke liye rajya mantri banaae gaye hai vahaan se inke bagaiyr amit shah ne loksabhaa kii 80 siton main se 71 par apane ummidavaar jita diye the
 Now what has happened is that for that UP, BJP has to be Dalit, Brahmin and backward, very backward
 uttar pradesh main anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit siton kii sankhya 17 he
 Bharatiya Janata Party candidates were won on all of them
 tab to bijepi ko dalit chehre kii zarurat nahin padi thi
 Modi was the face of everyone
 bijepi ke paas loksabhaa main sabase adhik 40 dalit saansad hai
 Today, of the 19 mps who have been made ministers of state, 5 are Dalits
 2 adivasee hai
 There are only two Dalit mps in the 27 Cabinet Ministers of the Modi Cabinet
 ek dalit saansad bijepi ke cote se mantri hai jinka naam thavarchand gahalot hai
 Secondly, the Dalit MP is a minister without Lokjan Shakti party quota named Ram Vilas Paswan
 ramvilas paswan khadyann va upabhokta maamle ke cabinet mantri hai
 Thawarchand Gehlot is the Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment
 juel oram anusuchit janajati ke hai or janajati maamalon ke kabina mantri hai
 Now i have a question, why do Dalit mps always become the Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment
 ve vitt mantri kyon nahin banate, videsh mantri kyon nahin banate hai
 Dalits from MLA to MP should ask this question themselves, ask their party and also tell their voters
 matadaata ko bhi use poochna chahie ki aap samaaj ke naam par rajya mantri hi kyon banate hai or cabinet mantri banate hai to saamaajik nyaay va adhikarita mantri hi kyon banate hai
 In the current politics and cabinet, Ram Vilas Paswan is the only name who despite being a Dalit has never been a Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment
 paswan kai sarkaron main mantri rahe
 That railway minister, labor minister, sanchaar mantri, rasayan va urvarak mantri, ispaat mantri, sansadeey kaarymantri kii zimmedaari sambhaal chuke hai
 Paswan's record is excellent
 paswan se poocha janaa chahie ki kya unhen bhi kabhi saamaajik nyaay va adhikarita mantri banane kaa prastaav diya gaya tha yaa wo is mantralay se kaise batch gaye
 In the previous UPA government, Sushil Kumar Shinde was the Home Minister, twice was the Energy Minister
 mira kumaar spikar thim magar jab ve mantri thim to saamaajik adhikarita mantri hi thim
 His father Jagjivan Ram was Defense Minister and Deputy Prime Minister
 mira kumaar jab spikar baniin to unki jagah mallikarjun khadge saamaajik nyaay va adhikarita mantri bane
 Currently, Mallikarjun Kharge is the leader of the Congress party in the Lok Sabha
 unki kaabiliyat kaa pataa hi nahin chalata, agar unhen loksabhaa main ye jimmedaari na milti
 Somewhere the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment does not have parking for Dalit leaders, where the car of all the talented Dalit leaders remains rusted while standing there
 modi sarkaar ko is maamle main bhi yah dharna todani chahie ki dalit saansad sirf samaaj kalyaan mantralay hi sanbhaalega
 The same situation also exists for the Minister of Minority Affairs
 haal hi main elahabaad main jab bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini hui thi tab purv saansad or bijepi netaa sanjay paswan ne kaha tha ki sanghathan ko daliton ke saath bhojan karne, mulaakaat karne ke pratikon or naaron se aage janaa chahie
 The party should go beyond respecting the contributions of Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram and look at the Dalits
 bijepi ne jin paanch dalit saansadon ko rajya mantri banaaya he kya unhen chhavi or pratikon ke khaanche se alag dekha ja saktaa he
 This question will be seen more closely with the distribution of the ministry
 prastaavna likhe jane tak mantralay kii ghoshnaa nahin hui thi
 However, the government told the media that the selection of these ministers should not be viewed through the prism of caste and religion
 unka chayan angrezi varnmaala ke paanchave varna i ke hisaab se kiya gaya he

 soshal media par akbar ke puraane lekhon ko share kar target kiya ja rahaa he
 Just like on social media, many people target other journalists that you say that you are a spokesperson of such and such party
 akbar se pehle kai dalon ne kai akhabaaron ke maalikon ko rajya sabha bheja he
 Along with the owner, the journalist has also done his job
 ye akbar ke pehle pracheen kaal main bhi hua or akbar ke samay main bhi ho rahaa he or akbar ke baad ke atyaadhunik kaal main bhi hoga
 Still, if someone wants to debate politics and journalism relations, first go and delete all the tweets which he has asked such questions to other journalists
 soshal media par target hone vaale patrkaar akbar sahab ko dhaal kii tarah istemaal kar sakate hai or unase prerana bhi le sakate hai
 MJ Akbar has written many books

 Writ After Riot and Nehru The Making of India
 maine akbar kii koi kitaab nahin padhi he, isliye nahin bataa saktaa ki nehru vaali kitaab main aalochana he yaa samalochna yaa phir vandana
 The comments sarkaar kii taraf se bataaya gaya ki kai rajya mantriyon kaa chayan rajyon main mantri or vidhayak rahane ke anubhav ke aadhaar par bhi kiya gaya he
 Fagan Singh Kulaste and Vijay Goel were Ministers of State in the Vajpayee Government and based on this experience, they were also Ministers of State in the Modi Government
 in donon kaa 12 saal pehle kaa anubhav zarur khaas rahaa hoga ki 12 saal baad bhi ye rajya mantri hi banaae gaye
 The media was told that the basis of becoming a minister is efficiency and not caste and religion
 aajkal is catagori ke liye soshal diaversity kaa istemaal hota he
 Therefore, under the social diversity, it was told how many Dalits and how many Muslims have become ministers
 is ginati ke anusaar- do anusuchit jati or paanch anusuchit janajati
 Two minorities and two women have been made ministers
 das rajyon se 19 mantri banaae gaye hai
 Minimum Government, Maximum Governance
 modi sarkaar ne jab shapath lee thi ki tab khub baaten hui thi ki kai mantralyon ko milakar nayaa mantralay banegaa or sarkaar kaa aakaar chota hoga
 According to the rule, there can only be 82 ministers
 mantriyon kii sankhya 78 ho gai he
 Manmohan Singh's government had 78 ministers while it was a coalition government
 gathbandhan kii sarkaar to ye bhi he magar jo sandesh pehle diya gaya tha uski jagah kuch or diya ja rahaa he
 The Modi cabinet also has 78 ministers
 19 rajya mantriyon ke liye vistaar hua he
 Of these, 6 are ministers of state from Rajya Sabha and 13 from Lok Sabha
 uttar pradesh main anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit siton kii sankhya 17 he
 Bharatiya Janata Party candidates were won on all of them
 tab to bijepi ko dalit chehre kii zarurat nahin padi thi
 Modi was the face of everyone
 bijepi ke paas loksabhaa main sabase adhik 40 dalit saansad hai
 Today, of the 19 mps who have been made ministers of state, 5 are Dalits
 2 adivasee hai
 There are only two Dalit mps in the 27 Cabinet Ministers of the Modi Cabinet
 ek dalit saansad bijepi ke cote se mantri hai jinka naam thavarchand gahalot hai
 Secondly, the Dalit MP is a minister without Lokjan Shakti party quota named Ram Vilas Paswan
 ramvilas paswan khadyann va upabhokta maamle ke cabinet mantri hai
 Thawarchand Gehlot is the Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment
 juel oram anusuchit janajati ke hai or janajati maamalon ke kabina mantri hai
 Now i have a question, why do Dalit mps always become the Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment
 ve vitt mantri kyon nahin banate, videsh mantri kyon nahin banate hai
 Dalits from MLA to MP should ask this question themselves, ask their party and also tell their voters
 matadaata ko bhi use poochna chahie ki aap samaaj ke naam par rajya mantri hi kyon banate hai or cabinet mantri banate hai to saamaajik nyaay va adhikarita mantri hi kyon banate hai

 ab meraa ek sawaal he dalit saansad hameshaa saamaajik nyaay va adhikarita mantri hi kyon banate hai
 Why don't they become finance ministers, why don't they become foreign ministers
 yah sawaal vidhayak se lekar saansad bane daliton ko khud se poochna chahie, apni party se poochna chahie or apane matadaata ko bhi bataanaa chahie
 The voter should also ask him why you become a minister of state in the name of society and a cabinet minister, then why do you become a minister of social justice and empowerment
 maujuuda raajnneeti or mantrimandal main ramvilas paswan hi iklauta aisa naam he jo dalit hote hue bhi kabhi saamaajik nyaay va adhikarita mantri nahin rahe
 Paswan was a minister in several governments
 wo rail mantri, shram mantri, Communications Minister, Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister, Steel Minister, Parliamentary Affairs Minister
 paswan kaa ricard shandaar he
 Paswan should be asked whether he too was ever proposed to be the Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment or how he escaped from this ministry
 pichhali upie sarkaar main susheel kumaar scindia grih mantri the, do baar urja mantri rahe
 Meira Kumar was the speaker, but when she was a minister, she was the Minister of Social Empowerment
 unke pita jagjivan ram raksha mantri or up pradhanmantri the
 When Meira Kumar became the speaker, Mallikarjun Kharge became the Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment in his place
 is vakt mallikarjun khadge loksabhaa main congress party ke netaa hai
 His ability is not known if he does not get this responsibility in the Lok Sabha
 kahin saamaajik nyaay va adhikarita mantralay dalit netaaon ke liye parking to nahin he, jahaan tamaam pratibhashali dalit netaaon kii gaadi vahiin khadey khadey jang khaati rah jaati he
 In this case also the Modi government should break the notion that only the social welfare ministry will handle the Dalit MP
 yahi haal alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantri kaa bhi hota he
 Recently, when bjp's national executive was held in Allahabad, former MP and BJP leader Sanjay Paswan said that the organization should go beyond the symbols and slogans of eating, meeting with Dalits
 party ko ambedkar or kanshiram ke yogadanon ko sammaan dene se aage jaakar daliton ko dekhnaa samajhnaa chahie
 Can the five Dalit mps who have been made ministers of state by the BJP be seen differently from the grooves of image and symbols
 mantralay ke vitaran se is sawaal ko or kareeb se dekha ja sakegaa
 The ministry was not announced until the preamble was written
 haalanki sarkaar ne media se yahi kaha ki in mantriyon ke chayan ko jati or dharm ke chashme se na dekha jaae
 They have been selected according to the fifth letter e of the English alphabet

 Special congratulations to MJ Akbar ji on becoming a minister
 wo patrkaar rahe, congress se saansad bane phir patrkaar rahe phir bijepi ke pravaktaa bane, phir bijepi ke saansad bane or ab mantri bane hai
 Akbar's old articles are being targeted by sharing on social media
 thik usee tarah jaise soshal media par kai log duusare patrakaron ko target karte hai ki aapaki ye baat bataati hai ki aap falaan party ke pravaktaa hai
 Prior to Akbar, several parties have sent owners of several newspapers to the Rajya Sabha
 maalik ke saath saath patrkaar ne bhi apana jugad kiya he
 This also happened in the ancient period before Akbar and is also happening in the time of Akbar and will be in the post-akbar era
 phir bhi koi raajnneeti or patrakarita ke sambandhon par bahes karnaa chahta he to pehle jaakar wo saare twit dilit kare jo usne aise sawaal duusare patrakaron se kiye hai
 Journalists who are targeted on social media can use Akbar saheb as a shield and can also take inspiration from them
 em je akbar ne kai kitaaben likhi hai
 Many choices are also made
 rit after rit or nehru da mekking aaf india
 i have not read any of Akbar's books, so i cannot tell whether there is criticism or criticism or vandana in Nehru's book
 tippaniyan It was informed by the government that several state ministers have also been selected on the basis of experience of being ministers and mlas in the states
 fagan singh kulaste or vijay goyal vaajapeyi sarkaar main rajya mantri rahe or is anubhav ke aadhaar par modi sarkaar main bhi rajya mantri rahe
 The experience of these two 12 years ago must have been special that even after 12 years, they were made ministers of state
 media ko baqayda bataaya gaya ki mantri banane kaa aadhaar kaaryakshmata he na ki jati or dharm
 Nowadays social diversity is used for this category
 isliye soshal diaversity ke tahat bataaya gaya ki kitne dalit or kitne musalmaan mantri bane hai
 According to this count - two Scheduled Castes and five Scheduled Tribes
 do alpsankhyak or do mahila ko mantri banaaya gaya he
 19 ministers have been formed from ten states
 minimum gavarment, maxim gavarnence
 There was a lot of talk when the Modi government took the oath that a new ministry would be formed by merging several ministries and the size of the government would be small
 niyam ke anusaar 82 mantri hi ho sakate hai
 The number of ministers has increased to 78
 manmohan singh kii sarkaar main 78 mantri the jabaki wo gathbandhan kii sarkaar thi
 This is also a coalition government, but something else is being given instead of the message that was given earlier
 modi mantrimandal main bhi 78 mantri ho gaye hai
 There has been an expansion for 19 Ministers of State
 inamen se 6 rajya mantri rajya sabha ke hai or 13 lok sabha ke

 So when General Bipin Rawat called the army commanders for an informal meeting in September 2018, a month before that, everyone had guessed that something was cooking
 unka anumaan sahi tha
 In this mobilization in New Delhi, General Rawat presented a plan for reform and reorganization of the army that had not been attempted in several decades
 pichhali farvari main pesh raksha bajet main sena ke paas nae upkarnon ko kharidne ke liye ab tak kaa apana sabase kam bajet uplabdh tha—raksha bajet kaa maatr 13 fisadi yaa 26,826 karod ru
 This was because about 87 percent of the Army's budget is spent on salaries, fuel and ammunition purchases
 jab sena ke commander aupchaarik rup se aktubar main phir se mili, ve general ravat ke shinaakht kiye kshetron kaa vistrut jayja lene ke liye chaar study group ko hari jhandi dikhaa chuke the
 These four studies, led by four lieutenant generals, are a fourfold extended mission
 ye adhyayan field main tainaat sena ko chust, paaramparik or hybrid yuddh ke liye puri tarah se chaak-chauband banane, nai dilli sthit sena mukhyalay ke punargathan, apane adhikariyon ke cader main yuvaaon kii jhalak or sainikon kii bhartee kii sharton ko sanshodhit karne se jude hai, kyonki adhikansh 35 varsh kii aayu main hi sevanivrutt ho jate hai
 The Indian Army, with a strength of 1
2 million, is the world's second largest army after the People's Liberation Army (PLA), which has 21 lakh personnel
 aisi sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he ki is punargathan se 1,00,000 sainikon kii katautee hogi or isse sena ke rajasav bajet (sainikon par hone vaala kharch) par boj kam hoga
 Revenue expenditure is estimated to exceed 90 percent in the coming years
 general ravat kii is vyapak sudhaar yojana kaa lakshya he sena ko feet bananaa or maujuuda bajet se hi sansadhano kaa prabandh karnaa
 In the plan, a new concept of a bulk-up brigade, replacing the Army division, is called the Integrated Battle Group or IBG
 general ravat apni is yojana ke teen mukhya uddeshy bataate hai, ‘‘hamaari maujuuda kshamtaaon ko majboot karke bhavi yuddh ke liye taiyaar rahanaa, apane bajet ko behatar bananaa or dakshata badhanaa
 ʼʼ (see conversation) Army officials are describing this as the army's most comprehensive attempt to reorganize cadres in three decades and it will depend on how effectively this most far-reaching change of army has been implemented since independence

 These recent efforts of General Rawat take that initiative forward, following the Shekatkar Committee's report which was presented in December 2016
 in sudhaaron ke tahat afasaron, junior kamishand afasaron (jesio) or javaanon sahit 57,000 sanyakarmiyon kii punah tainaati or punargathan kaa kaam hoga
 Reform has begun

 This will be followed by about 50 station workshops, in which the army personnel are also partially employed by the common people and the Army Engineer (EME) corps will be trimmed
 inamen se zyaadaatar ko sarkaar ke swaamitv vaale vyavsaayik rup se sanchalit model (jiosioemo) udyogon ko outsource kar diya jayega
 The postal system of the Second World War era and the military farms operating in peacetime will be closed
 haalanki purv raksha mantri manohar parrikar ke dimag kii upaj, shekatkar samiti ne jin sudhaaron kaa prastaav diya tha, usamen sena kii madadgaar aapurti vahini or ejeeniyar kor kaa aakaar ghataane kii baat hi kii gai thi
 The committee did not recommend any change in the composition of the army deployed in the field
 lekin general ravat ke punargathan prayaason main vahi kshetra shaamil hai jin par cameti ne kisi badlaav kii sifarish nahin kii he
 Vishal IBG Forsenral Rawat is known for his blunt style
 yuddh morche par tainaat javaanon ke netritv ke liye mahila adhikariyon ko anupyukt bataae jane sambandhi unki tippaniyon par soshal media par bahut tikhi pratikriya dekhi gai
 Of course, his cleanliness is often passed on to people, but his determination to leave behind a strong military legacy is also evident in him
 sainya diggajon kii haalia baithak main ravat ne kaha ki ve aisa sanghathan chhodkar janaa chaahate hai jo chust, tandoorust or sainya uddeshyon ko puraa karne main sakasham ho
 Rawat has a clear impression in the Army's War War theology released in December
 usamen sainya abhiyaanon main paramparaagat yudgh style kii kendriya bhoomika par jor he
 Also that the army will continue the campaign against terrorism, anti-separatism and proxy wars
 unke punargathan se ummid he ki sena bajtiy or parmaanu, donon tarah kii chunautiyon ke mukaable ke liye puri tarah taiyaar ho jaaegi
 Both potential enemies — China and Pakistan — are armed with nuclear weapons
 ravat samajhate hai ki donon dushmano ke kisi sambhavit saajha morche kii chunautiyon se nipatane se judi taiyaariyon ke liye jitne bade raksha bajet kii jarurat he, vah sena ko shaayad hi mili
 So they have found another way out of it and they are doing Qatar in regional structures meant for traditional warfare
 sena main sanrachanaatmak sudhaar ke jo bhi prayaas hue hai, vishesh rup se yuddh ke liye field kii tainaati, ve aam taur par yathasthiti ko badalane ke liye prayasarat khaas shakhsiyaton se hi jude rahe hai

 Since then, they have consistently encouraged their field commanders to be fully prepared for battle

 But, says a general, many strategic efforts related to cold start had begun even before Rawat's arrival
 ek general kehete hai, ‘‘ve unheen ko lagu karne ke gambhir prayaas kar rahe hai
 में One of the proposed plans is to reduce the current number of army currently standing in front of China from four divisions to just two
 agar general sundarji ne sena ko rapid diya, to general ravat ibiji ko aage badhaane ke liye puraa jor laga rahe hai
 Equipped with infantry, tanks, artillery and mechanized infantry, the command of the IBG will be handed over to a Major General and will operate directly under the Army's 14 Corps-size structure
 yah avadharana america sena ke manuvar unit, paidal sena brigade ladaaku samooh or china kii piele ke sanyukt hathiyaar brigade ke samaan he, jise china 2013 se shuru apane sainya punargathan abhiyaan ke tahat taiyaar kar rahaa he
 The IBG will replace the basic infantry division, the all-arms fighting unit

 There is an opinion in the military that all 45 infantry divisions should be converted to around 140 ibgs
 haalanki, yah is saal chandimandir sthit pashchimi kaman ke do kor main hone vaale ek pareekshan ke parinaamon par nirbhar karegaa

 ve kor mukhyalay ke adheen sidhe sanchalit honge, is prakaar unhen divijan mukhyalayon se alag kar diya jayega
 In this way, about 95 additional Major Generals would be required to command about 140 ibgs, thereby increasing the chances of promotion to lower rank officers
 vartmaan main, ek karnal ko brigadier banane ke liye lagbhag 6-8 varshon tak intjaar karnaa padataa he
 The Army has proposed to reduce the importance of Brigadier rank to a "non-selective grade" appointment as it is an Air Commodore of the Indian Air Force and an equivalent rank of Commodore in the Navy
 is prakaar sabhi karnal swataru brigadier ban jaaenge, jisase unhen ucch vetan praapt hoga or unke major general banane kii sambhaavna bad jaaegi
 The number of brigadiers will be reduced from 1,165 to 936 while the number of Major Generals will be increased from 301 to 396
 yani kul milakar sena main 134 adhikari kam ho jaaenge
 The army has proposed to remove all its division headquarters as the corps will now directly control the IBG

 Hybrid warfare is a military strategy that combines a combination of conventional warfare as well as irregular warfare, legal, cyber warfare and diplomacy to become a highly lethal warfare
 yah prastaavit vishesh bal, sena ko rakshaatmak hybrid yuddh kii chunautiyon se ladgaye main sakasham banayega

 There will also be a need for new directorates and staff to deal with new threats born in the era of information revolution

 At a time when the government's full focus is on reducing the fiscal deficit by bridging the revenue and income gap, the budget for the military is unlikely to increase
 is saal ke bajet main bhi sena ko puunjigat vyay ke mad main 17,756 karod ru
 And 24,755 crore rupees was received less than the revenue he had demanded
 thal sena ko raksha bajet kaa 55 pratishat miltaa he, lekin yah teenon sevaaon ke rajasav bajet kaa 69 pratishat hissaa nigal jaati he
 The army, while seeking to increase the budget, argued that 1 of GDP in the defense budget
 58 pratishat diya gaya jo pichley 50 varshon main sabase kam he
 The thinking of the government can be understood by the statement of Minister of State for Defense Subhash Bhamre in the Rajya Sabha on July 23, 2018
 bhamare ne kaha, ‘‘jidipi bahut teji se bad rahi he isliye jidipi ke pratishat ke rup main raksha bajet to kam kiya ja saktaa he par raksha bajet ke liye aavantit dhan kii maatra main kami nahin hogi
 In support of his argument, Bhamre mentioned the total defense budget of this year which 4
 04 lakh karod ru
 (not 2
 9 lakh karod ru
 Which the government spends only on the armed forces) was
 isamen sainya pension bhi shaamil he, jise 1980 ke dashak main sashastr balon ke bajet se hataakar raksha mantralay ke bajet ke tahat rakhaa gaya tha
 If seen in its entirety, the defense budget is actually 31 percent larger due to this hidden pension component
 bhamare ne kaha, 2018-19 main raksha bajet centre sarkaar ke kul kharch kaa 16

 The Navy and the Air Force have received smaller outlays than the Army

 There is despair all around

 This has hit the capital budget of the three military services by 20 percent

 General Rawat is confident that the government will approve his reorganization
 isamen koi samasya nahin honi chahie kyonki 1962 ke yuddh main haar ke baad se, jab nehru sarkaar par aarope laga tha ki unhone sena par ek alokapriy general ko thope diya tha, lagaataar sarkarein sena kii vyavastha se jude faisle us par hi chhod detii hai
 But will the finance ministry, which allocates the budget, transfer the revenue savings to the capital account? In the past, there has been no occasion on which it can be trusted
 phir bhi, ravat kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar unki baat ko samajhegi
 He says, "I am confident that the government will support us
" jab ham sarkaar ko bataaenge ki hamane aadha rasta tay kar liya he, ab kya aap bhi aadha rasta tay karne ko taiyaar hai? mujhe yakeen he ki ve samaj jaaenge
 हाल However, it remains to be seen how the Finance Ministry reacts to this
 raksha mantralay ke think-tanks institute of dephence studies and analysis (idise) ke ek vidwaan lakshmana kumaar behara kehete hai, ‘‘pehle se hi sarkaar ke puure puunjigat kharch kaa 33 pratishat hissaa raksha mantralay ko chalaa jaataa he
 It is difficult to say why the Finance Ministry would like to increase this allocation

 Everybody is saluting their courage and fearlessness after the valiant wing commander Abhinandan, who demolished Pakistan's fighter aircraft, late Friday night
 isi kadi main congress netaa salmaan khurshid ne shanivaar der shaam ek twit kiya
 In this tweet, Khurshid was seen congratulating the wing commander and also taking credit that he was appointed during the UPA government
 salmaan khurshid ne likhaa ki wing commander abhinandan vartmaan ko bahut badhai, jinhone bharat kii taraf se dushman kaa saamana kiya
 He wrote, 'we are proud that Abhinandan became a Wing Commander in 2004 and a fighter pilot during the UPA Government
 'many kudos for Wing Commander abhi Varthaman the face of India’s resistance to enemy aggression
 Great poise and confidence in face of adversity
 We are proud that he received his wings in 2004 and matured as fighter pilot during UPA— Salman Khurshid (@salman7khurshid)march 2, 2019bataa den ki abhinandan neshnal dephence academy se graduate hai or 2004 main vah fiter plane payalat ke taur par vayusena main shaamil hue
 In the same year, the BJP led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee had to face defeat, and under the leadership of Manmohan Singh, the Congress government was formed
 salmaan khurshid ne apni sarkaar ke dauraan wing commander ke vayusena main aane kii baat hi apane liye garv kaa vishay bataaya he
 Earlier, in 2018, Salman Khurshid's party Congress had also tweeted a similar tweet about Sridevi
 congress ne shridevi kii maut par dukh jataate hue kaha tha ki 2013 main upie sarkaar ke dauraan hi unhen padmashri se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 This stance of the Congress party was severely criticized
 uttarakhand main floor test se thik pehle ek nae sting oparation ne harish ravat or congress ke liye mushkilen khadi kar di hai
 On Sunday evening, BJP leaders met Governor KK Paul on the matter and handed him a CD of Sting

 dehradun pahunche vijayawargeeyabijepi ke sheersh netaaon kaa maananaa he ki raajnneeti main do raaten kisi bhi game ko palatney ke liye kaaphi hoti hai
 In Uttarakhand, BJP in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya and Shyam Jaju have reached Dehradun and summoned party mlas on Monday
 haalanki, ummid nainital hai court par tiki hai, jahaan somvaar ko baagi vidhayakon par faisla aane vaala he
 Seal on the sting operation! It is said that the party strategists are in manipulations to somehow change the Congress camp mlas who are angry with Chief Minister Harish Rawat but are afraid to come forward during the floor test on Tuesday
 netaa is baat par muhar laga rahe hai ki baagi vidhayak harak singh ravat kii baatcheet kaa nayaa sting yah bataane ke liye kaaphi he ki kis tarah uttarakhand main kursi par kabje ke liye khulkar jod-tod jari he
 BJP confident of passing BJP feels that the government will be its own and Harish Rawat will fail the test, but how? Nobody is willing to disclose this strategy
 bijepi netaa bhagat singh koshiyaari ne to daawa kar diya he ki mukhyamantri bijepi kaa hoga, lekin koun ye shaayad wo bhi nahin jaanate
 Perhaps this is why he slowly told the right journalists that whomever you want will become him
 pratishtha kii ladaai main inako milegaa phaaydaphilhal somvaar ko sansad main bhi uttarakhand ke bajet paas karne se pehle halaat par charchaa honi he
 In this, the entire preparation of the opposition is to surround the government
 aise main ye do raaten rajya kii raajnneeti main chal rahe ghamaasan ke bich kaaphi ahm hai, kyonki donon partiyaan pratishtha kii ladaai ko jeetne ke liye kisi bhi had tak jaaengi or chaandi hogi un vidhayakon kii jo aas lagaae donon kii taraf dekh rahe hai

 udhar, videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa vikaas swaroop ne kaha he ki pakistan bharat main aatankwaad ko badhaava de rahaa he
 a spokesman for the Ministry of External Affairs says that Pakistan has no right to talk on Kashmir because Kashmir is an unbreakable part of India

 Jaishankar raised these five issues

 india-a team opener Shikhar Dhawan, who played a historic innings of 248 runs against South africa-a team on Monday, has said that he had the feeling that he has a chance to score a triple century and if he is in the 44th over Had he not been out, he might have achieved this position
 dhawan ne pratham shrenee cricket (ekadivasiy) main duusari or bharat ke liye sabase badi pari kheli
 Sachin Tendulkar (200 not out) and Virender Sehwag (219) have scored double centuries in one-day matches for India, but Dhawan set a new record for first-class cricket through his 150-ball innings
 dhawan ne match ke baad kaha, "mujhe is record ke bare main pataa tha or isse main bahut khush hum
 When i was out in the 44th over, it came to my mind that if i remained on the full 50 overs wicket, i could have crossed the 300-run mark
 vaise maine jo score kiya, usase behad khush hum
 " dhawan ne apni pari main 30 chauke or saat chakke lagaae
 Sehwag holds the record for the greatest innings in one-day cricket, but the record for the biggest innings in first-class matches is for Eddie Brown, a county club Surrey player who scored 268 against Glamorgan in 2002
 iske baad dhawan kaa naam darj ho chukaa he
 Third in the episode is Graeme Pollack, who scored 222 not out against the Border team in East London in 1974, playing for Eastern Province
 tippaniyan Did it ever come to mind to match Sachin and Sehwag in one-day matches? When asked, Dhawan said, "the innings of Sachin and Sehwag are many times better than my innings as both have scored double centuries in international cricket
 200 ranon kaa aankada paar karte hi main samaj gaya tha ki ab meraa naam in do diggajon ke saath jud chukaa he, jiske bare main maine sachmuch kabhi sochaa nahin tha

 Although Dhoni did not reveal any of his favorite bowlers for Monday's match, he indicated his intention by referring to the poor form of Yusuf Pathan
 yusuf kii form chintaa kaa vishay haiunhone kaha ‘‘yusuf main bahut pratibha he or unhone gharelu cricket or ipel main joardaar pradarshan kiya he lekin vah apni pratishtha ko antarrashtriya str par sabit nahin kar sake hai

 Now you also have to worry about what kind of fielding you will need in the next match and what are your options
 ’’ bhartiya captain ne kaha ‘‘yah bahut mushkil hota he lekin aap mujhe maidan main hairaan-pareshaan nahin dekhte, kyonki mujhe chunautiyaan pasand hai
 "dhoni also mentioned the misfortune that is chasing India recently

 lekin itihaas se jude tathyon kii galtiyaan karte aa rahe piem modi magahar main bhi yahi chook kar baithe
 In fact, Modi reached Maghar on the occasion of Kabir's 620th Prakash Day
 yahaan unhone sabase pehle kabir ko naman kiya or unki samadhi par chadar bhi chadhaai
 In the presence of UP Chief Minister Yogi and other BJP leaders, Modi also addressed a public meeting
 kabir hindu the yaa musalmaan? jaane unke jivan se judin badi batempiem modi ne kaha, "samaaj ko sadiyon se disha de rahe maardarshak, sambhaav or samarasata ke pratibimb mahatma kabir ko unki hi nirvana bhoomi se ek baar phir main unhen koti-koti naman karata hum
 It is said that this is where Saint Kabir, Guru Nanak Dev and Baba Gorakhnath sat together and had a spiritual discussion
 
 
 "bataa den ki modi ne jin teen mahapurushon ke ek saath baithkar charchaa karne kii baat kahi, vah tathyaatmak rup se sahi nahin he
 Because the era of Baba Gorakhnath is different from both saints
 kabir kii majaar par yogi ne nahin pahani topi, modi ne chadhaai chadarnath sampradaay kii sthapana karne vaale baba gorakhnath kaa jeevankaal, sant kabir or guru nanak se bahut pehle kaa he
 Baba Gorakhnath was born in the 11th century
 jabaki 120 saal jivit rahane vaale sant kabir kaa janm 14veen shatabdi (1398 se 1518) ke aakhir main hua tha

 Hear in the video below, Modi's factual mistakes have been made earlier too
 This is not the first time that Modi has made a mistake while stating the fact of history in his speech

 Whereas the fact is that Taxila has been a part of Punjab and is now in Pakistan
 america daure main bhi itihaas ke tathy ko bhi piem modi ne galat pesh kar diya tha
 In his speech, he described the Sun Temple of Konark as 2000 years old while it is 700 years old
 modi ne ek baar kaha tha ki jab ham gupt samrajya kii baat karte hai ki hamen chandragupta kii raajnneeti kii yaad aati he
 Actually, the Chandragupta Modi was referring to and his politics belonged to the Maurya dynasty

 Banned on 500 and 1000 rupee notes, on the other hand Donald Trump bets on defeating Hillary Clinton in presidential elections in USA Scope of and was elected the 45th president of the United States
 aisi do badi ghatnaayen jab ek hi din main saamne ai, to log apane style main soshal media par apni raay jaahir karne main lag gaye
 Some jokes came out and some long stories
 lekinrishi kapoor apnessingle line twit se sabakaa dhyaan apni taraf khinch liya
 On her Twitter account, Rishi wrote, 'in these last two days the world's largest democracies have gone from black to white!' With this one statement, the sage struck a sarcasm on India's black money, which would turn into white because of Modi's move
 or unka doosraa ishaara tha america kii taraf jahaan baraak obama kii bajaay ab raashtrapati banakar aae hai donald trump
 In the last 2 days, two of the world's largest democracies have gone from black to white
 — Rishi Kapoor (@chintskap)november 10, 2016haalanki yah koi naslvaadi tippanee nahin thi, lekin phir bhi kuch logon netwitor par rishike is statement par coment karte hue kaha ki khud ek public figure hote hue unhen aise statement nahin dene chahie

 They are afraid that the police will pick them up during the night
 ‘main ghar main sone main darataa hum sahab
 The policeman abuses us
 wo mujhe yahaan se pakad kar le janaa chahta he
 i run away after seeing him
 ’ In the villages of Bastar, this panic is about surrender
 jagadalpur se koi 100 kilometre dur sukama ke bade gurbe gaanv main pahunchate hi adivasee apana apana dukhada sunaane lagate hai
 People gathered here from around half a dozen villages accuse, the police are forcibly surrendering as Maoists or their supporters
 jangmpal gaanv ke madkaaraam sodhi kehete hai ki akhabaaron main aa rahi sarender kii khabaren juthi hai
 Sodhi fears that the tribals of Bastar will flee their villages for fear of the police
 pichley dinon bade gurbe gaanv ke koi baarah hazaar logon ne sukama ke paas kookanar thane main bada virodh pradarshan kiya
 People had alleged that the police were pressurizing Ayatharam Mandavi, a tribal of big gurbe, to surrender as a Naxal supporter
 ‘jab maine samarpan karne se manaa kiya to police ne mujhe dhamkaana shuru kar diya
 When i ran away from home, the police came looking for me and took my wife away
 uske baad baarah hazaar adivaasiyon ne thane par pradarshan kiya
 ' police in aaropon se inkaar karti he
 But Importaram reached Raipur with his wife and held a press conference and alleged that many tribals are under pressure to surrender
 is saal bastar main ab tak kareeb 400 sarender ho chuke hai
 These surrenders have already been questioned
 zyaadaatar logon par koi mukadmaa nahin chal rahaa yaa unke khilaaf koi warrant bhi nahin he
 Most of the tribals are guilty of minor offenses
 pendalnar gaanv main ek adivasee erraaram markaam ne hamase kaha, ‘police yahaan aakar un adivaasiyon ko pakad rahi he, jo nirdosh hai
 They stand up, tie a cloth to their mouth, hold a gun in their hands and take photographs and then present them as surrendered Maoists
 ’ NDTV India visited several villages in Bastar to investigate the entire matter
 yah sahi he ki samarpan karne vaale zyaadaatar adivasee na to naksali hai or na naksaliyon ke samarthak
 But Maoism is under suspicion because of being in the affected zone
 inamen se kai logon ne mana ki maovadiyon ke prabhaav vaale ilaake main kabhi-kabhi unke dabaav main chote-mote kaam karne padate hai, jaise unke liye rashan laana yaa phir unhen khaanaa khilaanaa
 'nobody is an active supporter of Maoists, but the police suspect us
 agar police vaale is gaanv main aa jaaen to khaanaa to unhen bhi ham khilaate hai’
 Hannuram of Gorali village told us
 lekin aisa nahin he ki pichley 6 maheenon main saare sarender farzi hue hai
 The active cadre of Maoists have also taken up arms
 jagadalpur main hamaari mulaakaat sarita or sanpat maharu se hui, jinhone november main bijapur ke bhairamgarh main hathiyaar daale
 Both Sarita and Sampat have been commanders of the 16th Palatoon of the PLGA and have been members of the CPI (maoist) for the past nine years
 unhone hamase baatcheet main mana ki unhone kai maovadi hamalon main hissaa liya
 Although they have received only Rs
 5-5 thousand, but the police has assured that it will be settled under the surrender policy of the state government
 bastar ke aiji esarapy kalluri farzi sarender yaa dabaav daalane ke kisi bhi aarope ko galat bataate hai
 'those who do not know about Maoism do not know that there are many front of Maoists
 misaal ke taur par chetana natya manch or dandakarany mazdoor kisaan sangh kaa hinsa se to koi lenaa-dena nahin, lekin wo maovadi vichaardhaara ko aage badhaate hai
 The government has banned many such organizations
 agar unamem se kuch log aakar samarpan kar rahe hai to media or kai log ye sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki in logon ke khilaaf to koi mukadmaa nahin he
 These people have never ambushed
 koi goli nahin chalaai
 Did not even slap anyone
 inako kaise sarender maovadi ke taur par dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 This is a wrong understanding
 jo bhi log maowad se kisi bhi tarah se jude hai, unhen ham waapas mukhyadhara main laana chaah rahe hai or jab wo log samarpan karte hai to sawaal uthta he ki ham farzi sarender karvaa rahe hai
 ' ai ji kalluri ne kaha ki, ‘main bastar ke naksaliyon ko naksali nahin kahata
 i say victims of Naxalism, because people from outside have come here and spread Maoism
 gudsa usendi jaise bade maovadi netaa (gudsa usendi mul rup se telugu he) jab andhra pradesh main jaakar sarender kar sakate hai to ham apane gond adivaasiyon ko kyon hathiyaar na dalawaaen
 These Maoists join them by tricking them
 ham unhen waapas laana chaahate hai’
 But the police department in Chhattisgarh also has two opinions on this method of surrender
 bade adhikariyon kaa ek dhada ye maanata he ki is tarah se karaae ja rahe sarender aatmghaatee sabit honge, kyonki sarender karne vaale logon ke paas waapas gaanv main jane kaa vikalp nahin bachataa or agar unhen punarvaas niti ke tahat muaavja nahin diya ja sakaa to phir wo shahari zidagi kaise bitaa paaegein

 cinema main ramayana kaa ek anoothaa itihaas rahaa he
 Many directors have engraved this story with their creativity on screen
 ramayana se judi filmein naa keval superhit raheen balki isse jude tivi serials ne kai str par record tod die
 The special thing is that the film on Ramayana was released before the independence of India
 saal 1943 main ai is film kaa naam 'ram rajya' tha
 The film was directed by Vijay Bhatt
 film main ram or sita ke role main prem aadeeb or shobhana samarth ne kaam kiya tha
 The film became the third highest grossing film of that year
 ye pehali bhartiya film thi jiskaa premier america main hua tha
 Why Mahatma Gandhi did not like the film? It is worth mentioning that this film became very popular in the country and the show of this film was put on 2 June 1944 for Mahatma Gandhi
 mana jaataa he ki is film ko gandhi ne pehle sirf aadhe ghante ke liye hi dekhne kaa plan kiya tha lekin jab unhone is film ko dekhnaa shuru kiya to unhone ise puraa dekh liya tha
 However, in this case, Shanti Kumar says that Gandhi did not like this film at all because he did not like the noise and the screaming in the film
 gandhi ne kaha tha ki mujhe ek hindi film dekhni hi hogi kyonki maine ek english film dekhne kii galati kar di he
 The film had gained a lot of popularity and this film had many uses on Baadramayan
 anemated ramayana se lekar ramayana main maujuud kai kirdaaron par kai kahaniyaan bani he or aaj bhi ye filmein logon kaa manoranjan kar rahi hai

 In order to deal with such a situation, Gmail is preparing to bring a warning system so that users can be alerted if such mail arrives

 The country gained independence on 15 August 1947, 73 years from today
 ye din puri duniya main bharat ke swatantraaa diwas ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 But, you will be surprised to know that somewhere in this country, Independence Day is also celebrated on 18 August
 jaane, iske peeche kii rochak kahani
 This was because of 12 August 1947
 tab ol india radio par khabar ai ki bharat ko aazaadee mil gai he
 Along with this came news of partition
 is khabar main zikr aayaa pashchim bengal ke nadiya jile kaa, khabar ke mutabik yahaan ke nadiya jile ko pakistan main shaamil kiya ja rahaa tha
 After this news on the radio, rebellion started in the area of hindu-dominated Nadia
 pashchim bengal ke nadiya jile ko lekar ye prashasnic galati hui thi
 This mistake was given to the officer who was given the responsibility of fixing the boundary line between India and Pakistan
 angrej afasar sar redcliff ne pehali baar main galat nakshaa bana diya tha jisase nadiya jile ko pakistan main shaamil dikhaa diya gaya
 In this way Nadia district was included in East Pakistan
 bataa den ki aazaadee se pehle nadiya main paanch sab divijan krishnanagar sadar, meharpur, kushtiya, chuadanga or ranaghat aate the
 In partition these areas, which are presently cities, were included in East Pakistan
 is khabar ke failane ke baad nadiya main dange bhadak uthe
 There was a stir for two days due to the protests of angry people
 zyaadaatar log british hukumat ke faisle ke virodh main sadak par utar aae the
 Here the women did not burn even the stove in the houses for two days
 ek tarah se yahaan do dharmon ke bich yuddh jaise halaat ban gaye the
 On the other hand, Muslims in Nadia district were excited about the news of their inclusion in Pakistan
 pehle nadiya jile ko purvi pakistan main shaamil kiye jane ko lekar khabar ai thi
 Not only this, some leaders of the Muslim League hoisted Pakistani flags at Krishnanagar Public Library along with their supporters
 yahaan netaaon ne reliyaan nikaalin or pakistan jindabad ke naare lagane lage
 This had made the situation worse
 british hukumat ko badalanaa padaa faislailaake main bigadate halaat ab kaabo se baahar the
 The general public revolt increased so much that the British government had to withdraw its decision
 hua yun ki nadiya jile main vidroh kii khabar jab desh ke antim vysarai lord mountbeton tak pahunchi to unhone redcliff ko tatkaal apni galati sudhaarney ke aadesh die
 Now Radcliffe made some changes to the map and Ranaghat, Krishnanagar in Nadia district, and Shikarpur of Karimpur were included in India
 haalanki is sudhaar prakriya main kuch vakt lag gaya
 In this way, after full paperwork, Nadia district joined India at midnight of 17 August
 wo isi din bharat kaa hissaa ban paae yahaan ke logon main utsaah or ilaake main khushiyaan manaai jaane lageen
 It was then recorded in history that after the decision to join District Hindustan, the flag of Pakistan was removed from Krishnanagar Library on August 18
 ab yahaan par bhartiya tirangaa fahraaya gaya
 While the tricolor was celebrated on 15 August in the whole country, the date of hoisting the tricolor changed here
 us vakt ke kanoon ke mutabik rashtradhvaj ke sammaan main aam naagarik sirf 23 janvari, 26 janvari or 15 agast ko hi jhanda fahraa sakate the
 But people here hoisted the flag on 18 August
 sawaal uthaa to de di chunauti18 agast ko aazaadee hasil karne ke nadiya jile ke sangharsh ko yaadgaar banane ke liye swatantraaa senaanee pramathanath shukul ke pote anjan shukul ne 18 agast ko hi swatantraaa diwas manaane ko chunauti de di
 After his long struggle, in 1991, the central government allowed him to hoist the flag in Nadia on 18 August
 tab se har saal nadiya jile or uske antargat aane vaale shaharon main 18 agast ko aazaadee kaa jashn manaaya jaataa he
 On the day of August 18, people celebrate this day with great fanfare
 yahaan jhandarohan bhi isi din kiya jaataa he
 Nurukushti has started in the Congress and BJP with preparations for the next Lok Sabha elections
 congress netaa pramod tiwari ne ravivaar ko loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaariyon ke liye bijepi kii ore se sabhi 543 siton par prabharee or booth adhyakshon kii niyukti ko lekar kataaksh kiya
 He said that the figure of 19 for the BJP is inauspicious
 vahiin bijepi netaa shahanvaj hossain ne chunavi taiyaariyon ko lekar party adhyaksh amit shah ke kaside padhe
 He said, 'our national president works 24 hours a day, all seven days
 subah se lekar 2 baje raat tak kaam karte hai or chunavi taiyaariyon ko lekar vah ab tak takreeban sabhi jilon kaa daura kar chuke hai
 Taking a jibe, Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said, '19 figure is inauspicious for BJP
 vah 2019 main dobaaraa satta main nahin aegi
 Because BJP government fell in Karnataka on 19, Telugu Desam separated from it on 19 and PDP-BJP coalition government fell on Kashmir on 19th
 ab 2019 main hi loksabhaa ke chunaav hai
 Therefore 19 is inauspicious for BJP
 'bijepi ne congress par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki congress ne chashma hi raajnneeti kaa pahana he
 Shahnawaz Hussain said in a conversation with Aaj Tak, 'congress has put spectacles in which it sees politics in everything
 raajnneeti vah karte nahin hai
 He does politics of Tafari, we do politics of service
 congress ko jab mauka miltaa he to vah apane liye satta kaa upyog karti he
 If Narendra Modi has a chance, he uses it for the country
 'congress-bijepi kii nurakushtipramod tiwari bhi 2019 ke chunaavon ko lekar congress kii taiyaariyon ko ginavane se peeche nahin rahe
 He said, 'congress preparation is better than Bharatiya Janata Party
 loksabhaa ke pehle 3 vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Among these are Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 kya hamane vahaan par chunaav samiti nahin ghoshit kar di? kya hamane vahaan taiyaariyaan nahin shuru kar di? to ham bhartiya janata party se chunaav ke maamle main bahut aage hai
 We know that we are winning Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 'vahiin shahanvaj hossain bhi congress kii chutki lene se nahin chuke
 He said that most of the Congress leaders are on leave due to summer
 agar congress ke netaa bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii carbon copy bhi kar len to bhi unki party kaa bhala ho jaae
 In view of the election of 19, Amit Shah himself is visiting every state
 test series main haar kaa asar team india par kitna hua he, yah ravivaar ko pataa chal jayega
 
 
 The contest is against Australia and the home challenge from the Kangaroos will not be easy
 
 
 itnaa hi nahin, van-de main team india kii kamyaabi kaa raaj uske ballebaaz rahe hai, lekin khatm hui test series kii sapaat pichon par bhi bharat ke ballebaaz sangharsh karte rahe or yahi chintaa kii baat he
 
 
 But former captain Sunil Gavaskar's confidence in Team India's batting is intact
 
 
 unhone kaha ki bharat kii ballebaazi main vah dam he ki van-de main zordaar vaapasi kar sake
 
 
 This is not the first time that Team India will play a one-day tournament after the Test failure
 
 
 sunil gavaskar kii baat sahi bhi sabit ho sakati he, lekin yah or baat he ki gendbaazi par sawaal ab bhi barkaraar hai or australian maidaanon par bharat kii samasya zyaada bad sakati he, khaskar in pichon par, jahaan bharat ke spin gendbaazon ko bilkul madad nahin milegi or maidan kaaphi bade hone kii vajah se fielderon par bhi dabaav hameshaa rahegaa
 
 
 Team India is still looking for its first major win on this tour, and it is quite possible that the tonic of victory in the first match of the tri-series will give a new life to Team India
 
 
 katak main pehle ekadivasiy match main bhartiya jeet ke nayak rahe rohit sharma ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki lakshya tak pahunchane kaa kaam puchhlle ballebaajon ke liye chhodana unki galati thi or vah ise kabhi nahin doharaana chahenge
 Rohit scored 72 off 99 balls, despite which the team was able to achieve the target of 212 runs despite the initial stuttering
 lekin bharat kaa score jab 201 ran tha tab rohit out ho gayi the jiske baad umesh yadav or varun aaron kii antim jodi ne team ko jeet dilaayi
 On the eve of the second ODI against the West Indies here tomorrow, i was a little disappointed that i could not finish the match
 jeetna mahatvapurn he
 If you make good runs and the team loses then it makes no sense
 main phir se kabhi aisi galati nahin karnaa chaahunga
 Rohit said, it was difficult for the bowlers to entrust the task of scoring runs
 mujhe yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki aage aisa nahin ho
 However, the middle order batsman was satisfied with scoring a half-century
 unhone kaha, isamen andeh nahin ki yah kareebi match tha lekin yah myne nahin rakhata kyonki ham jeetne main safal rahe jo ki mahatvapurn he
 We had a very good start and i and Ravindra Jadeja focused on partnering in such a situation
 unhone kaha, maine match kii mukhya ansh dekhe or ravi shastri ne varun or umesh ke bare main kaaphi acchhee baaten kii
 It is good that two fast bowlers are consistently doing well, they are doing well
 mujhe vishwaas he ki unka bhavishya ujjwal he
 It is expected that they will continue to perform well in the beginning and bring success to the team
 rohit ne kaha ki team vijay abhiyaan jari rakhana chaahegi
 He said, we would like to continue the campaign of victory in this match also
 hamane acchhee taiyaariyaan kii he
 We want to enjoy the game
 jab surya or chandramaa ke bich prithvi aa jaati he to surya kii puri roshni chandramaa par nahin padati he
 This is called lunar eclipse
 jab surya, prithvi or chandramaa ek saral rekha main hote hai to chandragrahan kii sthiti hoti he
 In addition, when the Moon passes through the darkest or darkest shadow of the Earth, it is the longest-lived lunar eclipse
 27 july ko hone vaala chandragrahan prithvi kii sabase kaali chaaya se hokar gujaregaa, jis vajah se ye sadi kaa sabase lanbaa chandragrahan mana ja rahaa he
 There are three types of lunar eclipses - Total Lunar Eclipse, Partial Lunar Eclipse and Penumbral Lunar Eclipse
 inamen sabase zyada prabhaavshaalee purna chandragrahan hota he, jo 27 july ko padane vaala he
 During full lunar eclipse, the Earth's shadow completely covers the moon
 sadi kaa sabase lanbaa chandragrahan, dhyaan main rakhen ye batengrahan chaahe suraj par laga ho yaa chand par, itihaas main grahan ko lekar logon ke man kaaphi dar dekha gaya he
 People fear the most when the moon turns red during the full lunar eclipse
 iskaa ek kaaran yah bhi he ki kai logon ko grahan ke bare main zyada jaankaree nahin hoti he or vah grahan ke liye bhagwaan ko jimmedaar tehraate hai
 Know, when the next lunar eclipse will happen? - 31 January 2018: The first full lunar eclipse of the year has been started on 31 January 2018
 yah chandragrahan asia, australia, pacific osian, western north america se dikhaai diya tha
 - 27 July 2018: The second lunar eclipse of the year is going to happen on Friday 27 July
 yah 21veen sadi kaa sabase lanbaa chandragrahan hoga
 Apart from India, this lunar eclipse will be visible from Africa, South Asia, Australia and South America
 lekin bharat main yah chandragrahan shuruyaat se lekar ant tak dekhne ko milegaa
 It is believed to be the last lunar eclipse of this year
 kya chandragrahan ko nangi ankhon se dekhnaa surakshit he?- 19 janvari 2019:saal 2018 ke baad purna chandragrahan agle saal yani 2019 main 19 janvari ke din padegaa
 This lunar eclipse will be seen from North and South America, Europe and Africa
 - 16 july 2019:16 july ko saal 2019 kaa doosraa chandragrahan hoga
 This will be an incomplete lunar eclipse
 yah chandragrahan dakshin america, europe, africa, asia or australia se dikhaai degaa
 How many lunar eclipses will be in the 21st century? NASA has released a list by predicting the lunar eclipse till the year 2100
 isamen unhone pichley sabhi chandragrahan kii jaankaree di he
 According to the Space Agency, there will be about 228 lunar eclipses during the 21st century
 rajyon kii vidhansabhaon ke adhyakshon or sabhapatiyon ke saath buudhvaar ko baithak ke baad loksabhaa adhyaksh om birla ne kaha, sabhi log is baat ko lekar ekamat hai ki sadan main kaam zyada hona chahie, vyavdhaan nahin hona chahie
 In order to ensure that there is no disturbance in the functioning of the house, a committee has been formed to make a code of conduct which will report
 loksabhaa adhyaksh ne aage kaha, 'kanoon banate vakt charchaa honi chahie, sarthak charchaa honi chahie balki kshetra ke muddon par charchaa honi chahie
 L' Ekin should not interfere with the functioning of the House
 iske liye code of conduct banane par baatcheet hui he
 For this, a committee of Legislative Assembly will be formed which will interact with all the Speaker of the Assembly and submit their report in the meeting of the Chairmen to be held in Dehradun
 isi report ke aadhaar par antim nirnay hoga
 Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, after a meeting with the chairmen and chairmen of the state assemblies, said that the opposition has the right to speak, as well as the right to speak and the stronger the opposition, the stronger the democracy
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki vipaksh sadan main narebaaji kare or wel main aakar hangaamaa kare
 Speaker Om Birla further said, "the House runs by the Constitution and works according to the Constitution

 ek taraf odisha main piem modi ne pichde muslimon ke sammelan karne kii baat kahi to vahiin bijepi telugana main pichde musalamaanon kaa aarakshan badaye jane ke bill kaa virodh karti nazar ai, lekin rajya vidhansabha main chandrashekhar raav sarkaar yah aarakshan badhwane main kaamyaab rahi
 Chief Minister k Chandrasekhar Rao said in the assembly that now it will be sent for the approval of the President
 is vidheyak ke tahat anusuchit janajati ke liye aarakshan ko maujuuda 6 fisadi se badhaakar 10 fisadi kar diya gaya he jabaki bisi-i (muslim samudaay ke pichhadaa varg) ke liye ise maujuuda 4 fisadi se badhaakar 12 fisadi kar diya gaya he
 As a result, the total reservation in the state will increase from the current 50 percent to 62 percent
 iske baad rajya main kul aarakshan 62 pratishat pahunch gaya he jo supreme court kii 50% kii seemaa se zyaada he
 However, this bill needs the President's approval to become law

 BJP spokesperson Krishna Sagar Rao said, "it will be canceled at the beginning of the central government level
" raav ne kaha, dharm aarakshan dene kaa aadhaar nahin ho saktaa he or kanoonee taur par yah vyavhaarik nahin he kyonki ucch nyaayalay or ucchtam nyaayalay ne aarakshan kii seemaa 50 fisadi tay rakhi he
 He said, the local BJP unit will challenge this bill in court
 unhone prakriya kaa paalan nahin kiya or isliye yah vidheyak raddi ke tukade kii tarah he, isaki koi vaidhata nahin he
 Rao said, it will not survive the scrutiny of the courts

 unhone kaha ki ham dharm ke aadhaar par aarakshan kaa virodh isliye nahin kar rahe, kyonki kesiar (telugana ke mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav) ise lagu karnaa chaahate hai

 bhaajapa pravaktaa krishna sagar raav ne bataaya, centre sarkaar ke str par yah shuruyaat main hi radd kar diya jayega
 Rao said, religion cannot be the basis for granting reservation and legally it is not practical as the High Court and Supreme Court have set the reservation limit at 50 per cent
 unhone kaha, sthaneey bhaajapa ikai is vidhyek ko adaalat main chunauti degi
 They did not follow the procedure and hence this bill is like a piece of waste, it has no validity
 raav ne kaha, yah adaalaton kii jaanch ke samaksh tik nahin paaegaa
 He said that this issue was also raised and discussed in the BJP National Executive held in Bhubaneshwar
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ke varisht netaa venkaiya naidu ne kaha tha ki desh main dharm aadhaarit aarakshan lagu karne se saamaajik ashaanti paidaa ho sakati he or isse ‘ek or pakistan ban saktaa he
 Addressing a BJP meeting on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti, Naidu also hinted that Telangana's recent proposal to increase reservation for some sections may not be constitutionally valid
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki samvidhan nirmaataa biaar ambedkar ne dharm aadhaarit aarakshan kaa virodh kiya tha
 He said that we are not opposing reservation on the basis of religion, because KCR (telangana Chief Minister k Chandrasekhar Rao) wants to implement it
 (inputs bhashaa se bhi) Significantly, senior BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu had said that the implementation of religion-based reservation in the country could create social unrest and 'create another Pakistan'

 Vikas Bahl managed to make tremendous headlines from Kangana Ranaut's film Queen
 desh ke purush pradhan samaaj ke dabadabe ke bich progressive, feminist or antertaning film banaakar vikaas ne logon kaa acha manoranjan kiya tha
 This wonderful film not only named Vikas Bahl in the industry but also played an important role in establishing Kangana
 ab vikaas bahal ruthik roshan ke saath anand kumaar kii jaadui kahani parde par lekar aae hai
 However, Vikas Bahl seems unable to replicate the queen's magic through Super 30
 jabaki anand kumaar kii jabardast kahani main queen jaisaa jaadu dohraane kaa shandaar mauka tha
 The Super 30 begins with a flashback
 ek behtareen student anand kumaar kaa admician crabinge uniwarsity main hota he, lekin aarthik sthiti kharaab hone ke chalate wo daakhila nahin le paata he
 Anand's father dies and has to run a house selling papad made by his mother
 haalanki anand kii kismat badalati he jab unhen lallan singh kaa saath miltaa he
 Lallan Singh is played by Aditya Srivastava
 lallan iaiti kii taiyaari kar rahe bacchon ke liye ek koching centre chalaata he or anand ko bataur teacher shaamil kar letaa he
 However, when Anand realizes that many children like him are sacrificing their dreams due to financial constraints, they leave their comfortable life and open a free coaching center
 ruthik roshan ne anand kumaar lagane kii koshish kii he, lekin apane brown mechap shades main ve kai seens main prabhavi nahin lagate hai
 While his skin was taken care of, the actor's eyes were not noticed
 film main ruthik kii natural hari ankhen ehsaas nahin hone detii ki ve ruthik nahin balki anand kumaar hai
 Hrithik's Bihari accent is interesting to listen to and he is quite successful in playing this role
 ruthik kaa kaam badhiya he
 His hard work for the role is also visible
 pankaj treepathi film main ajukeshan ministar ke taur par dikhte hai jinka koching bijness shandaar chal rahaa he vahiin mrinal ke paas thode se screen spes main khaas kuch karne ko nahin tha
 But she looks effective in scenes with Hrithik
 anuraag kashyap kii kai filmon main najar aa chuke aditya shrivastav apni adaakaari se ek baar phir chaunkaate hai
 This 2 hour 42 minute film seems a bit long
 film main ruthik kii mrinal ke saath lav story vaala hissaa is kahani main koi praasangikta nahin rakhata he
 Some parts of Super 30 seem more dramatic
 masalan ek baccha jo anand ke super 30 kaa hissaa hone se ek number se rah jaataa he, wo naa keval kuch ghanton kii mehnat ke baad shandaar musical parformens detaa he balki kai maheenon kii training kaa hissaa naa banane ke baad bhi iaiti kaa exam nikaal detaa he
 Super 30 under Anand Kumar has done wonders across the country
 haalanki vikaas bahal ke netritv main ye film apana kamaal dikhaa paane main kahin naa kahin chook jaati he
 Ganesh Chaturthi 2017: Know when is the auspicious time of Ganpati Visarjan and what is its significance to reach the truth Shraddha
 
 
 satya tak pahunchane kaa maarg he shraadh
 
 
 It is believed that the Kalash is the image of Lord Ganesha
 isliye sabase pehle kalash kaa pujan kiya jaataa he
 Anyway, the first destroyer Shri Ganesh, as scriptural, is worshiped
 kalash ko kisi sthaan par sthapit karne se pehle puja-sthaan ko gangaajal se shuddh kiya jaataa he
 Then in this puja, all the gods and goddesses are called by the scriptural method that they should join this puja and take their place
 ullekhneey he ki navaratri pratipada tithi ko maa durga ke pratham swarup devi shailaputree kii puja kii jaati he
 The place of worship is purified with Ganges water before the Kalash is installed at some place
 phir is puja main samast devi-devataaon shastrokt vidhi se aahvaan kiya jaataa he ki ve is puja main sammilit hon or apana sthaan grahan karen
 It is noteworthy that on the Navratri Pratipada date, Goddess Shailputri is worshiped as the first form of Mother Durga

 uttar pradesh main chal rahe maujuuda vidhansatr ke dauraan sadan main pehali baar pahunche nae mananeeyon ko samajhane main hi vidhansabha adhyaksh kaaphi pareshaan ho jate hai
 Sometimes it even comes to scolding, then the attitude of the new legislators softens somewhat
 'adhyaksh ji
 
 pehali baar chunakar sadan main aayaa hum
 Give me a chance to speak ' ek navnirvaachit sadsy vidhansabha adhyaksh mata prasad pandeya se bolne dene kaa aagrah karte hai lekin badale main vidhayak ji ko daantate hue adhyaksh ji kehete hai, 'are kaise khadey ho gaye? kis niyam ke tahat bol rahe hai? aisa thode hi hota he
 Read the manual first
 'vidhansabha main is tarah ke paridrishy aksar dekhe ja sakate hai
 Throughout the day, many mlas stand up and ask permission to speak to the Speaker, but after the rebuke of the Speaker, they also sit quietly
 uttar pradesh kii 16veen vidhansabha main is baar 167 sadsy pehali baar chunakar aae hai
 He does not know anything about the rules of proceedings in the Assembly
 lekin samasya yah he ki unhen apane kshetra kii samasyaayein bhi uthaani hoti hai
 So they keep looking for an opportunity to speak
 vidhansabha main pehali baar chunakar aae nae sadasyon main mahilaayein bhi purushon se peeche nahin hai
 She too tries her best to get a chance to speak but does not get a chance
 kuch din pehle hi bhaajapa ke navnirvaachit vidhayak upendra tiwari bolne kii anumati na milane par sadan main hi dharne par baith gaye the
 He complained that he was not being given a chance to speak
 baad main party ke varisht netaaon ke kehane par haalanki unhone apana dharna samaapt kar diya tha
 Like Upendra Tiwari, hundreds of mlas have come to the House for the first time
 vah chaahate hai ki pradesh ke yuva mukhyamantri ke saamne unhen bhi bolne kaa mauka mili lekin afsos unki hasarat adhuri hi rah jaati he
 Hon'ble guests who reach the House for the first time do not care about the rules, but when they come to know that the matter is going out of the way now, they also become calm at the behest of the seniors
 or phir niyam pataa karne kii duhai dene lagate hai
 If this does not help, then the president's scolding makes him calm
 vidhansabha main pehali baar sadan main aae ek mananeey ne vidhansabha adhyaksh kii ore mukhaatib hokar shikaayat bhare lahaze main kaha, 'ab pehali baar chunakar aae hai, mauka dijiega tabhi to seekhenge
 If you are not allowed to speak now, what will you learn? 'vidhansabha main bolne kii anumati ke alaava satr kii sidhi kaarywahi ke prasaaran kii maang bhi nae vidhayakon ne uthaayi he
 a member of the BSP in the Assembly demanded from the Speaker that the proceedings of the Assembly should be shown live in the same manner as the Parliament proceedings so that the people of the state also know what their representatives are doing in the House
 vidhayak ke is sawaal ke jawaab main adhyaksh ne kaha ki yahaan sansad kii tarah bajet nahin he ki alag se channel kholkar sidhi kaarywahi dikhaai ja sake
 It is noteworthy that even before the start of the assembly session, a training program was organized for the new Hon'ble by the Legislative Assembly Secretariat in the third week of May, in which several veteran leaders including BJP national leader Sushma Swaraj sent the new mlas to the house
 The proceedings were told about the specifics, but the demand for speaking on the new mlas is so overshadowed that they are always looking for opportunity

 That's why the trade is closed

 Amidst all this, a discussion that is natural is that who will be the CM of UP? Who will BJP make UP Chief Minister? The name on which the needle of speculation stays is Amit Shah
 amit shah bhaajapa ke adhyaksh hai
 Modi's Hanuman is called
 unke manager ke taur par dekhe jate hai
 After the defeat of Bihar and Delhi, up's victory is a big victory and a gift is made in return for this victory
 to kya modi ab amit shah ko upi kaa singhaasana saunpkar unhen sammanit kar sakate hai
 Experts believe that its possibility cannot be ruled out
 haalanki amit shah ne khud ye kaha he ki upi kaa siem yaheen kaa koi cheharaa banegaa
 Why Amit Shah can become CM in UP? The pair of Amit Shah and Modi after 2014 has done wonders once again in 2017
 maujuuda vakt main modi ke sabase vishwasaneey amit shah hai
 After winning UP, Modi's entire focus will be to prepare UP for 2019, in which Amit Shah can be given the command of the state
 upi ko kitna samajhate hai shakhmit shah 2012 main pehali baar upi main sanghathan ke kaam ke liye puri tarah se jute the
 It is said that by the time of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Shah had become familiar with each region, constituency, assembly and parliamentary constituency in UP
 unhone puraa sameekaran banaaya
 The entire structure was created behind Kashi contesting Modi and then assuring victory
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki bijepi upi main loksabhaa chunaav main 73 seat hasil karne main kaamyaab rahi
 Not only will Shah's head win victory, Shah will also become a partner of this victory
 is bich, kendriya mantri piyush goyal ne shanivaar ko ek bayaan diya- amit shah ne upi chunaav main shilpkaar kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 Let us tell that Shah constantly weakened the BSP to garner votes of obcs and backward castes
 ek ranneeti ke tahat hi unhone keshav prasad maurya ko pradesh kaa adhyaksh banaaya, swami prasad maurya ko basapa se bijepi main laae
 What is Shah's role right now? The bjp's national politics and leadership changed as soon as Modi became PM in 2014
 rajnath singh grahamantri bane or party adhyaksh pad choda
 Shah took over as party president after the approval of the RSS
 nikaay chunaav se lekar maharashtra, haryana, assam, upi, uttarakhand jaise rajyon main jeet ke alaava bengal, karnataka jaise rajyon main party ko majboot hi kiya he
 However, in the meantime, he also suffered defeat in Delhi and Bihar
 25 janvari 2016 ko shah phir party president chune gaye
 His term in this post is till 2019
 aise main ho saktaa he ki modi unhen upi main party kaa cheharaa banaaen

" yadi yah ho rahaa he to yah acha nahin he
 In the Assembly, the BJP is showing its unease about the fact that despite having 105 mlas, it could not form a government, but it is best to ignore the attitude of the BJP due to this inconvenience
 'shivasena ne kaha ki rajya ke log is baat ko lekar ekamat hai ki fadanvis jo kuch bhi bol rahe hai, vah anaavashyak he
 The Shiv Sena-led government is in the majority and the Chief Minister has proved this in the Assembly
 party ne kaha, ‘fadanvis kaa kahana he ki rajya sarkaar apane vaade puure nahin kar rahi or kisaanon ke liye kuch nahin kar rahi, lekin kya modi sarkaar ne har naagarik ke khate main 15 lakh rupye hastantarit karne kaa vaada puraa kiya
 If this had happened, the farmers would have been happy as it would have removed their debt

 He said that we have seen a glimpse of it
 jab chandrashekhar desh ke pradhanmantri bane to unke vitt sachiv ne unase kaha ki hamaare paas maatr 21 din kaa videshi mudra bhandar he
 How will it work in such a situation? This happened because the earlier governments only spent and kept avoiding the difficult questions facing the country
 tab chandrashekhar ne himmat dikhaai or desh kaa sona girvee rakhkar desh kii saakh bachaai
 If they had not taken that step then we would not have stood here today
 duniya ke kai deshon kii tarah kangaal ho gaye hote

 Salary facilities of mps are notoriously infamous
 i believe that mps should get necessary facilities to do their work

 i also believe that mps should not get more than they need

 Parliament and courts should respect each other's extent: The constitution makers have clearly divided the work of judiciary, executive and legislature

 My personal opinion is that Gandhi's model is right for this country
 jab desh aaazaad hua to patrakaron ne gandhi se poocha ki kya aap bharat ko britain jaisaa bananaa chahenge to unhone kaha tha-britain bhoga bhoomi he
 India is the land of karma
 britain ne apane bhoga ke liye duniya ke kai deshon ko apana gulam banaaya
 We will not do this at all

 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar criticized the statement saying that such language does not suit the Prime Minister of the country
 ahmednagar main press ko sambodhit karne hue ensipi pramukh or purv kendriya krishi mantri sharad pavaar ne kaha ki is tarah kii bhashaa desh ke pradhanmantri ko shobhaa nahin detii
 In fact, the Center should provide financial assistance to those states which are waiving the debt of farmers
 lekin aisa karne ke bajaae pradhanmantri kisaanon ko raahat pahunchane ke prayaason kaa majaak uda rahe hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks came after the Congress governments announced debt waivers after the assembly elections in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh
 bataa den ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shanivaar ko uttar pradesh ke gajipur main ek kaarykram ke dauraan congress par karjamaafee ke jariye kisaanon ko gumraah karne kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki rajyon main congress kii sarkaron ne chunaav se pehle kiye gaye vaade ko puraa karne ke bajaay lollypop thamaya
 The Prime Minister claimed that only 800 farmers' debt was waived after the congress-jd (S) government came to power in Karnataka
 vahiin pradhanmantri ke is daawey ko khaarij karte hue karnataka ke mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami ne bhi unke bayaan ko galat, asamvedansheel or tathy se pare bataaya
 Kumaraswamy issued a press release point-by-point to the Prime Minister's accusations and said that the Government of Karnataka is keeping the promise of loan waiver to protect the interests of the farmers and till now the benefit of loan waiver has reached 60,000 farmers

 a post shared by Ankita Lokhande (@lokhandeankita) on Dec 13, 2018 at 3:11am PSTA post shared by Ankita Lokhande (@lokhandeankita) on Dec 16, 2018 at 11:58pm PST BJP President Amit Shah has given clarification for the first time on the questions being raised about the turnover of his son Jai Shah's company
 amit shah ne gujarat chunaav ko lekar yojit panchayat ajtak main managing editor rahul kanwal ke sawaalon ke jawaab main saaf kaha ki jai shah kii company main koi gadabadi nahin hui he jiskaa pramaan he unke dwaara sau karod kaa manahani kaa cese kyonki congress par aazaadee ke baad se itane aarope lagane ke baad bhi kabhi us party main itnaa naitik saahas nahin hua ki wo aisa cese kar paati
 Amit Shah was asked that it is alleged that the turnover of Jai Shah's company increased from 50 thousand to 80
 5 karod rupee ho gaya
 The opposition is asking how this happened? In response, Amit Shah said, 'well done you raised this question
 main aapke kaarykram ke madhyam se, pehle kuch sawaal uthaanaa chahta hum phir jawaab duungaa
 The Congress has been accused of so much corruption since independence ('
 
 
 or ye karpshan kaa aarope nahin he, kisi ne aisa aarope nahin lagaaya') lekin congress ne ek bhi manahani kaa, or sau karod kii manahani kaa cese kiya kya? nahin kiya to itani himmat kyon nahin hui? jai ne aaj aapraadhik manahani kaa cese file kiya he
 The Opposition is demanding an inquiry, Jai has asked for his own investigation, now reach the court with the facts you have
 court faisla karegi
 We have invited the inquiry itself, Amit Shah said, "let me make it clear first that the company has not done business of one rupee with the government, has not taken help of one rupee, has not taken government land nor brokerage like Bofors" If there is a gap, there is no question of corruption in it

 After PM Narendra Modi and former President Pranab Mukherjee, NITI Aayog also believes that elections to Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly will be held in two phases from 2024 onwards
 uske peeche tark yah diya ja rahaa he ki chunaav prachaar ke kaaran shashan main kam se kam vyavdhaan sunishchat ho sake
 Government think tank has said that it will be in national interest to hold both Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections simultaneously

" isamen adhiktam ek baar kuch vidhansabhaon ke kaarykaal main katautee kerani hogi yaa kuch ko kaarykaal vistaar dena hoga
 The report said that to implement it in the national interest, a special group of parties, including experts on the Constitution and experts on this matter, think tanks, government officials and representatives of various political parties, should be constituted which would recommend its implementation

 Prime Minister Modi has spoken in favor of it many times
 unhone yah bhi kaha he ki agar prastaav upyukt nahin ho to ise khaarij kiya ja saktaa he lekin is par charchaa honi chahie
 He, however, insisted that no decision in this regard should be imposed by the government
 purv raashtrapati mukherjee ne bhi loksabhaa or vidhansabhaon ke chunaav saath karaane kii baat kahi thi
 The former president had said, the time has come for positive discussion on electoral reforms
 samay aa gaya he ki dashakon puraane samay main laut jaaen, jab swatantraaa ke turant baad loksabhaa or vidhansabhaon ke chunaav saath-saath hote the
 He had said, now the Election Commission has to take it forward in consultation with political parties
 modi ne farvari main bhi donon chunaav ek saath karaane kii baat kahi thi
 He said that this will reduce expenditure
 unhone kaha tha ki raajnneetik dal ise anya najariye se na dekhen
 He had said that a party or government cannot do this, we all have to find a way together

 Modi also said that in the Lok Sabha elections in 2009, Rs 1,100 crore was spent and in 2014 this expenditure increased to Rs 4,000 crore
 unhone kaha tha ki badi sankhya main shikshakon sahit ek karod se adhik sarkari karmchaaree chunaav process main shaamil hote hai
 As this trend continues, the education sector suffers the most
 modi ne kaha tha ki suraksha balon ko bhi chunaav kaary main lagaana padataa he jabaki dushman desh ke khilaaf sajeesh rach rahe hai or aatankwaadi bada khatra bane hue hai

 In the Nirbhaya gang rape case, the Supreme Court will give its verdict on the review petition of three of the four convicts today
 2012 main rajdhani dilli main hue nirbhaya gangrape cese ne puure desh ko jhakzor diya tha
 Nirbhaya's brother recently became a pilot
 isko lekar nirbhaya kii maa aashaa devi ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa shukriya adaa kiya tha
 Asha Devi says that if Nirbhaya's brother is a pilot today, it is because of Rahul Gandhi
 mail today se baat karte hue unhone bataaya tha ki haadase ke baad unka puraa parivaar tutaa hua tha
 But Nirbhaya's brother did not deviate from his goal, he said that Rahul Gandhi not only sponsored his education but he used to call and motive him continuously
 nirbhaya kii maa ne mail today ko bataaya ki rahul ne lagaataar use salaah di or apane lakshya kaa peechha karne ko kaha
 When Rahul came to know that he wanted to join the army, it was Rahul who advised him to train the pilot after the end of school
 jab nirbhaya ke saath vah bheeshan haadasa hua tha, us dauraan uskaa bhai 12veen class main padhata tha
 After taking the CBSE examination in 2013, he took admission in Indira Gandhi National Flight Academy, Rae Bareli
 jiske baad vah raibareli hi shift ho gaya, use vahaan kaaphi mushkil ai
 Despite that, he did not back down
 apni 18 maheene kii training ke dauraan vah lagaataar nirbhaya cese se jude hue apadet le rahaa tha, isi bich rahul usase phone par baat karte the
 During this, Rahul told him never to quit
 nirbhaya kii mambolin ki ab uski padhai khatm ho gai he or gurugram main training chal rahi he
 He will soon fly the plane
 unhone bataaya ki rahul ke alaava unki bahan priyanka ne bhi kai baar usase phone par baat kii or uskaa haal chaal janaa
 Let us tell you that all the accused in the Nirbhaya case have been charged with rape and murder
 ek aaropee kii police castady main hi maut ho gai thi
 At the same time, four other accused were hanged
 ek naaballig aaropee ko teen saal ke liye sudhaar prakriya main bheja gaya tha
 Population There is an unprecedented wave of urbanization in India today
 bharat sarkaar kii 2011 kii janaganana ke anusaar kul 121 karod aabaadi main se 37
 71 crore people live in cities
 iske natijatan roti, kapadaa or makaan samet buniyadi jaruraton kii baari maang he
 This situation is expected to get worse in the future as the current 31 according to estimates
 1 fisadi kii dar ke mukaable 2030 tak shaharikaran kii dar 40 fisadi ko chhu jaaegi
 This urbanization is driving demand in essential parts of the economy like real estate and housing
 neshnal cemple survey ke 65wein daur ke nateezon main paaya gaya tha ki 9,90,000 log badtar halaat main ji rahe hai, 1
 49 crore are living in decaying houses and they need new houses
 desh main kareeb 1
 87 crore families are homeless
 aabaadi main ijapha, jameen kii kami or bheed bhari sadaken nai chunautiyaan lekar ai hai, jisamen shaharon main rahane vaale logon ke liye sansadhano, buniyadi dhaanche or awaas kaa abhaav bhi shaamil he
 High house prices have created a rift between the common man and the dream of a house
 yah kahani noida se lakhanu, banaras, jaipur, indore or bhopal tak ek he
 Statistics show that the housing sector has grown by 32 per cent in the last decade to meet the growing demand from consumers
 iske baavjood aam logon ke liye kifayati daron par makaanon kii kami bani hui he
 People are forced to live in worse conditions in rented houses
 vaise ab noida, jaipur or ranchi jaise shaharon main kifayati makaan ban rahe hai or kifayati daam par pesh kiye ja rahe hai
 Now package deals are also being offered where developers are offering retail services and multiplexes, gaming zones etc
 at a cheaper price
 dilli or mumbai jaise bade shahar apni paripakvata ke str par pahunch chuke hai or ab jagah kii tangi ke daur se guzar rahe hai
 Therefore, high growth rates are being seen in cities and areas close to them where better options are emerging for the common people to live
 tata houseing (shubh grih) or vailu and bajet houseing korporation (vibiechasi) ne pehle darje ke shaharon main kam aay vaale logon ke liye kifayati project shuru kar diya he
 The best example of this is the 23-km road project between Noida and Greater Noida, where people from all walks of life and income are buying residential and commercial buildings
 yah ilaaka har develper kaa lakshya he or un logon kaa bhi jo kiraaye ke makaanon main rah rahe hai
 Similar trends of affordable housing are also seen in other cities for people of low income and middle income groups
 kifayati ghar bhale hi aam logon ke liye aakarshak hon lekin nijee developaron ke liye kifayat kaa sauda ab bhi nahin he
 Government policies, rising cost of construction and financing constraints are also discouraging these builders from investing in the affordable segment
 aise main nijee companiyaan maukey talash rahi hai or is segment par jor de rahi hai
 In this way companies like DBS Affordable Homes in Ahmedabad, SNG Group of Jaipur, Johnson Modi Capital Limited in Patna have entered this field
 in shaharon main kaaphi sambhaavnaaen hai kyonki adhiktar audyogic vikaas inamen or inke ird-gird ho rahaa he, jisase kaaphi log inamen bas rahe hai
 Today, affordable homes have emerged as the biggest challenge in urban India
 is shahari paheli ko hal karne kii kunjee yah he ki prashasnic dhaanche ko upyukt banaaya jaae or uskaa asardaar karyanvayan ho
 Private companies working in this industry should get adequate concessions so that they can work according to the rules
 ek baar yah sunishchit ho gaya to yah aam logon, inwestors or sarkaron sabhi ke hit main hoga
 Due to Bollywood's 1975 superhit film 'sholay', the robber Gabbar knows the name of the country
 film to yah kahati he kigabbar singhek kaalpanik charitra he, lekin sach to yah he ki madhya pradesh ke chambal ilaake main asal main gabbar singh naamak ek daaku tha, jiskaa 1950 ke dashak main kaphiatankatha

 Later he was encouraged and he took offense to teach his enemies a lesson
 usne kai police karmiyon ke naak kaat liye
 Gabbar Singh was born in Bhind district of Madhya Pradesh in 1926
 uski kadalathi badhiya thi or gaanv ke akhaade main uski kaaphi izzat thi
 In 1955, at the age of 29, Gabbar Singh left his village and joined the gang of Kalyan Singh Gurjar, the notorious dacoit of Chambal
 haalanki, jaldi hi vah is gang se baahar nikal gaya or usne apana alag gang bana liya
 Due to the vandalism committed in his robberies, Gabbar Singh soon became synonymous with terror in many areas of UP, MP and Rajasthan
 sarkaar ne uske sir par 50,000 rupee kaa inaam rakh diya
 It is said that even his Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru expressed concern over his terror
 iske baad aakhirkaar 1959 main madhya pradesh sarkaar ne ek yuva police adhikari rajendra prasadmodike netritv main ek special task force banaaya
 Modi started Abhiyanamodi started gathering intelligence about Gabbar Singh
 modi ne police kii ek team banaakar gabbar singh or uske dal ko chambal ke ilaake main gher liya
 In November 1959, firing started between the police and the Gabbar Singh gang
 is encounter ko paas kii sadak se guzar rahe bahut se yatriyon ne dekha or log dur se bas or train kii chat par khadey hokar ise dekh rahe the
 Gabbar Singh was injured, but managed to escape
 haalanki baad main uskaa gang kamjor ho gaya or khatm ho gaya
 After this, Gabbar Singh was killed in another encounter

 rustamaji ne gabbar kii maut kii soochna nehru ko di
 It is worth noting that Kisholke's co-scriptwriter Salim Khan's father was in Madhya Pradesh police, so he may have heard about Gabbar Singh

 yandex search ke jariye jab hamane reverse search kiya, to hamen ek blog mila, jo 6 april 2013 ko likhaa gaya tha
 In which similar pictures were seen
 jab is indonesian blog kaa anuwaad kiya gaya, to hamen srilankai sarkaar ke khilaaf musalamaanon ke is virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree mili, jo april 2013 main hua tha
 We also got a report from Colombo Telegraph about this, where the news was published, according to which on 5 April 2013, Muslims gathered outside the Sri Lankan High Commission in London and demonstrated against the excesses of the Sri Lankan government
 hamen is pradarshan kaa ek bada video bhi mila, jo may 2013 main utyub par daalaa gaya tha, jiske shuru ke do minute hu-ba-hu hai
 On this basis, it can be said that this claim is completely false and this protest is 6 years old and has nothing to do with the Sri Lankan blast

 However, it is time to take a decision
