 The amazing thing is that India lost to England (in World Hockey League semi-finals, Antwerp) 1–5 in the last match between the two teams and finished fourth in the tournament
 england ke coach bob krachali ne match se pehle kaha bhi tha, "unhone (bharat ne) germany ke khilaaf acha khel dikhaaya
 Although this team could not play well against Holland and Argentina, but this team will definitely do well in the quarter-finals and play a tough match
 "tippaniyan The Indian team did this
 bharat ne great britain ke khilaaf kai haar kaa badla le liya, wo bhi ek aham toornament main or bade hi style se
 Goals from VR Raghunath (19th minute) and Talwinder Singh (39th minute) gave India a big win
 great britain kii ore se iklauta gol simon mantel ne 52wein minute main kiya
 This gap of the balls remained till the end
 ek khaas baat ye bhi he ki is match ke pehle teen quarter main bhartiya khilaadiyon ne total hockey khelkar sabko prabhavit kiya
 These players missed some opportunities
 ek phikr kii baat aakhri lamhon main khud par dabaav banane kii dikhi jisapar kaam karne kii jarurat he, lekin agar coach rolant aultmans kii team aisa hi khelti rahi to bhartiya hockey kii baar-baar tuutati saanson ko dam mil saktaa he

 One special thing is that in the first three quarters of this match, Indian players impressed everyone by playing Total Hockey
 in khilaadiyon ne kuch maukey zarur ganvaaye
 One worry seems to be putting pressure on himself in the last moments that needs to be worked on, but if coach Rolant Oltmans' team continues to play like this, then the recurring breath of Indian hockey can get strength
 dilli ke hindu raav aspataal main 29 june ko apatkaal ward ke doctoron ke saath marpet kaa maamla saamne aayaa to gussaye doctor hadtaal par chale gaye
 The OPD of the hospital remained closed for the entire day on 1 July

 abhi haal hi main pashchim bengal main ek doctor ke saath marpet kaa maamla to itnaa garmaya ki rajya or centre donon sarkaron ko dakhal dena padaa
 The Chief Minister of the state, Mamata Banerjee, was forced to meet doctors and give assurances
 doctoron ke saath marpet ke maamle rojaanaa kii baat ho gaye hai
 After all, why do the doctors who come together to treat the patient get so angry? Why are doctors constantly falling prey to violence? Neurosurgeon doctor Sanjeev Kumar says, "actually there is a" lack of better communication "at the root of these conflicts
 vyakti doctor ke paas tabhi aata he jab uski haalat kharaab hoti he
 Relatives are nervous
 udhar doctor kisi duusare marij ke ilaaj kii vajah se fouran us duusare marij ko dekh nahin paata he to vivaad bad jaataa he to phir
 
 
 "they say," The doctor knows which patient must give time first
 sirf vah apni praathamikta ke aadhaar par ilaaj karata he
 But the relatives of the patient do not understand this
 bas doctors ko marij ke uttejit sambandhiyon ko yahi baat samjaani he
 The work is difficult, but it can be done with little care
 ''doctoron kii suraksha, unki samasyaayein or sambhavit samaadhaan par ginacologist doctor mamata thakur kahati hai, "darasal hinsa aajkar hawa main he
 Somewhere the journalists are beaten, then the lawyer is somewhere
 sadak par niklo to jhagade hi jhagade
 But it has to be understood that a doctor is also a human being
 doctor ke khilaaf hinsa ke maamle badhane kaa asar yah hua ki ab sarkari doctor marij kaa ilaaj karne kii jagah use duusare aspataal main refer karne main bhalaai samajhate hai, jabaki uskaa ilaaj vah bhi kar sakate hai
 Cause fear
 doctor ab pallaa jhaadne lage hai
 And this practice is not good
 doctoron ko har cheez ke liye jimmedaar tehraana thik nahin
 However, Dr
 Mamta has also appealed that if Prime Minister Narendra Modi raises the issue of increasing cases of violence against doctors, then a good message will reach people

 Take money from both parties, but vote on the broom
 ' unhone logon se apil kii ki ve bijepi or congress kaa paisa lekar, vot AAP ko dekar, donon ko 'ullu' banaaen

 Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken even threatened to go to the Election Commission against Kejriwal
 maakan ne kejariwal se apane bayaan par maafee maangane ko kaha

 kashmir main abhi tak pravaasiyon ko koi adhikaar nahin tha or nivesh ko protsaahan nahin miltaa tha
 But now that the Modi government has abolished the two sections of Article 370, Kashmir can really become a paradise for the youth there
 sabase pehla phayda to vahaan udyogon kii sthapana, naukariya kaa srijan, logon ko bijli-gas kii behatar uplabdhta kaa ho saktaa he
 This will speed up the economic development of the state
 kashmiriyon ko ab jaldi hi kareeb 3 trillian dollar kii bhartiya iconomi se ekikrut hone kaa phayda milegaa
 Many experts say that Jammu and Kashmir had more losses than 370
 ab bharat ke sabhi kanoon kashmir main lagu ho jaaenge
 Earlier it used to take years to restore any facility in Kashmir, because the state government's own laws were applied for it
 jiesti main rajya baad main shaamil hua, gas pipeline ko manjuur karne main rajya sarkaar ne do saal laga die, lekin ab rajya main baaki desh ke saath hi koi suvidha aa sakati he
 Now you can buy land in Kashmir
 iskaa sabase bada phayda audyogic gatividhiyon ke liye hoga
 Apart from Jammu, Udhampur and Kathua areas currently have industrial estates of glass, plastic and building materials
 ek niveshak ne bataaya, 'pehle aise estate banane ke liye aapako jameen yaa to lij par leni hoti thi, yaa kisi sthaneey naagarik ke saath gathjod karnaa hota tha
 Both of these used to increase the cost of business considerably
 'bade corporate gharaane abhi tak rajya main nivesh se bachate rahe
 One industrialist said that it was impossible to send skilled workers from outside in the state
 unhone kaha, 'kaarkaane sthapit karne ke liye jameen nahin milti thi
 If you go to the industrial estates of Udhampur and Kathua, then the problem is that the workers are not ready to go there
 asal main kaamgaar vahaan makaan banane ke liye jameen nahin kharid sakate the or bacchon ko vahaan ke skulon main admician nahin miltaa
 'the population of the state is only 1 crore, so there will be a need to take workers from outside to establish industries there
 ab vahaan log janaa bhi pasand karenge kyonki ab koi bhi vahaan jameen kharid sakegaa or apane bacchon ko skulon main padhaa sakegaa
 Jobs will be created Unemployment has been a problem among the youth of Tejashmir, due to which they are involved in anti-india activities like stone pelting
 lekin ab rajya main bade paimaane par naukariyon kaa srijan ho saktaa he
 Wipro has started preparations to set up IT and R&D centers in Srinagar
 pharma sector kii kai desi-videshi companiyaan bhi jammu-kashmir main project lagane kii icchhuk hai
 Many houses in Jammu and Kashmir have promoted corruption, nepotism and communalism
 kaarobaar ke liye banegaa mufeed maahaulakaarobaar ke liye maahaul behatar hone kii ummid kii ja rahi he, kyonki kashmir main kuch jame-jamaaye saamanti pariwaron kaa dabadabaa kam hoga or bhrashtachar main bhi kami aegi
 In addition, strictly sponsored by the central government, Pakistan-sponsored terrorism will be reduced, separatists will be marginalized, Indian security forces will be strengthened
 in sabaki vajah se shanti kaa maahaul banegaa to kaarobaar ke liye bhi mufeed maahaul banegaa

 The Supreme Court has reduced the sentence of Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt by one year in 93 blasts, though Sanju Baba will still have to spend three and a half years in jail

 Kapil Sibal: The Supreme Court is the largest court in the country and everyone should respect its decision

 This is unfortunate for Sanjay Dutt

 The highway connecting the two important cities of Maharashtra, Pune and Satara, is always crowded
 desh ke mashhoor hill stesan khandala ke kareeb hone kii vajah se yahaan touriston kaa aana-janaa bhi laga rahata he
 But at about four o'clock on April 30, 2013, in a deserted and littered warehouse adjacent to the road at this high speed, what a person saw, he made a hue and cry
 is godaam main ek nahin, balki do-do laashen padi hai or wo bhi buree tarah jali hui
 Who could be the dead bodies lying in this secluded place away from any residential area? The man immediately calls the police immediately and the next moment the police starts investigating the case
 laashon ko baraamad kar postmortem ke liye bhijwa diya jaataa he or unke shinaakht kii koshish shuru ho jaati he
 The identity of those who died seeing these dead bodies is 90% impossible, but by looking at the deal and clothing, the corpses at first sight seem to be that of an elderly couple
 par kiski? police aasapaas ke duusare thanon main bhi isaki khabar de detii he
 So that maybe a clue can be found
 or phir jaldi hi khandala police ko ek ahm suraag mil hi jaataa he
 He learns that a missing man and a woman are reported missing at Koregaon Park police station in Pune
 ab khandala police fouran pune ke koregaanv thane main baat karti he or laashon kii shinaakht ke liye us parivaar ko bulaayaa jaataa he, jinhone apane ghar ke bujurg ke gaayab hone kii report likhavai he
 And then the suspicion of the police soon turns into confidence
 laashen unheen bujurgon kii hai, jo pune se laapata hue hai
 The deceased are identified as Vinod Broker, an 84-year-old billionaire businessman from Pune and Usha, 54, his secretary
 chaanbin ke dauraan ye baat saafe hoti he ki brokar apni secretary ke saath 29 april kii subah se hi lapaata the
 Where did both go? How did both reach this high-way? Who murdered them? And what was the motive for the murder? All these questions were still just questions
 lihaaza police ab aage kii jaanch main jute gai
 The 40 crore Banglidhar bungalow on Juhu Beach in Mumbai was traded and the owner of the bungalow was killed there
 84 saal ke arbapati real state kaarobaari ke katl kii ye vaardaat jitani sansanikhej he, iske peeche kii sajeesh utani hi chaunkaanewaali?aakhir kya he 40 karod ke bangale kaa raaj or koun he qaatil?pune-satara hai-ve par hue dabl murder ke maamle main police ko ab ek mukaam mil chukaa tha
 At least two of the secrets related to these badly burnt bodies had already been revealed
 police ye jaan chuki thi ki maranevaale koun hai, kahaan ke rahanevaale hai
 But the most important question still remains, who did the murder and why? Both of them, the police, from the families of both Maktool i
e
 84-year-old billionaire real-state businessman Vinod Broker and his 54-year-old secretary Usha Nair
 Started inquiry
 chunki katl kaa dayera pune se lekar satara hai-ve or khandala tak failaa hua tha, lihaaja is maamle kii jaanch main koregaanv police or mumbai krime branch ke alaava police kii or bhi kai tiimon ko laga diya gaya
 As the investigation progressed, it was found that Vinod Broker, the owner of crores, was engaged in bargaining for one of his properties these days
 ye property kahin or nahin, balki mumbai ke sabase posh ilaakon main se ek yani juhu bich ke kareeb ek prime lokation par thi
 This was a bungalow in the immediate neighborhood of all the celebrities, including the century great Amitabh Bachchan, which could be a dream for anyone
 lekin vinod takreeban 8 acre main faile apane isi bangale ko bechnaa chaahate the or unhone isaki keemat rakhi thi, puure 40 karod rupee
 Now Vinod got an influx of property dealers after hearing that such hot property was for sale
 lekin sawaal ye tha ki kya qaatil inhen property dilers main se koi ek tha? or kya vinod kii hatya is property kii vajah se hi kii gai? agar haa, to sawaal ye bhi tha ki phir qaatilon ne unki secretary ushaa nair ko apana shikaar kyon banaaya?philhal police ke paas in sawaalon ke sahi-sahi jawaab to nahin the, lekin itnaa zarur shaq ho chalaa tha ki is dabl murder ke peeche property kaa angel ek badi vajah ho sakati he
 Now on the one hand, the police started to look into the call details of the broker and his secretary, on the other hand, in the last days Vinod started preparing a list of people who met the broker and his secretary
 or isi kadi main police ko ek aisi baat pataa chali ki uske kaan khadey ho gaye
 Now this story of double murder was almost cleared
 kam se kam police ko itnaa to pataa chal hi gaya tha ki katl ke peeche 40 karod kaa bangala hi sabase badi vajah he
 But when the hands of the police reached the murderer and when the culprits told the police the whole story of the murder, the uniformed men also stopped for a while
 amir kaarobaari vinod brokar pichley 15 dinon se bandra ke ek property dealer ibrahim shaikh ke sampark main the
 The same Ibrahim Sheikh, who in a few years had made crores of rupees from the business of property in Mumbai and adjoining areas, and this time he himself spoke to an elderly broker and hoped to buy his Juhu bungalow
 chaanbin aage badi to ye baat bhi saaf ho gai ki gaayab hone se pehle aakhri baar vinod brokar or unki secretary ushaa nair, ibrahim shaikh ke saath hi dekhe gaye the
 In such a situation, the suspicion of the police deepened on Sheikh
 lihaaja, usne bina der kiye bandra ke property dealer shaikh ko uthaane kaa faisla kiya
 Sheikh was now in police custody and after almost five hours of questioning, the story of this sensational double murder was cleared
 shaikh ne police ko bataaya ki juhu ke bangale kii kharid ke liye jab usne pehali baar bujurg kaarobaari brokar se baat kii thi, tabhi uske man main bangale ko kharidne ke badale us par kabja karne kaa khyaal aa chukaa tha
 He then spoke to his partner Ravindra Reddy and then decided to remove the broker from the road
 iske baad donon koregaanv park main brokar ke ghar pahunche or unhen 4 karod rupee advance ke taur par die
 Both of them returned that day, but it was the day they both decided to kill the broker
 takreeban pandrah din baad yani 29 april ko donon deal final karne ke bahaane ek baar phir koregaanv main unke ghar pahunche or unhen satara main apni ek property par invest karne kaa sabjbag dikhaakar apane saath chalane ke liye raji kar liya
 Usha Nair, secretary of the broker, was also in bad luck
 wo bhi apane maalik ke saath nai property dekhne ke liye satara chal padi
 But what happened on the way was shocking
 pune-satara haive par ek sunsaan jagah par donon ne apane driver nitin bhaatia ke saath milakar vinod brokar or unki secretary usha nair kii galaa ghontkar hatya kar di or phir pahchaan chhipaane ke iraade se unhen aag ke hawaale kar diya
 After this, both returned once again to Pune and reached Mumbai with the rest of the documents related to Juhu's bungalow
 yahaan unhone adaalat main vinod brokar ke hulie se mail khate ek bujurg ko brokar bataa kar juhu ke bangale ko apane naam par karwaane kii kavayad shuru kar di
 But despite all the precaution of Sheikh, the police got a glimpse of his black handiwork and the police first caught Sheikh and then his partner Ravindra Reddy
 chaanbin ke dauraan saaf hua ki unka driver nitin bhaatia bhi unke saath is saazish main shaamil tha
 Moreover, after the murder of an elderly broker and his secretary, Bhatia stole the broker's car and sold it to someone else
 lekin do-do katl ke baad raaton-raat juhu main ek aaleeshaan bangale kaa maalik banane kaa khwab dekhanevaale shaikh or reddy aakhirkaar salaakhon ke peeche pahunch gaye
 The Central Road Research Institute found in the Bhikhaji Kamaplessteady that CCTV feeds and surveys on traffic signals are being used to reduce the countdown of the signal
 survey main biker or auto driver se poocha ja rahaa he ki unhen kin-kin chauraahon par zyada gaadi rokani padati he
 The study showed that before the campaign about 20 percent people used to turn off the engine, which has now increased to 52 percent
 yahi vajah he ki Petroleum Conservation & Research Association (PCRA) aurcentral road research institutane milakar bhikaaji kama place kii is study ko 100 intersections par dohraane kii thaanee he
 Last year, the Central Road Research Institute in a study of Bhikaji Cama Place intersection found that if you turn off the engine at less than 20 seconds of red light, fuel is not saved
 agar 20 second se zyada kii lite hone par ingine chaalu rakhane par ful kii khapat zyada hoti he
 If there is more than 20 seconds of red light, then shut down the engine, which will not release hazardous gases like CO2, NOX, CO and fuel consumption will also be reduced
 ise hi switch of behwear kaha gaya
 In last year's study, it was found that the use of fuel at a crossroads in Delhi saved fuel costs of about 250 crores

 ' Link on Facebook pagea photo posted by Twinkle Khanna (@twinklerkhanna) ondec 10, 2016 at 8:06pm PST Senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh has reacted sharply to the statements made by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders regarding the caste and religion of Ramabhakta Hanuman
 unhone kaha he ki hindu devtaa par aapattijanak tippanee karne vaale uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or bijepi ke anya netaaon ke saath rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or akhaada parishad jaise sanghathanon ko koi bhi sambandh nahin rakhana chahie or in netaaon kaa saarvajanik taur par tiraskaar kiya janaa chahie
 Congress MP and senior leader in the Rajya Sabha Digvijay Singh said that the unrestrained debate over Hanumanji was started by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath calling Bajrang Bali a Dalit
 iske baad bijepi ke anya netaaon ne bajrang bali ko musalmaan or jat bhi bataa diya
 He said that we consider Hanumanji to be an avatar of Lord Shankar
 lekin bijepi ke netaa hanumanji ko bhi jati-dharm ke maamle main ghaseet rahe hai
 After all, which religion are these leaders following? Digvijay Singh demanded that Yogi Adityanath and other BJP leaders should apologize for their objectionable statements on Lord Hanuman
 iske saath hi, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh, vishwa hindu parishad or akhaada parishad jaise sanghathanon ko in netaaon kaa saarvajanik rup se bahishkaar va tiraskaar karnaa chahie
 Significantly, during the recently concluded assembly elections in Rajasthan's Alwar district, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath called Hanuman a Dalit, Vanvasi
 jiske baad bijepi ke tamaam netaaon ne bhagwaan hanuman kaa alag alag taur par varnan kiya
 At the same time, Union Minister Satyapal Singh had said that Hanuman ji was Arya, there was no other caste at that time, hence Hanuman ji was the great man of Arya caste
 vahiin, upi sarkaar main mantri lakshminarayan choudhary ne hanuman ko jat bataa diya
 So at the same time bjp's MLC Bukkal Nabav said that Hanuman was a Muslim
 bihar main jediu or bijepi sarkaar main sabakuch thik-thaak nahin he
 After coming to NDA, the distance between JDU and Bihar government to observe Yoga Day remains intact

 On the occasion of Ramnavami, Rs 5 lakh was given to the Patna DM by the Ministry of Tourism to spend in the promotion of the program, but that expenditure was not incurred
 duusari taraf uske kuch dinon baad patna me yojit 'deen bachaao desh bachaao' raily main grih vibhaag ke dwaara die 40 lakh rupee ko patna dm ne kharch kiya
 When the tourism minister of bjp's quota asked the DM about not spending money, the dm's reply was, 'we were in a hurry
 'bihar sarkaar ke paryatak vibhaag ne patna main 24- 25 march ko hue ramanavami utsav ke dauraan ramayana circuit ke prachaar-prasar ke liye 5 lakh rupee dm patna ko die
 But Patna DM Kumar Ravi did not spend a quarter of that
 bijepi cote ke paryaton mantri pramod kumaar ne kaha, 'jo samiti thi unhone chanda lekar is kaam ko kiya or us raashi ko lautaa diya
 Even when we asked the DM, he said that we were in a hurry
 'mantri bhale hi is par khulkar naa bole lekin uske ek pakhwaade baad patna ke gandhi maidan main 15 april ko 'deen bachaao desh bachaao' raily muslim sanghathan imaarte-e-saria ke dwaara yojit kiya gaya
 The main purpose of organizing that rally was to oppose the central government's attitude on triple talaq and to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 bihar sarkaar ke grih vibhaag ne is aayojan ke liye patna dm ko 40 lakh rupee die
 So that the people attending the rally do not have any problem whether it is a matter of safety or public facilities
 bijepi ke kai mantri is baat ko lekar khafa hai ki ek taraf muslim sanghathan ke kaarykram ke liye sarkaar paisa kharch kar rahi he, duusari taraf ramanavami jaise samaaroh main kharch karne se parhez kar rahi he
 While Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi also attended that ceremony of Ram Navami
 bijepi cote ke bihar sarkaar me krishi mantri prem kumaar kaa kahana he, 'paise agar sarkaar ke str par ramanavami ke liye die gaye the, to unhen kharch karnaa chahie tha
 Ram Navami is the great festival of us
 hindu dharm ke log ramanavami manaate hai
 In the city and village, and the government decided that those who were participating in Ramnavami to improve the programs of Ramnavami
 unki suvidha ko lekar ke sarkaar ne raashi aavantit kii thi to jila padaadhikari ko kharch karnaa chahie tha
 We will find out where the money was spent
 'patna ke dm kumaar ravi ne kaha, 'paisa march ke ant main aayaa tha
 So we returned the tourism department money using the amount of the second item
 haalanki dm ne camere par kuch kaha ki par janata dal you ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki sarkaar kaa koi dharm nahin hota he
 There is no scope for politics in this
 sarkaar main shaamil dal ko jarur sambandhit paksh ke bare main jaan lenaa chahie
 He said that it is not the case that the Patna district administration did not spend money but completed the plan by spending money for another item
 unhone kaha ki ye baat sach he ki ramanavami ke liye paryaton vibhaag ne jo paisa abantit kiya wo march ke ant main kiya tha
 Therefore that money could not be used
 lekin duusari taraf deen bachaao or desh bachaao raily vittiya varsh ke shuruyaat main hui
 So there was no problem in spending money
 lekin bijepi netaaon ke man main ye sawaal jarur he ki aakhir kiske ishaare par paise ko kharchakarne se rokaagaya

 However, they also say that keeping their body out for so many hours can spoil it and in such a situation it will be difficult to keep it back in the hospital after keeping the body out for 72 hours, because that body will be of no use to them

 ' It is becoming increasingly troublesome for the Aam Aadmi Party to expose his former Punjab Convincer Sucha Singh Chhotepur from the party on charges of taking bribe
 kuch maheene pehle succha singh chhotepur ko party ne rishwat lene ke aarope main baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya tha
 The party had said that Sucha Singh Chhotepur took a bribe of about two lakh rupees by promising to get tickets from a volunteer
 jiskaa video banaakar sting kiya gaya
 After which the party probing Sucha Singh Chhotepur had shown the way out of the party
 kejariwal or sanjay singh ne rachi sting kii sajishasuccha singh chhotepur kaa bahucharchit sting oparation karne vaale gurulabh singh mahal ne chandigarh ke ek press club main press conference karke ye saaf kiya ki succha singh chhotepur ek eemaandaar aadmi hai
 He said that the conspiracy to remove Kisucha Singh Chhotpur was hatched by Arvind Kejriwal and Sanjay Singh
 gurulabh singh ne kaha ki aam aadmi party kii hai kaman arvind kejariwal, durgesh pathak or sanjay singh kii marji ke anusaar maine unka sting oparation kiya
 He also narrated to the media an audio clipping, in which Sucha Singh was asking Chhotepur to take the money and Chhotepur was refusing
 mahal ne bataaya ki succha singh chhotepur ke badhate hue raajnneetik kad se darkar or aane vaale chunaavon main tikaton ke bantwaare ko aam aadmi party ke dilli main baithe hue logon ke hisaab se karne ke liye succha singh chhotepur ko darkinar karnaa bahut jaruri tha
 That is why the Aam Aadmi Party entrusted me with the responsibility of giving Rs 2 lakh to Sucha Singh Chhotepur without any receipt
 succha singh chhotepur in paison ko nahin le rahaa tha lekin main jabardastee use dekar aayaa
 He said that my motive behind this was that i wanted to be loyal to him to know the reality of Aam Aadmi Party and Kejriwal
 saath hi dimag main yah bhi tha ki shaayad aam aadmi party main mujhe koi bada pad mil jaae
 Now i have enough evidence and i can prove the veracity of my point
 isliye main itani der baad media ke saamne aayaa hum
 i will continue to disclose about the Aam Aadmi Party with further evidence
 succha singh ne banaai nai partivahin gurulabh singh ke is khulaase ke baadasuccha singh chhotepurjo ek vakt main aam aadmi party ke punjab kanvinar hua karte the, lekin party se nikaale jane ke baad unhone apni alag raajnneetik party 'apana punjab party' bana lee he
 He once again came in front of the media and said that even after being expelled from the party, he kept saying that he was a man of honest image
 isse pehle bhi kai baar wo party ke liye isi tarah se fund logon se lete rahe the or party kii reliyon or baithkon main is paise ko kharch bhi kiya gaya
 Sucha Singh Chhotepur said that the party never denied before taking this fund, but when the party felt that the popularity of a Punjabi face of Punjab was increasing in the party, then it was thoughtful planning to get a bribe by getting a fake sting Accusing him, he was shown the way out of the party
 jabaki wo ek eemaandaar chhavi ke aadmi hai jisko puraa punjab jaanata he
 Arvind Kejriwal has once been a party volunteer and questioned Gurulabh Singh, who stung Sucha Singh Chhotepur, on the allegation of Sucha Singh Chhotepur being shown a way out of the party by accusing him of taking bribe by doing a fake sting
 unhone kaha ki itane din se gurulabh singh kahaan gaayab tha or ab wo is tarah ke aarope chunaav se thik pehle kyon laga rahaa he
 It is enough to tell in itself that this charge is a conspiracy against the Aam Aadmi Party
 aam aadmi party kii lokapriyata ko dekhakar vipakshi partiyaan is tarah ke hatkande apana rahi hai
 Even if the Aam Aadmi Party defies the revelations of Gurulabh Singh as an allegation
 lekin aam aadmi party ke paas is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin he ki jab isi gurlali singh ke sting ko aadhaar banaakar hi aam aadmi party ne apane punjab ke kanvinar succha singh chhotepur ko rishwat lene ke aarope main party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya tha to ab party usee gurulabh singh ko bhi katghare main kaise khadaa kar rahi he

 On the ongoing confrontation between the BJP and Shiv Sena, an article has been published in Saamana titled 'delhi Tumha, Maharashtra Hamara'
 isamen shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke hawaale se bijepi ke liye kaha gaya he ki loksabhaa main tumhaare mishan 272 ke liye tan−man−dhan se kaam kiya
 Now we also have 150 missions in the assembly
 dilli tum sambhaalo, lekin maharashtra main satta hamaari ho
 This article further states that for the last 25 years, there is an alliance not for the chair but for Hindutva
 is gathbandhan dharm ko yaad karo
 When campaigning should begin, then we are trying to pull seats, do not do such deeds
 in dinon desh ke pradhanmantri ke sarkari awaas 7 res course main kaaphi halchal he
 This movement is neither about the ongoing general election nor its imminent outcome
 yahaan alag tarah kii vyastata he
 a PMO official said that we are busy packing as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is left with eight days left to step down
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne is varsh ke shuru main hi kah diya tha ki yadi is baar bhi sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) ko sarkaar banane kaa hi mauka miltaa he, tab bhi ve agali sarkaar kaa netritv nahin karenge or kisi nae vyakti ko bagdor saunpna chahenge
 Books, gifts and other items are being carefully sorted, cataloged and packaged
 piemo ke ek adhikari ne apana naam jaahir nahin hone dene kii shart par bataaya ki pradhanmantri chaahate hai ki jab ve pad choden to unke uttaradhikari ko sabhi chijen suvyavasthit mili
 Family members at 7 Race Courses, which have been the Prime Minister's residence for a decade, are busy packing the goods so that they can be taken to the 3 Motilal Nehru Marg, the accommodation they are getting after retirement

 The list of goods will be available on the website of the Ministry of External Affairs
 rahul kii kisaan yatra dekh lee
 Seeing the victory chariot of Akhilesh too
 amit shah kii parivartan reliyaan sabake saamne hai
 The days are also coming in from the rally and press conference of Behenji
 lekin yah sab dekhakar bhi yah nahin sujhata ki uttar pradesh vidhaan sabha chunaav ja kis taraf rahaa he
 Neither the figures of the previous elections are suggesting anything, nor do they overstep the statements of big leaders
 koi sira haath main na aane ke baavjood chunaav se pehle kai-kai baar chunaav kaa parinaam jaan lene kii besabri sab main he
 So how to solve curiosity? In 2007, the atmosphere against SP, in this way, leave the traditional election analysis and do something new
 jaise yaad kariye ki 2007 ke uttar pradeshvidhansabha chunaavse pehle yah baat saaf ho gai thi, ki log ab mulaayam singh ko waapas dekhnaa nahin chaahate hai
 The BJP was split
 mayawati kii puraani saakh or tevar logon ke jehan main the
 There was also a new equation of dalit-brahmin
 chunaav aate-aate log kehane lage ki bahan ji aaengi
 And she really came
 2012 main hallaa ho gaya bahanji gayi2012 kaa chunaav aate-aate, yah baat joro par aa gai ki bahanji kaa ripet hona mushkil he
 Land acquisition, scandals and high profile killings shook people
 yuvikhileshke naam kii charchaa chal padi
 He appeared as the only option and sat on the chair
 2014 main modi, modi, modi2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav aayaa to kisi or naam yaa kaam kii charchaa nahin hui
 Modi was the only one in the election
 haal yah tha ki sawaal poochne vaala or jawaab dene vaala, samvaad shuru hone se pehle hi jaanate ki ve modi ke naam par charchaa karne vaale hai
 All this was happening in such a high tone that in UP, BJP made a clean sweep in the name of Modi
 bijepi ke saath obisilekin is baar charchaa main kiskaa kaa naam he
 Till now, it was not heard on the road that Akhilesh was going
 bijepiki charchaa he, lekin vahaan se kisi kaa naam nahin he, jaisaa ki 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main tha
 The BJP is not weak at all, but it is not even visible in the shadow of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ab tak vahaan pahunchi he, jahaan brahaman, baniyaa ke alaava gaiyr yadav obisi jatiyaan uske saath khadi dikh rahi hai
 But in this picture too there is a difference between the city and the village
 gaanv se bijepi kaa samvaad kund hua he
 But the backward castes like maurya-kushwaha and Pal are getting closer to BJP than at any time before
 bijepi kaa sameekaran santulit he
 The bsp's dalit-brahmin card is being flopped to say the old dalit-brahmin formula of the flop-bahujan Samaj Party, but there is no buyer for it
 bispi musalamaanon ko apane saath laane ke liye puri takat se lagi he, lekin ve kitne bhi chhuten, sapa se badi sankhya main alag nahin ho sakate
 The BSP has a core Dalit vote, but the Maurya and Pal communities have also been its founding voter, which is far from it today
 brahman usase sadh nahin rahaa he
 Mayawati has improved since 2012 and 2014, but is still far from power
 akhilesh ke alaava kiskaa naob waapas lautate hai sapa par
 So sp's biggest strength is that not only is Akhilesh's name discussed as Chief Minister, but it is happening for the first time that while in power in the country's largest state, his developmental works are being discussed
 haal main hue paariwarik kalah ne shuru main unki saakh par batta lagaaya
 But this fight was seen on TV for so long that people finally started feeling Akhilesh
 balki kuch had tak sahanubhuti bhi paa gaye
 This sympathy is similar to what Modi got in the 2013 Advani versus Modi fight
 is ladaai main vijay ne modi ko sahanubhuti ke saath hi party par ecchhatra raaj bhi diya tha
 This fight also gave Modi a tempo to move among the public
 atyaadhunik prachaar ke yug main agar modi in halaat ko apane paksh main mode sakate hai to akhilesh aisa kyon nahin kar sakate? party main do maheene chale ghamaasan ke baad akhilesh kuch aisi mudra main saamne hai, jaise badi ladaai fatah karke lautaa rajkumaar or badi ladaai main utarane ja rahaa ho
 Apart from this atmosphere, Akhilesh is also standing in front of the plans to distribute free gifts
 congress se anderstendig kar sakati he kamalladai vahaan pahunchi dikh rahi he jahaan akhilesh ke paas naam or maahaul he, to bijepi ke paas jaateey sameekaran hai
 If the BSP has anything, it has the ability to surprise everyone
 aise main kuch ghatakar or kuch batchqar teenon partiyaan barabari par hai
 Yes, the Samajwadi Party definitely has an edge in Akhilesh's name
 or kahin unhone ajit singh se gathbandhan kar liya or kuch 50 se 70 siton par congress ke saath gathbandhan ke bajaay pashchim bengal kii tarj vaali under standing kar lee to unke maahaul ko samikarnon kaa bhi sahaara mil jayega
 The Aam Aadmi Party has stepped up the attack on LG, BJP and the central government over the issue of installing CCTV cameras in Delhi
 'aap' kii mahila netaaon ne bijepi or uparajyapal se 4 sawaal puche hai
 At the same time, the party has also responded to the Chief Secretary expressing disrespect for CCTV
 aam aadmi party ne centre sarkaar se poocha he ki agar 15 agast par vips ke liye CCTV camere lage sakate hai to aam janata ke liye kyon nahin?'aap' pravaktaa aatishi marlena ne bataaya ki dilli sarkaar ne dilli main sisitivi lagane kaa yah prastaav 13 oktober 2015 ko shuru kiya tha
 In November 2015, a committee was formed which did all the manipulation regarding installation of CCTV and in June 2016 a tender was passed
 us tender ke tahat keval ek company ne aavedan kiya jiske chalate dobaaraa se tender jari kiya gaya or aakhir main 10 janvari 2017 main do companiyon ko chunaa gaya, jisamen ek centre sarkaar kii BEL company bhi thi or unako CCTV camera lagane kaa kaam diya gaya
 The Aam Aadmi Party alleges that since 3 years the elected government has been trying to install CCTV cameras in Delhi but some high level officials sitting in the Lieutenant Governor and Secretariat have been stuck in different ways
 AAP ne puche alji or bijepi se 4 sawaal
 
 
 1- In September 2017, the CBSE was ordered by the Center that all the CBSE schools should have CCTV cameras
 kya dilli ke skool sibiesai ke adheen nahin aate hai? or agar aate hai to uparajyapal or duusare sarkari vibhaagon ne isamen rukaawatein kyon paidaa kii? CCTV kyon nahin lagane die?2- duniya main ek desh aisa nahin he jisaki rajdhani main residential or market aria main CCTV camera naa lagen hon, to bharat abhi tak isse vanchit kyon he?3- bhaajapa bataae ki chunaav main vah aisi koun si gatividhiyaan karne vaale hai jisaki vajah se wo 2019 loksabhaa chunaav hone tak CCTV camere ke prastaav ko sthagit rakhana chaahate hai?4-dilli sarkaarne desh kaa sabase sasta CCTV camera lagane kaa prastaav sadan main rakhaa he to bhaajapa bataae ki phir bhi wo kyon nahin chaahati ki dilli main CCTV camere lagen? Tik Tok was banned in India for some time, but it seems the company did not make any difference, especially in popularity
 kyonki ab Tik Tok ap aipal ap store ke free katigari ap main top ek baar phir se top par aa gaya he
 That is, the ban has not affected the users too and even now people are downloading like they have done before
 bain ke baad company kuch zyada hi aakraamak hui he or yugers ko hashtag chalaane par 1 lakh rupee tak kaa inaam dene kaa daawa kar rahi he
 Lucky users have been announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh every day
 tik tok kii taraf se kaha gaya he ki is ap ko bharat ke 200 million yugers se kaaphi achche respons, saport or pyaar mila he
 This app is asking people to use the hashtag of returnoftiktok and on doing so, you can get a reward of up to 1 lakh rupees
 gauratlab he ki madras hai court kii madurai bench ne is tiktok ap par bain lagane kaa aadesh jari kiya or google or aipal ko letters likh kar iske downlod karne par pambadi lagaai
 But the ban was later lifted on Tick Talk with some conditions
 bharat main tik tok ne bain hone ke baavjood tab hi elaan kiya tha ki yahaan isaki parent company bite dance 60 arab rupee se bhi zyada nivashe karegi
 Apart from this, the number of employees will also be increased here
 company ke bharat main pehle se hi teen ap hai or jald hi company ek or ap laane kii taiyaari kar rahi he

 However, the police recovered the girl alive in critical condition and admitted her to Sadar Hospital
 peedita ke sansanikhej bayaan se maamla saamne aayaa
 The punishment for talking to a young man in the village and refusing to marry a middle-aged man can be so painful for a minor girl, it is unthinkable
 par gopalganj main ek pita ne apni hi beti ko aise sajaa di, jise dekhakar kisi ke bhi rongte khadey ho jaaen

 In such a situation, after the return of the Modi government, all eyes are now on the budget
 kya sarkaar manaregaa par apana focus badhaati he yaa phir graminon kii aarthik sehat sudhaarney ke liye koi nai yojana lekar aati he, kyonki congress hameshaa manaregaa kii safalataa kaa shrey lene kii koshish main rahati he

 Last year, Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that the Center did not release Rs 2,500 crore to Bengal under MNREGA
 jabaki kuch aise bhi pradesh hai, jahaan manaregaa kii raashi shat-pratishat baante jane kii khabaren ain
 Last year, the total amount of MNREGA was distributed in Madhya Pradesh as claimed by the government
 isse pehle arun jetali ne saal 2017-18 ke bajet main manaregaa kaa bajet badhaakar 48,000 karod rupee kar diya tha

 cricket yaa anya mahashur khelon main match phixing kaa naam yaa khilaadiyon par match phixing ke aarope laganaa koi nai baat nahin he
 But the name Spot Fixing was heard only a few years ago
 aisa kaha jaataa he kii spot phixing karke koi bhi team yaa khilaadi match ke nirnay ko bhi prabhavit nahin karte lekin phir bhi ve buki se paise kama lete hai
 The latest examples are Sreesanth, Ankit Chavan and Ajit Chandilake in IPL, and layers are yet to open in this case
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki badalte samay ke saath-saath phixing bhi badal gai he
 Since the people associated with it only mean earning money, it is not necessary that it will affect the outcome of the match, rather, something is done to make the snake die and the sticks are not broken
 yaheen se spot phixing kii shuruyaat hoti he
 Suppose a team is batting well playing first, and has scored 194 runs in 19 overs
 ab jaahir si baat he kii har koi ummid karegaa kii ye team 20 over main 200 ran kaa aankada aaraam se paar kar jaaegi
 Bookies bet here whether the team playing will score 200 or not
 to jaahir si baat he ki adhiktar log satta lagaayenge ki team 200 ran bana legi
 Now if spot-fixing is done here, a message is sent to the cricketers playing in the field that they do not have to score 6 or more runs in the last over and as a result the team batting does not cross the 199-run mark
 is prakaar ek badhiya score bhi bana or isse match kaa nateeja bhi tatkaal prabhavit nahin hua
 Also, in spot-fixing, a player does certain things at a particular time in a match, as the bookie says
 masalan koi gendbaaj apane ek over main jaanboojhkar no ball yaa wid ball phenkata he yaa koi ballebaaj kisi ek over main koi ran nahin banaata he yaa captain maidan main kuch aise faisle letaa he jo pehle se hi ‘fiks’ kiye ja chuke hai
 The relationship between IPL and spot-fixing first came to light in 2012 when the sting operation of a TV channel involved 5 players — T
 pi
 Sudhindra, Mohnish Mishra, Amit Yadav, Shalabh Srivastava and Abhinav Bali had confessed to taking money in exchange for spot-fixing
 iske baad bisisiai ne in sabhi par har prakaar kii cricket se pratibandhit kar diya tha
 The biggest case of spot-fixing came to light in 2010 when three members of the Pakistan team that went on a tour of England - captain Salman Butt, pacer Mohammad Aamir and Mohammad Asif - were accused of being involved in spot-fixing
 ek akhbaar dwaara kiye gaye sting oparation main in teenon ko spot phixing karne main lipt paaya gaya tha or phir inhen jail kii hawa bhi khaani padi
 Match fixing is quite different from this, where players directly influence the decision of the match or a player intentionally underperforms his ability so that the advantage is given to the opposing team
 jab match main behad kaante kii takkar ho rahi ho, tab ek mahatvapurn khilaadi bhi nirnay ko palat saktaa he
 Many times a number of players join together in the morass of fixing which affects the outcome of the match, showing 'synergy'
 purv pakistani captain saleem maalik or tej gendbaaj ata-ur-rahamaan par match phixing ke chalate aaajeevan pratibandh lag chuke hai, or wasim akram par aarthik jurmaana lagane ke saath-saath unhen tab captaini bhi ganvaani padi thi
 Former India captain and Mohammad Azharuddin, Ajay Jadeja and Ajay Sharma have also faced restrictions on fixing charges
 lekin phixing ke kaaran vishwa ko sabase bada dhakka san 2000 main laga tha jab tatkaaleen dakshin africa captain hansee kronye ne buki ke saath rishte hone kii baat maani thi
 Cronje was considered one of the most honest players in the world, and he died in an airplane crash shortly after being banned by the South African board
 kul milakar yah kaha jaae to galat nahin hoga ki sattebaaji ek pyaaj kii tarah he
 The more layers you remove, the more layers will come out and the tears will come along
 bhopal gas traasadee ke maamle main buudhvaar ko saamne aaye kuch sharmasaar karne vaale tathyon ke tahat is baat kaa khulaasa hua he ki union carbide ke purv mukhya kaary adhikari warren anderson ko kis tarah giraftaar ke baad turant jamaanat mil gayi thi
 Meanwhile, the then CBI chief dismissed claims that the agency was asked not to proceed with his extradition case

 Amid allegations made by a senior CBI officer about Anderson's extradition, the then District Magistrate of Bhopal stated his stand as to what he was told to ensure his bail only hours after the arrest of the Carbide officer
 purv jila magistrate moti singh ne bhopal main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘ve (anderson evam anya) bombai se seva udaan se bhopal aaye the
 He was taken into police custody at the airport and taken to Union Carbide's guesthouse
 vahaan unase kaha gaya ki unhen najarband kiya ja rahaa he
 They were kept in three different rooms and thus the arrest proceedings were completed
 ’unhone kaha, ‘uske baad dopaher do baje (saat disambar 1984) mukhya sachiv ne police adheekshak or dm ko unke karyaalay main phone karke anderson ko reeha karne ko kaha
 It was also said that Anderson be sent in an aircraft that was waiting at the airport to fly to Delhi
 ’ singh ne kaha, ‘nirdesh ke anusaar ham us jagah gayi jahaan use rakhaa gaya tha
 We completed the formalities to bail him out
 carbide ke ek adhikari ne uski jamaanat di or use jamaanat par reeha kar diya gaya
 Later, he was taken to the airport and boarded a flight to Delhi
 ’is bich hyderabad main sibiai ke purv nideshak ke vijayrama raav ne agency ke purv sanyukt nideshak bi aar laal ke in daavon ko khaarij kar diya ki america ne sibiai se kaha tha ki anderson ke pratyrpan maamle main aage nahin badha jaye
 Rao told reporters, "the Indian government and the CBI made every effort to extradite Anderson from the US, but the US refused to allow it
" ’sibiai ke purv nideshak ne kaha, ‘america kaa daawa tha ki union carbide ek swaamitv vaali company he tathaa yah aadmi (anderson) jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa kyonki vah factory ke dainandin parichaalan main sidhe taur par shaamil nahin tha
 However, we can hold him morally responsible
 ’ bhopal gas traasadee maamle ke jaanch prabharee sibiai ke purv sanyukt nideshak laal ne mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki videsh mantralay ke adhikariyon ne unase anderson ke pratyrpan maamle main aage nahin badhane ko kaha tha
 Rao said that during that time there was a lot of correspondence between the CBI and the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of External Affairs and the US
 unhone daawa kiya, ‘is prakaar ke patr vyavhaar main videsh mantralay kii taraf se ho saktaa he ki aisa koi patr bheja gaya ho jisamen yah kaha gaya ho ki america anderson ke pratyrpan kii manjuuri nahin de rahaa he
 But i can say that somehow the CBI was not pressurized by the Ministry of External Affairs to finish the case
 ’laal ke daawey ke bare main sawaal puche jane par raav ne kaha, ‘unase (laal se) kaha janaa koi sawaal nahin balki sibiai se kaha janaa ek mudda he
 Rao said, 'he is referring to a letter but that letter should have passed through me
 lekin main nahin jaanata ki vah koun sa patr he
 It has not yet been seen in the media
 ’raav ne kaha ki sibiai or videsh mantralay ke bich vibhinn patron kaa aadan pradaan hua
 'the letter may be in the context that the US government is not keen on extradition
 ek baat spasht he ki america use bharat pratyrpit nahin karnaa chahta tha
 The former CBI director said that the government, CBI and the Ministry of External Affairs never stopped efforts in Anderson's extradition case
 ‘hamane hameshaa prayaas kiya

 This group was formerly headed by Arjun Singh

 On the other hand, the Government of Madhya Pradesh has decided to challenge this decision in the High Court
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne buudhvaar ko samvaadadaataaon se charchaa ke dauraan is maamle main kendra sarkaar or sibiai kii niyat par shankaa jataate hue kaha ki jab ucchtam nyaayalay ne gaiyr iradatan hatya kii dhaaraon ko laaparvaahee ke aaropon main badla tha tab kendra sarkaar or sibiai ne iske liye punarvichaar yachika daayar kyon nahin kii thi
 He said that similarly the efforts of extradition of then Union Carbide chairman Warren Anderson were also on paper and no serious efforts were made
 adaalat ke haal main aaye faisle ko niraashajanak qaraar dete hue unhone kaha ki gas peediton ko nyaay dilaane ke liye sarkaar ne ise ucch nyaayalay main chunauti dene kaa nirnay kiya he or iske sabhi kanoonee pahaluon par adhyayan ke liye ek paanch sadasyeey cameti gathit kii gayi he

 unhone siem ke dharne ko kauwa asana qaraar diya he
 Kiran Bedi has cited a reporter's question in her tweet
 unhone twit main likhaa ki ek mediakarmi ne mujhase sawaal kiya ki kya dharna bhi yoga he? is sawaal par kiran bedi ne apana jawaab bataate hue likhaa, 'haa, bilkul
 It depends if you are sitting on a dharna for some purpose

 Governor Kiran Bedi also shared a photo with this tweet
 is photo main ped kii tahaniyon par do kauwe baithe najar aa rahe hai
 With this, he wrote, 'crow posture'
 haalanki, iske baad unhone ek or twit kiya or rajbhavan parisar main ek billi ke yoga karne kii baat kahi
 This tweet of Kiran Bedi is considered as a funny comment on CM v Narayanasamy's dharna
 duusari taraf narayansami bhi uparajyapal ke khilaaf jamkar bayaanbaji kar rahe hai
 In conversation with Aaj Tak, she said that she is behaving as if she has lost her mental balance
 narayansami ne aarope lagaaya ki yah sirf unke soshal media istemaal kii baat nahin he, balki vah khud ko raashtrapati se bhi upar samajhati hai
 Like the Arvind Kejriwal government of Delhi, the Narayanasamy government is accusing the Lieutenant Governor of not passing files
 uparajyapal kiran bedi dilli kii apni yatra bich main hi chhodkar waapas laut ai or unhone paanch din se jari dharne ko samaapt karne ke liye mukhyamantri ve narayansami ko ravivaar kii shaam ko baatcheet ke liye aamantrit kiya

 In fact, Narayanasamy had warned that the ongoing dharna in front of the Raj Bhavan would be intensified as a 'jail Bharo' movement from February 20, after which Kiran Bedi's proposal for talks came up
 mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki saat farvari ko uparajyapal ko bheje gaye patr main likhi gai hamaari maangon ko jab tak maan nahin liya jaataa he tab tak hamaara dharna jari rahegaa
 Narayanasamy alleges that LG is taking decisions without consulting the CM and the cabinet

 Not only this, the Narayanasamy government also alleges that the Union funds are becoming a hindrance for the Union Territory of Puducherry
 yah baat aath janvari kii he
 Due to fog that day many flights leaving from Delhi were leaving late
 kohre kii vajah se kai fliton ko radd bhi kar diya gaya tha
 i also booked my ticket for Air India flight 073 to Bhubaneswar from Delhi
 flite shaam ko 6
 It was scheduled to leave from Delhi at 30
 shaam ko koharaa bhi kam ho gaya tha
 It seemed that the flight would leave at the right time
 main samay par airport pahunch gaya
 Checked in tab tak flite sahi samay par jane kii ummid thi
 i was told that the flight would leave at the right time
 mere boarding paas main bhi boarding kaa samay chah baje likhaa hua tha
 When i reached the boarding gate, i was told that the flight was on time, but just half an hour earlier it was announced that the flight was now 10 at night
 30 baje jaaegi
 People got angry
 yah sawaal poochne lage ki yah baat sirf aadha ghante pehle kyon bataai ja rahi he? jab maine yah sawaal desk main baithi madam se poocha to unka kahana tha ki aap upar baat kiijie
 Then there was no choice
 chaar ghante kya karnaa? baahar bhi nahin ja sakate
 Luggage boarding was done
 baahar jane ke liye dobaaraa lages waapas mangavaana padataa
 i waited at the airport
 jab kareeb 9
 Arriving at the boarding gate at 45, it was told that the flight coming from Varanasi will go to Bhubaneswar
 varanasi vaali flite 10 baje pahunchane vaali thi, lekin kareeb 10

 Will leave at 15
 logon kaa sabar khatm ho rahaa tha
 People were seen standing near the gate, but there was no one at the desk

 People did not understand what to do, whom to ask? kuch der baad kuch air hostess get ke paas pahunchin
 People clapped, but what? 
 
 yah air hostess to bhopal jane vaali flite ke get se enter karne lagi
 People could not understand that when the cancellation of Bhopal flight has been announced, then why is the air hostess going from the same gate
 phir bhubaneshwar get par khadaa hua air india kaa manager bhopal jaani vaali flite ke get kii taraf chalaa gaya
 11 of the night
 15 baj chuke the, lekin bhubaneshwar flite ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 It was also not being told whether the flight would leave or not
 thodi der baad log yah baat karne lage ki bhubaneshwar jane vaale kru ko bhopal flite ke liye ravaanaa kar diya gaya he
 i was also standing near the gate
 log yah baat kar rahe the ki kisi viipi kii vajah se bhopal flite, jo radd ho chuki thi vah abhi ravaanaa hogi or bhubaneshwar flite ke bare main koi soochna nahin thi
 Then people started getting angry

 When MP Satpathy came to know that the crew of the Bhubaneswar flight was sent to Bhopal, he became angry
 protest karne lage
 Sat in front of the boarding gate
 phir sab kuch ajeeb ho rahaa tha
 Some boarded the Bhopal flight and some stood in line, but were not allowed to leave
 virodh ke chalate surakshakarmi yahaan pahunch gaye
 Started trying to explain, but to no avail
 satpathi or duusare log jo get par baithe hue the uthne ko taiyaar nahin the
 Tathagata Satpathy had said that Bhubaneswar will not let Bhopal go until the flight leaves
 kuch samaj nahin aa rahaa tha
 People on both sides were making noise, but to no avail
 air india kii taraf se koi senior officer nahin tha jo logon ko samajha sake
 Tathagata Satpathy was repeatedly saying that the crew of Bhubaneswar flight has been sent for Bhopal flight due to a minister from Madhya Pradesh and two judges
 satpathi baar-baar kah rahe the ki ek mantri aisa kaise kar saktaa he? mantri or jaj bhopal jane vaale the
 The comments phir kuch der baad air india ke taraf se kuch senior oficial aae
 Trying to explain, but to no avail
 satpathi kaa kahana tha jab tak bhubaneshwar flite nahin jaaegi, vah get se nahin hatenge
 Many times the manager of Air India was saying that the crew was going to arrive in five minutes, but Satpathy said that start boarding first, he will only get up
 is tarah teen ghante tak protest chalata rahaa
 The boarding of the Bhubaneswar flight started at around 2 pm
 tab tak bhopal flite khadi thi
 Don't know whether the Bhopal flight left later? baat chaahe jo bhi ho
 Many mistakes were made by Air India
 sabase bada sawaal yah he ki ek mantri ke saamne air india kaise jhuk gai
 If you did not bow, then how could you not convince an MP? agar saansad logon ke saath milakar galat protest kar rahe the to air india ko kadam uthaane chahie the
 No concrete information was being provided about the flight from Air India
 sirf aadhe ghante pehle pataa chalata he ki flite 4 ghante let he
 The flight does not depart even after the time of flight nor is any information given

 air india kii in galatiyon kii vajah se bhubaneshwar ke saath-saath bhopal jane vaale logon ko bhi pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 After some time some air hostess reached near the gate
 log tali bajaane lage, lekin yah kya
 
 
 This air hostess then started entering from the flight gate to Bhopal
 logon ko samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ki jab bhopal flite radd hone kii anounsament kii ja chuki he to phir air hostess usee get se kyon ja rahi he
 Then standing at Bhuvaneshwar Gate, the manager of Air India went towards the flight gate known to Bhopal
 raat ke 11
 It was 15, but there was no information about the Bhubaneswar flight
 yah bhi bataaya nahin ja rahaa tha kii flite jaaegi yaa nahin
 After some time people started talking that the crew going to Bhubaneswar has been sent for Bhopal flight
 main bhi get ke paas khadaa tha
 People were talking that due to a VIP, the Bhopal flight, which had been canceled, would leave now and there was no information about the Bhubaneswar flight
 phir logon ko gussa aane laga
 Some distance away, Tathagata Satpathy of Biju Janata Dal MP from Odisha stood
 unhen bhi bhubaneshwar flite main janaa tha
 Senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai also reached near the gate
 unhone bhi apana tikat bhubaneshwar flite main book kiya tha
 Then what was to happen
 jab saansad satpathi ko pataa chalaa ki bhubaneshwar flite ke kru ko bhopal bhej diya gaya to vah naaraaz ho gaye
 Started Protesting
 boarding get ke saamne baith gaye
 Then everything was getting weird
 kuch log bhopal flite ke liye boarding kar chuke the or kuch log line main khadey hue the, lekin unhen jane nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 Due to the protest, security personnel reached here
 samajhane kii koshish karne lage, lekin koi phayda nahin
 Satpathy and the others who were sitting at the gate were not ready to get up
 tathagat satpathi kaa kahana tha jab tak bhubaneshwar flite nahin jaaegi, tab tak bhopal flite ko jane nahin denge
 i could not understand anything
 donon taraf ke log shor machaa rahe the, lekin koi phayda nahin
 There was no senior officer from Air India who could explain to the people
 tathagat satpathi baar-baar yah kah rahe the ki madhya pradesh ke ek mantri or do jajon kii vajah se bhubaneshwar flite ke kru ko bhopal flite ke liye bhej diya gaya he
 Satpathy was repeatedly saying how can a minister do this? The minister and the judge were going to Bhopal
 tippaniyan Then some senior officials came from Air India later
 samajhane kii koshish kar rahe the, lekin koi phayda nahin hua
 Satpathy said he would not step out of the gate until the Bhubaneswar flight departed
 kai baar air india ke manager yah kah rahe the ki kru paanch minute main pahunchane vaala he, lekin satpathi kaa kahana tha ki pehle boarding shuru kiijie, vah tabhi uthenge
 In this way, the Protest continued for three hours
 raat ko kareeb do baje bhubaneshwar flite kii boarding shuru hui
 Till then the Bhopal flight was standing
 pataa nahin baad main bhopal flite ravaanaa hui yaa nahin? Whatever the case may be
 air india kii taraf se kai galtiyaan kii gayi
 The biggest question is how Air India bowed down to a minister
 agar nahin jhuki to phir ek saansad ko kaise nahin samajha pai
 If mps were doing a wrong protest along with the people then Air India should have taken steps
 air india kii taraf se flite ko lekar koi thos jaankaree bhi nahin di ja rahi thi
 Only half an hour before the flight is revealed to be 4 hours late
 flite kaa samay ho jane ke baad bhi flite ravaanaa nahin hoti he or na hi koi jaankaree di jaati he
 Due to these mistakes of Air India, people going to Bhubaneswar as well as Bhopal also faced problems
 thodi der baad log yah baat karne lage ki bhubaneshwar jane vaale kru ko bhopal flite ke liye ravaanaa kar diya gaya he
 i was also standing near the gate
 log yah baat kar rahe the ki kisi viipi kii vajah se bhopal flite, jo radd ho chuki thi vah abhi ravaanaa hogi or bhubaneshwar flite ke bare main koi soochna nahin thi
 Then people started getting angry
 kuch dur odisha ke biju janata dal ke saansad tathagat satpathi khadey the
 He also had to board a Bhubaneswar flight

 If you did not bow, then how could you not convince an MP? agar saansad logon ke saath milakar galat protest kar rahe the to air india ko kadam uthaane chahie the
 No concrete information was being provided about the flight from Air India
 sirf aadhe ghante pehle pataa chalata he ki flite 4 ghante let he
 The flight does not depart even after the time of flight nor is any information given
 air india kii in galatiyon kii vajah se bhubaneshwar ke saath-saath bhopal jane vaale logon ko bhi pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Due to the protest, security personnel reached here
 samajhane kii koshish karne lage, lekin koi phayda nahin
 Satpathy and the others who were sitting at the gate were not ready to get up
 tathagat satpathi kaa kahana tha jab tak bhubaneshwar flite nahin jaaegi, tab tak bhopal flite ko jane nahin denge
 i could not understand anything
 donon taraf ke log shor machaa rahe the, lekin koi phayda nahin
 There was no senior officer from Air India who could explain to the people
 tathagat satpathi baar-baar yah kah rahe the ki madhya pradesh ke ek mantri or do jajon kii vajah se bhubaneshwar flite ke kru ko bhopal flite ke liye bhej diya gaya he
 Satpathy was repeatedly saying how can a minister do this? The minister and the judge were going to Bhopal
 tippaniyan Then some senior officials came from Air India later
 samajhane kii koshish kar rahe the, lekin koi phayda nahin hua
 Satpathy said he would not step out of the gate until the Bhubaneswar flight departed
 kai baar air india ke manager yah kah rahe the ki kru paanch minute main pahunchane vaala he, lekin satpathi kaa kahana tha ki pehle boarding shuru kiijie, vah tabhi uthenge
 In this way, the Protest continued for three hours
 raat ko kareeb do baje bhubaneshwar flite kii boarding shuru hui
 Till then the Bhopal flight was standing
 pataa nahin baad main bhopal flite ravaanaa hui yaa nahin? Whatever the case may be
 air india kii taraf se kai galtiyaan kii gayi
 The biggest question is how Air India bowed down to a minister
 agar nahin jhuki to phir ek saansad ko kaise nahin samajha pai
 If mps were doing a wrong protest along with the people then Air India should have taken steps
 air india kii taraf se flite ko lekar koi thos jaankaree bhi nahin di ja rahi thi
 Only half an hour before the flight is revealed to be 4 hours late
 flite kaa samay ho jane ke baad bhi flite ravaanaa nahin hoti he or na hi koi jaankaree di jaati he
 Due to these mistakes of Air India, people going to Bhubaneswar as well as Bhopal also faced problems
 phir kuch der baad air india ke taraf se kuch senior oficial aae
 Trying to explain, but to no avail
 satpathi kaa kahana tha jab tak bhubaneshwar flite nahin jaaegi, vah get se nahin hatenge
 Many times the manager of Air India was saying that the crew was going to arrive in five minutes, but Satpathy said that start boarding first, he will only get up
 is tarah teen ghante tak protest chalata rahaa
 The boarding of the Bhubaneswar flight started at around 2 pm
 tab tak bhopal flite khadi thi
 Don't know whether the Bhopal flight left later? baat chaahe jo bhi ho

 goswami tulsidas ne ramayana se or bhagwaan ram ke charitra par aadhaarit duusari kritiyon se prerana lee or ek or mahakavy ramcharita maanas kii rachana kii
 Tulsidas's Ramacharit Manas contains many illustrations and incidents from Valmiki's original Ramayana in a different way and even many episodes of the original Ramayana are not taken up in the Ramcharit Manas

 mahakavi surdaas ne apni vilakshan kalpana shakti se apane kavy main bhagwaan krishna ke rahasyamayi charitra ko nae sire se gadha he
 Mahakavi and dramatist Kalidas composed the Malavika Agnimitram, taking material from the works of the past and mentioning many historical events of the Sunga period, but no serious scholar of history would call this drama a historical drama

 Needless to say that history is not merely the details of dates and events

" " supreme court kaa faisla hindustan ke filmkaaron ke liye baari raahat kii tarah aayaa he
 It is the Mahabharata that gives us solace in such a tumultuous year, which says in the Van Parva: "shruti of a subject is discrete, memories are discrete

 There is not a single sage or philosopher whose ideas can be accepted as the ultimate truth

 Today, even after 21 years, no one knows what the findings of that investigation report were? Who was to blame for the incident? What were the instructions to ensure that such incidents do not recur? Khandwa Collector Mahesh Agrawal says, "the investigation report of Omkareshwar stampede case and its instructions were never received by the Khandwa district administration
" amuman yadi jile kaa koi adhikari isaki jaanch karata to uski report jarur jile main rahati chunki vah jaanch pramukh sachiv str ke adhikari ne kii thi isliye vah bhopal main hi shashan ko prastut kii hogi

 The question is whether the investigating officer of the incident, the then principal secretary KS Sharma submitted his investigation report to the government within the stipulated time? What did the government do with this report? If Khandwa district administration and Omkareshwar administration are not aware of the findings of this inquiry report, then what is the meaning of such report? Collector Mahesh Aggarwal tries to cover up the gross negligence of the government by saying that "such inquiry report is confidential

 co / ddko2wj5zu— Chowkidar Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 17, 2019 In a targeted assembly meeting on Congress on the issue of nationalism and army, he said that now the country wants to kill terrorists by entering into the house
 unhone kaha ki mujhe prasannataa he ki desh, rashtrawaad kii prerana, antyoday ke darshan or sushasan ke mantra ko lekar chal rahi bhaajapa ke prati apana vishwaas dikhaa rahaa he
 i am satisfied that in honor of our sons, the whole country is standing up in honor of Shaurya
 unhone kaha ki congress, sainikon se visheshadhikaar chhinane or deshadroh kaa kanoon khatm karne jaise vishyon ko lekar janata ke bich gai, jisko desh ne thukraa diya he
