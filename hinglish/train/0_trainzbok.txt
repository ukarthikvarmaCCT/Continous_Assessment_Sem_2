 MGP leader Sudhir Dhavalikar had told media persons that he can only support the BJP to bring it to power if Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar is given the responsibility of the post of Chief Minister of Goa
 MGP ke 3 vidhayak chunakar aae hai
 Dhavalikar was talking to media persons in Goa
 unhone bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ko khat likhakar apni baat spasht kar di thi
 9 mlas are needed to bring BJP to power in Goa
 aise main apane puraane sahyogi MGP kaa miltaa samarthan nakaarne kaa matlab hoga ki bijepi satta kii daud se dur ho jaae
 The tense relationship between Dhavalikar's Manohar Parrikar and the BJP came when Laxmikant Parsekar was made the Chief Minister of Goa
 parsekar dwaara MGP ke mantriyon ke kilaaf die bayaan ke baad MGP ne BJP sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya tha
 After this, the MGP in alliance with Shiv Sena and Goa Suraksha Manch challenged the BJP

 With his support, BJP will reach from 13 to 16
 MGP ke alaava goa forward bhi manohar parrikar ke netritv ko lekar sakaaratmak he

 Of these, BJP has fielded Prasad Gaonkar of Save Goa Front in the election and the BJP alliance's figure is reaching 20
 jabaki baaki bache 2 nirdaleeyon main se rohan khanvate par congress ne apana daanv lagaaya he
 Goa in-charge and senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh held a press conference and said that Rohan Khawante has met Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and will be with Congress
 haalanki, rohan khanvate or ensipi ke 1-1 vidhayak ke samarthan ke baad bhi bijepi gathbandhan ke mukaable congress gathbandhan 1 vidhayak peeche he
 Manohar Parrikar, who is going to become CM under these circumstances, will have to be made a member of the Goa Legislative Assembly within 6 months
 jiske liye vartmaan vidhayak kaa istifa jaruri he
 Significantly, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), which was ready to support the BJP, had put a condition that if Manohar Parrikar will be made the Chief Minister of Goa, then only he will give support
 MGP ke netaa sudhir dhavlikar ne mediakarmiyon se baatcheet main kaha tha ki ve bijepi ko satta main laane ke liye tabhi samarthan de sakate hai jab rakshaamantri manohar parrikar ko goa ke mukhyamantri pad kii jimmedaari di jaae
 The MGP has 3 elected mlas
 dhavlikar goa main mediakarmiyon se baat kar rahe the
 He made his point clear by writing a letter to BJP President Amit Shah
 goa main bijepi ko satta main laane ke liye 9 vidhayakon kii jarurat he
 In such a situation, denying the support of its old ally MGP would mean that the BJP gets away from the race for power
 dhavlikar ke manohar parrikar or bijepi se barkaraar rishton main khatas tab aayi jab lakshmikant parsekar ko goa kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya
 The MGP withdrew support to the BJP government after Parsekar's statement against MGP ministers
 iske baad MGP ne shivasena or goa suraksha manch ke saath gathjod kar bijepi ko chunauti di
 This alliance has won only 3 seats
 unke samarthan se bijepi 13 se 16 tak to pahunch jaaegi
 Apart from MGP, the Goa forward is also positive about Manohar Parrikar's leadership
 is gut ke paas bhi 3 vidhayakon kaa sankhyabal he
 Gut leader Vijay Sardesai told the media in Goa that Parrikar was a better person than the Congress
 congress ne goa forward ke ummidavaaron ko pratadit kiya he
 In such a situation, how will it be possible to support the Congress? With the support of Goa Forward too, BJP will get closer to majority and it can have the support of 19 mlas

 Smriti / Jagjit Singh 1941-2011 Perhaps no other singer is as close to Ghazal as Gajal singer Jagjit Singh
 khushi or sharaarat, donon unke saathi the
 When he was tying the audience with his magical voice in his eyes, a mischief flashed in his eyes
 isamen koi aashcharya kii baat nahin ki puri duniya main aadhe arab se zyada log unke diwane hai
 Nam Aakho bid farewell to Jagjit Singh
 Photographer says Nida Fazli, "this is the magic of Jagjit's voice
" usamen ek maa kii mithaas he, pita ke prem kaa saundarya he, kisi gahare pragadh rishte jaisi komalta he
 His voice is like an ointment on a wound
 vah aap tak aati he or bina kuch liye, maange waapas chali jaati he
 "it was this magical voice, which became quiet forever
" jab ve chote-se shahar ganganagar se apni kismat aajamaane mumbai mahanagar main aae the to ekadam yuva the
 Then he made his mark in the world of immense fame and success and music
 nahin rahe ghazal samraat jagajeet singh
 
 
 Exclusive videographer singer Rita Ganguly says, "I remember naming the great singer Begum Akhtar
" jalon kii recording ke liye echemavi main unka parichay karavaaya tha
 They came at a time when Talat Mahmud's voice had assumed a fixed form for Ghazal
 goonjati rahegi 'jag jeet' ne valiavajtab filmi sangeet main ek kism kaa dhimaa tehraav tha or jagajeet singh apni gitnuma gajalon ke saath sangeet kii duniya main hawa ke taaje jhonke kii tarah aae
 There was a uniqueness in his voice
 vah apni tarah kii niraali aawaaj thi
 You can imitate Kishore Kumar or Muhammad Rafi, but Jagjit's voice cannot be copied
 yahi kaaran he ki jagajeet singh to sirf ek hi rahegaa
 No one goes like this
 
 
 jagajeet singh main yah antarbodh tha ki shrota kya chaahate hai, thodaa-sa saath, saajhedaari or utsaah
 This was the case at all his concerts
 ve shrotaaon ke saath kaaphi sahaj the
 They knew how to get them drowned in music
 jaise ki ve shrotaaon ko bhi apane saath gane ke liye kehete yaa kores ke saath-saath khud bhi gaate the
 Exclusive: The journey of Jagjit Singh's life was his amazing art and technique of communication
 ve kehete the, ''mere gane kii kala, geeton or kavitaaon kaa chayan or sabase zyada mahatvapurn he shrotaaon ke saath samvaad
 Do you know why Lalu Prasad Yadav has such a name? Because they communicate better not only with the common man, but also in Parliament and on television
 yah kisi bhi kalakaar kii mul antarvastu he
 "he was absolutely right
" jab pop sangeet, rimix or item geeton ke jamaane main vaastavik sangeet ke liye astitv kaa sankat khadaa ho gaya or ghazal kaa mahatv kam hone laga to unhone apane video laanch kiye
 He became a Ghazal singer who also had a video
 unka kahana tha, ''aaj drishy chizon kaa jamaana he
 Today music is not heard, seen
 ek daur tha, jab sirf aawaaj or sangeet hamaari pahchaan thi, lekin ab hamen video par dikhnaa padataa he, apane album ko pramot karne ke liye concert karne padate hai, kyonki yahi bikta he
 Unfortunately, we too are caught in the grip of these things
 '' ve aadhunik bazaar ko bakhubi samajhte the or usee ke mutabik apane sangeet ko aage badhaane ke liye unhone koshishen bhi kin
 He also moved away from tradition to include instruments such as guitar and violin in his concerts
 unhone yah isliye kiya kyonki unhen apane sangeet main vaadyayantron or dhvaniyon kaa vaividhya utpann karnaa mahatvapurn laga
 Attending his concert was a complete, soul-enriching experience in itself
 unhone parampara se hatakar ek kaam or kiya
 He sang famous songs from the 50s, 60s and 70s of Lata Mangeshkar, Mukesh, Hemant Kumar, Talat Mehmood and Kishore Kumar in his album Close to the Heart
 isaki kaaphi aalochana bhi hui, lekin chaahane waalon ne ise haathon-haath liya
 Why is the emperor of Ghazal singing old-fashioned songs? He replied, "if Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle can do it, then why not me?" He was also a rebel of his kind
 mirza gaalib jaise pratishthit shaayaron ko janamanas main lokapriy banane ke alaava unhone nae kaviyon ko lokapriy banane kaa kaam bhi kiya
 Tragedies in life made him a different kind of person in later days
 pehle 21 varshiya bete vivek kii ek car durghatana main maut ho jane or phir sauteli beti kii mrityu ke baad ve kaaphi badal gaye
 He had become somewhat spiritual and said that music is the only ointment which can relieve him from his sufferings
 baad ke dinon main unhone aadhyatmik album jaise he ram, gurbani, krishna aadi nikaale
 All of which were quite a hit
 yahi unke sangeet or unki aawaaj kaa jaadu tha
 "he gave Ghazal a new twist," says Pandit Shivkumar Sharma, a santoor player
 '' ve ghazal ke bhavishya ko lekar chintit the
 He used to say that Ghazal singers should also understand poetry and culture
 aajkal to koi bhi kuch bhi ga rahaa he
 There is no wisdom, understanding and balance
 puraane dinon main ol india radio main aawaaj kaa audishan hota tha or aap jo kavita gaate the, use bhi kavi jaanchate the
 He used to be responsible
 mujhe to is baat kii chintaa he ki aane vaale samay main hamaari samskruti kaa kya hoga? hamaari aane vaali pidiyon kaa kya hoga? mujic companiyaan gayakon or kalakaaron ke saath jis tarah kaa vyavhaar karti hai, use lekar bhi ve kaaphi dukhi rahaa karte the
 Along with Ghazal singing, he composed music for many of the best films of his time
 filmon main diya gaya unka sangeet sabase alag or anoothaa tha
 His music had a distinct identity
 unka sangeet madhur hota tha or geeton ke shabd bahut arthpurna hua karte the
 In the last few years of his life, he could not surpass his inner artist
 lekin jo bhi ho, hindi cinema main unke gaae geeton kii ek lambii shrinkhalaa he, jo dukh main duube hue udhaas dilon ko raahat or aaraam pahunchane kaa kaam karti he
 He was truly blessed by God
 kuch logon kaa to kahana he ki ishwar ne unke gale ke liye khaastaur par sangeet ke taar nirmit kiye the
 And that was the one thing that set him apart from all the singers
 vah sunahari jaadui aawaaj vaale sant aatma theah tum chale jaaoge to sochenge, hamane kya khoyaa hamane kya paaya
 to regret! We lost a lot

 In Alwar, Rajasthan, a man was beaten to death on charges of cow smuggling
 use parivaar kaa ro-ro kar bura haal he
 The shadow of the father has risen from the heads of seven innocent children
 shanivaar raat is parivaar kaa sab kuch lut gaya
 Actually, the head of the family was brutally beaten to death by a mob in Lalvandi village of Ramgarh police station area of alwar district on charges of cow smuggling
 police ke mutabik shanivaar raat kareeb ek baje ke aasapaas unhen jaanakri mili thi kido taskarahai jo gaayon ko rajasthan se haryana kii taraf le ja rahe hai
 They have been surrounded and beaten by some people
 go-taskar samaj peetna shuru kiyamaamle kii jaankaree milane ke baad police maukey par pahunchi to kuch log bhaagate hue najar aae
 Two people were standing with two cows on the spot, while a man was found stained in mud in an injured condition
 jab ghayal shaks se uske bare main jaanakri lee gai to pataa laga ki uskaa naam rakabar he jo ki kol gaanv thana ferozepur haryana kaa rahane vaala he
 Rakbar told the police that he and his partner were buying two cows from Ladpur and going through the forest of Lalwandi village to their village on foot, when some people started thinking about being a smuggler
 kisi tarah se uskaa saathi asalam maukey se bhaagane main kaamyaab ho gaya
 After this, Rakbar suddenly fainted
 pulicene rakabar ko ghayal avasthaa main alvar ke rajeev gandhi saamaanya aspataal main bhartee karavaaya jahaan doctor ne usase mrit ghoshit kar diya
 According to the police, the case was registered 4 years ago, it has been found that in the year 2014, a case of cow-smuggling was registered against the deceased
 philhal is maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he ki ye cese go-taskari kaa he yaa nahin
 Police said that till now no evidence has been found in the investigation to prove that Rakbar and his companions had bought the cows, but the investigation of the case is on
 saath hi do logon hiraasat main liya gaya he jinka naam dharmendra yadav or paramjeet he
 According to Chashmidid Aslam, when he was coming back to buy the cow from Khanpur, some people surrounded him and started assaulting him without saying anything
 un logon ke haathon main hathiyaar the
 He also started firing in the air, after which Aslam saw an opportunity, but Rakbar got stuck there
 asalam kaa kahana he ki ye log 30-30 hajaar main do gaay kharid kar laa rahe the
 Rakbar's father Suleman, who lives in Kol village of Ferozepur tehsil of Haryana's Nuhoo district, says that Raqbar used to break stones in the mountain
 vah apane saathi ke saath bakre lene ke liye aayaa tha
 It has nothing to do with cow-smuggling
 lekin is baat ko jarur mana ki saal 2014 main rakabar pargo-taskarika cese darj hua tha, lekin wo is kaam ko chhod chukaa tha
 The father says that Rakbar was just 38 years old and has 7 children
 aaj ye log insaaf kii maang kar rahe hai, to vahiin rakabar ke bade bhai ke mutabik rakabar mazdooree ke saath-saath gaay bhi paalataa tha or doodh bechney kaa kaam karata tha
 He said that Rakbar went by telling that he was going to get the cow, but did not say where
 ab bacchon kaa kya hogaarkabar kii saas ke mutabik rakabar ke 7 bachche hai or wo ghar me akelaa kamaane vaala tha
 What will happen to their children now? baharhaal, police is maamle main hiraasat main liye donon logon se poochtacha kar baaki logon ke bare main jaankaree jutaney main lagi hui he
 Police say that there may be some more arrests in the case soon, but the question arises that this is not the first time that a mob has beaten someone to death on charges of cow-trafficking
 isse pehle bhi aisa ho chukaa he
 Claims of all action were also made in such a case, despite repeated occurrence of such incidents raises many questions

 The investigation team is also investigating Giri's involvement in the incident
 saath hi anya 6 aropiyon (jinamein se moti paswan ne do yuvakon ko hi pahchaanane kii baat kahi he) kii talash jari he
 Let us know that Moti Lal Paswan, an accused in the Kanpur rail accident, was arrested from Motihari in Bihar
 gauratlab he ki upi ke dijipi jaavid ahmedkanpur rail hadaseki jaanch main jaraa bhi kotahi nahin baratna chaahate hai, lihaaja aiji aties or aiji railway ko guuruuvaar ko motihari bheja gaya

 karnataka kii satta ko barkaar rakhane ke liye congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi rajya ke chaar divasiy daure par hai
 He has conducted four political experiments to create a political atmosphere in favor of Congress in the assembly elections due this year
 bataa den ki do maheene ke baad hi karnataka main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 While the Congress is desperate to regain power over the state, the BJP is trying its best to return to power under the leadership of BS Yeddyurappa
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne isi ke tahat mishan karnataka main apni party kaa chunavi bigul foonka he
 In his first tour, Rahul has done 4 experiments in 4 days: 1
 lingayat samudaay par najrarahul gandhi is baar lingayaton ko congress ke paale main karne kii purazor koshish kar rahe hai
 The Lingayat community is around 18 per cent in the state and is considered a political kingmaker in the state
 rahul ne jis tarah lingayat prabhaavshaalee ilaakon main daure kiye hai wo congress kii sochi samajhi ranneeti kaa hissaa tha
 Lingayats are considered a strong vote bank of the BJP
 rahul ne rajya ke lingayat samudaay ke varchasv vaale 6 jilon main yatra kii
 Rahul visited the religious monasteries associated with the Lingayat community during the four-day tour
 wo hospet sthit huligama (shakti) mandir, coppal main gavi siddheshwara math or basavakalyan sthit anubhava mantapa bhi gaye
 
 basavakalyan ko 12veen sadi ke samaaj sudhaarak baswana ke kaaran janaa jaataa he
 Rahul's move among Lingayats was also important because Siddaramaiah, the Chief Minister of the state's Congress government, had given rise to a demand for a new religious identity by a group of Lingayats separating them from Hindus
 bijepi ke siem phase yedurappa lingayat samudaay se hi aate hai or rahul apni ranneeti se isaki kaat kii taiyaari main he
 2
 mandir main puja-dargah kii jiyaaratgujrat kii tarah karnataka main rahul gandhi sirf 'soft hindutv' kii raajnneeti hi nahin kar rahe hai, balki dharmanirpeksh card khel rahe hai
 Here too, he is busy trying both Hindu and Muslim on the pretext of visiting the temple and the mosque
 raichur or gulberga daure ke dauraan mandir main puja bhi kii or dargah jaakar chadar bhi chadhaai
 The Muslim population in Karnataka is 12 percent
 isiilie rahul karnataka main muslimon ko darkinar karne kii galati nahin kar sakate
 In view of this, the religious places of both communities are seen bowing their heads

 Coastal Politics: Rawal's mission is to see coastal politics in Karnataka
 rahul gandhi ne apane mishan karnataka kii shuruyaat congress kii majboot pakad vaale hyderabad-karnataka kshetra se kii
 Out of the total 40 seats in this area, 23 are held by Congress
 bijepi ne costal ilaakon kii siton ko 2019 ke liye target kiya he
 In such a situation, this strategy of Rahul is being seen in an effort to save his stronghold in Karnataka as well as to try to sabotage the bjp's plans

 On tribal-farmers-traders, Fokrahul Gandhi also visited the farmers and tribals of the state during his visit to Karnataka
 itnaa hi nahin unhone vyapaariyon or profeshnals ke saath bhi mulaakaat kii
 Rahul has attacked PM Modi in a befitting manner from Karnataka
 rahul gandhi ne kaha,'wo aapako jhuthe vaade karte hai, jhuthe sapane dikhaate hai or unpar bharosa karke aapako koi phayda nahin milane vaala he, congress party jo kahati he wo karti he narendra modi ji ke shabd khokhale hai, wo jo kehete he wo karte nahin he
 'rahul said that Modi ji talks about the poor, but his government gives 55 thousand crore rupees to the whole of India in SC plan and Tribal sub-plan, while Siddaramaiah gives 27 thousand 700 crore rupees in only one state
 iske alaava rahul gandhi ne sadak kinare aam logon kii tarj par pakora khaaya or chaay bhi piya
 Rahul pays special attention to People Connect in his election tours
 gujarat chunaav ke dauraan chowk-chauraahon par chaay party or dhokala party se logon ke bich rahul ne apana sampark majboot kiya tha

 subramanyam ne mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko likhe ek patr main kaha, 'main is samaj ke aadhaar par kaam ko sweekaar karuunga ki ayog kaa uddeshy sakaaratmak he or sarkaar ko cricket ko behatar or ucch str par le jane main labhanvit hona chahie
 ' unhone saath hi kaha ki yah zikr karnaa sahi hoga ki arun jetali jinka naam khabaron main aayaa he, wo takreeban 37 varshon se mere moolyawaan or utkrisht saathi hai
 Speaking to NDTV, Gopal Subramaniam said that Arun would call Jaitley for questioning if needed
 subramanyam ne ye bhi kaha ki maine dilli sarkaar ko bataa diya he ki jetali mere mitra rahe hai, lekin main ayog ke adhyaksh ke taur par peshewar tareeke se kaam karuunga

 Apart from familism in Himachal Pradesh, the power and functioning of the government of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has not yet been appreciated

 P
 nadda or mukhyamantri jairam thakur ke centre main badhate rutabe se dhumal parivaar kii bhoomika gaun ho gai thi
 With this, Dhumal supporters have raised the demand for giving him the post of president through social media
 lekin aadhikarik taur par party ke netaa isse inkaar karte hai
 Mangal Pandey, bjp's state in-charge, who came to the state on a two-day tour, says, "when the government is formed, there are many expectations
" parivaar main kabhi vichaaron main bhed ho jaataa he
 But everyone's solution comes out of the conversation
 himachal main party ke log ekadam ek saath hai
 "the reason why there is no coronation in boards and corporations so far is that there is no consensus on the appointments
" isiilie kendriya mantri nadda, party adhyaksh satpal satti or purv mukhyamantri prem kumaar dhumal ke prastaavit naamon ko mukhyamantri ne hikeman ko saunp diya he
 It is not only that the names of the party get the green signal in the coronation, but also interestingly that even Chief Minister Jairam Thakur is not able to beat the rhythm
 nadda kaa prabhaav, saansad shanta kumaar tathaa anuraag thakur ke sampark or phir dhumal kaa asar, ye kuch aisi baaten hai jinase jairam khulkar kaam nahin kar paa rahe hai
 However, he says, "it's been only 6 months
" hamaara focus vikaas par he
 i am getting the guidance and affection of senior party leaders
 main din-raat mehnat karke unki apekshaaon par khara utaruunga
 However, the struggle to take the government work towards development continues

 But for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has no major issue to surround the Congress in the state
 hairaani ki vipaksh or sarkaar kaa dostana maahaul bhi lagaataar bana hua he
 Because former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh wants to save himself from the attacks of CBI and ED, the sluggish Congress unit is unable to speak on the BJP government
 udhar, prem kumaar dhumal kii chintaa kii ek or bhi vajah he
 Actually, the case made by Virbhadra Singh in the case of Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association, Jayaram government has not been able to withdraw it despite coming to power due to technical screws
 duusari ore, nadda khud ko himachal main sthapit karnaa chaahate hai
 For these reasons, the challenges of Chief Minister Jairam Thakur have increased considerably
 sarkaar chalaane or sabhi ke saath talmail banaae rakhane kii koshish main kuch mantriyon ke 'kharaab' pradarshan par bhi ve kuch bol nahin paa rahe hai
 The Chief Minister, instead of the party unit, will be responsible for winning 4 seats in the next Lok Sabha elections

 aakhirkaar bhaajapa kii ranneeti safal rahi or vah congress ke paramparaagat matdaaon ko apane paksh main laane main safal rahi
 If we look at the political turmoil before the assembly elections, then it is clear that the biggest reason for the Congress's sinking of the loot was rebellion
 iske alaava bhitarghaat bhi party kii haar kaa kaaran bani

 Therefore, Vijay Bahuguna could not stay in power for long and the party removed him and handed over the reins to Harish Rawat
 congress sarkaar kii asthirataa kaa party kaaryakartaaon or aam logon ke bich nakaaratmak sandesh gaya
 As a result, the Congress' loot was drowned
 itnaa hi nahin, Harish Rawat ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad bhi congress rajya kii janata ko sthir sarkaar dene main vifal rahi
 Nine Congress mlas led by former Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna joined the BJP and the Modi government at the Center sacked the Harish Rawat government and imposed President's rule in the state
 haalanki baad main supreme court ne Harish Rawat sarkaar ko behaal kar diya or vah phir mukhyamantri ban gaye, lekin janata kii adaalat main vah jeet nahin paae
 Alam is that he himself could not save his seats

 Let me tell you, while raising the Kashmir issue in the United Nations General Assembly last month, Mahathir alleged that India has 'invaded and occupied' Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha tha ki bharat ko is mudde ke samaadhaan ke liye pakistan ke saath kaam karnaa chahie
 However, India's Foreign Ministry had reacted strongly to Mahathir's statement
 austria kii rajdhani vienna main shuukravaar ko opek deshon kii baithak honi he
 Before this meeting, tension has started between Saudi Arabia and Iran to increase the production of crude oil
 ek taraf jahaan saudi arab kachche tel kaa production badhaane par jor de rahaa he
 At the same time, Iran stands against it
 'aapurti banaae rakhane ke liye jo bhi karnaa hoga, karenge'baithak se pehlesaudi arab ne viennaamen buudhvaar ko kaha ki duniyabar main kachche tel kii aapurti kam na ho, iske liye vah jo bhi jaruri hoga, vah kadam uthayega
 Abdul Aziz bin Salman, Saudi's Prince and Energy Minister, said, "we will do whatever we can to maintain stability in the market
" ham ye sunishchit karenge ki kachche tel kii aapurti main kisi tarah kii kami na ho
 "saudi Arabia said that global demand for crude oil will increase in the coming month
" is vajah se hamaari koshish he ki kachche tel kii aapurti kam na ho

 He said here, "the political circumstances of many countries affect the supply of external and sometimes internal crude oil
 aise main ham opek deshon se ummid karte hai ki ve kachche tel kii aapurti ko puraa karne ke liye jaruri kadam uthaaenge
 Iran is protesting on one side where Saudi Arabia and Russia want to focus on increasing the supply of crude oil

 He has said that he will oppose the proposal

 aise main vah kachche tel kaa production badhaane kaa virodh kar rahaa he
 'trump responsible for rising crude oil prices' Iran oil minister Bijan Namdar Janganeh once again said that he would oppose increasing crude production
 unhone kaha ki kachche tel kii keemton main oochaal ke liye khud america raashtrapati donald trump jimmedaar hai
 According to Janganeh, the embargo on Iran and Venezuela from the US has caused a crisis of supply of crude oil
 isaki vajah se keemten bad rahi hai

 After all, it has placed 19 women in its 36 companies on directors or similar high positions

 He changed the fortunes of almost every girl associated with him
 kisi ko tohfe main bmdablyoo car di, to kisi par puraa showrooms hi nyochaavar kar diya
 It was Kanda's eyesight that many modest women employees like Geetika rose to high positions in the company overnight
 lekin yah mahaj ittefaq nahin he ki sharaab se tauba or shabaab se muhabbat karne vaale kanda ne zyaadaatar unheen hasinaaon kaa uddhaar kiya jo yaa to avivaahit thim yaa phir apane pati ko chhodie ko taiyaar
 The eldest son of the staunch Sanghi Muralidhar Kanda, who lost the assembly elections from Sirsa on a Jan Sangh ticket in 1952, knew from the beginning what things are most spoken in the corridors of politics
 kanda ke aradhy tara baba kii kutiyaa main uske sahyogi rahe liladhar saini kaaphi soch vichaar kar yah daawa karte hai, "gopal ke dimag se shcoke shastrya kii tarj vaale saste upanyaason kii ve kahaniyaan kabhi nahin utrin jinamein aurat or paise ke bal par har cheez hasil karne kii misaalen bhari hoti hai
 His bookstore may not have run, but these books made his mind go well
 " kabhi uske siyaasi rahanuma rahe ajay chatala kehete hai, "vah shuddh rup se dalal he
 If investigated in depth, this case will prove to be the biggest sex racket in the country
 "lekin in aaropon se beparwaah kanda paisa kamaane ke safar par aage badhata gaya or uski raajadaar mahilaon kii sankhya bhi badhati rahi
 Geetika Sharma, Ankita Singh, Nupur Mehta and Aruna Singh are just a few names that went public due to a legal tussle, but there are more girls in Kanda's world whose growth graphs these women
 sirsa main uske parivaar ke kaarobaar ko dekhne vaali ek ladki ke parivaar kii kismat chand saal main badal gai
 Previously, where the financial condition of this girl's family was poor, now her father is running a showroom of cars
 kanda kii ek or company main ek mahila bahut teji se sioo ke pad tak pahunch gai
 a man who had been a driver of Kanda for a long time told, "after coming to Gurgaon, Kanda Saheb recruited a woman secretary
 secretary ko saaf nirdesh tha ki vah file paas karake laae, bhale hi iskeliye kuch bhi karnaa pade
 "doing anything for success is like Kanda's mantra
 uski kitabon kii dukaan (1979), jupiter electronics (1982), juuton kii dukaan (1985), bottleband pani or juuta banane kii factory ek ke baad ek naakaam huin lekin uske hausale kabhi post nahin hue
 She opened MDLR Airlines but was in a loss
 goa main do casino khole, ve bhi kabhi chal nahin sake
 But the number of girls in his life and business continued to grow
 saath hi shandaar partiyaan or beshkeemtee gift dene ke uske shauk par bhi koi asar nahin padaa
 Saini explains, "I asked Kanda that brother, your business is running in losses, then why have you kept so many girls in airlines? Why do you stick to the business of losses
" jawaab main kanda ne kaha tha ki saini tum tehre bhagat aadmi
 What will you understand about business? ye ladkiyaan or hawaii jahaaj munafa kamaane ke liye nahin, rasukhdaar logon main apni pahunch banane ke liye hai
 "and something similar happened
 1997 main tara baba ke 'aadesh' par sirsa chhod gudgaanv aae kanda ne real estate ke maidan main ubharate is kasbe kii nabj ko jaise pakad liya
 Kanda came close to Gurgaon's real estate business after he came close to the late Surendra Singh, son of former Haryana Chief Minister Bansi Lal
 phir garaj padi to ajay chatala ke 'juute' bhi khaae
 After 2003, there was a time when it would have been impossible to make any big land deal in Gurgaon without Kanda, who was doing a small business of changing the land use of the plot allocated to the Scheduled Castes
 uske sahyogi surendra minchnaavadi kehete hai, "kanda property kaa keedaa he
 Just like a kabaddi recognizes a pricey thing in a junk from the junk mountain, Kanda bets on the right property
 " kanda ne property ke dhandhe main apane bemisaal hunar se paisa kamaaya
 He never delayed to understand the pulse of politics
 jab kanda ne dekha ki 2009 main bhupendra singh hooda haryana ke takht par dobaaraa kabiz ho gaye hai to vah turant hooda ke kheme main shaamil ho gaya
 His friendship with Hooda reached Gaharai and the chief minister started feeding cakes at his birthday party (see box)
 darasal, berthde party shuru se hi kanda ke jansampark abhiyaan kaa bada manch rahi
 He gave his first major birthday party in 1998 at the Bristol Hotel in Gurgaon, where Surendra Singh was also present
 kanda ne jald hi gudgaanv main apana farm house banaaya
 And before his arrest in this farm house, there used to be fabulous parties twice a week
 khud sharaab ko haath na lagane vaala kanda in partiyon main sharaab kii nadiyaan baha detaa tha
 According to a person attending the parties, Russian and Uzbek girls were also seen here along with Indian girls
 daulat kaa nasha badha to kanda ne 2009 main goa main mint casino bhi kharida
 The biggest nobles of Haryana did not do the work that Kanda did and took 40 people from Haryana to the inauguration of the casino
 uske nimantran patr kii khaasiyat yah thi ki card ke saath aane-jane ke hawaii tikat chaspaan the
 Many who went to the casino party confirmed that it was the best party of his life, where he enjoyed everything that the common man thinks in his dreams
 goa ke ye do casino 'mint' or 'casino rio' kanda kii jindagi main khaas mahatv rakhte hai
 In fact, Kanda wanted to settle his alleged partner Ankita Singh away from Sirsa in a place where his family could not interfere and the search for such a place ended up as a casino in Goa
 haalanki iske baad bhi ankitha gudgaanv aati-jaati rahi
 Ankita has been in Singapore with her child since Geetika's suicide scandal and till now the police have not been able to interrogate her
 inhen casino main baad main kanda apni ek or puraani sahyogi noopur mehta ko bhi le aayaa
 He is the same Nupur Mehta whose name came up in the cricket match fixing controversy a few months ago
 kanda-noopur ke rishte utaar-chadhaav bhare rahe
 According to police sources, Kanda has said that he had given a house of 500 square yards to Nupur in Gurgaon as a gift
 lekin jab noopur pehali baar usase alag hui to 2009 main kanda ne gunde bhejkar us makaan ko khaali bhi kara liya
 However, Nupur has denied any such gifts
 ise kanda kii badakismati hi kahenge ki usne geetika ko bhi goa bhej diya
 According to the police, there was a fierce battle among the three women regarding their proximity to Kanda
 noopur or ankitha ne yahaan geetika ke khilaaf cese bhi darj karaayaa tha
 On the other hand, Aruna Chadda, the oldest ruler of Kanda, has been described by Geetika as the kingpin of the entire Khurafat in her suicide note
 ek bachche kii maa aruna bhi apane pati se alag rahati he
 Aruna, who once held the entire MDLR group at her fingertips, is currently in jail and nobody is going to ask about her condition
 us par aarope he ki company kii echaar vibhaag kii pramukh hone ke naate vah company main ladakiyon kii bhartee karne or unhen kanda kii karatuuton main shaamil hone ke liye majaboor karti thi
 The police is spewing out one secret each from this royalty of Kanda and Kanda is reciting Hanuman Chalisa in judicial custody
 geetika ke suicide note main kanda ke liye likhe shabd 'bura aadmi' ne uski takadir kii rekhaaen ulajh di hai
 Two days before Geetika's death, Kanda bought a new red Hummer car
 isi din usne media se anaupchaarik baatcheet main kaha tha ki usne haryana main aisi 24 siton kii pahchaan kii he jahaan vaisya votaron kaa dabadabaa he
 In these seats, he will field his candidates and then without his will no one will be able to become Chief Minister in Haryana
 yani kanda hoga haryana kii siyasat kaa betaj badshaah
 Kanda's ambition was to be high, but in the arrogance of power and wealth he forgot that a woman is not a toy
 stri, purush ke mohpash main to jakad sakati he, lekin hameshaa ke liye uski tarakkee kii baazaaroo seedhi nahin ban sakati
 Despite being buried under Kanda's favor, Geetika thought it better to end herself rather than surrender
 uski maut hi kanda kii barabaadi kii vajah ban gai
 Politicians often learn such lessons by paying a high price
 or tab tak der ho chuki hoti he
 This article is taken from India Today's September 2012 issue dilli main chunaav prachaar tham gaya
 Now the ball is in the court of voters which party gives power to Delhi
 kya shila dikshit lagaataar chauthi baar soobe kii siem banengi yaa dow
 With the clean image of Harshvardhan, BJP will hold the seat of power after 15 years or Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party will create history for the first time in electoral politics
 dilli kii satta ke in teenon daavedaaron kii kismat un 25 siton par nirbhar he, jo aakhri maukey par kisi bhi party ke paale main ja sakati he
 It is also shocking that Chief Minister Sheila Dixit's constituency New Delhi is also included in these 25 seats
 sabsidiari intelligence beuro ke chunavi survey kii maane, to is baar dilli main badarpur, timarpur, rajouri garden, shahaadaraa, malviya nagar, aarake puram, rajendra nagar, rithala, hari nagar or adarsh nagar main muqabla trikoniya he
 Significantly, in the last assembly elections, these seats were either with the Congress or the BJP
 survey ke mutabik congress or bijepi ke paale 20-20 seat vahiin aap ke hisse main 5 seat janaa tay he
 But with the coming of the Aam Aadmi Party in the remaining 25 seats, the election riot has become even more fun
 kaha jaataa he ki dilli desh kaa mood bataati he, isliye congress or bijepi ke liye dilli jeetna sabase ahm he
 There is a tremendous public mood in the capital on inflation and corruption, but the arrival of the AAP clearly reflects the troubles on both the main parties
 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main in 25 siton par congress or bijepi ke bich kaante kaa mukaable dekhne ko mila tha par survey ne ishaara kiya he ki AAP is baar donon partiyon ke manshaa par pani pher sakati he
 Let us tell you that in Delhi the voting is to be held on 4 December and the counting of votes will be on 8 December

 ) ji haa, ham baat kar rahe hai congressiyon kii bhaiyyaji yani priyanka gandhi wadra kii
 He is specially called as Bhaiyyaji, a Congressman from Rae Bareli and Amethi
 gandhi parivaar ke garh yani amethi- raibareli main 4 siton par sapa-congress ke ummidavaar aamane saamne hai, halaat kaabo main karne kii maathapai jari he, isi ke chalate priyanka ne vailemtine de yani 14 farvari se amethi raibareli kaa saghan prachaar abhiyaan taal diya
 Priyanka's close friends were calling it right, so all the workers were waiting for their brother
 isi bich achaanak raibareli kii reliyon main 17 farvari ko bhai rahul ke saath priyanka kaa kaarykram bana
 In the Congress, Rahul is replacing Sonia and Priyanka is only in the role of her ally, here also Priyanka took special care of this
 pehali raily main sirf rahul bole, priyanka sirf manch par baithi
 The message was clear that they should not come in the way of Rahul's glow
 indira jaisi chhaviiske baad raibareli kii duusari raily main priyanka manch par ain or mike sambhala
 She considers herself like Indira and the workers also see the image of Indira in them, so Priyanka also takes great care of it
 indira kii hair style,indiraqi tarah sari pahanane kaa andaaz or indira ke andaaz main bhaashan dene kii kala to sabhi ne pehle bhi dekhi he, lekin is baar umr ke 45 basant paar kar chukin priyanka ke haath main chashma bhi dikhaa, jo bhaashan dete vaqt bhi unke haath main tha, jo kabhi indira rakhti thim
 Priyanka's seal now focuses on Priyanka's speech
 upi ke pehle siyaasi bhaashan main priyanka ne vahi theme apanaayi, jiske chalate sapa or congress kaa gathbandhan hua
 That is, BJP should be formed by forming alliances like Bihar
 bihar kii hi tarj par nitish kii tarah akhilesh aage bad kar ladate dikhen, nitish kii chhavi kii tarah akhilesh kii chhavi ko aage rakhaa jaae
 All that is done, then PK, Prashant Kishore, like Bihar, made 'his boy vs outsider Modi' as 'bihari vs outsider'
 jab ye theme final hua, tab priyanka ne hi usko hari jhandi di thi
 So Priyanka started by encircling PM Modi in this speech
 modi par hamalapriyanka ne kaha ki, upi ko kisi bahari kii zarurat nahin, yahaan kaa har yuva netaa ban saktaa he
 Now people are not going to come in jams and hollow promises, all are sensible
 rahul or akhilesh ke dilojaan main upi he
 After this came the turn of demonetisation and law and order
 lafjon kii baazeegari dikhaate hue priyanka ne donon ko joda
 Bolin talks about atrocities on women, but the biggest atrocities happened to women since 6 months, when they stripped their savings and put them in line
 priyanka ne piem ko gherte hue kaha ki, mahila ko kisi vyakti kii bahan, maa yaa patni se sambodhit karne kii bajaay usko vyaktigat taur par pahchaan di jaani chahie
 Overall, Priyanka did all that was expected during the first election summer
 haalankismriti iranike hamalon kaa jawaab dene kii bajaay unhone piem modi ko hi nishane par rakhaa
 The change in strategy but the question is the same, in 2007, Priyanka held more than 100 rallies in the Gandhi family stronghold and the Congress won 7 out of 10 seats
 priyanka kaa khub danka baja, lekin 2012 main bhi 100 se zyaada reliyaan or nukkad sabhaayen karne ke baavjood congress mahaj do siten hi jeet sakin
 In such a situation, Priyanka's image may be hurt this time if the result of SP and Congress candidates fighting in 4 seats is not better
 isliye congress or priyanka kii ranneeti main aakhir vaqt main badlaav aayaa, unka prachaar abhiyaan simit kar diya gaya
 After all, the Congress does not want to risk 2019 by placing bets on its trumpet in 2017
 jin ilaakon main kuch hafte pehle tak sookhe kaa kahar tha, vahaan ab baadh kaa kahar he
 Then we were looking at drought in the context of climate change
 ab baadh kaa bhayankar kahar he, ab ham baadh ko jalwaayu parivartan kii nazar se dekh rahe hai
 Due to floods on the ground, there are policies made by humans, which is called Man Made Crisis
 prakritik sansadhano kaa bemauf istamaal jalwaayu parivartan ke kaarnon ko badhaata he
 Understand this flood in two ways
 do maheene kii barish agar do hafte main ho jaae to kya hoga
 Why is this happening? aap maane yaa na maane jo log oonche baandhon, carbon utsarjan, or nadiyon ke kinare nirmaan kaaryon ko lekar chetavanee dete rahe hai, jinhen ham export kehete hai, bulaate hai or sunakar bhula dete hai, unka mazaaq udaate hai, lekin unki ek ek baat sahi sabit hoti ja rahi he
 His articles have been proved correct for many decades
 is tabaahi main arabon rupee kii sampatti or janmaal kii barbaadi hui he
 We want to forget but rivers and nature are not letting us forget
 aap tivi par helicopter se baadh kaa survey karte mukhyamantriyon ko dekhte honge
 Ever imagine what they would see while sitting in a helicopter
 pani kaa vistaar dube hue ghar or ped dikhaai dete honge lekin kya unhen apni nitiyon or yojanaon kaa karaab asar bhi dikhataa hoga, kya ve sochate honge ki nadi ke kinare kii zamin agar bachi hoti, ped agar bache hote to shaayad itani tabaahi nahin hoti
 i do not think any Chief Minister should be self-reliant
 helicopter daure kaa yah video kisi mukhyamantri ke samvedansheel hone kaa nahin he, balki baadh or tabaahi ke kaarnon ke prati lagaataar udasin bane rahane kaa he
 So listen carefully to what the Chief Minister is saying after the helicopter survey
 unke bayaan main aankade sunai denge, kitne mare, kitne prabhavit hai, muawza kii raashi kitni he or raahat va bachaav kaaryon ke bare main baat kar rahe honge lekin nadiyon ke saath jo ho rahaa he us par nahin bolenge
 Looking at these pictures, we are seeing the river as the culprit right now
 khud insaan ne nadi ke saath kya aparaadh kiya he
 You must have heard about the plan of beautification of the river these days
 sarkaron ko pataa he ki nadi ke kinare karmkand ke liye log aate hai isliye ghat kii sajaavat par kaaphi paisa kharch kiya jaataa he, taaki lage ki vikaas ho rahaa he
 Crores of rupees are being planned
 lekin chamak ke naam par ho rahi is morrkhtaa ke peeche kitna paisa barbaad ho rahaa he iskaa hisaab nahin
 In one video, it is seen that an elephant made by the river is flowing due to erosion
 tivi ne sirf yahi bataaya hoga ki baadh ke pani main kaise cement kaa bana vishalkay hathi dhah rahaa he or jiraph gir kar bah rahaa he
 One place in Andhra Pradesh is Srikakulam
 yah video sirf baadh kii dhara main cement ke bane hathi or jiraph ke bah jane kaa nahin he
 The Bansadhara river has flooded here
 iske kaaran kalingapattanam bich par 30 feet aage tak pani aa gaya or yah sab kuch bah gaya
 Two elephants, two giraffes and a statue of Buddha were swept away in the water
 sthaneey media kii report ke anusaar bich hi bah gaya he
 It was created by the tourism department to attract tourists
 ab aap ise behate hue dekhte hai lekan yah nahin dekhte hai ki hamaari nitiyaan or yojanaayen kis had tak asthaayee sabit hoti ja rahi hai
 So this money was wasted, but keep it in writing, tourism here and elsewhere will also do the same again
 cement kii murti banaaenge

 There is a strong tussle between two leaders of Bihar's politics - Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Sushil Modi and senior RJD leader and former MP Shivanand Tiwari over Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's stand on Article 370
 isaki shuruyaat upmukhyamantri susheel modi ne kii thi, jab unhone somvaar ko ek twit main kaha, dow
 Ambedkar had opposed the imposition of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and due to this article neither the Mandal Commission's report could be implemented in the border state (jammu and Kashmir), nor did the Dalits and backward get the benefit of reservation
 susheel modi ke mutabik, pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab kashmir kaa kalank bane ek asthaayee anuchhed ko samaapt kar reserveshan kaa rasta saaf kar diya he, tab reserveshan kaa maseehaa banane vaale lalu prasad yadav kii party sarkaar ke faisle kaa virodh kyon kar rahi he
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister again said about BSP supremo Mayawati when she not only supported the bold decision to withdraw Article 370, but clearly opposed the 11 leaders including Rahul Gandhi going to Srinagar without the permission of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir
 That the Congress should have considered this issue before doing so

 The Indian media's interest in the referendum in Britain is furious
 kya bhartiya media bharat main bhi janamat sangrah ke vichaar ko protsaahit karegaa
 Do our political parties also like the referendum, will those parties and organizations demand a referendum that talks about the right to vote in Indian elections for Indians settled abroad
 yahi sawaal un bharatiyon se bhi poocha jaae jo britain main based hai or vahaan ke janamat sangrah main hissaa le rahe hai
 Would they like to demand from Indian leaders that a referendum should be held on their own too
 duniya ke sabase bade or mahaan loktantr main rashtriya yaa rajya ke str par janamat sangrah kyon nahin hota he
 Whereas the system of gram sabhas at the level of panchayats is similar to that of a referendum
 hamane sochaa ki ye queshchan aapke saamne put ap kar dete hai magar ek salaah bhi he
 Talking about the referendum in India, do not mention the place and issue, because the old shirt of those who have done this work has been made worse by throwing ink
 britain ke janamat sangrah ke faisle se bharat se lekar duniya bhar main log un logon kii hansi uda rahe hai jinhone iyu se nikal jane ke paksh main matdaan kiya he
 Many people are saying that this is not the morning we were waiting for
 ham is britain ko nahin jaanate
 This is not the UK where people from different countries used to live
 yahaan adhikari bane, nirvaachit netaa tak bane
 Whose people were tolerant
 unke koi purvaagrah nahin the
 Nobody spoke of hatred
 alag hone vaali jamaat ko islam virdohi, naslbhedi, andh rashtrabhakt or kutarki kaha ja rahaa he
 Somebody is saying that these people have poisoned the politics of Britain forever
 kulamilaakar inhen hikaarat kii nigaah se dekha ja rahaa he
 It is being seen as a crowd that does not have the ability to make informed decisions
 raajnneetik shabdaawalee main is bheed kii dhur dakshinpanthi or kutarki chhavi pesh kii ja rahi he
 Britain has two large parties
 ek conservative party or doosraa lebar party
 Both these parties supported their stay in the EU
 kuch vam netaaon ne party line se alag hokar iyu se alag hone vaali jamaat ke saath matdaan bhi kiya
 Is it right to paint a live Jamaat in a political and ideological color? kya aisa ho saktaa he ki kuch hi hafton main britain kii aadhi se adhik aabaadi achaanak naslbhedi or dakshinpanthi ho jaae
 Of the 650 mps of the UK Parliament, 559 mps are members of the ruling Conservative and opposition Labor Party only
 in donon ne alag na hone kii apil kii thi
 After all, why did not people listen to the 559 mps of the two parties whom they have been listening to for years
 kya isliye logon ne lebar party ko bhi riject kiya kyonki is maamle main lebar or conservative ek se ho gaye the jaise bharat main kai baar bijepi congress kii aarthik nitiyon main koi antar nahin dikhataa
 How did the UK Independence Party, a party with one MP, get so much space instead of two parties of 559 mps? iske netaa nijal paul faraj kaise iyu se alag hone vaali jamaat kii pratinidhi awaz ban jate hai
 Is it because Faraj talks inflammatory and absurd
 faraj ne kaha he ki yah jeet un aam logon kii jeet he jo raajnneeti se tang aa gaye hai
 Politics that does not value the common man
 aap faraj ko bolte sunenge to samaj jaayenge ki bharat main bhi aisa hua he or ho rahata he
 Have leaders like Faraz changed the grammar of speaking of British leaders
 faraj or purv meyar boris johnson jaise netaa raajnneetik tushtikaran ke sawaal uthaate hai, nasl or pravaasiyon par jamkar hamale karte hai
 Faraj told the BBC that people's concerns are justified
 agar koi romanian aapke pados main aakar rahane lage to aap kya karenge
 Faraj has said that if Britain leaves the EU, there will be no attacks on women because people from other European countries will be reduced
 faraj kii baaten bhayanak rup se stri virdohi hai

 Worldwide migration is a challenge
 lekin jo mulk global arthvyavastha or naagarikta ke himachati hai wo kaam ke liye duusare desh se aae logon ko kaise mulk kaa aarthik dushman ghoshit kar sakate hai
 Why don't the leaders of the world speak together? ye ek netaa or ek mulk kii samasya kaise he
 What refugees have created the problem of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan? britain main naukariyon or mazaduri kaa sankat kya sirf sharnaarthiyon, pravaasiyon ke kaaran he
 Then it should be the highest in Germany where most refugia have gone
 britain main janamat sangrah se pehle tamaam badi vittiya sansthaaon or corporat ne apane karmchaariyon ko bhi samajhane ke kaam main lagaaya ki log iyu se alag hone kaa faisla na karen, isse unke aarthik hiton ko nuksaan pahonchega
 There must have been a lot of talk about this aspect in the media as well
 iske baad bhi kyon logon ne alag hone kaa faisla kiya
 a financial center like London went with the EU but with the decision to secede from less large cities and rural areas
 adhik sampann or shahari mazdoor varg iyu ke saath rahane kii jamaat main rahaa to kam sampann or shaharon se dur rahane vaala mazdoor tabaka alag hone vaali jamaat ke saath gaya
 Can all these decisions be included in the frame of right wing
 aam taur par yah samajha jaataa he ki aarthik sankat ke vakt yuva varg andh rashtravaadi, naslbhedi or dakshinpanthi ho jaataa he lekin britain main matdaan karne vaale yuvaaon main se 75 fisadi ne iyu main bane rahane ke paksh main faisla diya he
 His age is 18 to 24 years
 jabaki 50 se 65 saal ke zyaadaatar matadaataaon ne alag hone ke paksh main matdaan kiya jinhen puraane britain ke hisaab se pension kii suvidha he, sarkari naukariyaan hai
 If this discontent has spread due to the crisis of the neoliberal economy, why did the people and media there not ask what other model of economy the Faraj or Johnson leaders have
 jisamen is tarah ke sankat nahin honge
 Everyone will get a job
 kya europe bhar ke dakshinpanthi dalon ke paas nav udaarvaad se alag koi aarthik vichaar he
 Can we try to understand this from the crisis of such an organization like European Union
 britain ne kabhi iyu ko man se sweekaar nahin kiya magar kya yah sahi nahin he ki britain main aadhe se adhik kanoon iyu ke banaae hue hi lagu hai
 Has there been such a big rebellion against all those laws
 germany kii chancelar angela marakel ne britain ke faisle par afsos jataayaa he or kaha he ki iyu ko britain ke saath sambandh banaakar rakhane chahie
 He said that peace and restraint will have to be used in this period of turmoil
 iyu duniya kaa sabase bada aarthik ilaaka he
 Which guarantees safety and durability
 marakel ke anusaar iyu ek unic community he
 Is there a problem in the EU structure? wo europe ke bazaar ko ek to kar sakaa lekin alag alag rashtriya aakankshaon ko nahin saadh sakaa
 What Britain is saying is that the campaign to forge global citizenship on economic grounds may be in trouble
 europea sangh kii raajnneeti par meri pakad kam he phir ham samajhane kaa prayaas karnaa chaahate hai ki kya yah mumkin he ki kisi raashtra se aarthik nitiyaan banane kii shakti nikaal kar kisi sanstha ko de di jaae or raashtra kaa kaam kahin or se banakar aane vaali nitiyon ko lagu karnaa rah jaae, bhale hi wo sabake bhale ke liye banati hon
 If this is the basis, then in which country of the world, policies made by global financial institutions are not being implemented
 agar iyu main khot he to kya yah samajha jaae europea rashtrawaad kaa yah kritrim korporation ab zyada chal nahin saktaa

 in donon dalon ne iyu main bane rahane kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Some left leaders also voted with the Jamaat diverging from the party line
 live jamaat ko ek raajnneetik or vaicharik rang main rangana sahi hoga kya
 Can it happen that within a few weeks more than half of the population of Britain suddenly becomes racist and right-wing
 britain kii sansad ke 650 saansadon main se 559 saansad to sirf sattadhari conrjarvative or vipakshi dal lebar party ke sadsy hai
 Both of them pleaded not to separate
 aakhir logon ne do dalon ke 559 saansadon ko kyon nahin suna jinhen ve varshon se sunate aae hai
 Did people also reject the Labor Party because in this case Labor and Conservatives had become like one, there is no difference in the economic policies of BJP Congress in India many times
 559 saansadon kii do partiyon kii jagah ek saansad vaali party euke independence party ko itnaa spes kaise mil gaya
 How does its leader, Naizal Paul Faraz, become the representative voice of the Jamaat that breaks away from the EU
 kya isliye ki faraj bhadakaau or betuki baaten karte hai
 Faraj has said that this victory is the victory of common people who are fed up with politics
 wo raajnneeti jo aam aadmi kii kadra nahin karti he
 If you hear Faraj speaking, you will understand that this has happened and continues to happen in India too
 kya faraj jaise netaaon ne british netaaon ke bolne kaa vyakaran badal diya he
 Leaders like Faraz and former mayor Boris Johnson raise questions of political appeasement, fiercely attacking race and migrants
 bibisi se faraj ne kaha ki logon kii chintaa jaays he
 What would you do if a Romanian started coming to your neighborhood? faraj ne kaha he ki agar britain iyu se nikal jayega to auraton par hamale nahin honge kyonki duusare europea deshon se aae log kam ho jaaenge
 Faraz's words are horribly anti-women
 kehete hai ki breast feeding kone main karnaa chahie
 Mothers are less profitable for business than men
 aise logon ko vot kaise mil jaataa he or media main kawarej bhi
 Also know their party programs
 - taxi dryver ke liye unifarm anivaary kiya jayega - mps should have more freedom of their expenditure - train ko paaramparik rangon main phir se paint kiya jaae - British football team should not have more than three foreign players
 aisi kutarki baaten bharat main kahi bhi ja rahi hai or ho bhi rahi hai
 On the pretext of some culture, on the pretext of a particular subject, everyone is being asked to do a special kind of drill
 duniya bhar main migration ek chunauti he
 But the countries that are advocates of global economy and citizenship, how can they declare people from other countries for work as economic enemies of the country
 duniya ke netaa milakar bolte kyon nahin he is par
 How is this a problem of a leader and a country
 siria, iraq or afghanistan kii samasya kya sharnaarthiyon ne paidaa kii he
 Is the crisis of jobs and wages in Britain only due to refugees, migrants
 tab to ye germany main sabase adhik hona chahie jahaan sabase adhik rifuji gaye hai
 Prior to the referendum in Britain, many large financial institutions and corporates also tried to convince their employees not to decide to secede from the EU, this would hurt their economic interests
 media main bhi is paksh ko lekar khub baat hui hi hogi
 Even then why did people decide to separate
 landan jaisaa vittiya centre iyu ke saath gaya lekin kam bade shahar or gramin kshetron se log alag hone ke faisle ke saath gaye
 If the more affluent and urban working class lived with the EU, then the less affluent and the workers living away from cities went with the separating group
 kya in sabake faisle ko dakshinpanth ke frem main sameta ja saktaa he
 It is generally understood that during the economic crisis the young class becomes blind nationalist, racist and right-wing, but 75 per cent of the voting youth in Britain have voted in favor of remaining in the EU
 inaki umr 18 se 24 saal he
 While most voters between 50 and 65 years of age voted in favor of separation, which according to old Britain has pension facilities, government jobs are
 navaudaravaadi arthvyavastha ke sankaton ke kaaran agar yah ansatosh failaa he to vahaan ke logon or media ne yah kyon nahin poocha ki faraj yaa johnson netaaon ke paas arthvyavastha kaa koun sa doosraa model he
 In which there will not be such crisis
 sabko naukari milegi
 Do right-wing parties across Europe have any economic ideas different from neo-liberalism
 kya ham ise european union jaise ek aisi sanstha ke sankat se samajhane kaa prayaas kar sakate hai
 Britain has never accepted the EU in its heart, but is it not true that more than half of the laws in Britain are applicable only by the framing of the EU
 kya un tamaam kanoonon ke kilaaf itani badi baghaavat hui he
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed regret over Britain's decision and said that the EU should maintain relations with Britain
 unhone kaha ki uthalputhal ke is daur main shanti or sanyam se kaam lenaa hoga
 The EU is the largest economic region in the world
 jo suraksha or sthayitv kii guarantee detaa he
 According to Merkel, the EU is a unique community
 kahin samasya iyu ke dhaanche main to nahin he
 He could unite the European market but could not fulfill different national aspirations
 britain kaa nikalnaa kya yah kah rahaa he ki aarthik aadhaar par global naagarikta gadhane kaa abhiyaan sankat main pad saktaa he
 My grip on European Union politics is less, then we want to try to understand whether it is possible to take the power to make economic policies from a nation and give it to an institution and that the work of the nation is coming from elsewhere Keep applying, even if they are made for the good of all
 agar yah aadhaar he to duniya ke kis desh main vaishvik vittiya sansthaaon kii banaai gai nitiyaan lagu nahin ho rahi hai
 If there is a flaw in the EU, then should it be understood that this artificial corporation of European nationalism can no longer run
 dhyaan rakhiyegaa iyu ke astitv par pehle bhi sakant aae hai or vah unase niklaa he
 The elite intellectuals are laughing at Britain's decision
 bharat ke buddhijivi hans rahe hai ki loktantr ke naam par bheedtantr ne moorkhtapurna faisla kar liya
 Are we really living in some silly phase where kutarka has become the main argument
 kya puri duniya main kalyug se pehle kurthakayug aa gaya he
 Wouldn't it be ego to say so
 britain ke pradhanmantri david camran ne janamat sangrah ke faisle ko sweekaar kiya he
 They were not in favor of leaving the EU
 tippaniyan After the results, Cameron came with his wife Samantha Cameron and resigned
 bharat ke netaa jab istipha dete hai to ve parivaar ke saath nahin hote
 Surrounded by supporters and tables
 patniyaan to kabhi kabhaar hi dikhti hai
 The wives of our leaders can be seen with the leader at the time of Griha Pravesh or Karva Chauth
 mujhe acha laga ki jab camran istipha de rahe the tab unki patni ek dost kii tarah khadi thim
 Scotland's First Minister has said that Scotland can again hold a referendum on the question of separation from Britain
 isi april main sweden main ek survey hua tha jisamen iyu se alag hone kii baat nakaar di gai thi
 There was also a question in that, what would they do if they left Britain, then the number of people separated from the EU in that survey was high
 bazaar jo alag alag kaarnon se har duusare tisare din girtaa hi rahata he, shuukravaar ko kuch zyada bharbhara gaya
 All currencies began to tremble and there was an uproar in the stock markets up to India
 aisa laga ki britain sirf iyu se nahin, puri duniya se nikal kar chand par chalaa gaya he
 Is there some new kind of buzz about language, culture and nationalism in Europe, which the established and power-ridden politics is unable to say? Has the illusion of everyone getting equal opportunity broken in the current economy? Are the poor now seeing why the rich are getting richer? Can we see this decision of Britain as a mandate against the prevailing economy around the world? Would it be right to see this decision in a right-wing frame? But before that i want to read a statement of the newly elected Mayor of London which came after the decision of referendum
 'main landan main rahane vaale sabhi europea nagarikon ko saaf saaf sandesh dena chahta hum ki aap sabhi kaa yahaan swaagat he
 As a city thank you for all your contributions and that is not going to change because of this referendum

 It is our responsibility to fill the division that has taken place during this entire campaign
 hamen un baton par focus karnaa he jo hamen jodatii he
 Not on what breaks us
 ' Of the 650 mps of the UK Parliament, 559 mps are members of the ruling Conservative and opposition Labor Party only
 in donon ne alag na hone kii apil kii thi
 After all, why did not people listen to the 559 mps of the two parties whom they have been listening to for years
 kya isliye logon ne lebar party ko bhi riject kiya kyonki is maamle main lebar or conservative ek se ho gaye the jaise bharat main kai baar bijepi congress kii aarthik nitiyon main koi antar nahin dikhataa
 How did the UK Independence Party, a party with one MP, get so much space instead of two parties of 559 mps? iske netaa nijal paul faraj kaise iyu se alag hone vaali jamaat kii pratinidhi awaz ban jate hai
 Is it because Faraj talks inflammatory and absurd
 faraj ne kaha he ki yah jeet un aam logon kii jeet he jo raajnneeti se tang aa gaye hai
 Politics that does not value the common man
 aap faraj ko bolte sunenge to samaj jaayenge ki bharat main bhi aisa hua he or ho rahata he
 Have leaders like Faraz changed the grammar of speaking of British leaders
 faraj or purv meyar boris johnson jaise netaa raajnneetik tushtikaran ke sawaal uthaate hai, nasl or pravaasiyon par jamkar hamale karte hai
 Faraj told the BBC that people's concerns are justified
 agar koi romanian aapke pados main aakar rahane lage to aap kya karenge
 Faraj has said that if Britain leaves the EU, there will be no attacks on women because people from other European countries will be reduced
 faraj kii baaten bhayanak rup se stri virdohi hai
 It is said that breast feeding should be done in the corner
 jo maa hoti hai wo mardon kii tulana main bijness ke liye kam phydemand hoti hai
 How do such people get votes and the media coverage too
 inaki party ke kaarykram bhi jaan lijie
 - Uniform will be made compulsory for taxi driver - saansadon ko unke karche kii zyaada azaadi honi chahie - Re-paint the train in traditional colors - british footbal team main teen se zyada videshi khilaadi na hon
 Such malicious things are being said and happening in India

 The new rules of the Lodha Committee have begun to dominate people sitting in cricket associations
 samiti ke pehle shikaar bane the bisisiai ke adhyaksh anuraag thakur
 Now many more office bearers are going to fall for the new rules
 inamen dada ke naam se mashhoor saurabh ganguli bhi shaamil hai
 Committee Secretary Gopal Sankaranarayan on Thursday issued new clarifications regarding the participation of representatives in the BCCI and members of state associations
 lodha samiti ne prashasnic sudhaaron ko lekar puche gaye sawaalon par saat bindu board ke liye anivaary banaate hue spasht kiya ki bisisiai ke barkhaast sachiv ajay shirke bisisiai kii baithkon main maharashtra cricket sangh ke pratinidhi nahin ho sakate
 Regarding Bengal Cricket Association (CAB) president Sourav Ganguly, the committee said that he would have to undergo a three-year mandatory break after June 2017, as he would complete his three years as secretary and president in the state association
 cab ke koshadhyaksh vishwaroop de kaa prashasnic kariyar bhi khatm ho gaya he kyonki vah sahaayak sachiv ke jis pad par do saal ke liye rahe the use padaadhikari kaa pad mana gaya he jisase rajya sangh main unka sanchit kaarykaal 10 saal kaa ho jaataa he
 The most frequently asked question from the Lodha Committee was related to Shirke's admission
 samiti se sawaal kiya gaya ki kya koi ayogy kiya gaya padaadhikari sadsy sangh yaa bisisiai ke pratinidhi yaa namit ke rup main kaam kar saktaa he, kya aisa vyakti sangh yaa bisisiai kii ore se koi anya bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 
 ?tippaniyan To this, the committee said that in view of the order of the Supreme Court, no unqualified official can join the cricket administration
 vah sadsy sangh yaa bisisiai kaa pratinidhi yaa namit hone se bhi disqalifai he or sangh yaa bisisiai kii ore se koi anya bhoomika nahin nibhaa saktaa
 He cannot also play the role of mentor or advisor with the Union and cannot become a member of any committee or council
 samiti ke sachiv gopal shankaranaryan ne guuruuvaar ko bisisiai or rajya sanghon ke sadasyon main pratinidhiyon kii bhagidaari se jude nae spashtikaran jari kiye
 The Lodha committee made it compulsory for the seven-point board to ask questions on administrative reforms, clarifying that BCCI sacked secretary Ajay Shirke cannot be a representative of the Maharashtra Cricket Association in BCCI meetings
 bengal cricket sangh (cab) ke adhyaksh saurav ganguli bare main samiti kaa kahana he ki june 2017 ke baad unhen teen saal ke anivaary brake se guzarana hoga, kyonki rajya sangh main sachiv or adhyaksh ke rup main unke teen saal puure ho jaaenge
 The administrative career of CAB treasurer Vishwaroop Dey has also come to an end as the post of assistant secretary he held for two years has been considered as the post of officer, which makes his accumulated tenure in the state association to be 10 years
 lodha samiti se jo sawaal sabase adhik baar poocha gaya vah shirke ke pravesh se sambandhit tha
 The committee was questioned as to whether any disqualified official could act as a representative or a nominee of the member association or BCCI, whether such person could play any other role on behalf of the association or BCCI
 
 ? Comments is par samiti ne kaha ki ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh ko dekhte hue koi bhi ayogy padaadhikari cricket prashasan se nahin jud saktaa
 He is also disqualified from being a representative or nominee of the member association or BCCI and cannot play any other role on behalf of the union or BCCI
 vah sangh ke saath sangrakshak yaa salaahkaar kii bhoomika bhi nahin nibhaa saktaa or kisi samiti yaa parishad kaa sadsy nahin ban saktaa

 President Bashar al-assad wants people to remember him 10 years from now as the man who saved Syria
 yah baat asad ne ek spanish akhbaar el paris ko die ek saakshaatkaar main kahi he
 Violent civil war has been going on in Syria for almost six years and efforts to end it have a direct connection with Assad's future
 unka kahana he ki vah bahupratikshit sanghasharviraam lagu karne ke liye taiyaar the basharte vidrohi or unke antarrashtriya samarthak turki aadi apana aadhaar banane ke liye iskaa upyog nahin karte

 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Congress President Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra has become a burden for the party
 aarthik saamchaar patr 'da iconomic times' ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he
 The people of Rae Bareli do not forget the spectacular motorcycle rally of Vadra which they took out in 2012
 vidhansabha chunaav main unhone sakriy bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The rally was held in the borders of Rae Bareli and Amethi and was taken cognizance of by the Election Commission as it was attended by 150 cyclists while only 10 were allowed
 vaise vahaan ke logon ko vah raily isliye pasand ai ki usamen rang birangi matorcycilen daudti dikhin
 But Vadra's entry into politics was of no use to the Congress and the party lost seven out of 10 assembly seats in the Rae bareli-amethi region
 wadra ne beshak shanadaar raily kii lekin pichley saal jameen ghotaale main naam aane ke baad se vah vahaan nahin dikhe
 In a way, he became a political burden on the party
 vahaan party ke ek sadsy ne kaha ki vah gale kaa kanta ban gaye hai jise naa niglaa ja saktaa he or naa ugala ja saktaa he
 Vadra has further aggravated the Congress which is facing attacks on many issues
 congress ke ek netaa ne kaha ki haalanki priyanka ji un par lage aaropon kaa joardaar khandan kar rahi hai lekin jameen par kaaryakartaaon ko hi unka bachaav karnaa hoga
 Till now we were engaged in convincing the public about the 2G and Colgate scams that there are less and more things in them
 lekin wadra ke bare main logon ko kya samajhaayen
 Another party member said that it is difficult to refute the bjp's allegation that Vadra made Rs one lakh to Rs 300 crore and that too in a very short time
 usne kaha ki party ko to use bahut pehle hi alag kar dena chahie tha
 The people of Rae Bareli and Amethi have great affection for the Gandhi family but the people there do not have that kind of opinion about Vadra
 zyaadaatar log unke bare main baaten bhi nahin karnaa chaahate
 a senior Congress leader said that Priyanka would never talk about Vadra
 yah pehla mauka he ki unhone unka bachaav kiya he

 This would prove to be his anti-terror
 anyathaa use duniya aatank hitaishi desh kahegaa
 The Home Minister said that in the case of Pathankot attack, if Pakistan does not give India a chance to investigate, it would mean that it cheated India
 use yah pramanit karnaa hoga kii vah aantak kaa himachati nahin he
 'nobody can accuse Lal of Mai', the Home Minister said that the central government will never let the pride and pride of the countrymen come on

 ' The Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have decided to go ahead with their partnership to form an alliance in Uttar Pradesh followed by Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand
 ab donon partiyaan in donon rajyon main bhi loksabhaa chunaav saath-saath ladengi
 On the lines of Uttar Pradesh, the BSP has also won seats in these states
 madhya pradesh ke kul 29 loksabhaa kii siton main se basapa 26 siton par or sapa mahaj 3 siton par ummidavaar utaaregi
 Out of the total 5 Lok Sabha seats in Uttarakhand, the BSP will contest on 4 seats and SP on 1 seat
 donon hi dalon ne in rajyon main loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress se duuri bana lee he
 However, the presence of SP and BSP in these states is symbolic
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main in rajyon main basapa or sapa loksabhaa kii koi bhi seat jeetne main safal nahin ho pai thi
 The total vote share of both these parties is 2 in Madhya Pradesh
 3 fisadi ke aasapaas rahaa he
 Also, the fight in the state is directly between the BJP and the Congress
 gauratlab he ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main madhya pradesh main bhaajapa ko 27 siton par jeet hasil hui thi
 The same Congress had won only 2 seats
 duusari taraf uttarakhand ke sabhi 5 loksabhaa kii siton bhaajapa ne jeet hasil kii thi
 Which party's game will be spoiled by the alliance of these two parties? Actually SP and bsp's votebank is more or less the same as that of Congress
 aise main madhya pradesh main in donon partiyon ke haath milaane se congress kaa chunavi ganit kharaab ho saktaa he
 In the last assembly elections in 2018, Bahujan Samaj Party won two seats and Samajwadi Party one seat in Madhya Pradesh
 vahi vot pratishat kii baat kare to basapa ko 5 fisadi or sapa ko 3
 2 votes were received
 vidhansabha chunaav main donon hi dal alag-alag lade the
 Even with these two parties, the case in Uttar Pradesh may be against the BJP, but in Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand it can also work in favor of the BJP
 vipakshi voton khaskar congress ke vot katane kaa sidhaa phayda bhaajapa ko ho saktaa he

 Pillow talk i
e
 lying on a pillow during the night is very important for a better relationship
 aapako shaayad yakeen na ho lekin ek achche relationships ke liye jitna mahatpurna sex he utana hi is tarah baat karnaa bhi he
 Researchers at the University of Michigan say that the insecurity of women partners begins to go away soon after intimate relationships
 shodhakartaaon kaa kahana he ki sex ke baad mahilaayein atension chaahati hai
 According to this research published in an English newspaper, it is always good to have nice and sweet talks with a partner after sex
 aisa karne se couples ke bich bharosa badhata he
 456 people were researched for this study
 shodh pramukh doctor danniel kragar ke anusaar, shodh main paaya gaya he ki sex ke baad purush jaldi so jate hai
 Doctor Kruger says that women feel inferior in their homes when their partner falls asleep after an intimate relationship
 unhen lagane lagata he ki ve mahatvapurn nahin hai or unamem upekshit hone kaa bhav aa jaataa he
 It has been said in the study that after sex, talking on the bed is as important as sex
 sex sambandh jahaan rishton ko majbootee dene kaa kaam karte hai vahiin sex ke baad kii gai baatcheet rishte main bharosa badhaati he
 An interesting thing has also been said in the research that after sex, men fall asleep too soon because they are afraid that women will demand a commitment from them or try to get them to agree on something else
 vahiin mahilaayein sex ke baad apni bhaawanaaon ko vyakt karne ke liye utsuk rahati hai
 In such a situation, they do not like sleeping at all
 sahitya ajtak ke duusare ahm satr ‘ek chand he sar-e-aasmaan’ main urdu kii tasavvurati duniya main bade naam, kavi, aalochak or lekhak shams ur rahamaan faruki or kavi or lekhak prem kumaar nazar ne shirkat kii
 The session was moderated by Ahmed Mahfouz
 prem kumaar najar ne guftgu kaa aagaaj karte hue kaha ki ek jamaana tha jab dow
 Samuel Johnson was considered a dictator of the English language
 or jab ye baat mujhe yaad aati he to jhat se faruki sahab yaad aa jate hai
 His status is also like a literary dictator
 aaj se 55-60 saal pehle jab inhone tanakid (aalochana) kaa kaam shuru kiya, to us vakt log chaunk gaye, hairaan ho gaye ki ye nayaa shaks koun paidaa ho gaya jo is tarah kii baaten nikaal rahaa he
 So i want to ask this question directly to Farooqui Sahab that at that time you wrote a lot that this old-fashioned tank was no longer of any use
 to aapane kya fark mahasoos kiya, kya kami mahasoos kii or aapane jo likhaa, use aap nayaa kyon samajhate the?is sawaal par shamsurrahman faruki ne sabhi kaa kheramakadam karte hue kaha ki maine bahut dinon ke baad apane dost najar ko dekha
 They said that they have become old, but not so old, as you people are understanding
 inaki tabiyat abhi bahut jawan he
 Farooqui while answering the question said that the criticism of Urdu in front of me so far does not suit me
 meraa usase itmeenaan nahin hota
 The issue is how to separate Ghalib from Mir
 unhone kaha ki mir or gaalib ke bare main jo baaten kii gayi, ve to kisi ke liye bhi kii ja sakati hai
 It is very easy to say such things in criticism
 koi bhi chaar-paanch jumale dhund lijie
 Farooqui said that usually the same words are circulated in criticism to say almost the same things about someone and this criticism has become a business
 faruki ne ek vaakye kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki ek seminar main main tha
 So there was an honor for someone who wanted to read, they read it for someone else
 yani pehle ye tanakid sirf kehane bhar ke liye hota tha
 He said that i was deeply saddened by the way he was tanned at that time
 ye baaten kahkar main khud ko bahut bada urdu kaa jaankaar nahin kah rahaa
 But the things that were done in this way were superficial
 tab kisi ke liye bhi kah diya jaataa tha ki falaan sahab bahut najuk khyaali hai
 Let it be said for two people that they were very famous, so what was the difference between them
 to phir mir ke liye bhi vahi baat kah dijie or gaalib ke liye bhi
 Farooqui said that the things which were present in the literary culture were very clear in the poets or writers and listeners
 wo samaj lete the ki main kya kah rahaa hum or wo kya sun rahe hai
 Then the era changed
 wo rishte kamjor pad gaye
 Then another problem occurred
 aise skool-college khul gaye jisamen sab kuch padhaayaa jane laga
 Urdu and Hindi literature was being taught in our country at a time when English was not even taught at London University
 1880 main jaakar oxford ne angreji kaa course shuru kiya
 Farooqui agreed to tell mir-nazir and Premchand in the same way
 unhone kaha ki ye sabhi alag-alag tarah ke the
 But everyone was told a few changes
 main is tarah kaa fark nahin bayaan kar saktaa
 So i thought i would try writing myself
 hamaare ladakpan ke jamaane main jis tarah kaa hindi or urdu sahitya chal rahaa tha
 That era was also called progressive movement
 mere saamne ek or agenda lekar log aae
 Then i debated a lot
 LIVE: sahitya ajtak 2018- malini avasthi ne bahaai bhakthi kii gangasahityakaron ke jarnalineeshan or moderigeshan ke sawaal par prem kumaar ne faruki se poocha ki kai baar aisa lagata he ki mir ne ye baat na kahi ho phir bhi aapane kah di
 On this, Farooqui said that Mir's lion was also tied
 wo jis sandarbh main sher kehete the, use hi log badal dete the
 For example
 
 
 ameerjaadon ke ladakon se mat mila kar mir,ki ham garib hue hai inhen kii daulat se
 So wealth means people have taken money out of wealth which is wrong
 yahaan daulat kaa matlab badaulat se he yani inaki vajah se
 But it was linked to wealth
 jaafaree sahab ne kaha ki ye garib or amir tabake ke bare main kaha gaya he, jabaki aisa tha nahin
 Farooqui said that one of our maestro removed all the lions who molested girls from Mir's selection
 to jab aap puure mir ko dekh hi nahin rahe hai to kaise unke bare main sahi bataa sakate hai
 Farooqui advised that if you consider the poet to be big, then read it fully
 piyush mishra ne kyon chhod di thi rajshri kii 'maine pyaar kiya'?faruki ne kaha ki koi shaayar likhte samay ye nahin kah saktaa ki ye sher 10 saal main khatm hoga ki 100 saal main yaa phir ye isi mulk main rah jayega yaa duusare mulk main bhi chalaa jayega
 The good of a good poet is that he puts many such things in it, from which many meanings can be derived
 bade shaayar kii ye badi pahchaan hoti he ki wo har jamaane main apane sher ke liye alag myne rakhata he
 He narrates a lion giving an example - where in Mir is born to Kahe

 In connection with this, a Delhi court has said that the cross-examination process is an important tool for obtaining information from witnesses, but 'indecent' and 'blasphemous' questions cannot be asked of the witnesses, because they are misused to torture the witness Can be done for atirikt satr nyaayadhish vinod kumaar ne ek punarikshan yachika par sunwaayee karte hue kaha ki jirah ke dauraan gavaah ko ‘ashobhaneey’ or ‘nindaatmak’ sawaalon se kisi tarah kaa bachaav hasil nahin hoga agar magistrate ke aadesh ko antarim or bina chunauti dene laayak samajha jaae
 The judge said, "if the witness feels tortured and the court is unable to save him from torture then he will have no choice
" isliye kisi gavaah ko ashobhaneey or nindaneey sawaalon yaa aise sawaalon se koi bachaav nahin hasil hoga, jinka lakshya uskaa apmaan karnaa yaa use chidhaane kaa ho yaa apraasangik sawaalon kaa uddeshy use pratadit karnaa or mukademe main deree karne kaa ho'

 As far as the dignity of the language is concerned, the Ministry of External Affairs has not done much work in Hindi till now
 " Tharoor, who had worked in the United Nations and was ranked second in the 2006 election for the post of UN secretary-general, questioned the promotion of Hindi and said that Hindi is not even the national language of India
 unhone kaha, "hindi rashtriya bhashaa nahin he, yah aadhikarik bhashaa he
 An important question arises on advancing Hindi
 hamen sanyukt raashtra main adhikarik bhashaa kii kya jarurat he? arabi, hindi se zyada nahin boli jaati he, lekin yah 22 deshon main boli jaati he
 Hindi is used as the official language of only one country (our country)
 " Tharoor said, "the question is what will be gained from this
 agar isaki jarurat he to hamaare paas pradhanmantri yaa videsh mantri hai, jo hindi main bolnaa pasand karte hai, ve aisa karte hai or unke bhaashan ko anuwaad karne ke liye raashi adaa kar sakate hai
 In future, it may be that the future Prime Minister or Foreign Minister is from Tamil Nadu
 " unhone kaha, "sarkaar ko apni sthiti spasht kerani he
 i can understand the pride of the people of Hindi speaking area, but the people of this country who do not speak Hindi also feel proud to be Indian
 " VIDEO - Prime Minister Narendra Modi fiercely praised Congress MP Shashi Tharoor tharur ke bayaan par satta paksh ne virodh kiya
 Commenting on Tharoor's statement, Sushma Swaraj said, "indian diaspora is also spoken by Hindi in many countries

 sushamaa swaraj ne is baat kii ore ishaara kiya ki unhone or pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi sanyukt raashtra main hindi main bhaashan diya tha
 Swaraj said, "when foreign guests come to us, and if they speak in English, we also speak in English

 As far as the dignity of the language is concerned, the Ministry of External Affairs has not done much work in Hindi till now

 unhone kaha, "hindi rashtriya bhashaa nahin he, yah aadhikarik bhashaa he
 An important question arises on advancing Hindi
 hamen sanyukt raashtra main adhikarik bhashaa kii kya jarurat he? arabi, hindi se zyada nahin boli jaati he, lekin yah 22 deshon main boli jaati he
 Hindi is used as the official language of only one country (our country)
 " Tharoor said, "the question is what will be gained from this
 agar isaki jarurat he to hamaare paas pradhanmantri yaa videsh mantri hai, jo hindi main bolnaa pasand karte hai, ve aisa karte hai or unke bhaashan ko anuwaad karne ke liye raashi adaa kar sakate hai

 Input from IANS ieenes se input On the one hand, the Lok Sabha election campaign is gaining momentum, on the other hand the Electoral Code of Conduct is being severely violated
 chunavi aachaar samhita ke ulanghan ko dekhte hue chunaav ayog par nishpaksh tareeke se chunaav karaane kii badi jimmedaari he, lekin is bich desh main swatantra or nishpaksh chunaav ke saath hi aachaar samhita ke paalan ke prati chunaav ayog kii bhoomika ko lekar purv naukarshahon ne gahari chintaa jataai or iske liye unhone raashtrapati ramnath kovind ko khat bhi likhaa he
 66 former bureaucrats have kept the role of the Election Commission in abeyance for following the code of conduct applicable in the country
 chunaav ayog kii shikaayat karte hue naukarshahon ne apane patr main 'oparation shakti' ke dauraan anti satellite missile ke safal pareekshan ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ke raashtra ke naam sambodhan, narendra modi par bani byopic film, web siries or bijepi ke kai netaaon ke aapattijanak bhaashanon kaa zikr bhi kiya gaya he
 In spite of the complaint made to the Election Commission, only a show of action was taken
 rutabe kaa durupyograshtrapati kovind ko patr likhane waalon main purv videsh sachiv shivashankar menon, dilli ke purv uparajyapal najeeb jang, punjab ke purv dijipi julio ribero, prasar bharti ke purv siio jawahar sarkaar or tri ke purv chairman rajeev khullar jaise purv naukarshah shaamil hai
 The letter written by the bureaucrats states that the ruling party and the central government are flouting the code of conduct by arbitrarily misusing their status
 unke aise manamaane kaamkaaj se saaf he ki chunaav ayog ke prati bhi unke man main koi sammaan nahin he
 Prior to writing a letter to President Ramnath Kovind, former bureaucrats had also written to the Election Commission to stop the violation of the code of conduct
 is patr main unhone modi byopic film samet kai anya samagriyon par apni gahari chintaaen jataai thi
 Now the same complaint letter has also been written to President Ramnath Kovind

 The young narrator Indira Dangi possesses competent, rich and sensitive language
 kisi bhi sthiti ko ve bahut vaastaviktaa ke saath rachane kii kshamta rakhti hai
 Many of his stories have become credible and powerful in spite of their seemingly impossible ends
 pichley dinon aayaa unka pehla upanyaas 'rapatile raste' unki is kshamta kaa nae sire se pramaan sulabh karaata he
 The novel's narrative revolves around a Dalit young writer who somehow wants to build his national identity
 ek chote se kasbe kaa yah lekhak ummid karata he ki uske guru is kaam main uski madad karenge
 He also seems to have achieved some steps of success, but he finds that he is stuck somewhere in his slips
 prasiddhi kii pratisparddha main uski hode un yuva lekhikaon se he jo bade sampadakon, aalochakon or guruon ke sampark ke sahare jaldi se jaldi shoharat ke shikhar par pahunchnaa chaahati hai
 Needless to say that this can be an interesting novel for those interested in the inner ups and downs of Hindi literature - also because the author has included many well-known controversies of contemporary Hindi literature
 upanyaas se guzarate hue kisi ko 'hans', 'nayaa gyanoday' or 'paakhi' se jud kuch charchaaon kii yaad aae to hairaani kii baat nahin
 The novel's narrative moves at a fast pace — almost like the protagonist's early development
 upanyaas padhate hue hindi sahitya ke vaastavik dwandv bhale na samaj main aaen, lekin yah samaj main aata he ki dilli yaa sahitya ke kendron se dur baithi jamaat sahitya ke khel ko kis tarah dekhati he
 In the novel, an elderly professor and critic tries to rape a young poet, a journalist writes and publishes interviews of authors
 buzurg lekhak or aalochak kavyitriyon kii rachana sudhaarte nazar aate hai
 Along with all this, the politics of poetic seminars, conferences, publications and awards is also stapled
 patrikaon ke visheshank nijee maitriyon ke aadhaar par nikaale ja rahe hai, lekhakon kii haisiyat nijee sambandhon ke aadhaar par tay kii ja rahi he, sharaab or paisa jaise sahitya main bah rahe hai
 But is this really the truth? The writer of Hindi is otherwise a fat creature
 vah naukari karke guzaaraa karata he or bache-khuche samay main likhata he
 Of course, in recent years, the money that has come in the professorship and bureaucracy has changed his living conditions, but still the sky of his ambitions is small
 kuch kaarobaari qism ke kavi sammelnon or kuch sarkari madad se chalane vaale aayojanon ko chhod den to panchasitara samskruti hindi sahitya ke centre main kya, haashie par bhi nahin he
 But this does not mean that it is a sattvic or milk washed society
 pichley kai varshon se lagaataar likh raheen indira dangi ko agar yah mahasoos hota he ki aalochakon or sampadakon kii duniya apni saahitiyik kasautiyaan tay karne ke liye kuch asaahitiyik qism kii pravritiyon kii bhi madad leti he yaa stri yaa sharaab ke prati atirikt udaar dikhti he to jaahir he, yah unke dekhe-sune anubhav kaa hissaa hoga
 Of course, it may have exaggerations, but in the literary world of Hindi, it is becoming common to complain that criticism is now subsisting on friendship relations
 yaa agar yah sach na bhi ho to dilli ke duurastha kendron main hindi sahitya kii ban rahi yah chhavi lekhakon-sampadakon or aalochakon ke liye chintaa kaa vishay honi chahie
 This image states that the skepticism of the literary fraternity has increased

 The hero comes from his village to a big city - gets a journalism job, but eventually stumbles from here and returns to his home
 apni nijee or lekhkeey pahchaan ke bich kaa antardvandv lagaataar uske bheetar he
 He wants to get into literature by hiding his surname
 jis dalit ladki se prem karata he
 Marries her
 lekin ek din phir sahitya main paanv jamaane kii tamanna main sab kuch chhodkar nikal padataa he
 This time he is in Delhi
 yahaan aakar vah paata he ki raajnneeti bhi badi ho gai he, apmaan bhi baarik ho gaye hai
 And finally he understands that if he survives or becomes, then only by his writing
 yah ek sarthak ant he
 However, before reaching this end, the story is also stray
 charitron ke vikaas or ghatnaon ke vistaar main kahin-kahin hadabadi nazar aati he
 Many of the reactions of the novel's hero, Virat, do not create credibility
 isi tarah kuch bahut samvedansheel drishyon kaa chithran kamazor pad jaataa he
 For example, seeing his mentor bullying a young poetess, the hero-disciple's response comes in a whole sentence - 'are you raping Guruji?' And instead of shame or remorse, a villainous attitude appears within Guruji
 guru or shishy donon yahaan filmi dikhte hai or donon kii pratikriyaayein baad main bilkul bejaan maaloom padati hai
 The question is, why does this happen? Why does a skilled narrator like Indira Dangi suddenly seem to miss here? Probably because the sensation of which she is sitting to write the story itself falls under her arrest
 upanyaas main ghatnaon ke byore jas ke tas daalane kii chahat use kamazor karti he
 The truth is that this is the big question of our time - how can a Dalit writer make his place in the otherwise confined world of Hindi? Or why this kind of mediocrity is dominated in Hindi writing and criticism
 hindi main likhane kii apni traasad parinatiyaan lekhak ke pathakavihin or becheharaa rah jane se shuru hokar prakaashan or puraskaar ke gathjod tak pahunchati hai jo antat: lekhan ko bhi kshatigrast karti hai
 The continuing squabble in his name is an important issue amidst the ever increasing inevitability of Dalit and female discourse
 magar lekhika is gaharaai tak utarane kaa dhiraj nahin dikhaati
 She is limited to the details above
 kahin-kahin kuch laaparvaah si tippaniyan chali aati hai
 For example, Mannu Bhandari married Rajendra Yadav in his wish for fame - this propaganda is both shocking and sad

 The comments 'craft' indira dangi kaa priy shabd lagata he, jiskaa ve kai arthon main istemaal karti hai
 But the 'craft' of the novel breaks
 apni simaaon kii vajah se 'rapatile rajpath' ek mahatvapurn upanyaas banate-banate rah jaataa he
 It becomes an ongoing novel written with the desire to become popular
 beshak, lekhika ke paas kissagoi kii jo kshamta he, vah use rapatane se bachaa leti he
 The intervening passages are good and sensitive, but the novel does not leave a big impact in its entirety

 He wants to get into literature by hiding his surname

 For example, seeing his mentor bullying a young poetess, the hero-disciple's response comes in a whole sentence - 'are you raping Guruji?' And instead of shame or remorse, a villainous attitude appears within Guruji

 wo yah ki reerest of da rer maamalon main bhi naaballig apradhi ko zyada se zyada sajaa keval 3 saal hi kyon?video:hamen manjuur nahin yah faislisi sawaal ko ajtak ne jaankaron ke saamne uthaaya
 It turned out that no matter how heinous the crime is, the maximum punishment for a juvenile can be only 3 years
 yah bhartiya kanoon kii baadhyataa he
 Not only this, this punishment has been given in view of the provisions of United Nations
 zyaadaatar deshon main isi niyam ko follow kiya jaataa he
 Laws need to be amended: KTS Tulsi, a well-known lawyer of KTS tulsisupreme Court, said that the maximum punishment in child crime cases is three years
 aparaadh chaahe kaisaa bhi ho, aise maamalon main kanoon aparaadh kaa vargeekaran nahin karata
 Tulsi said that if the age is less than one minute below 18 years, then the offender gets benefits under the provisions

 Tulsi says that Juvenile laws now need to be amended
 sansad ko chahie ki kanoon main sansodhan kare or naaballig kii umr 18 se ghataakar 16 kar de
 He argued that the juvenile crime figures in the last 5 years have been quite shocking
 16 se 18 kii umr main aparaadh (murder, rape or anya) karne waalon kii sankhya main 43 pratishat kii badhotaree hui he
 Child crime has increased much faster in cases such as murder and rape
 in bal aparaadhiyon kii umr 16 se 18 saal ke bich he

 bal aparaadh kii adhiktam sajaa badhaai jaae: mahesh jethmalaniek anya varisht vakil mahesh jethmalani ne kaha ki dilli gangrape ke maamle main faisla praavdhaanon ke anusaar hua he
 But now the time has come to change the law
 sabhi tarah ke juvenil aparaadhon main adhiktam sajaa, jo abhi tak 3 saal he, ko badhaayaa janaa chahie
 Read what happened on the black night of 16 December
 
 
 
 'need to change society's policy and intentions' Colin Gonsalves, another Supreme Court lawyer and human rights activist, said the law was right in its place
 bal aparaadhon main ijaphe kii vajah samaaj or sarkaar bhi hai
 Instead of increasing punishment, there is a need to change the policy and policy of the society
 police kii maane to sthiti khatarnaak hepulice adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki bharat main juvenil kanoon kaa laabh uthaakar bahut se sangathit aparaadh ho rahe hai
 There are many gangs who commit crimes against children between the ages of 16 and 18 years
 iske badale bacchon ko paisa diya jaataa he
 These children get the benefit of the law and they are released early
 yadi vaisaa hi aparaadh koi balig kare to use umrakaid tak kii sajaa sambhav he
 The police can be sure of this because in the last few years, cases of child crime have started to be much higher than before
 kaha ja saktaa he ki aparaadh karne ke taur-tareeke badal gaye hai to ab kanoon ko badalane kii bhi bahut jarurat he
 '16 December' sorrow will never be away from us

 bhale hi ab vah hamaare bich nahin hai, lekin apni khalnaayaki or raubadaar andaaj ke liye vah aaj bhi lokapriy hai
 He captivated audiences with his strong acting from the 1940s to the 1990s

 Pran had no plans to appear in films
 hua yun ki ek baar lekhak mohammad vali ne praan ko ek paan kii dukaan par khadey dekha, us samay vah punjabi film 'yamala jet' ke nirmaan kii yojana bana rahe the
 At the first sight, Vali decided that he would take Pran in his film
 phir kya tha, unhone praan ko film ke liye raji kar liya
 The film 'yamla Jat' was released in 1940 and was a big hit and after that Pran never looked back again

 aapke watsape par sarkari paharaa lag saktaa he
 It is very possible that you cannot delete whatsapp chat as per your wish
 darasal, sarkaar ne ek niti taiyaar kii he
 National Encryption Policy
 iske tahat aap 90 din tak watsape yaa duusari encripted miseging sarvice kii chat delit nahin kar paaenge
 You will have to save it for 90 days
 desh main pichley saal tak 7 karod se zyada watsape yujar the
 Apart from whatsapp, Google Hangouts and Apple's imessage also come under its purview
 soochna praudyogiki mantralay ne yah policy taiyaar kii he
 Till 16 October, suggestions have been sought from the common people
 jaaniye isaki 10 khaas baaten
 1
 bharat yaa bharat se baahar ke sarvice prowider, jo bharat main encripshan technology kaa istemaal kar rahe hai, unke liye sarkaar se yah samjhauta karnaa anivaary hoga
 2
 watsape par kai 'strictali anofitial' group bhi chal rahe hai
 This policy of saving for 90 days will also apply to all such non-official or private messages
 3
 This policy applies in its current form and if whatsapp, Google or imassage do not make this agreement, they can be made illegal or illegal
 4
 If you delete the encrypted message before 90 days, then it will be considered illegal
 kisi sarkari agency ke maangane par aapako plane text dikhaanaa hoga
 5
 bijness main bhi encripted massej or apane saare communication kii plane text seve rakhane honge
 On request, you have to share your encryption password with the government
 6
 The government will decide what encryption product to use
 yani yadi aapke pasandida ap ne doosraa encripshan istemaal kiya to vah avaidh ho jayega
 7
 har ap ko iske liye bani sarkari agency main registration or apane encripshan software yaa hardware kii varking copy agency main jamaa karana anivaary hoga
 8
 2010 main bhi sarkaar ne kaha tha ki vah BBM (blueberi massenger sarvice) ko bharat main bain kar degi
 Then he too had to make a similar agreement with the government
 9
 Experts are calling this policy dangerous, as it will make hackers' access to encrypted messages easier and people will have to face trouble
 10
 Most users do not know when their plain text is converted to encrypted message and they start using it
 kya hota he encripshanenkripshan ek tarah kaa taala he, jiske bheetar aapkaa data sabase zyada surakshit rahata he
 You can read an encrypted file only if you have its password
 us password ke se yah dicript hokar plane text main badalata he
 Smart cards, SIM cards all use encryption
 ab is baat main bahut andeh nahin ho saktaa ki indira gandhi ke baad narendra modi hamaari sabase taqatvar rajnatik shakhsiyat hai
 Going a little deeper, we can say that he is the most domineering and impulsive leader ever
 margrat thatcher ke sandarbh main aavegpurn netaa kii paribhaasha ek aise netaa kii thi jo apni hi dharna se chalata he or aam raay se jise koi lenaa-dena nahin hota
 Apart from this, Modi is also our best speaker
 aap sansad main unke kam bolne yaa sawaalon ke jawaab sidhe na dene ko lekar beshak shikaayat kar sakate hai, lekin ek aise vaataavaran main ve behad vaachaal ho jate hai jo unke puure niyantran main ho
 Once he chooses his audience, he makes such an argument with his speech that we have not seen this country till date
 vaajapeyi mahaan vaktaa the, lekin ve hameshaa aise nahin hote the
 He never used any big platform to propagate his ideas or ideology
 pichley hafte ke dauraan modi ne aise gunon ke prati hamen do baar aashwast kiya haih pehla swatantraaa diwas kesambodhan main or duusari bardubai ke pravasi bhartiya samudaay ke bijpane bhaashan main
 His speech from the Red Fort in Delhi was deliberately not given much consideration
 ise sunakar aisa laga, jaise ki lambii duuri tay karne vaala koi chaalak apni gaadi ko sanbhaalane kii koshish kar rahaa ho
 This time no new recipe was thrown out, perhaps because no significant progress has been seen in the earlier prescriptions, especially in the case of toilets, Swachh Bharat and Make in India
 iske baavjood unhone oropi ke maamle main koi elaan karne kii hadabadi nahin dikhaai, yah tathy apane aap main unki tikshn buddhi kaa sanket he
 Powerful leaders do not set their policies on the basis of events and impulsive leaders do not follow the expectations of others
 isaki bajaae, ve aapako chaunkaate hai
 Modi kept most of the media in awe by talking in a general and nonsensical manner while keeping quiet on OROP, especially the TV channels that had their cameras on Jantar Mantar that day
 taqatvar or aavegpurn netaa dusron ko apana manch chhinane kaa mauka nahin dete
 If Modi had actually made a dramatic announcement on the OROP, if the former military had been satisfied with it, then all the glow of Independence Day would have been snatched away from Modi
 vaise bhi, kisi bade maukey ko kisi ke shikaayat nibatare kaa manch banane kaa kya matlab he?isi tarah dubai main, yah jaanate hue ki ek islamic desh kii unki yah pehali yatra thi jiske saath bharat kaa rishta ajeeb rahaa he-bharat ke kar choron or taskar girohon ke liye dubai jananath rahaa he or khaskar daaud ibrahim kii to yah karmbhumi hi rahaa he-unhone puure rob-daab or majbootee se apana sandesh logon tak pahunchaaya
 He made no complaint about Pakistan's support for terrorism there, did not make any appeal to its patrons, the Sheikhs of Dubai, nor pressured them to change their ways
 bas ek maheen sandesh de diyah dakshin asia bhi europe kii tarah ekajute ho rahaa he, purab ke desh ek saath aa rahe hai, aise main pakistan ne koi adnga lagaaya to bharat uski parvaah kiye bagaiyr chalaang markar yuai tak pahunch jayega
 In such a situation, you join this goal or get isolated
