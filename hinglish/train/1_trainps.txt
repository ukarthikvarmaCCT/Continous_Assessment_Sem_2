 Director Rajkumar Hirani will bring it to the big screen
 raju hiraani ne is film kii kahani par kaam karnaa or script likhnaa shuru bhi kar diya he
 Talking to us Raju Hirani said that after working with Sanjay Dutt i used to think that i know Sanju very well, but it was not so
 hiraani ne kaha, pichhali baar sanjay dutt jab parole par jail se baahar aae the, tab unase mulaakaat ke samay sanjay dutt ne apane bare main itnaa kuch bataaya ki mujhe ehsaas hua ki main sanju ke bare main 10 fisadi bhi nahin jaanata
 Then i thought that the life of Sajjay Dutt should be put on screen
 raju ne kaha ki sanjay dutt kii jindagi ke kai saare aise pahalu hai, jinhen film kaa shakl diya janaa chahie
 In Sanju's life, there are many things related to drugs, allegations of connecting with the underworld, his personal relationship
 raju ne kaha ki sanjay kii jindagi kii kahani kaaphi dilachasp he
 The special thing is that Ranbir Kapoor will play the role of Sanjay Dutt and Ranbir Kapoor has also agreed to play this role
 raju hiraani ke mutabik abhi kagaji agreement nahin hua he, magar ranbir, sanjay dutt ke role ko nibhaane ke liye utsahit or taiyaar hai
 Raju informed that Sanjay Dutt has also approved to make a film on his life
 raju hiraani ne sanjay dutt ke kirdaar ke liye ranbir kapur ke chayan par baat karte hue bataaya ki pehali film 'rocky' ke samay ke sanjay dutt ko agar dekhen, to ranbir kapur bilkul feet or vaise hi dikhte hai
 It is worth noting that Sanjay Dutt was the hero in Raju Hirani's first film Munna Bhai mbbis
 inaki dosti or gahari hui or munna bhai kaa sikval bana or yahaan bhi raju, sanjay saath the
 Sanjay Dutt is currently in jail, but before going to jail, Sanju Baba had completed a guest appearance in Raju Hirani's film 'PK'
 jaahir he ki raju hiraani na sirf achche nirdeshak hai, balki sanjay dutt ke achche dost bhi
 In such a situation, who would be better than Raju Hirani to make a film on Sanjay Dutt's life? Hopefully, viewers will get to see some other aspects of Sanjay Dutt's life that may not have been seen or heard before

 com / idthvtr6yfa post shared by Irrfan (@irrfan) on Mar 19, 2018 at 1:27pm PDT May be the voters of West Delhi Lok Sabha seat get confused while voting this time
 vajah yahaan se ek hi naam ke teen-teen pratyaashiyon kaa hona
 And that name is Jarnail Singh
 ek jaranel singh aam aadmi party ke pratyaashee hai to anya do jaranel aise nirdaleey pratyaashee hai jinhen naa to unki colony ke log jaanate hai or na hi ve chunaav prachaar karte dikh rahe hai
 In such a situation, mystery has arisen regarding these names
 anya donon jaranel singh naa to apane gharon main hote hai or naa hi chunaav prachaar ke liye ilaake main, aise main inako lekar ek tarah kaa rahasy bana hua he ki aakhir hai koun ye jaranel singh, kyonki aapako jaankaar aashcharya hoga ki kai baar in donon jaranel singh (ek se sidhi baat hui jabaki duusare ne jo number nomination main daalaa he wo galat bataata he or doosraa number unke dost kaa he jo baar baar vyast hone kii baat kehete rahe) se baat kii gayi to inkaa jawaab hota chunaav main vyast hai lekin ye kahin bhi ilaake main nahin dikhe
 Not only this, the people of his locality do not even know about his standing in the election
 jaranel singh, jo didie colony, chaukhandi, tilak nagar ke rahane vaale handidie colony, chaukhandi ke rahane vaale harsharan singh ne kaha, 'aam aadmi party vaale jaranel ko janata hum, lekin mere pados main jo jaranel hai main unhen nahin janata
 The candidate should be such that people know and that people should know
 jaranel singh jo emvies nagar, tilak nagar ke rahane vaale hai
 Gagandeep of MVS Nagar said, 'you know Jarnail'
 yahaan se or koi jaranel hai yaa nahin, ye to nahin jaanate
 Neither have i ever seen myself preaching
 kuch logon kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki ye kisi raajnneetik dal kii sajeesh ho sakati he
 This may cause losses to the Aam Aadmi Party
 ilaake main aam aadmi party ke bhi do janrail singh ko lekar asamanjasshetra ke logon main yah bhram ban rahaa he ki vidhayak jaranel singh ko hi aap ne loksabhaa ummidavaar banaaya he
 While the MLA Jarnail Singh is not actually contesting the Lok Sabha elections
 balki loksabhaa chunaav main aap ummidavaar purv patrkaar jaranel singh hai, jo pi chidambaram par juuta phenk kar charchaa aae the
 AAP MLA Jarnail Singh may have to bear the brunt of this confusion in the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki aam aadmi party ke kaaryakarta logon ke bich is asamanjas ko dur karne kii koshish kar rahe hai

 desh main 3,78,118 varg kilometre jangalon main kaam kar rahe 44, 000 van karmiyon ko 2,226 baaghon ke saboot mili hai
 The tiger, which is on the verge of extinction, has made a remarkable comeback in the history of wildlife conservation

 According to Prerna Singh Bindra, a member of the National Wildlife Board and a trustee of an institution called tigers, where small villages are located at the mouth of tiger-densely populated forests, there is little fear of infiltration into each other's territory
 Blood and blood becomes the reason

 According to the Indian Forest Survey, Uttar Pradesh has lost about 2 square kilometers of forest area in the last two years
 isamen bhi bijanour ne sabase zyada khoyaa he—2003 main vahaan 12 fisadi van kshetra tha jo ab kam hokar nau fisadi se bhi neeche aa gaya he
 In such a situation, it is not surprising that the forests of Bijnor are under the most pressure

 vahiin, antarrashtriya shramik sangh (ILO) ne haal hi main anumaan jaahir kiya he ki 2019 tak bharat main rojgaar kii sthiti dayaneey hogi or 15 se 25 saal ke jitne yuvaaon ko rojgaar milegaa, usase teen guna yuva berozegaar hi rah jaaenge
 Let us know how the government is playing with employment statistics
 aankadon kii baazeegari shamilipiefo or enpies ke aankadon main kaha gaya he ki beete chah maheenon main ipieo ke 18
 5 lakh accounts open and 3 of NPS
 5 lakh khate khule or donon ko jodakar nae rojgaar ke aankadon ke taur par pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 If the same employed person has an account with EPFO and NPS, then there is a danger of assuming two jobs based on his two accounts
 chunki kisi bhi karmchaaree kaa iskar uske santhaan main hi kaata jaataa he or kai sansthaanon main sitambar se farvari ke bich nae vittiya varsh ke nivesh kii ghoshnaa kerani hoti he
 Therefore, to save tax, accounts are opened in NPS during this period
 iske alaava enpies main 18 saal se lekar 60 saal tak kii umr kaa bharat kaa nivasee yaa enarai bhi khaataa khol saktaa he
 Hence NPS account does not mean new employment
 ek hi naukareepesha ke kai khatejankaree ke mutabik in aankadon main ek saal se niskriy pade acounts ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 However, even this is not expected to yield fully reliable figures
 isaki vajah yah he ki sitambar se farvari ke bich jin logon ne naukariyaan badali hongi, unke paas ipiefo ke ek se zyada khate honge
 Despite leaving the job, you get good interest for three years on the amount kept in the EPFO account
 isaki vajah se teen saal tak is paise ko nahin nikaala jaataa he
 In such a situation, there is every possibility of duplication mistake in the data being presented
 in aankadon ko bharosemand tabhi mana ja saktaa he jab naukari badalane par bhi ipiefo khaataa purana vaala hi rahe yaa yah anivaary taur par sunishchit kiya ja sake ki desh main ek shaks kaa ek hi ipiefo khaataa hoga
 Demonetisation and GST support a major portion (about 80 per cent) of the economy and employment in India from the unorganized sector
 dilli, mumbai, bengalooru, chennai jaise kuch shaharon ko chhod den to yahaan kii rihaaish or rojgaar ke tareeke ab bhi bade shaharon se dur or asangathit kshetra main hi hai
 Unorganized sector employees and entrepreneurs (including their workers) have come into the organized sector after demonetisation in the Indian economy in November last year and subsequent GST implementation
 is vajah se ab tak asangathit kshetra main rahe rojgaar sangathit kshetra main sthanantarit rahe hai or unhen rojgaar srijan kii shrenee main rakhana sahi nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 The survey technique is not reliable
 In this game of statistics, a question is also being raised how far the data recorded in other services including EPFO and NPS is far from the ground reality
 ipiefo main darj hone ke liye kisi santhaan ke paas kam se kam 20 kamarchaari hone chahie
 Apart from this , only when the salary of an employee is more than 15 thousand rupees per month, it is recorded in EPFO service
 kai companiyaan kam avadhi ke liye rojgaar muhaiyaa karaati hai yani teen maheene yaa chah maheene ke theke par samaybaddh kaam diya jaataa he
 No technology has been adopted to isolate these people registered in EPFO service
 aise main in sabhi ko nayaa rojgaar maan lenaa bhi aankadon ko badha-chadhaakar pesh karne vaala mana jayega
 Now we have to wait
 In this way, the accounts of the unorganized sector from the unorganized sector to the organized sector after short term employment and economic reforms are also being introduced as new jobs
 inaki asaliyat jaanane ke liye philhal kuch samay intjaar karnaa thik rahegaa
 Since the NPS and EPFO figures are now in the public sector, the next few quarters or half-yearly analysis of demonetisation will have to be done in turn
 yahi nahin, notebandi se pehle ke rojgaar ke aankadon kaa adhyayan bhi nai chijen saamne laa saktaa he
 Only after all this can the real face of employment in India be revealed
 kya yah sarkaar kii chaal hestate baint of india ke group chif iconomik adwiser saumy kanti ghosh or iaiti bangalore main professor pulak ghosh ne is saal bajet aane se pehle bhi ipiefo or enpies ke aankadon ko lekar 33 pannon kii ek report jari kii thi
 It was estimated to provide 70 lakh jobs in 2017-18
 tab tak ipiefo or enpies ke aankade public domen main nahin the or in donon arthshaastriyon ke use hasil karne par sawaal bhi khadey hue the
 Now these figures have come in the public domain
 aapako yaad dilaa den ki piem narendra modi ne 2014 ke aam chunaavon se pehle har saal 1 karod rojgaar dene kaa vaada kiya tha, jo beete chaar saalon main se ek baar bhi puraa hota nahin dikhaa he
 With the help of leaked data, the report shows 70 lakh in the organized sector and 80 lakh in the unorganized sector i
e
 1 every year
 5 karod rojgaar srijan kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya tha
 That is, the government was helped a lot by this report
 report ke baad saamne aae the modiapake liye jaananaa mjedaar hoga ki bharat kii paanch guna badi arthvyavastha vaale desh china main bhi har saal 1
 5 crore jobs are not created
 donon ghosh kii madadgaar report saamne aane ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi kuch tivi intervyuu main najar aae the
 Earlier Modi was criticized for keeping distance from media questions
 report saamne aane ke baad modi ne rojgaar ke sawaal par aspasht taur par kaha tha ki asangathit kshetra main paidaa hue rojgaar ko bhi unki sarkaar kii uplabdhi mana jaae
 For this, he gave the example of employing roadside pakoras sellers
 sarkaar karegi in aankadon kaa istemaalaipiefo or enpies ke aankade aise samay main saamne aae hai, jab karnataka ke baad madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh main ahm chunaav hone hai
 BJP in Karnataka is trying to replace Congress and come to power
 rajasthan, chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh main bijepi ko aantarik khemebaaji ke alaava anti inkamabency factor kaa bhi saamana karnaa he
 Apart from this, Lok Sabha elections are to be held in 2019, which the government can get done sometime in advance
 aise main centre sarkaar in aankadon ko rojgaar ke taur par pesh karke apni uplabdhi gina sakati he
 a truck full of bees overturned on NH-65 in Churu, Rajasthan
 iske baad jo hua vah samajha ja saktaa he
 Only bees for one kilometer on the highway
 yani logon ke sir par khatra mandaraata rahaa
 There is chaos everywhere
 20 log ghayal ho gaye
 He had to be hospitalized
 DSP, SHO, SDM sab pahunche maukey parasadak par madhumakhiyaan dekh log bike chhod-chhodkar bhaag nikle
 Quickly, top officers arrived at the scene
 esadm, tehseeldaar, dipti espi, do-do thanon ke esechao sab jamaa ho gaye
 Eventually, the road was blocked from both sides
 lekin madhumakhiyaan ab bhi mandara rahi hai
 The event is on Friday evening
 ab shant hone kaa intjarpulice jesibi kii sahaayta se trek ko to khadaa karne main kaamyaab ho gai, lekin 12 ghante baad bhi madhumakhiyaan shant nahin hui hai or mandara rahi hai
 Officers and policemen present on the spot are also waiting to cool down by closing the glass of the vehicle so that they can sit in their coaches
 punjab number kaa tha trekajankaree ke anusaar punjab number kaa ek trek jaipur se churu kii taraf ja rahaa tha
 Bees were being taken for breeding
 ratananagar se nikalne ke thodi der baad trek asantulit hokar palat gaya
 This broke the boxes and bees came out of them
 jharkhand sarkaar ke sabhi primary skulon main mid de mile ko gas chuulhe par banane kii yojana ab tak dharaatal par saakaar nahin ho pai he
 Because of which more than 70 percent of the primary and upper primary schools of Jharkhand are forced to bear the smoke
 darasal, rajya sarkaar nemid de mileke liye skulon ko alpiji silendar or chulhaa dene kii yojana to banaai thi lekin vittiya niyam ke pench main yah shuru tak nahin ho saki
 In view of the problem of smog in young children in Jharkhand, the state government had planned to allocate gas stove and gas cylinder to more than 40 thousand primary schools
 jisamen 50 tak chaatr kii sankhya vaale skulon main 2 chuulhe or 2 silendar, 51 se 200 chaatr sankhya vaale skool main 2 chuulhe or 3 silendar, 201 se 500 chaatr sankhya vaale skool main 3 chuulhe or 4 silendar or 500 se adhik chaatr sankhya vaale skulon main 4 chuulhe or 5 pach silendar dene kii yojana thi
 But due to slackness of office bearers and violation of financial rules, it could not be complied yet
 sthiti yah he ki is saal may main cabinet se yojana sweekrut hone ke baavjood skulon ko elippiji silendar or chulhaa nahin mil sakaa he
 It is said that under the new Treasury Code, the Finance Department had instructed to keep the amount of the scheme in the PL account through Treasury
 lekin isamen yah samasya aade aa gai ki kharch kaa vauchar dene par hi raashi tregeri se jari hogi
 While this is a completely new plan, now there is a demand to relax the rules
 Now the education department of the state is asking the government to relax the rules for one time, so that they can be bought
 is yojana main lagbhag 42 karod rupee kharch hone kaa anumaan he
 Which includes gas cylinders, regulators, pipes and furnaces, stoves
 inkaa kray skulon main gathit saraswati vahini karegi
 The amount will be transferred to their bank accounts for this
 yah baat he 2009 kii
 Hisar (haryana) painter Manish Joshi at the big cultural center Kingdom of Dreams of Gurugram in those days had a lakh
 maheene kii acchhee-khaasi naukari kar rahe the
 But his work was not really artistic but administrative type
 isi vajah se usamen unhen zyada ras nahin aa rahaa tha
 In the Marwari family, he was the only brother among three sisters and had rebelled with the family and came to the theater, so there was no question of looking back
 kathak nrutyaangna patni raakhi joshi ke saath ek shaam ve dilli ke saanskrithik centre india habitat centre kii sidhippon par yun hi baithe the
 At the same distance, he heard the two half-buddies talking: "man, one thing is now understood that if you have to be national, you have to be local
 '' manish chor kaanon se donon ke tark sunne lage
 After a while, he said clearly to Rakhi, "hisar goes back
 '' kathak jaise shastreey nrity main dilli main kareer kii sambhaavnaaen dekh raheen raakhi hakkaa-bakka!ab haryana ke sheersh rangakarmiyon main shumaar or natyalekhan main sangeet naatak academy kaa bismilla khan award paa chuke manish vah vakya yaad karte hai: ''talaak kii naubat aa gai thi
 Rakhi was not ready to leave Delhi
 kisi tarah raji kiya
 He also remembers the days when, under pressure from his family, he used to come to Delhi on the pretext of meeting Amway Company and watch the drama here
 shriram centre ke book store se unhone do naatak bhi churaae
 Today he is the author of a dozen plays and by performing over 35 plays, his group Acting Theater has become an important center of literary-cultural change in Hisar and surrounding areas
 lakhmichand, maangeram or sthaneey natya, sangeet parampara se judi shakhsiyaton ke alaava unhone maujuun muddon ko bhi vishay banaakar naatak likhe / khele
 His latest play Satnam Waheguru, prepared on Nanak, is gaining popularity
 ab ve haryana ke samajhadaar or gahare hasyabodh vaale bujurg taauon par chachaa choudhary ko centre main rakhkar ek naatak rach rahe hai
 Proving the notion of not being able to do theater in the absence of money, he came up with a unique tactic
 hotelior mitra manoj bansal ke saath milakar unhone shahar ke 60 sambhraant logon ko 11,000 ru
 Special membership given on annuities
 us ekamusth rakam ke boote costum, property or duusare jaruri saamaan jutakar beficri se unhone naatak kiye hai
 There is another section of the audience who will watch the drama at Rs 10 at will
 se 5,100 ru
 Gives up to 2016 main unhone 21 din kaa natyotsav kiya to bheed sanbhaalane ke liye police bulani padi
 Satish Kashyap, a veteran theater artist from Haryana, his mentor, says, "manish's life made it easy to play in a city like Hisar
 varanaa yakeen jaaniye, yahaan lagaataar sakriy or creative bane rahanaa utana aasaan he nahin
 But there has been a deep struggle behind this success
 shuru main naatakon ke liye sponcership lete to das shikaayatein aatin: 'binar par naam chhot gaya'; meraa logo chota kar diya'; 'hamen paas nahin diya'; 'hamen seat hi nahin mili'
 There are still challenges like not getting actors from every age group
 20 vaale ko hi 60 kaa bhi role karnaa padataa he
 But the growing database of viewers in the city has encouraged Manish and his team
 lekin jis pahalu ne is rachanaatmak safar main unhen sabase zyada takat di, vah tha unka haklaana: ''meri hakalaahat ne mere swabhimaan ko chunauti di, mujhe kuch sabit karne ko lalakaara
 Otherwise, i am not here today
 '' sach, kuch khamiyaan manushya kii kitni badi takat ban jaati hai!sangharshaek kaam se jaldi hi ub jane kii aadat ke kaaran jaaduugari, putulkala or theatre on bikes jaise prayog kiye
 Finally, at the ticketing point of 2009 due to theatrical writing, direction and organizational skills, two people in Delhi listened to the talk of 'becoming a national only by becoming a local'
 Inspired to show something big in the genre

 Captain Gautam Gambhir, who won the title for India Blue in the Duleep Trophy matches played with Pink Ball for the first time on Indian pitches, believes Test cricket should be played in the traditional way
 bhartiya team ke purv openar gautam gambhir ne khud ko ‘paramparawaadi’ qaraar kiya jo lambey formet kaa muqabla laal gend se or din main khelnaa pasand karata he, saath hi unhone kaha ki kisi bhi tarah ke prayog sirf tii20 cricket main hi kiya janaa chahie
 After the final of Gambhir Nedlip Trophy, he said, 'I am a traditionalist who likes to play cricket in the old way
 yah meri nijee raay he lekin mujhe lagata he ki is tarah ke badlaav or prayog sirf tii20 cricket main hi kiye jane chahie
 Five-day matches and Test matches should be played with red ball

 Gambhir made 71 in five innings in the tournament

 But they still feel that there is some problem with the pink ball with milky light

 ’ Senior BJP leader LK Advani seems to have not recovered from it, even after five years of controversy arising out of praise for Mohammad Ali Jinnah and has said that he has 'personally' felt that secular country has Pakistan's founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah must have gone through what he advocated
 adwani ne apane bayaan ko adhuraa chhodte hue kaha, ‘main vyaktigat rup se mahasoos kar chukaa hum ki jinna kaa zikr aise vyakti ke rup main kar jo muslim bahul aabaadi ke saath dharm nirpeksh desh chaahate the
 'but by saying this, the BJP leader gave enough clues as to what he wanted to say
 varsh 2005 main pakistan yatra ke dauraan jinna ko dharm nirpeksh bataane ke baad adwani ko party ke adhyaksh pad se istipha dena padaa tha
 He referred to the incident again last evening in the book 'tinderbox' by noted journalist MJ Akbar
 
 The Past and Future of Pakistan
 jinna ko dharm nirpeksh bataane par adwani ko aresas or bhaajapa ke bheetar kai netaaon dwaara khuleam unki aalochana kiye jane tathaa unka istipha maange jane ke baad adhyaksh pad chhodane ko vivash hona padaa tha
 The RSS and BJP later softened their stance towards Advani and projected him as the prime ministerial candidate in the election
 kal kitaab ke vimochan avasar par adwani ne jinna kaa ullekh phir se dharm nirpeksh ke rup main kiya or pakistan kii raajnneetik asthirataa ke liye moulana abul alaa maududi jaise logon ko jimmedaar tehraaya jinhone dvirashtra ke siddhant ko pratipaadit kiya
 He also blamed dictator Zia ul Haq for the political instability of Pakistan
 kitaab main akbar ke vichaaron kaa samarthan karte hue adwani ne kaha ‘vah (lekhak) sahi kehete hai ki pakistan sthir or aadhunik desh tabhi ban saktaa he jab pakistan ke janak jinna ke bachche maududi ke vaicharik uttaradhikariyon ko haraa paaen
 Advani agreed with the author and further said, "jinnah may be the father of Pakistan but the father of religion was Maududi and its impact was very wide and large
 ’jinna maamle main apana paksh rakhte hue adwani ne kaha, ‘samvidhan sabha main unki pehali tippanee hi aisi thi jis par bharat main kai logon ne khaskar mere jaise vichaar rakhane waalon ne kaha
 
 yah kya he? aap jinna ko aise vyakti ke rup main dekh sakate hai jo chaahate the ki pakistan dharmanirpeksh desh bane
 Senior BJP leaders were firm on the stance that instability in Pakistan was "definitely a threat to India" but disagreed that it would be fragmented
 pustak main akbar ne pakistan ko aisa desh qaraar diya jahaan na kabhi sthirataa ho sakati he or na kabhi vah tut saktaa he
 He also expressed concern over Pakistan's stock of nuclear weapons
 pakistan ke punjab praant ke governor salmaan taasir kii hatya kaa zikr karte hue adwani ne kaha ki aisi ghatana bharat main nahin hoti
 He said, 'if he were in India, such an incident would not have happened
 isse zyada pareshaan karne vaali baat he ki unke antim sanskaar ke liye maulavee aage nahin aae
 This is shocking
 ’ Now the Bar Council of India is also seen in action regarding the statements of the lawyers of the perpetrators in the documentary on Nirbhaya case

 Bar Council of India Chairman Manan Kumar Mishra has said that both the lawyers have to reply within three weeks and if the committee is not satisfied with the reply, their licenses can be canceled
 iske alaava kai bade vakil bhi nirbhaya ke doshiyon ke vakeelon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii maang kar rahe hai
 KTS Tulsi says that it seems from the statements of AP Singh and ML Sharma that there is a similarity between the perpetrators and their statements, no decent lawyer can have such language
 vahiin mahila vakil abha singh kaa kahana he ki yah mudda pehle bhi baar council ke paas aayaa tha, lekin tab cameti ne vakeelon par koi karrwai nahin kii
 At the same time, both the lawyers say that the statements they have made are upheld
 vakil emel sharma ne kaha ki unhone court ke khilaaf kuch nahin bolaa he or unka koi bhi bayaan court ke khilaaf nahin he
 They say that even after the ban of the court, those who are watching the documentary and demanding action on them, should actually take action against them

 The Samajwadi Party (SP) has rejected the claims of Narendra Modi's wave in the country, saying that if such an atmosphere were to happen, then the big leaders of the BJP would not find a safe seat and this national party was aligned with small parties in 'desperation' Do not have to devise to do
 sapa mahasachiv naresh agarwal ne kaha, yadi modiji kii lahar hoti, to phir ye chote-chote dalon se samjhauta kyon kar rahe hai? apana dal-paraayaa dal, pataa nahin kin-kin dalon ko saath lene kii koshish main hai
 These parties have no existence of their own
 bijepi main kahin na kahin hataasha he
 If there is a wave, the BJP should contest the elections alone in the country
 vah sahyogiyon kii talash kyon kar rahi he? He said, the reality is that the BJP is aware of its internal situation
 use maaloom he ki vah satta main nahin aa rahi he
 If there was an atmosphere in favor of this party, its leaders would not seek safe seats and seek allies
 agarwal ne chunaav purv surveykshanon ko khaarij karte hue kaha, aaj tak koi surveykshan sapa ke paksh main nahin rahaa he
 The actual results contrast with these surveys
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main bhi ye surveykshan galat sabit hue
 The atmosphere is being created in the media only in favor of BJP
 yah puche jane par ki sapa, modi ko apane liye chunauti maanati he, to agarwal ne kaha, netaa ji (mulaayam) kah chuke hai ki hamaari ladaai bijepi se he
 We have always stopped the BJP
 use rokna hamaari jimmedaari he or is baar bhi ham is jimmedaari ko puri tarah nibhaayenge
 Rajya Sabha member Aggarwal alleged that Modi is causing a lot of uproar within the BJP
 unhone kaha, bijepi main vidroh kii sthiti he
 Advani has expressed his pain
 sushamaa swaraj pidaa vyakt kar chuki hai
 Doctor (murali Manohar) Joshi has also done something similar
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh bhi samay-samay pidaa par vyakt karte rahe hai
 Mohan Bhagwat Ji himself said that what is namo-namo, the BJP follows the ideology
 sapa netaa ne kaha, bijepi jwalamukhi ke parvat par baithi hui he
 It can burst anytime
 ek baar tikat bant jane dijie, phir dekhie kaisaa ghamaasan machataa he

 From his party's poor performance in Uttar Pradesh elections to allegations of irregularities in its Purti group companies, Gadkari, 55, would like to forget this year
 ab duusari baar unke bijepi adhyaksh banane kii sambhaavna bhi uljhi hui dikh rahi he
 The party amended the constitution to make it possible
 laalkrishna adwani, yashavanth sinha or jaswant singh jaise party ke kai varisht netaa sanket de chuke hai ki gadakari ne ab adhyaksh bane rahane ke liye naitik aadhaar kho diya he
 Despite Gadkari being fully engaged, the party remained in the Uttar Pradesh elections
 ‘‘chaunkaane vaale nattejey” dene ke vaade ke saath kiye gaye unke sabhi prayog naakaam rahe
 The inverse result of bringing controversial RSS official Sanjay Joshi and inducting scam-tainted BSP leader Babusinh Kushwaha into the party

 Likewise, Gadkari dealt with the dispute in Karnataka, the only South Indian state under the BJP government, and B
 es
 Advani was also openly critical of Yeddyurappa
 party netaaon ko lagata he ki gadakari ke in kadamon se bijepi ke bhrashtachar virdohi abhiyaan ko nuksaan ho rahaa he
 Their thinking is right
 badhati keemton or bhrashtachar par upie ke khilaaf logon main badhate gusse kaa phayda uthaane main bijepi vifal hi rahi he
 Never before has the BJP looked like this on any issue
 ab aresas gadakari ke madhyam se party ke chote se chote maamalon main bhi dakhlandaji kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, Gadkari has failed to prove his critics wrong

 Based on this, a chargesheet was filed in the court
 sibiai ne adaalat ko bataaya tha ki shashi singh ne peedita ko naukari dilaane ke bahaane kuldeep singh senger ke ghar le gaya
 The statement given by the victim to the CBI was placed by the CBI in front of the judge
 sibiai ne court ko bataaya tha ki us vakt vahaan (ghar) par koi maujuud nahin tha
 There were not even security personnel there
 peedita ne vahaan jane ke bare main ghar main kisi ko nahin bataaya tha
 Shashi took her inside the house through the back door
 jaise hi peedita uske ghar ke andar pravesh kar rahi thi, tabhi kuldeep singh senger ne use dikhaai diya, usne peedita kaa haath khinchaa or kamare ke andar le gaya tha
 On the order of the Supreme Court in this case, accused MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar has been shifted to Tihar Jail in Delhi
 peedita ko bhi ilaaj ke liye ames laayaa gaya he
 Where he is undergoing treatment

 😁 It's so strange to make a portrait of someone who's been photographed so many times! When i first met these two, Anushka said "all i want is my wedding moments to be captured and i don't want anything filmy!"
 This was music to my ears but i also really wanted to make a couple of timeless posed portraits and we negotiated a window of 3-5mins per event to make a portrait

 congress party ne rajkumaar patel ko madhyapradesh congress ke mahaamantri pad se hataa diya he
 The Congress gave Patel a Congress ticket from Vidisha but his nomination was rejected due to not having an 'A' form
 ye baat congress ke gale nahin utar rahi thi ki aakhir 'e' farm diye jane ke baad bhi rajkumaar patel ne use parche ke saath jamaa kyon nahi kiya
 Madhya Pradesh in-charge of Congress, BK Hariprasad, announced the removal of Patel from the post of state general secretary after investigating the entire matter

 abhijaat varg ke logon ke samooh ko party main bhaar grahan karne ke liye protsaahit kiya gaya
 The common man thought of taking a back seat and the intention of such people is to complete personal projects on the dreams of the common man
 agarwal ne kaha ki is kaaran se nuksaan hota dikh rahaa he ki hataasha kii bhaavana saamne aa rahi he or us patibaddhta kaa koi matlab nahin banataa
 He said that he was not able to do justice to those for whom he had become part of the movement

 Those who are engaged in creating wealth are also assets to our country

 Such a rapid growth cannot happen without the strength and co-operation in business and industry

 As part of the forgotten bureaucracy campaign by digging pits in houses, toilets started in every house, but in many places this exercise became a problem for people
 darabha ghati ke lendra gaanv main kareeb 500 gharon main shauchalay nirmaan ke liye gadde khode gaye or gadde khodakar afasar bhul gaye
 a pit was dug for a toilet in the house of a village farmer, Ganga Ram
 jisamen girakar uski bhens tak mar gai
 People cannot even fill these pits again because they have been dug up by the government and they cannot even build toilets because the money is with the government
 sarkari daftaron ke chakkar kaat rahe logbastar ke logon ke liye bhi pradhanmantri kaa swatchta abhiyaan musiibat ban gaya
 Pits were dug up by officers to build toilets in homes, but toilets were not built
 ek saal se gaanv ke log sarkari daftaron kaa chakkar kaat-kaat kar pareshaan ho gaye, lekin unki museebataan jas kii tas hai
 a strange campaign over toilets also raised questions on the manner in which the pm's sanitation drive was implemented by the DM of Sitamarhi district in Bihar
 jiladhikari rajeev roshan ke netritv main jile ke afasar subah-subah gaanv-dehaat or khet-khalihaan kii taraf nikal padate
 During this time, women and men found defecating in the open are arrested and taken to the nearest police station
 jahaan unase band bharwakar, jurmaana vasuulakar hi unhen choda jaataa
 At the same time, open defecation people were given unique punishment in Bilaspur of Chhattisgarh
 logon ko jaanwaron ke pinjre main band kar shahar se dur jangal main chhod diya, jahaan se wo paidal aae
 ODF created trouble: Open defecation free (ODF) campaign has become a cause of trouble for the people even in Vajharajasthan
 logon ke liye shauchalay banvaanaa baari pad rahaa he
 It costs about twenty thousand rupees to build a toilet
 sarkaar bas baarah hajaar rupee hi detii he
 Remaining amount is difficult to arrange or villagers have to borrow and build toilets at high interest rate

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious plan 'skill India' is in a shambles
 saal 2016 main shuru kii gai pradhanmantri kaushal vikaas yojana (PMKVY) ke antargat 11 november tak 69
 03 lakh people were given training, but only 15 of them
 4 lakh logon ko hi naukari mil pai, yani 25 pratishat se bhi kam
 The surprising thing is that out of these 69 lakh people, only 26 got jobs abroad
 duusari taraf, jin logon ko naukari mili he unka ausat vetan maatr 7800 rupee prati maah he
 Actually, Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha member Mo
 nadimul haq ne sarkaar se 'skill india' ke tahat training, placement or oversij imployament aadi kaa lekha-jokha maanga tha, unke sawaalon ke jawaab main sarkaar ne jo data uplabdh karaayaa he, wo chaunkaane vaala he
 According to the data provided by RK Singh, Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, 38 till 11 November 2019 under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY)
 01 lakh logon ko alpavadhi prashikshan (short Term Training) or 31
 02 lakh people were given training under Recognition of Prior Learning, but even after training, the job condition is poor
 69
 Out of 03 lakh people, only 22 percent got the job
 nunatam vetan se bhi kam ausat selary According to the government, under PMKVY (2016-20), the candidates taking training are being provided employment or wage employment, in which the wages are equal to or equal to the minimum wage
 lekin sarkaar ne jo data diya he, wo chaunkaane vaala he
 According to the government, the average salary of the candidates under PMKVY is about Rs
 7800 per month
 jo kai rajyon ke nunatam vetan yaa nunatam mazdooree se bhi kam he

 The show's stance is changing daily between fights and love between contestants
 is hafte himanshi khurana ke beghar hone se kuch contestant naaraaz hai, jisase unke swabhaav main bhi achaanak badlaav dekhne ko mila he
 The first name in it is Aseem Riyaz
 ghar se beghar hone ke baad himanshi khurana bhi aseem riyaj ko saport kar rahi hai
 During an interview, he has told his best friends in the house, Shefali Jariwala and Aseem Riaz
 vahiin, ab times of india ko die intervyuu main sho ke mekars par bhedbhaav karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Himanshi Khurana said, 'avixation was completely planned
 captain ko contestant ko nominete karne kaa adhikaar dena or paras chhabda ko bich main se surgery ke liye baahar bhejnaa sawaal khadey karata he
 Everyone knows Paras Chhabra got the least votes last week
 ye puri tarah pland or phek najar aa rahaa he
 Voting lines were opened after Paras moved out of the house
 ant main big bos ne aviction kaa puraa adhikaar gharavaalon ko de diya, jo ki anfere he
 This is not the decision of the audience
 'aseem ko miss kar rahi hai himanshi?himanshi ne kaha, 'mujhe avict karnaa puri tarah bhedbhaav bharaa tha, agar audiyans ne meraa naam liya hota to mujhe bilkul bura nahin lagata
 i had a feeling that this time i will go out because things were completely different as they were happening
 balki ye sab pehle se fiks tha
 Giving Siddharth the right of nomination, sending Paras out
 hamen bahut tareeke se fansaaya gaya tha taaki hamamen se koi ek jaae
 Himanshi has also accused the show makers of favoring Siddharth Shukla
 aisa kai baar hua he jab unka gussa dikhaaya nahin gaya he, jabaki anya logon ko choti-choti baat par bhi fatkaar lagaai gai he
 Speaking on Aseem, Himanshi Khurana said, 'in a very short period of time i became a good friendship with Aseem and it was a friendship without any deceit
 aseem riyaj ne mere liye bahut kuch kiya, usne meraa dhyaan rakhaa jab main thik nahin thi
 We also took each other's stand
 hamaari dosti ghar ke baahar bhi rahegi
 Every girl will feel lucky if she has a boy like Aseem
 ' 6 on 3 December, a week after the terrorist attack
 50 baje mumbai ke bheed bhare railway stesan chhatrapati shivaji terminus (siasti) ke plateform number 15 par 8 kilo visphotak ardex se bhare do thile baraamad hue
 These RDX were kept in such a bag as the terrorists were loaded on their back and placed in a corner of the terminus along with the belongings of the passengers who were victims of their attack
 yah shahar stabdh he or aisi police ke bharose he jisase hameshaa chaukanna rahane kii ummid kii jaati he
 You would have thought that after the attack on the CST, the police would have sifted through the evidence and put sniffing dogs and all the items would have been checked
 lekin ek saptaah baad bhi siasti par visphotak baraamad kiye gaye
 As if India's worst terrorist attack has not happened yet
 isi laaparvaahee, or sthiti ko bhaanpakar karrwai karne kii aakshamata ke kaaran aatankwaadiyon ko apni aisi sajeesh ko anjaam dene kaa mauka mil gaya jise bharat kaa 9 / 11 bataaya ja rahaa he
 The attack killed 173 people and injured 288 people
 aatankwaad se nibatane kii buniyadi ranneeti-koun, kahaan, kab, kyon or kaise kya kuch kar saktaa he-raajnneeti kaa shikaar ho gai
 Thomas Keane, the head of the National Commission investigating the 9 / 11 attacks in the US, said that these attacks exposed not the failure of intelligence but the policy, management, capability and above all, the "failure of hypothesis"
 unki baat 26 / 11 mumbai main aatankwaadi hamalon ke bare main bhi lagu ho sakati he
 Militants came by sea, targeted the towers of the Taj and Oberoi, wanted to blow up an airport and give their cause an international dimension by targeting foreign nationals and above all a Yedi outreach center at Nariman House
 research and analysis wing (ro) ne sitambar se 19 november ke dauraan kam-se-kam chah khufia reporton main samudri raste se fidaayin hamale kii ashanka jataai thi
 They repeatedly said that the Taj Hotel and CST station could be attacked
 iske baavjood aatankwaadi aaraam se samudri raste se aae, berokatoke tat par utre or puure shahar main kahar barapaaya
 As has been the case, the state government said that it did not receive any warning and the central government insisted that it had warned the state
 bhartiya parampara ke anuroop, yahaan har koi jimmedaar he lekin koi javabdeh nahin he
 The linking of events shows that everything that could have been ruined has deteriorated
 yah shahar maano is hamale kaa intjaar kar rahaa tha
 For example, three agencies patrol the coast - the Navy, Coast Guard and Marine Patrol at sea
 nausena ne yah kahkar pallaa jhaad liya ki vah samudr ke doordaraj ilaakon kii nigaraanee karti he
 The Coast Guard made excuses for not having enough staff and equipment
 aakhir, is kshetra main 5,000 trollar hai or un sabaki jaanch karnaa naammumkin he
 In addition, the militants landed in an area which is monitored by the Marine Police
 1993-94 se lagu mereen fishing regulation act (emephare) ke tahat centre rajya sarkaron kii gashti naukaaen or sanchaar upkarnon kii kharid ke liye sau fisadi rakam sahaayta kaa rup main de saktaa he
 But the state governments have failed to implement the scheme
 mahalekha pareekshak or niyantrak (sieji) ke mutabik, maharashtra ne rakrakhaav kaa kaam puraa nahin kiya or paise kaa puraa istemaal nahin kiya
 Believe it or not, the police have only five boats to monitor the 760 km beaches of Maharashtra, two of which are defective
 prashasan kii sharmnaak laaparvaahee kaa andaja lagane ke liye jaraa is tathy par gaur kiijie- aatankwaadiyon ne kuch mile kii duuri or tay kii hoti to ve pashchimi tat par bhabha parmaanu anusandhan centre yaa nausainik thikaanon yaa phir tel shodhak kaarkaanon par dhaava bol sakate the
 Its results can only be imagined
 mukhya sthal par kshamta koi behatar nahin he
 When the terrorists attacked three places almost simultaneously, the Mumbai Police was trying to grapple with the enemy with pathetic leadership, poor coordination and old-fashioned methods and weapons
 unka akalan bhi sahi nahin tha
 Director General of Police A
 en
 Rai, anti-terrorism Squad (ATS) chief Hemant Karkare and Deputy Chief Minister R
K
 aar
 Patil 9 night of 26 November
 15 baje ek baithak se nikalakar ghar ja rahe the tabhi unhen pehla kol mila
 The first assessment was: There is firing between criminal gangs outside the Leopold Cafe
 hamalaa badhane ke saath hi adhikari ghatnasthal kii ore ravaanaa ho gaye
 Knowing that the terrorists were armed with an AK-47, the Mumbai police took to the road with carbines and 9 mm pistols
 ek ore jahaan police inspector shashaank scindia aatankwaadiyon se nibat rahe the, vahiin railway police adhikariyon ke paas koi hathiyaar nahin the
 He had to go to the consignment to get his rifle
 jab tak ve laute tab tak aatankwaadiyon ne 58 logon ko maar daal tha or scindia shahid ho gaye the
 Now compare this with the terrorists
 prayek aatankwaadi ke paas ek kalashnicove, nau magazine (prayek main 30 goliyaan), alag se 150 goliyaan, nau hathgole or paanch magazine ke saath ek pistaul tathaa uski har magazine main 18 goliyaan thim
 And the ATS had only 35 members to deal with such a huge crisis
 1999 main 200 sadasyeey commando force gathit kiya gaya tha lekin baad kii sarkaron ne use pratibandhit kar diya tha
 The story of the instruments is tragic
 kareeb 18 maheene pehle hi tatkaaleen police mahanideshak pi
 s
 pasrichaa ne hathiyaaron ke aadhunikeekaran kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 But due to the rage between Finance, Planning and Home Department, that proposal got approval in 'principle' last month
 is raftaar se police ko 2010 tak hathiyaar nahin mil paaenge
 Old 
 303 riflon or unki goliyon kaa utpaadan band ho gaya he lihaaja unhen firing range main parakhane kaa kaam nahin hota
 Many rifles were jammed
 siasti par consteble ajit kumaar nalwade ne ek peyajal nal ke peeche se aatankwaadiyon par teen goliyaan chalaayin or unki carbine jam ho gai
 The officers were wearing bulletproof jackets but bullets fired from AK-56 and AK-47 also distinguished them
 2004 main in jacketon ke namoonay firing range main jaanch ke liye bheje gaye the
 Each bullet of the SLR and the AK-47 pierced him, though he was targeted from a distance
 purv ipies adhikari vaai
 P
 singh kehete hai, ''police ke aadhunikeekaran par har saal 100 karod ru
 More than is spent but the quality of the jacket used is very poor
 '' nagappa mali or unki team ne doordarshita or had darje kii bahaduree ke boote aatankwaadiyon ko girgaanv choupati main pakadaa, jabaki kisi bhi consteble ke paas bulatopruf jacket nahin tha
 The killing of Karkare, Inspector Vijay Salaskar and Additional Commissioner of Police Ashok Kamte shows the incomplete preparation and training of the police and the lack of strategy or planning in times of crisis
 darasal, raay bhi maanate hai ki ''fouran harakat main aa gaye lekin is par gaur kiya janaa chahie tha ki ve aatankwaadiyon ko nibatane main sakasham the yaa nahin
 This confession in a state that has suffered three serious terrorist attacks tells a story of apathy
 do hotalon or siasti ko nishaanaa banaae jane ke ghante bhar ke andar hi unhen spasht ho janaa chahie tha ki yah bada aatankwaadi hamalaa he
 In principle, the members of the crisis management group under the leadership of the chief secretary should have met within an hour
 mumbai main mukhya sachiv apane ghar par the, sankat kaksh main dijipi, patil or aalaa adhikari baithe hue the tathaa grih sachiv chitrakala jutshi duusare logon ke saath hi taj ke si lounj main fansi hui thim or madad kii guhaar laga rahi thim
 Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh was in Kerala and reached Mumbai at 3 am
 rajya sarkaar ke paas salaah kii kami nahin thi
 Deshmukh had announced the formation of Maharashtra Security Council last Tuesday itself to advise the state
 mumbai main serial dhamaakon ke baad sitambar, 2006 main isi tarah kii parishad kaa gathan kiya gaya tha jisamen sena or police ke adhikari shaamil the
 Council member and 20-year experience of "counter-insurgency and terror" campaigns, Lieutenant General D
 bi
 Shektkar states that no meeting of this council took place after August 2007
 isse bhi badtar yah ki uske sujhaavon-jisamen tateey kshetron kii nigaraanee badhanaa or coli samudaay ko isamen jodna shaamil tha-ko kaaphi had tak nazarandaaj kar diya gaya
 This negligence made way for terrorists to carry out attacks on their own free will
 jutshi or hotalon main fanse duusare bandhakon kii madad kii guhaar ke maddenjar rajya ko enesji kii fouran maang rakh deni chahie thi
 But the state demanded the NSG at midnight from the Center
 itane ghante main kaaphi logon ko bachaaya ja saktaa tha
 The commandos arrived in Mumbai at 6 am on 27 November and people from all over the world watching television saw them marching to the scene in the buses of BEST
 haalanki enesji ne khud acha kaam kiya lekin taj kii safai main 50 ghante lagane par sawaal khadey hote hai
 Yes, they did not have a map of the Taj and they were guessing the action while the terrorists seemed to be familiar with every corner of the Taj
 or haa, enesji ko shahari gurila yuddh kaa prashikshan nahin mila tha
 But counter-terrorism experts ask how it took so long? Why was gas not used in this campaign? In Operation Black Thunder, the NSG used Yellow Phosphorus to burn the terrorists to ashes
 lekin mumbai main aisa na kiye jane kii vajah nahin bataai gai
 It is unforgivable that this elite force also lacks equipment
 yuavi yaa mobile kaman post jaisi aalaa darje kii suvidhaon ko bhul jaaie, commando ne buniyadi upkarnon ke bina hi aatankwaadiyon se morcha liya
 a few minutes before leaving Delhi, black cats were eagerly calling at the airport to order ballistic jackets
 yah sankat netritv kii naakaami or vyavastha chaupat hone kii vajah se gambhir ho gaya
 For example, although the Trident Hotel was cleaned, the hostages could not be taken out until 28 November, while Police Commissioner Hassan Gafoor was posted outside the hotel
 yahaan tak ki soochna kii buniyadi vyavastha bhi nadaarad thi
 There was no system to help troubled relatives
 unhen koi bataane vaala nahin tha ki koun maaraa gaya, ghayal hua yaa bandhak he
 In such a situation, the market of rumors was hot
 police ko maaloom nahin tha ki shahar main kitne aatankwaadi ghuse hai
 At first they said that 12 terrorists had entered, then Deshmukh and Patil told their number "about 25" and finally 10 were found out
 lekin andeh barkaraar he
 Were there more terrorists? Did they enter the hotel or work there? How did they last for 50 hours? Did they already keep weapons and shells? The explosions of Vile Parle and Wadi Bandar still remain a mystery
 ve visphot kisne karaae? kya hawaldda bhi nishane par tha? hotalon se 700 logon kii jaanch kiye bina hi unhen baahar nikaal diya gaya
 Did some terrorists also escape in them? Do they exist in the city? Mumbai and countrymen would like answers to these questions in the coming days
 shuukravaar kii raat sankat khinchne ke saath hi patil ne raay se poocha ki kya taj kii safai main mumbai police enesji se kandhaa mila sakati he
 Gafoor refused
 unhone bataaya ki ve is abhiyaan ke liye prashikshit nahin hai or unke paas upkaran bhi nahin hai
 The average policeman has been doing duty duty throughout the year and firing less than five bullets at the training range (whereas any Commando Force personnel shoots at least 150 bullets)
 ve kisi tarah se bhi sakasham nahin the
 This is shocking
 lekin yah bhayaavah he ki netaaon or naukarshahi ne haalat itani bigadane die
 There is so much rot in the name of Mumbai's security and the people of Mumbai and the country are full of anger due to its odor

 It is to be noted that the Hindi translation of Saba Naqvi's famous English book 'shades of Saffron: Vajpayee to Modi' has been printed from Vani Prakashan in May this year, 'the political side of saffron: from Vajpayee to Modi'

 i am grateful to Vani Prakashan for presenting my book with such beauty in the Hindi world
 main vaaki bahut kush hum ki yah kitaab hindi pathakon tak pahonchegi
 Sabah also gave bewildered answers to questions related to language and translation
 sabaa naqvi kaa kahana tha ki kuch shabd or bhav aise hai jinka anuwaad mushkil he, jinamein kai hindi muhaavarey shaamil hai

 Citing an article from Sabah on secularism, Love asked if issues like secularism or indigenous language would be discussed when this book came to Hindi? In response to this, Saba said that the new India will now place these issues and indigenous words in its language and lifestyle
 sabaa naqvi ne is dauraan bhartiya janata party or congress ko lekar apane dheron anubhav bhi saajha kiye
 He said that today the nature of the BJP is to keep itself closed, but it was not so before

 In this case, he cannot compete
 patrkaar hansraj ne sawaal kiya ki kya ab sahi dhang se suchanaaen nahin aa rahi hai? ke uttar main sabaa nakvi ne kaha ki kya ab koi exlusive khabar aapane dekhi he
 The Congress is a weak and organizationally weak party

 There are many other reasons for the weakness of the Congress, such as Mandal, temple, etc
, she could not recognize issues
 isi tarah log amir ho gaye or party kangaal
 But the BJP is very strong as an organization
 sabaa naqvi ne afsos jaahir karte hue kaha ki bhaajapa main bhi ab vyaktvaad aa gaya he
 He said that i used to say that Congress is the gatekeeper's party, but now something similar is happening with BJP

 The slight majority won by the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh is overshadowing the legislative traditions of the state assembly
 vipaksh ko dipti spikar kaa pad dene kii parampara kareeb 29 saal se chali aa rahi thi
 But the Congress ended its tradition by appointing its candidate Hina Kavre to the post
 rajya ke purv mukhyamantri sunderlaal patwa ne saal 1990 main yah parampara shuru kii thi ki rajya main spikar or dipti spikar kaa chayan aam sahmati se kiya jayega
 In his later governments — twice led by Digvijay Singh and three times with Shivraj Singh Chauhan as chief minister — the tradition continued
 aadhikarik taur par congress kaa daawa he ki spikar pad ke liye ummidavaar khadaa karke pehle bhaajapa ne is parampara ko todaa he or aam sahmati se chunaav kii tay parampara se alag hati he

 After Prajapati's election, Chief Minister Kamal Nath said, "A lot has changed in politics, now the time is quite different
 '' is tarah unhone pehle hi yah sanket de diya tha ki dipti spikar ke maamle main kya hone vaala he
 Many believe that the ruling Congress has taken both the posts in view of its marginal majority
 purv mantri or bhaajapa ke vidhayak vishwaas saarang kehete hai, ''congress to bhaajapa ko dipti spikar ke pad se vanchit karne kaa bas bahaanaa dhund rahi thi
 He claimed that the Congress did not want the BJP to get this post because if the Deputy Speaker had demanded the Division during the proceedings of the House, the Congress could have caused a lot of trouble for the government
 kaaware ke dipti spikar chune jane ke baad digvijay singh ne kaha, ''puraani bhaajapa ab ateet kii baat ho chuki he, jisamen sundar laal patwa jaise netaa the
 He said that the 'new BJP' did not follow the traditions in any way
 bhaajapa ne donon padon par apane ummidavaar utaare, jabaki uske paas aankade nahin hai
 According to BJP sources, the state unit of the party was not unanimous and many mlas were not in favor of fielding candidates, but ultimately everyone had to accept the central leadership

 Hearing what happened to three people due to political opposition in Bihar, your hair will stand
 teen logon ko jinamein do dalit the, ghode se baandhakar rassiyon se kaaphi dur tak ghasita gaya, iske baad unhen ek pole se baandh kar pistal ke bat se unke chehre par waar kiya gaya
 This barbaric incident is from Khairpur village in Navagakshia district of the state
 teenon ghayalon ko gaanv ke hi aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya, jahaan unki haalat gambhir bani hui he
 The injured have been identified as Janata Dal United (JDU) Kharik Block Dalit Cell president Bablu Das, his Dalit partner Neeraj Das and a party worker Kapil Dev Manda
 jadyu ke sthaneey vidhayak narendra kumaar ne police ko is ghatana kii soochna di
 According to sources, the incident was carried out by Ajay Yadav, a close relative of the local head
 usne pehle bike se ja rahen in teen logon ke upar goli chalaai or jab ye bike se gir gaye to yadav or uske saathiyon ne teenon ko ghode se baandha or mukhiya ke ghar ghasitkar le gaye
 Here they were beaten very brutally by tying them to a pole
 navgkshia ke espi shekhar kumaar ne bataaya ki mukhya aaropee ajay yadav ko giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he
 The SP attributed the incident to a mutual rivalry between the two sides
 espi ne bataaya ki ghayalon ne yadav ke khilaaf essi-asti act ke tahat cese darj kara diya he
 On the other hand, Yadav and his associates have registered a case of illegal possession of arms under the Arms Act
 haalanki unhone is baat se inkaar kiya ki ghayalon ko ghode se baandh kar ghasita gaya tha
 According to Narendra Kumar, it is common for horse-drawn criminals to drag their opponents on the Ganges banks of Navagakshiya
 espi ne kaha, ghatana ke peeche raajnneetik ranjish jimmedaar he
 The accused has already done this kind of incident

" ’’ In October 2013, officials from China and India signed the Border Defense Cooperation Agreement under which the border management is processed by regular talks between the two countries' forces along the Line of Actual Control

 As governor i should not have made such a statement, but my personal thinking is what i said
 bahut-se rajaneta or bade naukarshah bhrashtachar main duube hue hai
 "it is known that on Sunday at a tourism program in Kargil of Ladakh division, Malik said," These boys who have taken up arms are killing their own people, they are PSO (private security officers) and SPO (special police officers) ) Are killing
 inaki hatya kyon kar rahe ho? unki hatya karo jinhone kashmir kii smapda luti he
 Have you killed any of them? ”former Chief Minister and Jammu Kashmir National Conference leader Omar Abdullah reacted sharply to the Governor's remarks
 unhone kaha ki malik ko dilli main apni pratishtha kii padtaal kerani chahie
 Abdullah tweeted, "this person who is apparently holding a responsible constitutional post and is asking terrorists to assassinate leaders who are considered corrupt
" ''jammu-kashmir ke rajyapal ke bayaan par rajya congress pramukh ji e mir se poocha, ‘‘kya vah jangal raaj ko badhaava dene kii koshish kar rahe hai?'' unhone kaha ki malik jis sanvaidhanik pad par hai, unka yah bayaan uski garima ke khilaaf he
 However, the Governor immediately said that taking up arms can never solve any problem and he gave the example of LTTE in Sri Lanka

 udhar, bharat ke niyantran evam mahalekhapareekshak (kaig) ne kaha tha ki air india ko pichley vitt varsh main parichaalan munaafe ke bajaay vastav main 321
 There was an operating loss of Rs 4 crore
 airline ne isse pehle varsh ke dauraan parichaalan munafa hone kii jaankaree di thi
 The CAG, however, clarified that there was no manipulation of the data, rather the figures reported by the airline were in fact 'reduced losses'
 ’ Often, when i do not understand what to write or how to write on politics, i start imagining with my long-time colleague the late Rajni Kothari
 ve prakhar raajnneeti vigyaani the
 Was a great listener
 ve ghanton sun sakate the or aisa karte hue kisi lipaphe ke peeche nots lete rahete
 Even more spectacular is that Rajni used to make unique suggestions
 ek baar unhone mujhase kaha, ''visheshgyon kii baat mat suno
 The expert is a master of possibilities
 baahar jaao or logon se gap ladaao
 This will start your thought process
 dhyaan rahe, tumhaare saath acha yah he ki tum raajnneeti vigyaani nahin ho
 "when i was asked to write on Rahul, i followed Rajni's advice
 rahul sambhaavna to jagaate hai, lekin bhram bhi paidaa karte hai
 i saw a picture of him from the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, which looks like it is lost somewhere
 ve bilkul modi se ulat hai
 
 
 Luckily i met an old friend who is an artist, he gave me a new vision
 maine unhen bataaya ki rahul pinochhio (ek kaalpanik comic paatr) jaise lagate hai, jisaki naak viksit nahin hui he
 My friend laughed and said that you are talking old
 ''rahul," usne jor dekar kaha ki archi comics ke paatr dikhte hai
 Mildly manipulating the memorable phrase of Milan Kundera, he expresses an unbearable feeling like taking life lightly
 meri mitra hans padi or kaha ki ve beshak comic duniya ke kirdaar jaise lagate hai, lekin isi vajah se ve raajnneeti kii duruh duniya se bache hue hai
 In contrast, look at Modi today
 ve bahut kathor dikhte hai, bilkul tusaad mujium ke sakht putalon jaise
 He seems like the inventor of some strange science, ruthless like an assistant to a magician, while something between Rahul Sthamed and Archie
 ve ab bhi bahut pyaare lagate hai or naitik rup se saubhaahgya se bedaag hai
 In cartoons, even if they appear in diapers tied to children or children in carts, they look like a boy in the neighborhood
 chalis se upar kaa hone ke baavjood chiryuva lagate hai, jabaki modi klaant se lagate hai
 Modi's "discussion on tea" looks like a committee meeting, a ruthless ritual, but there is still speculation about Rahul
 yahi hamaare comic kitaab ke kirdaar kaa jaadu he
 Another friend made a different kind of assessment
 usne kaha, gujarat main rahul megi sos-kuch alag swaad vaale-jaise lage or logon ko kuch alag hi swaad mila, haalanki patrkaar aisa kuch nahin bataa sake
 They looked far more comfortable and more capable
 mere mitra ne kaha ki america jane ke baad unamem badlaav aayaa he
 Wondering where Pitroda took them
 maano ve kisi jine master ke palle pade or usne rahul kii rachanaatmakataa ko dhar di
 He said, "they are introverted
 aapke bheetar kuch na ho, to aap rifl ke nishanebaaj yaa phir akido ke master nahin ho sakate
 "they seem serious and alert to issues, are good listeners, seem comfortable in face-to-face interactions, although they are not good speakers in public forums
 unamem ek badlaav yah bhi aayaa he ki lagata he, ve apane bhaashan khud taiyaar karte hai, na ki digvijay singh jaise kisi puraane congressi ke kahe ko doharaate hai
 Another old expert from Gujarat says, "it seems that the idea of mobilizing youth is their own
" teen yuva netaaon, naaraaz patidaar hardik patel or alpesh thakur ke saath milakar rahul ne raajnneeti main yuvaaon ke paridrishy ko badal diya he, jisase modi ko purana raag alaapna pad rahaa he or ve sonia tathaa rahul ko gaiyr-hindu yani bahari sabit karne par utar aae hai
 "rahul is not only connecting caste, but also disenchanted and active youth as a social force and when these youth claim that the glow of development has faded like demonetisation, Modi's The terminology suddenly starts to get tight
 rahul kifayat bhi barat rahe hai
 There are no longer long and monotonous speeches
 ve do-took bolte hai or jiesti yaa notebandi par pradhanmantri se acchhee taiyaari kiye lagate hai
 People feel something different
 modi kii haa main haa milaane vaala press bhi hawa main alag tarah kii gandh ko mahasoos kar saktaa he
 It has no scientific basis, nor can it be seen from the figures, but the devaluation of the BJP can be seen
 main sweekaar karata hum ki ye baaten maahaul ke aadhaar par hai lekin kai baar maahaul bhavishya kaa andaja de jaataa he
 Now Rahul seems to be in the secondary level, not like cartoons, but he is not even a hero yet
 ve us nai tasviir kii tarah hai, jo dhire-dhire taiyaar ho rahi he or darshak pratyaasha main intjaar kar rahe hai
 There is an ideal kind of situation, but how long can one wait
 sthiti kaaphi had tak spasht he
 Gujarat is like an initiation ceremony for Rahul and he has performed the ritual properly
 ve ab anishchit-se nahin hai, unhone sankraman kaal paar kar liya he
 He will formally lead the Congress after Gujarat
 anushthan ke apane tark hote hai
 Rahul is no longer a teenager
 ve ab aanushthanik rup se ek netaa hai
 If the ritual is done well, it creates a feeling of infection in a person and Gujarat is such a ritual for Rahul
 saamaajik badlaav ullekhneey he
 Rahul's personality and role seems to be changing and now change and reflection will not be easy
 puraane atirek or shikaayatein, jinhen media mudda banaata rahaa he, ab paryaapt nahin hai
 In fact, now people are not looking towards the historic Congress, but towards such a Congress, which makes history
 rahul or puraa desh yah mahasoos kar rahaa he ki ham do bhinn kathankon ke bich khadey hai
 The first plot is about the historic Congress, about the dynastic Congress of Nehru and Indira
 lekin vah ab smriti kaa hissaa he
 Rahul is saying let me draw the new Congress, he is talking about internal democracy, and the ritual of organizational change, which is very close to his heart
 nai peedi ke prabandhan visheshgyon kii tarah rahul maanate hai ki sanghathan main chote badlaav bade parivartan kii peethika hote hai

 The old snakes of Congress will not work
 rahul apni party ke bos nahin ho sakate, jananetaa kahana jaldbaaji hogi, lekin ve samaan logon main pratham honge, unki bhoomika or mahatv spasht he
 The country is waiting for a new style, which will be collective and therefore homogeneous, like a family but beyond the old boundaries of the family
 ek paryvekshak hone ke naate kisi ko shuru main bahut adhik spashtataa kii apeksha nahin kerani chahie
 It will be a mixed Congress, so that it can be both loved and hated
 aisi congress na ho jo smarak dak tikaton kaa sangrah lage
 We can now sarcasm that bye the prince, now the leader came
 ek baat samaj lijie ki aisa nahin he ki congress party main sab kuch thikthak ho gaya
 Rather, as a party, things suddenly go wrong in the BJP and like the old Congress it is not even accepting them
 party ne notebandi se baari gadabad-ghotaalaa kar liya, krishi kshetra kii mushkilon se ankhen pher lee, jabaki kisaanon kii khudakushi or sookhe ke kaaran dehaat main bura haal he
 Rahul Gandhi will have to consider these issues from the perspective of the future
 vastav main unhen itihaas nahin, balki bhavishya ko dhyaan main rakhana hoga
 
 
 They will need to set up a task force on the informal economy and a committee will be formed to understand the agricultural sector, especially from the perspective of farmers, to create a group of thinkers to consider education and environment, that too Modi's policies make them ineffective Before that
 unhen aisi pahal kerani hogi taaki uniwarsity or yuva media, modi yug main jinka hraas hua he, unke sahyogi ban saken
 They will have to build new bridges along with repairing the old areas
 unhen puraane vichaarkon se apil karne kii jarurat nahin he
 They have to keep a new vision, they will have to give new hope to India with new ideas, they will have to give a new education to democracy in the face of old majoritarianism
 ve jaldbaaji nahin kar sakate
 The country can wait decades for them
 ab unki baari he, unhen saavdhaanee ke saath kalpanashiltaa ke saath or duuradrushti ke saath intjaar karnaa chahie
 They have to draw the blueprint of the possibilities for themselves and for a tired but patient India

" lekin isamen bhi unki anubhavheenata ek baar phir se ujagar hui
 On Thursday, there was a lot of uproar in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly over one of his statements
 unhone apane bayaan main andeh jataayaa tha ki unka rajya bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 Opponents strongly opposed his statement
 umr ne to yah bhi kaha ki 1947 main maharaja hari singh ne bharat ke saath kashmir kaa vilay sashart samajhaite ke tahat kiya tha
 At this, the opposition surrounded him saying that the Chief Minister was violating the oath to honor the Constitution of India
 umr ne bhaajapa ke nazariye par bhi sawaal uthaae
 BJP has been saying that there is no longer any dispute to be resolved in the context of Jammu and Kashmir
 umr kii raay main, agar aisa hi hota to phir shimla samajhaite, lahore ghoshnaptr or phir agra or dilli main vaarta kii kya jarurat thi? unki is tarah kii tippaniyon se vipakshi vidhayakon main upje aakrosh par kaabo paane ke liye marshall bulaane pade
 In fact, his reputation and reputation dating back to the days of Omar's ruling have vanished in less than two years
 kashmir ke logon ne apane mukhyamantri ko ummiido par khara nahin paaya he, khaskar unke dada or abba ke mukaable
 sher-e-kashmir Sheikh Abdullah physically (his height was six feet four inches) also dominated Kashmir and also in symbol
 unke bete, chah foot se zyada lambey faruk abdulla yahaan kii avam ke swaabhaavik netaa the
 Omar is incompetent and also unaware of the situation
 vaise to faruk bhi shaikh abdulla ke bete hone kii vajah se hi mukhyamantri bane the
 But after becoming a Gaddinshin, he loved to be surrounded by visitors, partymen, bureaucrats and common people who came to work all the time

 assi ke dashak main srinagar se thodi dur par ek gaanv main jate vakt dhar or faruk ko ek bujurg kashmiri ne roka
 Dhar did not want to stop but Farooq stopped the train and met him
 unhone kaha, ''mere abbu hameshaa ruk kar usase milte the
 Later, Farooq took Dhar lying in Pasopesh to feed him rotis and feed him salty tea
 vahaan mulakatiyon or darkhaastiyon kii bheed lagi thi
 The elder instructed Farooq to give all the applications
 shaikh abdulla ke bete ne un sari argiyon ko lekar unke kaam karne kaa vaada kiya
 They may not have been able to do the work of everyone, but they used to keep their respect by staying among the people
 faruk ke paanch baar ke kaarykaal ko kashmir ke sabase bhrasht kaarykalon ke rup main mana jaataa he
 Omar is considered to be immaculate compared to him personally
 lekin srinagar main unke is pahalu par to koi baat hi nahin karata
 Syed Ali Shah Geelani, his staunch enemy and supporter of terrorism in Kashmir, realized this deviation much earlier
 unka kahana he, ''abdulla khandaan 1938 se hi kashmiriyon ko dhokhaa detaa aa rahaa he
 At that time, he changed the name of the Muslim Conference to National Conference to get closer to the Nehru family
 ''ve aage jodate hai, ''bomai or shopiyaan prakaran ke baad umr ko istipha de dena chahie tha
 He says that his heart fell to 120 pieces
 phir aakhir ve jinda kaise hai?'' unka maananaa he ki abdulla parivaar apni lokapriyata kho chukaa he or soobe main ab uskaa koi vajood nahin he
 The National Conference is also discouraged and is now being feared for its overthrow
 khufia sutron kaa kahana he ki iske bahut-se kaaryakarta patharbaji main shaamil hai
 Omar also does not have many friends in the party
 yahaan tak ki unke abbu bhi 2010 main khud mukhyamantri banane kii ummid paale hue the
 a silent challenge is emerging for the Abdullah family in the Lunjpunj party
 haalanki umr ise mahaj afvaah qaraar dete hai
 Young leaders such as Rahim Rathor, Chaudhary Mohammad Ramadan and Sakina Ittu do not depend on the miracle of Abdullah blurring for their mass support

 Sarabara Mehbooba Mufti of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) reveals her loneliness by accusing Saeed Omar of strangling the expectations of January 2009, saying "any protest if you take the money for stoning with money If you do justice, then you are inviting destruction only

 "mehbooba is speaking unilaterally and biased, but these things of her are not completely wrong either

 Loss of centre ne haalanki hinduon ke saath baatcheet se rasta to nikaala lekin is prakriya main kashmiri swabhimaan ko gahari chot pahunchi
 Umar did not do any work of healing even at that time
 kashmiriyon main unke prati nafrat panpane kii yah ek badi vajah bana or ab ve unhen apane bich kaa nahin maanate
 In Mehbooba's opinion, he got Rs 2,400 crore for the state
 kaa relif package mila
 He had to do all the sports on that
 ''aazaadee ke liye hone vaale pradarshnon kaa alag-alag vakton main alag-alag matlab rahaa he

 In February 2009, two civilians were killed in an army shootout in Bomai when Umar was skiing with his family in Gulmarg, in Alfaaz, Mehbooba
 rajyapal ne phone par unase baat karne kii koshish kii lekin sari koshishen naakaam raheen
 Fearing Omar once again in the face of accusations, Mehbooba says that during his visit to Shopian in June, Omar tried to get him killed by party goons
 yah vahi vakt tha jab do mahilaon ke laapata ho jane ke baad vahaan logon kaa gussa foot padaa tha
 The bodies of both were later recovered from a canal
 lekin salwator pheragamo juuton or paneraai ghadiyon ke shaukeen umr ne badi maasoomiyat ke saath yah soch liya ki pradarshnakariyon kii maang ke silsile main dikhaave kii karrwai hi kaaphi he
 That is to remove the police post from Bomai and take action against the policemen involved in the incident
 unhen apane dushman kii dur-dur tak koi thaah hi nahin thi
 Raising their hands in this way only encouraged the freedom fighters
 duusari taraf police kaa manobal bhi tutaa
 So is he going to be the last Abdullah to rule? In the sun-bathed verandah of his residence on Gupkar Road, Omar smiles with a full heart and says, "at the moment everyone is trying to whip me
 thik he, aisa hi sahi
 "the Center believes that if violence erupted in Kashmir during US President Barack Obama's visit to India in November, it would bring disrepute to India around the world
" america videsh vibhaag ne ghati main logon ke mood kii thaah lene ke liye apane do pratinidhi yahaan bheje
 The whispers are heard that the Congress would like to make Kashmir Finance Minister Rahim Rather as the next Chief Minister
 iskaa khaas arth he
 Regarding Rathar, Mehbooba also says that he is elected on his own, not being of the National Conference
 aise main congress kaa maananaa he ki rathar ko chunane se kashmir ke yuvaaon or yahaan ke netaaon main yah sandesh jayega ki umr par ab bharat kaa bharosa nahin rahaa
 The pictures on the walls of Omar here are reminiscent of a quiet past
 lekin khud unke chehre par bhavishya kaa koi sanket najar nahin aata

 At the same time, its taste also deteriorates
 frij main rakhi bread sehat ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaati he
 Potato: Keeping potato in very cold temperature changes the starch present in it
 jo sehat ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Especially diabetes patients should avoid eating potatoes kept in the fridge

 Which does not taste good in honey
 isko room temparechar par rakhana hi behatar hota he

 Because of which coffee kept in the fridge is not drinkable

 Keeping a banana in the fridge causes the banana to blacken very quickly and its taste changes as well

 You will be surprised to know that the people of Deoghar, the city of Baba Vaidyanath, are familiar with computers since 1945-46 and the Land Registration Department here was computerized during this time
 devgarh jile main pichley 12 saal se chal rahi jameen kii avaidh kharid-farokht kaa maamla saamne aane ke baad se is tarah ke ajeebogareeb khulaase ho rahe hai
 It has been reported that the land mafia has about 771 in connivance with the administration
 59 acre gaiyr bikri yogya jameen ko bech daalaa jabaki santhal pargana kaashtakaari adhinium ke tahat is jameen ko bechney par kadi pabandi he
 The scam amounted to Rs 1,000 crore according to the administration's own estimate
 ke kareeb he
 In these 12 years, 12 Deputy Commissioners, 11 sps, 14 Additional Deputy Commissioners, 11 dclrs were deployed in Deoghar but none of the eyes went towards this scam
 baharhaal devgarh ke vartmaan upayukta (disi) mast ram meena, jinhone is ghotaale kaa khulaasa kiya, ne sarkaar ko bheje gopneey patr main is puure maamle kii nigaraanee vibhaag se jaanch kii sifarish kar di or kaha ki prashasnic madad ke bina is tarah ke ghotaale ko anjaam nahin diya ja saktaa
 But Jharkhand Chief Minister Arjun Munda has recommended a CBI inquiry into the entire matter
 unhone kaha, ''yah ek bada ghotaalaa he or isamen antarraji giroh kaa haath hone se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In the immediate action, the police have arrested Sunil Poddar, an employee in the Deoghar Archives and Dhruv Parhast, a businessman of the land, and sent him to jail
 police ko ek anya jameen kaarobaari sanjay singh kii bhi talash he
 The mafia's audacity can also be understood that last month, when DC put all the documents related to these cases in the trunk and sealed them, the land mafia secretly stolen all these seized documents in the fire of the night of September 1
 Surrendered
 ab sachaai saamne aa rahi he to pataa chalaa he ki devgarh anchal sahit madhupur or mohanpur anchal ghotaale ke sabase bade centre bindu the
 The manner in which this scam was carried out is also no less interesting
 sambandhit jameen ke puraane or asli nakshe ko computerikrut nakshe se badal diya gaya or badlaav kii tithi 1945-46 saal he jabaki us samay computer kaa koi ata-pataa tak nahin tha
 For example, Mauja Madhusudan 3 of Deoghar
 27 acre parati gaiyr majarua jameen, jo gaiyr bikri yogya shrenee main aati he, se sambandhit dastavej main computerikrut nakshaa chaspaan kar diya gaya
 Fake documents were replaced, disappearing the original documents
 rajasav karmchaaree ne raseed sankhya 607947, 2009 ke jariye 35 varshon kaa lagaan vasuuli dikhaa kar use bikri yogya bana diya
 Investigation has revealed that non-salable ground papers were extensively tampered with in Index-2
 kahin-kahin to bhu-mafia ne bhoomi kaa puraa kaa puraa byora hi badal diya
 It is not that in these years the officials have no knowledge of these disturbances
 devgarh jahaan kii sirf 10 fisadi jameen hi bikri yogya shrenee main aati he, vahaan pichley 10 saal main jameen bikri main oochaal khud main hi andeh paidaa karti he
 There were about 4009 registries in Deoghar during 2010-11
 10 saal pehle kii tulana main yah oochaal 20 guna he
 5 in the small district of Deoghar this year only
 6 karod ru

 86 karod ru

 20 karod ru
 Registration fee of Rs
 lekin kisi ne iske peeche jane kii jarurat mahasoos nahin kii
 This is not the first land scam in Jharkhand
 lekin agar rajya sarkaar sakhti se pesh aati to shaayad aaj baat kuch or hi hoti
 The investigation of about 400 acres of land scam in Ranchi has been in cold storage since 2000
 is ghotaale se devgarh kaa panda samaaj kaaphi aahat or rosh main he

 The formation of a BJP government for the first time in the North East is also important for the party's interest in many ways because the way the party's vote percentage has increased in the elections of West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, it will be given to Amit Shah for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 gambhir ne kaha, salaami jodi ke taur par hamaara ausat ab bhi 53 kaa he, jo mujhe lagata he ki vishwa cricket main salaami ballebaaji ke taur par sarvshereshth main se ek he
 There are not many opening pairs playing for such a long time, which average 53 in each innings
 agar 53 kaa ausat hi kaaphi nahin he, to main nahin jaanata ki kya kaaphi he
 "as an opening pair you make an average of 50 in each innings and if you are starting with 50 runs in each innings, you cannot do more than that
 main unhen aankade dekhne kaa suzav duungaa
 The average of 53 is fantastic
 beete samay main kaaphi salaami jodiyaan itnaa ausat nahin bana saki hai or aaj bhi nahin bana rahi hai

 26 ausat se ran banaae hai, jo test main unke kariyar ke ausat 50
 Well below 64

 It is not that i have not scored a century, there are many other players who have not scored a hundred
 gambhir ne kaha, log sirf shatak ke bare main charchaa karte hai, main nahin jaanata ki aisa kyon he
 i scored 93 in South Africa
 australia main 85 ke kareeb ran jutaaye the
 Gambhir scored his last century against Bangladesh in January 2010
 unhone kaha, jab aap pari shuru karte hai, to aap kitna yogadan karte hai, yah dekha jaataa he
 "our average as an opening pair is still 53, which i think is one of the best as an opener in world cricket," Gambhir said
 itane lambey samay tak khilne vaali zyada salaami jodiyaan nahin hai, jinka prayek pari main 53 kaa ausat ho
 If the average of 53 is not enough, then i do not know what is enough
 unhone kaha, salaami jodi ke rup main aap prayek pari main 50 kaa ausat banaate ho or agar aap prayek pari main 50 ran se shuruyaat kara rahe ho, to aap isse zyada nahin kar sakate
 i would suggest them to look at the figures

 The Congress does not want to give up any core efforts to win the political battle of Gujarat
 iske liye wo gujarat kii trimurti ko gale lagane kii kavayad main juty he
 Recently after joining Alpesh Thakor with her, she is now bargaining with Hardik Patel, while Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani is also struggling
 congress unhen apane saath jodne kii puri taiyaari kar chuki he
 If Jignesh is on the Congress's footsteps, he can prove to be a profitable deal for the party in other states than Gujarat
 trimurti ko congress kaa nyotagujrat chunaav kii ghoshnaa hone se pehle hi congress upaadhyaksharahul gandhi bada daanv khel diya tha
 The Congress invited OBC leader Alpesh Thakor, Patidar leader Hardik Patel and Dalit leader Jignesh Mewani to come together to fight the elections against BJP
 is nyote ko sweekaar karte hue sabase pehle alpesh thakor ne congress kaa daaman thama
 Hardik Patel, the leader of the Patidar Anamat movement, also seems to agree with the Congress
 jignesh ko saath jodne ke liye bhi congress ne apane saare ghode khol die hai
 Jignesh Mevani is in Delhi
 mana ja rahaa he ki rahul gandhi se mulaakaat karke wo congress kaa daaman tham lenge
 Jignesh Mevani, identified with the Dalit movement, suddenly came into the limelight when he administered the oath of not lifting dead animals and scavenging to 20,000 Dalits in the 'azadi Kooch Andolan' after the Una incident in Veraval
 jignesh ne us samay kaha tha- 'is muhim main ham har shahar, gali or gaanv main jaakar bahujan samaaj ke logon ko shapath dilaa rahe hai ki ve log apni puraani varna vyavastha par aadhaarit pesha choden or baba sahib ambedkar ke bataae raste par chalakar shikshit bane or apane paanv par khadey hon'
 Keep Jignesh's tail outside Krajgeya, even outside Gujarat and give us the slogan like 'give us our land', Jignesh Mevani got recognition not only from Gujarat but also from the Dalit movement
 jignesh pehle gujarat kii sadakon par utre or phir dilli se lekar uttar pradesh, rajasthan, jharkhand tak dalit maamalon ko lekar aawaaj uthaai
 Also joined hands with those taking up different Dalit matters of the country
 upi main chandrashekhar, dilli main professor ratan laal ke saath wo najar aae
 Dalits are less in Gujarat, more than 7 percent of Dalit voters in Gujarat and the number of Dalits in the country is 15 percent
 dalit matadaataaon ke bade tabake ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ke paksh main matdaan kiya tha
 To understand this, look at the results of UP, BJP had won all the 14 reserved seats here
 isi saal uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main bhi usne anusuchit jati-janajati ke liye arakshit 86 main se 76 siton par jeet darj kii
 At the same time in 2014, despite being second in the BSP vote share, it could not win a single seat while in the assembly elections it was reduced to 19 seats
 jignesh mewaani yuva or tej-tarraar hai
 They can play an important role in bringing back the Dalit votes not only in Gujarat but also in the country
 maujuuda daur main congress dalit yuva chehron kii kami se jujh rahi he
 Only Ashok Tanwar is seen in the name of Dalit face, but he does not have much support base
 aise main oona andolan ke jariye pahchaan banane vaale jignesh main congress ko ummid dikh rahi he
 Congress can use Jignesh not only in Gujarat but also in the politics of the country
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi dalit maton kii ahm bhoomika rahegi, jisamen jignesh congress ke liye madadgaar sabit ho sakate hai

 47 karod The agustawestland deal has once again exposed the pressure to implicate former Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her advisor and Rajya Sabha MP Ahmed Patel
 agasta deal ke kathith bicholie chrishchiyan mishael ne dubai main jamaanat milane ke baad bataaya ki unpar aisa karne ke liye bhartiya adhikariyon ne dabaav banaaya tha
 Michel missed bail on Monday after being arrested in Dubai last year
 mishael ne india today se baatcheet main khulaasa kiya ki unhen 'family' or 'AP' kaa matlab 'gandhi family' or rajyasabha saansad 'ahamed patel' bataane ke liye kaha gaya
 Not only this, Michelle also accused the Indian investigative authorities of trying to sign the false confession
 sibiai adhikariyon se 3 baar milasibiai adhikariyon se mulaakaat par chrishchiyan mishael ne kaha ki vah bhartiya adhikariyon se teen baar mili hai or hotel kii sisitivi footage se aisa sabit bhi kar sakate hai
 Accusing the CBI of lying, Mitchell has also claimed to have 6 witnesses of their meeting
 bataa den ki isse pehle jab mishael ke vakil ne is deal main sonia gandhi kaa naam ghaseetne ke liye dabaav banane kaa aarope lagaaya tha tab sibiai kii taraf se mishael se kabhi na milane kii safai di gai thi
 Mitchell's lawyer claims that members of the Indian investigation team also forced him to confess that he personally knew Sonia Gandhi during the chopper deal
 bataa den ki chrishchiyan mishael par agasta westland helicopter deal main kathith rishwatakhori main ahm bhoomika nibhaane kaa aarope he
 In the ed's charge sheet, Mitchell, a British citizen, is accused of playing a key role in the Euro 60 million kickbacks scandal in the agustawestland bribery scandal
 jaanchakartaaon ke mutabik 1997 se 2013 ke bich mishael ne bharat ke 300 daure kiye the
 Christian Michel was also named among the middlemen named in the chargesheet filed by the ED in a United Arab Emirates (UAE) court
 philhal, mishael ko jamaanat mil gai he
 On the other hand, the Indian government is trying to bring Mitchell to India
 congress ne diya tha ye javabamishel ke vakil ke khulaase par congress ne kaha tha ki bharat sarkaar kii kathputliyaan, sibiai or idi, chrishchiyan mishael or anya sandigdhon ke khilaaf saboot nahin juta pain, lekin ve pradhanmantri modi ke raajnneetik virodhiyon ke khilaaf gandi sajeesh ke liye mishael ke istemaal kii koshish kar rahi hai
 This is the first time that such a conspiracy has also been exposed internationally
 congress kaa ye bhi kahana he ki farvari 2013 main 12 helicopter kii kharid ke liye 3,546 karod rupye ke agasta westland contract ko radd kar diya gaya tha
 Also, a CBI inquiry was ordered into the entire case
