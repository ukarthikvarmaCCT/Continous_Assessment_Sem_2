 Congress MP N, embroiled in controversies over the alleged misconduct of Malayalam cinema actress Shweta Menon at a function on Friday evening
 pitaambara kurup ne aise kisi bhi krity kaa joardaar khandan kiya he
 The 73-year-old Kurup, who represents Kollam in the Lok Sabha, told the media, "this is completely untrue
" is ghatana ke silsile main media ke ek hisse main meraa naam aane ke baad main aisa kah rahaa hum
 Shweta said without naming her abuser on Friday that she was abused at the venue of the President's Trophy Boat Racing
 media ke footage main dikhaaya gaya ki kurup unhen chhu rahe hai, jiske baad saansad ne bayaan jari kiya
 The MP said on Saturday that it is very sad that his name was dragged into this unfortunate incident and he will prove himself innocent with strong evidence
 unhone kaha, philhal ise sirf raajnneeti se prerit mana janaa chahie, jab chunaav najadik aa rahe hai
 It is sad that a malicious attack can be carried out against me just by being a leader
 ghatana kii malayalam film se jude logon or mahilaon ne kadi ninda kii he or ghatana ke khilaaf kadi karrwai karne kii maang kii he
 Police has not registered a case in this regard yet
 shuukravaar ko relies hui diarector mohit suri kii film 'half garlfriend' main pehali baar arjuna kapur or shraddha kapur kii jodi saath najar aa rahi he
 Apart from Arjun and Shraddha, Vikrant Massey and Seema Biswas are also seen in this film
 film kii kahani madhav jha ke kirdaar se shuru hoti he jo patna ke ek gaanv se dilli ke saint stephen college main daakhila lene aata he par angreji main kamjor hone ke chalate use pareshaani jhelni padati he
 Eventually, he gets admission in college due to his spot reply and sports quota
 tippaniyan It is in this college that Madhav meets Riya i
e
 Shraddha Kapoor, who is the daughter of a rich family
 madhav or riya ke bich dosti kaa kaaran banati he basket bal
 They both come from different environments of the society, but still they become friendships, which Madhav wants to bring to the end of the marriage but Riya does not want to make any haste in this relationship
 lekin jab madhav ke poochne par wo kahati he kii wo uski 'half garlfriend' he
 Now what happens in this next and whether or not this half-girlfriend becomes Madhav's full girlfriend or not, you will only know by watching the film
 film kii kuch khoobiyon or kuch khaamiyon kii baat karen to kamiyon main sabase pehle kamjor he isaki kahani jisamen kuch nayaapan nahin he
 The film is based on the novel 'half Girlfriend' by writer Chetan Bhagat
 is tarah kii kahani kai filmon main aap pehle dekh chuke hai
 Many times it happens that even though the story is old, the screen play of the film, its moments and direction makes the film impressive but it has not been done here either
 film main clice bahut hai yani bahut si paristhitiyaan or ghatnaayen aisi hai jinamein aapako kuch nayaa yaa alag najar nahin aayega
 i would also like to throw light on the character of Shraddha Kapoor, which i felt a bit confused in the film
 ab ye chook nirdeshak se hui yaa khud shraddha se, yah kahana mushkil he
 Talking about the goodness of the film, Yun To Yeh Love Story Hai, but the filmmaker has also emphasized on issues like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao and social toilets and there should be toilets for girls in schools, which is a good message
 arjuna kapur kii agar baat karu to wo apane kirdaar ke prati mujhe eemaandaar najar aae or unke saath-saath vikrant kaa bhi kaam acha he
 Another unique feature of this film is its song writing and music which i both like
 kuch seens aapke dilon ko chhu sakate hai jaise train kaa ek seen jo arjuna or shraddha ke bich he yaa phir arjuna ke kirdaar kaa riya ko paaglon kii tarah dhundhna
 The decision to watch or not to watch the film is in your hands, but we get this film from our side

 5 stars isi college main madhav kii mulaakaat hoti he riya yani shraddha kapur se jo ek amir parivaar se kii beti hai
 Basket hair causes friendship between Madhav and Riya
 ye dono samaaj ke alag alag parivesh se aate hai par phir bhi inaki dosti ho jaati he, jise madhav shaadi ke anjaam tak pahunchaana chahta he lekin riya is rishte main koi jaldbaaji nahin karnaa chaahati
 But when Madhav asks, she says that he is her 'half-girlfriend'
 ab aage isamen kya hota he or yah half garlfriend madhav kii phul garlfriend ban paati he yaa nahin, yah to aapako film dekhakar hi pataa chalegaa
 Talking about some of the film's merits and some shortcomings, the first among the shortcomings is weak, its story which has no newness
 yah film lekhak chetan bhagat ke noval 'half garlfriend' par hi aadhaarit he
 You have seen this type of story in many films before
 kai baar aisa bhi hota he ki kahani bhale hi puraani ho par film kaa screen play, uske moments or nirdesan film ko prabhaavshaalee bana detaa he par yahaan aisa bhi nahin ho paaya he
 There are lots of cliches in the film, that is, there are many situations and events in which you will not see anything new or different
 main shraddha kapur ke kirdaar par bhi roshni daalana chaahunga, jo mujhe film main thodaa canafujd laga
 Now it is difficult to say whether this mistake happened to the director or to the reverence itself
 film kii achchhaayiyon kii baat karen to yun to ye lav story he par filmkaar ne saamaajik jimmedaari nibhaate hue beti bachaao beti padhaao or skulon main ladakiyon ke liye shauchalae hone chahie jaise muddon par bhi jor diya he, jo acha sandesh he
 If i talk about Arjun Kapoor, he will be honest to me about his character and along with him Vikrant's work is also good
 is film kii ek or khubi he iske gane kii likhaai or sangeet jo dono hi mujhe pasand aae
 Some scenes can touch your heart like a train scene between Arjun and Shraddha or finding Arjun's character Riya like crazy
 film dekhne yaa na dekhne kaa faisla aapke haathon main he par hamaari taraf se is film ko milte hai

 srilanka ke aakraamak openar ballebaaj tillakaratne dilashaan ne pakistan ke khilaaf hambantota main chal rahe vanade international match main apni 62 ranon kii pari ke dauraan vanade cricket main 10 hajaar ran bhi puure kar liye
 With this, Dilshan became the fifth player in the world to take 10,000 runs and 100 wickets in odis
 yah baat alag he ki sabase tej 10 hajaar ran banane kaa record sachin tendulkar ke naam he, jise dilashaan tod nahin paae
 Sachin's name is record-wise Dilshan has scored a total of 10,007 runs in 293 innings of 319 matches so far
 aapako bataa den ki vanade maichon main sabase kam pariyon main 10 hajaar ran banane kaa record master blaster sachin tendulkar ke naam he
 Tendulkar had played only 259 innings to complete his 10,000 runs
 top par hai sachinvanade international cricket main 10,000 yaa isse adhik ran banane vaale ballebaajon main bharat ke sachin tendulkar ne sabase zyada 18,426 banaae hai jabaki 14,234 ranon ke saath duusare number par hai srilanka ke kumaar sangakaara, purv australian captain riki ponting ne 13,704 banaae hai, srilanka ke purv openar sanath jayasoorya ne kul 13,430 ran, jabaki lankai middle order kii jaan rahe purv captain mahela jayavardhane ne vanade main 12,650 ran banaae hai

 -input language sarkari companiyon kii bikri (nijeekaran) kaa faisla gambhir he
 This is a retreat from the policy of mixed economy
 sarkari upakramon ko bechney se bajet main kuch sansaadhan aaenge lekin yah to sabji kaa bill chukaane ke liye ghar ko bechney jaisaa he
 It is very unfortunate that the government is thinking of selling Air India and Indian Airlines
 main kabhi soch bhi nahin saktaa jo vimaanan companiyaan hamaara jhanda duniya main le jaati hai, unhen bechaa jayega

 This speech was against the privatization policy of the Vajpayee government which he had prepared for the Congress session (march 2001) in Bangalore
 bhaashan to nahin ho sakaa lekin adhiveshan ke dauraan unhone jairam ramesh se charchaa main nijeekaran par vaajapeyi sarkaar kii niti ke virodh main gaharaa kshobh prakat kiya tha
 This memoir and speech article are compiled in Ramesh's book To the Thinking and back-india's 1991 Story
 sarkari upakramon ko lekar narsingh raav ke aagrah das saal chali manmohan sarkaar ko bhi baandhe rahe
 Now, in the Modi government too, the loss-ridden postal department is being converted into a payment bank or some public sector undertakings are being made in some areas including steel, it will have to be believed that the love of Indian leaders regarding government companies is not just economic arguments, but party Even beyond the boundaries
 sarkaar bank, hotel, bijli ghar hi nahin chalaati, balki steel, chemicals, urvarak, tipahiyaa scooter bhi banaati he, or vah bhi ghate par
 The government has 290 companies, which are under 41 central ministries
 bank inke alaava hai
 234 companies are operating while 56 are under construction
 sakriy 234 sarkari companiyon main 17
 4 lakh crore Rs
 kaa saarvajanik dhan laga he
 Their total production is 20
 6 lakh karod ru
 is
 sakriy companiyon main 71 upkram ghate main hai
 The total profit from psus is about Rs 1,46,164 crore
 he yani inamen lagi puunji par lagbhag utana ritern aata he jitna byaaj sarkaar karjon par chukaati he
 Two-thirds of the profits of public sector undertakings come from coal, oil, power generation and distribution where the government has a monopoly, or from areas where the major natural resources or market share of government companies are cheap before private competition comes
 i had received it or free
 saarvajanik upakramon kaa kul ghaataa 1,19,230 karod ru
 is
 yadi bainkon ke taaja ghate or fanse hue karj mila len to sankhya daraane lagati he
 There are 863 state-owned companies in which 215 are loss-making
 jab hamen yah pataa ho ki nijee kshetra ke echdiefasi bank kaa kul bazaar mulya ek darjan sarkari bainkon se zyada he yaa reliance industries kii bazaar kii keemat indian oil, bharat petroleum, gail or hindustan petroleum se adhik he to aarthik paimaanon par sarkari companiyon ko banaae rakhane kaa thos tark nahin banataa
 High positions in government companies that remain vacant for months indicate that their administrative setup is also difficult
 rojgaar ke tark bhi tikaoo nahin hai
 The organized sector (government and private) accounts for only six per cent of the employment market
 keval 1
 76 crore people were in the government sector, of which 13
 5 lakh log sarkari companiyon main hai
 Previous experiments have proved that employment did not decrease with disinvestment and privatization
 in tathyon ke baavjood or apane chunavi bhaashanon main minimum government kii alakh jagaane vaali modi sarkaar nae saarvajanik upkram banane lagati he to hairat bad jaati he
 For example, take the payment bank of the postal department
 2015 main dak vibhaag kaa ghaataa 14 fisadi badhkar 6,259 karod ru
 Arrived
 khaataa kholkar jamaa nikasi kii suvidha dene vaale dak ghar arse se pement bank jaisaa hi kaam karte hai
 Only loans are not available which even new payment banks cannot provide
 sarkari bank badahaal hai or nijee companiyaan pement bank license lautaa rahi hai
 When future financial transactions take place not from bank branches but from ATM mobiles and online, the postal department gets Rs 800 crore
 kii puunji lagaakar ek nayaa bank banane kii baat gale nahin utarati
 The discrepancy is further exacerbated when the NITI Aayog is working on the recommendations of disinvestment of government companies, including Air India
 sarkaar ko kaarobaar main banaae rakhane ke aagrah aarthik yaa rojgarparak nahin balki rajnatik hai
 With the decentralization of power and the emergence of independent regulators, the space for discretionary decisions for politicians is limited
 adhikaron ke sikudde ke is daur main keval sarkari companiyaan hi bachi hai jo raajnneeti kii prabhutvvaadi aakankshaon ko aadhaar detii hai jinamein bhrashtachar kii paryaapt gunjaaish bhi he
 This is the reason why Narasimha Rao, who gave economic reform to India, finds privatization as a sin
 manmohan singh das saal ke shashan main saarvajanik upakramon kaa vinievesh nahin kar pate hai, jabaki nijee kshetra kii ummiido ke nayak narendra modi sarkari companiyon ke nae praneta ban jate hai
 In this list of Prime Ministers, only Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who runs a coalition government, looked courageous
 unhone nijeekaran kii niti banaai or lagbhag 28 companiyon ke nijeekaran ke saath yah sabit kiya ki hotel chalaanaa yaa bread bananaa sarkaar kaa kaam nahin he
 Citizens' money is invested in public companies
 jab ye companiyaan ghate main hoti hai to siddhanthata yah rashtriya sampatti kii haani he
 As seen in the public sector banks, where the money from the budget is also sinking and the money of depositors is also there, but if this damage is used for political domination, then who will worry? We must recognize that the urge to retain government companies has become a sacrament of Indian politics by breaking party barriers, from which early liberation is now impossible

 Both legs are broken, the body is full of scratches and the solicitation in the eyes will rip the bottom of the heart

 Morning turns into afternoon, afternoon becomes evening and evening again turns into night, but neither the hope of heart breaks nor the thirst to live with eyes

 unhone kaha ki grahamantri ke rup main adwani ke record ko dhyaan main rakhkar desh ko yah tay karnaa chahie ki adwani kya pradhanmantri banane laayak hai
 Describing Advani as an opportunist, he said that the saffron leader had praised the founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah during his visit to Pakistan 4 years ago
 manmohan singh ne kaha- main kamjor pradhanmantri hum yaa majboot, hamaari sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj is bare main vistaar se bayaan karata he
 He said that Advani repeatedly accused him of being a weak prime minister, but everyone knows that he played a major role in the Babri Masjid demolition and during the NDA government there were terror attacks on Parliament and Red Fort and an Indian Airlines plane was attacked by terrorists

 Geeta, who was brought to India from Pakistan two years ago, suddenly mysteriously disappeared from the deaf center of Indore on Thursday
 use vahaan skim number 71 main sthit 'def and damb byalingual acedemi' main rakhaa gaya tha
 The disappearance of Geeta stirred up the center
 tatkaal police ko soochna di gai
 The police later recovered him from a temple
 gita ke laapata ho jane ke baad indore shahar ke teen thanon kii policegitako dhundne main lag gai
 It is a matter of honor that the police of Chandan Nagar police station found Geeta after hard work in the evening from ranjit-hanuman temple
 phir use mook-badhir centre ke hostel main pahunchaaya gaya
 On why Gita took this step, the operators of the deaf center have kept silence
 edishnal espi roopesh dvivedi ne gita ke kuch der laapata rahane ke baad police kii ore se use dhund nikaalane kii pushti kii
 When asked the reason, he said that he cannot say anything on this, but there must be some reason why Geeta went out of the center
 bataa den ki gita ko ahm jimmedaari ke tahat mook-badhir sanghathan ko saunpa gaya tha
 Geeta returned to India from Pakistan on 26 October 2015
 iske kareeb teen maheene ke baad 7 farvari 2016 ko gita kii photo ke saath videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne ek twit kiya tha
 The tweet wrote that "geeta is happy in Indore
 ham uske parivaar ko dhundne main koi kasar nahin chhod rahe hai
 "geeta returned from Pakistan with the hope that she would find her family
 lekin itnaa samay bitne ke baad bhi gita kaa parivaar nahin dhundha ja sakaa
 Here the question arises as to why Geeta went out of the silent-deaf center on Thursday without telling her
 kya wo yahaan rahete hue naakhush he? police ne itnaa hi kaha he ki koi vajah to rahi hogi
 According to Additional SP Rupesh Dwivedi, it is beyond the scope of the police to talk about the operation of the deaf center
 jaankaree jutaney ke liye jab media mook badhir centre main shuukravaar subah pahunchaa to ko jimmedaar vyakti baat karne ke liye saamne nahin aayaa
 An attendant then loudly asked him to turn off the camera and exit the center gate
 gita ke centre se baahar jane kii vajah koi bhi ho lekin centre kaa is tarah kaa ravaiya sawaal jarur khadey karata he
 Geetha's 15-year-old Geetha was found at the railway station in the Samjhauta Express by Pakistani Rangers at the age of 7-8

 Efforts by human rights organizations to find Geeta's family began
 bharat ucchayog kii ore se bheji gai ek tasviir main gita ne apane pita, sauteli maa or bhai bahanon kii pahchaan kii thi
 a person hailing from Bihar claimed Geeta as her daughter
 haalanki gita bharat lautne ke baad apane parivaar ko pahchaan nahin saki
 It was then clear from the government that Geeta would be handed over to her family only after DNA matching was confirmed
 jab tak uskaa parivaar dhund nahin liya jaataa use surakshit aashray main rakhaa jayega
 Geeta is almost 25 years old now
 aapako bataa den ki kareeb do saal pehle pakistan se gita naam kii mook-badhir ladki ko bharat laae jane kii ghatana bahut surkhiyon main rahi thi
 The efforts of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj played an important role in bringing Geeta to India

 Facebook user and Major Surendra Punia, who received a Distinguished Service Medal for his outstanding contribution to the army, has claimed that Congress President Rahul Gandhi had manipulated the figures while announcing the justice plan
 fasebuk pej“ghar ghar modi”ne to rahul ke isi press conference kii do sampadit video clips post kar congress ko gheraa
 The India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that these claims are misleading
 ye viral fasebuk post ek press conference ke do hisson ko jodakar taiyaar kii gai he
 When we listened carefully to the video posted, we found that the clip of 25 seconds posted by Major Surendra Punia has been prepared by joining two parts of a press conference together
 pehle bhaag main rahul kehete hai- “main aapako bataanaa chahta hum
 i want to tell the people of the country, i want to tell the poor of India that the line will be 12 thousand rupees, 12 thousand rupees a month
 ”is clip ke duusare hisse main rahul kehete hai- “desh ke 20 fisadi garib pariwaron ko 72,000 hajaar rupee milenge”
 Facebook user claimed that Rahul Gandhi, who promised to give 12 thousand rupees every month to the poor, should give 1 lakh 44 thousand every year, but he is saying that he should give only 72 thousand
 rahul ke “ganit” par sawaal uthaate hue wo poochhate hai ki baaki ke 72000 rupee koun degaa
 Facebook page Ghar Ghar Modi also posted the same video clip but it said "scam started before the scheme starts", more than 1700 people shared it till the news was written
 ham aapako bataa den ki rahul gandhi ne somvaar ko nyaay yojana kaa elaan kiya tha jiske tahat agar congress kii satta main vaapasi hoti he to har bharatvasi ko minimum basic inakam kii guarantee milegi
 This is a top up scheme under which the family income will be increased
 apane press conference ke duusare hisse main rahul ne vistaar se bataaya ki agar ek parivaar 6 hajaar rupee kamata he to sarkaar kii ore se 6000 rupee kii madad kii jaaegi yani har garib kii aamadani ko kam se kam 12 hajaar rupee kiya jayega
 Clearly Rahul never said that 12 thousand would be given to every poor family

 goa main bijepi ne lagata he sankat ko philhal taal diya he
 It was earlier reported that instead of BJP Manohar Parrikar in Goa, Minister Shripad Nayak will be sent to the Center
 magar bijepi netritv isaki himmat nahin juta paaya kyonki goa main bijepi kii sahyogi maharashtravaadi gomantak party or goa pipuls party ne saaf manaa kar diya tha ki unka sarmathan manohar parrikar ko he naa ki bijepi ko
 In such a situation, the BJP high command has now decided that Manohar Parrikar will remain the chief minister and some ministers have been removed and two new faces have been brought
 goa main milind nayak or nilesh kabraal ko mantri banaaya gaya he
 Actually, strange circumstances have arisen for the BJP in Goa
 mukhyamantri manohar parrikar khud biimaar hai or dilli main ames main bhartee hai jahaan unke penkriyaaj kaa ilaaj kiya ja rahaa he
 Apart from Parrikar, two other BJP ministers are quite ill
 padurang madgaikar or francis disuja kii haalat bhi thik nahin he
 One is in America and the other is undergoing treatment in Mumbai and under any circumstances could not come for the assembly voting
 aise main bijepi ko laga ki yadi nayaa mukhyamantri banaaya jaataa he to use bahumat ke liye vishwaas mat hasil karnaa padegaa jiskaa jokhim bijepi nahin lenaa chaahati thi
 On the other hand, Vijay Sardesai of Goa Forward Party, bjp's ally in Goa, was constantly being pressurized that the functioning of the Goa government was being affected in the absence of Manohar Parrikar
 aise main bijepi alaakaman ke liye kuch bhi tay karne ke liye dabaab badhata ja rahaa tha
 Several names were discussed, apart from Shripad Nayak, the name of Goa Assembly Speaker Pramod Sawant was also discussed but the matter could not be made
 halaat ko dekhte hue congress ne bhi apana daanv khel diya congress jiske paas 16 vidhayak hai or unhen ek ensipi ke vidhayak kaa bhi sarmathan hasil he ne sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kar diya or vidhansabha kaa satr bulaane kii maang kar di
 In such a situation, the BJP was becoming increasingly under pressure
 bijepi kii duvidha thi ki wo nayaa mukhyamantri nahin bana sakate the
 On the other hand, Parrikar's condition was not good, the party's options were becoming less
 aise main bijepi ko laga ki abhi goa main jo rajnatik halaat banate ja rahe hai usko dekhte hue vahaan chhedchhad karnaa thik nahin hoga or do mantriyon kii jagah do nae chehre laae gaye hai
 But is this really the solution? tippaniyan Those keeping an eye on Goa's politics feel that this is not the solution
 Yes, there has been an attempt to avoid the crisis at the moment, because the biggest question is that if Parrikar recovers there is no problem but if his health does not improve then What option will the BJP have then they will have to deal with the problem which they have currently avoided
 bijepi par abhi bhi yah aarope lagata he ki unhone janata ke janadesh kaa sammaan nahin kiya number do kii party hone ke baavjood unhone sarkaar banaai or congress jo number ek kii party thi use bahumat sabit karne kaa mauka nahin diya gaya, jabaki karnataka main yediurppa ko sabase badi party hone ke naate bahumat sabit karne kaa mauka diya gaya
 However, it is another matter that Yeddyurappa could not prove his majority
 magar ye formula goa main nahin lagu kiya gaya
 Now somehow the BJP has saved the government but there is a question mark on this government as to what will happen next because there is a big person from the party around whom Goa BJP politics is revolving

 baad main or pulicekarmiyon ne ise pakadaa or police ko bula liya
 The special thing is that there is a sticker of the Delhi Police logo on the car
 kal ye kah rahaa tha ki ye gaadi iske chachaa kii he jo dilli police main he, haalanki aaj wo stikar gaadi par nahin he
 Now we talked to this accused, it is said that yes, shame

 aaj 92 saal ke ho gaye purv dipti piem laalkrishna adwaneerath yatra nikaalkar bharat main hindutv kii raajnneeti kaa sutarapaat kiyabijepi ko satta ke shikhar tak le jane main ahm rokhyodhya andolan kaa sutarapaat kar bharatvarsh kii raajnneeti ko nai dhara dene vaale laalkrishna adwani aaj 92 saal ke ho gaye
 bjp's grandfather LK Advani was the hero of the 1992 Ayodhya movement
 ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan kii maang ko lekar 1990 main gujarat ke somnath se shuru kii gai unki rath yatra ne bharat ke saamaajik taane-bane par andar tak asar daalaa
 The great irony is that when 92-year-old Hero Advani is celebrating his birthday in very lonely moments today, the verdict of the Supreme Court of India on the same Ayodhya movement is coming
 pakistan kaa 'laal', bharat main kamallalakrishna adwanika janm avibhajit bharat ke sindh praant main 8 november 1927 ko hua tha
 Father's name was Krishnchand D
 Advani and mother was Giani Devi
 pakistan ke karachi main skool main padhe or sindh main college main daakhila liya
 When the country was divided, his family moved to Mumbai
 yahaan par unhone kanoon kii shiksha lee
 Advani joined the Sangh when he was 14 years old
 bharat main 1951 main ve shyama prasad mukherjee dwaara sthapit jansangh se jude
 BJP joined the Janata Party in 1977 and then BJP in 1980
 bijepi ke saath adwani ne bhartiya raajnneeti kii dhara badal di
 Advani experimented with the politics of Hindutva in modern India
 unka ye prayog kaaphi safal rahaa
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has started from a journey of 2 seats in 1984 to 303 seats in 2019
 rathyatra kaa ranneetikaravishwa hindu parishad 1980 main hi ram janmabhumi andolan shuru kar chuki thi, lekin tab is andolan ko koi bada raajnneeti sangrakshan hasil nahin tha
 Advani realized this opportunity
 1984 main indira gandhi kii hatya ke lahar main hue loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne 2 siten jeetin thi
 In 1989, the BJP formally started supporting this movement
 party ne ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan kaa vaada apane ghoshnaa patr main shaamil kiya
 Advani openly came out in support of this
 iskaa phayda bijepi ko loksabhaa chunaav main hua or party kii siten 2 se bad 86 ho gai
 After this, Advani joined the movement with full force
 ek ranneeti ke tahat unhone rathyatra kii ghoshnaa kii
 For this, he chose the departure point of Gujarat's Somnath Temple and the rath yatra was to be concluded in Ayodhya
 in donon hi sthanon ke bare main bhartiya janamanas main ek dharna thi ki ye donon hi sthaan islamic shaskaon ke hamale kaa shikaar ho chuke the
 Headlines from fiery speeches Batoriadwani started a rath yatra from Somnath on 25 September 1990 to mobilize support for the construction of the Ram temple
 is rath yatra ne kaaphi surkhiyaan batori
 Advani became a hero of Hindutva due to his fiery and fiery speeches
 hindi pattee rajyon main unki lokapriyata kaa graph jabardast badha
 However, during this Rath Yatra, there was a sense of communal disharmony among the hindu-muslim community in India
 adwani kaa iraadaa rajya-dar-rajya hote hue 30 oktober ko uttar pradesh ke ayodhya pahunchane kaa tha, jahaan vah mandir nirmaan shuru karne ke liye hone vaali 'karaseva' main shaamil hone vaale the
 But only against Advani, politics of an opposite axis was born in Bihar
 iske nayak the lalu yadav
 Lalu Yadav was leading the politics of opposing ideology of Advani
 adwani kii rath yatra jab bihar ke samastipur pahunchi to 23 oktober ko unhen tatkaaleen siem lalu yadav ke aadesh par giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Advani giving speech in Ayodhya (india today file photo) Bawal Advani's Rath Yatra of 1992 ended but the BJP again benefited in the 1991 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi kii siten 120 tak pahunch gai
 In 1992, the Ayodhya movement started climbing again
 rajya main tab kalyaan singh ke netritv main bijepi kii sarkaar thi
 UP Chief Minister Kalyan Singh gave an affidavit in the court to protect the mosque
 30-31 oktober ko dharm sansad yojit kiya gaya tha
 On 6 December 1992, thousands of Karsevaks gathered in Ayodhya
 laal krishna adwani, murali manohar joshi, uma bharti jaise netaa vahaan maujuud the
 The crowd became uncontrollable on seeing this
 is bheed ne babari masjid dhaha di
 LK Advani is still facing trial in this case
 pachaas saal tak number do raherammandir andolan kaa lokapriy netaa rahane ke baavjood adwani 50 saalon ke lambii sansadeey raajnneeti main bijepi main number do bane rahe
 In 1995, Advani surprised everyone by calling Vajpayee a contender for the post of PM
 1996 main adwani par hawala cond main shaamil hone kaa aarope laga, vipaksh unpar ungali uthaata isse pehle hi unhone sansad kii sadsyta se istipha de diya tha
 Later he was acquitted in that case
 laalkrishna adwani or atal bihari vaajapeyi (photo-india today file photo)bujurgon ko vidaa kiya, 'yuva' bhi chhod gaeaaj adwani saamaajik or raajnneetik jivan kii sakriyata se dur hai
 He has no accounts on social media
 haa logon se samvaad karne ke liye unka ek blog jarur he, jis par ve lambey antaraal ke baad kuch-kuch likhte hai
 bjp's iron man Advani, who is heading towards Shatayu, has lost his counterparts
 vaajapeyi, bhairon singh shekhavat, kailashpati mishra, madan laal khurana, sundar laal patwa jaise doston ko unhone apane saamne vidaa kiya
 Today, Advani stands at the juncture from where he is known as a historical witness of his long political past and the rapidly changing developments in the country
