ipel 2020 ke liye hui nilaamee main bhartiya captain viraat kohli kii parchi kaatane vaale westeindies ke star khilaadi ko koi kharidaar nahin mila
 In the ongoing ODI series between India and the West Indies, bowler Kesarik Williams, who became famous by his gestures, will not appear in the upcoming season of IPL
 apane 24 maichon main 41 wicket chatakaane vaale kesaric par nilaamee ke dauraan kisi ne daanv nahin lagaaya
 Kesarik kept a base price of Rs 50 lakh for himself, but despite his good performance, he was disappointed
 isi ke saath cricket ke diwaanon ko bhi ipel main unke ection kii kami khalegi
 Such was the cut of Virat in 2017, in fact, Kesarik bowled well in the ongoing series against the West Indies
 saath hi saath captain viraat kohli ke saath unki nokzok ko bhi logon ne khub enjoy kiya
 During the ODI, Kohli beat Kesarik Williams fiercely
 iske baad naatakeey andaaj main kohli ne unke naam kii parchi faadane kaa ishaara kiya

 aisa karke kohli ne do saal purana badla liya
 In the year 2017, Kesrik celebrated Kohli by dismissing Kohli in the same manner
 yah ghatana jamaica main khele gaye tii-20 ke dauraan dekhi gai thi, tab williams ne kohli ko 39 ke nijee score par out kar diya tha or parchi faadane ke andaaj main apni khushi jaahir kii thi

 gilcrist ne match ke baad samvaadadaata sammelan main bhi apni yahi raay doharaai
 He said, it was the same for both teams

 dalit kii jagah bahujan, ambedkarwaadi yaa anusuchit jati kaa istamaal hoga
 Not only this, the book of Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd has also been removed from the course of political science

 But i created a new course called Dalit Bahujan Political Thought

 7 percent shares have been sold

 After this report, Rahul Gandhi himself came to press conference and accused the government in new contexts
 tippaniyan Rahul said, "the CEO of Rafael had said that the reason for giving the contract to Anil Ambani beyond HL was that Anil Ambani owned the land
" ab baat nikalati he ki anil ambani kii company main dason ne 284 karod par daalaa or usee paise se anil ambani ne jameen kharidi matlab saaf he ki difolt kisi ho saaf jhooth bol rahaa he
 The big question arises that why Dassault put 284 crore rupees in the 8 lakh company which is not a loss making company
 ise kickbac kehete hai
 So, this is the first kickback given to Mr
 Ambani by Dassault
 and it is clear like day

 dalit kii jagah bahujan, ambedkarwaadi yaa anusuchit jati kaa istamaal hoga
 Not only this, the book of Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd has also been removed from the course of political science
 vir main manisha tiwari ne likhaa he ki standing cameti kii baithak main prastaav paas rakhaa gaya ki ilaiya kii kitaaben isliye hataai jaaen kyonki ve kathith taur par hindu dharm kaa apmaan karti hai
 On this news website, N
 Sukumar, who teaches in the Department of Political Science, University of Delhi, has put his side
 unka paksh yahi he ki jamaane tak polytical science vibhaag main manu, kautilya, tagore, gandhi saavarkar ko hi padhaayaa jaataa rahaa he
 But i created a new course called Dalit Bahujan Political Thought
 jisamen gautam buddha, jyotiba phule, ambedkar, periyar, tarabhai shinde, kanshiram ko padhaayaa jaataa he
 It also has Kancha Ilaiah's book along with other scholars
 sattarudh pratishthanon ko dalit vidwaanon ke uthaae sawaalon se pareshaani hoti he
 The word Dalit cannot be used after the High Court order
 isliye dalit shabd hataaya ja rahaa he
 But it has been decided to remove Kancha Ilaiah's book because it insults Hindu religion
 dow
 Ramchandra Guha is also accused of similar charges
 kaancha ilaiya kii kitaaben pard kar dekhie, aapako samaaj ko samajhane kaa gaharaa or nayaa nazariyaa milegaa
 Now come on Rafale plane dispute
 rohinee singh or ravi nair kii di vir main ek nai report ai he jisase rafaal vivaad ko lekar sawaal or gahare ho gaye hai
 Rohini Singh and Ravi Nair caught one thing which was not revealed yet
 donon ne likhaa he ki rafel vimaan banane vaali company ne anil ambani kii ek duusari niskriy company ardl main 35 fisadi hissedari kharid kar 284 karod rupee kaa munafa pahunchaaya he
 This company has nothing to do with making fighter aircraft
 dasso avishen ke saath reliance dephence kaa qaraar hua tha magar dasson ne ek niskriy company kaa share kyon kharida
 According to The Wire report, the company in which Dasso has invested is running at a loss and its revenue is zero
 yahi nahin reliance inphra ne jo saarvajanik filing kii he usase pataa chalata he ki isane vitt varsh 2017-18 main ardl ke 34
 7 percent shares have been sold
 di vir par aap puri report pard sakate hai
 After this report, Rahul Gandhi himself came to press conference and accused the government in new contexts
 tippaniyan Rahul said, "the CEO of Rafael had said that the reason for giving the contract to Anil Ambani beyond HL was that Anil Ambani owned the land
" ab baat nikalati he ki anil ambani kii company main dason ne 284 karod par daalaa or usee paise se anil ambani ne jameen kharidi matlab saaf he ki difolt kisi ho saaf jhooth bol rahaa he
 The big question arises that why Dassault put 284 crore rupees in the 8 lakh company which is not a loss making company
 ise kickbac kehete hai
 So, this is the first kickback given to Mr
 Ambani by Dassault
 and it is clear like day

 yahi nahin kaancha ilaiya shefrd kii kitaab ko bhi polytical science ke course se hataa diya gaya he
 Manisha Tiwari has written in the wire that in the meeting of the Standing Committee, a proposal was passed that Ilaiah's books be removed because they allegedly dishonor Hinduism
 isi news website par dilli vishvavidlaay ke polytical science vibhaag main padhaane vaale en sukumaar ne apana paksh rakhaa he
 His side is that till the time, only Manu, Kautilya, Tagore, Gandhi Savarkar have been taught in the Department of Political Science
 lekin maine ek nayaa course banaaya jiskaa naam tha dalit bahujan polytical thot
 In which Gautam Buddha, Jyotiba Phule, Ambedkar, Periyar, Tarabhai Shinde, Kanshi Ram are taught
 isamen anya vidwaanon ke saath kaancha ilaiya kii bhi kitaab he
 The ruling establishment is troubled by questions raised by Dalit scholars
 hoicourt ke aadesh ke baad dalit shabd kaa istamaal nahin ho saktaa he
 Therefore, the word Dalit is being removed
 lekin kaancha ilaiya kii kitaab kya isliye hataane kaa faisla hua he kyonki hindu dharm kaa apmaan karti hai

 Do you know that the Academic Affairs Standing Committee of the University of Delhi has ordered the removal of the term Dalit from the books read for the students of MA Political Science
 dalit kii jagah bahujan, ambedkarwaadi yaa anusuchit jati kaa istamaal hoga
 Not only this, the book of Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd has also been removed from the course of political science
 vir main manisha tiwari ne likhaa he ki standing cameti kii baithak main prastaav paas rakhaa gaya ki ilaiya kii kitaaben isliye hataai jaaen kyonki ve kathith taur par hindu dharm kaa apmaan karti hai
 On this news website, N
 Sukumar, who teaches in the Department of Political Science, University of Delhi, has put his side
 unka paksh yahi he ki jamaane tak polytical science vibhaag main manu, kautilya, tagore, gandhi saavarkar ko hi padhaayaa jaataa rahaa he
 But i created a new course called Dalit Bahujan Political Thought
 jisamen gautam buddha, jyotiba phule, ambedkar, periyar, tarabhai shinde, kanshiram ko padhaayaa jaataa he
 It also has Kancha Ilaiah's book along with other scholars
 sattarudh pratishthanon ko dalit vidwaanon ke uthaae sawaalon se pareshaani hoti he
 The word Dalit cannot be used after the High Court order
 isliye dalit shabd hataaya ja rahaa he
 But it has been decided to remove Kancha Ilaiah's book because it insults Hindu religion
 dow
 Ramchandra Guha is also accused of similar charges

 This company has nothing to do with making fighter aircraft
 dasso avishen ke saath reliance dephence kaa qaraar hua tha magar dasson ne ek niskriy company kaa share kyon kharida
 According to The Wire report, the company in which Dasso has invested is running at a loss and its revenue is zero

 After this report, Rahul Gandhi himself came to press conference and accused the government in new contexts
 tippaniyan Rahul said, "the CEO of Rafael had said that the reason for giving the contract to Anil Ambani beyond HL was that Anil Ambani owned the land

 The big question arises that why Dassault put 284 crore rupees in the 8 lakh company which is not a loss making company
 ise kickbac kehete hai
 So, this is the first kickback given to Mr
 Ambani by Dassault
 and it is clear like day

 In many areas, we are seeing that the death of a cow was given more importance than the death of a police officer
 '' abhinayta kii patni ratna pathak hai
 Shah said that he had decided that he would not give religious instruction to his children Imad and Vivaan because they believed that 'bad or good' had nothing to do with any religion

 or hamane tay kiya ki ham apane bacchon ko dharmik shiksha nahin denge kyonki meraa maananaa he ki kisi ke achche hone yaa bure hone kaa dharm se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 "shah said," We told our children the difference between good and evil, in which we believe
 maine unhen quran sharif kii kuch aayatein padhanaa bhi sikhaaya kyonki meraa maananaa he ki isse uccharan spasht hota he
 This is the same as reading Ramayana or Mahabharata improves one's pronunciation
 ''abhinayta ne kaha ki sthiti jald sudharne vaali nahin he
 He said that he is not scared but angry
 unhone kaha, ‘main apane bacchon ke liye chintit hum kyonki kal ko agar bheed unhen gherkar puuchhati he, ‘tum hindu ho yaa musalmaan?' to unke paas iskaa koi jawaab nahin hoga
 This worries me and i do not think there will be any improvement in these circumstances soon

 There has been a lot of rhetoric about the state of criticism in Hindi for a long time
 bayaanbaji shabd kaa istemaal sabhipraay kiya ja rahaa he kyonki gambhir vimarsh kaa sthaan vaktavyon ne le liya he
 Critical criticism has gone backstage by extractive statements, by stage and occasion, and capturing the landscape of the era
 kuch agar-magar ke baavjood is par vyapak sahmati-si dikhaai detii he
 Dr
 krishnadutt paliwal is rup main ukt tathy ke apwaad kahe ja sakate hai ki unhone pichley do dashakon main madhyakaalin hindi kavita se lekar bilkul aaj tak ke kaviyon or unke kavi karm par bebaaki se likhaa he
 In the course of editing the texts of Maithilisharan Gupt, the poet-guru of the unknowable and unknowable, Paliwal has thoroughly explored modern Hindi poetry
 isaki ek baangi unki naveenatam pustak hindi kaa aalochana parv main saaf dikhaai detii he
 This book is a 'compilation' of essays written at different times and occasions and altogether twenty-one essays have analyzed and analyzed the poetry of seventeen poets, ranging from Maithilisharan Gupta to Vinod Kumar Shukla
 But it does not present a sequential and complete history of modern Hindi poetry
 mahadevi verma ko chhodkar chhayavaad or pragativaad ke tamaam kavi is vimarsh main puri tarah anupasthit hai
 This is because Paliwal does not touch the poets and poetry by standing on the shore like a historian in it, but instead they have landed in the poetic ocean of poets
 chhayavaad-pragativaad or nai kavita ke bich maakhanlaal chaturvedi, bachchan or dinakar hindi kavita ke atyadhik mahatvapurn kavi hai jin par abhi tak dhang se vichaar nahin hua he
 One reason for this may possibly be that we have become accustomed to seeing Hindi poetry in promises and movements to such an extent that even a relatively small poet of debate and movement finds a place in history and criticism and is also a free poet
 The retail remains a poet
 dinakar or bachchan ke sandarbh main unke sahi moolyankan main bahut badi baadha unka manch kaa lokapriy kavi hona bhi kahin-na-kahin rahi he
 Paliwal, while considering these poets free from this 'stage bias', has also countered this reported injustice done to them

 Look at his voice: "hi Ri irony!" Modern criticism of Hindi has rejected the patriotic creations as a superficial poem of petty sentimentality
 is thukaraane ke peeche hindi ke un aalochakon kii sajeesh he, jo videshi vichaardhaaraon ke prachaarak yaa kapat muni hai
 These critics are provoking in the name of patriotism, like a madman is afraid of water

 Then, in his essay on Sahi, his reporting attitude has emerged in its brightest form, so it should not be surprising
 saahi par niabandh kii ve shuruyaat hi kuch aise karte hai, ''vijay dev narayan saahi kii smriti nai peedi ke dimag main basii itihaas, samaaj, samskruti or parampara ke chintan sutron kii vah kabhi na khatm hone vaali smriti he, jo hamaari pragatishiltaa or bhartiyata ke donon kinaaron ko garm rakhti he
 "he further writes Sahi's famous essay in relation to a debate on Hindi poetry under the pretext of short man," This single article alone has brought Sahi to the center of Hindi review
 is lekh ke vaakyon ko vivash hokar marxvaadi aalochakon ne apana 'hanuman chalisa' banaaya tathaa jor-jor se gaakar apana bhay bhi dur kiya
 The book also explores the poetic world of Ramnaresh Tripathi, Agnayya, Sarveshwar, Kunvarnarayan, Girijakumar Mathur, Bhavani Bhai, Raghuveer Sahay, Dhumil, Rajkamal Chaudhary, Balakrishna Rao and Vinod Kumar Shukla in different essays

 On February 14, the Supreme Court had ordered Unitech to deposit 14 per cent interest annually in the registry at Rs 17 crore
 1 janvari 2010 se farvari 2017 kaa byaaj aath hafte main jamaa karana hoga
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had returned the principal
 unitech kii gudgaanv sector 70 kii vista socity maamle main 39 khariddaaron ko supreme court se badi raahat mili thi
 The court had asked all the buyers to show their original amount documents out of the Rs 15 crore deposited in the registry
 court ne unitech ko chaar hafte ke bheetar do karod rupee registry main jamaa karaane kaa aadesh bhi diya tha
 The Supreme Court will now decide how much interest will have to be paid
 yah byaaj flats kharidaaron ko company main jamaa karai gai dhanrashi ke anupaat main diya jayega
 The court had said that the property developer should stick to the terms of the agreement so that it can give confidence in the people who dream of the house
 court ne aage kaha ki lekin, yahaan unitech ko alag alag bahaanon se deree nahin karne kii ijaajat nahin di ja sakati
 In the Vista Society case of Unitech's Gurgaon Sector 70, 39 buyers received a major relief from the Supreme Court
 court ne sabhi kharidaaron ko registry main jamaa 15 karod rupee main se apni mul raashi dastavej dikhaakar lene ko kaha tha
 The court also ordered Unitech to deposit Rs 2 crore in the registry within four weeks
 supreme court ab ye tay karegaa ki byaaj kitna dena hoga
 This interest will be paid to flat buyers in proportion to the amount deposited in the company
 court ne kaha tha ki property develper ko samjhaute ke niyamon ke saath rahanaa chahie taaki vah logon main bharosa dilaa sake jo log ghar kaa sapana dekhte hai
 The court further said that, however, Unitech cannot be allowed to delay with different pretexts here
 petrol or dijal kii keemten lagaataar badhati ja rahi hai
 Due to continuous increase in international crude oil prices, petrol prices have also crossed the 80 mark
 aise main aaj bajet main vitt mantri arun jetali aapako petrol-dijal kii badhati keemton se raahat de sakate hai
 For this, he can make an important announcement
 aise de sakate hai raahattel mantralayane vitt mantri arun jetali ko petrol-dijal par lagane vaali exise duty ghataane kaa suzav diya he
 If the finance minister accepts this suggestion, you can get a lot of relief from the rising prices of petrol and diesel
 haalanki sarkaar ke liye yah faisla lenaa aasaan bhi nahin hoga
 There is also a big question of lack of revenue in front of him
 rajkoshiya ghaataa badhane kaa khataraab aisa kadam uthaane kaa matlab hoga ki sarkaar apanaarajakoshiya ghatbadhane kaa khatra paidaa karegi
 Reduce the fiscal deficit by reducing excise duty 3

 This will create new challenges on the economy front
 tel companiyon se bhi raahat kii ummid kamadusari taraf,tel companiyonse bhi is morche par raahat milane kii ummid kam hi he
 Crude oil prices are increasing internationally
 isaki vajah se companiyon kaa kharch bhi lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, getting relief from the prices of petrol and diesel from these companies also seems difficult
 haalanki tel mantralay ke suzav ko dekhte hue ummid abhi bhi baaki he ki vitt mantriarun jetalibajet main petrol or dijal kii badhati keemton se raahat dilaane ke liye kuch na kuch praavdhaan jarur karenge

 New Delhi: It has been announced to give Bharat Bhushan Award-2018 to young poet Vihag Vaibhav
 pratishthit kavi arun camel nirnaayak the
 This award, given in memory of Tarasaptak poet Bharat Bhushan Agarwal, has been given to the young poet Vihag Vaibhav of Varanasi for his poem 'tea on shatru-sainik' published in the magazine 'tadbhav'
 kehete hai chaay kii izad ek buddha sant ne kii thi
 Buddhism is the religion of non-violence
 jivan-raag ko badhaane, usamen maadhurya gholne main nihsandeh chaay kii mahati bhoomika rahi he
 It is no surprise that the discussion on tea has become a powerful weapon of diplomacy and politics
 phir indinon to desh main kisi kii aavbhagat kaa yah ekmaatr strot he
 Now, the way the young poet Vihag Vaibhav entered the enemy camp and converted tea into 'aman-raga', it has become more important
 in dinon duniya main jis tarah hinsak vritti badi he or shaasha use niyantrit karne kii bajaae uske paksh main tark juta rahe hai vah ghor chintaa kaa bis he
 In such a situation, the way a young poet rejects the irrational logic of patriotism and establishes the human conscience through this poem in its rightful and proper context, is undeniably undeniable
 prem kii aprihaaryta, uski komal kintu majboot pakad, usamen milane vaale dhokhon ke baavjood pratighaati hinsa ke tark ko dhwast kar yah kavita ant main jaise jivan kii sanathan karunaa ke paksh main ja khadi hoti he- vah gadgad awak kar dene vaala he
 It is the best enterprise to save the humanity inherent in man

 The feeling of checking something off your “bucket list” gives you an indescribable sense of accomplishment
 
 
 and that's where i am in this moment
 I’ve always wanted to write a book, but the timing never felt right
 With each opportunity that presented itself, my first instinct was always to wait
 
 
 because i wasn’t (and I’m still not) finished
 i wanted to do more, live more, and achieve more, before putting pen to paper and exposing things I've always kept private to the world
 But looking back on my life as a public person, I’m super proud of what I’ve done and where my life is right now
 I've realized you don't have to be finished to tell your story, and that sometimes life's greatest lessons are taught along the ride
 
 
 when you’re still figuring things out
 
 
 when you're # unfinished

 It is reported from the sources that the government has agreed to make some changes in the bill
 sarkaar kii ore se kiye jane vaale badlaavon main trinmul congress dwaara die gaye sujhaavon ko shaamil kiya ja rahaa he
 The comments bataa den ki trinmul congress ne bill ke kuch hisson par yah kahkar aapatti jataai thi ki isse rajyon ke adhikaar kshetra kaa hanan hota he
 Under the Lokpal bill, there will be one Lokpal and seven members at the center and the bill also states that the states will have to make Lokayukta on the same lines
 trinmul, bhaajapa or tamaam anya dalon ko rajyon ko nirdeshit karne vaala upbandh pasand nahin aayaa tha
 He believed that this provision loses the federal structure of the country
 in logon kaa kahana he ki centre sarkaar ko yah aadesh nahin dena chahie balki yah rajya par chhod diya janaa chahie ki vah kaisaa lokayukta taiyaar karen
 Significantly, social activist Anna Hazare and his colleagues had said in their movement last year that if the states were not included in this bill then this bill would prove to be useless
 is bill ke samarthan ke liye sarkaar ne tamaam raajnneetik dalon se baatcheet aarambh kar di he
 Explain that the Trinamool Congress had objected to some parts of the bill, saying that it violates the jurisdiction of the states
 lokapal bill ke tahat centre main ek lokapal or saat sadsy honge or bill yah bhi kahata he ki rajyon ko bhi isi tarj par lokayukta banane honge
 The Trinamool, BJP and all other parties did not like the provision directing the states
 unka maananaa tha ki yah upbandh desh ke sangheey dhaanche kaa hris karata he
 These people say that the central government should not give this order but it should be left to the state to form a Lokayukta
 gauratlab he ki saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare or unke sahyogiyon ne pichley saal apane andolan main kaha tha ki yadi rajyon ko is bill main shaamil nahin kiya gaya tab yah bill bekaar sabit hoga
 The government has started talks with all the political parties to support this bill

 jangal kii aag se niklaa dhuaan ban rahaa karantasviren or video soshal media par virlaindonesia kaa aasmaan laal hota ja rahaa he
 It looks like red Mars
 log laal rang main duube hue shaharon, sadakon or gaanvon kii tasviren soshal media par viral kar rahe hai
 But this red color is a sign of danger
 logon ke ankhon or gale main jalan or dard kii shikaayat bad gai he
 Because this red color is formed due to the smoke sheet spread by the forest fire
 is chadar kii chapet main dakshin purv asia kaa bada ilaaka aa jaataa he
 There has been a continuous fire in Indonesia for the past 8 months
 isse 328,724 hectare jameen-jangal khaak ho chuke hai
 This is why so much smoke is spread
 aaie jaanate hai ki aakhir aasmaan aise laal rang main kyon badal gaya
 
 
 In meteorological language, it is called Rayleigh scattering
 yani prakaash kii kirnon ke bikharane kii vajah se aisa hota he
 The color of the sky changes when the particles present in the smoke change their color when light comes on
 dhuen main maujuud adhiktar kan aakaar main kareeb 1 micrometer ke hote hai
 Some are even smaller particles
 inkaa aakaar 0
 05 micrometers in size or less, which is high in smoke
 yahi akaash main suraj kii roshni padate hi laal rang main badal jate hai
 So you start seeing red color instead of blue in the sky
 jo tasviren viral hui hai ve dopaher main lee gai thim
 Therefore, red color is more visible
 lekin vahaan taapmaana baraabar hi tha
 Ini sore bukan malam
 Ini bumi bukan planet mars
 Ini jambi bukan di luar angkasa
 Ini kami yang bernafas dengan paru-paru, bukannya dengan insang
 Kami ini manusia butuh udara yang bersih, bukan penuh asap

 dwaraka sector-23 main police or badmaashon main muthbhedagangster kaalu banjaaraa kii hatya kaa aaropee pakadaa gaya Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday opposed the police's decision to impose prohibitory orders (section 144) at important places in New Delhi, including central Delhi, saying the government was waging a 'war' against the common people

 ’ Union minister Nitin Gadkari's statement has brought difficulties for the Bharatiya Janata Party standing on the backfoot on issues like SC / ST Act and Maratha Reservation
 gadakari ko apane bayaan par safai deni padi lekin shaayad tab tak kaaphi der ho gai
 Now Congress President Rahul Gandhi has also criticized the Union Minister for this issue
 darasal, gadakari ne kaha tha ki aakhir logon ko aarakshan kyon chahie jab desh main naukari hi nahin hai
 On this, Rahul taunted that Gadkari, you have asked the right question
 har bhartiya ye hi sawaal puch rahaa he
 After all, where are the jobs? What was Nitin Gadkari's statement? Actually, the Union Minister said in a program that even if reservation is given, there is no benefit because there are no jobs
 bank main iti ke kaaran naukariyaan kam hui hai
 Government recruitment is on hold
 naukariyaan kahaan hai?nitin garkarine aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha ki ek ‘soch’ he jo chaahati he ki niti nirmaataa har samudaay ke garibon par vichaar karen
 He said that a thought says that the poor is poor, he has no caste, creed or language
 uskaa koi bhi dharm ho, muslim, hindu yaa maratha (jati), sabhi samudaayon main ek dhada he jiske paas pahanane ke liye kapade nahin he, khaane ke liye bhojan nahin he
 After creating a ruckus on the statement, Gadkari also clarified it
 unhone likhaa ki mujhe kuch khabaren dekhne ko milin, lekin main saaf karnaa chahta hum ki aarakshan main badlaav ko lekar sarkaar kaa koi plan nahin he
 My attention has been drawn to certain media reports attributed to me
 There is absolutely no thinking at the central government to change the reservation criteria from castes to economic conditions
 - Nitin Gadkari (@nitin_gadkari) August 4, 2018 It is noteworthy that the agitation by the Maratha communities continues to demand 16 percent reservation in Maharashtra

 unki bahan sushmita sen se majboot bonding he
 Many pictures of siblings are seen together on social media
 rajeev bahan sushmita kii betiyon ke bhi behad kareeb hai
 Rajiv's Bollywood debut continues to be discussed
 pichley saal rajeev ke big bos 12 kaa hissaa banane kii khabar thi
 However, this thing was just a rumor
 bihar main jediu ke mantriyon or pravaktaaon kebich badhata vivadaamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Meanwhile, former Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that the spokesmen were not required to make such statements, but it has been going on in our party
 nitish ne kaha ki maanjhi ko hataane ko lekar party main koi vichaar nahin ho rahaa he
 This has already been cleared, but the game plan of the rest of the people is being exposed due to bjp's trap
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki philhal is maamle ko pradesh adhyaksh dekh rahe hai
 This matter should not be overstated
 is maamle main kaarywahi kaa adhikaar adhyaksh ke paas he
 In politics, this rhetoric goes on a bit, but you should say your point within the limits
 nitish kaa bijepi par vaaranithish ne kaha ki puri bijepi hi split personality kaa charitra rakhti he
 Split personality used to be in person, but the whole party has become the victim of split personality
 pehle maanjhi ko remote control kii sarkaar bataate the ab kehete hai ki maanjhi ko pratadit kiya ja rahaa he
 BJP people are making them laugh
 ye bijepi kaa doharaa charitra dikhaata he
 'BJP should give up the dream of breaking JDU', Nitish attacked the rebel leaders and said that rebel leaders should leave the BJP and dream of breaking JDU
 party majboot he or andar se majboot he
 The dirty game of breaking the party has been playing since the time of Manjhi Sarkar
 rajya sabha chunaav ke vakt bhi inhone aisa hi kiya tha
 It was a matter of complete concern that the angry ministers of the party demanded the resignation of the party spokespersons
 bihar ke mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ke sadhu yadav se milane kii khabaron ke baad jediu pravaktaa ne un par sawaal uthaae the
 The second spokesperson demanded the resignation of three ministers who spoke in support of Manjhi
 nitish mishra, narendra singh or vrushan patel ne maanjhi kaa bachaav karte hue kaha tha ki unhen pad par bane rahanaa chahie
 You must have heard of the quarrels and violence between the brothers, who have real estate, but for the first time the case of one brother shot and killed by stealing the laddus brought by his grandmother in Dhanori village of Jind district of Haryana has come
 mritak ke pita dwaara police ko di gai shikaayat main bataaya gaya he ki tarsem or vikaas kii daadi mangalvaar ko ek shaadi samaaroh main gai thi
 From where she brought the laddu
 daadi ne laddu ek sandook main taala laga kar rakh die
 When 20-year-old Tarsem came to know about laddus in the canister, he opened it and ate the laddus
 usee vakt uskaa chachera bhai vikaas bhi vahaan pahunch gaya
 Because laddus were kept in the development canister, he did not like the action of the procession
 donon ke bich main laddu ko lekar chhina jhapati hui or baad main jhagade ne hinsak rup le liya
 Shot in brother's chest
 
 
 donon bhai ladate hue khet main ja pahunche
 The accused Vikas got so excited while abusing him that he shot Tarsem in the chest
 goli lagate hi tarsem khet main gir padaa
 The family members then took Vikas to a local hospital in critical condition
 jahaan doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 On the basis of the complaint of the deceased Tarsem's father Mittu Lal, the police have registered a murder case against accused Vikas and arrested him
 haalanki, police kaa yah bhi kahana he ki hatya ke peeche koi or bhi vajah ho sakati he jisaki jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Anandiben, who was once a teacher, became the successor of Narendra Modi in Gujarat today
 rajya kii pehali mahila mukhyamantri baniin anandiben kii chhavi rajya mantri ke taur par kathor prashaasak or mehnatee netaa kii rahi he
 Anandiben is one of Modi's closest and loyalists
 73 varshiya is netaa ko modi kii swabhaavik uttaradhikari ke rup main dekha ja rahaa tha, kyonki unhone mantriyon ke us dal kii aguwai kii jise modi ke apni party ke paksh main vyastatam loksabhaa chunaav prachaar abhiyaan main lage rahane ke dauraan rajya ke rosemara ke kaamkaaj kii jimmedaari di gai thi
 Anandiben and Amit Shah are often referred to as Modi's left and right hand in Gujarat
 anandiben ke paas shahari vikaas, rajasav or aapadaa prabandhan jaise ahm vibhaag hai
 She has also previously served as Minister in-charge of Education Department
 vah modi kii kuch ahm pariyojnaayen safaltaapurvak chalaa rahi hai jinamein mahila sakshartaa badhanaa bhi shaamil he
 The social equation of BJP has also been taken into consideration in Anandiben's election for the post of Chief Minister as Patel is the largest and most influential caste in the state
 do dashak se adhik samay se patel party ke mukhya janaadhar rahe hai
 Anandiben was the longest serving minister in the state government to keep herself away from wasteful things
 laalchowk par fahraaya tha tirangaa1
 She joined the BJP in the second half of the 1980s and since then she continued to advance in the party
 2
 Anandiben, who was married to Professor Mafatbhai Patel, has been living away from her family since the mid-1990s
 3
 He has a son and a daughter
 4
 Mafatbhai had announced his plans to contest the Lok Sabha elections on the Aam Aadmi Party ticket
 5
 Anandiben became famous across the state in 1987 when she was a school teacher in 1987 and jumped into Sardar Sarovar to save two girls from drowning
 6
 Apart from getting the gallantry award from the Governor, BJP leaders also took cognizance of this adventure of Anandiben
 7
 Since some BJP leaders were introduced to her husband at that time, she wanted such educated and adventurous women to join the party
 8
 Anandiben also received several government awards as a teacher
 9
 Anandiben, who succeeded Modi, has been working closely with her since she joined the party and Modi used to meet party leaders of the state as an RSS pracharak
 10
 The career graphs of both continued to grow together
 vah ekmaatr aisi mahila netaa thim, jo 1992 main srinagar ke laalchowk par tirangaa fahraane ke dauraan tatkaaleen bijepi adhyaksh murali manohar joshi ke saath thim
 11
 do saal baad vah rajyasabha ke liye nirvaachit huin
 Always considered talented in the party, Anandiben was asked to contest the Assembly elections in 1998 and she became a minister in the then Keshubhai Patel government
 12
 When Modi was sent out of Gujarat due to the internal factionalism of the party, Anandiben never hid her allegiance to Modi
 13
 Modi gave Anandiben the responsibility of important portfolios and increased his stature
 vah sheeghra hi unki sabase vishwast mantrimandaleey sahyogi samajhi jane lageen

 Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is struggling with a huge foreign exchange crisis, asked Pakistanis living abroad to learn from expatriate Indians and expatriates from China who have invested heavily in their homeland
 imran khan ne arthvyavastha ko gati dene ke liye pravasi pakistaniyon se desh main nivesh karne kaa aahvaan karte huye unhen bhrashtachar mukt maahaul uplabdh karaane kaa aashwaasan diya

 unhone kaha, ‘‘log bhrashtachar or unke jivan ke bich sambandh ko nahin samajhate hai 
 
 
 Their lives are badly affected by corruption

 This is the situation of the people of the area, but instead, the people of the entire Delhi have the same situation today

 Now this is the big question as to why the MCD is not ready for these diseases at the time

 unhone kaha, ''main samajhataa hum ki sarkaar or nyaayalay donon ko milakar rasta nikaalnaa chahie

 Gujna Ghalib's Ruh Senatak: kaid-e-hayatankarkar Surendra Vermin Director: Danish Iqbal Artist: Danish Iqbal, Nidhi Mishra, Sadanand Patil, Vasundhara Bose Famous names have been written on the life of Mirza Ghalib but the fun of this drama written by Surendra Verma Itself is different and if it gets a well-directed director, then watching the drama becomes a quality experience indeed
 danish ikbaal vaise to rashtriya natya vidhyalay (enesdy) se shikshit hai lekin aisi nafis urdu main likhe naatak uthaane main tamaam enesdidaan bhi haaf jate hai
 It was also about them
 par text ke saath gutthamguttha hote hue aakhirkaar ve gaalib kii ruh ko pakad paane main kaamyaab rahe
 The total story is that Ghalib (danish) has an influx of borrowers
 pension or mukademe ke silsile main ve kalkatte jate hai
 Even after returning, the house is under house arrest due to non-payment of debts
 unki shaayari likhte-samajhate un par nisaar hui katiba (nidhi) tadapate hue mar jaati he
 It is clear at the outset through a dialogue in a simple meeting hall that nothing is right between Ghalib and his Begum Umrao (vasundhara)
 ghar bas chal rahaa he
 Ghalib is writing intricately, telling his contemporary Yasin (patil) with him again and again, making him realize that he too with his poetess
 gaalib kah baithte hai: ''kami mere kalam main nahin, logon kii samaj main he
 "it is Ghalib's style of sarcasm and sarcasm on himself when he says to the battered Katiba in madness," i am a good poet, only two people know this
 ek aap or ek main
 "tension at home, rivals' bets, Katiba's madness and head-over-account, self-proclaimed protagonist Parvez who has built 20,000 ghazals
 danish jis shiddat or ehsaas k saath gaalib ke dwandv ko ubhaarte hai, nidhi usee tarah katiba kii chahat, bebasii or tadap ko gaharaai se mahasoos karaati hai
 In the popular drama Jangura of Kingdom of Dreams, Patil, who plays the main villain Zoravar, wins a completely different type of Nafees character here
 abhinay ke lihaaj se ek chaunkaane vaala pahalu jodatii hai vasundhara bose
 In his second play, Ghalib's utter disgruntled, angry and helpless Ardhangini Umrao's character has a lot to say about his delusions
 ab jab bhi iskaa sho ho to bina kisi andeshe ke dekh sakate hai

 'senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia tweeted in this case,' a temple of Bapu's killer is built under the nose of Shivraj Singh Chauhan in Gwalior, while Chauhan pretends to 'fast' in Gandhi's name
 yah ek sharmnaak or nindaneey krity he
