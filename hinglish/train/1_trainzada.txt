 On September 29, Mahmood's Birthday in Hindi films, Mahmood made a place as a comedian at a time when humor was not given prominence
 kamedi kii nayi paribhaasha garh kar hasya ko film ke ahm tatv ke taur par sthapit karne vaale mahmud ke aage nayak bhi aage beasar prathit hote the
 Despite being the son of an actor, the film journey for Mahmood has not been easy

 ‘parvarish’ main unhone us samay ke pramukh sitare rajkpur ke bhai kii bhoomika kii thi
 The film raised his comedic talent and Hindi films got such an artist that later the heroes also started eating 'awe'
 mahmud kii lokapriyata kaa yah alam tha ki unke charitra ko dhyaan main rakhkar kahani likhi jaati thi or vah charitra filmon kaa abhinn hissaa hota tha
 There was a naturalness in the humor of Mahmud whose audience was thrilled by the timing and sharpness

 Mahmud, who kept the pulse of the audience, gave more comedy films than one
 kishor kumaar or sunil dutt ke saath ‘padosan’ ho yaa shobhaa khote ke saath sasuraal, ziddee yaa lav in tokyo ho, mahmud darshakon ko hansaate rahe

 The audience also appreciated his changed look
 apni adaaon or bhav bhangima se darshakon ko hansaa hansaa kar lotpot karne vaale mahmud abhinay ke prati samarpit the
 This dedication earned him highs and earned him many awards including Filmfare

 beshak aankade, maidan or form ke lihaaz se bharat-newzealand series se pehle jaankaar team india par daanv laga rahe hai
 But there is something different in this Kiwi team, due to which even the knowledgeable or captain Virat Kohli is giving importance to his strength
 match kis din kiske paksh main ghoomegaa, ise lekar dilchaspee zarur badhati ja rahi he
 The sequence of events that started 65 years ago in 1952 on the Green Park of Kanpur, the ground will now witness the 500th and historic Test of the Indian team
 bhartiya team ko yakeenan is baat kaa ahsaas he lekin usase bhi badi baat team ke liye ye he ki is sizan ke 13 gharelu test is team ke kai khilaadiyon ke kariyar kii disha tay kar sakate hai
 Captain Virat Kohli is also expecting a lot from his team
 captain viraat kohli kehete hai, "ye sizan team ke khilaadiyon ke kariyar kii disha tay kar saktaa he

 But spin will be strong, it cannot be denied

 But Kiwi spinners like Ish Sodhi and Mitchell Santner can also test Team India's batsmen hard
 ise na to diggaj maanane se inkaar karte hai na hi maujuuda team management
 The comments viraat kehete hai, "pichley dinon hamane videshi daure par tej gend ke kilaaf khilne par jor diya isliye spin ko tavajjo nahin di
 We also performed well against the fast ball
 mujhe lagata he is par dhyaan dene kii zarurat he
 We are emphasizing this in the nets

 But this team of Ken Williamson looks a bit different from before

 main stant kar saktaa hum or darshakon kaa manoranjan bhi kar saktaa hum
 Bigg Boss is not just a fun show but it is a big challenge to appear in this program and not lose your identity
 tivi ke alaava unka sapana filmon main abhinay karnaa he
 Balraj said, i want to act in Hindi and Punjabi films
 main ek abhinayta bananaa chahta hum
 The grand finale of the program was aired on MTV channel on Monday evening
 bharat ke pramukh mandiron main se ek gujarat ke gir-somnath jile main sthit somnath mandir ne faisla kiya he ki vah apane paas rakhe sone main se 35 kilo sona modi sarkaar kii gold monetigeshan skim main nivesh karegaa
 Let us tell you that as the trustee of this temple, there are many leaders including PM Modi who have approved the temple administration for the investment of gold in this scheme
 trust ke sachiv pike lahidi ne is bare main jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki trust ke paas kareeb 35 kilo sona aisa he jo shuddh sone yaa gahanon ke rup main he
 He said that most of the gold we have available is used in the decoration of the temple
 35 kilo sona aisa he jise roj ke kaam main istemaal nahin kiya jaataa he isliye ise hamane is skim main lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 Let us tell you that earlier Siddhivinayak Temple had decided to invest 40 kg in the gold monetization scheme of the Sonamodi government
 is nivesh se mandir ko 69 lakh rupee kaa salanaa byaaj milane kii ummid he
 Significantly, amidst the government's efforts to market worthless $ 1,000 billion worth of gold in the country, everyone's eyes are on the temples having large reserves of gold
 haalanki inamen se kai mandiron ke sanchaalkon ko is baat kii ashanka he ki shraddhaluon se daan main praapt swarna aabhushanon va vastuon ko sarkari yojana ke liye galane se dharmik bhavanaaen aahat ho sakati hai
 What is Planning and Procedure It is worth mentioning that the ambitious gold monetization scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi aims to bring an estimated 22,000 tonnes of gold lying in factories, religious institutions and elsewhere into the financial system
 sone ko aabhushan ke rup main bhi jamaa kiya ja saktaa he, lekin bank use pighla kar uski shuddhta kii jaanch ke baad jamaa aabhushanon kaa mulya tay karte hai
 Independence Day is celebrated every year on 15 August in India
 vahiin, pakistan har saal 14 agast ko swatantraaa diwas (pakistan Independence Day) manaata he
 Although both countries were free on the same day
 ab sawaal uthta he ki akhirpakistan15 agast kii jagah 14 agast (14 August) ko swatantraaa diwas (pakistan Independence Day) kyon manaata he? darasal,indian independence bilko british sansad ne 18 july ko paarit kiya tha
 According to this bill, India will be partitioned on midnight of 14-15 August, which will bring two new countries named India and Pakistan into existence
 pakistan main swatantraaa diwas 15 agast kii bajaae 14 agast ko manaae jane ke peeche ek kaaran he
 Pakistani historian KK Aziz writes in his book Murder of History that the transfer of power to these two countries was to Viceroy Lord Mountbatten
 mountbeton ek hi vakt par nai dilli or karachi main maujuud nahin ho sakate the
 Apart from this, it could not have happened that they would first transfer power to India and then to Pakistan because as per law, their role was to become the Governor General of India as soon as the power was transferred to India
 aise main lord mountbeton ne vysarai rahete hue 14 agast ko pakistan ko satta hastantarit kar di
 But Pakistan did not get independence on 14 August because the date was 15 August in the Indian Independence Act
 saal 1948 main pakistan main aazaadee kii taarikh ko 14 agast kar diya gaya tha
 Different things emerge on this
 kai reporton main kaha gaya he ki us saal 14 agast ko ramajaan kaa 27waan din yani shab-e-kadra pad rahaa tha
 It is believed that on this night the religious text Quran was completed and this day is considered very holy
 iske baad pakistan kaa swatantraaa diwas 14 agast ko hi manaaya jane laga
 Some historians believe that the Pakistani flag was hoisted in Karachi only after the Viceroy transferred power on 14 August and hence the date of Pakistan's Independence Day was later changed to 14 August

 Manish Sisodia, who made Arvind Kejriwal the CM of Punjab, came to the media as if the wait for the BJP was over
 bijepi netaa arvind kejariwal ko gherne kaa koi mauka nahin chhodana chaahate
 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari said that it has become clear from Sisodia's statement that what is the real intention of Kejriwal
 tiwari ne kaha ki dilli chunaav se pehle kejariwal or unki party gaanaa ga rahi thi ki paanch saal kejariwal or ab do saal main hi kejariwal bhaag khadey hue
 The BJP is already trying to surround Kejriwal on the issue of government failure in Delhi and is taking an aggressive stand against the Kejriwal government on matters like corruption
 somvaar ko hi bijepi ne bade netaaon or saansadon ke saath kejariwal ke ghar par hallaa bolaa tha or mantri satyendra jain kaa hawala maamle main naam aane par istipha maanga tha
 By accusing the Delhi government of not paying the salaries of MCD sweepers in Delhi, the BJP is also trying to put the responsibility of the garbage of the capital on the Kejriwal government
 aise main ab sisodiya ke bayaan ke baad bijepi ko ek or morche par kejariwal ko gherne kaa mauka mil gaya he
 That is why Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari appeared first to take the front on Sisodia's statement

 Now it has also become clear
 manoj tiwari ne kejariwal ko katghare main khadaa karne ke liye anna kaa bhi sahaara liya
 Tiwari said that Anna had already identified Kejriwal and said that he was greedy for power and now Anna's words are being proved true

 The increasing share in women's voting, the unabashed responses of women in the survey and the increasing number of women's issues in electoral promises suggest that women are steadily increasing their presence on the political scene

 Why is Reliance Jio lagging behind services like free unlimited 4G data, lifetime free calling and roaming till 31 December
 yah sawaal hairaani bharaa he, lekin research ke mutabik mukesh ambani kii company reliance jeeyo infocom do maheene tak logon ko free data or colling dene ke baad bhi duusare bhartiya telecom companiyon ko takkar dene main naakaamayaab dikh rahi he
 And perhaps this is the reason why the company can extend its welcome offer for three more months
 city research kii ek report ke mutabik reliance jeeyo ke aane ke baavjood airtel, edia or vodaphone ke yujarbese main pichley chah maheenon main sabase zyada badhotaree darj kii gai he
 The City Research report, released on November 21, states, "looking at the current data, it does not appear that Reliance Jio's offer has made any significant impact on other companies in the second month of its launch
 airtel, vodaphone or edia ke sab data main pichley chah maheene ke dauraan oktober main sabase zyada badhotaree hui he'analists ke mutabik telecom diggaj bharti airtel abhi bhi top par bani hui he
 The Cellular Operations Association of India has the highest number of Airtel customers in October
 33 million kii badhotaree hui
 Also 1 in Idea and Vodafone respectively
 43 million or 1
 An increase of 12 million has been recorded
 disambar tak nahin jute paaenge 100 million customers!reliance industries limited ke chairman mukesh ambani ne desh main jeeyo launch karte vakt kaha tha ki 31 disambar tak 100 million customer company kaa torget he
 But according to a report by market research firm Motilal Oswal Research, by the end of December, the company may fail to raise 100 million customers
 isaki vajah ye he ki jeeyo kii growth rate main 50 fisadi kii giravat hui he
 It is worth noting that recently Reliance Jio has started SIM keyhome delivery to achieve a target of 100 million customers
 desh main shaayad yah pehali baar he jab koi company pizza kii tarah ghar ghar sim pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 These are the possible reasons for the failure of Jio - free service is being received, but a continuous decline in the speed of 4G data is also being recorded
 chaahe speed test kii website ho yaa phir TRAI kaa speed test portal
 All these have told through data that its speed has been steadily decreasing since its launch
 aise main jaahir he customers niraash honge hi
 - There is free calling, but there is no guarantee that the call will be connected
 aam taur par jeeyo se jeeyo colling kaaphi aasaan he
 But there are problems in calling on other networks from Jio
 - bina 4G handsetke reliance jeeyo yuj nahin kar sakate
 The 4G smartphone still proves to be far-fetched in villages
 iske alaava logon ke paas pehle se mahange smartphone he to wo phir se ek 4ji smartphone lene main hichakate to jarur hai
 - Due to the dual SIM smartphone, people are using the former number with Reliance Jio SIM
 kyonki jaahir he welcome ofer ke baad paise dene honge or jagah jagah jeeyo kii sarvice slo ho rahi he
 Although the Pakistani military and government use terrorism against India, but the people there want peace and peace like Indians
 aisi hi apil karte hue ek pakistani chaatra ne piem modi ko khat likhakar badhai di he
 11-year-old Pakistani student Akeedat Naveed has congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the historic victory of BJP in India's largest state Uttar Pradesh
 modi ko likhe do pej ke khat main navid ne kaha ki bhartiya pradhanmantri ko bharat or pakistan ke bich shanti or aman ke liye kaam karnaa chahie
 Like Indians, they want to earn more and more hearts of Indians
 pakistani akhbaar duniya news ke mutabik kaksha paanch kii chaatra navid ne kaha ki piem modi bharat or pakistan ke bich shanti prakriya main teji laane main madad kar sakate hai
 Pak student described peace and peace between the two neighboring countries as very important
 navid ne apane khat main kaha, "ek baar mere abba ne kaha tha ki logon kaa dil jeetna behad adbhut kaam he
 i think you have won the hearts of Indians, because of which you won a spectacular victory in the UP Assembly elections
 haalanki main kahana chaahati hum ki agar aap or bharatiyon or pakistaniyon kaa dil jeetna chaahate hai, to aapako donon mulkon ke bich shanti, aman or dosti ke liye kadam uthaanaa chahie
 "pak girl India and Pakistan need good relationships
 lihaaja aap shanti or aman ke liye bharat or pakistan ke bich pul kaa kaam karnaa chahie
 We have to buy the book (book) instead of the bullet (bullet)
 ham bandook kharidne kii bajaay garibon ke liye dawaaen kharidenge
 Pak student emphasized that it is up to both the countries to adopt peace or conflict
 iske baad usne upi main bijepi kii shandaar jeet ke liye piem modi ko badhai di
 Lahore resident Naveed has already written a letter to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj regarding peace and peace
 bhartiya adhikariyon ne bhi uske khat kaa jawaab bhi diya tha
 India won the fifth ODI against South Africa
 is jeet ke hero shatak banane vaale star openar rohit sharma (115) rahe
 Rohit was not only eagerly waiting for the innings played in the fifth ODI, but Team India was also waiting for his return to form from the beginning of the tour of South Africa
 ab is pari se rohit kii jaan main jaan main jaan ai, kyonki lagaataar naakaamiyon se unpar kaaphi dabaav tha
 However, before the South Africa series, Rohit was in top form
 lekin dakshin africa pahunchate hi unhen jaise saanp soongh gaya
 Rohit told this innings that when he is in color, his bat makes such a noise
 jab rohit shot lagaate hai to boundry bhi choti pad jaati he
 And when Rohit freezes, he only makes a century
 bataa den, isse pehle 5 vanade pariyon main rohit ke balle se sirf 47 ran nikle the
 Ie 9
 4 kii ausat se dakshin africa daure par 4 test pariyon main 78, or isse pehle 4 vanade main sirf 40 ran
 That is, if you add all the innings of the tour of South Africa, only 118 runs came out of Rohit's bat in 8 innings before this match
 wo bhi 15 se kam ausat se or is dauraan unke khate main ek ardhashatak nahin he
 Before the end of the ODI series, Rohit returned to form and the Indian dressing room also felt relieved
 shikhar to lagaataar ran bana rahe the
 And now with Rohit coming in color, Team India's batting strength increased further

 Hashim Amla scored the highest 71 runs for Africa
 david miller ne 36 or captain aden markeram ne 32 ranon kaa yogadan diya

 lalu prasad bhale hi nitish kumaar kii party se gathbandhan karne kii baat kah rahe hon, lekin bihar siem jithan ram maanjhi ne lalu ko 'saanpnath' kahkar maamle main twist paidaa kar diya he
 If all goes well, Nitish and Lalu will become friends once again
 lalu ne jediu se gathbandhan ke sanket de die hai
 But here Lalu talked about joining hands with Nitish, on the other hand, Nitish's successor Jeetan Ram Manjhi called Lalu as 'snake Nath'
 lalu ne nitish se gathbandhan kaa man to bana liya, lekin lagata he ki jediu ke man main ab bhi lalu ko lekar kasak barkaraar he
 Perhaps this is the reason why when Lalu called upon the Mandalist forces to come together to cut the 'kamandal', CM Sahib made a strange statement
 ab koun jane, bihar ke siem kii jubaan fisali yaa phir lalu ko lekar dil kii baat jumba par aa gai
 On the other hand, BJP is taking a crackdown on the new political khichdi that is brewing between Lalu and Nitish
 baharhaal, siyasat main kuch bhi naammumkin nahin he
 After years of politics of enmity, Lalu and Nitish are going to be seen playing the alliance of friendship once again

 Dalwai last month also condemned the heinous killing of three members of a Dalit family in Jawkheda village in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra and earlier the killing of people of Khairlanji community in Sonai and Kharda villages of the state
 unhone sarkaar se in sabhi maamalon ke aparaadhiyon ko giraftaar karne ke liye tatkaal kadam uthaane kii maang kii he

 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who ousted the Left Front from power because of her ingenuity and prudence in West Bengal, was so innocent in childhood that many times her friends stabbed her in the back

 maine punarikshan ke liye kaha or paaya ki jahaan main use paas karaane kaa prayaas kar rahi thi vahiin usne meri uttar pustika main saare uttar kaat die the
 This was a good way to avenge a friend
 ’mamata ne likhaa he ki unka bachapan kaa sansar ghar, skool or khilne tak simit tha or unke paas or kisi cheez ke liye vakt nahin tha
 He did not even wish for a 'boyfriend'
 mamata ne likhaa he ki jab unki saheliyon kaa prem prasang chal rahaa tha to vah ‘boyfriend’ kaa matlab bhi nahin jaanati thim
 Recalling how uncomfortable she felt when friends spoke to her boyfriend in her presence, she wrote, "I didn't even know the meaning of the word 'boyfriend' and could not ask anything after that

 is baar ke chunaav main partiyon ne apane vot aadhaar kii chintaa chhod sari kavayad musalamaanon ke vot paane main hi laga di
 This created a dilemma among Muslims on one hand and Hindu votes against it on the other side
 isi kaa nateeja chunaav main ab dikh rahaa he
 "in UP, the Muslim vote is 18 per cent in two and a half dozen seats and more than 35 per cent on a dozen
" inamen se badaayun or azamgarh ko chhodkar baaki sabhi siton par bijepi jiti he
 The special thing is that the areas with more than 40 per cent Muslim voters have also fed lotus
 kahaan-kahaan bachi numaaindagiuttar bharat main sirf bihar se hi musalamaanon ko kuch aasraa mila
 The four Lok Sabha seats here were won by RJD from Araria, NCP from Katihar, LJP from Khagaria and Congress candidates from Kishanganj
 haalanki musalamaanon ko sabase behatar hissedari pashchim bengal main mili
 Maximum eight Muslim mps have reached Parliament from here
 inamen se chaar trinmul congress ke or do-do marxvaadi communist party or congress ke hai
 Apart from this, three mps from Jammu and Kashmir, two each from Kerala and Assam and one each from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Lakshadweep have come to the Lok Sabha
 bifer gaye bade netaave sari partiyaan jinhone antim samay tak congress ke prati thodi bhi sahanubhuti dikhaai, unako is chunaav main sabase zyada nuksaan hua
 The Trinamool Congress was the only party that opted out of the Congress in due course of time, so it did not suffer at all
 is tathy ko bhi nakaara nahin ja saktaa ki paaramparik rup se inhen gaiyr-bijepi partiyon se musalmaan chunaav jitate rahe hai
 That is why Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, while resigning after JDU was reduced to 20 Lok Sabha seats from 20 in the election, said, "I have not seen such a communal election in my life
" ’’ to raajnneeti main unke puraane mitra se pratidwandvi or phir sahyogi bane lalu ne musalamaanon ko najar main rakhte hue kaha, ‘‘main narendra modi ko badhai nahin duungaa
 "but Mulayam Singh Yadav got ahead of all this
 haar ke baad party kii samiksha baithak main hi unhone rajyamantri kaa darja paae 36 mantriyon kii lalabatti chin lee
 If party sources are to be believed, Mulayam said in the meeting, "you all have no right to sit here
 fouran baahar nikal jaao
 And take care to go with your feet, do not even sit in a red light car parked outside
 ’’bhitarghaat bhi rahi vajahapaschim bengal main muslim saansadon ko aath siten isliye bhi mil gayi kyonki vahaan muslim voton kaa bahut adhik bantwaaraa nahin hua
 States like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have less Muslim voters anyway
 lekin uttar pradesh jahaan 19
 5% are Muslim, the question remains there
 agar uttar pradesh kii saharanpur seat par najar daalen to muslimbahul hone ke baavjood congress ke imran masood yahaan se isliye haare kyonki unke mukaable main unke chachere bhai shajaan masood sapa kii tikat par lard rahe the
 Masood lost by nearly 70,000 votes, while his cousin got more than 50,000 votes
 kabhi moulana abul kalam aaazaad kii seat rahi rampur main sapa ke naseer ahamed khan kii haar kii badi vajah congress ke nawab kazim ali khan urf naved miyaan ko mili 1
 There are more than 5 lakh votes
 iske alaava partiyon main bhitarghaat bhi isaki vajah he
 Shafiq ur Rehman Burke, who lost on the SP ticket from Sambhal seat in western Uttar Pradesh, alleged, "iqbal Mahmood (minister) spent all his strength and time to defeat me
" ’’ isi tarah purvi uttar pradesh kii shravasti seat se sapa pratyaashee atik ahamed ne ek bayaan main kaha, ‘‘mahmud khan (sapa vidhayak) apane dost or pis party ke pratyaashee rigwan jahir ko jitawane main lage the or party ke liye kaam karne kaa unke paas vakt hi kahaan tha
 In fact, the BJP in its strategy had decided to give tickets to only the winning candidates and split Muslim votes
 bijepi kii record jeet ne musalamaanon ko tikat dene vaali partiyon kaa supada saaf kar diya
 In such a situation, the number of Muslim mps is not so surprising
 mali kii mahila cricket team ne mangalvaar ko tii-20 main antarrashtriya str par sabase kam score apane naam kiya

 website iespncriinfo kii report ke mutabik, isse pehle yah ricard china kii mahilaon ke naam tha jinhone isi saal janvari main yuai ke khilaaf sirf 14 ran banaae the
 The six runs scored by Mali, Rwanda achieved the record of winning the most balls remaining in the women's T20 by four balls

 a day before the release of 'rustom', Rajinikanth has congratulated Akshay Kumar for the film
 2013 main twitor jwainn karne vaale rajnikant ke twitor par 3 million se zyada folbers hai
 Although Rajinikanth does not use Twitter much
 phir bhi unhone twit kar bollywood staffkshay kumarako unki aane vaali film ke liye shubhakamanaayen di hai
 Akshay also thanked Rajinikanth by replying to the tweet and also asked him to watch the film
 haalanki rajnikant pehle star nahin he jinhonen'rustam'ke liye twit kiya he
 Earlier, Salman Khan, Ranveer Singh and Sonam Kapoor also tweeted and promoted the film

 Mahesh Bhatt is a filmmaker auto menuphacturers ne BS-III wheekals kii cell par bain se ek saal kii chhot paane ke liye pitishan lagaai thi, lekin supreme court ne ise khaarij karte hue 1 april 2017 se deshbhar main bharat stage (BS)III wheekals ke cell par bain laga diya
 According to reports, now companies have about 8 without a cell with BS-III emission norms
 2 lakh wheekals hai
 Know what is Bharat Stage Emission Norms: Vehicles contain fuel which causes pollution, a standard is set to control the same, which is called Emission Norms
 jaise-jaise vakt badalata he technology main bhi vistaar hota he, aise main polution control karne ke liye nit nae prayog kiye jate hai, jisase emishan norms main bhi badlaav aata he
 Auto companies are shocked by the Supreme Court, BS-3 vehicles will not sell from April 1, under this emission norms, companies are directed to prepare vehicles so that air pollution can be controlled
 nae standard aane se ful ko bhi badla jaataa he
 Currently, BS-IV standard is running in India and BS-III has been banned
 ise euro-iv bhi kaha jaataa he
 Let us tell you that the Government of India has decided that it will implement BS-VI emission norms except BS-V
 jo 2020 tak lagu kii jaaegi
 Number of vehicles with BS-III emission norms (20 March 2017): Commercial vehicles - 96,724 two-wheelers - 6,71,308 three wheelers - 40,048 cars - 16,198 According to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, without a cell in the country
 Number of BS-III two-wheelers done 71 lakh units hai
 The country's two largest companies Hero motocorp and Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India have the largest share with 80%
 hero ke paas 2
 90 lakh units and Honda has around 2
 50 lakh BS-III unit wheekals hai
 All our models follow the BS-IV emission norms: Suzuki companies support the sale of BS-III vehicles, including Hero motocorp, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India, Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Mahindra & Mahindra and TVS Motor
 mahangi hongi BS-IV wheekals:reports ke mutabik, BS-IV wheekals BS-III emishan norms vaale wheekals sejyada mahangi hongi
 Because two-wheelers will only support BS-IV if they are replaced by a fuel injection system instead of a carburetor
 aisa karnaa companiyon ko mahangaa padataa he
 Currently, fuel injection systems are commonly offered in higher end vehicles

 The Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi has received official approval from the Delhi Cabinet to appoint an advisor to run 1 thousand electric buses
 kejariwal sarkaar kaa daawa he ki june 2019 tak dilli kii sadakon par electric bason kii shruwaat ho jaaegi
 Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot said that the Delhi Integrated multi-model Transit System (DIMTS) has been given the responsibility as a consultant for the entire project of electric buses to promote public transport and curb increasing pollution
 jo agle teen maheene main is project kii laagat, takanic, planning or har ek hisse se judi study ke baad report degi
 Gehlot said that so many electric buses in the world did not come on the streets simultaneously
 pehle dilli main sienji se kranti ai thi
 Now a new chapter of electric buses will be added to it
 mantri ne ummid jataai he ki aane vaale dinon main puraa transport system i transport ban jayega
 Deputy CM Manish Sisodia told about the cabinet decision that based on the study report, the financial model of bringing buses will be decided and from june-july next year, electric buses will run on Delhi's roads
 iske alaava supreme court ke aadesh ke mutabik dilli sarkaar ne hydrogen technology ke istemaal ko lekar study karne ke nirdesh bhi transport department ko die hai
 Public transport vehicles based on this technology are also being considered to run in Delhi
 cabinet ke faisle ke bare main mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne twit kar bataaya ki, ''cabinet ne dilli main ek hajaar electric basen chalaane ke liye kansaltent niyukt karne kii manjuuri de di he
 This is a major step towards modernizing Delhi's public transport system and reducing pollution
 ''aapako bataa den ki dilli vidhansabha ne 2018-19 'green' bajet paas kiya tha, jisamen ek hajaar electric bason ko laane kii baat kahi gai thi
 Deputy CM said that according to the budget, the timeline for these buses is three months late and the cabinet has also approved it
 unhone kaha ki china ko chhodkar kahin par bhi itani badi sankhya main electric basen chalaane kii taiyaari nahin kii gai he
 There are only 30 electric buses operating in India, of which 25 are in Himachal Pradesh and 5 are in Mumbai
 iske alaava desh ke 10 rajyon main sirf 440 bason ke liye tender jari kiya he
 Sisodia said that electric vehicles are the concrete solution to strengthen public transport system and tackle pollution
 sarkaar chaahati he ki dilli main saare public transport system ko i-vikal main badla jaae
 Along with buses, taxis and other modes of public transport system will also be converted into e-vehicles
 unhone bataaya ki in bason ke liye finanshal model kya hoga or kitni sabsidi di jaaegi, is par faisla dimts kii study report ke baad hoga
 a complete plan should be prepared about the charging infrastructure of electronic buses and which bus depots will have a charging infrastructure
 parivahan vibhaag in ek hajaar electric bason ke liye purvi vinod nagar, bavana sector 5, buraadi, rohinee sector 37, revala khanpur or narela main bas depo kaa nirmaan karegaa
 These depots will have arrangements for charging and charging of electric buses, for which the help of DISCOM will be taken
 aapako bataa den ki dilli main 10 march 2016 se 2 july 2016 tak ditisi ne ek electric bas kaa trial kiya tha
 This electric bus had run 16 thousand 915 kilometers, during this time, due to puncture only once, the bus was unoccupied with them
 2015 worldcup main dhamaakedaar shuruyaat ho chuki he
 On a bounce pitch like Australia, the batsmen have performed tremendously
 mujhe aisa lag rahaa ki australia ke maidan par gendbaajon ko koi zyada phayda nahin mil rahaa he
 In 2015, 2888 runs have been scored in five matches played so far, which is a record in itself
 itnaa hi nahin aankade bataate hai ki jab bhi world cap main pehle paanch maichon main zyada ran bane hai, bharat ne usee toornament main karishmai pradarshan kiya he
 To date, no World Cup has scored so many runs in the first five matches
 2015 worldcup main pehle ballebaaji karne vaali har team ne abhi tak 300 se bhi zyada ran banaae hai
 New Zealand scored 331 runs against Sri Lanka in the first match of the 2015 World Cup
 duusare match main australia ne england ke khilaaf 342 ran kaa vishaal score khadaa kiya tha, tisare match main south-africa ne zimbabwe ke khilaaf 339 ran, vahiin, bharat ne pakistan ke khilaaf 300 ran or aaj ke match main west-indies ne ireland ke khilaaf 304 ran banaae
 In this case, the team batting first performed very well
 pehle paanch match main pehle batting karne vaali team ne 323 kii ausat se 1616 ran banaae hai
 The batting team has scored 1272 runs at an average of 254
 paanch match main pehle batting karne vaale team chaar baar jiti he, jabaki baad main batting karne vaali team sirf ek baar jeet darj kar pai he
 Today Ireland has defeated the West Indies in a chase of 304 runs
 agar itihaas ke nazariye se dekha jaae to 1975 se 2011 ke bich khele gaye 10 worldcup ke pehle paanch match yani 50 match main 396 kii ausat se 19803 ran bane hai, lekin is baar khele gaye paanch match main ausat 577 ran ke kareeb he, jo ek record he
 The first five matches of the World Cup played in England in 1979 were the least runs scored
 us vaqt har team main sabase khatarnaak gendbaaj the jo ballebaajon ko haaavee hone nahin de rahe the
 The most dangerous bowler was in the West Indies team, which won the West Indies World Cup
 1979 pehle paanch match main koi bhi team 200 se zyada ran nahin bana pai thi
 Whether batting first or later
 1979 main pehle paanch match main 345 kii ausat se sirf 1726 ran bane the
 Before the 2015 World Cup, the highest runs scored in the first five matches of the World Cup were the 1983 World Cup which was played in England, in which 2742 runs were scored in the first five matches and India won this World Cup under the captaincy of Kapil Dev
 Was
 1987 worldcup jo bharat or pakistan main khelaa gaya tha
 In the first five matches of this World Cup, 2487 runs were scored and India reached the semi-finals and the 2002-03 World Cup which was played in South Africa and Zimbabwe, 2332 runs were scored in the first five matches in this World Cup and India reached the final
 Tha and 2269 runs were scored in the first five matches in 2011 and India won the World Cup under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 to ham yah maan sakate hai jis bhi worldcup main pehle paanch match main zyada ran bane hai, bharat ne us worldcup main kaaphi acha pradarshan kiya he
 We should expect India to do well in the 2015 World Cup as well

 auskar vijeta e
 R
 rahamaan par sangeetkaar ismail darbar ne sangeen aarope lagaae hai
 These include allegations of theft of tunes
 unhone kaha ki film slamdog milionair ke liye auskar jeetne ke liye rahamaan ne auskar se jude academy ke adhikariyon ko rishwat di thi
 Ismail made these sensational allegations against Rahman in a special conversation with the English newspaper of Mumbai
 unhone kaha, rahamaan bahut achche vyavsaayee hai
 i will say once again Rahman has bought the Oscar
 yahi nahin, film main jin gaanon ko sangitabaddh karne kaa rahamaan daawa kar rahe hai vah unke he hi nahin
 i have proof that hail
 
 The song is not composed by him
 subhash ghai or maniratnam jaise filmkaar yah hakeekat jaanate hai, lekin kisi main bhi sach bolne kii takat nahin he
 This is because Rahman is a big figure
 darbar ne rahamaan ko chunauti di ki agar unamem sach kaa saamana karne kii himmat he, to saamne aaen or mujhe jhootha sabit karen
 i have evidence that he took the credit of someone else himself
 agar jarurat padi to main in sabooton ko sabake saamne pesh karunga
 The court objected to the National Award for the music of the film Saathiya (2002)
 unhone kaha ki rashtriya puraskaar kii sangeet shrenee main meri devdas bhi daud main thi
 That companion fell behind
 darbar kaa tark he ki dab film ko rashtriya award nahin diya jaataa, aise main saathiya ko puraskaar kaise de diya gaya? is baat kaa zikr main hameshaa se karnaa chaah rahaa tha lekin kisi ne is par mujhase baat nahin kii
 On the other hand, Rahman's colleague Vijay Iyer has described these allegations as rubbish
 unhone kaha, agar koi rahamaan par tippanee karnaa chahta he to kar saktaa he
 Everyone in the country has the right to speak
 rahamaan pichley bees varsho se industry se jude hai
 If someone says that they bought the Oscar, can they tell how Rahman got an Oscar nomination for the film 127 Hours? jammu evam kashmir kii 87-sadasyeey vidhansabha ke liye varsh 2014 main 25 november or 20 disambar ke bich paanch charnon main chunaav karwaae gaye the, jinamein tatkaaleen sattarudh neshnal conference kii haar hui, or congress ke saath gathbandhan main sarkaar chalaa rahi party ko sirf 15 siton se santosh karnaa padaa
 On the other hand, the BJP, which won only 11 seats in 2008, won 25 seats this time in the 'modi wave', and after 52 days of governor's rule, formed the government by supporting the PDP of former Union Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed
 ram rahim or haniprit ko lekar ek behad chaunkaane vaala khulaasa hua he
 a former dera serviceman has sensationally revealed that Ram Rahim wanted a child from his Honeypreet to be the dera chief
 purv sevadaar gurdas singh tuur kaa aarope he ki ye idia khud haniprit kaa tha
 She did not want her son Jasmeet Singh Insan to get such a large empire of Dera after Ram Rahim
 gurdas singh tuur ke mutabik, ram rahim ke baad dere main haniprit kaa dabadabaa number do jaisaa ban chukaa tha, isliye wo chaahati thi ki ram rahim or uskaa koi baccha ho to vahi dere kaa mukhiya bane
 Ram Rahim was also ready for this and wanted that the child's father's name should remain Vishwas Gupta in the eyes of the world, but after realizing his trick, Vishwas had already divorced and destroyed his hopes
 vahiin, is maamle kaa ek or chashmadid saamne aayaa he, jo us raat kaa gavaah he, jab shaadi ke baad pehali baar hani baba baba kii gupha main gai thi
 Gurdas Singh, son of Khata Singh, the driver of Ram Rahim, is an important eyewitness to Honeypreet and Baba's relationship
 ram rahim ne hi haniprit kii shaadi karwaai
 Shortly thereafter, one night Honeypreet was invited to stay in her cave
 gurdas us raat gupha ke baahar tainaat tha
 Gurdas Singh had suspected for the first time that day, Ram Rahim was going to do something wrong with Honeypreet
 agali subah haniprit baba kii gufa se roti hui baahar nikali thi
 In those days, Honeypreet's grandfather used to be the treasurer of the camp
 haniprit sidhe dada ke paas gai
 Seeing his condition, his grandfather created a lot of ruckus in the camp
 ram rahim ke khilaaf khul kar bolne lage
 But he was silenced
 is ghatana ke fouran baadahanipritdera chhod kar apane ghar fatehabad ke liye nikal gai
 But some of Baba's henchmen chased Honeypreet and picked her up with a weapon on the way and brought her back to the camp
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki us din haniprit ne kasam khai thi ki wo baba ko barbaad karke dam legi
 Gurdas now feels that Honeypreet is probably under oath behind the destruction of Ram Rahim

 in / mashhoor nirdeshak karimuddin asif un chuninda logon main se rahe hai jinhone kuch hi filmein banaai, lekin aisa kaam kiya ki aaj bhi unhen yaad kiya jaataa he
 k Asif directed 3 films in his career
 jinamein se ek film puri bhi nahin ho pai
 k Asif is famous for his style of working
 unhen mughal-e-ajam se jo lokapriyata mili wo bahut saare log, apane puure kariyar main bhi kabhi nahin hasil kar pate
 Asif made a film called "phool" 15 years before mughal-e-azam
 unhone ''lav and god'' bhi banaai, jo ki adhuri rahi
 The film was released in 1986 after 23 years
 asif kaa janm 14 june, 1922 ko hua tha or 9 march 1971 main unka nidhan ho gaya
 K
 asif kii pehali film kuch khaas nahin kar saki thi, lekin duusari film ‘mogul-e-aazam’ ne itihaas bana diya
 It took 14 years to make 'mughal-e-azam'
 ye film us vaqt banani shuru hui jab hamaare yahaan angrejon kaa raaj tha
 Perhaps it could also be a reason why it took so long to make it
 ye us daur kii sabase mahangi film thi
 The cost of this film is about 1
 5 karod rupee bataai jaati he
 Which is considered very much according to that time
 film ke ek gane ‘pyaar kiya to darana kya’ ko filmaane main 10 lakh rupee kharch kiye gaye, ye wo us daur kii wo rakam thi jisamen ek puri film ban kar taiyaar ho jaati thi
 This song was chosen by Naushad Saheb after rejecting 105 songs
 is gane ko lata mangeshkar ne studio ke bathroom main jaakar gaaya tha, kyonki recording studio main unhen wo dhun yaa gunj nahin mil paa rahi thi jo unhen us gane ke liye chahie thi
 The producer of the film was Shapoorji Palounji Mistry, who did not like cinema at all
 wo filmein nahin dekhte the, lekin naatak dekhne ke shaukeen the or iske liye aksar opera house jaaya karte the, jahaan prithviraj kapur ke naatak hote the
 Actually, the foundation of the film started from here
 prithviraj, asif ke hunar se parichit the
 So he was the one praising Asif with Shapoorji, saying, you have a lot of money and only a person like you can finance a mad man like Asif
 pataa nahin kitne saal or kitne paise lagenge, par main itnaa yakeen se kah saktaa hum ki wo film abhootpurv banayega
 At the behest of Prithviraj, Shapoorji became the financier of the film and then the film started getting money
 vaise shapurji kii dilchaspee ke peeche ek kahani ye bhi he ki shapurji akbar kii shakhsiyat ke diwane the
 Asif was convinced of salim-anarkali's love interest, due to which he started making films, but Shapoorji's interest was aroused due to Akbar
 haalanki, shapurji film ke iklaute financer nahin the
 Whatever Asif earned in these 16 years, he put everything in this film

 Yadav dismissed Arvind Kejriwal's recent agitations without naming him, saying, "issues related to the country are more important than any issue
" ' unhone arvind kejariwal ke robert vadra or rielity company dlef kii ore se lagaaye gaye aaropon kaa ullekh karte hue kaha ki ek or ghotaalaa janata ke saamne aa gaya he
 NDA convenor Yadav said on allegations of financial irregularities in the trust run by Law Minister Salman Khurshid and his wife, 'another scam is emerging
 ' unhone kaha ki unhen wadra yaa khurshid ke khilaaf lagaae jane vaale aaropon kii pramanikta ke bare main jaankaree nahin he
 He warned that the scandal in the operation of the Commonwealth, 2G, coal block allocation and the Ministry of Civil Aviation in the noise of these issues should not be forgotten

 The year began with her captaincy of the Indian team in all formats and the year ended with her marriage
 viraat ne disambar ke shuruaati dinon main hi bollywood actress anoushka sharma se byaah rachaaya
 Talking about the game, whether it is ODI, T20 or Test Virat's bat, the captaincy of Virat is dominating the mind everywhere
 viraat ne har record ko apane naam kiya he
 In the middle of the year, there was some sourness regarding the coach issue, during which Virat was also criticized
 lekin viraat ke balle ne sabhi aalochakon kaa munh shant kar diya
 Virat emerged as a successful batsman, successful captain in 2017, his ability was also honored by Wisden, known as cricket's greatest magazine
 wisden ne viraat ko apni megsine ke cover par jagah di
 Virat became the second Indian player after Sachin to do so
 agar aankadon kii baat karen to viraat kohli ne is saal antarrashtriya cricket main sarvaadhik 2818 ran banaae
 These are the highest runs ever scored by any Indian in a calendar year
 ek calendar year main kisi bhi ballebaaj dwaara sarvaadhik ran banane ke maamle main kohli duniya main tisare ballebaaj ban gaye hai

 Kohli has a total of 6 double centuries in Test matches, all these centuries he has killed as a captain
 bataur captain dohare shatak jadne waalon main kohli duniya main number ek par pahunch gaye hai

 bihar main hue kathith mitti ghotaale ke maamle main argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav sahit unke puure parivaar kii mushkilen bad sakati hai
 State Chief Secretary Anjani Kumar has asked the Forest and Environment Department to investigate the matter and submit a report
 mukhya sachiv ne adhikariyon se puri tender prakriya or iske aavanton ke bare main tatkaal jaankaree maangi he
 Let us tell that former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister and BJP Legislature Party leader Sushil Kumar Modi accused Lalu's family of scam
 unka aarope tha ki sanjay gandhi jaivik udyaan main jo mitti bharaayi ho rahi he, vah argedy supremeo ke parivaar ke ban rahe mal se nikaal kar laayaa ja rahaa he
 What is the whole matter
 
 
 aaropon ke mutabik rajdhani patna main bihar kaa sabase bada maal banaaya ja rahaa he
 The mall is owned by Delight Marketing Company Private Limited
 is company main argedy adhyaksh ke lalu prasad ke bade bete evam rajya ke paryaavaran evam van mantri tejpratap yadav, chote bete evam up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav or unki putree chanda yadav diarector hai
 According to such allegations, the owner of this mall is the family of Lalu Prasad Yadav
 modi ke mutabik argedy ke sursand se vidhayak saiyad abu daujana kii company meridian construction (india) limited is shopping mal kaa nirmaan karvaa rahi he
 Tej Pratap Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav and Chanda Yadav were made directors on 20 June 2014 in the Delight Marketing Company Private Limited of Rs
 9 lakh
 aarope he ki bihar ke sabase bade mal kii mitti ko paryaavaran evam van vibhaag ne bina tender nikaale 90 lakh rupye main kharid liya
 Thus according to Modi, the family of the RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav got the full benefit of the soil scam
 lalu kaa bhi he role!bijepi netaa modi ke mutabik yah vahi company he jisko lekar bihar ke vartmaanajal sansaadhan mantrirajiv ranjan singh urf lalan singh ne varsh 2008 main aarope lagaaya tha ki tatkaaleen rail mantri lalu prasad yadav nerelway keranchi or puri ke do hotalon ko galat tareeke se hotel sujatha ke harsh kochar ko bech diya
 In return, Kochhar transferred two acres of land in Patna to the Delight Marketing Company through ten terms in a single day
 yani is puure maamle main taar kahin na kahin lalu prasad yadav se bhi jud jate hai
 Purchase without tender Tender was clever enough to conserve the basement of the mall, the Environment and Forests Department purchased the soil for Rs 90 lakhs on the basis of quotation only in the name of beautification of Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park in Patna and it The work was done by Virendra Yadav's company MS Enterprises of Roopaspur
 ghar kaa hi mantri or apana hi vibhagaju main mitti kii itani zarurat nahin thi, lekin shopping mal ke mitti ko thikaana lagaana tha isaliye 90 lakh kaa tender diya gaya
 To sell the soil of this mall, in the name of beautification, it was estimated to unnecessarily buy 90 million rupees of soil in the name of footpath
 is prakaar lalu prasad kaa parivaar apane mal kii mitti ko apane hi vibhaag main bech kar 90 lakh kii kamai kar chukaa he
 This garden comes under the Department of Environment and Forests and the minister of this department is Lalu Prasad Yadav's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav

 Now the matter will be heard on August 13
 dilli kii patiala house court ne is maamle main sonia rahul sahit maamle main sabhi aropiyon ko kal pesh hone ko kaha tha
 Failing to properly maintain the Tughlakabad Fort and protect it from encroachment, the Delhi High Court pulled up the Archaeological Department of India (ASI), saying that no other city has a history as old as Delhi
 uske baavjood dilli kii aitihaasik dharohar ko lekar aapkaa ye ravaiya he
 Delhi has no past history of any city whether it is Mumbai or Kolkata
 isliye desh kii agali pidiyon ke liye sambandhit adhikariyon dwaara dilli ke itihaas ke sangrakshan kii jarurat he
 The court said that over time there have been frequent encroachments and illegal constructions around this fort
 jabaki is ilaake main kisi bhi tarah ke nirmaan karne kii ijaajat nahin he
 These buildings are the pride of India and are for the movement and movement of the general public

 The company said that it would not be charged for calling Jio's phone or landline
 iske saath hi whatsap or phestime samet is tarah ke anya manchon se kiye gaye phone kol par bhi shulk nahin lagegaa
 Incoming phones of all networks will remain free

 Petrol and diesel prices have caught fire again
 guuruuvaar ko dilli main 1 litre petrol 69
 81 is getting Rs
 vahiin, dijal ke liye aapako 59
 47 rupees have to be paid
 kachche tel kii keemton main lagaataar badhotaree ho rahi he
 This is directly impacting the prices of petrol and diesel in the country
 naye saal main sarkaar aapako inaki badhati keemton se nijaat de sakati he
 Actually, the central government can take a decision on bringing petrol and diesel under the GST regime in the new year
 agar sarkaar aisa karti he, to aapako ek litre petrol ke liye mahaj 45 rupee chukaane pad sakate hai
 Similarly, diesel can also be found in you
 ye bhi padhein : 1 litre petrol sirf 45 rupee main? naye saal main mil saktaa he tohfavitt mantri arun jetalibhi petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke tahat shaamil karne kaa sanket de chuke hai
 He has said that it will be included under GST after the consent of all the states
 oil ministar dharmendra pradhan bhi petrol-dijal kii badhati keemton se nijaat dilaane ke liye inhen jiesti ke daayre main laane kii sifarish kar chuke hai
 If the government takes this decision in the new year, after coming under the ambit of GST, you will get only 45 for a liter of petrol in Delhi
 45 rupee chukaane honge
 Whereas for diesel you may have to spend 43 rupees
 jiesti ke daayre main aane ke baad petrol or dijal par zyada se zyada 28 fisadi tex lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Taking it as standard, then petrol-diesel may cost you much cheaper than the current prices
 pehle to ye samajhen ki philhal kaise aapako ek litrpetrol 69 rupeka miltaa he
 According to the paid-up price detail of Indian Oil Company till December 25, one liter petrol 31 to the company dealer after the purchase of crude oil and refinery expenses
 78 rupee main bechati he
 Thereafter, dealer commission (average) 3
 58 rupee judate hai
 Center on one liter petrol where 19
 48 rupee exise duty vasuulata he
 Right there, 14 in Delhi
 81 waite lagata he
 After mixing all these, you get 69 for 1 liter petrol
 65 rupee chukaane padate hai
 (prices as on 25 December) Similarly for diesel (as on 25 December) 32 from companies dealer
 61 rupee vasuulati hai
 2 in it
 52 rupee kaa dealer kamishan judata he
 15 after this
 33 rupee exise duty or 8
 74 rupees VAT added
 is tarah aap ko ek litre dijal ke liye 59
 20 rupees have to be paid
 jiesti ke tahat hoga ye badlangale saal agar sarkaar petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke tahat laane kaa faisla le leti he, to is par lagane vaali exise duty or waite khatm ho jayega
 The government gets a lot of revenue from petrol-diesel
 aise main ye mana ja saktaa he ki sarkaar is 28 fisadi jiesti lagaaegi
 Companies 31 to dealer for one liter of petrol
 78 rupee vasuulati hai
 3 in it
 58 rupee kaa dealer kamishan judata he
 In this way the price of a liter of petrol is 35
 36 paise pahunch jaati he
 VAT and Excise Duty may attract 28 per cent tax under GST
 ye bhi padhein : bharat banegaa duniya kii 5veen sabase badi iconomi28 fisadi tex lagane par 35
 9 in 36
 90 rupee jud jayega
 In this way you get 45 for a liter of petrol
 26 paise chukaane pad sakate hai
 Currently, the company dealers one liter diesel 32
 61 rupee main bechati hai
 Dealer commission 2 in it
 52 rupee judata he
 One liter diesel 35 like this
 13 paise ho jaataa he
 9 after taxing 28 per cent
 83 paise judenge
 In this way you have 44
 96 rupee main milegaa
 After coming under GST, the impact of increasing and decreasing crude oil prices will be seen on the prices of petrol and diesel
 haalanki isse inaki keemton main bade str par badlaav nahin aayega
 Because the tax on this will be fixed
 is tarah petrol kii keemten 50 rupee ke daayre main hi simat sakati hai
 Although the government may impose cess with the imposition of 28 per cent tax, after this the prices of petrol and diesel will be much lower than the current prices

 bijepi kaa palatwaar-aadarshon or vichaar par kaam nahin kar sakati congressaj RSS ko desh kaa pratik bananaa chaahate hai, ye sambhav nahin sonia gandhigandhi jayanti par congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke ek bayaan par bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne jamkar palatwaar kiya he
 BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said that the Congress working on the basis of photographs cannot work on ideals and ideas
 narsimha raav jaise piem ko bhi congress sweekaar nahin karti or vah rashtriya pratik ko sweekaar karnaa to bhul jaaen
 Politics on the picture of Congress: bjpinlin Kohli said that Congress has done politics on the picture of Mahatma Gandhi throughout his life
 hamane hameshaa vichaaron kii raajnneeti kii he
 Whereas PM Narendra Modi worked for the people of the country from cleanliness to health
 bijepi ne hameshaa rashtrawaad kii raajnneeti kii he
 He said that Congress has always used Mahatma Gandhi's name
 congress ne har sarkari yojana ko rajeev gandhi, indira gandhi or jawahar laal nehru ke naam par shuru kiya
 Before accusing us, the Congress looked into its predecessor
 congress ko gandhi parivaar ke baahar kabhi bhi kuch dikhaai nahin detaa he

 Hey, no need to think too much

 Deepika Padukone is set to go for a world tour on April 30 along with her co-star Ranbir

 This tour of the two worlds is for the promotion of their upcoming film 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani'
 haalanki deepika kaa apni filmon kii vajah se shedul bahut tite he
 He has taken some time off from his next films director Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Rohit Shetty for a promotional tour of 'yeh Jawani Hai Deewani'
 ve 20 din ke liye ranbir kapur or film ke puure kafile ke saath pramotional tour par nikal jaaengi

 teen maheene pehle tirthasthal bodhgaya main hue dhamaakon or patna main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii raily ke samay hue dhamaakon ke bich 'sidhaa sambandh' sthapit karne ke baad jaanchakartaaon kaa daawa he ki in donon aatankwaadi ghatnaon ke aadesh sidhe pakistan se aae the, jahaan indian mujahidin (iem) kaa sansthaapak mana jane vaala riyaaz bhatkal ab rahata he
 Investigators claim that they have caught several chats (chats) between Riyaz Bhatkal and Tehseen Akhtar through instant messaging website Nimbuzz
 bataaya jaataa he ki bihar se agast main indian mujahidin ke netaa yaccin bhatkal kii giraftaar ke baad se tahseen akhtar hi aatankwaadi sanghathan ko chalaa rahaa he
 Investigators believe that Riyaz Bhatkal has been giving direct orders for terrorist attacks
 giraftaar ke baad yaccin bhatkal ne bhi kathith rup se poochtacha karne waalon ko bataaya tha ki use bodhgaya dhamaakon kii koi jaankaree nahin he or ab iem ke kai modul ek saath kai nirdeshon par kaam karte hai
 In fact, Yasin and Riyaz hail from the same village in Karnataka, from where both are believed to have started their careers in terrorism
 ab jaanchakartaaon kaa kahana he ki aatankwaadiyon kii patna ke gandhi maidan main 27 oktober ko narendra modi kii raily se pehle dhamaake karne kii himmat isiilie hui, kyonki jaanch agenciyaan bodhgaya dhamaakon ke maamle main na kisi thos nattejey par pahunchin, na koi giraftaar kar pain
 However, earlier this week, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) raided a small hotel in Ranchi in search of Hyder Ali, the prime suspect in the Patna blasts
 haidar ali tab tak faraar ho chukaa tha, lekin enie ko vahaan se 27 jinda bamon ke alaava ek chart bhi mila, jisamen un logon ke naam darj the, jinhone kathith rup se july main kul 13 bam bodhgaya main lagaae the
 The two attacks have a lot of similarities, and according to investigators both attacks were carried out by the newly formed Ranchi branch of the Indian Mujahideen
 donon hi jagahon par chah-chah log bheje gaye, or donon hi jagahon par inhone do-do kii tiimon main bantakar teen-teen bam lagaae
 According to investigators, Imtiaz Ansari was among the bombers at both the places, who were arrested while trying to escape from Patna railway station
 sarkaar kii filon par gopneey likhaa hota he, iskaa matlab he ye jaankaree saarvajanik nahin hogi
 In the same way, we have some information about your life which we do not want the world to know
 kya aap chahenge ki aapke naam se likhi gai chitthee koi or pard le or yah bhi jaan le ki chitthee kahaan se ai he
 You read it with a chest or showing it to the whole world
 ye udhaaharan isliye de rahaa hum taaki yah baat sabake saamne barabari se saaf ho jaae ki sabake saamne chitthee kaa padhanaa privesi niztaa kaa ulanghan he
 Like if i start taking your passbook and see how much money you have, you will feel bad
 jis tarah se sarkaar kii gopneeyata uski niztaa he, privesi he, usee tarah se aapaki niztaa yani privesi kii bhi gopniyata he
 Nowadays Aadhaar is being made mandatory in many things
 aadhaar card main aapaki kai suchanaaen hoti hai
 Nowadays all these information is called data
 duniya ke kisi bhi desh main ye data surakshit hote hue bhi antim rup se surakshit nahin he
 Due to accumulation in one place, there is a danger of being blown up
 udaaya bhi gaya he
 In the Supreme Court, 20 petitions have been filed against the linking of Aadhaar with a biometric fingerprint
 26 janvari 1950 ke samvidhan lagu hone ke 67 saal baad bharat kii supreme court kii samvidhan peeth is baat par vichaar kar rahi he ki niztaa, privesi aapkaa moulik adhikaar he yaa nahin
 This question has come up in the context of Aadhaar in front of the Bench of 9 judges
 kai chizon main aadhaar ke anivaary kiye jane ko chunauti dene vaali yachika main yah sawaal uthaa he ki aadhaar ke baad kisi kaa kisi se pardaa nahin rahegaa
 Privacy will end
 yah moulik aadhaar kaa hanan he
 That is why it is being considered whether privacy is a fundamental right
 agar aadhaar kii sari jaankaree, usase judaa mobile number, bank khaaton kii jaankaree li ho jaae to aap kis kanoon ke tahat court ke paas jaayenge ki aapaki niztaa yani privesi ke adhikaar kaa hanan hua he
 When we are expected in personal and public conduct to take care of each other's privacy, respect why it is not defined under the constitution or law
 jo sawaal soshal code kaa hissaa he, wo sawaal samvidhan kaa hissaa kyon nahin he
 This question was there earlier also but it has become very big in the digital era
 aap is jagat main lagaataar kisi apradhi kii tarah peechha kiye ja sakate hai
 a third eye is watching
 duniyabar main rose lakhon logon kii privesi par hamalaa hota he
 Collecting and selling information about people is a business in itself
 tabhi to aapke mobile par jab cell yaa kharido becho ke messej aane lagate hai to aap pareshaan ho jate hai
 For this, the telephone Regulatory of India has made an arrangement under which you can register that such messages are not sent to you
 yah aap isliye karte hai kyonki aap nahin chaahate ki koi aapaki niztaa main dakhal de
 Know that you have bought the freeze, now buy its cover too
 isliye supreme court main 9 jajon kii peeth 19 or 20 july ko manthan kar rahi he ki niztaa kaa adhikaar moulik adhikaar he yaa nahin
 a bench of eight judges in MP Sharma's case and a six-judge bench in Kharak Singh's case in 1962 ruled that the right to privacy was not a fundamental right
 iske baad bhi kai faisle aae hai jinamein adaalat ne niztaa ke adhikaar ko moulik adhikaar mana he
 On Wednesday, Gopal Subramaniam and Shyam Dewan argued for fundamental right to privacy
 bank se lekar mobile number tak aadhaar se joda ja rahaa he
 Is being made mandatory
 ham sab aadhaar card banavaa bhi rahe hai lekin kya ham is sawaal ko samaj paa rahe hai ki agar aadhaar kaa data li ho gaya, or sabko pataa chal gaya to aapke saath kya ho saktaa he
 Gopal Subramaniam said that the Preamble to the Constitution gives people the right to freedom of thought
 bagair azaadi or niztaa ke yah sambhav nahin he
 Freedom of thought will happen only when your privacy is protected and there is freedom
 privesi liberty kaa mul or anivaary tatv he
 One is not going to live in the shadow of any other authority
 liberty or privesi ke adhikaar hamen die nahin gaye hai balki ye pehle se maujuud hai
 These are natural rights
 gopal subramanyam ne kaha ki ham ye nahin kehete ki artical 21 ke tahat jeene ke adhikaar kaa dayera badhaayaa jaae balki jo adhikaar pehle se hai, unki pahchaan kii jaae, manyata di jaae
 Former Solicitor General Soli Sorabjee has said that the Right to Privacy is not written in the Constitution, it does not mean that it does not exist
 privesi har maanav vyaktitv kaa abhinn ang he
 Just as the Constitution does not give freedom of press under Article 19, it is seen as freedom of expression
 adaalaton ne bhi is baat ko hameshaa mana he
 Shyam Dewan said in his plea that on 16 March 2016 in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley had said that it is too late to say whether privacy is a fundamental right or not
 privesi shaayad ek moulik adhikaar he
 Right to privacy, article 14 of the constitution, right to equality, article 19 is a golden triangle of freedom of expression and right to live article 21
 aadhaar ke sabase bade samarthak nandan nilekani kaa intervyuu 19 july 2017 ke bijness standard main chapa he
 In this, what Nilekani has said, people have been expressing the same apprehensions about Aadhaar and privacy
 unhone kaha he ki sirf kuch digital platform ke paas data hona digital monopoli ko janm degaa
 Local companies were preferred in China but there are external companies in India which dominate the Internet world
 jaise fasebuk or google
 These companies also provide free service in lieu of data
 inke paas data he to vigyaapan bhi zyaada he
 There is no such policy in India where you know which data to share, which is private
 mujhe chintaa he ki ye data ab monopoli bana degaa or nayaa colonization model banegaa
 If the father of Aadhaar, Nilekani ji is saying that by gathering data, companies can create a new colony
 upnivesh matlab vahaan ke logon ko ghulaam bana lenaa jaise britain ne bharat ko apana upnivesh bana liya he
 If there is a danger that it should be clear for Internet companies as well as for Aadhaar what our rights of privacy are
 agar pehle se hai to kya hamen maaloom he ki iskaa koi company ulanghan karti he, agar sarkaar ke data bank se aadhaar kaa data li ho jaataa he to ek naagarik sarkaar par kis tarah se daawey kar saktaa he
 Under which law against internet company can he ask for his justice
 tippaniyan Nandan Nilekani's statement has been published in the Business Standard of 19 July in which he has said that a new law should be made about privacy so that the consumer, who is called a user, has control over his information
 kya ham jaanate hai ki digital india ke sarkari abhiyaan main videshi companiyaan hai yaa nahin agar hai to unka hamaare data par kis tarah kaa niyantran hoga
 Are Nilekani warning against Google and Facebook? china main fasebuk or google kaa apana sanskaran he
 The data of the people there is with the company sitting in America
 nilekani ne kaha he ki hamaare paas is par lagaam lagane ke liye koi kanoon nahin he
 If Nilekani feels that there should be a new law for privacy, it means that those who question the right to privacy and privacy regarding Aadhaar also seem to be in the right place
 isliye yah zaruri ho jaataa he ki niztaa ko paribhaashit kiya jaae
 His constitutionality should be clear
 26 janvari 1950 ke samvidhan lagu hone ke 67 saal baad bharat kii supreme court kii samvidhan peeth is baat par vichaar kar rahi he ki niztaa, privesi aapkaa moulik adhikaar he yaa nahin
 This question has come up in the context of Aadhaar in front of the Bench of 9 judges
 kai chizon main aadhaar ke anivaary kiye jane ko chunauti dene vaali yachika main yah sawaal uthaa he ki aadhaar ke baad kisi kaa kisi se pardaa nahin rahegaa
 Privacy will end
 yah moulik aadhaar kaa hanan he
 That is why it is being considered whether privacy is a fundamental right
 agar aadhaar kii sari jaankaree, usase judaa mobile number, bank khaaton kii jaankaree li ho jaae to aap kis kanoon ke tahat court ke paas jaayenge ki aapaki niztaa yani privesi ke adhikaar kaa hanan hua he
 When we are expected in personal and public conduct to take care of each other's privacy, respect why it is not defined under the constitution or law
 jo sawaal soshal code kaa hissaa he, wo sawaal samvidhan kaa hissaa kyon nahin he
 This question was there earlier also but it has become very big in the digital era
 aap is jagat main lagaataar kisi apradhi kii tarah peechha kiye ja sakate hai
 a third eye is watching
 duniyabar main rose lakhon logon kii privesi par hamalaa hota he
 Collecting and selling information about people is a business in itself
 tabhi to aapke mobile par jab cell yaa kharido becho ke messej aane lagate hai to aap pareshaan ho jate hai
 For this, the telephone Regulatory of India has made an arrangement under which you can register that such messages are not sent to you
 yah aap isliye karte hai kyonki aap nahin chaahate ki koi aapaki niztaa main dakhal de
 Know that you have bought the freeze, now buy its cover too
 isliye supreme court main 9 jajon kii peeth 19 or 20 july ko manthan kar rahi he ki niztaa kaa adhikaar moulik adhikaar he yaa nahin
 a bench of eight judges in MP Sharma's case and a six-judge bench in Kharak Singh's case in 1962 ruled that the right to privacy was not a fundamental right
 iske baad bhi kai faisle aae hai jinamein adaalat ne niztaa ke adhikaar ko moulik adhikaar mana he
 On Wednesday, Gopal Subramaniam and Shyam Dewan argued for fundamental right to privacy
 bank se lekar mobile number tak aadhaar se joda ja rahaa he
 Is being made mandatory
 ham sab aadhaar card banavaa bhi rahe hai lekin kya ham is sawaal ko samaj paa rahe hai ki agar aadhaar kaa data li ho gaya, or sabko pataa chal gaya to aapke saath kya ho saktaa he
 Gopal Subramaniam said that the Preamble to the Constitution gives people the right to freedom of thought
 bagair azaadi or niztaa ke yah sambhav nahin he
 Freedom of thought will happen only when your privacy is protected and there is freedom
 privesi liberty kaa mul or anivaary tatv he
 One is not going to live in the shadow of any other authority
 liberty or privesi ke adhikaar hamen die nahin gaye hai balki ye pehle se maujuud hai
 These are natural rights
 gopal subramanyam ne kaha ki ham ye nahin kehete ki artical 21 ke tahat jeene ke adhikaar kaa dayera badhaayaa jaae balki jo adhikaar pehle se hai, unki pahchaan kii jaae, manyata di jaae
 Former Solicitor General Soli Sorabjee has said that the Right to Privacy is not written in the Constitution, it does not mean that it does not exist
 privesi har maanav vyaktitv kaa abhinn ang he
 Just as the Constitution does not give freedom of press under Article 19, it is seen as freedom of expression
 adaalaton ne bhi is baat ko hameshaa mana he
 Shyam Dewan said in his plea that on 16 March 2016 in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley had said that it is too late to say whether privacy is a fundamental right or not

 Right to privacy, article 14 of the constitution, right to equality, article 19 is a golden triangle of freedom of expression and right to live article 21

 isliye yah zaruri ho jaataa he ki niztaa ko paribhaashit kiya jaae
 His constitutionality should be clear
 yah sawaal pehle bhi tha magar digital daur main kaaphi bada ho gaya he
 You can be chased like a criminal continuously in this world
 ek teesri aankh dekh rahi hoti he
 The privacy of millions of people is attacked everyday around the world
 logon ke bare main jaankaree jamaa karnaa or use chura kar bechnaa, yah apane aap main ek dhandha he
 That's why when you start selling or buying messages on your mobile, then you get upset
 iske liye telephone regulatory of india ne ek vyavastha kii he jiske tahat aap darj kara sakate hai ki aapako is tarah ke messej nahin bheje jaaen
 You do this because you do not want someone to interfere in your privacy
 koi jane ki aapane freez karidaa he, ab uskaa cover bhi kareed lijie
 Therefore, a bench of 9 judges in the Supreme Court is churning on 19 and 20 July whether the right to privacy is a fundamental right or not
 empi sharma ke cese main aath jajon kii peeth or1962 main kharag singh ke cese main chah jajon kii peeth ne faisla diya tha ki niztaa kaa adhikaar moulik adhikaar nahin he
 Even after this, many decisions have come in which the court has considered the right to privacy as a fundamental right
 buudhvaar ko gopal subramanyam or shyaam dewan ne niztaa ko moulik adhikaar ke liye bahes kii
 Aadhaar is being linked from bank to mobile number
 anivaary kiya ja rahaa he
 We are all getting Aadhaar cards also made, but are we able to understand the question of what can happen to you if Aadhaar's data was leaked, and everyone gets to know
 gopal subramanyam ne kaha ki samvidhan kii prastaavna main logon ko sochane kii azaadi kaa adhikaar detii he
 This is not possible without freedom and privacy
 vichaaron kii swatantraaa tabhi hogi jab aapaki privesi surakshit rahe or azaadi ho
 Privacy is the basic and essential element of Liberty
 kisi duusare adhikaar kii chaaya main rahane vaala nahin he
 The rights of Liberty and Privacy are not given to us, rather they already exist
 ye swaabhaavik adhikaar hai
 Gopal Subramaniam said that we do not say that the scope of the right to live under Article 21 should be increased but the rights which already exist should be recognized, recognized
 purv solicytor general soli psorabji ne kaha he ki samvidhan main rhite tu privesi nahin likhaa he, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki ye he hi nahin
 Privacy is an integral part of every human personality
 jaise samvidhan artical 19 ke tahat press kii azaadi kaa adhikaar nahin detaa, use abhivyakti kii azaadi kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 The courts have also always considered this
 shyaam dewan ne apni daleel main kaha ki rajya sabha main 16 march 2016 ko arun jetali ne kaha tha ki ab ye kehane main ki privesi moulik adhikaar he yaa nahin, kaaphi der ho chuki he
 Privacy is probably a fundamental right
 rhite tu privesi, samvidhan ke artical 14, samanta ke adhikaar, artical 19 abhivyakti kii azaadi or artikil 21 jeene ke adhikaar ke sunahare trikon se mila he
 The interview of Nandan Nilekani, the biggest proponent of Aadhaar, was featured in the Business Standard on 19 July 2017
 isamen nilekani ne jo kaha he vahi ashankaayen aadhaar or privesi ko lekar log vyakt karte aa rahe hai
 He has said that having data on only a few digital platforms will give rise to digital monopoly
 china main local companiyon ko tavajjo di gai lekin bharat main bahari companiyaan hai jo internet kii duniya main chai hui hai
 Like Facebook and Google
 ye companiyaan bhi data ke badale free sarvice detii hai
 If they have data, advertising is more
 bharat main aisi koi niti nahin he jahaan pataa ho ki koun sa data share karnaa he, koun sa nijee he
 i am worried that this data will now create monopoly and a new colonization model
 agar aadhaar ke janak nilekani ji yah baat kah rahe hai ki data jutakar companiyaan nayaa upnivesh bana sakati hai
 Colonization means enslaving people there like Britain has made India its colony
 agar ye khatara he ki internet companiyon ke liye bhi or aadhaar ke liye bhi yah saaf hona chahie ki privesi niztaa ke hamaare adhikaar kya hai
 If already, do we know if a company violates it, how can a citizen claim the government if Aadhaar data gets leaked from the government's data bank
 internet company ke khilaaf kis kanoon ke tahat wo apana insaaf maang saktaa he
 The comments 19 july ke bijness standard main nandan nilekani kaa bayaan chapa he jisamen unhone kaha he ki privesi ko lekar nayaa kanoon bananaa chahie taaki upabhokta jise yuzar kehete hai, uskaa niyantran ho apni jaankaree par
 Do we know if there are foreign companies in the Digital India government campaign or not, if they have any kind of control over our data
 kya nilekani google or fasebuk se aagaah kar rahe hai
 Facebook and Google have their own version in China
 vahaan ke logon kaa data america main baithi company ke paas he
 Nilekani has said that we do not have any law to curb this
 agar nilekani ko lagata he ki privesi ke liye nayaa kanoon hona chahie to iskaa matlab he ki aadhaar ko lekar privesi, niztaa ke adhikaar kaa sawaal uthaane vaale bhi sahi jagah par lagate hai
 Therefore it becomes necessary to define privacy
 uski sanvaidhaniktaa saaf saaf ho
 Therefore, a bench of 9 judges in the Supreme Court is churning on 19 and 20 July whether the right to privacy is a fundamental right or not

 19 july ke bijness standard main nandan nilekani kaa bayaan chapa he jisamen unhone kaha he ki privesi ko lekar nayaa kanoon bananaa chahie taaki upabhokta jise yuzar kehete hai, uskaa niyantran ho apni jaankaree par
 Do we know if there are foreign companies in the Digital India government campaign or not, if they have any kind of control over our data
 kya nilekani google or fasebuk se aagaah kar rahe hai
 Facebook and Google have their own version in China
 vahaan ke logon kaa data america main baithi company ke paas he
 Nilekani has said that we do not have any law to curb this
 agar nilekani ko lagata he ki privesi ke liye nayaa kanoon hona chahie to iskaa matlab he ki aadhaar ko lekar privesi, niztaa ke adhikaar kaa sawaal uthaane vaale bhi sahi jagah par lagate hai
 Therefore it becomes necessary to define privacy
 uski sanvaidhaniktaa saaf saaf ho
 If Nilekani feels that there should be a new law for privacy, it means that those who question the right to privacy and privacy regarding Aadhaar also seem to be in the right place
 isliye yah zaruri ho jaataa he ki niztaa ko paribhaashit kiya jaae

 match kaa nateeja chaahe jo hota lekin itihaas likhaa janaa tay tha
 At the Sydney Cricket Ground, such a huge score was achieved only once, so the pressure was on Team India
 shikhar dhawan or rohit sharma par isi dabaav ko kam karne kii zimmedaari thi or donon ne shuruuaat team india ke haq main hi kii
 shikhar-rohit's big start was the opening of Team India with some thinking
 wicket par tikna zaruri tha or tej ran bananaa behad zaruri
 Something similar started
 pehle teen over tak donon ne sanbhal-sanbhal kar hi ballebaazi kii
 In the fourth over of the innings, wicketkeeper Brad Haddin missed the catch of Shikhar Dhawan off Hazelwood
 shikhar us samay 5 par khel rahe the
 It was a big living for Team India, which Shikhar Dhawan took advantage of
 shikhar or rohit ne kareeb 6 kii ausat se damdaar ballebaazi kii
 Shikhar Dhawan completed 50 runs of Team India with two fours and a six in the 10th over
 iske baad ran rate or badha, 13wein over tak bharat 76 ran bana chukaa tha lekin isi score par shikhar dhawan galati kar gaye
 Australia returned to the match, Hazelwood's fifth ball of the 13th over, Shikhar Dhawan tried to drive over the extra cover but Maxwell was probably held to the same shot on the deep extra cover
 41 gendon par 45 ran banane ke baad shikhar kii ye galati team india ko baari pad gai
 After 2 runs, Virat Kohli was given away by Mitchell Johnson
 johnson kii bounsar ko pul karne kii koshish kar rahe viraat ke balle kaa upree kinaaraa lekar gend wicketiper hedin ke paas gai or viraat kii pari kaa ant ho gaya
 No one expected a batsman like Virat to score 1 off 13 balls in such a big match
 johnson ke is shandaar spel kaa shikaar rohit sharma bhi ho gaye
 Playing fiercely on 34 runs, Rohit took the ball to Johnson, taking the inner edge of his bat
 iske baad suresh raina bhi aae or sirf 7 ran banaakar james foconor kii gend par wicketiper hedin ko kaich thama baithe
 After losing 4 wickets at 108, Team India was in serious trouble
 dhoni-rahane par ai badi zimmedaaricaptain ke sir par ab bahut badi zimmedaari thi or ajinkya rahane ke paas ek bahut bada mauka tha
 The pressure of the run rate was skyrocketing and making a quick run was a big challenge
 aise main donon ne kareeb 5
 Started scoring at an average of 30
 13
 In 2 overs, both shared a 70-run partnership
 is dauraan bharat ne 150 ran kaa aankada bhi paar kar liya
 Rahane was beaten by a Mitchell Starc ball after scoring 44 runs in the 37th over but wicketkeeper Brad Hedin appealed the catch and Michael Clarke took the review
 tivi riple se kuch khaas pataa nahin chalaa lekin snicometer bataa rahaa tha ki gend rahane ke balle kaa bahari kinaaraa lekar wicketiper ke paas gai thi
 The third umpire called Rahane out
 178 par bharat ko laga ye paanchvaan jhatka tha
 Dhoni's effort Nakamjadeja was also run out after scoring 18 off 17 balls in the 42nd over
 musiibat kii ghadi main captain dhoni ne ek chor thama hua tha
 After 40 overs, Team India had to score at an average of around 12
 41wein over main bharat ke 200 ran puure hue
 Dhoni also hit big shots in between, but all this was proving inadequate for India
 dhoni ne 55 gendon par 3 chaukon or 1 chakke kii madad se apni half centuri bhi puri kar lee
 Ultimately, Dhoni's struggle ended in the 45th over
 93 gendon par 65 ran kii pari khilne ke baad dhoni maxwell ek shandaar thro par ranout ho gaye
 He played Stark's ball at midwicket and ran to take a single but before that the ball went to the wicket
 nahin bachaa bharat kaa tajdhoni ke jane ke baad team india kii haar bas ek aupchaarkita maatr hi bachi thi
 Dhoni's wicket fell at a score of 231 and the remaining three batsmen were also dismissed in the next 2 runs
 aswin ne 5 ran banaae to mohit sharma or umesh yadav khaataa tak nahin khol paae
 Mohammad Shami remained unbeaten on 1 run
 australian gendbaazon ne bharat par jamkar kahar barapaaya
 Faulkner took 3 wickets, Johnson and Stark 2–2, Hazelwood got one wicket
 95 ranon kii haar ke saath hi bharat ne final main khilne kaa mauka bhi kho diya or vishwavijeta kaa taj bhi On Navy Day, some leaders and parties shared the picture of a warship and congratulated the Indian Navy
