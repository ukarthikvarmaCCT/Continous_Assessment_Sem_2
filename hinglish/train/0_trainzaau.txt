 Before this meeting, party leaders Manish Sisodia, Gopal Rai, Pankaj Gupta and Sanjay Singh issued statements and attacked Prashant Bhushan Shanti and Yogendra Yadav
 ye hai yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan par AAP ke aaropabayaan main kaha gaya he ki ye dukh kii baat he ki jab sab kaaryakarta apana pasinaa baha rahe the, to hamaari party ke ye senior netaa party ko kamjor karne or party ko haraane main lage the
 Those who wanted to donate money to the party, Prashant Bhushan also prevented those people from giving money
 yogendra yadav ne arvind kii chhavi kharaab karne ke liye akhbaar main negative khabaren chhapavain
 The statement said that Aavam is an organization of the BJP and was supported by Prashant Bhushan
 i welcome the statement by 4 colleagues
 Begins the possibility of open, transparent dialogue
 Truth shall prevail
 - Yogendra Yadav (@aapyogendra) March 10, 2015hope this statement ends all slander, planting of allegations
 Hope no more coercion of party functionaries and Delhi mlas on this issue
 - Yogendra Yadav (@aapyogendra) March 10, 2015hope PB and my response will also be duly publicized by the party media
 Hope party's website will be opened for all volunteers responses
 - Yogendra Yadav (@aapyogendra) March 10, 2015 At the end of the statement it is said that the National Executive decided to give a new responsibility by freeing both senior colleagues from the party's PAC by a majority
 party ye baat pehle khulkar nahin kah rahi thi, lekin in teenon kii lagaataar koshishon ko dekhakar party ne ye nirnay saarvajanik karne kaa faisla liya he
 Actually, the Aam Aadmi Party had issued a statement about the three leaders
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki party ne yah sochakar yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ko piesi se hataane ke kaarnon ko saarvajanik nahin kiya ki usase in donon ke vyaktitv par vipareet asar padegaa, lekin baithak ke baad media main lagaataar bayaan de kar maahaul banaaya ja rahaa he jaise rashtriya kaaryakarini ne aloktantric or gairjimmedaar tareeke se yah faisla liya
 Looking at the media, the question has also arisen among the workers that what is the reason for removing them from the PAC
 party ke khilaaf media main banaaye ja rahe maahaul se majaboor hokar party ko donon varisht saathiyon ko piesi se hathaaye jane ke kaarnon ko saarvajanik karne ke liye majaboor hona pad rahaa he
 Party leader Sanjay Singh told Aaj Tak that the way Mayank Gandhi Bhai's blog and Prashant, Yogendra Yadav was giving TV interviews, there was a misunderstanding among the activists
 prashanth bhushan aam aadmi party ko haraane main jutethe, wo bijepi ko kyon jeetaana chaahate the? is baat kaa paalan kisne kiya, yogendra ne khub intervyuu die, sachai kya he saamne aana chahie
 Prashant Bhushan said in the PAC meeting that ruin this party
 jis tarah kaa bayaan inaki taraf se aayaa usase party ko kaaphi nuksaan hua
 Prashant Bhushan told Ashish Khaitan that Arvind Kejriwal's mind would be fine if he gets 20-22 seats
 aage jo faisla hoga, us par party nirnay karegi
 In politics, one party's dispute is a tool of attack for another
 aise main jaahir he ki duusari partiyaan aam aadmi party ke is bavaal par kaise peeche rah sakati he
 Congress and BJP have targeted Kejriwal & Co
 on this matter
 bijepi kii shajia ilmi ne kaha ki aam aadmi party main arvind kejariwal hi sab kuch hai
 Amidst all this, Aam Aadmi Party's popular leader Kumar Vishwas has said that it was decided in the party meeting to remain calm, but this is not the way all people are speaking
 bada netaa ho yaa chota anushaasan se upar koi nahin
 Keep talking in the party forum, we can sit again, sit in the PAC

 com / 51eoytzm6g— ANI (@ani_news)february 29, 2016 Congress President Rahul Gandhi's temple vision seems to be successful with the results of the five state assembly elections
 rahul gandhi ne paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke dauraan ek ke baad ek kai mandiron main jaakar darshan kiye
 This snatched away the bjp's opportunity to project the Congress and the Gandhi family as an anti-hindu and Muslim party
 2019 ke elaan-e-jang se pehle khatre main 'brands modi'!shivbhakt rahul ko mil gaya bhole kaa aashirwad?bijepi kii haar main berogari, kisaanon kii naaraazgi or bhrashtachar mukhya kaaran rahe lekin iske alaava congress ne bijepi ko uske trump card hindutv par bhi baaji nahin maarane di
 Rahul Gandhi's temple run continued from the beginning to the end of the campaign for the five state assembly elections
 rahul gandhi chitrakoot ke kamalnath mandir, vishwakarma mandir bhopal, datia kii maa peetambari peeth or gwalior ke gopal mandir, achaleshwar mandir or ujjain ke mahakaal mandir pahunche
 He also took part in the Narmada Aarti
 yahi nahin, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne haal hi main behad kathin maani jane vaali kailash maansarovar yatra bhi kii thi
 After this journey, Rahul came to be called Shiva devotee
 jab rahul ne chitrakoot kaa daura kiya to unhen rambhakt bhi pukaara gaya
 At the same time, Congress's Madhya Pradesh president Kamal Nath promised to build a cowshed in every village
 congress party ne ram gaman van path yatra bhi shuru kii
 Mandate of Hindi belt: Now can not ignore these 5 questions, Narendra Modi had told that there was a lot of controversy about Rahul Gandhi telling his gotra in the last phase of his gotra election
 vipakshi dal aksar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke gotra par sawaal uthaate rahete hai jiskaa jawaab rahul gandhi ne pushkar ke brahma mandir main khud ko kaul brahman or dattatreya gotra se puja kar diya
 Earlier in the Karnataka assembly elections, Rahul Gandhi has described himself as a Janeudhari Brahmin
 duusari taraf, bijepi ne hindutv ke prakhar chehre or upi siem yogi adityanath ko sabhi chunavi rajyon ke campan main utaara
 However, this time the bjp's Hindutva card did not work and Rahul Gandhi's temple philosophy brought the Congress ahead of the BJP
 kai vishlashakon kaa maananaa he ki bijepi ke hindutv card kaa jawaab congress soft hindutv se hi de sakati he
 After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, the Congress has moved out of its secular image and is moving towards soft Hindutva
 majboot hui congress, janadesh ne khole mahagathbandhan ke dwargujrat vidhansabha chunaav se shuru hua tha mandir darshan-gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan se hi congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi lagaataar bijepi ke kattar hindutv se muqabla karne ke liye soft hindutv kii raah par chal rahe hai
 In Gujarat, Rahul visited and visited about 28 temples
 rahul gandhi ne chunavi campan ke dauraan khud ko shivbhakt bhi bataaya tha
 The Congress had released a photograph of Rahul's Janeu when there was a dispute during Rahul Gandhi's visit to Somnath in Gujarat
 gujarat chunaav main rahul ke mandir se siyasat vaale formule se party ko phayda mila tha
 This is the reason why the Congress tried Rahul's temple darshan yatra in Karnataka, even though the Congress could not emerge as the largest party, but managed to prevent the BJP from coming to power

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi today said that the Congress, Third Front and other parties have started giving up even before the campaign for Lok Sabha elections is over
 isaliye sthir sarkaar naa bane, isaki maala pherane main lage hai
 Modi said at an election rally here that as soon as the election comes, the Congress starts remembering the poor
 vah ‘garib-garib’ kii maala pherane main jute jaati he, lekin sone kaa chammach lekar paidaa hone vaale log garibon kaa dard kya samajhenge
 The Congress, the Third Front and other parties have accepted their defeat
 isliye sthir sarkaar na banane dene ke liye sabhi ‘funda’ apanaae ja rahe hai
 The BJP leader alleged that the Congress-led government at the Center did not distribute wheat lying idle in the godowns to the poor even on the orders of the Supreme Court, but the wheat was sold to the liquor mafia at the rate of 80-90 paise per kg
 unhone kaha, congress ne bareli ko bhula diya, raibareli ko yaad rakhaa
 Everyone knows what the region got in the last five years
 ab bareli main jhumkaa nahin ‘sabakaa’ giregaa
 'S' means SP, 'B' means BSP and 'ka' means Congress
 ‘sabakaa’ safaya jaruri he
 Farewell to them all together

 Bareilly is used as Manjha in Gujarat
 bareli ke maanjha ke bagaiyr gujarat kii patang adhuri he
 The Gujarat Chief Minister said that Kite's business was worth Rs 35 crore when he took over in Gujarat
 ab vah 500 karod rupee tak pahunch gaya he
 Modi said that when the name of the prime ministerial candidate was being announced in the BJP, the Congress and its allies were saying that there would be a fierce battle in the BJP
 naam ghoshit hote hi prachaar shuru kiya ki koi sahyogi nahin milegaa, lekin uttar se lekar dakshin tak darjan bhar nae saathi bhaajapa ko mil chuke hai
 That is why Congress and UPA leaders are trying to create instability but these tricks will not work
 uttar pradesh main sattarudh sapa ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav tathaa unke kunbe par hamalaa karte hue unhone kaha, uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri hamase sher maang rahe the
 We thought that by seeing this, they would suffocate
 lekin gujarat ke sher ko sanbhaalanaa unke bas kaa rog nahin he
 That is why they have decided that they are afraid of this lion and will have to keep it in the cage
 modi ne kaha netaji (mulaayam), aapke suputr (akhilesh), bahuji (dimpal) or bhai sahab
 
 
 Once the whole family comes to the forests of Gir, the lion roams there fearlessly
 hamen use pinjaron main nahin band karnaa padataa
 Sheradil, the lion of Gujarat, wants to live with the people
 unhone kaha ki purv pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri ne desh ko ‘jai jawan, jai kisaan’ kaa mantra diya tha
 There was a time when Hindustan used to get grains from abroad
 shastri ji ke aahwan par kisaanon ne itnaa pasinaa bahaya ki ann ke bhandar bhar die
 Modi said, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan was shown live by the jawans and farmers, but whether Jai Jawan or Jai Kisan is seen under Congress rule
 hindustan ke javaanon ke sir pakistan katkar le jaae or dilli kii sarkaar haath par haath dhare baithi he
 The government also seems to have succumbed to the Naxalites
 railway ne faisla kiya he ki naksal prabhavit ilaakon se philhal raat main trene nahin guzrengi
 Train drivers have also refused to run trains at night in these areas
 khadgpur ke paas hue train haadase ke baad driveron main dar baitha he
 Apparently the fear of drivers and railways is showing the failure of the government
 driveron kii esoshiation ne faisla kiya he ki jab tak unhen suraksha nahin muhaiyaa karai jaati he tab tak ve naksali ilaakon main raat ke samay train nahin chalaayenge
 Meanwhile, so far 73 deaths have been reported in the Gyaneshwari Express train accident
 naksaliyon kii naaraazgi sarkaar or prashasan se he lekin is haadase main agar kisi ne jaan ganvaai he to wo koi or nahin aam insaan he
 The disturbing thing is that the Naxalites have taken the army and police as well as the general public on their target for the last few months
 pichley ek saal main naksaliyon ne aath hamale aise kiye hai jiname jaan gai he to sirf or sirf aam logon kii
 It is clear that now the danger has increased for the general public
 bahut zyada vakt nahin beetaa he jab 17 may ko naksaliyon ne chhattisgarh main bam blast se ek bas ko uda diya tha jisame 40 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Even before this, Naxalites have killed 58 innocents in 8 attacks in several parts of Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh till 22 April 2009
 kaha ja rahaa he ki naksaliyon kaa gussa sarkaar ke oparation greenhunt ke khilaaf he
 After the developments so far, it is clear that the government has failed in its mission to rein in the Naxalites
 usase bhi bada khatra ye he ki ab desh ke liye nasoor ban chukaa ye laal saazish aam janata ke khun se apane haath laal kar rahaa he

 main to chalaa, jidhar chale rasta
 Whatever work was done, he did it
 main apane desh ke liye sarvshereshth kaam karne main bharosa karata hum
 Rejecting speculation about BJP making him prime ministerial candidate, Gadkari clarified that "there is nothing in my mind nor any such intention of the Sangh"

 Honeytrap investigations are taking place everyday
 Shocking revelations were being made by the company
 The Honeytrap gang was setting up a target, the political cell of the head of the cell and STF has been hit by political mercury after the revelation of the Honeytrap scandal in Madhya Pradesh
 kamalnath sarkaar ko is cond ne hilaakar rakh diya he
 BJP is also not untouched by this
 ham bataa rahe hai aise teen alag-alag maamle, jinke taar aapas main jude to saamne aayaa desh kaa sabase bada sex scandle, jisamen netaa, afasar, patrkaar or enjio lagbhag har varg ke log sanlipt paae gaye
 The scandal began when mp's cyber cell and a senior in the STF came in contact with Aarti Dayal, who was caught in the IPS honeytrap, according to leaked sources
 ye kareeb ek saal pehle kii baat he
 At that time elections were going on in the state
 26 july 2019 ko aarti ne shweta vijay jain ke saath milakar 10 lakh rupee kii puunji se ek technology company shuru kii
 This new company was partnered with an old company
 puraani company bengalooru besd thim or sibar takanic ke kshetra main kaam karti thi
 The owner of this company is also on the radar of the agencies investigating the case
 aarti or shweta vijay jain kii company kaa kaam to tha sibar security, sibar forensik or mobile security lekin hakeekat main yahaan kuch or hi hona tha
 As a result of the partnership with the old company, the intervention of these new companies was extended to the cyber headquarters located on Bhadbhada Road in Bhopal
 is company ke jariye netaaon or afasaron ke phone va chating par najar rakhi jane lagi
 Chats, calls were recorded with SMS
 gajiabad main liya gaya guest housebhi haal hi main dilli-ensiaar ke gajiabad main sibar cell ne ek guest house kiraye par liya tha
 The rent of this guest house was being given from the government money
 niyamanusaar, sibar cell ke mukhiya ko isaki jaankaree sarkaar or police vibhaag ke mukhiya ko deni thi lekin aisa nahin kiya gaya
 The guest house was also evacuated after the dispute arose on this matter
 maamle ko puraa jaanane ke liye dekhen :hanitrap maamle main IPS afasaron main bayaanbaji, DGP ko hataane kii mangesies iees adhikari kaa video hua tha viral26 july ko iti company register hone ke baad ek ghatana ne madhya pradesh kii siyasat main halchal machaane vaali ek ghatana ghat gai
 The video of an Additional Chief Secretary (ACS) level IAS officer went viral after 26 July
 isamen yah adhikari ek mahila ke saath aapattijanak sthiti main dikhaai de rahe the
 After the video went viral, the government took information about the entire case and on July 29, Chief Minister Kamal Nath ordered an inquiry
 maamle ko puraa jaanane ke liye dekhen :hani trep kesah MP main raajnneetik bhuuchaal, hai-profile mahila giraftarajise hi asies kaa video viral hua to siem kamalnath kii jaankaree main isaki jaanch hui
 Then the government came to know about the nexus between the top police officers and the blackmailing gang
 phir is gathjod par nigaah rakhi jane lagi
 Plans were made to completely demolish this alliance
 uske baad indore nagar nigam main suparident ejeeniyar harbhajan singh kaa maamla saamne aa gaya
 The government, having already looked into the matter, revealed the entire honeytrap gang
 iske baad hanitrap gang kii members se poochtacha hui to usamen jo khulaase hue, usase sarkaar bhi hairaan rah gai
 In this, along with the BJP leaders, the names of Congress leaders also came out
 dekhne main to yah teenon maamle alag lagate hai lekin kahin na kahin inke taar aapas main jude hue hai
 In which a senior IPS Honeytrap has a deep connection
 is maamle ko puraa jaanane ke liye dekhen :MP hani trep cese: BJP ne kii CBI jaanch kii maang, congress ne saadhaa nishanakaise hua tha hanitrap kaa khulaasa?darasal 18 sitambar ko indore police ne do mahilaon or unke vaahan chaalak ko giraftaar kiya tha
 After making a video of Municipal Engineer Harbhajan Singh, these women blackmailed him and demanded three crore rupees from him
 maangi gai rakam kii pehali kisht ke taur par 50 lakh rupee ve lene ain to pakadi gayi
 After that the strings of many leaders kept connecting with this scandal
 baad main is cond se judi jo tasviir saamne aa rahi he, vah chaunkaane vaali he
 At the same time it is realizing that in the last several years in the state, contracts worth crores were handed over to those who made full use of women
 is maamle kii jaanch ab esaiti (vishesh jaanch team) ko saunp di gai he
 Along with this, the names of leaders of ruling party Congress and opposition party BJP have started joining this honeytrap sex scandal
 abhi tak kisi bhi netaa par police ne to ungali nahin uthaai he, magar galiyaaron main charchaa yahi he ki hanitrap sex cond kii mahilaon se netaaon ke rishte rahe hai
 Could this ruin the career of many politicians-officers? The clues that the police have revealed reveal that the honeytrap sex scandal is not just five women, but their gang members spread to small districts Are, which were used in their own way from time to time
 pehle sambandhit netaa athwa afasar ko khush karke theka yaa duusare kaam manjuur karaae jate the or jisase yah kaam nahin ho paata tha use blekamel karne kii dhamkee dekar rakam vasuuli jaati thi
 Not only this, these women also played a big role in posting of big officers
 is maamle ko puraa jaanane ke liye dekhen :babulal gaur the hani trep ke pehle shikaar, bijepi ne khelaa tha khel : congressutron kaa daawa he ki agar jaanch sahi hui or raajnneetik dakhal nahin rahaa, to kai aise netaaon or afasaron ke chehre benakaab honge, jinka apane-apane kshetra main kariyar abhi bahut lanbaa he or ve vartmaan main bhi pramukh pad par hai
 Among the people whose names are coming out, there are a large number of leaders associated with both Congress and BJP parties, the police has got more than 100 videos and more than 200 such phone numbers, which can create a political storm
 jindagi or maut ke bich sirf ek sahi kadam kaa faasla hota he
 If you turn wrong from wherever you are, then this life can also end
 ye baat main khud se nahin kah rahi hum balki film hotel mumbai ne mujhe aaj sikhaai he
 It is still difficult for people to forget that painful terrorist attack in Mumbai on 26 November 2008
 khaskar wo log jo mumbai main rahe, jinhone us hamale se khud ko kisi tarah bachaaya or jinhone apane saamne logon ko marate hue dekha
 These are the same people whose one evening of life took away everything from them and changed everything forever
 film hotel mumbai kii kahani 2009 main ai documentry cerviving mumbai se prerit he
 This is the story of the tragic terrorist attack at the Taj Hotel on 26 November 2008, in which hotel guests, staff and Mumbai Police lost their lives
 iske saath hi is film main 26 november ke hi din hui chhatrapati shivaji stesan or leopold cafe main hue aatanki hamale ko bhi kuch had tak dikhaaya gaya he
 The film's director Anthony Maras has told in many of his interviews that he had decided to hide the identity of the real people in the hotel at the time of the attack and hence all the characters shown in the story are fictional, inspired by real life people Has been coined haalanki taj hotel ke head shef hemanth oberoi yani anupam kher kaa kirdaar asli he
 Story: The story begins with Arjun (dev Patel) who lives in Mumbai
 uski bivi pregnent he or ek choti bacchee bhi uske paas he
 Arjun is an employee of the Taj Hotel, who arrives at work that day in the wrong footwear
 head shef oberoi use ghar jane ko kehete hai lekin wo unase darkhwaast karata he ki use is shift kii jarurat he, use kaam karne diya jaae
 At the same time, David Duncan and Zahra (army Hammer and Nazneen Bonaidi) arrive at the hotel with their son and his nanny Sally (tilda kohm-harvie)
 david or jaharaa hotel ke shaamiyane main dinar kar rahe hote hai jab taj hotel par aatanki hamalaa hota he
 Fantastic Hai directionsthe film is very beautifully made
 har ek seen dar or dehshat se bharaa he, jo aapako man hi man dua karne ke liye majaboor karata he
 It is very scary for terrorists to reach Mumbai comfortably and then get mixed up with the general public and take a taxi to their location
 film jaise-jaise aage badhati he or taj hotel main hone vaala haadasa or bhi gambhir, dardanaak or daraavna hone lagata he
 There is not a moment when you are breathing properly while sitting in the theater
 ye film aapako apane saath aise jodatii he ki aapako lagegaa ki aap us samay us hotel ke kisi kamare main ho or baahar ek 16 saal ke bachche ke rup main maut khadi he
 You connect with the characters and consider each of their steps as their own
 us kirdaar ko chot laganaa aapke sharir kii chot ban jaataa he
 Director Anthony Maras is the first film as a director and he has done a great job in it
 film main shaayad hi koi pal he jab aap usase jude naa rahen or dare naa rahen
 The film's editing is very beautiful
 badhiya cinematography, sound dizin or becoground score film ko real banaate hai
 How's the performance: The actors of the film Dev Patel, Anupam Kher, Army Hammer, Nazneen Bonaidi, Tilda kohm-harvi and Jacob Isaac have given a good performance
 inkaa dar, kanfusion or painic dekhne laayak he or in sabhi kii acting is film ko behtareen banaati he
 Seeing this, you will not be able to stop your emotions and your tears
 kul-milakar ye ek dil dahala dene vaali khubsuurati se banaai gai film he, jise aapako jarur dekhnaa chahie
 Time magazine has named Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement as one of the 10 biggest news stories of the year

 Anna's anti-corruption movement has been included in the list of the 10 largest world news
 is andolan kii khabar ko anna ke anshan ne bharat ko jhakzora shishark se prakashit kiya gaya he
 The magazine wrote that protests took place in many countries of the world this year, but the movement that brought dissatisfaction to the forefront most effectively was Anna's non-violent movement

 According to the magazine, Anna's fast brought a large gathering with him in many cities of the country

 In August, a survey of India's top 100 business schools by web portal mbauniverse
com and assessment company Merit Track revealed that most of the mbas who pass out in India are not fit for a job
 haalanki, is baat kii jaankaree kai employrs ko pehle se hi thi
 The survey included 2,264 MBA students from 29 cities, which showed that all the schools, other than the top 25 business schools, were able to employ only 21 percent of their graduates
 survey main emb graduate kii emloybility (naukari ke laayak hone kii yogyata) ko 26 se 100 ke bich ranking di gai thi
 This showed that in 2012, the amiability fell further to just 21 per cent as compared to 25 per cent in the previous 2007 survey
 isi dauraan desh main emb siton kii sankhya 95,000 se badhkar 3,50,000 tak pahunch gai
 In this way, the number of seats increased by 30 percent every year
 lekin emb ajukeshan kii quality is teji se nahin bad pai
 It is the same type of disease that afflicts India's entire higher education sector
 teji se badhati maang ko puraa karne ke liye supplai to badhati gai he, lekin quality control kii vyavastha na hone se haalat yah he ki bharat ke lakhon naujavaanon ke paas degree jarur he, lekin ve kisi laayak nahin hai
 However, the study of management in India's best quality best institutions is actually quite different from the broader higher education sector
 bijness today kii 2012 kii ranking main top par rahane vaale iiem-ahmedabad ko pratishthit financial times (apat) kii duniya ke best bijness skulon kii ranking top 10 main jagah mili he
 Similarly, in the QS 200 ranking of Global Business Schools in 2012, iim-ahmedabad has been ranked second in the asia-pacific region
 cues kii ranking main asia-prashanth ke top 36 main chah bhartiya bijness skool shaamil kiye gaye hai, jinhone duniya ke top 200 bijness skulon main bhi jagah banaai he
 The Indian Business School in Hyderabad has been ranked 20th in the FT rankings of 2012
 isaki tulana main agar hair ajukeshan ke anya kshetron kii baat karen to ek iity ko chhodkar, shaayad hi kabhi koi bhartiya uniwarsity, global uniwarsities kii kisi bhi vishwasaneey ranking main top 200 main jagah bana pai he
 Of course, this number is not very high, yet it is a matter of fresh courage that there are few management institutes in India that can compete with the top institutes of the world
 to is maamle main pichad jane vaale institutes ko apana adarsh ghar ke hi in sansthaanon ko bananaa hoga jo bharat main maujuud tamaam baadhaon ke baavjood fal-phool rahe hai
 Surveys like Business Today b-schools ranking aim to increase competition in these institutions
 deshbhar ke institutes main ucch stareey maanak compitishan se hi sunishchit kiye ja sakate hai, kathor sarkari regulation se nahin
 a lot of India is at stake in this matter
 bharat tulanaatmak rup se apane nikatatam pratidwandvi china se kisi kshetra main aage nikal saktaa he to vah nolej iconomi he
 At present, China is only slightly higher than India in terms of quality of top management institutes
 2012 ke liye apat kii ranking main top 100 main china ke paanch management skulon ko jagah mili he jabaki bharat ke sirf do skool hi is maamle main khushkismat rahe hai
 However, in the 2012 ranking of QS, six institutions from both India and China have been ranked in the top 200 institutes
 bharat ko or behatar karne kii jarurat he
 Not only this, it also desperately needs to overtake China in terms of the quality of its skilled manpower
 kuch institute nae tareeke apana rahe hai
 Director of Management Development Institute Mukul P
 gupta kehete hai, ‘‘hamane industry kii maang or jaruraton ko dhyaan main rakhkar apana kariculam taiyaar kiya he
 Speaking on the change at the Institute of Management Technology (IMT), Director of the Joint Admissions Committee, Arun Mohan Sherry said, "the most unique thing for us is the two-year Global MBA
 anya bijness skulon main student exange program jahaan kam avadhi ke rahete hai, uske vipareet iamati ke course ke tahat student ko ek saal ke liye trade or industry ke bade thikaane-dubai padhai ke liye bheja jaataa he
 According to estimates, by 2020, emerging economies will contribute up to 50 per cent of the world's GDP
 isi prakaar global vruddhi dar main inkaa yogadan 66 fisadi se zyada kaa rahegaa
 China and India will have the largest share in the contribution of emerging economies
 america, europe or japan ke bazaaron ke thahar jane kii vajah se ab vishwa vyapaar ke liye yah aprihaary ho gaya he ki teji se badhati-ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon par dhyaan kendrit kiya jaae
 In the long term, it is estimated that by 2050, India and China will be the two largest economies in the world and perhaps by then India will be bigger than China
 agar yah baat sach hui, jo tabhi sambhav he jab bharat sarkaar koi roda na atkaaye, to bharat or china, global aarthik gatividhiyon ke centre ban jaaenge
 Indians and Chinese will have a major share of global business
 inke paas abhi hi duniya bhar ke kai pratishthit brands aa chuke hai jinamein jaguaar or lenovo jaise naam liye ja sakate hai
 Now the question is who will manage these businesses, Indian, Chinese, American or European people
 bharat ke paas vah sankhya bal he jisase vah 2050 tak duniya ke manageron kaa bada hissaa taiyaar kar sake
 But it does not have institutional capacity
 yah alag baat he ki agle dashak main isamen baari badlaav ho sakate hai
 Certainly some of the most talented Indians will manage several major global businesses
 ve ab bhi aisa hi kar rahe hai: doyache bank ke anshu jain or pepsy kii indra nuyi kuch hi aise hi udhaaharan hai
 The challenge is to create more such excellent personalities
 hamen agle 10 saal main aisa maahaul taiyaar hone kaa lakshya rakhana chahie ki kisi global diggaj company ke siio ke rup main kisi bhartiya kii niyukti koi khabar hi na bane
 Why? Because there will be many such people already
 tab jaakar hi bharat vastav main ek nolej iconomi ban paaegaa
 Now it is the responsibility of hundreds of business schools in the country to take the lead
 bank of polampur kitaab ke lekhak veda maathur hai
 It is published by Tintin Publications, Jaipur
 ek vyangyakaar ke liye charitron kaa chayan khaasaa chunauteepurn kaam hota he
 Anomalies should be underlined so that the satire should remain serious
 har daur main yah kaam mushkil rahaa he
 But in the era we are in, there are plenty of characters for the satirists
 thodaa-si rachanaatmakataa daal di jaae, to ek se ek shandaar charitra hamaare saamne khadey ho jate hai
 Many characters of Ved Mathur's recently published comic satire novel Bank of Polampur stand out in this way, as if they are right in the eye and saying - beware who told me imaginary, i am the truth
 main hi param satya hum
 This novel creates such narratives through many characters, in which the reasons for the sinking condition of our banking system and especially the public banks can be easily identified
 vyangy sachaai ke kitna kareeb ho saktaa he—iskaa pataa is upanyaas ke jariye lagata he
 There is a character in the novel - Dayaldas Gupta, there is something about it in the novel, Dayaldas ji was a man of humor and his style of work was amazing
 unke jivan kaa pehla siddhant tha—jeeyo or jeene do
 Where there is a chance to earn and if someone else is earning, then do not disturb his earnings
 jab tak aap dusron ke anand or aaraam main vyavdhaan nahin daalenge, koi anya aap ke maarg main baadha nahin daalega
 When we relate this characterization to certain trends in the banking system, some things are clearly visible
 bhartiya rigerv bank ke purv governor raghuram rajan dwaara taiyaar kiye note ke mutabik, kai bank tamaam tarah ke asurakshit karj dene ko bhi taiyaar hue
 In one round, the banks were also prepared that if the promoters, ie private businessmen put less amount in the project, the bank will get more money
 ek pramotor ne raghuram rajan ko bataaya ki banker khud aakar pramotor se bolte thekruye khaali checkbuk he, isamen jo rakam bharani he, baro, mil jaaegi
 Which bankers must have been in such banks, the answer to this question is found in characters like Dayaldas Gupta
 ek se badhkar charitra bank of polampur main hai
 There is a character in the novel — Bhuralal Bhurani, it is mentioned something like this
in the novel, Bhuralal Bhurani, a manager in a bank, was famous for bribery
 ek din juuton kii marammat karne vaala garib unke paas 5,000 rupye kaa rin lene aayaa
 Hearing the loan amount, Bhurani laughed and laughed very hard and said, "oh Nadan, you must have heard the saying, What will i take naked bath and what will i squeeze? What will i be able to give out of the loan of five thousand and survive?" What will you do with this? i give you a loan of fifty thousand,? 5,000 to be given to me
 ''garib maan gaya or bhurani ji ne pachaas hajaar rupye ke dastavej par hastakshar karvaa kar 45 hajaar rupye de die
 It is different that he could not handle the huge amount of poor 45 thousand rupees
 usne raashi kaa durupyog kar liya or rin nahin chukaa paaya
 This novel is full of such characters that it is astonishing to read that all the government banks filled with such truth-based characters are drowning, it is not surprising
 sawaal he ki ye ab tak chale kaise ja rahe the
 Sudha Natarajan is a character from Bank of Polampur
 jo varishthata hasil karne ke liye kisi bhi haalat main apana "kaarygrahan'' darshana chaahati thi
 On the day Madam's appointment to the "bank of Polampur" from Duryoga was made, she was on a tour of the north-east states and there was no ATM, even a branch of "bank of Polampur"
 carmik maamalon ke puraane visheshgy ganesh madhavan ne salaah di ki shilong main "korporate saamaajik daayitv'' (siesaar) ke antargat bank main sulabh shauchalay ke liye paisa diya tha
 If the new MD Sudha Natarajan visits, inspects or uses it, it will be treated as her bank joining and her seniority will begin
 apane record or suraksha ke liye unhone vahaan se paanch rupye kii raseed lekar sambhalakar rakh lee
 Such a receipt proves to be an important document when there is a dispute in the court regarding seniority
 aise majboot paatro ke aadhaar par khokhale hote bank of polampur kii neenv padi he
 Bank of Polampur sunk
 or polampur sirf upanyaas main nahin he
 The truth sometimes becomes more lethal and helical than imagined
 bank of polampur ke charitra lagaataar yahi bataate hai
 For many years to come, the characters of this novel will continue to reveal the truths of the banking world
 is kitaab ke kai charitra saamne aakar khadey ho jate hai maano aankh main aankh daalkar kah rahe hon—khabardaar jo mujhe kaalpanik kaha to

 Even though Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was a judge on Kapil Sharma show, is missing from the show due to his controversial statement and election
 lekin unka zikr sho ke har episod main jarur hota he
 On Saturday, when Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif reached the Kapil Sharma Show, Comedy King told that Katrina has sent a special letter for you by Sidhu Sahab

 These days this institute is in the discussion about the election of its new director
 FTII ke chairman pad kii niyukti par hue vivaad or aane vaale samay main sanchaar ke badalte va mahatvapurn hote role ko dekhte hue is pad par kisi aise vyakti ko baithaae jane kii ummid kii ja rahi he jo har lihaaj se sanchaar kii bhoomika ko samajhataa ho
 However, this election is also important because during the tenure of this director, this institute is likely to be converted into a communication university
 in tamaam pahaluon ke maddenjar is santhaan kaa diarector kis aadhaar par tay kiya jaae,isi par hamase vistaar main baat kii indraprastha uniwarsity ke uniwarsity skool of maas communication ke professor si pi singh ne
 - New Director to be appointed soon in the premier media institute of the country
 aap is pad par asin hone vaale shaks main kya khubiyaan dekhnaa chahenge?aksar aise sansthaanon main diarector bahut dur kii soch nahin pate or bas apana kaarykaal nipta kar chal dete hai
 But looking at the current era, we need a director with many qualities in the Indian Institute of Mass Communication
 vah media industry, academix or prashasan teenon se khud hi tapakar niklaa ho or urjavan hone ke saath-saath desh duniya main kahaan kya ghatit ho rahaa he, is par paini najar rakhata ho tabhi vah desh ke liye rashtriya or antarrashtriya str ke communication profeshnal banane main sakasham sanstha khadi kar paaegaa
 Only administration and academics or industry will hardly prove to be useful for future needs
 ab tak kaa anubhav yahi bataata he
 In the coming time, IIMC is under consideration to be made a Communication University and it may happen during the tenure of this director
 aise main diarector se apekshaayen or bhi rahengi
 
 
 absolutely
 kuch or kehane se pehle main china kaa udhaaharan dena chaahunga
 The communication university that China has created is the world's best
 iskaa model china ne apni jaruraton ko dekhte hue taiyaar kiya he, jisamen students ko is tarah bhi taiyaar kiya jayega ki ve aage kis tarah china ke chhavi nirmaan main yogadan de sakate hai
 The new communication university that will be built here will be different from the common university
 or diarector kii kshamtaaon kaa paimaana bhi inhen chunautiyon ke aadhaar par kiya janaa chahie
 Mass communication is currently taught in more than 50 universities in India
 IIMC main hi 80 vikasshil deshon ke chaatr training ke liye aate hai
 In such a situation, the thinking is that the purpose of the new university will be to create a quick job-ready recruit or to give information after 10 to 15 years, given the need of industry and society and new references of India! Obviously, we do not need today, in the future, experts handling the situation will have to be removed from this university
 - aapaki baat ko ham yun samajhen ki ham stretiji ko lekar kamjor hai
 
 
 Of course
 stretiji ko lekar ham zyada badi soch vaale nahin he
 The objective of the institute is not just to create some job-seeking journalists but also to create professionals who do not restrict themselves to meet the current needs of society and media industry and for whom communication does not mean just journalism
 bharat ke log, bharat ke logon se kis tarah baat karen ki kal ko ham behatar naagarik paidaa kar saken
 
 
 We have to lay the foundation of this university in view of all the diversities of the country
 kis baat se desh kii chhavi banegi, kisase bigadegi, international str par kaise desh kaa majboot paksh rakhaa jaae, ye sab isi stretiji kaa hissaa hai
 See the example of Emperor Ashoka
 unhone us samay uplabdh har tareeke se apana shanti sandesh aise failaayaa kisbhi bhul gaye ki kaling ke yuddh main hajaaron logon kii jaan gai thi jiske baad samraat ne ahimsa kaa rasta chunaa tha
 Look at America - whatever the journalists did after the second world war, but never let the image of the country deteriorate
 iraq par hamalaa kiya gaya, is tark par ki vahaan vishwa shanti ko khatra banate khatarnaak hathiyaar hai
 But nothing happened
 phir bhi america kii kirakiri nahin hui
 This is the wonder of communication strategy, in which we are behind and the experts are our needs
 - is aadhaar par nae diarector se aap or kya apekshaayen rakhte hai?choti chizon se upar uthakar hamen yah samajhnaa hoga ki mahaj skill or nolej se bhi kaam nahin banegaa
 That's why i say that the new director should have visionary and research vision along with experience of industry and academy fields
 bas naam kaa ek or diarector vakt kii jarurat nahin he
 He should be a visionary, know research and also have deep experience of the country and the world
 yani is post ke liye hamen paanch baraabar shikhar vaala ek pahaad chahie, jo system kaa shikaar na bane
 At the same time, do not make students a journalism machine, but instead of this, understand the power of communication and work to improve the image of the country with foresight! Let the new director be the one who not only shows big dreams but also has the passion to fulfill it
 vah tathy va satya ko saamne laane vaale visheshgy hamen de
 In the last 50 years, journalists from 80 countries have left here
 inke saath conection baithaana kaam aa saktaa he
 - What is your opinion about the course structure? According to me, IIMC should have courses at three levels - first skill level, second in-service related and third high level strategic research
 pehla str prafational course karaane ko, duusare main jo log communication line main kaam kar rahe hai unako or training di jaae or tisare main neshnal va international str kii research karai jaae
 In the current phase, work is going on at the first level here only
 vahiin teachers ko bhi industry kii jarurat puri karne kii soch se aage badhanaa hoga
 They have to connect their dream with the country
 yuvaaon ke saath chalane par hamen khud hi samaj aa jayega ki hamen kisi communication stretiji kii jarurat he
 Here i expect the director to be energetic as well as a dreamer
 sapane dekhnaa hi aage badhane kaa maarg prashast karata he
 Dreams become very dangerous, so the new director shows dangerous dreams in a dangerous way and has the courage to fulfill them
 - pichley dinon diarector kii umr kaa mudda bhi uthaa
 It has been reduced from 65 to 60 years
 aap kya kahenge?mere hisaab se to yah sahi he
 IIMC will convert to a new university
 ise aise diarector kii jarurat ho jo seekhney vaala ho, apni chalaane vaala na ho, falexbil ho, chunauti lene vaala ho, samjhauta nahin kare, usamen anubhav ke saath jijeevishaa ho, kuch kar guzarane kaa jajba ho, vah pishan ho jo santhaan ke saath desh kii chhavi ko badaye
 However, this age limit has been set at 55 years abroad

 He has instructed all units of the RSS to do some kind of social work because "this is the only way to reach the under privileged section of the society
" ''philhal, aresas se sambhddha lagbhag 750 enjio vibhinn naamon se kaam kar rahe hai
 Bhagwat plans to bring these non-governmental organizations under a top organization called Rashtriya Seva Bharati
 saamaajik kaary ko aresas ke andruni halake main seva kaary ke rup main janaa jaataa he or is 87 varshiya sanghathan ke itihaas main is par abhootpurv jor diya gaya he
 The association runs hostels, residential schools and health centers as part of its social work
 ye pariyojnaayen mukhya rup se prayek rajya ke doordaraj ke kshetron main chalaai jaati hai
 The Sangh has formed a separate branch to oversee these projects
 yojana banane kii ranneeti main shaamil aresas ke ek ucch padaadhikari ne india today ko bataaya ki bhagwat ne sanghathan kaa najariya badalane ke liye li se hatakar kaam karne kaa faisla kiya he
 According to that officer, the people involved in the scheme are trying to attract the youth who do not want to be cut off from their roots and are willing to bring change
 ''jo yuva abhi-abhi matadaata bane hai, unka sarokaar na to ram janmabhumi andolan se he or na hi ve pradhanmantri ke rup main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke kaarykaal ko yaad karte hai
 They want economic reform, but not at the cost of the environment

 Our hopes rest on these youth
 ''bhagwat desh ke naksal prabhavit ilaakon tak saamaajik kaary sambandhit pariyojnaon kaa vistaar karnaa chaahate hai

 un ilaakon main aresas kii ek ikai jaldi hi kaam shuru kar sakati he
 "the Sangh's prominent campaigner Manmohan Vaidya admits that the organization's focus on social work is greater than before

 "in these areas, about 1,31,578 projects are going on in 93,421 places
 ''bhagwat sangh kii pahchaan ko bachaae rakhane ke liye saamaajik kaam par jor de rahe hai
 Though the Sangh says that it has units at 55,000 places across the country and its members are growing rapidly in the south, the number of visitors to its branches has been steadily shrinking
 ek andruni sutara ne kaha, ''aresas main aajkal keval saamaajik pariyojnaon kii sankhya bad rahi he, baaki chizon kaa graph neeche ja rahaa he
 "the branch is important," he said at a meeting of officials held in Mumbai in January, but social activities are equally important

 com / pxaofdq4za haryana police deraa sachcha sauda kaa tilism todane kii koshish main din raat lagi hui he
 But the vicious people of the core team of the camp manage to mislead the police
 phir chaahe wo haniprit ho yaa phir vipashyana
 According to sources, the police is preparing to arrest Vipassana
 jiske baad ram rahim or dere se jude kai ahm raaj baahar aa sakate hai
 Dera Sacha Sauda Ki chairpersonvipassana insaki difficulties are increasing
 uske sir par ek taraf giraftaar kii talwaar latak rahi he to duusari ore use deraa gang se jaan kaa khatra bana hua he
 Vipassana, the chairperson of the disputed Dera Sacha Sauda, now looks badly trapped
 jiske ek ore kuna hai to duusari ore khai
 If sources are to be believed, the police may arrest Vipassana soon
 us par police ko gumraah karne or suchanaaen chhipaane kaa aarope he
 The SIT team has found out in the investigation that Vipassana was also present in the team which was planning to incite violence in Panchkula
 police ne haniprit or aditya insa samet jin 20 se zyada logon ke mobile phone kii lokation sirsa me tres kii thi
 Vipassana's mobile phone was also included in it
 haalanki police ne sabhi 20 logon kii kol ditels kaa khulaasa nahin kiya he
 But the location of the mobile phones of Honeypreet, Aditya and Vipassana has been revealed
 yahi baat vipashyana ke liye badi musiibat sabit ho sakati he
 Honeypreet had called a meeting in Sirsa on August 17, before the judgment in the rape case on August 25
 isamen deraa gang se jude sabhi bade chehre shaamil the
 According to police sources, the blueprint for the Panchkula violence was prepared in this meeting
 isi meeting main faisla liya gaya tha ki agar faisla paksh main aayaa to ram rahim satsang karegaa or agar faisla ram rahim ke khilaaf gaya to panchkula main hinsa failaai jaaegi
 For this, a list of special people of Dera Gang was prepared
 jisamen panchakula main kai jagahon par deraa premiyon kii sankhya badhaane, niyantrit karne or danga bhadakaane kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya tha
 For this work, Honeypreet and Aditya Reiki Panchkula a week ago
 aise main ab vipashyana ke saamne do raste hai
 But both are not easy
 panchkula hinsa se jude ahm saboot haath na lagane kii vajah se ab police vipashyana insa ko sarkari gavaah bananaa chaahati he
 Vipassana can get rid of the threat of arrest by becoming a government witness but by doing so she can come directly to the target of the dreaded gang of the camp
 vipashyana ke saamne ab ek taraf kuan he or duusari taraf khai
 She neither wants to be arrested nor does she want to oppose the dera by becoming a government witness
 pataa chalaa he ki deraa gang ne vipashyana kii giraftaar ke aage kii ranneeti bhi taiyaar kar rakhi he
 There has been a secret meeting in Sirsa regarding his arrest
 jisamen faisla liya gaya he ki agar vipashyana insa giraftaar hoti he to turant nai deraa team kaman sambhaal legi
 By the way, Vipassana is also considered vicious like Honeypreet
 yahi vajah he ki tamaam poochtacha ke baavjood police usase kuch khaas nahin ugalva saki he
 While many episodes of the sins of Baba and Honeypreet stop on Vipassana
 sutron ke mutabik to vipashyana ko deraa kii sampatti or khajaane kii puri jaankaree he
 Investigation has revealed that on the instructions of Honeypreet Insa, she used to sign the check of Dera
 use 17 agast kii vivaadit baithak ke bare main puri jaankaree thi lekin 13 oktober ko jab vah panchakula police ke saamne pesh hui thi to usne baithak ke bare main golmol jawaab diya tha
 Not only this, if the sources are to be believed, on August 25, Vipassana Insa had helped to reach the Hihanipreet Insaco Dera
 usne hi haniprit ko rohtak se sirsa ke liye bhejne ke liye ek gaadi kaa prabandh kiya tha
 According to police sources, Vipassana Insa knew that Honeypreet Insa had opened the biometric locks of Dera and had lost cash, land papers and documents related to banks from there
 vipashyana ko ab tak kul 5 baar panchkula or sirsa esaiti ke saamne pesh hone ke liye samman jari kiye gaye the lekin vah sirf do baar hi police ke saamne pesh ho pai he
 He had pleaded with the police thrice as an excuse for illness
 police ko shaq he ki vipashyana ne poochtacha se bachane ke liye teen baar jhuthe medical certificate pesh kiye kyonki yah saare certificate sirsa ke deraa aspataal se jari kiye gaye the
 The police will now get these medical certificates examined as well
 police ko kai baar chaka chuki vipashyana ko sirsa le jaakar poochtacha karne kii taiyaari he
 He will soon be summoned and called before the SIT for questioning
 vipashyana insa se deraa ke gunahon ke saboot mitaae jane or panchakula hinsa ke bare main poochtacha kii jaaegi or agar usne phir golmaal kiya to police use giraftaar kar sakati he

 Brother, i am thankful to these people - if they had not been there, they would not have been Modi

 Has this happened before? No, i saw that the demand of India has increased in foreign countries these days - even if the question has been before independence - after that no one has seen it
 bolo kisi ne dekhi he kya? nahin naa
 You saw Barak write an article in Time magazine about your Prime Minister
 kya aisa pehle kabhi hua he? nahin naa
 This is happening for the first time

 Will you be able to count? No no sushamaa hongi bihar chunaav prabhareeb baat sushamaa ji kii
 Sushma Swaraj is our foreign minister - you must know
 sushamaa ji ke kaam par agar aap gaur karenge to paaenge ki aaj tak kisi videsh mantri ne vaisaa parform nahin kiya jaisaa sushamaa ji kar rahi hai
 Rather i would say that Sushma ji herself has not done so much work till today

 isi tarah 2017 main france or germany main aam chunaav honge - or ye wo vakt hoga jab uttar pradesh vidhaan sabha chunaav ke liye vot daale jaaenge
 As an experiment, we have currently decided to contest in three countries, which we are going to start with Canada
 giriraaj ko canada kii kamanamitron, ye media sirf general sahab ke hi peeche nahin padaa tha,giriraaj bhaaine hansi-majaak main kuch kah diya to use bhi in logon ne mudda bana diya
 As a result of which the TRP of the media has increased, Giriraj Bhai became famous all over the world
 mujhase to kai logon ne unke bare main canada main bhi poocha
 i said don't worry, i will send Giriraj Bhai to Canada as soon as i return
 aapako bataa den mitron, giriraaj bhai ko hamane canada main chunaav abhiyaan samiti kaa adhyaksh banaaya he
 He has had a lot of experience in Bihar elections and we will get full benefit from it
 ek baat or
 i met Gitanjali in Toronto
 maine unhen bataaya ki unke papa bahut badhiya kaam kar rahe hai
 Gitanjali is the daughter of our ministerial colleague Chaudhary Birendra Singh
 haryana chunaavon main bhi unhone bahut acha kaam kiya tha
 Now we have also decided to send him to Canada with Giriraj bhai as his associate
 birendra ji or gitanjali kuch din saath rahenge to unhen acha bhi lagegaa or isse hamaare 'beti bachaao, beti padhaao' abhiyaan ko bhi majbootee milegi
 Friends, since there is still a long time in the elections in Germany and France, no decision has been taken on that
 jaise hi is bare main faisla liya jayega - ham aapako bataa denge
 At the moment, friends would like permission

 iske baad usne shaadi se saaf inkaar kar diya
 After seeing the photo, Mukesh Sah, the bride's brother, started to understand that someone had been cheated
 khaas baat yah thi is shaadi ke madhyasth duulhe kaa chachera bhai vikaas saah tha
 The comments duulhe ne bataaya ki uskaa bhai suresh raay or vikaas saah patna main kisi mithai kii dukaan main kaam karte hai or vah chennai main naukari karata he
