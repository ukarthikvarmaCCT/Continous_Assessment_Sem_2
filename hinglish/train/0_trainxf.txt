 What has Saifuddin Soz said? Saifuddin Soz has backed the statement of former President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, in which he said that if Kashmiris get a chance, he would like to be free rather than go with anyone
 soz kaa kahana he ki musharraf kaa ek dashak pehle diya gaya ye bayaan aaj bhi kai myanon main thik baithta he
 However, he also said that getting this freedom is not possible
 mere bayanon kaa party se lenaa-dena nahin he

 ajtak ke saath baatcheet main unhone baar-baar is baat par jor diya ki kashmir main agar shanti sthapit kerani he to har kisi se baat kerani hogi
 He also supported talking to separatist leaders
 haalanki, unhone kaha ki is bayaan kaa unki party congress se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Saifuddin Soz said that Kashmiri people do not want to come with Hindustan or with Pakistan, they all want independence
 lekin ye aazaadee naammumkin he
 In the Omkareshwar dam on the Narmada in Madhya Pradesh's Khandwa district, water filled up to 193 meters this year is expected to submerge the village Jiroth, which is located on an island made of water of the tributaries Cauvery and Ajnar
 vartmaan main isamen 113 adivasee parivaar rahete hai, jiroth ke teen taraf pani he tathaa ek ore pahari he

 When the people of Jiroth went to the Madhya Pradesh High Court to seek their rights from the government, the court understood the pain of these families and gave relief to them saying that it is unfair to crush the constitutional rights of the tribals

 Janata Dal United's Legislative Councilors want a government holiday on Guru Purnima
 lekin ye maang karnaa bihar vidhaan parishad main unhen mahangaa pad gaya, kyonki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar)ko yah baat raas nahin aayi
 On the contrary, he instructed the legislators to work more than 2 hours that day
 darasal, janata dal united ke do vidhaan parshad sanjeev kumaar singh or ranvir nandan ne guru poornima par sarkari avkaash kii maang kii
 Ranveer Nandan went two steps ahead and started reading the significance of Guru Poornima in the House and the verses in Sanskrit
 is bich sadan kii karrwai ko apane kaksh se tivi par dekh rahe mukhyamantri nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar)ko yah maang puri atpati lagi
 After that he immediately came to the House and as soon as he came, he said that i am very surprised by this demand
 kya aap har din jo puja karte hai, us din chuttee chaahate hai? phir unhone kaha ki abhi kya chal rahaa he, abhi gupt navaratri chal rahaa he
 So why not say that the entire holiday should be given even on the Gupta Navratri
 phir unhone kaha ki guru poornima ke din to sadan kii karrwai do ghante or badhaai jaani chahie
 After this, Nitish Kumar said, what do you want if the Guru is worshiped, then leave is celebrated
 puja to aap kabhi bhi kar sakate hai
 What do you want that all the festivals you celebrate will be a holiday
 saarvajanik avkaash ho jaae
 Your gurus have taught you to sit at home all day and do no work
 balki unhone to aap sabko or kaam karne ke liye prerit kiya he
 Therefore, i am very surprised by this demand of you guys

 aisa hi kuch dekha gaya dilli vidhansabha ke mangalvaar se shuru hue do divasiy satr ke dauraan
 The residents of Delhi may be facing the bitter cold of January these days, but the monsoon session of the last year is still going on in the Delhi Assembly
 mangalvaar ko jab dilli vidhansabha kaa do dinon kaa satr bulaayaa gaya to kam hi logon ko maaloom hoga ki nae saal yani 2017 main bhi pichley saal ke monsoon satr ke tahat hi sadan kii kaarywahi chal rahi he
 It usually happens that the winter session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly is called in November or December, but the Delhi government has not considered it necessary to prune the monsoon session for some reason
 yani 9 june 2016 ko jo dillividhansabhaka monsoon satr shuru hua use sarkaar ne khatm hi nahin kiya
 The assembly session of 17 and 18 January is the sixth part of the monsoon session 2016
 sarkaar ne aisa kyon kiya iske peeche tamaam siyaasi kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 In fact, Delhi Legislative Assembly has just 3 opposition mlas, out of which BJP MLA Om Prakas Sharma was suspended for two sessions in the middle of the monsoon session i
e
 11 June 2016
 agar dilli main sheetakaaleen satr bula liya jaataa to uske baad opi sharma kii sadsyta behaal ho jaati, jo aam aadmi party sadan ke bheetar unke aakraamak tevar ko dekhte hue nahin chaahati he
 In addition, whenever a session of the Legislative Assembly begins in a new year, it begins with the address of the Lieutenant Governor, who is the representative of the President
 lekin pichley saal ke satr ko jari rakhkar aam aadmi party sarkaar ne ye tarika bhi dhundh nikaala jisase dilli ke nae uparajyapal anil baijal kaa vidhansabha main abhibhaashan hi nahin karana pade
 When the Assembly met on Tuesday, an objection was also lodged by the opposition
 agar uparajyapal kaa abhibhaashan hota to aisi haalat main saamaanya taur par mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko bhi sadan ke netaa kii haisiyat se vidhansabha main maujuud hona jaruri hota, lekin mukhyamantri is vakt punjab chunaav main party ke liye prachaar main lage hai, isliye unki maujuudagi bhi mushkil thi
 In such a situation, the first session of 2017 in the Delhi Legislative Assembly will be the budget session, which will probably be in March
 tabatak punjab or goa main chunaav bhi nibat jaaenge or emsidi chunaav bhi kareeb hoga
 In such a situation, the Aam Aadmi Party government will also be able to tell a lot of its achievements through the address of the Governor
 saath hi bajet satr se opi sharma bhi baahar honge yanividhansabhaamein bijepi ke vidhayakon kii sankhya bhi do hi rahegi
 The ruling party will not have to face much uproar
 kab or kaise rahe june se janvari tak ke satr ke 6 hisse1-pehla bhaag- 9 june se 13 june- aam muddon par charchaa or prashnkaal2-doosraa bhaag- 22 agast se 26 agast- hoicourt ke sarkaar or uparajyapal ke adhikaron ko lekar aae faisle ke baad bulaayaa gaya
 Dengue and chikungunya were discussed in Delhi

 Earlier we used to only hear about terror, but now we see that terror live with our own eyes
 darasal baat chaahe aadhunik hathiyaaron kii ho yaa phir takanic kii, khatarnaak baat ye he ki aatankwaadi bhi ab in donon kaa bharpoor istemaal kar rahe hai
 The incident is from this month
 aatankwaadiyon ko ek police hadquarter ko udaana tha or saath hi us dhamaake ko unhen camere main bhi kaid karnaa he
 So those drones fit the camera first and then the explosion
 ruunh kampa dene vaala videojisne bhi is dhamaake kii tasviren dekhi, wo hill gaya
 Terrorists have carried out suicide attacks a lot, shed blood of innocents too, but shoot such a video of one of their attacks and put it on their website and that too for a terrorist organization like Taliban, this is completely new and shocking
 jameen se jameen par kiya gaya hamalifghanistan ke nava jile main police mukhyalay par kiye gaye is hamale kii in tasveeron ko pehali najar main dekh kar har kisi ne ise drone atake kaa video samajha
 But the reality was different
 sachai ye he ki ye aatmghaatee hamalaa jameen se jameen par hi kiya gaya
 While his pictures were taken by drone and that too in a very professional manner
 taiyaari se lekar hamale tak kaa videois video main hamale kii taiyaari se lekar dhamaake tak ko record kiya gaya he
 In the beginning of the video, a suicide bomber appears with his Humvee vehicle
 ye afghanistan ke usee helmond provins kaa ek gumnaam thikaana he, jis ilaake main is vaardaat ko anjaam diya gaya
 The attacker sits in this armored vehicle loaded with ammo 
 wo apane saathiyon ko alavida kahkar ravaanaa ho jaataa he
 The next picture is a bird's eye view of Helmand's police headquarters from a distance
 thodi hi der main in tasveeron main wo hamvi gaadi bhi najar aati he, jise taliban kaa aatmghaatee hamalavar lekar ravaanaa hua tha
 The vehicle travels through the winding paths directly to the police headquarters and after that with a loud bang the entire police headquarters is turned into a fireball
 yani aatmghaatee hamalavar apni hamvi gaadi ko datonet kar use udaane main kaamyaab ho chukaa he
 Before the investigation was completed, Talibane claimed the attack was so loud that the blast sound is not only clearly recorded in the drone camera mic of hundreds of feet high but also the vibrations produced by the explosion can be felt clearly
 Can
 iske saath hi police headquarter se dhul or dhuen kaa jabardast gubaar uthta he, jo dekhte hi dekhtaa helmond ke aasmaan par chaa jaataa he or puri vaardaat ko kaid kar rahaa drone camera bhi uski chapet main aa jaataa he
 The Taliban carried out this suicide attack in this police headquarters of Helmand Province on the 3rd of this month, but before the investigation of the case reached any end, by releasing these pictures of this attack, it shocked the world
 mosul se bhi jald ho jayega iesas kaa khaatmiraq ke mosul shahar main iesas or iraqi fouj ke darmyaan aakhri ghamaasan jari he
 The last is because almost all of Iraq and Syria have isis's feet uprooted, but Mosul is the only place where IS is still taking hiccups
 lekin mitra desh, iraqi fouj or kurdish fiteron kii maane to ab ye hichakiyaan bhi chand dinon main band ho jaaengi
 The last war and will be completely crushed, the Iraqi army, Allied and Kurdish fighters have succeeded in breaking the ISIS pawn, that is, the last fortress of ISIS
 na sirf kamyaabi hasil kar lee he balki iesas ke beraham jallaadon ko unki aukaat bhi bataane lage hai
 In the entire region of Iraq and Syria, ISIS has now uprooted in most places
 or ab ye mosul hi iklauti jagah bachi he, jahaan in aatankwaadiyon ke saath fouj kii aakhri ladaai chal rahi he
 The military situation that is wreaking havoc on terrorists is that friendly countries, led by America, are wreaking havoc on ISIS here
 mahaj ek hafte main is ilaake main aatankwaadiyon par 32 hawaii hamale hue hai
 1700 new weapons have been handed over to the militants fighting the militants, who have destroyed 136 ISIS bunkers while the militants have destroyed 18 tunnels and 26 car bombs
 iesas se jang main pis lage aam logahalanki iraqi sarkaar or kurdish ladaakon ne ab tak is jang main maranevaalon kaa koi sahi-sahi aankada jari nahin kiya he lekin mitra desh jis tarah se yahaan aatankwaadiyon par hawaii hamale kar rahe hai, use dekh kar andaja lagaaya ja rahaa he ki iesas kaa 'di and' ab bilkul kareeb aa chukaa he
 Although the army has liberated many small towns and villages from ISIS occupation, but in these circumstances, the worst condition is that of women and children living in this area, who are now being overwhelmed every single moment
 
 hajaaron begunaah log is asamanjas main hai ki ab wo apana ghar chhod kar jaaen yaa phir iesas ke safaaye ke baad itmeenaan se nai jindagi kii shuruyaat karen
 While on the streets of Mosul, thousands of homeless people are still waiting to return to their homes, which are badly beset by sickness and hunger and are waiting for time to change
 bagdadi kii talash main faujahaalanki philhal iesas se lard rahi tamaam fujen is duniya ke sabase bade jallaad yani abu bakar al bagdadi kii talash main he
 Baghdadi is last seen in this city
 aise main kehane kii jarurat nahin he ki jaise hi bagdadi in in phujon ke hathe chadhataa he yaa phir iraqi fouj, mitra desh yaa phir kurdish fiteron use nishaanaa banaate hai, iesas kaa game over hona tay he
 Town Bertella is present at a distance of a few kilometers from the city of Mosul, where the innocent people were killed for not changing religion
 isaaiyon ke is chote se shahar main iesas ne saikadon logon ko sirf isliye chun-chun kar maut ke ghat utaar diya tha kyonki wo apana dharm badalane ko taiyaar nahin the
 But now this excess of terrorists has become a thing of the past
 bartela se iraqi fouj ne aatankwaadiyon ko khaded diya he or aise main khandhar ban chuke is shahar ke carch kaa ghanta ek baar phir se ghanaghna uthaa
 Once again the bells echoed in the church, in the house of the above, where two years ago, there was a series of words and prayers
 ab usee ghar main pojishan liye faujee combing oparation kar rahe hai or is halaat ke liye bhi koi or nahin, balki vahi iesas jimmedaar he, jisane iraq or syria kii ek badi aabaadi ke liye jeena dushwaar kar diya he
 It is another matter that this is the last picture of the war of the Iraqi army, Allied and Kurdish fighters against the terrorists, after which this church of Bertella near Mosul was completely liberated and after two years the church bells Ghanaghana once again arose for prayers
 mosul se 14 kilometre dur iraq ke is isaai bahul kasbe par agast 2014 se hi iesas ke aatankwaadiyon kaa kabja tha, jinhone yahaan rahane vaale tamaam isaaiyon ke saamne bas do hi vikalp chode the
 The first is to convert to Islam by obeying ISIS and secondly to be killed without refusing to change religion
 jaahir he bartela main jahaan iesas kii manamaani kaa shikaar hokar bahut se log maare gaye, vahiin bahut se log aise bhi the, jinhone majaburi main jinda rahane ke liye apana dharm badal liya
 But as soon as the Baji Palti and Iraqi forces drove ISIS militants out of this city, the whole church as well as the church, thundered
 puure do saal baad is carch kii ghantiyaan baji or log ek baar phir prarthana ke liye yahaan ikattha hue
 However, as soon as the pictures inside the church became common in this last operation of the army, the people became sour
 aatankwaadiyon ne carch ko buree tarah barbaad kar diya tha
 Evidences of hatred were spread everywhere inside the church
 lekin ganimat ye he ki ab ye sab kuch gujarey vakt kii baat he or iraq ke duusare shaharon kii tarah hi bartela bhi raahat kii saans le rahaa he
 According to sources, in this face-to-face battle, 80 terrorists were put to death only in Bertella, whereas, just like Bertella, the army has got another Christian town Hamdania now liberated from the terrorists
 iraq ke baad syria tak failaae the pariraq ke ek chote se hisse main pehali baar aies ne sar uthaaya tha
 Then it spread to a large part of Iraq
 uske baad isane iraq kii seemaa langhi or padosi mulk syria tak ja pahunchaa
 Let me tell you why and how IS was born in Iraq? Who was the cause and who is responsible for it? ISIS was born after a long war, the US had liberated Iraq from the clutches of Saddam Hussein
 par is aazaadee ko hasil karne ke dauraan iraq puri tarah barbaad ho chukaa tha or usee barbaad iraq se 2011 tak america apni sari sena ko waapas bula letaa he
 Baghdadi Started Roots Many small groups now start fighting for their strength as American forces leave Iraq
 unheen main se ek gut kaa netaa tha abu bakar al bagdadi
 al-qaeda Chief of Iraq
 wo 2006 se hi iraq main apni jameen taiyaar karne main laga tha
 But then he had no money, no help nor fighters
 jaisaa ki uske naam se pataa chalata he, bagdadi chunki khud sthaneey tha, lihaaja videshiyon ke iraq chhodte hi usne iraq main apni jaden nae sire se jamaane kaa faisla kiya
 In fact, by the time the US Army returned from Iraq in 2011, it had ruined the Iraqi government
 saddaam maaraa ja chukaa tha
 Infrastructure was completely devastated and the biggest thing was that he left the power walkroom in Iraq
 magar sansadhano kii kami ke chalate tab bagaddi zyada kaamyaab nahin ho paa rahaa tha
 However, to re-occupy Iraq, by then it had renamed al-qaeda Iraq as the new ISI
 yani islamic state of iraq
 Baghdadi had united the commanders and soldiers of Saddam Hussein's army
 iske baad usne shuruuaati nishaanaa police, military daftar, checkpaints or recrureating steshans ko bananaa shuru kiya
 By now several thousand people had joined with Baghdadi
 par phir bhi bagdadi ko iraq main wo kamyaabi nahin mil rahi thi
 Desperate from Iraq, Baghdadi now decided to turn to Syria
 syria tab grih yuddh jhel rahaa tha
 al-qaeda and the Free Syrian Army were the two largest factions taking a front from the Syrian President
 par pehle chaar saal tak syria main bhi bagdadi ko koi badi kambabi nahin mili
 However, during this period, he had changed the name of his organization once again to ISIS
 islamic state of iraq and syria
 The General of the Free Syrian Army first appeared in front of the world and appealed to the world that if they do not get weapons, they will lose their war with the rebels within a month
 isi apil ke hafte bhar ke andar hi america, israel, jordan, turki, saudi arab or katar ne free sirian army ko hathizaar, paise, or training kii madad deni shuru kar di
 These countries have all brought modern weapons, anti-tank missiles, ammunition to Syria
 or bas yaheen se iesas ke din palat gaye
 Actually, the weapons which were for the Free Syrian Army, they reached ISIS within a year
 kyonki tab tak aies free sirian army main send laga chukaa tha or uske bahut se log uske saath ho liye the
 Also, IS deceived the world by wearing the mask of Freedom Fighter in Syria
 isi nakaab kii aadaa main khud america tak ne anjaane main aies ke aatankwaadiyon ko trening de daali
 The stock of weapons had now accumulated
 15 hajaar ke kareeb ladaake bhi saath ho liye the
 After this, in June 2014, for the first time such a picture of IS suddenly appears in front of the world and on seeing this, an anonymous organization becomes the most dangerous terrorist organization in the world in the next few months

 The name of a very talented playback singer like Manna Dey (original name: Prabodh Chandra Dey) has been a pioneer in bringing classical dignity to Hindi film-music variety
 jab hindi cinema ke sawak filmon ke daur main parshvagayan kaa kaam apni sabase sarthak sthiti main ke
 L
 sahagal, johrabai ambalawali, amirbai karnatakai, rajkumaari, suraiya, parul ghosh, shamashaad begum or mukesh jaisi awaajon keemarfat sadabahaar pahchaan bana chukaa tha
 Then began a new time in the serious and classical ragdari of Manna Dey, nephew of Bengal's legendary singer Krishna Chandra Dey, whose first successful expression was under the musical direction of Sachin Dev Burman through Gagan Vishal (mashal, 1950) Emerged on the scene, after which Manna Dey became established as synonymous with serious, emotional and classical singing
 yah manna de kii kamaal kii gayikee kaa hi asar mana jaataa he ki mashhoor parshvagayak mohammad rafee ne ek baar yah prachlit bayaan unke sammaan main diya tha: ''aap sabhi mere gaanon ko sunate hai, jabaki main sirf manna de ko sunata hum
 Manna Dey was born on 1 May 1919 in Kolkata as a child of Purnachandra Dey and Mahamaya Dey
 unhone apni aarambhik shiksha vahiin rahakar scottish carch skool evam vidyasagar college se puri kii
 While working as an assistant to his uncle Krishna Chandra Dey, he s
 di
 Also served as an assistant to Burman
 unke parshvagayan kii yatra 1942 se tamanna film ke madhyam se aakaar leti he, jisamen unhone ek geet jaago ai ushaa, panchi bole jaago gaaya tha
 He also comes to us as the most unique singer in the sense that he has sung extensively in Hindi and Bangla films, besides films for Punjabi, Bhojpuri, Magadhi, Maithili, Assamese, Oriya, Gujarati, Marathi and Konkani languages
 Has also played playback
 yah manna de ke sammaan ke khate main hi darj he ki unhone kiraanaa gharaane ke mashhoor gayak pandit bhimsen joshi ke saath shankar-jaykishan ke nirdesan main ek adbhut jugalbandi ketki gulab juhi chanpak ban foole (basant bahaar) gaakar jaise yah sabit kiya ki unki shastreeyta kii jaankaree kahin se bhi is apratim gayak se unniis nahin he
 This notion is also confirmed by some of his most popular solo songs
 aap yaad karen to aasaani se dheron geeton kii aisi samrudh thati se do-chaar honge, jahaan gayikee kii gultaraashi, raag va taalon kii apurv pratishtha or sangeetkaar kii dhun par laajawab pakad, sabhi aapas main ek hokar abhibhoot karne vaali sanrachana gadhate hai
 Songs like Laga Chunari mein daag hoon hoon (dil hi hai hai), Ask me how i spent the rain The tapestry was an absolutely unique taste in the world of music
 shastreey sangeet se alag, prem kaa rumaan rachane main athwa hasya kii phuljhadi bikherne ke liye yaa dukh kii vyanjana main dard kaa peedajanya izhaar karne main bhi manna de kii gayikee bejod rahi he
 He was perhaps the only singer from whom every composer composed songs for his film for certain specific expressions and sentiments
 udhaaharan ke taur par, i mere pyaare vatan (kabuliwala), i meri johra jabeen (vakt), kasme vaade pyaar vafa (upkaar), hansane kii chaah ne itnaa mujhe rulaayaa he (avishkaar), jindagi kisi he paheli hai (anand), yaari he imaan meraa (zanjeer) jaise kai amar geeton ko yaad kiya ja saktaa he
 a major feature of them was that their pairing was successful at the same level with almost all the singers
 phir vah saathi gayakon mohammad rafee yaa kishor kumaar ke saath rahi ho athwa lata mangeshkar evam aashaa bhonsle ke saath; har jagah unki bahumukhi pratibha ne jaise alag-alag maanak tay kiye hai
 You will not forget his ever-present comic song Ek Chatur Naar (with Padosan, Kishore Kumar), nor the very experimental song Chad Gayo Papi Bichua (with Madhumati, Lata Mangeshkar)
 isi samay lata ke saath unke sadabahaar pranay geet aa ja sanam madhur chandani main ham (chori-chori), chunari sambhaal gori udi chali jaay re (bahaaron ke sapane) or dil kii girah khol do (raat or din) samaran main avashya based honge
 At the same time, i did not see the same sweet singers singing with Asha Bhosle, twisted and twisted (mr
 420), and the fairy of Sawan (silk handkerchief) with a slice of julfon

 The Supreme Court gave its decision on Thursday in connection with the 1994 Ismail Farooqui case related to Ayodhya Ram janmabhoomi-babrimsjid
 supreme court kii teen jajon kii bench ne bahumat yani 2-1 (paksh-vipaksh) ke faisle ke hisaab se apana nirnay sunaaya
 Two judges of the top court refused to refer the matter to the larger bench
 jabaki ek jaj ise badi bench main bhejne ke paksh main faisla diya
 However, the court said that the 1994 judgment would not have any effect on the Ayodhya case
 supreme court ke faisle ke baad ab ayodhya maamle main malikana haq ko lekar sunwaayee hogi
 This hearing will begin from October 29
 ayodhya maamle main sunwaayee kii baadha dur1994 ke ismail faruki maamle ke punarvichaar maamle par supreme court ne kaha ki ye faisla us samay kii paristhitiyon ke sangyaan main diya gaya tha
 In such a situation, there is no need to send it to a large bench
 court ke is faisle ke baad saaf ho gaya he ki ayodhya maamle kii sunwaayee main ab koi deree nahin hogi
 One party was saying that this case will have an impact on the original case, so it should be heard first
 29 oktober se is maamle kii sunwaayee shuru ho jaaegi
 The 1994 judgment on the Ayodhya case will not have any effect
 The Supreme Court's decision clearly stated that the judgment on the 1994 Ismail Farooqui case will not have any effect on the Ayodhya ownership case
 isse pehle bhi chif justise deepak mishra kah chuke hai ki ayodhya maamle main aasthaa ke aadhaar par nahin balki ek vivaadit jameen ke malikana haq ke maamle kii tarah dekhenge
 This is a clear indication that the arguments of faith will not go on in the Ayodhya case hearing, there will be a decision on the ownership of the land
 bataa den ki elahabaad hoicourt ke lakhanu bench ke 2010 main dwaara die faisle main 1994 ke ismail faruki maamle ko aadhaar banaaya gaya tha
 In the judgment, the land was divided between the three parties
 isamen do hissaa hindu paksh or ek hissaa muslim paksh ko diya gaya tha
 Mohammad Khalid Ahmad Khan, who advocated in court on behalf of Muslim party Maulana Fazlur Rahman in the Ayodhya case, says that after the Supreme Court's decision today, we do not have to prove that a mosque is not necessary in Islam
 aise main ye faisla kaaphi had tak hamaare kareeb he
 The court has clearly said that we will hear the ownership and give a decision
 supreme court ke aaj aae faisle kaa hindu pakshakaron ne bhi swaagat kiya he
 The Mahant of Hanumangarhi said that this is a historical matter
 sabhi pakshon kaa maananaa he ki ab malikana haq par jald sunwaayee ho jaaegi
 So far the people of Ayodhya who are involved in the dispute will also get relief
 dilachasp baat ye he ki ab ayodhya main vivaadit jameen ke malikana haq se jude maamle ko sunwaayee hogi
 The Supreme Court ruling that came on Thursday has no effect on both the temple and the mosque
 aise main jis paksh ke paas malikana haq ke thos aadhaar honge, uskaa paksh kaaphi majboot hoga

 The strong public demand for development in Bihar completely demolished the caste and religion fence and reassigned the Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (united) -bharatiya Janata Party coalition with a three-fourth majority in the assembly elections

 Accepting the defeat of his alliance in the assembly elections, Lalu Prasad said, "we accept the public opinion with respect

 a special meeting of the cabinet is to be held today on the new draft of the Women's Security Bill
 is vidheyak kii kuch baton par mantralayo ke bich matbhed the, jise sarkaar ne sulajhaa liya he
 In the new draft, the age of consent for sex has been reduced from 18 to 16
 is vidheyak ko mahilaon ke paksh main banaaya gaya he or gender neutral shabd hataa diya gaya he
 Sexual abuse of all kinds is included in the definition of rape
 balaatkaar ke doshi ko aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan karne vaala aapraadhik kanoon (sanshodhan) vidheyak mangalvaar ke cabinet kii vishesh baithak main pesh kiya jayega
 The bill, which is being drastically changed, has made rape a special gender-centric one
 vidheyak ko lekar cabinet main matbhed kii khabaron ko nakaarte hue kendriya grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha, ‘‘kanoonee binduon par kuch matbhed hai jiskaa nidaan kiya gaya he or cabinet kii vishesh baithak main kal vidheyak ko pesh kiya jayega
 'in this bill, the punishment for crimes against women has been made more stringent
 haal hi main paarit kiye gaye adhyadesh se yah vidheyak kam se kam chaar binduon par alag he
 It has a provision to make rape special gender-centric and proposes to remove the term 'sexual harassment' which does not discriminate on the basis of gender
 yadi badlaavon ko sweekaar kar liya gaya to iskaa matlab yah hoga ki balaatkaar kii kisi bhi ghatana kaa aarope sirf purushon par hoga
 These changes have been made in view of the demands being made by women's rights organizations
 mahila sanghathanon kaa kahana tha ki kanoon langink taur par udasin rahane se zyada acha he ki yah langik taur par samvedansheel rahe
 Another provision of the ordinance is likely to be removed through this bill
 adhyadesh main praavdhaan tha ki yadi kisi adhikari ko balaatkaar kaa doshi paaya jaataa he to use adhiktam umrakaid kii sajaa di ja sakegi
 But if the bill's proposal is accepted, the rape convict officer must spend his "natural life" in jail
 vidheyak main adhikari kaa matlab bhi samajhaayaa gaya he
 Under this, police or armed forces officers or doctors or employees of any hospital, jailer or warden of remand home will come

 He will die after one year

 thodi der baad savitri ne dekha ki anek duuton ke saath haath main pash liye yamraj khadey hai
 Yamraj took Satyavan's limp head and headed towards the south
 savitri ko aate dekh yamraj ne kaha, ‘he patiparaine! jahaan tak manushya saath de saktaa he, tumne apane pati kaa saath de diya
 Now you return
 ’ savitri ne kaha, ‘jahaan tak mere pati jaaenge, vahaan tak mujhe janaa chahie

 Savitri said, 'my father-in-law is blind, give him eye-light
 ’ yamraj ne ‘tathastu’ kahkar use laut jane ko kaha, kintu savitri usee prakaar yama ke peeche chalati rahi
 Yamraj asked him to ask for the groom again
 savitri ne var maanga, ‘mere sasur kaa khoyaa hua rajya unhen waapas mil jaae
 Saying 'yamraj' and 'aastru', he asked her to return, but Savitri remained adamant
 savitri kii pati bhakthi va nishtha dekhakar yamraj pigal gaye
 He asked to ask for another groom
 tab savitri ne var maanga, ‘main satyawan ke putron kii maa bananaa chaahati hum
 Please give me this blessing
 ’savitri kii pati-bhakthi se prasann ho is antim vardaan ko dete hue yamraj ne satyawan ko pash se mukt kar diya or adrishy ho gaye
 Savitri now came to the same tree
 vat vriksh ke neeche pade satyawan ke mrit sharir main jeev kaa sanchaar hua or vah uthakar baith gaya
 Satyavan's parents' eyes were fixed and the lost kingdom was returned

 Nitish Kumar does not usually react to the bjp's ever-evolving slogans and idioms, but he has a tear from senior BJP leader Sushil Modi
 or iske baad bihar ke purv mukhyamantri ne bijepi ko bhashaa kii maryaada banaae rakhane kii naseehat de di
 Nitish Kumar said, 'in political enmity, BJP is breaking all the limits of language with its values
 ' 20 july ko bijepi kii rajya kaaryakarini ke aakhri din apane samaapan bhaashan main susheel modi ne kaha tha ki lalu-nitish kii nai dosti jangalraj-2 kii taiyaari he
 Nitish was reacting to this statement
 nitish sarkaar main upmukhyamantri rahe bijepi netaa susheel modi ne kaha tha ki jis tarah aajkal filmon ke sikval ban rahe hai, usee tarah bihar kii raajnneeti main bhi ek sikval ban rahaa he
 In films, sequels like Dabangg-2 and Krish-2 were made, on the same lines, Jungleraj-2 is also being made in Bihar
 modi ne kaha ki lalu-rabari kaa purana raaj jangalraj-1 tha or ab nitish-lalu ke milane par jangalraj-2 kii taiyaari he
 Modi said that BJP first finished Jungle Raj-1
 ab nitish-lalu ke is jangalraj-2 ko bhi khatm karenge
 Nitish Kumar is credited with removing Bihar from Lalu Yadav's Jungle Raj
 unhen sushasan babu bhi kaha jaataa rahaa he
 But now when opponents started to associate his name with Jungle Raj, then Nitish was enraged
 jediu kaa maananaa he ki wo muhaavaron kii raajnneeti main yakeen nahin karti isliye modi ko jawaab main kuch nahin kahegi
 But the party knows that if the BJP has made Jungle Raj-2 a matter of discussion at the Chowk-intersections, then it can further increase Nitish Kumar's difficulties

 world cap se pehle champion ballebaaj sachin tendulkar ne ballebaajon ko australia or newjiland kii chunauteepurn pichon par apni safalataa kaa moolmantra bataate hue kuch tips die hai
 One of the most successful batsmen in the history of cricket, Tendulkar played six World Cups from 1992 to 2011
 sabase pehle vah 1992 main vishwa cap khele the
 In his World Cup column for the ICC, he wrote, Perth and Brisbane have fast and bouncy pitches, which will open the void of inexperience
 gendbaajon or ballebaajon ke liye galati kii koi gunjaaish nahin hogi
 If the batsmen understand the pace and bounce then the bowlers can dominate
 unhone kaha, gendbaajon ko in pichon par acchhee langth kii gend daalani hogi kyonki usamen chook hone par ballebaaj phayda uthaa sakate hai
 If you take advantage of the bounce by putting a good length ball then there will be a problem for the batsmen
 november 2013 main antarrashtriya cricket ko alavida kehane vaale tendulkar ne kaha ki ballebaajon ko newjiland main chalane vaali tej hawaaon se saavdhaan rahanaa hoga
 "in New Zealand, batsmen have to be careful with strong winds," he said
 hawaaen itani tej hoti hai ki ballebaaj kii timming par asar pad saktaa he
 Tendulkar, who scored 2278 runs in 45 matches in the World Cup, scored 482 runs in nine matches in 2011
 tendulkar ne kaha, newjiland ke maidan paaramparik rup se gol nahin hai
 In Australia, the Adelaide Oval boundary is shorter at point and square leg, but the straight boundary is much longer
 mehmaan team ke liye yah bada fark hoga kyonki isse field pojishans or gendbaaji kii ranneetiyon par asar padegaa
 He said, the boundary is also large on the big plains of Australia
 mujhe yaad he ki 1999 kii shrunkhlaa main phul boundry hua karti thi
 i scored a fourth run from Ricky Ponting's throw from the boundary
 riki kii majboot bhujaaon se phenke gaye thro ke baavjood ham chaar ran daud gaye kyonki hamen pataa tha ki gend ko wicketiper tak pahunchane main samay lagegaa
 "for players struggling with poor form, the extra fielder in the circle will be challenging as it will be difficult to rotate the strike," he said
 vahiin agar farm main chal rahe do ballebaaj krij par hai to gendbaaj ke liye sankat hoga

 However, he could not succeed

 Probably this is the reason why he was hurt in the elections

 mana ja rahaa he kidalitoramuslimvoton ke bikharaav ko rokane ke liye donon netaaon ne saath aane kaa faisla kiya he
 Let me tell you that Maharashtra has 17% Dalit and 13% Muslim population
 aurangabad, bid, nanded or osmanabad main badi taadaad main musalmaan rahete hai
 Apart from this, Muslim voters are also playing a decisive role in districts like Parbhani, Latur, Jalna and Hingoli
 jabaki dalit samudaay vaale kshetron main aurangabad, bid,latur, osmanabad or nanded aate hai
 Owaisi has been trying for a long time to establish his political roots in Maharashtra

 However, this alliance has increased the anxiety of parties like Congress and NCP more than BJP, as both parties also have their base in Muslim and Dalit communities
 donon dalon ke netaa is nae gathjod ko 'bijepi kii b team' bataa rahe hai
 Those watching the politics of the state are also considering this alliance as a 'vote cutting machine'
 jaahir he ki inke vot katane kaa phayda rajya main bijepi yaa shivasena ko milegaa
 However, Imtiaz Jalil, MLA from Aurangabad of AIMIM, dismisses these discussions
 wo kehete hai, 'congress or ensipi rajya ke musalamaanon ke liye kuch karne main lagaataar vifal rahi hai
 We have been opposing these parties as much as the BJP and Shiv Sena
 'bataa den ki maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena alag-alag chunaav ladenge
 At the same time, Congress and NCP have announced to contest elections together again in 2019

 It is not our desire to interfere in civil liberties, but to give arms training to a large number of people and to hope that they will also be used is not something to be encouraged
 ’patr main nehru ne kaha ki kuch prantiy sarkaron ne kach aisi patr-patrikaon par karrwai kii he jo samudaayon ke bich nafrat failaati hai
 In this case, except Pakistan's newspapers, if any newspaper can be blamed the most, then it will be RSS newspapers
 nehru ne apane patr main naaji andolanon kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki naaji party ne germany ko tabah kar diya or mujhe bilkul bhi andeh nahin he ki agar yah pravritiyaan isi tarah bharat main badhati rahi to vah bhi bharat ko bahut zyada nuksaan pahunchaayengi
 (pic Credit: Getty Images) This apprehension of Nehru proved to be true within a few days and on January 20, 1948, a bomb was thrown at Gandhiji's prayer meeting at Birla Bhavan, Delhi
 is ghatana ke do din baad hi 22 janvari 1948 ko nehru ne grahamantri or up pradhanmantri sardaar vallabh bhai patel ko patr likhaa
 In this, he wrote, For the past few weeks, most of Urdu and Hindi newspapers of Delhi are spewing poison
 gandhi ji ke upwas ke dauraan yah baat khaastaur par darj kii gai
 This newspaper or some of these newspapers are or are official organs of the Hindu Mahasabha
 hindu mahasabha or aresas ke ravaiye ko dekhte hue unke prati udasin bana rahanaa din-par-din kathin hota ja rahaa he
 These letters clearly indicate that Nehru was realizing the danger very fast
 29 disambar 1947 ko reva main aresas ke ek kaarykram main pahunche sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne sangh kii jamkar tarif kii thi
 Nehru also told him that i was sorry to read that you encouraged the RSS
 yah sanghathan maujuuda bharat main sabase zyada shararthpurna sanghathan he
 On 27 January 1948, just three days before the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru wrote a letter to the first director of the Intelligence Bureau, TG Sanjeevi Pillai
 isamen unhone kaha ki dilli or anya praanton se vibhinn stroton se jo khabaren mere paas pahunchi hai, unase pataa chalata he ki hindu mahasabha lagaataar aakraamak or uttejk gatividhiyon main shaamil ho rahi he
 Nehru asked Sanjeevi that if you know about all this then what action are you taking
 rashtrapita kii hatya se thik do din pehle 28 janvari 1948 ko nehru ne patel ko likhe khat main kaha ki sanyukt praant (ab uttar pradesh) sarkaar ke mantri laal bahadur shastri ne mujhe bataaya he ki aresas ke logon ko bharatpur main hathiyaaron kii training di ja rahi he
 Those who have gone to their camp have returned with weapons
 hindu mahasabha kii gatividhiyon se nehru baichaiyn the
 Nehru also talked to Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, who was the Industries Minister in his government
 mukherjee hindu mahasabha se jude hue the
 Nehru told him that now the water has reached the throat
 nehru ne kaha ki aap hindu mahasabha se kareeb se jude hue hai
 Because of this, we are being questioned
 ye halaat usee tarah aapako bhi sharminda kar rahe honge, jis tarah mujhe sharminda kar rahe hai
 After this Shyama Prasad Mukherjee distanced himself from the Hindu Mahasabha
 24 janvari ko kuch log birla bhawan ke get ke baahar khadey ho gaye or gandhi murdaabaad ke naare lagane lage
 Nehru was coming out after meeting Gandhi
 naare sunakar nehru apni car se neeche utre or jor se chillaaye, tumhaari yah baat kehane kii himmat kaise hui, aao pehle mujhe maaro
 The protesters walked silently on Nehru's shout
 mahatma gandhi ke prati aisi nafrat dekh nehru vyathit ho chale the
 Here Bapu also refused to take security
 baapu jitne bekhauf the, nehru utane hi baichaiyn
 Nehru suspects of being untoward

 Modi said, 'sister Mayawati has targeted me with regard to West Bengal

 Former CM Sheila Dixit is angry with Ajay Maken, a leader of the camp
 aaj kii vah raat he jab shaayad congressiyon ko is baat par neend nahin aegi ki vah haarenge yaa jeetenge
 He will be relieved that he will come to number two
 agar nahin aae to shila camp rahul ke chahete ajay maakan par hamalavar hoga jo khud ko dilli main rahul gandhi maanate hai
 Many angry leaders left the party Ajay Maken is accused by Sandeep Dixit that he runs the Delhi Congress from his pocket, like Rahul runs the Congress according to his own
 ajay maakan dilli congress main khud ko rahul gandhi bataate hai
 See the feeling of displeasure that Arvinder Singh Lovely, Minister in Sheila government, Amit Malik, President of Youth Congress of Delhi Pradesh, Barkha Shukla Singh, President of Delhi Mahila Congress, became angry with former Congress MLA Amrish Gautam Ajay Maken and left Congress 
 shaayad isiilie 'aaj tak' se baatcheet main shila ne saaf kaha ki emsidi main vot congress ke naam par padegaa, maakan ke naam par nahin
 So Sandeep said that Congress is seeking votes in the name of 15-year-old Sheila Sarkar
 maakan darpok hai, bujdil hai, tangadil hai or kam dimag ke hai
 His leadership seems to have been imposed
 ajay maakan par lagaae gaye ye aropasmasya yahaan nahin khatm hoti
 The problem is that everyone says that Maken does not pick up anyone's phone, does not come on the line
 virdohi kehete hai ki maakan rishte sudhaarna nahin chaahate, vah chaahate hai kijo virdohi hai vahacongresschhodkar chalaa jaae
 This should only occupy the Congress with Maken, this list is very long
 shila sarkaar main ahm role nibhaane vaale senior netaa eke walia naaraaz hai, duusare senior yogaanand shastri bhi naaraaz hai, mangatraam single bhi naaraaz hai
 Harun Yusuf is unhappy, Parvez Hashmi is also sitting quietly
 sutara bataate hai ki ajay maakan ne rahul gandhi ko apane saath rakh kar dilli pradesh congress netaaon kii lambii fehrist ko to haashie par daal hi diya
 Maken was also seen as a saharasath of Rahul Gandhi and even leaders like Kamal Nath Ahmed Patel Mukul Wasnik Oscar Fernandes were caught in the ticket distribution
 ab sabko intjaar he emsidi chunaav ke parinaam kaa or maakan ko sahaara he rahul gandhi kaa
 The truth is that if the Congress loses in MCD, will Rahul accept Maken as responsible or will Rahul admit that Maken tried hard, tried but the atmosphere was not good, so the Congress lost
 chunaav parinaam ke intjaar main congressi diggajamacan virdohi kehete hai ki jab baat aage badhegi to kendriya netaaon kii baat maakan ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab banegi
 So everyone is waiting for the results of the MCD election
 uske baad rahul gandhi ke kareebi ajay maakan kaa bhavishya tay hoga, haalanki puraane congressi kehete hai ki rahul jimmedaari tay nahin karte, javabdehi tay nahin karte
 He makes someone his partner and if he makes a mistake, remove him from one important place and take him to another important place
 kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki agar emsidi main maakan kharaab pradarshan karenge to dilli ke pradesh adhyaksh pad se hataakar shaayad unako congress kaa rashtriya mahasachiv bana diya jayega
 Now the voice will be raised that Rahul Gandhi is unable to fix the accountability and the Congress is standing at the crossroads, finding a way

 The Chinese military on Thursday confessed to encroaching in the Ladakh region's Depsang Valley for the first time last year, saying such incidents were caused by differing perceptions about the Line of Actual Control
 raksha mantralay ke pravaktaa karnal geng yaansheng ne kaha, 'pichley saal simavarti kshetra main kuch ghatana hui thi
 All issues were resolved through dialogue in a proper manner
 ' haalanki unhone depasang ghati kaa naam nahin liya jahaan pipuls libration army (piele) ke sainikon ne pichley saal april main us kshetra par apana niyantran jatalane ke liye kheme laga liye the
 Replying to a question at the press conference here, the spokesperson said, "the boundary line is not fixed and both sides have different interpretations about the Line of Actual Control
" ' is samvaadadaata sammelan main kuch chuninda videshi media ko aane kii ijaajat di gai thi or aisa chini sena ke itihaas main pehali baar hua
 Geng said that foreign media was called for a better and more objective understanding of China and the Chinese military
 pichley saal may main chini pradhanmantri lee quing kii bharat yatra se pehle depasang ghati main china ne atikaraman kiya tha jiske baad sainya or kootnithik tanaav paidaa ho gaya tha
 The issue was resolved after several rounds of talks and the Chinese troops withdrew
 pehali baar chini sena ne depasang ghatana kaa zikr kiya he, lekin usne ab tak yah nahin bataaya ki lee kii yatra se pehle chini sainikon ne aisa kyon kiya

 After 40 CRPF personnel were martyred in the terror attack in Pulwama, India has given a strong message that it is too much by snatching the status of Most Favored Nation from Pakistan
 dilli main paak ucchayukta ko bhi sarkaar ne talab kiya he
 Apart from this, India is considering taking many tough steps to teach a lesson to terrorists and Pakistan
 aaie jaanate hai ki bharat charam se charam kya kadam uthaa saktaa he
 However, there are many of these options which are very difficult to adopt
 1- MFN kaa darja khatm, ab puri tarah khatm ho kaarobaari rishtabharat ne pulavama hamale ke baad pakistan kaa most faverd nesan yani sabase tarjihi raashtra (MFN) kaa darja khatm kar diya he
 This will eliminate Pakistan's access to trade from India
 lekin bharat ne pakistan se sabhi vyapaarik rishte band nahin kiye hai
 So an extreme step may be to end the business relationship with Pakistan altogether
 yah kadam uthaaya ja saktaa he, kyonki bharat se pakistan kaa vyapaar kareeb 16,000 karod rupee kaa hi he
 There will not be much loss and this can be offset by trade with other countries
 2- saanskrithik rishte khatm karoek charam kadam yah ho saktaa he ki pakistan or bharat ke bich saanskrithik or logon ke yani person tu person rishton par roak lrga di jaae
 Under this, the entry of Indian artists, films, serials in Pakistan and the arrival of Pakistani actors, movies, serials in India can be banned
 iske alaava samjhauta train, bas, hawaii yatra aadi par roak lagaakar logon kii awajahi ko roka ja saktaa he
 This extreme step is possible, but it can be considered quite inhuman
 bharat or pakistan main tamaam log aise hai jinaki aapas main rishtedaari he
 Some's brother is in Pakistan and some one's uncle is in Hindustan
 saare sambandhon par roak laga dene se aise logon ko kaaphi mushkil hogi
 3- Break the back of Pakistan by declaring a terrorist country, India can declare Pakistan a terrorist nation on its behalf
 iske saath antarrashtriya samudaay par bhi yah dabaav bananaa hoga ki vah paak ko aatanki desh ghoshit karen
 After this, if India plays its diplomatic cards well, it can put Pakistan in a lot of trouble
 antarrashtriya str par pakistan ko alag-thalag karne ke liye sabhi deshon se baat kare bharat or duniya ke saamne pakistan ke aatankaparast chehre kaa pardaafash kare
 By putting pressure on the international level, India can impose various restrictions on Pakistan by other countries
 pakistan ke videshi funding par roak lagaai ja sakati he
 Not only this, India can put a condition in front of multinational companies that if they want to do their business in India then close the business with Pakistan
 yani unhen bharat or pakistan main se kisi ek ko chunanaa hoga
 In particular, the Gulf countries can be persuaded to impose various economic sanctions on Pakistan
 agar aisa ho sakaa to pehle se hi aarthik mushkilon kaa saamana kar rahe pakistan kii qamar hi tut jaaegi
 4- Then in response to the surgical strike Uri attack, the way India carried out the surgical strike in the year 2016, now a step can be taken to completely eliminate the terrorist bases of pok by making a surgical strike larger than that
 iske alaava jis tarah se america sil commando ne pakistan main ghuskar osama ko maaraa tha, usee tarah se bhartiya jaanbaaj commando pakistan main ghuskar hafiz said, masood ajahar jaise aatanki sarganaon ko khatm kar sakate hai
 However, this step is not so easy, because this time Pakistan is conscious
 5- dhara 370 or 35 e ko khatm karnabijepi khud lambey samay se samvidhan kii dhara 370 ko khatm karne kii maang karti rahi he
 This time it is an opportunity for the BJP government to do something in this matter
 yah bhi ek charam kadam hoga ki kashmir ke liye lagu dhara 370 or 35 e khatm kar vahaan puri tarah se bhartiya sarkaar kaa niyantran hasil kiya jaae
 With this, every kind of action will be possible for the government and if the government wants, then the population structure can also be changed by settling people from other parts of the country
 lekin yah vikalp bhi aasaan nahin he, kyonki ek to samvidhan sanshodhan kii prakriya bahut kathin he, duusare isse samooche kashmir ke log shesh bharat or bharat sarkaar ke khilaaf khadey ho sakate hai
 6 - Direct attack on Pakistan: Many Indians who are angry with the martyrdom of the youth are making such an argument that they should give a lesson like 1947 and 1965 by attacking Pakistan directly
 vaise bharat ne kabhi pehle hamalaa nahin kiya he, lekin ab aatankwaad ke nasoor ban jane kii vajah se logon kaa tark he ki bharat ko ek baar hamalaa kar yah khel khatm hi kar dena chahie
 However, this would be the last and the most extreme step
 bharat-pakistan main jang samooche duniya kii shanti bhang kar sakati he
 Both countries are nuclear
 isliye is jang main donon deshon ko bahut zyada jan-dhan kii haani hogi
 In such a situation, such an attack does not seem practical
 duusari baat yah he ki aise hamale main donon deshon kaa zyada nuksaan hoga
 Thousands, millions of people can be killed
 aise main yah daanv ulataa pad saktaa he, kyonki tab yahi log yah kahenge ki sarkaar ne 40 logon kii shahadat kaa badla lene ke liye hajaaron logon ko marava diya
 7- Stop two One way to teach a lesson to Panipakistan is that India should stop the water of rivers like Indus, Jhelum to Pakistan
 iske peeche soch yah he ki jab pioke yaa pakistan kii janata nadiyon ke jal ko tarasegi to pakistan sarkaar ko sabak milegaa or vah apane ghar ke aatanki addon ko nasht karne ko majaboor hoga
 However, a major hurdle in this move is that India has entered into several agreements on river water sharing with Pakistan and Pakistan will reach the international tribunal on this issue, which will complicate the issue in litigation
 iske alaava ek ashanka yah bhi he ki bharat main kai pramukh nadiyon kaa jal china se aata he, to agar apane dost pakistan ke samarthan main china ne bhi aisa koi kadam uthaaya to bhartiya janata ko samasya ho jaaegi
 8- One of the ways in which the terrorists in Kashmir can be chosen is to take action within the Marodesh, that the government should eliminate terror from Kashmir in the same way as during the times of Indira Gandhi and KPS Gill in Punjab
 it was done
 kashmir ke aatankwaad ke garh maane jane vaale ilaakon main lakhon kii sankhya main sena kii tainaati kar ek-ek gaanv main aatankiyon kii talaashi kii ja sakati he or unako chun-chun kar maaraa ja saktaa he
 The funding network of terrorists will have to be destroyed
 is abhiyaan kaa lakshya kashmir se aatankiyon kaa samul naash ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, the way to control the separatists who are supporting these terrorists may be that they are locked in other jails of the country outside Kashmir
 9- band karo khelkudpakistan ke saath sirf cricket hi nahin balki sabhi tarah ke khelon main kisi bhi toornament yaa match main shaamil hone par bharat apni taraf se roak laga saktaa he
 India can also say that in any tournament whether it is World Cup cricket, Asiad and Olympics, it will not play any match with Pakistan
 haalanki yah kadam vyaavhaarik nahin lagata, kyonki isse bharat ko bhi kaaphi nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 You cannot refuse to play against a team in international events, if a country does so, it will suffer a lot of damage
 10- seemaa par sakht karravampani seemaa ko majboot banane ke liye bharat kai sakht kadam uthaa saktaa he
 The policy of zero tolerance can be adopted for infiltration and other measures along the border
 iske alaava bharat seemaa par sainikon kii tainaati, hathiyaar or anya sainya sajo-saamaan kii tainaati badhaakar pakistan ko daraa saktaa he ki vah aatankiyon par karrwai shuru kare nahin to use nateeja bhugatna hoga

 Butra is born, Neelima is self-made, Mansa voluntarily and laughing due to physical appearance
 hijdaa samaaj sweekaar na hote hue bhi samaaj he, jahaan satya he or samvednaa bhi, bhukh he or tiraskaar bhi
 After all, why are we insensitive to that society? This is also the question
 kathakaar swayan bhavuk he-adhik bhavayukt, or chanda kii katha main leen he, vah bhul jaataa he ki ‘main hijdaa hum to isamen meraa kasoor kya he?’ jaise vaakya kai baar aa rahe hai
 There is also a discussion of love here

 Neither man nor woman nor manish purman phir prem! prem kya he yahaan? bhishma likhte hai, ‘kuch aisa hi prem chanda karne lagi thi manish se, jo deh ke str se bahut oonchai par pahunch chukaa tha, jise aadhyatmik prem kah sakate hai, maansik prem bhi kah sakate hai

 mumbai main yojit wethewomen event ke dauraan bollywood industry or raajnneeti ke kai diggaj darshakon se rubaru hue
 Filmmaker Karan Johar, Ekta Kapoor and Union Minister Smriti Irani answered many questions from the audience during this period
 baatcheet main desh kii maujuuda raajnneeti kaa shikaar ho raheen bollywood filmon par bhi sawaal uthaa
 Smriti Irani completely rejected it
 padmavati par smriti irani kaa you-turn, ab diya ye bayaandarasal, smriti irani se kisi audiyans ne poocha, filmon ko kyon target banaaya jaataa he? artistic filmon ko raajnneeti ke tahat dabaaya jaataa he? kya artistic freedom hogi?
 In response Smriti said, 'why does this question arise during the election itself
 kya ham log ek film ke piaar to nahin ban gaye hai
 i am happy with Prasoon Joshi's work
 vah kaaphi acha kaam kar rahe hai
 As a citizen, we need to work within the ambit of law
 'to kya padmavati par mekars ne kiya piaar stant ?filmon main sarkari hastkshep ko khaarij karte hue smriti ne kaha, 'agar aisa hota to kejariwal kii film kyon paas karte
 The film was released on Arvind Kejriwal
 isi sarkaar main relies hui
 This could not happen in the previous government
 is par raajnneetik phayda nahin hota, isliye charchaa nahin hoti
 'smriti Bolin', our government did nothing wrong
 agar main is maamle par saarvajanik taur par kuch boluungi to naa hi mujhe or naa hi sensor board ko, lekin jisane ye piaar stant kiya he use chot pahonchegi
 'smriti said, Karan, Ekta or i are from the industry
 ab main mantralay main hum
 We know what kind of tactics are being used for the PR of films
 padmavati: tharur ne maharaajaaon ko bataaya kaayar to smriti ne sindhiya-diggi se maanga jawabais kaarykram ke dauraan smriti ne filmon ko relies naa kiye jane par sarkaar kii manshaa or vajah to bataa hi di
 Apart from this, he also shared many funny things
 smriti ne share kiya 'tulsi' ke jail jane ko kissis kaarykram ke dauraan smriti apni jindagi se judaa ek mjedaar vakya share kiya
 Smriti told that when she once staged a sit-in for three-four hours in Mulund
 tabhi unhen police ne unhen arest kar liya or thane le gaye
 Smriti told that when she was arrested, the wives of the policemen reached there and said, why put Tulsi in jail? 
 smriti irani bani ministar, ekta kapur kaa riection- OH MY godekawa kapur ne smriti irani ke ministar banane par pehle riection kaa khulaasa kiya
 Ekta Kapoor told that as soon as she came to know about this, she said- 'oh my God
 ' is kisse ko share karte hue pataa chalaa ki jaise hi ekta ne phone kiya or kaha- to aaj se ham film or televijan ke bare main baat karnaa band kar denge
 And Smriti said yes
 ' iske baad ekta ne kaha ki smriti unke liye aaj friend kii tarah hai
 And 
 jaise ki kaha jaataa he ki mahilaayein mahilaon ko hi nicha dikhaati hai, ye sahi nahin hai
 We pursue each other and we have great respect for each other
 smriti boleen-nihlani senior hai, bhale hi unhone kisi bhi filmein banaai honyahi nahin smriti irani se jab karan johar ne poocha, 'menstream media main aap kisase prabhavit hai?', smriti jawaab main boleen, 'mujhe nahin pataa aapane unke bare main suna he yaa nahin, vah main stream media kaa hissaa nahin hai, or naa hi hameshaa hamaare saath vah sahamat hoti hai lekin vah arthvyavastha par behtareen tippanee karti hai, wo hai roopa subramanya

 ) teen talakavidheyak rajyasabha main bhale hi latak gaya lekin muslim personal lau board asamanjas se baahar nahin nikal paa rahaa he
 The 26th meeting of the board held in Hyderabad ended with a disputed statement by senior board member Maulana Salman Nadvi on the Ayodhya issue and the frozen ice could not melt on the issue
 board vidheyak ko sharia main dakhal bhi bataa rahaa he or kuch khaamiyon ko dur kar ise s+vikaar karne kii baat bhi kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, no way of consent has been opened between the government and the board
 supreme court ke nirnay se pehle jis model nikaahnaame kaa shor board ne machaaya tha, us par baithak main charchaa tak nahin hui
 The board is unable to do what it says, seeing the government's stand
 sab maanate hai ki ek saathtin talakaburaai he, lekin ise dur karne kaa mauka jab sarkaar ne hathiyaa liya to board ke paas vidheyak kaa virodh karne ke sivaay koi doosraa rasta nahin he
 a day before the meeting, board spokesperson Maulana khalil-ur-rehman Sajjad Nomani had said in Hyderabad, "the triple talaq bill is a big fraud
 ham iskaa virodh nahin karte, balki un kamiyon main badlaav chaahate hai jo muslim mahilaon or purushon ke moulik adhikaron ke khilaaf hai
 With this, the entire system of divorce is being ended
 ’’ sawaal uthta he ki vidheyak agar samasya he to phir samaadhaan kya he?teen talaak par supreme court kii sunwaayee main board ne kaha tha ki vah musalamaanon main sudhaar abhiyaan chalaane or model nikaahnamaa lagu karne ja rahaa he
 But even after two years this could not happen
 darasal vidheyak main badlaav tak model nikaahnamaa kii baat board chhedana nahin chahta
 There will be a contract at the time of marriage that the three will not divorce at once
 yadi aisa hua to yah anubandh patni ke liye court main ek majboot sakshya banegaa jo vidheyak ke praavdhaanon ke saath pati par dohari maar sabit hoga
 Uzma Naheed, senior vice president of All India Muslim majlis-e-mushawarat, says, "there is a delay in finding a solution in the Sharai realm
" islam main gender justise he or prastaavit vidheyak iske vipareet he
 a hundred percent man cannot be wrong on divorce
 ’’board kii sadsy rah chuki uzma baton hi baton main afsos bhi jaahir karti hai, ‘‘hamane ek dashak pehle model nikaahnamaa banaakar board ko diya tha or board ke kehane par 350 ulema ne ise jaancha-parkhaa
 But this could not apply
 varanaa aaj yah naubat hi nahin aati
 "maulana Nadeemul Wazdi, chief of the Deobandi Ulema and the All India Tanjim ulema-e-hind, takes the same point forward," the board model Nikahnama has presented to all Ulema
 gafalat kii vajah se ise lagu nahin kiya ja sakaa tha
 It is not too late now and it should be stamped
 ’’ lekin ab sarkaar ise pratishtha kaa prashn bana chuki he or khud pradhanmantri vidheyak ko rajyasabha main paarit karaane kii apni manshaa jataa chuke hai
 It is believed that the board was not given time to meet the PM before the Hyderabad meeting
 aligarh muslim uniwarsity main dharamshastra vibhaag ke dean dow
 Mufti Zahid Ali Khan considers it as such, "the board did not fulfill its responsibility
 ek baar main teen talaak ninsaphi thi jisaki sharia main bhi manaahi he
 An attempt could be made to solve it
 ’’ lekin board or sarkaar ke takaraav ko kaise dur kiya jaae? is par ve bahut bebaaki se kehete hai, ''sawaal yah nahin he ki sarkaar se baat karne main board ne der kar di yaa sarkaar ne mauka nahin diya
 The issue is that the PM is pro-muslim women and the board is presenting him as anti-muslim
 donon hi apni garima se baahar najar aate hai
 However, after the Supreme Court's decision, the Central Government had refused to enact a separate law on triple talaq, when the Board said that if the law is made, it will challenge in the Supreme Court, but now it will remove the flaws and accept it Talking kya vaaki isamen khamiyaan hai? jamiya millia islamia, dilli main ling bhugol vibhaag kii professor hasina hashia iskaa jawaab detii hai, ‘‘is bill ko loksabhaa main jaldbaaji main paas kar diya gaya he
 This should have been discussed with the board and Muslim women's organizations
 ek civil maamle ko sarkaar criminal shrenee main le ai he
 Prof
 Hacia is also a board member and has been raising voice on the board against triple talaq since 1990 together
 islamic duniya imam abu hanipha (hanfi) imam hambal (hambali) imam shafai or imam maalik (maaliki) chaar imaamon kaa anusaran karti he, jabaki shiya muslim imam jafar (abu hanipha ke guru) kaa anusaran karte hai
 Abu Hanifa has the highest followers in the world and is divided into Deobandi and Barelvi ideologies in India
 imam shafai se prerit ahal-e-haddees, salphi or wahabi hai jo ek saath teen talaak ko pehle hi nahin maanate
 But like the rest due to the handful in the country, they also support the Personal Law Board in collective religious matters
 bharat main ahal-e-haddees ke pramukh moulana asagar salphi kehete hai, ‘‘ham kuran or haddees par chalate hai
 In every phase we consider three divorces to be the same in a Majlis
 hanfi muslimon ne ise maan liya jo galat he
 The board needs to be reformed and the issue has been delayed too long
 phir bhi ham board ke saath hai or use model nikaahnamaa jald lagu karnaa chahie
 “but the model Nikahnama the board is referring to has existed for centuries against the evil of triple talaq among the conscious Muslims
 barelvi ulema or anjuman minhaj-e-rasul ke adhyaksh moulana saiyad atahar hossain dehalavi 11 rupye ke stamp paper par bane teen anubandh dikhaate hai jo unki nani, maa or patni ke nikaah ke samay unke naanaa, pita or unhone kiye the
 Among these, there are agreements between the husband and wife that they will not divorce without justified reason or in unholy conditions
 moulana dehalavi board kii bhoomika ko sahi nahin maanate
 He says, "the day Maulana Wali Rahmani, the general secretary of the board, targeted the PM on this issue, politics came to dominate the same day
 piem kisi party ke hon lekin unka pad sanvaidhanik he
 It is our constitutional right to speak to the government and the constitutional duty of the government to respond
 sarkaar ko katl or talaak main fark samajhnaa chahie
 The way the board refrained from talking to the government, similarly, the model is running away from presenting the Nikahnama
 ’’jis teen talaak ke masale par kanoon banane kii naubat ai, use kanoon ne bhale amaanya qaraar de diya lekin devbandi vichaardhaara main iskaa astitv baaki he
 Deobandi considers it as 'evil' and 'bidat', but also argues that if someone says divorce thrice at one time, then divorce is done
 sawaal vahi he ki majahab main ek aisi baat yaa rasm kaa astitv banaae rakhane kii gunjaaish kyon? jise buraai qaraar diya gaya or jo kuran or haddees se bhi sabit nahin
 However, the board did not find a solution, what the government is doing is also not a solution, then what is the solution? And how long will this question stand? However, somewhere the board is also afraid of fearing that if they lose this battle today, they should not defeat Muslim personal law tomorrow
 samaan naagarik kanoon kii sambhaavnaaen board ke vartmaan par baari hai or ek ‘buraai’ bachaane kii aad main astitv ke liye board apane vartmaan se bhi bhatak-sa gaya he
