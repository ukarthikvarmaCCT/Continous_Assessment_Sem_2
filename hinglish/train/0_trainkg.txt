 What should be the name of this action of Pakistan? Hate, bullying, enmity or something else? Date is a witness, it is now his nature to attack in secret
 or ab to wo aatankwaadiyon ko bhi faujee vardi pehanaane se peeche nahin hatataa
 But what should we do for those political leaders who, after every such attack in Pakistan, have lost their entire life by saying a jumla to give answers
 ab phir se sarhad par goli chali he, or ab phir se ek baar bas baton kii hi fasal lahalha rahi he
 Hate still dominates the boundaries of India and Pakistan drawn on the foundation of hate
 ek achche padosi ko chhodie ek achche dushman se bhi aisi dushmani kii ummid nahin thi, jo pakistan ne dikhaai
 Attacked like a coward in the dark of night and lost in the darkness
 sarhad par ladanaa, sarhad kii hifaazat ke dauraan maranaa-maarna har faujee kaa ferj he
 But it is not the job of the soldiers to attack the terrorists as a shield among the soldiers
 par afsos pakistan ye kaam bahut pehle se karata rahaa he
 Read: Nawaz Sharif's plan K: Infiltrate, but Pakistan government does not get hit in Poonch sector of Jammu and Kashmir at 3:30 in the morning, Pakistan's Mujahid regiment surrounded the Indian troops patrolling the Sarala post of Chakkan da Bagh from three sides
 Attacked
 hamaari tukdi choti thi
 Five soldiers martyred bravely
 par baad main pataa chalaa ki paak fouj ne ye hamalaa lashkar or jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankwaadiyon ke saath mil kar kiya tha or is hamale kaa mastermind tha hafiz said
 The purpose of the attack was to infiltrate the Pakistani terrorists into the Indian border under the cover of the attack
 is shahadat ne ek baar phir hamaari takat par sawaal khadey kar die hai
 Does our attitude on the border make us stand in the line of a weak country? Will we keep doing such big things just after every attack? Will you keep threatening enemies just by sitting in Parliament House? Or will you do something? And when will you? Read: If you hit 5, then you kill 50, answer the bullet with the bullet: Shahnawaz white lies are probably made for people like Pakistan
 nahin to bhala ye kaise mumkin tha ki jis pakistan ke phogiyon or hafiz said ke dehshatgardon ne milakar hindustan ke paanch javaanon ko shahid kar diya, vahi pakistan ye rat lagaae he ki elosi par to kuch hua hi nahin
 The question arises that who finally fired a bullet from Pakistan in the dark of night? a few days ago Hafiz Saeed challenged India
 iske baavjood pakistan ab na to iske peeche apni fouj kaa haath hone kii baat kubul kar rahaa he or naa hi hafiz said kaa
 The martyrdom of the Indian soldiers is itself the biggest proof of this brazenness of Pakistan
 sutron kii maane to ye hafiz said ke lashkar-e-taiyyaba or jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankwaadi hi the, jinhone is baar pakistani fouj ke saath milakar hindustani javaanon par ghaat laga kar hamalaa kiya
 The most shocking thing is that a few days before this attack, Hafiz Saeed was seen with Pakistani troops on the india-pakistan border last month
 thik vaise hi, jaise isi saal 8 janvari ko hindustani javaanon kaa sar kalam kiye jane kii vaardaat se thik pehle bhi said ko border par dekha gaya tha
 In fact, the Hindustani army received news of infiltration from Pakistan near Chakkan Da Bagh in Poonch sector
 isi ke maddenjar bihar rejiment kii ek ambush tukdi is ilaake main gasht kar rahi thi
 Pakistani troops and terrorists opened fire on them before they came to know of any intrusion, penetrated about 400 meters
 shaq he ki is hamale kii aad main kuch aatankwaadi ghuspaith kar hindustan main daakhil hone main bhi kaamyaab ho gaye
 However, no one has confirmed this intrusion so far
 aatankwaadi or pakistani fouj ek hi sikke ke do pahalu lagane lage hai
 Do not understand whether the Pakistani army is in the hands of terrorists or in the hands of terrorist Pakistan Army
 kyonki ye pehali baar nahin he, jab pakistan ne hindustan kii peeth main chura ghonpa he
 The stab that is in someone else's hand and the hand in someone else's sleeve
 aisi khabar aa rahi he ki 5 agast kii der raat poonch main pakistani phogiyon ke bhesh main aatankwaadi hi aae the
 The information that Defense Minister AK Antony gave to Parliament is clearly pointing towards the infiltration of terror in the Pakistani army

 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was heartbroken, he finally said that he should have the right to distribute tickets
 darasal, puraa vivaad hi isi baat kaa tha
 Everyone knows that Shivpal Yadav has a strong hold in the Samajwadi Party organization
 isliye sapa ke bhavishya akhilesh lagaataar yahi chaahate rahe hai ki sanghathan main unki pakad sabase majboot ho yani wo mulaayam kii samaajawaadee party kaa transfar apanani samaajawaadee party main karnaa chaahate hai
 In fact, in 2012, most of the tickets were distributed
 aise main sarkaar or sanghathan main unki hanak laazmi thi
 In comparison to Shivpal, Akhilesh wants to move forward with his new image, in which he wants a clear image away from bullying, hooliganism and corruption
 deepi yadav hon yaa mukhtaar ansaari, wo unka saath nahin lenaa chaahate
 He also wants a certain distance from Amar Singh, he does not like Azam Khan's bigotry, he gets rid of all his things
 akhilesh khud chunenge apni timaise main chunaav se thik pehle unhone tay kar liya ki bhavishya main wo apni team apane hisaab se banaaenge
 For this, it is necessary that the ticket should be distributed and if the government is formed, then Akhilesh's team should be with him, which should be according to Akhilesh
 lekin kahin agar satta naa bhi aaye to jite vidhayak unke samarthak honge or sanghathan par unki hi pakad or hanak hogi
 All the controversy over ticket distribution was like that Mulayam had already started trying to ease the path of Akhilesh from 2012 by sending all the leaders along with him to Rajya Sabha
 lekin shivpal kii sanghathan par pakad or aazam kaa muslim cheharaa hona unako bachaata rahaa, lekin mulaayam-akhilesh or ramgopal ke taaja daanv isi qavaayad ke liye rahaa ki chunaav main tikat baantne kaa adhikaar akhilesh ko mil jaye, jisase mulaayam kaa akhilesh ko puri tarah bagdor saunpane kaa sapana saakaar ho sake
 The reason why Akhilesh won and lost, is the reason that the issue is getting more complicated in the name of solving
 pad, ohada yaa vibhaag bhale hi shivpal yaa unke kareebi hasil kar len or sochen ki unhonenetaji or akhileshko jhukaa liya
 After winning the right to distribute tickets in the political battle, the real victory will be Akhilesh
 kul milakar bhale hi aaj jeet shivpal kii dikh rahi ho, lekin harkar jeetne vaala baazigar to akhilesh hi he

 bhartiya arthvyavastha ne apane darj itihaas main kisi timahi main sabase tej kareeb 8 fisadi kii vikaas dar 2008-11 main hasil kii thi
 Earlier this kind of growth was recorded only once
 vah 1980 ke dashak ke aakhri varshon kaa ek varsh tha, jo darasal darj itihaas ke sabase bheeshan suukhon main se ek ke turant baad dekhne ko mili thi
 The leading sectors in it were production and mining
 peeche-peeche nirmaan or sarkari kshetra the
 In fact, it is manipulated in the accounting of the country that the government's fiscal deficit is added to its total expenditure and hence it contributes significantly to the national expenditure
 lihaaja, vittiya ghate main vruddhi rashtriya kharch or aay, donon ko badha detii he
 The UPA government spent so much of its hands in 2008-2010 as if who cares about tomorrow
 lihaaja, us us daur kii apratyaashit vruddhi dar main, choti hi sahi, yah bhi ek mahatvapurn vajah thi
 The growth rate started to fall after that high
 meri gananaa ke anusaar, jo kendriya sankhyikeey karyaalay (siesao) kii ore se bataai jane vaali saal-dar-saal kii timahi vruddhi daron kii gananaa se thodi zyada parishkrut he, 2013 ke ant tak salanaa vikaas dar girakar 5 fisadi se neeche ho gai
 After that the decline stopped
 2014 kii jin timahiyon ke liye hamaare paas aankade hai, vruddhi dar 4
 2 to 4 9 or phir 5
 2 percent
 sakal gharelu kharch main vruddhi kaa rukh or tej rahaa, jo 2013 kii aakhri timahi main 4
 6 in the first three quarters of 2014, up from 8 percent
 1, 7
 4 and 6
 9 fisadi ho gai
 This rapid growth was driven by an increase in private consumption
 utpaadak kshamta badhaane vaala nivesh to us puure dauraan manda hi rahaa
 There was also a slight decline in the balance of payments
 lekin vah itani kam thi ki uskaa zyada asar na hua
 The industry sector had a hand in the decline after 2010
 chah saal pehle uskaa utpaadan kareeb das fisadi kii dar se bad rahaa tha
 In 2012 production actually declined
 teen saal pehle jo giravat shuru hui thi, vah jari he
 There is no significant increase in industrial production
 phir bhi jidipi main 6-7 fisadi kii sammanjanak vruddhi darj ho rahi he
 How does this happen? One industry that is growing at a rate of 6 per cent per annum is agriculture
 ham jaanate hai ki is utpaadan main bhi vruddhi kaise ho rahi he-sarkaar lakhon ton khadyann kharidkar unhen hameshaa ke liye bhandaron main dabaa de rahi he
 Apart from this, there is an increase in public services which is mainly due to energy production and distribution
 lekin sabase tej raftaar se badhane vaala kshetra vittiya sevaaon kaa he jo har saal 10 fisadi kii dar se bad rahaa he
 Who has been growing in this area, what are the services and whom he is selling, it is a mystery
 saare aankadon kii samiksha karen to nishkarsh yahi nikalataa he ki sab kuch chaupat ho rahaa he
 First, detailed industrial production figures show that they are declining; National figures show that they are growing at around 2 per cent
 donon baton main koi mail nahin
 Secondly, growth in GDP is being increasingly supported by consumer consumption; But it is not clear what consumers are buying in large numbers
 beshak ve krishi utpaada nahin ho sakate kyonki neshnal sample survey bataata he ki prati vyakti khadyann khapat do saal pehle hi charam par pahunch chuki thi
 It cannot even belong to the production sector because its growth rate is falling
 bachataa he seva kshetra
 There is no scope for this
 lekin tivi channelon kii sankhya charam par pahunch chuki he
 The number of films coming out of Bollywood is also not increasing
 paryaton main teji aa rahi he lekin vah itani nahin ki itnaa antar paidaa kar sake
 That is why the increase in consumer consumption is mysterious
 teesri baat, siesao ne jidipi ke aankadon kaa nayaa aadhaar tay kiya he
 It has also made radical changes in basic figures
 lekin bagaiyr kisi spashtikaran ke unhen lekar koi bharosa jataana mushkil he
 The conclusion is that as per the production data, the period of decline in GDP is going on, but according to the expenditure figures, this decline has stopped
 isaki jo sambhavit safai ho sakati he ki sarkaar apratyaksh karon ke rup main upabhoktaaon kii kharid kshamta main send laga rahi he, iskaa koi matlab nahin
 i have a lot of respect for government figures, but the figures that the government has put forward in the last two years do not really match
 vitt mantri ko bajet kaa focus tay karne ke liye arthvyavastha ke pradarshan ko samajhnaa hoga
 If the situation is inflationary, then they have to move the economy to deflation or the other way around
 apane antarim bajet main unhone apane purvavarti congressi mantri kii ore se tay kiye rajkoshiya ghate ke anupaat ko hi barkaraar rakhaa
 The only change he made was to replace the beneficiaries of the previous governments with those close to him and many party well-wishers got Rs 50-100 crore
 de daale
 The Finance Minister can do the same in his next budget
 lekin unhen kai sari vajahen aisa karne se rokegi
 The first is the industry
 udyogon kii haalat kharaab he or unhen bachaav ke upaay chahie
 The second is the Prime Minister, who is asking everyone to employ young people through 'make in India'
 vah utpaadan kshetra ko protsaahan dene vaale vistaaravaadi bajet kii apeksha rakhenge
 The third is the economists whom the government has brought in as the Chief Economic Advisor and the head of the NITI Aayog
 ye log videshon main apane falte-phoolate kariyar ko chhodkar badi ummiido ke saath bharat aae hai
 They would like to leave their impact
 arun jetali or vrihattar apekshaaon kii taraf bhi najar daal sakate hai or vitt mantri ke rup main apni bhi chhap chhodana chahenge
 If he thinks so, then there are many things to his attention
 unki pehali praathamikta guds and sarvice tex (jiesti) honi chahie
 He had said that his government would get a majority in both houses and that he would enact the necessary legislation by April
 ve apana vaada puraa nahin kar sakate
 Forgetting the majority point, they should concentrate on forming a consensus
 unhen samarthan ke liye pramukh vipakshi dalon ke saath baatcheet kerani chahie
 By implementing GST in 2015 they should remove all government barriers on the borders of states in the free movement of goods
 unhen suresh prabhu se railway ke aadhunikeekaran, vistaar or use gati dene kii yojana ke bare main poochna chahie or unhen nivesh ke liye dhan uplabdh karana chahie
 But in the case of highways, the scope is more than that
 dilli-mumbai audyogic corndor ne gujarat or rajasthan ko audyogikrut karne kii disha main badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 This motivating element should also be taken to the rest of the country by improving highways-mumbai-pune-bangalore-chennai, mumbai-nagpur-kolkata, East and West Coastal Highways among other metros
 jetali ko srilanka tak haive kii yojana ko bhi phir se khadaa karnaa chahie
 They should move towards building highways from Mizoram, Meghalaya and Tripura to West Bengal via Bangladesh
 lekin antarrashtriya haive bekaar honge agar bhartiya seemaa-shulk vibhaag adngebaaj bana rahata he
 Jaitley should initiate unilateral free trade with all neighboring countries — removing customs and other import restrictions for those who are neighbors
 isse ve najadik aaenge or bharat main unhen apane hit najar aaenge
 Even if it doubles their exports to India, it is not going to hurt them in our balance of payments situation
 ulate isse hamaare aarthik sambandhon ko nayaa swaroop milegaa
 The ratio of trade to GDP in India is one of the lowest in the world
 aisa mukhya rup se uski aayaat vyavastha ke chalate he
 This has led to under-investment in ports
 bharat main kuch hi prakritik bandargah hai, unamem bhi vyapaar kaaphi pratibandhit he
 Jaitley should provide funds to build a dozen medium sized ports
 saath hi aise 80,000 ton kii kshamta vaale jahaajon kaa bhi nirmaan karnaa hoga jo un bandargahon kaa istemaal kar saken
 They should aim to divert a large part of domestic trade from the land and set up a framework for expanding trade through the Indian Ocean
 bhartiya udyog ke saamne sabase badi baadha ati-niyamit or kam-viksit vittiya bazaar hai
 There are many savers and many affluent people in India, but the methods of financial intermediation are so low that those who are rich invest outside and invest the rest in real estate
 natijatan antarrashtriya maanakon ke lihaaj se bharat main jameen kii keemton or prati vyakti jidipi ke bich kaa anupaat bahut zyada he
 India is one of the oldest and most active capital markets
 phir sudhaaron ke naam par usne ek ke baad ek niamak khadey karne shuru kar die
 Regulators like labor-intensive and paper-laden SEBI have abolished the capital market and bond markets cannot emerge without capital markets
 jetali ko sebi ko kahana chahie ki vah apane niyamanon ko 90 fisadi kam kar de, un saare afasarshahon ko lautaa de jinhen usne pratiniyukti par rakhaa he
 He should learn from the light-weight regulation system of countries with successful financial industries such as Britain, Singapore, Hong Kong and Luxembourg
 mere paas or bhi kai suzav hai, lekin unhen abhi barbaad karne kaa koi matlab nahin
 If Jaitley proves himself to be understandable, then there will be many more opportunities to suggest him as there is little chance that this government will fall or the Prime Minister will get rid of his Finance Minister

 to dekhie is video ko or agar ise dekhakar aapako apni yaa kisi duusare kii shaadi kaa koi kissa yaad aa jaae to neeche coment box main share bhi kiijie - Sachin Tendulkar's failure in the recent Test series against New Zealand has triggered a discussion as to whether he should retire, but West Indies legend Brian Lara believes the Indian star can play two more years
 lara ne kaha, main jaanata hum ki vah khel ke twanti-20 praaroop se pehle hi baahar ho chuke hai
 i am not sure whether he is playing a 50-over match or not, but as far as Test cricket is concerned, he can play two more years
 vah ab bhi test or ek-divasiy antarrashtriya cricket main dher saare ran bana sakate hai
 The former West Indies captain, who started his international career after a year with the Indian batsman, said Tendulkar has no answer and whenever he retires, the cricket world will miss him
 unhone kaha, main samajhataa hum ki unhone (tendulkar) behtareen bhoomika nibhaai he
 Who, i am not sure, has started playing (international) cricket for 15 or 16 years and is still playing
 is tarah se unhone mere se ek yaa do saal pehle khelnaa shuru kiya or mere sanyas lene ke paanch saal baad bhi vah khel rahe hai
 Lara said, he is close to completing 25 years in international cricket and not only Sachin, but all Indians should be proud of it

 i believe that he has played a great role and when he retires, world cricket will miss him a lot
 lara ne kaha ki tendulkar bhadrajan hai or aisa cricketer hai, jis par vishwa cricket ko hameshaa naaj rahegaa
 He said, i played with and against him on a few occasions
 main samajhataa hum ki vah bhadrajan hai or vishwa cricket ko un par naaj hona chahie
 Lara also praised Mahendra Singh Dhoni's captaincy and said that the Indian captain should be allowed to decide his future
 tippaniyan He said, in the last four-five years, he has played a great role as an Indian captain
 main samajhataa hum ki unako lekar sawaal uthaae jate rahe hai, lekin keval vahi jaanate hai ki unhen kab sanyas lenaa he
 No captain likes to be dismissed
 isliye unhen apana bhavishya khud tay karne kii chhot milani chahie
 Lara said that if the West Indies team plays as a unit, they can also win the title
 unhone kaha, west indies kii team bahut acchhee he, lekin ve tukdon main acha pradarshan karte hai
 They have the best batsman, best bowler and best all-rounder, but they have to perform collectively

 ahmednagar jile ke gundegaanv main shikshak rahe 84 varshiya rajaraam bhapakar ne pichley 57 varshon main saat pahadiyon ko katkar 40 kilometre lambii sadak banaai or is chamatkaar ke liye kshetra main vah sammanit naagarik hai
 Bhapkar is affectionately called 'bhapkar Guruji', who looks like a normal villager
 vah ujali kameez or pajama pahante hai or ‘gandhi’ topi lagaate hai
 However, this simplicity also has a steel commitment
 bhapakar ne kaha, ‘‘swatantraaa ke samay gundegaanv ko aasapaas ke gaanvon se jodne ke liye ‘pevat’ (pagadendi) bhi nahin thi
 He has studied till seventh grade
 varsh 1957 se 1991 tak jila parishad kii skool main kaam karne vaale bhapakar jab colegaanv main kaam karte the to unke gaanv ke logon ko vahaan tak pahunchane main teen gaanv paar karke aana hota tha
 Bhapkar had asked government officials to cut the 700-meter-high Santosha Hill and build a road
 koi sahyog nahin milane par apni saahas or patibaddhta se 57 varshon main unhone 40 kilometre lambii sadak banaai, jiske baad saat sadaken baniin, jo unke gaanv ko aasapaas ke gaanvon se jodatii he
 The comments isse pehle deulgaanv se hote hue colegaanv tak maarg 29 kilometre lanbaa tha

 The level of umpiring in this match was not as expected
 england ke captain eon morgan kaa maananaa he ki ninaryak kshanon kaa ek mahatvapurn faisla unki team ke khilaaf gaya
 In the last over, Joe Root will take the issue of the umpire's decision to deliver LBW off Bumrah to the England Match Referee
 morgan ne kaha ki jo root ko match ke nirnaayak kshanon main pagabaadha out hone ke ampire ke faisle ke kaaran hi unki team ko doosraa tii20 match ganvaana padaa
 Umpires of the match c
 shamsuddin ne root ko aakhri over main jasprit bumraah kii gend par elbeadblyoo out diya jabaki riple main yah saaf dikhaa ki gend parale balle se lagi thi
 The England captain said, 'we are very angry with that decision
 isse 20wein over main match kaa pasa palat gaya
 Losing the wicket of a batsman who has played 40 balls proved fatal for the team as the wicket was very slow at that time
 ’ unhone kaha,‘kai faisle hamaare paksh main nahin gaye
 We could have won that match but could not win, which is quite disappointing
 vaise morgan ne kaha ki unki team ke paas agle match ke jariye vaapasi kaa mauka he lekin hamane match referi ke jariye feedback main apni pratikriya de di he
 He also denied that he got out after playing a bad shot after settling at the crease

 Asked whether he was disappointed with not using DRS in T20 matches, the England captain said, "to an extent
" yadi worldcup ke maichon main bhi iskaa istemaal kiya jaae to acha hoga
 It should be used in T20 matches
 ’unhone yah bhi kaha ki tii20 maichon main gendbaaji or ballebaaji kaa acha santulan hona chahie

 This ratio is 70
 30 hona chahie
 ' england ke captain kaha,‘ham us faisle se kaaphi naaraaz hai
 This reversed the match in the 20th over
 aise ballebaaj kaa wicket ganvaana jo 40 gend khel chukaa he, team ke liye ghaatak sabit hua kyonki us samay wicket kaaphi dhimaa ho chukaa tha
 He said, 'many decisions did not go in our favor
 ham vah match jeet sakate the lekin nahin jeet sake jisase kaaphi niraashaa he
 By the way, Morgan said that his team has a chance to return through the next match but we have given our feedback in the feedback through match referee
 ’ unhone is baat se bhi inkaar kiya ki krij par jamane ke baad vah kharaab shot khelkar out hue

 Afzal Ansari, the president of the Qaumi Ekta Dal, which has a political influence in the eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh, hinted at an alliance with AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, claiming that Owaisi is 'untouchable' due to allegations of being close to the BJP
 Why is SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav allegedly 'untrained and walking with hands'? coed adhyaksh ne kaha ki unki party aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main gathbandhan ke silsile main agast main koi faisla legi
 Talking about his strategy for the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Ansari said that it is foolish to declare in such a big battle alone, he will have to find a partner for it
 unke anusaar, vah chaahate hai ki siyasat main nijee nekanami or badanaami kii vajah se koi bada phayda un phirakaaprast takaton ko nahin pahunche jinase ladate hue unhone 35-40 saal kaa raajnneetik safar tay kiya he
 The SP also includes such powers

 halaat or vakt kii najaakat insaan ko naye faisle lene ke liye majaboor karti he
 Asked about Owaisi's allegations of leaning towards the BJP, Ansari asked, "first of all, let us know whether the people of Samajwadi Party have no relationship with the BJP
" kya basapa ke rishte bhaajapa ke saath nahin he
 Owaisi or Afzal Ansari do not need to get a character certificate from anyone to be secular
 ’’ unhone kaha ‘‘agar ovaisi bihar main vidhansabha chunaav ladane gayi the, to kya mulaayam singh nahin gayi the, kya yah sawaal sapa mukhiya se nahin kiya jayega
 Did Mayawati not go to Gujarat, did Mulayam Singh not go to Gujarat? log halaat or vakt ke hisaab se faisle lete hai
 We are thinking seriously that none of our steps should benefit the reclusive forces
 ’’ The Kaued president said that his party will take a decision in August regarding the alliance in the upcoming assembly elections
 ansaari ne baatcheet main uttar pradesh ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar apni ranneeti kii charchaa karte hue kaha ki akele itani badi jang main elaan karnaa bevakoofi kii baat he, uske liye saathi talash karne honge
 According to him, he wants that due to personal goodwill and slander in the politics, no great benefit should be reached to the reclusive forces against whom he has traveled a political journey of 35-40 years

 The comments uttar pradesh main jaden jamaane kii koshish main juty ovaisi kii party eimm se gathbandhan kii sambhaavna ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki ovaisi koi ‘achhut’ nahin hai

 '' chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh ko vishwa adivasee diwas ke maukey par badi raahat mili he
 The tribals have accepted him as their leader and have rejected the demand of the old tribal chief minister over the years
 adivasee netaaon ne saaf kar diya he ki mukhyamantri raman singh har haal main unhen sweekaar hai
 Because no government has done as much work as it did for the welfare of tribals
 darasal, chhattisgarh ke gathan ke baad se hi rajya main adivasee mukhyamantri kii maang chali aa rahi thi
 This attitude of the tribals just before the assembly elections is being considered as a big step for the BJP
 raipur main yojit vishwa adivasee diwas kaa mukhya samaaroh rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ke liye mile kaa pathar sabit hua he
 In the indoor stadium, all the big tribal leaders from all over the state accepted their leader by wearing a gazamala on the stage to Chief Minister Raman Singh
 unka bade athmiya dhang se swaagat hua
 Women, men and young people garlanded them with flower garlands
 paramparaagat nrity or adivasee lok kalaon se saji vishwa adivasee diwas kii mehfil puri tarah se rangeen najar aa rahi thi
 Gadgad also appeared in Chief Minister Raman Singh
 puure kaarykram main wo muskuraate rahe
 Village town from the tribal leaders who came from the , the people of the tribal community had also gathered here from the hills of Surguja and Bastar
 saamaajik rup se sabhi netaaon ne mukhyamantri raman singh ko naa keval apana samarthan diya balki unki is baat ke liye peeth thapthapai gayi ki 15 saalon main jo kaam unhone adivaasiyon ke vikaas ke liye kiya he, utana pehle kabhi nahin hua
 No matter what the government has been, but it has not been as sensitive for the tribals as Raman Singh and his government paid attention to
 lihaaja adivaasiyon ne ek swar se mukhyamantri raman singh ko apana netaa hi nahin balki saamaajik bandhu mana
 The tribals gave credit to Raman Singh for the all-round development in Bastar, but many people thanked the Chief Minister for his efforts to maintain the urge to study within 30 thousand children by providing free education and facilities
 manch se is baat kaa elaan kiya gaya ki lambey arase baad adivasee bacchon ne UPSC kii parikshaon main baaji markar bastar kaa maan badhaayaa
 Political workers, mlas and leaders attended the event in Raipur's indoor stadium, except for the mlas of the main opposition party Congress
 mukhyamantri raman singh kaa puraa mantrimandal bhi yahaan maujuud tha
 On this occasion, the ministers of the Adisasi community described Raman Singh as their real leader
 in netaaon ke mutabik 15 saal pehle or ab ke adivasee samaaj main jameen aasmaan kaa fark he
 According to him, Raman Singh has left no stone unturned for the welfare of tribals on social, intellectual, economic and all other fronts
 varsh 2011 kii janaganana ke aadhaar parachhattisgarhmen adivaasiyon kii aabaadi 32 fisadi aanki gayi thi
 Which has increased to more than 35 percent in 2018
 varsh 2001 main rajya gathan ke dauraan se adivasee mukhyamantri kii maang or unhen samuchit netritv ko dene ko lekar sarkaar or adivaasiyon ke bich rassakashi chali aa rahi thi
 The Congress had appointed Ajit Jogi as the chief minister
 lekin varsh 2003 main bijepi ne raman singh ko mukhyamantri kii kursi par baitaakar adivasee mukhyamantri kii maang ansuni kar di thi
 Since then, this demand has been rising in social forums and political movements of tribals
 lekin vidhansabha chunaav ke thik pehle is maang ke khaarij ho jane se adivasee ilaako main bijepi kii jaan main jaan aayi he
 Tribal leaders have claimed that this time the BJP will win all the assembly seats in Bastar and Surguja
 kyonki unke saamaajik bandhu raman singh ko phir ek baar mukhyamantri bananaa he
 Tohungama also began the second phase of the budget session in Parliament on Monday
 centre sarkaar kii ore se rajeev pratap rudi ne ek baar phir sanshodhit bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko pesh kiya

 The Congress alleges that the government wants to pass the bill through the back door

 Mulayam said, 'modi will destroy farmers
 ' jaahir par iske sidhe sanket hai ki janata parivaar bhi sadan main sarkaar ko gherne kii taiyaari main he
 Rahul Gandhi's attack is important because Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi attacked the Modi government fiercely in the Lok Sabha on Monday
 agyatavaas se laute rahul ne kaha, 'modi sarkaar suut-boot vaali sarkaar he
 The government has forgotten farmers for industrialists
 desh kii 60 fisadi janata kheti par nirbhar he, lekin main sarkaar se poochna chahta hum ki itani badi aabaadi par gussa kyon?' rahul gandhi ne apane bhaashan main aage kaha ki achche din kii sarkaar fail ho gai he or kisaanon ko bhagwaan bharose chhod diya gaya he
 Venkaiah responded to the allegations of Jawaharulul Gandhi by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu
 venkaiya ne kaha, 'sarkaar kisaanon ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 It has also been announced to provide compensation to farmers whose 33 percent crop was wasted
 'in sab ke bich rahul gandhi ne loksabhaa main apane bhaashan par khud hi apni peeth thapthapai he
 The Congress vice president told Aaj Tak that the speech was good, but did not get a reply
 desh main teen talaak ko lekar bahes garm he, to talaak ke maamle bhi lagaataar saamne aa rahe hai
 The latest case has surfaced in Hyderabad
 jahaan ek shuhar ne postcard par teen baar talaak likhakar apni bivi ko bhej diya
 But the wife resorted to the law to teach her husband a lesson and filed a case against him
 teen talaak ke maamle par jis tarah se puure desh main bahes chal rahi he, usee tarah setin talaakke maamle bhi har din saamne aa rahe hai
 a Muslim woman living in Hyderabad was surprised when she received a postcard by post
 postcard uske pati ne bheja tha
 Seeing the postcard, the woman's senses flew away
 darasal, postcard par uske pati ne teen baar talaak likhakar use bheja tha
 He wrote that he was divorcing her
 ab unka koi sambandh nahin he
 The woman got upset seeing this
 lekin usne samajhadaari se kaam liya or pati ko sabak sikhaane kaa man bana liya
 The woman went directly to the concerned police station and filed a case against her husband
 police ne maamle ko gambhirtha se lete hue dabish dekar aaropee pati ko giraftaar kar liya
 Significantly, earlier in the Saharanpur district of UP, pregnant woman Shagufta also filed a case against her husband for three divorces
 saath hi usne piem modi ko patr likhakar teen talaak ko khatm karne kii maang kii thi

 The decision in this case is likely to be secured on Wednesday
 adaalat is maamle main buudhvaar ko faisla surakshit kar leti he to janvari maah main hi is maamle main bhi faisla aa jane kii puri sambhaavna he
 Earlier on January 6, the CBI Special Judge Shivpal Singh's court in Ranchi had sentenced Lalu Yadav to three and a half years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs five lakh in a fodder scam case involving the Deoghar treasury
 ab lalu ke pasjamantake liye hai court kaa darwaja khatkhatane ke alaava koi anya chaara nahin bachaa he
 According to PTI news, CBI sources said that in this case of fraudulent withdrawal of money from Deoghar treasury, CBI against Lalu Prasad Yadav and others related to criminal conspiracy, embezzlement, forgery, concealment of evidence, misuse of post etc
 a case was registered under sections 120B, 409, 418, 420, 467, 468, 471, 477A, 201, 511 of Indian Penal Code under Prevention of Corruption Act

 Former IAS officer and Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement chairman Shah Faisal on Saturday expressed concern over the deployment of additional central security forces in Jammu and Kashmir and said that there was a rumor that something terrible was going to happen in the valley
 iske baad atakalein shuru ho gai ki kya centre sarkaar anuchhed 35-e ko khatm karne ja rahi he
 Politics also started on this
 mahabuuba mufti ne kaha ki 35e ke saath chhedchhad barood ko haath lagane ke baraabar he
 All Kashmiri leaders including Omar Abdullah advised to avoid any tampering with 35-A
 yahaan yah jaananaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki aakhir kya he anuchhed 35-e
 Why voice is being raised to remove it across the country and if it is removed then why do the Kashmiri leaders have objections
 kaise bana charchaa kaa vishaydrasal ye maamla supreme court main bhi chal rahaa he
 However, the decision on this has not yet come
 anuchhed 35-A ke khilaaf 5 saal pehle varsh 2014 main supreme court main yachika daali gai thi
 Since then, this matter has remained the center of debate in the country and protests in Kashmir
 aise main ye samajhnaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki aakhir kashmir se judaa samvidhan kaa anuchhed 35-A kya he or kyon ise kashmir main algaavvaad kii jad bataaya ja rahaa he
 Article 35-A, which was not part of the original constitution, was added to the constitution in 1954, 7 years after independence
 ye anuchhed nehru cabinet kii sifarish par tatkaaleen raashtrapati dow
 Was added to the Constitution by an order of Rajendra Prasad
 iskaa aadhaar he 1952 main pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru or jammu-kashmir ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri shaikh abdulla ke bich hua dilli agreement
 In which case of Indian citizenship was considered as a state subject in the context of Jammu and Kashmir
 kya vishesh adhikaar detaa he ye anuchhed35-a samvidhan kaa wo anuchhed he jiske tahat kashmir ke sthaayee nivaasiyon ke liye niyam tay hue hai
 Permanent residents of Kashmir have been given special rights and facilities under this Article related to facilities related to jobs, property purchase-inheritance, scholarship, government assistance and welfare schemes
 raashtrapati ke aadesh se samvidhan main judaa ye anuchhedrashtrapati kaa ye aadesh samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 (1) (d)ke tahat jari kiya gaya tha
 This provision empowers the President to make changes and exemptions on the subject of the state in the case of Jammu and Kashmir as and when required in the Constitution
 anuchhed 35-A se judi khaat baat ye he ki ise banaate samay sansadeey pranali se kanoon banane kii prakriya kii jagah raashtrapati ke aadesh ke jariye ise samvidhan main joda gaya
 Whereas Article 368 (i) of the Constitution gives the right to any amendment to the Constitution only to the Parliament
 1961 main ye maamla aadalat ke saamne aayaa tha ki kya raashtrapati 370 ke tahat sansad ko bypass karke samvidhan main sanshodhan kaa adhikaar rakhte hai
 However, the court's decision did not elicit an answer then
 kin tarkon ke aadhaar par di gai court main chunauti?2014 main supreme court main ek enjio ne yachika daayar kar is anuchhed ko ek bharat kii bhaavana ke khilaaf or algaavvaad ko badhaava dene vaala praavdhaan bataaya
 The legality of Article 35A and Article 370 was challenged in this petition
 is yachika main tark diya gaya ki aazaadee ke baad desh kaa samvidhan banane ke liye jo samvidhan sabha bani thi usamen jammu-kashmir ke 4 pratinidhi bhi shaamil the
 Also, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was never given special status
 ye bhi tark diya gaya ki 35-e ek asthaayee upbandh tha jise rajya main halaat ko us samay sthir karne ke liye joda gaya tha
 The framers of the Constitution did not make this article
 algaavvaad ko badhaava dene kaa kyon lagata he aaropayachika main yah bhi kaha gaya ki ye anuchhed nagarikon ke bich bhed utpann karata he or ek bharat kii soch ko kamjor karata he
 This article prevents the people of the rest of the states from getting jobs in Jammu and Kashmir, buying property which is a violation of the fundamental rights given in the Constitution
 desh ke har naagarik ko samvidhan ke anuchhed 14, 19 or 21 main mul adhikaar yani fundamental ritis die gaye hai
 Another petition filed with this has also challenged the provision of women of Jammu and Kashmir not getting citizenship if their children marry an outsider
 is kanoon ke praavdhaanon ko kashmir main algaavvaad ko badhaava dene vaala bataate hue khaarij karne kii maang kii gai
 In fact, the boil in the political parties in Kashmir is the result of the fear of ending it
 kyonki isse algaavvaad par roak lagegi or sthaneey dalon ke vot bank par bhi chot padegi
 What are the provisions in Article 35-A: - Article 35-A sets the rules of permanent citizenship for the state of Jammu and Kashmir and the rights of citizens - The Government of Jammu and Kashmir considers those who are permanent residents in Kashmir before 14 May 1954 They were settled - such permanent residents have got rights to buy land in the state, get employment and benefit in government schemes
 -kisi duusare rajya kaa nivasee jammu-kashmir main jaakar sthai nivasee ke taur par nahin bas saktaa-kisi duusare rajya ke nivasee naa to kashmir main jameen kharid sakate hai, naa rajya sarkaar unhen naukari de sakati he-agar jammu-kashmir kii koi mahila bharat ke kisi anya rajya ke vyakti se shaadi kar le to uske adhikaar chin jate hai, haalanki purushon ke maamle main ye niyam alag haiudaaharan ke liye jammu-kashmir ke purv siem umr abdulla kii bahan sara abdulla rajya se baahar ke vyakti se vivaah karne ke baad sampatti ke adhikaar se vanchit kar di gai thim jabaki umr abdulla kii shaadi bhi rajya se baahar kii mahila se hui, lekin unke bacchon ko rajya ke saare adhikaar hasil hai
 The petition sought to abolish such discriminatory rules and implement similar laws across the country
 ab 35-e ko khatm karne kii atakalon ke bich desh main ek raashtra-ek kanoon kii maang phir tej hone lagi he

 Anand Kumar met Sibal in New Delhi and made several important suggestions regarding the new pattern of IIT entrance exam
 unhone kaha ki pattern tanaav rahit or skulon kii padhai par aadhaarit hona chahie
 Kumar expressed concern that the new pattern has not been announced yet and coaching institutes are starting to charge a hefty amount in the name of preparing the new pattern
 unhone kaha ki jis tarah se 12veen ke ankon ko vettege dene tathaa aptitute test ko shaamil kiye jane kii baat kii ja rahi he, usase chaatro ko teen tarah ke koching sansthaanon main jane kii jarurat padegi
 He said that in such a situation coaching cannot be eliminated and students will need to go to coaching institutes for class 12th, subject of IIT and for aptitude test
 unhone kaha ki aisi sthiti main amir gharon ke bachche to kharch vahan kar lenge lekin nirdhan parivaar ke bacchon ke liye vishesh samasyaayein paidaa hogin
 Kumar advocated a single test based on the knowledge of 12th standard
 unhone kaha ki jab ames main single test ke jariye chaatro kaa daakhila ho saktaa he to iaiti main aisa kyon nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He said that AIIMS entrance examinations are more competitive in terms of seats
 unhone kaha ki iaiti pravesh ke liye test paper 12veen ke gyaan par aadhaarit hona chahie or iske liye iaiti ke professor sibiesai ke visheshgyon ke saath milakar paper taiyaar kar sakate hai
 Kumar, who is famous around the world, advocated giving three opportunities to rural and poor students in the IIT entrance exam and said that doing so would not only increase their participation but also would not require coaching
 unhone kaha ki gramin kshetra ke chaatro ko teen mauka diya janaa chahie
 He said that children from rural areas do not get enough opportunity to enter iits
 ullekhneey he ki abhi iaiti pravesh pariksha main sirf do baar hi shaamil hone kii ijaajat he
 Anand Kumar hoped that Sibal would take his suggestions into consideration
 sibbal ne kumaar ko aashwaasan diya he ki iaiti ke nae pattern ko taiyaar karte samay unke sujhaavon ko dhyaan main rakhaa jayega

 It is said that many cannot stop the storm
 vah jab aata he to bade-bade bargad apneaap ukhd jate hai
 Novak Djokovic has proved to be the storm in the tennis world
 unke saamne rafoyal nadal or roger federer jaise diggaj ukhdate dikh rahe rahe hai
 He is creating a new history of success
 australian open ke rod lever erina main khele gaye final mukaable ke pehle set main endi mare ne jab novak jokovich ko tham liya to mere man main ek ashanka uthi ki kya mare yahaan itihaas bana denge
 Given the way Murray defeated Federer in the semi-finals, this apprehension was also likely to come true
 lekin, novak jokovich ko maaloom tha ki agar yah muqabla lanbaa khinchaa to phayda unako hi hona he
 Andy Murray showed vigorous struggle in the second set
 uske baad unpar thakaan baari hone lagi or tisare or chauthe set main vah jokovich ke tufaan ko nahin tham paae
 Djokovic had made new history after three hours and 40 minutes of play
 vah lagaataar teen baar australian open jeetne vaale pehle tennis khilaadi ban gaye hai
 Although this time he did not have to come before Nadal and Federer, but this does not reduce his success
 jokovich aaj jahaan pahunche hai uski pehali dhamak unhone 2008 main mahaj 20 saal kii umr main australian open jitkar dikhaai thi
 He then defeated Roger Federer in the semi-finals
 in paanch saalon main vah iske baad mahaj paanch grand slam hi jeet paae hai
 Djokovic has won the Australian Open four times in a total of six Grand Slams and has won the Wimbledon and US Open titles once
 yah bataata he ki nadal or jokovich ke saamne unhen lagaataar sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he
 And Djokovic is doing this struggle a lot
 2011 main unhone teen grand slam khitaab jite to 2012 main mahaj ek grand slam
 In the two Grand Slams, they lost in the final
 aise main 2013 main jokovich ne shuruyaat to shandaar kii he
 The 25-year-old Djokovic has more speed and fitness than Federer and Nadal
 lihaaja aane vaale samay main unke kamyaabi kaa graph aage hi badhanaa he
 Djokovic, who rocked the world of tennis today, intended to become a football player at one time
 footbal ke alaava skiing se bhi kaaphi lagaav tha
 The father was a footballer who later became a skier
 baad main vah ek restaurant chalaane lage
 Nobody had ever played tennis at home, but Djokovic's luck was such that three-three tennis courts were built in front of his house
 chaar saal kii umr main pehali baar jokovich kaa aakarshan tennis se hua

 It is also difficult to find answers to their backhand shots
 khaskar jab vah apane donon haathon se bacand shats khelte hai to gend kii disha badal jaati he or isse saamne vaala khilaadi anchabhit rah jaataa he
 Andre Agassi has given a new name to his shots- Money Shots
 aagaasi ke mutabik is shats se hameshaa point jeeta ja saktaa he
 Agassi predicted Djokovic to win in the Australian Open final against Andy Murray
 jokovich unke bharose par ekadam khare utre
 Djokovic would also like to make up for the past year this year
 haalanki farvari main nadal vaapasi karne vaale hai federr bhi jane kaa naam nahin le rahe hai or mare bhi lagaataar acha kar rahe hai
 But Djokovic seems to be at the forefront of all this
 aane vaale dinon main unke jalwe main koi kami nahin hone vaali he
 When Andy Murray held Novak Djokovic in the first set of the final match played at the Rod Laver Arena of the Australian Open, there was a doubt in my mind whether Murray would make history here
 mare ne jis tarah se semifinal main federr ko haraaya tha use dekhte hue is ashanka ke sach hone kii sambhaavna bhi thi
 However, Novak Djokovic knew that if this match is prolonged, then only he has the benefit
 endi mare ne duusare set main joardaar sangharsh dikhaaya
 He was then exhausted and could not hold Djokovic's storm in the third and fourth sets
 teen ghante or 40 minute ke khel ke baad jokovich nayaa itihaas bana chuke the
 He has become the first tennis player to win the Australian Open three times in a row
 haalanki is baar unhen nadal or federr ke saamne nahin aana padaa lekin isse unki kamyaabi kaa str kam nahin ho jaataa
 He showed his first threat to Djokovic today, winning the Australian Open at the age of 20 in 2008
 tab unhone semifinal main roger federr ko haraaya tha
 In these five years, he has won only five Grand Slams after this
 kul chah grand slam main jokovich ne chaar baar australian open jeeta he or ek−ek baar vibanladan or america open kaa khitaab unke naam rahaa he
 This suggests that they have to constantly struggle in front of Nadal and Djokovic
 or jokovich yah sangharsh khub kar rahe hai
 He won three Grand Slam titles in 2011 and just one Grand Slam in 2012
 do grand slam main unhen final main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In such a situation, Djokovic has started in 2013
 25 saal ke jokovich ke paas federr or nadal ke mukaable kahin zyada teji he or fitness bhi
 Therefore, the graph of their success has to move forward in the coming time
 aaj tennis kii duniya main dhamal machaane vaale jokovich kaa iraadaa ek samay footbal khilaadi banane kaa tha
 Apart from football, there was also a lot of attachment to skiing

 ghar ke pados main bane tennis court kii dashark ddeergha se talleenta se match dekhte hue unki mulaakaat yugoslavian tennis lijend jelina jenic se ho gai
 Djokovic was just six years old then

 The comments rafoyal nadal or roger federer ke bich main unhone na keval apni pukhta jagah banaai balki number van khiladi bhi ban gaye
 Djokovic is a more aggressive player than both Federer and Nadal
 besaline par unke jaisaa akramak khilaadi philhal yuva peedi main najar nahin aa rahaa
 His ground strokes played on both sides give rise to bluster
 unke bacand shats kaa jawaab talashna bhi khaasaa mushkil he
 Especially when he plays backhand shots with both his hands, the direction of the ball changes and the player in front is shocked
 andre aagaasi ne unke is shats kaa nayaa naam hi de diya he− mani shats
 According to Agassi, points can always be won by these shots
 endi mare ke khilaaf australian open final main aagaasi ne jokovich ke hi jeetne kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 Djokovic lived up to their trust
 jokovich is saal beete saal kii bharpai bhi karnaa chahenge
 Although Nadal is about to return in February, Federer is not even taking his name and Murray is also doing well
 lekin in sab main jokovich sabase aage najar aa rahe hai
 In the coming days, there will be no reduction in their speed
 teen ghante or 40 minute ke khel ke baad jokovich nayaa itihaas bana chuke the

 In the political battle of the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, the Congress' intentions, who are putting full emphasis on returning to power, are weakening their own leaders
 beete 24 ghante main hi congress ke do netaaon ne apane bayanon se congress kii kirakiri karvaa di or bijepi ko congress kaa mazaaq udaane kaa mauka bhi de diya he
 The case is of the Indore Kirau Legislative Assembly
 yahaan vidhayak ormadhya pradesh congresske kaaryakari adhyaksh jitu patawaari kaa ek video viral ho rahaa he jisame wo bolte dikh rahe hai 'aap meraa dhyaan rakhana, aapako meri izzat rakhni he party jaae tel lene'darasal, jitu patawaari somvaar ko apane kshetra kii janata se milane pahunche
 Here Patwari met the people in his assembly and was appealing to vote, but during this time his tongue slipped and he told the people that 'you have to take care of me, you have to respect me party to get oil'
 # watchcongress MLA from Indore's rau,jitu Patwari during door-to door campaigning in Indore, says, "aapko meri izzat rakhni hai, Party gayi tel lene

 com / ziodfldwey — ANI (@ANI) October 23, 2018 This video was posted on Facebook by Jeetu himself, but he removed it from his Facebook page as soon as the video went viral, but now the video is going viral on social media
 video viral hote hi bijepi ko congress par hamalaa karne kaa ek or mauka mil gaya or usne isapar pratikriya dene main der nahin kii
 BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya taunted that "till now it seemed Kamal Nath's Congress, Scindia's Congress, Digvijay's Congress"
 aaj pataa chalaa jitu patawaari kii bhi congress he
 "however, the Congress defended Jitu Patwari, saying that he used those words for BJP and not for Congress
 congress pravaktaa shobhaa ojha ne kaha ki ''jitu patawaari jis vyakti se baat karte video main dikh rahe hai wo bijepi samarthak kaa ghar he or isliye jitu use uski party yani bijepi ke liye un shabdon kaa istemaal kar rahe the naa ki congress ke liye
 Not only Jeetu Patwari, Kalpana Parulekar, a former Congress MLA, not only filed a claim from Mahidpur Assembly but also attacked former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh, and held him responsible for the Congress position
 is dauraan unka bhi video ban gaya jo viral hua
 The Congress spokesperson took her to a separate room, barring her from talking, but Kalpana Parulekar bounced again when she came out of the room and attacked Digvijay Singh fiercely
 parulekar ne kaha ki puraa madhyapradesh jaanata he ki digvijay ke bolne se bantaadhaar hi hota he
 The Congress has considered Kalpana's video as serious and has spoken of complaining to the high command
 congress yun to naaraa detii he ''vaqt he badlaav kaa'' lekin lagata nahi kii congress netaa badalane ko taiyaar he kyonki is tarah ke bayaan congress ko kisi bhi tarah se phayda pahunchaate nahin dikhte
 The Winter Session of Parliament came to an end and neither the GST Bill was passed, which had so many decorations and no other law could be made
 jo kanoon atake unamem bhrashtachar rokane vaala kanoon bhi shaamil he
 On the other hand, the political furore between the ruling BJP and the opposition has increased so much that the brotherhood of the early days has been completely forgotten
 neshnal herald maamle main sonia or rahul gandhi ko adaalat main pesh kiye jane ke aadesh ke baad congress netaa pehle hi aasmaan sir par uthaae hai
 The confrontation between the BJP and the Congress over the Herald case did not end with the scuffle between the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party over the CBI investigation against Rajendra Kumar, a close assistant and principal secretary of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 aisa lagata he ki kumaar ke khilaaf maamla itnaa bada or gambhir he ki sibiai ne protocol kaa bhi paalan nahin kiya
 The protocol is that the person above whom the raid is being conducted, has to give this information to the officer directly above it
 is maamle main mukhyamantri hi vah adhikari the
 Instead of doing so, the CBI teams came to the Delhi Secretariat at 9 am on December 16 and directly sealed Kumar's office
 sibiai ke mutabik chaape main abhi tak duusari chizon ke alaava acchhee-khaasi taadaad main nakadi nikali he
 According to the CBI, a strong case of corruption is made against Kumar
 gusse se agbabula kejariwal ke mutabik pradhanmantri “kaayar or manorogi” hai or unka aarope he ki sibiai ko chaape kaa farmaan sidhe modi se mila tha
 Not only this, he also said that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has rigged the running of Delhi District Cricket Association
 is dhaandhlee kii filein dekhne hi sibiai ai thi
 These files are missing from the office and the Chief Minister is planning to set up a commission to investigate the matter
 kuch reporton ke mutabik dilli ke mukhyamantri ko aisi koi jaanch baitaane kaa adhikaar hi nahin he
 According to Arun Jaitley, these allegations are nonsense and the CBI is completely free to do its job
 kabhi kejariwal ke najdiki sahyogi rahe yogendra yadav ke mutabik “donon hi aarope sahi hai
 "he says," BJP is guilty of retaliation and AAP government's slapstick
 kya ve meharbaani karke logon ko bakhshakar rajkaaj par dhyaan de sakate hai?” is lagaataar tikhe hote siyaasi jhagade main koi shame-lihaaj baaki nahin rah gaya he
 In the early days of the winter session of Parliament, after the defeat in Bihar, the Prime Minister was seen to be extending the hand of friendship to the opposition
 yahaan tak ki ashishnutaa par sansad main hui bahes ke dauraan ve or unki party ke netaa vipaksh kii jhidakiyon ko khamoshi se sunate rahe
 But slowly, he began to take charge, especially at a time when the Congress refused to respond to the government's proposals on the GST and in fact raised its opposition to the height in the National Herald case
 ab kejariwal ke kareebi sahyogi ke daftar par sibiai ke chhaapon ke saath hi rajnatik tabakon main aam dharna yah he ki bijepi ko mahaj itani kamyaabi mili he ki usne vipaksh ke un dhadon ko bhi ekajute kar diya he jo har maamle main ek duusare se aankh nahin mila sakate
 For example, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee supported Kejriwal's claim that the BJP was behind the raids against Kumar
 rajya main 2016 ke madhya main hone vaale vidhansabha ke chunaavon main mamata kaa mukhya muqabla bijepi se hi he
 Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (united) also supported that Kejriwal was the target
 aap kii kattar dushman congress party ne bhi sansad satr ke dauraan kumaar par chaape daalane ke bijepi ke faisle kii aalochana kii
 The timing of the raids cannot be said to be very favorable in political terms, which is why Lutyens' issue in Delhi is hotly contested
 aisa nahin he ki kumaar ke bare main sawaal nahin uth rahe hai
 In early 2013, during the 49-day government of Kejriwal, an MLA in the presence of several people seems to have told him that his decision to make Kumar his principal secretary was a grave mistake
 us vidhayak ne shiksha or ity vibhaag main kumaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan tathakthith “bhrashtachar ke sabooton” kaa hawala bhi diya tha
 But Kejriwal refuted the allegations
 kejariwal ke ek puraane sahyogi rajkaaj kii keemat par baari-bharkam tamaasha khadaa karne ke unke ravaiye ko yaad karte hai
 These allies believe that Kejriwal does not have the brains of discipline or principles necessary for the rule of a big and complicated city like Delhi
 yahi vajah he ki jab dilli kii ek gaiyrkanoonee jhuggi basti ko railway ne saaf karavaaya or usamen ek bacchee kii maut ho gai, to kejariwal ghanghor laaparvaahee kaa aarope lagaate hue us par tut pade
 Until it was completely clear that the girl was dead before the cleanliness drive started
 isi tarah, aap ke vidhayak jitendra tomars or unki “farji digriyon” ke maamle main tomars kii kisi bhi aalochana ke khilaaf kejariwal ke tyoriyaan chadha lene kii koi had hi nahin thi, lekin aakhir main unhen maananaa padaa ki unke purv saathi galat the
 Critics of Kejriwal also believe that the Chief Minister of Delhi will somehow keep himself in the glare till the general elections in 2019, in which he wants to stand himself in the main contest of Modi
 ye aalochak yah bhi kehete hai ki kejariwal is baat se khaas khush nahin hai ki nitish kumaar ne bihar main apni haisiyat ko kaayam rakhkar unhen is sthiti se bedakhal kar diya he
 Kejriwal's advocates insist that the Prime Minister disapprove of the Chief Minister of Delhi since he reached Ahmedabad in 2014
 unhone gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukchaymantri narendra modi ke daftar kii taraf jane vaali sadak kaa gheraav kiya tha or rajya main unke gairbarabari vaale vikaas par sawaal khadaa karke unhen pareshaan kiya tha
 That tension was confirmed in the May 2014 election in Varanasi and continued in the Delhi elections in early 2015, in which Modi and Kejriwal had a direct contest
 siyasatdanon kaa kahana he ki sibiai chaape modi-kejariwal kii puraani jang kii nai baangi bhar hai
 As far as Modi is concerned, a lot of people believe (and AAP leader Ashutosh said that importance in politics is what people believe) that Modi's permission was sought before executing the raid
 isi ke saath bijepi or vipaksh ke bich tanaav achaanak bahut tikhaa ho uthaa he
 Like the monsoon session of Parliament, the winter session will end without passing any bill
 is katutaa ke 2016 main pashchim bengal, assam or tamilnadu kii rajya vidhansabhaon ke chunaav abhiyaanon ke dauraan or phir 2017 main punjab or uttar pradesh ke abhiyaanon ke dauraan bhi or zyada ugr or tikhe hone kii hi sambhaavna he
 Sharafat's language has already been a political gift for some time, but raids on Rajendra Kumar have taken him to a new pit
 kejariwal ne pradhanmantri ko “manorogi” qaraar diya, to arun jetali ne jor dekar kaha ki ve “bakawaas” par kuch kehane ke liye itnaa neeche nahin girenge, jiske jawaab main phir kejariwal ne kaha ki ve “jhooth bol rahe” hai
 In Kerala, Modi said in a rally that the Congress is on the path of destruction, destruction and destruction, therefore stalling Parliament
 jab siyasat itani kadavaahat ke saath banty ho, tab sansad ke ladaai-jhagadon kaa akhaada bane rahane kii hi sambhaavna zyada he
 Political pundits are surprised that in such a situation, the government should not be forced to rule on the basis of dictates and ordinances instead of Kaifiyat, Parivartan, man-manwaval and Sarvanumati
 kumaar kaa to jo hona he hoga, magar hakeekat yah he ki unke maamle ne siyaasi jamaat kii ek duusare se baat karne kii kaabiliyat main gahari daraaren ujagar kar di hai
 The focus of the dispute was the cause of the dispute between the man Arvind Kejriwal and the central government
 Banarajendra Kumar Date of birth December 16, 1966 IAS officer of the 1989 batch of AGMUT cadre IIT Delhi alumnus of Electrical Engineering In February 2015, he was appointed Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal
 In Kejriwal's first term as Chief Minister in 2014 His secretary as well as worked Thaseela Dixit his previous postings chairman of Delhi Transco limited-cum-managing Director, Delhi Traffic Authority secretary-cum-commissioner, Secretary (health), Commissioner (business tax)
 unhen 2007 main lok prashasan main utkrushtataa ke liye pradhanmantri ke award se nawaja gayakumar ko kejariwal ke bhrashtachar virdohi abhiyaan ke dinon se hi unka najadik mana jaataa rahaa hearoparope he ki unhone companiyaan banaain or unhen tender ke bagaiyr sarkari theke dilwaaye
 According to the complaint against him, due to this the Delhi government had to suffer financial losses
 sibiai ne unke khilaaf aapraadhik sajeesh or kadacharan kaa mukadmaa darj kiya he
 The anti-corruption Branch of the Delhi Government paid him 100 crores
 ke sienji fitness ghotaale main unki kathith bhoomika ke liye poochtacha kii thi
 The AAP government has accused former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung of playing a role in the scam

 After the airstrikes on terrorist targets in Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity and people's level of satisfaction with his government has seen a tremendous increase, while Congress President Rahul Gandhi's rating chart has fallen

 He said, "after the budget, we saw a slight increase in the net approval rating
 isliye is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ja saktaa he ki bajet se rajg ke liye paryaapt samarthan nahin mila
 It saw a decisive increase in the trend after the Pulwama attack and a tremendous increase after the Balakot air strike
 "pradhanmantri kii apruval reating pulavama hawaii hamale ke saath badi he
 On the other hand, Congress President Rahul Gandhi started the year with an approval rating of 23 percent
 lekin pulavama or balakot hawaii hamale ke baad unki apruval reating girakar 8 pratishat rah gai he
 The possibility of changing the ratings after the election campaign starts cannot be ruled out

 He added, "the Supreme Court bench has declared 3 divorces to be illegal for 6 months
 or isaki dedline 22 farvari, 2018 tak he
 We have introduced this bill to make this moratorium permanent
 "sadan main vipaksh ke netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha, "bill ko select kamity ko bheja jaae yaa nahin, is par ham matdaan chaahate hai, jabaki sattadhari sadsy is par raji nahin hai
 The BJP does not have a majority in the upper house

 The Ranthambore Tiger Reserve was seen in silence everywhere
 junglee jaanwaron se lekar vanadhikariyon or vanyajeev premiyon kii ankhen nam thim
 Because the tigress named 'fish', known as the world's tiger, named Quinn of Ranthambore, which populated the finished tiger reserve of Sariska, including Ranthambore National Park, passed away from this world after a long illness
 is baghin ko mili kai awordstiger queen ke naam se jane jaani vaali ranthambhore kii yah baghin machhlee pichley kai dinon se bimaari se jujh rahi thi or ranthambhore se sate ek hotel parisar main deraa daale hue thi

 Which nobody else has found in the wild life

 She was given a guard of honor in the presence of wildlife lovers, including forest officers of the forest department
 puure sammaan ke saath ranthambhore ke aama ghati kshetra main uskaa dah sanskaar kiya gaya
 The tigress 'fish' was 20 years old, the tigress T16, which has been maintaining its rule for many years in the Ranthambore Tiger National Park, was around 20 years old, which is a unique example in the wildlife itself
 ranthambhore sahit sariska ko aabaad karane vaali yah baghin 20 varsh kii umr hone vajah se durbal ho chuki thi
 His body parts also stopped working

 jise dekhte hue chikitsako dwaara use maance main davaaiyaan daalkar dene kaa prayaas bhi kiya gaya tha
 CC TV cameras were installed to monitor the tigress
 saath hi van vibhaag dwaara staff tainaat kiya gaya tha
 All the people associated with Ranthambore for the life of the fish also prayed for him, but none of his prayers worked
 machhlee kii haalat behad kharaab hoti chali gai
 Yogesh Kumar Sahu, Chief Conservator of Namaranathambhore, with the eyes of the forest officials, told moist eyes that the fish was found near the pond as soon as it entered the park
 itani khubasurat tigres shaayad kabhi is neshnal park ko nahin mil paae
 District Collector Kailash Chand Verma himself came to give a guard of honor to the fish
 inkaa kahana he ki jo koi tourist aata tha machhlee ke bare main puche yaa use dekhe bina nahin jaataa tha
 Had there been no fish, Ranthambore would not have been so inhabited, nor would Sariska reside
 is baghin par baniin kai filmenmachhlee 1997-98 main pehali baar ranthambhore main ek shaavak ke rup main apni maa ke saath najar ai thi
 These three sisters were T14, T15 and this was T16

 Tiger is said to carry the Quinn of Ranthambore
 isane ranthambhore hi nahin balki sariska ko aabaad karne main mahatvapurn yogadan diya tha

 jiske kaaran ranthambhore sahit sariska aabaad hue
 Due to the family of this tigress, tigers have grown in Ranthambore today
 isane ranthambhore bhraman par aane vaale deshi videshi paryatakon ko apni or aakarshith kiya tha
 Many films have also been made on the tigress T16, known as Tiger Quinn of Ranthambore

 Those who have also received awards

 This tigress was the first tigress in the world to be awarded the Life Time Achievement Award
 iske chehre par the machhlee jaise nishaanis par rajya sarkaar ne dak tikat bhi jari kiya tha
 According to wildlife lovers, the contribution made by the fish in populating Ranthambore Park was very important
 isbaghinke bare main kaha jaataa he ki isane apane bacchon kii suraksha ke liye pani main magaramchh par atake kiya tha
 Due to which three of its teeth were broken
 isi vajah se yah shikaar karne main asarmath ho gai thi uske baavjood yah baghin pani va asake aas-paas ke ilaako main apane tajurbe se shikaar kar leti thi
 It was named fish because of the fish-like mark on its face
 saath hi is baghin ko ladi of lake va crocrodail killer ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa tha
 This tigress, named Fish, was the most talked about tourist visiting Ranthambore

 Demand for keeping the effigy of 'fish' in the museum, Wildlife lovers have demanded the construction of an effigy in Rajiv Gandhi Museum including its effigy in the memory of the tigress
 jis par jila colector kailash chand verma ne rajya sarkaar ko prastaav banaakar bhejne kii baat kahi he
 If the proposal is passed by the state government, the effigy of Ranthambore's Tiger Quinn will be installed in the Rajiv Gandhi Museum so that tourists visiting Ranthambore can see the effigy of the tigress even after the death of the tigress
 tiger queen ke naam se prasiddh ranthambhore kii yah maharani apni antim saans lene ke saath hi wild life ke itihaas main sadaa ke liye amar ho gai
