 aaie yahaan chandrashekhar aaazaad se judi kuch baaten jaane jo shaayad aapako na pataa hon
 The path of revolution chosen from the age of 14, Chandrasekhar Azad was born on this day i
e
 23 July 1906
 unka janm sthaan madhya pradesh ke alirajpur jile kaa bhabra main hua tha
 In 1920, at the age of 14, Chandrasekhar Azad was associated with the non-cooperation movement of Gandhiji

 His fame was slowly growing
 bachapan se nishanebaaj the ajaadchandrashekhar aaazaad kii nishanebaaji bachapan se bahut acchhee thi

 Chandrasekhar Azad avenged the death of Lala Lajpat Rai in 1928 by shooting down the British police offer SP Saunders in Lahore
 aaazaad ramprasad bismil ke krantikari sanghathan hindustan republic association (echaare) se judane ke baad unki jindagi badal gai
 He started raising funds for the revolutionary activities of the organization by looting the treasury
 unka maananaa tha ki yah dhan bharatiyon kaa hi he jise angrejon ne lutaa he
 Azad took an active part in the Kakori Kand (1925) under the leadership of Ramprasad Bismil
 aaazaad hai, aaazaad rahengechandrashekhar aaazaad kehete the ki 'dushman kii goliyon kaa, ham saamana karenge, aaazaad hi rahe hai, aaazaad hi rahenge' unke is naare ko ek vakt tha ki har yuva roj doharaata tha
 The pride with which he spoke, thousands of young people would be ready to kill him
 
 
 
 And finally Chandra Shekhar Azad was planning with Alfred Park in Allahabad with Sukhdev and another of his friends
 achaanak angrej police ne unpar hamalaa kar diya
 Azad opened fire on the police so that his partner Sukhdev could escape

 aakhir main unhene apana naaraa aaazaad he aaazaad rahenge arthath na kabhi pakade jaaenge or na british sarkaar unhen faansee de sakegi ko yaad kiya
 In this way he killed the last shot of the pistol himself and sacrificed his life for the motherland
 vaise is tathy ko lekar kai vivaad bhi saamne aate hai, jisaki abhi tak pushti nahin ho saki he

 But the BJP is yet to decide its candidates in 2 of the four seats in Bundelkhand
 tikat main liye jod-tod main shaamil netaa dilli main deraa jamaaye baithe hai
 Almost all the mlas of Jhansi and Lalitpur districts are busy reaching Delhi to ensure their claim
 uma bharti ke manaa karne ke baad jhaansi seat par pratyaashee kii talash itani mushkil hogi iskaa andaaza shaayad hi kisi ko rahaa hoga
 The organization has been sweating in candidate selection in both the seats
 jhaansi main ek din pehle hi pradesh adhyaksh mahendra nath pandey ne kaha tha ki jhaansi loksabhaa ke pratyaashee ke naam kaa elaan somvaar ko ho jayega
 Now that the day of Monday has changed and the nomination process is going to start from tomorrow, everyone's eyes are on who will be the candidate
 mana ja rahaa he ki bhaajapa or aresas kii ore se vaidyanath ayurveda ke chairman anuraag sharma kaa naam pratyaashee ke rup main surkhiyon main aayaa tha
 It was told that soon after the name of Anurag, Jhansi Sadar MLA Ravi Sharma, Babina MLA Rajiv Singh, Lalitpur MLA Ramratan Kushwaha had objected to it
 iske saath hi lodh pratyaashee ke rup main ganga charan rajput ke naam kaa bhi bahari pratyaashee ke rup main virodh shuru hi gaya
 The candidate's decision was hanged amid this protest
 bundelkhand kii chaar siton par abhi banda se brahman, hamirpur se thakur, jhaansi se lodh pichhadaa or jalon se anusuchit jati kaa pratyaashee tha
 This time also BJP has retained the ticket of Pushpendra Singh Chandel from Hamirpur and Bhanu Pratap Verma from Jalaun
 ab yadi banda se kisi brahman kii tikat mil to jhaansi main lodh yaa pichhadaa varg ko bhaajapa tikat de sakati he
 Bhairo Prasad Mishra from Banda is finding it difficult to get a ticket again
 yahaan malini avasthi ke naam kii bhi charchaa he to pichhadaa varg main aar
 K
 patel ko tikat die jane kii charchaaen bhi kii ja raheen hai
 While the Jhansi seat has not been decided even after a rashumari from Uma Bharti
 jhaansi se brahman pratyaashiyon main vidhayak ravi sharma or vaidyanath ke chairman anuraag sharma, lodh pratyaashiyon main ganga charan rajput or vidhayak jawahar rajput, kushvaha pratyaashee main vidhayak ramratan kushvaha ke naam pramukh rup se charchaa main rahe hai
 It is believed that Anurag Sharma's name was about to be announced, only after the objections of the legislators, Uma Bharti stopped it
 baad main uma bharti kii pasand ke pratyaashee ganga charan kaa bhi bahari ke naam par virodh ho gaya
 In this politics, the organization has stopped the announcement of candidates for Jhansi and Banda seats
 kyonki jhaansi seat par lodh samaaj nirnaayak sthiti main he isliye sanghathan uma bharti ko bina vishwaas main liye pratyaashee kii ghoshnaa nahin karnaa chahta he
 At present, Uma Bharti is not meeting any ticket contenders directly
 aise main yah kah paanaa bhi mushkil he ki uma kaa haath kiske sir par hoga
 Or the organization will announce the candidate based on its internal survey
 *** All the senior police officers associated with the security of the country are practicing Yoga nowadays
 fit rahane ke liye nahin balki dijipi conference main karne ke liye
 The conference, organized by the IB, is being held at the National Police Academy in Hyderabad this year from November 25-27, but this year there are changes in some rugs
 pichley saal jahaan sabane milakar surya namaskara or chakrasana kiya tha is saal jor shav aasaan or bal aasaan par he
 The simple logic behind this is that the Prime Minister will take part in this meeting only one day this year i
e
 will reach Hyderabad on November 25 evening and will leave from there on the second afternoon i
e
 November 26
 yani teen din chalane vaali conference main ek din hi wo yoga main hissaa lenge
 There is a lot of enthusiasm among all the officers about this matter
 pichley saal ye conference dhordo (bhuj) main hui thi or pradhanmantri ne do din khud subah chah baje uthakar khud to yoga kiya tha
 At the same time, all the officers of the whole country had got him worshiped
 lekin is baar khud pradhanmantri kaa pakkaa nahin he ki wo yoga seshan main hissaa lenge yaa nahin isiilie sabhi afasar is saal zyaada fokas shav aasaan or bal aasaan kii practice par kar rahe hai
 The comments "main shav aasaan bahut acha karata hoon," ek varisht adhikari ne enditivi se muskuraate hue kaha to ek police afasar ke mutabiq aise yoga satr main sirf saans lene kii kriyaaon par fokas hona chahie
 After all, police officers live stressful lives
 anulom-vilom jaise he kapaalbhaati jaise yoga asana par fokas hona chahie
 "I like to do the reverse - because it keeps the whole body healthy," he argues
 vaise pradhanmantri karyaalay kaa kahana he kii pradhanmantri is saal ek din hi is baithak main isiilie hissaa le rahe hai kyonki desh main jo notebandi ko lekar hallaa much rahaa he us par wo zyaada dhyaan de rahe he
 The simple logic behind this is that the Prime Minister will take part in this meeting only one day this year i
e
 will reach Hyderabad on November 25 evening and will leave from there on the second afternoon i

 There is a lot of enthusiasm among all the officers about this matter
 pichley saal ye conference dhordo (bhuj) main hui thi or pradhanmantri ne do din khud subah chah baje uthakar khud to yoga kiya tha
 At the same time, all the officers of the whole country had got him worshiped
 lekin is baar khud pradhanmantri kaa pakkaa nahin he ki wo yoga seshan main hissaa lenge yaa nahin isiilie sabhi afasar is saal zyaada fokas shav aasaan or bal aasaan kii practice par kar rahe hai
 The comments "main shav aasaan bahut acha karata hoon," ek varisht adhikari ne enditivi se muskuraate hue kaha to ek police afasar ke mutabiq aise yoga satr main sirf saans lene kii kriyaaon par fokas hona chahie

 Last year, this conference took place in Dhordo (bhuj) and the Prime Minister himself got up at six in the morning for two days and did yoga himself
 saath hi puure desh ke sabhi afasaron ko dandavat namaskara karwaae the
 But this time the Prime Minister himself is not sure whether he will participate in the Yoga session or not, so all the officers are focusing more on the practice of easy dead bodies and easy hair
 tippaniyan "I do a dead body very well," said a senior officer smiling to NDTV, so according to a police officer, the focus should be on breathing activities in such a yoga session
 akhir police afasar tanavbhari zindagi jo jite he
 There should be focus on yoga asanas like anulom-antonyms like Kapalabhati
 "mujhe khud anulom-vilom karnaa pasand he kyunki usase puraa sharir tandoorast rahata he," unka tark he
 By the way, the Prime Minister's Office says that the Prime Minister is taking part in this meeting on this day only because he is paying more attention to the demonetisation in the country

 He is one title behind the Czech Republic player Ivan Lendl, while the US is 14 titles behind the legendary Jimmy Connors
 iske alaava roger federer ne agle saptaah se shuru ho rahe rolex paris masters toornament se apana naam waapas le liya he
 According to the announcement made by the tournament organizers, Federer made the decision due to a back injury
 ieenes ke mutabik, paris masters ke aayojakon ne apane ek twit main kaha, ‘federer ne peeth kii chot ke kaaran toornament se apana naam waapas le liya he
 ' raajnneeti hameshaa se sambhaavnaaon kii kala rahi he; bihar ke kuch saansadon ne is kahawat ke arth ko apratyaashit dhang se vyapak kar diya he
 When it comes to Lok Sabha membership and privileges and perks, they are in the party, against all other occasions
 haal main janata dal united (jad-you) ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav ne aise sabhi saansadon ko ''duusari party ke liye chunaav prachaar se pehle party se istipha dene'' ke liye kah diya
 But RJD chief Lalu Prasad, the victim of this trend, thought it better not to say anything more about this, given the possibility of going waste
 darasal jad-you saansad rajeev ranjan urf lalan singh bihar vidhansabha chunaav se pehle khulkar congress kaa prachaar kar rahe hai
 He is clearly the leader of this trend
 ve 2009 main munger se jad-you ke tikat par loksabhaa ke liye nirvaachit hue
 Former JD-U state president Lalan Singh resigned from his post in February this year but did not leave the party
 uske baad se is 55 varshiya saansad ne vipaksh ke netaa kii bhoomika nibhaane main jhijak mahasoos nahin kii
 He considered it good to remain a JD-U MP by not leaving the party membership or joining any other party
 unhone matdaan ke dauraan party vip kaa bhi ulanghan nahin kiya
 If they had done so, they could be disqualified on the basis of defection according to the Tenth Schedule
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke dost se dushman bane lalan singh chaahate hai ki unhen jad-you se nishkasit kar diya jaae taaki ve swatantra ho jaaen
 Though he has embarrassed the party by backing the Congress and calling a personal attack on Nitish, JD-U is reluctant to expel him
 vah is vajah se ki agar party ne unhen nikaal diya to ve nirdaleey ke rup main saansad bane rahenge
 If he resigns, he will not remain MP
 rajd pramukh lalu prasad bhi apane saansad umashankar singh kii vajah se aisi hi paristhitiyon se jujh rahe hai
 Umashankar Singh, a 70-year-old MP from Maharajganj, has been openly defaming Lalu ever since his arch rival Prabhunath Singh was included in the RJD
 umashankar ne bhi party kii sadsyta chode bina rajd sansadeey board se istipha de diya
 They are also campaigning against RJD candidates
 inke alaava, bihar ke do or loksabhaa saansad apane party netritv ke khilaaf sangharsh kar rahe hai
 These mps have exposed the boundaries of the anti-defection law without leaving the party
 yah kanoon 1985 main 52wein sanshodhan ke rup main lagu kiya gaya
 The need to remove the loopholes of this law was already felt, but due to these flaws, the mps of Bihar have got the opportunity to blow the plate and pierce it
 misaal ke taur par, is kanoon main kuch sadasyon kii ''nirdaleey'' ke rup main pahchaan kii vyavastha nahin he, lekin isamen party se nishkasit sadasyon ko ayogy tehraane kii bhi vyavastha nahin he
 In the fifteenth Lok Sabha, Trinamool Congress MP Kabir Suman started cursing the leadership without leaving the party membership
 lekin vidhansabha chunaav se ain pehle baagi saansadon kii sankhya ko dekhte hue bihar kaa maamla adhyayan kaa vishay ho saktaa he ki janpratinidhi kaise apni party ke saath gaddari kar sakate hai
 JD-U mps - Jayanarayana Nishad (muzaffarpur) and Poornamasi Ram (gopalganj) - arranged a Congress ticket for their families but Nishad's daughter-in-law returned the Congress ticket
 nishad ne kaha, ''jad-you ke saath koi samajhaita nahin hua he
 Mary b has decided not to contest elections, so she is not contesting
 vaise main puri tarah jad-you ke saath hum
 Purnamasi Ram was also shocked when the Congress withdrew his son Vijay Ram after giving him his election symbol
 ram ne kaha, ''vijay ne congress pratyaashee ke rup main pehle hi apana namakan daakhil kar diya he, agar uskaa namakan radd hua to main kisi or pratyaashee kaa samarthan karuunga
 "obviously, Ram will campaign against the authorized JD-U candidate
 in maamalon ne sanvaidhanik or rajnatik, donon tarah ke sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Apart from Lalan Singh and Umashankar Singh, who like Lok Sabha membership but the party's leader Nagwar passes away, the rest of the mps' attitude is against the party because their families wanted to contest elections and have jumped into the fray
 is rujhaan ko badhaane main rajg, congress yaa lojpa-rajd gathbandhan kaa bhi yogadan kam nahin he
 He wooed the kin of political rivals and gave them tickets
 spasht rup se is rujhaan ko bihar kii partiyon ne hi shuru kiya or vahi isaki labhaarthi hongi
 Two RJD mps - Jagadanand Singh and Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, whose family members have been given tickets by rival parties - are supporting Lalu Prasad
 bhaajapa ne jagadanand singh ke bete sudhakar singh ko jabaki congress ne raghuvansh prasad singh ke chachere bhai raghupati singh ko mahanaar seat se khadaa kiya he
 There is a difference in the pre-election attitude of the two mps
 jagadanand singh apni party ke paksh main kaam kar rahe hai to raghuvansh prasad singh ne lalu prasad ke congress se rishte todane kii aalochana kii he
 Questioning the decision to give 75 seats to the LJP, he termed the Congress's decision to leave the party as "the biggest mistake"
 sanyogvash, rajd ne mahanaar seat lojpa ke liye chhod di thi

 rashtriya jaanch agency (NIA) ne guuruuvaar ko bihar ke kai shaharon main chhapemari kii
 In the meantime a weapon has been recovered from Santosh Pandey's house in 
 jise eke-47 bataaya ja rahaa he
 Santosh Pandey is the brother of former MLA Sunil Pandey and former MLC Hulas Pandey
 haalanki enie ne abhi tak baraamad hathiyaar eke-47 hone kii pushti nahin kii he
 The search operation of the NIA team is still going on in Bihar
 bihar main AK-47 baraamad hone kii ye koi pehali ghatana nahin he, balki bihar kaa munger jila avaidh hathiyaaron kaa ek bada centre ban gaya he
 When 20 ak-47s were stirred up earlier, in October last year, 20 AK47 rifles were recovered during one such search operation in Munger district of Bihar
 police ne search oparation ke dauraan ganga nadi main milane vaale naalon ko bhi khangala tha
 In fact, all these exercises were started in the state after the use of AK 47 in many incidents
 is puure maamle main tab tak kul 18 logon kii giraftaar kii gai thi
 Explain that a large number of spare parts of AK 47 were seized from Munger district of Bihar
 jo police ne nadiyon or kuon se baraamad kiye the
 The search operation was conducted for a fortnight after the arms smuggling racket was uncovered 3 years ago in the state
 usee ke tahat police ko 20 eke47 or uske 500 parts baraamad hue the
 Major search operation in Munger Police conducted search operation in many parts of Munger district
 kyonki munger jila pichley kai dashakon se ucch gunvattta vaale unnat hathiyaar or gola barood ke gaiyrkanoonee nirmaan ke liye kukhyat he
 There were 281 spare parts of AK 47 recovered from the banks of the Ganges
 oparation eke47 ke tahat jab police ne mafasil police stesan ke manzaar wardha gaanv main ek ghar par chapa maaraa tha, to vahaan se police ko eke47 rifl ke 91 spair parts baraamad hue the
 It is also surprising that members of the house fled from there even before the police raid
 kahin kuen main to kahin zamin main dabi thi eke47munger ke police ke mutabik us ek pakhwaade main pehle ek aamanaa khatun naamak mahila ko giraftaar kiya tha
 He revealed during interrogation that the spare parts of AK 47 were hidden in a well in the village
 iske baad police ne vahaan chapa markar spair parts baraamad kar liye the
 It is noteworthy that when the police raided Aamna's house
 to vahaan ghar ke farsh main dabaai gai do eke47 baraamad kii thi
 Which were ready to be used
 police ne bataaya ki spair parts kii baramadagi se saaf sanket milte hai ki hathiyaaron ke taskari karne vaale maang ke hisaab se eke47 banaate hai
 After the disclosure of this racket by the Tarahathiyars who were attached to the Jabalpur OD depot, it was found that some of the recovered AK 47 rifles were produced at the Central OD depot in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh
 vahaan se unhen maovadiyon or aatankwaadiyon tak pahunchane ke liye taskari kar bihar pahunchaaya gaya tha
 The revelations gave the officers sleep
 aisa mana jaataa he ki saal 2012 se ab tak jabalpur aayudh depo se 60 se adhik eke47 rifl gaayab ho chuki hai
 Those who were smuggled and sent to Munger
 is sambandh main vahaan depo main armar ke pad par tainaat rahe purushottam laal ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 On which there is a charge of sending these weapons to the smugglers
 police ne is maamle main purushottam laal samet madhya pradesh se chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya tha
 In many incidents, AK 47s have been used to tell that the former mayor Sameer Kumar was roasted in the Muzaffarpur in Bihar by the former Mayor Sameer AK 47

 Earlier, in Gurugram, Haryana, police arrested 25-year-old Ram Singh alias Vijay Singh, a resident of Rampur village in Motihari district of Bihar, during a routine check of vehicles in Sector 15
 usne pichley saal sitambar main eke47 rifl se motihari main bihar police kii team par hamalaa kiya tha
 Not only this, he also killed his opponent Bablu Kumar from AK 47 in East Champaran
 aaj kal kisi baat kii jaankaree leni ho to log vikipedia kii sharan lete hai
 And if you search the Hasdev river on Wikipedia, you will find its introduction in two lines that the Hasdev river is the major tributary of Mahanadi
 yah korba ke koyala kshetra main or champa maidan main bahati he
 The Hasdeo River originates from the Kaimur hills of Koriya district and joins the Mahanadi flowing in Korba, Bilaspur districts
 isaki kul lambaai 176 kilometre he
 Just
 thodaa neeche scrol karenge to shaayad aapaki najar ek or pankti par jaaegi jisamen likhaa he ki ek survey ke anusaar hasdev nadi chhattisgarh kii sabase pradooshit nadi he
 The contributor to Wikipedia has not told which survey it was and how the river is the most polluted in Chhattisgarh, but how deep is the problem
 hamane shaayad pradooshit nadiyon or talabon ko apni niyati maan liya he
 Hasdev is one of the 21 rivers of Chhattisgarh that can be called the lifeline of the state
 apane safar main pehle 125 kimi tak to hasdev nadi bilkul saaf-suthri rahati he par uske baad korba pahunchate hi nadi kaa pani pradooshit ho jaataa he
 The reason for this is the ash water and harmful chemicals released from the dam
 hasdev nadi par hi bango baandh he, saath hi ab tak 11 anicat banaae gaye hai, jahaan se audyogic sansthaanon ko pani diya jaataa he
 At the time of construction, the dam had a water logging capacity of 3,046 million cubic meters (MCM), but due to silt filling it has now reduced to 2,894 MCM
 hasdev bango baandh kaa nirmaan 1992 main puraa hua tha
 In the last 27 years the water-logging capacity of the dam has decreased by 10 percent
 baandh main barish ke samay pani main bahakar gaad aata he
 This report is also confirmed by the Central Water Commission
 isi vajah se audyogic sansthaanon ko pani dene ke liye nirdhaarit maatra main se 23 million ghanmeter gata di gai he
 From here 418 MCM water reserve has been kept to give to the industries
 pehle udyogon ke liye 441 emsm pani rigerv rakhaa gaya tha
 1,454 MCM water reserve has been kept for Kharif irrigation
 bango baandh se darri baraj ke bich antipisi ke rakhad (fliash) baandh kaa pani nadi main aata he
 After this, the water of Belgary and Dengurnala goes down into the river from the pass barrage
 yahaan se bhi rakhyukt pani kaa pravaah hota he
 Since separation from Madhya Pradesh, industrialization in this area has intensified and various types of heavy metals have started accumulating in the Hasdev River by adopting modern methods of agriculture
 rajshri singh ne is par ek shodhpatr taiyaar kiya he or unke shodhpatr main hasdev nadi main jamaa baari dhaatuon kii maatra ke bare main vistaar se bataaya gaya he
 According to research, exposure to these heavy metals will not only affect the aquatic organisms of the river but it has also started showing its effect on people's health
 shodhpatr ke mutabik, korba main das alag-alag jagahon par pradooshkon kii jaanch kii gai
 The quantity of metals such as cadmium, copper, lead, iron, and zinc in river water is considered to be significantly higher by standards
 asal main, korba ko soobe kii urja rajdhani bhale hi kaha jaataa ho, par yahaan ke bijligharon ne hasdev nadi kii saanse rokane kaa kaam kiya he
 The thermal power plants here consume 80 thousand tons of coal daily and 40 percent of it is left as ash
 is bottm aish or flani aish ko pani main bhingokar rakhad dam main le jaaya jaataa he
 NTPC, the power generation company, Balco's Rakhdar Dame is on the banks of the ravines along the Hasdev river, causing ash to flow into the river
 isi se pani pradooshit hota he
 The seriousness of this problem can be gauged from the fact that 8 thermal power plants of Korba produce more than 1 lakh metric tons of fly ash
 haalanki, kuch taap bijli gharon main to rakhad dam bhi nahin he
 In 2009, the Central Pollution Control Board conducted a study, according to which Korba was ranked fifth in the severely polluted cluster of 88 industrial clusters in the country
 hasdev nadi kaa dam rakhyukt pani se ghutata ja rahaa he
 The electricity being built in Korba is illuminating our homes, but after the end of a river, how much darkness will spread in that area, we have no idea of it
 (manjit thakur, india today ke vishesh samvaadadaata hai)*** The Board of Secondary Education (BSE), Odisha has announced the timetable for the 10th class examination to be held in the year 2017

 rajya nirvachan ayog ne board se farvari main koi bhi pariksha yojit na karne ke liye kaha tha
 Now the board in consultation with the state government has declared the final timetable of the exam
 pariksha ke liye aplicoshan form 1 november se bhare ja sakenge

 When it comes to cabinet reshuffle, the thrill is more than the announcement of the cricket team
 jaahir he isse raajnneeti kaa nayaa khel pataa chalata he
 We knew for several weeks that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would reshuffle the cabinet immediately after the monsoon session of Parliament
 shanivaar tak sabhi ko spasht ho chukaa tha ki kise cabinet main jagah milegi or koun apni kursi ganvaa baithegaa
 Six ministers had already submitted their resignations to ease the work of the Prime Minister
 teen riktiyaan cabinet main pehle se thim- manohar parrikar, venkayya naidu or anil dave
 Hence, the arithmetic of the reshuffle was also simple: Modi had 75 members in the Cabinet before these vacancies and the Cabernet also has 75 members with nine new ministers in the expansion on Sunday
 modi cabinet ke kaarykaal main yah teesraa pherbadal he or ab is nai team par kaarykaal ke bache hue dinon kii jimmedaari he
 Although politics is not cricket
 ek acchhee cricket team test match ke paanchon din ek saath acha khelte hue match jeet sakati hai
 But despite running a good government for five years, the party sitting in opposition is more likely to win
 voter ke bartaav kaa anumaan hameshaa nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In 2009, the UPA government was undergoing corruption and coalition pulls
 lagaataar teen saal tak 9 fisadi se adhik jidipi growth ke baavjood 2008-09 main jidipi naatakeey dhang se 6
 Shrinks to 7 percent
 iske baavjood sattarudh congress 2009 chunaav main 28
 With 61 per cent of the vote share, the figure is 206, winning 61 more seats
 vahiin 2004 ke chunaavon main party ko 26
 It had won only 145 seats with a vote share of 5 per cent
 vahiin vipaksh main baithi bijepi ko 2004 main 138 seat mili lekin 2009 main mahaj 116 seat par simat gai
 Did getting more seats mean that UPA-2 was a more stable government? According to a research, 16 changes were made to the Manmohan Singh cabinet from 23 May 2009 to 16 May 2014, when Modi was declared victorious
 mantriyon kaa aana or janaa haasyaaspad bhi rahaa
 During the tenure of UPA-2, there were 7 railway ministers, so the figure of three railway ministers in Modi's three years is not so bad
 lekin, 8 saal main 10 rail mantri?ise bhi padhein: notebandi kaa kabhi samarthan nahin kiya, nuksaan ko lekar chetaya tha: rajandesh main cabinet vistaar ko badlaav ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 Is Modi really different? Now that Modi's statement of 'minimum government, maximum governance' has become clouded in the glow of New India and 4P, it is necessary to understand some of the changes in the cabinet reshuffle on Sunday
 -jin chaar rajya mantriyon ko cabinet darje ke saath pramotion diya gaya- nirmala sitaraman, piyush goyal, dharmendra pradhan or mukhtaar abbaas nakvi- sabhi rajyasabha se hai or unki apni koi raajnneetik jameen nahin he
 - It is good that four bureaucrats were made ministers but they have no experience in the workload assigned to them
 - up-raashtrapati banaae gaye venkayya naidu modi ke varishthatam mantriyon main shumaar the
 He will now be handled by the Minister of State for Housing and Urban Development
 ise bhi padhein: raghuram rajan bole- sarkaar kaa naukar nahin hota rigerv bank kaa governor- hardip singh puri videsh seva ke ek safal adhikari the
 They will now be tested on the challenges of rapid urbanization and smart cities
 - isi tarah sookshm, laghu or madhyam udhyam mantralay ko bhi cabinet mantri kii jagah rajya mantri dekhenge
 It is noteworthy that the decision of demonetisation has presented tough challenges for this ministry
 - naidu ke ek anya mantralay soochna or prasaaran (ibi) ko pehle asthai rup se smriti irani ke adheen kiya gaya tha, ab vah donon textile or ibi jaise gairasambandhit mantralayon kii kaman sanbhaalengi
 Similarly, in place of two ministers of state of finance, two other new ministers have been given, who have no experience of the ministry
 yah kadam aise samay par uthaaya gaya jab arthvyavastha najuk daur se guzar rahi he or use ek profeshnal or export netritv kii jarurat he
 - Nitin Gadkari was successfully running the Ministry of Highway, Road Transport and Shipping and now he will have to handle Namami Gange and Water Resources Ministry along with it
 yah kaarybhaar pehle uma bharti ke paas tha or vah saaf taur par jimmedaariyon ko nibhaane main vifal pai gayi
 Despite this he was not discharged and has been given the responsibility of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation
 - isi tarj par mumbai ke purv police kamishnar satya paal ko rajya mantri banaate hue human risource or water risource kaa kaarybhaar diya gaya he
 At the same time, Minister of State Dharmendra Pradhan, who has handled the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, will now do this work as a cabinet minister
 iske alaava unke supurd kendra sarkaar kii flagship yojana skill deveopment ko bhi kiya gaya he
 Puri and Alphons Kannanathanam have been given the status of Minister of State directly
 raajnneeti main unki pari ek prayog ke taur par he
 In the end, the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense to Nirmala Sitharaman is the most important change in the Modi government
 2019 chunaavon ke pehle yah mahila shashaktikaran kaa ishaara he or saaf sanket dene kii koshish he ki bijepi main sabhi ke liye samaan avasar uplabdh he
 Nirmala, successful in making her place in politics, did not get any special achievement during the tenure of Ministry of Commerce and Industry
 yahaan vah swatantra prabhaar vaali rajya mantri thim
 At the same time, Suresh Prabhu, who held the railway ministry with cabinet status for the last three years, has now been given the ministry of Nirmala
 prabhu ne teen saal ke dauraan rail ko sudhaarney kii kavayad kii lekin lagaataar ho rahe rail haadason ne sarkaar ko is badlaav ke liye majaboor kar diya
 Therefore, one thing is clear that for the next 20 months it does not matter for the Modi government that who is taking charge of which ministry
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah apane mishan 350 kii shuruyaat kar chuke hai
 Promotional ministers in Modi's cabinet, Dharmendra Pradhan (kerala), Puyush Goyal (tamil Nadu) and Nirmala Sitharaman (karnataka) have already been given the responsibility of election on behalf of Amit Shah

 china kii sattarudh communist party ne samvidhan se raashtrapati ke do kaarykaal kii seemaa hataane kaa prastaav rakhaa he
 This will probably open the way for President Xi Jinping to remain in power even after his second term

 According to Xinhua report, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) has proposed to remove this provision from the country's constitution

 The proposal to remove the tenure limit may be approved in the party's plenary session on Saturday

 No one is his future successor in the 7-member leadership that came out last year
 aise main is sambhaavna ko bal miltaa he ki shi kaa apane duusare kaarykaal ke baad bhi shashan karne kaa iraadaa he
 Since then, all parts of the party have disregarded the principle of collective leadership that has been in existence for the last three decades and has declared him the top leader of the party

 i have been describing Kota's coaching classes with an over-enthusiastic focus on multiple choice questions, ie Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ), as detrimental and subversive to students, and ultimately to iits
 vastav main bada sawaal yah he ki kyon IIT pravesh pariksha yaa JEE ke liye ab tak bahuviklpi prashnon vaale format kaa istemaal karte hai
 This was adopted by the Format machine to make grading possible, and then the need to become ever-increasing due to the ever-increasing number of applicants
 un peparon kaa moolyankan, jinamein har 'lambe' jawaab ko padhaa janaa hota tha, asambhav hota ja rahaa tha, kyonki IIT ke paas maanviya rup se paper jaanche jane ke liye paryaapt sansaadhan nahin the
 One possible solution to this problem was to outsource the work, but iits have been defending their exam's impartiality, and never included any outside agency
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki lagbhag 12 saal pehle jis vakt MCQ format ko apanaaya gaya tha, us vakt kisi ne kalpana bhi nahin kii thi ki yah itani gambhir samasyaayein paidaa kar degaa
 The important thing to be done now is the change in the pattern of examination, so that the process of accessing the answer will also have to be shown in detail in order to justify any correct answer that can be tested by the machine in MCQ
 jo bhi abhyarthi sahi jawaab denge, jawaab tak pahunchane kii unki prakriya ko maanviya rup se bhi jaancha jayega, jiskaa arth hoga - sansaadhan sirf un vidhyaarthiyon ke liye aavashyak honge, jinke jawaab sahi honge, or is prakriya se tukke lagane vaale apane aap galat sabit ho jaaenge
 Even if the answer is wrong, some points can be given for adopting the right way to reach the answer
 sambhawatah kuch sawaal is tarah bhi taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai, jinamein jawaab sankhya main aae, jinhen box main likhnaa hoga (online system main ise apnaanaa behad aasaan hoga), or un sabhi javaabon ke ank die jaaenge, jo ek had tak sahi hon, basharte jawaab tak pahunchane kaa tarika sahi paaya jaae
 The way to reach the answer should be examined only when the answer is acceptable
 is tarah kii pariksha, jo vidhyaarthiyon ke jawaab tak pahunchane ke tareeke kii bhi pariksha le, ke liye padhaayaa janaa (koching diya janaa) kahin zyaada kathin hoga, or har aire-gaire ko IIT kaa sapana bech dene kii koching udyog kii pravriti par roak laga sakati he
 As far as the candidates are concerned, studying according to the changed exam pattern (which includes detailed answers) will give them an opportunity to test their true abilities and abilities
 MCQ vaale sawaalon ko hal kar hasil kii gai 'kamyaabi' se vidhyaarthiyon main apni kshamtaaon ko lekar galat swa-akalan paidaa ho saktaa he, jo galat ummiden jagaa degaa
 Having such misconceptions about oneself will not be easy when writing detailed answers, which require basic knowledge of the subject
 sudhaaron ke liye ek anya suzav bhi diya jaataa rahaa he, lekin us par gambhirtha se kabhi charchaa yaa bahes nahin kii gai
 At the heart of this suggestion is to reduce the importance of JEE rank, and not to use JEE rank while allocating branches at the time of admission
 JEE rank ke sthaan par pehle saal main vidhyaarthiyon dwaara hasil kiye gaye ankon ko shakha aavantit karne kaa aadhaar banaaya jaae
 This will not only end the struggle to achieve the top rank in IIT-JEE - to some extent the pressure of becoming a coaching topper - but it also 'compels' the student to focus fully on studies in the first year after reaching IIT
 Will be isse ek or phayda yah hoga ki ho saktaa he ki kuch vidhyaarthee pichley saalon ke ghise-pite trend kii nakal karne ke sthaan par aisi shakhaaen chun len, jinamein vastav main unki ruchi he
 Of course, this idea also needs to be considered in further detail, as it will have many possibilities, such as sending the top 10,000 students to different iits, or students (according to JEE rank) of their choice
 Be given the option to choose an institution, not a branch
 in vichaaron kaa virodh kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki isse maujuuda santulan bighad jayega, khaastaur par behad maang main rahane vaale 'santhaan-shakha-jee rank' combination (udhaaharan ke liye IIT bombai - computer science - sheersh 100 rank) khatm ho jaaenge
 Another concern that often comes up is why IIT-JEE should be so difficult
 sabase pehle, IIT-JEE mote taur par usee paathyakram par aadhaarit rahata he, jo CBSE 12veen kaksha tak padhaati he, so, yah kahana tathyaatmak rup se sahi nahin he ki yah bahut hi vyapak tareeke se vishyon ko cover karata he
 Secondly, IIT-JEE is accused of being 'tough' and compared to board exams
 yah tulana hi galat he, kyonki donon parikshaayen kai myanon main katai alag hai - kisi bhi pratiyogi pariksha kaa uddeshy merit list main abhyarthiyon ko chunanaa hota he, so, ise jaanboojhkar board pariksha kii tulana main adhik chunauteepurn bananaa hi hoga, kyonki board pariksha kaa uddeshy sirf itnaa jaananaa hota he ki vidhyaarthee mote taur par apane vishay ko kitna jaanata he
 In addition, board exams are usually not sufficiently analytical, and are based on 'hard' and 'rote' (rote) methods
 lihaaza, iske vipareet, koi bhi aisa prashnptr, jisamen sochane, gaharaai se vishay ko samajhane kii zarurat ho, dikkat hi paidaa karegaa
 Ideally any sufficiently competent student - who has scored good marks in the board examination - should be able to score well in any competitive examination
 lekin jin par simaaon kaa zikr hamane upar kiya, unki vajah se zaruri nahin he ki har board topper ke dimag main vishay bilkul spasht hon, or usamen vishleshnatmak gun maujuud hon
 So, the questions asked in IIT-JEE are difficult
 isi vajah se sansthaanon se apni pravesh pariksha ko board pariksha ke hisaab se 'edjust' karne ke liye kaha janaa jaays prastaav nahin he
 Thirdly, the basic feature of any examination taken for the purpose of preparing merit list is to be 'difficult'
 agar ham ise bahut 'saral' bana denge, to oonche ank paane waalon kii taadaad bahut zyaada ho jaaegi, or agar ise 'bahut kathin' bana diya gaya, to vidhyaarthiyon kaa jamghat kam ank paane waalon kii taraf ho jayega
 Both results cannot prove to be helpful in making a rank list of students, so a properly prepared competitive examination will have to be adopted somewhere in the middle, and will always be 'difficult'
 MCQ se pehle ke yug main bhi IIT-JEE pariksha ab se zyaada kathin hua karti thi, or isaki vajah yah thi ki us vakt ke lambe sawaalon ke liye gaharaai se adhyayan karnaa hota tha, jabaki maujuuda format main har sawaal ke liye kuch hi minute die jate hai, jiskaa arth hua ki puche gaye sawaal kam jatil hai
 Coaching will not end with these steps
 jab tak aparyaapt or kharaab schuli shiksha maujuud rahegi, or abhyarthiyon va uplabdh siton kii sankhya main baari antar bana rahegaa, kota vaale prakaar samet sabhi tarah kii koching falti-phoolati rahegi
 Remember, only good schooling can make them irrelevant

 *** 2019 kii mahabharat kaa elaan hote hi chunaav tarikhon par bhi sangram shuru ho gaya he
 While some opposition parties are questioning the timing of the election announcement alleging the influence of the central government, there is a political rhetoric on voting during the holy month of Ramadan
 isaki ahm vajah kul 543 main se 169 loksabhaa siton par ramajaan ke dauraan voting hona bhi he
 Most of the seats in UP, Bihar, West Bengal and Delhi are to be voted in the last three phases
 10 march ko chunaav tarikhon kii ghoshnaa karte hue mukhya chunaav ayukta sunil aroda ne bataaya ki is baar saat charnon main loksabhaa chunaav karaae jaaenge
 After the first phase of voting on 11 April, voting for the remaining phases is to be held on 18 April, 23 April, 29 April, 6 May, 12 May and 19 May
 is saal ramajaan kaa mukaddas maheenaa 5 may se shuru ho rahaa he
 That is, the last three phases of voting on May 6, 12 and 19 will be held during Ramadan
 chunki ramajaan ke dauraan muslim samaaj ke log subah savere se shaam tak bina kuch khaae-pie rojaa rakhte hai, aise main ye sawaal uthaae jane lage hai ki roje or bheeshan garmi ke dauraan muslim matadaata ghanton tak line main lagakar kaise voting main hissaa le paaenge
 If this happens, the percentage of voting in Muslim-dominated areas of these states can be low and if the mathematics of voting is so, then the candidates of the opposing party of local parties who also vote may benefit from it
 
 islamic scollar ne jataayaa aitarajaislamic scollar or lakhanu idgah ke imam va shaharkaaji moulana khalid rashid farangi mahali ne 6 may se 19 may ke bich hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar kadi naaraazgi jataai he
 He has said that on 5 May, the moon of Ramadan, the holiest month of Muslims, will be seen
 agar chand dikh jaataa he to 6 may se roje shuru ho jaaenge
 He said that during the fast, voting will be held in the country on May 6, May 12 and May 19, due to which crores of Rojedars of the country will face trouble
 haalanki, chunaav kii ghoshnaa karte hue siisi sunil aroda ne kaha tha ki parv-tyoharon kaa dhyaan rakhte hue taarikh tay kii gai hai
 Maulana Khalid Rashid Firangi also said that the Election Commission should have decided the election schedule keeping in mind the Muslims of the country
 unhone chunaav ayog se maang kii he ki vah 6, 12 va 19 may ko hone vaale matdaan kii tithi badalane par vichaar kare
 Election may have an impact on how much voting can be seen during Ramadan in three major states of the country, UP, Bihar and West Bengal
 ye teen rajya na sirf loksabhaa siton kii sankhya ke lihaaj se bade hai, balki yahaan muslimon kii jansankhya bhi nirnaayak bhoomika main rahati he
 The interesting thing is that these three states will have elections in only seven phases
 uttar pradesh- 41 siton par ramajaan ke dauraan voting6 maiko hone vaale paanchaven charan main kul 14 siton par voting hogi
 These include Dhaurahra, Sitapur, Mohanlalganj (su
 ), lakhanu, raibareli, amethi, banda, fatehpur, kaushambi (su
 ), Barabanki (su
 ), faijabad, baharich, kaisarganj or gonda main matdaan hoga
 In the sixth phase on May 12, Sultanpur, Pratapgarh, Phulpur, Allahabad, Ambedkar Nagar, Shravasti, Dumriaganj, Basti, Santakbirnagar, Lalganj (su
 ), azamgarh, jonpur, machhlee shahar (su
 ) And voting will be held for a total of 14 seats including Bhadohi
 19 maisatven charan main mahrajganj, gorakhpur kushinagar devaria bansgaanv (su
 ), Ghosi Salempur Ballia Ghazipur Chandauli Varanasi Mirzapur and Robertsganj (su
 ) samet kul 13 siton ke liye vot padenge
 That is, during Ramadan, 41 Lok Sabha seats are to be voted in the total 80 seats of UP
 bihar- 21 siton par ramajaan ke dauraan voting6 maiko sitamarhi, madhubani, mujffarpur, saaran or hajipur main matdaan hoga
 While on May 12, voting will be held in Valmikinagar, West Champaran, East Champaran, Shivhar, Vaishali, Gopalganj, Siwan and Maharajganj seats
 19 maiko patna sahib, nalanda, patliputra, aara, baxur, sasaram, jahanabad or karakaat main voting hogi
 In the last three phases, during Ramadan, voting will be done on 21 seats out of total 40 seats in Bihar
 pashchim bengal va dilli- 31 siton par ramajaan ke dauraan votingpaschim bengal main kul 42 loksabhaa siten hai
 This time there will be voting on 7 seats under fifth phase on 6 May, 8 seats under sixth phase on 12 May and 9 seats under seventh phase on 19 May i
e
 a total of 24 seats will be voted on during Ramadan
 iske alaava dilli kii sabhi saat siton par 12 may ko voting karai jaaegi
 Explain that 17 percent of Muslims are in Bihar, 20 percent in UP and 27 percent in West Bengal
 in teen rajyon ke siyaasi sameekaran ko dekha jaae to upi main 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ko ekatarfa 71 siton par jeet mili thi, jabaki is chunaav main halaat juda hai
 Both SP-BSP have come together, thereby speculating that Dalit and Muslim and Yadav voters can come together against BJP
 bihar main bhi lalu prasad yadav kii argedy ne congress, araspi va jeethanram maanjhi ke saath haath mila liya he, jisase bijepi-jediu gathbandhan ke liye chunauti bad gai he
 In West Bengal, Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee has a unanimous rule
 2014 main modi lahar ke baavjood yahaan tiemasi ne 42 main 34 siton par baaji maari thi
 TMC leader raised questions: Mayor of Kolkata and TMC leader Farhad Hakim said that elections are going to be held in seven phases in Bihar, UP and Bengal and minority population is very high in these three states
 unhone kaha ki roje ke dauraan voting kerani hogi, chunaav ayog ko iskaa dhyaan rakhana chahie tha
 Farhad Hakim also alleged that BJP does not want minorities to vote for themselves
 AAP vidhayak ne kaha- bijepi ko hoga phydamuslim dharmaguru ke alaava dilli main aam aadmi party ke muslim chehre or okhla vidhansabha seat se vidhayak amanatullah khan ne bhi ramajaan ke dauraan voting par sawaal uthaae hai
 He claims to have benefited BJP directly
 amanatullah ne is sambandh main twit karte hue likhaa, '12 may kaa din hoga dilli main ramajaan hoga musalmaan vot kam karegaa iskaa sidhaa phayda bijepi ko hoga
 'may 12 will be Ramadan in Delhi, Muslims will reduce votes, BJP will directly benefit from this
 — Amanatullah Khan AAP (@khanamanatullah)march 10, 2019ek dilachasp aankada ye bhi he ki khaskar teen bade rajyon (upi,bihar, bengal) kii aadhe se zyada siton par aakhri teen charnon main yani ramajaan ke dauraan hi voting honi he
 Apart from these, 12 seats of Rajasthan, 23 of Madhya Pradesh, 11 of Jharkhand and 10 seats of Haryana, 2 seats of Jammu and Kashmir, 13 seats of Punjab, 4 seats of Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh are also to be voted during Ramadan
 bhi ramajaan ke dauraan voting honi he
 Although Ramadan will not be affected by voting, it was a different situation in the by-elections in Kairana Lok Sabha seat and Nurpur assembly seat in West UP in 2018
 kairana main muslim samaaj ke log iviem main kharabi ke baavjood poling booth par date najar aae the, yahaan tak ki unhone shaam ke vakt rojaa-iftaar bhi booth par hi kiya tha
 While stating the important role of private medical colleges and dental colleges in the expansion of medical and health services in Madhya Pradesh, Health and Family Welfare Minister Mahendra Hardia has said that the state government intends that one of the complaints received from these institutions from time to time It should be resolved effectively

 So happy to see a gate named after you 2 / 2 Sonia Gandhi became the interim president after Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post of Congress president
 party kii kaman aise daur main unke haath phir se ai he jab congress bure daur se guzar rahi he
 It is a coincidence that when she became the president for the first time in 1998 under pressure and pressure from party leaders, the Congress was in a bad state
 us vakt party ke paas sirf 141 loksabhaa sadsy the
 Now when he has commanded during the ongoing crisis in the party for the second time, there are only 52 Lok Sabha members
 sabase lambey samay tak adhyaksh raheen sonia gandhi ke khate main centre kii satta main congress ko do baar pahunchane kaa shrey jaataa he
 The question is arising whether after becoming the interim president of the Congress, Sonia Gandhi will be able to unite the opposition scattered against the BJP
 yaa phir rahul gandhi ke 20 maheene ke kaarykaal main samanvay kii kami se kamjor hote upie ko phir se majboot karne main safal hongi
 Questions are also arising that even though Rahul Gandhi gave the party 52 seats in 2019 as against 44 in 2014, he could neither keep the opposition united nor strengthen it by properly coordinating between UPA allies
 yahi vajah rahi ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main zyaadaatar prabhavi kshetreey dal congress se alag apni dhapli apana raag alaapte dikhe
 'opposition should have tools for new ideas' Urmilesh, a senior journalist, says that today bjp's opposition based on the foundation of Hindutva and corporate alliance can compete only if it has the tools of new ideas
 jab tak vipaksh nae vichaaron ko dharaatal par lagu karne kii nai style nahin apnayega, tab tak maujuuda hindutv-karporate gathbandhan kii neenv par khadi bijepi or centre sarkaar ko chunauti nahin di ja sakati
 Can Sonia Gandhi unite the opposition under the Congress flag, compared to Rahul Gandhi? On this question, Urmilesh says that Sonia Gandhi is more practical, less ideological
 jabaki rahul gandhi idological zyada hai or vyaavhaarik kam
 It may be that Sonia's practical side will be used to strengthen the UPA or the opposition
 magar adhyaksh ke taur par sonia or rahul kii tulana tarksangat nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi wanted to make Congress an inclusive party, he tried to start it at the organizational level
 nae daur kii nai party banane kii disha main kaam shuru kiya tha
 It is a matter of fact that he could not do it
 jahaan tak sonia kii baat he to aaj ke or 2004 ke halaat alag the
 At that time, Vajpayee did not have a BJP government of his own
 gathbandhan sarkaar ke kuch faislon se janata main niraashaa thi, tab aaj kii tulana main aresas kaa utana thos or aakraamak abhiyaan nahin tha
 Hindutva and corporate were not aligned
 vahiin dalit, obisi kii raajnneeti karne vaale kshetreey dalon ke netaaon kii chhaviyaan pehle itani kharaab nahin thim
 All these equations then eased the way for the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) to be formed
 jisase bijepi virdohi gathbandhan banane main sonia gandhi ko kamyaabi mili
 Whereas during the time of Rahul Gandhi, BJP remained in power with a strong majority
 2014 se 2019 main kahaan pahunchaa upie2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav jab hua tha, tab sonia gandhi congress kii adhyaksh thi
 During that time the Congress had got only 44 seats, while the UPA could reach only 60 seats
 jabaki 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav ke vakt rahul gandhi adhyaksh rahe
 During this time the Congress got 52 seats, while the UPA seats increased to 91 seats
 rahul gandhi ke daur main congress madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main sarkaar banane main safal rahi
 The relationship between the boss and you is very important in improving the office environment
 bhale hi aap kaam main kitne achche hai , lekin agar aapkaa rishta bos ke saath kharaab he, to ye aapke kariyar or naukari ke liye hanikaarak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, as far as impressing the boss is concerned, in this case, Chamchagiri will not work
 balki aapako in 7 baton ko lekar gambhir hona hoga
 1
 apane bos kii jimmedaariyon or chintaaon ko samajhen
 Do the work in such a way that you can connect yourself to their priorities
 har intervyuu main puche jate hai ye 7 ahm sawaal, is tarah den jawaab2
 Do not pay attention to the bad things of the boss, pay attention to their positive things
 is ek quality se aap apane bos ke or bhi najadik aa sakate hai
 3
 aap kaam main kitna acha kar rahe hai or kya nayaa plan kar rahe hai, is bare main bos ko suchit karen
 4
 kisi galati ke ho jane par maafee maangana koi galat nahin he
 Doing this shows that you are not arrogant and are always ready to take feedback from the boss
 IAS ke intervyuu main puche jate hai aise sawaal, jawaab he kaaphi dilachasp5
 Occasionally you go out with the boss for lunch and coffee
 aisa karne se aap donon ke bich achche relation banate hai
 6
 hameshaa yaad rakhen ki aapke bos ke upar bhi ek bos he, jise khush karne kaa kaam aapke bos kaa he
 In this case, help them to fulfill their boss's target
 is tarah big bos or aapke bos kii najar main aapkaa kad or ooncha ho jayega
 7
 us samay jab offis main har koi aapaki kamyaabi kii tarif kar rahaa ho, tab aap apane bos kii saraahna karnaa naa bhoolen kyonki bina bos kii madad or protsaahan ke koi bhi karmchaaree aage nahin bad saktaa

 According to the Hindu calendar, Jeevataputrika is fasting today
 ise bharat ke kuch hisson main jiutiya vrath bhi kehete hai
 It is a Nirjala fast, which is performed by married women for the longevity of their offspring
 yah vrath asina maah krishna paksh kii ashtami ko manaaya jaataa he
 However, it is celebrated up to three times in the Hindu calendar
 yah kushna paksh kii saptami se shuru hokar navami tak chalata he
 Just like Chhath Vrat, in this fast, bathing on the first day is eaten
 duusare din nirjala vrath or tisare din paaran hota he
 This fast is especially prevalent in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Nepal
 is barjiutiya vrataki shuruyaat 13 sitambar ko 01:01 baje se 22:48 baje tak he
 Actually, Ashtami is engaged in this Muhurta
 isaliejiutiya vrath yaa jitiya vrathbhi isi muhoort main hoga
 How to do Paranjiautiya fast, before taking Parana, take a bath meditation and worship it methodically
 iske baad maduva kii roti khaakar vrath toden
 There is a law of passing the Jhor Bhat, Noni's greens and Madua bread
 kya he mahatvakaha jaataa he ki ek jangal main chil or lomadee gum rahe the
 Then he saw some people fasting and reading his story
 chil ne bahut hi dhyaan se jiutiya ke pujan vidhi ko dekha or katha suni
 But the fox had little attention to this
 iske baad chil kii santan ko dderghaayu kaa vardaan mila or yahi vajah he ki chil kii aayu lambii hoti he
 At the same time the fox's offspring did not survive
 is prakaar is vrath kaa bahut adhik mahatv bataaya jaataa he
 The offspring of the mother who does this gets the boon of longevity and always avoids accidents and crises
 vrath kathayah vrath mahabharat kaal se judaa he
 Ashwathama was heartbroken after his father died after the Mahabharata war
 usne iskaa badla lene kii thaan lee or pandavon ke shivi main pahunch kar usne vahaan so rahe paanch logon kii hatya kar di
 He thought that he killed the five Pandavas
 lekin tabhi uske saamne paanchon pandav aakar khadey ho gaye
 Actually, the five people he murdered were the sons of Draupadi
 arjuna ne ashwathama ko bandi bana liya or uski divya mani usase chin lee
 The fire of Ashwathama's return increased further and he used Brahmastra to kill the offspring in Uttara's womb
 brahmastra ke maar ko nishphal karnaa naammumkin tha, isliye bhagwaan krishna ne uttara kii ajanmi santan ko apana sara punya de diya or garbh main hi dobaaraa uttara kii santan ko jivit kar diya
 Being alive in the womb, his name became alive and this king was further tested
 tab hi se is vrath ko kiya jaataa he
 There is also this story of Jitiya Vrat, there was a city named Kanchanabati near the popular Narmada River
 vahaan kaa raja malyketu tha
 To the west of the Narmada River was the desert, which was called Baluhata
 vahaan vishaal pakad kaa ped tha
 The eagle lived on it
 ped ke neeche khodhar tha, jisamen siaarin rahati thi
 Both Chil and Sarin were friends
 ek baar donon ne milakar jitiya vrath karne kaa sankalp liya
 Then both of them kept the Nirjala fast for the worship of Lord Jeetavahana
 vrath vaale din us nagar ke bade vyapaaree kii mrityu ho gayi
 Now he was cremated at the same desert
 kaali raat hui or ghanghor gata barasane lagi
 Sometimes lightning strikes, sometimes clouds thunder
 toofaan aa gaya tha
 Siyarin was now hungry
 murda dekhakar vah khud ko roak na saki or uskaa vrath tut gaya
 But the eagle kept sobriety and followed the fast on the next day with rules and reverence
 Then in the next birth both the women were born as daughters in the Brahmin family
 unke pita kaa naam bhaskar tha
 Chil became the elder sister and was named Shilwati
 shilvati kii shaadi buddhisen ke saath hui
 Siyaran was born as a younger sister and was named Kapuravati
 uski shaadi us nagar ke raja malayaketu se hui
 Now Kapuravati became the queen of Kanchanabati Nagar
 bhagwaan jiutvahan ke aashirwad se shilvati ke saat bete hue
 But all the children of Kapuravati died as soon as they were born
 kuch samay baad shilvati ke saaton putr bade ho gaye
 They all started working in the king's court
 kapuravati ke man main unhen dekh irshyaa kii bhaavana aa gayi
 He told the king and cut off the heads of all the sons
 unhen saat nae bartan mangvakar usamen rakh diya or laal kapade se dhakkar shilvati ke paas bhijwa diya
 Seeing this, Lord Jiutavahana made the heads of the seven brothers out of clay and sprinkled nectar on everyone's head by attaching it to his torso
 isse unamem jaan aa gai
 The seven men became alive and returned home
 jo kate sar rani ne bheje the ve fal ban gaye
 Rani Kapuravati, on the other hand, was anxious to get information from Budhisen's house
 jab kaaphi der soochna nahin ai to kapuravati swayan badi bahan ke ghar gayi
 She was shocked to see everyone alive there
 jab use hosh aayaa to bahan ko usne sari baat bataai
 Now he was regretting his mistake
 bhagwaan jiutvahan kii krupa se shilvati ko purv janm kii baaten yaad aa gayi
 She went to the same Pakad tree with Kapuravati and told him all the things
 kapuravati behosh ho gai or mar gai
 When the king got the news of this, he went to the same place and cremated Kapuravati under the Pakad tree

 Believed adivasee garib parivaar kii sita behara kii kahanebehara boleen- electrician hum jo tower par chadhati hunadivasee sita behara kii kahani farsh se arsh par pahunchane kii he
 Sita's journey from a girl from a very poor family to a 'transmission queen' is an example for the daughters of the country
 sita kii kahani berhampur ke psoran gaanv main ghasphoos kii ek jhopadi main rahane vaale parivaar se shuru hoti he
 It was also not possible for the fisherman head of the family to feed two children bread for two times
 sita or uski teen bahanon, ek bhai ko kai raat khaali pet hi sona padataa tha
 The situation became more difficult when Sita's elder sister came to the family to live with two children due to the death of her husband
 garibi ne sikhyasita kaa kahana he, 'garibi ne unhen chizon ko sakaaratmak dhang se dekhnaa sikhaaya
 It was very difficult to isolate, but there was nothing to lose, this helped to build my confidence
 'sita civil seva pariksha ke liye taiyaari karnaa chaahati thi jisase parivaar or gaanv ke halaat badalane ke liye kuch kar sake
 But given the poor financial condition of the family, this was not possible for Sita
 aise main sita ne ITI (audyogic prashikshan santhaan), beharampur main daakhila liya
 Sita recalls iti's days that the total stipend of Rs 40,000 she received from the Odisha Skill Development Authority for two years helped her pay college and hostel fees
 saath hi electrician ke taur kariyar banane ke liye utsahvardhan bhi hua
 Sita had to face many social difficulties to make her place in this area dominated by Tanjpurus by saying ITI-ITI
 sita jab bhi chuttee par psoran gaanv main apane ghar aatin to ITI kii pant-kameez vaali uniform main dekhakar ladke mazaaq udaate
 Also, 'ITI', 'ITI' used to tighten
 sita ke mutabik, ye aisa tha ki jaise ladki hone ke naate ITI main daakhila lekar koi paap kiya ho
 Sita was the first girl in the village to get admission in a technical institute and the boys of the village felt that only boys could do this
 aaj sita tees feet oonche bijli ke tower par electrician kaa kaam karte hue gaurav kaa anubhav karti hai
 She is now able to give good living to her family members, as well as providing good education to her younger sisters and brothers
 odisha power transmishan korporation limited (OPTCL) main karyrat 25 varshiya sita kaa haal main odisha skill development athurity ne sammanit kiya
 Authority chairman Subroto Bagchi praised Sita for naming her the 'queen of Transmission Tower'
 bagchi ne kaha, 'sahi badlaav tab hota he jab koi shaks apni jindagi kaa khud charge sambhalata he or hajaaron yuvaaon ke liye role model ban jaataa he
 Sita Behera is a role model for us
 wo saahas kii adbhut misaal he
 Sometimes there are difficult social barriers with skill
 khaas taur par ladakiyon ke liye
 When Sita was studying in ITI, the boys of the village used to harass her by calling her ITI, ITI
 yahaan tak ki uskaa naam hi ITI daal diya gaya
 In such a situation, enemies are from our side in the way of progress
 gaanv main hi dushman hai
 50% of the population said that women were trying to break her spirits
 lekin ab sita safalataa kii kahani he
 The big problem is said among our people, our families that this work is not for girls
 bharat main 50% aabaadi mahilaon kii he
 If girls are not sent for skill development, then it can be understood that in which direction we are
 'sita behara ne kaha, 'main OPTCL main junior technician ke pad par hum
 i climb the tower to maintain the power supply
 main apane gaanv se pehali electrician hum jo tower par chadhati hum, kyonki main garib parivaar se hum, isliye naukari kii sakht talash thi
 Then it does not matter whether to climb the 30 feet high tower or do anything else

 marij ko khun chadhaane kii jarurat nahin padati
 The patient has to stay in the hospital for a short time after surgery, which also reduces the cost of treatment
 cosmesis iskaa ek or phayda he jiske chalate aaj badi sankhya memmarijarobotic surgery kaa vikalp chun rahe hai

 The sourness between the Ambani brothers now seems to have gone a long way
 mukesh ambani ne aaj kaha ki unki company reliance industries chote bhai anil ambani ke bijli sanyantron ke taiyaar ho jane par unhen gas kii aapurti karegi
 Addressing the shareholders of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), Mukesh Ambani today said that the Supreme Court decision has confirmed the company's statement that D

 chah blaak se nikalne vaali gas ke mulya nirdhaaran or aavanton main sarkaar kii aham bhoomika he
 He clarified that gas will be supplied to Anil Dhirubhai Ambani's power plants, but this work will be in accordance with government policy
 mukesh ne kaha ‘‘ab jabaki kanoonee ladai samaapt ho chuki he ham anil samooh ke saath sauhardpurn or rachanaatmak sambandh rakhenge
 There was also speculation about Anil Ambani's arrival at this annual general meeting of Reliance Industries Limited but he did not come
 mukesh ambani ne kaha ki dilli ke najadik dadri main prastaavit bijli ghar sahit anil companiyon ke bijli gharon ko gas aavanton kii sarkari manjuuri ke baad hi aapurti kii jaayegi
 It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court in its decision last month said that the two brothers should come up with a fresh dialogue keeping in mind the government policies on price and allocation on the issue of gas supply
 mukesh ambani ne haalanki apane sambodhan main yah nahin kaha ki unki company reliance industries limited anil ambani kii company reliance natural resorcij limited (arenarel) ke saath gas bikri or kharid kaa samjhauta kab karegi
 In its judgment on 7 May 2010, the Supreme Court rejected Anil's rnrl's plea that ril's KG at a cheaper rate based on the agreement reached between the Ambani family in 2005
 di6 basin se gas aapurti kaa daawa kiya tha
 The court said that gas is the property of the government and its pricing and distribution comes under its jurisdiction
 ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirnay ke baad ambani bandhuon ke bich pehle huye gaiyr
 The competition agreement was terminated and the two brothers' companies entered into a new agreement for cordial competition with each other
 iske baad se hi mukesh ambani or anil ke bich nazdikiyaan badhane lagi or aaj mukesh ambani kii taraf se bhi isaki saarvajanik sweekruti saamne aa gai he

 Chidambaram said, this is a mild cut and the US Federal Reserve has not announced any gradual reduction
