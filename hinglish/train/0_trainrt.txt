 Whatever we consume, so does ours

 Selfie is a new form of our cosmic life which increases the rate of GDP by consumption or increases in GDP by increasing the consumption of selfie
 samvaad bhi upbhog hi he
 Consumption of dialogue is causing waste
 ham kachare ko samvaad banaakar failaa rahe hai
 Writing anything and reading anything
 jab in donon ke liye kuch nahin hota to khud ko dekhne or dikhaane lag jate hai
 Selfie is a kind of photo waste
 pehle selfi main koi ek hota tha ab kai hone lage hai
 Several frames are poked in a frame
 chehre kaa cheharaa bemaani ho gaya he
 a smile is prepared before it is clicked
 sab apane ko ekbar ke liye dekhte hai or clic ho jate hai
 If success is also determined, it is also a selfie
 selfi aatm ke aas-paas ek bheed he jo hamen kaamyaab hone kaa ahsaas karaati he
 We cannot live alone and call selfie when no one is together
 selfi bheed se ghir jane kii ichha kaa pratifal he
 As soon as it is posted on Facebook, everything changes with the receipt of Like like hamaari mahatvakanksha kaa dayaneey rup he
 Selfie is the cover of this patheticness
 duniya kii vividhta kaa tezi se khaatmaa ho rahaa he
 The similarities have increased in the US and Kolkata or Delhi and Dubai
 dekhnaa ek boring kaam ho gaya he
 The super-mall is our present-day historic building
 aitihaasik imaaraton kii replika yani anukriti kab se bik rahi he
 It was natural that we left the world and started to see ourselves
 landan pahunchakar bhi log khud ko dekh rahe hai
 Pulling selfies
 dukaanon or shaharon kii tarah ham sab bhi pahanaave se lekar aadaton main ek jaise ho gaye hai
 The frame has one or all the same
 selfi hamaare aatm kii vividhta ke khatme kaa pratik he
 We are all selfies
 khud kaa har pal sanchay kar rahe hai par darasal ye upbhog karnaa he
 The smaller the shop, the smaller the product sizes
 mahanagaron ke ajeeb ajeeb konon main dubkee-simati dukaanon main rakhe shampoo, tel, sabun, agarbatti, biscuit or chocolate ke laghu sanskaran selfi hi hai
 Selfie we all have to be small
 sankuchit
 Soon we will get bored of this consumption
 ham bina upbhog ke shanti nahin paa sakate
 Consumption is spirituality
 upbhog karo
 Consumption makes the nation grow and citizens get content
 yah jo saal guzara he wo bataa rahaa he ki ham ab anukanon kaa upbhog karenge
 a selfie is a representation of our vast self
 aap is lekh ko padhakar chakkar kha rahe honge
 Must be thinking that the journalist's mind is right
 par kya hamaara selfikaran nahin hua he? jo isse bache hai ve behad garib hai
 So poor that he does not even have an account on social media
 babagiri kuch or nahin balki devatv kaa selfi he
 Selfie is nothing but the divinity of self

 Can i become baba aadhyatm kaa upbhog karne ke liye meraa baba bananaa zaruri he! meraa ek or selfi hona chahie
 Self is heaven and selfie is supernatural communication

 When asked about how the team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who was eliminated from the ICC World Cup 2015 after losing the semi-final match to Australia, will stop Steven Smith, New Zealand said, 'A lot depends on the performance of Daniel Vettori
 wo aise player hai jo middle overs main wicket nikaal sakate hai
 'he said,' He will not let his balls run easily nor will he play big shots
 isliye wo hi sabase ahm honge
 Dhoni further said, 'this match is absolutely balanced
 cricket ke is chote formet main nateeja is par nirbhar karata he ki us din koun si team behatar pradarshan karti he
 We have seen New Zealand competing
 ’yah pratishthit world cap trophy ab brendan maikalam yaa maaikel clark uthaaenge is par dhoni ne kaha, ‘yah wo chiz he jo kisi ek kaa nahin he

 No single team has this for a very long time
 ’gauratlab he ki 2015 cricket world cap kaa final muqabla ravivaar ko australia or newjiland ke bich melbern cricket ground (emsiji) par khelaa janaa he
 Australia, who defeated India by 95 runs in a semi-final match, is not considered by many analysts to be as balanced due to the lack of a good spin bowler

 "unfortunately, at this time, NSCN-IM has taken a late stand and is raising controversial issues like a separate Naga national flag and the constitution on which they are fully aware of the Government of India's stand," the statement said
 'ravi ke bayaan isliye myne rakhte hai ki centre sarkaar ne anuchhed 370 ke tahat jammu-kashmir ko mili vishesh darje ko paanch agast ko samaapt karne kii ghoshnaa kar di thi or rajya ko do centre shasit kshetron main baant diya tha

 The format of the agreement comes after 80 rounds of negotiations for 18 years
 isamen pehali safalataa 1997 main mili thi jab nagaland main dashakon tak ugravad ke baad sangharshaviram samjhauta hua tha
 The insurgency started in Nagaland soon after India's independence in 1947

 pakistani adaalaton ne mumbai 26 / 11 hamale ke mastermind hafiz said ke khulaa ghoomane kaa rasta taiyaar kar diya he
 His release from detention in Pakistan can now be done at any time
 is ghatnakram ko bharat ke saath america ne bhi gambhirtha se liya he
 a US State Department official said on Wednesday, "the administration is aware of media reports that have ordered release from house arrest at lashkar-e-taiba leader Hafiz Saeedki's house
 ’ america apane is mat par kaayam he ki hafiz said global terrarist he or uske sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba ke khilaaf america ke pratibandh aage bhi jari rahenge
 Just a few days before the 26 / 11 attack completed nine years, a Pakistani court ordered the release of Hafiz
 adaalat ne pakistan kii prantiy sarkaar kii us apil par bhi vichaar nahin kiya jisame hafiz kii najarbandi ko mentanence of public order (MPO) ke tahat teen maheene or badhaane kii maang kii gai thi
 The Pakistan government had feared that the release of Hafiz would lead the international community to impose sanctions
 haalanki pakistan sarkaar kaa hi doharaa cheharaa khud benakaab ho gaya kyonki usne khud hi aise koi saboot pesh nahin kiye jisase ki ye sabit ho ki kyon hafiz ko najarband rakhana jaruri he
 This became the basis for the court to order the release of Hafiz
 jahaan tak america kii baat he to vahaan kii congress ke haalia faisle kii kaaphi aalochana hui thi, jisamen pakistan ko america se vittiya sahaayta milane ko is baat se alag kar diya gaya tha ki pakistan lashkar-e-taiyaba ke khilaaf kya karrwai karata he
 However, it was made clear by the American administration that it stands on its belief that Hafiz Saeed is a global terrorist
 america prashasan ne may 2008 main hafiz ko akjicutive order 13324 ke tahat ‘speshieli dejignated global terrarist’ ghoshit kiya tha
 In December 2008, after the 26 / 11 attack, the United Nations also personally pointed to Hafiz under UNSCR 1267
 26 / 11 hamale ke gunahagaaron ko kanoonee anjaam tak laane ke liye bharat or america milakar kaam karte aae hai
 Intelligence inputs and evidence for this have also been shared among themselves
 bataa den ki 26 / 11 hamale main maare gaye logon main kuch america naagarik bhi shaamil the
 The US State Department official said, "the US reiterates its view that lashkar-e-taiba is a listed foreign terrorist organization responsible for killing hundreds of innocent people in terror attacks, including many American citizens
" 
 ’adhikari ne aage kaha, ‘lashkar-e-taiyabaor iske kai frontal sanghathan, netaa or sadsy videsh vibhaag or tregeri department, donon ke pratibandhon ke daayre main bane hue hai
 Hafiz Saeed has been under house arrest in Pakistan since January 31 this year
 lekin ab adaalat ke aadesh ke baad kisi bhi samay uski rihaai ho sakati he
 America has also announced a reward of 10 million US dollars on the head of 26 / 11 Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz

 Against this evil practice in the backward area, a woman SHO has set a good example
 vahaan daliton ne ek navaratri pandal sajaayaa, lekin puja ke liye koi pujari vahaan nahin pahunchaa
 In such a situation, the woman Thanedar herself performed the puja in place of Pandit
 damoh jile ke patera block ke kota gaanv main dalit samudaay ke logon ne navaratri ke dauraan devi puja ke liye pandal banaaya
 He also brought a statue of the Goddess for installation in Pandal
 lekin pratimaa sthapana kaa vakt aayaa to daliton ke pandal main puja ke liye koi pujari nahin pahunchaa
 On the spot, Inspector Anjali reached Udenia, first she called the priest
 raat bahut hoti ja rahi thi, pujari ke aane main der hone par anjali ne vardi main khud hi kalash sthapit karne kaa faisla kiya
 Anjali said that she belongs to the Brahmin society and she herself recites the pooja from the Vidhan Vidhan Vidhi
 anjali kii is pahal ne sabhi ke chehron par khushi laa di
 a Pandit came forward to see the woman Thanedar worshiping him
 lekin tab tak anjali puja ke liye baith chuki thim
 According to Anjali, he did not think it right to leave the worship in the middle and set up the statue as per the instruction of Pandit
 is ghatana kii khabar faili to ilaake main jo puja paath karaate hai wo safai dene lage ki anya jagahon par pujan main vyast hone kii vajah se ve yahaan nahin pahunch sake
 He also denied anything like untouchability
 vahiin gaanv ke hi rahane vaale kripal ne kaha ki ve devi kii pratimaa kii sthapana ke liye pujari ko bulaane gaye the lekin unhone saaf kah diya ki ham sthapana nahin karenge
 Presented a unique example of social harmony in women thanedars
 haalanki unhone is ghatana par samay kii kami kaa tark dekar jatigat bhedbhaav jaisi kisi baat par pardaa daalane kaa bhi prayaas kiya
 However, the amount of praise that Anjali Uddeniya did for performing the duty of police along with breaking social malpractices is low

 In the last months of his tenure, the Central Government suddenly introduced a bill, in addition to the reservation given to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes, 10% reservation for those upper castes, Muslims and Christians in education sector and government jobs
 Was proposed to be considered economically backward
 isaki paribhaasha main aath lakh rupee se kam vaarshik aay athwa paanch acre se kam zamin athwa1,000vargafoot se kam aakaar kaa makaan aadi maanak tay kiye gaye

 bataaya gaya he 10 karodabhfmpariwaron ke50karod sadasyon ko is yojana kaa laabh dene ke baad isamen shesh bharatiyon ko bhi shaamil kiya jayega
 The Ujjwala scheme is basically said to be the brainchild of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who appealed to millions of affluent Indians to voluntarily give up subsidy on LPG cylinders, and the central government claims that this appeal has resulted in crores of people Abandoned the subsidy, and this led to LPG reaching the kitchens of five crore poor women, or their families
 He got direct benefit

 The Narendra Modi government said that even after almost 70 years of independence, millions of the country's population remained untouched by the banking system, and most of the people did not even have a bank savings account, so they brought this scheme, Zero-balance bank savings accounts were opened

 desh kii lagaataar badhati aabaadi ke bich berojgaare aisi samasya rahi he,jisane adhiktar bharatiyon ko pareshaan kar rakhaa he
 With a view to dealing with this problem, the Narendra Modi government tried to divert people to self-employment, and started the Mudra Yojana, urging the youth to set up their own businesses, under which loans are provided by the government
 , So that people can start their own business or expand an already established business
 is yojana ko bhi sarkaar khaasaa kaamyaab bataati he,or uskaa daawa he ki may, 2018tak mudra yojana ke antargat12,78,08,684rin vitarit kiye gaye hai
 The problems of the farmers in the country were seen to be increasing continuously, and the news of suicides by farmers has become very common today, which has not stopped till now

 The Central Government claims that the Soil Health Card will directly benefit the farmers and with the help of this card, they will not only understand the fertile power of the land, but will also be able to know how much urea and fertilizer for which crop they have to spend
 
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki is soyal health card kii madad se kisaanon ko apni aay badhaane main madad milegi
 Along with the ever-increasing population in the country, the demand for electricity is also increasing continuously, to deal with this, the Central Government has urged the public to replace LED bulbs in place of ordinary bulbs, tubelights and CFL bulbs
 Be used so that power consumption can be reduced
 yahi nahin,sarkaar ne ujaalaa yojana ke antargat sasti daron paravakembulb bhi uplabdh karwaae,or narendra modi sarkaar kaa daawa he ki ujaalaa yojana ke tahat may, 2018tak29,96,35,477 ledbalba logon main baante gaye hai

 In Chhattisgarh, the Congress, which has been away from power for the last fifteen years, has tried a new tactic to surround the BJP
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh bhupesh baghel kaa aarope he ki chauthi baar satta main aane ke liye bijepi ab tantra-mantra kaa sahaara le rahi he
 At the same time, BJP has called it the mental insanity of the Congress
 darasal, raipur main sthit vidhansabha main buudhvaar ko ek baba aae
 He is none other than Baba, a priest of a temple in Janjgir Champa district of Chhattisgarh and also an active BJP worker
 bataaya jaataa he ki ye baba amarnath yatra ke liye nikle the, or kuch der raipur main rukne ke baad apane gantavy kii ore ravaanaa ho gaye
 But the Congress fears that Baba has come out of the Vidhan Sabha by performing a tantra-mantra
 chhattisgarh vidhansabha main monsoon satr ke chauthe din sadan kii kaarywahi apane niyamit samay par shuru hui
 But there was a lot of discussion among Congressmen in the assembly corridor outside the House that the BJP is resorting to tantra-mantra for coming to power for the fourth time
 jitani munh utani baat
 But no one saw tantra-mantra happening
 bataa den ki buudhvaar ko ek baba daan dakshina ke chakkar main vidhansabha parisar main pahunche the
 Baba returned after the rounds of legislators and ministers' offices
 is baat kii kisi ko jaankaree nahin he ki unhen kisi ne daan-dakshina di yaa nahin di
 But Baba was asking for financial help from people by saying that he should go on Amarnath Yatra
 phir ve kareeb 35-40 minute tak parisar main netaaon or vidhayakon kii khojbin karte rahe
 He then withdrew from the assembly
 lekin congress ko andeshaa he ki ye baba daan-dakshina ke liye nahin balki tantra-mantra ke liye vidhansabha aae the
 So that for the fourth time BJP again comes to power
 congreska aarope he ki baba yahaan tantra-mantra karke gaye hai
 The Congress also alleges that the BJP is resorting to tantric actions to come to power for the fourth time
 vahiin vidhansabha parisar ke andar baahar kisi ne bhi baba ko naa to tantra-mantra karte dekha he or naa hi puja-paath
 Apart from mlas, leaders, officers and journalists, the general public keeps on visiting the assembly all the time
 aam janata sadan kii kaarywahi dekhne ke liye yahaan aati he
 While police and security officers of the Legislative Assembly are also posted in the Vidhan Sabha premises round the clock
 itane baari-bharkam jamaavade ke bich kisi ne bhi baba ko tantra-mantra karte nahin dekha
 No such sightings were found in any security cameras
 vidhansabha parisar ke andar baahar kahi bhi aise koi pramaan nahin mila he, jisase pataa chalata ho ki yahaan koi tantra-mantra yaa puja-paath hua ho
 The Congress itself has not been able to provide any such evidence, through which the tantra-mantra is confirmed
 lihaaja, bijepi ne congress ke aaropon ko lekar us par palatwaar kiya he
 The party argues that the Congress has not only become superstitious due to being out of power for fifteen consecutive years, but has also corrupted its intelligence
 vidhayak raju kshatreey ne congressiyon ke aaropon ko niraadhaar bataate hue kaha ki ve tantra-mantra kaa koi ek pramaan to de
 He said that the Vidhan Sabha is a public place
 yahaan apane netaaon or vidhayakon ko sadan kii kaarywahi main sahabhaagi banate dekhne ke liye aam janata aksar aati he
 Making such allegations among many people does not suit the Congress
 koun hai baba?vidhansabha main pahunche is baba kaa naam raamalaal he, jo kii chhattisgarh ke champa jaanjgir jile ke rahane vaale hai
 He is said to be an active BJP worker and also a temple priest
 raamalaal ko gale main dheron maalaaen or haathon kii sabhi ungaliyon main kai anguuthiyaan pahanane kaa shauk he
 He often wears red tika and saffron robes on his forehead
 bataaya yah bhi jaataa he ki unke gale main pattharon or nagon kii maalaon kaa bhaar 10 kilo ke lagbhag he
 As long as he lived in the assembly premises, the eyes of the people were on him
 tantra-mantra ke saboot saamne nahin aane se bijepi ne congress ko sikh di he ki chunavi kaam-kaaj or vikaas se jite jate he na ki tantra-mantra se
 Significantly, this is the last session of the assembly in Chhattisgarh
 iske baad rajya main vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale he
 In such a situation, the Congress has been eyeing every activity of its main rival party to get power for fifteen consecutive years
 bhale hi wo raajnneetik gatividhiyaan ho yaa phir netaaon or baabaaon kaa aagaman
 Union Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi has a deep connection with the Sultanpur Lok Sabha seat from the Bharatiya Janata Party

 At that time i left myself above God, feeling very alone
 aaj main jo itani baari kaaryakartaaon kii sena dekh rahi hum or jo unamem utsaah dikhaai pad rahaa he usase ham loksabhaa chunaav jeetenge
 Addressing the booth worker conference held at Tikona Park, he said, "with your enthusiasm and passion, we will win the Lok Sabha elections
" aapako apane hone vaale saansad ke bare main bhi jaananaa jaruri he
 Why did i win elections from Pilibhit seven times? Everyone knows that if any person came to Maneka Gandhi to ask for help, he did not return empty handed
 mujhako insaan ke alaava jaanwaron se bhi pyaar he
 'maneka Gandhi said,' i sent my son Varun Gandhi to represent Sultanpur

 film kaa naam:momdiarector:ravi udayavarstar cast:shridevi, navazuddin siddiqui, akshay khanna, adnan siddiqui, sajal ali, abhimanyu singhvadhi:2 ghanta 27 minutesrtificate:u / a reating: 3 star'mom' shridevi kii 300veen film he
 Almost fifty years of Sridevi's career have also been completed
 maa ke majboot kirdaar ko ek arase se kai filmon ke main dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 Such as Mother India, Maa or the recently released Raveena Tandon starrer 'matru'
 kya 'english winglish' jaisaa hi welcome is film ko bhi milegaa? kya ek baar phir se hawa hawaii girl ko alag avatar main saraahaa jayega? aakhir kisi bani he yah film aaie film kii samiksha karte hai
 Paresh Rawal's 'guest in London' story borrows in the name of comedy: The story begins with a school
 skool main devaki (shridevi) teacher hai
 Devaki's step-daughter Arya (sajal Ali) also teaches in the same school
 aryaa ke saath padhane vaala ek student mohit, aryaa ko ashleel miseges bhejtaa he
 Devaki gets angry with this and punishes Mohit
 aryaa apni sauteli maa se bilkul bhi pyaar nahin karti, jabaki devaki ko apni beti se bahut pyaar he
 Mohit at Valentines Day's party rapes Arya and throws her in the gutter
 uske baad court main cese jaataa he or jeet mohit kii hoti he
 Seeing such justice, Devki goes to a detective Dayashankar Kapoor alias DK (nawazuddin Siddiqui) for help
 isi bich police afasar mathew francis (akshay khanna) kii entry hoti he
 Twist turns occur in the story
 kya aryaa ke aropiyon ko sajaa mil paati he? kya devaki apane mansoobon main kaamyaab ho paati he? kaise kahani ko anjaam miltaa he, iskaa pataa aapako film dekhakar hi chal paaegaa
 Why see the film: The story of the film is not new but the way of serving it is new
 kai saare utaar-chadhaavon ko acchhee tarah se dikhaaya gaya he
 The screenplay of the film is quite crisp
 mudda nayaa nahin he lekin us mudde kii taraf darshakon kaa dhyaan jarur jayega
 Director Ravi Udayavar has good cinematography as well as direction
 shridevi kii acting bahut acchhee he or bahut hi umdaa tarah se unhone devaki kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 He played the character of responsible mother and wife very well
 iske saath-saath navazuddin siddiqui ek baar phir se sarprise karte hue najar aate hai
 Nawaz's look and tone are interesting
 akshay khanna kii bhoomika gajab or dilachasp he
 Sajal Ali's work is commendable
 abhimanyu singh kaa kaam bhi acha he
 The film is good in terms of acting
 film ke kai imotional seens hai, jo ankhon main nami bhi laate hai
 Especially the scenes of Sridevi and Sajal
 film ke hisaab se becoground score or loketions behtareen hai
 Weak Links: The story could have been done better
 film kaa sangeet kuch khaas nahin he
 The song in the second half was weakening the pace of the film
 film kaa clymex or zyada behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 In the first and second half, the story also drags, due to which your attention starts to move away from the screen towards your phone and the people around you
 'english winglish' main jis tarah se shridevi ne sabko sarprise kiya tha, waisi ummid is film se bhi kii ja rahi thi
 But it is quite a predictable film
 box offis :film kaa bajet lagbhag 40 karod (30 karod production or 10 karod promoshan) he or ise lagbhag 1200 - 1400 screens main relies kiya jayega
 Apart from Hindi, it is also going to be released in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam languages

 Don't think of student leaders just coming into politics and becoming mlas, aps, leadership is required in all fields
 jepi, gandhi or vinoba bhaave ne chunaav lade bina bhi desh ko netritv pradaan kiya
 Modi said that the student and student movement have played an important role in the major political change in the country and the world
 chaatr andolan ke kaaran hi 1967 main desh ke 9 rajyon main gaiyrcongressi sarkaar bani
 The student movement, started in 1974 under the leadership of JPK, later became a mass movement and culminated in 1977 as a change of power
 pehali baar desh main morarji desai ke netritv mengaiyr congressisarkaar kaa gathan hua
 He appealed to the elected student leaders that the movement is no longer the age
 keval sangharsh nahin rachanaatmak kaary bhi karen
 In the student union elections, more than 90 percent of ABVP students have been elected
 ummid he ki jis tarah se 1974 main rashtravaadi chaatrashakti ne mahangaai, berogari, bhrashtachar or shiksha main sudhaar ke mudde par andolan shuru kar 1975 se apatkaal kaa muqabla kiya

 Union Minister Gopinath Munde left home to take a flight to Mumbai on Tuesday morning
 lekin kismat kaa khel dekhie wo shaam ko puure rajkeey sammaan ke saath inyidan air force ke khaas vimaan se mumbai le jaae gaye, kyonki munde dilli main apane sarkari ghar se erpopert pahunch pate usase pehle hi ek sadak haadase ne unki jaan le lee
 All this happened in 60 minutes
 jindagi or maut ke bich kaa aakhri 60 minute
 Gopinath Munde was going to Mumbai for the first time after becoming Union Minister
 vahaan unhen apane hi swaagat samaaroh main shariq hona tha
 After attending the ceremony, he was to return to Delhi by night, as the Lok Sabha session is starting from June 4
 mumbai jane ke liye gopinath munde apane sarkari nivas 21 lodhi state se subah kareeb chah baj kar 12 minute par safed rang kii sarkari gaadi eseks-4 (DL8CBF 0034) par ghar se nikle the
 The car driver was driving
 munde car kii pichhali seat par bain taraf baithe the, jabaki aage driver ke saath unka pie baitha tha
 It was 6 in the morning 20 minutes in the morning
 kaayade se gopinath munde aadhe ghante ke andar apane ghar se airport pahunt jate
 21 About eight minutes after leaving Lodhi State from his official residence, Munde's car arrives at Prithviraj road-tughlaq Road intersection, Aurobindo Road
 intersection par gadiyon kii jyaad bheed nahin thi, lekin trephic signal kaam kar rahaa tha
 As soon as Munde's car reaches this intersection, suddenly an Indica car (DL7CE 5459) arrives from the left and collides with Munde's car from the left side
 takkar usee daravaaje se hoti he, jis ore munde baithe the
 At that time, Munde was reading a newspaper sitting in a car
 takkar hote hi munde ke haathon se akhbaar chhot jaataa he or unka cheharaa or naak driver ke bagal vaali seat ke pichley hisse se ja takaraata he
 Suddenly Munde's health worsens as soon as the collision occurs
 wo fouran pie se pani maangate hai
 After drinking water, all he says is take me to the hospital
 iske baad wo behosh ho jate hai
 Seeing Munde's condition, both the PA and the driver get nervous and turn the car towards Safdarjung Road
 subah 6 bajkar 30 minutedas minute ke andar gopinath munde ames troma centre pahunch jate hai
 When the doctors see him, it is known that he is not breathing, nor pulse, nor blood pressure and even the heart was not beating
 doctoron kii team ne iske baad turant seepiaar ke jariye unki haalat sudhaarney kii koshish kii
 CPR means cardio pulmonary resection
 ye koshish agle 50 minute tak jari rahi
 Attempts by doctors at 7: 20 in the morning failed
 subah thik 7 bajkar 20 minute par doctoron ne gopinath munde ko mrit qaraar de diya
 According to the doctors, Munde died on the way before coming to the hospital
 kaise hua haadasa? kiski thi galati?dilli police kaa kahana he ki galati indica ke driver kii he
 He was driving a car at high speed
 lekin police sutron kii maane to donon driveron se poochtacha ke baad jo sach saamne aayaa he wo yah ki accident gopinath munde ke driver kii galati kii vajah se hua
 Munde's driver jumped the red light and this is what caused the accident
 police sutron ke mutabik kendriya mantri munde kii car jab prithviraj road-tughlaq road chauraahey par pahunchi tab batti laal thi
 That is, Munde's car was supposed to stop there, but Munde's driver pushed the car forward instead of stopping it
 us vakt car 60 se 70 kilometre prati ghanta kii raftaar se daud rahi thi
 At the same time, an Indica car was coming from Safdarjung's side
 batti hari thi lihaaja driver ne car aage badha di
 But on the circle, Munde's car suddenly appeared from the right side of Indica
 police sutron ke mutabik indica ke driver ne puri takat se brake maari, lekin car ghiste hue jaakar munde kii car se takaraa gai
 As soon as the collision, the driver of the Indica stopped the car and landed
 munde kaa driver bhi baahar aayaa
 Till then the driver of Indica was not aware that the Union Minister was sitting in the car
 lekin laal batti se usne andaja laga liya tha
 The driver of Indica only called the police control room at number 100
 haadase kii jaankaree di or bataaya ki car main laal batti lagi he
 According to police sources, Gopinath Munde's health was deteriorating after the accident, so at his behest, the driver took him to AIIMS immediately, while the driver of Indica stood on the spot
 baad main police jab maukey par pahunchi to driver or car ko tughlaq road thane le ai
 Later Indika's driver Gurinder was produced by the police in the court from where he was released on bail
 indica ke driver ne adaalat main bhi kaha ki red lite munde ke driver ne jump kiya tha
 After all how did Munde die? This question is because after the accident no external marks of injury were found on Munde's body
 shuruuaat main kaha gaya liver fatne kii vajah se maut hui he
 Then there was talk of a heart attack
 iske baad shaam hote-hote kendriya swasthya mantri dow
 Harshvardhan said that Munde's neck was fractured due to a tremendous blow in the accident
 haadase main shaamil donon kaaron ko dekh kar andaja nahin hota ki isse car main baithe logon ko koi gambhir chot lagi hogi
 Anyway, except Gopinath Munde, the other three riders in both have not been hurt
 ames ke doctoron kii maane to munde jis vakt ames trama centre main laae gaye the tab unki saans, dhadkan, nabj kuch bhi kaam nahin kar rahaa tha
 That is, according to this, Munde died immediately after the accident
 gopinath munde diabetes ke marij the
 According to doctors, Munde's head, face and neck were injured when the car collided
 swasthy mantri dow
 Harshvardhan says that in the initial investigation it seems that due to the tremendous shock, some bone of the neck was broken
 lekin sawaal ye he ki tuuti gardan ke saath kya koi pani pi saktaa he? kyonki munde ke pie or driver ke bayaan ke hisaab se haadase ke baad munde ne pani maang kar piya tha
 Was Munde's liver damaged due to the accident and died due to internal bleeding? If AIIMS doctors believe this may be one reason
 iske alaava doctor is baat se bhi inkaar nahin kar rahe hai ki maut kii vajah heart atake bhi ho sakati he
 The post mortem report is expected to come on Wednesday

 The world saw Dhoni's boom for the first time on this ground
 yaheen par 4 damdaar chhakkon or 15 chaukon ke saath dhoni ne thoka tha apana pehla van-de shatak
 The experience of playing on this ground in the current team is only for select players but would like to remember those big innings from Sehwag to Raina and Virat which was memorable for the team

 The field is also lucky and Team India's victory is also running fast, but will only Team India win
 westeindies kii taiyaari dekhen to is sawaal kaa jawaab he naa
 Everyone has seen how the West Indies pace battery in Cuttack sounded an alarm for Team India
 bharat main ek jeet ke liye taras rahe carabian gendbaazon ko agar vishakhapattanam main thodaa bhi mauka mila to ve vanade series main clin sweep ke armaanon par pani pher sakate hai
 To deal with West Indies fast bowlers Keymer Roach and Andre Russell, Team India batsmen will have to devise a special strategy
 katak main inhen donon ne team india ke top order kaa bantaadhaar kiya tha
 To win in Visakhapatnam, it is important that Team India's bowlers do not let the West Indies batsmen loose their screws
 westeindies kii team main dwen bravo shandaar form main hai, to vahiin kiron pollard bhi hai, jinaki dhuandhar batting ek-do over main hi match kaa rukh mode sakati he
 The batting track has been prepared for the second ODI of india-west Indies, every time teams have crossed the 250 mark in the matches played on this ground, and this time also the curator says that it will be rainy
 vishakhapattanam vanade ke liye team india kii plaing ilevan main badlaav ke asaar nahin he, team management vining combination ke saath chhedchhad karne ke mood main nahin he
 Rohit Sharma has vowed never to repeat the mistake made in Cuttack
 pehle vanade main 72 ran kii pari khilne vaale rohit ne jeet ke behad kareeb pahunch kar apana wicket ganvaa diya tha
 He says that he got a big lesson from this mistake
 katak ke baad vishakhapatanam main bhi team india kii jeet ko rokna behad mushkil he
 This is to say the desperate captain of the West Indies, Darren Sammy
 saimi ne kaha ki unako samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki itani baar jeet ke kareeb pahunchne ke baavjood unki team ko is daure par ab tak ek bhi kamyaabi kyon nahin hasil hui he
 Rain on the Visakhapatnam ODI can disrupt as drizzle is forecast for the next three days
 is maukey par stadium ke khachaakhach bharaa hone kii ummid he
 Team India won in Cuttack, but overconfidence frightened many times and also increased tension
 transgenders ke adhikaron kii raksha ke liye sansad main transgender persons (protection of raitus) bill 2019 paarit ho gaya
 So , what relief has the long-suffering transgender community been fighting for rights ? Will the transgender community now be able to live a respectable life with rights? Grace Banu, who agitated for the interests of the transgender community, termed the day of passing of the bill as 'gender Justice Murder Day'
 gres or gusse main bolte hai, yah vidheyak trans samudaay kii hatya karne vaala he, ummid thi ki sarkaar is samudaay ke hit ke liye kanoon or yojanaayen banaaegi
 But this bill brought in the name of protecting the rights of the trans community is a 'huge fraud'
 public health doctor or transgender samudaay ke saath najdiki se kaam kar chuki silvia karpegam kii maane to bina gahari charchaa ke is vidheyak ko paas kar diya gaya
 She objected to 4 provisions
 isvidheyak ke duusare number 'bhedbhaav ke khilaaf nishedh'kii samiksha karti hai
 "this provision says that any discrimination in education, employment, health services, public place, right to movement, right to property or right to rent means discrimination in fundamental rights with the person of this community
" Prohibits against
 lekin sakaaratmak sweekaaryata (positive afrmeshan) nahin dikhataa he
 There should have been talk of participation in politics which is not there in this bill
 teesraa praavdhanabhi dikkaton bharaa he, ''yah kahata he ki agar trans samudaay ke vyakti kaa parivaar uski dekhbhaal karne main sakasham nahin he to phir use purnavas (rihabilitation) centre main rakhaa jayega
 "this provision is completely contrary to the spirit of the trans community
" yah log apane samudaay ke bich main rahanaa chaahate hai
 Or many people also want to be 'independent' like others
 sarkaar ko chahie ki unhen swatantra rup se rahane main madad kare
 The pathetic condition of rehabilitation centers in our country is not hidden from anyone
 vidheyak kaa chatha praavdhanto bhedbhaav ko badhaane vaala he
 "it has been said that separate transgender community should be provided with separate HIV surveillance and gender change system
 '' dow
 It is like promoting it rather than reducing discrimination, says Sylvia
 inke liye alag se vyavastha kyon? kya duusare samudaay ke logon ke saath inkaa ilaaj nahin ho saktaa? philhal abhi swasthya seva karmi yaa doctor inaki kisi bhi beemaari ke ilaaj ke dauraan inaki youniktaa or gender se jude sawaal poochhate hai
 They have to answer questions related to sex life even when they have a cold
 swasthya seva karmiyon ko 'gender' kii training dekar is samudaay ke prati bhedbhaav kii bhaavana khatm karne kii koshish kerani chahie
 The seventh provision of the bill is completely contrary to the demand of the transgender community
 iske mutabik transgender samudaay ke logon ko gender ke box main transgender likhaa pahchaan pramaan patr magistrate se banvaanaa padegaa
 If a person wants to change 'gender' in the certificate, then it will change the same person who has undergone sex change surgery
 lekin praavdhaan transgender samudaay kii dikkaton ko badhaane vaala he
 There should be a provision for the transgender community to self-identify, ie transgender person can certify their gender themselves
 kai baar bina surgery karaae bhi trans vyakti janmajaat lingagat pahchaan se alag vah khud ko kisi anya gender kii pahchaan ke saath sahaj mahasoos karata he
 So the question arises as to how such a person will get the certificate? Overall, there is anger among the transgender community about this bill brought with the claim of protecting the interests of the transgender community

 *** dilli main bijli ke daam ko lekar aam aadmi party kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar or bijli companiyaan khule taur par aamane-saamne aa gai hai
 On the one hand, while Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal is assuring the people of Delhi that the electricity rates in all the slots will be halved, on the other hand, the power companies have said that electricity rates in the metropolis will have to be increased
 unhone aagaah kiya he ki agar aise halaat rahe to unka kaam-kaaj thap ho jayega
 This means that electricity will fail in Delhi
 samachar patron kii report ke mutabik, dilli kii bijli vitaran companiyon ne kejariwal sarkaar ko kah diya he ki unke paas bijli utpaadak companiyon se bijli kharidne ke liye paise nahin hai or bank bhi unhen lone dene ko icchhuk nahin hai
 Anil Ambani's company Reliance has made it clear that they are facing financial difficulties and the attitude of the new government is not cooperative
 dilli ke pawar secretary punit goyal ko reliance ne is aashay kii chitthee bhej di he
 It states that electricity rates are such that the condition of BSES is deteriorating
 isse bijli companiyon ko paise dene kii hamaari kshamta par asar padataa ja rahaa he
 If the claim of the power companies is correct, then it will mean a big power problem in Delhi, because these companies will not be able to pay the power producers
 bisies ne yah bhi kaha he ki bank hamaare paise lautaane kii kshamta par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 It seems from the media reports that the government wants to reduce electricity rates
 isse ve or bhi hamase dur ho gaye hai
 They are saying that they will not be able to lend us further

 Delhi's problem is that it generates only 1,935 MW of power while central government companies provide 5,441 MW of power to it
 dilli kii kul jarurat 7,500 megawatt kii he
 The power companies have made it clear that they follow the orders of the Electricity Regulator of Delhi and its order will have to be accepted by the government

 Hearing on which the High Court on Monday ordered the government and police to provide adequate security
 court ne donon ke vivaah ko vaidhanik qaraar dete hue do maah ke andar upi marij shaadi kaa registration karaane kaa aadesh diya
 The High Court also said that if the marriage is not registered within the stipulated period, then the order will automatically be nullified
 hoicourt se donon ko tatkaal suraksha to mil gai, lekin ek sawaal unke saamne bhi munh baae khadaa hoga ki ab kya?bhay ke saae main jis jindagi se ajiz aakar is jode ne video viral kiya, media kaa sahaara liya, suraksha ke liye hoicourt gaye, kya isse ab puri tarah nijaat mil jayega ? is sawaal se vah swayan bhi waakif hai, tabhi to ajitesh ne bhi ek tivi ko die intervyuu main kaha tha ki yah suraksha taumr nahin rahane vaali
 Ajitesh was also assaulted while leaving the court after hearing a petition filed for demand for security while leaving the High Court
 yah ghatana tab hui, jab suraksha ke liye police bhi maujuud thi
 The police are denying the incident of the assault, but according to reports, after the incident, both were seated in the registrar's room in the court itself
 hoicourt ke nirdesh par police donon ko kadi suraksha ke bich get number do se bamrauli airport le gai
 Both were taken by helicopter to an undisclosed location from Bamrauli Airport
 navvivaahit premi jode ko hoicourt ke aadesh par tatkaal suraksha to mil gai, lekin aage kii raah aasaan nahin
 The path of this love couple of Bareilly is going to be challenging
 police kii maujuudagi main is tarah kii ghatana yah bataati he ki ajitesh kii ashanka nirmul nahin
 Registration of marriage will also be challenging, for this couple it will be challenging to register the marriage within two months as per the court order
 maamle ke media main uchhalane ke baad sakshi ke pita rajesh mishra urf pappu bhartaul bhale hi kuch na kahen, kuch na karen, lekin vah sattadhari dal ke hai
 There may also be obstacles in the way of registration of the marriage of the daughter of the ruling party MLA
 hoicourt ne is sambandh main adhikariyon ko koi nirdesh bhi nahin die hai
 On the other hand the state government is also neutral
 mukhyamantri ne maangi report, lekin vidhayakon kii chating parmukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne is maamle main report jarur talab kii he, lekin sakshi or ajitesh kii shaadi yaa inaki suraksha par nahin
 The Chief Minister has summoned the report showing the seriousness of the screenshot of the alleged chatting between his own party MLA Shyam Prakash and Pappu Bharatol
 iske peeche raajnneetik sajeesh kii ashanka jataai ja rahi he
 It is also clear that the government wants to be neutral on this matter

 a team of Bareilly police came to Delhi for the safety of both and took them to Prayagraj for hearing the petition filed in Allahabad High Court
 bharat main shaadiyaan kisi tyohaar se kam nahin hoti hai
 While there are new births taking place in the mind of the girl about marriage, many types of doubts keep popping up in her mind
 ladki ko kai tarah ke reeti-rivaaj nibhaane hote hai
 After seven rounds, she goes to another house and from here, a new beginning of her life is also made
 hamaare desh main kaha jaataa he ki jodiyaan upar se banakar aati hai
 But in a new house everything is new for the girl
 use bahut si chizon ko nae sire se sanjona hota he
 There are many things that happen to him for the first time
 ye wo baaten hai jinase zyaadaatar mahilaon ko guzarana padaa he
 In such a situation, if you are going to get married very soon, then it is possible that you too had to be two-four with these things
 1
 You wake up late in your house at the time of waking up, but in this new house people expect you to wake up early
 zyaadaatar ladakiyon ke liye subah jaldi uthanaa ek bahut badi samasya hoti he
 Although you may find it difficult to get up early in the morning, but by getting up on time, you will have enough time to tackle other things
 2
 What not to wear or not
 This is a problem that every girl struggles with throughout her life and now is the first day after marriage
 shaadi ke agle din kya pahananaa chahie or kya nahin, ye tay kar paanaa har ladki ke liye bahut mushkil hota he
 It is better that you prepare the clothes that you have to wear the next day before the wedding
 3
 First meal: You have to cook on the first day
 is baat kii chintaa aksar ladakiyon ko pareshaan karti he
 They think that if food becomes bad then what people will think about it
 par aisa nahin he
 Do the work with confidence
 sab kuch acha hi hoga
 4
 saas-sasur kaa pyarhar ladki ke liye yah ek bahut bada dar hota he ki uske saas-sasur use pasand karenge yaa nahin
 But it is not a matter of panic
 aapako sirf sahaj rahane kii jarurat he, baaki chijen khud-ba-khud ho jaaengi
 Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has said that to overcome poverty and unemployment, the government will have to pay more attention to the development of rural areas
 guwahati ke sameep kahikuchi main kal mahilaon ke liye ek chatravaas or atithigrih ke udghaatan samaaroh main gogoi ne kaha ki garibi unmoolan kaa ek or tarika gramin ilaakon ke yuvaaon ko avasar muhaiyaa karana he
 He said that in the past, the youth of rural areas were unable to get safe benefits given for employment and other related issues
 haalia varshon main hamaari sarkaar ne rojgaar ke srijan tathaa swarozgaar ke liye kai kaarykram shuru kiye hai
 The Chief Minister said that this step has been taken to strengthen the Panchayati Raj system in Assam for the development of rural areas
 unhone kaha ‘mahila adhikarita ke kshetra main swasahayta samoohon se judi mahilaon ke kaaran rajya kii arthvyavastha main vyapak parivartan aayaa he
 The government is working to promote the skill development of women
 ’gogoi ne kaha ki nae paathyakram shuru karne honge taaki mahilaon or yuvaaon ko aisa kaushal prashikshan diya ja sake jo aaj kii bazaar sanchalit arthvyavastha main praasangik ho

 Former Solicitor General Gopal Subramaniam has refused to partake in this task
 unhen supreme court ne emics curi yani adaalat kaa mitra banaaya tha or khajaane ke bare main tamaam tarah kii report dene ko kaha tha
 It is said that Subramaniam is upset about why he was not promoted and made a judge of the Supreme Court
 buudhvaar ko unhone bina koi kaaran bataae chif justise aaram lodha ko apana istipha bhej diya
 It is said that the government had raised the voice against making him a judge of the Supreme Court, after which he did not withdraw his claim but also said that he will not practice there as long as Justice Lodha will be the Chief Justice
 vah chif justise ke ravaiye se naaraaz hai
 Subramaniam gave his report to the court in March and in that he told how the royal family is stealing gold from the treasury there
 unka aarope tha ki 26 kilo sona jisaki keemat 65 karod rupee he, vahaan se gaayab he
 The court has ordered its investigation

 madhya pradesh ke vanabhoomi vaale mandla jile ke gond adivasee bahul teen gaanvon ke log prastaavit chutka parmaanu sanyantr ko shuru karne ke centre sarkaar ke prastaavon kaa datakar virodh kar rahe hai
 About 600 families of Chutka, Tatighat and Patha villages say that according to the Fifth Schedule of the constitution, it is mandatory to get the permission of the gram sabhas of those villages before the acquisition of the land of the tribals, but no permission was taken in this case
 visthapit graminon ko mandla ke paas gaunjhi jaakar basna hoga
 However, the administration says that the villagers were duly negotiated and the gram sabhas had given permission in this context only in 2009
 lekin jaisaa ki chutka nivasee dadulal kudaape bataate hai, ''2009 main gram sabha main kai prastaav paarit kiye gaye the
 We were not even told anything about these proposals

 Now also know what a nearby shopkeeper claimed- 'there was no cleaning here for three days, Yogi Ji will come and clean it, he was collecting garbage for this, otherwise it is cleaned here in the evening

 Shyamchand was shining on his face, and Shyamchand was sweeping on the broom, shaking shoulder to shoulder with the Chief Minister

 The beating of mediamen was also increasing

 Yogi's master stroke brought him to close up with a long shot

 Some, like Shyam Chand, became completely prostrate in the excitement of sweeping

 It is worth noting that in this meeting, a surprising picture was also seen that Gurpreet Ghuggi, the Convenor of Aam Aadmi Party, also joined this meeting, although Gurpreet Ghuggi made it clear that he was not as a politician but an artist in this meeting Have joined navjot singh siddhu kii taraf se bhi unako ek kalakaar ke taur par hi inwit bheja gaya tha
 After this meeting, many artists praised Navjot Singh Sidhu's initiative to formulate a new cultural policy and said that he has put his suggestions before the minister
 ab wo sujhaavon ke aadhaar par punjab kii nai cultural policy taiyaar karenge
 In fact, Navjot Singh Sidhu wants to show his opponents that he is very aggressive about working for Punjab as a minister and that is why he continues to hold meetings about the work of his ministries even on holiday
 bajirao mastaani or dilavaale kii tuuti desh videsh main gunj rahi he
 The audience is happy with the films and the collection at the box office is increasing, so of course the producers and directors are also happy
 dono filmein desh videsh main acha kaarobaar kar rahi hai
 However Dilwale is still ahead of Bajirao Mastani in relation to collection
 dilavaale ne duniya bhar me ab tak 273
 5 crores and Bajirao Mastani has earned 188
 19 karod rupee
 The thing to be noted here is whether both these films will prove to be a source of profit by removing their costs
 bajirao mastaani or dilavaale, in donon hi filmon kaa bajet kareeb 140 karod rupee ke aas-paas he or agar brands windo yani vah paisa jo film main istemaal kiye gaye products ke prachaar se kamaaya jaataa he, use chhod den or satellite ritis ko bhi alag kar den to dono filmon ko cinemagharon se apni laagat nikaalane ke liye kareeb 280 karod kamaane kii zarurat he
 Now, if we talk about Dilwale, then there was a lot of space in the brand window and it is obvious that a settled business man like actor Shah Rukh would have saved the film from any risk by using it
 vaise bhi yah film abhi acha kaarobaar kar rahi he, jo ki aane vaale dinon main chutteeyon ke kii vajah se badhegaa hi
 Apart from this, the music of the film is also a big hit and in such a situation the film would have benefited a lot from music rights
 tippaniyan On the other hand, when it comes to Bajirao Mastani, this film lags behind in terms of brand window, because you cannot promote any product in it because it is a period film
 brands windo ke zarie mila paisa ek badi raashi hoti he, masalan agar ham krish 3 kii baat karen to kareeb 100 karod is film ne sirf brands windo ke zarie kamaaye the, jo ki ek badi raashi he
 Now it remains to be seen that which film in terms of overall earnings wins, Dilwale or Bajirao Mastani? If you look at all the figures, it is visible in the benefits of the heart
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki kya ye donon filme apni laagat nikaal kar faayde kaa soda sabit hongi
 Bajirao Mastani and Dilwale, both of these films have a budget of around 140 crores and if the brand window i
e
 the money that is earned from the promotion of the products used in the film, leave it and satellite rights are also different
 If done, both films need to earn around 280 crores to extract their cost from theaters
 ab agar baat karen dilavaale kii, to usamen brands windo kii kaafii jagah thi or zaahir he abhinayta shahrukh jaise sulajhe hue bijnes main ne iskaa istemaal karke film ko kisi bhi risk se bachaaya hoga
 Anyway, this film is still doing good business, which will only increase due to holidays in the coming days
 iske alaava film kaa sangeet bhi kaaphi hit he or aise main music ritis se bhi film ko khaasaa munafa hua hoga
 The comments duusari taraf bajirao mastaani kii baat karen to yah film brands windo ke maamle main pichad gai, kyonki period film hone ke kaaran isamen aap kisi product kaa prachaar nahin kar sakate
 The money received through the brand window is a huge amount, for example, if we talk about Krrish 3, then this film earned around 100 crores only through the brand window, which is a big amount
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki kul milakar kamai ke maamle main koun si film baazi maarthi he, dilavaale yaa bajirao mastaani? saare aankade dekhen to abhi dilavaale faayde main nazar aa rahi he

 During the voting, 125 votes were cast in favor of the bill and only 99 votes against it
 jiske baad rajyasabha main yah aitihaasik bill paas ho gaya
 Now the Citizenship Amendment Bill has been approved by both houses of Parliament
 iske baad vidheyak par raashtrapati ke hastakshar ke baad yah kanoon ban jayega
 But before that, the bill is being prepared to challenge the court
 congress ne die court jane ke sanketasansad ke donon sadanon main naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak paas ho jane ke baad bhi congress haar maanane vaali nahin he
 After heavily opposing the bill in Parliament, Congress is now preparing to take this bill to court

 For this we not only approached the leaders of various parties, but also assured them what the implications of this dangerous bill are

 moulana madani ne kaha ki is bill kaa puraa masauda dharmik bhedbhaav or purvaagrah ke aadhaar par taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Now be careful who submits fake bills for reimbursement
 akalan varsh 2019-20 ke liye iskar adhikari ab inakam statement se jude rimorsment or bhatton ke liye poochtacha kar sakate hai
 Those doing this can now also get a tax notice to give false information about income
 kanvence bill, makaan kiraaya bhatta (HRA) or avkaash yatra bhatta (LTA) ke liye farji tex ghoshnaa daakhil karne par aisi naubat aa sakati he
 In fact, some taxpayers are filing false information to get tax exemption from their employers with the help of fake bills
 khaas taur par HRA or LTA ke liye aisa kiya jaataa he
 a high-ranking tax official told India Today on condition of anonymity, 'the new Income Tax Return (ITR) form will help in identifying such cases through computer-based processing
 kuch karmchaariyon ne shahar main apana makaan hone ke baavjood HRA ke liye daawa kiya he
 The new ITR form will have a drop down column
 jahaan karadaataaon ko bhatton ko lekar vishisht jaankaree deni hogi
 'ITR Formchartered Accountant Manish Garg says,' Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) introduced new ITR form for assessment year 2019-20 to curb the tendency to get exemption in allowances / reimbursement through fake bills, documents is
 agar koi maamla jaanch yogya mana jaataa he to karadaata ko sabhi bill or dastavej prastut karne honge
 So that he can justify his claim to get tax exemption
 sarkaar javabdehi sunishchit karne or khaamiyon ko dur karne ke liye karadaataaon kaa jahaan tak sambhav ho sake data hasil karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Data intelligence is also an objective of the current government's income tax policy
 karadaata kii 360 degree profillingwahin sibiditi ne project insite kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya he
 One of its key objectives is to raise 360 degree profiling of the taxpayer
 nayaa itiar form isi disha main uthaaya ek kadam he
 According to Shailendra Kumar, managing director of tax consultant TIOL, the new ITR form will be convenient for the government when the data from GST, Registrar of Companies (roc) and CBDT are matched for mapping tax and economic activities
 karadaataaon kaa datiske alaava sarkaar ne nae itiar form main kuch or ahm badlaav bhi kiye hai
 Taxpayers will also have to provide detailed information about other source columns
 jaise ki diposits se byaaj, bachat khaataa or inakam tex rifund jari
 In this case, if you are a director of a company and you have invested in unlisted equity shares, then you will not be allowed to fill the ITR-1 form
 saath hi niyokta form 16 (selary par tids) or form 16A (anya aay par tids) vaarshik or timahi aadhaar par bharta he to form 16 or 26AS kii jaankaree adarsh taur par samaan honi chahie
 But many times the income tax information does not match on the basis of 26AS form and type 16 or 16A
 aisa yaa to niyokta yaa phir karmchaaree kii ore se di gai galat jaankaree ke kaaran hota he
 Now the tax authorities will focus on the wrong data or fake claims and check such information with the information and send a notice to the concerned taxpayer

 The Trinamool Congress chief said that the women of our country will give you a befitting reply

 varsh 1951 ke baad pehali baar ranjai final main pahunchi gujarat team ne 41 baar kii champion mumbai ko paanch wicket se haraakar pehali baar khitaab par kabza kiya
 But now a different video of RP Singh has emerged on social media, in which he is seen snatching his phone from the hand of a fan and throwing it on the ground

 Meanwhile, RP Singh returns there, snatches the phone from Fan's hand and throws it on the ground
 tippaniyan It is being told that this video is only for the final match played between Gujarat and Mumbai, but it is difficult to tell the real reason for RP Singh's anger due to the video being just nine seconds, because RP has also played internationally
 For Singh, this type of fan demand is quite common

 In fact, according to the voices heard in this video uploaded on youtube, some children are talking about taking a selfie with RP Singh, and raising hands out of the trap for security and raising the phone towards RP

 If you are also among those boys, then this news may change your perspective
 aaj kaa samay aisa nahin he jab koi bina kisi se mili chupchaap se shaadi kar le
 In today's time, people first meet each other, test them and only then decide to get married
 aise main ek baat to spasht ho jaati he ki koi bhi ladkaa kisi aisi ladki se shaadi nahin karnaa chahta he jise vah jaanata na ho
 So in such a situation, your girlfriend should be your priority because better than that you hardly know any other girl
 shaadi ek aisa jua hajisamen jeet or haar donon kii hi sambhaavna bani rahati he
 In such a situation, if you marry an unknown person, then your life can be even more colorless
 garlfriend se shaadi karne ke kuch pramukh kaaran:1
 There is some good and some evil within all of us
 hamaari achchhai to duniya ke saamne aati he lekin hamaari nakraatmakataa sabake saamne nahin aa paati he
 Maybe people who are very special to you when they come to know about your negative form, then they will leave you but your girlfriend is the only person who stands with you in every situation and both of your forms are equally Accepts
 aise main usase behatar jivan saathi kya koi or ho saktaa he!2
 Your girlfriend is the one who handles your every look equally
 chaahe koi bhi sthiti ho, vah aapke saath bani rahati he
 The idea of marrying a girlfriend is also welcome because she understands your every mood and every behavior and knows how to handle it

 The better your girlfriend understands you, the better you will understand her
 aise main ye aapke liye ek acchhee baat he ki aapako dobaaraa se kisi shaks ko samajhane kii koshish nahin kerani padegi
 Maybe making someone else a life partner does not harmonize with him or your behavior
 aise main behatar yahi hoga ki aap apni garlfriend ko hi jeevansangini banaaen
 It is possible that by doing this many small problems in your life can be overcome by themselves

 He has changed his political allegiance once more and has once again joined the Congress in the absence of Lok Sabha ticket from BJP, his grandson Ashray Sharma
 unhone ek ore bhaajapa ko jhatka diya he to congress phir unhen apnaane ko majaboor hui he
 Apparently, this is at least a lesson for the BJP, who, despite the displeasure of the people associated with the organization, gave ticket to Sukhram's son Anil Sharma in the last assembly elections and made him a minister again
 sukhram ke aagaman se congress main bhi asahaj sthiti ho gai he kyonki purv mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke saath unke rishte thik nahin rahe hai
 Actually, this fight is about Mandi parliamentary seat
 is seat par paramparaagat raja-rajavaadon ke vansh kaa kabja rahaa he
 Virbhadra Singh, the king of the state of Bushehr and a six-time chief minister, has been an MP from here or his wife Pratibha Singh
 yaheen se kullu riyasat ke maheshwar singh bhi bhaajapa ke saansad rah chuke hai
 Mandi is the home turf of bjp's current Chief Minister Jairam Thakur
 ek baar jab is seat par upachunaav hua tha to rajput tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue jairam thakur ko chunaav ladaaya gaya
 But then Pratibha won the election as Virbhadra was the Chief Minister in the state
 vahiin, sukhram ne brahman ke taur par chunaav ladaa tha
 During the occupation of Mandi, there was a trance between Virabhadra and Sukhram
 tab sukhram ne alag party, himachal vikaas congress bana lee thi
 It was he who formed the first coalition government in the state in 1997 in collaboration with the BJP
 tab bhaajapa netaa prem kumaar dhumal mukhyamantri the
 Sukhram again joined hands with the Congress in 2004 after being with the BJP for five years
 tab loksabhaa main sukhram kii party ko ek seat mili thi
 The Congress expelled Sukhram in the 2007 assembly elections
 lekin, unke bete anil sharma phir congress kaa hissaa ban gaye or 2012 main congress mantrimandal main shaamil rahe
 At the same time, when the Assembly elections were held in 2017, Anil Sharma again joined the BJP
 aashray, anil sharma ke bade bete hai, jinka vivaah cricketer gautam gambhir kii chacheri bahan se hua he
 Sukhram had insisted on seeking shelter, but Jairam Thakur and the state organization decided not to succumb to the repeated changing allegiance and stubbornness of the Sukhram family
 so aashray ko tikat nahin mila or sukhram ne sidhe congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se baat kii
 The Congress also had to find alternatives to free Veerabhadra from Mandi
 isliye virbhadra se bina puche rahul gandhi ne aashray ko tikat de diya
 In such a situation, the battle of Mandi seat has become very interesting now
 yahaan se bhaajapa saansad ramswaroop sharma bhale hi phir se ummidavaar hon, par yahaan jairam thakur kii pratishtha bhi judi he
 At the same time, Virbhadra was also looking for his son Vikramaditya Singh from here
 sukhram ke pote kii entry se unhen fark padegaa
 Outwardly Sukhram and Virbhadra may have shown unity, but the way Virabhadra praises Jairam Thakur personally, it is clear that the path of Congress is not easy

 One result of the 11-day battle fought in 1999 to expel Pakistani intruders from Kargil was that the Kargil Review Committee (KRC) had prepared a historic military reform report
 samiti ne jo sabase badi kamiyaan ujagar kii thim, unamem jang main shaamil tamaam sashastr balon or khaskar sena or vaayu sena ke bich talmail kii kami bhi thi
 a committee of the Group of Ministers set up to examine the findings of KRC had also upheld the findings in 2001 and recommended the Armed Forces to join the Ministry of Defense and appoint a Chief of Defense Staff (CDS)

 This is a very important step — without the CDS and indeed without the political care necessary to bring reforms to their conclusion, efforts to streamline the armed forces and prepare them for 21st-century battles can be fruitless and unsuccessful
 sidies sainya balon kaa ekikaran karegaa or 17 alag-alag kaman dhaanchon ko teen kaman kaa swaroop degaa—uttari kaman china ke liye, pashchimi kaman pakistan ke liye or dakshin kaman samudri kshetra ke liye
 This will not only save resources, but also increase military effectiveness

 The process of reform should be top to bottom by involving top defense organizations, in which the political leadership insists that reforms take place

 How quickly it is needed, this came to a horror on June 3, a few days after Singh took over as defense minister

 After Kargil, the efforts to modernize the forces are stuck on paper due to budget constraints, so the amount required for postponement purchases, according to the Armed Forces itself, has skyrocketed and about $ 400 billion (27 Lakh crore rupees)

 Similarly, the Air Force has prepared a requirement for modern radios, air-to-air and ground-to-air missiles, jammers and AEW & c aircraft, all of which will need to be purchased in the next few months

 a large number of the presentations that came before him, especially in the Union Budget to be presented on July 5, advocate to provide more money

 5 lakh crore rupees was needed so that necessary purchases could be made

 For example, the interim defense budget presented this February increased by 8 per cent to 3

 magar yah bhi naakaafi tha
 To understand this, one has to know that in 2018-19, 30 per cent of the money was received — 3
 71 lakh karod ru
 1 as needed
 12 lakh karod rupye kam mili the
 While Singh is sensitive to these needs and open to proposals, recently he told colleagues, "(armed forces) should not put forward such demands which we can fulfill only by breaking the stars from the sky
" '' sawaal he ki—sashastr balon ke liye naakaafi dhan par kya kiya jaae? yahaan tak ki agar nae upkarnon kii kharid ko taal diya jaataa he, tab bhi sashastr balon kaa kareeb 60 se 70 fisadi puunjigat bajet un chizon ko puraa karne main kharch ho jaataa he jinhen 'pehle se vaada kii gai dendariyaan' kaha jaataa he
 These are yearly payments that arms manufacturers have to pay for previously purchased equipment — much like automobiles and homeowners pay monthly installments annually

 Due to such issues, unauthorized boundaries have been pulled on any increase in the expenditure of the Ministry of Defense

 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj today described these reports as absurd that Congress leader Shashi Tharoor would help the Narendra Modi government in drafting a statement to be read on Kulbhushan Jadhav in Parliament
 sushamaa ne twit kar kaha, mere mantralay main pratibha kaa koi akaal nahin pad gaya he
 i have the support of very competent secretaries

 According to reports, former Minister of State for External Affairs Tharoor will help the government draft a statement of solidarity on the issue of Kulbhushan Jadhav
 khabar ke mutabik, kulbhushan jadhav ko faansee kii sajaa dene ko lekar sansad dwaara pakistan kii ninda kiye jane ke baad bayaan kaa masauda taiyaar karne kaa anurodh sushamaa swaraj se aayaa
 Jadhav, a former Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistan military court for his involvement in espionage and subversive activities
 sushamaa ne isse pehle aaj din main sansad ke donon sadanon main kaha, jadhav dwaara koi galat kaam kiye jane kaa koi sakshya nahin he
 Earlier during the discussion on the issue, Kharge said if Yadipakistan hangs Jadhav, it would be 'pre-planned murder'
 kisi ko bhi jadhav se milane kii ijaajat nahin di gai
 He was not even given a lawyer to fight his case
 kisi bhi antarrashtriya niyam kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya
 BJP leader Nishikant Dubey demanded that a resolution be passed in the House declaring Pakistan as a terrorist nation
 unhone kaha ki bharat ne aatankwaad ke mudde par pakistan ko mushkil main daal diya he or yahi vajah he ki padosi desh bhartiya ko apamaanit karne main juta he
 AIMIM member Asaduddin Owaisi said that India should do everything to save Jadhav

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said that Zaheer will not play in this match

 He is looking to improve a lot and is likely to be fit by the third Test

 We will give him some more time
 yah is par nirbhar karata he ki vah kitna dard sahane ke baavjood khel saktaa he
 Gambhir was injured during the first Test match at Matt Prior's shot
 unki dahini kohni par chot lagi thi or mana ja rahaa he ki unki kohni main ab bhi dard he or vah puri tarah feet nahin hai
 Gambhir batted at the nets though

 India has been struggling with injuries lately and Dhoni said that it rarely happened when he was able to land his strong team in Test matches
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaari team ko lagaataar is samasya se jujhna padaa he
 Whenever we play, our strongest team does not play
 aisa lagaataar ho rahaa he
 'indian batsmen scored less than 300 runs in both innings at Lord's but Dhoni is expected to improve a lot in the second Test match
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘keval ek ballebaaj ko hi nahin hamen acchhee saajhedaariyon kii jarurat he
 50 or 100 run partnerships will really help to advance the innings
 ’unhone kaha, ‘iske saath hi ballebaajon kaa apni acchhee shuruyaat ko bade score main tabdeel karnaa bhi mahatvapurn he
 The lower order batsmen also have to understand the importance of their wicket and if they score 40 to 60 runs then it will help them a lot
 ’dhoni ne kaha, ‘hamane pehle aisa kiya he or ham apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karenge
 The Indian captain said that if India wants to dominate the match, then it will have to do well in the first innings
 unhone kaha, ‘pehali pari main acha karnaa mahatvapurn hoga
 It is seen that when the team team gets 100-120 run lead then it becomes very difficult for the other team to return
 ’bharat par duniya kii number ek test team kaa darja ganvaane kaa khatra mandara rahaa he lekin dhoni ne kaha ki ve isse chintit nahin hai
 He said, 'if you enjoy the game, then the rating itself will take care of you

 No one can always remain number one

 hindi filmon ke mashhoor geetkaar shakeel badayuni ko unki filmon ke romantic or dardebhre gaanon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 This songwriter wrote many such songs for Naushad after 1944 which are still very famous
 begum akhtar ne bhi shakeel kii gajalon ko gaaya
 Pain, love and romance are the hallmarks of Shakeel's poetry
 shakeel kaa janm uttar pradesh main ruhelkhand ke ilaake badaayun main hua tha jo aaj bhi teen chizon ke liye behad mashhoor he
 This area is known for Peda, Poetry and Pir
 yah vahi ilaaka he jahaan 13veen shatabdi ke mashhoor sufi sant nizamuddin auliya kaa bhi janm hua tha

 Shakeel's journey till Mumbai's film world shows the tradition, literary heritage and wonder of Badaun
 3 agast 1916 ko badaayun main janmen shakeel ke pita mohammad jamaal ahamed kadri chaahate the ki unka betaa behatar taiyaar ho
 For this, he arranged tutoring of Arabic, Urdu, Persian and Hindi at home
 shakeel ke ghar main shaayari kaa koi maahaul nahin tha
 Yes, a distant relative of Shakeel was a religious poet
 begum akhtar: maut ke 44 saal baad 60 karod kii laagat se sangeet academy banaaegi avadh uniwarsitishkil par ghar ke maahaul se alag badaayun or rishtedaar kii shaayari kaa asar padaa
 They started doing poets
 lekin shaayar ke taur par unki pahchaan badaayun chhodane ke baad hui
 In 1936, when Shakeel reached Aligarh Muslim University for studies, he began to take part in the mushairs of colleges and universities
 1940 main salama ke saath unka nikaah ho gaya
 However, after completing graduation, Shakeel reached Delhi as a supply officer
 naukari ke baavjood unka mushaairon main janaa jari rahaa
 From the beginning Shakeel was completely different from the poets of his time
 unke samakaleen shaayar jahaan saamaajik, raajnneetik ghatnaon par likh rahe the, shakeel kii shaayari kaa vishay sirf dard or romance tha
 Shakeel's specialty is also seen in the writing of film songs
 shakeel ke hi ek sher main ise samajha ja saktaa he -main shakeel dil kaa hum tarjuma, ke mohabbaton kaa hum raajadaan,mujhe fakr he ki meri shaayari, meri jindagi se juda nahinek line ne dilaa diya filmon main kaamshkeel kareeb chaar saal tak naukari karte hue dilli main rahe
 The time in his life came during 1944 when he decided to write in films
 unhone filmi geetkaar banane ke liye naukari chodi or mumbai pahunch gaye
 Coming here, he met filmmaker AR Kedar and composer Naushad
 naushaad ne shakeel se ek line main unki poetric skill bataane ko kaha gaya
 He said- "we will tell the pain of the world to the world, i will set fire to love in every heart" Begum Akhtar, who made Ghazal her jewel, worked with Naushad for 25 years
 What happened after this is like a history in Bollywood
 shakeel or naushaad kii jodi 20 saal se zyada vakt tak saath kaam kiya or kai behtareen filmein deen
 The two worked together in films like Didar, Baiju Bawra, Mother India, mughal-e-azam, Dulari, Shabab, Ganga Jamuna and Mere Mehboob
 inke gaanon main aaj bhi romance or dard ko mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he
 Shakeel mostly worked with Naushad, but he also wrote lyrics to the tunes of several other composers
 unhone ravi or hemanth kumaar ke sangeet nirdesan main bhi kaam kiya
 Shakeel and Ravi won Filmfare for Best Lyricist and Best Composer for the song "hushnwale Tera Jawab Nahin" from the film "gharana"
 ravi ke saath shakeel kii anya mahatvapurn filmon main chaudahavi kaa chand thi
 Shakeel won the Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist in 1961 for the title song of the film
 hemanth kumaar ke saath shakeel kii sabase badi hit sahib bivi or gulam thi
 Shakeel wrote songs for around 89 films in his film career
 unhone kai aisi gazalen bhi likhin jise begum akhtar ne apni aawaaj di or wo behad mashhoor huin
 Shakeel, who wrote songs to the tune of Dosthinoushad with Naushad, later became his close friend
 shakeel se mulaaqaat ke baad 25 saal tak naushaad ne apane zyaadaatar gane shakeel se hi likhwaaye
 Baiju Bawra is the best film of both the careers which is still remembered for its lyrics and music
 haalanki film ke nirdeshak vinay bhatta isamen kavi pradeep se gaanaa likhavana chaahate the
 When Naushad came to know, he requested Vinay to listen to Shakeel's writing once
 or is tarah shakeel ko sunne ke baad vinay, naushaad kii baat par raji ho gaye
 Dilwai is 10 times more famous, another story of friendship between Fisnaushad and Shakeel
 darasal, shakeel ko tibi kii beemaari ho gai or wo ilaaj ke liye pachgani main the
 Naushad knew that his financial condition was also bad
 naushaad ne shakeel ko teen filmein dilwaai
 Let us tell that Naushad was paid 10 times more than his normal fees for these films
 naushaad ke alaava shakeel kii dosti sangeetkaar ravi or gulam mohammad ke saath bhi thi
 Shakeel died at the age of 53 while undergoing treatment at Bombay Hospital

 Despite these revolutions, the task of mobilizing support in the BCCI has always been secretive and conspiracy, where friends suddenly become enemies every election year, where the equations change very fast but the faces remain the same

 a week before this three-match one-day series, South Africa Cricket Board chief Ali Bakar telephoned the then BCCI secretary Dalmiya to ask how much would it cost to broadcast matches in South Africa? The BCCI did not know who had the broadcasting rights, with the government or with it itself
 After several rounds of talks, the BCCI assessed that the broadcast rights for the series could be sold for $ 10,000 per match, but When Biker offered to pay $ 60,000 for the entire series, Dalmiya smashed a six and stopped the deal at $ 120,000

 The bcci's policy of rescuing boards vs
 outsiders and tackling outsiders can be understood from the example of former IPL chairman Lalit Modi coming to the floor with haste

 iske chalate modi bisisiai kaa hissaa ban gaye or board ne unhen vaise hi gale laga liya jaise har navagantuk ko lagaataa rahaa he
 The general perception is that Modi's troubles started when allegations of irregularity and financial manipulation were leveled against him in 2010, but in fact his crisis began when he was in the hands of IAS officer Sanjay Dixit in a controversial RCA election
 Lost the post of dikshit ke sir par nae mukhyamantri ashok gahalot kaa haath tha
 Now Modi had become a part of bcci's internal affairs, but he did not have the franchise, so his access to it was interrupted

 'during these years Srinivasan has done a lot of work to attract big players

 Whoever remains in power, but the BCCI is so confident that it will continue its business without any problems under the patronage of those political leaders who are present on both sides of the court, who usually seek the resignation of the Prime Minister and the party presidents
 , But are so deeply entrenched within the system that they can never initiate change

 While the BJP is claiming a landslide victory ahead of the counting of votes in Uttarakhand, the state Chief Minister Harish Rawat has indicated the coalition government in the state
 ravat ne enditivi india se kaha ki ve bahut saare nirdaliyon ke ‘kaayal’ hai or agar unhen purna bahumat mil bhi gaya to vah unhen saath lenaa chahenge
 Just a day before voting, Harish Rawat predicts his victory and the defeat of exit poll results in front of journalists
 unhone kaha ‘plan bi kii zarurat nahin padegi
 'but the results of the exit poll are disappointing for the Congress and like every politician, Harish Rawat is not ready to accept the exit poll results in Uttarakhand
 ravat yah sanket bhi de rahe hai ki nirdaliyon se unki baat ho chuki he or agar kisi party ko bahumat nahin mila ko congress baahar se madad lekar sarkaar banane kii puri koshish karegi
 "we may or may not need it
" 
 
 main kah rahaa hum ki main 36 kaa aankada paar karuunga iskaa mujhe bharosa he lekin iske baavjood bhi agar koi sahi aadmi he, or vah nirdaleey ladakar jeet kar aa rahaa he to main use saath lenaa chaahunga

 Earlier, the BJP that formed the government in 2007 brought 34 seats and the Congress 21 seats, in 2007 other or independents had 14 seats
 aise main donon partiyaan jaanati hai ki choti partiyon or nirdaliyon kii ahmiyat kya he
 However, after the exit poll results, BJP leaders are saying that their party will get a strong majority

 " udhar harish ravat ne enditivi india se baatcheet main mana ki kuch siton par tikat dene main unase gadabadi hui he
 “I believe that in some seats we could field more strong candidates
 ” ravat kaa ishaara tehri or jwalapur jaisi siton ko lekar he
 While according to him there may be 'problems' for the party, but Rawat has started contact with independents to make up for it
 “rajya chalaane ke liye hamen ek vrihad saamaajik gathbandhan karnaa hoga jo like minded log hai wo chaahe uttarakhand kranti dal se hon yaa nirdaleey hon yaa koi or ho unka saath liya janaa chahie

 maine party se bhi kaha he ki aaj kii sthiti main ham kanjarvative hokar nahin soch sakate
 " haalanki exit pole nateezon ke baad bijepi netaa kah rahe hai unki party ko prachand bahumat milegaa
 BJP spokesperson and BJP candidate from Vikasnagar seat Munna Singh Chauhan says, “given the Modi wave and the way our party has exposed Congress misrule and corruption, we will get more than 50 seats
 ” On the other hand, Harish Rawat, in a conversation with NDTV India, admitted that he was wrong in giving tickets to some seats
 “main maanata hum ki kuch siton main ham or majboot ummidavaar utaar sakate the
 Rawat refers to seats like Tehri and Jwalapur
 jahaan unke mutabik party ke liye ‘dikkat’ ho sakati he, lekin ravat ne isaki bharpai ke liye nirdaliyon ke saath sampark shuru kar diya he
 “to run the state, we have to form a large social coalition who are like minded people, be it from the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal or independents or anyone else
 unako ham rope in karenge
 i have also told the party that in today's situation we cannot think as conservative

 dilli nagar nigam (emsidi) chunaav ko lekar bhartiya janata party kisi tarah kii kotahi baratane ke mood main nahin he
 It does not want to repeat the mistake of Delhi and Bihar Legislative Assembly, which is why the party has not given ticket to all its existing councilors this time, but this new bet of Bhojpuri film star Manoj Tiwari is back on the party
 pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne apane is faisle kii vajah yuvaaon ko tarjeeh dena bataaya he, lekin maujuuda parshadon ko tikat nahin milane se virodh kii awaajen uthne lagi hai, bhale hi vah dabi jubaan main hi kyon na hon! duusari taraf, party ke faisle main virodhabhas bhi dikh rahaa he
 The party has also given tickets to people over 60 years of age and has given the opportunity to speak to the opponents themselves
 emsidi chunaav ko apni naak kaa sawaal bana chuki bhaajapa shuru se hi nae chehron ko mauka dene or bhai-bhatijawad ke khilaaf jang chhedane kii baat kah rahi thi, lekin bhaajapa ummidavaaron kii suchi alag hi kahani bayaan kar rahi he
 The party has given tickets to three district heads and two district heads, including three vice presidents and a vice president's wife
 inamen bhaajapa mahila morcha kii adhyaksh punam parashar jha or purvachal morcha ke pradesh adhyaksh vipin bahaari shaamil hai
 At the same time, Rubina, daughter of bjp's current councilor Heer Bano Ismail, has been given ticket from Quraish Nagar while Vijay, nephew of MP Udit Raj from west-north Delhi, has been given ticket from Mangolpuri B-ward
 manoj tiwari ke kareebi raaj kumaar ballaan ko purvi dilli ke brahampuri se tikat diya gaya he, jabaki kendriya mantri vijay goyal ke kareebi jai prakaash jepi ko sadar bazaar se tikat diya gaya he
 Overall, the party did not give tickets to the sitting councilors, but fearing rebellious councilors rebelled and gave tickets to their relatives and put them in the election
 party ke nae daanv se maujuud parshad haalanki khush nahin hai, phir bhi anushaasan nibhaate hue ve party ke saath khadey hote dikhaai de rahe hai
 Bhupendra Mohan Bhandari, who became a councilor just nine months before winning the by-election from Shalimar's ward number 56, said, “it has been only nine months since i became a councilor
 mujhe janata ke liye kaaphi kaam karnaa tha, lekin ab pad nahin rahegaa
 Nevertheless i completely agree with the party's decision
 party ne kuch soch-samajhakar hi yah faisla liya hoga
 " vahiin, purvi dilli ke ward number 12i se parshad sandhya verma ne kaha, "party ko kam se kam un parshadon ko to tikat dena hi chahie tha, jinhone acha kaam kiya he
 Had to be cut, then the ticket of those councilors, whose record has been poor
 khayr, jo bhi ho, ham party ke faisle ke saath khadey hai
 " sangam vihaar ward number 76 se parshad madhav prasad kehete hai, "party kaa faisla sarvopari he
 The party gave me a ticket in 2007 and again in 2012
 party ne is baar tikat nahin diya to kuch soch-samajhakar hi nahin diya hoga
 The party has many activists who have been working for the party for the past several decades, but they have not got a chance till date
 main maanata hum ki sabko mauka milanaa chahie, party yuvaaon ko mauka dena chaahati he to uske faisle kaa swaagat he
 " kai maujuud parshad aise bhi hai, jo party ke faisle se sahamat nahin dikhe or unhone alag raah pakad lee
 Councilor Chander Prakash from Govindpuri held the Congress 'hand' even before the list was released by the BJP, while Councilor Krishna Gehlot from Nawada has decided to contest as an independent
 purvi dilli kii ek maujuuda mahila parshad ne bhi bataur nirdaleey chunaav ladane ke liye namakan daakhil kiya he
 Perhaps this is why the BJP released its final list just hours before the deadline for filing nominations
 vipaksh ise 'sochi-samajhi ranneeti' kah rahaa he
 An activist of the Congress's Delhi unit said, "why did the BJP release its final list just hours before the nomination? It clearly means that she does not want her councilors to have no more time to think
 " unhone kaha ki bhaajapa chunaav main yuvaaon ko tarjeeh dene kaa dhindhora peet rahi thi, lekin usne 60 saal se adhik umr ke kai logon ko tikat diya he, jisamen mayur vihaar se ummidavaar kiran vaidya or punjabi baag se kailash saankala jaise ummidavaar hai
 The comments darasal, bhaajapa par 'gujarat model' haaavee he
 The party also used the existing councilors to cut tickets in Gujarat, which was also very successful
 matdaan 23 april ko hone ja rahaa he or 26 april ko jab nateezon kii ghoshnaa hogi, tabhi pataa chalegaa ki bhaajapa kaa nayaa daanv kitna safal rahaa
 Significantly, in 2012, the MCD was divided into three parts - North Delhi Municipal Corporation, East Delhi Municipal Corporation and South Delhi Municipal Corporation
 272 sadasyeey emsidi ke daayre main uttari dilli main kul 104 ward, purvi dilli main 64 jabaki dakshini dilli main 104 ward hai
 BJP is in control of all three municipal corporations, the challenge is to return to it
 uskaa muqabla dilli main sattarudh aam aadmi party (aap) or dilli par 15 saal raaj kar chuki congress se he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The BJP, which has made the MCD election a question on its nose, was talking about giving new faces a chance from the beginning and waging war against nepotism, but the list of BJP candidates is telling a different story
 party ne pradesh ke teen upaadhyakshon or ek upaadhyaksh kii patni sahit teen jiladhyakshon or do jiladhyakshon kii patni ko tikat diya he
 These include BJP Mahila Morcha president Poonam Parashar Jha and Purvanchal Morcha state president Vipin Bahari
 vahiin, bhaajapa kii maujuuda parshad hir bano ismail kii beti rubina ko kurash nagar se tikat diya gaya he to pashchimi-uttari dilli se saansad udit raaj ke bhattije vijay ko mongolpuri bi-ward se tikat diya gaya he
 Raj Kumar Ballan, who is close to Manoj Tiwari, has been given ticket from Brahmapuri in East Delhi, while Jai Prakash JP, who is close to Union Minister Vijay Goel, has been given ticket from Sadar Bazar
 kul milakar, dekha jaae to party ne maujuuda parshadon ko tikat nahin diya, lekin dabang parshadon kii baghawat ke dar se unke sage-sambandhiyon ko tikat dekar chunaav main khadaa kar diya
 Although the councilors are not happy with the new party stakes, they are seen standing with the party, playing discipline
 shalimaar ke ward number 56 se upachunaav jitkar maatr nau maheene pehle hi parshad bane bhupender mohan bhandari ne bataaya, "mujhe parshad bane hue sirf nau maheene hi hue hai
 i had to do a lot of work for the public, but now the post will not be there
 phir bhi main party ke faisle se puri tarah se sahamat hum
 The party must have taken this decision only after some deliberation
 " At the same time, Councilor Sandhya Verma from ward number 12E of East Delhi said, "the party should have given tickets to at least those councilors who have done a good job
 kaatna hi tha to un parshadon kaa tikat kaata janaa chahie tha, jinka ricard kharaab rahaa he
 Well, whatever, we stand with the party's decision
 " Councilor Madhav Prasad from Sangam Vihar ward number 76 says, "the party's decision is paramount
 party ne mujhe 2007 or phir 2012 main tikat diya tha
 If the party did not give the ticket this time, it would not have given it thoughtfully
 party ne aise kai kaaryakarta hai jo pichley kai dashakon se party ke liye kaam kar rahe hai, lekin unhen aaj tak mauka nahin mila
 i believe that everyone should get a chance, if the party wants to give a chance to the youth, its decision is welcome
 " There are many councilors present who do not seem to agree with the party's decision and they took a different route
 govindpuri se parshad chander prakaash ne bhaajapa kii ore se suchi jari kiye jane se pehle hi congress kaa 'haath' tham liya, jabaki navada se parshad krishna gahalot ne bataur nirdaleey chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 a sitting woman councilor from East Delhi has also filed nomination to contest as an independent
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi ki bhaajapa ne namakan daakhil karne kii aakhri samay-seemaa se kuch hi ghante pehle apni aakhri suchi jari kii
 The opposition is calling it a 'thought-out strategy'
 congress kii dilli ikai ke ek kaaryakarta ne kaha, "bhaajapa ne aakhir namakan se kuch hi ghante pehle apni aakhri suchi jari kyon kii? iskaa saaf matlab he ki vah nahin chaahati ki unke parshadon ko sochane kaa kuch or samay na mili
 "he said that the BJP was beating up the preference for the youth in the elections, but it has given tickets to many people over the age of 60, with candidates like Kiran Vaidya from Mayur Vihar and Kailash Sankla from Punjabi Bagh
 tippaniyan Actually, the 'gujarat model' dominates the BJP
 party ne maujuuda parshadon kaa tikat kaatane kaa prayog gujarat main bhi kiya tha, jo khaasaa safal bhi rahaa tha
