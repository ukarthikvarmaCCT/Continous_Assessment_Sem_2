 It was given the power of inquiry, which is not needed
 sibiai ko praarambhik jaanch karne kii jarurat he taaki jaanch main aage badha ja sake
 He asked, 'how can you separate the preliminary inquiry from the entire investigation? Therefore, the power to conduct preliminary inquiry was further weakened in a way from the CBI to the Lokpal Bill
 ’bedi ne ummid jataai ki sansad sthaayee samiti ke prastaav ko ulat degi
 He said, "parliament can dismiss the standing committee, so we hope that the parliament will unanimously free the CBI

 The Prime Minister offered prayers here on Saturday and then meditated in the cave, after several hours of sadhana, when the PM came out of the cave, he gave many messages
 phir chaahe vah hindutv kaa sandesh ho yaa phir matdaan ke din kedarnath se vishwanath kii nagari kaashi ko sadhana
 For the last two days, even though this visit of the Prime Minister has been on the target of the opposition and social media, Narendra Modi has targeted many people with this one visit

 The Prime Minister gave the message of Hindutva
 
 
 shanivaar subah se hi pradhanmantri kii kedarnath yatra charchaa kaa vishay rahi
 During the election campaign many occasions came when the leaders were bowing in the temple-mosque
 lekin jab varanasi main matdaan hona tha, to usase pehle chunaav prachaar ko khatm kar piem kedarnath pahunche
 Here he worshiped by law and later went to meditate in the cave

 But PM did not reach Kashi, the Prime Minister is in Kedarnath for two days

 Even though it will not be included in the election campaign, but in the last two, his pictures were captured on TV and social media, in such a situation, once again the issue remains PM Narendra Modi

 The biggest impact of this trend was seen in the elections of gram panchayats and urban bodies in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan this year
 in chunaavon main badi sankhya main shikshit or peshewar yuvaaon ko dekha gaya
 And most of them were from families with no political background

 muslim pakshakaron ke vakil rajeev dhawan apana paksh rakhaa
 Justice Bhushan asked, "why did Hanuman become the gatekeeper at the gate?" Jai Vijay? "rajiv Dhawan said to this," Between the late 19th century 1873-1877 when both types of prayers were happening there
 '' phir justise bhushan ne kaha, ''ye to vishnu mandiron ke dwarpal hote the jai vijay
 The criterion pillars bearing the idol of Jai Vijay are also mentioned in 1428
 '' is par dhawan ne kaha, ''mujhe wo photo magnifing glass yani aatishi shishe se dekhni hongi
 "justice DY Chandrachud said," But these arguments and pictures with the pillars testify not to the presence or absence of a mosque, but the Hindu holy place there
 '' bahes ke dauraan dhawan ne kaha, ''14 khambe chaahe dhahaae gaye yaa mili, isse mandir hone kii pushti kaise ho sakati he ki muslim hi kahin or se laae hon!'' dhawan ne kaha ki jilani bolenge
 Jilani said that this was not our argument
 court ne imaarat main bani phool or praaniyon kii akritiyon par sawaal poocha to dhawan ne nirmohi akhaade ke likhit bayaan ke hawaale se kaha-dwaar ko lekar bhi bada vivaad tha
 On 13 December 1877, a gateway at the outer wall of the disputed building was erected in the doorway to provide separate entry exits for both
 vivaadit imaarat main akritiyon ke sawaal par dhawan ne jawaab diya ki baahar ramajnmasthan yatra kaa pathar laga he
 This trip took place in 1901
 unhone 1990 main khinchi khambon kii tasviir lagaai he
 Where did the test poles come from? Some say they came from Nepal, some from Sri Lanka
 devataaon kii akritiyaan kahin nahin hai
 Lotus and flowers are everywhere in Islamic art as well
 kasuti khambe chat ko saport karne ko nahin balki sajaavati hai
 Only the decorative artifacts are being described as Hindu
 justise bobade ne poocha, ''kya kisi masjid main aisi camel yaa aisi anya akritiyaan hai? kyonki hoicourt ne bhi isko manyata di he
 "dhawan said on this," Qutub is in the mosque near the tower
 ham kisi or jaj kii manyata par nahin ja rahe
 At that time, the king, Sultan, Nawab used to have the same law
 gaiyr kuranik kaary karne vaala raja bhi gaiyr islamic mana jaataa tha
 There was neither a figure on the western wall nor a pillar in front
 yani gaiyr islamic namaaz nahin hui
 "then Justice Chandrachud said," Over time there are also cultural confluences
 '' jis par rajeev dhawan ne kaha, ''aapaki ye baat hamaari daleel ko majboot karti he
 There was a temple below, this is a different argument, but here the debate is about breaking the temple
 sirf chihn milane se devtaa vahaan the isaki pushti kaise hoti he? ye to is par nirbhar karata he ki andar prarthana kaa tarika kaisaa he! sachai yahi he andar masjid or baahar ram chabutara tha

 " infrastracchar lij and finanntial services (IL&FS) ke difolt ke baad bazaar main ubharate sankat par kaabo paane ke liye sarkaar ne do pramukh kadam uthaae
 First, after knocking on the door of NCLT, the management of the company took over and deployed the new management and secondly ordered the Serious Fraud Investment Office i
e
 SFIO to check the accounts of the company
 IL&FS sankat se ubharne ke liye kya ye kadam paryaapt hai? yaa inkaa makasad keval baichaiyn bazaar ko fori taur par raahat dena or vipaksh ke haath sarkaar ko gherne kaa nayaa shigupha na lage isaki taiyaari bhar he?beemaari sir main ilaaj poonch kaesaio jaanch kar yah bataaegi ki company ke fund kaa galat istemaal to nahin hua lekin yah jaanane se zyada jaruri philhal aane vaale dinon main karj ke purnbhugtan ke liye fund jutanaa he
 IL&FS has a maturity of about 835 crore commercial papers as of March 2019
 vahiin inamen se 250 karod rupye kii dendaree disambar main he
 The government has assured that in the coming days, cash will be arranged to avoid default
 nishchit taur par sarkaar iskaa bidaa elisi or esbiai ke kandhon par hi rakhegi
 But the big question is how is it fair for a company that has a Bond d or default rating, checking the accounts with SFIO, to bailout it with the help of depositors or taxpayers? The business model of NBFC companies including IL&FS is all non-national in the country
 The business model of banking financial company (NBFC) is to raise money from bonds and give expensive loans
 inke paas dipogiters kii sasti puunji nahin hoti
 At a time when it is difficult to sell bonds due to lack of cash, where will the path of the company emerge
 kharaab bazaar main bond kii placement oonchi dar (yield) par hoti he
 The entire market of bonds runs on trust
 yield kaa badhanaa na keval IL&FS yaa enbiensi sector ko chot pahunchayegaa balki puure bazaar ke sameekaran bigaad degaa
 "after the IL&FS crisis, companies in the entire NBFC sector are finding it difficult to sell in their bond markets," says Sanjeev Sharma, fund manager of Kinarafinational Fund Quanch, which is doing mutual funds
 mutual funds is spes main paisa nahin laga rahe hai
 Companies in this sector are being forced to sell their bonds at high yields
 sharma aage kehete hai, ‘’mutual fund enbiensi bond ko bech bhi nahin paa rahe hai
 In such a situation, redemption has to be paid by selling the second bond
 ’’ bond bazaar se paise na milane par IL&FS ke nae management ko fund ke liye iske itar kuch nae raste khojane honge
 Foreign investors are also staying away from the bond market at present due to weakness in selling
 saal kii shuruyaat se ab tak rupaya kareeb 15 fisadi kamjor ho chukaa he
 Due to the weakening of the rupee, foreign investors lose because their returns are actually in rupees
 rupye kii maujuuda haalat ke chalate videshi niveshkon kii ore se philhal bond bazaar main bikwaali hi jari he
 Where can IL&FS get money? After sidbi's default of Rs
 1000 crores, IL&FS revealed some possible ways of income
 jinamein mukademon main fansaa company kaa 16000 karod rupaya, 3 xxrep 4 0 karod rupye ke mulya vaali company kii 25 sampattiyon kii bikri or rhite ishyu ke jariye 4500 karod rupye jutaney kii yojana
 a major reason for IL&FS getting caught in the crisis is actually short-term loans to finance long-term projects

 Sadhvi has expressed apprehension that several schemes including the Bhopal Metro, Smart City Project, Amrit Yojana, Public Health Protection, Sewage will hang in the balance due to the split of the Bhopal Municipal Corporation into two parts

 Afghanistan has been burning in the fire of war for 18 years, the war that started again in Afghanistan on August 31, is bringing back its army
 America has been seeing two completely opposite pictures of Afghanistan burning in the fire of war for the last 18 years
 ek taraf jahaan taliban ke saath america shanti ke liye nauven daur kii vaarta kar rahaa he vahiin duusari ore kundooj-helmond jaise uttari kshetron main afgaan surakshabalon or taliban ladaakon ke bich ghaatak sangharsh chhidaa hua he
 On the one hand, while the US is determined to withdraw its troops from the Taliban as soon as possible, on the other hand, the official government of Afghanistan is not even part of this dialogue yet
 aise main logon ke man main kai sawaal hai ki kya shanti vaarta safal hogi? or agar shanti samjhauta kar america sainik chale jate hai to taliban kii satta main kitni or kisi hissedari hogi
 How will the other factions of Afghanistan react to this? sarkaar ke vartmaan seoup kaa kya hoga
 Would it be easy for civil society and other social organizations to accept the Taliban into power? Afghanistan became a war zone, according to the United Nations, in the last one year, 3804 civilians lost their lives in the conflict in Afghanistan
 jinamein 900 bachche shaamil the
 While more than 7 thousand people were injured
 ladaai tham nahin rahi balki tej hi ho rahi he
 The violent clashes on the last day of August and the first 2 days of this month tell the story of Afghanistan becoming a war zone again
 - 31 agast ko afghanistan ke uttar main sthit kundooj shahar main taliban or sarkari suraksha balon ke bich bheeshan sangharsh chhid gaya
 36 Taliban combatants were killed in the collision
 teen nagarikon kii bhi maut ho gai
 Taliban fighters have made their hideout in several houses in the city and have also entered the city's main hospital
 ve vahiin se sarkari balon or aam nagarikon par hamale kar rahe hai
 - On September 1, the Taliban attacked the second city of Afghanistan, Puli Khumari
 shahar par niyantran ke liye donon pakshon kii ore se golibari jari he
 On September 2, at least 9 people were killed and 27 others were injured in an encounter between security forces and Taliban militants in Baghlan province
 talibani aatankwaadiyon ne hossain khil tathaa jamaan khil ilaake main suraksha balon par hamalaa kiya
 The army chased them away
 kin ilaakon par barchasv ke liye jari he janmaugan local media ke anusaar kundooj, takahaar, badakshan, balkh, farah or heraat main niyantran ke liye taliban or afgaan senaaon main ghamaasan sangharsh chhidaa hua he
 The kabul-baghlan and baghlan-kunduz highways are also blocked due to this battle
 puraa kaa puraa uttari afghanistan war jone main tabdeel hota hua dikh rahaa he
 How many expectations from the peace talks have been held in Qatar, 9 rounds of talks between the US and the Taliban
 donon paksh jald hi samjhaute kii ummid jataa rahe hai
 The Taliban's condition is that the US security forces leave Afghanistan
 badale main america taliban se ye guarantee chahta he ki uske sainikon ke jane ke baad afghanistan kii jameen iesas or alqaida jaise america virdohi aatanki sanghathanon kii adda nahin banegi
 The United States wants to announce the deal before the Afghan presidential election on September 28
 taliban par america ko kitna bharosa?america sainikon ko afghanistan se nikaalane ke liye bhale hi taliban se trump prashasan vaarta kar rahaa he lekin shanti kii disha main taliban par use kitna bharosa he iskaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki america nato sainikon ko puri tarah se baahar le jane kaa icchhuk bhi nahin he
 At present there are more than 30,000 troops of NATO and allied countries in Afghanistan, of which 14500 are American soldiers
 america raashtrapati trump inamen se adhikansh sainikon ko waapas bulaanaa chaahate hai lekin 8600 sainikon ko sthaayee taur par nigaraanee ke liye vahaan rakhane kii manshaa bhi rakhte hai
 Now it has to be seen what the Taliban will agree to this
 taliban ko sweekaar kar paaegaa afgaan samaaj?america or taliban ko shanti vaarta se bhale hi kaaphi ummiden hai lekin afgaan samaaj ke saamne kai sawaal munh baae khadey hai
 The seriousness of this Taliban peace talks can be gauged from the fact that on September 2, for the first time, American negotiator Jalmay Khalilzad informed the Afghan President and CEO of the terms of the agreement
 darasal ye afgaan shanti vaarta kaa pehla charan he or iske baad doosraa charan shuru hoga
 Which includes the Afghan government, civil societies and other social organizations and groups
 ab sawaal uthta he ki taliban ke kattar raaj kaa purana anubhav dekhte hue afgaan samaaj shashan main taliban kii bhagidaari ko kya sahan kar paaegaa?ek anumaan ke mutabik afghanistan par niyantran ke liye 18 saal se jari sangharsh main videshi phujon ke alaava 3,50,000 afgaan sainik or pulicekarmi morche par hai
 On the other hand, about 40 thousand fighters from the Taliban are involved in the war
 desh ke 58 fisadi hisse par afgaan surakshabalon jabaki 19 fisadi ilaake par taliban kaa kabja mana jaataa he
 The struggle for control over the remaining 22 per cent of the areas also continues
 ab shanti vaarta ke jariye agar america sainikon kii vaapasi kaa rasta banataa he to uske baad satta sangharsh nahin hoga isaki guarantee koi nahin de saktaa
 The regional ambitions of Pakistan, the Pakistan-backed Taliban and China could fuel political instability there
 aise main afghanistan main bharat kii ore se chalaai ja rahi vikaas pariyojnaon par bhi khatra utpann hoga
 Obviously, if the development work stops then the problems of Afghan society and people will increase
 in sab baton par aane vaale vakt main duniya kii nigahen hongi

 Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said she will not contest the 2020 presidential election
 unhone kaha ki vah raajnneeti se jude muddon par apni baat rakhti rahengi or un muddon ke liye logon kii aawaaj buland karti rahengi jin par vah bharosa karti hai
 According to CNN News Channel, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the 2016 presidential election, said in an interview on Monday, "I will not fight for this election
 lekin main un muddon ke liye apni baat jarur rakhti rahuungi
 "clinton, who suffered a defeat at the hands of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election in the US, said," i will continue to work and speak and stand up for what i believe in
 " unhen main bataanaa chaahati hum ki log yah jaan len ki, main apni baat kahati rahuungi
 And I'm not going anywhere
 unhone kaha, hamaare desh main kya kuch daanv par laga he, jis tarah kii chijen philhal ho rahi hai vah mujhe bahut pareshaan kar rahi hai
 Clinton, during an interview, also ruled out the possibility of campaigning for any sort
 clinton ne kaha ki unhone democratic party se raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar banane kii chaah rakhane vaale kai daavedaaron se baat kii he or unase kaha he, kisi bhi cheez ko kam aankane kii galati na karen
 We have a long list of promises and real problems broken by the Trump administration
 hillari ne kaha ki unhen neuyork main rahanaa pasand he or unhone rajya kii seenetter ke rup main jo samay bitaayaa he uske liye vah bahut abhaari hai
 Hillary Clinton created history by winning the Democratic Party's candidacy in the US presidential election
 vah america ke raashtrapati pad ke chunaav main kisi badi party kaa netritv karne vaali pehali mahila bani thi
 These comments by Hillary Clinton put an end to the speculation that she is considering contesting the 2020 presidential election
 yuva lekhak yatindra mishra in dinon lata mangeshkar par apni kitaab ko antim rup dene main lage hai
 The book also has her conversation with Lata ji about music, which is about pure music without being impressed by her glamor
 ek chota sa ansh aaj lata mangeshkar ke janmdin par
 Yatindra Mishra: When you came into the film industry, many people, many voices were active at that time
 masalan- suraiya, rajkumaari, johrabai ambalawali, amirbai karnatakai, kaanan devi, parul ghosh or shamashaad begham jaisi namchin awaazen
 At that time, keeping in mind the singing of these singers, did you decide that i do not sing like these people at all
 matlab yah ki pichley samayon main jo chalis kaa mahatvapurn dashak rahaa, usamen jis tarah yah gayikaaye apana gayan cinema ke liye karti raheen, vaisaa aapane na karne kii koi baat man main rakhi thi, ek vibhaajan rekha un gayikaon kii kala se sambaddh man main gaharaai se aakaar le rahi thi athwa yah sahaj dhang se hi lata mangeshkar dwaara gayikee kaa tarika ekaek badalane kaa maamla tha?lata mangeshkarandekhie, ek to bahut saare log abhi bhi thik se jaanate nahin hai ki us daur main gayikee kii jo styl thi, vah kis had tak ek hi dharre par kaayam thi
 When i look at this thing very carefully, i see Nur Jahan standing alone among all these people
 maine unako bahut suna tha or apane liye yah paaya ki agar filmon ke liye gaanaa he, to vah kaisaa gaanaa hona chahie
 After listening to Nur Jahan for the first time, i was able to understand how to sing if there is a sad song and how it should be sung if it is a song of happiness
 yah ek baat unke gayan se, us daur ke bare main meri samaj main aati he
 If i tell you this in my own way, then for me the song should be such that i get completely lost, erasing myself completely and forgetting it
 geet ke jo bol hai, uski jo dhun he, agar vah dukh ke liye banaai gayi he, to main yah koshish karti hoon ki uskaa prabhaav itnaa dukh bharaa nikle ki logon ko hitchkee nahin sunai de, par lage ki vaaki koi ro rahaa he
 i have been trying this more and more, so that the situation that is working in the film becomes easier
 gaate hue geet kii shakl ubharani chahie
 It cannot be that at the time of Sad Song, one feels that there is no sight of sorrow in this
 yatindra mishrabais lihaaz se aapkaa yah kahana he ki jo bhi manodashaayen jivan main vyaapt hai, uske anusaar gaaya janaa chahie or aapke dimaag main is tarah ke anusaran ke liye adarsh noorjehan ji kaa rahaa he
 Lata Mangeshkar: Ideal does not mean much at all
 maine gaanon ke bolon ke saath ye sab bhi samajhane kii koshish kii he ki ek gaanaa kaisaa hona chahie, kya hona chahie, kis tarah bayaan hona chahie
 While not liking Nurjahan ji's style, i did not follow him, but rather learned - how to sing songs, which i can develop in my own singing
 yatindra mishralyah to thik baat he, lekin jaise kalaon kii duniya main hota rahaa he ki koi bada se bada fanakaar, kalakaar kisi duusare kalakaar ke kaam ko adarsh kii tarah dekhtaa he yaa ki use bilkul kitaab kii tarah padhata he
 In such a situation, did you feel the most natural voice of Nur Jahan ji at that time? Lata Mangeshkar: His expression more than voice
 wo us jamaane main ekadam nai baat thi ki gaanaa aisa bhi gaaya jaataa he
 Sad songs or love songs are also sung
 noorjahan ji se alag sahagal sahab ek alag hi mukaam par maujuud the
 However, Sehgal Sahab was a man and it is not a minor thing to get hold of his scale or his signature temperament
 unke gane main mujhe ek hi baat milti thi or vah har tarah se parfections kaa maamla tha
 For example, he has sung 'abhon ki Ab din bisat naati' (devdas)
 vah kitna acha or kamaal kaa gaaya he
 His character in the film is very sad and is sitting drunk
 vah ga rahaa he or bahut udhaas he
 Now this expression that he gave, makes me wonder
 mujhe bachapan se aisa lagata tha ki yah gaanaa unhone kaise gaaya hoga? gaate vakt to aadmi sirf gaata he or rota nahin he
 If you cannot cry or are crying a lot while singing, you will not be able to sing in tone
 to unhone kaise rone kaa abhas dilaate hue yah geet ga diya, vah kamaal kii baat lagati he
 For all such situations that are given to us, it has always been challenging and learning for me to sing like Sahgal Sahib or to express that thing like Noorjahan
 isiliye bilkul shuruyaat se hi, jiskaa zikr aap kar rahe hai, main hameshaa dard ke, prem ke yaa khushiyon ke geet ko unheen logon ko dhyaan main rakhkar sochakar gane kii koshish karti thi
 Yatindra Mishra: But the voice of the people was such that it did not impress you very much
 yaa ise is tarah kahen ki behad naatakeey dhang kii kuch aisi awaazen, jo film ke sichuation ke saath moulik dhang ke expressant nahin de paati thim?lata mangeshkaramaine is tarah kaa andaaza nahin lagaaya he, isliye kuch kahana thik nahin hoga
 However, it is a matter of course that before us, in the field of singing, almost one kind of work was used for active voices in the world of cinema
 jaise-jaise sangeet ke kshetra main badlaav aana shuru hua, naye sangeetkaar kuch pashchim se prabhaav lekar, to kuch bhartiya lok sangeet kii dhunon ko pakadakar geet rachane main aage bade, to usee ke mutabik film kii sichuation rakhane kaa or gaanon ko record karne kaa rivaaz prachlit hua
 None of the people who were there before my arrival, did not sound like anyone who is very bad or worth rejecting
 kuch logon kaa andaaz mujhe bahut bhaataa tha, jinako sunanaa to mujhako pasand tha hi, ve alag se moulik awaazen bhi jaan padati thim
 Even if i ignore the developed singing on a track for a while, many people were singing well there
 jaise, johrabai ambalawali, amirbai karnatakai, parul ghosh, suraiya or rajkumaari ji jaisi gayikaaye
 Yatindra Mishra: The whole story of your music journey, what is worthy of being outlined separately in that culture, it emerges prominently in that you have never sung songs related to vulgar or false motives
 bahut had tak aapane maryaada kaa punarvaas kiya us film indrasti main, jahaan kuch bhi chalata tha, bas uske hone kii shart keval lokapriyata yaa bazaar se nirdhaarit hoti thi
 So what is it that inspired you to do this? Lata Mangeshkar: As far as i am concerned, i have always worked in this industry on my own terms
 mujhe shuru se hi jo sanskaar mili the, usamen ek baat pehle se hi tay ho chuki thi, ki main jo bhi karuungi, uskaa swaroop or seemayen kya hongi
 As far as film songs are concerned, it is more than any artist depending on their director, composer and lyricist what they want us to lose in terms of the film's status
 maine is madhyam ke is simit daayre ko bahut pehle hi samaj liya tha or mujhe kahin yah lagane laga tha ki jab is industry main mujhe lagaataar rahanaa or kaam karnaa he, to kuch chizein agar shuru se hi saaf kar lee jaayen, to aasaani rahegi
 There was also this obscene case, against which i stood and could sing some better vocabulary of my choice
 yatindra mishralkai baar aapako aisa nahin lagata ki jo geet aap bahut pehle ga chukin, aaj usko kuch duusare dhang se gaanaa pasand karengi
 There are many such songs which are very popular, super hit and are still very much liked today
 ek kalakaar kii haisiyat se jo aapane lagaataar gro kiya he, aapako kabhi laga ho ki mujhe yah pichhlaa gaanaa to aise gaanaa chahie tha, jabaki maine use to bilkul duusari tarah se ga diya he
 Lata Mangeshkar: No, i don't think so
 mere man main yah baat kabhi aati hi nahin
 The deficiency is definitely visible, but it does not feel like singing or listening again
 mujhe aisa lagata he ki jo us samay ho gaya, wo ho gaya
 This is also because there is no scope in film music to do anything else, whatever happens, it is good
 kabhi-kabhi bahut acha ho jaataa he, to aksar thik hi rahata he
 What has been corrected a little seems to be correct
 yah baat or he ki agar koi gaanaa bilkul thik nahin hua he, to alag baat he
 However, in my case such a situation has not happened
 or agar ai ho, yaa dusron ko aisa lagata he, to ho bhi saktaa he kyonki kai baar gane banane vaale bhi koi halkaa gaanaa bana daalate hai
 In this case, not only playback singers or singers, musicians and lyricists are also responsible
 isi tarah main yah bhi dekhati hoon ki koi gaanaa jo hamane gaaya ho, agar vah nahin chalaa, to iskaa matlab he ki usamen koi na koi kami zarur rahi hogi
 Then it has also come to see that the song was very good, but do not know why it was not heard or was forgotten
 mujhe hansi aati he yah dekhakar, ki adhikansh record companiyaan ham sabhi ke kuch gaanon ko jab ‘bhuule-bisare geeton’ ke label se prasaarit karti hai, unamem bhi adhikansh gane sabhi ko yaad hote hai yaa ki apane jamaane main superhit rahe hote hai
 Yatindra Mishra: i think in your context that the film is not done often, but the songs have gone on
 yah to maine kai baar paaya he or mere khyaal se bahuterey sangeetapremi is baat se sahamat honge ki film pit gayi, magar gane superhit hue
 For example, one film is 'shankar Hussain'
 shaayad hi is film ko bahut se logon ne dekha ho yaa iske bare main suna ho
 
 
 But both of its songs, which are in your voice and which were composed by Khayyam Saheb - 'you have gone through this phase' and 'apne raat mein chillamanen ki sarkati hai', have hardly been untouched by any music enthusiast and your fans
 aise main aap kya sochati hai?lata mangeshkarcthik baat he
 Personally, i also like both of these songs by myself
 khayyam sahab kii dhunon or zannisar akhtar or caff bhopali kii dilkash shaayari ke kaaran bhi
 What you have said is very true about the film industry
 hindi cinema main hamane yah bahut nazadik se dekha he ki achche sangeet ke bagaiyr koi film zyada dinon tak tik nahin paati
 Sometimes 'B' and 'C' grade films are easily forgotten by the audience, but the record of their music keeps on selling for years
 maine aisi bahut sari filmon main gaaya he, jinamein zyaadaatar dharmik or stant filmein shaamil hai
 His songs played a lot, but no information about the film is available
 mere khyaal se yah meraa tazurba hi nahin he, balki ise mukesh ji, rafi sahab, kishor da or aashaa bhi mahasoos karte honge
 All that is required of me is that the songs i sing should be good and be remembered for many days
 film kisi he or kisi banani chahie, yah mere adhikaar kshetra kaa maamla nahin he
 Yatindra Mishra: You have confessed many times that the song 'baron sleep nahi aaye' from 'chacha Jindabad' is the only song that you think is absolutely pure and right from the point of view of singing
 iske peeche koi khaas vazah yaa tark?lata mangeshkarsenhin, aisi koi vazah nahin he, jo main aapako de sakun
 In my sung songs, i began to hear that i had done it perfectly
 masalan kai baar mujhe apane geeton ko sunakar yah laga, ki isamen main thodi behatar taan le paati to acha hota yaa sur ko thodaa or neeche se uthaaya hota, to thik rahata
 This song seems to take me away from such problems, so that's why i said so
 aapako ek sachhee baat bataaun, jab bhi kisi film main meraa semi-clasical gaanaa aata he, to mujhe acha hi lagata he
 Meaning if someone puts it that way, makes it, then i would like it
 madan bhaiya ne to itane saare achche geet banaaye hai, ki unako ginanaa aasaan nahin
 i would also like to say that the mood of the song and the recording mood also make the songs bigger and better at times
 yatindra mishraishuddh raagadari ke sandarbh main yadi ham sangeetkaaron kii baat karen, to aap kinako shuruaati paaydaan par rakhti hai
 Especially on the first, second and third steps
 
 Lata Mangeshkar: Anil Biswas, s
 di
 Burman, Madan Mohan, Naushad Saheb, all these people
 
 
 or kisi had tak khayyam sahab ko rakhana chaahuungi, jo raagadari ko gambheertha se baratate hai
 Yatindra Mishra: i think one name, Roshan Sahab, should also be in it
 lata mangeshkarbahaan! roshanalaal ko main bhul gayi
 He was a very good musician, his grip on raagadari is also seen because he had learned from the famous beanar maestro Alauddin Khan sahib of Maihar
 ve itani badhiya dilruba bajaate the, jiskaa jawaab nahin
 However, he also had excellent knowledge of Sarangi and Harmonium
 ve akele aise sangeetkaar hai, jinhone mujhase raagon kii bandishon ko bhi jas kaa tas gavaaya
 Like Yemen's Bandish 'sakhi e Ri Ali Piya Bin' in 'raag-rang' and Gaur Malhar's Bandish 'garjat Barasat Bhijat Ailo' in 'malhar'
 isi tarah ‘chitralekha’ kaa geet ‘e ri jane na duungi’ ko sahir sahab se likhvakar gavaaya tha, jo raag kaamod kii bandish ko aadhaar banaakar likhi gayi or usee raag main compoz bhi hui
 Yatindra Mishra: Roshan Sahab has composed even more beautiful songs for you
 lata mangeshkaranji
 Very beautiful songs
 khaaskar- ‘naubahaar’, ‘mamata’, ‘tajmahal’, ‘jindagi or ham’, ‘bahu begham’, ‘chitralekha’, ‘raag-rang’, ‘taksaal’, ‘aarti’, ‘malhaar’ or ‘anokhi raat’ ke gane
 Yatindra Mishra: i think he has been a very accomplished musician, a big aspect of which also goes to Ghazal Composition
 hamaare yahan ghazal banane ke liye naushaad sahab or madan mohan ji ko hi adhik shrey diya jaataa he, jabaki yadi gambheertha se akalan kiya jaye, to roshan sahab or khayyam bhi usee shrenee main khadey nazar aayenge
 The light of his ghazals in Roshan's music films, especially - rainy night, Taj Mahal, Bahu Begum, Dil Hi Toh, Mamta and Babar etc
 is worth seeing
 aapkaa is bare main kya sochna he
 Lata Mangeshkar: You are absolutely right
 unki gazalen utani hi mahatvapurn hai, jitani ki madan bhaiya yaa naushaad sahab kii
 It should also include those qawwalis, who separately give them the status of a great musician
 barsaat kii raat, tajmahal, bahu begham or dil hi to he kii unki compoz kii hui qawwaaliyon ko bhulaanaa mushkil he
 It is a coincidence that i have sung for him in all these films, but i am not present in a single qawwali
 yatindra mishra:agar ham samay ke chakra (tim mashin) ko ghumaakar san 1949-50 main le jaayen, to aapke filmon se sambandhit sangithik jivan kii shuruyaat main khemchand prakaash, shankar-jaykishan, husnalaal-bhagatraam jaise mujeec diarector aate hai or aapako ek majboot zamin banane ke liye, ‘aayegaa aane vaala’ (mahal), ‘hawa main udata jaae mora laal dupatta malamal kaa’ (barsaat) or ‘chale janaa nahin nain mila ke’ (badi bahan) jaise gane milte hai
 This marks the beginning of a new era, which is helpful in making your height bigger
 main yah jaananaa chahta hoon ki yadi us jamaane main e
 R
 rahamaan aaye hote, jatin-lalit aaye hote, shankar-ehsaan laay hote, to ye saare gane kaise banate? us samay ‘aayegaa aane vaala’ kii aamad kisi hoti?lata mangeshkarah(hanste hue) bada mjedaar prashn he aapkaa
 Hard to say what to say on this? Can't understand how these songs would have been made if it had happened
 yah vichaar or kalpana to sunne main acchhee lagati he, par main puri tarah iskaa akalan nahin kar sakati ki ‘aayegaa aane vaala’ ko e
 R
 rahamaan ne banaaya hota yaa ‘hawa main udata jaae’ ko jatin-lalit ne, to kaisaa prabhaav paidaa hota
 But i know for sure that something great would have happened or would have come out in other ways, which would probably have different melodies and lines
 main aapse prashn karti hoon ki jo mere gane rahamaan ne banaaye, yaa jatin-lalit ke liye maine ‘mere khwaabon main jo aae’ (dilavaale dulhaniya le jaayenge) gaaya he, use shyaam sundar ji, naushaad sahab yaa anil vishwaas ne rachaa hota, to aapke lihaaz se vah kis tarah banataa?yah vaaki bahut rochak or sochane vaali baat he ki samay ke her-pher se hamaare geeton kaa swabhaav kaisaa hota? itnaa zarur main kahana chaahuungi ki puraane samayon main, jab mainen ‘mahal’, ‘badi bahan’, ‘‘barsaat’, ‘taraana’, ‘bazaar’ or ‘sangdil’ jaisi filmon ke liye parshvagayan kiya tha, us samay takneekee rup se cinema main bahut tarakkee nahin hui thi
 In 'aayega Aana Aaya', i had to come out of the room and come to the recording room with my feet and in the same proportion, the fluctuation of tone was captured on the recording mike
 bahut saare aise gane mujhe yaad hai, jisamen kuch vishesh prabhaavon ko dene ke liye anil vishwaas, shyaam sundar, sajaad hossain, salil choudhary or si
 Ramchandra tried some new ways and strange tricks, which could create that effect in the songs
 aaj, jo sthiti he or jis tarah hamaari takneekee viksit ho chuki he, usamen agar in logon ko kaam karne kaa mauka miltaa, tab to kamaal hi ho gaya hota
 Do not know how much more advanced types of these people could make music, you can think
 thik usee tarah, jaisaa sundar or stareey sangeet aaj ke sangeetkaar bana rahe hai
 If Rahman, jatin-lalit and all the other people, working backwards, how much difficulty they faced and how much they all struggled to make their song, it can also be guessed
 mere liye bhi yah kam chunauti kii baat nahin ki main anil vishwaas kii dhunon jaisaa kaam rahamaan ke saath kar rahi hoti, or usee tarah in naye logon kii dhunon par naushaad sahab ke liye record karti, to kaisaa hota?(saakshaatkaar kaa yah anshprabhat ranjanke saahitiyik blog sejankipulase liya gaya he

 kapil diarector jodi abbaas-mastaan kii film 'kis kisko pyaar karun' se rupahale parde par dikhne vaale hai
 Kapil Sharma, who ventured into the world of television from the TV show 'the Great Indian Laughter Challenge', was elevated to the high by his show 'comedy Nights with Kapil'
 is sho se pehle kapil sharma 9 reality tivi sho jeet chuke the
 Kapil won all 6 seasons of 'comedy Circus' due to his style and talent
 aikonic kamedian banane ke baad ab kapil sharma apni pehali film ‘kis kis ko pyaar karun’ se logon ko hansaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Tell us something about the journey from your small screen to the big screen till now? i have always wanted to be a stand-up comedian and singer
 main ek actor banuunga ye maine kabhi nahin sochaa tha
 With this i got a show called 'star or Rockstar'
 is sho ke jariye maine apane singer banane kaa sapana puraa kiya
 After that, i never tried my luck to become a singer, so i started doing stand-up comedy
 agar main sidhe hi actor ban gaya hota to mujhe vishwaas nahin hota
 i have been working for the last 11-12 years so now i have become camera friendly and that is why working in the film proved very helpful for me
 film 'kis kisko pyaar karun' main kis tarah kaa role kar rahe hai?is film main main ek aise vyakti kaa role nibhaa rahaa hum jo ek acha insaan he
 There is no word in his dictionary and he is always ready to help others
 isi vyavhaar kii vajah se uski shaadi teen auraton ke saath ho jaati he, yahaan tak ki uski ek garlfriend bhi hoti hai
 The films are based on the story of these situations and their handling
 film ke bare main koi khaas baat?is film kii khaasiyat yah he ki log jaisaa mujhe dekhnaa chaahate hai, vaisaa hi luk mujhe diya gaya he
 Apart from this, earlier people feared that if there is a abbas-mustan film, then the murder-mystery type will be there, but that suspicion was also cleared by the minds of our fans as soon as the promo of the film came
 is film ko bhi audiyans kaa bharpoor pyaar milegaa, kyonki yah hamaare sho kii tarah hi family ke saath dekhne vaali manoranjak film he
 How was the experience of working with the four heroines? Its beauty is that even without wanting a man, he walks with four heroines
 hakeekat to yah he ki banda chahta nahin he ki uski teen bivi or ek garlfriend ho, lekin vah jaanboojhkar kuch nahin karata, bas uske saath accidently aisa hota jaataa he
 Now that it is happening, he does not want to break anyone's heart
 apane pyaar ko sanbhaalane ke saath hi teenon biviyon ko vah kaise handle karne kaa anubhav mere liye khaas rahaa
 How was the difference between shooting the show and the film? This is my first film and i have 4 heroines in this film
 is film main maine kaam karne kaa bharpoor anand liya he
 Actually shooting 'comedy Nights with Kapil' show is very stressful, sometimes we have to shoot 16-18 hours day and night, so if i have back pain and back pain, then help Painkiller Have to continue shooting with yaha tak ki sho ke aakhri pal main bhi script main bhi badlaav karne padate hai par filmon kii shooting kii baat karen to yah puri tarah se alag he filmon main, ek shot dene ke baad aap apni venity vine main aaraam kar duusare shot ke taiyaar hone kaa intjaar kar sakate he
 Along with this, scripts, dialogs are already available which need to be read just once before the shoot starts
 ‘kamedi nits vid kapil’ sho main meri adhik jimmedaari he jiske kaaran mujh par kaaphi dabaav rahata he
 At the same time, everyone knows his role well in the film, so that the pressure does not remain on just one, they are divided equally
 film kii shooting kii vajah se meri jindagi main kaaphi sudhaar aayaa
 How difficult was it for a comedian to romance? 
 
 aisa to kuch nahin he
 a paper in Rajasthan gave the impression that i was sweating during the shoot, while there was nothing like it
 vahaan par garmi itani thi ki mujhe pasinaa aa rahaa tha
 Anyway, this is a good thing
 hamen tivi shoj main aisa karne kaa mauka nahin mil paata he, jabaki is film main romance karne kaa bharpoor mauka mila
 What was the reason for signing this film? The reality is that earlier i had to do three films, but for some reasons this could not be possible
 vaise bhi tivi par prasaarit ho rahe mere sho kii vajah se meraa kichan to sef he
 So now i want to do films that people like
 jaise ye teen biviyon or ek garlfriend vaala concept nayaa he, kuch is tarah kaa hi
 Earlier i used to work, but now i have started feeling a comedy show as a responsibility, because this show has given me a lot of love
 isi silsile main jab main abbaas-mastaan se mila to unhone kaha ki yah film mere paas kaaphi samay se padi thi, kyonki mujhe iske liye ek kamedi person chahie tha, jisaki timming sateek ho
 Then he said that i am a fan of your show and i have to do this film with you
 yah baat sunate hi maine sochaa ki itane bade diarector ko mujh par bharosa he to bhala main unhen na kaise kar saktaa hum
 That is how i signed the film
 film main apane role ke bare main kuch bataaie?is film main meraa naam shiv ram kishan he
 The mother has named me that son will do something good in Mumbai and will be of religious instinct
 usne mumbai aakar itani tarakkee kar lee he ki vah ek badi company kaa siio ban gaya he
 Just by taking advantage of this name, i am able to handle three wives and my girlfriend
 kya aapane kabhi sochaa tha ki aap is mukaam par pahunch paaenge, kiske jaisaa bananaa chaahate the aap?kisi ke jaisaa to bananaa bhi thik nahin hoga
 Actually, today people do not like to see a thing again and again in the same style and flavor
 duniya main kuch nayaa karne ke liye aapako logon se hatakar kuch alag karne kii jarurat hoti he
 i have learned a lot from the industry for this
 jab bhi main bachchan sahab ko dekhtaa hum ki ve parde par kamedi or romance ke saath hi ection bhi karte hai to lagata he ki ek insaan chaahe to bhala kya nahin kar saktaa
 
 
 Well, there was a lot to learn from abbas-mustan too
 ve jitna dikhne main bhole lagate hai, hakeekat main vaise hai nahin
 In one shot, when i was supposed to show up with the heroine, they started saying that not like this, pull a little more, then wrap it in your arms and hug it
 
 They are very hidden
 aapane film main gane gaae hai?is film main maine do gane gaae he
 One of which is based on the song club and Dr
 jisas dwaara iskaa sangeet diya gaya he
 These songs are especially for my young fans
 is gane ke liriks kaaphi fansy hai mujhe vishwaas hai ki logon ko yah gaanaa jarur pasand aayega
 My second song is based on Antara
 mujhe vishwaas he ki club geet ko darshakon dwaara saraahaa jayega
 With this, this year's Christmas and Diwali club will become a song
 thriller movie kii pahchaan bana chuke diarector abbaas-mastaan kamedi main kitna sahaj rahe?main bachapan se hi unke kaam kaa bahut bada fain rahaa hum
 This is my first film so i did not know how the film was made but the experience of working with good filmmakers like abbas-mustan was great
 vah un behtareen diarectors main se hai jinke saath har koi apni pehali film bananaa chahta he
 By the way, this is also a thriller film, which has three wives, just think what will happen to it
 baharhaal, ve behtareen diarector hai
 He knows how to do justice to his story
 isliye koi fark nahin padataa ki murder-mistry yaa thriller filmon ke alaava ve kamedi or romantic filmein nahin bana sakate
 People will praise his direction this time too
 aapke pasandida kamedian koun he jisase aapako prerana mili?mahmud sar se lekar johny liver or amaanulah khan in sabhi ke kaamon se mujhe kamedian banane kii prerana mili he haalanki maine kamedi kii tulana main adhik gambhir kaam bhi kiya he or wo hai amritsar or dilli main theatre

 Warsi said on the DVD launch of his film 'jolly LLB' on Friday, "I can't work in 'munnabhai' without Sanjay because i can't imagine anyone other than Sanjay playing Munnabhai
" film main munnabhai kaa jo kirdaar he, uski aadaten, swabhaav or vyaktitv kaaphi kuch sanjay ke vyaktitv se mail khaataa he

 It is noteworthy that Sanjay Dutt has played the lead role of Munnabhai in 'munnabhai MBBS' and 'lage Raho Munnabhai', the two earlier films of 'munnabhai' series, while Warsi has appeared as his associate circuit as his co-star

 The film is based on the famous Gujarati drama 'key Against Keys', which was later produced in Hindi as 'kishan Vs Kanhaiya'
 is naatak ke desh-videsh main saikadon sho ho chuke hai or ab yah kahani ai he bade parde par
 It has a shop of god idols of Paresh Rawal, the key brother, but he himself is an atheist
 ek din bukamp aane se unki dukaan tahas-nahas ho jaati he or unhen lakhon kaa ghaataa hota he
 The insurance company avoids calling it the 'act of God' and the key brothers come out to file a case against God
 aage kya hoga, yah to aap film dekhakar hi pataa laga paaenge, lekin main aapako bataa duun ki film kii kahani shaayad bahut se logon ke dimag khol degi
 The superstitions will show the mirror of truth and maybe you start looking for God not inside the temple, but inside the mind
 paresh rawal ek achche actor hai or unhone is film main bhi niraash nahin kiya
 Akshay Kumar is in Krishna's role, who did not have much to do, but is perfectly fit in Lord Krishna's role
 unki kad-lathi, muskuraahat unka kaam puraa kar detii he
 i felt that the story in the film was kept as the hero, so not much technical help was taken, but i would think it necessary to say here that the film has its own language and if it was used properly, then there will be many scenes and powerful Emit and leave a different impression on the audience
 tippaniyan Here, i would like to praise Mithun Chakraborty, who appeared in a different character after a long time
 film main mithun ne swami liladhar kii bhoomika bakhubi nibhaai he

 Maybe he will find something of his own meaning in this film

 andhvishwaason ko sach kaa aaina dikhaaegi or shaayad aap bhagwaan ko mandir main nahin, balki man ke andar dhundhana shuru kar den
 Paresh Rawal is a good actor and he did not disappoint in this film either
 akshay kumaar krishna ke qirdaar main hai, jinke paas karne ko bahut kuch nahin tha, par bhagwaan krishna ke qirdaar main ekadam fit hai
 His tall, sly smile completes his work
 mujhe laga ki film main kahani ko hi hero rakhaa gaya he, isliye zyada technical madad nahin lee gai, lekin yahaan yah kahana main zaruri samajhuunga ki film kii apni ek bhashaa hoti he or agar uskaa sahi istemaal hota, to bahut saare seen or damdaar hokar nikalate or darshakon par ek alag hi prabhaav chhodte
 The comments yahaan, main mithun chakravarti kii taareef karnaa chaahunga, jo bahut dinon baad ek alag hi kirdaar main najar aae

 ) According to India today-karvy's Mood of the Nation July 2018 poll (MOTN, July 2018), BJP as well as NDA seats are getting significantly lower than previous Lok Sabha elections
 siten kam hone kii sabase badi vajah vipakshi dalon kii ekajutata maani ja rahi he
 Let it be said that this survey was conducted among 12,100 people from 97 parliamentary constituencies and 197 assembly constituencies
 survey 18 july 2018 se lekar 29 july 2018 ke bich karaayaa gaya tha
 According to India today-karvy's Mood of the Nation survey, SEBJP is seen getting 245 seats out of 543 Lok Sabha seats
 jabaki 2014 ke chunaav main 282 siten mili thi
 In this way, 37 seats are seen decreasing compared to the last election
 is tarah se bijepi ko apane dam par 272 siton ke bahumat ke aankade se 27 siten kam mil rahi hai
 At the same time, according to the survey, the Congress is expected to get 83 seats
 jabaki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main 44 siten mili thi
 In this way, Congress is seen getting 39 seats
 haalanki bahumat ke jaadui aankade se kaaphi dur he
 However, the NDA alliance is getting 281 seats
 vahiin, upie ke khate main 122 siten ja sakati hai, jabaki anya sahyogi dalon ke khate main shesh 140 siten aane kii ummid he
 But if parties like SP, BSP, TMC, TDP and PDP contest with the UPA, the results can be startling
 is surat main endie ko 255 siten or upie ko 242 siten mil sakati hai
 While others can get 46 seats
 bijepi kii siten kam hone kii sabase zyada sambhaavna uttar pradesh main hai, jahaan pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi or uske sahyogi apana dal ko 80 sansadeey siton main se 73 mili thim
 In recent days, the coming together of SP-BSP has upset the political equation of BJP
 pichley dinon upi kii teen loksabhaa siton par hue upachunaav main bijepi ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The second setback for BJP is seen from Bihar
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bihar main bijepi ne nitish kumaar se alag hokar ladaa tha or nattejey kaaphi behatar aae the
 Bihari has a total of 40 Lok Sabha seats
 inamen se bijepi ko 22 or uske sahyogi dal algepi ko 6 or araspi ko 3 siten mili thi
 The rjd's graph has increased since the 2015 assembly elections
 pichley dinon bihar main upachunaav main argedy ummidavaar ko jeet mili
 RJD leader Tejashwi is continuously active in Bihar
 jediu ke bijepi ke saath dobaaraa se aa jane ke chalate mana ja rahaa he ki pichley chunaav main jitani siton par party ladi thi
 This time the election will be contested for less than that
 aise main siten kam hona swaabhaavik he
 Maharashtra is believed to be the third state in the state with bjp's dwindling seats
 rajya main congress or ensipi ek saath milakar chunaav ladane ke sanket de chuke hai
 Whereas both BJP and Shiv Sena have said to contest elections separately
 aise main maharashtra main pichley loksabhaa chunaav main aae nattejey doharaana mushkil hai
 The BJP won all the seats in Rajasthan and Gujarat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 rajasthan main bijepi apni do loksabhaa siten upachunaav main congress ke haathon haar chuki he
 In such a situation, it is very difficult to repeat the results of the last election
 isi tarah se gujarat main bhi congress kaa graph vidhansabha chunaav main badha he
 In such a situation, Congress seats can increase
 haalanki bijepi ne in rajyon main hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye odisha or pashchim bengal par focus kiya he
 This is the reason why BJP is continuously active in these two states
 lekin in donon rajyon se baaki pradesh main hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai ho paae ye kahana mushkil he
