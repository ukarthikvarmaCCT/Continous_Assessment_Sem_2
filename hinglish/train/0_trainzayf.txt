 It is noteworthy that DMK minister a Raja was sent to jail after being accused in 2G case
 sapa pramukh ne kaha, karunanidhi ne sarkaar kaa samarthan kiya
 His party was also involved in the government, but they implicated the minister of his party and sent him to jail
 ve (congress) usee ko dhokhaa dete hai, jo unka samarthan karte hai

 bhaajapa saansad balbir punj ne jor dekar kaha tha ki sarkaar apana kaarykaal puraa nahin karegi or madhyavadhi chunaav avashyambhavi he
 Balbir Punj said, whatever the Prime Minister may say, but the fact is that there is an atmosphere of instability in the country
 isiilie So many people are talking about mid-term elections
 unhone kaha, is sarkaar ne shashan karne kaa logon kaa bharosa kho diya he or loksabhaa main uski sankhya ko lekar bhi andeh he
 The country is currently going through a period of complete instability
 sapa pramukh ne bhaajapa ke saath jane kii sambhaavna se inkaar karte hue kaha ki anya sabhi uske saath haath mila sakate hai, sapa bhaajapa ke saath kabhi haath nahin milaaegi
 There is no question of this

 sabhi ko maaloom he ki koun ek behatar sarkaar chalaata he or koun nahin chalaata yaa koun dhokheybaaj he or koun nahin
 But before saying who is cheating or not or who gets development work or not, people should check their records
 dikshit main yadav ko yaad dilaate hue kaha, yadi ve uttar pradesh main acchhee sarkaar chalaa rahe hote to unke paas vahaan par dobaaraa sarkaar banane kaa record hota
 No one has repeated the government in that state even though Congress has been re-elected to power in at least two states

 "the senior BJP leader said," It is a fact that we cannot underestimate this major setback in the general election and its reasons

 "he said that we remained united in the struggle and whatever the outcome of the struggle, we will remain one
" loktantr kaa swabhaav hi yah he ki haar or jeet uskaa hissaa he
 Advani said, "one aspect of the election results is also that we often present it exaggeratedly in the face of defeat, but in the way that the defeat should not be underestimated, in the same way it should not be exaggerated

 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ek rachanaatmak vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaayegaa or ummid jataayi ki samprag sarkaar ek jimmedaar sarkaar kii bhoomika adaa karegi

 Officials of the Ministry of Urban Development, Gujarat are waiting outside with their files as the most powerful minister in Chief Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet, 71-year-old Anandiben Patel, is meeting with officials of the Revenue Department on policies related to farmers
 yah baithak mantralay kii bhavy imaarat svarnim sankul-1 main patel ke vishaal chembar main ho rahi he
 She tells an official of the revenue department, “the rules have to be followed
 ve aakhir janata ke liye hi hote hai
 Rules should be used in such a way that the public benefits from them
 isliye niyamon kaa paalan karte hue, samasyaon kaa bhi samaadhaan jaruri he
 "that officer shakes his head constantly in a gesture of consent
 anandiben patel ke prabhaav ko samajha ja saktaa he
 Apart from the Urban Development and Revenue Department, they also have the Department of Roads and Buildings
 pichley do maah main modi ke pradesh se zyaadaatar samay baahar rahane ke baavjood sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj abaadh gati se chalata rahaa he
 Chief Minister Modi has hired his trusted people for this and they are doing their responsibility well
 modi desh ke vibhinn hisson kaa daura karke jab bhi gandhinagar waapas aate hai, unhen anandiben or bijli tathaa udyog mantri saurabh patel ke saath filon kaa nibatara karte hue dekha jaataa he
 There is intense discussion about Modi's successor in the corridors of power in Gandhinagar
 kisi ko nahin pataa ki modi uski ghoshnaa kab karenge, kyonki abhi unka sara dhyaan pradhanmantri kii kursi par laga hua he
 But everyone's eyes are on Anandiben, the former Principal of Mohiniba Kanya Vidyalaya, Ahmedabad, who is known for her rigorous discipline and efficiency
 modi 1988 se anandiben ko jaanate hai, jab ve bijepi main shaamil hui thim or akaal peediton ke liye nyaay maangane ke kaarykram main hissaa liya tha
 When Shankar Singh Vaghela rebelled in 1995, Anandiben and Modi worked together for the party during that difficult period
 unki chhavi ab tak puri tarah bedaag he or unke paas anubhav kii bhi kami nahin he
 Since joining the cabinet in 1998, she has handled ministries like education and women and child welfare
 gujarati bhashaa kii behtareen vaktaa anandiben vidhansabha main damdaar netaa ke rup main dekhi jaati hai or vipaksh par hameshaa baari padati hai
 His greatest merit is that he is fearless and courageous
 1987 main ek chaatra ko doobane se bachaane ke liye ve jhil main kud gai thim, jiske liye unhen rajya kii ore se veerta puraskaar bhi diya gaya tha
 According to party sources, the only drawback is that "they are not cheerful"
 or party kaaryakartaaon ke saath dostana vyavhaar nahin rakhti hai
 "but Anandiben says," Those who follow the rules are not considered friendly, especially in the eyes of those who come for personal benefits
 mujhe mere kaamon se aankna chahie, chehre se nahin
 The speculation that is being made about Anandiben is not unfounded
 unhen kaam karne vaali netaa ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jin par modi puri tarah bharosa kar sakate hai
 She does not leave work unfinished and has the will to implement the decisions
 modi unke is gun se kaaphi prabhavit hai
 As a Minister of Primary Education Department from 1998 to 2007, he created a new system of transfers and placements for teachers and thus almost eliminated the industry of teachers transfers and placements in the state
 isse pehle bichauliye adhyapakon kaa tabadalaa karaane main rishwat ke rup main moti kamai karte the
 During his tenure in this ministry, the rate of dropout of girls in schools also declined significantly
 ab 2013 main ladakiyon ke skool chhodie kii dar mahaj do fisadi he, jabaki 2001 main yah dar 37 fisadi thi
 As Urban Development and Revenue Minister, he reduced the possibility of fraud in land deals by computerizing e-land programs, land ownership data and land records
 is kaarykram ke tahat gujarat ke 52 pratishat kisaanon ke anguuthe ke nishaanon or tasveeron kaa computarikaran kar diya gaya he
 Land deals for the remaining 48 percent of the farmers have been recorded in Tehsildar's office with a webcam
 anandiben ab shahari yojana main bhi gadbaditaan rokane ke liye satellite tasveeron kaa istemaal kar rahi hai
 State BJP general secretary Bharat Pandya says, "one of her specialties is that she works very smartly
 ve rajya kaa gahan daura karti rahati hai
 "his decision-making ability was also visible at the time when he was made the head of a committee of the Narmada project in 2008 to acquire land in the construction of the canal
 sardaar sarovar narmada nigam (esesanen) ke adhikari kehete hai ki unke turant faisla lene kii yogyata ke kaaran 2008 se jameen adhigrahan ke kaam main kaaphi teji ai
 At present, work on 37 of the 38 Narmada canals has been completed, while in 2008 this number was just 15
 isaki vajah yah he ki unhone jantri (jameen kii tay kii gai keemat kii niyam-pustika) ke mutabik kisaanon ko muaavja dilaayaa, jo saamaanya dar se kahin adhik tha
 Anandiben's administrative prowess has put her at the forefront of the Chief Ministerial contenders
 lekin unke kuch pratidwandvi bhi hai
 One of them is 56-year-old Finance Minister Nitin Patel, who has considerable influence in the Patel caste and the Sangh Parivar
 unke alaava 54 varshiya saurabh patel kaa bhi naam he, jo modi sarkaar main angrejibhashi cheharaa hai
 The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, 75-year-old Vajubhai Vala is the most senior BJP leader in the current Assembly
 ve modi ke pehle vaale do kaarykaal main vitt mantri rah chuke hai
 Apart from these, 67-year-old Purushottam Rupala, former president of Gujarat BJP is also being named
 ve achche vaktaa hai or saurashtra ke patelon main prabhaav rakhte hai
 Despite holding on to the administration, Anandiben's ability in political management is limited
 modi jahaan kai sroton se jaankaree hasil karne kii maharath rakhte hai, vahiin anandiben ke strot simit hai, haalanki ve haal ke dauron main sampark banane kii koshish kar rahi hai
 However, it is difficult to predict what is going on in Modi's mind and he has to decide who will replace him if needed

 tasviir ke saath ek bhaavnaatmak daawa kiya gaya he ki bachche kii maa kii maut hone ke baad uskaapitause paalane ke liye is tarah se sangharsh kar rahaa he
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in its investigation that the claim being made with the viral picture is completely false

 On the photo, it is written in Hindi, 'after the passing of the mother of the child, by putting a picture of the mother on her face, feeding the child, the spirit of this father is saluted Nishbad: Hoon' The picture can be seen that the man weaned the bra She is also wearing a milk bottle stuck on her face and is wearing a picture of the mother of the child on her face like a mask
 is daawey kii padtaal ke liye hamane viral tasviir ko Yandex par reverse search kiya
 We found that this photo is present in a published article on a Brazilian website
 is lekh main kaha gaya he ki Samoel Ferreira naam ke is brazilian aadmi ne maa kii anupasthiti main bachche ko doodh pilaane kaa yah asaadhaaran tarika khoj nikaala he
 When India Today contacted Samoel Ferreira on Instagram, they told us, 'my wife went to church and the child was with me
 vah maa ke bina doodh pine se manaa kar rahaa tha
 So i found this funny way to feed him
 ' unhone hamen yah bhi bataaya ki tasviir ke saath viral ho rahaa daawa puri tarah jhootha he
 My wife and family are completely fine

 We also found a video on Samoel Ferreira Cafe subukaccount, which he himself posted
 is video ko teen lakh se zyada logon ne share kiya he
 Ferreira posted the video on 29 September and wrote a caption in Portuguese, with the caption, 'when the mother needs to go out and the baby needs care: This is the way to invent
 ' Samoel Ferreira ne hamen yah bhi bataaya ki ve apane shahar ke councillman hai or ek taxi company main bhi kaam karte hai

 gujarat kii siyaasi baaji ek baar phir bijepi ke naam rahi
 Vijay Rupani's face was in the forefront of BJP in the political battleground of the state, but the election results have overtaken him
 bijepi bhale hi jeet kaa paracham fahraakar chhathvin baar satta ke singhaasana par kabiz hone ja rahi he, lekin pichley 22 saalon main wo pehali baar 100 seat kaa aankada paar karne main asafal rahi he
 That is why BJP is looking for the face of the Chief Minister as an alternative to Rupani and Rupani is not able to do anything openly
 bataa den ki gujarat kii 182 vidhansabha siton main bijepi ko 99, congress gathbandhan ko 80 or 3 anya ke khate main gai hai
 This time the election results have faded the bjp's victory
 bijepi kii jeet behad damdaar hoti to shaayad roopaani ko dobaaraa siem kaa tikat mil jaataa
 But now his track is looking tough and many faces are appearing in the CM race
 inamen nitin patel, smriti irani, purushottam roopala, mansukh bhai mandavia, aarasi phaldu or vajubhai vaala shaamil hai
 These five factors will decide who will sit on the throne of this impregnable fort of BJP
 2019 loksabhaa chunautibijepi ko apane sabase majboot garh gujarat ko bachaane main nako chane chabane pade hai
 BJP won for the sixth time but has already lost 16 seats
 bijepi ke kartadharta or pradhanmantri narendra modi is baar gujarat main kisi aise vyakti ko bithaayenge jisamen sanghathan ko majboot karne kaa madda hoga or jo 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main pichley record ko doharaana kaa madda rakhata ho
 The last time BJP won all 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state, but the Congress graph and seats have increased in the assembly elections
 bijepi usase baichaiyn he
 In such a situation, the BJP wants to hand over the keys of power in the high command to such a person, who can maintain the impregnable fort of the BJP
 majboot netritvpradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ab aagaamee chunaavon main gujarat ke liye adhik samay nahin nikaal sakenge
 In such a situation, the party wants to hand over the throne of state power, which can give strong leadership
 narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad gujarat kii satta jin haathon main saunpi gai wo majboot netritv nahin de sake hai
 In such a situation, BJP is looking for such a face in its impregnable fort, which will not only retain the party's reign, but can also advance it
 jaateey samikarngujrat chunaav jeetne main bijepi kaamyaab rahi he, lekin uske jaateey sameekaran main send lagi he
 The BJP may change its old decision to apply the caste equation
 soobe kii satta kii bagdor aise shaks ke haathon main saunpna chaahati he, jo bijepi ke paramparaagat vot bank patidaar or obisi ko ekajute banaae rakh sake
 In such a situation, for the BJP, Vajubhai is the face of OBC, while Mansukh Bhai Mandaviya as Patidar are the two major faces

 BJP has managed to win more urban seats than rural areas
 saurashtra se lekar dakshin gujarat or gramin siton par congress ne behatar kiya he
 In such a situation, the BJP would like to hand over the command of the state, which can maintain a balance between both urban and rural as well as between Saurashtra and the rest of the regions

 In such a situation, to save this fortress in front of BJP, a leadership with Hindutva brand will be required

 After Anurag Kashyap's government's decision on Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was targeted without naming him
 anuraag ne kashmir par faisle ko lekar khud ke kanphyus hone kii sthiti bhi jaahir kii thi
 Anurag wrote in the tweet, he is afraid of the way the decision is taken more than the opposition to the government's decision
 anuraag ne kashmir ko lekar back tu back teen twit kiye
 He cannot say much about Article 370 or 35A, he wrote
 iskaa implication, history, yaa facts main abhi bhi samajha nahin hum
 Sometimes i should have thought, sometimes i think why
 naa main kashmiri musalmaan hum, na kashmiri pandit
 My Kashmiri friend says the story of Kashmir is like Roshomon
 anuraag kashyap ne likhaa, kai pahalu hai kashmir ke
 All are right and all are wrong
 bas itnaa jaanata hum ki jis tareeke se yah sab hua, sahi nahin tha
 He wrote, you know what is scary, that a man thinks what is better for the benefit of 1,200,000,000 people, he knows, he has access to use his power
 anuraag kashyap kaa ye twit sidhaa-sidhaa piem narendra modi kii taraf ishaara kar rahaa tha
 After this tweet, Anurag came under target of right-wingers
 baari troling ke baad anuraag ne phir se twit kiya or likhaa ki wo artical 370 ko samaj nahin paae hai lekin jis tareeke se ise hataaya gaya uskaa tarika galat tha
 Earlier, Anurag Kashyap also had to be a victim of trolling due to being named among those who wrote letters to the Prime Minister regarding lynching

 ajtak ke paas exclusive dastavej hai jisamen aariel ne kaig kii jaanch par sawaal uthaae hai
 RIL has also written a letter to the CAG and Ministry of Petroleum on 16 January
 jisamen kuch khaas baaten saaf karne ko kaha gaya he-1
 The CAG should only conduct an inquiry as per the agreement between RIL and the Ministry of Petroleum as the representative of the Government of India
 iskaa matlab ye hua ki sieji apni report sansad main nahin rakh saktaa or naa hi ise saarvajanik kiya ja saktaa
 2
 sieji aariel ke pichley saal yani 2003-04 or 2007-08 ke dastavejon kii jaanch naa kare
 This means that RIL is demanding that the CAG should not raise any questions regarding the increase in spending
 3
 Do not link the CAG 2008-09 to 2011-12 financial inquiry with previous cases
 iskaa matlab ye hua ki gujarey saalon main jo kharch hue jaanchakarta use aage ke kharchon kii fehrist main naa shaamil kare
 4
 or ant main aariel kaa jor he ki vittiya jaanch ke dauraan kharch ke auchity par sawaal naa uthaae jaaen
 This means that if there is any extravagance of the CAG, then do not comment on it
 aariel ko iske jawaab main sieji ne likhaa he-audit ke daayre main vittiya jaanch or laagat kaa auchity dekhnaa bhi shaamil hoga kyonki audit kaa makasad dastavejon main dikhaai gai laagat kaa is najariye se vishleshan karnaa he ki kya keemten or kharch tay karte vakt paardarshita barti gai or spardhaatmak prakriya kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya

 gunjan or shrividya ne us samay shandaar dhang se pradarshan kiya
 These two pilots often flew extremely close to Pakistani poshines amidst the challenge of rescuing the injured and identifying Pakistani poshysons in the Kargil region that they were away from the Pakistani gunners' range
 ek baar to gunjan kaa helicopter kargil kii hawaii pattee par tainaat tha or tabhi un par sidhaa hamalaa hua
 a Pakistani soldier may have fired a missile meant to be fired directly on his aircraft
 pakistani sainik kaa nishaanaa chook gaya or vah (rocket yaa missile) gunjan va unke aircraft ke peeche pahari par jaakar fat gaya
 This did not distract her at all
 gunjan ne kisi bhi mishan ke liye unke saath rahane vaali ek puri tarah se bhari hui insaas rifl or ek revolver ke saath apni parichaalan udaan ko jari rakhaa
 In the event of a crash landing near the Pakistan Army position, she would fight to get out of the trouble, just as her brother in the Indian Army stationed at Kargil was fighting
 tippaniyan Today, after 17 years, Gunjan says that his biggest inspiration was to bring the wounded soldiers of the Indian Army to safety during Kargil
 unhone kaha, 'ek helicopter payalat hone ke naate mere vichaar main yah savshereshth bhaavana hoti he
 The evacuation of casualties was one of our main roles there
 main kahana chaahuungi ki jab aap kisi kii jindagi bachaate hai to yah behad santoshjanak bhaavana hoti he, aakhir isi kaam ke liye to aap vahaan par hai
 ' bhartiya vaayu sena main yuva mahilaon ko jo avasar ab mil rahe hai, vaise avasar flite leftinent gunjan saxena ko kabhi nahin mili
 His tenure as a short service commission officer came to an end after seven years, but his association with the Indian Air Force never ended
 kyonki unhone bhartiya vaayu sena ke emai-17 helicopter ke payalat se shaadi kar lee
 Gunjan says women pilots are now getting a permanent commission in the Air Force and this is a commendable move
 ve kahati hai, 'mujhe lagata he ki ladaaku daston main mahilaon ko shaamil karnaa vayusena kaa ek bahut bada or sakaaratmak kadam he
 As a pioneer, i want to say that it is great to hear this news
 mujhe ummid he ki ladaaku daste main shaamil hone vaali yah mahilaayein vastav main apana 100 pratishat dengi or sahi myanon main aasmaan kii oonchaaiyon ko chhuengin

 Flight Lieutenant Gunjan Saxena never got the opportunities that young women in the Indian Air Force are getting now
 ek short sarvice kamishan adhikari ke rup main unka kaarykaal saat saal ke baad samaapt ho gaya, lekin bhartiya vayusena ke saath uskaa judaav kabhi khatm nahin hua
 Because he married the pilot of MI-17 helicopter of the Indian Air Force
 gunjan kahati hai mahila payalton ko ab vayusena main sthaayee kamishan mil rahaa he or yah prashansaneey kadam he
 She says, "I think the inclusion of women in combat squads is a very big and positive step for the Air Force

 i hope that these women who join the combat squad will actually give their 100 percent and will truly touch the heights of the sky

 lekin jate-jate bagdadi aise vahashipan par utar aayaa he ki uski maar se ek baar phir iraq kii begunaah awam tadapane lagi he
 Would you believe that the Baghdadi terrorists are now attacking ordinary civilians with chemical weapons to protect the Iraqi army? Due to these chemical attacks people are dying of suffocation and yearning
 jiskaa khauf tha aakhir vahi ho rahaa he
 When Baghdadi, the boss of terror, felt that his hookah was going to rise from Iraq, he vowed not to live nor to live
 iraq main mahatbaahi kii ibaarat likhni shuru kar di he
 Baghdadi has sent the first installment of the devastation to the innocent people of Mosul
 pehali baar is mahatbaahi kii tasviren bhi saamne aane lagi hai
 The ISIS terrorists are now convinced that it is not possible for them to survive the attack of Iraqi forces
 duniya bagdadi or uske aatankiyon kii in goliyon se zyaada dari hui nahin he
 The world no longer feels threatened even by these bombings
 balki duniya ghabara rahi he us sabase nae khatre se jise chemical vepan kehete hai
 How dangerous is this most dangerous weapon of Baghdadi, it cannot be estimated
 mosul se ab is tarah kii khabaren aam ho rahi hai ki aatanki jo dhamaake kar rahe hai uske baad ajeebogareeb tasviren or asar dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Everything is going to waste after the explosion

 In this explosion, 7 people died of burns, while the body of a 5-year-old child was badly burned
 uskaa philhal irbil ke aspataal main ilaaj chal rahaa he
 According to the child's family, there was a strange smell after the rocket explosion
 isaki jad main aane vaale logon ko unke badan main jalan mahasoos hone lagi
 The rocket fell near his house
 sanyukt raashtra pehle hi mosul main aatankiyon ke chemical hathiyaar istemaal karne kii chetavanee jari kar chukaa he
 Not only this, the UN fears that ISIS has a stock of hazardous chemicals like mustard gas, ammonia and sulfur
 jisase wo tabaahi machaa sakate hai
 The chemical weapon is so terrified because it makes thousands of millions sleep in an instant
 koi kisi tarah agar batch bhi gaya to bimariyon kii chapet main aakar ghut ghutakar marane ke liye majaboor ho jaataa he
 Chemical weapons are also dangerous because by the time people perceive this poisonous attack, it is too late
 bagdadi ne jahaan iraq main apane rasinic hathiyaaron se begunaahon ko nishaanaa bananaa shuru kar diya he, vahiin usne apane kabje vaale shahar mosul main kai aisi zahreeli chizon kaa zakhira bhi ikattha kar rakhaa he, jo bam or barood kii surat main hawa main ghulte hi lakhon logon ko maut kii neend sula sakate hai
 Despite besieging Mosul, the Iraqi Army is currently keeping its footsteps alive

 kya inaam main koi beti jeet saktaa he? kya kisi ko inaam main koi beti de saktaa he? aap kahenge ki ye kya behuda sawaal he
 But believe me, daughters are being given in prize to those who win in a Pakistani TV reality show
 pakistani tivi ke is sho main har episod me banpar prise ke taur par paalane main ek bacchee ko rakhaa jaataa he or jeetne vaale ko wo bacchee kisi trophy kii tarah de di jaati he
 This most unique show of its kind in the world has caused worldwide outrage
 is game sho main jeetne vaale beaulad jodon ko sho ke host aamir liyakat hossain kooday ke dher par phenk di jane vaali laavaaris betiyaan bataur inaam baant rahe hai
 As soon as the show started in Pakistan, there was a panic in the whole world including Pakistan
 tivi game sho ke itihaas main aisa pehali baar ho rahaa tha ki inaam main bacchee di ja rahi thi
 So far, four different episodes of the show have come and four girls have been awarded to four winning Beaulad couples in four episodes
 pakistan ke is sabase mashhoor sho kaa naam he amaan ramadan
 Actually, this game show has two aspects - a good one bad
 ham aapako is game sho ke donon pahaluon ke bare main bataaen, usase pehle jaan len ki ye game sho asal main he kya?ramadan ke maddenjar shuru hua ye game sho sahari yani subah ke vakt se lekar aftaar yani shaam ke vakt tak kareeb 7 ghante telecast kiya ja rahaa he
 The aim of this is to entertain people by telling them the right time and right way to support and transmit, ie in this show of concept of infotainment, people are treated by telling them the importance of Quran and Ramadan
 sho main jeetne vaale ko car, auto, tivi, frij, mobile or laptop jaisi chizein bataur inaam di jaati thim par sabase bada jacopot he beaulad jodon ko inaam main bacchee dena
 Aamir is famous in Liaquat in Parkistan for presenting his shows in such a way that TRP records are broken
 pakistan main ramadan ke maheene ko is lihaaj se bahut ahm mana jaataa he
 Here in the month of Ramadan, most of the people prefer to pray in their homes and in such a situation, there is a war in TV channels for the sake of TRP and then new stunts to earn TRP
 ek danpati ko jab bacchee mili to unki khushi kaa koi thikaana na rahaa
 The woman said, 'I could not believe that we were being given this baby girl, i am very happy
 ' aadmi ne kaha, 'pehle ham complit nahin the, is bacchee ne aakar hamen complit kar diya
 The arrival of this girl has aroused our house
 'sho ke host aamir liyakat hossain ne kaha ki is sho main un logon ko shaamil kiya jaataa he jo be-aulad hai
 Many questions are asked to such people
 phir aakhir main us jode ko bulaayaa jaataa he jise bacchee saunpi jaani he
 The couple are given as baby gifts on live TV
 sho ke khilaaf uthi aawajvaki kya ye sho laavaaris bacchiyon ko maa-baap kaa saaya dilaane kii nek koshish he? be-aulad jodon kii god bharne kii ek acchhee pahal? yaa phir besahaara bacchiyon ko inam ke taur par baant kar bas tiarapy batorne ke khel? pakistani tivi sho ke is nae hatkande ne raaton-raat is sho ko mashhoor to jarur kar diya he, lekin jitani baaten is sho ke haq main ho rahi hai usase kahin zyada baaten sho ke khilaaf bhi ho rahi hai
 Such methods of adopting girls are now being questioned
 naa sirf pakistan, balki puri duniya main puche ja rahe hai
 There has been a debate on the show on newspapers and websites around the world
 'is tarah tamaasha thik nahin'isaki shuruyaat hui pakistan se
 Anwar Kazmi of the Idi Foundation, a leading NGO in Pakistan, has questioned the show, saying that it is not right to adopt children in TV shows like this
 agar ye karnaa hi he to ise chupchaap karnaa chahie, ise tamaasha nahin bananaa chahie
 In this way, the identity of the child and the adoptive parents in the live show will be further problematic
 naa sirf maa-baap balki bachche ko bhi samaaj ke taane sahan karne padenge, jo bilkul thik nahin he
 People opposing the show say that before the adoption of a child in any country, the parents are thoroughly examined
 ye jaanch anaath ashram se shuru hokar police tak pahunchati he
 The investigation finds out whether the couple will be able to handle the child's parental responsibility
 lekin sawaal he ki channel main mata-pita kis binah par chune gaye hai?ham nek kaam kar rahe hai: sho hosttamam virodh ke baad bhi amaan ramajaan sho ke ankar doctor liyakat hossain ko ye sab thik lagata he
 He says that all this has not been done to garner TRP, but rather a noble motive behind it
 unhone kaha, 'hamaara sho reating ke maamle main pehle se hi number van he
 These children are neither garbage nor useless things, so we have picked them up from the dustbin and handed it over to a needy couple
 isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 We are pushing people in Pakistan to adopt orphaned children
 'virodh ke peeche ek vajah pakistan kaa kanoonis sho ke virodh ke peeche ek vajah pakistan kaa kanoon bhi he
 The law here does not allow adoption of children in this way
 lihaaza aise main jode ko bacchiyon ke kanoonee abhibhavak banane ke liye adaalat kaa daravaaza khatkhataana pad saktaa he
 Even though the couple has taken the baby girl, both of them may have to continue a long battle
 kanoonee taur par izaajat ke baad hi ye donon is bacchee ke maa-baap maane jaaenge
 Article 15 is not taking the name of the controversy over the film
 trailor relies hone ke baad se is film kaa virodh kiya ja rahaa he
 Many Brahmin organizations alleged that his image was tarnished in the film
 iske baad diarector anubhav sinha ko phone or email par dhamkee tak di gai he

 The threats of my murder or the rape of my sisters and my late mother cannot be communicated
 ''meraa vishwaas he ki aap main se adhiktar log is prakaar ke virodh kaa saamana nahin karenge
 First of all, let me explain to you that the trailer of any film cannot tell its full story

 isliye offis jaldi aane kii aadat daalen
 If you can't come soon, try to come on time

 Know everything about the company: To work in any company, it makes sense to know about its policy and its rules

 Do not make these 5 mistakes even in job interviews

 Clean up Facebook before job interview, know why

 lekin centre sarkaar ne aapattiyon ke saath unki file punarvichaar ke liye collegium ko waapas bhej di thi

 AIADMK Supremo j
 jayalalita ke khilaaf aay ke gyaat strot se adhik sampatti rakhane ke maamle main faisla sunaate hue vishesh adaalat ne kaha ki apane purv dattak putr sudhakaran ke bhavy vivaah main hue sabhi kharch kaa bhaar purv mukhyamantri ne uthaaya tha or yah kareeb teen karod rupee tha
 Sudhakaran was married in 1995 while Jayalalithaa was the Chief Minister
 is vivaah ko lekar kaaphi vivaad hua tha, dikhaave par aalochana hui thi, pradarshan hue or adaalat main yachikaayen daayar kii gayi
 Special Judge John Michael d'cunha said, "it has been confirmed by the evidence that printing of invitations, publishing thank-you messages in newspapers, giving 'tambul (paan) and precious gifts to guests, in fact, more than three crores rupees
" Amount spent ' Rejecting the claim that the entire cost of the marriage was incurred on behalf of the bride, the judge said, "considering all the above facts and circumstances, it has been confirmed that A-3 by accused A-1 (jayalalithaa) An amount of three crores was spent on the marriage of (sudhakaran)
 ' The judge said that the evidence shows that all the arrangements were made on Jayalalithaa's behest and she paid them as well
 abhiyojan paksh kaa kahana tha ki vivaah par chah karod rupee kii raashi kharch hui thi
 The judge also said that VIP guests were invited to the wedding and their stay was arranged in hotels
 in sabhi intjaam ke liye bhugtan jayalalita ne kiya tha
 It is administratively possible to hold state assemblies and Lok Sabha elections together, provided adequate arrangements and mechanisms are in place
 rajnatik partiyon ne is par abhi koi spasht raay nahin rakhi he
 However, a Parliamentary Committee, Law Institutions and NITI Aayog have considered the proposal and after considering its disadvantage, their recommendations have also come
 isamen do raay nahin he kisaath-saath chunaavkarane ke kuch phaayde to yakeenan hai
 For one, in a huge country like India, it takes a lot of time and resources to separate state legislatures and Lok Sabha elections and it takes a lot of time, money and labor to conduct elections continuously in the states
 duusare, chunaav ek hi baar main hon to rajnatik partiyon ke vyavhaar par najar rakhana aasaan hota he
 Thirdly, during the election process an atmosphere of low level personal attacks and electoral violence starts on each other, it will be limited to a short time
 bhartiya loktantr main rajnatik partiyaan sabase kamjor kadi sabit hui hai
 The more elections are held, the more directly or indirectly these parties are engaged in an aggressive stand
 sabase badhkar to isi ek phaayde ke liye ek saath chunaav karaane kaa mudda jaij thahartaa he
 That is, the shorter the elections, the less chances for political parties to be aggressive on each other
 isse desh main maahaul kuch kam garam hoga or saamaanya haalat banaae rakhane main madad milegi
 In the end, the expenses of political parties and Election Commission will decrease after a time, which is actually the taxpayers' money
 haalanki shuruyaat main atirikt voting mashin or kaarybal kii jarurat kaaphi bad sakati he
 But of course in the long term, spending may eventually come down
 lihaaja, rajnatik partiyon, kharch or jaruri kaarybal ke maamle main lambey samay se ek saath chunaav karaane ke phaayde uske nuksaan par baari padenge
 After all, political parties have to spend a lot to go to the elections again and again
 chunaav kam hone se us kharch main to kami aegi hi
 Apart from this, expenses will also be reduced under the head of Election Commission
 ham kaaphi paisa bhi bachaa paaenge kyonki matadaata suchiyaan taiyaar karne par kam kharch hoga or use baar-baar badalanaa nahin pad saktaa he
 The second argument in favor of simultaneous elections is that it will be easier to follow the code of conduct if the elections are held simultaneously
 iskaa yah arth katai nahin he ki jaldi hi ek saath chunaav karaane kii disha main bad ja sakate hai
 The biggest hurdle in this is that according to our constitution the House can be dissolved only by the ruling party's decision or no confidence motion
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki jab tak sadan ke kaarykaal kii avadhi tay nahin hogi, tab tak centre or rajya main ek saath chunaav karaane kii yojana par amal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 For this, the constitution will have to be amended to fix the term of all the houses
 samasya khaskar goa, puduccheri or purvottar ke rajyon kii choti vidhansabhaon ke maamle main zyada pechida he, jahaan vidhansabhaayen bhang karne kii ghatnaayen un rajyon kii tulana main zyada hota he jahaan 200 yaa usase adhik sadasyon kii vidhansabha he
 Secondly, one of the grounds for criticism of the proposal to hold simultaneous elections is that it will hurt the federal character of our constitution because the voters will not give due consideration to local or state issues as national issues will dominate, it is not right
 yah daleel dena bhi aasaan he ki choti partiyaan apni chunavi maujuudagi thik se darj nahin kar paaengi
 This is also not true as we have experience of having assembly and Lok Sabha elections together, especially in a state like Odisha
 tisare, yah daleel dena bhi aasaan he ki saath chunaav karaane se shaayad kharch zyada hi ho
 My experience shows that political parties and Election Commission will cost more
 haalanki samooche desh main ek saath chunaav karaane se hi hamen behatar loktantr hasil nahin ho jayega, agar hamane aapraadhik prishthbhumi ke ukvamidavaaron se chhutkaaraa paane or rajnatik partiyon par niyantran ke liye duusare kanoon laane sambandhi chunaav sudhaar nahin karte
 In one case, walking on the path of reform and leaving others will be called a half-hearted way to improve our unstable democracy
 lekhak rajasav seva ke adhikari or mukhya chunaav ayukta rah chuke hai In the first semi-final match of IPL 2, Deccan Chargers defeated Delhi Daredevils by 6 wickets and secured a place in the final

 Here the third wicket of Daredevils fell as Virender Sehwag

 com / oonj8jrhgd — Saurabh Singh (@saurabhsingh) July 24, 2017 “it is not a laborer who is distributing material to the flood victims with sack on the back, but the young BJP MLA from Assam learn some UP mlas
 ”dilachasp baat ye he ki tasviir main bijepi vidhayak hone kaa daawa karte hue use share to kiya ja rahaa he lekin ye kahin nahin bataaya gaya ki yuva vidhayak kaa naam kya he
 In such a situation, there can be a question about the authenticity of the picture
 india today kii fact check team ne tasviir kii sachai ke saath kathith vidhayak kii pahchaan jaanane ke liye padtaal kii
 In this effort, we got a similar picture which was shared last year and it was shared during the flood in Assam
 us tasviir main bhi vidhayak kaa naam nahin tha
 Local reports on floods last year indicated that the MLA shown in the picture may be Roopjyoti Kurmi, MLA from Mariani seat
 ab hairaan karne vaali baat he ki rupajyoti kurmi bijepi ke nahin congress ke vidhayak hai
 When MLA Roopjyoti Kurmi was contacted, she confirmed that she is the same in the picture and that the photo was taken last year
 kurmi ne india today se kaha- 'haa, ye tasviir tab lee gai thi jab main kanziranga neshnal park ke paas sthit bokakhaat vidhansabha kshetra ke ek chaay bagan main sthit loar primary skool main banaae gaye raahat camp main gaya tha
 i had a fleet of 40 mini trucks loaded with food and relief material, as my friends were helping in this campaign, it would have been unfair to ask them to just carry the rice bags, so i also sacked some carry-on bags
 Each of which weighed 25 kg
 ’vidhayak rupajyoti kurmi ne kaha ki wo is se avgat he ki unki tasviir ko bijepi vidhayak kii ore se baadh raahat main acha kaam bataate hue share kiya ja rahaa he
 Kurmi said, 'see this is BJP government and their leaders are engaged in all kinds of propaganda
 isamen koi aashcharya nahin ki unke kaaryakarta aisa kaam kar rahe hon
 According to Kurmi, he published the information in local newspapers to stop this propaganda, but even then, these acts continue
 rupajyoti kurmi kaa naam haal main surkhiyon main aayaa tha jab wo mariyaani main khud khet jotate dikhe the
 He also helped build embankments along the river
 viral test se sabit hua ki soshal media par share kii ja rahi tasviir to asli he lekin usamen dikh rahe shaks ko bijepi vidhayak bataa kar galat prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he

 rashtrapitamahatma gandhiki jayanti parasarkaarauragandhivadisansthaaon kii ore se kai kaarykram yojit kiye jate hai
 People remember Bapu in different ways from cleanliness to non-violence lessons
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai apane janmdin ke din gandhi kya karte the or kaise apana janmdin manaate the
 
 
 According to Gandhian Ramchandra Rahi, perhaps Gandhiji did not celebrate birthdays, but people celebrated his birthday
 unhone 100 saal pehle gandhi ke kahe kathanon kaa zikr karte hue kaha, aaj se 100 saal pehle, jab saal 1918 main gandhiji ne apana janmdin manaane waalon se kaha tha 'meri mrityu ke baad meri kasuti hogi ki main janmdin manaane laayak hum ki nahin
 'poona Pact was signed in jail for angry Gandhi, what is this story? What did Bapu do on his birthday on 2 October? Ramchandra Rahi, president of Gandhi Smarak Nidhi, the mother organization of Gandhian organizations spread across the country, said it would have been a solemn day
 Was, on this day he used to pray to God, drive spinning wheel and remain silent most of the time
 kisi bhi mahatvapurn din ko vah isi tarah manaate the
 But the government is organizing various kinds of celebrations on Gandhi Jayanti, there is uproar all around, programs are going on throughout the year
 is par raahi ne ieenes ko bataaya, 'sarkaar to koi bhi aayojan apane matlab se karti he
 It has nothing to do with Gandhi's thoughts
 sarkaar apni raajnneetik mahatvakanksha puri karne ke liye gandhi ke naam kaa istemaal karti he
 Gandhi was sitting on a fast when India was celebrating independence! He says that if the government really wants to celebrate Gandhi's birthday, it should try to take the society forward on Gandhi's ideas
 lekin iskaa lakshan nahin dikhataa, vartmaan sarkaar gandhi ko or gandhi ke janmdin ko safai ke saath jodatii he
 Sanitation campaigns are being organized by the government to commemorate Gandhi Jayanti
 is par raahi ne kaha, agar safai ke bare main sochen to pehla kaam yah hona chahie ki desh main safai karne waalon ko aisi suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karai jaani chahie, jisase unhen gater main utar kar safai na kerani pade
 It is a shame for the government to push the scavengers to death

 The official said that the government has exempted all government schools and recognized private schools in Kashmir for the current academic session from students of all classes, including class VIII, IX and XII, from the session-2 examination
 unhone kaha, ‘‘parinamswaroop, skulon ke liye nayaa shaikshik calendar kashmir ghati main tatkaal lagu hoga
 The official said that in the earlier government order, the order to end the policy of not failing from class fifth to ninth will be applicable from the academic session 2017
