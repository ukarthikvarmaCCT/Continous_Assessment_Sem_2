 tivi kaa mashhoor kamedi sho 'kamedi nits vid kapil' band hone ja rahaa tha or iske band hone kii ghoshnaa bhi kar di gai thi
 Kapil Sharma, the show's host and comedian, was the last to laugh out of viewers on Colors Channel on 17 January

 channel se naaraaz hai kapilshanivaar kii raat ko ek or kamedi sho 'kamedi nits bachaao' shuru kar diya gaya
 Angered by this, Kapil spoke of shutting down the show, but due to no replacement of the show, it was talked about airing till January
 chunki ab krishna ne is sha ko host karne kii hami bhar di he isliye yah sho ab band nahin hoga
 Krishna is still making the audience laugh in 'comedy Nights Bachao'
 isi baat se naaraaz kapil sharma ne channel se alag hone kaa nirnay liya he
 There are differences between Kapil and Krishna, now 'comedy Nights Bachao' has also become very famous and is entertaining the audience very much
 kamedi sarkas main vijeta rahe kapil sharma or isi sho main pratibhaagi rahe krishna abhishek ke bich matbhed kisi se chupe nahin hai or aise main ab dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kyakapil sharmaakoi nayaa sho lekar kisi duusare channel par aate hai

 The Indian attempt to reach Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was sentenced to death in Pakistan, has been thwarted for the 14th consecutive time as the Pakistan Army has refused to give counselor access to Kulbhushan Jadhav
 paak sena ke prakta major general asif gafoor ne is par kaha he ki jadhav ke masale par koi samjhauta nahin ho saktaa
 Kulbhushan was involved in anti-pak activities, so we cannot give diplomatic access to Jadhav

 The Pakistan government has not given information to India on this, but it is clear from the response of the Pak Army that the government's stand will not be different from this
 paak sena ne bharat ke is daawey ko khaarij kiya ki jadhav kii kanoonee zaruuraton ko puraa nahin kiya gaya
 India has made it clear in strict terms that if the execution is punishable, it will be a pre-planned killing by Pakistan

 Counselor access to Kulbhushan Jadhav is being denied
 kya kahin pakistan ghabara to nahin rahaa he
 Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said the truth behind Jadhav not being allowed to access counselor and appeal is that the Pakistan Army and the government are trying to murder together
 is par congress ke netaa sandip dikshit ne kaha ki aapane use faansee kii sajaa di he
 People also visit their relatives in this
 aisi gundgardee nahin chalani chahie

 Meanwhile, there has been a ruckus about a tweet by folk singer Malini Awasthi on the matter
 rape kii ghatnaon ko dharm ke chashme se dekhne ke aaropon par malini avasthi ne safai di he
 At the same time, it has hit back at opponents
 ajtak se phone par baatcheet main malini avasthi ne kaha, 'main khud bhi ek aurat hum or main ek beti kii maa hum
 Whatever i have sung throughout my life, i have sung songs dedicated to women
 nirbhaya kaa kissa ho yaa kathua kaa cond ho yaa phir koi rape kii ghatana, uske doshiyon ko faansee kii sajaa milani hi chahie
 He said that it is only through the incident of molestation that a girl's heart crosses
 mandsaur kii ghatana ke bare main bhi sunate hi man aakrosh se bhar gaya, lekin mujhe yah laga ki main ek akeli kalakaar hum, jisane is maamle main twit kiya
 i just said that it is strangely surprising that for some people, one thing becomes so big that it becomes widespread at the international level and no one even speaks on the other incident
 'malini avasthi kaa maananaa he ki jo log kathua cond par hallaa machaa rahe the, wo is ghatana par chuppi saadhe hue hai
 Such people are also watching the incident of rape through the glasses of religion
 bollywood ke kalakaaron par sidhaa hamalaa bolte malini avasthi ne kaha, 'main poochna chaahati hum ki bollywood main bahut kalakaar hai, unako kathua cond ko lekar shame ai thi, lekin mandsaur kii ghatana par shame kyon nahin ai?'jab unase sawaal kiya gaya ki kya aap rape ko dharm ke chashme se dekh rahi hai, to unhone kaha, 'mammandsaur kii ghatnako dharm ke chashme se nahin dekh rahi hum
 i have not even taken the name of religion and i am surprised that atrocities with daughters are being linked to religion
 'lok gayika ne kaha ki betiyon ke saath atyaachaar par koi dharmik bhedbhaav nahin hona chahie
 It is good for those who understand this soon, who are ashamed of the Kathua case and locks on Juban at Mandsaur
 unhone kaha ki kathua or mandsaur donon ke aropiyon ko faansee par latakaaya janaa chahie
 The tussle over Malini Awasthi's tweet here is my tweet and i stand by it! This is about selective outrage in Bollywood and media which is very visible! As an artist i steer clear of falling trap into any political controversies that journalists like @ abhisar_sharmacreate ! Tweet is very much here! @abpnewshindipic

 com / 4xsarzjtdv — Malini Awasthi (@maliniawasthi) June 30, 2018 Folk singer Malini Awasthi's ruckus is being said in which she said, 'shame on Kathua and locks on Mandsaur! Discrimination in anger There is no hanger in Bollywood, nor is anyone writing articles in foreign newspapers and media defaming India
 na ghanton vilaap karne vaale ankar ab vyathit dikh rahe! bacchiyon main bhi bhedbhaav kaa doharaa maapdand sirf secular kar sakate hai
 Political boil since the Mandsaur incident has come to a boil after the rape of an innocent girl in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh
 ek maasoom bacchee ke saath rape ke dauraan waisi hi darindagi kii gai, jaisi kuch saal pehle nirbhaya ke saath kii gai thi or puure desh main hangaamaa much gaya tha
 The baby is swinging between life and death in the hospital
 maamle ko kuch din biit chuke hai, irfan asif naam ke aaropee ko giraftaar bhi kar liya gaya he
 The Madhya Pradesh government is also promising a fast-track hearing in the case, but questions are arising as to why the Bollywood stars did not raise voice for the girl child in this case like the Asifa rape case in Kathua? Why did the political parties not take up the streets on this matter? Why did the campaigns not run to get justice for this girl in TV and newspapers? Angry Mandausar people took to the streets in large numbers demanding justice for the girl and hanging the accused
 mandsaur kii aawaaj dilli tak bhi pahunchi or sabko sochane par majaboor kar diya ki kya vaaki hamaare desh main rape jaise ghinaune aparaadh ko bhi dharm ke chashme se dekha jaataa he?kuch logon ne rape ko bhi raajnneetik rang dekar apni dukandaaree chalaane kaa zariyaa bana liya? kya hamaari raajnneetik partiyon kii soch itani ghinauni ho gai he ki bacchiyon ke saath balaatkaar kii ghatnaon main bhi vot bank ko saadhane kaa zariyaa dhund liya jaataa he or agar aisa nahin he, to rape jaise maamalon par sabake sur ek jaise kyon nahin hote? kyon rape jaise maamalon main bhi besharmi se ek-duusare par aarope lagaakar netaa or filmustar apane-apane nafe-nuksaan ke hisaab se chuppi saadh lete hai? England captain Joe Root said his team had a special plan for Indian captain Virat Kohli, whose last tour of England in 2014 was a disappointment

 Both Rashid and Moin bring diversity to the team, but seeing the number of right-handed batsmen in the Indian team, we felt that Rashid is a very aggressive option

 pichley dinon jediu or argedy main chhid gaya tha poster wargediu ne naaraa badla he par abhi argedy kii pratikriya nahin ai habihar main ek saal baad vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai or rajya main raajnneetik sargharmiyaan dhire-dhire tej ho rahi hai
 Political parties are doing something daily so that they can remain in the headlines
 pichley dinon janata dal (you) ne ek poster jari kiya tha, jiske jawaab main rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ne bhi poster jari kiya tha
 In this way, a poster war broke out between these two political parties of Bihar
 baharhaal, jediu ne apana naaraa badal diya he
 a new slogan is appearing in the party's state office in Patna, which is slightly different from the previous slogan
 haalanki ye naaraa abhi tak pradesh karyaalay ke saamne nahin laga he
 But this poster is visible on one side of the party office
 pichley hafte jediu ne 2020 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke liye apana nayaa naaraa lagaaya he
 However, that slogan is still in front of the office, in which it was written, 'why do you think, it is okay, Nitish Kumar'
 lekin ab uske peeche ek or nayaa naaraa likh diya gaya he jo usee se miltaa julata he lekin arth main antar he
 The new slogan is, 'why should you consider Nitish Kumar
 'bihar main raajnneeti kii qawwali to chalati hi rahati he
 It may be that the answer from RJD is also given
 isse pehle jab jediu ne nayaa naaraa diya tha ki kyun karen vichaar thike to he nitish kumaar
 This slogan was followed by a poster war in Bihar
 argedy ne uske jawaab main likhaa ki kyun na karen vichaar, bihar he biimaar yani nitish kumaar ke raaj main bihar biimaar ho gaya he to vichaar to karenge hi
 At the same time, senior leader of jdu's ally, BJP, Dr
 seepi thakur ne bhi is naare se asahmati jataate hue kaha tha ki jediu kaa yah naaraa thik nahin laga
 He says Nitish Kumar is doing a better job as the Chief Minister, but rightly so, Nitish Kumar has no point in forging
 seepi thakur kaa kahana he ki is tarah kaa naaraa dena-haar ko harinaam ho gaya
 There is no point in giving such a slogan when they are doing good work
 philhal, lagata he ki jediu kaa yah naaraa party ke supremeo ko bhi bahut pasand nahin aayaa, isliye ek nayaa naaraa gadha gaya he ki kyun karen vichaar jab he hi nitish kumaar, is naare se jediu saaf kar dena chaahati he ki ab koi vikalp nahin he
 Explain that when the JDU was part of the grand alliance in the 2015 assembly elections, then the slogan was Bihar is out, Nitish Kumar
 yah naaraa raajnneeti ranneetikaar prashanth kumaar kii company ne diya tha, jo kaaphi lokapriy bhi hua tha
 Even now Prashant Kishore is part of JDU, but the slogan is being given by someone else

 Meanwhile, the government has expanded the scope of investigation in Maggi noodles for violation of food product safety standards, saying that all states have been taken samples of these noodles for testing

 Nawab Malik told reporters, "this is an injustice not only to Maharashtra but also to other states
" tamilnadu, pashchim bengal, odisha, telugana, andhra pradesh or kerala kii janata is tarah kii ninsaphi ko bardaasht nahin karegi

 Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Arvind Subramanian has criticized global rating agencies for not upgrading India's ratings despite a clear improvement in fundamental factors of the Indian economy
 unhone kaha ki reating agenciyaan bharat or china ke maamle main alag maandand apana rahi hai
 Global agencies have placed India in the lowest investment grade, leading to higher debt costs in global markets, as it relates to the investor perception
 unhone kaha, ‘duusare shabdon main kaha jaae to reating agenciyon kaa china or bharat ko lekar najariya uchit nahin he or yah asangat he
 Given this record of agencies - what we call poor standards - my question is, why do we take the analysis of these rating agencies seriously
 ’ Citing the example of the subprime crisis, he said that his role in granting certificates of AAA rating to mortgage-backed securities had also been questioned, with the US financial crisis of 2008 also including such corrupt assets
 unhone kaha ki iske alaava vittiya sankat ko lekar pehle se chetavanee nahin dene kii vifaltaa ko lekar bhi unpar sawaal uthe the
 Subramanian said in the VKRV Memorial Lecture that when viewed on the domestic front, there is a clear correlation between the analysis of the experts and the official decisions
 mukhya aarthik salaahkaar subramanian ne kaha ki nitigat faislon se pehle visheshgyon ke akalan mahatvapurn hote hai
 But once a decision is made, it remains to be seen how the dialect changes for analysis
 vishleshak aadhikarik faisle ko tarksangat tehraane ke liye peeche hatane lagate hai
 Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das had also expressed his displeasure with global rating agencies last week, saying his ratings were far from ground reality
 unhone reating agenciyon ko aatm nirikshan karne kii hidaayat de daali
 He said that in view of the reforms that have been introduced, there is definitely a case for rating improvement
 bharat pehle bhi reating agenciyon ke taur tareekon par sawaal uthaata rahaa he
 India says that India's position is more favorable than other emerging countries in terms of payment risk norms
 tippaniyan In particular, questions have arisen over the S&P global ratings that have kept China's rating AA - despite rising debt and declining growth rates
 vahiin bharat kii reating ko kabad yaa junk se sirf ek paaydaan upar rakhaa gaya he
 Moody's and Fitch have also given similar ratings
 iske liye in agenciyon ne asia main sabase adhik rajkoshiya ghate kaa ullekh kiya he jisase bharat kii sovrain reating prabhavit hui he

 Under this fellowship, students of mphil get Rs 5000 per month and phd students Rs 8000 per month

 Students protested outside the UGC office on 21 October to protest against the UGC decision

 No one came to meet the students gathered outside the UGC office throughout the day

 Currently, Sonu Nigam has gone out of Mumbai in connection with a program and he has not yet recorded his detailed statement nor written an FIR
 aapako bataa den ki sonu nigam duusare filmi sitaron ke saath saal 2014 main world tour par jane vaale hai
 During this time he will perform 12 stage shows in different countries
 is event ke liye unhone ek event management company ke saath qaraar kiya hua he
 But Shakeel wants corporations to enter into agreements with another company
 ek police adhikari ke mutabik, 'sonu nigam pehle hi qaraar kar chuke hai or kanuunan ve ab ise nahin tod sakate, lekin shakeel nayaa qaraar karne ke liye un par dabaav daal rahaa he
 ' dilli kejantar mantarpar 'purush ayog' banaae jane kii maang ko lekar badi sankhya main log ikattha hue
 These people have demanded before the government that a 'men's Commission' should be formed soon to protect them from the law of dowry harassment

 He has said that the mother-sister-sister-in-law of the man is not a woman? We have come to raise the voice for those women
 purush ayog kii maang kaa samarthan karnebijepisansad harinarayan rajbhar bhi jantar mantar pahunche or inaki maangon kaa samarthan kiya
 BJP MP said that we will support every legitimate demand for them
 unhone kaha ki sansad main pehle bhi is mudde ko uthaaya he or aage bhi is mudde ko uthaaenge
 These people gathered from all places like Punjab, Telangana, Indore, Gwalior, Jamshedpur and demanded that if there are laws in this country for trees, birds, mountains, rivers then why not for men? Troubled by the misuse of the dowry harassment law, what these people said while narrating stories about their pain cannot be ignored
 jaahir he jis tarah se jantar mantar par in logon ne apni baaten rakhi hai, us par kaha ja saktaa he ki kisi bekasoor ko naahak sajaa na mili iske liye inke najariye se bhi sochna hoga
 So that everyone can have equal opportunities to live and get justice under the right to equality in democracy

 The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President n Srinivasan said after an emergency meeting of the Board's Working Committee in Chennai on Sunday that no one demanded his resignation during the meeting and that he had a lot to do to keep him away from the job of president
 Only fair and extraordinary decision is taken

 bihar kii intermediat pariksha ko kathith rup se top karne vaale chaatr-chaatra kii hakeekat se kuch maheene pehle desh rou-ba-rou hua to hairaan rah gaya tha
 The so-called Toppercharatra's calling political science as 'prodigal science' remained in the headlines for several days 
 iske baad bihar main nakal ke thekedaaron ke khilaaf bada abhiyaan bhi chhedaa gaya
 Despite this, what changed in the situation came out from the graduation examination
 in dinon chhapra ke jaiprakash vishvavidhyalay main parikshaayen chal rahi hai
 The view shown during the graduation second section examination at an examination center was astonishing
 yahaan kya chaatr or kya chatraayen, dhadlle se kitabon or parchiyon se nakal karte dekhe gaye
 Some were so engrossed in copying that even their imprisonment on camera did not show any effect on them
 beete saal kii yaad taazaaitna hi nahin kuch vivaahit chatraayen bhi nakal karne main peeche nahin dikhin
 This view, which defied the education system, reminded me of the photographs which were shown during the high school examination last year

 However, at the examination center, when he wanted to talk to the teachers or superintendents who took the exam, he refused to speak on camera

 China's Foreign Ministry on Monday rejected the statements of Defense Minister Arun Jaitley which said that the India of 2017 is different from the India of 1962
 chini videsh mantralay ne kaha ki aaj kaa china bhi 1962 ke china se alag he or desh apni kshetreey samprabhutaa kii raksha ke liye 'sabhi aavashyak kadam' uthayega
 Dragon's wrath, while interacting with Aaj Tak, responded to China when China advised India to learn a 'historical lesson', referring to the war between the two countries 55 years ago
 raksha mantri jetali ne kaha tha ki agar vah hamen yaad dilaane kii koshish kar rahe hai, to 1962 kii sthiti alag thi or 2017 kaa bharat alag he
 He also said that the present deadlock in the Kissikkim sector has been created by China
 bharat ko china kii dhamkijetali kii bayanon ke jawaab main chini videsh mantralay kepravaktaa jeng shuaangane kaha ki vah thik kah rahe hai ki 2017 kaa bharat 1962 ke bharat se alag he, lekin usee tarah china bhi alag he
 The Ministry of External Affairs stated that the boundary between the two countries in the Sikkim sector is well-defined under the sino-british Treaty of 1890
 shuang ne kaha, 'main chaahunga ki bhartiya paksh 1890 kii sandhi kaa tatkaal paalan kare or sainikon ko waapas bulaae jo chini kshetra main ghus aae hai
 He also said that China would take all necessary steps to protect its territorial sovereignty
 shuang ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki doklam kshetra main bharat apane 'avaidh pravesh' ko chhipaane ke liye bhutan kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 Bhutan had protested: "trying to create illusions by confusing India between right and wrong in order to hide the illegal entry of Indian soldiers, in order to break the facts and even at the cost of Bhutan's independence and sovereignty"
 Which is meaningless
 unhone kaha ki china ko bharat or bhutan ke bich saamaanya dwipaksheeya sambandhon par koi aapatti nahin he, lekin vah bhutan ke bahaane bhartiya paksh ke chini kshetra main ghuspaith karne ke puri tarah khilaaf he
 The Foreign Ministry of China stated that the Bhutanese side did not previously know that Indian troops had entered Doklam territory, which was not in line with the claim made by the Indian side
 yah puche jane par ki kya sikkim gatirodh ke samaadhaan ke liye bharat or china ke bich koi vaarta ho rahi he, shuang ne kaha ki seemaa par avaidh pravesh hone ke baad, china ne dilli or beijing main kai staron par bharat ke samaksh kadaa virodh darj karaayaa he
 He said that the diplomatic dialogue between the two countries is open and smooth

 All Roman possessions are being dragged and going there
 ’’—plini da elder (77 isvi) yah likhane se pehle mujris (cochin ke nikat) main bhartiya samruddhi kaa jalawaa dekhakar lautaa tha
 In the following decades, so much of Rome's wealth came to India that Shaka Emperor Kanishka used the coins to shield his currency
 antat: roman samraat septimus (193-211 i
 ) Reduced the amount of gold in their coins
 yah itihaas main mudra ke aadhaar mulya main kami (dibasement) kaa pehla udhaaharan tha
 The same complaint was made to Pliny in the 16th century to the Portuguese and to the British in the 17th century that India draws worldwide prosperity
 alabatta plini ke 2000 saal baad, bharat main sampatti kii awajahi kaa taaja itihaas likhane vaala yah bataane ko majaboor hoga ki 21veen sadi main bharat kii samruddhi khinch kar america, europe or australia jane lagi
 It was not black money that went abroad by illegal means
 yah to udhyamiyon kii jaij sampatti yaa munafa tha jo unhone bharat main kaarobaar se kamaaya tha lekin ve iskaa sangrah duniya ke duusare deshon main kar rahe the
 In this budget, the super rich means 42 people with income above Rs 2 crore to 5 crore
 7 fisad tex ke baad hamaare vampanthi kalejon par bhale hi thandak pad gai ho, ham yah kah sakate hon ki china, japan, canada, france, euke kii tarah ham bhi apane amiron par bharpoor tex laga rahe hai
 Actually, we have hit the 'budget' on our feet
 hamaari tex niti kaa dakiyanooseepan amiron par zyada tex vaale deshon se kaaphi fark rakhata he
 With this tax, the government will get hardly 8,000 crore rupees in a year, but due to this, more assets will go to those countries where the tax rate is less i
e
 20 percent on average
 is ahm faisle se sampatti ko vaid dhang se bhi bharat se baahar le jane kii hode badhegi

 4,000 ke kareeb canada main, do hajaar switzparland or emirate (prayek) or ek hajaar, newjiland, greece, israel, portugal or spain (prayek) main bas gaye

 2018 main turki, france, euke or brazil se 2,000 se 4,000 super rich boria-bistar baandhakar ud gaye
 Earlier in 2017, around 7,000 Indian super rich settled abroad
 morgan stenle ne beete baras apane ek adhyayan main bataaya tha ki 2014 ke baad kareeb 23,000 samrudh log yaa parivaar bharat chhodkar videsh main ja based
 That is, on average 7,000-8,000 super rich were leaving India every year before the new budget wreaked havoc
 yah neerav modi, vijay maalya yaa mehul chokasee jaisaa aapraadhik palaayan nahin he balki vaid samruddhi kaa suvichaarit pravaas he
 It is important to understand this by leaving prejudice to the rich
 bharat chhodkar jane vaale super rich apana kaarobaar band nahin kar rahe hai
 They will earn property from here only
 apane kaarobaar par tex bhi denge lekin nijee sampatti ko kisi aise desh main ekatra karenge jahaan tex kam he yaa sampatti ke nivesh ke vaid raste uplabdh hai
 a multinational company does the same
 jaise ki amejan kaa bhartiya kaarobaar kareeb 16 arab dollar kaa he lekin iske maalik or duniya ke sabase amir udhyami, jeff bejos kii sampatti se bharat ko kuch nahin miltaa
 The super rich of India usually earn a lot from their business as the returns are quite good
 azim prem ji jaise kuch ek ko chhodkar koi bahut bada jan kalyaan nahin karte
 The government has to take legal and incentive measures to put them in public welfare
 tex kii maar ke kaaran inkaa desh chhodana nitigat vifaltaa he
 The government could not create opportunities to store, invest or consume their assets so that the money earned from India remains in India
 bharat kii samskruti samruddhi ko abhishaap nahin maanati balki isaki aradhana karti he
 Chanakya has been told that it is impossible to get property without property, no matter how much effort is made
 jaise hathi ko khinchne ke liye hathi kii jarurat hoti he thik usee tarah sampatti arjeet karne ke liye sampatti chahie

 During the rainy season, the oily skin is the most troublesome because during this time the humidity increases and the pores are closed

 But it should not be the same with you

 In such a situation, these measures will prove very beneficial for you

 Cleaning and scrubbing daily is very important for cleaning pores

 Apart from this, sugar and lemon paste, orange peel or coarsely ground almonds can also be used
 is paste se chehre kii massage karen uske baad chehre ko halke gunagune pani se dho len
 Add three teaspoons of oats to the face mask
 usamen ek chammach shahad or neembu ke ras kii kuch boonden mila len
 Mix them all well
 is paste ko chehre par laga kar aadhe ghante ke liye chhod den
 By applying this mask, the lost glow will return and the face will also look fresh

 Senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse, who resigned from the Fadnavis cabinet after being accused of corruption, has given big hints
 unhone kaha he ki kisi par ek party kaa permanent thappa nahin hota he
 Questions have started to arise from Khadse's statement whether he is going to join BJP and join another party
 ye sawaal isliye bhi he ki kyonki leva patel samudaay ke jis kaarykram main khadse ne yah baat kahi he, vahaan congress ke purv saansad ulhas patil bhi maujuud the
 Congress leader Ulhas Patil said during the program that injustice has been done to Eknath Khadse
 aisa kehete hue patil ne khadse ko congress kaa haath thaamne kaa ofer tak de diya
 What Khadse said: Speaking among his community in Bhusaval, Eknath Khadse said, 'to strengthen the community, all have to unite and fight against injustice
 ek baat sahi he ki ekajute rahane ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he
 Politics has to be kept separate in the struggle for life
 chaahe dow patil kii party ho yaa meri, kisi ke paas koi sthaayee stamp nahin he ki vah ek hi party main rahegaa
 No one can guess this
 isliye ise halke main na len
 'let me tell you that the statement of Eknath Khadse is also considered important because he has received an invitation from the Congress to hold hands in public
 purv mukhyamantri ashok chavaan bhi unhen congress main shaamil hone kaa ofer de chuke hai
 Khadse had to leave the ministry after being named in the MIDC land scam, after which he has been continuously talking about injustice

 ham is bare main gambhirthapurvak kaam karen aisa sankalp lekar yahaan se jaayen tabhi shaheedon ko sachhee shradhanjali hogi or aatankwaad yaa naksalwad jaisi samasya ko ham samaapt karne kii disha main aage bad sakate hai
 My dear countrymen, ham kab tak sachchaaiyon se munh modate rahenge
 i want to share an information in front of you, and after listening to it you will either laugh or your anger will erupt
 sarkaar ke paas darj kii gai jaankaree ke hisaab se desh main sirf 24 lakh log yah maanate hai ki unki aay 10 lakh rupee salanaa se zyaada he
 Will this thing come down the throat of a countryman? 
 
 ? You will also see big rooms, big vehicles around you
 desh ke bade-bade shaharon ko hi dekhen to kisi ek shahar main aapako salanaa 10 lakh se adhik aay vaale lakhon log mil jaaenge
 Don't you think that the movement for honesty needs to be given more strength for the betterment of the country
 bhrashtachar, kaale dhan ke khilaaf is ladaai kii safalataa ke kaaran yah charchaa bahut swaabhaavik he ki ab beyimaanon kaa kya hoga, beyimaanon par kya beetegi, beyimaanon ko kya sazaa hogi
 Brothers and sisters, law, will work law, with full rigor
 lekin sarkaar ke liye is baat kii bhi praathamikta he ki eemaandaaron ko madad kaise mili, suraksha kaise mili, eemaandaaree kii zindagi bitaane waalon kii kathinaayee kaise kam ho
 How can honesty be more prestigious
 yah sarkaar sajjanon kii mitra he or durjanon ko sajjanta ke raste par lautaane ke liye upyukt vaataavaran ko taiyaar karne ke paksh main he
 It is also a bitter truth that people have bitter experiences related to government systems, some government officials and red tape
 is katu satya ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 Who can deny that officers have more responsibility than citizens, small and big people sitting in government, and so whether it is central government, state government or local body, it is the responsibility of all that ordinary people
 May the right to be protected, the help of the believers and the dishonest be isolated
 doston, It is a well-known fact all over the world that people dealing with terrorism, Naxalism, Maoism, counterfeit currency, drug trade, human trafficking, depend on black money
 yah samaaj or sarkaron ke liye nasoor ban gaya tha
 This one decision has hurt all these deeply
 aaj kaaphi sankhya main noujvaan mukhyadhara main laut rahe hai
 If we remain aware, we will be able to save our children from returning to those paths of violence and atrocities
 is abhiyaan kii safalataa is baat main bhi he ki arthvyavastha kii mukhyadhara se baahar jo dhan tha, vah bainkon ke madhyam se arthvyavastha kii mukhyadhara main waapas aa gaya he
 The events of the last few days have proved that for unscrupulous people who find ways of cunning, further avenues have been closed
 technology ne isamen bahut badi seva kii he
 Even habitually dishonest people, due to the power of technology, will have to come out of the black business and follow the law and rule in the mainstream
 saathiyon, Bank employees have united day and night during this period
 hajaaron mahila bank karmchaaree bhi der raat tak rukkar is abhiyaan main shaamil rahi hai
 The people working in the post office, bank friends, all have done commendable work
 haa, aapke is bhageerath prayaas ke bich, kuch bainkon main kuch logon ke gambhir aparaadh bhi saamne aae hai
 At some places, government employees have also committed serious crimes and habitual efforts have been made to take advantage of habit
 inhen bakhsha nahin jayega
 It is a golden opportunity for the country's banking system
 is aitihaasik avasar par main desh ke sabhi bainkon se aagrahpurvak ek baat kahana chahta hum
 History bears witness that the banks of India had never before come to such a large amount of money in such a short time
 bainkon kii swatantraaa kaa aadar karte hue meraa aagrah he ki bank apni paramparaagat praathamiktaaon se baahar nikalakar ab desh ke garib, nimna madhya varg or madhyam varg ko centre main rakhkar apane kaary kaa aayojan kare
 When Hindustan is celebrating the birth centenary year of Poor Deendayal Upadhyay as the year of poor welfare, banks should not let this opportunity of public interest go away by hand
 ho sake, utana jaldi lokhit main uchit nirnay karen or uchit kadam uthaaen
 When a policy is made with a definite goal, plans are made, the beneficiary is empowered, as well as its immediate and far-reaching consequences
 pai-pai par baarik najar rahati he, isse achche parinaamon kii sambhaavna bhi pakki hoti he
 Village-poor-farmers, Dalits, oppressed, exploited, deprived and women, the stronger they are, the more economically they stand on their feet, the stronger the country becomes and the faster the development
 sabakaa saath - sabakaa vikaas : is dhyey vaakya ko charitaarth karne ke liye navvarsh kii purv sandhya par desh ke sava sau karod nagarikon ke liye sarkaar kuch nai yojanaayen laa rahi he
 Friends, even after so many years of independence, millions of poor people in the country do not have a home of their own
 jab arthvyavastha main kaala dhan badha, to madhyam varg kii pahunch se ghar bhi khareednaa dur ho gaya tha
 The government has taken some major decisions to help poor, lower middle class, and middle class people buy houses
 ab pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat shaharon main is varg ko nae ghar dene ke liye do nai scimen banaai gai hai
 Under this, a rebate of 4 percent in interest on loans up to Rs 9 lakh will be given for building a house in 2017 and a 3 percent discount on interest on loans up to Rs 12 lakh
 isi tarah sarkaar ne pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat gaanvon main banane vaale gharon kii sankhya ko badha diya he
 That is, 33 percent more houses will be built than the ones to be built earlier
 gaanvon ke nimna madhyam varg or madhyam varg ke logon kii zaruuraton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ek nai yojana shuru kii ja rahi he
 In 2017, the people of the village who want to build or expand their house, want to build one or two rooms, one floor above, will be given a 3 percent interest exemption in loans up to Rs 2 lakh
 
 doston, beete dinon chaaron taraf aisa vaataavaran bana diya gaya tha ki desh kii krishi barbaad ho gai he
 The farmers of my country have given the answer to those who create such an environment
 pichley saal kii tulana main is varsh rabi kii buvaai 6 pratishat zyaada hui he
 The fertilizer is also raised by 9 percent
 sarkaar ne is baat kaa lagaataar dhyaan rakhaa ki kisaanon ko beej kii dikkat na ho, khaad kii dikkat na ho, karj lene main pareshaani na aae
 Now some more important decisions have also been taken in the interest of the peasant brothers
 district kooparative central bank or primary sosayadi se jin kisaanon ne kharif or rabi kii buvaai ke liye karj liya tha, us karj ke 60 din kaa byaaj sarkaar vahan karegi or kisaanon ke khaaton main transfar karegi
 Measures have been taken to enable farmers to get more loans from cooperative banks and societies
 naabard ne pichley maheene 21,000 karod rupee kii vyavastha kii thi
 Now the government is adding about Rs 20,000 crore to it, almost doubling it
 is rakam ko naabard, kooparative bank or societiz ko kam byaaj par degaa or isse naabard ko jo aarthik nuksaan hoga he, use bhi sarkaar vahan karegi
 The government has also decided that in the next three months three crore Kisan Credit Cards will be converted into RUPAY cards
 kisaan credit card main ek kami yah thi ki paise nikaalane ke liye bank janaa padataa tha
 Now when the Kisan Credit Card will be converted into RUPAY card, the farmer will be able to buy and sell from his card anywhere
 bhaaiyon or bahanon, jis prakaar desh kii arthvyavastha main krishi kaa mahatv he, usee prakaar vikaas or rojgaar ke liye laghu or madhyam udyog, jise MSME bhi kehete hai, kaa bhi mahatvapurn yogadan he
 Keeping this in mind, the government has taken some decisions for this sector, which will be helpful in increasing employment
 sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki chote kaarobaariyon ke liye credit guarantee 1 karod rupee se badhaakar 2 karod rupee karegi
 The Government of India through a trust guarantees to banks that you give loans to small traders, we guarantee
 ab tak yah niyam tha ki ek karod rupee tak ke lone ko cover kiya jaataa tha
 Now loans up to Rs 2 crore will be covered by credit guarantee
 NBFC yani non-banking financial company se diya gaya lone bhi isamen cover hoga
 This decision of the government will give more loans to small shopkeepers, small industries
 guarantee kaa kharch centre sarkaar dwaara vahan karne ke kaaran in par byaaj dar bhi kam hogi
 The government has also asked banks to increase the cash credit limit for small industries from 20 percent to 25 percent
 iske alaava digital madhyam se hue tranjection par varking capital lone 20 pratishat se badhaakar 30 pratishat tak karne ko kaha gaya he
 Many people associated with this sector made cash deposits in November
 bainkon ko kaha gaya he ki varking capital tay karte vakt iskaa bhi sangyaan len
 a few days ago, the government also decided to give big tax relief to small traders
 jo kaarobaari saal main 2 karod rupee tak kaa vyapaar karte hai, unke tex kii gananaa 8 pratishat aay ko maanakaraki jaati thi
 Now tax on digital transaction of such merchant will be calculated assuming 6 percent income
 is tarah unka tex kaaphi kam ho jayega
 Friends, mudra yojana kii safalataa nishchit taur par bahut utsahvarddhak rahi he
 Last year, nearly three and a half crore people have taken advantage of it
 dalit-adivasee-pichhadon, evam mahilaon ko praathamikta dete hue sarkaar kaa, ise ab dabl karne kaa iraadaa he
 a nationwide scheme is also being introduced for pregnant women
 ab desh ke sabhi, 650 se zyaada, jilon main sarkaar garbhvatee mahilaon ko aspataal main panjikaran or delivery, tikaakaran or paushtik aahaar ke liye 6,000 rupee kii aarthik madad karegi
 This amount will be transferred to the account of pregnant women
 desh main matra mrityudar ko kam karne main is yojana se badi sahaayta milegi
 Presently, the scheme was being run under pilot project in only 53 districts of the country with a financial support of 4,000
 sarkaar varisht nagarikon ke liye bhi ek skim shuru karne ja rahi he
 Banks often reduce the interest rate (interest rate) on deposits when more money comes into the bank
 varisht nagarikon par iskaa prabhaav na ho, isliye 7
 Interest rate of 8 percent will be secured annually for 10 years on an amount up to Rs 5 lakh
 byaaj kii yah raashi varisht naagarik har maheene paa sakate hai
 Whenever there is discussion of corruption, black money, then politicians, political parties, election expenses, all these things remain at the center of discussion
 ab vakt aa chukaa he ki sabhi rajaneta or raajnneetik dal desh ke eemaandaar nagarikon kii bhaawanaaon kaa aadar karen, janata ke aakrosh ko samajhen
 It is true that political parties have also made meaningful efforts to improve the system from time to time
 sabhi dalon ne milakar, swechha se apane upar bandhanon ko sweekaar kiya he
 Today, it is essential that all politicians and political parties - aside from HOLIER THAN THOU - take the right steps towards freeing political parties from corruption and black money, while sitting together and prioritizing transparency
 hamaare desh main saamaanya naagarik se lekar raashtrapati ji tak sabhi ne loksabhaa-vidhansabha kaa chunaav saath-saath karaae jane ke bare main kabhi na kabhi kaha he
 It is supported by the ongoing election cycle, the economic burden arising from it, and the freedom from the burden on the administrative system
 ab samay aa gaya he ki is par bahes ho, rasta khoja jaae
 There has always been a place for every positive change in our country
 ab digital len-dein ko lekar bhi samaaj main kaaphi sakaaratmak parivartan dekha ja rahaa he
 More and more people are joining it
 kal hi sarkaar ne baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar ke naam par digital tranjection ke liye puri tarah ek swadeshi plateform - BHIM launch kiya he
 BHIM means Bharat Interface for Money
 main desh ke yuvaaon se, vyapaaree varg se, kisaanon se aagrah kahata hum ki BHIM se zyaada se zyaada juden
 Friends, the developments that took place after Diwali, decisions were made, policies were made - economists would evaluate them, but it would be better if the sociologists of the country also evaluate this whole development, decisions and policies
 ek raashtra ke rup main bharat kaa gaanv, garib, kisaan, yuva, padhe-likhe, anpadh, purush-mahila sabane apratim dhairya or lokshakti kaa darshan karaayaa he
 After some time, the new year of 2017 will start
 aaj se 100 varsh purv 1917 main mahatma gandhi ke netritv main champaran main pehali baar satyagrah kaa andolan aarambh hua tha
 These days we have seen that even after 100 years, positive values of truth and good are valued in our country
 aaj mahatma gandhi nahin hai, parantu unka vah maarg, jo hamen satya kaa aagrah karne ke liye prerit karata he, vah sarvaadhik upyukt he
 On the occasion of the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha, we will once again become followers of truth by remembering Mahatma Gandhi, then there will be no difficulty in moving forward on the track of truth and goodness
 bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf is ladaai ko hamen rukne nahin dena he
 The insistence of truth is a guarantee of complete success
 sava sau karod kaa desh ho, 65 pratishat jansankhya 35 saal se kam umr ke naujavaanon kii ho, saadhan bhi hon, sansaadhan bhi hon or samarthy main koi kami na ho, aise hindustan ke liye koi kaaran nahin he, ki vah ab peeche rah jaae
 The comments nae varsh kii nai kiran, nai safaltaaon kaa sankalp lekar aa rahi he
 Come, let us all go together and go over obstacles
 
 
 ek nae ujjwal bhavishya kaa nirmaan karen
 Jai Hind
 
 
 !!! How long will we keep turning away from the truth
 main aapke saamne ek jaankaree saajha karnaa chahta hum, or ise sunne ke baad yaa to aap hans padenge yaa phir aapkaa gussa foot padegaa
 According to the information filed with the government, only 24 lakh people in the country believe that their income is more than Rs 10 lakh annually
 kya kisi deshvasi ke gale yah baat utregi
 
 
 The aap bhi apane aasapaas badi-badi kothiyaan, badi-badi gadiyon ko dekhte honge
 If you look at the big cities of the country, then in one city you will find lakhs of people with income above 10 lakh annually
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki desh kii bhalaai ke liye eemaandaaree ke andolan ko or adhik takat dene kii zarurat he
 Because of the success of this fight against corruption, black money, it is very natural to discuss what will happen to the unscrupulous, what will be done to the unscrupulous, what will be the punishment for the unscrupulous
 bhaaiyon or bahanon, kanoon, kanoon kaa kaam karegaa, puri kathorta se karegaa
 But the government also has priority on how to help the believers, how to get security, how to reduce the hardship of those who live a life of honesty
 eemaandaaree adhik pratishthit kaise ho
 This government is the friend of the gentlemen and is in favor of creating a suitable environment to return the wicked to the path of gentleness
 vaise yah bhi ek kadava satya he ki logon ko sarkaar kii vyavasthaaon, kuch sarkari afasaron or lalaphitaashahee se jude katu anubhav hote rahete hai
 This harsh truth cannot be denied
 is baat se koun inkaar kar saktaa he ki nagarikon se zyaada jimmedaari afasaron kii he, sarkaar main baithe chote-bade vyakti kii he, or isliye chaahe centre sarkaar ho, rajya sarkaar ho yaa phir sthaneey nikaay, sabakaa daayitv he ki saamaanya se saamaanya vyakti ke adhikaar kii raksha ho, eemaandaaron kii madad ho or beyimaan alag-thalag hon
 Friends, puri duniya main yah ek sarvamaanya tathy he ki aatankwaad, naksalwad, maowad, jaali note kaa kaarobaar karne vaale, drugs ke dhandhe se jude log, maanav taskari se jude log, kaale dhan par hi nirbhar rahete hai
 It became a canker for society and governments
 is ek nirnay ne in sab par gahari chot pahunchaai he
 Today, a large number of youth are returning to the mainstream
 agar ham jaagruk rahen, to apane bacchon ko hinsa or atyaachaar ke un raaston par waapas lautne se bachaa paaenge
 The success of this campaign also lies in the fact that the money that was outside the mainstream of the economy has returned to the mainstream of the economy through banks
 pichley kuch dinon kii ghatnaon se yah siddh ho chukaa he ki chaalaaki ke raste khojane vaale beyimaan logon ke liye, aage ke raste band ho chuke hai
 Technology has done a great service in this
 adatan beyimaan logon ko bhi ab technology kii takat ke kaaran, kaale kaarobaar se nikalakar kanoon-niyam kaa paalan karte hue mukhyadhara main aana hoga
 Colleagues, bank karmchaariyon ne is dauraan din-raat ek kiye hai
 Thousands of women bank employees have also stayed till late night and are involved in this campaign
 post offis main kaam karne vaale log, bank mitra, sabhi ne saraahneey kaam kiya he
 Yes, in the midst of your Bhagiratha effort, some people have also witnessed serious crimes in some banks
 kahin-kahin sarkari karmchaariyon ne bhi gambhir aparaadh kiye hai or adatan phayda uthaane kaa nirlajj prayaas bhi hua he
 They will not be spared
 yah desh ke banking system ke liye ek svarnim avasar he
 On this historic occasion, i want to urge all the banks of the country to say one thing
 itihaas gavaah he ki hindustan ke bainkon ke paas ek saath itani badi maatra main, itane kam samay main, dhan kaa bhandar pehle kabhi nahin aayaa tha
 Respecting the independence of banks, i urge that the bank move out of its traditional priorities and now conduct its work keeping the poor, lower middle class and middle class in the country at the center
 hindustan jab pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay janm shatabdi varsh ko garib kalyaan varsh ke rup main manaa rahaa he, tab bank bhi lokhit ke is avasar ko haath se na jane den
 As soon as possible, take appropriate decisions and take appropriate steps in public interest
 jab nishchit lakshya ke saath niti banati he, yojanaayen banati hai to labhaarthi kaa shashaktikaran to hota hi he, saath hi saath iske taatkaalik or doorgaami fal bhi milte hai
 Pie-pie is closely monitored, it also ensures the possibility of good results
 gaanv-garib-kisaan, dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit or mahilaayein, jitani shashakt hongi, aarthik rup se apane pairon par khadi hongi, desh utana hi majboot banegaa or vikaas bhi utana hi tej hoga
 Sabka Saath - Everybody's Development: On the eve of New Year, the government is bringing some new schemes for 1
25 billion citizens of the country to make this motto
 doston, swatantraaa ke itane saal baad bhi desh main lakhon garibon ke paas apana ghar nahin he
 When black money increased in the economy, buying homes was also far removed from the reach of the middle class
 garib, nimna madhyam varg, or madhyam varg ke log ghar kharid saken, iske liye sarkaar ne kuch bade faisle liye hai
 Now, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, two new schemes have been created to give new homes to this class in cities
 iske tahat 2017 main ghar banane ke liye 9 lakh rupee tak ke karj par byaaj main 4 pratishat kii chhot or 12 lakh rupee tak ke karj par byaaj main 3 pratishat kii chhot di jaaegi
 Similarly, the government has increased the number of houses built in villages under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 yani jitne ghar pehle banane vaale the, usase 33 pratishat zyaada ghar banaae jaaenge
 Keeping in mind the needs of the lower middle class and middle class people of the villages, a new scheme is being launched
 2017 main gaanv ke jo log apane ghar kaa nirmaan karnaa chaahate hai yaa vistaar karnaa chaahate hai, ek-do kamare or bananaa chaahate hai, upar ek manzil bananaa chaahate hai, unhen 2 lakh rupee tak ke rin main 3 pratishat byaaj kii chhot di jaaegi
 Friends, in the past, such an environment was created that the country's agriculture has been destroyed
 aisa vaataavaran banane waalon ko jawaab mere desh ke kisaanon ne hi de diya he
 Rabi sowing has been 6% higher this year compared to last year
 fertilizer bhi 9 pratishat zyaada uthaaya gaya he
 The government kept in mind that farmers should not face any problem of seeds, no problem of fertilizer, and should not have any problem in taking loans
 ab kisaan bhaaiyon ke hit main kuch or ahm nirnay bhi liye gaye hai
 60 days interest will be borne by the government from farmers who took loans for sowing kharif and rabi from District Cooperative Central Bank and Primary Society and transfer it to farmers' accounts
 kooparative bank or societiz se kisaanon ko or zyaada karj mil sake, iske liye upaay kiye gaye hai
 NABARD had arranged Rs 21,000 crore last month
