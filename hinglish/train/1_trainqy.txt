 Shire Rahat Indauri is a special face of Akshatak Aajtak this time with his biographer Deepak Rouhani who will go under the pretext of this book
 ve pehle bhisahitya ajatakamen aa chuke hai or is baar unki pehali baar chap rahi aadhikarik jeevani kaa locarpan bhisahitya ajtak 2019ke manch par hoga
 Criticist Dr Om Nischal has written this review especially for Sahitya Aaj Tak
 ek vakt manchon mehphilon kavi sammelnon main niraj jaise kavi aprihaary hua karte the
 As if they are not there, then what is the poet conference and what is Mushaira
 aaj yahi baat raahat indori ko lekar kii jaati he
 The poetry of the life-giving relief at Mushayar Kavi Conferences of the country and their speculations are even today which are not in their contemporaries
 unke tamaam sher inkilabi najariye se itane papular ho chuke hai ki raahat kaa naam aate hai ve sher jubaan par numaayan ho uthte hai
 Today is a period of biographies, biographies, but in this also the names of celebrities are at the top
 filmi duniya ke kirdaar is myne main baaji maar le jate hai
 But the poet who carves out Ashra with the help of his experience and sensation about time, society, life, reviews are there but his biographies are written very little
 hindi ke lekhakon main jin logon par aisa kaam hua unki sankhya bahut kam he
 Writing of Nirala's Literature Sadhana on Nirala in three volumes is not the same example that Ram Vilas Sharma drew
 bade bade lekhak hue yashpal, shrilaal shukla, prasad, pant, mahadevi, agyeya
 
 
 But no biography zyada se zyada un par monograph aae honge
 No biography of Neeraj has been revealed
 un par sampadit ek kaaphi teble book jarur he jabaki gaye saat dashakon tak manch par niraj ne badshahath kii he
 Rahat Indauri is fortunate in modern Urdu poetry in the sense that his biography has been written by Dr
 Deepak Rouhani, the scholar of Urdu poetry, a Hindi writer, who has read a single relief
 is jeevani par raahat kaa kahana he ki '' ek aise gatte se kaate hue be-tarateeb tukade, jo aadhi sadi se garmi, sardi, barish, dhoop-chhaanv jaise anaam or anjaan mausamon se ankhen milaate-milaate boodha ho gaya, yaa yun kahiye ki is kitaab ke ziyaadaatar kaagaz itane bhig chuke hai ki is par maujuud taharir par lagane ko taiyaar he, lekin is kitaab ke lekhak kii zid ne ise tarateebavaar banane kii mukammal koshish kii he
 Relief on opening a little bit of interest makes it easier to identify the picture of Indore
 ''pratapgarh se indore koi sidhi train nahin jaati
 If you want to go then go from Allahabad or Lucknow
 us par bhi tikat kii har vakt maaramaari
 But it was impossible without going to Indore
 duusare raahat kis vakt kahaan honge
 Don't know it kyonki raahat kii maang desh videsh har jagah he
 Here Deepak did not have any kind of job, so despite the money, but despite all this, Deepak Rouhani did not lose his courage
 redgrab books ke prakaashak dost venus kesari ne jab unase yah jeevani likhane kii peshkash kii, to deepak ke liye yah bahut hi ahm kshan tha
 Venus himself specializes in Urdu ghazals and has written his advice on the gazal of Urdu by writing an excellent book
 isamen madad kii venus ke saajheedaar shaayar prakaashak paraag agarwal ne, jo khud indore ke hi rahane vaale hai

 unki or ruhani kii jugalbandi ne indore main raahat kii sohabat kaa jam kar laabh uthaaya tathaa raahat ke beton satluj va faijal indori ne bhi is anushthan main puri madad kii
 On writing, Rahat ji corrected the facts from place to place and thus it became an official biography, like a biography and a contemporary poet is yet to come
 sahitya ajtak 2019ke manch par is jeevani ke locarpan ke liye bhi prakashkon ne gambhir prayaas kiya
 This is the first release of Rahat Sahab's biography on any platform
 jeevanikar deepak ruhanideepak kii paidaaish avadh bhadaarikalan,lalganj kii he jahaan khantee avadhi boli jaati he
 But from the very beginning Deepak was fond of poetry, so he also got the training of Urdu
 shuruaati daur main kasbe main unka pragnadohan bahut hua, bahuton ke bauddhik kirdaar ko sanvaarane main yahaan tak ki bahuton kii piechdi likhavane main unka bahut yogadan rahaa par ''peeche chal kar aage nikle jane kitne log, hamen hujuri raas na ai laga kalam kaa rog''
 
 
 They kept wandering in search of employment
 par garbili garibi ke in dinon main bhi unhen adab kii duniya ke bade khwab aate
 So they thought that when starting a magazine, they could extract some issues of 'ghazalkar'
 ghazal par na keval ek sanjeeda magazine balki urdu shaayari kii salaahiyat se bhari aisi patrika shaayad hi koi or ho
 He was also interested in the translation of Urdu literature
 jab unhone shamshurrahman faruki kii ek pustak 'mir kii kavita or bhartiya saundaryabodh' kaa bahut chunauteepurn anuwaad bhartiya gyanpith ke liye kiya or aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay ke percian vibhaag ke purv vibhaagadhyaksh vaaris kirmani kii 'gumti nadi' sheershak aatmakatha kaa anuwaad bhi to deepak ke kad kaa ahsaas hua
 Now, when Rahat Saab's biographical work came to be completed two years ago, like the reliefs of Rahat Saab also flourished and Deepak has become an Assistant Professor in Madhubani and from his biography on Rahat Sahab he is also becoming a writer
 Huh
 raahat sahab kii jeevani likhane kaa khyal man main kaise aayaa, poochne par deepak ruhani ne kaha ki raahat sahab kii shaayari se to bahut pehle se taalluk tha par raahat sahab kii jeevani likhane kaa khyaal bhai paraag agarwal ne sujhaayaa
 He had an old contact with Rahat Sahab
 paraag indore ke padosi zile dhar ke rahanevaale hai or raahat sahab ke bahut prasanshak hai
 i could not even imagine that Rahat Sahab could meet a man like me and that too to tell the story of his life
 do saal kii athak mehnat ke baad puri raahat sahab kii is jeevani ke liye unke saath deepak kii indore main lagbhag aath yaa das baar baithak hui or do baar lakhanu main
 Two to three times from relatives, some times more than some friends
 rishtedaaron se milane devas kai baar janaa padaa to inke ek bachapan ke ek dost se milane pune bhi janaa padaa
 Often people write on a cine celebrity because of his specialty, what made him so special as a poet that he became the centerpiece of this biography
 deepak kehete hai, ek shaayar ke rup main raahat sahab main ek-do khasiyaten nahin balki bahut sari khasiyaten hai, jinka kramvaar ullekh is kitaab main aayaa he
 Rahat Sahab's personal nature is of paramount importance among the main features
 iske alaava unki loktantric patibaddhta, raajnneetik jaagrukta, bhashaai chetana, paramparaagat vishyon kaa rakh-rakhaav, sher pesh karne kaa andaaz or apni vichaardhaara ke prati taumr nishthavan bane rahanaa bhi unki kuch ahm khasiyaten hai
 i ask them that people rarely open their personal lives in interviews, how did Rahat Saab speak on such a personal question
 ''nijee jivan ke bahut saare sawaalon kaa unhone khulkar jawaab diya
 He did not show anything in his nature like hiding anything, but i could not write openly even after knowing many things from him, the fact is that he did not hide anything about any of his Aib, "deepak answered my question
 said
 biography likhte hue aisi koi baat jo man ko chhu gayi ho, aisi koi ghatana jo yaadgaar ban gayi ho, deepak bole, '' biography likhte samay kai baaten aisi saamne aayin jo dil ko chhu gayin
 Some things were told about their relatives and friends and some were told about themselves
 khaaskar ve baaten dil ko adhik chhu gayin jo bachapan or javaani main sangharsh ke dinon kii thim
 From childhood, he became mute in earning and struggled in what way he reached here, saying that he used to get emotional
 is jeevani se puri tarah khush hai raahataksar lekhak apane moolyankan ko lekar aalochakon se aashwast nahin rahete
 The author feels the most relief that someone understands them properly
 aaj jab pustak saamne he, raahat saab ke jivan ke aakhyaan ke saare panne khule hai to jaanane kii jigyaasa hoti he ki ise pard kar is par raahat saab kii kya raay hogi
 Rahat Saab says in a video, "the clout of my identity and my identity is so scattered that in reaching out to me, i myself have passed more than half a century but a great enemy came
 kaaphi dinon se khwaahish thi ki koi aisa shaks mili koi aisa tarika ho jo meri pahchaan logo tak pahuchanemen or khud mujh tak pahunchane main meri madad kare
 This work was unfortunate, but i met a happy lamp Deepak with a person who tried to identify me by touching my soul and gave a book which i felt after reading it every time
 Was not aware of this aspect of personality or design
 ye ek bada karnama tha
 i offer them my congratulations for this
 mere khandaan ke darjanon log aise the ki jinase meri mulaakaat tak nahin hui
 He was introduced to me by Taruf Deepak in this book and this one is almost a complete document of my life and i want people to read this book and recognize me and even after me, like Mir in the middle of a track in Lucknow's city station May not be suppressed, but people can know me by quoting that here is the place where the relief is buried
 ''raahat saab ne is kitaab ko padhate hue ise pachaas ke dashak kii ek blike white film kaha he
 Relief said, "I have a feeling that i have gone to some extent to show the spectacle which has been done in front of me
" ye kitaab pachaas-saath ke dashak kii blike and white film kii tarah he jisamen koi pahachaani hui si tasviir kabhi awaz kho baithti he or kabhi chikh padati he, meri khwaahish he ki log is tasviir ko pahachaanen jise banane main uski koi koshish nahin jisaki tasviir he
 
 
 "relief sir says about this book that" The journey of Mushayars in my life in this book is more than half a century
 or in mushaairon main jo vaakyaat hue, jo haadasaat hue jo baaten huin logon se hui mulaakaaten huin inhen likhaa jaay yaa inhen kitaabi shakl di jaae to main samajhataa hum ek badi daastaan teyar hogi
 But Deepak did not shy away from these things and took all those nijal things without which my portrait could not be ready
 khushi kii baat yah he bahut si aisi chijen jo mujh tak hi nahin pahunchin thi yaa pahunchi bhi thim to main kai dafe bhul chukaa tha, wo isamen shaamil hai
 "I had a very long wish that such a book would come and this book is in our hands today
 ye ek tareeke kaa aisa tamaasha he jise main khud dekh bhi nahin paa rahaa hum or bayaan bhi nahin kar paa rahaa hum lekin mere hawaale ke saath mere naam ke saath, mere kunbe ke logon ke saath mere bacchon ke saath, mere parivaar ke saath, meri shaayari ke saath, mere mizaaj ke saath meri lugat ke saath, meri tasviir duniya tak pahunch rahi he, yah mere liye fakhr or aadar kii baat he
 "saying these words after reading his own biography of Rahat Sahab is not only a reward for his biographer Deepak Rouhani, but for his millions of loved ones, it is a journey of life that has come from many such moments of his life
 You will be able to see through which the poetry has flowered and Parwan climbed
 nau adhyyon main banty he yah jivaniis barsahitya ajatakamen raahat sahab kii jis jeevani kaa locarpan hoga unki jeevani deepak ruhani ne ruh se likhi he isamen andeh nahin
 Deepak has cherished every aspect of his public and caste life
 kul nau adhyyon main vibhakt is jeevani kaa har adhyay sheershak raahat saab ke kisi na kisi sher par aadhaarit he
 Often the poet or poet does not write his autobiography
 yevantushko kaha karte the ki kavi kii kavita hi uski aatmakatha he
 His autobiography also appears to be threaded in the poetry of relief
 unke sukh, dukh, unke ahsaasat sab unke jivan kaa hissaa hai
 
 
 Life which is as much in the poetry of poetry
 aise daraveshon se miltaa he hamaara shajra, meri bahaar mere ghar ke phooldaan main he, uski tasviir isi tarah mukammal hogi, meri gaphaj se bana zehan main koi tasviir, ghazal pheri laga kar bechata hum, raahate-indore: raahat indori, ye koi or hi kirdaar he tumhaari tarah, tumko raahat kii tabst kaa nahin andaja, rose pathar kii himaayat main ghazal kehete hai jaise puralutf or manikhej adhyyon ke saath parishisht main un par hue shodh kaary, sammaanon, filmon, tasveeron ko sanjoya gaya he
 Rahat was born on 1 January 1950 in Indore to the textile mill's employee Raftullah Qureshi and Maqbool Un Nisha Begum
 unki shuruaati talim nutan skool indore main hui
 He graduated from Islamia Karimiya College Indore in 1973 and obtained a phd in Urdu Literature from Bhopal University in 1985 after doing his MA in Urdu Literature from Barkatullah University, Bhopal in 1975
 baad main kuch samay tak raahat sahab ne indrakumar college, indore main urdu sahitya kaa adhyaapan kaary shuru kar diya
 But the preoccupations of poetry and mushairs could not keep Rahat Saheb bound for long and they resided in the hearts of the lovers of poetry abroad
 raahat or shaayari kii ek puri duniya is jeevani main sirf raahat hi nahin hai, ve hai, indore riyasat he, vahaan kaa maahaul he, khandaaree log hai, bhai bahan, sharike hayaat, bachche or naate rishtedaar bhi
 Even Deepak Rouhani has taken up the task of recording whoever knows the relief at all and has some important story of relief
 isiilie tinke tinke jod kar yah jo dhai sau panne kii jeevani he vah raahat ke bhuulebisare dinon kaa ek mukammal dastavej he
 Very few people would know that the life of relief has gone through struggles
 painting bhi unhone sikhi ki koi rojgaar mili
 His journey from Kalarthi to Rahat Studio is also in his part
 is safar main unke anek saathi rahe
 His live pictures are recorded here with him
 shaayari unhen koi viraasat main nahin mili
 He learned a lot from the adorable atmosphere of Indore and from the first Mushaira till today he has hoisted his identity in the whole world
 yahaan tak ki sangeet ke gharaanon kii tarah unhone indore kii shaayari kaa ek gharaana aabaad kiya
 Indore pen has its own identity in shayari
 ab tak raahat saab main kitne mushaayare padhe honge isaki ginati kar paanaa bhi mushkil he
 When the scent of his poetry reached Bollywood, touching his extreme popularity in Mushayars, he started writing songs in films too
 vahaan unhone nae tajurbaat hasil kiye
 Deepak has narrated many small stories of his life here
 koi milane aa jaae, iske liye unka darbar hameshaa khulaa rahata he
 Once upon a time he was in London with Morari Bapu
 baapu ne unke kamare main alag se khaane pine kii chijen bhijwa rakhin thim
 Rahat Saab used to eat something in his room due to sluggishness
 ve restarent main jaakar kuch kha saken ki isse pehle landan main rah rahe ek bhopal ke sajjan unase milane aa gaye
 a lot of time was spent with them in the cave without drinking
 ant main jab ve sajjan chale gaye or der tak unki koi khabar na hui to darwaja khulavaa kar dekha gaya to ve behosh mili
 Relief sir was sugar, in which it is necessary to eat at a short time
 us vakt unki beepi kaaphi lo thi
 The team of doctors corrected him somehow
 jab jonpur ke ek chote se stesan par raahat ne apane kapade dhoeaaj mushaairon main unki badshahath bhale ho aurasahitya aajatkajaise desh ke sabase shandaar saahitiyik manch par har saal unki upasthiti ho, par shuruaati daur kaa ek kissa unhone bayaan kiya he ki ek baar banaras mushayaremen janaa tha or lakhanu se jonpur hote hue banaras ja rahe the
 The cloth was the one that was worn and it was dirty
 doosraa tha nahin so jonpur se pehle jafarabad stesan par utar kar ek handpipe par unhone kapade dhoe sukhaye or unhen hi dubaara pahan kar koi duusari gaadi pakad kar banaras pahunche
 At that time, the payment was so low in Mushayars that it would be difficult to buy a type of cloth
 yah thi dushwariyaan uthaa kar adab ke haq main ek shaayar kaa sangharsh
 Even today, he does not embody power in poetry, but talks about the common man
 unki talkh shaayari sabko hajam nahin ho sakati par tarakkeepsand har shaks raahat kii shaayari kaa shaukeen he
 Often, while studying in Mushayars, they first try to identify the mindset and level of the audience and Samayin
 yadi talibaz janata hui to halke dhang kii shaayari se kaam chalaa lete hai
 But if there are serious listeners, then they open the treasury of classic level poetry one by one
 ek baar tufail chaturvedi ne unase kaha ki aap apni adbi gajalen manch par kyon nahin padhate to raahat saab ne kaha ki samayin hi aisa nahin chaahati
 Rahat started with Sanjida Shayari at Mushayara held in the auditorium the same night
 haal khamosh
 Reactionless, Rahat Saab looked at Tufail sitting in the corner and said Tufail, you were asking, not why i do not read mushayar
 dekh lo adab padhane par kya haal hota
 Now look, i am starting Mushaira from here
 phir raahat saab apane aajamaae khel par aa gaye or shrotaaon ke shor se sabhaagaar bhar uthaa
 Those who have been fond of Rahat Saheb, they will also see his enthusiasm this time on the stage of literature
 sirf shaayar hi nahin, ek grihasth bhipatni seemaa ne raahat saab ke bare main bataate hue kahati hai ki kiraaye kii cycle se aate jate hue bhi kabhi mujhe abhaavon kaa ahsaas nahi hone diya
 He took care of me all the time
 mere bolne se pehle jo cheez mujhe chahie wo hajir kar dete the
 Even the rented bicycle did not charge him because he knew the work of painting and when needed he used to make this work free for him
 pita kii aarthik haalat acchhee na thi iske liye jab ve nutan hiskool main padhaa karte the tabhi se paas main hi jyoti arts main kaam siikhnaa shurukar diya tha
 On coming home from school to eat and drink towards Jyoti Arts
 vahaan rang brush binar aadi ke kaam main jute jate
 For this, Chhagan Guru would keep whatever salary he gave, never asked for it
 yani raahat sirf shaayar hin nahin the ve ek khyaal rakhane vaale pati or pita kii sahaayta karne vaale ek yogya suputr or grihasth bhi the
 For four decades, the poetry of Shayari has been the poet who has spread the Urdu shayari across the world, creating a bridge between the relief class poetry and popular poetry
 anant kii ore cheharaa kar ke ajaan kii tarah shaayari main praan foonkane vaale raahat bheed main na keval alag pahchaan rakhte hai balki apni alag aawaaj ke kaaran bhi ve sune or saraahe jate hai
 The life of a poet is buried in the back of his poetry, how bright he is and how dirty it can be told by someone who writes on it
 deepak ne raahat kii jindagi main ek joardaar dastak di he unki is jeevani ke bahaane jo in dinon charchaa main he
 Their work is also going on in the second section, where the reliefs will come out of their lives and the country will also openly speak about the situation of the world and its contemporaries, that is what we expect
 to is baar raahat indori se milane kaa mauka
 Do not miss the opportunity to listen directly to them and get the book signed by them

 chhattisgarh ke naksal prabhavit kanker jile main gaanv tak vikaas kaa ujiyaara pahunchane ke liye police ne pahaad kaat kar sadak banane kaa duruh kaary kar dikhaaya he
 Previously, where it was difficult to walk to reach the top, now the motor car has started reaching, which has increased the confidence of the police
 chhattisgarh ke uttar bastar kanker jila mukhyalay se naksal prabhavit aamabera ilaake kii taraf badhen, to dakshin kii ore lagbhag 20 kilometre dur pahaado se ghiri mardakoti gram panchayat aapkaa swaagat karti he
 This village panchayat in the Valley region consists of a group of five villages covering the villages of Jurramari, Hiradah, Mardakoti, Malajkudum and Marrapi
 is kshetra kii prakritik sundarataa aapako jaise baandh hi leti he, lekin yahaan ke pahaado par based gaanvon main rahane vaale log bahut kathin paristhitiyon main jivan gujaarte hai
 One of these villages is Marrapi, which is situated on a hill about seven hundred meters high
 vahaan ab sadak he, bijli he, saaf pine kaa pani he, skool he or skool main shikshak hai
 But till six months ago all these basic facilities were a dream for the people here
 is sapane ko hakeekat main badalane kaa prayaas kiya he yahaan kii police ne
 Ramanand Kumetti, husband of Asita Kumetti, sarpanch of Mardakoti Gram Panchayat, says that this village has a population of 380, which has been settled for centuries
 kuch maheene pehle is gaanv tak pahunch paanaa hi sabase badi samasya thi
 There was a footpath to reach the village nestled atop the steep mountain
 is pagadendi se hokar lathi kaa sahaara lekar hi gramin yahaan se aate jate the
 Kumeti says that the village has a school up to the fifth grade but did not have a teacher there for a long time
 shikshak kii niyukti hoti thi tab vah kabhi kabhaar hi yahaan aate the kyonki unhen apni cycle yaa motorcycle pahaad ke neeche rakhkar paidal chadhaai karke skool tak pahunchnaa hota tha
 If someone became ill in the village, he had to be taken down with the help of Kanwar and then transported to the hospital by motorcycle or other means
 yahaan se najdiki aspataal kanker jila mukhyalay main he
 He said that while climbing and descending the mountain, people often fall and get seriously injured
 iske alaava gaanv main pine ke saaf pani kii vyavastha nahin thi
 There was no ration shop, no electricity
 matlab yah ki gaanv to tha, log bhi the, par unke liye kuch nahin tha
 But after November last year, change started here
 police ke sahyog se sadak bani, phir jila prashasan pahunchaa or ab to gaanv main handpump he, skool main shikshak hai, choti si kiraane kii dukaan bhi he
 Rasalu Ram Kavasi, the principal reader of the village's primary school, says that there are 34 students in the school
 vah abhi apane gaanv marrapi main padhaa rahe hai
 Earlier he was in Antagarh development block
 kavasi bataate hai ki vah marrapi main hi rahete hai isliye skool pahunchane main pareshaani nahin hoti
 But other teachers had to face trouble
 vah apana vaahan neeche gaanv main chhodte the or pahaad chadhakar skool pahunchate the
 The problem was aggravated during the rainy days
 vah bataate hai ki ek baar ek gramin ke biimaar hone par tokari main bithakar use neeche pahunchaaya gaya tha
 Superintendent of Police of Kanker district, KL Dhruv, who played an important role in cutting the hills and making development to the village, says that in September last year, he was transferred from Bijapur district to Kanker district
 jab vah yahaan naksaliyon ke khilaaf apni ranneeti bana rahe the tab tay kiya gaya ki graminon kaa dil jeeta jaae jisase vah mukhyadhara se na bhatak paaen
 During this time he got information about Marrapi and Jivalamari village situated at some distance
 marrapi or jeevalamaari gaanv ke gramin jab unase milane jila mukhyalay aae to gaanv tak sadak banane kii maang kii or unhen vahaan aane kaa nimantran diya
 Dhruv says that on reaching Marrapi village, the direct climb of the mountain made him realize the problem of the villagers and he intended to build a road there on the same day
 iske liye graminon ne bhi puure sahyog kaa bharosa dilaayaa
 The Superintendent of Police says that the work of paving the way to Marrapi started in November and police personnel, women commandos and villagers with mountain cutting machines got involved in this difficult task of constructing roads
 dhur naksal prabhavit is ilaake main gramin sadak nirmaan kaa kaary karte or police suraksha detii
 Police would camp in the area for a week, the road would be built and then come back
 yah silsilaa chalata rahaa or do maheene main lagbhag chah kilometre lambii sadak banakar taiyaar ho gai
 It was a dream come true for the villagers and policemen
 dhruv bataate hai ki sadak banane kaa kaam puraa hone ke baad yahaan is varsh janvari main jan samasya nivaaran shivi lagaaya gaya, jisamen aazaadee ke baad pehali baar koi colector is gaanv main pahunchaa
 In this camp, the district administration also assured the villagers to cooperate fully
 baad main gaanv main handpump lagaaya gaya, dhan kootane kii mashin lagaai gai or rashan kii dukaan kholane ke liye madad kii gai
 The Superintendent of Police says that during the construction of the road, Naxalites tried to incite the villagers against the police
 naksaliyon ne graminon se kaha ki sadak banane ke baad police yahaan shivi bana legi, lekin gaanv vaale jab unki baton main nahin aae to naksaliyon ne bhi sadak kaa virodh nahin kiya
 He says that the police has made the road, but if the road gets washed away due to rain, then the difficulties will increase again, so the district administration and forest department are being talked to build a paved road here
 ummid he jald hi yahaan pakki sadak kaa nirmaan shuru hoga
 Dhruv says that after building the road to Marrapi, people in the area have increased confidence in the police
 jeevalamaari tak sadak banane ke liye bhi pahaad kaatane kaa kaam shuru kar diya gaya he, kuch kaam shesh he
 After the construction of both these roads, villagers are now reaching out to the police seeking more help
 unhen ahsaas ho rahaa he ki sadak keval gaanv yaa shaharon ko hi nahin, balki dilon ko bhi jodatii he

 haalanki congress is manch par hogi yaa nahin, is par andeh he

 But there are questions beyond this

 aise main paanch november ke jashn main ab tak ek hi manch par mulaayam ke saath nitish kumaar, ajit singh or echdi devgauda samet kai or netaa jute sakate hai
 However, there is doubt whether the Congress will be on this platform or not
 na congress ko ab tak nyotaa gaya he, na shivpal upi main congress ke maujuuda ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ko pahchaanane ko taiyaar hai
 When NDTV asked him if Prashant Kishore was present when he met KC Tyagi, Shivpal said, "I don't know Prashant Kishore who he is
" 
 
 main to nyotaa dene gaya tha"
 The comments haalanki aise gathjod kaa jo pehla sawaal he, uskaa jawaab dene se sabhi batch rahe hai- mukhyamantri koun hoga
 There has been no talk on issues
 shivpal se mulaakaat ke baad jab ajit singh se poocha gaya ki kya gathjod ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par akhilesh yadav unhen manzur honge, to unhone kaha, "is par ham or shivpal baat karenge
 Why talk to you about it "
 jabaki ajit singh ke bete jayant choudhary ne enditivi se kaha, "mulaayam singh se ajit singh kii baat hui he
 The conversation is going well
 lekin muddon par yaa siton par abhi baat nahin hui he
 
 
 The alliance is far away "
 lekin is baat ke aage bhi sawaal hai
 Unlike the Congress and BSP, how successful will this front be - especially when there is fierce fighting within the Samajwadi Party's command and direction
 yahi nahin, jin mulaayam ne bihar main nitish kaa saath choda, un par duusare kitna bharosa karenge
 However, there is doubt whether the Congress will be on this platform or not
 na congress ko ab tak nyotaa gaya he, na shivpal upi main congress ke maujuuda ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ko pahchaanane ko taiyaar hai
 When NDTV asked him if Prashant Kishore was present when he met KC Tyagi , Shivpal said, "I don't know Prashant Kishore who he is
" 
 
 main to nyotaa dene gaya tha"
 The comments haalanki aise gathjod kaa jo pehla sawaal he, uskaa jawaab dene se sabhi batch rahe hai- mukhyamantri koun hoga
 There has been no talk on issues
 shivpal se mulaakaat ke baad jab ajit singh se poocha gaya ki kya gathjod ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par akhilesh yadav unhen manzur honge, to unhone kaha, "is par ham or shivpal baat karenge
 Why talk to you about it "
 jabaki ajit singh ke bete jayant choudhary ne enditivi se kaha, "mulaayam singh se ajit singh kii baat hui he
 The conversation is going well
 lekin muddon par yaa siton par abhi baat nahin hui he
 
 
 The alliance is far away "
 lekin is baat ke aage bhi sawaal hai
 Unlike the Congress and BSP, how successful will this front be - especially when there is fierce fighting within the Samajwadi Party's command and direction
 yahi nahin, jin mulaayam ne bihar main nitish kaa saath choda, un par duusare kitna bharosa karenge
 However, everyone is avoiding answering the first question of such alliance - who will be the chief minister
 na muddon par koi baat hui he
 After meeting Shivpal, when Ajit Singh was asked if Akhilesh Yadav would approve as the alliance's chief ministerial candidate, he said, "we and Shivpal will talk on this
" aapse is bare main kyon baat karen"
 Whereas Ajit Singh's son Jayant Chaudhary told NDTV, "there is talk of Mulayam Singh to Ajit Singh
 baatcheet acchhee chal rahi he
 But issues or seats have not been discussed yet
 
 
 gathjod abhi dur he"
 But there are questions beyond this
 congress or bispi se alag ye morcha kitna kaamyaab hoga- khaaskar tab jab samaajawaadee party kii kaman or disha ko lekar bheetar hi ghamaasan jari he
 Not only this, how much others will trust Mulayam who left Nitish in Bihar
 lekin is baat ke aage bhi sawaal hai
 Unlike the Congress and BSP, how successful will this front be - especially when there is fierce fighting within the Samajwadi Party's command and direction
 yahi nahin, jin mulaayam ne bihar main nitish kaa saath choda, un par duusare kitna bharosa karenge

 After RBI and CBI, now another big institution has raised questions on the Modi government in gestures
 soochna ayukta shridhar aacharulu ne kaha ki jaanboojhkar lone nahin chukaane vaale difoltaron kii suchi saunpane ke sambandh main hamen artiai mili thi
 Despite the order of the Supreme Court, RBI did not make this list public
 isse pehle bhi aisi hi ek artiai lagaai gai thi, jisamen soochna ayukta ne naam ujagar karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 a day earlier, the CIC had issued a show cause notice to RBI Governor Urjit Patel for not complying with the Supreme Court's decision to intentionally disclose the list of non-repayable bank debt
 siaisi ne iske saath hi pradhanmantri karyaalay, vitt mantralay or bhartiya rigerv bank (arabiai) se kaha he ki ve fanse hue karj par arabiai ke purv governor raghuram rajan kaa patr saarvajanik karen
 In spite of the Supreme Court order, angry with the RBI for not providing information on the names of those who took loans of Rs 50 crore and more and knowingly did not repay it, the CIC asked Patel to tell that the verdict was not followed
 Why not impose a maximum penalty on them for not doing it
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne tatkaaleen soochna ayukta shailesh gandhi ke us faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa tha, jisamen unhone jaanboojhkar lone nahin chukaane waalon ke naamon kaa khulaasa karne ko kaha tha

 When both these batsmen were at the crease, it seemed that India would be successful in drawing this match but the team was reduced to 283 after losing their last seven wickets for 21 runs and lost the series 4–0
 tendulkar apane karier main nauveen baar nervas ninties kaa shikaar hue
 For England, Graeme Swann took a spell of spin and took six wickets for 106 runs

 a large number of spectators at The Oval Grounds had come to see Tendulkar's centuries scoring centuries, but the veteran batsman could not complete his 100th international century despite his life on personal scores of 70 and 85 runs
 donon maukon par badakismat gendbaaj swaan hi rahe
 Earlier in the morning, the Indian batsmen were named in the morning session, who kept the England bowlers out of wickets for 30 overs while scoring 87 runs during this period, but England made a strong comeback in the second session, spending 67 runs in 26 overs and the remaining seven of the visiting team

 On the other hand, Mishra also showed his attitude and hit two on Graeme Swann while Stuart Broad hit a four

 Akhilesh Yadav's removal of Mulayam Singh Yadav as party president will be counted among the most dramatic stories in Indian politics
 akhilesh ne apane pita ke raajnneetik vaaris bane or unhen hi kinare kar aage nikal gaye
 Akhilesh's stance is clear that this time he is not ready to compromise
 chunaav ayog ne upi samet paanch rajyon main chunaav kii ghoshnaa kar chukaa he
 Akhilesh was well aware that elections would be announced by January and the election would bring a code of conduct, after which he would neither be able to distribute laptops nor cut metro lace
 ye saare kaam akhilesh ne disambar main hi kar liye the
 Alam was that on 20 December alone, he laid the foundation stone and inaugurated 51 projects worth 51 thousand crores in 5 hours
 sapa sarkaar kii ye tamaam yojanaonagaamee chunaav main voter ko lubhanemen ahm bhoomika nibhaa sakati hai lekin lekin aankade kuch or hi bayaan karte najar aate hai
 On the day of the announcement of the election, Akhilesh gave a full-page advertisement in almost all the hindi-english newspapers and stated his achievements
 jisamen likhaa gaya likhaa ki iraadaa sachcha ho to sab ho saktaa he
 But if you analyze the advertisements of Akhilesh, then the truth seems to be something else
 samaajawaadee yuva rojgaar yojana ke bare main sarkaar ne vigyaapan ke jariye daawa kiya he ki 2012 se 2016 ke bich unhone 1,35,228 logon ko is yojana kaa laabh diya
 For this, he had a budget of 180 lakh rupees
 ab ek baar main darshak ko lag saktaa he kiakhilesh sarkaaraki vajah se 180 lakh kaa bajet janata kii bhalaai main laga or kareeb dedh lakh logon ko iskaa phayda hoga
 But if we do a little math, then the address goes a little further
 upi ke 1,35,228 logon main jab 180 lakh rupye bantenge, to har ek ke hisse main sirf 133
 10 rupees is only rupee
 upar se turra ye ki 2007-12 ke bich sirf 33 lakh rupye baante gaye the
 Out of 51,652 people
 inhone to teen guna logon ko chah guna paisa de diya
 Figures from 2007 to 2012 show that under this scheme only 63 beneficiaries
 88 rupye mili
 Surely statistics are better
 lekin, aise to 10 rupye ke bajaay 20 rupye muaavja dene vaali sarkaar bhi ye kah sakati he ki usne muaavja 100 fisadi badha diya
 But what will be good for the people
 uttar pradesh main loksabhaa chunaav ke baad se yahi ho rahaa he
 People are being misled in the name of schemes
 akhilesh jage hai, lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar jhelane ke baad
 That election is nothing short of a nightmare for him, which he would never like to remember
 phir bhi upi ke naseeb main koi sudhaar nahin hua tha
 Kairana, Muzaffarnagar riots, Bulandshahar highway gangrape, Akhlaq massacre are all seen by UP during Akhilesh's tenure
 sarkaar ko vastu evam seva kar yani jiesti kii dedline april 2017 he or ise lagu karne ke liye sarkaar ko kaaphi mashkkat kerani hogi
 The GST, which is being called India's biggest tax reform, was passed by the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday
 ise satta main aane ke baad se pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sabase badi jeet bataaya ja rahaa he
 Now in the Lok Sabha it has become easier to pass because the government is in majority there
 uske baad jiesti ko desh ke 29 rajyon main se kam se kam 15 rajyon se paarit hona aavashyak he
 The government wants this work to be completed within the next 30 days
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke vaise to pradhanmantri narendra modi se madhur sambandh nahin hai, lekin unhone kaha ki ve apni taraf se jo kar sakate hai, jiesti ke liye vah karne ko taiyaar hai
 The monsoon session of the Bihar Legislative Assembly ended on Thursday but Nitish Kumar telephoned Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to propose that he can also call a special session of the House to pass the GST
 mukhyamantri ne pehle kaha tha ki jiesti lagu hone se bihar ke rajasav main har saal kareeb 8000 karod rupee kaa ijapha hoga
 The Parliament and then the states which are in the process of passing it is a constitutional amendment which will give new tax power to the government
 baad main jiesti kii nai dar or uske paimaane ko lekar nayaa kanoon alag se rivyuu ke liye bheja jayega
 State governments are broadly supporting GST as it would increase their share of central taxes and make intra-state trade more accessible
 rajyon ke pratinidhi jiesti kii dar tay karne ke liye vitt mantri ke saath sahyog karenge
 Though the Chief Economic Advisor to the government has suggested a rate of 18 per cent, sources in the finance ministry say the rate may be higher
 mukhya vipakshi dal congress ne kaha he ki agar jiesti kii dar 18 fisadi se adhik hoti he to vah iskaa virodh karegi
 The comments chunki jiesti khapat par lagu hota he, isliye chizon kaa utpaadan karne vaale rajyon ko hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai 5 saal tak centre dwaara kiye jane kaa bharosa diya gaya he
 Experts are saying that setting up a new IT system, training thousands of tax personnel and informing companies about the changes will prove to be the biggest challenge in the way of timely implementation of GST
 bharat ke sabase bade tex sudhaar kahe ja rahe jiesti ko buudhvaar ko rajyasabha ne paas kar diya
 It is being described as the biggest victory of Prime Minister Narendra Modi since coming to power
 ab loksabhaa main iske paas hone kaa rasta aasaan ho gaya he kyonki sarkaar vahaan bahumat main he
 After that GST is required to be passed by at least 15 of the 29 states in the country
 sarkaar chaahati he ki yah kaam agle 30 dinon ke bheetar puraa ho jaae
 Although Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar does not have a cordial relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said that he is willing to do what he can for his side for GST
 bihar vidhansabha kaa monsoon satr guuruuvaar ko samaapt ho chukaa he lekin nitish kumaar ne vitt mantri arun jetali ko phone kar prastaav diya ki jiesti ko paas karne ke liye vah sadan kaa vishesh satr bhi bula sakate hai
 The Chief Minister had earlier said that with the implementation of GST, Bihar's revenue will increase by about Rs 8000 crore every year
 sansad or uske baad rajya jise paarit karne kii prakriya main hai vah ek samvidhan sanshodhan he jo sarkaar ko nai kar shakti pradaan karegaa
 Later a new law regarding the new rate and scale of GST will be sent for a separate review
 rajya sarkarein vyapak rup se jiesti kaa samarthan kar rahi hai kyonki isse kendriya karon ke unke hisse main badhotaree hogi or atarraji vyapaar or sugam ho jayega
 Representatives of the states will cooperate with the Finance Minister to fix the rate of GST
 haalanki sarkaar ke mukhya aarthik salaahkaar ne 18 fisadi kii dar kaa suzav diya he lekin vitt mantralay ke sutron kaa kahana he isaki dar isse zyada ho sakati he
 The main opposition Congress has said that if the GST rate is more than 18 percent then it will oppose it
 tippaniyan Since GST is applicable to consumption, the states producing the things have been assured to recover the loss due to the Center by 5 years

 But the start of this solar alliance has been faded as it has only one big country apart from India and Brazil and that is France which was India's partner in laying the foundation of this solar alliance last year
 solar alliance ke tahat saura urja kii acchhee sambhaavna vaale kareeb 120 deshon ke ek saajha sanghathan banane kii baat he
 These countries lie completely or partially between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer, due to which there is a good possibility of solar energy
 solar alliance kaa makasad saura urja ko badhaava dena or uske zariye solar energy kii maang badhaakar isaki keemat ko kam karnaa he
 Given the threat of climate change and the rising temperature of the earth, this alliance can be effective because it is a revolutionary idea towards solar energy, but the biggest concern about this alliance is money and technology
 kuch jaankaar kehete hai ki solar alliance ke liye abhi na to koi fund taiyaar hua he or na hi ye spasht he ki solar alliance apane makasad ko kaise hasil karegaa
 The comments china or germany jaise bade desh abhi iskaa hissaa nahin bane hai or america ne to isamen shaamil hone se inkaar kar diya he jiske baad is alliance ke bhavishya ko lekar bhi kai shankaaen hai
 According to experts, until the big developing countries do not become part of it, then there will be a problem of money and finance, because many poor countries are only waiting for help in this alliance

 The purpose of Solar Alliance is to promote solar energy and through this, increase the demand for solar energy and reduce its price
 jalwaayu parivartan ke khatre or dharti ke badhate taapmaana ko dekhte hue yah alliance kargar ho saktaa he kyonki ye saura urja kii disha main krantikari vichaar he lekin is alliance ko lekar sabase badi phikr paise or technology kii he
 Some experts say that no fund has been prepared for the Solar Alliance, nor is it clear how the Solar Alliance will achieve its objective
 tippaniyan Big countries like China and Germany are not yet part of it and the US has refused to join it, after which there are many doubts about the future of this alliance

 nai sarkaar kaa mantrimandal bedam he
 Hopefully, the government will not disappoint further
 '' modi sarkaar ke shapath grahan ke agle hi din antarrashtriya nivesh form credit suis kii yah tippanee bahuton ko akhar gai thi
 The conclusion was factual but the comment seemed to be somewhat hasty
 alabatta beete saptaah ek bade videshi niveshak ne do-took andaaj main mujhase poocha ki modi sarkaar kaa plan bi kya he? to mujhe achraj nahin hua kyonki siyaasi se lekar korporate galiyaaron tak yah prashn kulbulane laga he ki kya narendra modi ke liye apni sarkaar kii badi surgery karne kaa vakt aa gaya he
 This question is not only motivated by the weak performance of the government
 sushamaa-vasundhara ke lalit prem, smriti irani kii murdhanyata ke vivaad or sarkaar va party par modi-shah ke ikbaal ko lekar asamanjas kii gunj bhi is sawaal main suni ja sakati he
 By the time one year of the Modi government was completed, the truth was almost digested that the results were weak in the face of expectations and intentions
 lekin yah ashanka kisi ko nahin thi ki nai sarkaar koi thos badlaav mahasoos karaae bina apane shishav main hi un vivaadon main ulajh jaaegi jo na keval gavarnence ke utsaah nigal sakate hai, balki jinke chalate sarkaar or bijepi main narendra modi va amit shah kaa dabadabaa bhi daanv par lag jayega
 There have been two faces of the Modi government in the last one year
 ek cheharaa bhavy or shandaar aayojanon va prabhavi samvaad kii ranneetiyon kaa he
 But the opposite is the other face of a solid status quo in governance that could not melt
 yah tehraav khud pradhanmantri ko bhi baichaiyn kar rahaa he
 This uneasiness of the government can be tied into facts
 masalan, naukarshahi main pherbadal ko lijie
 In the last 12 months, there have been three major changes in the bureaucracy of the Center
 yah uthapatak, sarkaar chalaane main asamanjas kii nazeer he
 The Modi government wants to make bureaucracy stable and independent, while the rigorous reshuffle has done the opposite
 thik isi tarah kriyanvayan kii chunautiyon ke chalate, tamaam badi ghoshnaaon ke lakshya va praavdhaan badal die gaye hai
 If the gritty is added to the big electoral promises like One Rank One Pension, Food inflation, Transparency at higher positions, then it is not difficult to feel that the slope is in front and the government will have to make bold changes in the face and nature of the return
 Four years are yet to pass
 narendra modi ab apni sarkaar kii surgery kiye bina aage nahin bad sakate
 By the first reorganization of the Cabinet, it was clear that due to lack of experience and professional people, Team Modi is very poor in expectations
 pichley ek saal kaa report card is baat kii taakid karata he ki zyaadaatar mantri koi asar nahin chhod sake hai
 Whether it is the inability of the ministers or not getting the rights, but Modi's cabinet has failed to bring his intentions to the ground
 mahatvapurn sansthaaon main khaali sheersh pad bataate hai ki ek saal baad bhi sarkaar kaa aakaar puraa nahin ho sakaa he
 If Modi does not reduce the burden of stagnation in his cabinet in the next three months, then the benefits of policy emptiness and weak governance are awaiting him
 modi bhale hi salaah na sunne ke liye jane jate hon lekin ab unhen arthvyavastha, videsh niti se lekar apane bhaashanon tak ke liye think tanks or salaahkaaron kii jarurat he jo sarkaar ko nitiyon, kaaryakramon or kanoonon kii nai sujh de saken
 Due to the duplication of UPA schemes in the new packaging, big missions are not able to give even small results and failures are increasing
 modi sarkaar ko kriyanvayan ke dhaanche main bhi sooyeeboojh bhare badlaavon kii jarurat he jiske liye use peshewaron kii samaj par bharosa karnaa hoga jaisaa ki duniya ke anya deshon main hota he
 Narendra Modi cannot afford to compromise with the high standards of morality and transparency in his government and party, because the mandate given to his government is different
 vasundhara, sushamaa, smriti, pankaja ke maamle bijepi se zyada modi kii raajnneeti ke liye nirnaayak hai
 These cases have hurt Modi double
 ek to unki saaf-suthri sarkaar ab daagi ho gai he
 Secondly, adamant leaders are challenging modi-shah's control over not stepping down
 gavarnence or paardarshita ke maamle main modi kii chunautiyaan manmohan se zyada badi hai
 In the era of Manmohan, the charges of corruption and policy nullity could be put on the compulsions of the coalition
 yahi vajah thi ki upie sarkaar ke kalank kaa bada hissaa congress party ke khate main gaya
 However, in the BJP, both the government and the party are contained in Modi and the leaders of his own party are tainted
 isliye sabhi tohamatein sirf modi ke khate main darj hongi
 The trouble is that many of the myths of the new government are suddenly breaking together
 mantriyon or mukhyamantriyon par modi kii sakht pakad kii dantakthaon ke vipareet varisht mantri va mukhyamantri daagi hote dikh rahe hai, jabaki jan samvaad kii jabardast ranneetiyon ke baavjood thos nateezon kii anupasthiti logon ko niraash kar rahi he
 Within a year, the government has started to look like a film set which has grandeur outside, but behind the upa-like opacity and policy emptiness
 modi jis tareeke se bijepi kii rashtriya raajnneeti main ubhare or chunaav jite hai, usamen unki rajnatik safalataa kaa sara daaromadar unki gavarnence kii kamyaabi par he
 If the government is unsuccessful or tainted, the water of their Iqbal will not prove to be sustainable on the party
 sarkaar ko lekar bechaini badaae lagi he lekin bharosa abhi kaayam he
 Narendra Modi will have to do something bluntly, there is no middle path for him
 sarkaar va party main saahsee badlaavon main ab agar deree hui to modi ko agle chaar saal tak ek aisi rakshaatmak sarkaar chalaane par majaboor hona hoga jo vipaksh ke hamalon ke saamne apane tevar ganvaati chali jaaegi
 Of course, Narendra Modi would never want to lead a weak and inconsequential government

 Recently, the sweepers under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation went on strike due to non-payment of their allowances, due to which the people had to suffer

 Why is Kejriwal's hydro-political analyst and former AAP leader Ashutosh agreed that the Kejriwal government has gained public support by improving the conditions in areas like facilities, health and education
 ashutosh ne kaha, 'AAP ke paksh main chaar baaten gai hai- bijli, pani, shiksha or swasthya
 In these four sectors, i think the Aam Aadmi Party government has done an extraordinary job
 bijli or pani ne garibi rekha se neeche rahane vaale bade varg ko nishchit rup se santusht kiya he
 It has also benefited people from Bihar and other parts
 'udhar,chunaav vishleshak yogendra yadavathodi alag raay rakhte hai
 According to him, the AAP government has been successful at a limited level, but it does not face any real opposition challenge
 yadav ne kaha, ‘main kahuunga ki ye simit or thodi bahut kamyaabi hi he
 In a very sense, the fact is that there is no opposition

 Is not an agenda
 
 
 congress phir vaapasi karti prathit ho rahi thi, lekin ye apni andruni chalbaasiyon main ulajhakar rah gai lagati he
 In such a situation, there is no real challenge from the opposition in the state

 They should feel safe from constitutional provisions

 patil ne ab kaha he ki isse wo manaa nahin kar rahe bayaan unheen kaa he lekin jis sandarbh main unhone kaha tha, use vaise hi pesh nahin kiya gaya
 That is, Patil wanted to say that his statement has been distorted
 patil ne somvaar ko kaha, 'koi to musalmaan he jo pakistan jindabad ke naare lagaataa he
 There is a Muslim who breaks firecrackers when Pakistan wins in a cricket match
 koi to he jo pakistan kaa jhanda haath main lekar ghumta he

 patil ne apni baat ko or spasht karte hue kaha, 'sirf road or siver hi vikaas nahin hota, uske saath dharm or samskruti kii raksha karne kii jimmedaari bhi netaaon kii he
 There can be no Hindu vs Muslim (election) but if any Muslim acts against Hindustan then it is our duty to stop it
 'reports ke mutabik pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ravivaar ko hi namo ap parabijepi ke saansadon or vidhayakonko sambodhit karte hue aagaah kiya tha ki ve bolne main sanyam baraten or party main jin par bolne kii jimmedaari he, yani pravaktaaon ko hi bolne kaa kaam karne den
 The Prime Minister also said that do not hold the media responsible for their mistakes, because these mistakes only spice up the media
 patil ne ‘ajtak’ se kaha ki karnataka vidhansabha chunaav vikaas ke saath-saath dharm or samskruti kii raksha ke mudde par hoga
 According to Patil, there will be issues like development, jobs in elections, but the issue of the country should be first
 desh rahegaa tabhi to vikaas hoga
 Patil said with full fervor, 'why are you ashamed to say Bharat Mata ki Jai and Vande Mataram, even if the accounts are here, they drink here
 jo hindu hoga, hindustani hoga, bharat maa se pyaar karegaa vah bharat maa kaa gungan karegaa
 According to Patil, the video that came out about his alleged statement was about a conversation with workers
 patil ne saath hi sawaal kiya ki unka ye bhi bayaan he ki hindustan main ram mandir bananaa chahie to usamen kya galat he, hindustan me ram mandir nahin banegaa to kahaan pakistan main banegaa
 Patil said, 'the matter is not to target any one community, that's why i said that the video was twisted and presented
 ’patil ne karnataka kemukhyamantri siddharmayaper lingayat samudaay ko baantne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 Patil said, the Lingayat society, which has been living with brother fodder for thousands of years, broke them
 agar lingayat kii maang alag pahchaan kii he to chunaav ke vakt hi congress sarkaar ko ye kyon yaad aayaa
 It has been 5 years since the Congress became the government in the state, why not remember before
 ’patil ne kaha ki karnataka kii janata sab jaanati he, 15 may tak rukiye janata bataa degi ki lingayat kiske saath hai
 According to Patil, there is a truth in Karnataka that Deve Gowda is considered the leader of Vokaliga
 jis kurbar samaaj kaa netaa siddharmaiya ko mana jaataa he usee tarah yediurppa ko lingayat samaaj kaa netaa mana jaataa he
 Patil also accused Siddaramaiah of having launched the Bhagya Bhagya scheme of discrimination
 patil ne kaha ki kya ye yojana sirf musalamaanon ke liye he, kisi or samaaj main, kisi or dharm ke logon main garib log nahin hote kya?patil ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tarif main jahaan koi kasar nahin chodi vahiin yah bhi kaha ki karnataka main kya chal rahaa he, use saamne laana wo apana ferj samajhate hai
 Regarding the advice of the Prime Minister, Patil said that his order is God's offering to us
 apane bayaan ko vivaadaaspad maanane se inkaar karte hue patil ne kaha, ‘ye to aap kah rahe hai, main to sachai bataa rahaa hum

 Defeating in Naded: Expressing happiness over the recent bjp's defeat in Nanded Municipal Corporation elections, Raut said that the reason for the defeat of Nanded is the rulership of the BJP government as well as their failed economic policies which were imposed on the people
 raut ye kehane se bhi nahin chuke ki kai baar aisa hua he kinanded chunaavse hi anek satta parivartan kii shuruyaat hui he
 That is why Congress state president Ashok Chavan has said that the bjp's countdown has started, it is right

 Describing the BJP as a 'saffron Congress', facing the electoral defeat and infighting, its former leader KN Govindacharya today said that like the Jana Sangh, a new political alternative should be considered by ending it
 jansangh kii tarah bhaajapa ko samaapt kar diya jaegovindacharya ne yahaan kaha ki itihaas main kai aise maukey aae hai jab puraane upkaran or manch ke nayi chunautiyon kaa saamana karne main sakasham nahin hone par naye vikalp pesh kiye gaye hai
 One such example is that of the Jana Sangh, as an alternative to which the BJP was introduced
 unhone kaha ki main is sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kar saktaa ki jansangh kii tarah bhaajapa ko bhi samaapt kar diya jaae
 It can also be tried from within the BJP
 nikat bhavishya main aisi kisi sambhaavna ke saakaar hone ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha ki aage aage dekhie hota he kya
 Responding to questions about how the bjp's Senapati Bhajpa is fighting among themselves and its relationship with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the former BJP leader said that the Sangh has a relationship for more than 45 years and there is a widespread dialogue even today
 sangh ke netaaon se mahatvapurn vishyon par baatcheet hoti rahati he or unhen bhi bharosa he ki main apane vivek se chalane vaala vyakti hum
 Targeting Advani, Govindacharya said that Advani has said many times that ideology is irrelevant in the context of fulfilling the responsibility of governance
 unke netritv main party ke sipaahi to sangharsh ko taiyaar he lekin senapati aapas main lard rahe hai
 BJP ideology has gone astray Govindacharya said that the country is going through a serious situation and 11-11 players of the ruling and opposition are engaged in scoring goals against the people
 unhone kaha ki vipaksh kii jimmedaari hoti he ki vah janata se jude muddon ko sarkaar ke samaksh majbootee ke saath uthaae or jarurat pade to sarkaar ko janata kii ore dhyaan dene ke liye majaboor kare
 But the bjp's form as the opposition today has become that of the 'saffron Congress'
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa aaj nishchit taur par vichaardhaara se bhatki he
 i believe in 'giving pass', not in scoring goals, the party's ideology is made up of what elements and the criteria of discipline should be decided
 unhone kaha ki agar party main vichaardhaara ke khilaaf kaam hote hai or phir bhi kaha jaae ki vichaardhaara par kaayam hai to yah party or janata se dhokhadhadi he
 When asked about his return to the BJP, he said that i believe that there is a bigger country than a person and a country bigger than a party
 main naye raajnneetik vikalp ke paksh main puri tarah se patibaddh hum
 i believe in 'passing', not in scoring

 The case of the killing of Rakbar Khan by the alleged guards in Alwar, Rajasthan is now catching on
 sansad se lekar desh kii sabase badi adaalat main is maamle kii gunj he
 Now Congress President Rahul Gandhi has also questioned the irresponsible attitude of the police in this matter
 somvaar ko is maamle ke bare main twit karte hue rahul ne likhaa ki jab mauka-e-vaardaat se aspataal sirf 6 kimi
 It was 3 kilometers, so why did the police take 3 hours to take Rakbar there
 rahul ne sawaal uthaaya ki police vaale raste main chaay kaa anand le rahe the
 He said that this is Modi's cruel New India, where humanity has been replaced by hatred and people are being pressed and they are being left to die
 kya he police kii laaparvaahee kaa sach?exiaar or khabaron ke mutabik police ko kareeb 12
 Rakbar was reported at 40
 lekin police ne kareeb 4 baje rakabar ko aspataal pahunchaaya
 The biggest thing was the hospital was just 6 kilometers from the scene
 aise main police ko kareeb 3-4 ghante kaise lag gaye
 The doctor says that there was a delay in bringing Rakbar to the hospital and by the time he reached the hospital, he had lost his life
 aakhir rakabar ko police ne aspataal main pahunchane main deree kaise kii, 'ajtak' kii team ne jab uski padtaal kii to ek ke baad ek chaunkaane vaale khulaase saamne aae
 Negligence number-1 You will be surprised to know that the police reached to take tea sips before taking Rakbar to the hospital
 agar rakabar kii haalat agar gambhir thi to police ne gaadi rokkar raste main chaay kyon pi
 Negligence No
 2 is the allegation that the police bathed the sand in the mud first to prevent the vehicle from getting dirty
 laaparvaahee number-3bataaya ja rahaa he ki rakabar ko pahunchane se pehle kareeb ek baje gaayon ko gaushala pahunchaa diya gaya, jabaki rakabar ko police tahalaati rahi
 What is the Alwar case? Let me tell you that the state police have been facing serious charges in the case of Rakbar Khan's death in mob lynching in Alwar district of Rajasthan
 aarope he ki police ne rakabar ko aspataal pahunchane kii jagah baraamad gaayon ko pehle gaushala pahunchane ko tarjeeh di
 Not only this, the police themselves beat Rakbar as well
 isaki vajah se rakabar ko aspataal pahunchane main teen ghante kii deree hui or uski maut ho gai
 Alwar SP Rajendra Singh told Aaj Tak that the matter will be investigated
 media main ai khabaron main yah kaha gaya tha ki rakabar ko aspataal pahunchane main teen ghante lag gaye or police ne rakabar ko aspataal pahunchane kii jagah pehle gaayon ko gaushala tak pahunchane ko praathamikta di
 It is worth mentioning that a person named Rakbar Khan was beaten to death by some alleged cow guards in Lalvandi village of Ramgarh police station area
 kya hua tha 18 agast, 1945 ko? kya netaji subhaashachandr bose kaa vimaan formosa (ab taiwan) main durghatana kaa shikaar ho gaya tha or isamen netaji maare gaye the? yaa phir vah batch gaye the or srbija chale gaye the? yaa phir 'vimaan haadasa' mahaj ek 'aad' thi unhen surakshit nikal jane dene ke liye? ye kuch aise sawaal hai jo 70 saalon se bharatiyon kaa, khaskar bengaaliyon kaa, peechha kar rahe hai, unhen pareshaan kar rahe hai
 But, the secret is that it does not take the name of being unmasked
 netaji ke vaarison kaa ek dhada (jisamen unki beti anita phalf bhi shaamil hai) or subhaashachandr bose kii indian neshnal army (iene) ke kuch bujurg yoddha maanate hai ki vimaan haadase main netaji kii maut hui thi or unki asthiyaan tokyo ke rankoji mandir main surakshit rakhi hui hai
 However, Netaji's family, fans and researchers do not agree with this story of the incident
 or, aisa maanane waalon kii sankhya bahut adhik he
 Anita Faf came to Kolkata in 2013
 unhone kaha tha, 'yah netaji ke liye shandaar ghar vaapasi hoti
 Their bones were brought to India and they were flown here into the Ganges
 ' Saugata Roy, a descendant of Netaji and a professor at Harvard University, also believes that Netaji died in a plane crash
 vah is haadase main jinda batch gaye logon kii gavaahi kaa purajor hawala dete hai
 Investigation of Netaji's case Shahnawaz Khan Committee (1956), G
 di
 Khosla Committee (1970) and M
 ke
 Mukherjee Commission (2006)
 jaanch to hui, lekin nateeja nahin niklaa
 Shahnawaz Khan Committee and G
 di
 The Khosla Committee admitted that Netaji had died in the plane crash, but the Mukherjee Commission rejected that Netaji had died in an accident
 haalanki sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog kii report sweekaar nahin kii
 Anuj Dhar Mukherjee, an author and researcher in this case, agrees with the Commission's results
 dhar ne kaha, 'mukherjee ayog ko or mujhe bhi bheje gaye patr main taiwan ke adhikariyon ne yahi kaha he ki 18 agast, 1945 ko koi haadasa nahin hua tha
 ' unhone kaha, 'aisi kai gopneey filein hai, jo sabit kar dengi ki vimaan haadase kii baat japaniyon or netaji ne jaan boojhkar failaai thi taaki unhen soviet rus nikal jane kaa mauka mil sake
 ' lekin, netaji kii sahyogi rah chukin lakshmi sahagal isse sahamat nahin thim
 He said that the plane crash and Netaji's death in it is a fact
 iskaa record isliye nahin he, kyonki haarane se pehle japaniyon ne apane yuddh aparaadhon par pardaa daalane ke liye sabhi dastavej nasht kar die the
 Documents of Netaji's plane crash went to him
 ab netaji ke gharavaalon or unke chaahane waalon kii maang he ki centre or pashchim bengal sarkaar is maamle se judi sabhi filon ko saarvajanik kare
 It will be clear that Ichiro Okura, a Japanese soldier who died in the plane crash, was not Netaji
 tippaniyan Netaji's associate Colonel Habiburrahman told the Shahnawaz Committee that Netaji had died in the plane crash
 kehete hai ki aakhri vakt main karnal rahamaan, netaji ke saath the or haadase main batch gaye the
 But people disagreeing with the story of the incident say that Colonel Rahman did not speak the truth and he did so only on Netaji's suggestion
 netaji ke bade bhai sharat chandra bose ne karnal rahamaan se poochtacha kii thi
 Chandra Kumar, the grandson of Sharat Chandra Bose, quoted his father Amey Nath as saying, "sharat Chandra Bose had questioned Colonel Rahman for hours about the plane crash and then rejected him
 ' a section of Netaji's heirs (including his daughter Anita Faf) and some elderly warriors of the Indian National Army (INA) of Subhash Chandra Bose believe that Netaji died in a plane crash and their ashes are safe at the Renkoji Temple in Tokyo Is kept lekin, netaji ke parijan, prashansak, shodh karne vaale haadase kii is kahani se sahamat nahin hai
 And, the number of those who believe so is very large
 anita phalf 2013 main kolkata ai thim
 He had said, 'it would have been a fantastic homecoming for Netaji
 unki asthiyaan bharat laai jaatin or unhen yahaan ganga main pravaahit kiya jaataa
 ' netaji ke vanshaj or harvard vishvavidhyalay ke professor saugat roy bhi yahi maanate hai ki netaji kii maut vimaan haadase main hui thi
 He strongly cites the testimony of those who survived in this accident
 netaji ke maamle kii jaanch shahanvaj khan samiti (1956), ji
 D
 khosla samiti (1970) or em
 K
 mukherjee ayog (2006) ne kii
 Investigation was done, but no result was found
 shahanvaj khan samiti or ji
 D
 khosla samiti ne mana ki vimaan haadase main netaji kii maut hui thi, lekin mukherjee ayog ne is baat ko khaarij kar diya ki netaji kii maut kisi haadase main ho chuki he
 However, the government did not accept the Mukherjee Commission report
 is maamle main shodh karne vaale or lekhak anuj dhar mukherjee ayog ke nateezon se sahamat hai
 Dhar said, "in the letter sent to the Mukherjee Commission and also to me, the Taiwan authorities have said that there was no accident on August 18, 1945
 ' He said, 'there are many such confidential files, which will prove that the incident of the plane was deliberately spread by the Japanese and Netaji so that they could get a chance to leave Soviet Russia
 ' However, Lakshmi Sehgal, who was Netaji's associate, did not agree
 unka kahana tha ki vimaan haadasa or usamen netaji kii maut ek sachai he
 The record is not because the Japanese destroyed all documents to cover up their war crimes before they were defeated
 netaji ke vimaan haadase ke dastavej isi kii bhent chadh gaye
 Now there is a demand from Netaji's family members and their fans that the Central and West Bengal governments should make all the files related to this matter public
 isse saaf ho jayega ki vimaan haadase main marane vaala ek japani sainik ichiro okura tha, na ki netaji
 The comments netaji ke sahyogi karnal habiburrahaman ne shahanvaj samiti se kaha tha ki netaji kii maut vimaan haadase main hui thi
 It is said that Colonel Rahman was with Netaji at the last moment and survived the accident
 lekin haadase kii kahani se asahmat logon kaa kahana he ki karnal rahamaan ne sach nahin bolaa or unhone aisa netaji ke kehane par hi kiya
 Colonel Rahman was interrogated by Netaji's elder brother Sharat Chandra Bose
 sharat chandra bose ke pote chandra kumaar ne apane pita ameey nath ke hawaale se bataaya, 'sharat chandra bose ne ghanton karnal rahamaan se vimaan haadase ke bare main poochtacha kii thi or phir unki baat ko khaarij kar diya tha
 ' lekin, netaji ke parijan, prashansak, shodh karne vaale haadase kii is kahani se sahamat nahin hai
 And, the number of those who believe so is very large
 anita phalf 2013 main kolkata ai thim
 He had said, 'it would have been a fantastic homecoming for Netaji

 Rajasthan 10th Result 2019 assam, pashchim bengal, kerala, tamilnadu or puducheri main hue vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey guuruuvaar ko saamne aa gaye
 In these states, the Congress has suffered badly, everywhere except Puducherry
 assam or kerala main vah satta se baahar ho gai he to tamilnadu or pashchim bengal main uski haalat pehle se bhi badtar ho gai
 4 important reasons for such a big defeat of Congress - 1
 kerala or assam main anti inakambencykeral kii 140 siton main gathbandhan ke baavjood dopaher baad tak rujhaan main congress 23 siton par hi aage dikhi
 At the same time, its lead was recorded in 23 of the 126 seats of Assam
 donon hi rajyon main usne sarkaar kho diya
 In Kerala, the Congress coalition took away the government from the left parties
 oman chandi ke kaaryastylee ke khilaaf vipakshiyon ne lagaataar andolan jari rakhaa
 At the same time, Tarun Gogoi, who was the Chief Minister of Assam for 15 years, also surrounded the question of development works
 donon jagahon par sarkaar virdohi maahaul ne unhen satta se baahar karne main bhoomika nibhaai
 2
 vam dalon se ankhmichauni kii vajah se bharose kaa sankatcongress ko gathbandhan ke baavjood keralavamadalonke khilaaf or pashchim bengal main vam morche ke saath chunaav ladanaa bhi baari pad gaya
 This attitude of the Congress in the cadre-based Left parties could not inspire confidence
 congress or communiston ke bich yah lav and het relationships rang nahin laa paaya
 This is the reason that the Congress went to the government in Kerala and despite the alliance in 294 seats of West Bengal, it continued to make gains around 40 seats
 3
 In the coordination of central and local leadership, when the assembly elections were going on in the states, the central leadership of the Congress was involved in other reasons
 taiyaari ke vakt kendriya netritv neshnal herald cese, chunaav ke dauraan agasta westland choper deal scam or iske pehle jeenyu main deshvirohi narebaaji or hyderabad central uniwarsity main rohit vemula kii khudakushi ke masale par raajnneeti karne main samay laga rahaa tha
 On the other hand, the state leadership of the Congress was spending time during campaigning to explain these allegations too
 rahul gandhi ke lagaataar daure main bhi sthaneey mudde kii jagah centre sarkaar par hamalaa or khud kii safai dena hi haaavee rahaa
 4
 modi-shah kii ranneeti kaa jawaab nahin de paae sonia-rahulrajyon main kshetreey dalon se gathbandhan kaa maamla ho yaa prachaar kii aakraamak style congress alaakaman sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke paas bijepi kemodi-shah kii ranneetiyonka jawaab nahin tha
 The Congress remained mostly silent on the issues raised by the BJP in Assam
 vahiin anya rajyon main majboot kshatrapon ke saamne bhi modi or bijepi ko nishaanaa banane kii vajah se bhi congress uljhi rahi
 Karunanidhi's party, along with the DMK, in a total of 232 seats in Tamil Nadu, could not even lead in the tens seat
 chaar rajyon main bhale hi alag-alag dal jeeten ho par raajnneetik vichaaron main sabhi gaiyrcongressi hai
 It can also be seen as an anti-congress wave
 iske ranneetikaar bhi piem narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii jodi hi maani jaati he
 Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office v Narayanasamy said that the government would not take Team Anna's allegations against Union Ministers seriously
 narayansami ne dilli se yahaan aane ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki main unke bare main nijee taur par koi tippanee nahin karnaa chahta lekin ham unhen gambhirtha se nahin lete
 Team Anna had last month brought charges against Pranab Mukherjee, the UPA candidate for the post of Prime Minister, Finance Minister and President and 13 other ministers and demanded the formation of a special investigation team
 is maang ko sarkaar ne khaarij kar diya
 Narayanasamy said that the Prime Minister has asked all parties to cooperate on Mukherjee's candidature
 unhone ummid jataayi ki mukherjee nirvirodh nirvaachit honge
 Earlier, Shipping Minister GK Vasan had said that the government does not attach much importance to such allegations
 ham log aadharahin aaropon ko adhik mahatv nahin dete
 Team Anna member Arvind Kejriwal said in Jodhpur that Mukherjee was a candidate for the top constitutional post and that the person sitting on the post should be immaculate
 aise vakt main majboot samarthan dene ke liye, jab lagbhag 15 vipakshi dal notebandi ke mudde par sarkaar ke virodh main ekajute ho gai hai, bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne nitish kumaar ko saarvajanik rup se dhanyavad bhi diya
 Such amicable dealings between the two parties have also led to misunderstandings, and have grown so much that Nitish Kumar had to clarify by addressing his ally Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) mlas in the state government that the BJP would again have There is no possibility of meeting
 tippaniyan On Thursday, Nitish Kumar's party Janata Dal United (JDU) also warned Prime Minister Narendra Modi that there is also an 'expiry date' of support given on the issue of demonetisation
 party ke varisht netaa pawan verma ne kaha tha ki ab ham janata ko ho rahi pareshaaniyon ko bhi dekh rahe hai, or 30 disambar ke baad notebandi kaa prabhaav dekhakar samarthan kii samiksha karenge
 
 
 He had said, "we will see if the goal that was taken in front of it, did it work for it
" 
 
 ?" So, after the Prime Minister's remarks on Friday, it does not seem that the Chief Minister of Bihar needs to reconsider his stand
 
 
 guuruuvaar ko hi nitish kumaar kii party janata dal united (jediu) ne bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chetaya tha ki notebandi ke mudde par die gaye samarthan kii 'expyri date' bhi he
 Senior party leader Pawan Verma had said that now we are also seeing the problems being faced by the public, and will review the support after December 30, seeing the impact of demonetisation
 
 
 unhone kaha tha, "ham dekhenge ki jis lakshya ko saamne rakhkar yah kadam uthaaya gaya tha, kya yah uske kaam aayaa
 
 
 ? " so, shuukravaar ko pradhanmantri kii tippanee ke baad philhal yah nahin lag rahaa he ki bihar ke mukhyamantri ko apane rukh ke bare main punarvichaar karne kii koi zarurat he
 
 
 So, after the Prime Minister's remarks on Friday, it does not seem that the Chief Minister of Bihar needs to reconsider his stand

 credit card se shopping suvidhajanak he or cash haath main na hone par bhi jarurat kaa saamaan aasaani se liya ja saktaa he
 But if you do not use it wisely, you can get into a lot of trouble
 festive sijan main to credit card or bhi mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 By the way, due to all the good offers, during this time, we feel more like shopping
 haalanki yah bhi sach he ki credit card se kharidari ke dauraan thodaa laalach bad jaataa he or tab khud par control karnaa mushkil hota he
 In this case, it is important to show some understanding
 aisa na ho ki aap ek hi baar main credit card kii sari limit khatm kar den or phir baad main instollment dene par aapako pareshaani ho yaa jaruri kharche tak rokane kii naubat aa jaae
 Credit card is a good thing
 to jaanate hai aise 5 tips, jo is sijan main acchhee kharidari ke saath hi credit card ko samajhadaari se istemaal karne kaa tarika bhi bataaenge -1) credit card se shopping karte samay har baar aap riward points kamaate hai
 Often you get 1 point on a purchase of 100-250
 haalanki yah alag-alag card or bank par depend karata hai
 It is prudent to keep updated with the points you have collected and use them while making shopping payments
 is tarah aapako khaasi bachat mil sakati he
 2) After purchasing with credit card, put all the payment details and installation reminders in your mobile, so that you remember that you have to clear it before due date so that later there will not be much interest burden
 koshish karen ki jab tak aap pehle vaali pement na kar den, tab tak or shopping na karen
 3) Try to avoid wastage
 kabhi bhi banpar ophers yaa cell ko dekhakar yah na sochen ki sara phayda abhi hi uthaa len
 Always keep in mind that companies and brands often come with some or the other offer
 aise main laalach main na pade
 Otherwise, it may have more burden on your pocket, including interest
 4) bajet se thodaa kam hi kharch karne kaa target banaaen
 If the limit of your credit card is 1 lakh, then try to settle your shopping within 80 thousand
 aisa karne se jarurat ke samay aap is bachaae huecredit kaa istemaal kar paaenge
 5) Make a habit of checking your credit card statement carefully every month
 ek acha tarika yah bhi he ki aap credit card ke jariye kharide gaye saamaan kaa bill hameshaa pement clear hone tak sambhaal kar rakhen
 With this, you will be able to easily verify the bill with the statement that there is no extra charge or there is some other disturbance
 iske alaava sibar security bhi ek bada mudda he

 Anticipating a breach of peace, Anna Hazare's detention was compared by Home Minister p Chidambaram's arrest of BJP leader LK Advani in Bihar in October 1990 when Lalu Prasad was the chief minister
 loksabhaa main hajaare prakaran par buudhvaar ko hui charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue chidambaram ne anna kii giraftaar ko sahi bataate hue kaha ki kisi ko keval kisi niyam kaa ulanghan karne par hi nahin, balki niyamon kaa ulanghan hone kii ashanka ke chalate bhi giraftaar kiya ja saktaa he
 He accepted the contention of Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj that Section 144 was not imposed where Anna was arrested
 unhone kaha, lekin unhen is ashanka main police ne hiraasat main liya ki kahin vah jepi maidan main jaakar aisa karne kaa prayaas nahin karen, jisase shanti-vyavastha bhang hone kaa khatra paidaa ho
 Pointing towards Advani in the House, he said that it was just like this when LK Prasad's Ram Rath Yatra was stopped by the then Chief Minister of Bihar Lalu Prasad in Samastipur itself and was apprehended for fear of disturbing the peace
 haalanki adwani ne kisi niyam kaa ulanghan nahin kiya tha
 On this, Lalu, present in the House, smiled and said, RK Singh, who is your Home Secretary today, arrested Advani

 His different characters in all his films like Secret Superstar, Dangal and Thugs of Hindostan etc
 are proof that Aamir is very serious about his character
 wo har film main apane luk ke liye kadi mehnat karte hai
 To keep her look more natural, Aamir does not use any hair extensions

 ravivaar ko sarv jaat khap panchayat kii baithak hone vaali he
 In this meeting of Khap Panchayat, the decision to remove the reservation received by Jats will be discussed
 khap panchayat is baithak main ye tay karegi ki supreme court main jaaton ko rigerveshan ko lekar rivyuu cameti daalaa jaae
 In this meeting, a decision will be taken to protest against the removal of the reservation
 gauratlab he ki jat ko samudaay ko pichhadaa maane jane ke centre ke mat par asahmati jataate hue supreme court ne tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh dwaara 4 march, 2014 ko jari us adhisuchana ko radd kar diya, jisamen nau rajyon main anya pichhadaa varg (obisi) ke tahat jaaton ko bhi aarakshan dene kii ghoshnaa kii gai thi
 a bench of Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman said, "we cannot agree with the central government's view that the Jat community in the nine states belongs to the backward class, hence the Central Government's Other Backward Castes (OBC) list They should be included
 'aapako bataa den ki upie sarkaar ne shiksha or sarkari naukariyon main jaaton ko laabh dene ke liye unhen obisi ke tahat aarakshan dene kaa praavdhaan kiya tha
 The then UPA government issued this notification ignoring the recommendation of the National Backward Classes Commission (NCBC) in this matter
 bijepi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar ne bhi haalanki purvavarti sarkaar ke faisle kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's style of good governance is now coming to the fore
 piem modi ke nirdesh par unke cabinet sachiv ajit seth ne sarkari vibhaagon se kaha he ki wo nirnay lene main or adhik chust bane
 For this, the first is to reduce the passing desk of a file to four
 saath hi yah bhi kaha gaya he ki aise kisi bhi maamle kii file ko pradhanmantri karyaalay yaa mantrimandal sachivalay ke paas pahunchaa di jaae jisko lekar koi sanshay ho
 The cabinet secretary has issued a letter instructing all ministries to reduce the size of the application form
 isamen kaha gaya he ki aavedan patr ko yathasambhav ek pej tak kar diya jaae
 The Cabinet Secretary will hold a meeting regarding the action plan of the ministries in this regard on Monday
 cabinet secretary ajit seth dwaara jari kiya gaya yah nirdesh pradhanmantri narendra modi kii us meeting ke baad aayaa jisamen sabhi mantralayon ko sarkari kaamkaaj kii gunvattta main sudhaar or logon ke liye sarkari kaamon ko aasaan banane par focus karne ko kaha gaya tha
 Eliminate unnecessary outdated laws At this meeting, all ministries have been made aware that the main focus is on improving work culture
 sabhi mantralayon ko aise kam se kam 10 niyamon, prakriyaaon or puraane kanoonon kii pahchaan kar khatm karne ko kaha gaya he jo ab anaavashyak hai or jise hataane par prakriya main kisi bhi prakaar kaa koi nuksaan na ho
 The bottom line is that in any case, files will not rotate more than four layers
 philhal ek file section officer se shuru hote hue up sachiv yaa nideshak ke paas jaati he phir joint secretary ke paas se hote hue yah secretary ke saamne rakhi jaati he or ant main yah mantri ke mej tak pahunchati he
 In many cases, the files keep circulating for weeks in the service ministries ie Law, Personnel, Finance and Planning Commission
 haalanki yah circular is baat par kuch nahin kahata ki ek file ke niptaare main kitna vakt laganaa chahie (pehle iske liye teen dinon kaa samay nirdhaarit tha)
 It is necessary to keep a record of the files
 The cabinet secretary also said that the files and papers should be removed according to the rules, save their records, including digitization
 saath hi yah nirdesh bhi diya gaya he ki yah puraa kaam teen se chaar hafte main hi khatm hona chahie
 Seth also asked the Heads of Departments and Secretaries to pay attention to the process of timely disposal of public grievances
 isamen yah bhi kaha gaya he ki puraa department ek unit kii tarah kaam kare or is puri prakriya ke dauraan jaankaree de or iskaa moolyavardhan kare
 All the departments have also been asked to analyze the goals and status of UPA-2 and make its information a part of the presentation to the Prime Minister
