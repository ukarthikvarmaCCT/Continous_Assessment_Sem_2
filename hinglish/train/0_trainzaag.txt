 lagata he, rajasthan main sattadhari bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii jameen khisakati ja rahi he
 Avinash Rai Khanna, in-charge of the state and party vice-president, met Ashok Jain, who retired from the post of former chief secretary of the state on December 31, while initiating a liaison campaign on June 1
 khanna ne unhen sarkaar kii nitiyon tathaa yojanaon se avgat karaayaa! rajya main sattashin hone ke chaar saal baad bhi bhaajapa is saal vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye koi kargar ranneeti banane ke liye jujh rahi he
 There is no agreement between Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and BJP President Amit Shah to remove state unit chief Ashok Parnami
 farvari main hue upachunaav main haar ke baad april se hi unhen hatane ke liye kah diya gaya tha
 But Raje has opposed the names of both Gajendra Singh Shekhawat (rajput) and Arjun Meghwal (dalit) in his place
 unka kahana he ki aisa karne se virdohi jatiyaan naaraaz ho sakati hai
 According to insiders, Raje does not really want someone from Delhi to be appointed as the state unit president as she wants to maintain complete control over ticket distribution for the assembly elections
 is gatirodh ne party alaakaman or raaje ke bich matbhedon ko ujagar kar diya he
 But Jat, OBC and some forward castes are happy with this
 bhaajapa ko rajasthan main janata kii ore se satta-virdohi rujhaan kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 One reason for this is the failure to make public aware of the achievements of the state and the center
 vahiin jal sansadhano ke liye centre kii ore se koi vishesh package dene se inkaar karnaa bhi ek vajah he, jabaki raaje isaki maang karti aa rahi hai
 Khanna and the state BJP unit are trying their best to turn public mood before Prime Minister Narendra Modi goes into the election campaign
 is bich raaje kaam na karne vaale adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai karke yaa unhen dauron kaa aadesh dekar "sakht prashasnic'' netaa kii apni chhavi dobaaraa kaayam karne kii koshish kar rahi hai
 According to sources, the Chief Minister is waiting for the right time to start campaigning for the assembly elections by visiting around 50 assembly constituencies in the last six months
 raaje or unke sahyogiyon ke liye zyada chintaa kii baat yah he ki rajya bhaajapa ikai main aatmavishvaas kii kami he
 An internal survey has revealed that most of the booth-level workers' names are left on the list
 1 june ko jaipur main party sanghathan kii ek baithak main aamantrit kareeb ek-tihaai log nadaarad the
 On that occasion, Raje scolded his ministers and mlas for showing arrogance to party workers
 unhone kaha ki party ke varisht padaadhikariyon ko sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon kii jaankaree hi nahin he or kaaryakarta congress ke prachaar kaa jawaab nahin de paa rahe hai
 National Joint Secretary V
 satish ko apane vidhayakon ko sarkaar or party kii aalochana na karne kii chetavanee deni padi
 Obviously, the next few months are not easy for the Chief Minister
 *** Mukesh Sahni said that all the leaders of the Mahagathbandhan will meet together first, think Manjhi said - RJD has made Tejashwi the CM face, the Mahagathbandhan has not announced the assembly elections in Bihar next year
 is
 magar mahagathbandhan ke netaaon ko tejasvi kaa netritv sweekaar nahin he
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the leaders of the Grand Alliance contested Tejashwi as the leader but in the 2020 assembly elections, the leader of the Grand Alliance and the face of the Chief Minister is not acceptable to the leaders of the Grand Alliance
 kya argedy ne liya ekatarfa faisla?jis tareeke se 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main tejasvi ke netritv main mahagathbandhan ko karaari shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa or ab 21 oktober ko hone vaale bihar vidhansabha ke 5 siton par upachunaav ko lekar argedy ne ekatarfa faisla lete hue 4 siton par ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa kar di he isse mahagathbandhan ke netaaon main kaaphi rosh he
 Angered by this alleged arbitrariness of Tejashwi, the National President of Hindustani Awam Morcha and former Chief Minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi and Mukesh Sahni, the President of Vikas Insaan Party, have fielded their candidates against 2 RJD candidates in the by-election
 jithan ram maanjhi bole pehle karenge vichaarhindustani awam morcha ke rashtriya adhyaksh jithan ram maanjhi ne kaha, 'argedy ne tejasvi ko mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa banaaya he, yah argedy kaa mat he magar yah mahagathbandhan kaa mat nahin he
 It is not possible that if RJD considers Tejashwi as the face of the Chief Minister, then other leaders of the Grand Alliance should also accept this
 2020 main mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar koun hoga yah mahagathbandhan ke netaa samay aane par mil baith kar baat karenge or vichaar karenge
 Mukesh Sahni, president of the Vikas Insan Party, also said that the leader of the alliance has not come together so that someone can be made the leader
 vikasshil insaan party ke adhyaksh mukesh saahani ne kaha, 'mahagathbandhan keval ek dal se nahin balki paanch dalon ko jodakar bana he
 Who will be the face of the Chief Minister in 2020 has not been discussed yet and all the leaders of the Grand Alliance will sit together and consider it
 'haalanki, argedy ne kaha he ki vakt aane par mahagathbandhan ke sabhi netaa tejasvi ko hi mukhyamantri ke taur par maanenge
 Party MLA Bhai Birendra said that in 2020, Tejashwi Yadav will also be the face of the Chief Minister and no agreement can be reached on this
 argedy vidhayak ne bhai birendra kaha, 'agar 2020 main hamaari sarkaar banati he to nishchit taur par tejasvi hi mukhyamantri honge
 The name of Tejashwi has been announced for the Chief Minister only after everyone's consent is reached

 Following the order of the Supreme Court, the central government was taking an ordinance on triple talaq

 He said that this kind of joint venture agreement is the best example of cooperative federalism for the development of the nation which is envisaged by the Prime Minister
 is avasar pararelway bordake chairman ne kaha ki aaj ke sanyukt udhyam samjhaute se kerala kii janata kii rail parivahan sambandhi jaruratein puri hongi
 He said that the railways wanted to expand the rail network at all places, especially in states where the demand is relatively high and the rail density is low

 There is widespread demand from the Railways for the expansion of the network, as the railway line plays the role of a growth engine in the area where it is laid
 2
 Railways are working on a large number of new lines, gauge conversion and doubling projects, around 3 for completion

 However, it is a proven fact that there is a need to improve the density of railway network across the country and the states coming forward in this direction is a welcome step
 7
 The signing of agreements related to these joint ventures will go a long way in the development of infrastructure in the state of Kerala

 Reminded that the talk of EVM also started during Congress, its benefits were also made at the same time
 unhone kaha ki jo log khud par bharosa nahin rakhte, ve iviem kaa bahaanaa bana rahe hai

 Especially discussed the Women's Reservation Bill
 yah baat saafe taur par dikhti rahi ki pradhanmantri ne apana raajnneetik agenda saaf kar diya he
 In both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha houses, he took an aggressive stand on the Congress, while constantly seeking support from the opposition

 Leader of Opposition in Madhya Pradesh Assembly Gopal Bhargava has asked that where is the industry? First of all, tell us how much investment did you bring to Davos? How will you provide employment when there is no industry? Let me tell you that on December 17 last year, a few hours after taking oath as Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath had said in Bhopal that due to the people of states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh Local people do not get jobs

 See their first Facebook post Hello, Facebook! i finally got my very own page
 i hope you’ll think of this as a place where we can have real conversations about the most important issues facing our country – a place where you can hear directly from me, and share your own thoughts and stories
 (you can expect some just-for-fun stuff, too
 )i’m kicking it off by inviting you to take a walk with me in my backyard – something i try to do at the end of the day before i head in for dinner
 i say this often, but that's because it's always at the front of my mind: we've got to preserve this beautiful planet of ours for our kids and grandkids
 And that means taking serious steps to address climate change once and for all
 Now, we've made a lot of progress to cut carbon pollution here at home, and we're leading the world to take action as well
 But we’ve got to do more
 In a few weeks, I'm heading to Paris to meet with world leaders about a global agreement to meet this challenge
 i hope you'll join me in speaking out on climate change and educating your friends about why this issue is so important
 At a time when nearly three in four adults online use Facebook, this feels like a great place to do it
 Share your thoughts in the comments, and pass this message on to folks you think need to see it
 If we're all in this together, I'm confident we can solve this and do right by future generations

 ' sirsa deraa ke alaava, amritsar ke najadik beas main radha swami dere kaa bhi punjab main khaasaa prabhaav he

 They believe that core data remains secure in any kind of system, but when this data is shared under a program, the identity information of the person can be misused
 doosraa sawaal: aadhaar number li hone ke kya parinaam honge?july 2017 main jharkhand sarkaar kii samaajik suraksha website par rajya ke vriddhavastha pension yojana ke labhaarthiyon kaa aadhaar number, naam, pataa or bank acount number saajha kiya gaya tha
 On which a dispute arose
 is vivaad par UIDAI kaa kahana tha ki aadhaar number saajha hone par vyakti kii niztaa se koi samjhauta nahin he
 However, according to the Aadhaar Act, making Aadhaar number public is considered illegal
 aalochakon kii raay he ki aadhaar number saarvajanik hone kii surat main vyakti kii pahchaan kaa anyathaa istemaal ho saktaa he kyonki yah number dobaaraa badla nahin ja saktaa
 In February, in a case in Ahmedabad, the police found that a 32-year-old man named Tarun Sureja had misused the Aadhaar number of a deceased and hit a finance company for Rs 1
5 lakh
 vahiin march main bollywood abhinetri urvashi rotela ke farji aadhaar ke jariye mumbai main ek hotel kaa cameraa bhi book kiya gaya tha
 Third question: should biometric be used for authenticity? UIDAI argues that biometrics is more secure than a password-like system
 UIDAI aisa nahin maanati ki biometric pramanikta koi samasya he
 Critics are of the opinion that such technology exists in which an object can be defrauded through fingerprints of the person and photos shared on social media
 saal 2014 main havers ne germany kii raksha mantri ursula won der leyaan ke soshal media par saajha kiye gaye hai rijolution photo se farji fingerprint bana liya tha
 The second argument of critics is that you cannot change your biometrics after such fraud
 is tarah ke dhokhadhadi kaa maamla july main hyderabad main saamne aayaa tha jab ek simcard oparator ne aadhaar par aadhaarit i-kevaisi ke madhyam se 6000 simcard actevet kar die thea
 Fourth question: Increasing incidents related to Aadhaar security In February 2017, UIDAI filed a criminal case against Axis Bank, Suvidha Infoserve and another company when a person made 397 unauthorized transactions through biometric between July 2016 and February 2017
 Of
 isi tarah agast 2017 main ek develpar ne i-hospital ap se farjivade ke jariye hajaaron logon ke aadhaar number or nijee jaankaree ekatrit kar lee thim
 In January, the English newspaper Tribune had revealed that the Aadhaar number of crores of people could be acquired through the software available in the amount of Rs 500
 isi maheene angreji akhbaar hifington post ne ek software ke jariye aadhaar panjikaran ke security feechar disable ho jane kaa daawa kiya tha
 However, in this case, UIDAI stated that Aadhaar related information is encrypted end-to-end and remains under the supervision of 24x7 security and fraud management system
 paanchvaan sawaal: aadhaar ko lekar yah khamiyaan kitni gambhir hai?visheshgyon kii raay he ki aadhaar data li suraksha kaa mudda he yaa nahin yah secority audit ke madhyam se hi tay ho saktaa he
 But the audit information is not public
 UIDAI ke siio ne kaha tha ki suraksha ke kaarnon se naam saajha nahin kiya ja saktaa

 sukh-sampatti, yash or santan prapti ke liye mangalvaar kaa vrath rakhana shubh mana jaataa he
 Complete this fast with full devotion by reciting the Tuesday fast story related to Hanuman ji
 mangalvaar vrath katha:pracheen samay kii baat he kisi nagar main ek brahman dampatti rahete the unke koi santan na hon kaaran vah behad dukhi the
 Every Tuesday, Brahmins used to go to the forest to worship Hanuman
 vah puja karke bajrangbali se ek putr kii kaamana karata tha
 His wife also used to fast on Tuesday to get a son
 vah mangalvaar ke din vrath ke ant main hanuman ji ko bhoga lagaakar hi bhojan karti thi
 Dhanu can do this auspicious work even after applying Kharmas; Once on a fast, Brahmani could not make food nor could offer Hanuman ji
 tab usne pran kiya ki vah agle mangalvaar ko hanuman ji ko bhoga lagaakar hi bhojan karegi
 She lay hungry thirsty for six days
 mangalvaar ke din vah behosh ho gai
 Hanuman ji was pleased to see his devotion and devotion
 unhone aashirwad swaroop brahmani ko ek putr diya or kaha ki yah tumhaari bahut seva karegaa
 Sun enters Sagittarius sign, know what will happen to other zodiac signs, Brahmin is very happy after getting the child

 After some time when the Brahmin came home, looking at the child and asked who he was? The wife said that Hanuman ji has given him this child, pleased with the Tuesday fast
 yah sunakar brahman ko apni patni kii baat par vishwaas nahin hua
 One day, the Brahmin dropped the child into the well
 ghar par lautne par brahmani ne poocha ki mangal kahaan he? tabhi peeche se mangal muskura kar aa gaya
 The Brahmin was shocked to see her back
 usee raat ko bajrangbali ne brahman ko sapane main darshan die or bataaya ki yah putr unhone hi use diya he
 The Brahmin became very happy knowing the truth
 jiske baad se brahman dampatti niyamit rup se mangalvaar vrath rakhane lage
 Hanuman ji has immense grace on a person observing the fast of Tuesday

 It is now clearly visible that 38-year-old Sachin Pilot is registering his strong presence

 The same son of the Air Force officer-turned-father is slowly but solidly emerging as the man who will help the Congress overcome its present crisis
 jaipur main rajasthan congress kaa mukhyalay 3 march ko us samay gahamagahami se bharaa tha, jab purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot payalat ke netritv par muhar lagane par hichakate najar aae
 Perhaps they will realize that they are being overthrown forever by a young and clearly more charismatic pilot
 upar se unke bete vaibhav ko party tikat dene se inkaar kar diya gaya
 For more than two decades, Gehlot, who ruled the state Congress committee uninterrupted, became restless and this became evident
 us samay unka cheharaa sakht ho gaya or us par dehshat kii lakeeren dikhne lageen, jab varisht upaadhyaksh vishvendra singh ne party se pisisi pramukh ke samarthan main ekajute hone kaa aahvaan kiya
 Vishwendra has been the king of the erstwhile Jat princely state of Bharatpur and joined the state Congress executive in February with 200 other supporters under Pilot's supervision
 vishvendra ne jab vahaan maujuud logon se poocha ki ''kya aap sab sachin payalat ke netritv ko sweekaar karte hai?'' yah vahaan maujuud logon ke liye ek kism kaa elaan zyada tha—safagoi se iraadon kaa elaan
 There was also a small number of people who separated themselves from the crowd full of passion expressing their support for the pilot
 lalchand kataaria ne kanni kaat lee
 Former Union Minister and AICC Secretary General C

 Joshi's trusted Kataria has been a contender for the post of Congress president, which went to Pilot in 2014
 vishvendra singh ko acchhee tarah pataa tha ki is baithak kaa ek-ek byoraa dilli main rahul gandhi ke paas pahunchaaya jayega, isiilie unhone chaturaai se apane sawaal ko manch par maujuud party ke diggaj netaaon kii ore oochaal diya
 Gurudas Kamat, the general secretary in charge of Rajasthan at AICC, first raised his hand
 yah dusron ke liye bhi aisa hi karne kaa ishaara tha
 The trick came - Girija Vyas, who was the President of the State Congress and was marginalized at the hands of Gehlot

 D
 kalla sabhi payalat kaa samarthan karne waalon kii badhati bheed main shaamil ho gaye
 Gehlot, who is clearly unconcerned and besieged, also laid down his arms and pointed with his left hand
 chaar din baad 7 march ko unhone apni bhaawanaaon kaa izhaar kar diya
 He said, "vishwendra keeps organizing such hands
 pisisi adhyaksh or vipaksh ke netaa chunaav main aguai jarur karte hai, magar mukhyamantri yaa to hikeman chunata he yaa nirvaachit vidhayak chunate hai
 "they are still hoping to return for the third time
" magar unke apane partygen jis tarah se khuleam unki aalochana kar rahe hai, uske maddenjar yah unke man kaa laddu bhi sabit ho saktaa he
 Many see his apparent reluctance to accept the leadership of the pilot as gross 'jealousy'
 apni rajasi saakh kii badaulat swatantra haisiyat rakhane vaale vishvendra singh kehete hai ki gahalot chhotaapan dikhaa rahe hai
 He said, "I felt sorry
" gahalot ne (congress kaa) ekajute cheharaa pesh karne kii hamaari koshishon par pani pher diya
 He has played his innings
 unke liye ab payalat ko apana aashirwad dene kaa samay aa gaya he
 "there is no doubt that the star of the pilot has risen due to Gehlot's rapidly losing support in the Rajasthan Congress
" purv public health ejeeniyar or 2014 main congress main shaamil hone ke liye svaichhik sevanivritti lene vaale susheel asopa ne fasebuk par purv mukhyamantri kii tikhi aalochana kii or yahaan tak salaah de daali ki unhen sanyas' le lenaa chahie
 Asopa says that even after two terms of the chief minister, the PCC chairmanship for eight years and several times as Union Minister, when Gehlot became the chief minister, he only managed to sink the boat of the Congress in his home state of Rajasthan
 yahaan tak ki purv vidhayak or swargeey bhaironsingh shekhavat ke bhattije pratap singh khachariyavaas sareekhee swatantra awaajen bhi gahalot se niraash hai
 He says, "A veteran leader like Gehlot should not have done the pilot's evil in public
" ''aakhir vah kya he jisaki vajah se ashok gahalot sareekha anbhavi shaks sachin payalat sareekhe nausikhua se itnaa daraa hua he? sabase ahm baat yah he ki hameshaa gandhi parivaar ke khaas rahe gahalot ab payalat main ek majboot, zyada yuva or siyaasi taur par zyada chatur or jaankaar pratidwandvi dekh rahe hai, jisaki nae bos rahul gandhi tak sidhi or swatantra pahunch he
 The party, led by Gehlot, suffered its worst defeat so far (21 out of 200 seats) in the 2013 assembly elections, due to which the situation has become more difficult for him
 yah sach he ki gurjar samudaay se aane vaale payalat ke kabje main rajasthan kaa koi bada jatigat vot bank nahin hai, lekin ve chunaavon main acha-khaasaa asar rakhane vaale meenaon kaa bharosa jeetne main kaamyaab rahe hai, jo unhen unke divangat pita rajesh payalat jaisi kshamtaaon se las bhavi netaa ke taur par dekhte hai
 Even Jats consider the pilot as 'fair', who went against Gehlot for tricking Parasram Maderna (jat Siyasatdan) from becoming chief minister in 1998 and later denying the Jats from joining the OBC quota

 The Congress could not win a single seat
 iske baavjood unhone ajmer se chunaav ladgaye kaa faisla kiya taaki unke upar ladaai se peeth dikhaakar bhaagane kaa iljaam na lage

 '' payalat ne 14 march ko barmer main kaha or party ke safaaye tathaa khud apni haar ke baavjood ve nai takat ke saath ubhare
 In September 2014, he presented a tough challenge to the ruling BJP in the by-election for four assembly seats vacated by BJP mlas being elected as mps

 Working through the Congress's traditional institutions — the Youth Congress, the Women's Congress, the Seva Dal and NSUI — she filled the state unit with so much enthusiasm that it shocked everyone by winning three out of four by-elections
 
 raaje or unki party ke paseene chhudaane ke liye itnaa hi nahin hua
 Under the supervision of the pilot, NSUI won the student union elections of Rajasthan University in 2014 and 2015 continuously

 '' ve bataate hai ki unhen us samay hairaani hui jab rahul gandhi ne payalat kii sifarish par unhen jaipur congress ikai kaa prabharee bana diya
 Pilot also reversed the notion that the opposition should 'sit hand in hand' in five years of ousting from power
 pisisi pramukh ke taur par unhone andhadhundh yatraaen kii hai or rajasthan ke 33 jilon main se harek main do saal main do baar gaye, jahaan unhone party kaaryakartaaon ke saath baithken kin, yuva kaaryakartaaon se baatcheet kii or diggajon se mulaakaaten kin
 "there is no doubt that he is the most accessible party president ever," says a young Congress worker
 ''rajasthan main agle vidhansabha chunaav 2018 main honge, lekin payalat pehle hi chunaav ke andaaj main aa chuke hai
 Always ready to beat the government, Raje says whenever he gets the chance, "I know i have to build the party brick-by-brick
" '' unhone khanan ghotaale par lagaataar logon kaa dhyaan banaae rakhaa he, yahaan tak ki unhone sieji kaa bhi darwaja khatkhataya or bharat sarkaar ke ek paripatr kaa ulanghan karte hue 'pehle aao, pehle paao' ke aadhaar par 600 khadaanon ke aavanton main hui gadbaditon kii jaanch ke liye majaboor kar diya
 In October 2015, Raje had to cancel these allocations
 unhone rajasthan main balaatkaar kii teji se badhati ghatnaon par lagaam lagane main naakaami par mukhyamantri raaje ko aade haathon liya
 Due to the stand taken by the pilot on social issues, due to the effective NGO sector of Rajasthan, he has taken up arms
 alabatta 2018 ke chunaavon main durjey raaje kaa muqabla karne se pehle unhen abhi lanbaa rasta tay karnaa he
 Common people do not know much about his alternative vision
 ise pesh karke unhen logon ko party ke paale main laana he

 bataaya ja rahaa he ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav memparajay ke baadayah party kaa sabase bada shivi hoga
 About 15 years ago in 2000, the Congress also organized a similar thinking camp in Mathura

 Singh said, "the audience sees the film they like, which has a good story and message and we are happy that 'jolly LLB 2' has met expectations
" hamen ummid he ki shuukravaar ko jari hui film kii kamai saptahanth par adhik hogi
 Akshay's wife Twinkle Khanna has also said that she is very happy with the response the film is getting
 'jolly elelbi 2' main akshay ke alaava, annu kapur, huma kuraishi or saurabh shukla bhi pramukh bhoomikaaon main hai
 a fire broke out in a firecracker factory in Jalgaon district of Maharashtra, killing 30 people
 pataakhe kii factory jalakar puri tarah khaak ho gayi
 Due to being away from the city, there was also a delay in reaching the fire engine
 jalgaanv jile ke parola gaanv kii pataakhaa factory maut kii factory ban gai
 a terrible fire erupted with an explosion in the factory and upon seeing it, 150 to 200 people working in the factory were engulfed
 dhamaake kii vajah se factory kii chat neeche aa giri or kaaphi logon ko jaan bachaane tak kaa mauka nahin mila
 In fact, Parola village, where the firecracker factory was located, is a short distance from the city and due to this, fire engines were late in reaching the spot
 raahat dal ke pahunchane main hui deree kii vajah se marane waalon kii taadaad badhati chali gai
 At present, the number one Test Indian team can achieve the top position in one-day matches, but for this they will have to win all the matches of the tri-series in Bangladesh and also in this Pakistan team's upcoming five-match series
 You will also have to pray for victory over Australia
 bharat ne test team main number ek ranking hasil kar pehle hi gada hasil kar lee he, lekin vah isisi vanade ranking main 123 ank se duusare sthaan par kabiz he jabaki austrailian team 130 ank se sheersh par he
 But India have a chance to remove Australia from the top, but for this Dhoni's men will have to defeat both Sri Lanka and host Bangladesh in the tri-series starting on Monday in Mirpur
 lekin use yah bhi ummid kerani hogi ki pakistani team 22 janvari se shuru hone vaali paanch maichon kii shrinkhalaa main austrailia par jeet darj kare
 a 4-1 or worse result in the series for Ricky Ponting's team will be enough to remove him from the top, and it will be in India's favor

 Happy birthday jannu
 @janhvikapoor # 21stbirthdaya post shared by sonamkapoor (@sonamkapoor) on Mar 5, 2018 at 11:15am psthappy Birthday my dearest @janhvikapoor May God Bless you With Happiness Love Peace and Just Everything 
 a post shared by Manish Malhotra (@ manishmalhotra05) on Mar 5, 2018 at 10:42 am pston my birthday, the only thing i ask of all of you is that you love your parents
 Cherish them and devote yourself to making them feel that love
 They have made you
 And i ask that you remember my mother fondly, pray for her soul to rest in peace
 Let the love and adulation you'll showered on her continue and please know that the biggest part of my mother was the love she shared with papa
 And their love is immortal because there was nothing like it in the whole world
 Nothing as joyful and pure and no two people as devoted to one another as they were
 Please respect that because it hurts to think anyone would ever try to tarnish it
 Preserving the sanctity of what they had would mean the world not only to my mother but also to a man who's entire being revolved around her, and her two children who are all that remains of their love
 Me and Khushi have lost our mother but papa has lost his “jaan”
 She was so much more than just an actor or a mother or a wife
 She was the ultimate and the best in all these roles
 It mattered a great deal to her to give love and to get love
 For people to be good and gracious and kind
 She didn't understand frustration or malice or jealousy
 So let’s be that
 Let's be full of only good and give only love
 That would make her happy, to know that even in death, she gave you all something
 The courage and inspiration to fill yourselves with nothing but love and rid yourselves of bitterness in any way and form
 That’s what she stood for
 Dignity, strength and innocence
 Thank you for the love and support everyone has shown us in the past couple of days
 It's given us hope and strength and we can't thank you all enough
 a post shared by Janhvi Kapoor (@janhvikapoor) on Mar 2, 2018 at 10:09pm PST The superstar Amitabh Bachchan has been over 65 years old, but in the world of entertainment, he is still the most wanted
 itane zyada wanted ki colors channel apane sho big bos ke har apisod ke badale amitabh ko de rahaa he dedh karod rupaya
 Amitabh will participate in about 16 episodes
 chote parde par bade kariyar kaa modakshay kumaar, salmaan khan or shahrukh khan sabane sapana sanjoya tivi kii duniya main sabase keemtee star banane kaa, isliye inhone duusari pari shuru kii
 All of these could not even touch the popularity of Amitabh Bachchan's 'kaun Banega Crorepati' in his first innings on TV, but it seems that in the second innings, once again everyone may have to face it
 amitabh bachchan ko colors par shuru ho rahe big bos ke har apisod ke badale main diya ja rahaa he dedh karod rupaya
 No stars are getting so much money on TV right now
 yani bujurg amitabh bachchan main abhi bahut dam baaki he
 Amitabh Bachchan has been signed for one and a half crore rupees for every episode of Bigg Boss, according to Amitabh Most Expensive TV Artist Formulas
 uske baad number aata he akshay kumaar kaa
 It is said that Akshay Kumar is taking 1
25 crore for every episode of Khatron Ke Khiladi
 soni tivi ke sho das kaa dam ke har apisod ke liye salmaan le rahe hai kareeb nabbe lakh rupee
 It is said that each episode of Shahrukh was worth 75 lakhs for Star Plus show fifth pass
 yani amitabh kaa graph aaj bhi sabase ooncha he
 It makes us feel fresh, as often as Amitabh comes to the screen, he feels new freshness
 yahi vajah he ki koi amitabh nahin ban paa rahaa
 This emperor of cinema has now become the Big Boss of TV
 bollywood main ye baat khari sabit ho rahi he ki amitabh bhale hi bujurg ho gayi ho lekin mahanayake to vahi he
 Amitabh's credentials showed his power by taking one and a half crore rupees for every episode of the boss, but the biggest question is how Amitabh will save his credibility, because the dignity of Amitabh is as high as the previous two big bosses
 Have been proved dedh karod rupee lekar amitabh kii jimmedaari hogi har hasti ke banaavati chehre ke peeche chupe asli chehre ko pesh karne kii
 There is an image in the minds of the entertainment world legend Amitabh Bachchan who has seen him on TV so far
 amitabh kii saumy, shaleen or raubadaar awaz
 Kaun Banega Crorepati was the name of a very serious and dignified show
 bauddhikta se koi lenaa-dena nahishmitabh ko ab tak tivi par dekhne ke liye jo darshak aate the, unka ek bauddhik str tha, lekin ab vahi amitabh ek aise sho main aa rahe hai jiskaa bauddhikta se koi sarokaar nahin he
 It is difficult for a person like Amitabh himself, how will he face such fights and problems every day
 wo kaise karenge aisi foohadataa kaa saamana
 How will you tolerate the language of Bigg Boss, which does not even seem to coincide with a great personality like Amitabh? mehmaanon kaa rakhana hoga khyalamitabh agar big bos hai, to unke mehmaanon har haal main unki garima kaa bhi khyaal to rakhana hoga
 In such a situation, whoever will become a part of Bigg Boss, will always be respected by Amitabh's personality
 agar kahin manoranjan ke liye bigabos kaa purana formet vaisaa hi rahaa, to amitabh ko kahin yah naa kahana pade ki dedh crores lekar kahaan funs gayi? Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Shazia Ilmi has said that Muslim votes are divided, as they are too secular and should become somewhat communal and cast their votes keeping in mind their 'personal interest'
 shajia ne kaha, bahut zyada dharmanirpeksh mat hoie
 Muslims are very secular, they should become communal
 ve sampradayik nahin hote hai or apane liye vot nahin daalate
 Arvind Kejriwal belongs to us
 musalmaan lambey samay tak dharmanirpeksh rahe
 
 
 Voted Congress and helped them win
 itnaa dharmanirpeksh mat hoie or is baar apane ghar (samudaay) kii ore bhi dekhie
 Other parties, he said, have their own united vote banks and Muslim votes are divided
 yah ek vivaadaaspad bayaan he, lekin hamen apane hit kii ore dekhnaa chahie
 The AAP candidate from Ghaziabad is seen talking to Muslim community members in a video
 aam aadmi party ne twitor par jari ek sandesh main is bayaan se apane ko alag karte hue kaha, hamaare sabhi pratinidhiyon ko shabdon ke chayan main satark rahanaa chahie, taaki uski galat vyakhya kii koi gunjaaish nahin rahe
 AAP leader Manish Sisodia tweeted, i saw the clip of Shazia
 unhen yah nahin kahana chahie
 AAP does not believe in communal policy
 hamaari raajnneeti sabhi bharatiyon ko ekajute karne kii he
 After the controversy erupted over Ilmi's statement, the AAP candidate from Ghaziabad said that he had not made any such remarks that spread hatred
 unhone kaha, main is par kaayam hum
 i said that we should think about the community first
 jab anya dharmanirpeksh nahin hai, to ham kyon dharmanirpeksh hon
 It is to play with words
 dilli vidhansabha main netaa vipaksh vijendra gupta ne dilli sarkaar se maang kii he ki vah nursery kakshaon main daakhile ke liye tatkaal ek spasht, paardarshee or abhibhavak hitkaari kanoon banaaen
 Without enacting the law, it will not be able to get millions of weaker and disadvantaged children into private schools
 gupta ne kejariwal sarkaar paranijee skulon ke maalikonke saath santh-ganth karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha he ki navambar 2015 main dilli sarkaar ne bagaiyr kanoon banaae ek bill laakar skulon dwaara kiye ja rahe screening prakriya par pratibandh laga diya tha
 This was done so that school owners receiving land at cheaper rates from the government should not stop the way to collect donations from parents
 nursery kakshaon main pravesh, skulon dwaara manamaani fees vasuulne kaa nirnay tathaa nijee skulon dwaara apane karmchaariyon ko kam vetan dekar unka shoshan karne par dilli sarkaar skool maalikon ke hi saath he
 That is why since November 2015 till date, the government has not made regular laws for entry of nencers
 vijendra gupta ne kaha ki jabatak sakht kanoon nahin banaaya jaataa, nijee skulon ke maalik aarthik rup se kamjor tathaa vanchit varg ke bacchon ko apane skulon main pravesh nahin denge
 Knowing that private schools are not obliged to obey the administrative orders issued by the government in the absence of a valid law, the government is giving private schools an open leeway to arbitrariness and corruption by just issuing administrative orders
 isse lakhon abhibhavakon kaa khule taur par aarthik shoshan kiya ja rahaa he
 Parents who do not have the financial status to pay heavy fees and donations, their children will have a dark future in the new education session, as they will not be able to get admission in schools

 And now in the era of Digital India, the move of India's government and private data abroad through internet and smartphones is considered as data colonialism
 nav upniveshwaad ke is kutsit tantra ko todane ke liye bajet main praavdhaan hone chahie
 Why government should consider valuable data like oil useless: Indian data is going abroad through e-commerce, social media and payment banks and now foreign companies are eyeing the base data breach
 vyakti kaa nijee data bhale hi bekaar dikhataa ho,par127karod kii aabaadi vaale desh main samoohon kaa data nae jamaane kaa tel he

 ham sabhi acchhee tarah se jaanate hai ki der raat main khaane se vajan badhane ke saath anidra or swasthya sambandhi kai samasyaon kaa khatra bana rahata he
 But even nowadays most of the people keep eating something till late night
 har khaane kii apni apni khaasiyat hoti hai
 But we should take care of which things to eat when
 kyonki kuch chijen aisi hoti hai, jinako khaane se hamaari sehat or neend donon par hi bura asar padataa he
 We are telling you about some things which should be avoided during night time
 raat main in 6 chizon kaa seven na karen-1
 French fries-fried potatoes are liked by all, but they are not good for your sleep and health at all
 raat ke samay french friese or aalu ke chips kaa seven karne se bachein
 Due to health problems due to their consumption, sleep is also impaired
 2
 Tea-taking a nice hot cup of tea before bed is definitely pleasant, but try to avoid it
 chahen blike tii ho yaa green tii sabhi main caffeine hota he, jo aapaki neend main baadha daal saktaa he
 Even a decoction of herbal water can soak you in the bathroom in the middle of the night
 3
 Ice Cream - Who doesn't want to enjoy a favorite flavored ice cream in the cold of the night? But ice cream is full of fat and eating it late at night can cause acidity 4
 pizza-der raatmensnacks ke taur par pizza kaa seven sunne main bahut acha lagata he, lekin iskaa order dene se pehle saavdhaan rahen
 Pizza contains a lot of fat, which can upset your digestive system
 5
 Chocolate - Most people are fond of eating chocolate
 lekin ise raat main nahin khaanaa chahie
 Actually, chocolate contains caffeine, which can hamper your sleep
 6
 Soda drinks - Soda drinks contain no nutrients and are full of calories
 isko pine se sehat ko to nuksaan pahunchataa hi he, saath hi aap thik tarah se so bhi nahin pate hai
 The city has changed after the arrival of Yogiraj in the city of Taj Mahal
 iskaa ehsaas agra kii sadakon par chalate hue aapako khud bakhud hone lagata he
 Till a month ago, where was it possible to put a saffron flag on the walls of the mosque and no one dared to remove it
 lekin hinduvadi sanghathan ke logon kaa josh agar deevaaron par jhande lagane tak hi simit rahata tab bhi ganimat thi
 Adityanath Yogi, who wore saffron clothes, took over the chair of the Chief Minister of UP, some people have assumed that the law cannot be tightened on them after putting saffron on their neck
 pehle samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar ko gundon kii sarkaar kehane vaale kuch logon kaa josh itnaa bad gaya ki wo thane main ghuskar police adhikariyon ke saath marpet karke aropiyon ko hawalat se chhudaa kar le jane kii koshish bhi karne lage
 When the police caught five people on the charge of assault, around 70-80 bikes and scooters parked at Sadar police station in Agra city are witness to the clash between the miscreants and the police here on Saturday evening
 darasal police yahaan par paanch logon ko pakadakar laai thi, jinke upar yah aarope tha ki unhone agra ke fatehpur sikri thane main kuch logon ke saath marpet kii
 When the people gathered around the police station to free them, they created a ruckus and the matter came to a scuffle with the police officers, the accused were taken out of the police and brought them to the Sadar police station in Agra city, 40 km away
 lekin bajrang dal or vishwa hindu parishad ke log apane saathiyon ko chhudaane ke liye yahaan bhi aa dhamke
 a sit-in demonstration took place earlier and when the matter did not work, they tried to forcefully free the accused from the lockup
 pehle thane par patharav hua lekin jab police ne jawaab main laathiyaan barsaanaa shuru kiya to log bhaag khadey hue or unki gaadiyaan yaheen par chhot gai jo ab thane main khadi hai

 Among those who tried to get rid of the accused by going to the police station, Uday Bhan Singh of BJP was also involved and this fact has also been mentioned in the FIR
 lekin udai bhaan singh aarope lagaate hai ki sarkaar badalane ke baad bhi bahut saare police vaale samaajawaadee party sarkaar ke agent ke taur par hi kaam kar rahe hai
 He says that the irresponsible action of the policemen is responsible for what happened in Agra
 police par sarkaar kaa koi dabaav nahipulisake kai adhikari kehete hai ki sari musiibat kii jad ye he ki bijepi or isse judi kai hinduvadi sanghathanon ke neeche ke kaaryakarta niraash hai
 He hoped that all police and administration officials would be changed from top to bottom as soon as power was changed
 lekin aisa hua nahin
 Agra's SP rural Mansharam Gautam says that the government has not come under any pressure, at least for now
 duusare police adhikari bataate hai ki satta badalte hi kuch log apni dhauns thanon par abhi se jamaa lenaa chaahate hai taaki aage unka kaam or kamai thik se chalati rahe

 agra kii ghatana ke baad ham logon ne faisla kiya he ki ab wo log dharna-pradarshan nahin karenge
 People of Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal are now trying to get Agra Police officers removed immediately so that their dignity can be saved
 lekin philhal police tabadale kaa dar chhod kar sakhti se karrwai kar rahi he or bache hue aropiyon ko khojane main juty he

 sarkaar kam keemton par fasal bechney vaale kisaanon ko unke nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye ek nirdhaarit rakam dene kii bhi skim laa sakati he
 BJP President Amit Shah had arrived at his residence on Thursday to meet Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh

 In this meeting, several options for giving relief to the farmers were discussed
 aise main modi sarkaar kisaanon ke liye ek alag se skim laane par vichaar kar rahi he
 Under this scheme, the losses of the farmers who sell the crops at low prices will be compensated
 iske liye sarkaar kisaan ke bank khate main sidhe ek nirdhaarit rakam transfar karegi
 According to sources, the Modi government will soon prepare a plan for this scheme by meeting with different ministries in this direction
 haalanki niti ayog kii taraf se bhi modi sarkaar ko sujhava gaye medium turm stretiji ke jariye kisaanon ko raahat di jaae
 Under this, if the prices of crops fall below the minimum support price (MSP), then farmers should be given subsidy and relief
 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue kisaanon par bhi ab raajnneeti tej ho gai he
 In such a situation, there are speculations about meeting with the Union Agriculture Minister with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then BJP President that the central government can take a big step towards farmers

 JDU has said that the people have got justice from this decision
 jadyu ke pravaktaa sanjay singh ne argedy upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari par tanj kasate hue kaha he ki unki vajah se hi lalu ko yah sajaa mili he kyonki shivanand tiwari sabase pehle chaara ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye nyaayalay main yachika daali thi
 Sanjay Singh said that even after the declaration of punishment, even though Sivananda Tiwari is shedding crocodile tears in Lalu's house 10, Circular Road, it will be heartwarming that due to him Lalu has to go to jail again
 gauratlab he ki lalu ke khilaaf shivanand tiwari ne hi patna hoicourt main yachika daalkar chaara ghotaale main jaanch kii maang kii thi
 The JDU also questioned what the party has to say after Lalu's conviction, while another convict Jagdish Sharma (bhumihar) has been sentenced to 7 years in the same case
 gauratlab he ki, doshi qaraar die jane ke samay argedy ke netaaon ne yah tippanee kii ki purv mukhyamantri jagannatha mishra jo kibrahman hai,unhen jaj ne is puure maamle main bari kar diya magar pichhadi jati saamne vaale lalu ko doshi qaraar de diya tha
 Sanjay Singh said that the RJD leaders who look at the judiciary through ethnic prism should be ashamed
 sanjay singh ne is baat ko lekar bhi tanj ksaa kii argedy ke varisht netaa jaise jagadanand singh, abdul baari siddiki, ramchandra purve, shivanand tiwari or raghuvansh prasad singh ko 90 ke dashak main rabari devi kaa netritv sweekaar karnaa padaa or ab lalu ke jail jane ke baad unke chote bete tejasvi ke netritv ko sweekaar karnaa he
 Sanjay Singh said that the leadership of JDU is in the hands of an engineer like Nitish Kumar, on the other hand, now the RJD is headed by a person like Tejashwi, a non-matricide
 salmaan khan kii shaadi kaa intjaar unke sabhi phans besabri se kar rahe hai
 The question of marriage to Salman or his family is also asked
 aajkal to unki shaadi ko lekar atakalein bhi tej ho gayi hai ki salmaan apni garlfriend ulia se is saal 18 november ko shaadi karenge
 When Salbaan's brother Arbaaz Khan was asked about this in an interview, Arbaaz looked somewhat angry
 arbaj ne kaha, 'salmaan kii shaadi kab or kisase hogi ye sochane kaa kaam unka nahin he
 This is Salman's personal life and he will decide his own marriage
 'unhone to yahaan tak kah diya kisalmanaki shaadi ke bare main jitna sab jaanate hai utana main bhi jaanata hum
 This statement of Arbaaz does shock us, but whether or not Salman will get married this year, he will tell only in the coming time

 What did Shobha Dey tweet, created a ruckus in Maharashtra's political light
 pehle emenes mukhiya raaj thakare kii pratikriya ai
 After that, Shiv Sena leader and spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that Shobhaa Dey had drunk liquor by going to a page three party and was talking about it while drunk
 unke khilaaf maharashtra droh kaa maamla darj kar unhen jail bhej dena chahie
 NCP leader Nawab Malik also condemned Shobha De's tweet saying that the people here have made huge sacrifices for Mumbai
 udhar maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke pramukh raaj thakare ne shobhaa de par aapattijanak vyaktigat coment kiye
 Shobha had tweeted in a tweet that, like Telangana, Mumbai too can become a separate state
 is par thakare bole ki alag rajya bananaa talaak paane kii tarah aasaan nahin he or shobhaa de ko yah samajhnaa chahie
 Famous columnist and novelist Shobhaa Dey tweeted that 'maharashtra and Mumbai? Why not? Mumbai has always sought its independent identity
 koi na
 This debate has several ends
 ’ isi twit par raaj thakare ne yah baat kahi
 When Shobhaa Dey was asked about Raj Thackeray's reaction, he said, 'I had tweeted this while satirizing on the formation of Telangana
 ise jyon kaa tyon kyon le liya gaya
 i am not advocating for the state of Mumbai
 bakaul shobhaa main to sirf yah dikhaanaa chaahati thi ki chunaav aate partiyaan kis tarah kii harakat karne lagati hai
 Raj's identity is provocative statement: She said right on the statement of Raj Thackeray, no problem, Raj is known only for such inflammatory statements
 raaj thakare ek cartoonist bhi hai
 i am taking his comments as seriously as i take his cartoons
 de ne kaha ki raaj thakare ko vyangy kii auron se behatar samaj honi chahie thi
 Shobhaa De @deshobhaa's tweet Maharashtra and Mumbai ??? Why not? Mumbai has always fancied itself as an independent entity, anyway
 This game has countless possibilities
 The BJP said Page 3 is the party's imprint
 The political attack on Shobha Dey was not limited to MNS alone
 nishaanaa mumbai bijepi ke adhyaksh ashish shellar ne bhi saadhaa
 He said, 'shobhaa De's statement is highly condemnable
 sirf pej3 party kaa hissaa banakar or kollam likhakar aapako is tarah ke bayaan dene kaa adhikaar nahin mil jaataa he
 Shobhaa Dey is not even aware of the history of Mumbai
 'ensipi ne kaha, de jaane mumbai kaa itihaashvahin ensipi pravaktaa nawab malik ne kaha, 'mumbai ko maharashtra kaa hissaa banaae rakhane ke liye 105 logon ne shahadat di thi
 Shobhaa Dey should know the history of Mumbai and Maharashtra
 'gauratlab he ki telugana ke gathan ke baad anya chote rajyon ko lekar maang tej ho gai he
 Leaders of different parties are demanding states like Gorkhaland, Vidarbha and Purvanchal
 shobhaa de kaa twit ko in maangon se jodakar dekha ja saktaa he
 However, Shobhaa Dey tried to handle the matter by looking at the seriousness of the matter
 or apane us twit ko sirf ek vyangay bataaya
 But the arrow had left the command
 nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke badbhole netaaon par kiya ataikasiem nitish bole- endie ekajute, jeetenge 200 se zyada sitembihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne shuukravaar ko jadyu rajya parishad kii baithak ko sambodhit karte hue bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke badbhole netaaon par jamkar nishama saadhaa

 haalanki, nitish kumaar ne kaha ki endie puri tareeke se ekajute he or jo bhi khatpat karegaa vah 2020 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad kahin kaa nahin rahegaa
 Annoyed with BJP leaders Nitish Kumar did not name any BJP leader during his address, but his displeasure was clearly visible for bjp's Fire Brand leader and Union Minister Giriraj Singh and bjp's MLC Sanjay Paswan
 nitish kumaar ne kaha, 'humlog kaam karte hai lekin kuch logon kii aadat he apni publicity ke liye kaam karte hai
 We know who will make a statement against us, only then he will not get publicity 'it is worth mentioning that BJP MLC Sanjay Paswan left a few days ago that Nitish Kumar should go to Delhi and hand over the reins of Bihar to the politics of the Center
 giriraaj ne saadhaa tha nishanaavahin, giriraaj singh ne bhi enarasi (NRC) ke mudde par ishaaron hi ishaaron main nitish kumaar par hamalaa bolte hue bihar main bhi enarasi taiyaar karne kii maang uthaai thi
 On the NRC issue, Giriraj Singh had tweeted recently that the leaders should see the issue of NRC through the prism of the country and not with the prism of the vote
 giriraaj singh ne kaha tha ki simanchal kshetra main jansankhya vruddhi or demographic badlaav kaaphi teji se ho rahaa he jisaki vajah se assam ke tarj par bihar main bhi enarasi taiyaar karne kii jarurat he
 Nitish Kumar said about the upcoming assembly election that the alliance between BJP and JDU is unbreakable
 jis tareeke se 2010 main endie gathbandhan ko 243 main se 206 siten mili thim, usee prakaar agle saal bhi gathbandhan ko 200 se zyada siten milengi
 The video went viral on social media, after which many users misunderstood the creators of the video and said that the lives of people were at stake in the photo-taking affair
 jiske baad ABC ko die bayaan main park officer kris carleone ne kaha ki ye photo disterbing nahin he
 There is nothing wrong in the photo
 soshal media par ye video viral ho gaya, jiske baad kai yugers ne video banane waalon ko galat bataaya or kaha ki photo khinchne ke chakkar main logon kii jaan daanv par lagaai gai
 After which, in a statement to ABC, Park Officer Chris Carlyon said that this photo is not disturbing
 photo main kuch bhi galat nahin he

 a young man was beaten to death for just 180 rupees at Maharajganj in Aurai police station area of bhadohi district of Uttar Pradesh
 police adheekshak rambadan singh ne bataaya ki bhadohi jile ke aurai thana kshetra ke varanasi road par hive ke kinare sardaar dhaba par sahasepur gaanv nivasee vishaal dube apane driver suraj ke saath khaanaa khaane gaye the jahaan 180 rupee ke bill ko lekar dhaba maalik se vivaad ho gaya
 He told that the dhaba owner gave him a bill of 180 rupees, but Vishal Dubey felt that more rupees have been added to the bill
 unhone dhaba maalik se 180 rupee kaa hisaab maanga jise dhaba maalik ne dene se manaa kar diya
 After this, both of them got upset and the dispute increased
 dhaba maalik ne apane karmchaariyon ke saath milakar lathi-dandon se donon yuvakon ko peetna shuru kar diya
 Vishal somehow escaped in this, but his driver Suraj Singh was beaten fiercely, causing injuries to his head
 use ilaaj ke liye varanasi le jaaya ja rahaa tha jahaan raste main usne dam tod diya
 The Superintendent of Police said, "suraj Singh's brother has registered a case of 302 against the dhaba owner and his associates
 dhaba maalik ko hiraasat main le liya he or police anya aropiyon kii talash main juty he
 Strict action will be taken against all those who are guilty in this incident

 Earlier, PM Modi addressed booth workers in Varanasi
 apane road sho kii safalataa kii charchaa karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki sabase pehle aap sabko bahut bahut badhai
 In the scene i was watching yesterday, i was feeling the smell of your hard work and sweat
 piem narendra modi ne kaha ki sabko bahut-bahut badhai, kal jo drishy main dekh rahaa tha, usamen mujhe aapke parishram, aapke paseene kii mahak aa rahi thi
 i felt in dagger-dagger that the workers of Kashi went door-to-door in such heat and asked for their blessings
 main bhi ek booth kaaryakarta tha
 i too have had the privilege of placing posters on the walls
 kashmir se kanyakumari tak utsaah kaa maahaulakaaryakartaaon se piem modi ne kaha ki desh bhar ke kaaryakartaaon kii mehnat he ki aaj kashmir se kanyakumari tak kaashi ghat se porbandar tak utsaah kaa maahaul he
 People in the country themselves are saying - once again the Modi government
 hamaare desh main itane chunaav hue, lekin ye chunaav hone ke baad political panditon ko maathapai kerani padegi, kyonki aazaadee ke baad pehali baar pro inkambansee lahar dikhaai de rahi he
 BJP is fighting for the medium, the public PM Modi said that we are all activist medium and the public is fighting the election
 janata 5 saal ke anubhav ke aadhaar par anek aashaa, aakanksha lekar hamase jud gai he
 The public has changed the political character of the entire country
 janata ne sarkaar chunane kaa man bana liya he
 This is the first time in history that such an election is being held
 janata hamen jaisaa pyaar de rahi he uskaa har pal aabhaar jataana hoga
 Always conscious of his responsibility as MP, PM Modi said that it is the job of the people to form the government and it is our responsibility to run the government and i have fulfilled this responsibility honestly
 aapako main kaaryakarta ke taur par hisaab detaa hum
 As a worker, the party asked me as much time in 5 years, where i did not refuse even once
 mere bheetar ke kaaryakarta ko maine kabhi marane nahin diya
 i am equally conscious of my responsibility as a Prime Minister and also as an MP
 bijepi kaa kaaryakarta bharat maa kaa sipaahi hepiem modi ne kaha ki aaj party hamaari badi he uskaa kaaran tivi yaa akhbaar nahin he
 We do not come from a large family, we are small workers
 jaise raamji ke paas puri vanar sena thi, jaise krishna ji ke paas gwaale the, vaise hi bharat maa ke ham sipaahi hai
 One vote is very important
 As a BJP worker, the difficulty of the Benaras is immense
 kyonki or jagah to sabakaa ummidavaar saath chalakar prachaar karata he, lekin aapkaa ummidavaar itnaa bhagyavan he ki wo kahin bhi rahe yahaan kaa kaaryakarta apane bheetar khud ko ummidavaar maanata he
 Not to let the BJP flag be bowed at every booth in Kashi, PM Modi said that there are two aspects to this election - one is to win the Kashi Lok Sabha, according to me this work is completed tomorrow
 ek kaam abhi baaki he wo he poling booth jeetna or ek bhi poling booth bijepi kaa jhanda jhukne nahin dena
 We have to break some records in this election as well
 main chahta hum ki loktantr jeetna chahie
 It is to break the record that so far polling has taken place in Banaras, Uttar Pradesh, more than it has been done
 duniya ko dikhaa dena he ki matdaan ke saare record ham tod denge

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator After the new government comes to the center, everyone's attention is again on Kashmir policy
 is baar amit shah grahamantri hai, aise main vipakshi sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 PDP chief and former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti advocated talking to Pakistan on the Kashmir issue and attacked Amit Shah
 ab purv cricketer or bijepi saansad gautam gambhir ne un par palatwaar kiya he
 Gambhir wrote that questioning the mufti like this is ridiculous
 gautam gambhir ne somvaar ko twit kiya, ‘haalanki ham kashmir kii samasya ke samaadhaan kii baat kar rahe hai
 But to call Amit Shah's policy as cruel by Mehbooba Mufti is completely ridiculous
 itihaas hamaare dhairya or dhiraj kaa gavaah rahaa he
 But if my Kashmiri people remain safe through the operation, then it is right '
 While i am all for a talk-based solution to Kashmir problem but for@mehboobamuftito term shri@amitshah’s process as “brute” is “ridiculously naive”
 History has been witness to our patience and endurance
 But if oppression ensures security for my people, then so be it
 - Gautam Gambhir (@gautamgambhir) June 3, 2019 Let us know that Mehbooba Mufti had targeted the central government by tweeting on Monday
 mahabuuba ne twit kar is baat kii apil kii thi ki is masale ke raajnneetik samaadhaan kii jarurat he
 This should include all parties including Pakistan
 iske saath hi unhone amit shah par nishaanaa saadhaa, mufti ne likhaa ki amit shah agar chaah rahe hai ki bal ke prayog ke saath maamla jaldi sulajh jayega, to ye haasyaaspad he
 Since 1947, Kashmir's been looked through the prism of security by successive governments
 It’s a political problem that needs a political redressal by involving all stakeholders inc Pak
 Expecting a quick fix through brute force by newly appointed HM is ridiculously naive — Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti) June 3, 2019 It is noteworthy that Amit Shah, as BJP chief, took an aggressive stance on Section 370, Article 35A during the Lok Sabha elections
 aise main ab jab vah grahamantri hai to ye sabhi mudde unke hi jimme hai
 Because of this, political stir has intensified
 grih mantri kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ke baad amit shah ne pehle jammu-kashmir ke rajyapal se mulaakaat kii or uske baad suraksha agenciyon ke adhikariyon se baat kii
 During this time, Shah formulated a new strategy on Kashmir
 aapako bataa den ki gautam gambhir or mahabuuba mufti ke bich kaaphi lambey samay se twitor par jang chhidati ai he, isse pehle chunaav prachaar yaa phir jab gambhir raajnneeti main nahin aae the tab bhi donon twitor par aamane-saamne aa gaye the
 The roads of Mumbai have become political, these pits are becoming a political arena in the city
 vahiin aam janata ko trephic kii tis se roj rubaru hona pad rahaa he
 The mayor is on the streets now, as the BMC elections are due next year but Mumbaikar is not confident of getting rid of the difficulties

 i have personally tried to ensure that no blacklisted contractor gets a contract
 har saal mumbai main monsoon ke dinon main hazaron gadde nikal aate hai, jisamen sadakon main gadde yaa gaddhon main sadakon kaa fark mushkil ho jaataa he
 BMC is saying that this year about 500 pits received complaints, most of which were repaired, while people say that they are at least 4 times the number
 marammat main istemaal saamagree ghatiya he jisaki vajah se chand dinon main halaat jas ke tas ho jaaenge
 The comments roj pashchimi upnagar main taxi chalaane vaale changez khan kaa kahana he ki yahaan dher saare gadde hai or trephic ke halaat bahut bure hai, gadiyon ko chalane main ghanton lag jate hai
 However, BMC is denying the allegations as false
 standing cameti ke chairman yashodhar phanse ne kaha, 'ham in ahm jankshan ko dekh rahe hai, jahaan logon ko zyada dikkat hoti he
 We are also working on holidays
 pehle mrdie ne in sadakon kaa theka diya tha, lekin wo thekedaar kahin najar nahin aa rahe, lihaaja ham inhen thik kar rahe hai
 ' biemasi kamishnar ne gaddhon kii marammat ke liye 48 ghante kii dedline di thi, lekin halaat bataa rahe hai ki sadak par ye miyaad prashasan ke liye myne nahin rakhti
 Mumbai Mayor Snehal Ambekar has been monitoring the streets of the city for three days, in the name of repairing the road, the Congress has accused the Shiv sena-bjp ruling BMC in corruption of crores, in response to which the mayor says i am Dahisar Went to see the pits, still doing the same thing today, these roads are important and we want to help Mumbaikars
 maine vyaktigat taur par ye sunishchit karne kii koshish kii he ki kisi bluekalysted thekedaar ko theka naa mili
 Thousands of pits come out in Mumbai every year during the monsoon days, in which it becomes difficult to differentiate between pits or pits in the roads
 biemasi kah rahi he is saal lagbhag 500 gaddhon kii shikaayatein usee milin, jisamen zyaadaatar kii marammat ho gai jabaki logon kaa kahana he ki inaki taadaad kam se kam 4 guna he
 The material used in the repair is poor, due to which the situation will prevail in a few days
 tippaniyan Genghis Khan, who drives a taxi in the western suburbs every day, says that there are many pits here and the traffic conditions are very bad, the trains take hours to walk
 haalanki biemasi in aaropon ko galat bataa rahi he
 Standing Committee Chairman Yashodhar Phanse said, "we are looking at these important junctions, where people have more difficulty
" chuttee ke din bhi ham kaam kar rahe hai
 Earlier MMRDA had given the contract for these roads, but those contractors are not seen anywhere, so we are fixing them
 ' The BMC commissioner had given a 48-hour deadline to repair the pits, but circumstances are suggesting that these periods on the road do not matter to the administration

 The politics of Bihar has been warmed by a tweet by Chirag Paswan, the son of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and leader of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP)
 chiraag ne bihar main siton ke bantwaare ko lekar bijepi ko ultimatum diya, jis par raajnneetik bayaanbaji bhi tej ho gai he
 LJP gave ultimatram Ram Vilas Paswan's brother and LJP leader Pashupati Paras gave BJP an ultimatum till 31 December
 unka kahana he ki is taarikh tak bijepi ko bihar main loksabhaa siton par faisla kar lenaa chahie
 He said that in 2014 we were part of the NDA, we wanted to make Narendra Modi the Prime Minister
 ab ham chaahate hai ki hamen 2014 jitani hi saat siten di jaaen
 He said that when there was talk of seat sharing between Amit Shah and Nitish Kumar, we were not discussed
 pashupati paras ne kaha ki amit shah ko endie ke sabhi netaaon ke saath baithak kerani chahie
 NDA is in trouble due to the departure of Jitan Ram Manjhi and Upendra Kushwaha
 bataa den ki ram vilaas paswan ko 'raajnneeti kaa mausam vaigyanik' kaha jaataa he
 In such a situation, if such an ultimatum is given to the BJP by their party, then it can raise the concerns of NDA
 'bistar bandhane kaa samay aa gaya he'rajd netaa manoj jha ne kaha ki unke twit kaa nihitarth ye he ki puraa sindicket sirf dhai logon kaa he

 'nobody likes Modi's style' TDP, which has separated from NDA, has also given a statement on this
 tidipi ke saansad rabindra babu ne kaha ki shivasena ne bhi inako pehle ultimatum diya tha
 No NDA partner is satisfied with them

 He said that gradually everyone will be separated from the NDA
 'dhah rahi he endie kii imaarat'tiemasi netaa sukhendu shekhar bole ki pehle tidipi gai, phir RLSP chali gai
 Now if Paswan's party is going, it means that the NDA building is collapsing
 lekin ham 2019 kaa chunaav muddon par ladenge
 Among these, issues of demonetisation, GST and unemployment will be important
 'ye loktantric vyavastha'rajyasabha saansad rakesh sinha ne chiraag ke twit par kaha ki unhone aisi koi bhaavana nahin dikhaai he jisamen lagata ho ki vah endie ke prati chintaa jaahir kar rahe hon

 To choose from which one was the most gimmick
 sabase zyada 29 fisadi yugers ne vikaas gupta ko nautanki kaha
 After this, Hina and Akash got 27-27 per cent votes and Shilpa got 17 per cent respectively
 Ghar me sabse jyada nautanki kaun hai? # weekendkavaar— COLORS (@colorstv)december 30, 2017bataa den ki vikaas big bos ke set par kai baar rote dekhe gaye hai

 lekin agar aapako pataa chale ki inaki big bos house shaadi ho rahi he, to yakeenan hi aap chaunk jaaenge
 But the show's ex-contestant Bandgi Kalra is pursuing such a wish
 is ek vajah se big bos main sab par baari hai hina, ban sakati hai vinarbig bos ke ek ansin video main vah aisi planning karti najar ai
 His plan also includes Shilpa's brother Ashutosh and Hina's boyfriend Rocky

 That's why Bandgi says Virat kohli-anushka Sharma
 itane main rocky kehete hai, nahin shilpa or vikaas kii shaadi bhi surkhiyon main he
 On hearing this, Shilpa's brother starts laughing
 uttarakhand main in dinon aam janata or prashasan ke bich thani hui he
 Unhappy with the non-construction of the road, the general public started the exercise to build the road themselves
 iske liye logon ne sadak bhi khod daali
 The case is of Uttarkashi
 jahaan gaanv main log khud sadak banane main jute gaye
 In fact, due to the careless attitude of the government, the angry villagers themselves decided to build a road hanging for years
 prashasan or sarkaar se sadak kii maang karne ke baad bhi sadak na banane par ravivaar ko prashasan kii andekhi se majaboor nirakot gaanv ke gramin cooteti devi ke paas mode par pahunche
 Upon reaching here, the villagers worshiped the land themselves and started digging the road
 haathon main kudaal, fawda or ganti liye gramin sadak banane ke liye nikle
 The zeal to build the road and to complete it was clearly seen in the eyes of the villagers
 graminon kaa aarope he ki jila mukhyalay ke paas hone ke baad bhi gaanv main sadak nahin pahunchi he
 Due to this, the local people do not get timely treatment
 jis kaaran gaanv main kai mautein ho chuki hai
 The villagers say that through several demonstrations, processions, the administration was told trouble, but no hearing was held
 sthaneey nivaasiyon ne bataaya ki ab gramin tab tak sadak nirmaan main jute rahenge, jab tak vibhaag kii jesibi sadak khodne ke liye maukey par nahin pahunchati
 Villagers say they staged a sit-in, handed over the memorandum, but neither the administration is listening nor taking any action
 aise main sadak nirmaan kii raah dekhne se to acha he ki khud hi gaanv tak jane kaa rasta bana liya jaae

 bharat ne jab pakistan or china ke khilaaf jang ladaa tha tab aise kai maukey aae the jab hamaare jangi jahaaj raat ke andhere yaa kisi or vajah se naa udaan bhar paa rahe the naa hi jameen par utar paa rahe the
 Not only this, enemy countries were constantly targeting our airbase as well
 magar ab vakt badal chukaa he
 Now what day and night
 kya airbase or kya ranve
 Our war ships are no longer enamored of any runway or airbase to face the enemy
 wo to kisi haive yaa expresve se bhi ud kar dushmano par bam barasaa sakate hai
 This is a representation of Indian power
 ye is baat kii gavahi he ki jab vakt padegaa to hindustan kahin se bhi dushman par aasamaani qahar barapa saktaa he
 This is also proof that the Indian warship will not be a temptation to any runway or airbase to crack down on the enemy
 wo aise kisi haive se bhi ud kar dushman ke thikaanon ko nesto-naabud kar saktaa he
 On the same highway on which the motor vehicles have to run, all the modern warships included in the Indian warship landed and flew
 yah us taiyaari kaa hissaa he jo jang ke halaat main kaam aaenge
 This was the occasion for the inauguration of the agra-lucknow Expressway, but amidst the ceremonies of the inauguration, when six fighter jets of the Indian Air Force touched down on the expressway by tearing through the sky, witness this historic scene
 Thousands of people made up their hearts
 2000 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se udaan bharne vaale airforce ke in donon supersonic jetts kaa ye dam-kham dekh kar har hindustani kaa seenaa garv se chaudaa ho gaya
 Airforce has an old plan to land the fighter plane in an emergency on similar expressways
 aise main jab upi ke 13 hazaar 2 sau karod kii laagat se bane is nae express ve ke udghaatan ke maukey par chah fiter jetts ko utarane kii jagah mili, to maanon ek saath do khwab puure ho gaye
 One dream is to get the express to the common people, while the other air force will get another air strip in UP
 upi sarkaar ne airforce ke saath mil kar is yojana ko amal main laane kii taiyaari kaafii pehle se tay kar rakhi thi
 Then when these fighter jets came down on the misty sky of Bangarmau one by one at the appointed time, everyone was thrilled
 har tarah ullas tha
 According to the plan, on Monday, three Mirage 2000 and three Sukhoi aircraft were to come for the touch down
 lekin jaise hi pehla sukhoi tach dian ke liye neeche aane laga, ek kutta expresve par aa gaya
 In such a situation, the pilot of Sukhoi was immediately warned
 tab is fiter jet ne express ve chune se pehle hi waapas udaan bhar lee
 But after this when about a quarter and a half kilometer of the expressway was re-sanitized, one by one all the six jets touched the expressway and then flew back
 aisa nahin he ki kisi expresve par indian airforce ne koi pehali baar apana dam dikhaaya ho
 Earlier in May last year, the Air Force had launched its French Décor Miraj to Thousand jets on the Yamuna Express near Raya village in Mathura
 lekin ye pehla mauka tha, jab airforce kii khaas takat maane janevaale sukhoi jetts ne bhi kisi expresve par tach dian kiya
 According to experts, in the event of war, often enemy countries target the air strips of the front country, so that fighter jets do not fly for further attacks
 aise main express ve jaisi jagah par fiter jetts ke land karne laayak haalat paidaa karnaa ek ahm vaikalpik vyavastha sabit ho sakati he
 On Monday also, the Air Force carried out this exercise near Bangarmau with the same intention
 aakhir haive jangi jahaajon ke ranve main kaise tabdeel ho jaataa he? kya harhive ranweban saktaa he? to jawaab he aisa nahin ho saktaa
 Because to convert the expressway into a runway, many important things are necessary
 bhartiya vaiu sena ne zyaadaatar unheen expresve ko apane jangi jahaajon ke techoff yaa landing ke liye chunaa he jahaan se pakistan se kareeb hai

 annadramuk netaa jayalalita ne kaha ki unki party ko 2-ji spectrum maamle main sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) jaanch se kam kuch bhi manjuur nahin he
 Jaya claimed that the arrest of former Telecom Minister a Raja shows that those who were supporting him have accepted Raja's mistake
 unhone kaha, in partiyon ne shuru main kaha ki raja doshi nahin hai, lekin ab raja kii giraftaar ke baad unhone unki galati maan lee he
 Raja was arrested by the CBI on Wednesday along with two of his officers
 deshbhar main swatantraaa diwas bade utsaah ke saath manaaya ja rahaa he
 Sonia Gandhi, who became the interim president of the Congress Party, also hoisted the tricolor at the Congress headquarters along with party workers today
 vahiin swatantraaa diwas ke is avasar par sonia gandhi ne kaha ki ek loktantric bharat main kattarta or ashishnutaa ke liye koi jagah nahin he, phir bhi hamaare desh main har din lakhon logon ko bhedbhaav kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Congratulating India on its 73rd Independence Day, he said in a statement, 'currently India has moved rapidly in all fields, but at the core of our principles are truth, non-violence, compassion and unwavering patriotism
 'unhone aage bataaya ki, '73 saal ke baad bhi loktantric or lacheele bharat main kattarta, andhvishwaas, sampradayawad, ashishnutaa yaa anyaay ke liye koi jagah nahin he, phir bhi lakhon naagarik har din bhedbhaav kaa saamana karte hai
 To truly nurture our freedom, we need to raise our voice against everything emerging as a nation, which stems from injustice, intolerance and discrimination
 'vahiin baadh prabhavit kerala main apane sansadeey kshetra vynad kaa daura karne gaye purv congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi dhwajarohan kaarykram main bhaag lene ke liye rashtriya rajdhani waapas laut aae
 Apart from the Gandhi family, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and senior Congress leaders of the party Ghulam Nabi Azad, Motilal Vora, Ahmed Patel, K
 si
 Venugopal and several other party leaders were present in office during this period
 sonia gandhi ne apane bayaan main nagarikon se aagrah kiya ki ve swatantraaa, bhaichaare, shanti or samanta ke mulyon kii raksha or sangrakshan ke mahaan kartavya kaa paalan karen
 He said, 'our freedom is the result of the sacrifices of those who sacrificed their lives for the present India
 'sonia gandhi ne swatantraaa diwas par sainikon kii prashansa karte hue kaha, 'hamen bharat kii akhandta kii raksha main apane sashastr balon ke sarvocch balidaan ko nahin bhoolanaa chahie
 ' loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle charan kii voting ke baad ab duusare charan ke liye raajnneetik dalon ne prachaar abhiyaan tej kar diya he
 In the second phase, 8 Lok Sabha seats of Uttar Pradesh will be voted on 18 April
 pehle charan kii tarah duusare charan main bhi basapa-sapa-areldi kii aguwai hathi kar rahaa he
 Of the eight, the BSP is in the fray for 6 seats and the SP-RLD is contesting one seat each
 is tarah se mayawati banaam narendra modi ke bich chunavi muqabla he
 However, at the same time, the reputation of Congress state president Raj Babbar and bjp's Hema Malini is also at stake
 upi ke duusare charan main nagina, bulandshahr, agra or hathras surakshit seat he
 Apart from this, Amroha, Aligarh, Mathura and Fatehpur Sikri seats are included
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main in sabhi aath siton ko bijepi jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BSP is contesting on Nagina, Amroha, Bulandshahar, Aligarh, Agra and Fatehpur Sikri seats
 jabaki hathras seat par sapa or mathura seat par areldi chunaav lard rahi he
 Nagina Lok Sabha seat of Muslim Kingmaker Bijnaur district is reserved for scheduled castes in Nagina
 gathbandhan main yah seat basapa ke khate main gai he
 From here, the BSP has fielded Girish Chandra, BJP, sitting MP Yashwant Singh and Congress Omwati, wife of former IAS RK Singh
 nagina seat par gathbandhan or congress donon kii najar dalit or muslim voton par he
 Whereas BJP wants to win again with the help of Rajput and non-jatav Dalit as well as Jat voters
 lekin, 6 lakh muslim voter is seat par kingmekar kii bhoomika main hai
 Fatehpur Sikri: The fate of Raj Babbar seems to be a triangular contest in Parftehpur Sikri Lok Sabha seat
 yahaan se bijepi ne apane maujuuda saansad babulal choudhary kaa tikat katkar rajkumaar chaher ko utaara he
 While state president Rajabbar from Congress and Guddu Pandit from BSP are in the fray
 is seat par do lakh jat matadaataaon ke dekhte hue bijepi ne jat samudaay par daanv khelaa he
 While the BSP has played the Brahmin card after taking into consideration three lakh Brahmin votes
 aise main congress ke rajbbar ke saamne sabaki badi chunauti jaateey sameekaran ko todna he
 Amroha: BSP versus BSP from Amroha Lok Sabha seat, BJP has fielded Kunwar Danish from JDS
 vahiin, bijepi ne apane maujuuda saansad kanvar singh tanvar par daanv lagaaya to congress ne sachin choudhary par daanv khelaa he
 Looking at the caste equation of Amroha seat, about 5 lakh Muslims, 2
 5 lakh dalit, 1 lakh gurjar, 1 lakh kashyap, 1
 There are 5 lakh Jats and 95 thousand Lodh voters
 basapa pratyaashee muslim, dalit or jat ke sahare sansad pahunchnaa chaahate hai
 While Tanwar Gurjar, Kashyap, Lodh and Jat want to obstruct the coalition's path by bringing voters along with the Dalits into their fold
 bulandshahr: do daliton kii ladibulandshahr seat par basapa ne yogesh verma, bijepi ne apane maujuuda saansad bholaa singh or congress ne bansi singh pahadiya par daanv khelaa he
 About 1 in Bulandshahr seat
 5 lakh brahman, 1 lakh rajput, 1 lakh yadav, 1 lakh jat, 3
 5 lakh Dalits, 2
 5 lakh muslim or 2 lakh lodh matadaata hai
 In 2014, BJP won by four votes
 is baar mahagathbandhan se utre yogesh verma dalit, muslim, yadav or jat maton ke sahare sansad pahunchane kii jugat main hai
 But Bhola Singh Lodh, Brahmin and Rajput of BJP are hoping to win once again with the help of Rajput votes
 mathura: hema malini ke liye chunautimathura loksabhaa seat se bijepi ne ek baar phir hema malini ko utaara he
 While Kunwar Narendra Singh from RLD and Mahesh Pathak from Congress are in the fray
 yahaan kareeb 4 lakh jat samudaay ke matadaata hai
 While 2
 5 lakh brahman or 2
 There are also 5 lakh Rajput voters
 itane hi dalit matadaata hai or dhed lakh ke kareeb muslim hai
 In such a situation, if the RLD candidates manage to help the Rajputs as well as Jat Muslims and Dalits, then for the BJP, winning this seat will be like chewing iron gram
 aligarh main trikoniya muqablligarh loksabhaa seat se bijepi ne maujuuda saansad satish gautam or congress ne choudhary bijendra singh ko maidan main utaara he
 At the same time, BSP has fielded Ajit Balyan
 jaateey sameekaran ke lihaaj se dekhen to yadav, brahman, rajput or jat ke kareeb dedh-dedh lakh vot hai
 Whereas Dalits are around 3 lakh and 2 lakh Muslim voters
 ise votbank kii najar se denkhe to basapa or congress donon ne jat ummidavaar utaare hai to bijepi ne brahman par daanv khelaa he
 Hathras SP vs BJP: The Lok Sabha seat of SP has fielded former Union Minister Ramjilal Suman
 vahiin, bijepi ne rajvir singh balmiki or congress ne trilokiram divakar ko maidan main utaara he
 However, this seat is considered to be Jat dominated
 is seat par kareeb 3 lakh jat, 2 lakh brahman, 1
 5 lakh Rajputs, 3 lakh Dalits, 1
 5 lakh baghel or 1
 There are 25 lakh Muslim voters
 aise main agar sapa jat, muslim or dalit ko ekajute karne main kaamyaab rahati he to bijepi ke liye lohe ke chane chabane pad sakate hai
 Agra: On the Jangagara reserved seat between the BJP-BSP, the BSP has fielded Manoj Soni, BJP SP SP Baghel and the Congress has fielded Preeta Harit
 bijepi ke espi baghel sapa or basapa main rah chuke hai, aise main muslim matadaataaon main acchhee khaasi pakad maani jaati he
 In this way, along with BJP, Baghel is able to manage the vote bank of other parties, then once again the lotus can blossom
 lekin congress pradesh adhyaksh raaj babbar bhi is seat kaa pratinidhitiv kar chuke hai
 In such a situation, they too have their own base
 jabaki dalit or muslim ke sahare basapa bhi jeet kii aas lagaae hue he
 Delhi's left-arm fast bowler Pradeep Sangwan received an email from the BCCI on his birthday confirming that he had been removed from the doping case 18 months ago and that he could practice with the Delhi team
 sangwan ne kaha, '5 november ko meraa 24waan janmdin tha or usase ek din pehle hi mujhe bisisiai se email mila

 Sangwan, who played for Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 6, was the first professional cricketer from India to be banned in the doping case

 After that he was working on rehabilitation
 'inputah bhashaa se Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Parliamentary Party President LK Advani demanded Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's dismissal of Minister of State for External Affairs Shashi Tharoor in the wake of the controversy over the Kochi IPL team
 adwani ne ek kaarykram main apane sambodhan main kaha, ‘pradhanmantri ko videsh rajyamantri shashi tharur ko mantrimandal se baahar karnaa chahie kyonki apane pad kaa anuchit phayda uthaaya he
 He said that there should be an inquiry into whether Tharoor misused his position for financial gain for himself or any other person

 Senior leaders LK Advani and Prakash Karat also demanded the removal of Tharoor from the post today
 adwani ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ko nishchit taur par tharur ko mantriparishad se hataa dena chahie kyonki unhone apane pad kii garima ke thik vipareet aacharan kiya he
 He said, 'there is a need to investigate whether Tharoor is guilty of misusing the post to get financial benefit for himself and any other person?' CPI (M) General Secretary Prakash Karat said, "I am convinced that the Congress party and the government will accept that whatever happened is absolutely untested and it would be better if Tharoor resigns without any delay

 King, sharing the photo, explained why she wore such a bright dress at that event
 unhone likhaa, ''apni almaari kii safai karte hue maine is goun ko dekha or un ladakiyon ko yaad kiya jinhone mujhe ek patr bheja tha, jisamen likhaa tha ki mujhe nasa main baatcheet ke dauraan kuch chamakdaar pahananaa chahie, taaki ve yakeen kar saken ki vaigyanik bhi kuch chamakdaar pahan sakate hai
 This tweet from Rita J
 King received overwhelming support from users
 unke is twit ko ab tak 41 hajaar se zyada likes mil chuke hai
 Many users thanked him for the fact that science happens for everyone, even for girls who like to wear bright clothes
 iske saath hi kuch logon ne unki is baat ke liye bhi tarif kii ki unhone purushon ke varchasv vaale kshetra main apni pahchaan banaai
 This is so important
 The idea that masculine is serious and feminine is frivolous limits the options girls see for themselves and their future lives
 This shows them that they don't have to pick between their interests and their identities
 Science is for everyone
 Thank you! That is absolutely cool
 i try to get my 7 year old granddaughter into science
 I've been trying to explain that in case being a princess doesn't work out she needs a career backup plan
 But when she's performing a space walk she'll still be my princess
 YESSS! This is why i hate the anti-pink backlash prevalent among so many mom spaces
 There's nothing wrong with being girly, and it shouldn't preclude you from working in male-dominated areas! https: / / t

 abram is still awake and playing with them xxrep 5 ! Prime Minister Narendra Modi fiercely targeted the Congress in a public meeting in Kaushambi district, adjacent to Prayagraj in UP
 piem ne kumbh kaa udhaaharan dene ke dauraan purv pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru ko bhi lapete main le liya
 PM Modi said that when Pandit Nehru came to the Kumbh Mela, thousands of people died in the stampede due to the chaos
 congress ne is khabar ko dabaa diya
 The PM said that during the Congress government in 1954 when Pandit Nehru came to the Kumbh Mela when he was the Prime Minister, thousands of people were crushed to death due to the stampede due to the chaos, but neither the then media showed this news prominently nor Only the relatives of the dead received any compensation
 ek-do akhabaaron main ye khabar kone main khaper chhapi, use bhi dabaa diya gaya
 Families who lost loved ones were suppressed
 us samay panchayat se parliament tak congress kii hi sarkaar thi
 This sin occurred during the Congress Prime Minister
 piem modi ne congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki pichley paanch saal se main sirf yahi mantra lekar kaam karata rahaa ki 55 saal main jis parivaar ne desh ko barbaad kiya, use mujhe 55 maheene main thik karnaa he
 i am working continuously with this sentiment
 is samay unke paas koi bhi pradhanmantri pad ke yogya netaa nahin he

 jo 40 seat lard rahe hai vah bhi pradhanmantri bananaa chaahate hai
 The PM said that he knows that to become the leader of the opposition, more than 50 seats are required
 piem ne kaha ki is chunaav kii visheshta he ki desh par adhiktar samay tak raaj karne vaali party congress pehali baar itani kam siton ke saath chunaav lard rahi he
 PM Modi said, tell me that you can trust as many faces as you can to become Prime Minister, he questioned that those who cannot kill SP and BSP village goons, can they cure terrorists? Huh? He said that even today there is a threat of terrorism in the world
 pehle baar-baar bam dhamaake hote the
 PM Modi claimed that when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister, he once visited the Kumbh Mela
 tab panchayat se parliament tak congress kii sarkaar thi
 Then there was a stampede in Kumbh due to the chaos, thousands of people were killed, but this news was suppressed for Pandit Nehru not to be stained
 us samay kii media ne bhi un khabaron ko dikhaane kii himmat nahin jutai thi
 Modi said that i had great respect for the people who cleaned in Kumbh
 un logon ne kumbh main safai ke prati logon kii soch badal di
 The virtue i have got by washing the feet of these cleansing brothers and sisters is my greatest capital
 unhone kaha ki jab sarkaar badalati he, niyat badalati he tab kaisaa parinaam aata he, yah prayagraj ke kumbh meley ne is baar dikhaa diya
 Earlier, there were reports of battles between the Akharas at Kumbh Mela

 Kunal Ghosh blamed the Sarada chit fund scam on BJP leader Mukul Rai (then in TMC) and 12 others
 mukul raay kabhi mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke khasmkhas hua karte the, lekin ab bijepi main hai
 Let us tell you that the Supreme Court in its order on Tuesday ordered Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar to appear before the CBI and cooperate in the investigation

 In the Saifai festival under Mulayam and Akhilesh Raj, the money of the general public was spent and now the expenditure in Gorakhpur festival in Yogi Raj continues
 haalanki donon mahotsav ke aayojan main kaaphi antar he
 The festival starts in Gorakhpur, the constituency of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, from this year, while the Saifai festival started in 1997 and is celebrated every year in December

 On the claim of Yogi spending 33 lakh in the festival in the area, SP leader Azam Khan has questioned whether the kind of event being organized can be possible in such a small amount of money
 haalanki khabar aa rahi he ki shashan ne kaarykram ko bhavy tareeke se karaane ke liye or ek karod rupye aavantit kar die hai

 Although there is no account of Jung Saheb in this, but even when the war of power in Delhi was getting worse than the worst, then we thought what is the problem
 kisi ne kaha bhala jang ke rahete shanti kaise ho sakati he par yah behad chhichhli tukbandi thi isliye hamane is par dhyaan nahin diya
 Najeeb Jung enrolled in London School of Economics after studying from Delhi University
 apane purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh samet kai nobel puraskaar vijeta yaheen se padhe hai
 After this Jung did a lot of work in the field of energy
 ambani parivaar ke saath bhi inaki khub chhanati he
 After becoming the Governor, he made helmets mandatory for women in Delhi as well
 haalanki sikh mahilaon ko isse alag rakhaa
 People also turned their eyes on this decision, but Jung Saheb Azad is the owner of health

 Then Friend, who was a student of Jamia, told the story of Jung Saheb that when he was the Vice Chancellor of Jamia, he played Mughal Emperor Akbar in a play
