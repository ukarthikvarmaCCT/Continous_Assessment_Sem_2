 sarkaar ek upabhokta ko saal main adhiktam 12 silendaron par sabsidi detii he
 What is the reason for the fall? The main reason for the reduction in LPG prices is the reduction of tax on this fuel
 iske alaava antarrashtriya bazaar main isaki keemat ghatana or america dollar ke mukaable rupee kii sthiti main sudhaar kii vajah se bhi isaki keemton par asar padaa he

 Relief before the budget: The price cut of LPG has come at a time when there are few hours left for presenting the country's interim budget

 There are chances of making many big announcements for the common people in this budget before the Lok Sabha elections

 Part time budget is offered in this
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha, 'tiemasi ke gundon ne mujhapar hamalaa karne kii koshish kii
 Mamta Banerjee (chief Minister of West Bengal) tried to incite violence, but i am safe
 ' shah ne kaha ki jhadap ke dauraan police mookadarshak bani rahi
 He said that the police had told him that the permission for the roadshow ends with the college and that he would be taken to the ancestral house of the Bidhan Sarani of Swami Vivekananda
 shah ne daawa kiya, 've (police) niojit maarg se hat gaye or us raste par le gaye jahaan trephic jam tha
 i was not allowed to go to Vivekananda's residence to pay tribute and i am saddened by it

 He said at the rally in Behala of the city, 'if you take your hand to Vidyasagar, what will i tell you besides the goons
 ' unhone kaha, 'mujhe aapaki vichaardhaara se ghrinaa he, mujhe aapke tareekon se nafrat he
 He also announced a protest rally on Thursday against the demolition of Vidyasagar's bust
 mamata ne kaha ki kya amit shah bhagwaan se upar hai ki unke khilaaf koi pradarshan nahin kar saktaa
 Meanwhile, the BJP on Tuesday requested the Election Commission to stop West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee from campaigning in the state, alleging that the 'constitutional machinery' has collapsed there
 kolkata main bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ke road sho ke dauraan hinsa or aagjanee kii ghatana ke baad kendriya mantri nirmala sitaraman or mukhtaar abbaas nakvi sahit party kaa ek pratinidhimandal chunaav ayog pahunchaa or rajya main swatantra evam nishpaksh chunaav sunishchit karne ke liye tatkaal hastkshep karne kii maang kii
 Naqvi accused Mamata Banerjee of being a 'participant' in the violence for allegedly targeting the BJP and claimed that she 'incited' her Trinamool Congress workers to attack the BJP workers
 isse pehle yah tanaav tab bad gaya tha jab amit shah ke kafile ke college street or swami vivekanand ke nivas ke liye uttari kolkata main bidhan sarini se guzarate vakt patharav kiya gaya
 The clashes started outside the Calcutta University campus on College Street when a group started shouting slogans against Shah, officials said
 'prince of kolkata', 'dada' ke naam se mashhoor team india ke purv captain saurav ganguli 42waan janm din manaa rahe hai
 The credit for bringing migration to Indian cricket goes to Dada
 cricket kaa makka kahe jane vaale lords ground par test kii donon pariyon main centuri ke saath dada ne apane damdaar international cricket kariyar kaa aagaaj kiya tha
 Ganguly, who captained Team India between 2000 and 2005, played 49 Test matches, of which he faced 21 wins and 13 defeats, while 15 matches were drawn
 dada kii aguwai main 1999 se 2005 ke bich bharat ne 146 vanade maichon main 76 jite or 65 ganvaae, jabaki 5 maichon ke nattejey nahin aae
 Currently, Ganguly is becoming very popular for his cricket commentary
 maidan par chakke-chaukon se lubhaane vaale dada cricket camentry ke jariye apni baton se shandaar 'shots' lagaate hai
 Ganguly, who started his international career with the Lord's Test in 10 Records-1-1996, was the third batsman in the world at that time to score a century in both innings of the debut test
 2-saurav ganguli apni captaini main team india ko 20 se zyada test maichon main jeet dilaane vaale pehle captain hai
 Under his captaincy, India won 21 Tests
 isse pehle mohammad ajaharuddin kii captaini main bharat ne 14 test match jite the
 His record was broken by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, former captain of Team India
 dhoni kii captaini main team ne 27 test match jite
 3-ganguly is third in terms of completing the fastest 6000 runs in ODI cricket
 is list main sabase upar team india test captain or vanade upakptain viraat kohli hai
 Virat Kohli did this feat in 136 innings
 uske baad vivian richards kaa number aata he jinhone 141 pariyon main 6000 kaa aankada chuaa
 Ganguly completed 6000 runs in 147 odis
 4-ganguli ne vanade cricket main sabase tej 8000 or 9000 ran puure kiye
 Ganguly's name was also the fastest 7000 runs record, which was broken by South African captain AB de Villiers in 2014
 divilliars ne 166 pariyon main 7000 ran puure kiye jabaki dada ne 174 pariyon main yah aankada chuaa tha
 To reach 8000 runs, Ganguly played 228 ODI innings to reach 200 and 9000 runs
 5-vanade cricket main saurav ganguli or sachin tendulkar ke naam sabase zyada ranon kii saajhedaari karne kaa world record darj he
 Both of them have shared 8227 runs in 176 odis
 is dauraan donon ke bich 26 shatkeey or 29 ardhashtakeey saajhedaariyaan hui
 It is very difficult to break this world record at the moment
 6- saurav ganguli or rahul dravid ke naam vanade kii teesri sabase badi saajhedaari kaa record darj he
 Both shared a 318-run partnership for the second wicket
 unase upar kris gail-marlon sampuls (372 ran) or sachin tendulkar-rahul dravid (331 ran) hi hai
 7 - Dada is second in terms of maximum century out of home ground
 unhone bharat se baahar 18 centuri jadi hai
 In this case, only Sachin Tendulkar is above him
 tendulkar ne bharat ke baahar 29 centuri jadi hai
 Dada is at number six in the list of the most sixes in 8-ODI cricket
 shahid afridi (351), sanath jayasoorya (270), kris gail (238), sachin tendulkar (195), brendan maikalam (190) ke baad saurav ganguli 190 chhakkon ke saath chathe number par hai
 On the other hand, if you talk about Indian batsmen, then they are second after Tendulkar and above Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 9-vanade main sabase zyada main of da match rahane ke maamle main saurav ganguli sachin tendulkar ke baad duusare bhartiya cricketer hai
 Sachin Tendulkar has been named Man of the Match 62 times while Ganguly has been voted Man of the Match 31 times
 10-ek calendar year main sabase zyada ranon ke maamle main bhi ganguli duusare number par hai
 Sachin Tendulkar is just above him
 tendulkar ne 1998 calendar year main 1894 ran banaae to vahiin ganguli ne 1999 calendar year main 1767 ran banaae
 Rahul Dravid (1999) at number three is present with 1761 runs
 sansad kaa monsoon satr 18 july se shuru ho rahaa he
 Meanwhile, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has again raised the demand for women's reservation
 unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chitthee likhakar isaki maang kii he
 It is believed that in response to the triple divorce of the Modi government, Rahul Gandhi has played the role of female observation
 rahul gandhi ne piem modi se kaha he ki vah sansad main mahila aarakshan bill laaen, congress unka puraa samarthan karegi
 The Congress is going to issue a press conference in this regard
 isse pehle 20 sitambar 2017 kopurv congress adhyakshasonia gandhi ne bhi pradhanmantri modi ko patr likhakar loksabhaa main mahila aarakshan bill ko paas karne kaa nivedan kiya tha
 Last year, the Congress submitted 33 lakh signatures in support of 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament and Assembly from different states of the country during the winter session
 badi badi kaagaj kii petiyaan lekar desh ke alag-alag pradeshon se mahila congress kii kaaryakartaaon or netaa dilli pahunchin thim
 Officials and members of the Mahila Congress claimed to have submitted 33 lakh signatures
 ise bhi padhein- ab mahila aarakshan par raashtrapati ke dar jaaegi mahila congressbta den ki varsh 2010 main mahila aarakshan vidheyak ko rajyasabha main paas karaayaa gaya tha
 But this bill could not be passed in the Lok Sabha
 vidheyak ke tahat sansad or rajya vidhaan sabhaaon main mahilaon ko 33 pratishat aarakshan dene kaa prastaav he
 The constitution has to be amended for women's reservation
 samvidhan main sansad or vidhansabha main mahila aarakshan ko lekar koi vyavastha nahin he
 Through the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution in 1993, one-third seats in panchayats and municipal bodies were reserved for women
 yaad rahe ki mahila aarakshan vidheyak sa After meeting Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, Aamir Khan has come in support of Zira Wasim, a trolled riot girl on social media
 unhone kaha he ki jaayra sirf 16 saal kii hai, is baat ko samajhen, unhen akelaa chhod den
 Please tell that Zaira is of Kashmiri origin
 pichley dinon unhone mufti se mulaakaat kii thi
 After this, some people trolled on social media
 iske baad somvaar ko jaayra ne maafee namaa likhaa tha
 After many Bollywood personalities, now Aamir Khan has also come in his support
 dekhen unhone kya twit kiya -pic

 What did Dangal Girl write on Facebook? Zaira wrote on Facebook on Monday - this is an open apology
 main jaanati hum ki bahut se logon ko meri haal kii gatividhiyon se naaraaz hai
 Many people are angry at the meeting of some people
 main unase maafee maangati hum
 i want to say that i understand what happened in the last 6 months
 logon ko yaad hoga ki main sirf 16 saal kii hum
 i think you will understand me that way
 maine jo kiya uske liye maafee maangati hum, magar ye maine jaanboojhkar nahin kiya
 Dangal girl Zaira's post went viral on meeting Mehbooba Mufti, Mafijaira said - i am not a role model
 Zaira has written further - i will be insulted to understand her as a role model and her insult will be insulting us all
 main yahaan koi bahes nahin shuru karnaa chaahati, main bas apni taraf se kuch kahana chaahati thi
 Allah bless you and warn us
 anupam kher ne kiya jaayra ko saport, bataaya role modeljaira ne kyon maangi thi maafikuch dinon pehle jaayra ne mahabuuba mufti se mulaakaat kii thi
 Since then, some people were trolling him on social media
 kuch algaavvaadi unke khilaaf soshal media par post kar rahe the
 It is believed that Zaira was angry with this
 bataa den ki jaayra mul rup se kashmiri hai
 Know how much riot earnings have become 
 
 jaayra kii safai- mujh par kisi kaa dabaav nahimedia main post viral hone ke badadangalgirl ne phir ek post kiya
 He claimed that no one had pressured him to post a meeting for cleaning
 kaha- main samaj nahin paa rahi he ki ye neshnal news kaise ban gai
 Neither i was pressurized nor was i against anyone
 ummid he ki is post se sabakuch band ho jayega
 Dangal created history at the box office
 
 
 raashtra kii smriti main darj vah gumbad ek baar phir raajnneeti ke akhaade main ubhar aayaa he
 This dome was demolished under the pressure of faith in anger, intensified by the suffering God, when something very sacred was also destroyed, that was the ideal of secularism of the Republic
 ghor avishvaas ke saath ek raashtra ne raajnneeti ko apane sabase badtar rup main dekha tha
 The demolition site of an invader was a symbol of justice - a symbol of the triumph of fiery Hindutvaism for the movement that was seeking its legitimacy because of an archaeological site of history or through holes of myth
 lekin chautarafa ghire ek samudaay ke liye yah us bhay kii pushti thi ki bahusankhyak jo daman karte hai use takat nafrat kii bhaavana se milti he
 The second fear is the fear of this community
 ayodhya ek aisa vivaad he jo vot bank kii raajnneeti ke shorwe main varshon tak pakaai jaati rahi or usne nae bharat main nehruwadi sapane ko, aadhuniktaa ke pratikon ko buree tarah dhwast kiya, jo dharmik sahishnutaa or vigyaan sammat maansikta ke mail se ubhare the
 This created an ideological turmoil in Indian politics, as we saw that the God who was liberated in Ayodhya reached the polling booths after a few years and the right wing became a garden
 or ham hairaan ho gaye ki yah congress kii karatuut kaa fal to nahin
 Looking back, it would seem that this was not the case though special chemicals suddenly flowed in the mind of the Hindu nationalist
 ek samay aisa laga ki maha-rathi, tathakthith chhadam dharmanirpekshata ko chunauti dene vaale laalkrishna adwani bhagava ubhaar kaa puraa phayda uthaaenge
 There can be no denying that Ayodhya or the resultant upheaval brought the BJP to power
 phir bhi, hindutv ke alexander dubchek (checkoslovakia ke netaa jinhone check communist party main sudhaar laane kii koshish kii thi) maane jane vaale atal bihari vaajapeyi ke pradhanmantritv main sattashin hui bhaajapa ne ayodhya ko dakshinpanth kaa pavitra sthal nahin banaaya yaa nahin bana saki
 Ayodhya was present as a slogan of desperation (whenever in doubt, take Rama's name) or as an ideological alternative
 satta ke saath bhaajapa kaa mail jab bhartiya raajnneeti kaa sabase chota romance sabit hua tab patan kisi vichaardhaaratmak kamajori ke kaaran nahin hua tha
 In 2004, the BJP did all the work because of the slogan of a slogan and because the Indian right could not understand the hopes and aspirations of 21st century India
 or lambey safar ke yatri ek baar biabaan main pahunch gaye to unhone rasta hi badal liya, myth kii ore jane vaale parichit raste ko chhod unhone itihaas ke kathin path ko chun liya
 From the Ram temple, he made a long jump to the tomb of Jinnah
 yah hindutv ke mul acshan hero kaa sabase dussahasik parivartan tha, ek vidhvansak saidhantik chalaang
 Ultimately, it was nothing more than a personal visit that did not add to the doctrinal image of the party or its leader
 bharat ko jimmedaar dakshinpanth se alag tarah ke saahas kii ummid he
 If the politics of exploiting the past is the prerogative of the extremist group, it is better; And if any eccentric Mahant becomes a pioneer and philosopher - or an analyst of the flaws of our civilization - it is not good
 paraajay bhav se abhi bhi grast party ke liye ayodhya beshak ek bada aakarshan ho saktaa he, or jab vartmaan abujh dikhataa ho or koi manzil na dikhti ho to ateet kii ore dekhne kaa lobh sanvaran karnaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 The truth is that many floors are there for him, and India itself has moved far beyond the rubble of that dome
 bhaajapa ko karnaa sirf yah he ki tark kii sharten badal de
 History is witness that Dakshinpanth has often lost cultural war and won economic battle
 bharat main usne is parampara ko palatate hue, saanskrithik yuddh jitate hue satta hasil kii thi
 Today, he is in danger of losing on both fronts
 aarthik yuddh haarane kaa matlab khud ko ek aise samay main nirarthak bana daalana he jab dakshinpanth ke, chaahe vah satta main ho yaa nahin, liye sabase badi raajnneetik ladaaiyaan bazaar ke morche par ladani hai
 Economy, administration, and society — these are three things that test the imagination of a politician who reads the rudiments of time well
 baharhaal, ye jumale utane hi puraane hai jitani puraani raajnneeti he
 And in India, the weariness of these jumlas is evident whenever and when they are repeated
 kisi bhi raashtra ke jivan main ek aisa bhi samay aata he jab rachanaatmakataa kaa visphot ramnik sukhad katha ko tahasanhas kar detaa he, jab vah sab bhi kaaphi krantikari lagane lagata he jinhen baar-baar doharaaya ja chukaa he
 This has not happened in India yet, and it is like missing an opportunity for both the right and the Congress
 congress ke vaaste khaskar isaki bhavishya kii aawaaj ke liye
 Right wing gets excited only when the gruesome phantoms of nationalism start coming out of the grip of history
 unke aakarshan se bachane ke liye kaaphi saahas kii jarurat padati he, kyonki ayodhya ke baad ke bharat main bharat dakshinpanth ko saidhantik taur par vyast rakhane ke kaaphi maukey uplabdh kara saktaa he
 The Congress also needs to show some restraint
 aakhir, uski chhavi ek aisi party kii he jo band maansikta vaali dharmanirpekshata ke sarkari parade kii aad main hone vaali pratiyogi sampradayikta par falti-phoolati he
 Ultimately, the whole issue rests on the mismatch of India and its politics
 pratigaami raajnneeti kii shabdaawalee us bharat kii bhashaa se mail nahin khaati, jo kisi vivaadaaspad ateet kii giraft main funsane se inkaar karata he
 He is waiting for different kinds of destroyers - those who free our politics from the hypnosis of the great past and make it stand up to the reality of the present
 raajnneeti itihaas ke saath bahes main shaayad hi kabhi jeet paati he, yahi vajah he ki raajnneeti ke chatur khilaadi apni baaten vartmaan ke sandarbh main hi karte hai
 Of course the army and police are breathing a sigh of relief after the death of Burhan Wani, who has become the face of terror in Kashmir, but those who know Kashmir say that its results can prove to be very dangerous
 maatr 14 saal kii umr main hijbul mujahidin jaise aatanki sanghathan main shaamil hone vaale burhan kii tulana log mare hue hathi se kar rahe hai jiske bare main kaha jaataa he ki agar jinda hathi kii keemat lakh rupee he to mare hue kii sava lakh
 That is, many people feel that it may not happen that Burhan's death will push Kashmir into a new phase of terror
 dakshin kashmir main hijbul mujahidin ko phir se jinda karne vaala burhan saat saal se aatanki gatividhiyon main sakriy tha
 On its death, former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has tweeted and raised some questions on its death
 unke mutabik, jinda rahete hue jo burhan soshal media ke jariye jo kuch kar saktaa tha wo maut ke baad or zyada khatarnaak sabit hoga

 Burhan, a resident of Tral in Pulwama, had a reward of Rs 10 lakh
 burhan kaa bhai khalid vaani pichley varsh muthbhed main maaraa gaya tha
 Although security forces had removed many photos of Burhan on social networking sites, but this did not reduce his popularity
 aapako ye bhi bataa den ki dar he ki jis tarah se makabool bhatta or afjal guru ke maare jane ke baad kashmir main aatankwaad ne nai karavat lee, kahin burhan ke baad bhi aisa naa ho
 This fear is haunting everyone, which is not easy to deal with, as soon as the news spread that Hizbul's poster boy terrorist Commander Burhan has been killed, the entire Kashmir was burnt and more than ten people were killed by this violence

 After this, Digvijay Singh in his tweet called the Pulwama terror attack an 'accident', then BJP leaders pulled him up
 khud piem modi ne ek raily main is par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 However, after this Digvijay Singh said that there was no doubt that this was a terrorist attack
 kuch din pehle digvijay singh ne royatres ke khabar ko twit karte hue likhaa, 'bharat ne jis jagah par karrwai kii vahaan abhi bhi madrase chal rahe hai

 He released the list of 25 candidates on Tuesday, moving away from the BJP line
 rajbhar ne upi kii kai ahm siton ke liye ummidavaaron ke naam kaa elaan kiya
 It also has candidates from Banaras, Lucknow and Gorakhpur
 bijepi ne unase ek seat chhodane kaa ofer diya tha or kaha tha ki mantri pad chhod kar ve khud chunaav laden
 In fact, Rajbhar wanted a candidature for his son on the symbol of his party Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (subhaspa), but this could not happen
 bijepi ne rajbhar kii naaraazgi dur karne kii kaaphi koshish kii
 a meeting with Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi was also held but was unsuccessful
 ant main rajbhar ne bijepi ko chunauti dete hue apane 25 ummidavaaron kaa elaan kar diya
 Om Prakash Rajbhar told 'aaj Tak' that he was repeatedly insulted and wanted to contest elections with BJP but BJP did not listen
 bijepi ek bhi seat dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 Rajbhar said that BJP says that there is agreement in the assembly and not in the Lok Sabha
 hamase bolaa gaya ki ek seat par tikat denge lekin bijepi ke simbel par lado
 Could this happen? The SP, BSP, Congress and BJP did not give tickets to the backward
 kisi ne sammaan nahin diya
 Do these people want to remain a peon? Subhaspa president Om Prakash Rajbhar said that he has not yet decided to leave the government but will leave if he says now

 There is no scope for reconciliation now

 You will know how the result will be on the 23rd
 isse pehle bhi rajbhar bijepi ke khilaaf morcha kholte rahe hai
 In January, Rajbhar had said that he considered Congress President Rahul Gandhi to be the Prime Minister
 suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke pramukh ne baliya main patrakaron se kaha tha ki main rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri banane ke kaabil paata hum
 The final decision is in the hands of the people and they will decide who will be the next Prime Minister of India

 On CM Adityanath's statement that if given a chance, he will resolve the Ram temple issue in 24 hours, Rajbhar said in response to the question that if BJP really had such a capacity, then the rule of the country Why did it not do so in the last five years
 pichley saal disambar main unhone kaha tha ki "yadi sudhaar nahin laayaa gaya to uttar pradesh main 80 siten hai, jisamen das siten laana bhi bijepi ke liye baari hongi
 We had repeatedly warned BJP that arrogance is not right
 unke is gurur ko 5 rajyon kii janata ne tod diya he

 Tell tuition fees 12 lakhs and hostel fees 21 lakhs? Who can stop this loot and which governments are responsible for this loot? So stay citizens, do not make yourself lustful by becoming a supporter of this party, that party
 sochie ye doctor daaku nahin banenge to kya banenge

 The truth was revealed to the people

 At the same time, 30-year-old Naveen has a shoe family business

 It was said from the Indian government that in the event of an attack from the terrorists, the security forces will be able to retaliate
 centre sarkaar ne rajya sarkaar kii maang par jammu-kashmir main sashart sijafire kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 However, such incidents have been steadily increasing since India's declaration of ceasefire
 shopiyaan main shanivaar subah aatankiyon ne sena kii bullate pruf gaadi par hamalaa kar diya tha or is hamale menatankiyonne sena kii gadiyon par kai goliyaan barasaai or grenade bhi daage
 On the other hand, on such growing attacks, Army Chief General Bipin Rawat warned that if Pakistan does not want Aman to help terrorists, then the guns of India's security forces will also not be silenced
 haalanki unhone ye bhi kaha ki agar halaat shantipurna rahen to sijafire ramajaan ke baad bhi lagu rah saktaa he
 "I want to go to Parliament and find a solution to the problems of Kashmir," says Shah Faisal
 is daur main, jab 17veen loksabhaa chunane ke liye taiyaar 90 karod bharatiyon kii matadaata suchi main tazaa shaamil hue yuva filmon or upanyaason kii romaaniat se baahar nikalakar siyasat ke daanv-pench samajhane lage hai, faisal kaa aisa kahana kaaphi romani lagata he
 Once again, Shivaji Rao Gaekwad of the hero film is remembered
 yun bhi ham faisal ko arvind kejariwal or imran khan kii siyasat kii tarif karte sun chuke hai
 If you look at Shah Faisal's career, he looks very filmy in itself
 aatankwaad se jujh rahe kashmir ke dur-daraaj ilaake ke shah faisal apane pita ko kho dete hai, magar ve medhaavi hai, doctorl kii degree hasil karte hai, lekin yahaan nahin rukate
 He becomes the first IAS topper of Kashmir and the media makes him a youth icon of Kashmir and stands against those who take up arms
 ve aam naukarshah nahin rahete, ve akhabaaron main likhte hai, fasebuk par likhte hai, yuvaaon ko protsaahit karte hai, madad karte hai
 He is a follower, he is an Opinion Maker
 kashmiri yuvaaon kaa ek hissaa unhen role model maanata he to doosraa unhen bharat sarkaar kaa agent kahkar khaarij karne kii koshish bhi karata he
 But now what next? They want to go to Harvard
 koshish karte hai, chookte hai, phir safal hote hai
 They talk about their failures on public platforms
 harvardcelautane par ve ghoshnaa karte hai ki ve bhartiya civil seva kaa hissaa nahin rahanaa chaahate
 They say that they are doing this in protest against the frequent killings in Kashmir and the growing extremist, intolerance in India and the Hindutva forces that have made 200 million Muslims a second-class citizen
 ve yah bhi kehete hai ki ve aaj kii hukumat ko yaad dilaanaa chaahate hai ki arabiai, sibiai or enie jaise lok sansthaanon kaa ksharan desh ke sanvaidhanik dhaanche ko barabaad kar saktaa he
 He is questioned why he did not resign before going to Harvard or in 2016 when hundreds of Kashmiris lost their lives
 ve kehete hai ki pichley do saal se ve is par vichaar kar rahe the or unhen samay tay karne main vakt laga
 This is their strategic decision and they want to bring the spotlight to Kashmir through this resignation
 ve spotlite kashmir par laane main kaamyaab to hote hai
 But for how long? This resignation gets headlines, for a day
 ikkaa-dukka opinian abhi bhi akhabaaron main dikhaai de rahe hai
 But what next? Yes, for Kashmiri Muslims, this is a remembered event, although the truth is that nothing surprises them anymore
 ve shah faisal ko lekar teen hisson main bante hue dikhte hai
 One part that is holding the Indian administrative structure and its Kashmir policy responsible for Shah Faisal's resignation
 shah faisal inke role model hai or inhen ab bhi ummid he ki faisal kashmir ke liye kuch behatar kar paaenge
 Others, who are still holding Shah Faisal as the collabrator, saying that this is India's next maneuver
 ye ve log hai jo elactoral politics ko khaarij karte rahe hai
 Because Shah Faisal talks of India in the declaration of his resignation, he is not acquitted of the charge of being an agent of this India even after his resignation
 or tisare ve, jo maanate hai ki yah ek mahatvakankshi vyakti kaa nijee maamla he or isse kashmir kii sthiti or raajnneeti par koi khaas asar nahin hoga
 They believe that when people like Sheikh Abdullah or Dr
 Farooq Abdullah could not do anything special for the Kashmir problem, then how can they expect an ambitious youth from a bureaucrat to become a leader
 kuch kaa maananaa yah bhi he ki aisa nirnay lekar apane paanvon par kulhadi maar chuke hai
 The dissatisfaction with the Government of India and its policies is evident in what Faisal has said about his resignation so far, but what does not appear is a resolved, holistic overview of the Kashmir problem being a civil officer and Kashmiri
 ve samasya par ekatarfa nazariyaa rakhte nazar aate hai
 An attitude that seems to be aimed at wooing the common Kashmiri Muslim voter
 or yaheen par unke istife par se unke adarshavaad or romaaniat kaa rang feekaa pad jaataa he
 They lose the respect of Indians who believe in the sovereignty and unity of India
 yahi kaaran he ki ipies abhinav kumaar indian express main likhe apane aalekh main kashmir samasya, kashmiri netaaon ke rukh or kashmir par aam bhartiya raay kaa vishleshan karte hue shah faisal ke istife ko propaganda qaraar de pate hai
 He says that his idealism of India can be genuine, but then his intention to use his target audience for his selfishness is equally real
 haalanki ise shah faisal kii raajnneetik aparipakvata kah kah unhen andeh kaa laabh bhi diya ja saktaa he
 His interview appeared in the Hindustan Times on 15 January and in his article published in this newspaper on 16 January, he is seen talking about his politics
 ve kehete hai ki elactoral politics kaa hissaa banakar ve gavarnence ko durust karnaa chahenge jabaki algaavvaadi hurriyat ko ve kashmiri musalmaan avam ke ‘centement’ kaa sangrakshak kehete hai
 His assertion of course gives hope that he wants to revisit the almost-finished electoral politics of Kashmir, by bringing transparency in it, and trying to preserve a democratic land in Kashmir
 ve maanate hai ki nai dilli ne elactoral politics kaa istemaal yah jataane main kiya he ki kashmir main sab thik-thaak he or ve yah bhi maanate hai ki kashmiri yuva kaa bharosa is raajnneeti se uth chukaa he
 In such a situation, it becomes adventurous to step into politics on its own
 ve kehete hai ki hamen bharat ko yah sach bataanaa hoga ki kashmiri yuva kii elactoral politics se badhati duuri, unki is vyavastha ke liye nafrat kii baangi he, or hurriyat kashmir masale kii ek ahm hissedaar he
 They say that the Kashmir problem has its roots deeper than radicalization
 beshak
 He says all these important things while understanding the Kashmiri Muslim sentiment, but forgetting to look at the Kashmir problem by understanding the sentiment of an Indian (which includes all Kashmiri Muslims, Hindus and he himself)
 ve bhul jate hai ki kisi bhi samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye uske har saajheedaar ke paksh ko saath rakhana zaruri hoga
 It is very important to tell the truth of Kashmir to other Indians, to show their point of view, but they have not yet seen the need to tell Kashmiri Muslims the truth of India, and to see the Kashmir problem from the perspective of other Indians
 unka istifa unka apana nirnay he lekin is istife ne unke kandhon par tamaam hindustaniyon kii ummiden daal di hai
 How much Faisal's decision is in India's interest, how much of Kashmir and how much he himself, it will decide his next steps and the time to come
 par tab tak ek ummid kahin na kahin baaki rahati he ki ek pratibhavan, mahatvakankshi yuva agar kashmir kii raajnneeti (jahaan kisi bhi raajnneetik party se judate hi netaa kii vishwasaneeyata khatre main aa jaati he) main utarane kaa khatra mol le rahaa he to shaayad uski koshishen pichley sattar saalon se gatiheen padi is vyavastha ko koi gati yaa disha de paaen

 Manoj Sinha said that under the jammu-baramulla Rail Link Project, the work of transporting the rail to Katra, the base camp of Mata Vaishno Devi, was completed last year

 Perhaps Sadasivam looks pleased as he moves towards creating a new tradition
 parampara ke alaava koi niyam he jo rajyapal banane se roktaa he
 The Congress NCPCPI alleges that all the parties have been conferred the post due to the bail of Amit Shah

 Responding to which, Sadashivam said that who knew that Amit Shah would become the President of BJP

 The judges should not hesitate to take up the post post retirement
 agar sahmati se faisla ho to main lokapal bhi banane ke liye taiyaar hum
 However, it was due to Sadashivam's decision that Narendra Modi had to write his wife's name in the nomination paper
 phir bhi congress netaa Anand Sharma said that there are many former Chief Justices in the country

 Never before has a Chief Justice been made a governor

 Arun Jaitley's speech became relevant at a conference of his party's legal cell in 2012
 jisamen ve kah rahe hai ki jajon main ritairement ke baad pad lene kii jo hode he usase nyaaypalika kii nishpakshta par asar pad rahaa he
 Post-retirement posts are being created through judicial decisions
 jajon kaa kyrkaal tay kiya jaae or unka pension unke aakhri vetan ke baraabar ho
 Jaitley's point was also supported by the then party president Nitin Gadkari and said that judges should not be given any post for two years after retirement
 varna sarkaar pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se court ko prabhavit kar sakati he or is desh main swatantra nishpaksh nyaaypalika kaa sapana kabhi puraa nahin ho sakegaa
 Gadkari said that i say this responsibly that before retiring it is decided for the judges of Supreme Court and High Court, which commission will be given to whom
 samasya yahi he
 Both of them said so responsibly that the same thing is being asked for accountability
 aakhir vipaksh main rahete hue kahi gayi in acchhee baton kaa satta main aane par kuch to istemaal hona chahie
 This part of Jaitley's statement is following the bjp's need to avoid the tendency of judges to follow the ballot box
 itnaa hi nahin, jab farvari 2013 main press council of india ke chairman ritred justise katju ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par narendra modi kii aalochana kii, tab jetali ne jawaab diya tha ki abhi bhi tribunel ardh-nyaayik padon kaa system chalata aa rahaa he jo in ritred jajon se bharaa jaataa he

 Kailash Vijayvargiya, the national general secretary and strategist of BJP president Amit Shah for the entire operation, met his mlas at the JRS Continental Hotel on the left of the road in front of the assembly in Dehradun at 10 am on May 10
 aatmavishvaas se labarej vijayawargeey ne vidhayakon se kaha, ''bispi vaale hamaare saath vot karenge
 The remaining three more Congress mlas will come
 sabase baatcheet ho chuki he
 You have to hold them with you inside the house
 '' tabhi kisi ne sawaal uthaaya—dilli main mayawati ne to bijepi kaa saath nahin dene kaa elaan kiya he, to vijayawargeey ne talkh andaaj main kaha—unki baatcheet ho chuki he
 But all the bjp's strategy within the Assembly was overshadowed when the arithmetic of the data went in favor of Harish Rawat in the Supreme Court-monitored power test
 shakti pareekshan main jeet ke baad ravat ne india today se kaha, ''aaj yahaan jo kuch hua vah uttarakhand or uske logon ke liye acha he
 For the first time in the last two months, i was so carefree
 '' nainital sthit haai court or phir supreme court, donon ke hi congress ke baagi vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraane ke spikar govind singh kunjwaal ke faisle ko sahi tehraane ke baad 70 sadasyon kii uttarakhand vidhansabha kii prabhavi shakti ghatakar 61 rah gai thi or usamen harish ravat ko aasaan jeet hasil hui
 This victory came after 54 tense days when former CM Vijay Bahuguna raised the flag of revolt for the first time
 vidhansabha kii kaarywahi ke aakhir main matvibhaajan main ravat or congress ko 33 vot mili, jabaki bijepi ko 28 vot mili
 Significantly, it also included the vote of another disgruntled Congressman Someshwar MLA Rekha Arya, who had a revenge on the last chance
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki shakti pareekshan se mahaj ghante bhar pehle tak aashwast bijepi kaa rajnatik prabandhan naakaam kaise ho gaya? darasal, vijayawargeey ke aatmavishvaas kii vajah bispi ke do vidhayakon or congress ke teen anya vidhayakon se hui deal thi, jiske jariye ravat ko alpamat main dikhaakar party dedh maheene se ho rahi aalochanaon kaa karaara jawaab dena chaahati thi
 How Kamalha blossomed before blooming But the biggest reason for the bjp's strategy to be a shock was that Shah himself handled the entire operation through Vijayvargiya and the role of all the leaders of the state unit was left to babus
 kisi bhi nirnay main unase salaah-mashvire ko tavajjo nahin di gai, balki aadesh par amal karne bhar ko kaha gaya
 For this reason, BJP made such a mistake just one day before the power test, which Shah did not expect
 sutron ke mutabik, bijepi ke sheersh ranneetikaron ne bispi supremeo mayawati ko bharose main lekar unke do vidhayakon ko apane paale main le liya tha
 In return, the BSP sought support from the BJP in the election of the district panchayat president of Haridwar
 yah soochna pradesh bijepi adhyaksh ajay bhatta ko bhi di gai lekin bispi kii shart thi ki is bare main saarvajanik taur par bijepi kuch nahin bolegi kyonki isse mayawati kaa uttar pradesh kaa siyaasi sameekaran bighad saktaa he
 According to sources, Bhatt did not understand this condition properly and on 9 May told the media in Haridwar that the party would support the BSP to defeat the Congress in the district panchayat
 jabaki ranneeti ke mutabik, unhen kahana tha ki congress ko haraane ke liye bijepi kisi ko bhi samarthan de sakati he
 However, according to sources, Bhatt was reprimanded by the central leadership on this mistake, but by then Arrow had left the command
 bijepi se santhganth kii baat saarvajanik hote hi mayawati ne der shaam tak varisht netaa nasimuddin siddiki ko dehradun bhej diya or unhone fouran ravat se sampark saadh apni nai ranneeti saajha kar lee
 But the BSP did not formally respond to the BJP, so the party remained in a tizzy
 haalanki agle din mayawati ne sansad bhawan main media se kaha ki unki party sampradayik takaton ko haraane ke liye kaam karegi
 He did not name the BJP then, but hinted
 bispi ke peeche hatate hi congress ke teen anya vidhayak bhi peeche hat gaye
 The BJP was agreeing to support the 33 (27 BJP / Rekha Arya / 2 BSP / 3 other Congress) mlas in its favor till 10 am
 is taatkaalik chook ke alaava bijepi kii sthaneey kalah bhi puure oparation ke khilaaf gai
 There are three former chief ministers in the state BJP, and Satpal Maharaj, who left the Congress and joined the BJP, was also hoping
 pradesh adhyaksh bhatta kii bhi najar mukhyamantri kii kursi par thi
 But after the imposition of President's rule, the way the atmosphere of sympathy for the Congress began to develop, the bjp's hands and feet swelled
 isliye kshetreey-saamaajik taur par ranneetik kaat ke liye purv mukhyamantri bhagat singh koshyari ko aage badhaane kaa man banaaya gaya jo ravat kii tarah hi kumaun kshetra se hai, or rajput hai
 a complete strategy was made for this
 lekin adalati pech main ulajh jane kii vajah se bijepi kaa mohara pit gaya
 Rebel leader Harak Singh Rawat also advocated that Koshyari be made the Chief Minister, so Satpal Maharaj went to Tilmila and issued a written statement saying, "who is Harak who decides the Chief Minister?" This party leadership will decide
 '' lekin kendriya netritv ne maharaj se congress ke samay ke apane kareebi chaar vidhayakon pro

 itnaa hi nahin, is puure oparation main purv mukhyamantri bi
 C
 khandudi or ramesh pokharial nishank bilkul kinare kar die gaye
 The role of the state BJP was only to win the yes of Vijayvargiya and state BJP incharge Shyam Jaju
 bijepi uttarakhand kii satta main kabiz hone ke liye itani baichaiyn thi ki uske ranneetikaar choti-choti chook ko samaj hi nahin paae
 On March 18, when the Finance Bill was to be discussed in the Legislative Assembly, on that morning, rebel mlas signed the letterhead of BJP President Ajay Bhatt and wrote a letter to the Governor and demanded voting in the House
 lekin spikar ne jab vitt vidheyak ko bina voting ke paas ghoshit kar diya to der shaam baagi vidhayakon ne phir vahi galati doharaai jo nainital hycourt ke saamne party virdohi gatividhi kaa pukhta pramaan bana
 According to sources, the central government started preparing cabinet notes even before the Governor's recommendation, which was a major lapse
 note main likhaa gaya ki spikar ne durbhaavna se congress ke nau vidhayakon kii sadsyta radd karne kaa faisla kiya, jabaki bijepi ke nilambit vidhayak bhimlaal arya par koi karrwai nahin kii
 The factual position was that no BJP application against Arya was still pending with the speaker
 ganvaaya zyada, paaya kamamukhyamantri ravat, unke vafaadaaron or dilli main baraabar pareshaan congress hikeman ke liye to yah takreeban 'ant bhala to sab bhala' he
 But the real message of Dehradun is to the BJP and also to what extent its new 'ruthlessly stubborn' leadership is ready to go under the shadow of Amit Shah
 us siyaasi gahamagahami par vichaar kiijie jo march se hi rajya kii afratfari se bhari rajdhani dehradun, sundar vaadiyon se saje nainital kii hycourt or nai dilli main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke daftar kii bheetar hi bheetar sulagati hui aabhohawaa ke bich chal rahi thi
 In this entire political upheaval, Harish Rawat has emerged as Baazigar in the Congress, and Koshiyari has increased in the BJP camp
 jis tarah se shakti pareekshan se pehle rekha arya bijepi ke saath ain or puure oparation main unhone sakriyata ke saath morcha sambhala, uskaa inaam unhen modi mantrimandal ke sambhavit vistaar main mil saktaa he
 However, a senior BJP leader says, "in Uttarakhand, this election will have to be contested under Koshiyari's leadership because the party has suffered politically and will be the most fit candidate in terms of regional equations
" isliye unhen kendriya mantri banaakar party rajya ko uchit pratinidhitiv degi
 At present, no MP from the state is in the Modi cabinet
 '' bijepi ab rajnatik nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye uttarakhand par zyada dhyaan de rahi he
 The understanding of party strategists is also being questioned as eight of the nine rebel mlas are from the Garhwal region, while Chief Minister Rawat comes from Kumaon
 isliye kumaun main unke liye sahanubhuti kii lahar ko bijepi bhaanp nahin pai
 However, the party claims that Rawat's image, which earlier looked like Ashwamedha's horse, has now become tainted
 sting opareshnon main kharid-farokht karte pakade ja chuke hai or sibiai is maamle main jaanch kar rahi he
 The BJP has been humming the satisfaction and success of so many times that 10 Congress mlas have broken and we have increased
 lekin tathy yah he ki uttarakhand kii ladaai main bijepi ne apni saakh ganvaai he or satta ko lekar uski tapakati laar jagajaahir ho gai he
 Not only this, questions are also being raised about how immature Shah's team is strategically
 andruni jaankaar kehete hai ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne uttarakhand ke gunabhag main ek behad ahm galati kar di
 a senior journalist who monitored the developments in Uttarakhand from the time he broke away from Uttar Pradesh and became a separate state says, "instead of relying on his own party unit in the state, he seemed more dependent on the dissidents of the Congress
 
 ''shakti pareekshan ke liye bijepi kaa aadhikarik thikaana congress ke solitare se ek furlongs kii duuri par jearar hotel tha
 It was also full of predictable faceless policemen and desperate partymen
 307 number ke kamare main rashtriya mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey haar maanane ko taiyaar nahin the
 He tells India Today, "BJP is the anti-party and will naturally welcome all those who want to stand with us
" ''kaise bani thi ranneetiravat sarkaar ko apdasth karne ke oparation se jude bijepi ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai, ''kareeb dedh saal pehle hi vijay bahuguna or harak singh ravat ne bijepi se sarkaar giraane ko lekar sampark saadhaa tha
 He spoke to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and former Chief Minister Koshyari
 lekin tab ham logon ne yah kahkar manaa kar diya tha ki yah hamaari party kaa siddhant nahin he
 But according to sources, Shah imposed party general secretary Vijayvargiya on the mission Uttarakhand during the Bihar elections in September 2015, saying that Rawat's stature in the state is very large and he is more likely to win the 2017 assembly elections
 isliye congress kii kalah kaa phayda uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Sources say that talks were held at that time Vijay Bahuguna, the leader of Vijayvargiya and the rebel faction of the Congress
 lekin bihar main sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ke aarakshan vaale bayaan se siyaasi sameekaran bigadgaye laga to shah kii ore se vijayawargeey ko philhal rukne ko kaha gaya taaki koi or vivaad na ho
 But the story took a decisive turn on 3 March 2016
 bahuguna or duusare baagi netaa harak singh ravat ne bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh ajay bhatta or upaadhyaksh dhan singh ravat se sampark saadhaa
 After this, the high command was informed
 ab shah ne vijayawargeey ko pashchim bengal chunaav chhodkar sara dhyaan uttarakhand par dene kaa nirdesh diya
 The BJP leadership negotiated directly with the rebel faction of the Congress and explored the extent of their opposition
 haalanki shuruyaat main baagi gut kii ore se 13 vidhayakon ke samarthan kii baat kahi gai
 But later this number stood at nine
 rajyapal ne ravat sarkaar ko 28 march tak bahumat sabit karne kaa samay de diya
 This shocked the strategy of BJP and rebel mlas
 ab kya he bijepi kii ranneetibijapi ab bhi uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan ko apni chook maanane se inkaar kar rahi he
 He argues that a constitutional crisis had arisen in the state in which the central government had to fulfill its responsibility and now respects the decision of the Supreme Court
 lekin party adalati dakhal se kitni tilamilaai hui he iskaa saboot sansad main dikhaa jab kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ne gubaar nikaala
 He said that the courts are interfering in every function of the legislature
 sansad kaa kaam sirf bajet paas karana or tex kaa rah gaya he, isse behatar he ki court yah kaam bhi apane haath main le le
 According to sources, the BJP is still not in the mood to leave the battle of Uttarakhand
 rajya ikai se jude ek netaa ke mutabik, agar aane vaale samay main phir congress ke kuch vidhayak tut jaaen to koi aashcharya kii baat na hogi
 But before that, the big strategists of Modi cabinet are unhappy with the strength test under the supervision of the court
 ek varisht mantri kehete hai, ''aaj court ne shakti pareekshan kaa aadesh diya, kal ko vah yah bhi kah sakati he ki falaan bill paas karo yaa phir falaan vishay par sansad main bahes karo
 Will the proceedings of the Houses work like this? Now the fine line of the legislature-judiciary should be clear
 '' is varisht mantri ne yah bhi sanket diya ki sarkaar is tarah ke kai anya rajyon ke masalon ko milakar anuchhed 143 ke tahat presidential reference ke liye supreme court ja sakati he
 On the other hand, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu publicly stated that the role of the speakers should be decided
 modi sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki uttarakhand ke alaava telugana main tidipi ke 13 vidhayakon kaa paala badalakar tiares ke saath jane or isi tarah andhra pradesh main viesar congress ke kuch vidhayakon kaa tidipi main janaa, arunachal main uthapatak aadi aisi kai misaalen hai jahaan dalbadal kanoon kaa makhul ud rahaa he or spikar faisla lene main deree kar ise badhaava de rahe hai
 There is also an opinion within the government that a complete change should be made in the anti-defection law
 is tarah kii raay par venkaiya naidu nijee raay dete hai, ''koi bhi chunaa hua pratinidhi agar apni party badalanaa chahta he to use pehle pad se istipha dena chahie or dobaaraa chunaav laduya chahie yaa nahin to aisa praavdhaan hona chahie ki party badalte hi uski sadsyta swatah khatm ho jaae
 He also said that if a speaker counts 90 to 19 and then says that the decision of the speaker under Article 212 is final, then his remedy is only Article 356 (president's rule)

 Those gullible rapes raped that innocent for a week and then when they were going to kill that innocent, then a policeman says to them "wait a while and i will also scrape it again
 To kill " 18 maah puraani is vaardaat ke baad ab adaalat ne insaaf kiya he
 The court convicted 6 darinda

 He lived in Rasna, a village in Kathua
 wo rajasav adhikari ke pad se ritair hokar vahaan rahane laga tha
 Sanji Ram was also the chief servant of the village temple
 wo bhagwaan kaa sevak hokar bhi puraa shaitan tha
 The same vicious bravado planned to make the innocent girl his victim and also implemented his plan

 Those poor people kept her hungry and thirsty

 But it is said that Havan has no religion or caste
 isliye is haivaaniyat ko dharm ke chashme se nahin balki sirf or sirf kanoon ke chashme se dekha jaae
 Anger is not surprising, on the thinking of people who find religion and religion in a crime-raping gang rape
 us vakt kuch logon ne kaha tha ki us bacchee ke balaatkaariyon ko chhod do, jinhone kathua ke ek mandir main apni havas mitaai thi
 Say your hand on your heart
 aise logon ko dharm ke naam par chhod bhi den to kuya iske apane hi dharm ke log yaa iske apane kareebi-rishtedaar apane hi ghar kii kisi bacchee ko inke saath akelaa chhodane kii himmat karenge?isse pehle ki aap jawaab den zaruri he ki us bacchee kii kahani ek baar zarur sun lijie
 This story is not just a story but a part of the charge sheet filed in the district court of Kathua

 Some families of the minority Bakarwal community had settled in and around the village Rasna in the dreadful conspiracy of Kathji, the temple servitor Sanji Ram
 gaanv ke mandir kaa sevadaar sanji ram is samudaay ke logon se bevajaah chidata tha
 He wanted to remove those people from there
 pashu paalan par nirbhar bakarwaal samudaay ke log prakruti ke kareeb rahanaa pasand karte hai
 So they live near the forest
 sanji ram ne un logon ko vahaan se hataane kii kai koshishen kii lekin koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 Eventually Sanji Ram's diabolical mind became the blueprint for this dreadful plot
 apharan ke baad gang repasanji ram hameshaa bakarwaal samudaay kii 8 varshiya us maasoom or chanchal bacchee ko roj pashuon ke saath jangal main jate hue dekhtaa tha
 Seeing that girl, Satan woke up in her mind
 sanji ram ne apni yojana ke tahat apane naaballig bhattije ko bhi gunaah main shaamil kar liya
 The talk was the day of 10 January 2018
 wo maasoom bacchee roj kii tarah apane jaanwaron ko jangal main charaa rahi thi
 He had no idea that these moments would be the most dreadful moments of his life
 sanji ram kaa naaballig bhatija bacchee ke peeche jangal main pahunch jaataa he
 He breaks down on the girl as soon as she gets the chance
 wo jabaran maasoom bacchee ko lekar us mandir main pahunchaa, jiskaa sevadaar uskaa chachaa sanji ram tha
 According to the chargesheet filed in the court, the minor girl forcibly fed cannabis to the girl by bringing it to a room of the temple
 phir usne bacchee ke saath rape kiya
 After erasing the lust, he also called Sanji Ram's son there and then together they gang-raped the child
 iske baad usne apane chachaa sanji ram ko is baat kii khabar di
 Sanji Ram asked for unconscious medicine from someone and he too reached the temple
 iske baad lagaataar bacchee ko peeta gaya, uske saath har din balaatkaar kiya gaya
 This sequence continued
 kai baar behoshee kii haalat main bhi uske saath rape kiya gaya
 This is how the police started the investigation
 On January 12, the girl's father reached the Hiranagar police station
 usne police ko bataaya ki teen din se uski beti ghar nahin ai

 uske saath team main eesai pravesh kumaar, surinder kumaar or head consteble tilak raaj bhi shaamil the
 Meanwhile, Sanji Ram's minor nephew called his cousin Vishal Jangotra, son of Sanji Ram, in Meerut and told him that if he wants to rape an eight-year-old girl, he should immediately come to Kathua
 chargeshit ke mutabik vishaal agali hi train se kathua pahunchataa he or mandir main jaakar behosh bacchee se rape karata he
 According to the rape chargesheet by the policemen before the murder, the investigating officer Deepak Khajuria went to the village temple after locating the girl
 lekin sari baat jaanakar wo sabko turant giraftaar karne kii bajaay sanji ram ke bhattije ke parivaar ko blackmel karne laga
 It has been written in the charge sheet that he also recovered one and a half lakh rupees in return for saving the boy
 jab wo mandir pahunchaa tha, to bacchee behosh padi thi
 Sanjiram says that now he has to be killed
 is par jaanch adhikari khajuriya kahata he ki thodi der ruk jaao
 i can also do something
 iske baad wo police adhikari bhi us bacchee se rape karata he
 After that all the accused take turns gang-raping that 8-year-old innocent
 havas mitaane ke baad wo darinde us bacchee kaa galaa ghont kar use maar dete hai
 Not only this, the ghoulish accused crush his head with a stone
 uski laash ko jangal main phenk diya jaataa he
 So much pain with the innocent that someone's heart may be shaken
 chargeshit ke tahat sanji ram, uskaa betaa vishaal, sab inspector anand datta, do vishesh police adhikari deepak khajuriya or surendra verma, head consteble tilak raaj or sthaneey nivasee pravesh kumaar ke khilaaf rape, murder or saboot mitaane kaa maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 This is the whole story of Kathua

 What are you thinking man baari he? vaazib he
 But we live in this world
 naaj karte hai apni sabhyataa par
 We do not get tired to say that we taught the world the wisdom of the world and where have we reached now? What if justice is done? What will be the punishment for the man who has died inside millions of people like you while listening to this story?

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has made a big attack on the development model of bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi
 rahul ne modi ke gujarat model ko 'toffee model' qaraar diya
 Speaking in Latur, Maharashtra, the Congress Vice President said that there was a time of Advani and Vajpayee in the BJP, whereas today it is the era of Modi and Adani
 modi par rahul ke waar se bijepi baukhala gai he
 The BJP hit back at the Congress prince, saying that Congress leaders are scared of Modi
 bijepi pravaktaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne poocha, 'rahul gandhi wadra jameen saude par kya kahenge? haryana, rajasthan main wadra kii jameen par rahul kya kahenge?' nakvi ne gujarat model par rahul ko homework karne kii naseehat bhi de daali
 At an election rally in Latur on Monday, Rahul said that Modi's toffee model has benefited only one industrialist in the state while farmers and poor were ignored
 unhone kaha ki bijepi apane prachaar postaron main mahilaon ke shashaktikaran kii baat karti he
 Its party workers along with RSS activists beat up women in pubs in Mangalore and the Gujarat Chief Minister used his strength and police machinery to tap a woman's phone
 rahul ne kaha, 'gujarat model ke bare main main aapako bataanaa chahta hum
 Have you heard about Advani? adwani, jaswant singh ko darkinar kar diya gaya he
 Now a new leader has emerged
 vah narendra modi hai
 Earlier, there used to be participation of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advani
 ab modi or adani kii saajhedaari he
 The Congress leader said, "45000 acres of the size of Aurangabad was given for just Rs 300 crore
" yah toffee model he, gujarat model nahin
 You get toffee here for one rupee
 unki jameen ko ek rupee prati meter ke daam par bech diya gaya
 It was the land of the poor and the farmers
 'rahul ne kaha ki naino car banane ke liye 10 hajaar karod rupee kaa rin diya gaya
 This amount is more than the money spent on health and education in Gujarat
 bijepi ke prachaar postaron main mahilaon ke shashaktikaran ke daawey par unhone kaha ki party shasit chhattisgarh main 20 hajaar mahilaayein laapata hai
 The Congress Vice President accused the BJP of copying the Manifesto of the Congress
 rahul ne kaha ki congress ne pehle hi purv sainikon ke liye ek rank ek pension yojana lagu kar di he, ab bijepi daawa kar rahi he ki satta main aane par vah is kaarykram ko lagu karegi
 The bjp's manifesto talks of fighting corruption

 Two brothers, a nephew and his associates of Janardhana Reddy, accused of illegal mining, are ticketed by the BJP
 reddy bandhuo ko tikat die jane ko lekar bies yediurppa ne kaha ki bijepi alaakaman kii manjuuri ke baad hi unhen utaara gaya he
 In an exclusive interview with India Today, BS Yeddyurappa admitted that he had taken lessons from his old tenure
 yediurppa ne kaha ki janardan reddy chunaav nahin lard rahe hai, sirf party kii madad kar rahe hai taaki bellari ke aas-paas kii kareeb 15 siten bijepi jeet saken
 On giving tickets to the Reddy brothers, BJP President Amit Shah is clearly saying that the party has nothing to do with Janardhana Reddy
 yediurppa se jab sawaal poocha gaya ki kya reddy bandhuon ko tikat shah kii manjuuri se die gaye hai
 So he said that yes, obviously the ticket has been given only after Amit Shah's approval
 yediurppa ko bellari ke reddy bandhuon se madad lene main koi pareshaani nahin he
 These days the Reddy brothers are campaigning for the BJP candidates in a nearby Bellary
 party ne karnataka main150 vidhansabha sitenjitne kaa lakshya tay kiya he
 Yeddyurappa said, "being given a ticket does not mean that we support corruption
 ham saavdhaan he or bareeki se najar he
 Yeddyurappa slammed Siddaramaiah's remarks in which he said that BJP has imported Modi and Yogi for campaigning in the state, not just the leader in Karnataka
 yediurppa ne kaha ki siddharmaiya se poochna chahta hum, rahul gandhi koun he kya vah bahari nahin he
 Is he born in Karnataka? yediurppa ne kaha ki karnataka ke logon kii ummiden congress ke raaj main puri nahin hui hai
 People are fed up with corruption, misuse of funds and government failures
 unhone kaha ki main logon ko aashwast kar rahaa hum ki bina kisi bhrashtachar ke achche shashan pradaar karenge

 The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday night searched the shelves of Congress MP Naveen Jindal, who returned from abroad
 jindal ko unki company jindal steel evam power limited (jeespel) ko koyala block ke aavanton kii jaanch main shaamil hone ko kaha gaya tha
 The CBI had raided Prithviraj Road, six, a resident of Jindal's government on June 11, but could not complete its work as some of the shelves had locks and could only be opened by Jindal who was out of the family at the time
 sibiai sutron ne bataaya ki shuukravaar subah ek talaashi dal unke ghar gaya or jindal kii upasthiti main unki aalmaariyaan khangaali
 Jindal is also named along with former Minister of State for Coal d Narayan Rao in the FIR filed for alleged fraud and bribery
 sibiai ne jindal se kaha tha ki vah yathashighra jaanch main shaamil hon kyonki ye aalmaariyaan unke pahunchane ke baad hi khul sakati hai
 According to the FIR, in 2008, when Rao was the Minister of State for Coal, JSPL and Gagan Sponge Iron Limited had acquired Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block in Jharkhand by allegedly presenting false facts
 gagan spanj aayran limited bhi jindal kii hi company he
 CBI sources claimed that the block was allotted to JSPL in January 2008, within a year of it, the shares of Rao's company Saubhagya Media, which were listed at Rs 28, were given by Jindal's company New Delhi Exim Ltd for Rs 100 per share
 At the rate of Rs
 2
25 crores and thus an investment of about Rs
 aarope he ki yah avaidh rup se laabh pahunchaaya gaya
 jspl's head of foreign affairs Manu Kapoor had earlier said, "law-abiding company JSPL operates with a strict code of conduct
 koyala block aavanton kii sibiai jaanch chal rahi he
 JSPL is committed to fully support the CBI at this stage of the investigation
 'sibiai ne daawa kiya ki jeespel ne janvari, 2007 main kaha tha ki uske paas keval teen koyala block hai jabaki uske paas kam se kam chah koyala block the
 Sources said that this was done to increase their eligibility to get Amarkonda Murgadangal coal block as the government was looking at stopping monopoly by not allocating too many blocks to a single company

 - Middlesex Cricket (@middlesex_ccc) August 31, 2017 Surrey captain Garethy Betty said that the sudden arrow was first seen by someone in the air, due to the noise it was difficult to predict that it could have been a fatal hit
 Or that some big accident could have happened, that arrow fell directly into the playground at 4:20 am local time, that arrow was standing 25 meters away from that arrow, that arrow was actually made of very sharp metal
 police ne tir ko 'crossbo bolt ' jaisaa bataaya joki saare or middlesex ke khilaadiyon ke bich maidan main gira tha
 It can also be called an array, said Richard Gould, chief executive of Surrey
 kyonki jahaan se yah aayaa he vah maidan chaaron ore se ek ghaney kshetra he
 'we are investigating the reports that some activity has been seen on the roof of the OCS stand, but what we have not been able to do there, we will check whether the deadly arrow came from the roof or from the outside

 In Udaipur, Rajasthan, a very shameful incident came to light on Thursday when thousands of people started to gather in the town hall grounds to rally in favor of Shambhu Lal Reger, who was accused of cutting Afrajul
 dopaher hote-hote badi sankhya main log shanbhu laal ke paksh main naare lagaate hue bas stand, chetak cirkil or toun haal tak pahunch gaye
 In fact, the police feared this, that is why Section 144 was imposed from Wednesday evening in Udaipur and Rajsamand district by imposing prohibitory orders
 saath hiinternet par puri tarah se pratibandh tha, iske baavjood dhara 144 ko todate hue badi sankhya main hinduvadi sanghathanon ke kaaryakarta ikattha hone lage
 The atmosphere did not deteriorate, so the police started chasing them
 pehle to halkaa bal prayog kar un par kaabo paane kii koshish kii gai, lekin jab bheed badhane lagi to police ne dauda-dauda kar peetna shuru kiya
 After the lathi charge, the workers of the Hindu organization started taking shelter in the streets and houses
 police ne aise darjanon kaaryakartaaon ko gharon se nikaal nikaal kar hiraasat main liya he or sabake upar mukadmaa darj kiya gaya he
 Earlier, the chairman of the Vishwa Hindu Sanatan Sangathan, who announced a rally in favor of Shambhulal Raigad by threatening the police on social media, was arrested by the Jaipur police station before reaching Udaipur
 jis tarah se udaipur main ek hatyare ke paksh main log ikattha hue, nishchit rup se yah maanavtaa ke liye sharmasaar kar dene vaali ghatana he

 The land of terror is slowly slipping
 chupane ke liye jagah bhi ab kam pad rahi he
 In such a situation, the leader of ISIS, Baghdadi is going to play a new game to regain its strength
 ye khel he jehar kaa
 In fact, Baghdadi is collecting chemical experts from all over the world and making them chemical weapons, so that as a last attempt, they can use them on a large scale
 khabar he ki rasinic hathiyaaron kii khep wo syria ke rakka shahar main jamaa kar rahaa he
 There is also news that Baghdadi is currently hiding in this Raqqa city
 IS taiyaar kar rahaa he chemical vepanjiskaa khauf tha aakhir vahi ho rahaa he
 When Baghdadi, the boss of terror, felt that his hookah was going to rise from Iraq, he vowed not to live nor to live
 bagdadi ne iraq main maha tabaahi kii ibaarat likhni shuru kar di he or is tabaahi kii sabase badi gavaahi de rahi he wo khabar jo aatank ke garh rakka se baahar ai he
 According to the US intelligence agency, Chemical Weapon Cell is preparing ISIS for the last battle in Iraq and Syria
 ji, khabar pukhta he
 Seeing the Sultanate plundered, Baghdadi has started to accumulate its chemical weapon experts worldwide, besides Iraq and Syria, and has been engaged in the manufacture of chemical weapons
 america raksha vibhaag ke pravaktaa ke mutabik syria main rakka ke najadik mayadin or alkaaim ke najadik sabhi chemical vepan exparts ko jamaa kiya gaya he
 The terrorists want to save their chief
 It is believed that ISIS has gathered all its special terrorists and weapons here
 aatank kaa ye puraa plan sirf isliye taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he ki taaki iesas apane aakaa abu bakar al bagdadi ko bachaa sake
 It is believed that Baghdadi may be hiding the same
 america khufia agencyke mutabik pichley kuch hafton main iraq or syria main aatanki chote bade kai chemical hamale kar chuke hai
 There have been reports earlier that ISIS is trying to increase the capacity of its chemical weapons to protect its remaining strongholds and to keep a stock of chemical weapons in the residential areas to save its life from the attack of the forces
 is
 united neshns ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik, aatanki ammonia or sulfur kaa bhandar ikattha kar rahe hai
 Which can be used to prevent the army from advancing
 rasinic hamale se nipatane ke liye sena taiyacamerica dephence ministry ne bhi mana he ki aakhri palon main aatanki rasinic hathiyaaron kaa istemaal karne kii firaaq main hai
 However, the army has also made preparations to avoid chemical attack
 saath hi khabar he ki aies apane aakhri garh ko bachaane ke liye chemical plant main dhamaakaa bhi kar saktaa he
 Earlier too, the CIA had given many such evidence in which it was proved that ISIS has used chemical weapons in the battlefield
 aisa mana jaataa he ki kareeb 3 saal pehle mosul par kabze ke baad aatankiyon ne yahaan kii uniwarsity se 40 kilo uranium or radioective chemical kii chori kii thi
 On which they have prepared chemical weapons
 yuan main iraq ke rajdoot ne bhi is baat kaa khulaasa kiya tha ki iesas ne newclear padaarth ko apane kabje main le liya he or ab aatanki iskaa istemaal apni jaan bachaane ke liye kar sakate hai
 ISIS has been mobilizing new weapons since 2011, ISIS has been trying to acquire new weapons since 2011
 isi koshish main uske haath iraq or syria main kabze ke baad chlorine, mustard gas, sarin gas, tabun or viex rasinic tatv kaa zakhira laga tha
 All these gases fall under the category of nerve gas, which are the gases used in chemical attack
 iraq or syria main aam logon or senaaon par chemical hamale kar iesas ne ye to saaf kar diya he ki wo khud ke vajood ko bachaane ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja saktaa he
 But the way terrorists are preparing chemical weapons on such a large scale, they can surely be fatal for the world
 isaki shuruuaat in aatankiyon ne iraq main fouj par chemical atake kar ke kar bhi di
 There is an old saying, the thief should go by stealing, but do not go through the sin
 iraq main iesas ke aatankwaadiyon kii haalat bilkul aisi hi he
 The army that is overshadowing IS militants The situation of the militants in the ongoing war between the army and ISIS in Mosul, one of the largest and most important bases of the country, is getting thinner
 lekin jate-jate bhi ye aatankwaadi apni harkaton se baaj nahin aa rahe hai
 This time, terrorists have suspected chemical attack on the army
 ji haa, aatankwaadiyon ne mosul ke al-abaar ilaake main iraqi fuj par us khatarnaak mustard gas se hamalaa kiya he, jisase pal bhar main logon kii jaan ja sakati he
 The result of this attack by terrorists is that it has created over 20 soldiers' lives, and they have been taken away from maidan-e-jung for treatment
 aatankwaadiyon ne foujpar chlorine missile daagi thi
 While this time there is an attack of mustard gas
 america or australia jaise mulkon kii madad se iraqi fouj lagaataar iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ko desh se khadedane main juty he
 Mosul is still the last time Mosul is one of the last places where militants are fighting the army
 lekin acchhee baat ye he ki fouj ne aadhe se zyaada shahar par kabja kar liya he or philhal iesas ke aatankwaadi pashchimi mosul ke ek chote se ilaake main kaid hokar rah gaye hai
 In such a situation, his back is stuck against the wall and all the ways of his escape are constantly closed
 jabaki aatankwaadiyon kaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi pehle hi mosul se bhaag chukaa he
 In such a situation, the terrorists do not want to hold back from using those last weapons, which is expected to prolong the war
 mosul main hua ye chemical atake isi kaa subut he
 But now in view of this act of terrorists, in the next battle, the army wants to confront the terrorists with the arrangements to avoid chemical attacks
 begunaah shahriyon kii jaan par ban ai hamosul main chalati is jang ke bich sabase buree haalat un hajaaron begunaah shahriyon kii he, jo shahar ke un andruni ilaakon main fanse hue hai or jahaan aatankwaadiyon kaa kabja he
 The terrorists do not want to let them leave the city, using them as their shield
 or to or ye baat ab sanyukt raashtra sangh ne bhi kahi he ki ye haal ke dinon main kisi maidan-e-jang main begunaah shahriyon par aayaa sabase bada sankat he
 In such a situation, if there is a chemical war or chemical warfare in the future, then it will definitely affect the common people
 apni sultanate ko haath se nikalate or khud kii maut ko najadik aata dekh bagdadi or uske aatanki ab vahashipan par utar aae hai
 Baghdadi terrorists are now attacking ordinary civilians with chemical weapons to protect themselves from the Iraqi army
 in rasinic hamalon kii vajah se log ghut-ghutakar or tadap-tadapakar mar rahe hai
 The ISIS terrorists, who are using chemical weapons, are now convinced that it is not possible for them to survive the attack of Iraqi forces, they have started using weapons that do not hurt but in the last battle of Mosul
 -kills by torturing
 duniya bagdadi or uske aatankiyon kii in goliyon se zyaada dari hui nahin he
 The world no longer feels threatened by these bomb blasts, but rather the world is getting frightened by the latest threat which is called chemical chemical
 mosul se ab is tarah kii khabaren aam ho rahi hai ki aatanki jo dhamaake kar rahe hai uske baad ajibo-garib tasviren or asar dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 This kind of strange effect has taken place in the mood of the people of the area coming under the blast
 kahin khaal udhad gai to kahin haath-pair jalakar un par kaale fafole pad gaye hai
 However, investigation is going on now
 chemical mustard se bhare rocket daagejankaar or vaigyanik is baat kii tasdik kar rahe hai ki ye usee chemical vepan kaa asar he jiske khauf main duniya ji rahi he
 According to a report by an Iraqi website Alsumaria, ISIS militants fired three rockets loaded with deadly chemical mustard in the Qayrah area off Mosul
 jiske dhamaake main 7 log buree tarah jhulas kar mar gaye
 While the body of a 5-year-old child got badly burnt
 irbil ke aspataal main bachche kaa ilaaj chal rahaa he
 According to the child's family, after the rocket explosion, there was a strange smell and people who got in the way started feeling jealous in their body
 sanyukt raashtra pehle hi mosul main aatankiyon ke chemical hathiyaar istemaal karne kii chetavanee jari kar chukaa he
 Not only this, the UN fears that ISIS has a stock of hazardous chemicals such as mustard gas, ammonia and sulfur, which can cause havoc
 rasinic hathiyaaron se itnaa khauf isliye he kyonki ye pal bhar main hi hajaaron–lakhon logon ko maut kii neend sula detaa he
 If someone somehow survives, then he is forced to die after suffocating diseases
 chemical vepan khatarnaak isliye bhi he kyonki jab tak logon ko is jahrile hamale kaa andaja lagata he tab tak kaaphi der ho chuki hoti he
