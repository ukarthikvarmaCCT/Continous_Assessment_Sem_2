 There is a medical college in Indore
 index medical college
 On 10 June 2018, Smriti Laharpure committed suicide
 8 agast ko usee medical college kii ek or chaatra shivani uike ne aatmahatya kar lee
 Both are due to one
 fees
 Arbitrary fees
 shivani uike ek acchhee doctor ban sakati thi magar fees kii maar ne use maar diya
 He has written in his suicide note that 'I want to cure everyone but what to do, i don't understand anything
 soch rahi hum ki shaayad ye karuungi to ek kaa karcha kam ho jayega
 i don't think I'm doing anything wrong
 mujhe bahut gilti feel hoti he aapse paisa maangane main
 Doesn't sound good at all
 ' Private medical colleges do not know anything
 admician ke vakt fees kuch or hoti he or uske baad achaanak kai lakh badha di jaati he
 These students reach here through NEET examination
 in par paise kaa dabaav itnaa hota he ki karj lekar fees bharne kii bhi ek seemaa hoti he
 The seat is so difficult to find that the decision to leave it is no less fatal
 10 june ko smriti laharpure ne bhi aatmahatya kar lee
 It is the memory of this college
 paanch saal embibies kii padhai karne ke baad yahaan emdi karne ai thi
 i am reading a part of his suicide note which will give an idea of how the neck of the students is pressed to collect fees in these colleges
 '2017 main counselling ke dauraan mujhe jo fees bataai gai thi uske anusaar tution fees 8 lakh 55 hazaar or hostel fees 2 lakh rupye thi
 After this, when i came to join the college, the index college management asked me for two lakh rupees in the name of cash money and extra-curricular activity
 chunki main madhyamvargeey parivaar se hum isliye atirikt fees nahin chukaa sakati thi lekin neet pariksha ke baad bamushkil mila piji karne kaa ye avasar haath se naa nikal jaae isliye maine do lakh kaa phir lone liya
 After this, as soon as i arrived to join the college management again demanded two lakh rupees
 iske baad raat bhar ke prayaas ke baad maine apni seat khone ke dar se maine vyavastha bhi kii lekin college ne tution fees 8 lakh 55 hazaar se 9 lakh 90 hazaar kar di or sabhi chaatro se yah fees jamaa karne ko bolaa
 Apparently, it was difficult for everyone to bear the one lakh and 35 thousand fee increase, so all of us went against it to Jabalpur High Court
 iske baad college prabandhan ne mujhe vyaktigat taur par pratadit karnaa shuru kar diya
 Apart from this, on the phone, i was threatened to withdraw this case
 iske baad court ne index college ko nirdhaarit fees lene kaa aadesh diya lekin iske baad phir agle saal 9 lakh 90 hazaar rupye maangane lage
 
 
 i deposited only 8 lakh 55 thousand as per court order

 iske baad jab main college main jwine karne ai to index college prabandhan ne mujhase coshan mani or extra karikular activity ke naam par phir do lakh rupye maange
 Since i am from middle class family, so could not pay extra fees, but after the NEET exam, i hardly got the opportunity to do PG, so i took a loan of two lakhs again
 iske baad main jaise hi jwoin karne pahunchi college prabandhan ne phir do lakh rupye maang liye
 After this, after the overnight effort, i also made arrangements for fear of losing my seat but the college raised tuition fees from 8 lakh 55 thousand to 9 lakh 90 thousand and asked all the students to collect this fee

 sonia gandhi kaha ki vah desh se poochna chaahati hai ki kya may 2014 se pehle desh ek blueole tha or sirf is taarikh ke baad hi desh ne sab kuch kiya he
 Deliberately giving frivolous statements, he said, "frenzied statements are being made deliberately by the ruling government and its result will be wrong in front of us

 On the issue of advising Congress President Rahul Gandhi not to impose his views on others, Sonia said that she does not try to impose her opinion on anyone
 lihaaja yah jaruri ki unhen unka kaam karne kii puri swatantraaa rahe
 He said that all the leaders of the party have their own way of working

 '2019 kaa chunaav zarur jeetengevartmaan modi sarkaar ke achche din par bolte hue sonia gandhi ne kaha ki 'achche din' kii sthiti bhi 'shining india' jaisi ho gai he
 In 2019 general elections, the condition of 'achhe Din' will also be like 'shining India'
 bijepi vaade puure nahin kar saki he or vah logon ke ummiido par khari nahin utari
 On upa's victory in the next general election, he said that he is confident that UPA will be able to win this election
 apane raajnneetik safar ke bare main sonia ne kaha ki vah nahin chaahati thi ki rajeev raajnneeti main aaen, lekin unhen indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad raajnneeti main aana padaa
 Similarly, she herself did not want to enter politics, but she also had to take this decision in compulsion

 If she did not do this, people would have been cowardly

 He is aware of his abilities

 das din pehle aae tabaahi ke sailaab kaa sataaya uttarakhand aaj bhi karaah rahaa he
 The flood of devastation there caused the most destruction in the Kedar Dham itself
 vahaan mandir ke sivaa kuch nahin bachaa he
 Ten days later, how did the temple of Kedarnath, for this, our correspondent Ashok Singhal stayed in Kedarnath for 24 hours with cameraman Sanjay Chaudhary
 sanhaar ke devtaa ke dar par maut kaa manjar kuch aisa failaa ki 10 din baad bhi yahaan kuch he to ek daraavna sannata
 The temple of Lord Kedarnath, one of the four dhams, is also left to tell the existence of Kedardham
 nahin to sab kuch tabah ho gaya
 Tearing the clouds from the sky, there was such devastation that nothing was left here except this temple of Baba Kedarnath
 mandakini or saraswati nadi kii kal-kal dharaaen bhagwaan shiv ke kadamon ko chumkar yahaan aage badhati hai
 But on 16 June, there was a cry of frightening floods from the mountain ranges around Kedarnath
 us vakt jo log mandir main the, unke liye wo sailaab mahapralay se kam nahin tha
 Baba's city started getting destroyed
 badi badi imaaraten girane lageen
 Along with the family, people from their villages - the people who came in batches with the people of the city, started swimming in the waves
 tejadhaar laharon ke saath aate bade bade pattharon ne devbhumi kii sabase paavan dharti ko matiamet karnaa shuru kar diya
 The Devnagari that had been inhabited in centuries was ruined in moments
 baba kedarnath ke dar par pahunchakar vahaan kaa haal aapako bataa rahaa he ajtak
 
 
 God has survived in the flood of flood, but not a devotee
 bhagwaan kaa mandir bhi batch gaya he lekin ab unke chabutare par bhakthi kii gunj nahin
 Nandi is also seated, but now no one takes care of Nandi
 jis nagari main kabhi bhi shiv dhun kii mahima band nahin hui, vahaan maut kaa sannata or anhoni kii ashanka ke sivaa kuch bhi nahin bachaa he
 Baba's name is no longer ringing where every Mahadev's echo was heard
 or naa hi bhole bhandari kaa jalabhishek hua
 When the waterfall came, a big stone came and started behind the temple
 isse mandir to surakshit batch gaya, lekin aage-peeche-daaen-baayen kuch bhi nahin bachaa
 When the flood of floods ended, only the temple remained between destruction and destruction

 After all, what is the relation of astrology with losing things, when things are lost continuously and when things will definitely be lost
 aaie jaanate hai
 
 
 - The loss of things is seen in the 6th, 11th and 12th houses - There are 4 of the transiting Moon, 6th, 8th or 12th are the loss of things when they are in the house - Things are suddenly lost when Rahu and Moon are combined
 If it is related to Saturn or Mars then things are not found - but if Venus, Guru or auspicious planets are in it then things are found- usually the things lost on Saturday are either not found or found too late
 However, when do you lose things constantly and when should you be careful about losing things? - If your horoscope is in the position of Rahu, Ketu or Mercury - if you are running a half-and-half sati or dhaya of Saturn - if your zodiac sign is Taurus, Virgo Or Capricorn or Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces - if your radix is 02, 04, Or 08- If you have raised a brown dog or taken a black car, you can get it by losing things? - When things are lost on Monday or Wednesday - When measures are lost on losing things - When the Guru is strong Or is the vision of the Guru - when the half-and-half or the dhaya is coming off - when your radix is 05, 07 or 09, is it a sign of loss of baggage or is it auspicious and inauspicious? - Losing or getting things in planets about Taata - Losing gold is not auspicious but it is auspicious to get - it is not auspicious to lose a glass or a handkerchief but it is auspicious to get it - losing clothes is not auspicious, it indicates a disease - Losing of gems It is good duniya ke sabase khatarnaak yudhakshetra afghanistan main pichley 18 saal se gorilla jang lard rahe america or afgaan taliban ke bich katar main jari nauven daur kii baatcheet par puri duniya kii nazren hai
 The special thing is that neither Afghanistan's government nor India is involved in many campaigns for the development of peace and development
 iskaa kaaran he america ke saath vaarta main taliban kaa shaamil hona or pakistan or china kii is baatcheet main ati sakriyata
 But the interest of the Afghan people and for those who want peace in the country, this situation is also indicating the imminent danger
 vaarta kii jaldbaaji main trump!afgaan vaarta main shanti kii jatil sharton se zyada duniya is baat ko lekar utsuk he ki america jis taliban ko aatanki ghoshit kar 2001 ke 9 / 11 hamalon ke baad se jang lard rahaa he usee taliban se uski baatcheet kis had tak safal ho paaegi
 Trump wants to fulfill his electoral promise to the American people by withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan soon, but after the withdrawal of US troops, there are efforts to negotiate with the Taliban to ensure that there is no more chaos in Afghanistan
 iske liye 8 daur kii baatcheet ho chuki he or katar main nauven daur kii baatcheet jari he
 Know who are the negotiators are negotiating on behalf of America, the afghan-american diplomat Jalmi Khalilzad and the 14-member team from the Taliban are involved in this dialogue
 taliban ke vaartakaron kaa netaa he mullah abdul gani baradar
 Baradar has been close to Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar and is considered the Taliban's founder and number two
 taliban kii is team main hakkaani gut ke netaa kaa bhai anas hakkaani bhi he
 The team of negotiators also includes 5 former Taliban fighters in Cuba's notorious Guantanamo Bay prison
 jinhen america sargent kii rihaai ke badale 2014 main taliban ne america se chhudaaya tha
 By bringing former Taliban fighters to the negotiating table, the US is trying to find a way to peace and to get rid of the 18-year-old Afghan dispute as quickly as possible
 rus or china is vaarta ko safal banane ke liye alag se koshishen kar rahe hai
 The US is also expecting a lot from Pakistan to make this dialogue a success because it knows that Pakistan has a direct role in building, raising and protecting the Taliban
 koun he taliban kaa mukhya vaartakar mullah baradar?taliban kaa pramukh vaartakar mullah abdul gani baradar taliban ke sansthaapakon main se ek he or uskaa sanghathan ke logon par acha khaasaa prabhaav mana jaataa he
 He was a close associate of Osama bin Laden before the 9 / 11 terror attacks in the US
 1994 main taliban kii sthapana main usne mullah umr ke saath kaam kiya tha
 Baradar was believed to be the second number after Taliban chief Mullah Omar
 2001 main taliban sarkaar ke girane tak vah afghanistan main kai padon par rahaa tha
 Mulla Abdul Gani Baradar was arrested in 2010 from Karachi city of Pakistan under a secret operation by ISI and CIA
 2018 tak vah jail main hi rahaa
 But the US got him released for talks
 tabase vah katar main taliban ke rajanyik daftar ko chalaata he
 What are the demands of both sides? The main demand of the Taliban in this dialogue is that foreign security forces should be moved out of Afghanistan
 taliban se uski is maang ke badale america yah aashwaasan chahta he ki vah afghanistan kii dharti ko aatankwaadiyon ke adde ke rup main istemaal nahin hone degaa
 Especially organizations like Al Qaeda and ISIS will not be promoted there
 iske alaava donon ore se kaidiyon kii adla-badali kii jaaegi or kuch taliban netaaon par lagaaya gaya travel bain bhi hataaya ja saktaa he
 However, this also pertains to the ongoing differences between the Afghan government and Pakistan
 darasal afghanistan pakistan par talibani or hakkaani network ke aatankwaadiyon ko apane yahaan surakshit panaah dene kaa aarope lagaataa rahaa he
 For the US, the situation is like walking on a double-edged sword
 Now, more than 20,000 troops of NATO countries are deployed in Afghanistan
 jinamein se adhikansh america sainik hai
 Apart from counter-terrorism operations, they are involved in training, technical assistance and strategic preparedness of Afghan soldiers
 duusari ore rajdhani kabul ko chhod den to afghanistan ke ek bade hisse main aaj taliban ke guton kaa acha khaasaa niyantran he
 There are two big challenges for America
 ek taraf jahaan america sainikon kii vaapasi karaani he to sitambar main hone vaale afgaan raashtrapati kaa chunaav bhi shantipurvak sampann karana he
 After the withdrawal of foreign troops, there is a danger of different factions of the Taliban not again joining the guerrilla war
 kya hasil hua america ko afgaan war se2001 main 9 / 11 ke hamale ke baad america ne afgaan main taliban or alqaida ke khilaaf jang chhedi thi
 Since then America has spent a trillion dollars there
 america ab afgaan war main apane sainikon ke janmaal kaa or nuksaan nahin chahta he
 Last week, two American soldiers died in an attack
 is saal abtak america ko afgaan war main 14 sainikon kii jaan kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa he
 Now Trump wants to bring American troops back from there as soon as possible
 lekin visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki america or taliban ke bich kisi samjhaute maatr se afghanistan main shanti nahin aegi balki taliban ko america samarthit afghanistan kii sarkaar ke saath bhi baatcheet kar koi sahmati banani hogi
 What is there about the Taliban? There is little hope from fearlessness, so there is more doubt about the future of the Taliban
 taliban ne ye sandesh baar baar diya he ki wo kahin bhi hamalaa kar saktaa he, afghanistan kii jameen ke ek bade hisse par uskaa niyantran he or uske bagaiyr koi raajnneetik samaadhaan nahin ho saktaa
 If the Taliban becomes a shareholder in power after the departure of America, then the implementation of the Taliban's radical Islamic agenda will again promote fundamentalism in the region
 kyonki satta main aane ke baad taliban ko rokane vaala koi nahin hoga
 And before 2001, the Taliban showed a glimpse of its brutal and staunch regime in Afghanistan
 aaj bharat kii aadhunik pariyojnaon ke kaaran afghanistan phir aadhuniktaa ke raste par chal padaa he
 The fundamentalism of Taliban and Pakistan should not become an obstacle in the way of progress of Afghan people
 taliban or pakistan ko lekar bharat kii mukhya chintaaen2001 main jab se afgaan war chhidaa he bharat ne vahaan vikaas or punarutthan ke liye kai pariyojnaayen shuru kii hai
 India has invested more than $ 4 billion for the development of Afghanistan
 afgaan sansad kaa punarnirmaan, salama baandh kaa nirmaan, jaranj delarum sadak nirmaan, garland rajmarg ke nirmaan main sahyog, bamiyaan se bandar-eabbaas tak sadak nirmaan, kabul cricket stadium kaa nirmaan karaayaa he to 4 mig-25 atake helicopter die hai
 India is also training Afghan Defense Forces
 afghanistan ko kattarpanth kii raah par na le jaae talibanbharat kii chintaa pakistan ke saath samrik halaat or videshi sainikon ke jane ke baad afghanistan main apni vikaas pariyojnaon or nivesh kii suraksha ko lekar he
 India does not recognize the Taliban and has been saying that the Taliban cannot get out of its staunch agenda
 aise main kahin phir pakistan-taliban kii jugalbandi afghanistan kii dharti kaa istemaal bharat virdohi gatividhiyon ke liye na karne lagen
 India is also cautious about China, apart from this, if the influence of Pakistan and China increases in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of America, then it will be a situation of increasing concern for India
 pakistan taliban par apane prabhaav kaa istemaal kar afghanistan ko china ke van belt van road pariyojna se jodne kii koshish karegaa jo ki bharat ke aarthik or samrik hiton ke liye khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kalraj Mishra said on Sunday that if Congress's performance in Uttar Pradesh elections deteriorates, the blame should be laid on Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi
 mishra ne ek tivi news channel se baatcheet main kaha, 'congress ne yah kahana shuru kar diya he ki uski haar ke liye rahul gandhi jimmedaar nahin honge

 unhone kaha, 'congress netaa samay-samay par virodhabhasi bayaan de rahe hai

 a case of sexual harassment from a foreign student at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) has come to light
 emb department kii iran kii research scollar kaa aarope he ki uniwarsity kaa ek professor use watsapp par ashleel massej bhej rahaa he
 The special thing is that after the complaint of the student, where the AMU is trying to suppress the arrangement, the student is also being threatened
 jaankaree ke mutabik, chaatra kii ore se kii gai shikaayat main kaha gaya he ki jis professor ke under main vah piechdi kar rahi he, vahi professor pichley kuch dinon se use watsapp massenger ke jariye kuch aise massej bhej rahaa he, jo aapattijanak hai

 susheel modi ne jediu par votbank kii raajnneeti kii vajah se is mudde par chup rahane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 In response, JDU says that they do not take credit for every minor issue
 susheel modi ne twit kiya, 'ishrat jahaan ko beti bataane vaali jediu party yaccin bhatkal ko bihar kaa damaad bhi ghoshit kar sakati he (kyonki uski shaadi samastipur main hui he)'
 It is worth noting that the political attacks started by Sushil Modi on Thursday itself
 unhone twit kiya tha, 'chote aparaadhiyon ko giraftaar karne kaa shrey lene vaali bihar police yaccin bhatkal kii giraftaar kaa shrey kyon nahin le rahi he? kya yah vot bank kii raajnneeti kii vajah se he?'susheel modi ne hamalaa bolaa to jawaab jediu kii taraf se bhi aayaa
 JDU Spokesperson Ajay Alok accused Sushil Modi of doing inferior politics and said that BJP is doing politics on the basis of religion
 ajay alok ne kaha, 'susheel modi raajnneetik rup se diwalia ho gayi hai
 Modi is doing cheap politics
 hamaari apni peeth naa thapthapaane kii vajah votbank kii raajnneeti nahin he
 Instead, BJP is trying to mix politics and religion

 "he said," Bihar Police has questioned Yasin Bhatkal in connection with the Bodh Gaya blasts

 The truth is that Bhatkal would not have been arrested without the help of Bihar Police
 'haalanki jediu pravaktaa ajay alok ne ek chaunkaane vaali baat bhi kahi
 They said, why should we take credit? We were doing our duty
 hamen har choti baat ke liye shrey leni kii aadat nahin he
 The reason for this is not vote bank politics

 anjali kaa cameraa phulon se sajaa hua he or mobile janmdin ke shubhakamana sandeshon se bharaa padaa he
 But after only 72 hours of this happy day, the picture of this room changed in Fortune Galori, Shahpura, Bhopal
 guldaan main rakhe phool puri tarah suukh pate isse pehle hi anjali ne apni jindagi ko alavida kah diya
 Anjali, a former flying officer of the Air Force who dreamed of measuring the sky, hanged herself from a fan
 saaye kii tarah saath chalane vaale vivaadon ne antim kshanon main bhi unka saath nahin choda, ve apane peeche chhod gai group captain amit gupta ke saath apane bemail rishton kii daastaan or dukhi hokar thukraai gai jindagi
 Shahpura police arrested 49-year-old Group Captain Amit posted in Nagpur on charges of abetting Anjali for suicide under Section 306
 bataaya jaataa he ki amit ke saath anjali pichley kareeb aath saal se liv in relationships main thim, yani donon bagaiyr shaadi ke saath rah rahe the
 Anjali committed suicide at Gupta's house in Bhopal
 vaayu sena kaa chaar sadasyeey dal wing commander ares nakel tathaa sargent officer baalia ke netritv main bhopal pahunchaa, jisane shahpura thane main captain gupta se lambii poochtacha kii or iske baad police ne unhen aupcharik taur par giraftaar kar liya
 Actually Amit's initial statements have been contradictory
 unke mutabik ghatana ke dauraan ve bhopal se baahar the lekin pataa chalaa he ki anjali ke aatmahatya karne se pehle hi ve bhopal pahunch chuke the
 Anjali's short postmortem report also states that the incident was kept under control for 18 hours
 anjali bhartiya vaayu sena kii vah pehali mahila adhikari thim jinka court marshall hua tha
 In February 2005, Anjali, who was in charge of testing systems for aircraft systems at the Airforce station in Bangalore, had made serious allegations like physical torture, attempted defacement of three senior officers in February 2005, following which the Air Force had launched an indiscipline and economic mess against Anjali
 He took action on the court martial in the charge and on 8 December 2005, convicted him on five points
 Dismissed not
 unki barkhaastagi ke kisse pakistan kii surkhiyaan bane
 The website of the Pakistan think tank there ran stories like physical torture in the Indian Army
 natijatan anjali ko vaayu sena ke ek varg se milane vaali sahanubhuti bhi jaati rahi
 Through controversy and mental stress, Anjali came close to her senior officer married Captain Gupta
 isse unki patni unase alag rahane lagi or ve or anjali liv in sambandh main rahane lage
 Anjali's family alleges that it is Gupta who ends her career and now her life, it is because of her that Anjali took the matter to the police
 anjali kii bahan alka garg ne police ko bataaya he ki gupta ne anjali ko prem ke jhanse main lekar vaada kiya tha ki patni se talaak lekar ve usase shaadi karenge lekin aath saal bitne ke baavjood shaadi nahin kii
 CSP Rajesh Bhadoria, who is investigating the case, says that Anjali's death is a case of a failed live-in relationship
 anjali in dinon bangaloru kii kisi nijee company main kaam kar rahi thim
 When she reached Bhopal, Amit went to Delhi to attend a family function, she told the police that when she returned, she noticed that Anjali was in her room and the doors were closed so she moved to her in-laws in Arera Colony
 or ravivaar subah jab ghar laute to dekha ki anjali ne pankhe se latak kar jaan de di he
 The police have also found two poles filled with petrol in Anjali's room
 isse lagata he ki shaayad vah aag lagaakar jaan dena chaahati thi lekin baad main usne faansee laga lee
 The Air Force, however, suspended Captain Gupta from service under the Air Force Act

 a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court has delivered a major verdict giving relief to the leaders
 court ne kaha he kisaansadaur vidhayakon ko bataur vakil court main practice karne se nahin roka ja saktaa, kyonki rajaneta koi purnakalik karmchaaree nahin hai
 This decision has come in the way of rejecting the plea which sought to ban the conduct of the leaders

 Years later, in the current budget session of the Bihar Legislature, the parties and the opposition were seen openly debating every issue and giving advice to each other
 aise hi ghatnakram main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne congress ke vidhaan parshad prem chand mishra ko kuch din gaanv main guzaarane kii salaah de daali
 Actually, Prem Chand Mishra, citing some states, demanded to increase social security pension from Rs 400 to Rs 1000
 haalanki is mudde par bihar vidhansabha main nitish kumaar bhi safaai de chuke the, lekin phir bhi unhone bataaya ki saathiyon jin haryana, tamilnadu, telugana or andhra pradesh kaa udhaaharan diya ja he ye desh ke viksit rajyon main se ek hai
 Nitish Kumar further said, it is wrong to compare Bihar, because Bihar still has per capita income now much lower than these states
 unhone kaha ki vivaahit sammaan yojana he or iske labhaarthiyon ko inaki sankhya qareeb 36 lakh kii hogi
 This money has started going to his account, but then he pointed to Premchand Mishra and said that you have spent more time in politics in Delhi, so you do not know that much about the village and economy of Bihar
 kyonki bihar lo costiconomi he or yahaan jivan yaapan karne ke liye bahut adhik paise kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Then he advised Mishra to spend a few days in the village of Bihar as well
 2019 kii bahupratikshit film manikarnika: da queen of jhaansi shuru se hi sawaalon ke ghere main he
 In this film, Kangana Ranaut is playing the character of Rani Laxmibai
 pichley dinon karani sena ne film kaa ye kahkar virodh kiya tha ki isamen lakshmibai kaa ek british afasar sang dance dikhaaya gaya he
 The Sarva Brahmin Mahasabha of Rajasthan also made similar allegations
 haalanki ab vivaad shant hai, lekin in aaropon ke shuruyaat kii ek vajah he
 The reason is a book written on the life of Lakshmibai, which contains many such facts which are not prevalent about the queen of Jhansi
 kitaab kaa naam he rani, jise jayshri mishra ne likhaa he
 By the way, the story of Manikarnika is written by KV Vijayendra Prasad, writer of Bahubali
 unhone kin tathyon or kitabon ko aadhaar banaaya he, isaki jaankaree nahin he
 Only after the release of the film will it be known how different the film is from the popular story of Rani of Jhansi? Traditional books written in history do not mention any love affair of Laxmibai
 lekin 2018 main ai euke besd lekhika jayshri ne apni kitaab 'rani' main aise vivaadit prem prasang kaa ullekh kiya he
 However, Jayashree has described her book as a historical fiction and love story
 lekin lakshmibai ke bare main vivaadit tathyon kii vajah se unhen virodh kaa saamana bhi karnaa padaa tha

 Referring to the love story of the two, it is mentioned that Robert Ellis' complaint reached the East India Company due to the growing friendship with Laxmibai

 Before the start of the Test series, the Australian team management seemed confident that their biggest threat was from the Indian spinners
 lekin pehle din bhartiya pes-king umesh yadav ne mehmaan team kii qamar tod di
 After the success of the first day, Umesh gave credit to coach Anil Kumble and team management
 umesh kehete hai, "mujhe lagata he maine jo pichley chah maheene sanjay bhai (sanjay bangad) or anil bhai (anil kumble) ke saath mehnat kii usee kaa nateeja mil rahaa he
 On such a pitch, a plan has been made with Sanjay Bhai and Anil Bhai to put the ball on a line length which has less scope for bad ball or boundary ball
 " 2 on the turning track
 66 kii iconmi ke saath gendbaazi karne vaale umesh kehete hai ki david warner ke kilaaf gendbaazi karte vakt unhen gend thodi der se mili
 But the ball was doing the reverse and his plan was not to allow Warner to open the bat as well as keep the length ball
 unki ye tarkeeb kaam ai or warner jaise khataranaak ballebaaz 77 gendon par 38 ran banaakar out ho gaye
 Riddhiman Saha catches in the air behind a wicket by Umesh Yadav
 
 Probably the most spectacular picture of the first day's game

 Umesh praised Saha for this catch after the match

 jis pich par mana ja rahaa tha ki spinners apana jalawaa bikherenge vahaan umesh yadav ne hi mehmaan pari main send lagaai
 David Warner, appearing in dangerous form in the season, became the first victim in Umesh's innings, while Umesh took four wickets in the innings with the wicket of keeper Matthew Wade
 ullekhneey he ki 28waan test khel rahe umesh yadav ne test kii ek pari main 5 wicket lene kaa karnama sirf ek baar kiya he
 5 years ago in Perth Test against Australia
 29 saal ke umesh ko beshak superstar kaa darja nahin hasil ho, lekin duniya ke har kone main unhone kamyaabi zarur hasil kii he
 In 2012, Umesh took 5 wickets for 93 runs and Pune, 2017, has 4 wickets for 32 runs so far
 tippaniyan In North Sound, 2016, he took 4 wickets for 41 against the West Indies, while in Melbourne, 2011, he took 4 wickets for 70 against Australia
 kolkata, 2011 main west indies ke kilaaf 80 ran dekar 4 wicket lene kaa bhi karnama kiya he
 Umesh, who bowled with an economy of less than 3 on the first day, still has a chance to take 5 wickets in this innings
 lekin team ke liye pehali pari main wo apana role bakhubi adaa kar chuke hai

 sizan main khataranaak form main dikh rahe david warner umesh kii pari main pehla shikaar bane to wicket keeper mathew vade kaa wicket lekar umesh ne pari main chaar wicket apane naam kar liye
 It is worth mentioning that Umesh Yadav, playing the 28th Test, has done only once to take 5 wickets in an innings of the Test
 5 saal pehle australia ke hi kilaaf perth test main
 Umesh, 29, may not have the status of superstar, but he has achieved success in every corner of the world
 perth, 2012 main umesh ne 93 ran dekar 5 wicket jatke to pune, 2017 main ab tak unke naam 32 ran dekar 4 wicket hai
 The comments north sound, 2016 main unhone west indies ke kilaaf 41 ran dekar 4 wicket jatke to melbern, 2011 main australia ke kilaaf wo 70 ran dekar 4 wicket jhatak chuke hai
 In 2011, Kolkata also took 4 wickets for 80 runs against the West Indies
 pehle din 3 se kam kii iconmi ke saath gendbaazi karne vaale umesh ke paas ab bhi is pari main 5 wicket lene kaa mauqaa he

 madhya pradesh main pyaaj ab kisaanon ke aansu nikaal rahi he
 Due to bumper yields, farmers are not getting fair price in the mandis, from above, the government stopped buying onions, then tears started coming from the eyes of the farmers
 aise main 28 november ko hone vaale matdaan main madhya pradesh ke kisaan shivaraj sarkaar ko bhi pyaaj ke aansu rula sakate hai
 Due to crop failure or bumper yields, farmers are bringing hundreds of thousands of quintals of onion and garlic to the mandi from the districts around Behalchandwada
 is baar pyaaj or lahasun kii banpar fasal hui he lekin kisaan tab bhi ro rahaa he
 When the weather kills the crop, it still suffers losses
 ab zyada paidaavaar he to is baar mandi main keemat hi nahin mil rahi he
 The government is not buying onions, so the farmers of Chhindwara are with the help of middlemen and contractors
 sarkaar kii berukhi se kheti chhod denge kisaanramkumar aise hi kisaan hai jo 2000 kilo pyaaj mandi main lekar aae hai, ajtak se baatcheet menkisanram kumaar ne kaha, pyaaj kii keemat 608 rupee prati kilo tak gir gai he, aise main fasal kaa kharch mehnat or aane-jane kaa kharch mila len to phaayde ke naam par kuch nahin bachataa
 There are many people in the mandi like Ram Kumar, who say that farmers will leave the farmers due to the government's callousness and falling prices
 ram kumaar kehete hai ki agar aisi sthiti rahi to ham kheti kaise karenge
 The government plans increased production, although Vijay Wagdi, president of Mandi in Chhindwara city, said that this year the price has come down due to higher production
 mandi ke adhyaksh kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kii yojanaon ke chalate kisaan ko 24 ghante bijli mil rahi he, isliye banpar utpaadan ho rahaa he or agar utpaadan zyada hoga to keemat giregi
 Kisan Sushil Kumar can form Congress government in the state, says Kishivraj Singh Chauhan did a good job in Madhya Pradesh but there is such anger among farmers about many issues
 jiske chalate is baar kisaan badlaav ke liye bhi vot daal sakate hai
 He says that Congress has made several announcements along with loan waiver of farmers
 aise main kisaan is baar madhya pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav main parivartan kar sakate hai
 But he also warns that if the Congress does not fulfill the promise made to the farmers, then after 4 months, the farmers will defeat the Congress badly in the Lok Sabha elections
 makka kii fasal par sarkaar kaa bonussirf pyaaj hi nahin chhindwara main is baar makka kii bhi banpar paidaavaar hui he
 Chhindwara is also known as Corn City
 chhindwara kii mandi main hajaaron boriyaan faili hai, paidaavaar itani he ki mandi main rakhane ke liye jagah bhi nahin he
 The government is also not buying maize, so farmers are sitting only with the help of contractors and Seths coming from other states
 haalanki shivaraj sarkaar dwaara makka par 500 rupee prati quintal kaa atirikt bonus yaa bhavantar kii yojana kaa phayda kisaanon ko mil rahaa he
 Sushil Kumar is waiting to sell corn in the market for 2 days at the rate of Rs 200 per quintal
 kah rahe hai ki 100 rupee prati quintal kii keemat main kisaanon ko laagat bhi nahin milegi
 But due to the difference of Rs 500 per quintal by the government, losses are being avoided
 susheel kaa kahana he ki kisaan ke saath har baar yahi samasya he
 When the government is not buying, the contractors have to sell grain at one-quarter of the price
 lekin shivaraj sarkaar dwaara bhavantar die jane se nuksaan hone se batch gaya

 viraat behad khaas andaaj main boundry lagaate hai: ashvithasvin ne desh ho yaa phir videsh har jagah apni phiraki kaa jaadu dikhaaya he or wo chaar baar lagaataar main of da match siries bhi rahe
 Ashwin said that when Kohli scores a run chasing the target, then his batting is made on seeing that
 mohali vanade main jab ross tailor ne kohli kaa kaich choda, to uske kuch der baad hi wo apni half centuri laga chuke the
 This shows how fast they score while chasing the target
 viraat behad hi shandaar tareeke se boundry lagaate hai or unki running bitwin kaa da wicket bhi behad shandaar he
 Which sets him apart from other batsmen
 'viraat jaisaa koi nahin'aswin ne india today se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki bharat main kuch maidan aise hai

 Reduction in Kohli's aggression: Ashwin is commonly called Virat Kohli as an angry and extremely aggressive person
 lekin aisa nahin he wo duusari janareshan ke hai
 He has controlled his anger and aggression for some time
 kohli ne jab apana 26waan shatak lagayaa tab unhone iskaa jashn aaraam se manaaya or wo jab 150 par pahunche tab bhi unhone koi jashn nahin manaaya
 But there was happiness on his face that he gave Team India an easy win

 america jaanch agency epabiai ke sahyog se mumbai police pakistan ke jhooth kaa karegi pardaafash
 The Mumbai Police is finalizing its charge sheet for the biggest terrorist attack on the country's financial capital on November 26, but the case is stuck on evidence related to the Voice over Internet Protocol service
 ye ek aisa saboot ho saktaa he jo pakistan ke saare jhuuthon kaa pardaafash kar degaa
 This is the reason the Mumbai Police has sought help from the FBI in attaching evidence related to the voip service
 gauratlab he ki mumbai par hamalaa karne aae aatankwaadiyon or karachi main baithe inke aakaaon ke bich baatcheet main vioipi sarvice kaa istemaal hua tha
 Three Mumbai Police members - Deven Bharti, Arun Chauhan and Dinesh Kadam - are going to the US for the last week of this month to seek help from the FBI
 america jaanch agency vioipi or satellite ke kol detail kii jaanch main bhi madad karegi

 mumbai hamale kii jaanch main ab tak ye saamne aa chukaa he ki vioipi sarvice ke liye karachi se bhugtan kiya gaya tha
 According to PTI sources, with the help of the FBI, the Mumbai Police has come to know that an account was opened in Karachi through fake identity cards and $ 300 was paid through the Western Union Money Transfer Service for internet telephony
 vioipi number america ke orlando main liya gaya tha
 The Mumbai Police has also asked the FBI for call details of a satellite phone service operator based in the Gulf country, which the Mumbai Police had found with the terrorists
 gauratlab he ki mumbai hamale ke baad epabiai kii team jaanch ke liye mumbai pahunchi thi
 The team had many clues in this regard
 epabiai team ne internet telephoni ke code ko bhi tod diya tha
 The only surviving terrorist Mohammed Ajmal Kasab was also interrogated by the FBI
 mumbai police ne epabiai se kasaab se hui poochtacha kii report bhi maangi he
 Obviously, the fbi's help in filing the chargesheet for the Mumbai attack would prove to be effective for the Mumbai Police

 Actually these are the matches that were given by Hrithik to the cyber cell as a proof of this
 in mels main kangana kaa rithik ke liye pyaar ke izhaar hi kii baaten shaamil hai
 Although actress Kangnot's lawyer has called the e-mails handed over by Actorik Roshan out of context, unreliable and without investigation, Hrithik's lawyers have reacted to this questioning Kangana about the motive of their fight

 We have already given all the evidence in this case
 sach saamne aayega
 Hrithik's lawyer said, "they are trying to confuse the case, while it is a case of spreading falsehoods
" yadi unhone hamaare muvakkil rithik roshan ke liye 'sili eks' nahin kaha or agar vah kahana chaahate hai ki rithik kaa unke client se koi afaire nahin tha, to hamaare bich koi ladaai nahin he
 But they are putting things wrongly and we want to clarify the whole matter
 'kangana ke vakilrijwan siddhiki ne kaha, 'sandarbh se pare, avishwasaneey or bina jaachan kiye hue i mels ko media main failaa kar rithik ne sabit kiya he ki unhen nyaay pranali par bharosa nahin he or vah mere client kaa naam kharaab karne ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai

 'aapako bataan de ki khabaron ke mutabik, soshal media par li huin stars kii imail menkangana ritikke prati apane pyaar kaa izhaar kar rahi hai
 Even in the mail issued by Kangana, it is written on her behalf, 'if someday you tell me that you don't want me, then it will be the most painful reality of my life, which will make it difficult for me to recover
 ' haalanki kangana ke vakin ne in imels ko farji bataate hue in mels kii jaachan kii maang kii he

 Special moment: When the ordinance related to tainted mps was rubbish, if 2013 was an eventful event for the opposition camp, BJP made Narendra Modi more prime ministerial candidate like Congress and he grew up from the party
 On the other hand, the Congress also started the exercise to bring Rahul to the top
 128 saal puraani party ne janvari, 2013 main hue jaipur chintan shivi main 43 varshiya rahul ko party kaa upaadhyaksh bana diya
 Rahul, in his speech, emphasized the family's legacy rather than setting the future course for the party
 chunavi saal kii purv sandhya par ek aisi party ke liye jo lagbhag 10 saal se satta main he or jise desh kii maujuuda zyaadaatar samasyaon ke liye jimmedaar mana ja rahaa he, isse zyada chintaa kii baat or kuch nahin ho sakati thi
 Rahul said in Jaipur, "now is the time to question the centralized and irresponsible system of decision making in governance, administration and politics
" iskaa jawaab yah nahin he ki log kahen, vyavastha ko behatar dhang se chalaane kii jarurat he
 The answer is not to run the system better
 iskaa jawaab yah he ki vyavastha ko puri tarah badalane kii jarurat he
 "what they really wanted to say was not even understood by the Congress people present there
" rahul ne jab bataaya ki yah pad saunpane se pehle unki maa unke kamare main ain or rone lageen to vahaan maujuud chatukaaron kii ankhon se ganga-yamuna bahane lagi or ve rumal se apane aansu ponchhate najar aae
 Like any batsman running out-of-form, Rahul tried unsuccessfully to combine his vision with his legacy and the expectations of people outside the party
 rahul ne pichley saal apane bhaashanon se jo kuch kehane kii koshish kii, usase unka sandesh or bhi dhundhlata gaya, kyonki unki baton main spashtataa kii jagah amoortavaad hi najar aayaa
 He told industrialists at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) conference in April that "india is a beehive, and given the complexities here, merchants will enjoy more competition than the West
" ”soshal media main unke bhaashan kaa majaak udaate hue unhen # pappu qaraar diya gaya
 Modi said in a public meeting in Rajasthan, "rahul Gandhi says that India is a bee hive, but for us India is our mother
" ” or jab vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aae to janata ne saralata kii jagah rahul kii in jatil or aspasht baton ko nakaar diya
 Similarly, Rahul had said in October at the National Awareness Camp for Scheduled Castes in Delhi that the Jupiter's "escape velocity" is needed for the Dalit community to succeed and break out of the social fabric of oppression in India
 shaayad unhen pataa nahin ki escape velocity shabdaawalee kaa prayog aam taur par saamaajik utthan ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he
 But the context in which he used it could not be understood by the people
 rahul ne isi tarah kaa ek or udhaaharan us vakt pesh kiya jab unhone press club of india main party ke kaarykram main communication vibhaag ke pramukh ajay maakan ko ek taraf hataate hue ghoshnaa kii ki daagi saansadon ko chunaav main ayogy tehraane se bachaane ke liye upie sarkaar kaa prastaavit adhyadesh ''puri tarah bakawaas he or use fadkar phenk diya janaa chahie
 This is my personal opinion
 ” lekin unki is bebaaki kaa matadaataaon par koi asar nahin hua
 Now the results of the assembly elections may have pushed them to show some tax
 21 disambar ko fikki kii baithak main unhone kaha, ''main apni baat yah sweekaar karne ke saath shuru karnaa chahta hum ki mere pichhali timahi ke nattejey bahut achche nahin rahe hai
 i know how you feel when you go to a meeting with bad news
 ”saal kaa ant rahul kii sweekaarokti ke saath hua he
 Time is short, in such a situation they will desperately need escape velocity for themselves

 Lalu said that Ram Jethmalani is not short of money, he also fought our case for free

 All this is taken by Arun Jaitley, who is scared of my cross-examination
 agar dilli sarkaar yaa vah (kejariwal) pement nahin karte hai to main unhen ek garib client samajhuunga
 BJP had alleged that BJP had accused Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal that they are trying to pay legal expenses from the state exchequer in the criminal defamation case filed by Arun Jaitley
 kitna bill kejariwal ko bharna he?is sambandh main dilli sarkaar ne leftinent governenil baijal ko khat likhakar arvind kejariwal ke khilaaf arun jetali dwaara darj karaae gaye manahani cese main kanoonee kharchon ke bill kaa bhugtan karaane ko kaha he
 The letter written by the Delhi government to LG has been released by BJP spokesperson Tejendra Bagga on Twitter, including 3
 86 karod rupee ke kanoonee kharch ke bill kaa bhugtan karaane ko kaha gaya he
 What is the matter? Actually Arvind Kejriwal had accused Arun Jaitley of corruption in Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA)
 jetali saal 2013 tak didisie ke adhyaksh the
 He held this position for 13 years
 aaropon ke khilaaf jetali adaalat gaye or kejariwal ke khilaaf 10 karod rupee kaa manahani daawa kiya
 Apart from this, he has also filed a case of criminal defamation in the same case in Patiala House Court
 srilanka ke khilaaf tisare vanade main shandaar pradarshan karne vaale bhartiya gendbaaj jasprit bumraah ne vipakshi team ke gendbaaj se sikhkar hi apane kariyar ko or nikhaarane ke kaam kiya he
 Fast bowler Bumrah, who was the best performer of his career, said after the victory in Pallekel ODI that in every new match, he comes down to the ground to learn something new
 srilanka ke khilaaf tisare vanade match main 27 ran dekar 5 wicket lene vaale bumraah ne kaha ki unhone mumbai indians kii taraf se khelte hue srilanka ke tej gendbaaj lasit malinga se kaaphi kuch siikhaa
 Bumrah, who played a key role in India's 6-wicket win, said that he has come to Sri Lanka for the first time and has never played here before, so playing under different circumstances is always a big challenge
 pallecol vanade ke main of da match bumraah ne kaha ki vah apane senior khilaadiyon se hameshaa kuch nayaa sikhte aae hai

 unhone kaha kimalinga jaise gendbaajon ke niyamit sampark menrahane se bhi ek tej gendbaaj ke rup main aage badhane main unhen kaaphi madad mili he
 Bumrah said that he is with Mumbai Indian when he was 19 in 2013
 tab vah kaaphi yuva the jisane pratham shrenee cricket bhi nahin kheli thi, isliye malinga se baat karnaa or unase siikhnaa bumraah ke liye bahut upyogi rahaa

 unka saaf kahana tha ki jo bhi gyaan aap praapt karte ho vah bahut mahatvapurn hota he
 Old age is not a barrier to fitness
 Healthier than before
 American can become a person over 70 years of age
 US President In 2016, when Donald Trump became the President of America, he was 70 years old
 khaas baat yah thi ki unhone america ke sabase umradraj raashtrapati banane kaa khitaab hasil kar liya
 According to a research study, once again there is a coincidence that any leader who is more than 70 years old can become the President of America
 research ke mutabik pehle kii tulana main ab log adhik vakt tak jite hai
 The average cases of healthy people have also increased, so the President's age is not a challenge to his fitness
 shodhakartaaon ne paaya he ki desh ke sabase ucch pad ke liye raashtrapati kii ummidavaari tay karne ke liye umr koi praasangik kaarak nahin he, kyonki umr bas ek 'sankhya maatr' hi he
 The study's author and S
 Joy Olshanowski of the University of Illinois said that this study speaks of science-based calculations for the first time that a candidate's age will not be considered at all
 shodhakartaaon ke anusaar varsh 2020 main hone vaale america raashtrapati ke chunaav main bhaag lene vaale democratic or republican donon dalon ke chaar sabase aage chal rahe ummidavaaron kii umr 70 yaa isse adhik he
 Among them, American MP Joy Biden is 76, Bernie Sanders is 77 and Ellijoth Warren is 70 years old
 ye teenon bhavi ummidavaar democratic party ke hai
 Republican candidate and current President Donald Trump is 73 years old
 iske saath hi kul milakar dekhen to raashtrapati ke chunaav main shaamil 27 main se 7 ummidavaaron kii umr janvari 2021 main 70 saal yaa isse adhik hogi
 In January 2021, the next President of America will take over
 aise main is baat kii sambhaavna bad jaati he ki us din sabase adhik vruddh vyakti raashtrapati pad kii shapath le
 Earlier, in June 2019, four out of 10 people in the survey said that anyone is over 70 years of age for the post of President
 lekin adhyayan ke anusaar raashtrapati banane ke liye adhik umr ko ek maatr ayogyata ke rup main sweekaar nahin kiya jayega
 (with IANS input) desh ke har chunaav main kisaanon or vyapaariyon kaa mudda hameshaa bana rahata he, har raajnneetik dal lagaataar in donon virgon kii sthitiyon main sudhaar kii baat karte rahete hai
 BJP and Congress, the country's 2 largest parties, try to get a large number of votes from these sections
 modi sarkaar ne 2022 tak kisaanon kii aay doguni karne kaa vaada kiya he to congress ne kisaanon ke liye alag se bajet taiyaar karne kii baat kahi he
 The Congress is also considering a proposal to introduce a single digit GST to woo businessmen
 chunavi ghoshnaa patr or surkhiyon main bane rahane ke saath-saath kisaan or bijnesaman 17veen loksabhaa ke liye ho rahe chunaav main ek anya maamle main sheersh par bane hue hai
 The largest number of candidates trying their luck in the 2019 general elections are from these 2 classes farmers and businessmen
 yani is baar kul ummidavaaron main sabase zyada ummidavaar kisaan or bijnesaman hi hai
 24% of the candidates related to farming, Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR), Ashok University's Triveni Center for Political Data (TCPD) and India Today's Data Intelligence Unit (DIU), found in their research that 24% of the total candidates 'farming'
 Linked with that
 is loksabhaa chunaav ke ummidavaaron kii ore se daakhil halafnaamon ke anusaar 24 fisadi ummidavaaron ne apana pesha krishi se sambandhit bataaya
 Apart from agriculture, 17 percent of the candidates have declared their occupation as 'business'
 iske baad 'soshal work' (7
 3 per cent), 'advocate' (5
 4 fisadi), 'naukari' (4
 2 per cent) and daily laborers (3
 5 fisadi) se jude ummidavaar apni kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 In addition, 200 candidates (3 per cent) in their affidavits described themselves as 'unemployed'
 chunaav ladane waalon main ritair logon kii bhi badi sankhya he
 About 300 (4
 2 fisadi) ummidavaaron ne apane pesha states main khud ko ritred bataaya
 Major change in democracy Dr
 Giles Vernier, co-director of TCPD and assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University, said that the background of most candidates is related to farming
 aitihaasik rup se baat karen to pehle aadhe se zyada ummidavaaron kii pesha kheti se sambandhit hua karata tha, lekin ab yah ghatakar ek chauthai ho gaya he
 This is a big change
 doctor gills varneer kehete hai ki log ab bijness se jud rahe hai jo ki saamaajik, aarthik or raajnneetik str par bade badlaav kaa suchak he
 In order to win the elections in the first round, the candidates needed 3 things, first the caste status, land and Congress ticket
 lekin ab aapako apni jati kii sankhya, paisa (zyaadaatar bijness se jude log paise kii vyavastha karte hai) or badi party kii ore se tikat
 The importance of the land is still there, but has decreased slightly before
 doctor gills varneer ke anusaar, jaise-jaise adhik se adhik kaarobaari chunaav ladane lage hai chunaav bhi adhik kharchila hota ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, if anyone else wants to enter politics, the road has become more difficult for him
 varneer kehete hai, ‘kaarobaariyon ke liye raajnneeti main pravesh kaa baari kharch uthaanaa auron kii tulana main aasaan rahata he
 Any economic activity other than agriculture usually gives more profits, so it is not surprising that the number of businessmen is increasing in politics
 unke liye raajnneeti main nivesh ke liye kai baaten rasta aasaan karti hai jaise ki darja, raajnneetik sampark, anubandhon or sansadhano tak pahunch, sarkaar se sangrakshan aadi aadi
 The meaning of coming into politics is often seen in relation to personal interests
 ’kisaanon ko bijepi se zyada tiktab baat karte hai ki raajnneetik dalon ke ummidavaaron ke bare main
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made the highest number of candidates related to agriculture
 khetihar samaaj se jude 70 logon ko bijepi ne tikat diya he
 After BJP, Congress has fielded 66, Bahujan Samaj Party 56, Progressive Samajwadi Party (lohia) 24, Bahujan Mukti Party 18 and Shiv Sena 15 candidates
 duusari ore, peshey ke aadhaar par phir se chunaav lard rahe saansadon kii baat karen to 85 ummidavaaron ne apana pesha 'kheti' bataaya, jabaki 39 ne raajnneeti, 30 ne soshal work, 28 ne bijness or 11 ne edwocket bataaya
 On the basis of the mercy of businessmen on Mayawati state, 32 percent of the total candidates trying their luck in Chhattisgarh described their profession as 'farming'
 jabaki anya rajyon main kheti se jude sarvaadhik ummidavaaron main telugana (23
 7 percent), Bihar (20
 45 fisadi), madhya pradesh (20
 32 percent), Uttar Pradesh (19
 6), rajasthan (18
 8 percent) and Jharkhand (18
 34 fisadi) se maidan main hai
 Most businessmen from the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party are trying their luck
 bispi ne 85 kaarobaariyon ko tikat diya he
 After this, BJP and Congress have fielded the highest number of 68-68 businessman candidates by giving them tickets
 gruhaniyaan bhi chunaav maidan mesub baat karte hai gruhaniyon kii
 There has been an increase in the number of 'housewives' who have beaten in the election season in the Lok Sabha elections
 diaiu ne apane research main paaya ki is baar 120 'gruhaniyon' ne apni daavedaari pesh kii he
 As 'housewives', the maximum number of candidates are from Tamil Nadu where 18 women have submitted their candidature, 16 in Uttar Pradesh, 15 in Maharashtra and 10 in Andhra Pradesh

 dilli main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ralike baad aam aadmi party (AAP) ne bijepi par palatwaar kiya he
 AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal not only 'counter-attacked' Modi at a press conference on Saturday, but also aired his claims made from the platform
 mahangaai kam hone kaa daawa kar rahe amit shah ko unhone subjiyon ke daam bataae, anaadhikrut coloniyon ko niyamit karne vaala adhyadesh dikhaane ko kaha, or to or bijli ke bill ghataane vaale 'bhaajapai balb' kii bhi chutki lee
 It is worth noting that in his rally at Ramlila Maidan, Narendra Modi not only named Kejriwal as a liar and anarchy, but also gave the advice to work with the Naxalites in the jungles
 iske kuch ghanton baad kejariwal media ke saamne aae or kaha ki bijepi ke paas koi mudda nahin bachaa he or ab vah nakaaratmakataa kii raajnneeti par utar ai he
 He said, 'modi ji called me a liar, anarchist and a sitter
 hamane kabhi vyaktigat tippanee nahin kii, hameshaa muddon kii raajnneeti kii
 Whoever i am, it doesn't matter
 main kam se kam karpt to nahin hum
 i had halved the electricity bills
 ' unhone kaha ki bijepi ke sab netaaon ne apane bhaashanon 49 din kii sarkaar ke khilaaf ek bhi shabd nahin bolaa
 That is, they indirectly believed that our work was good
 bijepi ke paas koi agenda nahin he isliye vyaktgat hamale par utar rahi he ; arvind kejariwal # delhiwithkejriwalpic
 twitter
 com / 8k0q1f1mtg— Aam Aadmi Party (@aamaadmiparty)january 10, 2015ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha, 'ham kisi ke vyaktitv par tippanee nahin karte
 The people of Delhi know what Kejriwal is
 unhone (modi ne) kaha ki kejariwal arajak he, kya isse bijli ke bill kam ho gaye? samasyaayein sulajh gayi? main jo bhi hum, maine bijli ke bill aadhe kar die the
 In the presence of party leaders like Yogendra Yadav, Ashutosh, Manish Sisodia and Ashish Khaitan, Kejriwal recalled the time of the agitation, saying, "this is the same Ramlila Maidan where Anna Hazare staged
 jahaan aazaadee ke baad shaayad aaj tak kaa sabase bada dharna hua tha
 Today the same dharna was mocked from the same Ramlila ground
 ' gauratlab he ki 2011 main anna hajaare or arvind kejariwal ke andolan kaa narendra modi ne bhi samarthan kiya tha
 He was then the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 lekin shanivaar kii raily main unhone kejariwal ko 'dharna master' kah daalaa
 'where did inflation fall, Amit Shah does not buy vegetables' Kejriwal dismissed the claims of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah one by one
 mahangaai ke mudde par unhone kaha, 'aaj amit shah ne kaha ki mahangaai kam ho gai he
 During our government, peas were available for Rs 15 a kg
 amit shah ko to sabji lene janaa nahin padataa
 i go, my wife, mother go
 ab matar 40 kii milti he
 Cabbage is now 60 rupees a kg
 pichley saal gaajar 10 rupee kilo thi, ab 50 rupee kilo he
 People's houses are not vegetables and you are making fun of them
 ''haryana sarkaar gata chuki he ritairement kii umr'kejariwal ne kaha ki anaadhikrut coloniyon ko niyamit karne kaa koi bill sarkaar ne paas nahin kiya he, lekin bijepi is bare main jhooth failaa rahi he
 He said, 'today was the opportunity, he would tell when the registry would start in these colonies and when the sewer line would be drained
 unhen sirf raajnneeti kerani aati he
 The biggest lie that government employees will not be reduced
 ye haryana sarkaar ke order kii copy he
 The retirement age of government employees in Haryana has been reduced to 58 years
 mukhyamantri khatter sahab bhi manch par maujuud the
 The central government is also sitting making such an order
 dilli ke karmchaaree sab jaanate hai, unki netwarking bahut acchhee he
 Kejriwal said, 'bulb hai or Shigufa' On the important electoral issue of power, Kejriwal said, 'there were elections in the country 6 months ago
 6 maheenon main unhone (bijepi) apana koi vaada puraa nahin kiya
 He promised to reduce the electricity tariff by 30 percent in Delhi
 lekin 6 maheene main to ulte do baar bijli ke daam badha die
 Took a U-turn, promised
 aaj ye nayaa shigupha laae hai ki unke paas koi skim he
 Have brought some bulbs, which will reduce the bill of Rs 300 in a year
 saal main 300 rupee, yani maheene main kareeb 25 rupee
 We are saying that electricity bills will be halved
 matlab kisi kaa bill 2000 kaa aata he to uskaa 1000 kaa ho jayega
 That is, now the people of Delhi have to decide whether to save 25 rupees a month or make the bill halved
 ''2022 chodo, ab kya karoge?'arvind kejariwal ne dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene kaa vaada bhi bijepi ko yaad dilaayaa
 He said, 'last time he promised to give full statehood to Delhi
 ham ek din pehle se unhen unka vaada yaad dilaa rahe hai
 But he did not pay any attention to it in his speech
 chunaav se pehle unhone ek bhi jhuggi na tuutane dene kaa vaada kiya tha
 But within the last 6 months, slums have been demolished one after another in Delhi
 vasant kunj, vajirpur or okhla main jhuggiyaan tuuti hai
 They have now brought a new shagufa that they will give houses to everyone by 2022
 to jo abhi beghar hue hai ve saat saal kya karenge
 Who has seen 2022, what will you do now? In Gujarat too, he promised to build 5 lakh houses, even 5000 houses were not built
 naaraa chal rahaa he, jab jab bhaajapa ai he, jhuggiyon par afat ai he
 "there is also picketing and governance"
 The AAP convenor retaliated one by one on all the verbal attacks of Modi
 bhrashtachar ke mudde par unhone kaha, 'bhrashtachar par modi bole ki piemo kii safai main hi saat maheene lag gaye
 It is now the turn of Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Officer, Assistant Officer
 phir aapaki gali kaa number kab aayega? hamane 49 din main rishwatakhori khatm kar di thi
 This was also said in the meeting of BJP councilors
 ab isaki do vajahen ho sakati hai ki yaa to inhen bhrashtachar kam karnaa nahin aata yaa inaki niyat kharaab he
 If you do not know how to do it, then tell us, we will teach
 hamen dharna dena bhi aata he or gavarnence bhi aati he
 "women are children of children?" Kejriwal also surrounded the central government on the pretext of women's safety issues and disrespect of BJP mps
 unhone kaha, 'pichhali baar unhone naaraa diya tha, 'bahut hua nari par waar, abaki baar modi sarkaar'

 The biggest partnership by wicket in 2010 in India's Twenty20 league
 wicketrankhiladeetimakhilaphmaidan1st129ravi bopaara, manvinder bisalaapunjababangalorebangalore Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met with Leader of the Opposition Aung San Suu Kyi and in this meeting he spoke to Myanmar, expressing India's full support for progress towards a transition to full democracy
 yangon main singh or su chi kii mulaakaat se pehle, videsh mantri es em krishna ne kaha ki su chi myamar ke mahatvapurn netaaon main se ek hai or pradhanmantri kaa sadbhaavnavash unase mulaakaat karnaa tathaa is desh kii loktantric prakriya ko samrudh karne ke liye rashtriya sulah sahmati kii khatir unhen hamaari shubhakamanaayen dena swaabhaavik he
 Asked what India's commitments could be to help the prosperity of democracy in Myanmar, Krishna said, "who can be the ones who make more commitments to the democratic process
" yah ek swatantra, samprabhu desh he jiske saath hamaare kootnithik or anya tarah ke sambandh hai
 Singh's meeting with 66-year-old Suu Kyi, who is educated in India and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, will take place a day after the Prime Minister talks to Myanmar President Thein Sein
 beete ek baras main myamar main raajnneetik sudhaaron kii pahal karne kaa shrey thine seen ko hi jaataa he
 Due to these reforms, the atmosphere in Myanmar has changed a lot, due to which Singh is meeting the leaders of the opposition in the political realm
 pichley kuch varsh ke dauraan purv raashtrapati e pi je abdul kalam or up raashtrapati hamid ansaari myamar aae the lekin tab vah najarband su chi se nahin mil paae the
 Singh's meeting with Suu Kyi is seen as a clear indication that New Delhi wants to strengthen its relationship with this democratic activist
 purv main use myamar ke purv sainya junta ke saath sambandhon ko lekar aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 New Delhi has always respected Suu Kyi, who is going to be 67 next month
 varsh 1993 main nayi dilli ne unhen pratishthit jawaharlal nehru award diya
 But the issue of security and energy and the increasing influence of China in Myanmar forced India to change its stand with which the military junta began its close proximity
 phir bharat ne 2004 main purv varisht general thaan shwe ko aadhikarik daure par aamantrit kiya
 According to sources, India has always refused to favor anyone in Myanmar's domestic political dispute and has made it clear to the leadership of this country that it is ready to work with any government
 singh or su chi ke bich mulaakaat aise samay par ho rahi he jab su chi kii chhavi sainya junta kaa virodh karne vaali netaa se badal kar loktantric desh kii ek raajnneetik ke taur par ban rahi he
 The change began on May 2 when Su Chi was sworn in as a Member of Parliament
 iske thik ek saptaah pehle hi unhone sena dwaara taiyaar samvidhan ke mutabik shapath lene se manaa kar diya tha jisase raajnneetik sankat khadaa ho gaya tha
 She wanted one word in the format of the oath-related statement to be changed
 baad main su chi ne apana iraadaa badla or sansad sadsy ke taur par shapath le lee
 This was another step in his struggle from political captives to a new phase of democracy in government
 varsh 1991 main nobel shanti puraskaar se sammanit kii gayi su chi ko do dashak se bhi adhik samay tak najarband rakhaa gaya or 2010 ke aakhir main reeha kiya gaya
 Then hardly anyone would have thought that she would become an officer in only 18 months from a militant leader of democracy
 tippaniyan His subsequent swearing without changing the word Suu Kyi wanted to change in the sworn statement clearly shows what challenges he faces in the future
 myama main ab bhi sena kaa hi prabhaav he or asainya sarkaar sena kii hi chhadam sarkaar he
 The government of President Thein Sein made several political reforms including the release of political prisoners, ceasefire with indigenous rebels, relaxation of media censorship and holding of parliamentary by-elections
 in up chunaavon ke kaaran hi su chi kii neshnal lig for demokrasi (eneldi) sansad main pahunch pai he
 Prior to Singh and Suu Kyi's meeting in Yangon, Foreign Minister SM Krishna said that Suu Kyi is one of Myanmar's important leaders and that the Prime Minister will meet in good faith and agree a national reconciliation to enrich the democratic process of this country It is only natural to wish them well
 yah puche jane par ki myamar main loktantr kii samruddhi main madad ke liye bharat kii kya patibaddhtaayen ho sakati hai, krishna ne kaha ‘‘loktantric prakriya ke liye or patibaddhtaayen jataane vaale ham koun ho sakate hai

 in sudhaaron ke kaaran myamar main maahaul bahut badla he jisaki badaulat hi singh raajnneetik daayre main vipaksh ke netaaon se mulaakaat kar rahe hai
 During the past few years, former President APJ Abdul Kalam and Vice President Hamid Ansari had come to Myanmar but could not meet the detained Suu Kyi then
 singh kii su chi se mulaakaat ko is baat kaa saaf sanket samajha ja rahaa he ki nayi dilli is loktantric kaaryakarta ke saath apane rishte majboot karnaa chaahati he
 It had previously faced criticism over Myanmar's ties with the former military junta

 The meeting between Singh and Suu Kyi is taking place at a time when Suu Kyi's image is changing from a leader opposing the military junta to a political one in a democratic country
 yah badlaav do may se shuru hua jab su chi ne sansad sadsy ke taur par shapath lee
 Just a week before this, he had refused to take oath as per the constitution prepared by the army, which created a political crisis
 vah chaahati thim ki shapath sambandhi bayaan ke praaroop ke ek shabd ko badla jaae
 Suu Chi later changed his mind and was sworn in as a Member of Parliament
 yah raajnneetik bandi se sarkaar main loktantr ke nae charan ke liye unke sangharsh kaa ek or kadam tha
 Sui Chi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, was placed under house arrest for more than two decades and released in late 2010

 " Indeed ! Sachin Tendulkar never forgets his friends

 In fact, Sachin shared a picture of his childhood on Instagram on Sunday
 jisamen vah apane dost ke saath khadey hai
 Also, Sachin has written- Atul Ranade! In this journey we were still friends, even today we are friends
 Friends then, friends now
 It's been a journey, Atul Ranade! # nostalgiaa post shared by Sachin Tendulkar (@sachintendulkar) onjun 25, 2017 at 1:14 am PDT Sachin ruled alone on a pitch of 22 yards in his 24-year cricket career, but he got some good friends off the field
 Who were known as 'sachin Gang'
 jisamen shaamil rahe kaaphi utsaahi atul ranade
 Both Sachin and Atul grew up in the Sahitya Sahwas Colony in Mumbai in the 1970s
 atul sachin se ek saal bade hai
 Although Atul, working in the Customs department, played only 6 first-class cricket matches, Sachin stayed with him in every joy and sorrow
 ek hi guru ramakant aachrekar se cricket ke shuruaati gur seekhney vaale atul or sachin ni:swaarth ek-duusare se jude rahe or vafaadaar bhi rahe
 The days when Sachin was struggling with the problem of tennis elbow, Atul did not leave him
 sachin ke liye vah daur kaaphi mushkil bharaa tha or kariyar khatm hone kaa dar tha
 Sachin first felt the most need of friends in 2005-06
 aise main unke doston ne choubison ghante unka saath nibhaayaa or motivet kiya
 Sachin also has a funny incident with Atul
 2011 kii baat he
 Sachin along with all his friends gathered in Mussoorie to celebrate Atul's birthday
 yahaan sachin ko ek sharaarat suujhi
 To teach Atul that he slept till late in the morning, Sachin put Amritanjan in his eyes
 jab atul kii neend khuli, to unki ankhon main jalan ho rahi thi, saath hi aansu bhi nikal rahe the
 Then Sachin took a laughter and took Atul to the bath room and reduced the effect of Amritanjan by applying Colgate

 Sundar Rajaram was lodged in Tihar Jail in the case of robbery 1 year ago
 The prisoner was admitted to Deendayal Upadhyay Hospital after the operation

 jail prashasan ko khabar mili ki sundar ke paas ek mobile he

 haalanki bataaya ja rahaa he ki abhi bhi ek micro sim or ek mini charger kaidi ke pet main hi he
 Prisoners in prison often smuggle mobile phones from outside and take them inside
 kai baar ek hi phone kai kaidiyon ke bich bant jaataa he
 In order to talk to relatives and family members in Tihar Jail, the prisoners have been given a phone arrangement by the jail administration
 ek kaidi sirf 5 minute hi apane parivaar se phone par baat kar saktaa he
 The number is first verified by the jail administration and then called

 Tihar Jail has about 16000 prisoners and often raids have mobile phones recovered from these prisoners
 lekin jis tarah se pet main phone milane kaa maamla saamne aayaa he usase sab hairaan hai
 Controversy queen Rakhi Sawant of the industry is once again in the news due to her impunity

 These days, there is a buzz in Odisha that Pinaki Mishra has become the Chief Minister's favorite person after Pyarimohan Mohapatra had a confrontation with Naveen Patnaik
 bijedy main vaise to ve nae hai lekin is prakhar vakil ne party main apni upasthiti darj karaane main jaraa bhi samay barbaad nahin kiya he
 He is often seen debating national issues on TV channels
 jahaan tak mahapaatr kii baat he, jo aadmi kabhi patnayak ke har kadam kii jaankaree rakhata tha aaj poochta he, koun patnayak? 14 agast ko jab ek patrkaar ne unase patnayak ke agle dinon main dilli aane ke kaarykram kii jaankaree chaahi to unka jawaab yahi tha
 Mahapatra was suspended from the BJD in June for plotting to remove Patnaik from the Chief Minister's post, so there is nothing surprising in this

 After demonetisation, there has been a decrease in circulation of fake Indian currency in the country
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne loksabhaa main yah jaankaree di he
 He said that this is indicated by the figures of the Reserve Bank of India and the seizure of fake notes (FICN) by national agencies and state police

 Justifying the demonetisation made by the Modi government on 8 November 2016, the Finance Minister said, 'by the beginning of 2019, there has been no seizure of 2000 or 500 high quality fake notes
 inase ab tak koi zyada nuksaan nahin hua he
 He said that the government has taken several steps to prevent smuggling and circulation of fake Indian currency in the country
 unhon kaha ki grih mantralay ke dwaara ek phek indian karency nots koordination group (FCORD) banaaya gaya he, taaki centre evam rajya kii suraksha agenciyon ke saath khufia jaankariyaan saajha kii ja saken
 He said, 'according to the agencies' report, many such instances have been seen when fake notes have come from neighboring countries through smuggling
 'isi prakaar neshnal investigation agency (NIA) main ek teror funding and phek karency cell (TFFC) banaaya gaya he taaki teror fundig or nakli noton ke maamalon ko dekha ja sake
 Significantly, according to the Reserve Bank of India data, 5 during FY 2017-18
 22 lakh nakli note pakade gaye
 31 compared to the year 2016-17 (the year when the demonetisation was announced)
 4 fisadi kam he
 About 3 of it
 34 lakh noton kii pahchaan bainkon ke dwaara, jabaki baaki noton kii pahchaan rigerv bank dwaara kii gai he
 In the year 2017-18, the identity of fake currency of 2000 increased by 28 times to 17,929
 notebandi se is phaayde kaa bhi kiya gaya tha daawanotbandi se pehle desh main seemapar se nakli karency ke pravaah kii gambhir samasya thi
 The fake currency that reached his hands had to suffer immediate loss of such value
 vahiin sarkaar ko bhi iske rokthaam ke liye bade network kaa sahaara lenaa padataa tha
 It was expected that the economy would be protected from fake currency for the next several years due to higher security standards of the new currency
