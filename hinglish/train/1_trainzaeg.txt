 Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday questioned the motive of Defense Minister Rajnath Singh's sudden departure to France to take the first Rafale fighter jet
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa netaaon ko vivaadaaspad saude main kii gayi galatiyon kaa aparadhbodh ho rahaa he
 Addressing an election rally in Mumbai's Chandivali assembly constituency, Rahul Gandhi also raised the issue of alleged fraud in Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank
 bank main hue farjivade kii vajah se logon ke rakam nikaalane par simit pabandi lagaayi gayi he
 He asked those present there that it seems that the Rafale deal is still troubling the BJP, if not, why did Rajnath Singh go to France to take the first fighter plane? In Chandivali, sitting Congress MLA Naseem Khan is pitted against Shiv Sena's Dilip Lande
 rahul gandhi ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv main hue rafel saude main aniyamittaaon kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 He said that BJP leaders have some guilt that they have made a mistake in the Rafale deal
 raksha adhikariyon ne bhi daawa kiya tha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi rafel ladaaku vimaan saude main dakhal de rahe hai
 No one can escape this truth, neither Narendra Modi, nor Amit Shah nor BJP
 ek din sach unhen pakadega
 He said that everyone knows that the Rafale deal was controversial and some bribes were paid
 sauda ab bhi (bhaajapa ko) pareshaan kar rahaa he
 Therefore, our Defense Minister went to France to take the first fighter aircraft
 ab tak koi bhi is tarah ladaaku vimaan lene aapurti karne vaale desh main nahin gaya tha
 On Tuesday, the Defense Minister took the first Rafale fighter aircraft from France on behalf of the Indian Air Force
 france main pehla ladaaku vimaan saunpe jane ke kaarykram main shaamil hue singh ne ise aitihaasik kshan bataaya tha or kaha tha ki isse bharat or france ke bich ranneetik saajhedaari badhegi
 Recently, France handed over the first Rafale aircraft to India

 Rahul alleged that the way the British divided and looted India before independence, the BJP is doing so
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki bhaajapa bharat ko baant or lut rahi he, jaisaa aazaadee ke pehle britain ke logon ne kiya tha
 Wherever BJP leaders go these days, they distribute and spread unrest
 bhaajapa par kuch corporate gharaanon ke paksh main kaam karne kaa aarope lagaate hue rahul ne kaha ki yah spasht ho gaya he ki ve bhi desh ko lut rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi said that there was a time when the US President used to say that the Indian economy can compete with the American economy
 ab koi nahin kahata
 He targeted him for the statement of Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in which he said that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) cannot be changed as it is a law passed by Parliament
 agar aap kanoon ke naam par jiesti main badlaav nahin kar sakate to mat bhoolen ki manaregaa bhi ek kanoon tha, jisamen aapane badlaav kiya
 The Food Security Act was also changed and you want to change the tribal law (to free their land holdings)
 yah thik nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi also referred to some "association" between some directors of PMC Bank and the ruling BJP
 rahul ne kaha ki agar narendra modi, shah or maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis maharashtra ke mul muddon ke bare main baat nahin kar sakate to kam se kam piemasi bank par to wo baat kare len
 He should also speak on his alleged involvement with the board of directors and BJP leaders

 Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office, Jitendra Singh said that Kinaukarshah and politicians are two important pillars of democracy
 naukarshah shashan kaa mahatvapurn aujaar hote hai or isliye kai baar sevanivrutt naukarshahon kii niyukti jaruri hoti he
 Singh said, 'we are planning to set up a committee, which will have representatives from the concerned ministries or departments and also representatives from the personnel department
 'cabinet sachiv kii adhyakshata main ek or samitisingh ne prashnkaal main bataaya ki agar niyukt do saal se adhik samay ke liye kii jaati he or vetan 50,000 rupee se adhik hoga to cabinet sachiv kii adhyakshata main ek or samiti banaai jaaegi, jo sevanivrittanaukarshahonki niyukti ke aise anya kisi prastaav par vichaar karegi

 Even if nothing has been proved right now, but if the CBI finds something wrong in the investigation, like 2G, it will not take long to create a ruckus
 is mudde par pradhanmantri ko kathghare main khadaa karne vaali team anna ab bhi khaas, khush nahin
 They do not trust the CBI investigation
 kiran bedi ne is mudde par twit kiya he ki sibiai ko siyaasi chal-kapat se mukt kiya janaa chahie taaki is sanstha par bharosa ho sake
 While out of power, all political parties have alleged that the CBI conducts a full-fledged investigation
 team anna khush ho yaa nahin, lekin ab jaanch sibiai ke hawaale hi he
 It will be clear from the investigation of CBI now that how big fraud has been done by the people of the country and who are the culprits of this deceit? While it is against the rule

 According to the CVC, 64 coal mines were awarded to about 50 private companies
 sutron ke mutabik sieji kii report main bhi in companiyon ke naam he
 The game of coal scam, in which the Prime Minister is also seen to be surrounded by allegations, started in the year 2004
 sieji kii report kii maane to 28 june 2004 tak sirf 39 koyala khadaanon kaa aavanton kiya gaya tha
 It was only in 2004 that there was a change in the coal mine allocation process
 us samay ke koyala sachiv ne pradhanmantri ko chitthee likhakar saaf kaha tha ki koyala khadaan aavanton boli lagaakar hi kiya janaa chahie
 The coal secretary also wrote that in the current process, the officials have to face many pressure
 tab koyala sachiv ke sujhaavon ko sirf isliye sire se khaarij kar diya gaya taaki aavanton jaldi ho sake
 The CAG report clearly states that there is no transparency at all in the coal mine allocation

 Two years after the Madhya Pradesh Vyapam scam has been completed, but the truth is yet to be revealed
 sach se pardaa uthanaa ek antaheen gaatha ban chalaa he
 As many as 2100 people are allegedly arrested in the case, while more than 48 people including a journalist from Aaj Tak got untimely in the cheeks of Kaal
 is maamle main supreme court dwaara sibiai jaanch ke aadesh ke baad nyaay kii kuch ummid jaagi he
 This is not only the country but the world's first such scam, which has not only become a killer, but is also becoming the biggest 'serial killer'
 isamen maut kii ginati 48 tak pahunch chuki he
 Where is it going to stop, no one is going to tell
 alam ye he ki ab to bas vyapam kaa zikr chalate hi rongte khadey ho jate hai
 Breathing becomes suffocating
 seene main jakadan sa mahasoos hone lagata he
 The sequence of deaths that began with this dreadful sequence of deaths began on 21 November 2009, when Vikas Singh Thakur, a man identified as a middleman in the PMT scam, mysteriously died in Barwani, Madhya Pradesh
 uski vajah beemaari or dawaaon kaa riection bataai gai
 But upon seeing this, a series of deaths started, which no one understood
 laavaaris haalat main milti laashenaankadon ke mutabik, vyapam ghotaale se jude 11 log alag-alag sadak haadason main, 6 log gumnaam vajahon se, 4 log khudakushi karne se, 3 jarurat se zyaada sharaab pine se, 3 beemaari kii vajah se or 2 log brain hamerej kii vajah se maare gaye hai
 The most shocking thing is that of the middlemen involved in this scam, most of them have died in road accidents
 kai mauton se pehle log achaanak gaayab ho gaye or baad main unki laash laavaaris haalat main mili
 Aajtak's journalist's death Aaj Tak's journalist Akshay Singh, who went to report on the Vyapam scam, was killed in Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh under suspicious circumstances
 haalanki, maut kii vajah ko lekar pakke taur par abhi kuch bhi kahana jaldbaaji hogi, kyonki abhi postmortem report aadhi-adhuri he or visra report kaa intjaar he
 a sample of his viscera is under investigation at AIIMS in Delhi
 unke baad hi sachai kaa khulaasa ho paaegaa
 Read further, how Vyapam became 'bermuda Triangle'
 
 
 input- agency or vaardaatvyapam banaam 'bermuda triengal'purv nirdaleey vidhayak paras sakalechaa kii kitaab 'vyaapman get' main ghotaale kaa silsilewar byoraa diya gaya he
 It has questioned the STF investigation
 kitaab main mukhyamantri, mukhya sachiv, tatkaaleen police mahanideshak se poochtacha na hone par hairaani jataai gai he
 The gang named for the scam by the STF included the then Minister of State for Higher Education Laxmikant Sharma, Private Secretary to the Chief Minister Prem Prasad, Sudhir Sharma and Dr
 ajay shankar mehta kaa naam he
 Vyapam is becoming like that mysterious 'bermuda Triangil', one who knows the secret or tries to die such a death that becomes the secret itself
 saaf he yah akele ke bas kaa khel nahin tha
 Without joining Vyapam's entire system in the mess, will any of the recruitments be fake? But the forgery would be so big, nobody thought
 isse jude logon kii mautein rahasy banati ja rahi hai
 Among the young men imprisoned in jails, Halbopal's eminent psychiatrist, Dr
 rumaa bhattacharya ne kaha ki vyapam ghotaale ke silsile main jelon main kaid noujvaan jail se baahar aane ke baad aparaadh kii duniya kii ore mud sakate hai
 Most of the students caught are teenagers or youngsters
 is umr main man par jaldi asar hota he, kyonki ve maansik taur par paripakv nahin hote
 In this case, about 900 young people are currently imprisoned in jails, who must have had dreams of a golden future

 There are no more days left for voting for the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly elections
 lekin isse pehlebijepike liye mushkilen badhati ja rahi hai
 Former MLA Vijay Aggarwal has resigned from the party
 vijay agarwal ne raigarh vidhansabha seat se maujuuda bijepi vidhayak ke khilaaf chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya he
 Explain that the BJP had recently announced 77 candidates for Chhattisgarh assembly elections
 lekin jaise hi tikat vitaran shuru hua party main baghawat ke sur tej hone lage
 In Patan Assembly in Raigad and Durg district, party candidates are openly opposing the party candidates
 vijay agarwal ne praathmik sadsyta se istipha die jane kaa patr pradesh adhyaksh dharmlaal kowshik ko bhej diya he
 On the other hand, a dozen activists have been discharged from the Saja assembly constituency, who have caused a revolt against the party's authorized candidate, Benefchand Bafna
 bilaspur vidhansabha seat main bhi aabkaari mantri amar agarwal kaa virodh shuru ho gaya he
 Hundreds of BJP workers have raised slogans against him at the party office in Bilaspur
 in kaaryakartaaon ne khuleam chetavanee di he ki yadi unhen nahin badla gaya to ve ghar baith jaaenge or agarwal kaa prachaar nahin karenge
 BJP has nominated Roshanlal Agarwal as its candidate from Raigad
 roshanalaal agarwal 2013 main vidhansabha chunaav jite the, isliye is baar bhi bijepi ne unpar bharosa jataayaa he
 Prior to this, Vijay Agarwal was an MLA from Raigad from 2003 to 2008
 nirdaleey chunaav ladenge vijay agarwaltikat naa milane se naaraaz vijay agarwal ne ab nirdaleey chunaav ladane kaa elaan kiya he
 With this move, BJP is being directly projected to lose votes
 bataaya jaataa he ki 2013 main bhi is vidhansabha seat se roshanalaal ko tikat die jane ke virodh main vijay agarwal ne bataur nirdaleey pratyaashee chunaav ladane kii taiyaari kii thi
 But the big leaders of BJP had convinced him by citing the policy of not giving tickets to the election losers by more than 10,000 votes
 lekin is baar party ne pichley vidhansabha chunaav main haare hue kai netaaon ko tikat dekar apni nai niti banaai he
 Roshanlal is also seeking a ticket for himself citing this policy
 tiemasi or congress ke bich mantri pad ke bantwaare ko lekar samjhauta ho gaya he
 The Congress agreed to give TMC two cabinet minister posts, but Mamata Banerjee asked for five cabinet ministers with one cabinet
 jaankaron ke anusaar mamata ye nahin chaahatin ki trinmul ke kisi or netaa ko unke baraabar kii haisiyat mili
 Apart from Mamta Banerjee, Sultan Ahmed, Shishir Adhikari, Saugat Rai, Dinesh Trivedi and Mukul Rai are likely to become ministers from the Trinamool quota
 aisi khabar thi ki trinmul apane cote se 3 cabinet or 4 rajya mantri chaahati he
 Apart from this, the demand of the party is that the CPM government of West Bengal should be sacked immediately as the Left has lost its grip in the Lok Sabha elections in about 200 assembly seats out of 292 seats in the state
 trinmul ke netaa kehete hai ki unki netaa cabinet ke liye koi bargening nahin kar raheen hai
 But, the news is that the party wants to occupy the ministries which are associated with Bengal somewhere
 party kii nazar koyala mantralay par he or wo apane cote se grih rajya mantri bhi bananaa chaahati he
 Apart from this, the party is also keeping an eye on the Health Ministry
 mamata banerjee agar mantri banati hai to ve rail kii maang karengi lekin, abhi ye tay nahin he ki wo mantri banengi
 Sources reveal that Mamata wants to engage in the work of the organization keeping in mind the assembly elections
 agar kuch samay pehle kii baat karen to vishesh films main ek hero hua karata tha jiceserial kisarakahate the
 It gave a lot of hit films, but now it has started paying more attention to outside banners

 randeep apane 12 saal ke kariyar main lagbhag 16 filmon main nazar aa chuke hai jinamein se aadhe se zyaada filmon main unhen darshak bina shart ke bhi dekh chuke hai
 The discussion about Randeep's sex appeal came up during the 2008 Ketan Mehta film Rang Rasiya, in which Randeep played the painter Raja Ravi Varma
 apni sexi body ke bal par na sirf unhone darshakon ke saath bollywood kaa dhyaan apni taraf aakarshith kiya tha balki 2009 main da times of india ke 50 most dizyreble main ke survey main ikkisvaan or 2010 main internet movie databes ke vishwa ke 20 sexiest main main saatvaan sthaan hasil kiya tha
 It is Randeep's goodluck that helped to further his journey from the 2011 Tigmanshu Dhulia film Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster
 tigmanshu kii yah film randeep ke kariyar main mile kaa pathar sabit hui
 After that, both his luck and image were overturned
 vishesh films kii filmein jism 2 or ab murder-3 ne randeep ko bollywood kaa sexi or demanding star bana diya he
 He also says, "my last six films have been successful, whether i am in the lead or in the small role
 or yah mere liye acha he
 "currently, Randeep's upcoming films include Vishram Sawant's 'shooter', Rensil desilva's 'ungli', 'john Day' and 'highway' and 'cabaret'"
 agar taaja khabaron par yakeen karen to ve salmaan khan kii kik main bhi kaam kar rahe hai
 He says, "I want to do a lot

 Modi wrote on Twitter, 'omar Abdullah has done a fantastic job
 svachh bharat ke prati unke is prayaas se jammu kashmir ke log prerit honge or abhiyaan ko majbootee milegi
 On this, Omar said that he would be happy with the little work done on his part in making the country clean
 dushman or vah, donon hi apni-apni jaan hatheli par liye lard rahe the, isliye hamaare 25-varshiya payalat ko 740 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se dharti se sirf 50 foot upar udana pad rahaa tha, or us vakt uske saath sirf uskaa vingamain tha
 In the battle going on in the sky of Kalaikunda airbase of West Bengal, our two jambas, who were in two planes, had to compete with the four airborne combat aircraft made in Pakistan by the US Air Force
 hamaari vayusena ke ye do jaanbaaj ginati main dekhne par dushman ke saamne nahin thahar sakate the, isliye ve ji-jaan se lard rahe the
 But in just 12 minutes of fighting with enemies, it was clear that in September 1965, our Air Force got a new hero
 do vimaanon ke formation (two aircraft formation) main ud rahe jambaazon main lead payalat the bhartiya vayusena kii 14 squadran ke anglo-indian flite leftinent alfred cook
 His wigman was Flying Officer SC Mamgai, who skipped Cook with great skill, and at the same time Cook headed straight towards the Pakistanis, and fought a battle which is considered one of the finest dogfights in the history of the Jet era
 unka pehla dushman tha flite leftinent afzal khan, or yah yuva pakistani payalat bilkul cook kii takkar kaa tha
 Now both pilots were trying to target each other, during which they started flying so low that they could stop breathing, and Cook's plane once touched the bush above which he was flying
 
 75-varshiya cook ke mutabik, "main kaaphi neeche ud rahaa tha, or jab maine use dekha, use apni gan ke nishane par liya or batan dabaa diya
 
 
 At that time i did not even know that the edge of the wing of my plane was touching the bush just four-five feet above the ground
 
 
 main uske itnaa kareeb tha ki jab maine us par waar kiya or goliyaan chalaani band kin, uske vimaan main visphot hua, or mere paas aag ke gole ke bich se guzarane ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
 
 
 " pakistani sebar vimaan ke tukade khadgpur sthit indian institute of technology (iaiti) ke baahar mili, or bahut-se vidhyaarthiyon ne is ladaai ko aakhir tak dekha
 But where did the fight just end
 
 
 cook iske turant baad ke vaakyaat yaad karte hai, "khushi mahasoos karne kaa to vakt hi nahin tha, kyonki main jaanata tha, koi or bhi meri jaan ke peeche he
 
 
 So, immediately went up, took a sharp right turn, stopped and got into another plane
 
 
 " a dogfight from another plane is described by Cook as 'intense'
 darasal, is vimaan se jo yuddh hua, uske dauraan cook pakistani vimaan ke itnaa kareeb ja rahe the ki hawa main donon vimaanon kii takkar hone kaa khatra baar-baar sane aa rahaa tha
 Cook, who settled in Australia four years after the 1965 war, recalled during his recent visit to Delhi, "we were so close to each other that we could see each other's face
" 
 
 " "I could see his face, and that mine
 
 
 mujhe uskaa helmet dikh rahaa tha, safed helmet, jis par uskaa naam likhaa tha
 
 
 i also had a white helmet on my head with my name written on it
 
 
 main achaanak bahut neeche gaya, or acchhee posishan main pahunch jane kaa phayda uthaate hue uske nishane par aate hi goliyaan chalaani shuru kar deen
 
 
 i knew, he was fired, and i expected his plane to explode now
 
 
 " but that did not happen
 cook kaa sara hai-explosive aslaa khatm ho gaya, or ab unke paas sirf ball-amunishan bachaa tha, jo aamtaur par training ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 So, despite Cook's blows and Pakistani jet losses from the attack, he was still flying
 ab cook ne tay kiya ki is duusare sebar vimaan kaa peechha karnaa bekaar he, jo aakhirkaar aisi haalat main apane base kii taraf bhaag gaya, jiske baad vah dobaaraa shaayad kabhi nahin ud paaya hoga
 "he was constantly trying to run away from me, and suddenly i saw, he started diving down more than before, so first thing came to my mind that maybe someone has warned him, and someone else behind me is
 
 
 " Significantly, air battles have been quite rare since the Second World War, and very few pilots have a chance to join one dogfight in their careers, while our Alfred Cook was going to join his third dogfight in a single day , And the interesting fact is that this Tusri dogfight was also not the last
 pashchim bengal ke akaash main ab teesraa sebar vimaan cook ke peeche tha, so, unhone sahi posishan main aane ke liye ghota lagaaya
 He had to make sharp turns for him, and use the power of his Hawker Hunter aircraft engine to follow the enemy
 cook ke anusaar, "main us par goliyaan barsaata hua upar se neeche kii ore aa rahaa tha, or soch rahaa tha, nishaanaa lag kyon nahin rahaa he, uske vimaan main visphot kyon nahin ho rahaa he
 
 
 The His plane went away, and i worried about why he didn't fire
 
 
 tabhi mujhe ehsaas hua ki zamin kaaphi nazadik aa chuki he
 
 
 My fingers were still on the trigger, so i immediately pulled the joystick back, but unfortunately by then all the slug i had was gone, because our firing time on Hunter planes is only about five seconds
 
 
 aap chunki 100 goliyaan prati second kii raftaar se firing kar rahe hote hai, so, us gote se baahar aate-aate hi meraa aslaa khatm ho gaya, or main zamin se takaraate-takaraate bachaa
 
 
 " teesraa pakistani sebar vimaan bhaagane main kaamyaab ho gaya, or cook ko bhi is baat se puri tasalli thi, kyonki unke paas aslaa khatm ho chukaa tha, lekin hawaii ladaai main apane vingamain kaa dhyaan rakhana hi khaas gur he
 Flying Officer SC Mamgai's life was in complete danger, as a Saber aircraft had reached right behind him, but Cook was fully alert to the situation
 unhone bataaya, "maine mamgai ko chetavanee di
 
 
 i said 'mam break port'
 
 
 or phir maine use (dushman ko) ulajhaa liya or ham yah sab airfield par bane flying control ke thik upar kar rahe the
 
 
 He started doing loops and acrobats to get rid of me, but my plane was light at the time, and since we used to do such acrobats for fun, i had no problem following him
 
 
 "tippaniyan But Cook could not attack the Pakistani aircraft, because there was not a single bullet left
 iske bajaae vah uske thik peeche lage rahe, or lagaataar nishane par rakhkar use bhartiya seemaa ke baahar khaded diya
 Cook, who came to Hindustan to attend the event that marked the completion of 50 years of the 1965 war, looked smiling lost in the memories of his last battle, and said of the Pakistani pilot, "he must have known that his fate that day was very good Was
 
 
 " Both Cook and Mamgai were awarded the Vir Chakra
 cook ne iske baad kuch hi saal ladaaku vimaan udaae, or phir australia chale gaye
 Although he later flew small civilian aircraft, the experience of flying Hawker Hunter aircraft just 10 feet above the ground at a speed of 740 kmph could not be found again
 
 
 pashchim bengal ke kalaikunda airbase ke akaash main chal rahi is ladaai main do vimaanon main savaar hamaare donon jambaazon kaa muqabla pakistani vayusena ke america main bane chaar sebar ladaaku vimaanon se tha
 These two brave men of our Air Force could not stand in front of the enemy on seeing them in the count, so they were fighting wholeheartedly
 lekin dushmano ke saath sirf 12 hi minute kii ladaai main yah saaf ho gaya tha ki sitambar, 1965 main hamaari vayusena ko ek nayaa hero mil gaya
 The lead pilots in the two aircraft flying two aircraft formation were anglo-indian Flight Lieutenant Alfred Cook of 14 Squadron of the Indian Air Force
 unke vingamain the flying officer essi mamgai, jinhone behad kushalta se cook kaa saath diya, or isi dam par cook sidhe pakistaniyon kii taraf bad gaye, or aisi ladaai lade, jise jet yug ke itihaas kii behtareen dogphiton main shumaar kiya jaataa he
 His first enemy was Flight Lieutenant Afzal Khan, and this young Pakistani pilot was absolutely a collision with Cook
 ab donon hi payalat ek-duusare ko nishane par lene kii koshish kar rahe the, jiske dauraan ve itnaa neeche udne lage ki dekhakar saansen ruk jaaen, or cook kaa vimaan to ek baar us jhaadi se chhu bhi gaya, jiske upar vah ud rahe the
 According to the 75-year-old cook, "I was flying down a lot, and when i saw him, he hit his gun and hit the button
" 
 
 us vakt mujhe yah bhi pataa nahin chalaa ki mere vimaan ke pankh kaa kinaaraa zamin se sirf chaar-paanch foot upar jhaadi se chhu rahaa he
 
 
 i was so close to him that when i attacked him and stopped firing, his plane exploded, and i had no choice but to pass through the circle of fire
 
 
 " Pieces of the Pakistani Saber aircraft were found outside the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Kharagpur, and many students watched the fight to the end
 lekin ladaai abhi khatm kahaan hui thi
 
 
 Cook recounts the incident shortly thereafter, "there was no time to feel happy, because i knew someone else was behind my life
" 
 
 so, turant upar gaya, tikhaa daayan mode liya, rukaa or duusare vimaan se bhid gaya
 
 
 " duusare vimaan se hui dogphite ko cook 'intence' (joardaar) bataate hai
 In fact, during the war that took place with this aircraft, Cook was getting so close to the Pakistani aircraft that the danger of collision of both planes in the air was coming again and again
 1965 kii ladaai ke chaar saal baad australia jaakar bas chuke cook ne apni haal hi kii dilli yatra ke dauraan yaad kiya, "ham donon ek-duusare ke itnaa kareeb se guzar rahe the ki ham ek-duusare kaa cheharaa dekh sakate the

 Cook's entire high-exploratory asylum was over, and now he had only ball-ammunition left, which is commonly used for training
 so, cook ke waar karne or pakistani jet ko hamale se nuksaan hone ke baavjood vah abhi tak ud rahaa tha
 Now Cook decided that it was useless to chase down this second Saber aircraft, which eventually ran towards his base in such a condition, after which he might have never flown again
 "vah lagaataar mujhase dur bhaagane kii koshish kar rahaa tha, or achaanak maine dekha, vah pehle kii tulana main zyaada neeche dive karne laga he, so, sabase pehle mere dimag main aayaa ki shaayad kisi ne use chetaya he, or mere peeche koi or he

 Since you are firing at 100 bullets per second, my slack came to an end when i came out of that ditch, and i survived hitting the ground
 
 
 " The third Pakistani Saber plane managed to escape, and Cook was also comforted by this, because he had finished the asylum, but in air combat, it is a special skill to take care of his wigman
 flying officer essi mamgai kii jaan puri tarah khatre main thi, kyonki ek sebar vimaan thik unke peeche pahunch chukaa tha, lekin cook halaat kii taraf puri tarah chaukanne the
 He told, "I warned Mamgai

 And then i entangled him (the enemy) and we were doing it right above the flying control on the airfield
 
 
 usne mujhase peechha chhudaane ke liye loop or kalabaziyaan shuru kar deen, lekin us vakt meraa vimaan halkaa tha, or chunki aisi kalabaziyaan ham masti ke liye karte hi rahete the, so, mujhe uske peeche lage rahane main koi dikkat nahin hui
 
 
 "comments lekin cook us pakistani vimaan par waar nahin kar paae, kyonki ek bhi goli bachi hi nahin thi
 Instead, he followed her right away, and kept her out of the Indian border, constantly on target

 " cook or mamgai, donon ko vir chakra pradaan kiya gaya
 Cook flew fighter jets a few years after that, and then moved to Australia
 haalanki unhone baad main chote naagarik vimaan udaae, lekin 740 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se zamin se sirf 10 foot upar hoker hunter vimaan udaane jaisaa tajurba phir nahin mil saktaa
 
 
 But in just 12 minutes of fighting with enemies, it was clear that in September 1965, our Air Force got a new hero
 do vimaanon ke formation (two aircraft formation) main ud rahe jambaazon main lead payalat the bhartiya vayusena kii 14 squadran ke anglo-indian flite leftinent alfred cook
 His wigman was Flying Officer SC Mamgai, who skipped Cook with great skill, and at the same time Cook headed straight towards the Pakistanis, and fought a battle which is considered one of the finest dogfights in the history of the Jet era
 unka pehla dushman tha flite leftinent afzal khan, or yah yuva pakistani payalat bilkul cook kii takkar kaa tha
 Now both pilots were trying to target each other, during which they started flying so low that they could stop breathing, and Cook's plane once touched the bush above which he was flying
 
 75-varshiya cook ke mutabik, "main kaaphi neeche ud rahaa tha, or jab maine use dekha, use apni gan ke nishane par liya or batan dabaa diya
 
 
 At that time i did not even know that the edge of the wing of my plane was touching the bush just four-five feet above the ground
 
 
 main uske itnaa kareeb tha ki jab maine us par waar kiya or goliyaan chalaani band kin, uske vimaan main visphot hua, or mere paas aag ke gole ke bich se guzarane ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
 
 
 " pakistani sebar vimaan ke tukade khadgpur sthit indian institute of technology (iaiti) ke baahar mili, or bahut-se vidhyaarthiyon ne is ladaai ko aakhir tak dekha
 But where did the fight just end
 
 
 cook iske turant baad ke vaakyaat yaad karte hai, "khushi mahasoos karne kaa to vakt hi nahin tha, kyonki main jaanata tha, koi or bhi meri jaan ke peeche he
 
 
 So, immediately went up, took a sharp right turn, stopped and got into another plane
 
 
 " a dogfight from another plane is described by Cook as 'intense'
 darasal, is vimaan se jo yuddh hua, uske dauraan cook pakistani vimaan ke itnaa kareeb ja rahe the ki hawa main donon vimaanon kii takkar hone kaa khatra baar-baar sane aa rahaa tha
 Cook, who settled in Australia four years after the 1965 war, recalled during his recent visit to Delhi, "we were so close to each other that we could see each other's face
" 
 
 " "I could see his face, and that mine
 
 
 mujhe uskaa helmet dikh rahaa tha, safed helmet, jis par uskaa naam likhaa tha
 
 
 i also had a white helmet on my head with my name written on it
 
 
 main achaanak bahut neeche gaya, or acchhee posishan main pahunch jane kaa phayda uthaate hue uske nishane par aate hi goliyaan chalaani shuru kar deen
 
 
 i knew, he was fired, and i expected his plane to explode now
 
 
 " but that did not happen
 cook kaa sara hai-explosive aslaa khatm ho gaya, or ab unke paas sirf ball-amunishan bachaa tha, jo aamtaur par training ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 So, despite Cook's blows and Pakistani jet losses from the attack, he was still flying
 ab cook ne tay kiya ki is duusare sebar vimaan kaa peechha karnaa bekaar he, jo aakhirkaar aisi haalat main apane base kii taraf bhaag gaya, jiske baad vah dobaaraa shaayad kabhi nahin ud paaya hoga
 "he was constantly trying to run away from me, and suddenly i saw, he started diving down more than before, so first thing came to my mind that maybe someone has warned him, and someone else behind me is
 
 
 " Significantly, air battles have been quite rare since the Second World War, and very few pilots have a chance to join one dogfight in their careers, while our Alfred Cook was going to join his third dogfight in a single day , And the interesting fact is that this Tusri dogfight was also not the last
 pashchim bengal ke akaash main ab teesraa sebar vimaan cook ke peeche tha, so, unhone sahi posishan main aane ke liye ghota lagaaya
 He had to make sharp turns for him, and use the power of his Hawker Hunter aircraft engine to follow the enemy
 cook ke anusaar, "main us par goliyaan barsaata hua upar se neeche kii ore aa rahaa tha, or soch rahaa tha, nishaanaa lag kyon nahin rahaa he, uske vimaan main visphot kyon nahin ho rahaa he
 
 
 The His plane went away, and i worried about why he didn't fire
 
 
 tabhi mujhe ehsaas hua ki zamin kaaphi nazadik aa chuki he
 
 
 My fingers were still on the trigger, so i immediately pulled the joystick back, but unfortunately by then all the slug i had was gone, because our firing time on Hunter planes is only about five seconds
 
 
 aap chunki 100 goliyaan prati second kii raftaar se firing kar rahe hote hai, so, us gote se baahar aate-aate hi meraa aslaa khatm ho gaya, or main zamin se takaraate-takaraate bachaa
 
 
 " teesraa pakistani sebar vimaan bhaagane main kaamyaab ho gaya, or cook ko bhi is baat se puri tasalli thi, kyonki unke paas aslaa khatm ho chukaa tha, lekin hawaii ladaai main apane vingamain kaa dhyaan rakhana hi khaas gur he
 Flying Officer SC Mamgai's life was in complete danger, as a Saber aircraft had reached right behind him, but Cook was fully alert to the situation
 unhone bataaya, "maine mamgai ko chetavanee di
 
 
 i said 'mam break port'
 
 
 or phir maine use (dushman ko) ulajhaa liya or ham yah sab airfield par bane flying control ke thik upar kar rahe the
 
 
 He started doing loops and acrobats to get rid of me, but my plane was light at the time, and since we used to do such acrobats for fun, i had no problem following him
 
 
 "tippaniyan But Cook could not attack the Pakistani aircraft, because there was not a single bullet left
 iske bajaae vah uske thik peeche lage rahe, or lagaataar nishane par rakhkar use bhartiya seemaa ke baahar khaded diya
 Cook, who came to Hindustan to attend the event that marked the completion of 50 years of the 1965 war, looked smiling lost in the memories of his last battle, and said of the Pakistani pilot, "he must have known that his fate that day was very good Was
 
 
 " Both Cook and Mamgai were awarded the Vir Chakra
 cook ne iske baad kuch hi saal ladaaku vimaan udaae, or phir australia chale gaye
 Although he later flew small civilian aircraft, the experience of flying Hawker Hunter aircraft just 10 feet above the ground at a speed of 740 kmph could not be found again
 
 
 unke vingamain the flying officer essi mamgai, jinhone behad kushalta se cook kaa saath diya, or isi dam par cook sidhe pakistaniyon kii taraf bad gaye, or aisi ladaai lade, jise jet yug ke itihaas kii behtareen dogphiton main shumaar kiya jaataa he
 His first enemy was Flight Lieutenant Afzal Khan, and this young Pakistani pilot was absolutely a collision with Cook
 ab donon hi payalat ek-duusare ko nishane par lene kii koshish kar rahe the, jiske dauraan ve itnaa neeche udne lage ki dekhakar saansen ruk jaaen, or cook kaa vimaan to ek baar us jhaadi se chhu bhi gaya, jiske upar vah ud rahe the
 According to the 75-year-old cook, "I was flying down a lot, and when i saw him, he hit his gun and hit the button
" 
 
 us vakt mujhe yah bhi pataa nahin chalaa ki mere vimaan ke pankh kaa kinaaraa zamin se sirf chaar-paanch foot upar jhaadi se chhu rahaa he
 
 
 i was so close to him that when i attacked him and stopped firing, his plane exploded, and i had no choice but to pass through the circle of fire
 
 
 " Pieces of the Pakistani Saber aircraft were found outside the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Kharagpur, and many students watched the fight to the end
 lekin ladaai abhi khatm kahaan hui thi
 
 
 Cook recounts the incident shortly thereafter, "there was no time to feel happy, because i knew someone else was behind my life

 1965 kii ladaai ke chaar saal baad australia jaakar bas chuke cook ne apni haal hi kii dilli yatra ke dauraan yaad kiya, "ham donon ek-duusare ke itnaa kareeb se guzar rahe the ki ham ek-duusare kaa cheharaa dekh sakate the

 Cook's entire high-exploratory asylum was over, and now he had only ball-ammunition left, which is commonly used for training
 so, cook ke waar karne or pakistani jet ko hamale se nuksaan hone ke baavjood vah abhi tak ud rahaa tha
 Now Cook decided that it was useless to chase down this second Saber aircraft, which eventually ran towards his base in such a condition, after which he might have never flown again
 "vah lagaataar mujhase dur bhaagane kii koshish kar rahaa tha, or achaanak maine dekha, vah pehle kii tulana main zyaada neeche dive karne laga he, so, sabase pehle mere dimag main aayaa ki shaayad kisi ne use chetaya he, or mere peeche koi or he

 The third Saber plane was now behind Cook in the West Bengal sky, so he dived to get in the right position
 unhen uske liye tikhaa mode lene the, or apane hoker hunter vimaan ke ingine kii takat kaa istemaal karnaa tha, taaki dushman ke peeche aa saken
 According to Cook, "I was coming from top to bottom with the bullets on him, and was wondering, why the target is not targeted, why his plane is not exploding

 com / dolzac0tbj— Kiren Rijiju (@kirenrijiju)august 10, 2019 a day after the Devendra Fadnavis government won the trust vote in the Assembly, the Shiv Sena, a former ally of the BJP, today accused the Maharashtra government of violating constitutional provisions by proving a majority amidst the noise and strangling the state's age-old traditions
 
 shivasena ne svachh sarkaar chalaane ke bhaajapa ke daawey ko bhi ‘jhooth’ qaraar diya
 The party's mouthpiece 'saamana' has written in an editorial, that the BJP promised a clean government when it came to power
 janata se kiye gaye saare vaayade bhuulakar unhone vishwaas mat ke dauraan sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan kiya
 This proves that all the claims of running a clean government were false
 shivasena ne likhaa he ki vidhansabha ke niyamon ko todakar or paramparaon kii andekhi karke unhone rajya kii janata ke saath ‘dhokhadhadi’ kii he, jiske liye unhen maaf nahin kiya jayega
 The party said, now will people trust the party, which only violated all rules to win the trust vote and strangled years-old traditions? You have broken the trust of the people who gave you the biggest mandate
 iske liye aapako kabhi maaf nahin kiya jayega
 According to the editorial, if you were so confident of getting a majority, then you could accept the opposition parties' demand for division of votes
 aapako bina vishwaas mat ke sarkaar chalaane ke liye janata ko jawaab dena hoga
 The Shiv Sena said that the BJP has managed to win the confidence vote amidst the noise in the House, but the opposition parties will not accept this majority until it is constitutionally proved in the House
 kal jaise hi vidhansabha adhyaksh haribhau bagade ne sadan main vishwaas mat ke bhaajapa netaa ashish shellar ke ek pankti ke prastaav ke paarit hone kii ghoshnaa kii, sadan ke andar or baahar hangaamaa shuru ho gaya
 The speaker suspended five Congress mlas from the House for two years on charges of pushing and hurting Governor Vidyasagar Rao
 congress ne vidhansabha adhyaksh kii vyavastha ko ‘loktantr kii hatya’ qaraar diya vahiin shivasena ne ise maharashtra ke liye ‘kaala din’ kaha

 People find proximity to connect with themselves - and argue for disconnection from opponents

 kya he kismat conection?logon se judane kaa modi kaa ye taaja nuskhaa he
 Probably more than those who believe in luck
 naseeb ko hi sab kuch maanate hai
 Let's go to a meeting of Modi in Delhi
 modi logon se poochhate hai, 'aapako naseeb vaala chahie yaa kam naseeb vaala?' phir vistaar se samajhaate hai, “petrol-dijal ke daam kam hue hai or janata kii jeb main kuch paise bachane lage hai
 Our opponents say that this is Modi's luck, that's why
 ab mujhe bataaie ki aapako naseeb vaala chahie yaa kam naseeb vaala chahie
 Let us assume that Modi is lucky, but the money is left
 agar modi kaa naseeb desh ke kaam aata he to isse badhiya naseeb kii baat kya ho sakati he
 "but, if the stakes are turned upside down, so are we alert
" tasviir kaa doosraa pahalu dekhie

 Modi says, "I come from the real Dwarka

 He further says, "the problem of water in Dwarka was over with the formation of BJP government in Haryana
 ”“main bhi purvaanchali hum”uttar pradesh or bihar se dilli aae matadaataaon ke liye modi ke paas ek smart card or he, jo haal hi main ishyu hua he – purvanchal card
 Modi says that he is an MP from Varanasi, so he has become Purvanchali
 modi kehete hai ki vah dilli ke logon kii seva kar loksabhaa kii jeet ke karj kaa byaaj chukaana chaahate hai
 "I have been called by Delhiites" while going to the Lok Sabha elections in Varanasi, Modi said, "neither i have come nor i have been sent
 darasal, mujhe to maa ganga ne yahaan bulaayaa he
 "now Modi is saying to the voters of Delhi," i have come to Delhi at the invitation of your people
 main aapaki seva ke liye aayaa hum
 i have come to work with you shoulder to shoulder
 ”or vikasawaalon, ‘main hum vikaas
 
 
 'among other things, Modi tells the people in his election meetings that he has won the election on the issue of development - and is running the government on the same line
 shuukravaar ko rajyasabha main kendriya shahari vikaas mantri venkaiya naidu ne kaha tha, “dilli kii jeet desh ke liye bhi jaruri he
 Three Rajya Sabha seats come from Delhi which will help the government's development agenda
 ”jinhen vikaas kii bhashaa samaj main aati he, modi unhen yahi samajhane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki dilli kaa vikaas tabhi sambhav he jab centre kii tarj par yahaan bhi bijepi kii sarkaar bane
 Naidu's statement becomes important in this reference
 isamen kiran bedi ko bhi feet karne kii koshish he
 Kiran Bedi was known as 'crane Bedi' during her police service
 ab bijepi unhen ‘vikaas bedi’ ke taur par pahchaan dilaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Yes, there will be an attempt to create a Modi wave through the path - now it is completely clear

 I'm not you main to main hum hi, tum bhi main hi hum
 "just as some Baba explains to his devotee, some people also treat their 'friends-friends' on the same line," Janu, i am just yours
 ”ab tak aapane aise general flert or spiritual flert dekhe honge

 somvaar ko hi kejariwal ne elaan kiya tha ki log siver conection muft main le sakate hai
 After this, now the sewer water connection has been made for only Rs 2310

 lagaataar bharat kii ore aakraamak rukh apana rahaa chini sarkari akhbaar global times ne ab sidhe taur par enese ajit dobhaal ko nishane par liya he
 The newspaper has written that he is the main actor behind the ongoing Doklam dispute between China and India
 akhbaar ne likhaa he ki chini sena or bhartiya sena main jo vivaad chal rahaa he iske peeche dobhaal hi hai, vahiin bhartiya media is tarah kaa maahaul bana rahaa he ki jaise unki yatra se sab thik ho jayega
 Significantly, Ajit Doval will travel to Beijing on 27 July to attend the BRICS meeting
 global times main likhaa he ki agar bharat aisa sochataa he ki dobhaal kii yatra se beijing maan jayega, to ye bilkul galat he
 The time of Doval's visit to resolve the border issue is not right, there will be nothing according to the wishes of India
 akhbaar ke ye lekh aise samay main aayaa he, jis samay china kii ore se is mudde par kadaa rukh apanaaya gaya he
 On Monday, a strong statement came from the PLA on this issue
 jisamen kaha gaya tha ki pahaad ko hataanaa mushkil he, par chini sena ko hataanaa naammumkin he
 On Monday, it was said on behalf of the Chinese Foreign Ministry that talks could be held between the Chinese NSA and Ajit Doval, but at the same time they had expressed any apprehension of anything positive on the Doklam issue
 isamen kaha gaya he ki bharat kaa border se apni sena ko hataanaa hi donon deshon main acchhee baatcheet kaa ek maatr kaaran he
 He has said that Beijing does not have an obligation to speak with Delhi and appeal to withdraw the army or stop road construction
 china kii ore se bharat ke saath is mudde par tab tak koi baat nahin kii jaaegi, jab tak bharat apni sena nahin hataa letaa he
 The newspaper wrote that the meeting in BRICS is a routine meeting, it is not the right place to resolve the border issue of china-india
 1962 kii jang kaa udhaaharan dete hue akhbaar ne likhaa ki agar bharat ne apni sena nahin hataai to china is par kadaa ection legaa
 The article says that the Chinese Army can take so many actions that the Indian government and the army cannot even imagine
 hamen nahin lagata ki bharat china ke saath sainya sangharsh ke liye taiyaar he
 If he chooses this path then China is fully capable of protecting itself, Delhi will have to pay a huge price for it

 Rajendra Singh said that the work of DPR for 10 big barrages from Haldia to Allahabad has started, which will eliminate the avidity of the Ganges and convert it into a lake and a pond
 aise main unka andolan bihar se shuru hoga
 Rajendra Singh said that a big movement has started against it in the areas situated along the Ganges in Bihar and it will not be allowed to be built during his life
 rajendra singh modi ke khilaaf itane gusse main hai ki wo pradhanmantri ke khilaaf bolte-bolte bhashaa kii maryaada tak bhula baithe
 Socialist leaders Ramvihari Singh and Kedarnath Pandey have also joined them in this campaign

 If they do not respect, then we will force their honor
 jab tak ham jinda he ham koi bairaj nahin banane denge
 People on both sides of the Ganga made up their mind to oppose it
 'gusse main rajendra singh bole, 'ham daawey ke saath kehete hai modi ji hamaare jite ji koi bairaj nahin banegaa
 Because the Ganges is our mother, we cannot see the mother as pieces
 maa maa kii tarah bahani chahie
 This barrage is a conspiracy to cut the mother's body into a lake, into lakes
 are wo modi sirf bolta he ki main ganga kaa betaa hum usne ajtak kisi ko nahin poocha
 We have been working on the Ganges for the last 20 years, he has no sense that the person working on the Ganga should be called
 wo pradhanmantri ban gaya par wo keval ganga ke kaaran chunaav jitkar aayaa he, wo ganga kii hatya karavaayega chunaav jitkar
 'rajendra Singh did not stop here, he said,' i will not go to any court and tell the people how the Modi whom you have won with so many votes is cheating the country

 The decision on the Scheduled castes-scheduled Tribes (SC / ST) Amendment Act by the Modi government is now becoming a sore throat of the BJP
 savarnon kii party kaa tamgaa rakhane vaali bijepi ko usee kaa mul votbank ankhen dikhaa rahaa he
 The BJP is upset with the upper castes' displeasure ahead of the assembly elections in three states
 yahi vajah he kimadhya pradeshmukhyamantrishivarajane savarnon ko pataane kii pahal shuru kar di he
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that SC / ST will not be arrested in the Prevention of Harassment Act until the police investigate the matter
 chouhan se jab sawaal kiya gaya ki kya rajya sarkaar centre sarkaar ke adhyadesh ke evaj main koi adhyadesh laaegi, to unhone kaha, 'mujhe jo kahana tha wo maine kah diya
 Furthering his point, the Chief Minister said that the interests of all the upper castes, backward classes, scheduled castes, tribes will be protected in the state, whoever will be arrested only after investigation of whatever complaint comes
 darasal SC / ST act kii isi prakriya ko lekar madhya pradesh main pichley dinonsvarnasamudaay ke logon ne sadak par utar pradarshan kiya tha
 35 organizations of the Savarna community, including the Savarna Samaj, the Karni Sena, and the General, Backward and Minority Officers Employees Association (SPX), took to the streets by announcing 'bharat Bandh' against the SC / ST Act
 is dauraan kai jagah aagjanee or todphod ke maamle bhi saamne aae the
 Shivraj himself has to bear the displeasure of the upper castes
 pichley dinon shivaraj kii janashirwad yatra churhat vidhansabha kshetra main pahunchi to kuch savarna samudaay ke logon ne unke rath par patharbaji kar di thi
 Not only this, while addressing a public meeting, the incident of throwing slippers on them was also revealed
 savarnon ke lagaataar virodh se shivaraj ko apni satta jaati dikhne lagi
 As a result, he had to give a statement about the SC / ST Act that he would not allow anyone to be arrested without police investigation
 jabaki SC / ST act main shikaayat ke baad aaropee kii turant giraftaar karnaa padataa he
 However, Shivraj has not issued any mandate for this
 yahi vajah he ki ise vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar savarnon kii naaraazgi ko dur kar unhen pataane ke makasad se dekha ja rahaa he
 However, Shivraj Singh's statement is being opposed in the BJP itself
 party ke dalit saansad udit raaj ne kaha ki is maamle main main takalif mahasoos kar rahaa hum ki aisa bayaan kyon diya he
 Our government strengthens the law and our Chief Minister dilutes
 isse badi bechaini mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 Phones are also coming
 samaaj ke andar phir se niraashaa he
 Outrage has arisen, so it should be reconsidered
 udit raaj ne kaha, yah jo hamaara samaaj he, isamen ekta honi chahie
 Which is contradiction must end
 faasla khatm hona chahie
 This will increase casteism
 main baat party main bhi rakhuunga
 i will talk to Mr
 Chauhan
 main rashtriya adhyaksh se bhi baat karuunga
 In the case of SC-ST itself, why such a double character, double standard is being adopted
 shivaraj singh chouhan ko kahuunga ki vah is maamle ko waapas len, is bayaan ko waapas len
 The upper caste population in the country is about 15 percent
 ye bijepi kaa mul votbank mana jaataa he
 That is why BJP is called the party of upper castes
 brahman-rajput-kysth, bhoomihaar or vaisya kii party kahi jane vaali bijepi dhire-dhire samaaj ke har tabake kii bich apana dayera badhanaa chaahati he
 Accordingly, the Modi government overturned the decision given by the Supreme Court on the SC / ST Act
 lekin sarkaar ke faisle uske saamne nai musiibat khadi kar di he
 As a result of this, BJP President Amit Shah, in the National Executive meeting held in Delhi recently, entrusted the responsibility of party leaders and Chief Ministers to overcome the anger of the upper caste community and convince them
 ek taraf puure desh main cashles kii charchaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley ask people to become cashless at every opportunity
 vahiin duusari taraf cricket ke fatafat formet ipel kii dhooma he
 Between the discussion of cashless and IPL, we are telling you about the 'runless' (affordable bowling) bowler
 westeindies ke spinner samual badri ne ipel 10 kii pehali hetric lene kaa karishma kiya he
 Badri completed the hat-trick by dismissing Parthiv Patel, Mitchell mcclenaghan and Rohit Sharma for three consecutive balls in the match against Mumbai Indians
 badri ne jis over main hetric lee
 He was maiden over
 yah tii-20 maichon main westeindies ke is phiraki gendbaaj kaa 20waan madan over tha
 He became the first bowler in cricket history to do so
 samual badri ne match main 9 ran dekar chaar wicket liye
 This is the best performance by any bowler from Royal Challengers Bangalore
 trinidad ke lambey kad ke is khilaadi ne international tii20 maichon kaa record hi khaasaa prabhaavshaalee he
 This leg break bowler has scored 16 in 36 International T20 matches so far
 36 ke prabhaavshaalee ausat se 47 wicket liye hai
 During this period, four wickets for 15 runs has been his best performance and his economy rate of 5
 65 kaa rahaa he
 Significantly, in T20 cricket, an economy rate of less than six is the hallmark of any bowler being 'stingy'
 tii20 worldcup main bhi badri westeindies team ke 'pramukh hathiyaar' rahe hai
 The comments overal tii20 ke hisaab se dekhen to badri ne 158 maichon main 20
 Has taken 156 wickets at an average of 47
 is dauraan unka iconomi rate 5
 68 and his best performance was five wickets for 22 runs
 khaas baat yah he ki badri tii20 cricket formet ke kanjus gendbaaj hi nahin he
 On important occasions, they achieve successes for the team
 badri kii gendbaaji style khalis leg brake bolers se kuch alag he
 They do not turn the ball too much but are successful in giving a lot of bounce due to their stature
 sateekta ke maamle main unki tulana team india ke purv cricketer anil kumble se kii ja sakati he
 The tall Trinidad player has a very impressive international T20 record
 ab tak 36 international tii20 maichon main is leg brake bowler ne 16
 Has taken 47 wickets at an impressive average of 36
 is dauraan 15 ran dekar chaar wicket unka sarvshereshth pradarshan rahaa he or unka iconomi rate 5
 Has been 65
 gauratlab he ki tii20 cricket main chah se kam kaa iconomi rate kisi bhi gendbaaj ke 'kanjus' hone kii pahchaan hota he
 Badri has also been the 'main weapon' of the West Indies team in the T20 World Cup
 tippaniyan In terms of overall T20, Badri has 20 in 158 matches
 47 ke ausat se 156 wicket liye hai
 During this, his economy rate of 5
 68 kaa he or sarvshereshth pradarshan 22 ran dekar paanch wicket rahaa he
 The special thing is that Badri is not just a stingy bowler of T20 cricket format
 ahm maukon par ye team ke liye safaltaaen hasil karte hai
 Badri's bowling style is somewhat different from Khalis leg break bowlers
 ve gendko bahut zyada turn nahin karaate lekin apane kad ke kaaran kaaphi oochaal dene main safal hote hai
 In terms of accuracy, he can be compared to former India cricketer Anil Kumble
 is dauraan 15 ran dekar chaar wicket unka sarvshereshth pradarshan rahaa he or unka iconomi rate 5
 Has been 65

 kya hai team india kii mushkilenlagataar haar rahi bhartiya team ko tii twanti world cap se pehle apana khoyaa hua manobal hasil karnaa hoga
 The team's problem is batting, which has been completely revolving around the current Indian captain Virat Kohli's Eid
 koi bhi anya ballebaaj lambey samay tak krij par tike rahane kaa jajba nahin dikhaa paaya he
 Again there will be an Indian batting test against Afghanistan
 koun hai afghanistan ke mukhya hathiyaatfghanistan ke tej gendbaajon ne prabhaavshaalee pradarshan karke sabhi kaa dhyaan apni taraf khinchaa he
 He has very good fast bowlers in the form of Shapoor and Daulat Jadaran
 baayen or daayen haath kaa gendbaaj hone se tej gendbaaji main vividhta bhi aati he
 It has spinners like captain Mohammad Nabi, Samiullah Shenwari and Hamza Hotak in its spin department
 nabi ko apni of spin se acha turn mil rahaa he jabaki shenavari kii leg brake kaaphi sateek he jisase ve team kii taraf se wicket lene vaale spinner ban gaye hai
 Left-arm spinner Hotak has played his part in stopping the run pace

 Have lost runs at the rate of 04
 afghanistan kii team utsaah se labarej he
 He defeated Bangladesh by 32 runs, his first win against Test playing nations

 Kohli has played the role of captain well
 unhone bangladesh ke khilaaf chah wicket kii jeet main bharat ko shuruuaati jhatkon se ubaara or 136 ran kii pari kheli
 After this, Kohli could not play a big innings and India had to face defeat in both the matches
 bharat ke visheshgy ballebaajon rohit sharma, shikhar dhawan, ajinkya rahane or ambati rayudu ne in maichon main ardhashatak jamaaye, lekin ve ise badi pari main nahin badal paae, jisase mukhya antar paidaa hua
 Rohit gave the team a good start against Pakistan but after completing his half-century, he gave his wicket in the prize
india were able to reach a respectable score thanks to ambati rayudu ke 58 or ravindra jadeja ke naabad 52 ran kii badaulat bharat sammanjanak score tak pahunch paaya tha
 Afghanistan will be ahead of Ireland, Afghanistan's batting is inexperienced, the proof of this was found against Sri Lanka last night when its entire team collapsed for 124 runs
 lekin bangladesh par jeet se pehali isisi ranking talika main jagah banane vaali yah team tab bhi utsaah se bhari he

" ' raut ne post main apane falores kaa abhivadan 'jai hind' ke naare ke saath kiya he, vah bhi tab jab party lambey samay se abhivadan ke liye 'jai maharashtra' ke istemaal par jor detii rahi he
 Raut is scheduled to meet Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari this evening amidst the ongoing deadlock over the formation of the next government in Maharashtra with coalition partner BJP
 yah baithak aise samay ho rahi he jab ek din pehle hi rajyasabha sadsy raut ne daawa kiya tha ki jald hi '170 vidhayakon' ke samarthan se unki party kaa mukhyamantri hoga
 There is still a deadlock over the formation of government in the state

 The message read: 'hello, i am Sanjay Raut

 Pawar said, 'that means i should call them
 main phone kar, jaanch karuunga
 In the recent elections for the 288-member assembly in Maharashtra, BJP won 105 seats while Shiv Sena has 56 seats in its account
 rakanpa ne 54 siten jeetin or congress ke khate main 44 siten ai hai
 The tussle between the ruling Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress in Uttar Pradesh increased further today when the administration did not allow the Congress program and garlanding the statue of Baba Saheb Ambedkar citing security reasons here

 BSP and Congress programs have been organized here on two different grounds to commemorate the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Ambedkar
 basapa jis maidan main subah das baje se aparaahn chaar baje tak kaarykram yojit kar rahi he vahaan baba sahib kii pratimaa he, lekin congress dwaara 10 baje se do baje ke bich ek anya maidan main kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya ja rahaa he
 On the occasion of Baba Saheb's birth anniversary, the Congress had sought permission to garland the statue of Baba Saheb in the same ground where the BSP is scheduled today, so the administration refused to allow the Congress and said that after the BSP program Congress may be allowed to garland
 congress vidhayak dal ke netaa pramod tiwari kaa aarope he ki is kaarykram ke sanyojak evam faijabad ke saansad nirmal khatri dwaara anumati maange jane ke baavjood prashasan ne anumati dene se inkaar kar diya
 At the same time, District Magistrate of Ambedkar Nagar Kunwar Vikram Singh said that he did not refuse to give permission for the program but due to security reasons, as long as the BSP program goes, another program cannot be allowed
 bhagava party main aise netaaon kii kami nahin he, jo chunaavon main surakshit seat paane ke chakkar main rahete hai
 Although BJP President Rajnath Singh is an MP from Ghaziabad, he is confident that he will not be able to win again from here in 2014
 ve uttar pradesh, khaskar lakhanu se chunaav laduya chaahate hai
 This is not only because it is a strong stronghold of BJP, but also because former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had won this seat five times till 2009
 party ke kuch netaa bataate hai ki rajnath kis tarah khud ko aglaa vaajapeyi samaj rahe hai
 a senior leader says, "they understand that they are good speakers and like Vajpayee are acceptable to all constituents
 ” bijepi main baaki bhi yahi sochate hai? The world's best finisher Mahendra Singh Dhoni said after the close defeat in the first ODI at the hands of England that his team would have easily achieved the target of 326 runs if he had survived a few more overs
 tippaniyan India could not replicate the feat shown at Lord's here ten years ago but the target looked easy when captain Dhoni and Suresh Raina were playing
 dhoni ne match ke baad kaha, ‘lakshya mushkil tha lekin hamen ise hasil karnaa chahie tha
 We expected a target of not more than 320 runs but 280 or 290 runs as the outfield was fast
 mujhe kuch or over ballebaaji kerani chahie thi

 According to sources related to NDTV, there were deep differences between the two on various issues which resulted in Kumble's resignation
 kumble ke istife ke baad ab team india or bisisiai kaa dhyaan nae coach ke chayan par tik gaya he
 According to the information, Virender Sehwag, Ravi Shastri, Tom Moody, Richard Pybus, Lalchand Rajput, etc
 have submitted their claim for the post of coach
 coach ke chayan ke mudde par kai purv cricketron ne bhi apni raay jaahir kii he
 Sanjay Manjrekar, former middle-order batsman and commentator of Team India, wants captain Kohli to be taken into confidence when choosing the new coach of Team India, keeping in mind the current controversy
 unhone kaha, bhale hi captain ko coach chayan kii prakriya kaa hissaa nahin banaaya jaae lekin use is maamle main bharose main liya janaa chahie
 Considering the events so far, best to keep Virat in the loop while appointing India coach
 That would be the sensible thing to do
 - Sanjay Manjrekar (@sanjaymanjrekar) June 28, 2017 ek twit ke jariye unhone yah vichaar jataae
 Former Team India coach Gary Kirsten has also expressed his opinion on the matter
 unhone twit ke jariye kaha ki

 isamen se kuch anil kumble ke paksh main hai to kuch captain kohli ke paksh main raay de rahe hai
 The last date to apply for the post of coach is set to be 9 July and a three-member advisory committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has to decide in this regard

 In some, the disease comes as a problem of eyes or kidneys

 Living ahead of time has become a habit as today, at the age of 19, Nischal Narayanam is the youngest chartered accountant in the country
 itani kahani sunakar aapako aisa lag saktaa he naraayanam ko roak paanaa mushkil he, lekin aisa nahin he 19 saal kii umr main chartd acountint kii degree paane ke baad bhi nishchal tab tak ek profeshnal CA ke taur par practice nahin kar sakate hai jab tak ki ve 21 saal ke nahin ho jate
 This is because the law of the country does not allow them
 enditivi se baat karte hue apni is safalataa ke bare main naraayanam ne bataaya, 'mujhe bahut pehle hi ye ehsaas ho gaya tha ki agar main apane samay ko sahi tarah se manage kar letaa hum to main apane umr ke chaatro se zyada hasil kar saktaa hum
 Apart from this, i also got some teachers who used my talent properly
 ' so
 
 
 
 If your child complains about the work-load of studies and exams, then give this information to him, Nischal had completed the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th exam all in one academic year and then his age was just 13 years
 And the university was Cambridge University
 or shaayad itnaa bhi kam tha, 15 saal kii umr main naraayanam ne apane pita kii madad se ek company banaai
 This company diagnoses the problems of millions of schools across the country and has an annual turnover of 100 million
 naraayanam kehete hai, 'is dauraan mujhe ehsaas hua ki, agar aap kuch sunate hai to aap sikhte hai, dekhte hai to behatar sikhte hai or agar aap khud kuch karte hai to phir use kabhi nahin bhoolatey

 The film 'enemy' begins with the recovery of crores of rupees from the builder's lobby, but someone else loots those money
 is lut kii vajah se shuru hota he, gangvaar or suspence ki aakhir karodon rupee kisne luute? The film depicts Mumbai's hooliganism, gang war, police encounter and CBI investigation
 film main ek ahm role nibhaa rahe hai, mithun chakravarti
 Sunil Shetty, KK Menon, Johnny Lever and the superintendent of police are in the role
 film main dher sara ection he, lekin suspence barkaraar rakhane main film naakaam rahi he
 'enemy' also tries to show how politicians extort money from industrialists to contest elections
 film main sabhi kalakaaron ne mehnat kii he, magar kahani kamjor he
 The comments diarector ashu trikha ne ection par jitna dhyaan diya he, agar utana hi dhyaan script par bhi dete to film behatar banati
 Looking at 'enemy', it seems that the film is made for single screen and maybe the same audience will also turn to this film
 mithun chakravarti ke phans unhen unke bete ke saath dekhne ke liye film dekh sakate hai
 Apart from this, Sunil Shetty, who has an action image, can turn to the cinema hall of small towns
 isliye 'anemi' ke liye reating he, 2
 5 stars film main mumbai kii gundgardee, gangvaar, police muthbhed or sibiai kii tafteesh dikhaai gai he
 Mithun Chakraborty is playing an important role in the film
 sunil shetty, keke menon, johny liver or mahakshay police afasar kii bhumika main hai
 There is a lot of action in the film, but the film has failed to maintain suspense
 'anemi' main yah bhi dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he ki kis tarah rajaneta udyogpatiyon se chunaav ladane ke liye paison kii jabaran vasuuli karte hai
 All the actors have worked hard in the film, but the story is weak
 tippaniyan Director Ashu Trikha has given as much attention to the action, if he had paid as much attention to the script, the film would have been better
 'anemi' ko dekhakar aisa lagata he ki film single screen ke liye banaai gai he or shaayad vahi darshak is film kii taraf rukh bhi karen
 Mithun Chakraborty's fans can watch the film to see him with his son
 iske alaava ection kii image rakhane vaale sunil shetty kii vajah se chote shaharon ke darshak cinema haul kii taraf rukh kar sakate hai
 Hence the rating for 'enemy' is, 2
 5 stars
 There is a lot of action in the film, but the film has failed to maintain suspense
 'anemi' main yah bhi dikhaane kii koshish kii gai he ki kis tarah rajaneta udyogpatiyon se chunaav ladane ke liye paison kii jabaran vasuuli karte hai
 All the actors have worked hard in the film, but the story is weak
 tippaniyan Director Ashu Trikha has given as much attention to the action, if he had paid as much attention to the script, the film would have been better
 'anemi' ko dekhakar aisa lagata he ki film single screen ke liye banaai gai he or shaayad vahi darshak is film kii taraf rukh bhi karen
 Mithun Chakraborty's fans can watch the film to see him with his son
 iske alaava ection kii image rakhane vaale sunil shetty kii vajah se chote shaharon ke darshak cinema haul kii taraf rukh kar sakate hai

 arijit ke gane ko film se hataa die jane ko lekar shuruyaat se hi ise singer kii salmaan ke saath anban kaa nateeja bataaya ja rahaa he
 However, talking about the latest gossip regarding this news, there have been reports from the source that Salman himself is surprised by the news of Arijit's dismissal of his songs

 After that, now in the year 2017, he has directed the Daddy film
 unhone mumbai ke purv gangster or politician arun gavali ke jivan kii ghatnaon ko dikhaane kii koshish kii he
 Story: This story is of Arun Gulab Gawli (arjun Rampal)
 uski kahani kis tarah se mumbai ke bhaikhla ilaake kii ek chol se shuru hoti he jise anderworld main 'daddy' ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 This is what has been tried to show through this film
 arun ke upar chal rahe aapraadhik maamalon ke saath hi parivaar kii sthiti or ilaake ke logon ke saath uske talmail ko dikhaaya gaya he
 Inspector Vijaykar Nitin (nishikant Kamat) and Maqsood (farhan Akhtar) also have important roles in the film

 film kii casting bhi kaaphi hili-duli he
 On the one hand, there is director Nishikant Kamat as Inspector who is seen playing his character accurately in many scenes, but taking Farhan Akhtar as Maqsood seems completely misscasting
 darasal, film main arun gavali kaa naa hi gangster or naa hi robinhood vaala role nyaaysangat ban paaya he
 If more work was done on the screenplay, the film would have looked even better
 isliye dekh sakate hai film :arjuna rampal kaa luk bahut acha he
 He has played the character of Arun Gawli well
 yah unke kariyar kaa sabase acha role he
 The work of Aishwarya Rajesh, Rajesh Shringarpure, Anand Ingale and other actors in the film is also fantastic

 This was Muller's ninth goal in the ninth match of the World Cup
 america kaa aapasi talmail sahi nahin tha jiskaa use nuksaan hua
 On one occasion in the second half, clients Demsey and Jeremy Jones were progressing well, but missed a good chance due to lack of consistency
 america kaa agle daur main pahunchnaa lagbhag tay ho gaya tha or isliye usne aakhri kshanon main gol karne kii betaabi dikhaane ke bajaay gol nahin khaane par bhi dhyaan diya

 'eke antni ne sansad main mangalvaar ko apane bayaan main pakistani sena kaa naam lene bajaay kaha tha ki hamale main shaamil log 'pakistani sena kii uniform' main the
 Since Antony's speech in Parliament, these questions are arising that why did he refer to the attackers as 'people in the uniform of Pakistani army'? The BJP opposed this in Parliament and said that we ourselves have given a way to Pakistan to escape

 In the controversy, Akshay's daughter Nitara's name was used in such a way that the name of Akshay's daughter Nitara was also dragged by Aamilika Dua in a blog written about Akshay's statement

 He wrote- For the past 24 hours, Akshay Kumar's fans have been calling me good and bad on social media
 dekhne se lag rahaa he ki ye akshay ke phens to nahin, lekin us tarah ke log hai, jo mahilaon se bhaddi baaten karte hai
 People are saying that 'so much fun goes on'
 ' mallika ne blog main poocha, 'kya unka yah statement kisi ko ancomfortable karne ke liye upyukt tha
 If someone used to tell their daughter, Nitara ji, you play the bell, i play you, then they do not mind
