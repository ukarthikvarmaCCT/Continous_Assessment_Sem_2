 assam main panchayat chunaav zyada tadak-bhadak vaale kabhi nahin rahe
 So the BJP started using at least three helicopters for campaigning in the rural elections held on 5 and 9 December, all were surprised as this was happening for the first time in the state
 lagbhag do hafton tak, mukhyamantri sarbanand sonoval or vitt mantri hemanth biswa sarama ne pradesh ke doordaraj ilaakon kii hawaii yatra kii or panchayat chunaavon main logon se party ke liye samarthan maanga
 The party has taken these elections very seriously like any other election
 donon netaaon ne vyaktigat rup se party kii chunavi taiyaariyon par najar banaae rakhi
 The BJP, which came to power for the first time in the state by winning 60 out of the 126 assembly seats in 2016, ran such an aggressive campaign even in these local elections, the biggest reason behind it - the controversial Citizenship (amendment) Bill 2016
 party ko ashanka thi ki kahin yah vidheyak pradesh main party kii sambhaavnaaon par grahan na laga de
 Ever since the bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 19 July 2016, there have been large-scale protests in Assam, particularly in the Brahmaputra Valley
 yahaan 60 sanghathanon ne 23 aktubar ko samuhik band kaa aahvaan kiya tha jiskaa khaasaa asar dekhne ko mila
 The state BJP government had issued orders to keep offices and schools open, yet the roads were deserted and offices and shops remained closed
 assam ke sabase prabhaavshaalee saamaajik samooh, ol assam student union ke mukhya salaahkaar samujjal bhattacharya kehete hai, ''hamane udaartaa dikhaate hue 1971 se pehle se assam main rah rahe avaidh apravasiyon ko sweekaar kar liya lekin ab ham dharm ke naam par or logon ko apane yahaan nahin basaa sakate
 This bill is a conspiracy of the BJP
 assam ke logon ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko saat siten or 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaav main baari janadesh diya
 Instead, the BJP is now deceiving the people of Assam
 ''vahiin bhaajapa kii sahyogi assam gana parishad (agypi) panchayat chunaav akele lard rahi he
 She is also a constant attacker on the bill and has threatened to end her alliance several times
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah assam main rah rahe avaidh bangladeshi apravasiyon kii pahchaan ke liye supreme court kii dekharekh main nagarikon ke rashtriya register (enarasi) ko apadet karaae jane kaa credit lene kii koshish main rahe jabaki agypi ne shah par assam ke hiton kii andekhi karke asamiya logon ke saath dhokhaa karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Shah had said that the NRC was the 'soul' of the Assam Accord signed in 1985 between the central government and the leaders of the Assam movement for six years to resolve the issue of infiltrators from Bangladesh
 is par pratikriya dete hue agypi ke adhyaksh or cabinet mantri atul bora ne kaha, ''amit shah ne enarasi ko assam samjhaute kii aatma mana, main iske liye unhen dhanyavad detaa hum par is aatma ko surakshit rakhane ke liye modi sarkaar ko chaar pretatmaon—naagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak, 2016; passport (bharat main pravesh) sanshodhan niyam, 2015; videshi (sanshodhan) aadesh, 2015 or pakistan tathaa bangladesh ke logon ke liye dirghakaalik vija ko tatkaal band karnaa hoga
 Any attempt by the central government to grant Indian citizenship to illegal immigrants from the backdoor through amendment of citizenship laws and passport rules would end the original intent to update the NRC
 ''sonoval sarkaar zyada pareshaan isliye bhi he kyonki is adhyadesh se united libration front of assam (ulpha) ke paresh barua ke netritv vaale gut ko apni jaden phir se jamaane main madad mil rahi he
 According to media reports, in the last six months at least 50 youth from Assam, including a software engineer, a state-level athlete and AASU district-level leader, have joined the ULFA
 unamem se kai ne soshal media par daawa kiya ki rajya sarkaar assam ke bhavishya ko daanv par laga rahi he, isliye assam ke bhavishya ko avaidh apravasiyon se bachaane ke liye unhone aisa kadam uthaaya
 However, the state police officials claim that the number of new recruits in the ULFA has been exaggerated in the media
 assam police kii vishesh shakha ke ek sheersh adhikari kehete hai, ''har saal, kuch asantusht yuvak or yuvatiyaan ulpha main shaamil hoti hai
 We have reports that 11 youths joined the ULFA this year while 15 were on the way to join them but in time we caught them and showed them the right path
 is saal ek alag chalan yah dekha ja rahaa he ki soshal media or paaramparik media inaki sankhya badha-chadhaakar pesh kar rahaa he or ise vidheyak ke khilaaf naaraazgi se jodakar pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 "new people joining ULFA are sensationally proclaiming their intentions by uploading their pictures and videos with weapons on social media, which is a new trend
" ulpha pramukh barua ne dhamkee di he ki vah is vidheyak ke virodh main aatanki gatividhiyon ko anjaam degaa
 However, the ULFA refused to take responsibility for the killing of five Bangladeshi Hindu farmers at the hands of unidentified gunmen near Tinsukia on 1 November
 is saal july se lekar ab tak assam ke vibhinn hisson main teen kam tivrata vaale bam visphot bhi hue hai
 Opposition parties have blamed the BJP government for deteriorating law and order
 congress vidhayak dal ke netaa debabrat saciya kehete hai, ''rajya main bhaajapa kii aguai vaali sarkaar or centre asamiya logon kii bhaawanaaon ko nazarandaaj karke naagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak ke saath aage bad rahe hai
 This leaves the youth of Assam disappointed and joining the ULFA in response
 ''assam main vyapak dar he ki agar prastaavit vidheyak lagu hota he to bangladesh se aae bahut se avaidh hindu apravasiyon ko bharat kii naagarikta mil jaaegi or isi ashanka main asamiya-varchasv vaali brahmaputra ghati main bahut virodh dekha ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, the governments of Meghalaya and Mizoram have also strongly opposed the bill and passed resolutions against it
 bhaajapa is vidheyak ke jariye bangladesh se aae avaidh musalamaanon kii kaat taiyaar karke assam kii hindu pahchaan kii raksha karne kii ranneeti par chal rahi he
 But Assamese people feel that their cultural heritage may be in danger due to Hindu Bengalis
 sarkaar unke is dar ko dur karne main vifal rahi he
 The number of Bengali speakers in Assam is continuously increasing and this has deepened the suspicion of the Assamese people
 is kshetra main asamiya or bengali samudaayon ke bich saamaajik-saanskrithik pratidwandvita kaa lanbaa itihaas rahaa he
 Between 1991 and 2011, the number of Assamese speakers decreased from 58 percent to 48 percent while the number of Bengali speakers increased from 22 percent to 29 percent
 hindu bengaaliyon ke prabhutv vaale assam kii baraak ghati main, asamiya ko abhi bhi aadhikarik bhashaa ke rup main sweekaar nahin kiya gaya he
 For Sonowal, the hero (and one gift) of Assamese sub-nationalism, this will be the toughest hour of the exam: BJP and RSS leadership want to pass the bill without delay, amidst their pressure they feel the insecurity in the minds of Assamese voters Also have to be overcome
 sonoval ne vidheyak ko lekar philhal chuppi saadh rakhi he par sutara bataate hai ki unhone sheersh netritv ke saamne apni ashanka vyakt kar di he
 At the same time, Sarma is among the most vocal supporters of the bill
 sarama kehete hai, ''assam main vidheyak kaa koi virodh nahin hai
 Only a few self-proclaimed intellectuals and a section of the media are crying foul about it
 agypi ko avaidh apravasiyon ke bare main baat karne kaa koi haq nahin he
 The Assam Accord was signed by their leaders
 usee samjhaute kii dein he ki 1971 tak bangladesh se aae saare avaidh apravasiyon ko bharat kaa naagarik sweekaar kar liya gaya tha
 If he was really concerned about the people of Assam, he should have demanded that people from Bangladesh should be treated as citizens of the state, not by 1971 but by 1951
 desh ke baaki rajyon main yahi vyavastha apanaai gai he
 The issue of giving citizenship to persecuted Hindus was an important election promise of the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 iske alaava, baraak ghati kii badi hindu bengali aabaadi bill kaa samarthan karti he or bhaajapa puure rajya main maujuud apana ek vafaadaar vot bank nahin khona chaahati
 If the party fails to pass the bill, the bjp's prospects may be adversely affected even in the Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal, where it is presenting itself as a protector of the Hindu population and Hindu interests
 bhaajapa ke kendriya netritv ko ummid he assam samjhaute ke khand 6 ko lagu karke vah asamiya logon kii chintaaen dur kar degaa
 This section provides constitutional, legislative and administrative protections to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya sachiv ram madhav kehete hai, ''jahaan tak assam kii bhashaayi or saanskrithik pahchaan kaa sawaal he, ham khand 6 ko lagu karke isaki likhit taur par raksha sunishchit karenge
 "at present, the number of those who believe such political promises in Assam will be small because political parties took nearly two decades to update the NRC, another important part of the agreement, and the Supreme Court had to intervene
" jo bhaajapa kashmir main anuchhed 35 e ko chunauti de rahi he, vah khand 6 ko lagu karegi, isko lekar logon main sanshay he
 After heavy protests against the bill in Assam, a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) was constituted to examine its provisions
 jepisi, jise pehle hi chah vistaar die ja chuke hai, ab tak koi amrai kaayam karne main naakaam rahi he
 While the BJP members in the committee are talking about implementing the bill, the opposition members argue that illegal immigrants, whether they are Hindus, should not be given citizenship because religion is not the basis for citizenship decision-making
 can
 aise main is vidheyak ke sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main paas hone kii sambhaavna nahin he, kyonki bhaajapa ke paas rajyasabha main paryaapt bahumat nahin he
 However, the party's performance in the panchayat elections can decide what the party will take regarding the bill
 agar bhaajapa kaa pradarshan acha rahata he to sarama kaa stand sahi sabit hoga or kendriya netritv vidheyak ko teji se aage badhaane kaa prayaas kar saktaa he
 However, Professor Nanny Gopal Mahanta at Guwahati University says, "the bill is now being discussed in public and it is unlikely to have much impact on panchayat elections
" agar bhaajapa virodh ko nazarandaaj karke ise lekar zyada aakraamak ravaiya apanaati he, to 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main uske pradarshan par pratikul prabhaav pad saktaa he
 "besides, if BJP and AGP decide to contest in general elections separately, it will dent bjp's vote bank
" 2016 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa-agypi-bipief (bodoland piples front) kaa gathbandhan tha jisase rajya ke teenon pakshon asamiya, janajaatiy or hindu voton ko ekajute karne main madad mili thi
 To repeat that performance, the two sides will have to work hard to create mutual reconciliation
 bhaajapa ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''philhal to itani talkhi he ki cabinet kii baithkon tak main bhi agypi or bhaajapa netaaon ke bich shaayad hi kabhi baatcheet hoti he
 "they should start the conversation as soon as possible
" thaasantosh ke masalenaagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak, 2016 naagarikta vidheyak, 1955 main sanshodhan kii maang karata he
 The Bill enables illegal infiltrators who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan to enter India to become citizens of India
 yah sanshodhan jaahir taur par un report se prerit hokar laayaa gaya, jinamein kaha gaya tha ki in alpsankhyak samudaayon se aane vaale kai bangladeshi or pakistani nagarikon ko dharmik utpeeda yaa uske dar or ashanka kii vajah se bharat main sharan lene ke liye majaboor kiya gaya he
 The Citizenship Act, 1955 prohibits illegal migrants from acquiring citizenship of India

 Illegal migrants can be jailed or sent back to their country under the Foreigners Act, 1946 and the Passport (entry into India) Act 1920
 ye donon kanoon centre sarkaar ko bharat ke bheetar videshiyon ke aane, jane or rahane par niyam-kaayade lagu karne kaa adhikaar dete hai
 In 2015 and 2016, the central government exempted certain groups of illegal migrants — Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan — from foreign law and passport (entry into India) laws
 Two notifications have been issued
 iskaa matlab yah he ki in samoohon ke avaidh pravaasiyon ko vaid dastavej ke bagaiyr bharat main rahane ke liye na to jail main daalaa jayega or na hi bharat se nikaala jayega
 One of the requirements for a foreigner to obtain citizenship of India under the citizenship law is that the applicant must have been in India for the last 12 months and 11 of the last 14 years
 maujuuda vidheyak unheen chah dharmon or teen deshon ke logon ke liye is 11 saal kii jarurat ko ghataakar chah saal kar detaa he
 The Union Home Ministry has also liberalized the process of granting long-term visas (ltvs) for the minority people of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, and allows them to purchase property in the country, open bank accounts and PAN (permanent Account Number) And allowed to get Aadhaar card
 is vidheyak ke aalochak kehete hai ki yah barabari ke adhikaar kii guarantee dene vaale samvidhan ke anuchhed 14 kaa ulanghan karata he, kyonki yah vidheyak avaidh pravaasiyon ko dharm ke aadhaar par naagarikta ke yogya banaata he

 Congress spokesman Manish Tiwari said that allowing Basit to hold talks with separatist leaders before Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh's visit to Pakistan reflects a lack of diplomacy
 tiwari ne ek angreji channel se kaha, 'pakistani ucchayukta algaavvaadiyon ko vaarta ke liye bula rahe hai

 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra loksabhaa chunaav main party ko jitaane ke liye tabadatod daure kar rahi hai or bhartiya janata party ke netaaon par karaara hamalaa bol rahi hai
 However, during this time, she seems to be avoiding attacking her family
 buudhvaar ko jab priyanka gandhi se menka gandhi ko lekar sawaal kiya gaya, to wo behad chaalaaki se taal gayi
 Maneka Gandhi is a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party and a Union Minister in the Modi government
 wo priyanka gandhi kii chachee lagati hai
 In fact, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh reached Amethi on Wednesday and spoke to party workers
 is dauraan priyanka gandhi media se bhi rubaru huin or kai sawaalon ke jawaab die
 During a conversation with reporters, Priyanka Gandhi fiercely attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, but defied Maneka Gandhi's question very cleverly
 jab priyanka gandhi se menka gandhi ke us bayaan par pratikriya maangi gai, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki priyanka ke upi main aane se koi asar nahin hoga, kyonki congress ke pair jameen par nahin hai
 They do not know what is happening on the ground, so Priyanka Gandhi Gandhi avoided this question very cleverly
 unhone kaha ki agar menka gandhi aisa kuch kah rahi hai, to ye unka najariya he
 At the same time, when Priyanka was asked about Yogi, he immediately retaliated
 unase uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke us bayaan par pratikriya dene ko kaha gaya, jisamen yogi ne kaha tha ki priyanka gandhi ko sirf chunaav main mandiron kii yaad aati he, to is par priyanka gandhi ne tapaak se palatwaar kiya
 He said, 'what does CM Yogi know whether i go to the temple or not
 yaa phir main sirf chunaav ke dauraan mandir jaati hum yaa nahin? unako mere bare main kya pataa?'is dauraan jab priyanka gandhi wadra se poocha gaya ki kya wo is baar loksabhaa chunaav ladengi, to unhone kaha ki agar unki party chaahegi, to wo chunaav jarur ladengi, lekin abhi tak is bare main koi yojana nahin banaai he
 During a conversation with Congress workers in Amethi, he said that Rahul Gandhi will not win the Lok Sabha elections, but will win the country
 priyanka gandhi wadra ne kaha ki abaki baar rahul gandhi na sirf saansad banenge, balki desh ke pradhanmantri bhi banenge
 If left to 1977 and 1998, the Congress has retained the Amethi Lok Sabha seat
 philhal congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi is seat se saansad hai
 From the girl next door in 'rab Ne Bana Di Jodi' to the glamorous model in 'badmaash Company', Anushka Sharma does not want to see her tied up in one role and wants to play roles that any girl can attach herself to 
 anoushka ne kaha, ‘main koi bhi film tab leti hum, jab mujhe uski kahani yaa apni bhoomika pasand aae
 i do not want to tie myself in any one role nor do i want to remember everyone for a particular role
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘main aisi bhoomika nibhaana chaahati hum, jisase duusari ladkiyaan khud ko jod saken
 'anushka was in Delhi recently with debutant artist Ranveer in connection with the promotion of her new film' Band Baaja Baaraat '
 anoushka kii yah film 10 disambar ko relies hone vaali he
 Anushka, who spent the first eight years in Bollywood in the fashion world, said, 'the journey from the ramp to the movies was fun, but to be honest, the world of glamor does not like me very much
 ’ Today is the birthday of a community, not a human
 aaj se 48 saal pehle is dharti par khile the ek divya purush sanjay kapur
 Who said, who is Sanjay Kapoor
 
 
 are apane anil kapur ke munchmunde varjan
 Well now you must be wondering why we are talking about these people whose birth in Bollywood is not remembered by anyone
 darasal yaheen aap galati kar rahe hai
 We have done injustice to a great tradition flag bearer by not giving the footage to Sanjay Kapoor
 sanjay kapur bollywood main bhaichaare ke sabase bade poster bvoy hai
 Brotherhood: Maintaining a sacred relationship with fodder (expenses)
 apane udai baba, sohail miyaan, arbaj bhai or bhi jane kitne is ginati main aate hai
 Due to all these people, the institution of family is alive in India
 bhaaiyon main mohabbat jinda he
 In outside countries, when parents are out, the parents expel the children from their homes that son should go, now earn it yourself
 ham na paalenge tumhen
 In the same country, the elder brother takes care of the younger brother
 salmaan bhai apane do chote mustande bhaaiyon ko paal-pos rahe hai
 Ekta Kapoor is raising Tushar Baba
 udai baba ko rani mukherjee ke poojya pati aditya paal rahe hai
 a lot of dedication is required to spend money from brother throughout his life
 aapako puri shiddat se kuch nahin karne kaa hunar sadhana padataa he
 And have to go through dozens of cute mistakes
 yakeen na ho to ankhen kholkar udai chopra kii kute muskaan or vah elaan yaad kariye
 Acting Quits Me Finally
 yaa allaah
 What a rude confession she was
 aditya ke to aansu se aankh nikal ai baahar
 Well, what is the matter
 apan to jaraa berthde bvoy ke bare main jaan lete hai
 His tragedy starts from the first film
 bhai kii debyue film ‘prem’ kul jamaa paanch saal let thi
 Perhaps that's why a song was already put in it
 'aati nahin aati nahin
 
 
 It is in front but cannot be seen
 ' ye baat or he ki baad main kuchhek saal ye kabj song ke taur par mashhoor hua
 And the film, She To Flop Hone Thi Soi Gaya
 sanjay ke kariyar kii ekmaatr hit film ai to vah bhi bollywood kii dhak-dhak girl maadhuri dikshit ke saath
 But the joke with Sanjay continued unabated here as well
 film kaa naam tha ‘raja’ lekin credit le gai maadhuri
 The psychologists even said that they would have named the film as Rani
 khayr, iske baad bhai filmon se vaise hi gaayab hue jaise gadhe ke sir se sing gaayab hote honge
 These will be, because we haven't seen donkey horns yet
 to unka gaayab hona kaise hi dekhte
 But if you have a phrase, you will have to fulfill it
 kam back king jugal hansraj kii tarah sanjay ne bhi kai baar kambek karne kii koshish kii magar har dfa darshakon ne 'go back' kaa farmaan suna diya
 The last incident was from his film Qayamat
 jahaan bhaichaare ke do anmol nagine sanjay kapur or arbaj khan ek saath the
 This film was even more painful than the wonders that would come on the day of doom
 janhit ke vaaste is film ko jald se jald parade se utaara gaya
 Then the law and order of the country was saved and life and property could be protected
 
 Now brother thought self-respect is also something
 so sabase bade bhai kii sharan main gaye or produsar ho filmon se mukti pai
 History is witness that thousands of people took a bath on this step and recommended Nobel for Human Services
 ant main itnaa hi ki aap ek insaan nahin ek puri kaum hai
 Families may be breaking up all over the world, but you have a huge contribution in saving brotherhood in India
 aaj ke din ko bhaichara diwas ke rup main manaaen or bhailogon kii jaankaree sab tak pahunchaaen
 Although the work is difficult
 kyonki is bhai kii jaankaree jutaney ke liye jab aap vikipedia par jate hai to kamabakht maaraa kahata he 'dis pej haij sam ishyu
 'hey, no one has become great without issue
 ant main ek sher kii lugdi, aapke najar

 He does what he loves
 chaahe wo samaaj ke khilaaf ho, kanoon ke khilaaf ho yaa puri insaaniyat ke khilaaf hi kyon na ho
 That is why the world calls him a dictator
 magar is taanashaah kii taanaashaahee jo aapane ab tak dekhi he
 That is nothing
 jo ham aapako bataa rahe hai, wo krurta kii sari hadein paar kar dene vaala he
 And that's Kim Jong Un's Torture Room
 jahaan insaan jaataa to zindaa he, magar lautataa he laash banakar
 Pick up the date pages and start turning them over and find that person who can be called the world's most cruel, most cruel and most unrelenting person
 yaqinan aapke dimag main kuch naam aane lage honge kuch ke dimag main adolf hitler kaa naam aayaa hoga
 Who tortured and killed millions of Jews in torture camps
 kuch ne abu bakar al bagdadi tassavur kiya hoga
 In whose way of giving death, Yamraj himself also seeks refuge
 yaa phir kuch saddaam hossain ke bare main soch rahe honge
 Thousands of people who had a chemical attack put them to death in one stroke
 yaa kuch joseph stallin, pole pot, idi amin changez khan or maao zedang ke bare main soch rahe honge
 God of cruelty is Kim Jong Unmagar When you reach the name of Kim Jong Un then stop exercising your mind
 kyonki ab aap us insaan tak pahunch chuke hai
 Whose cruelty has neither been mated to date
 na he or na hi shaayad kabhi hoga
 You have every right to be surprised
 ham bhi hue the magar tab tak, jab tak hamaara saamana us sachai se nahin hua
 Whom this dictator did not let the world face
 wo sachai ye he ki berahami ke maamle main na to hitler, na bagdadi, na saddaam or na hi idi amin hi iske kareeb tak pahunchate hai
 People die every day in the torture room
 a victim tells about this dictator's torture room that you can stay there alone waiting for death
 har raat battiyaan bujhane ke baad bhi har kamare se chikhen sunai detii thim
 Because every night someone tried to run away from there
 or pakadaney jane par unhen nanga kar ke badi berahami se raatbhar peeta jaataa he
 The most painful thing is that everyday people are dying merciless death and the world does not even know about it
 ruh kampa dene vaali milti yatnaaengar aapkaa dil kamazor he to abhi bhi ham aap se guzarish karenge ki hamaari is report ko mat padhie or na dekhie
 That's because as you go on
 insaaniyat se aapkaa yakeen uthta jayega
 Because this story is such a dictator of North Korea who with his cruelty has not only injured the bodies of prisoners but also the souls in the jails and torture camps of the country
 or aaj ye kahani unheen zakhmon or kim jong un ke sach se pardaa uthaaegi
 a woman told the dreadful truth
 a suffering woman tells that she wants to tell the world that for God's sake save those who are trapped in those torture camps
 kyonki wo vahiin se bachakar ai he
 He has suffered that pain
 kaidi aisi aisi cell main band hote hai jahaan wo na to baith sakate hai
 Neither can lie nor stand up
 wo kutton ke pinjadon kii tarah the
 And they had to stay there like that
 wo usee main khate the
 Used to defecate in that ye kahani ek do logon kii nahin balki saikadon log hai jo north korea kii jelon yaa yatnaa campon se bhaagane main kaamyaab rahe
 He narrates the story of Kim Jong Un's victimization
 magar cheharaa dikhaane kii himmat rot naam kii mahila ke alaava koi or nahi kar paaya
 Prisoners get rotten food There is so much persecution in the jails and camps that people try to escape
 or wo bina soche samajhen unhen goli maar dete hai
 And the rest of the prisoners are threatened by showing their dead bodies that they will be in the same condition
 khaane ke naam par kaidiyon ko din main sirf ek baar ek katoraa chaaval miltaa he
 So much water is added to it that it becomes oatmeal from rice and smells of rot from it
 bina sunwaayee ke milti he beraham sajanarth korian yatnaa camp is dharti par us jahannam kii tarah he
 Where there is no such thing as humanity
 din main 18-18 ghante kaidiyon se mashiinon kii tarah kaam karaayaa jaataa he
 And refusing work here is like feasting on his painful death
 khaane ke naam par bhi inhen jo miltaa he wo use khaakar kuch dinon main kamazori se hi mar jate hai
 And those who do not eat die of hunger
 kaidiyon ko torchar karne ke liye jin krur tareekon kaa yahaan istemaal kiya jaataa he, uski misaal na to maujuud duniya main or na hi itihaas main kahin nahin milti he
 Breaking any of the rules gets the same punishment without any hearing here
 or wo he maut
 Such cruelty in front of the world is the first time the reality of the cruelty of North Korea's eccentric dictator is coming to the fore
 magar kim jong un ke torchar room di jane vaali yaatnaaon kaa puraa khulaasa abhi baaki he
 How this dictator is wreaking havoc on his prisoners by banning the media
 isaki insaide story ham aapako bataa rahe hai
 And this Inside Story saw the eyes of Lim, who was stationed as a guard in Kim Jong Un's death camp
 wo bataata he ki haathon ko peeche baandhne ke baad ve uske bal pakadakar chehre ko deevaaron or teble par de maarthe the
 He is not a human being
 ek insaan duusare insaan ke saath aisa kaise kar saktaa he
 He has no words to describe the place
 vahaan torchar kii shuruuaat suraj nikalne ke saath hoti he or suraj doobane ke baad tak jari rahati he
 According to the replete with female prisoners, male security guards rape female prisoners
 usne apni ankhon ke saamne hazaron kaidiyon kaa rape or hatya hote dekha he
 Not only this, they are burnt alive
 garbhvatee hone par mahila kaidiyon ko abarshan karne ke liye majaboor kiya jaataa he
 They kick on the stomach of pregnant women
 iske baavjood bhi agar bachche paidaa ho jate the to unhen jinda dafan kar diya jaataa he
 Lim says that it is still difficult to believe that he is alive
 jahaan use rakhaa gaya tha, vahaan insaan nahin rah sakate
 It was the death room
 lim wo hai jinaki kismat acchhee thi or jo north korea ke maut ke shiviron se kisi tarah bhaagane main kaamyaab rahi

 He has seen how his fellow male guards misbehaved with female prisoners like animals
 usne dekha he ki kaise garbhvatee hone par mahila kaidiyon kaa behad krur tareeke se abarshan kar diya jaataa tha
 The whole world is in awe of this revelation of Lim hye-jin
 uttar korea se bhagkar dakshin korea aa chuki lim ne ye khulaasa ek angrezi akhbaar ko die apane intervyuu main kiya he
 Lim described how prisoners in torture camps are killed on a minor matter
 balaatkaar kaa virodh karne par mahilaon ko zindaa jala diya jaataa he

 Film Review: Finding Fan Factor: Deepika Padukone, Arjun Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah, Pankaj Kapoor, Dimple kapadiadirector: Homi Adajanaduration: 1 hour 45 minutes Operating: 4 starts at 5 in a row
 pichley dinon court main ek mukadmaa daakhil hua
 It was said that Sir, Fanny is an English word (read slang)
 iskaa matlab baari putthon se hota he
 And the new generation may be confused with this film title
 court ne apil khaarij kar di
 It is comforting that the wanderings of generations need not be an excuse for the face of a film
 vaise pheni ke is matlab kaa sidhaa asar film main diphl kapaadiya ke kirdaar ke baari nitambon se joda ja saktaa he
 But to stop at this would be something like saying that Hussain was a horse painter
 Film Review: film queen se bollywood ko mil gai nai 'rani' kangana ranotbaharhaal, kissa kotaah ye he ki film finding pheni jabardast he
 Every character in it is unknowingly searching for something lost
 aakhir main unhen milti bhi hai ye chijen
 But many do not even know this
 ye film regular hindi masala film nahin he
 The heroine kisses the hero
 mummy-papa ne kuch twist daale
 Songs
 vichoda or aakhir main sangam hoga hi yaheen
 Therefore, puffers moving towards multiplexes in the hope of typical spices may be disappointed
 magar nai kism kii kahani or umdaa acting ke mureed log is film ko jarur dekhen
 There are many reasons to see this, and can be counted even more
 masalan, hindi cinema ke do sabase jabad actor nasiruddin shah or pankaj kapur isamen hai
 And not only that, every part of its reel is firmly inhabited by air, water and light
 Film Review: krichar 3diankhon ko anant main tikaakar dimple kii ankhon ke korepan par bolte pankaj kapur
 Older Naseeruddin Shah is seen looking at a child who has lost his shoulders after losing everything
 uff, hind waalon
 Someone can tell you that you have seen these two acting
 iske alaava film main deepika or arjuna hai
 Two ducklings descended on the raw pond
 korepan ko bina koshish ke lapete-samete
 The land of the film, a village in Goa, also appears completely broken by fresh dal
 film main dimple kii bechaargi kuch odhi hui si lagati he
 This form of extreme aggressive pity is somewhat complicated
 film kii kahani bhi dilachasp he
 It is like an onion
 kai paraton main basii hui
 There are two widows
 saas rozlin (dimple) or bahu anji (deepika)
 Angie is married to Rosaline's son Gabo
 magar wo shaadi ke 15 minute baad hi god ke paas chalaa gaya
 Angie finds happiness in this exile as well
 apane gaanv ke, ados pados ke logon ko dilasa detii anji ko dekhakar lagata hi nahin ki isaki apni pyaas bujhane ke liye koi sota kabhi foot saktaa he
 But this happens when Savio (arjun), Angie's childhood friend, returns to the village
 savia anji se pyaar karata tha, magar gabo ne pahal kar di or
 
 
 Now there is Angie, Savio, old friendship, old resentment and new, strange hesitation
 inke bich anji ke comarya kii raksha karatin uski saas rozlin bhi hai
 The track of this story changes with the intervention of two crows
 gaanv kaa boodha akelaa post master ferdi ek chitthee paata he
 He himself wrote it 46 years ago
 apni ladi lav pheni ko
 The letter returned without being delivered
 ferdi ko laga ki jeene kii ek ummid laut ai
 Fanny did not even know that Fardy loves her
 usne pheni kii talash kii taiyaari kar lee
 Angie and Savio became partners
 doosraa kaua kuch rangeen kism kaa tha
 Work is also colored
 painter don pedro jo us gaanv main ek nayaa shaahakaar rachane aayaa tha
 Don's insatiable gaze hangs over Madame Rosaline
 to stage set he
 Where the five characters are stuck with each other for different reasons
 sabake apane makasad hai
 And apparently everyone wants to find Fanny wandering from street to street
 is talash main kisi ko pyaar miltaa he, to kisi ko apane kadave sach kaa saamana karne kii himmat
 And finally another anecdote drowns in the sediment of the lake wrapped in a trap
 kisi or ke kaante main funs baahar aane ko
 Finding is a rebellion against the city of Fanny, against the individualism that has come out of the womb of this city, and against the shallow seclusion of this individualism
 yahaan sab ek duusare kii jindagi main dakhal de rahe hai
 All are searching for their inner person with the help of community
 ve ek duusare par cheekhte hai
 Do evil laanat bhejte hai
 But the legs do not stop hindering and helping
 unki chintaaen nae sabab paa badhati rahati hai
 The film also has that indescribably cruel Haas, which it certainly does
 kabhi kisi shaks to kabhi kisi bechaargi kii keemat par ugta
 The film has two songs
 donon hi becoground score kii tarah aate hai
 The first is in the middle of the film and the second, when the names of the people working in the film come up
 kaanon ko barkat mili, aise gane hai ye
 Shoddy deepika kii kamaneey hansi or kaaya se
 Arjun to beleaguered as well
 dialog vity bhi hai or prity bhi
 The screenplay is streamlined and the speed does not slow down anywhere
 homi adzania ne is film se ye sabit kar diya ki cocktail ke pher main vah beeing sirus vaala cinema nahin bhuule hai
 The story is like a text in Finding Fanny, with multiple levels and multiple symbols
 jise aap jitani baar padhenge, utani baar kuch nae arth khulenge

 com / n3f3td9wor Have you ever heard that the Chief Minister of the state should put up a Janata Darbar to communicate and listen to the problems of the people, in the same Janata Darbar, a curtain should be put between the Chief Minister and the public
 sunne main ye ajeeb lagata he, lekin haryana ke karnaam main aisa hi kuch hua he
 The Chief Minister of the state Manohar Lal Khattar may have sat in the Janata Durbar with an army of top officials to listen to and solve the problems of the people, but during this time a white colored curtain was placed between the public and the Chief Minister
 mukhyamantri or janata ke bich main samvaad hua to jarur lekin is dauraan sirf mike par hi log apni samasyaayein bataate rahe or siem bhi parde ke peeche se afasaron ko janata kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karne ke liye nirdesh dete rahe
 However, the entire administration of Karnal has remained silent on the question of why the curtain was put between the CM and the public during this Janata Durbar
 yahaan tak ki jab is mudde ko lekar sarkaar ke kai mantriyon se baatcheet karne kii koshish kii gai to unhone bhi media par is maamle ko bevajaah tool dene kaa aarope lagaate hue kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 However, Renu Bala Gupta, Mayor of Karnal, came forward on the matter and said that for various reasons for security and other reasons, the local administration and police have to make various arrangements during the Janata Durbar of the CM
 is puure maamle ko bevajaah tool naa diya jaae or pardaa lagane ke peeche kai suraksha sambandhi vajah ho sakati hai
 At the same time, Kurukshetra MP Rajkumar Saini, who is angry with the party on this whole matter, said that now it has been more than 4 years for the BJP government in Haryana and now it is not time to cover the curtain but now it is time to lift the curtain
 aise main is tarah ke parde lagane se khatter sarkaar ko koi phayda nahin milane vaala
 The main opposition party of Haryana, the Indian National Lok Dal, also attacked the government and said that why should the Chief Minister not want to communicate directly with the people, they should tell them
 indian neshnal lokdal ke pravaktaa praveen atre ne kaha ki darasal haryana ke siem manohar laal khatter ke paas vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke dauraan janata se kiye gaye vaadon ko ab tak puraa naa karne ko lekar koi jawaab nahin he, isiilie janata se bachane ke liye is tarah kii baaten kii ja rahi hai or janata or siem ke bich main pardaa lagaaya ja rahaa he
 This whole controversy definitely raises this question
 If the Janata Darbar is being set up to listen to the problems of the people, then what is the meaning behind the curtain between the same people and the CM
 agar vajah suraksha he to siem ke janata darbar ke dauraan naa sirf jile kii police balki siem security kaa baari polisbal bhi siem ke aasapaas rahata he
 That is why no one is embracing the reason behind the installation of the curtain
 misr ke shame-al-shaikh se 17 bacchon samet 224 yatriyon ko rus ke saint petersburg le ja rahaa roosi vimaan udaan bharne ke kuch hi der baad sinai prayadweep main durghatnagrast ho gaya

 nae saal main 'big bos' ke pehle episod main salmaan khan ne gharavaalon se kaha ki unhen saal kii shuruyaat sakaaraatmakataa ke saath kerani chahie, iske liye unhone swami om- gaurav chopra or bani je-lopamudra se kaha ki ve ek duusare kii prashansa karenge
 On this occasion, Swami Om kept trying to tell himself big, while Gaurav said that when Swami Om smiles, he looks like children which is his specialty
 vahiin lopamudra ne bani ke bare main kaha ki vah khud ko lekar bahut anushaasit hai or eksrasij, khaanaa sabakuch time par karti hai
 At the same time, Bani said about Lopa that she is very caring and helps everyone by coming forward
 vah apane doston ke liye hameshaa khadi hoti hai
 Salman Khan also clapped on Bani's answer
 iske baad salmaan khan ne gharavaalon se poocha ki unki najar main koun hai jo top 5 main nahin jaaenge, is par jab manu manavir samet zyaadaatar logon ne nitibha kaa naam liya to vah rone lageen
 To this, she said that she feels bad that the people with whom she spends all her time do not have confidence in them
 lagjri bajet ke liye hue 'gaurav-bani sho' par baat karte hue salmaan khan ne gaurav chopra or bani je ko mauka diya ki ve gharavaalon se koi ek sawaal puch sakate hai
 On this Gaurav asked Manveer what he was expecting from him during the task which disappointed him with his answer? To this, Manveer said that he is very settled and always supports the right, so he thought that during the task he would say something that would make him feel that he was worried about Priyanka and Lopa's fight in the house
 baad main salmaan khan ne captency ke liye hue iglu task par baat kii
 Swami Om said that his life was in danger during the task
 task ke dauraan kapade utaarne par salmaan khan ne swami om ko fatkaar lagaai
 When Manu Punjabi talked about Swami Om's attempt to pull Rohan Mehra during the last storm, Swami Om said that if he had to get Rohan out, he knew his weaknesses and would have told him out
 jab salmaan ne unase ek galati puche to vah bataa nahin paae
 Rohan said that he ignores many of his things during the day
 lekin tufaan task ke dauraan swami om ne unhen khinchaa jisase unhen kaaphi chot ai thi or phir agle din flower bed task ke dauraan unhone dobaaraa disturb kiya to unhen gussa aa gaya
 Salman Khan explained to Rohan that he understands that Swami Om's antics were answered by his stamina, but after everything was calm Rohan pushed Swami Om to go which was wrong
 iske baad ghatana ko dekhe bina rohan kaa saport karne or 'big bos' ke faisle ko galat bataane ke liye unhone lopa se sawaal poocha ki bina kuch jane unhen aisa nahin karnaa tha
 He said that he should have explained later that he did wrong
 salmaan khan ne lopa se kaha ki jab rohan bathroom baithe the tab lopa beshak unke saath khadi thim lekin vah jaise munh bana rahi thim or jaise hans rahi thim vah acha nahin lag rahaa tha
 She said that it seemed that she was degrading Rohan
 salmaan ne rohan ko samajhaayaa ki apni image apane haath main he or unhen khud par kaabo rakhana chahie
 After this Salman Khan reprimanded Swami Om that when he was not named in the Flower Bed Task, when it was written in the rule that only Rohan and Manveer would do the task
 aise main vah andar kyon gaye? salmaan ne kaha ki swami om bahut shaatir hai, unhen lagata he ki negative publicity bhi publicity he
 Salman said that the more he talks to Swami Om, the more he will appear on TV
 salmaan ne kaha ki ab se vah swami om se bilkul bhi baat nahin karenge
 After this, TV actor Aamir Ali and former contestant of 'bigg Boss' Diandra Soares joined the guest panel
 donon ne kaha ki unhen manavir or lopa pasand hai
 The two talked about Gaurav and Bani's friendship and the game plan of the family
 diandra ne kaha ki gaurav or bani kii dosti main gaurav kaa efort zyada dikhataa he, aamir ne kaha ki gaurav kaa efort bhi shaayad isliye zyada dikhataa he kyonki vah akele hai
 Aamir said about Rohan that he should not have questioned the decision of 'bigg Boss'
 tippaniyan After this, an AP Fiz caller questioned Nitibha that the way he showed the slippers to Gaurav during the gaurav-bani task, did he not realize that it could spoil his own image
 is par nitibha ne maafee maangi ki shaayad us moment par sahi faisla nahin kar pai, unhone kaha ki vah ek mazaakia lahaze main gai thim haalanki yah unki galati he or iske liye unhone gaurav se maafee maangi
 After this, 'bigg Boss' told the family that they would complete the process of homelessness
 iske tahat teenon main se ek sadsy ghar se baahar ho jayega
 Firstly, 'bigg Boss' declared Monalisa safe
 iske baad unhone gaurav or bani ko activity aria main bulaayaa or unki dosti ke khaas palon kaa ek video un donon or gharavaalon ko dikhaaya or kaha ki ghar ke andar yah aakhri din he jab ve donon ek saath hai
 He then told both of them that Gaurav would go out of the house
 gaurav ke ghar se jane par unke virdohi kahe jane vaale manu or manavir bhi imotional ho gaye
 After this, Salman Khan asked the family members who were his eyes, who would not go in the top 5, but when most people including Manu Manveer named Nitibha, she started crying
 is par unhone kaha ki unhen kharaab lag rahaa he ki jin logon ke saath vah apana puraa vakt bitaati hai unhen hi un par confidence nahin he
 Talking about the 'gaurav-bani Show' for the luxury budget, Salman Khan gave Gaurav Chopra and Bani j a chance to ask the family a question
 is par gaurav ne manavir se poocha ki task ke dauraan vah unase kya ummid kar rahe the jo unhen unke jawaab se niraashaa hui? is par manavir ne kaha ki vah kaaphi sulajhe hue hai or hameshaa sahi kaa saath dete hai, isliye unhen laga tha ki task ke dauraan ve kuch aisa kahenge jisase lagegaa ki vah ghar main hue priyanka or lopa kii ladaai ko lekar chintit the
 Later Salman Khan spoke on the Igloo task for the Captaincy
 swami om ne kaha ki task ke dauraan unki jaan ko khatra tha
 Salman Khan reprimanded Swami Om for removing clothes during the task
 manu punjabi ne jab aakhri tufaan ke dauraan swami om dwaara rohan mehara ko khinchne kii koshish ke bare main baat kii to swami om ne kaha ki unhen rohan ko nikaalnaa hota to unhen unki itani kamajoriyaan pataa hai ki unhen bataakar baahar nikaal dete
 When Salman asked him a mistake, he could not tell
 rohan ne kaha ki din main unki kai baaten ve ignor karte hai
 But during the storm task, Swami Om pulled him due to which he was badly hurt and then he got angry when he disturbed again during the Flower Bed task the next day
 salmaan khan ne rohan ko samajhaayaa ki vah samajhate hai ki swami om kii harkaton kii vajah unki sahanshakti ne jawaab de di, lekin sabakuch shant hone ke baad rohan ne swami om ko jaakar dhakka diya jo ki galat tha
 He then asked Lopa questions to support Rohan without seeing the incident and to make the 'bigg Boss' decision wrong, that he was not supposed to do it without knowing anything
 unhone kaha ki unhen baad main samajhaana chahie tha ki unhone galat kiya
 Salman Khan told Lopa that when Rohan was sitting in the bathroom, Lopa was of course standing with him but she did not look good as she was mouthing and laughing
 unhone kaha ki aisa lag rahaa tha ki vah rohan ko nicha dikhaa rahi hai
 Salman explained to Rohan that his image is in his hand and that he should control himself
 iske baad salmaan khan ne swami om ko fatkaar lagaai ki flower bed task main jab unka naam nahin tha, jab rule main likhaa tha ki rohan or manavir hi task karenge
 So why did he go inside? Salman said that Swami Om is very vicious, he feels that negative publicity is also publicity
 salmaan ne kaha ki jitna vah swami om se baat karenge, vah tivi par utane hi zyada dikhaai denge
 Salman said that from now on he will not talk to Swami Om at all
 iske baad tivi abhinayta aamir ali or 'big bos' kii purv pratibhaagi diandra sores guest panel main shaamil hue
 Both said that they like Manveer and Lopa
 donon ne gaurav or bani kii dosti or gharavaalon ke game plan ke bare main baat kii
 Diandra said that Gaurav's effort is seen more in the friendship between Gaurav and Bani, Aamir said that Gaurav's effort is also seen more because he is single
 aamir ne rohan ke bare main kaha ki unhen 'big bos' ke faisle par sawaal nahin uthaanaa chahie tha
 The comments iske baad ek api fiz collar ne nitibha se sawaal kiya ki gaurav-bani task ke dauraan jis tarah unhone gaurav ko chappal dikhaai kya unhen realyse nahin hua ki usase unki khud kii image kharaab ho sakati he
 At this, Nitibha apologized that she could not make a right decision on that moment, saying that she had gone in a funny tone though it is her fault and for this she apologized to Gaurav
 iske baad 'big bos' ne gharavaalon se kaha ki ve ghar se beghar hone kii prakriya ko puraa karenge
 Under this, one of the three members will be out of the house
 sabase pehle 'big bos' ne monalisa ko surakshit ghoshit kiya
 He then called Gaurav and Bani to the activity area and showed a video of the special moments of their friendship to both them and the family members and said that this is the last day inside the house when they are together
 iske baad unhone donon ko bataaya ki gaurav ghar se baahar jaaenge
 Manu and Manveer, who were said to be his opponents after leaving Gaurav's house, also became emotional
 lagjri bajet ke liye hue 'gaurav-bani sho' par baat karte hue salmaan khan ne gaurav chopra or bani je ko mauka diya ki ve gharavaalon se koi ek sawaal puch sakate hai
 On this Gaurav asked Manveer what he was expecting from him during the task which disappointed him with his answer? To this, Manveer said that he is very settled and always supports the right, so he thought that during the task he would say something that would make him feel that he was worried about Priyanka and Lopa's fight in the house

 The farm house in Satara area of maharashtra is spewing another nitri from inside
 doctor santosh pole pehle apane shikaar ko farm house par laata tha
 Then he would be injected with an overdose of drugs on his own
 us injection main aisi dawa hoti ki injection lagane ke bas kuch minute ke andar hi saamne vaala besudh ho jaataa
 Leave it shaking inside, there is no strength left even by blinking the eyelids
 tab aisi haalat main wo unhen uthaa kar sidhe jinda hi gadde main dafna detaa
 Confession to bury six people alive The doctor has now confessed to burying six people alive in the tomb by giving an overdose of injection
 doctor pole ne apane farm house kaa naam puru rakhaa tha
 Puru Farm House
 marathi main 'puru' kaa matlab gaadna hota he or pole sachmuch yahaan insaanon ko jinda hi gaad rahaa tha
 According to the state police, the truth that has been revealed in the inquiry so far is extremely frightening
 doctor santosh pole apane har shikaar ko maarane kaa plan kai-kai din pehle bana letaa tha
 He would have decided in advance by the date of his death
 phir bahaane se unhen apane farm house par bulaata
 After this, in the name of treatment, he would be given such a dose of medicine through injection that the front would become insensitive
 iske baad usee haal main wo unhen apane farm house main dafna detaa or phir uske upar nariyal kaa ped laga detaa
 According to the land occupied by the Maharashtra Irrigation Department, the farm house, which was built by Dr
 Pol Neckbristan, is also not his own
 maharashtra sinchai vibhaag kii jameen par usne avaidh rup se kabja kar rakhaa tha
 He deliberately opened a poultry farm inside the police farm house and started raising chickens
 planning ke tahat farm house main kholaa poltrie farmdactor pole ko shaq tha ki laashen dafnane ke baad bhi badboo baahar aa sakati he or isse aasapaas ke logon ko pataa chal saktaa he
 The smell coming from the chickens and their eggs would have suppressed the stench of the corpses
 bas isiilie doctor pole ne puri planning ke tahat farm house main poltrie farm kholaa tha
 
 
 
 to isliye lagaataa tha nariyal kaa pedpulice ke mutabik har laash dafnane ke baad uske uparnariyal kaa ped lagane kii vajahabhi doctor pole ne bataa di he
 In fact, many days before every murder inside the farm house, Doctor Pol used to ask for big machines for digging
 aasapaas ke logon ko shaq naa ho isliye wo unhen yahi bataata tha ki farm house ke andar nariyal kaa ped lagaana he, jiske liye jameen kii khudaai kii jaani he
 Every coconut tree would be dug under, then after every murder he literally planted a coconut tree on the corpse
 police ke mutabik is vakt farm house ke andar 25 se zyada nariyal ke ped hai
 So is there a corpse under every tree? At this point of time, the police say that they are constantly questioning Dr Pol and if necessary, during the investigation, excavation will be done under every coconut tree inside the farm house
 paison ke laalach main bana serial killerasatara police kii maane to ab tak kii tafteesh main jo baaten saamne ai hai uske mutabik santosh pole sirf or sirf paison ke laalach main hi serial killer ban gaya
 Eight different teams of the Satara Police are currently trying to research the truth of the poll

 aisa lagata he ki desh main sabase dhime project puure karne kaa shrey har jagah emsidi hi lenaa chaahati he
 That is why the Rani Jhansi flyover being built for 20 years was inaugurated and now it took 10 years to build the Kishanganj railway under bridge
 guuruuvaar ko kendriya mantri harshavardhan bijepi ke tamaam netaaon ke saath uttari dilli ke kishanganj ilaake main pahunche or vahaan ek railway under brij kaa udghaatan kiya
 The minister did read long and long verses in the speech but forgot to tell that this bridge has been constructed for 10 years
 darasal, is under brij ke nirmaan kii shuruyaat june 2008 main hui thi tab se yah pul lagaataar dhimi gati se ban rahaa he
 Taking the credit, North Delhi Mayor Adesh Gupta said that this time the MCD government completed such works which were incomplete for many years
 lekin mushkilen bhi kam nahinuttari dilli nagar nigam ne bataaya ki 30 june 2008 ko shuru hui is pariyojna ke liye 200 dukaanon, 02 transforgers / sab stesan or 05 dharmik sthalon ko vaikalpik sthaan dekar sthanantarit karnaa padaa he
 Actually, the total cost of the Kishanganj RUB project was 41
 43 karod rupe he or ise uttar railway, dilli jal board, bisies, andipiel se sahyog se banaaya gaya he
 That is to say, the more the department, the more time is spent for this construction
 baharhaal, ek baat to saaf he ki bhale hi dilli emsidi desh kii rajdhani main ek ahm hisse main sarkaar chalaati ho lekin iske baavjoodemasidiki karypranali kisi gramin ilaake kii sanstha se kam nahin he
 The Lokpal bill will be placed before the cabinet for approval today
 khaas baat ye he ki lokapal kaa bill nae praaroop main saamne aa rahaa he or sarkaar kaa daawa he ki is par tamaam siyaasi dalon kii sahmati he or cabinet kii manjuuri ke baad ise sansad se paas karaane main dikkat nahin aegi
 However, Anna Hazare, who started the movement for Lokpal, is still suspicious of the intention of the government
 jis lokapal kaa anna ne alakh jagaaya, jo lokapal sansad hangaame kaa gavaah bana vahi lokapal aaj nae praaroop main cabinet ke saamne laayaa ja rahaa he or ummid he ki use cabinet kii hari jhandi mil jaaegi
 How is the new bill of Lokpal different from the old one? 1
 nae bill main rajyon main lokayukta banane kaa adhikaar rajya sarkaron par chhod diya gaya he, jabaki puraane bill main rajya sarkaron ke liye saal bhar ke bheetar lokayukta kii niyukti jaruri thi
 State governments had strongly opposed it as an interference in their authority
 2
 According to the new bill, five people will be appointed together with the Lokpal
 jinamein pradhanmantri, netaa vipaksh, supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish, loksabhaa adhyaksh shaamil honge iske alaava paanchvaan sadsy piem or netaa vipaksh dwaara chunaa gaya koi nyayavid hoga
 In the first appointment PAN, only the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition, Chief Justice of Supreme Court and Speaker of Lok Sabha were kept
 3
 The new bill empowers the Lokpal to run cases against government employees
 pehle ye adhikaar sarkaar ke paas tha
 4
 nae bill main dharmik sansthaaon ko chhod sabhi enjio ko lokapal ke daayre main rakhaa gaya he
 All ngos in the old bill were outside the Lokpal
 5
 The new bill will give government officials a chance to present their case before the Lokpal before the inquiry
 pehle unke paas ye adhikaar nahin tha
 6
 iske alaava sarkaar ne select cameti kii ye sifarish bhi maan lee he ki sibiai ke diarector of prosicution kii niyukti sivisi kare
 7
 sarkaar ne ye bhi maan liya he ki sibiai ke jo adhikari lokapal dwaara saunpi jaanch kar rahe hogen, unke tabadale se pehle lokapal ke saath bhi baatcheet kii jaaegi
 Significantly, the Lokpal bill that the government was bringing before it passed in the Lok Sabha but got stuck in the Rajya Sabha
 tab sarkaar ne ise select kamity ke paas vichaar ke liye bheja tha
 Now the Lokpal Bill which is being considered by the Cabinet, all the suggestions of the Select Committee of Rajya Sabha have been included in it
 sarkaar ko bharosa he nayaa bill bagaiyr aadchan ke paas ho jayega, lekin patna se janakranti kaa shankhanaad foonkane vaale anna ko abhi bhi sarkaar kii niyat saaf nahin lag rahi
 While the government has clearly stated its intention
 lihaaja nigahen cabinet baithak par tik gai he
 This is definitely a big day for the Lokpal movement

 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan will now reach door to door through milk

 This proposal is yet to be approved by Chauhan

 Milk, curd, whey, ghee, shrikhand, lassi, peda, etc
 are prominent in this

 Federation President Subhash Mandge said that the proposal is yet to be approved by the Chief Minister
 manjuuri milane ke baad sanchi ke sabhi dugdh utpaadon par mukhyamantri chouhan kii tasviir najar aane lagegi
 Mandge says that due to the efforts of Chief Minister Chauhan, there has been a significant change in the area of milk production in the state
 ab madhya pradesh kii ginati desh ke bade dugdh utpaadakon main hone lagi he
 In the state where earlier only seven percent milk producers were associated with the committees, now their share has increased to 12 percent
 beete teen varsho main mukhyamantri dwaara dugdh utpaadakon ko di gai sahuliyaton se samitiyon kaa dayera paanch fisadi badha he, ab ise 30 pratishat tak le jane kaa he
 This would be the ideal situation
 unhone bataaya he ki rajya main krishi poorak vyavsaay ke taur par doodh utpaadan ko vishesh mahatv mila he
 The result of getting good milk prices is that 10 lakh liters of milk is being collected daily in the state and now it is likely to increase to 15 lakhs
 dugdh utpaadan ke kshetra main aae badlaav kaa shrey mahasang mukhyamantri chouhan ko detaa he
 Mandge said that at the meeting of the Cooperative Cell, as soon as BJP state president Prabhat Jha brought the proposal to make Chauhan a brand ambassador, the federation immediately accepted it
 mahasang dwaara paarit prastaav ko mukhyamantri chouhan ke paas bheja jayega or unki manjuuri milane ke baad hi is par amal kiya jayega
 He says that due to increasing milk production in the state, better marketing is also needed and further efforts will be made in this direction
 mukhyamantri chouhan agar mahasang ke prastaav ko manjuuri de dete hai to unki tasviir sanchi dugdh utpaadon ke jariye har ghar tak pahunchane lagegi
 This will probably be the first time that Chauhan's picture will reach people through a product

 yah mulaakaat aise samay hui he, jab dharna par baithe dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke samarthan main mamata saamne ai hai jabaki congress aam aadmi party ko lekar alag rukh apanaae hue he
 The Congress questioned Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal for not allowing Kejriwal to meet with non-bjp four Chief Ministers including Mamta, but instead of supporting Kejriwal with the remaining opposition parties, he (kejriwal) attacked him fiercely
 isliye milane pahunche ahmadais mudde par mamata kah chuki hai ki sangheey dhaanche kii raksha ke liye vah kejariwal ke samarthan main hai, ab congress kyon nahin saath aa rahi unase puuchhie
 Sensing this attitude of Mamta, Ahmed Patel himself went and met Mamta
 congress kaa bijepi ko sandeshdarasal, congress philhal bijepi or endie ko samooche vipaksh kii ekajutata kaa sandesh dete rahanaa chaahati thi
 In such a situation, on the issue of Kejriwal in Delhi, she does not want to undermine the solidarity being built against the BJP at any cost
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi hogi ki congress ne ahamed patel ke jariye mamata banerjee ke rukh ko bhaanpate hue fouran trinmul kii mukhiya se milakar kisi tarah kii galatfahami ko dur karnaa zyada munasib samajha
 According to Congress sources, during this meeting Ahmed Patel also discussed future strategies with Mamta
 gauratlab he ki arvind kejariwal ke dharne par chaar rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon ne khulkar samarthan de diya
 On Saturday at Kejriwal's residence, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister n Chandrababu Naidu, Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy and Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had asked the Center to resolve the 'crisis' immediately
 unhone kaha, ‘‘vah jab bhi gend detaa he to main aashwast hota hum ki mujhe vah milegaa jo main chahta hum or hameshaa meraa samarthan kiya jayega
 And it's not just between me and him
 mujhe lagata he ki usne team ke prayek sadsy ke saath aisa kiya he
 Whatever he supported, he fully supported and helped him cross the barrier

 (pitiai se input) Actor Randeep Hooda's film 'main Aur Charles' is going to be released soon in which he is going to appear in the 1986 Tihar jail breaker 'charles Sobhraj', we have some special conversation with Randeep, here are the highlights -you are going to appear in another biopic? This is not a biopic, this is the story of a man who escaped from a jail break in 1986, how did he turn out, why did this whole story get filmed Shown
 kirdaar asli he bas itnaa fark he
 What did Charles do to become? Director Prawal is the best director, he had already done more than half of the work, we did not read books, just read the news paper articles and footage and prepare
 uske chaal-dhaal or bolne kaa tarika hamane vahaan se siikhaa, asaliyat ke saath-saath thodaa kaalpanik bhi he
 What was the challenge? The character, the gait, the way, and the tone of the speech was very challenging
 mimicri nahin kii lekin us kirdaar tak pahunchane kii koshish kii
 You have spent a few years of your life in Australia too, got some help? Not much but when i was in Australia those days i got to know how to talk to girls
 film 1970-80 ke dashak se judi he
 When did you know about Charles? Sobhraj, Nagaraj i came to know these names at the age of 11
 uske naam se sab kaanpate the
 Amitabh Bachchan Saab has also taken great advantage of Charles' character in the movie 'don'
 wo mulkon kii police vaala dialaag charles kii nijee jindagi se liye hue hai
 Will the film lead to crime? i have just tried to play that character, and his journey through the film is shown
 vaise bhi hamaare desh main koi film dekh kar nahin badal jaataa, munnabhai dekhakar kitne log gandhi ho gaye? ramayana dekhakar koi ram bana? yah ek manoranjan he jise aaie dekhie or jaaie
 Do you attribute yourself to being famous? Naseer Saab (naseeruddin Shah) is a guru
 mere mata -pita, or mere jitne bhi kareebi log hai, sabakaa bahut bada haath he
 What do you see the good things of Charles? He meets any human being like him
 uskaa aakarshan kaa charm bhi bahut bada he
 i had heard that a tunnel from Charles' room led directly to the jailor's madame's room
 aapako safal hone main kya adchane aa rahi hai?meri khadi boli, meraa vyavhaar, meraa industry se naa hona, meri jeebh isakream chaatane ke liye istemaal karnaa ityadi
 Just now you came to meet Charles Sobhraj in Kathmandu jail, what was the experience like? It is not difficult to meet Charles, it is impossible, very tough
 charles ne jail main kaha he ki uski film 30 oktober ko relies ho rahi he, ham vahaan jailer saab se mili, request kii, phir unhone hamaare film ke posters le liye or kuch sain karke waapas bhi kiye
 Then got a chance to meet 10 minutes
 sabase pehle unhone bolaa- 'good quality product'
 Then he said - 'we tried a lot to stop the film, but you beat us because Amod Kant was also involved in it
 phir maine unase kaha kii -'maine aapse hi siikhaa he
 'he said that he has a hearing in the court on November 3 and he may be missed in 3 months
 unhone amod kaant ko shubhakamanaayen bhi bheji hai
 He is 72 years old but very handsome
 mujhe bura laga kii wo abhi jail main hai
 It is our endeavor not to become any more young 'charles'
 ab hajratganj se tajganj dur nahin
 Hazratganj means Lucknow and Tajganj means the city of Taj Mahal, Agra
 akhilesh yadav kii photo ke saath ye hording lakhanu se lekar unnav tak kai jagahon par lagi hai
 Akhilesh Yadav not only fulfilled his dream by landing a fighter jet on his built expressway at Bangarmau near Unnao on Sunday but also arranged to shut his opponents mouth
 unnav ke bangaramau main akhilesh yadav jab 23 maheene main taiyaar kii gai 302 kilometre kii express-ve kaa udghaatan karne pahunche
 So the entire family including Mulayam Singh was present there
 ramgopal yadav bhi aae the or jaya bachchan bhi ai thim
 On this occasion, an effort was made to show that the gap between the family is now erased and the Samajwadi Party's cycle will run on the expressway built by Akhilesh
 desh kii sabase badi ye express-ve 13200 crores rupee kii laagat se banaai gai
 The most important thing about this 302 km long, 6 lane expressway is that it was built in less than 2 years
 sabase badi baat yah he ki kisi bhipariyojnake liye bhoomi adhigrahan ek bahut chunauti bharaa kaam hota jo aksar vivaadon or adaalaton main funs jaataa he
 But the land for the expressway was acquired in such a peaceful manner that no one even got the ear-to-ear news
 express-ve agra se shuru hokar firozabad, mainpuri, itawa, auraiya, kannauj, hardoi, kanpur or unnav hote hue lakhanu tak pahonchegi
 a 3-km runway has been prepared on the expressway near Unnao where fighter ships can land if needed
 aam dinon main ye express sadak kii tarah kaam karegi lekin kisi jarurat ke samay 3 kilometre ke is sadak ke donon taraf se band karke vaayu sena ke liye air strip kii tarah istemaal kiya ja sakegaa
 Road was inaugurated at this place
 locarpan ke kaarykram main pehali baar ek ke baad ek chah miraj or sukhoi vimaan yahaan par utre
 This was the first time a Sukhoi aircraft was shown landing on a road
 haalanki sukhoi ke jameen par aane ke thik pehle sadak par ek kutta aa jane se afra-tafari much gai
 The expressway was in a hurry for fear of the implementation of the election code of conduct, but it has not been completed at all
 express ve par agar aap safar karen, to pataa chalata he ki raste main pul puliya banane se lekar tamaam kaam abhi bache hue hai or sadak ko puri tarah se shuru karne main abhi kai maheenon kaa samay lagegaa
 If people start walking on the half-finished road, then the risk of accident also increases significantly
 isi locarpan kaarykram ke taiyaariyon kaa jayja lene ke liye jab uttar pradesh ke varisht iees adhikarinavaneet sahagalkuch dinon pehle aa rahe the to unka car accident ho gaya or vah buree tarah ghayal hokar aspataal pahunch gaye
 Navneet Sehgal has played a big role in building the expressway
 durghatana main unke ghayal hone ke baad express-ve ke udghaatan ke dauraan hone vaale tamaam samskruti kaarykram ko radd kar diya gaya tha
 The UP government itself is agreeing that traffic cannot be allowed on this road for a month
 mayawati ne express-ve kaa locarpan ke baad kaha ki sirf dikhaane ke liye akhilesh yadav kii sarkaar aadhe adhure kaamon kaa bhi udghaatan kar rahi he
 There is also some truth in the allegation that Akhilesh Yadav is releasing his dream project before the election code of conduct comes into force, while most of the projects are still pending
 upi dial handred or gomti river front kaa bhi isi tarah se pichley hafte locarpan kiya gaya jabaki yah puraa nahin hua he
 Akhilesh Yadav also wants to inaugurate the Lucknow Metro as soon as possible
 lekin in sab ke baavjood express-ve taiyaar hone ke baad ek aisa shandaar kaam zarur hoga jis par samaajawaadee party ke log garv kar sakenge or chunaav main vot maangane ke liye akhilesh yadav ke paas ab ek acha mudda he

 com / fkqwye94a5— Office of RG (@officeofrg)october 29, 2017 Around the world, Taj Mahal is considered a symbol of love
 yah sabhi jaanate hai ki shahjahan ne apni begum mumtaj mahal kii yaad main ise banwaaya tha, lekin mumtaj mahal ko is mahal main kis tarah dafnaaya gaya yah aaj bhi ek rahasy he
 However, a new book claims to have uncovered this mystery
 kitaab main likhaa gaya he ki mumtaj ke shav ko mummy banaakar dafnaaya gaya tha or mumtaj ko dafnane ke liye shahjahan ne 17veen sadi main makbare ke rup main tajmahal kaa nirmaan karavaaya
 Afshar Ahmed, author of the controversial e-book 'taj Mahal or Mami Mahal', says, "the truth about the Taj Mahal has been hidden
" yadi tajmahal ke nirmaan ke samay hi sach kaa khulaasa ho jaataa to is nishaani kaa nirmaan puri tarah asambhav ho jaataa
 Ahmed, a journalist-turned-writer, has also revealed many unknown facts related to Mumtaz's death in his book
 kitaab main mumtaj kii maut or unki jindagi ke chand aakhri dinon ke bare main bhi byoraa diya gaya he
 The answers to many questions in the book, Ahmad says that Mumtaz was buried twice in an Amanat home twice before the last burial
 lekin us samay ke dauraan unke shav ko kis tarah sangrakshit rakhaa gaya? kya mughalon ne bhi usee tareeke ko amal main laayaa jise pracheen misr main laayaa jaataa tha yaa isamen koi or tarika apanaaya gaya? kya mughalon ke paas bhi shav ko sangrakshit rakhane kaa tarika tha? sabase bada sawaal ki kya mumtaj kaa shav abhi tak sangrakshit he? kitaab main in saare sawaalon kaa jawaab dene kii koshish kii gai he
 Ahmed said that he wanted to raise the curtain of mystery surrounding Mumtaz's death and his burial thereafter
 shahjahan ke darbari lekhak is puri ghatana par se pardaa uthaa sakate the, lekin ve aisa nahin kar sake kyonki unhen aisa kuch bhi khulaasa nahin karne kii hidaayat thi jisase badshaah kii chhavi kharaab hone kaa khatra ho
 The author said that readers have the right to know the truth behind Mumtaz's death and burial
 i-kitaab main yah bhi jaanane kaa prayaas kiya gaya he ki mughalon ne keval islamic rivaaj kaa paalan kiya yaa dafan ke liye duusare tareeke ko amal main laayaa

 Why does LK Advani, once a stalwart of BJP, now remain silent

 We may be born in any part of the country, from childhood till now some common stories have tied us together
 mizaaj ke mutabik ye kahaniyaan hamaare khalite main ai hai
 Story of Ramayana in childhood
 bhai se pyaar siikhnaa ho to ram-lakshmana kii preet
 If you want to learn bravery then you desire to become like Hanuman
 cricket kii baat karen to pichhali peedi sunil gavaskar ke kisse sun badi hui to hamaari peedi sachin tendulkar ke
 In this connection, there is a name that has been shared across generations, somewhat like the story of Ramayana
 yah naam he ramesh sippi kii saal 1975 main ai film ‘sholay’ kaa
 Every single character and dozens of dialogues of this film climbed our tongue without effort
 ham rosemara kii baatcheet main inkaa itani baar istemaal karte hai, goyaa ye dialog nahin hamaari bhashaa main sadiyon se chalan main bane muhaavarey hai
 So when the 3D version of this cinematic Shahkar is released in theaters, then you get caught in a kind of nostalgia
 ek film sameekshak ke taur par sholay kaa rivyuu karnaa to vaise hi kshamta ke pare he
 But even as a viewer, watching this film on the 70 mm screen gives a special feeling
 magar kuch khiz ke saath likhnaa pad rahaa he ki aaj relies hua film sholay kaa 3di varjan is maje ko kuch kharaab kar detaa he
 The effect of 3D is clearly visible in the film twice
 pehla, jab jai or viru inspector baldev singh ke saath malgadee main aate hai or train patari par dakaiton dwaara bichhaae lakdi ke latthon se takaraati he
 Some even reach the audience flying
 doosraa mauka tab aata he, jab inspector jai viru kii hadakadi kholane ke liye goli chalaate hai
 The bullet crosses the cinema hall, piercing iron
 lekin aise kuch drishyon ke alaava film par 3di takanic ek boj kii tarah pasri hui he
 i think it would have been better had the film been shown on the big screen with 2D technology
 ek or kaam ho saktaa tha auki vah yah ki iske edit kiye gaye drishyon ko asal film ke saath jod diya jaataa
 Or in the end the scenes would also be shown, which were later removed to change the story
 masalan, thakur baldev singh ke haathon gabbar kii maut kaa prasang
 Its video is a huge hit on youtube
 magar immergency ke daur main kanoon kii mahatta sthapit karne ke liye is seen ko hataa diya gaya tha
 The real scene was that Inspector Thakur, who arrived at the scene, reminds him of respect for the law and in retaliation, the trembling Thakur's leg stops before the last strike
 baharhaal, sab kahi-suni sab ek taraf
 It is magical to see Jai Veeru's friendship, Gabbar's awe, Thakur's wrath, Basanti's shokhi or Surma Bhopali's jokes
 ye daadi kii kahani se guzarane jaisaa he, jo kabhi puraani nahin padati
 What is your name Basanti, now what will happen to you Kalia, give this hand to me Thakur, Chhamkachhallo till your feet walk, its breath will last
 
 
 sanvaadon kaa ye silsilaa kahin rukta nahin
 Sholay is fantastic and if you can bypass the technical flaws of the 3D version, then it won't be a crime to fulfill the temptation to see on the big screen
 vaise hi hamaari peedi main bahut saare log aise hai, jinhone tivi par itminan se baithkar sholay nahin dekhi
 This can also prove to be a good opportunity for them

 With 228 sixes, ipl's Sixer King Chris Gayle is now rocking England
 wo summerset ke liye pehali baar khilne utre to unka andaaj itnaa visphotak tha ki unhone pehle hi match main shandaar shatak laga diya
 During this time, Chris Gayle hit 15 sixes and hit 151 off 62 balls without being dismissed till the end

 During this time, three occasions came when the ball fell out of the stadium into the nearby flowing river and disappeared
 haalanki is laajawab pari ke baavjood gail apni team summerset ko kent ke khilaaf jeet nahin dilaa sake
 Somerset coach Matthew Maynard, the aggressive batsman of his era, described Chris Gayle's innings as something like, "I thought Sam Northeast played a sensational innings but when this cricket boss landed on the pitch, he had a different style
" mere paas shabd nahin hai ki aaj maine kya dekha
 He made this big score very easy
 vah ball ko behad sateek anjaad main maidan se baahar pahunchaata ja rahaa tha
 Today, his innings were defeated by such a distance, beating such a big score today
 ’yah kris gail kii visphotak pari kaa najaara hi tha ki match ke antim ball se thik pehle vaali gend tak jeet summerset ke haathon main dikh rahi thi
 But this ball took the match out of Somerset's hands and placed it in Kent's hands as Gayle Dot played it
 haalanki unhone antim gend par bhi chakka jadaa lekin yah jeet ke liye kaaphi nahin tha or summerset kii team yah match teen ranon se haar gai
 After the match, Kent captain Northeast said, 'I don't know where to start
 yah laajawab match tha
 i have never seen a batting bat like Chris
 lekin main apane gendbaajon ko vishesh shrey dena chahta hum jo apane tay plan par tike rahe
 We also tried to bat the other batsmen more but whenever our bowlers did not bowl on the length that they would send it outside the park
 ’unhone kaha, ‘jab vipakshi team ko 15 ranon ke ausat se lakshya mila ho to aap sochenge ki match main ab kuch nahin bachaa he
 But when Chris is standing on the pitch and you have an average of 20 runs per over in front of you, then you know that it can be made

 After 'bajirao Mastani', famous film maker Sanjay Leela Bhansali is making the period film 'padmavati'
 mukhya bhoomika main ranvir singh, shahid kapur or deepika padukon hai
 He went to Jaipur in Rajasthan to shoot it
 vahaan par shuukravaar shaam rajput samaaj se jude ek sanghathan karani sena ne un par hamalaa kar diya
 He alleges that Bhansali is distorting historical facts for the film
 aise main ateet kaa ek kirdaar phir se surkhiyon kaa sabab ban gaya he or logon kii achaanak 'padmavati' ke kirdaar main dilchaspee paidaa ho gai he
 The question starts from here, who was Rani Padmavati after all? He is a historical character or a mere literary character
 ateet ke aaine main yadi jhaank kar dekha jaae to mana jaataa he ki 15-16veen sadi main yah kirdaar sabase pehle charchit hua
 Actually, Malik Muhammad Jaisi wrote the epic 'padmavat' around 1540 AD
 us kriti ke mutabik rani padmavati, chittod ke raja rawal ratan singh kii patni thim
 The comments us kahani main bataaya gaya he ki rani padmavati apratim saundarya kii malikaa thim
 The ruler of Delhi, Alauddin Khilji, was enamored of them
 padmavati ko paane ke liye usne 1303 main chittod par hamalaa kar diya or rajputon kii us yuddh main haar hui
 When Khilji reached the palace, he saw that Rajput women including Rani Padmavati had committed Jauhar
 johar madhyayug main ek aisi pratha thi jab rajput raajaaon ke yuddh main maare jane ke baad unki raniyaan dushman ke changul se bachane ke liye samuhik rup se aatmadah kar leti thim
 However, historians differ on its authenticity
 kai itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki padmavati naam kaa koi kirdaar itihaas main nahin tha
 According to him, Padmavati was only a literary character and was not a historical character
 ye itihaaskaar kehete hai ki allaudin ke jamaane main is tarah ke kisi kirdaar kaa zikr nahin miltaa
 They believe that this character has survived for centuries due to the Charan tradition, folk tales, reciting tradition and public opinion
 sawaal yaheen se shuru hota he ki aakhir rani padmavati koun thi? vah aitihaasik kirdaar hai yaa keval saahitiyik kirdaar hai
 If you look in the mirror of the past, then it is believed that this character was first discussed in the 15-16 century
 darasal malik mohammad jaaysi ne 1540 isvi ke aasapaas mahakavy 'padmavat' likhaa tha
 According to that work, Rani Padmavati was the wife of King Rawal Ratan Singh of Chittor
 tippaniyan It is told in that story that Rani Padmavati was the owner of unmatched beauty
 dilli kaa shaasha allaudin khilji un par aasakt tha
 He attacked Chittor in 1303 to get Padmavati and the Rajputs lost in that war
 khilji jab mahal pahunchaa to usne dekha ki rani padmavati samet rajput mahilaon ne johar kar liya tha
 Jauhar was a practice in the medieval era when the Rajput kings killed themselves en masse to escape the clutches of the enemy after they were killed in battle
 haalanki isaki pramanikta ko lekar itihaaskaaron main matbhed hai
 Many historians believe that there was no character named Padmavati in history
 unke mutabik padmavati keval ek saahitiyik kirdaar thi or vah aitihaasik kirdaar nahin thi
 These historians say that no such character is mentioned in the time of Alauddin
 ve maanate hai ki chaaran parampara, lok kathaon, vaachak parampara or janashruti ke chalate yah kirdaar sadiyon se jivit he

 pakistan adhikrut kashmir se loksabhaa main 5 siten or vidhansabha main 24 siten honi chahie, yah kahana he bijepi saansad nishikant dube kaa
 Nishikant Dubey is the MP who twice brought a private member bill and demanded 5 seats for the people of Pakistan occupied Kashmir in the Lok Sabha
 lekin us vakt unke bill ko riject kar diya gaya tha
 This demand has arisen again after the changed attitude of the Modi government regarding pok and the recent statement of the Prime Minister
 bijepi saansad nishikant dube ne 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki sarkaar is par vichaar karegi
 He said, 'modiji is serious about this issue and there will be no need to bring private member bill
 'dube ne aage kaha ki ab sarkaar is ore apana bill laaegi takipiokeke logon ko 5 siten loksabhaa main mil saken
 The MP also says that India will soon hoist the tricolor flag in Muzaffarabad as well
 sarkaar ko tay kerani hai ye chigenjammu-kashmir main 24 vidhansabha kii siten or loksabhaa main paanch siton ke bare main jitendra singh kaa kahana he ki rajya main yah praavdhaan he ki vahaan par 24 siten rakhi gai hai
 But there is no obstacle in this
 yah sab chijen sarkaar ko tay kerani hai
 There is a coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir and the main issue is development
 vahaan par loksabhaa main 5 siton ke bare main samuhik taur se nirnay lenaa hoga
 Psychologist Sudhir Kakkar announced five years ago that childbirth of sensual love has started coming to the courtyard of traditional Indian families
 ab lagata he, us tadap ko hawa dene vaali halchal hui he
 The results of the 2013 sex survey by India Today group-mdra show that the process of birth that Kakkar was talking about is still going on: we are in the phase of a cultural movement in which Indian couples love alcoholism The importance is increasing
 is tarah sex ke sahaj saanskrithik andolan ke bheetar hi ek or saanskrithik andolan jor pakad rahaa he
 Instead of traditional primary allegiance to duty and large families (these couples are part of), these couples are now gradually giving more importance to themselves
 is rujhaan ke jari rahane kii pushti karte hue 2013 ke aankade ek badlaav kii bhi baat karte haih pichley kuch varshon main bhartiya mahila kii arotic satta yaa kahen ki kaamuk nazariye main badlaav aayaa he
 This fact has the power to give birth to the agony of that yearning
 arotic ichchhaaon-kaamuk hone / dikhne kii kshamta or aatmavishvaas, yah jaananaa or kahana ki ‘‘meri bhi koi chahat he’’ or use aage badhkar puraa karnaa
 The expectations of society have kept this aspect under control
 abhi tak shaadi se pehle stri or purush ko alag rakhaa jaataa rahaa tha
 Another subtle way to curb these XXX desires is psychological: tying the wings of the erotic flight of women to the grooves of sexual purity
 ek adrishy-si manovaigyanik prakriya main gahare gunthi striyon kii arotic ichchhaaon par paabandiyaan ek puraani pranali par aadhaarit hai
 The system in which they are directly or indirectly supervised since childhood
 yah purana dastur he, jo peedi-dar-peedi chalaa aa rahaa he
 In the ancient treatise "manusmriti" of the Hindu Law Code, it is said, "women who protect themselves can only have better protection
" ’’striyon kii khud kii hi paharedaari main kai pahalu shaamil hai
 For example, do not let the desire for sex flourish in him and instill sexual innocence in them
 mahilaon main yah bahanapa hasil karne kii ek shart kii tarah rahaa he
 In the case of sex, other women of more verbose women squirm and exclude them from their purview
 aatm-niyantran kii yah ghutti maa-beti ke rishte ke jariye bachapan se hi pilaani shuru kar di jaati he
 After this, the rest of the family and the whole community supports it
 kisi stri kaa khulkar yon ichchhaaon kaa izhaar karnaa sharmnaak or ise balaatkaar ko nyotne kii tarah mana jaataa rahaa he
 This mixed system of respect and punishment proves to be very heavy in curbing the woman's power of XXX
 kisi bhi stri ke liye yah bada mushkil hota he ki vah bedroom main comarya or shuchita kii saanskrithik doot ke bhi rup main avatarit ho or santusht bhi ho
 Why? Because heavy restraint is needed to suppress the natural demands of the body; Women who get purity by cutting the web of such desires, get high status and recognition in India
 is tarah kii prishthbhumi main 2013 ke india today-emdiare survey ke striyon main yonik izhaar badaae jaise nishkarshon ko halake main nahin liya ja saktaa
 The Indian women express their sexual needs and demand satisfaction in the midst of cultural conditions that support the sexual innocence of long-standing women is indeed a counter culture
 bhartiya stri ke yon adhikaar kii vakaalat karne vaale is chote samooh kii shiddat se darkaar thi or ise aane main kaaphi samay laga he
 Writing about the enjoyment of women, in 2012, India Today writer Tishani Doshi used a metaphor for the group with poetic sense
 jamaa dene vaali thandi raat main ek-duusare ko garm rakhane ke liye ek saath pankh fadafadaatin minaaon kii fusfusaahat kii image ko taaja karte hue unhone likhaa tha, ‘‘kya’’ ham bhi apane ko bachaae rakhane ke liye samuhik rup se aisa nahin kar saktin or jab ham aisa karengi to akaash main kuch pankh to idhar-udhar udenge hi?’’ is kavita ke shabd yonik paharedaari ke khilaaf padate hai
 It is the aspiration of women who love and support each other in the tradition of sexual pleasure
 is saal ke aankadon main bhi isaki jhalak milti he
 In 2013 the direction of sexual guarding achievement is changing
 abhi tak mahila ke sharir ke anand ko akele main bhi abhivyakt kar paanaa sambhav nahin hota tha
 To explain the role of masturbation in sexual development, divide it into three elements - self-pleasure, sexual curiosity and sexual legitimacy
 teesraa tatv baaki donon par baari he
 The three elements act as a foundation for sexual ability
 mahilaon ke hastmaithun ke aankade abhi bhi purushon ke mukaable bahut kam hai, lekin ve arotic satta main badlaav ke suchak ke rup main mahatvapurn hai
 27 in the 2013 survey seeking pleasure
 6 fisadi mahilaayein un saanskrithik takaton ke saamne khadi hoti hai jo aatm-anveshan or aatm-anand ke prakritik swabhaav ko tarkahin maanate hai
 27
 6 kaa yah aankada anand or roodhiwaad ke lagaataar saath rahane kaa bhi aankada he
 27
 6 fisadi kii tulana hastmaithun se inkaar karne vaali 68 fisadi mahilaon se na karen, balki un mahilaon se karen, jinhone sawaal kaa jawaab dene se inkaar kiya he
 During the survey, many women resented this question and said that it was an attack on their "culture"
 ’’ sex ke bare main samvaad se inkaar kar khud ko utkrisht saanskrithik doot samajhane vaali ye mahilaayein is baat kaa pramaan hai ki aaj bhi bharat main avchetan rup main manusmriti ne jaden jamaai hui hai
 Men have also played an important role in this long way of clawing to support sexual legalism
 mard kya kar rahe hai, isaki ek hi misaal kaaphi hogiah shaadi ke alaava kisi afaire se yonik kshanon kaa anand lene kii pravriti ko is saal ke aankadon se chunauti mil rahi he
 In this, the figures of infidelity of men are given
 ek patni se hi rishte par ‘‘baat karne waalon’’ kii badi patibaddhta is baat kaa sanket ho sakati he ki bharat main kaamuk pyaar viksit ho rahaa he
 Likewise, the lack of boasting about men exploitation of their sexual desires is somewhat promising: perhaps there is a growing tendency for women to understand now rather than to perceive them as objects of pleasure
 striyon ke aankadon kii tarah purushon ke aankadon se bhi pataa chalata he ki aadhunik kaamuk pyaar or kaamuk pyaar ko pare rakhane ke puraane mulyon ke bich takaraav chal rahaa he
 The feudal shadow of women as property is still intact amidst the increased ability of Indian men to give importance to woman's sexuality
 bharat main kaamuk pyaar ke bhavishya kii ummid jagaane vaali tasviir is takaraav ke bagaiyr nahin ban sakthih yon roodhiwaad sadiyon se hi bharatiyon kii ek samuhik pahchaan bana hua he
 There hasn't been much change, but the 2013 survey certainly removes the possibility of an over-all prospect: a sensual future is visible, in our past, in a way that is melding the tone - or rejecting it
 yah ek aisi sambhaavna he jo band nimantran-patr kii tarah anjaani he lekin ummid jarur jagaati haih donon partneron ke liye arotic bhav, gender kii seemaabaddh bhoomikaaon se aage badaae kii jagah, stri kaa khud yaa samaaj kaa uski youniktaa ko khatre main na daalana, ek partner se yon sambandh banane main ruchi rakhane vaale purush
 The scale of sexual development is changing in our country

 Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vinod Yadav reserved his order till March 4 on the cbi's plea to end the case against 70-year-old Quattrocchi
 gauratlab he ki kwatrochi mukademe kaa saamana karne ke liye aaj tak bharat ke kisi bhi adaalat main pesh nahin hua
 In fact, the CBI had in October 2009 sought permission from the court to conclude the case against Quattrocchi
 sibiai ne iske liye yah daleel di thi ki usapar jari abhiyojan vibhinn kaarnon se anuchit he
 These reasons include the cbi's failure to get him extradited twice
 jaanch agency 2003 main use malaysia se pratyrpit karaane main tathaa 2007 main argentina se pratyrpit karaane main naakaam rahi he
 a charge sheet was filed against Quattrocchi for allegedly receiving brokerage in the Bofors cannon deal
 ram mandir-babari masjid kaa mudda ek baar phir se public main aa gaya he
 The same people have come among those who, after talking for 67 years, could not make a result even by fighting amongst themselves
 dhire-dhire yah mudda raajnneeti se nikalakar adaalat kii dehri main samaa gaya or aam taur par vyapak shanti kaayam ho gai
 The media made every effort to bring it public in every election of UP by asking the BJP when the temple would be built, but the BJP too started to execute its other strategies by talking about the court's decision
 baar-baar tamaam pakshon ne doharaaya ki adaalat kaa faisla antim rup se mana jayega
 There was a broad consensus on this one point in the context of the Ayodhya dispute, but a Supreme Court comment on Tuesday has brought all its parties back to TV
 vahi sawaal, vahi jawaab lekar tivi kii shaam saj gai he
 Now every day someone will say something or something and all the energy of the TV will be spent on this except the necessary work
 supreme court ke chif justise ne kaha ki behatar hoga ki donon paksh is mudde ko mil baithkar sulajhaayen
 This matter is related to religion and faith
 isliye donon paksh aapas main baithkar baatcheet ke zarie hal nikaalane kii koshish karen
 Supreme Court judges are also ready to mediate if required
 mukhya nyaayadhish ne yah bhi kaha ki agar donon paksh koi hal nahin nikaal pate hai to phir court is maamle kii sunwaayee kar faisla dene ke liye taiyaar rahegaa
 But all the people of both sides will sit at the table and talk, if it includes even fair people, it will be better
 supreme court ne is maamle main 31 march ko bataane ke liye kaha he ki kya faisla kiya gaya he
 On 26 February 2016, the Supreme Court considered BJP MP Subramanian Swamy as a party in all matters related to the Ayodhya dispute
 swami kaa kahana he ki chah saal se supreme court main maamla lambit he
 The Supreme Court should hear the daily and pronounce the verdict soon
 chif justise kii tippanee par pratikriya dete hue swami ne kaha ki donon samudaay is mudde par saath nahin baithenge, behatar he adaalat hi faisla de
 Ayodhya dispute is 125 years old
 is masale kii aag main donon samudaay ke na jane kitnon kii jaan chali gayi, kitnon kaa rojgaar chhina or kitnon ko netaa bana diya
 Neither a temple was built nor mosque breakers were caught
 supreme court kii avmaananaa karne vaale bhi batch gaye
 Why is the Supreme Court hearing for 6 years
 isliye ho rahi he ki elahabaad hoicourt kii teen jajon kii bench ne 30 sitambar 2010 ko ayodhya vivaad maamle main ek bada faisla diya
 Two of the three judges were unanimous and one voted separately
 ve the justise es you khan, justise sudhir agarwal or justise dharmaveer sharma
 When the verdict was about to come on 30 September 2010, there was silence all over the country and especially UP
 faisla bhi aayaa magar kuch nahin hua
 Perhaps by then the people of UP and the country had understood the issue of the game
 pichley saath saal main tamaam adaalatein, tamaam jaj is maamle kii sunwaayee karte rahe magar faisla likhane kii manzil par nahin pahunch sake
 After hearing 20-21 years in the Allahabad High Court, a decision was reached on one aspect related to this dispute for the first time
 teenon pakshon kaa hissaa maan liya gaya
 Now it was only to decide who would get which part, but all went to the Supreme Court against the first decision
 justise es you khan kii bench ne tay karte hue kaha ki muslim, hindu or nirmohi akhaada ko is vivaadit jameen kaa sanyukt hissedaar banaaya jaataa he
 The area of the middle dome where the idol is currently kept will be given to Hindus
 nirmohi akhaada ko wo hissaa diya jayega jo map main ram chabutara or sita rasoi ke naam se he
 a bench of two ratios one to three judges headed by Justice SU Khan raised the controversy to a point where the final verdict began to appear
 teen jajon ne is faisle ke liye 9000 se adhik panne likhe hai
 i would like to mention the lines that Justice SU Khan started his decision so that you can understand the challenges of a judge while writing this difficult decision
 other orginial suit number 4, 1989
 In the judgment of sunni central board of waqf up and others versus gopal singh visharad and others, what SU Khan starts with is a matter for law students, you can also understand that it is not easy to write a judgment in this matter
 Will be, but anyone can write if they want
 justise khan in panktiyon se shuruuaat karte hai - yahaan 1500 varg gaj jameen kaa ek tukdaa he jahaan devtaa bhi guzarane se darate hai
 It is filled with countless landmines, land mines
 hamen ise saaf karne kii jarurat he
 Some good people have advised us not to even try
 ham bhi nahin chaahate hai ki kisi murkh kii tarah jaldbaaji karen or khud ko uda len
 Despite this, we have to take risks
 kisi ne kaha he ki jivan main sabase bada jokhim hota he ki mauka aane par jokhim hi na liya jaae
 Once the gods were also forced to bow before humans
 ye ek aisa hi mauka he
 Have we succeeded or failed? There can be no judge in your case
 is tarah ye rahaa wo faisla jiskaa puraa desh saans roke intjaar kar rahaa he
 
 
 
 or justise khan faisla likh dete hai
 Had decided to give a decision
 faisle ke baad kisi ko intervyuu bhi nahin diya na media ke saamne aae
 The judge's work was done by him
 isi faisle main unhone ek or baat likhi he
 Which is closely related to the Supreme Court's comment
 10 baar baatcheet kii koshish hui he
 The attempt to negotiate with former Prime Minister Chanshekhar is considered to be the closest to success, but ultimately all failed
 baatcheet ke naam jitani koshish nahin hoti usase kahin adhik maahaul ko garmaya jaataa he
 a bench of Justice SU Khan also gave a chance to negotiate
 27 july 2010 ko ek aadesh bhi paas hua tha jisamen kaha gaya tha ki aaj hamane baatcheet ke zarie vivaad ko sulajhane kii sambhaavnaaon par bhi vichaar kiya
 Nothing concrete has come out yet
 phir bhi hamane sabhi vidwaan vakeelon se kaha he ki jab tak faisla sunaaya ja rahaa he tab tak unhen chhot he ki ve baatcheet ke zarie samjhaute kaa prayaas karen or zarurat padane par oesady se bench gathit karne ke liye sampark kar sakate hai
 July to September arrived but there was no attempt to negotiate
 30 sitambar 2010 ko elahabaad hoicourt ne faisla hi suna diya
 That decision was also well reviewed
 jisamen kaha gaya tha ki hinduon kii aasthaa main hastkshep nahin honi chahie
 In the comments, the Supreme Court is talking about giving another opportunity for dialogue by taking the name of religion and faith
 lihaaza baatcheet raajnneetik ho chali he
 Why does not the Supreme Court, like the Allahabad High Court, hear the daily and take forward the decision of the High Court
 kya sabhi ko sarvocch nyaayalay kaa intjaar nahin karnaa chahie
 The comments kya hamaari adaalatein aasthaa ke naam par yaa logon ke bich vyapak pratikriya ko lekar ashankit rahati hai
 Their concern is what will happen after the verdict
 kya aisa hona chintaa kii baat nahin he
 In November 2015, when a petition came before the Bombay High Court regarding the entry of women into Haji Ali, Justice VM Kanade said that this is the time of intolerance
 dharmik maamalon main log aksar samvedansheel ho jate hai, isliye ham aam taur par koshish karte hai ki dakhal hi na den
 In this case also, the court had requested all the parties to resolve it through mutual negotiation
 aisa nahin he ki adaalaton ne janabhaavana ke khilaaf jaakar faisle nahin die hai magar jo masalaa 67 saal main adaalat kii antim dehri par pahunchaa he, vahaan se baatcheet kii asafal mez par kyon bheja rahaa he

 Especially when everyone is sitting to accept the court order, they are ready
 sava sau saal purana he ayodhya vivaad
 In the fire of this issue, many of the communities lost their lives, some lost their jobs and some were made leaders
 na mandir bana na masjid todane vaale pakade gaye
 Those who contempt the Supreme Court also survived
 supreme court main 6 saal se sunwaayee kyon ho rahi he
 This is why the three-judge bench of Allahabad High Court gave a major verdict in the Ayodhya dispute case on 30 September 2010
 teen main do jaj ekamat the or ek ne alag mat diya tha
 They were Justice SU Khan, Justice Sudhir Aggarwal and Justice Dharamvir Sharma
 30 sitambar 2010 ko jab faisla aane vaala tha tab puure desh or khaskar upi main sannata chaa gaya tha
 The decision also came but nothing happened
 shaayad tab tak upi or desh kii janata is mudde kaa khel samaj gai thi
 In the last sixty years, all the courts, all the judges kept hearing this matter but could not reach the floor of writing the judgment
 elahabaad hoicourt main 20-21 saal sunwaayee ke baad pehali baar is vivaad se jude ek pahalu par faisla aa gaya
 All three sides were accepted
 ab sirf yah tay karnaa tha ki koun sa hissaa kise milegaa, magar sabhi pehle faisle ke khilaaf supreme court chale gaye
 a bench of Justice SU Khan held that Muslim, Hindu and Nirmohi Akhada are made joint share holders of the disputed land
 bich vaale gumbad kaa kshetra jahaan philhal murti rakhi hui he, wo hinduon ko diya jayega
 Nirmohi Arena will be given the part which is named as Ram Chabutara and Sita Rasoi in the map
 justise es you khan kii adhyakshata main do anupaat ek se teen jajon kii bench ne is vivaad ko aise mukaam par pahunchaa diya jahaan se antim faisla kareeb dikhne laga
 Three judges have written more than 9000 pages for this decision
 justise es you khan ne apane faisle kii shuruyaat jin panktiyon se kii he uskaa zikr karnaa chahta hum taaki aap is mushkil faisle ko likhte samay ek jaj kii chunautiyon ko samaj saken
 other orginial suit number 4, 1989
 sunni central board of waqf up and others versus gopal singh visharad and others ke faisle main es you khan jis baat se shuru karte hai wo kanoon ke chaatro ke liye nazir to he hi, aap bhi samaj sakate hai ki is maamle main faisla likhnaa aasaan nahin hoga, magar koi chaahe to likh saktaa he
 Justice Khan starts with these lines - here 1500 square yards is a piece of land where even the gods are afraid to pass
 yah anginat barudi surangon, land mins se bharaa hua he
 We need to clean it up
 kuch bhale logon ne hamen salaah di he ki koshish bhi mat karo
 We also do not want to hurry up like a fool and blow ourselves up
 baavjood iske hamen jokhim to lenaa hi he
 Somebody has said that the biggest risk in life is that risk should not be taken at the chance
 ek baar devataaon ko bhi insaanon ke aage jhukne ke liye majaboor kiya gaya tha
 This is one such opportunity
 ham safal hue hai yaa naakaam rah gaye hai? apane cese main koi jaj nahin ho saktaa he
 In this way, this is the decision whose entire nation is waiting for breath
 
 
 
 And Justice Khan writes the verdict
 tay kar liya tha ki faisla dena he
 After the verdict, no one was interviewed or appeared in the media
 jaj kaa jo kaam hota he wo karke ja chuke the
 In this decision, he has written one more thing
 jiskaa supreme court kii tippanee se gaharaa taalluk he
 Talks have been attempted 10 times
 purv pradhanmantri chanshekhar ke saath baatcheet kii koshish ko safalataa ke sabase kareeb mana jaataa he magar antim taur par sab naakaam rahi
 The atmosphere of the conversation is not much more than what is called
 justise es you khan kii bench ne bhi baatcheet kaa ek mauka diya tha
 On July 27, 2010, an order was also passed stating that today we have also considered the possibilities of resolving the dispute through dialogue
 abhi tak kuch bhi thos nahin niklaa he
 Nevertheless, we have told all learned lawyers that as long as the verdict is being delivered, they are exempted to try to negotiate through negotiations and, if necessary, contact OSD to set up the bench
 july se sitambar aa gaya magar baatcheet kaa koi prayaas nahin hua
 On 30 September 2010, the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict
 us faisle kii bhi khub samiksha hui
 Which said that there should be no interference in the faith of Hindus
 supreme court tippanee main dharm or aasthaa kaa naam lekar baatcheet kaa ek or mauka dene kii baat kar rahaa he
 So the conversation has become political
 ucchtam adaalat kyon nahin elahabaad hoicourt kii tarah rojaanaa sunwaayee kar ucch adaalat ke faisle ko aage badhaati he
 Should not everyone wait for the Supreme Court
 tippaniyan Do our courts remain apprehensive in the name of faith or a widespread response among the people
 unki chintaa main yah hota he ki faisle ke baad kya hoga
 Is it not a matter of concern? november 2015 main jab haazi ali main auraton ke pravesh ko lekar bambe hoicourt ke saamne yachika ai to justise viem kanaade ne kaha ki ye jo samay he wo ashishnutaa kaa samay he
 People often become sensitive in religious matters, so we usually try not to interfere
 is maamle main bhi adaalat ne sabhi pakshon se guzarish kii thi ki aapasi baatcheet se sulajhaa len
 It is not that the courts have not given the verdict against public sentiment, but the issue which has reached the last court of the court in 67 years, why is it sending on the failed table of negotiation from there
 khaskar tab jab sab adaalat ke aadesh ko sweekaar karne ke liye baithe hai, raji hai
 When the verdict was about to come on 30 September 2010, there was silence all over the country and especially UP
 faisla bhi aayaa magar kuch nahin hua
 Perhaps by then the people of UP and the country had understood the issue of the game
 pichley saath saal main tamaam adaalatein, tamaam jaj is maamle kii sunwaayee karte rahe magar faisla likhane kii manzil par nahin pahunch sake
 After hearing 20-21 years in the Allahabad High Court, a decision was reached on one aspect related to this dispute for the first time
 teenon pakshon kaa hissaa maan liya gaya
 Now it was only to decide who would get which part, but all went to the Supreme Court against the first decision
 justise es you khan kii bench ne tay karte hue kaha ki muslim, hindu or nirmohi akhaada ko is vivaadit jameen kaa sanyukt hissedaar banaaya jaataa he
 The area of the middle dome where the idol is currently kept will be given to Hindus
 nirmohi akhaada ko wo hissaa diya jayega jo map main ram chabutara or sita rasoi ke naam se he
 a bench of two ratios one to three judges headed by Justice SU Khan raised the controversy to a point where the final verdict began to appear
 teen jajon ne is faisle ke liye 9000 se adhik panne likhe hai
 i would like to mention the lines that Justice SU Khan started his decision so that you can understand the challenges of a judge while writing this difficult decision
 other orginial suit number 4, 1989
 In the judgment of sunni central board of waqf up and others versus gopal singh visharad and others, what SU Khan starts with is a matter for law students, you can also understand that it is not easy to write a judgment in this matter
 Will be, but anyone can write if they want
 justise khan in panktiyon se shuruuaat karte hai - yahaan 1500 varg gaj jameen kaa ek tukdaa he jahaan devtaa bhi guzarane se darate hai
 It is filled with countless landmines, land mines
 hamen ise saaf karne kii jarurat he
 Some good people have advised us not to even try
 ham bhi nahin chaahate hai ki kisi murkh kii tarah jaldbaaji karen or khud ko uda len
 Despite this, we have to take risks
 kisi ne kaha he ki jivan main sabase bada jokhim hota he ki mauka aane par jokhim hi na liya jaae
 Once the gods were also forced to bow before humans
 ye ek aisa hi mauka he
 Have we succeeded or failed? There can be no judge in your case
 is tarah ye rahaa wo faisla jiskaa puraa desh saans roke intjaar kar rahaa he
 
 
 
 or justise khan faisla likh dete hai
 Had decided to give a decision
 faisle ke baad kisi ko intervyuu bhi nahin diya na media ke saamne aae
 The judge's work was done by him
 isi faisle main unhone ek or baat likhi he
 Which is closely related to the Supreme Court's comment
 10 baar baatcheet kii koshish hui he
 The attempt to negotiate with former Prime Minister Chanshekhar is considered to be the closest to success, but ultimately all failed
 baatcheet ke naam jitani koshish nahin hoti usase kahin adhik maahaul ko garmaya jaataa he
 a bench of Justice SU Khan also gave a chance to negotiate
 27 july 2010 ko ek aadesh bhi paas hua tha jisamen kaha gaya tha ki aaj hamane baatcheet ke zarie vivaad ko sulajhane kii sambhaavnaaon par bhi vichaar kiya
 Nothing concrete has come out yet
 phir bhi hamane sabhi vidwaan vakeelon se kaha he ki jab tak faisla sunaaya ja rahaa he tab tak unhen chhot he ki ve baatcheet ke zarie samjhaute kaa prayaas karen or zarurat padane par oesady se bench gathit karne ke liye sampark kar sakate hai
 July to September arrived but there was no attempt to negotiate
 30 sitambar 2010 ko elahabaad hoicourt ne faisla hi suna diya
 That decision was also well reviewed
 jisamen kaha gaya tha ki hinduon kii aasthaa main hastkshep nahin honi chahie
 In the comments, the Supreme Court is talking about giving another opportunity for dialogue by taking the name of religion and faith
 lihaaza baatcheet raajnneetik ho chali he
 Why does not the Supreme Court, like the Allahabad High Court, hear the daily and take forward the decision of the High Court
 kya sabhi ko sarvocch nyaayalay kaa intjaar nahin karnaa chahie
 The comments kya hamaari adaalatein aasthaa ke naam par yaa logon ke bich vyapak pratikriya ko lekar ashankit rahati hai
 Their concern is what will happen after the verdict
 kya aisa hona chintaa kii baat nahin he
 In November 2015, when a petition came before the Bombay High Court regarding the entry of women into Haji Ali, Justice VM Kanade said that this is the time of intolerance
 dharmik maamalon main log aksar samvedansheel ho jate hai, isliye ham aam taur par koshish karte hai ki dakhal hi na den
 In this case also, the court had requested all the parties to resolve it through mutual negotiation
 aisa nahin he ki adaalaton ne janabhaavana ke khilaaf jaakar faisle nahin die hai magar jo masalaa 67 saal main adaalat kii antim dehri par pahunchaa he, vahaan se baatcheet kii asafal mez par kyon bheja rahaa he
 Especially when everyone is sitting to accept the court order, they are ready
 justise es you khan kii bench ne tay karte hue kaha ki muslim, hindu or nirmohi akhaada ko is vivaadit jameen kaa sanyukt hissedaar banaaya jaataa he
 The area of the middle dome where the idol is currently kept will be given to Hindus
 nirmohi akhaada ko wo hissaa diya jayega jo map main ram chabutara or sita rasoi ke naam se he
 a bench of two ratios one to three judges headed by Justice SU Khan raised the controversy to a point where the final verdict began to appear
 teen jajon ne is faisle ke liye 9000 se adhik panne likhe hai
 i would like to justise es you khan ne apane faisle kii shuruyaat jin panktiyon se kii he uskaa zikr karnaa chahta hum taaki aap is mushkil faisle ko likhte samay ek jaj kii chunautiyon ko samaj saken
 other orginial suit number 4, 1989
 sunni central board of waqf up and others versus gopal singh visharad and others ke faisle main es you khan jis baat se shuru karte hai wo kanoon ke chaatro ke liye nazir to he hi, aap bhi samaj sakate hai ki is maamle main faisla likhnaa aasaan nahin hoga, magar koi chaahe to likh saktaa he
 Justice Khan starts with these lines - here 1500 square yards is a piece of land where even the gods are afraid to pass
 yah anginat barudi surangon, land mins se bharaa hua he
 We need to clean it up
 kuch bhale logon ne hamen salaah di he ki koshish bhi mat karo
 We also do not want to hurry up like a fool and blow ourselves up
 baavjood iske hamen jokhim to lenaa hi he
 Somebody has said that the biggest risk in life is that risk should not be taken at the chance
 ek baar devataaon ko bhi insaanon ke aage jhukne ke liye majaboor kiya gaya tha
 This is one such opportunity
 ham safal hue hai yaa naakaam rah gaye hai? apane cese main koi jaj nahin ho saktaa he
 In this way, this is the decision whose entire nation is waiting for breath
 
 
 
 And Justice Khan writes the verdict
 tay kar liya tha ki faisla dena he
 After the verdict, no one was interviewed or appeared in the media
 jaj kaa jo kaam hota he wo karke ja chuke the
 In this decision, he has written one more thing
 jiskaa supreme court kii tippanee se gaharaa taalluk he
 Talks have been attempted 10 times
 purv pradhanmantri chanshekhar ke saath baatcheet kii koshish ko safalataa ke sabase kareeb mana jaataa he magar antim taur par sab naakaam rahi
 The atmosphere of the conversation is not much more than what is called
 justise es you khan kii bench ne bhi baatcheet kaa ek mauka diya tha
 On July 27, 2010, an order was also passed stating that today we have also considered the possibilities of resolving the dispute through dialogue
 abhi tak kuch bhi thos nahin niklaa he
 Nevertheless, we have told all learned lawyers that as long as the verdict is being delivered, they are exempted to try to negotiate through negotiations and, if necessary, contact OSD to set up the bench
 july se sitambar aa gaya magar baatcheet kaa koi prayaas nahin hua
 On 30 September 2010, the Allahabad High Court gave its verdict
 us faisle kii bhi khub samiksha hui
 Which said that there should be no interference in the faith of Hindus
 supreme court tippanee main dharm or aasthaa kaa naam lekar baatcheet kaa ek or mauka dene kii baat kar rahaa he
 So the conversation has become political
 ucchtam adaalat kyon nahin elahabaad hoicourt kii tarah rojaanaa sunwaayee kar ucch adaalat ke faisle ko aage badhaati he
 Should not everyone wait for the Supreme Court
 tippaniyan Do our courts remain apprehensive in the name of faith or a widespread response among the people
 unki chintaa main yah hota he ki faisle ke baad kya hoga
 Is it not a matter of concern? november 2015 main jab haazi ali main auraton ke pravesh ko lekar bambe hoicourt ke saamne yachika ai to justise viem kanaade ne kaha ki ye jo samay he wo ashishnutaa kaa samay he
 People often become sensitive in religious matters, so we usually try not to interfere
 is maamle main bhi adaalat ne sabhi pakshon se guzarish kii thi ki aapasi baatcheet se sulajhaa len
 It is not that the courts have not given the verdict against public sentiment, but the issue which has reached the last court of the court in 67 years, why is it sending on the failed table of negotiation from there
 khaskar tab jab sab adaalat ke aadesh ko sweekaar karne ke liye baithe hai, raji hai

 You must have heard the famous jingle 'OLX do it, go ahead'
 zyaadaatar log zarurat kaa saamaan kharidne yaa apana purana saamaan bechney ke liye OLX karte hai
 So there are some people who use this portal to cheat people
 thagon kaa ye giroh dusron ko fansaane ke liye alag-alag tareeke istemaal karata he
 One such gang has been detected who is tarnishing the name of institutions like Indian Army and CISF to cheat others
 farjeevre ke liye is aadhaar card kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 The card belongs to CISF Jawan Srikanth posted at Mumbai Airport
 darasal ye giroh logon ko saste main aiphone or duusare mahange smartphone ofar karata he
 For this, the names of CISF and some soldiers of the Indian Army, their ID cards, Aadhaar cards and their photographs in uniform are used
 phone kareedne kii ichha jataane vaale se kaha jaataa he ki wo indian army yaa siaiesaf kaa jawan he or duty par desh ke kisi dur-daraaj ke ilaake main tainaat he
 He is in dire need of money, which is why he is selling his phone so cheaply
 sasta maal kareedne ke chakkar main log us thag ko paise petm kar dete hai or phir unke haath kuch nahin lagata he
 a person who has fallen victim to this swindle aajtak
 in se sampark kiya
 He recently sent money to this thug around fifteen thousand
 jab hamane shikaar ho chuke vyakti se poocha ki usne itane paise bhej kaise die to usne kaha, ‘usne hamase phone par kai baar baat kii
 He also uploaded photos of the product and the biggest thing he said is that he is associated with the army
 usne hamen apana idi card, aadhaar card or vardi main apni tasviir bhi bheji to ye sab dekhakar laga ki army kaa jawan jhooth to bolegaa nahin, so hamane vishwaas kar liya
 'in this message you are seeing how people are sending money to these thugs of the army
 jab hamane is bare main padtaal kii to pataa chalaa ki aisi thagi kai logon ke saath ho chuki he
 Shadab Usmani was also a victim of this thug last week
 wo internet par likhte hai, ‘mere bhai, mere saath bhi yah frod hua he
 i had fifteen thousand five hundred
 ’is thagi kaa shikaar hue logon main se kuch ne is bare main video bhi banaaya he jisamen us thag se phone par hui baatcheet suni ja sakati he
 Now the question arises that who is the CISF jawan whose name, ID card and Aadhaar card are being used in this fraud? Is he really a CISF jawan or not? On the basis of this ID card, we talked to the cisf's media in-charge, Deputy Commandant Hemendra Singh, about this forgery
 baqul hemendra CISF ko puure maamle kii jaankaree tab hui jab logon ne twitor par unhen tag karnaa shuru kiya
 He says, 'four months before today, we came to know about this case
 hamane pataa karavaaya to maaloom hua ki is naam kaa ek jawan hamaare vibhaag main he or filhal mumbai airport par tainaat he
 He got his ID card and Aadhar card from somewhere, which these people are using
 hamaare jawan ne mumbai police main shikaayat bhi kii he
 'hemendra Singh adds,' The department also wrote to OLX about this and they also gave satisfactory answers
 ham apane soshal media acount se bhi is bare main logon ko aagaah karte rahete hai
 'this screenshot shows that Fergivara is still happening
 bhale hi OLX ne CISF kii shikaayat par karrwai kii lekin thagi kaa yah silsilaa tham nahin rahaa he
 Some people have been victims of this till two weeks ago
 hamane is bare main OLX india se bhi sampark kiya lekin khabar likhe jane tak unki taraf se hamen koi jawaab nahin mila
 It is also being fraudulent using the departmental canteen card and Aadhaar card of a soldier of the Indian Army
 is jawan ne khud ek video banaakar is bare main bataaya ki kuch log uske naam, vibhageeya card or aadhaar card kaa istemaal karke farjivada kar rahe hai
 This video has been uploaded to youtube on 6 May
 video main kaha ja rahaa he, 'helo dosto
 
 
 My name is Suresh
 main aapako ek jaankaree dena chahta hum ki mere naam se OLX main dupliket aid diya ja rahaa he
 i would like to tell that they have stolen my document and are misusing it
 khaskar meraa aadhaar card, dephence kaa cantin card
 
 
 'indian Army Jawan Suresh has made a video and told that some people are using his I-card wrongly
 2 minute 35 second lambey is video main suresh logon ko bataa rahaa he ki usne is bare main sibar cell main shikaayat darj karvaa rakhi he or kisi ko is tarah ke kisi bhi aid par bharosa karke apane paise dene kii jarurat nahin he
