 ambani kii madadgaar modi sarkaarcongressi netaa ne hindu aatankwaad ko lekar sawaal khadey kiye
 He said that such issues are being raised to divert public attention from basic issues like jobs, farmer crisis, bank loans
 bijepi kii sarkaar main bank ke lone kaa sankat badha he
 This government is only helpful to Dhanna Seths, Modi government is only helpful to Ambani
 congressi netaa navjot singh siddhu ne kaha ki narendra modi apane jhooth kii lahar main dub jaaenge
 He made 342 resolutions last time, of which not a single one was fulfilled
 unka har vaada adhuraa or jhootha tha
 i speak against Modi because future generations should say that Sidhu was not watching the spectacle when the country was being ruined
 unhone kaha ki aapane paanch saal kya kiya, 32 lakh karod kaa karj chadha diya
 Modi did not fulfill even a promise Sidhu said that Modi had talked about cleaning the Ganga, he had talked of bringing 15 lakhs
 videshon se 90 lakh karod laaungaa kaha tha, lekin sab jhooth niklaa
 It is said in the Indian culture that Raghukul rituals have always come, let go of life, but the promise has not gone
 lekin modi ne apana ek bhi vachan puraa nahin kiya
 They have put wealth in the pockets of private capitalists and the rich by killing the rights of all government companies
 modi kii sarkaar aane se pehle bade puunjipatiyon 49 fisadi daulat thi, inaki sarkaar aane ke baad ye amir 74 fisadi daulat ke maalik ban gaye
 90 percent of the country's farmers have 24-25 percent wealth
 donon ke bich main kitna antar aa gaya he
 i did not see a bigger throw than PM
 On the promises of Modi, Sidhu said that Zaheer Khan used to throw the ball at a speed of 120-130 kmph with the left hand, Modi throws it even faster
 saath hi kaha ki maine isse bada phenku pradhanmantri ajtak nahin dekha
 During his tenure, the npas of public banks increased from 2 lakh crores to 22 lakh crores, four lakh crores rupees, so he directly waived the rich
 ye kah rahe hai- phir ek baar jabaki aam aadmi kah rahaa he- bas kar yaar
 Neither Ram got nor got employment, unemployed with mobile in every street, Milasidhu said that Narendra Modi had said that he will give 2 crore jobs every year, demonetisation lost job of crores of people
 inhone ambani ko itane bade theke de die, ye amir log kahaan se menuphaccharing karaate hai, china se karaate hai
 Sidhu said that in Modi's government - neither Ram was found, no employment was found, every mobile, running a mobile in every street, got unemployed
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki sarkari company beasenel ko ajtak 4ji kaa theka nahin diya, privet companiyon ko de diya
 By not giving to the state-owned NTPC, he gave power contracts to Adani abroad
 siddhu ne kaha ki modi bas do yojanaon ke liye jane jaaenge- naujavaanon ke liye pakora yojana, amiron ke liye bhagauda yojana
 Now PM himself is running from issues
 piem modi kyon lade the do siton se chunaav?rahul gandhi ko lekar siddhu ne kaha ki meraa sapana he ki main apane leader ko oonchai par dekhuun
 When Rahul Gandhi contested Amethi and Wayanad two seats, he said why did Modi contest from two seats? He said that Rahul Gandhi is constantly challenging PM Modi for debate, but Modi is also running away from it
 priyanka gandhi ke liye siddhu ne kaha ki vah sherni se bhi bahadur hai, phulon kii sej par nahin rahi hai
 He has been given the job of organization
 unako jad seenchne kaa kaam diya he, isliye vah chunaav nahin lard rahi hai
 The army is for fighting, not for fighting Modi's election
 Sidhu further said that today the army of India has become the army of Modi, the army of India is for fighting the battle, not for fighting Modi's election
 unhone aage kaha ki modi hi kehete the ki das rupee kaa pen lo to pakkaa bill lo, aaj ham rafel kaa bill maangate hai to vah kyon itnaa bilabila rahe hai
 He said for PM Modi - he had come as Ganga's red, will go as Rafale broker
 aaj chaukeedaar bolkar dekho, log kya kehete hansiddhu ne modi lahar par kaha ki pehle modi-modi kii aawaaj hoti thi, aaj bas aap ek baar chaukeedaar bol lo, dekh lo logon ke bich se kisi aawaaj aati he
 On the question of who in front of Modi, Sidhu said that i am in front of Modi, Rahul is in front of Modi, a common man is in front of Modi, a young man is in front of Modi
 modi to ek jawan tejbahadur yadav se dar gaye, uske kaagaj bhi cancil karvaa die
 What are you worried about
 unhone aage kaha ki modi aayaa news khatm, kisaan khatm, chota vyapaaree khatm, bada vyapaar khatm or desh bhi khatm
 Modi is not a Tanti Tope, whoever will be afraid of them, when all the parties come together for fear of Modi, Sidhu said which Tanti Tope is Modi, people will be afraid of him
 modi khud saare muddon se darkar bhaag rahe hai
 They are not able to mention their own promises again
 kaabiliyat kaa akalan kaise hota he, aapane apane vaadon ko kitna puraa kiya
 Let me tell you that Navjot Singh Sidhu has been an attacker for Prime Minister Modi since he joined the Congress
 unhen pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf die gaye bayaan par kaaran bataao notice jari kiya he
 The Election Commission has issued a notice to Sidhu on the basis of a complaint by Neeraj, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker in Gujarat
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki siddhu ne 17 april ko ahmedabad main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri ko 'chor' kaha tha

 In order to increase the age of a cow, a big hole is made in its body
 darasal, lambey samay tak wetenry shodh ke baad sabit ho chukaa he ki gaay ke sharir main bada chhed kar dene se use nuksaan hone ke bajaay phayda hi hota he
 People associated with the dairy industry say that this has also led to a significant reduction in cases of untimely deaths from cows disease
 aapane kai baar soshal media par gaayon ke sharir main chhed vaali tasviir or video dekhi hongi
 Today we are telling you the story behind it
 gaay ke sharir main bada chhed dekhakar thodaa ajeeb lagata he, lekin iske peeche wetenry se jude shodhakartaaon kaa apana tark he
 He says that by making a big hole in the cow's body, the diseases inside his body can be easily inspected
 is bade chhed ke jariye ye bhi jaanane main suvidha hoti he ki gaay ke pet main khaanaa achche se pach rahaa he yaa nahin
 From this, bacteria in the stomach of the cow can also be easily detected
 pipal for ithical treetment of animals (peta) kii website ke mutabik gaay ke sharir main banaaya jane vaala yah bada chhed fistula (fistula) kaha jaataa he
 At the same time, the part of the body in which this big hole is made is called Rumen
 tippaniyan It is said that when surgery is done to pierce the cow's body, the cow is uncomfortable for about six weeks
 haalanki kushal doctoron ke is surgery karne par gaay ko kisi bhi tarah ke nuksaan hone kii koi sambhaavna nahin hoti he
 After making a big hole in the cow's body, it is closed with a plastic ring
 saath hi ichha ke anusaar dhakkan hataakar gaay ke pet main jhaanka ja saktaa he
 Many times, when a cow is sick, medicine is put directly in her stomach
 gaay ke pet main kisi tareeke kii gadabadi kii sthiti main wetenry doctor haath daalkar gaay ke pet ko khud hi saaf kar lete hai
 Many organizations also oppose this process of piercing the stomach of a cow
 virodh karne waalon kaa kahana he ki kya ham keval apane phaayde ke liye pashuon ke saath is tarah kaa prayog karnaa jaij he
 Critics also say that the Federal Animal Welfare Act, which exists in the US, is the only law that can prevent the use of animals for their own benefit
 saath hi pashuon ko uskaa adhikaar mil saktaa he
 However, this law does not apply to cows used in farming
 olchak ise gaayon ke saath krurta maanate hai or ise rokane ke liye kanoon kii maang karte hai
 According to the website of People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), this large hole made in the cow's body is called fistula
 vahiin sharir ke jis hisse main yah bada chhed banaaya jaataa he use rumen (rumen) kehete hai
 The comments bataaya jaataa he ki jab gaay ke sharir main chhed karne ke liye surgery kii jaati he to kareeb chah hafte tak gaay asahaj hoti he
 However, there is no possibility of any harm to the cow if skilled doctors perform this surgery
 gaay ke sharir main bada chhed karne ke baad use ek plastic kii ring se band kar diya jaataa he
 Also, the lid can be peeled into the stomach of the cow as per the desire
 kai baar gaay ke biimaar hone par uske pet main sidhe dawaai daal di jaati he
 In case of any kind of disturbance in the stomach of the cow, the veterinary doctors put their hands and clean the stomach of the cow itself
 gaay ke pet main chhed karne kii is prakriya kaa kai sanghathan virodh bhi karte hai
 Those who oppose it, are we justified in using this kind of animals only for our benefit
 aalochakon kaa ye bhi kahana he ki america main maujuud fedral animal welfare act hi ekmaatr aisa kanoon he, jo apane phaayde ke liye pashuon ke saath kiye jane vaale prayog ko roak saktaa he
 Also animals can get their rights
 haalanki kheti-baadi ke kaam main upyog hone vaale gaay par yah kanoon lagu nahin hota he
 Olchak considers this to be cruelty to cows and calls for legislation to stop it

 If a member of the Raj family is associated with the Congress party, then the Chief Minister of Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje, feels sad
 vasundhara raaje namakan ke aakhri din se ek din pehle raat kota ke purv rajpariwaar kobijepimen shaamil karne main kaamyaab raheen
 Significantly, Kivsundhara Rajekhud is from Dholpur royal family
 kota kaa rajpariwaar lambey samay se congress se judaa rahaa he or kota ke purv maharaj ijyaraj singh congress ke saansad bhi rahe hai
 His father has also been a cabinet minister at the Center on behalf of the Congress Party, but Vasundhara Raje has fielded his wife Kalpana Singh against the Congress by giving him a BJP ticket from Ladpura Assembly
 apni kamyaabi kaa jashn manaane ke liye vasundhara raaje aaj khud kota raaj parivaar ke nivas city pales pahunchi or vahaan tilak lagaakar ijyaraj singh or unki patni kalpana singh ko bijepi kii sadsyta dilwaai
 Kota MP Om Birla was also present on the occasion
 is maukey par vasundhara raaje ne kaha ki main jab bhi kota raaj parivaar ke sadasyon ko dekhati thi ki vah congress main he to meraa man dukhata tha
 i consider Kumar Ejiraj Singh like my son Dushyant, but today Kalpana and Eajyaraj's return to our family has strengthened and brought us happiness
 rahul gandhi ne jab jhalawad se lekar kota tak kaa road sho kiya tha to khud rahul gandhi ijyaraj singh ko har jagah aage rakhte the
 However, Ejiraj's desire was to get his wife a ticket from Ladpura from the Congress
 haalanki, ladpura kii seat alpsankhyak kota ke tahat guddu naeem ko chali gai
 Angered by this, Ejiraj Singh left the Congress
 is baat ko lekar bhi rajasthan main charchaa he ki jaipur ke purv rajkumaari diya singh kaa tikat vasundhara raaje ne savai madhopur se kaat diya
 Raje and Diya Singh had a long-running dispute over the land of the Rajmahal Hotel
 tikat katane par diya singh ne kaha ki main unase naaraaz nahin hum kyonki vahi mujhe raajnneeti par lekar ai thi or unke kehane par hi maine chunaav ladaa tha
 Similarly, Vasundhara Raje today formally inducted former MLA of Congress and former President of National Commission for Women Mamta Sharma in Kota

 Kuchh chhuta-sa: Dinesh Pathak is the second novel by the writer Dinesh Pathak
 or hindi main ek lambey arase baad prem ko centre main rakhkar koi upanyaas saamne aayaa he
 In the meantime, many novels came about love affair, but do not tie the boat in such a way that it is slightly different in the sense that the colors of love and love have mixed with full vigor
 vaise kahin-kahin kori bhavukta kii vajah se prem kaa yah rang feekaa or dhoosar bhi dikhaai padataa he
 There are some strange experiments with the language
 sabase zyada khatakane vaali baat he katha ke saath treetment
 The story begins with the present and takes the reader into flashbacks, then ends the story in an awkward way
 katha phir vartmaan main lautakar nahin aati
 The question remains in front of the readers that if Dipankar and Shalmali meet after a long time, then how do the colors of love dissolve within them, which were left behind and left on the path of life
 shaayad isi ant kii vajah se ek tishnagi kaa ehsaas yah upanyaas padhakar hota he
 After years, Dinesh Pathak has passed away just by touching the way Shalmali and Dipankar meet and the feelings that grow in them
 us mulaakaat se katha kii kadiyaan judati hai, yah sahi he lekin katha kii kadiyaan judate hue jahaan khatm hoti hai, vah katha kaa ant nahin ho saktaa
 Do not tie a boat, it is an eternal feeling of love that exists within every person in one form or another
 shalmali or dipankar peshey se praadhyaapak hai or donon ke bich ek samanta he
 Both are concerned with literature
 dipankar kaa judaav hindi sahitya se to shalmali kaa angreji sahitya se
 The two have a kindred relationship
 pahal shalmali kii taraf se hoti he
 this is due to
 sahitya se anuraag rakhane vaali shalmali ke jivan main kahin ek adhuurepan kaa ehsaas he or yahi adhuuraapan use dipankar ke paas le aata he
 The husband does not have time to understand Shalmali's feelings
 vah apane vyavsaay main is kadar ulajhaa hua he ki shalmali uske saath rahakar bhi nahin rahati
 Dipankar is also married and has a full-fledged family
 patni har sukh-dukh main saajheedaar he
 Any 'third' entry between them is completely forbidden
 lekin shalmali ise todatii hui dipankar ke jivan main send lagane main kaamyaab ho jaati he
 His love is not to satisfy the body's hunger
 dipankar kaa samipya paakar vah apane bheetar utarate sukh ko kataraa-kataraa mahasoos karnaa chaahati he, jo use pati yaa gharavaalon se nahin mil paaya he
 She does not know what will be the result of this love, yet wants Dipankar
 kuch dur saath chalane ke baad dipankar ko is baat kaa ehsaas hota he ki vah ghar-parivaar ke saath thik nahin kar rahaa
 He restrains himself and returns to the family
 hindi sahitya main vaise shalmali jaise dheron stri kirdaar mil jaaenge
 So, many people reading novels can see many faces in it
 katha kii shuruyaat bhi sahitya kii raajnneeti or sahityakaron kii uthapatak ke zikr bhar se hui he
 The readers do not give it much detail
 bich-bich main shiksha jagat main faili araajaktaa, satta or vyavastha kii sadaandh par bhi ve sarsari taur par kalam chalaate hai lekin katha ke mul main prem hi he
 He has not led his characters astray even in some emotional moments
 bhumandalikaran ke daur main jab prem jaise shabd 'vailemtine de' tak simat kar rah gaye hon tab aise main yah upanyaas hamen prem ke rang main bhighota bhi he or dubota bhi he

 The place on Mount Bilva near Haridwar is the place where Goddess Parvati had meditated and found Kailash resident Aughdani Shiva in the form of husband
 haridwar main shiv ko ek baar nahin do-do baar apni ardhangini mili
 First Shiva found Sati, the daughter of King Daksha of Daksheshwar, as a wife, and then the same mother Sati was born in the Yagna Kund as Parvati, the home of the Himalayas
 dev rishi naarad kii salaah par parvati ne belapatron se ghire manoram bilva parvat par aakar shiv kii kathor tapasya kii or bholenath ko prasann kar dobaaraa unki ardhangini baniin
 It is a holy place, a short distance from Har ki Pauri, west of Haridwar, where is the ancient temple of the iconic Bilvakeshwar Mahadev
 yahaan sheshnag ke neeche ling rup main viraaje hai bilvakeshwar mahadev
 It is said that Mata Parvati used to calm her hunger by eating Belpatra here, but when the problem of water came to drink, then on the insistence of the gods, Parampita Brahma himself revealed the water of Ganga from his kamandal
 yah aaj bilvakeshwar mandir se mahaj 50 kadam kii duuri par gauri kunda ke naam se prasiddh he
 It is believed that during penance, Goddess Parvati used to bathe in this Gauri Kund and drank the water of this Kund
 bilvakeshwar mahadev mandir, bholebhandari, jataadhari bhagwaan shiv shankar kaa dham he
 This is the taposthali of Mata Parvati where Shiva Shankar is pleased and shows his blessings to the devotees due to the worship and penance
 kehete hai yahaan aakar shraddha se bholenath ko samaran karne bhar se wo prasann ho jate hai or apane bhakton ko dete hai manachaaha vardaan
 The virgin girls who are not getting married or are facing any type of hurdle in their marriage, come to Bilvakeshwar Mahadev temple and anoint the naive Bhandari and offer them a bellpaper, all the troubles coming in the marriage are removed
 One gets the best groom
 mokshadayini ganga kii pavitra laharon ke sparsh maatr se jivan tar jaataa he, samast paap karmon se mukti mil jaati he
 Bathing in this holy water of the Ganges, which is derived from Shiva's shoes, the devotees reach the court of Bhole

 Bilvakeshwar Mahadev sits in this picturesque forest of Belvrikshas
 bilvakeshwar mahadev ke is mandir main pratidin do baar aradhana kaa vidhaan he
 Which starts at 5 in the morning
 praat kaal sabase pehle gauri kunda ke pavitra jal se shivlinga kaa jalabhishek hota he, phir naag pratishthit kar shiv kaa shringaar kiya jaataa he
 People come from far and wide to worship Lord Shiva on this rare gender
 kyonki aisi manyata he ki bilvakeshwar mahadev kaa panchamrita abhishek kar unhen bhaang, datura, belptr or phool chadha die jaaen to bholenath manokamana jald puri kar dete hai
 It is said that a mere offering of Belpatra on Bilvakeshwar Mahadev gives an opportunity to live in heaven for 1 crore years
 manyata he ki sawan main shiv haridwar main nivas karte hai
 That is why the untouchable devotees of Bhole stay here for the whole month and those who are unable to come here in the month of Saavan, come here on Monday, beloved of Shiva and offer prayers
 bilvakeshwar mahadev ke paas hi pratishthit is chamatkaari gauri kunda main snaan kaa mahatv bilvakeshwar mahadev mandir main aradhana se kam nahin he or ye mahatv makar sakranti par or bhi bad jaataa he
 Just as the relationship between the devotee and God is related to birth after birth, similarly Nandi Maharaj is tied to Bholenath by birth
 bholenath tak pahunchane vaali har manokamana yahaan bhi inhen ke kaan main kehani hoti he
 The last aarti of the day has special significance in this Dham of Mahadev, which is concluded here at 6 o'clock
 pujarigan chandan, pushp or baleptr aadi se bilvakeshwar mahadev kaa shringaar karte hai or phir dhoop-batti se aarambh hoti he bilvakeshwar mahadev kii aradhana, jisase bilva parvat kaa sara vaataavaran shivamay ho jaataa he

 party sutron ke anusaar, haalanki dramuk ke pitrupurush is baat ko lekar laal-pile ho rahe hai ki congress 2ji maamle main unki party ko bachaane ke liye kuch nahin kar rahi he, lekin ve upie ke saath apane rishte todane kii nahin soch rahe hai
 "their nature is such that they will wait for a suitable opportunity," says a political analyst close to the DMK
 jab tak unke haath main koi vikalp na ho, ve centre ke saath apane rishte kabhi nahin todate
 '' But he has a plan for Kanimozhi
 ve chahenge ki unki saahitiyik uttaradhikari jab ek shahid kii chhavi lekar jail se baahar nikle, to ve use apni rajnatik uttaradhikari bhi bana den
 Karunanidhi is trying to make Kanimozhi's days spent in jail as a sacrifice for the party

 Karunanidhi's eldest daughter Selvi Selvam, allegedly with the provocation of the Maran brothers and the secretive support of Stalin, was entangled with her father over a demand that had 'no scope of compromise'
 yah maang thi ki kanimoli ko party main koi pad na diya jaae, yahaan tak ki unhen party kii sadsy bane rahane kii bhi ijaajat na di jaae, bhale hi unhen jamaanat mil jaae
 Reason: The involvement of Kanimozhi in the spectrum scandal erupted the dmk's political fortunes in the state and affected its ability to deal with the Center

 The big question being asked in a suppressed language is whether Kanimozhi is the culprit or is he implicated in the crime of someone else, so that the air of the case gets evaporated while more big criminals are roaming freely and remain in power? When comparing the situation in Kanimozhi p
 chidambaram or manmohan singh se kii jaati he to sibiai kaa chuninda tarika ekadam spasht dikhataa he
 India Today's special report (day Gardish, 17 October) examined all the papers in the 2G case and found that both the then finance minister Chidambaram and Manmohan, in connection with the controversial licenses, former Telecom Minister A
 raja ke liye gaye harek faisle se avgat the
 Both had such power that if they wanted, they could stop them
 or iske baavjood, july 2008 main raja, chidambaram or manmohan singh ke bich baithak main unhone raja ke us rukh ko sweekaar kiya tha, jisaki vajah se purv doorsanchaar mantri ab jail main hai
 The case against Kanimozhi rests on his circumstantial political closeness with Raja (which has been publicly revealed by Radia's tapes) and the fact that he is a 20 per cent shareholder in Kalaignar TV
 yah vahi company he, jise shahid balava ke dibi samooh se kathith taur par 200 karod ru
 The time the 2G license was granted to this group
 sibiai kahati he ki paise kaa yah hastantaran 2ji license die jane kii evaj main di gai ghoose tha
 Kanimozhi's lawyer says the money was borrowed, which has now been paid off
 kanimoli kaa hashr tata samooh or nira radia ke ekadam ulat hua he, jinaki khatir ve jahiraa taur par upie kii duusari sarkaar main raja ko phir se doorsanchaar mantri banavaane ke liye lobying kar rahi thim
 The Radia tapes exposed a year ago taped the entire line of dialogue between Radia and Kanimozhi just before the Cabinet was formed in the second UPA government
 in tepon ke ujagar hone ke ek saal baad tata samooh or radia 2ji maamle main sibiai ke radar se puri tarah baahar hai, jabaki kanimoli or raja jail main band hai
 As the famous lawyer and former BJP MP Ram Jethmalani says, the 2G spectrum scam exposes "the question is what is Kanimozhi's crime?" "he says," This clearly shows That the allocation of 2G spectrum was an economic decision of the Union Cabinet and the Prime Minister was also involved in this decision
 to phir unhen abhiyukt kyon nahin banaaya gaya he?''gathbandhan kii aakraamak raajnneeti ke yug main dabaav ke tahat aae bade dal aksar chote sahyogi dalon kii jabardast saudebaaji ke aage samarpan kar dete hai
 These small parties decide their own roles - Telecom Ministry to DMK, Railways to Trinamool Congress and Maharashtra's Home Ministry to NCP
 congress ne 2ji ke maamle main dramuk kii maangon ko lekar ankhen band kiye rakhin, lekin jab uske apane mantri jaanch ke daayre main aa gaye hai to kya apane kamjor sahyogi dalon ko aadhe raste main chhod dena yaa unhen bali kaa bakra bananaa zyada aasaan nahin hoga? dramuk ke halkon main tazatreen charchaa yah he ki ho saktaa he, karunanidhi hamalaa bolne ke pehle kanimoli kii rihaai kaa intjaar hi kar rahe hon
 What has Kanimozhi done that he has been jailed without bail? He is a shareholder in Kalaignar TV
 jethmalani ke anusaar, sabase pehali baat to yah he ki shairdharakon ke paas kaaryakari shakti nahin hoti he
 Otherwise every shareholder should be caught legally
 ''kya aisa koi saboot he jo bataata ho ki dusron ko aparaadh ke liye uksaane main unhone apni naitik or saamaajik haisiyat kaa istemaal kiya he?''unke vakil kehete hai ki vah paisa karj kaa tha, jise byaaj sahit lautaaya gaya tha
 According to Jethmalani, he did not commit any ostentatious act which justifies his imprisonment for nearly six months and repeated bail

 Jethmalani says, "legally it is gruesome

 He is with a jeer

 madhav menon kehete hai, ''yah gambhir maamla he
 Especially because it is very difficult to assess the crime of white collar
 '' lekin jamaanat aakhir adhikaar kaa maamla he
 They make it clear that this is the rule, not the exception

 "the 2G hearing has added a new principle to the bail law and its need indicates that the judicial system is not functioning effectively," he says
 ''rebeka jon ke liye, kisi vakil ke nazariye se yah atyant chunauteepurn maamla he
 "it touches very complex elements of a whole range of laws like corporate, criminal, telecommunications," she says
 '' lekin jamaanat se lekar aarope patron tak, in kanoonon ko lagu karne main ek tarah kii buddhiheenata dikhti he
 Recalling the Jain hawala scandal in the mid-1990s, she says, "that too was a case of corruption of bigots, which included many important people in Indian politics
" lekin tab kisi ko bhi jamaanat dene se inkaar nahin kiya gaya
 No one was punished, simply because they were rich and power-rich
 ''kaha jaataa he ki bade maamalon se kharaab kanoon banate hai
 And Kanimozhi, or her personally persecuting questions, can only be understood within the scope of the hearing in which she is involved
 agar koi or daur hota, to unhen adaalaton se kuch or hi hasil hua hota
 But not in such a dangerous era, when everyone considers their opinion as 'holy' and everyone has their own declared vision
 chaahe yah unki badakismati ho, nijee traasadee ho yaa bahut bade paimaane par jaij hashr ho, ummid he ki unki kismat kaa faisla kanoon ke shashan ke mutabik hi hoga
 But with all the exams they have gone through, even before the 2G hearing begins, there is an immediate message for politicians, law makers and ordinary citizens: Can we judge people by different criteria? There are no longer queues of cars in front of Kanimozhi's palatial bungalow in Chennai

 Ever since North Korea has sat on the throne, it has done nuclear tests 4-4 times till now
 jabaki uske pita kim jong il ne do baar is test ko anjaam diya tha
 But the test through which Kim Jong is claiming to increase the strength of his country, the same test has started to wreak havoc in his own country
 pareekshan ke site effectauttar korea ne apane ab tak ke sabhi test jis pyongang-ri test site par kiya usne uttar korea kii zamin ke neeche kii tectonic platon ko ched diya he

 The US Geological Survey, along with Vienna's nuclear test ban Treaty Organization, have also issued warnings that if North Korea's Supreme Leader does any further tests, it will have geographically fatal consequences

 Nearly three earthquake tremors have been felt on the reactor scale throughout the region in the last few days
 jinke baad vahaan ke log dehshat main hai
 But Kim Jong has nothing to do with this
 wo apni kamyaabi kaa jashn manaa rahaa he
 Previously done the hydrogen bomb test, North Korea also knows that its supreme leader is destined to fulfill his craze is fatal
 iskaa andaaza is baat se lagaaiye ki parmaanu pareekshan ke alaava taanashaah kim hidrogen bam kaa bhi pareekshan kar chukaa he
 Which is 10 times deadlier than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima Nagasaki of America

 narendra modi ne pradhanmantri banane ke baad muslim samaaj main vivaadit teen talaak ko khatm karne kaa bidaa uthaaya or teen talaak adhyadesh bill (triple talaq ordinance bill) ko sansad se paas karaane ke liye unki sarkaar ne edi chotii kaa jor laga diya, lekin loksabhaa main bill ko aasaani se paas karaane ke baad rajyasabha main paas karaane ke liye sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he
 However, in the survey of Aaj Tak and Karvy Insights, people supported it and believe that this is a big step towards women empowerment
 teen talaak khatm karne ko lekar modi sarkaar kii koshish kya mahila shashaktikaran kii disha main aglaa kadam he, ke sawaal par ajtak or karvi incits ke survey main yah baat saamne ai ki desh ke 63 fisadi log ise sahi maanate hai, jabaki 26 fisadi logon kaa kahana he ki yah sahi nahin he
 There are 11 per cent people who are not in a position to give their opinion about this question
 isi sawaal par uttar pradesh main karaae gaye survey main 71 fisadi log aise hai jo maanate hai ki modi sarkaar kaa yah kaam mahilaon kii shashaktikaran kii disha main bada kadam he
 Whereas only 13 percent people say that this step of the Central Government is not right

 The survey of Aaj Tak and Karvy Insights, the mood of the nation, shows that people are satisfied with the government's effort on triple talaq

 The bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha after it was passed by the Lok Sabha, due to which the government had to bring an ordinance again on the anti-triple talaq bill

 Desai is defending
 dow
 Aggarwal states that the IMA is confident that Dr
 desai ke khilaaf koi maamla nahin banataa
 He says that, “dr
 desai ke khilaaf jo jaanch hui he, usamen saal 1990 se lekar 2010 tak ke 20 saalon main unke khilaaf koi aarope sabit nahin huya he yani unka record saaf he
 When we came to know that all his disproportionate assets cases were over, we wrote to the WMA that he could be retaken for the post of President
 iske baad hamaara patrachaar WMA ke saath hua, jisamen unhone poocha ki kya unke khilaaf koi cese lambit he? phir hamane sibiai to likhaa
 " to aakhir WMA se ye galati kaise ho gai
 In response to the NDTV India question, the WMA states that, Dr
 desai kaa chunaav ieme kii ore se bheji gai soochna ke aadhaar par kiya gaya
 Actually the letter given by CBI about Dr
 agarwal kar rahe hai isamen do maamalon ke baaki rahane kaa bhi zikr he
 The first is a bribery case in which the Supreme Court has stayed and the second is a case of fraud and criminal conspiracy, on which the charges have not yet been framed
 yani in donon hi maamalon main dow
 An FIR is yet to be filed against Ketan Desai
 WMA president kii haisiyat kaaphi myne rakhti he, lekin ye to saaf he ki in pad ke liye puure tathy yaa to pesh nahin kiye gaye yaa phir ieme se kaagazadon ko samajhane main galati hui
 The question is also being raised whether Dr
 Desai used his political clout to lobby internationally
 tippaniyan In his response, Desai says, "WMA is not a political institution
 ye ek enjio he, jisamen 110 deshon kii medical association ke sadsy hote hai
 No political force or manipulations can affect these members
 yah kahana sach kaa mazaaq udaana hoga ki 110 deshon ke sadasyon ko apni raajnneetik takat istemaal kar main bilkul nirvirodh chunaa gaya
 "the question is why Ketan Desai's name for the post of WMA President? enditivi india ke is sawaal ke jawaab main dow
 "our only one man can become a WMA President," says Aggarwal
 dow
 Desai has been elected president
 ab ham apane haq kyon choden? agar ham ise chodenge to hamaari baari phir 30 saal ke baad aegi
 i cannot go to WMA and say that instead of someone else, make someone president
 '' In his written reply, Desai said, "in 2010, once again selfish elements made false allegations of bribery and disproportionate assets against me
 akhbaaron main do karod rupee ke saath mere range haathon pakade jane kii jo khabar chhapi, vah puri tarah se galat he
 Me and my family got a total of 53 thousand rupees
 isaki gahan jaanch hui or jaanch main saamne aayaa ki mere or mere parivaar ke paas har paise kaa hisaab tha

 Famous writer and columnist Shobha De on Monday attacked BJP candidate Sadhvi Pragya Thakur from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat

 After the Emergency, the VHP under the guidance of Moropant Pingale ji and led by Ashok Sinhal ji from the Sangh moved hesitantly since 1980 and National Integration Yatra was organized from across the country with the vase of Ganga ji, which gave the VHP a new consciousness

 The central government completely ignored the VHP movements in the context of the Ram Janmabhoomi of saints or later against the Tehri Dam being built on Ganga ji
 santon kii bhi upeksha hi hui
 From 2004 to 2012, the VHP was mostly involved in organizational work or some problems
 ab vihip ke saamne punah tejasvi rup praapt karne kii chunauti he
 They have to find new issues
 sanghathan ko dhardaar bananaa hoga or satta ke prati samvaad or sangharsh main santulan sadhana hoga

 (lekhak bijepi ke purv mahasachiv or vichaarak hai) Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted a tweet a few hours after the agitated protesters took to the streets on December 22 to protest against the barbaric gang rape of a 23-year-old paramedical student in the capital Delhi
 i made a big mistake keeping silent when the protests started in the summer
 mujhe ummid he ki meri galati sabak kaa kaam karegi
 Unfortunately, even his best friend Rahul Gandhi did not listen to him
 us din yah yuva netaa, jise desh kaa bhavishya bataaya ja rahaa he, goa main nau maheene pehle hui party kii chunavi haar kaa jayja lene ke liye niyamit baithak ko sambodhit kar rahaa tha
 The demonstrations in Delhi were basically youth demonstrations for the youth
 iske baavjood is desh kaa swayambhu 'youth iken’ agle din 23 disambar ko pradarshnakariyon ke ek pratinidhimandal ke saath apni maa ke ghar par hui aupchaarik baithak main pehali baar dikhaai diya
 We have not seen or heard Rahul since then
 unki yah gaiyr-maujuudagi pradarshnakariyon kii najaron se bachi na rah saki or dilli ke jantar-mantar par 26 disambar ko hawa main yah naaraa gunj rahaa tha, 'huha huha rahul gandhi chuha
 "smriti Kapoor, a 21-year-old student of Delhi University present there, said," We are here in such a cold
 hamaare netaa kahaan hai? chuttee bitaane gaye hai kya? koun sunegaa hamen or un muddon ko koun sulajhaayega jinhen ham uthaa rahe hai?” uske or kai sawaal the, lekin unka koi jawaab nahin tha
 Till now being called the face of the younger generation, Rahul became a symbol of absent young leaders this time
 sadakon par faile gusse or soshal media par joardaar aalochana ke bich ek bhi yuva netaa ne apni peedi kii sud lene kii koshish nahin kii
 Akhilesh Yadav, 39, who became the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh by making big promises, was busy with the two-week Saifai Festival that began on 15 December
 jis din lakhanu main pradarshnakariyon ne unke daftar kaa gheraav kiya, ve apni patni dimple or aalaa adhikariyon ke saath saifai main baithe bollywood sitaron ke latake-jatke dekh rahe the
 Incidentally, the victim's family hails from Uttar Pradesh's Ballia district, so after the girl's death on December 29, she expressed condolences in the name of the concern for Rs 20 lakh
 kii aarthik madad kaa elaan kar daalaa
 This time the demonstrations involved the entire youth vote bank, yet no youth leader bothered to step out of his house
 twitor se lekar fasebuk tak virodh kii awaajen utani hi teevr thim, iske banisbat shaayad hi kisi yuva iken ne apane branded laptop par naujavaanon se judye kii koshish kii
 In a way, this was the extent of neglect
 ek baar ko maan lete hai ki sadak par nikalne main unki suraksha ko khatra ho saktaa tha, lekin online samvaad main aakhir kya aadchan thi?india today ne agali peedi ke in saansadon se jaanane kii koshish kii ki aakhir unhone pradarshnakariyon ko nazarandaaj kyon kiya? unamem kuch ne hamaari jigyaasa kaa jawaab diya
 They include Milind Deora, Priya Dutt, Sachin Pilot, Sandeep Dixit, Jyotiraditya Scindia from Congress and Anurag Thakur and Varun Gandhi from BJP
 rashtravaadi congress kii agaatha sangama or supriya sule ne bhi apni baat rakhi
 Some leaders defended his absence but also urged him to keep his name hidden
 kuch netaaon kii chamadi bahut moti nikali, masalan deependra hooda, dushyant singh, jitin prasad, ajay maakan or ashok tanvar ne baar-baar sandesh bhejne ke baavjood palatakar kol karne kii jarurat nahin samajhi
 Congress MP Naveen Jindal spoke to us, but as soon as he came to know what we were going to ask, he apologized and later asked us to call
 lekin unhone hamen kol karne kaa vaada puraa nahin kiya
 Maken tweeted, "we have failed as a society," although he did not answer why he did not come on the road himself
 yah baat isliye bhi zyada myne rakhti he kyonki adhiktar pradarshan unke sansadeey kshetra nai dilli main hue the
 Like the Congress leaders, the young BJP leaders also kept their eyes closed
 bijepi kii yuva ikai ke pramukh 38 varshiya anuraag thakur ne is avadhi main apane grih rajya himachal main hi rahanaa munasib samaj
 Yes, his father-led BJP government has lost in the recent elections
 unhone safai kuch yun di, ''main to (20 disambar ko) chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad se hi himachal main hum lekin party kii yuva ikai ke kaaryakarta india get par maujuud the
 By the way, Thakur was seen climbing the dais at the BJP headquarters in Delhi on December 27 to greet Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 thakur kaa kahana he ki ve pradarshnon se isliye dur rahe kyonki un par maamle ke 'raajnneetikaran’ kaa aarope lag jaataa
 When we asked him if he had formed Justice j to enact a law against rape
 es
 If Varma plans to send some suggestions to the committee, he said, "of course, i will come back on January 6 and meet him
" ve mere bade achche mitra hai
 "thakur may not know that the last date for sending suggestions is January 5, or he may not have bothered to know
 ek anya yuva saansad bijepi ke 32 varshiya varun gandhi kii ek jhalak hamen agast, 2011 main anna hajaare kii dilli main hui raily main mili thi, lekin is baar ve sire se gaayab rahe
 They said that they wanted to meet the protesters as they are concerned about the issue, but could not do so because of the wife being in the hospital
 unhone kaha, ''main pita banane vaala hum, lekin use kuch dikkatein aa rahi hai
 i have to be together constantly
 ”kuch duusare yuva congressi netaaon kaa daawa he ki ve pradarshnakariyon se milanaa to chaahate the lekin party ke varisht netaaon kii ore se sakaaratmak sanket nahin mili
 Obviously, they do not want to bring their names to the fore
 aashcharya kii baat yah he ki mahila saansad bhi is dauraan kahin nahin dikhin
 In the meantime, 40-year-old Congress MP Jyoti Mirdha had to go to Nagaur in her constituency to settle a case
 vaise, unhone justise verma cameti ko kuch thos suzav bheje hai
 Since he is a doctor himself, one of his suggestions is that castration or chemical castration of rape accused will not be okay as it is not effective
 unhone yah suzav bhi bheja he ki naaballig kii kanoonee paribhaasha par punarvichaar hona chahie
 Currently, a person under 18 years of age is considered a minor
 is baar hue gang rape main ek aaropee naaballig he or is bahaane vah kadi sajaa se batch saktaa he, haalanki use sabase zyada barbar bataaya gaya he
 Not only this, Mirdha has also attached reports of some international studies in support of her suggestion that boys become adults at the age of 10 and girls at the age of 6
 iske maddenjar kanoon main yathochit badlaav karne kii jarurat he
 Now the results needed: Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology, 36-year-old Milind Deora is one of the rare young leaders who have been active on social media since the rape
 unhone twitor par suzav maange, lekin sadak par yuvaaon ke bich aana unhone uchit nahin samajha
 In the conversation, he admitted that the leaders have suppressed the voice of the youth, but he blamed the entire political section on this
 unhone kaha, ''main nahin maanata ki apni umr or langikta ke aadhaar par sirf kuch netaaon ko sakriy hona chahie tha
 The truth is that the entire political section could not communicate with the youth from the beginning
 ummid he ki ab se kam-se-kam ham saath milakar kaam kar sakenge or unke aakrosh ko un thos upayon main tabdeel kar paaenge jinase mahilaayein khud ko surakshit mahasoos kar saken or paaramparik maansikta ko chunauti de saken
 "minister of Corporate Affairs, 35-year-old Sachin Pilot believes that a 'more direct and organized response' should have come from the entire political class in response to the anger of boys and girls on the streets, which could have long-term consequences
" 
 unhone mana ki netaaon ko is nitant nirmam ghatana se sabak seekhney kii jarurat he
 He clearly stated, "the youth want concrete action, they want relief and satisfaction that can be seen clearly, and they want it to happen as soon as possible
" hamen unki baat rakhni chahie or nattejey dene chahie
 Priya Dutt confined the conversation to herself
 is 44 varshiya saansad ne balaatkaar peedita ke saath ekajutata pradarshit karne ke liye 22 disambar ko apane kshetra main bandra sthit carter road par janayatra yojit kii thi
 She says that the rape and violence case against women should have been resolved long ago
 ve kahati hai, ''hamaare man main kanoon kaa bhay hona chahie
 Crimes against women should have higher conviction rates
 koi aisa tarika hona chahie jisase peedita nahin balki balaatkaari khud ko kalankit mahasoos kare
 "home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde did not go to the protest venue because the Intelligence Bureau had expressed fears that a small section of the crowd at India Gate could have taken advantage of it to make the situation worse
 unhone ek intervyuu main daawa kiya tha ki ve is gusse ko samaj sakate hai kyonki ve teen betiyon ke pita hai
 His youngest daughter, Praniti Shinde, 32, is an MLA from North Solapur
 unhone apane vidhansabha kshetra main 26 disambar ko ek balaatkaar peedita ko god liya tha
 According to him, he did whatever was under his father's jurisdiction
 ve chaahati hai ki balaatkaar virdohi kanoon main sanshodhan kaa kaam jaldi puraa karavaaen
 Obviously, they are giving voice to the wishes of common people of the country
 pradarshnakariyon ko flash mob (achaanak umadi bheed) qaraar dene vaale pi
 Disenchanted leaders like Chidambaram also had to react a lot
 unhone sweekaar kiya ki sarkaar ko pataa hi nahin he ki aisi bheed se kaise nipta jaataa he
 In a press briefing on 26 December, he said, "flash mob is a new phenomenon
 kabhi to ve naachne-gane ke liye ikattha hote hai, to kabhi pradarshan karne ke liye aa pahunchate hai
 We have to pay attention to this
 main nahin samajhataa ki inase nipatane kii hamaari puri taiyaari he
 We need to make SOP (standard procedure for dealing with these)
 ”kuch saansadon ne is ghatnakram se judye kii koshish bhi kii to ve vivaad main aa gaye
 48-year-old Sandeep Dixit was the only leader to reach India Gate, just a day after the protest began on 22 December
 unke mutabik, ek din pehle ve kisi paariwarik shaadi main baahar gaye hue the
 He told, "I reached there directly from the airport, but i was driven away by pushing
 koi sarthak samvaad nahin ho sakaa
 "he went there again in the afternoon
 pradarshnkaree bikhare hue the, unka koi sangathit samooh nahin tha
 He claimed, "who would i talk to?" Eventually, i called a group of protesters to my house
 unase main lagaataar sampark main hum” lekin unhone sweekaar kiya ki sarkaar yuva pradarshnakariyon se samvaad kar paane main naakaam rahi he
 He said, "this is a new generation connected through various means of communication, so the government should also look at using cyber world to talk to them
" ”agaatha sangama ne bataaya ki 29 disambar ko ve jantar-mantar par mombatti lekar pahunchi thim, lekin kisi ne un par dhyaan nahin diya
 "I was there," the 32-year-old NCP MP told India Today
 sangharsh ko samarthan dene ke liye main vahaan netaa nahin, balki ek mahila kii haisiyat se gai thi
 Sangma also spoke to the youth there
 unhone kaha ki yuva saansadon ko ''mahilaon kii pratishtha or suraksha ko lekar zyada mukhar or unke bare main sochane vaala bananaa hoga
 Supriya Sule, 43, an NCP MP, denied that the young leader did not come forward
 unhone kaha, ''mujhe nahin lagata ki ve nadaarad the
 Everyone works in their own way
 ”yachana nahin, haq kaa jawaab dena hogamanav sansaadhan vikaas rajyamantri, 56 varshiya shashi tharur ne is dauraan ek twit karke vivaad paidaa kar diya ki agar ladki ke mata-pita ko aapatti na ho to uskaa naam saarvajanik kiya janaa chahie taaki uske 'astitv’ ko dobaaraa sthapit kiya ja sake or nae balaatkaar virdohi kanoon kaa us par namakaran karke peedita ko sammaan diya ja sake
 Right from the beginning of the protests, Tharoor was constantly tweeting about this, though he remained in Thiruvananthapuram from 22 December
 unhone bataaya ki ve 27 disambar ko vahaan hue ek candal march or virodh baithak main gaye the
 "I was in touch with the protesters there," he said
 maine unase unki chintaaon or aakankshaon ke bare main poocha ki sarkari karrwai ke sandarbh main aakhir ve kya chaahate hai? is baatcheet ne pradarshnon main vyaapt tanaav ko kaaphi had tak dur karne kaa kaam kiya
 "tharoor admitted that if he had done this in Delhi also, it would have had the same effect
 darasal, yuva netaa apni peedi se kate hue hai or aisa isliye he kyonki unki rajnatik viraasat bahut puraani pad chuki he
 At least 80 percent of the young leaders in the Lok Sabha come from political families
 unhone kabhi aise bharat ko nahin janaa jo apana haq maangata ho
 He has always been accustomed to seeing India standing in folded hands
 yaachak mudra vaale isi bharat kii ek tasviir hamen 2 janvari ko urja rajyamantri jyotiraditya sindhiya ke 27, safadarajang road sthit sarkari awaas par dekhne ko mili, jahaan gwalior se aae logon kaa hujum unke intjaar main khadaa tha
 An old man came to the village to demand a road, while another man came to complain about the hospital where his nephew is undergoing treatment
 donon fariyadi sindhiya se ek peedi pehle ke bujurg the, phir bhi apana kaam karwaane ke liye ve unke pairon par gir pade
 According to Scindia, he was in Gwalior during the performance and participated in the protest there
 unhone daawa kiya, ''agar main yahaan hota, to kisi bhi acroshit naagarik kii hi tarah main bhi apni pratikriya detaa
 "A political commentator says that the age of the so-called youth brigade in politics may be short, but their thinking is traditional
 ” is baar ke pradarshnon ne dikhaa diya ki hindustan ko ab ek nai kism kii raajnneeti or nae kism ke netaaon kii jarurat he
 In the wake of the voice of the youth raising their demand, it is now up to the youth leaders to leave the age-old ruling sense and join the people in the role of the grassroots leader

 The credit of taking power from Congress in Gujarat and putting it in bjp's bag goes to Keshubhai Patel
 haalanki keshubhai patel ne 2012 main bijepi se baghawat karke jab alag kismat ajamai to patidaar samaaj ne unhen bhav nahin diya
 Now once again, 24-year-old Hardik Patel from Patel community has raised the flag against BJP
 sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya hardik patel bijepi ke liye 2012 ke keshubhai patel se bhi badi chunauti sabit honge? hardik ke saath dikh rahaa patidaar kya bijepi ke khilaaf vot karegaa? kya hardik patel gujarat main narendra modi ke rath ko rokane main kaamyaab ho paaenge?gujarat kaa king mekargujrat mempatidaar samudayakareeb 16 fisadi he

 However, the politics took such a turn that Keshubhai Patel had to step down from the post of Chief Minister after seven months
 iske baad 1998 main keshubhai dobaaraa mukhyamantri bane or kareeb chaar saal tak mukhyamantri rahe
 Later, Narendra Modi was replaced by BJP as Chief Minister

 There was a rally of Keshubhai Patel, a fierce opponent of Modi in Rajkot, a Patidar stronghold
 maidan khachaakhach bharaa tha or 'bapa tum sangharsh karo, ham tumhaare saath hai’ ke naare se gunj rahaa tha
 Keshubhai may have heard this slogan many times during his political phase, but this time it was different
 2012 main keshubhai patel bijepi ke liye nahin, balki apane liye vot maang rahe the
 Keshubhai grabbed the mic and said that it is for you people to ensure that BJP does not win even a single seat from this area
 wo ye baat apni har raily main doharaa rahe the
 But when the election results came, all the wishes of Keshubhai Patel were lost
 keshubhai kii party ko mahaj 2 siten milin or kareeb 4 fisadi vot mili
 As soon as the results were clear, Narendra Modi first went to Keshubhai Patel and fed him sweets
 nateezon ne saaf kar diya ki keshubhai patidaar samudaay ke netaa kabhi rahe honge lekin aaj modi kaa vakt he or gujarat kii raajnneeti main keshubhai kii koi ahmiyat nahin bachi he
 The BJP did not suffer a great loss due to Keshubhai Patel's rebellion
 wo mahaj kuch siton par asar daal paae
 Professor Jai Prakash Pradhan of Gujarat Central University says that former Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel made a mistake in 2012 by giving people a third option
 naaraaz patel vot to unhen mili, lekin isse na to bijepi ko nuksaan hua or na hi congress ko phayda
 This time, the Patels have the only option of displeasing the BJP
 hardik bane bijepi kii chunautinarendra modi ke gujarat se dilli aane se rajya main bijepi kii pakad kamjor hui he
 It was only after 2014 that the Patidar reservation movement arose under the leadership of Hardik Patel
 patidaaron ke is andolan ne dhire-dhire puure gujarat ke yuvaaon ko apane saath mila liya
 The Patel agitation started under the leadership of Hardik Patel increased the problems of the BJP
 isi kaa nateeja rahaa ki 2015 main hue jila panchayat chunaav main saurashtra kii 11 main se 8 siton par congress vijayi rahi
 BJP is upset with Hardik Patel's challenge
 bijepi hardik kii kaat ke liye harsambhav koshish main lagi he, lekin abhi tak patidaaron par chadha bukhaar utarane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Hardik's rallies are crowding the Patidar community
 yuva berozegaar garib patidaaron kaa ek bada khemaa hardik ko samarthan kar rahaa he
 There is also a large number of youth in Gujarat who have not seen the rule of any party other than BJP
 udhar bijepi ke saath patidaaron ke paise vaale log abhi bhi jude hue hai
 In such a situation, how big a challenge is made to prevent BJP from coming to power, it will be clear at the time of counting of votes on 18 December

 Amidst this same smell, two elders were found sitting in the kiosks, who were doing the government work with great effort
 photo agar aap dhyaan se dekhen to ditisi yani dilli transport corporation ke is khokhe main bason ke conductor apni root kaa lekha-jokha dete milenge
 Show cause notice is very important in government job
 isi ke chalate is khokhe main baithe do sarkari karmchaariyon ke naam nahin bataa saktaa hum
 But i had great respect for these two elders, who are fearlessly carrying out government work amidst this 'terrorism' of stink
 isi khokhe ke bagal main ek maansik rogi baitha tha, jo peshaab nahin, balki pet kaa vajan halkaa kar rahaa tha
 Seeing the mic and camera in my hand broke the patience of that government employee
 khokha dikhaate bolaa 10 lakh logon ko rozaana ghar pahunchane vaali ditisi kaa ye haal dekhie, yahaan na pani he, na bijli he, upar se (us maansik rogi or peshaab kar rahe do chaar logon ko dikhaakar) in besharmon ko shame bhi nahin aati he
 You stop here for five minutes and show your son
 
 
 ham log kya karen yaa to is peshaab ke bich kaam karo yaa naukari chodo
 
 
 i started looking at my armpits
 peshaab kii gandh tikhe tareeke se dimag par hamalaa karti mahasoos hui
 i wanted to run away from there
 tabhi us bujurg ne kaha chhodie, aap kya khabar banaaenge
 
 
 He jerked his head and sat in that kiosk
 jahaan peshaab or shouch kaa cocktail badboo kisi baj kii tarah us ditisi ke khokhe ko daboche hua tha, khokhe ke baahar khadey conductor kii aawaaj sunai padi jaldi karo taaoo kyon durgandh sungha rahe ho
 i too quickly sat in the car and quickly closed the door, took a long breath and moved forward

 mahajabeen- thik he thankyuu (phone daaud ko de detii he) The Gujarat government told the Supreme Court how Asaram's son Narayan Sai became a Krishna by putting peacock feathers on his head and women danced with him as a gopi
 unke hajaaron samarthak hai jo hangaamaa kar sakate hai
 On this, the Supreme Court remarked that we are surprised that all this is happening in progressive and developing Gujarat, not in any tribal area
 darasal gujarat hycourt ne narayan sai ko maa ke ilaaj ke liye 4 may se teen hafte kii antarim jamaanat di he
 Along with this, conditions have also been imposed that they will be under police surveillance for 24 hours and will not go anywhere other than living and hospital
 is aadesh ke khilaaf gujarat sarkaar ne supreme court main arji daakhil kii thi or kaha tha ki oparation ke liye koi taarikh mukarrar nahin he
 If Sai is thrown out, law and order can deteriorate as thousands of supporters can create a ruckus while going back to jail
 tippaniyan However, now the Supreme Court has ordered that Sai be granted interim bail only after the date of operation is fixed
 sunwaayee ke dauraan justise ties thakur ne poocha ki kya narayan sai bhi apane pita asaram kii tarah mashhoor hai
 On this matter, the counsel for the Gujarat government said that to save himself, Sai tried to bribe the police inspector for Rs 8 crore
 yahaan tak ki ek ahm gavaah kii hatya bhi ho chuki he
 He has thousands of supporters and the government suspects that he can create a ruckus
 court ne kaha ki agar police ko lagata he ki in sabake peeche sai hai to in maamalon main bhi unke khilaaf karrwai honi chahie
 Narayan Sai has been in jail since December 2013 in the rape case of two sisters in Surat
 isse pehle supreme court kah chukaa he ki jab tak ahm logon kii gavaahi nahin hoti, unhen niyamit jamaanat nahin di ja sakati
 In fact, Gujarat High Court has granted interim bail of three weeks from May 4 to Narayan Sai for the treatment of his mother
 saath hi sharten bhi lagaai hai ki wo 24 ghante police nigaraanee main rahenge or rahane kii jagah va aspataal ke alaava kahin nahin jaaenge
 The Gujarat government had filed an application in the Supreme Court against this order and said that there was no date for the operation
 agar sai ko baahar nikaala jayega to kanoon vyavastha bighad sakati he kyonki hajaaron samarthak waapas jail le jate vakt hangaamaa kar sakate he
 The comments haalanki ab supreme court ne aadesh diya he ki oparation kii taarikh tay hone par hi sai ko antarim jamaanat di jaaegi
 During the hearing, Justice TS Thakur asked if Narayan Sai was also famous like his father Asaram
 is baat par gujarat sarkaar ke vakil ne bataaya ki khud ko bachaane ke liye sai ne police inspector ko 8 karod rupee kii ghoose dene kii koshish kii
 Even an important witness has been killed
 unke hajaaron samarthak hai or sarkaar ko andeh he ki wo koi hangaamaa kar sakate hai
 The court said that if the police feel that there are Sai behind all this then action should be taken against them in these cases also
 narayan sai disambar 2013 se hi surat main do bahanon ke rape cese main jail main band hai
 Earlier the Supreme Court has said that regular bail cannot be granted unless important people testify

 ranbir kapur or katrina caff ko pehali baar kisi film ke liye saath cast kiya gaya tha or yaheen donon main pyaar ho gaya
 But both kept quiet at that time as Katrina was dating Tabassalam and had Deepika got Ranbir's name tattooed
 lekin aisi baaten kabhi chhipaae nahin chhipatin or jaise hi salmaan ko isaki bhanak lagi, unka gussa to saatven aasmaan par pahunchnaa hi tha
 However, Salman had then warned Katrina that Ranbir would break his heart and end his relationship with him right there
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yah maamla 2009 kaa he jabasalmaan katrinase is maamle par baat karne ke liye unke bandra vaale ghar gaye the
 At the same time, Salman had said to Katrina while shouting, 'don't go ahead with Ranbir
 tum galati kar rahi ho or ek din vah tumhaara dil tod degaa
 According to the reports now coming, Salman had tried a lot to convince Katrina at that time but he did not change his decision

 maharashtra ke yavatmal jile kii kalavati bandurkar kii beti papita ramteke ne kuen main kudakar aatmahatya kii koshish kii
 It is being told that the people present on the spot somehow saved them
 vidarbha ke jalka gaanv main rahane vaaleen kalavati ke kisaan pati ne kuch varshon pehle aatmahatya kar lee thi
 Kalawati had suddenly come into the limelight when Congress President Rahul Gandhi went to her house to meet her and then mentioned Kalavati in the Parliament about the issue of farmer widows
 kalavati ke kul aath bachche the, jinamein se do kii maut pehle hi ho chuki he
 The latest case is that of his 28-year-old daughter, Papita Ramteke, who jumped into a well on Friday in the old court complex of Sidna in Maregaon
 haalanki us vakt vahaan maujuud logon ne unhen fouran bachaa liya
 However, the reason behind the attempt to commit suicide is not known yet
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki papita apni maa se alag rah rahi thim or paariwarik kalah se tang aakar unhone aatmahatya kii koshish kii
 It is worth mentioning that Kiklavati lives in Jalka village of Maregaon taluka of Yavatmal district
 unke kisaan pati ne rin na chukaa paane kii vajah se 2005 main aatmahatya kar lee thi
 In 2008, Rahul went to meet Gandhiklavati at her house and then discussed her in Parliament, which suddenly brought her to the spotlight

 Former Jharkhand Chief Minister Madhu Koda, who has tasted the joy and sorrow of power in the last two years, now sees no silver lining in the current assembly
 unka kahana he, ''maujuuda sadan main vaikalpik sarkaar ke gathan kii koi sambhaavnaaen najar nahin aati hai
 Not only this, President's rule is not the solution to any problem in a democracy
 taaja chunaavon kaa maarg prashast karne ke liye maujuuda vidhansabha ko bhang kar diya janaa chahie
 Koda is the chairman of the upa's steering committee in Jharkhand
 unhone ab chibasa loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladane kaa faisla liya he
 Currently, this seat is held by Congress MP Bagun Sumbrui
 unhone kaha, ''ab upie gathbandhan ko mere samarthan kaa faisla lenaa he
 i am very confident about my victory
 '' maujuuda halaat par asantosh jataate hue kodaa ne kaha, ''mere kaarykaal main rajya main sab sahi chal rahaa tha
 Suddenly i was forcibly removed from power and since then there has been a period of political instability in the state
 '' Uttar Pradesh assembly elections are being started from western Uttar Pradesh
 guuruuvaar ko prachaar kaa aakhri din he
 The electoral noise will stop after 5 pm
 haalanki netaa jansampark karte rahenge
 There are about 27 districts in western Uttar Pradesh where Jats and Gurjars are decisive
 inamen se 15 jilon kii 73 vidhansabha siton par 11 farvari ko matdaan hona he
 Let me tell you that in the last assembly elections in western Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Lehar got a tough fight from the BSP
 sapa-bispi main hui thi kadi takkar2012 main hue vidhansabha chunaavon ke aankadon par najar daalen to pashchimi uttar pradesh main sapa ko 24, bispi ko 23, bijepi ko 13, areldi ko 9 or congress ko 5 siten mili thim
 The Math seat of Mathura came to bjp's account during the by-election
 vahiin mathura kii govardhan seat se areldi vidhayak ab bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai
 In the same way, RLD mlas from Aligarh's Barauli Assembly have also joined BJP
 dhruvikaran kaa phayda bijepi ke haq messgast 2013 main hue mujffarnagar dange ke baad pashchimi uttar pradesh do virgon main banta hua najar aata he
 During the Lok Sabha elections in this part of the state, the effect of polarization was clearly visible
 hindu bahulya ilaaka hone ke chalate bijepi ko thodi raahat kii ummid he
 At the same time, Mayawati is engaged in cultivating dalit-muslim alliances
 badal chukaa he samikarnaarakshan ke mudde par naaraaz jat birdari is baar bijepi se alag areldi kii ore jane kaa man bana chuki he
 Ajit Singh has been saying clearly in previous rallies that no matter what happens, he will not form an alliance with BJP
 matlab saaf he jaaton main panape gusse ko bhunaane main choudhary koi kasar nahin chhodana chaahate
 So, because of this, Akhilesh had done this, according to political experts, Akhilesh had the feeling of displeasure of the Jats with the BJP
 ve jaanate the ki agar areldi ke saath gathbandhan kiya to jat vot gathbandhan ke saath nahin aayega
 The reason is simple, increasing communal tension in western UP
 taaja halaat is baat se saaf inkaar karte hai ki muslim or jat ek hi party ko vot den
 For this reason, fighting separate elections of RLD will be beneficial for Akhilesh
 maaya ne bhi chali behtareen chalaupi main chunavi parinaam mudda aadhaarit kam jati aadhaarit zyada hote hai
 In UP, there is a common saying that "as much as one can share"
 pashchimi uttar pradesh ne mayawati ne bispi ke ummidavaar chun-chun kar utaare hai
 There are a good number of Jats, Muslims and Dalits in this region
 mayawati ne soshal ejineering ke naam par jaateey sameekaran saadhane kii puri koshish kii he
 RLD is also ready
 RLD with strong hold in western UP is in its bad phase
 pichley chunaavon main areldi ko kul 9 siten mili thim
 After the alliance between the sp-congress, the political equations will change on a much larger scale
 agast 2013 main muzaffarnagar ke dange ke baad se jat or muslimon main bikharaav aa gaya tha areldi inhen phir se ekajute karne kii koshish main pichley kaaphi samay se lagi hui he
 Jat and Muslim have been the voters of RLD only
 agar choudhary kaa plan kaamyaab ho gaya to ek baar phir unki party pashchimi upi main apana prabhaav jamaati najar aegi
 Local issues will continue: bjp's position in the assembly elections in western Uttar Pradesh has not been better, but in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had achieved unprecedented success
 aam chunaavon main bijepi ko mili is samarthan par vidhansabha chunaavon main saamaajik mudde haaavee ho sakate hai
 If western UP is Jat and Muslim dominated, then the issues will also be related to these sections
 muslim varg sapa kaa paramparaagat vot bank rahaa he aise main jat samudaay se jude mudde bijepi ko chunaavon main baari pad sakate hai
 Let us tell you that the BJP, which is struggling with the Jat movement, has 13 seats from this region
 ye hai bade chehramayawati, kalyaan singh, general ve ke singh, ajit choudhary, jayant choudhary, sangeet som, ramvir upaadhyaay, suresh rana, jagadish singh rana, rajendra singh rana, raja mahendra aridaman singh, thakur moolchand, thakur jaiveer singh, sarvesh singh, vimala solanki, mahavir rana, aashu malik, gendaalal choudhary or pratap singh baghel
 The Rann of UP will start from here, in the first phase of the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, elections will be held in 73 assembly seats in 15 districts

 Compared to being punished in cases of rape with children, it is at the bottom of the punishment in other crimes
 jab aaropee jail main hi nahin daal rahe to bacchon kaa rape kaise rukegaa?bachapan bachaao andolanane 2014, 2015, 2016 ke neshnal krime record beuro (enciarabi) ke kul maamalon kii sankhya ke aadhaar par ye bataaya ki bacchon se jude rape ke maamle main kanvikshan rate sirf 9 pratishat he jo baaki neshnal krime ke everej se bahut hi kam he
 Prabhashay Kaur, the legal head of Bachpan Bachao Andolan, said that lowering of law conversion rate is a major reason for increasing cases against children
 ye bahut hi bhayanak he, poxo ke keson main to yah or bhi khatarnaak he
 States do not appeal against the convict despite the special law
 is report ke kuch aankade kaaphi chaunkaane vaale hai jisamen kaha gaya he ki agar ab pokso ke koi cases nahin aate hai to akele dilli main 2016 main darj hue cases ko sulajhane main 2029 tak kaa samay lagegaa
 At the same time, the report of DCPCR also says that in 85 percent cases, not even a single penny was given to Child Victim
 dilli kii victim companseshan skim ke mutabik peedit ko 3 se 5 lakh rupee milenge or agar baccha 18 saal se kam umr kaa he to madad 50 pratishat zyada kii ja sakati he
 The report says that 99 percent of the children have not received compensation
 agar kisi peedit ko companseshan mila bhi he to 50,000 rupee se kam mila he
 If a child is raped, then he gets out of the education system as well
 bahut cases main muft kanoonee madad peedit ko nahin mili he
 Even health assistance is not available
 uski future family sab khatm ho jaati he
 Commenting on such a bad condition of a special law, famous criminal lawyer Deepak Sharma said that the pendency in such a case is increasing because often the accused shows himself to be a minor at the time of the incident
 2012 main jab pokso act aayaa tha
 Special courts were also created then
 aisa lagane laga tha ki ye ek special lau he jo samaaj kii behatari ke liye he
 Even in the court a year was fixed for the fast track court, but the pending cases are becoming very much and due to lack of court monitoring, these pending cases are increasing
 supreme court ne guideline di thi kii har hoicourt main teen jajon kii cameti bane wo har ek poxo cese ko watch karenge
 a girl was raped in 2013 but by 2019, her trial was not completed

 Not a single riot happened in UP in 5 years, Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police OP Singh said that law and order in the state is working properly
 beete do se dhai varsh main upi main ek bhi sampradayik jhadap yaa dange ke maamla saamne nahin aayaa he
 This statement of DGP OP Singh came after a meeting with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath
 bataa den ki upi kii kanoon-vyavastha kii sthiti par pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne buudhvaar ko police vibhaag ke adhikariyon ke saath samiksha baithak kii
 Let us know that the leaders of opposition Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party have been continuously raising questions on the Yogi government
 somvaar ko samaajawaadee party ne yogi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki rajya sarkaar ko 'hatya pradesh' bana diya he
 The Samajwadi Party had tweeted, "the criminals in Lucknow, which have become the capital of the murder state, have no fear of the law! 22 days, 12 shootings and four murders
 aaj subah sant kabir nagar ke khalilabad main bhi yuvak ko goli markar badmaashon dwaara hatya
 Life in horror, silent police! ”on Thursday, the BSP supremo Mayawati on Thursday described the two and a half year tenure of the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh as dismal
 mayawati ne twit kar likhaa, 'uttar pradesh bhaajapa sarkaar kaa dhai saal kaa kaarykaal janhit, janakalyaan va pradesh ke pichhadepan ko dur karne ke liye vikaas ke adhiktar maamalon main niraashajanak rahaa he
 He said, "this government has proved to be a miserable failure especially in matters of crime control and law and order

 The two teenagers met to discuss this

 Congress state president Kishore Upadhyay and election strategist Prashant Kishore exited the room after a 15-minute meeting
