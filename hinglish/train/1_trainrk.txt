 After the independence of the country in 1954, the then Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru enacted such a law, known as the Special Marriage Act 1954
 iske tahat alag-alag dharm ke maanane waalon ko aapas main shaadi karne kii ijaajat di gai
 This means that if a boy is a Hindu, he can marry another religion ie Muslim or Christian girl
 isi tarah koi hindu ladki kisi duusare dharm yani muslim yaa isaai ladke se shaadi kar sakati he
 When Jawaharlal Nehru passed this law from the Indian Parliament, he faced strong opposition from the conservatives
 special marij act ke tahat hone vaali shaadi par bhi mahila or purush ko utana hi adhikaar miltaa he, jitna duusare marij hone vaali shaadi ke baad miltaa he
 As far as succession is concerned, marrying under the Hindu Marriage Act provides for succession under the Hindu Succession Act, while marrying under the Muslim Law attains succession under the Sharia Law
 yahaan par special marij act ke tahat shaadi karne par bhartiya uttaradhikaar adhinium ke tahat uttaradhikaar miltaa he
 Indian citizens can also marry foreigners under the Special Marriage Act and such marriage is considered completely legal
 special marij act ke tahat shaadi karne ke liye kisi pandit, padri, maulavee yaa granthi kii jarurat nahin he
 How is marriage done under the Special Marriage Act? To get married under the Special Marriage Act, an application has to be made in the ADM office
 umr kaa pramaan patr or is baat kaa halafanama dena hota he ki donon bina kisi dabaav ke shaadi kar rahe hai
 After this, both have physical verification and then both are called after 30 days
 is dauraan isaki soochna notice board main chaspa di jaati he
 Meanwhile, if anyone has any objections, he can come and tell
 vahiin, ek maheene baad shaadi karne vaale donon ladki or ladke ko ediem ke saamne pesh hona hota he
 After this, the marriage registers administer the oath to the witnesses and then register the marriage
 saath hi marij certificate jari kar dete hai
 There is no need for a cleric, a priest priest for this marriage
 isamen sirf teen gavaah kii jarurat padati he
 Necessary conditions for marriage The terms of marriage are mentioned under section 4 of the Special Marriage Act 1954 which is as follows 1
 ladki kii umr 18 saal or ladki kii umr 21 saal puri ho chuki ho
 2
 donon kii mental condishan acchhee ho taaki wo kanoonee taur par apni shaadi kii sahmati de saken
 3
 donon main se koi daanpaty jivan main nahin hona chahie yani agar unki pehle se shaadi ho chuki he to unka jivit jeevanasathi na ho yaa phir talaak ho gaya ho
 4
 donon kareebi rishtedaar naa ho

 Because the last date of nomination is also coming close to October 4
 harhaal sawaal he ki rajya main 2014 main sarkaar ganvaa chuki congress-ensipi kya is baar sattadhari bijepi-shivasena ko chunauti de paaengi
 congress-ncp is in the line of Congress and NCP leaders to get in the ruling bjp's court in the stampede state
 donon dalon ke kai bade netaa bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai
 It is believed that due to this the opposition may have to suffer in the elections
 kyonki congress-ensipi netaaon ke saath unke samarthak bhi bijepi main shift ho rahe hai
 In Maharashtra, Harshvardhan Patil, who was a senior Congress leader, has now joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)

 bihar main haashie par padi congress ne rajya main apane kayakalp ke liye ranneeti taiyaar kii he
 Shakti Singh Gohil, the new in-charge of Congress for Bihar, has prepared a 'plan 2019' by meeting with all the district heads of the party in the state
 pehla lakshya 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav main party kaa pradarshan behatar se behatar karnaa he
 At the same time, the party has to reach a strong position in future assembly elections in Bihar
 haalanki philhal focus 2019 par hi rakhaa jayega
 According to sources, in the recent meeting between Congress President Rahul Gandhi and RJD Supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, the things decided will also be included in the Congress plan for Bihar
 sutron ke mutabik, congress ke bihar plan kii 6 badi baaten-1
 The party has strategized by dividing the state into 39 districts
 rajya main adhiktar jo bhi jiladhyaksh hai yaa banenge, wo purv vidhayak, purv saansad yaa purv mantri nahin hai, iske chalate wo kai baar siyaasi daanvpench main kamjor pad jate hai
 Therefore, the party has decided that it will give new responsibility to 17 loyalists out of the party's 27 mlas in the state
 saath hi rajya se 22 diggaj, majboot or taqatvar netaaon kii list bhi taiyaar kii ja rahi he
 2
 jaldi hi in sabhi ko ek jila god lene ko kaha jaayegaa
 In order to strengthen the party in that district, they have to strengthen the hands of the District President
 haa, is baat kaa khyaal rakhaa jaayegaa ki vidhayak or baaki bade netaaon ko apane jile ke bajaaypados ke jile kii jimmedaaridi jaayegi, jisase aapasi khinchataan kii sambhaavna naa bade
 3
 jaldi hi party prabharee shakti singh gohil ke saath chaar prabharee sachiv bhi niyukt kiya jaayenge, jinka kaam 10 -10 jilon kii nigaraanee karnaa hoga
 Rahul Gandhi has strict instructions that everyone's accountability will also be decided after monitoring
 4
 After Rahul Gandhi and Lalu Yadav's meeting, it was decided that the Congress would focus on non-yadav obcs along with the forward castes
 darasal, lalu kaa maananaa he ki, congress us vot bank par nigaah gadaaye jo bijepi ke paale main chalaa gaya he
 The rest of the Muslim Yadavs will mobilize themselves
 isi pariprekshya main lalu ne rahul se bihar main congress pradesh adhyaksh banane kii salaah bhi di
 The Congress State President's chair has been vacant since Ashok Chaudhary left
 5
 The Congress has been out of power in Bihar for years, so the party will tell people what schemes it had brought for unemployment, farmers and all sections when it was in power and what was the state of the state then
 iske saath hi logon ko samajhaayaa jayega ki congress kaa bhavishya main kya karne kaa iraadaa he jisase bihar khushhaal ho sake
 The party will disseminate all this with a district-wise press conference
 yani congress ke vakt varshon pehle kya tha or agecongress kaa kya rodmapahoga
 6
 isi ke saath hi rahul ne jis machuaaraa congress kaa gathan kiya he, usko bihar main khaastaur vistaar diya jaayegaa
 The Congress feels that there is a significant number of this class on the banks of the Ganges in Bihar, but as of now, there are no important plans for them
 isliye party is par khaastaur se focus karegi
 Overall, along with the electoral arithmetic, efforts are being made to build the party in the state, but the question is that, for a long time, the party has become a 'B team' of RJD in Bihar and in the coming times, some ease Not gonna change
 aise main kagaji plan ko dharaatal par utaarna rahul gandhi or shakti singh gohil, donon ke liye badi chunauti hogi
 On this issue, Gohil says, 'for the future the party will leave no stone unturned in its hard work, which will get some benefit even if it is fought under the alliance in 2019, we are making our plan

 bihar sarkaar ne isaki taiyaari pehle se shuru kar di thi is vajah se wo is hode main aage dikh rahi he
 But the chaos in the programs is also coming to the fore
 mangalvaar ko mujffarpur main gandhi ji ke mujffapur main pravaas kii yaad main kaarykram yojit kiye gaye the
 In fact, from Muzaffarpur, Gandhiji went on a trip to Champaran

 The government also has a program to honor freedom fighters on the occasion

 gandhi ji kaa naam sunakar yah bujurg mahila swatantraaa senaanee samaaroh main pahunch gayi par samaaroh kii bheed main inhen sarkaar bhul gayi
 When the Chief Minister's speech was over, he was left on his hall

 Police personnel also did not assist
 100 saal ke bujurg mahila swatantraaa senaanee par kisi ko taras nahin aayaa
 If Nitish Kumar were to be seen, the elder would not have been treated like this
 lekin 18 april ko jab desh bhar ke swatantraaa senaanee patna main jutenge to unhen in baton kaa khyaal bhi rakhana hoga
 Because 70 years of independence of a country, its freedom fighters will be elderly and helpless

 ladakiyon ne bataaya ki agent ne unke passport rakh liye or unako cameraa chhodane par giraftaar hone kii dhamkee di thi
 He told that she was upset because she was kept in a room like a prisoner for 2 months and some had been kept for a month
 unka agent kabhi-kabhi shaam ko unase sharaab pikar milane aata tha magar unako baahar bhejne ke bare main kuch bhi nahin bataata tha
 Anandi narrating her story said that she came in contact with the agent through one of her sisters
 usne usko naukari dilaane ko bharosa diya or iraq main ek aadmi ko bech diya
 Her boss misbehaved with her in Iraq, after a long period of torture she somehow managed to escape from there
 bharat pahunchane par usne agent se sampark kiya or uske bare main pataa laga liya
 When Anandi came to know that the agent brought some girls from Nepal and kept them hidden in Delhi, he informed this to an organization called KI Nepal which works to stop human trafficking along the indo-nepal border
 anandi kii shikaayat par keai nepal ne ladakiyon ko bachaane ke liye dilli mahila ayog se sampark kiya

 Transformation of Yudhishthira: The emergence of the 'abhinav Pandava', a contemporary review, mainly linked Yudhishthira's mythological character to contemporary consciousness, linked contemporary problems to the roots of antiquity and extended contemporary narrative to contemporary narrative
 'mahabharat' hamaari jaateey chetana kii aisi katha he jo 'ramayana' main anusyut 'adarsh kii charam gaatha' ke barakes 'yatharth kaa nagn rup' he
 Taking the case of Ramswaroop Chaturvedi, it can be said that the entire expansion of the entire "indian ethnicity" has merged into these two ends
 '' ullekhneey he ki udbhrant kaa kavi in donon siron ke bich awajahi karata he
 He writes ‘treta’ and ‘swayamprabha’ on one side and ‘abhinav Pandava’ and ‘pragyavenu’ on the other side
 'treta' main ve jahaan us yug ke vividh stri paatro ke madhyam se katha ke bheetar utarate hai or ab tak anudghaatit kai stri-pahnon ko thik hi centrebindu main rakhte hai, vahiin 'abhinav pandav' main ve yudhisthir ke madhyam se yudhant or aparadhbodhon ko pakadaney kii koshish karte hai
 But as the name itself suggests, 'abhinav Pandava' also shows a new or, say, modern form of Yudhishthira (and perhaps the rendering of this novelty is a feature of this work) that burns in the fire of self-effacement Interviews and works for the welfare of the common man as a common citizen, battling and exiting the inner Mahabharata
 mahabharat kii prachlit katha main kinchit pherbadal karte hue udbhrant yah sangyojan karte hai ki yudhisthir ko 'do ghadi' ke liye narak main rahane ke baad ek saadhaaran manushya ke rup main mrityulok main bhej diya gaya
 This was given by Yama Raj to Yudhishthira
 ja thi
 It is noteworthy that behind the metaphor of this new legislation, the establishment of Loksatta instead of the erstwhile state
 ek shaktishaalee raja se ek aam aadmi ke rup main yudhisthir ke roopantaran ko mukhyatah punarjagran ke baad dharm or rajyasatta ke kramshah kamjor / apraasangik padate jane kii vishwavyaapee ghatana se ekmec karke dekha ja saktaa he
 Combining the last two cantos of the collection, 'yama-dharma' and 'kalki-dharma', it does not take long to realize that the erstwhile Dwaparaja 'rajasuya Yagya' is not seen as an extension of modern capitalist imperialism and is a purveyor of power or wealth
 Vying for, these trends are at the root of the Mahabharata being fought in every era
 ek saadhaaran naagarik ke rup main yudhisthir ke avataran kii kalpana ke mul main andh-upabhoktavaad kaa nakaar or saadgiyukt jeevanstyli ke nirvahan kaa sandesh bhi antarnihit he
 This 'abhinav Pandava' has significance only in fighting for the rights of the oppressed and the victims / providing them justice and saving the earth from every danger and transfer it safely to the next generation
 is kriti par tippanee karte hue shiv kumaar mishra ise jahaan 'kathakavy' or 'vichaarkavy' kehete hai, vahiin swayan rachanaakaar isaki sarg-baddheey vyavastha, 'dwapar' se 'kaliyug' (aadhunik) tak ke isamen sudeergh yug-falak kaa samaveshan, yudhisthir jaise raja-nayak (khalanaayak yaa kahen paddalit nayak ke lakshan sahit) or krishna jaise asaadhaaran charitra nayak ke charitrachitran, kalpana-yatharth ke parsparik sangufan, kathy-prastuti kii abhinavtaa evam jansamanya ke hit main vikaas kii aakanksha evam uske liye abhisht sangharsh aadi kai tatwon ke aadhaar par 'abhinav pandav' ko mahakavy kii sangya pradaan karata he
 Naresh Mehta, in his lecture at the Allahabad Museum (madhyam ahmad-june, 2001), discussed in great detail the changing form and composition of the epic
 unhone kaha tha, ''mahakavy kavy kii rachanaatmak drushti kaa naam he, swaroop kaa naam nahin
 "evolution" also emphasizes the creation of new standards of epochal epics
 ullekhneey he ki aadhunik hindi kavita ke itihaas main 'kamayani', 'urvashi' jaisi kritiyon ko sarvamaanya rup se mahakavy kii koti main aane main suchintit tark-yojanaon se guzarana padaa
 Through the work presented, the debate over the form of 'epic' and the vision behind it will be carried forward
 or tab kadachit hindi kavy main prabandhatmakataa kii thahari hui parampara aage bad sakegi or hindi kavita kaa mahakavyatmak swaroop apane samakaleen or aadhunik sandarbhon main bhi apni praasangikta va mahatta banaae rakh sakegaa

 Due to the negligence of Election Commission officials, there was re-voting in Mumbai's Malad, Charkop and Chandivali on Sunday
 jisase ek taraf log kaaphi naaraaz dikhe to duusari taraf netaa chintaa main najar aae
 On April 24, many people had gone out of Mumbai for a holiday by voting, so it was very difficult for the leaders to call back people for re-voting

 In Mumbai, about 54 percent voting was done
 lekin chunaav ayog ke adhikariyon kii galati kii vajah se uttar mumbai or uttar-madhya mumbai ke 3 poling boothon par ravivaar ko dobaaraa voting kerani paddy
 In fact, election officials in Malad, Chandivali and Charkop in Mumbai forgot to delete mock votes in the April 24 election
 jis vajah se jitne voter the unase zyada vots mashin main dikh rahe the
 Mock votes are the votes that the election officials show to the party workers by pressing the button in front of the election symbol of all the parties to show the practicality of the EVM machine running well
 or voting shuru hone se pehle ye vots dilit kar dete hai
 But the Election Commission officials at these places forgot to delete these votes
 adhikariyon kii is laaparvaai se in jagahon par dobaaraa voting kii nobet aa gayi
 The people of this constituency are in a lot of trouble, but the leaders here are seen in the most concern
 kyonki pehali baar vot kar ghoomane mumbai se baahar nikal gaye log dobaaraa voting ke liye nahin aa paae
 Resentment against the Election Commission is clearly visible among the candidates of this constituency
 pehle hi lakhon logon ke naam voting list main naa hone ke kaaran chunaav ayog ne maafee maangi he or ab is galati kii vajah se ayog ko logon ke gusse kaa bhi saamana karnaa pad rahaa he

 To this, Siddaramaiah said, 'this has also happened in the years 2004 and 2006, when JD (S) formed an alliance with Congress and BJP respectively
 'siddharmaiya ne kaha, ' isi vajah se devgauda apane ko kingmekar maanate hai
 But this time the JD (S) will be able to win 20 seats, so neither he is a king nor a kingmaker

 Siddaramaiah also denied that he was contesting from two seats Chamundeshwari and Badami for fear of losing

 Asked why this election has become a personal battle between PM Modi and him, Siddaramaiah said, 'I have never personally criticized him and he has been making false and baseless allegations against me

 ) The central government may come on the backfoot on notifications prohibiting the purchase or sale of cattle for slaughterhouses
 sutron kii maane, to centre sarkaar apane is notification ko waapas le sakati he
 Let us know that when this notification came out in May, there was a lot of ruckus on it
 sutron kii maane, to kai rajya sarkaron ke virodh ke baad ab centre sarkaar in notification par ye faisla lene ja rahi he
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was the first to protest against the notification
 jiske baad tamilnadu, kerala or karnataka ne bhi khule taur par iskaa virodh kiya tha
 According to the English newspaper Indian Express, the official said that we have sent a file about it to the Law Ministry, in which there is a matter of withdrawing this notification
 kya tha notification?darasal 23 may 2017 ko jari kiye gaye is notification main kendriya paryaavaran mantralay ne pashu krurta nivaaran adhinium -1960 ke tahat ek nayaa notification jari kiya tha
 It provided that those purchasing cattle from cattle markets would have to promise in writing that they would be used for farming and not meat
 in maweshiyon main gaay, bail, sand, bachade, bachhiya, bhens aadi shaamil hai
 Under these new rules, it was necessary to keep a written record of every cattle coming into the animal market
 iske alaava seemapar or duusare rajyon main pashuon kii hatya rokane ke liye antarrashtriya seemaa se 50 kilometre or rajyon kii seemaa se 25 kilometre ke andar pashu bazaar lagane par bhi pratibandh lagaaya gaya tha
 There was a charge of imposing Hinduist thinking, since the release of this notification, a lot of opposition was seen in various states
 kai log jahaan ise anaupchaarik meet bain qaraar de rahe the, to vahiin kuch ise saare desh par hinduvadi soch thopane kaa aarope laga rahe the
 Beef party was organized in various states of South and North East India in protest against this decision of the Center

 Since the iphone x launch, questions have started to arise about a privacy in the US
 sawaal ye he ki iphone x se fingerprint scinar yani tach idi ko ab facial ricognishan yani phase idi se riples kar diya gaya he
 This means that now you will need to show the face to unlock the iphone X, whether day or night
 company ne aisi technology lagaai he jisase andhere main bhi cheharaa scan hota he
 First of all, you have to save faceprint by scanning your face which will be done by iphone itself
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki kya har yujar kii biometric detel yani faseprint aipal ke sarwar par seve hoga? yaa sirf customers ke hi phone main rahegaa
 According to a report by Recode, American Senator Franken has raised many questions and is seeking information about the privacy and safeguards from the company
 mukhya taur par unka sawaal he ki biometric data rakhaa kahaan jayega?unka maananaa he ki aipal in nae analoking system se colect kiye gaye faseprints ko apane bijness ke phaayde ke liye duusare sectors main bech saktaa he
 Apart from this, the company can give any third party agency for monitoring
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki sarkari agenciyaan aipal se yugers ke faseprints kii maang bhi kar sakati hai
 He has written to Apple on the issue of facial recognition
 ricode ke mutabik apalane pehle se hi is tarah ke mudde par apni safai di he
 The company's Senior Vice President Phil Schiller has stated that facial recognition data will remain up to the user's iphone and will not be sent to Apple's cloud server
 is safai ke baavjood america netaa franken ke passapal ke saio tim cook se kai sawaal hai
 These questions mainly include these
 - kya aipal yaa third party ko yah akhriyaar hoga ki wo remoteli yaa mobile ko acces karke iphone x dwaara store kii jane vaale yujar faseprint data ko apane istemaal main laa sake
 - Franken has also said that it is possible that Apple later changes its decision and starts saving it remotely on its server
 agar aapako yaad ho san barnadino shunting ke baad aipal ne epabiai ko uskaa yphone analock karne se manaa kar diya tha
 The case went to court, but even then Apple was adamant about not opening the lock citing its privacy policy
 lekin baad main epabiai ne privet haikar ke yphone ko analock kara liya
 It was later revealed that the FBI has bought a special tool for this, which opened the shooter's iphone
 haalanki franken ne aipal ke is khandan ke baad ki wo biometric data kisi duusare ko nahin degaa unhone ek baar phir se is par pukhta jaankaree kii maang kii he
 It is worth noting that in India also, such debate on Aadhaar is going on continuously, because biometric details of users are being taken for Aadhaar too
 ab kahin na kahin iphone x ke saath yahi samasya he
 Currently, the company has not said anything about Franken's statement

 Despite Chhattisgarh being an integral part of the country, even today, it is not in the map of the country
 aazaadee ke pehle or baad main desh ke tamaam rajyon kii sarhad khinchi gai
 The divisions, districts, blocks, villages and towns of these states were made a map, but the government of Abujhmad in Chhattisgarh has neither a nexus nor a map
 ab pehali baar abujhmaad kaa survey ho rahaa he taaki uskaa nakshaa ban sake
 This is the part of Abujhmad area of chhattisgarh where a blueprint for this area is being drawn by drone
 yah ilaaka abhi tak desh ke liye abujh pehali bana hua he
 Since independence, there has never been a population recorded in this area nor there is any indication of government schemes
 yahan tak kii is ilaake main aam logo kii awajahi main roak he
 This prohibition is not from today but has been going on since the British rule
 yah roak sanvaidhanik he kyonki yahaan par sangrakshit janajatiyaan nivas karti hai
 The movement of common people has been banned in view of their identity and the threat of social change
 yahan daakhil hone ke liye prashasan se anumati kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The tribe living in Abujhmad is far away from the current modernization, development and western culture
 yahan par pahunchakar aadim yug kaa ehsaas hota he
 According to Kawasi Lakhma, an MLA from Bastar, Kanta, the people of Abujhmad mention Chhattisgarh's name only to show their whereabouts
 hakeekat yah he ki apni aajeevika ke liye ye adivasee puri tarah se telugana par nirbhar hai
 They cross the Indravati river and sell forest products in the village there
 ilaaj bhi vahi karaate hai
 MLA Lakhma also states that even after so many years of independence neither the state government nor the central government has been able to reach here
 udhar chhattisgarh ke rajasav mantri prem prakaash pandeya bataate he ki survey ke aadhaar par hi vikaas yojanaaye taiyaar hoti he
 At least his government deemed it serious and started the survey
 unke mutabik aazaadee ke baad se lekar ab tak abujhmaad sayukt madhyapradesh kaa hissaa rahaa
 Here the Congress government has been in power for almost 40 years but it did not even peep towards Abujhmad
 abujhmaad kii abujh pehali ko sulajhane ke liye pehali baar kisi rajya sarkaar ne yahaan survey kaa kaam shuru kiya he
 This is a part of the country that does not yet have a land record
 bharat ke naqshe main bhi abujhmaad shaamil nahin ho paaya kyonki iskaa koi map aaj tak taiyaar hi nahin hua
 For the first time after independence, census and terrain assessment is being done here
 survey ke baad abujhmaad bharat ke nakshe main dikhaai degaa haalanki yah puraa hissaa naksaliyon ke kabje main he
 The Naxals not only have large training camps here but they are also their refugees
 abujhmaad ke log puri tarah jangal main hi guzar basar karte hai
 Neither do they ever come out of this forest nor do they allow outsiders to enter their area
 inaki puri aajeevika inhen jangalon par nirbhar he
 They get all the things that are useful in daily life from food to drink
 vikaas ke naam par kuch ek gaanv main aajkal bans se nirmit vastuon kaa bhi nirmaan ho rahaa he
 The government hopes that after this survey, the situation in Abujhmad will change
 abujhmaad prakritik rup se kaaphi sampann he
 There is a dense forest in this area, but there are many species of trees in this forest which are not commonly seen
 yahaan kai tarah kii jadi butiyaa bhi paidaa hoti he
 Many traders enter here secretly for smuggling herbs and wood from the forest
 sarkari ricard main naa to aabaadi darj hone se or na hi ilaake kaa rakabaa pramanit hone ke chalate is ilaake kii vikaas kii yojanaaye taiyaar hi nahin ho pai
 After the survey, the foundation for development works will be laid in this area
 survey kaa kaam ai ai tii khadgpur kii team ke kandhon par he
 The problem is that this team has to struggle hard for the survey here
 pal-pal uskaa saamana naksaliyon se ho rahaa he
 Sometimes the flight of the drone is being stopped, sometimes the Naxalite is facing restrictions while entering the new area

 It is believed that this step will make it cheaper to take loans from these banks
 bataa den ki kendriya bank ne nitigat dar main katautee ke baad bainkon se uskaa laabh graahakon ko dene ko kaha tha, jisase dhimi padati arthvyavastha main teji laai ja sake
 Recently, the Reserve Bank of India held a monetary review meeting of 0

 With this, the new repo rate 5

 In the last two meetings of RBI also, MPC repo rate respectively 0
 25 fisadi kii katautee kar chuki he
 This means that for the third consecutive time in June, the central bank has reduced the repo rate

 The apprehensions of a fast-growing coup in Pakistan have now come to a halt at the climax like suspense of films
 jang kii tamaam bisaat bich jane ke baad fouj or sarkaar donon ke kadam thahar gaye hai or takaraav ke halaat taalte ja rahe hai
 Pakistan's President Zardari also returned to his country from Dubai on Friday morning

 He is choking in a situation of confusion
 puraa mulk jaananaa chahta he ki desh kaa bhavishya kya hoga? sarkaar or sena ke bich khinchi talavaarein baar-baar taanaashaahee ke khanjar se maare gaye mulk ko kis ore le jaaegi
 Not only the people of Pakistan, but the whole world is eagerly waiting for the answers to these questions, but at this time it is not possible for anyone to answer
 sena or sarkaar main chhidi jang kii bisaat ab bhi bichhi he
 Kiani and Geelani are still caught by swords, but neither Prime Minister Gilani nor Pak army chief Kiyani is ready to step up the check and check

 It is clear from this statement that the Pakistan Army is not in the mood for coup at the moment, but it can also be Kiyani's political move, sensing the chance of the occasion

 Overall, the government has also stopped its steps and the Pak army has also taken restraint to avoid the stigma of killing democracy, but this stagnation of confusion over the possibility of a coup in Pakistan is not a very late guest

 input- IANS Deepika Padukone is in the news about her debut at the Cannes Film Festival recently
 lekin isi ke saath unki lav life se judi ek khabar or ai he
 By the way, it is not Ranveer Singh, but Ranbir Kapoor
 deepika padukonne haal hi main bangladesh ke liye ek sabun kaa vigyaapan kiya he
 The way his picture was taken, a surprising thing has come out
 darasal, is tasviir main deepika kii gardan ke peeche bana wo tatu najar nahin aa rahaa he, jo unhone ranbir kapur ne naam par banwaaya tha
 Rattir was written in Ranbir's love, this tattoo on his neck was written in RK
 ye unhone tab banwaaya tha, jab unka or ranbir kapur kaa afaire ufaan par tha
 The two were often seen together and fully immersed in each other's love
 lekin phir ajab prem kii gajab kahani kii shooting ke dauraan ranbir kapur apni costar katrina caff ke kareeb aate chale gaye or deepika ke pyaar kii nishaani yani is RK tatu kii bhi ranbir ne kadra nahin kii
 Deepika got Ranveer's breakup with Saathbir: Deepika Padukone got her love in Ranveer Singh
 pehle ranvir kii khullam khulla pyaar vaali harkaton par sakuchaane vaali deepika baad main unke saath khulkar public main aane lageen
 Meanwhile, all the RK people had almost forgotten about this tattoo that suddenly the pictures of this advertisement reminded them again
 vaise ab jab yah tatu deepika kii gardan par najar nahin aa rahaa he to iskaa matlab saaf he ki jaisaa vah dikhaati he, unke man main kisi puraani baat ko lekar koi kadavaahat nahin he
 However, the question arises whether Deepika has removed these tattoos at the behest of Ranveer Singh? jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay (jeenyu) chaatrasangh chunaav ke liye gathit chunaav samiti or vishvavidhyalay prashasan main buudhvaar ko jubaani jang jari rahi or donon ne ek duusare par aarope-pratyarope lagaae
 The university's Dean of Students Umesh Kadam accused the students of taking them hostage
 vahiin, jeenuasu chunaav samiti ke sadasyon ne daawa kiya ki haal main hue chunaavon main kathith taur par lingadoh samiti ke dishanirdeshon kaa anupaalan nahin karne ko lekar kadam kii ore se jari saman kaa jawaab dene ve unke karyaalay gaye to unhen vahaan pravesh nahin diya gaya
 Please tell that Kadam issued notice to the members of the Election Committee run by the students on Monday and asked them to reply in the matter by 10 am on Wednesday
 kadam shikaayat nistaaran prakoshth (jiarsi) ke bhi adhyaksh hai or unhone daawa kiya ki subah das baje se dopaher dhai baje ke bich chunaav samiti ke sadsy unke karyaalay nahin aae
 When he came at half past five in the evening, we refused to accept his reply as it was time to close the office
 iske baad ve karyaalay ke get par hi baith gaye or kai ghante tak unhen bandhak banaae rakhaa
 This increased his blood pressure and he had to go to the health center when he was nervous
 unhone kaha, "yatra bhaichaare kii ahmiyat bataati he
 The arrangements made this year are causing trouble to the local residents

 On the other hand, the Governor defended the ban saying that the period of the ban has been reduced to two hours daily
 unhone kaha, "14 farvari ko rajmarg par jo hua usase aap avgat hai
 The prohibition is mandatory for the safety of pilgrims

 (input from IANS) 'sahitya ajtak 2019 ' aaj (shuukravaar) se shuru ho gaya1 november se 3 november tak chalegaa sahitya kaa mahakumbhsahitya ajtak main shaamil hongi kai mashhoor hastiyaansahitya kaa sabase bada mahakumbh 'sahitya ajtak 2019 ' aaj (shuukravaar) se shuru ho gaya he
 Writer and journalist Vijay Trivedi along with writer and journalist Ashutosh, writer and journalist Saba Naqvi participated in the 'rashtra or Hindu Rashtra' session on the 'sidhi Baat' stage of 'sahitya Aaj Tak' on the first day
 is dauraan teenon varisht patrakaron ne apni baaten bebaaki se rakhin
 The session was conducted by Aaj Tak's Executive Editor Rohit Sardana
 charchaa kii shuruyaat main teenon hi mehmaanon kii kitabon kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya
 Beginning the discussion, Rohit said, "there is no religion of the country, but despite that we are two to four whether India is a Hindu nation
" charchaa main sabase pehle varisht patrkaar ashutosh ne apni baat rakhi
 Vijay Trivedi then proceeded to discuss that there is confusion about the Hindu nation
 saavarkar ne sabase pehle hindu raashtra kaa concept diya tha
 The Union does not consider Savarkar's concept
 ashutosh jo kah rahe hai vah saavarkar kaa hindu raashtra he
 Golwalkar has said that the people who live in India are Hindus
 sarasanghachaalak ne spasht kiya he ki bina musalamaanon ke hindootv adhuraa he
 So i want to say that there is more confusion
 mind set main bada badlaav havijay trivedi ne apni baat rakhte hue aage kaha ki logon ke mind set main bada badlaav he
 Constitutionally, there is no separate here
 musalmaan or hindu donon ek saath vot dete hai lekin jo hamaara mindset he, jab is desh kii koi badi sarkaar bina kisi muslim mishan ke chalati ho jab koi ek bade rajya main vahaan kii sabase badi party kisi ko apana muslim numaayinda nahin maanati ho, to ye sab bade sawaal khadey karte hai
 But Hindus are different from this
 hindustan kaa jo hindustani he vah aaj bhi sahishnu he
 He still trusts in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam even today
 aaj yadi aisa nahin hota to yahaan dange ho rahe hote
 If riots are not happening today, there is no government or political party, it is Hindutva
 jo gandhi kaa zikr kar rahe hai wo gandhi kaa hindutv hi hamaare zyaadaatar log maanate hai
 Swami Vivekananda's Hindutva, the Supreme Court's Hindutva and the existing political system's Hindutva are causing confusion in you and that is bothering us

 Vijaya Trivedi considers opposition to the Sangh as Hindu opposition and further stated that we consider the opposition to the Sangh as Hindu opposition
 sangh main swayamsevakon kii sankhya kareeb ek karod he is desh kii aabaadi he 130 karod usamen hindu hi yadi maan len to 80 karod se zyada he
 There are only 1 crore swayamsevaks out of 80 crores and we are considering opposition to Hinduism
 isliye ham sangh ko bhi takat de rahe hai or hinduon ko apamaanit bhi kar rahe hai kyonki agar 80 karod hindu sangh ko maanate to 80 karod swayamsevak hote
 12-15 crore people must have voted for the BJP, they are not all people of the Sangh, a lot of them are not even Hindus, hence the Confusion has to be overcome to oppose the Sangh as Hindu opposition
 sangh jo he hindu vichaardhaara ko maanata hoga lekin hindu vichaardhaara sangh kii vichaardhaara nahin he isko jab tak clear nahin karenge to ye roj vivaad chalata rahegaa roj ham log is par bahes karte rahenge

 According to sources, Gurmeet Ram Rahim was unable to sleep through the night with the firecrackers and spent the whole night in restlessness

 The record of the highest number of burns was broken by how much Gurmeet Ram Rahim was fond of burning on the occasion of Diwali, it can be gauged from this that on 23 September 2016 he joined 1 with 1531 participants
 5 lakh die jala karginis world recordbhi banaaya tha
 However, this record is now recorded by the Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday on the banks of the Saryu River
 7 lakh die jala kar tod diya he
 Significantly, Gurmeet Ram Rahimdiwali used to celebrate with great enthusiasm
 vah diwali ke din khaas dress pahanakar baahar nikalataa or darjanon ladkiyaan thaal main die jalaaen uskaa swaagat karatin, lekin dharm kii aad main kiye gaye aniatik kaaryon ne na keval uski diwali hi kaali kar di, balki 20 saal tak uske jivan main bhi andhera kar diya

 Apart from this, the absconding suspect is said to have been involved in a bomb blast outside the BJP office in Bangalore in April last year and some other cases
 police ne bataaya ki andhra pradesh-tamilnadu seemaa par chitoor main ek ghar main muthbhed chal rahi he
 These people are suspected to be involved in several cases
 ghatana ke bare main puche jane par dijipi ne kaha ki vah soochna kaa intjaar kar rahe hai

 Cricketer-turned-politician and Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan (PM Imran khan) has confessed that his country had trained terrorists, but they were not jihadis
 unhone afghanistan main america sena kii maujuudagi par sawaal uthaate hue shuukravaar ko kaha ki soviet sangh dwaara afghanistan par kabza kar liye jane ke baad unke mulk ne america jasusi agencyschhiaki madad se jihadiyon ko prashikshan diya tha
 After 10 years, America arrived there, and when they could not achieve success even after a long struggle, the Mujahideen was declared a terrorist, and we are being blamed
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan (imran Khan) ne kaha, "80 ke dashak main ham in mujahidin ko soviet union ke khilaaf jehad ke liye prashikshit kar rahe the,jab unhone afghanistan par kabza kar liya tha
 
 
 So, these people have been trained by Pakistan, and the US spy agency CIA provided them with Mali help
 
 
 "unhone kaha, "iske ek dashak ke baad jab american afghanistan main aae,to ve sabhi gut,jo pakistan main hai,ve kah rahe hai ki chunki american vahaan (afghanistan main) aa gaye hai,to ab yah jehad nahin,aatankwaad bataaya ja rahaa he
 
 
 This is quite contradictory, and i think Pakistan should have remained neutral, because by joining these Mujahideen factions have turned against us
 
 
 "pak pm:the same groups who are all in Pakistan are supposed to say that now because Americans are there it is no longer jihad its terrorism
 It was a big contradiction & i strongly felt that Pakistan should have been neutral because by joining in, these groups turned against us (2 / 3) https: / / t
 co / gvjdtcxb1tpakiswana ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne kaha, "hamane bhi apane 70,000 log khoe hai,hamane apni arthvyavastha se 100 arab dollar se zyaada ganvaa die
 
 
 In the end, we were the only ones convicted for not succeeding in Afghanistan
 
 
 mujhe lagata he ki yah pakistan ke saath bahut ninsaphi he
 
 
 "pakistani PM Imran Khan: We lost 70,000 people, we lost over a 100 billion dollars to the economy
 In the end, we were blamed for the Americans not succeeding in Afghanistan
 i felt it was very unfair on Pakistan

 The accident took place in Palani at 08:30 am

 The work of removing the injured is being done
 kai ghayalon ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 At the same time, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath expressed sorrow over this incident
 unhone mritak ko do-do lakh rupee, gambhir rup se ghayalon ko 50-50 hajaar rupee or maamuli rup se ghayalon ko 25-25 hajaar rupee kii madad dene kaa elaan kiya he
 a total of six people, including the driver, were aboard this bus

 At the same time, before this, due to the dense fog in Delhi and surrounding areas, many accidents have been seen

 NCP leader Sharad Pawar is among the few players in Indian politics who understands the nuances of the power game
 satta main kaise bane rahaa jaae, bhala unase behatar yah koun jaan saktaa he? unhone hamosha sadhi hui raajnneeti kii he taaki rajasatta kaa sukh bhoga saken
 He continues to do many things to maintain his position
 kai baar apni sahyogi party ko andhere main rakhkar shivasena or yahaan tak ki manase ke netaaon se bhi milte rahe hai
 It is not that it is a wrong thing to meet or interact with the leaders of rival parties, but their style was unique and somewhat mysterious
 vah un baithkon ke jariye hameshaa kuch jataane kii koshish karte rahe hai
 That is, politics at every step! In the last days, he showed his inclination towards BJP, showing something soft towards Modi
 aisa laga ki vah kuch sanket de rahe hai
 And perhaps that's why Uddhav Thackeray had to say clearly that there is no place in the NDA for Pawar
 apni sahyogi party par dabaav banaakar pavaar ab palat gaye hai
 Now they have become loyal to the Congress
 iskaa hi nateeja he ki vah narendra modi par baras rahe hai
 He is saying that Modi should be treated in a mental hospital
 itnaa hi nahin vah bad-chadhakar congress kii prashansa kar rahe hai
 He is telling Modi about the contribution of Congress in the freedom struggle
 yani ab vah phir se apane puraane sakha ke saath ho gaye hai
 But the question arises that when Congress is such a great party, why did Sharad Pawar leave it? And why did they form their own party? Why did it become necessary for him to tell others about this one and a half year old party? As far as the farmers are concerned, what did Sharad Pawar do to save them? Farmers have committed suicide in Gujarat, but Pawar's home state Maharashtra tops it

 Along with this, Trump also cursed the previous US presidents who were soft on China
 australia ke piem scot morrison ke saath ek manch par maujuud trump ne kaha ki nishchit rup se china duniya kii shanti ke liye khatra he, ve apni takat itani teji se badha rahe hai jitani teji se duniya kii koi duusari takat nahin kar rahi he, or iske liye ve america ke paise kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Trump said that earlier US presidents allowed China to take $ 500 billion from the US
 donald trump ne kaha, "un logon ne china ko hamaari bauddhik sampada adhikaar or sampada adhikaar par kabja karne diya
 "let us know that there has been a trade war between China and America for a long time

" trump ne kaha ki ve beijing ke saath vyapaar samjhaute par tabhi dastakhat karenge jab unhen ye lagegaa ki ye america ke hit main he
 Trump has insisted that he does not think he needs any kind of trade agreement with China before next year's presidential election
 raashtrapati ne kaha ki ve china ke saath kisi tarah kaa aanshik samjhauta nahin karnaa chaahate hai, ve chaahate hai ki jab samjhauta ho to puraa ho

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has played an important role in preparing the next line of leadership in the BJP
 agar chaar saal pehle north block main vitt mantri se mulaakaat ke liye intjaar kar rahe reliance samooh ke chairman anil ambani se takaraa janaa aam baat thi, to ab vitt mantralay ke galiyaaron main kisi taqatvar udyogpati ko dekh paanaa durlabh ho gaya he—yah hindustan main kaarobaar karne ke niyamon main ek kism kaa bada baari badlaav he

 The government has made concerted efforts to increase tax compliance and bring more people into the ambit of the formal economy through Demonetization Declaration Scheme
 pratyaksh karon kii vasuuli main tej badhotaree hui he, baavjood iske ki jidipi kii growth pichley do vittiya saal main dhimi padi he
 Despite the initial upsets, India's indirect tax base has increased by more than 50% since the introduction of GST

 Although the final results of demonetisation are yet to be decided and some economists are saying that it may dent the GDP growth by 1-2 per cent, its effect is clearly reflected in the increased compliance of direct tax (especially income tax)

 bhartiya communist party ke mahasachiv atul kumaar anjaan ne maang kii ki ucchtam nyaayalay kii 2 ji spectrum maamle main notice ke baad sanchaar mantri e
 Raja should resign immediately, otherwise the Prime Minister should immediately remove him from the cabinet
 anjaan ne kaha ki jab ucchtam nyaayalay ne 2 ji spectrum prakaran main sanchaar mantri ko notice jari kar diya he to unako mantri pad se khud naitikta ke aadhaar par istipha de dena chahie
 He said that if Raja is not resigning, then Prime Minister Dr
 manmohan singh ko unhen turant apane mantrimandal se hataa dena chahie taaki sibiai jaanch main koi baadha nahin aane paye or saare tathy saamne aa sake
 Anjan said that the 2G spectrum scam is about 1
 7 lakh karod rupee kaa he or is prakaran kii sibiai jaanch kar rahi he tathaa raja kaa mantri pad par bane rahane kaa koi naitik adhikaar nahin he
 He said that many Central ministers and former Governor of Uttar Pradesh Motilal Bora resigned from their posts after their name was accepted by the Supreme Court after the hawala diary case was accepted by the Supreme Court

 The king should also leave his ministerial post immediately

 After finalizing the peace deal with Iran in Vienna, Barack Obama gave John F
 kennedy kii ek pankti ko uddhrut kiya jo bataur raashtrapati khud unke do kaarykaal par sateek baithti he
 He said, "we should not compromise for fear, but never be afraid to compromise
" '' unhone kaha ki jo cheez dabaav se hasil nahin ho saki, vah kaam dhairypurna kootneeti ne kar dikhaaya
 Shaking his voice, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Jawad Zarif also said that two years of diplomacy showed what could not be achieved with ten years of American pressure
 hamaare ganatantr diwas ke maukey par obama ke bharat daure se pehle hamane isi stambh main (india today, 29 november, 2014) kaha tha ki bhale hi ve philhal fanse hue dikh rahe hon lekin patrakarita ke mukaable itihaas unka moolyankan kahin zyada nishpaksh or saraahneey tareeke se kar sakegaa
 History is now a distant thing
 unke satat prayaas or saahas ne ek aise samjhaute ko anjaam diya he jisaki saraahna benjamin netanyahu ko chhodkar samoochee duniya kar rahi he
 His new reassuring tone is what Obama threatened to veto within the US Congress on any attempt to stall the deal
 is saptaah haalanki ham iran-america parmaanu qaraar yaa pratibandhon ko hataae jane par baat karne nahin ja rahe, jo aaj nahin to kal dekhne main aayega
 Nor are we making any argument on its impact on India because it has to be positive
 isse urja kii aarthiki ko kuch raahat milegi
 Due to this, Iran will also play a close role in the tension spread in Pakistan and Afghanistan and finally the issue of gas pipelines will also be resolved
 hamaara jor darasal ek or vyapak tathaa jatil masale par he kiru ek netaa kaise apane daur ke mahaan lakshyon ko chunata he, uski raah main khadey vaastavik or taatkaalik avarodhon se kaise nibatata he or kis tarah vah apane rajnatik sansadhano kaa istemaal karke lakshya ko hasil karata he
 For a public figure, his political resources are the same as his money for a businessman
 aap chaahe kitne hi amir kyon na hon, aapaki jeb main kharch karne laayak paise simit hote hai or isiilie acha kaarobaari vah hota he jo samajhadaari se kharch karata he
 The same thing applies to politicians as well
 bharat main apane haalia anubhavon ko ham palat kar dekhen to upie-1 ne nijeekaran jaisi sudhaarwadi maangon se bachate hue apane rajnatik sansaadhan kaa kaaphi samajhadaari bharaa istemaal kiya tha, kyonki aisa karne se uske vam sahyogi bidak jate
 Instead, he kept it in the interest of the larger purpose of the indo-us nuclear deal, where it won a grand victory
 yahi faisla use duusare kaarykaal main le jane vaala sabit hua
 Let's see what Obama has done
 unhone apane vyapak lakshyon ko kaaphi pehle hi chun liya tharu iran ke saath parmaanu vivaad kaa nibatara, cuba ke saath sambandhon kaa samanyikaran or gharelu morche par obamakare
 Once these three things were decided, they began to get their feet out of the obstacles in their path, for example, they stayed away from Iraq and Afghanistan, they kept one hand away from Ukraine's case no matter how provocative it was
 , And left North Korea in its own chosen isolation
 iskaa thodaa gaharaa vishleshan banataa he
 Ukraine is concerned with the fundamental issues and fears that NATO was formed to deal with
 america ke paas itani takat nahin bachi thi ki vah vladimir putin kii mahatvakankshaon ko kuch maddhim kar paata, lihaaja philvakt usne is masale se ek duuri bana lee or europea padosiyon ke bharose ise chhod diya
 More importantly, despite the barbaric pictures of Americans beheaded and the ISIS provocation, America held its patience
 saamaanya netaa aise uksaavon, ho-halle or lokapriy maangon ke saamne pratikriya de baithte hai
 Recall how UPA-2 pulled his feet back from the well-established relationship with Pakistan in 2013 following the beheading of an Indian soldier
 aisa nahin he ki america samaaj hamaare yahaan se koi kam dhruvikrut he
 Channels like its right wing and Fox News can be equivalent to something that is the most noisy in our imagination
 obama ne bas itnaa hi kiya ki ekaadh or bamavarshak vimaan bhej die or sari jang ko aksham irakiyon, algaav main pade syriaayiyon or ziddee kurdon ke sahare chhod diya
 Their goal was Iran, and no one understood this more quickly than Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, who made it his mission to stop it from interfering with American domestic politics
 unhone to khud ko america congress ko sambodhit karne ke liye obama kii sahmati ke bagaiyr ek nyotaa bhi mangava daalaa or america raashtrapati kii naak ke neeche apana chunaav prachaar abhiyaan shuru kiya
 The way Israel is an ally of the United States, India does not have a single ally, but imagine that if something similar happened with an Indian Prime Minister, it would have been taken as a huge national and personal insult
 lekin obama ne in chizon par apni pratikriya dekar apane rajnatik sansaadhan vyarth nahin kiye
 He made two big decisions
 ek to yah ki uttari korea par koi bhi prayaas vyarth karne se behatar he ki apane padosi cuba ke saath rishton ko saamaanya kiya jaae
 Secondly, the key to a fundamental and positive change in continuously unbalanced West Asia is to bring its greatest and stable force, Iran, under its roof
 pashchimi asia main nitigat sanak or taanaashaahee ubhaaron ke peeche adhikanshtah tel kii keemton main oochaal ek kaaran rahaa he, yah baat bauddhik halkon main bahut pehle maani ja chuki thi
 That is why Obama kept his foot firmly on the issue of shale gas at the cost of making his liberal factions angry
 yah kahana atishyokti nahin hogi ki unhone south dakota ke neeche jami shell gas ko iran ko naram karne kii kunjee ke bataur istemaal karne kaa faisla kiya
 Iran began to weaken in the face of sanctions as oil prices fell
 vahaan ab bhi mullaon kii taanaashaahee kaayam he, lekin us kshetra main maujuud kisi anya bade desh se ulat vahaan taarkikta kaa ek shashakt aagrah he or ek chuni hui sarkaar bhi he, bhale hi uski takat simit ho
 He is not any Saudi Arabia, Iraq or Syria
 iske alaava sunniyon ke iageies kaa vistaar roak paane main bhi sabase behatar sthiti main iran hi he
 In the interview that Obama gave to Tom Freedman of the New York Times after the completion of this lingering Iran deal, one line is particularly noteworthy: "you have to have the ability to see yourself that way sometimes As your enemies see you
 ''is sandarbh main antarrashtriya str par do or ghatnaon par dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 Europe attached itself and the Greek leftists were forced to accept a stringent bailout deal that would keep them in the European Union, even though domestic public opinion is against it
 yahaan rajnatik varchasv or sansaadhan ko bachaakar rakhane vaali netaa kaa naam he germany kii angela mercel, jo vijeta kii tarah ubharin or unhone europe ke netaa kaa darja hasil kar liya he
 On the other hand, Alexis Sipras of Greece, who came to power riding a wave of popularity like Arvind Kejriwal, also felt good in finally choosing the broader picture for the good of his country
 unhone janamat sangrah kaa istemaal samjhaute ko jaldi aakaar dene main kiya
 The second incident was the meeting of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in Ufa
 kai log, khaskar modi ke vafaadaar or samarthak is baat par achraj main the or unke paas iskaa koi jawaab nahin tha, kyonki unhone ummid kii thi ki ve pakistan se apni kathor chhavi ke saath pesh aaenge, na ki congressi style vaali tok-tok, fite-fite (chairman maao se maafee sahit) vaali ranneeti kii ore mud jaaenge
 This is the reason why many people in India's power establishment fell victim to the mistake and they even said that there was no mention of Kashmir
 sartaaj ajij kii ore se is par tatkaal pratikriya aa gai or ab tasviir kuch duusari dikh rahi he
 It is good that the government spokespersons have denied this and made such a point that only a joint statement between the two leaders is important and not stated
 par ek sawaal kaa jawaab milanaa abhi baaki he
 As we have explained in detail in Obama's case on Iran and Cuba and in the case of Merkel on Greece, the task of the big leader is to choose the big goals and he has to decide that in his eyes the meaning of victory What is this
 bharat-pakistan ke sandarbh main kya vahi hoga jaisaa sushamaa swaraj ne kabhi kaha tha—ek sir ke badale das sir—yaa phir jaisaa ki rajnath singh biguef se kah rahe hai—ek ke badale paanch maaro? yaa phir yah hoga ki pakistan ko samjhaute kii mej par le aayaa jaae? yah faisla narendra modi ko hi lenaa he
 If Modi is in favor of the agreement, he will have to ignore it and save political resources for big decisions
 unhen jo janadesh mila he or unki jo vichaardhaara he, vah milakar unhen aisi takat detii he jo aaj tak kisi bhartiya netaa ko naseeb nahin hui he
 They can, by tackling the biggest challenges of Indian foreign policy, stand in the ranks of right-wing peacekeepers like Ronald Reagan and Menashem Begin
 yaa phir kuch nahin to ve apane dost baraak kii kitaab se hi ek sabak sikh sakate hai
 So far the people of the country are hearing from PM Modi that by 2022 all the poor will have their own house
 sabhi ke sir ke upar apni chat hogi
 But no one was aware of how it would be, how big it would be and how many facilities would be equipped
 uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar ne pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat do model gharon kaa udghaatan kiya he
 Which will be the home of the poor in the coming years
 lakhanu ke jiamu ilaake main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne do aise model gharon kaa udghaatan kiya jo aane vaale vakt menmodi sarkaar kisbase badi pahchaan hoga
 The model house, built in about 27 square meters, will be a one-room flat
 jisamen bedroom, drawing room, dining room ek saath honge or ek khulaa kichan hoga
 There will be a washroom attached to the house while there will be a balcony in the back and a toilet in the same balcony
 yah model ghar jab apane astitv main aayega to yah chaar manjila hoga
 In Lucknow, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday inspected the model house built under the Prime Minister Housing Scheme in Jiamau
 jisamen do model house taiyaar kiye gaye
 One was built by the Lucknow Development Authority and the other by the Urban Development Agency
 media se puche jane par mukhyamantri yogi ne rajya nagareey vikaas abhikaran model ko acha bataaya he
 So while walking there, it also said that 4 lakh houses will be built and these will be increased further
 philhal ghar kaa model to ban gaya lekin garibon ko kis tareeke se chinhit kiya jayega or kise yah ghar diya jayega is parfaisla honaabaki he
 According to the Yogi government, work will soon begin on building two lakh houses

 When he was asked at the event why there is so much controversy over his name? So know what a funny answer Micah Singh gave
 mika singh ne kaha- ye upar vaale kii badi krupa he ki controvarsi chalati rahati hai

 2015 main ek live event ke dauraan mika ne gusse main aakar ek doctor ko thappad maar diya tha
 a hit and run case was registered against Micaake in 2014
 unpar custom chori kaa aarope bhi lag chukaa he

 Kashmir is locked
 kashmir kii koi khabar nahin he
 The rest of India is celebrating Kashmir
 shesh bharat ko kashmir kii khabar se matlab nahin he
 The door of one has been closed
 ek ne daravaaza band kar liya he
 The Reorganization Bill of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh is presented
 zaahir he yah mahatvapurn he or aitihaasik bhi
 Appears in the Rajya Sabha and no time is given for consideration
 jaise kashmir band he vaise sansad bhi band thi
 But the Congress had done so, so everyone breathed a sigh of relief
 congress ne bijepi par bahut ahsaan kiya he
 Drums are drowning on the road
 kisi ko pataa nahin kya hua he, kaise hua he or kyon hua he
 Just a line address that has been known for years
 raashtrapati rajyapal kii sahmati bataate hai
 The governor is saying till two days ago that i do not know anything
 kal kya hoga pataa nahin
 The Governor is the representative of the Center
 raashtrapati ne centre kii raay ko rajya kii raay bataa diya

 What is there and why does not make sense
 yah hataa he ise lekar jashn he
 Two of its provisions have been lifted and one is left
 wo bhi hat saktaa he magar ab uskaa matlab nahin he
 One thing is clear among the celebrators
 unhen ab sansadeey prakriyaaon kii niyamavaliyon main koi aasthaa nahin
 They neither care about the judiciary nor the executive nor the legislatures
 sansthaaon kii chintaa kaa sawaal mrit ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he
 People have attained immortality
 yah andhera nahin he
 It is very bright
 sunai zyaada detaa he, dikhaai kam detaa he
 Lok has rejected democracy
 pareshaan hone kii zarurat nahin he
 People have found an enemy among themselves
 kabhi wo musalmaan ho jaataa he kabhi kashmiri ho jaataa he
 People have been programmed with many codes of hate
 unhen bas isse sambandhit shabd dikh janaa chahie unki pratikriya samaan rup se chhalak aati he
 Everyone has done politics with regard to Article 370
 bijepi se pehle congress ne durupyog kiya
 Won the will during Section 370
 use nishprabhavi kiya
 Political parties of the state were also involved in this game
 yaa phir unki naakaamiyon ko dhara 370 kii naakaami bataa diya gaya
 The problem of Kashmir was drastically wrapped up and hung
 usamen bahut se ghapale bijepi ke aane se pehle hue
 BJP also did politics but openly said that they will remove and remove it
 35-A to hataa hi diya
 But when did they say that if we remove Article 370, then only the states will abolish it? This question is but for whom it is not meant by it
 notebandi ke samay kaha gaya tha ki aatank kii qamar tut jaaegi
 Not broken ummid he is baar kashmir ke halaat saamaanya honge
 Now there is no question of talking to the people there
 sabake liye ek naap kaa sweater buna gaya he
 Will have to wear
 rajya kaa faisalaa ho gaya
 The state does not know
 kashmiri panditon kii hatya or visthaapan kaa dansh aaj bhi chubh rahaa he
 No one knows what is the plan for his return
 aap yah nahin kah sakate ki koi plan nahin he kyonki kisi ko kuch nahin pataa
 This is the question that makes everyone speechless
 kashmiri pandit kush hai
 Thousands of Kashmiri Pandits still live in the valley
 badi sankhya main sikh rahete hai
 How do they live and what is the experience, they have no story in the discussion of Kashmir
 ham log nahin jaanate hai
 Amit Shah gave Article 370 the reason for every problem of Kashmir
 garibi se lekar bhrashtachar tak kaa kaaran
 Told of terror
 rojgaar milegaa
 The factory will arrive
 aisa lag rahaa he 1990 kaa aarthik udaarikaran lagu ho rahaa he
 In this sense there is a lot of unemployment in UP
 ab use rojgaar or factry ke naam par paanch centre shasit pradesh main koi na baant de !ek asthaayee praavdhaan hataa kar doosraa asthaayee praavdhaan laayaa gaya he
 Amit Shah has said that if the situation is normal then he will make the state again
 yani hameshaa ke liye donon centre shasit pradesh nahin bane hai
 It is not clear that when the conditions are normal, all three will be brought back to the previous position or only the state of Jammu and Kashmir will be formed
 abhi halaat hi aise kya the ki rajya kaa darja hi samaapt kar diya
 It is expected that the duration of curfew in Kashmir should not be long
 halaat saamaanya hon
 People of Kashmir have lost their contact
 jo kashmir se baahar hai ve apane gharon se sampark nahin kar paa rahe hai
 In this situation, the congregation of celebrators is telling what we have been
 ek bheed he jo maang kar rahi he ki aap swaagat kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 The BJP itself is adjusting to Janata Dal United opposing Article 370
 virodh ke baad bhi uske saath sarkaar main he
 If you raise questions on the process, then the gang of abusers will break
 vahaan bihar main bijepi mantri pad kaa sukh bhogati rahegi
 It is a pleasure to buy land in Kashmir
 duusare rajyon se bhi aise praavdhaan hataane kii kushi manaane kii maang kerani chahie
 In those tribal areas where there is a ban to buy land under the Fifth Schedule, the slogan may be that India will not be one until it is removed
 to kya ek bharat kii maang karne vaale apane is naare ko lekar purvottar ke rajyon main bhi jaaenge yaa phir kashmir tak hi simit rahenge?tareeqa to acha nahin tha, dua kiijie nateeja acha ho
 But if the intention is not right then how can the result be good
 kashmir ko isaki kaaphi qeemat chukaani pad rahi thi
 Perhaps Kashmir will not have to share half the incomplete information of the rest of India
 kya aisa hoga? kisi ko kuch pataa nahin he
 The Kashmiri people should be worried
 unhen gale lagane kaa samay he
 You are public aapke bich se koi massej bhej rahaa he ki unki bahu betiyon ke saath kya karenge
 If you are really honest about your celebration, then how can you have a great celebration with people of this mindset? People are very big at celebrating
 unke paas bahut se jhooth or bahut si ninsafiyon se munh pher lene kaa saahas he
 Logic and fact are not important
 haan or naa zaruri he
 Say what people want to hear
 kai logon ne yah nek salaah di he
 Kashmir can trigger crowd programming so it was advised to remain silent
 itihaas ban rahaa he
 a factory is open
 usamen kab koun sa itihaas ban kar baahar aa jaae kisi ko pataa nahin chalata he
 Where history is made, there is silence
 jahaan jashn he vahaan pehle ke kisi itihaas se matlab nahin he
 When it makes sense, we make history according to our own
 sadan main amit shah ne kaha ki nehru kashmir handle kar rahe the
 Not Sardar Patel
 yah itihaas nahin he
 But now history will be done as Amit Shah has said
 unase bada koi itihaaskaar nahin he
 Note- Tell the makers of Kashmir that Kashmir is a serious issue
 pension kaa masalaa nahin he
 There is no difference between those who send more obscene messages
 donon ko kashmir ke logon se matlab nahin he
 If Article 370 made by Nehruji can be removed, then why not NPS imposed by Vajpayee ji
 waapas liye jaaenge agast se 10 oktober ke bich kaate gaye chaalaanayah saaf nahin ki jurmaane ke taur par vasule gaye paison kaa kya hogaado vibhaagon ke chakkar main trephic police ko badalanaa padaa faislado vibhaagon ke pech main fansi dilli trephic police ab kareeb dedh lakh chaalaan waapas lene kaa faisla kar sakati he
 All these challans pertain to vehicles running on National Highway No-24 (now 9) at speeds exceeding the prescribed speed limit, which were cut between August and October 10
 haalanki yah saaf nahin ho sakaa he ki in chaalaan ke kaaran aae paison kaa kya hoga
 An officer of the level of Joint Commissioner in Delhi Traffic Police, on the condition of anonymity, told that Delhi Traffic Police is withdrawing about one and a half lakh challans
 ye chaalaan kareeb dhai maheene (agast se oktober 10 tak) ke bich kaate gaye hai
 Most of the challans in these challans are related to running vehicles on the national highway at a higher speed (more than 60 km / h)
 zyaadaatar chaalaan over-speeding kedilli trephic polisake hi ek anya adhikari ke mutabik, vastav main waapas liye jane vaale ye chaalaan rashtriya rajmarg sankhya 24 (ab 9) par nizamuddin pul se gajipur sthit dilli-upi (gajiabad) seemaa par aate-jate vaahanon ke kaate gaye hai
 Most of the invoices are over-speeding
 trephic police ko kyon lenaa padaa faisla?aakhir dilli trephic police ko ab in chaalaanon ko waapas lene ko majaboor kyon hona padaa? dilli trephic police ke ek adhikari ne kaha ki darasal nirdhaarit gati se upar yani 60 kilometre prati ghanta kii gati se upar jo vaahan haive par hamaare camaron ne pakade, un sabko i-chaalaan bheje ja rahe the
 Later complaints started coming in that the PWD department had put 70 km per hour sign board on the highway
 dilli trephic police ke isi aalaa-afasar ke anusaar, trephic police kaaphi samay se peedblyoody se kah rahi thi ki vah sinboard badal de
 It means changing the already installed sign board to a maximum speed of 70 kilometers per hour to the prescribed speed limit of 60 kilometers per hour, but even after a lot of efforts, when the sign boards were not changed, the Delhi Traffic Police returned about 1
5 lakh challans in public interest
 Planned to take
 saath hi dilli trephic police ke un camaron main bhi ab 70 kilometre prati ghanta kii adhiktam gati seemaa feed kar di gai he, jo rashtriya rajmarg par aane-jane vaale vaahanon kii gati darj karte hai
 e-challan to be removed from website An official of the DCP level of the Delhi Traffic Police said that the traffic police will remove the drivers whose e-challans have been cut from their website
 lekin trephic police ke is kadam se sawaal yah uthta he ki ab tak jo log karodon rupee ke 'online' chaalaan kii rakam dilli trephic police ke jariye dilli sarkaar ko jamaa kar chuke hai, uski vaapasi kaise hogi? dilli trephic police ke kisi bhi aalaa-afasar ke is sawaal kaa makul jabaab nahin he
 Decision taken for fear of getting caught in the legal screw? On the other hand, with this incredible step taken by Delhi Traffic Police, sources say that the traffic police has not taken the decision to suddenly withdraw one and a half lakh challans
 trephic police ko kahin se bhanak lag chuki thi ki yah mudda kuch vaahan chaalak janhit yachika ke rup main hoi court ke saamne lekar pahunchane kii taiyaari main hai
 As soon as he was seen legally getting his neck stuck in front of the traffic police, he hurriedly took care of the public interest and decided to withdraw one and a half lakh challans without wasting time
 laal batti jump karne waalon or vaahan gati seemaa kanoon kii dhajjiyaan udaane waalon se nipatane ke liye dilli trephic police ne pichley dinon kareeb 24 nae camere rashtriya rajdhani main lagaae hai
 These cameras have been installed at Jawaharlal Nehru University, ISBT, Nelson Mandela Marg, August Kranti Marg, bhalswa-wazirabad Road, delhi-noida-delhi Flyway, GT Karnal Road
 duusari ore, aankade bataate hai ki kendriya sadak parivahan mantralay ne jabase (2017 se) i-chaalaanep viksit karaayaa he, tab se ise 17 rajya amal main laa rahe hai
 Through this e-challan app developed by NIC, revenue of about two thousand three hundred crore rupees in the country has been collected / deposited only by those who violate traffic rules

 The country's largest investigative agency CBI is going to close the disproportionate assets case against Mulayam Singh Yadav
 vah july ke ant tak supreme court main closer report dene kii baat kar rahi he
 It is believed that it is a matter of taking one hand and the other hand between the government and Mulayam
 sarkaar ko food bill par mulaayam kaa samarthan chahie
 Mulayam Singh Yadav is currently required for the Congress
 2014 kii chunavi bisaat kii ahm baaji unke haath se tay honi he
 Is this why the CBI is thinking of closing the case against him
 yah sawaal isliye ki yah chauthaa mauka he, jab sibiai ne mulaayam ko lekar palati maari he
 In 2007, the CBI first talked about a case against Mulayam
 - 1 march 2007 ko supreme court ne sibiai se kaha ki vah mulaayam ke khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle kii jaanch kare
 - On 26 October 2007, the CBI told the Supreme Court that a prima facie case is made against Mulayam
 isliye use exiaar darj karne kii ijaajat di jaae
 However, only a year later, the CBI changed its stand with the first reversal
 usne sidhe−sidhe sarkari dabaav kii baat maan lee
 - On 6 December 2008, the CBI told the court that the Central Government has asked it to withdraw the primary report
 - 10 farvari 2009 ko supreme court ne is maamle main apana faisla surakshit rakhaa This was the period when Mulayam helped the central government to gain the confidence
 magar march aate−aate sibiai ne duusari palati maari
 On 30 March 2009, he stated that he stood by his original position
 lekin, pichley teen saal centre sarkaar or mulaayam ke bich raajnneetik majaburiyon vaali dosti ke saal rahe hai
 That is why the CBI has to retaliate for the third time
 is baar uskaa tark he, mulaayam or akhilesh kii aay main hui badhotaree karj ke kaaran dikh rahi he
 Interestingly, according to the CBI, this loan was given to him by his relatives as gifts
 tippaniyan However, the petitioner Vishwanath Chaturvedi says that his testimony has not yet been done
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar yah maamla isliye bhi band karana chaahati he ki use khaadya suraksha bill par mulaayam kaa samarthan chahie
 It is also interesting that in this case which has been going on for seven years, no FIR has been filed yet
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah sarkaar or mulaayam ke bich ek haath le duusare haath de kaa maamla he
 The government needs Mulayam's support on the food bill
 mulaayam singh yadav philhal congress ke liye jaruri hai
 The important bet of the 2014 election board is to be decided by his hand
 kya isiilie sibiai unke khilaaf chal rahaa cese band karne kii soch rahi he
 This question is because this is the fourth time when the CBI has overturned Mulayam
 sabase pehle 2007 main sibiai ne mulaayam ke khilaaf maamla banane kii baat kahi
 - On 1 March 2007, the Supreme Court asked the CBI to investigate the disproportionate assets case against Mulayam
 - 26 oktober 2007 ko sibiai ne supreme court ko bataaya ki mulaayam ke khilaaf pehali najar main maamla banataa he
 Therefore, he should be allowed to register an FIR
 lekin, salbhar baad hi sibiai ne pehali palati maarthe hue apana rukh badal liya
 He directly acceded to government pressure
 - 6 disambar 2008 ko sibiai ne adaalat ko bataaya ki centre sarkaar ne use praathmik report waapas lene ko kaha he
 - On 10 February 2009, the Supreme Court reserved its decision in this case ye vah daur tha jab centre sarkaar ko mulaayam ne vishwasamat hasil karne main madad kii thi
 But as the march progressed, the CBI took another turn
 30 march 2009 ko usne kaha ki vah apane mul rukh par kaayam he
 But, the last three years have been years of political forced friendship between the central government and Mulayam
 isliye sibiai ko teesri baar palati maarani pad rahi he
 This time, he argues, the increase in income of Mulayam and Akhilesh is visible due to debt
 dilachasp yah he ki sibiai ke mutabik yah karj unke rishtedaaron ne tohfe ke taur par unhen die
 The comments lekin, yachikakarta vishwanath chaturvedi kaa kahana he ki abhi to uski gavaahi tak nahin hui he
 It is believed that the government also wants to close the matter because it needs Mulayam's support on the food security bill

 Asking the question of an IAS officer to the BJP government of Chhattisgarh 6
 5 karod rupye kaa pad gaya
 Actually, this officer had questioned on his Facebook wall who is Deendayal Upadhyay and what has been his contribution towards the country
 is sawaal kaa jawaab dene kii jagah rajya sarkaar ne dinadayal upaadhyaay par pustak hi chhapava di
 Shiv Anant Tayal, a 2012 batch IAS officer of Chhattisgarh cadre, posted this question in his Facebook wall about four months ago
 rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ko ye nagavar gujara
 Tayal was then posted as CEO of Kanker Zilla Panchayat
 unhen vahaan se transfar kar mantralay main atech kar diya gaya
 Four months after this incident, now a 10,971-page book written on Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya is going to give a fillip to the gram panchayats soon
 rajya ke panchayat vibhaag ne pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay kii jeevanstyli charitra or vichaardhaara par aadhaarit pandrah khando kii kitaab prakashit karne ke liye sarkari khajaane se saadhe chha karod kii rakam kharch kar di gai
 There was such haste in getting the book published that neither tender was called nor public information was issued for it
 ab ye kitaaben rajya kii sabhi gram panchayaton tak pahunchaai jaaegi
 The Congress has put the state government in the dock, alleging corruption in publishing this book
 rajya main party ke upaadhyaksh ramesh varlyani ke mutabik kitaab ke prakaashan main baari gadabadi hui he
 Verlani says- 'if there is so much emphasis on Digital India, then by giving the form of an e-book, this book could be delivered from village to village
 aisa nahin kar sarkaar ne kitaab ke prakaashan kaa kaam adhikariyon ke bharose chhod diya
 The officials who misused public money without calling tenders, should be recovered from them
 'bataa den ki rajya sarkaar deen dayaal upaadhyaay par sirf kitaab ko lekar hi nahin balki unki jayanti par hone vaale kharch ko lekar bhi sawaalon ke ghere main he
 An estimated amount of Rs 13 crore to be held on the birth anniversary celebrations will also be spent from the basic development funds of the panchayats
 haalanki panyaayat act main saaf he ki panchayat kii moolbhoot raashi ko sirf vikaas yojanaon par hi kharch kiya ja saktaa he kisi mahapurush ke naam par nahin
 The state government spent a sum of six and a half crores from the fund of the Development Fund of Panchayats to get the book published based on Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya
 maamle ke khulaase ke ab sarkaar kii ore se safai di ja rahi he
 Government spokesman Srichand Sundrani says that our aim is that we should inform the people of the country and state about the views of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, if there is any irregularity then definitely action will be taken as per rules
 chhattisgarh main yun toraman singh sarkaarka daawa he ki wo bhrashtachar ko lekar jiro tolerance kii niti apanaati he
 But neither the department head nor the minister is ready to speak about the rule process of publishing this book
 rajya main 50 hajaar rupaye se adhik ke kisi bhi tarah ke kharch yaa phir kharid farokht ke liye tender jari karne kaa niyam he
 Then in this case, the order of publication of the book was issued from the back door
 ye bada sawaal he jis par rajya sarkaar ne chuppi saadh rakhi he

 desh ke sabase bade scientific institute 'council of scientific and industrial research' (siesaiaar) 92 yuva vaigyanikon ko sadak par laa diya he
 These students, educated from good engineering colleges, are now going round the CSIR and Ministry of Science and Technology, but there is no hearing anywhere
 yahaan tak ki nikaale gaye sabhi log mantri dow
 Also met Harshvardhan

 In the petition, he has said that he was promised a scientific job in CSIR on completion of training
 is vaade ko puraa kiya janaa chahie
 Let us tell you that in August 2012, CSIR selected these 92 prospective scientists by conducting a national level test
 inhen siesaiaar ke training or em tech program ke liye chunaa gaya tha
 The entire program was two years old
 siesaiaar ne tab notification main kaha tha ki in students ko inaki training or em tech puraa hone par bataur scientist niyukt kiya jayega
 Not only this, they were also given a pay scale as per the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission
 zyaadaatar chaatr ne apane course ko achche numberon ke saath paas kiya, lekin ab siesaiaar apane vaade se peeche hat rahaa he
 These students have neither been getting salary nor being given a job for the last nearly seven months
 nikaale gaye chaatro kaa kahana he ki lakhon ke package or acchhee pojishan chhodkar siesai main aae the or ab unke saath yah saluk hua he
 Sources say that the reason for the removal of these people is due to differences between former Science and Technology Minister Jaipal Reddy and former Director General of CSIR Sameer Brahmachari and hence the matter of giving jobs to these people got hanged

 The scene of morning prayer on 6 November at the school at Payal village in Pauri district of Uttarakhand was unique: two students and a teacher
 yah baangi he sarkari skulon ke halaat kii
 The continuously declining student numbers in rural areas of Kumaon and Garhwal, both divisions of the state, have brought about 2,430 government primary schools to the brink of closure
 rajya banane ke baad se ab tak sarkari praathmik skulon main chaatr ghatakar 50 fisad se kam rah gaye hai
 Education Minister Arvind Pandey has issued an order to merge schools with ten or fewer students to the nearest schools and the department is working to outline its adherence
 rajya ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ke saath shikshak sanghathanon kii baithak main bhi praathmik or ucch praathmik vidyalayon main ghatati chaatr sankhya kaa mudda uthaa
 After this Rawat instructed to merge primary and upper primary schools with less students into the nearest school
 uttarakhand main 15,428 praathmik vidhyalay hai
 These include more than 5,56,000 students studying in government primary schools
 jabaki sarkari sahaayta praapt vidyalayon ke bacchon kii sankhya jodgaye par yah sankhya 10,50,000 zyada pahunch jaati he
 Both the divisions have 2,430 primary schools with less than 10 children
 gadhwal mandal main hi das se kam bacchon vaale skulon kii sankhya 1,365 hai
 While the number of such schools in Kumaon division is about 1,065
 pandey ne kam chaatr sankhya vaale vidyalayon ko band karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 The primary schools which will be closed will be accommodated in the schools in the nearby villages
 isse pehle tatkaaleen shiksha mantri mantri prasad naithani ne bhi apane kaarykaal main aisi hi ghoshnaa kii thi
 Which could not be implemented
 gadhwal mandal main praarambhik shiksha vibhaag ke apper shiksha nideshak es
 P
 khaali kaa kahana he ki akele gadhwal mandal ke paanchon pahari jilon ke saath dehradun, haridwar ko bhi milakar 1,365 praathmik skool aise hai jahaan chaatr sankhya das se kam he
 The worst situation is in Pauri, where 540 government primary schools are in crisis, while there are 304 schools in Tehri where the number of students is less than ten
 chamoli ke bhi yahi haal hai
 The number of students in government primary and upper primary schools is declining every year
 khaali ke anusaar chaatro kii ghatati sankhya kii samiksha ho rahi he
 By the end of November it will be decided how many of these schools should be closed
 bina chaatro vaale skulon main taale lag gaye hai
 But on the other hand, efforts are also being made to make schools smart and in the schools which have been made smart, students are increasing, according to Khali, teachers are also campaigning to increase the number of students
 isse bhi kuch had tak chaatr sankhya main sudhaar hone kii aashaa he
 By the way, the main reason for decreasing student numbers is migration from villages
 gadhwal main pahaad par log yaa to kotdwar yaa phir dehradun or uske aas-paas basane kifiraq main hai
 This situation has been created by the exodus of most of the population
 kai jagahon par mata-pita bacchon ko nijee skulon main padhaa rahe hai isliye sarkari skool khaali ho rahe hai
 But smart schooling can control situations
 shashan ne das yaa isse kam chaatr sankhya vaale vidyalayon ko artii maanak ke mutabik, ek kilometre kii duuri ke antargat praathmik vidhyalay uplabdh hone kii dasha main hi villin karne ke aadesh die hai
 The government has asked the directorate to identify such schools before the merger action
 uttarakhand main praathmik shiksha kii badahaali kaa andaja is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki ek ore jahaan padhgaye vaale bacchon kii sankhya ghat rahi he, vahiin duusari ore kai jagahon par bahut kam chaatr sankhya par do se zyada adhyaaapak hai
 There are 77 schools in the state, where more than two teachers are deployed for less than 20 students
 artii 2009 ke maanakon ke mutabik, praathmik skulon main 60 tak chaatr sankhya vaale skulon main do shikshak rakhe jate hai, 61 se 90 tak kii sankhya par teen, 91 se 120 tak par chaar, 121 se 150 par paanch or isse adhik chaatr sankhya par adhik shikshak tainaat karne kaa praavdhaan he
 Officials argue that the student-teacher ratio is getting affected every year due to promotion, transfer, retirement etc
 of teachers working in these schools
 rajya gathan ke 17 saal hone par tulanaatmak rup se shiksha par kharch to badha par gunvattta ghatati chali gai
 Spending on education in 2001 6

 Was now Rs 61 billion
 tak pahunch chukaa he
 The number of children in primary education has come down by fifty percent
 itnaa hi nahin, ucch praathmik str par bhi bacchon kii sankhya 67,000 tak kam ho chuki he
 This is because parents who are frustrated with the results of government schools prefer to send children to private schools
 nai tehri or paudi main sarkari skulon main lagaataar taale lagate ja rahe hai
 The district has closed 18 schools in the last academic session
 jile main chaatr sankhya shunya hone se 73 skool ab tak band ho chuke hai
 There are ten or fewer students in 479 schools
 inamen se 152 skulon main to vidhyaarthiyon kii sankhya ek se paanch tak simat gai he
 The number of government primary schools with zero student numbers in Pauri has increased to 229
 tehri main 1,473 praathmik skool sanchalit the, par 38 pichley shiksha satr se band ho chuke hai
 273 primary schools in Tehri are on the verge of closure due to less than 10 students
 2014 main ai anual states of ajukeshan report ke aankade is badahaali kii tasdik karte hai
 According to the report, about 42 percent of children in Uttarakhand's government schools up to class eight are unable to read words properly
 chhathin, saatvin, or aathvin ke bachche saamaanya jod-ghataana or guna-bhaag tak karne main sakasham nahin hai
 Many schools in the hilly areas are running on the strength of single teachers
 tees fisadi scalon main shauchalay nahin hai or 56 fisadi main ladakiyon ke liye alag shauchalay nahin he
 30 percent do not even have drinking water system
 junglee jaanwaron ke aatank se jujh rahe parvatiy kshetra ke 54 fisadi skulon main suraksha kii drushti se charadivari nahin he
 The library is in only 37 percent of schools
 yahi kaaran he ki sarkari shiksha par aamajan kaa bharosa behaal nahin ho paa rahaa he
 In Kumaon division, the buildings of many schools are also dilapidated
 almoda main 12, bageshwar main 62, nainital main 37, pithauragarh main chah, champavat main 21 or udhamsingh nagar main 52 madhyamik vidhyalay bhawan jarjar hai
 On November 26 last year, the High Court issued a guideline to improve the condition of primary education
 jisamen sabhi skulon main pani kaa intjaam karne, mid de mile kaa bhojan dene, shauchalay banane jaise nirdesh die the
 On non-compliance, petitioner Deepak Rana again filed an application
 is par adaalat ne june main shiksha sachiv ko talab kiya
 Despite this, there was no change

 input language bharat main Xiaomi kii Redmi 6 series ko launch hue saat maheene se adhik kaa samay biit chukaa he
 Now smartphones with Waterdrop Notch and Gradient Finish are becoming popular, due to this, counterpart companies are doing a lot of work on their new smartphones
 sirf Xiaomi hi ek maatr aisi company nahin he jo kam keemat main behatar spacification or fitures vaale smartphone ke liye market main lard rahi he
 Samsung's new A-series and M-series also give tough competition in the low price
 launch ke baad se samsung kii nai series kii bikri kaaphi acchhee rahi he
 Xiaomi has now launched a new smartphone in the price segment of less than Rs 8,000
 Xiaomi Redmi 7 ek ol-rounder smartphone he jo har kisi ko pasand aa saktaa he
 It has everything that the customer needs
 mazedaar baat to yah he ki Xiaomi ne iske companian model Redmi 7 Pro yaa Redmi 7A ko abhi tak launch nahin kiya he
 In this review, we have focused on the Redmi 7, let us know whether this phone of the Xiaomi brand is ahead of the smartphones of Samsung, Honor, Realme and other rival companies? Look at the older smartphone of Xiaomi It used to look similar but Redmi 7 has been introduced in the market with a new design
 redmy 7 main shaomi ne redmy 6 main die metalik luk kaa istemaal nahin kiya he
 Relying on the trend these days, multi-color glossy plastic has been reposed
 Redmi 7 ke teen color verient hai- iklips blike, lunar red or comet blue

 embed-container iframe, 
 embed-container object,
 embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } We have Eclipse Black color variant for review
 bataa den ki lunar red or comet blue donon hi smartphone gradient rier panel ke saath aate hai, Xiaomi ne ise ora smoke dizine kaa naam diya he
 The back of the comet blue variant has a gradient finish of dark purple and bright blue
 duusari ore lunar red verient main back panel kaa upree hissaa blike or nichalaa hissaa red color main he
 If you do not like the gradient finish given in both these variants then you can use the dark translucent plastic cover that comes in the retail box
 aajkal smartphone ko bade disple panel ke saath utaara ja rahaa he or isamen Redmi 7 kaa naam bhi shaamil he
 Remember that 5 in Redmi 6
 45 inch kaa disple tha to vahiin ab redmy 7 ko 6
 Has been launched with a 26-inch screen
 sabhi diemension main redmy 6 kii tulana main Redmi 7 ek bada smartphone he or vazandaar bhi
 Redmi 7 weighs 180 grams and thickness 8
 47 millimetre he, phone ko jeb main daalane ke baad chalane par aapako baaripan kaa ehsaas hoga
 It is not easy to reach every edge of the screen with just the thumb of the hand
 kam keemat vaala Redmi 7 mordan 'dot' noch ke saath aata he lekin agar aap bina bezal vaale phone ko dhund rahe hai to yah aapke ummid ke hisaab se feet nahin hota he
 The good thing is that Xiaomi has used Corning Gorilla Glass 5 in Redmi 7
 phone kaa back panel molded plastic se bana he jise naino-spray se finnish kiya gaya he
 The unit we have for review is glossy and more reflective
 phone ko retail box se baahar nikaalane ke kuch hi palon main isapar ungaliyon ke nishaan or dhabbe pad gaye the
 We notice that dust and small particles of fiber stick on the back of the phone, so it is impossible to keep Redmi 7 as new
 ek saptaah se bhi kam samay tak saavdhaanee se smartphone ko istemaal karne ke baad hamane phone par scrtch ke nishaan dekhe
 The Glossy rear panel comes in an edge made of matte plastic frame but is not completely smooth
 phone ke pichley hisse par diya fingerprint sensor or dahini ore die power or wolum batan tak haath aasaani se pahunch jate hai
 The thin earpiece is placed just above the front camera and the sensors are hidden
 phone ke nichle border par ek choti elidi lite di gai he jo phone ke charging hone par jalati he or bydaree phul hone par band ho jaati he
 The dual-camera module on the back panel looks a little small
 phone ke upree hisse main aapako 3
 a 5mm headphone jack and an infrared emitter will be available to control the appliances
 phone ke baayin ore upar kii taraf single trey he jisamen do naino-sim or microesady card ko lagaaya ja saktaa he jo ki kaaphi acchhee baat he
 There are two grills at the bottom of the phone but one of them is the speaker
 yuasabi tip-si port hota to acha tha
 But given the price, there is no complaint with the micro-usb port
 agar aapako bade smartphone pasand aate hai to aapako redmy 6 kii tulana main redmy 7 (redmi 7) aakarshak lagegaa, gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki donon kii shuruaati keemat ek samaan he
 1 in Redmi 7 8 gigahertz octa-kor kwalkom snapadragon 632 procesar kaa istemaal hua he yani aapako is smartphone main zyaada sakasham chipset milegaa
 Recall that Redmi 6 is equipped with mediatek Helio P22 processor and Redmi 6 Pro Snapdragon 625 processor
 Redmi 7 main graphics ke liye adreno 506 jeepiyu kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Xiaomi has launched two variants of Redmi 7 in India, both variants are equipped with 32 GB storage
 antar keval itnaa he ki base verient 2 jibi ram ke saath aata he jisaki bhartiya bazaar main keemat 7,999 rupee he
 At the same time, its 3 GB RAM variant costs Rs 8,999
 company kii yah ranneeti thodi atpati lagi
 If you can increase your budget by Rs 1,000, then you will get the Redmi Note 7 (review) smartphone
 vahiin, Redmi 6 ke donon hi verient 3 jibi ram vaale the
 One had 32 GB storage, which is priced at Rs 7,999, a variant of 64 GB storage will be available after spending Rs 1,500 more
 Redmi 7 main 6
 There is a 26 inch HD + (720x1520 pixels) display, its aspect ratio is 19: 9
 shaomi ne kaha ki kam keemat vaale is phone main aapako 84 pratishat antiessi color gemet milegaa
 a 3,000 mah battery was given in the Redmi 6 but in its upgraded version Redmi 7 you will get a 4,000 mah battery but it is not equipped with Qualcomm Quick Charge support
 phone ke saath 10 wat kaa charger milegaa
 Both SIM slots in Redmi 7 have 4G and volte support
 iske alaava phone main single-band vaai-faai 802
 11N, Bluetooth version 4
 2 or jeepies saport shaamil he
 Accelerometer, ambient light sensor, electronic compass sensor is part of the phone but the gyroscope sensor is not provided in the Redmi 7
 hamane paaya ki yah phone Widevine L3 diarem saport karata he naa ki phul-echdi video strimming ke liye el1 ko
 Our review unit MIUI 10 based on Android 9 Pie
 2 (MIUI 10
 2) Moving on
 shuruaati seoup process main aapako lock screen par walpaper carocel ko disable karne kaa vikalp milegaa
 Every time you unlock the phone you will see a different thing
 mjedaar baat to yah he ki samsung ke letest smartphone bhi isi plateform se las hai jo glans naam ke third party ap se paward he
 While reviewing the Samsung Galaxy M20, we did see some bold ads and better-designed snippets, but it was very annoying
 disable karne ke baad lock screen par ek sthai iken nazar aayega jo ki ise inable karne kaa ek vikalp he
 In MIUI you do not get the option of app drawer which means you will find all the icons on the home screen
 agar aap home screen par dahini taraf se swip karenge to ap walt pej khulegaa
 Here you will see advertisements for recommended apps, contests and app integration
 second spes feechar privet eps or data ke liye ek alag profile he jise aap kabhi bhi delit or riset kar sakate hai
 Not only the messenger, with the help of dual apps, you can create two models of any app
 hamane notice kiya ki google play store se kisi bhi ap ko install karte samay vigyaapan ke saath ap chekar screen pop-ap ho jaati he
 In default default keyboard you will find ASCII text effects, emoji, gifs, stickers and themes
 iske alaava me ap store or kai first party eps phone main maujuud hai
 With the help of a music app without setting up an account, you can stream the song from the commotion
 security ap main aapako virus scinar or kuch privesi tul, game speed booster, bydaree or storage control milenge jo aamtaur par settings ap main hote hai
 If we have got the 3 GB RAM variant of Redmi 7 for review, then maybe our experience is better than those who use its base variant
 Redmi 7 kaa base verient 3 jibi ram verient kii tulana main thodaa sasta he
 Redmi 7 is easy to use apart from advertising in MIUI
 kabhi-kabhi colling ke dauraan or ap swichar main scrol karte samay phone thodaa dhimaa ho jaataa tha
 The phone also has a strange problem, sometimes the notification disappears quickly, due to which it is impossible to read
 screen thodi riflactive he lekin isaki quality acchhee he
 Videos and games look good due to the screen being large
 phone main colors or vuing angel sahi se dikhaai dete hai lekin suraj kii roshni main screen par pard paane main thodi mushkil hoti he
 We were quite impressed with the speaker, it gives a loud sound without distortion
 lekin aapako zyada baas nahin milegaa
 You will also not get a headset with the phone
 google play store par aapako dikhegaa ki Asphalt 9: Legends phone ke saath compatible nahin he to ham ise test nahin kar paae
 PUBG Mobile ran on the medium settings by default
 game khilne kaa anubhav smooth tha
 After a while we notice that the upper part of the phone gets slightly warmer

 ipies adhikari kii tractor trali se kuchalakar kii gayi hatya kii madhya pradesh sarkaar dwaara nyaayik jaanch kii ghoshnaa ke bich kendriya vaanijya evam udyog rajya mantri jyotiraditya sindhiya ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar ko is ghatana kii jaanch sibiai se karaane ke bare main vichaar karnaa chaiye
 Scindia accused the BJP leaders of giving protection to the mineral mafia and said that if the state government feels any difficulty in getting to the bottom of this incident, then we are willing to cooperate with the CBI to conduct an inquiry on its request as we believe It is said that the CBI has also solved the case of RTI activist Shehla Masood murder case in Bhopal in the past
 sindhiya ne kaha ki pradesh kii aam janata ko bhi is baat kaa pakkaa vishwaas hone laga he ki khanan va bhoomi sambandhi kaaryo va isse punap rahe aparaadhon ke peeche kahi na kahin bhaajapa netaaon kaa haath he

 'illegal occupation is the real issue' Jitendra Singh said - If there is any dispute between India and Pakistan over Jammu and Kashmir, then it is only the illegal occupation of pok and gilgit-baltistan on behalf of Pakistan
 " unhone aage kaha, "use kis tarah pakistan ke kabje se mukt kara kar bhartiya loktantr kaa hissaa banaaya jaae sirf yahi ek mudda he

 loksabhaa chunaav (election 2019) ke saatven charan ke matdaan ke liye prachaar khatm ho chukaa he
 NDTV has overseen the campaign of PM Modi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi in the last seven phases
 auki aankadon ke mutabik yahjaanane kii koshish kii he ki aakhir piem modi (PM Modi) or rahul gandhi (rahul Gandhi) ke prachaar se chunaav nateezon se pehle kya sanket milte hai
 During this period, NDTV has taken note of some important things like which seat the two leaders chose, which state was their priority this time and what was the rationale behind these decisions
 baat agar piem modi (PM Modi)kii karen to unhone apane chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kul 144 reliyaan or road sho kiye
 During the election campaign, Uttar Pradesh was given the highest priority by PM Modi and BJP
 bataa den ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko uttar pradesh se 80 main se 73 siten mili thi
 This time PM Modi has done 36 rallies and road shows in Uttar Pradesh
 yani piem modi ne uttar pradesh main 2
 Have a rally on 5 seats
 uttar pradesh ke baad piem modi (PM Modi)kaa sabase zyada focus pashchim bengal par rahaa
 Where the tussle between BJP and TMC has been going on for some time
 maujuuda samay main pashchim bengal main bijepi ke paas do siten hai or wo tiemasi ko bada nuksaan pahunchane kii koshishon main juty he
 PM Modi has done 17 rallies for the 42 seats here i
e
 2
 5 seat ke liye ek raily
 After West Bengal, PM Modi has held the maximum rally in Odisha

 is tarah kii dikkat cricket srilanka ke saath bhi he, jisane australia ke khilaaf is takanic ke upyog se inkaar kar diya tha, lekin baad main vah bhi maan gaya

 guuruuvaar ko aaropee savarna parivaar ne dalit parivaar par hamalaa bhi kiya tha, jisamen chaar mahilaayein ghayal hui thim
 The Dalit family alleges that the local police did not take any action against the accused on their complaint

 Changing technology has also made it easier for filmmakers-directors to work

 He has found its cheap market in India
 vahaan ke marwel studio kii har film main indian viefex kaa istemaal ho rahaa he, webseries kii duniya bhi ab viefex ke haath main he
 There are more than 100 VFX companies operating in cities ranging from Mumbai to Hyderabad, Chennai, Bangalore, Pune

 "they believe that if Sholay were built today, only VFX would be used for train sequences
" thri idiats main boman irani ko donon haath se likhata hua or life of paai main sher ko naav par isi ke jariye dikhaaya gaya
 Despite VFX, dangerous actions are still performed by the stuntman but the risk factor has decreased

 "until 10-15 years ago, most of the films of Dharma or Yash Raj group were shot in Europe
 tab yahaan ke darshakon ke liye vahaan kii khubsuurati nai cheez thi
 Now everyone has seen it
 ab darshak ko kuch alag chahie
 "VFX is more commonly used in period films or futuristic films," said Prasad
 bharat main futuristic filmein zyada chalatin nahin, so banatin nahin
 In cinema like Bajirao and Bahubali, the maker gets the freedom to show visual big, beautiful, dangerous, so that the viewer can enjoy it
 ''sanjyalila bhansaali kii filmon se jude rahe prasad bataate hai ki bajirao mastaani viefex kii vajah se alag bani
 This gave a director like Bhansali an opportunity to enlarge his visual and create a feeling in the scene according to the story
 ''bhansaali ko drishy paintings jaisaa chahie
 Rajamouli needs larger than life things
 '' prasad ke mutabik aage jaakar badi yaa choti filmon main fark nahin rahegaa
 He is also doing several Marathi films

 Finally shooting from 30–40 horses took place

 Presently Prasad is working on Ajay Devgn's Tanaji which is a period film
 isamen badi jang nahin balki gorilla jang he
 The entire film took two-and-a-half years to design

 After Tanaji, he will do Mani Ratnam's period film and Bhansali's films
 maje kii baat he ki is takanic vishesh kii abhi tak koi khaas training nahin ho rahi he

 nichle sadan ne is vidheyak par hue mat vibhaajan main vipaksh ke sabhi sanshodhano ko khaarij karte hue or sarkari sanshodhano ko sweekaar kar dhvanimat se is vidheyak ko manjuuri de di
 Intervening in the discussion on the bill, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, "this bill will end the journey of decades of nuclear discrimination against India
 ’ unhone in aaropon ko aaj sire se khaarij kar diya ki aisa america yaa uski companiyon ke hiton ko saadhane ke liye kiya gaya he
 'it is completely wrong to say that India's interests have been compromised through this bill
 ’vidheyak ko lekar kai din chale vivaad or gatirodh ke baad sarkaar ne ise lekar vipakshi dalon kii aapattiyon ke alok main vidheyak ko naye sanshodhan pesh kiye or mukhya vipakshi dal bhaajapa sahit vibhinn dalon ko bharose main liya, jiske baad yah vidheyak paarit ho gaya
 Singh, referring to his budget presented as Finance Minister in the Congress government in 1992, said that at that time, except for a few exceptions, the opposition leaders even talked about impeachment by saying that it was made by him
 That budget was prepared in the US
 unhone kaha ki sadan main maujuud rajg ke adhyaksh laalkrishna adwani is baat ke gavaah rahe hai
 They will remember this
 singh ne kaha, is samjhaute kii prakriya 1999 se shuru hui
 i have seen the papers then
 hamaare sabhi visheshgyon or vaigyanikon kaa maananaa tha ki bharat ke khilaaf chal rahe parmaanu bhedbhaav ko samaapt karne kii jarurat he
 Strongly advocating the bill, the Prime Minister described nuclear energy as a viable option and said that through this bill, India will further expand its options for nuclear commerce with the world
 parmaanu kii bajaay taap evam pen bijli ke vikalpon ko apnaane kii daleel par unhone kaha ki sabhi adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki is vikalp kii simaaen hai or aise main parmaanu urja ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 On the apprehensions of the members regarding the nuclear accidents, the Prime Minister said that there has not been a single nuclear accident in India and full credit goes to our scientists
 unhone kaha ki iske baavjood main yah aashwaasan detaa hum ki parmaanu suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye koi kasar nahin chodi jaaegi or parmaanu urja niamak board ko or majboot banaaya jayega tathaa ise parmaanu suraksha board ke madhyam se sunishchit karenge
 In the context of nuclear technology being expensive, he said that technology is developing rapidly and no one knows what is hidden in the future womb
 lekin ham bharat ke vikaas ke liye sabhi vikalpon ke raste kholana chaahate hai
 Manmohan Singh said that our government wants to open all future options for the development of the country
 vidheyak ke mul swaroop main 17 (bi) upbandh main sanshodhan karne kaa prastaav kiya gaya tha jisaki bhaajapa or vam dalon ne kadi aalochana kii thi
 It was said to prove the intention of the supplier in the event of a compensation claim in the event of an accident
 sarkaar ne mul vidheyak main nayaa sanshodhan pesh karte hue kaha ki ab 17 (bi) upbandh main iradatan’ shabd nahin he or iske sthaan par aapurtikarta yaa uske karmchaariyon ke kaary ke maddenjar parmaanu durghatana jo ghatiya yaa trutipurna upkaran, saamagree yaa seva ke kaaran hui ho’ ko rakhaa gaya he
 In the original bill, amendments matching the new amendments introduced by the government were also introduced by the leaders of BJP and Left parties, but their amendments were rejected and the government amendments were accepted
 baad main vidheyak par hui charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajya mantri prithviraj chavaan ne kaha ki 2005 main pradhanmantri kii america yatra ke dauraan is samasya ke nidaan ke liye ek qaraar karne kii ruparekha bani lekin is disha main parmaanu daayitv kanoon na na hone se ek kami aa rahi thi kyonki parmaanu urja utpaadan karne vaale 30 deshon main se 28 main aisa kanoon he
 There is no such law only in India and Pakistan
 unhone kaha hamane vidheyak taiyaar karne main sabhi vipakshi dalon, visheshgyon evam sabhi pakshon ke saath vyapak vichaar vimarsh kiya he or is disha main mul vidheyak main 18 sanshodhano ke baad aaj ise pesh kiya gaya he jisamen bhaajapa, vam dalon or sapa jaise dalon ke sujhaavon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Chavan said the Left parties still have some concerns but i want to tell them that this is not for the help of any country
 ham bade desh hai or hamen apni jaruraton ko samajhnaa hoga
 This need is to overcome the power problem
 ’mantri ne kaha ki vidheyak ke sanshodhit swaroop ke madhyam se kisi bhi durghatana kii sthiti main tisare paksh (peedit) ko paryaapt muaavje kaa praavdhaan he jisamen abhaav main bhopal gas traasadee ke maamle main sarkaar ko kadam uthaanaa padaa or peediton ko pareshaani hui
 He said that in this bill, accountability of all parties has been fixed for suppliers, consumers, government, designers etc
 parmaanu durghatana kii sthiti main adhiktam muaavje kii raashi ko purv ke 500 karod rupaye se badhaakar 1,500 karod rupaye kar diya gaya he jo aise maamalon main america main diye ja rahi muaavja raashi ke samaan he
 Chavan said that after the first nuclear test in Pokhran, our effort to end the ban on transfer of technology by nuclear supplier countries is to achieve self-sufficiency in the region
 unhone kaha hamane sampoorn eendhan chakra, riector kaa dizin taiyaar karne, bijli paidaa karne or kachare ke punarchakran main visheshgyata hasil kar lee he lekin kuch praudyogiki hamaare paas abhi bhi uplabdh nahin hai
 However, we will set up our first fast breeder reactor by next year and in the third phase acquire the technology to use thorium which has the second largest stock in the world in India
 ’isse pehle bhaajapa ke jaswant singh ne kaha sarkaar jis jaldbaaji main yah vidheyak laai he usase sarkaar kii manshaa par shaq paidaa hota he
 By saying this, i am not trying to tarnish anyone's image, but this is sending a message that due to the pressure of US President Barack Obama's visit to India in November
 ’janata dal you ke sharad yadav ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar ne vidheyak laane main jo jaldbaaji dikhaayi he vah aane vaale samay main desh ko bahut mahangi padegi
 He said that the government has found a way to get this bill passed and he does not have the capacity to oppose it, so he does not want to talk too much on it
 marxvaadi basudev acharya ne vidheyak kaa virodh karte hue kaha ki japan, dakshin korea jaise deshon main muaavja raashi par koi seemaa nahin he or bharat ke sambandh main bhi aisa hi hona chahie
 The relationship between Mahendra Singh Dhoni and BCCI is not going well these days
 hiton main takaraav kii sthiti bisisiai ko raas nahin aa rahi he
 The new BCCI treasurer Ravi Sawant said that the Indian cricket captain should immediately disassociate himself from the company
 saavant ne kaha ki agar yah pehle unke anubandh kaa hissaa nahin tha to dhoni ko hiton main takaraav ke liye notice jari kiya janaa chahie
 Dhoni was engulfed in controversy when it was reported that he had a 15 per cent stake in Riti Sports, the company that also manages Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja and Pragyan Ojha besides the Indian captain
 company ne haalanki saaf kiya ki dhoni sirf alp samay ke liye shairdharak the or philhal company main unka koi hissaa nahin he
 Sawant said, "when Dhoni is the captain, then he should immediately separate himself from the management company
 agar yah pehle uske anubandh kaa hissaa nahin tha to dhoni ko hiton ke takaraav ke liye notice jari kiya janaa chahie
 The BCCI has said that they will look into the issue of conflict of interest after the Champions Trophy
 bisisiai ke kaary samooh ke pramukh jagmohan daalamia ne somvaar ko press conference main kaha tha, 'main champions trophy ke dauraan team ko pareshaan nahin karnaa chahta
 Nothing will be gained from this
 hamane is mudde ko dhyaan main rakhaa he
 We are looking into it, but we are not going to follow anyone
