 mere khyaal se inase pehle bharat ke paas koi vishuddh tej gendbaaj nahin tha
 Shami, another guy, is also good, but i would like to see both of them a bit more aggressive
 'rabarts se jab ye poocha gaya ki vah jab se khel rahe hai tab se ab tak ke tej gendbaaj koun the?, to unhone kaha kiyadav se pehlebahut adhik log nahin the

 The body of former Union Minister and Bihar's strongman Raghunath Jha has reached Patna
 mangalvaar ko shivahar ke unke paitruk gaanv amba kala main unka antim sanskaar hoga
 Raghunath Jha died in a hospital in Delhi late on Sunday night

 He contested the post of Chief Minister in the year 1990 and was instrumental in making Lalu Prasad the Chief Minister
 agar raghunatha jha nahin rahete to lalu prasad yadav bihar ke mukhyamantri nahin banate

 Since Lalu Prasad Yadav was the Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Legislative Assembly, his claim was also made
 aise main vidhayak dal ke netaa ke liye chunaav karana padaa
 Ramsundar Das and Lalu Prasad Yadav were face to face for the leader of the legislative party but the fight was actually between VP Singh and Devi Lal
 lalu yadav ko yah pataa tha ki wo vidhayak dal ke netaa ke ischunaav main maat kha saktehain
 Because Ramsundar Das was supported by backward-dalits as well as upper caste mlas
 lalu ke liye jutaaye votedevilal or chandrasekhar ke bich acha talmail tha or raghunatha jha chandrashekhar ke khasam khaas the aise main lalu prasad yadav ko vidhayak dal kaa netaa chunavaane ke liye tay hua ki raghunatha jha ko is dangal main khadaa kiya jaye
 Raghunath Jha stood and got the support of 27 mlas
 lekin jeet lalu prasad yadav kii hui kyonki raghunatha jha ramsundar das kaa vot kaatane main safal rahe
 In 1997, when it came to Lalu Prasad Yadav going to jail in the fodder scam, it was Raghunath Jha who said that rivers of blood will flow
 halaki 1998 main lalu prasad yadav se matbhed ho jane ke baad unhone 1998 main argedy chhod kar nitish kumaar kii party main chale gaye the

 pichley maheene relies hue jane maane british band 'cold play' ke gane Hymn for The Weekend kaa video kya aapako yaad he? darasal holi ke is khaas maukey par is video kaa jahan main aana laazmi he, kyonki is band kaa ye video bharat ke jane maane tyoharon main se ek holi ke tyohaar par besd he
 The special thing about this song is that the entire video of it speaks to the Indian culture, especially the Holike festival
 holi ke rangon se saje is video ke band members bhiholike rangon se sarabor najar aate hai
 The video shows a different hangover among people regarding the festival of Holi
 'coldple' ke is video membollywood actress sonam kapur par bhi kuch ansh filmaaya gaya he
 The members of 'coldplay', who are widely appreciated for Hymn for The Weekend, are also seen in the colors of Holi on the cover photo of their 'coldplay' Twitter account
 aisa lagata he ki ayodhya maamle kaa faisla aasthaa or vishwaas ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya gaya he
 The court has declared the disputed site as the birthplace of Lord Rama on the basis of people's faith
 is faisle se ek jo sabase acchhee baat hui wo yah he ki aise sabhi tatwon ko jo samay samay par is mudde ko lekar sampradayik unmaad bhadakaate rahe hai unhen is faisle se koi mauka nahin milegaa
 Also, after this decision, there will be no political benefit of this issue
 isliye vishwa hindu parishad ne pehle hi yah kaha he ki jo do anya vivaadit sthal (kaashi or mathura) hai unka bhi swaamitv unhen saunp diya jaae
 The Congress was very apprehensive at first about what decision will come in this matter, but now that the decision has come, the Congress will surely be happy because now the BJP will not be able to redeem the Ram temple issue in future elections
 is faisla kaa taatkaalik asar aagaamee bihar vidhansabha chunaavon ke prachaar main dikhaai degaa
 Though most of the riots are pre-planned, but at the moment no one can say that the non-responsible elements will not try to make any kind of mess because it is seen only after some time
 isliye yah dekhne kii jarurat he ki rajya sarkaar sthiti ko kaise sambhalati he
 One thing is clear right now, the Sunni Waqf Board is going to appeal against the decision in the Supreme Court
 elahabaad hoicourt ke teen jajon kii peeth main bahumat kii raay yahi thi ki 2
 The disputed site of 77 acres where the Babri Masjid was located before it was demolished in 1992 is owned by both Hindus and Muslims
 chunki maamle ke teenon hi paksh vivaadit jameen par apana kabja maang rahe the isliye is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki wo supreme court main apil karen
 But it is certain that the Muslim parties will appeal to the Supreme Court because the court has made the faith and faith of Hindus the basis for the verdict, and has given the Hindu ownership to the place below the dome in the middle of the mosque
 court ne us sthaan ko ramalala kaa janmasthan mana he
 The judges held that neither party had a clear right to the disputed site
 jajon ne nirnay diya ki vivaadit jameen ko teen baraabar hisson main baanta jaae jisamen se ek hissaa sunni vakf board ko diya jaae
 Out of the remaining two parts, one each should be given to Shri Ramlala Virajaman and Nirmohi Akhara
 keval nyaayadhish dharmaveer sharma chaahate the ki puraa vivaadit sthal hinduon ko saunp diya jaae
 Significantly, Justice Sharma is retiring on 1 October
 baaki ke do jajon justise sudhir agarwal or justise es you khan ne jameen ko teen hisson main baantne kaa faisla kiya
 However, the place where Ramlala is sitting is now given to Sri Ramlala Virajaman while the Nirmohi Akhara is owned by Ram Chabutra and Sita's kitchen

 satnami samaaj ke ek shaks ko sapana aayaa tha ki us jameen par unke guru kaa janm hua tha
 This dream was discussed among the community members
 iske baad is samudaay ke logon ne saal 2003 main nirupama bajpeyi ke jameen par kabza karne kaa asafal prayaas kiya
 After this, in 2008, again led by Guru Baladas, the mob tried to occupy this land
 unhen rokane ke liye police ko kadi mashkkt kerani padi
 In the same case, criminal cases were registered against about 75 people, including Baldas
 yah maamla bilaspur jila adaalat main vichaaradhin he
 The testimony is also in the final stages after the charge sheet has been filed against all the accused
 maamle main guru baldas samet sabhi aropiyon ko sajaa mil sakati he
 Due to this, the BJP government suddenly took a decision to withdraw the case
 philhal rajya sarkaar kii ore se daakhil arji par mangalvaar ko sunwaayee hone ke asaar he
 On the other hand, the aggrieved family and several social organizations are preparing to plead in the district court to reject this application
 yah adaalat ke rukh par hi nirbhar karegaa ki vah sarkaar kii manshaa par apni muhar lagaae yaa nahin? sarkaar kii manshaa ko jaahir karte hue lok abhiyojak ne CRPC kii dhara 321 kii tahat aavedan prastut kiya he

 sharten lagu Former Chief Election Commissioner SY Qureshi said on Saturday that there is no possibility of tampering with the EVM-VVPAT system but the Election Commission should explain the opposition and people and remove doubts about it
 haal ke loksabhaa chunaav main vipaksh ne aarope lagaaya tha ki electranik voting mashin (iviem) or vivipat (voter veryphid paper trail mashin) se chhedchhad kii ja rahi he
 The allegations were rejected by the Election Commission
 aaropon ke bare main tippanee puche jane par kuraishi ne kaha, ‘iviem yaa vivipat pranali main chhedchhad kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 The machine cannot show separate figures
 'unhone kaha, ‘prayek baar aap batan dabaaenge, usamen ek hi aankada hoga
 i do not even understand the charge
 haalanki, chunaav ayog ko vipaksh or logon ko yah samajhaana chahie ki pranali pukhta he
 We have to take people along
 ' unhone dilli main ek samaaroh main kaha ki ki logon kaa vishwaas barkaraar rakhana hoga or use jeetna hoga
 Qureshi said that evms cannot be tampered with as there are many investigations
 saath hi unhone kaha, ‘abhi tak koi bhi yah sabit nahin kar paaya he ki isse chhedchhad ho sakati he or vivipat shuru hone ke baad chhedchhad kii koi bhi ashanka puri tarah se samaapt ho jaani chahie
 On the opposition's demand to revert to the ballot system, Qureshi said that instead of ending evms, the possibility of improvement in these machines should be explored
 kuraishi ne kaha, ‘mataptr kii ore waapas lautne kaa koi sawaal nahin he
 We have been improving the VVPAT and EVM system
 yadi or sudhaar kii zarurat hogi, use dekha janaa chahie
 On May 23, two days before the counting of votes, a political dispute had arisen over the alleged tampering of evms
 supreme court ne pichley maheene 21 raajnneetik dalon kii ore se daayar us arji ko khaarij kar diya tha
 In that application, it was requested to review the order of April 8 in which the Election Commission was directed that the votes of evms of five polling booths per assembly constituency should be matched with VVPAT slips
 kaam se zyada apane bayanon ke kaaran charchaa main rahane vaale bihar ke mukhyamantrijithan ram maanjhiper somvaar ko ek yuvak ne juuta phenkane kii koshish kii
 This incident of throwing the shoe has happened during the Janata Durbar, while the shoe did not reach CM Manjhi
 maukey par maujuud police or surakshakarmiyon ne yuvak ko hiraasat main le liya he
 According to police, the young man who threw the shoe is a resident of Chapra

 haalanki, vahaan maujuud logon or surakshakarmiyon ne samay rahete ise bhaanp liya or juuta maanjhi tak nahin pahunch sakaa
 The police has taken the young man into custody, but no information has yet been revealed as to why he did so
 gauratlab he ki rajanetaaon par juuta phenkane kii ghatana isse pehle bhi ho chuki he
 Last year, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal also threw a shoe at the young man during the Independence Day program
 jabaki congress ke yuvaraj rahul gandhi bhi un rajanetaaon main shumaar hai, jin par juuta phenkaa gaya he
 Bihar affected by campaigning for brother-in-law Chiranjeevi Rao, Tejashwi is not getting rid of the floods and Bihar is flooded but Patna's Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav is nowhere to be seen

 Is Tejashwi playing kinship? Some picture of Tejashwi Yadav has surfaced on social media
 tasveeron main tejasvi yadav haryana chunaav main apni rishtedaari nibhaate dikh rahe hai
 In fact, Tejashwi Yadav is campaigning for his brother-in-law Chiranjeevi Rao in Rebari, contesting on the Congress ticket in Haryana elections
 aise main sawaal uth khadaa hua he ki kya tejasvi yadav bihar kii janata se zyada apni rishtedaari ko mahatv dete hai
 Tejaswi Yadav is in charge of the political campaign in Bihar from the nomination of his brother-in-law to the election campaign
 aise main tejasvi ko lekar bihar main siyasat tej ho gai he
 Political experts believe that Tejashwi Yadav has not been able to recover since the debacle in the Lok Sabha, so he is constantly missing from Bihar
 chaahe mujffarpur main bacchon kii hui maut kaa maamla ho yaa phir bihar main baadh kaa kahar ho, tejasvi ke paas bihar kii janata kii sud lene kii fursat nahin he
 In between, his tweets keep coming in to curse Nitish Sarkar

 This was not the election of Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, Prashant Bhushan or Kumar Vishwas
 kuch netaaon or partiyon ko bhram tha ki ve desh ko lutate rahenge auki ham bebas dekhte rahenge
 Shahnaz Hindustani is sitting here, has not been home for six months
 ek doctor munish rayjada hai
 Closed his clinic from Canada
 puure desh or videsh se dheron log apni naukari chhod aa gaye
 He took leave of two to three months
 in logon ko arvind yaa aam aadmi party se pyaar nahin tha
 He saw hope of changing the country
 ye ummid lekar aae hai doston
 This is a very big thing
 jab logon ne kahana chaalu kar diya tha ki yahaan kuch nahin badal saktaa, tab is andolan ne ek ummid di he
 You guys have done a great job
 badhai
 Congratulations to your families as well
 yahaan bahut se walantirs hai, jinke bivi, bacchon or parivaar waalon ne saath diya
 There are also many family members, whose son or daughter, when they came to this movement, they were hurt and protested
 magar in logon ne parvaah nahin kii
 Congratulations to all of them when the rickshaw puller donated 30 rupees
 
 
 main ek maheene se road sho kar rahaa tha
 One day a poor man came during this show
 usne jeb main haath daalaa or jitne paise the, sab de die
 Said that i ride a rickshaw and have earned thirty rupees since morning
 ye main aapaki party ko daan dena chahta hum
 Friends, that rickshawman has fought this election
 ye vijay baba ne ladaa he, jo rickshaw chalaate hai auki chah maheene se party ke liye bina paisa liye rickshaw chalaa rahe hai
 And who fought the election
 manch par baithe in saathiyon ne, jinhen koi nahin jaanata
 Who are these people koi nahin jaanata
 Rakhi Birla is a little girl who defeated Rajkumar Chauhan, the cabinet minister of Congress
 koi ye soch nahin saktaa tha ki bees saal se jeetne vaale ko koi haraa paaegaa
 This vandana
 ek maamuli housewif, inhone 15 saal se vidhayak rabindra baansal ko haraa diya
 Akhilesh Tripathi, who came out of his studies of civil services, defeated a prominent leader
 ye sab aam log hai
 Kejriwal read and heard the leaders of the poignant letter that they would continue to be robbed
 ye nahin pataa tha ki aam aadmi khadaa ho gaya, to unke singhaasana hill jaaenge
 Now we have to take this fight across the country
 aapmen bahut se log hai, jo pehle congress or bijepi main the
 But now all are leaving their previous parties and fighting for the country
 abhi do minute pehle kisi ne badi maarmik chitthee di he mujhe
 i read it to you
 aadarneey arvind ji
 My name is Bajrang Aggarwal
 main rohinee kaa rahane vaala hum
 i am a law graduate and worked for Congress for many years
 mere man main boj he ki apana keemtee samay aisi party ke liye lagaaya, jo karpshan main dubi he
 When you started the movement, it seemed that a lonely chap cannot break
 par aaj lagata he ki bhaad hi nahin phod saktaa, use chakanachur kar saktaa he
 When i reached home after voting on December 4, my five-year-old son asked, who won the election
 maine kaha, betaa abhi rigelt nahin aayaa
 He said with great enthusiasm that our broom will win
 mujhe laga ki maine kahin galat to nahin kar diya
 i asked what he knew
 to usne kaha ki mere sabhi dost kah rahe hai ki ye jhaadu vaale desh badal denge, bahut achche log hai
 If my son did not say this, i probably would not have written these letters
 ab boj kuch kam ho gaya he
 Somewhere tomorrow, a common man does not have to get up to break our pride, but here is a prayer to our MLA companions, do not get into pride
 aaj ham logon ne bijepi or congress kaa ahankaar todaa he, kahin aisa na ho ki kal kisi aam aadmi ko khadey hokar hamaara ahankaar todna pade
 You have given big responsibility to people
 aapako netaa vidhayak nahin bananaa
 To serve the people
 mujhe pataa chalaa ki kuch jagah jashn manaa, pataakhe phode gaye
 What is the celebration of? hamaari jeet he kya
 The people of the country win
 aapkaa kaam pataakhe phodna nahin, janata kii seva karnaa he
 Do not become a little proud, otherwise you will become part of whatever you have to change
 torch ke chalate nahin mila aap ko bahumatahamen 28 seat mili hai
 Not that we could not get a majority
 magar aakhri vakt virodhiyon ne kai hatkande apanaae
 In 16 assemblies, a flashlight was issued to match the election symbol of the broom
 ye bilkul jhaadu jaisaa dikhataa tha
 Independents were erected with this sign at 16 places
 inhen koi nahin jaanata tha
 He did not campaign
 magar phir bhi inako chaar paanch hajaar vot pade
 People came to press the button on him in a misunderstanding
 jaise kalkaji main ham 2 hajaar vot se haare
 But Torch received more than 3500 votes
 us din saadhe nau baje tak poling hui
 But some channels started showing after five o'clock that BJP is getting majority and Aam Aadmi Party will be reduced to six seats
 iske chalate congress ke khilaaf gusse main bhare log bijepi ko vot daal aae is dar se ki kahin unka vot barbaad na ho jaae
 But ok upar vaala jo bhi karata he, thik karata he
 We got 28 seats, thanks to the one above
 ab yahaan se is ladaai ko aage le jaaenge
 Played a lot of money
 jhuggiyon main daaru or paisa baanta gaya
 We were afraid that the vote will not be sold with money
 magar data bataa rahaa he ki jhuggivaasiyon ne paisa daaru to sabase liya
 But the vote was cast on the broom
 unhen badhai
 People have been cheated by the parties who have been cheating for 65 years and this has shocked them
 haarane vaale vidhayak baukhala gaye hai
 News is being received from many places
 ek vidhansabha seat se samachar mila ki abhi tak jo vidhayak the, unke paas pani ke sabhi booster pump kii chaabi thi
 They stopped giving water
 ek or vidhayak ne kaha ki ab kachra uthaanaa band
 Aam Aadmi Party workers pick up the garbage now
 meri party ke vidhayakon se apil he
 There is an appeal to the election losers to go and work among the public
 4 seat khareednaa kya mushkil tha bijepi ke liechunaav main 31 seat bijepi ko mili
 An Akali Dal was found
 hamen 28 seat mili
 So the BJP had to form the government
 chaar seat khareednaa kya mushkil tha unke liye
 Have been doing so far
 magar ve bole ki nahin aisa nahin karenge
 Good thing, late Ayad corrected Ayad
 meraa bijepi se sawaal he ki agar unhen centre yaa kisi or rajya main bahumat nahin mila, to kya vah sarkaar bananaa band kar denge
 Or it is a blank stare
 congress-bijepi milakar banaaen sarkarabijepi auki congress ek si partiyaan hai
 Both cause corruption and riot
 ab donon milakar sarkaar bana len, aam aadmi party vipaksh main baithegi
 Are we ready if both these parties impose elections on Delhi
 haa ham taiyaar hai
 The people of Delhi are ready
 agle chunaav main bijepi ko chunaav dena vot barbaad karnaa he
 Because he runs responsibly
 ham satta bhogane ke liye nahin aa rahe
 Now the fight has to be taken all over the country
 dilli kii janata ne desh ko ek disha di he
 The father who was trying to give the ticket, his father fell into the feet
 There is a boy, we were thinking of giving him the ticket
 uske pita aae or pairon main gir gaye

 Do not put it in the mud
 ye logon kii soch thi
 But now thinking is changing
 ab is lau ko puure desh main le janaa he
 Few people cannot do this work
 hamaari party vaale nahin kar sakate
 This is not a battle of the Aam Aadmi Party
 ye desh kii ladaai he
 So i want to call on this platform that the good people of the country, good political forces, good movements are gathered
 ek mauka mila he is desh ko badalane kaa
 If this happens, the country will soon be called a golden bird

 The honest people of BJP and Congress leave their knees and join this fight of freedom
 sarkaar lokapal nahin jokapaal bill laa rahi henna hajaare ji anshan par baithe hai
 The government has given a statement today that the Lokpal bill was passed in the Lok Sabha

 This will increase corruption

 Salutes Anna's awakening

 He said that people of the political party will not be allowed to come on the stage

 PDP spokesman Naeem Akhtar said that the meeting lasted for about five hours, in which no decision could be reached on an alliance with the BJP

 He said that in this meeting, all party leaders should put forth their views

 badhati technology ke saath logon kaa jivan din-ba-din badalata ja rahaa he
 But the protection of the environment is an important issue
 paryaavaran ko bachaane ke liye plastic ko risical kiya ja rahaa he
 Many useful items are being made from plastic
 hyderabad ke ek professor ne plastic se jo banaaya he uski aap kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate
 The 45-year-old Professor Satish Kumar, who hails from Hyderabad, has surprised people with the feat of making plastic petrol
 plastic se petrol banane kii prakriya ko unhone plastic pirolisis naam diya he
 Satish Kumar has formed a company named Hydroxy Private Limited
 jo atilaghu, laghu or madhyam udhyam mantralay ke tahat register he
 According to News18, Satish says that with the help of plastic pyrolysis process, plastic can be made from diesel, aviation fuel and petrol
 lagbhag 500 kilogram risical na hone vaale plastic se 400 litre eendhan kaa utpaadan kiya ja saktaa he
 He said that it is an easy process in which no water is used nor dirty water comes out
 saath hi yah hawa ko pradooshit bhi nahin karata kyonki yah prakriya nirvaat main hoti he
 The suspense came to an end with Narendra Modi's announcement to contest from Banaras whether he would contest from Uttar Pradesh or not
 dilachasp baat yah he ki media main chaahe ise lekar suspence bana rahaa ho, lekin khud narendra modi yah faisla pichley saal july main hi kar chuke the
 The senior-most leaders of the party were given this information and discussions were also held with the leadership of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 darasal, yojana yah thi ki modi gujarat main laalkrishna adwani kii seat gandhinagar se or uttar pradesh main murali manohar joshi kii seat banaras se chunaav ladenge
 Both these senior leaders were to be sent to the Rajya Sabha so that there would be no confusion about Modi's leadership in the party
 haalanki yah yojana sire nahin chadh saki
 Both advani-joshi were not ready to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 sangh bhi in donon netaaon par ek seemaa se adhik dabaav banane ke liye taiyaar nahin hua
 The result is that Joshi vacated the Benaras seat for Modi, but had to be sent to Kanpur
 isi tarah adwani gandhinagar se hi ladane par ade hai, lihaaza modi paas kii ahmedabad purv seat se chunaav ladenge
 Modi's lieutenant Amit Shah is trying to rebuild the party in Uttar Pradesh
 rajya bhar main ghumkar or tamaam logon se milakar unhone ye fizback diya ki modi ke naam par rajya main bijepi ko zabardast samarthan mil rahaa he
 Modi's image of development and Hindutva is overshadowing caste politics in the state for years
 modi kaa pichde varg kaa hona, bijepi ke liye adhik laabhakaari ho rahaa he, kyonki pichde varg main yah sandesh ja rahaa he ki pehali baar bijepi ke madhyam se desh main ek majboot vyakti unke varg se pradhanmantri banane ja rahaa he
 Amit Shah also suggested that if Modi fights UP, then it will be benefited in the entire Purvanchal
 vaise uttar pradesh ke liye bijepi kii 53 ummidavaaron kii pehali suchi main jatigat samikarnon kaa khaas dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 In the list of BJP for UP divided into eight provinces according to the Union, the emphasis is that the caste of the candidate is kept in mind while giving tickets to the surrounding seats, so that the balance is maintained
 amit shah rajya ke party netaaon ko kehete rahe hai ki chunaav modi ke naam par ladaa jayega or isliye logon ko yah sandesh diya jaae ki har seat par modi hi chunaav lard rahe hai
 In UP, the BJP has not aligned with any other party, nor has it been able to align with smaller parties
 isaki bharpai ke liye party duusare dalon se kuch taaqatvar netaaon ko apane saath laakar tikat de rahi he
 a large number of mlas have also been given tickets
 in sabake baavjood upi main bijepi ke prachaar kaa puraa fokas narendra modi par hi rahegaa
 No wonder the bjp's slogan of 'har-har Modi, ghar-ghar Modi' started during Modi's Banaras rally is now echoing as 'jan-jan Modi, ghar-ghar Modi' all over Uttar Pradesh 
 bhale hi aapane lakh mehnat se khaanaa banaaya ho

 kendra sarkaar ne buudhvaar ko dilli ucch nyaayalay ko bataaya ki congress athwa bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko chanda dene vaali videshi companiyaan nahin hai
 a PIL filed in the court complained that in violation of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, many foreign companies like Vedanta Resources are providing funds to the Congress and the BJP
 kendra ne kaha he ki vedanta resorcej pielsi sahit janhit yachika main jin companiyon kaa naam videshi company ke taur par diya gaya he ve ‘videshi company’ ke daayre main nahin aatin
 In an affidavit filed before the bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Indramit Kaur, the Ministry of Home Affairs has said that it has received information about the status of six out of seven companies from the Foreign Division of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs
 iske alaava sambandhit companiyon se bhi videshi bhagidaari niyaman adhinium (epasiare) ke tahat unki sthiti ke bare main jaankaree maangi
 As per the affidavit filed by the Ministry, m / s Vedanta, The Madras Aluminum Company Limited, m / s Hyatt Regency, m / s Win Medicare Pvt
 limited, macers adani vilmer ke li
 , m / s Sterlite Industries India Ltd
 videshi companiyaan nahin hai, jabaki macers diodblyoo chemicals international pra
 Ltd
 videshi company kii shrenee main hai
 The Ministry has said that apart from this, information about m / s Sesa Goa Limited is yet to come
 maamle kii sunwaayee ke antim din nyaayalay ne congress or bhaajapa donon ko hi notice jari kiya tha
 He was asked for his response to the PIL
 yah yachika ek gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan association for democredit rifarm ne vakil prashanth bhushan ke jariye daayar kii thi
 The petition calls for political parties to be investigated by the CBI or Special Investigation Team (SIT) for accepting donations through subsidiaries of the uk-based Vedanta Group
 peeth ne congress or bhaajapa donon se sarkaar ke shapath-patr ke saath unki pratikriya bhi maangi he

 loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad rahul gandhi ne choda tha adhyaksh padsonia gandhi ke adhyaksh banane ke baad rahul ke karibiyon par giri gaajatanvar or sanjay nirupam ne khulkar lagaae sonia ke karibiyon par aropaloksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad rahul gandhi ne jimmedaari lete hue congress ke adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 For a long time, he was respected, but Rahul did not agree and eventually Sonia Gandhi was appointed the interim president of the Congress instead of Rahul
 sonia ke kaman sambhalate hi congress main old guard ke reective hone kii charchaa hone lagi or rahul ke karibiyon par kinare hone kaa sankat bhi chaane laga
 It was seen on many occasions
 haal main party chhodane vaale ashok tanvar ne bhi is tarah ke aarope lagaae or sanjay nirupam ne bhi sidhe par taur par sonia gandhi ko unke karibiyon se bachane kii salaah de daali
 Under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, faces like Ashok Tanwar, Sanjay Nirupam, Milind Deora, Deb Burman and Navjot Singh Sidhu were preferred
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav kii haar ke baad jaise hi rahul ne adhyaksh pad choda, in karibiyon par gaaj girani shuru ho gai
 There was a tussle between Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on several occasions
 siddhu rahul ko apana captain bataate rahe or kabhi amarinder singh ko apana leader sweekaar nahin kar paae
 Ultimately, the result was that Sidhu's innings faded in front of Captain Amarinder and he had to lose everything
 ashok tanvar kaa patta kataahaal hi main haryana main bhi rahul kii team ko ek jhatka laga, jab ashok tanvar ko adhyaksh pad se hataa diya gaya
 Former Chief Minister and senior leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda continued to oppose Ashok Tanwar and he was relieved of responsibility by the Congress headed by Sonia Gandhi just before the election
 haalanki, saamanjasy hooda yaa unke parivaar ko bhi party kii kaman nahin saunpi gai or sonia kii kareebi maane jane vaali kumari shailaja ko pradesh kii kaman saunpkar saamanjasy sthapit karne kii koshish kii gai
 Sonia's team was clearly visible in this decision
 sonia gandhi ke kareebi ahamed patel or hooda ke achche sambandh hai
 Not only this, Ghulam Nabi Azad, incharge of Haryana, continued to convince the high command that no coin other than Bhupendra Singh Hooda would be able to run in front of the BJP
 lihaaja, is puri ladaai main hooda vinar sabit hue
 Sanjay Nirupam also raised questions Sanjay Nirupam, who was president of Mumbai Congress, also gave a big blow to the party in the midst of elections
 party netritv par sawaal uthaate hue sanjay nirupam ne kaha ki sonia gandhi ko apane darbariyon se mukti pani chahie
 However, he also said that he is not against Sonia Gandhi, but Nirupam also appealed to Rahul Gandhi to end his exile and take command of the party
 sanjay nirupam ke is bayaan ne bhi congress ke bheetar sonia gandhi or rahul kii team ke bich ke andruni gatirodh ko saarvajanik manch par laane kaa kaam kiya he
 On the other hand, Ashok Tanwar has clearly accused Sonia Gandhi's team leaders of serious charges and claimed that the party has sidelined Rahul Gandhi's loyalists
 rahul gandhi ke ek aise hi kareebi maane jane vaale yuva netaa pradhyut deb burman se bhi tripura main congress kii kaman chhin chuki he
 On resigning from the post of state president, Deb Burman said that the entry of corrupt people has been done in the Congress
 deb burman ke alaava rahul gandhi ke kareebi maane jane vaale milind devda ko bhi mumbai congress adhyaksh pad se istipha dena padaa he
 That is, Rahul Gandhi's leaving the post of the Speaker after the defeat of the Lok Sabha elections has overshadowed many of his close leaders
 yahi vajah he ki sonia gandhi ke adhyaksh rahete kinare kiye ja rahe rahul ke kareebi bhi khulkar ye mudda uthaa rahe hai or sonia gandhi ko apane karibiyon se bachane kii naseehat de rahe hai
 In Assam's Nalbari district, on Friday, RTI activist and Team Anna member Akhil Gogoi was attacked by suspected activists of the Youth Congress, in which he was seriously injured

 (sabhi laghukathaayen or sukhtiyaan balram agarwal dwaara angreji se anudit) The Maharashtra assembly elections are at a crossroads where both alliance partners are eating into each other's vows, but suspicion of intentions is going on simultaneously

 Maharashtra has a total of 288 assembly seats, and till now the formula of 169–119 has been going on between the Shiv sena-bjp alliance, which the BJP now wants to change under any circumstances
 uski yah maang us aatmavishvaas se paidaa hui he, jiskaa aadhaar uskaa ab tak kaa shandaar strike rate he
 In the recent Lok Sabha elections, BJP has got 23 seats and Shiv Sena has 18 seats, and BJP has emerged as the party with the most votes in Maharashtra
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main bijepi ko 27 fisadi vot mili the, jabaki shivasena ko 21 fisadi, or yahi bade hue vot bijepi kaa hausala buland kar rahe hai, or isiilie baar-baar shivasena yaad dilaanaa nahin bhuulati ki loksabhaa kii baat or thi, vidhansabha kii kahani kuch or he
 By the way, if the victory of the Lok Sabha of this alliance is converted into assembly seats, then they can get about 231 seats
 bijepi kah rahi he ki ab 135−135 kaa formula lagu kiya jaae, yani baraabar siten, or bachi hui 18 siten saathi dalon ko de di jaaen
 BJP has a new formula - the strength of which, its status
 
 
 shivasena iske liye taiyaar nahin he, vah maanati rahi he ki loksabhaa chunaavon main vah bijepi ko tarjeeh detii rahi he
 In the recent past, the BJP has reinvented itself, and the etiquette between the two parties has also lost its arithmetic
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah mumbai aae, to saare kyrkram pehle se tay the, or shivasena pramukh ke ghar jane kaa koi program nahin tha, lekin unke aane ke baad ghar jane kii aupchaarikta bhi puri kar di gai
 This suggests that the Shiv Sena can now only speculate on the bjp's footsteps, and this phase of speculation is going to continue even further, as Amit Shah is again on a three-day tour of the state, and no such indication yet
 Found that he will come forward to solve this math

 One of the money that came out of the ATM was a note that was in 2000, half of the note was real but half had a piece of paper attached to it
 shaadaab choudhary naam ke shaks jo aaj kareeb 12:00 baje ke kareeb apane yas bank ke acount se paise nikaalane ke liye disibi bank ke atm pahunche the
 He took out ten thousand rupees from an ATM located in Jamia area, but out of that, a 2000 note was made out of which half of it was of paper and half of it was of Aslinot
 note ko dekhakar peedit ne customer care ko kol kiya lekin customer care se koi aashwaasan na paakar peedit bank pahunchaa, tab bank waalon ne shikaayat darj kar jaanch kii baat kahi he
 The victim has complained to the police about this
 bank se aise noton ke nikalne kii vajah se sawaal uthta he ki bhashtachar jab bank se hi khatm nahin ho paa rahaa toaam janata kii pareshanika hal kaise hoga
 At the time of demonetisation, when will the people who are standing in queues end such problems in the end? ab tak aapane bacchon kii anokhi or masti kii paathshaalaayein dekhi or suni hongi, lekin madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal main maa-bacchon kii anokhi paathshaala he, jahaan bacchon ko to masti karne kaa puraa mauka miltaa hi he, maanen bhi apane bacchon kii masti kaa hissaa ban jaati hai

 Bhagwandin, a 75-year-old farmer from Bannirai village of Biswan block, 40 km east of Sitapur district headquarters in Uttar Pradesh, has been cultivating sugarcane in his one-acre field for 60 years
 par ab unki himmat jawaab de gai he
 His family is constantly growing up but income from farming is shrinking
 kuredne par bhagavanadin kaanpate haathon se ek jarjar diary ke panne palatney lagate hai jisamen ganne kii kheti kii laagat kaa hisaab he
 By emphasizing thick eye glasses, Bhagwandin starts counting the cost of about 250 quintals of sugarcane born on an acre of farmland
 khet kii jutai main kul kharch 2,500 ru
 , Rs 6,000 on seed
 , sinchai par 12,000 ru
 , Rs 2,400 on DAP manure
 , uria par 2,000
 One by one they incurred a total expenditure of 53,500 rupees in hoeing, bonding, chipping, hauling and pesticides
 gina dete hai
 Last month, they sold their entire sugarcane to the purchase center of the twentieth sugar mill opened in the village
 paisa to abhi mila nahin par rajya sarkaar kii ore se nirdhaarit 280 ru
 The first installment of State Advisory Price (SAP) per quintal i

 Rs 230
 prati quintal kii dar se bhagavanadin ko sirf 57,500 ru

 agar chunavi varsh main bhagavanadin ko apana puraa paisa chini mil se mil bhi jaae to saal bhar kii kamai 16,500 ru
 Will be sitting i
e
 Rs 1,400 every month
 se bhi kuch kam
 Extremely disappointed Bhagavadin says, "1,400
 maheene main to do chote poton ke liye do vakt ke doodh kaa intjaam bhi mushkil he
 "the rising cost of sugarcane cultivation and shrinking income due to no increase in the purchase price has broken their back
 bannirai ke hi nahin, rajya ke 40 lakh kisaanon ke saamne parivaar kaa pet paalane kaa sankat he jo is chunavi varsh main ganne ke kharid mulya badaae kii aas lagaae hue the
 In some way, by fighting with the sugar mills, the farmers got the outstanding money of the previous year's produce, but the next battle was also started
 is varsh chini ke daam 3,000 ru
 Despite reaching above the per quintal, the State Government has paid the State Advisory Price (SAP) of sugarcane to the mills at Rs 280
 prati quintal main pichley teen varshon kii tarah is baar bhi vruddhi nahin kii he (dekhen chart)
 Angry farmers, demonstrating together in the state on February 1, indicated that now they are not going to sit silent
 chini milon par meharbaanikisaanon kii keemat par chini mil maalikon ko phayda pahunchane kaa aarope niraadhaar nahin he
 With the government not raising the state advisory price of sugarcane to be purchased from farmers, the government paid Rs 230 as the first installment to sugar mills
 prati quintal kii dar se kisaanon ko bhugtan karne kaa aadesh bhi diya jo pichley varsh se 10 ru
 Is less per quintal
 supreme court main kisaanon kii pairvi kar rahe ve
 M
 singh kehete hai, ''sarkaar chini milon se kisaanon ko pichhlaa bhugtan hi nahin karvaa pai he, baavjood iske is varsh milon ke liye bhugtan kii pehali kist bhi kam kar di
 For the crushing season 2014-15, the government gave exemption from sugar mills by purchasing sugarcane, entering on sugar, commissions to societies, along with the first 8 of the mills 'share in the farmers' account
 60 ru
 20 per quintal and later Rs
 prati quintal kii dar se bhugtan kiya
 In this way, the government raised a total of Rs 2,930 crore
 kii madad kisaanon ko di
 Despite this, the mills paid farmers Rs 704 crore in the previous crushing season
 kaa bhugtan nahin kiya he
 The worst case is that of Titawi, Mawana, Malkapur, Modinagar, Nyoli, Baghauli mills which have been able to pay 60 per cent

 There is a race to go beyond the limits of hatred in the horror of the world
 tabhi rojaanaa saamne aate iesas ke teror videos se do kadam aage bad kar ab taliban or al-kaayda jaise aatankwaadi sanghathanon ne jin karatuuton kaa video jari kiya he, unhen dekh kar duniya daanton tale ungali dabaane ko majaboor ho gai he
 In these videos, pictures of anyone publicly chopping their hands and crushing them with stones to kill the girl are captured
 afghanistan se lekar nyeegeria or nyeegeria se lekar kenya takanfrat or dahshatki dukaan sajaae in aatankwaadiyon kii ye tasviren dekh kar yakeen karnaa mushkil hota he ki ye bhi aapaki or hamaari tarah isi duniya ke bascindia hai
 It is difficult to believe that a person's heart beats in his chest too? And it is difficult to believe that they too are humans just like you and us
 isi duniya main rah kar or isi hawa main saans lekar bhi in aatankwaadiyon kii jehniyat hamase itani alag he ki usamen raham or insaaniyat jaise alphaajon ke liye shaayad koi jagah nahin he
 Only then do these terrorists kill a girl with stones in the guilt of having a relationship with a boy before marriage, then they cut off the hands of a couple simply because they are separated There is a charge of theft and in the training of these terrorists before executing such cruel actions, they are seen running and dragging the unruly animals
 vaise to in aatankwaadiyon kii badaulat duniya pehle hibahut berahamidekh chuki he lekin phir bhi teen alag-alag mulkon se saamne ai darindagi kii in teen tasveeron ne logon ke rongte phir se khadey kar die hai
 From the top it is true that these pictures of hate and brutality have been released on social media by the same terrorists themselves
 dehshat kii teen alag-alag kahaniyanghor, central provins, afghanistanek sunsaan patharilii jagah par aatankwaadiyon ne pehle se hi ek gaddha khod kar rakhaa tha or us gadde main wo ladki bhi maujuud thi, jise nazaij rishton ke iljaam main pattharon se maar-maar kar maut ke ghat utaara janaa tha
 The girl's arms and legs were tied in such a way that she could neither free herself nor run away from here
 taliban ke local aria commander ne pehle vahaan maujuud duusare dehshatgardon ko oonchi aawaaj main ladki ke gunaah ke bare main bataaya or phir sangsar kar yani pattharon se kuchal kar maut ke ghat utaarne kaa hukum de diya
 After this, it is also difficult to see what all the people present there do
 log pattharon se gadde main padi ladki par tabadatod hamalaa karte hai
 Seeing it, it starts raining stones on all four sides
 pehle to wo cheekhti he, tadapati he
 The terrorists and all the people present there beg for mercy, but there is no word of mercy in the dictionary of these terrorists
 lihaaja, uski tamaam cheekh or raham kii fariyaad ansuni kar di jaati he or us par tab tak pathar barasaaye jate hai, jab tak ek-ek chot se lahooluhaan ho kar wo behosh nahin ho jaati or phir uski jaan nahin chali jaati
 But it is also a matter of fact that the girl who was given such a terrible death sentence in this crime, her fiancée was just scolded by the terrorists in the same crime
 boko-haraam ne paar kii darindagi kii hadanaigeria main iesas ke nae sahyogi yani boko-haraam ne jo kiya he, wo or bhi khatarnaak he
 Here the terrorists set up a court, declared the accused guilty without trial and cut off their hands without delay
 is adaalat main is vakt swayambhu jaj bane aatankwaadiyon ke saamne ek aise jode ko pesh kiya gaya he, jis par chori kaa iljaam he or jinhen isi iljaam main is vakt naa sirf sajaa sunai jaani he
 Rather, punishment has to be given in front of everyone
 sajaa he ek hi jatke main us haath ko kaat kar alag kar dena, jis haath se koi cheez churaane kaa iljaam he
 Hearing about such punishment for theft is also difficult to believe but what to do? These terrorists and their laws are something like this
 donon muljimon ko sabake saamne baandh kar jameen par bithaate hi iesas kaa local commander mike tham letaa he or phir majahabi kaayade-kanoonon kaa hawala dete hue unke gunahon kii fehrist sunaane lagata he
 Since there is a large population surrounding the terrorists in this court at this time, these terrorists hang guns on their shoulders and do not forget to give lectures on issues like religion, jihad and crime
 udhar, chunki is ilaake ke logon ko bhi ye khabar he ki aanevaale vakt main is adaalat main jo kuch hone vaala he, wo behad ajeeb or chaunkaanewaala he
 Many people freeze their respective places to see the decision and the outcome
 pehle sajaa mukarrar phir kaat die haath
 
 
 Now the terrorist first explains the crime and then punishes the hands
 iske baad wo duusare aatankwaadiyon ko sajaa amal main laane kaa hukum detaa he or phir dekhte hi dekhte jode main ek yani chori ke iljaam main pakade gaye mard ko aatankwaadi jakad lete hai
 Since the sentence is already fixed in this court, the system of sentencing is also present here
 or ye he ek tejadhaar kulhadi or haath kaatane ke liye rakhaa gaya ped kaa ek tana
 The terrorists hold the hand of their victim and place it on top of that trunk, and as soon as a hint is received, the people close their eyes with a shudder, seeing what a terrorist does
 iesas kii ore se jari is video main aatankwaadiyon ne iske aage kii tasviren relies nahin kii hai
 But it is not difficult to understand how terrible and painful the scene is
 darasal, aatankwaadi haath tane ke upar rakh kar ek hi jatke main kulhadi se use kaat kar panja alag kar dete hai or phir kuch der tak use sabake saamne tadapane ke liye chhod diya jaataa he
 For a woman caught in the same charge, such punishment is even more frightening because she first sees the punishment she gets from her partner with her own eyes and after a while she has to undergo the same punishment
 kisi hoti he aatankwaadiyon kii picnic?insaanon kaa khun bahaanevaale dehshatgard aakhir picnic kaise manaate hai? jawaab sidhaa sa he
 
 
 By shedding the blood of the innocent
 al-kaayda ke rangaruton kaa nayaa video kuch aisa hi he
 In this, the old terrorists are not only instigating new recruits for jihad, but they are also becoming the cause of death for the lifeless animals by giving them free hunting in the jungles of Africa
 kahin khuleam jiraph ko dauda kar goli maarane kii aazaadee, kahin junglee bhainson ko nishaanaa banane kii chhot or kahin shikaar ke is silsile ke baad daavat kii taiyaari
 al-qaeda militants in the African country of Somalia are dreaming of rewarding and giving their recruits a similar reward for joining the jihad and following the path of terror
 al-kaayda kii somalian ikai yani harakat al shabaab kii in tasveeron ne jahaan puri duniya ko jaanwaron se saath hote is barbar saluk kii vajah se chaunkaa diya he, vahiin ye baat bhi sabit kar di he ki aatankwaadiyon kis tarah ab naujavaanon ko apane saath milaane ke liye unhen laalach dene kii shuruyaat kar di he
 In the wilderness of terrorists in the video, a terrorist in the video of Kenya and Somalia hunting jihadis this right of hunting in the jungles says that everything given by Allah is the right of the jihadis and anyone here to hunt and kill animals Can not stop khud al shabaab kii ore se jari is video main jahaan puraane aatankwaadi isi tarah nae rangaruton ko motivet karte najar aa rahe hai, vahiin un aatankwaadiyon se hamadardi bhi jataa rahe hai, jo faujee karrwai main maare gaye
 Just a year ago
 jab pehali baar duniya ne iesas kii darindagi dekhi thi
 ISEIS then released videos of their enemies beheading them
 phir kuch din baad logon ko pinjre main band kar jinda jala kar maarane laga
 Alam is that with each passing day, now he is becoming more cruel than before
 kab tak chalegaa ye silsilaa?iraq or syria main 21 agast 2014 se bandhakon ko maarane kaa jo silsilaa jari hua he wo aaj tak badastoor jari he
 In both these countries, the slaughter has been going on for the last 10 months
 laashon kii sahi ginati kaa kisi ko pataa nahin or koi ye bhi nahin bataa saktaa ki bagdadi ke belaag ho chuke aatankwaadi aakhir kab rukenge
 It is an everyday thing to find the bodies of humans on the scorching sands of the desert areas of both countries
 sawaal ab bhi vahi he ki aakhir ye video or begunaah logon ko maarane kaa silsla kab tak yun hi chalata rahegaa or aakhir kab tak iesas ke aatankwaadi duniya ko you hin dahalaate rahenge

 a shocking incident came to the fore in Lok Sabha on Wednesday
 sadan main america raashtrapati donald trump ke kashmir par vivaadit daawey ko lekar bahes chal rahi thi
 Defense Minister Rajnath Singh stood up for the government, but he took the name of his own minister wrong
 maamla isliye gambhir ho gaya kyonki anjaane yaa bhulvash koi ek yaa do baar galat naam legaa lekin rajnath singh ne chaar baar galat naam doharaaya
 The name was Foreign Minister S
 jaishankar kaa
 Rajnath Singh was heard four times as Jaishankar Prasad
 kashmir par donald trump ke bavaal machaane vaale bayaan par loksabhaa main jabardast hangaamaa chal rahaa tha
 The Leader of the Opposition stood in the House seeking answers from the Government
 congress duusare din bhi piem modi kii gheraabandi main lagi thi
 Was asking for a straight statement
 is maang par pradhanmantri narendra modi sadan main to nahin aae lekin raksha mantri rajnath singh ne sarkaar kaa paksh rakhaa
 In the statement, he strongly denied Trump's claim
 rajnath singh ne saaf-saaf kaha ki trump se kashmir par pradhanmantri kii koi baat nahin hui lekin bayaan dene ke dauraan raksha mantri se jubaani chook ho gai
 The country's defense minister made a mistake in his own foreign minister's address
 rajnath singh es
 Jaishankar Prasad spoke in place of Jaishankar
 jab raksha mantri naam kaa galat sambodhan kar rahe the to videsh mantri es jaishankar unke bagal main hi baithe the
 In such a situation, it would not be right to say that he is not aware of the name of the foreign minister, but sometimes mistakes are made inadvertently and when this happens in public life, then these mistakes also become public

 kuch baaten unase sidhi mulaakaat se judi hai, to kuch unke behad karibiyon dwaara sunai gayi, par ab jab kamaleshwar ke gaye hue bhi kaaphi vakt ho chukaa he, tab unase jude prank kaa ek kissa, jiskaa pratyakshdarshi main bhi tha, kaa zikr yahaan kar hi detaa hum
 a now well-established Hindi critic, journalist friend was a youth at that time, and was associated with a literary house magazine linked to a production house
 patrika ke sucharu prakaashan ko lekar main bhi yadakada unki sahaayta kar detaa
 It was not a mobile era, nor was the caller ID on the phone
 ek raat jab patrika ko relies karne kii taiyaariyaan joro par thi, achaanak mere mitra ko chuhal suujhi or unhone bhor ke chaar baje kamaleshwar ke ghar phone laga diya
 On hearing the bell for a long time, the voice of Kamleshwar's wife Gayatri Kamleshwar was heard from there
 vah hello boltin ki idhar se aalochak mitra ne achaanak british lahaze main angreji bolnaa shuru kar diya or kaha ki ‘main mistar kamaleshwar se baat karnaa chahta hum
 He is to be invited to a big literary event in London
 ’ gayatri kamaleshwar ne poocha, ‘abhi? raat ke is samay?’ unhen jawaab mila- ‘haa’
 Well after five minutes, he said to call again so that he could wake up Kamleshwar
 paanch minute baad jab phone hua to udhar se kamaleshwar ne hi phone uthaaya
 His first criticism was that 'what is this way of inviting someone? Don't they think it's not the right time? bharat main abhi bhor he’
 Here i got the answer, 'you yourself said that seven-eight years ago, while walking on the banks of the Thames, you get up at four in the morning
 ’ yah sunate hi kamaleshwar thodi der ke liye chup ho gaye
 Perhaps he tried to emphasize his memory
 par kuch bhi yaad na aane par phir se poocha, ‘kya subah jagane ke bare main khud maine aapse kaha tha?’ jawaab main ‘haa’ sunne par unka uttar tha, ‘nahin, aapako jarur sunne main koi galatfahami hui hogi
 i can't say that
 main to saat baje se pehle jagata hi nahin
 'we were listening to his voice on the speaker
 hamaari samuhik hansi chhuti, par usase pehle unka phone kaat diya tha
 Kamleshwar went away, but he never came to know about this prank
 darasal unka vyaktitv hi aisa tha ki chaahakar bhi unase ise ujagar karne kii himmat na hui
 Kamleshwar always lived like a king
 hindi ke duusare bahutayat lekhakon kii tarah unke paas paison kii dikkat kabhi na thi
 Professionally, he was a very successful writer and held a number of highly respected and well-paid positions for a long time
 vah doordarshan ke atirikt mahanideshak bhi rah chuke the
 Story and screenwriting for films and serials also paid him a lot of money
 upanyaas, kahani, naatak, sansmaran, patakatha jaisi vidha main kamaleshwar ne khub likhaa or bataur sampadak bhi khub charchit rahe
 He was the editor of several major newspapers and magazines
 kamaleshwar par sahitya academy ne ek dacumentry film bhi banaai thi
 His major works include Raja Nirbansiya, Lost Directions, Sixteen Terraced House
 charchit upanyaason main; ek sadak sattaavan galiyaan, teesraa aadmi, dak bangala, samudr main khoyaa hua aadmi, kaali aandhi, aagaamee ateet, subah

 The evening, the desert, the returned traveler, the same thing, another Chandrakanta and how many Pakistan is involved
 unke jin khaas kahani sangrahon ne pathakon ke dil main apni jagah banaai unamem; jorge pancham kii naak, maance kaa dariyaa, itane achche din, koharaa, katha-prasthaan, meri priy kahaniyaan shaamil hai
 In plays written by Kamleshwar; Incomplete voice, in names and memoirs written on sand; What i lived, the lamp of memories and the burning river also received a lot of appreciation from the readers
 kamaleshwar ne sau ke kareeb filmon ke samvaad, kahaniyaan yaa patakathaayen likhin
 Some of these famous films are Aandhi, Mausam, Rangbirangi, The Burning Train, Sautan, Ram Balaram, Sautan's daughter, Laila, Ye Desh, Rang Birangi, Sautan, Saajan Ki Saheli, etc
 unke dwaara doordarshan ke liye likhe gaye dharawahikon main chandrakanta, yug, vetaal pachisi, akaash ganga, ret par likhe naam aadi shaamil hai
 Kamleshwar received the Sahitya Akademi Award for 'kisane Pakistan'
 bharat sarkaar ne unhen padam bhushan se bhi sammanit kiya tha
 In the role of this book, he wrote, 'fifty-five and fifty years ago, the abstract oath that was ever taken that there is liberation in the creation itself, that little feeling of that liberation is now realized
 zindagi jeene, dayitvon ko sahane or rachana kii is behad yatra ke dauraan jo kabhi sochaa tha, sochataa rahaa tha ki ‘vam chirantan hai’ uski gahari pratiti bhi mujhe iske saath mili he
 'and finally with this third edition, the lines printed on the previous editions that-' In these closed rooms my breath is taken, when the windows open, there is poisonous air ', i now present my obeisance to the anonymous poet
 Let's put a little pause on these lines: Talk about the fun of some laughing noodles and some fuzzing with these matchsticks
 
 
 
 The literature of Kamleshwar is synonymous with this 'hasrte Parvaz'
 khaas baat yah ki kitne pakistan ke aath sanskarnon kii bhoomika khud unhone hi likhi thi
 Tribute to literature Aaj Tak! mexico ke chidyaghar main aisi ghatana hui,jisko dekhakar aap bhi hans-hanskar lot-pot ho jaaenge
 In Mexico's Ecological Park, a bear climbed over the woman and rubbed her hair

 After which the hair started caressing

 aakhirkaar sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr samaapt ho gaya
 In terms of functioning, 102 percent in the Lok Sabha and 46 percent in the Rajya Sabha
 vahiin loksabhaa main 87 phisadi prashnkaal hua to rajyasabha main mahaj 14 fisadi
 a total of nine bills were passed in both the houses
 loksabhaa main chah or bill paas hue
 The ten crore rupees of the government were wasted due to non-functioning of Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main 112 ghante kaam hona tha, lekin 55 ghante hangaame kii vajah se barbaad ho gaye
 The special thing of the session was that the Lok Sabha had more work than the Rajya Sabha for the last four sessions
 rajyasabha ne bill ke bahes main kam vakt diya or chah bill to bina bahes ke paas kar die gaye
 During the Question Hour, 14 Ministers did not respond to the starred question
 vaise to sheetakaaleen satr main 14 bill pesh kiye jane the lekin aath hi pesh hue
 Not only this, there were plans to pass 20 bills but only eight happened
 satr kii khaas baat rahi ki pichley chaar satr se loksabhaa main rajyasabha kii tulana main zyada kaam hua
 The Rajya Sabha gave less time to debate the bill and six bills were passed without debate
 prashnkaal ke dauraan 14 mantriyon ne tarankit sawaal kaa jabaab bolkar nahin die
 Although 14 bills were to be introduced in the winter session but only eight were introduced
 itnaa hi nahin 20 bill paas karaane kii yojana thi par hue keval aath hi
 When your father asked him the reason for his arrival, Naradji said- 'O Giriraj! i have come here after sending Lord Vishnu
 aapaki kanya kii ghor tapasya se prasann hokar vah usase vivaah karnaa chaahate hai
 i want to know your opinion about this
 ' naradji kii baat sunakar parvataraaj ati prasannataa ke saath bole- he naradji! yadi swayan bhagwaan vishnu meri kanya se vivaah karnaa chaahate hai to isse badi koi baat nahin ho sakati
 i am ready for this marriage
 ' Shivji says to Parvati ji, 'naradji, after getting the approval of your father, went to Vishnu and told this good news
 lekin jab tumhen is vivaah ke bare main pataa chalaa to tumhen bahut dukh hua
 You, ie Kailashpati Shiva, had considered me your husband by heart
 tumne apane vyakul man kii baat apni saheli ko bataai
 Your friend suggested that she will hide you by taking you to a dense forest and do the meditation to get Shiva there
 iske baad tumhaare pita tumhen ghar main na paakar bade chintit or duhkhi hue
 He started thinking that what would happen if Vishnu brought a procession and you did not meet him at home? They made you search the earth, but you could not be found
 tum van main ek gupha ke bheetar meri aradhana main leen thi
 You worshiped Shravan III Shukla by constructing a Shiva lingam from the sand that i fulfilled your wish by being happy
 iske baad tumne apane pita se kaha, 'pitaaji! maine apane jivan kaa lanbaa samay bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya main bitaayaa he or bhagwaan shiv ne meri tapasya se prasann hokar mujhe sweekaar bhi kar liya he
 Now i will walk with you on the same condition that you will marry me with Lord Shiva only
 ' parvat raaj ne tumhaari ichha sweekaar kar lee or tumhen ghar waapas le gaye
 After some time, he married us with complete law
 'tippaniyan Lord Shiva said after this, 'O Parvati! Shravan Shukla Tritiya, the fast you performed by worshiping me, resulted in the marriage of both of us
 is vrath kaa mahatv yah he ki main is vrath ko purna nishtha se karne vaali prayek stri ko man vaanchit fal detaa hum
 ' bhagwaan shiv ne parvati ji se kaha ki is vrath ko jo bhi stri purna shraddha se karengi use tumhaari tarah achal suhaag praapt hoga

 After this, your father was very worried and sad about not finding you at home
 vah sochane lage ki yadi vishnuji baraat lekar aa gaye or tum ghar par naa mili to kya hoga? unhone tumhaari khoj main dharti-pataal ek karvaa die lekin tum naa mili
 You were absorbed in my worship inside a cave in the forest

 After this you told your father, 'father! i have spent a long time of my life in the penance of Lord Shiva and Lord Shiva has accepted me by being pleased with my penance

 The importance of this fast is that i give the desired fruit to every woman who observes this fast with full devotion
