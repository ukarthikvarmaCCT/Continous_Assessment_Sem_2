kaha
 i saw good evening listening to Babuji a little bit surprised, then immediately there was a slight smile on his face, which was very dear
 main samaj gaya ki ve prabhavit ho chuke hai
 i used to stick with my mother, i was not getting close to my mother so that she would know that i have become independent
 maa ne apni snehasikt muskaan se mujhe chuaa, main maa se lipatana chahta tha kintu jagah par khadey-khadey muskuraakar apane aatmanirbhar hone kaa unhen saboot diya
 Mother looked at Babuji and smiled, i understand that she was impressed
 maa, babuji, bhayeeji or ham teenon bhai haul ke ek kone main baith baaten karne lage
 We were asked for a full week's details, and 6
 30 baje ke lagbhag babuji ne hamase kaha ki apana saamaan pack karo, tum logon ko gadervaara waapas chalanaa he, vahiin aage kii padhai hogi
 We looked at Achachacha's mother
 maa babuji ke samarthan main dikhaai deen
 We had the freedom to ask questions in our house, according to the rule of the house, the little ones had the right to speak first, so according to the rules, the first question i asked was the reason for taking back Babuji to Gadarwara? He said, Ranaji, i want to make you a good person, not just a good student
 tum logon ko yahaan nayaa seekhney bheja tha, purana bhuulane nahin
 If a new one forgets the old one, then the auspiciousness of that new one comes under doubt
 hamaare ghar main har chota apane se bade parijan, parichit,aparichit jo bhi uske sampark main aata he, uske charan sparsh kar apana sammaan nivedit karata he
 But saw that this new environment, in just seven days, left my children familiar and taught my parents to say good evening instead of touch the stage
 main nahin kahata ki is abhivadan main sammaan nahin he, kintu charan sparsh karne main sammaan hota he, yah main vishwaas se kah saktaa hum
 Knowledge is not meant to make a person sensitive, but is not meant to make one sensitive
 maine dekha tum apni maa se lipatana chaahate the lekin tum dur hi khadey rahe, vidya dur khadey vyakti ke paas jane kaa hunar detii he na ki apane se jude hue se dur karne kaa kaam karti he
 Today i understood the difference between school and school, the school that gives education to a person, the school that only makes him literate, i do not want my children to be literate and be burdened with degrees
 main apane bacchon ko shikshit kar dard ko samajhane uske boj ko halkaa karne kaa maharath dena chahta hum
 i sent you to learn the English language, not to forget the intimate feeling
 samvedanheen sakshar hone se kahin acha samvedansheel nirakshar hona he
 So tie the bed and go home
 ham teenon bhai turant maa-babuji ke charnon main gir gaye
 They picked us up and hugged us
 
 And thank you for being like yourself, not like anyone else
 
 
 tippaniyan Whenever Pujya Babuji is tired or standing on the verge of defeat, this blessing of yours "be like no one else but yourself" Be a lifelike person, by communicating new energy and fills the heart with enthusiasm

 Ashutosh Rana's post on Facebook, which he shared on his late father's birthday, is being published here
 baat sattar ke dashak kii he jab hamaare poojya pitaaji ne hamaare bade bhai madanamohan jo rabertson college jabalpur se emessi kar rahe the, kii salaah par ham teen bhaaiyon ko behatar shiksha ke liye gadervaara ke kasbaai vidhyalay se uthaakar jabalpur shahar ke christ carch skool main daakhila kara diya
 Christ Church School in Mahakaushal zone of Madhya Pradesh was at the top among English medium schools at that time
 poojya babuji va maa ham teenon bhaaiyon ( nandkumar, jayant, va main ashutosh ) kaa christchurch main daakhila kara hamen hostel main chhodke agle ravivaar ko punah milane kaa aashwaasan deke waapas chale gaye
 i did not know that the sun is going to be marked in my life forever
 itvaar kaa matlab chuttee hota he lekin sattar ke dashak kaa vah itvaar mere jivan kii chuttee nahin "ghutti" ban gaya
 i was delighted since Sunday morning, these were the first seven days of my life when i stayed out of my house without mother Babuji
 man mishrit bhaavon se bharaa hua tha, hriday ke kisi kone main maa, babuji ko impress karne kaa bhav balwati ho rahaa tha, yahi vah din tha jab mujhe prem or prabhaav ke bich kaa antar samaj aayaa
 Children not only want to get love from their parents, they also want to impress them
 dopaher 3
 At 30 we arrived in the visiting room of the hostel
 green blager, white pant, white shart, green and white strib vaali taai or bata ke blike noti boy shoes, yah hamaari skool uniform thi
 We saw our military green color open Ford Jeep coming in from the main gate in the school campus through the visiting room window, which my elder brother Mohan, who was called the whole house brother, was driving, and mother Babuji was sitting
 
 main behad utsahit tha mujhe apane par purna vishwaas tha ki aaj in donon ko impress kar hi luungaa
 i asked Jayant Bhaiya, who is six years older than me, to confirm - how am i feeling? He used to love me unconditionally, was protective about me, said - You look fantastic
 nand bhaiya ne unki baat kaa anumodan kar mere hausale ko or badha diya
 The jeep stopped
 
 The mother in a reverse orange golden orange sari and Babuji descended from her in a white dhoti-kurta Gandhi cap and black Jawahar bundi
 ham daudkar unase nahin mil sakate the
 This was against the school rules, so in the meeting hall as the soldier stands alert in the posture of relaxation, the three brothers standing in a line waiting to reach the mother-babuji
 jaise hi ve kareeb aae, ham teenon bhaaiyon ne sammilit swar main apni jagah par khadey-khadey Good evening Mummy
 Good evening Babuji
 kaha
 i saw good evening listening to Babuji a little bit surprised, then immediately there was a slight smile on his face, which was very dear
 main samaj gaya ki ve prabhavit ho chuke hai
 i used to stick with my mother, i was not getting close to my mother so that she would know that i have become independent
 maa ne apni snehasikt muskaan se mujhe chuaa, main maa se lipatana chahta tha kintu jagah par khadey-khadey muskuraakar apane aatmanirbhar hone kaa unhen saboot diya
 Mother looked at Babuji and smiled, i understand that she was impressed
 maa, babuji, bhayeeji or ham teenon bhai haul ke ek kone main baith baaten karne lage
 We were asked for a full week's details, and 6
 30 baje ke lagbhag babuji ne hamase kaha ki apana saamaan pack karo, tum logon ko gadervaara waapas chalanaa he, vahiin aage kii padhai hogi
 We looked at Achachacha's mother
 maa babuji ke samarthan main dikhaai deen
 We had the freedom to ask questions in our house, according to the rule of the house, the little ones had the right to speak first, so according to the rules, the first question i asked was the reason for taking back Babuji to Gadarwara?

 maine dekha tum apni maa se lipatana chaahate the lekin tum dur hi khadey rahe, vidya dur khadey vyakti ke paas jane kaa hunar detii he na ki apane se jude hue se dur karne kaa kaam karti he
 Today i understood the difference between school and school, the school that gives education to a person, the school that only makes him literate, i do not want my children to be literate and be burdened with degrees
 main apane bacchon ko shikshit kar dard ko samajhane uske boj ko halkaa karne kaa maharath dena chahta hum
 i sent you to learn the English language, not to forget the intimate feeling
 samvedanheen sakshar hone se kahin acha samvedansheel nirakshar hona he
 So tie the bed and go home
 ham teenon bhai turant maa-babuji ke charnon main gir gaye
 They picked us up and hugged us
 
 And thank you for being like yourself, not like anyone else

 It was in the seventies when on the advice of our eldest father Madan Mohan, who was doing his msc from Robertson College Jabalpur, we picked up three brothers from the town school of Gadarwara for better education and enrolled in Christ Church School in Jabalpur city Got it done
 madhya pradesh ke mahakaushal anchal main christ carch skool us samay angreji madhyam ke vidyalayon main apane sheersh par tha
 Pujya Babuji and mother went back to the three of us brothers (nandkumar, Jayant, and i Ashutosh) after getting admission in Christchurch, leaving us in the hostel and promising to meet again next Sunday
 mujhe nahin pataa tha ki jo itvaar aane vaala he vah mere jivan main sadaa ke liye chinhit hone vaala he
 Sunday means a holiday, but that Sunday in the seventies became a "chhoti", not a holiday of my life
 itvaar kii subah se hi main aahlaadit tha, ye mere jivan ke pehle saat din the jab main bina maa babuji ke apane ghar se baahar rahaa tha
 The mind was filled with mixed emotions, the feeling of impressing the mother, Babuji in any corner of the heart was strengthening, this was the day when i understood the difference between love and influence
 bachche apane mata-pita se sirf prem hi paanaa nahin chaahate, ve unhen prabhavit bhi karnaa chaahate hai
 3 in the afternoon
 30 baje ham hostel ke visiting room main aa gaye
 Green blazer, white pants, white shirt, green and white striped tie and Bata's Black Naughty Boy Shoes, this was our school uniform
 hamane visiting room kii khidki se skool ke campus main main get se hamaari miletry green color kii open ford jeep ko andar aate hue dekha, jise mere bade bhai mohan, jinhen puraa ghar bhayeeji kahata tha drive kar rahe the,or maa babuji baithe hue the
 i was very excited that i had full faith in myself that i will impress them both today
 maine pushti karne ke liye jayant bhaiya, jo mujhase chah varsh bade hai, se poocha - main kaisaa lag rahaa hum? ve mujhase ashart prem karte the, mujhe lekar protective bhi the, bole - shandaar lag rahe ho
 Nand Bhaiya approved his words and further boosted my spirits
 jeep rukii
 
 ulate palle kii golden orange sari main maa or jhakk safed dhoti-kurta gandhi topi or kaali jawahar bandi main babuji usase utre
 We could not run and meet him
 yah skool ke niyamon ke khilaaf tha, so meeting haul main jaise sainik vishram kii mudra main alert khadaa rahata he, ek line main teenon bhai khadey maa-babuji ke paas pahunchane kaa intjaar karne lage
 As they came closer, the three of us brothers stood together in their voices in good voice
 Good evening Babuji
 said
 maine dekha good evening sunke babuji halkaa sa chaunke phir turant hi unke chahare par halki smit ai jisamen behad laad tha
 i understand that they have been impressed
 main jo maa se lipta hi rahata tha, maa ke kareeb nahin ja rahaa tha taaki unhen pataa chale kii main independent ho gaya hum
 The mother touched me with her affectionate smile, i wanted to cling to my mother, but smiled standing on the spot and gave her proof of my self-reliance
 maa ne babuji ko dekha or muskura deen, main samaj gaya ki ve prabhavit ho gai hai
 Mother, Babuji, Bhaiji and the three of us sat talking in one corner of the hall
 hamase puure hafte kaa vivaran maanga gaya, or 6
 Around 30 o'clock Babuji told us to pack your things, you guys have to go back to Gadarwara, where you will study further
 hamane achakachaa ke maa kii taraf dekha
 The mother appeared in support of Babuji
 hamaare ghar main prashn poochne kii aazaadee thi ghar ke niyam ke mutabik chhoton ko pehle apni baat rakhane kaa adhikaar tha, so niyamanusaar pehla sawaal maine daaga or babuji se gadervaara waapas le jane kaa kaaran poocha? unhone kaha ranaji main tumhen maatr acha vidhyaarthee nahin ek acha vyakti bananaa chahta hum
 You were sent here to learn new, not forget old
 koi nayaa yadi puraane ko bhula de to us nae kii shubhta andeh ke daayre main aa jaati he
 Every little person in our house, his elder, familiar, unfamiliar who comes in contact with him, invites his respect by touching his feet
 lekin dekha ki is nae vaataavaran ne maatr saat dinon main hi mere bacchon ko parichit chodo apane mata-pita se hi charan sparsh kii jagah Good evening kahana sikhaa diya
 i do not say that there is no respect in this greeting, but there is respect in touching the feet, i can say it with confidence
 vidya vyakti ko samvedansheel banane ke liye hoti he samvedanheen banane ke liye nahin hoti
 i saw that you wanted to cling to your mother, but you stood far away, Vidya gives the skill to go to the person standing far away and not to work away from herself
 aaj mujhe vidhyalay or skool kaa antar samaj aayaa, vyakti ko jo shiksha de vah vidhyalay, jo use sirf sakshar banaae vah skool, main nahin chahta ki mere bachche sirf sakshar hoke digriyon ke boj se dab jaaen
 i want to educate my children and understand the pain and lighten their burden
 maine tumhen angreji bhashaa seekhney ke liye bheja tha athmiya bhav bhuulane ke liye nahin
 Better to be illiterate than to be insensitive literate
 isliye bistar bandho or ghar chalo
 All three of us fell immediately at the feet of maa-babuji
 unhone hamen uthaakar gale se laga liya
 
 va shubhashirwad diya ki kisi or ke jaise nahin swayan ke jaise bano
 
 
 The comments poojya babuji jab bhi kabhi thaktaa hum yaa haar kii kagaar par khadaa hota hum to aapkaa yah aashirwad "kisi or ke jaise nahin swayan ke jaise bano" sanjivani ban nav urja kaa sanchaar kar hriday ko utsaah ullas se bhar detaa he 
 Best regards to you

 jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne kaha he ki naa to vah pradhanmantri banane kii daud main hai or naa hi badi kursi kaa koi sapana dekhte hai
 Without naming Modi and Rahul Gandhi, Omar said that only those who are sitting on the dream of this, remain in this race
 jammu main dasvin or barahavin kii parikshaon main awwal rahe chaatr-chaatraon ke sammaan samaaroh main bacchon ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne kaha ki unhone abhi tak pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana nahin dekha he
 At present, they have not even cut the ticket for it
 jab ek chaatr dwaara yah poocha gaya ki agar unhen piem ummidavaar niyukt kiya jaataa he to kya vah is pad ko sweekaar karenge
 On this, Omar said that let only those who are dreaming of it see, but would like to work in the state right now
 jammu kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdullah ne kaha, ' main maafee chahta hoon, line main kaaphi log khadey hai
 People have given a chance to work
 maine sirf jammu-kashmir ko thik karne kaa khwab dekha he
 At the same time, when a student tried to learn from the Chief Minister that when the situation was bad in Kishtwar, why was BJP leader Arun Jaitley stopped from going there
 is par umr abdulla ne sawaal karte hue poocha ki arun jetali mujffarnagar kyunnahin gaye
 Why did he only want to go to Kishtwar
 umr ne kaha ki unhone 2008 ke amarnath andolan or 2010 main kashmir ghati kii hinsa dekhi he
 Omar Abdullah also said that he is not going to leave the field of politics in the state right now and wants the public to give him more opportunity
 chhattisgarh (chhattisgarh Election Result ) vidhansabha ke liye matganana jari he
 Voting was held in two phases on November 12 and 20
 chhattisgarh vidhansabha kii 90 vidhansabha siton par 76
 Voting is 3 percent
 chhattisgarh main congress or bijepi ke bich sidhi takkar he

 After saying the Supreme Court about the theft of highly confidential documents of the Rafael Deal, it has now been clarified after sensation and misbehavior of the government worldwide
 maamle ko lekar lipapoti kaa daur bhi shuru ho gaya he
 Rafael Ladaku, the Central Government Attorney General, KK Venugopal, has overturned what he said in open court about the documents related to the process of the plane deal
 isamen venugopal ne mana ki dastavej chori nahin hue hai, balki li hue hai
 This is a case of illegally leaking files
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko rafel deal ko lekar atorni general venugopal ne chif justise ranjan gogoi kii aguwai vaali peeth ke samaksh dastavejon ke chori hone kii baat kahi thi
 He had said during the hearing on the review petition of the Rafael judgment that the documents cited by Prashant Bhushan, Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie were based on the stolen documents
 kyonki inhen dastavejon ke aadhaar par kuch akhabaaron or news agenciyon ne khabaren chalaai thi
 After the statement of the Attorney General, the court had fired many questions, after sensational information, Chief Justice Gogoi himself had asked that Mr
 Attorney while breaking the silence in the top court
 
 
 
 When did this article appear in the media? In response, the Attorney General said that My Lord on 8 February
 court ne phir prashn kiya tha ki tab se ab tak lagbhag ek maheene kaa samay biit chukaa he
 What action did you take in this matter? On this question, the Attorney General said that the investigation is still underway
 iske baad supreme court ne atorni general venugopal se jawaab talab kar liya tha
 Opposition parties fiercely surrounded the Modi government and after this, there was talk of theft of documents of Rafael Deal from media to street and street
 isko lekar vipakshi dalon ne bhi modi sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi had targeted the Modi government over the theft of such sensitive documents of the Rafael Deal from the Ministry of Defense and demanded an inquiry into the matter
 soshal media par bhi sarkaar kii bakhiya udhedi jane lagi
 At the same time, on the attack by opposition parties, Venugopal said, 'I was told that the opposition has alleged that the government argued in the Supreme Court that the files of Rafael Deal have been stolen from the Ministry of Defense
 yah puri tarah se galat he
 The statement that the files have been stolen is completely false
 ’adhikariyon kii laaparvaahee se li hue dastavejisake baad do din main atorni general apane bayaan se palate or kaha ki rafel saude se judi prakriya ke sabhi mul dastavej file main maujuud hai, lekin media main jis tarah se unako dikhaaya gaya or unhen saarvajanik kiya gaya, use dekhte hue ye saaf he ki mul dastavejon kii photo copy karai gai yaa photo khinchi gai he
 Due to the negligence of the officials, important documents of the files of Rafael Deal have been leaked
 unhone kaha ki ye offis sikret act kaa ulanghan he
 The government will take action against the responsible officials after the investigation
 isaki soochna bhi court ko di jaaegi
 At the same time, official sources say that the use of the word 'theft' by the Attorney General was 'more strict'
 isse bachaa ja saktaa tha

 The mp's wife has sought to find him and the police is also in a dilemma about the circumstances under which they should file a case and how to find Kalu
 haalanki police adheekshak ke nirdesh ke baad police kute ko yudhstar par khoj rahi he
 However, it is no surprise now that the police of the largest province of our country is ready only for the affluent and indifferent towards the common people, that is why Uttar Pradesh is becoming the best state

 There is no clear evidence of the construction of this Hanuman temple of Ramkal, but it is said that how many times Ayodhya is inhabited and destroyed, but still a place which has always remained in its original form is the Hanuman mound which today is named after Hanuman Garhi Is famous for is tile tak pahunchane ke liye bhakton ko 76 seedhiyaan paar kerani padati hai
 After this, a 6-inch statue of Pavanputra Hanuman is seen, which is always beautified with flower-garlands
 anjaniputra kii mahima se paripurna hanuman chalisa kii chaoupaaiyaan hriday ke saath-saath mandir kii deevaaron par sushobhit hai
 It is said that the importance of this divine place of Hanuman ji was not tied to any particular religion, but whoever asked for a wish here, Hanuman Lala gave it to him
 tabhi to apane iklaute putr ke praanon kii raksha hone par avadh ke nawab mansoor ali ne is mandir kaa jirnonddhaar karaayaa
 It is said that once the son of Nawaba fell very ill
 putr ke praan bachane ke koi asaar na dekhakar nawab ne bajrangbali ke charnon main maathaa tech diya
 Sankatmochan returned the life of the son of the Nawab, after which the Nawab not only renovated the Hanuman Garhi temple but also wrote on the casket that it declared that no king or ruler would ever have any authority over this temple nor here
 No tax will be collected from the offerings of lanka vijay ke baad ayodhya main isi sthaan par bhagwaan shri ram ne hanuman ko rahane kaa sthaan diya jo aaj hanuman gadhi kehalaata he or hanuman gadhi hi ayodhya kii suraksha gadhi bhi kahi jaati thi
 Where even today, the birthday of Sankatmochan is celebrated at midnight on the day of Chhoti Diwali
 pavanputra ke janm diwas kaa sakshi bananaa har bhakt ke liye saubhaahgya kii baat hoti he
 There is a conch shell at twelve o'clock in the middle of colorful jhalers and flickering lamps, and the whole sky is illuminated with light
 bhakt sudhabudh khokar is harsh-ullas ko apane main samet lenaa chaahate hai
 It is believed that the troubleshooter Hanuman was born at midnight of this festival of lights and that is why devotees reach Ayodhya from every corner of the country on Deepawali every year
 lanka se vijay ke pratik rup main laae gaye nishaan bhi isi gadhi main rakhe gaye jo aaj bhi khaas maukey par baahar nikaale jate hai or jagah-jagah par unki puja-archana kii jaati he
 The color filled Ekadashi just before Holi is one of those special days when these marks are taken out and devotees worship them and celebrate their joy
 yaheen se sadhu santon kii holi ke saath deshbhar main holi kii shuruyaat hoti he
 The special time of worship and darshan of Hanuman Lala is fixed here
 kehete hai vishesh muhoort main pavanputra kii aradhana se bhakton kii har muraad puri hoti he
 Devotees coming from all over the world to keep themselves overwhelmed by the glory of Hanuman ji, keep on getting here and Pawanputra diagnoses all the sufferings of his devotees by bowing his head in this court of Hanuman Lala in true mind

 duniya ke sabase khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan ke sargana bagdadi ke kai baar kamjor hone kii khabar ai
 But this time his condition is really bad
 naa sirf chaar-chaar deshon main uske aatanki thikaane nestnabud ho rahe hai, balki kachche tel or vasuuli se hone vaali uski kamai main bhayankar giravat ai he
 Baghdadi would have been able to get out of this that the coalition army has broken its back by attacking from all four sides
 apane aatank se jo kal tak duniya ko rulaayaa karte the
 Those who used to cut off the heads of innocents without talking
 jo bagaiyr kisi jurm ke logon ko phenk diya karte the
 Who used to burn humans alive
 jo logon ko jite ji dubo kar maar daalate the
 Baghdadi and her terrorists, the biggest dealers of terror, are sitting on their necks on bad days
 mosul main sabase bada hamalaa iskaa saboot he
 Baghdadi is scared by these four things- It is not possible to escape this time: Baghdadi has been running away for the last one and a half years
 ye haal tab tha, jab uske aatankiyon kii tuuti bolti thi
 Governments from Iraq to Libya and from Syria to Turkey were surrendered before him
 lekin ab to apane aatank kii rajdhani main maare jane ke had tak ghir gaya he
 He must have realized that it is no longer easy for him to save himself
 uske aatank kaa samrajya iraq main hi sikudta gaya he
 2- Many areas left hand: The Iraqi army wiped out IS in cities such as Ramadi, Tiraqit and Fazullah before entering Mosul
 vahi karakosh, hamaam al aleel, khajer, kuwair or tal afra jaise shaharon main bagdadi ke aatanki aakhri ghadiyaan gin rahe hai
 On the very first day of October 17, the army liberated an area of 200 km near Mosul
 iske baad chaar din ke andar bartela main 100 aatanki maare gaye
 3- Oil wells and collection earnings fell by 30%: Baghdadi took advantage of the anarchy of the Gulf countries and captured the oil wells
 lekin ab haalat itani kharaab ho gai he ki wo apane aatankiyon ko tankhwaah tak nahin de paa rahaa he
 The terrorists were running away from it
 is par iraqi sena kaa hamalaa itnaa tej hua ki bagdadi ke aatanki to burke main bhi bhaagane lage
 This is the second thing that he did not get success
 4- koun banegaa uske aatank kaa khalipha:ye baat to bagdadi bhi jaanata he ki jaise hi uske halak se jaan niklegi, iesas kaa aatank bhi bemaut maaraa jayega
 Baghdadi, who dreams of making himself the Khalifa of the Islamic State, cannot even think who will become the Khalifa of terror after that
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki agar koi khalipha ban bhi gaya to bhi wo aies ko barbaad hone se bachaa nahin saktaa he

 There was also the challenge of connecting the story with the present

 ’’ glamer kaa mahatv is baat se samajha ja saktaa he ki mahadev kii sati ne khub surkhiyaan batorin
 There is a large number of women in the viewers of these serials, due to which the makers have special emphasis on styling

 Of course we are allowed to follow religion

 "religion is considered personal, so analysts do not consider it right to make it public
" visheshgyon ke apane mat ho sakate hai lekin darshak routine se alag kuch chaahate hai
 That is why reality shows on TV sometimes show their feats and sometimes religious serials

 In the opinion of Shiv Sagar of Sagar Arts, "parents want their children to see these serials and learn good things
" yah darshakon kii chahat hi hoti he ki in kairactors ko baar-baar alag-alag dhang se pesh kiya jaataa he
 "if we look at all the aspects, then it comes out that the channels are creating stories that inspire common people and make some changes in their lives

 "increasing wealth in the circle of questions, Suhail says that when Ahmed Bukhari's father was Imam in 1976, he got just Rs 179
 tankhwaah milti thi
 However they owe Bukhari assets now worth thousands of crores
 kii hone kaa daawa karte hai, lekin isaki pushti ke liye unke paas koi thos saboot nahin he
 He has demanded from the High Court that where Bukhari's property came from, it should be investigated
 unka aarope he ki bukhari kii sampatti na sirf hindustan main faili he, balki makka-madina tak inke hotel or vyapaar faile hue hai
 a close friend of the Bukhari family tells of his pride, "he himself drives in a Prado car, sons have Mercedes and other big cars
" ’’ india today ne imam bukhari se unke khilaaf lage aaropon ke bare main baat karne kaa prayaas kiya lekin unhone is bare main kuch bhi bolne se saaf inkaar kar diya
 The accounts of the mosque's property do not account for Masjid's income, often leading to a confrontation between the Waqf Board and the Shahi Imam
 lekin sawaal uthta he ki jama masjid ko hone vaali aamadani kaa aakhir kya hota he? matin ahamed kehete hai, ‘‘sampatti to vakf board kii he, lekin dekharekh imam bukhari hi karte hai
 In order to be Waqf's property, the board should get 7% of the revenue
 lekin miltaa nahin he
 While both social activists Fahmi and Suhail claim that the daily income of the mosque is about 3, including the income from tourists and the recovery from illegal parking, etc
 5 se 4 lakh ru
 Has vahaan koi bhi parchi vakf board ke naam se nahin katati
 In the past year, there has been a conflict between the Imam and the Board regarding the electricity bill
 tab bukhari ne yah kah diya ki agar masjid unke naam se kar di jaae to ve 4
 16 crores Rs
 kaa bijli bill chukaa denge
 The encroachment led to mosques in Jehanabad or Old Delhi, where Numa or Jama Masjid was built by Shah Jahan
 ahamed bukhari ke purvaj badshahath ke daur main shahi imam kehalaate the
 Despite the end of kingship and English rule and the coming of democracy in the country, the practice of imposing "shahi" before the Imam remained
 lekin masjid ke irdagird ke halaat par shaayad ‘‘shahi’’ imam kaa koi kaabo nahin he
 Local MLA Shueb Iqbal says, "the condition of Meena Bazaar place near Shahi Gate is very bad
 jitne ajeebogareeb kism ke krime hote hai, sab yahi hote hai
 The police have a big hand in this
 ’’ imam ke chote bhai yahya bukhari bhi kah chuke hai, ‘‘masjid ke aasapaas duniya bhar ke nazaij kaam ho rahe hai
 There is no security for the mosque
 koi bhi dehshatgard masjid ko aasaani se nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 "in the face of ineffective Fatvejama mosque, more than its religious identity, it has become in the news due to political fatwas and the current Imams are breaking records in giving political fatwa
 rajyasabha saansad choudhary munwwar saleem kehete hai, ‘‘imam kaa kaam majahabi nukta-e-najar main namaaj padhaanaa he, lekin bukhari shaayad hindustaan ke tanha imam hai jo siyaasi fatve bhi jari karte hai
 Their edicts are always under political interests
 kabhi bijepi, kabhi congress, kabhi espi to kabhi bispi, hindustan kaa aisa koi dal nahin jiske paksh main bukhari ne fatwa jari na kiya ho
 "congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh Bukhari has been described as" a person with communal leanings "
 unhone kaha tha, ‘‘bukhari vahi vyakti he jinhone osama bin laden kaa saraahaa or uski hatya par virodh jataayaa or 2004 main bijepi ke paksh main fatwa diya
 In the 2012 UP Assembly elections, Imam Bukhari issued a fatwa in favor of SP, but his son-in-law Omar's bail was forfeited from Behat seat
 lekin is haar ke baad bhi apni imamat ke rutabe kaa dabaav banaakar bukhari ne damaad ko uttar pradesh vidhaan parishad kaa sadsy or apane dost haji munna ke bete wasim ko rajya pradooshan niyantran board kaa chairman banwaaya
 "bukhari made 20 rounds of Mulayam Singh Yadav to make the son-in-law MLC and Wasim Ahmed Khan the board chairman," says a close man associated with the Bukhari family
 ’’ lekin jab wasim ko board se hataa diya gaya to bukhari ne mulaayam ke grih ilaake itawa main raily kar phir muslim virdohi bataanaa shuru kar diya, taaki ‘‘phir koi saudebaaji ho jaae
 "far away from the Muslims of the country, the Jama Masjid area of bukhari does not seem to have a special hold even among the Muslims
" shueb ikbaal imam bukhari ke virodh ke baavjood pichley 20 saal se janata kii numaaindgi kar rahe hai
 Iqbal, an MLA from the Mattiamhal Assembly seat, also contested the 1998 Lok Sabha election, in which he received around 70,000 votes, but in the 1999 election the next year he joined hands with Ahmed Bukhari
 lekin hairat kii baat rahi ki shueb kaa vot badaae ke bajaae kareeb 12,000 vot kam ho gaye
 So now they keep their distance from Bukhari
 puche jane par ve kehete hai, ‘‘ek-do martabaa mere khilaaf bhi fatwa kiya he, lekin awam apane tareeke se faisle leti he
 Azam Khan, a senior minister in the UP government, says in a hilarious tone, "these people cannot live in the area where a councilor lives
" saamne vaala inaki chaati par chadhakar vidhayak banataa he
 How much of their hold on the Muslims, what will be a great example of this, that their son-in-law could not save the bail in Uttar Pradesh, where seat number one is the highest number of Muslims
 ’’musalamaanon ke shubhachintak yaa shoshak?islam dharm main bukhari parivaar kii khaas ahmiyat he, isliye shahjahan ne bukhaara (uzbekistan) se is parivaar ko bulawaaya tha
 But Bukhari issued a fatwa for the BJP even after the Gujarat riots
 ayodhya masale par hycourt ke faisle ke baad lakhanu kii ek press conference main ek urdu akhbaar ke patrkaar mo
 When Abdul Wahid Chishti asked the question, Bukhari was enraged and rushed to kill him
 had to tab ho gai jab bukhari ne sapa se rajyasabha ke liye chune gaye saat main se ekmaatr muslim saansad choudhary munwwar saleem ko lula-langadaa, andhaa kaha
 Imam Bukhari's story does not seem to end here
 aadat ke mutabik ve har aise mudde par bayaan dete hai, jiskaa majahab se koi sarokaar nahin
 When the Delhi gang-rape victim was struggling with death, then the UP government announced to bear all the medical expenses, it also did not appeal to Bukhari
 ise bhi unhone majahab se jod chintaa jataa di ki is tarah kii sahaayta kabhi kisi muslim balaatkaar peedita ko nahin di gai
 His attempt to promote a dangerous communalism was not only seen in the rape victim's case, but he also appealed to the community to stay away from Anna Hazare's movement against corruption as anti-muslim
 22 agast, 2011 ko unhone kaha tha ki andolan main vande maataram or bharat mata kii jai (urdu main maadare vatan ko salaam) ke naare lag rahe hai, jo islam ke viruddh he
 At that time, Bukhari alleged that the lawyers involved in Team Anna have been defending Narendra Modi's role in the Gujarat riots
 lekin yahaan bukhari yah bhul gaye ki dangon ke baad 2004 main unhone usee bijepi ke liye fatwa jari kiya tha
 His habit of confronting the administration is not new
 endie shasankaal main may 2003 main tatkaaleen paryaton va samskruti mantri jagmohan ne jama masjid kshetra main atikaraman hataane kii pahal kii thi to imam ne dhamkee bhari chitthee likh jagmohan ko chunauti di thi, ‘‘jaraa masjid kii seedhi par chadhakar dikhaao
 The Imam's job is to offer namaz in the mosque and convince people of the simplicity of Islam by their conduct
 islamic shashan vaale mulkon main imam ko kam se kam siyasat main dakhal kii chhot nahin he
 But in the democracy of Indian democracy, there is a relaxation of politics under the guise of Imamat

 However, some people in the central government claim that the ministry should think seriously about building a convention center instead of building a government house on this prime land
 hotel kii jagah hotel kyon nahin?desh kii rajdhani dilli main hotel kii samasya tab saamne ai thi jab 2010 main dilli main kaamanwealth games kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 At this time it was clear that when the capital of the country is not able to organize events like the Commonwealth Games, then how will it be claimed to organize the Olympic Games in future? bihar sarkaar ab schuli bacchon kii suraksha ke liye sajag hui he
 The government is now not only training teachers for the safety and protection of school children, but departmental officers have been instructed to draft a manual for this
 bihar shiksha pariyojna parishad (biipisi) ke rajya pariyojna nideshak sanjay singh ne buudhvaar ko bataaya ki nijee skulon sahit sabhi skulon ke bacchon kii suraksha or sangrakshan ke liye adhikariyon ko niyamavali kaa draft taiyaar karne ko kaha gaya he

 singh ne bataaya ki is niyamavali main daayitv nirvahan ke alaava sajaa kaa praavdhaan kiya jayega
 It is also instructed to clearly mention everything in the draft
 unhone bataaya ki biipisi ne unicef ke sahyog se bacchon kii suraksha ke gur seekhney ke liye shikshakon ko bhi prashikshit kar rahi he

 He informed that on the basis of this module, there are plans to train two teachers each of Kari b 5800 Secondary and Higher Secondary Schools in the state from January to March next year

 Recently, about 70,000 papers have been put on its website by wikileelk

 kijar ne kaha ki america court main osama kii maut kaa record he, jisamen uski maut kii adhikarik pushti hoti he
 So we have withdrawn all the criminal cases on him

 5 startamil or telegu industry main diarector chakri toleti ne kuch filmein banaai hai
 Then in 2017, Chakri also directed a Hindi film named Khamoshi with Tamannaah Bhatia
 chakri ek diarector ke saath hi actor ke rup main bhi kaam kar chuke hai
 Now he has made the Hindi film Welcome to New York with a very big star cast
 film dekhne jane kaa plan he to jaan len isaki kahani
 Diljit, who became a singer due to lack of money, only starts the 10th Pasakahani film's story at the IIFA Awards in New York for which a contest is held and 2 people are selected by the contest and get a chance to attend the IIFA Awards
 pehla shaks teji sandhu (dilajit dosanjh) hota he jise acting kaa bahut shauk he or hameshaa acting karata hua najar aata he, vahiin duusari chuni gayi ladki hoti hai jeenal patel (sonakshi sinha) jo ek darji ke rup main kaam karti hai
 Teji and Genel arrive in New York to watch the IIFA Awards, where there is already a mutual conflict between the event organizers (baman Irani and Lara Dutta Bhupathi), while Karan (karan Johar) and Arjun (karan Johar) are on the second track
 The enmity between us changes the story

 You can see why the film Ritesh Deshmukh and Diljit make you laugh the most
 karan johar dabl role main hai, rana daggubatti ke bhalaal vaale jokes, sushant singh rajput ko dhoni maanane par hone vaala kanfusion, dilajit dosanjh kaa had se zyada filmi hona film ko mjedaar banataa he

 The trailer of Welcome to New York's release is a weak episode of the weak episode, its story in which you cannot concentrate
 logic se hatakar ye film he
 At the same time, the songs of the film have not given any surprise before the release
 yahi kaaran he ki zyaadaatar audiyans ise tivi par dekhne kaa intjaar karegi
 In a way, filming during the award show itself has tried to create a cult two-handed work but it seems to be a complete failure

 Let us tell you that a few days ago RJD has also talked about welcoming Nitish Kumar from the open platform
 gauratlab he ki bijepi or jediu ke bich is bich jamkar bayaanbaji bhi hui he
 JDU leader Nitish Kumar, who won the election in 2015 along with the RJD, separated himself from the Grand Alliance in a year and a half and formed a government with the BJP

 haalanki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha he ki bihar main nitish kumaar kii aguwai main hi chunaav ladaa jayega
 But the relationship seems to be not so smooth

 After Amit Shah's statement, those people who were making noise of change in leadership, will now be silent
 gathbandhan ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti paidaa karne main nitish kumaar ne bhi bahut chaturaai dikhaai 
 His message came to us that he is not comfortable in that alliance

 ) nepal main senadhyaksh kii barkhaastagi kaa masalaa gaharaata ja rahaa he
 Six ministers have resigned in protest against the removal of the army chief
 ek taraf sena alert par he to maovadi gorillaon ne bhi kisi paristhiti ke liye kaman kas lee he
 For example, a bloody game can start in Nepal at any time
 maovadi netaa or nepal ke pradhanmantri prachand auranepal ke raashtrapati ram baran yadav ke bich than gai he
 The reason for this enmity is the Chief of Army Staff
 pradhanmantri prachand ne katwal ko hataane kii sifarish raashtrapati ram baran yadav se kii thi
 But the president rejected his recommendation
 isaki kai vajah raheen
 Actually, the Chief of Army Staff has strong control over the army
 saath hi intelegence par bhi unki badhiya pakad he
 Then there was no solid reason to remove Katwal
 saath hi raashtrapati bhi nahin chaahate ki sena kii kaman maovadiyon ke haath main jaae
 After the decision not to remove the Chief of Army Staff, Prime Minister Pranchad and President Ram Baran Yadav got into trouble
 nepal sarkaar ne katwal ko pad se barkhaast karne kii ghoshnaa kar di
 But Army Chief Rukmangad Katwal raised the flag of revolt against the government's decision
 pradhanmantri ke rup main kal (30 may) se narendra modi kii duusari pari shuru hone ja rahi he
 Before this, the discussion on every side is about who will get a place in Modi's new team
 mantrimandal ko lekar bijepi ke sheersh netritv main bhi maathapai chal rahi he
 On Tuesday, more than four and a half hours in the Prime Minister's House, there was intense discussion between Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 mana ja rahaa he ki aaj cabinet par tasviir puri tarah saaf ho jaaegi or yah pataa lag jayega ki modi cabinet main kitne nae chehron ko shaamil kiya janaa he or kitne puraane chehron ko phir se mauka diya jayega
 However, so far no leader has agreed to discuss the subject
 darasal, loksabhaa chunaav main prachand bahumat milane ke baad jab narendra modi ne sansad ke central haul main endie ke sabhi 353 saansadon ko sambodhit kiya to modi ne mantrimandal kaa bhi zikr kiya
 During this, Modi exhorted the mps that a lot of people are engaged in making ministers, but no one needs to be misled
 yahaan tak ki piem modi ne yah bhi kaha tha ki agar kisi saansad ko ko mantri banane ke sambandh main headquarter se phone aata he to use bhi vairiphoi kar len, kyonki kai baar juthi kol bhi kar di jaati he
 Today is the day when prospective ministers will be called
 kyonki kal (shaam 7 baje) shapath grahan samaaroh hona he, aise main yah mana ja saktaa he ki aaj shaam tak un saansadon ko suchit kar diya jayega jinhen mantrimandal main jagah di ja rahi he
 40 percent of new faces may be found that many veterans and current ministers will not find a place in the new NDA government headed by Narendra Modi and 40 percent of new faces will be included
 sisies (cabinet cameti on security) main shaamil maujuuda mantriyon main se 2 kii chuttee ho sakati he, unki jagah nae or apekshaakrit yuva chehron ko jagah mil sakati he
 According to BJP sources, this time the country may get a new finance, defense and foreign minister
 is baat kii sambhaavna he ki swasthya kaarnon se arun jetali is baar mantri bananaa pasand nahin karenge
 However, who gets a holiday and who gets an entry, this picture will be clear very soon
 kyonki mangalvaar shaam 5 baje se der raat narendra modi or amit shah kii mulaakaat main mantrimandal par marathon maathapai hui he
 Now it has to be seen which player's fate supports Modi's new team

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday that his government was 'seriously considering' the proposal to implement the odd-even scheme (even-odd system) in the national capital 15 days every month
 kejariwal ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki har maheene ek pakhwaade ke dauraan ise lagu kiye jane par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he, kyonki majboot saarvajanik parivahan pranali ke bina ise sthaayee nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The odd-even system, which will be implemented once again in the national capital from April 15, is the only major change compared to the first phase that the car carrying children in the school uniform will be exempt from it
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki viipi, sienji kaaron, mahilaon dwaara chalaai ja rahi kaaron, apaat chikitsa sthiti evam viklang logon ko le ja rahi kaaron ko is niyam se chhot milegi
 Kejriwal acknowledged that it is a little difficult to keep the cars carrying children in school uniforms exempt, as not all such vehicles can stand to bring children back from school
 tippaniyan The Chief Minister said, 'two things can happen in this case
 pehle maamle main ek vaahan bachche ko skool main chodta he, vahiin khadaa rahata he or bachche ko waapas lekar lautataa he

 (from input language) bahucharchit aarushi-hemraj murder cese main hoicourt se bari dow
 Rajesh and Nupur Talwar have been released from jail and reached their home
 lekin ek sawaal baar-baar logon ke jehan main kaundh rahaa he ki aakhir aarushi or hemraj kaa katl kisne kiya he
 The family of Hemraj, a resident of Nepal, is still looking for justice
 vah jaananaa chaah rahaa he ki is vaardaat ko kisne anjaam diya he
 Hemraj was considered the main suspect at the beginning of the investigation of the case
 nepal ke ek gaanv main rahane vaale hemraj banjaade ke parivaar main ek budhi biimaar maa, vidhwaa patni or 18 saal kaa betaa he
 One daughter is married
 yadi hemraj aaj jinda hota, to vah apane potee ko dekh paata
 He was the only one in the family
 talwaar danpati ke ghar rahakar jo kuch paata usee se puure parivaar kaa guzaara hota tha
 After his absence, the family is living very hard
 maa kii haalat to bahut hi kharaab he
 According to a report published in The Indian Express, Thakur Khanal, a member of the original Pravah All India Nepal Ekta Samaj, said that on May 16, 2008, the entire area was shocked after the aarushi-hemraj murder case was reported
 parivaar kaa bura haal tha
 The people of the village and the surrounding people together collected Rs one lakh and gave it to Hemraj's family
 lekin aaj 9 saal biit gaye hai
 There was no improvement in the condition of the family nor did they get justice
 rajkumaar or krishna bhi charchaa main aethakur khanal ne kaha ki talwaar danpati ke is cese se bari ho jane ke baad kuch media house nepal ke hi rahane vaale rajkumaar or krishna thapa ko andeh ke ghere main lene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 If both of them were guilty, the investigation team would have filed a charge sheet against them
 poligraphy test main bhi unke khilaaf kuch nahin niklaa he
 In such a situation, the media should not drag the name of Rajkumar and Krishna in this case
 un donon ko sukun se jeene dena chahie
 It was on Hemraj that Arushi's murder should be suspected that Aarushi's body was first seen in this incident
 iske baad logon ko laga tha ki hemraj ne aarushi kii hatya kii or faraar ho gaya
 But two days later, when the body of Hemraj was found on the roof of the same house, the mystery of the murder went deeper
 upi police kii jaanch team ne baad main aarushi ke mata-pita dow
 Blamed Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar
 kuch din baad is cese kii jaanch sibiai ko saunp di gai
 The High Court had denied the CBI theory in its closure report that it was the Talwar couple who carried out the incident
 sibiai kii theory thi ki aarushi or hemraj shaareerik sambandh bana rahe the
 At the same time, Rajesh saw the sword and killed it
 sibiai kii is daleel ko loar court ne maan kar umrakaid kii sajaa de di
 But in the High Court the whole matter turned upside down
 court kaa kahana tha ki forencik science main vyaktigat nateezon kii jagah nahin hoti he
 The doctor who performed the post-mortem revealed Dr
 naresh raaj ne bataaya ki unke dwaara di gai report ekasibiafasar kii theory se prabhavit thi
 During testimony at the Allahabad High Court, he had stated that the CBI officer's theory was linked to his marital experience and found that the process of physical relationship between Hemraj and Aarushi was going on
 sibiai team ke afasar agiel kaul ne unase kaha tha ki hemraj or aarushi shaareerik sambandh banane ja rahe the

 ek email aayaa he ki agar main skulon par jansunwaayee ek maheenaa tak karata rahun tab bhi koi fark nahin padegaa, kyonki skool netaaon or adhikariyon ke hote hai
 Even the orders of the courts are not accepted
 main sweekaar karata hum ki unki yah baat sahi he, lekin aaj na kal netaaon ko skulon kii manamaani ke sawaal par aana hoga
 Even though the leaders of his party run schools and supply black money from there, the way the parent association is being activated across the country, it will not last long
 hamaare paas jo email aa rahe hai usamen privet skulon ko lekar nae-nae shabd judate ja rahe hai
 We have read many emails
 unhen agar koi netaa pard rahe hai or skulon kii manamaani kii raajnneeti shuru kar de to kaaphi lokapriy ho saktaa he
 Reading these emails, it is coming to know that parents are not silent
 ve ziladhikari se lekar mukhyamantri, nyaayadhishon se lekar pradhanmantri tak ko patr likh rahe hai
 No action is being taken, that is another matter
 aadesh paarit hote hai magar lagu nahin hote lekin aisa nahin he ki maa-baap skulon kii is ghulaami se mukt nahin hona chaahate hai
 After reading the email, it felt that there is really financial pressure on the parents
 privet job main unki selary ab kam raftaar se bad rahi he magar schoolo main fees badhane kii raftaar kaaphi tej he
 Therefore, many parents do not pay the fees of two children on time, so late fees have to be paid
 hamen bahut se email let fees ko lekar mili hai
 Letters have come from Nawanshahar in Punjab, Bundi in Rajasthan, Kishanganj, Dumariaganj, Gaya, Sasaram, Muzaffarpur in Bihar
 bengal ke kolkata, asanasol se bhi kai logon ne email kiya he
 Letters are also coming from Visakhapatnam

 in patron ko pard kar laga rahaa he ki dilli se lekar jhunjhanu or barhampur se lekar bastar tak ke skulon kii fees main koi antar nahin rah gaya he, jabaki in jagahon par kamai main antar aa jaataa he
 Obviously the pressure on the parents will increase
 sarkarein inaki samasya ko nazarandaaz nahin kar sakati hai
 Gautam from Kishanganj in Bihar has written that after getting fed up with fees, he removed the child from private school
 kai jagahon par maa baap ko skool badalanaa padaa he lekin usamen bhi dikkat ai he
 Transfer certificates have been given for the entire three months, and then transfer certificates have been given
 ye sab logon ke email main he
 a letter has come out that in 2013, he had deposited Rs 44000 in the form of cochin money
 lekin fees badhane ke kaaran jab skool badalane kaa faisla kiya tab sirf 6000 hi lautaae gaye
 The school deducted Rs 38,000 in the name of admission fee
 admician ke samay kaha gaya tha ki coshan mani puraa waapas hoga
 It is true that parents complain about this, but there is no hearing

 saraswati puja ke naam par ek skool 500 rupee prati chaatr le rahaa he
 There is a lot of complaint about cash fees
 ise dekhte hue pradhanmantri ko zarur nazar daalani chahie
 By one of his orders, it may be possible that there is no cash transaction in schools, but instead the children whose children are studying in schools take the examination of Prime Minister's Cashlesh Abhiyan every day
 isliye sarkaar ko bhi ise lekar atirikt rup se sakriy or samvedansheel hona chahie
 Many times, a decision taken with good intentions also turns upside down
 maharashtra ke aurangabad se aayaa email bataata he ki shahar main public transport kii vyavastha nahin he
 The commissioner decided that no more than 4 children would go to the auto and 10 to the van
 chunki bas nahin he to ab vine ke 500 kii jagah 1200 dene pad gaye kyonki vine vaala zyaada vasuulne laga
 It is such a cycle that even if the decision comes, it is implicated
 ab aap ek sawaal khud se puuchhiye
 Why the school will decide which brand of shoe you will wear
 upi se ek email aayaa he
 It says that the footwear company has opened many schools

 kolkata se ek email aayaa he ki nursery ke bachche ko mahange brands kaa juuta kharidne ke liye majaboor kiya gaya he jisaki keemat 2000 rupee he
 Recently, the Education Minister of Gujarat has said that schools are taking such a donation that you cannot think
 skool faisla kar rahe hai ki kis brand kaa juuta kis dukaan se khareednaa he
 The cell outlets of these brands are opened in schools and parents are forced to buy uniforms, bags, shoes from there

 This thing has started reaching the governments
 rajasthan sarkaar ne bhi ek acha faisla kiya he
 Intention is good kam se kam yahaan tak to baat pahunchi he

 We have read many emails
 unhen agar koi netaa pard rahe hai or skulon kii manamaani kii raajnneeti shuru kar de to kaaphi lokapriy ho saktaa he
 Reading these emails, it is coming to know that parents are not silent
 ve ziladhikari se lekar mukhyamantri, nyaayadhishon se lekar pradhanmantri tak ko patr likh rahe hai
 No action is being taken, that is another matter
 aadesh paarit hote hai magar lagu nahin hote lekin aisa nahin he ki maa-baap skulon kii is ghulaami se mukt nahin hona chaahate hai
 After reading the email, it felt that there is really financial pressure on the parents
 privet job main unki selary ab kam raftaar se bad rahi he magar schoolo main fees badhane kii raftaar kaaphi tej he
 Therefore, many parents do not pay the fees of two children on time, so late fees have to be paid
 hamen bahut se email let fees ko lekar mili hai
 Letters have come from Nawanshahar in Punjab, Bundi in Rajasthan, Kishanganj, Dumariaganj, Gaya, Sasaram, Muzaffarpur in Bihar
 bengal ke kolkata, asanasol se bhi kai logon ne email kiya he
 Letters are also coming from Visakhapatnam
 odisha ke barhampur, bargarh se email aae hai
 a letter has also come from Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan
 dilli ke takreeban har ilaake se email aayaa he
 The letter has come from Renukoot, Nawabganj, Pilibhit, UP
 in patron ko pard kar laga rahaa he ki dilli se lekar jhunjhanu or barhampur se lekar bastar tak ke skulon kii fees main koi antar nahin rah gaya he, jabaki in jagahon par kamai main antar aa jaataa he
 Obviously the pressure on the parents will increase
 sarkarein inaki samasya ko nazarandaaz nahin kar sakati hai
 Gautam from Kishanganj in Bihar has written that after getting fed up with fees, he removed the child from private school
 kai jagahon par maa baap ko skool badalanaa padaa he lekin usamen bhi dikkat ai he
 Transfer certificates have been given for the entire three months, and then transfer certificates have been given
 ye sab logon ke email main he
 a letter has come out that in 2013, he had deposited Rs 44000 in the form of cochin money
 lekin fees badhane ke kaaran jab skool badalane kaa faisla kiya tab sirf 6000 hi lautaae gaye
 The school deducted Rs 38,000 in the name of admission fee
 admician ke samay kaha gaya tha ki coshan mani puraa waapas hoga
 It is true that parents complain about this, but there is no hearing
 skulon ke baahar pradarshan bhi kar aate hai magar koi nahin sunata lekin luute ke yo kisse hai use achche privet skool ke naam par sahi nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 If nothing can happen, they should be heard
 9veen or dasvin ke chaatr hamen email kar rahe hai, isliye main nahin maanata ki kuch nahin hoga
 If nothing happens, it will be the defeat of society, not mine
 hamane lut ke chand kisse aaj bhi chhante hai email se
 a school in Banaras has taken Rs 800 for the diary
 sasaram ke ek skool ne online kitaab kareedne par bhi skool kii raseed main kitaab kii keemat jod di
 a school in Bhavnagar takes 25000 cash but gives a receipt of two and a half thousand
 damoh, madhya pradesh kaa ek skool science kii kitaab 595 rupee main de rahaa he
 a school in Kolkata has charged Rs 2000 for a bag
 ek skool 80 rupee kaa color 300 rupee main liya ja rahaa he
 a school in Jaipur essentially takes 1000 rupees from all students in the name of a journal
 is jarnal main prerak kahaniyon ke naam par bakawaas bhare hote hai
 When two children from a family study, they have to pay 2000 for the same journal
 saraswati puja ke naam par ek skool 500 rupee prati chaatr le rahaa he
 There is a lot of complaint about cash fees
 ise dekhte hue pradhanmantri ko zarur nazar daalani chahie
 By one of his orders, it may be possible that there is no cash transaction in schools, but instead the children whose children are studying in schools take the examination of Prime Minister's Cashlesh Abhiyan every day
 isliye sarkaar ko bhi ise lekar atirikt rup se sakriy or samvedansheel hona chahie
 Many times, a decision taken with good intentions also turns upside down
 maharashtra ke aurangabad se aayaa email bataata he ki shahar main public transport kii vyavastha nahin he
 The commissioner decided that no more than 4 children would go to the auto and 10 to the van
 chunki bas nahin he to ab vine ke 500 kii jagah 1200 dene pad gaye kyonki vine vaala zyaada vasuulne laga
 It is such a cycle that even if the decision comes, it is implicated
 ab aap ek sawaal khud se puuchhiye
 Why the school will decide which brand of shoe you will wear
 upi se ek email aayaa he
 It says that the footwear company has opened many schools
 saare skool main uske juute anivaary rup se bikate hai or zyaada daam par
 Why should one wear expensive and foreign brand shoes in the name of discipline? kya saadagi se anushaasan nahin aata he, kya mahange brands se hi anushaasan aata he, kaala juuta hi pahananaa he to chaatr apni kshamta se kyon na kharide? skool koun hota he tay karne vaala ki aap mahange brands kaa juuta 2000 main khreeden

 skool faisla kar rahe hai ki kis brand kaa juuta kis dukaan se khareednaa he
 The cell outlets of these brands are opened in schools and parents are forced to buy uniforms, bags, shoes from there
 ye sahi chalan nahin he
 This thing has started reaching the governments
 rajasthan sarkaar ne bhi ek acha faisla kiya he
 Intention is good kam se kam yahaan tak to baat pahunchi he
 According to the new decision, private schools will not be able to sell books within the school
 niyam paalan nahin hoga to manyata radd hoga
 Parents will also be able to buy uniforms and other materials from the market
 kisi bhi saamagree par skool apana naam ankit nahin kar sakegaa
 The school will not decide from which shop to buy goods

 It is such a cycle that even if the decision comes, it is implicated
 ab aap ek sawaal khud se puuchhiye
 Why the school will decide which brand of shoe you will wear
 upi se ek email aayaa he
 It says that the footwear company has opened many schools
 saare skool main uske juute anivaary rup se bikate hai or zyaada daam par
 Why should one wear expensive and foreign brand shoes in the name of discipline? kya saadagi se anushaasan nahin aata he, kya mahange brands se hi anushaasan aata he, kaala juuta hi pahananaa he to chaatr apni kshamta se kyon na kharide? skool koun hota he tay karne vaala ki aap mahange brands kaa juuta 2000 main khreeden
 Do all parents studying in school have the same ability? raipur kaa ek skool mahange brands kaa juuta kareedne par majaboor karata he
 There is no exemption for school children
 email main kaha gaya he ki baaki shaharon se unase adhik daam vasule gaye hai
 The comments jise samaj main aata he wo bhi or jise samaj nahin aata he wo bhi, ek baat saral hindi main samaj le
 This is called slavery
 aap ghulaam ho chuke hai
 Schools have tried various tricks for the sale of shoes, which we are accepting without putting in mind
 hamen poochna chahie ki skool main videshi brands kaa juuta pahanakar wo koun sa anushaasit naagarik ban rahaa he
 In the name of discipline, he is becoming a slave citizen
 yah baat syrius he tab bhi syrius he jab hamaare ek maheene tak jansunwaayee karne ke baad bhi koi fark nahin padegaa
 This will not change the reality of your slavery

 Does not discipline come from simplicity, does discipline come from expensive brands, black shoes have to be worn, so why should students not buy from their capacity? Who is going to school decides that you buy an expensive brand shoe in 2000
 kya skool main padhane vaale sabhi maa baap kii kshamta ek hi hoti he
 a school in Raipur forces them to buy expensive brand shoes
 skool ke bacchon ke liye koi chhot nahin hoti he
 The email states that they have been charged more than the rest of the cities
 tippaniyan Even the one who understands and the one who does not understand, understand one thing in simple Hindi
 ise ghulaami kehete hai
 You have been enslaved
 schoolo ne juuton kii bikri ke liye tarah tarah ke tikadam kiye hai jinhen ham bina dimag lagaae sweekaar kar rahe hai
 We should ask who is he becoming a disciplined citizen by wearing foreign brand shoes in school
 anushaasan ke naam par wo gulam naagarik ban rahaa he
 This thing is serious even if it is serious even after we listen to it for a month
 isse aapaki gulaami kii hakeekat nahin badal jaaegi
 An email has come from Kolkata that the nursery child has been forced to buy an expensive brand shoe which costs Rs 2000
 haal hi main gujarat ke shiksha mantri ne kaha he ki skool itani donneton le rahe hai ki aap soch nahin sakate
 Schools are deciding which brand to buy from which shop
 in brand ke cell outlet skulon main khole jate hai or abhibhavakon ko majaboor kiya jaataa he ki wo unifarm, bag, juute sab vahiin se khariden
 This is not the right practice
 sarkaron tak yah baat pahunchane lagi he
 The Rajasthan government has also taken a good decision
 niyat acchhee he
 At least it has reached here
 nae faisle ke anusaar privet skool skool ke bheetar kitaab nahin bech paaenge
 If the rules are not followed then the recognition will be canceled
 unifarm or anya saamagree bhi abhibhavak bazaar se kareed sakenge
 The school will not be able to mark its name on any material
 skool nahin tay karegaa ki kis dukaan se saamaan kharidni he
 The school will release the list of books on the website a month before the session starts
 is suchi main kitabon ke lekhak, prakaashak or mulyon kii jaankaree hogi
 No school will be able to change uniforms for five years

 He is also the Mamaji (uncle) of Nisha, Asher and Noah
 He is the sole bread winner which makes it very difficult for his family to bear the expenses of his treatment
 He has a wife, a mother and his child who depend on him
 He has been fighting Kidney failure
 One year ago he was hospitalized in a horrible hospital that was not treating his condition properly and told him that he needed to remove his kidneys
 They would have killed him for his organs
 Daniel (my husband ) and i had no idea until the last minute and removed him from that place immediately and cleared his bills for release
 We then admitted him in a proper hospital and he saw a kidney specialist who informed us that only 20% of his kidneys are functioning
 With proper eating and medication he has been able to make it through the year
 His entire family depends on him for his survival, making it nearly impossible for him to take the rest that he so badly requires for his medical condition
 He has recently been hospitalized because he has complete kidney failure and has to be on dialysis
 He was even recently pronounced dead on the table and somehow with the hand of God he was resuscitated and brought back to us
 He now needs a kidney transplant so he can recover properly to live and work in the field that makes him so happy

 bataa den ki pakistan ke karachi or sindh praant main alpsankhyak hinduon kii taadaad kaaphi zyada he
 The Pakistan Hindu Council has accused the community members of targeting the community under the blasphemy law due to personal enmity with Dr Ramesh
 centre for soshal justise ke aankadon ke mutabik pakistan main 1987 se 2016 ke bich ishaninda kanoon ke tahat kam se kam 1,472 logon par aarope lagaae gaye hai
 Hindus are the largest minority community in Pakistan
 aadhikarik anumaanon ke anusaar, pakistan main kareeb 75 lakh hindu rahete hai
 However some communities cite the number of Hindus in the country to 90 lakhs
 pakistan kii adhikansh hindu aabaadi sindh praant main basii hui he jahaan ve muslimon ke saath samskruti, parampara or bhashaa saajha kar ek saath rahete hai
 What is the blasphemy law? The blasphemy law was introduced in Pakistan during the rule of General Zia ul Haq
 is kanoon ke tahat dharmik sabha main baadha paidaa karnaa, kabrgah yaa shmashaan kaa atikaraman, dharmik aasthaaon kaa apmaan or puja ke sthal yaa saamagree ko jaan boojhkar nuksaan pahunchaana aata he
 In this law, Pakistan's military ruler zia-ul-haq added many new provisions in the year 1982 and made it extremely strict by adding section 295B
 1986 main ishaninda kanoon main dhara 295 si jodi gai jisamen paigambar mohammad ke apmaan ko aparaadh kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya or aisa karne waalon ke liye aaajeevan karawas yaa phir sajaa-e-maut kaa niyam banaaya gaya
 However, most of the cases in Pakistan under blasphemy are registered only on minorities

 kuch log kaary kaa shubharambh karte samay sarvapratham shriganeshy nam: likhte hai
 Even while writing the letter, we mention the name of 'ung' or Sriganesh
 shriganesh ko pratham pujan kaa adhikari kyon maanate hai?logon kaa vishwaas he ki ganesh ke naam samaran maatr se unke kaary nirvighn sampann hote hai- isliye vinayak ke pujan main 'vinayako vighnraja-dwaimatur ganadhip' strot paath karne kii paripati chal padi he
 There is even Ganesh Uppurana by his name
 puraana-purush ganesh kii mahima kaa gungan sarvatra kyon kiya jaataa he? yah prashn uthanaa swaabhaavik he
 a story prevails in this regard
 ek baar sabhi devon main yah prashn uthaa ki prithvi par sarvapratham kis dev kii puja honi chahie
 All the gods started calling themselves great
 ant main is samasya ko sulajhane ke liye devarshi naarad ne shiv ko ninaryak banane kii salaah di
 Shiva organized a contest thoughtfully - those who ride their vehicle and revolve around the earth and return first, they will be the first worshipers on earth
 sabhi dev apane vaahanon par savaar ho chal pade
 Ganesha revolved around his father Shiva and mother Parvati seven times and stood with folded hands before him
 kartikeya apane mayur vaahan par arudh ho prithvi kaa chakkar lagaakar laute or darp se bole, 'main is spardhaa main vijayi hua, isliye prithvi par pratham puja paane kaa adhikari main hum
 'shiva looked at Vinayak standing in devotion near his feet and said in a happy posture,' Son Ganesh has revolved around the universe before you, he will be the first worshiper
 'kartikeyakhinn hokar bole, 'pitaaji, yah kaise sambhav he? ganesh apane mooshak vaahan par baithkar kai varsho main brahmad kii parikrama kar sakate hai
 Are you mocking somewhere? ' 'no son! Ganesh, revolving around his parents, has proved that the parents are more than the universe
 ganesh ne jagat ko is baat kaa gyaan karaayaa he
 In this way, all the other gods came and everyone accepted in one voice that Ganesha is the only one who is the first worshiper on earth
 ganesh jike sambandh main bhi anek kathaayen puraanon main varnit hai
 According to a legend, Shiva once went on a voyage with ghosts in the Himalayas to observe the beauty of the universe
 parvati ji snaan karne ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 Thought that no one should come in, so they made a statue with the embossing of their body and placed it on the guard in front of the door
 use aadesh diya ki kisi ko bhi andar aane se roak de
 The boy started guarding the gate
 ganesh pujan se paaen lakshmi krupa
 
 
 Shiva arrived in this way
 vah andar jane lage
 The boy prevented them from going inside
 shiv ji ne krodh main aakar us balka kaa sir kaat daalaa
 Returning from the bath, Parvati saw this scene
 shiv jiko sara vrittant sunaakar kaha, 'aapane yah kya kar daalaa? yah to hamaara putr he
 Shiva ji was sad
 bhootganon ko bulaakar aadesh diya ki koi bhi praani uttar disha main sir rakhkar sota ho, to uskaa sir katkar le aao
 The ghosts cut off his head
 shiv ji ne us balak ke dhad par hathi kaa sir chipkaakar usamen praan phoonk die
 Thus the boy became popular as 'gajavadan'
 duusari katha
 
 
 The second story is also popular about the birth of Ganesha
 ek baar parvati ke man main yah ichha paidaa hui ki unke ek aisa putr ho jo samast devataaon main pratham pujan paae
 He told his wish to Shiva
 is par shiv ji ne unhen puspak vrath manaane kii salaah di
 Parvati resolved to perform the Pushpak fast and invited all the gods and goddesses to participate in that yagna
 nishchit tithi par yajna kaa shubharambh hua
 The Yagyamandal was illuminated by the light of all the deities
 shiv ji aagat devataaon ke aadar-satkar main sanlagn the, lekin vishnu bhagwaan kii anupasthiti ke kaaran unka man vikal tha
 Know which is the most powerful form of Ganesha
 
 
 thodi der baad vishnu bhagwaan apane vaahan garud par arudh ho aa pahunche
 Everyone cheered him up and welcomed him
 uchit asana par unako bithaaya gaya
 Brahmaji's son Sanatkumar was performing the yajna ritual
 veda mantron ke saath yajna prarambh hua
 As soon as the yagya ended smoothly
 vishnu bhagwaan ne parvati ko aashirwad diya, 'parvati! aapaki manokamana purna hogi
 According to your resolve, a son will arise
 ' bhagwaan vishnu kaa aashirwad paakar parvati prasann ho gai
 At the same time Sanatkumar said, 'I am the Ritvik of this yajna
 yajna safaltaapurvak sampann ho gaya he, parantu shaastra-vidhi ke anusaar jab tak purohit ko uchit dakshina dekar santusht nahin kiya jaataa, tab tak yagyakarta ko yajna kaa fal praapt nahin hoga
 "say, Purohit ji, what Dakshina do you want?" Parvati ji asked
 'bhagwati, main aapke patidevshiv jiko dakshina swaroop chahta hum
 shiva-parvati kept the radha-krishna form
 
 
 parvati tadapakar boli, 'purohit ji, aap pera saubhaahgya maang rahe hai
 You are aware that any woman can donate everything, but can never give her good luck
 aap kripaya koi or vastu mangiye
 'but Sanatkumar remained adamant on his persistence
 unhone saaf kah diya ki ve shiv ji ko hi dakshina main lenge, dakshina na dene par yajna kaa fal parvati ji ko praapt na hoga
 The gods explained Sanatkumar in many ways, but they kept their word
 is par bhagwaan vishnu ne parvati ji ko samajhaayaa, 'parvati ji!yadi aap purohit ko dakshina na dengi to yajna kaa fal aapako nahin milegaa or aapaki manokamana bhi puri na hogi
 Parvati answered in a firm voice, 'lord! i do not want to get a son, deprived of my husband
 mujhe keval mere pati hi abhisht hai
 Shiva ji nodded and said, 'parvati, you give me Dakshina
 tumhaara ahit na hoga
 Parvati agreed to give her husband in Dakshina, when a divine light emerged from the space and came to earth
 uske bheetar se shrikrishna apane divya rup ko lekar prakat hue
 Visiting that world form Sanatkumar was enamored and said, 'bhagwati! Now i do not want Dakshina
 meraa vaanchit fal mujhe mil gaya
 'the whole yagmandapa echoed from Shri Krishna's life
 iske baad sabhi devtaa vahaan se chale gaye
 Shortly afterwards a vip prostitute came and said to Parvati ji, 'mother, i am hungry, give food
 ' parvati ji ne mishtann laakar aagatuk ke samaane rakh diya
 Finishing the platter within a few minutes, Dwij asked again, 'mother, i am not hungry, let me eat a little more
 ' vah brahman baraabar maangata rahaa, parvati ji kuch-na-kuch laakar khilaati raheen, phir bhi vah santusht na hua
 Kept asking for something else parvati ji kii sahansheeltaa jaati rahi
 This is a special mantra to please Lord Shiva
 
 
 vah khiz uthin, shiv ji ke paas jaakar shikayati swar main boleen, 'dev, na maaloom yah kaisaa yaachak he
 Oh how fed, and asks
 kahata he ki uskaa pet nahin bharaa
 Where else can i bring and feed
 ' shiv ji ko us yaachak par aashcharya hua
 Arrived to see that, but there were no petitioners
 parvati chakit hokar boli, 'abhi to yaheen tha, na maaloom kaise adrishy ho gaya' shiv ji ne mandahas karte hue kaha, 'devi, vah kahin nahin gaya
 It is here, in your belly
 vah koi paraayaa nahin, saakshaat tumhaara hi putr ganesh he
 Your wish has been fulfilled
 tumhen puspak yajna kaa fal praapt ho gaya he
 Thus, by the grace of Lord Shiva, Ganesha took birth and became the Ganadhipati
 samast vishwa ke sankat dur karte hue vighneshwar kehalaae

 During the last hearing, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had said that this is a very serious matter
 vistrut sunwaayee kii jarurat he
 In fact, since the formation of the BJP government under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath in March 2017, there have been constant questions about the police encounter in the state
 yachika main NGO ne upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke puraane bayanon ko bhi shaamil kiya he jinamein unhone aparaadhiyon ko goli maarane kii baat kahi he

 tripura vidhansabha chunaav main matdaan kam kya hua, raajnneetik panditon se rajaneta tak tarah-tarah ke myne nikaal rahe hai
 The CPM is claiming that the party will come to power again
 vahiin bijepi taal thok rahi he ki party pehali baar tripura kii satta kaa swaad chakhegi
 It is clear that before the election results, all parties claim victory
 ravivaar ko hue tripura vidhansabha chunaav main 78
 The turnout was 56 percent, compared to 91 in the last assembly election
 82 fisadi matdaan se kareeb 13 fisadi kam hua he
 Peaceful voting was held on 59 of the total 60 seats in the state assembly
 is baar hue kam voting ke siyaasi myne talaashe jane lage hai
 It is believed that the results of this time may be somewhat unexpected
 parvatiy pradesh tripura kii phija badali hua najar ai
 This time, there is competition between the two parties in Tripura and the CPM has been in power for two and a half decades, while the BJP is increasingly making its presence in the Northeast
 bijepi vikaas ke mudde ko lekar utari thi
 Electoral war is not easy this time for the Left Front, which has been in power for 25 years
 bijepi ne purvottar main apane pair pasaarne ke makasad se tripura vidhansabha chunaav main puri takat jhonk di thi
 Not only this, due to the strict attitude of the Election Commission, it is believed that the voting has reduced this time
 tripura kii raajnneeti par paini nigaah rakhane vaale logon ko bhi lagata he ki kam voting is baar ke chunaav nattejey chaunkaa sakate hai
 It is not necessary that the ruling party in the state loses due to low polling and the opposition wins because of high polling
 matdaan kam hone par bhi jeet sakate hai or matdaan zyada hone par bhi fatah kar sakate hai
 The same criterion can also apply to defeat
 haalanki ek baat saaf he ki 13 fisadi matdaan kam hone kii vajah se siyaasi phija main bada ulatpher ho saktaa he
 Chief Minister Manik Sarkar, who has been in command of Tripura for the last two decades, has faced a tough challenge from BJP for the first time
 haalanki mukhyamantri maanik sarkaar svachh or eemaandaar chhavi ke liye jane jate hai, lekin bijepi or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke log pichley kuch samay se jis prakaar se jamini str par sakriya hokar chunaav prachaar kiya, wo sipiem ke liye nuksaan kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 There may be several reasons for the low turnout in Tripura
 philhal matdaan kam hone kii pehali vajah ye he ki voters main pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke tulana main utsaah kaa kam hona
 The second reason is also believed that voting has reduced due to the tough attitude of the Election Commission
 sipiem ke cader par bijepi aarope lagaati rahi he wo booth par gundai karke farji vot dalwane kaa kaam karte hai
 In such a situation, if the bjp's allegations are true, then the voting may be less trouble for the CPM
 duusari taraf bijepi loklubhaavan vaade ke saath chunaav maidan main utari thi
 BJP has made promises such as free smartphone for youth in Tripura, free graduation for women, education, employment, implementation of recommendations of Seventh Pay Commission for employees
 ye aisa pahalu hota hai jo nateezon ko kaaphi had tak prabhavit karte hai
 If the Manik Sarkar got nearly fifty percent of the vote in the last election and there is no such wave of public dissatisfaction towards him, then it will not be easy to get him out of power
 pradesh sarkaar ne bhi kai kaam kiye hai or unke bhi apane vaade hai
 Tripura has been a relatively peaceful state in the northeastern states, but people are dissatisfied with the law and order situation due to the incidents of rape and murder in the past, so that they can vote for change of the system
 par jis tarah se voting kam hui he
 It has been a matter of satisfaction for Manik Sarkar

 The Shiv Sena in its mouthpiece Saamna has described the Bihar election results as a message to Maharashtra
 kaha he ki iskaa saaf sandesh yah he ki maharashtra main agali baar chunaav honge to shivasena hi leader banakar ubharegi, kyonki shivasena hi bhavishya he
 Now who will take responsibility for this defeat? bijepi ko ab aatmanirikshan kii jarurat he

 purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne RSS ke kaarykram main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa sweekaar kar congress netaaon ke hi nahin balki unki beti ko bhi asamanjas main daal diya he
 The Congress party and his family are uneasy about Pranab's decision
 purv rashtriya 7 june ko nagpur main sangh ke ek kaarykram main bataur vaktaa shaamil honge
 On this some Congress leaders believe that Pranab should change his decision to join the program
 lekin zyaadaatar netaaon ke pranab ke us bhaashan kaa intjaar he jo vahasangh ke kaarykramame denge
 Congressmen hope that the former president will act as a mirror to the RSS or as former finance minister p Chidambaram wants Pranab to convey to the RSS through his address what are the flaws in his ideology
 pranab mukherjee kii beti sharmishtha mukherjee jo dilli congress kii mukhya pravaktaa bhi hai, is maamle par sawaal poochne par jhalla gayi
 He says that this question should be asked by the national spokespersons of the Congress Party
 unhone india today se baatcheet main kaha, 'pranab mukherjee kii ore se nyauta sweekaar karne kii kya vajah he isapar mujhe kyon bolnaa chahie, main sirf unki beti hum
 You should ask this question to the party's national spokespersons' Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari also seemed to be avoiding answering on this issue
 unhone kaha ki praban mukherjee ko RSS ne apane kaarykram menshamil hone kaa aamantrandia he is faisle par kaa jawaab to khud purv raashtrapati hi de sakate hai
 When Pranab Mukherjee's personal secretary Abhijeet Rai was approached on this matter, he said that the former president does not want to say a word on the issue
 congress ke ek varisht netaa to is maamle par tanj kasate dikhe
 He said that Pranab Mukherjee is a very energetic person because in spite of such scorching heat, Mukherjee decided to go to Nagpur in a temperature of 50 degrees
 unhone kaha ki raashtrapati kaa pad chhodane kaa baad ab vah aaazaad parinde hai, ho saktaa he ki july main jab garmi kam ho tab mukherjee jamaat e islamic ke kaarykram main shaamil hone ko taiyaar ho jaaen
 a senior Congress leader said that we have been listening to Mukherjee's speech at the Congress training programs since 1980
 vah khud ko hameshaa se ek sampradayik sauhaard vaale or dharmanirpeksh netaa ke rup main pesh karte aae hai
 Right now the Sangh and BJP are responsible for all the flaws in the country, so Mukherjee should not attend the program
 lekin dukh is baat kaa he ki unhone jane kaa faisla kiya he

 Although it was being speculated that Kanhaiya will be the candidate of the grand alliance for the last several months, the RJD leadership did not make Kanhaiya its candidate
