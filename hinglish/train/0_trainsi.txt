 Many Congress leaders themselves are not satisfied with the action under Rasuka (NSA) in two separate cases of cow slaughter and illegal trafficking of cows by the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh

 Congress veteran p Chidambaram has termed the arrest of three people as Rasuka wrong in the cow slaughter case and said that it has been taken up before the Madhya Pradesh government
 congress netaa chidambaram ne kaha ki 'madhya pradesh main rashtriya suraksha adhininam (NSA) kaa istemaal galat tha
 It has been raised before the Government of Madhya Pradesh

 unhone kaha he ki gauvadh (gohatya) par rasuka nahin lagani chahie
 Digvijay Singh told reporters about the action of Rasuka on three people in Khandwa recently, 'the accused should have been taken under the law made for cow slaughter, should not be put on Rasuka

 In view of the sluggish pace and economic slowdown and the very small increase in the income of farmers, the steps taken so far are only immediate relief and what needs to be done is that the focus of agricultural policies should really be on the livelihood of the farmers out of production and the farmers should get MSP and Also, government procurement of food grains and other commodities under MSP in most of the states despite the promise of 50 per cent is extremely low
 In view of fluctuations in prices and non-availability of loans on time, steps need to be taken to help the farmers
 Agriculture markets need basic facilities and farmers have to be ready to compete if they want to get a better price for their produce
 Agricultural policies should be such that real farmers benefit, not middlemen, as is seen in most states of land and water use

 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati targeted the Modi government and the BJP for completing one year of demonetisation
 saath hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke notebandi ke nirnay ko aparipakv qaraar dete hue bhaajapa ko salaah di ki vah aaj ke din ko 'anti blike mani de' manaane ke bajaae 'notebandi maafee diwas' manaae
 Along with this, Mayawati linked the demonetisation to the 'paradise Paper' case, saying that the BJP and the company specializes in cheating the public and drinking ghee in a blanket
 purv mukhyamantri mayawati ne maganlwar ko apane jari bayaan main kaha, 'pradhanmantri narendra modi sarkaar dwaara jaldbaaji or aparipakv tareeke se liya gaya 500 or 1000 rupee kii notebandi kaa faislaaarthik immergencilagu karne jaisaa rahaa, jisamen mutthibhar chahete netaaon or udyogpatiyon ko chhodkar desh ke sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ko abhootpurv tangi ke sankat main daal diya gaya
 The decision of demonetisation has proved to be a dark chapter in the history of India
 'basapa adhyaksh ne kaha, 'modi sarkaar ke is nirankush faisle ke kaaran desh aaj bhi apatkaal ke sankatkalin daur se guzar rahaa he
 While announcing the ban on demonetisation, Modi had said that it would end corruption
 lekin logon ko pratadit karne vaale is nirnay ke baad sarkari bhrashtachar har str par kaaphi badha he
 The former chief minister, while targeting a disclosure made by a website about the transactions made by the company close to the BJP leaders, said that one by one the busts of corruption, illegal and improper acts of big and close people of BJP & Company were exposed
 This is happening, which is causing the corruption of the central government
 yah karname sabit karte hai ki modi sarkaar bhrashtachar ke abhishaap se mukt nahin, balki bhrashtachar se yukt sarkaar he
 He said that many new sources of corruption have arisen out of demonetisation, which has also been taken advantage of by the close and dear ones of BJP & Company
 'paradise paper' kii baat karte hue basapa adhyaksh ne kaha, 'paradise paper bhandaphod' or media dwaara anya khulaase is baat ko pramanit karte hai ki bhaajapa and company ke log janata ko thag rahe hai or kambal odh kar ghi pine main maahir hai
 Even in this case of corruption, the silence and inaction of the BJP government is no longer a secret, because in every such case, the Modi government goes on silently
 ''anti blike mani de' manaa rahi bhaajapa ko mayawati ne salaah dete hue kaha, 'notebandi ko lekar unke sabhi sarkari daawey ek ke baad ek puure taur par galat va jhuthe sabit hote ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, our advice is that instead of celebrating 'anti Black Money Day', he should celebrate 'demonetization Forgiveness Day'

 This is the first time Jadhav has received consular access since the arrest of Kulbhushan Jadhav by Pakistan in 2016
 gaurav ahaluwalia or kulbhushan jadhav kii mulaakaat kareeb dhai ghante tak chali
 According to the Treaty of Vienna and following the international court, Pakistan today gave consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav
 pakistan kii taraf se pehle bhi iskaa ofer diya gaya tha, lekin isamen usne kuch sharten jod di thim jiskaa bharat ne virodh kiya tha
 Now on Sunday, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman once again informed about consular access

Pakistan had to face international court in this matter, after which Kulbhushan Jadhav was forced to give consular access
 haalanki, pehle pakistan kii ore se shart lagaai gai thi jab bhartiya rajanyik usase mulaakaat karenge tab pakistan kaa ek adhikari bhi unke saath hoga, haalanki bharat ko ye baat manjuur nahin thi

 However, this claim has been denied by India

 jiske baad ye masalaa antarrashtriya court pahunchaa or vahaan se faansee kii sajaa par roak laga di gai
 What is consular access? Actually, if a citizen of one country is locked up in another country, then he can get this facility
 udhaaharan ke taur par kulbhushan jadhav bhartiya naagarik hai
 He has been imprisoned by Pakistan
 ab donon sarkaron kii sahmati ke baad jo bhartiya rajdoot yaa adhikari kulbhushan jadhav se mulaakaat kar paaegaa, use consuler acces kaha jaataa he

 Earlier sources had said that Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung may invite the largest party BJP to form the government
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne up-rajyapal kii vah sifarish manjuur kar lee he, jisamen unhone sabase badi party hone ke naate bijepi ko dilli main sarkaar banane kaa mauka dene kii baat kahi thi
 At present, Najeeb Jung is out of Delhi and is going to return to Delhi by this evening, so BJP may get an invitation to form the government by Wednesday
 bijepi ne kaha he, dilli main hamaari sarkaar banegi, nyotaa milane ke baad gathan par vichaar karenge
 Significantly, President's rule has been in force in Delhi since the resignation of Arvind Kejriwal in February
 is bich aam aadmi party ke netaa manish sisodiya ne kaha he ki bijepi chunaav se dar rahi he or unke paas aankada nahin he
 He said that BJP has refused earlier, so how can it get invite now
 is mudde par arvind kejariwal ne twit kiya he ki bijepi chunaav se bhaag rahi he, kyonki use dilli main haar kaa dar he
 BJP is misleading the people of Delhi
 chaar baar sarkaar gathan ke liye vidhayakon ko kharidne kii koshish kii, lekin naakaam rahi, ab ye paanchavin baar he
 How the BJP will form the government, they do not have the necessary figures
 bijepi chunaav kyon nahin karaati
 At the same time, Independent MLA from Delhi, Rambir Shaukeen said that if the BJP has the maximum number of mlas, then they should get a chance to form the government

 The initial 4 years of Modi Raj got out of rest, but the final year (2018) proved to be extremely difficult for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government as they faced 'bharat Bandh' one after the other
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ko apane shasankaal ke antim saal main jitani chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, utana use shuruaati 3 saalon main nahin karnaa padaa tha
 a few months before the general election, the central government has been facing big challenges one after the other
 jaanate hai, 2018 main lagaataar ho rahebharat bandke bare main
 
 
 The violent Bharat Bandh of 2 April was held in Mododiraj this year, the first Bharat Bandh on 2 April
 supreme court kii ore se essi / asti act main badlaav ke khilaaf dalit sanghathanon ne deshbhar main pradarshan kiya, jo baad main hinsak hota chalaa gaya
 Dalit organizations and their supporters blocked trains and blocked roads in different cities of the country on the call for Bharat bandh
 uttar pradesh se lekar bihar, madhyapradesh or rajasthan samet kai rajyon main todphod, jam or aagjanee kii ghatnaayen saamne ai, lekin jaan-maal kaa kaaphi nuksaan bhi hua
 Around a dozen people lost their lives and 2 dozen people were injured in the widespread violence across the country
 madhya pradesh or rajasthan ke kai ilaakon main dinabhar sthiti behad kharaab rahi or logon ne jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 7 people died in MP, 2 in Uttar Pradesh and 1 in Rajasthan due to the protests
 barmer main ek hinsak jhadap main 25 log ghayal ho gaye
 The effect of this violent shutdown was so that Section 144 was kept in force in many areas for the next few days, with the Etihatan schools closed
 hinsa ke doshi kai hajaar logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 The Bharat Bandh of the upper castes on 10 April in protest against the changes in the SC / ST Act, 8 days after the Dalit organizations called for a Bharat bandh on 2 April, the Savarnas had organized a nationwide bandh in protest against the reservation
 2 april ko bharat band ko dauraan jamkar hinsa hui thi, jisase sabak lete hue grih mantralay ne is band ko dekhte hue sabhi rajyon ko kade nirdesh jari kiye or sakhti baratane ke liye kaha tha
 In view of the possible violence, Section 144 was imposed in many states
 band kaa asarbihar, uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh, punjab, rajasthan or kerala ke alaava kai rajyon me tha
 To prevent violence, the Home Ministry had deployed 30 paramilitary forces companies across the country, including 14 companies of paramilitary forces in Uttar Pradesh, 4 companies of CRPF in Madhya Pradesh, 8 companies of CRPF in Rajasthan and 4 companies of CRPF in Bihar
 Went
 haalanki ise sarkaar ke khilaaf bharat band kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 Against the government's decision, the upper castes made the Bharat Bandendra Modi government change the SC / ST to woo the scheduled castes and tribes, which angered the upper caste community living near them
 kai savarna sanghathanon ne essi / asti sanshodhan adhinium ke khilaaf 6 sitambar ko bharat band bulaayaa jo modiraj main chand maheenon main doosraa bada bharat band rahaa
 The impact of the Bharat Bandh of the upper castes was seen in many states including Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 bihar main kai jagahon par aagjanee bhi kii gai
 The resentment of the upper castes was seen most in Madhya Pradesh
 yahaan par sambhavit hinsa ko dekhte hue 10 jilon main band se pehle hi dhara 144 lagu laga di gai
 However, its impact was not seen in Uttar Pradesh
 bang se desh ke rajasav main karodon kaa nuksaan hua
 The first political India bandh on 10 September was held in Modiraj, the third Bharat Bharat Bandh in 2018, the first political Bharat Bandh which was called by the Congress and also received the support of more than 20 political parties
 congress ne desh main badhate petrol kii keemton or anya kai muddon ko sadak par le jane vaaste is band kaa aayojan kiya
 Congress President Ahul Gandhi also tried to position himself as the opposition leader with this bandh
 band ko vyapak samarthan bhi mila
 Especially from the opposition parties
 lekin is band se desh kii arthvyavastha ko 25 se 30 hajaar karod rupee ke nuksaan kii sambhaavna he
 The above 4 India is not only closed but for Modi Raj, the year of 2018 proved challenging due to many other movements
 kai kisaan andolan ne bhi sarkaar ko chintaa main daal diya
 The statewide farmer movement in Maharashtra in March also worried the central government
 isse pehle farvari main bhi kisaan andolan hua tha
 It is being said about Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the opposition coalition may prove to be baseless in front of him in the 2019 elections, because the opposition faction is not united in front of his image
 lekin agle saal chunaav main utarane se pehle 2018 main ek ke baad ek jis tarah se desh main halaat ban rahe hai usase lagata he ki modi or amit shah ko aage kii ranneeti banane ke liye nae sire se sochna hoga
 The government seems to be besieged by rising prices of petrol-diesel, increasing resentment of upper castes due to SC / ST Act, unemployment and many other issues
 vipaksh lagaataar sarkaar par hamalaa kar rahi he
 Now it remains to be seen what the modi-shah duo are able to do in the remaining 8 months before the general election so that they can face the opposition attacks
 america ko mandi se ubaarane kii ek or koshish karte hue ek maheene ke bheetar duusari baar america fedral rigerv ne byaaj dar main katautee kii he
 The Federal Reserve has cut the interest rate by one percent, after which it has come down to one percent
 pichley maheene tak ye dar 2 fisadi thi
 This deduction means that banks will now be able to get loans at a much cheaper rate
 kaarobaariyon ko shaayad fedral rigerv ke is kadam kii ummid pehle se hi thi
 Perhaps this is the reason why despite this cut in the US markets there was not much enthusiasm
 dou jones or standard or pier donon hi giravat ke saath band hue
 The Nasdaq also grew marginally
 maaruti sujuki indiyane ek baar phir desh main premium gadiyon kii market main sahabhaagita badhaane ke liye qamar kas lee he
 While Maruti has one vehicle per two cars sold in the country, the company is facing stiff competition from its Japanese rivals Honda and Toyota in the premium segment
 sutron ke mutabik is chunauti ko dekhte hue maaruti ne ab 9-10 lakh rupee or uske upar ke keemat kii gadiyon ko bechney ke liye nae management strecchar ke saath-saath nae dilarship network ko khadaa karne kaa faisla kiya he
 According to company sources, this new team has been formed by the company and inside the company it will be known as Nexa
 partho bannerjee, jo ki company ke cells or dealer network ke nae vaais president ko is nai team kii kaman di ja rahi he
 2 zonal heads and 8 regional heads will assist Banerjee in setting up a new dealership network
 company kii yah pahal toyota kii lexs or nisaan kii infinity dhaanche ko dekhte hue kii gai he
 So, like these two companies, it will be the responsibility of Maruti to sell luxury and 10 lakh expensive vehicles
 isse pehle bhi maaruti ne premium segment main apni pakad banane ke liye kai baar koshish kar chuki he lekin use zyada safalataa haath nahin lagi thi
 Recently, Maruti launched the Ciaz in the midsize range and had to stop selling sales of its premium sedan Kizashi a few years before the company received good response from the market
 aankadon ke mutabik desh main sabase zyada gaadiyaan bechney vaali company maaruti ko 10 lakh rupee se mahangi gaadi bechney main khaasi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 As a result, Maruti's sales in this segment are just 1-3% of the total sales
 company sutron ke mutabik nayaa dhaancha puri tarah se taiyaar ho jane ke baad is segment kii gadiyon ko bechney kaa kaam maujuuda dealer network ke madhyam se nahin kiya jayega
 Former Kolkata Mayor and Trinamool Congress MLA Sowan Chatterjee joined the BJP in New Delhi on Wednesday, causing a major setback to the Trinamool
 chatarji sakriy raajnneeti se dur ho gaye the
 The Trinamool was trying to bring him back into active politics again
 trinmul ke ek varisht ne kaha ki hamane kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki sowan antat: bhaajapa main shaamil ho jaaenge
 It is true that BJP leaders were in touch with him, but we never believed that he could cheat Mamata Banerjee whom he used to call mother
 ek anya trinmul netaa ne kaha ki unke (bhaajapa main) shaamil hone se dakshin 24 pargana jile main trinmul congress ke sanghathan par asar padegaa or isse agle saal hone vaale kolkata nagar nigam chunaavon par bhi asar padegaa
 The party also lacked his political and organizational skills in the Lok Sabha elections
 gauratlab he ki may main loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey ghoshit hone ke baad se trinmul congress ke chah vidhayakon, congress or makapa ke ek-ek vidhayak ne bhaajapa kaa daaman tham liya he
 The saffron party is trying to woo rival party leaders to increase its power in view of assembly elections in the state in 2021
 vidit ho ki bhaajapa ne loksabhaa chunaavon main pashchim bengal main 42 loksabhaa siton main se 18 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 According to Trinamool leaders, Banerjee played a key role in shaping Chatterjee's political career
 2016 vidhansabha chunaav main party kii jeet ke baad unhen teen ahm vibhaag saunpe gaye the, lekin chatarji ke nijee jivan main pareshaaniyon ke chalate pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne pichley saal november main unase trinmul congress sarkaar main mantri or kolkata ke mahayor donon padon se istipha dene ke liye kaha tha
 Chatterjee, sitting at the party headquarters with top BJP leaders in New Delhi, condemned the violence and unpopular atmosphere in the 2018 panchayat elections in the state
 chatarji, bhaajapa kii pashchim bengal ikai ke varisht netaa mukul roy or mahasachiv arun singh kii upasthiti main party main shaamil hue
 Welcoming Chatterjee, Roy said that he is one of the leaders who has made a major contribution to the rise of Banerjee for the post of Chief Minister
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki vah ab bhaajapa ko majboot karenge
 Let me reiterate that the Trinamool Congress will not get the status of an opposition party either
 is bich, trinmul ne bhi kaha ki chatarji ko party se nishkasit kiya jayega
 a senior Trinamool leader said on condition of keeping his identity confidential that he would be expelled from the Trinamool Congress
 party ne is sambandh main abhi antim ghoshnaa nahin kii he
 Chatterjee's friend and Trinamool leader Baisakhi Banerjee also joined the BJP
 pashchim bengal bhaajapa adhyaksh dilip ghosh ne kaha ki chatarji ke shaamil hone se party majboot hogi or unhone daawa kiya vidhayakon samet banerjee kii party ke kai anya netaa bhi bhagava dal main shaamil honge
 Ghosh told reporters here that we welcome Chatterjee to the party
 unke shaamil hone se bhavishya main party or majboot hogi

 Dr Jailed in case of death of children due to lack of oxygen at BRD Hospital, Gorakhpur
 kapheel ne ek khat likhaa he
 In this letter, he has written that he was made a scapegoat for the massive administrative failure
 18 april ko likhaa gaya ye khat unki patni shabista ne shanivaar ko press club of india main puri media ko jari kiya
 Jailed since September 2, 2017 kapheel ne kai gambhir aarope lagane ke saath-saath ek baar phir se khud ko begunaah bataaya
 Dr
 kapheel khaanne khat main likhaa he ki 10 agast kii us bhayanak raat jab whatsap par mujhe oxigen khatm hone kii khabar mili, to fouran maine wo sab kiya jo ek doctor, pita or desh ke jimmedaar naagarik ko karnaa chahie
 i tried my best to save the children suffering from oxygen deficiency
 maine sabhi logon ko phone kiya, maine khudoxigen kaa orderkia
 i could do whatever i could
 maine echodi, biardi ke principal, acting principal, gorakhpur ke dm sabhi ko kol kiya
 Told everyone about the seriousness of the situation
 maine apane doston ko bhi phone kar unase madad lee
 In order to save the lives of children, i went to the gas cylinder supplier for prayers
 maine kuch paison kaa intjaam kar kaha ki baaki paisa silendar mil jane ke baad pe kar diya jayega
 i was running from one ward to another to save the children
 puri koshish kar rahaa tha ki kahin bhi oxigen supplai kii kami na ho
 i drove myself to arrange a cylinder from a nearby hospital
 khat main dow
 Kafeel said that i spoke to the SSB DIG
 unhone kaaphi madad kii
 He not only provided trucks to bring cylinders, but also sent some soldiers along
 iske liye unka shukriya
 Along with removing the lack of oxygen, we worked as a team at that time
 kapheel ne bataaya ki 13 agast kii subah yogi maharaj aspataal aae the
 He asked me if you were the Dr
 kapheel hai jinhone silendar kaa intjaam kiya? maine haa kahaan to ve mujh par bhadak gaye
 He said that after arranging the cylinder, you felt that you would become a hero? i see it is puri ghatana ke bare main media ko pataa chal jane se yogi ji gusse main the
 i had not told the media anything, rather they had reached themselves
 iske baad se mere parivaar ko tang kiya jane laga
 The police started coming home
 mujhe dhamkee di jane lagi
 My family was scared of all these things
 parivaar ko bachaane ke liye maine sarender kiya
 How did i feel when i did nothing wrong? i thought there would be justice, but many months passed
 mujhe lag rahaa tha ki mujhe bel mil jaaegi, lekin ab mujhe lag rahaa ki nyaaypalika dabaav main kaam kar rahi he
 Along with me, my family's life has also become hell
 meri beti ek saal 7 maheene kii ho gai he
 i couldn't even celebrate his birthday
 10 agast ko chuttee hone ke baavjood jaise hi maine ye khabar suni, main bhaag kar aspataal gaya
 i was the most junior doctor in the hospital
 main to NHRM main nodel afasar tha
 i used to teach students as a lecturer in paediatrics
 silendar kharid, tender, order or pement, is puri prakriya main main kahin bhi shaamil nahin tha
 In such a situation, Pushpa Sales stopped giving cylinders, so how can i be responsible for this? Dr
 kapheel ne saaf shabdon main kaha ki iske liye gorakhpur ke DM, DGME, health or ajukeshan ke principal secretary doshi hai
 No action was taken even after 14 reminders for Pushpa Sales' 68 lakh outstanding payment
 yah bade str par prashasnic naakaami he
 i was made a sacrificial goat
 jaanboojh kar ham logon ko jail main daalaa gaya, taaki sachai isi jail ke andar hi rah jaae
 Dr
 Kafil hoped in the letter that he too would get the vine and would be able to live with his daughter and family
 ek asahaay pita, pati, bhai, putr or dost

 On the advice of his trusted numerologist, 76-year-old BS Yeddyurappa has once again started using the actual spelling of his name
 teen baar karnataka ke mukhyamantri bane yediurppa kabhi bhi apana kaarykaal puraa nahin kar sake
 Yeddyurappa, who last became chief minister for only two days in 2018, does not want to take any risk in his fourth innings
 yeddi ke naam se mashhoor yediurppa ne shuukravaar ko akele shapath lee
 BJP President Amit Shah wanted to proceed cautiously to form the government in Karnataka but the emotional Yeddyurappa called him at midnight and said that this would be his 'last chance to become Chief Minister'
 'udupi-chikmagalore loksabhaa seat se saansad 'madam shobhaa' yaa shobhaa karandalaaje jinhen yediurppa kaa kareebi bhi mana jaataa he, ne bhi amit shah se lagaataar karnataka main sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne kii taarikh tay karne ke liye lagaataar kahati raheen
 Amit Shah was annoyed and told him in Parliament that he has more work to do, he cannot focus only on Karnataka
 'is bich, yediurppa ke bengalooru sthit ghar par kai tarah kii puja huin or tumkur jile main sthit unke gaanv main 24 ghante ke havan kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 Apart from persuading Shah, Yeddyurappa also approached astrologers, numerologists and tarot card readers to ensure that he could complete his term as the Chief Minister of Karnataka
 bijepi main anaupchaarik rup se ritayament kii umr 75 varsh he or amit shah ke netritv main ise lagu bhi kiya gaya he
 Yeddyurappa was an exception to this, even while taking oath after the Karnataka assembly elections in May last year
 sutron ne bataaya ki, 'jis din gathbandhan sarkaar kaa shapathgrahan hua tha, usee din se yediurppa ne athak parishram kiya
 In the past year, he has launched Operation Lotus at least six times
 (aalochakon ke anusaar oparation lotus vah ranneeti he jiske tahat bijepi vidhayakon ko apni taraf khinchakar sarkarein giraane kaa kaam karti he)
 This time with a little help from Congress leader Siddaramaiah, Yeddyurappa managed to succeed
 agar party unhen karnataka main sarkaar banane dene ko raji nahin hoti, to yediurppa rajya main party ko barbaad kar dete
 'sources reveal,' After the initial na-nukur, Shah agreed - despite not showing a clear majority figure - because the BJP needs to be seen as an all-india party with its government in South India as well
 shah or pradhanmantri narendra modi bijepi ko raajnneeti ke prabhavi dhruv ke rup main dekhte hai or dakshin main party kii sarkaar is pariklpana main madadgaar hogi
 This is certainly another form of BJP led by Amit Shah, as Yeddyurappa was forced to resign in 2008 over the Rs 1000 crore illegal mining scam
 un dinon kendriya netritv ke saath yediurppa ke rishte achche nahin the
 Today, Yeddyurappa, Shah and Modi are all seen standing together
 jab vidhayakon ko todane or unhen nijee vimaan se le jane kii baat he to party ke paas sansadhano kii koi kami nahin he
 There are rumors that the mlas have raised money for unimaginable amounts as the BJP systematically destroyed the majority of the congress-janata Dal Secular
 congress ke kai netaa kehete hai ki bijepi ne paise kaa istemaal kar or inakam tex va sibiai jaisi kendriya agenciyon kii jaanch kii dhamkee dekar gathbandhan ko barbaad kar diya
 There are also rumors that former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who has a fierce rivalry with HD Deve Gowda and his son HD Kumaraswamy, made his dossier Yeddyurappa available to the mlas he was targeting
 congress-jedies gathbandhan ke bahumat sabit nahin kar paane ke do din baad shuukravaar ko yediurppa ne rajyapal vajubhai vaala se mulaakaat kar kaha ki vah aaj shaam thik chah baje shapath lenaa chaahate hai kyonki yah unke liye sabase shubh ghadi he
 Yeddyurappa's astrologers told him that the ominous clock would pass at four in the evening
 spasht he ki yediurppa kaa samay aa gaya or mukhyamantri banane kaa unka sapana saakaar hua
 The voters of Karnataka who saw the worst form of horse-trading, should now pray for good administration
 uttari kashmir ke baraamula jile main ugravadiyon ne ek vishesh police adhikari kii hatya kar di or sena ke ek jawan ko ghayal kar diya

 The campaign for Lok Sabha elections 2019 is in top gear
 is bich congress netaa or mumbai north central se party candidet priya dutt ne kaha he ki maujuuda vakt main bollywood dar ke maare sarkaar kaa samarthan kar rahaa he
 Priya Dutt was a Congress MP from Mumbai North Central
 priya dutt ne bollywood kalakaaron main sarkaar kaa samarthan karne ke badhate trend par baat kii
 Priya, who is contesting the Lok Sabha elections from the VIP seat of Mumbai, said that you do not think the fear factor is working behind the support of the government and not something else
 priya dutt ne kaha, "sabhi log prabhavit hue hai, har naagarik ko adhikaar he ki wo apni raay jaahir kare, ham log unhen prabhaav daalane vaale kah sakate hai, unhen apni raay rakhane kaa haq he
 "when asked Priya Dutt that these days there is a kind of competition among Bollywood actors to talk about the government, to support it
 iske jawaab main priya dutt ne kaha, "kya aap nahin sochate hai iske peeche duusari vajahon se zyada feare factor kaaran he
 "he was once again asked, do you really believe that the fear factor is working
" is par priya dutt ne kaha, "main to isi tarah se sochati hum, nahin to is tarah kaa achaanak badlaav kyon hota?"actor sunil dutt or abhinetri naragis kii beti priya dutt ne pehle chunaav na ladane kii ichha jaahir kii thi
 But later she agreed to enter the electoral battle
 vahiin priya dutt ke bhai sanjay dutt ne chunaav ladane kii afvaahon ko khaarij kar diya he
 Sanjay Dutt said that he will support his sister Priya Dutt in the election but will not contest the election himself
 bataa den ki haal hi main abhinetri kangana ranut, actor anupam kher, vivek obaroy jaise kai abhinayta piem narendra modi kaa samarthan kar chuke hai

 Mahendra Singh is raising questions about Dhoni's captaincy after losing the second one-day match against Bangladesh as well, and the media is repeatedly questioning whether Dhoni should resign from the captaincy taking responsibility for the defeat
 mujhe lagata he ham logon main yah ek trend ban gaya he ki jab bhi koi captain ek-do match yaa series haar jaataa he to uski captaini ko lekar sawaal uthaae jate hai, jo galat he
 The team that played well won
 agar dekha jaae to bangladesh kii team bharat se behatar kheli or isiilie vah jite
 Anyway, the Bangladeshi team is playing in front of the home audience at their home ground, whose psychological advantage is like every other team
 bharat bhi jab apane gharelu maidaanon par kheltaa he, to badi-badi tiimon ko haraane main kaamyaab rahaa he
 On the other hand, Bangladesh's team is also in good form
 kuch hi din pehle jab bangladesh ne pakistan ko shrunkhlaa main 3-0 se haraaya tha, tab pakistan ke captain azhar ali ne to istipha nahin diya tha
 If we talk about Dhoni as just batsman, then in yesterday's match, Dhoni promoted himself in the batting order and scored the highest number of 47 runs
 ham sabhi yah bhi bhul chuke hai ki kuch din pehle world cap ke dauraan dhoni kii captaini main bharat kii team shandaar pradarshan karte hue semi-final tak pahunchi thi, so, agar ek yaa do match yaa ek series haarane ke baad koi captain istipha de degaa to phir captaini koun karegaa
 If Virat Kohli becomes captain and loses one or two matches, will he be asked to resign as well
 agar record ke najariye se dekhen, to mahendra singh dhoni bharat ke behtareen captain hai
 Dhoni captained 180 matches, out of which he has won 100 matches, in 65 he has suffered defeat, while 15 have had no result
 is lihaaz se puure khele gaye maichon main dhoni kii jeet kaa pratishat 60
 Has been 35
 bharat kii ore jin khilaadiyon ne bhi 50 se zyaada maichon main captaini kii he, unamem dhoni kaa jeet pratishat sabase zyaada he
 The comments agar batsman ke najariye se dekha jaae, to bhi dhoni bharat ke behtareen ek-divasiy ballebaaj hai
 Dhoni's average in odis is around 53, which is more than any Indian batsman, and Dhoni is also at number six worldwide in terms of average
 
 
 
 And then we must not forget that Dhoni is the only captain of India, under whose leadership Team India has won the ICC World Cup, T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy
 agar dekha jaae to bangladesh kii team bharat se behatar kheli or isiilie vah jite
 Anyway, the Bangladeshi team is playing in front of the home audience at their home ground, whose psychological advantage is like every other team
 bharat bhi jab apane gharelu maidaanon par kheltaa he, to badi-badi tiimon ko haraane main kaamyaab rahaa he

 If we talk about Dhoni as just batsman, then in yesterday's match, Dhoni promoted himself in the batting order and scored the highest number of 47 runs
 ham sabhi yah bhi bhul chuke hai ki kuch din pehle world cap ke dauraan dhoni kii captaini main bharat kii team shandaar pradarshan karte hue semi-final tak pahunchi thi, so, agar ek yaa do match yaa ek series haarane ke baad koi captain istipha de degaa to phir captaini koun karegaa
 If Virat Kohli becomes captain and loses one or two matches, will he be asked to resign as well
 agar record ke najariye se dekhen, to mahendra singh dhoni bharat ke behtareen captain hai
 Dhoni captained 180 matches, out of which he has won 100 matches, in 65 he has suffered defeat, while 15 have had no result
 is lihaaz se puure khele gaye maichon main dhoni kii jeet kaa pratishat 60
 Has been 35
 bharat kii ore jin khilaadiyon ne bhi 50 se zyaada maichon main captaini kii he, unamem dhoni kaa jeet pratishat sabase zyaada he
 The comments agar batsman ke najariye se dekha jaae, to bhi dhoni bharat ke behtareen ek-divasiy ballebaaj hai
 Dhoni's average in odis is around 53, which is more than any Indian batsman, and Dhoni is also at number six worldwide in terms of average
 
 
 
 And then we must not forget that Dhoni is the only captain of India, under whose leadership Team India has won the ICC World Cup, T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy
 udhar, bangladesh kii team acchhee form main bhi chal rahi he
 a few days ago, when Bangladesh beat Pakistan 3–0 in the series, then Pakistan captain Azhar Ali did not resign
 agar dhoni kii sirf ballebaaj ke taur par baat karen, to dhoni ne kal ke match main khud ko batting order main pramot karke chauthe number par khelte hue sabase zyada 47 ran banaae
 We have also forgotten that a few days ago during the World Cup, under the captaincy of Dhoni, India's team reached the semi-finals by performing brilliantly, so if a captain resigns after losing one or two matches or a series
 Who will give captaincy then
 agar viraat kohli captain ban jate hai or ek-do match haar jate hai, to kya unase bhi istipha maanga jayega
 If we look at the record, Mahendra Singh Dhoni is India's best captain
 dhoni ne 180 maichon main captaini kii, jinamein se unhone 100 match jite hai, 65 main unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he, jabaki 15 kaa koi nateeja nahin aayaa
 In this sense, Dhoni's win percentage of 60 matches played
 35 rahaa he
 Dhoni has the highest win percentage among the players who have captained more than 50 matches for India
 tippaniyan Even from a batsman's point of view, Dhoni is still India's best one-day batsman
 van-de maichon main dhoni kaa ausat kareeb 53 he, jo kisi bhi bhartiya ballebaaj se zyaada he or vishwa bhar main bhi dhoni ausat ke maamle main chathe number par he
 
 
 
 or phir hamen yah bhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki dhoni bharat ke ekmaatr aise captain hai, jinke netritv main team india ne isisi world cap, tii-20 world cap or isisi champions trophy jiti he

 During this time, he also made a big statement on contesting his election, saying that if his brother and party president Rahul Gandhi would say, then he is ready to contest from Varanasi
 priyanka gandhi ne kaha, "agar rahul gandhi kahenge to main chunaav ladane ke liye taiyaar hum or main varanasi se laduungi
 "prime Minister Narendra Modi is contesting from Varanasi
 isse pehle bhi kai baar priyanka gandhi varanasi se chunaav ladane ko lekar bayaan de chuki hai
 This time everyone's eye on Wayanad Congress President Rahul Gandhi is trying his luck from Kerala's Wayanad seat
 vah amethi or vynad donon seat se maidan main hai
 Rahul Gandhi contends that he is contesting from Wayanad to give a message to South India, while the Bharatiya Janata Party is saying that there is a fear of defeat in Amethi, hence contesting from a seat where the majority is a minority
 lekin agar samikarnon ko dekhen to rahul kii najar kerala kii sabhi 20 siton par he, jis tarah uttar bharat ko bijepi kaa garh mana jaataa he, vaise hi dakshin bharat main congress kaa jaadu chalata he

 "the goal of my life is the Olympic Gold Medal," Sindhu said many years ago, when she was just 15 years old *** haryana main 'ek or sudhaar kaarykram' ke nideshak rocky mittal ne ek or vivaadaaspad gaanaa banaaya he
 In this song, Mittal has targeted Rahul Gandhi and called him a child
 is gane main rahul ke sansad main aankh maarane par bhi tanj ksaa gaya he
 Rocky Mittal claims that this song has been seen by all the big leaders of BJP and has also received more than 70 lakh views as soon as the song has been uploaded on youtube
 rocky mittal ne teji se viral hue apane is gane ko relies karne ke liye chandigarh press club ko chunaa he jahaan vah is gane ko relies karne vaale hai
 The song uses many controversial words for Rahul Gandhi
 is gane main unhen kam akl vaale vyakti kii sangya di gai he
 Reacting to the song, former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the song actually reflects the thinking and character of the BJP, which uses such language towards the president and MP of a national party
 unhone kaha ki yah behad nindaneey he
 At the same time, Rocky Mittal says that he has written this song as truth and telling the story of a real character
 philhal gane ko lekar haryana kii raajnneetik galiyaaron main maahaul garm he
 Let me tell you that this is not the first song by Rocky Mittal which has been controversial
 isse pehle bhi vah apane gaanon main is tarah kii shabdaawalee kaa istemaal kar chuke hai
 Earlier, he composed a song for Congress leader and Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, after which there was a lot of ruckus
 dilli kii kejariwal kranti kabhi apano se ulajh rahi he kabhi dusron se
 All the forts like Kejriwal are bent on conquering, but after every fort their image is shining somewhat
 philhal wo dilli main apane haq kii ladaai lard rahe hai
 But those who fight for the rights should avoid attacking others undeservedly
 sammaan paane kii pehali shart ye hoti he ki aap dusron kaa sammaan karen
 Kejriwal wants all the rights, all the respect but does not want to give to others
 dilli ke maujuuda jhagade main bhi unka yahi rukh dikhataa he
 He started accusing Shakuntala Gamlin of colliding with Najeeb Jung and after the notification of the Central Government came down on the language like Queen Victoria and Viceroy
 ek rajya ke chune hue mukhyamantri ko ye shobhaa nahin detaa
 Of course, Delhi should get its rights and the Delhi Legislative Assembly and the government should have the administrative powers that other legislatures and governments have
 lekin ye ladaai raajnneeti or loktantr ke daayre main hi ladi ja sakati he
 Kejriwal often starts telling this democracy its limits in his own way
 ve sting, sakht kanoon or sakht karrwai kii baat bahut karte hai, lekin achaanak apano ke prati saday ho jate hai
 While accusing others, they do not care what the court has said about them, but begin to argue the court's decision about any of their mlas or ministers
 tippaniyan Of course, these are small political tricks which are more visible to his opponents than Kejriwal
 lekin tab dilli kii janata ne kisi duusare par itnaa bharosa nahin jataayaa he jitna kejariwal par jataayaa he
 If Kejriwal tried to create a scale of political sanctity, he would have to follow it
 tab jo takat unhen kanoonee baadhyataaen nahin de raheen, ve unhen apni shakhsiyat se hasil kar paaenge
 The difficulty is that often the mirror of the hope falls from the height, the more loud it sounds
 kahawat puraani he ki krantiyaan sabase pehle apane bacchon ko kha jaati hai
 Kejriwal also has to prove this saying wrong
 lekin jo haq kii ladaai ladate hai unhen naahak dusron par hamalaa karne se bachanaa chahie
 The first condition for getting respect is that you respect others
 kejariwal saare haq, sara sammaan chaahate hai lekin dusron ko nahin dena chaahate
 This is also his attitude in the current quarrel in Delhi
 najeeb jang se takaraate-takaraate wo shakuntla gamelin par aarope lagane lage or centre sarkaar kii adhisuchana ke baad queen victoria or vysarai jaisi bhashaa par utar aae
 It does not suit the elected Chief Minister of a state
 beshak, dilli ko uskaa haq milanaa chahie or dilli vidhansabha or sarkaar ke paas ve prashasnic adhikaar hone chahie jo duusari vidhansabhaon or sarkaron ke paas hote hai
 But this fight can only be fought within the realm of politics and democracy
 kejariwal aksar apane andaaz se is loktantr ko uski simaaen bataane lagate hai
 They talk a lot about sting, strict laws and strict action, but suddenly become loyal to their loved ones
 dusron par aarope lagaate hue ve ye parvaah nahin karte ki adaalat ne unke bare main kya kaha he, lekin apane kisi vidhayak yaa mantri ke bare main adaalat ke faisale kii daleel dene lagate hai
 The comments beshak, ye choti-moti raajnneetik chaalen hai jo kejariwal se zyaada unke virodhiyon ke yahaan dikhaai padati hai
 But then the people of Delhi have not expressed confidence in anyone as much as Kejriwal
 kejariwal ne raajnneetik shuchita kaa ek paimaana banane kii koshish kii, to is par unhen amal bhi karnaa hoga
 Then the power which is not giving them legal obligations, they will be able to achieve them with their personality
 mushkil ye he ki aksar ummid kaa aainaa jitani oonchai se girtaa he, utane hi jor kii awaz karata he
 The old saying goes that revolutions eat their children first
 kejariwal ko is kahawat ko bhi galat sabit karnaa he

 anusuchit jati evam janajati act par supreme court ke faisle ke virodh main dalit sanghathanon ke bharat band ke dauraan somvaar ko jab jamkar tandav machaa to sarkaar ke maano kaan khadey ho gaye
 However, to calm the anger of Dalits, the government reached the Supreme Court on Monday with a review petition
 sutron kaa kahana he ki mangalvaar ko atarni general keke venugopal rivyuu pitishan par supreme court se jald sunwaayee karne kii guhaar lagaayenge
 Significantly, the Supreme Court on Monday refused to take an immediate hearing
 haalanki court punarvichaar yachika par sunwaayee karne ko taiyaar he
 In fact, the central government has demanded the Supreme Court to restore the former position in the Nerview Petition
 jiske tahat essi / asti act ke tahat koi bhi aparaadh gaiyr-jamaanti shrenee main mana jayega

 The Azad Central Government has no interest in the interest of Dalits
 isliye supreme court kii bajaay sarkaar ke kaaran ye SC-ST act kamjor hua

 In the case, the government has said that in the petition on which the Supreme Court has decided on the SC / ST Act, the government was not a party
 mantralay ne kaha he ki kaanoon bananaa supreme court kaa nahin balki sansad kaam he
 The government believes that the court can revoke the law only on the basis of three facts - first, fundamental rights are violated
 - doosraa, kanoon galat banaaya gaya ho
 Third, if the right to make any law does not come under the jurisdiction of Parliament
 sarkaar kii ye bhi daleel hai ki court ye nahin kah saktaa hai ki kanoon kaa swaroop kaisaa ho kyonki kanoon banane kaa adhikaar sansad ke paas he
 Also, Parliament has the right to make any law strong
 samasamyik aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye kaisaa kanoon bane ye sansad yaa vidhansabha tay karti he
 Apparently the government has made its stand clear

 The court reiterated the Supreme Court's earlier judgment on economic offenses

 Money in money laundering revolves in many countries
 isaki vaigyanik or pukhta jaanch jaruri he
 Letter of Rogatory has also been sent
 agar agrim jamaanat di gai to jaanch prabhavit hogi
 This is not an improper case
 ''bataa den ki chidambaram niyamit jamaanat kii arji de sakate hai
 The court said, "economic crime is a different category of crime, it should be looked at differently

 akhilesh yadav jab jeet kar aae the to unase bahut ummiden thim
 His youthful zeal, affable nature and his zeal to do something made him the Chief Minister of the country's largest state
 unke aane ke baad ek baar to aisa laga ki ab yah rajya sudhar jayega
 But dreams were broken on sight and this state has become the biggest example of anarchy and misrule today
 aaj is rajya main aparaadhon kaa graph haroonges dhang se upar he or aparaadhiyon kii ban ai he
 The biggest example of this is the gang-rape and murder of two minor sisters in collusion with the policemen
 yah dil dahala dene vaali ghatana badaayun ke ushait main hui or isane puure desh ko sharmasaar kar diya
 The government which promised good governance is now silent and Akhilesh is merely ordering an inquiry
 yah ghatana isliye bhi bhayanak he ki isamen police vaale bhi mili hue hai or unhone ise dabaane kii koshish kii he
 Not only this, all the criminals belong to the caste of Chief Minister and hence this matter is quite serious
 jis dussahas se gundon ne police waalon ke saath milakar is aparaadh ko anjaam diya uski misaal milani mushkil he
 This type of incident suggests that misrule is born when casteism orgy takes place
 saare desh main is ghatana kii ninda ho rahi he or videshi media bhi ise pramukhataa se prakashit kar rahaa he lekin sarkaar karrwai ke naam par abhi aisa kuch nahin kar paa rahi he jisase lage ki rajya main sushasan laane ke liye akhilesh yadav vachanabaddh hai
 Only five of the seven accused have been caught by the police so far, it seems that the police system has also ended
 uttar pradesh main is sarkaar ke aane ke baad halaat bigade hai or iskaa hi nateeja he ki naaraaz janata ne sattarudh dal se kinaaraa kar liya he
 The people, who had won the SP with an absolute majority, were so against them that the party was almost wiped out in the Lok Sabha elections and Mulayam Singh Yadav's dream of becoming Prime Minister was lost

 They feel that work will be done from all over
 mujffarnagar main itnaa bada danga hua or usamen bhi sakht karrwai nahin hui
 The government did not learn any lesson from that incident and did not take any major step to strengthen law and order
 darasal uttar pradesh main satta ke kai centre ban gaye hai or sabhi vahaan apni chalaa rahe hai
 There is a crowd of sycophants and selfish elements who probably do not allow the Chief Minister to work
 ab is ghatana se akhilesh yadav koi sikh lenge yaa nahin, yah to vakt hi batayega lekin itnaa tay he ki uttar pradesh aaj desh kaa sabase 'kushasit' rajya he or yahaan sakht karrwai kii jarurat he
 Assembly elections are still far away and the Chief Minister may not react as much, but the wounds of this incident are very deep which will continue to ache for many years

 ’sutron ne daawa kiya ki unki bhoomika se sabit ho jayega ki har safal aadmi ke peeche kisi aurat kaa haath hota he
