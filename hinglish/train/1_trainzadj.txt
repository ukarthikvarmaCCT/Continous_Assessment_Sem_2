 Presenting the January progress report of his ministry, Chidambaram said in response to questions from reporters, "the decision was taken by majority

 Significantly, the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, a member of the CVC appointment panel, had expressed her objection in the name of Thomas and also expressed her opposition in writing

 But i find this thing frightening
 main isse kada shabd nahin khoj paa rahaa hum ki adaalat main sakriyata se vichaar kiye ja rahe maamle par khule taur par raajnneetik dal or media charchaa kar rahe hai

 ‘chidambaram ne kaha ki chayan samiti kii baithak main charchaa hui or phir ‘minutes’ likhe gayi, jis par sushamaa ne likhaa he ki ‘vah asahmat hai
 This means that he disagrees with the opinion of the other two members
 ‘swaabhaavik rup se koi mahatvapurn baat hui hogi, jis par sushamaa asahmat rahi hongi
 There must have been a discussion on a topic, there must have been a discussion on the name and it would have taken a long time, then there was talk of disagreement

 The Delhi KCAG report has revealed a big problem regarding rationing

 If sources are to be believed, more than 50 such cases have been reported in the CAG report so far, where the rules were violated and the disturbances were carried out

 He took a dig at the Kejriwal government accusing him of doing the ration card scam, and asked the public to play a spoof of the ravaged Teladilli, who was sarcastically slaughtered, in this fashion
 vahiin is maamle mempurv mantri kapil mishrane bhi kejariwal sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa
 He tweeted that there was an attempt to adjust the ration of Rs 150 crore per month with 4 lakh fake ration cards

 For this dinner, along with the leaders of opposition parties, some of his colleagues who are angry with the BJP are also being invited to invite
 ‘india today conklev 2018’ main bolte hue sonia gandhi 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main congress yaa congress nit gathbandhan kii satta main vaapasi ko lekar puri tarah aashwast dikhin
 Sonia said, 'we are going to come back
 ham unhen satta main dobaaraa nahin aane denge
 The Congress leader also hinted at some opposition within his party on the national level alliance
 sonia ne kaha, ‘ye hamaari party samet sabhi partiyon ke liye mushkil kaam he ki rashtriya str par muddon ko lekar saath aaen
 We are hostile at the ground level
 yahaan tak ki hamaari party main bhi virodh he
 This is a difficult task
 ’kya sonia kii baat rahul sunate hai?ye puche jane par ki kya rahul gandhi ke congress adhyaksh ban jane ke baad aap unhen salaah detii hai, sonia gandhi ne kaha, ‘wo apni jimmedaariyon ke bare main jaanate hai
 And I'm there for any advice
 ’lekin rahul gandhi kya unki sunate hai, is sawaal ke jawaab main sonia gandhi ne kaha,’ perent ke naate ham unhen (bacchon ko) control karne kii koshish karte hai

 Asked about the working methods of Rahul Gandhi, Sonia said, "every person has his own special way of working
" saath hi congress kii ek nishchit niti he, jiskaa ham paalan karte hai
 Sonia said, "what Rahul has always aspired for is to make the party powerful, as well as to connect young and new people together
" lekin iskaa ye matlab nahin he ki puraane logon ko haashie par daal diya jaae
 There is also a complete focus of balance

" ham niyamit taur par samaan vichaardhaara vaali partiyon ke saath baithken karte hai
 Let us see what can be done in this direction

 On the shrinking of Congress's presence in several states one after the other, Sonia Gandhi said, "we were in government for two terms and there were definitely some anti-incumbency trends, but in 2014 we fell behind in campaigning
" ham us chunaav prachaar kaa muqabla nahin kar paae jo modi ke tahat unke liye hua
 In response to the question whether corruption was the main issue in 2014, Sonia said, it was an issue but it was presented exaggeratedly
 misaal ke taur par 2G ko lijie, purv sieji ne bahut badi rakam bataai
 Now everyone knows that it was offered exaggeratedly
 ek aise vyakti ko jo incharge rahaa, use ritairement ke baad kaise mahatvapurn pad diya ja saktaa he
 Comparing Prime Minister Modi to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Sonia Gandhi said, "the current situation is that there is no one who gives space to others
 sansad main bolnaa hamaara adhikaar he
 Vajpayee had great respect for parliamentary procedures
 ’sonia gandhi ne vaajapeyi sarkaar ke ‘shining india’ or bijepi ke ‘achche din’ campagne ke bich tulana karte hue kaha, ‘bijepi ke saath mukhya mudda ye he ki wo bade, lubhaavne vaade karte hai lekin amal main kya laayaa gaya

 25% of marital couples around the world fail to produce children
 yah kahana he izonomics kii doctor rajani khajuriya kaa
 Khajuria says that for couples, these couples resort to artificial insemination

 Khajuria said that 25 per cent of couples worldwide are unable to conceive naturally, so they are able to give birth with assisted reproductive techniques such as IVF, but this task is not so easy
 iske liye sahi samay or sahi paddati kaa hona jaruri he
 Selecting IVF is not less than climbing mountains for any couple, as IVF has seen many cases where women have suffered miscarriages or failed IVF even after successful implantation

 agar chromosomel asaamanyataon ke baad bhi bachein kaa janm ho paata he to aisi asaamanyataon vaala baccha maansik yaa shaareerik rup se paripakv nahin hota he
 The second reason, one of the reasons for IVF failure, is not maturing the lining of the uterus, for example, polycystic ovarian syndrome (p

 dakshin africa se swadesh lautne ke baad sarfaraj ne kaha ki unhen apni galati kaa ahsaas hua or isiilie unhone is prakaran ke turant baad saarvajanik rup se maafee maangi
 Speaking to reporters, Sarfaraz said, "it was a mistake and i have learned a lesson from it

 The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) expressed disappointment over the icc's decision
 nilamban ke baad nishane par aae sarfaraj ahamed ke samarthan main utre wasim akram
 
 sarfaraj ne is samarthan ke liye board kaa shukriya kiya
 He said, 'I am thankful to him for the way the PCB dealt with this matter

 Now the Indian team is eyeing the ODI series
 team india ke purv mahendra singh dhoni lambey samay ke baad maidan par vaapasi kar rahe hai
 Earlier Dhoni was seen in ODI series against West Indies
 ab srilanka ke khilaaf vanade siries shuru hone vaali he or phens ek baar phir dhoni ke helicopter shot dekhne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Let's take a look at what records Dhoni can make during the ODI series against Sri Lanka
 vanade main stamping kaa shatak lagane vaale duniya ke pehle ballebajdhoni behtareen ballebaaj to hai hi, lekin wicketcaping main bhi unka koi jawaab nahin
 Dhoni is sometimes compared to 4G for his agility behind the wicket, and Jamaican runner Usain Bolt
 maahi is samay apni 100waan vanade stamping se keval 3 kadam dur hai
 With this, he will overtake Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara (97) in the most stumping
 is siries ke dauraan dhoni vanade main 100 stamping karne vaale duniya ke akele wicketiper ban sakate hai
 In the ODI, 'triple century' Dhoni, the most senior player of current team India, will complete his 300 odis by playing 4 more matches in this series
 23 disambar 2014 ko vanade main debyue karne vaale dhoni ab tak 296 match khel chuke hai
 Dhoni will become the sixth Indian player to achieve this feat after playing the 300th match, after Sachin Tendulkar (463), Rahul Dravid (340), Mohammad Azharuddin (334), Sourav Ganguly (308) and Yuvraj Singh (301)
 ardhashtakon kaa shatkamahendra singh dhoni is samay apane 100 antarrashtriya ardhashatak puure karne se 2 kadam dur hai, yani do or ardhashatak lagaate hi dhoni antarrashtriya cricket main 100 ardhashatak lagane vaale 14wein khilaadi ban jaaenge
 Also, Dhoni will become the fourth Indian batsman to score 100 fifties after Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly
 vanade main 9500 randhoni ne pichley saal newjiland ke khilaaf mohali main khele gaye vanade match main apane 9,000 vanade ran puure kiye the or ab maahi 9,500 ke aankade se keval 4 ran dur hai
 Dhoni, the sixth batsman to have scored the highest number of runs since debut, stepped into the ODI from the match against Bangladesh on 23 December 2014, playing consecutive match-winning innings for Team India
 dhoni ne debyue match se lekar ab tak kul 15,583 ran banaae hai
 At the same time, if Dhoni scores 12 more runs, he will become the sixth batsman to score the highest runs since December 23
 dhoni australia ke maaikel clork (15,594) ko peeche chhod denge
 Film Name: Rabtadirector: Dinesh Visionstar Cast: Sushant Singh Rajput, Kriti Sanon, Rajkumar Rao, Jim Sarbh, Varun Sharma Duration: 2 hours 34 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 2
 5 starcocktail, agent vinod, hindi medium jaisi kai sari filmon ko produs karne ke baad ab dinesh vijan ne diarection main bhi haath aajamaaya he or unhone 'rabta' film ko diarect kiya he
 The film stars Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon together with Love Stroy based on reincarnation relationships
 jise lekar kaaphi controvarsi bhi hui ki ye south kii film 'magadhira' kii copy he
 But that case also came in favor of Rabta
 aaj relies hui rabta kii kahani kisi he aaie jaane
 The story of the censor board scissors, vulgar language and kissed delitkahani film on 'rabta' begins in Punjab where the family of Shiv Kakkar (sushant Singh Rajput) comes to drop him off at the airport as his job is stuck in the bank of Budapest
 
 flert karne main number van shiv budapest pahunchate hi ek chocolate store par syra singh (kriti sinan) se miltaa he
 It is from here that the conversation between the two starts and reaches from the store to Saira's bedroom
 lekin flert se shuru hui ye kahani pyaar main tabdeel hoti he
 But while partying one day, the two encounter businessman Zakir Merchant (jim Sarbh), who has a relationship with their previous birth
 kahani flashbek main jaati he or vahaan alag hi duniya aapke saamne aati he
 Raja, Rani battle everything happens and again the story comes back from Flashback to Present Day and whether shiva-saira's love story is executed or not
 ye jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Weak Links: The film has a good start but why are the serial events happening, why and when it is happening behind it
 is sawaal kaa jawaab aapako nahin mil paata he
 After the interval, when the story goes into flashback, there is a different kind of confusion in the story at that moment also
 khaastaur se us daur ke kirdaaron kii baatcheet karne kii style kaaphi kanphyus karti he jise bade dhyaan se sunanaa padataa he
 These characters could have been better decorated
 - film dekhte hue aapako lagata he ki mekar bananaa kuch or chaahate the lekin banate-banate kuch or hi ban gaya, jisaki vajah se screenple par kaam karne kii vishesh jarurat thi
 Many incidents occur publicly in Budapest

 The story reaches the island from the city
 tapu se samandar main kai ghatnaayen ghatati hai, ye sab kuch bahut hi kaalpanik lagata he or ikkisvin sadi main bahut hi banaavati bhi
 The music of Dinesh Vision's previous films like Cocktail, Hindi Medium was very good, but this time Rabta's music could not be a hit before release
 keval tital trek or 'ek vaari' hi har jagah sunne ko mila
 - The flashback in the film's story is disturbing, it would have been even more interesting if it was either based in today or in the period
 ab ye alam he kii mirzia, lav story 2050 vaali feeling is film se aati he
 One can see the onscreen look of Kriti in the film 'raabta' which was finalized in this way
 This film Sushant Singh Rajput has played the character of Present Day and Past very well and seeing how hard work will be put into this preparation
 vahin pichhali filmon se kaaphi behatar adaakaar kriti sinan karti hui dikhaai di hai
 Rajkummar Rao's look is amazing, but if he was shown talking in a more clear language, then that character would be even more interesting
 varun sharma kii maujuudagi unki har film jaisi hi he, kuch alag nahin he
 The presence of Jim Sarbh may not be liked by everyone but the effort is good
 vijual ke lihaaj se film kaaphi rich he or dekhne main alag feelings aati he
 Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanonbox Officefilm's budget is said to be about Rs 55 crores and does not want to keep 'raabta' from these things and it is being released in over 1500 screens in India and 330 screens abroad
 sushant singh rajput or kriti sinan jaisi star cast kii vajah se film ko bampar opening milane kii sambhaavna he
 The Securities and Exchange Board of India has imposed a penalty of Rs 5 lakh on the retail major Pantaloon for not settling the investor complaint within the stipulated time frame
 bazaar niamak ne apane aadesh main kaha he ki sabhi tathy or paristhitiyon ko dekhne ke baad hamane paaya ki pantalun ne sebi dwaara tay samaysima main shikaayat kaa niptaan karne main vilamb kiya
 Earlier, SEBI had identified the Kishore Biyani-promoted company as the company which has the highest number of investors' complaints pending
 july, 2010 main sebi ne company se kaha tha ki vah is shikaayat kaa niptaan kare or karrwai report 30 din main saunpe
 The order states that Pantaloons failed to do so

 england ke videshmantri david milliband ke bayaan par bharat ne kadaa virodh jataayaa he
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has written a letter to the Prime Minister of England on this matter, strongly objecting to Milliband's statement
 bharat ke daure par aae milband ne apane bayaan main aatankwaad ke masale ko kashmir se jodne kii koshish kii thi
 Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee also said that British Foreign Minister Miliband's statement about Kashmir need not be overstated
 'aae the haribhajan ko oton lage kapaas', england ke videsh mantri agar is dehati misare kaa matlab samajhate to shaayad wo nahin kehete jo wo kah gaye

 The Prime Minister has written to Brown that India hoped that the visit of Milliband would give strength to India's campaign against terrorism, but the statements of Milliband showed the opposite effect
 videsh mantri pranab mukherjee ke kaha he ki milliband ke masale par bharat ko jo kuch karnaa tha kar chukaa he
 The government also objected that Milband tried to impose its agenda on terrorism on India
 milliband ne kaha tha ki kashmir masale ke samaadhaan ke baad pakistan ko apane pashchimi seemaa par taliban auki alqaida ke khatre se nipatane main madad milegi jo ki aatankwaad kaa asli jad he
 But Milliband is a threat to the forgotten al-qaeda and the Taliban such as the United States and England
 Similarly, organizations like Lashkar and Jaish have nothing to do with India and these organizations have nothing to do with any issue
 haalanki ab england ne apane ucchayukta ke jariye safai pesh kii he ki milliband kaa iraadaa aatankwaad ko kisi masale se jodakar use jaij tehraane kii nahin thi
 But India has refused to take this issue lightly and the silence is being seen by the Indian government as a protest against this issue, with the UK Minister of State for Commerce Peter Mandelson meeting the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister

 It is also linked to another effort from Beijing — which is perhaps more important — to change the status quo: Bhutan's relationship with India
 beijing main bhutan ke saath rishte majboot karne kii maang badhati ja rahi he,kyonki uske saath china ke kootnithik sambandh nahin hai
 This has become evident in the weeks following the June 16 confrontation
 pashchim beijing ke ek thinkatank charhaar institute main25july ko doklam ke mudde par gahan vichaar-vimarsh ke liye jab pramukh samrik visheshgy jamaa hue to do darjan visheshgyon,jinamein bharat main kaam kar chuke purv rajanyik shaamil the,kaa ek hi mat tha ki nepal or srilanka kii tarah bhutan ke saath bhi rishte majboot karne kii sakht jarurat he

 The statement used the important word "sarvabhavam", as it is widely believed in Beijing that India has "entered" Doklam without Thimphu's call
 bayaan main aage yah bhi kaha gaya ki china or bhutan ke bich seemaa vivaad kaa bharat se kuch bhi lenaa-dena nahin he tathaa tisare paksh ke taur par bharat ko china or bhutan ke bich seemaa ke mudde par baatcheet main hastkshep karne yaa vighn daalane kaa koi adhikaar nahin he,saath hi bhutan kii ore se ilaake par daawa karne kaa to bilkul bhi adhikaar nahin he
 "china has always respected Bhutan's universality and independence," the statement said, pointing at India in sarcasm
 do deshon ke bich koi aupchaarik sambandh na hone ke baavjood ucch str kii baatcheet hone lagi he
 In June 2012, when the then Prime Minister Wen Jiabao met former Bhutanese Prime Minister Jigmi Thinley in Brazil, he had said that China was "ready to formally establish diplomatic relations with Bhutan based on the five principles of peaceful co-existence"
 "pichley saal is bayaan ko pehle se bhi zyada jor ke saath tab doharaaya gaya tha jab videsh mantri wang yi ne beijing main seemaa ke mudde par24wein chakra kii baatcheet ke samay bhutan ke videsh mantri dimcho dorji ko bataaya tha ki donon deshon ke bich''jaldi hi rajanyik sambandh sthapit karnaa na sirf donon deshon ke saajha hit main he balki kshetreey sthayitv or vikaas ke liye bhi phydemand he

 Kashmiri students are being charged at their educational institutions for depositing fees from Chardaderi
 Kashmiri students studying in Dehradun, the capital of Uttarakhand, have accused their educational institutions of being charged for late fees in their colleges
 saath hi yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki anuchhed 370 nirast hone ke baad chaatr jab waapas apane college main aae to un par kam upasthiti ke liye jurmaana bhi lagaaya gaya, jise bharne main chaatr sakasham nahin ho paa rahe, aise main unka pariksha main baithna mushkil ho jayega
 The same, the management of the colleges stated, 'late fee is a criterion which is always applicable and it is taken from everyone
 'dehradun ke kai collejon main padhane valekai kashmiri chaatro ne aarope lagaaya he ki unke collejon ne unase let fees vasuul kii or un par kam upasthiti ke liye jurmaana lagaaya, kyonki ve dhara 370 ke nirast hone ke baad ghati main band hone ke kaaran apane shaikshanik kaarykram main shaamil nahin ho paae the
 Students being charged from 5,000 to 12,000 said that they are being charged from Rs 5,000 to Rs 12,000
 chaatro ne kaha ki jab unhone apni chintaaon kaa hawala dete hue apane sansthaanon ke prashasan se sampark kiya tha, tab bhi unhen yaa to jurmaana adaa karne ko kaha gaya yaa jurmaana naa chukaane kii sthiti main paper se vanchit kiya jayega
 Jammu and Kashmir Students Association spokesman Nasir Khuhami claimed that there are more than 300 Kashmiri students in Dehradun, who are being asked by colleges to pay late fees and low attendance fines
 dehradun main adhikansh chaatr uttaranchal college, sai santhaan or maaya college se hai
 Appalnasir Khuhami of waiving the fine and conducting additional classes said that it was impossible for the students at that time to ensure that contact was broken in the valley and everything was halted for several weeks
 hamane college prashasan se jurmaana maaf karne or atirikt kakshaen sanchalit karne kii apil kii he, taaki sabhi vishyon ko cover kiya jaae, jisase ve kam se kam pareshaan hon
 Khumi said, the association has also urged the Uttarakhand government to solve their problems soon
 jab ek nijee college prabandhan se baat kii gai to wo apana pallaa jhaadte dikhe
 According to him, this is the rule and without depositing this amount, it is difficult to sit in the examination
 is raashi ko online jamaa karnaa hota he jo ki hemanti nandan vishvavidhyalay ke khate main jaataa he
 There is no role of colleges in this, as well as penalty amount has to be paid to all the students of the class, as this is the rule of the university and in the absence of fees, the admit card will not come, due to which the exam will be denied
 ek din pehle film maanjhi : da mountainman dekhi
 The hobby of watching selected films pulled me away from this out of the box movie
 dasharath maanjhi kii asal zindagi par bani film kai myanon main ek clasik film lagi
 The struggle of a man, his hard work, and the indomitable courage to break the mountain seems to be a thing of another era
 aaj ham log mobile phone, soshal media or jabardast bhaag daud kii jindagi main sabar or lagan kis chidiya kaa naam he bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 The struggle, misery and persistence of this real life story beyond imagination draws attention to our greatest strength

 Of course, Dashrath Manjhi spent his life, cutting stones, sweating blood and getting his own destination, but why do we make the least difficulty a mountain
 wo kehete hai na 
 
 
 
 
 Made a mountain of mustard
 yahaan to ek aadmi ne pahaad ko zamin par laa diya
 Suffering, fighting and being so drowned in them that even the wicked seem lovely

 This is a real story which would have been able to make only one thousandth part of the pain that Dasaratha Manjhi had endured and lived in her life of 22 years on the film screen
 2007 main real life ke dasharath maanjhi ke guzar jane ke 4 saal baad sarkaar ne unke sapane ko saakaar kiya
 We understand the importance of someone after leaving
 ye film hamaare samaaj kaa aainaa he
 The society that we cannot know by sitting in cities
 iske liye kethan mehta ke camere kii nazar kii daad deni hogi
 Manjhi has shown the importance of a man's stubbornness, ranging from untouchability to poverty, powerlessness and love
 dikhaaya he gurbat main rahane vaale bhi muhabbat kii misaal pesh kar sakate hai
 When Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal for his wife, Dashrath Manjhi made a road for his wife by ripping the chest of the mountain
 garibi main sansadhano kii kami ke bich upji, panpi or lahalhane vaali is muhabbat ke paravaan chadhane kii kahani ko kethan mehta ne badi khubsuurati se filmi parde par saakaar kiya he
 Finally, without Nawazuddin Siddiqui, this film cannot touch the heart

 Gandhi may be the son of Mother India, but cannot be given the position of Father of the Nation
 ' unhone kaha ki bharat devataaon kii bhoomi he
 How can one be the father of this great country within just 100 years
 'gandhi kii photo vaali noton se bhrashtachar'desh main badhate bhrashtachar ke liye gandhiji kii tasviir vaale noton ko jimmedaar bataate hue acharya ne kaha ki bharat kii karansi main mahatma gandhi ke bajaay bhagwaan ganesh kii tasviir chhaapi jaani chahie

 According to the news published in an English newspaper, India as well as France have proposed it in the United Nations
 darasal, sirf jaish-e-mohammad hi nahin bharat duniya ko ye batayega ki america dwaara bain harakat-ul-ansaar (hua) jaish kii hi parent body he

 a Delhi court said that the police officers willfully drop loopholes in the charge sheet, so that the courts are bound to release the accused involved in the serious crime and thus the judiciary is infamous

 In the midst of the uproar in the CBI, the Supreme Court has given a shock to the Central Government, that the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) will investigate the case against the now-removed CBI Director Alok Verma
 court ke faisle ke mutabik yah jaanch sivisi ko mahaj do hafte main puri kerani hogi or khud supreme court sivisi kii jaanch kii nigaraanee karata rahegaa
 While this decision of the court caused a major setback to the central government, the decision has had a direct impact on the functioning of the CBI
 sibiai main jari ghamaasan ke chalate supreme court ne kade rukh se sibiai ke dainik kaamkaaj main asar padegaa
 The most important thing is that Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi has stopped the interim directive Kankaneshwar Rao appointed by the Central Government to take any major or policy decision in the CBI
 court ke aadesh ke baad nageshwar raav mahaj routine kaam karenge
 Any kind of policy decision, opening or closing a case, transferring a senior officer, will remain outside their purview
 abhi tak jahaan sibiai apni jaanch main puri gopneeyata baratane kaa kaam karti rahi he or mahaj pradhanmantri ko sidhe taur par apane kaamkaaj kaa byora uplabdh karaati rahi he
 Now after the decision of the court all the decisions taken by the interim director have to be submitted to the Supreme Court in a closed envelope
 is faisle se sivisi kii jaanch kaa nateeja aane tak kendra sarkaar or sibiai ke bich supreme court kii ahm bhoomika rahegi
 The Supreme Court has appointed retired Supreme Court Judge AK Patnaik to oversee the CVC probe against CBI Director Alok Verma
 vahiin supreme court ne apane faisle main teenon kendra sarkaar, sibiai or sivisi ko notice jari karte hue kaha he ki vah apana-apana paksh court ke saamne rakhen
 Significantly, in his petition before the Supreme Court, Verma had argued that the Prime Minister, Chief Justice and Leader of Opposition are included in the committee appointing the CBI Director
 sibiai nideshak kii niyukti 2 varsh ke liye kii jaati he or kaarykaal ke dauraan bina is samiti kii anumati liye hataaya athwa tabadalaa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 At the same time, in his petition, Verma had also claimed that after he was wrongly removed from the post, the interim director has decided to reshuffle officers in many big cases under the CBI
 verma ne ashanka jaahir kii ki aise faislon se jaanch prabhavit ho sakati he

 kharbanda @nadiadwalagrandson @foxstarhindia post shared by Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) on May 20, 2019 at 12:24 am PDT Akshay Kumar (akshay Kumar), posting the picture, wrote, House Full of Thrones, Who won Who is and who dies, it is only the script that disides
 bataa den in dinon akshay kumaar 'housephul 4' (housefull 4) kii shooting main vyast hai
 'housefull 4' is the fourth part of the houseful series
 isse pehle housephul siries ke sabhi part box offis par superhit rahen hai
 'housefull' 4 will be directed by Farhad, it will be produced by Sajid Nadiadwala
 bataaya ja rahaa he housephul 4 is saal diwali ke maukey par 25 oktober ko relies hogi
 Fans are also eagerly waiting for this film
 diwali par relies sikret superstar ko logon kii prashansa kaa jamkar faaydaa miltaa dikh rahaa he
 Apart from the audience, the critics of the story of a modest city girl received immense love
 samikshakon ne to ise aam mumbaia masala film se alag bhi kaha
 There is no doubt that this is the best film of its time
 film ke massej or kalakaaron ke laajawab abhinay kii baat chhod den to isamen maujuud khamiyaan ise ausat film hi banaati hai
 Known for perfection and different passions, Aamir Khan's film has little scope to see it
 ek acchhee film kii kahani main khamiyaan or ausat clymex ise saadhaaran kahani bana detii he
 a 15-year-old girl from Baroda, Insia (zaira Wasim) is going to give board exams
 wo kamaal kii singer or gitarist he
 His dream is to become a superstar
 kahani jitani insiya kii he utani hi najma (meher vij) kii bhi jo ek aam gharelu mahila he
 Which is very much like watching TV especially music reality shows
 vah apane apartment main simati ek dari hui aurat he jo bacchon ke liye behad phikrmand he
 a woman who finds her prowess in a daughter, secretly against her husband and against her thinking
 insiya kaa sangharsh or najma kii paaramparik hadon se nikalne kii jaddojahad hi kahani kaa centre he
 Najma also has an engineer husband (raj Arjun)
 kahani ke mutabik vah utana hi krur or bhavashunya he jitna use hona chahie
 Budhi Apa, Insia's brother Guddu, Insia's boyfriend and flop musician Shakti Kumar are also there
 wo baaten jo sikret superstar ko aam kahani sabit karti hai # 1)clymex main aword seremani kaa seen bahut hi gairajaruri laga
 Don't know when Hindi movies will be free from crying and washing
 sikret super star main bhi yah bahut drametic ho gaya he
 It feels worse when Zaira Wasim, who is the best acting in the whole film, does not see the emotion on her face when she is doing it
 stage se utar kar bhaagate hue unka abhinay bahut nakli lagata he
 The film should have ended at the airport itself
 # 2) kahani nai he, behtareen dhang se filmai bhi gai he
 Quite fast too
 lekin kahani main jhol bhi he
 Because of this, they continue to be a great script
 jaise maa ke haathon computer pate hi insiya raaton-raat utyub par gane aplod karti he or ek hi din main wo hit bhi ho jaataa he
 Things go viral on the same day, but in the filming of this plot, Insiya's child mind's struggle is given very little time
 ausat se zyada lambii film main utyub par singing sansani banane kii ghatana ke bich insiya kii uhapoh ke liye thodaa or vakt diya janaa chahie tha
 But just like the common Mumbaia movies of the 90s (in some movies, the poverty-stricken hero of the house becomes a millionaire in the same scene
 yaa badla lene aparaadh kii duniya main aayaa hero ratorat shahar kaa bada gangster ban jaataa he
 ) Secret Superstar also could not be saved from him
 ye 'jaadui' teji akharati he
 Review: The director's film is Secret Superstar, interesting to see Aamir after Dangal # 3) Insia's escape from school to Mumbai and recording plot is almost the same
 yani 'jaadui' teji kaa shikaar
 If you are unable to sing Insia's song in Shakti Kumar's studio and leave the seas under the sun in the toilet, then here too, the Secret Superstar Mango Masala movie looks like
 chunki film main abhinay or sampadan itnaa asardaar he ki ise dekhte vakt in chizon ko sochane kaa vakt hi nahin miltaa
 But it is not like a riot where a lot of reality was taken care of in the story
 kahani ke ye do aise pillar hai jis par puri film khadi he
 There was a need for more closely here, this would have given Insia her own struggle and a larger canvas
 # 4) budhi aapa dwaara insiya ko uske paidaa hone kii jaankaree dena, kahani kii mul aatma ke vipareet tathy parosna he
 According to the story, Insia's engineer father is a Muslim orthodox man who is thinking of getting his daughter educated in Riyadh after a board exam
 aisa rudh purush kaise 10 maheene gaayab rahi apni patni ko waapas ghar aane detaa he? darasal, film kii kahani main budhi aapa insiya ko bataati hai ki jab vah pet main thi to uskaa pita najma kaa aborshan karana chahta tha
 But Najma runs away from the hospital and when she returns home after 10 months, she has Insia in her lap
 phir duusari beti na paidaa karne kii shart par insiya kaa pita use waapas aane detaa he
 Aamir said - When Zaira will be successful in pulling the audience, then she will get more fees than me
 This tip of the story was not right according to the character of a conservative man
 ise utana hi sensoles maan sakate hai jitna thri idiyat main rainchon kaa jugad se delivery karana tha
 The director of the film, Advait Chandan, who has also written the story himself, could have told it in a better way too
 isse kahani kii aatma par koi asar nahin padataa
 # 5) Aamir Khan, who made films for social concerts, has made a big mistake, inadvertently, in the film
 darasal, maa se laptop paane ke baad jis tarah insiya raat ke teen baje tak internet istemaal karti he or soshal cites par vakt bitaati he use dikhaaya janaa ek tarah se galat he
 When she is doing these things under the consent and supervision of her mother, a teenager's internet use plot should have been filmed in some other way
 ye seen kishor man ke bacchon par bura asar daalane vaale ban gaye hai
 As such, there is a problem in those families where children are spending time on the internet late at night
 # 6) insiya ko apni maa kaa puraa saport he to bina bataae skool banks kar akele ghar se bhaagna dikhaane kii jarurat nahin thi
 In the film, his father is shown out of the house for many work, in such a case, Shakti Kumar's man would pick-drop him from Baroda, then the story does not matter much
 isi dauraan maa ke talaak ko lekar loyr rina se insiya kii meeting filmai ja sakati thi
 but that did not happen
 film ke seen se kishor man ke drop out kii ashanka khaarij nahin kii ja sakati
 Aamir, who made a meaningful film like Taare Zameen Par, was not expected to do so

 Vasudev Devnani, Minister of State for Primary Education in the Vasundhara Raje government of Rajasthan, is a representative of the National self-service Association, which the Bharatiya Janata Party currently wants to support
 peshey se electrical ejeeniyar, 66 varshiya devnani aadhuniktaa, aavashyak sudhaar or shiksha main hindu samskruti ko samavisht karne ke bijepi ke agenda ke bich santulan saadh rahe hai
 He is also responsible for overseeing the work of making Ajmer a smart city with US assistance
 devnani teesri baar vidhayak bane hai
 Ironically, pressure from the anti-rss lobby in Ajmer's local politics led to a one-year delay in his induction into the cabinet and by ignoring his seniority to be given cabinet status, giving him only independent charge of primary education, Minister of State Was created ve isse pehle takneekee shiksha mantri ke rup main acha kaam kar chuke hai
 Being untouched by all the pressures, he took an oath in Sanskrit
 duusare vistaar main shaayad ve akele mantri the jinhone raaje ke charan nahin chhue
 But the Chief Minister approved his proposals including the saffron agenda
 devnani kaa kahana he, ''main behatar schuli shiksha ke liye mukhyamantri kii soch par amal kar rahaa hum
 Devnani first instructed schools to organize Vasant Panchami celebrations instead of celebrating Vasantotsav, a sacrifice associated with Veer Haqiqat Rai, who died while refusing to adopt Islam
 devnani ne us din skulon main bacchon se saraswati vandana kaa gayan bhi karavaaya
 He also ordered a review of the Rajasthan Secondary Education Board textbooks
 unka kahana he ki ye pustaken aise kaaryakartaaon ne likhin jo hindu virdohi or vamapanthiyon ke paksh main the
 Talking to India Today, he accused the previous Congress government of adopting an anti-hindu agenda and writing text books
 unka sawaal tha, ''akbar mahaan par paath kyon hona chahie? '' ve uski jagah maharana pratap kaa paath rakhwaayenge
 So is his thinking anti-muslim? "no, we will give Akbar a proper place in the text books
" '' sangh ne hameshaa kaha he ki maharana pratap ko aakrantha akbar se adhik sammaan milanaa chahie
 Devnani is also doing yoga, meditation and Surya Namaskar in schools daily
 ve in kadamon ko hindu hitkaari bataane vaali tamaam aalochanaon ko khaarij karte hue kehete hai, ''inhen duniya bhar main swasthya ke liye laabhakaari mana jaataa he
 Well, how can the sun which gives energy to everyone be considered just Hindus? He says he has only 4,500 physical education teachers for 40,000 schools
 unhen ab un chaar lakh shikshakon kaa sahaara he jo swechha se bacchon ko yah sab sikhayenge
 Devnani also wants an amendment to the Right to Education Act, because in the present form, a large number of children have moved out of government schools to private schools where the government pays for them
 unhone tees se kam bacchon vaale skulon kaa sabase najdiki bade skool main vilay kar puri vyavastha kii samiksha kii he or jaldbaaji main band kiye gaye 2,500 skool phir khole gaye hai
 The closure of these schools was severely criticized
 unka kahana he, ''ant main ho saktaa he ki ham sirf 8,000 skulon kaa hi behatar suvidhaon vaale skulon main vilay karen
 Here, his decision to keep private schools out of the free laptop and tablet scheme for unqualified students has been criticized for a few days now
 unka kahana he ki ve kuch nijee skulon or sibiesai board main sabase adhik ank laane vaale kuch vidhyaarthiyon ko isamen shaamil karne ko taiyaar hai
 Raje has approved his suggestion to name 186 new model schools in the name of Vivekananda and to provide wi-fi and computer facilities in Adarsh schools
 ve abhi ek network system par kaam kar rahe hai jiske jariye ve har skool main shikshakon or vidhyaarthiyon kii sankhya par najar rakh sakate hai
 His work is slowing down due to obstacles such as delays by the government in appointing members of the Board of Education, but the choice of simplicity has become one of the most talked about ministers

 ' There is a provision in three categories of loans under the flagship Mudra scheme of the Central Government
 pehali shrenee shishu main 50,000 rupee, duusari shrenee kishor main 50,000 se 5 lakh rupee tak or teesri shrenee tarun main 5 lakh se 10 lakh rupee tak karj dene kaa praavdhaan he
 According to the government data, 97 to 93 percent of the loans under this scheme have been given in the first category Shishu, 6 to 10 percent loan second category Kishore and 1 to 2 percent loan in the Tarun category at the top
 is yojana ke tahat die gaye karj kaa akalan nae rojgaar srijan karne ke shrot ke taur par dekhne par paaya gaya ki vitt varsh 2016-17 or 2017-18 ke dauraan teenon shreniyon main ausatan 23,083 rupee shishu, 2
 09 Lakh Kishore and 7
 67 lakh rupee kaa karj tarun shrenee main diya gaya
 The truth of the Mudra scheme: Even before the implementation, you used to get the benefit
 Now this loan given for business is not the earning but the capital of the business
 yah puunji kitni aay paidaa kar sakati he? maan liya jaae ki prayek shrenee main diya gaya karj 20 fisadi kaa ritern de rahaa he
 On this basis, the debt received in the Shishu category can give an income of Rs 4,617
 vahiin, kishor shrenee main diya gaya ausat karj 41,844 rupee kii aay or tarun shrenee kaa karj 1,53,445 rupee kii aay prati varsh dene main sakasham he
 Therefore, on this basis, the income in each category per month from Mudra loans is 384
