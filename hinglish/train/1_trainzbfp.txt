 But seeing the results of the MCD election, it seems that the people of Delhi did not forget Kejriwal's unfulfilled promises
 ek najar aise hi vaadon par jo ab tak hakeekat nahin bane hai
 No eradication of corruption: Aam Aadmi Party was born against corruption
 sarkaar main aane ke baad kejariwal ne logon se bhrasht adhikariyon kaa sting karke sarkaar ko bhejne ke liye kaha
 The promise to pass the Jan Lokpal bill was well done
 lekin janalokapal bill hakeekat kii shakl ikhtiyaar kar paaya or sarkaar kaa sting kaarykram bhi naakaam rahaa
 No one can claim that there is no bribery disease in Delhi offices

 The entry of journalists into his secretariat was also made difficult
 unke chuninda mantriyon ne bhi aisa koi sanket nahin diya ki wo satta ke mad se pare hai
 No concrete steps on women's security: After the Nirbhaya incident, women's safety in the country's capital was among the priorities of the Aam Aadmi Party
 lekin iske liye saarvajanik jagahon par 10-15 lakh sisitivi lagavane kaa vaada puraa nahin ho paaya
 Similarly, ten thousand women home guards have not been appointed yet
 na hi sarkaar ditisi bason main puri tarah mahila marshall tainaat kar pai he
 Not found Free In June 2016, 13 months after joining free wi-fi, Kejriwal government put forward a plan for free wi-fi network in the city
 is plan ke tahat purvi dilli main 3 hajaar hot spot point se free internet dene kaa blue print taiyaar hua
 In the rest of Delhi, the fiber network was described as lacking
 lekin dilliwaalon ke liye ab tak free vaai-faai internet ek sapana hi bana hua he
 The agenda of the Mohalla Clinic is unfinished, presenting the Mohalla Clinic as its most unique initiative
 desh or videsh kii media main isaki kaaphi charchaa hui bhi he
 But the reality is that the government has been able to open only 110 such clinics providing first aid, selective tests and free medicines
 inamen se bhi zyaadaatar kiraaye ke kamaron main chalaae ja rahe hai
 Whereas Kejriwal promised that by the end of 2016, 1 thousand such permanent clinics will be opened in the city
 safai karmchaariyon ko bhuule kejarivaldilli kii satta main aane ke baad kejariwal sarkaar kaa jhagada nagar nigam se chupa nahin he
 Due to lack of funds, Delhi garbage was piled up several times in the last year and a half
 lekin chunavi vaade ke mutabik, abhi tak sarkaar kii taraf se safai karmchaariyon ko medical beemaa, siver kii safai ke liye mask or karmchaaree kii maut par 50 lakh rupee muaavja dene kaa koi elaan nahin kiya he
 Failure on other issues Apart from this, the Kejriwal government has not yet kept the promise of running 3000 small buses to improve public transport

 is harakat ke liye unhen hameshaa ke liye bharat ko ripregent karne se bain kar dena chahie

 kyonki vah corporate world ke fevorett hai, bos ke fevorett hai, unke liye haarana or jeetna myne nahin rakhata

 Priyanka Factor likely to succeed in UP Rahul Gandhi was on the front in the last assembly elections and in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the election lost a lot, in the Lok Sabha elections, the party remained limited to amethi-rae Bareli
 aise main party agar is barupi main acha pradarshnanheen kar paati he to phir iskaa sidhaa asar 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main padegaa
 And this is the reason why Congress strategist Prashant Kishore as well as all the stalwarts Priyanka Gandhi are demanding to hand over the command of UP
 digvijay singh, kamalnath, gulam nabi aaazaad sareekhe congressi netaa ab party alaakaman se bade faisle kii maang kar rahe hai
 Congressmen see a wave of change under Priyanka's leadership
 vaise priyanka bhi amethi-raibareli kii jamini hakeekat se puri tarah se waakif hai
 For years, Priyanka has been seeking votes for the party in both these places
 priyanka kii maang upi congress ke netaaon main zyada ho rahi he
 Because the competition is tough and they find the opponent's upper hand heavy
 aise main unki ye aawaaj andar kii chatapataahat he, unhen lagata he ki priyanka gandhi ke maidan main utarane se mukaable main congress kii joardaar vaapasi hogi
 2
 priyanka main indira kii chhavi dekhte hai congressipriyanka gandhi jis andaaj main apni baton ko rakhti hai usase janata unase sidhe jud jaati he
 Also, in Priyanka Gandhi, Congressmen have a glimpse of their grandmother Indira Gandhi
 janata congress se kya chaahati he ye priyanka bhi khub jaanati hai
 Priyanka's style of attacking even laughing opponents is completely different
 virodhiyon ko bhi lagata he ki agar congress ne upi main priyanka ko daanv par lagaaya to phir mukaable main congress kii joardaar vaapasi ho jaaegi
 There is no doubt that the Congress will benefit from Priyanka's arrival
 priyanka ko kaman saunpane se gandhi parivaar kaa paramparaagat voters ek baar phir congress main lautne ke bare jarur vichaar karenge
 3
 upi kii siyaasi jameen priyanka ke liye makulauttar pradesh main philhal chaar badi partiyaan chunavi maidan main hai
 There is little chance of any coordination before the election
 aise main muqabla kaante kii hogi isamen koi do raay nahin he
 The big challenge for the Congress is that they somehow stop the BJP in UP
 kyonki bijepi ne abhi se apni puri takat upi chunaav kii taiyaariyon main jhonk di he, khud pradhanmantrinarendra modi or party adhyaksh amit shahmorcha sanbhale hue hai
 But if the Congress introduced Priyanka in the UP elections, then the BJP will be forced to change its strategy, because Priyanka Gandhi currently has such an image that the opponents must think once before the attack
 yahi nahin, agar upi main priyanka cord safal rahaa to puure desh main congress ke liye nai raah khul jaaegi
 Two losses from Priyanka's arrival at the party: 1
 rahul kii raajnneetik kariyar par sawalia nishaancongress main priyanka gandhi ke majboot hone se rahul gandhi ke mishan ko jhatka lagegaa
 Even though Priyanka's entry will be in the politics of UP, but its side effect will be in the whole country
 upi kii tarah duusare rajyon main bhi priyanka kii maang badhegi
 In such a big question, what will happen to Rahul Gandhi? The party is more homebound than the fact that if Priyanka's hold as a political heir of the Gandhi family is strengthened, then this will weaken Rahul Gandhi's grip in national politics
 isi baat ko lekar congress main mahamanthan jari he
 Every aspect is being carefully considered as to how to find a middle way, so that the party is also strengthened and the Gandhi family once again prevails in the country
 2
 Priyanka's political experience is completely active in politics for the last decade, now she has started to understand the work of the organization
 saath hi desh bhar ke congress netaaon ke saath chaatr sanghathanon se bhi sidhe sampark main hai
 In such a situation, the stakes may backfire due to Priyanka not being fully active in politics
 isliye kuch log chaahate hai ki priyanka kuch vakt party ke taur-tareekon ko jaanane main lagaaein
 At the same time, opponents are also in the opinion that if Rahul is sideline in Congress, then they will get an opportunity to attack the Congress, in the same way how Priyanka will answer this attack is a big question
 philhal sabakuch gandhi parivaar ke faislon par tikaa he
 At the same time, many strategists are churning on this, only after assessing all the losses and losses, the Congress will consider any major changes

 white house ne pakistan kaa naam liye bina ek baar phir use khari-khoti sunai he or kaha ki aatankwaad kaa samarthan karke koi desh, america kaa dost nahin ho saktaa
 Let us tell you that US President Donald Trump had stopped the security assistance to Pakistan last month
 white house ne jaankaree dete hue kaha ki america se sahaayta paane vaale desh aatankwaad ko samarthan dekar yaa use andekha karke america ke dost nahin ho sakate
 Such a message was awaited from the US for a long time
 aatank kaa samarthan karata he PAK, khud bhi hota he shikaar: americabta den ki trump prashasan ne pakistan par aarope lagaaya tha ki aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai main vah paryaapt kaam nahin kar rahaa he, iske saath hi pichley maheene use di jane vaali kareeb do arab dollar kii suraksha sahaayta par bhi roak laga di thi
 Citing Trump's recent decisions, the White House gave a detailed account of his foreign policy in a fact sheet, saying, "president Trump is making it clear to our allies that by supporting terror, or ignoring it, he will be a friend of America
" Can not be made
 ’mangalvaar ko trump ke pehle state of di union sambodhan ke baad white house ne fact shit main kaha, ‘raashtrapati ne pakistan ko suraksha sahaayta roak di or is tarah sahaayta paane waalon ko sandesh diya ki ham unase yah ummid karte hai ki vah aatankwaad se ladaai main puri tarah hamaare saath honge
 'when North Korea was given a 15-year-old student by North Korea, Kazakhstan has denied allegations of supporting terrorism
 white house ke mutabik trump america kii suraksha ko jo khatre hai, un par lagaataar dhyaan denge or kattarpanthi islamic aatank or isaki vichaardhaara se muqabla karne or use haraane ke prayaason ko praathamikta denge

 ---input IANS se Allegations of tampering of Electronic Voting Machines (evms) are being mooted by opposition parties
 isi mudde ko lekar sattarudh party par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa jaataa rahaa he
 At the same time, in the last few years, at least 9 countries have requested the Indian Election Commission for electronic voting machines
 ye khulaasa soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat ek yachika (RTI) se hua he
 During the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, large-scale political allegations about the misuse of evms came to light for the first time
 us chunaav main congress ke netritv vaale gathbandhan se shikast khaane vaali bijepi ne evms se chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Since that election, it has become a political routine in the country that whichever party loses in the elections has been questioning the credibility of evms
 chaahe wo 2014 ke aam chunaav hon, rajya vidhansabhaon ke chunaav hon, yahaan tak ki upachunaav hon, sab jagah ye dekhne ko miltaa rahaa he
 The neighboring country Nepal demanded supply of evms in 2012 after the 2009 election evms dispute
 2014 main nigeria or 2016 main indonesia ne bhartiya chunaav ayog se aisa hi aagrah kiya
 In 2017, four countries approached the Election Commission for evms
 ye desh hai- rus, bhutan, botaswana or papua new gini
 In 2018 Afghanistan and Namibia urged for the supply of evms
 in sabhi deshon ne evms ke kathith durupyog se jude vivaadon kii jagah uski vishwasaneeyata ko tarjeeh dena behatar samajha
 In response to the RTI received by the Election Commission, it has been said that India has supplied evms on three occasions to only two countries
 chunaav ayog ke jawaab main sandarbh kaa hawala nahin diya gaya he
 Namibia was supplied evms in 2012 and 2015
 isi tarah bhutan ko 2017 main bharat se evms milin
 In all other cases, the Election Commission either rejected the request for supply of evms / vvpats (voter verifiable paper audit trails) or postponed their supply
 sthagan kaa faisla bharat main chunaavon ke liye evms kii maujuuda jarurat ko dekhte hue liya gaya
 However, according to reports, countries like Nepal and Bhutan have been using Indian evms in some elections since 2009
 iskaa hawala 2017 main tatkaaleen mukhya chunaav ayukta naseem jaidi ne bhi diya tha
 He said that although evms were supplied to countries like Nepal, Bhutan and Namibia, countries such as Australia, Bulgaria, Nigeria and Russia also expressed interest in evms
 chunaav ayog ne bataaya he ki duusare deshon ko niryaat jane vaali evms main hardware vinyas or software code alag hota he
 Also, there are other types of combinations of colors, colors of cables, screen printed labels
 artiai jawaab main kaha gaya he ki kisi bhi desh ne bharat se vvpats vaali evms ko nahin kharida he
 In the RTI, the Election Commission was also asked what was the reaction of other countries regarding the use of evms and whether some countries even rejected them after use
 is sawaal ke jawaab main chunaav ayog ne yahi kaha ki aisi koi jaankaree uplabdh nahin he
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is going to West Bengal today between West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and bjp's talk
 siem yogi adityanath purulia main ek raily ko sambodhit karenge
 BJP has made a new plan in the event of not getting permission for landing of helicopter of CM Yogi in Bengal
 bijepi kii nai yojana ke tahat purulia main raily ko sambodhit karne ke liye siem yogi pehle vimaan se ranchi jaaenge, vahaan se helicopter se bokaro or phir sadak ke raste purulia pahunchenge
 Yogi's helicopter was not allowed to land in Balurghat last Sunday, after which he addressed the rally via telephone
 isi vajah se yogi ne is baar sadak ke raste pashchim bengal jane kaa faisalaa kiya he
 At the same time, his proposed rally in Bankura has been canceled due to lack of permission to land helicopters
 siem yogi adityanath kii aaj purulia main raily kareeb dopaher teen baje honi he
 The Mamta government of Bengal has not allowed her helicopter to land
 yahi vajah he ki ab unka helicopter jharkhand ke bokaro main land karegaa or vah yaheen se sadak maarg se purulia ke liye niklenge
 Explain that the distance from Bokaro to Purulia is about 50 to 55 kilometers
 pashchim bengal bhaajapa ne bankura main mangalvaar ko nirdhaarit uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii jansabha somvaar ko yah daawa karte hue radd kar di ki jila prashasan unke helicopter ko utarane ke liye anumati dene main taal-matol kar rahaa he
 State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said, 'we have decided to cancel today's Yogi Adityanath's Bankura rally as the district administration is deferring to allow his helicopter to land
 ham koi jokhim nahin lenaa chaahate hai, isliye hamane radd kar diya he
 'D Osh said Tuesday Adityanath of Purulia rally will be in accordance with the currently scheduled program

 Maharashtra has been ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena alliance for the last four years
 is dauraan soobe main 12,021 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii yani pichley chaar saal se rojaanaa 8 kisaan maut ko gale lagaate hai
 These figures of farmer suicides just before the assembly elections are going to trouble the government of Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena alliance
 aapako bataa den ki maharashtra main is saal ke aakhir tak vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Maharashtra is reeling under a severe drought and above all the suicides of farmers are extremely worrying
 raahat or punarvaas mantri subhash deshmukh ne vidhansabha main sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue bataaya ki janvari 2015 se disambar 2018 ke bich 12,021 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii, jinamein se sirf 6,888 kisaanon yani 57 fisadi kisaanon ke parijan hi aarthik sahaayta paane ke yogya paae gaye
 Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Subhash Deshmukh said that the state government has given financial assistance of one lakh rupees to the families of these deceased farmers
 unhone kaha ki ab tak 6845 kisaan aatmahatya ke maamalon main aarthik sahaayta banti ja chuki he
 In the year 2017, the state government came up with a loan waiver scheme to save farmers from stress
 deshmukh aage bataaya ki 2019 ke shuruaati teen maheenon main 610 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 Out of this, 192 farmers have been found eligible for assistance
 unhone kaha ki vipaksh fadanvis sarkaar ko kisaan aatmahatya ko mudda banaakar gherne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 The wrong policy of the government is being blamed for these suicides
 jayant patil ne is mudde par bolte hue kaha ki hamane hameshaa krishi sankat kii ore sarkaar kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya he
 Whether loan waiver or crop loan all needy things are not reaching the farmers
 is prakaar, unhen adhik se adhik vittiya sankat main dhakelnaa is tarah ke charam kadamon ke liye agrani kar rahaa he
 Senior cabinet minister Subhash Deshmukh said that the government was taking farmers' suicide seriously
 baavjood, agar kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai to yah sarkaar ke liye gambhir vishay he
 We have waived the debt of 24 thousand crores of farmers
 iske alaava chote kisaan aasaani se kheti ke liye karj le sakate hai
 The central government clarified the position on the ordinance providing penalty on demonetisation, saying that there is no provision for arrest in it
 niyam ke mutabik 31 march 2017 ke baad 500 or 1000 ke puraane note pakade jane par jurmaana adaa karnaa hoga
 In this too, you will be able to deposit the same with the Reserve Bank, who have strong evidence that they were abroad since November 8, 2017, so they could not deposit in time
 iske liye passport par vaid vija ke saath muhar bhi dikhaani hogi
 Apart from this, during the course of studies, those who keep old notes for the purpose of research will also be exempt, they can keep a maximum of 25 notes but they also have to give full proof of their research
 ab 31 march 2017 ke baad ek samay main 10 se zyaadanodrakhane par pabandi rahegi, phir chaahe ye note 500 ke hon yaa 1000 ke, yaa donon
 You can keep up to 25 notes for research
 note jamaa karte vakt galat jaankaree dene par 5,000 rupee jurmaana yaa jamaa rakam kaa 5 guna jurmaana dena padegaa
 Whereas, after March 31, 2017, if the note is kept more than the limit, a fine of 5 times the amount seized will be Rs 10,000
 yahi nahin, 30 disambar ke baad 500 or 1000 ke puraane note jamaa karne ke liye kathor sharton ko puraa karnaa hoga
 Before depositing old notes after December 30, it has to be told why it has not yet been deposited
 saath hi khud agar rigerv bank nahin pahunch sakate to dak ke jariye puraane note or saath main ghoshnaptr bhej sakate hai
 The manifesto has to explain why it did not come itself, and why it has not yet collected the notes
 rigerv bank aapaki daleelon se sahamat nahin hua to puraane note ko nakaar bhi saktaa he

 grahamantri amit shah ne rajyasabha main jammu-kashmir par charchaa kaa jawaab diya
 On Monday, the bill to extend the period of President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir to 6 months and the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Amendment Bill 2019 were introduced in Rajya Sabha
 isi ko lekar charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue grih mantri ne kaha, 'main narendra modi sarkaar kii taraf se sadan ke sabhi sadasyon tak ye baat rakhana chahta hum ki kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he or ise koi desh se alag nahin kar saktaa
 i want to reiterate that the Narendra Modi government has a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism
 unhone kaha ki jamhuriyat sirf parivaar waalon ke liye hi simit nahin rahani chahie
 We should go to the village of Jamhooriyat, forty thousand Panch, to Sarpanch and we did the work of carrying it
 jammu kashmir main 70 saal se kareeb 40 hajaar log ghar main baithe the jo panch-sarpanch chune jane kaa rasta dekh rahe the
 Why elections have not been held in Jammu and Kashmir till now, and then we talk about freezing
 modi sarkaar ne jamhuriyat ko gaanv-gaanv tak pahunchane kaa kaam kiya he
 Amit Shah said in question that the Sufi tradition was not a part of Kashmiriyat
 Kashmir was the bastion of Sufiyat in the whole country, where did that culture go? They were evicted from their homes
 unke dharmik sthanon ko tod diya gaya
 Sufi saints were killed selectively
 jo bharat ko todane kii baat karegaa usko usee bhashaa main jawaab milegaa or jo bharat ke saath rahanaa chaahate hai uske kalyaan ke liye ham chintaa karenge
 The people of Jammu and Kashmir need not be afraid
 'unhone kaha, 'kashmir kii awam kii samskruti kaa sangrakshan ham hi karenge
 a time will come when Kashmiri Pandits will also be seen worshiping in Mata Kshir Bhavani temple and Sufi saints will also be there
 main nirashaavadi nahin hum
 We talk about humanity
 main garv ke saath kah saktaa hum ki ayushmaan bharat yojana ke tahat ek saal ke andar kisi ek rajya main sabase zyada labhaarthi hai to wo jammu kashmir main hai
 In the Narendra Modi government, free treatment is being provided to the poor
 ye insaaniyat he
 "ghulam Nabi Saheb said that you make the elections happen
 ham congress nahin hai ki ham hi chunaav kara den
 In our rule, the Election Commission only conducts elections
 hamaare shashan main ham chunaav ayog ko nahin chalaate
 Ram Gopal ji said that if Kashmir is disputed, then i would like to tell that neither Kashmir is disputed, nor POK Kashmir is disputed, they are an integral part of India
 'main sadan ke madhyam se sabhi ko bataanaa chahta hum ki ham jammu kashmir main pidipi ke saath gathbandhan karen, ye hamaara nahin balki vahaan kii janata kaa faisla tha
 a fragmented mandate was then found
 magar jab hamen laga ki algaavvaad ko badhaava mil rahaa he or pani sir ke upar ja rahaa he to hamane sarkaar se hatane main tanik bhi der nahin kii
 The Congress should tell one thing that why did you ceasefire in 1949 when one third of Kashmir was under Pakistan's occupation
 ye sijafire na hua hota ye jhagada hi na hota, ye aatankwaad hi nahin hota, kareeb 35 hajaar jaane nahin gai hotin
 The root cause of all this was ceasefire
 'manoj jha ji or gulam nabi aaazaad ji ne badi aapatti jaahir kii ki ham nehru ji ke bare main desh kii janata main kuch galat vichaar khadaa karnaa chaahate hai
 This is not a good idea
 ham nehru ji ke bare main koi galat vichaar khadaa karnaa nahin chaahate he or na janata ko gumraah karnaa chaahate hai
 But there is one thing that the countries which do not learn from the mistakes of history do not have a good future
 itihas kii bhuulon kii charchaa honi chahie, or itihaas kii bhuulon se siikhnaa chahie
 'azad saheb said that movement in Jammu and Kashmir is stopped
 ye pehali baar nahin ho rahaa he
 Road movement is stopped when CRPF convoys go
 40 jawan maare jaaen or ham haath main haath rakhkar baith jaaen, ye nahin ho saktaa
 If you have to stop the traffic for safety, then you will stop
 jammu kashmir ke liye 80 hajaar karod rupee kii pradhanmantri narendra modi ji ne ghoshnaa ki thi
 63 parishes of 15 Ministries of the Government of India were given
 63 main se 16 pariyojnaayen puri ho chuki hai
 Out of 80 thousand crore rupees, 80 percent amount has reached there
 hamane algaavvaad or aatankwaad ko badhaava dene waalon par pratibandh rakhane kaa kaam kiya
 JKLF was not banned for so long, we worked to ban this organization
 jamaayate islamic, isko bhi raajnneetik sangrakshan praapt tha, us par bhi hamane pratibandh lagaaya
 Such questions have always arisen as to what lies in the greatest happiness for man
 In accumulating immense wealth, in gaining social dignity, in holding a high position, or being strongly connected to family and other relationships, many studies have shown that the most enjoyable feeling people get from better relationships

 vaise to har koi apane bachapan ke dinon ko hi acha bataata he, par zyaadaatar log maanate hai ki kareeb 33 saal kii avasthaa main unke behtareen din rahe
 Especially when they are able to connect to a love affair or a married life
 ek nae shodh ke mutabik logon kaa kahana he ki bachapan nahin, balki 33 saal kii umr main ve sabase zyada khush the
 The study is based on a survey conducted in the UK
 isamen 40 se zyada umr ke 10 main se saat logon ne kaha ki umr ke 33wein padaav par ve sabase zyada santusht or khush the
 More than half of the people (53 percent) said that life was more fun at that time, while 42 percent were optimistic about the future
 adtis pratishat logon ko jindagi tanavamukt lagati thi or 31 pratishat kaa maananaa tha ki us samay unka parivaar sabase zyada najadik tha
 According to the 'friends Reunit' survey, however, six percent said they were happiest while studying at the university, while only 16 percent took the name of childhood in response
 surveykshan main yah bhi paaya gaya ki parivaar, mitra or bacchon kaa saath milanaa sabase badi khushiyon main se ek hai
 One in five stated that happiness comes from success in work

 He said that a verbal war against Kohli can be done as Australia has done
 dakshin africa main gend se chhedchhad prakaran ke baad se australia ne maidan par thodaa naram rukh apanaaya he
 Cricket Australia was blamed for creating an atmosphere for winning at any cost which led to the controversial incident in Cape Town
 huge ko haalanki bhartiya captain kohli ke saath maamuli shabdic jang main kuch galat najar nahin aata
 The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Hughes as saying, 'you don't want to be stubborn, it's not a racist comment against him (kohli) or something like that but he can be seen staring or some tongue-in-mouth, it's Australia's way
 
 ’unhone kaha, ‘agar vah (kohli) duniya kaa sarvshereshth khilaadi nahin he to sheersh do yaa teen main shaamil he
 
 
 
 mujhe lagata he ki vah duniya kaa sarvshereshth khilaadi he
 There is pressure when one billion 200 million people in the world are supporting you and expecting you to perform well
 ’huge ne kaha ki agar dabaav main daalaa jaae to kohli ko kamjor kiya ja saktaa he
 Mistakes not to be repeated: Kohli will begin India's tour of India on Wednesday with the first match of the three-match T20 International series, followed by a series of four Tests and three odis
 match se pehle captain kohli ne kaha ki england main hamane moulik galtiyaan kin

 The relationship is new, old, between couples, there is a bickering over something
 lekin gusse main kai baar log kuch aisi bate bol dete hai, jisase unka rishta tuutane kii kagaar par pahunch jaataa he
 Therefore, it is very important to keep some things in mind while fighting with your partner on a small matter or a serious matter
 ye hai wo bate jo jhagadate samay partner ko nahin bolni chahie
 
 
 1
 'tum nahin samajhoge'gusse main ek duusare kii baat ko samajhane kii kshamta khatm ho jaati he
 On which some people sometimes tell their partner that you will not understand
 lekin jitna ho sake ye baat bolne se bachein
 Because the partner may feel that he is probably not capable of you
 isliye aapako samajhane main unhen chook ho rahi he
 When there is a rift in the relationship, make the partner feel like 2
 'hamen brallep kar lenaa chahie'har rishte main ek aisa samay aata he jab rishte main bandhe do logon main se kisi ek ko lagata he ki unhen ab is rishte se baahar nikal janaa chahie
 People become so unhappy with the relationship that when fighting a small thing, they tell their partner to breakup while fighting
 lekin baad main unhen apni baton par afsos hota he
 3
 'tum kisi kaam ke nahin ho'apane partner ko kabhi bhi ye naa bolen ki tum kisi kaam ke nahin ho
 This will make the partner feel that they have no respect in your life and you do not consider them worthy
 jisase aapke rishte kii samasyaayein kam hone ke bajaae badhati chali jaaengi
 4
 'tum se baat karne kaa koi matlab nahin he'jhagade ke dauraan partner se ye baat bolkar baatcheet band naa karen
 Because the solution to anything is found only when you calmly try to understand each other by discussing the reasons for the quarrel
 aise jaaniye, kya he shaadi karne kaa sahi samay!5
 'why don't you go back to your X' quarrel no matter how serious
 kabhi bhi ateet ke rishton ko bich main naa laaen
 Bringing the past into your quarrel can make the situation worse than before
 isliye jhagadate samay dherya se kaam len or kuch bhi aisa bolne se bachein jisapar baad main afsos karnaa pade

 India can rest some of their top cricketers in the fifth and final match against England in Leeds on Friday after taking an unassailable 3-0 lead in the fourth ODI by a nine-wicket win
 bhubaneshwar kumaar ne paanch test maichon main 172
 After taking 5 overs and taking 19 wickets, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said after the Birmingham victory that he was considering resting the medium pace bowler after a few Test matches
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘test siries ke bich main usne kuch adhik gendbaaji kar lee thi
 We made him bowl more than the new ball
 yadi ishanth (sharma) feet rahata to ham siries ke bich main ek match main bhuvi ko rest de sakate the
 But we couldn't really do it
 ’bhartiya think tanks haalanki ab behatar sthiti main he lekin vah uhapoh main bhi he kyonki leeds main kuch khilaadiyon ko rest dene se vijayi samanvay bighad saktaa he or isse world cap 2015 kii taiyaariyon par kuch asar pad saktaa he
 Therefore, it will be interesting to see if Dhoni and Co
 come out with their strong attack to make a clean sweep in the series or give some new faces a chance to play in England conditions
 kerala ke wicketiper ballebaaj sanju samson bhi apni baari kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 If some players are given rest, then leg-spinner Karn Sharma may also get a chance

 He is also in the queue to make it to the playing XI
 lekin dhoni aakhir tak apane pattey nahin kholane ke liye jane jate hai or leeds main toss hone tak koi kayaas hi laga saktaa he
 Team directors Ravi Shastri, coaches Duncan Fletcher and Dhoni have a day to plan their strategies for the fifth ODI and the only T20

 pakistan ise sanyukt raashtra ke niyamon kaa ulanghan maan rahaa he or duniya main isko lekar dhindhora peet rahaa he

 " himachal pradesh ke shimla sthit kotkhai main ruh kampa dene vaale gudiya gangrape-murder cese main dijipi somesh goyal ne kul 6 aropiyon kii giraftaar kii pushti kii he
 But the locals are not satisfied with the police's stated theory
 lihaaja vah cese kii sibiai jaanch kii maang kar rahe hai
 Speaking to the media, DGP Goyal said that the accused have been involved in the case from 19 years to 42 years
 dijipi ne bataaya, police ne sabhi aropiyon ko shimla ke kotkhai se giraftaar kar liya he
 The accused have been identified as Kotkhai resident Ashish Chauhan (29), Rajendra Singh alias Raju (32), Garhwal resident Subhash (42) and Deepak alias Deepu (38), Nepal resident Suraj (29) and Lokjan alias Chhotu (19) has gone
 dijipi ne bataaya ki police ke paas aropiyon ke khilaaf pukhta saboot hai
 The accused have also confessed their crime
 sabhi aropiyon se gunaah kii baarikiyon se judi paraten kholane ke liye poochtacha jari he
 The SIT has resolved the case in a much better way
 media se baatcheet ke dauraan unke saath esaiti chif jahur jaidi bhi maujuud the
 What was the case on July 4, accused Rajendra alias Raju and was going somewhere with a spraying machine along with his friends Ashish and Subhash
 is dauraan usne 10veen main padhane vaali chaatra gudiya ko dekha or gaadi rokkar use ghar tak lift dene kii baat kahi
 Gudiya came new in the area and she attended school last May
 gudiya raju ko jaanati thi, lihaaja vah uske saath gaadi main baith gai
 In fact, Raju often took school children, so that Gudiya did not even suspect him
 sharaab ke nashe main kii haivaanitpulice kii maane to raju or uske dost sharaab ke nashe main dhut the
 During this time, his intentions changed and he stopped the car, making excuses to unload the goods in the middle forest
 jiske baad unhone maasoom ke saath gangrape kiya
 The accused also called three of their companions there and then brutally murdered the doll and threw her corpse into the jungles
 gangrape ke dauraan darindon ne maasoom gudiya ke saath haivaaniyat kii intehaa barti thi
 During the gang rape, he threw the doll on the thorn bushes during the gang-rape
 gudiya kii peeth par kaanton ke kai nishaan mili hai
 Three marks have been found on the doll's body with teeth
 sabhi aropiyon ne maasoom ke saath baari-baari se rape kiya tha
 During this, he kept the doll's mouth pressed, which caused her death
 ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki aropiyon ne gudiya kii maut ke baad bhi uski laash ke saath rape kiya
 After that, they fled by throwing him there in a naked condition
 esaiti ne suljhaayaa blind murder kesaek aaropee jo is ghatana ke bare main jaanata to tha lekin isamen shaamil nahin tha
 Through him, the SIT investigating the case could reach all the accused in this blind case
 maasoom gudiya se hue gangrape or hatya maamle main bhale hi police ne 6 aropiyon ko pakad liye, magar kuch sawaalon kaa jawaab ab bhi police ke paas nahin he
 Like: 1- When the doll was killed on July 4, how did her corpse survive in this dreaded wild-beast area till July 6? 2- If the corpse was lying there for two days, then its arms and legs were full How was the body saved cleanly? 3- If the body had clothes on it, then how was it safe even when it rained? Rain or storm had no effect on them
 kapade kharaab tak nahin hue
 4- Why did the doll's hands and body not get mud due to the spanking during gang rape? Why did the police not get any trace from the opportunity? Earlier the police themselves were also talking about gangrape in the house or car
 5- aamtaur par itani badi vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad aaropee bhaag jate hai, lekin is cese main aaropee kahin nahin bhaage
 6- The distance from the residence of the two Nepali youths who were caught is about 200 meters
 yah sawaal uthta he ki agar unhone is vaardaat ko anjaam diya hota to vah apane ghar ke paas hi shav kyon phenkate?baharhaal in sabhi sawaalon kii vajah se police par sawalia nishaan uth rahe hai
 On social media, people are demanding that the CBI be investigated and hanged for the real culprits of the doll
 saath hi soshal media ke jariye hi logon ne gudiya ko insaaf dilaane ke liye ek campan chalaaya hua he
 This incident has created panic all over Himachal Pradesh
 kya bachche or kya bade, har koi gudiya ke liye insaaf maangane sadakon par utraa hua he

 The COA appointed by the Supreme Court said that there is no conflict of interest in the committee

 But now there are reports that this decision has not been taken on the basis of consensus
 sioe kii baithak ke bare main jaankaree rakhane vaale sutron ne ieenes se baatcheet main kaha ki vinod raay or leftinent general ravi thoj kii raay ek nahin thi
 But it is believed that there was no case of conflict of interest against the members, while Diana Edulji wanted Lokpal DK Jain to take a decision in this regard
 sutron ne kaha, 'raay or thoj is cheez ko lekar ekamat the ki teen sadasyeey samiti dwaara di gai ghoshnaaen kaaphi acchhee thim
 But Diana felt that it would be appropriate to take a decision on this by the Ombudsman, so that the conflict of interest case is not ignored and no case comes up later
 'raay ne kaha, 'hamane ise dekh liya he or yah thik he
 The candidates for the coach position will be trimmed in mid-august and then the coach will be selected after that
 is maamle main siesi kaa faisla antim hoga
 It is noteworthy that the COA had constituted a Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) under the chairmanship of Kapil in its last meeting to elect a new coach of the Indian team

 In a press conference on June 12, Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satyapal Malik had said that the idea is not new to the growing apprehension in the Valley on Article 370 and 35A guaranteeing special laws and safeguards for the state
 
 kashmiriyon ko ''chintaa karne kii koi baat nahin
 "he also cited similar provisions applicable in the states of Himachal Pradesh and Northeast in an interview in October
 malik us intervyuu main ''bhartiya nyaaypalika main vishwaas'' ke aadhaar par ishaaron main iske liye 'guarantee' dene kii baat tak kah gaye the
 Apparently, his reference was to petitions filed in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of 35A
 rajyapal ke aashwaasan ke baavjood, saat maheene baad, samvidhan se sangrakshit adhikaron ke nirastikaran kaa dar jammu-kashmir kii phijaaon main chaaya hua he
 Home Ministry's intention of BJP chief Amit Shah to join the government as the country's home minister and set up a commission for delimitation of state constituencies (to give numerical advantage to the bjp-backed Jammu region in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly) ) Has increased the expectations of Kashmiris
 yah jammu-kashmir kii vishesh sthiti ko samaapt karne ke bhaajapa ke puraane lakshya kii ore badaae main nirnaayak bhoomika adaa kar saktaa he
 It is being said that by removing Articles 370 and 35A, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah can push the Central Government into the flood of litigation and its basis will be 'similar provision' in other states also, which Malik has said
 yah sahi he ki jammu-kashmir ekmaatr rajya nahin he jiske liye samvidhan main vishesh kanoon or suraksha upaay shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Apart from Himachal, there are 11 states which are protected under Articles 371, 371A to 371J
 aise rajyon main maharashtra, gujarat, goa, assam, arunachal pradesh, nagaland, mizoram, manipur, andhra pradesh, telugana or karnataka shaamil hai
 But these are essentially constitutional provisions that protect the land, property, culture, languages, social practices and customary law of the tribals / tribes
 himachal pradesh kiraayedaari or bhoomi sudhaar adhinium 1972 (vishesh rup se dhara 118), jise ki aamtaur par, haalanki bhraamak rup se, (jaisaa ki rajyapal malik ne aktubar 2018 main kiya), anuchhed 35 e ke samanaantar bataaya jaataa he, vastav main yah ek rajya kanoon he jo us vyakti ke paksh main (krishi) bhoomi ke hastantaran ko pratibandhit karata he jo rajya kaa mul nivasee nahin he
 As stated from time to time, it is possible for a technically non-himachali person to purchase land, including farmland, after obtaining permission from the state government
 iske alaava, baahar ke kisi vyakti par flaton, gharon or vanijyik parisaron ko kharidne par koi roak nahin he
 Himachal also has an domicile law that allows those who have completed minimum 20 years of residency in the state to enter state government institutions and government jobs
 sikkim vastav main ekmaatr anya rajya he jahaan uske 1975 main bharat main pravesh karne se pehle ke kanoon maujuud hai
 Article 371F (k) states that all laws before Sikkim become a part of the Indian Union shall remain in force until the State Assembly repeals or amends them
 isamen aktubar 1962 kaa maharaja regulation bhi shaamil he, jo bahari logon ko sampatti kii bikri yaa hastantaran ko pratibandhit karata he
 The constitutional provision was incorporated in part to protect the rights of the largely tribal population of Sikkim
 anuchhed 370 or 371 donon 26 janvari, 1950 ko lagu hue samvidhan ke mul masaude kaa hissaa the
 State-specific other provisions were incorporated through amendments under Article 368, which grants Parliament the right to constitutional amendments
 haalanki anuchhed 35e ko sthaayee nivaasiyon ko paribhaashit karne or unhen sampatti arjeet karne, chunaavon main matdaan karne or sarkari naukari praapt karne ke adhikaar pradaan karne ke liye 1954 main raashtrapati ke ek aadesh ke madhyam se shaamil kiya gaya tha
 This provision was not approved by the Parliament and it has been challenged in the Supreme Court on this basis
 jammu-kashmir lok seva ayog ke saath lambey samay tak kaam kar chuke ek purv naukarshah ke
 B
 jandiyaal kehete hai, ''raashtrapati ko anuchhed 35e jaise nae praavdhaan jodgaye ke adhikaar praapt nahin hai jaisaa ki anuchhed 35 e ke maamle main hua
 "so, now the important question before the court is whether the President has the right to ignore Parliament and add a new article to the Constitution?" However, Article 370 (1) (d) seems to confer such power to the President, right with the consent of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir
 jo bhi ho, logon ne to apana-apana faisla dena shuru kar diya he
 J&K is not the only state which is equipped with security measures through special laws
 maharashtra, gujarat, goa, assam, arunachal pradesh, nagaland, mizoram, manipur, andhra pradesh, telugana or karnataka jaise 11 rajya bhi anuchhed 371, 371e se 371je ke tahat sangrakshit hai
 But these are mostly constitutional provisions that protect the land, property, culture, languages, social practices and their traditional laws of tribals / tribes

 As the Prime Minister approaches the end of the fourth year of his tenure, Narendra Modi will be both distressed and desperate to see the fate of his efforts to deal with Pakistan
 pakistan ko kaabo main karne ke liye unhone jo kuch bhi uski taraf phenkaa, usase vah koi sabak sikhta dikhaai nahin diya or zyada kadi sajaa ke liye lautakar aata rahaa
 Hardly ever before this tension and enmity has been seen on the Line of Control (loc), where the forces of Hindustan and Pakistan have stood face to face with each other since 2003, when the cease-fire The agreement was reached
 yah samjhauta bhi ab mritpraaya jaan padataa he
 Last year on the Line of Control, an average of three ceasefire violations occurred on a single day, even in winter, when thick sheets of snow have traditionally reduced cross-border infiltration
 nae saal main bhi isamen jaraa kami nahin ai
 Tensions escalated last week when the terrorists attacked the Sunjwan Army Camp in Jammu and the attack killed three military personnel and a civilian, besides three terrorists who carried out the mission
 takreeban iske saath hisrinagaramen siarpief ke camp par ek or aatanki hamalaa haalanki naakaam kar diya gaya, par isamen bhi ek jawan ko apni jaan ganvaani padi
 It was clear that India's patience was paying off
 jammu main ek press conference main udhaas-si dikhaai de raheen raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne pakistan par sunjuvaan hamale kii sajeesh kaa aarope lagaaya or aagaah kiya, ''pakistan apni is himakat kii keemat chukaayegaa
 "the big question is, to what extent can India go so that it can force Pakistan to pay the price of this type of" snowflakes "? Does New Delhi have a gameplan to counter the maneuver of Islamabad? Is there a final and decisive bet? There are no simple answers to these questions
 pakistan jab bharat ke saath tanatani kaa yah khel khilne ke liye baithta he, tab vah maanata he ki uske haath main kuch aalaa darje ke pattey hai
 One of them is its influence and influence in Kashmir and its ability to keep the valley in constant turmoil through its consequences like the Hurriyat
 uskaa doosraa ikkaa lashkar-e-taiyaba or jaish-e-mohammad sareekhe jehadi dhade hai jinhen apni manmarjee seemaa paar aatanki hamale karwaane ke liye iesai paalati-posti he
 Third, Islamabad's efforts to strengthen its evergreen friendship relationship with China and its readiness to act like an ambassador for Beijing's ambition to become a superpower
 chauthaa, afghanistan ke jhamele se baahar nikalne kaa rasta khojane kii apni justaju main america ke liye pakistan kaa nisbatan ahm hona he
 The fifth is the almighty army of Pakistan, the real boss, and is always ready to disarm its nuclear counterparts to warn India against the growing hostility
 or chatha ikkaa duniya ke sabase bade muslim mulkon main shumaar hone—or unamem bhi parmaanu bam se las akelaa mulk hone—kaa pakistan kaa rob-daab he
 So does the Modi government have a trump that surpasses these equations working behind the barbs of Pakistan and can beat them? Modi has a deep sense that maintaining relations with Pakistan is the most important priority of any Indian Prime Minister's foreign policy
 jawaharlal nehru se lekar ab tak harek bhartiya pradhanmantri yah ummid karata aayaa he ki vah pakistan ko bharat ke saath shantipurna sah-astitv kii baat samajhane main kaamyaab ho sakegaa
 Being the first Prime Minister of BJP with a clear majority in Parliament, Modi has not been less enthusiastic in his efforts to establish an effective relationship with Pakistan
 yah bhi tab, jab unhone pakistan kii takat ko sahaara dene vaale stambhon ko kamjor karne kii baqayada koshishen kii hai, jinamein unhen abhi tak kam hi kamyaabi mili he
 He has to give credit to the fact that he started playing on the strength of India's strong sides as soon as he took command
 inamen duniya kaa sabase bada kargar loktantr or vishwa kii sabase tej badhati arthvyavastha hone ke saath-saath rashtron kii aalaa mej par bharat kii surakshit haisiyat kaa hona bhi shaamil tha
 It was important and important for Modi to present India as a country which is always ready to extend a hand of friendship towards Pakistan, while also raising a finger towards its neighboring country and against big superpower countries against it
 Also urge to take steps
 pakistan ke prati apane aakraamak ravaie ke baavjood modi ne apane shapath grahan samaaroh main saarc ke duusare netaaon ke saath pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif ko bhi bulaakar duniya ko hairaan kar diya tha
 Soon thereafter, Modi began to change the rules of the relationship when he canceled the secretary-level talks when Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit tried to set an agenda by involving Hurriyat
 sandesh saaf tha, main baatcheet kii prakriya dobaaraa shuru karne ke liye taiyaar hum, par baatcheet kii mej par hitdharakon ke tisare paksh kii koi jagah nahin hogi—yaa to sarkaar se sarkaar ke bich baatcheet hogi, yaa koi baatcheet nahin hogi
 Then, in order to strengthen the government's hold on Jammu and Kashmir, Modi formed a BJP alliance with the PDP after the split decision in the April 2015 assembly elections
 is bich unhone hindustan ko or khud ko aisi takat kii shakl main pesh karte hue, jise gambhirtha se lenaa hoga, or america or china sahit tamaam bade deshon ke saath mubtila hote hue vaishvik manchon par dhaava bol diya
 Equally important, Modi also began to build closer ties with Muslim countries that Pakistan counted among his friends — Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Oman
 or pakistan ke ain pichhawaade main unhone afghanistan or madhya asian deshon ke saath bharat ke rishton ko majboot kiya
 The effort behind all this was to undermine Pakistan's ability to play Muslim cards for its own benefit
 modi ne 2015 main pakistan ko baatcheet kii mej par laane ke liye kai gambhir koshishen kin
 He took the then foreign secretary S
W
 jaishankar ko pakistan ke videsh sachiv se baat karne ke liye islamabad bheja
 Then he had a very cordial conversation with Sharif in the Russian city of Ufa
 donon netaa is par raji hue ki unke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaaron ko milanaa chahie
 But that attempt also received a setback
 seemaa paar se aae aatankwaadiyon ne gurdaspur main ek bas par hamalaa bolaa or ek thane ko nishaanaa banaaya, jisamen saat log maare gaye
 After that, talks between the National Security Advisers in Delhi were stopped because Pakistan was stymied over talks with Hurriyat leaders of its National Security Advisor
 haalanki modi ke rishte sharif se bane rahe or donon netaa jab paris main jalwaayu parivartan sammelan ke dauraan mili to unke bich rajamandi hui ki unke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar nishpaksh desh thailand main milen
 Modi went a step ahead and suddenly reached Lahore at Sharif's granddaughter's wedding on Christmas Day
 is tarah apane shapath grahan samaaroh main sharif ke pahunchane kaa maano badla chukaa diya
 But soon elements in Pakistan did not want peace with India
 modi ke lahore daure ke bamushkil hafte bhar baad 2 janvari, 2016 ko jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankwaadiyon ne pathankot hawaii thikaane par hamalaa bol diya
 After that the india-pakistan relationship reached a trough
 is bich pidipi-bhaajapa gathjod main tanaav ubharne lage or pakistan ne ghati main baari ashaanti failaane kii apni koshishen tej kar deen
 After the death of Burhan Wani in July, the worst environment in the valley was created and the security forces had to work hard to maintain law and order
 isamen pakistan kaa haath to jagajaahir tha
 Then Modi took a tough stand
 swatantraaa diwas ke bhaashan main unhone pakistan ke samvedansheel gilgit-blatistan or baluchistan ke ''logon kii aazaadee kii chikhon" kii charchaa kii
 Its clear purpose was to send a message to Pakistan that the affairs of Pakistan can also be redeemed
 pakistan se aae aatankwaadiyon ne sitambar 2016 main udi main doosraa bada hamalaa kiya to sena bhauchak rah gai
 Within ten days of that attack, Modi ordered a surgical strike across terror camps across the loc
 pakistan ko sandesh tha ki ham yah khel tumse behatar khel sakate hai
 Encouraged by China's support, Pakistan increased heat on the loc to prove that the surgical strike had not dampened its spirits
 lekin pakistan ko chaunkaate hue bhartiya sena ne apni karrwai tej kar di or javaabi karravaayiyon kaa daur bad gaya
 Security forces in Kashmir gained some edge by targeting key militants and preventing infiltration from across the border (see accompanying report)
 is bich america raashtrapati donald trump ne pakistan se do-took kaha ki vah apane tareekon se baj aae
 Islamabad did not know what to answer
 pakistani fouj par afgaan seemaa par riyaayat dene kaa america se dabaav pad rahaa tha
 He also had to appease the Kashmiri jihadi groups on the loc to calm his internal turmoil
 phir pakistan ko yah bhi ummid he ki bharat se tanaav badhane par shaayad trump kashmir ke maamle main dakhal dene kii sochen
 So, what will be the case after this bloodshed? Experts believe that the Kashmir issue will remain unresolved, that is, it is not going to end with any action
 purv rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar shivashankar menon kaa maananaa he ki pakistan ke maamle main koi dderghaavadhik sthaayee hal he hi nahin, sawaal sirf yah he ki ''aap aise hi halaat main rishton ko kaise durust banaae rakh sakate hai
 "others are of the opinion that there is no longer a bilateral issue as there is a lot of confusion between India and Pakistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and America and Pakistan in this matter
 aage kya ho? july 2017 main sharif ke gaddi chhodane par majaboor hone ke baad siyaasi asthirataa kaa daur in garmiyon main tay aam chunaavon main hi khatm hoga
 Pakistani military rulers are apparently unhappy with the Sharif brothers and may prefer a weak government led by Imran Khan, which can be fingered
 bharat ke liye chunaav khatm hone tak koi aise kad kaa netaa nahin he, jisase aman bahaali ke liye baat kii ja sake
 As Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Sarat Sabharwal says, "this is a bad time for India to take any major initiative
" "kuch halkon main ''ek khatarnaak pal" kii bhi charchaa he
 That is, if the Modi government feels that its chances of winning the re-election are getting bleak, then it can also wage a small war for political gains
 lekin modi itane to samajhadaar hai hi ki mahaj ek chunaav jeetne ke liye aisa jokhim nahin uthaanaa chahie, jo haath se phisal bhi saktaa he
 Pakistan has a large ace called Kashmir and India is also giving it a chance by using force to suppress the unrest there
 yah bharat ko sochna hoga
 It has the option of strengthening intelligence, restoring peace in Kashmir and thinking of easing relations with Pakistan
 adhure kadampradhanmantri narendra modi kii ore se kai baar dostana ravaiya dikhaane ke baavjood pakistan ne iske badale main seemaa paar hinsa hi di he

 deepika kaa kahana he ki unke liye unke kaam kii prashansa sabase zyada mahatvapurn he
 Deepika told in a collective interview, appreciation is important
 ham kaam kis liye karte hai? agar ham apni film ke liye mehnat karte hai or isaki prashansa na ho, to iskaa kya arth
 He said, money is less important and success is also not very important
 hamen jo pyaar or prashansa milti he vah mahatvapurn or moolyawaan he
 Deepika does not choose films keeping in mind the success
 unhone kaha, main is aadhaar par filmon kaa chunaav nahin karti ki yah 100 karod rupee kii kamai karegi yaa 200 karod rupee kii
 If this is the case, we are doing films for the wrong reasons
 unhone kaha, mere liye, film banane main box offis mahatvapurn nahin he
 You have to choose films from your heart
 unhone kaha, film patakatha ke liye kii jaani chahie
 The fate of the film is a different matter, but i should enjoy the process
 deepika kii agali film 'happy new year' 24 oktober ko diwali ke maukey par cinemagharon main utar rahi he
 Deepika told that before her election in the film, Farah was looking for a new girl for her multistarrer film
 deepika ne bataaya, shuruyaat main ve nai ladki chaahate the
 After 'chennai Express' i got a call from Farah and she said that she wants to make me a heroine in her film
 unhone bataaya, farah or shahrukh ne mujhe acchhee shuruyaat di thi
 They had introduced me very well
 unhone kaha ki ve un donon kii shukraguzaar rahengi

 On this, Nawazuddin says, "there were about 2,500-3,000 people who came to see the film and the film was also highly praised
 'kans se hindi cinema ko hone vaale phaayde ke bare main navazuddin kehete hai, 'log hamaari filmon ko jaanane lage hai or ek bada market hamen mil rahaa he
 When asked how many films he will knock with next year, he laughs and says, "I can't say this, if i get a chance to come to Cannes next time, i will definitely make special preparations for my clothes

 According to sources, this senior most legal officer of the government says that if the motion for impeachment is not taken in the Lok Sabha, then the efforts of two years to remove Sen will be 'futile'

 input :IANS After the only test match was washed out on Bangladesh tour, it is now a one-day battle and Team India ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has reached Bangladesh with his ODI army and has also started practicing
 vaise test formet se sanyas lene ke baad ab dhoni ke vanade or tii20 formet ke pradarshan par sabaki nazren hai or is siries main captaini ke saath-saath captain dhoni ko apane khud ke pradarshan kii chintaa jarur hogi
 Dhoni's bat has been quiet for quite some time now and it has also affected his status as the world's best finisher
 bataur captain to vah hameshaa shandaar rahe hai, lekin pichley ek saal main bataur ballebaaz unka pradarshan kuch khaas nahin rahaa

 Average 41
 18 kaa he, lekin is dauraan vah apane puraane rang main nazar nahin aae
 His form further deteriorated in the IPL and he was able to score only 372 runs in 17 matches at an average of 31 and only one half-century during this period
 -bangladesh ke khilaaf siries aasaan nahin hone vaali ye sab jaanate hai
 Especially if we look at the performance of Bangla Tigers for the last one year, this challenge seems tough, but many ODI team soldiers including captain Dhoni have reached Bangladesh and are engaged in practice
 nayaa daura he isliye captain nahin chaahate ki puraani galatiyon ko doharaaya jaae
 Dhoni is no longer a part of the Test team
 is formet ke liye apni ballebaazi main kiye badlaav kii ab unhen jarurat nahin he
 Before going on tour to Bangladesh, Dhoni practiced fiercely with his old coach in Delhi to bring back his old style and if Dhoni comes back to his old rhythm again in Bangladesh, then it will not be a matter of anyone to stop him
 
 pichley kuch samay se dhoni kaa balla kaaphi shant rahaa he or duniya ke best finishr ke unke rutabe par iskaa asar bhi hua he
 He has always been brilliant as a captain, but his performance as a batsman in the last one year has been nothing special

 khaskar agar bangla tigers kaa pichley ek saal kaa pradarshan dekhen to ye chunauti kathin nazar aati he, lekin captain dhoni samet kai vanade team ke sipaahi bangladesh pahunch gaye hai or abhyaas main jute gaye hai
 There is a new tour so the captain does not want the old mistakes to be repeated
 dhoni ab test team kaa hissaa nahin hai
 He no longer needs to change his batting for this format
 bangladesh daure par jane se pehle dhoni ne apane puraane andaaz ko waapas laane ke liye dilli main apane puraane coach ke saath jamkar abhyaas kiya or agar dhoni bangladesh main phir se apni puraani lay main aae to fir unhen roak paanaa kisi ke bas kii baat nahin hogi

 But the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an organization associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has opposed the Modi government's proposal to take foreign loans and termed it against the national interest
 desh ko 5 trillian dollar iconomi banane ke liye agle paanch saal main buniyadi dhaanche main 100 lakh karod rupee ke nivesh kaa mahatvakankshi lakshya rakhaa gaya he
 In the budget, the Finance Minister has talked about raising money from abroad through debt and other means
 sarkaar ne sanket diya he ki is vitt varsh kii duusari chamahi main iske liye pehla sovrain bond jari kiya jayega
 Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) says that taking loans from abroad is against the interest of the country and this can pose a long-term risk to the economy
 isse dhani desh or unki sansthaaen hamaare desh kii nitiyon kaa nirdhaaran main dakhal de sakati hai
 SJM co-convenor Ashwani Mahajan said that his organization will oppose it and for this a meeting of influential economists of the country will be organized
 mahajan ne news agency royatres se kaha, 'ham ise nahin hone denge
 We are confident that the government will withdraw its decision to bring these bonds

 unhone bataaya ki marchet banker kii niyukti samet bond kii maatra, samay or sankhya ke saath bazaar ke sambandh main faisla agle maheene liya ja saktaa he
 What happens Sovereign bondbonds are a means of providing assured returns through which companies or governments raise debt
 jo bond kharidta he vah ek tarah se sarkaar yaa company ko karj de rahaa hota he or use iske badale ek nishchit samay main mooldhan ke saath ek nishchit ritern dene kaa vaayada kiya jaataa he
 In this way, the government will raise money by issuing sovereign bonds abroad and will invest that money in development

 Earlier, the crisis-ridden United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2013 was considering issuing sovereign bonds to raise capital from abroad, which was ultimately abandoned by the Pravasi Bharatiya (NRI) Deposit Scheme

 But at around one o'clock in the night when he was escorted by Superintendent of Police Rakesh Jolly and SDM Vishal Singh Scorpio to the streets of Greater Noida, this Congress Crown Prince asked him, "where are my arrest papers?" Then he took them to the police station
 Gaya and told that under Section-151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, no papers are required for arrest, yet they remained adamant for the papers because the law The person arrested under 151 is released only after signing the bond
 lekin jab unhone poocha ki ''kitne logon ko giraftaar karenge? puure desh ko giraftaar karenge?'' or yah spasht kar diya ki 'janata kii ladaai ladate rahe hai, ladate rahenge'' to thodi der baad tadake dhai baje dilli ke sarai kaale khan bas adde ke nikat ring road par unhen bina shart reeha kar diya gaya
 But this incident has proved to be an initiative to burn life in the cadres of the ruling party at the center, which was seen in dormancy even after a lot of efforts, a year before the assembly elections
 is ghatana ke baad pradesh bhar main hui pratikriyaaon se rajya kii mukhyamantri mayawati maano baukhala gayi
 The next day, when the Congress people were protesting across the state and giving arrests, the Bahujan Samaj Party supremo held a press conference in Lucknow and said, "looks like they are not running in their own party, that's why coming to Uttar Pradesh Doing drama
 '' unhone dhamkee bhare andaaj main yah bhi kaha ki ashaanti failaane waalon se kadai se nibata jayega
 Thus, a war between an empress and a crown prince seems to be turning into a battle between the BSP ruling in the state and the Congress ruling in the center, which the Congress had long needed
 rahul kii giraftaar ke agle din congress kaaryakartaaon ne pradesh bhar main virodh pradarshnon ke baad giraftaaryaan deen or yah daur abhi chal rahaa he
 In order to establish its identity as an aggressive opposition party, the party has chalked out many year-long programs and a conference of state party workers is held in Varanasi on 18-19 next week where in the presence of party president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul These programs related to the assembly election year are going to be finalized

 Four years of the state government have been completed and every party is gearing up for next year's assembly elections

 Here the party is sometimes becoming the SP or the bsp's hanger and often it is not able to decide who is their enemy number one
 vah praayah inamen se ek ko milakar duusare kaa shikaar karne kii ranneeti apanaati rahi he, lekin is ranneeti main uskaa khud kaa hi shikaar hota gaya he
 Currently, it has just 20 mlas in the 403-member assembly and the BJP, SP and BSP have not only littered its mass base, but have also been shaving its mlas
 vaise, kehane ko to pradesh main congress ke 58 lakh sadsy hai, par unki mehnat kisi chunaav main parilakshith nahin hoti
 Although the state has 22 of the 80 members in the Lok Sabha, their victory in the 2009 elections was considered a result of the division of votes in the state
 sonia or rahul ko loksabhaa main bhejne vaale pradesh main party kii yah badahaali nehru khandaan ke in sadasyon ko salti he to isamen koi aashcharya kii baat nahin he
 That is why the resurgence of the party in Uttar Pradesh is agenda number one of Rahul Gandhi
 pichley varshon main ve purv british videsh mantri david miliband se lekar microsoft mukhiya bill gates tak ko uttar pradesh ke gaanvon kii dhul khilaate rahe hai
 If he raised the issue of farmers and weavers in Parliament, he has made the Bundelkhand zone as if it was a land of experiment
 ve ise pruthak rajya banane kii bhi maang kar chuke hai
 Recently, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Rahul held a rally at Banda in Bundelkhand region and made many allegations against the state government
 is tarah, jahaan 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad shuruaati varshon main sonia-rahul ke daure amethi-raibareli yani unke loksabhaa nirvachan kshetron ke baahar kabhi-kabhaar hi hote the, vahiin ab unhone is daayre ko todaa he
 Also, since this time his emphasis has been to attract the Dalit and Muslim voters, especially the Congress, who are widely considered to be with the BSP, then Mayawati is envious
 jaahir taur par aagaamee saal rahul ke liye sarvaadhik ahm hoga
 He has been campaigning for the membership of the Youth Congress and several measures are being taken to prevent rigging of the party membership and to become genuine members
 pradesh ke kai jilon main yah abhiyaan puraa ho gaya jabaki pashchimi jilon main pichley hafte hi shuru hua he
 If the party was looking for issues to get its workers on the road, then they have also got involved with the harassment of farmers in Greater Noida
 bataate hai ki sabhi saansadon or anya pramukh netaaon ko apane pasand kii aisi do-teen siten sujhane ko kaha gaya he jahaan ummidavaar unki marji se die jaaenge or unako jitwakar laana unki jimmedaari ho
 Not only this, the party has directed its cadres from the capital Lucknow to the district level to take advantage of the Right to Information Act to expose the lacunae in the implementation of centrally sponsored schemes
 jahaan rahul or pradesh congress adhyaksh reeta bahuguna joshi ne pichley dinon lakhanu main suchanadhikaar aavedan jari kar rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan ke kriyanvayan kii jaankaree maangi he vahiin party kaaryakartaaon ne saikadon kii sankhya main aise aavedan kiye hai
 Significantly, this was Rahul Gandhi's 9th visit to Uttar Pradesh in the last year and a half
 or jahaan ve rajya ke har anchal main jate hai, vahiin unki maa or congress adhyaksh sonia bhi takaraav se chooktin nahin
 Two years ago, when she was prevented from holding a rally in Rae Bareli, she sat on a dharna there
 koi aashcharya kii baat nahin ki jis teji se rahul ne kisaanon ke utpeedan ke is masale ko hathohath liya usase bhaajapa or sapa bhi hairaan ho gayi
 Even BJP veteran LK Advani and party MP Varun Gandhi praised Rahul and BJP leaders also organized a fast the next day to erase the blush, that too in Ghaziabad, away from the spot
 kisaanon kii raajnneeti karne vaali sapa or rashtriya lokdal bhi is prakaran main rahul jaisi teji nahin dikhaa sake
 However, when Mayawati attacked "why the central government does not proceed with the Land Acquisition Bill?", The next day Union Home Minister P
P
 chidambaram ne kaha, ''yah vidheyak sansad ke monsoon satr main pesh kar diya jayega
 "but will Rahul's fast going to celebrate his 41st birthday next month will revive the party in the state?" Now that the BSP and the main opposition party have declared three-fourths of their candidates and have taken their electoral battle to the ground, both the Congress and the BJP are still in the process of creating an upper air
 bhaajapa ne bhi pichley dinon rajya main aadha darjan mahaasangram reliyaan yojit kii thim vahiin congress ab sadak par utar rahi he
 Right now, where the BSP has 226 assembly seats, the SP has 87 seats

 This desire to be seen as the main competitor in front of the ruling party, the Congress is losing hands, especially after the unexpected success in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
