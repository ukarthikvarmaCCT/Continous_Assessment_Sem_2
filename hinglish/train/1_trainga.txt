 We have thousands of students
 hamaari madad kiijie
 ' hamane naukari series ke dauraan 50 se adhik episod kiye, is ummid main ki chayan aayogon main kuch sudhaar aayega
 This fraud will stop in the name of jobs and exams with youth
 aisi pariksha vyavastha banegi jis par sabakaa bharosa hoga lekin jab aap in parikshaon kii nazar se bharat ko dekhenge, inamen shaamil naujavaanon kii nazar se bharat ko dekhenge to kaaphi hataasha hogi
 Ask these students what is the big news in their eyes, they will tell when the date of our examination will come, when the result of the examination given
 zarur in chaatro main aise bhi bahut hai jo din raat hindu muslim dibet main lage rahete hai magar unka bhi sawaal he ki pariksha kaa riselt kab aayega
 Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has said that the government will bear the expenses of students coming to the center when this exam is held again
 lekin is baar jo unki jeb se karodon rupee duube hai, uskaa kya hoga
 In its investigation, the ATS was also deployed, which is made to investigate terrorist activities
 kya paper li karne waalon kaa network aatank ke network se bhi khatarnaak ho gaya he
 This is not the first time the form has been leaked
 29 july ko teacher aptitude test hua tha
 One and a half lakh youth had appeared in that examination but the form was leaked in that too
 police ne apni jaanch main ise sahi bhi paaya
 As a result, the exam was canceled in October, now the same exam will be held in January
 hamane is khabar ko kyon liya
 So because you roam from state to state, the day and night of youngsters preparing for government exams is cut with this concern
 dilli se aane vaale bade bayanon kii khabaron ke bich ye lakhon noujvaan apni chintaa kii khabaren dhund rahe hote hai
 They have understood what governments are doing in the name of giving them jobs
 aaj hi subah ek messej aayaa ki 'ham RBI assistant recruitment ke ummidavaar hai
 Our first exam was held in November 2017

 Language proficiency test was conducted in March 2018
 lekin march se november biit gaya uskaa riselt nahin aayaa he
 We have been waiting for the result for 8 months
 ham chaatro kii sankhya hazaron main he
 Help us ' We did more than 50 episodes during the Job series, hoping that there would be some improvement in the selection commissions
 naujavaanon ke saath naukari or pariksha ke naam par yah dhokhadhadi band ho jaaegi
 There will be such an examination system, which will be trusted by all, but when you look at India from the point of view of these exams, there will be a lot of frustration when you look at India from the point of view of the youth involved in it
 in chaatro se puuchhie ki unki nazar main badi khabar kya he, ve yahi bataaenge ki hamaari pariksha kaa date kab aayega, jo pariksha di he uskaa riselt kab aayega
 Of course there are many among these students who are engaged in Hindu Muslim Debate day and night, but they also have a question as to when the result of the examination will come
 hamane naukari series ke dauraan 50 se adhik episod kiye, is ummid main ki chayan aayogon main kuch sudhaar aayega
 This fraud will stop in the name of jobs and exams with youth
 aisi pariksha vyavastha banegi jis par sabakaa bharosa hoga lekin jab aap in parikshaon kii nazar se bharat ko dekhenge, inamen shaamil naujavaanon kii nazar se bharat ko dekhenge to kaaphi hataasha hogi

 Book: Singal Man: The Life and Times of Nitish Kumar of Bihar Writer: Shankarshan Thakur Prakash: Harper Collins This book came out before the Lok Sabha elections last year
 lekin aaj jab bihar dobaaraa apni sarkaar chunane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he to yah or bhi maujuun ho jaati he
 Born in Patna, Sankarshan Thakur writes in the first line, 'patna is not a nice place to be
 ' phir bhi lautakar patna jate hai or lalu yadav ke baad ab nitish kumaar kii raajnneetik biography rachate hai
 There is such a stretch in Bihar and its politics
 tabhi to bihar chunaav aaj rashtriya charchaa bana hua he
 Nitish, who did not understand Marxism This book is not only interesting and informative for people of Bihari background, but also helps people outside the state to understand the socio-political fabric of the state
 jati bihar kaa sabase bada sach he
 In a conversation with the author, Nitish himself says, 'marx's slave capitol was read all over and left over his head
 marks main kahin cast kaa zikr hi nahin he
 It seemed strange
 cast hamaari sabase badi rielity he
 'perhaps with this truth in mind, Nitish Kumar has now formed a grand alliance
 unheen lalu yadav ke saath jinke liye 1992 main unhone kah diya tha, ‘ab saath chal paanaa mushkil he
 i think it appropriate to do politics only after separating
 ’ usee congress ke saath, jiske liye chaatr jivan main lohiavaadi nitish kaha karte the ki ‘is party ne aankh khulte hi dhokhaa diya
 'history of Nitish's career' Namashankaran is the roaming editor of 'the Telegraph'
 unhone yah kitaab likhane ke liye bhi bihar kii sadaken naapi hai
 From Nitish's family members to his secret mistry Ramchandra Babu aka RCP, they have fabricated the facts
 aaaraseepi upi cader se us daur ke iees rahe hai jab indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad rajeev gandhi piem bane the
 At the same time, RCP took mapping of each Lok Sabha constituency, demographic pattern, caste mathematics and first hand training of political tactics
 isi training ne 2005 main nitish ko pasmanda musalamaanon ke vot dilaae or unka rajtilak hua
 Before this coronation, what papad had to be made by Nitish, Sankarshan has told it in detail
 kaise 1977 main pehali baar vidhansabha chunaav ladane vaale nitish 11 saal tak haarate gaye
 In what mood did these 11 years pass
 kaise vijay krishna ne unhen thekedaar banate-banate roak liya
 How he won the Lok Sabha election for the first time in 1989 on a Janata Dal ticket
 lalu ke mandal kamishan kii siforishein lagu karne ke baad nitish kaise kurmi-koiri samudaay ke maseehaa ho gaye
 Lalu's mistreatment of Sarju Rai led to the politics of letters and how the two Lohianists' paths of student life diverged
 kaise nitish kaa paariwarik jivan raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon kii aahuti chadh gaya
 How Nitish, who was married at the age of 22, remained separated from his wife Manju most of the time
 or aakhir main siem awaas kii dehri dekhe bina hi unki patni chal bases
 'will gain power, no matter what' this book of Shankarshan can be called pro-nitish
 lekin vah puri kitaab main is chintaa se bephikr dikhte hai
 For the tenure of lalu-rabri, Sankarshan himself called it from his nephew's mouth - 'this is Bihar, Jungleraj
 ’ shankarashan kitaab kii shuruyaat us bihar ke nitish kii kahani se karte hai, jisaki rajdhani patna ke bazaar main aaj bhi tej aawaaj main bhojpuri gaanaa sunai padataa he- karejavaa lagaaile bidesiya, bijauli casal angiya
 
 
 Bihari Aura glows on every page of it
 shankarashan ne nayaa bihar kaa sapana dekhne vaale nitish ke jivan ke har hisse kii kahani 11 hisson main kahi he
 The story of the Nitish who used to say as a student leader - 'I will get power, by hook or by crook
 lekin satta lekar acha kaam karuunga
 'story of the MP Nitish who used to speak when asked to repair the house- Before' Bihar Banana Hai 'build your own house
 or ant us nitish par karte hai jo june 2013 main endie se alag hokar akelaa hi nikal padaa tha
 On the path of trust brought about by the change that came from his 9 years of work
 us nitish par jisane ek baar phir single main banakar akele chalane kii thaan lee thi
 On the Nitish who opened his front against Narendra Modi for his principles
 lalu chillaaye- 'sarkaar hathiyanna chahta he kaa nitishwa'kitaab kii sabase khaas baat he isaki bhashaa
 The language to say what is said, which is the signature of Bihar, is an appeal
 jo har panne, har kisse se baandhe rakhti he
 For example, 'nitish was always angry'
 lalu screemd- 'nikal baahar, baahar nikal saalaa
 The government wants to grab Nitishwa
 tum hamako rajpaat sikhaaoge
 Power comes from governance
 power vot bank se miltaa he
 Meets Peepul
 sheshnava pagalaa gaya he kaa
 Kumbh is conducting elections
 hawa badal gaya he
 People are roaming free
 dar nahin he luccha-lafanga, chhina-jhapati kaa
 The traffic is very fast, people are also dying in an accident
 'kitaab sochane ko majaboor karti he ki aakhir jin vajahon se nitish ne jin logon kaa saath choda, aaj vahi log unheen vajahon se unke ird-gird kaise hai
 Is Nitish, who talks about breaking the caste and doing good work by taking power, is caught in the cycle of caste? Or is Nitish Lohiaist no longer a Khanty leader? Or is his motive still by hook or crook, gaining power and doing good work again
 makasad jo bhi ho, ye public he sab jaanati he
 She will also decide

 In the year 1856, he joined the Presidency College in Calcutta and became the first Indian to receive a BA degree from the Presidency College during the First Independence Movement of 1857
 unhone kaanoon kii degree bhi hasil kii or pita kii ajna kaa paalan karte hue unhone 1858 main hi dipti magistrate kaa padbhaar sambhala or 1891 main sarkari seva se ritair hue
 He was a sugad reader and made a considerable inroads into Bengali and Sanskrit literature
 sarkari naukari main rahete hue unhone 1857 ke pratham swatantraaa andolan, jise angrej gadar kehete the, par angrejon kii pratikriya or bharatiyon par unke damanchakra ko bahut najadik se dekha tha
 During this period, there was an accidental change in the Indian system of governance, and the burden of governance fell in the hands of Queen Victoria rather than in the hands of the East India Company
 kehane ko to bhartiya sidhe mahaan british samrajya kii praja ban gaye the, par unka jivan or bhi dubhar ho gaya tha
 Being in a government job, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay could not directly participate in any public movement, but his mind was troubled
 at: unhone sahitya ke madhyam se swatantraaa aandolan ke liye jagriti kaa sankalp liya
 Bankim Chandra Chatterjee began writing both poetry and novels and not only excelled in both genres, but also enriched Indian literature with more than one composition
 bankim chandra chattopadhyaay kaa pehla upanyaas 'rymohans wif' angreji main tha
 In the year 1865, his first Bangla work 'durgeshnandini' was published
 us samay unki umr keval 27 varsh thi
 Then his next compositions were Kapalakundala in 1866, Mrinalini in 1869, Vishvriksha in 1873, Chandrashekhar in 1877, Rajini in 1877, Raj Singh in 1881 and Devi Chaudhurani in 1884 
 unhone 'seetaram’, ‘kamala kanter daptar’, ‘krishna kanter vil’, 'vigyaan rahasy’, 'lokarahasy’, ‘dharmatatv’ jaise granth bhi likhe
 Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay also published the monthly magazine 'bangdarshan' in the year 1872
 'bangdarshan’ ne bengali patrika kaa nayaa parv shuru kiya
 Writers like Rabindranath Thakur came into the field of literature only by writing in 'bang Darshan'
 ve bankimchandra chatarji ko apana guru bhi maanate the
 He said, 'bankim is a guru of Bangla writers and a friend of Bangla readers
 ' bankim chandra chattopadhyaay kaa sabase charchit upanyaas 'aanandamath' 1882 main prakashit hua, jisase prasiddh geet 'vande maataram' liya gaya he
 Anandamath describes the Brahmin army of Indian Muslims and ascetics fighting for the salaries of the East India Company
 haalanki yah kitaab hinduon or musalamaanon ke bich ekta kaa aahvaan karti he, par vahaan ke halaaton ke varnan ke chalate is upanyaas par kaaphi vivaad bhi rahaa, jiskaa zikr 'sahitya ajtak' ke ek alag lekh main kiya gaya he
 However, the fame of the song 'vande Mataram' was that it was composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore himself
 sach kahen to bangala sahitya kii marfat bhartiya janamanas tak paith banane waalon main bankim chandra chattopadhyaay vah pehle sahityakar hai, jinhen vishwavyaapee khyaati mili
 Translations of his works were done in many languages of the world, and films were made on many
 yah ek durlabh gun tha ki sarkari naukari main rahete hue bhi bankim chandra chattopadhyaay ne apane lekhan se desh main rashtrawaad kaa alakh jagaaya
 On the one hand, it was possible only for Bankim to serve foreign government and create high quality literature for the country's renaissance
 aaj bhi bankimchandra chattopadhyaay kii lokapriyata kaa yah alam he ki pichley dedh sau saalon se unke upanyaas vibhinn bhashaaon main anudit ho rahe hai or kai-kai sanskaran prakashit ho rahe hai
 In her novels, the insight and power of women is expressed in a very effective way
 unke upanyaason main nari kii garima ko nayi pahchaan mili he or bhartiya itihaas ko samajhane kii nayi drushti
 He was adept at writing historical novels
 unhen bharat kaa elexander duma bhi kaha gaya
 Thakur Rabindranath Tagore once said, 'rammohan advanced Bang literature with immersion, Bankim flowed talent over him
 bankim ke kaaran hi aaj bangabhasha maatr praudh hi nahin, urvara or shasyashyamla bhi ho saki he'
 On April 8, 1894, not only Bengal but the whole of India sank in mourning with the death of the mother of Bharat Mata, a great literary serviceman, a countryman and a true Indian

 The Maharashtra government then presented the documents against Navlakha in a sealed envelope before the Supreme Court opposing the plea to quash the FIR during the hearing in the case

 The social worker was told in front of the court that he was ready for questioning, but he pleaded for protection from arrest
 pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) ne guuruuvaar ko meerut se apane loksabhaa chunaav prachaar abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kar di
 In this sequence, he addressed a rally in Jammu (jammu Rally)
 raily ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'meraa saubhaahgya he ki 2019 ke chunaav ke liye jab main puure desh se aashirwad lene niklaa hum to pehle din mujhe mata vaishno devi kaa aashirwad praapt hua he
 He said, "the valor of Dogars and the sacrifice and penance of Premnath Dogra ji running in the veins of us BJP people are giving us new vigor
 11 april ko jab aap camel ke phool ke saamne vaale iviem kaa batan dabaaenge, to uski aawaaj desh ke bheetar jame aatankiyon or unke saathiyon main to khalabali machayegi hi or saath main seemaa paar bhi uski gunj sunai degi
 Taking a dig at the Congress, PM Modi said, 'I do not understand if this is the same Congress in which Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose had imagined an independent India
 seemapar aatank kii factory chalaane vaale aaj khauf main hai
 This is the first time that terrorists who are coming across the border to terrorize India are also thinking 100 times today
 puraa desh aaj ek sur or ek swar main baat kar rahaa he, lekin congress ke netaa duusare hi sur alaap rahe hai
 After the air strike in Balakot, Congress leaders are talking about something that is not in favor of India
 itnaa hi nahin, jammu kashmir ke netaa bhi aisi baat kar rahe jo gaanv main rahane vaale logon ko manjuur nahin he
 PM Modi, who spoke in Rudrapur after Meerut, did not apologize to those who became the heroes of Pakistan
 magar chaukeedaar se jaise taise chhutkaaraa mil jaae or ye mahamilavati dilli main baith jaaen
 But is this acceptable to the country? The Guru of the Congress Namdar, who sets the policy of the Congress, is giving a clean chit to the terrorists in front of the media on Indian soil without any shame
 jab guru hi aisa hoga, to chela kaisaa hoga or chele ke saathi kaise honge?'piem modi bole- main 8 saal kaa tha tab se sun rahaa hum ki congress garibi hataa rahi he, lekin garibi nahin hatipiem ne congress ke saath-saath jammu kashmir kii partiyon neshnal conference or pidipi par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'do teen din pehle jo hua wo or sharmnaak he
 The entire nation has seen this statement made by a National Conference candidate
 desh ye bhi dekh rahaa he kaise congress ne in logon ke saath haath milaayaa he
 Does the Congress have a hand with such people who speak against India? The Congress, National Conference and PDP are responsible for the situation in Jammu and Kashmir today
 inhen ke kaaran kashmiri panditon ko itnaa kuch sahanaa padaa
 These people are also responsible for the poison that has spread in terrorism
 ye wo log hai jinhone bharat ke samarthy par bhi kabhi bharosa nahin kiya
 They do not have the courage to take big and tough decisions
 ye mare-pade log hai
 "be it land, sky, or space
" 
 The courage of the surgical strike was shown by the same watchman, '10 special things', whether the terrorists' companions are crossing the border or listening to one thing within the country, a single step taken against India will be overwhelming
 aapane mujhe nikatataa se dekha he
 You will remember that day of two and a half decades ago, while flaunting the tricolor at Lal Chowk, what i said today, i am still carrying the same spirit, same attitude
 satta ke moh main na maine apana rup badla he or aage bhi aisi koi gunjaaish nahin he
 'today, security agencies are doing their job, checking links linked to the funding of terrorists
 aaj jab main puraani reeti ko badal rahaa hum to congress, ensi or pidipi ko neend nahin aa rahi he
 They are engaged in abusing the watchman

 PM Modi said, 'congress, NC and PDP have all cheated and discriminated against Jammu

 As far as India is concerned, people are now more alert towards safe sex
 phir bhi kuch kshetron main jaagarukta kaa abhaav najar aata he
 In a survey, it was found that in Orissa, more than 37 percent of girls get married before 18 years and 13 percent of boys get married before 21 years
 rajya main unicef kii pramukh sheros maavji ne ek kaarykram ke dauraan yah khulaasa kiya
 They reported that over 14% of girls aged 15 to 19 were found to be mothers or pregnant during the National Family Health Survey in 2005-06
 agar ham viksit desh america kii baat karen, to vahaan kii sthiti kuch alag he
 In the US, the rate of childbirth by adolescent girls reached the lowest level in 2009, but this rate remained the highest among developed countries

 Ever since the news of Kareena Kapoor Khan's pregnancy has come, there has been an influx of people congratulating her, but it seems that Saif Ali Khan's ex-wife Amrita Singh is not at all happy with this news
 bollywoodlife kii ek patrkaar ne jabakreena kii pregnancy kii newspapamritaki pratikriya jaanane ke liye phone kiya to amrutha buree tarah se gussa ho gayi
 Amrita told the journalist, 'how dare you call and ask such questions? Who are you? Don't call me again? 'let me tell you that Saif and Amrita's marriage lasted more than 12 years
 donon ne 1991 main shaadi kii thi or 2004 main alag ho gaye the
 They have a son Ibrahim and a daughter Sara
 kuch dinon pehle hi saf ne media ko bataaya tha ki disambar main karina unke pehle bachche ko janm dengi
 Saif and Karinane got married in the year 2012
 uttar pradesh ke banaras loksabhaa seat par bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi ko takkar denge ajay raay
 After a long wait, finally on Tuesday, the Congress declared its candidate
 congress ne sthaneey vidhayak ajay raay ko pratyaashee banaaya he
 With this, a triangular contest will be seen in the high profile seat of Benares
 aapako bataa den ki aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal pehle hi janata se raishumaari ke baad yahaan se chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar chuke hai
 Ever since the announcement of Narendra Modi contesting from Banaras, such speculations were being made that the Congress could field a strong candidate here
 digvijay singh or anand sharma ke naam ko lekar atakalon kaa bazaar garm rahaa
 Ultimately, the Congress put a stop to these speculations by giving tickets to Ajay Rai
 congress ne apane faisle kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki ajay raay jamini netaa hai or vah varanasi kii sthaneey samasyaon se avgat hai
 The decision was taken only after taking suggestions from Sonia Gandhi
 i-kamrs company snapdil 10 karod dollar (kareeb 665 karod rupee) shopo main nivesh karegi
 The company aims to add 1 million vendors to the recently launched platform
 july main shuru shopo mobile only platform he jiskaa makasad un choti evam evam majholi companiyon (esaimbi) ko ek manch par laana he jo bade i-kamrs portal par panjikaran nahin kara sakati
 Kunal Bahl, Snapdeal co-founder and CEO (CEO) said, "we started Shopo in mid-july and we have already connected the platform to 20,000 shops
" hamen jo pratikriya mili he, vah shandaar he
 He said that our team is confident of adding 10 lakh shops to Shoppo in the next one year

 input : bhashaa The petition filed against Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has been turned down by the Election Commission
 sisodiya ke pad ko laabh kaa pad bataate hue ye yachika daayar kii gai thi
 In which action was demanded against Sisodia
 bijepi se jude ek vakil ne yah yachika teen maheene pehle daakhil kii thi
 The Commission, finding no facts in this petition, dismissed it
 ayog ne apane aadesh main saaf kaha ki is yachika main koi merit nahin he
 After this order of the Election Commission, it became clear that the post of Deputy Chief Minister in Delhi is not of profit
 jiske baad manish sisodiya kii sadsyta par chhaae ashanka ke badal chant gaye hai
 On the other hand, 21 mlas of Aam Aadmi Party have also had a case of office of profit
 raashtrapati ne shikaayat milane ke baad ye maamla mukhya chunaav ayog ke yahaan bheja tha
 Where this issue has been heard many times
 ayog ne is maamle main sabhi vidhayakon kaa paksh bhi janaa he
 All the legislators have given their clarification in writing to the Commission
 ayog ne is par apnaafaisla surakshitarakh liya he
 The Commission will send its views to the President, as the President had asked him for advice in this matter
 bataa den ki aarope laga tha kiam aadmi partiki dilli sarkaar ne apane vidhayakon ko niyamon ke khilaaf jakerlabh ke padadie the
 If the Commission believes that the responsibilities of the mlas, which were given to them, fall within the purview of the office of profit, then their membership may be threatened
 yah kahawat shaayad taxeshan kii duniya ke liye hi bani hogi ki aam maafee un aparaadhiyon ke prati sarkaar kii udaartaa hoti he jinhen sajaa dena bahut mahangaa padataa he
 The amnesty (amnesty?) Of tax evaders and black money is decided by governments with reluctance, as it is always unethical to allow tax evaders to escape without punishment
 isliye agar is sahuuliyat ke jariye paryaapt kaala dhan bhi na aae to sarkaar kii saakh kshat-vikshat ho jaati he
 This is what has happened with the NDA government, in trying to fulfill a base-foot electoral promise of black money stashed abroad, the credibility of the Indian tax system has been deeply scratched
 aadhi-adhuri taiyaariyon or jaldbaaji main liye gaye faislon ke kaaran, sajaa se maafee dekar videsh main jamaa kaala dhan baahar nikaalane kii koshish aundhe munh giri he
 Tax evaders have also not relied on the generosity of the government
 aam chunaavon ke dauraan videsh se kaala dhan laakar logon ke khate main jamaa karne ke vaade par sawaalon main ghirne ke baad sarkaar ne bajet satr main sansad se ek kanoon (andisclosed fahrren inakam and esets bill, 2015) paarit karaayaa tha, jiske tahat sarkaar ne videsh main kaala dhan rakhane waalon ko yah suvidha di thi ki 1 july se 1 aktubar ke bich yadi videsh main chipaaya dhan ghoshit karte hue tex (30 fisad) or penalty (tex kaa shat pratishat) chukaai jaati he to karrwai nahin hogi
 At the end of the period in three months, only Rs 4,147 crore
 kaa kaala dhan ghoshit hua he, jis par sarkaar ko adhiktam 2,000 karod ru
 Tax of Rs
 is saal march main isi stambh main hamane likhaa tha ki 1997 kii kaala dhan swaghoshnaa (vidiies) skim main gopneeyata ke vaade ke baad bhi companiyon par karrwai hui thi, isliye kanoon ke tahat badi ghoshnaaen hone par shaq he lekin yah anumaan katai nahin tha ki videsh main kaala dhan hone ke abhootpurv rajnatik aankadon ke baavjood itani kam ghoshnaaen hongi
 It is necessary to get to the bottom of the failure of the amnesty scheme
 kaale dhan ko lekar is badi pahal kii naakaami sarkaar ko nausikhua va jaldbaaj sabit karti he
 In fact, the finance ministry had no concrete information about black money stashed abroad
 aisi koshishen kam hi deshon ne kii he kyonki inaki vifaltaa kaa khatra zyada hota he
 India's previous successful schemes also focused on indigenous black money
 haal main italy or america ne videsh main jamaa kaale dhan par emnesti scimen safalataa se puri kii hai jinke liye videsh se suchanaaen jutakar majboot jameen taiyaar kii gai thi jabaki apana vitt mantralay is maamle main bilkul andhere main he
 The government has started trying to get information by sending about 3,200 requests to all the countries and tax havens in the world, whose answers are yet to come
 sarkaar ke paas jo jaankariyaan uplabdh hai, ve thos nahin thim, isliye tir ulataa aakar laga he
 The finance minister of the party which was claiming huge black money abroad had to say after the grand failure of this scheme that India does not have black money abroad
 ranneetik chookeyemnesti skiimon kaa laabh lene kii koshish vahi log karte hai jinhen sajaa kaa dar hota he
 But the Ministry of Finance had taken active actions in various cases, even surveys, out of this scheme
 isliye jo log karrwai ke dar se skim main aa sakate the unhen bhi mauka nahin mila
 This is a major strategic lapse
 bharose kaa sawaldhakar vibhaag ko maaloom tha ki puraane tajurbon kii roshni main is suvidha par log aasaani se vishwaas nahin karenge
 To make the scheme a success, there should have been an attempt to increase trust in the tax administration, but on the one hand the government was giving amnesty to declare black money, on the other hand investors and companies were given MAT (minimum Alternative Tax) and notice for old cases Were being sent is asangati ne kar prashasan par bharose ko kamjor kiya or skim kii vifaltaa sunishchit kar di
 Incomplete Preparation: The Ministry of Finance did not prepare for amnesty
 skim ko lekar spashtikaran der se aae or sabase badi baat, prachaar main bahadur sarkaar ne apni mahatvakankshi skim kaa koi prachaar nahin kiya, khaas taur par videsh main to katai nahin, jahaan based bhartiya iske sabase bade graahak the
 International experiences show that direct and indirect campaigns are carried out on such schemes so that more and more people can become part of it and ensure success
 kaale dhan par aam maafee kii asafalataa kii tulana 18 saal pehle kii vidiies skim se kii jaaegi
 Then 36,697 crores under it
 kaale dhan kii ghoshnaa hui thi, jo maujuuda skim main kii gai ghoshnaaon kaa das guna he
 Not only this, it (america $ 5 billion) and Italy (1) in extracting black money from abroad
 4 arab euro) kii taaja safaltaaon kii roshni main bhi dekha jayega
 India's tax administration's credibility has fallen sharply in the last sixteen months, from frivolities on election promises to notice to investors and their withdrawal and the failure of the amnesty scheme
 bainkon ke jariye kaala dhan videsh le jane ke taaja maamle ne kar prashasan kii nigahabaani ke daavon ko bhi dho diya he
 People's lack of confidence in the government's general amnesty is a major failure, which will have long-term impact on the credibility and morale of the administration
 bharat ke tex system ko is haadase se ubarne main lanbaa vakt lag saktaa he
 On the second day of the Punjab tour, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi made a 6-km trek to Bathinda in an attempt to revive the state Congress

 Both actors have been in Delhi for a few weeks in connection with the shooting of Imtiaz Ali's film
 shooting ke dauraan kii kuch tasviren or video share ho rahe hai
 Recently a video was shared in which both were seen riding bikes on the streets of Delhi
 film kii baat karen to ise saal 2020 velentine de ke maukey par relies kiya jayega
 If the status of your train ticket comes in the RAC, then forget that you will get a confirmed berth
 kyonki, rail mantralay ne aarasi tikat vaale ko aadhe berth par safar karwaane kaa faisla kiya he
 But you will be fully charged for this
 railway ne iske liye circular bhi jari kar diya he
 In its circular, Raelven has increased the number of RAC berths, which has also been implemented with immediate effect
 railway ke is faisle se railway ke rajasav main badhotaree to ho jaaegi, lekin yatriyon kii pareshaani badhani tay he
 Because RAC berths can be traveled in any way during the day, but it is not easy to shrink to half seat during the night
 railway kii badhegi kamairelway ke aalaa afasaron ke mutabik, said kii berth puri tarah se aarasi karne se railway ko ek saal main takreeban 1500 karod rupee kaa phayda ho paaegaa
 This will allow more passengers to travel on one side, while on the other hand the losses of the railway will be reduced to some extent, but in terms of passenger convenience, this decision cannot be called very good, because you will give the money for full berth
 , But will travel by sitting
 in kochon main hogi aarasi berthyah badhotaree sleeper, thri-tear or tu-tear asi shrenee ke coach main kii gai he
 According to the circular, now 7 seats of side lower have been reserved for RAC in every coach of sleeper class, that means a total of 14 passengers will travel on them
 pehle isamen 5 siten aarasi ke liye thi, jinpar 10 yatri safar karte the
 At the same time, the number of RAC berths has been reduced to 4 in every coach of three-tier AC class, on which 8 passengers will be able to travel
 pehle isamen 2 sitenaresike liye thi, jinpar 4 yatri safar karte the
 Similarly, in every coach of two-tier AC class, 3 berths have now been reserved for RAC, on which 6 passengers will be able to travel
 pehle isamen 2 berth the, jinpar 4 yatri baithkar safar karte the
 Decision is not right for passenger comfort, on the one hand, the Ministry of Railways claims to increase passenger facilities, on the other hand, it is constantly taking such decisions, which makes the journey of railways difficult rather than pleasant
 aarasi kotadoguna karne par puraa paisa dene ke baavjood logon ko baithkar hi jane ko milegaa
 The special thing is that after this system is in place, it will happen that if your ticket is not confirmed, then the expectation of getting confirmed will be reduced
 saath hi, aap paise to puri seat ke denge, lekin aapako milegi aadhi seat jis par aap letkar nahin, balki baithkar safar puraa karenge
 Obviously, this decision of the Ministry is not very good for railway passengers

 As soon as this process starts, the effect starts

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the process of demonetisation in the second week of November and declared the 14 lakh crore currency (in 500 and 1000 notes) operating in the country's economy as illegal
 is elaan kaa vakt desh ke share bazaar main listed companiyon ke liye badi musiibat banakar saamne khadaa he
 Demonetization and Listed Companies: Immediately after the announcement, a campaign has been started to exchange illegal notes in all the business of the country along with the common man
 iskaa sidhaa asar share bazaar par bhi pad rahaa he
 The share prices of most companies are continuously declining
 is giravat ke alaava bhi share bazaar main listed companiyon ke liye yah prakriya behad gambhir nattejey dene ja rahi he
 Actually, the month of November is in the middle of the third quarter (october, November and December) of the listed companies
 disambar khatm hote hi sabhi companiyon ko 45 din ke bheetar apana timahi nateeja share bazaar se saajha karnaa hoga
 Now the biggest concern of the companies is that the currency crisis that started in the middle of the third quarter will disturb their business for the next few months and one thing is clear that their quarterly results coming in early January may have fallen flat
 kyon companiyaan detii hai timahi natijashare bazaar main list hone vaali companiyon ke liye praavdhaan he ki vah ek vitt varsh main chaar baar company kaa inakam, expendichar or munaafe kaa puraa byora saajha karen
 The fiscal year in the country starts from April and ends in March of the new year
 lihaaja companiyon ke liye pehali timahi april-may-june, duusari timahi july-agast-sitambar, teesri timahi oktober-november-disambar or chauthi timahi janvari-farvari-march hoti he
 Through these quarterly results, companies give complete information about their financial health to the stock market

 a better result for any quarter increases the stock price of companies
 uske sheyaron kii kharidari bad jaati hai
 At the same time, poor quarterly results make companies lose in the stock market as investors start turning away from the company
 teesri timahi kyon hoti he sabase mahatvapoornkendra sarkaar ke bajet kii tarah hi prayek vitt varsh kii shuruyaat main sabhi companiyaan apana vaarshik plan taiyaar karti he
 Preparations to implement this annual plan are usually made in the first quarter

 During the second quarter, the entire emphasis of the company remains in giving effect to its annual plan
 aamtaur par is timahi main company apana kharch badha detii he
 The third quarter is very important according to the annual plan of any company
 vistaar sambandhi sabhi kaam duusari timahi main puraa kiya ja chukaa hota he
 The focus of the companies in this quarter is to increase their income
 festive sijan kii shuruyaat se lekar nae saal se, vahiin chauthi timahi shuru hote hi ek baar phir companiyon kii praathamikta vaarshik hisaab-kitaab ko puraa karnaa or karj ityadi ko paatane kii ho jaati he
 Currency crisis continues, companies will fall in peak season by the third quarter, purchasing capacity in the country increases

 The money reaches the pockets of farmers in the country during October, November and December
 iske chalate companiyon kii najar desh kii rural market par rahati he
 At the same time, the purchasing power of the urban market increases in these months in the festive season of Deepawali, Durga Puja and New Year
 lekin dimonetigeshan ke asar se november kii shuruyaat main hi desh main karency sankat shuru ho gaya he
 In this crisis, where the cash kept at home is waiting to be changed, the purchase is only needed throughout the country
 ab companiyon ko khatra is baat kaa sata rahaa he ki yadi market main karency sankat jald nahin khatm hua to urban or rural market main kharidaaron main susti rahegi or saal kii sabase mahatvapurn timahi unke liye puri dhwast ho jaaegi

 aise main shivasena or ensipi ke paas 110 siten hongi or use nirdaleey or chote dalon kaa sarmathan chahie hoga
 The fourth option is ncp's Sharad Pawar becoming the Chief Minister and supporting Congress and Shiv Sena Pawar
 is sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he khaskar tab jab saamana main shivasena ne sharad pavaar ke shaan main kaseeden likhen hai
 The fifth option is to give NCP and Congress their support to Shiv Sena
 teenon ko milakar 154 siten hoti hai jo bahumat se nau zyada he
 But the Congress may face problems in this
 chatha vikalp he bijepi or ensipi milakar sarkaar bana len
 Together, there are 159 seats, which is 14 seats more than the majority
 ensipi or bijepi kaa najadik aana koi badi baat nahin ho sakati he
 Many times there has been a strategic partnership between the two and the seventh option is for the government to form the BJP, which has the right as the largest party and is absent during the NCP voting
 tab bahumat ke liye 118 vidhayakon kii jarurat hogi jo nirdaleey or choti partiyon kii madad se puri kii ja sakati he
 As long as there is suspense on the government in Maharashtra, such options are bound to be discussed
 sabase acha hoga ki shivasena or bijepi apane matbhed bhula len or sarkaar bana len bhale hi donon ko ek-ek kadam peeche hi kyon naa kheenchna pade

 So that the person gets the ability to use it along with money

 Double Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar arrived at the court demanding the trials and also himself heard the plea of lawyers along with his coach Satpal Singh and vice-president of wrestling association Raj Singh
 susheel ne adaalat pahunch kar bada daanv lagaaya he
 Approximately 80 days of precious time is left for the Olympics to begin and the players' focus is certainly divided by Rio's preparations
 court ne is bare main khilaadiyon or federation ko naseehat bhi di ki is vakt unka dhyaan taiyaari par hona chahie
 The court said that simply accepting Sushil's plea directly could be too much for Narsingh
 adaalat ne federation ko susheel se baat karne or unhen samajhane ke bare main kaha
 The court also cited sportsmanship for Sushil
 lekin susheel ke coach satpal singh ne kaha, "court ne federation se baat karne ke baad phir se 27 may ko bulaayaa he
 This is not a setback
 " Which means that the wrestler will get the chance to go to Rio in Sushil and Narsingh, this matter has reached the Federation again
 dilli hai court ne saafe taur par kaha ki wo kushti kaa export nahin he or naa hi kushti ke chayan samiti kaa kaam kar saktaa he
 The court definitely said that the matter will not be resolved among themselves only then it will interfere in this issue
 pradhanmantri, khel mantralay or bhartiya kushti sangh ko patr likhane ke baad dabl olympic medalist susheel kumaar ne tryles ke liye adaalat kaa daravaaza to khatkhataya
 But the court expressed its inability to take a direct decision on this issue
 federation ne daleel di ki tryles karwaanaa mumkin nahin he
 Because there is a danger of Narasimh getting injured
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki susheel pehle bhi profeshnal kushti lig or duusare mauqon par narsingh se bhidane se bachate rahe hai
 After the court hearing, the Vice President of the Wrestling Federation of India said that how can any wrestler talk about fighting against the risk of injury? adaalat ne kushti sangh masale ko sulajhaakar 22 tarikh ko phir se sunwaayee kii baat kii he
 For now, it seems that Sushil will find it difficult to get a Rio ticket if there is no talk about the trials
 tippaniyan When the case of claim for 74 kg category wrestling in the Rio Olympic Games reached the High Court, the court clearly said that it will interfere in this matter only when there is no option

 After writing a letter to the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Sports and the Wrestling Federation of India, double Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar approached the court for trials
 lekin court ne is masale par sidhe taur par faisalaa lene main asamarthta jataai
 The federation argued that it was not possible to conduct the trials
 kyonki isamen narsingh ke chotil hone kaa khatara to he hi
 He also said that Sushil has been avoiding fighting against Narasimha in the Professional Wrestling League before and on other occasions
 adaalat kii sunwaayee ke baad bhartiya kushti sangh ke upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki chotil hone ke khatare se koi pahalwaan muqable ladane kii baat kaise kar saktaa he? The court has resolved the issue of wrestling association and asked for a re-hearing on 22nd

 ) chunavi safalataa se utsahit congress chaahati he ki rajya vidhansabha ke adhyaksh kaa pad sahyogi rakanpa unke liye chhod de
 The Congress has got twenty more seats in the state than the RNKP
 1999 se hi rakanpa ke paas he adhyaksh padarakanpa ke krishnarav rakhmajirao desai urf babasaheb kupekar sadan ke nivartmaan adhyaksh hai
 This post has been with NCP since 1999
 1999 main yah gathbandhan satta main aayi thi
 Congress sources said, "senior Congress leader Vilas Patil Undalkar may be the party's choice for the post of president
 unhen vis adhyaksh athwa cabinet mantri banaaya jaayegaa
 In 1999, the congress-rkp alliance wrested power from the Shiv Sena BJP alliance
 us samay se adhyaksh kaa pad rakanpa ke paas he
 The reasoning behind this was that NCP won more seats than Congress, so instead of 'sacrificing' the chief minister's post, it should be given the post of president and additional department
 rakanpa ko pramukh vibhaag dene ke mood main nahin congressvarsh 2004 main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main rakanpa ne 71 siten jiti thi jabaki congress ko keval 69 siton par jeet hasil hui thi
 Despite this, the post of Chief Minister was given to the Congress
 sutron ne kaha ki rakanpa vitt mantri dilip walse patil ko adhyaksh pad ke liye pesh kar saktaa he
 The Congress is claiming the Ministries of Home, Energy, Rural Development and Public Works which are currently with the NCP
 congress sutron ne bataaya ki haalanki rakanpa is baat ke liye taiyaar nahin hogi
 Congress is not in the mood to give major portfolios to the allies this time, like 2004
 sutron ne kaha, ‘‘rakanpa ko badale sameekaran ko samajhnaa chahie
 He can no longer claim to have more seats
 ’’ sutron ne bataaya ki rakanpa vidhansabha main jeetne vaale apane baagi netaaon ko rijhaane kii koshish kar rahi he taaki jarurat pade to congress ke saath behatar saudebaaj kii ja sake
 Film: Director of Allah: Farooq Kabirkalakar: Sharman Joshi, Farooq Kabir, Naseeruddin Shah, Anjana Sukhani a question arises while watching this film: What's new in this: Dharavi (sudhir Mishra), Slumdog Millionaire (danny Boyle) and Siti Awa Gould (mahesh Manjre ) Is not there? In this context, Farooq Kabir's film has to be watched carefully
 nirdesan or abhinay donon main yah unka pehla kadam he, jo film main bhi dikhataa he
 "the filthiest and richest place of Hindustan", he has seen the murky life of Mumbai's Dharavi from a fresh perspective
 shuru main hi chipka maaria maantesri kaa ek bodh vaakya isamen bacchon kii talim kii baat hone kii taraf ishaara kar detaa he

 sahitya ajtak ke tisare din sidhi baat manch par satr 'hindi-vindi' main hindi ke bade patrkaar or lekhak rahul dev ke saath anant vijay ne shirkat kii
 In the program, various aspects of colloquial Hindi, market Hindi and standard Hindi were discussed
 iske alaava hindi bhashaa or aalochana ke kshetra main kaam kar rahe in diggajon se hindi ke maujuuda halaat par bhi charchaa kii gai
 Discussing the growing importance of English and the situation in Hindi, senior journalist Rahul Dev said that after independence we got political independence but could not get administrative independence
 aazaadee se pehle angreji kii jo jaden british bharat lekar aae the, vahi aazaadee ke baad bhi aage badhati rahi
 Not only Hindi but English, the condition of all Indian languages seems to be suffering
 yahi vajah he ki angreji varg ne sabhi bhashaaon ko apane prabhaav main le liya he
 Sahitya Aaj Tak: 'they will shout saffron-green, you will stick to the tricolor'
 Anant Vijay, speaking on the status of Hindi, said that the administrative mistake was made by Nehru, which Hindi could not get right after independence
 aazaadee ke baad bhashaa ko lekar ghalmail vaali baaten kii gayi
 He said that the situation in Hindi is not so bad, but when we start thinking of ourselves as inferior to English, then trouble starts
 kyonki hamaari maansikta ab bhi gulaamon vaali he
 Journalist and writer Anant Vijay said that we do not have to be hostile to English, but there is no material available in Hindi on many subjects
 hamen vilaap nahin karnaa he balki hindi to hindu ke samaan he jo koi bhi aae use samahit karti rahegi
 Like the Sanatan tradition, Hindi will continue till infinity
 raashtra jab rashtrawaad banataa he to yah beemaari main tabdeel ho jaati he: professor apurvanandarahul dev ne kaha ki bhartiya bhashaaon main raajnneetik shakti he lekin angreji satta kii takat he, isi vajah se vah anya bhartiya bhashaaon ko aage aane nahin detii
 He said that the influence of English is visible everywhere
 anant ne kaha ki hindi ke logon ko bazaar se dikkat thi isi vajah se bazaar unase dur ho gaya
 The situation in Hindi has been much better than before

 iske alaava babari masjid se babari naam hataakar lakhanu main aman kii masjid banaai jaae
 He said that instead of naming this mosque after a king or ruler, it should be named masjid-e-aman
 rizvi ne apni taraf se samjhaute kii copy pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi bheji he
 Rizvi prepared a draft last year to resolve the settlement of the Ayodhya dispute, which he submitted to the Supreme Court
 bataa den ki samjhaute main rizvi ne kaha he ki vivaadit jameen par bhagwaan shriram kaa mandir bane taaki hindu or musalamaanon ke bich kaa vivaad hameshaa ke liye khatm ho or desh main aman kaayam ho sake
 The Shia Waqf Board had said that under this draft the mosque should not be built in Ayodhya, but instead in Lucknow
 iske liye puraane lakhanu ke hussainabad main ghanta ghar ke saamne shiya vakf board kii jameen he, jis par masjid banaai jaae or iskaa naam iskaa naam kisi muslim raja yaa shaasha ke naam par na hokar " masjid-e-aman" rakhi jaae
 Please tell that the Shia Board submitted the formula for the disputed case of Ayodhya to the Supreme Court on 18 November last year
 shiya central vakf board ke is masaude par dastakhat karne waalon main digambar akhaade ke suresh das, hanuman gadhi ke dharmadas, nirmohi akhaade ke bhaskar das iske alaava ram vilaas vedanti, gopaldaas or narendra giri ne bhi samarthan kiya tha
 The draft of the resolution of the Ayodhya dispute (masjid-e Aman) was filed in the Supreme Court, which was not accepted by the court
 haalanki, rizvi ne kaha tha ki hindu or shiya is par sahamat he, sunni vakf board kaa isse koi lenadena nahin he, wo bhi adaalat main he ham bhi adaalat main he court faisla karegaa
 He said that instead of Ayodhya, we have proposed in Lucknow because large land is present in front of Ghantaghar in old Lucknow, Shia population here is also quite and away from controversies, so this is our formula

 In response, he said that he would first resign

 mosul main jari jang ke dauraan jaise hi iesas ke aatankwaadi iraqi fouj se khud ko ghira pate hai, achaanak imotional drama shuru kar dete hai
 They grumble, start rolling on the streets
 betahasha rone lagate hai
 The wheel of time always turns
 zulm kii muddat zyada lambii nahin hoti
 There was a time when he used to perpetrate atrocities on others
 or ab ek vakt ye he ki khud ro rahe hai
 Weeping over its ruin, on its defeat and on its death in front
 aatankiyon ke chehre par maut kaa darbaat-baat par logon kaa sir kalam karne, unhen suuli par taangane, goli maarane or zindaa jala dene vaale aatankwaadiyon kii apni jaan par jab khud aa bani he, to wo behtasha ro rahe hai
 After being captured by the Iraqi army, winds are blowing on the faces of ISIS terrorists themselves
 dar unki ankhon ke raste baahar nikal rahaa he
 These are not the only pictures of the stronghold of ISIS, the devil of Baghdadi
 halaat ye hai ki mosul kii galiyon se ab bagdadi ke aatanki beabaru ho kar bhaag rahe hai
 Those who trusted their boss Baghdadi more than themselves, now they are crying czar after he has left
 aatankiyon ke ankhon se nikalate in aansuon ko na to bagdadi kii khilaafat roak paa rahi he
 Neither the dream of 72 Hurras nor the dream of the Islamic State
 chhodkar bhaag gaya bagdadiin aatankiyon ne kabhi khwab main bhi nahin sochaa hoga ki unka khaliph bagdadi unhen bich majdhaar main chhod kar kuch yun gaayab ho jayega
 But this is probably the fear of death
 jaan pe ban ai to khalipha to bhaag gaya lekin apni dehshat kii ummat peeche rote hue chhod gaya
 Decree not to spare terrorists, who are alive, they are crying in fear of Iraqi forces
 jo phogiyon ke kabze main hai, ve zindagi ke liye ro rahe hai
 In all, the Sultanate of Baghdadi is full of wailing
 magar iraqi sena ko hidaayat di gai he ki kisi bhi surat main in dehshatgardon ke saath raham na kiya jaae
 Seeing death in front, a month ago, through an audio message, Baghdadi encouraged his terrorists to stay in maidan-e-jung
 lekin iske baad se naa to bagdadi kaa kuch pataa he or naa hi uske khaas chamachon kaa
 In such a situation, the terrorists started thinking that Baghdadi himself had gone, but he was put to death
 imotional dramabagadadijane se pehle zamin par iraqi senaaon or aasmaan main america jangi jahaazon se ghire aatankiyon ke liye farmaan suna gaya ki jab tak maar sako maaro or jab naa maar sako to phir fidaayin banakar khud mar jaao
 But instead of dying, these terrorists have found an emotional way here
 islam kii duhairo-rokar ye aatanki apane jaisi soch rakhane vaale bhatke naujavaanon ko islam kii duhai dekar bula rahe hai
 So that they can save their own lives and sacrifice their lives in maidan-e-jung, they can fulfill the target given by Baghdadi
 apane kabze vaale ilaakon main iesas naujavaanon ko islam kii duhai dekar bargala rahaa he
 Video of such youths who have been made in the name of Mazhab is being viral in these areas, Baghdadi has thrown into this fire by making it fidayeen
 aatanki unhen shahid bataakar hero bana rahe hai

 At that time only three to five policemen were present and there was no crowd
 polin ne vahaan maujuud pulisavaalon se ambulance mangane ke liye bhi kaha tha
 Pauline claims that she also told the police not to stand quietly, call an ambulance, as we have not been able to give them (tomar) any first aid

 Pauline said that Tomar fell down in his presence after the police lathi-charged the protesters and asked Tomar to keep trying to breathe
 vahaan us samay sirf teen se paanch pulisavaale maujuud the or koi bheed nahin thi
 Pauline also asked the policemen there to call for an ambulance
 polin kaa daawa he ki usne police se yah bhi kaha tha ki chupchaap khadey mat rahiye, ambulance bulaaie, kyonki ham inhen (tomars ko) koi praathmik upachaar nahin de paae hai
 Earlier, another eyewitness named Yogendra, who was seen with Pauline in the photos, also claimed that Tomar was not beaten by a performer
 yogendra ke mutabik tomars ko koi chot nahin ai thi or vah daudte-daudte achaanak gir pade the
 Yogendra and Pauline had taken Tomar to the hospital with the help of the police
 tippaniyan On the other hand, four of the eight accused accused by the police in Tomar's death have also claimed in conversation with NDTV that they have nothing to do with the incident and the police have unnecessarily arrested them
 do aropiyon - amit joshi or kailash joshi ne daawa kiya he ki ghatana ke vakt ve metro main safar kar rahe the or is vaardaat se unka koi naata nahin he
 In this case, the Patiala House Court of Delhi has also issued notices to DMRC and Delhi Police

 Sajid Khan's film Humshakals and the Qtiyapa video making fun of CID, a detective show running on Sony TV for years, are being shared on Facebook these days
 is video ko dekhakar koi bhi hanse bina nahin rah paaegaa, khaastaur par wo log jinhone film 'hamashakals' or siaidi dekhi he
 In this video, it is shown by gesture that how Sajid has eaten the minds of people by making this film
 film relies hone ke baad se hi logon ne soshal netwarking cites par ise lekar majaak bananaa shuru kar diya tha
 However, the name of the film or serial has not been taken directly in this video
 aap bhi dekhen is video ko: On the fourth day of the winter session of the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly, the CNT-SPT Amendment Bill was passed amidst fierce uproar and chaos
 is dauraan sadan ke bheetar or baahar CNT-SPT sanshodhan vidheyak ke virodh main jabardast hangaamaa hua
 The opposition tore pamphlets of the amendment bill inside the house, while some opposition legislators climbed the table in front of the speaker
 sadan ke bheetar kursiyaan phekane kii koshish kii gayi
 Congress MLA Irfan Ansari sprayed the foam while protesting inside the house
 darasal hangaame kii vajahjharkhandamen lagu sau varsh puraane CNT -SPT act main sanshodhan kaa bill tha
 Where the government was adamant on passing it at any cost
 vahiin vipaksh lagaataar iskaa jabardast virodh kar rahaa tha
 According to the previously announced program, the government introduced this amendment bill in the House today
 vahiin iske pesh hote hi vipaksh ne hangaamaa khadaa kar diya
 Speaker Dinesh Oraon was also attacked from the chair, tore up the copy of the amendment placed before the speaker
 vipakshi vidhayakon kahana tha ki wo ruling party se do-do haath karne ko taiyaar hai, lekin sanshodhan vidheyak pesh nahin hone denge
 What is CNT-SPT Amendment Bill Actually the CNT-SPT Act is a law made for the land of tribals
 beete 3 may ko chotanagpur tenency act or santhal pargana tenency main sanshodhan kaa prastaav jharkhand cabinet kii baithak main paas kiya gaya tha
 Under the amendment of both these provisions, the landowner will get the right to change his land
 krishi ke alaava apni jameen kaa upyog vyavsaayik kaaryon ke liye bhi kar sakenge
 This will also give them business rate, till now tribals could not sell their land to anyone else
 ve bas ek thana kshetra main hi kisi adivasee se jameen kii kharid bikri kar sakate hai
 Under the amendment, the restriction of only the police station will be over
 haalanki jameen maalik kaa malikana haq uski jameen par bana rahegaa
 Earlier there was a provision that Scheduled Tribe land was used for mines and industry and required the approval of the commissioner
 lekin is bill ke paas hone ke baad ab is jameen kaa upyog anya yojana jaise aadharbhoot sanrachana, sadak, urja ke liye transmishan line, parivahan, sanchaar ke liye bhi kiya ja sakegaa
 If Scheduled Tribe land is taken for some work, it will have to be used essentially within five years, if it is not done, the land from which the family is taken will be returned
 saath hi jameen ke evaj main diya gaya muaavja bhi waapas nahin hoga, bill paas hone ke baad mukhyamantri raghuvar das ne kaha ki ham bill par sadan ke bheetar charchaa karana chaahate the lekin vipaksh charchaa ke liye taiyaar hi nahin tha
 In such a situation, BJP was seen celebrating as soon as the bill was passed
 sadak se sadan tak hangamadusri ore sadan ke baahar bhi aaj jamkar hangaamaa hua
 In many places in the city, opposition workers got lathicharge and tear gas was also released
 baharhaal jharkhand main CNT-SPT act ke lagu rahane kii vajah se centre or rajya kii kai badi pariyojnaayen lataki padi he kyonki jameen ke adhigrahan ke dauraan yah act aade aata he
 At the same time, under this law, even the tribals cannot sell the land to people of any other caste, on the other hand banks also shy away from giving loans on such lands
 aise main is bill ke paas hone se iske doorgaami parinaam honge
 While the opposition parties say that after this amendment, the tribals will no longer live anywhere, now their water, forest and land will also be distributed among the capitalists
 gauratlab he ki jharkhand ke kariban sava teen karod kii aabaadi main adivaasiyon kii sankhya kareeb 26 fisadi he, inamen se adhikansh voton par shibu sorain kii party JMM kaa kabja paramparaagat taur par rahaa he
 The Reserve Bank of India has issued a new circular regarding demonetisation
 iske tahat ab pradhanmantri jandhan yojana ke acount holders ke liye ek maheene main cash nikaalane kii seemaa tay kar di gai he
 Now KYC account holders will be able to withdraw Rs 10,000 in a month while non-kyc account holders can withdraw only Rs 5000
 mani londring se bachane ke liye liya faislakisaanon or gramin khataadharakon ke acount kii suraksha or unhen mani londring se bachaane ke liearabiine ye nayaa faisla liya he
 Banks can increase the limit To withdraw 10,000 rupees in a month, the account holders will have to show proper documents to the bank and also explain why they want this amount
 bank manager chaahe to khatadharak kii jarurat ko dekhte hue is seemaa ko 10,000 se zyada kar sakate hai
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has always been seated on the throne of power with the help of coalition, but he has never been tied to the knot of coalition
 unhone bhale hi sarkaar sahyogi party ke saath chalaai ho, par sahyogi party ke saath kadam se kadam milakar har safar tay nahin karte
 In fact, it is a strange coincidence of Nitish's politics that whichever party he is running the government with, he has approved his consent against the President and Vice President candidate of that party
 is baar ke chunaav main hi nahin, balki isse pehle bhi unka itihaas kuch aisa hi rahaa he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has reiterated what he did in the 2012 elections by supporting the ruling and opposition parties respectively in the presidential and vice-presidential elections
 us samay vah aadhikarik rup se vipaksh kaa hissaa the
 Nitish was with the Grand Alliance in the presidential election but the votes of his party JDU voted in favor of NDA candidate Ram Nath Kovind
 jabaki mahaganthbandhan main unki sahyogi party ke netaa lalu prasad yadav se lekar congress netaa gulaami nabi aaazaad tak ne nitish kumaar ko manaane kii koshish kii
 Lalu even went on to say that Ramnath Kovind Sangh is connected, Nitish Kumar should not vote for him and support Bihar's daughter Meera Kumar
 gulaami nabi aaazaad ne bhi kaha ki bihar kii beti kii haar par sabase pehla nirnay nitish kumaar ne liya he
 He said that those who believe in one principle, take a decision
 or jo log kai siddhanton main vishwaas karte hai, wo alag-alag faisle lete hai
 So Nitish Kumar attacked the Congress and said that he is not a hanger of the Congress
 ramnath kovind ke samarthan main kaha tha ki ram kovind bihar ke rajyapal pad par rahete hue bahut acha kaam kiya he
 In the current era, when Nitish Kumar broke ties with the Grand Alliance and joined the NDA camp
 aise main endie ko ummid thi ki uparashtrapati ke chunaav main unke ummidavaar venkaiya naidu kaa nitish samarthan karenge, lekin nitish kumaar ne aisa nahin kiya
 He also introduced his nature to the NDA by declaring his support in favor of UPA candidate Gopal Krishna Gandhi
 ab nitish endie ke saath to hai, lekin uparashtrapati chunaav main unki party upie ummidavaar gopalkrishna gandhi ko vot kar rahi he
 Significantly, Nitish Kumar had repeated some similar history in 2012 as well
 nitish kii party us vakt bhaajapa nit rajg kaa hissaa thi
 Which supported the presidential candidate Pranab Mukherjee
 saath hi uparashtrapati pad ke liye rajg ke jaswant singh kaa samarthan kiya tha
 After that, the distance of Nitish Kumar from BJP started increasing
 uske baad kai muddon par nitish kii raay endie se alag hoti thi
 He broke the alliance in 2013 after Narendra Modi was elected leader for the 2014 general elections

 Plane debris 7 am 30 baje ke aasapaas baraamad kiya gaya
 According to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the gopro camera on the windshield of the aircraft showed that Pilot Singh and the passenger were taking selfies from their mobile phones during the flight before the accident
 haalanki gopro ne vimaan durghatnagrast hone ke vakt kii ghatana ko record nahin kiya
 Investigators have discovered the pilot taking a selfie while carrying passengers above the Front Range Airport 30 miles before Denver in Colorado
 singh kaa vimaan jameen se takreeban 740 foot upar tha
 According to the NTSB, it has been estimated that the cellphone was being used at the time of the accident
 is vajah se payalat kaa dhyaan hat gaya or vimaan se uskaa niyatrann hatane se yah haadasa hua

 China has denied that it plans to mediate between India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir issue due to investment in the china-pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)
 china kaa kahana he ki 50 arab dollar kii sipek pariyojna sekashmiripar uske ruukh main koi badlaav nahin aayaa he or is mudde kaa samaadhaan dwipaksheeya rup se hona chahie

 sattarudh communist party of china ke akhbaar global times main prakashit lekh main yah sanket diya gaya he ki kshetra main badi bhoomika nibhaane main china ke apratyaksh hit hai

 The bridge you are building between generations
 main excilence ke bare main baat karuunga, junun ke bare main baat karuunga, ham kya bananaa chaahate hai, india kaisaa bananaa chahta he
 In the beginning of Mind Rocks, 'space' brought a dream of Rangapa, a dream of my father
 main aapse share karnaa chahta hum
 My parents were athletes
 1972 main papa ne olympic khelaa
 In childhood, Papa had decided that he should make it an athlete
 jab main rang-birange bulabulon ko pakadaney ke liye uchhalata tha to nahin samaj paata tha ki ye abs kii eksrasij he
 When i won the medal in 96 Olympics, my father felt that this medal was the most valuable
 aaj jab jitkar aata hum, to papa sabase baad main milte hai, lekin jab harata hum to sabase pehla phone unka hota he
 From football came tennis side was 8-9 years old and wanted to play football
 12 kaa tha to europe ke junior soker program ke liye select ho gaya tha
 It was then said to go to Europe and play for a club
 jhande or desh pher main mat pado
 i left
 waapas aa gaya
 This decision was difficult
 us vakt aap fan karnaa chaahate hai, explor karnaa chaahate hai
 Then Papa said play tennis
 to ye tay hua ki duniya kii best academy main jaaoongaa
 Will try for a year
 phir tay karuunga
 The day i went to the academy my parents split up
 bhaavnaatmak rup se mushkil tha mere liye
 The first year at the academy was extremely difficult
 academy ke us batch main kul aath log the or main umr main sabase chota tha
 i can't sleep at night
 us vakt tennis zyada popular nahin tha
 The structure was not there
 lekin paanch saal baad junior circuit main top par pahunch gaya
 That wintry evening in Germany was when i was 18 years old
 oktober 1991 main voojaburg main tha, germany main
 The tournament was from the next day
 main raat main court main rukkar practice karnaa chahta tha
 The store keeper gave permission but locked all the doors
 sirf ek khidki khuli chhod di ki agar kuch immergency ho to main vahaan se kudakar bhaag sakuun
 But this did not happen
 us behad sard raat main main akelaa juta rahaa
 i want to tell you what was the spirit
 ye soch thi ki hamen ye chahie or ham hasil karke rahenge
 After that night i won continuously and won the tournament
 uske baad ye silsilaa chal nikal padaa
 But after all this, the only thing that i am most proud of today
 jo main aap tak pahunchaana chahta hum ki agar kolkata kaa ek yang ladkaa ye sab kar saktaa he, to aap bhi kar sakate hai
 Play everything by throwing everything, if you really want something deep
 or ye chahat behad majboot he, to aapako sahi logon, sahi maahaul or sahi sawaalon kaa chunaav karnaa hoga
 The right platform has to be chosen
 aaj main jo kuch hum, apane parivaar, apane saathiyon or coach kii vajah se hum
 With the right team, it is very important to have the right people
 vahi hai jo aapako excilence kii taraf push karte hai, catalist kaa kaam karte hai
 For his people, there can be no greater passion than playing for his flag
 par hameshaa achche din nahin hote, kabhi aap bahut lo hote hai excilence kii is jarney main 
 Then you will have to make your own tricks, some tricks which can bring a sparkle of smile on your face and a freshly decorated confidence in that blur
 agar aap jeet or haar, donon ko handle kar sakate hai, to aaie or jindagi kaa khel kheliye, puure jazbe ke saath, sab kuch jhonkkarpes se sawaal javabakya badalata dikh rahaa he bharat main pichley kuch dashakon main?mordan india main sabase badi cheez he utsaah
 Tennis centers have opened extensively in the last 24 years
 food or fitness ko lekar jaagrukta kai guna badi he
 i congratulate all the youth of the country for this new wave
 aglaa liender, aglaa sachin banane kii ye lalak hamen aage le jaaegi
 The condition of sports has improved even earlier
 kya he jo lagaataar chalane detaa he
 Does not allow to retire rukne nahin detaa?jindagi ke liye junun
 There is no appetite for tennis yet
 5 feet 10 inch kaa hum
 These are not very strong legs for tennis
 ab hamaari team kaam kar rahi he ki kaise isko badla jaae
 So something new happens all the time
 i was coming here
 During the drive, a big film offer has come

 By the way, i want to spend most of the time with my daughter Aiyana
 There is a graphic novel, almost done
 main bhi bahut utsukata ke saath in sabakaa intjaar kar rahaa hum
 Why did Mahesh leave Bhupathi
 hamaare liye ye hameshaa pes-bhupati tha
 what went wrong? Before the London Olympics, there was news that there was not enough of us to play for the country? Mahesh and i stayed together for 9 years
 jab wo college main aayaa to tennis ko lekar shyor nahin tha
 We went to Jakarta in 95 to play together
 singles main vah haar gaya tha
 Was about to go to Muscat
 maine kaha ki ja kyon rahe ho
 Play doubles
 wo bolaa paise nahin he
 Papa is calling
 tab tak main singles main bhi khel rahaa tha
 So there was talk that let's try
 main kisi bhi event main sirf participet karne ke liye nahin jaataa
 So went to work at home
 waapas aae or hamane mahesh ko sin kiya or phir jeetna shuru kiya
 There were skills within us
 jeetne kii bhukh thi
 Last year's Olympic event was a sad day in my life
 raajnneeti ghar nahin kerani chahie khel main 
 When world ranking
 sellection process he
 The benchmark is who can represent the country
 mahesh ko pataa tha ki agar desh ke liye vining peyar he, to vah, main or rohan bopanna hai
 But this did not happen
 maine desh ke liye second olympic medal kaa mauka ganvaa diya
 The country lost
 main athlete ke saath antertainer bhi hum
 If someone spends money and reaches the hall with popcorn, then i have to give my best there too
 main vahaan sabko khush karne ke liye nahin hum
 But i will be honest there too
 vahi chijen karuunga jinka koi matlab ho
 How many trade mills have you broken in your life so far? Oh this is a very funny question
 hammm kul aath mashine tut chuki hai ab tak
 Oh wow, i remember this too

 apni shaareerik kshamta or gati badhaani he, to pesh he ek behad aasaan upaay
 According to a new study, the solution is to see 'red' color
 ‘imoshan’ jarnal ke haalia ank ke mutabik, vaigyanikon ne apane adhyayan main paaya ki insaanon ko jab laal rang dikhaaya jaataa he, to unki pratikriya zyada tej or majboot ho jaati he

 There is such a wave in India that it is difficult to avoid them
 mahamilawat kii mahagiravat tay he
 Modi pointed to SP candidate Azam Khan from Rampur and said, "mayawati today seeks votes for the candidate who calls Babasaheb Ambedkar the land mafia and in the name of the university Occupies the land of Dalit settlements
 yah vahi log hai jo mayawati kaa saddaam hossain jaisaa hashr karne kii baat karte the, jinako ambedkar ko maala pehanaanaa manjuur nahin tha
 Mayawati is seeking votes for him
 ''unhone sapa adhyaksh akhilesh par bhi tanj karte hue kaha, ''kya babua (akhilesh yadav) mulaayam singh ji ko paagalakhaane bhejwaane kii baat kehane vaali mayawati kii us harakat ko bhul gayi? aaj hathi cycle par savaar he or nishane par chaukeedaar he
 The Prime Minister said that if a government is to be formed in Delhi, then 272 seats are required
 jo log 40 siton par chunaav lard rahe hai, kya wo 272 laaenge
 They are dusting your eyes
 ye log satta ke liye apane vot bank ko uske thekedaar banakar ek-duusare ko bech rahe hai

 Modi promised that if his government is formed again at the Center, the condition of five acres or less of agricultural land will be abolished to help the farmers with the grant of six thousand rupees every year
 iske alaava chote kisaanon or khet mazdooron ko 60 saal kii umr ke baad har maheene niyamit pension milegi
 He also said that our government will also decide to give pension to people associated with small scale industries, small workers and small shopkeepers
 isaki ek kadi ke taur par piem shramyogi maandhan yojana shuru bhi kii ja chuki he
 Plans will be expanded further once government is formed
 modi ne kaha ki bhaajapa ne sankalp liya he ki satta main phir aane par vah pehali baar rashtriya vyapaaree ayog banaayegi, taaki aapaki har samasya kaa samay par samaadhaan ho sake
 Apart from this, our government has also pledged to give loans to small entrepreneurs up to Rs 50 lakh without guarantee

" ye babasaheb kaa samvidhan he ki ek chaay vaala bhi pradhanmantri ban saktaa he
 Taking a dig at the opposition parties, including the SP-BSP, the Prime Minister said that Uttar Pradesh has told them in 2014 that development should be done, not political self-interest politics
 modi ne sapa-basapa par hamalaa jari rakhte hue kaha, ''pashchimi uttar pradesh main kaise bahan-betiyon ke saath durvyavhaar hua, kaise logon ko apana ghar, apana kaarobaar chhodana padaa, ye desh ne dekha he
 
 
 When Western UP was burning, innocent people were being killed, then who was going to ignore the voice of its victims? The problems, which have passed over them, are all forgotten

 The business class of Bihar is concerned with the power system of the state and the Bihar Industries Association has clearly stated that there is a need to fix the security environment in the state
 sarkaar ko suzav bhi diya he ki centre sarkaar ke siaiesaf ke tarz par rajya main state industrial security force kaa gathan karnaa behatar hoga
 That means he no longer believed in the state police
 rajya kii kanoon-vyavastha par bihar industries association ke adhyaksh capies kesari ne pichley dinon mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se bhi mulaaqaat kii thi lekin rajya main ek ke baad ek vyavsaaiyon kii hatya ke ke baad saaf lagata he ki sarkaar main inkaa vishwaas kam hua he
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself did not attend the Silver Jubilee celebrations of Bihar Industries Association on Wednesday, but Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar reached Modi and he said that if any incident related to law and order happens, it is natural that the atmosphere is spoiled
 
 susheel modi ne kaha ki ham sab log marmaahat hai or aparaadhiyon ko pakadaney ke liye katibaddh hai lekin bihar main nitish kumaar ke shashan kaal main jab bhi ghatana ghati he to aisa nahin he ki apradhi nahin pakade gaye hai or aparaadhiyon ko sajaa nahin mili he jo bhi ghatana ghati yah durbhagyapurna ghatana he or sarkaar ne ise chunauti ke rup main liya he
 However, Modi claims that according to statistics, the incidence of crime in Bihar has been steadily decreasing during the last 5 years
 hindu devi-devataaon ko lekar bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke rashtriya mahasachiv swami prasad maury kii ore se die gaye vivaadaaspad bayaan kaa maamla ab tool pakadta ja rahaa he
 While the BSP chief Mayawati has brushed aside Maurya's statement, on the other hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded action against Maurya
 bhaajapa ke pradesh pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak ne kaha ki basapa main hindu devi-devataaon par bayaan koi basapa kaa netaa apane man se kaise de saktaa he? The BJP leader said that why BSP chief Mayawati is not taking action against BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya in his own personal opinion and reaction regarding the prayers and worship
 unhone kaha ki haar kii haatasha se jujh rahi basapa ab saamaajik vyavasthaaon par kutharaghaat karne main juty he
 In the by-elections held in the state, the appeal of independent candidates to vote has proved ineffective
 basapa netaa ke bayaan se saamaajik bhavanaaen aahat hui hai
 Earlier, Mayawati issued a statement clearly stating that the party has nothing to do with those who make petty comments on any particular religion
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki maury ke bayaan se party kaa koi vaasta nahin, yah unki nijee raay he
 The BSP chief said, 'the party respects all religions based on the basic principle of secularism of the Indian Constitution, created by Baba Bhimrao Ambedkar and according to its right intentions
 yahaan apane desh main alag-alag dharmon ko maanane vaale sarvasamaj ke logon ke rahan-sahan, shaadi-vivaah, puja-paath va unki samskruti aadi ke taur-tareekon kaa bhi aadar-sammaan karte hue unamem dakhal dene ke khilaaf he
 ' gauratlab he ki maury ne ravivaar ko kaha tha ki shaadiyon main gauri-ganesh kii puja nahin kerani chahie
 This is a conspiracy to mislead Dalits and backward in the Manuvadi system and enslave them from the ruler
 basapa netaa ne yah bhi kaha ki hindu dharm main suar ko varah bhagwaan kahkar sammaan de sakate hai
 The donkey is worshiped as Bhavani, the rat as Ganesh and the owl as Lakshmi's ride, but the Shudra is not respected
 is vivaadit bayaan ko lekar logon main kaaphi gussa he

 baithak ke shuru hone par bochahaa vidhansabha kshetra se jadyu ke navnirvaachit vidhayak ramai ram ne party vidhayak dal ke netaa ke rup main nitish ke naam kaa prastaav rakhaa, jiskaa sursand se navnirvaachit vidhayak shahid ali khan ne samarthan kiya or uske baad anya sabhi vidhayakon ne nitish ke paksh main haath uthaakar unke naam par muhar laga di
 Addressing the meeting, JDU National President Sharad Yadav said that his party's victory in the Bihar Assembly elections was more than expected and said that such efforts were made to implement the ideas of great socialist leaders Ram Manohar Lohia and Karpoori Thakur
 The reason is possible
 jadyu ke pradesh adhyaksh vijay kumaar choudhary ne bataaya ki unki party ke vidhayak dal kii aaj sampann baithak main jadyu ke sabhi navnirvaachit 115 vidhayakon main se adhikansh vidhayak upasthit the or unhone nivartmaan mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko sarvasammati se ek baar phir jadyu vidhayak dal kaa netaa chun liya
 Chaudhary said that two other resolutions have also been passed in the JDU Legislature Party meeting, one related to authorizing party leader Nitish Kumar for nomination of office bearers of the Legislature party
 unhone bataaya duusare prastaav main bihar ke matadaataaon ne mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke netritv main itnaa bada jo vishwaas prakat kiya he
 Therefore, the JDU Legislature Party has expressed its gratitude to the people of the state and has taken a pledge that the people of the state have given us the confidence that we will remain loyal to their faith and Nitish Kumar, their leader of all-round development of the state The steps to be taken will be with him with all honesty
