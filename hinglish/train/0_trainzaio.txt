 desh main pehali baar dilli ke kendriya vidyalayon main pehali kaksha ke daakhile ke liye ek lakh se zyada aavedan mili hai
 But due to the failure to claim the application through computer, the administration work has increased rather than reduced
 ek lakh se adhik aavedandelli ke 65 kendriya vidyalayon main do shifton ko milakar pehali kaksha ke online admician kaa pailet project kaaphi had tak safal hua he
 One lakh 15 thousand 578 applications have been received for the first class
 haalanki kendriya vidhyalay sanghathan kaa yah daawa ki online admician ke baad sabhi vidhyaarthiyon kaa chayan bhi ek vishesh prakaar se taiyaar kiye gaye saftware se hoga, bilkul hi flop ho gaya
 The situation is that now more than one lakh applications are being fully validated by the administration itself and it is taking a lot of time
 vahinkendriya vidhyalayaka daawa he ki online admician puri tarah safal rahaa or isse parents ko bahut raahat mili he
 Central school organization deputy commissioner Santosh Mirdha claimed that the parents had less running time, earlier parents had to run a lot to get admission in these schools
 ve zyada se zyada do-teen skulon main hi aavedan kar pate the lekin is baar unhone das se adhik jagahon par aavedan kiye hai
 The Ministry of Human Resources had announced a pilot project for online admission in Kendriya Vidyalayas in Delhi and plans to implement it in the country based on its success, but the major hurdle is the monitoring of the selection process through computers as many categories in schools Students are selected under ho saktaa he vivadasanghathan ke ek aalaa adhikari ke anusaar computer ke jariye naam aane par vivaad hone kii ashanka he
 This is the reason, this time the selection is being made under the earlier process rather than the computer
 dilli ke kendriya vidyalayon main bhi siton kaa bantwaaraa pehle kii tarah ho rahaa he
 The online admission is over and the list is being released one by one as part of the selection process
 kendriya vidhyalay kaa kahana he ki chayan prakiya bhi computer se shuru ho, iske liye kaam chal rahaa he or koshish yahi he ki agle saal se online admician or chayan deshbhar ke vidyalayon me lagu kiya ja sake
 Currently, the selection process will continue in Delhi till July
 isliye lambii hogi chayan prakriyadilli kii sahaayak ayukta indu kahati hai ki jin parents ne ek se zyada skulon main aavedan kiya he or bachche kaa admician do skulon main aa gaya to aise main jo ek seat khaali hogi wo vatting vaale bacchon ko milegi
 This is the reason that the selection process will go a long way
 philhalaonline prakriyaase ek phayda jarur he ki parents ko ghar baithe bahut se skulon main aavedan kaa mauka mil gaya he or bacchon ke admician ke chance bhi pehle kii tulana main bad gaye hai

 bihar ke purv swasthya mantri or rashtriya janata dal ke netaa tej pratap yadav nav varsh ke pehle din apni maa rabari devi se milane tejasvi yadav ke ghar pahunche hai
 But the special thing is that Lalu Yadav's younger son and Tej Pratap's brother Tejashwi Yadav is not in Patna at this time and he is coming to Delhi
 aishwarya raay se talaak ke baad tej pratap ne rabari devi ke ghar 10 circular road janaa band kar diya he or vah apane nae sarkari bangale main rahete hai
 Tej Pratap said after meeting the mother that mother is with me in my fight
 unhone kaha ki 8 taarikh ko talaak ke maamle main agali sunwaayee he or maa ne kaha he ki vah mere saath hai
 Tej Pratap said that i have no relation with Aishwarya and her family and we have broken the entire relationship
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki aishwarya ke parivaar vaale CID lagaakar meraa pataa lagava rahe hai
 From politics to family matters, there have been reports of estrangement between Tej Pratap and Tejashwi, although both brothers have always denied such things
 lalu yadav ke baad argedy kii kaman tejasvi yadav ke haathon main hai or pichhali gathbandhan sarkaar main chota hone ke baavjood tejasvi yadav ko bihar kaa up mukhyamantri banaaya gaya tha
 Lalu Yadav is serving a jail sentence and in such a situation, many meanings are being extracted from the meeting of his elder son Tej Pratap with Rabri Devi
 vaise, aajkal tej pratap apane janata darbar kii vajah se bhi charchaa main hai
 In Lalu Yadav's style, meeting the general public and listening to their problems is the reason why there has been a lot of discussion in the general circles
 iske baad kayaas yah bhi lagaae ja rahe hai ki tej pratap khud party kaa netritv karnaa chaahate hai
 However, Tej Pratap had denied such speculations in a conversation with Aaj Tak recently
 shaadi ke chah maah baad hi tej pratap ne apni patni aishwarya raay se talaak ke liye aavedan kar diya tha
 He said that he could not live with his wife in suffocation
 tej pratap or aishwarya kii shaadi beete saal 12 may ko patna main hi hui thi
 Efforts were made to convince Tej Pratap on behalf of Aishwarya's family, but the matter could not be reached

 1989 main iaiti khadgpur se maikenical ejineering kii padhai puri karte hi arvind kejariwal ke haath main oengisi se naukari kaa ofer letters aa chukaa tha
 But he insisted - i have to do the job in the same Tata Steel, which rejected the interview
 darasal, tata steel jamshedpur ke saath arvind kejariwal kaa pehla intervyuu niraashaa bharaa tha, unhen tab company ne naukari laayak samajha hi nahin
 Kejriwal was so stubborn that he made a request to the Tata Steel Company headquarters for a second interview
 kaha ki unhen intervyuu kaa bas ek or mauka mil jaae to vah apane aap ko sabit kar denge
 Eventually, the company interviewed him again
 is baar maamla kejariwal ke paksh main gaya or vah tata steel kii najar main naukari laayak tehre
 After training, he became an assistant manager at Tata Steel in Jamshedpur
 magar kuch hi samay main kejariwal manager kii naukari karte hue ub gaye
 Then he felt that he would have to become a civil servant for what he wanted to do
 unke man main civil services kii taiyaari karne kaa khyaal aayaa
 So confident in himself that he even quit the prestigious Tata Steel job for preparation
 yaheen se kejariwal ke sangharshon kii vah patharilii dagar taiyaar hui, jis par chalate hue vah aaj dilli ke mukhyamantri kii kursi tak pahunchane main safal rahe
 Arvind Kejriwal, born on 16 August 1968, how he got out of the engineering field and entered bureaucracy and then climbed the ladder of success in politics
 padhie janmdin par unki raajnneetik yatra ke bare main
 On the one hand, the preparation of civil services was going on; on the other side Kejriwal also used to do social service
 isi dauraan vah madar terresa se mili or unke nirdesan me kalighat ashram main do maheene tak kaam kiya
 Later he also worked with Ram Krishna Mission and Christian Brothers Association
 nehru yuva centre ke saath kejariwal ne gramin ilaakon main samaaj seva se jude kaam kiye
 In the meantime, his continued preparation for civil services paid off and in 1995 he was elected to the Indian Revenue Service (IRS)
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan arvind kejariwal(file photo-fasebuk se)bhrashtachar dekh chhod di sarkari naukriaiares afasar ke taur par arvind kejariwal inakam tex department main kaam karne lage
 Seen that the department has been created to end corruption and catch tax evaders, there has been a loot and robbery
 upree dabaav main afasaron ko galat kaam karne pad rahe hai
 Sports are being done in income tax survey
 yah sab arvind kejariwal kii un kalpanaaon se pare the, jo vah sarkari naukari main aane se pehle samajhate the
 Arvind Kejriwal decided to be active in social service along with a job
 1999 main unhone 'parivartan' naamak sanstha ke jariye bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim shuru kii
 It was from here that Kejriwal began to be recognized as an anti-corruption activist
 1999 main dilli main rashan ghotaale kaa khulaasa kar kejariwal surkhiyon main aa gaye
 While being an IRS officer, he had exposed the scam, hence the discussion was abound
 2006 main jab arvind kejariwal nai dilli main inakam tex ke joint kamishnar the to unhone naukari se istipha de diya
 Now Kejriwal had become a full-timer activist
 desh me paardarshita ke liye artiai act lagu karne ko lekar hue andolan se bhi kejariwal jude rahe
 Kejriwal had burnt copies of the Lokpal prepared by the central government as a jokpal
 (photo-fasebuk se)anna andolan ne dilaai rashtriya pahachaanaiares kii naukari chhodane ke baad ab arvind kejariwal gajiabad ke kaushambi vaale ghar se saamaajik gatividhiyon kaa sanchaalan karne lage
 It was in 2010 when he came close to Gandhian social activist Anna Hazare from Maharashtra
 yah wo vakt tha jab manmohan sarkaar main saamne aae kai bade ghotaalon se janata main naaraazgi thi
 People were looking towards a leadership with hopeful eyes
 kejariwal ne janata kii nabj samay rahete bhaanp lee
 Describing Janlokpal as a great tool to eliminate corruption, he laid the foundation of Janlokpal movement under the leadership of Anna Hazare
 yah andolan india against karpshan binar muhim ke tahat chalaa
 The time of 2011 is known for the Anna movement in the country
 ramlila ke maidan main swatahsfoort rup se desh ke kone-kone se parivartan kii aas main aae hajaaron logon kii bheed kai din or raat tak juty rahi
 This entire movement has been a curiosity and subject of study for political scientists even today
 kaha jaataa he ki andolan kaa cheharaa bhale gandhivadi anna hajaare the, magar iske peeche puri yojana arvind kejariwal kii hi thi
 There have been allegations behind the split in Team Anna Hazare that Arvind Kejriwal had jacked up the movement
 anna hajaare raajnneeti main utarane ke khilaaf the, magar kejariwal ne vikalp kii raajnneeti dene ke liye november 2012 main chand saathiyon ke saath aam aadmi party shuru kii
 It is said that during the meeting held at the house of a senior journalist during the agitation days, Kejriwal had the idea of forming a party in Dilodimag
 party banane ke saath anna hajaare or kejariwal kii raahen juda ho gayi, jo aaj tak phir na jud sakin
 Kejriwal showed charisma in elections
 Aam Aadmi Party showed charisma within a year
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main 28 siton ke saath sabase badi party banakar ubhari
 If the Congress gave support in a strategy if there was no majority, Kejriwal became the Chief Minister for the first time on 28 December 2013
 magar gathbandhan ke kaaran khulkar faisle lene main haath bandhaa dikhaa to kejariwal ne 49 din baad hi istipha de diya
 Then in 2015, Kejriwal did what his own party had not imagined
 70 main se 67 siton jitkar nayaa itihaas rach diya
 Only three seats were won by the BJP, which reached power at the Center in 2014 itself
 arvind kejariwal ne 14 farvari 2015 ko duusari baar mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 He will complete his term in February 2020
 kejariwal se judin kuch baaten-arvind kejariwal 2012 main swaraj naamak pustak likh chuke hai
 In his view, there are ideas about what is the politics of alternative
 -arvind kejariwal ke kareebi kehete hai ki vah sirf chaar ghante hi sote hai
 - Sahpathi says that when he used to spend free time during college days, Kejriwal used to teach children in slums and spend time in other types of social work
 - neshnal academy of administration main iares kii training ke dauraan arvind kejariwal kii dosti bachmet sunita se hui or baad main unhone shaadi kii
 -the Kejriwal couple has a son and a daughter
 -haryana ke sivaani main 16 agast 1968 ko paidaa hone vaale arvind ke pita govind ram kejariwal electrical ejeeniyar the

 There is some relief news for Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 jahaan ek ore patna main jal jamaav ko lekar wo apni hi sahyogi party bijepi ke ek gut ke netaaon kii aalochana kaa saamana kar rahe hai to vahiin ek or sahyogi lok janashakti party ke adhyaksh or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan unke bachaav main aae hai
 Although Paswan did not mention Patna's water logging, he did make a tweet on Saturday saying that as head of state, you (nitish Kumar) have written a new definition of good governance
 darasal ye twit paswan ne nitish kumaar ke ek baar phir janata dal united ke rashtriya adhyaksh chune jane par unhone badhai dene ke liye kiya he
 He praised Janata Dal United for taking it to a new height under his skilled leadership
 nishchit rup se janata dal united ke netaaon ke liye paswan kaa ye twit raahat vaali khabar hai kyonki bijepi ke netaa filhal jal jamaav ke bahaane nitish kumaar par nishaanaa saadhane main koi kasar nahin chhod rahe hai
 The extent was reached when Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that no one speaks when Mumbai also sinks, on which a newly appointed spokesperson of BJP, Nikhil Anand cut his talk and said that water also gets out from there soon
 bijepi netaaon ke bayaan se saaf tha ki wo puure jal jamaav kaa thikra nitish kumaar par phodna chaahate the
 He knows that despite being a BJP minister in the Municipal Development Department, despite the Municipal Corporation being in his possession and all the mlas of the city belong to the BJP, there is nothing left to defend after that

 After that Hafiz Saeed was arrested in the house
 - 2006 main jab mumbai main train main dhamaake hue the or kai log maare gaye the, tab uskaa link hafiz said ke sanghathan se hi judaa tha
 He was then placed under house arrest due to international pressure

 However, each time, due to the weak case, it was left again and again

 But each time Hafiz Saeed is released within a few days

 bhartiya sena manipur main aatankiyon ke khilaaf myanmar sarhad par khufia report ke baad ek oparation ko anjaam dene main juta he
 The operation of the army soldiers of the terrorists is still going on
 philhal kisi aatanki ke maare jane kii khabar nahin he
 The army chief had taken stock of the situation
 On May 25, Army Chief General Dalbir Suhag went to Manipur and took stock of the situation there
 sena ke local cmanderon ko aatankiyon ke khilaaf oparation karne kii yojana ko antim rup diya
 Returning on 26 June, he informed all the matter to the Defense Minister
 oparation ko centre sarkaar kii hari jhandiraksha mantri manohar parrikar ke baad pradhanmantri modi or enese ajit dobhaal ko isaki jaankaree di gai
 And then after getting the green signal from the government, this operation was carried out in Myanmar
 raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne bhi sena ke aatankiyon ke khilaaf is oparation kii pushti kii he
 This is the second time that the army has carried out operations on the Myanmar border against terrorists in Manipur
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv vaali nai centre sarkaar ko bane is hafte ek maheenaa puraa ho jayega
 Along with this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked his ministers and officers to focus on three areas immediately and take action
 vaise sarkaar kii praathamikta bigadi arthvyastha ko patari par laana to he hi, lekin pradhanmantri teen kaamon ko sabase pehle puraa hote hue dekhnaa chaahate hai
 He has instructed the officers to improve relations between the Center and the states, address public grievances and grievances and make available the weapons and equipment required by the army without any delay
 pradhanmantri afasaron ko pehle hi yah nirdesh de chuke hai ki kaaryon main hone vaali deree ko bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 He has said that accountability and capacity should be increased by reducing red tape
 ab vah chaahate hai ki naukarshah unke daftaron main aane vaali shikayaton kaa jald se jald nipataara karen
 Among these, complaints related to flights, train tickets, train travel, telecom, banking, health and pension will be given priority on social media and websites
 iske alaava pradhanmantri karyaalay main ek special cell bhi banaai gai he jo is baat par nigaraanee rakhegi ki samasyaayein kitni jaldi hal ho rahi hai
 The Prime Minister has also decided that he will meet the Army Chiefs at least once a month
 kaayade se acha ye hota ki afasarshahi or raajnneetik netritv ke sawaal par sansthagat rup se bahes hoti lekin aksar in sawaalon ko tamaam cametiyon ke naam se dari ke neeche sarka diya jaataa he
 The reason for the collision is that usually the two keep moving together, but if there is a confrontation at some point, only the way out or the court is visible
 aapane uttar pradesh ke ipies adhikari amitabh thakur ke maamle ko kis nazar se dekha he
 Are you among those who are angry at the injustice done to a whistleblower and courageous officer or are you among those who are apprehensive about Amitabh Thakur's extreme enthusiasm as a government official
 kaise bhi dekhen lekin jis baatcheet ko tepe kar amitabh thakur ne saarvajanik kiya he usase to yahi lagata he ki mulaayam singh yadav ne atikaraman kiya he
 He has threatened to remind us of sympathy
 sudhar jane kii naseehat ke kuch ghante ke baad balaatkaar ke maamle darj karana or nilambit karnaa bataata he ki amitabh thakur ko kya sanket diya ja rahaa tha
 The tone of the conversation is soft, but it is strong
 is baatcheet main mulaayam singh yadav kisi jasrana prasang kii yaad dilaa rahe hai ki waisi haalat ho jaaegi
 In 2006, Amitabh Thakur was attacked in Jasrana by Samajwadi Party MLA Ramvir Singh Yadav and his supporters, later acquitting accused Ramvir and others as several witnesses related to the case were overturned
 isi baatcheet main mulaayam yah bhi kah rahe hai ki aapse hamadardi rahi he
 i went to Patna 
 The housemates said that my boy is there to keep watching
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki netaji hamen bhi daant dete hai
 The difference is that he is the leader of his party and also the father
 lekin ve adhikariyon ke kya hai
 Why was Mulayam Singh Yadav sympathetic and why did he go to Patna Amitabh's house, if there was so much sympathy then why was Amitabh Thakur suspended twice as Mulayam Singh Yadav's Chief Minister
 baatcheet record karnaa or saarvajanik karnaa vivaadaaspad ho saktaa he lekin public nahin hota to pataa kaise chalata ki hamaare rajaneta afasaron se kaise baat karte hai
 Surely Amitabh Thakur went to the police station against Mulayam Singh Yadav to write Tahrir
 police sudhaar par baat karne vaale upi ke purv dijipi prakaash singh kehete hai ki amitabh thakur ko yah nahin karnaa chahie tha
 Amitabh Thakur is a passionate officer
 amitabh or unki patni ne 500 se zyaada artiai aplication jari kiye hai
 His wife Nutan Thakur can do these things with independent status, but Amitabh's activism maintains a new and interesting tradition
 aakhir paune dau sau janhit yachikaayen daayar karne vaale is yugal se prerana lekar pradhanmantri modi yaa kisi anya rajya ke mukhyamantri apane afasaron ko aisa karne ke liye protsaahit karen yaa afasar amitabh se swat prerana lete hue janhit yachikaayen daayar karne lag sakate hai
 By the way, the case of IPS Kuldeep Sharma in Gujarat will be remembered
 sarkaar se unki ladaai chali to unke khilaaf bees saal pehle band ho chuke maamle ko khol diya gaya
 Ashok Khemka of Haryana started fighting corruption in the Transport Department that was transferred
 haryana ke ek or adhikari sanjeev chaturvedi kaa maamla supreme court tak gaya lekin ve kabhi media ke saamne nahin aae
 Ashok Khemka came before the media, but he always outlined his limits
 to kya amitabh thakur, sanjeev chaturvedi or ashok khemka kii tarah eemaandaar hote hue duusari tarah batting karte hai
 It can be debated but even registering a rape case against an IG level officer is nothing less
 ye or baat he ki amitabh thakur or unki patni kii janhit yachikaaon kii jyadatiyon ko dekhte hue elahabaad hai court kii lakhanu bench ne 9 june 2014 ko amitabh thakur kii ek janhit yachika se naaraaz hokar adaalat ne un par bina sarkari anumati ke piiel karne par roak laga di
 Similarly, on 11 April 2014, the angry High Court from a PIL of Nutan Thakur made a condition of depositing Rs 25,000 from the court before the PIL
 tippaniyan Will any government encourage its officers to PIL like Amitabh, participate in picketing demonstrations or set up an independent and personal inquiry commission
 shaayad nahin
 If other governments like this, they can issue such circulars for their officials
 isi tarah upi ke ek or afasar surya pratap singh apane fasebuk pej par rajya sarkaar kii kaaphi aalochana karte rahete hai
 Facebook is his personal space where he keeps on pandering news questioning the government while holding the post of Principal Secretary, Department of Public Enterprises of UP
 surya pratap singh kaa kahana he ki ve janata main chetana paidaa kar rahe hai
 But outside of Facebook, he has also participated in anti-copycat demonstrations
 sarkaar ne es
 P
 singh ko suspend nahin kiya he
 Amitabh Thakur not only fights the government but also fights with his police officers
 agar amitabh thakur police mahakme ke kaayade ko tod rahe hai to sarkaar koun sa nayaa kaayda bana rahi he
 Calling Mulayam Singh Yadav and whatever happened later is professional Qaida
 pichley saadhe teen saal main upi main aath-aath police mahanideshak hue hai
 Amitabh has been active for many years but why was he just targeted
 kya khanan mafia par haath daalane ke kaaran yah sab hua jisase pareshaan sarkaar ne media or andolanon main unki sakriyata kaa bahaanaa banaaya
 How have you seen the case of IPS officer Amitabh Thakur of Uttar Pradesh
 kya aap unamem se he jo ek wheasal blor or saahsee afasar ke saath ho rahi ninsaphi se naaraaz hai yaa aap un logon main se bhi hai jo ek sarkari adhikari ke rup main amitabh thakur ke ati utsaah ko lekar ashankit hai
 Anyway, but the conversation which was taped by Amitabh Thakur made public, it seems that Mulayam Singh Yadav has encroached
 hamadardi kii yaad dilaane ke bahaane dhamkee hi di he
 Registering and suspending rape cases after a few hours of trying to improve shows what was indicated to Amitabh Thakur
 baatcheet kaa lehza zarur naram he magar baat sakht he
 In this conversation, Mulayam Singh Yadav is reminding us of a Jasrana incident that such a situation will happen
 darasal 2006 main jasrana main amitabh thakur par samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak ramvir singh yadav or unke samarthakon ne hamalaa kiya tha, baad main aaropee ramvir or anya logon ko bari kar diya gaya kyonki maamle se jude kai gavaah palat gaye
 In this conversation, Mulayam is also saying that he has been sympathetic to you
 main patna gaya
 
 ghar waalon ne kaha meraa ladkaa he dekhte rahanaa
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said that Netaji also scolds us
 fark ye he ki ve unki party ke netaa hai or pita bhi
 But what are they of the authorities
 mulaayam singh yadav kii kyon hamadardi thi or ve patna amitabh ke ghar kyon gaye, agar itani hamadardi thi to amitabh thakur mulaayam singh yadav ke mukhyamantri rahete hue do baar kyon suspend hue
 Recording and making the conversation public can be controversial but if it is not public then how do we know how our politicians talk to the officers
 zarur amitabh thakur mulaayam singh yadav ke kilaaf thane main taharir likhaane pahunch gaye
 Former UP DGP Prakash Singh, who spoke on police reforms, says Amitabh Thakur should not have done it
 amitabh thakur ek jununee adhikari hai
 Amitabh and his wife have released more than 500 RTI applications
 unki patni nutan thakur swatantra haisiyat se bilkul ye kaam kar sakati hai lekin amitabh kii sakriyata ek nai or rochak parampara to kaayam karti hi he
 After all, taking inspiration from this couple who have filed one hundred and fifty pils, Prime Minister Modi or the Chief Minister of any other state should encourage his officers to do so or the officers may start filing public interest petitions taking inspiration from Amitabh
 vaise gujarat main ipies kuldeep sharma kaa maamla yaad hoga
 When his fight with the government went on, the case against him closed twenty years ago was opened
 haryana ke ashok khemka ne transport vibhaag main bhrashtachar se ladanaa shuru hi kiya tha ki tabadalaa ho gaya
 Another Haryana officer Sanjeev Chaturvedi's case went to the Supreme Court but he never appeared before the media
 ashok khemka media ke saamne zarur aae magar ve hameshaa apni seemaa ko rekhaankit kiya karte the
 So does Amitabh Thakur, like Sanjeev Chaturvedi and Ashok Khemka, be honest and bat the other way
 is par bahes ho sakati he lekin ek aiji str ke afasar ke khilaaf balaatkaar kaa maamla darj karnaa bhi kuch kam zyaadati nahin he
 It is another matter that in view of the excesses of pils filed by Amitabh Thakur and his wife, the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court was angered by a PIL by Amitabh Thakur on 9 June 2014, the court prohibited him from doing PIL without government permission
 Put it isi tarah 11 april 2014 ko nutan thakur kii ek piiel se naaraaz hoicourt ne piiel se pehle unase 25,000 rupee adaalat main jamaa karne kii shart laga di thi
 The comments kya koi bhi sarkaar apane afasar ko amitabh kii tarah piiel karne, dharna pradarshan main shaamil hone yaa swatantra evam vyaktigat jaanch ayog banane ke liye protsaahit karegi
 Probably not
 agar baaki sarkaron ko yah pasand he to apane adhikariyon ke liye aisa circular jari kar sakati hai
 Similarly, another officer of UP, Surya Pratap Singh, continues to criticize the state government on his Facebook page
 fasebuk unka nijee spes he jahaan ve upi ke saarvajanik udhyam vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv pad par rahete hue sarkaar par sawaal khadey karne vaali khabaron ko chaspa karte rahete hai
 Surya Pratap Singh says that he is creating consciousness in public
 lekin fasebuk se baahar ve nakal virdohi pradarshan main bhi hissaa le chuke hai
 Government s

 Singh has not been suspended
 amitabh thakur sirf sarkaar se nahin ladate lekin apni police ke afasaron se bhi lard jate hai
 If Amitabh Thakur is breaking the rules of the police department then what is the new law? mulaayam singh yadav kaa phone karnaa or baad main jo bhi hua kya wo peshewar kaayda he
 In the last three and a half years, there have been eight Director General of Police in UP
 amitabh to kai saal se sakriy hai lekin abhi kyon nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Did all this happen because of the handing over of the mining mafia, which troubled the government as an excuse for their activism in the media and movements
 sudhar jane kii naseehat ke kuch ghante ke baad balaatkaar ke maamle darj karana or nilambit karnaa bataata he ki amitabh thakur ko kya sanket diya ja rahaa tha
 The tone of the conversation is soft, but it is strong
 is baatcheet main mulaayam singh yadav kisi jasrana prasang kii yaad dilaa rahe hai ki waisi haalat ho jaaegi
 In 2006, Amitabh Thakur was attacked in Jasrana by Samajwadi Party MLA Ramvir Singh Yadav and his supporters, later acquitting accused Ramvir and others as several witnesses related to the case were overturned
 isi baatcheet main mulaayam yah bhi kah rahe hai ki aapse hamadardi rahi he
 i went to Patna 
 The housemates said that my boy is there to keep watching
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki netaji hamen bhi daant dete hai
 The difference is that he is the leader of his party and also the father
 lekin ve adhikariyon ke kya hai
 Why was Mulayam Singh Yadav sympathetic and why did he go to Patna Amitabh's house, if there was so much sympathy then why was Amitabh Thakur suspended twice as Mulayam Singh Yadav's Chief Minister
 baatcheet record karnaa or saarvajanik karnaa vivaadaaspad ho saktaa he lekin public nahin hota to pataa kaise chalata ki hamaare rajaneta afasaron se kaise baat karte hai
 Surely Amitabh Thakur went to the police station against Mulayam Singh Yadav to write Tahrir
 police sudhaar par baat karne vaale upi ke purv dijipi prakaash singh kehete hai ki amitabh thakur ko yah nahin karnaa chahie tha
 Amitabh Thakur is a passionate officer
 amitabh or unki patni ne 500 se zyaada artiai aplication jari kiye hai
 His wife Nutan Thakur can do these things with independent status, but Amitabh's activism maintains a new and interesting tradition
 aakhir paune dau sau janhit yachikaayen daayar karne vaale is yugal se prerana lekar pradhanmantri modi yaa kisi anya rajya ke mukhyamantri apane afasaron ko aisa karne ke liye protsaahit karen yaa afasar amitabh se swat prerana lete hue janhit yachikaayen daayar karne lag sakate hai
 By the way, the case of IPS Kuldeep Sharma in Gujarat will be remembered
 sarkaar se unki ladaai chali to unke khilaaf bees saal pehle band ho chuke maamle ko khol diya gaya
 Ashok Khemka of Haryana started fighting corruption in the Transport Department that was transferred

 Ashok Khemka came before the media, but he always outlined his limits

 Similarly, on 11 April 2014, the angry High Court from a PIL of Nutan Thakur made a condition of depositing Rs 25,000 from the court before the PIL

 If other governments like this, they can issue such circulars for their officials

 After all, taking inspiration from this couple who have filed one hundred and fifty pils, Prime Minister Modi or the Chief Minister of any other state should encourage his officers to do so or the officers may start filing public interest petitions taking inspiration from Amitabh

 Respected Mir sir, you have tweeted that 'there will be no meeting between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Narendra Modi in New York, Nawaz Sharif will raise the voice of Kashmiris again this year in UNGA' mir bhai
 You are neither an official of the Pakistan Foreign Department nor a spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office
 lekin aapane mulaaqaat nahin hogi kaa ek tarah se elaan sa kar diya he
 You are a journalist and if you have received this information from your trusted sources, then those sources will not be a small fat officer
 aap bade patrkaar hai or ho saktaa he is jaankaree ke sutara khud nawaz shareef sahab hon
 By the way, their relationship is so close that they shared a joke with the 'rustic woman' about our Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 phir shaayad unke hi nirdesh par aapane apane shabd waapas bhi le liye the
 Then your credibility was questioned whether your earlier statement was correct or the subsequent cleaning
 kair
 The confidence with which you tweeted 'prime Ministers will not meet' seems to be based on the information you received directly from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 unke kisi khaasmakhaas ne bhi agar aisi 'pukhta' jaankaree aapako di he to bhi iske kai myne hai
 Firstly, after the firing on you (we condemn this incident and support the freedom of the press), Mian Saheb stood with you and Jio in the tussle between Jio TV and Pakistani army-isi
 aisa kar unhone bada acha kiya
 But this increased their differences with the army-isi
 to jis miyaan sahab ne jio ke liye ek tarah se apni kursi daanv par laga di, ab unke liye kuch karne kaa vakt he
 So you have used your credibility, your face and your Twitter as a journalist
 aapkaa ye twit pani kii gaharaai maapne kii koshish main chodi gai takneekee tarang lagati he
 But you are a Pakistani journalist, there is no government there that will get any response from the Government of India on your announcement
 aapane beshak ye bhaanpane kii manshaa se twit kiya ho ki dekhte hai, bharat main andarkhaane se is par kya riection aata he, lekin maaf kijiega, bharat kii videsh niti main chaahe jo bhi khamiyaan ho, vah itani uthali nahin he
 Secondly, because of you the gap between army and government widened
 to ab is khai ko paatane kii zimmedaari bhi aap par he
 So, where the first part of the tweet is like an attempt by the first Prime Minister of the US Deputation to take the army-isi into confidence that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will not repeat the 'previous mistake' of meeting PM Modi by attending the swearing-in ceremony
 
 nai dilli aakar unhone kashmir par koi kadaa bayaan nahin diya tha or na hi hurriyat netaaon se mili the
 At the same time, the second part of your tweet seems to be trying to compensate for this 'mistake' of Mian Sabah
 
 
 'nawaz shareef yuangie main is saal phir kashmiriyon kii awaz uthaaenge'
 This tweet was prominently played by many channels in New Delhi
 isse ho saktaa he ki pakistan kii taraf se nakaaratmak signal maan hamaare bhi kai kootnithik purodha 'mulaaqaat nahin to nahin' kaa ravaiya apnaane par jor den
 In such a situation, there will be no modi-sharif meeting and you will also be known as a journalist for the scoop that look, Mir Bhai had already told the week! duusari taraf aapaki sena or iesai main baithe ek varg ko bhi aapkaa yah twit pasand aayaa hoga
 He must have figured out that Mian Saheb came late
 ab ve pakistan kii sena kii ichha ke anusaar hi chalenge, baat kashmir se shuru karenge or kashmir par hi khatm karenge
 In this way the gap between the army and the government will be reduced to a great extent
 ek teesraa pahalu bhi he
 Your tweet is like a first step towards his atonement for the 'sin' committed by Mian Sahab under Prime Minister Modi's swearing-in
 bharat ke is daure ke shandaar faisale ke baad miyaan sahab ko pakistan main haashie par dhakel diya gaya
 Where did they come to show their statesmanship that i am such a powerful PM that i do not listen to the army
 lekin jab gharelu media main fazihat hui, kade sawaal puche gaye to unako laga ki ye kya ho gaya
 Are i really away from the battle of Kashmir? tabhi unhone ek baar phir aapako naashte yaa khaane par bulaayaa hoga
 This time you would have been given this 'information' by not having heard any joke like a 'rustic woman'
 ise aapane apane twit ke maadhmay se rabad kii goli kii tarah chalaaya he
 So that the crowds dispersed to take the chair of Mian Saheb are also dispersed and there is no loss
 aapke liye ye patrakarita hogi
 To my mind this is 'pay back journalism'
 aap bade patrkaar hai
 Recover all of this
 donon pradhanmantri milenge yaa nahin milenge, yah faisla inhen donon ko karne dijie, or donon ke america daure tak intazaar kiijie
 
 
 Two women were brutally murdered in Delhi
 donon mahilaon ke bich nanad-bhabhi kaa rishta tha
 In this case a woman's husband is being suspected of murder
 haalanki, vah abhi faraar he
 Police are investigating the case by sending both the bodies for postmortem
 jaankaree ke mutabik, yah maamla timarpur ke wazirabad ilaake kaa he
 The deceased have been identified as Sonia (24) and Premlata (28)
 premalata sonia ke fuphere bhai kii patni thi
 On the previous day, the bodies of both of them were found lying in Sonia's house
 donon kii hatya chaaku se gardan katkar kii gai he
 Police reached the spot as soon as the matter was reported
 donon shavon ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya
 a blood-stained knife and screwdriver were recovered from the scene

 The case of kissing the minor contestants of the reality show in a wrong way is going on
 ab vivaad main fanse singer papon ke bachaav main miner contestant kaa ek video jari kiya gaya he
 The girl has described Papon as innocent
 bacchee usee reality sho da wais of india kids kaa hissaa he, jisamen papon jaj kii bhoomika main hai
 What is in the video? In the video, the rest of the reality show contestants and their parents are also seen defending Pappon
 sabase pehle miner contestant ne apana paksh rakhaa
 He told, 'we all went to the children and parents Papon Sir for Holi celebrations
 sab log masti, dance kar rahe the or phir ham sab fasebuk par live aae
 Everyone there was watching that Pappon sir did nothing wrong, he kissed me as a child like my father and mother and everybody loves me like this
 aap plis iskaa galat matlab naa samajhie
 Singer Papon's troubles increased, police investigation instructions, Raveena said - another contestant in Arrest Corvideo also defended Papon and said, "I want to say one thing, Papon sir if i didn't even have a mentor and coach
" She would also call him innocent because he is a personality like God
 unhone mujhe ek bhai or ek pita ke rup main guide kiya pyaar kiya
 They can never be wrong thinking
 mujhe behad bura laga ki ek itane achche insaan par itnaa ganda sawaal uthaaya
 Not even once did you ask us children
 'papon par bhadkinfarah khanudhar, bollywood koreographer farah ali khan ne puure maamle par kaha- main papon ko jaanati hum
 He is a good person, but whatever was seen in the video made me uncomfortable
 koi bhi kisi ke bachche ko is tarah se nahin chhu saktaa
 Not only Pappon, these singers were also engaged in sexual harassment, Aroparvina said - Pawn was arrested Karorvina Tandon demanded to arrest Pappon, calling the incident disgusting and shameful
 ravina tandon ne twit kar kaha, ye harakat ghrunit, sharmnaak he
 Papon should be arrested
 ravina ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki bacchee ke parents par pressure daalaa gaya (papon kaa bachaav karne ke liye)
 He also said that it is shameful to see in some TV debates that such an act is being defended
 papon ke saath reality sho ke jajej main shaamil shaan ne ek twit kar bachaav kiya, haalanki kuch der baad unhone apana twit hataa liya
 Please tell that on the whole matter, Papon gave his clarification on Friday
 miner contestant ke parents ne bhi singer kaa bachaav kiya
 Despite this, people are getting angry on social media
 zyaadaatar log papon kii harakat kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 The channel released its own statement & TV also issued a statement saying- We always take care of the safety and well-being of the contestants participating in our shows
 hamane NCPCR ke disha-nirdeshon kaa hameshaa dhyaan rakhaa he or hamaare production house Essel Vision Productions Limited ne NCPCR or duusare kanoonon ke tahat sabhi upayon kaa dhyaan rakhaa he
 We believe in providing a good platform to carry the talent of contestants

 Humayun was a Mughal ruler
 nasiruddin humayun kaa janm 1508 i main hua or 29 disambar 1530 i main agra main 23 saal kii umr main singhaasana par baitha
 Naseeruddin Humayun, son of the first Mughal emperor Babur, has contributed greatly to the foundation of the Mughal Empire
 babar ke 4 bete the jisamen humayun sabase bada tha
 Babur appointed him as his successor
 babar kii mrityu ke pashchaat humayun ne bharat kii rajgaddi sanbhali or rajya kaa bantwaaraa apane bhaaiyon ke bich kar diya, unke sautele bhai kamran mirza ne kabul or lahore kaa shashan le liya
 Kamran went ahead and became a strong opponent of Humayun
 humayun kaa shashan afghanistan, pakistan or uttar bharat ke hisson main rahaa
 In 1533, Humayun established a new city named Dinpanah
 chausa kaa yuddh chausa kaa yuddh bhartiya itihaas main lade gayi mahatvapurn yudhon main se ek he, jo 26 june, 1539 i
 Was fought at the 'chausa' place between Humayun and Sher Shah
 chausa ke yuddh main humayun ne kuch galtiyaan kii or haar gaya
 Defeated due to some of his mistakes
 humayun yuddh kshetra se bhaag niklaa or ek bhishti kaa sahaara lekar kisi tarah ganga nadi paar karke apni jaan bachaai
 The battle of Bilgram took place between Humayun and Sher Shah, the founder of the Sur Empire
 yah yuddh 1540 i
 Fought in bilogram kaa yuddh jeetne ke baad shershah ne humayun ko bharat chhodane ke liye vivash kar diya tha
 After the Bilgram War, Akbar went to Sindh where he led an exiled life

 Humayun fought four big wars: (1) Battle of Deora: - fought in 1531 AD
 (2)chausa kaa yuddh:- 1539 i main ladaa gaya
 (3) Bilgram: - The war of 1540 and Sirhind was fought in 1555 AD

 whatsapp is going to add a new feature to its app
 jo whatsap ke beta varjan main aa saktaa he
 According to online reports, now users will be able to upload photos or videos in their status under this feature
 jo 24 ghante tak dikhataa rahegaa uske baad dikhnaa band ho jayega thik usee tarah jis tarah instagram stories feechar main hota he
 According to reports, the app will be tabbed separately for the new feature of whatsapp, according to the news, getting huge discounts on iphone, ipad and macbook
 jo abhi maujuud general states feechar se alag hoga
 It is being told that this experimental feature, 'status' tab will be given between chat and calls
 reports kii maane to yugers ko is teb main contate ko or behad intresting banane ke liye kai tarah ke editing tuls bhi milenge
 With this, users will also have the freedom to decide who will receive the status in their contact
 lekin states ko post karne ke baad ise menialidilit nahin kiyaja sakegaa
 Jio will soon give its users 6-series mobile number
 If this feature comes, then it will be interesting to see if this feature will be able to compete with Snapchat and Instagram
 vyapam se judi mauton kii fehrist main namrata damor kii maut kaa maamla jaanch ke daayre main to aayaa, lekin jis teji se uske file ko band kiya gaya he vah sawaal khadey karti he
 In fact, the story of Namrata's death starts from the railway line, between the post-mortem report and the corpse buried in the crematorium, so much that the murder turns into a suicide in an instant
 jaraa gaur kiijie to aazaadee ke baad se hindustan ne ghotaale to bahut dekhe, lekin pehali baar ek aisa ghotaalaa hua jo sikkon kii khanak se kahin zyada khun ke dhabbon ke kaaran charchaa main he
 Call it interesting or unfortunate that the scam with which the first complaint was made in 2009, by the time of 2015, more than 45 corpses have been laid and the 'game' of Yamraj is continuing in Shivraj's era
 khaas baat yah ki daur narendra modi kaa bhi he or endie kii sarkaar ke liye vikaas kaa 'shivaraj model' superhit he
 The first picture of the truth of the death of Narmadanmrita through Namrata is of the railway line from where his dead body was found
 duusari tasviir us postmortem report kii he, jisamen namrata kii jaan jane kii vajah saans kaa ruknaa or dam ghutana he or teesri tasviir hatya ko khudakushi main badalane kii theory sabit karne ke liye shamshaan se namrata kaa shav nikaalnaa he
 That is, in 11 months, the police converted the murder of Namrata into suicide and closed the file
 jaraa silsilewar samajhiesaat janvari ko indore se vaaya ujjain bhopal ja rahi narmada express ke driver ne sau meter kii duuri se hi railway trek par pade shav ko dekhakar train roak di
 Informed the station master by phone
 stesan master nepulice ko jaankaridi ki ujjain-maxi railway line ke paas bhirupura kevi pole number 78 / 9-11ke saamne ajhaat shav padaa he
 But in the report prepared by the police, the body was shown on the track via Bhopal Ujjain Indore
 police ne apni report main namrata ko namarda express se kud kar jaan dene kaa zikr kiya
 For this, the ticket for reservation of seat number 3 in S-8 coach of Namarda Express was also shown
 to pehla sawaal ki agar namrata namarda express se kudi bhi to shav indore se bhopal trek ke badale bhopal se indore vaale trek par kaise pahunch gaya?to kya galat he postmortem report?postmortem report kedastavejabatate hai ki shav namrata kaa he isaki jaankaree kisi ko nahin thi
 That is why the post-mortem of the unknown body was done which was prepared by three experienced doctors Bibi Purohit, OP Gupta and Anita Joshi
 is report main baqayda hoton ke dabane
 The three nail marks on the nose were mentioned by drawing a picture
 or to or maut kaa kaaran dam ghutane or smoothring yani naak, munh, galaa dabaanaa bataaya gaya
 The postmarptum report clearly stated that the death occurred due to breathlessness
 to doosraa sawaal yahi ki jab postmortem report ne hi khudakushi se inkaar kar diya to police ne kis theory ke tahat hatya ko khudakushi main tabdeel kar diya
 The third picture made of the new report is of Kirthpur Shamshan Ghat, from where the police extracted the body of Namrata on 29 January 2012 after 20 days
 kyonki tab tak uske parivaar waalon ne ajhaat shav ke police thane main lage poster se pahachaanaa or uske baad police ne jatke main tay kiya ki postmortem ke alaave bhi duusari raay lee jaae to bhopal main medicoligal institute ke diarector dies badukar ko 7 farvari 2012 ko medical jaanch ke liye bheja gaya
 Dr
 badukar ne 30 march 2012 ko police ko apni 25 pej kii report saunpi
 In this, Namrata's death was declared a suicide
 police ne bhi postmortem kii jagah modikaligal institute ke diarector badurakar kii report ko hi apni file band karne kaa aadhaar banaaya or 28 disbanr 2012 ko yah kahkar file band kar di gai ki maut hatya nahin khudakushi thi
 E-visas will be available to tourists from 43 countries including Russia, Ukraine, USA, Israel and Palestine from today
 ye i-vija kya he or ise paane kii prakriya kya he, aaie jaanate hai
 
 
 There will hardly be any Indian on micro-blogging website Twitter who would not know the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj
 
 
 twitor par sabase zyaada pasand kiye jane vaale logon main shumaar hone ke peeche sushamaa swaraj kaa 'sabaki madad karne vaala' swabhaav he, jisane unhen 'musiibat main yaad kiya ja sakane vaala' shaks bana diya he
 
 
 So any person blocked from the Twitter account of a leader with such an image would be grieved
 
 
 aise kuch log hai, jinke bare main hamen haal hi main pataa chalaa, or aise log ab tak kuch kar nahin pate the, apana dukhada kisi ke saamne ro nahin sakate the, lekin ab unhen ek aisa pej mil gaya, jahaan se unhen ummid hui ki apil karne par shaayad unhen anblock karvaa diya jayega
 
 
 The comments so, apni takalif bayaan karne ke liye block kiye gaye aise logon ne videshmantri ke purv governor pati swaraj kaushal ko chunaa, or unhen apni pareshaani bataai, lekin is kavayad kaa sabase dilachasp pahalu yah rahaa ki isse kuch or saamne aayaa ho yaa na aayaa ho, duniya ke saamne itnaa zarur aayaa ki swaraj kaushal kaa 'sens of humar' kisi kadar bhi apni patni se kam nahin he
 
 
 Swaraj Kaushal is promptly replying to all those who have requested her husband to unblock the account of the External Affairs Minister, and people are happy reading them
 
 
 darasal, kissa somvaar raat ko shuru hua tha, jab ek shaks ne likhaa ki videshmantri ne unhen block kar diya he, to purv governor ne likhaa, "oh
 
 
 My wife blocked you
 
 
 ab aapako follow karne ke liye main unase maafee maagunga
 
 
 " Oh ! My wife has blocked you ? i will apologise to her for following you
 https: / / t

 And perhaps it was this tweet, which raised hopes in the minds of the 'blocked' people, and Swaraj Kaushal started getting requests to get unblocked one by one
 
 
 khayr, bina der kiye unhone bhi ek ke baad ek jawaab, jo har baar pehle se zyaada dilachasp hota chalaa gaya, dena jari rakhaa

 co / idayntgfm0 — Governor Swaraj (@governorswaraj) December 20, 2016 So, such blocked people chose Swaraj Kaushal, former Governor of External Affairs Minister, to tell their problems, and told them their problems, but the most interesting aspect of this exercise is whether anything else has come out or not
 , The world has definitely come to know that Swaraj Kaushal's 'sense of Humor' is no less than his wife
 
 
 jin logon ne videshmantri ke account se anblock kiye jane kaa anurodh unke pati se kiya he, un sabhi ko swaraj kaushal tatparta se puri haazirajavaabi ke saath jawaab de rahe hai, or log unhen pard-padhakar aanandit ho rahe hai
 
 
 Actually, the story started on Monday night, when a man wrote that the foreign minister had blocked him, the former governor wrote, "oh
 
 
 meri patni ne aapako block kiya tha
 
 
 Now i will apologize for following you
 
 
 " Oh! My wife has blocked you? i will apologize to her for following you

 The ruling Narendra Modi government at the Center is at the last stage of its tenure
 agle kuch maheenon main aam chunaavon kaa bigul bajane vaala he
 The Modi government was sworn in on 26 May 2014
 may 2019 main nai sarkaar kaa gathan hona he
 For this, the Modi government has announced its new slogan
 saaf niyat sahi vikaas, 2019 main phir modi sarkaar
 In such a situation, the important question before the people of the country is whether Congress President Rahul Gandhi has more popularity than Prime Minister Narendra Modi before the voting of general elections in 2019? Is Rahul Gandhi a strong contender for the post of Prime Minister in the upcoming elections? Significantly, in the politics of the country eight years ago, the popularity of Rahul Gandhi as a prime ministerial candidate was more than the then Chief Minister of a state, Narendra Modi
 vahiin narendra modi ke ird-gird vivaad bhi gahare the
 However, one reason for this was the presence of Lal Krishna Advani from BJP in the race for the post of Prime Minister
 lekin jab party ke andar modi ke naam par aam raay bananaa shuru hui to ve na sirf laal krishna adwani ko peeche chhodane main safal hue balki lokapriyata main rahul gandhi ko bhi milon peeche chhod gaye
 By January 2014, Narendra Modi became the first choice of the entire country as Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi could not even reach him till the elections
 modi ko kisi mili thi iconomi? chidambaram ke aakhri bajet main chhipi he sachchaib jab aam chunaav 2019 kaa bigul bajane ja rahaa he rahul gandhi ne lokapriyata ke maamle main narendra modi se faasale ko kam kar liya he
 However, it is not as if Narendra Modi is lagging behind in this race
 haa yah jarur he ki rahul gandhi kii sweekaaryata main ijapha ho rahaa he
 Along with this, there is also the question whether anti-incumbency is also working against Narendra Modi
 sawaal yah bhi ki kya rahul gandhi pradhanmantri pad kii is daud main narendra modi ko peeche chhod paaenge?desh kaa sabase vishwasaneey news channel ajtak ek baar phir aa rahaa he mood of da nesan yani desh kaa mizaaj ke saath
 Aaj Tak reached thousands of people across the country with many such questions, whose answers you would like to know in this election Mahakumbh
 aisa hi ek sawaal mood of da nesan survey main poocha gaya
 Has JDU leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar reached the floor with haste in the race for the post of Prime Minister? In several political surveys conducted during the last five years, it was found that during 2016-17, Nitish Kumar was ahead in the race for the next Prime Minister of the country
 Were
 haalanki vah lagaataar rahul gandhi se peeche rahe lekin tisare paaydaan par unki moujdugi unhen daud se baahar nahin rakh rahi thi
 But as soon as Nitish left Lalu Prasad Yadav at the end of 2017, his popularity got tarnished
 is sawaal par bhi jaane kya kahata he ajtak kaa mood of da nesan 2019
 In Mood of the Nation, Aaj Tak also wanted to know who has been the most popular Prime Minister of the country till now? When asked this question in the last almost a decade, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has been at the top and on a few occasions she has been seen below this rank
 'mood of di nesan' aapako batayega kya pradhanmantri narendra modi ke pehle kaarykaal ke baad unhen itani lokapriyata mil chuki he ki vah indira gandhi ko pachhaadne kii sthiti main hai? kya indira ko pachhad modi desh ke sabase lokapriy pradhanmantri banane ja rahe hai? vahiin deshbhar kii raay main in do shakhsiyaton ke saapeksh purv pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru, atal bihari vaajapeyi or rajeev gandhi lokapriyata kii daud main kahaan khadey hai? After the article of Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha in the Atal government, opposition parties are attacking all-round on the Modi government
 congress ne aaj press conferes kar arthvyavastha ko lekar sarkaar par tikhe waar kiye
 Congress leader and former finance minister p Chidambaram said, "the mirror of truth that Yashwant Sinha showed to the Modi government, the Congress is showing every day
" udyog thap hai, naukariyaan bhi nahin he or log pareshaan ho rahe hai
 The whole country is suffering the brunt of messing up of the economy by the BJP
 "unhone aage kaha ki, "notebandi or jiesti kaa bhaar ab janata ke kandhon par aa gira he
 GDP slipped continuously 9 in the last 6 quarter
 2 se 5
 7 percent has fallen
 puraane aankadon se dekhen to jidipi dar 3
 Is only at 5 percent
 bhaajapa shashan main jidipi main niryaat kaa hissaa 19
 4 percent, the lowest in the last 14 years
 "nijee nivesh ke bare main chidambaram ne kaha ki nijee nivesh main koi vruddhi nahin he
 26 in percentage of 'gross fixed capital formation' GDP
 9% he, jo kii 14 saalon main sabase kam he
 PM is misleading the country by running a magic of false propaganda and advertisements
 mek in india kaa haal behaal he
 Production is the lowest in 8 years
 mahangaai or atyadhik karon ne logon kii jeb kaat lee he, rozaana bachat kii yojanaon par byaaj kam kar bhaajapa janata kaa utpeedan kar rahi he
 The BJP is busy making profiteering by reducing tax on petrol, diesel and subsidy on cooking gas
 isse 2,67,000 karod sarkari khajaane main aa chuke he
 To make a profit by robbing the common citizen and filling the government treasury with the money earned from their hard work, bjp's policy has become more intent
 sushamaa swaraj soshal media or khaskar ke twitor par sabase zyada active rahane vaale endie sarkaar ke mantriyon main se ek hai
 Apart from helping people on the Twitter platform, he is also famous for his brilliant spot response

 It was written in the tweet, 'south Korean company sold it to the refrigerator, it is not ready to replace it, they are forcing me to get it repaired'
 is par sushamaa swaraj ne jawaab dete hue likhaa tha 'brother, main refricrator ke maamle main aapaki madad nahin kar sakati, main musiibat main fanse logon kii madad karne main biji hum

 If someone does such an act (throwing stones) with a separatist mindset, he will get an answer
 nakvi nepidipi ke netavikramaditya singh ke kathan par bhi jawaab diya
 Vikramaditya Singh had said that it is the failure of the central government due to which such conditions are prevailing in the valley today

 It will deal strictly with the stone-pelters: Pakistan's stone is left in the minds of those stone-pelting people

 He is misleading such people
 isliye is baat ko samajhnaa chahie ham aman ke paksh main he

 Samsung Galaxy S8 launch ho chukaa he or 21 april se isaki bikri shuru hogi
 The company has given many special features in it, one of which is its facial recognition feature
 is feechar ke tahat yujar ke chehre ko scan karke yah smartphone analock hoga
 But it has been distinguished from lock system quite easily
 iske baad se samsung ke is security feechar par sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 Video has surfaced on the Internet in which the photo was unlocked by placing a photo in front of the Galaxy S8
 yani jis shaks kaa cheharaa scan karke facial ricognishan lock kiya gaya tha, uski photo saamne rakhane se phone analock ho gaya
 After the failure of the Galaxy Note7, the Galaxy S8 is no less a test for Samsung
 aise main jab Galaxy S8 main aisi chook dekhne ko milegi to sambhav he yugers ko kuch niraashaa to jarur hogi
 If there is truth in the video, then obviously it will be a big challenge for Samsung
 kyonki lonching ke samay samsung ne ise sicyor or sef bataaya tha
 idevicehelp has released Demonstration Video in which the photo is placed in the smartphone in front of the front camera
 do se teen tri main Galaxy S8 analock ho gaya
 Although Samsung has assumed that Facial Recognition is not a security feature, but it has been given as a Sline Unlock on the home screen
 company ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha he, ‘facial ricognishan phone analock karne kaa simple tarika he vaise hi daise swip tu analock feechar hota he’company ke mutabik Galaxy S8 main majboot security ke liye fingerprint or Iris scinar die gaye hai

 asurakshit yon sambandhon se hone vaali beemaari echivi aids bharat ke liye badi chunauti he, lekin isse nipatane kaa modi sarkaar kaa plan thodaa alag he
 Union Health Minister Drs
 harshavardhan kaa kahana he ki is beemaari se paar paane ke liye sarkaar ko condom ke istemaal ko badhaava dene ke bajaay bhartiya samskruti ke prachaar-prasar par jor dena chahie
 In an interview to US newspaper 'the New York Times', the Health Minister has given rise to a possible controversy by saying this
 unhone kaha ki vah chahenge ki echivi-aids par kaabo paane ke liye 'pati-patni ke bich eemaandaar shaareerik sambandhon' ko badhaava diya jaae, jo 'bhartiya samskruti kaa hissaa he
 "the wrong message goes with the promotion of condoms" While talking about the disease, the Health Minister left the fold of scientificism and started teaching 'morality'
 america akhbaar se harshavardhan ne kaha, 'condom ke istemaal kaa prachaar karne se galat sandesh jaataa he or iske istemaal se banaaya jane vaala har tarah kaa sambandh jaij lagane lagata he
 Therefore, the emphasis on AIDS campaign should not be just on the use of condoms
 ' yaad rahe ki harshavardhan khud ianti (naak-kaan-galaa) ke doctor hai or dilli main privet practice karte hai
 But Minister, campaigning has yielded good results! According to the American newspaper, this telephonic interview was done last week
 gauratlab he ki 1986 main bharat main echivi-aids kaa pehla maamla saamne aayaa tha
 At one time, it was feared that it would take an epidemic here like in Africa
 1992 main isse nipatane ke liye neshnal aids control organijeshan banaai gai
 The organization campaigned extensively for the use of condoms and safe needles and also saw a meaningful impact
 21 lakh log hai HIV kii chapet mensanstha ke pramukh subbaraaj kehete hai ki hai risk samoohon main condom ke istemaal kaa prachaar rokna thik nahin hoga
 He said, 'we cannot teach morality lessons to people belonging to the hypersensitive group
 'bharat main aids rokthaam ke kaam main sarkaar or sanyukt raashtra ikaayiyon se puraa samarthan miltaa he
 According to a NACO report, from 2000 to 2011, the number of new HIV infections has decreased by 57%
 haalanki echivi sankramit logon kii sankhya ke lihaaj se bharat ab bhi duniya main tisare number par he
 About 21 lakh people are affected by HIV here
 pashchim bengal ke malda main hue dohare rail haadase main kam se kam 50 log ghayal hai, lekin mauton ke aankade par asamanjas barkaraar he
 The local administration is referring to 3 deaths, while according to the railways, only one death occurred
 fark is baat ko lekar bhi he ki pehle haadase ke baad doosraa haadasa kaise hua
 Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi has said that strict action will be taken against whosoever may be found behind this accident, irrespective of the level of officer or employee
 haadase kii vajah se haavda-malda root par rukaawat bani hui he, jiske chalate is raste jane vaali duusari gadiyon par bhi asar padaa he
 The Kanchenjunga Express from Guwahati to New Jalpaiguri is run by another route, while both Intercity Express Up and Dowse running between Howrah and Malda have been canceled
 railway kii maane to pehle 12510 guwahati-bangalore express gaur malda or jameerghata steshnon ke bich durghatnagrast hui
 The train engine and 8 bogies derailed
 2 parcel vine, 1 lagez vine, 3 sleeper bogiyaan, ek asi 3 bogi or ek pentry car
 After this, on the other side, 53027 azimganj-malda Passenger arrived and the accident occurred
 ajeeb baat yah he ki ek hi haadase ke bare main do alag baaten kahi ja rahi hai
 According to the Chairman of the Railway Board, if the attempt is made to understand the accident, then the picture is made in this way
 guwahati bangalore express malda stesan paar karne ke baad direl ho jaati he
 On the other hand, the azimganj-malda passenger train arrives
 driver immergency brake lagaataa he, phir bhi rukate-rukate paisanger train ke dabbe, direl hui bogiyon se ragad kha jate hai
 About this, the DM of Malda is saying about the accident that there has been a face-to-face collision
 guwahati-bangalore express or azimganj paisanger kii takkar main 1 bogi puri tarah tabah ho gai he
 This statement of the DM of Malda regarding the railway accident is completely opposite to the statement of the railway
 guwahati-bangalore express ke direl hone kii baat to dm ne bhi maani, lekin unke mutabik, duusari taraf se aane vaali paisanger train, direl hui express gaadi se aamane-saamne takaraai
 Whatever the reason, the fact is that there has been a flood of accidents on the railway tracks
 ganimat ye rahi ki haadasa malda shahar ke nazadik hua
 The injured received medical help in a hurry, though many of the injured are reported to be critical

 He later tweeted that he meant that the party would contest elections under Manoj Tiwari's leadership and win

 They are tumbling and tweeting, "hopefully Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah will now know that Kath's hand does not climb again and again

 But according to information received from Raj Bhavan, Saryu Rai has not resigned from the Jharkhand Council of Ministers till now
 rajpal ko kisi bhi madhyam se sarayu raay kaa istipha nahin mila he
 On the other hand, if a source close to Saryu Rai is considered, the resignation has been sent to the Governor
 ve kah rahe hai ki sarayu raay ne apana istipha rajyapal ko fax karne ke saath hi media main ise saarvajanik bhi kar diya he
 Actually, by counting the technical aspects, these people are not dismissing Saryu Rai because the elections are still going on and with such dismissal Saryu Rai can become a hero and BJP will be defeated
 ’’ khabar yah bhi he ki fax yaa i-mail se bheja gaya istipha rajyapal sweekaar nahin karata
 There are also reports that Saryu Rai himself or herself wants to remain a member of the party for the moment? But Saryu Rai denied this
 unhone haal hi main india today se baatcheet ke dauraan kaha bhi tha ki ab unki jeet ho yaa haar, ve kisi bhi haalat main party dobaaraa jwai nahin karenge
 On the other hand, according to the sources, according to the party rules, when a member of the party contests against any candidate of the party, he is automatically suspended
 ’’ sarayu raay ne rajyapal ko istipha fax kar diya he baavjood iske unka istipha sweekaar nahin kiya gaya kyon? khabaron kii maane to ‘‘asal main mukhyamantri raghubar das ji chunaav main vyast hai

 'jumla was part of a speech by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 ye baat narendra modi ko is kadar bha gai ki ise unke chunavi abhiyaan kaa hissaa bana diya gaya
 Another example is - a proposal by Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal netaaon ke viipi culture khatm karne ke bade pairokaar rahe hai
 'there will be no red lights on the AAP leaders' car - it was Kejriwal's initiative

 kya he nayaa prastaavparivahan mantri gadakari kaa prastaav he ki laal batti kii suvidha raashtrapati, uparashtrapati, pradhanmantri, supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish or loksabhaa ke spikar ko hi di jaae, jabaki rajyon main ye mukhyamantri, rajyapal, hycourt ke mukhya nyaayadhish or vidhansabha ke spikar ke liye hi ho
 Ganakari has sent this proposal to several ministers including Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj for the opinion
 laal batti kaa statesambar, 2013 ke supreme court ke aadesh ke anusaar sanvaidhanik padon par jo log hai ve hi laal batti laga sakate hai, lekin ve syran nahin baja sakate
 The right to place sirens and lights is only for those who are involved in the emergency - the army, police, fire brigade and ambulances
 haalanki, hidaayat ye he ki syran bahut mild hona chahie
 It should not be very fast at all - people should not have any problem with that
 koun koun laga saktaa he laal batti:centre main raashtrapati, pradhanmantri kii tarah rajyon main bhi unke samakaksh sanvaidhanik padon vaale vishisht vyaktiyon, jaise rajyapal, mukhyamantri ko bhi laal batti ke istemaal kaa praavdhaan he
 With Flasher: President, Vice President, Prime Minister, Former President, Former Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Chief Justice and Supreme Court Judge, Lok Sabha Speaker, Union Cabinet Minister, Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission [modi government replaces Planning Commission NITI Aayog ], Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
 flashar ke bagaiyr:mukhya chunaav ayukta, kendriya rajya mantri or up-mantri, lok sabha upaadhyaksh, rajya sabha ke up-sabhapati, yojana ayog ke sadsy [yojana ayog ab astitv main nahin he, atorni general, cabinet sachiv, sevaaon ke pramukh or paden chif of staff, cat, upiessi, minurity kamishan or essi-asti kamishan ke adhyaksh
 Some special instructions: In case the vehicle is not used by VIP, the red light should be covered with black cover
 niyam ye he ki laal batti kaa istemaal sirf aadhikarik kaamon ke liye yatra ke dauraan kiya ja saktaa he, na ki nijee safar ke dauraan
 That is, if the person authorized for the red light is going to meet a relative or somewhere to go for lunch or dinner, then in that case the red light should be covered by the cover

 aap bhale hi lafjon main bayaan karen yaa na karen, lekin apane partner ke saath aap kis tarah sote hai usase aapke rishte kii gaharaai pataa chalati he
 It is evident that each couple has a unique style of gold
 aapako jaanakar achambha hoga ki har pojishan kaa ek matlab hota he
 So now consider what style your partner likes, and based on that, know the importance of relationship in your partner's mind
 is pojishan main ek shaks peeth ke bal sidhe munh sota he
 And the other partner sleeps with the first one on his chest
 apane partner ke kandhe yaa seene par sar rakhkar sone se ek duusare par nirbharta pataa chalati he
 This style shows emotional dependency for each other
 is pojishan main ek shaks kisi bhi ek taraf karavat lekar sota he, or uskaa partner peeche se usee karavat kii disha main use gale se lagaakar sota he
 Usually, this position is quite common at the beginning of the relationship
 peeche se gale lagaakar letne vaala partner aamtaur par zyada pyaar karne vaala hota he
 This position represents the most close at the beginning of the relationship
 isamen ek partner peeth ke bal sidhi mudra main sota he, or doosraa uske upar aakar gale lagaakar sota he
 This is quite an intimate position and is the best way to make love
 ye style puraani ho chuki jodiyon main adhik paaya jaataa he
 Both partners sleep back on each other or on different sides
 iskaa pyaar kii kami se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Rather, it reflects the mindset that both partners are seeking self-sufficiency somewhere
 ye pojishan aisi lagati he maanon haath or pair ke bal par do shariron ko ganth baandhakar jod diya gaya ho
 In this situation, if the partners break up soon, then they are looking for self-dependency somewhere
 or agar aisa na ho, to samajhie ki pyaar bahut gaharaa he

 (input-ians) congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra varanasi se piem modi ke khilaaf chunaav lard sakati hai
 NDTV has received reports quoting a source that Priyanka Gandhi is likely to contest elections against PM Modi from Varanasi
 varanasi loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladane ke liye namakan kii aakhri taarikh 29 april he
 a source close to the Congress told NDTV that Priyanka Gandhi has agreed to contest elections from Varanasi, but Rahul Gandhi has to take the final decision
 haalanki, isse pehle rahul gandhi ne yah sanket diya tha ki ham is maamle main aapako thodaa suspence main rakhana chaahate hai
 The suspense seems to be over
 itnaa hi nahin, priyanka gandhi ko piem modi ke saath do-do haath karne se koi parhez nahin he
 Priyanka does not even care about the consequences of Varanasi
 congress kaaryakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki jab se priyanka ko purvi uttar pradesh kaa prabhaar diya gaya he, tab se congress kaaryakartaaon main jabardast utsaah he or yadi varanasi se priyanka gandhi chunaav ladati hai to puure purvi uttar pradesh par iskaa asar padegaa
 The Congress is hopeful that Priyanka's contesting elections will also bring out the Congress who have sat in their homes
 priyanka gandhi se jab bhi chunaav ladane ke bare main poocha gaya unhone kaha ki vah har tarah se taiyaar hai
 Even on Sunday when he was asked to contest elections from Varanasi, he said that if the party says, i am ready
 isse pehle bhi priyanka ke chunaav ladane kii baat uth chuki he, magar tab naam raibareli seat kaa aa rahaa tha
 It was being said that if Sonia does not recover, then Priyanka will fight with Rae Bareli
 magar ab sonia gandhi raibareli se parchaa bhar chuki hai
 Recently, when Priyanka Gandhi was asked if she would contest against PM Modi in Varanasi, she said, i have consistently said that i will do what the party asks me to do
 agar congress adhyaksh unhen chunaav ladane ko kahenge to vah ladengi
 When Rahul Gandhi was asked a direct question whether his sister Priyanka Gandhi would contest from Varanasi, he replied, 'you guess yourself
 andaja hameshaa galat nahin hota
 When Rahul Gandhi was again asked if you are not denying this, he said, 'I am neither confirming nor denying this
 'iske baad bhoomihaar 1 lakh 25 hazaar, rajput 1 lakh, patel 2 lakh, chaurasia 80 hazaar, dalit 80 hazaar or anya pichhadi jatiyaan 70 hazaar hai
 If their votes are a little too much, then the mathematics of the seat can change
 aankadon ke is khel ko dekhne ke baad agar saajhedaari par baat bani or jaateey sameekaran ne saath diya to priyanka gandhi modi ko takkar de sakati hai
 However, the way Modi has done development work in Varanasi in the last four and a half years can be ignored, it is also a big question in itself
 lekin agar priyanka varanasi se chunaav ladati hai to haar jeet se pehle congress uttar pradesh main ek bada sandesh main kaamyaab ho jaaegi

 gujarat vidhansabha ke navnirvaachit 182 vidhayakon main se 47 par aapraadhik maamle darj hai or kareeb 141 vidhayak karodpati hai
 The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), an organization working for democratic reform, has analyzed this by analyzing the electoral affidavits of legislators

 hindu dharm main puja upasna kii tamaam paddatiyaan prachlit hai
 In this, both real and formless are worshiped
 saakaar ishwar kii upasna main murti puja kaa vishesh mahatv bataaya gaya he
 The worship of the realizing Brahm cannot be without an idol or symbol
 aaie jaanate hai aakhir hindu dharm main murti puja kab se prachlan main hai or puja ke liye kis tarah kii murti kaa chayan karnaa chahie
 How long has the idol been in vogue in Hinduism - there is no evidence of idol worship after Vedic period
 haalanki mahabharat main indra kaa ullekh jarur kiya jaataa he
 The earliest evidence of the statue of Pashupati is found in the excavation of Harappa
 iske baad suvidha or samarthan ke kaaran, murti puja teji se prachlit hoti gai
 What is the need of idol worship - a person's mind is very fickle and negative
 man ko ekagra karne ke liye kisi aadhaar kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or apane aapako jodne tathaa ekaagratha ke liye murti kaa prayog hota he
 Idol worship makes things a little easier and emotional
 kis prakaar karen murti kaa chunaav ?- ghar main puja ke liye choti murti kaa prayog karen
 - It will be better if it is up to six inches
 - devi devtaa kii murti agar aashirwad kii mudra main ho to uttam hota he
 - The idol should be properly made and should be beautiful
 -yuddh kii mudra yaa nidra kii mudra kii murtiyon kaa prayog na karen
 Take these precautions before bringing the idol in the house - If the idols are of clay, it is good
 -jab murtiyon puraani ho jaaen yaa rup kharaab ho jaae to unka visarjan karren
 - Instead of immersion in rivers, idols can also be pressed into the soil
 -murti puja ko antim puja na maane

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kuch karte hai to uske peeche zarur koi uddeshy hota hai
 He himself confided this on Monday
 unhone kaha ki jab ve purv kendriya vitt mantri pi chidambaram ko rajgir se patna ke sadakat ashram chhodane gaye the to unhen ummid thi ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja mil jayega
 On Monday, when Nitish Kumar was asked that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised special state status to Bihar and Nitish has also been most vocal on this issue, he said that this is the first all-party demand
 is sambandh main vidhansabha se prastaav bhi paarit ho chukaa he
 However, Nitish also said that in 2013, when the then Union Finance Minister p Chidambaram came to Rajgir, he brought him in his car when his chopper broke down
 unhen ummid thi ki vishesh rajya kaa darja mil jayega
 But at that time the committee which was formed on this issue hung it
 nitish kaa kahana tha ki agar upie sarkaar chaahati to bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja de sakati thi
 It is clear from Nitish's answer that he does not want to give too much attention to this issue at the moment
 haalanki bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke purv ve pradhanmantri narendra modi par hameshaa vyangy karte the ki apane vaade ko puraa karo

 Due to non-fixation of seat sharing formula between BJP and AJSU, both the parties will now beat the electoral fronts separately
 haalanki abhi tak donon dalon main se kisi ne bhi isaki aupchaarik ghoshnaa nahin kii he
 However, BJP has made it clear that the demand for AJSU is increasing everyday, which is impossible to fulfill
 ageesu ke pramukh sudesh mahato ne is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main 17 siton kii demand rakhi thi
 But the BJP wanted to give only 9 seats
 sudesh mahato ne bijepi ke sheersh netritv se mulaakaat kii thi, phir bhi seat shering kaa formula nahin nikal sakaa

 iske baad se jharkhand main jitani bhi bijepi kii sarkarein bani, ageesu sahabhaagi bani rahi
 Why the coalition broke down: Sudesh Mahato wants to increase his political base in Jharkhand
 vahiin, kai vipakshi dalon ke bade chehre jo naaraaz chal rahe hai, wo ageesu kaa darwaja khatkhata rahe hai
 Due to this, Sudesh Mahato has increased the demand for their seats
 jharkhand main pichley paanch saal main kaaphi raajnneeti uthaa-patake rahi
 AJSU was seeking Simaria, Sindri, Mandu and Chakradharpur seats along with the seats it had won in 2014 and where it stood second
 bijepi lagaataar ageesu ke daawey ko lagaataar khaarij karti rahi or ageesu apni maang par adi rahi
 The results of 2009 and 2014 were the basis of claim by AJSU on Chandankiyari
 2009 main umakant rajak ageesu se jite the or 2014 main duusare sthaan par rahe

 aise main bijepi is seat ko maang rahi thi, jis par ageesu raji nahin thi
 The same Lohardaga seat was also trapped, Kamal Kishore Bhagat of AJSU won this seat in 2014, but later he was convicted
 is seat par upachunaav main congress ke sukhdev bhagat jite the
 Before the election, he has joined BJP and the party has given ticket
 vahiin,chakradhrpur vidhansabha se bijepi ke pradesh lakshmana giluamaidan main utaara he, jabaki is seat ko ageesu kisi bhi surat main nahin chhodana chaahati thi
 This led to bitterness in the relationship and the 19-year-old friendship has almost broken
 bjp-ajsukaba-kab kitni siten ladibijepi or ageesu 2000 main bhale hi saath milakar sarkaar banaai ho, lekin chunaav 2014 main milakar ladi thi
 Apart from this, both of them have tried different luck in all the elections held
 2005 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne 63 siton par ladi thi or 30 siten jiti thi
 Whereas, AJSU contested 40 seats and won two seats
 2009 vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi 67 seat par ladakar 18 siten jiti thi or ageesu 54 seat par ladakar 5 siten jiti thi
 In 2014, BJP-AJSU contested jointly
 bijepi 72 siton par ladi 37 jiti or ageesu 8 siton par ladakar 5 jiti thi
 In this way, the fortress of friendship of BJP and AJSU formed in the year 2000 has been destroyed

 Shiv Sena has once again targeted the BJP
 nai gathbandhan sarkaar ke gathan main siem pad ko lekar jari khinchataan par shivasena ne apane mukhpatr saamana main bijepi par gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 The Shiv Sena wrote that the BJP will have to form a government by breaking the mlas of ED, police, money, other parties on the strength of the attack
 shivasena ne saamana main likhaa-"maharashtra kaa chunaav parinaam spasht he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party won 105 seats
 shivasena saath nahin hoti to yah aankada 75 ke paar nahin gaya hota
 It was 'yuti' that gained momentum
 ‘yuti’ thi tab ise kitni siten mili isaki bajaay chunaav se pehle ‘yuti’ karte samay kya qaraar hua tha, wo mahatvapurn he
 The Shiv Sena got 56 seats but Mr
 Fadnavis is not ready to give the Shiv Sena the post of Chief Minister for two and a half years as per the conditions laid down earlier
 padon kaa samaan bantwaaraa aisa record par bole jane kaa saboot hone ke baavjood bijepi ke devendra fadanvis palati maarthe hai or police, sibiai, idi, iskar vibhaag kii madad se sarkaar banane ke liye haath kii safai dikhaa rahe hai
 What is this example of democracy? "" Why did Indira Gandhi impose an emergency, who has become such as to address that day as a black day
 is par hairaani hoti he
 After the election results were declared on the 24th, the same day, Chief Minister Fadnavis should have started the discussion first with great pride in 'matoshree'
 vaataavaran tanaavpurn nahin hua hota lekin 105 kamalon kaa haar matlab amarpatta koun ise chhinega? varsh 2014 kii tarah shivasena tamaam sharten maan legi, sabhi is bhram main rahe
 Uddhav Thackeray cleared this confusion in the first 8 hours
 varsh 2014 main shivasena satta main shaamil hui
 Now the Shiv Sena will not show haste and will not go on kneeling, they adopted such a policy and closed the door of futile discussion
 "sahitya ajtak main registration ke liye yahaan clic karen"‘shivasena ke bagaiyr bahumat hoga to sarkaar bana lo, mukhyamantri ban jaao!’ yah sidhaa sandesh shri uddhav thakare ne diya
 There is no opponent or contender for the post of Chief Minister in the party today for Mr
 Devendra Fadnavis
 yah ek ajeebogareeb sanyog he
 Had Mr
 Gopinath Munde been there today, the scene of Maharashtra would have looked different and Munde would have become the Chief Minister, so the bitterness could not have been seen in the future today
 shri munde kaa nidhan ho gaya
 Eknath Khadse was already marginalized and put an end to it
 iske liye girish mahajan ne intjaam kiya
 Now Khadse's daughter was also defeated from the 'muktai Nagar' constituency
 pankaja munde parajeet ho gayi
 Vinod Tawde was brought home and Chandrakant Patil was put in trouble
 phir bhi devendra fadanvis sarkaar nahin bana sake tathaa ek-ek nirdaleey ko jamaa kar rahe hai parantu is guna-ganit se 145 ekatrit ho jaaenge kya?"maharashtra main vartmaan paristhitiyon main kya ho saktaa he
 Check it-stake-1: BJP can stake claim to form the government by being the largest party except Shiv Sena
 bhaajapa ke paas 105 vidhayak hai
 40 more will be required
 yah sambhav nahin hua to vishwasamat prastaav ke dauraan sarkaar dharashaayi ho jaaegi or 40 hasil karnaa asambhav hi dikhataa he
 Stake-2: Like 2014, the Nationalist Congress Party will support the Bharatiya Janata Party
 rashtravaadi congress, rashtriya loktantric gathbandhan main shaamil hogi, iske badale supriya sule ko centre main tathaa ajit pavaar ko rajya main pad diya jayega parantu varsh 2014 main kii gai bhayankar bhul shri pavaar ek baar phir karenge isaki leshmaatr bhi sambhaavna nahin he
 Pawar has been successful in opposing the BJP and Maharashtra beheaded him
 aaj ve shikhar par hai
 Their fame will be found in the soil
 sahitya ajtak kii puri kawarej yahaan dekhendaanv-3: bijepi vishwasamat prastaav main bahumat siddh karne main naakaam hogi tab duusari badi party hone ke naate shivasena sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karegi
 With the help of Nationalist 54, Congress 44 and others, the majority figure will reach 170
 shivasena apana khud kaa mukhyamantri bana sakegi tathaa sarkaar chalaane kaa saahas unhen karnaa hoga
 For this, parties with three independent views will have to plan and move forward with equal or concordance
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ne jis tarah dilli main sarkaar chalaai thi, usee tarah sabhi ko saath lekar aage badhanaa hoga
 Maharashtra has an interest in this
 daanv-4: bhartiya janata party tathaa shivasena ko majaboor hokar saath aana hoga or sarkaar banani hogi
 For this, both have to take four steps back
 shivasena kii maangon par vichaar karnaa hoga
 The post of Chief Minister will have to be divided and this is a great synonym but it is not possible due to ego
 daanv-5: idi, police, paisa, dhak aadi ke dam par anya partiyon ke vidhayak todakar bhaajapa ko sarkaar banani padegi
 For this, a representative of the ED will have to be included in the cabinet, but what happened to the change-makers, the voters showed it
 foot daalkar bahumat hasil karnaa, mukhyamantri pad paanaa aasaan nahin he
 All of this will tarnish Modi's image

 People are upset and are also disappointed at not taking any concrete steps from the government
 desh ke yuva behatar bhavishya kaa sapana le kar gurugram kaa rukh karte hai
 The offices of highrise societies and big multinational companies confirm that this city is growing on the path of progress every day
 lekin, andar se dekhen to ye shahar puri tarah khokhla ho chukaa he
 More important than roti cloth and house is clean water and clean air and both things are missing from Gurugram
 sabase chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki sarkaar is par maun he
 The biggest feature of vacant malls and marketplaces are its large malls and shopping complexes
 smog or badhate pradooshan ke chalate in dinon gurugram ke zyaadaatar bazaar or malls suune pade hai
 The romantic looks on the weekend were missing, and those who were seen also went out for the much needed shopping
 gurugram ke ek nami company main kaam karne vaale abhisht kaa kahana he, "infrastracchar sab kuch nahin hota, aap khud hi dekhie yahaan har taraf construction chal rahaa he par sarkari ho yaa gaiyr sarkari koi bhi niyam follow nahin kar rahaa

 mevaat fatah karne ko bijepi ne banaaya planamevaat main bijepi ne utaare 2 muslim pratyaashee2014 main BJP ko mevaat main nahin mili thi sitaharyana vidhansabha chunaav main un kshetron main bhi raajnneetik taasir badalati najar rahi he jo kabhi alag raah par najar aate the
 One of these areas is Mewat in Haryana, where BJP could not feed lotus even in Modi wave
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ne muslim bahul mevaat kii siyaasi jameen ko upjau banane or is ilaake main camel khilaane ke liye do diggaj muslim netaaon par daanv lagaaya he
 In this, Zakir Hussain from Nuh assembly seat and Naseem Ahmed from Ferozepur Jhirka region have been nominated
 bijepi ne haryana main do muslim candidet utarkar ek saath do daanv khele hai
 The first is that by 2 tickets, it has broken the myth that BJP gives less tickets to Muslims
 doosraa yah he ki bijepi jin muslim bahul ilaakon ko kaaphi koshishon ke baad bhi jeet nahin saki thi, vahaan par muslim kaddavar netaaon ke sahare jeet darj kaa sehara baandhna chaahati he
 It was not open in Mewat in 2014, let the BJP account that in Mewat area, BJP has been trying to strengthen its political land for a long time, but due to the Muslim majority area, it could not make a foothold here
 isi kaa nateeja he ki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main mevaat ilaake kii paanch vidhansabha siton main se mahaj ek seat hi jeet saki thi
 While three seats went to the account of INLD and one seat to independents
 mevaat ke teen muslim MLA ne thama thabijepi kadaman2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav membijapi ne haryana kii sabhi 10 loksabhasiten jeet lee hai, lekin jab isaki vidhansabhavar samiksha kii gai to pataa chalaa ki 11 siton par party congress va anya partiyon se peeche thi
 These 11 seats were from Mewat and Jatland
 isliye party ne yahaan ke muslim vidhayakon par dore daalana shuru kiya tha or is ranneeti main kaamyaab bhi hoti najar aa rahi he
 Three Muslim mlas from Mewat area joined BJP
 inamen jakir hossain or naseem ahamed inelo chhodkar bijepi main shaamil hue the, jinhen party ne tikat dekar maidan main utaara he
 While Rahis Khan, an independent MLA from Punhana, also joined BJP, the party could not trust him
 bijepi ne unki jagah naukshaam choudhary ko tikat diya he, jo ki dalit samudaay se hai
 In Mewat, it is the Muslim voters who aim to win Mission-75 plus seats in kingbjp Nehriana
 isliye usne muslimon ko bhi tikat dekar sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas kaa sandesh diya he
 BJP wants to win 5 assembly seats of Mewat region in this time assembly elections
 iske liye vah harsambhav koshish kar rahi he
 Muslim voters in Haryana 7
 2 fisadi hai, lekin mevaat main 70 fisadi ke kareeb muslim aabaadi he
 Muslim voters are in a decisive role in Meenat's Nuh, Punhana, Ferozepur Jhirka seat
 iske alaava sohana or hathin seat par muslim kingmekar kii bhoomika main hai
 In this, the BJP could win the Hathin seat last time
 ateet kii agar baat karen to mahaj ek baar haryana vikaas party-bijepi gathbandhan ke dauraan kanvar surajpal tavadu vidhansabha main kadi mashkkat ke baad jeet darj kar paae the

 mevaat par khatter meharbaan, kya jeet paaenge muslimon ke dil?mevaat main apana aadhaar badhaane ke liye bijepi kii sarkaar kai vikaas pariyojnaon kii aadharshila rakh chuki he
 The CM has worked to win the trust of the people through the inauguration of the Government College and Sub Divisional Officer (civil) Building at Punhana, the expansion of the Circuit House in the Minor Secretariat Complex of Nuh and the Working Women's Hostel at MDA Colony
 mevaat main driveron ke licenson ke navinikaran kii badi samasya he, jise lekar bhi manohar laal khatter ne pahal kii thi
 Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar met Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari and demanded exemption from compulsory educational qualification to drivers
 khatter ne gadakari se kaha tha ki anivaary yogyata ke niyam kii vajah se mevaat kshetra ke 20,000 se zyada driveron ke license kaa navinikaran nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Khattar demanded the renewal of these driver's licenses and the removal of this rule in the interest of new drivers
 khatter ke is kadam se mevaat main bijepi kaa graph badha he
 In such a situation, it is to be seen whether their bet gets converted into votes

 com / hpcfcuv2nz saal 2016 share bazaar niveshkon ke liye kuch khaas nahin rahaa
 Due to global developments and demonetisation, it was a year where stock market investors did not get any returns
 vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki kam se kam agle chah maheene tak bazaar main sudhaar kii bahut zyada ummid nahin dikhaai detii
 The stock market finally reached the level of almost the previous year after being up or down during the whole year
 yah lagaataar doosraa saal he jab share bazaar niveshkon kii ummid par khara nahin utar paaya
 In the last year 2015, the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensex kept investors at a loss of five percent, in this sense, this year can be considered somewhat better
 sensex kaa halsaal 2016 ke pehle din yani ek janvari kosencex26,307 ank par band hua tha, vahiin 21 disambar ko sensex 26,242 ank par band hua
 From this perspective, the year of 2016 has been such that the Sensex has been almost flat
 globe capital market li
 Chairman Ashok Aggarwal said that this year, although the market was down all year, it has been steadily coming down since the government's decision on demonetisation
 abhi kam se kam chah maheene tak sensex main bahut adhik sudhaar kii ummid nahin dikhti
 However, it is expected that the government can provide some relief on the taxes front in the budget, with interest rates likely to come down
 iske baad bazaar main kuch teji aegi
 However, if foreign institutional investors make purchases, the market situation may improve in the coming days
 aisa bhi nahin he ki bazaar main bahut adhik utaar-chadhaav aae, yah simit daayre main hi rahegaa
 Experts Royazad Financial Services Pvt

 The market has come down slightly since the demonetisation move by the government, however, for the betterment of the market, it is expected that the government will take some steps on the policy front that will improve the market situation next year
 aaazaad kaa maananaa he ki abhi arthvyavastha ke har kshetra main susti kaa alam he
 From industry to small businessmen, even inflation is still down
 aise main bazaar se bahut ummid karnaa bemaani hoga
 Nifty's National Stock Exchange's Nifty closed at 7,963 points on the first day of 2016, while it is currently around the 8,000 mark
 is lihaaj se nifti main bhi niveshkon ko kaaphi simit ritern hi mila he
 CNI Research Ltd
 ke chairman evam prabandh nideshak kishor pi
 Ostwal said that demonetisation is still in effect
 iske alaava vaishvik kaaran bhi hai, jo bazaar ko prabhavit kar rahe hai
 The Nifty may hit the 9,000-mark in June 2017 if the government takes steps in line with the budget and then market expectations, as taxes are lower, interest rates come down
 share bazaar ke liye kaisaa tha pichhlaa 5 salpichley kuch saal kii baat kii jaae, to 2015 main sensex main niveshkon ko kareeb paanch pratishat kaa nuksaan hua tha
 In the last few years, investors suffered the most in the global recession of 2008

 iske baad kai dinon tak jeet kaa silsilaa rahaa
 Film Name: tamashadirector: Imtiaz Alistar Cast: Deepika Padukone, Ranbir Kapoor, Javed Sheikh, Nikhil Bhagat, Faraj Sarawaiah, Poonam Singh, Piyush Mishra Duration: 2 hours 31 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 3 starimtiaz Ali in his film career We have made more than one film like 'we Met', 'love Aaj Kal', 'rockstar' and somewhere those stories also entertain the audience
 is baar imtiyaaj ne ranbir kapur or deepika padukon ke saath ek alag tarah kii lav story pesh karne kii koshish kii he, jahaan ek taraf deepika apane kariyar ke sheersh par hai vahiin ranbir kii acting kii saraahna to har film main hoti he lekin durbhagyavash unki pichhali kuch filmein naakaamayaab raheen hai
 Will Imtiaz Ali's 'tamasha', ranbir-deepikaki duo be able to entertain the audience? Come find out in the film review: Kahani This is the story of Ved Vardhan Sahni (ranbir Kapoor), who lives in Shimla, who does not mind his studies, but his father (javed Sheikh) insists that Ved is with the study of Mathematics- Do engineering as well
 veda ko alag-alag tarah kii kahaniyaan sunne or sunaane kaa bada shauk he
 Believing the father's point, Veda starts to give up her dreams and in the meantime, after meeting Tara Maheshwari (deepika Padukone), within the Veda, the hope of making her dreams come true
 donon corsika(france) kii trip par milte hai or alag-alag tarah ke filmi dialogs ke saath ek duusare se flert karne lagate hai
 Tara then feels that she does not fall in love with Veda, so she leaves Corsica and returns to India but once again Ved and Tara meet in Delhi and then the story goes on
 veda or tara ke bich kaaphi ladaai jhagade hote hai jisaki vajah se ye rishta kahin or jane lagata he, ab kya yah safarnama kaamyaab ho paata he? kya veda or tara kii lav story kaamyaab ho sakegi yaa laila-majanu, hir ranjha jaisaa haal hoga? iskaa jawaab aapako film dekhakar hi milegaa
 Scriptfilm has a tag line 'why always the same story? And to make the story different, Imtiaz has done a different experiment
 veda or tara kaa kirdaar acha likhaa gaya he lekin baaki kahani or bhi behatar ho sakati thi
 In the beginning of the film, Imtiaz is able to bring the childhood Vedas and his fantasies to the end, but the story drags in and out, which could have been shortened
 itani acchhee loketions or umdaa kalakaaron ke saath film kii kahani crisp hoti to tarif e kaabil kehalaati
 Abhinayadeepika Auranbir has acted in a very smooth manner
 is film main hasya, raudra, karun or shringaar ye chaaro ras hai, jisko abhinay ke daurandipika or ranbirne shat pratishat anjaam diya he
 There are some scenes where there are no alphas but if you get laughter just by looking at the facial expressions, then the inner gum also comes out
 piyush mishra or bos ke rup main vivek mushran ne bhi thik kaam kiya he
 The music film is perfect according to the music plot and due to the songs, the film also improves
 'matargashti', 'agar tum saath ho', 'hir' jaise gane pehle se hi kaaphi pasand kiye ja rahe hai
 a
 aar rahamaan kaa sangeet or irshaad kamil ke alfaaz vaaki kaanon main ras bharne jaise hai
 Weak Link The weak link of the film is its script which seems to lose its grip somewhere in between
 script thodi or crisp ho sakati thi
 The flashbacks and repetition in the currently running story can be seen at many places
 kyon dekhegar aapranbir-deepikaki jodi or inke abhinay ke kaayal hai, saath hi agar aap imtiyaaj ali kii filmon se ittefaq rakhte hai, to 'tamaasha' jarur dekhen
 BJP leader Arun Jaitley tried to overcome his defeat in Amritsar by saying that it was like a drop in the sea amid bjp's unprecedented victory in the Lok Sabha elections

 The Government of Pakistan is still implementing the blasphemy law

 In several recent attacks, the ministry said that there have been armed attacks on hard-security establishments, including military institutions and airports
 aatankwaadiyon ne kai pakistani shaharon main vishvavidhyalayon, skulon, reliyon, poojasthalon or bade bazaaron ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya he
 Therefore, we should take precautions

 Former Karnataka Chief Minister SM Krishna had made a formal announcement to break his ties with the Congress party a few days ago
 ab unke bijepi main jane kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 This time BJP leader and former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa said that he (krishna) will become a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 isse pehle krishna ne bataaya tha ki upie-2 ke kaarykaal ke dauraan achaanak jis tarah se unhen videshmantri ke pad se hataaya gaya vah tiraskaarpurn tha
 He worked with Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi
 kam se kam unhen bulaakar sammanjanak tareeke se vidaai di ja sakati thi jo ki hua nahin
 He was very disappointed with this
 pichley shanivaar ko media se baat karte hue krishna ne jaankaree di thi ki maine congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko patr likhakar bataaya tha ki vah party chhodana chaahate hai
 After the cabinet expansion in 2016 last year, when the Congress rebellion against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was in full swing, it is said that the Congress high command approached him so that the protest could be suppressed
 kehete hai ki tab krishna ne khud ko aage kar mukhyamantri ke taur par pesh karne kii koshish kii thi
 Since then, the gap between SM Krishna and the Congress central leadership had increased
 haalanki is khabar kii kabhi bhi esaem krishna kii taraf se pushti nahin kii gai
 Meanwhile, Krishna has also changed his name plate
 pehle krishna ke ant main sirf ek e hota tha ab uski jagah do e dikhe
 When asked, Krishna said that he had taken this step to "kicks" to jump the stairs of success
 tippaniyan Krishna was quite popular at one time, but at this age of 84 years, now he is weak in the changed political environment
 devegoda se unke nijee sambandh bahut bharosemand nahin hai, aise main bijepi se bhavishya main vah naata jodenge aisa mana ja rahaa he
 Even though SM Krishna's hold on the Vokaligga voters is not as strong as it was before, but in almost half a dozen assembly constituencies in the Mysore Mandya region, he has a decisive role to play

 krishna ek samay main kaaphi lokapriy the, lekin 84 saal kii is umr main ab vah pakad badale hue rajanithik parivesh main kamazor pade hai
 His personal relations with Deve Gowda are not very reliable, so it is believed that he will join the BJP in the future
 bhale hi esaem krishna kii pakad vokaligga voters par pehle jaisi majboot na ho lekin mysore mandya kshetra kii taqariban aadha darjan vidhansabha kshetron main haar jeet ke bich nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaane kii haisiyat rakhte hai
