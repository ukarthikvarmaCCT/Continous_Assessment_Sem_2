 The latest incident of theft has taken place in Sector 15 of Gurugram, where thieves blew away lakhs of items from a shop
 dukaan main lage CCTV camere main haalanki chori kii yah puri vaardaat kaid ho gai he or donon chor bhi camere kii jad main aa gaye hai
 The police have registered a case and started searching for the thieves with the help of CCTV footage
 sisitivi main dekha ja saktaa he chor bade hi itminan se chori karte najar aa rahe hai
 The shop located on the main road in Sector 15 of Gurugram here was targeted by thieves
 do chor dukaan kaa taala tod ghuse
 During the robbery, there was no fear at all on the faces of the thieves
 donon choron ne bade aaraam se dukaan se lakhon ke keemtee mobile chori kiye or rafuchakkar ho gaye
 Let us tell you that in Gurugram, the incidents of theft from robbing of atms and entering shops and homes are continuously increasing
 haal ke dinon main sibar city gurugram main aparaadhiyon kaa aatank badhata ja rahaa he
 Crimes such as theft, snatching, robbery, murder and rape are the culprits and they get very comfortable

 Western Railway is expected to provide safe travel to people with automatic doors in Mumbai's local trains, but the challenge is to face the crowd of 8 million people
 local trainon ke maujuuda dizine par yatriyon kii dashakon puraani aadaten bani hai
 To this day, due to the open doors, people are accustomed to standing in the door and traveling or climbing from the moving train
 mumbai main madhya or pashchim railway suraksha ayukta kaa kahana he ki pashchim railway ne in darwaazon ko lagavane se pehle unase raay-mashvira nahin kiya
 Local halts of Mumbai stop about 30 seconds
 automatic darvaaze khulne main qareeb dhai second lagate hai, or utana hi samay darvaaze band hone main lagata he
 That is, in every 30 second halt at every station, only 25 seconds passengers get up and down
 sunne main chota lagata ye samay logon kii bheed, or har tisare minute ek train ke lakshya ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 The Commissioner of Railway Safety, Mumbai has told NDTV that the Railways did not consult them before installing these doors
 pashchim railway ke pravaktaa sharat chandrayan ne enditivi se kaha, 'baat nai train kii nahin he, hamane puraani train main hi sudhaar kiya he
 In such a situation, this matter does not come under the purview of the Security Commission
 ' But the argument of the Railways seems weak because the Security Commission seriously considers many aspects of the railways apart from the coaches
 inamen patariyon ke upar se guzarate pul, platefarm kii oonchai jaise maamle shaamil bataaye jate hai
 One major drawback of the automatic compartments is that they do not give audio warnings before closing, such as the arrival of the next station
 aise main chaar maheene tak jin darwaazon par railway ne kaam kiya, unhen suraksha ayog ko na dikhaanaa, choti baat nahin lagati

 sthaan: rajasthan ke alvar jile ke mahal main sthit jila va seshan jaj kailash chandra sharma kii adaalat, jahaan rajavaadon ke jamaane main maharaja alvar kaa janata darbar sajaa karata tha
 At around 12 noon, the District Judge, as soon as Dr
 lalit kishor jhalani kii maut ke liye rajasthan sarkaar ke mukhya sachiv, pramukh shashan sachiv, alvar jila colector or peedbludi vibhaag ke sthaneey adhishasi abhiyantaa kii laaparvaahee ko jimmedaar tehraaya,
 The deceased Dr
 present in the court room
 lalit kishor jhalani ke 30 varshiya bete dow
 The sage's eyes became moist remembering his father
 ve apane dil ke us ehsaas ko india today se saajha karte hai, ''jaj ne jaise hi faisla sunaaya, mujhe laga- aakhir nyaay mil gaya
 The battle has been long, but the fight is yet to come
 ”kya tha maamladansal is aitihaasik faisle kii prishthbhumi main 2 april, 2008 ko alvar jile ke company baag main hua ek haadasa he, jisamen 56 varshiya dow
 Jhalani was killed
 hameshaa kii tarah us din bhi ankhon ke dow
 Jhalani along with his wife Pratibha Jhalani and other doctor friends were taking a morning walk in Alwar's famous company Bagh
 achaanak pipal ke sookhe ped kii ek badi daal jhalani ke sir par giri
 He was rushed to Solanki Hospital in the city due to a serious injury
 haalat kharaab hone kii vajah se unhen gudgaanv ke paras aspataal refer kar diya gaya
 But due to delay in treatment, Dr
 jhalani kii usee din maut ho gai
 She was studying MD and Jhalani's daughter, Dr
 maanasi bataati hai, ''laaparvaahee kaa alam is kadar tha ki us din park kaa main get band tha or koi guard nahin tha
 So it took about 45 minutes to get the seriously injured father out of the park
 agar deree nahin hoti to shaayad unhen bachaaya ja saktaa tha
 "in the verdict, after nearly five years of fighting in this case, the District and Sessions Judge of Alwar, Kailash Chandra Sharma, admitted that the cause of Jhalani's death was the negligence of the government employees
" jila adaalat ne apane aadesh main na sirf company baag ke rakrakhaav main laaparvaahee ke liye sthaneey adhishasi abhiyantaa (exen) ko jimmedaar tehraaya, balki shashan kii shrinkhalaa main aane vaale adhikariyon alvar colector, peedbludi ke pramukh shashan sachiv or mukhya sachiv ko bhi is laaparvaahee kaa jimmedaar maanate hue doshi tehraaya
 Dr
 jhalani ke parivaar ne iskar ritern ke aadhaar par 5
 32 crores Rs
 ke muaavje kii maang kii thi, lekin court ne ek karod 76 hajaar ru
 Ordered to be compensated
 jila adaalat ne faisle main is raashi par 28 janvari, 2009 se 31 janvari, 2014 tak 12 fisadi ke hisaab se or uske baad kaa kul rakam par 6 fisadi byaaj kaa salanaa bhugtan karne nirdesh diya he
 How much will affect the bureaucracy, in the court room where Justice Sharma was delivering the verdict, the District Collector also has his office in the same premises just a few steps away and he is also a party in the court's decision
 lekin faisle par colector aar
 s
 jakhad se pratikriya maangane par bhadakte hue kehete hai, ''pehle file aane dijie, phir ham tippanee karenge
 Will not comment on what is going on in the air
 ”unhone is faisle kii jaankaree par chhapi khabaron ko bhi halke main lete hue kaha ki media main khabaren chhapati hi rahati hai
 However, when India Today spoke to the judge Kailash Chandra Sharma regarding this decision, he refused citing the rules
 lekin unhone kaha, ''hamaara kaam faisla dena tha, so de diya
 "this decision may sound tough to see and hear, but in this decision, instead of holding an officer personally responsible, the post has been held guilty
 muaavje kii rakam kaa bhugtan bhi sarkari khajaane se hoga
 Therefore, this decision will not affect the government officials, unless the government shows strictness
 agar sarkaar is faisle kii bhaavana ko samajhate hue muaavje kii rakam taatkaaleen adhikariyon ke vetan yaa pension se vasuulne kii niti bana le to nishchit taur se baaki afasarshahi ko jimmedaari kaa ehsaas karaayega
 Anil Gupta, a lawyer for the Jhalani family and Rajeshwar Nand Sharma, his assistant lawyer in Alwar, says, "the case is not held by any person but the office is guilty, so it will not have any impact on the career of the officers who were at the time of the incident
" ”jila adaalat ne apane 11 panne ke faisle main vistaar se sarkaar kii sari daleelon ko khaarij kar laaparvaahee ko mana he
 The government also tried to make the tree's tree dry in court, denying the tree as green
 lekin peedit paksh ne puraani khabaron ke aadhaar par sabit kar diya ki tamaam shikayaton ke baavjood prashasan ne laaparvaahee dikhaai
 Police investigation report found 30-foot-tall Duchee to be dr
 jhalani kii maut kii vajah bataaya gaya tha
 Anil Gupta, a lawyer for the Jhalani family, says, "we have seen Dr
 jhalani kii aay ke aadhaar par muaavja maanga tha
 Now the court has accepted government negligence but we will appeal to the upper court to increase the compensation amount
 ” sarkari paksh ne adaalat main is durghatana ko act of god bataaya, lekin gupta kehete hai ki sarkari paksh is daleel ko sabit karne ke liye koi sakshya pesh nahin kar paaya
 The verdict of the Alwar district court can be challenged in the upper court, but the verdict is a danger bell not only for government officials and employees who spend the day instead of working responsibly, but also those ordinary citizens of the country
 There is a wayfarer who usually takes such incidents as mere accident or destiny and sits quietly
 jhalani parivaar bhi shuru main ise niyati maan baitha tha, lekin use achaanak maaloom padaa ki jis ped kii daal ne dow
 The negligence and inaction of the government is responsible for Jhalani's life
 is laaparvaahee par maanasi kaa gussa foot padataa he, ''mukademe ke dauraan kabhi-kabhi lagata tha ki aisa sirf bharat main hi ho saktaa he kyonki baahar ke deshon main maanav jivan ko kaaphi ahmiyat di jaati he

 For example, can a foreigner also win the National Award of India? And if someone is not a citizen of India, how can he get the National Award for India? Let us tell you that Akshay Kumar won the National Award for Best Actor for the film Rustom in 2016
 is film main unhone indian navy officer kaa role nibhaayaa tha
 This issue becomes even more important when in the same year Manoj Bajpayee was considered the strongest contender for this award for the film Aligarh
 iske alaava dakshin bharat kii film kamatthipadam main vinayakan ko bhi is aword kaa bada daavedaar mana ja rahaa tha
 But both lagged behind Akshay Kumar
 ek senior film critic ne to twit kar yah tak kah diya ki neshnal film awords main farji rashtrawaad ke chalate tallent kii bali chadha di gai he

 kya jeuri yaa ministry ne akshay ke maamle main galati kii thi galati kii thi to kya is galati ko ab sudhara ja saktaa he?yes, this is a very important question
 Are Canadian citizens eligible for India's National Awards? The year (2016) Akshay Kumar won 'best Actor', we were expecting Manoj Bajpayee to win for Aligarh

 Recalling his 'babuji', Amitabh Bachchan often says, "it is good if it is of the mind - and it is good if it is not of the mind
" ” dilli chunaav ke nateezon se itnaa to saaf hi he ki ye pradhanmantri narendra modike man ke nahin hai
 Now if it is not in their mind, then what is good in it? Let us hear from Prime Minister Modi in this special episode
 mitron,aaj meraa man bahut halkaa ho gaya he
 You siblings decide on my head
 dilli chunaav ke nattejey vaaki logon ke man kii baat he
 People have openly spoken their minds
 meri ore se aap sabhi ko sadhuwaad
 Today, there are some things in my mind that you have given an opportunity to share with you
 1
 Today i want to agree with the talk of Arvind Kejriwal going to become the Chief Minister of Delhi
 unhone bilkul thik kaha he ki ahankaar sabase bada dushman hota he
 In our party too, this arrogance was instilled in some people
 dilli chunaav ke nattejey usee kaa nateeja hai
 i have no qualms in accepting this
 2
 Amit Shah's faith reached the seventh sky only after winning record seats in Uttar Pradesh
 maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand main jeet hasil hone ke baad ye over confidence main tabdeel ho chukaa tha
 He even used to give such arguments and examples to get his point that he was allowed to do arbitrary
 3
 i agree that the mind of senior leaders in Delhi was ignored
 krishnanagar se kiran bedi kii haar se ye baat bhi saaf ho chuki he ki unke man kii baat ko ignor karne kaa kya khamiyaja hota he
 Otherwise the seat from which Dr
 harshavardhan barason se jitate aa rahe the, vahaan se kiran bedi jaisi shakhsiyat kaa haar janaa koi maamuli baat nahin he
 4
 kaaryakartaaon kii naaraazgi kaa alam ye tha ki ve dilli ke logon tak nahin pahunch paae
 His mind could not be heard
 unke man kii baat nahin samajhi ja saki
 This was the biggest deficiency from our side
 5
 If the elections to the Delhi Legislative Assembly were also held with Maharashtra and Haryana, the matter would have been different
 hamaare virodhiyon ne iskaa puraa phayda uthaaya, lekin hame ye baat samaj main nahin ai
 At least this is the excuse we have got the chance of self-inspection
 iske liye ham aap sabhi ke shukraguzaar hai
 6
 main ye to nahin maanata ki kiran bedi ji ko bijepi main laana or unhen bataur mukhyamantri pesh kiya janaa koi bahut hi ghatiya faisla tha
 Yes, i definitely believe that this decision was taken late
 agar kejariwal kii tarah kiran bedi ji ko bhi raajnneeti ko kareeb se samajhane kaa mauka mila hota to unhen ye shikast nahin milti
 7
 khayr, beeti taahi bisri de, aage kii sudhi lehu
 i also believe in this philosophy
 ab bihar kii baari he
 We are in no hurry
 varanaa maanjhi prakaran main master kii to hamaare hi haath main he
 But we have decided to leave it to the public
 ab hame bihar ke logon ke man kii baat kaa intjaar rahegaa

 ) bhartiya railway ke ek ejeeniyar ne shahari transport ke liye ek anoothaa hal khoj nikaala he
 The new novel transport concept, popularly known as the Caterpillar Train, has also been approved by the world's renowned technical institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
 railway main iarties adhikari ashvini kumaar upaadhyaay ke caterpillar train ke concept ko emiti ke climet coleb contest main popular category or jajej chwis donon main hi chunaa gaya he
 According to Ashwini Kumar, the idea of the Caterpillar train came to him when he was completing his research on MIT scholarship in Singapore
 yahaan par unki mulaakaat ek american ejeeniyar emil jaikab se hui
 Both worked for a year and a half with a unique concept and came up with the idea of caterpillar Train
 darasal caterpillar train kaa concept kaaphi saral he or dilli or mumbai jaise metro shaharon kii trephic samasya ke liye ek sthai hal he
 The special thing is that the cost of the metro train is only fifteenth
 iske alaava dilli jaise shahar main badhati kaaron ke bich choti-choti galiyon main last mil connactivity dena mushkil ho gaya he
 Learn how the caterpillar train will run? In the caterpillar train system, the entire train system can be built on the road itself

 ye dibbe aise honge ki inamen chaaron taraf get honge or ye jeepies ke jariye automated tareeke se bijli ke jariye chalenge
 These coaches will have eight pairs of small wheels to drive this train
 ye he is train kii khaasiyatancaterpillar train ko driver kii jarurat nahin hogi or iske stesan do patariyon ke cross section par bhi honge
 There will be only and only seating in the coaches
 in dibbon main yatri ke saamne screen hogi jisamen wo apni lokation chun sakegaa
 The train will land the passenger at the appropriate station
 agar train phul he or kisi stesan par koi yatri utar nahin rahaa he to wo train us stesan par nahin rukegi
 This will help in delivering passengers quickly
 is train ko 100 kilometre prati ghante kii ausat speed par chalaaya ja saktaa he
 Ashwini Kumar, an officer and engineer of offerrelway for rejected big companies, has filed a patent in the US and India to patent his concept
 ye unke concept kaa kamaal he ki jeei or alstram jaisi badi companiyon ne bhi unase baat kii he
 But these companies have put more emphasis on buying their patents, so Ashwani Kumar has rejected the offer of these companies
 unako ummid he ki desh ke shahari ilaakon main transport ko chust-durust karne ke liye bharat sarkaar unke is nae concept ko jarur apnayegi

 If the commissioners allow, they will make a mistake

 If they get the (hindu side) permission then we will also think something else

 'yani gaur kiijie tokanhaiya kumarase lekar hardik patel vaaya narendra modi tak paanch main har naam ke peeche laharaa rahe jhande (tirange ko chhodkar) kaa rang alag-alag hi he
 But this is not a cinema, so at the present time, going beyond the hunger bread of 1
25 billion, it is either pulses or a leader who can fulfill his aspirations, dreams and hopes
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki jhande ke rang ke saath hi in paanch naamon ke peeche mudde bhi alag-alag rahe hai
 The country should not be a 'leader' issue, 68 years after independence, there has been a steady increase in the number of leaders and honorable members in every state assembly from the Lok Sabha
 sthaneey str par bhi netaaon ke sankhyabal kii kami nahin he
 But it is unfortunate that in spite of all this, the public is still looking for a 'hero' who can speak for himself
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki charitra or chaal ke aage mudde gaun ho gaye hai
 Because only then did the rise of Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal raise their voices against corruption, then Narendra Modi on the strength of black money and poverty
 samudaay vishesh ke liye aarakshan kii maang kar hardik patel hero ban gaye todeshprem or deshvirodhiki bahes ne kanhaiya ko raaton-raat 'nayak' bana diya
 Neither would you
 
 
 raajnneetiyah bhi ajab sanyog hai ki in paanch se har kisi ne apane shuruaati dinon main raajnneeti ko 'naa' hi kaha he
 While two of them (kejriwal and Modi) are part of full-fledged politics, two (kanhaiya and Hardik) are currently refraining from politics
 jabaki baat chaatrasangh ke adhyaksh ke rup main ho yaa samudaay vishesh kii ladaai kii, donon netagiri hi kar rahe hai
 That is, two things are understood by looking at the current situation and previous examples
 pehali ki badlaav kii baat karne vaale har shaks ko aakhirkaar raajnneeti main aana hi padataa he or duusari yah ki jab aap samaaj or samudaay kii baat karte hai to naa naa karte hue bhi aapako raajnneeti se pyaar ho hi jaataa he
 What did you get in the last five years, what did you learn? If you talk about the last five years, there are many faces in the search for the 'hero' who is hungry for 125 crore people of the country, but it is not certain to be satisfied
 kyonki yahi kaaran he ki soshal media se lekar sadak tak aaj har koi kuch din hi sahi har us shaks ke peeche sambhaavna talash rahaa he, jo badlaav kii baat karata he
 But no one could find an instant remedy under the burden of expectations of regret
 jabaki desh beete 68 varshon main halaat or vyavastha se is kadar trast he use sukun bhi jhatpat chahie
 Just like a 'hero' movie
 ab aage kya
 
 
 There is still hunger
 talash jari he
 The old options are going awry! There are also expectations from the future
 lekin maujuuda samay main aam naagarik ke liye jaruri is baat kii bhi he ki instant upaay or chahat kii aadat main thodaa badlaav laayaa jaae
 That means patience
 yah dhairya netaa ke chunaav se lekar usko lekar raay kaayam karne tak har jagah najar aani chahie
 Because in the process of making instant opinions, there is hope and here is the matter of the country, not of two minute noodles

 "claiming that the top leaders of Al Qaeda had been killed in the last two-and-a-half years, he said that the death of Osama bin Laden, the head of the organization, was a major success for the US and proved to be the biggest setback for terrorist groups

 Pradeep Singh Ranawat, in-charge of Lasudia police station here, said on Thursday that a case was registered against his father-in-law Vijay Kushwaha (55) at Kotwali police station in Guna district on the complaint of a 25-year-old woman living in Aranya Colony
 guna police ne jaanch ke liye maamla lasudiya police thane ko saunpa he
 She told the woman's complaint that her husband did not like the newlyweds who came to Indore after marrying Guna

 Anna Hazare, who raised his voice against corruption, parted ways with Arvind Kejriwal the day Kejriwal announced the party poltics
 lekin farrukhabad main laharaae jane vaale postaron par kejariwal ke saath anna bhi najar aae
 Now the question is what does Anna's presence on the poster mean
 jis anna hajaare ko arvind kejariwal apana guru or maardarshak maanate hai, wo anna farrukhabad se kareeb 1400 kilometre dur apane gaanv ralegan siddhi main hai
 That Anna has distanced herself from Kejriwal's political humiliation and arrogance months before, but Kejriwal's supporters have bridged this distance on the poster
 india against karpshan ke poster par kejariwal ke saath anna kii tasviir chipka rakhi he
 Like Farrukhabad, such posters were found in Kanpur, in which Anna and Kejriwal are seen together
 ye poster isliye chaunkaa rahe hai ki jis vakt kejariwal ne apni raajnneetik party banane kaa elaan kiya tha, tabhi anna ne kejariwal and party se apni duuri kaa bhi elaan kar diya tha
 Anna had bluntly said that not even his picture will be used in Kejriwal's politics
 anna raajnneeti kii dhamachaukadi se khud ko bhale hi alag rakhana chaahate hai
 But despite the work standing behind him, Kejriwal feels that without Anna, it will not be easy to cross the political boat

 naren ne chaar over main 13 ran dekar ek wicket liya
 Ganguly, who came down the batting order, then shared a 73-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Mathews to return Pune to the match

 Seeing as it's World Breastfeeding Week- time to give some credit where credit is due
 Breastfeeding has played such a big part in getting back into shape after giving birth to my baby

 @artipoppea post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on Jul 8, 2017 at 8:36am pdtzack Lalvani born 17th May 2017A post shared by Lisa Haydon (@lisahaydon) on May 19, 2017 at 3:00pm PDT By the way, it is a privilege for all parents to give birth to their child
 vahiin kuch mata-pita apni aarthik sthiti or sehat ko dekhte hue sirf ek hi bachche ke saath rahane main yakeen rakhte hai
 But due to the pressure of the family on the second child, some people start planning for the other child
 jis kaaran wo aksar yah bhul jate hai ki unke bacchon ke janm main kitna antar hona chahie
 However, giving birth to children or planning for them is a personal matter of all parents
 lekin maa or bachche kii sehat ko dekhte hue kuch chijen dhyaan main rakhana behad jaruri he
 Today we are going to tell you the difference between the birth of two children and why? When you want a second child, it depends on you
 lekin doosraa baccha plan karne se pehle maa kii sehat ko jarur dhyaan main rakhen
 When the woman becomes fully healthy after giving birth to the first child, then only they should think for the second child
 haalanki, duusare bachche main bahut kam yaa zyada antar hone ke apane hi kuch phaayde or kuch nuksaan hote hai
 The difference between 12 to 18 months between the first and second child makes a deep connection between them
 lekin do bacchon ke bich kam antar hone se maa kii sehat par bura asar pad saktaa he
 Actually, having both children breast-feeding together, staying awake with them throughout the night, taking responsibility of two children together affects the health of the mother
 ek study ke mutabik, pehle or duusare bachche main kam se kam 18 maheene kaa antar hona jaruri hota he
 Because there is a risk of loss of weight of the child along with pre-mature delivery of the other child due to less difference
 health export ke mutabik, pehle or duusare bachche ke janm main lagbhag 2 saal kaa antar hona chahie
 He says that due to the difference of two years between two children, both mother and child are in good health
 agar do bacchon ke janm main 3 saal kaa antar hota he to pehla baccha thodaa samajhadaar hone lagata he
 Also, after giving birth to a child and breast feeding, the weakness in the mother's body is completely cured by that time
 iske alaava bacchon kii umr main antar hone se mata-pita donon bacchon kii sahi dhang se parvarish kar pate hai
 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the difference between the birth of the first and second child is about 24 months
 kyonki 24 maheenon main mahila kii sehat main puri tarah se sudhaar aa jaataa he
 If you want to give birth to another child before 24 months, then definitely keep a gap of 18 months in the birth of at least two children
 lekin health export kaa ye bhi kahana he ki duusare bachche ke janm main teen yaa usase zyada kaa antar hone se pregnancy or duusare bachche ke janm main thodi samasyaayen aa sakati hai

 Are you ready to use Kashmiris? kandhe se kandhaa
 
 kadam se kadam milaane ke liye taiyaar ho
 Kashmiris have no say with Hafiz Saeed
 kashmireo sun lo
 We are with you
 ham srinagar jane ke liye taiyaar he
 Parcham is ready to make waves in Srinagar
 jis vakt lahore main hafiz said kashmir main aatankwaadi hamale kii dhamkee de rahaa tha
 At the same time Rauf Asghar, the kingpin of jaish-e-mohammed and the younger son of Masood Azhar, was announcing a suicide squad in the name of Afzal Guru
 rauf asagar ne kaha tha ki aap suno
 
 ab kashmir kii jang kashmir ke pahaado se nikalakar ladi jaaegi
 
 sar par boj tha
 Afzal Guru Shaheed
 hisaab baraabar karnaa tha
 Afzal showed it with Guru's success
 
 It showed that the enemy had to agree
 sun lo
 The war of Kashmir will be fought from the mountains of Kashmir
 dilli main hone vaale faislon kaa jawaab tumhen dilli main diya jayega
 Hafiz Saeed's rally and Rauf Asghar's bid
 ye saboot he is baat kaa
 
 ki pulavama main hua abtak kaa sabase bada aatankwaadi hamalaa pakistan kii shah par hua
 After this, there was a competition to celebrate from Pakistan's militant camps to Pakistani army and ISI camps
 iesai ke purv chif le
 General (retd) Amjad Shueb said that the thinking of young people is very different from people like us
 
 The life that has passed 
 The feelings have cooled down
 
 This process has not started yet, which we call suicide bombing
 
 It has to begin
 
 When the Kashmiri young man understood that he had to be killed by them in the same way
 
 So by killing something, he will show it as one who dies
 
 He did not even take the nails of consciousness for India
 ye janaab hai pakistan kii khufia agency iesai ke purv chif amjad shueb
 Whose heart is jumping on the martyrdom of the soldiers of India in the Pulwama terror attack, and why not, because even though the attack in Pulwama was the act of Jaish, the command was from the ISI and the Pakistani army
 kyonki duniya jaanati he ki duniya ke liye bade se bada aatankwaadi bhi
 Without the consent of the Pakistani army and ISI, such a big attack cannot be carried out
 - jaish e mohammad sargana rauf asagar kaa karachi kii raily main main afzal guru ke naam par aatankiyon kaa aatmghaatee dasta banaae jane kaa elaan karnaa
 - Threatening Hafiz Saeed, the top terrorist of jamaat-ud-dawa, to attack Hindustan by standing amidst terrorist groups on the streets of Lahore
 - pakistan main in aatanki reliyon ke do din baad hi bharat main suraksha agenciyon ne aatmghaatee aatanki hamale kaa alert jari karnaa
 - And then within a week, the biggest terrorist attack ever happened in Kashmir
 ye ittefaq to katai nahin ho saktaa
 But the shame of Pakistan's shamelessness is that it is asking for proof from India
 pakistan ko agar saboot chahie to wo bas ek baar apane girebaan main jhaankne kii himmat kar le, kyonki bharat kii taraf se ab use saboot nahin
 Only you will get lessons
 pakistani media main bhi is baat kii charchaa he
 In Pakistan media, the experts there say that when Kartarpur was talked about, India said that Hafiz Saeed should be handed over to us
 
 Their demand is right
 
 Not of India
 
 
 yuan kaa bhi most wonted he
 
 masood ajahar bhi wonted he
 
 ye sari cheez jo he
 
 
 This much
 
 I'm afraid that this Joe
 
 There were gestures
 
 They should not rollback
 
 Now Ball is in India's court
 
 Now the action which was to be done is done
 
 Now is the reaction time
 
 Now India's reaction will tell a lot about the things of peace
 
 India Believes the talk of cooperation
 
 Seriously taking
 
 How Sirius will take India
 
 Will be revealed in two to four days
 bhartiya aatanrik suraksha visheshgy jayadev ranade ne kaha ki jhooth bolnaa or aatankwaadiyon ko paalna
 Pakistan has the same old habits
 jitna ki khud pakistan
 Forced by this same habit, Pakistan supports the terrorists against Hindustan and asks for evidence when caught
 pulavama hamale main apane haath ko pakistan chaahe jitna marji nakaare, lekin uske inkaar se sach badal nahin jayega

 beeti garmiyon main england ke haathon test or ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa main buree tarah patkhni khaane vaali bhartiya team ke paas english team se pichhali haar kaa hisaab chukaane kaa acha mauka he
 Both teams will play the first match of the five-match series on Friday at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Uppal, near Hyderabad
 yah muqabla tay karegaa ki bhartiya team ne pichhali haar se kuch sabak siikhaa he yaa nahin
 Or 'fatigue' still dominates his players
 kai pramukh khilaadi ab bhi team se baahar hai lekin kaiyon ko beete dinon main aaraam bhi mila he
 From this, it can be expected that the Indian players will perform their best leaving an excuse of fatigue
 english team ne pichhali shrinkhalaa main bharat ko chaar test maichon main 4-0 se or paanch ekadivasiy maichon main 3-0 se haraaya tha
 Not only this, India also lost in the only Twenty20 match
 us shrinkhalaa main bharat ko sarvocch variyata praapt test team kaa taj ganvaana padaa tha or vishwa champion hone ke naate kaaphi sharmidagi bhi jhelni padi thi
 However, the English team has indicated to be in the same form as before by winning both the practice matches played with the Hyderabad Cricket Association XI
 abhyaas match english team ke sabhi ballebaajon ne khulkar haath dikhaae or gendbaajon ne halaat ke saath talmail banane kaa bharpoor prayaas kiya
 Now that the actual match is going on, the English team may have some problems in front of the Indian team, but the visiting team is also aware that in the absence of the key players, the Indian team will not have the power, for which it Is known
 is shrinkhalaa ke shuruaati do maichon ke liye bhartiya team main sachin tendulkar or virendra sahvaag jaise diggaj shaamil nahin hai jabaki champiens lig se pehle khud ko feet ghoshit karne kebaavjood harbhajan singh ko baahar rakhaa gaya
 Karnataka medium-speed bowler Srinath Arvind and Punjab leg-spinner Rahul Sharma have been part of the ODI team for the first time
 saath hi saath england main ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa ke dauraan team kaa hissaa rahe tej gendbaaj varun aron ko team main banaae rakhaa gaya he
 Apart from Sachin and Sehwag for the first two matches, Zaheer Khan, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Munaf Patel and Ishant Sharma are not part of the team
 aise main bhartiya gendbaaji mukhya taur par praveen kumaar, vinay kumaar, umesh yadav, aron, ravichandran aswin or rahul jaise khilaadiyon par tiki hogi
 As far as batting is concerned, India has good players like Gautam Gambhir, Parthiv Patel, Ajinkya Rehane, Virot Kohli, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja apart from captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, due to which the Indian team has the power to win in domestic conditions
 
 is shrinkhalaa ke madhyam se bhartiya team ke paas isisi kii ekadivasiy tiimon kii ranking main england se aage nikalne kaa acha mauka he
 The Indian team can achieve this position by defeating England in the current series
 bhartiya team maujuuda samay main paanchaven kram par virajman he jabaki english team chauthe kram par he
 There is a difference of one rating point between the two
 duusari ore, ekadivasiy rankig main sheersh par kabiz austrailian team dakshin africa ke saath do-do haath karne ja rahi he
 In this sense, consistently good performance can give the Indian team a better position in the table
 dilli main south east district police kii special staff kii team ne ganja taskari karne vaale giroh kaa pardaafash kiya he
 The police arrested 4 gang members including a woman
 aropiyon ne behad shaatiranaa andaaj main car ke andar or car kii diggi main alag se taikhana bana rakhaa tha
 In this way, these people were executing Gorakhdhandhe for many years
 police ne inke kabze se123 kilo ganzabramad kiya he
 In addition, the car has also been recovered from the possession of the arrested accused, who used to smuggle all the cannabis
 police ne bataaya ki ye log kai saalon se nashe ke kaarobaar se jude hue hai
 In order to avoid the police, these vicious people modified their car in a way that was not imagined by the police
 vahiin police kii maane to wo kaaphi hairaan he
 Police say it is very difficult to check every vehicle in this way
 aise main agar koi suraag naa ho to inhen pakadana bhi kaaphi mushkil he
 During interrogation of the accused, it has been found that these people had been doing drug business in the same manner for many years till the capital city of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar and UP
 police ne gupt soochna ke aadhaar par ye karrwai kii

 When Varun Dhawan, son of legendary filmmaker David Dhawan, started his career with Karan Johar's "student of the Year", no one thought that he would go on to give back to back superhit films
 varun dhawan ko bollywood kaa ubharta hua superstar mana jane laga, lekin unke kariyar main speedbraker bani vah film jiske bollywood blockbster hit hone kii ummid kar rahaa tha
 We are talking about Karan Johar's film 'kalank'
 varun ke kariyar kaa k factor:varun dhawan ne jis film se apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kii uskaa naam tha student of da year
 The production of this film was in the hands of Karan Johar
 durbhaagya se varun dhawan ke kariyar kii pehali flop film bhi karan johar ke saath hi unhone di he

 However, this did not happen about stigma
 ise karan johar ke kariyar kii wo film kaha ja saktaa he jise na to critics ne saraahaa or naa hi janata ne pyaar diya
 Therefore, Karan Johar's multi-starrer film Kalank with a budget of 80 crores was badly beaten

 The film's business was so bad that trade analyst Taran Adarsh himself spoke about the beating of the film from his Twitter handle

 However, people were surprised when the opposite of the film's revenue increased significantly the next day

 After this, on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, when the film earned 11 crore 60 lakh, 9 crore 75 lakh and 11 crore 63 lakh respectively, the analyst's mind went around

 kya videsh mantralay kii jimmedaariyon main kisi bhi sthiti main videshiyon ko bharat main surakshit or aaazaad mahasoos karana nahin he?8
 In the past, when some extremist forces were working to provoke feelings about foreigners, what steps did the Ministry of External Affairs take to improve the environment? 9

 yoga vidya main shiv pehle yogi yaa aadi yogi maane jate hai

 How Yogguru became Babababa Ramdev was born to Ram Niwas Yadav and Gulabo Devi in alipur village of Mahendragarh district, Haryana
 unka pehle naam ramakrishna yadav tha
 After studying till the eighth, he set out to study Indian scriptures, yoga and Sanskrit in many gurukuls

 Then he reached Haridwar
 vah prasiddh hona tab shuru hue jab acharya baalkrishna ke saath unhone divya yoga mandir trust shuru kiya
 Gradually Baba Ramdev's popularity increased

 maine bataur kaaryakarta vahaan par kaam kiya, kashmir ke har jile main main rah chukaa hum
 The Prime Minister said that a handful of families have done emotional blackmail to the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 When Mufti Saheb was there, we thought he would come back

 The PM said that the public had given such a message that there was no other choice, we left it when democracy was appreciated
 vahaan sirf atal ji kaa hi formula chalegaa ‘insaaniyat-kashmiriat-jammurit’
 a handful of families speak one language in Kashmir and speak a different language in Delhi, which is the double-handedness that i am exposing

 Despite this, both the congress-bjp parties are eyeing their votes
 yahi vajah he kicongressdhyaksharahul gandhimoti masjid main jaakar mannaten maang rahe hai
 At the same time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is prostrating in front of the Muslims to feed the lotus for the fourth consecutive time in the state
 aath fisadi muslim matadaatamadhya pradesh main kareeb 8 fisadi musalmaan hai
 Around two dozen assembly seats in the state are Muslim dominated
 iske alaava ek darjan seat par muslim vot nirnaayak bhoomika main he
 Despite this, there is only one Muslim MLA out of 230 legislators in the state
 muslim matadaata aamtaur par congress kaa samarthak samajha jaataa tha, lekin jab 1967 main gaiyrcongresavad kii raajnneeti shuru hui or musalamaanon ko bhi vipaksh main congress kaa vikalp dikhaai diya to usne apana rukh badalanaa shuru kar diya
 However, the Muslim voters in Madhya Pradesh could not leave the Congress
 indore pesh se vakaalat kar rahe shaadaab saleem kehete hai ki madhya pradesh main muslimon ke saamne congress ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin he
 That is why Muslims are compelled to vote for the Congress even if they do not want to
 haalanki congress aurabijepimen bahut zyada fark nahin he
 The Bohra society of the state is with the BJP
 shivaraj kaa dharmanirpeksh chhavibta den ki madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne dharmanirpeksh chhavi banane kii koshish kii he

 'muslim majaburi main congress ke saath'shaadaab saleem ne shivaraj singh chouhan ke chalate musalamaanon ke ek bada tabaka empi main bijepi ko vot karata rahaa he
 One reason behind this was that the Congress was never seen winning
 pichley 15 saal main congress pehali chunaav ladati hui najar aa rahi he
 Apart from this, events like mob lynching have again forced Muslims to lean towards the Congress
 madhya pradesh main muslim vot kingmekar nahiraajnneetik vishleshak hidaayataulla khan kehete hai ki madhya pradesh main muslim matadaata duusare rajyon kii tarah kingmekar kii bhoomika main nahin he
 There are some seats, however, where he plays the deciding role
 bhopal or burhan seat ko chhod den baaki koi seat aisi nahin he, jahaan wo apane voton se jeet sake
 He said that there is no possibility of Muslims joining the BJP
 musalamaanon ko bijepi main shivaraj kaa nahin balki pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah kaa cheharaa dikhataa he
 a different voice comes from Bhopal and something else from Delhi
 aise main jo kuch shivaraj ke chehre par bijepi ko vot miltaa tha
 This time it is difficult to meet that also
 muslim bahul sitarajya ke 51 jilon main se 19 jilon main muslim aabaadi 1 lakh se zyada he
 Bhopal has the highest number of Muslim voters on the basis of number force

 Bhopal North has the highest percentage of 60 per cent in the Vidhan Sabha seat and 50 per cent in the Burhanpur seat
 indore-1, indore-3, bhopal madhya, ujjain or jabalpur seat par 30 fisadi se zyada muslim matadaata he

 1985 or 1990 main bijepi ke tikat par ek-ek muslim pratyaashee jitkar vidhansabha pahunche the
 Tell us that Muslim candidates have won on BJP ticket in Madhya Pradesh in 1985 and 1990 also on BJP ticket
 iske baad bijepi 1993 main bijepi ne gani ansaari ko ummidavaar banaaya tha, lekin wo apni jamaanat nahin bachaa sake the
 Due to this defeat, BJP had nominated a Muslim (arif Baig) from Bhopal North after 20 years in 2013, but he could not save his bail
 jabaki congress ne pichley chunaav main 4 muslim ummidavaar utaare the, jinamein se aarif akil hi jeet sake the

 Bhajji then told Shoaib Akhtar not to take anything
 iske baad bhajji ne akhtar ko 4 tikaten deen
 After this Akhtar also asked Bhajji for the final tickets, on which Bhajji said, what will you do for the final ticket, then we are going there and if you have to go to see the match, then you should book the ticket yourself
 harbhajan ne kaha ki 2019 world cap main bharat or pakistan match se pehle dabaav bharat par dabaav zyada hoga, kyonki jo pahalwaan damdaar hota he uske jehan main yah baat hoti he ki kahin haar na jaaen
 The second thing is that there will be pressure on Team India because then there are different types of reactions in the country
 pakistan ke paas khone ke liye kuch bhi nahin he, agar wo jeet jaati he to uske liye bonus hoga lekin bharat harata he to wo bharat ke liye bahut kharaab baat hogi
 On the political tension, Harbhajan Singh said that whenever we meet the players of Pakistan, we never feel that there has been any change
 ham agar inhen janmdin kii shubhakamanaayen bhi dete hai to desh main hamen gaaliyaan padani shuru ho jaati hai
 There will be some such people in Pakistan too
 lekin iskaa matlab ye nahin ki puraa pakistan or puraa bharat kharaab he

 maalegaanv blast ko lekar ab raajnneetik napha-nuksaan kaa khel bhi shuru ho gaya he
 What the name of Sadhvi Pragya Singh got in Malegaon Blast, Congress got a chance to attack BJP
 sadhvi pragna ke khilaaf indore congress kaaryakartaaon ne joardaar pradarshan kiya or isi bahaane bijepi par hamalaa bol diya
 The party also reiterated the demand for banning organizations like Bajrang Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Hindu Jagran Manch

 So they have given their mobile number to the leaders of the countries of the world and asked them to call directly without any frills
 trump kaa yah kadam rajanyik protocol ke khilaaf he
 This has raised concerns about the security of US President Trump and the secrecy of negotiations with foreign leaders
 america ke maujuuda or purv adhikariyon ne bataaya ki donald trump ne canada or mexico ke netaaon se kaha he ki ve unako (trump) ko sidhe phone karke baat karen
 US officials say that so far only Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken advantage of Trump's offer and broke the protocol and called directly
 francisi adhikariyon ke mutabik donald trump ne france ke navnirvaachit raashtrapati emanuel maikron se bhi mobile number kii adla-badali kii he
 The two leaders met after Emmanuel won the presidential election when the two took each other's mobile numbers
 haalanki abhi tak yah saaf nahin ho paaya he ki emanuel is tarah trump se baat karne ke icchhuk hai yaa nahin?aadhunik mobile or sibar yug main ek desh ke rajaneta kii ore se duusare desh ke rajaneta se sidhe phone par baat karnaa koi nai baat nahin he, lekin videshi maamalon ko lekar behad gopneeyata baratane kii parampara he
 Further, such direct communication is an open violation of diplomatic protocol

 That day, the Supreme Court concluded one of the darkest chapters in the history of independent India with its ruling in the 70-year-old Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid case
 aise kam hi vivaad hai jinhone desh ko dharmik aadhaar par itnaa saaf-saaf vibhajit kiya he jitna isane
 The poisonous mixture of politics and religion kept our country ripped apart for decades and brought us into a very difficult situation
 kisi aantarik sampradayik takaraav main itani nirdosh jaane—kam se kam 2,000—nahin gayi jitani ram mandir par uthe hinsa ke tufaan main gayi, jisamen khun kaa badla khun se lene kii pravritiyon ke ubhaar ke saath hi desh kii pashchimi seemaa par baithe shatru padosi ko sampradayik katutaa kii lapten bhadakaane ke maukey bhi mili
 The Supreme Court verdict is our chance to come back from the mouth of the moat
 desh kii sabase oonchi adaalat ne safagoi or faisle kii ahmiyat ko sahi hi zyada tavajjo di or virali sarvanumati or bemisaal santulan banaae rakhane kaa praytn kiya he
 The arguments with which the five learned judges came to the same conclusion will continue to have sharp arguments
 bahut-se log sawaal karenge ki kya nyaayadhishon ne nyaayashastra par aasthaa ko ahmiyat di
 And whether he ignored the facts and evidences that emerged in the course of the trial and adopted a pluralistic view
 lekin in tarkon-vitarkon kii garmi main bhi yah baat garv ke saath sweekaar kii jaani chahie ki yah faisla nirdhaarit prakriyaaon kaa dridhtaa se paalan karte hue hajaaron pannon main faile or pichley kai dashakon main shramsadhy tareeke se tukdaa-tukdaa jode gaye saakshyon tathaa sabhi sambhddha pakshon kii acchhee tarah sunwaayee ke baad ubhara
 The tone and intent of this decision was a clear signal and appeal for all to move forward collectively as a nation
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne faisla aane ke baad shanti kii apil karte hue sahi sanket kiya ki ''is vivaad ne kai peedhishon ko prabhavit kiya ho saktaa he, lekin is nirnay ke baad hamen sankalp lenaa he ki ab ek nai peedi ek nae bharat kaa nirmaan karnaa shuru karegi
 The Supreme Court's decision has brought us a new dawn
 chaahe rambhakti ho yaa rahimabhakti, jaruri yah he ki ham rashtrabhakti kii bhaavana ko majboot karen
 Harmony, unity and peace are very important for the development of the country
 ''haalanki, yahaan se aage badhate hue bhi, hamen bhoolanaa nahin chahie ki vah koun-se kaaran the jo hamen is dukhad mode par laae the kyonki ateet to hamaare saath rahegaa or ise apane vartmaan main baar-baar ghus aane se rokane kaa ekmaatr tarika yah he ki ise apni chetana se puri tarah se mitaa dene kaa prayaas na karen
 Instead, we should learn from it and use the understanding generated from it to move forward
 jaise, dharamshastra ke america professor louis bi
 Smids said, "forgiveness does not erase our bitter past
 swasth ho chuki smriti kaa matlab mitaa di gai smriti nahin he
 Rather, cultivating a feeling of forgiveness for someone who cannot be forgotten is a new way of remembering it
 ham apane ateet kii smriti ko bhavishya kii ummid main badal dete hai
 "so, what does this controversy and the decision on it teach us?" One thing is that, like any institution, ideology or individual, a nation cannot prosper for a long time with the help of any lie or wrong thing
 is galati kii sajaa milanaa sirf samay kii baat he
 Pakistan was separated from India on the basis of the erroneous logic that Hindus and Muslims cannot live together as equal citizens
 uske sansthaapakon ne dharm ko rashtriyata ke astitv kaa mul kaaran mana tha
 Nevertheless, barely 25 years after its formation, its eastern part was separated from it after a violent rebellion and Bangladesh was born
 raashtra ko ek saath baandhe rakhane ke liye dharm se kahin zyada majboot takat kii jarurat hoti he
 The history of the West also shows how religions divided countries and caused endless conflicts, instead of holding them together
 lekhak gore vidal kii tippanee he ki ''isa ke naam par maare gaye logon kii sankhya duniya main kisi or naam ke kaaran maare jane waalon se kahin zyada he
 The story of Lord Rama, whose supposed birthplace was a court battle, symbolizes this basic understanding
 ramayana ke ram apane samay ke dharm—adhikaron, kartavyon tathaa saamaajik uttardayitvon ke kathin sankul—kaa paalan karne ke liye nijee jivan main tyaag karte hai
 But, even while fighting the evils that Ravana symbolized, Rama admits that he is in a deep dilemma
 ravan ke saath yuddh ke charam par ram ne bhai lakshmana se kaha, ''bhai, ham jab is anjaani yatra par nikle the, tab main bhi bahut krodh or katutaa se bharaa tha
 But, in my journey up to Lanka, i have started to see that we have all received the gift of life from God and that being a good man is more important than just being a good Kshatriya
 kya ham sabhi ek hi strot se utpann nahin hai?rakshas, vanar, manushya, junglee jeev, hawa main udate pakshi or samudron kii machhliyaan? phir bhi hamamen se kuch log agyantavash apane hi saathi jeevon ke khilaaf dhanush or talwaar uthaate hai
 Many people have fallen on this battleground today and many more will die by the end of it
 ek kshatriya ke rup main main apane yuddh ladata rahoonga, lekin jab main mare logon kaa shavadah karuunga to main aise vishwa ke liye prarthana karuunga jisamen koi yuddh na ho or jahaan koi manushya apane hi bhai ke khilaaf gusse main haath na uthaae
 "many people of the country, including Prime Minister Modi, considered it an auspicious coincidence that the Supreme Court verdict was delivered on the same day that the Kartarpur corridor was inaugurated as part of Guru Nanak's 550th birth anniversary
" yah galiyara bhartiya tirthayatriyon ko pakistan sthit gurudwara kartarpur sahib tak sidhi pahunch detaa he or uskaa udghaatan donon deshon ke pradhanmantriyon ne kiya tha
 His main teachings to the founder of Sikhism are Ikk Onkar (god is one), Satinamu (the same name is Satya), Kata Purkhu (he is the Creator), Nirbhau (he is without fear), Nirvairu (who has no hatred from anyone), Famine Murti (he is timeless), Ajuni (he is beyond birth), is known by Sahibung (self-effaced)
 apane jeevankaal main sikh guru ne jab hinduon or musalamaanon ke bich badhata dharmik sangharsh dekha to unhone kaha, ''naa koi hindu / naa koi musalmaan / / sab rab de bande (koi hindu yaa musalmaan nahin he, ham sabhi bhagwaan ke log hai)
 "therefore, the way forward for both Hindus and Muslims is that both communities accept their mistakes and decide not to fall into the same trap again
" supreme court ne apane faisle main kaha bhi he ki yah gunatmak sakshya tha ki hindu samudaay 300 saal se adhik samay se us sthaan ko apane poojya devtaa kaa janmasthan maanata aayaa tha or us par uskaa aanshik kabja bhi tha, jiske ek hisse par babari masjid kaa kabja tha
 Over time, this site became as sacred to many Hindus as Mecca for Muslims
 is vivaad ke haath se nikal jane ke pehle kisi samay donon samudaayon ko mil kar kuch vaisaa hi sauhardpurn samaadhaan nikaalnaa chahie tha jaisaa adaalat ne tay kiya he: hindu sanghathanon ko us pavitra maane jane vaale sthaan par ram mandir banane diya jaataa or sampradayik sauhaard ke liye masjid ko samaapt kar ayodhya main ek parsparik sahmati ke kisi sthaan par sthanantarit kar diya jaataa
 Our failure to do so is a failure of both politics and civil society
 ram mandir ke pakshdhar hinduon ko bhi supreme court ke is kathan par dhyaan dena chahie ki 1949 main chori se masjid main ghuskar ramalala kii murti rakh dena tathaa sthaneey prashasan kaa isamen sahyog karnaa galat or masjid ko apavitra karne kaa kaam tha
 Also, in 1986, the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had done a partisan act by forcing the doors to be opened for the worship of the idol and later in 1989 it was wrong to allow Hindu organizations to lay the foundation stone for the Ram temple
 
 in samoohon ko adaalat kii us kathor bhashaa par bhi dhyaan dena chahie jisamen usne 1992 main babari masjid giraae jane kaa ullekh kiya he
 The court termed it as a "gross violation of the rule of law"
 haalanki, is gaiyr-kanoonee kaam main shaamil rahe sanghathanon or vyaktiyon ke liye apni galatiyon ko sweekaar karnaa kathin hoga
 We have to trust the judiciary to punish those guilty of this demolition, including some of the biggest leaders of the BJP, because it is the only way to show, especially to the Muslim community, someone Illegal workmen will be punished, no matter the person, the group or the reason for doing so
 nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa tathaa samvidhan kii raksha kii jaani he to kanoon ke shashan kii prabhutaa bhi sthapit kerani hi hogi
 Only the idea of india will be able to survive
 shubh lakshan yah he ki faisla aane ke baad desh bhar main shanti kaayam rahi or iskaa sanket he ki bharat ke log aage badaae ke liye taiyaar hai
 It should also be credited to Prime Minister Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat who warned Hindutva organizations and civil society to stay away from any kind of victory
 iskaa shrey muslim netaaon ko bhi jaataa he ki unamem se kai ne faisle se nakhushi ke baavjood apane samudaay se shanti banaae rakhane kii apil kii
 This is the spirit with which the country should move forward
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki sarvocch adaalat ne apane faisle main spasht rup se kaha he ki 1991 ke dharmasthal adhinium ke praavdhaanon kaa sabhi ko paalan karnaa chahie
 Through this act, the emphasis has been laid on maintaining the status of August 15, 1947 in all the shrines across the country, except the Ayodhya case which was under judicial consideration at that time
 yah varanasi or mathura main mandiron se satee masjidon ko sthanantarit karne ke liye aise hi andolan chalaane kii ichha paale rahe hindutvvaadi sanghathanon ko spasht chetavanee bhi he
 Significantly, Swami Vivekananda, one of the ideals of the Sangh Parivar, had said that religion alone cannot be the inevitable requirement of success of a nation
 khaali pet iskaa prachaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In the words of Swami Vivekananda, "whenever a religion is successful, it should also have an economic philosophy
" ek jaise hajaaron sampradaay ahmiyat paane ke liye sangharsh kar rahe honge, lekin vaastavik safalataa aarthik samasyaon ko puraa karne waalon ke paas hi hogi
 Human beings operate from the stomach
 vah chalata bhi he to pet pehle aata he or sir baad main
 "modi rightly appealed after the decision that India should focus on development and building a new nation
" arthvyavastha gambhir mandi kii chapet main he or logon ko is mushkil se baahar laane ke liye sarkaar or aam logon kii lakshyakendrit urjaaon kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 It is clear that we cannot afford to once again join the phase of religious power-show
 rashtrapita kii 150veen jayanti manaane ke is maukey par hamen dharm par mahatma gandhi ke vichaaron ko bhi yaad rakhana chahie
 He had said, "to me, religion is the only service to human service, or to serve mere living
 or, main aise dharm or raajnneeti ke bich koi antar nahin karata
 "gandhi had assumed Rama as the all-powerful essence, holding his name in the heart, eliminating all mental, moral and material suffering
" jab hatyare kii goli unhen lagi, to gir kar mrityu ko praapt hone se pehle unki antim aawaaj 'he ram!' thi
 As we move forward, this great nation will have to uphold the values and principles that were dear to Rama and the great men and constitution-makers of this country
 akele yahi baat yahaan raamarajy laaegi
 After all, what do we learn from the Ayodhya dispute and judgment? One is that no nation can achieve peace and prosperity for the long term on the basis of any falsehood or wrong act like any institution, ideology or person
 We should not forget the reasons that brought us to this sad point because our past Will be together hamen isse siikhnaa chahie or usase paidaa hui samaj kaa istemaal aage badaae main karnaa chahie

 pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ke saath phone kol ke dauraan france ne 'sanyam baratane tathaa sainya gatividhiyaan kam karne' kaa aahvaan kiya he, or jor dekar kaha he ki 'tanaav badha sakane vaale kadamon se dur rahanaa aavashyak he
 
 
 "after a phone conversation with France's European and Foreign Affairs Minister jean-yves Le Drian with his Pakistani counterpart, the French spokesman issued a statement saying," The two ministers raised the issue of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir

 "the statement said," France calls on both sides (india and Pakistan) to exercise restraint, reduce military activity, and normalize the situation
 
 
 tanaav badha sakane vaale kadamon se dur rahanaa aavashyak he
 
 
 "at the same time, the decision to remove Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir has been described by Bangladesh as an internal matter of India
 bangladesh ke videsh mantralay ne kaha he, "bangladesh is baat par kaayam he ki bharat sarkaar dwaara anuchhed 370 ko hataaya janaa bharat kaa aantarik maamla he
 
 
 Bangladesh has always advocated the vat as a principle that maintaining and maintaining regional peace and stability should be the priority of all countries
 
 
 " jahaan padosi desh bangladesh is faisle ko bharat kaa aantarik maamla qaraar de rahaa he, vahiin pakistan iskaa virodh kar rahaa he
 The Government of Pakistan said that it would take the matter to the ICJ
 china bhi iskaa virodh kar rahaa he, china is maamle ko yuanessi lekar gaya tha
