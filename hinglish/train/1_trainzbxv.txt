 The IPL franchise Rajasthan Royals removed Ajinkya Rahane from the captaincy and handed over the team's command to Australia's Steve Smith for the remaining matches of this season, and his decision has surprised the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)
 dakshin africa main pichley varsh hue sandpaper vivaad ke baad cricket australia (sie) ne kaha tha ki smith agle do varshon tak sabhi antarrashtriya or gharelu toornament main captaini nahin kar paaenge
 Smith had a one-year ban on playing cricket, which has now expired
 bisisiai ke adhikari ne mana ki board ne sie ke nirnay ko dhyaan main rakhkar david warner or smith ko IPL ke pichley sijan main khilne kii ijaajat nahin di thi
 Therefore, Rajasthan should have considered its decision before making Smith the captain
 ieenes se bisisiai ke ek adhikari ne kaha, 'prashaskon kii samiti (sioe) ne khilaadiyon par pratibandh lagane ke nirnay ko dhyaan main rakhkar unhen ipel ke pichley sanskaran main hissaa nahin lene diya tha
 So what happened to the ban imposed on his captaincy? Isn't that also a part of this decision? Or the ca's decision will be carried out only at its convenience
 sioe ko is maamle par sangyaan lenaa chahie or frenchiji ko uttar bhi dena hoga
 In the previous edition of the IPL, the COA, banning Smith and Warner, had said, 'BCCI acting president C
 ke khanna, ipel ke chairman rajeev shukla or kaaryvahak sachiv amitabh choudhary ke saath paraamarsh karne ke baad sioe ne smith or warner ke ipel 2018 main bhaag lene par tatkaal prabhaav se pratibandh lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 The BCCI hopes that the players participating in the IPL have the highest respect for the spirit of cricket and the code of conduct for players and match officials
 'khud ko batting ke liye neeche bheje jane par naakhush the rasel, haar ke baad nikaali bhadasbisisiai adhikari ne kaha, 'antarrashtriya cricket parishad (ICC) kaa samvidhan kahata he ki agar ek purna sadsy koi nirnay letaa he, to anya sadasyon ko bhi iskaa paalan karnaa chahie or isliye vibhinn deshon ne apane khilaadiyon ko isiel main khilne kii anumati nahin di kyonki bisisiai uskaa samarthan nahin karata tha
 Before the start of the match against Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals head of cricket Zubin Bharucha said, 'ajinkya is in the team and he will always be with the Royals
 unhone 2018 main chunauteepurn maahaul main team ko plaof main pahunchaaya tha
 He continues to be an important part of our team and leadership and will help Steve wherever he needs to
 'unhone kaha, 'steve sabhi praroopon main duniya ke sabase safal captainon main se ek hai
 We are confident that he can lead the Royals to success
 ' rahane ne is sijan ke aath maichon main ab tak 201 ran banaae hai, jisamen 70 unka sarvshereshth score he

 'ganguly further wrote,' The time has come to tell this story
 jab sachin ko pataa chalaa ki main agle din subah daudane nahin gaya to wo gusse main aag-babula ho gaya

 bispi pramukh mayawati ne lakhanu main dow
 B
 aar
 Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Mulayam were targeted during the rally organized on the death anniversary of Ambedkar
 mayawati ne bolaa ki akhilesh ne sabit kiya he ki wo babua hi he, kyonki wo har sabha main ye kah rahe hai park main jahaan hathi khadaa tha vahi khadaa he or baitha tha vahi baitha he
 His statement shows that he is now babu
 mayawati ne kaha ki meri sarkaar dwaara banaae gaye baba sahib ke ambedkar ke parkon main hajaaron kii sankhya main log aate the
 In our parks, tickets are charged, whose money goes to the government, Samajwadi Party wastes public money in Saifai Festival for the entertainment of their family, which makes no income
 maaya ne kaha ki notebandi ke bich baar-baar hamaara naam len, akhilesh yadav free main hamaara prachaar kar rahe he
 Mayawati said that the government of the Kissamwadi Party insults the great men and cancels holidays on their birth dates
 mayawati ne kaha kibi
 R
 ambedkarne samvidhan ko sabhi jatiyon ko barabari ke aadhaar baanta tha lekin bijepi or aresas desh par hindutv kaa agenda thopanaa chaah rahi he
 Maya said that i want to tell the Muslims that if they are safe in the whole country today, because of Baba Saheb
 mayawati boleen ki upi kii master kii daliton ke haath main ai uske baad hi daliton ko pichhado ke utthan kaa kaam hua, jabaki congress or bijepi kabhi bhi aisa nahin chaahati thi
 Attacking the Congress at the rally, it said that since independence, the Congress has never met the reservation quota of Dalits
 mayawati boleen ki daliton ke padonnati main aarakshan ke mudde ko bhi congress ne dabaane kii puri koshish kii thi, lekin basapa ne lagaataar sansad main congress par dabaav daalaa
 The Congress Party never conferred the Bharat Ratna on Baba Saheb, the recommendations of the Mandal Commission had to be canceled while the Congress was in place
 desh kii 90 fisadi janata ko kiya fakirmayawati ne kaha ki piem modi khud to fakir nahin he lekin desh kii 90 fisadi janata ko fakir bana diya he, notebandi kaa faisla bina taiyaari ke liye gaya
 Mayawati said that the BJP had already set up the black money of the capitalists, the BJP has sought details of bank accounts to throw dust in the eyes of the people
 satta main aane par karenge jaanchamayawati ne kaha ki jab ham satta main aaenge tab akhilesh sarkaar ke sabhi bade aarthik faislon kii jaanch karaayenge, doshi adhikariyon or netaaon ko jail bhejuungi
 We need an absolute majority government for this decision
 dilli kii jahrili aabhohawaa main kuch sudhaar ke liye od-ivan lagu karne ke iraade par NGT kii sharton ne pani pher diya
 The Kejriwal government has expressed its inability to comply with the conditions imposed by the NGT
 sarkaar ke mutabik uske paas itane sansaadhan nahin hai, jisase NGT kii in aath sharton par amal kiya ja sake
 Due to this, the government had to back down at the last moment with the decision of aud-even
 pehali shartengiti ne dilli sarkaar se kaha ki aap od-ivan beshak lagu karen, lekin isamen mahilaon ko koi chhot nahin di jaae
 Earlier, women in aud-even were excluded from this scope
 niyam lagu hoga to sab par, wo mahila ho yaa purush
 The second condition, NGT, asked to apply od-even on two-wheelers
 is par dilli ke parivahan mantri kailash gahalot ne tark diya ki dilli main 66 lakh tu-whealer hai, aise main agar 50 fisadi bike sadak se hatati hai to 3500 bas lani padengi, jo sambhav nahin he
 The third condition should also be applied on VVIP vehicles
 sienji vaahanon, ambulance or damakal jaisi apatkaaleen sevaaon ko hi od-ivan se chhot di jaae
 The fourth condition was the fourth condition of the NGT that whenever the level of PM10 was 500 and PM2 in the city
 5 kaa str 300 ke paar ho to dilli main khud ba khud od-ivan lagu ho jaae
 That is, whenever the level of pollution increases, aud-even is applied with immediate effect
 NGT ne itani deree se faisla lene par bhi sawaal uthaae
 The fifth winter season forecast rain in delhi-ncr in the next 48 hours
 agar barish nahin hoti he to kisi anya madhyam se pani kaa chhidkaav karana hoga
 That means spraying with helicopter
 chhathi shartadilli ke 300 kilometre ke daayre main chal rahe 13 thermal plant sulphate gas chhod rahe hai
 These PM10 and 2
 5 kaa str badha rahe hai
 To upgrade these, we direct the committee to report to us on this
 dilli or padosi rajya yah sunishchit karen ki agali sunwaayee tak vahaan koi nirmaan kaary na ho
 Give an action report about the seventh century and not burning stubble
 adhikaran ne saath hi kaha ki kisi bhi landphil site main aag na lagaai jaae
 If this happens, action will be taken against the officer concerned
 aathvin shartengiti ne poocha, kya pichley 2 din main petrol se chalane vaali 15 saal puraani yaa 10 saal puraani dijal kii ek bhi gaadi aapane uthaai he
 The tribunal said in its order, also check the traffic at the entry point
 in sharton ke alaava engiti nekejariwal sarkaarase kuch sawaal bhi puche
 For example, on the basis of which study, aud-even was implemented? - Did you get permission from Lt
 Governor on this? - Why did not apply Aud Even on the last 10 days? Is? - Has PM10 level ever been 100 in Delhi? Name any city where the level of PM-10 is below 100
 hamaare sabar kaa imtihaan mat lijieengiti ne is dauraan kaha ki dilli sarkaar or kendriya pudooshan niyantran board (CPCB) ko koi jaankaree hi nahin he
 The tribunal made a very strict comment and said, do not test our patience
 engiti ne saath hi poocha, 'od ivan lagu karne par apni manshaa bataaie
 Why didn't you apply Odd Even before the court order
 kya halaat sirf 5 din ke liye gambhir hue hai?'nhai or NBCC ko kaaran bataao noticerok ke baavjood jagah-jagah nirmaan kaary chal rahaa he
 NHAI is working on Akshardham
 ames ke saamne kidawai nagar main NBCC kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Angry, the NGT issued a show cause notice to the NHAI and NBCC and asked that you should not be sent to jail for non-compliance of the court order
 raaj thakare kii party maharashtra navnirmaan sena (emenes) ke netaa bala nandagaanvkar ne ravivaar shaam mumbai ke bandra sthit matoshri jaakar shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare se mulaakaat kii
 The meeting between the Shiv Sena and BJP over the seat-sharing for the BMC elections and the break-up in the BJP has raised speculation of an alliance between the two brothers Raj and Uddhav
 emenes pramukh raaj thakare ke kareebi nandagaanvkar or uddhav thakare ke bich kareeb 15 minute tak baatcheet hui
 According to sources, Nandgaonkar proposed an alliance between MNS and Shiv Sena in this meeting
 sutron ne saath hi bataaya kishivsena ke saath gathbandhanke liye emenes ne siton kii koi khaas maang nahin rakhi, bas mumbai main bijepi ko rokane ke liye sanyukt morche kii jarurat par jor diya
 However, political analysts say that the meeting of these brothers, who have been holding different paths for a long time, is now a bit late, as the work of filing nominations for BMC elections has already started
 ab bas itnaa ho saktaa he ki ye donon dal mumbai, thane, pune or nasik ke nikaay chunaavon ke liye ranneetik saajhedaari kar len
 On the other hand, sources say that MNS is willing to support the Shiv Sena in Mumbai and Thane, but in change it needs help in Nashik
 manase nasik nagarnigam kii satta he, lekin unase sabhi pramukh netaaon sahit aadhe se zyada parshadon se uskaa saath chhod party kii chunaav ummiido ko maddhim kar diya hai
 On the other hand, BJP is hammering the civic elections in other cities including Mumbai
 aise main manase or shivasena ke bich gathjod kii koshish ko bade terning point kii tarah dekha ja rahaa he
 This pair of Thackeray brothers can present serious challenges to the BJP
 haalanki shivasena ne manase ke is ofer par abhi koi jawaab nahin diya he
 US Defense Minister Leon Pennetta said the terrorist organization Al Qaeda still represents the biggest threat the country faces in the world
 tippaniyan "we have greatly weakened their ability to command, control and plan necessary for the September 11 attack on the country," Peneta said
 iske baavjood vah hamaare desh ke liye khatra bana hua he
 i believe that it represents the greatest danger that our country faces in the world
 afghanistan main apni aghoshit yatra samaapt karne vaale paneta ne kaha ki america alqaida or uske network ko nishaanaa bananaa jari rakhega
 He said, we have to continue chasing Al Qaeda no matter where it is
 hamen yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki unhen chupane ke liye koi sthaan nahin mili
 This is because we should not forget that the main purpose of Al Qaeda is to attack America, we will not allow this to happen again
 yadi ham unhen aisa nahin karne dena chaahate hai to hamen unka yaman, somalia or haa jaruri hone par mali main bhi peechha karnaa hoga

 It is impossible not to understand any woman
 is kahawat ko dam is baat se bhi miltaa he ki bahut si aisi baaten he jo mahilaayein purushon ko nahin bataati
 Now the question arises, why do women do this? There can be many reasons for this in you and our minds
 par sach yah he ki mahilaayein apni baaten isliye nahin chhupaati ki vah darati he balki isliye ki vah in baton ko sirf khud tak rakhana pasand karti hai, or to or mahilaon ke liye vah samay garv kaa hota he jab unki baton ko koi bina kahe samaj jaye
 Now consider these things, you will also feel that you do not really know everything about your partner
 aadatenladakiyon kii kuch aadaten hoti hai jo vah ladako ko bataanaa pasand nahi karti jaise unhen cockroach se dar lagata he lekin garm vaix se nahin ghabraatin
 Refuses to eat in front of everyone but eats fiercely in private
 jisko sabase zyada critisise karegi usee ko zyada maanati hai
 Prem Prasangalarki tells nothing about his past life to the current boyfriend because a lot of girls are afraid of getting fingered on their character
 kuch ladkiyaan yah mahasoos karti hai ki unke puraane rishtein ke bare main jaanakar unke partner ko acha nahi lagegaa, jalan hogi yaa unki koi baat rishte main dooriyaan naa paidaa kar den
 Makeup Kit Most women do not want to tell men about their makeup kit
 vah hameshaa apni sundarataa se purushon ko sarprise karnaa chaahati he lekin vah yah nahi bataanaa chaahati ki yah sundarataa mechap kaa kamaal he
 Women of talk do not tell anyone about the scope of their talk, especially men
 kuch mahilaon kaa kahana he ki vah apane doston kaa koi bhi rahasy apane partner ko nahin bataati hai kyonki unke anusaar iskaa unke sambandhon se kuch lenaa-dena nahin he, or agar vah bhul se bataa bhi detii he to isse unki nijee jindagi main bhi mushkilen aa sakati hai
 In a case where hundreds of people are arrested, there are so many absconders, thousands of people have been accused, and all of them are surrounded by allegations ranging from state governor to college professor, doctor, and peon-driver, is it just a government system Is a case of failure? isamen andeh nahin ki vyaapman ghotaalaa madhya pradesh ke jarjar or bhrasht ho chuke sarkari tantra kii kokh se niklaa he or isaki vajah se un bahut saare naujavaanon kaa bhavishya andhere main duba he, jo apni mehnat or eemaandaaree par bharosa karke naakaam imtihaan dete rahe honge
 But Vyapam is not so full
 vah bharat ke khate-pite middle class ke bheetar kii sadaandh kaa aainaa bhi he- upar se koob chamakta-damakata, mehnat or pratibha kii baat karata yah madhyavarg dhire-dhire paise ko sabase badi chiz maanane laga he or iske liye har tarah ke dhattakaram karne ko taiyaar he
 He teaches the art of bribe to his unworthy children and ensures them to return to this bribe by making them doctors, engineers
 is middle class ke liye acchhee posting kaa matlab gaanv-dehaat kii vah posting nahin he, jahaan uski zyaada zarurat he, balki bade shaharon or aarthik kendron kii vah malaaidaar posting he, jahaan sabase zyaada rishwatakhori kii gunjaaish he
 He does not have any moral dilemma in feeding and feeding, he does injustice and also tolerates
 vah khud ko deshbhakt bataata he, lekin aksar uski harakatein desh ko kamazor karne vaali sabit hoti hai, vah khud ko eemaandaar bataata he, lekin eemaandaaree ke har imtihaan main fail hota he
 Otherwise Vyapam does not include those capable and readable boys, who could pass the test on their own, but kept on passing other unacceptable people for the sake of money
 darasal, yah paakhand itnaa aam or saarvajanik he ki ab isse jude log sharminda tak nahin hote
 The comments ulte agar unhen sajaa ho jaae, budhaape main jail ho jaae, unka saarvajanik apmaan ho jaae, to dusron ko unase sahanubhuti hone lagati he
 The scandals appearing in the media in India are nothing compared to the great scandal that is going on at many levels in Indian society
 vyaapman ne bas nae sire se yah mauka sulabh karaayaa he ki ham is sadaandh ko pahachaanen or iske viruddh vaaki apane bheetar koi pratirodh paidaa karen
 There is no doubt that the Vyapam scam has come out of the womb of Madhya Pradesh's shabby and corrupt government machinery and because of this the future of many youths who have relied on their hard work and honesty will have failed the test
 lekin vyaapman itnaa bhar nahin he
 He is also a mirror of rot within the middle class of India's food-drinking middle class - talking about the brilliance, power, hard work and brilliance from above, this middle class has gradually started to consider money as the biggest thing and for this all kinds of dhatkaram Willing to do
 vah apane nalayak bacchon ko ghoose dene kii kala sikhaata he or unhen doctor, ejeeniyar banaakar unki sari umr is ghoose kii vaapasi ke liye sunishchit karaata he
 Good posting for this middle class does not mean the posting in the village-country where it is most needed, but rather the creamy posting in the big cities and economic centers where there is the most scope for bribery
 paise khaane-khilaane main use koi naitik duvidha nahin hoti, vah anyaay karata bhi he or sahataa bhi he
 He describes himself as a patriot, but often his actions prove to be a weakening of the country, he describes himself as honest, but fails in every test of honesty
 varanaa vyaapman main wo qaabil or padhane-likhane vaale ladke shaamil nahin hote, jo apane boote imtihaan paas kar sakate the, lekin rupayon kii khaatir duusare naqaabil logon ko paas karaane main lage rahe
 Actually, this hypocrisy is so common and public that people associated with it are not even embarrassed
 tippaniyan Conversely, if they are punished, imprisoned in old age, they are publicly insulted, then others start sympathizing with them
 bharat main media main dikhaai padane vaale ghotaale us mahaghotaale ke mukaable main kuch nahin hai, jo bhartiya samaaj main kai staron par chal rahaa he
 Vyapam has just made this new opportunity available to us to recognize this rot and really create resistance against it

 Controversy regarding pregnancy testadditional District Collector V
 en
 On Rai's oral order, the administration conducted a pregnancy test in an extremely objectionable manner for the 152 young women who attended the ceremony, most of whom belonged to the tribal community
 iske baad inamen se 138 mahilaon ko sarkaar se pryojit is yojana ke tahat 30 june ko vivaah kii ijaajat di gai
 The incident came to light at a mass wedding ceremony at the polytechnic in Sohagpur tehsil of the district
 vipaksh ko mila virodh kaa maukadarasal adhikansh jilon ke prashasnic adhikari vivaah yogya ladke or ladakiyon ke bare main jaankaree ekatra kar pataa kar lete hai ki pehle se vivaahit koi joda is yojana kaa laabh na uthaa sake
 But for this, the matter of any kind of medical examination was not revealed till now
 so, is ghatana ke saamne aane se vipaksh ko pradesh sarkaar ko gherne kaa mauka mil gaya
 The Congress has already raised this issue in the Rajya Sabha, while the mlas of the party on Tuesday created a lot of uproar in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly
 satta paksh or vipakshi sadasyon ke bich tikhi takaraar ke baad vidhansabha adhyaksh ishvardaas rohani ne is mudde par kisi tarah kii bahes karaane kaa aashwaasan dekar vipakshi sadasyon ko shant kiya
 While the Chief Minister dismissed the allegations, Congress National Secretary General Digvijay Singh insisted that the women were forced to undergo 'virginity tests', while Chauhan dismissed the allegation saying that it was a simple medical examination
 asal main congress kisi bhi tarah se kanyadan yojana ko, jisase chouhan ko bada rajnatik laabh hua he, badnaam karne kaa mauka nahin ganvaana chaahati
 On the other hand, Girija Vyas, head of the National Commission for Women, expressed dissatisfaction with the report of Shahdol Collector Neeraj Dubey from the state government
 police mukhyalay ne bhi alag se report bheji he or usne bhi ise saadhaaran chikitsakeey jaanch bataaya he
 But the Women's Commission is soon sending a team led by its member Yasmin Abrar to get to the bottom of the controversy
 prashasan kaa krity samvedanheenprashasan is aayojan ko lekar behad satarkta barat rahaa tha kyonki isi jile main 26 june ko hue samuhik vivaah samaaroh ke ain bich main ek mahila ko prasav pidaa shuru ho gai thi or baad main usne ek shishu ko janm bhi diya tha
 But the question arises that why women were physically tested instead of urine tests? This insensitive act of administration cannot be excused due to the simple technical reason that a pregnancy check does not necessarily confirm that the girl concerned is married or unmarried
 vivaad se uthe kai sawalpradesh congress samiti ke pravaktaa arvind malviya ne kaha, ''yadi koi avivaahit ladki garbhvatee ho or hone vaale bachche ke pita se vivaah karnaa chaahati ho tab kya hoga? kya prashasan uske prati bhedbhaav karegaa?'' aise samay jab chouhan atyant lokapriy ho chuki kanyadan yojana ko kanoonee jama pahanane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai, is vivaad ne unke liye asahaj sthiti paidaa kar di he

 On Wednesday, Sports Minister Ajay Maken broke out badly on the BCCI
 khel bill kaa virodh karne ke peeche unhone bisisiai samet sabhi khel sanghathanon par sawaal uthaae
 He specifically targeted the BCCI and asked what is the basis of opposition to the bill? Union Sports Minister Ajay Maken is angry with the Board of Control for Cricket in India
 cabinet main sports deveopment bill atakane ke baad maakan ne bisisiai par sawaalon kii jhadi laga di he
 Maken, who sought to bring BCCI under RTI, asked - like every sports federation directly or indirectly, BCCI also seeks help from the government
 kya bisisiai adhikari bataa sakate hai ki firozshah kotla maidan ke liye unhone kitni rakam chukaai he?- kya board adhikari bataa sakate hai ki dharmashala main khubasurat stadium banane ke liye jameen kii kitni keemat adaa kii?- bisisiai iskar or anya chhot bhi leti he
 Do they pay for police protection during matches? - Do they pay entertainment tax during matches? - If the bcci's functioning is transparent then why is it opposing this bill? Sending to represent, then how to avoid RTI? Ajay Maken also dismissed allegations that the Sports Ministry is trying to dominate sports organizations
 unhone kaha khel mantralay sirf khel sanghon ke kaamkaaj main paardarshita or kaarykushalta chahta he
 Significantly, in the cabinet on Tuesday, Sharad Pawar, Vilas Rao Deshmukh, Farooq Abdullah, Praful Patel and CP Joshi opposed the bill
 ye sabhi khel sanghathanon se bhi jude hai
 According to sources, Sharad Pawar objected to the anti-doping provisions of the bill and setting the age limit of the president of sports associations
 - prafull patel ne ye kehete hue bill kaa virodh kiya sab kuch sarkaar ke tahat laana thik nahin
 CP Joshi advocated the UK model where the government sets only guidelines for sports organizations
 kanoon nahin banaati
 However, despite these protests, according to sources, the Sports Ministry has made it clear that there will be no agreement on bringing the sports associations, including the BCCI, under the RTI, the age and tenure of the president of the sports associations

 aane vaale kuch samay main Jio bhi saste 4G smartphone ke saath bazaar main aa saktaa he
 Because people will want to adopt Jio only for more 4G data and unlimited calling for less money

 The ancient capital of Bihar, Pataliputra, has been the center of political upheaval since its rise
 patna ke puraane naam se mashhoor patliputra main kai rajwanshon ke bich siyaasi ladaaiiyaan huin or patliputra kai raajnneetik badlaav kaa gavaah bana rahaa
 But Pataliputra is ready to become the center of Bihar's politics once again in Loksabha Election 2019
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main patliputra loksabhaa seat ne jis raajnneetik ghamaasan kii vajah se puure desh kaa dhyaan khinchaa tha, is baar bhi aisa prathit ho rahaa he ki saakh or pagadi kii ladaai main phir patliputra bihar kii raajnneeti kaa kahin centre na ban jaae
 In the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, the way Pataliputra seat witnessed a political battle among the loved ones, this time also it seems that the same pair will be face to face in the political arena
 darasal, kabhi lalu prasad yadav ke rhite hand maane jane vaale ram kripal yadav ne bijepi ke tikat par chunaav lard rajd supremeo kii beti misa bharti ko patkhni di thi
 Before the Lok Sabha elections 2014, the name of Ram Kripal Yadav in Pataliputra seat was being decided by the RJD, but at the last time Lalu Prasad Yadav gave ticket to MISA India by not giving ticket to Ram Kripal Yadav, after which Ram Kripal Yadav rebel He got up and BJP took the opportunity and gave him a ticket and he won from Pataliputra and reached the Lok Sabha
 darasal, patliputra loksabhaa seat kaa itihaas zyada purana nahin he
 Because Pataliputra emerged as a Lok Sabha seat during the 2008 delimitation
 isse pehle tak patna shahar main maatr ek hi loksabhaa seat hua karti thi, jiskaa naam he- patna sahib
 Patna Sahib is considered to be the stronghold of Shatrughan Sinha
 yani ab patna shahar main do loksabhaa siten hai- ek patna sahib or doosraa patliputra
 Pataliputra Lok Sabha seat is believed to have more vote bank of Bhumihar, Yadav and Muslim
 saal 2009 main patliputra loksabhaa seat par pehali baar chunaav hue
 In the first electoral arena of Pataliputra, on one side there was RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav, on the other side, Ranjan Prasad Yadav, leader of Janata Dal United
 patliputra loksabhaa seat par hue pehle mukaable main hi bada ulatpher ho gaya or jadyu ke ranjan prasad yadav ne lalu prasad ko patkhni dekar sabko hairaan kar diya
 Ranjan Prasad Yadav defeated Lalu Prasad Yadav by over 23 thousand votes and put a big question mark on the stature of Lalu Prasad Yadav
 ab baari thi saal 2014 kii
 This time RJD fielded his daughter Misa Bharti from the Pataliputra seat, not Ram Kripal Yadav, the veteran leader of his party and the wazir of Lalu Prasad Yadav
 ram kripal yadav lalu prasad yadav ke is faisle se naaraaz hue
 He opposed this decision and adopted a rebel attitude
 patliputra se tikat na milane se naaraaz ram kripal yadav ne bijepi kaa daaman thama or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main hi apni 'bhatiji' or lalu prasad yadav kii beti misa bharti ko haraa diya
 Ram Kripal Yadav, who contested on the Bharatiya Janata Party ticket in the Lok Sabha elections 2014, defeated Misa Bharti by nearly 40 thousand votes
 chunaav se pehle aisa mana ja rahaa tha ki ram kripal yadav bijepi main jaakar or patliputra se lalu yadav kii beti ke khilaaf chunaav ladakar apane pair par kulhadi maar rahe hai
 But in 2014, he surprised everyone by defeating Lalu Prasad Yadav's daughter Misa Bharti
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ne bhi rajd ko yahaan se haraane ke badale unhen inaam se nawaja
 Bezip, who wanted to make a dent in the RJD, rewarded Ramkripal Yadav with victory and got a place in the Union Cabinet
 ab 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main ab tak jo tasviir saamne ai he, usase saaf he ki is baar bhi patliputra loksabhaa seat se rajd kii ore se misa bharti or bhaajapa kii ore se ram kripal yadav ke bich hi muqabla hoga
 Since the defeat, there were also reports that Misa Bharti cannot contest from Pataliputra, but the way her brother Tej Pratap Yadav is claiming that Misa Bharti will contest from Pataliputra, it is now believed that Misa Bharti will once again get down with the intention of defeating her uncle in a political battle

 Interestingly, Nand Ram Bagdi's daughter Sushila has been a BJP ticket councilor 2 times, but recently Manoj Tiwari's announcement of not giving tickets to current councilors and their relatives has led Nandram Bagdi to go to Aam Aadmi Party Is forced
 haalanki aam aadmi party ke liye bijepi se aae netaaon ko samahit karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 The party has declared its candidates on many seats, in such a situation, it can no longer give tickets to many BJP leaders and if it does, then it is afraid of the displeasure of its own leaders

 People of the area are congratulating Nand Ram by wearing garlands
 nand ram ke mutabik ward 47N main 50 hajaar se zyada voter hai or khaas taur se pichde varg main unki pakad zyada he
 On the question of leaving the BJP, Nand Ram said that 'humiliation of the workers was the biggest reason that we had to come to the Aam Aadmi Party

 An attempt to find a buyer for the debt-ridden Deccan Chargers failed as the IPL franchise rejected the sole bid
 isse is frenchiji kaa bhavishya adhar main latak gaya he
 Deccan Chronicle Holdings, the owner of Deccan Chargers, received a bid of Rs 900 crore from PVP Venture Capitals, a company that funds urban infrastructure development and films in Hyderabad, according to reports
 deccan ne haalanki ise khaarij karne kaa haroonges faisla kiya
 He found the price and conditions unacceptable
 ab bisisiai ko 15 sitambar ko hone vaali kaarysmiti kii baithak main chargers ke bhavishya par faisla lenaa hoga
 BCCI President n Srinivasan said, "the price and payment terms were not acceptable to Deccan Chargers
 bisisiai ne deccan chargers kii madad kii or hamane aharta ke mandandon par bhi gaur kiya ki ve sahi hai yaa nahin
 He said, 'we felt it was acceptable to us
 uske baad maamla deccan chargers or boli lagane vaale ke bich kaa tha
 The board was not involved in that
 chargers ne hamen bataaya ki keemat or sharten unhen sweekaarya nahin he
 Asked if a new tender will be issued, Srinivasan said, "it will be up to Deccan Chargers as they are the ones to decide
" bisisiai ne kuch baton par frenchiji se spashtikaran maanga he
 We have given them time but it is a matter between the board and the Chargers
 ’bisisiai ne baad main press vijyapti jari karke kaha ki chargers ke boli radd karne main bisisiai kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 Board Secretary Sanjay Jagdale said, “the bid received by Deccan Chronicle Holdings Limited met the eligibility criteria of BCCI
 baad main deccan cranical holdings limited ne boli kii samiksha kii or boli khaarij kar di
 The board has no role in this
 ’jagadale ne kaha, ‘deccan chronical holdings limited ne bisisiai kii chhatrachhaaya main nivida chah sitambar 2012 ko jari kii thi jisaki miyaad guuruuvaar ko mumbai ucch nyaayalay dwaara niyukt shri norwekar kii nigaraanee main khatm ho gai
 a top board official indicated that the Chargers' contract could be canceled after a working committee meeting
 iske baad nayaa tender jari kiya ja saktaa he
 There is also a possibility that the team will be sold to the PVP company
 board ke ek anya sheersh adhikari ne hairaani jataai ki 900 karod rupaye kii boli kaise khaarij kar di gai
 He said, 'we wonder how the bid of Rs 900 crores was rejected
 hamen laga ki vittiya boj tale dabi company ke liye yah prastaav acha tha
 We feel that at the behest of banks, they have rejected this proposal
 ’bisisiai kaa aglaa kadam kya hoga, par adhikari ne kaha, ‘hamen 15 sitambar paanch baje tak intjaar karnaa hoga jab deccan chargers ko di gayi ek maheene kii samaysima samaapt hogi
 If he does not pay the salary of the players, then surely he will have to struggle to preserve his existence
 kisi bhi sthiti main unhone bisisiai kii sampatti (ipel team) ko bank main girvee rakhkar bahut galat kaam kiya
 According to the IPL constitution, the BCCI has the right to redeem the amount of the bank guarantee and to pay the players salaries from it
 jab kochi taskars kerala ko bhang kiya gaya to tab bhi bisisiai ne bank guarantee raashi bhunaayi thi
 Deccan Chronicle Holdings bought the Hyderabad franchise in 2008 for Rs 428 crore
 nilaamee main mul keemat lagbhag 750 karod rupee rakhi gayi thi
 The winning company must meet the BCCI eligibility and other qualifications
 yah pehla avasar he jabaki ipel kii puri frenchiji hi maalik ne bikri ke liye rakh di he

 Let me breathe all the time! And the boy started crying
 'kuch isi tarah kishor choudhary kii kitaab 'dhoop ke aaine main' mohabbat se uktaae logon kii mohabbat main dub jane kii hasarat kaa bayaan he
 a meaningless journey to discover the scent of wild bells in the grass of the terrace garden
 'dhoop ke aaine main' mukhya rup se shahari madhyavarg ke jawan 'mohabbatiyon' kii kahaniyaan hai
 Kishore has threaded the story, taking the context of today
 kul jamaa chah kahaniyaan hai
 Everyone's central theme in this book is love
 prem main jindagi bitaa dene ko patibaddh log kaise praathamiktaayen badalte hi prem ko biit jane dete hai or phir hairankul ho kar sochate hai ishk gaya kahaan rakhaa to tha sabase bhitari jeb main surakshit
 In fact, love is like a fickle child, as long as you keep cuddling in your lap, then you will be happy with the furnishings of happiness, but as soon as you take off from the lap, you will start lying on the ground and make you embarrassed
 kishor apane paatro ke jariye yahi kehete hai
 Although reading the book many times, it seems that a philosopher has been lost in philosophy while narrating his love story
 kishor bhi kai baar upamaaon or shabd chamatkaar ke pher main ulajhate hai lekin turant laut bhi aate hai
 What does the story say, at the level of storytelling, you will not get anything unique or new, but when do you want a new one
 aapane to use hi makabool kiya he jo aapaki baat kah sake
 The teenagers have been successful in saying the middle class urban youth
 sangrah kii sarvshereshth kahani he ye tanhai kisi he
 The dryness served by the plot of the story is wonderful
 'dhoop ke aaine main' ek khubasurat blog jaisaa kuch he, kahani main kavita sa pravaah
 Chori Kamali is wrapped in the fragrance of the dholes of the desert
 is kahani se guzarane kaa man karata he magar anjaam kii jaldi nahin hoti
 The result of the story is also a bit weak
 march kii ek subah prem main march si taazgi nahin balki june kii dopaher si khij he
 The love story has all but love and that's why the story gets better
 vaise bhi aaj ke daur main kitna prem batch paaya he premiyon main
 That is mine is yours
 
 
 kahani aasapaas kii he
 The image examples are all from the listened to, so the relationship immediately connects to the story
 lagata he jaise apni hi baat ho rahi ho
 The author simply shows a mirror and does not shed knowledge
 ham prem kahaniyon par mahaan hone kii shart lad dete hai jabaki prem ham-aap jaise praani hi to karte hai
 With his Iago, trickery and infidelity
 mahanata se samanta kaa bhav nahin aata
 But comes by reading this book
 paatr hamaari hi tarah dare hue hai
 ejhar-e-mohabbat agrees and later curses himself to say how much is left
 kamajori agar kahi jaae to lekhak bhi thodaa daraa hua lagata he
 Chacha Ghalib would have been better off walking on the banks of this 'dariya-e-aag', the teenagers would dip in it and take us to the deep bottom where the soil is sitting
 kyonki upar-upar se jhaadne-ponchney main mohabbat kii gard bahut jamaa ho gai he
 Why read 'in the mirror of incense' if you have not read anything on love for a long time
 dil ko rumaniyat kii khuraaq deni ho to 'dhoop ke aaine main' ko pard aapke seene main mohabbat kii thandak paidaa hogi
 Kishore Chaudhary has written our words and is a mention of love
 jab aap ise padhenge to aapako apane afsane bhi yaad aaenge
 Why not read if you are looking for cure-e-ishq or want to go to Ishq like refuge, then do not bother to read this book
 faij ne apni najm main kaha bhi to he,' or bhi gam hai jamaane main, mohabbat ke sivaa
 'so if you too have more sorrows of life, and love makes you feel worthless, then don't read this book

 Whenever the opposition tries to surround the government on any issues, only Anil Vij is pushed forward
 iske saath hi varishthata main bhi anil vij sabase senior vidhayak hai

 Along with him another minister was also removed from the post of minister
 lekin ghanashyam sarraf wo duusare mantri hai jo anil vij kii hi tarah jeet kar aae hai
 In such a situation, his seat is also considered to be fixed
 kyonki in donon mantriyon ke alaava anya tamaam mantri apane-apane ilaakon se chunaav haar gaye hai

 But the 'last published text' of the ten stories of the collection forms the bench of interesting study

 The narrative presentation of the restless stories is the basic concept of how the dynastic social structure marginalized the Dalits and provided a concrete settlement that the inequality-based structure remains intact

 Their goal is to serve their own interests

 madhyapradesh main 15 saal baad satta main lauti congress kii kamalnath sarkaar ne apana pehla purna bajet pesh kar diya he
 In the budget of more than 2 lakh crores, the fiscal deficit is estimated at 32,106 crores
 sarkaar ne is bajet main jal adhikaar adhinium or nadi purnjivan kaarykram kii baat bhi kahi he, khaas baat ye he ki bajet main koi nayaa kar nahin lagaaya gaya he
 In this budget, the government plans to revive 40 rivers, including Kanha of Indore, branding of Jalebi and Namkeen, e-rickshaw scheme for women, Rs 2500 crore for MNREGA, lease to the houseless, special to the haat-bazaar for tribals Has mentioned many things like ATM, 100 unit electricity bill hundred rupees
 lekin ek ore sarkaarka khaas dhyaan dikhataa he, jaise haj cameti kaa anudaan badhanaa, mandir kii jameenon ko sarkari nidhi se viksit karne kaa faisla, 1000 gau shaalaaon ke liye 132 karod rupee, govansh par puraani gaushala main har din 20 rupee, pujaariyon ke maandey main teen guna ijapha, pujari kalyaan kosh math mandir salaahkaar samiti kaa nirmaan, ramvangaman path ke anchalon ke vikaas ke liye praavdhaan jaisi baaten kahin jisase congress ke soft hindutv kii chhap madhya pradesh main camel nath ke pehle bajet main dikhaai di, lekin sarkaar ko aisa nahin lagata

 is bajet main sabakaa dhyaan kisaanon ke liye aavanton par tha, krishi yojanaon ke liye 22,736 karod kaa bajet aavantit kiya gaya
 The government said that in the first phase, the loan of 20 lakh farmers was waived of 7000 crores, for the second phase, a provision of 8000 crores is proposed, although about 48,000 crores have to be spent on loan waiver of more than 50 lakh farmers, but the treasurer says, right now Total debt was not added
 bhanot ne kaha hamane duusare charan main 8000 karod karjamaafee ke liye rakhaa he lekin jo lagegaa kharch karenge
 However, when he was asked how much money would be charged, he said that the figure has not come yet, someone tells 48000 crore rupees
 vahiin bijepi vidhayak or purv sahakaarita mantri vishwaas saarang ne kaha ki ye daawa thonkate the, kehete the hamaari flagship yojana he
 Whether there was no provision in the budget for loan waiver of farmers or giving employment, the budget speech was only like Kavi Sammelan and Mushaira

 Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargava said that when the notification of the assembly session was issued on June 7, then taxing the week before, taxing diesel and petrol, you amended the stamp duty, all these things should be included in the budget speech, if If done, the notification was to be put on the table, the entire rights of the MLA and the legislature have been violated, this is a wrong tradition

 According to an open poll conducted by india-today Karvy from March 17 to April 15 for all 224 seats in Karnataka, the Congress is going to win 90 to 101 seats
 opinian pole kaa anumaan he ki congress ko 2013 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main 37% vot share jitna hi vot share is baar bhi milane ja rahaa he
 Despite this, the Congress will be missing some seats from the magic figure of 113 seats required for majority in the state

 kareeb ek dashak pehle bharat main dijal kaaron ke aagaman kaa jabardast swaagat kiya gaya tha
 State-of-the-art and advanced diesel locomotives arriving in India from Europe due to such features as power and economy had changed the entire world of the Indian car market
 dijal eendhan kifayati hone or isse dijal kaaron kii badhati lokapriyata kii vajah se bharat ke amuman sabhi car utpaadakon kaa nayaa mantra ban gaya- dijal apanaao, bikri badhaao
 All companies were vying to launch diesel variants of different models of cars, but after a decade, the color of diesel cars has faded
 kai samasyaon kii vajah se ab companiyaan dijal kaaron yaa esayuvi jaise anya dijal vaahanon se dur ja rahi hai
 Maruti has declared that it will not produce diesel cars from 1 April 2020
 dijal car model zyada rakhane vaali mahindra and mahindra bhi ab samooche range main petrol ingine laane par vichaar kar rahi he
 Tata Motors is also considering reducing the diesel model
 isliye sawaal uthta he ki aakhir dijal kaaron ke saath samasya kya he? jaanate hai vistaar se
 
 
 The phenomenon of the difference between the price of diesel and petrol began to come in India about a decade ago and models of diesel cars were covered
 takat or kifayat jaisi visheshtaon kii vajah se europe se bharat aane vaale atyaadhunik or unnat dijal injanon ne bhartiya car bazaar kii puri duniya hi badal di thi
 Due to these characteristics, diesel engine cars in Europe had occupied more than fifty percent of the market
 indian express ke anusaar saal 2012-13 tak bharat main bhi paisanger whical ke 48 fisadi hisse par dijal whical kaa kabja ho chukaa tha
 Due to the difference in the price of petrol and diesel by Rs 25 per liter then, the sale of diesel cars was increasing
 lekin saal 2014 main eendhan kii keemton par sarkari niyantran khatm hote hi tasviir badalane lagi
 The difference between the prices of petrol and diesel continued to decrease
 ab to dijal or petrol kii keemat main kareeb 7 rupee prati litre kaa hi antar rah gaya he
 Due to this, sales of diesel cars also started to decline
 saal 2018-19 main kul paisanger whical main dijal whical kaa hissaa ghatakar 22 fisadi tak aa gaya
 Awareness on pollution and changes in emission standards is a major reason for Maruti to stop production of diesel cars, the country's new emission standard Bharat Stage-6 (BS-VI) which is to come into force from April 1, 2020
 dijal injanon ko is maanak ke anuroop banane ke liye companiyon ko baari kharch karnaa hoga or unke liye munafa kamanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Therefore, it seems appropriate for him to get out of diesel
 bharat utsarjan ke maamle main jo maanak BS-VI lagu karne ja rahaa he, us str kaa maanak europe main paanch saal pehle hi lagu ho chukaa he
 Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has committed that the new standard will be implemented from 1 April 2020
 desh bhar main dijal vaahanon se lekar hone vaale pradooshan par jaagrurata bad rahi he or prashasan sakht nirnay le rahaa he
 After the Supreme Court order, entry of diesel trucks older than 10 years in Delhi has been banned and diesel vehicles older than 10 years cannot be sold
 samay bahut kamdesh main bies-4 maanak ko saal 2017 main lagu kiya gaya tha or sarkaar ne nirnay liya ki bies-5 nahin balki ab sidhe bies-6 maanak ko lagu kiya jayega or vah bhi april 2020 se
 This means that the new standard has received only three years, while the BS-4 standard also took seven years to be implemented across the country
 yani nae maanak ko lagu karne ke liye samay behad kam mila he or tel companiyon tathaa auto companiyon, donon ke liye ise samay se lagu kar paanaa kaaphi mushkil he
 Changing pattern around the world, which was once dominated by diesel vehicles in Europe, which was once the world's largest market for diesel cars, now their popularity is also decreasing
 european union main dijal kaaron kii bazaar hissedari saal 2016 ke 49
 Decreased to just 44 in the year 2017 against 9%
 8 fisadi rah gai
 The share of diesel cars in Germany, the world's leading car companies like Volkswagen and BMW, is just 31 in the first half of 2018
 1 fisadi rah gai, jo ek saal pehle kii samaan avadhi main 41
 Was 3 percent
 berlin, landan, paris jaise pramukh europea shaharon main dijal kaaron main bain ke kaarykram shuru ho gaye hai
 a big scandal surfaced in 2015, with Volkswagen admitting that it had defrauded its claims of adhering to the emission standard
 porce, toyota, mitsubishi jaisi companiyaan europe main dijal kaaren bechnaa band kar chuki hai
 It is almost seven in the evening

 For him, Morne Morkel took two wickets for 35 runs, but his off-spinner Sunil Narine (1 for 18) and left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan (1 wicket for 21) played a key role in curbing the batsmen

 Mumbai missed another spinner

 Harbhajan's boundary at the mid-off or two boundaries imposed on Jaspreet Bamrah was balanced

 Gambhir was definitely under pressure to score runs and in such a situation, he played Harbhajan's ball on his wickets, but Uthappa maintained his good form
 unhone 33 gendon par aath chaukon or ek chakke kii madad se ardhashatak puraa kiya
 Harbhajan bowled Manish Pandey (14 off 21 balls) in his last over to take his second wicket, but Uthappa continued to bat strategically from the other side

 raidu ne iske baad strike rotate karne par dhyaan diya, lekin duusare chor par rohit ran banane ke liye jujh rahe the
 This put pressure on Rayudu to run fast and he played Chawla for a long shot which was caught on long on

 Amid reports that Priyanka Gandhi shared the publicity obligations with her brother Rahul Gandhi, Congress General Secretary Madhusudan Mistry said that if Priyanka comes to campaign for him in Vadodara, he will be 'grateful' to her
 mistre vadodara loksabhaa seat par bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahe hai
 Mistry told PTI, if she (priyanka) comes, i will be very happy
 
 
 yadi vah ek road sho karne aati hai, to main abhaari rahoonga
 His remarks came amid reports that Congress strategist Sam Pitroda was quoted as saying that Priyanka would share the weight of her brother and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi
 pitroda ne kaha he ki vah media se or mukhaatib hongi tathaa aagaamee dinon main tufaani prachaar bhi karengi
 Mistry's remarks came a day after All India Mahila Congress (AIMC) President Shobha Ojha said in Bhopal that all Congressmen want Priyanka to campaign for the party across the country
 yah puche jane par ki kya eiemasi chaahati he ki priyanka apane parivaar ke nirvachan kshetron amethi or raibareli tak simit rahane kii bajaay samooche desh main prachaar karen, shobhaa ne kaha tha, yah sabhi congressiyon kii ichha he
 Shobha has said, however, that any final decision on the issue will be entirely hers
 khabaren in charchaaon ke bich ai hai ki congress ke 'waar room' main prachaar abhiyaan kii ranneeti banane main madad kar raheen priyanka gandhi raajnneeti main or adhik sakriy bhoomika nibhaane kii ore kadam badha sakati hai
 Before filing the nomination, Mistry said that he was confident of winning in Vadodara because of the solid support of the party and the people
 modi ke mukhar aalochak mistre ne kaha, mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki main sameekaran badal duungaa
 Asked whether the Congress would field a strong candidate against Modi in Benares, Mistry, the in-charge of party affairs in Uttar Pradesh, said, of course
 is sawaal par ki banaras main congress kaa ummidavaar koun hoga or kab uske naam kii ghoshnaa kii jaaegi, mistre ne kaha, main vadodara main chunaav prachaar main vyast hum
 Priyanka's possible debut in active politics is being seen in the wake of statements by senior Congress leader Janardan Dwivedi, in which she quoted the late Rajiv Gandhi as saying that Priyanka had an inclination towards politics from a young age
 yah puche jane par ki kya priyanka ab congress ke raajnneetik maamalon main zyada ruchi le rahi hai, dvivedi ne kaha tha, mere liye yah sawaal bekaar he
 As far as i know, his interest in politics started long ago
 vah bahut pehle se hi raajnneetik ghatnakramon or raajnneeti kii bhashaa ko samajhane ke liye utsuk rahati thim
 He said, i have some evidence of this too, but i do not want to mention it right now

 One session of Sahitya Aaj Tak 2019 was named after patriotism and patriotism
 satr 'ye desh he vir javaanon kaa' vir ras ke kaviyon ne deshprem ke geet gaakar samaa baandh diya
 Together on the stage were poet Hariom Panwar, poet Vineet Chauhan, poet Colonel VP Singh and poet Dr
 rahul avasthi aae to raashtra ke liye qurbaaniyaan dene vaale shaheedon ko geet-kavitaaon ke jariye yaad kiya gaya
 Inaugurating the poems of Veer Ras, Rahul Awasthi is loving his poetry, this country is ours
 
 
 sunai to puraa haul taaliyon ke gadgadaahat se gunj uthaa
 Through this poem, the poet has given a supernatural description of India's identity, philosophy and geographical location
 kashmir par tathakthith buddhijiviyon ko karaara jawaab dete hue kavi vineet chouhan ne kavita sunaate hue kaha kisbaki aisi-tesi kar di
 
 
 Some patriotic mantras have gone there and we have reached, we have climbed on the fan of the poison of treason, we have defied the fury of terrorism, but it is slow to hit its mouth on the right slap
 lo hamane dum sidhi kar di un aatanki aakaaon kii,jo uchhal rahe the aad liye in algavi netaaon kii,jin logon ne samvidhan raddi akhbaar bana daalaa,kashmir ko patharbaji kaa bazaar bana daalaa
 His senseless whereabouts were carried by his own cleverness, his fat brother did such a thing
 ye to chota sa trailor he ab aage ko taiyaar raho,sau hoor tumhaari jananath main sab kar lengi satkar kaho,vishwaas rakho is baar sabhi ye nir-kheer ho jayega,sindhu tat ke aar-paas sab kashmir ho jayega
 See the full coverage of Sahitya Aaj Tak here
 Kavi Kavi on the stage and Colonel VP Singh, who served the nation during the Kargil War, said, "I have given 30 years of my life to protect the borders of the country
" iske baad unhone bharat ke vir sipaahi kaa parichay dete hue ek kavita logon ke saamne prastut kii
 In this poem, he mentioned the courage of the brave soldiers and the nefarious antics of neighboring Pakistan
 karnal veepi singh ne hindu-muslim ekta par ek damdaar kavita sunai jiske baad darshakon ne khadey hokar unka abhivadan kiya
 Now my poem is dead
 
 
 aakhir main kavi hariom panvar ne ajtak ko dhanyavad dete hue sahitya ajtak ke mahamanch kaa samskruti or sahitya main ahm yogadan ke liye aabhaar jataayaa
 He recited his 29 years old poem related to 370 and Kashmir and said that i am reciting this poem for the last time and wanted this poem to die
 panvar ne kaha ki 5 agast ko anuchhed 370 hatate hi maine sansad main apni is kavita ko marate hue dekha he
 i am very happy with this decision
 panvar ne kaha ki 29 saal se yah kavita ga rahaa tha kuch nahin badla lekin ab badal gaya he or maine apni kavita main he kii jagah tha likh diya he
 He said that i had been expressing my anger for almost 3 decades
 hariom panvar ne kargil ke shaheedon par bhi ek kavita sunai jisane puure pandal ko bhavbhivor kar diya
 India is the largest democratic structure in the world, elections are going on everywhere in the country
 yahi vajah he ki kai baar vibhinn chunaav ek saath karwaae jate hai
 It is allowed in the constitution of the country that the Election Commission, according to its convenience, can conduct the elections 'ahead of time'
 aagaamee chunaav kii khabaron par vishwaas karen to agle saal ke ant main hone vaale chaar rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke saath hi saath 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav bhi karwaae ja sakate hai
 According to the news published in the Times of India, the possibility of holding assembly elections with the Lok Sabha in more and more states has started to be discussed
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki iske chalate agle loksabhaa chunaav saal ke antim do maheenon (november-disambar 2018) main karwaae ja sakate hai
 Prime Minister Modi has also expressed his opinion many times that successive assembly elections not only affect the functioning of the government but also puts an economic burden on the country
 purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne bhi kii thi vakalatpurv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne is saal ganatantr diwas kii purv sandhya par desh ko sambodhit karte samay bhi desh main chunaav sudhaaron kii vakaalat kii thi
 Pranab had asked the Election Commission to take forward the idea of holding both elections in consultation with political parties
 agar aisa hua to kai rajyon main ekasaath badalegi sarkarpradhanmantri or chunaav ayog kii apil agar tamaam raajnneetik dal maan lete hai or samaypurv loksabhaa chunaav par ve ekamat ho jate hai to kai rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav bhi ekasaath ho sakate hai
 Actually, the tenure of the legislative assemblies of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram ends in november-december 2018
 iske alaava telugana, andhra pradesh or odisha jaise rajyon main bhi vidhansabha chunaav in prastaavit chunaavon ke saath karwaae ja sakate hai
 The term of the Legislative Assembly of these states is till April 2019
 mana ja rahaa he ki agar is prakriya ko agle loksabhaa chunaavon se lagu kar diya jaae to 10 saal main zyaadaatar rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav loksabhaa ke saath hi honge
 It may be that the Modi wave has benefited from the functioning of the 4 Legislative Assembly (madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram) ending in november-december next year where Mizoram is the only one where BJP is not in power
 iske alaava odisha main bijedy or andhra pradesh main tidipi ko 2014 kii modi lahar kaa phayda jamkar hua tha
 Due to this, there is a high expectation that the 'premature' elections will be agreed in almost all the states
 The Modi government is also making a ruckus
 In view of the elections, the Modi government has also decided to make a strategic change in its working style
 company barkele india kii ek report main ye baat saamne ai he ki modi sarkaar apane bache kaarykaal main shaayad hi kisi mahatvapurn sudhaar par dhyaan de
