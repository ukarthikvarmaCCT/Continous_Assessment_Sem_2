 Government wants to increase the sales of RO: Raghav Chadhabole, sample also people of Paswan's party, the fight between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the central government, which is ruling the state's power in the national capital, Delhi, is going on
 aarope-pratyarope kii siyasat main aap netaa raghav chaddha bhi kud gaye hai
 Chadha on Friday targeted Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, accusing him of connivance with RO companies and demanded his resignation
 unhone kaha ki aaro companiyon paranyaaypalikane pratibandh lagaaya tha
 The National Green Tribunal (NGT) also said in its order that ros will not be allowed in areas where TDS is less than 500
 engiti ke is aadesh se aaro companiyaan ghabara gayi
 Chadha said that now this government wants to increase RO sales by creating fear in the minds of people of Delhi about drinking water
 isiilie biies kii report kaa hawala dekar yah dikhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he ki dilli kaa pani jaharila he
 Trying to save RO companies, he said that RO companies can be saved, hence it is being said repeatedly that the quality of water in Delhi is not good
 raghav ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki dilli main jin logon ke gharon se sample liye wo bhi paswan kii party ke logon ne hi ekatrit kiye
 Delhi has a population of two crore
 isamen sirf 11 sample bheje gaye
 Raghav alleged that the same companies are members of the Water Purification Committee, which makes RO
 isamen kent, hindustan uniliver samet chah companiyaan shaamil hai
 Creating the atmosphere before the hearing in the Supreme Court, Raghav accused the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Lok Janshakti Party of repeatedly talking about RO, saying that before the hearing in Kisuprim Court, this atmosphere was created that the water of Delhi has become poisonous
 aaro companiyon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye centre sarkaar main baithe kuch netaa kaam kar rahe hai
 He said that the RO companies presented the report during the court hearing
 raghav ne khadey kiye sawalap netaa raghav chaddha ne sawaalon ke tir bhi daage
 He asked Paswan and other ministers what has happened to your RO companies? Is an atmosphere being created in Delhi to benefit them personally? Are you working for their benefit? Chadha said that when such an investigation has not yet been done by BIS, then why was it done now

 bihar main swasthya suvidha khud 'biimaar' he
 Bihar, a large state with a population of 100 million, has just 6,830 doctors
 is hisaab se bihar main anupaat dekha jaae to har 17,685 logon ke hisse main ek doctor aata he
 If seen at the level of the nation, this ratio is that of a doctor at 11,097 people
 aisi sthiti main narendra modi sarkaar ne 2015 main bihar main duusare ol india istitute of medical sciensej (AIIMS) kii sthapana kaa elaan kiya to bihar main swasthya sevaaon ke kshetra main sudhaar aane kii ummid bani
 But after three years, the second AIIMS project in Bihar hangs in the balance
 india today ne soochna ke adhikaar (RTI) ke tahat bihar main ek or AIIMS kii sthapana or iske liye jagah ke chunaav ko lekar bharat sarkaar ke swasthya or parivaar kalyaan mantralay or bihar sarkaar ke bich hue patrachaar kii jaankaree jutai
 The important details of this correspondence are as follows - On June 1, 2015, Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda wrote a letter written by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar urging identification of suitable places for establishment of other AIIMS in the state
 nadda ne ye bhi chitthee main ingit kiya ki sambandhit jameen 200 acre ke kareeb honi chahie
 Also, there should be a facility of road connectivity and availability of water
 is chitthee ke saath ek sanlagnak (atachament) bhi tha jisamen saaf kiya gaya tha ki jameen kaa chunaav karte hue kin-kin maanakon ko puraa kiye jane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The Center sent two reminders, there was no response from the Bihar government, while two reminders were sent by the Union Health Ministry
 pehla 10 disambar 2015 ko or doosraa 6 may 2016 ko
 The reply was finally sent by the Bihar government on 3 August 2016
 isamen upyukt jagah kii pahchaan karne kii jagah bihar sarkaar ne kendriya swasthya mantralay se khud hi AIIMS kii jagah par nirnay lene ke liye kaha
 In response from the Bihar government, it was said that it will take steps in its own direction only after the center has chosen a suitable place
 bihar sarkaar ke jawaab par pratikriya dete hue kendriya swasthya or parivaar kalyaan mantralay ne 8 disambar 2016 ko phir chitthee bheji
 In this letter it was clearly written that 'identification of land is the primary responsibility of the state government for the establishment of new AIIMS
 rajya sarkaar kii ore se upyukt jameen ke liye 3-4 vikalp sujhana bhi jaruri he
 On 29 March 2017, the Bihar government again sent a letter, reiterating its stand and asking the Center to identify the place itself
 12 april 2017 or 2 farvari 2018 kokendriya swasthya or parivaar kalyaan mantralayane bihar sarkaar ko chitthee bhejkar phir rajya sarkaar kii ore se jagah kii pahchaan kiye jane kii jarurat ko doharaaya
 More recently, on 1 July 2018, Union Health Minister JP Nadda wrote another letter to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar saying that in the follow-up to the original letter, his ministry has sent five reminders
 dilachasp ye he ki is taaja chitthee ke ek haftaa bitne ke baad hi 9 july 2018 ko nadda ne bihar main beete ek dashak main swasthya ke kshetra main uplabdhiyon ke liye bihar sarkaar kii jamkar tarif kii
 Nadda said, 'bihar has made commendable progress on health front in the last 10 years
 ' ye baat duusari he ki nadda ye ullekh karnaa bhul gaye ki rajya main ek or AIIMS kii sthapana ko sambhav banane main bihar sarkaar naakaam rahi
 Double engine government means that if there is a government of allies in the state and at the center, then it is an ideal situation for rapid development
 ye vichaar 2015 bihar vidhansabha chunaav se pehle diya gaya tha
 At that time Nitish and BJP were on different paths
 lekin do saal baad nitish NDA main phir waapas aa gaye tab bihar main bijepi ke diggaj netaa maane jane vaale nand kishor yadav ne kaha tha, 'ab hamaare paas dabl ingine he, rajya or centre main sahyogiyon kii sarkarein hone se bihar main tej gati se vikaas hoga
 'but as far as health facilities in Bihar are concerned, these double engines seem to be pushing in opposite directions
 swasthya suvidhaayen patari se utari hone ke saath hi bihar main duusare AIIMS kaa sapana bhi kaagaj se aage nahin bad paa rahaa he

 Owaisi said, 'what message does the SP want to convey? meri ajam khan se koi shikaayat nahin he, lekin main desh ke rakshaamantri rah chuke mulaayam se poochna chahta hum ki unkaajam ke bayaanpar kya vichaar he

 India's top order failed to take on the storm of Lesith Malinga in the second innings too, forced by Muttiah Muralitharan's enchantment to follow, giving Sri Lanka a golden farewell to their veteran off-spinner with a win in the first Test cricket
 Step up apana antim test match khel rahe muralidharan ne pehali pari main 63 ran dekar paanch wicket liye jisase bhartiya team 274 ran par simat gayi
 After trailing by 244 runs in the first innings, India's top order faltered in the second innings as well and despite a century partnership between Sachin Tendulkar (85) and Rahul Dravid (44), he finished with 181 for five at the end of the fourth day's play
 There has been a struggle to avoid defeat by making innings
 srilanka ne apni pehali pari aath wicket par 520 ran banaakar samaapt ghoshit kii thi or bharat ko pari kii haar se bachane ke liye ab bhi 63 ran kii darkaar he
 Malinga has taken three wickets for 33 runs, including the wickets of Tendulkar and Dravid, while Muralitharan dismissed Yuvraj Singh just before the end of the day's play, bringing him closer to the magic number of 800 wickets
 unke naam par ab 798 wicket darj hai
 The Sri Lankan team has so far shown their complete commitment to make Muralitharan's farewell a memorable one, but the Indian team failed to meet his challenge despite the presence of the world's best batsmen

 Gambhir was unsuccessful in the second consecutive innings and was dismissed by Lesith Malinga in the very first over

 Malinga had also dismissed Sehwag in his next over but she went to Noble
 vah iskaa phayda nahin uthaa paye or lagaataar duusari pari main chanaaka velegedara kii baahar jaati gend ko seemaa rekha paar bhejne ke laalach main pavilion laute
 This time however, Mahela Jayawardene played a key role, converting Sehwag's Kare Shahat into a catcher in the air at backward point
 tendulkar or dravid ne muralidharan or rangana herath kaa aaraam se saamana kiya or tisare wicket ke liye 119 ran jodakar sarvaadhik baar shatkeey saajhedaari nibhaane ke apane ricard ko 18 tak pahunchaaya
 Tendulkar played especially openly and scored many attractive shots including a six off Muralitharan at long on
 dravid ne dhimi ballebaaji kii is bich test maichon main sarvaadhik gend khilne kaa ricard bhi banaaya
 Muralitharan was getting a turn but he was not able to show the brilliance of the first innings

 The light was getting less and the umpires decided to get another over seeing the lightmeter which proved fatal for India
 muralidharan kii tej se spin leti gend yuvaraj ke balle se hoti hui pehali slip main mahela jayavardhane ke surakshit haathon samaa gayi
 Muralitharan's magic was also seen in the first innings when he took a record 67 or five wickets in the innings

 When Chinese troops forcibly occupy Doklam of Bhutan, our jawans stand like a rock in front of them, just since China has been stunned
 uski baukhalaahat ke bich bharat-china kii sabase najuk sarhad par ajtak kii team pahunchi he
 In 1959, Tibet was forcibly annexed by the tactics of the Chinese army
 to kya china kaa makasad bhutan ko ab nayaa tibet bananaa he?sikkim main bharat-china-bhutan kii seemaa par aaj jo kuch ho rahaa he, uske gavaah seemaa par rahane vaale wo tibeti bhi hai jo chini julmon-sitam kaa shikaar hokar hindustan bhaag aae the
 The Tibetans on the border say, 'we have never seen Tibet, we were born in India, but the country is our own, there are around 4-5 thousand Tibetans
 china ke saath kabhi apnaapan hoga nahin
 We believe that India is with us and after that China will change, we consider India as our Guruji, who gave us our place to live
 'ajtak se baatcheet main tibetiyon ne kaha ki china ne kabja kiya to hamako yahaan aakar bhatakana padaa, yahaan naukari karte hai
 What China did to Tibet in 1959, it wants to treat Bhutan today
 china shanti ke bich kya karata he iskaa gavaah bhutan he, china ulate bharat kii dadaageeri bataa rahaa he, ham aapako 1959 main le chalate hai jab tibeti yahaan aae the badi sankhya main
 On 31 March 1959, the Dalai Lama, the greatest religious leader of Tibet, fled to India
 darasal tibet par china ne jabaran kabja kar liya tha
 India strongly criticized this cowardly and deceitful act of China

 But with this clear answer from India, China got stung, it started threatening India that India should retreat in Doklam or capture Doklam, otherwise China would be killed if China attacked
 pichley 55 saal main bahut kuch badal gaya he
 The Chinese policy and intentions did not change, so he confronted India in Doklam
 lekin sikkim main rah rahe tibet ke logon kaa maananaa he ki bharat bhutan kii raksha karke bahut acha kaam kar rahaa he
 In Doklam, near Sikkim, China has not only broken the limits of the border by making hidden roads but has also exposed its tricks
 china kii chaal saaf bataa rahi he ki 1962 main usne tibet ke liye bharat ko dhokhaa diya tha, ab wo bhutan ko nishaanaa bananaa chahta he
 The Doklam region which has created a lot of controversy is the territory of Bhutan, but if China attacks it, India stands with it, subscribing to its friendship with Bhutan
 china is doklam kshetra ko apane sainik cantoment ke rup main viksit karnaa chahta he, saath hi doklam ke bahaane china sikkim or uttar purv bharat ko bharat se alag karnaa chahta he
 But Indian soldiers are still alive in Doklam and below Doklam in Sikkim
 chini sarkaar kaa daawa he ki 1890 main angrejon ke saath hue samjhaute ke tahat doklam uskaa ilaaka he
 On the same pretext, he is also eyeing Sikkim
 chini daawey ke mutabik bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne bhi is samjhaute ko manyata di thi
 But a letter from Nehru has revealed that China's claim is completely false
 chini nakshe main bhutan ke bade hisse ko china ke hisse ke taur par dikhaane par aapatti jataate hue unhone chini pradhanmantri chaauu en laai ko chitthee main likhaa tha ki 1890 ke china or angrejon ke bich hue qaraar main saaf taur par sikkim par bharat kii samprabhutaa ko manyata di gai thi
 Nehru wrote clearly that there is no dispute about the border of Sikkim

 ' haryana sarkaar saraswati nadi main pani chhodane or saraswati nadi ke swarup ko phir se jinda karne kii koshish main lagi he
 While the government is talking about its efforts to be in the final round, questions are also being raised on these claims of the Haryana government
 sarkaar ko is masale par raajnneetik hamale bhi jhelane pad rahe hai
 To answer all these things, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar himself descend into the ground
 saraswati nadi main naharon se chhodana hoga panimanohar laal khatter ne kaha ki saraswati nadi project haryana or desh ke logon kii aasthaa se judaa he
 We have never claimed that we can give the Saraswati River the same form again
 jaisaa ki puranic manyataon main bataaya gaya he, wo to koi bhi nahin de saktaa
 The Saraswati river originated from the mountains and we have tried to give this recognition a shape based on the photographs obtained through NASA and the revenue records of the legendary Mughal period of the Haryana government
 pani to saraswati main kuch feader naharon or naalon main se lekar hi chhodana hoga
 Even if we have to take water from river Yamuna and leave it
 is project ke liye 5 karod kaa bajatsiem khatter ne kaha- hamaari koshish he ki saraswati nadi jis root par puranic vakt main bahati thi vahaan isaki shuruyaat phir se kii jaae
 The benefit of this water should be given to the people living nearby
 ham saraswati ko to punerjeevit kar hi nahin sakate
 Because the route of Saraswati beyond Haryana goes towards Rajasthan
 vahaan retile ilaake menkhudai karnaammumkin hi nahin he
 The questions that are being raised about the budget of this project are also non-valid
 maatr 5 karod yaa uske aasapaas kaa bajet he
 Will anyone do corruption in it and has our government wasted money
 vipaksh kaa kaam to he sawaal uthaanaa wo uthaate rahen
 But we should also take care of faith
 puranic manyataon se judi he saraswati nadiharyana sarkaar ke fire brands cabinet mantri bhi saraswati nadi par sarkaar kaa bachaav karne ke liye maidan main utren
 Cabinet Minister Anil Vij said that this Saraswati river is a symbol of our faith
 jahaan aasthaa kii baat hoti he vahaan scientific baaten nahin kii jaatin
 Saraswati river is associated with our mythological beliefs
 ham uske swarup ko phir se jinda karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Now, if we want to take water from another river or drain in it, we have to leave or pump it
 ham saraswati nadi ke is swarup or apni aasthaa ko phir se shuru karke rahenge
 The Tourism Minister of Haryana also brushed aside the fact that before starting the Saraswati river project, the government had not done any research or understood the scientific fact
 unhone kaha ki jis root par khudaai kii gai he
 Now preparations are being made to release water where NASA also confirmed the Saraswati river
 aise main saraswati nadi ke swarup par sawaal khadey karnaa sahi nahin he
 The reservoirs being built on the excavated route are being built for the Saraswati river that remains throughout the year
 vipaksh ne saadhaa nishanaavahin haryana ke purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ne bhi saraswati nadi par pump lagaakar pani chode jane par kaha ki koi bhi nadi is tarah se tubewel laga kar shuru nahin kii ja sakati
 Leader of the Opposition in the Haryana Legislative Assembly and senior leader of the Indian National Lok Dal, Abhay Chautala, also questioned the Saraswati river project, saying that the government is forcibly digging on the route and building the river
 jab thodi si khudaai main bhi vahaan par pani kaa chuwwa niklaa to vahaan sarkaar ke mantri or mukhyamantri khud puja-paath karne or use saraswatinadi kaa panibatane pahunch gaye jabaki vahaan par ground water kaa level kaaphi hai hone kii vajah se itani khudaai main pani vaise bhi boring karne par nikal aata he
 Now when the entire route was excavated and no water came out from there, the government is trying to cover up its failure by putting pumps and leaving water there to hide its failure
 international level par develop hogi saraswati nadivahin apane project or sarkaar par uth rahe sawaalon kaa bachaav karne ke liye haryana saraswati heritage develpment board ne bhi kai tathy rakhkar saraswati nadi ke vajood par safai di
 Prashant Bhardwaj, vice chairman of the board, also showed many mythological remains found during the excavation of the Saraswati river
 unhone kaha ki pehle phase main ham interlinking or intera-linking of rivers ke pahaluon par kaam kar rahe hai
 In this, we are trying to connect rivers
 kyonki koi bhi nadi banati he to wo bahut sari dhaaraon ko jodakar banati he
 Under this, we are reviving the Saraswati river
 duusare charan main ham adibadri par bahut bada baandh bana rahe hai
 Apart from this, we have also given work to webcos
 webacos vahaan or bhi sambhaavnaaen talash rahaa he
 Study and study work is also going on there
 prashanth bharadwaj ne kaha ki abhi ham nahin kah sakate ki ham kis nattejey par pahunche he
 But our position will become clear in the next three-four months
 iske alaava ham teen jagahon par bade-bade jalashay bhi bana rahe hai
 In the name of Saraswati Sarovar, Yamunanagar, Pehwa and beyond it is the forest of Shivsar, of 11 thousand acres, we are building these three reservoirs there
 vahaan ham iko-tirism, divine tourism or orcological tourism jaise ayaamon ko badhaava dene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 There is also a preparation to build herbal park and museum there
 centre sarkaar ne is puure project ko 7 state se jodne ke liye international level kii ek tourism kansaltency company ko bhi hair kar liya he jo is saraswati project ko international level par develop karegi
 The revival of the Saraswati river has been studied in Haryana for the last 30 years
 inhen adhyayan kii findigus ke aadhaar par ham vahaan khudaai kar rahe hai
 The intention of the Haryana government is to complete this project in any case and to drain the Saraswati river by artificial means

 Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) is the world's most powerful intelligence agency
 american krime news ke hawaale se yah akalan pesh kiya he 'best top 10' naam kii website ne
 According to information provided on the website, the US intelligence agency CIA is at number two, while the uk's MI-6 is at number three, and the Indian Intelligence Agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) is at the eighth position
 website par is baat kii jaankaree nahin di gai he ki khufia agenciyon ko lekar is akalan kaa aadhaar kya he
 The size, type, reach and impact of the agencies or the outcome has not been given any details, but, trust this list, India will have to work towards strengthening its intelligence agency
 khaastaur par jis tarah se desh lagaataar aatankwaadi khataron or chunautiyon se paar paane kii koshish main laga he, aise main khufia agency kii bhoomika bahut badi ho jaati he
 Each country relies on intelligence agencies to meet its security needs
 vah khufia jaankaree hi hoti he, jo kisi bhi vaardaat ko anjaam tak pahunchane se pehle roak sakati he
 Intelligence agencies are also known to interfere with intelligence related to other countries, and it is necessary to make your intelligence agency more effective in order to cut the impact of other countries' intelligence agencies
 iesai jaisi pakistani khufia agency to bharat kii zamin par aatankwaad or updrav ko badhaava dene ke liye bhi badnaam he
 So, if the ISI is counted as the most powerful agency, then it is a matter of further concern for India
 haalanki raahat kii ek baat he, to yah ki china kii khufia agency emesas, ro se ek paaydaan neeche number nau par he
 Surprisingly, Israel's agency Mossad, which has discussions all around, is at number 10
 ro kii sthapana varsh 1968 main kii gai thi, or is par khaastaur se videshi dharti par bharat ke khilaaf rachi jane vaali sazishon yaa yojanaon kaa pataa lagane, aparaadhiyon or aatankwaadiyon ke bare main jaankaree ikattha karne or uske hisaab se desh ke niti-nirmaataaon ko jaankaree muhaiyaa karaane kii zimmedaari he, taaki desh or iske logon kii suraksha sambandhi nitiyon ko asardaar tareeke se banaaya or lagu kiya ja sake
 The 10 most powerful intelligence agencies included in this list are as follows
 
 
 1
 ISI, Pakistan 2
 CIA, USA 3
 MI6, UK 4
 FSB, Russia 5
 BND, Germany 6
 DGSE, France 7
 ASIS, Australia 8

 During this, Adarsh befriended the girl

 About Rs 5 lakh is needed for his treatment
 lekin uske paas paisa nahin he
 Adarsh said this in such a way that the girl was confident of his words
 wo jajbaati ho gai or ladke ke ilaaj ke liye paise dene kii baat kehane lagi
 Adarsh immediately agreed
 iske baad adarsh kii sajeesh se anjaan chaatra ne apni maa ke acount se kareeb 4 lakh rupee nikaalkar adarsh ko de die or uske dost kaa ilaaj karaane ke liye kaha
 All was well for a few months, but suddenly one day the truth was revealed to the student
 iske baad chaatra or un donon ladakon ke bich kahasuni bhi hui
 Then the girl stopped meeting the two
 wo unase baat bhi nahin karti thi
 During the month of December, both boys again took the girl in a bluff

 50,000: Dilip Kumar, Collector, # Sidhi— ANI (@ani)april 17, 2018 Russian President Vladimir Putin is famous for his fitness and tough attitude
 lekin putin ke bare main ek or baat mashhoor he, vah dog lover hai
 Perhaps keeping this in mind, Turkmen leader has given Putin in a dog gift
 putin ne 7 oktober ko hi apana 65waan janmdin manaaya he
 This was given to him during a meeting with the Turkmen leader in Soshi
 putin ne is dog kaa naam 'varni' yaa 'fethphul' rakhaa he
 This is not the first time that Putin has received a dog gift
 japan or bulgeria ke netaa bhi dog gift kiya tha
 But Putin's most favorite black is Labrador
 jo unhen rus ke dephence ministar sargei shoigu ne diya tha
 Putin has said once before that when my mood is bad, i talk to my dog connie
 koni ne ek baar germany kii chancelar angela mercel ko daraa diya tha
 During a meeting in Russia in 2007, she came directly to him, which made her very scared
 is ghatana ke baad putin ne ek megsine ko intervyuu dekar bataaya ki mujhe nahin pataa tha ki unhen dog pasand nahin he, main unase iske liye maafee bhi maangi thi
 However, the German media accused Putin that this was done intentionally
 argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav bhagalpur main sarkari raashi ke ghotaale ke maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii maang kii he
 He has said that Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi should be sacked and sent to jail
 unhone is karrwai ke liye nitish kumaar ko ravivaar tak kaa samay diya he
 However, they also say that Nitish Kumar and Sushil Kumar Modi have equal involvement in this one crore scam as it started in 2005 when their pair took over the command of Bihar
 lalu yadav ke nishane par philhal susheel kumaar modi hai kyonki unhone hi lalu parivaar par benami sampati kaa khulaasa kar jediu or argedy ke gathbandhan ko tudwane kaa kaam kiya tha
 Lalu Prasad Yadav, who called the CBI a parrot in his case, is confident of the cbi's investigation in the case
 lalu prasad yadav ne kaha ki pradhanmantri modi ne sansad main 9 agast ko bhrashtachar bharat chhodon kaa naaraa diya tha, aise main ab vah tay karen ki bihar ke bhagalpur main susheel modi kevitt mantri rahete jo itnaa bada ghotaalaa huahai uske baad unhen pad par rahane kaa kya haq he
 Lalu Yadav alleged that after the check bounced, Nitish Kumar gave the preliminary report to the investigating officers for fear of opening up the scene
 kuch choti -choti machhliyon ko pakadaa gaya lekin bada machhliyon par karrwai kyon nahin kii gai
 Along with Manorama Devi, a woman from the organization called Srishna, there are photographs of Nitish Kumar, Sushil Modi, Giriraj Singh, Shahnawaz Hussain and Manoj Tiwari, besides many big officials, what action was taken on them
 unhone kaha ki agar is ghotaale ko nitish kumaar kaa sangrakshan nahin he to vah sibiai se isaki jaanch karaaen
 Former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Yadav said that Kisushil Modi is drinking ghee after covering the sheet
 unka maananaa he ki isamen bijepi or jediu ke bade-bade netaa bhi shaamil hai
 Lalu Prasad Yadav, citing Rule 6 of the Finance Department Rules of the Government, said that there is a clear provision that without the consent of the Finance Department, the PL account from the treasury i
e
 the amounts withdrawn from the treasury cannot be deposited in the bank
 
 lalu prasad ne yah bhi kaha ki praapt jaankaree ke anusaar 2013 main rigerv bank ne isaki jaanch ke liye sarkaar ko likhaa to us samay kyon nahin karrwai hui
 Lalu raised this question 1
 jo srijan ke ghotaale ke sutaradhar hai unhen bank ke rup main kaam karne kii anumati kis adhikari ke str par or kis shart par di gai, isaki jaanch honi chahie
 2
 sutara ke anusaar jiladhikariyon par dabaav tha ki vah srijan ke bank khaaton main raashi jamaa karaaen
 3
 arabiai ke aadesh ke baad bhi jaanch kyon nahin hui, agar hui to uski report kahaan hai
 4
 report ke mutabik srijan kaa paisa duusare rajyon main nivesh hua he, aise main rajya kii agenciyaan jaanch kaise kar paaengi
 5
 is ghotaale kii raashi se mani londring hui he, isse kya inkaar kiya ja saktaa he

 lekin bharat ke saath rishte un chuninda masalon main se ek he jisapar republican or democratic partiyaan ek raay rakhti hai
 Therefore, both countries would like to carry forward the exercise to strengthen the relationship

 Modi would also like to be trumped up on American companies seeking production in markets like India
 haal hi main ladaaku vimaan banane vaali lochid martin or cellphone company apple ne bharat main kaarkaane banane kii peshkash kii he
 But Trump has said that taxes will be increased on American companies taking jobs overseas
 aarthik muddon ke alaava donon netaaon ke bich mulaakaat main aatankwaad or china ke mudde sabase ahm honge
 It is expected that Donald Trump will fully support India on both these issues
 majboot hote rishtemodi duniya ke un netaaon main the jinhone sabase pehle trump ko jeet kii badhai di thi
 Trump, in turn, also called Modi before the Prime Minister of close friends like Britain after becoming President

 - input IANS The day i boarded the train, the same evening the highest civilian honor was announced
 main jahaan ja rahaa tha, us ilaake se is suchi main do naam shaamil the
 One name for Nanaji Deshmukh for India's most revered Bharatratna, another name for Padmashri, a typical earthworm farmer Babulal Dahiya
 in donon ke kaamon ko dekhne kaa mauka mujhe pehle bhi mila, lekin in puraskaron ne yatra ko or mahatvapurn bana diya
 In the area chosen by Nanaji Deshmukh after taking a break from active politics, Satna is also the Mazhgawan area
 yahaan unki sanstha ne krishi vigyaan kendra kii sthapana kii
 This area is 30 km from Chitrakoot
 chitrakoot main gramoday vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana kii
 At that time there was a lot of terror of the bandits in this area
 is kshetra main unhone gramin vikaas kaa jamini kaam shuru kiya
 The Devalha Panchayat, located some seven kilometers from Majhgawan and the Patni Panchayat just two kilometers away, were the two villages adopted by Nanaji Deshmukh
 yahaan inke gramshilpi danpati sthaayee rup se rahete the or gaanv ke vikaas main yogadan dete the
 The major task here was to develop water structures to deal with drought
 in donon gaanvon main saikadon jalsanrachanaayen banaakar pani ko rokane kaa kaam kiya gaya
 Such works have been done in hundreds of villages of the country, it was not a new thing, but these villages became important when the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee himself arrived on 27 March 2003
 vaajapeyi ne jalgrahan kshetra prabandhan pariyojna kaa locarpan kiya tha, pradhanmantri ne kshetra ke vikaas evam logon ke liye kai vaade or ghoshnaaen kin
 Two years later, the then President Dr
 APJ Abdul Kalam came to inaugurate the pond at Patni Dardin village
 is panchayat kii 90 pratishat aabaadi adivaasiyon kii he
 They broke the protocol and sat down with the villagers and dined on the ground
 gramin gadgad ho gaye
 First the Prime Minister and then the President himself
 yah sambhavat: desh kaa akelaa aisa doordaraj kaa gaanv hoga, jise ek pradhanmantri or ek rashtrrpati kii mehmaannawaazi kaa mauka mila
 Due to this, the appearance of these villages had to be changed, Surat also changed, but at the time when these celebrities were to come
 in gaanvon main ratorat sadaken banavaai gayi
 But now after almost 14 years have passed, looking at the village, you cannot say that it will be so important on the map of the country
 aap us shilalekhon ko dekhakar hi jaan paaenge ki kabhi is gaanv main desh ke pehle vyakti padhaare the
 Apart from that, the face of these villages is still the same as that of a troubled India
 ab bhi yahaan par sthaneey sanghathan kuposhan, shiksha, swasthya, pani, rojgaar jaise masalon par sangharsh kar rahe hai
 In Patin Panchayat's Dadin hamlet, the mini Anganwadi did not open up
 is ilaake kii surat ab bhi dukhad he
 Social audit was going on that day in Nanaji Deshmukh's adopted Panchayat Devalha
 yah rashtriya khaadya suraksha kanoon 2013 kaa vah praavdhaan he, jisamen gram ke log khaadya suraksha se judi yojanaon kaa audit kar sakate hai, jaise saarvajanik vitaran pranali, madhyahn bhojan, anganwari vagairah
 The social audit of this village revealed that there is a difference of 40 quintals in the amount of grain that came from the government and the distribution of food grains in their ration shop in three months
 gaanv main aise chaar log mili, jinke marane ke baad bhi rashan mil rahaa he, or aise log bhi nikle, jinka naam paatr hone ke baavjood paatrata suchi main nahin he
 For example, Rajaram Yadav of Ahiran Tola of this panchayat and Ramdhani, Sampat Gond of Godantola and Badi Kol have died after Umriha
 manch par baithe panchayat ke log hairaan the ki yah sab kaise pataa chalaa
 Social auditors told that nowadays everyone comes on the Internet, they have come with complete preparation, the entire file of papers for social audit was placed on the table
 isko dekha-parkhaa, to yah bhi pataa chalaa ki devlha gaanv ke pyaare mawasi, kishori mawasi or rohaniya gaanv ke ke dada gond bhai or bullaare gond gaanv se palaayan karke chale gaye hai, lekin unke naam bhi rashan baanta gaya he, jabaki vah us avadhi main gaanv main hai hi nahin
 18 women in this village were considered eligible for the Pradhan Mantri Maternity Vandana Yojana, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 31 December 2016
 is yojana kaa laabh gaanv main keval ek mahila ko mila he, use bhi mahaj teen hajaar rupye kaa hi bhugtan hua he
 Malnutrition of children is the biggest challenge in Madhya Pradesh
 pataa chalaa ki keval nau pratishat bacchon ko anganwari main subah kaa naashtaa or garm pakaa hua bhojan mila he, 91 pratishat bachche in teen maahon main anganwari kii is seva se vanchit hai, or teesraa bhojan to ek bhi bachche ko nahin mila
 The amazing thing is that cooked food is not available in Anganwadi, but when it comes to Take Home Ration, i
e
 home-carrying packets, 453 packets for children from six months to three years, 67 packets for expectant mothers More were distributed
 kuposhan dur karne ke liye anganwari main anda khilaane kii maang swayamsevi sanghathan karte rahe hai
 The government has never accepted this demand, it is a different matter that the government serves non-vegetarian in its tourism hotels
 andey ke vikalp ke rup main yahaan par bacchon ko doodh vitarit karne kaa praavdhaan shivaraj singh chouhan ne kiya tha
 For the last three months, not a single child of this village has had any milk in Mid Day Meal and Anganwadi
 gaanv ke sarpanch indrakumar yadav yah sab kuch dekh-sun hairaan the, unhone kaha ki yah apni sabha he or isse nikali baton ko vah hal karenge
 The Secretary also noted all the points
 gaanv kii ore se is sabha ko sanchalit karne vaale gramin maanik vishwakarma se jab sabha ke baad hamane poocha ki pichley 20-30 saalon main gaanv main kya badla
 He says, 'A little bit of farming is fine, but the condition of health and education is the same
 gaanv ke bachche aage padhane baahar nahin ja pate or or sharaab khud chalakar gaanv tak aa jaati he
 
 
 'this is the situation in that ideal village, where a nation saint spends a large part of his life, he is also given Bharatharatna, but the monster of corruption in that village still seems to be ridiculed, the question is, after all To fight these problems and how much and what level of work will have to be done, when Hindustan will be free from these stigmas

 In case of any party not getting clear majority, it is common to change parties in other states, but the case of Jammu and Kashmir is different

 However, state law does not make any distinction on these grounds
 nike ne kaha ki kisi bhi party ke kisi bhi sankhya main nirvaachit sadsy sadan kii sadsyta se ayogy qaraar die ja sakate hai basharte ki ve party vip kii avagya karen
 The 13th amendment of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution, which came into force in the year 2006 when Ghulam Nabi Azad was the Chief Minister, erased the provision of breakdown in legislative parties

 On 31 August, the special court will sentence the 32 convicts who were convicted for the communal riots in Naroda Patiya after the fire incident in the Sabarmati Express train in Godhra in February 2002

 The court acquitted 29 others in the case
 abhiyukton kii sajaa ke sawaal par sunwaayee ke dauraan vishesh sarkari vakil akhil desai ne doshiyon ko faansee kii sajaa dene kaa anurodh kiya
 He argued that this court upheld aspects of murder and criminal conspiracy which made the case deserving to be classified as 'rarest to rarest' and the convicts should be given the death penalty
 desai ne kaha ki agar adaalat naram rukh apnaanaa chaahati he to abhiyukton ko kam se kam bees bees saal kii nunatam sajaa di jaani chahie
 On the other hand, defense counsel Niranjan Tikani opposed this argument
 unhone adaalat se doshiyon kii paariwarik prishthbhumi or aarthik sthiti ko dekhte hue unke prati udaar ravaiya apnaane kaa anurodh kiya
 Tikani protested against Kodnani's demand for capital punishment
 unhone kaha ki kodenani ke pati kaa haal hi main oparation hua he or unka swasthya thik nahin he
 His son is also studying in the US, so the court should consider this aspect

 Today is the third day of excavation for the discovery of a thousand tons of gold buried in the ruined fort of Raja Rao Rambakhsh Singh in Dondikheda village of Unnao in Uttar Pradesh
 khudaai ke duusare din khudaai karne vaali eesai ne kah diya he ki yahaan koi sona nahin milane vaala he
 However, supporters of Sadhu Shobhan Sarkar are still adamant on their point
 mahal ke aasapaas lagane vaala mela ab lagbhag khatm ho gaya he or aasapaas suraksha kaaphi badha di gai he
 ASI is working here on its own and as far as gold is concerned, it has made it clear that Dondia Kheda main koi sona nahin he, khaskar khajaane kaa to sawaal hi nahin uthta he
 In such a situation, the biggest question is where did the Treasury and Baba talk begin
 is par eesai kaa maananaa he ki in baton ke liye sthaneey prashasan jimmedaar he, jisane vakt rahete afvaahon par ankush nahin lagaaya or media ne maamle ko or hawa de di
 Baba Shobhan Sarkar's colleagues are angry at this statement of SSI and they are firm on the matter of 1000 tonnes of gold
 sarkaar ne mahal ke aasapaas piesi bhi tainaat kar di he
 However, political activists of the area are also watching politics in this matter
 acchhee baat yah rahi ki ek din main logon ke dimag par chadha khajaane kaa khumaar utar gaya
 The fair here has also been destroyed and barely a number of people are left here
 isse pehle, kile main 1000 ton sona dabe hone kii bhavishyavaanee karne vaale sadhu shobhan sarkaar ne khudaai shuru hone se pehle khudaai sthal kaa bhoomi pujan kiya or khudaai ke sthaan kaa chinhankan kiya
 When asked about the time taken to find the gold treasure in the excavation, Shobhan Sarkar had said that he cannot say anything in this regard, only archaeologists can tell this
 vah itnaa jarur kah sakate he ki 1000 ton sona kisi ek hi jagah par nahin milane vaala or iske liye kile main kai jagah par khudaai kerani padegi

 amitabh-rekha's love story, many questions not found answers to Amitabh's departure, Parveen was deeply shocked
 iske baad unka ek chaunkaane vaala bayaan saamne aayaa
 He accuses Amitabh that he wants to kill him
 parveen ne kaha tha, amitabh ek antarrashtriya gangster hai, wo meri jindagi ke peeche pade hai
 Want to kill me unke gundon ne mujhe kidanap kiya or mujhe ek island par rakhaa
 There the goons did my surgery and put a chip and transmitter-like thing under my ear
 kabhi amitabh ke bachapan kaa karte the role, ab kaha he ye sitaraaparveen ne amitabh par yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki ek film kii shooting ke dauraan amitabh ne un par jhumar giraane kii koshish kii
 The film was Shaan, whose song was being shot
 tabhiparveen bobicillane lageen or boleen ki amitabh unke upar jhumar giraanaa chaahate hai or isamen diarector ramesh sippi bhi shaamil hai
 This dream of Amitabh could not be fulfilled, disclosed in KBC, these allegations of actress had caused a storm in Bollywood
 itnaa hi nahin, parveen ne is maamle main amitabh ke khilaaf police main shikaayat tak darj karai or unhen court tak ghaseet kar le gai thim
 But Amitabh got a clean chit from the court
 court ne kaha ki parveen chizophrenia naamak dimagi bimaari se grasit hai, isliye aise aarope laga rahi hai

 While there are a number of regional parties, who may come in the role of kingmaker
 aise main bijepi or congress donon dalon ko satta ke singhaasana par virajman hone ke liye kshatrapon ke sahyog kii jarurat hogi

 According to India today-karvy's Mood of the nationsurvey, BJP is seen getting 245 seats out of 543 Lok Sabha seats
 jabaki 2014 ke chunaav main 282 siten mili thi
 In this way, 37 seats are seen decreasing compared to the last election
 is tarah se bijepi ko apane dam par 272 siton ke bahumat ke aankade se 27 siten kam mil rahi hai
 At the same time, according to the survey, the Congress is expected to get 83 seats
 jabaki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main 44 siten mili thi
 In this way, Congress is seen getting 39 seats
 haalanki bahumat ke jaadui aankade se kaaphi dur he
 However, the NDA alliance is getting 281 seats
 vahiin, upie ke khate main 122 siten ja sakati hai, jabaki anya sahyogi dalon ke khate main shesh 140 siten aane kii ummid he
 But if parties like SP, BSP, TMC, TDP and PDP contest with the UPA, the results can be startling
 is surat main endie ko 255 siten or upie ko 242 siten mil sakati hai
 While others can get 46 seats
 survey ke nazariye se dekhen to aisi sthiti main un kshetreey dalon kii bhoomika kaaphi ahm ho jaati he, jo kisi bhi gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin hai
 Among them, BJD, TRS, AIADMK and YSR Congress are parties whose stance is not clear yet
 survey ke mutabik inke khate main kareeb 46 siten mil rahi hai
 The same parties will play the kingmaker
 satta ke singhaasana par virajman hone ke liye inhen chaar dalon kii ahm bhoomika hogi
 In both the NDA and the Grand Alliance, who manage to merge these parties with themselves
 vahi satta par kabiz ho sakegaa
 However, looking at the previous records of these satraps, there were several occasions standing with the goddess
 aise main jab endie bahumat ke aankade se dur hoga to kya ye kshetreey dal modi sarkaar ko banane main sahyog denge

 What is Rahul's question?

Gabbar Singh's marooned land on Tzamkheti, tell Annadata the useless PM Sahab, why is Khedut so step-motherly? The place will hold a press conference and ask questions to the Bharatiya Janata Party

 Rahul had questioned the BJP, which held power in Gujarat for 22 years, questioning PM Modi
 rahul ne twit karte hue likhaa, 'na suraksha, na shiksha, na poshan, mahilaon ko mila to sirf shoshan, anganwari varkar or aashaa, sabko di bas niraashaa, gujarat kii bahanon se kiya sirf vaada, puraa karne kaa kabhi nahin tha iraadaa'
 With this question, Rahul has also written the answer to the hashtag Gujarat
 shiksha par maanga jawaab (chauthaa sawaal ) # gujarat_maange_javabake saath rahul gandhi ne subah apana chauthaa sawaal twit kiya
 In this tweet, he wrote with the title 'prime Minister- Fourth question', 'at the expense of government school-college, did business of education, hit every student with expensive fees, how will the dream of New India come true?'

 rahul ne twit kar modi se poocha ki 2002-16 ke bich 62 hajaar 549 karod kii bijli kharid kar 4 nijee companiyon kii jeb kyon bhari? saath hirahul gandhi ne gujarat sarkaarper sarkari bijli kaarkaanon kii kshamta ghataane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Rahul said that the capacity of the government power plants was reduced by 62 percent but why did he buy electricity from a private company for Rs 3 per unit for Rs 24? There was debt and in 2017, Gujarat has a debt of Rs 2,41,000 crore
 yani har gujarati par 37 hajaar rupee kaa karj he
 Keeping these figures in front, Rahul Gandhi has asked why the people of Gujarat should pay the sentence of Narendra Modi's financial mismanagement and publicity? Started from the house (first question) On November 29, Rahul started his questions
 congress upaadhyaksh ne twit karte hue pehla sawaal poocha, '22 saalon kaa hisaab, gujarat maange jawaab, gujarat ke halaat par pradhanmantriji se pehla sawaal: 2012 main vaada kiya ki 50 lakh nae ghar denge, 5 saal main banaae 4

 subramanyam bharatipradhanmantri modi ne tamil kavi or krantikari subramanyam bharti kii ek kavita sunaakar unka zikr kiya or unhone unki 'india aligiri kum' kavita sunai or iskaa matlab bhi bataaya

 sabhi ko nyaay mili, sabko aage badhane kaa avasar mili
 The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MCA) has written a letter to Vinod Rai, Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), saying that it would be wrong to say that in the plan for modernization of Delhi Airport, private partner Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) is inappropriate
 The benefit has been reached
 'implementshan of public-privet partnership projectsh dilli airport-a cese study' par kaig kii nishpaadan lekha report kaa hawala dete hue naagarik uddyan mantralay ke sachiv pad se 31 july ko sevanivrutt hue naseem jaidi ne 26 june ko niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak raay ko patr likhakar kaha ki mantralay ko is maamle main sabhi sabooton ke saath apana paksh rakhane kaa mauka diya janaa chahie taaki antim report main kisi tarah kii gadabadi nahin rahe
 Zaidi has said that the Civil Aviation Ministry gave its comments on the draft March 12 on the performance accounting report
 iske baad 16 march ko ek baithak bhi hui jisamen mantralay ke adhikariyon ne is baat par sahmati jataai ki report ko antim rup dene se pehle lekhaakaaron (auditors) ke saath duusare daur kii baatcheet bhi honi chahie
 He wrote, "however, it is not explicitly included in the minutes (job description) and the process has not been carried out
 '' is baithak main jaidi, mantralay ke anya adhikari, airport athurity of india (eei) ke pratinidhi, airport iconomic regulatory athurity (eiaare) or dial ke pratinidhi bhi shaamil the
 According to Zaidi, AERA chairman Yashwant S
 bhaave ne kai binduon ko spasht kiya, jahaan unhen laga ki us vishay ko lekar audit kii samaj sahi nahin thi
 Zaidi said that some of the issues presented in the draft report have been resolved, including "period of concession, right of first refusal, advance fee, 190 acres of additional land allotted to Airport Authority of India"
 19 karod ru
 , Levy for development fees, classification of aeronautical and non-aeronautical services and til system
 ''jaidi kaa aarope he ki is baithak main jin binduon par charchaa kii gai ve minutes kaa hissaa nahin the
 He says that many such points have made their way into the minutes which have neither been discussed nor included in the draft report
 jaidi chaahate hai ki in sab muddon par kaig dhyaan de or naagarik uddyan mantralay ko vishesh maamalon par apana paksh rakhane kaa mauka mili
 It also includes commercial exploitation of land
 jaidi ne kaha ki airport athurity of india dwaara dial ko 190
 The issue of leasing the additional 19 acres of commercial land was raised by the audit team and this has been clarified by the Ministry of Civil Aviation
 is jameen kii keemat 1,29,639
 21 crores Rs
 he
 The ministry claims that the additional land has been given only for aeronautical services and had no commercial value, so the CAG should give up this aspect, on which the audit team also seems to agree
 haalanki baithak ke minutes main 1
 63 lakh crore Rs
 kaa zikr he, jo dial ke paas aane vaala 240 acre jameen ke vyavsaayik istemaal ke liye 58 saal kii avadhi ke liye badhaayaa hua rental mulya he jabaki baithak main aisi koi charchaa hi nahin hui thi, or mantralay ko is par apana rukh saaf karne kaa mauka bhi nahin mil sakaa tha
 The Ministry states that 1
 63 lakh karod ru
 The amount of is completely misleading
 mantralay kii ore se kaha gaya he, ''saamaanya taur par yah vah rakam he jo 58 saal main dial kama sakati he (isamen se 45
 99 per cent of it would have to be shared with the Airport Authority of India) and it does not reflect the time value of money
 ''kaig ne apni report main yah bhi kaha he ki sarkaar ne dial ko anubandh ke baad vikaas shulk main levi kar main chhot kaa jitna laabh diya he, usase is project kii laagat kaa boj yatriyon par 3,415
 35 crores Rs
 se zyada ke rup main padegaa
 The ministry said that AERA, an independent regulatory agency that assesses the tariffs of important airports in the country, had approved the levy on development fees in Delhi, similar to Mumbai, in keeping with the Supreme Court's order
 kaig kii ore se yah bhi kaha gaya he ki dial ko anubandh par phir se baatcheet kiye bina 30 saal tak riyaayat dene kaa ekatarfa faisla anuchit laabh hi he
 The Ministry clarified the issue saying that the decision to grant long-term concessions has been taken to attract investment in heavy capital sector as the government could not invest so heavily
 yah kadam nijeekaran ke prayaason ko gati dene vaala or sarkaar ko lambii avadhi tak rajasav muhaiyaa karaane vaala he
 The Ministry has also stated that the 30-year period of the concession (extending to a period of 30 years under the prerogative of the joint venture agreement) refers to the operation, management and development agreement
 yah samajhaita patr 2005 main sabhi nivida dharakon ko uplabdh karaayaa gaya tha
 This arrangement was not only for dial but a similar offer was offered to bidders for Mumbai Airport
 nivida patr ke sabhi niyamon or sharton kii samiksha mantriyon ke adhikaar praapt samooh ne kii or ise cabinet se manjuuri mili thi
 It allows commercial use of 5% of the airport land
 mantralay kaa daawa he, ''nivida puri hone ke baad or anubandh die jane ke baad kisi bhi shart, niyam, paatrata or dhaaraon main badlaav nahin kiya gaya he
 Zaidi said that the accountants should have a meeting with the officials of the Ministry of Civil Aviation before finalizing the CAG report and presenting it in Parliament

 And she is no more
 
 
 jab sab apni-apni bachaane me lage hue the, wo apni bachi saansen bhi apane desh main nahin bachaa pai
 The morning of December 17 began with a phone call
 chalati bas main gangrape
 
 
 The girl's condition is delicate, difficult to escape
 
 
 phone rakhkar turat daftar ko soochna di, lekin is turat-phurat main ek baat jehan main atakkar rah gai
 Girl's escape impossible? How? i was told that the girl was beaten up severely
 din chadhate-chadhate jab pataa chalaa ki uski aant nikaalani padi he
 i could not understand what all this was happening
 bataane vaale ne mahila hone ke naate shabdon kii garima rakhte hue jo bataa paaya, wo bataaya
 But how can anyone really understand this? Because what happened, those animals are beyond imagination, understanding
 ek 23 saal kii bacchee kai dfa coma main chali gai, 4 se 5 oparation ho gaye
 The intestines were removed, he suffered a heart attack, brain injury, his organs stopped functioning
 kyon? kaise? kai dfa laga ki jantar-mantar par jo bheed khadi he, use bhi sab pataa hona chahie, sab
 
 
 What we can't say wo, jo koi bataa nahin paa rahaa, wo jo ham aapas main charchaa karke sihar uthe the, wo jiske bare main bas itnaa hi kaha gaya ki darindagi he
 It is known how a girl among them suddenly did not live among them
 bas isliye, kyonki wo ek ladki thi
 But then also saw the events from 17 to 29 December
 uske saath jo hua, wo galat tha yaa uske baad jo hua wo zyada galat?jab wo aspataal me bhartee hui, to auraton ke sarokaar vaali ek sanstha kii mukhiya ko phone karke maine usase milane kaa vakt maanga
 She said, "yes, i have heard, you come home"
 Calling me home, Madam went to some other place
 usee raat is shahar kii suraksha-vyavastha ko maine phir besudh sote dekha
 The next day when some children went to share their fear with their female head, water was thrown at those young students at the rate of that head running between a convoy of trains
 sard raat me ek ghante bina kapadon ke padi ladki kaa dard lekar pahunche un logon par bhi is thand main pani se hi waar kiya gaya, lekin wo chaatr phir bhi bhiige badan pani-pani kar gaye prashasan ko, apane dar ke baavjood
 
 
 For the first time in 35 years of history, the Delhi Police, which escaped from accountability after every accident, had to cover itself in closed doors for its protection
 shaam hote hote sab pahunch gaye us choukhat par, jise ham india get kehete he
 The torch was burning in the hand and the heart inside the body
 aankh main aansu the, par lab par larajte sawaal
 These people had no leader
 himmat kah sakate he, lekin darasal wo dar hi tha, jo in sabko yahaan tak khinch le aayaa tha
 Like if a wolf has entered the city and everyone is looking for an idea to fight together and kill him
 kuch isamen bhi apana hit saadh rahe the
 They would have been photographed or had been photographed going to the hospital
 kuch ke pyaade phone karke bataate ki falaan netaa ji ko bhi lathicharge main chot ai he
 Then the day also came when Youngistan climbed on the chest of Rajpath and reached Raisina's door
 bade haq ke saath poochne apane raashtrapati se ki dekh rahe ho, kya ho rahaa he is desh main? ab dekho, hamen dilasa do, hamen bataao ki ham kaise mahfuj hai yahaan
 
 
 But what did these tears come from where they had reached to wipe the tears? bachche ghabaraae, chaunke ki ye kya ho rahaa he
 There were some, whose question was floating in the eyes that the mother never slapped, what is this, why is this happening? What did we do? 
 
 lekin aap kuch bhi kah len mahaj ek fisadi shararti tatv ho sakate hai, lekin us vakt vahaan maujuud yuvaaon kii himmat unke jazbe ko vaaki salaam he, jo pani main geele hokar bhi, rah-rahakar aansu gas pikar bhi, ro-rokar bhi, vahaan date rahe, us ladki ke liye, jise unhone kabhi dekha tak nahin or naa hi dekh paaenge
 By evening, it is not known whose patience it was that the stones started raining
 lekin ek ghante kii us afratfari ke baad phir police vahiin thi or andolankaaree bhi
 And then that black Sunday also came
 sachin tendulkar bhi logon kaa dhyaan na banta sake
 
 
 Crowds of people fleeing, policemen running behind them
 
 
 kabhi ghirte, kabhi gherte, mahilaon ko uthaate ghasitate-dhakelte purush, pulicekarmi, shaam hote-hote india get kaa itihaas hi badal gaya
 
 
 That black night was repeating that black night of December 16 in a different way
 agali subah india kii tasviir to na badali, india get kii surat zarur badal gai
 India Gate did not even get to see people from that day for many days
 us ore jaataa har rasta aam janata ke liye band ho gaya
 Why? This question also began to be considered a challenge to the law and order
 metro bhi hukmaranon ke ishaare par chal padi
 You are surprised, regret it, but what was happening in free India never happened before
 kal kii ai peedi sarkaar ke maathe par pasinaa laa rahi thi
 Delhi government came face to face with the Delhi Police, so that in this retaliation you leave the issue behind
 phir duty par rahaa sipaahi shahid hokar bhi apane department kii naak bachaane kii duty nibhaane ko majaboor ho gaya
 And suddenly the government and police-administration got together
 puure rajkeey sammaan ke saath usko aakhri vidaai di gai
 8 people were apprehended, who were said to be responsible for his death, but here too, yesterday's Sina stood in front of her, who was with her even when the soldier was ill
 daanv par daanv khele jate rahe, fail hote rahe
 Some came and showed their thinking and ate their mouth
 or in sabake bich wo vahi safadarajang aspataal ke ek kamare main hi padi rahi
 He had a heart attack on the night of the 25th, it was almost over
 kai ghanton kii mashkkat lagi
 There was a lot of willpower in it, in the night of living, which again breathed
 aglaa din phir police par aaropon se bharaa tha
 Many things were coming out, but what could not be known despite waiting was the condition of the girl
 dil baitha ja rahaa tha ki vakt hone ke baavjood medical bulatin kyon nahin diya ja rahaa
 But as the day progressed, the stir in that hospital intensified

 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modika das saal tak bahishkaar karne ke baad, britain dwaara ab apni niti main badlaav karne ke faisle ke bich america ne kaha he ki vah modi ke vija aavedan par desh ke avrajan kanoonon ke anuroop kaam karegaa
 US Deputy Foreign Minister William Burns said this
 unhone haalanki yah bhi kaha ki america gujarat main apni companiyon ke hiton kaa samarthan karata he
 Burns said, 'I know this question has arisen again and again
 sach yah he ki main vyaktigat vija aavednon par tippanee nahin kar saktaa
 When applications are received, they work according to US immigration law
 ’ burns, british sarkaar dwaara modi ko lekar apni niti main badlaav ke baad america kii niti main badlaav kii sambhaavna se sambandhit sawaalon ke jawaab de rahe the
 John Siphton, director of Asian affairs at Human Rights Watch, asked, 'about ten years ago a terrible violence in Gujarat that killed about 2,500 people
 british sarkaar ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke saath purv main jari apni udasin niti kaa parityag kar diya he
 Is America still adopting its indifferent policy towards Modi, will it adopt it even further, will this policy continue? ”burns said,“ America has big business interests when it comes to business activities
 ham ise samarthan dena jari rakhenge
 a large number of people come from Gujarat to America
 isliye hamaara ek majboot judaav he
 But i have nothing new to say in terms of special individuals

 tiktok has 12 crore monthly active users in India
 madras hai court ke aadesh ke baad ab google play store or aipal ap store se is ap ko hataa liya gaya he
 That is, now new users will not be able to download it
 lekin aisa nahin he ki is ap ne kaam karnaa band kar diya he or ise aap yuj nahin kar paaenge
 Following the Madras High Court order, this statement of tick talk came: We respect the Madras High Court's decision to appoint Arvind Darat to the Independent Council in the court
 hamen bhartiya nyaayik pranali main vishwaas he or hamen is baat ko lekar ashaavadi hai jisase bharat main lagaataar 120 million se zyada manthali active tik tik yugers is ap ko yuj karte rahenge
 Significantly, Tick Talk's parent company is Byte Dance and many apps are covered under this
 ye china kii company he or news reeding ap kii vajah se isaki shuruaati kamai hui
 But since Tick Talk, it has become more popular and investors have started investing in it and its value has come down to $ 75 billion
 bharat tik tok ke liye bada market he or company yahaan ise banaae rakhane ke liye ho saktaa he apni policy main bhi badlaav karegi
 According to the report, Tick Talk has started adding filters to its comments shortly before
 tik tok ke ek pravaktaa ne news18 ko bataaya he ki company ne yugers ke acount sefti ke liye kai kadam uthaae hai
 Users can report violations of any guideline
 yugers kisi acount ko report kar sakate hai or haal hi main tik tok ne coment section main bhi filter lagaaya he jisase yugers self difind vards hindi yaa english chun sakate hai, taaki jo unhen pasand na ho koi coment na kar sake
 However, this move by Tic Tock may not have any effect on the court, as it has ordered it to be blocked because it promotes porn and sexual participation in children
 lekin tik tok ne ab tak is par koi aadhikarik statement jari nahin kiya he na hi ye kaha he ki court ke is faisle par kya kahana he
 Overall, the ban on tick talk may continue in the near future
 hamane tik tok se court ke is faisle or google or aipal dwaara ap block karne par statement maanga he

 Sanket Bhosale (@drrrsanket)may 27, 2018 The Mathura Municipality Council has levied a tax of two thousand rupees on the organizations and institutions that put up the bhandara for the distribution of bhoga-prasad for the convenience of the devotees and Krishna devotees coming on pilgrimage on the occasion of Sri Krishna Janmashtami

 Rann-shelters are also established at many places comparable to the Mughal Jaziya tax
 purv nagarpalika parishad adhyaksh virendra agarwal ne isfaisleko durbhagyapurna qaraar diya he
 He said that this tax being taken in the name of cleanliness from the Hindus is like the Jajiya tax of the Mughal period

 Hence the municipality will execute the cleaning system by putting employees on contract with this tax

 ROCK-STEADY!— taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)november 2, 2016karan johar kifilm 'i dil he mushkil'film main fawaad ke saath-saath aishwarya raay bachchan, ranbir kapur or anoushka sharma ahm bhoomikaaon main hai, jo diwali se thik pehle shuukravaar ko relies hui
 The film was released in around 3000 theaters in India
 gauratlab he ki film kii relies se pehle ajay devgan ne aarope lagaaya tha ki kamaal raashid khan (keaarke) ne karan johar kii film'i dil he mushkil'ke paksh main twit karne ke liye karan se 25 lakh rupee liye the
 At the same time, Kamal says that Devgan offered him money to criticize Karan Johar's film
 lagaataar do maichon main sharmnaak haar jhelane ke baad clinasweep kaa dansh jhelane ke kagaar par khadi bhartiya team ravivaar ko tisare or aakhri ekadivasiy antarrashtriya cricket match main pratishtha bachaane or pakistan kii 3-0 se shrinkhalaa jeetne kii ummiido par pani pherane ke liye firozshah kotla maidan par utregi
 Having lost eight wickets in Chennai and 85 runs in Kolkata, India will have to do well if the batsmen have to avoid the shame of losing all the matches of a bilateral series on their own
 bharat ke nami ballebaajon ne pichley do maichon main lachar khel dikhaakar captain mahendra singh dhoni sahit desh ke karodon cricket premiyon ko bhi niraash kiya
 India had earlier lost 0–5 to the West Indies on their soil in 1983
 pakistan ke bhi kuch ballebaaj visheshkar nasir jamshed lagaataar acha pradarshan kar paye hai lekin uski tej gendbaaji kii tikdi junayd khan, mohammad irfan or umr gul ne antar paidaa kiya he
 All three have played a key role in shaking the Indian top order so far
 pakistani akraman ke saamne captain dhoni ko chhodkar koi bhi bhartiya ballebaaj krij par zyada der tak nahin tik paaya
 Delhi's top three batsmen Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli have so far scored 35, 19 and six runs respectively in two matches
 in teenon se team hi nahin bhartiya cricket premiyon ko bhi apane gharelu maidan par achche pradarshan kii ummid rahegi
 Dhoni has also admitted that at least one of these three top-order batsmen will have to support the middle-order batsmen
 bharat ke liye chintaa kii baat yah he ki sheersh kram main sahvaag, gambhir or kohli ke naakaam hone ke baad madhyakram main yuvaraj singh, rohit sharma or suresh raina main se bhi koi ankar kii bhoomika nahin nibhaa paaya he
 Therefore, not only the Indian team but also the reputation of Indian batsmen is at stake in this match
 dhoni kii farm jarur bharat ke liye acchhee khabar he
 The Indian captain scored 113 not out in the first match and 54 not out in the second match but he could not get support from the other end
 pakistan kii nigaah 14veen baar teen yaa isse adhik maichon kii shrinkhalaa main clinasweep karne par lagi hai
 Pakistan has so far managed to win all the matches of the series in Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and West Indies so far
 uske captain misabah ul haq ne bhi kaha ki team kotla main match jeetne main koi kasar nahin chhodeygi
 Misbah said that any win against India is special
 yadi ham 3-0 se jeetne main kaamyaab rahe to yah badi uplabdhi hogi
 If the bowlers have made the main difference for Pakistan, then its opener Jamshed took over the batting department in both the matches
 chennai main 101 or kolkata main 106 ran banane vaale jamshed kii nigaah lagaataar teen maichon main shatak jadne ke jahir abbaas or said anwar ke ricard kii barabari karne par lagi he
 Zaheer did this feat against India in 1982-83
 bhartiya gendbaaj bhi kolkata main aakhri 25 overon se prerana lene kii koshish karenge jinamein unhone pakistan kii puri team ko samet diya tha
 The Indian fast bowling trio of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ashok Dinda and Ishant Sharma also need to take lessons from the Pakistani bowlers
 kotla kii pich main vaise chepak yaa eden gardens kii tarah adhik teji or oochaal milane kii sambhaavna nahin he or isliye yahaan bharat spin vibhaag ko majboot karne par jor de saktaa he
 However, there is no possibility of any change in the Pakistan bowling attack as it has two useful spinners in the form of Saeed Ajmal and Hafeez
 uttar bharat main sardi kaa mausam he or match 12 baje shuru hone ke baavjood pich main nami rahegi
 In such a situation, the toss will play an important role again
 aisi sthiti main shuru main tej gendbaajon ko madad mil sakati he or yahaan bhi toss jeetne vaali team ke pehle kshetrarakshan karne kii hi sambhaavna he
 As far as the record is concerned, the only ODI match between India and Pakistan in Kotla was played in 2005 in which Pakistan won
 sambhavit donon timen is prakaar hai

 But he is finding it difficult to reach the hospital
 kisi ko ye samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki karen to kya karen
 How to transport a woman to the hospital
 baadh kii vajah se gaanv se nikalne kaa koi rasta najar nahin aa rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, a young man from the same village Kesanjeet Paswannam reported this to the NDRF team
 soochna milte hi andiaref kii team rupas maanjhi gaanv pahunchi
 Neetu Devi was taken out of the house by NDRF personnel and boarded the boat and brought out of the village
 gaanv se baahar laane ke baad samay par ambulance nahin aane par andiaref ke javaanon ne anchaladhikari bakhtiyarpur ke sarkari vaahan se nitu devi ko bakhtiyarpur sadahospatalapahunchaaya
 After being taken to the hospital, the team of doctors started treating Neetu Devi and Neetu gave birth to a baby boy who is absolutely healthy
 pichley paanch dinon se patna or aasapaas ke baadh kii tabaahi kaa dansh jhel rahe hai
 The flood victims are trying to save their lives and the NDRF team is helping them all
 inhen sab main baadh ke bhubaneshwar paswan kii kahani hi kuch alag he, yahaan bhi agar andiaref kii team naa hoti to pataa nahin bhubaneshwar ko or kitne dinon tak ped par hi bhukhe–pyaase din gujaarna padataa
 Bhubaneswar has been sitting on a hungry-thirsty tree for the last 72 hours to save his life in a naked state
 andiaref kii team apni naav lekar us ore se ja rahe the ki bhubaneshwar ne aawaaj lagaakar apni jaan bachaane ke liye guhaar lagaai
 Hearing the sound of Bhubaneswar, the NDRF jawans reached the tree with the boat
 pehle pahanane ke liye bhubaneshwar ko kapade die gaye phir andiaref ke javaanon ne use ped se neeche utaara, phir andiaref kii team ne bhubaneshwar ko paas ke raahat camp main pahunchaa diya
 Now Bhubaneshwar is searching for his family
 darasal shanivaar kii raat baadh kaa pani bhubaneshwar ke ghar main ghusane se afratfari much gai or sabhi ghar se bhaagane lage
 Bhubaneswar also ran
 lekin tej nahin bhaag paane ke kaaran pani bhubaneshwar ko apni agosh main lene laga jisase usase kapade bah gaye
 The edge of the water was so sharp that he could not understand what to do if he did
 in sabake bich use ek ped najar aayaa jisapar wo apni jaan bachaane ke liye chadh gaya or pichley 72 ghante se usee ped par baadh kaa pani pikar wo jindagi or maut se jujh rahaa tha

 com / gqjglgag0f All India Majlise Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president and MP Asaduddin Owaisi has said that the BJP is silent on Section 370 in Jammu and Kashmir because it wants to get the votes of Muslims in the current assembly elections
 ovaisi ne aaj tak ke program 'sidhi baat' ke dauraan yah baat kahi
 Asaduddin Owaisi said that his opinion about Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the same today, and it will never change
 ovaisi ne aam chunaav ke dauraan bhi kaha tha ki modi pradhanmantri banate hai, to desh ke liye yah acha nahin hoga
 Owaisi said, 'I still stand by that statement
 unke mantriyon ke bayaan sun hi rahe hai ki ve kis jubaan or andaaj main baat kar rahe hai
 Sakshi Maharaj said that all madrasas are terrorism factories
 phir lav-jihad kii baat failaakar logon ko bhadakaane kii koshish kii gai
 On the other hand, the statement of the RSS that we will create a Hindu nation
 2019 se pehle ham ram mandir banaaenge
 Then on 15 August Modi asked the Red Fort to give me a 10-year mortuary
 ab mulk ko faisla karnaa he
 People have voted for him
 unhen mubarak! magar hamaari raay jo aaj he, vahi kal bhi rahegi
 When asked if the BJP is silent on issues such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) and Article 370 and the Ram temple, its focus is only on good governance and development, and Hindutva does not seem to be on its agenda
 is par aap kya kahenge?ovaisi ne kaha, 'anuchhed 370 radd karne kii baat bijepi ne apane kor agenda se hataai nahin he
 He is still silent on the issue to win elections in Kashmir
 bijepi saaf-saaf nahin kahati ki anuchhed 370 yaa ram mandir kii baat vah bhul gai he
 She cannot even say so, because she has thought of taking advantage of the two way
 'unhone kaha, 'agar AFSPA hataanaa he, to ve sansad main vidheyak lekar aaen
 Remove AFSPA at least from the urban areas of Kashmir
 sansad kaa satr abhi jari he
 But these people will not do anything like this
 mujhe to lagata he, jammu main antim charan kaa matdaan ho jane ke baad bijepi apana asli cheharaa dikhaaegi
 Owaisi was asked the question that the Prime Minister himself is not speaking anything on controversial issues
 What is your reaction to this? In response, Owaisi said, 'everyone's work in the BJP is divided
 aresas he, vihip he, bajrang dal he or bijepi in sabaki ek raajnneetik shakha he
 For political gains, it has been his nature to make vague statements to deceive people
 pradhanmantri kabhi aresas ke hindu raashtra vaale bayaan ke khilaaf nahin ja sakate
 The Prime Minister himself says that he has come from the RSS
 modi neuyork main kehete hai ki 1200 saal kii gulaami se aazaadee mili he
 The country was liberated in 1947
 magar ye 650 saal kii mughaliya hukumat or usase pehle lodhi kii baat karte hai, kya ye gulaami thi? dekhie, kis tarah ke bayaan aa rahe hai
 "the Congress and NCP allege that your party is benefiting from the bjp's election
 unka to yahaan tak kahana he ki aap aresas kii shah par chunaav main utre?' is sawaal par ovaisi ne kaha, 'maharashtra main kul ek karod musalmaan matadaata hai
 The turnout was 60 percent
 yani 60 lakh musalamaanon ne vot die
 i fielded 24 candidates
 paanch gaiyr-muslim bhi the
 i got a total of five lakh 24 thousand Muslim votes
 baaki 55 lakh muslim vot kaha gaye
 The Congress and NCP got all the votes

 One percent of Muslim girls are also not graduates
 halaat kahaan badale? or ummidavaar utaaro, to kehete hai aresas ke paas chale gaye
 Unfortunately, if the BJP says that i am a nationalist and other parties give certificates, then i am secular
 ''kya aapako lagata he ki aane vaale chaar-paanch saal main muslim vot aapke irdagird ikaitha hoga?' is sawaal par ovaisi ne kaha, 'main musalamaanon kaa netaa nahin hum
 The leaders of the Muslims are Pandit Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Manmohan Singh, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Sharad Pawar
 'ovaisi se sawaal kiya gaya, 'muslim naujavaanon main lagbhag aath-das fisadi kaa rujhaan bijepi kii taraf he, kyonki modi aaj vikaas kii baaten kar rahe hai
 Are you afraid of closing your political shop? On this Owaisi said, 'no one can stop anyone from voting
 lekin yah iljaam bebuniyaad he
 Of the bjp's 440 candidates, only eight were Muslims, and all lost
 bijepi shahanvaj hossain ko kyon nahin jitwa pai, jawaab de
 The bail of the remaining seven was forfeited
 vah isliye ki log bijepi or aresas kii vichaardhaara jaanate hai
 Not all people can get into the hoax
 'pakistan ke prati pradhanmantri ke ravaie par ovaisi ne kaha, 'hamaare pados main har taraf asthirataa he
 There was firing on the outskirts

 See how this tension is reduced
 dakshes ke aakhri din pradhanmantri ne navaj sharif se haath milaayaa
 Now let us see if the avenues of conversation also open
 'sawaal kiya gaya, 'kya aapako lagata he iesas internet ke jariye yuvaaon ko bhatka paaegi?' iske jawaab main ovaisi ne kaha, 'iesas kii aalochana maine hi nahin, bade-bade muslim vidwaanon ne bhi kii
 It is a blot on the name of Islam

 We do not want to see any force flourishing that threatens the integrity of the country

 rape ke aarope se ghire maharashtra ke diaiji sunil parskar ke samarthan main shivasena utarati najar aa rahi he
 Uddhav Thackeray has written in 'saamana' that a mere accusation of a model does not make a respected police officer a villain
 uddhav thakare ne yah bhi sawaal uthaaya he ki model ne rape kaa aarope aakhir 6 maheene baad kyon lagaaya? unhone sawaal kiya ki kya model ko yah samajhane main 6 maheene lag gaye ki uske saath rape hua he?uddhav ne saamana main likhaa he ki diaiji parskar kaa charitra hanan kiya ja rahaa he
 He has also questioned the model's background

 After this, the DIG took wrong advantage of him
 unhone dhire-dhire us model se dosti kii or phir uskaa rape kar diya

 pakistan kaa kahana he ki kashmir or nadi jal bantwaaraa samet tamaam ‘buniyadi’ dwipaksheeya muddon ke samaadhaan ke liye vishwa samudaay ko bharat ko raji karana chahie

 pakistani pradhanmantri usoof raja gilaani ne kaha, ‘ham bharat or anya padosiyon ke saath bahut achche sambandh kaayam rakhana chaahate hai

 "we should focus more on the poor people of both the countries," Gilani said

 By the way, tension between the state president and CM is not new in Delhi
 ek samay apane tisare kaarykaal main shila dikshit or pradesh adhyaksh jaiprakash agarwal ke bich baatcheet tak nahin hoti thi
 The same situation was also there when Ram Babu Sharma was the state president

 There was a long list of people angry with Hooda in Haryana
 kai netaa isi vajah se chunaav ke dauraan ghar baith gaye to kuch bijepi main chale gaye

 lekin, ab rahul gandhi ke is faisle kaa phayda hota he yaa nuksaan iske liye intjaar karnaa hoga kyonki dilli main congress ke aath vidhayakon main chaar muslim or ek sikh he
 If the Congress increases its strength by eight, this decision of Rahul Gandhi will be appreciated or else another criticism

 On the other hand, a gathering of climbers from all over the world at Everest Base Camp
 sab duniya ke sabase oonche shikhar ko fatah karne kii taiyaari main the
 ndtv's team with the Indian Army Expeditionary Team led by Major RS Jamwal headed to Khumbhu Glacier for practice, when suddenly the earth trembled with a rippling sound
 chaaron ore hadakamp much gaya
 a terrible storm shook the whole of Nepal
 himalay kii chotiyaan bhi tharra uthin
 Aamir Rafiq of NDTV present on Everest said, Earthquake happened first
 base camp ke around jitne bhi mountains hai, glacier hai
 
 
 When they broke the glacier and rained together on the base camp, all the tents were destroyed
 chaaron taraf laashen or khun
 
 
 
 sirf vahi kapade bache, jo hamane pahane the
 We have nothing left
 jindagi se jang : yahaan dekhie puraa video Snow storms descended from the peaks around Everest Base Camp
 pumori peak se himkhand tuutakar neeche kii ore phisalane lage
 Aamir Rafiq of NDTV said that right now we were with 30 people of Indian Army at Everest Base Camp
 ham base camp-1 tak hi gaye the
 While we were returning, the Khumbhu Glacier, which is considered the most dangerous world, started moving
 hamaare left-rhite donon sids se himaskhalan hone laga or puri army kii team jo major jamwaal kii leadership main thi, kaha ki aap rope pakadakar rakho or neeche raho
 We stayed for two minutes and waited for some time
 
 
 
 We are about to die now
 
 
 tabhi kisi ne kaha, bhaago-bhaago
 
 
 
 khumbhu glacier kii dhalaan par barf kii safed chadar dekhte hi dekhte kai jagah se fatne lagi
 Solid snow began to sink under the feet
 koi bhi him daraar parvatarohiyon ko nigal sakati thi
 It took both speed and patience to get out of the midst of this white death on the way
 tabhi upar se barf kaa toofaan guzara
 
 
 
 aamir ne bataaya, jab ham neeche bhaag rahe the to neeche bhaagane ke saath barf kaa tufaan aayaa, jisaki vajah se hamen neeche baithna padaa or hamane apana munh dhakaa
 When we opened our eyes after five minutes, we had five to ten inches of snow
 ab ham neeche bhaag-bhaag ke aae, jab ham base camp par pahunche, vahaan par hamaare rakesh solanki sar the, jinhone base camp ko cover kiya
 The avalanche that took place at the base camp landed and landed at the base camp
 
 
 aamir ne kaha, hamen do minute ke liye laga jaise ham aankh band karke maut kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 When you are standing on the Khumbu Glacier and there are rocks of snow falling around you and the glacier you are standing on is also shaking, then you can imagine how close we have seen to death
 bhartiya sena main major jamwaal ne bataaya, jab ham neeche pahunche to hamane dekha sab safaa he
 there's nothing left
 hamaara khud kaa kuch nahin bachaa tha
 We have HRA on our side, Casualties started frequenting there
 everest base camp par chaaron ore cheekh pukaar machi thi
 Rakesh Solanki told, We were seven to eight people down
 tabhi qareeb 12:40 par arthquek aa gaya
 As we got out of the tent and were watching, i started shooting out by taking out the camera that in that way a mountain of snow was broken very near to us and it started coming towards us
 ham usee vaqt camera vahiin chhodkar apni jaan bachaane ke liye daude
 i found a small rock
 uske peeche main baith gaya
 i and a Sherpa survived there
 hamaare upar puraa tents aakar gir gaya, isi vajah se hamaara shelter ho gaya or ham batch gaye
 As soon as that was over, we immediately took out the camera
 shoot karnaa start kiya tha to dekha sab tabah ho chukaa tha or base camp main bahut hi bure haal the
 Many people were injured, around 22 people were killed due to head injuries
 major jamwaal ne bataaya ki kisi ne ye expect nahin kiya tha ki base camp ke andar vah bhi pumori se aisa himaskhalan hoga, jo base camp ko uda ke le jayega
 After this, Mount Everest Base Camp was scattered
 parvatarohiyon ke tambu barf ke toofaan main ujaad chuke the
 Everything from food to drink to mountaineering was buried in ice somewhere hundreds of meters away
 phir ghayalon ke aane kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 The expedition team of the Indian Army immediately engaged in relief and rescue
 major jamwaal ne bataaya, hamane apane aapako do tiimon main baanta
 i made a doctor's team
 uske saath aath bande baante
 
 
 And i engaged the rest of the team to find our luggage, which was very important, because our everything had flown
 darasal, toofaan main bikhri chizein jutanaa zaruri tha
 These goods were the door to keep the lives alive there
 ghayalon kaa ilaaj bhi tabhi ho paata
 The army team collected everything one by one
 nae sire se tambu lagaae gaye
 The field hospital of the Indian Army was started shortly
 major jamwaal ke mutabik, davaaiyaan hamaare paas bahut thi
 We had more medicines than HRA
 hamaare paas bahut kaabil doctor the or unhone bahut help kii
 Our doctor was with the injured all night
 vah sir kii choton kaa department sambhaal rahe the, jo ek main department tha, kyonki adhiktar parvatarohiyon ko sir par chot lagi thi
 The snowstorm that he brought by breaking rocks and stones
 iske baad helicopteron ke jariye jin parvatarohiyon ko gambhir chotein ain, unhen turant rajdhani kathmandu yaa sabase qareeb lukala ke aspataal bhejne kaa kaam shuru hua
 After the avalanche, many Sherpas at the base camp left their teams and withdrew
 isaki do vajah raheen
 One is that out of the 22 climbers killed in the avalanche, 16 were Sherpas and the other was the devastation in Nepal in which many houses were broken
 aamir ne bataaya ki uske baad jab ham neeche aae to neeche utarate hi jitne bhi sherpa the, saare ke saare sherpa base camp chhodkar nikalne lage, kyonki pichley saal himaskhalan main 16 sherpa kii mautein huin thim
 The same thing happened this year
 19 main se 16 sherpa the
 When all the Sherpas started running, only the climbers were left
 parvatarohiyon ko utani jaankaree nahin hoti
 Meanwhile, many foreign mountaineer teams have still not returned to the base camp, which climbers had climbed towards Everest a couple of days before, all were waiting for them
 everest kaa base camp, camp van camp tu se cat chukaa tha
 Everyone was in a hurry to return, if not the Indian Army expedition
 aamir ne bataaya ki bhartiya sena ne yahaan great role nibhaayaa
 They could also leave, but did not leave, because those who were trapped there, it was necessary to find relief by finding them first, because no one had any food and drink left
 sirf indian army ke paas jo khaanaa bachaa tha vah baanta gaya
 The Indian Army front with some foreign climbers at the base camp
 everest base camp par zindagi kii jang jari thi
 Those who survived the snow storm landed at Everest Base Camp, thanking God
 is bich ek ke baad ek aa rahe chote bukamp rah rahakar sabko daraa rahe the
 With the earthquake, everyone's eyes would go to the higher peaks to see if death was coming down in the shape of snow storm
 major jamwaal ne bataaya, hamane santari duty par lagaae hue hai
 If there is such a voice, on all three sides, you can talk about Pomori, you can talk about Lola or Nubsey, which way Avalansh will come, these boys will warn us
 pehla din jaise-taise guzara
 The next morning, the work of evacuating the survivors resumed
 is bich dopaher main ek or bada bukamp sabko dahala gaya
 After the earth, it was now the turn of the sky
 base camp ko badalon ne gher liya or barfabaari shuru ho gai
 Aamir told that it was snowing continuously
 har din or raat ko traders aa rahe the
 The Indian Army employed three sentries, who lived around the camp overnight
 jyon hi avalanche kii awaz aa rahi hoti to ve hamen chilla ke bolte the, baahar niklo
 
 
 So we used to find shelter
 pathar ke saamne jhuk jate the
 The comments dhire-dhire base camp par bachi tiimon ne apana abhiyaan sametanaa shuru kiya, lekin bhartiya sena kaa abhiyaan dal base camp par raahat or bachaav ke kaam main ab bhi juta tha
 Meanwhile, the time has come for our return from base camp
 bhare man ke saath hamane vahaan maujuud saathiyon se vidaa lee
 That dark memory of Everest Base Camp on April 25, 2015 will always be fresh in the mind, but we will return with a new spirit, a new place, a new height
 
 
 everest par maujuud enditivi ke aamir rafik ne bataaya, pehle arthquek hua
 All the mountains around the base camp are glaciers
 
 
 ve glacier tut kar ek saath base camp ke upar baras pade to jitne bhi tents the, sab dhwast ho gaye
 Corpses and blood everywhere
 
 
 
 Only the clothes we wore were left
 hamaare paas kuch nahin bachaa
 Jeevan se jung: Watch the full video here everest base camp ke aasapaas shikharon se barf kaa toofaan neeche utarane laga
 The iceberg broke from Pumori Peak and started sliding downwards
 enditivi ke aamir rafique ne bataaya ki abhi ham everest base camp par bhartiya sena ke 30 logon ke saath the
 We went to Base Camp-1 only
 jab ham waapas aa rahe the, itane main khumbhu glacier, jo sabase dangeras world main maane jate hai, ve hilne lage
 There was an avalanche from both our left and right sides and the entire army team which was under the leadership of Major Jamwal said that you hold the rope and stay down
 ham do minute tak rahe or kuch der intjaar karte rahe
 
 
 
 abhi ham marane vaale hai
 
 
 Then someone said, run away
 
 
 
 On seeing the white sheet of ice on the slope of Khumbu Glacier, it started bursting from many places
 pairon ke neeche thos barf dhansane lagi
 Any snow crack could swallow the climbers
 raste main bichhi is safed maut ke bich se nikalne ke liye tezi or sabar donon kii zarurat thi
 That's when the snowstorm passed from above
 
 
 
 Aamir told, when we were running down, a snow storm came with the run down, due to which we had to sit down and we covered our mouths
 jab hamane paanch minute ke baad apni ankhen kholin to hamaare upar paanch se das inch tak barf jamaa thi
 Now we came downstairs, when we reached the base camp, there was our Rakesh Solanki sir, who covered the base camp
 base camp main jo upar se himaskhalan hua tha, vah utarkar base camp par aa gaya
 
 
 Aamir said, for two minutes we felt like we were waiting for death with our eyes closed
 khumbhu glacier par jab aap khadey hon or aapke chaaron ore se barf kii chattaane gir rahi hon or aap jis glacier par khadey hon, vah bhi hill rahaa he to aap soch sakate hai hamane maut ko kitne qareeb se dekha he
 Major Jamwal in the Indian Army said, when we reached the bottom, we saw everything was safe
 kuch nahin bachaa he
 We had nothing left of ourselves
 hamaari bagal main echaare he, vahaan par cazmultiz lagaataar aani shuru ho gai thim
 There was a scream around Everest Base Camp
 rakesh solanki ne bataaya, ham saat se aath log neeche the
 Then at around 12:40 Earthquake arrived
 jaise ham log baahar tent se nikle or dekh hi rahe the, maine camera nikaal kar shooting karnaa shuru hi kiya tha ki utane main hamaare saamne bahut nazadik puraa barf kaa ek pahaad tut chukaa tha or vah hamaari taraf aane laga
 We left the camera right then and ran to save our lives
 mujhe ek choti-si chattan mil gai
 i sat behind him
 vahaan par main or ek sherpa bache
 The whole tent came and fell on us, that is why our shelter was done and we were saved
 vah sab jaise hi khatm hua to turant hamane camera nikaala
 When i started shooting, i saw everything was destroyed and the base camp was in very bad condition
 bahut zyada log ghayal hue the, sir kii choton se qareeb 22 log maare ja chuke the
 Major Jamwal said that no one had expected that inside the base camp, that too would be an avalanche from Pumori that would blow up the base camp
 iske baad mount everest base camp bikharaa padaa tha
 The climbers' tents were devastated by the snowstorm
 khaane-pine se lekar parvatarohan tak kaa saamaan saikadon meter dur kahin barf main dab chukaa tha
 Then the process of the arrival of the injured started
 bhartiya sena kaa abhiyaan dal turant raahat or bachaav main jute gaya
 Major Jamwal told that, we divided ourselves into two teams
 maine ek doctor kii team banaai
 He shared eight men with him
 
 
 or baaki team ko maine apana saamaan dhundne ke liye lagaaya, jo ki bahut jaruri tha, kyonki hamaara sab kuch ud chukaa tha
 Actually, it was necessary to collect scattered things in the storm
 ye saamaan vahaan maujuud jidangiyon ko bachaae rakhane kii door tha
 Only the injured could be treated
 sena kii team ne ek-ek kar sab jutaya
 Tents were renovated
 kuch hi der main bhartiya sena kaa field hospital shuru ho gaya tha
 According to Major Jamwal, we had a lot of medicines
 echaare se bhi zyaada davaaiyaan hamaare paas thi
 We had very capable doctors and they helped a lot
 puri raat hamaara doctor ghayalon saath rahaa
 He was handling the head injuries department, which was a main department, as most of the climbers suffered head injuries
 barf kaa toofaan apane saath chattaane or pathar todakar jo laayaa tha
 After this, the work of sending climbers who received serious injuries through helicopters immediately sent them to the capital Kathmandu or the nearest hospital in Lukla
 himaskhalan ke baad base camp par maujuud kai sherpa apni tiimon ko chhodkar waapas nikal gaye
 There were two reasons for this
 ek to ye ki himaskhalan main maare gaye 22 parvatarohiyon main se 16 sherpa the or doosraa nepal main ai tabaahi main kaiyon ke ghar afat tut padi thi
 Aamir told that after that when we came down, all the Sherpas were leaving the base camp as soon as we came down, because last year there were 16 Sherpa deaths in the avalanche
 is saal bhi vahi hua
 16 out of 19 were Sherpas
 saare ke saare sherpa jab bhaagane lage to saare parvatarohi hi bache rah gaye
 Climbers don't know that much
 is bich kai videshi parvatarohiyon kii timen ab bhi base camp par nahin lauti thim, jo parvatarohi ek do din pehle hi everest kii ore chadhaai kar chuke the, sabko unka intazaar tha
 Everest's base camp was cut from Camp One Camp Two
 sabko waapas lautne kii jaldi thi, nahin thi to sirf bhartiya sena ke abhiyaan dal ko
 Aamir told that the Indian Army played a great role here
 ve bhi nikal sakate the, lekin nahin nikle, kyonki vahaan par jo log fanse hue the, pehle unhen dhundhakar kar raahat pahunchnaa jaruri tha, kyonki kisi ke paas koi khaanaa-pinaa nahin bachaa tha
 Only the food that was left with the Indian Army was distributed
 base camp par kuch videshi parvatarohiyon ke saath bhartiya sena morcha sanbhale rahi
 The war of life continued at Everest Base Camp
 everest base camp par utre barf ke toofaan main jo batch gaye wo bhagwaan kaa shukriya adaa kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, small earthquakes coming one after the other were frightening everyone
 bukamp ke saath hi sabaki nigaah oonchi chotiyon par chali jaati ye dekhne ke liye ki kahin phir maut barf ke toofaan kii shakl main neeche to nahin utar rahi
 Major Jamwal told, we are on sentry duty
 agar koi aisi awaz aati he, teenon taraf, aap pomori kii baat kar sakate hai, lola kii baat kar sakate hai yaa nubse kii, jis taraf se bhi avalanche aayega, ye ladke hamen saavdhaan karenge
 The first day passed as usual
 agali subah bache hue logon ko nikaalane kaa kaam phir shuru hua
 Meanwhile, in the afternoon another big earthquake shook everyone
 dharti ke baad ab aasmaan kii baari thi
 The base camp was surrounded by clouds and snowfall started
 aamir ne bataaya ki lagaataar barfbaari ho rahi tha
 Tremors were coming in every day and night
 bhartiya sena teen santariyon ko lagaakar rakhti thi, jo raat bhar camp ke aasapaas rahete the
 As soon as the voice of Evlansh was coming, they used to shout at us, get out
 
 
 to ham shelter dhundte the
 Used to bow in front of the stone
 tippaniyan Gradually, the remaining teams at the base camp began to consolidate their operations, but the Indian Army expedition was still engaged in relief and rescue work at the base camp
 is bich base camp se hamaare lautne kaa vaqt bhi aa gaya
 With good heart, we bid farewell to the colleagues present there
 25 april, 2015 ko everest base camp kii wo syah yaad hameshaa dimaag main tazaa rahegi, lekin ham lautenge ek nae haunsale ke saath, ek nayaa mukaam, ek nai oonchai hasil karne ke liye
 
 
 Jeevan se jung: Watch the full video here everest base camp ke aasapaas shikharon se barf kaa toofaan neeche utarane laga
 The iceberg broke from Pumori Peak and started sliding downwards
 enditivi ke aamir rafique ne bataaya ki abhi ham everest base camp par bhartiya sena ke 30 logon ke saath the
 We went to Base Camp-1 only
 jab ham waapas aa rahe the, itane main khumbhu glacier, jo sabase dangeras world main maane jate hai, ve hilne lage
 There was an avalanche from both our left and right sides and the entire army team which was under the leadership of Major Jamwal said that you hold the rope and stay down
 ham do minute tak rahe or kuch der intjaar karte rahe
 
 
 
 abhi ham marane vaale hai
 
 
 Then someone said, run away
 
 
 
 On seeing the white sheet of ice on the slope of Khumbu Glacier, it started bursting from many places

 Snow storms descended from the peaks around Everest Base Camp
 pumori peak se himkhand tuutakar neeche kii ore phisalane lage
 Aamir Rafiq of NDTV said that right now we were with 30 people of Indian Army at Everest Base Camp
 ham base camp-1 tak hi gaye the
 While we were returning, the Khumbhu Glacier, which is considered the most dangerous world, started moving
 hamaare left-rhite donon sids se himaskhalan hone laga or puri army kii team jo major jamwaal kii leadership main thi, kaha ki aap rope pakadakar rakho or neeche raho
 We stayed for two minutes and waited for some time
 
 
 
 We are about to die now
 
 
 tabhi kisi ne kaha, bhaago-bhaago
