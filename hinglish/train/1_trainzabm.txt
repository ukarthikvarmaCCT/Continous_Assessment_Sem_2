 In this film, Deepika Padukone in the role of Rani Padmavati is neither in a Rajput dress nor does she look like a Rajput Virangana

 They allege that what has been shown in Taylor itself is not correct

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said the team lacked the experienced Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman to face the Dale Steyn-led South African pace attack
 sten ne match main das wicket liye jisamen unhone pehali pari main 51 ran dekar saat wicket hasil kiye jo unke karier kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan bhi he
 This enabled South Africa to win the first Test by an innings and six runs
 dhoni ne kaha ki is tej gendbaaj ne unki team ko tahas nahas kar diya
 Dhoni said at the press conference after the match, "dale Steyn collapsed with both his traditional and reverse swing
" hamen rahul or lakshmana kii kami khali lekin choton ke saath ham kuch nahin kar sakate
 Rohit Sharma (joined the team to cover Laxman) was injured 15 minutes before the toss
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘murali vijay ne number teen par acchhee bhoomika nibhaai tathaa es badrinaath or vriddhimaan saaha ko antarrashtriya cricket main khilne kaa mauka mila
 Dhoni admitted that his team proved to be nineteen in every department by South Africa
 unhone kaha, ‘dakshin africa ne hamen har vibhaag main maat di
 The way Steyn bowled it made a difference in the match
 hamane (kal) chaay ke vishram tak acha khel dikhaaya lekin gend badalane ke baad vah reverse hone lagi lekin sten ko shrey jaataa he
 He had bowled 12-15 overs even before changing the ball and still bowled well
 ’kolkata main ravivaar se shuru hone vaale duusare test main lakshmana ke khilne kii sambhaavna ke bare main dhoni ne kaha, ‘vah lagaataar net par abhyaas kar rahe hai or guuruuvaar tak hi tasviir saaf ho paaegi
 Regarding Steyn's bowling, Dhoni said that such traditional swing has not been seen on Indian pitches for some time
 unhone kaha, ‘sten ne bharat main haal ke vashren main paaramparik swing kaa behtareen najaara pesh kiya
 We have seen reverse swing after the ball has become old, but here was a bowler who benefited from the traditional swing
 ’ sten ko baayen haath ke spinner paal haris kaa acha sahyog mila or dhoni ne kaha ki agle match main ballebaaj un par haaavee hone kii koshish karenge
 The Indian captain said, "he is a bowler who can give only 50 runs after 30 overs
 uske khilaaf ran bananaa aasaan nahin hota he
 He does not turn the ball but uses the rough area at the crease from the bowler's feet
 ham us par adhik shaat khilne kii koshish karenge
 In the absence of Dravid and Laxman, India had high hopes from Virender Sehwag
 unhone pehali pari main 109 ran banaaye lekin duusari pari main 16 ran banaakar out ho gayi
 Dhoni, however, defended Sehwag
 unhone kaha, ‘sahvaag match vijeta he or hamaare liye unhone kai match jite hai
 You may remember that he won us a year and a half ago against England in Chennai
 jab vah aakraamak kheltaa he to apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karata he or virdohi team ko dabaav main rakhata he

 'tendulkar ke do din pehle die gaye ek bayaan par vivaad ho gaya

 tendulkar ne bengaluru main karnataka rajya cricket sangh ke platinum jubilee samaaroh main shanivaar ko kaha tha, 'main duuradrushti ke bare main baat kar rahaa hum
 The player must be analyzed when it comes to selection
 agar koi khilaadi kuch maichon main asafal bhi rahaa ho, phir bhi yah dekhnaa chahie ki kya vah antarrashtriya str par dabaav sah saktaa he

 cricket ke mahakumbh yani vishwa cap kii shuruyaat bhale hi aaj se 36 saal pehle hui lekin isaki neenv lagbhag 100 saal purv 1912 main rakh di gai thi
 It is a matter of those days when the first two World Cup champions West Indies and then the title winning India did not play international cricket
 us samay simit overon kii cricket nahin thi or keval teen timen australia, england or dakshin africa test match khelti thi
 Therefore, a triangular tournament of Test cricket was played between these three teams from 27 May to 22 August 1912
 is tarah ke toornament kaa prastaav imperial cricket parishad :jo baad antarrashtriya cricket parishad bani: ne july 1909 main apni pehali baithak main rakhaa tha
 However, due to bad weather and lack of competitive cricket, the tournament was not successful and no such competitions were held, but it became a guide for such tournaments including the World Cup
 iske baad jab 1960 main simit overon ke cricket kii shuruyaat hui to kai tiimon ke bich toornament yojit karne kii ummid bandha gai
 The knockout tournament between the county teams in England put wings on this expectation as the women cricketer became the inspiration for the men who played the first World Cup in 1973 to pave the way for the Men's World Cup
 mahila vishwa cap vyavsaayee jaik heward ke dimag kii upaj tha
 He then spent 40, 000 pounds on this tournament

 pehla ekadivasiy match paanch janvari 1971 ko australia or england ke bich melbern main khelaa gaya tha jiske chaar saal baad england main shuruaati vishwa cap kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 In England itself, then there was the infrastructure to organize such big tournaments, so it hosted not only 1975 but also the 1979 and 1983 World Cups
 westeindies 1975 or 1979 main pehle donon vishwa cap jeetne main safal rahaa jabaki 1983 main bharat ne champion banakar puure cricket jagat ko hairaan kar diya tha
 The World Cup was first held jointly in 1987 in India and Pakistan out of England in which Australia managed to win their first title
 australia ko pehali baar 1992 main mejabani kaa mauka mila jahaan pakistan champion rahaa
 The Sri Lankan team won the title when India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka hosted it in 1996
 iske baad 1999 main england, 2003 main dakshin africa or 2007 main westeindies main yojit kiye gaye vishwa cap main australia champion bana
 Now the World Cup is being held jointly in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, while in 2015 it will be hosted by Australia and New Zealand

 co / kooirnk4ue uttar pradesh main bhartiya janata party kii badi jeet ke baad samaajawaadee party satta se baahar ho gai he
 Under Akhilesh's leadership, the party has reached the lowest number of mlas in its 25-year history
 sapa is baar sirf 47 vidhayakon ke saath hi vidhansabha main pravesh karegi
 After the defeat, all the peace is so great, there is an atmosphere of peace in the Samajwadi Party clan
 haar ke baad akhilesh ne press conference kar haar kii jimmedaari lee thi, vahiin mulaayam singh yadav or shivpal yadav ne bhi haar sweekaari thi, or kaha tha ki ham haar kii samiksha karenge
 Everyone celebrated Holi very recently
 Before the Holi Samajwadi Party patron Mulayam Singh Yadav went to the Janeshwar Mishra Trust in Lucknow for the first time after the results of the election, it was the sp-congress war room during office elections
 mulaayam singh ne apane awaas par aae sapa samarthakon se mulaakaat kii, vah vahaan paanch minute ke liye ruke or phir vahaan se chale gaye
 At the same time, Akhilesh Yadav also came there and touched his father's feet and went away
 iske baad mulaayam singh sidhaa apane paitruk gaanv saifai ravaanaa hue, mulaayam helicopter ke jariye saifai gayi, vahiin akhilesh apane parivaar ke saath agra-lakhanu express-ve saifai gayi the
 At the time of Saifai's departure, he also got many supporters, so he said that there is no need to panic, he will review the defeat
 chachaa ne manaai thi mast holiapani seat jaswant nagar se record voton se jeetne waleshivpal yadavane kaaphi mjedaar andaaj main holi manaai thi, vah apane samarthakon ke saath jhum rahe the
 He stayed with his supporters during and after Holi, Shivpal also celebrated Holi in his native village Saifai
 aane vaale tufaan kii aahabhi tak to haar ke baad koi bayaanbaji nahin hui he
 But when the turn of the review comes, it is expected that once again the series of statements can start
 bihar main vidhansabha chunaav kii taarikh jaise-jaise najadik aa rahi he, janata parivaar main vilay ke baad kii ganth bhi ulajhati ja rahi he
 It is understood that all the six parties can agree on a flag and a symbol, but the screw is stuck on 'one leader'
 jabaki is bich nitish kumaar ne saaf taur par kaha he ki vilay ko lekar unke sur nahin badale hai
 In fact, all the confusion about the merger of Janata Parivar in Bihar is related to tug of war between RJD-JDUK
 sutron ke mutabik, vivaad janata parivaar ke 'ek netaa' ko lekar he
 RJD has refused to forward the name of Nitish Kumar
 lalu prasad kii is party main number- do maane jane vaale raghuvansh prasad singh ne bhi sidhe lafjon main kaha he kimukhyanmatrike naam par faisla chunaav ke baad jitkar aae vidhayakon ko karnaa chahie
 On the other side of the meeting in Delhi, in Patna, on the other hand, the Chief Minister of the state Nitish Kumar is not in the mood to give much weight to the matter at present
 yahi vajah he ki dilli main vilay kii baithak se nitish ne bhale hi kinar kar liya ho, lekinpatna main siemne kaha ki vilay par unke sur nahin badale hai
 Nitish said, 'there is no change in our stand on merger
 haalanki aisa kehete vakt nitish ke haav-bhav saaf bataa rahe the ki mahavilay kii dagar main sabakuch itnaa sidhaa bhi nahin he
 At the same time, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan reached Patna has pinched on the knot lying on the navalaya
 unhone kaha, 'ye bemail gathbandhan tha jo janata ke saamne aa gaya
 ' suraksha adhikariyon ke bich aaj aparaahn us samay afratfari much gai, jab ek vyakti ne unhen phone kar daawa kiya ki usne pradhanmantri narendra modi or dilli ke mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ke awaason par bam laga diya he
 This call later proved to be a rumor
 police ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha ki dopaher main kareeb saade 12 baje rashtriya jaanch agency (enie) ke niyantran kaksh main ek phone aayaa or agency ne turant isaki soochna police ko di
 Several teams with bomb dug squads were sent to the Prime Minister's 7, Race Course Road residence and Kejriwal's residence at Civil Lines
 unhone bataaya ki donon sthanon par gahan talaashi lee gai, lekin kuch nahin mila
 This call was rumored
 dilli police ke aatankwaad virdohi ikai ke vishesh prakoshth ko bhi isaki soochna di gai
 The official said the call was made through 'voice over Internet Protocol' (voip) and efforts are being made to locate the caller
 is silsile main ek maamla darj kiye jane kii bhi sambhaavna he
 The comments isi saptaah pehle bhi ek vyakti ne police niyantran kaksh ko phone kar raashtrapati bhawan tathaa madhya dilli main agyaat sthanon par bam rakhane kii dhamkee di

 Catering is the key reason behind such rising figures, catering and related health problems are being attributed

 Junk food catering is also becoming increasingly dominant in the lifestyle and it is leading to problems like obesity
 khanpan kii bigadati aadaten sharir ko kam umr main hi rogi bana rahi hai

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye congress ab tak ummidavaaron kii paanch list jari kar chuki he, lekin rajasthan ke ek bhi pratyaashee kaa naam ghoshit nahin ho paaya he
 For the last two weeks, meetings of state leaders have been going on, in which names have been decided on about fifty per cent of the total 25 seats, but there is still internal infighting on the candidates of the remaining seats
 mukhyamantri ashok gahalot or dipti siem sachin payalat ke guton kaa asar bhi tikat vitaran main deree kii vajah mana ja rahaa he
 High-profile seats like Ajmer, Jaipur and Barmer have more clashes
 dilli main teen dinon kii baithak ke baad congress main zyaadaatar siton par naam tay ho gaye hai, lekin ajmer, barmer-jaisalmer, jaipur or bhilwara jaisi ahm siton par ab bhi pench fansaa he
 Talking about Ajmer seat, the state health minister Raghu Sharma had won the by-election held here, now Sachin Pilot's camp is wishing that Raghu Sharma, who became special of Ashok Gehlot, should be given ticket from Ajmer seat once again
 jabaki raghu sharma loksabhaa chunaav ladanaa hi nahin chaah rahe hai
 They say that this seat has traditionally been the seat of Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, in which case they should decide their candidate
 isi tarah duusari siton par bhi centre or rajya kii raajnneeti ahm bindu ban gaya he
 Manvendra Singh, who left the BJP during the assembly elections, wants to contest from the barmer-jaisalmer Lok Sabha seat, but state revenue minister Harish Chaudhary is saying that he has to do politics at the Center
 haalanki, unke is tark ke peeche vajah kuch or bataai ja rahi he
 Sources say that Harish Chaudhary feels that despite being a senior leader, he has been given a ministerial position of less importance, in such a situation, instead of Ashok Gehlot or Sachin Pilot, he wants to do politics by staying in the team of Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 in siton par bhi takaravahrish choudhary hi nahin duusare netaa bhi jaipur se nikalakar dilli kii raajnneeti main aana chaahate hai
 CP Joshi, a strong leader close to Rahul Gandhi, has been marginalized after becoming the Speaker of the Assembly, in such a situation he also wants to contest the Lok Sabha elections and is once again contesting from Bhilwara seat
 isi tarah jaipur shahar kii seat ko lekar bhi ghamaasan he
 Mahesh Joshi, a Congress MLA from Jaipur city Lok Sabha seat and chief whip in the Vidhan Sabha, wants to contest
 mahesh joshi mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke khaas hai, lekin jis tarah sachin payalat or ashok gahalot gut main mantri pad bante usamen mahesh joshi khaali haath rah gaye
 Therefore they also want to do politics at the center instead of the state
 jabaki isi seat par congress kaa doosraa gut susheel sharma ke liye tikat maang rahaa he
 The mlas who do not get ministers are willing to contest the Lok Sabha elections, but the discussion is that in view of the stature of some current ministers, they should contest the Lok Sabha elections so that the BJP can be defeated
 aise halaat jaipur gramin loksabhaa seat par rahe hai, jahaan se krishi mantri lalchand kataaria ko kendriya mantri rajyavardhan singh rathore ke saamne utaarne par vichaar chal rahaa he
 However, Lalchand Kataria does not agree and wants his wife Rekha Kataria to be given a ticket
 tikat par takaraav sirf bade netaaon yaa mantriyon ko lekar hi nahin he, balki mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke parivaar par bhi pech fansaa he
 Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot wants to contest his son Vaibhav Gehlot from Jodhpur seat as well, while another faction of Congress wants to field a Jat or Vishnoi community candidate
 kul milakar rajasthan main yah siyaasi khinchataan darasal isliye ho rahi he kyonki ek khemaa duusare ko niptaana chahta he
 In such a situation, it is believed that only Congress President Rahul Gandhi will decide on these disputed seats, and after Holi, the list of Congress candidates will be released

 The editorial of the Sena mouthpiece Saamana wrote that a strategy is being chalked out for Delhi by calling Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee at the Sanghke program
 bijepi 2019 main hone vaale aam chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhkar agenda set kar rahi he
 The Shiv Sena estimates that if the BJP does not get an absolute majority in the 2019 general election, then this bet may work
 trishanku loksabhaa kii sthiti main narendra modi ke naam par agar sahyogi taiyaar nahin hue to phirapranab mukherjeeke naam ko aage kar diya jayega, or ye sabhi ke liye sarvamaanya ho sakate hai
 Responding to Sharmistha, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had also said the same in a conversation with ANI that we believe that the Sangh is already preparing for the 2019 situation, if BJP gets less than 110 seats, then Pranab Mukherjee Can be made the candidate for the post of Prime Minister

 cricket ke jaankaron kaa maananaa tha ki team india ke star of spinner ravichandran aswin bhartiya upmahadweep main jitne asardaar sabit hote hai, utane upmahadweep ke baahar nahin hote
 But this star Indian spinner proved all these claims wrong and showed that they are as dangerous in England as they are in the Indian subcontinent
 ravichandran aswin philhal england main wastershire ke liye county cricket khel rahe hai or unhone apane debyue match main hi 8 wicket lekar ye dikhaaya ki unki gendon main kitni dhar he
 Thanks to his brilliant performance, Worcestershire defeated Gloucestershire by 189 runs in a Division Two match
 srilanka ke khilaaf vanade siries main aaraam die jane ke baad aswin ne county cricket main khilne kaa faisla kiya
 On overseas pitches, Ashwin wants to improve his bowling, especially in England where he has played only 2 Test matches so far
 aswin ne pehle to number 6 par ballebaaji karte hue 36 ranon kii pari kheli
 After this, he showed his bowling style
 unhone pehali pari main 3 wicket jatke or duusari pari main 5 wicket chatkaaye
 Based on the first innings, Worcestershire gave Gloucestershire a target of 401 runs
 lakshya kaa peechha karte hue glustershire kii team 211 ran hi bana saki
 Ashwin troubled the Gloucestershire batsmen
 duusari pari main unhone 68 ran dekar 5 wicket chatkaaye
 This win will definitely boost Worcestershire's confidence after a disappointing performance in the natwest T20 Blast
 is samay toornament main wastershire kii team ne 11 main se 6 maichon main jeet hasil kii he or ank talika main wo duusare number par pahunch gaye hai
 He currently has 156 points
 ravichandran aswin jab apane debyue match main shandaar pradarshan ke baad dressing rum kii taraf laute to darshakon ne khadey hokar unka abhivadan kiya
 Apart from Ashwin, two more Indian players Cheteshwar Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja will also be seen playing county cricket soon

 The Delhi High Court maintains that keeping arms is not a fundamental right of anyone and nowadays, keeping weapons is mostly for 'appearance and dignity' rather than self-defense
 nyaayamurti sanjeev sachdev ne hathiyaar ke license hetu ek nijee company kaa aavedan radd karte hue ukt baat kahi
 The license authority and the Lieutenant Governor of Police have also rejected the request to license the company

 The court said that the Arms Act aims to ensure that citizens get weapons for self-defense, but this does not mean that all citizens should get a license to carry weapons
 adaalat ne kaha, kanoon kaa lakshya aatmaraksha he
 Licensing of arms is a prerogative given by law
 kisi vyakti ko hathiyaar rakhane kaa mul adhikaar nahin he
 He said, nowadays possessing weapons has become a matter of status
 zyaadaatar log hathiyaar sirf yah dikhaane ke liye chaahate hai ki ve, prabhaavshaalee vyakti hai
 Weapons are also being used for firing bullets on the occasion of happiness in marriages etc
 tippaniyan The petitioner had said that he trades two to three lakh rupees in cash every day and needs money and weapons for his protection
 adaalat ne aavedan ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki nakadi company kii amaanat he or yadi dhan ke suraksha kii jarurat he to, company jaruri kadam uthaaegi
 The court said, the petitioner has spoken of two-three lakh rupees cash per day
 sirf isliye kyonki ek vyakti din main do-teen lakh rupee nakad kaa kaarobaar karata he, or teesraa paksh bhi nahin kah rahaa he ki koi khatra he
 The Lieutenant Governor also said the same while canceling the license application

 The comments yachika daayar karne vaale ne kaha tha ki vah rojaanaa do-teen lakh rupee nakad kaa vyapaar karata he or use dhan tathaa apana suraksha ke liye hathiyaar kii jarurat he
 The court rejected the application, stating that cash is the security of the company and if there is a need to protect the money, the company will take necessary steps
 adaalat ne kaha, yachika daayar karne vaale ne pratidin do-teen lakh rupee nakad kii baat kahi he
 Just because a person trades two-three lakh rupees in cash a day, and the third party is not even saying that there is any danger
 uparajyapal ne bhi license kaa aavedan radd karte hue bhi yahi baat kahi thi
 The petitioner had said that he trades two to three lakh rupees in cash every day and needs money and weapons for his protection
 adaalat ne aavedan ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki nakadi company kii amaanat he or yadi dhan ke suraksha kii jarurat he to, company jaruri kadam uthaaegi
 The court said, the petitioner has spoken of two-three lakh rupees cash per day
 sirf isliye kyonki ek vyakti din main do-teen lakh rupee nakad kaa kaarobaar karata he, or teesraa paksh bhi nahin kah rahaa he ki koi khatra he
 The Lieutenant Governor also said the same while canceling the license application
 adaalat ne kaha, yachika daayar karne vaale ne pratidin do-teen lakh rupee nakad kii baat kahi he
 Just because a person trades two-three lakh rupees in cash a day, and the third party is not even saying that there is any danger

 '' pakistan se sachiv str kii baatcheet radd karne kaa faisla karke bharat ne pakistan ko bataa diya he ki dosti or dushmani saath-saath nahin chal sakate
 On one hand, Pakistan is extending the hand of friendship with India, on the other hand it is patting the back of Kashmiri separatists
 yah khulaa rahasy he ki pakistan na keval kashmiri algaavvaadiyon ko uksaata he balki vahaan aatankwaad ko badhaava bhi detaa he
 Everyday shelling from across the border is actually an attempt to get terrorists into India's border
 pakistan puri takat se yah prayaas karata rahata he ki kashmir kaa mudda sulagta rahe or iske liye vah dhan, hathiyaar vagairah algaavvaadiyon ko muhaiyaa karaata rahata he
 But despite this, India kept extending its hand of friendship towards him
 kaaran saaf tha ki aap apane padosi desh ke saath lambey arase tak shatrutapurna vyavhaar nahin rakh sakate hai
 Whether it is a case of Mumbai attacks or infiltration in Kashmir
 bharat ne hameshaa pakistan ko maaf kiya he or usase dosti banaae rakhane kii koshish kii he
 When Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, it was thought that he would take a strong stand against Pakistan, but he not only invited Pakistan's PM Nawaz Sharif in his swearing-in ceremony, but also gave him due respect
 aisa laga ki pakistan ke rukh main badlaav ho jayega
 But nothing like this happened
 iske peeche kai kaaran rahe
 Pakistan's problem is that despite having democracy there, the army keeps trying to run the government from behind
 pakistani fouj kaa rukh hameshaa bharat virdohi rahaa he
 Apart from this, there is also a section of ISI against India which continues to promote subversive actions here
 or in sabase badhkar islamic charampanthi gut hai jo bharat ko nishaanaa banane kii firaaq main rahete hai
 It is very difficult for the PM of Pakistan to ignore all these
 haalanki navaj sharif kii maansikta bharat virdohi nahin he, lekin unke salaahkaar or kai gut bharat virdohi ravaiya rakhte hai
 Nawaz Sharif had kept himself away from the Kashmiri separatists on his visit to India, but suddenly the High Commissioner there tried to test the patience of India by inviting the Kashmiri separatists to negotiate
 lekin is baar unhen ek dhakka laga he
 India has further closed the doors of dialogue with Pakistan
 yah ek sahi kadam he or isse pakistan ko nai sarkaar ke najariye kaa pataa chalegaa
 PM Modi had already expressed that he can give a tough answer to Pakistan if needed
 ab isaki shuruyaat ho chuki he
 India has shown tough attitude and has given the option of choosing one in friendship and enmity
 pakistan is samay araajaktaa ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 The democratic government is weak and the opposing parties are dominating
 fouj hameshaa kii tarah taak main khadi he ki kab takhta palat den
 The fundamentalists are trying to change the liberal mindset of a very large section of the population
 pakistan ke uttar main talibaniyon se fouj jujh rahi he
 Crime is at its peak
 kul milakar vah desh is samay jal rahaa he
 In such a situation, there is no one to talk to him
 is drushti se bhi yah kadam sahi he
 Those who know the nature of Narendra Modi also know how strict he is on certain subjects
 zaahir he nikat bhavishya main pakistan se baatcheet ke daravaaje nahin khulenge
 In the Unnao rape case, the Supreme Court has ordered completion of the trial in 45 days

 However, the victim's sister claimed that Akhilesh Yadav and his party had helped a lot
 peedita kii bahan ne bataaya ki abhi tak sarkaar kii taraf se unase milane koi nahin aayaa he
 He said that the cases against uncle are false

 He told that a month ago, the mla's men used to come and threaten them
 lekin jabase vidhayak jail main he tabhi se vidhayak nahin aayaa he
 The mla's men had threatened to withdraw the case or else kill the family

 In which the victim's mother and sister have cried their grief in front of the Women's Commission
 peedita kii maa or bahan ne bataaya ki kis tarah vidhayak or uske aadamiyon ne parivaar ko gaanv main peeta tha
 The victim's mother and sister had told that the mla's men followed the sister in the village

 In Bihar, two rebel leaders of BJP resigned from the assembly on the day JD (U) Netjitan Ram Manjhi became CM
 donon vidhayakon ne rajya main sattarudh janata dal (united) ke saath ekajutata dikhaai
 Resigning BJP mlas Vijay Mishra and Rana Gangeshwar Singh have been praising the incumbent Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for the past 11 months, against future Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 singh ne mangalvaar ko yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'hamane jad(you) or nitish kumaar ke saath ekajutata dikhaane ke liye istipha diya he
 Singh was suspended from the BJP in February for praising Nitish Kumar
 mishra ne bhi kai maukon par nirvatmaan mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii saraahna kii he
 Significantly, after the results of the Lok Sabha elections, the aggressive state BJP continued to claim that 50 JD (U) mlas were in touch with it and Nitish Kumar's government would collapse
 nitish kumaar ne loksabhaa chunaav main party ke kharaab pradarshan kii jimmevary lete hue apane pad se istipha de diya or 48 ghante baad jad(you) ne hi nae netaa jithan ram maanjhi ke netritv main sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya
 Two days ago, three rebel mlas of the Rashtriya Janata Dal Samrat Chaudhary, Javed Iqbal Ansari and Ram Lakhan Ram Raman also resigned from the assembly to join the JD (U)
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bijepi par aarope lagaaya ki jin rajyon main chunaav hone hote hai, vahaan vah dange karaati he
 He said that no such incident occurred in the national capital during the 15-year rule of the Congress Party
 silampur ilaake main ek chunavi raily main rahul gandhi ne purvi dilli ke trilokapuri ilaake main haal main hue dangon kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki prabhavit logon kii congress kaaryakartaaon ke alaava kisi anya party ke logon ne madad nahin kii
 He said, 'we were in power for 15 years in Delhi, but there was not a single incident of riots
 jahaan bhi chunaav hone hote hai, bijepi ke log danga bhadakaate hai
 Riots were instigated in Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Maharashtra, where elections were held
 ’dilli main congress ke satta main aane par sampradayik sauhaard behaal karne kaa vaada karte hue rahul gandhi ne kaha, ‘jab trilokapuri main dange hue, to aapane kejariwal yaa kisi or ko nahin dekha
 Congressmen helped the victims
 ’congress upaadhyaksh ne vibhinn samudaayon ke bich vibhaajan ke beej bone kaa prayaas karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 Rahul Gandhi said, 'BJP thinks that only 4-5 industrialists can dream in the country and for this they have a simple strategy to divide people
 ’unhone kaha, ‘garibon ko baanto, muslimon or hinduon ko baanto or unhen ladaao
 When people fight, when they are angry, they turn to it
 yah unki ranneeti he
 This is their strategy in every state
 ’unhone kaha, ‘aapako ek baat samajhane kii jarurat he
 Everyone here is like a family
 yahaan ham logon ke bich shatruta nahin he
 People here love each other and there is unity and harmony between them, but they are fought
 aisa isliye kiya ja rahaa he, taaki 4 se 5 udyogpatiyon ko sabhi tarah ke phaayde pahunchaae ja saken or garibon ko chhod diya jaae
 '--- from input language jahaan congress yaksha prashn ke saamne laachaar khadi he or sonia gandhi lagaataar hatotsahit hoti apni party ko dobaaraa koi disha dene ke liye uth khadi hui hai, aisa lagata he ki desh kii sabase puraani rajnatik party kii kismat hi daanv par lagi hui he
 a Congress leader in the Rajya Sabha said, "there is tremendous rhetoric because of confusion at the top
" "ise aasaan tareeke se yun samajhen ki sonia apni party kii kaman apane bete ko dene ko saharsha taiyaar hai lekin ve is baat ko lekar anishchit hai ki rahul un tamaam puraane congressiyon ko saath lekar chal paaenge yaa nahin jo kabhi unke pati rajeev ke kareebi dost or yahaan tak ki unki saas indira ke kareebi sahyogi hua karte the
 The old faces that Rahul wants to be removed include veterans like the organization's general secretary Janardan Dwivedi, treasurer Motilal Vora and Sonia's political secretary Ahmed Patel
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki rahul ne apni maa ko apni yah ichha jataa di he ki ve tab tak kaman apane haath main nahin lene vaale jab tak ve puri tarah use chhod nahin detii hai or unhen 129 saal puraane sanghathan ko dobaaraa nae sire se banane kii chhot nahin mil jaati
 In this drama between mother and son, it seems that the entire party is diving into the sky of mistrust
 band daravaajon ke peeche fusfusaahaten jari hai
 The old leaders are hopeful that this series will not make the party any more anxious, so that the BJP will benefit
 vaise bhi, sansad main 44 siton se or zyada bura kya ho saktaa he? sonia ab bhi is sawaal par lagaataar ulajh rahi hai
 It may take some more time to change the succession
 dilachasp yah he ki rahul kii namaujuudagi ke baavjood party ke pravaktaa or rahul ke kareebi sahyogi randeep surajevaala ne 24 march ko 67 pravaktaaon kii baari-bharkam suchi jari kar di jisase party kaaryakartaaon ke bich atakalein tej ho gayi ki rahul kii tajposhi kareeb he
 The question arises that if it does not, then why would Sonia Gandhi approve such a huge list which is one and a half times of her strength in the Lok Sabha? Except Priyanka Gandhi, who is an important advisor to her brother, many Congressmen said that It is feared that Rahul is surrounded by "all kinds of ngos" who do not give him very good advice
 '' mana jaataa he ki rahul ke apane ghere ke logon main party ke mahasachiv madhusudan mistre hai jinhone vadodara se narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav ladaa tha or apni jamaanat bhi ganvaa baithe the

 "A story about Mistry comes to be heard
 mistre loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan kareeb 300 tikaton ke bantwaare main kaaphi prabhaav rakhte the jinamein se sirf 23 logon ne apni seat par jeet hasil kii
 Apart from this, only 21 of the 205 former mps of the last Lok Sabha could save their seats who were given re-tickets
 mistre ne is bare main ek congressi ko kathith taur par bataaya tha ki ''rahul or unki team ko 2014 main hui haar kaa doshi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa kyonki donon samoohon main baraabar siton par vijay mili thi
 "rahul's worst critics ever believe that despite his temperamental nature," Rahul's intentions are fine and his outlook towards the Congress party is very clear
 "is dauraan kaha ja rahaa he ki sonia ne apane bete ko raji kar liya he ki ve congress kaarysmiti main chunaav karwaane par jor na den jo party kii sarvocch nirnayakari ikai he
 The fact behind this is the lesson of the disastrous results of the elections held last year in the Youth Congress and the Congress student organization NSUI
 loksabhaa main vipaksh ke ek saansad ne is baat kii ore ishaara kiya ki rahul agar kaman apane haath main le bhi lete hai to ''unhen modi ke yug main party kii vishistataa talashne main kaaphi sangharsh karnaa hoga
 He said that the way the regional parties have occupied the vacant space due to the defeat of the state-by-state Congress, they will no longer be willing to give the Congress space again
 vipaksh ke is saansad ne kaha, ''ek spasht or paribhaashit sandesh ke abhaav main rahul gandhi kii chhavi lagaataar uthle or sankalp rahit netaa kii bani rahegi
 It is enough to make them aware that they are being asked to hold the command of a drowning party
 jaahir he isse soshal media par jo latife gade jaaenge, unase unhen chot pahonchegi
 Despite this, a senior Congress leader expressed confidence that this was Rahul's last holiday
 sawaal uthta he agar aisa nahin hua to? agar ve phir gaayab ho gaye to? is sawaal par congressi netaa khad hue or unhone khaadi ke apane behad saaf-suthere kurte se kaalpanik dhul ko jhaad diya

 congress ne kaha he ki basapa ke chunaav chihn hathi ko dhankane ke congress ke nirnay se antat: bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ko hi phayda hoga kyonki agar inhen nahin dhanka jaataa to log basapa ke khilaaf badla lene kii bhaavana se vot karte
 The party also criticized Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati
 party ne unke is bayaan ke liye unki aalochana kii ki kanshiram kii ichha se ye murtiyon lagavai gai thim
 Party spokesman Rashid Alvi said, "this order will ultimately benefit the BSP as the people of Uttar Pradesh were upset with their statues and party icons in public places
" ve mayawati sarkaar ke khilaaf badale kii bhaavana se vot daalate
 Alvi said, "covering the party's emblem with her statues will reduce people's anger and she can avoid people's anger
" ’mayawati ne pehle kaha tha ki chunaav ayog ko congress ke chunaav chihn ‘haath’ or ralod ke ‘handpump’ ko bhi hathi kii pratimaaon kii tarah dhankna chahie
 He said in Lucknow, 'if the Election Commission does not take a decision regarding the election symbols of these two parties, then people will understand that this decision (regarding BSP) was taken from the anti-dalit and casteist mindset and under pressure from the Congress-led government at the Center Was taken ’ Union Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma has said that the Lok Sabha elections to be held in 2014 will be between Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 verma ne somvaar ko samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha, ‘vahaan (kendra main) yaa to congress kii sarkaar banegi, yaa phir modi kii
 Whom are you misleading
 kya janata itnaa bhi nahin samajhati
 'he said this in the context of SP Chief Mulayam Singh Yadav's claim that if the SP gets 60 seats in the Lok Sabha, then a third front government will be formed at the center
 verma ne kaha ki yadi congress party rahul gandhi ko pradhanmantri ke ummidavaar ke rap main pesh karti he to varsh 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav rahul banaam narendra modi hoga
 The Union Minister said, 'if Rahul Gandhi is our candidate in 2014, then that election will be Rahul vs Modi and the other parties will not survive anywhere
 ’kabhi sapa mukhiya mulaayam ke khasmkhas rahe verma ne daawa kiya ki keval congress party hi samaaj ke sabhi tabakon ke hiton kii chintaa karti he, chaahe vah musalmaan ho yaa hindu
 It is noteworthy that Verma had told reporters on the sidelines of a program that the ruling Akhilesh Yadav government in Uttar Pradesh was not able to function properly due to the intervention of SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav
 unhone mukhyamantri akhilesh ke bare main yah kehete hue koi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya tha ki ve unke bete jaise hai or unhen koi dosha nahin dena chaahate
 On the claim of SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav that if SP gets 60 seats in Lok Sabha, the next government will form the Third Front, Beni said that Mulayam is dreaming of becoming Prime Minister which is not going to be fulfilled

 The company has taken its booking only once, after which it was closed

 The customer has received a message which says, "thank you for your interest in jiophone
" uplabdh hone par ham aapako jaankaree denge-team jeeyo’
 a link is also given in this message which leads to the website
 company ke stand saaf he ki jiophone se gramin kshetron kaa torget kiya jayega yaa phir aise logon ko jo abhi bhi 3G yuj karte hai
 Therefore, the company has started delivery of jiophone from rural areas as well

 lekin iske takkar main airtel or vodaphone ne bhi 1,500 rupee kii effective keemat ke saath feechar phone nahin, balki smartfones launch karne shuru kar die hai
 So it is possible, this time there will be less booking for Jio phone than last time

 Pakistan has stopped the Samjhauta Express train on the outskirts on Thursday after the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 iske baad samjhauta express ataari wagha border se waapas laut ai
 Since then, questions have been arising in the minds of people, who will be the most hurt by Pakistan stopping the Samjhauta Express train, closing the airways and ending business relations
 is sambandh main samvidhan visheshgy dike dube kaa kahana he ki pakistan ne samjhauta express rokkar or kaarobaari rishton khatm karke bharat kaa kaam aasaan kar diya he
 If India had stopped the Samjhauta Express train and ended the business relationship, Pakistan could have gone to the international court on the matter
 isse seemaa paar se hone vaali taskari or aatanki ghuspaith rokane main bhi madad milegi
 Dubey says that Pakistan has become a pauper
 samjhauta express band hone se bharat kii karency pakistan ko nahin milegi, jiskaa khamiyaja use bhugatna padegaa
 As far as India is concerned, India is not dependent on Pakistan in any way
 iske saath hi pakistan ke is karname se bharat ko duniya ko yah bataane kaa mauka mil gaya he ki pakistan jis samjhaute ko karata he, wo usee kaa paalan nahin karata he
 Dubey says that Pakistan has violated the terms of the bilateral Shimla agreement reached in July 1972 by stopping the Samjhauta Express train
 antarrashtriya str par dwipaksheeya samjhaute sabase zyada ahm maane jate hai
 Under the Simla Agreement, Samjhauta Express train was introduced to increase contacts and strengthen relations between the people of the two countries
 lihaaja isko friendship express ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 According to constitution expert Dubey, India and Pakistan signed the Simla Agreement in July 1972 to maintain peace and improve mutual relations after the 1971 war
 is samjhaute par bharat kii pradhanmantri indira gandhi or pakistan ke raashtrapati julfikar ali bhutto ne dastakhat kiye the
 In this, the two countries agreed to settle the mutual dispute and establish contact between the people by land, air and sea route
 aapako bataa den ki samjhauta express train 43 saal pehle 22 july 1976 ko pehali baar ravaanaa hui thi
 Initially it used to run daily from Amritsar in India to Lahore in Pakistan, but in 1994 it was decided to run this train two days a week on Tuesday and Thursday
 iske saath hi samjhauta express train ko dilli se lahore tak chalaaya jane laga
 What is the Samjhauta Express Train India and Pakistan agreed under the Simla Agreement that they would respect each other's sovereignty
 kisi ke aantarik maamle main dakhal nahin denge
 Dubey says that Pakistan is interfering in India's internal affairs regarding Kashmir, which is against the Simla Agreement
 presidential order ke baad kashmir bharat kaa abhinn hissaa ban chukaa he
 So now no country can interfere on this issue
 agar pakistan dakhal detaa he, to yah antarrashtriya kanoonon kaa bhi ulanghan he
 The Simla Agreement also mentioned that the two countries would not spread propaganda against each other
 shimla samjhaute ke tahat donon desh aapasi vivaad ko shantipurna tareeke se sulajhane ke liye bhi sahamat hue
 The agreement emphasized that the two countries would take steps to strengthen the relationship to increase contact between the common people
 isamen sauhardpurn rishte banane ko lekar bhi qaraar kiya gaya
 Apart from this, both countries will also take steps to increase business
 saath hi vigyaan or samskruti ke kshetra main aapasi aadan-pradaan badhaane ko lekar bhi samjhauta kiya gaya
 These days, star kids are rocking Bollywood

 a post shared by Neil Nitin Mukesh (@neilnitinmukesh) on Dec 9, 2019 at 9:31 am PST Tell us Neil Nitin Mukesh (neil Nitin Mukesh) was married to Rukmini Sahay (rukmini Sahay) in 2017
 unhone film industry main apana debyue 2007 main shriram raghavan kii film 'johny gaddaar' (johnny Gaddaar) se kiya tha
 His performance in this film was highly praised
 haal hi main nil nitin mukesh south ke superstar prabhas (prabhas) ke saath film 'saaho' (saaho) main najar aae
 The film has received a tremendous response from fans
 bainkon or atm ke baahar aajkal bharat ke andar ek or bharat khadaa najar aata he
 It seems as if everyone is standing in the queue
 qatari main khadaa he is intjaar main ki nae note darshan den
 Those new notes, which are being made all claims and promises of not being copied
 magar kamaal dekhie abhi thik se maheenaa bhi puraa nahin hua he
 The color of the pink notes was not completely relaxed to the eyes yet
 log is nai-naveli do hazari ko haathon main lene ko abhi taras hi rahe hai
 Even before that her soutan came in the market
 ji haa
 Fake notes have already arrived in the market since the new genuine notes of 2000
 lihaaza mauka aapke hoshiyaar rahane kaa he
 At around half past eight on the night of November 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi suddenly gives a message to the nation and announces the closure of 500 and thousand notes
 udhar wo elaan karte hai idhar agle ghante se hi desh qatari main khadaa ho jaataa he
 Then, with each passing day, the note captivity is told and the specialty of the new notes
 kaha jaataa he ki nae noton kaa nakal ab aasaan nahin hoga
 Since Prime Minister No himself asked for an extension of fifty days, the whole country is still standing in line with patience
 takalif ke in palon ko bas isliye bhula kar ki chalo kuch achh ke liye ho rahaa he
 Black money and fake notes will be eliminated from the country
 lekin pradhanmantri ke maange pachaas din chhodie abhi notebandi ko maheenaa bhi puraa nahin hua
 Even people have not yet been able to see the new note properly and fake note again came in the market
 desh main dhadadhad nakli noton kii khep pakadi ja rahi he
 The question is, how did everything become fake so soon? How the government's decision of demonetisation became a junk? And how fake currency worth two thousand rupees was printed at home? So before we tell you the answers to all these questions, let us first match you with these faces who sabotage the campaign of demonetisation
 naam- abhinav vermapahchaan- mastermindpadhai- beatech studentnaam- vishakha vermapahchaan- abhinav kii kajanpadhai- emb studentnaam- suman nagpalpahchaan- property dealrayhi wo teen log hai jinhen mohali police ne tab dhar dabocha, jab wo ek laal batti lagi audi car main 42 lakh rupye ke nakli note lekar ja rahe the
 Fake notes of two thousand rupees and all of them of the same number
 ek to audi kyuu seven jaisi mahangi or aaleeshaan car, upar se us par lagi laal batti
 Generally, the police also refrain from checking such VVIP vehicles and interrogating the people sitting in them, but the case here was a little different
 mohali police ko is lalabatti lagi car main jaali noton kii khep kii pukhta khabar mili thi
 Later, during interrogation, these three not only confessed to the counterfeiting of these notes, but also said that they have been printed in the market by printing fake notes worth Rs
 3 crores so far
 jaali noton ke in saudagaron ne mana ki wo is vakt bhi 42 lakh rupee ke ye nakli noton kii khep kahin deliver karne ke iraade se ghar se nikle the
 Now the question was, after all, how did these three print such fake notes so easily and so quickly? And how did this entire channel to get fake notes marketed? This Abhinav Verma, the mastermind of this gang, is the same guy who was chosen by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the Make in India award
 par isane apana hunar kahaan or kaise istemaal kiya ab ye jaan lijie
 Before the Modi government's decision on demonetisation, he was identified as a flamboyant and capable boy
 magar notebandi ke baad do hajaar kaa nayaa note dekhte hi uske puraane khyaal badal gaye
 Sudden greed tempted him
 bas isi ke baad usne apana kaabil dimag nakli note chhapane ke tareeke par lagaana shuru kar diya
 a pair of siblings who complete professional courses like btech and MBA will be caught with a large consignment of counterfeit notes, strange indeed
 lekin idhar sarkaar ne notebandi kaa elaan kiya or udhar abhinav or vishakha ne notebandi ke is maukey kaa phayda uthaa kar nakli note chhapana shuru kar diya
 Both of them have a good family background, due to their being well educated, their minds also used to run fast
 itnaa tej kii abhinav ne netraheenon ke liye ek aisi divaiz bana di, jisaki badaulat netraheen bagaiyr stick ke chal sakate hai
 Due to this invention of Abhinav, he was also selected for the Make in India award
 lekin kehete hai naa ki jab padhaa likhaa insaan gunaah ke raste par chalata he, to kuch zyaada hi bada gunahagaar banataa he
 This was something similar with this pair of siblings
 haalanki donon ne nakli note chhapane ke liye scanning or color priting kaa purana tareeqa hi chunaa tha, magar is kaam main har baariki kaa unhone khyaal rakhaa
 Be it paper, color or printing quality
 sabase pehle ye do hajaar ke nae note ko scan karte
 After that, he would take out his color print on the paper of the same size
 technikali sound hone kii vajah se note scan kar unka print nikaalane ke dauraan bhi ye uski quality mentin karne kaa tareeqa sikh chuke the
 Then, since only two thousand rupee notes are in the market, due to this, people are not as well aware of the features and paper quality of these notes
 aise main bhai bahan kii is jodi ke liye in noton ko market main khapaana bhi aasaan ho gaya
 With the help of middlemen, such people were caught who were trying to change the old currency to the new currency
 pulicene jab inhen 42 lakh rupye kii nakli karansi ke saath pakadaa, to inke paas se 2-2 hazaar rupye ke note kii shakl main kul 42 lakh rupee mili
 Amazing it was all the notes of the same number
 kyonki ek hinote ko scankar unhone uske hajaaron print nikaal die
 According to the police, in this way, both of them were not only acquiring old real currency in exchange for fake currency, they were also engaged in spending them in different places
 isi silsile main unhone ye second hand audi kyuu seven car bhi kareed lee thi
 But it was this car that got him caught
 pakistan ne bhartiya nausena ke purv adhikari kulbhushan jadhav ko ro ke agent hone ke shaq main maut kii sajaa sunai he, jisase donon deshon ke bich tanatani bad gai he
 On the other hand, the Indian Coast Guard, by setting the example of humanity, saved 2 commandos of the Pakistani Maritime Security Agency from drowning in the deep sea
 ravivaar ko pakistani meritime security kii hai speed boat rasta bhatak gai thi
 There were 6 Marine commandos in this boat
 aise main pakistani agency ne bhartiya coast guard se madad maangi
 The Coast Guard immediately conducted a rescue operation in Okha area of gujarat with the help of its ship and helicopter
 darasal pakistani meritime security kii boat main kharabi aane kii vajah se wo gahari samandar main funs gai
 During this time Indian fishermen also helped them a lot
 puure din or raat bhar chale is oparation main bhartiya coast guard, pakistani meritime security agency ke 2 commando ko bachaane main kaamyaab rahe
 The health of one of these commandos was severely impaired, which immediately provided medical help
 haalanki 4 anya pakistani commando ko nahin bachaaya ja sakaa
 The Pakistani Maritime Security Agency later discovered four bodies
 bhartiya costguard kii is madad ke liye pakistani meritime security ke diji ne phone karke shukriya adaa kiya he

 vishwa hindu parishad ke varisht netaa ashok singhl 84 kosi yatra na nikaalane dene par upi sarkaar se khafa hai to unhone ek baar phir narendra modi main unki pragadh aasthaa jataai he
 They see Narendra Modi as an institution
 or unka vishwaas he ki narendra modi unka saath denge
 In conversation with Rahul Kanwal in Aaj Tak program 'sidhi Baat', Ashok Singhal spoke openly
 padhein:mulamay or sonia gandhi ko lagegaa shramshok singhl kaa kahana he ki sant bijepi ke saath hai
 And they are trying to get BJP 300 seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 centre main bijepi kii sarkaar bani to ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan jarur hoga
 Singhal also said that Praveen Togadia did wrong by opposing Narendra Modi
 kya modi ko phayda pahunchane ke liye aap yatra kar rahe the?is sawaal par ashok singhl ne kaha- 'santon kaa vishwaas raajnneetik dal main nahin he
 They prepare Rambhaktas
 congress ke charitra main giravat ai he
 Saints are with BJP
 sant bhi narendra modi kaa naam le rahe hai
 Modi is also a product of Ram Janmabhoomi movement
 sant unke liye kaam kar rahe hai, ye kahana to santon ko bahut chota kar dena he
 The issue of Ram Janmabhoomi is our cultural issue
 hamaare desh kaa dharmik mudda he
 Amit Shah sent by Modi has clearly stated that Ram temple will be built
 lekin narendra modi to mandir ke mudde par khamosh hai?is sawaal ke jawaab main ashok singhl ne kaha- 'akele modi or bijepi se nahin hoga
 i believe that when 300 people reach the Parliament through Ramabhaktas, then the temple will be constructed at Ram Janmabhoomi
 sant bhi maanate hai ki akele bijepi ye kaam nahin kar paaegi
 The saints are working to make Rambhaktas
 ham bhi yahi kah rahe hai or sant isiilie kaarykram chalaae hue hai, lekin ye raajnneetik nahin he

 uble andey kaa safed hissaa protein hota he, jiske bare main ab tak yahi mana jaataa tha ki use uski pehali sthiti main nahin laayaa ja saktaa lekin ab vaigyanikon ne uble andey ko pehali avasthaa main laane ke liye protein ko alag-alag karne kaa tarika dhund nikaala he
 It used urea to break the boiled eggs and then a high-capacity machine called 'vortex Fluid'
 iske baad protein apni pehali avasthaa main aa gai
 This process can lead to radical changes by using the isolated proteins because this protein can create an anti-body for a serious disease like cancer, which will be extremely cheap

 5 Star 'rebelious Flower' is a film based on 'osho Rajneesh', if you think this film speaks of the Osho Rajneesh who was known for sex, power struggle and controversies, then you are wrong
 yah film, osho kii baalyavastha kii kahani he
 Osho was known for his principles to the country and abroad in the 70s and 80s, US President Ronald Reagan declared 'osho' to be a 'traitor' at that time because Osho's followers took a barren land of America ' Rajneeshpuram '
 osho ke folovers kii takat sirf desh main hi nahin, balki videshon tak bahut zyada hua karti thi
 But 'rebelious Flower' is not the story of Osho who wrote a book like 'from Samband to Samadhi'
 'rebelius flower' mumbai ke sameep 'pune' main sthit osho sanyasi doctor swami jagadish bharti kii dekh rekh main banaai gayi he, osho kii gaiyr aadhikarik biography ko screenple main bakhubi utaarne kaa kaam jagadish bharti ne kiya he
 Although the director of the film is Krishan Hooda, who is not an Osho follower, but he has made the film come alive in view of Osho's childhood
 'rebelius flower' kahani he us osho kii jisane apane 'baalyavastha' main aise sawaal puche, jiskaa jawaab kaaphi mushkil hua karata tha
 Osho asked many questions related to the preacher of Nedharma, to which no one had any answer
 film main child actor prince shah bachapan ke osho ke kirdaar main hai vahiin shashaank shekhar ne kishoravastha ke osho kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 In Osho's life, three babas (magga Baba, Paggal Baba and Masto Baba) had an important role, played by actor Mantra
 film ko desh videsh main kai film samarohon main dikhaaya ja chukaa he, to agar aapako aadhyatm main yakeen he, ek saaf suthri or chote balak ke sawaalon par aadhaarit film dekhnaa chaahate hai or osho kii jindagi se judi kai ankahi baton ke bare main jaanane kii ichha rakhte hai to aap yah film dekh sakate hai

 isamen ladkaa baar-baar poochta he, sande kab he
 We are all like this too
 chuttee ke intjaar main
 We work all week long just because we have to work
 kya or koi vajah he hamaare paas, shaayad nahin
 No thrills, no excitement, no joy
 naukari he, isliye kaam karnaa he or kya
 This is the reason that on Friday, we feel exhausted
 or veekend, vah to hamen abe-zam zam sa lagata he
 Full of relief
 magar phir aata he, somvaar
 Who looks like a villain
 jo chalaa aata he aapako pareshaan karne ke liye
 To make you grind again in the same mill of work and fatigue
 somvaar hafte kaa or aapke shaareerik-maansik 'daman-chakra' kaa pehla din
 But, what is so bad is this day or something, the reality behind it
 kya hamaari soch nahin iske peeche kii jimmedaar
 Buddha says we become what we think
 yani hamen soch par padaa pardaa hataane kii jarurat he
 It helps to remove this curtain - 'love your Monday and retire young'
 'kaam kaa junun nahin, junun hi kaam'lav yor mande and ritair yang' naukari ko mahaj naukari samajhane se inkaar karti he
 It tells passion to make work, not work burden
 kitaab hamase sawaal puuchhati he
 It asks if we are really satisfied with the work we are doing
 kya vaaki ham vahi kar rahe hai, jo ham karnaa chaahate hai
 And even bigger question, do we really know what we want
 ham sabamein na jane kitne log jindagibhar apni is chahat se anjaan rahete hai
 Life changes at any point
 Sometimes, we suddenly meet someone who changes our outlook for life
 kitaab ke lekhak siddharth sharma kii mulaakaat 80 varsh paar kar chuke ek bujurg se hoti he
 After meeting him, he realizes his incompleteness
 vah shaks bataata he ki vah shikshak bananaa chahta tha, lekin banker ban gaya
 Perhaps he did not realize it at that age
 tabhi siddharth ko lagata he ki vah bhi lekhak banakar zyada santusht rah sakate the
 It is at this point that their thinking and approach to life changes
 vah apni jami-jamaai naukari chhodkar lekhan ke kshetra main aa jate hai
 'dil Ki Awaaz Bhi Suna' 'love Your Mondays and Retire Young' inspires you to take a new approach to personal and professional life
 siddharth bataate hai ki apane junun ko hasil karne ke liye aapako kis tarah kii ranneeti apnaani chahie
 In this book, he gives 12 sources for leading a professional business life
 yah kitaab jindagi jeene kaa aapkaa tarika badal sakati he
 Siddhartha not only advises to live by listening to his heart, he also does so
 ve apni naukari chhodte hai or apane dil kii aawaaj sunate hai
 The writing of freshness is freshness in the writing of Siddharth
 vah yuvaaon kii bhashaa main baat karte hai
 The book itself is written in a conversational manner
 lekin, kahin bhi yah saamaanya aatmakathaatmak andaaj si bojhil nahin hoti
 Reading the book, you will realize that there is no need to struggle much for happiness and satisfaction
 yah to aapke bheetar hi chuphi ek cheez he
 You need to explore within yourself
 khushi ke liye aapako apane dil ke bataae raste par chalanaa chaiye
 It is not so difficult as we think
 bas hamen us aawaaj ko sunne kii jarurat he, jo rosemara ke shor-sharabe main kahin dabakar rah jaati he
 Gradually rising, it is said that to take the juice of food, it should be eaten slowly
 yahi baat is kitaab par bhi lagu hoti he
 Read it slowly, it will go down in you and maybe only then it will become an inspiration for you
 kitaab sirf yuvaaon kaa hi nahi, unke abhibhavakon kaa bhi maargdarshan karti he
 This book tells you that there is no use to run unconscious in this race
 kamyaabi ke liye andaaj alag hona chahie

 ye naa to big bos kaa ghar he or naa hi ye sab big bos ke mehmaan
 This is a common family in Delhi, but separated from Delhi
 kyonki dilli kaa ye parivaar pichley paanch saalon se apane hi ghar main kaid he
 Although the people of this house, like the rest of Delhi, wake up in the morning, they are ready, but instead of going out to work, all of them just stay locked in this room
 khauf aisa ki ghar main koi ek-do nahin, balki 16 sisitivi camere laga rakhe hai
 Who record all the activities happening here round the clock
 ghar ke raste main, main get par, baraamde main or yahaan tak ki living room main bhi ye camere har vakt chaalu rahete hai
 That is, every movement inside the house is captured in the camera every moment
 alam ye he ki ghar ke baahar kab subah hoti he or kab shaam dhalati he
 They do not even know
 or to or is ghar ke bacchon ne bhi isi khoff ke chalate skool tak janaa chhod diya he
 The younger daughter also goes to school occasionally, but the elder daughter has not seen the school for the last three years
 parv-tyohaar ke maukey par dost-rishtedaar jarur aa jate hai, badhaaiyaan dekar chale jate hai lekin is parivaar ke log kisi ke ghar nahin ja sakate
 Now the question is, what is the fear, who has kept this family in his own house for the last five years
 kyon ye parivaar ghar se bahar nahin nikalataa
 Why the children of this family do not go to school
 kyon parivaar ke bade kaam par baahar nahin nikalate
 Why are these families forced to live under the shadow of 16 CCTV cameras inside the house
 cabel oparator kaa kaam karanevaale bijender singh or unke parivaar kii jindagi pehle aisi nahin thi balki ab se paanch saal pehle unka parivaar bhi ek aam or khushhaal jindagi ji rahaa tha
 The people of the house lived together, used to go around, the girls went to school, but on 12 November 2004, there was an incident with Bijender that changed not only Bijender, but his family
 is rose badmaashon ke ek gang ne bijender kii jaan lene ke liye unke daftar par dhaava bolaa
 Luckily Bijender was not there then, which saved his life, but on the go, the miscreants shot dead one of Bijender's attendants
 ye hamalaa ilaake ke shaatir badmaash chandra prakaash urf chandu ne kiya tha
 Actually, this attack on Bijender's shop was the result of denial of extortion
 bijender ke cabel kaa kaarobaar un dinon shabaab par tha or unki isi tarakkee ko badmaashon kii najar lag gai
 Now Bijender started the fight to get justice for his family members
 police ne kaatilon ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kar maamle kii tafteesh shuru kii or bijender ne tamaam dhamkiyon kii andekhi karte hue chandra prakaash urf chandu ke khilaaf court main gavaahi di
 This testimony of Bijender on the test of justice proved to be the last nail in Chandu's coffin and he was punished
 pehle unhen seshan court main jeet mili or phir hai court main
 Now Bijender breathed peace
 unhen do baton kaa sukun tha
 The first is that he hardly got right, but has succeeded in getting justice for his Maktool Mulajim and secondly that after the conviction of Gunaghar Chandu, he has no fear of Chandu in the coming days
 kuch saalon tak bijender kii ye soch sahi sabit hui lekin iske baad takreeban do saal baad phir ek aisi baat hui, jisane bijender ke pairon tale jameen khiskaa di
 Suddenly a call came from an unknown number on his mobile
 idhar, bijender ne phone uthaaya or udhar se duusari taraf chandu kii aawaaj gunji
 But then how was it possible
 kyonki seshan court ke baad hai court ne bhi chandu kii apil khaarij kar di thi or use aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 He was in jail
 mobile par sunai padi chandu kii aawaaj ne bijender ko chaunkaa diya
 He could not understand how Chandu could call him like this, because he was in jail and he had to stay in jail for ten days, not a week, because he was sentenced to life imprisonment
 pehle to bijender ne ise kisi kii sharaarat samaj kar bhuulane kii koshish kii
 But after a few days, when he got a call from another number on his mobile again, he got confused, because this time there was the same voice on the other side
 phone karanevaale ne khud ko chandu bataaya or kaha ki usne use beshak salaakhon ke peeche pahunchaa diya ho, lekin agar jeena he to ab wo uski maang puri karne ko taiyaar ho jaae
 The caller was asking for 2
5 lakh rupees this time
 duusare phone kol ke baad bijender ke liye ab ise halke main lene kii koi vajah nahin bachi, kyonki is baar phone karanevaale uski baat nahin maanane par use naa sirf jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di, balki ye bhi kaha ki wo unki betiyon ko bhi nahin chhodega
 After this, several phones were received on Bijender's mobile one after the other
 ab pareshaan bijender ne police ke daravaaje par pahunchaa lekin pehle to police ne use chalata karne kii koshish kii, magar baad main adaalat ke kehane par usne is maamle main exiaar darj kar lee
 When police took those numbers on surveillance in connection with Taftish, it was found that all the numbers were active not only in the Tihar Jail area, but from these numbers, Bijender's mobile was also called
 lekin ajeeb baat ye thi ki is chaunkaanewaale sach ke saamne aane ke baad bhi police kii kaan main jun nahin reng rahi thi
 On the other hand, Bijender's hands and feet began to swell, because he began to feel that the person who can sit in jail and call from many different numbers, he can also be harmed by sitting in jail
 And in the meantime, Chandu did the work to prove his words right, which Bijender had not even thought about
 raat ke andhere main gali main maujuud bikeron kii ye bheed mahaj ittefaq nahin he balki bikeron kaa ye gang chandu kii un dhamkiyon kaa practical he,jo wo lagaataar jail main baithe-baithe bijender ko detaa rahaa he
 In the CCTV footage, a gang of bikers stops at Sangam Vihar at the exact place where Bijender's house is located
 inamen har bike par do se teen log baithe hai, jo kisi ko dhundhate hue nazar aate hai
 Actually, these were the henchmen of Chandu, who arrived here in search of Bijender
 pehle to inamen se ek biker bijender ke ghar ja kar unke bare main pataa karata he or jab gharavaale bijender ke vahaan nahin hone kii baat kehete hai, to bikeron kaa gang unke daftar ke liye ravaanaa ho jaataa he lekin isi bich sisitivi camere man wo tasviir kaid hoti he, jise dekh kar koi bhi hairaan rah jayega
 See how the crooks who know Bijender are openly looking for him while waving arms
 sisitivi main apni harkaton ke kaid hone se bekhbar ye badmaash jab bijender kii talash main pahunche the, to unhone baqayada apane saath hathiyaar le rakhe the
 Luckily Bijendar did not meet him that day, but this act of miscreants got captured in CCTV
 haalanki itnaa hone ke baavjood police ne bijender ko mil rahi chandu kii dhamkiyon ko gambhirtha se nahin liya
 On the other hand, gradually Bijender and his whole family started living in the shadow of fear
 betiyon ko mil rahi dhamkiyon kii vajah se unhone apni badi beti ke skool jane par bhi roak laga di or ghar main hi tution lagava kar use padhaane lage
 For his protection, he had to deploy a private security guard, or PSO, who still stays with him like a shadow at all times and till now the High Court, sensing the exaggeration of the case, provided 24 hours security to the Delhi Police
 Has ordered to be held
 itnaa hone ke baavjood police kii tafteesh main ab tak aisa kuch bhi nahin hua, jisase chandu kaa hausala toote or bijender or unka parivaar duusare tamaam logon kii tarah ek aam jindagi ji sake

 Asus has recently launched some selfie smartphones of India Zenfone 4 series
 hamane inamen se ek Zenfone 4 Selfie Dual Camera smartphone kaa rivyuu kiya he
 Read the review and read for yourself how this smartphone will be for you
 dizin or bild qualityasoos ke lagbhag sabhi smartfones main kuch chijen ek jaisi hoti hai
 Not much company changes the design segment
 yah ek bajet smartphone he or is lihaaj se isaki bild quality acchhee he
 It has a metal body and curved glass makes it easy to use
 yah smartphone patala he or kaaphi halkaa he, itnaa halkaa kii aapako yah dami set jaisaa lag saktaa he
 Lighter means its weight is less than other smartphones in this segment
 fingerprint scinar smartphone ke front ke home batan main diya gaya he
 The rear camera is in the center at the top
 phone kii dayee taraf wolum rocker kii or power batan he jabaki baayin taraf aapako sim trey milegaa
 The bottom has an audio jack and a jack for charging
 dizin or bild quality awwal darje kii nahin he, lekin thik thaak he or yuj karnaa aasaan he
 Like the name of this smartphone of performance and it is marketed, in that sense it is made for selfie only
 lekin parformens kii baat karen to segment ke lihaaj se fast he or lag nahin karata he
 This smartphone has a 430 processor of Qualcomm Snapdragon with 4GB of RAM
 is bajet main isse behatar procesar lagaaya ja saktaa tha, kyonki is bajet main duusari companiyaan isse behatar procesar de rahi hai
 It has Adreno 505 GPU for graphics and is good for gaming
 hamane is smartphone Asphalt 8 jaise heavi graphics ke game khele hai, lekin ek samasya hame ai he
 It gets hot every time you play games with heavy graphics
 isliye ye aam yuj ke liye to thik he, lekin power yugers ko isamen dikkaton kaa saamana kar pad saktaa he
 Moving from one app to another is easy and loading time is short, but sometimes there is a problem
 haalanki loding time kam hone kii vajah se aap ise notice nahin kar paaenge jo acchhee baat he
 Camera: Now let's talk about the camera, which is the biggest feature of this smartphone
 isamen 20 megapixl kaa front camera diya gaya he
 This dual camera is awesome and clicks a good photo
 do camaron ko aam taur par dapth effect ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he or isamen diya gaya dual camera isamen master he or yah kaam badhiya karata he
 Better selfie clicks can also be done in low light
 selfi camere ke duusari sabase badi khaasiyat yah he ki isamen ek 120 degree wide angel lens lagaaya gaya he
 That is, if a group has to take a group of Cesfi, then this smartphone is tremendous in it
 group selfi ke alaava aas paas ke object bhi capchar hote hai
 This feature is amazing and it is awesome for selfie or groupfi
 selfi ke liye flash bhi he jo behatar he
 Overall, after this smartphone, it is clear that the monopoly of OPO and Vivo is not going to happen in Selfie and Gruffy and now Asus has also launched the best selfie smartphone recognizing the pulse of selfie lovers
 displeis smartphone main 5
 a 5-inch HD display is provided which is LCD
 disple brit he or colors achche dikhte hai
 However, if the company had a full HD display in this segment, it would have been better and you will definitely miss this deficiency
 rejulushan thod den to isaki disple prabhavit jarur karti he
 Pixel density is low and there is a lack of sharpness, so therefore the display is also not topper, according to this price segment
 agar aap dhoop main yuj kar rahe hai suraj kii raushnee he yaa darect sanlite he to aapako thodi pareshaani jarur hogi
 Battery, fingerprint scanner and software Zenfone 4 Selfie has a 3,000mah battery
 rivyuu ke dauraan maine paaya ki isaki bydaree jitani jaldi charge hoti he utani hi jaldi dren bhi
 That is, you charge it full in an hour and be very alert to run this phone throughout the day
 kyonki mixd yuj main iskaa byaap 12 ghante se kam he, haalanki aam yuj par yah 12 ghante kaa byaap degi
 Overall, the battery department of this smartphone has also disappointed us
 softwarelanovo ne apane baari bharkam yujar interphes se yugers ko aazaadee de di he
 That is, the company has now understood that its custom user interface is a burden for the customers
 aisa hi shaomi ne MI A1 ke saath kiya he
 It also has Pure Android One
 lekin asoos ko yah samaj nahin aayaa he shaayad, isliye company abhi bhi apane khaas yujar interphes yani skin detii he jo kai logon ko pasand bhi nahin aata
 However, the Android n based company has its own skin in it
 isamen kai kaam ke fitures bhi hai jo aapako pasand aaegein
 It has zenui 4 and many tweaks
 kya aapako yah smartphone lenaa chahie?kya aap selfi ke shaukeen hai? group selfi lene kii jarurat padati he? agar haa, to bilkul ye aapke liye behatar smartphone hoga is segment main
 But if you are a power user and you need good software and display then this smartphone will disappoint
 company isamen behatar procesar yuj karke ise na sirf selfi, balki parformens smartphone banaaya ja saktaa he

 unka aakhri post 29 may kaa he jo gaiyr raajnneetik he
 Until then, nothing has been posted until the news is written
 ye eklauta maamla nahin he
 Many more Facebook pages which were known for opposing Modi are all being deleted from their old posts
 “viral in india”, “ji news ko band karo”, “prasoon vaajapei phans” or “ai saport raveesh kumaar” jaise kuch pej hai jo yaa to delit kar diye gaye yaa unhone apane raajnneetik post hataa diye hai
 These Facebook pages usually had 3 lakh to 20 lakh followers
 chunaav ke dauraan in pejon par khub prachaar hota tha kai baar ye juthi khabaren failaane se bhi nahin chookte the
 Fact checkers have exposed them many times but at the moment those posts have disappeared
 fasebuk pej “ viral in india” kii ek website “viralindia
 net ”which was also closed after the defeat of Congress
 us website kii kuch kahaniyon koyahanpadha ja saktaa he
 Two more anti-modi pages, Punya Prasun Vajpayee Fans and i Support Ravish Kumar have also gone silent
 donon ne apane post delit kar diye hai
 According to crowdangal Analysis, both of them have deleted the posts of last one year
 haalanki pichley dinon madhya pradesh main congress kii kamalnath sarkaar ke samarthan main do ek post zarur kiye gaye haisaint bhala to sab bhaladusri taraf bijepi ke samarthak pejon par dhandha badastoor jari he
 However, activities on pages like "NAMO" have reduced
 chunaav ke aakhri daur main 18 may ko is pej par kareeb 4 lakh logon ne samvaad kiya , aam dinon main ye sankhya 78 hajaar thi
 Similarly, on the day of results, this number was around one and a half lakh
 baad main is sankhya main kaaphi giravat ai
 Most of the bjp-backed pages like "modinama" and "I Support Narendra Modi" are either engaged in protests against Rahul Gandhi and Mamata, or are busy highlighting the achievements of the Modi government
 modi kii shandaar jeet ke baad farji khabaron or jhuthe prachaar main kaaphi kami ai he
 On the pro-government pages, stories featuring the praise of new ministers are being shared
 lekin aisa nahin he ki saare modi virodh chup ho gaye hai
 Many are still in the fray, such as "I Support Abhisar Sharma" and "fekuexpress" are constantly engulfing the government
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav maidan ke saath saath soshal media par bhi jamkar ladaa gaya
 Apparently, the results had to be impacted on social media users too
 lekin itnaa tay he ki ye ek fori parivartan he or aane vaale dinon main ek baar phir soshal media par tagdi ladaai dekhne ko milegi

 In the midst of the farmers 'agitation in various parts of the country over various demands from the government, a farmers' organization associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has blamed the Centre's policies for the crisis and termed it unreasonable
 bhartiya kisaan sangh (bikees) ke rashtriya sachiv mohini mohan mishra ne kaha ki kisaan centre sarkaar kii praathamikta main nahin hai
 They demanded that they should get more prices for crops and agricultural products
 mishra ne kaha, "centre sarkaar upabhoktaaon or khaadya padaarthon kii badhati keemton ke bare main kisaan se zyada chintit he
 They are not in the priority of the government
 " unhone kaha ki kisaan krishi saamagree ko adhiktam khudara mulya par kharid rahe hai to unhen nunatam bikri mulya kyon milanaa chahie
 Mishra said that the government should at least ensure that the selling price is 20-30 percent more than the cost of production
 unhone daalon kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki centre sarkaar ne pehle isaki kheti ko protsaahit kiya or phir sasti daalon kaa aayaat kiya
 He said, "the result is that today farmers are not getting fair prices for their products
 " mishra ne kaha ki sarkaar ne gehun par aayaat kar kam kar diya jabaki is saal banpar fasal hui thi
 However, on the ongoing farmer movement in Madhya Pradesh, Mishra said that the current crisis in the state has been created by 'some unruly' elements
 lekin unhone yah bhi kaha ki kisaan niraash hai kyonki rajya sarkaar unki fasal kharidne ke liye aavashyak bandobast nahin kar saki
 He said that BKS will start an indefinite strike against the 'anti-farmer policies' of the state government from June 15 at all divisional headquarters
 tippaniyan (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Mishra said, “the central government is more concerned with consumers and farmers about rising food prices
 ve sarkaar kii praathamikta main nahin hai
 "he said that farmers are buying agricultural material at the maximum retail price, so why should they get the minimum selling price
 mishra ne kaha ki sarkaar ko kam se kam yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki bikri mulya utpaadan kii laagat se 20-30 pratishat adhik ho
 Giving the example of pulses, he said that the central government first encouraged its cultivation and then imported cheap pulses
 unhone kaha, "parinaam yah he ki aaj kisaanon ko unke utpaadon ke uchit mulya nahin mil rahe hai
 "mishra said that the government reduced import tax on wheat even though there was a bumper crop this year
 haalanki madhya pradesh main chal rahe kisaan andolan par mishra ne kaha ki rajya main maujuuda sankat 'kuch updravi' tatwon dwaara rachaa gaya he
 But he also said that the farmers are disappointed because the state government could not make the necessary arrangements to buy their crops
 unhone kaha ki bikees 15 june se sabhi sambhag mukhyalayon par rajya sarkaar kii 'kisaan virdohi nitiyon' ke khilaaf bemiyadi dharna shuru karegaa

 purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa dilli ke ames main guuruuvaar shaam ko 93 varsh kii aayu main nidhan ho gaya
 Vajpayee's demise triggered a wave of mourning across the country
 purv pradhanmantri vaajapeyi ko shradhanjali dene desh ke kaddavar netaa unke ghar pahunche
 Vajpayee was not only a politician and sharp orator but he was also a poet, writer journalist

 At the same time, the issue of sending Indian troops to Iraq was hot
 fouj bhejne ke liye america kaa dabaav tha
 No one was able to figure out a way out of this odd situation
 lekin vaajapeyi ne hansi-majaak main is masale ko sulajhaa diya
 Click here to pay tribute to Atalji, a senior officer who worked with him at the PMO, four years ago himself shared this fact with some journalists, including myself
 vaajapeyi ne ek din vampanthi netaa harkishan singh surajeet ko phone kiya
 On the phone, Vajpayee told Surjeet that 'comrade has been drinking for a long time with you
 abhi chaay pine aa jaao
 (vajpayee used to call Surjeet a comrade in an informal conversation
 )chaay par bulaae commeredsurajeet ne poocha ki masalaa kya he ki achaanak se abhi chaay pine bula rahe hai
 At that time, Vajpayee only replied that he just wanted to drink tea
 surajeet ne kaha ki mere saath abi vardhan bhi hai
 Vajpayee said bring them along
 donon vampanthi netaa vaajapeyi ke ghar pahunch gaye
 As soon as Vajpayee came to know that both the leaders had reached, he welcomed and hugged them both at the gate
 iske baad kamare main teenon baith gaye
 Surjeet asked what was the matter, Pandit, what was to be talked about who had called (surjeet used to call Vajpayee as Pandit in an informal conversation)
 vaajapeyi ne maasoomiyat se kaha ki kuch nahin sirf chaay pinaa he tumhaare saath
 Well, tea has arrived
 jaise hi surajeet ne chaay kaa pyaalaa haath main liya vaajapeyi bol pade, commered america kaa bahut dabaav he, iraq main fouj bhejni hogi
 Surjeet and Vardhan were shocked to hear this
 unhone khub bhadaas nikaali
 In this sequence, the cup of tea was left from Vardhan's hand
 vaajapeyi ne turant chaay dene vaale ko bulaayaa
 After cleaning the table, asked to bring tea again
 chaay dobaaraa aa gai
 Vajpayee then reiterated the same thing that there is a lot of pressure from America
 dobaaraa yah baat sunakar donon vampanthi netaa aag-babula ho gaye or yah kah kar uthne lage ki aap ko kya lagata he ki chaay par charchaa kar ke hamen fouj bhejne ke liye aap manaa lenge
 Why not disrupt Parliament 
 
 yah sunate hi vaajapeyi turant bole ki, commered mujh par chillane se koi phayda nahin
 You are not screaming on the road and Parliament is running smoothly even there
 jaraa congress ke netaaon ko bhi to phone kar bataao ki baat iraq main fouj bhejne kii baat ho rahi he or vipaksh sansad kii kaarywahi chalane de rahaa he
 The opposition is not so aggressive on this issue that it can disrupt the proceedings of the House and protest on the streets
 vaajapeyi ke yah kehete hin turant hi vampanthi netaaon ko baat samaj main aa gai
 From the next day on the issue of sending troops to Iraq, the Left parties started a sit-in protest on the streets and the Congress disrupted the proceedings of the House
 darasal vaajapeyi america ko yah sandesh dena chaahate the ki iraq main bhartiya fouj bhejne ke liye vipaksh raji nahin he
 The entire opposition is so aggressive that protests are taking place in the streets and the functioning of Parliament has come to a standstill
 isliye fouj bhejne ke mudde par raajnneetik sahmati banane kii baat to dur virodh ugr ho gaya he
 And exactly the same happened
 bharat ne america ko aantarik sthiti kaa hawala dete hue fouj bhejne ke aagrah ko thukraa diya tha

 When the unseasonal rains ruined the crop
 
 Even then i went to tell you the situation there
 tab upi ke kai ilaakon se karje ke boj se dabe hue kisaanon kii maut kii khabar ai thi
 Somewhere there was a story of suicide, and somewhere that he died of shock
 us vaqt centre or upi sarkaar ne elaan kiya tha ki mrit kisaanon ke parivaar waalon ko muaavja milegaa
 i reached to see the village of Hazratpur in Bulandshahr
 yah aisa gaanv he, jahaan kuch saal pehle tak manaregaa kii skim chalati thi
 Because of which there was poverty, but not starvation
 usee ke chalate garib ke ghar main bhi frij dikhataa he
 There is also a cooler to kill the heat and the children's uniform is washed everyday

 When the crop was destroyed in April, he died in shock

 There are three children
 
 
 kuch dinon pehle tak
 
 
 All three went to school, but the eldest daughter Kajal has been expelled from school for not paying fees last week

 The cow gives milk which Surekha Devi arranges for bread by selling
 surekha ne hamako bataaya ki baavjood iske ki unke ghar main gaay he, ve khud apane bacchon ko pine ko doodh nahin de paatin kyonki agar doodh bacchon ko diya to ghar kaa kharchaa kaise chalegaa? The picture was strange when they saw food being made here
 khaanaa pet bharne ke liye he, paushtikta dur dur tak nahin
 Just plain bread and boiled potatoes
 surekha devi ne bataaya ki aalu sasta he isliye isse kaam chalata he yaa kabhi chatnee bana lete hai
 
 
 This is how we live
 sabji kharidne kii haisiyat nahin he or daal kii baat yahaan bemaani he
 i then reached Azizabad, a village in Bulandshahr, where the family of the late Bhanwar Singh lives

 If there is no oil, then by adding spices in water, a potato vegetable is made without a tempering
 swargeey bhavar singh kii patni kiran devi kaa kahana he ki daal mahangi he, isliye unke bas kii baat nahin
 a kilo of pulses will cost 40 rupees
 itane main 5 kilo aalu aa jayega or kai din chalegaa, isliye bas aalu khaakar yaa chatnee banaakar hi jindagi chal rahi he
 Sometimes milk is obtained from somewhere, then tea is made, otherwise two small children in the family do not even have milk
 tippaniyan Kiran Devi was also shown a dream of compensation
 abhi tak ek paisa nahin mila he
 It is said that at that time, but nothing was found
 kul milakar is yatra main mujhe do baat samaj ain
 First, the farmers who grow grains for our family grow vegetables for us, their families themselves are currently working by eating potatoes

 And other government schemes are going on as usual
 maheenon ho gaye or muaavje kaa atapata nahin
 Well, while doing this story, it also came to my mind that potato is cheap, so the family of poor farmer is working on it
 lekin agar yah bhi mahangaa hota to phir kisaan kya khaataa? i reached to see the village of Hazratpur in Bulandshahr
 yah aisa gaanv he, jahaan kuch saal pehle tak manaregaa kii skim chalati thi
 Because of which there was poverty, but not starvation
 usee ke chalate garib ke ghar main bhi frij dikhataa he
 There is also a cooler to kill the heat and the children's uniform is washed everyday
 main swargeey prempal singh ke ghar pahunchaa
 When the crop was destroyed in April, he died in shock
 prempal kii patni surekha devi ko ab muaavje kaa intjaar he taaki sir par chadhe do lakh rupee kaa karja chukaa saken
 There are three children
 
 
 kuch dinon pehle tak
 
 
 All three went to school, but the eldest daughter Kajal was thrown out of school last week for not paying fees 
 bachche bade honge to teen bigha jameen par kheti karne laayak honge
 The villagers are currently undergoing kindness
 kisine ek gaay udhaar par di he
 The cow gives milk which Surekha Devi arranges for bread by selling
 surekha ne hamako bataaya ki baavjood iske ki unke ghar main gaay he, ve khud apane bacchon ko pine ko doodh nahin de paatin kyonki agar doodh bacchon ko diya to ghar kaa kharchaa kaise chalegaa? The picture was strange when they saw food being made here
 khaanaa pet bharne ke liye he, paushtikta dur dur tak nahin
 Just plain bread and boiled potatoes
 surekha devi ne bataaya ki aalu sasta he isliye isse kaam chalata he yaa kabhi chatnee bana lete hai
 
 
 This is how we live
 sabji kharidne kii haisiyat nahin he or daal kii baat yahaan bemaani he
 i then reached Azizabad, a village in Bulandshahr, where the family of the late Bhanwar Singh lives
 april main jab fasal kharaab hui thi to inaki sadame se maut ho gai thi
 When it reached the house of late Bhanwar Singh, it was very dark
 yahaan bijli conection nahin he
 Worked with his camera light
 bhavar singh kii patni abhi bhi pati ke achaanak yun chale jane ke sadame se baahar nahin aa pai hai
 We start crying while talking to us
 saat bigha jameen he, lekin karja utaarne ke liye jameen ek saal ke liye kisi or ke hawaale kar di he
 Have two sons but due to lack of farm, they do small wages
 guzaara bahut mushkil se hota he
 The food here also looked exactly the same as shown in the previous village
 yahaan bhi sirf aalu or roti se kaam chalata he
 If there is no oil, then by adding spices in water, a potato vegetable is made without a tempering
 swargeey bhavar singh kii patni kiran devi kaa kahana he ki daal mahangi he, isliye unke bas kii baat nahin
 a kilo of pulses will cost 40 rupees
 itane main 5 kilo aalu aa jayega or kai din chalegaa, isliye bas aalu khaakar yaa chatnee banaakar hi jindagi chal rahi he
 Sometimes milk is obtained from somewhere, then tea is made, otherwise two small children in the family do not even have milk
 tippaniyan Kiran Devi was also shown a dream of compensation
 abhi tak ek paisa nahin mila he
 It is said that at that time, but nothing was found
 kul milakar is yatra main mujhe do baat samaj ain
 First, the farmers who grow grains for our family grow vegetables for us, their families themselves are currently working by eating potatoes
 yaa yun kahen ki hamaare liye paushtik aahaar kaa intjaam karne vaale kisaan kaa parivaar paushtikta se dur he
 And other government schemes are going on as usual
 maheenon ho gaye or muaavje kaa atapata nahin
 Well, while doing this story, it also came to my mind that potato is cheap, so the family of poor farmer is working on it
 lekin agar yah bhi mahangaa hota to phir kisaan kya khaataa? i reached the house of the late Prempal Singh
 april main fasal barbaad hui to unki sadame main maut ho gai
 Prempal's wife Surekha Devi is now awaiting compensation so that she can repay the loan of two lakh rupees on her head
 teen bachche hai
 
 
 Until a few days ago
 
 
 teenon skool jate the, lekin pichley hafte fees na dene ke kaaran sabase badi beti kaajal ko skool se nikaal diya he
 If the children are older, three bighas will be able to cultivate the land
 abhi gaanv waalon kii meharbaani se guzaara ho rahaa he
 Someone lent a cow
 gaay doodh detii he jise bechakar surekha devi roti kaa intjaam karti hai
 Surekha told us that even though there is a cow in her house, she herself could not give milk to her children to drink because if milk is given to the children, how will the expenses of the house go? unke yahaan banate khaane par najar gai to tasviir ajeeb thi
 Food is meant to fill the stomach, not enough nutrition
 bas saadi roti or ublaa hua aalu
 Surekha Devi told that potato is cheap, so it works or sometimes makes chutney
 
 
 aise hi apana guzaara chal rahaa he
 There is no status to buy vegetables and the matter of lentils is meaningless here
 iske baad main bulandshahr ke gaanv azizabad pahunchaa, jahaan par swargeey bhavar singh kaa parivaar rahata he
 When the crop was damaged in April, he died of shock
 swargeey bhavar singh ke ghar pahunche to bilkul andhera
 There is no electricity connection
 apane camere kii lite se kaam chalaaya
 Bhanwar Singh's wife is still unable to come out of the shock of her sudden departure
 hamase baat karte-karte rone lagati hai
 There is seven bighas of land, but to repay the loan, the land has been handed over to someone else for a year
 do bete hai lekin khet na rahane ke kaaran choti-moti mazdooree kar lete hai
 Living is very difficult
 khaane kaa yahan bhi bilkul vaisaa hi haal dikhaa jaisaa pichley gaanv main dikhaa tha
 Here only potato and bread work
 tel nahin he to pani main masaale daalkar bin tadake kii aalu kii sabji banati he
 Kiran Devi, the wife of the late Bhanwar Singh, says that lentils are expensive, so they do not care
 ek kilo daal 40 rupee kii aegi
 5 kg of potatoes will come in this and will last for many days, so life is going on just by eating potatoes or making chutney
 kabhi kahin se doodh mil jaataa he to chaay ban jaati he varanaa parivaar main do chote bacchon ko doodh bhi mayssar nahin he
 The comments kiran devi ko bhi muaavje kaa sapana dikhaaya gaya tha
 Have not received a single penny yet
 kahati hai ki kaha to tha us samay, lekin kuch mila nahin
 Overall, i understood two things in this journey
 pehali jo kisaan hamaare liye hamaare parivaar ke liye anaaj ugaate hai subjiyan ugaate hai, khud unka parivaar is samay bas aalu khaakar kaam chalaa rahaa he
 Or rather, the family of the farmer who provides nutritious food for us is far from nutritious
 or doosraa sarkari yojanaayen hameshaa kii tarah puraani kahani kii tarah chal rahi hai
 It's been months and no compensation
 vaise yah story karte hue mere man main yah bhi aayaa ki aalu sasta he, isliye garib kisaan kaa parivaar isse kaam chal rahaa he
 But if it was too expensive then what would the farmer eat? bachche bade honge to teen bigha jameen par kheti karne laayak honge
 The villagers are currently undergoing kindness
 kisine ek gaay udhaar par di he
 The cow gives milk which Surekha Devi arranges for bread by selling
 surekha ne hamako bataaya ki baavjood iske ki unke ghar main gaay he, ve khud apane bacchon ko pine ko doodh nahin de paatin kyonki agar doodh bacchon ko diya to ghar kaa kharchaa kaise chalegaa? The picture was strange when they saw food being made here

 'prime Minister of PM Modi on Rahul Gandhi said that we cannot sit in front of Congress President, you are a Namdar, we are a Kamdar
 ham to achche kapade bhi nahin pahan sakate hai aapke saamne kaise baithenge
 The PM said tightly and said, 'in whatever language you (rahul) can speak, speak the achievements of the Government of Karnataka without taking the paper in your hand

 Attempts by security forces to capture let militant Abu Dujana in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama failed
 kashmir main lashkar kaa commander abu dujana surakshabalon se bachakar faraar ho gaya
 Army and SOG personnel laid a trap to capture Abu Dujana on Wednesday at Bandherpura village, Pululwamake
 magar dujana kii kismat ne ek baar phir uskaa saath diya or faraar ho gaya
 Two of his companions were also present with Dujana
 isse pehle may maheene main surakshabalon ne pulavama jile ke hakaripora gaanv kii gheraabandi kii thi
 It was reported that Abu Dujana is hiding in the village with his companions
 jise pakadaney ke liye sena ne oparation chalaaya
 During that time it was reported that the villagers helped him to abscond Abu Dujana by throwing stones
 bataa den ki sena kashmir se aatankiyon kaa safaya karne ke liye 'oparation olout' abhiyaan chalaaya he
 Under this, a list of terrorists has been prepared
 jiske aadhaar par alag-alag ilaakon main aatankiyon ke khilaaf search oparation unhen dher kiya ja rahaa he
 So far, about 100 terrorists have been piled into the valley under this operation
 uttar pradesh kii raajnneetik ladaai main 2019 ke is aam chunaav main sabhi partiyon ne apana-apana dam kham dikhaaya, par do partiyaan jo raajnneetik or vichaardhaara se itar is loksabhaa chunaav main gathbandhan kar utari thim unki sthiti itani kharaab ho jaaegi, unhone sapane main bhi nahin sochaa hoga
 We are talking about Akhilesh's Samajwadi Party and Mayawati's BSP
 haalanki is gathbandhan main bispi phaayde main rahi
 The motive of both these parties was to create a new product using the caste equation, but before the reaction of that new equation, the family feuding agent came and demolished everything
 ji haa, is raajnneetik agent ko jahaan professor ramgopal yadav bijepi kii b team kehete hai to akhilesh yadav chachaa or mulaayam singh kaa pyaara chota bhai, itane sab rishte hone ke baavjood parivaar kii kalah itani aage bad gai ki samaajawaadee party se alag hokar nai party banane vaale shivpal yadav parivaar kaa hi kai jagahon par yadav heart land main yadav vot katate nazar aae
 In 2014, the Samajwadi Party won 5 seats without an alliance, so even after the alliance between SP-BSP and RLD in the 2019 general elections, Samajwadi Party did not get more than 5 seats
 maamla saaf he ki akhilesh yadav ne party main apni chalaai to apni nai pragatisheel samaajawaadee party banaakar shivpal yadav ne apni chalaai
 The result is clear that nephew Dharmendra Yadav from Badaun and nephew Akshay Yadav from Firozabad have lost
 yahi nahin akhilesh yadav kii patni dimple yadav bhi modi kii is tsunami main haar gai hai
 Akhilesh's wife Dimple Yadav had a tough fight with Subrata Pathak in the 2014 general elections, so she won by a margin of 19 thousand 907 votes, not by much margin
 haalanki subrat pathak ke liye acchhee baat yah he ki bispi se ummidavaar rahe nirmal tiwari is baar bijepi kheme main hai
 The last time he got 1,27785 votes from here
 haalanki modi lahar ke baavjood is seat se dimple ko jeet hasil hui thi, par is baar shivpal yadav ne haalanki bahu dimple ke kilaaf apana koi candidet maidan main nahin utaara tha par jatigat aankadon ke baazigar rahe shivpal kaa prabhaav kannauj ke 16 pratishat yadavon or 35 fisadi musalamaanon main he
 Here also the effect of family quarrel was seen indirectly
 jiskaa parinaam dimple kii haar main chupa hua he
 The BSP is still seeing some benefit from the alliance, as it has decided its presence in Parliament more than in 2014
 ghaataa samaajawaadee party ko hua he
 Two members of the Yadav family lost to Dharmendra Yadav from Badaun and Akshay Yadav from Firozabad
 yah vanshavaad kii raajnneeti par bhi aghat he jise SP ne badhaava diya
 The decision of alliance with BSP and Rashtriya Lok Dal was made by Akhilesh Yadav as party president
 mulaayam singh yadav ne is par aapatti bhi jataai thi
 This is the first election when Akhilesh contested an election without the guidance of his father Mulayam Singh Yadav
 mulaayam singh apane kshetra mainpuri tak hi simit rahe
 Now questions can be raised on this decision and in the coming days, Akhilesh may have to face a problem in his party
 par yahaan paariwarik kalah ne apana rang saaf-saaf dikhaa diya

 Sachin Tendulkar is the king of records in international cricket but when it comes to first-class cricket, this star batsman is seen miles behind in many major records
 tendulkar agle maheene westeindies ke khilaaf apane kariyar kaa 200waan test match khelenge jo ki aisi uplabdhi hogi jis tak shaayad hi koi cricketer pahunch paae
 Among the cricketers currently playing, the maximum 163 matches have been played by Jacques Kallis of South Africa and the career of this all-rounder is on the run but Tendulkar has played only 307 matches in first-class matches so far and he is the list of most played players
