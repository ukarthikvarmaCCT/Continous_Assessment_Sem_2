 There are two opinions about forming a government within the BJP
 party kaa ek dhada dilli main sarkaar banane ke paksh main he
 He believes that if elections are held now, BJP may have to bear the loss, while the other faction of the party is not in favor of forming government by manipulating
 unka maananaa he ki aisa karne se pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi kii chhavi kharaab hogi
 Apart from this, if the government is formed in Delhi, the name of the candidate for CM will also be decided in this meeting
 saath hi haryana main hone ja rahe vidhansabha chunaav ke ummidavaaron kii pehali list bhi is baithak ke baad chunaav samiti jari kar sakati he
 In the race for development with farming, when the hookah is seen gurgling from place to place, then understand that you are in Haryana
 haryana kii dharti par ek vakt teen laalon kaa dabadabaa tha- bhajanlaal, bansilaal or devilal
 But today the Devi Lal family is struggling with the war of inheritance and the decision of the by-election of Jind is going to decide who will be Devi Lal's legacy
 darasal, devilal ne apni viraasat omprakash chautaala ko saunpi thi, lekin ab omprakash chautaala ke bete ajay or abhaya aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 When Omprakash Chautala handed over the command of his party Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) to his son Abhay Chautala, Ajay formed the new Jananayak Janata Party
 iske baad ajay chautaala ke chote bete digvijay ne party banane ke baad jind upachunaav se taal thonkkar dada devilal kii viraasat par apana daawa bhi thonk diya
 With the cup-plate election symbol, he is in the fray against the specs of the INLD
 jatland main digvijay daawa karte hai ki devilal yugapurush the or jind kii viraasat par haq ko lekar janata jabaab degi
 By the way, Digvijay does not forget to pinch that his grandfather OP Chautala will also be relieved if the election results come
 vaisegind kaa upachunavgar chautaala parivaar ke liye viraasat kii jang he to congress ke liye bhi vaapasi kii badi koshish he
 The Congress, which has been in power in Haryana for years, became the number three party in the state in the last election
 jind se inelo vidhayak ke nidhan ke baad bijepi ne unke bete krishna midda ko ummidavaar bana diya
 Jaiprakash alias JP, a strong leader of the area, left the Congress and became an independent MLA from the adjacent seat
 aise main upachunaav main congress ko khojane par bhi jitau ummidavaar nahin mil rahaa tha
 The decaying Congress party finally made the contest interesting by electing MLA from Kaithal seat in Jind district, Congress in-charge of media department and Randeep Surjewala, close to Rahul Gandhi
 darasal, jab jind kaa masalaarahul gandhike saamne aayaa to majboot ummidavaar nahin hone kii baat sabhi ne kahi
 Meanwhile, Surjewala was knocking in the eyes of the state leaders due to the ever increasing stature in the party
 aise main baaki netaaon ne surajevaala ko jind ke chakravyuuh main abhimanyu banaakar siyaasi shahid banane kii vyuh rachana kii, lekin surajevaala ne sabko chaunkaate hue rahul ke saamne chunauti sweekaar kar lee
 Along with this, Rahul Gandhi resorted to Ahmed Patel to succeed Bahubali in the area before the party leaders and JP who was in the Congress before and succeeded
 ahamed patel se milane ke baad ab jepi surajevaala se apni puraani adaavat bhuulakar unke madadgaar ban gaye hai or khulkar iskaa elaan bhi kar rahe hai
 At the same time, on the question of making Surjewala Abhimanyu to dream of winning Kurukshetra like Arjuna, he does not compare himself to God, but in Kurukshetra, Haryana, he is playing Krishna, not Abhimanyu
 haalanki, digvijay hon yaa bijepi ke midda, donon hi surajevaala ko bahari bataate hai
 On which, the Congressman says that the public considers Surjewala a heavy candidate
 vipakshi ummidavaar bhi jab bahari kehete hai to janata palatakar baari bataa detii he
 With a sympathy wave towards the father, ruling BJP candidate Dr Krishna Midda says that the question of the Khattar government's credibility would come when there is a contest, here the bjp's victory is certain
 midda saaf kehete hai ki modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad phija badali he or yahaan bhi uskaa phayda hi hoga

 After the launch was successful, it would land on the lunar surface on September 6 and 7 in about 55 days

 If the mission is successful, after America, Russia, China, India will be the fourth country to land a rover on the moon
 hamaare liye jaananaa jaruri he ki chandrayan-2, kyon or kitna ahm hai ye mishan
 
 
 What kind of reward? Before Chandrayaan-2, the government cut the salary of ISRO scientists to Moon Mission Chandrayaan-2
 isro ke liye kyon ahm he chandrayan-2 mishan, paanch bade kaaran1
 Demonstrating Scientific Efficiency - When Russia refused, ISRO scientists created the lander-rovernovember 2007 in which Russian space agency Rosskosmos said it would work together in the project
 vah isro ko lander degaa
 In 2008, the mission received approval from the government
 2009 main chandrayan-2 kaa dizin taiyaar kar liya gaya
 The launch was scheduled in January 2013, but the Russian space agency rosscosmos lander could not deliver
 isro ne chandrayan-2 kii lonching march 2018 tay kii
 But for some tests, the launch was postponed to April 2018 and then to October 2018
 is bich, june 2018 main isro ne faisla liya ki kuch badlaav karke chandrayan-2 kii lonching janvari 2019 main kii jaaegi
 Then the launch date was extended to February 2019
 april 2019 main bhi lonching kii khabar ai thi
 It will be clear from the success of this mission that our scientists are not in love with anyone
 ve koi bhi mishan puraa kar sakate hai

 Choosing the Hardest Place: Choose the place on the moon where no country has yet arrived
 According to Isro, Chandrayaan is the 2nd Indian moon mission that will land in the south pole region of the moon with full courage where no country has reached yet - ie the moon's Southern Polar Region

 do ladkiyaan, donon kaa qatl
 And both became puzzles
 kyonki ek main jahaan ladki kaa cheharaa hi gum ho chukaa tha, vahiin duusare cese main ladki sidhe kabr main pahunchaa di gai thi
 The first thing in both of these puzzles was that mysterious murder of Mayanagari Mumbai, in which the girl's identity was lost with death
 23 sitambar 2013 kii subah 3 baje bandra police stesan main phone kii ghanti ghanaghna uthi
 The news received from the other side as soon as the phone was picked up was enough to make the police sleep
 phone karne vaale ne police ko khabar di thi ki bandra si-link ke paas jhaadiyon main kapade kii ek gathree main kisi kii laash padi he
 The police team leaves immediately as soon as the news is received
 si-link par ab bhi gadiyon kaa aana-janaa laga hua tha
 On reaching the spot, there was literally a bundle
 jaise hi police ne us gathree ko kholaa to andar sachmuch laash thi
 a girl's corpse
 lekin haroonges taur par laash kaa sir or dhad gaayab tha
 But by looking at the half-incomplete part of the body, it was known that the corpse belonged to the girl
 ab police ke saamne laash to thi, par adhuri
 Did you know that the dead body belongs to a girl
 par ladki koun he ye nahin pataa
 There was no such thing around that could give the address of the girl's identity
 cheharaa gaayab or duusari koi aisi koi cheez nahin
 Yes, the cloth in which the corpse was wrapped and thrown in the bushes, it was known that the person who died was from a good house
 kyonki kapadaa behad keemtee najar aa rahaa tha
 It is clear from the initial investigation that the murder has been done very brutally
 sar or dhad gaayab karne kaa matlab saaf tha ki kaatil nahin chahta tha ki makatool kii shinaakht ho
 Still, in search of any evidence, the police searched all the nearby bushes, but no evidence was found
 police ne laash ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya
 After this investigation started
 sabase pehle bandra or aasapaas ke thanon se pataa karne kii koshish kii jaati he ki kahin kisi thane main kisi ladki kii gumshudagi yaa apharan kaa maamla to darj nahin he
 But success is not felt
 aasapaas duusari jagahon par kahin laash ke kuch or tukade mili hon, aisi bhi kahin se koi khabar nahin milti
 That is, this case of murder is completely blind
 kaatil gaayab or laash bina chehre ke
 Now what will the police do in such a situation? How will the case be solved? The bandra-worli sea link of Mumbai is a bridge over the sea, through which about 40,000 cars pass through it everyday
 lekin isi si-link se mahaj tees meter kii duuri par mumbai police ko mili ek ladki kii adhakati laash ne uske liye ek nai chunauti khadi kar di he
 An important question is why did the murderer try to dispose of the corpse in such a crowded place? That too when there is not only round the clock heavy traffic, but it also lights up at night
 si-link kaa ek bada aria sisitivi camaron se bhi kaward he
 Apparently, the police also suspect that the girl or the murderer may be related to Bandra or any area of worli
 kyonki si-link ke aas-paas yahi wo ilaake hai, jahaan logon kii rihaaish he
 And usually no murderer would risk going too far with a corpse or their fragments
 zaahir he ab police si-link main riklemeshan kii taraf aane or jane vaale har raste par lage sisitivi camaron ke footage kii jaanch kar rahi he, taaki us jagah par kisi sandigdh gaadi ke rukne yaa phir aisi kisi duusari halchal kaa koi pataa chal sake
 But before the police can get any success in this case, the Mumbai Police wants to find any such girl who has gone missing from all over Mumbai and around
 kyonki is blind murder cese ko sulajhane ke liye police ke saamne jo pehali or iklauti shart he, wo he maranevaali ladki kii shinaakht karnaa
 However, along with the post-mortem of the overcrowded corpse, the police also want to keep some parts of it for DNA testing, so that any claims of identity of the deceased can be verified by matching the DNA with their family members
 kul milakar, ek ladki kii blind murder kaa ye maamla jitna kufnaak, philhal utana hi pechida he
 Now the thing is, a girl from Banaras died and was buried in Kibanaras
 lekin maut ke 16 din baad uske gharavaalon ko is maut se jude ek aise sawaal kaa pataa chalaa, jiskaa jawaab sirf or sirf unki beti hi de sakati thi
 So, the family members buried in the grave decided to ask their daughter the answer
 17 saal kii ladki kii laash kabr se nikaal lee gai
 He died on September 7, 16 days before now
 darasal, is rose subah is ladki ke gharavaalon ko tab sadma laga, jab unhone apni ladli ko ghar ke baahar kii murda haalat main dekha
 At first glance, it seemed that the girl died due to falling from a height
 lihaaza, tab logon ne is takadir kaa khel maanakar naa sirf is haadase ko kubul kar liya, balki usee rose laash kaa antim sanskaar bhi kar diya gaya
 But it was only a few days that Taslim, the girl's mother herself, came to know about the death of her daughter, which made her restless
 ye baat thi qatl kii
 Taslim received the news that his daughter's death was not due to an accident, but because of a well-planned conspiracy
 laash qabr se baahar aa chuki thi
 And the family members had started thinking that their daughter would definitely tell the name of her murderer
 lekin chunki ye maamla katl kaa tha, har sawaal kaa jawaab police ko poochna tha
 Now the questions were of the police and the answer was of the dying girl
 kai sawaal the, jinka jawaab dhundhate hue ladki kii maa jis nattejey par pahunchi, usne naa sirf is maa kii, balki puure parivaar ke kaan khadey kar die
 The family came to know that his daughter was in love with a boy next door and on the night of the incident, the same boy called her on her mobile and called her
 lekin isse pehle ki wo ghar lautati, upar se girakar rahasyamayi haalat main uski jaan chali gai
 Now the family began to think that it was not that the boy next door, after committing a lot of life with his daughter, dropped her from the top to silence her and took her life? But post mortem of the corpse was necessary to find the answer to this question
 jabaki vaardaat ke din beti kii laash ko unhone aanan-fanan main dafn kar diya tha
 So, when the girl mother and her family members realized their mistake, they complained to the police and it was decided to investigate the matter by removing the body from the grave in the presence of a magistrate
 ab laash kabr se baahar nikaali ja chuki he
 Just waiting for the post mortem report
 taaki ye saafe ho sake ki vaaki ye maut koi qatl he yaa phir mahaz ek haadasa

 Can MP ministers with a media formality to roam the street, to teach cashless transactions to shopkeepers, can also declare that they will contest the cashless election in the next election
 i-wolet se hi chanda lenge
 It is being said that the poor people are happy with demonetisation because the rich have lost sleep
 chaiyn kii neend sone vaali usee garib janata ko pataa he ki amiron kii uski suchi main raajnneetik dal, saansad, vidhayak bhi aate hai
 She knows the history of leaders who walk on foot before winning, and after winning, they become the master of immense wealth
 kya janata ko aath november ke baad hui tamaam reliyon main dikh rahaa he ki ve pehle se saadi ho gai hai
 Does he not hear now that people are not being brought to any rally by giving two hundred, five hundred
 agle saal paanch rajyon main chunaav honge
 The poor people will wake up the night before the election when no leader comes to distribute notes and liquor
 vaise is maamle main bhi badnaam garib hi kiya jaataa he
 It is divided into ten or five, big local leaders, sarpanchs, pradhans, sold in lakhs overnight and are converted from Congress to BJP and BJP to BJP
 raajnneetik dalon kii vittiya vyavastha kaise paardarshee ho
 The debate has been going on for many years, but after many years the debate dies down
 notebandi or cashles kii tarah chande ko lekar ratorat faisle kaa elaan kyon nahin ho saktaa he
 If there is some deficiency, then new rules will be made
 chandon ke maamle main kisi raajnneetik dal kaa record acha nahin he
 Go to the website of the Association for Democratic Reform ADR, an organization that constantly researches and makes people aware of this topic
 unke shodh ke aadhaar par di vir main vaishali ravat or hemanth singh ne ek lekh likhaa he
 The ADR has studied the calculation of donations from six national parties between 2004 and 2012
 kisi ne nahin bataaya ki 75 fisadi chanda kahaan se aayaa he
 You know that parties have to give details only after the donation of more than 20,000, but ADR says that in this case also political parties do not give correct information about PAN number to check number
 apane chande kaa 80 fisadi hissaa 20,000 kii rakam se neeche dikhaa dete hai taaki detail na bataanaa pade
 According to the ADR, there is no provision for punishment or strict punishment against political parties for not providing a correct report
 jabaki aap agar iskar ritern main jaankaree galat de den to mushkil main pad sakate hai
 The Election Commission should tell whether political parties account for item wise expenditure or lump sum
 agar item waayiz hisaab dete hai to kya unke paas reliyon ke kharche ko lekar die gaye aankadon kaa koi byora he
 There is a description of the helicopter to know how much our leaders spend
 ek hi helicopter kitne paise main bijepi ke netaa ko le jaataa he or kitne paise main congress ke netaa ko
 Did the congress-bjp think when a law was changed this year to make a way for itself to get donations from foreign companies
 jabaki dilli hoicourt ne bijepi or congress ko landan sthit company vedanta se chanda lene ke maamle main doshi mana tha or karrwai kaa aadesh diya tha
 Do you know that six national political parties do not file IT returns on time
 is maamle main ediaar kii research kahati he ki bijepi, congress, ensipi sab doshi hai
 When the return of the general public is scrutinized, then under which law is the scrutiny of the returns of political parties
 2012-13 or 2014-15 main bijepi ne bataaya hi nahin ki chanda kaise-kaise mila
 Congress did not provide a PAN number in 2013-14
 is vakt har dal chande ko lekar bahes kii baat kar rahaa he
 One issue has been that there should be a state fund for election expenses
 kisi ne ise neshnal fund kaha he to kisi ne ise public fund kaha he
 The idea of the State Fund is good
 lekin ise lekar kai sawaal abhi puche jane chahie
 How much will the national party get from the state fund, how much will the regional party get, how much will the new party get
 kya sabko baraabar milegaa yaa alag-alag milegaa
 Many candidates have cases of assets worth six to six hundred crores, why should their expenses be raised from public funds
 garib ummidavaar kaa kharchaa sarkaar uthaae yah baat to samaj aati he lekin kisi ummidavaar kii haisiyat hajaar karod kii he to uskaa chunavi kharchaa bharat kii garib janata kyon uthaae
 According to one figure, 449 mps out of 543 in the current Lok Sabha have assets of one crore or more
 jis party ke sabase adhik karodpati ummidavaar hon kyon na use kam chanda diya jaae
 This will give the poor a chance to come forward in politics
 aapke ankar ko lagata he ki yah idia janata ke paise se amir or shahi gharaanon ke ummidavaaron ko madad karnaa he
 It is another matter that your anchor is not special
 isaki kya guarantee he ki state fund se bijness gharaanon par raajnneetik dalon kii nirbharta kam ho jaaegi
 There is a plea that the idea of the State Fund cannot be successful until politics is eradicated from criminalization
 kyon public ke paise se kisi bahubali yaa mafia ke chunaav ko fund kiya janaa chahie
 There is a limit on the expenses of the candidates
 tamaam nakebandiyon ke baad bhi ayog jaanata he or maanata he ki bahut se ummidavaar seemaa se zyada kharchaa karte hai

 How to make the financial arrangements of political parties transparent
 kai saal se is par bahes chal rahi he magar kai saal se bahes chalakar dam tod detii he
 Like demonetisation and cashless, why can't an overnight decision be announced regarding donations
 kuch kami rah jaaegi to nae niyam or ban jaaenge
 In the case of Chandas, no political party has a good record
 is vishay par lagaataar shodh karne vaali or janata ko jaagruk karne vaali sanstha association for democratic rifarm ediaar kii website par jaakar dekhie
 Vaishali Rawat and Hemant Singh have written an article in The Wire based on their research
 ediaar ne 2004 se 2012 ke bich chah rashtriya dalon ke chande ke hisaab kaa adhyayan kiya he
 No one has said where 75 percent of the donations came from
 aap jaanate hai ki 20,000 se adhik kaa chanda hone par hi dalon ko detail dena hota he magar ediaar kaa kahana he ki is maamle main bhi raajnneetik dal pan number se lekar check number kii sahi sahi jaankaree nahin dete hai
 80 per cent of their donations are shown below the amount of 20,000 so that details do not have to be reported
 ediaar ke anusaar sahi report na dene par raajnneetik dalon ke khilaaf sajaa yaa sakht sajaa kaa praavdhaan nahin he
 Whereas if you give incorrect information in the income tax return then you may get in trouble
 chunaav ayog ko bataanaa chahie ki raajnneetik dal item waayiz kharche kaa hisaab dete hai yaa ekamusth
 If the items give wise accounts, do they have any details of the figures given for the expenses of the rallies
 helicopter kaa koi byora he jisase pataa chale ki hamaare netaa kitna kharchaa karte hai
 How much money does a single helicopter take to a BJP leader and how much money to a Congress leader
 kya congress-bijepi ne tab sochaa tha jab is saal ek kanoon main badlaav kar apane liye videshi companiyon se chanda lene kii chhot kaa rasta bana liya
 While the Delhi High Court held the BJP and Congress guilty in the case of taking donations from London-based company Vedanta and ordered action
 kya aapako pataa he ki chah rashtriya raajnneetik dal samay par iti ritern nahin bharte hai
 Research by ADR in this case says that BJP, Congress, NCP are all guilty
 jab aam janata ke ritern kii scrootni hoti he to raajnneetik dalon ke ritern kii scrootni kis kanoon ke tahat manaa he
 In 2012-13 and 2014-15, the BJP did not even tell how the donations were received
 congress ne 2013-14 main pan number hi nahin bataaya
 Right now every party is talking about the debate on donations
 ek masalaa chalaa he ki chunaav ke kharche ke liye state fund ho
 Some have called it a national fund and some have called it a public fund
 state fund kaa idia acha he
 But many questions should be asked about it now
 state fund se neshnal party ko kitna milegaa, kshetreey party ko kitna milegaa, nai party ko kitna milegaa
 Will everyone get equal or different? bahut se ummidavaaron ke chah-chah sau karod kii sampatti ke maamle hote hai, inkaa kharchaa public fund se kyon uthaaya janaa chahie
 It is understandable that the government should bear the expenses of poor candidates, but the status of a candidate is thousand crores, so why should the poor people of India bear their election expenses
 ek aankade ke mutabik maujuuda loksabhaa main 543 main se 449 saansadon ke paas ek karod yaa isse zyada kii sampatti he
 The party which has the highest number of millionaires, why not give it less
 isse raajnneeti main garibon ko aage aane kaa mauka milegaa
 Your anchor feels that this idea is to help the candidates of the rich and royal houses with public money
 yah or baat he ki aapkaa ankar koi vishesh nahin he
 What is the guarantee that the State Fund will reduce the dependence of political parties on business houses
 ek daleel he ki jab tak raajnneeti se apradheekaran nahin mitega tab tak state fund kaa vichaar safal nahin ho saktaa
 Why the election of any Bahubali or Mafia should be funded with public money
 abhi ummidavaaron ke kharche kii ek seemaa tay he
 Despite all the blockades, the Commission knows and believes that many candidates spend more than the limit
 jab yahi lagu nahin ho sakaa to state fund se ham kya hasil karne vaale hai
 The comments indian express kii ek report he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was addressing a gathering in Hardoi, UP for the Lok Sabha elections on 21 April 2014
 vahaan unhone aapraadhik maamalon vaale saansadon ke bare main ek pran kiya tha
 If reminded of this and they take the initiative, before 2019, many mps with criminal charges may be asked to leave the Lok Sabha
 kai saansad aarope mukt bhi ho sakate hai
 The PM gave a slogan
 aparaadhiyon se mukt karo parliament ko
 According to ADR data, 98 BJP mps have mentioned criminal cases in their affidavits
 shivasena ke 18 saansadon main se 15 ne aapraadhik maamalon kaa zikr kiya he
 8 out of 44 Congress mps are like this
 chunki yah mahina sant hone or naitik hone kaa he isliye puraani baat yaad dilaa di
 One good effect of demonetisation is that the credibility of political parties has also come into the public eye
 chandon ke maamle main kisi raajnneetik dal kaa record acha nahin he

 There is a plea that the idea of the State Fund cannot be successful until politics is eradicated from criminalization
 kyon public ke paise se kisi bahubali yaa mafia ke chunaav ko fund kiya janaa chahie
 There is a limit on the expenses of the candidates
 tamaam nakebandiyon ke baad bhi ayog jaanata he or maanata he ki bahut se ummidavaar seemaa se zyada kharchaa karte hai
 When the same could not apply, what are we going to get from the State Fund? tippaniyan There is a report by Indian Express
 21 april 2014 ko loksabhaa chunaav ke liye upi ke hardoi main pradhanmantri narendra modi ek sabha ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 There he made a vow about mps with criminal cases
 agar uski yaad dilaai jaae or ve pahal kar den to 2019 se pehle aapraadhik aaropon vaale kai saansadon kii loksabhaa se vidaai ho sakati he
 Many mps may also be free of charges
 piem ne ek naaraa diya tha
 Free Parliament from the criminals ediaar ke aankadon ke anusaar bijepi ke 98 saansadon ne apane halafname main aapraadhik maamalon kaa zikr kiya he
 Of the 18 Sena mps, 15 have referred criminal cases
 congress ke 44 main se 8 saansad aise hai
 Reminded the old thing since it is a month of being a saint and being moral
 notebandi kaa ek acha asar to he ki raajnneetik dalon kii saakh bhi public kii nigaah main aa gai he
 Right now every party is talking about the debate on donations
 ek masalaa chalaa he ki chunaav ke kharche ke liye state fund ho
 Some have called it a national fund and some have called it a public fund
 state fund kaa idia acha he
 But many questions should be asked about it now
 state fund se neshnal party ko kitna milegaa, kshetreey party ko kitna milegaa, nai party ko kitna milegaa
 Will everyone get equal or different? bahut se ummidavaaron ke chah-chah sau karod kii sampatti ke maamle hote hai, inkaa kharchaa public fund se kyon uthaaya janaa chahie
 It is understandable that the government should bear the expenses of poor candidates, but the status of a candidate is thousand crores, so why should the poor people of India bear their election expenses
 ek aankade ke mutabik maujuuda loksabhaa main 543 main se 449 saansadon ke paas ek karod yaa isse zyada kii sampatti he
 The party which has the highest number of millionaires, why not give it less
 isse raajnneeti main garibon ko aage aane kaa mauka milegaa
 Your anchor feels that this idea is to help the candidates of the rich and royal houses with public money
 yah or baat he ki aapkaa ankar koi vishesh nahin he
 What is the guarantee that the State Fund will reduce the dependence of political parties on business houses
 ek daleel he ki jab tak raajnneeti se apradheekaran nahin mitega tab tak state fund kaa vichaar safal nahin ho saktaa
 Why the election of any Bahubali or Mafia should be funded with public money
 abhi ummidavaaron ke kharche kii ek seemaa tay he
 Despite all the blockades, the Commission knows and believes that many candidates spend more than the limit
 jab yahi lagu nahin ho sakaa to state fund se ham kya hasil karne vaale hai
 The comments indian express kii ek report he
 in Hardoi, UP for the Lok Sabha elections on 21 April 2014 
 vahaan unhone aapraadhik maamalon vaale saansadon ke bare main ek pran kiya tha
 If reminded of this and they take the initiative, before 2019, many mps with criminal charges may be asked to leave the Lok Sabha

 The PM gave a slogan
 aparaadhiyon se mukt karo parliament ko
 According to ADR data, 98 BJP mps have mentioned criminal cases in their affidavits
 shivasena ke 18 saansadon main se 15 ne aapraadhik maamalon kaa zikr kiya he
 8 out of 44 Congress mps are like this
 chunki yah mahina sant hone or naitik hone kaa he isliye puraani baat yaad dilaa di
 One good effect of demonetisation is that the credibility of political parties has also come into the public eye

 pakistan ne desh ke nakshe main kashmir ko bharat ke hisse ke rup main dikhaaye jane par punjab praant ke nijee skulon main saamaajik adhyayan kii kitabon par pratibandh laga diya he
 The Punjab Curriculum and Textbook Board (PCTB), a government body, has demanded action on this mistake
 saath hi is tarah kii 'gambhir galati' karne ke liye kitabon ke prakashkon or nijee skulon ke prashasan ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamla darj karne ke liye lahore police main ek shikaayat bhi darj karai he
 All the district magistrates of the province have been instructed to confiscate these books from private school godowns

 The notification states, 'the social studies books of the second, fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth class have disputed / objectionable content, especially with reference to the map of Pakistan showing Kashmir as part of India
 'bordne kaha ki bhavishya main is tarah kii galatiyon ko rokane ke liye koi bhi vyakti board kii purv anumati ke bina ek santhaan main kisi bhi pathyapustak yaa poorak saamagree kaa mudran, prakaashan or bikri nahin karegaa
 Arvind Kejriwal handed over more than nine lakh rupees to the government to resolve the issue related to his resignation from the IRS service
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki vah virodh swaroop aisa kar rahe hai or iskaa yah matlab nahin ki unhone koi galati maani he
 Kejriwal has written a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with a check of nine lakh 27 thousand 787 and urged him not to 'disturb' his six friends including Magsaysay Award winner Harish Hande
 inhen logon ne kejariwal ko yah raashi udhaar di he
 This move by 43-year-old Kejriwal is being seen as a response to the attacks on Team Anna
 gauratlab he ki sarkaar kii ore yah kaha gaya tha ki kejariwal ne iares (bhartiya rajasav seva) main teen saal puure hone se pehle hi seva chhod puure vetan par adhyayan avkaash par ja kar anubandh niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya he
 However, Kejriwal says that he took a non-paid leave and left the service after fulfilling the terms of the contract
 unhone pradhanmantri ko likhe chaar pannon ke patr main kaha, ‘main patr ke saath nau lakh 27 hajaar 787 rupye kaa check bhi bhej rahaa hum
 But that does not mean that i have accepted the mistake
 jab mujhe yahi nahin pataa ki maine kya galati kii he, to ise maanane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 'kejriwal wrote,' i am returning this amount as a protest
 main aapse apil karata hum ki aap grih mantri ko meraa istipha manjuur karne kaa nirdesh den
 Once my resignation is approved, i will have the right to go to court to withdraw this amount
 ’kejariwal ne daawa kiya ki unke paas koi bachat raashi nahin he or bhugtan ke liye unhone apane chah mitron se karj liya he
 He said that many people offered him money but he did not take it as it meant that the anti-corruption movement could be misused
 unhone kaha, ‘isliye maine un logon se karj liya jinhen main kai saal se jaanata hum
 The whole government machinery is behind Team Anna
 main aapse haath jodakar anurodh karata hum ki aapaki sarkaar un logon ko pareshaan nahin kare jinhone mujhe karj diya he
 Kejriwal took a study leave on full pay for two years on November 1, 2000, during the Revenue Service
 unhone ek band par dastakhat kiye the jiske mutabik yadi vah adhyayan avkaash ke teen saal ke bheetar istipha dete hai yaa sevanivrutt hote hai yaa seva par nahin lautate to unhen puraa vetan lautaanaa hoga
 Kejriwal again arrived at the office on November 1, 2002 but after 18 months took leave without pay
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki 18 maheene baad chuttee lenaa band kii sharton kaa ulanghan tha
 Kejriwal opposed the plea that he did not break any provision of bond and resigned from the job after three years of returning to service after his study leave
 mukhya iskar ayukta karyaalay ne paanch agast ko kejariwal ko notice jari kiya tha or 9
 Asked to pay Rs 27 lakh
 jis par kejariwal or anna paksh ke anya sadasyon ne ise raajnneetik aakaaon ke nirdeshon par sarkari vibhaag kii karrwai qaraar diya
 Kejriwal claimed in his letter that he did not violate any rules
 unhone kaha, ‘lekin aapaki sarkaar mujhase byaaj samet vetan lautaane ko kah rahi he jo maine adhyayan avkaash ke dauraan liya
 'he argued,' Your government is asking me what i did in two years' leave without pay
 is avadhi main maine artiai kaa masauda taiyaar kiya tha
 Kejriwal said that he received international honors like the Magasayasay award during the same period when he was on leave, but this is wrong in the eyes of the government and accusing him of wrongdoing
 unhone kaha, ‘main aapse poochna chahta hum ki bina vetan ke chhuttiyon ke dauraan artiai ke liye kaam karte vakt maine kya aparaadh kiya jo mujhe nahin karnaa chahie tha
 i request you to please tell me what i did wrong
 ’ kejariwal ne kaha ki vah pichley paanch saal se sarkaar ko yah bataane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai ki unhone kuch galat nahin kiya he
 He said, 'I have been told that this time the Prime Minister's Office has also seen my file and i also think that i am wrong
 mujhe samaj nahin aayaa ki maine kya aparaadh kiya jiske liye mujhe dandit kiya ja rahaa he
 Can anyone tell me what i did wrong, so that i do not in the future
 ’kejariwal ne kaha ki unhone yah vaada karte hue do saal kaa adhyayan avkaash liya tha ki bijli or peedies kshetra main bhrashtachar se nipatane ke liye jaankaree jutaayenge
 He said, 'after returning to work, i was not given any responsibility for more than a year
 main bina kaam ke vetan le rahaa tha
 i got it wrong
 mere paas chuttee nahin thi
 So i decided to take leave without pay
 meri chuttee manjuur bhi kii gayi

 In the meeting, Manmohan said, 'the government is looking for a possible solution to the current situation
 ’ baithak ke dauraan sirf samaajawaadee party ne is prastaav kaa virodh kiya
 Leaders of several parties, including the main opposition party BJP, suggested that the government should not take a hasty decision and bring a constitutional amendment bill only after careful consideration of all the parties
 teen ghante chali baithak ke baad pradhanmantri karyaalay main rajyamantri ve narayansami ne kaha, ‘sabhi rajnatik dalon ke vichaar sunne ke baad pradhanmantri ne kaha ki sarkaar or congress anusuchit jati-janajati ko padonnati main aarakshan dene ke pakshdhar hai
 Courts have rejected similar provisions of some states
 is tarah ke sanshodhan ko kanoonee rup se tikaoo hona chaiye

 The poster of the film 'blue Mountains' starring Ranveer Shorey, Gracie Singh and Rajpal Yadav was released in Mumbai yesterday
 film 7 april ko relies ho rahi he
 Blue Mountains is the story of how young youngsters reach the seventh sky, excited by the success achieved after becoming an overnight star through a reality show
 film kii prishthbhumi shimla kii he
 Produced by Rajesh Jain, the film is directed by Suman Ganguly while the film's music is ordered by Srivastava and Monty Sharma
 is dauraan kuch yuvakon ne usapar or uske dost par hamalaa kar diya
 After this, the accused youth took him to the nearby forest and they gang-raped him
 gauratlab he ki aisa hi ek maamla shimla main aayaa tha
 Where the accused had raped and murdered the girl returning from school
 police philhal is maamle main aasapaas ke logon se poochtacha ke aadhaar par aropiyon kii pahchaan karne main juty he
 (from input language) vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle uttarakhand main beeti raat alag−alag jagahon se police ne 43 lakh rupee cash baraamad kiya
 According to the police, such a large amount of black money was being taken for election use in Champawat and Khatima
 police ne is maamle main teen logon ko hiraasat main liya he
 On the basis of intelligence information, the police seized two vehicles from Ramnagar area and one from Dehradun and recovered these money
 philhal chunaav adhikari inakam tex or state police ke adhikari is maamle kii jaanch kar rahe hai jin paanch rajyon main chunaav hona he un rajyon se ab tak saath karod rupee se zyada cash pakadaa gaya he
 Police have detained three people in this case
 police ne khufia soochna ke aadhaar par ramnagar ilaake se do or dehradun se ek gaadi ko sij kar in rupayon ko baraamad kiya

 dilli-ensiaar main har din badhata pradooshan yahaan ke bashindon se lekar dilli ghoomane aane vaale paryatakon ke liye bhi mushkilon kaa kaaran banataa ja rahaa he
 But you will be surprised to know that this pollution is helping to keep Delhi's rising temperature low by 2 to 3 degrees even in terrible heat
 haalia research main is baat kaa khulaasa hua he ki duusare padosi shaharon ke mukaable dilli main taapmaana kam he jiskaa kaaran kuch or nahin balki dilli kaa badhata pradooshan he
 Scientists have named this process as the 'urban cooling effect' which can be felt twice a year
 pehali baar garmiyon main may or june ke maheene main or duusari baar sardiyon main oktober se disambar ke maheenon main
 In other cities than Delhi, the opposite happens in these months, which scientists have named as 'urban Heat Island', in which the temperature gets higher due to being trapped in the heat environment
 dilli ke pradooshan main arosol naam ke pradooshak kii matraabhayanak garmior sardi ke mausam main bad jaati he
 According to scientists, due to this pollutant, the temperature of Delhi decreases
 darasal arosol pradooshak kii kuch shrenee suraj kii tej kirnon ko sokh leti he jabaki kuch kism kii kirnon ko riflact kar detii hai
 Due to this, strong rays do not reach Delhi
 research ke mutabik arosol kii maatra din ke samay main vaataavaran main zyada hoti he isliye dilli din ke samay duusare rajyon se thandi he jabaki raaton ko dilli kaa taapmaana duusare shaharon se zyada hota he
 Environmentalist Vimalendu says, 'aerosols are highly particulate matter and are also present in dust, sea salt, sand, sulfate, nitrate, mineral dust and atmospheric moisture
 garmiyon main jaise hi zamin sukhi hoti hapradooshan bad jaataa hajo arosol ko janm detaa he
 'however, if we consider environmentalism, it is not a matter of happiness but a matter of concern for us
 aapako bataa den ki ye research iaiti mumbai ne bhi kii thi
 Apart from this, JNU, National Physical, Central University of Punjab, Tezpur University and Indian Institute of Remote Sensing have done jointly
 isamen march 2000 se november 2011 tak ke aankadon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 From this, it can be estimated that how much the pollution level of Delhi must have increased from 2011 till now

 Kripa Shankar started the letter citing his own 4 decades of public life
 saath hi likhaa ki ve anuchhed 370 or 35e ko hataae jane ke achche prabhaavon ko lekar jaagrukta badhaane main lage hai
 It has been said in the letter that out of all the apples produced in the country, 70% comes from Kashmir
 seb kaa kashmir kii arthvyavastha main salanaa 1200 karod rupee kaa yogadan rahata he
 historicalprishankar told the removal of Article 370, 35A, while the removal of Article 370, 35A was a historic and glorious step, while also saying that 'the closure of the market in Kashmir has affected the business there
 aise main jahaan sarkaar kii ore se jammu or kashmir main seb utpaadakon ko seb ke uchit daam dilaae jane ke liye kadam uthaae ja rahe hai, aise main ham sab ko bhi kashmiri logon, vahaan kii arthvyavastha ko samarthan dekar ye dikhaanaa chahie ki ham unke saath hai

 This is a misuse of options, it should be banned

 The court said that if the President rejects Rahm's appeal, can the Governor of the state again consider Rahm's appeal? If the governor approves the appeal and gives relief to the guilty, will it not be a matter of embarrassment for the President? The Center should tell whether a law needs to be enacted on this issue, or has any procedure been laid down in advance

 If circumstances change, a mercy petition can be filed with the governor and the governor can decide on the petition

 In Palanpur, PM Modi targeted Mani Shankar Iyer, who insulted Gujarat, why did he hold a secret meeting with the Pakistani High Commissioner? After all, why are people in Pakistan holding high positions in the Army and Intelligence talking about helping to make Ahmed Patel the CM in Gujarat? What is the reason for this? PM Modi also said why secret meetings were held with Pakistani High Commissioner? He quoted Iyer's statement that he insulted not me but the whole of Gujarat
 piem modi ne ye bhi kaha ki is gupt meeting main purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh or pakistan ke purv videsh mantri ne bhi hissaa liya
 Modi said that former Pakistan Army DG had said that Ahmed Patel should become the CM of Gujarat

 He said, 'there was a meeting at Mani Shankar Iyer's house
 jisamen pakistan ke ucchayukta, purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh the or uske baad unhone kaha ki modi neech he

 PM Modi claimed that former Pakistan army chief Rashid supported making Ahmed Patel the chief minister of Gujarat

 In fact, Mani Shankar Aiyar used the word objectionable against the Prime Minister

 In this list, names are becoming one after the other and bjp's narrative does not seem to end
 pehle jaswant out hue phir shouri ne visphot kiya or iske baad kulkarni ne by-by kar diya
 But the matter did not stop here
 purv rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar brajesh mishrabhi bol pade hai
 He has surrounded Advani saying that Advani was fully aware of the decision taken to release the terrorists in exchange for the release of the passengers in the Kandahar incident and that the statement of Mishra was accompanied by the then Union Minister Yashwant Sinha

 After 68 years of independence, today our country is growing continuously in every field
 chaahe shiksha ho yaa scince yaa iconmi
 But our boat in the playground has been staggered, be it the Olympics or the Commonwealth our medals tally has not been very admirable
 ham fifa under 17 world cap host karne vaale hai par hamaari footbal team kii ranking 147 he
 The hockey which we used to be, we have slipped to number 9 even today
 aaie jaanate hai ki aakhir kya hai is halaat ko sudhaarney ke upaay
 1- Removing politics from sports: Political leaders are sitting in important positions in every sports organization in India, whose understanding of the game is absolutely zero
 unako sirf apni jeben bharne se matlab he, khilaadiyon ko koi suvidha uplabdh karaane main unki khaas dilchaspee nahin rahati
 If these organizations replace the former players in place of politicians, then the situation of every game will improve
 kyonki ek khilaadi kii maansikta or jaruraton ko us daur se guzar chukaa yaa usase lagaav rakhane vaala vyakti hi behatar samaj saktaa he
 2- Training from ground level, whether it is China, Australia or America, training is given to children from ground level in all these countries
 vahaan proper acedemies banaai gai hai
 But in our country, talented sportspersons do not get proper training nor academies of their own kind
 agar desh ke har kone main vishesh academiyaan banaai jaaen jahaan ground level se bacchon ko proper training di jaae to nishchit hi halaat sudharenge
 Possibly such arrangements should be made available in schools so that children think of taking sports as a career
 3- takanic kaa behatar prayopub har khel main technology kii dakhlandaji kaaphi bad gai he
 Cricket, football, hockey, in every sport, there is a need of coaching in which technology is better used
 har khel se judi technology hamaare khilaadiyon or kochon ko uplabdh karai jaae
 Technical training is given a lot of pressure in European countries
 jiske dam par wo desh aaj har khel main champion hai
 Along with this, proper turf should also be provided for sports like wrestling, football, hockey, boxing
 4- sports bajet kaa sadupyogsports bajet ke naam par jo paisa sarkaar har saal detii he usase youth academy banane ke saath hi desh ke vibhinn konon se chhipe tallent ko dhundne or taraashne main lagaaya jaae to nishchit rup se hamaari sthiti sudharegi
 The Government of India should also increase the sports budget because the facilities needed to build the best players
 unako paane ke liye zyada paisa chahie
 To encourage the players, they have to provide better facilities
 desh ke yuva khilaadiyon ko behatar fahrren khilaadiyon ke saath khilne kaa mauka milanaa chahie taaki wo apane khel ko or behatar kar saken
 5- Relaxation in passport rules
 Players of Indian origin holding foreign passports do not get a chance to play on behalf of India
 jabaki anya deshon main aisa nahin he unke nakshe kadam par chalate hue hamaare bhi niyamon main sanshodhan hona chahie
 This will give those good players in every game an opportunity to play for India, which can help us win a lot but, due to the rules, we are still unable to do so
 madhyapradesh main van kshetron main junglee suar or nilgai ke shikaar kii anumati dene ke liye niyamon main sanshodhan kaa maamla tool pakadta ja rahaa he or purv kendriya mantri menka gandhi ne pradesh ke van mantri sartaaj singh ko mantrimandal se nikaale jane kii maang kii he
 The forest department has sent a proposal to the government to amend the rules for hunting of indigo and wild boar with respect to the destruction of crops in the state
 purv kendriya mantri or jaanwaron ke adhikaron ko lekar kaary karne vaali menka gandhi ne rajya sarkaar ke is faisle kaa kadaa virodh karte hue van mantri ko tatkaal mantrimandal se nikaale jane kii maang kii he
 Maneka Gandhi said that she will also take up the matter with the BJP high command
 menka gandhi kaa maananaa he ki rajya sarkaar dwaara yah faisla kisaanon ke hit main nahin liya gaya he balki is faisle kaa phayda ve nijee foresti laaj oparator uthaayenge jinke graahak middle east tathaa anya deshon main faile hue hai
 He said that this decision has been taken by the Forest Minister under pressure from these tour operators
 menka gandhi ne kaha ki desh main vanya jeevon kii sankhya pehle hi kam ho rahi he tathaa empi sarkaar ke is faisle se unki sankhya main or kami hi aayegi
 He said that he has never seen a wild pig in his life and therefore there is no justification for allowing his prey to be told that their numbers are increasing and they are guilty of destroying the crop
 unhone kaha ki jab ek shikari ko shikaar ke liye van main jane kii anumati de di jaayegi to van main rahane vaale anya jaanwaron kii kya goliyon kii awaajon ke bich shanti bhang nahin ho jaayegi or kya anya jaanavar surakshit rah paayenge
 Angered by this decision of the Madhya Pradesh government, Maneka Gandhi also raised the question that whether the animals living in the forest will not turn to the villages and urban areas due to the action of the poachers and what is the guarantee that the prey of indigo and wild boars During accident, an elephant or other animal will not die due to shot
 is bich van mantri sartaaj singh kaa kahana he ki madhyapradesh main pichley 12 saalon se in jaanwaron ke shikaar par koi pratibandh nahin he lekin kade niyamon or praavdhaanon ke chalate log in jaanwaron kaa shikaar nahin kar pate kisaanon kii kaaphi fasal nasht hoti he
 The Forest Minister said that in this regard, we have sent a proposal to the Law Ministry for simplification of rules regarding hunting of wild boar and nilgai and it will be implemented only if the proposal is approved
 unhone kaha ki pradesh ke kisaanon or janpratinidhiyon ne in jaanwaron dwaara fasalon kaa nuksaan kiye jane kaa maamla uthaate hue sarkaar se is sambandh main kadam uthaane kii maang kii thi
 Chief Chief Conservator of Forests of Madhya Pradesh R
 ke
 Dave said that in view of the damage done to crops in the state, the right to kill wild boar and nilgai has been given since the year 2000 by the order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate
 dave ne kaha ki is maamle main niyam itane kade hai ki aaj tak koi bhi in jaanwaron ko maarane kii anumati nahin le paaya he tathaa isko dekhte hue yah mahasoos kiya gaya ki niyamon kaa sarleekaran kiya jaye or is sambandh main prastaav rajya sarkaar ke samaksh vichaaradhin he
 RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav has stepped up the campaign to unite the opposition

 isi silsile main argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ne bispi adhyaksh mayawati se phone par baat kii or raashtrapati chunaav main mayawati se madad kii maang kii

 mayawati kaa rajyasabha kaa kaarykaal 2018 main samaapt ho rahaa he or uttarapradesh main unki party kii jo sthiti he usase unka dobaaraa rajyasabha main janaa sambhav nahin he
 According to sources, Laloo Prasad Yadav has also invited Mayawati to a rally in Patna on August 27

 The National Investigative Agency (NIA) has revealed that India-based organization is on the radar of ISIS
 agency ne yah bhi daawa kiya he ki aatankiyon ke paas bharat main hamale kaa khaakaa taiyaar he

 India's most famous religious leader, 84-year-old Shree Sathya Sai Baba is recuperating after a serious illness at Puttaparthi in Andhra Pradesh, but the outline of the transfer of his legacy has already been drawn
 aadhyatmik guru 1972 main sthapit sarvashaktisampannshri satya sai central trust(esaxssiti) ke adhyaksh pad se jab hat jaaenge uske baad unke vishaal samrajya ko chalaane ke faisle yah trust hi karegaa
 The trust looks after the operations of the welfare units, which include educational and health facilities, and also controls the book of several trusts with the help of a team of sharp auditors
 lekin jab satya sai baba ke network kii apaar daulat kii baat aati he, to esaxssiti apana munh band rakhata he
 Baba's total assets are believed to be around Rs 40,000 crore
 ke aasapaas kii he, jisamen bharat ke alaava 165 deshon main unki chal or achal sampatti shaamil he
 Most of his money is spent in schools, colleges, hospitals and other healthcare facilities
 unke 60 lakh sakriy shraddhaluon ke alaava 3 karod 10 lakh saadhaaran bhakton se milane vaala chanda treston ke pehle se hi labalab bhare khajaane main judata rahata he
 The donations to SSSCT are exempt from income tax
 iske alaava unke prabhaavshaalee shraddhaluon ke bich vinimay se bhi paisa aata rahata he
 Baba's network proves him helpful in conducting business deals
 or iske evaj main ve sai baba ke kaaryakramon ke liye chanda dete hai
 SSSCT has been refusing to give details of its immense wealth keeping it in secrecy
 iskaa prabhaav itnaa zyada he ki tamaam asardaar hastiyon ke alaava raashtrapati or pradhanmantri tak ko satya sai baba ke darshan ke dauraan protocol kii andekhi kerani padati he
 The lack of transparency has perhaps led to speculation about the true size of their wealth empire and there have been apprehensions about misuse of money
 lekin esaxssiti ne parmarth ke kaaryon ke liye apane bhakton se milane vaale paison kaa hisaab kitaab puri saavdhaanee se rakhane kii vyavastha bana rakhi he
 The credit for this difficult work mainly goes to two people
 inamen se ek hai esaxssiti ke sachiv ke
 Chakravarthy, who has been the collector of Anantapur district (puttaparthi is a part of)
 unhone satya sai baba ke kaamon ke liye iees kii apni naukari se istipha de diya tha
 He started as the registrar of the Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning in 1981
 unke alaava duusare shaks hai es
 V
 giri
 He has also been an IAS officer of Andhra Pradesh cadre
 unhone 1998 main mukhya satarkta ayukta ke pad se istipha de diya tha
 Leaving a government job, he became the Chancellor of Sri Sathya Sai University and formed a network of educational institutions
 in donon ne sampurna gatividhiyon ko ek vishaal gaiyr sarkari sanghathan ke antargat nihit kar diya
 Sathya Sai University Campus at SSSCT Puttaparthi, 220-bed Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Sciences
 ja (jahaan baba ko biimaar hone ke baad tatkaal ilaaj ke liye le jaaya gaya tha), ek vishwa dharm sangrahalay chaitanya jyoti, ek taramandal, ek railway stesan, pahari ke kareeb bana ek stadium, ek sangeet mahavidhyalay, ek prashasnic bhawan, ek hawaldda or ek indoor stadium chalaata he
 In addition, the Trust runs a network of simple and specialized facilities in Bangalore, some other hospitals (including two eye hospitals) and some treatment centers
 yah anantpur jile ke 731 gaanvon ke liye ek jal pariyojna ke alaava kai peyajal pariyojnaon ko aarthik sahaayta de chukaa he or krishna nadi ke jal ko chennai laane ke liye condalerupundi nahar ke kinaaron ko thik karne main sahaayta de chukaa he
 Though Prashant Nilayam is the headquarters of Sathya Sai Baba in Puttaparthi, in summer he visits Vrindavan at White Field on the outskirts of Bangalore and Sai Shruti Ashram at Kodaikanal
 iske alaava duniya bhar main kareeb 1,300 satya sai baba centre hai jo skool, swasthya va saanskrithik centre chalaate hai
 Sathya Sai Baba's Educare program has opened schools in 33 countries
 unka ek digital radio network bhi he- radio sai global haaramani
 The Sathya Sai Network will use all these centers as his legacy to propagate Baba's teachings

 Apart from Anjaneyulu, it has institutionalized all these activities with the help of big leaders and bureaucrats

 He has about 200 relatives who have opened restaurants and lodges in Puttaparthi or become professionals on the strength of his influence

 ratnakar ko pichley saal esaxssiti kaa sadsy bana diya gaya, lekin unke haath main kisi tarah kii takat nahin di gai he
 It is expected that after Baba leaves, some members of his family will try to expose the failure of the institutions
 is bare main esaxssiti ke paas bachaav majboot nahin he
 Perhaps he will have to accept a generational change in management
 matbhed ubhar sakate hai lekin ummid kii ja rahi he ki unhen hal kar liya jayega kyonki sabhi sambandhit logon ko lag rahaa he ki andhra pradesh sarkaar 1959 ke hindu dharm evam paropkaaree nidhi kanoon kaa sahaara lekar iskaa adhigrahan kar legi
 Devotees of Sathya Sai Baba have deep feelings of superstition and devotion towards them
 pichley saat dashakon main yah itani gahari ho chuki he ki jo bhi un par andeh karata he, use dutkaar diya jaataa he
 This is the reason why his devotees — after Sai Baba's demise in 96 years — will wait for his successor
 baba kii bhavishyavaanee ke anusaar, unka uttaradhikari 2030 main karnataka ke mandya jile main gunaparthi gaanv se aayega, isiilie puttaparthi main unki gambhir beemaari se ghabrahat failane ke baad aam jivan jaldi hi saamaanya ho gaya
 If the Trust adopts the path of collective leadership, it will hardly be difficult to fulfill the goals set by Baba
 trust ke paas paise or saadhan kii kami nahin he
 The mess can only happen when the vested interests of the people in management are above the public interest
 agar sthiti niyantran se baahar hui to andhra pradesh sarkaar ko majabuuran aage aana padegaa

 On the occasion of his campaign here on Saturday, Romney said in a key speech related to economic policy, 'the problem he inherited was not only that but what he did deepened the inherited problem
 ’ unhone kaha ‘raashtrapati obama baar-baar hamen yaad dilaate hai ki unhen viraasat main sankatagrast arthvyavastha mili
 But he inherited not only a troubled economy but also the greatest country in the history of the earth
 unhen aaj tak ke itihaas kaa sabase utpaadak or navonmeshi raashtra bhi mila
 He also inherited the world's largest economy
 ’unhone kaha ki obama ne satta sanbhali to unhen viraasat main kharaab halaat mili or uske baad unhone halaat or bigaade
 He said 'president Obama has not cured our economy despite whatever he has inherited
 vah swasthya or saamaajik suraksha ko nahin bachaa paye
 He did not curb spending and borrowing
 unhone hamen ikattha karne ke liye koi vishesh kadam nahin uthaaya
 Neither did he take any step against China's trade policies nor fulfill the promise of improving our relations with Muslim countries where anti-american campaigns are on the rise
 ’romany ne aarope lagaaya ki obama ne sirf chaar saal kii avadhi main kareeb 6,000 arab dollar kaa rin liya or yah inase purv america raashtrapatiyon dwaara liye gaye kul rin ke baraabar he, The tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) has asked the Foreign Office to invite Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Pakistan for Imran Khan's swearing-in ceremony

 The PTI, led by Imran (65), has emerged as the single largest party in the elections for the National Assembly on 25th of this month and can form the government with the support of its allies and independents
 pitiai pramukh ne somvaar ko kaha tha ki vah 11 agast ko pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lenge
 PTI spokesperson Fawad Chaudhary was quoted as saying in The Dawn reports that the party has asked the Foreign Office whether in view of the short time, many other foreign dignitaries including Modi could be invited to the oath-taking ceremony
 
 choudhary ne kaha ki party videsh karyaalay ke jawaab kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 Modimodi will work to start a new chapter
 On Monday, Imran called and congratulated his party's victory in the general elections and hoped that Pakistan and India would work to start a new chapter in bilateral relations
 imran ne shubhakamanaayen dene ke liye modi kaa shukriya adaa kiya or is baat par jor diya ki baatcheet ke jariye vivaad sulajhaaye jane chahie
 Speaking to the media outside the Supreme Court, Chaudhary said that celebrities like Bollywood star Aamir Khan, cricketer Kapil Dev and Sunil Gavaskar have been invited to the swearing-in ceremony on behalf of the party

 First the miscreants looted 22 thousand rupees from Rudal and Rambhu and then attacked them with knives
 is hamale main rudal kii maukey par hi maut ho gai jabaki rambhu ghayal ho gaya
 After committing this robbery, the miscreants looted an unidentified passenger in a patna-gaya riding train parked in the same yard and killed him in protest

 balaatkaar peediton ko insaaf or madad dilaane ke liye yun to sarkaar or kanoon donon hi naye nayi skim or yojanaayen shuru kar dete hai
 But the ground truth is that they only prove to be a lewd joke in the name of schemes which further increases the pain of rape victim
 aparaadh yaa jyaadati ke shikaar peediton ko muaavje ke liye sarkaar ne legal sarvice athurity to bana di
 But this year only four victims could get compensation of 12 lakhs whereas 635 cases of rape were registered this year
 legal sarvice athurity rape, tezaab, apharan or bal utpeedan ke shikaron ke liye banaai gai
 The government also fixed an amount of 15 crores for this scheme
 lekin ye rakam peediton tak nahin pahunch paa rahi
 One of the major reasons for not getting compensation is that the authority asks for the home address of the women for compensation while many of the victims are homeless
 is bare main legal sarvice athurity se koi bhi kuch bhi bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 The Women's Commission is also angry with the authority's attitude
 adhyaksh, dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh barkhaa singh ne kaha, 'pehle zyada acchhee vyavstha thi
 He used to get some money for his treatment
 'jaahir he peediton ko muaavja milanaa or mushkil ho gaya he

 The ministry says that there was no pressure on the director to resign

 Shivgaonkar still had a tenure of more than two years
 gauratlab he ki jin paristhitiyon main shivaganvkar ne apane pad se tyaag patr diya, usamen aarope he ki maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay un par dabaav daal rahaa tha
 Shivgaonkar sent his resignation letter to IIT Board Chairman Vijay P
 Bhatkar on Friday night
 istife kii vajah ke taur par unhone ‘nijee kaaran’ bataaya he
 Shivgaonkar said on Sunday that he resigned after a controversy arose
 is vivaad main purv cricketer sachin tendulkar ko bhi ghasita gaya he
 On the other hand, the Ministry of Human Resource Development has denied the allegations of coercion
 aarope hai ki shivaganvkar ne tab istipha de diya jab unhone maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay kii kathith taur par do maangon ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 These demands were allegedly given to Tendulkar to open his cricket academy in the grounds of IIT Delhi and pay nearly Rs 70 lakhs to former IIT Delhi faculty and now BJP leader Subramanian Swamy as his outstanding salary between 1972 and 1981

 The ministry said in a statement that the news was 'factually incorrect' stating that Shivgaonkar resigned in protest against the pressure
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki mudde main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ko anaavashyak ghasita ja rahaa he, jahaan mantralay ne koi nirdesh nahin jari kiya he
 The ministry said, "neither a request has come from Sachin Tendulkar to run the IIT ground for running a cricket academy nor has the HRD ministry given any direction to give it
 'bayaan main kaha gaya he, 'maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne na to subrahmanyam swami ke anurodh ko iaiti dilli ke paas bheja he or na hi swami ko bakaae kaa bhugtan karne ke liye koi nirdesh diya gaya he
 The opinion of the dopt and the Ministry of Finance has been sought on this
 'twitor par sachin ne rakhaa pakshavivaad main apana naam ghasite jane par tendulkar ne bhi twitor ke jariye apni vyathaa jaahir kii he
 He said, 'I am surprised to read these news that IIT Delhi has asked for some land for the academy in my name
 maine na to kisi academy kii yojana banaai he or na hi kisi uddeshy ke liye main koi jameen chahta hum
 In another tweet, Sachin said, 'before publishing such a hypothetical thing using my name, i should check the basic facts
 'sarkaar or nideshak mandal ke bich he batswami ne bhi apane bakaae ke mudde ko shivaganvkar ke istife se jode jane par hairat jataai he
 He said that the matter is between the government and the board of directors
 unhone kaha, 'nideshak tasviir main kahin se bhi nahin aate
 Swamy alleged that the resignation was not to ask the HRD Ministry to allegedly calculate his dues but to set up the campus of IIT Delhi in Mauritius
 swami ne kaha, 'tathy ko chhipaane ke liye jiskaa matlab tha ki unke nideshak kaa pad nishchit taur par janaa tha, unhone iskaa rajnatik phayda uthaane kaa prayaas kiya
 The Ministry of Human Resource Development said in a statement, "the Chairman of IIT Delhi has sent the resignation letter of the Director on the evening of 26 December to follow the due process for the decision of the employer authority
 istipha sirf niyokta praadhikaar sweekaar kar saktaa he
 The ministry said it would go to the President for his approval, as he is a visitor to IIT Delhi

 Former Delhi Chief Minister and 'AAP' leader Arvind Kejriwal said that it is very sad that Shivgaonkar had to resign
