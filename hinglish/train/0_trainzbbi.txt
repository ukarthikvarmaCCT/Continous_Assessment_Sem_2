 After the martyrdom of four soldiers in Pakistan's firing in Poonch in Jammu and Kashmir, the voice of the retort is getting louder
 sarkaar or sena ne ection kii baat kahi bhi he
 But the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has gone a step ahead of the answer and demanded war
 vihip ke antarrashtriya adhyaksh praveen togadiya ne kaha he ki bharat shoorveeron kaa desh he
 He said, 'our Army, Airforce, Navy, CISF, BSF, Police, Home Guards are all engaged in the security of the country day and night and are giving their martyrdom every day
 togadiya ne kaha ki pakistan lagaataar bharat par hamale kar rahaa he, har din jawan mar rahe hai
 In such a situation, the time to embrace Pakistan is over now
 sargical strike nahin, sidhaa yudhrajnneetik dalon ke alaava kai morchon se ek baar phir pakistan ke khilaaf sargical strike kii maang uth rahi hai

 Togadia also said, 'many families have lost their relatives in gaining independence and in border defense

 Nobody wants war, but Pakistan is constantly attacking India

 Enough to embrace Pakistanis

 Further, Togadia also said that patriotism and national defense are not just about raising slogans, giving speeches, hoisting flags
 ab sarkaar pakistan se yuddh kare, puraa desh uske saath khadaa rahegaa
 His elder son Tej Pratap Yadav, who is going to meet RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav on his way to Ranchi, deteriorated in his health
 iske baad jahanabad main rukkar unhone apana chekup karaayaa
 The doctor examined and told that due to depression, blood pressure (BP) has reduced
 bataa den ki lalu se milane ke liye tejpratap yadav somvaar ko ranchi ravaanaa hue the
 Lalu Prasad Yadav is undergoing treatment at the Rims of Ranchi, but his sudden health deteriorated on the way
 iske baad tej pratap ne jahanabad main rukkar doctor ko dikhaaya
 Before leaving for Ranchi on Monday, Tej Pratap Yadav said that he was not interested in contesting the Lok Sabha elections and did not want to contest in 2019
 chhapra loksabhaa seat lalu parivaar kii paramparaagat seat rahi he
 However, when Lalu Prasad Yadav was convicted in the fodder scam, when Rabri Devi contested the last election from Chapra, she lost from there
 darasal loksabhaa chunaav najadik aate hi ab is baat ko lekar lagaataar kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki chhapra se chunaav koun ladega
 When Aishwarya Rai was married to Tej Pratap Yadav, her name also rose for this seat, but one, she was not yet 25 years old, and now there is no scope left after the divorce case is moved in court
 kayaas is baat ke bhi the ki lalu yadav ke samadhi or chandrika raay bhi chhapra se chunaav ladane ke icchhuk the
 It is believed that there was a reason for the rift between Tej Pratap and Aishwarya
 baharhaal tejpratap yadav ne ravivaar ko achaanak argedy daftaar ja kar phir se raajnneeti main sakriy hone kaa elaan kar diya
 On Monday, he left for Ranchi to meet his father on the same issue
 mana ja rahaa he ki tejpratap yadav lalu yadav se kahenge unhen party main jagah di jaae
 Also, Tej Pratap can ask for help in getting a divorce from his father
 tej pratap ne kaha ki vah pitaaji se milane ja rahe hai or ve bihar main pehle jaisi politics karenge
 On Sunday, Tej Pratap Yadav said that he has brought a boon from Vrindavan and will launch Sudarshan Chakra on opponents in Kurukshetra in Bihar
 haalanki ravivaar ko patna ke argedy karyaalay pahunche tejpratap ne kaha tha ki vah loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaariyon main koi kor kasar nahin chodenge
 After this, his statement has come on Monday
 narendra modi sarkaar kaa pehla bajet july main kathin aarthik daur main pesh hoga
 Still the expectations are unmatched
 varsh 2013-14 main aarthik vruddhi dar ummid se thodi kam 4
 Was 7 percent
 khudara jinson main mahangaai kii dar 8
 5 per cent, which has improved from earlier but still so much that the Reserve Bank of India is obliged to keep the interest rates under check
 aarthik vruddhi ko tej karne yaa mahangaai par kaabo paane ko koi shortkat bhi nahin he
 The budget alone cannot deal with both through policies
 phir bhi bajet ko lekar baari gahamagahami he kyonki ise modi sarkaar ke arthvyavastha sudhaarney ke apane vaade par kadam badhaane kaa pehla mauka mana ja rahaa he
 Many want a return to a period of financial sanctity
 haalanki 2013-14 main sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) ke 4
 The fiscal deficit of 5 per cent does not look bad
 to, phir ise 2014-15 main 4
 1 per cent and 3 in 2015-16
 6 fisadi or uske agle varsh 3 fisadi tak laane ke lakshya par tike rahane main kya buraai he? tark yah bhi he ki 4
 The 5 per cent level does not take into account planning or capital investment reductions, with deferred spending on 2014-15
 isliye, agar jidipi ke anupaat main ghate ko kam karke aarthik vruddhi ko shah dene kaa lakshya he to kya hamen 2014-15 main aankh moond kar 4
 What should be the target of 1 percent? It is one thing to return to the Financial Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 and make a path keeping it in mind, but to implement it only in 2014-15
 samasya sirf rajkoshiya ghate kii nahin he, balki rajasav ghaataa or sarkari kharch tathaa rajasav main talmail kaa bhi maamla vikat he
 The major items of revenue expenditure are interest payments, subsidies, salaries, pensions, defense spending as well as state grants from which capital assets are created
 sabsidi katautee ko lekar hamaara najariya chaahe jo ho, yah bipiel pariwaron kii pahchaan ke bare main rajyon se baatcheet or sahmati ke bina karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Of course, there is scope for reducing wasteful and unproductive government spending
 lekin ise 2014-15 main hi karne kii ummid karnaa avyaavhaarik he
 Now let's talk about tax revenue
 naram kii gai pratyaksh kar samhita ab pehle jaisi nahin rahi
 And before bringing the Goods and Services Tax regime, many issues need to be dealt with
 masalan, kis seva yaa maal ke maamle main chhot di jaae, dohare daron kii vishesh vyavastha kya hogi, stamp duty, chungi kar tathaa sharaab, petroleum utpaadon, tambaakoo par lagane vaale karon kaa kya hoga, or rajyon ko rajasav muaavje kaa kya aadhaar hoga
 Therefore, more and more intentions can only be indicated
 ham bajet main achaanak kar sudhaaron kii ummid kaise kar sakate hai? sahi he ki kar riyaayaton se jidipi kii 5
 3% of the amount goes to waste but there is no agreement to remove it
 isliye hamen kuch tarksangat or santulit vyavastha kii hi ummid kerani chahie
 But we must hope to do away with the provisions that have come into force from the previous dates and get rid of the tax lawsuits
 bazaar or bahari paryvekshak nijeekaran ko lekar utaavle hai
 There is also talk of reducing the capital stake in public sector banks to invest that money in strengthening the banks
 is maamle main us bahes ko thodaa alag rakhen ki kya parisampattiyon ko bechakar rajasav kharch main ghate kii bharpai kii jaani chahie
 Since the goal is to restructure, should we expect privatization of psus? In fact, the government has limited freedom to make major reforms both in terms of revenue and expenditure
 upie-2 sarkaar kaa vittiya prabandhan itnaa acha isliye nahin rahaa kyonki aarthik vruddhi ke uske akalan galat ho gaye
 So, it should be interesting to see the budget figures on this front
 2014-15 main vaastavik vruddhi 5
 It is not expected to be more than 5 percent
 isliye jidipi main 12
 Estimates of growth of more than 5 per cent are meaningless while 14–14 in multiple budgets
 5 fisadi vruddhi kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya
 This means that if gross tax revenue increases, suppose that 17
 5 fisadi se adhik kaa lakshya rakhaa jaataa he to akalan ke aankadon, unamem taratamyata or kar ke vibhinn madon ke byore jaanchane kii darkaar he
 In many announcements, apart from the finance ministry, other ministries and states are linked at the implementation level
 phir bhi ham nitigat ghoshnaaon ke saath anupoorak bajet laate rahe hai
 For this reason, many finance ministers, including the NDA-1 era, remained brave in promises but stuck on the ground
 hamen endie-2 ke daur main mantralayon ke bich behatar talmail or kriyanvayan kii ummid to kerani hi chahie
 In the absence of synergy, the Cabinet Committee on Investment has been stagnant during the UPA-2 era, now it shows improvement
 to, 2014-15 ke bajet main ham kisi nitigat ghoshnaaon kii ummid kar sakate hai? ye pratyaksh videshi nivesh, prakriyaaon, bijli, skills, shiksha, awaas, parivahan, shaharikaran, swasthya, ity, or kanoon-vyavastha se sambandhit ho sakati hai
 Most of them belong to the states
 isliye mahatvapurn yah nahin hoga ki kisi yojanaon kii ghoshnaa hui or unke liye bajet main kya praavdhaan kiye gaye, balki yah jaananaa ahm hoga ki rajyon ko sudhaaron par amal ke liye kya protsaahan die gaye or vikendrikaran ke liye kya kiya gaya
 Cases of amendment of MNREGA, Food Security Act, and Land Acquisition Act may be important
 har bajet main packaging kaa bhi apana mahatv he
 Both matters will be important for the first budget of Modi government

 It is said that if you have high expectations from someone, then later disappointment is at hand
 aisa bahut si baar hua hoga jab aapane kisi insaan or duusari cheez ke bare main badi-badi baaten sochi hongi or aapaki ummiido or utsaah main ijapha hua hoga, lekin baad main jo jaisaa sochaa tha wo vaisaa na niklaa ho to aap niraash bhi hue honge
 i am in a similar situation after watching the film Dream Girl
 jab se maine ye film dekhi he, tab se mere man main yahi baat aa rahi he ki yaar film thik thi, par majaa nahin aayaa
 Let me also explain why the fun did not come - because there are many shortcomings in the film
 film ke promo or trailor dekhakar jo ummiden ham sabhi ne baandhi hai, wo puri hone ke chance thode kam hi hai
 Talking about the story, this is about our Karamveer (ayushmann Khurrana), who plays characters like Sita and Draupadi in a theater play
 karam ladki kii aawaaj nikaal saktaa he or isliye use play main ladakiyon ke kirdaar die jate hai
 And there is a lot of fame in the city by the name of brother brother Sita Maiya
 karam kii jaruratein uski selary se badi hai or naukari use mil nahin rahi
 So he uses his talent and starts working in the call center by becoming 'pooja'
 karam kol centre main puja banakar baaten karnaa shuru karata he to logon ko uski baaten itani pasand aa jaati hai ki wo 'puja' ke pyaar main padane lagate hai
 Now Pooja does not have callers like Aashiq, who can give her life to get her, leave her wife and even change her religion

 iske baad entry hoti he maahi (nushrat bharucha) kii, jise wo dil de baithta he
 Karam's life begins to set in that it starts getting tattered
 vahi tante jo ham sabhi kii jindagi main kabhi naa kabhi jarur hue hai yani uski profeshnal life kaa uski personal life main ghusna or phir uthal-puthal machana
 This is where the whole drama begins
 ab karte hai asli baat or wo he film kaa screenple
 Looking at the film, it seems that its screenplay is inspired by some old films
 film kii dikkat ye he ki ye jo sikh aapako detii he agle hi pal use khud hi khaarij kar detii he
 While on one hand it is being said that a girl should not judge according to her profession, while on the other hand, Pooja is being described as a loose character everywhere
 iske alaava hamen abhi tak filmon main ladki ko impress karne kaa behatar tarika dekhne ko kyon nahin mil rahaa ye baat meri samaj se pare he
 Karam falls in love with Mahi at first sight but he chases her to get her
 phir jab uski chori pakadi jaati he to maahi bhi uske pyaar main pad jaati he
 Amazing! This is a comedy film, but you will feel many times that it is trying to make you laugh forcefully
 lekin iskaa matlab ye nahin he ki film main badhiya jokes yaa sikvence nahin hai
 The plus point of the film is the acting done in it
 ayushmaan khurana film ke hero hai or agar main kahuun ki ye ayushmaan khurana kaa sho he to galat nahin hoga
 The catch that Ayushmann has created with his character and voice is praiseworthy
 ye film ek or udhaaharan he ki ayushmaan kitne talented artist hai
 His acting, comedy, dance are all good in the film
 karam (ayushmaan) ke pita bane anu kapur kaa kaam acha he or bahut si jagah wo limlite ayushmaan se chin le jate hai
 Abhishek Banerjee is very right in his character and would have been awesome if he had been given a bit more screen time
 raaj bhansaali kaa kirdaar mjedaar hai or vijay raaj hameshaa kii tarah kamaal hai
 Manjot Singh is happy to see him do a good job again after the fuss
 nushrat bharuchaa ko bahut kuch karne ko mila nahin, lekin jitna mila unhone nibhaa liya
 Apart from this, the work of the other supporting actors seen in the film is also good
 film ke aise bahut se joke hai, jo actors kii badhiya acting or delivery ke chalate aapako hansaa paae hai
 The slow-start movie Dream Girl sometimes catches its pace and sometimes slows down
 ye kaha to gaya tha ki mathura main set he lekin sahi main isaki kahani kahaan set he ye samajhane main aapako mushkil jarur hogi
 Confusion is caused by seeing the UP board and the Haryana Police's barigade
 haa, iske gane achche hai
 While the telephone song of the heart makes your mind home, the choreography of Radhe Radhe is quite good
 ye film to antertaning hai, lekin iskaa clymex aapako bilkul khush nahin karata
 There was a lot of effort to create turmoil in the climax but alas it was a failure
 is film main feel kii kami he

 It is not for those who think a lot
 film kii kamiyaan nazarandaaj karne ke hisaab se bahut zyada hai, jo ise hamaari soch se alag banaati he
 In the Congress General Assembly, Haryana Party leader Randeep Surjewala has attacked the Modi government on the issue of farmers and the Swaminathan Committee
 surajevaala ne kaha ki modi sarkaar kisaanon ko unka haq nahin de rahi or swaminathan cameti ko jumalanathan cameti se riples kar diya he
 He said, 'I would like to ask the Modi government that when Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, Vijay Mallya and Jatin Mehta ran away with the money of the country, did it not affect the market
 kya sirf bazaar par tabhi asar padataa he, jab kisaan nunatam samarthan mulya maangate hai
 Surjewala said that if anyone has betrayed the farmers of the country, then it is the present Modi government of the country
 narendra modi ne kiya krishi unnati meley kaa udghaatanpradhanmantri narendra modi ne shanivaar ko nai dilli main krishi unnati meley kii shuruyaat kii
 Along with this, he also laid the foundation stone for 25 Krishi Vigyan Kendras
 is maukey par piem modi ne kaarykram main nunatam samarthan mulya ke puure ganit ko samajhaayaa
 The Prime Minister explained the minimum support price arithmetic
 He said that the cost will be added for the minimum support price, the value of the labor of another worker, the cost of own cattle-machine or hired cattle or machine, the value of seed, all kinds Value of fertilizer, expenditure incurred on irrigation, land revenue given to the state government, interest paid above the working capital, given for the leased land Rent, and other expenses are included
 itnaa hi nahin kisaan ke dwaara khud or apane parivaar ke sadasyon dwaara die gaye shram ke yogadan kaa bhi mulya, utpaadan laagat main joda jayega
 'not only earning beekeeping, but also with humanity', the Prime Minister said that in this budget, the government has also announced that farmer-producing institutions will be exempted from income tax in the same way as cooperative societies
 aaj yahaan jin krishi vigyaan kendron ko puraskaar diya gaya he, unamem se kai madhumakhi paalan main bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 He said that beekeeping is not only related to earning but also with the whole of humanity
 unhone kaha ki vaigyanik oinstin ne bhi bataaya tha ki agar madhumakhi naa rahe to insaan ke liye dikkatein paidaa hongi
 Our government is also making meaningful efforts towards West to Wealth

 Tharoor said that in a country with a diverse and large population like India, it is difficult for the parliamentary system to be effective

 tharur ne kaha, ‘bhavishya main samvidhan ke vichaar ko adhik saidhantik tareeke se talashne ke liye 1930 main simon ayog banaaya gaya tha
 Clement Attlee, a member of that commission, wrote in his diary that he suggested to Indian nationalist leaders that the presidential system would be better
 unhone kaha ki netaaon ne dar bhari pratikriya di
 The Congress Lok Sabha member from Thiruvananthapuram said that it is not necessary that India should be grateful to the British for the heritage institutions in the country
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaari sarkaar kii shashan vyavastha aisi he jise ek chote dweep main banaaya gaya jisaki aabaadi aaj chah karod he or prayek saansad kareeb ek lakh logon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he

 samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke sangrakshak or purv mukhyamantri mulaayam singh yadav ne shanivaar ko kaha ki pakistan bharat se muqabla nahin kar saktaa hai, desh ko asal khatra pakistan se nahin china se hai
 Mulayam was addressing people on the occasion of the birth anniversary celebrations of SP leader and former MP Bhagwati Singh at the Chandrika Devi temple in Bakshi Ka Talab area on Saturday
 We are in conflict with the central government '
 samaaroh ke dauraan pakistan or china kii baat karte hue mulaayam ne kaha, 'main 20 saal se kah rahaa hum ki bharat ko pakistan se nahin china se khatra he, pakistan bharat kaa muqabla nahin kar saktaa or jahaan tak china kaa sawaal he, to ham sab ek he china ko lekar desh ko ek saath khadaa hona padegaa
 We are with the central government in any conflict with China '
 saath hi kaha ki 'china sikkim or bhutan par kabje kii sajeesh rach rahaa he vah bharat par hamale kii puri taiyaari kar chukaa hai'
 Mulayam asked the Center to be vigilant with China and said that the Central Government should call an all-party meeting on China
 kai baar is mudde ko uthaane ke baavjood centre sarkaar yah nahin bataa rahi ki china ke khilaaf bharat kya kadam uthaa rahaa hai'
 Talking about the Third Front government once formed at the Center, he said, "if we had become the Prime Minister at that time, then if the former Prime Minister had remained the same then what would have gone wrong"
 bhagwati singh kii tarif karte hue mulaayam ne kaha ki 'bhagwati singh samaajawaadee sant hai inhone kabhi kuch nahin maanga, kaaryakarta bhagwati singh se raajnneeti va samaaj seva seekhen'
 Talking about strengthening the SP, he said that all the people together should strengthen the Samajwadi Party

 The claim of AAP leaders can happen anytime in Punjab, said to the big reverser, Jat Singh Sidhu, a leader of height and neglected in the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab is constantly running political bets on the leaders and mlas who are angry with the Congress
 taaja ghatnakram main aam aadmi party ke punjab ke ko-president aman aroda ne navjot singh siddhu ko lekar kaha ki wo bhi apni hi party kii sarkaar kii nitiyon ke khilaaf hai
 He further said that Navjot Singh Sidhu's stature is that if any new political equation is formed in future, then Navjot Singh Sidhu should reach a higher position according to his political stature
 aman aroda kaa ishaara mukhyamantri kii kursi par tha kyonki aman aroda lagaataar yah koshish kar rahe hai ki congress ke jo vidhayak apni hi sarkaar main naa sune jane or kaam naa ho paane ke kaaran captain amarinder singh se naaraaz chal rahe hai unhen apane paksh main laayaa ja sake
 Aman Arora has also announced that many angry Congress mlas are in constant contact with him and in the coming days there can be a big upswing in the politics of Punjab
 iske saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki congress se naaraaz chal rahe vidhayakon ko bhi congress se alag hokar punjab main aam aadmi party ke saath milakar sarkaar banani chahie taaki janata se kiye gaye vaadon ko wo sarkaar ke madhyam se puraa kar saken or navjot singh siddhu jo is vakt punjab sarkaar main puri tarah se sidline kar die gaye hai unhen bhi is sarkaar kaa hissaa bananaa chahie
 At the same time, another MLA of Aam Aadmi Party Kulatar Singh Sandhwa said that Congress mlas whose work is not being done in Punjab in their own government, they should look at the functioning of the government of Arvind Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi and Aam Aadmi Party Together, form a government in Punjab
 dilli kii tarah hi punjab main bhi ye sarkaar bijli, pani or skulon jaise muddon par shandaar kaam karke dikhaaegi
 Kultar Singh Sandhwa said that many mlas of Punjab Congress are impressed by Arvind Kejriwal's work done in Delhi government and are in touch with Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab
 is mudde par congress ke netaaon ne aman aroda ke daawey ko majaak main uda diya or kaha ki pehle punjab main aam aadmi party apni andruni tut ko to sambhaal le or unase jo lagaataar unke vidhayak chhitak rahe hai un par dhyaan den
 After that, talk with angry Congress mlas to form a government together
 punjab main koi bhi vidhayak apni sarkaar se naaraaz nahin he
 The family members keep on talking lightly and the utensils keep ringing
 is puure maamle paranvjot singh siddhuka naam uthaae jane or navjot cor siddhu ke congress ke naaraaz chal rahe vidhayakon ke saath sampark hone ke maamle par akali dal ke netaa bikram singh majithia ne kaha ki thoko tali
 Navjot Singh Sidhu has a political history that he cannot survive in any political party beyond 2 years and in such a situation, he will now be different from the Congress and that is why he is constantly trying to create a new political platform for himself
 Huh
 majithia ne kaha ki yah baat bilkul sahi he ki punjab kii congress sarkaar main unke apane hi vidhayakon kii ek nahin chalati or unki naa to suni jaati he or naa hi unke ilaakon ke kaam kiye jate hai
 For this reason many mlas are angry with their government but these angry mlas cannot do anything by wishing and if any MLA who is against the policies of the government and against corruption and mining and other mafia spread in Punjab, then if he If you want, you can stand with the Akali Dal
 yah baat bilkul sahi he ki punjab ke kai congress vidhayak apni sarkaar main apni naa sune jane, apane ilaakon ke kaam naa hone ke kaaran captain amarinder singh or pradesh kii afasarshahi se behad hi naaraaz hai or khulkar apni naaraazgi jaahir bhi kar chuke hai
 Seeing the displeasure of these mlas, now the Aam Aadmi Party and the Akali Dal have started hurling angry Congress mlas

 ' Harbhajan Singh, defending captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who was under attack from critics, said on Wednesday that a single match loss should not criticize the captain who led the team to become the world champion
 dhoni ne england ke khilaaf mumbai main khele gaye duusare test match main terning wicket taiyaar karavaaya tha lekin unka yah daanv ulta pad gaya tathaa bharat ko das wicket se karaari haar jhelni padi
 Harbhajan, who came to his cricket academy here with fellow player Suresh Raina, said that it is unfair to criticize Dhoni for this
 harbhajan ne patrakaron se kaha, ‘‘maichon main haar jeet lagi rahati he
 Losing in a match should not criticize players, especially captains like Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 ’’ He said, "we should not forget that Dhoni is the captain who made us world champions for the first time since 1983
 vah bharat ke behatar or saphaltam captainon main se hai
 Therefore, his ability to question a losing match and his criticism is not right
 ’’ Harbhajan claimed that the team would be able to make a comeback in the third Test match starting on 5 December in Kolkata
 unhone kaha, ‘‘kolkata main aglaa muqabla he
 We will win there
 logon ko yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki england ko ham bhi unki sarajameen par haraa chuke hai
 So if the team loses a match then it is not right to put the captain and the players in the box

 '' harbhajan ne daawa kiya ki team kolkata main 5 disambar se shuru hone vaale tisare test match main vaapasi karne main safal rahegi
 He said, "kolkata is the next match

 yah bayaan amit shah kaa he
 BJP national president Amit Shah has had a long interview in the Indian Express
 unke is daawey se yahi nishkarsh lagata he ki basapa or sapa kaa gathbandhan samaapt ho chukaa he
 This time the BSP is going to get zero again and the SP will be able to win only the leaders of its family
 2019 main amit shah ke is daawey par hansaa ja saktaa he lekin 2014 main upi ke prabharee ke taur par amit shah ne 73 siten jeet kar dikhaai thi
 All the pesky experts of UP politics were proved wrong
 kya is baar bhi amit shah tamaam dhurandharon ko galat sabit kar denge?isamen koi shaq nahin ki amit shah maujuuda daur ke sabhi dalon ke adhyakshon main kaaphi mehnatee hai
 Following the Code of Conduct, the figure of 100 rallies has been touched
 uske pehle bhi ve lagaataar reliyaan hi karte rahe hai
 No political journalist has analyzed Amit Shah's meetings
 kya unki sabhaaon main bhi log pradhanmantri kii tarah sunne ke liye daude-daude jate hai? aakhir 100 reliyaan koi yun hi nahin karata he
 Is Amit Shah really appealing to the audience? Becoming a popular leader among the people? Nobody talks about Amit Shah's attraction in his rallies and rallies
 agar log unhen sunne ke liye umad rahe hai to bilkul likhaa janaa chahie
 Amit Shah's claim about Uttar Pradesh is interesting and challenging
 upi ko amit shah ne apni prayogshaala main badal diya he
 Made like Gujarat or like anyone else, its analysis never showed in any article
 aakhir upi main amit shah ne aisa kya kiya he ki sapa or basapa ke ek ho jane ke baad bhi daawa kar rahe hai ki inke ek hone ke baad bhi bijepi ko 80 main se 73 yaa 74 siten aaengi
 However, when asked by Ravish Tiwari and Rajkamal Jha of the Express, what do they say about the two phases, we reply that we are winning 74 seats
 2014 ke baad desh main kai chunaav hue
 UP was the only election in which Amit Shah achieved more than the target
 2017 ke chunaav main bijepi ne 203 kaa naaraa diya tha magar party ko 300 se adhik siten aa gayi
 That is, Amit Shah was also not successful in evaluating his target and wave
 jitani siten aa rahi thim usase bhi kam paane kii soch rahe the
 For the second time in UP, Amit Shah achieved great success, so drink a glass of water before laughing at the claim for the third time
 kya vaaki aisa ho saktaa he ki akhilesh or mayawati kaa gathbandhan 0 se 6 par simat jaae
 Then Akhilesh and Mayawati should leave UP, go to Gujarat and do politics
 2015 main bihar ke liye bijepi ne mishan 185 rakhaa tha
 99 seats won
 vahaan jadyu, rajd or congress kii sarkaar bani
 Later, JD u and BJP government were formed
 2016 main bengal vidhansabha ke liye amit shah ne trinmul mukt bengal kaa naaraa diya tha
 The BJP had set a target of 150 seats out of 294 there
 3 siten ain
 The BJP had targeted Mission 150 for the Karnataka Legislative Assembly last year
 bijepi ko 104 siten ain
 Will not be called too bad but BJP could not form government
 congress or jades kii sarkaar bani
 The BJP also targeted Mission 150 in the Gujarat assembly elections
 vahaan bijepi ko 99 siten ain
 For the sixth time BJP succeeded in forming the government
 himachal pradesh main mishan 50 plus rakhaa tha
 44 seats were won and BJP government was formed
 goa ke chunaav main bijepi 13 siten jeet saki
 In 2012, there were 21 seats
 dobaaraa to sarkaar ban gai magar kai dalon ko milakar sarkaar banani padi
 In 2017, at an Odisha rally, Amit Shah claimed to win 120 seats in the 2019 assembly elections
 iskaa hisaab bhi samajhaayaa tha
 For this, the target is to have 36000 booths in the state
 har booth par 400 vot laana he
 With this they will overthrow Naveen Patnaik
 nattejey aane dijie
 This mission of Amit Shah will also be accounted for
 abhi khaarij karnaa thik nahin rahegaa
 Is the BJP going to the electoral fray by forming alliances with more than 40 parties, Amit Shah's success or failure? The BJP could not go to the polls on its own in 2019 after forming governments in 16 states
 tab bhi nahin ja saki jab uske paas sabase bade brands netaa hai
 Congress is also in the victory of BJP in Uttarakhand
 uske mantrimandal main congress se aae netaa bhi hai
 Amit Shah is a leader in maintaining dominance
 yah samajha janaa baaki he ki unki jeet lokapriyata kii jeet he yaa us ranneeti kii jiske bare main log kam jaanate hai
 Amit Shah seems invincible in his claims
 haav-bhav main bhi
 Even after this, under the strategy and direction of Amit Shah, BJP had to face defeat in Bihar, Delhi, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh
 5 hindi bhashi rajyon main mili haar kam badi nahin thi magar amit shah apane aatmavishvasi jawaab main use bhi nakaar jate hai
 Amit Shah has set Mission 400 target for 2019, which is lower than his fixed target in many states except UP
 upi ke liye 80 main se 74 kaa lakshya rakhaa he

 The play 'jab Shahar Hamara Sota Hai', written by Piyush Mishra published from Rajkamal Publication, is an accurate account of the causes of communal riots in this country
 meerut, saharanpur or mujffarnagar main sampradayik dangon kii kahani bhi piyush ke ‘shahar’ se milti julati he
 Piyush Mishra's adorned with the tone and stamina, i am sorry for not seeing this drama on stage, but it is also exciting to read it by taking it in the hands of the book
 piyush ke likhe doylog khaalish bhades he or yahi unke paatro kii takat bhi
 
 jaise, naatak ke ek drishy main tyaagi bolta he
 
 ‘ek haath padane kii der he cheenta

 You and these brother-in-law Karimpura have done a lot of torture here

 Only characters like Anta, Chinta, Ghunna, Ainwei can choose Piyush Mishra
 unke paatro main sab mardaana ho aisa nahin he
 Anvai is a girl who is as eager to fight as Anta and Chinta, but on the contrary, there are also characters like Tarana, Tabassum and Nishi who burn love and love lamps against violence on their hands
 piyush mishra, manoj vaajapeyi, ashish vidhyaarthee, gajraj raav or imtiyaaj ali naatak kii mukhya bhoomikaaon main he
 Apart from this, there are other characters who had the status of star in their time
 piyush mishra is naatak ke bare main likhte hai
 
 ‘shahar
 
 
 The word of two and a half letters was about Ishq
 ‘shahar
 
 
 'was about pigeons
 ‘shahar
 
 
 It was about the fragrance of roses, the fluttering of heron, the chirping of the cuckoo and the dancing of the peacock
 ‘shahar
 
 
 It was about the first kiss of youth
 or ‘shahar
 
 
 'I was in love with' i love you ', a voice echoing in the past
 mandi house or dilli kii rangashaalaon main jab yah naatak khelaa ja rahaa tha, to puure desh main sampradayawad ne dhuni ramai hui thi

 sharma ke shabdon main kaha jaye to yah ek musical drama he
 It has 13 songs
 kabutar kaa gaanaa he
 It is the song of the night
 police waalon kaa gaanaa he or america kaa bhi gaanaa he
 When Piyush Mishra's characters were created, the period of liberalization was about to begin
 lekin tab bhi unke paatr america jane kii khwaahish paale hue the
 Just like today's high-degree professionals
 
 These characters do not belong anywhere else, they belong to this society
 jo jubaan kholte hai to kuch yun farmaate hai
 i want to go to America, i want to go to America, i want to go to America, i want to go to America
 
 This is the song of those laundries who want to go to America
 lekin un kabutaron kaa gaanaa bhi he jo gharounde basaate hai
 Light will be a bright city, in which we and you will build houses, both will be from pigeon, in which there will be no fear of hawks
 
 
 
 There will also be delicate walls of velvet, there will also be outdoor seating in the corners, the door frame will also be of silk, wrapped with sandalwood, yes it will also be worn
 
 
 chaandi ke taron se raaten bunenge tochamakili hogi saharujala hi ujala shahar hoga
 
 2012 main piyush mishra ne ise ek televijan channel ke kaarykram main gaaya bhi tha, is gane ko padhate-gaate-sunate hue ‘nam ankhen mundakar kisi kaa haath pakadakar diwaar se tikne kii ichha hoti he
 There is a desire to go to the Dargah of Hazrat Nizamuddin
 ’tabhi to jab shahar hamaara sota he ke kabutaron main se ek 'abhas' apane chachaa se kahata he, ‘agar kisi ko sirf choubees ghante ke liye taraana (mohabbat / ishk) mil jaae to kisi or cheez kii khwaahish karne kii jarurat nahin rahati
 But contrary to the feeling, Aslam tells Tabassum of his love
 
 
 ‘
 
 
 And i am always the one
 wo ek hameshaa ‘main’ hua karun jiske abba kii dukaan petrol chhidakkar jala di gai? wo ek hameshaa ‘main’ hua karun jisko kisi bhi sadak par chalate hue ghuspaithiya kahkar thook diya jaataa he? wo ek hameshaa ‘main’ hua karun jisko isi mulk main janm lene ke baavjood wo haq hasil nahin saktaa, jo in logon ko he?’yah sachai he or piyush mishra ne ise bakhubi bayaan kiya he
 For those who know Piyush Mishra only through his songs and film characters, this book also tells a lot about Piyush Mishra
 kitaab ke cover se shuruaati pannon ke rup main judaa ‘lekhak kii ore se’ likhaa gaya chah pej ko note is kitaab ke vajan ko kai guna badha detaa he
 Piyush Mishra and Manoj Bajpayee's Abhiyan This sentence may not be possible to see this drama, but through it Piyush Mishra and his city can be known

 Party spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said here, "the Prime Minister must remember the fact that the government's unwilling attitude of not accepting the JPC demand has created a deadlock in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha
 unhone kaha, ‘pradhanmantri desh ke baahar sansad main bane gatirodh par bol rahe hai
 But while living in Delhi, he made no effort to resolve the matter
 prayaas to dur unhone is bare main munh tak nahin kholaa
 Holding the UPA government responsible for corruption cases, the BJP spokesperson said, "the government is collectively responsible for all the corruption cases, including twog spectrum, Commonwealth Games and Adarsh housing Society, because it is Singh's Council of Ministers
" Only the members of which have been found to be involved in these cases
 ’shahanwaaz ne kaha, vipaksh sansad ko sugam tareeke se chalaanaa chahta he, lekin pradhanmantri ne gatirodh ke kaarnon ko dur karne main koi yogadan nahin kiya
 Singh, responding to questions from reporters during his visit to Berlin, reacted to the deadlock in Parliament, saying that he was concerned about India's parliamentary system as the entire winter session of Parliament was an uproar over the 2G spectrum issue
 is par bhaajapa pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘pehali baat pradhanmantri ko yah yaad rakhni chahie ki unki sarkaar ke ziddee or anhakaari ravaiye ke kaaran desh ke loktantr ko khatra he
 The whole country is seeing that the Prime Minister did nothing to break the deadlock
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘‘duusari baat yah ki bhartiya loktantr majboot tha, majboot he or majboot rahegaa
 Like the Emergency, the responsibility of the opposition is to save democracy
 loktantr ko majboot banane ke liye hi vipaksh sansad main bhrashtachar ke muddon ko uthaa rahaa he
 Shahnawaz alleged that due to the weakness of the Singh government, so many big corruption cases occurred during his tenure
 unhone kaha, ‘manmohan sarkaar kii chhavi kharaab hui he
 We would like to remind the government once again that the opposition is united on the issue of JPC and till the government agrees to it we will continue to raise it within Parliament and outside Parliament

 Amid differences in the grand alliance over seat sharing for the by-elections to be held in Bihar on October 21, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Sunday made it clear that there is no contradiction in the secular alliance and it is unbreakable
 tejasvi ne bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko ‘girggit kii tarah rang badalane vaala' bhi bataaya or bhavishya main dharmanirpeksh gathbandhan main unke lautne kii kisi sambhaavna se inkaar kiya
 The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader, in an interview to PTI language, attacked Nitish, saying that he helped the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the BJP to expand their base and put secular and socialist politics at risk
 yah puche jane par ki agle saal hone vaale bihar vidhansabha chunaav se pehle kya nitish kumaar ke mahagathbandhan main lautne kii sambhaavna he, tejasvi ne kaha ki samaveshi raajnneeti ke liye dharmanirpekshata evam samaajwaad ek jeevanaparyant patibaddhta he or nitish ne iskaa sadaa ke liye tyaag kar diya he
 The RJD leader said, "he (nitish) not only betrayed us but also discarded the core principles on which secular-inclusive politics rests
" keval ham nahin balki ve log bhi jo pragatisheel raajnneeti main yakeen rakhte hai, ve girggit jaise rang badalane vaale vyakti ko apnaane ko anicchhuk hai
 The Leader of Opposition in the Bihar Legislative Assembly criticized the BJP-JDU coalition government's response to the recent floods in the state, saying that the entire state helplessly saw the 'insensitivity' of the Nitish Kumar-led government and that they were polling booths Will answer it purv up mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘baadh, jalajmav, chamaki bukhaar (eies)se hone vaali mautein, mujffarpur balika grih cond koi prakritik aapadaa nahin hai, balki bhrashtachar ke jariye sarkaar nirmit aapadaaen hai
 Tejashwi claimed that Bihar is in a 'grave crisis' and people are angry over what happened in the Muzaffarpur girls' home, deaths due to chilly fever and indifferent attitude of the state government during the floods
 mahagathbandhan main shaamil partiyon ke bich seat bantwaare ko lekar asahmati ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha, ‘‘ise pariprekshya ke saath samajhnaa chahie
 These by-elections are being held in only five assembly seats and the tenure of the current assembly is barely 10 months
 ''rajya main 21 oktober ko samastipur loksabhaa seat ke alaava darunda, nathanagar, simari bakhtiyarpur, kishanganj or belhar vidhansabha siton par upachunaav hone ja rahaa he
 It is worth mentioning that former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha (secular) fielded its candidate against RJD in Nathnagar and Mukesh Sahni-led Vikas Insaan Party (VIP) nominated its candidate for Simri Bakhtiyarpur seat of the Mahagathbandhan constituents
 The differences between them have come to light
 tejasvi ne kaha ki ‘ham' or viipi jaise gathbandhan saajhedaar hamaare bade uddeshyon ko lekar hamaare saath hai or in upachunaavon kaa hamaare gathbandhan par koi asar nahin padegaa
 He said that all the parties involved in the grand alliance are well aware of the anti-people policies of the central and state governments and they will remain united in the interest of the people
 unhone kaha ki bihar main jamini str par bhaajapa-jadyu sarkaar ke khilaaf rosh he or ve 23 may ke aamchunaav nateezon ko doharaa nahin paaenge
 The grand alliance includes RJD, Congress, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) led by former Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha, HAM, Sharad Yadav and vips
 tejasvi ne aarope lagaaya ki bhaajapa ne haalia chunaavon main kaalpanik vimarsh failaayaa jabaki logon kii rosemara ke muddon ko nazarandaaj kar diya

 alpamat vaali bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad kai anya rajyon main sabase badi party ke rup main chunaav jeetne vaale dalon ne bhi rajyapal ke saamne sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya he
 In a special conversation with 'aaj Tak' on this issue, former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat, while welcoming the Supreme judgment, named the BJP top as the villainous title of Mr
 India film
 saath hi is puure ghatnakram par unhone apana dard bhi bayaan kar diya
 Rawat said that he himself has been a victim of the conspiracy of the BJP when his government was dropped and President's rule was imposed in Uttarakhand
 iske baad hycourt or phir supreme court se hi unako nyaay mil paaya tha or unki sarkaar behaal hui thi
 The decision of the court is Harjeet Rawat in the BJP leader Yeddyurappa case clearly says that this decision is a slap on the Governor and the Central Government and their decision has been overturned
 unka kahana he ki jis gathbandhan ke paas purna samarthan he usko sarkaar banane ke liye bulaayaa janaa chahie tha
 Harish Rawat said that we had an alliance in Karnataka and a list of 117 mlas was also submitted to the Governor for that
 jedies ke kumaraswami ko netaa chune jane vaala patr bhi rajyapal ko diya gaya
 But instead of calling Kumaraswamy, BJP leader Yeddyurappa was called
 rajyapal ne iske saath hi 15 din kaa samay dekar apnigalat sochabhi jaahir kar di
 Regarding Tejaswi's chance of floor test, Harish Rawat also said that if the decision of Karnataka is accepted by the central government, then RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav should also get a chance to present his figures in the House
 tejasvi ne bhi bihar ke rajyapal ko patr saunpkar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya he
 Rawat alleged that BJP, bypassing democracy and constitution under Modi leadership, is engaged in creating only and only opposition-free India
 lekin loktantr ko khatre main daal kar aisa ho nahin saktaa, iske liye ham hameshaa sadakon par utrenge or desh ko galat soch vaali maansikta se har haal main bachaa kar le jaaenge

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, however, is skeptical about landing four fast bowlers as this will affect the over speed
 yah dekhnaa rochak hoga ki bristol ke halaat ko nazarandaaj karte hue kya dhoni do spinneron ke saath utarate hai kyonki shuukravaar ko middlesex ke khilaaf abhyaas match main unhone binni se gendbaaji nahin karai thi
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami bowled in small spells in the practice match, indicating that the team management wants to keep them fresh for the one-day Internationals
 ye donon tej gendbaaji akraman main pehali pasand hai lekin tisare gendbaaj kaa vikalp khulaa hua he
 This could be any of Umesh Yadav, Mohit Sharma and Dhawal Kulkarni including Binny
 bhartiya team paanch gendbaajon ke saath nahin utarana chaahegi kyonki aisi sthiti main ballebaaji par asar padegaa or team main dhoni sahit sirf chah ballebaaj rah jaaenge
 Also, the Indian team has faced big goals in South Africa and New Zealand on the last two overseas tour
 in donon dauron par saat maukon par team india ko lakshya kaa peechha karnaa padaa, jisamen paanch baar team naakaam rahi jabaki aaisland main ek match taai rahaa or ek match barish kii bhent chadh gaya
 Chasing a big score, the opening pair is under pressure and the opening pair of Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma scored 14, 10, 15, 22, 64 and eight for the first wicket for Team India in six odis over these two rounds

 suresh raina ko antim ekadash se baahar kiye jane ke baad ambati rayudu ko do maukey mili or unhone 37 or 20 ran banaae
 The team will now expect a good performance from the trio of Rahane, Rayudu and Raina

 Team India were all out in this match
 lekin rayudu ne 72 ran kii pari kheli, jabaki kohli ne bhi ardhashatak banaaya
 For England, this ODI series will be similar to the Test series where they had to face defeat to Sri Lanka before India, while they turned the game against Dhoni's team
 vishwa cap ko dekhte hue england ne apni team main kuch badlaav kiye he
 Ravi Bopara has been dropped from the squad, while Tim Bresnan and Michael Carberry have also not been given a chance

 com / otissy3b0v Former Australia World Cup winning captain Clarke told PTI that i believe Virat is the best batsman of all-time in one-day cricket
 bharat ke liye unhone jo kuch hasil kiya, usko dekhne ke baad mujhe isamen koi andeh nahin he
 Kohli has scored 10,385 runs in 219 odis so far
 isamen 39 shatak shaamil hai
 He also averages over 59
 kohli ke prashansak clark ne kaha ki is 30 varshiya cricketer ke junun kaa koi jawaab nahin he
 He said that you have to respect Virat's passion to win for his country
 haa usamen aakraamakata he lekin koi bhi uski patibaddhta par sawaal nahin uthaa saktaa
 He is the best in odis

 Dhoni no longer plays as aggressively as in odis
 lekin clark kaa maananaa he ki is 37 varshiya purv bhartiya captain ko apana khel khilne ke liye akelaa chhod dena chahie
 Clarke said that Dhoni knows how to play in a situation
 unhone 300 se adhik vanade khele hai, isliye vah jaanate hai ki apni bhoomika kaise nibhaani he
 # Stat Alert: King Kohli has made 9 centuries in his last 19 innings
 Here are some batsmen who have made 9 or fewer centuries in their entire career: k Pietersen (125 innings) s Watson (169 innings) Steve Smith (94 innings, 8 tons) Michael Clarke (223 innings, 8 tons) pic

 com / eilwxwobwq But if the target in the third ODI would have been 330 instead of 230, would Dhoni have been impressive? In response to this question, Clarke said, "I think he would have batted differently
" lakshya 230 ran kaa tha or unki ranneeti isi ke anukool thi or agar lakshya bada hota to unki ranneeti bhinn hoti
 Clarke was asked which number in the batting order of Dhoni in the World Cup, he said that four, five or six at any place
 vah kisi bhi number par ballebaaji karne main sakasham hai or mujhe lagata he ki viraat unka paristhitiyon ke anusaar upyog karegaa
 Clarke, however, said that the currently suspended Hardik Pandya will play an important role in the Indian campaign in the World Cup to be held in England
 australia ke purv captain ne kaha ki hardik jaisaa pratibhashali khilaadi team main santulan banane ke liye behad jaruri hai
 He can win matches only with his batting and i believe he will be part of the World Cup squad

 gauratlab he ki katju ne mamata ko taanashaah, ashishnu or manamaujee bartaav vaala bataaya he
 The BJP said it was the duty of the leaders to respond and they could not run away from it, while Mamata's arch rival CPI (M) termed the arrest of this man named Shiladitya Chaudhary as "unfortunate and frightening"
 darasal, choudhary ne ek raily main mukhyamantri se kaha tha ki kisaan mar rahe hai or khokhale vaade se kaam nahin chalegaa
 On this, the Chief Minister was surprised and called Chaudhary the Maoist and asked the police to arrest him

 Lalu Prasad Yadav said that the country has gone into the wrong hands

 He had said that he and Nitish Kumar are indeed the same family, and he is like Nitish's elder brother, so, where will Nitish go if he does not come in his lap
 isi ke baad unhone rashtriya str par bijepi ko parrast karne kii zarurat bataai, or uttar pradesh ke netaaon mulaayam singh yadav or mayawati se bhi ek saath aane kii apil kii thi

 After the meeting between Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and his uncle Shivpal Yadav on Friday, the snow has melted in the relationship

 There has been a wrong message to merge his party and cancel it

 azmikaifi
 com shuru kii he
 This website has provided detailed information about Kafi Azmi's life related works and about them
 caphi azmi ne hindi filmon ke liye bahut kuch likhaa
 Kaifi Azmi's Najm is still alive in people's minds
 caphi sahab kaa janm uttar pradesh ke azamgarh jile ke mijawan main 14 janvari 1918 ko hua tha
 Kafi Azmi's famous Ghazalaj has very hot air, no sleep on the sidewalk tonight
 sab utho, main bhi uthun, tum bhi utho, tum bhi utho,koi khidki isi diwaar main khul jaaegi
 This land was still ready to swallow, when we came down from the broken branches, these houses are not known, but the rest of the days which passed through the caves
 haath dhalate gaye saanchon main to thakte kaise,naqsh ke baad nae naqsh nikhaare hamane,kii ye diwaar buland, or buland, or buland,balm-o-dar or zaraa or nikhaare hamane
 We used to break the winds, the flame of the evening, we rooted, so we became the stars of lightning, but someone sat on the watch, while we were sleeping, we took shorish-e-tamir
 apni nas-nas main liye mehnat-e-paham kii thakn,band aankhon main isi kasr kii tasviir liye,din pighalta he isi tarah saron par ab tak,raat aankhon main khatkati he siyaah tir liye
 Tonight a very hot wind blows, tonight neither will you sleep on the pavement, all get up, i also wake up, you also wake up, you also wake up, a window will open in this wall
 koi to sood chukaaye, koi to jimmaa leus inkalab kaa

 Kaifi Sahab received many honors including National Award, Sahitya Puraskar, Filmfare Award
 caphi azmi kii pratibha ko pehali baar pahchaan tab mili jab 11 saal kii umr main wo apane pita-bhai ke saath ek mushaayare main gaye
 In this Mushaira, his father and brother were surprised after listening to Ghazal read by Kaifi Azmi
 bete kii pratibha ko pahchaanane ke liye jab caphi azmi ke pita ne unhen ek ghazal likhane ko kaha, to caphi sahab ne bina kisi deree ke ek ghazal likhi
 Famous Ghazal singer Begum Akhtar gave her voice to this ghazal written in a few moments
 caphi sahab ne jo ghazal 11 saal kii umr main likhi thi wo kuch yun thi, ' itnaa to jindagi main kisi kii khalal pade, hansane se ho sukun naa rone se kal pade'
 At the age of 19, Kaifi Azmi joined the Communist Party of India
 jiske baad caphi kaumi jang akhbaar main kaam karne ke liye mumbai chale gaye
 It was from here that Kaifi got a reason to write and to improve his writing
 to agar aap caphi azmi or unki gajalon ke bare main jaananaa chaahate hai to is website kaa rukh kiijie
 Because Kaifi Azmi itself has said- "somebody should pay the money, some will take responsibility of the revolution, which is still borrowed till date"

 Amit Shah goes to Ayodhya and says that Ram temple will be built here, while Rajnath gives a statement in defense

 twitor par aap rahul par sawaal uthaate rahete hai par hakeekat he ki jab se rahul vaais president bane hai, nai-nai ranneeti bana rahe hai
 The Congress has not yet decided whether to conduct the elections next year or in October
 aktubar main chunaav ke sapane to aap hi dekh rahe hai kyonki congress to pehle hi kah chuki he ki chunaav 2014 main hi honge
 They will not tell until the last time that they want to hold the elections in October
 modi ne khud ko hindu rashtravaadi kyon kaha? ve bhartiya rashtravaadi bhi kah sakate the
 Someone asked Modi the question, are they Hindu nationalists? He said that yes, i am a Hindu as well as a nationalist
 unhone keval bayaan diya tha
 Your policy is that the Hindu vote bank be united and the Muslim vote bank divided? Absolutely
 meraa to maananaa he ki hindu vot bank ikattha karo, musalmaan vot bank ko baanto
 Politics in the name of religion is dangerous for the country? Why should there not be such politics? We are 80 per cent Hindus and if 7 per cent of the 14 per cent Muslims come with us then how will it become dangerous
 aaj shiya or kai musalmaan hamaare saath hai

 'ellen Border Medal' is given to the best cricketer of the year
 yuva cricketer seen abt ko saal kaa sarvshereshth yuva cricketer kaa breadman award diya gaya he

 visphotak ballebaaj glen maxwell ko saal kaa tii20 cricketer chunaa gaya
 Sean Abbott was awarded the young cricketer of the year, Jason Behrendorf the domestic player of the year and Meg Lanning the 'belinda Clarke Medal' for the best female cricketer
 smith ne pichley ek saal main test hi nahin balki vanade main bhi shandaar pradarshan kiya
 He led the team successfully in the recently concluded border-gavaskar Trophy against India in the absence of Michael Clarke and during this time, he himself showed a brilliant batting and scored 769 runs with the help of four centuries in the four-match series
 isse vah sarvshereshth test cricketer kii daud main david warner ko chaar maton se peeche chhodane main safal rahe
 As for the ODI matches, Smith started as the 12th player in Perth earlier this season against South Africa but did not look back when he got the chance

 After demonetisation is implemented in the country, banks have reduced the interest on deposits in savings bank
 desh ke sabase bade sarkari bank state bank of india ne byaaj daron ko 4 fisadi se kam kar diya
 Obviously, your money lying in a savings account will not be able to give better returns now
 aisi sthiti main aap liquid fund main nivesh karke seaving bank se doguna phayda kama sakate hai
 What is a liquid fund? a short-term investment fund is called a liquid fund
 ise mani market fund bhi kaha jaataa he
 Liquid funds are a better investment option to generate higher returns over a short period of time
 haalanki is fund main bhi kisi anya mutual kii tarah hi kuch risk bhi maujuud he
 But the most important thing about this fund is that here you can invest for any period ranging from 1 day to 1 year
 is fund main nivesh kaa sabase behatar phayda aapako prati maah apni bachi hui selary ke nivesh par mil saktaa he
 No penalty on exit
 You do not have to pay any kind of exit load when you withdraw your money from the liquid fund at any time
 vahiin kisi duusare mutual fund main aap shaamil hote hai yaa apana nivesh baahar nikaalte hai to aapako shulk adaa karnaa padataa he jise lod kehete hai
 Return on Investment can be up to 8%
 Financial experts believe that investing in different liquid funds can yield up to 8%
 vahiin kisi bhi bank ke seaving acount main sirf 4 fisadi kaa hi ritern mil paata he
 Whenever inflation rises in the country, the biggest danger remains that the central bank should pay interest on savings, which reduces your savings
 mahangaai ke dauraan bhi liquid fund aapako behatar ritern dene kaa vaada karata he
 You will get back in 24 hours
 One of the biggest advantages of your money fund is that you can get back your invested money by selling it in just 24 hours
 udhaaharan ke liye aap yadi somvaar kii shaam liquid fund main lage apane paise ko baahar nikaalnaa he to bas ise bechney ke liye kol kar den or mangalvaar subah bank khulte hi aapkaa paisa sidhe aapke bank khate main pahunch jayega
 However any investment in the market carries its own risk along with this investment
 mahaj khabar ke aadhaar par kisi bhi fund main nivesh na karen
 Before investing in any fund, get complete information or invest only with the advice of your financial advisor

 In our world, there is an abundance of people working with the right hand
 yahaan tak ki rhite ko sahi or left ko galat ke arth main bhi liya jaataa he
 Since childhood, we are taught that we should eat with right hand, try to write with that hand too
 left hand kaa istemaal karne waalon kaa sankhya bhi apekshaakrit kam he
 90 percent of the world's people write with the right hand
 duniya ke keval 10 fisadi log lefti hai
 This does not necessarily mean that left hand users are inferior in any way
 haalanki aisi aam manyata he ki left hand se kaam karne vaale asaamaanya or kamjor hote he
 Perhaps this is the reason why parents use the left hand many times, and sometimes they are also strict
 is baat kaa doosraa pahalu bhi he
 In the meantime, some such research and fact have come in front of us which completely demolish the old concepts
