 ) The noise of the unemployment movement is gradually spreading throughout the country
 saalon se chale aa rahe sarkari system ke is shraap se devbhumi uttarakhand bhi peeche nahin he
 According to a survey revealed in December last year, the number of unemployed in Uttarakhand is going to reach nine lakhs
 inamen takreeban 5
 53 lakh men then 3
 45 lakh mahila berozegaar shaamil hai
 The surprising thing is that most of the unemployed are registered in Dehradun
 aankadon ke anusaar dehradun main register mahila berozegaron kii sankhya purush berozegaron se adhik he
 There are 94,582 female unemployed and 88,364 male unemployed registers
 bhaajapa or congress donon hi jimmedaar-berogari ke is masale ko vipaksh nebharadisann (gairsann)main hue pehle bajet satr main uthaaya
 However, both Congress and BJP are responsible for the increased unemployment figures in the state
 iskaa nateeja ye he ki aaj yahaan ke yuva sarkaron se aas lagaakar haar chuke hai, or sadakon par niraashaa kaa pradarshan kar apni haq kii ladaai kar rahe hai
 The secretariat shouted - as a result, on Monday, hundreds of youths of Uttarakhand unemployed union in the temporary capital Dehradun took out a grand rally against the state's Trivendra government
 niraashaa or intjaar se bhare in yuvaaon kii yah mahareli sachivalay kooch karne vaali thi
 Though the protesters were stopped by heavy police force by barricading earlier, the unemployed union raised fierce slogans against the state government, ignoring allegations against the youth of the state
 kya he aarope-uttarakhand berozegaar sangh kaa aarope he ki vibhaagon main khaali pade padon par sarkaar koi sunwaayee nahin kar rahi hai, maheenon se jari padon kii vijyapti par koi parikshaayen nahin karai ja rahi hai
 The government is misleading the educated youth of the state in the name of providing employment
 jaise ki rajya kii janata ko rajdhani ke naam par lollypop pakadaaya ja rahaa he
 In such a way, seeing the way the youth have come on the streets, it is enough to guess that the unemployed youth has now spoken
 2019 main aane vaale loksabhaa chunaavon ko lekar ise acha sanket nahin mana ja saktaa, isliye ab trivendra singh ravat or unki sarkaar ko vaaki gambhirtha se sochane kii jarurat he or sahi raste apanaakar koi naa koi hal nikaalane kii bhi jarurat he, kyonki yuva hi he jo desh kii takadir badalata he or uttarakhand ke aane vaale chunaav bhi bahut had tak yuva varg ke hi haathon main hai jo lagaataar phisalata ja rahaa he
 These are the demands of the unemployed union protesters - the vacant posts of group-c should be filled soon, the examinations released should be conducted immediately - the vacant posts of Patwari, 1500 posts of Forest Reserve, 1500 posts of Police and Excise The recruitment process should be completed
 -alti va pravaktaa ke 7000 pad rikt hai unhen 29 disambar 2016 se purv niyamavali ke tahat behaal kiya jaae
 -the posts of Yoga teachers in each school should be restored - The appointment of b
ed
, TET-1 passed merit holders as priority teachers should be settled by 2019
 -peyajal nigam va ayog main ejineering ke sabhi padon ko jald se jald bharaa jaae
 -diploma pharmacy posts should be released immediately
 -rajya lok seva ayog ke pariksha main CSAT main keval kwalifai ho va rajya lokseva ayog kii pariksha UPSC ke tarj par ho
 - Essentials of 'O' level in the posts of Assistant Accountants should be abolished
 aaj berogari kii samasya viksit evam alpaviksit donon prakaar kii arthvyavasthaaon kii pramukh samasya banati ja rahi he
 In an underdeveloped economy like India, it is holding explosive form
 aane vaali pidiyon ke liye ghor niraashaa kaa kaaran he kyonki desh main berogari kii is khai par nae bharat or new india kii neenv nahin rakhi ja sakati

 bihar kii siyasat nai karavat leti najar aa rahi he
 Everything is not going well in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led NDA
 biharke mukhyamantri or janata dal united (jediu) ke adhyakshanitishakumar ko bijepi saadhane main jahaan kaamyaab hui, vahiin abarelspike adhyaksh upendrakushvaahane 'siyaasi kheer' banane kaa formula diya he
 For this, he indicated the alliance of Yaduvanshis and Kushvans
 lekin sawaal ye he ki kya donon ke milan se kheer main mithaas ghul paaegi?bihar kii raajnneeti main 2017 main nitish kumaar ne lalu prasad yadav kaa saath chhodkar dobaaraa endie main shaamil ho gaye hai
 The BJP seems to be ready to accept Nitish Kumar as his elder brother in the state
 aise main nitish or bijepi ke bich gahari hoti dosti 2014 main modi ke saathi bane upendra kushvaha ko raas nahin aa rahi he
 The enemy of the enemy is a friend, that is being done in Bihar to make a saying
 modi sarkaar main mantri upendra kushvaha ne do din pehle hi patna main beepi mandal kii janmashti samaaroh main ishaaron-ishaaron menargedike saath gathbandhan ke sanket die hai
 Kushwaha said, 'if you get milk of Yaduvanshi (yadav) and rice of Kushwanshi (koiri Samaj), then kheer will be good and nothing can stop the preparation of that delicious dish
 'haalanki, unhone ise or spasht karte hue kaha ki yah kheer tab tak swaadisht nahin hogi jab tak isamen choti jatiyon or dabe-kuchle samaaj kaa panchmeva nahin padegaa
 This is the real definition of social justice
 argedy netaa tejasvi yadavane twit karte hue upendra kushvaha ke bayaan kaa samarthan kiya he
 Tejaswi has said that undoubtedly delicious and nutritious kheer is needed by the laboring people
 panchmeva ke swasthyavardhak gun na keval sharir balki swasth samtamulak samaaj ke nirmaan main bhi urja dete hai
 Kheer prepared with love spirit has a lot of nutrition, taste and energy and is a good dish
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko maat dene ke liye argedy netaa tejasvi yadav is baar yadav, muslim or dalit maton ke saath-saath obisi maton ko bhi apane paale main laane kii kavayad kar rahe hai
 Whereas after Nitish's entry in the NDA, there is not much political space left for Upendra Kushwaha
 es main kushvaha bhi ek majboot siyaasi saathi ke talash main hai
 Upendra Kushwaha and Lalu Prasad Yadav may prove to be trump cards for each other
 upendra kushvaha koiri samaaj se aate hai, bihar main is samudaay kaa kareeb 3 fisadi vot hai
 While the original vote bank of Lalu Prasad Yadav is Yadav and Muslim
 bihar kii kul jansankhya main 16 fisadi muslim or 14
 4% of the population is Yadav
 iske alaava dalit or pichhadon main acha khaasaa lalu kaa janaadhar he
 In such a situation, if Kushwaha and Lal Yadav come together, a strong political equation of the state can be formed
 isi maddenjar tejasvi yadav lagaataar upendra kushvaha kii tarif karte rahe hai
 At the same time, Kushwaha has also been meeting time and time again to strengthen his relationship with Lalu Yadav
 bataa den ki 2014 ke liye jab bijepi ne narendra modi ke naam kii ghoshnaa kii to nitish kumaar ne endie se alag hokar lalu yadav se haath mila liya
 In such a situation, the BJP won the 2014 battle with small parties of Bihar
 inamen upendra kushvaha kirashtriya lok samta party (rlsp)or ramvilas paswan kii lok janashakti party bhi shaamil thi
 The result of the alliance with the BJP was that the three Lok Sabha members of the RLSP were successful in winning and Upendra Kushwaha was awarded the ministerial post when the Modi government was formed
 pichley saal piem narendra modi ne nitish kumaar ko mahagathbandhan se alag kar apane saath milakar lalu yadav ko badi raajnneetik maat di thi
 In such a situation, RJD also wants to equalize with Modi
 argedy ne purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ko endie se nikaalkar apane saath milakar bijepi ko jhatka de chuki hai
 After Manjhi, RJD now wants to equalize the BJP by combining Upendra Kushwaha who comes from Koiri community
 vahiin, kushvaha bhi nitish kumaar se apni raajnneetik dushmani kaa hisaab karnaa chaahate hai
 But it has to be seen how sweet the political pudding made by the alliance of Yaduvanshis and Kushvansis will be

 unhone kaha, 'congress party ko samarthan karne ke jama masjid ke shahi imam ke faisle kaa main puri tarah se virodh karata hum or iskaa kaaran yah he ki yadi aap desh main eemaandaaree se kisi musalmaan se puuchhen to meraa maananaa he ki congress party ko sabase zyada sampradayik party bataaya jayega
 ' saiyad yahia ne kaha, 'musalmaan kehete hai ki bhaajapa sampradayik party he, haa he
 But the BJP attacks the minorities, it attacks from the front, Muslims save themselves but the Congress has always stabbed them in the back
 ' He also spared the BJP and attacked the saffron party, claiming that the BJP was behind the riots in Gujarat
 yah jagajaahir baat he ki is bare main har koi jaanata he, lekin congress ne bhi musalamaanon ko nahin choda he
 He said, 'reverse the record of the last 30-35 years, whether it is Bhagalpur, Meerut, Moradabad or Surat
 yah sab congress ke kaarykaal ke dauraan hua, yahaan tak ki yah aaj bhi ho rahaa he
 Innocent Muslims are being sent to jail
 ' Junior Bukhari said, "whenever the election comes, the Congress tries to be clean and show solidarity with the Muslims and seek their support

 But it has been a tradition that the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid does not go to anyone to give his support
 unhone kaha, 'iske bajaay, chaahe vah indira gandhi hon yaa veepi singh yaa anya purv pradhanmantri ve log aae or shahi imam kaa samarthan maanga

 isse 16 lakh 65 hajaar se zyada kisaanon kaa 6100 karod rupee se adhik kaa karj maaf hoga
 He had said that Congress President Rahul Gandhi had promised that within 10 days of the formation of the government the debt of farmers would be forgiven

 He said that we believe that debt waiver will be helpful in economic and social upliftment and empowerment of farmers
 baghel ne kaha tha ki rahul gandhi ke vaayade ke mutabik, sarkaar ne shapath lene ke baad dhan kii kharidi dar 2500 rupee prati quintal karne kaa bhi nirnay kiya he
 He had also said that the Jhiram Valley incident would be investigated by the SIT

 While speaking to reporters, Chidambaram admitted that the challenge in terms of inflation and investment remains
 vittamantri ne vittiya ghate ko jidipi kaa 4
 Aimed to have 8 percent
 unhen ummid he ki chaalu khate kaa ghaataa bhi 60 arab dollar tak simit rahegaa
 Chidambaram asked industry to invest in projects instead of sitting on cash, a day after the figures released to show production growth at 8 percent in eight core industries
 chidambaram ne kaha, buniyadi kshetra kii vruddhi
 
 behatar monsoon or niryaat main teji aarthik vruddhi ke liye achche sanket hai
 However, many challenges remain and the most important are the inflation and investment challenge
 vittamantri ne kaha, lekin meraa maananaa he ki nivesh main bhi gatividhiyaan bad rahi he
 We are confident that with the Reserve Bank and our own measures to maintain fiscal discipline, inflation will come down in the end
 chidambaram ne kaha ki sarkaar lambey samay se pade beemaa sanshodhan vidheyak ko sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main paarit kara legi
 The bill provides for increasing foreign direct investment in insurance sector from the present 26 percent to 49 percent

 bhartiya itihaas kii sabase badi vidyut andhergardi kaa netritv karne ke kuch hi ghanton baad kendriya urja mantri susheel kumaar scindia ko pramotion dekar grih mantralay jaisaa nitant ahm vibhaag de diya gaya
 Due to this severe power crisis, there was a dark shadow in the entire north and eastern India for 16 hours during the last two days of July and affected about 67 crore people
 scindia kii tarakkee desh ke liye gambhir chintaa kii baat he
 As a home minister, he has to anticipate and stop the complex terrorist conspiracies being hatched against India on the basis of half-baked intelligence
 kendriya urja mantri ke rup main scindia desh ke 5 main se 3 rashtriya power grid ke puri tarah baith jane kaa koi purvanumaan nahin laga paae, na use roak paae, jabaki unhen is tarah ke sankat ke bare main saaf jaankaree thi
 In front of Shinde, the warning red light was continuously burning
 par yaa to pad par rahete hue ve so rahe the yaa unhone behad galat kadam uthaae
 Shinde, who was the Energy Minister for nearly six years, knew that the country has always been struggling with power crisis
 march, 2012 main pesh aarthik survey main sarkaar ke apane anumaanon ke mutabik hi bijli kii maang or aapurti main kareeb 8 fisadi kaa antar he jo ki peak time main badhkar 10 fisadi tak ho jaataa he
 Shinde also knew that the demand for electricity increases rapidly when the monsoon rains decrease
 june-july main monsoon kii barish kaaphi kam hui he, yah jaankaree mantri ko honi hi chahie
 They will also know that usually when the monsoon fails, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh draw more power from the central pool as farmers there have to run pump sets for irrigation
 centre sarkaar inhen rajyon par bijli sankat kaa thikra phod rahi he
 The July data of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) shows that these three states, along with Rajasthan, are drawing more power than the quota already set for at least two weeks before the grid sits down in mid-july
 galati karne vaale rajyon ko raste par laane ke liye kaaphi samay tha
 But Shinde's Ministry of Power did little more than issue a warning letter on 12 July
 mantralay se istipha dene ke baad jab scindia se is bare main safai maangi gai to isamen unki koi dilchaspee nahin dikhi
 He said, "I have given information to the PMO
 america main to bijli chaar din tak kati rahi thi, yahaan hamane to kuch hi ghanton main behaal kar diya
 People should praise the way the grid worked
 '' scindia ke ejeeniyar shaayad bijli aapurti behaal rakhane main sakasham honge lekin scindia ne hi is tarah kii ghatana ko hone diya
 The investigation committee formed by Shinde will find out the reasons for the crisis, which led to such a huge crisis for the first time after 2001
 urja mantralay ke sutron kaa kahana he ki dilli se agra or agra se gwalior ke bich hi kahin transmishan line main overloding hui thi
 Due to this, the needle of suspicion goes completely on UP, although Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan were also getting more electricity than quota when the grid failed
 uttar pradesh ke bijli mahakme ke afasar jaanate the ki unka kuch nahin bigadega kyonki is tarah kii anushaasanheenata ke liye scindia ke mantralay ne kabhi bhi sakhti se koi dand nahin lagaaya tha
 Unfortunately, even with imposition of financial penalty, no state is afraid of it because as per the current rules, states have to draw more power than quota 1 per kilowatt-hour
 65 ru
 a fine of Rs
 jabaki khule exenjon par bijli kareeb 9 ru
 Sold per unit
 yani rajyon ko grid kaa anushaasan tod jurmaana bharne main bhi nuksaan nahin hota
 In March 2012 itself, the CERC suggested that the financial penalty for indiscipline in the grid should be increased, but the Ministry of Power has not yet decided on these suggestions
 samajhdaari bharaa samaadhaan to yahi hoga ki jurmaana badha diya jaae or aisi vyavastha apanaai jaae jisamen kendriya pool se bijli kharidne vaale rajyon se paisa advance liya jaae
 There is another strong solution that Shinde could implement ‚Äî they could order that the states that have made a habit of mistake cut their leaves from the central grid
 lekin rajnatik kamajori aisa kabhi nahin hone degi
 An Energy Ministry official said, "can you really imagine Shinde cutting off the power of Mulayam Singh's Uttar Pradesh?" The Congress often becomes cowardly in front of its allies
 khaskar is samay, jab vah apni satta bachaane ke liye mulaayam singh par nirbhar he
 Shinde got a term of 6 years to bridge the gap between the demand and supply of electricity, but his achievement in this matter is very poor
 unke kaarykaal ke dauraan bijli utpaadan kshamta kehane ko to 50 fisadi bad gai lekin vaastavik utpaadan sirf 17 fisadi badha
 The biggest problem is the lack of proper availability of coal to the thermal power stations of the country
 desh ke kul bijli utpaadan kaa kareeb 65 fisadi hissaa koyale par nirbhar he
 This dependence on coal increases further when monsoon rains are less
 uttar pradesh ke sonbhadra main sthit anapara thermal power project kaa hi udhaaharan len
 The two plants located in this project have a total power generation capacity of 1,630 MW
 june or july main anapara se roj ausatan 1,300 megawatt bijli kaa utpaadan hua jo uski kul kshamta se kareeb 20 fisadi kam he
 a senior official of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation attached to this plant said, "anpara needs 25,000 tons of coal daily, but this summer she got 20,000 to 21,000 tons of coal daily
 ''bharat main philhal 8
 There is a shortage of 50 million tonnes of coal
 kol india limited kaa lagaataar yah tark rahaa he ki jangalon ke bade ilaakon ko koyala khanan ke liye no-go aria nirdhaarit karne ke paryaavaran mantralay ke nirnay se vah utpaadan badhaane main naakaam ho rahi he
 As environment minister, Jairam Ramesh continued to deny any concession in the interest of infrastructure and industries
 lekin upie ke apane style ke mutabik hi pradhanmantri ne unhen padonnati dekar july 2011 main gramin vikaas kaa cabinet mantri bana diya taaki unhen sahajata se paryaavaran mantralay se baahar kiya ja sake
 Till then, Ramesh has in a way locked the new coal mines, which Jayanthi Natarajan, who became the Minister of Environment after him, has not reversed
 kol india or uske bos koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal bhi kam doshi nahin hai
 Some experts say that Coal India can do mining in those areas which are not under the 'no-go', but this cash-rich monopoly company seems to have little need to do so
 jaiswal ne kol india ke prabandhan kii chulein kasne ke liye kuch khaas nahin kiya or aisa koi kadam nahin uthaaya jisase isko kuch pratispardhaa mili
 Imported coal is very expensive
 urja mantri ke rup main scindia apane sahyogiyon ko is baat ke liye manaane main naakaam rahe ki koyala aapurti badhaane kii tatkaal jarurat he
 According to a senior official who was present at an inter-ministerial meeting attended by Shinde, Jaiswal and Natarajan, Shinde was unimpressed
 adhikari ne bataaya, ''ve puri tarah chup baithe rahe, jabaki duusare mantri apni baat rakh rahe the
 "the main villain of the power crisis is the central government, but the states also played an important role in it
 diwalia ho chuke rajya bijli board bijli sankat ke centre main hai
 The total loss of all the State Electricity Boards is about one lakh crore rupees
 tak pahunch chukaa he jo ki desh ke jidipi ke ek fisadi ke baraabar he
 Everyone knows the reason for their bankruptcy
 pehali baat to yah he ki rajya bijli bordon se hone vaali aapurti kaa ausatan 30 fisadi to nasht ho jaataa he
 This electricity is either stolen or wasted due to poor infrastructure
 jin bijli bordon kaa nijeekaran ho chukaa he, unamem is tarah se hone vaale nuksaan ko kam kiya ja sakaa he
 For example, CESC of Kolkata has reduced such losses to below 10%
 muft or sabsidi vaali bijli dene kii raajnneeti boj ko or badhaati he
 The cost of electricity supply in Uttar Pradesh is Rs 6
 prati unit padati he, lekin iske liye upabhoktaaon se 3
 5 Rs
 prati unit hi liye jate he
 The Mayawati-led Uttar Pradesh government had raised electricity rates twice during its 5-year tenure
 lekin loklubhaavan raste par chalane vaale akhilesh ne ab bijli keemton main kisi tarah kii badhat se inkaar kiya he
 There was no increase in electricity rates for nine years before Jayalalithaa came to power in 2011 in Tamil Nadu, another state always facing power crisis
 bijli daron main sanshodhan na kar paane kii vifaltaa swatantra bijli niamakon kii asahaayta ko bhi darshaati he
 "they are expected to act independent of the government, but in most cases they do not," says a senior official
 '' akele rajasthan ke rajya bijli board ko 46,000 karod ru
 Has lost baari ghate kaa matlab he ki rajya ke paas ab bijli ke network vistaar par kharch ke liye koi paisa nahin he or vah bas kisi tarah se bijli utpaadan ko barkaraar rakh paa rahaa he
 1,600 crore in 2011 to the Bihar State Electricity Board
 kaa ghaataa hua jo 2007 main hue ghate kaa doguna he
 During the seven-year tenure of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the Bihar government has done nothing in the field of power generation
 vah bijli utpaadan main ek megawatt kii bhi badhat nahin kar pai he
 The financial condition of electricity boards is not such that they can buy power from any private producers
 nae bijli utpaadan unit taiyaar karne ke liye rajya sarkaron ke paas paisa nahin he
 Private power producers are also not getting any incentive to set up power units in these states
 isliye rajyon ke bijli board ke paas apane kendriya aavanton se zyada bijli khinchne kaa rasta hi bachataa he
 This is a vicious cycle that most states are unable to break
 scindia ko bijli kshetra kii sabhi samasyaon ko dur karne ke liye 6 saal mili
 But he himself was seen patting himself for his excellent performance when he left office, while the public is devastated by his leadership during his tenure in UPA-1 and UPA-2

 sabhi gharon main bhagwaan kii murtiyon or tasviir hoti hi hai lekin bahut hi kam log jaanate honge ki sabhi murtiyon shubh nahin hoti
 According to Vastu, there are also many idols, which can be inauspicious for a human being
 ham aapako bhagwaan ke aise hi kuch swaroop or murtiyon ke bare main bataane ja rahe hai, jinke darshan karnaa acha nahin mana jaataa
 
 
 - The idol of God should be kept in the house in such a way that the back part of it is not visible
 bhagavanaki peeth kaa dikhnaa shubh nahin mana jaataa
 - It is also not good to keep two idols of the same god in the place of worship
 khaastaur par agar donon murtiyon aas-paas yaa aamane-saamne ho
 Visiting such idols leads to repeated battles
 - bhale hi kisi murti se kitni hi gahari aasthaa judi ho, lekin murti khandit ho jaae to uske darshan karnaa acha nahin hota he
 Visiting or worshiping such an idol is inauspicious
 -mandirmen bhagwaan kii aisi murti rakhni chahie, jisamen unka munh saumy or haath aashirwad kii mudra main ho
 Visiting the ugly and depressed idol brings negative energy
 - bhagwaan kii aisi kisi murti ke darshan nahin karne chahie, jisamen wo yuddh karte yaa kisi kaa vinaash karte dikh rahe hon
 Visiting such an idol can also become a cause of sorrows

 gauratlab he ki is varsh kii shuruyaat main hyderabad ke chaatr rohit vemula kii khudakushi kaa maamla bade raajnneetik vivaad kaa kaaran bana tha

 He said that we were talking about a dead child and he was sitting smiling

 unhone kaha ki ham ek mrit bachche ke bare main baat kar rahe the or vah muskuraate hue baithe the

 48 ghante se kam samay ke bheetar sibiai ke nideshak alok verma ko pad se hataane kaa faisla hua he
 He stays on leave for 77 days, a hearing is held in the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court decides that Verma can be reinstated, but routine decisions can be taken
 jin kaarnon se unhen pad bhaar se mukt kiya tha, us par hai power cameti vichaar karegi
 This high power committee consists of Prime Minister Modi, Supreme Court Justice AK Sikri and Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge
 do din baithak hoti he or faisla hota he ki alok verma ko pad se hataaya jaataa he
 The allegations leveled against him are found to be correct
 alok verma ne hi pichley saal apane number tu special diarector rakesh asthana ke khilaaf exiaar ke aadesh die the
 He was accused of taking a bribe of 3 crores
 asthana ne dilli hai court main yachika lagaai he ki exiaar radd kii jaae
 a decision has not been taken on this petition yet
 asthana ne bhi alok verma par aarope lagaaya ki ve moin kuraishi maamle main jaanch aage nahin badhane de rahe hai
 Alok Verma, assuming the post on 9 January, ordered the recall of those officers, who were transferred by Acting Director m Nageswara Rao on 24 October 2018
 gujarat kader ke ipies e ke sharma ko waapas joint diarector ke pad par le aate hai
 m Nageswara Rao sent Sharma to the Multi Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA)
 personal vibhaag main bheje gaye diaiji aneesh prasad ko phir se sarvelans unit main laayaa jaataa he
 The DIG also orders MK Sinha to be brought back
 sinha ne hi supreme court main aarope lagaaya tha ki rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar adit dowaal asthana ke maamle main dakhal de rahe hai
 DSP AK Bassi, who was sent to Andaman, also returns to Delhi headquarters
 ab alok verma ke in adeshon kaa kya hoga
 18 transfers in two days
 kai afasaron ne tabadale ke baad bhi jwine nahin kar sake the
 Notably, MK Sinha, who accused Ajit Doval of interfering, also refused to join
 phir unhen ek nae pad par tabadalaa kaa aadesh hota he
 Three months later, these people have been called to Delhi headquarters again, will they be returned again now? verma ne 18 tabadale kiye hai
 DSP Devendra Kumar has filed a petition in the Delhi High Court against his decision that these decisions should be stayed
 is par sunwaayee shuukravaar ko honi he
 Verma was believed to be indicating that he was hitting the government with these decisions
 lekin kya ve aisa karte hue verma supreme court ke aadesh kii bhaavana ko lagu nahin kar rahe the jisamen court ne kaha he ki sibiai kaa pramukh khaskar diarector ko eemaandaaree or azaadi kaa ek role model hona chahie
 Only such a person can ensure the autonomy of the institution with all kinds of external controls and interference
 iske liye zaruri he ki sabhi prakaar kii sansthaaon ko sibiai diarector ke kaam main dakhal dene se roka jaae
 When it is imagined that the director of the CBI will be honest and take independent decisions free from all kinds of external pressures, then how can it be said that Alok Verma was hitting on the government
 baharhaal hai power cameti ne alok verma kaa tabadalaa kar diya he
 Verma is scheduled to retire on 31 January
 rakesh asthana abhi chuttee par hai
 What will happen to them is not clear
 rahul gandhi ne twit kiya tha ki sarkaar verma ko hataane kii jaldbaazi kar rahi he kyonki bhay he ki kahin verma rafaal maamle main jaanch ke aadesh na kar den
 Verma did nothing of the sort until his decision to be removed
 may 2013 main supreme court ne hi sibiai ko pinjre main band tota kaha tha
 In January 2019, you will decide what is happening in this cage
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki jis sivisi kii report ke aadhaar par tabadalaa kar diya use to roak diya magar us aadhaar par faisla lene kaa adhikaar chunaav samiti par chhod diya
 Based on the same report, the decision must have been made by Mallikarjun Kharge
 nita sharma ne kaha ki is tarah se kabhi sibiai nideshak ko nahin hataaya gaya he
 Neeta said that the government has formed a panel of 20 officers for the election of the new chief, out of which one will be elected as the chief
 sivisi ke paas asthana kii bhi shikaayat he jo alok verma ne kii thi
 What will happen to that complaint? alok verma 36 ghante ke bheetar hataa die gaye hai
 You will remember when Alok Verma ordered an FIR against Rakesh Asthana, then after midnight, the headquarters is surrounded and the new acting director Nageswara Rao is sent to take charge
 verma ko chuttee par bhej diya jaataa he
 Today, Alok Verma was removed again
 bas pichhali baar aadhi raat ke baad hataae gaye or is baar aadhi raat ke pehle hataa die gaye
 What was the hurry to remove a director, what happened that Alok Verma, who was made the Chief by the Select Committee, was removed 21 days before retirement
 is 21 din main ek nideshak kya kar saktaa tha
 All these questions will continue to resonate, but when Delhi takes a decision at night, one should not guess the light by looking at the stars
 raat se zyaada kahaniyaan ab lambii ho jaaengi
 Things will keep revolving
 sawaal kaa jawaab kya milegaa jiske bare main sibiai ne khud court main kaha he ki yah vasuuli kaa adda ban gaya tha
 Ali Fazal, who is very serious about his fitness, is not only working hard to fulfill his target but is also following a secret diet plan
 or yah sikret diet plan unhen kisi or ne nahin balki unke fast and furious-7 ke ko star vin dijal ne diya he
 Hollywood's most fit actor Vin Diesel is so serious about his health that there is nothing more than fitness for him
 jab vin dijal se mili unke sikret diet plan ke bare main ali se baat kii gai to unhone kaha, 'main hameshaa se unki fitness kaa divaana rahaa hum
 i was always impressed with him during the shoot and i told him this
 meri baaten sunakar hi unhone mujhe fitness tricks ke saath kaaphi tips bhi die
 And i am thankful to him for the fact that he shared his diet plan with me

 Five months ago, when the Supreme Court ordered the reopening of the dance bar in Mumbai, it seemed that the night life of Mayanagari would change again soon
 band pade dance baar par kanoonee pechidiyon kaa taala kuch aisa padaa he ki supreme court ke khole bhi nahin khul rahaa tha
 Therefore, this time the Supreme Court has reprimanded the Maharashtra government, saying that it is better to ask women to work in dance bars
 isi ke saath supreme court ne hukum diya ki dedh sau dance baron main se kam se kam 8 dance baar agle ek hafte ke andar chaalu ho jane chahie
 Until the year of 2005, dance bars used to be a part of Mumbai's life
 lekin isi saal maharashtra vidhaan sabha ne dance baron ke khilaaf kanoon kya paas kiya, achaanak hi tamaam dance baron ke shater gir gaye
 But now the effort is again to re-dance the dance bars
 desh kii sabase oonchi adaalat yani supreme court ko mumbai main dance baron ko phir se chaalu karne kaa hukum die paanch maheene guzar gaye he
 On 26 November 2015, the Supreme Court had ordered the Maharashtra government to allow the dance bars to be opened again while hearing a complaint by the Maharashtra government
 lekin iske baad ye maamla kanoonee pechidagiyon main kuch aisa ulajhaa ki ab tak ek bhi dance baar kaa shater nahin uth sakaa
 In fact, after this order of the Supreme Court, Maharashtra Legislative Assembly came out with a new law with 26 conditions on April 18 on the dance bar
 jisase dance baar ke khulne kaa rasta jaise phir se band ho gaya
 Under the new law made for running dance bars, the government banned the opening of dance bars within 1 km radius of any school-college or temple
 thik isi tarah sarkaar ne dance baar ke tamaam entry eczit point ke saath-saath kichan-koridor jaisi jagahon par sisiviti camere lagane or dance baar main kaam karne vaale tamaam mulajimon kaa purana trek record bairiphai karne jaisi sharten bhi rakhi
 It was also considered necessary to obtain fresh fire safety and other licenses for the dance bar
 yahaan tak ki pehle to dance baar main sharaab parosane par bhi roak laga di gai
 a petition was filed against the conditions The dance bar owners again knocked on the doors of the Supreme Court against the terms of the court
 somvaar ko supreme court ne phir se inhen masalon paramaharashtra sarkaarko nae sire se taakid kii
 The court ruled that several aspects of this law were impractical, out of the 154 applications for licenses so far, out of the 39 short-listed 39 applications, at least 8 were ordered to be issued as a test case within a week
 sadak par bheekh maangane se behatar dance baar main kaam karnacort ne sarkaar ke ravaiye par tippanee karte hue kaha, 'sadak par bheekh maangane or duusare galat tareekon se paise kamaane se behatar he ki koi mahila dance baar main kaam kar le

 ' The Modi government ended three divorces because it molested Muslim women and husbands use three divorces inappropriately
 lekin bijanour ke ek thane kaa aisa maamla saamne aayaa he, jahaan ek bivi ko pehle teen talaak dilaayaa gaya, phir thane main shuhar kishadiuski premika se kara di gai
 However, Raheepulis is seen implicated in this role as a witness of the entire episode
 premi kii shaadi ke baad premika is kadar pagal hui ki usne premi ke ghar jaakar hangaamaa khadaa kar diya, hangaamaa itnaa badha ki maamla thane panhuch gaya
 But the shocking thing was that in this case, the use of triple talaq was unjustified and Auhana became a weapon, where the Panchayat was sitting
 dulhan paksh ko bulaayaa gaya or thane ke bheetar hi samjhauta hua
 Then from within the police station, his bride Kothin was divorced from the young man on the phone and then his marriage with his girlfriend was taught
 premika kaa paagalpan or shaadishuda shaks ke liye uski deewangi dekh dulhan paksh bhi talaak ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 The amount of 35 thousand of Meher was given to the girl in the police station and then she was married in the police station
 dulhan ke parijan bhi isliye bhi taiyaar ho gaye kyonki ladki kii sirf shaadi hui thi, uski vidaai kii rasm abhi baaki thi
 The entire case is related to Baruki village in Bijnor district
 jahaan ek muslim ladki apane premi kii shaadi kisi duusari ladki ke saath ho jane ke baad uske ghar ja panhuchi
 Then she insisted on marrying her lover
 ghar main hangaamaa badha to maamla police thane ja pahunchaa
 The family and policemen had to bow before the insistence of the girl
 thane ke bheetar kaaji bulaae gaye or thane main hi mobile phone par pehle premi se uski nai naveli patni ko teen talaak dilvaaya gaya or phir vahiin premi ke saath us ladki kaa nikaah padhwaaya gaya
 In such a situation, three divorces became a means of finding love for that girl
 hangaame ke baad phone par teen talakthana kotwali dehaat kshetra ke gaanv baruki kaa rahane vaala gulfam gaanv kii ek ladki tarannum se pyaar karata tha
 The family of the boy had decided to marry Gulfam to the girl Sultanate of Haldore police station area
 phir gulfam kii shaadi isi saal 15 july ko sultanate ke saath ho gai
 However, the new bride Sultanate was not given farewell
 ye baat pataa chalate hi gulfam kii premika tarannum somvaar ko achaanak uske ghar pahunch gai or gulfam se nikaah karne kii jid par ad gai
 When there was a ruckus, the police reached the spot
 police premi or ladki ko thane le ai
 There was a ruckus within the police station when the girlfriend made a ruckus and told to eat poison
 phir gharavaale bhi vahaan ja pahunche
 Gulfam divorced his wife, Kotin, over the phone
 sultanate ke ghar vaale thane pahunch chuke the, lihaaja donon pakshon main baatcheet ke baad rakam meher dulhan ke parijanon ko adaa kar di gai
 Then in the presence of the police, the lover and girlfriend's marriage was done by Kazi premises
 thane main nikaah par jaanch ke adeshthane ke bheetar nikaah karaane vaale kaaji mohammad sabir ne kaha ki thane ke bheetar nikaah to padhaa diya gaya, lekin thane ke bheetar nikaah jaij nahin hota he, isliye dobaaraa madrase main bhi is nikaah ko padhaayaa gaya he
 After coming to the notice of divorce case within the police station, the SP of the district has ordered the investigation
 nikaah karaae jane ke baad us ladke ko dobaaraa thane bulaayaa gaya
 Later, Gulfam said that the divorce took place outside the police station
 is maamle ko lekar thana prabharee ne thane ke andar nikaah karaane kii baat se inkaar kar diya, lekin tasviren or maujuud log is baat kii tasdik kar rahe hai ki thane main talaak or nikaah donon hue hai
 Right now, the top officials are also refraining from speaking on the matter

 Has the government and the GST Council reduced tax rates on hundreds of goods by reducing the prices of daily use of consumers? The answer is no, according to the feedback that has come to the government
 vajah he ki badi sankhya main companiyaan or kaarobaar tex ghatane kaa laabh upabhoktaaon ko nahin de rahe hai or atirikt tex ko munaafe kii tarah lekar apni jeb bhar rahe hai
 The Finance Ministry can now take tough measures to curb such a trend

 Till now, the law has a provision to recover Rs 10,000 or whatever tax has been hidden on such violations, both of which are higher
 lekin ye vidhai upachaar karne main abhi thodaa vakt lagegaa kyonki sarkaar kii yojana vitt vidheyak main ye jaruri sanshodhan agle saal ke shuru main laane kii he
 The proposal has received in-principle approval from a panel of several ministries

 Sources say that the government has come to know that companies are giving various excuses for not passing the benefit of tax cuts to consumers
 isse tex katautee ke uddeshy ko hi chot pahunch rahi he
 Since the launch of uniform tax under GST across the country from July 1 last year, the top regulator GST Council has reduced the tax rate on 384 items and 68 services

 The government believes that the central and state governments are losing revenue
 isliye tex daron kii katautee kaa laabh upabhoktaaon ko milanaa chahie naa ki wo companiyon or kaarobaaron kii jebon main munaafe ke taur par jaae
 At the moment, most of such profiteering is out of hold
 kuch maamalon main yaa to shikayaton yaa niyamit nirikshan se paaya gaya ki har company or bijness house ke paas tex katautee kaa laabh upabhoktaaon tak pahunchane main naakaam rahane ke liye koi naa koi bahaanaa he
 Some companies claim that they could not benefit consumers because the cost of manufacturing has gone up
 kuch companiyon ne chaalaaki baratate hue puraa laabh upabhoktaaon tak naa pahunchaa kar uskaa kuch hissaa hi pahunchaaya
 There are also allegations that some companies have slashed prices selectively after tax rates have come down
 companiyon kii ore se apana munafa ooncha rakhane ke liye tarah tarah ke hatkande apanaae ja rahe hai
 Some companies reduced the price of less popular big packs of the product but did not reduce the price on smaller packs of the same product

 maharashtra main shivasena or bijepi ke bich gatirodh aakhirkaar sulajh gaya he
 Shiv Sena will now join the state's KBJP government
 sutron se mil rahi jaankaree ke mutabik, use paanch cabinet mantri pad or 7 rajya mantri pad die ja sakate hai
 According to reports, the post of Deputy Chief Minister will not be given to Shiv Sena
 shivasena ke vidhayak buudhvaar ko mantri pad kii shapath le sakate hai
 However, the final seal of Shiv Sena is yet to be stamped on it
 yaad rahe ki maharashtra chunaav se pehle bijepi or shivasena kaa purana gathbandhan tut gaya tha
 During the election campaign, Shiv Sena used strong words like 'crows of Shraddha' for BJP
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi chunaav prachaar ke dauraan shivasena ko 'haftavsuli party' or ensipi ko 'nachurli karpt party' kaha tha
 But the Fadnavis government in the House won the 'disputed' trust vote with the support of the NCP
 isvishwaas mat ko shivasena ne 'farji' bataaya thaor rajyapal kii gaadi ke aage khub hangaamaa bhi kiya tha
 But after a few high-level meetings, everything is being said right between the BJP and Shiv Sena
 yah sambhavat: pehali baar he ki kisi rajya kaa pramukh vipakshi dal sidhe-sidhe sarkaar main shaamil hone ja rahaa he
 Shiv Sena will not get big portfolios like Home, Housing, Revenue and Energy
 inaki jagah use jal sangrakshan, udyog or peedblyoody jaise vibhaag die ja sakate hai
 The Shiv Sena wanted the Home Department, but could get the post of Minister of State for Home
 khabar yah bhi he ki shivasena ko centre main ek atirikt mantri pad bhi mil saktaa he
 Earlier, the confirmation of the resolution of the conflict between the two parties came at a time when Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Monday that 80 percent of the talks had been done on the matter
 siem ne suzav dete hue kaha tha ki jo log baatcheet se jude hue nahin hai, unhen maamle main kuch nahin bolnaa chahie
 Some cabinet ministers of the Fadnavis government were also present during the meeting between the two parties on Monday
 shivasena netaaon kii fadanvis ke saath ravivaar raat hui mulaakaat se pehle bijepi ke varisht netaa or kendriya mantri dharmedra pradhan, rajya sahakaarita mantri chandrakant patil ne uddhav thakare se kareeb dedh ghante tak baatcheet kii thi, lekin kisi bhi paksh ne aadhikarik rup se kuch nahin kaha
 Apart from this, senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy also met Uddhav Thackeray
 gauratlab he ki shivasena or bhaajapa kii sarkaar pehali baar maharashtra main 1995 main bani thi or us samay shivasena ne manohar joshi ko mukhyamantri banaaya tha, jabaki upmukhyamantri kaa pad bhaajapa ke gopinath munde ko diya gaya tha
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, there was a dispute between the two parties over seats, after which the alliance was broken

 What the Constitution also testifies and this guarantees to the citizens that their rights are not violated in the country

 The group of petitioners also challenged the mandatory use of Aadhaar card as a breach of privacy, as well as expressed concern over data breach

 At the same time, the Center has described privacy as an unknown and latent right, which has denied the right to live, right to shelter, to the poor

 If you go to the shopping market, shopping complex or mall, then a part (section) of the mat and dress required for yoga will be seen separately
 june 2015 se pehle shaayad hi aisi jhalak dekhne ko milti thi
 But last year was going to bring this invaluable gift of India back to the global stage, when the world accepted yoga with open mind and June 21 was declared as International Yoga Day
 aisa pehali baar hua ki sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ne itani teji se bharat ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya or 193 sadsy deshon ne manjuuri di
 a record 177 countries became co-sponsors of Yoga Day
 isse pehle yoga diwas chote paimaane par sahuuliyat ke hisaab se alag-alag tarikhon main kuch yoga guru apni sansthaaon main manaate the
 However, this campaign started on 27 September 2014 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the United Nations General Assembly said, "yoga is an invaluable gift of Indian archaic tradition
 yah sirf vyaayaam bhar nahin balki apane aapse, vishwa or prakruti se tadatmya kaa madhyam he
 Through this, we will be helpful in fighting climate change by changing lifestyle
 aaie, ham antarrashtriya yoga diwas kii disha main aage badhen
 "his appeal had wide impact and on 11 December 2014, the United Nations agreed to India's proposal
 iske baad 21 june 2015 ko duniya bhar main pehla antarrashtriya yoga diwas manaaya gaya
 a grand event was organized at Rajpath in Delhi, the capital of India, where 35,985 people including Prime Minister Modi attended
 84 deshon ke pratinidhi bhi is aayojan ke sakshi bane
 21 Yogasanas were performed in this ceremony lasting 35 minutes at Rajpath
 is aayojan ko giness world records ne do shreniyon main puraskrit bhi kiya
 The Central Council for Yoga and Naturopathy Research has selected ngos across the country for one lakh each
 kii sahaayta di taaki aayojan ko gaanv-gaanv tak pahunchaaya ja sake
 At the end of this year, Google also promoted Yoga Guru in India and the world

 ayangar ko unki jayanti ke maukey par 14 disambar ko apana doodle banaaya
 But there was also a fierce controversy in India, which became the leader of yoga after it was restored globally
 shuruyaat main vivaad patanjali yogapith ke sansthaapak swami ramdev ke rajpath ke kaarykram main bulaae jane ko lekar hua
 However, Ramdev participated in it and he got a place on the stage as well
 modi sarkaar ne ise safal banane ke liye videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj or art of living ke sansthaapak shri shri ravishankar ko america bheja
 But in India, Yoga Day became a religious controversy
 ol india muslim personal lau board ne yoga ke surya namaskara asana kaa virodh karte hue hindu agenda qaraar de diya
 It was also alleged that the Modi government has taken the initiative of International Yoga Day only to further the agenda of the Union
 lekin vivaadon kii vajah se is asana ko samaaroh se baahar rakhaa gaya
 The selection of the date of June 21, just before the grand event of Yoga Day, also raised questions
 aarope lagaae gaye ki modi sarkaar ne sangh ke sansthaapak keshav baliram headgavar ko sammaan dene ke makasad se hi is taarikh ko chunaa he kyonki isi din headgavar kii punya tithi bhi manaai jaati he
 But later it became clear that 21st June is the biggest day of the year, so this date has been chosen for International Yoga Day
 bharat ke liye bhi vidambnaa hi thi ki yoga kaa janmdata desh is maamle main pichhadaa hua tha, jabaki america main yoga kaa kaarobaar 27 arab dollar kaa ho chukaa he
 Now India is moving ahead in realizing the vision of a healthy India and giving it the shape of an industry
 yoga ke safal aayojan ke agle din hi kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ne yoga ko chhathi kaksha se schuli paathyakram main shaamil kiye jane kaa elaan kar diya
 On behalf of the government, Union Minister of AYUSH Shripad Naik expressed his motive, ‚Äúthis is a beginning towards universal health care
 agar ham yoga ko thik tareeke se jan-jan tak le ja saken to hamaara swasthya bajet bhi kam ho jayega
 ‚Äúthat is, in 2016, the government is moving towards making it more comprehensive
 desh main chah kendriya santhaan bhi sthapit ho rahe hai, jinhen antarrashtriya sansthaaon se jodgaye kii pahal chal rahi he
 If the past year was going to bring yoga into the mainstream, in the coming year 2016, India will also develop into a yoga industry which will increase trained and skilled man power and create new employment opportunities

 vahiin, shaam tak ek or badi karrwai karte hue ayog ne sapa netaa ajam khan or kendriya mantri va bijepi netaa menka gandhi ke chunaav prachaar par roak laga di
 While the campaigning of Azam Khan has been banned for 72 hours, the campaigning for 48 hours has been banned for making controversial statements on Maneka Gandhi
 in donon netaaon par yah pratibandh 16 april subah 10 baje se lagu hoga
 During this time, they will not be able to do any kind of election rallies

 bataa den ki rampur seat se bhartiya janata party kii pratyaashee jaya pradaa hai
 At the same time, Union Minister Maneka Gandhi made a controversial statement during the election rally in Sultanpur
 unhone kaha tha ki jis ilaake se unhen sabase zyada vot milenge, sabase pehle usee kaa kaam hoga
 Apart from this, in another rally, Maneka made controversial remarks about Muslim society

 Addressing the rally, Mayawati had said that the people of the Muslim community should not let their votes be divided, only vote for the grand alliance
 vahiin, uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne apane ek sambodhan main mayawati par hamalaa karte hue kaha tha ki agar vipaksh ko ali pasand he, to hamen bajrang bali pasand hai
 The Supreme Court had rebuked that on Monday morning, the Supreme Court had objected to the inflammatory speech given at Mayawati's Deoband rally

 The court said that till now the commission is issuing only notice, take strict action

 supreme court main argedy supremeo lalu prasad kii ore se kapil sibbal ne daleel di ki unako di gai sajaa alag-alag chal rahi hai, jabaki court ke faisle ke mutabik bhi aparaadh ek hi he
 Hence punishment should also go together
 is par supreme court ne kaha ki vah is maamle main merit par sunwaayee nahin karegaa
 The High Court will hear this
 chif justise ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki lalu prasad yadav kai maamalon main doshi hai
 In all the cases, the High Court will consider whether the sentence should go together or separately
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki lalu prasad yadav ke jail se baahar nikalne se kisi ko koi khatra nahin he
 To this, the apex court said that there is no danger, but Lalu Prasad Yadav is a punishment
 vahiin, lalu yadav kii arji khaarij hone ke baad argedy saansad manoj jha ne kaha ki lalu prasad kii tabiyat thik nahin he, unhen behatar medical care kii jarurat he

 unke bade bete tej pratap ne rajd ke khilaaf hi morcha khol diya he or lalu rabari morcha banaakar do jagahon se ummidavaar utaarne kii baat kar rahe hai
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is now in the NDA
 rajd ke paas koi aisa netaa nahin he ki vah bijepi or jadyu ko us tarah se gher sake jaise lalu gherte hai
 His sons are working hard but the people of Bihar are missing Lalu's speeches

 The CBI in its reply said that the petitioner (lalu Yadav) has not only been given a special ward with all facilities during the period of his stay in the hospital but in a way he is running political activities from there, from the list of those who met him is clear
 sibiai ne kaha ki lalu yadav itnaa adhik biimaar hone kaa daawa karte hai ki vah jail main nahin rah sakate or unhen aspataal main bhartee hone kii aavashyaktaa he
 Then suddenly he is fully recovered physically and wants bail
 sibiai ne aage kaha ki lalu prasad chaar maamalon main doshi tehraaya gaya he or unhen 168 maheene kii sajaa hui he
 Of this, he has just completed a sentence of only 20 months, which is less than 15 percent of the sentence he has been sentenced
 sibiai ne kaha ki is tarah lalu yadav ke apane hi kathan ke mutabik vah sajaa ke nilamban or jamaanat ke liye ‚Äòaadhi sajaa puri karne ke siddhant‚Äôko puraa nahin karte hai
 The RJD chief challenged the January 10 order of the Jharkhand High Court dismissing his bail plea in the apex court
 bataa den ki lalu prasad ko 900 karod rupee se adhik ke chaara ghotaale se sambandhit teen maamalon main doshi tehraaya gaya he

 But do you know that Krishna has another name besides all these names, which you will be surprised to hear
 ji haa or wo naam he ranchhod
 Yes, there was a time in the life of Shri Krishna when he realized his goodness in not leaving his ground without confronting his enemy
 aap soch rahe honge mahabharat jaisaa yuddh pandavon ko jitaane vaale shrikrishna bhala ranchhod kaise ho sakate hai
 Let us know why Shri Krishna, who preached the Gita to the world, is also called by the name Ranchod
 yah ghatana tab kii he jab mahabali magadharaj jaraasandh ne krishna ko yuddh ke liye lalakaara tha
 Jarasandha had also convinced a king named Kaal Yavan to go to war with Krishna
 darasal, kaal yavan ko bhagwaan shankar ne vardaan diya tha ki naa to chandravanshi or na hi suryavanshi uskaa kabhi kuch bigaad paaenge
 No weapon can be scrapped by him nor can anyone beat him with his force
 bhagwaan shankar se mili vardaan ke baad kaalyavan ne khud ko ajey samaj liya tha
 At the behest of Jarasandha, Kalayavan invaded Mathura without any enmity
 bhagwaan krishna jaanate the ki kaalyavan ko maaraa nahin ja saktaa
 His beauty cannot spoil Kalayavan
 jiske baad wo ranbhumi se bhagkar ek gupha main pahunch gaye
 Seeing Shri Krishna and Balarama running away, Jarasandha started laughing at them
 use bhagavan shrikrishna or balraamji ke aishwarya, prabhaav aadi kaa gyaan na tha
 Shri Krishna ran away from this war and hid in the same cave where King Muchkund was sleeping with Tretayuga after fighting with the demons
 raja muchkund daanvon ko haraane ke baad bahut thak gaye the
 In return, Indra gave him a boon, urging him to rest
 indra ne kaha ki jo bhi insaan tumhen neend se jagayegaa wo jalakar khaak ho jayega
 Shri Krishna knew this very well
 bhagwaan krishna kaal yavan ko apane peeche bhagaate bhagaate us gupha tak le aae
 Where King Muchkund was sleeping
 gupha main bhagwaan krishna ne raja muchkund ke upar apana peetaambar daal diya
 Kalayavan felt that Shri Krishna was afraid and slept in a dark cave
 kaalyavan ne jaise hi treta yug se soe hue raja muchkund ko laat markar uthaaya

 lekin modi ko chunauti dene ke liye congress adhyaksh ko abhi lanbaa rasta tay karnaa hoga kyonki 53 pratishat uttardaataaon ke liye modi pehali pasand hai
 The difference between the two is even greater in the northern region where 60 percent of the respondents voted in favor of Modi and only 13 percent in favor of Rahul

 emasi or vammorcha, sapa or basapa, diemke or eiediemke ko ek chhatari ke neeche laana tedi kheer sabit hogi
 Apart from this, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's ambition to become Prime Minister will also prove to be a hindrance in forming such an alliance
 lekin rahul ke liye yah santvanaa kii baat ho sakati he ki 45 pratishat uttardaataaon ne unhen modi kaa sabase acha vikalp bataaya he jabaki keval 9 pratishat uttardaataaon ne mamata kaa samarthan kiya he
 The encouraging thing for the Congress is that Modi's popularity as the Prime Minister's choice has dropped by 12 percent in the last year
 lekin congress ke liye yah zyada khushi kii baat nahin he jo is samay keval paanch rajyon main satta main he jabaki bhaajapa 19 rajyon main satta main he
 The Congress is also in danger of another state coming out because two more states under its rule - Meghalaya and Karnataka - are going to polls this year
 haalanki, congress ke netaaon ko puraa yakeen he ki ve na sirf in do rajyon main satta barkaraar rakhenge balki un teen rajyon‚Äîmadhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh-main bhi bhaajapa se satta chin lenge jahaan is saal chunaav hone vaale hai
 Rajya Sabha MP Ahmed Patel says, "rahul's election as president has brought new strength in the cadres of the party
" is baat ne yuva netaaon ko jimmaa sanbhaalane ke liye utsahit kar diya he
 "rahul's good relationships with Sonia Gandhi's retirement and his trusted aides like Patel have made him an almost unanimous choice for the prime minister's post ‚Äî 54 percent see him as the best leader of the Congress for the post of prime minister
 yah ek badi oochaal he kyonki agast 2017 main keval 25 pratishat uttardaataaon ne unka samarthan kiya tha
 This perhaps also shows the courage of the newly elected party president to take risks, even if it is a matter of deviating from the party's traditional stance
 bhaajapa kii chhavi hinduon kii party ke taur par banane se chintit congress bhi kuch samay se khud ko gandhivadi siddhanton or samaveshi vichaardhaara ke saath hinduvadi party ke taur par pesh karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 That is why Rahul Gandhi, who describes himself as a worshiper of Shiva, visited 25 temples during the Gujarat election campaign, which not only increased the number of Congress seats to 16, but the party also gave the BJP a double-digit vote for the first time in two decades
 Stopped at the figure
 desh kaa mizaaj surveykshan main bhi yah baat dekhne ko mili kyonki 47 pratishat uttardaataaon ne sweekaar kiya ki rahul ke mandir jane se hindutv par bhaajapa ke ekadhikaar ko chunauti mili he
 On the other hand, 48 percent of Muslim respondents also want to see Rahul as the next Prime Minister while only 19 percent of Muslim voters support Modi as Prime Minister

 essi / asti kanoon ke tahat barmer kepatrkaarkopatnaki ek adaalat ne jail bhej diya
 In this case, the complainant says that he has not registered any case but the Patna court issued a warrant for arrest and the police sent the journalist Kogirattarkar to judicial custody for 4 days
 rajasthan ke barmer ke patrkaar durg singh raajpurohit pichley 18 varshon se patrakarita ke kshetra main hai
 He says that if he never went to Bihar, then how was a case registered against him under the Scheduled Caste Tribe Act and sent him to jail
 mana ja rahaa he ki is maamle main unhen kisi raajnneethiksajishke tahat shikaar banaaya gaya he jiskaa khulaasa hona abhi baaki he

 mangalvaar ko unhen court main pesh kiya gaya jahaan unhen jail bhej diya gaya
 Durg Singh said that he did not know anything about this case, when he brought Rajasthan Police to Patna, he came to know that a person has made a SC / ST case against him
 jisamen kaha gaya ki 'main (durg singh) gitti baaluu kaa kaam karata hum jabaki main to pichley 18 varshon se patrakarita ke kaam main hum or iske alaava maine kuch nahin kiya
 i am being implicated under a political conspiracy
 'durg singh ke khilaaf 31 may ko cese darj karavaaya gaya, jise nalanda ke rakesh paswan naam ke vyakti ne darj karavaaya he
 In this, Durg Singh has been accused of taking him (rakesh Paswan) to Barmer for wages 6 months ago, where he got the stone mined from him but did not pay the money

 rail mantri lalu yadav ne desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main girjagharon ou isaayiyon par ho rahe hamale ke maddenjar bajrang dal par tatkaal pratibandh lagane kii maang kii he
 He called the Bharatiya Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal the power to break the country
 lalu ne kaha ki hindu vot batorne ke liye sangh parivaar or bhaajapa ke log urisa, karnataka or chhattisgarh sahit puure desh main dange karana chaahate hai
 He said that continuous attacks on Christians are bringing infamy to India all over the world
 shanivaar ko vinndhachal parvat par vindhvasini devi ke darshan ke baad patrakaron se baatcheet main unhone kaha ki jo bhi desh kii ekta ko todane kaa kaam karegaa use unki party or sarkaar kii taraf se karaara jawaab diya jayega
 The old building of our government system has undoubtedly collapsed and fluttering is seen everywhere to get out of its rubble, but some optimists among us expect a new and fresh model of functioning to emerge
 ummid yah bhi he ki hamaare afasarshah is badlaav main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayenge, jo hamaari prashasnic mashinari ke ahm ang hai
 But to bring about change, officers will have to mold themselves according to the present times and prove themselves better
 aisi sambhaavna bhi badastoor dikh rahi he or isamen paryaapt gambhirtha ke sanket bhi mil rahe hai lekin maujuuda vakt ke prashasnic nae chamakate sitaron se puraane afasarshahon (jaise 1990 ke aasapaas) kii tulana karnaa gaiyr-munasib nahin hoga, balki isse nae tathyon par roshni padegi
 It would also not be unfair to claim that it was a duty for the old bureaucrats, not just a job
 bharat jaise vikasshil desh main yah saamaajik or naitik daayitv ban jaataa he ki samaaj ke un tabakon kaa hameshaa khyaal rakhaa jaae, jinhen madad kii sakht jarurat he or jahaan jaruri ho, fouran hastkshep kiya jaae‚Äîor yah kaam vahi kar saktaa he jo is peshey ko apana kartavya maanata ho
 Senior officials of the 1990s were treated as if they were a molar of wisdom in the beginning, because then the prime minister of the administrative service was a commitment to the public interest
 aaj, kisi sabase patibaddh or jimmedaar dikhne vaale noujvaan afasar se iskaa zikr bhi kiijie to vah kandhaa uchakaane lagata he
 It was not at all that the old officers were saints and they did not have any sense of selfishness
 fark bas yah tha ki ve is nazariye ko aatmsaat kar chuke the ki prashasnic seva kaa moolmantra janhit hi hota he
 There is no doubt that the 2014 political mandate is for a neo-liberal development model
 is sidghant ke tahat bhi kai tarah ke vikalp aajamaae ja sakate hai
 But such options will have to be tested for the public interest of young officers
 mujhe rashtriya prashasnic academy se alag hue kareeb aadhi sadi biit gai he lekan vahaan ke yuva probationurs se main aagrah karuunga ki ve prashasnic seva ke moolmantra-janhit ke prati aasthaa-ko nae sire se ijad karen
 Keeping pace with the global outlook of today's government, officers should analyze various issues and offer only such options in which maximum public interest is taken care of
 janhit mote taur par raajnneeti nirpeksh hota he, basharte uski vyakhya galat-shalat dhang se na kii jaae
 This advice to young probationers does not mean that they should take up arms and go out for a revolution
 sarkaar kii ek rajnatik vichaardhaara hoti he or chunavi janadesh use yah haq detaa he ki vah us par amal kare
 However, only a small part of the administrative system is driven by ideology ‚Äî apart from that there is considerable scope to formulate policies, plans and programs in which public interest can be taken care of as much as possible
 aaj ke prashasnic seva ke adhikariyon ko 1990 ke dashak ke varisht adhikariyon ke mukaable behatar prashikshan hasil he
 Many young officers also use their skills quite effectively in the work assigned to them
 haalanki, hamaare jaise puraane logon ke liye to adhikariyon kii in do peedhishon ke bich fark tab spasht hota he jab praathamiktaayen tay kii jaati hai or saamaajik str par vikalpon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 One aspect of the governance of the public interest to the public interest seems to be that the social sector (issues like primary healthcare, primary education, minimum nutrition, women and child development, socio-economic upliftment of the weaker sections) is out of its purview
 yuvaaon ne, kam se kam jo iees bane hai, apane kareer ke shuruaati varshon main baari abhaav jarur jhela hoga
 Our talented young probationers must have realized that there is a huge gap between our development strategy and the needs of large sections of the population
 aaj sarkaar vyapaar or corporate jagat ko bahut mahatv de rahi he
 Their needs and attitudes are given considerable space in the formulation of policies
 vanchit tabake ko koi pratinidhitiv hi nahin mil paata
 If an administrative officer follows his religion in the public interest, he will also have to take steps that give such people a place in policies which are not represented
 hamen aisa sunne main aa rahaa he ki yuva afasar technology or aadhunik kaarobaari dastur se chaundhiyaae hue hai kyonki ise hi tarakkee kaa maanak maan liya gaya he
 We believe that maximum economic growth is necessary to make the country a global superpower
 lekin prashasnic seva ke hamaare yuva doston ko yah bhi talashna chahie ki aakhir ve janhit kaa isamen samavesh kaise kar sakate hai
 It is also worth noting that where there is an abundance of scams, loyalty and honesty become important qualities for the officers of the administrative service
 puraane prashasnic apane daur ke spasht mulya vidhaan ke kaayal hua karte the
 For him, loyalty, especially financial honesty, was of paramount importance
 yah bhi gauratlab he ki 1990 ke dashak main vittiya kadachaar ke maukey aaj kii tulana main naganya the
 Today there are a large number of government deals that are highly questionable - some include intangible assets which do not have market transactions to determine the price and many of the sales are at such prices Is done arbitrarily
 aisi paristhitiyon main prashasnic kaary or jatil ho gaye hai
 However, for those who intend, there are also opportunities to gain additional legal advantages
 isse inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki vittiya aparaadh ke udhaaharan ab iffraat main milane lage hai
 We must accept this truth, although many of us deny it and consider 'lack of honesty' as a lousy word that should never be brought to the tongue
 isliye prashasnic seva ke adhikariyon kii maujuuda peedi ko yah tay karnaa hoga ki aaj ke shashan ke aise kaaphi jatil tantra main kaam karne ke liye kin taur-tareekon or prakriyaaon kaa istemaal kiya jaae, taaki sharmnaak aniyamitata se uth rahe saarvajanik vivaadon ke bagaiyr nattejey kis tarah se die ja saken
 Receive credit once again
 It cannot be denied that the credibility of the administrative service has gone down
 saakh kathor saakshyon ke alaava dharanaon se bhi hasil kii ja sakati he yaa ganvaai ja sakati he
 Today, trust in the bureaucracy is constantly declining
 kareeb aadha sadi pehle ek yuva afasar ke rup main main aksar awak rah jaataa tha, yah dekhakar ki meri nekaniyati par kitna bharosa kiya ja rahaa he, jabaki kai betuke nirnay shaayad maine jaldbaaji or ati aatmavishvaas main liye honge
 On the contrary, even today the right decision, which is taken for the good of society, can be challenged due to some personal interests or due to nepotism
 saamaanya nagarikon ne adhikariyon ko jo bina shart bharose kii nidhi uphaar main di thi, use barbaad karke ve apni hi daal kaat rahe hai
 No major management skills are required to win the trust of the people
 samvednaa, nishpakshta or sabake liye samaan ravaie jaise saamaanya gunon se hi samaaj kaa har vyakti sahaj or sukhad mahasoos karne lagata he
 With the business model being the only mantra, such a general attitude is also becoming irrelevant
 aaj, saarvajanik len-dein main koi bhi kisi par bharosa nahin karata
 Officers of the older generation of the 1990s and earlier were gifted credit from the people of the country and used it for good
 yuva afasaron ko ise phir hasil karnaa hoga, bhale hi isamen kitna bhi samay or prayaas kyon na lagaana pade
 i can guarantee that they will find this to be the best investment in their professional careers
 to, ek puraani peedi ke adhikari kaa yuva adhikariyon ke naam yah upadesh ab yaheen khatm ho janaa chahie
 i have no intention of giving the decree
 nihsandeh, har peedi apni paristhitiyon ke mutabik apni peshewar shakhsiyat ko taiyaar karti he
 But this elderly, having seen all the time, risks suggesting that the permanent core values mentioned above will remain relevant under any circumstances, at any age
 (javid choudhary sevanivrutt iees adhikari hai) As soon as the Parliament session began on Monday, the opposition tried to surround the government over the Punjab National Bank (PNB) Mahaghotale

 The Prime Minister was not able to bring back even a new black money from abroad, but i certainly congratulate those who have been successful in sending the country's white money, which was white money, out of India

 Bank scams are happening one after the other
 desh kaa jo hajaaron karod safed paisa he, jo logon kaa paisa he, videsh main ja rahaa he or sarkaar ise rokane asafal rahi he
 What is the benefit of public fame abroad, Azad said that the Prime Minister travels so much abroad
 bijepi kahati he ki bhartiya pradhanmantri videsh main kaaphi lokapriy hai
 If despite such popularity abroad you are not able to catch four people, then what is the benefit of popularity
 desh ko kya phayda
 This is not our demand, but the demand of the people of the country

 amritsar main ek mahila kii usee ke pati ne isliye hatya kar di kyonki usne teesri baar ek ladki janm diya
 According to the information, 35-year-old Paramjit Kaur's husband Nishan Singh was very upset with the first two daughters

 The panchayat also tried to convince Nishan Singh that giving the boy was in the hands of the one above

 Meerut, known for India's first freedom struggle, is the second largest in the national capital region and the major city of western Uttar Pradesh
 dilli, noida, faridabad, gajiabad, haridwar se sugamawa se jude is shahar se teen rashtriya rajmarg guzarate hai
 Meerut is now moving away from planned development for a long time
 haridwar road par new meerut viksit ho rahaa he jahaan supertech, ansal jaisi badi real estate companiyaan pahunch chuki hai
 On entering Meerut, a new mall which has started two months ago, is enhancing the pride of the city
 meerut vikaas praadhikaran ke vaais chairman satyendra kumaar singh (ab dm banda ke pad par tabadalaa ho chukaa) kehete hai, ‚Äò‚Äòsanchaar or parivahan vyavastha ko durust kar hamaari koshish meerut ko dilli kii satellite city banane kii he
 "they say that the biggest feature of this city is the sweet water coming from the ground and the ground water level is very high, so this city attracts people
" satyendra kumaar singh ke mutabik, parivahan vyavastha behatar nahin hone kii vajah se is mahanagar ke vikaas main baadhaaen aa rahi hai
 But the meerut-delhi Rapid Rail Transit System (RRTS) study report (DPR) was ready
 jisamen haive ke bich main se iskaa allinment banaaya gaya tha
 But the National Highways Authority did not approve it, so work is being done on the plan afresh
 iske alaava mahanagar main awajahi ko aasaan banane ke liye 100 acre jameen kaa adhigrahan kar ring road banaaya ja rahaa he
 Funds have been released by MDA for the first phase
 kareeb 15,000 haivi gadipoon ke liye bagpat road par paanchali gaanv main alag se transport nagar basaaya ja rahaa he
 Airport is proposed in Paratapur, as soon as it is built, the pace of development of Meerut with all types of industry will increase

 satyendra kumaar singh bataate hai ki yahaan kii aabaadi main 10 lakh kaa utaar-chadhaav inhen shramikon kii vajah se hota rahata he
 The bullion of Meerut is the number one business market in Asia, so there is no match in the manufacture of sports, scissors and instruments
 duniya ke adhikansh cricketer yahaan ke bane ballon se khelte hai to koi bhi olympic yahaan bani khel saamagree ke bina puraa nahin hota
 Various brands like Stag International, Nalco, Bhalla International, SS, SG are present here in the sports industry
 yahaan kii paaramparik kanchi aaj bhi saat samandar paar jaati he
 Jewelery made of this city is also famous all over the world
 udyogpuram or partapur, meerut kaa mukhya audyogic kshetra he
 Due to ganga-yamuna being in the Doab region, Meerut's agricultural land is fertile, so it has become an education hub of the state and especially western UP due to four big universities and technical institutes
 choudhary charan singh uniwarsity, sardaar vallabh bhai patel krishi evam praudyogiki vivi, shobhit uniwarsity, subharti uniwarsity is shahar ke kaushal nirmaan main apana ahm yogadan de rahi he

 Despite this, the Nauchandi Fair, a symbol of hindu-muslim unity and the urge to grow with the entrepreneurship of the people, is pushing the city forward

 Its biggest strength has been the establishment of the bullion to education hub

 Lack of planned development and stifling traffic system in the city is its biggest weakness

 The 151st meeting of the Academic Council (AC) is going to take place on June 28 at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)
 jeenyu student union kaa kahana he ki baithak main hindi ko lekar faisla hone ja rahaa he, jo student ke hit main nahin he
 Why is there a controversy over Hindi language in JNU, this is the whole matter, JNU Students' Union president n Sai Balaji says that JNU administration is going to make Hindi mandatory in the graduation program in the academic council meeting to be held on June 28 
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki iske peeche jeenyu prashasan sarkaar or rashtriya swayan sevak kaa chipa hua agenda hindi, hindu, hindustan lagu karnaa chaahati he
 He has cited an official letter issued by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) to all universities in 2018, outlining Hindi as the national language
 iske alaava hindi ko sabhi snaatak str ke kaaryakramon main anivaary paathyakram ke rup main lagu karne ke nirdesh die hai
 This is the letter given by the JNU student, whose agenda was given in the Agenda 16 of the ACAC meeting, in which the subject of the pointless dispute was said by the JNUSU President, no one national language of the country, the Student Union says that there is no single national language in India
 desh ke samvidhan kii aathvin anusuchee desh kii vividh or bahuaiami prakruti ke anusaar 22 aadhikarik bhashaaon ko soochibaddh karti he
 Balaji has accused the JNU Vice Chancellor of forcibly planning to impose the Hindi language
 bala ji ne kaha ki aaj jab sarkaar aam janata ke dabaav main apni draft shiksha niti or 3 bhashaa formule ko sanshodhit karne par majaboor he, aise main jeenyu kulapati dwaara hindi ko anivaary karnaa nindaneey he
 He said that everyone has the right to learn the language of their choice
 is desh main koi bhi bhashaa kisi anya se upar nahin he
 Students should be given the option to learn
 unhone kaha ki chaatro par bhashaa ko lekar kisi bhi tarah kaa dabaav bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 He said that JNUSU opposes forcibly imposing Hindi
 saath hi ham kulapati se maang karte hai ki wo baithak kaa agenda 16 drop karen jo snaatak str par hindi ko anivaary banane kii vakaalat karata he
 If it is forcibly imposed then JNUS will peacefully protest against it
 philhal is maamle main abhi tak jeenyu prashasan kii ore se koi bhi paksh nahin rakhaa gaya he
 Facebook is set to become youtube and soon Google's video website surpasses youtube, it will not be a surprise
 aisa isliye, kyonki fasebuk ne pichley kuch saalon se utyub kaa taabut banaan shuru kar diya he
 We tell you a few points one by one, which will give you an idea of how Facebook is preparing to compete with youtube
 dhyaan dijie, duniya kii sabase badi soshal netwarking website fasebuk kai celibrities ko video content ke liye karodo rupee detii he
 According to the Wall Street Journal, the company will spend about $ 50 million for live videos by next year
 fasebuk duniya bhar ke media house or publications se zyada se zyada video content daalane ko kah rahi he
 They are also being given money for this
 utyub video nahin balki diarect fasebuk par video aplod
 Whether the video is in the form of Facebook Live or uploaded direct
 lagaataar company video se jude nae fitures launch kar rahi he
 Now you will get videos of all categories like youtube on Facebook
 veryphid pejon par zyada behatar tareeke kii category dikhegi, or aisa lagegaa jaise ye video kii hi website he
 Recently Facebook has also introduced auto play video feature which is causing trouble for people
 jaise hi news feed scrol karenge video start ho jate hai
 This gives the company a direct benefit, because obviously the hits will also be found
 haalanki settings se ise band kiya ja saktaa he, lekin phir bhi difolt taur par auto play hota he or kai yugers ise samaj nahin pate
 Facebook has already launched virtual reality and 3d-based video features, clearing the way forward
 ab aankadon par dhyaan den to yah paaenge ki kaise fasebuk par video contents fal phool rahe hai
 Facebook has a 94 percent increase in video viewers in the US, while growing at a rate of 74 percent worldwide
 fasebuk ke mutabik log yahaan ek din main 1 billianvidios dekhte hai or americake 76 fisadi log video dhughane ke liye fasebuk yuj karte hai
 Now when people started coming on Facebook to find videos, you can guess what will happen to youtube
 aisa karne ke peeche company kaa sabase bada makasad jaahir he paisa kamanaa he
 But youtube is in front of it and Facebook is aware that youtube cannot be suddenly defeated by any video feature
 isliye company lambey samay se yah kaam dhire dhire kar rahi he, or ab asar bhi dikh rahaa he

 Ever since the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, a round of rhetoric continues regarding Pakistan Occupied Kashmir
 is bich kendriya mantri or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke 'fire brands' netaa giriraaj singh ne ishaaron hi ishaaron main kashmir ke us paar jane kii baat kii he
 Giriraj, one of the people who often make statements about Pakistan, has given a new slogan in a tweet on Tuesday
 unhone likhaa, 'jai kashmir, jai bharat, abaki baar us paar
 There is speculation about this tweet that he is talking about Pakistani-occupied Kashmir
 giriraaj singh ke is twit ko lekar vipaksh partiyon ne un par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 The Congress and RJD targeted him and said that who has stopped you from crossing the border? News agency IANS quoted Congress leader Premchand Mishra as saying, "giriraj Singh is making statements on pok these days only to mislead people
" agar unke paas himmat he, to unhen or centre sarkaar ko koun roak rahaa he? niyantran rekha paar karne or pioke par kabja karne ke faisle ke liye koun roak rahaa he?'inke alaava rajd vidhayak vijay prakaash yadav ne giriraaj singh ko chunauti di he
 He said, 'why does Giriraj Singh only speak about pok and keep quiet on China? It is part of their politics to polarize
 ' saath hi unhone kaha ki yah tippanee khabaron main jagah paane ke liye karte hai
 Let me tell you that even before this, Giriraj Singh had expressed happiness over the abolition of Article 370 and said that the dream of a united India would be fulfilled only after Pakistan-occupied Kashmir was included in the country
 inase pehle rakshaamantri rajnath singh ne kaha tha ki agar pakistan se baatcheet hogi to keval pakistani kabje vaale kashmir par hogi

 The Supreme Court has refused to stay the order on the Bombay High Court order banning the sale of meat in Mumbai
 supreme court ne hycourt se 6 maheene main maamla nipataane ko kaha
 In fact, Shri Tapagachia Atma Kamal Labdhisurishwarji Gyanamandir Trust had demanded a stay on the Bombay High Court order
 tippaniyan It is noteworthy that the mutton traders had approached the Bombay High Court against the Jain community's four-day ban on Paryushan festival
 pichley hafte virodh or naaraazgi ke bich meet par bain ko chaar din se ghataakar sirf ek din 17 sitambar ke liye kar diya gaya tha
 The High Court said last week that Mumbai is a metropolitan city
 maance kii bikri par is tarah kaa sidhaa pratibandh formula nahin ho saktaa
 What about packaged meat, which is already available in the market
 is bain kaa vipaksh hi nahin, sattadhari bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena ne bhi virodh kiya tha
 Apart from the opposition Congress and NCP, bjp's ally Shiv Sena alleged that the BJP is trying to appease the Jain community keeping in mind the 2017 local body elections
 paryushan ke dauraan meet par bain 1994 main shuru hua tha or us samay congress kii sarkaar thi
 Officials said that after 10 years, the two-day ban was increased to four days, but in reality it was never implemented
 ullekhneey he ki jain samudaay ke paryushan parv ko lekar meet par chaar din ke bain ke khilaaf matan kaarobaariyon ne bambe hoicourt kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 Last week, amid protests and outrage, the ban on meat was reduced from four days to just one day, 17 September
 hoicourt ne pichley hafte kaha tha ki mumbai ek metropolitan shahar he
 Formula cannot be such a direct restriction on the sale of meat
 packaged meet ke bare main kya he, jo pehle se hi bazaar main uplabdh he
 The ban was opposed not only by the opposition but also by the Shiv Sena, an ally of the ruling BJP
 vipakshi congress or ensipi ke alaava bijepi kii sahyogi shivasena ne aarope lagaaya ki 2017 ke sthaneey nikaay chunaavon ko dhyaan main rakhkar bijepi jain samudaay kii tushtikaran kii koshish kar rahi he
 The ban on meat began during 1994 and the Congress was in government at that time
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki 10 saal baad do din ke bain ko badhaakar chaar din kar diya gaya tha, lekin asal main ise kabhi lagu nahin kiya gaya

 " This may sound a bit strange to hear, but the reality is that China is making great preparations for 'ideological' movement in India
 iske liechin ne bharat se sateenepal or bhutan kii simaaon ke paas chalis se zyada buddha math or adhyan kendra bana liye hai
 And more such centers are being built
 inkaa istemaal vahbharat virdohi prachaar abhiyanonko puraa karne ke liye karnaa chahta he
 Indian intelligence agencies have given this news to the government
 bada sawaal ye he ki kya bharat is hamale ke liye taiyaar he?china ne apane makasad ko puraa karne ke liye adhyayan centre or buddha mathon kii suraksha kaa jimmaa pipuls libration army ko diya he
 Which has infiltrated the icy border of Ladakh several times
 bhartiya seemaa par tainaat sashastr seemaa bal or sarkaar kii pareshaani china kii is chaal se bad gai he
 Actually, the army and the BSF can stop infiltration, respond to bullet by bullet, but ideologically it does not seem easy to deal with these centers and monasteries which are propagating against India
 china kii nai ranneeti kaaphi sochi samajhi he
 Even on the international stage, India cannot oppose these monasteries and centers
 or agar bharat virodh karegaa to use in kendron or mathon ke khilaaf pukhta saboot bhi jutaney honge
 This move of China in the name of religion can prove to be harmful for India
 do saal pehle dilli main pakade gaye do naksaliyon ne china kii yojana kaa khulaasa bhi kiya tha ki china aise logon kii talash main rahata he jo bharat main rahakar uski vichaardhaara ko apanaaen or bharat ke khilaaf uske kaam aaen
 a similar report of China was revealed in an intelligence report of the Home Ministry in 2011
 report ke mutabik manipur ke 7 maiti vidrohi guton ne naga vidrohi gut enessien (ke) ke saath milakar ek bharat-virdohi sanyukt morcha banaaya tha
 Which was supported by China
 report main kaha gaya tha ki bangladesh main sakriy bharat virdohi guton se china kaa sampark ho gaya he
 With his help, these groups have migrated from Bangladesh to Myanmar
 haal hausam main katl-e-aam karne vaale neshnal democratic front of bodoland kaa ek gut bhi myanmar main chini agenciyon kii madad se prashikshan kendra chalaa rahaa he
 The banned Communist Party of India (mao) is seeking to strengthen its roots in Assam with the help of China
 bharat kii lagbhag chalis fisadi aabaadi ko prabhavit karne vaale naksali bhi china se madad paa rahe hai
 Now China is upset with the announcement of two thousand kilometers of road and 54 new security checkpoints in Arunachal Pradesh
 usne is par aapatti bhi darj karai thi
 But the Indian government made it clear that it would complete its work
 naaraaz china ne bharat ko chetavanee bhi di
 And there was also talk of increasing border dispute
 jab uski chetavanee kaa bharat par koi asar nahin hua
 This latest disclosure about China is only part of its 60-year-old anti-india crafty strategy
