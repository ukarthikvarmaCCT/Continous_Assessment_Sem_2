 ' shahrukh ne kaha, ' main chahta hum ki vah us har cheez se gujarey jisase meri sahyogi mahila actor guzarati hai
 My daughter will become an actor like him and i want to feel that pain
 ' Shahrukh said, 'I want him to appear on the cover page of magazines as the rest of my heroines look, dressed in all kinds, sexy and beautiful
 main chahta hum vah aakarshak lage, sundar lage or log uski izzat karen or sabase zyada jaruri main chahta hum vah kathin parishram kare
 There are some days when i do not feel well but Suhana is the reason i wake up and then go to work
 meri sirf ek shart he, vah acting kar sakati he lekin use pehle padhai kerani hogi
 ' bataa den ki shahrukh khan or patni gauri khan ke teen bachche hai jinamein sabase bada betaa aryan (19) filmameking pard rahaa he, suhana (16) or abram (3) hai
 Shahrukh Khan's daughter Suhana is 16 years old and has been seen with him at many places
 suhana ko acting kaa kaaphi shauk he or vah theatre bhi karti he
 However, it does not seem from Shahrukh's talk that Suhana's line of acting is going to be so easy
 shahrukh ne is intervyuu main kaha, 'agar femail actors ke liye chijen nahin badalatin or agar usamen mujhase 5 guna zyada kaam karne kaa junun or jajba he or agar uske baad bhi vah 10 guna kam mehtaane ke saath yah karne ke liye taiyaar he to vah jarur actor ban sakati he
 Shah Rukh said, "I want him to go through everything that my associate lady actor goes through
 meri beti unki hi tarah actor banegi or main vah dard mahasoos karnaa chahta hum
 ' shahrukh ne kaha, ' main chahta hum vah meggenes ke cover pej par dikhaai de jaise baaki kii meri hiroins dikhti hai, har tarah ke kapade pahane, sexi or khubasurat lage
 i want him to look attractive, look beautiful and people respect him and most of all i want him to work hard
 kuch din aise bhi hote hai jab main acha mahasoos nahin karata hum lekin suhana hi vah kaaran he jise dekhakar main uthta hum or phir kaam par jaataa hum
 i have only one condition, she can act but she will have to study first
 ' Shahrukh Khan and wife Gauri Khan have three children, the eldest son Aryan (19) studying filmmaking, Suhana (16) and Abram (3)
 bataa den ki shahrukh khan or patni gauri khan ke teen bachche hai jinamein sabase bada betaa aryan (19) filmameking pard rahaa he, suhana (16) or abram (3) hai
 There is nothing impossible in science
 avishkaar or khoj hameshaa nae nateezon ko janm dene vaale rachanaatmak mastishkon kii lagaataar koshishon kaa fal hote hai
 With vibrant imagination and constant effort, the powers of the universe can do meaningful work for the motivated mind
 ham kis tarah atyaadhunik anusandhan kii neenv-bhartiya yuvaaon ke mastishkon ko nai roshni dikhaa sakate hai or bhartiya vigyaan ko navajagaran kii ore le ja sakate hai?hamen rachanaatmak vaigyanikon kii nai peedi kii jarurat he
 For this, we need an environment of research and challenging campaigns
 in sabase upar, shaikshanik sansthaanon ke paas susadgijat prayogshaalaayein or professor hone chahie jinamein yuvaaon ko vigyaan kii ore khinchne kii sthapit kshamta honi chahie
 i have noticed that there is a lack of research culture in Indian universities
 meraa maananaa he ki jahaan acha shodh he, vahaan acchhee padhai ho sakati he; jahaan acchhee padhai hoti he vahaan acha shodh ho saktaa he
 Therefore, i envision our universities as research and learning centers
 iske liye jarurat he ki campus main shodh se jude kuch jane-maane professor hon jisase hoshiyaar chaatro ko khinchaa ja sake
 Such an environment of research will give credibility to the departments of the university, allowing them to get funding from industry and research and development (R&D) laboratories for research programs and projects
 shodh ke laayak maahaul banane ke liye do nobel puraskaar vijetaon ke kadam, jinhone apane anokhe andaaj main anusandhan ko anjaam diya, kaaphi kuch sikhaate hai

 When Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi headed towards Ashok Hall of Rashtrapati Bhavan on October 28, in the morning of the cabinet reshuffle, he did not enter through the main door from where other mps and Ministers go
 ve raashtrapati pranab mukherjee or uparashtrapati hamid ansaari jaise viviypi ke liye bane get se pravesh karte hue sonia gandhi ke peeche kii taraf se aae
 It was the first time that Rahul had used this special entrance
 ve ek sandesh de rahe the: ki ab ve aadhikarik rup se 'diggajon’ main shaamil ho chuke hai
 But this symbolism was not significant
 pherbadal ke baad cabinet main na to khushi manaane jaisi koi baat thi or na hi yah prashasnic sakht jaruraton ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiya gaya yuva aadhaarit punaruddhar tha
 At some point in the next fortnight, Rahul may be crowned as the number two form of the coronation party

 Sonia Gandhi was not with him during this meeting
 lekin pherbadal main jin 22 nae chehron ko shaamil kiya gaya he unamem mushkil se hi koi rahul bigrade kaa he
 Their impact can be seen only in the allocation of some departments (see box)
 manmohan ne ise aam chunaav se pehle 'antim pherbadal’ qaraar diya
 The Prime Minister has tried to balance it

 But some decisions are reassuring
 korporate maamalon ke nae mantri 35 varshiya sachin payalat ne kaarobaar ke liye 'sakasham vaataavaran’ taiyaar karne kii baat kii he
 He said, "we have to keep short and easy laws, which will have heavy penalties for breaking them
 ham bharat main kaarobaar karne ko jatil nahin bana sakate
 40-year-old Jyotiraditya Scindia, the new energy minister, spoke of illuminating rural India

" ambika soni or digvijay jaise anbhavi netaaon ko bhi team rahul main mahatvapurn bhoomika saunpane kaa sanket diya gaya he
 But none of them seems able to deliver what the Congress needs most: the stability of the UPA
 iske sabase bade sahyogi dal diemke ne cabinet pherbadal samaaroh kaa bahishkaar kiya or apni teen khaali pade jagahon ke liye mantriyon ke naam dene se inkaar kar diya
 Kamal Nath will have a lot of effort in beating the opposition, he will have to convince the allies

 The woman, who works as a non-teaching staff at Delhi University's Atmaram Sanatan Dharma College, says that Sandeep Sharma, who was on special duty as principal in his own college, started molesting him on campus

 saaho kaa box offis par danka baj rahaa he
 When the actor entered the silver screen after 2 years of the Bahubali series, the eagerness of the fans was bound to peak
 first de first sho ke liye deshbhar main advance tikaten book huin
 But the poor response received from the critics piqued the fan's aspirations
 saaho chaahe ullekhneey kamai kar rahi ho, magar concept, kahani, screenple ke maamle main film lachar sabit hui
 Prabhas fans may hesitate to accept this, but this is the truth
 bahubali main apni acting kaa loha manwaane vaale prabhas kii acting skills bhi kathghare main he
 The bitter truth is that Saaho is running only on the basis of Prabhas' fandom
 aise main bahubali actor ko qamar kasne kii jarurat he
 So that after seeing Saaho, the trust of the people is broken and it can be restored
 kaise niraash phens kaa dil jeet sakate hai prabhasabahubali siries ke baad logon ne mana ki actor kii agali film bahubali se badi or uske level kii hogi
 In such a situation, the fans-critics were naturally disappointed when Prabhas chose a weak project like Saaho
 saaho kaa haal dekhne ke baad prabhas ko apane agle project ko soch samajhakar chunanaa chahie
 a project that would make Prabhas again Bahubali among the audience
 vaise prabhas kii agali film lav story par aadhaarit he
 Change in the selection of films These days concepts, reality and social drama based films are going on
 prabhas ne zyaadaatar ection, romantic joner kii filmon main hi kaam kiya he
 Now Prabhas is not just confined to South Industry, he also has a strong demand in Bollywood and is an actor's favorite across the country
 prabhas ko apane comfortable jone se hatakar filmein kerani hogi, taaki ve phens ko unki acting ke alag-alag shades dekhne ko mil sake
 Prabhas's Hindi dubbing is being criticized in coinsaaho in Bollywood for not learning Hindi
 actor ko hindi audiyans ke bich hit hone ke liye hindi bolne main tej-tarraar hona hoga
 Then Prabhas can succeed in Bollywood

 inke alaava film main salmaan khan, rekha, shatrughna sinha, sonakshi sinha or gippi gereval bhi mehmaan kalakaaron kii bhoomika main najar aaenge
 The film will be released in theaters across the country on 31 August
 film kii relies se hamane bobi deol se baatcheet kii he
 Regarding the debut of Yamla Pagla Deewana Phir again, Bobby said, "the way the first and the second part started, Bhaiya and Papa thought about the planning of the film when the third part got the story
 vaisaa hi hua
 We worked on the story and then the shooting started
 kariyar main gap ko lekar bobi ne kaha, "mujhe shuru se yah pataa tha ki mere liye sani deol kaa bhai or dharmendra kaa betaa hona kaaphi nahin he
 i have to prove myself
 lack bhi ek samay tak hi saath detaa he
 Hard work is most important
 ab dharmendra kaa betaa hum to mujhe kaam miltaa rahegaa aisa nahin hota
 My mistake was that my focus shifted away from work
 isaki vajah thi
 Good films are not offered
 "bobi deolane bataaya, "un dinon main ajeeb si filmon main kaam kar rahaa tha or khud se gussa bhi ho rahaa tha
 Had become fond of liquor, then he had started drinking too much
 ham insaan hi hai isliye galtiyaan hui hai
 But now i am learning from mistakes and moving forward
 ab logon kii ankho main jab khud ke liye pyaar, sammaan, khushi or saraahna dekhtaa hum to or bhi takat milti he
 i work more hard to maintain this love and respect in the eyes of the people
 "salmaan kii vajah se rekha or shatrughna ne kiya chemeophils mensalmaan khanjise bade sitaron ke chemiyo par bobi ne kaha, "haa main salmaan khan ke sathres 3kii shooting kar rahaa tha
 During this time i asked Salman if he would like to act as a guest star in our film
 salmaan turant raji ho gaye
 It is also because of his love for my father Dharmendra
 " bobi ne yah bhi bataaya, "salmaan kii vajah se hi hamaari film main rekha, shatrughna sinha or sonakshi sinha gane par parform ko taiyaar hue
 "did Salman get work in Race 3? Bobby said - It was because of Salman that he got work in Race 3
 salmaan madad ke baad kabhi credit nahin lete
 Bobby said, "when i thanked Salman for his work in Race 3, he said instead of accepting that he really wanted me to cast him in the film
" unka behad shukraguzaar hum
 When i first took off my shirt in Race 3, people saw me and they liked it
 "bobi ne bataaya ki unke liye salmaan bade bhai sani deol kii tarah hi hai
 He said, "he still calls me occasionally today
 vah kabhi-kabhi mere gym trainer ko bhi kol kar mere bare main poochhate hai ki bobi deol thik se gym aa rahaa he yaa nahin
 "not looking for a good character," said Bobby, "he is looking for good and strong characters right now
 kisi film main lead role ho yaa nahin, isse koi fark nahin padataa
 If i get a good role, i will do a web series too
 main vahi film yaa siries karnaa chahta hum, jise puraa parivaar ek saath dekh sake
 There was a dark cinema offer and if i got a very interesting character, i would think about that
 " unhone kaha, "abhi main sirf commercial cinema par dhyaan de rahaa hum
 My fans just want to see me in a glamor role
 wo kehete hai ki aap bichchhu, barsaat, gupt, soljar, hamraaj, ajanabi or badal jaisi filmein kariye
 Bobby said, "I couldn't even understand at the time why this was happening
" kisi bhi film ke khilaaf itani nakaaratmakataa dekhne ko nahin milti
 People were trolling all of us on anything, but we all saw the power of Salman at the box office
 itnaa majaak udaane ke baavjood film ne 200 karod kii kamai kii
 No artist can choose 100 percent of hit films
 yah darshakon ke upar hota he ki wo film ko pasand karte hai yaa nahin
 i would say that this is my first 200 million film
 res 3 mere liye hameshaa yaadgaar film rahegi
 "on the happiness of my own career, Bobby said," If i compare my early days with today, then at that time came into the industry with new freshness
 lekin duusari pari ke vakt main dugani taazgi or dam-kham ke saath aayaa hum
 i know what i lost
 vaapasi main us cheez kii ahmiyat zyada he
 The energy that is in me today is more than the energy in a 20 year old boy
 "aage kii planning ko lekar bobi ne kaha, "asafalataaon se main shaktishaalee insaan ban gaya hum
 Being a son of Dharmendra, i was very lucky
 jo papa ke fain the unhone mujhe apanaaya, pyaar diya
 Papa's fans want their sons to progress as well
 pehle bhaiya (sani deol) ko hathohath liya
 Then people saw and appreciated my work
 meri asafalataa se mujhe chaahane vaale bhi khush nahin the
 When man is not working, people start making up stories
 main thak gaya tha in kahaniyon se or maine mehnat kar tamaam logon se milanaa shuru kiya
 Then Salman also worked in Race 3 and Sajid Nadiadwala in Housefull 4
 housephul 4 ko lekar unhone kaha, "main ek baar phir lambey baalo main najar aauungaa
 But not real
 balki nakli baalo ke saath
 Housefull 4 is a story of rebirth
 film ke kuch hisson main ham sabhi rajasi costum or lambey baalo main najar aaenge

 patna kaa mahatma gandhi setubarason se badahaali kaa shikaar rahaa he
 The central government has also kept this in focus
 barason se buree tarah hill rahe or jagah jagah se tut chuke is pul kii marammat ke liye modi sarkaar ne 1742 karod rupee manjuur kar liye hai
 Of this, Rs 1355 crore is allocated for civil construction
 isse pehle japani company jaayaka se takhmina liya gaya tha
 The company caught an estimate of Rs 2800 crore
 lekin desi company ne 1742 karod main hi acchhee gunvattta ke saath ye marammat kaa kaam karne kii hami bhar lee
 Work will also start on 15 August
 pul ke takneekee paksh par rudki iaiti ke visheshgy adhyayan kar upaay bataaenge
 Separate help for maintenance is in addition to the Rs 200 crore that has been given to the Bihar government for its repair and better maintenance
 upabhokta maamalon ke mantri or endie ke ghatak lojpa adhyaksh ram vilaas paswan ne kaha ki centre ke liye lajimi ho ki wo is 200 karod rupee ke kharch par nigaraanee rakhe
 Because the state government officials will eat the commission there
 itnaa hi nahin centre sarkaar ne mahatma gandhi sethu ke samanaantar ek nayaa pul banane kii bhi pariyojna ko cabinet ne manjuuri de di he
 Its DPR i
e
 detail project report will be ready in three months
 iske baad kaam shuru ho jayega
 Road Transport and Highway Minister Nitin Gadkari said that this bridge was weak at the time of construction due to poor and outdated technology
 phir is par se baari vaahanon kii choubison ghante awajahi
 Bridge responded
 1972 main bananaa shuru hua or das saal baad 1982 main banakar taiyaar hua
 This is a matter of bridges ab centre sarkaar kaa kahana he ki haar ke baavjood hamane bihar se jo vaada kiya tha use puraa kar rahe hai
 In the current year, schemes worth Rs 60 thousand crores have been approved for Bihar
 agle chaar saalon main sarkaar bihar ke liye dhai lakh rupee kii yojanaayen puri karne kaa lakshya he
 Hardwork has more power than Harvard
 naaraa to saria, cement ke vigyaapan jaisaa hi zordaar he
 This googling of the Prime Minister may have increased the antithesis of the Harvard people
 vaise hardwork naam kii koi uniwarsity nahin he phir bhi pareshaan to honge ki kya ve bina hardwork ke hi harvard vaale ho gaye
 For the first time, the Harvard people have received the Sirius challenge from Maharajganj in UP
 abhi tak harvard vaale sirf apana visiting card dikhaakar raajnneetik dal se lekar rigerv bank tak main governor ban jaaya karte the
 May be there is panic in taking name of your university in train or bus
 lekin itnaa bhi manobal giraane kii zarurat nahin he kyonki harvard vaale modi sarkaar main bhi hai
 Their setting takes place in every government
 yahi harvard ke hardwork kaa kamaal he
 Those who are doing hardwork in Maharajganj will not understand the cleverness and cleverness of Harvard, at least in this birth
 upie sarkaar ke arthtantr ke tamaam padon par harvard, oxford se aae arthshaatriyon ko bade paimaane par jagah milani shuru hui
 In this case, the Prime Minister has rightly said that he has been running the same economy for thirty forty years
 magar unka dabadabaa modi sarkaar ke arthtantr main bhi usee tarah bana hua he
 They should have a Sirius review
 harvard america main he or oxford britain main
 Manmohan Singh, who came from Oxford, is considered to be the leader of liberalization
 pi chidambaram harvard bijness skool se pard kar aae hai
 There are critics of demonetisation
 nobel puraskaar praapt amartya sen to harvard main professor hi hai, notebandi ke aalochak hai
 Former Economic Advisor Kaushik Basu has taught at Harvard
 notebandi ke aalochak hai
 Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Virmani has been associated with Harvard during the UPA era
 raghuram rajan harvard or oxford ke nahin hai, uniwarsity of chicago main padhaate hai
 Former RBI governor Vimal Jalan hails from Cambridges and Oxford
 isliye rajan to batch gaye
 Lalu Yadav and Arvind Kejriwal also survived
 vaise lalu jab rail mantri the to harvard waalon ne un par project kiya tha
 They have also been critics of demonetisation
 manmohan singh oxford vaale hai jo 2 pratishat jidipi main giravat kii baat kar rahe the
 The Prime Minister is right that economists from Harvard Oxford have been frozen for thirty years
 ek tarah se dekhiye to landan skool of iconomix, uniwarsity of chicago, harvard uniwarsity, oxford, cambries se padhakar aae arthshaastri, uniwarsity of pennsylvania ke arthshaastriyon kaa vishwa bank, antarrashtriya mudra kosh se lekar bharat ke tamaam aarthik padon par kabza rahaa he
 This is their policy
 upie raaj main inkaa dabadabaa tha
 It is not as if everyone is thrown out as soon as Modi government comes
 arabiai governor urjit patel to upie kaal main dipti governor banakar aae the
 The dominance of these universities is also maintained in the Modi government
 aapako lagegaa ki ye log upie kaal main aae isliye koi udaaravaadi honge, libral honge, lekin inaki nitiyon or soch ko dekhenge to sab ke sab ghor ritwing yani dakshinpanthi hai yaa unase bahut alag nahin hai
 Economists of these universities dominate the countries around the world
 bharat main bhi he
 In the post-1990 India, the Congress also operates on the same policies, the BJP also runs
 harvard par atake karne kaa yah matlab nahin he ki swadeshi jaagran vaale khush ho jaaen
 i do not know what effect this statement might have had on the Harvard Oxford people in the Modi government's economy
 kya ve apane biodeta se harvard yaa oxford kaa naam hataa lenge
 These are the names that support Demonetisation
 yani harvard waalon main se kaiyon ne notebandi kaa samarthan bhi kiya tha balki lagu karaane main ji jaan se jute the
 Like RBI Governor Urjit Patel has mphil from Oxford
 purv vitt rajya mantri or maujuuda naagarik uddyan mantri jayant sinha harvard bijness skool se emb hai
 Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian has also studied at Harvard, studied at Oxford
 niti ayog ke sadsy bibek debaray cambridge vishvavidhyalay ke hai
 The NITI Aayog is headed by Princeton University, USA
 ye isliye bataaya taaki kuch log ati utsaah main maharajaganj vaale bayaan ke baad harvard bharat chodo kaa naaraa na buland karne lagen
 Harvard people have not played raw bullets
 unhen pataa he upie se lekar endie sarkaron main khud ko kaise set kiya jaataa he
 Do not take these things to heart at the Rajasthan University and Sagar University economics professors
 harvard vaale mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanian ne notebandi kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Before the budget, presenting an economic survey led by Arvind Subramanian, it was said that the real GDP rate of 2016-17 can fall from a quarter to a half percent
 2016-17 ke dauraan jidipi growth 6
 Will be 5 percent
 lakshya se aadha pratishat kam
 Arvind Subramanian sir may say that i have come from Harvard but have done a lot of hardwork in support of demonetisation
 urjit patel bhi kah sakate hai ki sar oxford se aayaa to kya hua, notebandi ke liye to hameen log hardwork kar rahe the
 The Modi government has decided on the suggestion of the Reserve Bank
 aisa kaha jaataa rahaa he
 Even now three of the three executive directors of the Reserve Bank of India are associated with Harvard
 yani notebandi ko lagu karne main harvard kaa bhi yogadan he
 Not just hardwork
 harvard vaale naagarik uddyan mantri jayant sinha to notebandi ko aitihaasik hi bataa rahe the
 We have done a little research for visitors who have not gone to Harvard like me
 britain kii oxford uniwarsity america kii harvard uniwarsity se chaar sau saal pehle bani thi
 Harvard University was established in 1636
 bharat main iske do sau saal baad yani 1857 main maas uniwarsity kii sthapana hui
 Nalanda, apologizing to those who are passionate about Taxila, i want to say this much that i am talking about Harvard Oxford in connection with the modern university
 harvard ke 48 prophessoron ko alag alag vishyon main nobel puraskaar mil chukaa he
 Now if we have considered the Nobel Prize as false, then it is fine, by the way, 10 professors related to economics of Harvard have received the Nobel Prize
 yah uniwarsity daawa karti he ki yahaan se padhakar nikle chaatro ne duniya bhar main do karod naukariyaan paidaa kii hai
 Harvard's board will be found in the board of three lakh companies worldwide
 yahaan se padhakar nikle chaatro ne 150 deshon main 1 lakh 46,000 munafa kamaane vaali or gair munaafe vaali companiyaan banaai hai
 i am not telling all this to hurting the people of Delhi University
 yahaan ke tamaam skulon se padhakar nikle 3 lakh 75 hazaar chaatr duniya bhar ke 201 deshon main rahete hai
 Bill Gates and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg are also from Harvard
 harvard ne ek adhyayan karaayaa tha ki uske yahaan se padhakar nikle logon kaa duniya kii arthvyavastha par kya asar padaa he
 All this information has been received from Google
 isi adhyayan ke tahat harvard ne yah jaananaa chaha ki uske yahaan ke nikle log saal bhar main kitna rajasav paidaa kar pate honge
 Maharajganj Inter College should also do such study
 to harvard ko pataa padaa ki uske chaatro kii banaai companiyaan ek saal main kareeb 4 arab dollar salanaa rajasav paidaa karti hai, jo germany kii jidipi ke baraabar he
 Germany is the fourth largest economy in the world
 bharat duniya kii chauthi badi arthvyavastha nahin he
 India's GDP is about two and a half billion dollars in size
 yani harvard ke paune chaar lakh chaatr bharat kii jidipi se zyada salanaa rajasav paidaa karte hai
 The comments pradhanmantri shuru se kah rahe hai ki notebandi kaa aisa faisla he ki bade se bada arthshaastri samaj nahin paa rahaa he
 All the big economists of his government are praising the ban on demonetisation
 jidipi ke aankadon ko lekar bahes ho rahi he, unki satyata ko lekar chunautiyaan milani shuru ho gayi hai lekin yah sawaal aap khud se puuchhiye ki do maheene tak jo khabaren chap rahi thim ki udyog dhandhon kaa utpaadan gira he, upbhog kam hua he, chantni hui he, fal sabzi vaale kisaan barbaad hue hai, to kya us dauraan logon ne media se jhooth bolaa
 Did the workers return to their homes from Surat, Delhi and Mumbai, lying that their work has stopped, so the villages have come
 jab logon ke paas cash nahin tha, tab kaise arthvyavastha raftaar pakadi rahi, ye sab sawaal to koi meerut uniwarsity vaala hi bataa saktaa he yaa wo jo uniwarsity gaya hi na ho
 There is creativity, mischief and seriousness in the Prime Minister's statement
 isi kadi main ek sharaarat or ho sakati he
 The Ministry of Human Resources should ensure that no Harvard branch opens in India
 aisi bekaar uniwarsity kaa branch kyon khule
 Universities of India can put up boards on their behalf, none of our branches is related to Harvard
 ek hi dar he
 Encouraged by the Prime Minister's statement, do not declare yourself the Vice Chancellor of the University of India as superior to Harvard
 kyonki bharat kii uniwarsity ke zyaadaatar vaais chancelar arthshaastri na hote hue bhi notebandi kaa purazor samarthan kar rahe the
 When President Donald Trump prohibited the arrival of students and refugees from Muslim countries and other countries, 17 universities, including Harvard, have filed a case in the Federal Court of New York

 p Chidambaram is from Harvard Business School
 notebandi ke aalochak hai
 Amartya Sen, a Nobel Laureate, is a professor at Harvard, a critic of demonetisation
 purv aarthik salaahkaar kowshik basu harvard main padhaa chuke hai
 There are critics of demonetisation
 upie daur main mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind viramani harvard se jude rahe hai
 Raghuram Rajan is not from Harvard and Oxford, teaches at the University of Chicago
 purv arabiai governor vimal jalaan cambries or oxford se rahe hai
 That's why Rajan survived
 lalu yadav or arvind kejariwal bhi batch gaye
 By the way, when Lalu was the railway minister, the Harvard people had project on him
 ye bhi notebandi ke aalochak rahe hai vaise
 Manmohan Singh is an Oxford man who was talking about a 2 percent GDP decline
 pradhanmantri kii yah baat sahi he ki tees tees saal se harvard oxford se aae arthshaastri jame hue hai
 In a way, the World Bank of Economists from London School of Economics, University of Chicago, Harvard University, Oxford, Cambridges, World Bank of Economists from University of Pennsylvania, from International Monetary Fund to India have been occupying all the economic positions
 inhen kii niti chalati he
 He dominated the UPA rule

 RBI Governor Urjit Patel then came as deputy governor during the UPA era
 in vishvavidhyalayon kaa dabadabaa modi sarkaar main bhi kaayam he
 You would think that these people came in the UPA era, so some would be liberals, would be Liberals, but looking at their policies and thinking, all of them are right-wing or right-wing or not very different from them
 duniya bhar ke deshon main in uniwarsity ke arthshaastriyon kaa dabadabaa he
 Is also in India
 1990 ke baad ke bharat main unheen nitiyon par congress bhi chalati he, bijepi bhi chalati he
 Attacking Harvard does not mean that the indigenous Jagran is happy
 modi sarkaar ke arthtantr main jo harvard oxford vaale hai un par is bayaan kaa kya asar hua hoga, mujhe nahin maaloom
 Will they remove Harvard or Oxford from their curriculum vitae
 ye wo naam hai jo notebandi ke samarthak hai
 That is, many of the Harvard people also supported the ban on demonetisation, rather they were busy in implementing it
 jaise arabiai governor urjit patel ne oxford se emphil kiya he
 Jayant Sinha, former Minister of State for Finance and current Minister of Civil Aviation, holds an MBA from Harvard Business School
 mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanian bhi harvard main padhaa chuke hai, oxford se pard chuke hai
 Bibek Debroy, a member of the NITI Aayog, is of Cambridge University
 niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh america ke princeton uniwarsity ke hai
 This was told so that some people, after the statement of Maharajganj in great enthusiasm, started raising the slogan of 'quit Harvard India'
 harvard waalon ne kachi goliyaan nahin kheli hai
 They know how to set themselves up from UPA to NDA governments
 rajasthan uniwarsity or sagar uniwarsity ke arthshaastra ke professor dil par na len meri in baton ko
 Harvard's Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian supported demonetisation
 bajet se pehle arvind subramanian ke netritv main bane aarthik survey pesh karte hue kaha gaya tha ki 2016-17 kii vaastavik jidipi dar main chauthai se lekar aadha pratishat tak kii giravat aa sakati he
 GDP growth 6 during 2016–17
 5 pratishat rahegi
 Half a percent below target
 arvind subramanian sahab kah sakate hai ki main harvard se aayaa hum magar notebandi ke samarthan main kaaphi hardwork kiya hum
 Urjit Patel can also say that what happened when Sir came from Oxford, our people were working hard for demonetisation
 reserve bank ke suzav par hi to modi sarkaar ne faisla liya he
 It has been said
 is vakt bhi bhartiya reserve bank ke teen teen kaaryakari nideshak harvard se jude hai
 That is, Harvard has also contributed to the implementation of demonetisation
 sirf hardwork kaa nahin
 Harvard Civil Aviation Minister Jayant Sinha was describing demonetisation as historical
 jo darshak meri tarah harvard nahin gaye hai unke liye hamane thodaa research kiya he
 Oxford University of Britain was formed four hundred years before Harvard University of America
 harvard uniwarsity kii sthapana 1636 main hui thi
 Two hundred years later, in 1857, Mass University was established in India
 nalanda, takshashila ko lekar bhavuk hone waalon se maafee chaahate hue itnaa hi kahana chahta hum ki main aadhunik uniwarsity ke silsile main harvard oxford kii baat kar rahaa hum
 48 Harvard professors have received Nobel Prizes in different disciplines
 ab agar hamane nobel puraskaar ko bhi thenge baraabar samaj liya he to koi baat nahin, vaise harvard ke arthshaastra se jude 10 prophessoron ko nobel puraskaar mil chukaa he
 This university claims that the students who have come out of here have created two crore jobs worldwide
 duniya bhar main teen lakh companiyon ke board main harvard kaa padhaa hua mil jayega
 The students who have come out of here have formed 1 lakh 46,000 profitable and non-profitable companies in 150 countries
 ye sab main dilli vishvavidhyalay waalon ko aahat karne ke liye nahin bataa rahaa hum
 The 3 lakh 75 thousand students who have come out of all the schools here live in 201 countries around the world
 bill gates or fasebuk ke sansthaapak mark zukarbarg bhi harvard ke hi hai
 Howard had conducted a study of how the people who came out of his studies have affected the world economy
 google se ye yah sab jaankaree mili he
 According to this study, Harvard wanted to know how much revenue its people would have been able to generate in a year
 maharajaganj inter college ko bhi aisa adhyayan karnaa chahie
 So Howard came to know that his student-run companies generate about $ 4 billion a year in revenue, which is equivalent to Germany's GDP
 germany duniya kii chauthi badi arthvyavastha he
 India is not the fourth largest economy in the world
 bharat kii jidipi kaa aakaar kareeb dhai arab dollar he
 That is, a quarter of a million Harvard students generate more revenue than India's GDP annually
 tippaniyan The Prime Minister has been saying from the beginning that there is such a decision of demonetisation that even the greatest economist is unable to understand
 unki sarkaar ke tamaam bade arthshaastri to notebandi kii tarif hi kar rahe hai
 There are debates about GDP figures, challenges have started to be found on the veracity of them, but ask this question yourself, for two months the news that was being published that production of industry businesses has dropped, consumption has reduced, layoffs Has the fruit vegetable farmers been ruined, so did people lie to the media during that time
 kya surat, dilli or mumbai se gaanv gharon ko laut kar mazdoor jhooth bol rahe the ki unke yahaan kaam band ho gaya he isliye gaanv aae hai
 When people did not have cash, how the economy was gaining momentum, only a person from Meerut University can tell these questions or one who has not gone to university
 pradhanmantri ke bayaan main rachanaatmakataa he, sharaarat he or gambhirtha bhi he
 There may be another prank in this episode
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay yah sunishchit kare ki harvard kii koi bhi branch bharat main na khule
 Why open such a useless university branch bharat kii uniwarsity apni taraf se board laga sakati hai hamaara koi bhi branch harvard se sambandhit nahin he
 There is only one fear
 pradhanmantri ke bayaan se utsahit hokar bharat kii uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar khud ko harvard se shreshth na ghoshit kar den
 Because most of the Vice Chancellors of the University of India, despite being economists, were strongly supporting the ban on demonetisation
 jab raashtrapati donald trump ne muslim deshon or anya deshon se aane vaale chaatro, sharnaarthiyon ke aagaman par roak lagaai to iskaa virodh vahaan kii harvard sahit 17 uniwarsity ne milakar neuyork ke fedral court main cese kar diya he
 It has been said that if students do not come from different places, the exchange of ideas will be affected
 kya aap bharat main aise kisi bhi vishvavidhyalay kaa naam jaanate hai jisane aisa saahas kiya ho
 Have filed a case against your government
 diu ne kiya kya, jeenyu ne kiya kya
 That's why Rajan survived
 lalu yadav or arvind kejariwal bhi batch gaye
 By the way, when Lalu was the railway minister, the Harvard people had project on him
 ye bhi notebandi ke aalochak rahe hai vaise
 Manmohan Singh is an Oxford man who was talking about a 2 percent GDP decline
 pradhanmantri kii yah baat sahi he ki tees tees saal se harvard oxford se aae arthshaastri jame hue hai
 In a way, the World Bank of Economists from London School of Economics, University of Chicago, Harvard University, Oxford, Cambridges, World Bank of Economists from University of Pennsylvania, from International Monetary Fund to India have been occupying all the economic positions
 inhen kii niti chalati he
 He dominated the UPA rule
 modi sarkaar ke aate hi sab baahar nikaal die gaye hon aisa bhi nahin he
 RBI Governor Urjit Patel then came as deputy governor during the UPA era
 in vishvavidhyalayon kaa dabadabaa modi sarkaar main bhi kaayam he
 You would think that these people came in the UPA era, so some would be liberals, would be Liberals, but looking at their policies and thinking, all of them are right-wing or right-wing or not very different from them
 duniya bhar ke deshon main in uniwarsity ke arthshaastriyon kaa dabadabaa he
 Is also in India
 1990 ke baad ke bharat main unheen nitiyon par congress bhi chalati he, bijepi bhi chalati he
 Attacking Harvard does not mean that the indigenous Jagran is happy
 modi sarkaar ke arthtantr main jo harvard oxford vaale hai un par is bayaan kaa kya asar hua hoga, mujhe nahin maaloom
 Will they remove Harvard or Oxford from their curriculum vitae
 ye wo naam hai jo notebandi ke samarthak hai
 That is, many of the Harvard people also supported the ban on demonetisation, rather they were busy in implementing it
 jaise arabiai governor urjit patel ne oxford se emphil kiya he
 Jayant Sinha, former Minister of State for Finance and current Minister of Civil Aviation, holds an MBA from Harvard Business School
 mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanian bhi harvard main padhaa chuke hai, oxford se pard chuke hai
 Bibek Debroy, a member of the NITI Aayog, is of Cambridge University
 niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh america ke princeton uniwarsity ke hai
 This was told so that some people, after the statement of Maharajganj in great enthusiasm, started raising the slogan of 'quit Harvard India'
 harvard waalon ne kachi goliyaan nahin kheli hai
 They know how to set themselves up from UPA to NDA governments
 rajasthan uniwarsity or sagar uniwarsity ke arthshaastra ke professor dil par na len meri in baton ko
 Harvard's Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian supported demonetisation
 bajet se pehle arvind subramanian ke netritv main bane aarthik survey pesh karte hue kaha gaya tha ki 2016-17 kii vaastavik jidipi dar main chauthai se lekar aadha pratishat tak kii giravat aa sakati he
 GDP growth 6 during 2016–17
 5 pratishat rahegi
 Half a percent below target
 arvind subramanian sahab kah sakate hai ki main harvard se aayaa hum magar notebandi ke samarthan main kaaphi hardwork kiya hum
 Urjit Patel can also say that what happened when Sir came from Oxford, our people were working hard for demonetisation
 reserve bank ke suzav par hi to modi sarkaar ne faisla liya he
 It has been said
 is vakt bhi bhartiya reserve bank ke teen teen kaaryakari nideshak harvard se jude hai
 That is, Harvard has also contributed to the implementation of demonetisation
 sirf hardwork kaa nahin
 Harvard Civil Aviation Minister Jayant Sinha was describing demonetisation as historical
 jo darshak meri tarah harvard nahin gaye hai unke liye hamane thodaa research kiya he
 Oxford University of Britain was formed four hundred years before Harvard University of America
 harvard uniwarsity kii sthapana 1636 main hui thi
 Two hundred years later, in 1857, Mass University was established in India
 nalanda, takshashila ko lekar bhavuk hone waalon se maafee chaahate hue itnaa hi kahana chahta hum ki main aadhunik uniwarsity ke silsile main harvard oxford kii baat kar rahaa hum
 48 Harvard professors have received Nobel Prizes in different disciplines
 ab agar hamane nobel puraskaar ko bhi thenge baraabar samaj liya he to koi baat nahin, vaise harvard ke arthshaastra se jude 10 prophessoron ko nobel puraskaar mil chukaa he
 This university claims that the students who have come out of here have created two crore jobs worldwide
 duniya bhar main teen lakh companiyon ke board main harvard kaa padhaa hua mil jayega
 The students who have come out of here have formed 1 lakh 46,000 profitable and non-profitable companies in 150 countries
 ye sab main dilli vishvavidhyalay waalon ko aahat karne ke liye nahin bataa rahaa hum
 The 3 lakh 75 thousand students who have come out of all the schools here live in 201 countries around the world
 bill gates or fasebuk ke sansthaapak mark zukarbarg bhi harvard ke hi hai
 Howard had conducted a study of how the people who came out of his studies have affected the world economy
 google se ye yah sab jaankaree mili he
 According to this study, Harvard wanted to know how much revenue its people would have been able to generate in a year
 maharajaganj inter college ko bhi aisa adhyayan karnaa chahie
 So Howard came to know that his student-run companies generate about $ 4 billion a year in revenue, which is equivalent to Germany's GDP
 germany duniya kii chauthi badi arthvyavastha he
 India is not the fourth largest economy in the world
 bharat kii jidipi kaa aakaar kareeb dhai arab dollar he
 That is, a quarter of a million Harvard students generate more revenue than India's GDP annually
 tippaniyan The Prime Minister has been saying from the beginning that there is such a decision of demonetisation that even the greatest economist is unable to understand
 unki sarkaar ke tamaam bade arthshaastri to notebandi kii tarif hi kar rahe hai
 There are debates about GDP figures, challenges have started to be found on the veracity of them, but ask this question yourself, for two months the news that was being published that production of industry businesses has dropped, consumption has reduced, layoffs Has the fruit vegetable farmers been ruined, so did people lie to the media during that time
 kya surat, dilli or mumbai se gaanv gharon ko laut kar mazdoor jhooth bol rahe the ki unke yahaan kaam band ho gaya he isliye gaanv aae hai
 When people did not have cash, how the economy was gaining momentum, only a person from Meerut University can tell these questions or one who has not gone to university
 pradhanmantri ke bayaan main rachanaatmakataa he, sharaarat he or gambhirtha bhi he
 There may be another prank in this episode
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay yah sunishchit kare ki harvard kii koi bhi branch bharat main na khule
 Why open such a useless university branch bharat kii uniwarsity apni taraf se board laga sakati hai hamaara koi bhi branch harvard se sambandhit nahin he
 There is only one fear
 pradhanmantri ke bayaan se utsahit hokar bharat kii uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar khud ko harvard se shreshth na ghoshit kar den
 Because most of the Vice Chancellors of the University of India, despite being economists, were strongly supporting the ban on demonetisation
 jab raashtrapati donald trump ne muslim deshon or anya deshon se aane vaale chaatro, sharnaarthiyon ke aagaman par roak lagaai to iskaa virodh vahaan kii harvard sahit 17 uniwarsity ne milakar neuyork ke fedral court main cese kar diya he
 It has been said that if students do not come from different places, the exchange of ideas will be affected
 kya aap bharat main aise kisi bhi vishvavidhyalay kaa naam jaanate hai jisane aisa saahas kiya ho
 Have filed a case against your government
 diu ne kiya kya, jeenyu ne kiya kya
 i do not know what effect this statement might have had on the Harvard Oxford people in the Modi government's economy
 kya ve apane biodeta se harvard yaa oxford kaa naam hataa lenge
 These are the names that support Demonetisation
 yani harvard waalon main se kaiyon ne notebandi kaa samarthan bhi kiya tha balki lagu karaane main ji jaan se jute the
 Like RBI Governor Urjit Patel has mphil from Oxford
 purv vitt rajya mantri or maujuuda naagarik uddyan mantri jayant sinha harvard bijness skool se emb hai
 Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian has also studied at Harvard, studied at Oxford
 niti ayog ke sadsy bibek debaray cambridge vishvavidhyalay ke hai
 The NITI Aayog is headed by Princeton University, USA
 ye isliye bataaya taaki kuch log ati utsaah main maharajaganj vaale bayaan ke baad harvard bharat chodo kaa naaraa na buland karne lagen
 Harvard people have not played raw bullets
 unhen pataa he upie se lekar endie sarkaron main khud ko kaise set kiya jaataa he
 Do not take these things to heart at the Rajasthan University and Sagar University economics professors
 harvard vaale mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanian ne notebandi kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Before the budget, presenting an economic survey led by Arvind Subramanian, it was said that the real GDP rate of 2016-17 can fall from a quarter to a half percent
 2016-17 ke dauraan jidipi growth 6
 Will be 5 percent
 lakshya se aadha pratishat kam
 Arvind Subramanian sir may say that i have come from Harvard but have done a lot of hardwork in support of demonetisation
 urjit patel bhi kah sakate hai ki sar oxford se aayaa to kya hua, notebandi ke liye to hameen log hardwork kar rahe the
 The Modi government has decided on the suggestion of the Reserve Bank
 aisa kaha jaataa rahaa he
 Even now three of the three executive directors of the Reserve Bank of India are associated with Harvard
 yani notebandi ko lagu karne main harvard kaa bhi yogadan he
 Not just hardwork
 harvard vaale naagarik uddyan mantri jayant sinha to notebandi ko aitihaasik hi bataa rahe the
 We have done a little research for visitors who have not gone to Harvard like me
 britain kii oxford uniwarsity america kii harvard uniwarsity se chaar sau saal pehle bani thi
 Harvard University was established in 1636
 bharat main iske do sau saal baad yani 1857 main maas uniwarsity kii sthapana hui
 Nalanda, apologizing to those who are passionate about Taxila, i want to say this much that i am talking about Harvard Oxford in connection with the modern university
 harvard ke 48 prophessoron ko alag alag vishyon main nobel puraskaar mil chukaa he
 Now if we have considered the Nobel Prize as false, then it is fine, by the way, 10 professors related to economics of Harvard have received the Nobel Prize
 yah uniwarsity daawa karti he ki yahaan se padhakar nikle chaatro ne duniya bhar main do karod naukariyaan paidaa kii hai
 Harvard's board will be found in the board of three lakh companies worldwide
 yahaan se padhakar nikle chaatro ne 150 deshon main 1 lakh 46,000 munafa kamaane vaali or gair munaafe vaali companiyaan banaai hai
 i am not telling all this to hurting the people of Delhi University
 yahaan ke tamaam skulon se padhakar nikle 3 lakh 75 hazaar chaatr duniya bhar ke 201 deshon main rahete hai
 Bill Gates and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg are also from Harvard
 harvard ne ek adhyayan karaayaa tha ki uske yahaan se padhakar nikle logon kaa duniya kii arthvyavastha par kya asar padaa he
 All this information has been received from Google
 isi adhyayan ke tahat harvard ne yah jaananaa chaha ki uske yahaan ke nikle log saal bhar main kitna rajasav paidaa kar pate honge
 Maharajganj Inter College should also do such study
 to harvard ko pataa padaa ki uske chaatro kii banaai companiyaan ek saal main kareeb 4 arab dollar salanaa rajasav paidaa karti hai, jo germany kii jidipi ke baraabar he
 Germany is the fourth largest economy in the world
 bharat duniya kii chauthi badi arthvyavastha nahin he
 India's GDP is about two and a half billion dollars in size
 yani harvard ke paune chaar lakh chaatr bharat kii jidipi se zyada salanaa rajasav paidaa karte hai
 The comments pradhanmantri shuru se kah rahe hai ki notebandi kaa aisa faisla he ki bade se bada arthshaastri samaj nahin paa rahaa he
 All the big economists of his government are praising the ban on demonetisation
 jidipi ke aankadon ko lekar bahes ho rahi he, unki satyata ko lekar chunautiyaan milani shuru ho gayi hai lekin yah sawaal aap khud se puuchhiye ki do maheene tak jo khabaren chap rahi thim ki udyog dhandhon kaa utpaadan gira he, upbhog kam hua he, chantni hui he, fal sabzi vaale kisaan barbaad hue hai, to kya us dauraan logon ne media se jhooth bolaa
 Did the workers return to their homes from Surat, Delhi and Mumbai, lying that their work has stopped, so the villages have come
 jab logon ke paas cash nahin tha, tab kaise arthvyavastha raftaar pakadi rahi, ye sab sawaal to koi meerut uniwarsity vaala hi bataa saktaa he yaa wo jo uniwarsity gaya hi na ho
 There is creativity, mischief and seriousness in the Prime Minister's statement
 isi kadi main ek sharaarat or ho sakati he
 The Ministry of Human Resources should ensure that no Harvard branch opens in India
 aisi bekaar uniwarsity kaa branch kyon khule
 Universities of India can put up boards on their behalf, none of our branches is related to Harvard
 ek hi dar he
 Encouraged by the Prime Minister's statement, do not declare yourself the Vice Chancellor of the University of India as superior to Harvard
 kyonki bharat kii uniwarsity ke zyaadaatar vaais chancelar arthshaastri na hote hue bhi notebandi kaa purazor samarthan kar rahe the
 When President Donald Trump prohibited the arrival of students and refugees from Muslim countries and other countries, 17 universities, including Harvard, have filed a case in the Federal Court of New York
 kaha he ki isse alag alag jagahon se chaatr nahin aaenge to vichaaron ke aadan-pradaan par asar padegaa
 Do you know the name of any university in India that has done such courage? apni sarkaar ke kilaaf cese kiya ho
 What did DU do, what did JNU do? ye isliye bataaya taaki kuch log ati utsaah main maharajaganj vaale bayaan ke baad harvard bharat chodo kaa naaraa na buland karne lagen

 The Prime Minister has been saying from the beginning that there is such a decision of demonetisation that even the greatest economist is unable to understand
 unki sarkaar ke tamaam bade arthshaastri to notebandi kii tarif hi kar rahe hai
 There are debates about GDP figures, challenges have started to be found on the veracity of them, but ask this question yourself, for two months the news that was being published that production of industry businesses has dropped, consumption has reduced, layoffs Has the fruit vegetable farmers been ruined, so did people lie to the media during that time
 kya surat, dilli or mumbai se gaanv gharon ko laut kar mazdoor jhooth bol rahe the ki unke yahaan kaam band ho gaya he isliye gaanv aae hai
 When people did not have cash, how the economy was gaining momentum, only a person from Meerut University can tell these questions or one who has not gone to university
 pradhanmantri ke bayaan main rachanaatmakataa he, sharaarat he or gambhirtha bhi he
 There may be another prank in this episode
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay yah sunishchit kare ki harvard kii koi bhi branch bharat main na khule
 Why open such a useless university branch bharat kii uniwarsity apni taraf se board laga sakati hai hamaara koi bhi branch harvard se sambandhit nahin he
 There is only one fear
 pradhanmantri ke bayaan se utsahit hokar bharat kii uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar khud ko harvard se shreshth na ghoshit kar den
 Because most of the Vice Chancellors of the University of India, despite being economists, were strongly supporting the ban on demonetisation
 jab raashtrapati donald trump ne muslim deshon or anya deshon se aane vaale chaatro, sharnaarthiyon ke aagaman par roak lagaai to iskaa virodh vahaan kii harvard sahit 17 uniwarsity ne milakar neuyork ke fedral court main cese kar diya he
 It has been said that if students do not come from different places, the exchange of ideas will be affected
 kya aap bharat main aise kisi bhi vishvavidhyalay kaa naam jaanate hai jisane aisa saahas kiya ho
 Have filed a case against your government
 diu ne kiya kya, jeenyu ne kiya kya
 There is creativity, mischief and seriousness in the Prime Minister's statement
 isi kadi main ek sharaarat or ho sakati he
 The Ministry of Human Resources should ensure that no Harvard branch opens in India
 aisi bekaar uniwarsity kaa branch kyon khule
 Universities of India can put up boards on their behalf, none of our branches is related to Harvard
 ek hi dar he
 Encouraged by the Prime Minister's statement, do not declare yourself the Vice Chancellor of the University of India as superior to Harvard
 kyonki bharat kii uniwarsity ke zyaadaatar vaais chancelar arthshaastri na hote hue bhi notebandi kaa purazor samarthan kar rahe the
 When President Donald Trump prohibited the arrival of students and refugees from Muslim countries and other countries, 17 universities, including Harvard, have filed a case in the Federal Court of New York
 kaha he ki isse alag alag jagahon se chaatr nahin aaenge to vichaaron ke aadan-pradaan par asar padegaa
 Do you know the name of any university in India that has done such courage? apni sarkaar ke kilaaf cese kiya ho

 said ne daleel di he ki bhartiya film main pakistan or jeyudi ke khilaaf jehar bharaa hua he or film kaa sandesh desh ko badnaam karne vaala he
 He has alleged that the film, pointing to JUD, depicts the 2008 Mumbai attacks and global terrorism, and the subject is being viciously campaigned against Pakistan
 nafrat se bharaa hafiz said kaa bhaashan kabir khan kii film 'phantum' main sunai degaa
 The original clip of Hafiz's speech has been kept in this trailer
 lashkas-e-taiyaba ke sansthaapak ne daawa kiya ki pakistan main adaalatein jeyudi yaa iske kisi anya netaaon kii mumbai hamale main sanliptata ke bharat sarkaar ke aarope ko pehle hi khaarij kar chuki hai
 The phantom revolves around global terrorism
 ise syria, euke, lebanon, canada or bharat main shoot kiya gaya he
 It states that after the 26 / 11 attack, a retired army officer sets out on a covert mission with some brave agents

 The group of four transgenders educated, citing 'lack' in government assistance to their community members to lead a dignified life, has submitted a plea seeking mercy death to the Tamil Nadu government with its plea
 banu, livingsmil, vidya or angel glady ne shuukravaar ko jila colectoret main pesh apni yachika main kaha ki apnelingke kaaran bhedbhaav or anya samasyaon ko lekar nishaanaa banane ke bajaay ve sammaan se maranaa chaahate hai
 The group said that they are trying in vain to get government support, including education and reservation in jobs, to lead a life of dignity
 thanjavur tamil uniwarsity se post graduate banu ne bataaya, 'ham ek sammanit jivan jeena chaahate hai
 That is why we want reservation in education, jobs, but the central and state governments heeded our demand
 'vidya ne kaha ki unke samudaay ke sadasyon ko jivan jeene ke liye majabuuran bheekh maangana padataa he, unhone bheekh mangakar or anya kai tarah se pradarshan kiya
 He said that instead of living such a life, we would prefer to die with dignity

 -input bhashaa a heartbreaking incident of looting has come to light in Sonepat district of Haryana
 jahaan badmaashon ne lut kaa virodh karne vaali ek yuvati kii ankhen hi phod deen
 The woman became blind for a lifetime due to this incident
 dilli ke uttam nagar ilaake kii rahane vaali yuvati kisi kaam sesonipatagai thi
 Where some unknown miscreants saw an opportunity in a deserted area and attacked him with the intention of loot

 The resignation of former Gujarat Minister of State for Home Amit Shah, caught in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, has been termed by the Congress party as "a very small decision given too late"
 congress ne bhaajapa netritv par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki bhaajapa netaaon ne bina kisi pachhataave ke shah ke har kadam par apni sahmati jaahir kii or use nyaaysangat tehraane kii koshish kii
 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi told reporters that this is a small decision taken too late
 kai dinon or hafton tak is mudde ko kheenchna na to shishtataa thi na hi isaki jarurat thi
 Neither remorse nor acceptance of this issue was expressed by the BJP
 bhaajapa netritv or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi abhi tak is maamle par mantri se apni sahmati jataa rahe hai or ise nyaaysangat tehraane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 i am not surprised about this because this is the real culture, gait, character and face of the BJP
 shah maamle main bhaajapa dwaara sibiai ke galat tareeke se istemaal ko lekar lagaae gaye aarope ke bare main singhvi ne kaha ki sibiai ne shah ke khilaaf yah cese janvari main hi daakhil kar diya tha
 If the BJP had any dissatisfaction about this, it should have gone to the Supreme Court at the same time regarding the cbi's alleged misuse, instead it is now showing verbal acrobatics
 vahiin singhvi ne apratyaksh tareeke se varisht bhaajapa netaa laalkrishna adwani par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki ek or grahamantri the jo baad main uppradhanmantri bane or jinhone istipha dene ke maamle main aisa hi virodh darshaya tha

 yogi sarkaar upi ke vikaas ke liye nae faisle to le hi rahi he saath hi puraani yojanaon or nitiyon kii samiksha bhi kii ja rahi he
 In this connection, Yogi Adityanath has taken some decisions which directly hurt the policies and intentions of former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 akhilesh sarkaar ke kuch faislon or yojanaon par bhi yogi sarkaar ne brake laga diya he
 1
 akhilesh kii tasviir vaale rashan card raddayogi sarkaar ne teen karod 40 lakh rashan card radd karne kaa faisla liya

 2
 samaajawaadee awaas skim bandayogi adityanath ne akhilesh yadav sarkaar kii pramukh samaajawaadee awaas skim ko bhi band kar diya he

 darasal centre main modi sarkaar banane ke baad deshbhar main afordable house (sasta ghar) dilaane ke liye pradhanmantri awaas yojana ko launch kiya gaya tha
 The Samajwadi Awas Yojana was launched by the then Akhilesh Yadav government in the state instead of giving preference to this scheme in Uttar Pradesh
 3
 The Samajwadi Pension Scheme has been put on hold by the break-up government with immediate effect on former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's biggest scheme 'samajwadi Pension Scheme' and has issued an order to check its eligibility
 somvaar der raat mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne yah faisla liya

 5
 viipi shaharon kii list badaliyogi sarkaar ne upi ke viipi shaharon kii list bhi badal di he
 According to the latest decision, Gorakhpur, Mathura, Ayodhya and Varanasi will be VIP cities instead of Etawah, Kannauj and Azamgarh
 bataa den ki itawa purv siem akhilesh yadav kaa grih jila he
 While Kannauj is the parliamentary constituency of Dimple Yadav, wife of Akhilesh Yadav
 jabaki azamgarh mulaayam singh yadav kaa kshetra he
 6
 yojanaon se samaajawaadee shabd hatayyogi sarkaar ne akhilesh yadav ke dream projects ko band karne ke alaava samaajawaadee party ke naam se chal rahi yojanaon ke naam bhi badale hai
 The Yogi government also decided to remove the schemes and facilities of the UP government on which the word Socialist was written
 in yojanaon main ab samaajawaadee kii jagah mukhyamantri shabd joda jayega
 7
 gorakhpur pahonchegi metroyogi adityanath ne na sirf akhilesh sarkaar kii yojanaon ko band kiya he
 Rather, he has also decided to take it forward in some form
 upi main metro project ke tahat lakhanu or kanpur jaise bade shaharon ko hi chunaa gaya tha lekin yogi adityanath ne aage badhate hue metro rail project main gorakhpur ko shaamil karne kaa faisla liya he
 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national general secretary Ram Madhav has made a big statement
 ram madhav kaa kahana he ki pakistan adhikrut kashmir (pioke) or aksai china bhi akhand bharat kaa hissaa he
 Ram Madhav said that from the constitutional point of view the accession of Kashmir has already been completed
 puraa kashmir bharat kaa hissaa he
 He said that the resolution to withdraw the share under other countries has been passed
 ram madhav ne bataaya ki saal 1994 main hi sansad sarvasammati se sankalp ko paarit kar chuki he
 He said that it is not a matter of any party but of the whole country
 ram madhav ke mutabik, pehle bhi anuchhed 370 main 40 se zyada sanshodhan hue lekin tab koi nahin bolaa
 The BJP first amended Article 370
 puri prakriya vidhi sammat or sanvaidhanik tareeke se hui
 On the question of detention of the leaders of Kashmir, Ram Madhav said that political detention is a normal thing
 hamaari party ke netaaon ko bhi kai rajyon main iskaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Many times such decisions are taken depending on the circumstances
 unhone kaha ki jald hi halaat saamaanya hone par paabandiyaan hataa di jaaengi
 On Pakistan's decision to stop bilateral trade, Ram Madhav said that Pakistan's stand on this issue is not clear
 bhartiya sansad ne jammu kashmir main anuchhed 370 hataane kaa faisla kiya he jo uskaa aantarik maamla he
 There is no point in reacting it to any other country
 abhi haal main centre sarkaar ne jammu kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataane kaa faisla kiya
 Pakistan has received a strong response to this decision and has decided to expel the Indian Ambassador and stop trade between the two countries

 sisodiya in dinon arvind kejariwal or sanjay singh ke saath gujarat daure par hai or modi ke vikaas ke daavon kii hakeekat jaanane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Kejriwal was briefly detained by the Gujarat Police a day earlier
 sisodiya ne twitor par likhaa, 'gujarat main police meri jasusi kar rahi he
 The people i have been meeting since yesterday evening in Gujarat, the police are harassing, questioning and threatening them
 'day2 in Gujrat-state police is syping on me
 Troubling, questionung, threatening peoole I'm meeting since last evening # akingujarat— Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) March 6, 2014 Significantly, Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday alleged that Modi is trying to disrupt his Gujarat tour
 dilli ke purv mukhyamantri kejariwal ko kal unke daure ke dauraan gujarat ke radhanpur police thane le jaaya gaya tha or phir aadhe ghante baad unhen jane diya gaya tha
 Gujarat AAP convenor Sukhdev Patel claimed that Kejriwal was detained, while the police denied that he had only informed Kejriwal about the model code of conduct which came into effect after the announcement of the election program She came
 haalanki, kejariwal ne aarope lagaaya tha ki police ne upar se aadesh milane ke baad karrwai kii
 Kejriwal had said, 'we came to know in the morning that all the District Superintendents of Police have been instructed to stop Kejriwal under any circumstances

 We knew that they would do such an act
 ' The 150th birth anniversary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi are being celebrated all over the world
 mahatma gandhi kii hatya dilli main prarthana-sabha main jate hue hui thi
 But it has been less noted that Gandhiji invented a unique moral-spiritual and political institution in his time as a prayer-meeting, and during the freedom struggle
 thode aashcharya kii baat yah he ki aaj bhi yani gandhi ji ke ihalok chhodane ke itane barason baad bhi sewagram main har din subah-shaam prarthana-sabha hoti he
 It contains lessons from all religions including Hindu, Islam, Christianity, Buddhist, Jain, Jewish, Zoroastrian etc
 duniya main, jahaan dharmon ko lekar itani hinsa-duraav-aatank kaa maahaul he vahaan samoochee duniya main or kahin niyamit rup se aisa dharm-sambhaav har din hota ho, lagata ho, isaki jaankaree nahin he
 Gandhiji used to speak in the prayer meeting
 unke adhikansh vichaar isi anaupchaarik rup main vyakt hote the
 His canopy was very wide
 raajakmal prakaashan ne ise do khandon main prakashit kiya he
 After Mahatma Buddha, the literature on the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the second man of India on this earth, till date it would be appropriate to read what discourse Bapu gave in a prayer meeting on October 2, 1947, on his birthday, soon after the independence of the country
 bhaaiyo or bahano,aaj ek sikh bhai mere paas aae the
 He said that someone asked me if you heard the voice of Guru Arjun Dev, but the tenth Guru Govind Singh ji changed it, what would you say about it? History is taught that Guru Gobind Singh was born as an enemy of Muslims
 lekin aisa maanane kaa koi sabab nahin, kyonki dasven guru sahab ne kareeb-kareeb yah kaha he jo guru arjuna dev ne kaha tha
 What about Guru Nanak? vah to kehete hai ki mere najadik hindu, musalmaan, sikh main koi antar nahin he
 Some worship, others offer prayers, all are one
 ek brahman puja karata he to duusare dharm vaale bhagwaan ko kosta he, aisa nahin, musalmaan namaaj padhate hai
 Pooja and Namaz are both the same thing
 manus sab ek hai, vaani duusari-duusari he
 Guru Govind Singh has said that Manus is all one and one has many influences, then i assume that we are all one, many
 or dekhne main to anek bhesh hai, lekin vaise sab ek hai
 People are crores, but one by nature
 guru govind singh ne kaha hai, "ekai kaan, ekai deh, ekai bain
 "say back, say god, say adve, say yaksha, say gandharva, say turk
" They are all different, the same Guru Govind Singh ji says- "see, there are many disguises, its effect is one
 " binke maane baani he, baani to ek he, jabaan ek he
 And Atish is the one
 kya musalamaanon ke yahaan ek suraj he or ham or aap logon ke liye koi doosraa suraj he?vah to sabake liye ek hi he
 He says now, water is also one
 ganga bahati he to ganga nahin kahati he ki khabardaar, koi turk ho to meraa jal nahin pi saktaa he, badalon main se jal aata he tab badal nahin kehete hai ki main aata hum par musalamaanon ke liye nahin, parsiyon ke liye nahin, main to sirf hinduon ke liye hum
 Union government should be for Hindus only; This cannot be done
 quran kaho, sita kaho, puraana kaho, sab ek hi hai, lekin libaas alag-alag pahana diya he
 If you write in Arabic language, then say that it is the Quran, write it in Nagari script, write in Sanskrit, but understand it and read it
 to vah kehete hai ki sab ek hai, or aisa kahkar khatm karte hai
 Guru Govind Singh has taught this
 maine poocha ki panditji, agar guru govind singh ne, aap kehete hai vaise kiya bhi ho, to vah galat baat thi
 When there was a fight, hindu-muslims used to die, were injured and injured in the fight, but a sensible disciple of Guru Sahib used to give water to those who were alive
 usne musalamaanon ko bhi pani pilaayaa, hinduon ko bhi or sikhon ko bhi
 He said, i have been taught by Guru Maharaj that there is neither a Muslim nor a Sikh near you, there is no Hindu, everyone is a human being and you have to give water if you have water
 vah aisa thode hi kehete the ki agar koi hindu jakhmi ho gaya he to maraham-pattee laga den lekin agar koi musalmaan jakhmi padaa he to usko vaise hi chhod do
 He asked, but Guruji had fought with Muslims? If he fought, but fought with those Muslims who had left the path of humanity and justice, they had left their religion
 vah dani purush the, nirlypt the, avtari purush the, unke liye mere-tere kaa sawaal nahin tha
 But yes, he used to protect himself, fight, no doubt
 sikh daawa kare ki nahin, ham to ahimsak hai to vah to galat baat hogi
 He holds the saber, but the Guru has taught that the saber is for protection, the saber is for protecting the innocent
he is the saber to jo dusron ko tang karata he us jaalim ke saath ladane ke liye vah kripaan he
 The saber is not for cutting old women, not for cutting children, not for cutting women, not for cutting those who are innocent innocent men
 kripaan kaa to vah kaam nahin he
 The culprit who has been accused and on whom the charge has been proved that it is the culprit, be it a Muslim, no matter who is a Sikh, that saber will go in his stomach
 aap log kripaan jis tareeke se aaj kholte hai vah to jahaalat kii baat he
 If the Saber is snatched from such people, then no sin will be considered, because they have left the religion, learning that the Saber has been misused
 aaj to meri janmatithi he
 i do not celebrate my date of birth in this way
 main to kahata hum ki phaka karo, charkha chalaao, ishwar kaa bhajan karo, yahi janmatithi manaane kaa mere khyal main sachcha tarika he
 For me, today is the day of mourning
 main aaj tak jinda padaa hum
 i am surprised at this, i feel ashamed, i am the person who had a thing out of his tongue that if he did this, crores believed him
 par aaj to meri koi sunata hi nahin he
 i would say that you do it "no, i will not do it" - says so

 tarantaaran cese main punjab police ne giraftaar kiya chatha aatankvadikashmir main hathiyaar nahin pahunche to dilli-punjab main hamale kaa aadeshtarantaaran cese main giraftaar kaa silsilaa jari he
 The Punjab Police has arrested the sixth terrorist
 punjab kii state aaparishan cell ne germany main baithe hue gurmeet singh urf bagga urf doctor ke bhai ko jalandhar se giraftaar kiya
 According to the police, the terrorists had orders for a major attack in Delhi or Punjab, in lieu of not carrying weapons in Kashmir
 punjab ke tarantaaran ke chola sahib gaanv se pakade gaye teror modul ke maamle main giraftaar kaa silsilaa jari he
 Another suspected terrorist has been arrested
 ab tak is maamle main 6 aatanki giraftaar kiye ja chuke hai
 It has been revealed in the inquiry that in the face of not being able to get weapons in Kashmir, the terrorists were in the process of executing a big terrorist conspiracy in Delhi or Punjab
 3 lakh kii nakli karansi bhi baramadapunjab ke state oparation cell ne germany main baithe gurmeet singh urf bagga urf doctor ke bhai ko jalandhar se giraftaar kar liya he

 The first conspiracy of Khalistani terrorists on the isi's order to carry weapons sent through drones from Pakistan was to deliver these weapons to the Kashmiri jihadis who were hiding in Kashmir so that a big terrorist attack in Kashmir would resonate in the whole world
 Listen
 haalanki kashmir main kadi suraksha ke kaaran hathiyaar naa pahunchane kii surat main aatanki punjab yaa dilli main hi bada hamalaa karne kii sajeesh main the, lekin unke pakade jane ke baad ab is par pakistan kii karatuut ke bare main poochtacha kii ja rahi he
 At the Ramlila Maidan rally in Delhi on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the first time openly attacked former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 haalanki modi isse pehle do baar bina naam liye kejariwal yaa aam aadmi party par nishaanaa saadh chuke hai, lekin pradhanmantri banane ke baad yah pehla mauka rahaa jab pradhanmantri narendra modi hamalavar hue
 In the political atmosphere of Delhi till now, the BJP did not seem to give any special feeling to the Aam Aadmi Party and when the media used to talk to the spokespersons or leaders of the BJP when the AAP leader made some allegations or questions, then the party spokesperson was here He used to say that the Aam Aadmi Party does not take any seriously in Delhi
 ' So when state level leaders were not taking Sirius then why did national leaders take Sirius? Even BJP national president Amit Shah attacked the Aam Aadmi Party with a name in the rally and said that no one can beat the people of this party for lying
 sochie ki apane dam par desh jeet chuki or uske baad har rajya main shandaar or aitihaasik pradarshan kar rahi party ke netaa ko aakhir kya zarurat padi us party ke bare main bolne kii jo astitv kii ladaai lard rahi he
 Actually, there are many reasons for this
 pehle jahaan dilli main bijepi kii virdohi aap or congress chunaav main apane kharaab pradarshan se post dikh rahi thi, vahiin ab aam aadmi party chunaav main majbooti se khadi dikhaai detii he
 There is a big claim for lower-class and minority votes with this party, as well as good preparation this time in the Delhi countryside
 pichhali baar bijepi kii aadhi siten dehaat se hi ai thi
 BJP is still maintaining a strong hold in the middle class, traders, youth, but these days the Aam Aadmi Party is busy making a dent in the traders vote bank
 dilli main ek mote anumaan ke mutabiq, kareeb 20 lakh vyapaaree hai
 The trader vote bank has always been with the BJP, but in the last election, the Aam Aadmi Party had given a big shock to the BJP by making a dent in some traders dominated seats
 yaad rahe ki dilli main bijepi pichhali baar keval chaar seat kam rahane par sabase badi party hone par bhi sarkaar nahin bana pai thi For the past few days, Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay has been alleging that AAP has put hoardings across Delhi, claiming that during the 49-day government, there was not a single raid of VAT department on traders, while Satish Upadhyay is quoting an RTI saying that 151 raids were conducted on Delhi traders during the Kejriwal government
 raily ke dauraan bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi un aaropon ko doharaaya
 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party is saying that they were not raids, but regular sample checking, which are done at petrol pumps or liquor shops
 yahi nahin jab se bijepi ne yah aarope lagaaya dilli main aise daawey vaale hording kii sankhya bad gai
 That is, both the parties are pulling the traders votebank
 iske alaava aam aadmi party dilli main sabhi sadakon, galiyon main hording or poster lagaakar or radio par vigyaapan dekar tej prachaar main lagi hui he
 Not only this, under the Aam Aadmi Party strategy, it was a long time to avoid any direct attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, because she has already done her damage before confronting Modi directly, so in this election campaign she will Paying more attention to what he did while in power and then what he will do when he comes into government
 haa centre sarkaar par apni jansabhaon main hamalaa zarur karti he, lekin naa zyada tikhaa or naa hi pradhanmantri kaa naam
 But she definitely wants BJP or Prime Minister to attack her, one of them can give her sympathy in public that when these people (you) are keeping their campaign positive, then BJP / Modi is campaigning negatively? kejariwal ne shuukravaar ko dilli ke purna rajya kaa mudda uthaaya or saath hi party ne ramlila maidan (raily sthal) ke baahar hi apane hording lagavakar likhaa 'pradhanmantri ji se vinamr nivedan' or bahut saare sawaal puch daale
 AAP and Kejriwal gained importance from what Prime Minister Narendra Modi said without naming Kejriwal or AAP and it was confirmed that this party has upset BJP and BJP is also believing that its enemy number one common man in Delhi It is the party itself and the point is that if AAP had not troubled the BJP or had become a threat to the BJP, then why would the Prime Minister attack it? isliye yah tay ho gaya ki dilli chunaav kaa matlab aupchaarik rup se bijepi banaam aap yaa phir do shabdon main 'modi banaam kejariwal' hi kaha jayega

 Ahead of the upcoming four-test series against India, Australia spinners Nathan Lyon and Xavier Doherty are witnessing a stunning performance by the England spinners who helped the team register a historic win in India in December last year
 tippaniyan Indians are considered to be experts in playing spin, but England's Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar troubled the Indian players in the Test series in December last year
 doharty ne ‘sidney marning herald’ se kaha, ‘‘maine bharat england siries darshak ke bajaay shodhakarta kii tarah dekhi
 "he said," But i will see the footage of the way he bowled again
 swaan or panesar ne unke akraman kii aguwai kii or england ne siries jeet lee
 '' bharatiyon ko spin khilne main maahir mana jaataa he lekin england ke greem swaan or monti panesar ne pichley saal disambar main test siries main bhartiya khilaadiyon ko kaaphi pareshaan kiya
 Doherty told the Sydney Morning Herald, "I saw the India England series as a researcher rather than a spectator
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘lekin jis tarah se unhone gendbaaji kii, uske footage main dobaaraa dekhuunga
 Swann and Panesar led their attack and England won the series

 There are speculations that he committed suicide due to failure of love affair with actor Aditya Pancholi and Zarina Wahab's son Suraj Pancholi
 raabia khan ne kaha, yah dil todane vaala he
 
 
 unbelievable
 
 Why did he do this? When someone is suffering, mentally and emotionally disturbed, he does not know what he is doing or what action he is taking
 vah bahut jujharu thi
 They said, she was very spiritual
 vah apni bahanon ko salaah detii thi
 Being the elder sister she was protective of him
 yah jaanakar bahut aashcharya hota he ki vah andar se kitni kamjor thi
 We can't believe he did it
 ghatana vaale din ko yaad karti hui raabia ne kaha, ham raat saadhe aath baje ke aasapaas baahar the or jiya ko apni ek chacheri bahan ke saath america sho dekhnaa tha
 i was at a friend's house
 hamane taxt sandeshon se baat kii
 It is almost half past nine
 agar mujhe uski maansik haalat kaa pataa hota, to us din use akeli ghar par nahin chhodti
 On 11 June, police arrested Suraj, son of actor Aditya Pancholi, based on a six-page letter allegedly written by the actress
 andar tak tuuti hui jiya ne is suicide note main us kathith 'maansik aghat or durvyavhaar' ke bare main likhaa he, jo use apane premi (patr main naam nahin likhaa he) ke haathon jhelana padaa
 a case of abetment of suicide for 22-year-old Suraj has been registered
 tippaniyan Rabia said in sorrow, her love did not get respect and acceptance
 kuch maah pehle jab jiya raabia se milane landan gai thi, to usne apni maa ko suraj ke saath pareshaani bhare apane is rishte ke bare main bataaya tha
 Rabia said, This year when she came to London in February for her birthday, i noticed that she had lost her face
 ek maa hone ke naate main yah mahasoos kar sakati thi
 When i asked her, she started crying
 maine usase poocha ki kya aisa uske kariyar kii vajah se he yaa phir filmon main der ho rahi he? is par vah foot-footkar kuch aise rone lagi maano uske dil main koi gaharaa dard ho
 Rabia told, we asked him if it is about Suraj, then he said that he does not respect him, uses dirty language for him and kills him
 maine use saaf kaha ki vah tumhaare liye nahin he
 We asked her to break up with the boy
 hamane vahi karne kaa faisla kiya, jo use pasand thim or hamane use vyast rakhane kii koshish kii
 She returned to normal and looked happy
 maine use samajhaayaa ki ek rishte main kis tarah se thodaa spes diya jaataa he or kis tarah aapako khud ko vyast rakhana chahie
 us-born 25-year-old actress Zia Khan was found hanging on the noose on June 3 at her residence
 aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki abhinayta aditya pancholi or jarina wahaab ke bete suraj pancholi ke saath prem sambandhon ke naakaam rahane par unhone aatmahatya kii
 It is heartbreaking, said Rabia Khan
 
 
 yakeen nahin hota
 
 usne aisa kyon kiya? jab koi behaal hota he, maansik or bhaavnaatmak taur par pareshaan hota he, to vah nahin jaanata ki vah kya kar rahaa he yaa kya kadam uthaa rahaa he
 She was very combative
 unhone kaha, vah bahut aadhyatmik thi
 She used to give advice to her sisters
 badi bahan hone ke naate vah unke liye surakshatmak thi
 It is very surprising to know how weak she was from inside
 hamen yakeen nahin hota ki usne aisa kiya

 As a mother i could feel it
 maine usase poocha, to vah rone lagi
 i asked her whether this was due to her career or if films were delayed
 At this she began to cry bitterly as if there was a deep pain in her heart
 raabia ne bataaya, hamane use poocha ki kya yah suraj ko lekar he, to usne kaha ki vah uski izzat nahin karata, uske liye gandi bhashaa kaa istemaal karata he or use martha he
 i told him clearly that he is not for you
 hamane use us ladke se sambandh tod lene ke liye kaha

 UPTET 2019 Admit Card Download linkuptet 2019 Admit Card: upitate admit card jari, is diarect link se karen downlod a post shared by Voompla (@voompla) on May 8, 2018 at 2:15 am PDT apane bhakton par aashirwad barasaane vaali or khud ko devi kaa avatar bataane vaali radhe maa jaise hi dahej utpeedan ke liye uksaane ke iljaam main fansi, unhen bhi 'maa' kii yaad aa hi gai
 Now-a-days Radhe Maa is sometimes taking a round of the temple of Mumba Devi, sometimes in the gurudwara, sometimes at the dargah
 jis din se radhe maa par ek ladki ne uske sasuralwaalon ko dahej ke liye uksaane kaa aarope lagaaya he usee din seradhe maa ke sitaregardish main aa gaye hai
 On Saturday, while the entire Hindustan was celebrating Independence Day, Radhe Maa was going to Kalba Devi in mumbai to see Mumba Devi
 giraftaar ho sakati hai radhe maaapako bataa den ki ek ladki ke sasuraal waalon ko dahej ke liye uksaane ke iljam se gheriradhe maa ke sir par giraftaarki talwaar latak rahi he
 The court has currently stayed his arrest for two weeks and in this case he was also questioned by the police for 5 hours at the Kandivali police station on 14 August
 isi silsile main unhen dobaaraa 19 or 26 taarikh ko police stesan main hajiri deni he
 That is, the coming days are not going to bring any good news for Radhe Maa
 ek radhe maa or vivaad hajaarradhe maa se jude vivaadon kii pherahist lambii hoti ja rahi he
 At present, Radhe Maa is accused of spreading illiteracy, tearing the house, asking for dowry
 lekin isse pehle wo khud ko devi kaa rup bataane par vivaad par fansi to kabhi unke mahamandaleshwar banane par vivaad khadaa ho gaya
 Questions have started to arise whether Radhe Maa killed the same guru who gave her initiation to religion and spirituality and made her Radhe Maa from Babbo? Another disciple of the same guru and a guru brother of Radhe Maa have to say something similar
 ye haal ke dinon main radhe maa par lage iljaamon main shaayad sabase sangeen iljaam he
 On hearing the name of Shyamsunder Das Radhe Maa, the Guru Bhai of Radhe Maa and Mahant of a temple in Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, weeps
 darasal, guru bhai mahant shyamsundar das kaa kahana he ki radhe maa ne hi par apane guru mahant ramadhin das paramhans ke katl karvaa diya
 According to Mahant Shyamsunder, Radhe Maa alias Babbo had taken her and her mentor Mahant Ramadhin Das Paramahamsa to Australia many years ago
 lekin jab wo waapas laute to unki haalat behad kharaab thi
 He was counting his last breaths
 haalat ye ho gai ki guruji vakt se pehle duniya chhod gaye
 The charges of 'chicken eats Radhe Maa' do not end here
 unki maane to radhe maa khud koi mahant he hi nahin kyonki wo drink bhi karti hai or nonvej bhi khaati he
 Probably the effect of this opposition is that just like TV celebrity Dolly Bindra, these Guru Bhai of Radhe Maa herself is starting to feel afraid of Radhe Maa
 aage padhein, kaise babbo se radhe maa ban gai sukhwinder cor
 
 
 The whole story of becoming a Radhe Maa from Babbo, Radhe Maa is seen by the whole world today in the incarnation of a saint
 lekin unka bhi ek ateet rahaa he
 a past, which seems to be immersed in the shadow of Muflissi and Gurbat, but the question is what miracle happened in the last few years with Radhe Maa, due to which she became a goddess and millions upon seeing Raised the empire of? Sukhwinder Kaur, who once lived in Hoshiarpur in her village in Muflissi, became Radhe Maa in a few years
 1969 main punjab ke gurdaspur jile ke dorangla gaanv main paidaa huisukhwinder kaurahai
 In childhood, Sukhwinder used to be affectionately called Babloo and Gudiya
 gudiya ne dasvin tak padhai kii
 After this, the family members married her
 shaadi hoshiyarpur ke mukeria gaanv main rahane vaale manmohan singh naam ke ek mithaiwale se hui
 Radhe Ma also had 2 children, but there was a loss in the shop, Radhe Ma's husband Manmohan took the way to the Gulf countries to earn and here Radhe Ma started stitching people's clothes
 ek wo din tha, ek ye din henisi bich ek roj wo param mahant baag ke mahant ramadhin paramhans kii sharan main ja pahunchin
 Paramhansa initiated Sukhvinder for six months and gave a new name- Radhe Maa
 bas, ek wo din tha or ek aaj kaa din
 Radhe Ma never looked back
 dhire-dhire radhe maa ne khud ko devi kaa avatar ghoshit karnaa shuru kar diya
 Started awakening in various places in Punjab
 kai jagah virodh bhi jhelana padaa or isi virodh kii vajah se radhe maa punjab se nikaalkar maharashtra ja pahunchi
 Started living in the house of a rich businessman and continued to grow illusion
 kai logon kaa kahana he ki ye marketing he
 Is hypocrisy
 aadambar he
 But Radhe Maa claims that all this is her devotion
 shakti he
 Whatever may be the truth, one truth is that there is no dearth of devotees of Radhe Maa today
 yoga guru baba ramdev ne bharatiyon se maid in china products kaa bahishkaar karne kii apil kii he

 ek angreji akhbaar ke kaarykram main jab baba ramdev se poocha gaya ki pakistani kalakaaron ko bharat main bain karne par unki raay kya he to unhone jawaab diya 'kalakaar aatankwaadi nahin hote hai
 But do these people have a soul? These people only think about their films, earn crores and eat biryani
 ye log uri or duusari jagahon par hue aatankwaadi hamalon main bhartiya sainikon kii shahadat par kuch kyon nahin bolte?''pakistan main yoga camp ke liye taiyaar'haalanki ramdev ne kaha ki unhen pakistan main yoga camp lagane se gurej nahin he, kyonki yoga bhi ek kala he
 He said that he is also ready to set up a Patanjali unit in Pakistan, but like the Pakistani artists, they will not make profit from it but will work for the good of the Pakistani people by earning what they earn
 sargical strike kii tarif karte hue ramdev bole ki dushton kaa naash karnaa hinsa nahin hoti
 He said that PM Modi should also eliminate Dawood Ibrahim, Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed
 jab ramdev se poocha gaya ki ve endie sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se khush hai yaa nahin to unhone jawaab diya ki ek yogi kabhi khush yaa naakhush nahin hota
 He feels that Narendra Modi will prove to be the most successful Prime Minister of the country
 rafeldlavivaad abhi bhi tak khatm nahin hua he
 Meanwhile, on Thursday, the country's Raksha Mantri Mirnirmala Sitharaman made a big disclosure
 unhone kaha ki sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (upie) sarkaar ke samay 126rafelget vimaanon kii kharid kaa qaraar hindustan aronutics li
 Parwan could not climb due to (HAL) 's poor health
 samachar agency pitiai ke mutabik, nirmala sitaraman ne kaha ki HAL ke paas francisi company dasolt aviation ke saath mil kar bharat main is ladaaku vimaan ke vinirmaan ke liye jaruri kshamta hi nahin thi or saarvajanik kshetra kii yah company kaam kii guarantee dene kii sthiti main nahin thi
 He also said that the intervention of then Defense Minister AK Antony in 2013 served as the last nail in the coffin of the exercise being done to deal with these aircraft at that time
 rakshaamantri ke mutabik, antni ne us samay hastkshep kiya jabaki laagat par baatcheet karne vaali samiti is saude ko antim rup de rahi thi
 On Antony's intervention, he said that the then defense minister had blocked the file at a level where he had no role
 haalanki, unhone antni dwaara aisa karne kii koi vajah nahin bataai
 Sitharaman said that after several rounds of negotiations with HAL, French company Dassault Aviation realized that if Rafale jet is produced in India, its cost would go up significantly
 unhone kaha, ‘‘dasolt company echeel ke saath baatcheet ko isliye aage nahin badha saki kyonki yadi vimaan kaa utpaadan bharat main hota, to vinirmit kiye jane vaale utpaada ke liye guarantee dene kii jarurat hoti
 It is an expensive product and the Indian Air Force would like a guarantee for the jet
 echeel is tarah kii guarantee dene kii sthiti main nahin thi
 The Defense Minister said that the weapons system, aeronautics and other additions of the Rafale aircraft would be far superior to the negotiations during the UPA
 unhone daawa kiya unki sarkaar ne vimaan kii keemat ke bare main jo qaraar kiya he uske tahat ye vimaan us sayam kii sahmati se 9 pratishat kam keemat par hasil kar rahi he
 Its supply is expected to start from September 2019
 gauratlab he ki purvavarti samprag sarkaar ne 2012 main france kii dasolt aviation ke saath 126 medium multi role ladaaku vimaan (mmrsie) kharidne ke liye molbhav shuru kiya tha
 Dassault Aviation was supposed to supply 18 Rafale jets in full ready condition, while 108 aircraft were being manufactured in India with the company in collaboration with HAL
 congress lagaataar 36 rafel jet saude kii aalochana kar rahi he
 The Congress alleges that the government is procuring this aircraft at a rate of Rs 1,670 crore per aircraft, while the UPA government had finalized a price of Rs 526 crore for it
 is par sitaraman ne kaha ki 526 karod rupee kaa aankada sirf vimaan ke liye he jo sirf udaan bhar saktaa he or utar saktaa he
 It does not include aeronautics, weapons and other associated technology that make it a fully combat machine

 When g Bopaiah was appointed as the Protem Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, the Congress reached the Supreme Court in the night against this decision too
 lekin supreme ne apane faisle main kaha ki bopaiya protem spikar bane rahenge
 Actually, Yeddyurappa has to prove his majority in the assembly today, but before that the Congress wanted to cancel the appointment of the Protem Speaker
 mana ja rahaa he ki congress ke is virodh kii vajah ke
 Zee Bopaiah has a past, leaving the Congress in awe
 duusari vajah ye bhi ki aaj vidhansabha main agar congress ke vidhayak baghawat karte hai, to aise main spikar kii bhoomika behad ahm ho jaaegi
 Yeddyurappa's close-knit pro tem speaker
 ji bopaiya bies yediurppa ke najdiki maane jate hai
 In the past too, he has played with Yeddyurappa
 2009 se 2013 tak vah karnataka vidhansabha ke spikar rahe hai or isse pehle 2008 main vah protem spikar bhi niyukt kiye gaye the
 On 12 October 2010, when BJP mlas were opposing their own government inside the House in the illegal mining case, Bopaiah as Speaker had disqualified 11 rebel mlas and 5 Independents
 is faisle se yediurppa ke netritv vaali bijepi sarkaar batch gai thi
 However, the Supreme Court later upheld Bopaiah's decision
 court ne apane faisle main kaha tha ki bopaiya ne pakshpaat kiya or swaabhaavik nyaay tak kaa ulanghan kiya
 'protem speaker was also formed in 2008, the same situation which was seen in the formation of government, a similar situation was born in 2008 also
 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi 110 siton ke saath sabase badi party banakar ubhari thi, lekin use apane dam par bahumat hasil nahin hua tha
 Congress had 80 mlas, JDS 28 and 6 Independents

 K
 in the assembly ji bopaiya ne hi bataur protem spikar vidhayakon ko shapath dilaai thi
 Yeddyurappa formed the government with independents, but with his support, he did not want to play the entire innings
 isliye yediurppa ne vidhansabha main apni sankhya badhaane ke liye 7 vipakshi vidhayakon par dore daale
 If these mlas had come directly into the BJP, they would have lost their membership in the anti-defection law
 isliye pehle inhone istipha diya phir bijepi main shaamil ho gaye
 After this, all these seven contested on BJP ticket in the by-elections and 5 of them won
 is hisaab se yediurppa ke paas 115 vidhayak ho gaye
 The Congress had challenged Bopaiah's appointment in the Supreme Court only on the basis of earlier decisions
 yahaan tak ki sunwaayee ke dauraan congress ke vakil kapil sibbal ne court main ye kaha ki bopaiya kaa itihaas daagdar rahaa he or court ke saamne oparation lotus kaa zikr kiya
 However, the court ultimately ordered Bopaiah to prove his majority

 Former Gujarat DIG DG Vanzara, accused in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case, has resigned from the Indian Police Service
 vanjaaraa ne gujarat sarkaar ko 10 pannon kii chitthee likhi he, jisamen rajya ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or unke kareebi amit shah par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Targeting the Modi government, Vanzara wrote that he and the police officers working with him stood with the government like a dam during the crisis, but the government was disappointed during his crisis
 unhone aarope lagaaya he ki gujarat sarkaar ne jail main band police adhikariyon kii koi madad nahin kii
 Work is being carried out only through word of mouth which proved to be hollow
 modi sarkaar sibiai se sirf apni chamadi bachaane main juty he or mudde kaa raajnneetik phayda uthaa rahi he
 Whereas after the arrest of Amit Shah, the government immediately came into action
 ab amit shah sahit modi sarkaar par bharose kii koi vajah nahindiji vanjaaraa ne likhaa he, 'amit shah par jab cese chalaa to unhen bachaane main puri rajya sarkaar lag gai
 Lawyers like Jethmalani were called for him
 amit shah ne apane mukademe transfar karvaa liye or hamen jail main pade rahane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 i and my officers felt cheated by the government's attitude
 ab amit shah sahit modi sarkaar par bharose kii koi vajah nahin he
 'for me God was no longer on Modi
 
 
 vanjaaraa ne likhaa he, 'main aaj tak is mudde par isliye chup rahaa kyonki meraa vishwaas rajya ke mukhyamantri narendra bhai modi ke prati adig tha
 i considered the Chief Minister of Gujarat as God
 par bade dukh ke saath kah rahaa hum ki meraa yah bhagwaan jarurat ke vakt par mere saath nahin khadaa tha
 The reason for this is Amit Shah, who has misled Modi for the last 12 years
 'hamaare kaaran bahadur kehalaae modi, par bhul gaye hamaara karj chukanavanjaraa ne likhaa he, 'modi sahi kehete hai ki unhen bharat mata kaa karj chukaana he
 But he forgot to pay the debt of the jailed policemen in a hurry to go to Delhi
 modi un sabhi pulicekarmiyon kaa karj chukaana bhul gaye jinhone modi bahadur mukhyamantri kaa tamgaa dilvaaya
 'the worst condition of the police in Gujarat has written,' To my knowledge there is no such state in the country where so many policemen have been arrested or are being held, that too for so long
 sabase ahm baat yah ki rajya kaa nishthavan sipaahi hone ke baavjood un pulicekarmiyon ko jail main torchar kiya ja rahaa he

 Ekta Kapoor's show Kasauti remains in the limelight but has failed to make it to the TRP ratings
 sho ko interesting banane ke liye bharsak prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Hina Khan was brought on to play Vamp Komolika in the show
 ab sho main aamanaa sharif ai hai, lekin donon kaa jaadu phens ke sir chadhakar kitna bol rahaa he, jaaniye
 
 
 Hina Khanbig, who was dominating in Big Boss, had a lot of expectations from the famous Hina Khan by creating a negative image in Boss
 lag rahaa tha ki hina khan jis tarah big bos main chai raheen vaise hi kasuti jindagi kii sho main jam jaaengi
 But Hina did not show anything special in the show
 baad main hina khan ne profeshnal kamitment ke chalate sho chhod diya
 Now Aamna Sharif was brought on the show
 beete dinon sho main aamanaa kii entry hui
 Aamna has appeared in a TV show after a long time
 parde par apni maasoomiyat se logon ko prabhavit karne vaali aamanaa ko negative kirdaar main dekhne phens kaaphi baichen the
 Aamna's entry also seemed like it might bring some life to the show, but Aamna's entry in the show also could not gain much in TRP
 lekin comolikaa ke role main aamanaa ko kaaphi pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 Talking about looks, both Hina and Aamna were seen in the same getup
 lekin phens ko aamanaa kaa luk hina se zyada pasand aa rahaa he
 When Aamna's first look was revealed in Komolika's getup, it became quite viral
 blue dress or haivi julri main aamanaa jach rahi thim
 Seeing Aamna in Komolika's getup, it would not be wrong to say that the magic of 'nika' has gone
 urvashi dholkiyaake aasapaas bhi nahin hina-aamanaagar atitude kii baat kii jaae to phens kaa maananaa he ki hina khan vamp ke role main overacting karti najar ain
 At the same time, Amna is trying to become a vamp
 ek vamp ke rup main jo gussa, paagalpan or sanak chahie wo donon hi actresses main dekhne ko nahin mila
 Whether the role of Komolika was done by Hina or Aamna but neither of them is seen around Urvashi Dholakia
 urvashi dholkia ne vamp kaa jo kairactor pakadaa tha, ye donon hi actress usamen feet nahin baith pai hai
 The daughter-in-law's image has not been dropped yet
 aamanaa ko kairactor main jaan daalane ke liye kadi mehnat kii jarurat he
 She was the first singer to receive the Bharat Ratna
 magsese award jeetne vaali bhi ve pehali thim or sanyukt raashtra main apni gayaki pesh karne vaali bhi

 yah unhone us vakt kiya jab ve kariyar ke shikhar par thim
 If you want to book their concert, then they used to ask you to give them a check which is made in the name of any charitable trust
 ek baar ek ratribhoj main unhone apni heere kii kaan kii baaliyaan utarkar aayojakon ko saunp deen or kaha ki jaruratmandon ke liye kosh bananaa shuru karo
 These diamonds were for Muridas like us, to enjoy their sparkle and beauty, but for them they were superficial decorations and ornaments
 log keval unki aadhyatmikta or daansheeltaa kii baaten karte hai
 i sometimes wonder if this is to take away their musicality from them
 unka sangeet behad bauddhik tha
 His treasure was indeed very vast
 main khushkismat thi ki mujhe unhen jindagi ke aakhri padaav par kareeb se dekhne kaa mauka mila
 Yet when the end comes to a close, when you have to leave, you feel like an orphan and disembodied boat
 jab maine aakhri baar unhen dekha, unhone marun rang kii resham kii sari pahani thi, gulab kii pankhudiiyon ne unhen dhak rakhaa tha or ve hameshaa kii tarah khushboodaar or tarotaaja dikhaai de rahi thim
 Even today when i sing, only my lips are shaking
 mere dimag ke tahkhaane main lagaataar bajte tepe recorder kii tarah em
 s
 ammaa kii aawaaj hoti he jiskaa anusaran karne kii koshish main karti rahati hum

 Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha has targeted Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 nitish kumaar ke endie main aane ke baad se kushvaha un par sidhe hamale se bachate rahe hai, lekin ravivaar ko mujffarpur main unke tevar badale hue najar aae
 The reason for this is that a day ago, on Saturday, on the India Today SOS Bihar forum, when Nitish Kumar was asked questions on the statement of RLSP leader and Union Minister Kushwaha, he talked about keeping the level of conversation high
 upendra kushvaha ne is par nitish kumaar se hi puch liya ki unki diene report ai yaa nahin
 In 2015, in the same Muzaffarpur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had questioned Nitish Kumar's DNA while starting the election campaign
 aaj unheen ke mantri kushvaha ne report kii maang kar di
 Today in # halla_bol_darwaja_kholam Mahasammelan: - Respected @ nitishkumar ji, you and i are from the lav-kush family, so how did you rise to the high and low level? Did i and my # ralospasathi honor and judge the poor, the exploited, the oppressed and the deprived? Struggling from house to road, hence the following? Pic

 lekin mere bade bhai nitish kumaar ne hajaaron kaaryakartaaon ke bal or nakhun dilli bhej die, pataa nahin apana bal yaa nakhun bheja tha yaa nahin

 The next general election must be contested in the face of someone else
 kushvaha ke isi sawaal ko lekar ye sara maamla saamne aayaa he
 Kushawaha said, 'I feel sad that elder brother called me a lowly, how have i become inferior when we are from Love and Kush society
 ' unhone raily main kaha, 'jab nitish kumaar se meri party ke bare main sawaal poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki baatcheet ke neeche str tak na jaaen

 What Nitish said in the name of Kushwaha is that Nitish Kumar talked about lowering the level of conversation, but Kushwaha said that Nitish Kumar called him a lowly
 unhone kaha ki wo dalit pichde kii aarakshan kii baat karte hai, isliye neech hai, vah saamaajik nyaay kii baat karte hai isliye neech hai kya?teen se zyada seat kii maang doharirashtriya lok samta party is baar pichley loksabhaa chunaav se zyada siton par chunaav ladanaa chaahati he
 Party's national president Upendra Kushwaha said in Muzaffarpur on Sunday that he wanted an honorable agreement on seat sharing in the Lok Sabha elections
 pichley chunaav ko hue paanch saal biit gaye
 The strength of his party is steadily increasing
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main teen siten milin thim jin par unki party ko jeet mili thi
 This time, their strength should not be undermined by the alliance partners
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main jediu endie main phir shaamil hui he
 Because of this, along with the BJP Lok Janshakti Party, the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party is also having to reduce its seats

 prashanth kishor ek baar phir surkhiyon main hai
 It is now being said that he has a disagreement with Congress President Capt Amarinder in Punjab
 vajah bataai ja rahi he prashanth kishor kii congress se nishkasit do netaaon se mulaakaat, jisase captain naaraaz hai or prashanth ko aukaat main rahane kii baat kah rahe hai
 That is, the captain will decide who will meet Prashant Kishore and who will not
 prashanth ko aukaat main rahane main kii baat congress mukhyalay main baithe kuch netaa bhi kar rahe hai, jo kai rajyon ke prabharee to hai magar khud chunaav nahin jeet sakate
 Some time ago when Rahul Gandhi was asked what role of Prashant Kishore would play in the Congress, he had clearly stated that he would take charge of campaigning in Punjab because nowadays the election campaign is different from before
 kai tarah ke prachaar ke medium maujuud hai, jisamen maharath hasil karnaa kisi netaa ke vash kii baat nahin he
 He needs a professional and Prashant Kishore has proved himself in that
 phir chaahe vah bijepi ke liye 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav ho or phir nitish kumaar ke liye 2015 main
 
 
 But some leaders who do drawing room politics in the Congress are not feeling this way
 prashanth kishor ne enditivi india se baatcheet main kaha ki unka kisi se bhi koi matbhed nahin he or unhen jo kaam diya gaya he use ve karenge
 Kishore said that i am thankful that the party has given me this task, which i am doing sincerely
 prashanth kishor kii bhoomika congress ke kuch netaaon ko isliye khatak rahi hogi ki vah sidhe rahul gandhi ko report karte hai or unki team kaa hissaa hai
 In Uttar Pradesh, he has met all the block level leaders when he said that Rahul or Priyanka should take the command in their hands
 aisa feedback lagbhag uttar pradesh ke sabhi block pramukhon ne apane vichaar main kaha he
 The comments congress ke sabhi netaaon ko shaayad yah jaankaree na ho ki prashanth kishor ne apane kariyar kii shuruyaat rahul gandhi ke saath hi kii thi
 Even then, the same thing happened that Rahul could not get him the freedom he wanted in Congress
 tab prashanth kishor bijepi ke saath ho liye
 In order to take credit for the victory in the Lok Sabha elections, Prashant's leaders shied away and went to Nitish Kumar
 darasal, ek profeshnal hone ke naate prashanth apane aapako sabit karnaa chaahate the or bihar chunaav main unhone yah sabit kar diya ki yadi sahi ranneeti ho or netaa kaa aap par vishwaas ho to aap chunaav main dhan, bal,satta or dushprachaar tak ko maat de sakate hai
 Congress leaders have to understand that Prashant Kishore is the compulsion of Congress or the compulsion of Prashant is Congress
 congress jaisi party main in sabake baad bhi prashanth kishor ke paas chunauti hogi ki punjab main vah congress kii duubati naiya paar laga paaenge yaa nahin, kyonki 74 saal ke captain ke saath 39 saal ke prashanth kaa talmail bithaana utana aasaan nahin he
 If the Congressman loses, then the Congress will not immediately stop losing the blow to Prashant's head and will say that i was already saying that nothing is overrated from it

 magar congress main drawing room politics karne vaale kuch netaaon ko yah raas nahin aa rahaa he
 Prashant Kishore told NDTV India that he had no differences with anyone and would do the work given to him
 kishor ne kaha ki main is baat kaa abhaari hum ki party ne mujhe yah kaam saunpa he, jise main puri eemaandaaree se kar rahaa hum
 Prashant Kishore's role must be knocking off some Congress leaders because he reports directly to Rahul Gandhi and is part of his team
 uttar pradesh main unhone sabhi block str ke netaaon se mulaakaat kii he tab jaakar kaha ki vahaan kii kaman khud rahul yaa priyanka ko apane haath main leni chahie
 Such feedback has been said by almost all the block heads of Uttar Pradesh in their opinion
 tippaniyan Not all Congress leaders are aware that Prashant Kishore started his career with Rahul Gandhi
 tab bhi yahi baat hui thi ki jitani aazaadee vah chaahate the vah congress main rahul bhi unhen nahin dilaa paae
 Then Prashant Kishore joined BJP
 loksabhaa chunaav main jeet kaa shrey lene ke chakkar main prashanth kaa netaaon ne kinaaraa kiya to nitish kumaar ke paas chale gaye
 Actually, Prashant being a professional wanted to prove himself and in Bihar elections he proved that if the right strategy is there and the leader has faith in you, then you beat the money, force, power and propaganda in the election
 Can
 congress netaaon ko yah samajhnaa hoga ki prashanth kishor congress kii majaburi he yaa prashanth kii majaburi congress he
 Even after all this in a party like Congress, Prashant Kishore will have a challenge whether he will be able to overcome the drowning of the Congress in Punjab because it is not easy to reconcile 39 years of Prashant with 74-year-old captain
 yadi haare to congressi turant haar kaa thikra prashanth ke sir par phodne se nahin chukenge or bolenge main to pehle hi kah rahaa tha ki isse kuch nahin hone vaala overrated he

 RJD (rashtriya Janata Dal) candidate from Pataliputra Lok Sabha seat of Bihar, Misa Bharti, during the election campaign, attacked JDU (janata Dal United) leader Sanjay Singh for calling him a 'shurpanakha'
 'ajtak' se exclusive baatcheet karte hue misa bharti ne kaha ki desh kii mahilaon ko bhartiya janata party (bijepi) or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke netaaon se isi prakaar kii bhashaa kii apeksha he
 Misa Bharti said that disrespecting women is a ritual of leaders of BJP and RSS

 Misa said that the BJP feared that if Lalu Prasad would remain out of jail on bail, he would not get even 1 to 2 seats in Bihar
 misa ne kaha ki patliputra loksabhaa kshetra main prachaar ke dauraan vah apane pita kii kami ko kaaphi mahasoos kar rahi hai
 He said that Lalu Prasad is not an individual but an ideology and the whole of Bihar stands with him
 misa ne patliputra se bijepi ummidavaar or kendriya mantri ramkripal yadav par bhi jamkar hamalaa bolaa or aarope lagaaya ki unhone gramin vikaas mantri hote hue bhi pichley 5 saalon main apane kshetra kaa koi vikaas nahin kiya
 Misa Bharti said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah are scared of the Lalu family
 isiilie lagaataar patliputra loksabhaa kshetra main chunavi sabhaayen kar rahe hai

 It is said that nothing is wasted in life and when the time comes, every thing that you have learned from the heart, goes by giving its fruit
 kyon na is baar apni chhuttiyon ko aise hi bekaar na jane den or kuch aisa karen, jisamen dil bhi lag jaae or seekhney ko bhi khub mil jaae
 There is something special in every child and the summer vacation gives the children a full chance to identify their hidden talent

 Even for the children writing and reading, summer vacation is no less than a 'summer bonanza'
 class main hameshaa aage rahane vaale ye bachche holiday homework ke alaava bhi in chhuttiyon main apni nolej badhaane ke liye english spiking course, persenelity develpment yaa phir tele jaise course kar sakate hai
 Children with interest in the field of accounts can do 'tele' course which proves to be very beneficial in terms of career
 4

 aapako bataa den ki agar aap fahrren langvej sahi dhang se sikh lete hai to isaki madad se sidhi job bhi mil sakati he or wo bhi moti selary vaali

 (input bhashaa se) In the eyes of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the word Bharat and Bharatiya do not have as wide a meaning as a Hindu
 bharat se sirf ek bhukhand or desh kaa hi abhas hota he, jabaki hindu kahalaane se vyapak rup se samskruti or aadhyatmik parampara kaa bhi bodh hota he
 However the RSS does not consider a special difference between the words Indian and Hindu
 phir bhi uski najar main hindu shabd zyada uchit maaloom padataa he
 In the 'knowledge Series', the RSS revealed what is more appropriate in the words Indian and Hindu
 darasal, aresas ab apni vichaardhaara or darshan ke bare main adhik se adhik jaankaree janata tak pahunchane main juta he
 The organization has launched a 'know the Union' campaign
 vichaardhaara se judi baton ko or spasht kiya ja rahaa he
 So that there is clarity about RSS, from Sangh supporters to common people and opponents
 sangh kya he, kaise kaam karata he, hindutv kii vichaardhaara kya he, sangh kaa darshan kya he, sangh kis tarah kaa raashtra or samaaj nirmaan chahta he? aise tamaam jwalanth sawaalon kaa aresas ne saarvajanik rup se jawaab dena shuru kar diya he
 The two top leaders of the union, Drs
 krishna gopal or manmohan vaidya aapasi samvaad ke jariye muddon ko spasht kar rahe hai
 Union sources say that all baseless things are blown from the level of opponents regarding the organization
 aise main sangh kii ore se soshal media ke jariye bhi logon tak apni baaten pahunchaai ja raheen
 The World Dialogue Center is playing a special role in this
 sangh ke sah sarkarywah dow
 Recently, a similar dialogue has taken place between Krishnagopal and Manmohan Vaidya in which Hindu or Indian? The issue is discussed
 11 june ko vishwa samvaad centre ke you-tub channel par uplabdh is charchaa main bhartiya ke mukaable hindu shabd ko zyada arth dene vaala bataaya gaya he
 The word Hindu is foreign, but in the scriptures, the Church, the RSS (RSS) also recognizes that the term Hindu is used more by foreigners
 charchaa ke dauraan sangh ke sah sar kaarywah dow krishna gopal se sarkarywah manmohan vaidya poochhate hai ki hindu shabd puranic nahin he
 Is not even ancient
 aadhunik he
 Foreigners have given it? On this, Krishna Gopal says that this is true
 vaicharik drushti se bhale donon shabd samanaarthi hi hai
 However, the word Bharat has a greater sense of geographical identity
 pichley dedh hajaar saal se 'hindu' shabd samaaj ke andar bahut gaharaa baith gaya he
 From Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Sindh, Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan to Manipur and Assam, the word Hindu deepened
 pichley dedh hajaar saal main hindu shabd kaa prachlan adhik hota chalaa gaya
 It is not that the word Hindu is not mentioned in the ancient texts
 vishnu puraana main bahut sundar varnan he
 The whole society, which lived from the Himalayas to Indu lake, was called Hindu society
 isamen kaha gaya he- himalayt samaarbhy yavat indu sarovaram
 Desam Hindustan Prachakshate, who created the god
 
 In this, the society that exists from the Himalayas down to the sea has been described as Hindu society
 hindu shabd zyada arth detaa haimanmohan vaidya ke saath charchaa main sangh netaa dow
 Krishna Gopal says that the feeling of being geographical by the word 'bharat' is more and less spiritual
 jabaki 'hindu' shabd se aadhyatmik bhav zyada paidaa hota he
 Giving an example to Manmohan Vaidya, Krishna Gopal says that when we go to Nepal and say that we have come from India, they think that they have come from abroad
 magar jab ham khud ko hindu kehete hai to unhen lagata he ki apane hi log hai
 In the same way, when we speak of India when we go to America, it seems that we have come from one country, but when we call ourselves Hindus, they feel that there are people with an idea, culture and spiritual tradition
 is prakaar dekhen to hindu shabd vishwa ke liye 'riprogent' karne vaala ho jaataa he
 Whose roots in India are all Hindukun Hindus? Clarifying the issue, Dr
 krishna gopal kehete hai ki islam ke aane ke pehle tak sabhi log hindu kehalaate hai
 When the Hindu Code Bill was introduced in the Constitution, the debate started, it became difficult to explain 'hindu'
 us vakt dow
 Ambedkar interpreted it very well
 unhone sabko samahit karte hue jo mat diya, unke mat ko samvidhan sabha ne bhi sweekaar kiya
 He had said that Shaiva, Vaishnavism, Aryasamaji, Prarthana Samaji, Lingayat would all come to Hindu
 magar unhen jab laga ki is par bhi kuch log chhot rahe hai to dow
 Ambedkar said in the Hindu Code Bill, "all those who are not Muslims, Parsis, Jews, will be called Hindus
 " is prakaar dekhen to kisi bhi janajati ke log, chaahe kahin bhi rahete hon, agar unka 'origin' bhartiya he to vah hindu hai
 Even if they belong to any sect, vote
 bharat or australia ke bich test siries kaa teesraa match guuruuvaar ko jharkhand ke ranchi cricket stadium main khelaa jayega
 The name of former Ranchi captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni first comes to mind, due to which Ranchi got recognition in the cricket world
 ranchi pehali baar kisi bhi test match kii mejabani karne ja rahaa he, kisi bhi stadium ke liye kaaphi badi baat he
 But while the Ranchi stadium would be creating this history, the 'prince of Ranchi' would not be included in Team India at that time
 ranchi kaa stadium bharat main test cricket kaa aayojan karwaane vaala 26 stadium hoga
 Dhoni had played the dhol, the first ODI match was held on 19 January 2013 in Ranchi, before that everyone remembers playing Mahendra Singh Dhoni's dhol and giving emotional speech at the opening event a day before the start of the stadium
 tab dhoni ne kaha tha ki jab unhone cricket kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi, tab bahut mushkil hota tha bataanaa ki vah kahaan se aaen hai, lekin stadium banane ke baad aisi mushkil nahin aegi
 According to Keshav Banerjee, former coach of Dhoni, the school children will come to see, today due to Dhoni, Ranchi has come to such a big place, we are sad that at this time Dhoni will neither be captain nor join the team
 unhone kaha ki hamanen yahaan par rojaanaa ke 10,000 paas skool ke bacchon ko baante hai, dhoni unke liye star he
 And everyone wants Dhoni to come to watch the Test match
 kumble ko dhoni ke aane kii ummidaranchi test se pehle bhartiya team ke komonil kumbelene kaha ki hamen khushi he ki ham ranchi main test khel rahe hai, hamen pataa he ki dhoni vijay hajaare trophy main vyast hai lekin ham chaahate hai ki vah samay nikaal kar test match dekhne aaen
 Kumble said that we hope that the people of Ranchi will support us in the upcoming Test
 dhoni ne khele hai teen vanderanchi stadium kii shuruyaat ke baad se abhi tak yahaan par kul 4 vanade match hue hai, jinamein se teen match dhoni kii aguwai main khele gaye hai
 In 2013, Dhoni scored 10 runs against England in England, and won the team by hitting fours
 vahiin iske alaava dhoni ne yahaan australia, newjiland ke khilaaf vanade khelaa he
 At the same time, Dhoni scored 9 runs in the only T20 against Sri Lanka played here
 dhoni ne liya tha pich kaa jaijagauratlab he ki kuch din pehle himehendra singh dhonine ranchi test se pehle stadium main jaakar pich kaa jayja liya tha
 From this it can be understood that Dhoni is worried about the match even if he is out of the team or not in Ranchi
 shaayad, unki ore viraat ko ranchi ke liye kuch input bhi mila ho
 Kohli would like to give the gift of victory: Indian captain Virat Kohli himself is not in form, but here he would like to gift the victory to his former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and all the Ranchi spectators by beating Australia
