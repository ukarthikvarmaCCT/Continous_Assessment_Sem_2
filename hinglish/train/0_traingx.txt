 is upanyaas kii krantikari vichaardhaara ne pehle mughalon or baad main angrejon ke gulam ban chuke desh main saamaajik or rajanithik chetana ko jaagrath karne kaa kaam kiya
 This influence was so widespread that 'vande Mataram', a song in the same novel, became the anthem of freedom fighters and later gained national status after the independence of the country
 'aanandamath' ke tab se ab tak na jane kitni bhashaaon main kitne sanskaran chap chuke hai
 Since this novel has become free of copy rights, almost every major publisher has published it
 is upanyaas main saal 1770 se 1774 tak ke bengal kaa chitra khinchaa gaya he! kathanak kii drushti se yah upanyaas yaa aitihaasik upanyaas se badhkar he! maharishi arvind ghosh dwaara 'rashtrawaad kaa rishi' qaraar die gaye bankim ne isamen us yug kaa sirf photo nahin khinchaa, balki raashtra-viplab ke bhanvar main phase kuch aise jeevant manushyon ke chitra prastut kiye hai, jo aaj bhi jeevant he, hamen bade apane lagate hai!'aanandamath' ke kathanak main saamaanya stri-purush bhi hai or mahapurush bhi! bankim aaj bhi apane paatro se hamen rashtrotthana kaa maarg dikhaate hai! yah maarg he sangharsh kaa, anyaay se loha lene kaa! shrimadbhagavadgita kii tarah hi ‘aanandamath’ bhi karam par jor detaa he
 There is no escapism in this! Therefore, the importance 'geeta' got during our freedom struggle was not given less importance to 'anandamath'! It is not only that the song 'vande Mataram' of the children of the novel 'anandamath' became our national anthem! Literature on the death anniversary of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay
 * subsoildoor-spanning forest
 jangal main zyaadaatar ped shawl ke the, lekin inke alaava or bhi kai tarah ke ped the
 The infinite range of trees connected by branches and leaves had gone far
 viched-shunya, chhidr-shunya roshni ke aane ke jaraa se maarg se bhi viheen aise ghaneebhoot patton kaa anant samudr kos dar kos, kos dar kos pawan kii tarangon par tarang chodta hua sarvatra vyaapt tha
 Darkness below
 dopaher main bhi roshni kaa abhaav tha
 Terrible environment
 is jagal ke andar se kabhi koi aadmi nahin gujarata
 Apart from the continuous marbling of leaves and the sound of wild animal birds, no other sound is heard inside this forest
 ek to yah vistrut atyant nibid andhakaarmay jangal, us par raat kaa samay
 It was the second watch of the night
 raat behad kaali thi
 There was darkness outside the forest, nothing was visible
 jangal ke bheetar kaa andhkaar pataal jaise andhkaar kii tarah tha
 The animals and birds were absolutely flushed
 jangal main lakhon-karodon pashu-pakshi, keet-patang rahete the
 Nobody was making any sound
 balki us andhkaar ko anubhav kiya ja saktaa tha, shabdamayi prithvi kaa vah nihshabd bhav anubhav nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In that infinite forest, on that listless bleak night, there was a sudden voice in that inexperienced flushing, "what will not be my wish?" koun kahegaa ki us jangal main kisi aadmi kii aawaaj sunai di thi? kuch der ke baad phir aawaaj hui, phir us nistabdhta ko chirati aadmi kii aawaaj sunai di, ‘‘meri manekamana kya siddh nahin hogi ?’’is prakaar teen baar vah andhkaar samudr aalodit hua, tab jawaab mila, ‘‘tumhaara pran kya he’’‘‘meri jivan-sarvasv
 Life is trivial, all can be discarded
 ’’‘‘or kya he ? or kya don ?’’jawaab mila, ‘‘bhakthi
 " xxrep 4 * First Section - The first passage was the summer of 1176
 aise samay ek padchinh naamak gaanv main bhayaavah garmi pad rahi thi
 There were many houses in the village, but no man could be seen
 bazaar main qatari-dar-qatari dukaane thim, dukaanon main dher sara saamaan tha, gaanv-gaanv main mitti ke saikadon ghar the, bich-bich main oonchi-oonchi attalikaayen
 But today, it was calm all around
 bazaaron main dukaane band thim, dukandaar kahaan bhaag gaye the, iskaa koi thikaana nahin tha
 Today was the day of the Haat, but not a single shop was set up in the Haat
 julahe apane karghe band karke ghar ke ek kone main pade ro rahe the
 Businessmen forgot their business and were crying with children in their arms
 daataaon ne daan band kar diya tha, shikshakon ne paathshaalaayein band kar di thim
 Babies were also crying out of fear
 rajpath par koi najar nahin aa rahaa tha
 There was no one even to take bath in the ponds
 gharon main logon kaa naamon-nishaan nahin tha
 Even animals and birds were not visible
 charne vaali guaen bhi kahin nazar nahin aa rahi thim
 Only in the crematorium were the voices of jackals and dogs echoing
 saamne ek vrihad attalika thi
 His tall domes were visible from a distance
 chote-chote gharon ke jangal main yah attalika shail-shikhar kii tarah shobhaa paa rahi thi
 But what about such beauty - Atalika's doors were closed, there was no gathering of people in the house, no sound anywhere, even the air was not able to enter
 attalika ke andar kamaron main dopaher ke baavjood andhkaar tha
 In that darkness, a couple sitting like withered flowers was thinking
 unke aage akaal kaa raurav failaa hua tha
 The crop did not go well in 1174, and the situation deteriorated in the year 1175 - people were in trouble, despite this, the rulers collected tax for every penny
 is kadai kaa nateeja yah hua ki garibon ke ghar main ek vakt chulhaa jala
 In the year 1175, there was good rainfall during the rainy season
 logon ne sochaa, shaayad devtaa saday hue hai
 So happy, Rakhal sang a song in the field, the farming wife then began to flirt with her husband for silver
 akasmaat aswin maheene devtaa phir vimukh ho gaye
 There was not a single drop of rain in Ashwin and Karthik months
 kheton main dhan sookhkar ekadam khadi ho gayi
 The people who got some paddy, bought it for their soldiers, and the people could not get food
 pehle ek shaam upwas kiya, phir ek bela adpet khaane lage, iske baad do shaamon kaa upwas shuru kiya
 The small crop that was grown in Chaitra did not even bring full grass in anyone's face
 magar kar vasuul karne vaala kartadharta mohammad raja khan kuch or sochataa tha
 He thought, this is the chance to do something
 usne ekadam se das pratishat kar sab par thonk diya
 There was an uproar in all over Bengal
 logon ne pehle bheekh maanganaa shuru kiya, par bheekh unhen kab tak milti
 There was no other option than fasting
 isse yah hua ki ve rogakrant hone lage
 Then people sold cows, sold ox-plows, ate even paddy seeds, sold gates, sold farm-yard
 iske baad kuch na bachaa to ladkiyaan bechnaa shuru kar diya, phir ladke phir patniyaan, ab ladkiyaan, ladke or patniyaan kharidne vaala bhi koi na bachaa
 Buyers did not remain, all were sellers
 khaane kii chizon kaa abhaav aisa darun tha ki log ped ke pattey khaane lage, ghaas khaane lage, tahaniyaan or daaliyaan khaane lage
 Wild and small people started eating dogs, cats and mice
 kai log bhaag gaye, jo bhaage, ve bhi videsh main jaakar bhukhon mar gaye
 Those who did not run away were killed due to disease after being inedible or without diet
 rog ko bhi mauka mil gaya- jahaan dekho, vahiin bukhaar, haija, kshay or chechak ! inamen bhi chechak kaa prakope zyada hi fail gaya tha
 Everybody was dying of smallpox
 koun kise jal de yaa koun kise chhue! na koi kisi kii dawa-daaru kar paata, na koi kisi kii dekhbhaal kar paata or marane par na koi kisi kaa shav uthaa paata
 Even the best houses were filled with the smell
 jis ghar main ek baar chechak pravesh kar jaataa, us ghar ke log rogi ko apane haal par chhod kar bhaag nikalate
 Mahendra Singh Padminh was very wealthy in the village - but today there is no difference between rich and poor
 aisi dukhad sthiti main vyaadhigrast hokar unke samast athmiya swajan das-daasi aadi baari-baari se chale gaye the
 Some had died and some ran away
 us bhare-puure parivaar main ab bache rahe the ve swayan, unki patni or ek shishu kanya
 Telling about him
 unki patni kalyani chintaa tyaag kar goshaala gayi or khud hi gaay duhane lagi
 Then heated the milk and fed it to the girl, after which she went to give water to the cow
 waapas lautakar aayi to mahendra ne poocha, ‘‘is tarah kitne din chalegaa ?’’kalyani boli ‘‘zyada din to nahin
 As many days as i could walk, i would run as many days as i could, after that you would go to the city with your child
 ’’‘‘agar shahar janaa hi he to tumhen itnaa dukh kyon sahane duun
 Come on, let's go at this time
 ’’donon main is vishay par khub tark vitark hone laga
 Kalyani asked, "will there be any special favor by going to the city?" Mahendra replied, "the city may also have a similar public-zero and life-saving solution
 ’’‘‘murshidaabad, kasimbazar yaa kalakatta jaakar shaayad, hamaare praan batch jaaen
 It is perfectly appropriate to leave this place
 ’’mahendra bolaa, ‘‘yah ghar ek arase se peedi-dar-peedi sanchit dhan se paripurna he, ham chale gaye to yah sab chor lootakar le jaaenge
 "" If we come to loot, then how can we save money from thieves? praan hi nahin bache to dhan kaa upbhog koun karegaa ? chalo, isi samay sab kuch baandh-bundh kar yahaan se nikal chalem
 If Pran survived, he will come back and consume them
 ’’mahendra ne poocha, ‘‘tum kya paidal chal sakogi ? palki dhone vaale to sab mar gaye, bail hai to gaadiwan nahin, gaadiwan hai to bail nahin
 "" i can walk, don't you worry
 ’’kalyani ne man hi man tay kar liya tha bhale hi main raste main maari jaaun, phir bhi ye dono to bache rahenge
 The next morning, both of them tied a few rupees in money, locked the door of the house, left the cow and oxen open and picked up the girl in her lap and started traveling towards the capital
 safar ke dauraan mahendra bole, ‘‘rasta behad durgam he
 Robbers are roaming step by step, it is not appropriate to leave empty handed
 ’’ yah kahkar mahendra ghar main waapas gaya or bandook-goli barood uthaa laayaa
 Seeing this, Kalyani said, "if you have remembered the weapon, then you hold on to Sukumari, i also bring a weapon
 ’’ yah kahkar kalyani ne bacchee mahendra kii god main daal di or ghar main ghus gayi
 Mahendra asked, "what weapon will you carry?" Kalyani came into the house and picked up a small bottle of poison and hid it well in the clothes
 in dukh ke dinon main kismat main na jane kab kya bada ho- yahi sochakar kalyani ne pehle hi jehar kaa intjaam kar rakhaa tha
 It was the month of Jeth
 tej dhoop pad rahi thi
 The earth was burning with fire
 hawa main aag machal rahi thi
 The sky was scorching like a hot griddle
 raste kii dhul main aag ke sholay dahak rahe the
 Kalyani got wet with sweat
 kabhi babul ke ped kii chaaya main baith jaati to kabhi khajur ke ped kii
 If there was thirst, the mud of the dried pond would have been drunk
 is tarah behad takalif se vah rasta tay kar rahi thi
 The girl was in Mahendra's lap - Mahendra used to air the girl in between
 chalate-chalate thak gaye to donon hare-hare patton se bhare sangathit phulon se yukt lata veshtit ped kii chaaya main baithkar vishram karne lage
 Mahendra was surprised to see Kalyani's tolerance
 paas hi ek sarovar se vastra bhigokar mahendra ne apana or kalyani kaa munh, haath or sir sinchit kiya
 Kalyani got a little rest, but both got very upset with hunger
 yah bhi donon sahan karne main sakasham the, magar bacchee kii bhukh-pyaas sahan karnaa mushkil tha
 Thus, they again started walking on the road
 us agnipath ko paar karte hue ve donon shaam se pehle ek basti main pahunche
 Mahendra had a strong hope that after reaching the colony, he would be able to give cold water in the mouth of the wife and the girl, two lives would also be destined for the protection of life
 lekin kahaan ? basti main to ek bhi insaan najar nahin aa rahaa tha
 There was silence in big houses, all the people had fled from there
 mahendra ne idhar-udhar dekhne ke baad bacchee ko ek makaan main le jaakar lita diya
 He came out and started calling loudly
 magar unhen kahin se koi uttar nahin mila
 He said to Kalyani, "listen, you just dare and sit here alone
" yahaan agar gaay hui to shrikrishna kii dayaa se main doodh laa rahaa hum
 Saying this, he picked up a mud pit and came out of the house
 vahaan kai kalsiyaan padi thim
 The vicious thieves of Delhi are taking not only the general public but also the policemen as their victims
 taaja maamla bindapur ilaake kaa he, jahaan choron ne ek pulicekarmi kii sarvice revolver or purse par haath saaf kar diya
 The incident occurred while the policeman was sleeping in the post
 dakshini pashchimi dilli ke bindapur ilaake main choron ne police ko sidhe taur par chunauti de daali or police chaowkee main ghuskar ek eesai kii sarvisarivolveror purse chori kar liya
 After committing the crime, the thieves escaped very comfortably
 police chaowkee main chori kii ghatana saamne aane par police mahakme main khalabali much gai
 The name of ASI who became a victim of thieves is Hoshiar Singh
 uske bayaan ke aadhaar par bindapur thana police ne maamla darj kar liya he

 During this night, i received a call from the police station that someone had been shot in Uttam Nagar
 kol milte hi eesai hoshiyaar singh ghatana sthal par gaye or jaanch karne ke baad waapas aa gaye
 His duty was again at Chhat Ghat at four in the morning
 aise main subah kii dyati ko dekhte hue eesai hoshiyaar singh paali factory sthit police chaowkee main aaraam karne chale gaye
 When his eyes opened in the morning, he saw that his service revolver, five live cartridges and purse were missing from there
 purse main unka ai card, kuch rupee, atm card or anya saamaan bhi tha
 He immediately reported this to the police control room
 police chaowkee main chori kii vaardaat se police mahakme main hadakamp much gaya
 Based on the statement of the victim ASI, a case has been registered at Bindapur police station
 ab police maamle kii jaanch padtaal kar rahi he
 So far, there is no clue of the thieves
 vishnu puraana main kaha gaya he ki shraddha-bhakthi se kiye gaye shraadh se pitaron ke saath hi devgan or anya samast bhoot praani sabhi trupt hote hai
 Therefore some things have special importance in Shraddha and some have prohibition
 aaie jaane, aisi hi mahatvapurn baaten jinka shraadh ke samay dhyaan rakhana bahut jaruri hota he

 Kush and black sesame are believed to originate from the body of Lord Vishnu and silver is believed to originate from the eyes of Lord Shiva
 3
 The letters of Mahua and Palash are considered extremely sacred
 4
 The use of cow's milk and Ganges water increases the results of the cold

 ab tak aisa sirf bharat main hi hota rahaa
 In any country of the world, it is not the case that a judge appoints a judge
 kareeb bees saal tak chalaa ye silsilaa ab yahaan bhi khatm ho gaya
 The Appointment of Supreme Court and High Court judges will be replaced by the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC)
 niyukti ayog kaa swaruparashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog kaa adhyaksh bharat kaa mukhya nyaayadhish hoga
 Its members will be the two senior most judges of the High Court, the Minister of Law and Justice and two enlightened persons (nominated by the Prime Minister, Chief Justice, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha or Leader of the largest opposition party)
 is tarah niyukti ayog main kul 6 sadsy honge
 Enlightened persons will be appointed in the Commission for 3 years only while the remaining members will remain ex-officio members till their respective tenures
 do prabud vyaktiyon main se ek pad essi, asti, obisi, minurity yaa mahila varg ke liye arakshit hoga
 Enlightened people can be nominated only once
 31 disambar ko collegium system ko khatm kar uski jagah rashtriya nyaayik niyukti ayog ke gathan sambandhi samvidhan sanshodhan bill ko raashtrapati ne manjuuri de di thi - or ab 13 april ko notification jari kiya gaya
 What was the collegium system The forum determining the appointment and transfer of judges of the Supreme Court and High Court, which was the result of three judgments of the judiciary
 inhen 'thri jajej cases' ke naam se janaa jaataa rahaa
 The 'first Judges Case' dates back to 1981, in which the Supreme Court ruled that on the basis of sound reasoning or reason, the President can bypass the recommendation of the Chief Justice
 is faisle ne nyaayapalika main niyuktiyon ko lekar karypalika ko shaktishaalee bana diya
 This condition remained intact for 12 years
 uske baad 1993 ke 'second jajej cese' main supreme court kii nau jajon kii samvidhan peeth ne bahumat se yah vyavastha di ki bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish se paraamarsh ke praavdhaan kaa arth unki manjuuri lenaa he
 It was also said in the judgment that these appointments will be made by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and a collegium of two senior most judges
 magar 1998 main 'third jajej cese' main isamen ek badlaav kiya gaya ki supreme court ke nyaayadhish kii niyukti main collegium main mukhya nyaayadhish ke alaava chaar varishthatam jaj sadsy honge, jabaki ucch nyaayalay ke jaj kii niyukti main pehle kii tarah do hi varishthatam jaj honge
 The recommendation of the collegium was sent to the Prime Minister and the President
 isi tarah hai court ke liye sambandhit ucch nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish collegium se salaah mashvire ke baad wo prastaav rajya sarkaar ko bhejte rahe
 Then this proposal would reach the Prime Minister and the President through the Chief Justice of the country - and finally the relevant appointment was made after the President's approval
 duusare deshon main niyukti ke tarichemisaal ke taur par dekhen to britain main nyaayik niyukti ayog he
 The process of selection of judges is entirely in the hands of this commission, which sends recommendations of names to the Lord Chancellor
 australia main niyuktiyon kii sifarish mahadhivaktaa karata he jisaki salaahkaar samiti naamon kii jaanch karti he
 The Advocate General then sends a recommendation to the Governor General
 jahaan tak america kii baat he to vahaan nyaayadhish ko niyukt to raashtrapati hi karata he, par use puri janata or press ke bich seenet kii nyaay palika samiti kii kadi screening se guzarana padataa he
 During this time, it is trying to know what is the background of the candidate on the country's problems and all the issues, what is his background? The candidate has to answer many such questions
 tab kahin jaakar niyukti hoti he
 The Constitution Bench of the Court is going to hear it from April 15 after the National Judicial Appointments Commission has been challenged in the Supreme Court

 Rajghat Gandhi Smriti and the central government are not paying attention to its maintenance

 In such a case, the petition filed on the condition of Rajghat should be canceled
 jab samadhi par koi samasya nahin he to is yachika par sunwaayee karne kaa koi auchity nahin he
 It is against the court process

 The trial court granted Rai bail after two days

 Here the opposition has said that it does not suit a minister to send a common man to jail instead of ignoring his displeasure

 "it's disappointing for us," Pollock said after the match against Yorkshire was canceled due to rain
 lines ne do match jite hai or jis tarah se kaarykram banaaya gaya he, unhen hamase pehle khelnaa he, jiskaa matlab he ki semifinal ke liye kwalifai karnaa ab hamaare haath main nahin he
 He said, this is a little disappointing
 yadi ve yah match jeet jate hai, to unki yah teesri jeet hogi, jabaki sidney sixrs pehle hi teen match jeet chuki he
 So even if we win our remaining two matches, we will still have only 10 points
 hamen yah match jeetna tha, lekin aap mausam par niyantran nahin rakh sakate
 Unfortunately we did not win the first match
 tippaniyan Pollock refused to believe that his bowling was largely dependent on the fast bowling pair of Mitchell Johnson and Lasith Malinga
 unhone kaha, dhaval kulkarni ne chennai superkings ke khilaaf ipel main jo aakhri match khelaa tha, usamen vastav main acchhee gendbaaji kii thi or isliye usase sambhaavnaaen thim
 The former South African captain also refused to believe that the IPL teams were struggling in the Champions League
 unhone kaha, dilli dairedevills ne jo ek match khelaa he, usamen usne jeet darj kii
 Chennai Superkings did not play as expected
 hamane keval ek match ganvaaya he
 If you look at KKR, it has been very successful in Kolkata, where the wicket suited its bowling attack, but the wicket here is not like that
 polock ne yarkshar ke khilaaf match barish ke kaaran radd hone ke baad kaha, yah hamaare liye niraashajanak he
 The Lions have won two matches and the way the program is designed they have to play before us, which means that we are no longer in the hands of qualifying for the semi-finals
 unhone kaha, yah thodaa niraashajanak he
 If they win this match, it will be their third win, while the Sydney Sixers have already won three matches
 aise main yadi ham apane baaki do maichon main jeet bhi darj karte hai, tab bhi hamaare keval 10 ank hi honge
 We were supposed to win this match, but you cannot control the weather
 durbhaagya se ham pehla match nahin jeet paae the
 The comments polock ne yah maanane se inkaar kar diya ki unki gendbaaji bahut had tak mishael johnson or lasith malinga kii tej gendbaaji kii jodi par nirbhar he
 He said, Dhawal Kulkarni bowled really well in the last match he played in the IPL against Chennai Superkings and so there were chances from him
 is purv dakshin africa captain ne yah baat maanane se bhi inkaar kar diya ki ipel timen champions lig main sangharsh kar rahi hai
 He said, in a match played by Delhi Daredevils, he won
 chennai superkings ne vaisaa khel nahin dikhaaya, jaisi ki usase ummid thi
 We have lost only one match
 yadi aap keker ko dekho, to vah kolkata main kaaphi safal rahi he, jahaan kaa wicket uske gendbaaji akraman ke anukool he, lekin yahaan kaa wicket aisa nahin he

 ) Amid reports that the BSP and the SP were not given a place in the alliance in Uttar Pradesh, senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid on Sunday said that if his party was not included in the alliance, the anti-bjp front at the national level would be weak and This can lead to a situation of "disappearing as soon as it is born"
 khurshid ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main mahagathbandhan bananaa sabhi vipakshi dalon ke liye sabase pechida kavayad hogi
 But to present a big challenge in front of the BJP, it is necessary for the Congress, BSP, SP and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) to join hands
 pitiai-bhashaa ko diye saakshaatkaar main uttar pradesh congress ke purv pramukh ne kaha ki rajya main asthirataa jaise halaat hai or party pramukh rahul gandhi 2019 ke aam chunaav main gathbandhan ke liye khule dil-dimag ke saath ashaavadi najariya rakhe hue hai
 When asked about the news that the SP and BSP can keep the Congress out of the alliance in Uttar Pradesh, he said, "I understand that it is just a matter of showing a little attitude but i cannot say for sure
" 
 i have no reason to believe it to be true or false but it would be short-sighted if the Congress is excluded from the coalition in Uttar Pradesh as it can have an impact on a larger coalition at the national level
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘yadi uttar pradesh rashtriya str ke vyapak mahagathbandhan main yogadan nahin karata he to rashtriya str par gathbandhan kamjor hoga or yah paidaa hote hi mit jane jaisi sthiti ho sakati he
 "the former Union Minister said," We all have to make some compromises somewhere and just taking or giving will not matter

 If it did not, it would be a historical loss
 "khurshid kaa yah bayaan khabaron main kiye gaye un daavon ke bich aayaa he jisamen kaha gaya he ki basapa or sapa congress ke bina loksabhaa chunaav ke liye gathbandhan kii taiyaar main juty hai
 The Congress has dismissed these reports as rumors
 basapa ne bhi in daavon ko khaarij kiya he
 Asked what the Congress hopes in Uttar Pradesh after the recent victories in the Hindi belt states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan
 khurshid ne kaha ki uttar pradesh kii sthiti alag he kyonki yahaan party lambey samay se satta se dur he
 After victory in three states, Rahul Gandhi is being seen as a serious opponent in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 is par khurshid ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ne aage badhkar netritv sambhala he jiskaa nateeja sabhi ke saamne he
 Khurshid said that the victory in the state elections has given the message of never giving up

 Naturally, all of them were angry with Kabir Das

 saavarkar to ise khuleam kehete hai: 'hinduij' hindutv kaa ek vyutpann maatr, ek hissaa, ek tukdaa hi he
 "savarkar was the first and probably the only Hindutva thinker who took the trouble to define Hinduism and in 1928 issued a booklet titled" Hindutva: Who is Hindu? "and explained its components and orientation
 (is patr ko sabase pehle 1923 main 'ek maratha' chhadmanaam se hindutv ke liye aadharbhoot tathy ke rup main prakashit kiya gaya
 Savarkar was familiar with the richness and complexity of the Hindu tradition — every Hindutva thinker values his argument — but he considered this prosperity to be a liability rather than an asset
 saavarkar iske liye baichaiyn the ki hindutv ke samrudh saanche ko ekangi paribhaasha ke tahat laayaa jaae
 Being completely inspired by contemporary political concerns, he was insensitive to the historically developed content and structure of Hindutva
 ve likhte hai: hindutv vaisaa nahin he, jaisaa ki aspasht tareeke se hinduism shabd se sanket miltaa he
 Apart from this, 'ism' generally means any principle or code which depends to some extent on a spiritual principle or system
 lekin jab ham hindutv ke anivaary mahatv ko paribhaashit karne kii koshish karte hai, to praathmik rup se yaa mukhyatah hamaara matlab kisi khaas ishwariya dharmatantra siddhant yaa panth se nahin hota
 If there was no linguistic bottleneck, then the word 'hinduness would have been a better choice' (page 4, Hindutva: Who is) parallel to Hinduism and closer to Hindutva

 Savarkar's definition may resolve the confusion as to why it is appropriate to eat beef in Goa and Meghalaya, while the situation in the Hindi belt is that it is reasonable to make you a victim of mob violence only on the suspicion that you have beef in your fridge

 goraksha koi punit bhaavana nahin he, aisa lagata he ki yah 'saanskrithik rashtrawaad' ke ek nishchit brond kaa rajnatik phayda uthaane kii baat he
 Savarkar's Hindutva is not as much related to intellectual persuasion as it is to inciting passion
 unki soch kisi tarah se muslim or isaayiyon ko raashtra ke daayre se baahar rakhane kii thi, isliye ve 'punya bhoomi' ke vichaar ko deshbhakti kii asal katautee ke rup main saamne lekar aae
 They ask: 'who is a Hindu?' And the essence of his answer is in a 'folk of Sanskrit, in which the sanctity of ancient spiritual knowledge is resorted to
 yah 'lok kahata he' 'jo bhi sindhu (nadi) se sindhu (mahaasaagar) tak faili is bharat bhoomi ko apni mathrubhumi, pithrubhumi or pavitra bhoomi maanata he, vah hindu he

 iske liye party ne kaaryakartaaon ko sanghathanaatmak kaaryakramon main vyast rakhane kii yojana banaai he (dekhen box)
 Short term and long term expanders are designed for this
 alpakaalik vistaarak ve 20,000 kaaryakarta hai jo pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay janmashti varsh ke kaaryakramon main shirkat karenge
 State General Secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak says, "these 20,000 expansors will go to more than 13,000 sectors of all the districts of the state and hold meetings
" inamen se 16,000 vistaarak booth samitiyon kii baithak kar logon ko bhaajapa se jodgaye kaa kaam karenge
 "amending the program, National President Amit Shah has suggested that all 16,000 expansors migrate to at least five booths

 Successfully fulfilling the responsibility of election assistants in the assembly elections have been made long-term expanders
 in 137 vistaarakon ke liye party ne saal bhar ke kaarykram tay kiye hai
 State bjp's organization minister Sunil Bansal says, "out of these 116 extensionists will go to all 75 districts and complete the plan of more than two dozen programs
 " dirghakaalik vistaarakon ko abhi ek varsh kaa kaarykram saunpa gaya he lekin iske baad bhi loksabhaa chunaav tak inaki sevaayen lee jaaengi
 "it is possible to hand over the responsibility of these long-term expansors to the organization minister in the district in a way to collect feedback about the possible candidates for the Lok Sabha elections," a state official says
 "nikaay chunaavon kii chunautinagar nigam, nagar palika parishad or nagar panchayaton ke chunaav is lihaaj se bhaajapa kii pariksha lenge kyonki varsh 2000 ke baad yah pehla mauka he jab pradesh main sattarudh dal ke rup main bhaajapa chunaavon main hissaa legi

 Ajit Kumar, a professor at Kashi Hindu University, says, "the municipal elections this time will not be easy for the BJP
 pichhali baar party ko kisi bhi nagar nigam main bahumat nahin mil paaya tha
 The total number of BJP members was less than half of the total number of members of the respective municipal corporation house

 "the elections for cooperative institutions starting in September this year will also test the support base of the BJP
 abhi tak in sansthaaon main sapa kaa varchasv he or ise todgaye ke liye party ko ek kargar vyuh rachana kerani padegi
 BJP state minister and cooperative in-charge Vidyasagar Sonkar says, "A five-member team has been formed at the regional level for the election of cooperatives

 "state BJP President and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya claimed in his presidential speech at the working committee meeting in Fokalskhanu on lost seats," BJP will win all 80 seats in the Lok Sabha elections to be held after two years
 " pichley loksabhaa chunaav main sahyogiyon ke saath 73 siten jeetne vaali party ke adhyaksh kaa daawa bhale hi atishyoktipurna ho lekin vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ne ek sanket to diya hi he
 This is the first time since independence that the BJP has won the victory flag in Rae Bareli and Amethi, which are considered to be Congress strongholds
 donon jilon kii kul 10 main se 6 vidhansabha siton par bhaajapa ne kabja jamaaya he
 Keeping this success in mind, the BJP has focused on 7 Lok Sabha seats that the party had to face despite the Modi wave in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 The best level of the day in rupee terms 54

 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee meanwhile said that the market is setting the price of the rupee against the dollar, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will intervene only when needed
 ullekhneey he ki somvaar ko rupaya tab tak ke sabase nimna str 55
 Closed at 03, and after that the Reserve Bank had set a limit of $ 100 million on the 'position limit' for futures contracts of banks, due to which the domestic currency was 17 paise against the dollar on Tuesday in the interbank foreign exchange market

 The rupee strengthened by five paise to 54 against the dollar on Friday after setting a new low of three times in the inter-bank foreign exchange market last week

 According to traders, the rupee was significantly affected on Monday, mainly due to increase in dollar demand from importers, and dollar purchases related to oil and defense, and then reached a new low

 Facebook has leaked data
 ise lekar us bharat main bahes ho rahi he jo bina soche samajhe line main lagakar aadhaar card banavaa rahaa he
 Where people neither understand the meaning of privacy nor the game of data robbery
 aadhaar number kaa data paanch foot chaudee or 13 feet oonchi diwaar ke bich surakshit he
 If the government making such a claim has such strong security arrangements, it can not distinguish it, can it tell what cases it has caught stealing the personal information of the people
 duniya bhar main google, fasebuk par data chori ke maamle darj ho rahe hai
 The lawsuits are ongoing
 bharat sarkaar kya bataa sakati he ki kya usne google, fasebuk ke khilaaf aisa ek bhi maamla pakadaa he
 Should we accept this and why believe that Facebook and Google in India would not have made a mess
 yah sawaal isliye kiya kyonki buudhvaar ko iti mantri kaaphi josh main bol rahe the
 He said that Mr
 Mark Zuckerberg, take note of the response of the IT Minister of India, we welcome Facebook in India, but it will not be tolerated if Indians' data is stolen due to connivance with the Facebook system
 hamaare iti act kaaphi sakht hai
 We can use it, you can also call India
 hamaare paas kaaphi majboot dhaancha he
 But today i want to hear my warning across the Atlantic to remote California
 jis tevar se angrezi main kaha gaya he wo tevar anuwaad main to nahin jhalkata he magar phir bhi mantri ji 'are o sambha tip' bayaan dene se acha hota ki bataa dete ki bharat ne google or fasebuk ke khilaaf kabhi koi mukadmaa kiya he, chori pakadi he jaise european union ne june 2017 main google ke khilaaf 2
 4 billion Euros was fined, because Google was dominating in wrong ways
 net neutrality ke vakt bharat sarkaar ne zarur fasebuk ko raste par laa diya tha kyonki us vakt fasebuk yahaan ke akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar sarkaar ke khilaaf hi logon ko uksaane laga tha
 We have also forgotten this incident
 yah maamla bhi logon ne pehle uthaaya, khub bahes hui tab jaakar sarkaar isamen ai
 The debate related to Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, is very serious
 ise dhyaan se samajha janaa chahie
 There is a law in India, but do we understand you about it? kal jab koi aadhaar number ke sahare chunavi khel kar jaae, tab aap or ham kaise samajhenge ki in jaankariyon ke zarie janamat ko palat diya gaya
 How can we understand that what happened was wrong, we were responsible for it, we had given information and after that how it will be proved
 kya chunaav ayog aisi paristhitiyon ke liye taiyaar he
 In every election in a country like India, some kind of sex starts running on TV channels, in that country our leaders are giving speeches as privacy experts
 janata ko aashwast kar rahe hai ki aapkaa data yani aapaki jaankaree surakshit he
 Go to any cyber cell in your city
 uski haalat dekh lijie phir pataa chalegaa ki bharat ne kya intazaam kiye hai
 There is a debate all over the world that somewhere outside the country, the gang of companies together do not change the result of the election from our data
 pichley saal sitambar main is maamle ko lekar supreme court main bahes hui thi
 At that time, in September 2017, the government had asked 21 companies making smart phones that how secure is the data in your mobile phone
 whats ap ne supreme court se kaha tha ki vah kisi bhi third party ko apana data nahin degaa
 In this, the government told the Supreme Court that it has formed a committee to protect the data
 23 janvari 2018 ko centre ne supreme court ko kaha he ki ritair justise bean shrikrishna kii adhyakshata main jo cameti banaai gai he wo bill march tak taiyaar ho jayega
 That is, India is far behind
 duniya kii sarkarein pehle se hi jag chuki hai
 During the presidential elections in the United States, Italy, France and Germany, there was discussion that Russia had the power to change their elections
 technolji or data ke zarie vah chunaav ko prabhavit kar rahaa he
 Lies and hatred are loudly propagated, which in turn results in change
 khaskar european union ko laga ki rus har chunaav main hastkshep kar europea union kii ekta ko prabhavit kar rahaa he
 The European Union is breaking up
 khaskar britain ke alag hone ko bhi data ke istamaal se joda ja rahaa he
 Think that elections are going on in India and from our data, America is deciding which party should get a majority so that after forming its government, it can formulate policies in the desired manner
 kya aap aisa chahenge
 28 countries of the European Union have enacted data protection laws to protect their elections
 aap jaanate hai ki america kii kai technolji company fasebuk google kaa mukhyalay ireland main he, kyonki ireland main baaki deshon kaa kanoon lagu nahin hota tha
 The European Union has changed this system through legislation
 ab in companiyon par european union ke banaae niyam lagu hone the
 Germany has also made its laws very strict
 kuch saal pehle belgium ne fasebuk ko privesi data kanoon ke ulanghan ke maamle main adaalat main ghaseet liya tha
 a committee has been formed in the Parliament of Britain on how social media is impacting elections, there is Information Commissioner's Office which investigates such cases
 bharat daawa to karata he ki uske kanoon sakht hai magar vah kaaphi peeche chal rahaa he
 If there is tension in a district, direct internet has to be stopped
 jin tatwon kii vajah se band karnaa padataa he unhen kabhi in sakht kanoonon ke dam par sazaa mili he yaa nahin, iskaa record bahut karaab hi hoga
 This was debated in the Supreme Court in September last year
 tab whats ap ne kaha tha ki vah yuzar kaa data kisi tisare ko nahin detaa he
 The government had asked 21 companies making smart phones that how secure the data is with you
 ritair justise bean shrikrishna kii adhyakshata main data protection par cameti banaai
 In the month of January, the government has told the Supreme Court that after its report, the data protection bill will be ready by March
 yani abhi ham taiyaar nahin he, taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Would you like Russia or America to take such data from you and run such an election campaign, in the guise of which we all come and we choose a government which will later cut our own pockets
 jeena mushkil kar de
 It is said that the election is being influenced by the data
 phir bhi bahut se log nahin samajhate hai ki chunaav ko kaise prabhavit kiya ja saktaa he
 We asked the same question to Rakesh, who runs an organization called Ballotbox India
 nai sanstha he, ham zyaada nahin jaanate
 Now come to the current controversy
 aap jaanate hai ki jab se trump jite hai america main jaanch ho rahi he ki kya is chunaav main rus ne dakhal diya tha, matlab kya rus ne apni taraf se koi propeganda chalaaya jiskaa laabh trump ko mila
 Suppose ten companies in India consider a leader as their Bunty, to win Bunty and later Bunty will work on our whistle
 banty jeet gaya, aapke saamne sher banegaa magar companiyon ke saamne chup rahegaa
 That is why research is going on all over the world that democracy cannot be eliminated with the use of data
 abhi yah samajha hi ja rahaa he ki kya galat he, kya sahi he
 But in India, Congress and BJP are blaming each other as if they have understood everything
 disambar 2016 main america kii dizine kii professor 'carole Cadwalladr' ne apane research ke dauraan paaya ki amareeki chunaav main cambrinz analita kii bhoomika he or uskaa sambandh european union se britain ko alag karne ke abhiyaan main bhi he
 Cambridge Analytica received data from more than 50 million US citizens from a researcher
 is research ne ek ap banaaya tha, jisase log apni sahmati se jude the
 As many apps come on Facebook, you click and start connecting and press the button of i Agri
 yaa to aap samaj nahin pate yaa laaparvaah ho jate hai, udhar vah ap aapaki sari jaankaree lekar kisi teesri party ko bech dete hai
 That company uses that data to change the air of politics or to sell a product
 yahi hua he is vivaad main
 Now for five days, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook admitted that a big mistake has been made
 aage se nahin ho iske liye vyavastha kii jaaegi
 People involved with data and privacy say that this is not enough
 zukarbarg yah bataayen ki 2014 se pehle jin jin ap ne data churaayaa he, uskaa ve kya kar rahe hai isaki jaanch sambhav nahin he, kyonki ap kii sankhya to kai hazaar main he
 We and you use Facebook
 ek bharosa hota he magar usee se jaankaree kisi or ke paas chali jaae to phir bharosa tuutata he
 And if that information was used by a company sitting in Russia or America to influence your political opinion, then it means that democracy can be in danger at any time due to technology
 aap dekhie ki kai jagahon par aisa ho rahaa he
 Once coming to power, it is not losing
 rus ke raashtrapati putin ko dekhie, china ke raashtrapati to aaajeevan hi gaddi par baith gaye hai
 No one in India should have such a dream, so the public should be alert about this subject
 yah masalaa fasebuk kaa he magar aapako sochna chahie ki kahin aadhaar number ke kaaran yah khatra kareeb to nahin he
 America, Italy, France and Germany do not have an Aadhaar number, India has an Aadhaar number
 kahin aisa na ho ki sabsidi bachaane ke naam par loktantr hi haath se chalaa jaae
 When the matter arose in Britain, the Election Commission immediately began to investigate, Congress BJP in India are making allegations, openly saying that you did it and you did it
 magar chunaav ayog kaa pataa nahin
 What address does not come under its jurisdiction
 bharat main jab bhi iviem ke hack kiye jane kaa sawaal uthta he to ham mazaaq udaate hai
 The biggest argument is how can one doubt the Election Commission
 hamen nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki isi chunaav ayog ke rahete dashakon booth luute jate rahe
 Not the Commission, but one person made the Commission trustworthy
 kya aapako yah lagata he ki america, france, italy, germany ke chunaav ayog main logon kaa vishwaas hi nahin hai
 Still there is a debate whether technology or the process of election is being affected
 germany main aam chunaav ke pehle vahaan khub charchaa hui
 The head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution had said that it is absolutely possible to hack the election and influence it from outside
 ek report pard rahaa tha jisamen kaha gaya ki germany main ek counting software he jise pc-wahl he, ise hack kiya ja saktaa he
 The result can be changed by manipulating its data
 un deshon main aise sawaalon ko gambhirtha se liya jaataa he, hamaare yahaan aise saare sawaal kaa yahi jawaab he ki ham chunaav ayog par shaq kaise kar sakate hai
 Just ask what is the system to prevent such a possibility with the Election Commission
 balatbox india ke rakesh ne haal hi main ek lanbaa patr likhakar in khataron ke prati aagaah kiya tha magar vahi jawaab mila, balki ab to jawaab na milanaa hi jawaab samajha jane laga he
 The comments yah jatil masalaa he magar samajhnaa aasaan he
 What will happen is that you consent to give your information to an app, and use it for some other purpose
 jaisaa ki crambinge analitica ke maamle main hua
 The people themselves gave information to Research Cogan of Cambridge University
 usne zarur cambridge analitica ko bech diya
 Do not get into the game of Congress BJP so quickly
 mehnat se hasil loktantr kii chintaa kiijie
 Every party in India is now using data
 isiilie har chunaav main aap dekhenge ki jhooth kaa bolbalaa ho gaya he
 Every lie is greater than another lie
 bharat main cambridge enelitica company ke sutara ab jediu ke netaa kasee tyaagi ke bete amrish tyaagi se jud rahe hai
 Alexander Nix, founder of the Cambridge Analytica Company, built the Strategic Communication Laboratory in India
 nix do logo ke saath milakar dekh rahe the jinamein se ek hai avanish raay or duusare hai amrish tyaagi, kasee tyaagi ke ladke
 Avnish Rai spoke to Srinivasan Jain and explained how the Knicks were interested in India's election
 shuruyaat main nix ne kaha tha ki wo congress ke liye data collection kii baat karne aae hai magar baad main pachaa chalaa ki ve congress ko haraane ke liye kaam kar rahe the
 Avnish is also telling how the data was collected by creating an app and there was a dispute over who will be the host of that data
 avaneesh ab is maamle main visal blor ban gaye he
 Listen to their interview, your senses will fly away
 nix kaa kahana tha ki uskaa matlab sirf dhandha karne se he wo paisa kamaane se aayaa tha
 This question was raised because on Wednesday, the IT minister was speaking in great enthusiasm
 unhone kaha ki mistar mark zukarbarg, aap bharat ke iti mantri kii pratikriya ko note kar len, ham bharat main fasebuk kaa swaagat karte hai, lekin agar fasebuk system kii mileebhagat se bharatiyon kaa data chori hua he to yah bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 Our IT Act is very strict
 ham uskaa istamaal kar sakate hai, aapako bhi bharat bula sakate hai
 We have a very strong structure
 lekin aaj main apni chetavanee atlantic paar sudur california tak suna dena chahta hum
 The text that has been said in English does not reflect in the translation, but still the Minister would have been better to give the statement 'are o Sambha Type', telling that India has ever made a case against Google and Facebook, theft
 Caught like the European Union in June 2017 against Google 2
 4 billian euro kaa jurmaana kiya tha, kyonki google galat tareekon se apana varchasv bana rahaa tha
 At the time of Net Neutrality, the Government of India had definitely brought Facebook on its way because at that time Facebook had started provoking people against the government by advertising in newspapers here
 is ghatana ko bhi ham bhul chuke hai
 People also raised this matter first, there was a lot of debate then the government came into it
 fasebuk, crambridge analitica se judi bahes bahut gambhir he
 This should be understood carefully
 bharat main kanoon to he, lekin kya use lekar hamaari aapaki samaj he
 Tomorrow, when someone goes to the election game with the help of Aadhaar number, then how will you and we understand that public opinion was reversed through these information
 ham kaise samajhenge ki jo hua wo galat tha, uske liye hameen zimmedaar the, hamane hi jaankaree de di thi or uske baad yah sabit kaise hoga
 Is the Election Commission ready for such situations
 bharat jaise desh main har chunaav main kisi na kisi kii sex tivi channelon par chalane lagati he, us desh main hamaare netaa privesi ke export banakar bhaashan de rahe hai
 Assuring the public that your data means your information is safe
 aap apane shahar ke kisi bhi sibar cell main chale jaaiye
 Look at his condition and then you will know what arrangements India has made
 puri duniya main bahes chal rahi he ki kahin baahar kaa desh, companiyon kaa giroh milakar hamaare aapke data se chunaav kaa nateeja hi na badal de
 The matter was debated in the Supreme Court in September last year
 us vakt sarkaar ne sitambar 2017 main smart phone banane vaali 21 companiyon se poocha tha ki aapke mobile phone main data kitna surakshit he
 Whats Up had told the Supreme Court that it would not give its data to any third party
 isi main sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya ki usne data kii suraksha ke liye ek cameti banaai he
 On 23 January 2018, the Center has told the Supreme Court that the committee constituted under the chairmanship of Retired Justice BN Srikrishna, the bill will be ready by March
 yani bharat abhi kaaphi peeche he
 The governments of the world have already awakened
 america main hue raashtrapati chunaav, italy, france or germany ke chunaavon ke dauraan hi vahaan charchaa chal padi ki rus unke chunaavon ko badalane kii takat rakhata he
 Through technology and data, he is influencing elections
 jhooth or nafrat kii baton kaa jor-shor se prachaar hota he, jiske prabhaav main nattejey badal jate hai
 Especially the European Union felt that Russia was affecting the unity of the European Union by interfering in every election
 european union ko tod rahaa he
 Particularly the separation of Britain is also being linked to the use of data
 sochie bharat main chunaav ho rahe hai or hamaare data se america tay kar rahaa ho ki koun se dal ko bahumat milanaa chahie taaki uski sarkaar banane ke baad wo manachaahe dhang se nitiyaan bana sake
 Would you like to european union ke 28 deshon ne apane yahaan hone vaale chunaavon ko bachaane ke liye data protection kanoon banaaya he
 You know that Facebook technology is headquartered in Ireland by many technology company of USA, because the law of other countries was not applicable in Ireland
 european union ne kanoon ke zarie is vyavastha ko badal diya he
 Now the rules made by the European Union were to apply to these companies
 germany ne bhi apane kanoon kaaphi sakht kiye hai
 a few years ago, Belgium dragged Facebook to court in violation of privacy data law
 britain kii sansad main ek cameti bani he ki soshal media kaa chunaavon par kya prabhaav pad rahaa he, vahaan information kamishnar offis he jo aise maamalon kii jaanch karata he
 India claims that its laws are strict but it is lagging far behind
 kisi zile main tanaav ho jaae to sidhaa internet band karnaa padataa he
 Elements that have to be shut down have ever been punished on the basis of these strict laws or not, its record will be very poor
 pichley saal sitambar main supreme court main is par bahes hui thi
 Whats up then said that it does not give user data to any third
 sarkaar ne smart phone banane vaali 21 companio se poocha tha ki aapke yahaan data kitna surakshit he
 Committee on Data Protection headed by Retired Justice BN Srikrishna
 abhi janvari maheene main sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya he ki isaki report ke baad march tak data protection kaa bill taiyaar ho jayega
 That is, we are not ready yet, we are preparing
 kya aap chahenge ki rus yaa america hamaara aapkaa data lekar aisa chunavi campan chalaa de jiske jhaanse main ham sab aa jaaen or ham aisi sarkaar chun len jo baad main hamaari hi jeb kaatane lage
 Make it difficult to live isi ko kehete hai ki data se chunaav prabhavit kiya ja rahaa he
 Yet many people do not understand how elections can be affected
 hamane yahi sawaal rakesh se poocha jo belatbox india naam kii sanstha chalaate hai
 We are a new institution, we do not know much
 ab aate hai maujuuda vivaad par
 You know that since Trump won, the United States has been investigating whether Russia interfered in this election, meaning that Russia ran a propaganda on its behalf that benefited Trump
 maan lijie bharat main das companiyaan kisi netaa ko apana banty samajhati hon, ki banty ko jeeta den or baad main banty hamaari siti par kaam karegaa
 Bunty wins, a lion will be there in front of you but will remain silent in front of companies
 isiilie duniya bhar main research chal rahaa he ki kahin data ke istamaal se loktantr hi na samaapt ho jaae
 It is being understood that what is wrong, what is right
 lekin bharat main congress or bijepi is tarah ek duusare par aarope laga rahi hai jaise in donon ne sabakuch samaj liya ho
 In December 2016, Carole Cadwalladr, a US design professor, during her research found Cambrian Analita's role in the US election and her connection to the campaign to separate Britain from the European Union
 cambridge analitica ko 5 karod se adhik amareeki nagarikon kaa data ek research se mila
 This researcher had created an app, which people associated with their consent
 jaise fasebuk par bahut se ap aate hai, aap clic kar judane lag jate hai or ai agri kaa batan dabaa dete hai
 Either you do not understand or become careless, on the other hand, the app takes all your information and sells it to a third party
 vah company us data kaa istemaal raajnneetik kii hawa badalane main karti he yaa kisi product ko bechney main karti he
 This is what happened in this dispute
 ab paanch dinon tak fasebuk ke mark zukarbarg ne mana ki bahut badi galati ho gai he
 Arrangements will be made for this to not happen from now on
 data or privesi se jude log kehete hai ki yah kaaphi nahin he
 It should not be possible to tell Zuckerberg that what the app that stole data before 2014 is doing what they are doing, because the number of apps is in thousands
 ham or aap fasebuk kaa istemaal karte hai
 There is a trust, but if the information gets passed on to someone else, then the trust is broken
 or us jaankaree kaa istemaal aapke raajnneetik mat ko prabhavit karne main rus yaa america main baithi koi company kar le to sidhaa matlab yah hua ki loktantr technolji ke kaaran kabhi bhi khatre main pad saktaa he
 You see that this is happening in many places
 ek baar jo satta main aa rahaa he, wo haar hi nahin rahaa he
 Look at the President of Russia, Putin, the President of China has sat on the throne for a lifetime
 bharat main koi is tarah kaa sapana na dekhe isliye janata ko is vishay ko lekar satark ho janaa chahie
 This is the issue of Facebook, but you should think that due to Aadhaar number, this danger is not close
 america, italy, france or germany main aadhaar number nahin he, bharat main aadhaar number he
 Lest democracy should run out in the name of saving subsidies
 britain main maamla uthaa to vahaan kaa chunaav ayog turant jaanch karne laga, bharat main congress bijepi aarope laga rahe hai, khuleam kah rahe hai ki aapane aisa kiya to aapane aisa kiya
 But the Election Commission does not know
 kya pataa uske adhikaar kshetra main hi yah na aata ho
 Whenever the question of evms is hacked in India, we make fun
 sabase badi daleel he ki chunaav ayog par shaq kaise kar sakate hai
 We should not forget that during this election commission booths were looted for decades
 ayog ne nahin, ek vyakti ne ayog ko bharose laayak banaaya tha
 Do you think that people do not have faith in the Election Commission of America, France, Italy, Germany
 phir bhi vahaan bahes ho rahi he ki technalji se kahin riselt yaa chunaav kii prakriya ko prabhavit to nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 There was a lot of discussion before the general election in Germany 
 vahaan ke fedral offis for di protection of di constitution ke pramukh ne kaha tha ki chunaav ko hack karnaa, baahar se prabhavit karnaa bilkul sambhav he
 Was reading a report that said there is a counting software in Germany which is pc-wahl, it can be hacked
 iske data ko ched kar riselt badla ja saktaa he
 Such questions are taken seriously in those countries, this is the answer to all such questions here, how can we doubt the Election Commission
 yahi puch lijie ki chunaav ayog ke paas aisi sambhaavna ko rokane ke liye system hi kya he
 Rakesh of Balletbox India had recently written a long letter and warned against these dangers, but got the same answer, but now the answer is beginning to be understood
 tippaniyan This is a complex issue but easy to understand
 kya hoga ki aap sahmati se apni jaankaree kisi ap ko de den, or vah uskaa istamaal kisi or kaam ke liye kar le
 As in the case of Crambin Analytica
 logon ne khud hi cambridge uniwarsity ke researchan kogan ko jaankaree di
 He definitely sold it to Cambridge Analytica
 itani jaldi se congress bijepi ke khel main mat padie
 Worry about hard-earned democracy
 bharat main har dal ab data kaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 That is why in every election you will see that lies have been dominated
 har jhooth duusare jhooth se bada hota he
 Sources at Cambridge Analytica Company in India are now joining Amrish Tyagi, son of JDU leader Casey Tyagi
 cambridge enelitica company ke sansthaapak alexander nix ne bharat main stritgic communication leboratory banaai
 Nix was seen together with two people, one of whom is Avnish Rai and the other is Amrish Tyagi, KC Tyagi's boys
 avanish raay ne shrinivasana jain se baat kii or vistaar se bataaya ki kaise nix kii ruchi bharat ke chunaav main thi
 Initially, Nix had said that he had come to talk of data collection for Congress but later came to know that he was working to defeat Congress
 avanish yah bhi bataa rahe hai ki ap bana kar kaise data ikaitha kiya or us data kaa host koun hoga is par vivaad hua
 Avnish has now become a whistle blower in this case
 aap inkaa intervyuu suniye, hosh ud jaaenge
 Nix said that he meant only by doing business, he came from earning money
 jis tevar se angrezi main kaha gaya he wo tevar anuwaad main to nahin jhalkata he magar phir bhi mantri ji 'are o sambha tip' bayaan dene se acha hota ki bataa dete ki bharat ne google or fasebuk ke khilaaf kabhi koi mukadmaa kiya he, chori pakadi he jaise european union ne june 2017 main google ke khilaaf 2
 4 billion Euros was fined, because Google was dominating in wrong ways
 net neutrality ke vakt bharat sarkaar ne zarur fasebuk ko raste par laa diya tha kyonki us vakt fasebuk yahaan ke akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar sarkaar ke khilaaf hi logon ko uksaane laga tha
 We have also forgotten this incident
 yah maamla bhi logon ne pehle uthaaya, khub bahes hui tab jaakar sarkaar isamen ai
 The debate related to Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, is very serious
 ise dhyaan se samajha janaa chahie
 There is a law in India, but do we understand you about it? kal jab koi aadhaar number ke sahare chunavi khel kar jaae, tab aap or ham kaise samajhenge ki in jaankariyon ke zarie janamat ko palat diya gaya
 How can we understand that what happened was wrong, we were responsible for it, we had given information and after that how it will be proved
 kya chunaav ayog aisi paristhitiyon ke liye taiyaar he
 In every election in a country like India, some kind of sex starts running on TV channels, in that country our leaders are giving speeches as privacy experts
 janata ko aashwast kar rahe hai ki aapkaa data yani aapaki jaankaree surakshit he
 Go to any cyber cell in your city
 uski haalat dekh lijie phir pataa chalegaa ki bharat ne kya intazaam kiye hai
 There is a debate all over the world that somewhere outside the country, the gang of companies together do not change the result of the election from our data
 pichley saal sitambar main is maamle ko lekar supreme court main bahes hui thi
 At that time, in September 2017, the government had asked 21 companies making smart phones that how secure is the data in your mobile phone
 whats ap ne supreme court se kaha tha ki vah kisi bhi third party ko apana data nahin degaa
 In this, the government told the Supreme Court that it has formed a committee to protect the data
 23 janvari 2018 ko centre ne supreme court ko kaha he ki ritair justise bean shrikrishna kii adhyakshata main jo cameti banaai gai he wo bill march tak taiyaar ho jayega
 That is, India is far behind
 duniya kii sarkarein pehle se hi jag chuki hai
 During the presidential elections in the United States, Italy, France and Germany, there was discussion that Russia had the power to change their elections
 technolji or data ke zarie vah chunaav ko prabhavit kar rahaa he
 Lies and hatred are loudly propagated, which in turn results in change
 khaskar european union ko laga ki rus har chunaav main hastkshep kar europea union kii ekta ko prabhavit kar rahaa he
 The European Union is breaking up
 khaskar britain ke alag hone ko bhi data ke istamaal se joda ja rahaa he
 Think that elections are going on in India and from our data, America is deciding which party should get a majority so that after forming its government, it can formulate policies in the desired manner
 kya aap aisa chahenge
 28 countries of the European Union have enacted data protection laws to protect their elections
 aap jaanate hai ki america kii kai technolji company fasebuk google kaa mukhyalay ireland main he, kyonki ireland main baaki deshon kaa kanoon lagu nahin hota tha
 The European Union has changed this system through legislation
 ab in companiyon par european union ke banaae niyam lagu hone the
 Germany has also made its laws very strict
 kuch saal pehle belgium ne fasebuk ko privesi data kanoon ke ulanghan ke maamle main adaalat main ghaseet liya tha
 a committee has been formed in the Parliament of Britain on how social media is impacting elections, there is Information Commissioner's Office which investigates such cases
 bharat daawa to karata he ki uske kanoon sakht hai magar vah kaaphi peeche chal rahaa he
 If there is tension in a district, direct internet has to be stopped
 jin tatwon kii vajah se band karnaa padataa he unhen kabhi in sakht kanoonon ke dam par sazaa mili he yaa nahin, iskaa record bahut karaab hi hoga
 This was debated in the Supreme Court in September last year
 tab whats ap ne kaha tha ki vah yuzar kaa data kisi tisare ko nahin detaa he
 The government had asked 21 companies making smart phones that how secure the data is with you
 ritair justise bean shrikrishna kii adhyakshata main data protection par cameti banaai
 In the month of January, the government has told the Supreme Court that after its report, the data protection bill will be ready by March
 yani abhi ham taiyaar nahin he, taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Would you like Russia or America to take such data from you and run such an election campaign, in the guise of which we all come and we choose a government which will later cut our own pockets
 jeena mushkil kar de
 It is said that the election is being influenced by the data
 phir bhi bahut se log nahin samajhate hai ki chunaav ko kaise prabhavit kiya ja saktaa he
 We asked the same question to Rakesh, who runs an organization called Ballotbox India
 nai sanstha he, ham zyaada nahin jaanate
 Now come to the current controversy
 aap jaanate hai ki jab se trump jite hai america main jaanch ho rahi he ki kya is chunaav main rus ne dakhal diya tha, matlab kya rus ne apni taraf se koi propeganda chalaaya jiskaa laabh trump ko mila
 Suppose ten companies in India consider a leader as their Bunty, to win Bunty and later Bunty will work on our whistle
 banty jeet gaya, aapke saamne sher banegaa magar companiyon ke saamne chup rahegaa
 That is why research is going on all over the world that democracy cannot be eliminated with the use of data
 abhi yah samajha hi ja rahaa he ki kya galat he, kya sahi he
 But in India, Congress and BJP are blaming each other as if they have understood everything
 disambar 2016 main america kii dizine kii professor 'carole Cadwalladr' ne apane research ke dauraan paaya ki amareeki chunaav main cambrinz analita kii bhoomika he or uskaa sambandh european union se britain ko alag karne ke abhiyaan main bhi he
 Cambridge Analytica received data from more than 50 million US citizens from a researcher
 is research ne ek ap banaaya tha, jisase log apni sahmati se jude the
 As many apps come on Facebook, you click and start connecting and press the button of i Agri
 yaa to aap samaj nahin pate yaa laaparvaah ho jate hai, udhar vah ap aapaki sari jaankaree lekar kisi teesri party ko bech dete hai
 That company uses that data to change the air of politics or to sell a product
 yahi hua he is vivaad main
 Now for five days, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook admitted that a big mistake has been made
 aage se nahin ho iske liye vyavastha kii jaaegi
 People involved with data and privacy say that this is not enough
 zukarbarg yah bataayen ki 2014 se pehle jin jin ap ne data churaayaa he, uskaa ve kya kar rahe hai isaki jaanch sambhav nahin he, kyonki ap kii sankhya to kai hazaar main he
 We and you use Facebook
 ek bharosa hota he magar usee se jaankaree kisi or ke paas chali jaae to phir bharosa tuutata he
 And if that information was used by a company sitting in Russia or America to influence your political opinion, then it means that democracy can be in danger at any time due to technology
 aap dekhie ki kai jagahon par aisa ho rahaa he
 Once coming to power, it is not losing
 rus ke raashtrapati putin ko dekhie, china ke raashtrapati to aaajeevan hi gaddi par baith gaye hai
 No one in India should have such a dream, so the public should be alert about this subject
 yah masalaa fasebuk kaa he magar aapako sochna chahie ki kahin aadhaar number ke kaaran yah khatra kareeb to nahin he
 America, Italy, France and Germany do not have an Aadhaar number, India has an Aadhaar number
 kahin aisa na ho ki sabsidi bachaane ke naam par loktantr hi haath se chalaa jaae
 When the matter arose in Britain, the Election Commission immediately began to investigate, Congress BJP in India are making allegations, openly saying that you did it and you did it
 magar chunaav ayog kaa pataa nahin
 What address does not come under its jurisdiction
 bharat main jab bhi iviem ke hack kiye jane kaa sawaal uthta he to ham mazaaq udaate hai
 The biggest argument is how can one doubt the Election Commission
 hamen nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki isi chunaav ayog ke rahete dashakon booth luute jate rahe
 Not the Commission, but one person made the Commission trustworthy
 kya aapako yah lagata he ki america, france, italy, germany ke chunaav ayog main logon kaa vishwaas hi nahin hai
 Still there is a debate whether technology or the process of election is being affected
 germany main aam chunaav ke pehle vahaan khub charchaa hui
 The head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution had said that it is absolutely possible to hack the election and influence it from outside
 ek report pard rahaa tha jisamen kaha gaya ki germany main ek counting software he jise pc-wahl he, ise hack kiya ja saktaa he
 The result can be changed by manipulating its data
 un deshon main aise sawaalon ko gambhirtha se liya jaataa he, hamaare yahaan aise saare sawaal kaa yahi jawaab he ki ham chunaav ayog par shaq kaise kar sakate hai
 Just ask what is the system to prevent such a possibility with the Election Commission
 balatbox india ke rakesh ne haal hi main ek lanbaa patr likhakar in khataron ke prati aagaah kiya tha magar vahi jawaab mila, balki ab to jawaab na milanaa hi jawaab samajha jane laga he
 The comments yah jatil masalaa he magar samajhnaa aasaan he
 What will happen is that you consent to give your information to an app, and use it for some other purpose
 jaisaa ki crambinge analitica ke maamle main hua
 The people themselves gave information to Research Cogan of Cambridge University
 usne zarur cambridge analitica ko bech diya
 Do not get into the game of Congress BJP so quickly
 mehnat se hasil loktantr kii chintaa kiijie
 Every party in India is now using data
 isiilie har chunaav main aap dekhenge ki jhooth kaa bolbalaa ho gaya he
 Every lie is greater than another lie

 shuruyaat main nix ne kaha tha ki wo congress ke liye data collection kii baat karne aae hai magar baad main pachaa chalaa ki ve congress ko haraane ke liye kaam kar rahe the
 Avnish is also telling how the data was collected by creating an app and there was a dispute over who will be the host of that data
 avaneesh ab is maamle main visal blor ban gaye he
 Listen to their interview, your senses will fly away

 yah masalaa fasebuk kaa he magar aapako sochna chahie ki kahin aadhaar number ke kaaran yah khatra kareeb to nahin he
 America, Italy, France and Germany do not have an Aadhaar number, India has an Aadhaar number
 kahin aisa na ho ki sabsidi bachaane ke naam par loktantr hi haath se chalaa jaae
 When the matter arose in Britain, the Election Commission immediately began to investigate, Congress BJP in India are making allegations, openly saying that you did it and you did it
 magar chunaav ayog kaa pataa nahin
 What address does not come under its jurisdiction
 bharat main jab bhi iviem ke hack kiye jane kaa sawaal uthta he to ham mazaaq udaate hai
 The biggest argument is how can one doubt the Election Commission
 hamen nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki isi chunaav ayog ke rahete dashakon booth luute jate rahe
 Not the Commission, but one person made the Commission trustworthy
 kya aapako yah lagata he ki america, france, italy, germany ke chunaav ayog main logon kaa vishwaas hi nahin hai
 Still there is a debate whether technology or the process of election is being affected
 germany main aam chunaav ke pehle vahaan khub charchaa hui
 The head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution had said that it is absolutely possible to hack the election and influence it from outside
 ek report pard rahaa tha jisamen kaha gaya ki germany main ek counting software he jise pc-wahl he, ise hack kiya ja saktaa he
 The result can be changed by manipulating its data
 un deshon main aise sawaalon ko gambhirtha se liya jaataa he, hamaare yahaan aise saare sawaal kaa yahi jawaab he ki ham chunaav ayog par shaq kaise kar sakate hai
 Just ask what is the system to prevent such a possibility with the Election Commission
 balatbox india ke rakesh ne haal hi main ek lanbaa patr likhakar in khataron ke prati aagaah kiya tha magar vahi jawaab mila, balki ab to jawaab na milanaa hi jawaab samajha jane laga he

 Do not get into the game of Congress BJP so quickly
 mehnat se hasil loktantr kii chintaa kiijie
 Every party in India is now using data
 isiilie har chunaav main aap dekhenge ki jhooth kaa bolbalaa ho gaya he
 Every lie is greater than another lie

 Avnish Rai spoke to Srinivasan Jain and explained how the Knicks were interested in India's election
 shuruyaat main nix ne kaha tha ki wo congress ke liye data collection kii baat karne aae hai magar baad main pachaa chalaa ki ve congress ko haraane ke liye kaam kar rahe the
 Avnish is also telling how the data was collected by creating an app and there was a dispute over who will be the host of that data
 avaneesh ab is maamle main visal blor ban gaye he
 Listen to their interview, your senses will fly away
 nix kaa kahana tha ki uskaa matlab sirf dhandha karne se he wo paisa kamaane se aayaa tha
 The European Union has changed this system through legislation
 ab in companiyon par european union ke banaae niyam lagu hone the
 Germany has also made its laws very strict
 kuch saal pehle belgium ne fasebuk ko privesi data kanoon ke ulanghan ke maamle main adaalat main ghaseet liya tha
 a committee has been formed in the Parliament of Britain on how social media is impacting elections, there is Information Commissioner's Office which investigates such cases
 bharat daawa to karata he ki uske kanoon sakht hai magar vah kaaphi peeche chal rahaa he
 If there is tension in a district, direct internet has to be stopped
 jin tatwon kii vajah se band karnaa padataa he unhen kabhi in sakht kanoonon ke dam par sazaa mili he yaa nahin, iskaa record bahut karaab hi hoga
 This was debated in the Supreme Court in September last year
 tab whats ap ne kaha tha ki vah yuzar kaa data kisi tisare ko nahin detaa he
 The government had asked 21 companies making smart phones that how secure the data is with you
 ritair justise bean shrikrishna kii adhyakshata main data protection par cameti banaai
 In the month of January, the government has told the Supreme Court that after its report, the data protection bill will be ready by March
 yani abhi ham taiyaar nahin he, taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Would you like Russia or America to take such data from you and run such an election campaign, in the guise of which we all come and we choose a government which will later cut our own pockets
 jeena mushkil kar de
 It is said that the election is being influenced by the data
 phir bhi bahut se log nahin samajhate hai ki chunaav ko kaise prabhavit kiya ja saktaa he
 We asked the same question to Rakesh, who runs an organization called Ballotbox India
 nai sanstha he, ham zyaada nahin jaanate
 Now come to the current controversy
 aap jaanate hai ki jab se trump jite hai america main jaanch ho rahi he ki kya is chunaav main rus ne dakhal diya tha, matlab kya rus ne apni taraf se koi propeganda chalaaya jiskaa laabh trump ko mila
 Suppose ten companies in India consider a leader as their Bunty, to win Bunty and later Bunty will work on our whistle
 banty jeet gaya, aapke saamne sher banegaa magar companiyon ke saamne chup rahegaa
 That is why research is going on all over the world that democracy cannot be eliminated with the use of data
 abhi yah samajha hi ja rahaa he ki kya galat he, kya sahi he
 But in India, Congress and BJP are blaming each other as if they have understood everything
 disambar 2016 main america kii dizine kii professor 'carole Cadwalladr' ne apane research ke dauraan paaya ki amareeki chunaav main cambrinz analita kii bhoomika he or uskaa sambandh european union se britain ko alag karne ke abhiyaan main bhi he
 Cambridge Analytica received data from more than 50 million US citizens from a researcher
 is research ne ek ap banaaya tha, jisase log apni sahmati se jude the
 As many apps come on Facebook, you click and start connecting and press the button of i Agri
 yaa to aap samaj nahin pate yaa laaparvaah ho jate hai, udhar vah ap aapaki sari jaankaree lekar kisi teesri party ko bech dete hai
 That company uses that data to change the air of politics or to sell a product
 yahi hua he is vivaad main
 Now for five days, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook admitted that a big mistake has been made
 aage se nahin ho iske liye vyavastha kii jaaegi
 People involved with data and privacy say that this is not enough
 zukarbarg yah bataayen ki 2014 se pehle jin jin ap ne data churaayaa he, uskaa ve kya kar rahe hai isaki jaanch sambhav nahin he, kyonki ap kii sankhya to kai hazaar main he
 We and you use Facebook
 ek bharosa hota he magar usee se jaankaree kisi or ke paas chali jaae to phir bharosa tuutata he
 And if that information was used by a company sitting in Russia or America to influence your political opinion, then it means that democracy can be in danger at any time due to technology
 aap dekhie ki kai jagahon par aisa ho rahaa he
 Once coming to power, it is not losing
 rus ke raashtrapati putin ko dekhie, china ke raashtrapati to aaajeevan hi gaddi par baith gaye hai
 No one in India should have such a dream, so the public should be alert about this subject
 yah masalaa fasebuk kaa he magar aapako sochna chahie ki kahin aadhaar number ke kaaran yah khatra kareeb to nahin he
 America, Italy, France and Germany do not have an Aadhaar number, India has an Aadhaar number

 India claims that its laws are strict but it is lagging far behind
 kisi zile main tanaav ho jaae to sidhaa internet band karnaa padataa he
 Elements that have to be shut down have ever been punished on the basis of these strict laws or not, its record will be very poor
 pichley saal sitambar main supreme court main is par bahes hui thi
 Whats up then said that it does not give user data to any third
 sarkaar ne smart phone banane vaali 21 companio se poocha tha ki aapke yahaan data kitna surakshit he
 Committee on Data Protection headed by Retired Justice BN Srikrishna
 abhi janvari maheene main sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya he ki isaki report ke baad march tak data protection kaa bill taiyaar ho jayega
 That is, we are not ready yet, we are preparing
 kya aap chahenge ki rus yaa america hamaara aapkaa data lekar aisa chunavi campan chalaa de jiske jhaanse main ham sab aa jaaen or ham aisi sarkaar chun len jo baad main hamaari hi jeb kaatane lage
 Make it difficult to live isi ko kehete hai ki data se chunaav prabhavit kiya ja rahaa he
 Yet many people do not understand how elections can be affected
 hamane yahi sawaal rakesh se poocha jo belatbox india naam kii sanstha chalaate hai
 We are a new institution, we do not know much
 ab aate hai maujuuda vivaad par
 You know that since Trump won, the United States has been investigating whether Russia interfered in this election, meaning that Russia ran a propaganda on its behalf that benefited Trump

 isiilie duniya bhar main research chal rahaa he ki kahin data ke istamaal se loktantr hi na samaapt ho jaae
 It is being understood that what is wrong, what is right
 lekin bharat main congress or bijepi is tarah ek duusare par aarope laga rahi hai jaise in donon ne sabakuch samaj liya ho
 In December 2016, Carole Cadwalladr, a US design professor, during her research found Cambrian Analita's role in the US election and her connection to the campaign to separate Britain from the European Union
 cambridge analitica ko 5 karod se adhik amareeki nagarikon kaa data ek research se mila
 This researcher had created an app, which people associated with their consent
 jaise fasebuk par bahut se ap aate hai, aap clic kar judane lag jate hai or ai agri kaa batan dabaa dete hai
 Either you do not understand or become careless, on the other hand, the app takes all your information and sells it to a third party
 vah company us data kaa istemaal raajnneetik kii hawa badalane main karti he yaa kisi product ko bechney main karti he
 This is what happened in this dispute
 ab paanch dinon tak fasebuk ke mark zukarbarg ne mana ki bahut badi galati ho gai he
 Arrangements will be made for this to not happen from now on
 data or privesi se jude log kehete hai ki yah kaaphi nahin he
 It should not be possible to tell Zuckerberg that what the app that stole data before 2014 is doing what they are doing, because the number of apps is in thousands
 ham or aap fasebuk kaa istemaal karte hai
 There is a trust, but if the information gets passed on to someone else, then the trust is broken
 or us jaankaree kaa istemaal aapke raajnneetik mat ko prabhavit karne main rus yaa america main baithi koi company kar le to sidhaa matlab yah hua ki loktantr technolji ke kaaran kabhi bhi khatre main pad saktaa he
 You see that this is happening in many places
 ek baar jo satta main aa rahaa he, wo haar hi nahin rahaa he
 Look at the President of Russia, Putin, the President of China has sat on the throne for a lifetime
 bharat main koi is tarah kaa sapana na dekhe isliye janata ko is vishay ko lekar satark ho janaa chahie
 This is the issue of Facebook, but you should think that due to Aadhaar number, this danger is not close
 america, italy, france or germany main aadhaar number nahin he, bharat main aadhaar number he
 Lest democracy should run out in the name of saving subsidies

 Whenever the question of evms is hacked in India, we make fun
 sabase badi daleel he ki chunaav ayog par shaq kaise kar sakate hai
 We should not forget that during this election commission booths were looted for decades
 ayog ne nahin, ek vyakti ne ayog ko bharose laayak banaaya tha
 Do you think that people do not have faith in the Election Commission of America, France, Italy, Germany
 phir bhi vahaan bahes ho rahi he ki technalji se kahin riselt yaa chunaav kii prakriya ko prabhavit to nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 There was a lot of discussion before the general election in Germany
 vahaan ke fedral offis for di protection of di constitution ke pramukh ne kaha tha ki chunaav ko hack karnaa, baahar se prabhavit karnaa bilkul sambhav he
 Was reading a report that said there is a counting software in Germany which is pc-wahl, it can be hacked
 iske data ko ched kar riselt badla ja saktaa he
 Such questions are taken seriously in those countries, this is the answer to all such questions here, how can we doubt the Election Commission
 yahi puch lijie ki chunaav ayog ke paas aisi sambhaavna ko rokane ke liye system hi kya he
 Rakesh of Balletbox India had recently written a long letter and warned against these dangers, but got the same answer, but now the answer is beginning to be understood
 tippaniyan This is a complex issue but easy to understand
 kya hoga ki aap sahmati se apni jaankaree kisi ap ko de den, or vah uskaa istamaal kisi or kaam ke liye kar le
 As in the case of Crambin Analytica

 Whenever the question of evms is hacked in India, we make fun
 sabase badi daleel he ki chunaav ayog par shaq kaise kar sakate hai
 We should not forget that during this election commission booths were looted for decades
 ayog ne nahin, ek vyakti ne ayog ko bharose laayak banaaya tha
 Do you think that people do not have faith in the Election Commission of America, France, Italy, Germany
 phir bhi vahaan bahes ho rahi he ki technalji se kahin riselt yaa chunaav kii prakriya ko prabhavit to nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 There was a lot of discussion before the general election in Germany
 vahaan ke fedral offis for di protection of di constitution ke pramukh ne kaha tha ki chunaav ko hack karnaa, baahar se prabhavit karnaa bilkul sambhav he
 Was reading a report that said there is a counting software in Germany which is pc-wahl, it can be hacked
 iske data ko ched kar riselt badla ja saktaa he
 Such questions are taken seriously in those countries, this is the answer to all such questions here, how can we doubt the Election Commission
 yahi puch lijie ki chunaav ayog ke paas aisi sambhaavna ko rokane ke liye system hi kya he
 Rakesh of Balletbox India had recently written a long letter and warned against these dangers, but got the same answer, but now the answer is beginning to be understood
 tippaniyan This is a complex issue but easy to understand
 kya hoga ki aap sahmati se apni jaankaree kisi ap ko de den, or vah uskaa istamaal kisi or kaam ke liye kar le

 That 2016 was the second week of November
 notebandi ko keval das din beete the or janata ke paas maujuud bade noton kaa lagbhag 40 fisadi hissaa bainkon main pahunchaa chukaa tha
 The remaining cash was reaching petrol pumps, schools, hospitals where it was allowed to be accepted
 isi dauraan rigerv bank ne yah bataanaa band kar diya ki bank khaaton main jamaa kis tarah bad rahaa he or iske saath hi yah tay ho gaya ki shaayad adhikansh nakadi bainkon main waapas ho rahi he
 The signal of return of 99 percent of the demonetised notes to banks was found only in June last year
 ab in khisiaye spashtikarnon kaa koi arth nahin he ki notebandi ke baad iskar ritern yaa tex bharne vaale bade hai
 Was the purpose of demonetisation-like demonetisation and lethal risk correcting the habit of filing income tax returns? And the cash in the market has increased so much that the debate of cashless or less cash economy has become irrelevant
 darasal, notebandi ke bade rahasy abhi bhi poshida hai
 If the Reserve Bank and the Government will answer some questions to the country, then we will be able to know what happened during the biggest upheaval in the economic history of India and perhaps in this we can get some sources of black money, for which it is so Life-threatening risk was taken
 koun the ve "garib'' jinhone lakhon kii taadaad main jandhan khate khole or notebandi ke dauraan puraane or nae khaaton main karodon rupye jamaa kiye? notebandi ke thik baad 23
 30 crore new Jan Dhan accounts were opened
 inamen se 80 fisadi sarkari bainkon main khule
 At the time of demonetisation (9 November 2016), a total of 456 billion rupees were deposited in these accounts which reached 746 billion rupees on 7 December 2016
 jandhan khaaton ke durupyog kii khabaron ke bich sarkaar ne 15 november 2016 ko jandhan khaaton main rakam jamaa karne ke liye 50,000 rupye kii upree seemaa tay kar di thi
 The Finance Minister had told Parliament in February last year that the Income Tax Department had sent 5,100 notices to various account holders (including Jan Dhan), after which the investigation into the use of Jan Dhan in demonetisation was lost somewhere! Will we ever get to know that demonetization How much money was transacted through Government / PSU accounts in Government (central and State) treasuries and banks during the days? It is worth mentioning that government departments and services were free from the immediate limits of demonetisation or cash transactions
 kai sarkari sevaaon ko pratibandhit noton main bhugtan lene kii ijaajat di gai thi
 The country should not get the data of how much old cash was exchanged through the network of government services departments? During demonetisation, we do not have any information about how many old notes reached the banks through current accounts and cash transactions 
 baad kii padtaal main kai chhadam (shell) companiyaan mani londring main shaamil pai gayi
 In such a situation, it is reasonable to expect that the government will have enough information about the use of business cash accounts
 notebandi ke dauraan badi companiyon main nakadi kii awajahi kii padtaal kii jaankaree un logon ko milani chahie jo apane kuch saikadaa rupye badalawaane ke liye notebandi kii linon main bilakh rahe the
 Does the country not have the right to know how many transactions took place in the accounts of political parties during demonetisation and at the time when people did not have the cash to buy medicines in hospitals, where and how was spent on political fights It is worth mentioning that when the common people were giving the fire test of demonetisation, the government allowed political parties to deposit old notes of 500 rupees and 1,000 rupees in their accounts, Every kind of investigation were excluded
 desh ke liye yah bhi jaananaa jaruri he ki notebandi ke dauraan bainkon main jo bhrashtachar hua uski jaanch aakhir kahaan rukii hui he
 The Reserve Bank has stated its point
 ab sarkaar ko sawaalon se aankh milaanaa hi hoga
 Where is it written that governments cannot be wrong
 duniya ke har desh main sarkarein kism-kism kii galtiyaan karti hai lekin ve unhen sweekaar bhi karti hai
 Crores of common people of India have proved their honesty by meditating in demonetisation
 ab agni pariksha se guzarane kii baari sarkaar kii he

 In those days the name "mahajan" was used to show respect to the people of the elite class
 gandhi ne "mahajan" naam ko "majur" yaa mazdooron ke naam se jodakar saamaajik sanrachana ko ulat diya
 With that literal alternative, Gandhi increased the pride of the workers and Gandhi associated common goods with mass politics

 udhar rajya sarkaar ke pravaktaa or khaadya aapurti mantri dinesh gundu raav ne naaraazgi jataate hue kaha ki anupama kaa vyavhaar ek adhikari vaala nahin he
 If he had a complaint, he should have talked to the Home Minister to the DGP and other senior officials, which he did not do, but after resigning, he has gone off the mobile in such a way that even his senior officers are unable to contact
 buudhvaar ko pehali baar karnataka ke shram mantri parameshwar nayak media ke saamne aae or safai di ki anupama ke istife se unka koi lenaa dena nahin he or naa hi iske liye wo zimmedaar hai
 It is said that he ordered to stop an illegal pub being built at a bus stand in the rural area of bellary but the action was not taken due to pressure from Labor Minister Parameshwara
 or isliye unhone istipha diya
 Actually Anupama resigned on June 4, and after that, the information related to her is coming only through Facebook
 tazaa apadet main kaha gaya he ki agar shram mantri parameshwar nayak istipha den to anupama apana istipha waapas le sakati hai
 Then further came a post that a CD would be released which would expose the Parameshwara Nayak
 ab is fasebuk post ko lekar bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki kisi ne anupama kaa acount hack kiya he or vahi post kar rahaa he
 No one knows what is true because unless Anupama comes out of the unknown and does not speak, it is difficult to say anything
 tippaniyan Anupama is a 2010 batch Karnataka Provincial Civil Services officer and was selected as DSP
 taqariban chah maheenaa pehle anumapa or shrammantri kaa taqaraar tab saamne aayaa tha jab shram mantri ne bhaashan ke dauraan kaha ki unhone hi anupama kaa transafar karavaaya tha kyonki anupama ne unka phone hold par rakh diya tha
 Even if the government accepts her resignation, she can withdraw her resignation as per the provisions within 60 days after the notification

 The latest update has said that Anupama can withdraw her resignation if Labor Minister Parameshwara Nayak resigns
 phir aage ye bhi post aayaa ki ek sidi jari kii jaaegi jo parameshwar nayak ko benaqaab karegi
 Now it is also being said about this Facebook post that someone has hacked Anupama's account and is posting the same
 sach kya he koi nahin jaanata kyonki jabatak anupama agyatavaas se baahar aakar apni baat nahin rakhti tabatak kuch bhi kahana mushkil he

 About six months ago, the dispute between Anupama and the Labor Minister came to light when the Labor Minister said during the speech that he was the one who transferred Anupama because Anupama had put her phone on hold
 sarkaar agar unka istipha manzur karti he to bhi notification ke baad 60 dinon ke andar praavdhaanon ke mutabik wo apana istipha waapas le sakati hai

 However, later Jeetan Ram Manjhi described it as 'slipping of tongue'
 bihar main mahagathbandhan ke mahatvapurn netaa jithan ram maanjhi ne yah bayaan ek prashn main uttar diya tha
 This question was related to declaring Masood of the United Nations as a global terrorist
 darasal, ek video main maanjhi yah kehete huye dikh rahe hai ki ‘kya vaajapeyi sarkaar masood ajahar sahib ko vimaan se qandahar nahin le gai thi
 'earlier in the first week of April, Abdus Subhan, MLA from Bais (purnia) of RJD, spoke to Masood Azhar at a rally organized in Kishanganj
 ham ke pravaktaa danish rigwan ne, haalanki, unka bachaav karte huye kaha ki maanjhi kah chuke hai ki yah mahaj jubaan kaa phisalana tha
 In addition, on Friday, President of Hindustani Awam Morcha and former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, who called global terrorist Masood Azhar as 'sahab', described Union ministers Giriraj Singh and Sadhvi Pragya Thakur as linguistic terrorists
 maanjhi ne yahaan patrakaron se kaha ki giriraaj singh or sadhvi pragna kii bhashaa ek aatankwaadi kii bhashaa he, ou ye bhashaai aatankwaadi hai, jo samaaj main nafrat kaa jehar ghol rahe hai

 amit shah ne kaha ki faruk abdulla ghar par hi hai
 He has neither been detained, nor has he had any problem
 baar-baar faruk abdulla kaa maamla uthaae jane par amit shah ko kahana padaa ki agar vah nahin aana chaahate hai to ham isamen kya kar sakate hai
 Can not force them to bring them here by putting guns on their temples
 kai saansadon ne kaha ki vah biimaar hai
 Some mps said that they are not being allowed to come
 ise lekar grahamantri amit shah ne kaha ki faruk abdulla ekadam thik hai
 At home
 naa unako ditten kiya gaya he naa unako roka gaya he
 He is not coming here on his own free will
 to isamen ham kya kar sakate hai?vahiin congress ke adheer ranjan choudhary ne bhi kaha ki faruk abdulla kii tabiyat kharaab he jiske baad amit shah ko phir bolnaa padaa ki agar unki tabiyat kharaab he to vah aspataal ja sakate hai, doctoron ko bula sakate hai
 Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla also said that Amit Shah should send a special team of doctors for him
