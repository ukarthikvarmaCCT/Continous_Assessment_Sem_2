 On Thursday, the violence continues for the third consecutive day

 The reason behind the boiling of the Malwa region is that the Indore market here ranks in the big market of the state and the farmers here are more organized
 yogi kii kisaan karj maafee bani aakhri kilshivaraj singh chouhan janvari maheene main narmada yatra shuru kii thi, jo ki chaar maheenon tak chali
 During this period, organizations like Bhartiya Kisan Union associated with RRS started collecting farmers
 is dauraan kisaanon kii karj maafee ke yogi sarkaar ke faisle ne kisaanon ke sabar kaa baandh tod diya or unhone apane puure karj maaf karne tathaa fasalon behatar keemat kii maang ko lekar 1 june se andolan kaa elaan kar diya
 During this time, due to the bumper crop of onion, its reduced prices also added fuel to the fire, where farmers are forced to sell onions for up to one and a half rupees per kg
 kisaan andolan ke bich yoga shivi ke udghaatan main biji krishi mantripyaaj ne nikaale kisaanon ke aansaapane gehun ke liye mashhoor madhya pradesh main sarkaar ne kisaanon ko apni fasalon main vividhta laane ke liye prerit kiya
 As a result, farmers started cultivating onions
 haalanki pichley saal or is saal hui banpar fasal kii vajah se unke liye pyaaj par laagat bhi nikaalnaa bhi mushkil ho gaya
 After a lot of efforts, the state government reduced the minimum support price (MSP) on onion to Rs 6 per kg last year
 vahiin is saal kisaanon ke andolan ke baad emspi badhaakar 8 rupee kiya gaya, jabaki kisaanon kaa kahan he ki pyaaj kii kheti main prati kilo 4-5 rupee tak kii unki laagat hi baithti he
 After the note ban due to demonetisation, the government started fully digital payments in all areas including farming
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki kisaanon ko apni fasal ke badale check main pement milane laga, jisase unke haathon main paise aane main or deree hui
 After the farmers' protest, the government bowed a little in front of their demands, but still half the payment was getting cash, while the rest was going to the bank accounts
 kisaanon main nakadi kii kami ko lekar bhi gussa tha
 Amid growing anger among the farmers in the RSS to the farmers union, Shivraj Singh on Monday announced to just meet the Indian Farmers Union in Ujjain and raise the MSP of onions to Rs 8
 haalanki yah baat bhartiya kisaan union ko nagavar gujri or usee raat ne unhone virodh pradarshan shuru kar diya
 During this time, the farmers' movement became fierce, some farmers uprooted the fish-plate of the railway line at Mandsaur
 is dauraan ugr bheed ko kaabo main karne ke liye police ne firing kii, jisamen 5 kisaanon kii maut ho gai
 Violence erupted in the state after this incident and immediately it caught nine districts of Malwa

 The incidents of farmer suicides were seen in many states, but the statements of CM Shivraj on many occasions did not embrace the farmers
 unhone saaf kiya tha ki kisaan aatmahatya kii sabhi ghatnaon ke peeche karj samasya hi vajah nahin
 Apart from this, there was resentment among the farmers about the time-and-time statements of Shivraj's ministers
 modi ke chunavi vadepradhanmantri narendra modi apane chunavi kaarykram ke dauraan kisaanon ko unki laagat par 50% munafa sunishchit karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 However, the Minister of Agriculture Radhamohan Singh had already raised his hand saying that this is not possible
 vahiin satta main aane se pehle bijepi ne swaminathan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne kaa mudda jor-shor se uthaaya, lekin sarkaar banane ke baad is par chuppi saadh gai

 Whenever a passport is issued to any person, he has to tell whether a police case is going on against him or not
 Neelam Krishnamurthy alleges that Sushil Ansal gave a false affidavit to the Passport Office that there was no case against him
 And despite all the information about the gift case, the passport authorities also issued him a new passport

 Bhagwana Dattatreya is also called "smritamnaguranta" and "smrutargami" because he reaches his devotees only after remembering
 mana jaataa he ki bhagwaan dattatreya ne 24 guruon se shiksha praapt kii thi
 On hearing this condition of the Brahmins, Anasuya became very worried and then she came to know the truth of the Brahmins with her tapobal
 bhagwaan vishnu or apane pati atri ko yaad karne ke baad anusuya ne kaha ki yadi unka pativrata dharm satya he to teenon brahman 6 maheene ke shishu ban jaaen
 Anusuya made the three children infant with her tapobal and then took milk in her lap and kept the three in her cradle

 Then Narada ji reached him and told all the events

 The three goddesses then apologized to Anusuya and urged them to bring their husbands to the original form
 tab anusuya, apane tapobal se tridevon ko unke purv swaroop main le ain
 After this, Tridev asked him to ask for boon and then Anusuya demanded to get those three gods in the form of son

 a unique survey has revealed that a bank robber is able to earn far less than an honest person
 sasex or saare vishvavidhyalay ke shodhakartaaon ne apni tarah ke is abhootpurv surveykshan main britain main bank luteron kii kamai kaa vishleshan kiya
 Experts claim that the common marauder escapes by robbing an average of 12,706 pounds, which is less than the salary of an honest employee in six months on average
 haalanki tivi main dikhaaya jaataa he ki lutere noton se bhare bag lekar bhaag rahe hote hai, jabaki asaliyat main vah teen bainko main se ek se khaali haath hi lautate hai
 According to a report in the Daily Mail, the robbers are at risk of being caught by police with high-tech equipment
 saath hi saath pakade jane par adaalat dwaara lambi jail kii sajaa bhi di jaati hai
 According to the facts, if a marauder loots several banks continuously to improve his financial condition, then on average, after the fourth robbery he is caught and put in jail
 shodhakartaaon ne british bankers association se kai vicitra data jutaye ki ab tak kitni lut hui or kitne main hathiyaaron kaa istemaal hua
 The researchers found that robberies in the UK averaged 20,331 pounds, and that each member received 12,706 pounds according to the number of robbers
 surveykshan ke anusaar hathiyaaron ke saath lut ko anjaam dene vaale lutere zyada maal batorte hai, jitna bada giroh hota he lut kaa maal bhi utana hi zyada hota he
 On the arrival of an additional member, the total amount of loot increases by £ 9,033, but the share of each robber decreases
 shodhakartaaon ne suraksha maapdandon jaise alarm se lekar staff tak ke kaam karne ke tareekon ko bhi parkhaa
 Loot incidents were reduced by one-third due to security-installed screens, but the screens were installed in only one in 10 banks in the UK, being highly expensive
 saare vishvavidhyalay ke professor nil ricoman ne kaha ki yah shodh darshata he ki bank lootnaa koi phaayde kaa sauda nahin he
 He said that this study does not explain the adverse effects on social status of those who carry out work such as robbery, and the injuries suffered during such risky work
 unhone kaha ki aparaadh karne main phayda he yaa nahin is sawaal kaa jawaab aapke is vichaar par nirbhar karata he ki 20,331 pound kii rakam ke liye itnaa jokhim uthaaya ja saktaa he yaa nahin
 By the way, he said, 'I believe it is a profitable deal for a group of criminals who work hard to do their job and do their work in a very professional manner

 ye bartan mid de mile ke liye skool kii rasoi main rakhe gaye hai
 The children of the school say that no one else does the work of washing dishes and sweeping, so the children only have to do it at the behest of the teacher

 As far as education is concerned, teachers do not come to school in time
 aise main bachche idhar-udhar ghoomte rahete hai
 When the matter was brought to the notice of Rekha Suman, the Basic Education Officer (BSA) of Hathras, he gave the assurance of action, calling it completely wrong
 gauratlab he ki aise hi pehle ek skool main bacchon se ghaas kataane kaa maamla biese kii jaankaree main aayaa tha to unhone jaanch ke baad karrwai kii baat kahi thi
 The question of no action yet in that case was asked by the BSA, so she could not give any direct answer

 teen rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main mayawati ko saath lekar bijepi ko haraane ke khwab dekh rahi congress ko bada jhatka laga he
 All the claims of the coalition went up
 ab congress in rajyon main akele dam par bijepi se morcha lene ko majaboor ho gayi he
 Although, according to Congress sources, this was likely to happen in today's situation, but she still considers the option with Mayawati open in the 2019 general elections
 congress sutron ke mutabik, centre sarkaar kii jaanch agenciyon ke dabaav ke chalate mayawati ke saath teen rajyon main gathjod kii sambhaavna naa ke hi baraabar thi
 Although the party's Rajasthan unit was not in favor of the alliance, but in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the party wanted an alliance with the BSP
 is bich party sutron kaa kahana he ki jis tarah aanan-fanan main mayawati ne chhattisgarh main ajit jogi ke saath samjhauta kiya, tabhi party ke ranneetikaron ko laga ki maamla kuch or he
 That is, it is not going to happen even in MP
 sutron ke mutabik, jab mayawati ne madhya pradesh main siten maangin to unamem kareeb aadhi ve siten thim, jahaan muqabla congress-bijepi ke bich hota aayaa he
 In such a situation, bjp's victory could be confirmed by giving those seats to BSP
 aise main madhya pradesh congress ne alaakaman ko bataa diya ki shaayad mayawati bijepi ke dabaav main hai, isiliye wo aisi sharten rakh raheen hai, jo madhya pradesh congress ke lieye maananaa naammumkin sa tha
 After this it was decided that compromise in MP would not be possible
 uske baad hi digvijay singh ne khulkar mayawati par bijepi ke dabaav kaa bayaan de daalaa
 This caused Mayawati to harass Digvijay and Congress
 lekin itnaa sab hone ke baad bhi congress ke aalaa sutron kaa kahana he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke kareeb aane tak kendriya jaanch agenciyon kaa shikanja kamjor ho jayega, us surat main mayawati par dabaav kaam nahin karegaa or tab samjhaute kii gunjaaish banane kii sambhaavna he
 According to him, Mayawati has kept the window open for 2019 by saying that she wants rahul-sonia's alliance
 congress sutara ye bhi maanate hai ki basapa teen rajyon main congress ke saath gathbandhan na karke aisa dabaav kaa maahaul bananaa chaahati he taaki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle agar gathbandhan hota bhi he to zyada se zyada siton par daavedaari kii ja sake
 On this whole issue, senior Congress leader RPN Singh told Aaj Tak, "our president has already advocated alliances with state-wise like-minded parties for 2019, so options are open for big battles in future
" saath hi mayawati ji ne jab ye kaha he ki,rahul-soniyagajod ke haq main hai to 2019 ke liye teenon baithkar baat kar hi sakate hai or jo bhi silawatein hai usko thik kar sakate hai

 or ab nayaa kirdaar sanjeev khanna bhi aa chukaa he
 Indrani's ex-husband
 isse wo sab poocha jayega jo ab tak indrani or sanjeev khanna ne ugala he
 Police are also playing a game of psychology in such investigations
 ek police afasar jo jaanch main shaamil hai wo ab is nattejey par pahunch chuke hai ki indrani kii soch behad shaatiranaa he
 And what he has told so far is like a professional vicious mind
 is puri jaanch main jo kirdaar baahar hai wo lagaataar khaar police stesan aa ja rahe hai
 It is the effort of the police that these characters no longer talk to the media
 vaise jo kuch media main chap rahaa he wo police kii sochi line par hi aa rahaa he
 The comments kamishnar kaa anubhav is jaanch main kaam aayega
 But when the head of police investigates a murder by going to the police station itself, it has its own disadvantages
 phayda ye ho saktaa he ki police kaa adana afasar kisi bade rakhukhdaar ke dabaav main nahin aayega
 There will be no such disturbance in the investigation, so that the entire land gets divided
 lekin nuksaar puure shahar kaa or aane vaale kamishnaron kaa hoga
 While the investigation of Sheena's death is being done in the city, there are many more crimes happening at the same time
 aise main kya police kamishnar kii duty sirf ek aparaadh kii jaanch he? yaa phir use baraabar vakt or sirf ek maardarshak kii bhoomika nibhaani chaiye? nuksaan ye bhi he ki har hatya ke baad kya janata nahin chaahegi ki kamishnar isi tarah kii dakhlandaji karen? kya ye hamaare system main itnaa vakt or sansaadhan hai ki aisa kiya ja sake
 People will question, what is the reason that the commissioner does the high profile investigation himself? guuruuvaar kii raat to 8 ghante chali poochtacha raat ko 10
 30 buzzes ended
 krime reporting karne waalon kii haalat buree he
 Are guarded outside the police station
 koi ardli bhi nikalataa he to unhen lagata he ki shaayad koi choti si jaankaree mil jaae
 All police sources are numb at the moment
 koi sahi khabar kaise li kar de jab kamishnar khud sara hisaab kitaab rakh rahe hai
 When the commissioner sits, his special officer is also present there
 ye log unke ishaare par kadiyaan jodne kaa kaam karte hai
 It is not that everyone is being interrogated during the investigation
 puraa kaam alag-alag team kar rahi hai
 a team is interrogating the driver
 usase jo kuch miltaa he usee ke aadhaar par indrani se sawaal jawaab hote hai
 And now the new character Sanjeev Khanna has also arrived
 indrani kaa purv pati he
 It will be asked all that Indrani and Sanjeev Khanna have sprung up till now
 aisi jaanch main police manovigyaan kaa khel bhi khel rahi he
 a police officer who is involved in the investigation has now reached the conclusion that Indrani's thinking is very vicious
 or usne jo kuch ab tak bataaya he wo kisi peshewar shaatir dimag jaisaa he
 The characters who are out in this entire investigation are constantly coming to Khar Police Station
 police kii koshish he ki ye kirdaar ab media se zyada baat na karen
 By the way, whatever is appearing in the media is coming on the police's thought line
 tippaniyan The commissioner's experience will help in this investigation
 lekin police ke mukhiya jab ek murder kii jaanch khud police stesan main jaakar karte hai to iske apane nafe nuksaan hai
 The advantage can be that the police officer will not come under the pressure of a big caretaker
 koi aisi gadabadi jaanch main nahin hogi jisase saare kiye dhare kaa bantaadhaar ho jaae
 But the damage will be done by the commissioners of the entire city and coming
 shahar main jab shina kii maut kii jaanch ho rahi he tab usee vakt kai or krime ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, is the police commissioner's duty just a crime investigation? Or should he play equal time and just a guide? The disadvantage is that after every murder, wouldn't the public want the commissioner to intervene in a similar way? Is it enough time and resources in our system to do this? log sawaal to karenge hi kya vajah he ki kamishnar sahab hai profile jaanch khud karte hai?

 par zaraa sochen agar zindagi khud hi maut ban kar dusron ko maut baantne lag jaae to kya ho? paris main hue hamale kii kahani kuch aisi he kyonki is hamale main jis hayaat par begunaahon ko maut dene kaa ilzaam he, ittefaq se uskaa naam hayaat hi he
 But a new twist has come in the matter regarding Hyatt
 darasal french police kaa daawa he ki paris hamale ke dauraan hayaat mauka-e-vaardaat par maujuud thi
 While three thousand kilometers from Paris, Turkish police say Hyatt was in Turkey
 ab ek hayaat ek saath do jagah kaise ho sakati he?france kii most wanted aurat or aatanki hamalon kii mulgim hayaat boumedini ko lekar rahasy kii dhundh aisi chai he ki duniya kii dhakad suraksha agenciyon kii ankhon ke saamne dhuaan chaa gaya he
 The good people do not understand how a person can be in two places at the same time? Because on the one hand, the French police are claiming that during the attack on a two policemen in Paris and the attack on a super market named hypercashor, terrorist Emidi Colibelli was also present along with his wife Hayat Boumedini
 vahiin duusari taraf france se saadhe teen hazaar kilometre dur turki kii sarkaar ye kar rahi he ki hamale ke dauraan colibeli kii patni boumedini to kisi or ladke ke saath turki main dekhi gai or naa sirf dekhi gai balki turki kii agenciyon ne lagaataar uskaa peechha bhi kiya
 Now the question is that if Boumedini was in Turkey during the attack, who was with Coulibelli in Paris? And if she was any other woman, then how did the French police talk about seeing Boumedini there during the attacks? And how did the police declare Boumedini as the most wanted of this attack? If these things of Turkey and these CCTV footage are correct, then the question arises that if she stayed in Turkey and Syria on 8 and 9 January during the attack , Then how are the French police claiming to have seen him on the occasion? And if he is not really guilty of attacks, then why is he mysteriously missing from his house after this attack? And most importantly, where is Boumedini right now? Obviously, all these questions have confused everyone at the moment
 to kya paris par hua hamalaa al-kaayda or iesas kaa ek joint oparation tha? kya iske peeche saadhe teen foot ke jehadi commander mistar marlboro kaa haath tha? hamale ke turant baad isaki most wanted mulgim hayaat jis tarah se syria main gum ho gai or jis tarah france ne africa ke registan main mistar marlboro kii talash shuru kii he usase to kuch aisa hi lagata he
 Allegations of disturbances in evms were not yet being taken seriously in the corridors of power
 lekin mangalvaar ko aam aadmi party ke vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj ne dilli vidhansabha ke bheetar chhedchhad kaa demo dekar ise sadan kii karrwai main shaamil karvaa diya
 The result of evms changed from secret code, Saurabh Bhardwaj, a software engineer who has been a professional, explained step-by-step how to manipulate evms
 unhone ek iviem jaisi mashin main aam aadmi party ko 10 bispi ko 2, congress ko 2, bijepi ko 3 or samaajawaadee party ko 2 vot diye
 He then explained how these results can be changed with the help of secret code
 unke mutabik iviem main har party kaa ek sikret code hota he
 If a common voter also enters the secret code of the party of his choice through voting, then all the votes cast after that will go to that party
 bharadwaj ne bijepi kaa code daalkar bataaya ki kis tarah bijepi ko 11 jabaki baaki sabhi partiyon ko 2-2 vot hasil hue
 Election Commission's EVM fix in 90 seconds! Saurabh Bhardwaj admitted that the EVM he used was just a proto-type
 lekin chunaav ayog kii iviem kaa madraboard mahaj 90 second main badalakar aise hi sikret code daalane kii deree hoti he or kisi bhi iviem ko fiks kiya ja saktaa he
 He claimed that if the evms used in the Gujarat elections were given to him for 3 hours, he would not let the BJP win a single booth
 chunaav ayog kii safivahin, chunaav ayog ne is masale par koi aadhikarik pratikriya dene se inkaar kar diya he
 According to the Commission, a statement will be made on this issue only after the meeting of all the parties on May 12
 haalanki ayog ke sutron ne saaf kiya he ki jis mashin kaa istemaal saurabh bharadwaj ne sadan main kiya wo mahaj ek proto-tip he
 If sources are to be believed, no type of code is used in the machines of the Commission
 naa hi in mashiinon ke madraboard ko badla ja saktaa he
 The machines that the Election Commission allows to use are blocked after pressing the button
 lihaaja koi bhi sikret code nahin daal saktaa he

 The film's story provides context for the 1971 Partition of Pakistan, which resulted in the creation of a new country, Bangladesh

 So it should be shown in school
 bataa den ki jab tak film ko universal certificate nahin milegaa tab tak yah bacchon ko nahin dikhaai ja sakati he
 To this, the bench said that CBFC was pretending that such issues do not exist, by asking them to remove such scenes in films
 sibiefasi kii is baat se gussaye justise patel ne sibiefasi se kaha ki apane sir ko jameen main dabaa len or aisa dikhaane kii koshish karen jo he hi nahin
 How can the board say that it will give u / a certificate to the film
 chaahe film se aise seens or apmanjanak shabd hataa die gaye hon
 Justice Patel said, 'we are surprised if the people of CBFC do not have children of their own
 sibiefasi aap certification board hai sensor board nahin
 You will not decide who wants to see what
 ' lekin bench ne kaha ki duniya badal rahi he
 Along with this, the way of telling the story is also changing

 After the attack on Army School Pataliban in Peshawar, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has spoken of fighting against terror till his last breath
 khabar aa rahi he ki pakistan ke sena pramukh rahil sharif ne unase 3000 aatankiyon kii faansee par lagi pabandi hataane kii baat kahi thi, jise unhone manjuur kar diya he
 However, after Tuesday, Sharif had given the figure 500
 baharhaal, sankhya chaahe jo bhi ho par yahaan sawaal manshaa kaa he, kyonki navaj ke daawey ke turant baad mumbai hamale ke aaropee lashkar commander jackieur rahamaan lakhvi kii bel kii khabar saamne ai, jis par idhar bharat main kadi pratikriya dekhi gai
 Now the question arises that under the 'war Against Terror' will the old formula of selectively kill terrorists be changed or will the policy change? The news is also coming that the Pakistan government will oppose Lakhvi's bail

 Mention also of Kargil

 It should also be a matter of the Taliban who have been dropping dead bodies in Pakistan for years, yet Sharif's heart does not diminish the love for Taliban fighters
 ek sach yah he ki sharif kii sarkaar ke paas wo takat hi nahin he ki vah aatankiyon ke safaaye ke liye koi thos kadam uthaa sake to doosraa pahalu yah bhi he ki takat to chodo kya manshaa bhi he? aaie jaanate hai kuch aise hi facts jo navaj ke vaade or daawey donon par sawaal khadey karte hai

 Sharif visited military bases in Skardu near Kargil on 29 January 1999, pictures of which were also revealed
 'ek sipaahi kii sargujasht’ naam kii kitaab main general ajij ne likhaa ki kargil jang kii sajeesh chaar logon ne milakar rachi thi

 gauratlab he ki pakistan ke punjab praant main lashkar-e-jhangavi or taliban donon kaa dabadabaa he
 That is why Sharif has been an advocate of negotiations with the Taliban for many years
 musharraf ne kaha tha 'taliban kaa dost'pakistan ke purv raashtrapati or general parvej musharraf ne to ek samay navaj sharif ko 'taliban kaa dost' tak qaraar de diya tha

 laden ne sharif se yah bhi kaha tha ki chunaav jeetne ke baad unki sarkaar pakistan ko hard line islamic state banane kii disha main kaam karegi
 Later, Benazir Bhutto also accused Sharif of winning the election with Laden's help

 a human chain created in Bihar in support of alcohol ban gave a new message to the world
 is maanav shrinkhalaa ne vishwa record banaakar apana utsaah dikhaaya tha
 Similarly, against child marriage and dowry, Bihar is ready to give a new message to the whole world once again by joining hands

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has appealed to the people of Bihar to participate in the human chain

 This time also preparations have been made in this manner, in which 13654 including all the districts of the state
 37 kimi lambii maanav shrinkhalaa banegi

 jo ab badhkar 16 lakh se upar ho gaye hai
 Among the slogans written, 1,83,000 in Madhubani, 55,000 in Aurangabad, 52920 in Khagaria, 47862 in Banka and 43068 in Samastipur are raising public awareness

 But this time there is no such indication from the opposition party RJD and Congress, whereas in the last human chain, both parties were in the ruling party

 Despite fast bowler Zaheer Khan's five wickets, Australia kept their upper hand somewhat on the second day of the first Test cricket by sending the Indian opening pair to the pavilion after the courageous innings of the tail batsmen
 shen watson kii lagbhag saadhe saat ghante tak chali 126 ran kii marathon pari ke baad austrailia ke nichle kram ke ballebaajon visheshkar tim pen (92) or mishael janson (47) ne bhi bharat ko raahat kii saans nahin lene di jisase vah 428 ran kaa majboot score khadaa karne main safal rahaa
 Zaheer took five wickets for 94 runs
 bharat ko virendra sahvaag (59) or gautam gambhir (25) ne acchhee shuruyaat dilaayi or pehle wicket ke liye 81 ran kii saajhedaari kii lekin janson ne in donon khatarnaak ballebaajon ko 25 ran ke antaraal main pavilion bhejkar bhartiya kheme ko niraash kar diya
 Rahul Dravid was playing for 21 at the time of stump up, while nightwatchman Ishant Sharma has to open the account
 sahvaag or gambhir ne shuru main puri satarkta dikhaayi
 Sehwag, however, did not keep quiet from showing his sharp stance for long and opened his hands with two fours off Doug Bollinger in the fourth over
 unhone iske baad bhi austrailian tej gendbaajon ke khilaaf koi narmi nahin dikhaayi or jab spinner nathan haritz aaye to unki pehali do gend ko cover kshetra se seemaa rekha paar bheja
 He completed his 23rd Test half-century off just 38 balls
 naye ballebaaj dravid ne janson ke isi over main pyaari se phultas ko khubasurat cover drive se chaar ran ke liye bhejkar apana khaataa kholaa
 Sehwag, however, could not dominate as he did after completing his half-century and he was caught by Michael Clarke on the cover off Johnson's short pitch ball
 sahvaag ne 54 gend kii apni pari main das chauke lagaaye
 Earlier, Australia batted as slow as they did in the first session and scored only 71 runs in 29 overs
 usne duusare satr main 95 ran jode jisamen janson or pen ke bich 22 over main 82 ran kii saajhedaari mahatvapurn rahi
 Watson extended the score to 224 for five in the morning and shared a 53-run partnership for the sixth wicket
 kal do jeevandaan paane vaale watasan ne subah jab apane score main keval do ran jode the tab jahir kii gend par wicketiper mahendra singh dhoni ne unka kaich lene main asafal rahe
 Injured bowler Ishant Sharma landed on the field this morning but he could not bowl in the first session due to spending long time outside
 isse dhoni ke paas kam vikalp ho gayi or unhen shuru main hi spinneron kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 To support Penn, Johnson showed a fiery attitude and scored five fours and three sixes in his 66-ball innings
 unhone pragyan ojha kii gend par do or harbhajan singh par ek chakka jadaa
 Johnson also completed 1000 runs in Test cricket before becoming Zaheer's fourth victim
 nathan haritz (9) adhik der nahin tik paye or harbhajan ne unhen pavilion bheja
 Wicket-keeper batsman Penn played the Indian spinners easily and hit the first half-century in Test cricket
 unhen shatak ke kareeb pahunchane par jeevandaan bhi mila lekin iske baavjood bhi vah tihare ank main nahin pahunch paye
 When Penn was on 86, Dhoni could not take his catch off Zaheer
 pen haalanki apana shatak puraa nahin kar paye or jahir kii gudleyngth gend unke balle ko chuumati hui duusari slip main vivies lakshmana ke paas pahunch gayi jinhone aage girte hue use kaich kar liya
 Penn played 196 balls and hit 12 fours in his innings of almost five hours
 jahir ne is tarah se dasvin baar pari main paanch yaa isse adhik wicket liye
 After that it was not too late for the Australian innings
 pen ke out hone ke baad agle over main ojha kii pehali gend par harbhajan ne ben hilphenhas (naabad 20) kaa kaich choda lekin chauthi gend par vah dag bolinger ko eshanth sharma ke haathon kaich karaane main safal rahe
 Former minister Kapil Mishra, who has been targeting Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for the past several days in Delhi's politics, may soon appear in BJP
 kendriya mantri vijay goyal ne ravivaar ko kejariwal sarkaar main purv mantri rahe kapil mishra kii tarif main kaside gadhe or unhen bijepi main aane kaa nyauta de daalaa
 In fact, these days the BJP is running a campaign called 'sampark for support', under which Union Minister Vijay Goel met Aam Aadmi Party MLA Kapil Mishra and counted the achievements of the Central Government for 4 years
 bataa den ki lambey samay se is baat ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki kapil mishra bijepi main shaamil ho sakate hai
 Mishra has been a constant attacker on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 goyal bole- kapil tay karen kab aana he BJP mesub jabaki bijepi netaa vijay goyal ne spasht kar diya he ki wo kapil mishra ko mahatvapurn maanate hai, to ye kapil ko tay karnaa he ki wo kab bijepi jwoin karte hai
 Goyal said that the doors of BJP are always open for Kapil Mishra and now Kapil has to decide when he comes to BJP? Goyal praised Kapil and said that Kapil is a worthy person and he has come to his house, which proves that he considers Kapil important
 duusari taraf kapil ne kaha ki jab mahabharat ke yuddh main kaurav ek hote hai, to pandavon ko bhi ek hona chahie
 Goyal said that bjp's eyes are on good people
 dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki jo log pradhanmantri modi ke sapanom or unki soch ke saath hai, un sabakaa bijepi main swaagat he
 Obviously, the way Kapil Mishra has been continuously attacking Arvind Kejriwal, the BJP is now going to be his enemy on those attacks
 soshal media par bijepi-kapil kii dosti kejariwal ke khilaaf ek dikhti thi, lekin ab jameen par bhi iskaa rang dikhne laga he

 dilli ke ladi shriram college kii chaatra gurmeher cor apane shahar jalandhar beshak laut chuki hai lekin unka naam lagaataar surkhiyon main bana hua he
 The martyr military officer's daughter Gurmehar expressed her views through placards, different opinions were expressed in the country
 ab wo chaahe abivipi se nahin darane kaa gurmeher kaa taaja placord ho yaa purana video jisamen gurmeher haath main kai placord lekar shanti kaa sandesh dete dikhaai detii hai
 In one of these it was also written - "pakistan did not kill my father, Jung killed me
" "gurmeher ko apni raay jataane ke liye soshal media par jahaan bahut kuch sunne ko mila
 Even alleged rape threats
 haalanki saath hi gurmeher kaa samarthan karne waalon kii bhi kami nahin rahi
 Amidst this entire controversy, India Today talked to Gurmehar's mother Rajwinder Kaur over the phone and wanted to know what a mother's heart wants to say when she sees a young daughter in this situation
 saath hi gurmeher kii parvarish ke dauraan kis tarah kii chunautiyon kaa unhen saamana karnaa padaa or kis tarah ke adarsh unhone sikhaye
 India Today - Want to know your thoughts and the way you raised Gurmehar, as well as the kind of ideals you taught him
 rajvinder cor-gurmeher kaa janm bangala sahib gurudwara main aradaas lagane ke baad hua, isliye uskaa naam gurmeher rakhaa gaya
 Gurmehar was precious to both of us husband and wife
 gurmeher ne bahut jaldi ek saal kii umr se hi bolnaa shuru kar diya tha
 In those days Gurmehar's father was posted in Kupwara
 gurmeher do saal kii hogi jab uske pita phone par baat karte the to wo 'vandemaataram' kahati thi
 Gurmehar's father used to call him gul-gul
 wo jab phone par kehete the gul-gul gaanaa sunaao to gurmeher gaati thi- soljar, soljar
 
 
 The heart took a mouse after speaking sweet things
 gurmeher chura kar nahin bol paati thi isliye chuha kahati thi
 After the martyrdom of Gurmehar's father, it was very difficult to convince the little girl that her father did not live in this world
 uske papa jab bhi ghar aate the to usase bahut laad karte the, isliye wo papa ko zyada miss karti thi
 She often asked when Mama, my father, would come
 un dinon serial aata tha-kyonki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi
 In it, a character named Mihir dies
 lekin serial main dikhaaya gaya tha ki mihir kuch maheene baad laut aata he
 Seeing this, Gurmehar started saying that my father would also come back
 ye wo samay tha jab maine sakht lahaze main gurmeher ko samajhaayaa ki papa kabhi waapas nahin aaenge, wo shahid ho gaye hai
 For a mother, explaining the death of a little girl was nothing less than a challenge
 india today-kuch logon ke aapaki beti ko 'desh-virdohi' kahana aapako aahat karata hoga
 What are your questions on the kind of questions that are being asked? Rajvinder Kaur - i know why she talks about peace
 wo is vednaa ko bheetar se mahasoos kar sakati he
 Because for a child his first hero is the father
 aap us bachche kii manosthiti samaj sakate he jab uskaa is asaliyat se saamana hota he ki pita duniya main nahin rahe
 When i took her to the pre-nursery school, she was accompanied by all the parents
 ye gurmeher bhi dekh rahi thi
 He held me tightly
 us vakt 15-20 minute tak meri ankhon main aansu rahe
 i kept thinking that when this is my condition, then what must have been happening on the small Gurmehar
 shahid kii patni hona aasaan nahin he
 Being a martyr's daughter is not easy
 agar wo (gurmeher) shanti kaa sandesh de rahi thi to isliye ki kisi or bachche ko is sab se naa guzarana pade
 Gurmehar is very emotional
 pichley saal usne sabhi ke liye shanti kaa paigaam bheja
 Gurmehar often had to hear from close relatives or relatives that his father was like this
 unhone ye kiya tha, wo kiya tha
 Negative thoughts should not come in the mind of a child
 kachi umr se hi maine use sahi tarah se guide kiya
 People in our country only understand simple things
 uske peeche kii gaharaai ko samajhane kii bhi koshish kii jaani chahie
 There are many more hidden behind every expression expressed
 gurmeher har cheez ke liye bahut sakaaratmak he
 Negative talk was kept away from her thinking, so in childhood, she was given a reading of 'anne Frank'
 'life ij beautiphul' jaisi filmein dikhaai
 Understands the consequences of a situation like Gurmehar war
 nakaaratmakataa se dur rakhane ke liye hi maine use samajhaayaa ki kisi khaas ne uske papa ko nahin balki yuddh ne maaraa
 The things that are being said on social media, being mocked, definitely hurt
 lekin ye sab asthaayee hai
 So it doesn't matter
 maine gurmeher ko yahi samajhaayaa ki ye sthiti hameshaa ke liye nahin rahane vaali
 we want peace
 agar tum shanti chaahate ho to tumhen in sab baton kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 India Today - How difficult the last 48 hours have been for you and how you, as a mother, are helping your daughter to face criticism
 rajvinder cor-eemaandaaree se kahuun to main zyada aahat hum par main apni beti se sikh rahi hum
 He is a very strong person
 majboot ladki he
 a friend of mine used to tell me that if anything happens to you then what will happen to your daughter
 ab main puri tarah aashwast hum ki agar mujhe kuch ho gaya to main jaanati hum ki meri beti bahut majboot he or acchhee tarah apana dhyaan rakhane main sakasham he
 India Today - This is a very strong message from a mother
 kya aap niraash hai ki 20 saal kii ladki kii raay par pratikriya dene ke liye cricketer, resler, ministar sabhi kud pade
 Rajwinder kaur-gurmehar himself is also a tennis player
 wo acchhee tarah samajhati he ki tennis player ek duusare ke saath kaise hameshaa majaak karte hai
 i don't mind it
 sahvaag varisht cricket khilaadi hai
 It is also the pride of this country
 main unki nishtha kaa sammaan karti hum ki wo jo ipel ho yaa desh ke liye cricket, sabhi jagah dikhaate the
 i also respect the Phogat sisters
 wo mahila shakti kii pratik hai
 i myself have two daughters
 unhone jo kaha wo desh ke liye apane prem kii vajah se kaha
 He understood that Gurmehar's expression is perhaps somewhat different
 gurmeher bhi desh se utana hi pyaar karti he
 This is the girl who started saying Vande Mataram instead of Hello on phone
 usne deshvirohi jaisaa kuch nahin kaha
 Like i said earlier he developed his logical thinking by watching movies like 'life is Beautiful'
 wo bahut padhati bhi he
 What she reads makes her feel inside
 india today-ye jaanakar acha laga ki sab kuch hone ke baad bhi aap itani sakaaratmak soch rakhti hai
 But one thing that is troubling the people is Gurmehar's statement that not Pakistan, but Jang killed his father
 ek maa ke naate apni beti ke is najariye par aapkaa kya kahana he
 Rajvinder Kaur - As i said earlier, only one of his lines was quoted
 gurmeharka makasad ek khaas ghatana kaa hawala dekar apni baat ko kahana tha
 She ran after a woman when she was younger
 tab use maa yani maine samajhaayaa tha ki pakistan ne uske pita ko nahin balki jang ne maaraa tha
 From a long perspective, Gurmehar wanted to explain what war is
 yuddh vinaash he
 In a situation in which people fight among themselves, countries fight among themselves
 main apni beti ke man main padosi desh kii aisi chhavi nahin banane dena chaahati thi ki jo usamen jehar bhare yaa bhavishya main shanti ke maukey ko avasar dene ke liye taiyaar naa ho
 It was just a part of the clippings
 usne ye nahin kaha ki aisa nahin hua
 He said that i took it positively and removed the feeling of hate from myself
 ye sab ke liye nahin tha
 No one should go after the statement
 wo ek ghatana ke hawaale se najariya saaf karne ke liye kaha gaya tha
 India Today- Last question are you afraid of daughter Gurmehar? What are you saying to Gurmehar? rajvinder cor-main dari nahin hui hum
 i am above Over Protective
 wo faujee kii beti he
 She is a brave girl
 wo apane faisle leti he
 He is not a coward, a courageous person

 Will not reconsider the 1995 Judgment
 vah ye tay karenge ki kya dharm ke naam par vot maange ja sakate hai? CJI TS Thakur said that after the 20-year-old verdict, the reference given by the five-judge bench to the Constitution Bench of seven judges, where is it written that the constitutional bench has to explain Hindutva? This is not mentioned in any part of the judgment
 jis baat kaa zikr hi nahin he
 
 usein ham kaise sun sakate hai? court philhal is badi bahes main nahin ja rahaa ki hindutv kya he or iskaa matlab kya he? During the hearing of the case, Chief Justice TS Thakur said that no candidate or any of his supporters can be allowed to ask for votes in the name of religion
 ye chunavi prakriya main sabase bady buraai he, kyonki dharm ke naam par log prabhavit hote hai
 Appeals to voters in any secular country should also be under the secular principle

 supreme court ne yah tippanee yachikakarta sundar laal patwa ke vakil kii daleel par kii thi jab kaha gaya ki supreme court ko 1995 ke jajment ko bane rahane dena chahie
 The Chief Justice said that if we look at the case of Patwa, he is from the Jain community and if someone asks him to help build the Ram temple despite being a Jain, then it is not the candidate but will have to ask for votes on the basis of religion
 sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court main chif justise ne kai bade sawaal bhi uthaae the :- Can a person from one community ask for votes on the basis of their religion from the people of their community? Does it fall under the category of corrupt conduct? Can a person from one community ask for votes of another community candidate from another community? Will it be corrupt practice for a religion guru to vote for someone else in the name of religion and Should the candidate's election be canceled? darasal, bharat main chunaav ke dauraan dharm, jati samudaay ityadi ke aadhaar par vot maangane yaa phir dharm guruon dwaara chunaav main kisi ko samarthan dekar dharm ke naam par vot daalane sambandhi taur tareeke kitne sahi or kitne galat hai ? ise lekar supreme court sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 At the same time, the Supreme Court, during the first hearing of the case, had refused to make the Central Government a party at present
 CJI thakur ne centre sarkaar ko maamle main party banane sambandhi maang ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki yah ek chunaav yachika kaa maamla he, joki sidhe chunaav ayog se judaa he
 In this, the central government cannot be made a party
 darasal 1995 ke faisale main supreme court ne kaha tha ki- 'hindutv' ke naam par vot maangane se kisi ummidavaar ko koi faaydaa nahin hota he
 At that time, the Supreme Court had given Hindutva a way and idea of living a 'way of Life'
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki hindutv bharatiyon kii jivan style kaa hissaa he or ise hindu dharm or aasthaa tak simit nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 The court said that seeking votes in the name of Hindutva is not a corrupt practice and it is not corruption under Section 123 of the Representation of People Act
 yachikakarta ke vakil ne riprogentation of piples act kii dhara-123 va iske anubhag 3 par karte hue kaha ki varna, dharm, jati, bhashaa or samudaay ke aadhaar par agar koi vyakti vot maangata he to ise chunaav ke galat tareekon kii sangya di jaati he
 If such a case is found, the entire election of the guilty person is canceled
 tippaniyan Significantly, in the 1992 Maharashtra assembly elections were held
 us samay vahaan ke netaa manohar joshi ne bayaan diya tha ki maharashtra ko ve pehla hindu rajya banaaenge
 There was a dispute and in 1995 the Bombay High Court quashed the said election
 phir yah maamla supreme court pahunchaa tha
 Later in the Supreme Court, a bench of Justice Jess s Verma ruled that Hindutva is a way of life, it could not be combined with Hinduism and overturned the judgment of the Bombay High Court
 2005 ke teen jajon ke faisle ko paanch jajon kii sanvaidhanik peeth ko bheja gaya
 After the Sunder Lal Patwa case came up in January 2014, the matter was referred to the Constitution Bench of seven judges
 CJI ties thakur ne kaha ki 20 saal puraane faisle ke baad 5 jajon kii bench ne jo reference saat jajon kii samvidhan peeth main bheja usamen yah baat kahaan likhi gai he ki sanvaidhanik peeth ko hindutv kii vyakhya kerani he? faisle ke kisi bhi hisse main is baat kaa zikr nahin he
 Which is not even mentioned
 
 How can we hear them? The court is not currently going into this big debate about what Hindutva is and what it means? is maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan chif justise ties thakur ne kaha ki kisi pratyaashee yaa uske kisi samarthak ko ye ijaajat nahin di ja sakati ki wo dharm ke naam par vot maange
 This is the biggest evil in the electoral process, because people are affected in the name of religion
 kisi bhi secular desh main matadaataaon ko kii jane vaali apil bhi secular siddhant ke tahat hi honi chahie
 The intention of promoting political activities by seeking votes on the basis of religion cannot be approved
 maamle kii sunwaayee buudhvaar ko bhi jari rahegi
 The Supreme Court commented on the application of social activist Teesta Setalvad, retired professor Shamsul Islam and journalist Dilip Mandal
 supreme court ne kaha ki is arji par baad main gaur kiya jayega
 The court has kept this petition pending
 darasal, saamaajik kaaryakarta tista sitalwad or kai anya logon ne supreme court main arji daakhil kar 20 saal puraane hindutv jajment ko palatney kii maang kii he
 The petition said that in the country for the last two and a half years, such an atmosphere is being created under the guise of these orders, due to which the minority, independent thinkers and others are feeling insecure
 aise main supreme court ko aise bhaashan dene waalon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kerani chahie, haalanki pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court main CJI thakur ne kaha tha :- Why not ask for votes on the basis of religion in an election as electoral fault? Electoral process is secular and no religion can be mixed in it
 Election and religion are two different things, they cannot be mixed together
 Can religion be included in any secular activity? For 20 years, Parliament has not made any law in this regard
 If the court what was waiting for the Supreme Court about the decision to have such sexual Susn case
 agali sunwaayee 25 aktubar ko hogi
 The Supreme Court made this remark on the plea of petitioner Sundar Lal Patwa's counsel when it was said that the Supreme Court should allow the 1995 Judgment to be upheld
 chif justise ne kaha ki patwa kaa cese hi dekhen to vah jain samudaay se hai or koi unke liye kahe ki vah jain hone ke baavjood ram mandir banane main madad karenge to ye pratyaashee nahin balki dharm ke aadhaar par vot maangana hoga
 During the hearing, many big questions were also raised by the Chief Justice in the Supreme Court: - kya koi ek samudaay kaa vyakti apane samudaay ke logon se apane dharm ke aadhaar par vot maang saktaa he? kya ye bhrasht aacharan kii shrenee main aata he ?kya ek samudaay kaa vyakti duusare samudaay ke pratyaashee ke liye apane samudaay ke logon se vot maang saktaa he?kya kisi dharm guru ke kisi duusare ke liye dharm ke naam par vot maangana bhrasht aacharan hoga or pratyaashee kaa chunaav radd kiya jaae? Actually, how right and how wrong are the methods of seeking votes on the basis of religion, caste community etc
 during elections in India or by religious gurus to vote in the name of religion by supporting someone in elections? The Supreme Court is hearing this
 vahiin, supreme court ne maamle kii pehali sunwaayee ke dauraan centre sarkaar ko philhal party banane se inkaar kar diya tha
 CJI Thakur rejected the demand of the Central Government to be a party in the case and said that it is a case of an election petition, which is directly related to the Election Commission
 isamen centre sarkaar ko party nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 In fact, in the 1995 verdict, the Supreme Court had said that seeking a vote in the name of 'hindutva' does not benefit a candidate
 ' us vakt supreme court ne hindutv ko 've of life' yani jivan jeene kaa ek tarika or vichaar bataaya tha
 The Supreme Court had said that Hindutva is part of the lifestyle of Indians and cannot be confined to Hinduism and faith
 court ne kaha tha ki hindutv ke naam par vot maangana karpt practice nahin he or riprogentation of pipul act kii dhara-123 ke tahat ye bhrashtachar nahin he
 Counsel for the petitioner while doing section-123 and section 3 of the Representation of People's Act said that if a person asks for votes on the basis of varna, religion, caste, language and community, then it is termed as wrong methods of election
 
 aisa maamla paae jane par doshi vyakti kaa puraa chunaav radd kar diya jaataa he
 The comments gauratlab he ki 1992 main maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav hue the
 At that time, its leader Manohar Joshi had given a statement that he would make Maharashtra the first Hindu state
 jis par vivaad hua tha or 1995 main bambe hoicourt ne ukt chunaav ko radd kar diya tha
 Then the matter reached the Supreme Court
 baad main supreme court main justise jes es verma kii bench ne faisla diya tha ki hindutv ek jivan style he, ise hindu dharm ke saath nahin joda ja saktaa or bombai hoicourt ke faisle ko palat diya tha
 The 2005 three-judge decision was referred to a five-judge constitutional bench
 janvari 2014 main sundar laal patwa kaa cese aane ke baad is maamle ko saat jajon kii samvidhan peeth ko bheja gaya
 During the hearing of the case, Chief Justice TS Thakur said that no candidate or any of his supporters can be allowed to ask for votes in the name of religion

 hawaaon main ''modi, modi" ke naare gunjane lagate hai, jab pradhanmantri apni jaani-pahachaani baaten doharaate hai—congress baantne kii siyasat kar rahi he, bhaajapa kii hukumat main vikaas ke aankade, bullate train kaa hohalla, bharuch jile ke sthaneey mudde
 Even trying to assuage the Muslims, the two districts that have seen the highest growth are Kutch and Bharuch, which have the largest Muslim population in Gujarat
 " saaf he ki chunaavon ke aakhri daur main modi kii apane chunavi bhaashanon par puri pakad kaayam he
 The important thing is that they never attack Hardik even by turning around
 usee hardik par, jo patelon ke liye aarakshan kii samarthak party pieees (paas) ke netaa hai or jinhen saurashtra se lekar uttar or madhya gujarat tak har jagah patelon ke bich mil rahi vaahvahee se bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ke seene par saanp lot rahe hai
 The task of firing the shells has been left to the leaders of the state like Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel
 nitin aagaah karte hai ki ''congress ke fande main mat funsana
 They are using hearty; More than 49 percent of reservations are impossible under the Constitution
 " bhaajapa kai morchon par musiibat jhel rahi he—patel aarakshan andolan ko sanbhaalane main gadabadi, moongfalee or kapaas kii banpar fasalon ke liye achche samarthan mulya kaa bharosa dilaane main rajya sarkaar kii naakaami
 In the case of Patels, this is a double whammy as a large part of the farmers also come from them
 phir jiesti ke aane se badlaav kaa asar to he hi
 And there is also the anti-incumbency that has built up over the last 20 years
 agar sabase badi chintaa matadaataaon ke ek hisse main bhaajapa kii ''taanaashaahee" (satta main hone kaa ghamand or hekdi) ko lekar paidaa hui naaraazgi he
 Blamed it for almost everything from manipulative manipulation against Hardik to the party's desperate attempts to defeat Congress leader Ahmed Patel in the recent Rajya Sabha elections and even to implement GST without consulting them
 Is going
 haalanki kai siyaasi vishleshak maanate hai ki modi main vah baat he jisase ve is gusse ko kaabo kar sakate hai
 Political analyst Vidyut Thakkar even goes on to say, "the support for the Congress is visible, it is only upper, and even if it is real, the party does not have the network to convert this support into votes
" " lekin thakkar ne saurashtra sareekhe un ilaakon kii jameen nahin naapi he, jahaan kai hisson main bhaajapa ke khilaaf gussa khul rahaa he
 Here Patel has been against the BJP in large numbers, while the obcs, whom the BJP has been trying to woo, are not listening to the extent that the party wants
 par nichali jatiyon main modi ke khaase mureed hai
 This is exactly the same as seen after demonetisation
 thakor samudaay ke centre mehsana jile ke bahucharaaji ke najdiki gaanv se aane vaale sanaji thakor ek nijee company main driver hai
 He belongs to the same OBC Kshatriya caste that the Congress has Alpesh
 sanaji kehete hai, ''yah chunaav modi jeetenge
 None of their collision
 ek vahi to hai jise garibon kii phikr he
 "election figures present an interesting picture
 2012 main bhaajapa ne 115 siten jiti thim or 47
 9 percent or about 1
 31 karod vot hasil kiye the, jabaki congress ne 38
 9 percent or 1
 06 karod ke aasapaas vot hasil kiye the—donon main 8
 There was a difference of 9 percent
 par bhaajapa ne jo 115 siten jiti thim, unamem se 15 par jeet kaa faasla 5,000 se bhi kam voton kaa tha
 23 seats were lost by an equal margin
 donon partiyaan inhen 38 siton par puri takat laga rahi hai
 Independents and candidates from smaller parties also played a major role in 2012 and 8
 11 fisadi yaa takreeban 22 lakh jitani baari taadaad main vot hasil kiye the
 Not only this, despite Modi's bluster campaign in 2012, the difference between the saffron party's victory in rural and semi-rural seats was small, as caste issues prevailed over development in those areas
 125 aisi siton par daale gaye voton main se congress ko bhaajapa se mahaj 3
 7 percent votes were received
 yahaan bhaajapa ke haq main jane vaali ek baat vijay roopaani sarkaar kii seva-sethu yojana kii kamyaabi hogi, jisamen rajkaaj ko 10 gaanvon kii sabase nichali ikai tak le jaaya gaya tha
 In this, the benefits of many public schemes were really given to the beneficiaries at their doorstep
 mahaj ek saal ke dauraan is yojana ke daayre main takreeban ek karod logon ko le aayaa gaya tha
 Yet Congress leader Himanshu Vyas says, "how can she win? No one will deny that 2017 is a very difficult task for the BJP compared to 2012
 tamaam paaramparik vot bank uske khilaaf ja chuke hai
 "this gives a glimpse of superstition in the Congress court, especially after it is known that Modi and Ustad strategist Amit Shah are present in the front
 patel voton ke nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye shah prajapati, luhaar or gurjar sareekhe chote obisi dhadon ko rijhaa rahe hai, jinka milakar rajya ke obisi voton main 52 fisadi kaa hissaa he
 The booth management strategy is Shah's main strength
 is hunar main congress kamjor he
 Shah has asked the state BJP to ensure that at least three members of the family of each party worker cast their votes before 12 noon
 bhaajapa un 7,50,000 ''voting pej prabhariyon" par bhi bharosa karke chal rahi he jo usne banaae hai
 There are more than 45,000 polling booths in Gujarat and the voter list of each booth is spread over 16 pages on an average
 votaron ke harek panne ke liye bhaajapa ne ek panna prabharee banaaya he, jo us panne par darj matadaataaon par apana puraa dhyaan lagayegaa
 This level of meticulous management is the technique in which Shah has mastered over time and has brought the BJP to a huge advantage in converting its shrinking support base into votes
 rajya congress pravaktaa manish doshi is sabko sire se khaarij kar dete hai
 He says, "anger against the government can sabotage any strategy
 " vahiin bhaajapa ke gujarat prabharee mahasachiv bhupendra yadav kehete hai, ''nirnaayak din booth prabandhan hi asal myne rakhata he
 One reason for this strength is our army of party workers committed to ideology
 " saaf he ki jeet kii lakeer ko paar karne ke liye bhaajapa ne apni ummiden star prachaarak pradhanmantri modi or unki jajbaati apilon ke alaava isi fouj par tikaa rakhi hai

 lekin kya ye naare lagane ke liye dusron ko majaboor karnaa sahi he?bijepi par hamalahatro ko sambodhit karte hue tharur ne bijepi ko jamkar khari-khoti sunai
 He said that this BJP cannot decide that who will not speak Bharat Mata ki Jai is not a nationalist
 wo shaks desh se pyaar nahin karata he
 Advocating changes in the law, Tharoor said that the charges of indignation were also leveled against the great men of the country, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Jawaharlal Nehru
 saaf shabdon main kahen to tharur ne deshadroh kanoon ke maujuuda swaroop ko khatm karne kii vakaalat kii
 Tharoor further said that people should have the right to elect so that they can live in democracy with their thoughts and ideas
 unhone kareeb 40 minute tak jeenyu main chaatro ko sambodhit kiya
