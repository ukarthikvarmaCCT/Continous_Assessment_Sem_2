 Indian correspondents in Beijing asked the Foreign Ministry of China many questions in this regard, but no answer has been received

 On the news of some EVM disturbances in the election, Krishnamurthy said that machines are not wrong, there are people who do wrong

 rajya ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki jis tareeke se yah baadh ai he isse kisi ko bhi sanbhalane kaa mauka nahin mila paaya he
 Also said that we have to rethink disaster management
 chunki baadh itani teji se ai kii ham peediton tak pahunch nahin paae

 We have only sought help from the Center for relief and rescue, have not asked for money yet
 saath hi bataaya ki kendra sarkaar se har tarah kii madad milegi

 argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ko chaara ghotaale ke tisare maamle main bhi doshi qaraar diya gaya or unhen 5 saal kii sajaa suna di gai
 It is obvious that Lalu was sentenced and there is a wave of happiness in JDU and camp
 jadyu ke netaa jahaan court ke faisle kaa swaagat kar rahe hai vahiin kuch netaa apni pratikriya kuch anokhe andaaj main de rahe hai
 Neeraj Kumar, jd-u's senior spokesperson, did not react heavily to Lalu's conviction and declaration of sentence, but attacked him only through a 6-line poem
 “ pyaas to mar kar bhi nahin bujhati jamaane kii,murde bhi jate-jate gangaajal kaa ghunt maangate hai,ab to tisare maamle main bhi sajaa tay he,aise main ab guhaar lagane se kya phayda ?kerani kaa fal to bhogana hi padegaa,ab gangaajal pine se bhi raajnneeti main moksh nahin milane vaala”agar niraj kumaar ne is kavita ke jariye lalu ke sajaa par apnipratikriyadi to vahi duusari taraf jadyu ke ek or pravaktaa sanjay singh ne twitor ke jariye lalu par tippanee karte hue kaha ki lagata he lalu ko ranchi ke birsa munda jail kii suvidhaayen itani bha gai he ki unhone ab vahaan par 5 saal rahane kaa faisla kar liya he
 Sanjay Singh said that Lalu Prasad is visiting inmates of Jharkhand jail and 3
 5 saal ke liye vahaan gaye the magar ab suvidhaayen itani pasand aa gai he ki ab 5 saal rahane kaa man bana liya he
 Sanjay Singh further said that the idiom of Bharani as per the above Lalu fits perfectly
 jadyu pravaktaa ne kaha ki lalu ne jo bhrashtachar kii gangotri bahaai he uski unhen sajaa mil rahi he
 Sanjay Singh said that Lalu has been punished only in three cases and the same is going to happen in the remaining two cases
 purv upmukhyamantri or argedy netaa tejasvi yadav par tanj kasate hue sanjay singh ne kaha ki agar tejasvi kii najar main lalu jaisaa bhrashtachari netaa hero he to aise main samajha ja saktaa he ki tejasvi kii rajnatik samaj kitni he
 Sanjay Singh said that for Tejashwi Yadav, Lalu Prasad is that hot potato which cannot be left and cannot be boiled

 Talking to NDTV, Anna Hazare said that even if he is invited by the government, he is still ready to negotiate with the government to agree on the Lokpal bill
 anna ne yah bhi kaha ki kal sansad main lokapal par jo sthaayee samiti kii report pesh kii gai he, vah hamaara janalokapal nahin
 At the same time, he said that every major political party has sent a reply to his call to put his views on the platform, although the Congress may not come to this stage, because his intention regarding a strong Lokpal bill is not clear yet
 anna ne chetaya he ki is baar kaa virodh pichhali baar se bhi bade paimaane par hoga
 He claimed that he is fully fit and ready for the long fast
 chutki lete hue unhone kaha ki yah to unke chehre ke tej se hi jaahir ho gaya hoga
 Earlier, before leaving for Delhi, Hazare said in Ralegan Siddhi, many martyrs had sacrificed their lives for our freedom, but we are still not able to feel free

 What is freedom bhrashtachar or lut aaj bhi he
 The whites left and the blacks arrived
 sirf yahi antar he
 He said, the second war of independence has started
 yah lambii ladaai he or bhrashtachar ko mitaane tak jari rahegi
 Many people will have to go to jail, eat lathis and some have to be sacrificed
 yah vakt ab aa gaya he
 Until we make sacrifices, true freedom will not be found

 Just as an alcoholic becomes unconscious, this government has become unconscious

 This is just a day's fast

 Today i am feeling energetic after seeing you guys

 anna ne congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa he
 He said that the proposal of the Standing Committee has been prepared under pressure from Rahul
 unhone sarkaar ko chetavanee bhare lahaze main kaha ki agar is satr main majboot lokapal vidheyak paarit nahin hua, to vah 27 disambar se ramlila maidan main anischitkaaleen samay ke liye anshan par baith jaaenge or uttar pradesh sahit un sabhi paanch rajyon main sarkaar ke khilaaf prachaar karenge, jahaan agle saal vidhansabha chunaav ho rahe hai

 Najib Razak said at the press conference that investigators suspected the plane was taken to the kazakhstan-turkmenistan corridor or the indonesia-south Indian Ocean corridor
 rajaak ne kaha ki haalanki media main khabaren hai ki vimaan kaa apharan kiya gaya, lekin ham ab bhi sabhi konon se jaanch kar rahe hai, chaalak dal or yatriyon par dhyaan kendrit kar rahe hai

 Advocate Rajeev Dhawan, who is assisting the apex court as a judge, quoted an interview by Home Minister p Chidambaram in which he himself said that it was decided that Ramdev would be taken out of the city if he agitated

 After assuming the responsibility of the post of Congress President, the biggest challenge is facing Rahul Gandhi
 12 may kii taarikh karnataka vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye tay kii gai he
 Karnataka is the largest state in a select few Congress-ruled states
 in chunaavon ke baad 2019 ke aam chunaavon kaa bigul bajegaa lihaaja rahul gandhi ke saamne aam chunaavon se pehle karnataka main congress ke is majboot kile ko bachaane kii badi chunauti he
 It seems from this that Rahul Gandhi has visited Karnataka four times in the last two months
 apane karnataka daure par rahul gandhi road sho kar rahe hai, college or univarsity main chaatro se mil rahe hai, kaarobaari jagat se rubaru ho rahe hai or party ke padaadhikariyon kii baithak ke saath-saath youth brigade ko bhi apana samay de rahe hai
 It is clear from Rahul Gandhi's statements in all these meetings that on the pretext of these assembly elections, he has the Modi government at the center and he will clear the BJP in Karnataka once again and clear the way for a tough challenge before the Modi government in 2019
 karnataka main kaarobaariyon se baat karte hue rahul gandhi ne modi sarkaar kii aarthik nitiyon ko chunauti di he
 Rahul has claimed that the NDA government has completely failed in generating job resources in the country
 haalanki rahul ne mana ki upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal main bhi nai naukari paidaa karne kii raftaar behad sust thi lekin unke mutabik modi sarkaar ne is kshetra main vifaltaa ke sabhi record tod die hai
 Along with these issues, what Rahul raised during his visit to Karnataka: Jumla proved to be worth millions of jobs
 Wadrahul Gandhi said that while neighboring country China is creating 50,000 jobs a day, Modi government only 400 jobs a day
 He is only able to give
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ne aise samay main kaarybhaar sambhala jab aarthik growth ke hisaab se bhartiya arthvyavastha behad majboot thi lihaaja aise samay main bhi nai naukari paidaa na kar paanaa sarkaar kii vifaltaa ko or gambhir kar detii he
 Read this: Karnataka's political arithmetic: congress-bjp direct competition or hung? Sangh takes economic decisions? Rahul Gandhi claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is dependent on organizations like RSS for his economic decisions and the country has to bear the brunt of this

 Rahul claimed that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had spoken to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on behalf of the Congress party before the implementation of GST
 is baatcheet main manmohan singh ne jetali se jiesti lagu karne se pehle ek payalat project chalaane kii baat kahi thi jisase nae tex niyamon ko parkhaa ja sake
 But Jaitley responded by ignoring the suggestion of former Prime Minister and Economist Singh that Prime Minister Modi has decided to implement GST
 2019 main congress sarkaar to badalegaa jiesti?rahul ne kaha ki congress chaahati thi ki puure desh main sirf 18 fisadi ke tex ke saath ek tear jiesti lagu kiya jaae or aam aadmi ke jarurat ke zyaadaatar utpaadon par shunya jiesti lagaaya jaae
 But Modi government made it very difficult to do business in the country by applying 5 tier GST
 rahul ne kaarobaariyon se vaada kiya ki yadi 2019 main kendra kii satta main congress vaapasi karti he to vah jiesti ko durust karne ke liye kade faisle le sakati he
 Modi's foreign policy failed? Rahul Gandhi termed the Modi government's foreign policy as a failure and said that at present, the country's relationship with all the neighboring countries has deteriorated
 jabaki sarkaar ko chahie tha ki vah vaishvik str par khud ko or majboot karne ke liye padosi deshon ke saath rishton ko saamaanya karne kii koshish kare
 The result is in front of us today
 china ne desh ke sabhi padosi mulkon se khaas rishta banane main safalataa pai he
 Rahul said that the government's failure is also gauged from the fact that a country like Russia which has always been India's closest friend is also being successful in building a strong relationship with Pakistan today
 kyon kamjor kiya raksha bajet?kendra sarkaar ke raksha bajet par rahul ne kaha ki aaj america samet china or rus jaise desh raksha bajet ko doguna or teen guna kar rahe hai
 He is taking this step in view of the international situation
 lekin bharat ne antarrashtriya maahaul se anbhigyata jaahir karte hue apane raksha bajet ko majboot karne kaa kaam nahin kiya he

 This does not mean that he does not want to become Prime Minister

 Singh said, "he just said that he would like to work for the party and would pay more attention to the issues affecting the country

 a picture embarrassing humanity has come to light in Madhya Pradesh where due to negligence of the system, a man had to walk with the body of his grandson for half a kilometer
 iske baad thak haar kar wo god main pote kaa shav rakhkar ek maidan main baith gaye
 People saw this person on the way, but due to the body being completely wrapped in cloth, no one could understand the whole matter
 karant lagane se hui 10 saal ke bachche kii mautamaamla khargon jile ke adivasee anchal segaanv kaa he
 After the 10-year-old Mahesh died of electrocution at Chulipura of the police post, the family members, including the deceased's grandfather, had to suffer for hours to take the dead body to their village
 mahesh ko gaanv main bijli ke khambhe se karant laga tha
 The boy was brought to the government hospital in Block Segaon from the village in critical condition
 jahaan doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 After the post-mortem, Mahesh was handed over to the family of Kashvaras
 doctoron ne jhaada pallamazdooree karke parivaar kaa pet paalane vaale sukhlal adivasee ke paas apane bete kaa shav 30 kimi dur apane gaanv chhipipura le jane ke paise nahin the
 He along with his elder brother Gulsing and a family Dilip sought help from the doctors at Segaon Hospital but the doctors brushed off saying that there is a vehicle arrangement to bring the sick to the hospital but we have a vehicle to take the body home or village Is not
 sthaneey logon ne kiya shav vaahan kaa intjamdoctoron kii baat sunakar mahesh ke dada shawl main pote kaa shav lapetakar aspataal parisar main ghanton ghoomte rahe lekin koi madad nahin mili
 Later, he lifted the body in his lap and walked towards the village on foot
 kareeb aadha kimi paidal chalane ke baad sadak ke kinare maidan par apane pote kaa shav haath main rakhkar wo baith gaye
 When the locals came to know, they arranged for the carcass
 sthaneey logon or police kii madad se garib adivasee parivaar apane bete kaa shav gaanv le ja sakaa
 There are around 5 vehicles from various social organizations at the district headquarters, yet the block medical officer of Segaon did not make any arrangements for the vehicle while Segaon is just 30 km from the district headquarters
 kanfederation of ol india treders yani sieaiti kaa daawa he ki soshal media kii boycott china products kii muhim ne apana asar bazaar par dikhaanaa shuru kar diya he
 This effect is quite tremendous
 halaat ye he ki naa sirf dilli ensiaar balki puure desh main treders bhram kii sthiti main hai ki china se saamaan aayaat kiya jaae yaa nahin yaa phir aayaat kiye gaye saamaan ko custom se chhudaaya jaae yaa nahin
 If you follow the market signals, then this Diwali made in China products business can be reduced by up to 30%
 cat ke mahasachiv praveen khandelwal kaa kahana he ki soshal media parchinis saamanonke khilaaf jo muhim chhedi gai he, usase mote taur par china ko koi nuksaan nahin hoga
 At least not this season at all
 isaki vajah ye he ki diwali ke maukey par kharidari kii taiyaari tryder 2-3 maheene pehle hi shuru kar detaa he
 So almost all the wholesale dealers' shops and warehouses are lined with Chinese goods
 aisi sthiti main yadi kisi kaa nuksaan hoga, to wo hamaare desh ke hi log or vyapaaree honge
 At the same time, there is such a strong opposition among Chinese consumers that they are not ready to buy Chinese goods at any cost
 iskaa asar christmas or nae saal ke dauraan hone vaale aayaat par pad saktaa he
 India is a big market for China, India is a big market for China, which is not possible for the dragon to ignore
 vahiin, lagaataar aayaat ke maddenjar bharat main khilone, furniture, hardware, pataakhe, liting or electric saamaanon, gift item, ghadiyaan or kichan applience kii manufaccharing itani pichad chuki he ki wo demand kii supplai kar paane main philhal naakaam hi hogi
 Government should strengthen manufacturing In such a situation, if there is an option to prepare Chinese goods, then the government will have to take long-term decisions
 hamen apnimanufaccharingmajboot kerani hogi or ye sarkari sahaayta ke bina nahin ho saktaa
 National President of CAT, BC Bhartia, said that along with financial support, the government will have to provide new technology to small and medium enterprises at a cheaper rate
 tabhi bharat kaa nirmaan udyog hamaari apni maang kii aapurti karne laayak taiyaar ho paaegaa
 It is not a far-fetched competition against China; it is far from a far-fetched competition against China at the international level in terms of construction, but if the government gets the help and support it needs, then there can be no doubt that soon Only the country can prepare for China's competition at international level

 saal 2006 main ai film "umrao jaan" bhale hi 1981 main ai rekha kii "umrao jaan" ke mukaable box offis par khaas dhamal nahin machaa saki thi
 But the beauty of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the film was appreciated by everyone
 najaakat, nafasat ke shandaar mail ne is film ko charchit bana diya tha
 Although Aishwarya was not the first choice of director JP Datti for the film
 ye baat kam log hi jaanate hai
 According to a report by Bollywood Life, making the film was JP Dutti's dream
 isamen sabase zyada umrao jaan kaa kirdaar ahm tha
 To bring this character on screen, JP Dutta first approached Miss World Priyanka Chopra
 lekin priyanka dats nahin de pain
 After this, Aishwarya's second name came in JP Dutta's mind
 aishwarya ne film main abhishek bachchan ke saath kaam kiya
 This film was definitely in the discussion, but it could not show anything amazing at the box office
 priyanka ko film chhodane kaa afsos tab tak jarur rahaa jab tak ye relies nahin hui thi
 After releasing the film, he certainly would not have felt sorry for the film
 aajkal box offis par jepi datta ke haal bure hai
 Audiences are denying his films one by one

 Safety and self-respect comes first and rules are followed
 haal hi main chif secretary ke saath jo bartaav hua, usase adhikariyon kaa manobal gira he
 At the same time, reacting to the allegations of the IAS Association, Delhi Environment Minister Imran Hussain said, 'IAS officers are lying

 Implement plans that have stalled

 According to the association, women IAS officers demand security to attend the meeting
 lekin ham meeting kii gopneeyata ko dekhte hue surakshaguard ke saath nahin ja sakate hai
 The IAS Association said that having a camera in the meeting cannot guarantee security, there is a need to change thinking and behavior

 Chief Minister ensure our safety, this is our prayer

 australia ke maaikel nobs ko bhartiya hockey team ke kharaab pradarshan ke kaaran mukhya coach ke pad se achaanak barkhaast kar diya gaya he
 He is the fourth foreign coach to be fired without completing his term
 hockey india ke mahasachiv narinder batra ne kaha ki nobs kaa anubandh radd kar diya gaya he or philhal vah ek maheene ke notice period par he
 High performance manager of Indian hockey, Rolant Oltmens, has been given the charge of the team until the appointment of a new coach
 batra ne daawa kiya ki nobs ne khud pad chhodane kaa faisla kiya tha kyonki unhen laga ki vah pad ke saath nyaay nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Batra said, 'he himself offered to step down in a meeting with Rolant Oltmens
 unki koching style ko lekar kuch pareshaaniyaan thi
 Altmens believed that he was not doing well in many areas and that Nobbs was not able to improve them
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘hamane saai ko suchit kar diya he ki ham unki sevaaon or nahin lenaa chaahate
 For the time being, Altmens will have the additional responsibility of the men's team
 vah nayaa coach niyukt hone par team ke prabharee honge or is prakriya main do teen maheene lag jaayenge
 Jizi Thomson, Director General of the Sports Authority of India, said that Nobbs' agreement was canceled yesterday and he has been given a month's notice
 thamsan ne kaha, ‘nobs ke anubandh main ek praavdhaan tha ki ham ek maheene kaa notice dekar unki sevaayen lenaa band kar sakate hai
 We have informed them and have also given one month's notice
 ’ thamsan ne kaha ki saai ne hockey india kii sifarish par nobs kii sevaayen aage nahin lene kaa faisla kiya he
 He said, 'hockey India told us that Nobbs has refused to continue in the post due to poor performance
 chunki nobs saai ke vetanman par hai to hamane aakhri faisla liya
 Nobbs, who assumed office two years ago, was given five years at a steep salary but could remain attached to the Indian hockey for only two years
 nobs se pehle spain ke jose brasa, australia ke rik charlsworth or germany ke gerard raak bharat ke coach rah chuke hai lekin unki vidaai bhi vivaadaaspad rahi
 The only achievement of Nobbs' tenure was India's qualification for the London Olympics as India was eliminated from the Beijing (2008) Olympics
 uske baad se team ke pradarshan main koi sudhaar nahin aayaa or landan olympic main aath baar kii champion team ek bhi match nahin jeet saki
 After India's sixth-placed FIH World League semi-final in Rotterdam last month, Nobbs' departure was almost certain to be considered
 bharat holland ke hegg main hone vaale vishwa cap kaa kota vahaan se hasil nahin kar sakaa
 Batra said it is no use to retain a coach who lacks dedication and motivation
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen laga ki unamem ab koi prerana nahin bachi he
 a national team coach cannot be a person who lacks dedication and motivation
 donon pakshon ko laga ki ab aage badhane kaa samay he
 He said that Nobbs is currently in Australia and on his return next week, Hockey India will give him a respectful farewell
 unhone kaha, ‘vah philhal austrailia main he
 He will return on 14 July
 ham unhen sammanjanak vidaai denge
 Meanwhile, the Sai DG said that he had received Hockey India's recommendation to appoint MK Kaushik as coach and it would take a week to take a final decision
 unhone kaha, ‘kowshik ke liye sifarish hamen mili
 We have no objection to appointing him but we have to get approval from the Sports Ministry
 ham khel mantralay ko unki file bhejenge or manjuur hone par ek saptaah main unki niyukti tay ho jaayegi
 'changing the coach is not the solution to the problem: Amid the dismissal of the head coach Michael Nobbs due to poor performance of Indian hockey team, former national coach Harendra Singh has said that changing the coach repeatedly is not the solution to the problem and now Roland Oltmens And MK Kaushik should be given the command of the team till the 2016 Olympics
 harendra ne kaha, ‘bhartiya haaki main koching kaa ek pattern hona chaiye
 Removing the coach or support staff after a bad series is not going to solve it

" mujhe lagata he ki main acchhee ballebaazi kar rahaa hum
 In the last Test, i was just out after playing a bad shot, but the team played good cricket, i am happy
 " Pujara says that new coach Anil Kumble is also satisfied with his batting
 haalanki unhone pujaara ko kya salaah di he ye to unhone nahin bataaya, magar pujaara duusare test match se pehle nets main abhyaas karne kaa koi mauka nahin chook rahe
 He also comes to the field to bat on the day of the practice
 tippaniyan According to Cheteshwar Pujara, "things are simple, i have to bat with more responsibility
 mujhe zyada chintaa kerani kii zarurat nahin he or naa hi ye sochane kii, ki mere bare main kya kaha ja rahaa he
 i have spoken to Kumble, which i cannot tell you, he is happy with my batting "
 pujaara beshak nishcint nazar aa rahe hai, lekin antiga kii tarah agar jamaica main bhi unka balla nahin bolaa, to captain kohli isse kitni khus honge ye kahana mushkil he
 Pujara should remember that a batsman like KL Rahul is sitting on the bench who is the captain's choice and is proving himself at every opportunity
 pujaara kaa kahana he ki nae coach anil kumble bhi unki ballebaazi se santusht hai
 Although he did not say what he advised Pujara, Pujara missed no opportunity to practice in the nets before the second Test
 wo opshnal practice ke din bhi ballebaazi karne maidan par aate hai
 The comments cheteshwar pujaara ke mutabik "chize saral he, mujhe or zimmedaari ke saath ballebaazi kerani he
 i do not have to worry too much nor think about what is being said about me
 kumble se mere baat hu he jo main aapako nahin bataa saktaa, wo meri ballebaazi se khush hai"
 Pujara seems restless, but if he does not speak in Jamaica like Antiga, it is difficult to say how happy Captain Kohli will be
 pujaara ko yaad rakhana chahie ki keel rahul jaisaa ballebaaz bainch par baitha he jo captain kii pasand he or har maukey par apane aap ko sabit kar rahaa he
 According to Cheteshwar Pujara, "things are simple, i have to bat with more responsibility
 mujhe zyada chintaa kerani kii zarurat nahin he or naa hi ye sochane kii, ki mere bare main kya kaha ja rahaa he

 To tackle crime against women, 3000 women will be recruited in Delhi Police next year to strengthen the capital's police force
 mahilaon se jude samvedansheel maamalon se nipatane ke liye adhikari or consteble donon padon par mahilaon kii bhartee kii jaaegi or rajdhani ke sabhi 166 police thanon main unki tainaati kii jaaegi
 a Home Ministry official said that the recruitment of women is going on
 iske baad unhen prashikshan diya jayega
 She is expected to join the Delhi Police by the end of next year
 dilli police kaa prashasnic niyantran grih mantralay ke antargat aata he
 All these posts were cleared after the gang rape of a young woman on December 16, 2012 in the capital
 us samay ghoshit yojana ke tahat, rajdhani ke har police thane main kam se kam do mahila sab-inspector or saat mahila constablon kii tainaati kii jaaegi
 Delhi Police is recruiting women in a special operation
 dilli police main lagbhag 80,000 karmi hai jisamen se lagbhag 7,000 mahilaayein hai
 The Justice JS Verma Committee and the Justice Usha Mehra Commission, formed after the December 16 incident, had suggested several measures for reform of laws and policing
 unhone dilli police main mahila ghatak ko majboot karne kaa bhi suzav diya tha
 The official said that the women workers will be imparted training by judges, lawyers and other experts as well as ngos
 chachaa ne bhrashtachar ke bare main kuch poocha to champu ne jawaab diya, bhrashtachar kisi lokapal dwaara thikaane nahin lagegaa, majboot antarlokapal dwaara hi parrast hoga
 Now what good is this atlokpal to yah bataaenge mashhoor kavi or lekhak ashok chakradhar
 He has recently written a book, 'champu's Inhalokpal'
 vaani prakaashan se chhapi is kitaab kaa buudhvaar ko nai dilli ke oxford book store main locarpan kiya jayega
 During this, Ashok Chakradhar will also talk to the readers
 kaarykram shaam 6 baje se shuru hoga
 There may be times about the book that Champu asks Chacha for his answers only
 ek pathak ne mujhase kaha tha ki lagata he chachaa bhi aap hai or champoo bhi aap hi hai
 i did not resist
 unase kaha, ek aadmi ek hi tarah se soche, jaruri nahin he, ho saktaa he ki us ek aadmi ke andar do aadmi hon
 Thinking differently
 ham samajhate hai ki ham apane soch ke swaroop ko jaanate hai, aisa he nahin
 Sometimes it also happens that what we know, we think we do not know
 hamaare abhyantar or bahirjagat main satat ek dwandv rahata he
 Muktibodh says that our consciousness coordinates between these two
 chachaa or champoo main se koi ek baahar kii duniya kii baat karata he or doosraa antarmanthan ke baad bolta he
 However, the year 2000 has been dedicated to corruption inside and outside
 chachaa ne bhrashtachar ke bare main kuch poocha to champoo ne jawaab diya, bhrashtachar kisi lokapal dwaara thikaane nahin lagegaa, majboot antarlokapal dwaara hi parrast hoga
 We should filter the outside universe and do not look at the world inside us, how will there be scandal, how will this happen? Where will the Lokpal sitting outside get the cameras installed
 mari hui aatma ke log kehete rahenge, itte hamaare, itte tumhaare, kya kar lenge anna hajaare? khaane vaale khaaenge icecream, kya kar legi badboli team? donon maanate hai ki bhrashtachar mitaane ke liye baahar bithaae gaye lokapal kii tulana main andar bithaaya hua antarlokapal zyada majboot siddh hoga
 Now only time will tell what will happen next
 sabhi loktantric shaktiyaan ek baar janata ke man main yah dharna bithaaen ki ve lokapal bill kii samarthak hai
 Now that lokpal-vidhan will prove to be the ghost of democracy or strong, it will depend on its followers and practitioners
 rah-rah kar mujhe baba sahab ambedkar kii baat yaad aati he, unhone kaha tha ki koi samvidhan kitna hi achche se acha kyon na bane, agar uskaa paalan karne vaale log achche nahin hai to us samvidhan kaa laabh na uthaa paaenge
 And no matter how weak a constitution is, if its runners are good then it can also be beneficial
 isi tarah se lokapal bill he, kamjor banaao yaa majboot, agar uskaa anupaalan karne vaale sahi hai, unki niyat main mattha yaa dahi nahin he, to desh thik hoga
 It is a terrible mistake to think that a strong Lokpal, a strong and a strong Lokpal will end corruption
 upar se laayaa gaya, kanoon dwaara banaaya gaya, sansad ke vaad-vivaad, bahason ke baad paarit kiya hua koi bhi lokapal bill or koi bhi lokapal yaa janatantr kaa thokapaal is desh main bhrashtachar kaa samul naash kar nahin saktaa

 The citizenship law will be introduced in the Lok Sabha today
 In the northeast, many organizations called in protest, the Union Home Minister Amit Shah will present the Modi government in the winter session of the Parliament
 a new law is going to be introduced
 naagarikta sanshodhan bill, 2019 ko kendriya grih mantri amit shah aaj loksabhaa main pesh karenge
 Opposition parties are strongly opposing this bill, besides many organizations are opposing it
 modi sarkaar ke nae kanoon kaa sabase zyada virodh purvottar main ho rahaa he, log sadakon par utar kar centre sarkaar ke khilaaf hallaa bol rahe hai
 Only in Assam, 16 organizations have called a 12-hour bandh on Monday to protest against this bill
 inke alaava adivasee chaatro ne bhi is band kaa samarthan kiya he, assam ke alaava anya rajyon main bhi bill ke khilaaf pradarshan chal rahaa he
 Before the citizenship law, NRC was also strongly opposed
 naagarikta bill se judi puri kawarej, yahaan clic kar padhein
 
 
 Why are the people of the Northeast protesting? The citizenship amendment bill that the central government is bringing is to be implemented in the entire country
 lekin iskaa sarvaadhik virodh assam, arunachal pradesh, mizoram, meghalaya samet purvottar ke rajyon main ho rahaa he
 In fact, most hindu-muslim people from Bangladesh who cross this border and settle in these states only
 ab agar nae kanoon ke tahat baahar se aae hindu logon ko naagarikta mil jaaegi, to vah vahaan par sadaa ke liye bas jaaenge
 This will also have a direct impact on the vote bank
 iske alaava sthaneey nagarikon ne ise purvottar kii bhashaai, saanskrithik asmita ke liye khatra bataaya he
 Not only in the Northeast but also in Bengal, Mamta Banerjee has associated it with Bengali identity
 haalanki, virodh ko dekhte hue arunachal pradesh, nagaland or mizoram ke inner line permit aria ko is bill se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 In addition, the bill also defends the sixth schedule of the North East
 naagarikta kanoon par vivaad kyon? pehle kya tha or ab kya? 10 point main samajhencchhabh kaa enarasi se he sambandh?darasal, purvottar ke logon ke dwaara is bill kaa virodh karne kaa ek kaaran or bhi he
 Because NRC is implemented in Assam and it is being implemented nationwide
 iske jariye adhiktar log jo desh se baahar ho rahe hai, vah muslim hai
 And on the other hand, people who get citizenship due to CAB will also be non-muslim, which is why local parties are protesting strongly
 bataa den ki nae bill ke tahat afghanistan, bangladesh, pakistan se aae gaiyr-muslim sharnaarthiyon ko bhartiya naagarikta milane main aasaani hogi
 Whereas Muslims are not included in the rule of citizenship

 The news about Geeta alias Hira came from Karachi, then the family recognized her in Saharsa, Bihar
 parivaar ne bataaya ki gita saharsa se ludhiana gai thi or uske baad vahaan se badakismati ne use sarhad paar pahunchaa diya
 When Saharsa's diamond accidentally entered the Pakistan border, they got her new name 'geeta'
 saharsa main rahane vaale janardan mahato kaa daawa he ki gita unki beti he or uskaa asli naam hira he
 What could never be said about Geeta's words has come to the world through pictures
 karachi main rahane vaali gita urf hira ne sabko pahchaan liya he
 The eyes that used to shed tears in the memory of the family till yesterday, those eyes now have the glow to return to their loved ones
 saharsa se jab parivaar ne gita urf hira ke liye tasviren bhejin, to usne ek hi lamhe main sabakuch ishaaron or nigahon ke jariye bayaan karnaa shuru kar diya
 Seeing the report, the father recognized the identifier on seeing the TV and newspapers
 pita ko aaj bhi apni hira yani gita kii ek-ek baat or ek-ek nishaani yaad he
 The whole family is waiting for Geeta to return to her country
 ludhiana se galati se pakistan gai gitagita kaa parivaar bihar ke saharsa or ludhiana main rahata he
 He has a ancestral home in Saharsa and his family laborers in Ludhiana
 ludhiana se hi gita ke pakistan jane kaa anchaaha rasta ban gaya tha
 According to the family, Geeta was married in Jalandhar in 2004
 2005 main gita urf hira ko ek betaa hua tha
 In 2005 Geeta went to her in-laws
 jalandhar ke kartarpur main malli gaanv main baisakhi kaa mela laga tha
 Geeta also went to the fair and disappeared from there
 parivaaravaalon ko kuch dinon baad gita urf hira ke laapata hone kii khabar mili
 The in-laws handed over Geeta's son to her parents
 kai saal tak parivaar ke log gita urf hira ko talashte rahe
 The family had also registered Geetha's disappearance at the police station
 magar uske bare main koi khabar nahin mil saki
 In August this year, news of Geeta appeared in newspapers and TV
 parivaar ke logon ne use pahchaan liya
 With the help of the Edi Foundation, the diamond, which entered the border of Pakistan, was sent to the Edi Foundation NGO in Karachi
 vahaan edi foundation kii sanchaalak bilakis edi ne use gita naam diya
 However, Geeta found family love at the Edi Foundation
 gita ko yah yakeen ho chalaa he ki ab vah kareeb das saal baad phir apane parivaar ke bich pahunch sakegi
 With the face and gestures, she tells her disquiet to get her loved ones
 wo bhale hi bol nahin sakati, lekin jahaan use itane saalon tak panaah mili, wo un logon ko bhi hameshaa yaad rakhane kaa vaada karti he
