 Former Rashtriya Janata Dal MP and Jan Adhikar Party President Pappu Yadav has alleged that the humiliation of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been done by RJD President Lalu Yadav for the last few days
 yahi nahin, unhone shahabuddin kii jamaanat ko chunauti dene kaa kharch uthaane kii bhi ghoshnaa kii he
 Shahabuddin, Raghuvansh, Taslimuddin's statement, be it Lalu's statement that Pappu Yadav had won the 2014 Lok Sabha elections on RJD ticket
 lekin baad main unhen party virdohi gatividhiyon kii vajah se party se nikaal diya gaya tha
 Pappu Yadav said that Jeshibhabuddin, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Taslimuddin from RJD are repeatedly insulting Nitish Kumar with their statements
 aisa kar mukhyamantri ke pad ko nicha dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 Pappu Yadav alleged that these leaders are making anti-nitish statements only at Lalu's behest
 nitish ke bayaan kii bhi kii aalochanapappu yadav ne nitish kumaar ke bhi us bayaan kii aalochana kii jisamen unhone kaha tha ki unhen janadesh bihar ke shashan ke liye mila he naa ki shahabuddin jaison ke bayanon par pratikriya dene ke liye
 Pappu Yadav said that when Nitish got the mandate for the first time, he was against Lalu Yadav and meant to uphold the rule of law in Bihar
 pappu yadav ne aarope lagaaya ki bihar main sattarudh dal or vipaksh anant singh, surajbhaan singh, dhumal singh or sunil pandeya jaise aparaadhiyon ko sangrakshan de rahe hai
 Pappu Yadav said that since joining Lalu Yadav in the last two years, Nitish's image as CM has suffered a great deal, crimes have increased in the state, as well as criminals have become fearless

 pappu yadav ne kaha ki wo chandrakeshwar prasad ko cese ladane ke liye tatkaal ek lakh rupye or phir har maheene das hajaar rupye kii madad karenge

 Referring to the smart city, a common citizen Ram Avatar told NDTV, “dirt is the biggest problem
 kuch bhi planning hoti he, vah sahi tareeke se lagu nahin hoti
 "recently, Jaipur came in at number 215 out of 434 cities in the Clean Cities ranking
 lekin shahar ke kuch sthanon par 50 smart dustbin rakhe gaye hai
 Under the Smart City, they have been implemented as pilot projects in the city
 jab ye kachare se bhar jate hai, inamen sensor signal detaa he ki safai karmi ko bhejo or inhen saafe karwaao
 In the city that is facing the problem of cleanliness, it seems that such smart dustbins which are being installed on a large scale in the future will be able to find some solutions

 " video main dikhaai de rahaa he ki rani chatarji khataron ke khilaadi ke liye kaaphi mehnat kar rahi hai or mukaable main behatar pradarshan ke liye apni puri jaan bhi laga rahi hai
 Let us tell you that Rani Chatterjee is one of the tremendous actress of Bhojpuri cinema
 haalanki ab vah jald hi vah khataron se khelte hue 'khataron ke khilaadi' main bhi najar aaengi
 These days, Bhojpuri actress is busy preparing for this show
 is sho main behatar pradarshan ke liye unhone kai video or photo bhi soshal media par saajha kiya he
 Apart from all this, Queen Rani Chatterjee of Bhojpuri Cinema is also known for her impunity
 saal 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi uttar pradesh main record maton se jeet hasil karte hue 73 siton par kaabiz hui thi
 This time too, the claim is not 73 but 74 seats
 lekin seat daavon se nahin, samikarnon se milti he or is dafe sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan ne bijepi ke is sameekaran ko gadabada diya hai
 This is the reason why CM Yogi Adityanath has now started breaking the dalit-yadav i
e
 'DY' formula
 isiilie kabhi dalit ke choukhat par to kabhi yadavon ke math main apni aamad darj kara rahe hai
 After the disputed statement, CM Yogi Adityanath may not have been directly campaigning since the Election Commission's three-day ban, but he is giving messages by visiting temples and monasteries
 lakhanu main uske baad ve ayodhya pahunche jahaan unhone mandir darshan ke baad dalit ke ghar bhojan kar ek bada sandesh dene kii koshish kii
 Significantly, in the 2014 elections, the BJP was able to make a dent in the vote of the Dalits to a large extent, to keep it in its court, the BJP also continued to exercise
 daliton ke bhagwaan sant ravidaas ke mandir main piem se lekar siem tak na sirf kai baar aa chuke he balki yahaan lungar chakhkar is ilaake ke vikaas ke liye bhi kai yojanaon kii ghoshnaa bhi kii he
 Now once again, Yogis have started their campaign to increase their proximity to Dalits by eating food
 daliton ke liye bijepi kii ye ranneeti koi nai nahin he saal 2014 kaa ellection jab aise hi bijepi ke sheersh netaaon kii tasviir daliton ke ghar bhojan karne kii dikhaai padati thi
 This time it has been started by Yogi in the state
 is baar sapa-basapa kaa gathbandhan he lihaaja bijepi kii nigaah yadav vot main bhi send lagane kii he
 This is the reason why Yogi, who arrived in Varanasi on the third day of the ban, started his tour with a vision of Bajrang Bali, but after that Yogi reached Adityanath Yadav community's largest monastery, Gadhwaghat
 aapako bataa den ki varanasi main ye vah math he jahaan yadav samaaj kii aasthaa zyaada he ise wo bhagwaan krishna ke vanshaj ke rup main dekhte hai
 Arriving here, the yogi fed the cow green fodder and jaggery and accompanied the ashram's mahant
 upi ke andar abhi tak yadavon par samaajawaadee party kaa ekadhikaar rahaa he
 The BJP feels that the way it connected the Dalits with itself, it can also add the Yadavs
 saal 2014 main bijepi ne soshal ejineering kaa formula laate hue daliton ke saath pichde varg ko apane saath joda
 Now it is the turn of the Yadav community, which has so far stayed away from the BJP
 bijepi is myth ko todna chaahati he or uski ummid gadhwaghat ashram par tiki he
 The BJP knows very well that if the Yadavs are completely mobilized under the SP-BSP alliance, their equation may be disturbed in many seats
 lekin bada sawaal ye he ki kya yadav samaaj bijepi ko gale lagayegaa kya soobe ke mukhiya kii ye kavayad pradesh main sapa basapa gathbandhan par asar daalega
 The answer will be known only after the elections
 At present, the BJP is playing its every wager

 com / l6w9zadplv— mayaa (@vijaymerajaan)december 11, 2019 Had radio waves been able to report the latest organizational movements within the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the first week of April would have been revealed by the loud phone bells between Chennai and Kolkata
 kuch hi ghanton ke bheetar donon shaharon ke bich jane kitne phone khatkhata chuke the
 Then, if these waves could catch the tone and style of the phone conversation, it would have immediately given the news of that huge upheaval, it was not a minor conversation
 baaten angaar ugal rahi thim
 The International Cricket Council (ICC) President Narayanaswamy Srinivasan was disillusioned with his failure to attend the selection of committee members and the cancellation of the Bangladesh tour in June
 unhone to kathith taur par bisisiai adhyaksh jagmohan daalamia ko unki baat na maanane par hataane kii karrwai shuru karne kii dhamkee bhi de daali
 Finally, an angry phone call from Kolkata to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who was in Washington at the time
 is phone ke baad shrinivasana achaanak shant ho gaye
 So far this undisputed king of the cricket world has been seen licking the dust
 cricket kii duniya main 70 varshiya shrinivasana ke utthan or patan ko pichley ek dashak ke sabase dilachasp kisse ke rup main yaad kiya jayega
 This was the same period when this serious game of Bhadralok turned into a Twenty20 money-earning circus and earned so much money that no one had imagined
 phir bhi shrinivasana kaa kissa maidan par hue khel ke anokhe pradarshan or yahaan tak ki 2011 main gharelu maidan par team india kii vishwa cap vijay ko bhi feekaa kar saktaa he
 Perhaps this anecdote also makes the strange story of his friend turned enemy Lalit Modi, who has been living in self-exile in London for the last five years
 ipiel ke janmdata modi ko yah gumaan ho gaya tha ki ve puri vyavastha se bade ho gaye hai
 Eventually, the board told him his status, which does not remain as a prisoner of anyone
 jaise 2005 main daalamia or ab shrinivasana ko bhi unki aukaat bataa di gai
 In this way, BCCI is a cycle that takes more than it gives
 iskaa pahiyaa hameshaa ghumta rahata he or cricket satta kii seedhi ke badale ek sanyog zyada banaata he
 Actually, politicians, industrialists, lobbyists, promoters, sportsmen-turned-agents and all kinds of people-turned-commentators, choose the next "king"
 bisisiai pichley teen dashak main ek gaiyrmunafe vaale sanghathan se 2,286 karod ru
 Has turned into an annual business corporate
 beshak, yahaan daanv oonche lage hote hai
 The addiction to get command is not reduced
 hameshaa koi doosraa gaddi hathiyaane ke liye taiyaar rahata he or phir vah bhi apni phislan tak kaayam rahata he
 At present, the discussion is about Srinivasan
 unka kasoor yah he ki unhone puure board ko hi naaraaz kar diya or ab unke saamne isisi adhyaksh kaa pad ganvaane kaa bhi khatra khadaa ho gaya he
 He had nominated himself to the post last summer despite all the controversies
 bisisiai kii aantarik vyavastha se parichit ek purv sadsy kehete hai, ''ham sabhi jaanate hai ki bisisiai kaa cricket se koi lenadena nahin he
 This is just to control that
 haalanki vakt ke saath uske aakaa zyada dhoort hote ja rahe hai
 When Dalmiya was beaten, he quietly began to concentrate in the Cricket Association of Bengal and waited for his time
 jab modi ko laga ki ipiel chairman ke naate unka vakt puraa hua to ve england bhaag gaye or board ko apane twit or li se pareshaan karte rahe
 Now Srinivasan is trying to save his empire by putting all kinds of tricks
 ʼʼunki do badi galtiyaan hai, jinamein unhone bisisiai ke saajha hiton ke badale apane hit ko zyada tavajjo di he
 The Supreme Court directed that they can remain the administrators of cricket or the owners of the IPL team
 is par unhone ek haasyaaspad-si yojana ke jariye bisisiai ko jhansa dene kii koshish kii
 4,000 crores Rs
 kii company india cement ke chairman or managing diarector shrinivasana ne ek sahyogi company banaai or chennai super kings ko use mahaj 5 lakh ru
 , The brand value of which the American Appraisal firm sold for Rs 450 crore
 aanka he
 It was reportedly done so that the BCCI, which took 5 per cent of the money on every sale, got just Rs 25,000
 mili
 The board's newly formed Working Committee has banned the sale
 shri niwasana par aakhri chot shaayad april ke aakhri hafte main hi padi, jab isisi ke tantra kaa kathith taur par durupyog karte hue unhone bisisiai ke nae sachiv, bijepi ke saansad anuraag thakur or ek sandigdh sattebaaj ke bich sambandh kaayam karnaa chaha
 Though the charge has not been dismissed yet, Thakur immediately retaliates
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki shrinivasana landan kii ek form se kuch bisisiai sadasyon kii jasusi karvaa rahe hai
 He also said that he is being reviewed as a BCCI representative in the ICC
 is tarah shrinivasana cricket kii duniya ke samraat se achaanak ek aise shaks main tabdeel ho gaye hai, jinke sir par talwaar latak rahi he
 The story of his downfall begins with two parallel anecdotes
 do saal pehle unke damaad gurunath mayppan kaa naam mumbai police kii spot phixing main ubhara, jiske baad board ke kriyalap kii jaanch ke liye purv hycourt jaj mukul mudgal ke netritv main supreme court kii jaanch samiti gathit hui
 As the matter progressed, Srinivasan's position in the board began to wane
 phir bhi unhone tamaam jhanjhawaton ke baavjood board par apni pakad banaae rakhi
 At first, he refused to resign from the post of BCCI chairman saying that he or Chennai Super Kings had nothing to do with Meiyappan
 phir aisa maahaul banaaya ki hatane ke baavjood unki pakad bani rahe or 2014 main unhone khud hi apane ko isisi ke chairman ke liye namjad kar liya
 After receiving the Mudgal report, in January 2015, the Supreme Court finally ruled that Srinivasan cannot contest the BCCI elections
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki ipiel team kii milkiyat chhodkar ve hiton kii takaraahat kaa maamla dur karen
 On this occasion also he 'helped' Dalmiya to become the President of BCCI
 shaayad is ummid main ki ve aage unki madad karenge
 The next story begins this April
 melbern ke cricket maidan main australia ko 2015 vishwa cap kii trophy saunpane ke dauraan shrinivasana kii hooting ke fouran baad
 Two days later, ICC President Mustafa Kamal announced his resignation, which was nominated by the Bangladesh Cricket Board, as Srinivasan's arbitrary conduct in the ICC
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki isisi to vyaavhaarik rup se indian cricket council hi ban gai he
 Worried over his statement, he continued to call Srinivasan Dalmiya to cancel the Bangladesh tour scheduled in June, causing the Bangladesh board to suffer huge financial losses
 par daalamia ne yah kahkar aisa karne se inkaar kar diya ki isse donon deshon ke kutanyik sambandhon par bura asar padegaa
 Srinivasan reportedly lost his temper and threatened to cancel the tour or face action to be removed immediately from the post of BCCI president
 naaraaz daalamia ne arun jetali ko phone kar is dhamkee ke bare main bataaya
 Jaitley is the most powerful minister at the center and dominates the Delhi Cricket Association
 udhar, shrinivasana ne bisisiai or isisi ke purv mukhiya or rashtravaadi congress party ke supremeo sharad pavaar se baatcheet kii
 Srinivasan, forgetting his enmity, wanted to befriend Pawar so that the interests of the two could be served later
 phir to kehete hai ki shrinivasana kaa samarthan kar rahe jetali ne apana kavach hataa liya or unhen akelaa chhod diya
 Now the lobby of dalmia-thakur is preparing to call for an emergency meeting with members like former BCCI chief Shashank Manohar to propose to remove Srinivasan from the post of ICC chairman with immediate effect
 shrinivasana isisi main bisisiai ke pratinidhi hai
 Therefore, two-thirds or 21 votes will be required to remove them
 bisisiai ke ek varisht sadsy kehete hai, ''aap shrinivasana se dushmani mol lene kii baat nahin soch sakate the
 He made the whole system in his favor such that the required number was always with him
 lekin ab koi unase daraa hua nahin he
 If his case comes, then understand that he left the post of ICC chairman
 ʼʼ bisisiai sadasyon kii unase naaraazgi ke kuch mudde is prakaar hai
 One, during the tenure of Srinivasan, India Cement or Tamil Nadu Cricket Association officials used to stay with Team India on one or the other excuse
 do, rajya associationon main apane prati vafadari dekhakar hi antarrashtriya khel unke ilaake main tay karnaa
 Three, the BCCI engaged in the prosecution of the cases against him, 320 crore
 or chauthaa, shrinivasana ke khilaaf maamalon se supreme court ko bisisiai ke kriyalap main jhaankne kaa mauka mila
 The journey ahead is not easy for Srinivasan now
 sutron ke mutabik daalamia-thakur toli ne isisi se shrinivasana ko baahar karne ke liye sitambar main aam sabha kii baithak hone tak intjaar karnaa behatar samajha he
 However, their days are numbered
 kehete hai, billi kii nau jaan hoti he
 But Srinivasan probably has ten or eleven
 sach to ye he ki ab ve bilkul akele rah gaye hai
 The former treasurer, secretary and president of BCCI have now left all the companions alone
 antarrashtriya manch par log unhen dutkaar chuke hai or supreme court un par apana hathaudaa chalaa chukaa he

 india today samooh ke pehle state of state odisha conklev main odisha ke vitt mantri shashi bhushan behera ne shirkat kii
 Inaugurating the State of State Odisha Chapter, India Today Group Admiral Director Raj Chengappa said that India Today magazine has put on stage the Odia government, industry leaders and experts from agriculture to technology to take stock of Odisha's economic situation
 Collected on
 is satr ke dauraan rajya ke vitt mantri ne bataaya ki aarthik vikaas kii daud main vah gujarat se kaise or kahaan pichad gaya he
 During the question-and-answer session of this session, Raj Chengappa, Shashi Behera said that the implementation of GST from July 1 was a hasty step
 maujuuda kendra sarkaar ne ise lagu karne main jaldbaaji dikhaai haalanki jiesti lagu karne kii taiyaari beete 17 varshon se kendra or rajya kii sarkarein kar rahi hai
 Behera said on the problems faced by GST, that these problems will be seen only during the transition
 jiesti council prati maah mulaakaat kar rahi he or rajyon ko aane vaali dikkaton kaa hal nikaalane kii kavayad kii ja rahi he
 Behera said that GST is a popular model all over the world

 raaj chengappa ne poocha ki notebandi kaa kya asar odisha main dekhne ko mila he
 Behera said that demonetisation was just a paper war
 bahut kam maatra main cash bachaa rahaa jo arthvyavastha main waapas nahin aayaa
 So the question is, where is the black money? Read also: SOS Conclave Odisha: This is the 'odisha Model' of development
 Behera said that 50 percent of the villages in Odisha are still outside the banking network
 lihaaja aap andaja laga sakate hai ki rajya main notebandi ke baad gramin ilaakon main logon ko puraani karency ke badale nai karency lene main kitna nuksaan uthaanaa padaa he
 RJD asked Behera whether the Modi government at the Center has done justice to his state during the last three years
 behera ne bataaya ki kendra se railway, natural kalamity jaise tamaam kshetron main rajya ko kendra se nyaay dekhne ko nahin mila he
 During the session Behera was asked that the governments of Odisha and Bihar were welcomed during the demonetisation
 naveen patnayak ne bhi iskaa swaagat kiya tha
 But now the state government is saying that demonetisation has caused damage
 behera ne kaha ki notebandi bataur niti thik kadam tha lekin ise thik tarah se lagu nahin kiya gaya
 Ajit Jha asked Behera that there is Gujarat at one end in the map of the country and Odisha at the other end
 lekin gujarat kii tulana main kyon odisha itnaa pichhadaa hua he? behera ne bataaya ki odisha main 17-18 saal se sarkaar ne vikaas kii shakl ko badalane kii koshish kii he
 During this time, Odisha has done a great job in the field of industry and agriculture
 lekin factory lagane main rajya pichhadaa he jahaan gujarat ko zyada phayda pahunchaa he
 To eliminate this gap, we need large loans from the central government and abroad so that Odisha can shine like Gujarat

 This association of officials has claimed that people across the country are afraid of the proposed FRDI bill by the central government, so people are preferring to keep cash with them instead of depositing money in the bank
 is sanghathan ke mutabik rigerv bank of india digital iconomi banane ke liye cash kii rashning kar rahaa he jisase kai rajyon main cash kaa sankat dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 The decrease of 30 to 40 per cent currency in circulation is due to the exit of Rs 2000 and Rs 500 currency circulation

 It is to be noted that one of the important functions of the resolution corporation is also to provide deposit insurance to the customers, although the limit of this insurance has not been fixed yet
 kyon he echardiai bill se darefardiai bill ke jariye rejolution corporation ko fail hone vaali sanstha ko ubaarane ke liye (bel in) kadam uthaane kaa bhi adhikaar he
 While the government invests the money of the public in a sluggish economy through bailout, it can be used to bail it out, while the bail-in is used to salvage the bank in crisis with the money of bank customers

 There may be a lot of tussle between the Kejriwal government and the central government in the capital Delhi, but the Modi government can give very good news to the mlas of Delhi
 sutron kii maane to centre sarkaar vidhayakon kii tankhwaah badhaane par sahamat ho gai he
 In fact, after the Kejriwal government came to power, Aam Aadmi Party mlas have been demanding to increase their salary
 aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon kaa kahana he ki dilli main vidhayakon kii selary bahut kam he
 In 2015, the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Government introduced a bill for increment of mlas in the Legislative Assembly, which was also passed by the Legislative Assembly
 bill ke paas hote hi vidhayakon kii selary main 400 fisadi kaa ijapha hona tha lekin centre kii manjuuri nahin milane kii vajah se intjaar or lanbaa hota gaya
 Accordingly, the basic salary of Delhi mlas, which was earlier Rs 12 thousand, was increased to Rs 50 thousand
 iske saath, bhatte or pension main bhi badhotaree kii gai thi
 But in February 2017, the Central Government had put a brake on the proposal of Kejriwal Government to increase the salary of Delhi mlas and the Home Ministry sought further information from the Delhi Government on the issue with returning the bill
 phir april 2018 main dilli vidhansabha main phir is mudde ko aam aadmi party ke vidhayak vishesh ravi ne uthaaya tha or kaha tha ki vidhayakon kii selary 12 hajaar he, jabaki selary 2 se 2
 Should be 5 lakhs
 saath hi unhone ye bhi kaha tha ki selary kam hone ke kaaran vidhayakon kii shaadi bhi nahin ho paa rahi he
 The salary is so low that it is not possible to run a house
 shaadishuda vidhayakon ke bachche hue hai, kharche bad rahe hai
 At the same time, relations are not coming for the mlas who are not married
 vipaksh ke saathiyon ko bhi isapar raay rakhni chahie or bataaen grih mantri ke paas kab chalenge
 After that Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia proposed a proposal by the Delhi Assembly under which a 6-member committee was formed on the issue
 jiskaa kaam is mudde par centre sarkaar se baat karnaa tha
 In this committee, apart from Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, 3 'AAP' mlas Saurav, Sanjeev, Praveen and the remaining 2 BJP mlas Sirsa, OP Sharma were included in the committee
 vahiin sadan main bijepi vidhayak om prakaash sharma ne is prastaav kaa samarthan kiya or kaha ki 'ham is prastaav ke saath hai
 The Chief Minister should act positively on this
 vidhayakon kii selary kam hone kii vajah se shaadi nahin ho rahi he
 Salary should be increased by marriage
 sutron ke mutabik is cameti ne grih mantri se lekar vit mantri tak apni baat pahunchaai thi
 If sources are to be believed, the Union Home Ministry has passed the proposal and sent it to the Finance Ministry
 sutron ne bataaya ki ab jald hi modi sarkaar dilli ke vidhayakon ko khushkhabari de sakati he
 Under the Ministry of Labor's Maternity Benefit Act 1961, in every office where there are more than 30 women employees, the facility of crèche is mandatory
 yah suvidha kuch companiyon main dekhne ko milti he, par adhikansh nijee companiyon main yah suvidha nadaarad he
 In such a situation, it is difficult for a working woman to carry both her child and office responsibilities
 lihaaja, karnataka sarkaar ne is ore ek anokhi pahal kii he
 The Karnataka government has issued a notification to all private companies located in the state to pay for the crèche to all the female employees working in the company
 rajya sthit sabhi companiyon ke liye ise anivaary kar diya gaya he
 a 10-month-old girl came to Krech with the heart that the heart state would be heartbroken, the state government has issued 15 instructions related to women working on contracts in private companies, including payment for the crèche
 iske alaava companiyon ko mahila karmchaariyon ko pick and drop kii suvidhaayen bhi deni hongi
 Also, it has to be ensured that the drop of women does not happen at the end

 During this, bjp's UP in-charge Amit Shah took the mic on the stage and praised Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki upi main campan ke dauraan modi kii lahar kaa bahut phayda mila
 Apart from this, he said that the NDA will form the government with absolute majority and if any party wants to support it it will be welcome
 upi campan main karnaa padaa chunautiyon kaa saamana
 
 
 Amit Shah, a close aide of Narendra Modi, said that in UP we have been out of power for 17 years, the organizational structure was also broken
 vahiin agar sakaaratmak paksh dekhen to puure desh main modi kii lahar kaa yahaan phayda mila
 Our committees are set up at more than 76 booths
 bijepi se kai youth jude hai
 People from every section of the society joined the party and that too with all their heart
 modi or mere rishte party ke kaam ko lekar
 
 
 When Amit Shah was asked about the close relationship between him and Modi, he said, 'my and Modi's relationship is seen to be exaggerated
 party kaa main karmchaaree hum
 There is a relationship between me and Modi ji about the functioning of the party
 'modi bahut parishramee netaa
 
 
 Praising Modi, Amit Shah said, 'modi ji is a very hard working leader, he held 435 meetings during the election campaign
 modi ji sabase zyada sabhaayen sambodhit karne vaale netaa hai
 i do not think any leader has addressed so many meetings during the election campaign till date
 'helicopter shauk nahin aavashyaktaa
 
 
 When asked about where the money comes from, Amit Shah uses corporate helicopters for his meetings, Shah said, “the BJP party's scope is from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and Assam to Gujarat
 agar itani reliyaan kerani hoti hai to helicopter kaa prayog karnaa shauk nahin jarurat he
 'my statement in Azamgarh was misquoted
 
 
 amit shah se jab azamgarh main unke vivaadit bayaan ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'maine kuch galat nahin kaha tha
 My statement was taken incorrectly
 aatankwaad communal nahin rashtravirohi baat he
 The Indian Mujahideen's mausal is Azamgarh based, apart from this, the masterminds of many big blasts of the country came from Azamgarh
 upi sarkaar or centre sarkaar kii vajah se aisa hua he
 The terrorist trend has increased
 'shaayad mere grahon main likhaa vivaadon main rahanaa
 
 
 When Shah was asked why he and the controversies co-exist with choli-daman, his answer was something like, 'maybe my planet Dasha will be like this
 meri najar main vivaad main rahane kaa ek kaaran ye he ki main apni raay bebaaki se rakhata hum
 Do not hesitate to give my opinion
 'artical 370 kaa sampradayikta se lenaa-dena nahin
 
 
 Amit Shah said, 'it is wrong to associate article 370 with communalism
 artical 370 kaa sampradayikta se kuch lenaa-dena nahin he
 The party will work on whatever is written in the party's manifesto
 saalon se chale aa rahe party ke mudde ghoshnaa patr main likhe hai
 In public affection for Modi, Amit Shah said, 'we have no question of fearing anyone
 modi jab namakan bharne varanasi pahunche to log unke kafile ke peeche-peeche aae
 We did not call anyone
 janata usee netaa ke saath hoti he jiske prati uske man main sneh hota he or sweekruti hoti he
 'voters have no religion
 
 
 amit shah se jab poocha gaya ki upi ke alpsankhyakon ke bich party ke prati bhay he to unhone kaha, 'agar bhay he to ham is bhay ko hataayenge
 There is no reason to fear
 main or meri party kaa uddeshy votaron ko hindu-muslim main baantnaa nahin he
 We are being propagated against
 desh ke voter kaa koi dharm nahin hota
 'there will be no injustice to anyone in Modi's government' Amit Shah said, 'there will be no injustice to any citizen in Modi's government
 ham communal nahin bananaa chaahate
 The party's focus has always been on the agenda
 mujhe ye kehane main koi dikkat nahin he ki sapa ne bhedbhaavpurn tareeke se sarkaar chalaai
 'amit Shah said he will win 300 seats,' We will win 300 seats and form the government with an absolute majority
 desh ke vikaas ke agenda par jo bhi party saath aana chaheti he uskaa swaagat he
 a simple target on Kejriwal
 
 
 amit shah se jab kejariwal par sawaal kiya gaya to unhone tanj kasate hue kaha, 'kejariwal koun si kitaab padhate hai pataa nahin
 After the election, they will definitely take an interview
 'amit shah se jab poocha gaya ki vadodara yaa varanasi main koun si seat chunenge modi to unhone kaha, ''main varanasi kii janata se apil karata hum ki wo modi ji ko itane baari maton se jitaayen ki ye vivaad hi khatm ho jaae ki wo koun si seat chunenge
 This time in Varanasi, there will be census but not counting
 'mere bare main faisla party karegi
 
 
 When Amit Shah was asked what his role would be next, he said, 'I have never made a decision about myself, i agree with what the party decides

 Forgetting 23 years of enmity, the SP-BSP is going to start the election campaign simultaneously from Deoband in western Uttar Pradesh on the lines of 25 years ago
 sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav, basapa pramukh mayawati or areldi chif choudhary ajit singh ek manch se janata ko sambodhit kar raajnneetik sameekaran saadhane kii kavayad karenge
 Not only the rally but also political matters are hidden behind these three leaders coming on a platform against the BJP
 soobe main sapa-basapa ne jab-jab haath milaayaa he tab-tab bijepi ko maat khaani padi he
 The 90s was the era of the Ram Mandir movement, but when the mulayam-kanshi Ram entered the fray in the 1993 assembly elections, the BJP was completely wiped out
 isi tarah se 2018 main upi ke upachunaav main basapa ke samarthan se sapa ne bijepi ko dhul chataa di thi
 But this time in the Lok Sabha elections, the coalition has a big challenge to repeat its history
 aise main devband main hone vaali gathbandhan yah raily chunavi ranbhumi kaa mizaaj tay karegi
 Voting will be held on April 11 for the 8 Lok Sabha seats of the first phase of West Uttar Pradesh
 saharanpur, kairana, meerut, mujffarnagar, bagpat, bijanour, gajiabad or gautamabuddhanagar seat he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, these eight seats were won by BJP
 lekin pichley saal kairana seat par hue upachunaav main bijepi ko maat khaani padi thi or basapa-sapa ke samarthan se areldi ne jeet darj karne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Mulayam Singh Yadav West UP, along with BSP founder Kanshi Ram, was considered a stronghold of the BSP and the RLD at one stage, but in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP managed to capture the political ground of these two parties
 isi vajah he ki bijepi jahaan apane varchasv ko barkaraar rakhane kii jaddojahad kar rahi he
 At the same time, it is a challenge for the BSP, RLD and SP alliance to get their lost land
 isi maddenjar pratham charan se hi badhat lene ke liye har raajnneetik dal puri takat laga rahaa he
 In West UP, BJP has held several rallies one after the other
 pradhanmantri narendra modi in aath siton ke liye meerut or saharanpur main jansabha ko sambodhit kar chuke hai
 While the first rally of the alliance has been held in Saharanpur on Sunday, the three leaders Akhilesh, Mayawati and Ajit Singh will be united on some stage
 pashchimi upi kaa jaateey samikarnapashchimi upi kii aath loksabhaa siton par jaateey samikarnon par bhi in teen netaaon kii nigahen hai
 As part of this special strategy, the coalition has decided to start election rallies from Deoband region
 is raily ke jariye gathbandhan kaa prayaas pashchimi upi main jat, muslim or anusuchit jati kaa gathjod majboot karnaa mana ja rahaa he
 The Dalit, Muslim and Jat voters are the decision makers in West UP
 isiilie sameekaran ko saadhane ke liye teenon netaa saath aae hai
 Mayawati will try to help the Dalit voters
 vahiin, muslim matadaataaon ko akhilesh yadav or jat samudaay ko choudhary ajit singh saadhane kii kavayad karenge
 Interestingly, the link to the reason for which BSP President Mayawati resigned from Rajya Sabha membership also connects with this Saharanpur
 aise main mayawati jahaan apane samudaay ko ye sandesh dene kii koshish karengi unki aawaaj uthaane vaale vah eklauti netaa hai
 Mayawati has also represented herself from Saharanpur seat, in such a situation, she is trying to win this seat in harahal
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne pashchim upi kii apni jansabhaon ke dauraan areldi adhyaksh choudhary ajit singh or jayant choudhary par siyaasi prahaar kiye hai, uskaa palatwaar devband main ho rahi gathbandhan kii siyaasi raily se kiya ja saktaa he
 As much as western UP is a belt of farmers belt, in such a situation, Chaudhary Ajit Singh can surround the BJP by raising the issue of farmers
 iske alaava areldi ke liye ye chunaav karo yaa maro kii sthiti vaala he
 The fate of both father and son is decided in the first phase
 aise main unhen apane aapako har main sabit karne kii chunauti he
 At the same time, this is the only rally of the three coalition leaders for the first phase
 aise main teenon netaa ek saath aakar apane kaaryakartaaon or matadaataaon ko bhi bada sandesh dene kii koshish he ki wo ek hai or aap bhi ek ho jaaen
 If an experiment is successful in Saharanpur, then the road ahead for the alliance will become much easier
 pehle charan se bane maahaul ko soobe kii baaki hisson main gathbandhan cash karaane kii koshish karegaa

 vaise antat kya hota he, iskaa pataa aapako film dekhakar hi chalegaa
 Actor Rajkumar has played the role of the half-head, playing this leader

 - diarection bahut badhiya he or chote shahar ke flavor ko bade achche tareeke se dikhaaya gaya he
 - Rajkumar Rao has played two different types of characters in the film, one who is a lover of love and the other who is highly hated
 iske saath hi kriti kharbanda kaa kirdaar bhi kaabil i tarif he
 The rest of the work of Manoj Pahwa, Govind Namdev and artists is effortless
 - film ke kuch gane kahani ko aage le jate hai, to vahin kuch bor bhi karte hai
 The dialogues of the film make you laugh somewhere
 kamjor kadiyaan- film kii kamjor kadiyon main isaki kahani he
 The beginning of the story is interesting but after the interval the story falls apart
 - mudda first half main aapako baandhne kii koshish karata he wo second half main chhutata hua dikhaai detaa he jisko tite kiya jaataa to film kisi or level kii banakar saamne aati
 This actor once had to find work, now the film nominated Oscar - the domestic drama could also be written in a much better way
 film ke gane relies se pehle hit nahin ho paae
 The box office film has a budget of around 15 crores and has been released in over 800 screens

 If the law is implemented properly, there will be no problem
 unhone kaha ki sapa kadi sajaa ke paksh main hai, lekin main vyaktigat taur par kisi bhi tarah ke mrityudand ke khilaaf hum
 On the question of the opposition parties including Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) declaring the SP government as a failure on law and order in Uttar Pradesh, Ram Gopal said that it is sp's misfortune that when people get nothing to say, they will Raises the issue of law and order
 ramgopal ne kaha ki uttar pradesh sarkaar ke jin vibhaagon kii ore se rachanaatmak kaam nahin ho paa rahe hai or bajet kaa paisa kharch nahin ho paa rahaa he, unase sambaddh mantriyon ko hataa dena chahie

 This information was allegedly used during the election to win the trump and tarnish the image of the adversary
 (input-ieenes) The bugle of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections can be blown at any time
 bijepi kii ore se uske sabase bade star prachaarak khud pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pradesh ke alag-alag hisson main reliyon kaa silsilaa aarambh kar diya he lekin party kii ore se baar-baar daawey kiye jane ke baavjood ab tak pratyaashiyon kii list final na kar paanaa sawaal khadey kar rahaa he
 The Congress is still hanging the list of its candidates waiting for an alliance with the Samajwadi Party, while in the Samajwadi Party, two lists have come out from Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav
 keshav prasad maury ne jab bijepi ke upi pradeshdhyaksh pad kii kursi sanbhali thi tabhi daawa kiya tha ki party jald hi ummidavaaron ke chayan kii prakriya shuru kar degi
 Later the news came that the party would announce the names of its candidates in October so that they could get enough time to prepare for the election
 party ne bahut pehle candidate ke sellection ke maanak tay kar die the lekin ab jabaki chunaav kii ghoshnaa kisi bhi vakt ho sakati he,bijepi kii listsamne nahin aa pai he
 Uttar Pradesh has 47 mlas at present in the Bharatiya Janata Party
 mana ja rahaa he ki sabhi maujuuda vidhayakon ko party kii ore se ek baar phir tikat dekar maidan main utaara jayega lekin baaki kii 350 se zyada siton par uske candidate chunaav ke kuch hafte pehle tak ghoshit nahin ho paae hai
 It is believed that after today's Lucknow rally of the Prime Minister, the party's first list can be revealed
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne haal hi main ek raily main sanket diya tha ki party is baar yuvaaon ko zyada tikat degi lekin isse itar uski sabase badi chunauti upi main jaateey samikarnon ko sadhate hue aise ummidavaar khojna he jo desh ke is sabase bade soobe kii satta se unka vanvaas khatm kar sake
 Like SP-BSP rebels, like other parties, where the BJP will also play bets on the candidate who has the victory, he is also looking at the final list of SP and BSP candidates
 upi ke har chunaav main baagi ummidavaar kaaphi ahm bhoomika nibhaate hai
 Those candidates of SP and BSP who have the victory but have failed to get tickets, BJP can field them as candidates
 uski list main deree kii sabase badi vajah yahi bataai ja rahi he
 According to an English newspaper, the focus of the BJP is more on PM Modi's rally than on the list and then on farmer seminars
 baaki partiyaan bhi fansi he list final karne ke pher menupi main sabase zyada vidhayakon vaali sattarudh samaajawaadee party to ummidavaaron kii list ke chakkar main do faad ho gai he to duusari ore congress sapa ke saath apane sambhavit gathbandhan ke intjaar main apni list latakaae hue hai
 It is worth mentioning that the Congress had first declared its CM candidate here and described Sheila Dixit, the Chief Minister of Delhi for 15 years as its leader
 mukhya vipakshi dal bahujan samaaj party ne sabase pehle apane ummidavaar final kiye the lekin uske baad se wo us list main itane badlaav kar chuki he ki uski ore se bhi abhi final list kaa hi intjaar he
 The news coming from Bihar is encouraging for Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, and for Narendra Modi
 yahaan chaar daur kii voting main 27 sansadeey siton ke liye vot daale ja chuke hai
 The seven seats for which votes were cast on April 30 include Darbhanga and Madhubani
 yahaan muslim votaron kaa ekamusth vot ummidavaar kii haar yaa jeet tay karata he
 There are about six seats, where there is a similar situation
 kishanganj, bhagalpur, katihaar or purniya main voting 24 april ko hi ho chuki he
 On May 7 and 12, voting will be held for the remaining 13 seats
 madhubani main argedy pratyaashee abdul baari siddiki kii jeet tay maani ja rahi he
 However, here is BJP candidate Hukumdev Narayan Yadav, due to which BJP is also able to get some Yadav votes
 lekin bijepi ke liye chintaa kii baat yah he ki yahaan brahman vot ke bantane kii baat saamne aa rahi he
 The Brahmins traditionally used to vote for the Congress party, this time have gone towards the RJD
 argedy-congress gathbandhan kii vajah se yahaan se congress ne apane ummidavaar shakeel ahamed ko maidan main nahin utaara
 As a result, the entire Muslim vote has gone to the RJD
 pichhali baar siddiki 1
 Hukumdev lost to Narayan Yadav by just nine thousand votes after getting 62 lakh votes
 gauratlab he ki tab shakeel ahamed ko ek lakh 10 hazaar vot mili the
 rjd's MAA Fatmi from Darbhanga is also seen heavily on bjp's Kirti Azad
 kul milakar lalu kaa muslim-yadav sameekaran kaam karata nazar aa rahaa he
 The big thing that was understood during the visit to Bihar is that there are two types of anti-incumbency factor working here
 ek mahangaai aadi vajahon se centre sarkaar ke kilaaf he or doosraa nitish sarkaar ke nau saal ho chuke hai, aise main rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf bhi anti inakambency he
 While roads are good and electricity is improving, where Nitish is in favor, the industry business, lack of employment opportunities are still haunting people
 shiksha vyavastha abhi bhi puri tarah ke patari par nahin he or behatar padhai ke liye chaatro kaa bihar se baahar kaa rukh karnaa badastoor jari he
 There is also anger against Nitish from corruption spreading to the panchayat level
 jediu ke nivartmaan saansadon ke kilaaf yah rosh apana role nibhaa rahaa he
 The same thing applies against the outgoing BJP mps
 hukumdev narayan yadav ko lekar voter kehete hai ki paanch saal main ek baar bhi dehri par jhaankne nahin aae, kaam kii baat to dur
 Though the BJP is trying to put all the blame on jdu's forehead, it forgets that till last year it was involved in the coalition government
 lekin yah akelaa anti inkanmbency factor nahin, jisaki vajah se nitish pichad rahe hon or congress argedy-congress gathbandhan acha karne ja rahi ho
 This is a critique of the casteist politics of Bihar, which is raising Lalu once
 jediu-bijepi gathbandhan tuutane se vah vining formula khatm ho gaya, jo nitish ke liye rambaan sabit ho rahaa tha
 With the rise of Modi in BJP, polarization of Muslim votes is showing maximum color in Bihar
 mauqaa pate hi lalu ne is baar ke chunaav ko yadavon kii maryaada se jod diya
 He has been able to instill in the Yadavs that the reputation of the Yadavs has been hurt under Nitish's rule
 duusari taraf musalamaanon ko vah yah sandesh dene main kaamayaab rahe hai ki bijepi-modi ke kilaaf sirf vahi majbooti se lard sakate hai
 This is the reason that Muslims who have appreciated the policies like Nitish's Cycle Scheme for school children have also moved away from JDU
 kul milakar lalu ke M-Y sameekaran paravaan chadh rahaa he
 In such a situation, it should not be surprising if they get 14-15 or even more seats from the current four
 yah kaamayaabi or badi ho sakati thi, lekin kai siton par jediu ke ummidavaar vot katua ke rup main argedy kaa raste main mushkil paidaa kar rahe hai
 Take for example the seat of Bhagalpur, where the rjd's Bulo Mandal's chances of victory are high, but the JDU has tried to dent the Muslim vote by fielding Abu Kaiser here, which Shahnawaz Hussain of BJP got Can
 jahaan tak modi kii lahar kii baat he, to centre or rajya sarkaar ke kilaaf anti inkanmbency ke bich jab log vikalp kii taraf dekhte hai, to unhen sirf modi kaa cheharaa nazar aata he
 In the name of change, people are looking at Modi
 isamen bhi koi shaq nahin ki musalmaan voton ke dhruvikaran kii pratikriya main hindu vot main bhi dhruvikaran hua he, jo bijepi ke liye faaydemand he
 BJP is also benefiting from Ram Vilas Paswan's alliance with LJP
 kul milakar bijepi ke siton kii taadaad 18-20 ke aasapaas rah sakati he
 This will be much higher than the previous 12
 lekin vaisaa to nahin hi hoga jaisaa ki modi lahar yaa modi kii hawa ke taur par kaha or daawa kiya ja rahaa tha
 BJP will also increase this at the cost of JDU, whose number of seats can be reduced from 20 to 4-5
 to maan lijie kii bihar main nitish ke ummiido ke gubaare kii hawa nikalne vaali he
 At the same time, Modi's wind is also blowing above ground reality
 ajay devgan auki tamanna bhaatia kii 'himmatwala' relies ho chuki he
 Before the release, the film's director Sajid Khan made big claims
 aaie film kii samiksha main jaanate hai ki unke daavon main kitna dam tha
 How many mothers in the story have water in their eyes
 pareshaaniyon kii potli bahan
 Hot mood girlfriend
 uskaa villen baap
 a comedian leaving the fountain of laughter
 samasyaon se jujhataa maa kaa betaa, bahan kaa bhai, premika kaa dilaphenk aashiq or villen kaa hone vaala jamaai
 Miracles in the grace and goddess of the Mother Goddess
 raksha ke liye mata ke sher kaa aana
 That means Himmatwala
 sajid khan kii yahi jamaa-puunji he
 There is no newness in the story
 kuch bhi aisa nahin he jo darshakon ko pataa na ho
 Of course it is retro era, but at a time when high drama suspense thriller and masala films are being made, new stories are being written, in which case the film disappoints a bit
 kuch chote-chote seen hai jo gudgudate hai lekin kul milakar kahani main taazgi kaa abhaav najar aata he
 Sajid has been tried by fulltoo Entertainment
 lekin is baar ve chookte najar aate hai
 Star Appeal Ajay Devgan's acting is as good as ever
 unki entry par khub taaliyaan bajati hai
 But such occasions rarely come when the audience gets a chance to applause
 is film kaa sarprise package south kii sansani tamanna bhaatia he
 He has got strength in acting
 dance kamaal kaa he
 The eyes love to see them on screen
 sabase badi baat yah ki unke screen par aane par khub taaliyaan or sitiyaan bajati hai
 His dialogue is very much like, 'I hate the poor
 'agar kahen to paresh rawal film kii asal jaan hai
 Whenever they come, they go tickled
 narayan das kaa unka kirdaar madamast he
 Their dialogues laugh like, 'hath hai or Hammer, where did this mausoleum come in between these insects
 ' mahesh manjrekar ne bhi jamkar acting kii he
 The film seems nineteen compared to Sajid Khan's 'hey Baby', 'housefull' 1-2
 lekin masaale kaa chhaunk he
 First Row has a scope for audiences
 film chote centre or single screen main acha bijness kar sakati he
 There are fewer x Factors that can connect it with youth
 bas, itani si baat he ki aapako film bina kisi lod ke dekhni he
 Hero 'himmatwala' will do the rest
 lekin baahar nikalate ek darshak kii jubaan par yah jumala tha ki 1983 kii 'himmatwala' kuch zyada acchhee thi
 Overall, withdrawing money from the pockets of the audience will be a bit difficult

 On the first day of the Sydney Test, Umesh Yadav spent 97 runs, r Ashwin 88 runs, Bhuvneshwar Kumar 67 runs, Mo Shami 58 runs and part time bowler Suresh Raina scored 35 runs
 kisi bhi team ke liye ye aankada daraane vaala sabit ho saktaa he
 It's not just David Warner on a flat pitch in Sydney or kris rogers ne dhuandhar ballebaazi kii or warner ne series main teesraa or kariyar kaa 12waan test shatak puraa kar liya
 What is shocking for Team India is that the bowlers once again looked dull and proved too expensive
 team india ne pehle din paanch gendbaazon kaa istemaal kiya
 All the bowlers of Team India spent more than three runs per over
 umesh yadav ne to 16 over main 97 ran kharch kar die
 The first day's success is also r Ashwin and Moe
 shami ko hi mili
 The Indian team's difficulty is not new, fast bowlers ko puure series main jitani mushkilen pesh ai hai, us par kaafii charchaa ho chuki he
 The problem is that in the last three years, Indian spinners have also failed
 yani tej gendbaazi karnaa team india kii mushkil to bani hi hui he

 During the Melbourne Test in 1981, Team India, under captain Bishan Singh Bedi, defeated hosts Australia by 222 runs
 us test main bhartiya team ne bishan singh bedi (baanye haath ke spinner), erapalli prasanna (daanye haath ke of spinner) or bhagwat chandrashekhar (leg spinner) ne 18 wicket jatke
 There are many more such examples in Indian cricket history
 maujuuda daur main bhartiya team pesars yaa spinners ko taaqat banaakar nahin khel rahi
 Perhaps some T20s have an effect, some players' attitude
 lekin in sabakaa nuksaan bhartiya cricket ko lagaataar hota zarur dikhaai de rahaa he

 Seeking compensation for farmers, Uddhav Thackeray said that the state government has announced compensation of ten thousand crores for the loss caused to the farmers, that is very less
 vahiin shivasena kii maang he ki kisaanon ko turant prati hectares 25000 rupee turant diya janaa chahie
 This amount is the right of every farmer, which Shiv Sena will keep by getting it

 ek taraf uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath sahit uttar pradesh kii puri sarkaar daliton ke ghar main khaanaa kha rahi he to duusari taraf yogi ne aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan kii baat kar apni nazren 2019 chunaav par tikaa di he
 Yogi Adityanath had announced in the Legislative Assembly after the two by-election defeats that the government could soon make a provision for reservation within backward castes and Dalits
 aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan kaa yah formula bihar jaise rajyon main hit he
 On the same lines, preparations are being made to lay a similar reservation in Uttar Pradesh
 yogi sarkaar ne vidhansabha ke bheetar iske sanket de die the ki vah pichhadon main ati pichhadaa or daliton main ati dalit kaa ek sab-group bananaa chaahati he jisamen aarakshan sabhi jatiyon tak pahunch sake
 It is believed that before 2019, the government can implement reservation within the reservation, under which another quota will be fixed in the quota of backward castes, in which a quota of other backward castes except rich backward castes will be prepared, which is now Till the benefits of reservation are completely denied and only one or two sections of backward castes are taking full advantage of reservation
 yogi sarkaar main mantri omprakash rajbhar ke mutabik is bare main sarkaar chunaav ke 6 maheene pehle aakhri faisla le sakati he or is baat kii charchaa unhonemukhyamantri or amit shahdonon se khud kii he
 Om Prakash Rajbhar said that the Yogi government can form the basis of the report of the Social Justice Committee made by Rajnath Singh in June 2001 to implement the reservation within the reservation, in which the government is "A" "B" and "C" among the backward castes
 'can create three sub-categories
 saamaajik nyaay samiti kii report ke mutabik pichhadon ko milane vaale 27 fisadi aarakshan main kareeb 2
 Only 3 percent of the castes swallow the entire reservation of backward castes
 aise main pichhadaa, ati pichhadaa or atyant pichhadaa teen category main aarakshan ko vibhajit kiya jaae
 The 'A' category will consist of affluent castes like Yadavs and Ahirs while the 'B' category will be extremely backward with other castes like Kushwaha, Maurya, Shakya, Saini while the most backward castes will be castes like Mallah, Nishad, Carpenter, Lohar
 bijepi ne pichhadi jatiyon ke cote ke alaava dalit jatiyon ke bheetar bhi aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan kaa praavdhaan rakhane kii baat kii he
 That is, the rich castes should be different among the Dalits and the castes which are still marginalized among the Dalits should be given reservation in the category of Dalits by placing them in the category of ultra-dalits
 puri aabaadi main 26% obisi, 21% dalit, 19% agade or 14% musalmaan maane jate hai
 BJP wants to provide reservation within this 26% OBC and 21% Dalit reservation
 baat 2001 main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri rajnath singh ke prayaason kii karen to rajnath ne daliton or pichhadon main har jati ko uski sankhya ke anupaat main aarakshan dene ke liye hukum singh kii adhyakshata main ek cameti banaai thi
 The report of the committee was also passed in the assembly, but Ashok Yadav, a minister in his own government, went to court against it
 court ne is cameti kii report par roak laga di thi
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on 22 March 2018, during the assembly session after the by-election defeat, announced a separate reservation quota for the ultra-dalits and the most backward when needed, announcing the formation of the committee and said that Will consider the issues, it is yet to be decided
 isaki shuruyaat 2001 main tatkaaleen siem rajnath singh ne kii thi jab unhone saamaajik nyaay simiti kii report ke aadhaar par daliton kaa do shreniyan main baanta tha
 Jatavs and Dhusias were placed in first category 'A' and 65 second Dalit castes were placed in second category 'B'
 shrenee 'e' main rakhi gayi jatiyon ko 10% or shrenee 'bi' kii dalit birdariyon ko 11% aarakshan dene kii sifarish kii gai thi
 It may be that the Yogi government should implement this provision as it sees a large section within the Dalits who have become a BJP voter
 There was a recommendation to divide the backward class into three categories
 inkaa kul kota 27% kii bajaay 28% karne kii sifarish kii gai thi
 Yadav and Ahir were placed in the first category 'A'
 is shrenee ke pichhadon ko 5% aarakshan dene kii vakaalat kii gai thi
 Eight backward castes like Jat, Kurmi, Lodh and Gujar were placed in 'B' category and were recommended to give 9% reservation
 'si' category main 70 ati pichhadi birdariyon ko 14% aarakshan kota dene kii baat kahi gai thi
 The bjp's entire eye is focused on this 46% vote bank
 It feels that if it separates the castes like Yadav and Ahir to take votes of other backward castes, then it will come back to power

 VK Singh said that i also wrote a secret letter to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh about the shortage of arms in the army as the army chief
 unhone kaha ki mere us khat ko li kar diya gaya tha or mujhe nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 He also told that at that time a small PMO officer was blown away, now once again the Congress is deliberately emphasizing the issue
 wike singh ne aage kaha ki rafel saude ko lekar koi aadmi agar samajhnaa na chaahe use kitna bhi samajha lo vah vahiin samajhenge
 There are also many advisors in it who dispute everything
 mantri ne kaha ki sarvocch nyaayalay ne is maamle main saaf taur se kah diya he, aise main unhen shanti kerani chahie or desh ke vikaas kii baat kerani chahie
 The Union Minister said that the things which are necessary for the security of the country are taking that thing in a light-hearted manner
 unhone kaha ki airforce ko vimaan kii jarurat he, ladaai hui to desh ko koun bachaayegaa
 VK Singh said that in the last 4 years, the Modi government has made a lot of efforts for the forces, there is a need to improve the process that we have here
 gauratlab he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi rafel mudde par pradhanmantri narendra modi par sidhe taur par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai

 (from input language) madhyapradesh ke panchayat evam gramin vikaas mantri gopal bhargav ne akshay tritiy par yojit samuhik vivaah sammelan main nai naveli dulhanon ko visheshrup se kapade dhone kii mogari bhent di, taaki ve nashe main dhut or sataane vaale patiyon ko isse peet saken
 Under the Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojana, Bhargava gave this gift to about 700 brides who got married in Gadhakota of Rehli assembly constituency of Sagar district yesterday
 is kaarykram main lagbhag 700 jodon kii shaadi karai gai
 The slogan was written on these mogaris, and the police would not speak for the beating of liquor
 bhargav ne bataaya ki jab bhi main apane vidhansabha kshetra main jaataa hum, us dauraan mahilaayein mujhase shikaayat kiya karti hai ki unke patiyon ko sharaab kii lat lagi hui he, jiske kaaran ve na keval apni patniyon ko peetate hai, balki kadi mehnat kar jo thodaa bhi unhone kamaaya he, use bhi unase chin kar sharaab pine ke liye le jate hai
 He said, 'the idea of giving Mogri to the new Navali brides came to my mind when a lady asked me if i can get rid of this problem by beating my husband with Mogri
 bhargav ne bataaya, kyonki ye vichaar mujhe bahut acha laga, isliye maine 10 hajaar mogari banane kaa order de diya, taaki un mahilaon ko ye mogari de sakuun, jo sharaabi pati se pareshaan hai
 Drinking of husbands was causing trouble in their homes
 jiske kai jindagiyaan barbaad ho rahi thi
 He said, the government or police alone cannot diagnose the problem
 iske liye logon ko aage aana hoga
 History is witness that whenever the public intervened to solve a problem, that problem went away
 bhargav ne bataaya ki har pradesh main avaidh sharaab kii bikri ek bada mudda he or iske peeche bade paimaane par sharaab mafia lipt he
 Unless the common people come forward to overcome this problem, it is not easy to rein in it
 unhone kaha ki nai naveli dulhanon ko sharaabi patiyon ko peetane ke liye mogari dena is disha main ek pahal he

 whatsapp finally changed its privacy policy last year
 is policy ke tahat whatsap yugers ke number or ditels fasebuk ke saath share hoga
 Users were given a few days' deferment, but then it was made necessary to express this privacy policy
 iske khilaaf maamla court tak gaya or germany court ne isapar roak laga di
 The petition was filed in the Supreme Court on the data protection of Facebook and whatsapp
 isamen daawa kiya gaya tha ki fasebuk or whatsap par yujar kaa data protect nahin hota he
 Counsel Kapil Sibal has told the court on behalf of whatsapp that the message and voice call and you are endencrypted and the privacy of the users has been taken care of
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah yugers or whotsap kaa contract puri tarah se prived domen main he
 Therefore, constitutionally, this policy cannot be tested by the Supreme Court
 iconomic times kii report ke mutabik fasebuk ke vakil ne is maamle par court me kaha he, ‘jinhen aisa lagata he ki is policy se unke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan ho rahaa he yaa yah policy kharaab he to wo ise chhod sakate hai
 We have given users complete freedom for this, 'additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a five-judge bench headed by Justice Deepak Mishra,' We are bringing in the regulatory system of new data protection
 chunane kii aazaadee ko protect kiya jayega or isamen koi shaq nahin he’yachikakarta kii taraf se vakil harish salve ne kaha kii is naipolicy ke tahat yugers ko naa chaahate hue bhivhatsap or fasebuk ko ijaajat deni hoti he jiske baad whatsap ke maisejon ko fasebuk bhi pard saktaa he
 Facebook has stopped taking whatsapp users' data for the time being in Germany
 Germany's Hamburg data protection commissioner Caspar has said that Facebook has neither sought permission to transfer data from the user nor does it have the consent of the user
 iske khilaaf fasebuk ne court main apil kii, lekin court se company ko niraash haath lagi he
 Facebook had recommended to the Hamburg Administrative Court to ban this order of privacy regulator
 lekin court ne aisa karne se saaf manaa kar diya he
 After this, it is possible that Facebook can now withdraw from its data sharing policy in Germany
 iskaa matlab ye he ki vahaan ke 35 million whatsap yugers ko apana data fasebuk ke saath ke saath share nahin karnaa hoga
 Data protection commissioner Kasper said in a statement, 'good news for millions of people who use whatsapp every day in Germany because it is no longer unhelpful', although Facebook court is preparing to chalk this ruling
 company ne kaha he ki is maamle par regaullation se baatcheet chal rahi he or is dauraan europe main company yugers ke whatsap data nahin le rahi he
 Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's first wife, Najwa bin Laden, was truly his love
 donon pehle se hi ek-duusare ko jaanate the, jabaki apni anya patniyon se laden nikaah ke pehle kabhi nahin mila
 Jean Sessions, who wrote a biography of Laden, has revealed this in his book 'growing up bin Laden: Osama's Wife and Sun Take Us Inside Their Secret World'
 seshan ne ieenes ko bataaya ki najwa laden kii rishtedaar thi or nikaah ke baad use baari mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Especially, he had to make many compromises regarding living
 is pustak kii sah-lekhika najwa bin laden or unka betaa omar bin laden hai, jinhone duniya ke is khoonkhaar aatankwaadi ke jivan se jude kai pahaluon par vistrut jaankaree di
 According to the writer, "laden and Najwa's marriage was based on love and choice
 najwa kii maa laden se uske nikaah ke paksh main nahin thim
 She did not want her daughter to move from Syria to Saudi Arabia
 lekin 15 varshiya yah syrian ladki 17 varshiya rishtedaar laden se prem karti thi
 "najwa had to make many compromises when he went to Saudi Arabia after Nikah
 sabase zyada pareshaani unhen rasoi or bachche sambhaalane main hui
 They had many children one after the other and had to cook for a large family
 upar se laden ne unke dwaara bijli, gas stove or aise hi duusare saamaan ke istemaal par roak laga di thi
 According to the session, "najwa was a good photographer and also loved riding, playing tennis and cycling
 lekin laden kii patni banane ke baad use yah sab chhodana padaa
 "according to the writer, Laden's life remained stable even after he arrived in Afghanistan in 1996
 use pehle gufaaon main or phir roosi sainya thikaane main rahanaa padaa, jahaan bijli bhi nahin thi
 But she remained calm and tried to give the children a good atmosphere at home
 torabora kii pahadiyon main laden ke parivaar ke chhipe rahane ke vakt ke bare main jyaan ne likhaa he, "uske bete ne kabhi aisi jindagi kii kalpana nahin thi
 "according to the writer, Laden's wives were probably influenced by him due to his calm nature and extremely defensive attitude towards him
 laden ne kabhi kisi or ko unke kareeb nahin aane diya
 She was always on screen

 unhone kaha, 'nitish kumaar tad ke ped kii tarah hai, jo kisi ko chaaya nahin de sakate

 kendriya mantri ne kaha kinitish kumaaranaron ke saath kitna bhi poster lagava len, lekin ve mukhyamantri to dur, mukhiya bhi nahin ban sakate

 (input: IANS) The Modi government celebrated one year of the Goods and Services Tax GST, while Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who played a key role in the implementation of GST, and p Chidambaram, who was the finance minister in the former UPA government, were seen on social media
 congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue arun jetali ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ne rajyon ke bich saamanjasy baithaate hue desh main jiesti lagu karne main safalataa hasil kii
 Jaitley claimed that the biggest success of the Modi government is that he has prepared all the states of the country to implement GST, whereas the previous Congress government has completely failed to implement it
 ise dekhen: GST ke raste bhi nahin aayaa ej of duing bijnesagetali ke is bayaan par purv vitt mantri or congress netaa pi chidambaram main kaha ki congress jis ek kaaran se apane kaarykaal ke dauraan jiesti ko lagu nahin kar saki vah he vipaksh main baithi bijepi kaa virodh
 Chidambaram said that there was no consensus on GST till May 2014 due to bjp's opposition
 vahiin 2014 ke baad bani bijepi sarkaar ne congress ne is aarthik sudhaar ko lagu karaane main ahm bhoomika adaa kii
 On Jaitley's statement, Chidambaram took his side by resorting to the tweet
 gauratlab he ki jiesti ke ek saal ke jashn ke dauraan live strimming ke jariye desh ko sambodhit karte hue vitt mantri ne daawa kiya ki jiesti ko lagu kar lenaa hi modi sarkaar kii sabase badi uplabdhi he
 The Modi government has succeeded in bringing together all the states of the country on one platform for this economic reform and this has started a new chapter of cooperative federalism
 ise padhein: jiesti kaa jashnah mukhya samaaroh main shaamil hue do-do vitt mantri!apane sambodhan ke dauraan arun jetali ne kaha ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa prastaav ki vah ek tex dar vaala jiesti dekhnaa chaahate hai vah puri tarah se aswabhaavik he
 It is not possible to implement this in India
 aisa mahaj un deshon main kiya ja saktaa he jahaan puri jansankhya ek jaise aay varg main aati he
 Apart from this, Arun Jaitley while writing a Facebook post again on the occasion of one year of GST, while claiming the success of GST, said that GST formulated by Congress could never be successful in this country
 haalanki jiesti ke ek saal ke maukey par pi chidambaram ne press conference ke jariye kaha ki bijepi sarkaar dwaara lagu kiya gaya jiesti apane prayek swaroop main gadabadi ke saath tha
 Chidambaram said that the BJP government was in such a hurry to implement GST that it itself ignored the advice of its chief economic advisor on tax rates which led to major problems in implementing GST
 dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar (delhi Government) ne varsha jal sanchayan ke liye ek nai yojana taiyaar kii he
 The Delhi government has decided that it will deposit water by digging a pit in the land around the Yamuna river from Palla to Wazirabad in Delhi
 barish kaa jo pani aayega vah gaddhon main jamaa ho jayega
 This will have two advantages: first, that the accumulated water will percolate into the ground so that the water level will rise below the ground, and the Delhi government will provide the people of the capital by clearing the water stored in the pits
 dilli sarkaar (delhi Government) ne payalat project ke tahat faisla kiya he kii pallaa gaanv se lekar wazirabad tak ke 20 kilometre ke yamuna kii aasapaas kii zamin kiraye par lekar usame 2 meter ke gadde kiye jaayenge
 When the rain water rises in the Yamuna, these pits will be filled with water and will be converted into a kind of pond
 talab kaa pani pehle riskar jameen main jayega jisase underground water level badhegaa
 Apart from this, the water that will remain on top will be cleaned and made available for the use of Delhiites

 Congress and BJP have come completely face to face in Karnataka assembly elections
 donon hi dalon ke diggaj netaa ek-duusare par karaara hamalaa bol rahe hai
 The Congress has fielded Rahul Gandhi as well as Sonia Gandhi in the election campaign
 mangalvaar ko bijapur main chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue sonia gandhi ne piem modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah par karaara hamalaa bolaa
 He said that the ghost of Congress-free India is rooted on PM Modi
 sonia gandhi ne kaha ki siddharmaiya sarkaar ne indira canteen shuru kii, jiske tahat 10 rupee main khaanaa miltaa he
 The Modi government at the Center is discriminating against Karnataka
 congress kii siddharmaiya sarkaar ne karnataka ko number van rajya banaaya he
 In a direct attack on PM Modi, Sonia Gandhi said that when the Congress implemented MNREGA to give employment to people across the country, BJP and Modi themselves had protested
 modi ne kisaanon or unke parivaar kaa kiya apmaan: sonyapichley kuch varshon se hamaare anndaata kisaan tamaam kathinaaiyon se jujh rahe hai
 Over the last four years, there has been a drought for decades
 is par piem modi ne madad dena to dur, siem se milane tak se inkaar kar diya
 Modi insulted not only the CM, but also the farmers and their family
 siddharmaiya ne 22 lakh kisaanon ke karj kiye mafpurv congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki hairaani kii baat yah bhi he ki jin rajyon main sookhaa padaa, un rajyon ko modi sarkaar ne hajaaron-hajaar karod die
 But sprinkled salt on the wounds of the people of Karnataka did nothing
 kya yahi he modi kaa 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas'
 Despite this, Siddaramaiah waived the debts of 22 lakh farmers to get the farmer brothers out of this trouble
 sonia boleen- modi par congress mukt bharat kaa bhoot chadha haiunhone kaha ki congress sarkaar lagaataar vikaas kaa kaam kar rahi he, jabaki modi sarkaar inako khatm karne kaa kaam kar rahi he
 Modi has a passion for Congress-free India
 
 
 congress mukt bharat kaa bhoot laga he
 
 
 
 congress mukt bharat to chhodie wo apane saamne kisi ko bardaasht nahin kar sakate
 'pet does not fill with speech' Sonia said that Modi is proud that he gives a good speech
 wo ek bade orietter or abhinayta kii tarah hai
 If his speech can fill the nation's stomach, then he should give more speech
 modi ke bhaashan se pet nahin bhar saktaa, rojgaar nahin mil saktaa or kisaanon ko raahat va suvidhaayen nahin mil saktin
 All of this requires strong intentions
 petrol, dijal or gas kii keemton main ho rahaa lagaataar ijafis dauraan sonia ne mahangaai ke masale par bhi modi sarkaar par aade haathon liya
 He said that today inflation is touching the sky
 samaaj ke har tabake ko museebataan jhelni pad rahi hai
 Perhaps this has never happened before, but irrespective of all this, the Modi government is continuously increasing the prices of petrol, diesel and domestic gas
 mahapurushon kaa raajnneeti ke liye istemaal kar rahe modih sonyamodi ke hamale par palatwaar karte hue sonia ne kaha ki desh yah dekhakar hairat main he ki piem jahaan bhi jate hai, vahaan galat bolte hai
 Great freedom fighters use politics as chess pieces
 kya aisi baat karnaa ek piem ko shobhaa detaa he? kya pehle kabhi aisa piem dekha, jo sirf bate hi karata he or asli mudde par khamosh rahata he
 Sonia fired many questions on PM Modi Meanwhile, Sonia also fired many questions on PM Modi
 unhone poocha ki modi ne janata se chaar saal pehle kiye vaadon main se koun sa vaada puraa kiya? itane samay main desh ke kisaanon, yuvaaon, madhyam varg, mahilaon, bacchiyon, daliton or pichhadon ke liye aapane kya kiya?unhone sawaal kiya ki karpshan mitaane ke aapke sabase pasandida vaade kaa kya hua? chaar saal baad bhi aakhirkaar lokapal kyon nahin laayaa gaya? modi karpshan mitaane ke liye karnataka main jo manch par ird-gird rahete hai, unka model apanaayenge yaa phir apane sabase kareebi saathi ke bete kaa model apanaayenge
 Two years later, Sonia Gandhi went out to campaign, Sonia Gandhi went to road show in PM Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi on August 3, 2016, before the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections

 kol drops hone par graahakon ko muaavja dene ke dilli hai court ke aadesh ke kilaaf telecom companiyon ko supreme court se raahat mili he
 The Supreme Court has said that TRAI should revisit the compensation formula once again
 pehali najar main lag rahaa he ki tri ne muaavje ke aadesh ko jari karte hue takneekee paksh par zyada gaur nahin kiya
 In the call drop case, the mobile service provider companies had said in the Supreme Court that mobile companies are not responsible for the call drop
 kol drops hone ke peeche kai kaaran hai
 These include cases such as mobile phones used by consumers, distance from mobile towers and tunnels or jammed areas or cable disconnection of mobile companies
 ye maamla bijli kii tarah nahin balki radio wave par aadhaarit he
 At the same time, corporations are sealing towers of companies, which are increasing the call drop, while on the other hand, TRAI is issuing orders to give compensation to companies
 companiyon kii ore se kaha gaya ki duniya main aisa koi desh nahin jahaan kol drops na hota ho
 Colombia is the only country where call drop is fined
 tippaniyan Everywhere in the world an average of 2 to 5 percent call drop is considered
 bharat main yah 2 fisadi he
 When 2% is acceptable then why are we being fined
 darasal hoicourt ne telecom companiyon kii ore se daayar yachika ko khaarij karte hue kaha tha ki unhen kol drop hone par graahakon ko muaavja dena hi hoga
 The High Court said that companies will have to pay this compensation to their consumers from January 1, 2016
 tri ne 16 oktober 2015 ko aadesh jari kiya tha ki telecom sarvice companiyaan, agar kol drops hota he to 1 rupaya upabhokta ko bataur muaavja dengi jo ek din main 3 rupee ho saktaa he
 Mobile companies had filed a petition in the Delhi High Court against this
 companiyon kii daleel thi ki tri kaa ye aadesh manamaana or gaiyrkanoonee he, ise radd kiya jaae
 At first glance, it seems that TRAI did not pay much attention to the technical aspect while issuing the compensation order
 kol drops maamle main mobile sarvice prowider companiyon ne supreme court main kaha tha ki kol drops ke liye mobile companiyaan jimmedaar nahin hai
 There are many reasons behind the call drop
 inamen upabhoktaaon ke dwaara istemaal kiye gaye mobile phone, mobile tower se duuri or surang yaa phir jaimar lage aria yaa phir mobile companiyon ke cabel katane jaise maamle jimmedaar hai
 This case is not based on radio wave but like electricity
 vahiin nigam companiyon ke tower sil kar raheen hai jo kol drop ko badha raheen hai to duusari taraf tri companiyon par muaavja dene ke aadesh jari kar rahaa he
 It was said by the companies that there is no country in the world where there is no call drop
 colombia ekmaatr aisa desh he jahaan kol drop par jurmaana lagaaya jaataa he
 The comments duniya main har jagah 2 se 5 fisadi kol drops kaa ausat mana jaataa he
 It is 2% in India
 jab 2 fisadi sweekaarya he to ham par ye jurmaana kyon lagaaya ja rahaa he
 In fact, the High Court had rejected the petition filed by the telecom companies, saying that they would have to pay compensation to the customers if the call drops
 hoicourt ne kaha ki companiyon ko apane upabhoktaaon ko yah muaavja 1 janvari 2016 se dena hoga
 TRAI issued an order on 16 October 2015 that the telecom service companies, if the call drops, will pay 1 rupee as compensation to the consumer, which can be 3 rupees in a day
 iske khilaaf mobile companiyon ne dilli hoicourt main yachika daayar kii thi
 Companies argued that this order of TRAI is arbitrary and illegal, it should be canceled

 ''WB main ek Dr ko 200 “rohingya “ pitayee karte hai to thik lekin WB ke Dr iske virodh main strike kare or samarthan main puure desh ke doctor aa jaae to galat ?? ye kya hai ? saare dalo ko saanp soongh gaya !!ek Dr Harshvardhan ke alaava sab maun hai kyon ? ek doctor or naagarik ke naate meraa samarthan halekin shuukravaar ko ek baar phir alok kaa baagi tevar jari rahaa
 He once again tweeted that nowhere matches the official line of the party
 alok ne likhaa, ''pashchim bengal main ek doctor ko 200 'rohingya' pitayee karte hai to thik lekin pashchim bengal ke doctor iske virodh main strike kare or samarthan main puure desh ke doctor aa jaae to galat? ye kya hai? saare dalon ko saanp soongh gaya
 a dr harshavardhan ke alaava sab maun hai kyon? ek doctor or naagarik ke naate meraa samarthan hai?''jaankaron kaa maananaa hai ki alok darasal bhaajapa main janaa chaahate hai
 Therefore, from now on he is making a role that the party should suspend him so that he can join the BJP by becoming a hero

 As you all know that in today's smartphone review we do not trust the benchmark much
 ham smartphone ko asal jindagi main istemaal karke test karte hai
 This is because if a customer buys a smartphone, he does not have any tools to test it or he does not need the support of benchmark

 The design is good and in using such smartphones, you will not feel that you are using this budget device

 This smartphone has 4GB RAM, it helps to make the smartphone fast

 Switching from one app to another is easy
 brownjing fast he
 Many apps can be used simultaneously
 becoground main kai eps chal rahe hon phir bhi aaraam se aap kai eps yuj kar sakate hai
 Overall, if you look at the price in terms of performance, then this smartphone is better in this case
 hai and smartphone kii tarah isamen bhi nae varjan kaa Asphalt chalaa sakate hai lag nahin hoga
 However, after gaming for a long time, you may have problems, the phone is slightly warm

 Bezel lace display is the trend of smartphones and hence this smartphone is on that trend only
 disple rejolushan echdi plus he or isliye shandaar lagata he
 Especially if you watch movies or videos on mobile, then this smartphone meets your expectations for this
 is smartphone main 2
 The 5D curved display panel has been used
 iskaa vuing angal kaaphi behatar he
 The color temperature is also correct, but there may be some difficulty in the sun and could have been improved
 kul disple main koi eks factor nahin he, lekin phir bhi yah aam istemaal ke liye behatar he
 Camarakompany has greatly highlighted its camera during the launch
 is price range main dual camera seoup dena saraahniy he
 It has 16 megapixels and 2 megapixel lenses
 phase ditection autofocus bhi diya gaya he
 For the selfie, it has an 8-megapixel front camera and features of beautification are also provided
 camera parformens kii baat karen to aam tau par log do camaron vaala smartphone isliye lete hai, kyonki unhen diesalaar jaisi tasviren yani becoground bler karke chahie hoti hai
 The images clicked with Honor 7X are good to see with the depth effect and the background is blurred as well
 lekin kai baar becoground sahit subject ke kinare bhi aapako bler milegaa
 Photos with the bokeh effect look beautiful, but many times it is not accurate

 Photos are sharp and look good

 But if you clicked after giving a little time, then the photo gets clicked properly

 In addition, it has an ultra mode for power saving, which can be used to enable the last battery to be breathed out
 company kaa daawa he ki yah 1 din se zyada chalegi
 Generally the claims of companies have proved to be hollow, but this phone does not have this
 bydaree ko lekar hamaara anubhav acha rahaa he or mixd yuj main ek din chal jaataa he or thodi bydaree bachi bhi rahati he
 If its display is large, you will take care of this, then you will find its battery even better, because such a display usually consumes more battery
 aaj tak reating - 4 / 5 The Delhi High Court has issued notices to 3 major hospitals in Delhi on a contempt petition filed against patients of EWS category for not receiving treatment in private hospitals
 in aspataalon main moolchand hospital,saint stephens hospitalor rajeev gandhi cancer hospital shaamil he
 Explain that on July 9 this year, the Supreme Court ordered
 jiske mutabik, sarkaar se jameen lekar banaae gaye privet aspataalon koidbluescategory ke logon ko 25 fisadi opidi or 10 fisadi bistar muft dene kii baat kahi gai thi
 But there were constant complaints about these three hospitals that they are refusing to give free treatment to patients of EWS category
 jiske baad enjio soshal jurist kii taraf se hycourt meshvamananayachika daakhil kii gai
 a similar order was given to private hospitals in the Delhi High Court in 2007 before the Supreme Court, but the order of the High Court was challenged by some private hospitals in the Supreme Court
 iske baad is saal supreme court ne bhi is maamle main faisla aspataalon ke khilaaf diya
 At present there are 57 such private hospitals in Delhi, which were given land by the government to build hospitals at concessional rates
 dilli hoicourtis maamle kii agali sunwaayee ab 23 oktober ko karegaa
 On the other hand, on notice of contempt petition, these three private hospitals will have to file their reply in the court
 in teenon aspataalon main kul milakar kareeb ek hajaar se zyada bistar hai or uske 10 fisadi ke hisaab se 100 bed garibon ko ilaaj ke liye milane chahie, jo philhal ye aspataal dene se manaa kar rahe he
 Although this meeting is not an official initiative by the government, but Ram Madhav's presence here is considered very important
 gauratlab he ki ram madhav or pidipi ke divangat netaa mufti mohammad said ne milakar rajya sarkaar ke gathbandhan agenda ke anubandh ko taiyaar kiya tha
 The agreement showed continued dialogue with Pakistan and a commitment to dialogue with all partners, including the Hurriyat Conference
 gauratlab he ki kareeb ek maheene ke andar ghati main hui hinsak gatividhiyon main 50 se zyada log maare gaye hai or 3000 se zyada ghayal hue hai
 Due to the continuous curfew, normal life is disturbed and mobile internet service has also come to a standstill
 yahaan algaavvaadiyon ne band kaa elaan kar rakhaa he or kuch report ke mutabik aatanki netaaon ne bhi rajya main vibhinn reliyaan yojit kii hai
 Significantly, in about a month, more than 50 people have been killed and more than 3000 injured in violent activities in the valley

 Separatists have declared a bandh here and according to some reports, terrorist leaders have also organized various rallies in the state
 khaadya suraksha bill par upie sarkaar kii hadabadi ke baad yah kamobesh tay ho chukaa he ki congress samay se pehle loksabhaa chunaav karavaaegi
 If sources are to be believed, the government is once again preparing to win the election by showing 67 per cent poor people a lollipop for free food
 kaha ja rahaa he ki monsoon seshan ko november se pehle nahin bulaayaa jayega or seshan bulaane ke baad ahm bilon ko peshkar loksabhaa bhang kii sifarish kar di jaaegi
 The BJP and the Samajwadi Party were already anticipating this
 apane dar ko nae sire se aawaaj dete hue guuruuvaar ko loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne twit kiya ki itani jaldi kyon? kya ve jaldi chunaav to nahin karaane vaale?iske baad sushamaa ne sansadeey paramparaon kii duhai dete hue congress ko kosa he ki yah adhyadesh kaa tarika sansad kii avmaananaa karata he
 On the other hand, the Samajwadi Party on which the UPA is based on crutches, is also repeatedly talking about the Lok Sabha elections
 sapa supremeo mulaayam singh yadav ne kai baar saarvajanik rup se kaha he ki 2013 main hi loksabhaa chunaavon kaa elaan ho jayega
 With this belief, the Samajwadi Party is now in the world, in terms of strategy, what is the issue and time when the withdrawal of support from the UPA is announced
 haalanki kuch rajnatik pandit yah bhi kayaas laga rahe hai ki congress atal bihari vaajapeyi kii 2004 kii galati nahin doharayega or apana kaarykaal puraa karke hi chunaav main jaaegi
 Significantly, Vajpayee, excited by the electoral victory of some states and if the discussions were to be held, under the pressure of TDP leader Chandrababu Naidu, announced the general elections a few months ahead of schedule
 kaha ja rahaa he ki espi ke samarthan waapas lene kii sthiti main sarkaar ko jediu se bahari samarthan milane kaa bharosa he
 That is why Congress is adopting an aggressive attitude on the Food Security Bill
 game plan ye he ki jis tarah se 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke pehle manaregaa skim or rin maafee ke jariye garibon ke voton kii fasal ekamusth kaati gai thi, usee tarah se is baar khaanaa khilaakar vot vasula jaae
 Since the issue is related to the poor, no opposition party is even able to directly oppose it
 bijepi agar magar kar rahi he, to espi kisaanon ke hiton kii dhafali baja rahi he
 Amidst all this, there is a legitimate complaint from the opposition that when such Acts are already in force in many states, then what is the UPA taking credit for
 jald chunaavon ke kayaas ke peeche ek andeshaa vidhansabha main patkhni milane par nakaaratmak nateezon kaa bhi he
 In the states where elections are to be held later this year, the defeat of Congress in Rajasthan and Delhi is considered more or less fixed
 pichley loksabhaa chunaavon main in rajyon main congress kaa shandaar pradarshan rahaa tha
 Apart from this, in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the Congress is not considering its election prospects very well
 aise main congress ke political manager ye tark de rahe hai ki vidhansabha chunaavon main haar ke chalate hone vaali harakiri se bachane or lahar ko apane paksh main karne kaa yahi behatar mauka he

 This upper class writes nonsense blogs, performs poems etc

 According to Abdul, this class hardly worships anyone
 haalanki maulaviyon ko apane varg main kisi bhi anya jati se kisi ke aane ke aane se koi dikkat nahin he
 Army, industrialists and zamindars come in the top class
 is varg kii dilchaspee keval videshi vittiya evam hathiyaar nirmaan sansthaanon ke laabh main he
 He is interested only in industries such as defense, housing societies, golf courses and textile mills

 RT To Show Your Love— EFSENA (@efsenarocks)june 29, 2015input: IANS The new responsibilities given to Kumar Vishwas at the Political Affairs Committee (PAC) meeting, held at Arvind Kejriwal's house, have pacified the quarrels of the Aam Aadmi Party
 lekin abhi bhi bada sawaal yah he ki kya ye shanti, kisi tufaan ke aane se pehle kii he
 Because the purpose of the 3-hour PAC meeting of AAP leaders was to end the current controversy
 manish sisodiya kaa amanatullah khan ke ghar janaam aadmi party ke sutron ke mutabik political afaire kamity main sabase pehle vidhayak amanatullah khan ke us vivaadit bayaan par charchaa hui, jahaan khan ne kumaar vishwaas ko bijepi kaa agent bataaya tha
 After discussion, a committee was formed, which decided to suspend Amanatullah, who would investigate Khan's statement
 lekin is karrwai ke baad manish sisodiya kaa amanatullah khan ke ghar janaa, kumaar vishwaas ko zarur khatak saktaa he, kyonki wo amanatullah ke bayaan ke peeche party ke kisi bade chehre kii shankaa jataa chuke hai
 Kumar Vishwas had taken charge of Rajasthan and came to the Khushpolitical Affair Committee with a long list of his demands
 sutron ke mutabik kumaar vishwaas rajasthan kaa prabhaar paakar khush hai kyonki wo khud ye pad chaahate the
 In fact, when the Aam Aadmi Party was formed after the movement, apart from Kumar Vishwas, many big leaders took control of the government and also took charge of different states
 is baat ko kumaar vishwaas lagaataar dekh rahe the, samaj rahe the
 After this, the situation within the party deteriorated so much that Kumar Vishwas's displeasure became known
 yahi vajah he ki piesi kii baithak ke baad 'aap' political afaire kamity ke tamaam muskuraate chehron ke bich kumaar vishwaas kaa udhaas cheharaa, aane vaale dinon main kisi bade vivaad kaa sanket ho saktaa he
 Kumar Vishwas will support every issue of nationalism
 Aam Aadmi Party chief also did not like to question Kumar Vishwas on the surgical strike
 sutron ke mutabik yahi vajah thi kii political afaire kamity kii baithak main is baat par bhi charchaa hui, kii rashtrawaad ke mudde par party virodh nahi karegi
 This was the reason Kumar Vishwas refused to apologize on his video
 baithak ke dauraan charchaa hui kii kumaar vishwaas rashtrawaad ke har mudde kaa samarthan karenge jiskaa virodh party nahi karegi
 Questions that can increase the difficulty of top leadership of Aam Aadmi Party 1
 kya tikat bantbare ko lekar uthe bhrashtachar ke sawaalon par ection hua?2
 Is Kumar Vishwas's sadness a conspiracy against him within the party? 3
 kya vidhayakon or kaaryakartaaon ke do dhadon main bantane se pehle kejariwal sthati ko sambhaal paaenge?emsidi chunaav se das din pehle 14 april ko kumaar vishwaas ne ek video jari kar aam aadmi party ke bheetar chal rahe bhrashtachar kaa zikr karte hue, arvind kejariwal par hi sawaal khadey kar die the
 According to sources, in the Political Affairs Committee held on Wednesday, it was decided that instead of bashing the opposing parties, the Aam Aadmi Party will take action so that a strong message can be passed between the workers and the public
 haalanki is mudde par vistrut charchaa nahi hui
 The question arises as to whether the PAC meeting discussed how to re-engage the activists with the party so that the previous electoral defeat is not repeated
 philhal sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki arvind kejariwal ne kumaar vishwaas kii sharton ke aage jhukkar party main damege control to kar liya, lekin kya aam aadmi party kaa andruni vivaad khatm ho gaya he? kya amanatullah khan khamosh baith jaaenge, yaa phir kejariwal kumaar vishwaas ke bayanon ko bhul jaaenge
 The answers to many such questions are yet to be found
 haalanki is vivaad se do hisson main bantate nazar aae 'aap' vidhayakon ko ekajute karnaa, philhal arvind kejariwal ke liye sabase badi chunauti ho gai hai
 The conflict between India and China has been increasing for a long time
 sikkim ke paas doklam main border par donon deshon kii senaayen aamane-saamne hai, to vahiin apane sarkari akhbaar ke jariye china bhi aae din gidadbhabhaki de rahaa he
 China says that India should withdraw its army from the border
 vahiin chini akhbaar ne apane artical main saaf taur par likhaa he ki china bharat se kisi bhi tarah ke sangharsh ke liye taiyaar he
 By intimidating India and threatening war, China wants to give many messages to the whole world
 1
 Hachina, the singular superpower of Asia, has grown rapidly in the last few decades, whether it is the issue of economy or military power
 lekin pichley ek dashak main bharat bhi ek badi shakti ke rup main ubhara he, piem modi lagbhag apane har bhaashan main kehete hai ki puri duniya kii najar asia par he or asia main bhi bharat par sabhi kii najare hai
 China wants to show pressure on India to show that it is the only superpower in Asia and will try to prove India as a dwarf
 2
 Not only a strong message to the opposing countries in the South China Sea, China has strong relations with its 14 neighboring countries
 dakshin china sagar ke mudde par china ko duniya ke kai bade deshon kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Many big countries including the US, Japan and India have given advice to China on this issue
 mangalvaar ko hi bharat or dakshin china sagar main china ke adiyal ravaiye ke bich america or australia ne china kii badhati raajnneetik or sainya mahatvakankshaon ko lekar chetaya he
 While the top Pentagon commander has opposed the Chinese move to establish dominance over the South China Sea, Australia has dominated China in the Asia Pacific
 3
 No one hindered economic interests (OBOR was hindered by India) India is the biggest obstacle in Chinese President Xi Jinping's dream project One Belt, One Road
 china ke is project kaa kuch hissaa pakistan adhikrut kashmir se hokar gujarata he, jisapar bharat ko aapatti he
 Many countries have come with him on India's objection
 jab OBOR ko launch kiya gaya tha to nyote ke baavjood bhi bharat kaa koi pratinidhi vahaan nahin gaya tha
 This Chinese project will directly connect China with Europe
 china ko bharat ko chota dikhaa kar yah sandesh dena chahta he ki agar uske raste main koi aata he to uskaa kaaphi asar hoga
 4
 america gherebandi or trump kii niti ko sidhi chunautamerica raashtrapati donald trump har morche par china kaa virodh karte najar aae hai
 The US has consistently stood with India, Japan on the issue of China
 china apni takat kaa ehsaas karakar america ko jawaab dena chahta he
 Trump's US First policy also shocks China's economic dream
 bharat par kadaa rukh apanaakar china sidhe taur par america kaa khuli chunauti dene kii koshish kar rahaa he
 The Trump administration has also approved the sale of arms to Taiwan's arch-rival Taiwan
 trump prashasan ke bharat ke saath bhi achche rishte hai
 In such a situation, China wants to send a message to the US by increasing tension on the border
 5
 Xi Jinping's strictness in internal politics has to be shown
 In 2013, Xi Jinping, who held the post of Chinese President, will again give his presentation on the platform of the Communist Party before 2018
 unhen party ke saamne kiye gaye vaadon or china kii majboot chhavi ke liye kiye ja rahe kaam ko dikhaanaa he
 In 2013, when Jinping was riding on this post, he had a goal of making China a superpower in his agenda
 saath hi china ke border or aarthik takat ke vistaar kaa khaakaa bhi khinchaa tha
 Now in 2018, when Jinping presents his claim for the post again, he would like to tell how much progress China has made during his tenure, and has strengthened the image of China
 isliye bhi china padosi deshon ke saath sakhti kaa rukh dikhaane kii koshish kar rahaa he

 Najma Heptulla met with minority leaders in Mumbai on Saturday
 darasal vah mumbai main rashtriya alpsankhyak vikaas evam vittiya praadhikaran or moulana azaad neshnal academy for skills ke kaaryakramon kii dekharekh ke liye ain thi
 Under the Maulana Azad National Academy for Skills, the central government has targeted to provide jobs to 10,000 youth by 31 March 2015
 lekin baithak ke dauraan vishay maharashtra main muslim or maratha aarakshan ke mudde par mud gaya
 Last month, the state government introduced the Maratha Reservation Bill in the Legislative Assembly, but it first spoke of legal consultation on the Muslim Reservation Bill
 darasal congress-ensipi sarkaar ne vidhansabha chunaavon se ain pehle maratha or muslim aarakshan kaa vaayada kiya tha
 on this alpsankhyak maamalon kii mantri hepatulla ne kaha, 'agar congress sarkaar vaaki muslamaanon ko aarakshan dena chaahati, to vah das saalon tak intazaar nahin karti, unhone chunaav se mahaz 2 maheene pehle iske bare main elaan kiya
 
 
 While he was well aware that he was about to lose the election
 kya alpsankhyak unke is paitaren par bharosa karenge
 ' unhone yah bhi kaha ki ye sarkaar vaayade nahin balki kaam kar rahi he
 We are making minorities capable of doing something for themselves and not be tempted by reservations
 dharm ke aadhaar par aarakshan puri tarah galat he or ye nahin hona chahie
 Najma Heptulla, however, refused to take any questions on the disputed homecoming, saying the matter was not related to her ministry

 About 22 years ago, on 12 March 1993, 12 blasts hit Mumbai's chest in just two hours and 12 minutes
 in silsilewar dhamaakon ke baad jab dhuen kaa gubaar chanta to puure shahar main 257 laashon ke bich kareeb 700 log buree tarah karaah rahe the
 The face of the perpetrators of the terrorist attack was exposed in the face of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and his operatives, while the turn is now the final outcome of Yakub Memon, the biggest planter of the Mumbai blasts
 begunaahon ko maut baantne vaale yaqub ko faansee par latakaae jane kaa din mukarrar ho chukaa he
 With this the countdown of his death has begun
 30 july 2015 ko mumbai serial blast ke gunahagaaron main se ekayaqub memnakaa wo anjaam hone ja rahaa he, jiskaa intjaar hindustan ko puure 22 varshon se he
 The order to hang Yakub Abdul Razzaq Sememiyu alias Yakub Memon at 7 pm in Nagpur Jail has become the day after the order of the person sitting on the highest chair of India's largest court
 police kii jaanch, suraag or sachchhaimumbai ko 12 jagahon se lahooluhaan karne vaale in dhamaakon ke baad mauka-e-vaardaat se suraag ikattha karne se lekar iske gunahagaaron ko anjaam tak pahunchane kaa ye kaam police or adaalat ke liye koi aasaan nahin tha
 However, clues were found and the investigation progressed, and soon the two faces were also exposed in the light of truth, out of whose mind this dreadful conspiracy had come out
 inamen ek tha, anderworld don or di company kaa mukhiya daaud ibrahim to doosraa tha uskaa kareebi or di company kaa leftinent tiger memon
 It is another matter that by the time the police came to know about Tiger Memon and Dawood Ibrahim, both had gone away from the border of India
 mumbai police ne is silsile main kul 129 logon ke khilaaf mukademe kii shuruyaat kii, jinamein se aakhirkaar sau logon ko gunahagaar qaraar diya gaya
 Among these hundred people, one name was Tiger Memon's brother and the most educated man of the Memon family, Yakub Memon
 haalanki, mumbai dhamaakon ke baad yaqub bhi hindustan se nikal bhaagane waalon main shaamil tha, lekin aage chalakar nepali police ne use kathmandu airport se dhar dabocha
 After this, Yakub Memon was also prosecuted along with many other members of the Memon family, but in the light of the investigation, there was so much splash of innocent blood on Yakub's hand that finally the special TADA court of Mumbai gave him the punishment of punishment and the same punishment But on 21 March 2013, where the Supreme Court gave its approval, the President also rejected the mercy application made by Memon after this Supreme Court decision
 Received
 training ke liye bheja pakistanye yaqub memon hi tha jisane dhamaakon kii training ke liye di company ke gurgon ko pakistan bheja
 It was Yakub Memon who arranged the gunpowder for the blasts and it was Yakub Memon who turned the streets of Mumbai red from the innocence
 mumbai dhamaake ko 22 lambey saal guzarane ke baavjood inamen do to ab bhi hindustani sarhad or hindustan ke kanoon se milon dur hai, lekin teesraa or is hamale kaa sabase bada planter ab apane anjaam tak pahunchnewala he
 With the involvement of the Memon family in the blasts, the police started searching for Yakub along with other people of this family
 lekin un dinon wo pakistan main tha, magar baad main use nepal se giraftaar kar liya
 After this, the sections under which Yakub was prosecuted and as the hands of the police against him proved to be a nail in his coffin
 gunahon kii fehrist or sajamumbai bam dhamaakon main yaqub memon ko aapraadhik sajeesh rachane kaa gunahagaar paaya gaya
 This was the section, due to which the court sentenced him to death
 memon ne hi east-west travels ke jariye un mujarimon ke liye aslhe kharide or hawaii tikat book karwaae, jinhen dhamaakon kii training ke liye pakistan bheja gaya
 Not only this, he also arranged for these criminals to live and stay in Pakistan and also bought vehicles in which bomb was planted at different places in Mumbai
 is gunaah main use umr kaid kii sajaa mili
 Yakub was also found guilty of arranging arms and gunpowder and transporting them to other criminals, and was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment in the crime
 aage padhein, kaise ek scooter ne khole saare rajadipressant kaa marij he yakubadhamaakon ke liye gola-barood jamaa karne ke jurm main yaqub par explosive act kii dhaaraon ke tahat bhi mukadmaa chalaa or isamen use 10 saal ke kaid kii sajaa hui
 However, Yakub became a patient of depression after being convicted as a criminal in such a crime
 jisaki binah par uske vakeelon ne uske liye raham kii bheekh bhi maangi, lekin kanoon ne uski aisi har fariyaad ansuni kar di
 An unclaimed scooter became an important clue that was the first terrorist attack of its kind in the country
 ek aisa hamalaa jisane naa sirf saikadon begunaahon kii jaan le lee, balki puure hindustan ko hilaa diya
 Apparently, the Mumbai Police was also the first tactic to investigate such a case
 lekin ek scooter kii surat main mili suraag ne ek hi jatke main sara cese khol diya
 For the first time the country was hit by such a terrible attack that bled Mumbai
 yahaan tak dilli tak ko bhi is vaardaat ke baad harakat main aana padaa
 Three teams were formed for the investigation
 ek team tab ke disipi rakesh maaria kii, duusari team duusare tatkaaleen disipi arup patnayak kii or teesri khud tatkaaleen police kamishnar eyes samara kii
 48 hours had passed since this serial blast, when the Mumbai Police Control Room at half past noon received the news of an abandoned scooter in Dadar area
 police fouran maukey par pahunchati he or use pataa chalata he ki scooter ke andar kareeb 15 kilo ardex chupa he jo ittefaq se fat nahin sakaa
 Police are also investigating the scooter when the police come to know of an unclaimed Maruti van in the Worli area and this van contains a large number of hand grenades, ammo and AK-47 rifles
 maaruti vine ne pahunchaaya memon ke gharregistration number se pataa chalata he ki maaruti vine mumbai ke mahim ilaake ke dargah rod par al-husaini building main rahane vaali kisi rubina suleman memon ke naam par registerd he
 In fact, this was the first clue the police found against the Memon family
 rubina mumbai anderworld ke don tiger memon ke bade bhai suleman kii patni thi
 The police team immediately reaches Rubina's house in search of clues, but the house was locked
 poochtacha karne par pataa chalaa ki puraa memon parivaar 12 march yani dhamaake ke roj hi subah kii flite se dubai chalaa gaya
 On the day of the exact blast, the entire family leaving the country together was raising suspicion
 lekin dhire-dhire tafteesh yaheen se aage badi or dhire-dhire saare chehre benakaab ho gaye
 Team India is to go on a long tour of South Africa next year, but before that an important information has been revealed
 darasal, yah daura pehle saal 2018 kii shuruyaat main ho rahaa tha
 But now a decision will be taken on extending the dates of this tour soon
 aisa isliye kyonki, srilanka board ne bisisiai se yah guzarish kii he ki vah south africa daure ko aage ke liye sthagit karke srilanka main hone vaali tri siries ko pehle karavaaen
 The tri-series was to be held in March first, but after this request, the BCCI has considered furthering the African tour
 bisisiai ke siio rahul johari ne ek nijee agency se bharat ke south africa daure ko lekar kaha, south africa daura bana rahegaa
 The tour can be dated back and forth, but will be a full tour
 jahaan bharat test, vanade or tii-20 siries khelegi or is baat par bisisiai kii muhar lag chuki he
 The Indian team will currently play odis and T20 matches after winning the Test series in Sri Lanka
 uske baad bhartiya team 23 antarrashtriya maichon ke saath ek lambey gharelu daure main vyast hogi
 During this time she will play ODI and T20 series against Australia, New Zealand, and the whole series against Sri Lanka
 bisisiai ne gharelu daure ke baad south africa daure par muhar lagaai thi, lekin ab srilankai board kii independence cap kii darkhwaast ke baad bisisiai ne south africa daure ko aage ke liye sthagit karne kaa vichaar banaaya he
 The Indian team is playing cricket continuously against Srilka
 philhal bhartiya team ne srilanka ko srilanka main 3-0 se test siries haraa diya he
 After this, Team India will now play 5 odis and one T20 match
 srilankai team november main bharat daure par aegi
 Where she will play 3 Tests, 5 odis and 3 T20 matches and now after this news comes, both these countries will also participate in the TRAI series, which is going to be decided in the beginning of 2018
