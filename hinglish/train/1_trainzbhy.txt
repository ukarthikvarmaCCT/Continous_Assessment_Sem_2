 The story that the writer narrates in the film, the audience gets to see it on screen
 yani film kaa nerative kahanikar ke jariye aage badhata he
 It is also necessary to mention here that 'arjun Patiala' is a kind of spoof on the film industry itself
 'arjuna patiala (arjun Patiala)' kii kamiyon kii baat karen to jaisaa maine kaha kii ye film duusari filmon par spoof he
 But when its story moves forward, this spoof is left behind and it seems a forceful comedy film, that is, it has a story name and the script is loose
 ek or baat arjuna patiala kaa nerrative yani riter ke kahani sunaane ke saath film kaa aage badhanaa darshakon ko iske saath judane nahin detaa
 Let me tell you that out of all the films made on the second movie till date, very few have got success
 haalanki, arjuna patiala usee list main shamil hogi yaa behatar pradarshan karegi yah vakt tay karegaa
 But talking about the merits of 'arjun Patiala', its quality is Diljit Dosanjh and Kriti Sanon, whose performances keep the audience tied to the film
 haalanki, abhinay ke maamle main sirf ye do hi nahin balki ronit roy, seemaa paahwa or varun sharma ne bhi damdaar pradarshan kiya he
 Apart from this, some moments and some dialogues of the film manage to make people laugh
 vahiin, arjuna patiala ke gane thik hai or logon ko bhi pasand aa sakate hai
 In such a situation, it can be said that it was not an out of box film and from my side it was 2
 5 stars hai

 The matter was resolved by Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis after talks with MNS chief Raj Thackeray and Karan Johar
 ab is par bollywood star farhaan akhtar ne apni raay rakhi
 Farhan Akhtar considered it unfortunate
 ek angreji akhbaar se hui baatcheet main unhone kaha ki sarkaar bhi nahin kahati ki aapako kya karnaa chahie or kya nahin, to yahaan aap kiski baat sun rahe hai? aap unki baaten sun rahe hai, jo aapako dhamka rahaa he?unhone yah bhi kaha ki ab jab aapako hinsa kii dhamkee mil rahi he to yah sirf aapke bare main nahin he
 That threat is also for your home and family
 unhone yah sawaal bhi kiya ki aap india aurapakistanke bich har saal honevaale kareeb 2 arab dollar ke bijness ko kyon nahin rokte?padhein: box offis par koun luutegaa dil 'shivaay' yaa 'i dil he mushkil'
 
 
 Let us tell you that before Farhan, Shabana Azmi had said on this matter, 'what a sad situation
 mukhyanmatri sauda karte hai, deshbhakti kharidne ke liye mukhyamantri paanch karod rupee kaa sauda karte hai
 Let me tell you that in the past, the Chief Minister met MNS President Raj Thackeray and the film team, after which it was decided that no filmmaker should take Pakistani actors in their films, otherwise they will have to pay a compensation of 5 crores, which is an army welfare fund
 Will go in padhein: Confirmed: pakistan main nahin dikhaai jaaengi 'i dil he mushkil' or 'shivaay'uri aatanki hamale ke baad se kuch raajnneetik partiyaan pakistani kalakaaron kaa virodh kar rahi thim
 MNS had said that it would not allow any such film to be released in Maharashtra in which Pakistani artists have worked
 'i dil he mushkil' main bhi paak kalakaar fawaad khan ne ek mahatvapurn kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 Hence MNS was opposing the release of the film

 Like the congress-ncp in Maharashtra Assembly elections, no final formula for seat sharing between BJP and Shiv Sena has been decided
 upar se arpiai, swabhimani shetakari sanghathan jaisi partiyaan bhi do ankon main siten chaahati hai
 In such a situation, through the editorial of Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana', Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray has looted allies
 'saamana' ke sampadakeey main uddhav ne likhaa he, "gathbandhan ko satta main laana sabhi ghatak dalon kaa sapana hona chahie, zyada siton kii lalak sabko chhodani hogi, itnaa mila to hi gathbandhan main rahenge, nahin to apana rasta, ye thik nahin he
 Remember, more greed leads to divorce
 " However, the BJP is soft on Shiv Sena's warm attitude
 bijepi netaa vinod taavade ne kaha, maine sampadakeey padhaa nahin he or na hi maine uddhav thakare kaa bayaan suna he, isliye main is par tippanee nahin kar saktaa
 There are 288 seats in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly
 pichley kai saalon se or 2009 main bhi shivasena 169 siton par ladi thi, use jeet mili thi 44 siton par, jabaki 119 siton par ladakar bijepi 46 siten jitkar laai thi
 In such a situation, after a great performance in the Lok Sabha, the BJP wants to match with the younger brother in Maharashtra
 udhar, arpiai athavle, swabhimani shetakari sanghathan jaise chote dalon ne bhi do ankon main seat kii demand rakhi he or maang nahin maanane par dhamkee gathbandhan todane di he
 Despite all this, BJP believes that the conversation is positive
 maharashtra vidhanparishad main netaa pratipaksh vinod taavade ne kaha, baatcheet sakaaratmak disha main chal rahi he
 We will take a final decision on seat sharing soon
 
 
 ham sabakaa makasad he ki pradesh ko congress-ensipi kii bhrasht sarkaar se mukti dilaaein
 According to sources, Shiv Sena has agreed to increase the BJP to about 135 seats from 119, but the screw is still stuck with constituents like RPI Athawale, Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan, Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, as they too have seats in 10

 ames netra vibhaag ke research wing ne ankhon ke retina main hone vaali kamajori kaa kaaran jaanane ke liye falon or subjiyon main maujuud paushtik tatwon kii jaanch shuru kii or uske jo parinaam aae, wo chaunkaane vaale the
 This study, which lasted for almost three years, revealed that fruits and vegetables found in South India have much higher nutritional content than fruits and vegetables found in delhi-ncr
 aap soch rahe honge ki retina main maujuud makula kafal-subjiyonki study se kya lenaa-dena
 We clear your confusion
 makula retina kaa wo bhaag he jahaan se bahut saaf dikhaai detaa he lekin 50-55 saal ke aasapaas ye kamjor padane lagati he
 The food that is required in these cells to be healthy is the carotenoids present in fruits and vegetables
 isi tarah falon or subjiyon main maujuud licopine jo mukhyat: tamaato main paaya jaataa he beta caroten jo gaajar me zyada miltaa he, bhi makula kii cells ko bhojan kii aapurti karaate he
 The research wing of AIIMS started work to investigate this
 teen saal tak chali stadeedow
 Alok Kumar Ravi said that initially samples of 51 vegetables and 20 fruits were collected from 10 and 12 places from Chennai and Tamil Nadu and adjoining areas of South India and from North India especially NCR
 inamen maujuud paushtik tatwon kii jaanch kaa kaam lagbhag teen saal chalaa
 The investigation found that vegetables other than carotenoids in delhi-ncr had less amount of natural elements other than carotenoids, while samples of fruits and vegetables found in South India were much higher
 ye bhi pataa chalaa ki alag-alag fal subjiyon main paushtik tatwon kii maujuudagi kaa antar bhi alag-alag tha
 In some, it was very high, such as the quantity of nutritious elements in black grapes sold in delhi-ncr 14
 70 thi or dakshin bharat main isaki maatra 24
 90 ml
 isi tarah amaruud main isaki maatra 38
 40 and the quantity of nutritious elements in guava sold in Delhi is only 6
 90 mili
 Dr
 alok ne bataaya ki subjiyon aurafalon kii gunvatttaparyaavaran, taapmaana, kheti ke tareeke, khaad aadi par nirbhar karte hai or is study se sidhe taur par sanket milte hai ki north india main ugane vaali subjiyon main kai kaarnon se paushtik tatv kam he
 However, the amount of carotenoids in people of South India was investigated by Cummus 15 retinas from North India and 13 from South India
 It was more in his macula
 dow
 Alok believes that it depends on food
 north ke log bahut zyada subjiyon kaa seven karte hai or dakshin bharat main ye kam he

 Even today, they are longing for development
 unako aage badhane nahin diya gaya
 He said, 'I raise his voice which is written in the Constitution
 main uski baat karata hum
 On his disputed statement that counted the security forces who were martyred, Owaisi said that if i talk about the number of martyrs, then what is the objection in that, if it is raised how many Muslim martyrs have been killed among the dead No one should mind because it shows the feeling of patriotism that even among Muslims, the feeling of patriotism is not less
 kashmiri panditon ko jammu-kashmir vaapasi ke sawaal par ovaisi ne kaha, 'main bhi chahta hum ki kashmiri panditon kii ghar vaapasi honi chahie

 vaise pichley kuch samay se public main saath na najar aane kii vajah se donon ke bich kii in duriyon ko pehle hi mahasoos kiya ja rahaa tha
 From the success party of Farhan's recent release 'wazir' to the calendar launch event of Dabboo Ratnani, where all the Bollywood stars were seen, Adhuna was nowhere to be seen with Farhan
 bataa den ki in donon kii mulaakaat 'dil chahta he' kii shooting ke dauraan hui thi

 The movement of the movement under the banner of Sarva Brahman Vikas Parishad has started to be disturbed
 brahman samudaay kaa yah sanghathan kaaphi purana he
 It has always been active among the people of the community, but this organization has taken a political form after seeing the attitude of the current NDA government in the SCST Act
 is sanghathan ke adhyaksh pandit camel kishor avasthi ne bataaya ki essiasti kanoon ke saamaanya varg virdohi swaroop ko agar jald nahin badla gaya to sarkaar ko brahman samaaj ke ekajute virodh kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 This protest will not be limited only to slogans or slogans, but the current government will have to bear its consequences in the Lok Sabha elections
 har ravivaar ko hone vaali baithak main shaamil hone vaale ek karmkandi yuva brahman ne bataaya ''aisa pehali baar ho rahaa he ki karmkandi brahman ekajute hokar ek nishchit sthaan par ek saath vichaar-vimarsh kar rahe hai
 Otherwise, ritualistic Brahmins do not attend any assembly conference
 ''ve kehete hai, essiasti act ko sakht karnaa sarkaar kii sabase badi galati he
 One is discrimination against Brahmins in the name of reservation, and secondly, under the Dalit Act, the Brahmins are being tortured by false cases
 pandit camel kishor kii maane to is sanghathan se upi bhar main paanch lakh log jude hue hai
 The anger of the Brahmin organization in UP can act like a spark to provoke anger within the general class, given the manner in which the mps backward minority organization ie SPX blew the bugle against the Shivraj government
 upi main kareeb saadhe aath pratishat vot brahmanon ke hai
 In such a situation, after MP, now the anger that is growing against BJP in UP can not only be over in the assembly elections but also in the Lok Sabha elections
 do oktober ko brahmanon ke ghar lagenge kaale jhandegandhi jayanti ke din do oktober ko har brahman ke ghar main kaale jhande lagaae jaaenge
 There will be a peaceful protest against the government

 If not, then a huge rally will be held in the third week of December

 Actually, the Central Government overturned the Supreme Court's decision and restored the SC / ST Act back to its original form
 haal hi main ye sanshodhit essi / asti (atrocity act) phir se lagu kiya he
 Now again under this Act, investigation without arrest became possible

 lashkar-e-taiyaba kaa aatankwaadi david colman hedli chahta he ki uskaa paanch saal kaa betaa bada hokar pakistani sena ke vishesh commando daste special sarvice group (esasji) main shaamil ho
 SSG is known for its role in Kargil incursions and other battles with India
 pakistani mul ke sandigdh aatankwaadi or apane dost tahawwur hossain rana ke khilaaf sunwaayee ke dauraan bataur gavaah adaalat main pesh hua hedli apane bete kii isi maansikta ke saath parvaris kar rahaa he ki ek din vah esasji kaa hissaa bane
 The result of Headley's predestination is that one day when his son's football coach asked him to kick (kick) the ball with his feet, he did not do it, but instead came in a gun position
 isse uske bheetar bhari ja rahi bhaavana kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Headley made this disclosure about his son during testimony in a Chicago court
 adaalat main hedli ne manjuur kiya tha ki mumbai hamale ke liye pakistani khufia agency iesai ne use madad muhaiyaa karai thi
 In court, the defense attorney asked Headley, your son plays football
 kya yah sahi he? hedli ne iskaa jawaab haa main diya or bataaya ki uskaa betaa paanch saal kaa he
 Citing an incident involving the football coach, the attorney asked, "have you taught your son this?" Headley said no
 usne mujhe pakistan main bandook chalaate hue dekha he
 Then the attorney asked, what do you want to make your son? He replied, i want him to join SSG
 main khud isamen bhartee hona chahta tha
 i have told him many times about this
 main apane bachche kii isi dhang se parvaris kar rahaa hum ki ek din vah is daste kaa hissaa bane
 Significantly, the ssg's role was also in the Kargil incursion, although here it had to face the hands of the security forces of India

 namaskara main raveesh kumaar, aakhirkaar bharat ke vikaas ke liye zaruri muddon par bahes hone lagi jaise iske liye jo sabase pehla kaam karnaa baaki rah gaya tha wo tha ki gandhi ke hatyare godse ko rashtrabhakt bataanaa
 BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj has done this important work on priority
 zaahir he sakshi maharaj ne pradhanmantri ke nae daftar ko nahin dekha hoga jahaan unki kursi ke peeche gandhi virajman hai
 In the name of Gandhi, Prime Minister Modi launched Swachhta Abhiyan, the biggest program of his political and government life
 sakshi maharaj kii is daleel ke hisaab se is desh ke saare sajayaftaa apradhi rashtrabhakt ho sakate hai or un sabko saansad hi bana dena chahie
 Senior Minister Vekaiah Naidu clearly stated that no one can associate himself with the person who is the killer of Mahatma Gandhi
 baad main jab hangaamaa hua to sakshi maharaj media se bol gaye ki godse rashtrabhakt nahin tha
 i said it by mistake

 On the issue of alleged conversion to Agra in the Lok Sabha, the opposition accused the BJP government of leaving the development agenda and following the agenda of the Sangh
 jawaab main venkaiya naidu ne is masale par vipaksh or sarkaar donon ko achche se sambhala
 Attacked, laughed, made new slogans, but escaped speaking out against the politics that the opposition wanted to surround his government
 vekainya is kadar apane bhaashan ke lay taal ke moh main ulajhate chale gaye ki jawaab dete-dete un sawaalon ko sahi tehraane lage jinka jawaab dene ke liye uthe the
 When you listen to his speech carefully, you will understand how Venkaiah is seen standing in his favor, attacking the opposition without openly condemning these issues of conversion
 ve zarur vikaas ke agenda kii baat karte rahe, lekin dharmik sankeernata se jude masalon or bayanon ko ulta vipaksh par bhi thope diya
 Started counting when and where the conversion took place, when the BJP was not there, they started saying that Smriti Irani was reluctant to go to astrology, then everyone should stand against it, Sanskrit was made mandatory during the UPA, India to reunite Pakistan
 Dinanath Batra, who talked about dreaming and teaching a map of unbroken India, started describing him as a great educationist
 aresas ko mahaan sanghathan bataaya or jamkar tarif kii
 From the point of view of the BJP and the Modi government, Venkaiah handled the front very well
 unke bhaashan main sab tha, ek bharat, sabhi dharmon kaa bharat lekin unke bhaashan main is vividhta vaale bharat ke khilaaf kaam karne vaale tatwon ke kilaaf kuch nahin tha
 They did not even leave Gandhi completely, save Gandhi from Sakshi Maharaj, who called Nathuram Godse a patriot
 sau saal puraane gandhi kaa kathan le aae jisamen gandhi ne dharmantaran ko mana tha or virodh kiya tha
 That statement does not necessarily reveal Gandhi's entire view of the freedom of religion and religious beliefs, but he has defied the opposition with the help of Gandhi
 kam se kam ve apane istemaal ke liye gandhi padhakar aae the or gandhi gandhi ratane vaala vipaksh gandhi kaa naam sunate hi chup ho gaya
 But what Rajeshwar Rao of the Sangh's Dharma Jagran Samiti in Agra said was exactly the opposite of what Venkaiah and Gandhi said
 ye unka tivi par bolaa hua bayaan he jo likhakar laayaa hum
 Rajeshwar Rao says that we too are complete Hindus
 ye bhi dekhenge ki koi musalmaan roak le, isai roak le, sarkaar roak le, abhi to thakur bane hai hamaare sang rahenge
 Come to Aligarh, on 25 December
 teen camp ham kar chuke hai
 To make Christians Hindu
 hamane salenagar main musalamaanon ko hindu banaaya he, agra main 20-25 hazaar ko hindu banaaya he
 We are not luring anyone
 ham to thakur bana rahe hai
 If someone in this country says that because of the BPL card, he has agreed to change his religion, then before disputing it, think about the terrible picture of poverty which is related to development
 agra main kathith rup se hue dharmantaran ko lekar hangaamaa he
 So many aspects have come out in this uproar that now we should wait for its investigation
 iske jabaran hone yaa apane man se hone ke pramaan hone yaa na hone ke baad bhi isaki raajnneeti ke apane khatre or myne hai

 The new changes coming to the show will be extremely exciting
 dekhne vaali baat ye hogi ki naira or karthik apane parivaar ke in bigade rishton ko kaise sambhalate hai
 Google has recently launched Tej, a digital payment app for India
 is ap ke saath company refral program kii bhi shuruyaat kii thi jiske tahat yujar ko har refral par 51 rupee milte hai
 Referral means if you refer someone and that user installs the app through your link, then money will come to your account for Rs 51
 google tej ap ke refral program main ek badi khami saamne ai he
 Using this, a hacker can easily hack your Gmail account
 google tej ke refral main bag paaya gaya jise yuj karke havers kisi yujar kaa jimail acount kaa seshan hack kar sakate hai
 Update - Using Google's fast app referral is now safe and secure
 google ne is bag ko thik kar liya he
 Indian hacker Yogesh Tuntak has informed Google about this bug found in the refeler of Tej App
 haalanki jaankaree milane ke baad google ne is bag ko thik kar liya he
 When we talked to Yogesh Tuntak, he told that Google has fixed it and now hackers cannot use it wrongly
 unhone hamen yah bhi bataaya he ki kis tarah aasaani se google ke refral ko kisi yujar kaa acount yuj karne ke liye havers ise istemaal kar sakate hai
 Actually, the use of bugs ie fast referral could have caused arbitrary code to be injected into it
 isse us customer ke jimail token churaae ja sakate the jise yah recoler code bheja gaya he
 By doing so, the attacker can take over the Gmail account
 google security team ne mana ki yah bag he or ise baad main thik kiya gaya
 Account hacking from referral programs was also more accurate because the referral link to which it was sent was not in doubt that it was an incorrect link
 kyonki usamen domen google kaa tha or google kaa domen dekhakar log link par aasaani se vishwaas kar lete hai
 In this sense, this bug was very dangerous
 kya he tej ap?technology diggaj google ne bharat main online pement sarvicelaunch kar diya he
 a special app is available for this, which is named Tej
 yah ap android or ios donon plateform ke liye banaaya gaya he or ise free downlod kiya ja saktaa he
 We told you earlier that Google can launch this app on Monday and now the company has officially launched it
 yani ab petm ko takkar dene ke liye google apane is ap ke saath taiyaar he
 Let's know how this app works and how much you will benefit from it
 apane mobile main aise karen Tez kaa seoup- android ap or ios par ise ap store / play store se downlod karnaa he
 - After downloading, you have to set Google PIN or screen lock
 - tisare step ke taur par aapako bank acount link karnaa hoga 
 For this, if your account is linked to mobile number, then the number has to be entered
 aapako mobile se ek massej kiya jayega or is number se jitne acount link kiye gaye honge wo khud aid kar liya jayega
 Now you can send money to anyone by going to the option
 Tez ap kii ye hai khaasiyattej ap se bank main paise transfar kar sakate hantej ap ke jariye apane bank acount se pement kar sakate hai
 That is, Google will not take any commission for this and the money will be safe in your bank and will not go to Google
 google ke mutabik iske liye customers koi khaas tareeke kaa acount bhi nahin khulwaanaa hoga

 yah puraa masalaa shanivaar ko dobaaraa surkhiyaan main aayaa, jab ek english akhbaar ne chapa ki bisisiai ne is maamle main dhoni ke kilaaf jaanch shuru kar di he
 In the news, quoting BCCI President Jagmohan Dalmiya, it was said, 'the matter related to the alleged conflict of interest related to Dhoni is with the Disciplinary Committee
 is bare main ham kuch bhi tabhi kah sakate hai jab jaanch ke baad samiti kii report aa jaae'
 By the end of the evening, the matter was also cleared from the BCCI side towards Dalmia
 adhyaksh kii ore se jari press release main kaha gaya ki daalamia ke bayaan ko todmode kar pesh kiya gaya he
 According to the chairman, he only said that if a player has shares in any sports company or business, then he will inform the board, which is the decision of the BCCI
 daalamia ne ye bhi kaha ki board ke is faisale ko amal main laane kii wo koshish karenge
 The comments gauratlab he ki dhoni team india ke central contract ke khilaadi hai
 Player management company Riti Sports apart from Dhoni also takes care of business interests of Suresh Raina and Ravinder Jadeja
 isi vajah se dhoni par hiton ke takaraav kaa aarope lagata rahaa he

 The whole issue came to headlines again on Saturday, when an English newspaper printed that the BCCI has started an investigation against Dhoni in this case
 khabar main bisisiai adhyaksh jagmohan daalamia ke hawaale se ye kaha gaya, 'dhoni se jude kathith hiton ke takaraav vaala maamla anushaasan samiti ke paas he
 We can say anything about this only when the report of the committee comes after the investigation '
 shaam hote-hote bisisiai kii taraf se is maamle par safaai bhi daalamia kii taraf se di gai
 The press release issued by the chairman said that Dalmiya's statement was subverted
 adhyaksh ke mutabik unhone sirf itnaa kaha tha ki kisi khilaadi kaa agar kisi bhi sports company yaa bijnes main share he to wo isaki jaankaree board ko degaa, jo bisisiai kaa faisalaa he
 Dalmiya also said that he will try to implement this decision of the board
 tippaniyan Significantly, Dhoni is a player of Team India's Central Contract
 vahiin player menerement company reeti sports dhoni ke alaava suresh raina or ravinder jadeja ke vyavsaayik hiton kaa bhi dhyaan rakhti he

 unhone kaha, ''agar vikaas kii raftaar yun hi bani rahati he, to ham lakhon logon ko garibi se baahar nikaalane main kaamyaab ho sakate hai

 In our country, farming is generally considered to be a profession where even after hard work, life is endured in poverty
 lekin kuch logon ne kele kii kheti se khaasaa dhan kamakar is myth ko todaa he
 Originally a plant in coastal areas, Banana is bringing prosperity and prestige to many farmers in the Terai districts of Uttar Pradesh, Bahraich, Shravasti, Barabanki, Balrampur, Lakhimpur etc
 in jilon ke kai kisaanon ne tishyu culture kele kii kheti ko apanaakar ek nae krishi vyavsaayeekaran kii parampara kii shuruyaat kii he
 Ram Saran Varma of Daulatpur village of Barabanki has emerged as a hero in the state with the help of banana cultivation
 unhone apane khet kaa naam ‘haai tech krishi farm’ rakhaa he
 Varma says, "some used to work in others' fields earlier
 1990 main 2 acre khet main 1,200 desi kele ke paudhon ke saath maine is kheti main kadam rakhaa tha or aaj ham 90 acre jameen par kele kii kheti karte hai
 "they say that banana cultivation costs up to one lakh rupees per acre and net profit of up to two and a half lakh rupees
 verma kaa yah farm or unki kheti kii takanic kitni prasiddh he, is baat kaa andaja is baat se bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he ki pradesh ke rajyapal bi
 L
 joshi ne verma kii krishi takanic ko dekhne ke liye unke farm kaa nirikshan kiya tha
 Tissue culture is a scientific method in which a banana plant is prepared in a bio lab and then planted in the field
 tishyu culture se taiyaar kele ke paudhe virus or anya rogon se mukt hote hai
 The banana harvest time is 15 months, in which new plants are planted every year in the month of July and fruit flakes are ready around October next year
 vahiin, 1972 main lakhanu vivi se biochemestry main emessi karne vaale baharich ke krishi vyavsaayee jai singh ne krishi ko vyavsaay main badal diya he
 He says, "I started banana cultivation in 1981 with a native banana plant
 tishyu culture kii shuruyaat 1995 main hui
 “jai Singh cultivates banana on almost 50 acres of land and Rs 2
5 lakh per acre
 tak kaa shudgh munafa kama rahe hai
 The trend towards this farming is also increasing among the unemployed
 barabanki ke hi anil kumaar verma ne lakhanu vivi se snaatak karne ke baad apane parivaar kii do acre jameen par karj lekar kele kii kheti kii shuruyaat kii or ab tak apni do acre jameen ko saat acre main failaa chuke hai
 At the same time, like Anil, Azim Mirza, a farmer from Bahraich, changed his fortunes with banana cultivation
 kele kii kheti se mili laabh ke bare main bataate hue mirza kehete hai, “sirf kele kii kheti se aaj maine paanch acre jameen or lakhanu main kareeb 11 lakh ru
 Has bought a plot of ”kele kii kheti ab kai logon ke liye rojgaar kaa hissaa ban chuki he

 BJP leader Vinay Katiyar's statement on Priyanka Gandhi has been strongly criticized by the Congress
 upi main party kii prachaar samiti ke adhyaksh dow
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Sanjay Singh described the statement as unfortunate
 'netaaon ko impress karne kii koshish'sanjay singh kaa kahana tha ki is bayaan kii kade shabdon main ninda honi chahie
 He alleged that his party had put Katiyar in 'cold storage'
 lihaaja wo apane netaaon ko impress karne ke liye is tarah ke bayaan de rahe hai
 He demanded the Election Commission to take cognizance of this statement
 sanjay singh kaa daawa tha ki bijepi upi ke chunavi maidan main aapa kho baithi he or party kii haar tay he
 According to him, half the population of UP is women and they will definitely teach the BJP a lesson in elections

 While the statement is embarrassing, Congress MP from Assam Sushmita Dev termed Katiyar's statement as shameful
 unhone katiyaar ko yaad dilaayaa ki pradhanmantri modi ne aam chunaav ke vakt 'bahut hua mahilaon par atyaachaar, abaki baar modi sarkaar kaa naaraa diya tha
 Sushmita asked Katiyar whether this slogan was a lie? He exhorted Katiyar not to follow his footsteps and women can do better politics than him
 sushmita dev kaa kahana tha ki katiyaar jaise netaaon kii soch ke chalate hi mahilaayein raajnneeti main aane se parhez karti hai

 katiyaar yaheen nahin ruke
 He said that as much as Priyanka is said to be beautiful, she is not as beautiful

 Exactly a year ago, on the night of June 16 and in the morning of June 17, the flood above Kedarnath destroyed a large part of Uttarakhand
 himalay main aisi tabaahi kabhi kisi ne dekhi nahin thi
 The mountains collapsed and collapsed, the rivers carried large buildings with their speed, turning them into rubble
 saikadon vargamil kaa ilaaka jaise shmashaan main badal gaya
 Amidst this devastation, NDTV India reporter Hridayesh Joshi was the first person to take stock of these areas and reach Kedar valley and Kedarnath
 cheekhti hui sansanikhej reporting ke is daur main hridayesh joshi ne bade samvedansheel dhang se is traasadee ke vibhinn pahaluon ko pakadaa, pesh kiya or yah samajhane kii koshish kii ki aakhir himalay jaisi viraat yah traasadee kyon ghatit hui
 Even after that period of reporting passed, the questions of Kedarnath continued to haunt Hridesh Joshi
 kedarnath traasadee ke redimaid javaabon se vah santusht nahin the
 Eventually he expanded his research further and eventually wrote an entire book on it - 'why are you silent Kedar' is kitaab se guzarate hue saal bhar pehle ghati us puri traasadee kii tasviir nae sire se ubhar aati he
 Hridayesh Joshi diligently explains how the state system completely failed in the initial days in the face of that tragedy and how its own collectivity of common villagers helped the trapped people
 vah yah dekh pate hai ki jis vakt bhartiya sena ke payalat apni jaan jokhim main daalkar or ek ke baad ek udaanen bharte hue logon kii jaan bachaane main lage hue the, us vakt sena ke ek general teen helicopter lekar aae, lekin unhone kisi ko apane saath surakshit jagah pahunchane kii jahamat mol nahin lee
 But the value of the book is much more in these periodical details, more than that in investigating why this tragedy happened
 haadase ke pehle hi din se is sawaal ke kai jane-pahachaane jawaab de die gaye - ise ishwar kaa prakope bataane se lekar prakruti ke saath kiye gaye khilwaad kaa nateeja tak kaha gaya
 Actually, people were choosing their own logic between their faith and their own conscience, but Hridayesh understands that this part of the Himalayas is not a geographical location for the locals here, a spiritual presence There is also - people get both strength and faith from it amidst all the crises and difficulties
 yahi vajah he ki vah kitaab kaa sheershak chunate hue kedarnath kii isi aadhyatmik upasthiti ko sambodhit kar rahe hote hai
 But this spiritual experience does not make Hridesh Joshi the fetters of his feet
 vah badi baariki se is baat kaa muyna karte hai ki traasadee kii taatkaalik or doorgaami vajahen kya-kya raheen or kaise ek prakritik parighatna ek maanviya traasadee main parivartit ho gai
 The Himalayan region has a history of natural sabotage and transformation
 isaki god main palane vaali samskritiyaan isaki is samvedansheel bhugolic prakruti kaa sammaan karti raheen or in badlaavon ke liye paryaapt jagah bachaae rakhti raheen
 But as the pilgrimage changed to tourism in the second half of the 20th century, as the business use of religion increased, as the journey of Kedarnath was handed over to the hotel industry, the brittleness of the Himalayas also increased and that place Also, where the mountain would have spread its legs, the river could have opened its shoulders
 jab traasadee hui, tab lagaataar ho rahi barish ke bich mausam vibhaag kii chetavanee kii har kisi ne upeksha kii
 Neither the tourists took it seriously nor the government
 shaayad khud mausam vibhaag bhi is abhyaas kaa maaraa rahaa ki usne chetavanee dekar apana daayitv puraa kar liya he - ab ise koi sune yaa na sune
 Overall, this tragedy reminds me of how we Indian people have become accustomed to the lifestyle of criminal negligence towards life
 jo traasadee saaf taur par nazar aa gai, vah us traasadee ke mukaable choti he, jo chupchaap barason se himalay kii vaadiyon main ghatit ho rahi he
 The book of Hridayesh Joshi does not just give voice to Kedarnath, it appeals to us the most to understand this tragedy and change ourselves
 kareeb 200 prishthon kii is kitaab kaa 14 june ko locarpan ho rahaa he
 'why did you keep quiet Kedar' lekhak : hridayesh joshi Article publication, Rs 395 bazaar niamak sebi ne pichley kuch varshon main aae companiyon ke pratham saarvajanik share nirgamon (ipo) main farji aavedan kii sambhaavnaaon kii jaanch shuru kii he
 The regulator has decided to investigate other issues after the Vaswani industry case came to light
 vaasavani ke ipo main aaven kaa str badhaane ke liye farji aavedan bhavaaye jane kaa andeh he
 SEBI had suspended the listing of Vaswani Industries earlier this month on suspicion of irregularity in IPO applications and ordered an inquiry into the matter last week
 jaanch agle chah maheene main puri hogi
 According to sources, SEBI has received complaints about the IPO in the last two-three years stating that the promoters sided with some operators to show more subscriptions to the issue through fake bids
 baad main unhone ise waapas le liya yaa share soochibaddh hone ke pehle din hi tut gaya
 Concerned over the alleged irregularity, SEBI has decided to conduct a detailed investigation into IPO related matters and will soon seek data and information related to stock exchanges, merchant bankers and other entities
 sutron ne kaha ki jaanch main vaise ipo par vishesh taur par gaur kiya jayega jahaan boli peshkash khuli rahane ke dauraan waapas le lee gai ho yaa phir soochibaddhta ke pehle din share main baari giravat darj kii gai

 captain viraat kohli or anil kumble ke bich hue vivaad ne bhartiya cricket main bhuuchaal-sa laa diya he
 Since the controversy, everyone's attention has shifted to this except cricket
 har koi is vivaad par dhyaan or bayaan de rahaa he, vahiin nae coach kii charchaa bhi joro par he
 The BCCI has found a new coach, meanwhile former veteran Sunil Gavaskar has said that the BCCI should ask Virat Kohli who will become the coach
 lekin is sabhi ke bich ek cheharaa aisa he jo lagaataar maun he
 That is Team India's batting coach Sanjay Bangar
 sanjay bangad pichley lambey samay se team ke saath jude hai, or lagaataar acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Why did Kumble get upset? Kohli took the bowling in the final with the team in 2014, not accepting the decision of the meeting, and if he spoke with Team India, he was associated with the team in August 2014 as a batting coach
 2016 main jab team zimbabwe daure par thi, to mukhya coach the
 But after Anil Kumble was appointed as the coach, he was again appointed as batting coach
 kohli bhi hai khushkptain viraat kohli ne bhi lagaataar sanjay bangad kii tarif kii thi
 After the semi-final against Bangladesh, Kohli said in the press conference that the batting has become stronger because of Bangar
 PAK se haar or kumble ke istife se dukhi ek fain kaa khulaa khat- viraat bhai, aap to aise na thedamdaar recordgar sanjay bangad ke record kii baat karen to koching main unka pradarshan acha rahaa he
 Bangar was also a coach for india-a, and was also a coach for the Kochi Tuskers in 2010
 vahiin 2014 main IPL sijan main vah punjab team ke saath jude or unki koching main team ne acha pradarshan kiya
 Punjab also reached the finals
 kumble-shastri se achche the sambandhsanjay bangad ke sambandh anil kumble or ravi shastri donon ke kaarykaal ke dauraan achche rahe hai
 Bangar was also appointed as the batting coach when Ravi Shastri was the director of the team and the team was consistently doing well
 kyon naa bangad hi bane coach?bisisiai ab nae coach kii talash main he
 But Bangar's name is nowhere in this discussion
 sanjay bangad team ke saath kaaphi lambey samay se jude hai, captain or team ke saath unke achche sambandh bhi he
 Also, his record is also good
 coach pad ke liye vah ek acchhee pasand ho sakate hai
 This is not Kumble's defeat of BCCI, sachin-sourav-laxman was also not respected! kuch karmchaariyon ne infosis ke varisht adhikariyon kii shikaayat kii haiske baad infosis mushkil main he, share tut gaye hameb crisil ne reating ko nigaraanee shrenee main rakh diya haivisal blor dwaara infosis ke varisht adhikariyon kii shikaayat ke baad company kii mushkil kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahi
 Now rating agency CRISIL has placed its rating in the 'monitoring' category
 gauratlab he ki crisil ne infosis ko tripal e (AAA) reating di he, jo ab tak kisi company ko di gai sarvocch reating he
 Rating agency Crisil said in a statement, 'crisil has kept in mind what steps are being taken by Infosys board and audit committee regarding the whistle blower (whip) complaint
 crisil aage bhi halaat kii nigaraanee karegi
 The company said that once 'sufficient clarity about the investigation is received and the Infosys management receives sufficient updates, this rating (monitored) will be lifted
 kuch bhi mahatvapurn paaya jaataa he, or regulator yaa sarkari agenciyon ke dwaara koi mahatvapurn nishkarsh saamne aata he, to reating ke hisaab se is par nigaraanee rakhi jaaegi
 Significantly, on the day it was revealed that some employees of Infosys wrote letters to the stock exchanges and complained to the CEO and CFO of the company, on the same day Infosys shares fell by 17% and its shareholders in a day 55,000 crore rupees were lost
 times of india kii ek khabar ke anusaar, kam se kam do brokerej ne apane graahakon ko chetavanee di he ki yadi aarope sach sabit hote hai to company ke siio salil paarekh or siefo nilanjan roy ko company chhodani hogi
 What is the case of Infosys? Actually, IT company Infosys CEO Salil Parekh and CFO Nilanjan Roy Parki have been accused of wrongdoing
 haal hi main visal blor ke ek samooh ne in donon par kam samay main aay or laabh badhaane ke liye ‘aniatik vyavhaaron’ main lipt hone kii shikaayat kii he
 The group claims that email and voice recordings also exist to substantiate the allegations
 is bich, company kii ore se kaha gaya he ki ham maamle kii jaanch kar rahe hai
 What is the complaint The allegation is that Infosys CEO Salil Parekh ignored the review report of big deals and hid the information from the auditor and company board
 letters main kaha gaya he ki 'salil paarekh ne unase kaha ki margin dikhaane ke liye galat anumaan pesh karen or unhone hamen bade saudon ke masale par board main prajentation pesh karne se roka
 Infosys CFO Neelanjan Roy has also been accused of making changes in 'investment policy and accounting' without taking necessary approvals from the board and auditors to see higher Infosys profits in the short term

 All the allies are united in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the bjp-led NDA face in the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 jabaki vipaksh kii ore piem pad kaa daavedaar koun hoga, is par abhi ek raay nahin ban paa rahi he
 Congress where Rahul Gandhi's name is being put forward
 vahiin,basapapramukhmayawatiapani majboot daavedaari ke liye rajyon main pair pasaar rahi hai
 For this, Mayawati has adopted a strategy to join hands with regional parties instead of Congress
 upi main pichley teen chunaavon main mayawati buree tarah haari hai
 There is not a single BSP MP in the Lok Sabha, in which 11 years ago, Mayawati formed the government with an absolute majority, today she has only 19 mlas
 baavjood iske vepradhanmantri padaper majabooj daawa thonk rahi hai
 BSP spokesman Sudhindra Bhadoria told India Today that Mayawati is better than Congress President Rahul Gandhi as a candidate for the post of Prime Minister
 iske alaava chaar baar uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri rahi hai
 Mayawati has long experience as party president and chief minister
 yahi vajah he ki vipakshi dalon ke netaa bhi unhen piem ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Explain that after BJP and Congress, BSP is the third party in the country, whose base is at the national level
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi or congress ke baad basapa ko sabase zyada vot mili the
 BSP 4 with 29 million votes
 1 fisadi mat hasil kiya tha
 However, with this vote scattered in many states of the country, the party could not win a single seat in the Lok Sabha
 uttar pradesh ke gorakhpur-phulpur loksabhaa seat par hue upachunaav main basapa ke samarthan se sapa ne jeet hasil kii to mayawati kogathabandhanaki takat kaa ehsaas hua
 Only after this, the BSP decided to contest elections with regional parties in different states
 gathbandhan formule kaa mayawati ne pehla prayog karnataka main kiya
 He contested the elections with regional party JDS instead of Congress and managed to win one seat
 isi ranneeti ke tahat basapa ne haryana main inelo ke saath gathbandhan kiya he
 At the same time, Chhattisgarh is in the electoral fray in collaboration with Ajit Jogi's party
 madhya pradesh or rajasthan main congress ke saath milane ke bajaay akele chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 Mayawati also seems to get a political advantage from this
 kshetreey dalon se gathbandhan ke thos shakl lene ke saath dalit sanghathanon or kshatrapon kii ore se mayawati ko pradhanmantri banane kii maang tej hoti jaaegi
 The leaders of the regional parties with whom the BSP has joined hands are projecting Mayawati as PM
 ajit jogi ne shanivaar ko bilaspur kii raily main mayawati ko 2019 main piem banane kii baat kahi
 He said that in other states like Chhattisgarh, he will contest elections with regional parties and make Mayawati the PM
 idhar haryana main parole par do saptaah ke liye jail se baahar aae inelo adhyaksh om prakaash chautaala ne ravivaar ko kaha ki basapa supremeo mayawati ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad aglaa pradhanmantri banane ke liye unki party vipakshi dalon ko ekasaath laane kii disha main kaam kar rahi he
 Politics is a game of possibilities
 aise main kshetreey dalon ke gathbandhan ko agle loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke khilaaf kamyaabi milti he to mayawati apni nai chhavi ke boote pradhanmantri pad ke liye daawa karne se peeche nahin hatengi
 It should be kept in mind that most regional parties have been doing politics of non-congressism
 darasal basapa adhyaksh is baat ko bakhubi samajhati hai ki 2019 main vipaksh kii ore se kisi bhi dal ko itani zyada siten nahin milane ja rahi he, jiske dam par ve sarkaar bana len
 In such a situation, the opposition can come together to prevent Narendra Modi from coming to power

 Significantly, many stars like Anurag Kashyap, Anupam Kher, Shruti Seth, Vikrant Massey, Shekhar Kapur have expressed their views on this issue

 The resignation of 67-year-old MLA Ram Singh Sodha from the Sindh province assembly last year in Pakistan and his family's exodus from Kutch created a stir in both Pakistan and India
 unke is faisle ko pakistan main kattar musalamaanon ke haathon hinduon par badhate julm ke sanket ke taur par dekha gaya
 Sodha, a lawyer, spoke to India Today Senior Editor Uday Mahurkar at Kachchana in Kutch
 lekin ve bahut sanbhalkar bole kyonki unke bahut se rishtedaar ab bhi pakistan main rahete hai
 Excerpts: How do you see the situation in Pakistan? There are still a large number of moderate Muslims in Pakistan who want to live in harmony with Hindus
 lekin ve bamon or wahabi ugravadiyon kii banduukon se bhaybheet rahete hai
 These Wahabis are also ready to give their lives to kill their religious opponents
 halaat or bhi gambhir hote ja rahe hai
 However, the situation is slightly better in lower Sindh, where local Sindhi Muslims believe in Sufism and they protect and care for Hindus
 pakistan se bhaagane kii taatkaalik vajah kya thi?wahabiwad punjab se chalata hua upree sindh main kareeb-kareeb pahunch chukaa he
 If no miracle happens, it will reach the lower Sindh in no time
 maine palaayan kaa faisla aatmaraksha ke doorgaami kadam ke taur par uthaaya
 Apart from this, weddings of us Sodha people of lower Sindh have been happening in Jadeja dynasty of Kutch
 is tarah yahaan se hamaare aitihaasik sambandh rahe hai
 Otherwise there was no immediate reason to leave Pakistan
 kya aapako badale kii karrwai kaa dar he
 Is that why you are hiding the real thing? Not at all
 main sirf sach boluungaa
 You cannot deny that militant Muslims are targeting liberal Muslims with more violence than before
 jinna ke pakistan or aaj ke pakistan main kya fark he
 Jinnah's religious minorities were safe in Pakistan, whereas even in today's Pakistan, liberal Muslims, who want to live together with other religious people, are not safe
 jinna ke vaadon ko unki maut ke baad turant bhula diya gaya
 But the real change came in the 70s when General
 jiya-ul-haq ne afghanistan kii ladaai kaa sahaara lekar kattarpanthi musalamaanon ko badhaava diya
 They made Hindus a separate voter and thus became second class citizens
 aapako pakistan main kya baat sabase zyada dang karti he?yah vidambnaa ki jis dharti ne seemaant gandhi khan abdul gaffaar khan ko janm diya vahi ab khoonkhaar islamic aatankwaadiyon ko paidaa kar rahi he
 When did you feel insecure for the first time? In 1986–87, some temples in Sindh were demolished in response to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement in India
 iskaa hal kya he?bharat or pakistan, donon ko ugravadiyon ke khilaaf muhim shuru kerani chahie
 And i firmly believe that the common people of both the countries want peace in return for the violence of the militants
 pakistan main hinduon kaa bhavishya kya hoga?dharmik sthiti or kharaab hone ke alaava hinduon kaa bhavishya bharat sarkaar par bhi nirbhar karata he
 The government will have to be more lenient in its behavior
 pakistan se aane vaale hinduon ko yahaan saat saal rahane ke baad naagarikta di jaati he or is dauraan vah yahaan na to koi kaam kar saktaa he, na hi kaarobaar
 This minimum term should be made three years
 jahaan tak pakistan main rahane kaa faisla karne vaale hinduon kaa sawaal he to unka bhavishya andhakaarmay he

 However, all the parties, except the Left parties, had decided to separate themselves from this bandh and celebrate it as Anger Day
 vaise sansad main ekta dikhaa rahe vipakshi dalon kii ekta sadakon par puri tarah se bikhri najar ai
 Significantly, all the opposition parties in Jharkhand are protesting against the CNT-SPT Act amendment bill passed by the state government as well as fierce protests
 aise main baar-baar honevaali bandi se honevaali aam-janata ke takalifon ke maddenjar vipakshi dalon ne band ko aakrosh diwas ke taur par manaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 The government, which was vigilant about the bandh, was involved in the protest, during the shutdown against the ban on government bandh, the opposition today staged a vigorous demonstration in Ranchi, which included a large number of women and youths
 unka kahana tha ki note bandi se aam logon kaa jivan prabhavit ho rahaa he, isse unke samaksh bhukhmaree kii samasya ho gai he
 This decision needs to be reconsidered by the central government
 note bandi main bharat band ko lekar jila prashasan ne ehtiyathan sabhi samvedansheel jagahon par dandadhikari or surakshabaalo kii niyukti kii thi
 There is also the issue of CNT-SPT Act, there is no getting rid of the bandh in hot Jharkhand, even though India has been untouched by the bandh to call for demonetisation, but in the coming days, the people of Jharkhand should be called by opposition parties on many other issues besides demonetisation

 Announcement of CBSE board results is a good step in the direction of population control # cbseresults2017 gauratlab he ki bas kuch hi der main 10veen ke nattejey ghoshit hone vaale hai
 The exam started from 9 March and lasted till 10 April
 moderation policy or dilli ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ke baad 12veen ke pariksha parinaam main bhi deree hui thi or board ne 28 may ko nattejey jari kiye the
 This time 1 in 12th result

 In the central government's annual budget, income tax is directly related to the common man for the common man
 vahiin, jab antarim bajet hi inakam tex niyamon main itani badi raahat kaa elaan kar de jisaki kalpana tak nahin kii ja sakati to aam aadmi kaa utsaah sheersh par pahunchnaa swaabhaavik he
 And it is also natural for the rising enthusiasm to become intermittent as the Sensex falls inverted
 kendra kii modi sarkaar ne paramparaon ko peeche chhodte hue sansad main apana antarim bajet pesh kiya or inakam tex niyamon main bade badlaav kaa elaan kiya
 Finance Minister Piyush Goyal exempted people with annual income up to Rs 5 lakh from income tax
 is elaan ko bajet spich main goyal ne 5 lakh rupee kii texable inakam ko tex free padhaa
 It is also written in speech
 sansad main hue is elaan ke baad soshal media samet media ne apana elaan kar diya ki middle class ko badi raahat or 5 lakh rupee tak vaarshik inakam ke tex slab ko tex free kar diya gaya he
 As the common man understood or was shown on television and website, it was a great relief for the job profession and small-medium business
 kyonki jaisaa kaha or likhaa gaya vah 10 lakh, 15 lakh or 20 lakh rupee tak kii vaarshik aay ke karadaataaon ke liye badi raahat sabit hoti
 There is no tax on his total income of Rs 5 lakh
 bhar rahe hai inakam tex ritern to yun DECODE karen apni SALARY slipjese hi vitt mantri ne 5 lakh tak aay waalon ko tex ribet main raahat kaa elaan kiya sansad main pradhanmantri samet zyaadaatar sadsy khushi se mej thapthapaane lage
 The finance minister himself was forced to stop his speech for two minutes and most of the members started shouting Modi, Modi's slogan
 swaabhaavik he ki shabdon kii baariki samajhane se chukne or is jashn se logon ne andaja laga liya ki chunaavon ke chalate kendra sarkaar ne tex dhaanche main bada parivartan karte hue tex bracket ko 2
 Increased from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 5 lakh
 iske alaava vitt mantri ne is elaan ke saath kaha ki is praavdhaan se teen tex backet main karodon logon ko phayda milegaa or iske chalate sarkari khajaane par 18,500 karod rupee kaa bhaar aayega
 This happiness is reflected in the fact that during the financial year 2014-15, the central government increased the income tax exemption limit from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 2
 50 lakh rupee karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 Apart from this, Section 80C of the Income Tax Act increased the savings limit from Rs 1 lakh to 1
 50 lakh rupee or homelon ke byaaj par raahat kii seemaa ko 1
 Announced to increase from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 2 lakh
 is elaan kaa phayda sabhi taxpere ko mila or swaabhaavik he ki is bachat ne aam aadmi kaa utsaah badhaayaa tha
 At the same time, when the Finance Minister Piyush Goyal declared taxable income of 5 lakh tax free in the interim budget, the confusion was natural
 isse pehle log antarim bajet main shabdon kaa khel ko samajhate, kanfusion soshal or news media par vyapak ho gaya
 Piyush Goyal, who reached the press conference directly after presenting the budget, first worked to remove the confusion of the people
 haalanki isse pehle ajtak channel par sateek khabar di ja chuki thi
 India Today editor Anshuman Tiwari warned social media through his tweet
 twit main likhaa ki vitt mantri ne ekjampashan (exemptions) kii jagah ribet (rebate) shabd kaa istemaal kiya he
 Tiwari said that the Finance Minister has increased the Basic Exposure Limit so people need to look at the copy of the Finance Bill before expressing their enthusiasm because only the exact description of the provision stated in the Budget Speech is found in the Bill
 finance bill dekhne ke baad jaahir hua ki bajet spich main ribet kii jagah iskar seemaa main ekjampashan ke liye inakam tex act ke section 87A main taxpere ko di ja rahi 2,500 rupee ke tex ribet kii seemaa ko badhaakar 12,500 rupee karne ke sanshodhan kaa prastaav dene kii baat he
 At the same time, it was written in the next line that tax rebate will now be available to taxpayers with a total income of up to Rs 5 lakh
 pehle yah seemaa 3
 Taxpayers with a total income of Rs 5 lakh used to get it
