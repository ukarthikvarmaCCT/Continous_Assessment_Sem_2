 ' The medical system in the state has collapsed due to the doctors going on strike in hospitals in Rajasthan
 kai dinon se samuhik istife kii dhamkee de rahe rajya ke sevarat doctor ravivaar kii raat se hi samuhik hadtaal par chale gaye hai
 On the other hand, the government has imposed strict action by declaring the strike of doctors as illegal by applying RESMA (rajasthan Essential Services Protection Act)
 darasal ravivaar ko raat dhai baje tak chikitsa mantri kaalicharan sarraf or doctoron ke sanghathanon se vaarta chali lekin baat nahin bani
 After that, doctors from district hospitals, CHC, medical colleges across the state went on strike, due to which patients had to face a lot of trouble today
 haalanki rajya sarkaar ne isse nipatane ke liye railway, army aspataal or biguef ke doctoron kii tainaati aspataalon main kii he

 After declaring Narendra Modi untouchable for many years, now America is going to change its policies rapidly
 pehle to usne apni rajdoot nancy powell ko unase milane bheja, lekin ab vah unki chuttee hi karne ja rahaa he
 According to a report in the English newspaper Hindustan Times, America is going to reinstate a new ambassador in India so that it can work with the new government
 vartmaan rajdoot nancy powell kii jagah ek raajnneetijna ko yah mahatvapurn pad diya ja saktaa he taaki bharat se rishte nae sire se banaae ja saken
 According to the newspaper, india-us can remove Powell to repair relations
 donon hi deshon ke bich ke rishte bighad gaye hai
 The United States wants to fix it, but no date has yet been set for Powell's removal
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke baad yani 16 may ke baad america is bare main kadam uthayega
 The biggest thing is that America is feeling that Modi's government will be formed here and the ban on their coming to America will lead to a breach in mutual relations between the two countries
 bijepi ke ek bade netaa ne akhbaar ko bataaya ki powell ko hataaya janaa lagbhag tay he kyonki vah piem candidet narendra modi ke prati bahut thanda rukh rakhti hai
 It is believed that Powell did not allow the US to lift the visa ban on Modi, while other Western countries took this step
 unke bare main mana jaataa he ki vah gujarat ke siem se milane main anakani kar rahi thim
 Modi feels Powell is very close to upa's foreign policy
 ve gandhinagar janaa nahin chaahati thim
 In response to this allegation, American sources say Powell was under pressure from the UPA government not to meet Modi
 ab powell ko hataa dene se modi kheme ko shant kiya ja saktaa he
 a diplomat said that the sacrifice of a diplomat for political purposes is part of his career
 devayani khobragade ke kapade utarkar talaashi lene ke maamle se bhi donon deshon ke rishton main daraar ai he
 In this case too, if Powell had shown his agility, the issue could have been resolved but he did nothing

 The burden of this expenditure will have to be borne by both the Central Government and the State Governments

 The burden of 72 dollars (11 thousand crore rupees) will have to be put on the government exchequer
 niti ayog ne is yojana par kaha he ki kendra sarkaar ke khate se lagbhag 5500-6000 karod rupee is yojana par kharch kiye jaaenge
 Read this: India will be the sixth largest economy in the world, now for three decades, the leadership has made a provision of Rs 2000 crores from the central treasury for this scheme in the Union Budget
 is rakam kaa praavdhaan vitt varsh 2018-19 ke dauraan logon ko swasth beemaa dene ke liye kiya gaya he
 At the same time, sources in the central government claim that the central government will make provision for this scheme in the future
 haalanki desh main kai rajya sarkarein kisi na kisi tarah ke swasthya beemaa kaa praavdhaan pehle se kar rahi hai
 Some states say that the plans of the state government will be affected due to the central government scheme
 niti ayog ke mutabik is yojana ke liye 60 fisadi kharch kendra or bachaa hua 40 fisadi rajya sarkaar vahan karengi
 According to the estimate of the Central Government, the cost of giving this insurance to a person in the country will come to about Rs 1100

 The central government has to face general elections in 2019

 However, in America, the Donald Trump government after Barack Obama closed the plan
 nae prashasan kaa daawa he ki is yojana kaa phayda kam he or kharch zyada he
 However, it is so clear that if obamacare of Obama administration was just a formula to win elections, then he succeeded in this strategy
 ab laal kile se ghoshnaa ke baad duniya kii sabase badi health insurance skim ko lagu kiya jayega
 The Central Government and the State Government have drawn up roadmaps to implement this scheme

 Therefore, in the next few days, the central government will disclose the specifics of the scheme as well as the insurance plan, the companies involved, the hospital network and health insurance premiums across the country

 In a special conversation with 'aaj Tak / India Today', Deodhar said that the bjp's victory in Tripura is not an overnight miracle but a result of the tireless work done by the party for the past three and a half years
 devdhar ne bataaya ki kis tarah beete do saal main kol centres banaae gaye, puure rajya main booth leader or modi doot banaae gaye
 Deodhar said that his agenda is clear about making the government the agenda of forming the government
 nitin gadakari or juaal oram tripura aaenge or party ke navnirvaachit vidhayakon se milenge
 They will convey their opinion to the party high command
 8 yaa 10 march ko shapath grahan samaaroh ho saktaa he
 But it will depend on meeting the Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri pehle hi kah chuke hai ki shapath grahan samaaroh main upasthit rahenge
 According to Deodhar, chief ministers of all bjp-ruled states across the country are also expected to be present at the swearing-in ceremony
 tripura kaa nayaa mukhyamantri koun hoga, is par devdhar ne kaha ki IPFT ne apni raay jataai he lekin antim faisla vidhayakon kii ore se liya jayega ki koun vidhayak dal kaa netaa hoga
 When Biplav Dev's name was ahead in the race for Chief Minister, Deodhar said that the party's parliamentary board would decide the name
 hinsa kaa antadevadhar ne kaha ki bijepi, sipiai(em) samet sabhi partiyon ke kaaryakartaaon se unki apil he ki rajya main kahin bhi hinsak takaraav kii sthiti naa aane den
 BJP is strongly against political crimes as the state has witnessed a lot of violence in the last 25 years
 ab aisi ghatnaon ke liye jagah nahin he
 We have promised the people of Tripura to stop violent incidents in the state
 sadakon ke naam badalane pardevadhar ne kaha ki tripura main kuch sadakon kaa naam nishchit rup se badla jayega
 For example, the Marx Engels table will be renamed
 abhi nayaa naam tay nahin lekin nishchit rup se ye badla jayega
 Even during the election campaign every ruby used to say to the government that your mentor Nripen Chakraborty was the real Marxist CM and his contribution was important but he was forgotten
 isliye ham kuch sadakon kaa naam avashya badalenge
 Lenin and Stalin are no longer needed in the state
 jaldi hi naam badale jaaenge
 According to Pranadevadhar not to eat fish for a year, he likes Bengali fish very much and it is eaten a lot in Tripura
 beete saal sawan ke maheene main dharmik kaarnon se maine ise khaanaa choda tha
 Apart from quitting fish during the monsoon, i vowed that i would eat fish again only after the Left's defeat in the state
 us vakt virodhiyon ne uphaas kiya tha ki is saal aisa nahin hoga or phir mujhe 5-6 saal tak machhlee khaanaa naseeb nahin hoga
 i was serious on my pledge, as well as confident that the Left would be out of power in 2018 itself
 tripura main left kii shikast ke baad maine 4 march ko machhlee khai
 What was the biggest challenge? In response to this question, Deodhar said that it was a big challenge to find and train good people
 rajya main adivaasiyon ke saath kaam karne se mujhe kaaphi khushi mili
 This was a big challenge
 hamaare kai yuva vidhayak hai jo party main padaadhikari bhi hai

 We first created state level leadership and then formed fronts across the state
 ab ye morcha jila str par maujuud hai
 After forming the Morcha, we focused on each assembly seat in the state, which we also call Mandal
 pehle party ke sirf 30 mandal hi sakriy the, baaki sabhi kagaji mahatv hi rakhte the
 We first activated all 60 mandals fully
 hamane booth level par bhi morcha banaae
 Gave the slogan 'ek Booth, 10 Youth'
 3200 booth ke liye 32000 yuvaaon ne samarpan bhaavana se kaam kiya
 Similarly, 25,000 enthusiastic women took part in Mahila Morcha rally in Tripura
 har booth par das mahila kaaryakartaaon ne bhi ghar-ghar jaakar logon tak party kaa sandesh pahunchaaya
 Similarly, Tribal Morcha, SC Morcha, Minority Morcha, Kisan Morcha were also formed at the booth level
 paanch booth ko milakar ek shakti centre banaaya gaya
 Altogether 600 Shakti Kendras were set up with one in-charge
 in shakti kendron kii niyamit baithken huin
 BJP workers report Carddevadhar told that every Thursday there were booth level party meetings
 phir shuukravaar ko mandal, shanivaar ko jila or ravivaar ko sabhi jilon kii agartala main baithak hoti thi
 This meeting was held under the leadership of me and Tripura BJP President Biplav Dev
 jahaan taaja sthiti kaa jayja liya jaataa tha
 Call centers were also run simultaneously
 dekha jaataa he ki sanghathan kii baithkon main har koi apni acchhee acchhee baaten hi upar ke netaaon tak pahunchaata he
 But then it was confirmed through call centers
 jahaan bhi khamiyaan dikhti, unhen dur kiya jaataa
 Modi Envoy Yojana Deodhar told that the modi-envoy scheme was implemented in Tripura
 isamen yuva modi kii tasveeron vaali kameezen, tapiyaan pahan kar chalate the saath hi wo postaron or parchon ke jariye logon tak centre main modi sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko bataate the
 Also, Manik used to question the government led government on various issues
 party kii muhim ke dauraan kai visham sthitiyon kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 Once i was returning from the rally, the nut bolts of my car tires were opened
 us vakt meri jaan bhi ja sakati thi
 This in itself tells how much intolerance was shown by the Left in the state

 Read Shams Tahir Khan's blogmehbuba refuted Sushma's statement on Tuesday, saying that she never praised Modi while Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said that Mehbooba's appreciation of Modi did not surprise him at all
 Happened
 sahil joshi kaa blogullekhneey he ki modi ke sadbhaavna mishan main pahunchi sushamaa ne somvaar ko kaha tha, 'adwani ji modi kii tarif karen to samajha ja saktaa he ki vah sneh se unki tarif kar rahe hai, main modi kii tarif karun to samajha ja saktaa he ki vah hamaari party ke mukhyamantri hai isliye unki tarif kar rahi hum
 But in a recent NIC meeting, Mehbooba Mufti, the leader of a fierce anti-pdp party, praised Modi
 'tasveeron main dekhen narendra modi kaa ab tak kaa safarnamamehabooba ne sushamaa ke bayaan kaa khandan karte hue kaha, 'meri baton ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya he
 i urge the Government of India to get a copy of my speech so that everything becomes clear
 ' unhone kaha, 'mujhe lagata he bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) niraash he
 i would ask him that if he needs Muslim leaders to prove his secularism, he should contact Farooq Abdullah, who praised Modi and said that he sees Allah in Modi's eyes
 'video: narendra modi bane siyasat kii khel ke bade khiladiumar abdulla par nishaanaa sadhate hue mehabooba ne kaha, 'umr us samay rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) kii sarkaar main mantri the jab gujarat main musalamaanon kaa katle aam hua tha

 Earlier, in an attempt to put Mehbooba in the dock, Omar tweeted, "I am not surprised at all by Mehbooba praising Modi
" vah jise pasand karti hai, uski tarif kar sakati hai
 i am surprised that others had also heard her speech and yet she is denying it
 'unhone kaha, 'khandan karne kii apeksha vah ise sweekaar kyon nahin kar raheen
 Instead of calling Sushma Swaraj's statement a lie, she should accept it

 '' There is good news
 acchhee khabar ye he ki hamaare desh kii sari samasyaayein samaapt ho chuki hai
 There is only one problem left
 garibi, berojgaare, kuposhan, sadak, aspataal kii samasyaon ke samaapt hone ke baad ab ek hi kaam bachaa he
 It is what we or you eat
 isse ghar-ghar main samay bachegaa or jidipi badhegi
 Soon a political party will start whatsapp by creating a personal menu for you every day
 mujhe lagata he ki aapako bhi khaanaa banane se pehle kisi political party ke daftar phone kar poochna chahie ki aaj kya bananaa he
 It will be told from the party office that there is a beef ban in the meat
 matan bain nahin he
 You can also ask any party to cook okra or eat mutton fry the day after tomorrow
 daal main hing se chhaunk lagaaein yaa jire kii chhaunk
 Well listen, do not hang up
 
 
 ye bhi bataa dijie na kal bachche ke tiffin main kya duun
 Egg or Tomato Vegetable
 chunki main ankar hum isliye partiyaan mujhe pakaa pakaaya pack kar bhijwa den to thik rahegaa
 The politics that is happening about meat ban in Maharashtra and the kind of language that is being used, it seems that after banning food one day, communities will also be banned
 philhal mumbai main kuch samay ke liye shivasena or maharashtra nav nirmaan sena ke kaaryakarta chikan bechate nazar aae
 If any so-called secular party had done this courage, the spokespersons would have attacked through the channels
 aksar shaakaahaar banaam maansaahaar kaa vivaad muslim virodh main badal jaataa he
 Hindutva parties tend to paint all Hindus as vegetarian
 lekin shivasena or manase ne yah saaf kar diya ki marathi maanush hindu to he magar maansaahaari he
 Shiv Sena leaders are speaking on TV that crores of people eat meat
 unke khaane ke adhikaar ke samarthan main shivasena ne chikan kaa thela tak laga diya
 In doing so, the hands of the secular parties started shaking
 lekin shivasena manase ke is saahas main ek samasya he
 If both of them are advocating the freedom of food, then how does the question of freedom of food of Muslims and Christians become different
 musalmaan or isai ke bif khaane se hindu aasthaa ko thes pahunchati he to is lihaaz se marathi maanush, jo ki hindu bhi hai, ke meet khaane se jain samudaay kii aasthaa aahat nahin ho sakati he
 The politics of food ban is directly related to bigotry
 agar aap kattarta ke ek rup ko manzuri denge to iske duusare swaroop ko bhi maananaa padegaa
 The supporter of bigotry can also be a victim of bigotry, this is clear from this case
 jaise jab bif bain ko lekar musalamaanon or isaayiyon ko target kiya gaya to jain samudaay hameshaa hindutv brigade kii taraf gin liya jaataa hoga
 Now the Jains have come on the target of those Hindutva parties
 in donon maamle main ek chiz kaaman he
 That is, Muslims, Christians and Jains are the three minorities
 jain bhi musalamaanon kii tarah kam se kam raajnneetik bolchaal main target ho rahe hai
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray wrote in the party mouthpiece Saamana, 'don't become a Jain fanatic
 unki dharmaandh maansikta unhen hinduon kaa dushman bana degi
 Just as fanatical Muslims became enemies of Hindus
 isliye paryushan kaa aadambar na kiya jaae
 Will Jain stop taking black money these days, urging him not to commit violence in Paryushan
 mumbai main zyaadaatar builder jain hai
 Will they not take black money in their deal during the period hinsa vichaaron main bhi hoti he
 Remember that in the 92-93 riots, the business of this Jain society was protected by the Shiv Sena
 or ye bhi naa bhoolen ki jain logon ke kaarobaar ko ukhaad phenkane main hamen zyaada samay nahin lagegaa
 Therefore, let me say that whatever you want to eat, let it be eaten
 ' Such a threat is not against anyone and society
 kya jain samaaj ke tushtikaran ke virodh ke naam par marathi maanush kaa tushtikaran nahin ho rahaa he
 Like Hindu appeasement in the name of Muslim appeasement
 jain samaaj ke samrajya ko nasht karne kii dhamkee dene vaali shivasena maharashtra or centre main bijepi kii sahyogi party he
 Shiv Sena is a minister in Modi government
 maharashtra main shivasena bijepi se milakar sarkaar chalaa rahi he
 Had it been the case of a Hindu Muslim, the patriots of the mercenaries who had tweeted as secular would have come, but even after such a threat to the Jain society, there is silence
 yah sawaal to pradhanmantri narendra modi se bhi poocha janaa chahie ki aapaki sahyogi party jain samaaj ko barbaad karne kii dhamkee de rahi he
 Will you make a tweet? haryana, rajasthan or gujarat main paryushan ke dauraan meet bain karne vaali bijepi mumbai main jain samaaj ke khilaaf ho rahi in baton ko kaise dekhati he
 Is he also silent as Jain appears silent
 kya isliye chup he ki uske saamaajik netaa muslim-isai virodh kii raajnneeti ke khilaaf khadey na ho sake yaa isliye chup hai ki unki koi nahin sunegaa
 Will the majority always decide in this country
 kya tay karne kii raajnneeti kaa laabh kabhi bhi alpsankhyak ko nahin milegaa
 Paryushan is a festival lasting eight to ten days
 kahin do din kaa meet bain he to kahin chaar din to kahin aath din
 Chicken is a ban on mutton, not a ban on fish
 machhlee kya afasaron kii file se uchhal kar marine drive se samandar main kud gai
 a large number of people stop carnivores during the month of Navratri and Sawan in North India including Delhi
 bihar main chhath ke dauraan maansaahaar band ho jaataa he lekin koi bain nahin karata
 Such demand also has its own problem
 ab yah baat nikal kar aa rahi he ki mumbai chah main jahaan gujarati, marwari or jain samaaj ke prabhaavshaalee logon kaa bahumat he vahaan ek bhi dukaan maansaahaar kaa nahin he
 It happened on its own or no non-vegetarian restaurant was allowed to open
 darasal sab apni apni kattarta ke maare hai
 But the ban on meat is not new
 ganesh chaturthi ke din bhi maansaahaar par roak hoti he
 This way the list can be long
 manase ne to prastaav paas kiya tha ki jo builder kisi maansaahaari ko flats nahin bechega uske khilaaf karrwai hogi
 The internet showed that in 2012 the Deputy Chief Minister of Karnataka State
 es
 When Ishwarappa was seen eating meat on the day of Gandhi Jayanti, the Congress petitioned the Governor against him that he should be sacked immediately as he had hurt the spirit of Gandhians
 ke
 s
 ishwarappa karnataka bhaajapa ke adhyaksh the
 The comments is bich yah maamla mumbai hoicourt bhi pahunch gaya he
 It will be heard on Friday as well
 adaalat ne apni shuruuaati tippanee main kaha he ki jain parv ke liye jaanwaron ko maarane or meet bechney par chaar din kii pabandi mubai jaise metropolitan shahar ke liye vyaavhaarik nahin he
 There can be no formula for such a direct ban on meat
 maarane or meet bechney par pabandi he
 What about other sources? What will happen to the pre-packaged meat in the market? uddhav thakare ji ne jain samaaj kaa jo chithran kiya he usase unhen bhi samasya honi chahie
 Everyone should be there
 lekin mumbai main zyaadaatar builder jain hai or ve kaala dhan lete hai yah sab pandrah lakh kii vatting list vaale phir se na chahakane lagen ki videsh se jab tak nahin aata tab tak jain vaala hi de dijie
 The joke is different ye acha nahin ho rahaa he
 i think you should also call the office of a political party before cooking and ask what to make today
 party aphis se bataaya jayega ki maansaahaar main bif bain he
 Mutton is not banned
 kisi dal se yah bhi puch sakate hai ki bhindi pakaa len yaa matan frai parason vaala kha len
 Add asafoetida or cumin seeds to the lentils
 acha suniye phone mat rakhiye
 
 
 Also tell me what should i give in the baby's tiffin tomorrow
 anda yaa tamaato kii sabji
 Since i am the anchor, parties will send me cooked and packed then it will be fine
 maharashtra main meet bain ko lekar jo raajnneeti ho rahi he or jis tarah kii bhashaa kaa istamaal ho rahaa he usase lag rahaa he ki ek din khaanaa bain karne ke baad samudaayon ko bhi bain kiya jayega
 Currently in Mumbai, Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena workers were seen selling chicken for some time
 ye himmat agar kisi tathakthith secular dal ne kii hoti to channelon ke zariye pravaktaaon ne dhaava bol diya hota
 Often the controversy of vegetarianism versus non-vegetarianism turns into Muslim opposition
 hindutvvaadi partiyaan sabhi hinduon ko shaakaahaari paint karne lagati hai
 But Shiv Sena and MNS made it clear that Marathi manush is Hindu but non-vegetarian
 shivasena ke netaa tivi par bol rahe hai ki karodon log maansaahaar karte hai
 In support of their right to eat, the Shiv Sena even set up a chicken cart
 aisa karne main secular dalon ke to haath kaanpane lagate
 But Shiv Sena MNS has a problem in this courage
 agar ye donon khaane kii azaadi kii vakaalat kar rahi hai to phir musalamaanon or isaayiyon ke khaane kii azaadi kaa sawaal alag kaise ho jaataa he
 Eating beef from Muslims and Christians hurts Hindu faith, so eating meat from Marathi Manush, who are also Hindus, cannot hurt the faith of the Jain community
 khaane par pratibandh kii raajnneeti kaa sambandh sidhaa sidhaa kattarta se he
 If you approve one form of bigotry, then another form of it has to be accepted
 kattarta kaa samarthak bhi kattarta kaa shikaar ho saktaa he is maamle se saaf ho jaataa he
 For example, when Muslims and Christians were targeted for beef ban, the Jain community would always be counted towards the Hindutva brigade
 ab unheen hindutv partiyon ke nishane par jain aa gaye hai
 In both these cases one thing is common
 wo ye ki musalmaan, isai or jain teenon alpsankhyak hai
 Jains, like Muslims, are targeting at least in political parlance
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne party mukhpatr saamana main likhaa he, 'jain dharmaandh na bane
 His fanatic mentality will make him an enemy of Hindus
 bilkul vaise hi jaise dharmaandh musalmaan hinduon ke dushman ban gaye
 Therefore, Paryusan should not be celebrated
 paryushan main hinsa naa karne kaa aagrah karte jain kya in dinon blike mani lenaa band kar denge
 Most builders in Mumbai are Jain
 kya ve apane saude main paryushan kaal main kaala dhan nahin lenge
 Violence also occurs in thoughts
 yaad rakhen ki 92-93 ke dangon main is jain samaaj ke kaarobaar kii raksha shivasena ne kii thi
 And also do not forget that it will not take long for us to uproot the business of Jain people
 isliye kah detaa hum ki jise jo khaanaa he, khaane do
 ' aisi dhamkee kisi samaaj ko or kisi ko etraz tak nahin
 Is not the appeasement of Marathi manus in the name of protesting the appeasement of Jain society
 jaise muslim tushtikaran ke naam par hindu tushtikaran hota he
 The Shiv Sena is a BJP ally in Maharashtra and the Center, threatening to destroy the Jain Samaj empire
 modi sarkaar main shivasena kaa mantri he
 In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena is running a government consisting of the BJP
 hindu muslim vaala maamla hota to secular ko sicular bataakar twit karne vaale bhaade ke deshbhakt aa jate lekin jain samaaj ko aisi dhamkee ke baad bhi chuppi nazar aati he
 This question should also be asked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that your ally party is threatening to ruin Jain society
 kya aap koi twit karenge
 How the BJP, which banned meat during paryushan in Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat, sees these things happening against the Jain community in Mumbai
 kya wo bhi chup he jaise jain chup nazar aate hai
 Is it silent that its social leaders cannot stand against the politics of muslim-christian opposition or is silent that no one will listen to them
 kya is mulk main hameshaa bahusankhyak tay karegaa
 Whether the minority will never get the benefit of politics of deciding
 paryushan parv aath se das dinon tak chalane vaala parv he
 Somewhere there is a meat ban of two days, then four days and somewhere eight days
 chikan, matan par bain he, machhlee par bain nahin
 Did the fish jump from the officers' file and jumped into the sea from Marine Drive
 dilli sahit puure uttar bharat main navaratri or sawan ke maheene main badi sankhya main log maansaahaar band kar dete hai
 In Bihar, carnivore stops during Chhath but no ban
 is tarah kii maang kii bhi apni ek samasya he
 Now it is coming out that where there is a majority of influential people of Gujarati, Marwari and Jain society in Mumbai six, there is not a single store of meat
 yah apane aap ho gaya yaa kisi maansaahaari restraan ko khulne nahin diya gaya
 Actually everyone is killed due to his bigotry
 lekin maansaahaar par bain koi nai baat nahin he
 On the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, non-vegetarian food is banned
 is tarah suchi lambii ho sakati he
 The MNS had passed a resolution that the builder who does not sell flats to a non-vegetarian would take action
 internet se pataa chalaa ki 2012 main karnataka rajya ke up mukhyamantri ke
 s
 ishwarappa gandhi jayanti ke din maansaahaar karte dekhe gaye to congress ne unke khilaaf rajyapal ko yachika di ki unhen turant barkhaast kar diya jaae kyonki unhone gandhivadiyon kii bhaavana ko thes pahunchaai he

 The court, in its opening remarks, stated that a four-day ban on killing animals and selling meat for the Jain festival is not practical for a metropolitan city like Mumbai
 meet par aisi sidhi pabandi koi formula nahin ho sakati
 There is a ban on killing and selling meats
 anya sroton kaa kya? bazaar main pehle se maujuud packaged meet kaa kya hoga? He should also have a problem with the portrayal of Jain society by Uddhav Thackeray
 sabhi ko to honi hi chahie
 But most of the builders in Mumbai are Jains and they take black money
 All of them with a waiting list of fifteen lakhs do not start saying that till the time they come from abroad, they should give away the Jain ones

 This is not going well
 chunki main ankar hum isliye partiyaan mujhe pakaa pakaaya pack kar bhijwa den to thik rahegaa
 The politics that is happening about meat ban in Maharashtra and the kind of language that is being used, it seems that after banning food one day, communities will also be banned
 philhal mumbai main kuch samay ke liye shivasena or maharashtra nav nirmaan sena ke kaaryakarta chikan bechate nazar aae
 If any so-called secular party had done this courage, the spokespersons would have attacked through the channels
 aksar shaakaahaar banaam maansaahaar kaa vivaad muslim virodh main badal jaataa he
 Hindutva parties tend to paint all Hindus as vegetarian
 lekin shivasena or manase ne yah saaf kar diya ki marathi maanush hindu to he magar maansaahaari he
 Shiv Sena leaders are speaking on TV that crores of people eat meat
 unke khaane ke adhikaar ke samarthan main shivasena ne chikan kaa thela tak laga diya
 In doing so, the hands of the secular parties started shaking
 lekin shivasena manase ke is saahas main ek samasya he
 If both of them are advocating the freedom of food, then how does the question of freedom of food of Muslims and Christians become different
 musalmaan or isai ke bif khaane se hindu aasthaa ko thes pahunchati he to is lihaaz se marathi maanush, jo ki hindu bhi hai, ke meet khaane se jain samudaay kii aasthaa aahat nahin ho sakati he
 The politics of food ban is directly related to bigotry
 agar aap kattarta ke ek rup ko manzuri denge to iske duusare swaroop ko bhi maananaa padegaa
 The supporter of bigotry can also be a victim of bigotry, this is clear from this case
 jaise jab bif bain ko lekar musalamaanon or isaayiyon ko target kiya gaya to jain samudaay hameshaa hindutv brigade kii taraf gin liya jaataa hoga
 Now the Jains have come on the target of those Hindutva parties
 in donon maamle main ek chiz kaaman he
 That is, Muslims, Christians and Jains are the three minorities
 jain bhi musalamaanon kii tarah kam se kam raajnneetik bolchaal main target ho rahe hai
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray wrote in the party mouthpiece Saamana, 'don't become a Jain fanatic
 unki dharmaandh maansikta unhen hinduon kaa dushman bana degi
 Just as fanatical Muslims became enemies of Hindus
 isliye paryushan kaa aadambar na kiya jaae
 Will Jain stop taking black money these days, urging him not to commit violence in Paryushan
 mumbai main zyaadaatar builder jain hai
 Will they not take black money in their deal during the period hinsa vichaaron main bhi hoti he
 Remember that in the 92-93 riots, the business of this Jain society was protected by the Shiv Sena
 or ye bhi naa bhoolen ki jain logon ke kaarobaar ko ukhaad phenkane main hamen zyaada samay nahin lagegaa
 Therefore, let me say that whatever you want to eat, let it be eaten
 ' Such a threat is not against anyone and society
 kya jain samaaj ke tushtikaran ke virodh ke naam par marathi maanush kaa tushtikaran nahin ho rahaa he

 For example, when Muslims and Christians were targeted for beef ban, the Jain community would always be counted towards the Hindutva brigade
 ab unheen hindutv partiyon ke nishane par jain aa gaye hai
 In both these cases one thing is common
 wo ye ki musalmaan, isai or jain teenon alpsankhyak hai
 Jains, like Muslims, are targeting at least in political parlance
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne party mukhpatr saamana main likhaa he, 'jain dharmaandh na bane
 His fanatic mentality will make him an enemy of Hindus
 bilkul vaise hi jaise dharmaandh musalmaan hinduon ke dushman ban gaye
 Therefore, Paryusan should not be celebrated
 paryushan main hinsa naa karne kaa aagrah karte jain kya in dinon blike mani lenaa band kar denge
 Most builders in Mumbai are Jain
 kya ve apane saude main paryushan kaal main kaala dhan nahin lenge
 Violence also occurs in thoughts
 yaad rakhen ki 92-93 ke dangon main is jain samaaj ke kaarobaar kii raksha shivasena ne kii thi

 Mayawati said that after seeing the news about the IPL through newspapers and television channels for a few days, it seems that serious irregularities in this case, illegal foreign money investment, betting etc
 All the information was with the Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate of the Central Government for a long time, yet these institutions have made all the irregularities due to unknown reasons
 In a way to re-laid to provide acquiescence and let go of the seemingly high level of pressure they were sitting close all institutions eye ear
 unhone kaha ki congress ke netritv vaali kendra sarkaar ko is maamle main desh kii aam janata ko yah bataanaa chahie ki vah kya paristhitiyaan thi yaa aise koun-koun se kaaran the ki pichley do-teen varshon se in kathith karnaamon par inakam tex vibhaag evam pravartan nideshaalay pardaa daale rahaa
 Chief Minister Mayawati said that during the Lok Sabha elections, our party had demanded to bring back the trillion rupees of our country deposited abroad and had also promised the people that if our party came to power, it would bring back the black money stashed abroad
 a strict law will be enacted immediately
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki us samay congress, bhaajapa evam anya dalon ne ne videshon main avaidh dhang se jamaa kharbon rapayon ko turant waapas laane kii baat kahi thi, lekin satta main waapas aate hi congress party apni baton se mukar gayi
 He said that far from bringing back the black money stashed abroad, by adopting various tricks, the way of allowing black money to enter the country was cleared, a living example of which is the Indian Premier League
 mayawati ne kaha ki jab avaidh dhan kii kamai ko lekar kendra sarkaar main shaamil mantrigan hi aapas main bhid gayi or sara maamla aam janata kii jaankaree main aa gaya tab jaakar majaburi main congress ke netritv vaali kendra kii sarkaar ne inakam tex vibhaag or pravartan nideshaalay aadi ko is maamle main jaanch karne ke liye kaha
 He said that now a parliamentary committee should be set up immediately to investigate the matter without delay, only then the whole truth of IPL will be revealed to the public or else due to the huge number of people involved in this case, there is a lot of money, corruption and huge amount of billions Another scandal of black money being planted in the country will remain buried in the files
 iske saath hi unhone maang kii ki is prakaran main jo bhi mantrigan or anya mahatvapurn padon par baithe jimmedaar log shaamil hai unase turant istipha le lenaa chahie

 The Aam Aadmi Party has issued a complaint letter to an MCD official, in which Mayor Preity Aggarwal has been accused of corruption

 aam aadmi partiki ore se jari shikayati khat main adhikari ne shiksha vibhaag main transfar posting kaa bhi aarope priti agarwal par lagaaya he
 The officer has also mentioned in the letter to the commissioner that the mayor had also organized a grand dinner party at his house some time ago, which cost Rs 5 lakh and it was against the payment of the dinner rules
 meyar kii in karatuuton ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane par adhikari ke saath badsulki ke bhi aarope lagaae gaye hai
 AAP has demanded the immediate dismissal of the mayor from the BJP and a CBI probe against him
 maamla lagaataar tool pakadta ja rahaa he or isse bijepi kii chhavi par asar pad rahaa he, jinhone janata kaa vishwaas nae chehre, nai urja or nai udaan ke sahare hasil kiya tha

 agarwal ne chunauti di he ki vah jald hi aam aadmi party ke tamaam un leaders par jo unka naam kharaab kar rahe hai, un par manahani kaa cese karengi
 Obviously, both sides are demanding each other's resignation

 The copy of the declaration will first be tested by the Chief Electoral Officer

 Political parties are viewing this decision of the Election Commission from their political prism

 sanjay hegadekuch samay pehle dilli main ek heritage walk (smarak-bhraman) ke dauraan main kuch doston ke saath humayun kaa makbara dekhne gaya tha
 i was accompanied by a female journalist and before turning to the World Heritage Memorial in central Delhi, she turned to her college student son and started telling him a part of her personal history
 jahaan ham khadey the, uske saamne sadak kii duusari ore nizamuddin thana tha
 Pointing to him, he said, "during the emergency, your daddy was arrested and kept in the same police station
" '' unke mashhoor raajnneetik pati un dinon jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay main chaatr netaa hua karte the
 Later while talking to the young lawyers in my office, i told them the communication between the mother and son and put a question in front of them, "imagine that i have been taken into custody in such a situation and you have been arrested in the Supreme Court, Where i practice daily, i have to file a writ petition for bail
 
 
 aap mujhe un nyaayadhishon ke naam bataaen jinke saamne yachika rakhane par aapako jamaanat aadesh jarur mil jayega
 "perhaps you have guessed that the answer to this question was not very encouraging
" apane daftar kii is kahani ko aapke saamne rakhane kii vajah yah he ki is samay desh bhar main kai vakil bina sunwaayee ke jail main pade hai or adaalatein jahiraa taur par unhen reeha karne main aksham hai
 'jail, not bail' is the basic rule in the cases under consideration, yet the investigating agencies consider it as a normal development and make unnecessary and illegitimate arrests
 unhen aisa karne kaa hausala shaayad is baat se miltaa he ki zyaadaatar maamalon main adaalatein jamaanat dene se manaa kar detii hai
 Our courts consider the release of someone on bail as a condition of profit and in cases of investigation incomplete, the exception of those accused of a crime is ordered to be released on bail with the exception of those who are most eligible for it
 isi vajah se, agar rajnatik ishaaron par chal rahi karypalika badla lene kii bhaavana se prerit hokar hiraasat main rakhane par amada ho to mashhoor vakil bhi apni aazaadee ke prati aashwast nahin ho sakate
 Despite that they were not even near the place of the violent incident on New Year's Day in 2018, Nagpur's lawyer Surendra Gadling, accused in the bhima-koregaon case, has been in jail since June 2018

K
 chidambaram sitambar 2019 kii shuruyaat se jail main hai
 He was granted bail by the Supreme Court in the case registered by CBI, yet he is still in jail after Diwali and because the Enforcement Directorate (ED) also based on the facts on which the CBI had registered a case against him
 Another case has been registered against him
 idi maamle main giraftaar aise samay par kii gai jisase sunishchit ho sake ki agar supreme court sibiai maamle main jamaanat de bhi de, to bhi ve tab tak reeha na ho saken jab tak ki unhen anya maamle main bhi jamaanat na mil jaae
 When the system quietly accepted the case of Gadling being sent to jail, then there were indications that others like Bhardwaj and Chidambaram were also in a weak position

 The Supreme Court has not stood up for the safety of its own judges
 san 2011 main gujarat ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayamurti jayant patel ne ishrat jahaan maamle main sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh diya tha
 In 2016, he was transferred to the Karnataka High Court
 iske baad 2017 main unhen elahabaad sthanantarit kar diya gaya, jisase ve karnataka main kaaryvahak mukhya nyaayadhish nahin ban sake
 He then chose a way to resign from the post
 san 2019 main aisa hi vakya tab hua jab supreme court ne madras hycourt kii mukhya nyaayadhish vijaya tahilarmaani kaa sthanantaran meghalaya karne kii sanstuti kii
 In 2010, Justice Akil Qureshi of the Gujarat High Court decided to give Amit Shah custody of CBI in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case
 is faisle ke parinaam tabhi se unke peshaagat jivan ko nakaaratmak rup se prabhavit kar rahe hai
 He was transferred to the Mumbai High Court from which he could not become the acting Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court
 unka naam madhya pradesh hycourt ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke liye sujhaayaa gaya, lekin centre sarkaar ne collegium kii sanstuti par karrwai hi nahin kii
 The collegium has now recommended that he be made the Chief Justice of Tripura, but the government is hanging that recommendation as well

 The obedient judiciary and the intimidated advocate community can never discharge their constitutional obligation employed as a control and balance mechanism on which good governance rests
 pakistan kaa ek udhaaharan is bindu kaa vivaran behatar tareeke se de saktaa he
 In 1954, Chief Justice of Pakistan Muhammad Munir applied the 'principle of necessity' on behalf of Governor General Malik Ghulam Muhammad to legitimize the dismissal of the Constituent Assembly
 unhone bracton ke siddhant kaa hawala diya, ''jo baat anyathaa vaid nahin he, use aavashyaktaa ke anusaar vaid banaaya jaataa he''—or is tarah se unhone satta hadapney kii karravaayiyon ko vaid tehraane kii puri shrunkhlaa shuru kar di
 In the following decades, that country broke up, the Pakistani judiciary collapsed and had to vow allegiance to military dictators like Ziaul Haq
 march 2007 main, jab general musharraf ne mukhya nyaayadhish iftikhar choudhary ko barkhaast karnaa chaha to unhen behaal karaane ke liye vakeelon ko sadakon par virodh pradarshan karnaa padaa
 Returning to India, the conditions here are also unfortunate

 Nearly 40 years after that, along with calls to celebrate India's real and imagined civilizational achievements, all organs of the state, including the judiciary, are being greed and threats to follow the dictates of power

 In this era of social media choices, there is a growing tendency among Indians to renounce their sense of freedom
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke bheeshan daur main die ek prasiddh bhaashan main, justise billings larned hand ne ise paribhaashit karte hue kaha tha, ''yah aisi bhaavana he jise ekadam sunishchit rup se nahin pataa he ki vah sahi he yaa nahin; swatantraaa kii bhaavana vah bhaavana he jo duusare logon ke man ko samajhane kii koshish karti he; swatantraaa kii bhaavana vah bhaavana he jo bina pakshpaat ke dusron ke hiton ko apane hiton se taulti he
 "they did not stop at this and also warned:" Freedom resides in people's hearts; And, when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it; No constitution, no law or any court can do much in its help
 ''kya aaazaad bharat apni aazaadee ko uski vaastavik bhaavana ke saath mahatv detaa he, yaa yah keval dikhaawati aazaadee bhar se santusht he? iskaa jawaab bharat kii adaalaton se nahin balki logon se aana he

 Ismail is challenging some comments made in the 1994 verdict of the apex court in the Farooqui case
 misaal ke taur par us faisle main kaha gaya tha kiislam ke anuyaayiyon ke liye namaaj padhane kii khatirmasjid abhinn hissaa nahin he
 The constitutional validity of the Acquisition Act 1993 of certain areas in Ayodhya was considered in the judgment on the Farooqui case
 is kanoon ke jariye centre ne vivaadit sthal or paas kii kuch jameen kaa tab adhigrahan kiya tha
 a special bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice SA Nazir said, "first we should end this dispute on the 1994 verdict
" ham puure faisle yaa uske kuch hisse ko badi peeth ke paas bhej sakate hai
 Describing the comments of the verdict as important, senior advocate Rajiv Dhawan said that this needs to be reconsidered by a five-judge bench and effectively address civil appeals without correcting these discrepancies in aspects such as the mosque's position in Islam in the verdict
 Cannot be decided
 unhone kaha, ‘‘vidhwans ke baavjood koi masjid, masjid hi rahata he or yah allaah kaa hota he
 "referring to some paragraphs of the 1994 judgment, Dhawan said," The apex court had said that reciting or offering prayers is a religious act
 kisi bhi sthaan par yah kaam karnaa, jahaan namaaj padhi ja sakati he vah aisi dharmik pratha kaa tab tak anivaary yaa abhinn hissaa nahin hoga jab tak ki us sthaan kaa us dharm ke liye khaas mahatv ho, taaki uskaa anivaary yaa abhinn hissaa ho
 He said that in the judgment it was said that once the mosque is offered, it will always remain a place of worship as a mosque, it is not the Muslim law of India which has been approved by the Indian courts
 adaalat ne kaha tha, ‘‘samvidhan ke anuchhed 25 or anuchhed 26 ke tahat sangrakshan kii shart par masjid, carch, mandir jaise dharmik ibaadat sthalon kaa rajya kii adhigrahan kii samprabhu shaktiyon ke tahat unka adhigrahan kiya ja saktaa he
 Dhawan quoted the 1994 verdict as saying, "such acquisitions do not automatically violate Article 25 or Article 26
" prabandhan ko apane niyantran main lene kaa sampatti kaa adhigrahan karne ke sambandh main rajya kii samprabhu shaktiyon par koi prabhaav nahin he
 Dhawan quoted the decision as saying, "it is a completely different matter that the area has now been acquired
" kya aap kah sakate hai ki agar kisi masjid ko dhwast kar diya jaataa he to vah masjid nahin rah jaataa he
 He said that in the 1994 judgment it was said that the fundamental right of worship does not extend to the place of worship
 ram lalaa or nirmohi akhaada kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe vakeelon ne is daleel kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki 1994 ke faisle kaa maujuuda maamle se koi lenaa- dena nahin he

 The people of this village are ready to vote in the name of BJP leader Modi, so that his dream can be fulfilled

 Most of the villagers supported Hembrom's ideas

 This village, named Pakistan, comes from the district headquarters Purnia town, about 30 km from the Singhia panchayat of Srinagar block
 sthaneey media ke mutabik, pakistan ke ek anya nivasee haldu murmu ne kaha, 'pakistan ke log modi ko pradhanmantri ke rup main dekhne ke liye bijepi ko vot denge
 'the most interesting thing is that there is not a single Muslim community home in this village

 He said, 'only Modi can do this
 'purniya main 24 april ko matdaan hoga
 According to a police officer, the name of this village is also Pakistan in the official records
 yah puche jane par ki is gaanv kaa naam pakistan kaise padaa, gaanv ke bujurgon ne bataaya ki 1947 main vibhaajan ke turant baad hi iskaa naam pakistan rakh diya gaya tha

 'there is poverty and illiteracy in this Pakistan

 Despite this, anti-pakistan sentiment dominates the village

 Meenakshi Lekhi accused the Congress of dividing people on the basis of religion and ruining the economy

 Kola Boo said, 'for me he was the most brilliant man
 ' par dhire dhire uskaa cheharaa benakaab hota gaya or phir to wo cola ke liye ek balaatkaari se zyada kuch bhi nahin rah gaya
 According to Kola Boo, Laden had a desire to have divine powers in himself and he dreamed of healing the whole world

 Immediately, there was a statement from the Congress about this list being fake

 The case came to light when Congress leader and Chhattisgarh in-charge PL Punia declared the first list of candidates to be fake

 This list came under happiness from the seal seal of Congress General Secretary Girish Dewangan

 The Congress official Girish Dewangan's seal was leaked and this list was leaked, he neither denied it nor called it fake

 It is being speculated that this list was finalized after the opinion of the observers

 The police were hopeful that they would get some clues from the post-mortem report, but the cause of death was not clear in the post-mortem report
 police ne donon kaa bisraa forencik jaanch ke liye agra lab bhijwaya he
 After all the investigation so far, it is feared that both of them may have died due to some poison
 or jehar kaa pataa bisraa jaanch ke baad hi ho paaegaa
 It is to be known that Neeraj and Ruchi Singhania's dead bodies were found in their bathroom on Holi last Friday
 is maamle main abhi tak hatya yaa khudakushi kaa koi saboot saamne nahin aayaa he
 After preliminary investigation, it appears that Geiger in the bathroom died of suffocation after gas leaked
 doctoron ke pahunchane se 3 ghante pehle ho chuki thi moutajatak kii team maiks hospital ke un doctoron tak ja pahunchi, jo sabase pehle ghatnasthal par pahunche the
 His team took stock
 doctor dhiraj bhaskar ne ajtak ko bataaya ki jab unki team maukey par pahunchi, to vahaan par donon ke shavon ko kapade pahana die gaye the
 One body was placed in the car, while one body was placed at the door of the house
 yani is maut ke peeche kuch to aisa he jo abhi bhi parde ke peeche he
 The doctor says that by that time, the bodies of both of them had become cold, that is, the death had taken place at least two to three hours earlier
 in sawaalon ke jawaab dhund rahi he pulishai prophine job vaale is khubasurat jode kii maut ab tak police ke liye gutthi bani hui he
 The police is investigating several angles to resolve this problem
 haalanki ghatana se jude kuch sawaal aise hai, jinke uttar dhunde jane kii jarurat he
 So far, the most obvious reason behind the death of both is being told that the gas leaked from the geyser
 lekin ahm sawaal yah he ki gas kaa asar pati or patni donon par ek jaisaa kaise ho saktaa he?agar food poisoning ke kaaran maut maane to us paristhiti main peedit kuch sangharsh karata he
 But no trace of conflict has been found at the site of the incident
 maut se pehle donon ne ulti bhi nahin kii he, isliye food poisoning kii sambhaavna bhi na ke baraabar hi he
 The police have found some drug rappers by chance, but those drugs are the cause of death, it is not yet clear nor has anything like this come out in the post mortem report
 donon kii maut ekasaath kaise hui, yah sawaal bhi police ko pareshaan kiye hue hai
 Family is keeping distance from media and on the other hand, the victim family is completely distanced from media
 police sutron kii maane to parivaar police se jaanch kii maang bhi nahin kar rahi he
 Apart from this, the family members have also blocked accounts of all the social media, on which their friends were writing condolences after the death
 gijar ho sakati he maut kii vajahexport kii maane to alpiji gijar se paidaa hone vaali aag ke kaaran oxigen kii khapat main kami aa jaati he
 Along with this, carbon monoxide is also produced
 dimag main oxigen kii kami jaanaleva ho sakati he
 In this case also it may be that Neeraj and Ruchi have gone to the bathroom to take a bath after Holi
 pani garm karne ke liye unhone gijar chalaaya ho
 During this time, there was a lack of oxygen due to gas leaking from the geyser and they died due to inhalation 
 postmortem report main dimag or fefde main avrodh kii vajah se maut bataai gai he
 At present, the police is knowing the cause of death
 parijanon kaa gijar istemaal hone se inkaardanpati kii maut kaa yah maamla isliye bhi pechida ho chalaa he kyonki jahaan unki maut kii sabase vaazib vajah gijar se gas risaav ke chalate dam ghutana lag rahi he
 At the same time, the relatives say that both did not use the geyser
 police ne bataaya ki mrit pati-patni donon ke jism par koi kapadaa nahin tha
 Neeraj was DGM in the mobile company Matrix
 ruchi america iti company main job karti thi
 The two were married in 2010
 unki 4 saal kii ek bacchee bhi he
 Let us tell you that the death toll due to gas leaking in the bathroom has increased rapidly

 Due to lack of solidarity among the opposition parties, the Modi government was successful in getting the Muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill passed by the Rajya Sabha declaring triple talaq as a crime in the second term
 endie ke kuch sahyogi dalon sahit vipaksh kii tamaam partiyaan shuru se hi teen talaak bill kaa virodh karti rahi hai, lekin mangalvaar ko is par ucch sadan main voting hui to inamen se kuch walkout kar gaye or kai saansad anupasthit rahe
 During the debate on the bill, Vijay Sai of YSR Congress said that i oppose the bill for 6 reasons
 pehali baat to ye jab talaak maanya hi nahin ho to kis aadhaar par giraftaar aadi kaa praavdhaan he? doosraa, jab pati jail main hoga to vah guzaara bhatta kaise degaa? teesri baat 3 saal kii jail se shaadi ke rishte ke dobaaraa panpane kii sambhaavna bilkul khatm ho jaaegi
 But Vijay Sai was absent in the House during voting
 basapa saansad satish chandra mishra kaa kahana tha ki hamaari party is bill ke khilaaf he or ise select cameti ke paas bheja janaa chahie
 He said that the Supreme Court has rejected it and you want to bring it back into existence again
 is bill se mahilaayein sabase zyada pratadit hone vaali hai kyonki purush ke jail jane ke baad mahilaayein bhi kahin kii nahin rah jaaengi
 The government will look after the children and not give alimony to the women, so how will their lives go
 teen talaak par is tarah mukhar hone ke baavjood basapa kaa koi saansad sadan main upasthit nahin tha
 NCP MP Majid Memon also opposed the bill
 unhone kaha ki kaha ki aap kisi ko bagaiyr aparaadh ke 3 saal kii sajaa dene ja rahe hai, talaak kahana koi aparaadh nahin he
 Even after going to jail, the marriage will not end and the woman will have to go to the magistrate for alimony
 jail main rah rahaa pati kaise patni ko bhatta de paaegaa, aise main kanoon fail ho gaya
 If the woman stays in her husband's house then why will she be given alimony
