 What is the point where the two meet? Acharya Rajneesh has compared samadhi to the extreme pleasure of sexual intercourse
 unki atyant lokapriy pustak kaa naam hi he sambhog se samadhi kii ore
 Have i ever experienced this samadhi myself? Whenever sex attention comes, the queen stands in front
 is hnetra main vahi meri shikshika or sahachari he
 Rani was so open and sleepy from the beginning that i felt small in front of her
 
 
 shaayad pehali baar sampurna sambhog ranikhet main hua tha
 i ran from Delhi to Ranikhet to write a novel and found out that a room with a pensioner elder could be found in a place called Sarna Estate nearby
 ek-dedh furlongs bas stand se neeche jaakar maine saraswati das pathak naam ke bujurg se mulaakaat kii
 He said that i have rented this entire guesthouse myself and i will give you a room
 
 
 ve kabhi mujhe ek naam se nahin pukaarte the
 Sometimes Rajendar used to say, sometimes Upendra
 us samay main andekhee anjaan pul likh rahaa tha or maine rani ko vahaan bula liya tha
 He told the old man that he is my sister-in-law and loves me very much
 rani jab bas stand par utari to main ullasit ho uthaa
 But we have never been so emotional about meeting or getting separated that we can cling to each other
 maine uske aagaman kii puri taiyaari kar rakhi thi
 He also took a quarter of rum from the bus station in the evening
 ab raat kaa vah kshan tha, jisaki shaayad ham donon hi badi utkatataa se pratiksha kar rahe the
 After the initial pressing and kissing, i wore a condom brought to the occasion (then called French Leather) and as soon as the queen tried to enter, she quickly threw out the condom that someone else in our midst threw
 Is not needed is tarah hamaara vah pehla sampurna sambhog sampann hua
 In the morning, the queen showed her a blood-colored sheet and went downstairs to wash it with other clothes
 un saat dinon main shaayad hamane darjanon baar bina raat-din dekhe rati-kriyaayein kin
 Meanwhile, a small incident happened
 ek baar param santoshjanak rati-kriya ke baad usne meri chaati par mukke maarthe hue kaha ki tumne mujhe paanch-chah saalon tak is sukh se vanchit kyon rakhaa? yah sab kuch pehle bhi to ho saktaa tha, to kiya kyon nahin? maine kaha ki tumhiin haath rakhane nahin detii thi
 So said that you could not force a little? i assumed that was my fault
 lekin main to yahi sochakar baitha rahaa ki jab jarurat baraabar kii he to jabardastee kyon? udhar se pahal hogi tabhi main aage badhoonga
 This incident still haunts me sometimes
 baad main isi sthiti par lakshmana rekha kahani likhi
 
 
 After this, the queen was the longest with kullu-manali in a place named Raisin
 kalkatte kii aabhohawaa main mujhe saans kii ek beemaari ho gai
 
 
 Shyamanand Jalan advised that you should stay for some days at a height of a mountain where there is a field and there is not much climbing and landing
 
 
 main agra se rani ke saath hi rysin pahunchaa
 Then she stayed with me for almost a month
 
 
 rani khaanaa banaati or ham log vakt-bevakt ghanghor sambhog main lage rahete
 In the evening, Vyas used to go for a walk on the river, which was just across the road
 
 
 khayr, rani ke saath ke ye saare prem-prasang aisi dharohar hai ki inhen main kisi ke saath baant bhi nahin saktaa
 xxrep 5 * So can i conclude that those whose sex life is full of satisfaction and fulfillment, they are not worried about God or God and for them death is hidden in the future like an event which will come when Will come
 yah anand kii anubhuti kii vah dabangai he, jo hamen sansar kii parvaah na karne kaa jajba detii he yaa antat: yah kisi nai rachana kii prakriya he, jahaan aap sahagaamini ke madhyam se apane hi praturup ko saakaar karte hai
 We are the creators
 duusare kisi sarjak kii parvaah kyon karen? xxrep 5 * sambhoganand or mrityu ke sameekaran par baat karte hue kabhi mujhe apane aap ko gaaliyaan dene kaa man nahin hua
 No matter how bad i am for the world, i have tried to be as honest and truthful towards myself
 is baat se kaise inkaar karata ki rani meri aantarik jarurat he

 She was addressing the stage at a function in Pune
 khaas baat he ki yah manch sthaneey congressi netaa patangrao kadam kii sanstha dwaara yojit kaarykram ke liye bana tha
 With his statement, Pankaja Munde has exposed the discipline of BJP
 ise maujuuda mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke liye kirakiri bhi mana ja rahaa he
 Pankaja said in her speech, 'she does not know whether she will ever become CM or not
 lekin, aaj bhi wo jahaan bhi jaati hai alag-alag dalon ke logon se unhen siem hone jaisaa hi anubhav miltaa he
 And it is a pleasant thing for him to be the CM of the public mind, the basic mantra of victory
 pankaja munde rajya kii bijepi sarkaar main pehali baar cabinet mantri bani hai
 She had been a Member of Parliament before this
 pankaja ke mukhyamantri pad ko lekar die bayaan se party ke andar mukhyamantri pad ke liye jari ghamaasan khulkar saamne aa gaya he
 However, this is not the first time that Pankaja has been offered a claim for the post of Chief Minister
 rajya vidhansabha chunaav se ain pehle bhi unhone aisa hi bayaan diya tha
 The comments vaise mukhyamantri pad ko lekar akeli pankaja munde nahin, rajasav mantri ekanath khadse bhi daavedaari jataa chuke hai
 Khadse said soon after the formation of the BJP government in the state that the Chief Minister belonged to the Bahujan Samaj

 Whereas the high command did not mind it

 However, the caste equation of the state is also responsible for this arrogance

 Amidst the exercise to form a government, Khadse had told his attitude that he wanted to become CM

 This arrogance in the new fledgling BJP government in Maharashtra from the beginning of the Chief Minister's post is still intact

 The leaders, expressing their desire to become the Chief Minister, are being hurt by the Brahmin occupation in this post

 team india ke liye ek acchhee khabar yah bhi he ki ‘sixsar king’ naam se mashhoor yuvaraj singh or tej gendbaaj mohit sharma aaj ke match ke liye feet ghoshit kar die gaye hai
 On Wednesday, Yuvraj suffered an ankle injury during the football session
 bhartiya team ke saamne sabase badi duvidha yah he ki kharaab form main chal rahe shikhar dhawan kii jagah ajinkya rahane ko barkaraar rakhaa jaae yaa nahin
 Apart from this, whether Mohit Sharma, who replaced Mohammed Shami in the last match, should be fielded or not
 mohit sharma ko bhi aaj ke match ke liye feet ghoshit kiya gaya he
 Despite being an aggressive batsman, Dhawan could not do much in the tournament, replacing Rahane in the last match
 yuvaraj ke feet hone ke baad ab dhoni kii musiibat ye he ki rahane ko team main rakhaa jaae yaa dhawan ko antim 11 main jagah di jaae
 The match will also be played by Virat Kohli and spinners Imran Tahir and Rohit Sharma and fast bowler Dale Steyn
 maujuuda form ke aadhaar par bharat kaa palada baari lag rahaa he, lekin tii20 cricket main jeet haar kaa faisla mahaj teen overon main ho jaataa he
 India has won the last four matches while South Africa has won three of the four matches

 The Indian spinner would like to retain his dominance on the sher-e-bangla stadium's pitch, while South Africa's attack would be on AB de Villiers and Kinton de Kock
 nange pair se footbal match khilne ke dauraan yuvaraj ko lagi chot ne dhoni and company ko chintit kar diya tha, lekin ab unki ye tension khatm ho gai he
 Yuvraj scored 60 off 43 balls in the last match against Australia after a poor performance in the opening matches
 dhawan ne tii20 world cap ke teen maichon main 31 ran banaae hai
 He played very poorly against the West Indies and Bangladesh
 practice seshan main haalanki ve sabase pehle maidan par utarate hai, lekin match main chal nahin paa rahe
 Now Dhoni will have to decide whether Dhawan will start the innings with Rohit Sharma or Rahane
 tej gendbaaji main bhubaneshwar kumaar ke jodidar kaa chayan bhi chintaa kaa sabab he

 Mohit Sharma performed well in the last match
 mohit ne watasan ko of kattar par out kiya
 Mohit and Bhuvneshwar bowling at the same pace and variety, while Shami is the bowler of higher speed than them
 dakshin africa kii ummiden duniya ke number ek tej gendbaaj sten par tiki hongi, jinhone chaar maichon main nau wicket liye hai
 It will also be a real test for leg-spinner Imran Tahir

 Bangladesh started well and hit the Indian bowlers relentlessly, but the hosts bounced back and restricted Bangladesh to 153 for the loss of six wickets in 20 overs
 bharat ne is lakshya ko do wicket khokar 15
 Achieved in 4 overs

 'uske sunahare rang ke bal jo us samay uljhe hue sir ke chaaron taraf bikhare pade the
 It seemed like there was a fire in pink water
 ' (kahani – babul mora)'kapade jaise sharir se chipke ja rahe the
 Shammo handle those clothes and separate them from the body, do not thaw with the sweat
 ' (mere hisse kii dhoop)zakiya zubairi kii kahaniyon kii zamin ajanabi nahin he, vah hamaari or aapaki parkhi hui he
 So when we read their stories, all those characters feel to us like 'shammo' of 'apni ki Dhoop'
 isi tarah kii duusari kahani ‘laut aao tum’ he – jo rishton kii aadhunik samikarnon par buni or bilkul nai kahani he
 It is useless to find any kind of suit in it
 yah dhalati umr ke bich jawan umr dwaara us santulan kii kahani he jo tanha jode kii aapasi berukhi or samvednaa ke shushk hone kii dhalaan par chaahi-anchaahi urja kii tarang paidaa karti he jo kisi ko manzur he or kisi ko kubul nahin he
 Zakia Zuberi has the ability to tell a story and also has a deep tendency towards solving problems of life
 tabhi ‘babul mora’ or ‘maaria’ jaisi kahaniyaan unhone zindagi ke daaman se uthaain, jinamein vyathaa se zyaada ghrinaa, chahat se kahin zyaada ghin, majaburi se zyaada bhatkaav nazar aata he jo vastav main hamaari tarah ke insaanon kaa yatharth he
 i do not want to reduce the taste of readers reading the story by revealing the stories
 magar lisa, martha or maaria ittfaaq se ye teenon charitra naariyon ke hai jo apane jatil anubhavon dwaara ek khaas samaaj ko hamaare saamne laate hai or vikaas, vaibhav, uplabdhiyon or kabhi suraj naa doobane vaale samrajya kaa vah cheharaa pesh karte hai jise sweekaar karnaa kathin lagata he
 Zakia Zuberi's pen has brilliantly translated that truth into the story
 In this series, Zakia Zubairi's story is 'sankal Ki Mana' which is one of the suffering of world class
 apni hi paidaa kii hui peedi kaa apni tarah na hona
 This is the story of every house and every country, which Zakia ji has said in such a way that it is a reminder of any other grief and fear in your life, not just your story
 zakiya zubairi hindustan main paidaa huin
 Married to an Indian settled in Pakistan and settled in a city like London
 unki kahaniyon ko pard kar mahasoos hua ki unke paas ahsaasat kii teen paraten hai or yahi paraten unki kahaniyon ko zamin detii hai
 The first layer was childhood and youth that passed in India, the second journey to Pakistan and the third to middle-aged foreign travel and breathing on foreign soil
 unki anya kahaniyaan ‘bas ek qadam’, ‘kaccha gosht’, ‘sip main band ghutan’, ‘dheeth muskuraahaten’
 These four stories are stories of the Indian environment
 zakiya zubairi lagbhag chand varshon baad ek baar hindustan kaa chakkar lagaati hai
 She goes to big cities and likes to be called Hindustani
 yah bhi bantwaare ke baad kii ek bahut badi vidmbana he ki aaj tak log apana gaanv apana shahar nahin bhul paae hai
 The language of Zakia Zuberi's stories is simple and breathtaking
 jisamen unki moulik abhivyakti or varnan dhyaan khinchate hai
 The story of his story is not rugged
 jahaan kaa maahaul waisi zabaan
 Therefore, the characters of the story do not seem artificial
 unki zabaan bhi ladkadaati hui nahin balki ganga-jamuna ke doaba se sinchi hui he bhale hi unhone urdu hindi kii tarah padhi or likhi na ho, magar ghar ke us maahaul kaa koi kya karegaa jo aapaki parvarish karata he or pako aapaki boli bolnaa sikhaata he
 Why read: i am sure by reading the story collection of Zakia Zuberi, you too will meet those new feelings, smells and characters and will be very happy to read these stories

 world cap main apana khitaab bachaane ke liye team indiaaj se thik ek maheene baad pakistan ke khilaaf cricket ke mahakumbh main apane safar kaa aagaaj karegi
 On February 15, India have to play their first group match against Pakistan
 bharat ke saath pool bi main chah timen hai
 Out of which India has to play its first two matches against Pakistan and South Africa
 in donon tiimon ke khilaaf world cap main bharat ke record ekadam apojit hai
 When Javed Miandad wept
 
 
 pakistan ke khilaaf bharat world cap main kabhi haara nahin he to dakshin africa se kabhi jeet nahin paaya he
 While India would like to maintain this record against Pakistan, registering the first World Cup win against South Africa can prove to be a challenge for Team India
 1975 se lekar 2011 world cap tak team india ne kul 67 match khele hai, jisamen se use 39 main jeet or 26 main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 If a match was tied, one ended without a result
 bharat ke naam par do world cap (1983, 2011) khitaab darj hai, jabaki ek baar team india upavijeta (2003) rahi he
 India and Pakistan have had 6 matches between 1992 and 2011 in the 'pak Safar' Recordworld Cup against Pakistan and India have won in all of them
 1992 main bhale hi pakistan world champion bana ho lekin use bharat ke khilaaf group match main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 In the match played on 4 March, India won by 43 runs

 After this, India won by 29 runs against Pakistan in the semi-final match played in Mohali in 2011
 is match main sachin tendulkar ne 85 ranon kii yaadgaar pari kheli thi
 Sachin Tendulkar has been the man of the match in three of the six World Cup victories against Tendulkarpakistan who have been a 'villain' for Pakistan
 1992 world cap main tendulkar ne 54 ranon kii naabad pari kheli thi or saath hi ek wicket bhi liya tha
 In the 2003 World Cup, wickets were falling at one end and Tendulkar was lying at the other end
 98 ranon kii pari khelkar unhone bharat kii jeet kii neenv rakhi thi
 Everyone remembers the semi-final match played in Mohali
 apane kariyar ke aakhri world cap main tendulkar ne pakistan ke khilaaf 85 ran jade or team ko jeet kii raah dikhaai
 The toss has also been the 'boss' India has won the toss in five of the 6 matches against Pakistan, if except the 2003 World Cup, each time India has won the toss against Pakistan and has decided to bat first
 pehle ballebaaji karte hue team india ne hameshaa aisa lakshya rakhaa, jahaan tak pakistani cricket team pahunch hi na sake
 India could never overcome 'chokers' The first match of the World Cup between India and South Africa was played on 15 March 1992 in Adelaide
 is match main bharat ne toss haara or pehle ballebaaji karte hue mahaj 180 ran banaae

 jawaab main dakshin africa team ne paanch gend shesh rahete hi 6 wicket se jeet darj kii
 Andrew Hudson (53) and Peter Kirsten (84) combined to win the South African team
 iske baad 1999 main bharat ne toss jeeta or pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla kiya
 India scored 253 runs on the innings of Sourav Ganguly (97), Rahul Dravid (54) but South Africa achieved this target easily
 is match main jaik kallis ne 96 ranon kii clasik pari kheli thi
 India may have become World Champion in the 2011 World Cup but could not break the line of defeat in the World Cup against South Africa
 tendulkar (111) kii centuri, or gautam gambhir (69) kii pariyon ke dam par bharat ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karte hue 297 ranon kaa mushkil lakshya diya

 unhone kaha ki isse bainkon kaa enpie badhata he or desh main aarthik vishmata paidaa hoti he
 Kat has warned of starting a big national movement on this issue
 cat ne iske liye 12-13 janvari 2019 ko bhopal main apni rashtriya gavarnig council kii baithak bulaai he, jisamen desh ke sabhi rajyon ke vyapaaree netaa hissaa lenge
 It is worth mentioning that before the elections, Congress had promised loan waiver to farmers in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the first loan waiver was announced for farmers in these three states

 In the Bihar Assembly Elections 2015, Congress won 27 mlas
 congress ke 27 vidhayakonmen kam se kam 18 mlas ke nitish kumaar kii partigediu ke sang janeki khabaren aa rahi thim
 This is the reason that the Congress high command is busy fixing its house before besieging Nitish
 isi maddenjar rahul bihar ke congressi vidhayakon ke sang mulaakaat kar apane vidhayakon ko tuutane se bachaana chaahate hai
 In fact, the Congress supremo had sent Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad, JP Aggarwal and Jyotiraditya Scindia separately in view of the possibility of a breakdown of the Bihar Congress mlas
 in teenon netaaon kii report ke aadhaar par hi congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi bihar ke vidhayakon ke saath baithkar unki shankaaon ko dur karenge

 vah in vidhayakon ke jariye jaananaa chaahate hai, ki kis netaa ke kehane par or kis tarah kaa unhen pralobhan congress se alag hokar jediu ke saath le jane kii koshishen kii ja rahi hai
 Earlier, targeting PM Modi, Congress President Rahul Gandhi questioned why the government promising 'good days' is silent on this
 rahul ne twitor par pradhanmantri modi or bhaajapa ke kuch netaaon ke puraane bayanon se judaa ek video post karte hue kaha, ‘bhaajapa sarkaar ne varsh 2014 se petrol / alpiji / dijal par kar ke jariye 10 lakh rupee kaa sangrah kiya

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii bijepi ke saath asahajata badhati ja rahi he

 pichley do hafton main kam se kam chaar baar nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke bade bhai jaise kathith ravaie par nakhushi jaahir kii he
 On 17 May, Nitish Kumar met a delegation of All Assam Students Union (AASU), which is campaigning against the citizenship bill of the Modi government
 yah bill bijepi ke liye raajnneetik rup se kaaphi sanvadensheel masalaa he
 This bill states that if Hindus of neighboring countries are harassed on the basis of religion, then they should be given citizenship in India
 nitish kumaar ne aasu ke pratinidhimandal ko bharosa diya ki vah piem modi ko patr likhakar is bill ko rokane kii maang karenge
 This means that if the Modi government brings this bill in the Parliament, then the JD (U) can oppose it

 ' vipakshi dalon ne bhi notebandi ke maamle main modi sarkaar par aise hi aarope lagaae the
 Unhappy over flood relief, a day after this, another incident happened to annoy Nitish Kumar
 modi sarkaar ne bihar sarkaar ko baadh raahat ke liye 1,750 karod rupee dene ko kahe the, lekin bihar ko vastav main sirf 1,250 karod rupee hi mili
 Nitish Kumar is not happy with this flood relief package
 vishesh package kii phir uthi maang29 may ko nitish kumaar ne twit kar kaha ki bihar or anypichde rajyonko vishesh darja dene kii maang par vitt ayog ko punarvichaar karnaa chahie
 This is a very old demand of Nitish Kumar
 lekin bijepi ke saath unke sarkaar banane ke baad se hi yah thande baste main padaa hua tha
 Now they have pulled out this buried issue again
 yah masalaa unhone aise samay main baahar nikaala he, jab vipaksh 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye modi virdohi morcha banane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Nitish Kumar, it seems, is trying to make such a convenient change in his position to negotiate with people outside the NDA
 raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par charchaa kaa jawaab dete hue loksabhaa main piem narendra modi ne kaha, ham viraasat main mili puraani samasyaon ke samaadhaan kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi enumerated all the successes of his government and attacked the opposition parties selectively
 unhone kaha ki mudda yah nahin he ki yojanaon kaa naam badal diya gaya he yaa nahin, balki mudda samasya he, jiske samaadhaan kii jarurat he
 PM Modi said that the country makes people, not governments
 sarkarein aati-jaati rahati hai
 The PM said, the issue is the problem, not the name
 swatchta hamaari ek samasya he, swatchta hamaari maansikta se judi he, swatchta abhiyaan udghaatan kaa kaam nahin he
 Without naming the main opposition Congress, the Prime Minister gave a befitting reply, "my political acumen says, never stop MNREGA
" 
 
 main aisi galati kabhi nahin kar saktaa, kyonki manaregaa aapaki vifaltaaon kaa jeeta-jaagta smarak he
 
 
 After 60 years of independence, you had to send people to dig the pit

 modi ne vipaksh se kaha ki bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main kamiyaan dur karne den, ise pratishtha kaa vishay nahin banaaen
 The PM said that no one has the right to discriminate on the basis of religion
 unhone kaha, meri sarkaar kaa ek hi dharm 'sabase pehle bharat', ek hi dharm granth 'bharat kaa samvidhan', ek hi bhakthi 'sava sau karod bharatiyon kaa kalyaan' he
 The UP government has given a written statement in the Supreme Court in which it has apologized to the court over the disclosure of the names of the rape victims of the Muzaffarnagar communal riots

 jabaki ham logon ne 2014 main bade ummiido ke saath bijepi ko vot kiya tha, lekin hamaare dard main sirf choudhary ajit singh hi khadey najar aate hai
 Anees Ahmad of Bijnor, who was involved in Kisan Kranti Yatra, said that the BJP has greatly worsened the condition of farmers
 modi sarkaar ne kaha tha ki kisaanon se jude samanon par jiesti nahin lagegi, iske baavjood tractor kii kharidari par 28 fisadi jiesti lee ja rahi he
 Our sugarcane is not being paid
 aise main hamen is sarkaar ko ab dobaaraa se nahin aane dena he
 The RLD seems to be getting the most political benefit from the peasant movement
 yahi vajah rahi ki choudhary ajit singh ne kisaanon se milane main der nahin kii
 The biggest reason behind this was also that Ajit Singh comes from West UP and most of the Jat community farmers were involved in Tuesday's movement
 yahi donon aadhaar ajit singh kaa he
 In the Kairana by-election, the issue of sugarcane was made by Ajit Singh and his son Jayant Singh, which also gave him political advantage
 yahi vajah he ki loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue areldi ne apane aadhaar ko majboot karne ke liye kisaan muddon ko hawa dena shuru kar diya he
 RLD leaders believe that farmers have made up their mind to vote against BJP
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main areldi mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa banakar chunaav ladegi
 The party has already announced this
 areldi kii siyasat kisaan or jat ke sahare hi jinda rahi he, jab in donon apane haath peeche khinche to ajit singh jiro par simat gaye
 Now he is again trying to revive his politics

 Katju even wrote that this 'so-called' Loknayak is Jai Prakash Narayanaki Jayanti
 jepi kii buddhike bare main apni raay jaahir karte hue unhone likhaa-the Lok nayaktoday is the birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narayan, the so called 'lok Nayak'

 The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is not taking the name of the ongoing controversy
 24 ghante ke bheetar hi alok verma kii sibiai nideshak pad se chuttee ho gai
 On Thursday, the selection committee headed by PM Modi decided to remove Alok Verma
 ab is puure maamle par supreme court ke purv justise markandeya katju ne fasebuk par post likhi he
 He has explained why Justice Sikri removed Alok Verma from the post of CBI Director
 unhone likhaa ki kal maine supreme court ke jaj justise eke sikri ko lekar ek post likhaa tha
 Many people asked me that Alok Verma did not get a chance to present his case before the committee
 iske baad maine justise sikri ko aaj subah phone kiya or poocha ki is par aapako kya kahana he
 i also took permission from him to write what he said on Facebook
 baatcheet main justise sikri ne yah baaten kahin--- sivisi ke saamne jo saboot aae the uske aadhaar par usne alok verma ke upar pehle hi aarope lagaae the
 - CVC gave Alok Verma a chance to present his case
 - sivisi dwaara alok verma ko doshi paae jane ke baad justise sikri kaa maananaa tha ki alok verma ko sibiai ke nideshak jaise mahatvapurn pad par nahin hona chahie tha
 They believed that they should not hold this post until their fault was proved or they were declared innocent
 -kuch logon kaa maananaa tha ki alok verma ko hataaya nahin gaya he
 They were not even suspended
 unka sirf tabadalaa kiya gaya
 He continued to get salary
 -jahaan tak alok verma ko sunwaayee ke liye mauka nahin dene kaa sawaal he to principal he ki bina kisi sunwaayee ke pad se nahin hataaya ja saktaa, lekin nilambit kiya ja saktaa he
 Alok Verma has not even been suspended, he has just been transferred to another post of the same rank
 bataa den ki sellection cameti main piem modi, congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge or justise eke sikri shaamil the
 a 2–1 decision was taken against Alok Verma
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or supreme court ke justise eke sikri sivisi kii sifarish ke anusaar alok verma ko hataane ke haq main the, jabaki mallikarjun khadge ne iskaa virodh kiya
 What was written in the first post Katju Negestis Katju wrote in his first post that Alok Verma has been removed from the post of CBI Director
 iskaa faisla pradhanantri modi kii adhyayakshata vaali 3 sadasyeey cameti ne kiya
 The Prime Minister and Sikri decided to remove Alok Verma
 vahiin mallikarjun khadge ne unke faisle kaa virodh kiya
 After this decision, i got many calls, and people asked what i had to say on this
 main justise sikri ko bahut achche se jaanata hum kyonki main dilli hycourt main unka chif justise tha
 i can appreciate his honesty
 unhone bina kisi saboot ke alok verma ke khilaaf faisla nahin liya hoga
 i do not know what the evidence is, but i know Justice Sikri and from my knowledge i can say that he cannot be influenced by anyone
 unke upar kisi bhi tarah ke aarope lagaana galat he

 com / Py89zgc6y1 — Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) March 13, 2016LEAKED: Akshay Kumar's 'toilet', found in this filmmaker's pen drive, box office report of Akshay Kumar's film Toilet Ek Prem Katha, regardless of the criteria of the critics The film has not done well but due to the fans, the film is doing well in terms of earnings
 film ne opening de par hi 14 karod rupee kii kamai kaa aankada chune vaali he
 Former CM Sheila Dixit's statement on CM Arvind Kejriwal over the quarrel with the officials has created a stir in the Aam Aadmi Party
 'aap' netaaon ne aarope lagaaya he ki 2012 main jab shila dikshit mukhyamantri thim tab dilli naagarik sahakaari bank main ek bade ghotaale ko anjaam diya gaya tha
 At present, the Chief Secretary of the Delhi Government, MM Kutty, is avoiding accountability in the same scam case of Sheila Dixit and this is the reason that former CM Sheila Dixit's affection for these officers is growing
 aam aadmi party ne 10 aarope lagaate hue bataaya he ki aakhir ye bank ghotaalaa tha kya, or kaise isamen sarkari afasar congress ke netaaon or us ghotaale ke doshiyon ko bachaa rahe hai-1
 In 2012, there was a huge mess in the recruitment of 40 people in this cooperative bank and some special people were recruited in a planned manner
 jisamen kanoon or prakriya kii andekhi kii gai
 2
 zaruri prakriya kii andekhi karte hue yojanabaddh tareeke se 62 vishesh logon ko paddonnatti di gai, jisamen bank ke ek diarector ne to apane bete ko hi promoshan de diya
 3
 farzi kaagazon ke aadhaar par karodon rupee ke lone die gaye jo kabhi waapas hi nahin aae
 4
 kuch lone to aise logon ke naam se die gaye jo darz karaae paton par rahete bhi nahin the
 5
 zamin ke nakli kaagazat ke aadhaar par karodon rupee ke lone die gaye or wo lone kaa paisa waapas bhi nahin aayaa
 All this was done in a very planned manner
 6
 To make the board director, a big scandal was done about the membership of the said cooperative bank under which fake members were made
 khud tatkalinmukhyamantri ne1000 membership ke form kharide the or aise hi shila dikshit ji ke kuch khaas logon ne baari sankhya main membership form khariden or farzi member banaae or farji lone bhi paas karaae
 7
 shila dikshit ji kii sarkaar ne jayabhagwan naamak vyakti ko isi bank kaa administrator banaaya or phir baad main farzi members ke sahare shri jayabhagwan ji ko diarector or phir bank kaa chairman bhi banavaa diya
 Under whose supervision, a big scam was carried out in this bank
 gyaat ho ki jayabhagwan ko tatkaaleen mukhyamantri shila dikshit kaa aashirwad praapt tha
 8
 jab aam aadmi party kii sarkaar satta main ai to is maamle kii jaanch ko or tej karaayaa gaya
 Earlier some registrars had investigated the matter but never submitted a report
 ab vidhansabha cameti is maamle main afasaron se jawaab-talab kar rahi thi lekin afasar is ghotaale par koi jawaab nahin de rahe hai
 9
 vidhansabha cameti ne purv register shoorveer singh se is ghotaale ko lekar jawaab maanga to unhone cameti dwaara puche gaye kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab nahin diya
 When the Chief Secretary was asked for a reply regarding the inaction of Shurveer Singh and Chief Secretary MM Kutty was asked to take action on Shurveer Singh, now MM Kutty is also not giving any reply to the Committee of the Assembly on this bank-scam

 Now this is the reason for Sheela ji's affection towards the officers
 dilli pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki 'vidhansabha kii cameti ne is bank ghotaale ke maamle main mukhya sachiv se jawaab-talab kiya tha or unke maatahat kaam karne vaale afasar ke kilaaf ection lene kaa aadesh diya tha, mukhya sachiv mem kutti naa keval is maamle main koi jawaab de rahe hai balki cameti kii taraf se jo nirdesh mukhya sachiv ko die gaye the us sandarbh main kii gai karrwai ke bare main koi jaankaree vidhansabha kii cameti ko nahin de rahe hai
 According to Saurabh Bhardwaj, former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit is now showing affection towards Chief Secretary MM Kutty and other officers, the reason for this is that Kutty Saheb has been the Principal Secretary to Sheila Ji in the past and the whole bank-scam under Sheila Ji's nose Was carried out
 jisaki javabdehi se ab ye afasar bhaag rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party says that the current Chief Secretary was formerly the Principal Secretary to Sheila Dixit and that is why today Sheila Dixit is defending the officer

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi is going to contest from Amethi in UP and Wayanad in Kerala
 amethi main rahul gandhi kii takkar sidhe taur par bhaajapa kii kendriya mantri smriti irani se hogi
 At the same time, the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) in Wayanad faces the Left Democratic Front (LDF)
 dakshin bharat main ldf anya dalon ko kadi chunauti detii he
 The Congress did not want to weaken its hold in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, so it has fielded Rahul Gandhi from the Wayanad seat
 congress ne rahul kii seat ko lekar sef game khelaa he
 If the Amethi seat goes by hand, the Wayanad seat will act as a lifeboat for Rahul

 At the same time, the Congress delayed it

 Ending internal discord of the party According to Congress sources, Rahul Gandhi's standing from Wayanad seat was to end the infighting within the party

 It could not be decided which candidate from Wayanad seat

 Claim- North and South India will have a good relationship Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka join the three states from Wayanad seat

 This will create a good relationship between North and South India

 After losing to Rahul in 2014, Rahul is targeting Rahul Gandhi for the shortcomings present in the area
 vahiin, kerala main vartmaan vampanthi sarkaar ne loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar majboot taiyaari kar rakhi he
 Given this, the Congress decided to contest Rahul from two seats
 Kerala CM p Vijayan on Rahul Gandhi contesting from Wayanad: He's fighting in one of the 20 constituencies(in Kerala)&doesn't need to be seen as any different
 We'll fight him
 He should've contested from a constituency where BJP is contesting,it's nothing but a fight against Leftpic

 For the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the Bharatiya Janata Party has released the 10th list of candidates, announcing the names of 29 candidates from Uttar Pradesh and 10 from West Bengal
 upi kii list main kai bade badlaav bhi dekhne ko mili hai
 The seats of Union Minister Maneka Gandhi and her son Varun Gandhi have been interchanged, while Satyadev Singh Pachauri has been given a chance by cutting the ticket of senior party leader Murli Manohar Joshi from Kanpur seat
 inke alaava itawa seat se ashok dhohare kaa tikat katkar ramashankar katheria ko tikat diya gaya he
 Ramashankar Katheria is currently an MP from Agra, but has been shifted to Etawah
 jabaki bhadohi se vartmaan saansad virendra singh mast kii seat bhi badal di gai he, or unhen ab baliya se tikat diya gaya he
 That is, Ballia MP Bharat Singh's ticket has been cut
 barabanki se maujuuda priyanka ravat kaa tikat kaat diya gaya he, unki jagah maujuuda vidhayak upendra ravat ko tikat diya gaya he
 The current MP from Allahabad, Shyam Charan Gupta has left the BJP and joined the Samajwadi Party
 jiske chalate elahabaad loksabhaa seat se upi sarkaar main mantri reeta bahuguna joshi ko tikat diya gaya he
 Similarly, Bahraich MP Savitribai Phule has left BJP and joined Congress, due to which BJP has given opportunity to Akshaywarlal Gaur from this seat
 akshayavarlaal philhal vidhayak hai
 BJP has cut the ticket of its sitting MP Nepal Singh from Rampur, the stronghold of Jaya Pradasamajwadi Party Azam Khan from Rampur
 unki jagah bollywood abhinetri or purv sapa saansad jaya pradaa ko pratyaashee banaaya gaya he
 Jaya Prada has recently joined BJP

 BJP has not given ticket to its senior leader Murli Manohar Joshi from Kanpur
 unki jagah upi sarkaar ke mantri satyadev singh pachori ko tikat diya gaya he
 The ticket of sitting MP Rajesh Pandey has also been cut from Kushinagar seat, Vijay Dubey, considered close to Yogi Adityanath, has been given a chance
 vijay dube 2009 main bhi is seat bijepi ke tikat par chunaav lade the, lekin haar gaye the
 He then won the 2012 assembly election on a Congress ticket, but was expelled by the Congress due to cross voting in the election of Rajya Sabha MP and he returned to BJP
 ab unhen kushinagar loksabhaa seat se mauka diya gaya he
 That is, the BJP has made a lot of changes in this list of 29 UP candidates
 kuch puraane saansadon par bharosa jataayaa gaya he, to kahin badlaav kar kshetreey virodh ko kam karne kii koshish kii gai he
 The cloud of suspicion over Varun Gandhi has also been dispelled and the party has finally given him a ticket, though there is an attempt to change his seat to give a bigger message
 afghanistan or dakshin asia ke liye raashtrapati donald trump kii kshetreey niti ne is kshetra ke samrik or nitigat halkon main halchal paidaa kar di he
 Initially it was theoretically focused on Afghanistan, but subsequent statements by US officials make it clear that it is important for former President Barack Obama to address Asia's growing influence in the region and the challenges that arise

 The comments against China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) were probably intended to please Delhi, or else it is incomprehensible to call an economic partnership "predatory economics"

 Actually, America itself can come forward to see and understand BRI for its own benefit
 aakhir main sach to yah he ki aarthik vastaviktaaen hi nateezon ko tay karne kaa kaam karengi
 The Chinese have a unique understanding of history and have expertise in maintaining strategic patience
 unhone pehle hi samaj liya he ki paraspar-nirbharta ke is yug main bhu-arthshaastra hi kargar sabit hoga, na ki bhu-raajnneeti
 President Trump's view of the policy of America First, ie, First America's interest, is the opposite
 afghanistan ke liye america kii ranneeti bhi lagbhag aisi hi he—lado or baat karo

 afghanistan main lagaataar paise jhonknaa or anishchit kaal ke liye vahaan bane rahanaa un logon ke liye ek ummid he jo vahaan america kii maujuudagi se phayda uthaa rahe hai
 The way America is constantly ready to bear the burden of Afghanistan, there is no discomfort to neighboring countries
 jahaan tak pakistan kii baat he, uske liye afghanistan main sthayitv ek praathamikta he
 In such a situation, it cannot be denied that American intervention is very important for sustainability

 Eliminating violence and terrorism in Afghanistan, reviving national unity and establishing peace is very important for Pakistan's own security and prosperity

 On May 21, 2013, India Today published a special report titled 'six AIIMS before collapsing' on the plight of the six new AIIMS being built in the country
 report ko gambhirtha se lete hue swasthya or parivaar kalyaan par sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne kendriya swasthya or parivaar kalyaan mantralay se binduvaar jawaab talab kiya
 The Ministry has tried to deny many of the facts of the report in its round-the-clock reply, but it is believed that the students who have joined these new AIIMS came here expecting the facilities like Delhi AIIMS
 samiti ne mantralay se poocha tha, ''india today kii report ke mutabik chah nae ames main dilli ke ames kii tulana main na to shikshak hai or na stareey suvidhaayen
 "in response, the Ministry of Health said," It is true that in 2012 MBBS students will have enrolled in these AIIMS in the hope of facilities like Delhi AIIMS
 lekin nae ames kii tulana dilli ames se nahin kii jaani chahie
 In this reply, the ministry tried to save itself by claiming India Today's report as baseless
 india today apni report par kaayam he ki dwitiya varsh ke chaatro ke liye kaayade kaa aspataal in ames ke paas nahin he
 The ministry did not reject a single letter from AIIMS directors published by India Today
 in patron ko khaarij kiye bina swasthya mantralay kii report par ungali uthaanaa samajh se pare he

 darasal is mahila ke pati ko porn dekhne kii is kadar lat he ki unki shaadishuda jindagi par bhi asar pad rahaa he
 Troubled by the addiction of her husband of 55 years, the woman petitioned the Supreme Court and demanded a ban on porn sites
 mahila ne apni yachika main daleel di he ki agar is umr main unke padhe-likhe pati porn ke aage majaboor hai to naujavaanon kii sthiti isse bhi zyada bighad sakati he
 What did the petition say? The woman wrote in her petition to the Supreme Court - My husband got addicted to porn very late and these days he spends more time watching porn which is easily available on the internet
 porn kii vajah se mere pati kaa dimag dooshit ho gaya he or hamaari shaadishuda jindagi kharaab ho gai he
 The relationship deteriorated due to porn
 The woman said that her married life was going well for 30 years, but since her husband started watching porn, it affected her personal life
 mahila ne bataaya ki vah or unke bachche pati kii is lat kii vajah se pareshni jhel rahe hai
 The woman who filed the petition is a social worker
 unhone bataaya ki apane kaam ke dauraan bhi unhen aise log mili jinaki nijee jindagi par porn kii vajah se bura asar padaa
 Because there is a plethora of porn on the internet and it is easily accessible

 sukhyat lekhika tasalima nasrin kaa nayaa upanyaas 'besaram' aayaa he
 In this novel, the social conditions created due to deportation and the socio-economic condition of the people struggling under those circumstances are etched on the canvas of the story
 'besaram' upanyaas tasalima nasrin ke 'lajja' upanyaas kii uttar katha he
 It has been published by Rajkamal Prakashan
 upanyaas kaa bangla bhashaa se hindi main anuwaad utpal bannerjee ne kiya he
 While in the novel 'lajja', the atrocities on minority Hindus due to communal riots in Bangladesh and the exodus of Hindus from there were made the basis of the story, this novel Begani Suranjan, who started a new campaign to live by breathing air , The story of Kiranmayi and Maya
 'besaram' upanyaas ke sabhi paatr nishchit rup se un chehron kii akkashi karte hai jinhen sampradayik unmaad or atyaachaar ke kaaran apana mulq chhodkar gaiyr-mulq main jivan-basar karne ke liye sangharsh karnaa padaa he
 Due to the novel 'lajja', a fatwa was issued by radical groups in Bangladesh on writer Taslima Nasreen and the book was banned
 lekhika ne khud nirvaasan jaisi paristhitiyon kaa saamana kiya he or aaj bhi nirvasit jivan vyateet kar raheen hai
 The novel begins with the writer accidentally meeting Suranjan, a character in Lajja in Kolkata
 yah vahiin suranjan he jisko kendra main rakhkar lajja upanyaas likhaa gaya tha
 The writer is oblivious to the fact that Suranjan and his family survived the 1993 communal riots in Bangladesh and have migrated from Bangladesh and settled in India
 is mulaaqaat main lekhika ko pataa chalata he ki suranjan ke pita sudhamay kaa dehanth ho chukaa he tathaa uski bahan or maa kiranmayi jinda hai
 At the end of the novel, the writer meets Zulekha and ends the conversation with her
 darasal samoochaa upanyaas ek aise kathanak main guntha he ki uske bhav bina uske kuch anshon ko padhe bina spasht nahin hote
 Some examples: When i asked about Maya, Kiranmayi cried
 ve roti-roti boleen ki uski baat mat pucho maa, uskaa dimag thik nahin he
 His mind has gone bad
 ab usase kya milogi? use dekhakar tumhen acha nahin lagegaa
 i exhaled with a long breath and said - what am i feeling after seeing this condition of you people? My mind is saying that Maya is not good, that is why i want to see Maya
 kiranmayi bolti raheen- main use samajhaaoongi
 i will definitely meet you once
 uski koi saheli vagairah bhi nahin he
 She is not leading a natural life
 bangladesh ke ladakon ne us par jis tarah se atyaachaar kiye the, uske to jinda rahane kii baat hi nahin thi
 Don't know, how will all these things come out of his mind! Even today, all those things are like a nightmare for him
 usne zebrdasti kaamana kii thi ki vah ek normal life jiegi
 Only by wishing can you get everything! Yes, but the worst is that she is still able to do the job
 mujhe dar lagata he, kabhi yah naukari chhot gai to? suna he ki vah daftar main bhi cheekhti-chillaati he
 She does this as soon as the incident of Bangladesh arrives
 us desh kaa koi dikh jaae to vah us vyakti par vishwaas nahin karti
 He is angry with the entire country
 maine use bahut samajhaayaa, usase kaha ki kuch achche log bhi to the us desh main
 Maya is not ready to accept this under any circumstances
 main chupchaap sunati rahi
 She tried to understand the reason for Maya's anger
 maaya ke liye mere man main pehle se kahin zyaada karunaa upajane lagi
 - Massiman, i want to meet her despite all this
 mere swar main aaveg tha
 But i understood that both my impulse and Maya's impulse were different
 kiranmayi kah nahin rahi thim, lekin mujhe achche se samaj main aa rahaa tha ki maaya mujhase bhayankar naaraaz he
 'in shame, i wrote the thing that kidnapped him, probably that's why
 mujhe to yah jaankaree thi ki un logon ne maaya kii hatya kar di he
 But Maya is ultimately alive
 jinda he shaayad isiilie use marane kii takalif jhelni padi
 If she had died, she would have survived
 ladakiyon ko to mare bina mukti nahin milti
 My eyes got wet with tears for Maya
 ***main apane kaamon main vyast rahi
 There was some resentment over Suranjan
 usne phone karne ko kahkar bhi nahin kiya tha
 He s
 em
 s
 kaa jawaab bhi nahin diya tha
 i gave him such a nice kurta as a gift, he did not even say thank you and now after fifteen days, he is calling and saying that he has to meet me
 aah, ghar kii kheti he! sochaa tha, kah duungi ki main vyast hum, mulaakaat nahin ho sakati
 Call back later lekin nahin, main aisa kah nahin pai
 Actually the thing is that i cannot tolerate artificiality
 meri jo ichha hoti he, vahi karti hum
 For the number of days there is resentment, i keep pulling the impulse of the impulse
 lekin meri naaraazgi bhi kitne din tik paati he bhala!suranjan ne jo aane kii ichha prakat kii thi, mujhe laga ki chaar sari or kurte kaa jo packet main unhen de ai thi, shaayad vah lautaane aayega
 i was ready to take her back
 maine soch liya tha ki unhen apane doston main baant duungi
 Apart from this, what else could have been done! But when Suranjan came, he did not have a packet in his hand
 uske haath main tiffin karier tha
 What's in it? Food items
 kiranmayi ne aaj hi apane haathon se tamaam chizein banaakar bheji thim
 Now what has all this sent? What was the need of sending food items? My fridge is full of food items
 main unhen khaakar khatm nahin kar paati, chizein phenkani padati hai
 More food on this? Oops! Mumbling it all, i took it to the kitchen and opened the tiffin carrier and told Minati - empty it and wash it and give it back
 yah kahkar main dekhne lagi ki unhone kya pakaaya he to mujhe dikhaai di panchaphodan vaali masoor kii daal, machhlee kaa sir daalkar bani hui arabi ke tane kii sabzi, mudighanto, late machhlee kii shutaki, kaddu ke pattey main lapetakar tali hui machhlee
 i stared at those tiffin coaches for a long time
 ankhen aansuon se bhar uthin
 Eyes flowed in tears
 tiffin karier ke dibbe ke upar ek choti-si parchi fansaakar rakhi hui thi
 i read it
 maa tasalima, meraa pyaar sweekaar karnaa
 Must eat the things sent
 maine tumhaare liye apane haathon se banaakar kuch maamuli-si chizein bheji hai
 Who will feed you here by making these things! Thinking about you, i cry in private
 tum saavdhaan rahanaa maa! hausala rakhana
 i was holding that paper
 likhe hue par tap-tap karte aansu girane lage or vah likhaawat dhundhlee hoti gai
 At the same time it was not possible for me to go in front of Suranjan in the drawingroom
 mujhe aansu ponchney ke liye vahaan thodi der or ruknaa padaa, or thodi der gale ke swar ko sukhaane ke liye bhi
 xxrep 4 * The Maya i knew, Zulekha told that Maya has also changed completely
 lekin agar main yah sochuun ki maaya ne dhaka ke un muslim sampradayik dushkarmiyon ko maaf kar diya he, to vah meri bhul hogi
 He is against every rapist, whatever religion he belongs to
 vah striyon se vidwesh karanevaale harek ke kilaaf he, phir vah jis bhi dharm kaa ho
 But, Zulekha laughingly said that Maya also says that all men are the same, whatever religion they belong to
 -usamen itani jaldi yah realizeshan aayaa kaise? shaadi karne ke liye abhi kuch dinon pehle tak to vah pagal thi!julekha boli- jo log zyaada pagal hote hai, unhen hi sabase pehle hosh aata he
 - Is that so? - It is so
 -mujhe aisa nahin lagata
 The fanatical people do not easily become aware
 kisi chiz ko lekar andhaa hone kaa matlab hi he ki use puraa nahin dikhaai de rahaa
 This book by Taslima Nasreen raises the voice against the shamelessness of the fundamentalist and orthodox system and explores the possibilities of equality options at every level
 yah koi raajnneetik kahani nahin balki ek saamaajik kahani he, jo logon ke jindagi, parivaar or unke bich panape sambandhon ke bare main he
 The four characters Suranjan, Kiranmayi, Maya and Zulekha and the writer's dialogue with those characters keeps this novel moving
 tasalima nasrin ke lekhan kii khaasiyat yah he ki kathanak kisi filmi drishy kii tarah aapke aage se guzarate hai or aap swayan ko us parivesh or paatr ke jivan se ghulmil jate hai

 rashtriya shiksha niti kaa masauda taiyaar karne ke liye banaai gai samiti ke adhyaksh kasturirangan ne kaha he ki hindi kisi bhi rajya par thopi nahin jaaegi
 He has stated that the purpose of the report is to make students multilingual
 yah unki ichha par nirbhar hogi ki ve kya padhanaa chaahate hai
 Kasturirangan said that the committee has prepared a three-language formula based on the experience so far, medium of instruction in schools, local needs, how much the language is spoken and availability of teachers
 pehle kii niti main bhi teen bhashaa kaa formula shaamil tha, isliye ab isamen koi bada badlaav kii jarurat nahin he
 He said that we will not impose language on any state, states and schools should decide what to implement
 gauratlab he ki modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal main kendriya maanav sansaadan vikaas mantri rahe prakaash jaavdekar ne nai shiksha niti kaa masauda taiyaar karne ke liye ek samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 It is headed by Kasturirangan
 samiti ne haal hi main report jari kii he
 It has been suggested to implement the formula of three languages, under which it has been said to teach 3 languages up to class 8
 jisamen angreji, kshetreey bhashaa or angreji ko anivaary rup se padhaaye jane kii sifarish kii gai he
 What is the draft education policy? Motikasturirangan said that the report emphasized on making students multilingual
 jo bhartiya shiksha paddati kii visheshta he
 Our aim is that children should have knowledge of three and more languages at primary school level so that they can learn more languages if they want to go ahead
 lekin report ke baad iskaa galat tareeke se vyakhya kiya gaya
 Due to which it seemed that Hindi was being imposed
 angreji ko kam karke aankna makasad nahiiconomix times ke mutabik unhone kaha ki hamaari report kaa makasad angreji ko nicha dikhaanaa nahin he
 We know that English is an important medium of dialogue
 isliye hamane angreji ko bhi mahatv diya he
 There are two reasons for this
 pehla ki vigyaan ke alaava yah anya vyavsaayik paathyakramon ke liye shiksha kaa madhyam he
 Second, English is prevalent worldwide as an international language
 matlab ki hamen duniya se judana he to angreji kaa gyaan jaruri he
 Also, we have emphasized on Indian languages
 yah isliye jaruri he ki agar koi chaatr angreji bhashaa main science padhata he to us par amal karne yaa nae idia par apni bhashaa main kaam karnaa aasaan hota he
 Internationalizing education now India's economy is global
 aise main hamaara paathyakram bhi aisa hona chahie ki ham videshi chaatro ko bhi apane yahaan padhaa saken
 This has also been taken into consideration in our report
 isamen kai aise suzav shaamil hai jo bhartiya shiksha paddati ko majbootee pradaan karegi or antarrashtriya str par nai pahchaan degi
 Our civilization and culture have been proud
 pracheen samay main bhi hamaare yahaan nalanda or takshashila main videshi chaatr gyaan praapt karne aate the
 Our schooling is 15 years old
 hamane aisi shiksha paddati banane kaa suzav diya he ki aage chalakar yah kaaphi majboot bane or hamaare chaatr pratidwandvita ke vaataavaran main nikhar kar saamne aaen or har tarah se compitishan kaa muqabla kar saken

 With the face of Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha elections, the NDA made a clean sweep in many states but in Punjab, the NDA faced defeat
 duusare rajyon main sahyogi jahaan jeet se gadgad hai vahiin punjab main bijepi kii sahyogi akali dal ne haar par sawaal khadey kar die hai
 In Punjab, the bjp-shiromani Akali Dal entered the electoral fray
 iske baavjood soobe main congress ke vijay rath ko nahin roak sake hai
 In such a situation, the Akali Dal's core committee met on Tuesday to churn out the defeat
 is baithak main savarna aarakshan kii vajah se dalit matadaataaon ke chhitakane ko haar kaa kaaran bataaya gaya
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Akali Dal National Spokesperson Mahesh Inder Grewal said that due to the defeat of our party in Punjab, the Dalit voter was away from the party
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar ne savarna samudaay ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan diya tha
 In such a situation, among the Dalit community in Punjab, these opposing parties told that if the Modi government returned to power, then the reservation system would end
 unhen bataaya gaya ki savarna aarakshan to abhi ek trailor he, aage inkaa makasad aarakshan ko hi puri tarah se samaapt karne kii ranneeti he
 Due to this fear, the Dalit community instead of voting for the Akali Dal went with other parties including BSP
 bataa den ki desh main sabase zyada dalit samudaay ke log punjab main he
 There are about 32 per cent Dalit voters here, who play an important role in victory and defeat
 mahesh inder greval ne kaha ki aarakshan virdohi bayaanbaji ne is chunaav main hamen bahut nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 In Punjab, the Akali Dal contested 10 seats, out of which only 2 seats could be won
 jabaki bijepi teen seat par chunaav ladi thi or do jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 At the same time, Congress has won 8 seats
 mahesh inder greval kehete hai ki ham jalandhar or anantpur sahib seat isliye haar gaye ki in donon siton par dalit vot akali dal ke bajaay basapa ke saath chalaa gaya
 Whereas before this, the Dalit community has been giving us votes
 inder greval kehete hai ki punjab kaa raajnneetik najariya desh ke duusare rajyon se alag he
 Despite Manmohan Singh's government at the center, the Congress could not win here

 The results of Aaj Tak India Today Karvy Insight Survey have left no question or answer to them

 This is the new chapter in the history of popularity of India

 Aaj Tak and India Today - This survey by Karvy Insight is the new departure point of Indian politics from where the power and opposition have to decide their roles
 19 rajya, 97 sansadeey kshetra, 194 vidhansabha kshetra or 12178 logon par hue survey ne kaagaj par likhakar bataaya he ki kehane ko kuch bhi kaha jaae lekin narendra modi abhi nishtakantak raaj bhogenge
 In today's situation, he is unstoppable, immobile and ignorant
 ajtak karvi insite ke survey ke mutabik narend modi ke saamne koi nahin, kahin nahin or kisi hisse main nahin, wo raajnneeti ke ek aise maidan ke yoddha hai jisamen mukaable main utarane vaali sena kaa jom aage badhane se pehle jawaab de gaya he
 33 per cent of the people of India have said that Narendra Modi is the most popular Prime Minister in history
 is survey main nikalakar aayaa he ki dur-dur tak modi kaa koi muqabla nahin, na to vipaksh or na hi bijepi ke bheetar se unhen koi chunauti dene vaala he
 The results of Karvy Insight Survey show that Narendra Modi's leadership has been demolishing the remaining ground of opposition
 wo aise netaa hai ban chuke hai jiske saamne na to koi virodh khadaa he or na hi koi chunauti
 Not even big leaders of BJP are worthy of challenging Modi
 survey ke mutabik janata ne jinamein thodi-bahut sambhaavna dekhi bhi he wo shunya se kuch hi zyada he, jaise modi ko chunauti dene waalon main sabase aage hanyogi adityanath
 But only 13 percent of the people consider Adityanath to be worth it, Shivraj Chauhan considers 5 percent, Amit Shah four percent, Venkaiah Naidu 3 percent, Mohan Bhagwat 3 percent and Devendra Fadnavis only 2 percent
 karvi insite survey main jo sabase haroonges baat nikalakar ai he wo ye ki is desh main bahut badi taadaad aise logon kii he jo modi ke jaadu ke saamne kuch sochane samajhane kii haalat main hi nahin hai, unhen nahin pataa ki agar modi nahin to koun
 In this era of optionlessness, people's imaginations have been answered

 In the survey of Aaj Tak Karvy, 24 percent people said that they do not know who else is Modi? Such desolation was never seen in terms of options
 vitt mantri chidambaram ne antarim bajet ko apni or upie kii tathakthith uplabdhiyon ke bakhaan ke liye bahut acchhee tarah istemaal kiya, bhale hi yah baat aalochakon ke gale se nahin utari hogi
 Till now, the interim budget speech was for very short and limited purposes but Chidambaram gave an economic-social speech bypassing the traditions through which he tried to create a better fabric for his party, the opposition He also attacked Karara
 iske liye unhone aankadon kaa khub sahaara liya or unke saath khub khele bhi
 He also showed dreams of a pink future so that he could do better in elections in times to come
 unhone jidipi vikaas dar ke bare main aise sambhavit aankade pesh kiye jo vartmaan halaat main shaayad hi puure ho saken
 This budget speech, from the beginning to the end, was filled with a description of the achievements which are actually paper and they have no real truth
 unhone to manhagaai ke kam hone ke liye apni peeth thapthapa lee jabaki sara desh jaanata he ki is morche par upie sarkaar buree tarah asafal rahi or aam janata ne abhootpurv mahangaai jheli
 Through this, the Finance Minister tried to please people of every section of the society a little
 masalan unhone chaatro ke liye ajukeshan lone main byaaj kii chhot dene kii baat kahi, unhone sainikon ko khush karne kii ek rank-ek pension kaa bhi praavdhaan kiya, kisaanon ke karj main chhot jari rakhane kii baat kahi, mahilaon kii suraksha kii baat kii, das lakh logon ko rojgaar dene kii baat kii, anusuchit varg ke liye or dhan ke praavdhaan kii baat kahi or khaadya suraksha kii bhi charchaa kii
 He bridged the achievements of his government and made claims that are difficult to believe in today's situation
 itnaa hi nahin unhone desh kii kharaab aarthik sthiti par pardaa daalane ke liye yah bhi kaha ki duusare deshon kii tulana main bharat ke halaat behatar hai
 Only a politician can make such a statement, not an economist
 unka yah kahana ki vikaas ke maamle main upie kaa jawaab nahin, is baat ko ingit karata he ki is avasar kaa unhone raajnneetik phaayde ke liye istemaal kiya lekin yah bhi tay he ki aisa kuch hone vaala nahin he
 The truth is that he completely ignored the sufferings of the public and sang the songs of his and the party's so-called achievements
 unhone bajet bhaashan ke naam par vot kii raajnneeti karne kii puri koshish kii
 This was a budget speech of Chidambaram that will rarely be remembered and even if done, it was because of the lies of the figures

 According to the data, till this time, 48 per cent people believed that the level of corruption has increased from the level before the tenure of the Modi government, while 28 per cent people had any difference in the level of corruption prevailing in the tenure of the Modi government and the previous Manmohan government
 Did not appear vahiin is dauraan 23 fisadi log maanate the ki modi sarkaar ne bhrashtachar par lagaam lagane kii disha main acha kaam kiya he or bhrashtachar ke str ko kam kar diya he
 At the same time, 78 percent of the people surveyed by the organization in January 2018 believed that the Modi government has failed in the direction of curbing corruption
 inamen 44 fisadi log maanate the ki bhrashtachar ke str main ijapha hua he vahiin 34 fisadi logon ko lagata tha ki bhrashtachar kaa str purv kii upie sarkaar jaisaa hi tha

 According to the National Earthquake Center, Kathmandu, a 4-magnitude tremor was felt at 1

 However, on Friday, Minister of Culture, Tourism and Municipal Aviation, Kripshur Sherpa said that only 15 percent of the country's tourist places have been affected by the earthquake
 unhone sarkaar or logon se milakar kaam karne ko kaha he taakiadharabhoot sanrachanaon kaa jald punanirmaankia ja sake
 According to My Republica, he said, 'we have also elected 19 ambassadors from Nepal and abroad for effective promotion of tourism products and services in the international market
 ’- input bhashaa Senior Congress leader and Finance Minister p Chidambaram said today that if the Prime Minister and the party president are the same person, then it should be very good
 unhone enditivi se ek khaas baatcheet main kaha, 'saamaanya rup se
 
 party netaa or pradhanmantri ek hi vyakti ko hona chahie
 
 
 It will depend on the time in which we are living
 aaj, main mahasoos karata he ki kaaphi acha ho agar party pramukh or pradhanmantri ek hi vyakti hon
 ' chidambaram pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke purv media salaahkaar sanyaj baru ke daawey par pratikriya vyakt kar rahe the
 Baru had said that Congress president Sonia Gandhi had the real power in a UPA government
 unhone haalanki baru ke un daavon ko khaarij kar diya ki mahatvapurn filon ko sonia gandhi dekhati thim
 Baru in his book 'the Accidental Prime Minister' has said that the Prime Minister's Principal Secretary Pulak Chatterjee used to take instructions from Sonia Gandhi on important files
 chidambaram ne kaha ki aazaadee ke baad pehle kuch saalon main party adhyaksh or pradhanmantri alag-alag vyakti the, lekin us samay pradhanmantri kaa vyaktitv party adhyaksh se apekshaakrit kaaphi bada tha
 In response to questions about bjp's portrayal of Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi as a strong leader, Chidambaram said that the country does not need a strong leader like Hitler or Mussolini
 unhone kaha, 'maine logon se suna he ki ve aisa netaa chaahate hai jo logon ke sabhi tabakon ko sweekaarya ho, jo budhimaan or dayaalu hon
 i do not think people want a strong leader
 main nahin samajhataa ki log is desh main hitler yaa musolini chaahate hai
 ' yah puche jane par ki kya vah modi kaa zikr hitler yaa musolini ke rup main kar rahe hai, chidambaram ne kaha, 'main kisi kaa zikr hitler yaa musolini ke rup main nahin kar rahaa hum
 i am saying that there are some people who imagine that they can be strong and decisive leaders and the language they use and the gesture they display evoke the image of fascism
 ' On the controversy related to Robert Vadra, Chidambaram said, "he is a private person and until someone files a formal complaint
" 
 The government does not voluntarily ask that a private citizen be investigated
 ' unhone kaha, 'kisi ko pehle jaanch agency yaa kar praadhikaar se aupchaarik shikaayat darj karaani chahie or ve isamen gaur karenge
 No one has filed a formal complaint till now, so why should the government investigate any private person? The BJP has accused the Rajasthan and Haryana governments of giving benefits to Robert Vadra
 unhone kaha ki modi ke kareebi maane jane vaale udyogpati gautam adani ke maamle kii tulana wadra se nahin kii ja sakati
 The Adani issue is a case of state involvement in collateral capitalism
 yah puche jane par ki kya priyanka gandhi ko raajnneeti main badi bhoomika nibhaani chahie, chidambaram ne kaha ki yah faisla unako karnaa he or party un par dabaav nahin bana sakati
 This Diwali saw a collision of three films at the box office
 akshay kumaar kii film housephul 4, taapasi pannu or bhoomi pednekar kii sand kii aankh or rajkumaar raav kii film maid in china kaa is is shuukravaar yani 25 oktober ko relies hui hai
 Nearly 10 years later, we all got to see the Diwali clash of three films
 jahaan ek taraf taapasi or rajkumaar raav kii filmon kii tarif ho rahi he to vahiin akshay kumaar kii film ke charche sabase zyada hai
 Housefull 4 did so much collection? Everyone was eagerly waiting for Housefull 4, the fourth film of the Housefull franchise and now that the film has been released, it has got mixed reactions from the public and critics
 ab akshay kumaar kii multi starer film ke pehle din kaa box offis collection bhi aa chukaa he
 It is believed that Housefull 4 has opened almost Rs 20 crore at the box office on the first day
 is film ke liye shuukravaar ke din dhanteras kaa hona phydemand rahaa he
 Let me tell you that in this multi-starrer film, Akshay Kumarki has Ritesh Deshmukh, Bobby Deol, Kriti Sanon, Kriti Kharbanda, Pooja Hegde, Chunky Pandey and Johnny Lever
 ye film purnjanm par aadhaarit he
 The story of the film dates from 1419 to 2019
 isamen akshay or baaki sabhi actors ko raja-maharaja ke luk or modern avatar main dikhaaya gaya he
 Akshay Kumar and the entire Starcast have done their utmost to promote the film Housefull 4
 alag-alag reality shoj par jane ek baad saath-saath akshay apane sabhi ko-stars ke saath mumbai se special train lekar dilli aae the
 Critics did not like Akshay Kumar's Housefull 4 but the fans are giving full love to this film
 soshal media ke is yug main kab kya trend karne lage, pataa hi nahin chalata, or kabhi-kabhi to kuch aisa bhi trend karne lagata he, jiske bare main aakhir tak sahi jaankaree nahin mil paati
 
 
 Something similar happened on Tuesday, when # missyousattu suddenly appeared on a list of top trends on Twitter, and upon seeing it, it was found that there have been hundreds of tweets with this hashtag, but no one is aware that Sattu What the hell is there
 
 
 micro-bloging website twitor par # missyousattu ke saath post karne vaale bahut-se log isi sawaal kaa jawaab dhund rahe hai ki sattu he koun, lekin bahut-se twit is tarah kiye gaye hai, jaise twit karne vaala sattu ko behad kareeb se jaanata he
 
 
 Yes, by going to Twitter, the easiest guess is that Sattu is a dog who has died recently (but we don't even know the reality)
 
 
 use shradhanjali dene vaale post bhi dheron hai, or uske 'karnaamon' ko yaad kar aansu bahaane waalon kii taadaad bhi acchhee-khaasi he
 
 
 The comments is hashtag ko lekar twitor par maujuud logon ke josh kaa yah alam he ki unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi nahin bakhsha, or unke twitor account kii farzi tasviir banaakar bhi sattu ko shradhanjali dilava daali
 
 
 Well come on, you also see, what is going on on Twitter about this 'unknown' sattu

 lekin jis tarah sarkaar puraani niti ko hi lagu karti ja rahi he, use lekar uski chaddha group par meharbaani saaf jhalak rahi he
 The liquor policy was earlier fixed for one year but when the Assembly elections were held and the Maya government did not show favor in its favor, it approved the liquor policy for two years instead of one

 The Akhilesh government had accepted the policy of Maya government and allowed the old policy to remain in effect for a year
 ab nai niti main bhi vahi dharra apanaate hue, ise do saal ke liye lagu kar diya
 The way the government has increased duty, license fees and revenue, the margin of profit received by retail shoppers has not been increased

 On Sunday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh invited Nawaz Sharif to come to India, and on Monday there were reports of a rift in the main opposition party on this issue
 darasal, party netaa balbir punj nepradhanmantri ke is pahal kii ninda kii to varisht netaa shatrughna sinha se is kadam kaa swaagat kiya
 Significantly, Manmohan Singh did not miss any time on Sunday to congratulate Nawaz Sharif on his victory and also invited him to come to India on a mutually convenient date
 is jeet se sharif teesri baar pakistan ke pradhanmantri banenge
 The shocking thing was that when the PM gave the invitation, the counting of votes was going on in Pakistan
 piem ke is pahal ko aade haathon lete hue bijepi balbir punj ne kaha, 'pradhanmantri ko intjaar karnaa chahie tha
 Inviting Nawaz Sharif to India in a hurry is a wrong decision
 'balbir punj ne kaha, 'bharat ke prati pakistan ke ravaiye main kya badlaav aata he? iske liye piem ko intjaar karnaa chahie tha
 Should have waited for Nawaz Sharif's swearing-in
