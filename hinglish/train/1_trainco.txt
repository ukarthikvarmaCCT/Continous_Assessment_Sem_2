 Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has stressed the need to increase trade contacts to promote peace in the region, demanding the resumption of the suspended composite dialogue process with India
 kuraishi ne vaarta behaal karne kii baat karte hue kaha ki pakistan kii ruchi bharat ke saath sirf tasviren khinchvaane ke bajaay ‘nateeja dene vaali vaarta’ main he
 Qureshi said that Pakistan is not only demanding peace on its eastern border, but it is important for the region and it can best be promoted through trade contacts

 The situation on the two front is not in favor of Pakistan

 a 17-year-old girl, who went to a house in Khammam town to celebrate the birthday of a friend, was allegedly raped by four of her classmates
 police ne somvaar ko bataaya ki aropiyon ne is krity kii videography bhi bana lee
 The comments unhone bataaya ki ek nijee college kii degree kii ek chaatra ne somvaar ko khammam thri toun thana main ek shikaayat darj karai ki uske chaar sahpaathiyon ne do din pehle uske saath balaatkaar kiya
 The incident happened when she went to a birthday party
 ek varisht police adhikari ke mutabik, ladki ne bataaya ki aropiyon ne puri ghatana kaa video bhi bana liya or use kisi ke samaksh maamle kaa khulaasa nahin karne kii dhamkee di
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) He said that a student of a private college degree lodged a complaint at Khammam Three Town police station on Monday that four of his classmates raped him two days ago
 yah ghatana us samay hui, jab vah janmdin kii party main gai thi
 According to a senior police officer, the girl said that the accused also made a video of the entire incident and threatened her not to disclose the case to anyone

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) What is Audacity? At first, i felt that it was a struggle for Kejriwal to leave the Delhi chair and fight Benares
 phir mujhe laga bhaajapa kaa dilli chunaavon ke liye ghoshnaptr na laana dussahas he
 But the day i saw the Congress pulling out the manifesto for the Delhi elections, i got all the answers
 isse bada dussahas or kya ho saktaa he? vakt badalte der nahin lagati
 This is not seen by looking at Kiran Bedi, but by the circumstances of the Congress
 pichley dilli chunaavon main congress aam aadmi party ko ‘votakatwa’ kahati thi
 This time the Aam Aadmi Party can repeat the same thing
 pichley saal ke mukaable dilli main congress aisi upekshit lag rahi he, jaise garmiyon main renkot
 Despite this, Congress leaders are holding election rallies, which clearly shows that while there are few Gandhians left in the Congress, there are many optimists
 aise maukey par jab partiyaan menifesto laa rahi hai, nahin laa rahi hai, jabariyaa laa rahi hai, us vakt dilli ke behad aam aadmi (bina topi vaale!) ne swaprerana se ghoshnaptr jari karte hue tamaam rajnatik dalon ke saamne kuch maange rakhin hai
 Know more, what is special in the manifesto of the Aam Aadmi Party (BAAP)
 
 
 1
 Elections in Delhi are held every six months, first Assembly elections, then Lok Sabha elections and now again Assembly elections
 pichley ek-dedh saal se dilli ne sirf chunaav hi dekhe hai, jiske chalate vahaan rahane waalon ko chunaavon kii aadat pad gai he
 Sharma ji does not leave the house without seeing the face of any leader
 bachche chunavi chongon ke halle se dare bina doodh nahin pite
 Therefore, it should be ensured that elections are held at least every six months and everyone's heart is fixed
 2
 Don't take the name of Janlokpal, eat sticks, bat for two or two months; nattejey main haath aayaa anna ji kaa angochhaa
 The common man of Delhi has seen such a gimmick in the name of Janlokpal in the last few years that now the name of Janlokpal Bill is laughable
 isliye baaki kuch bhi karnaa, par plis janalokapal kaa naam mat lenaa

 In 2001, on this day i
e
 December 13, during the NDA regime, Parliament was attacked by terrorists of terrorist organizations lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed
 us hamale main 5 aatankiyon samet 14 log maare gaye or 18 ghayal hue the
 Indian security agencies claim that this whole incident was carried out by 3 dreaded terrorists Maulana Masood Azhar, Ghazi Babaurf Abu Jehadi and Tarik Ahmed in Pakistan
 us vakt centre main atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar thi or ab narendra modi kii aguwai main bhaajapa sarkaar desh main shashan kar rahi he
 But the real culprits of the terrorist attack on the Parliament called the temple of democracy have not yet been punished
 yun to bharat ne un teenon aatankiyon ko pakadaney kii kai baar koshish kii
 But even today all three of them are out of the grip of India
 jaankaree ke mutabik bharat ke wo dushman pakistan kii panaah main hai
 One of which, even today, there is no hawk by spewing poison against India
 aapako bataate hai ki bharat ke wo dushman koun hai or ab kya kar rahe hai
 The name Maulanamsood Azharka comes on the top of the Maulana Masood Azharkur terrorists, jaish-e-mohammed Azhar, who was roaming in Srinagar in 1994, was arrested in February
 is aatanki ko chhudaane ke liye 1995 main uske saathiyon ne kuch videshi paryatakon ko agava kiya
 However, one of them managed to escape while the rest of the tourists were killed
 iske baad 1999 main qandahar vimaan apharan kar aantki ne masood ajahar ko chhudaane main kaamyaab ho gaye the
 It was only after he left India during the Vajpayee regime that he conspired to attack the Indian Parliament
 wo yaheen nahin tehra, mana jaataa he ki 2008 main mumbai main hue aatanki hamale main bhi uski ahm bhoomika thi
 His role in the 2016 Pathankot terror attack is also considered suspicious
 bhartiya sena or suraksha agenciyon ne ajahar or uske bhai ko is vaardaat ke liye doshi mana tha
 After this, India exposed his acts internationally, after which Interpol issued a red corner notice against him for the second time
 bharat kii koshish rahi he ki ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kiya jaae, jis par america sahmati jataata he
 But China always veto in this matter
 uske sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ko bharat samet america, australia or england jaise kai desh aatanki group ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 Whereas in Pakistan he has a hero status
 bharat ke saboot dene ke baad bhi pakistan uske khilaaf koi ection nahin letaa
 Even after the Mumbai terror attack, Pakistan refused to arrest him
 usne yahaan tak kaha ki use nahin pataa ki ajahar kahaan rahata he, jabaki media report main bataaya gaya ki paak ke bhavalpur main rahata he
 At the same time, he remains a cherished ISI of Pakistan
 kai baar paak janata ko sambodhit karte hue uske video bhi viral hue, lekin paak sarkaar ko kuch bhi pataa nahin rahata
 Shah Nawaz Khan aka Doctor Ghazi Baba, the mastermind of the attack on the Indian Parliament, was shot down near Srinagar in August 2003
 us par na sirf sansad par hamale karne balki jammu-kashmir main kai aatmghaatee hamale kaa doshi mana jaataa he
 As part of an operation, the Border Security Force (BSF) killed the commander (operations) Ghazi, chief of Pak terror group jaish-e-mohammed, along with his accomplices in Nurbagh in an 11-hour encounter
 uske kai naam the, abu jehadi, shahabaaz khan, abu hizaarat
 But among his people, his most popular name was Doctor
 yah aatanki 1999 main qandahar vimaan apharan kaa mastermind mana jaataa he
 It was also the name behind the kidnapping of foreign tourists in 1995 to free Maulana Azhar
 tarik ahmedsansad par aatanki hamale ke ek or mastermind tha tarik ahamed, jo gaji baba ke saath kaam karata tha
 And at the behest of him, he started planning an operation
 is bich uski mulaakaat masood ajahar se hui or phir in teenon ne apni khatarnaak yojana ko aage badhaayaa
 Even after the attack, Tariq was staying in Pakistan
 haalanki iske bare main zyada jaankaree nahin he
 It is said in his bar that he has died
 haalanki koi agency abhi tak is baat kii pushti nahin karti

 mumbai vaasiyon ko garmi main safar karnaa museebatbharaa sabit hone ja rahaa he
 Best has decided to remove its AC buses from the streets of Mumbai in the summer
 iske peeche bason ko ho rahaa nuksaan vajah bataaya ja rahaa he
 Best has a total of 266 AC buses in Mumbai and travels between 18 and 20 thousand passengers per day
 best ne ek press note jari kar in bason kii sevaayen radd karne jaankaree di he
 Best expressed regret for the inconvenience caused to the passengers by this sudden decision
 best ke mutabik paas dharak us rute kii maryaadit bas seva kaa laabh le sakate hai
 At the same time, Best has also promised to return his outstanding money
 best prashasan ne achnaak se liye gaye is faisle kii vajah nahin bataai he
 But according to sources, this step has been taken as Best's AC bus service is running in deficit
 lekin ab 266 bason kaa kya hoga ye bhi bada sawaal he ? Best buses are the most important way to reach every corner of Mumbai city
 zyaadaatar log ghar se railway stesan jane or waapas ghar tak aane ke liye best bason kaa hi istemaal karte hai
 While AC buses run on long routes
 ye seva sadak par trephic kam karne ke liye shuru kii gai thi
 The comments best prashasan ko ummid thi ki bade vyapaaree or badi companiyon ke afasar apni car kii bajaay best kii asi bas kaa istemaal karenge
 This will reduce the number of vehicles on the road and reduce pollution
 lekin lagata he ki best kii ummid par pani phir gaya
 As a result, Best had to take a tough decision to shut down AC buses from 17 April due to rising losses
 mumbai main best kii kul 266 asi basen hai or pratidin 18 se 20 hazaar yatri usamen safar karte hai
 Best has issued a press note informing them to cancel the services of these buses
 best ne achaanak se liye gaye is faisle se yatriyon ko hone vaali asuvidha ke liye khed prakat kiya he
 According to BEST, pass holders can take advantage of limited bus service of that route
 saath hi best ne unke bakaayaa paise waapas karne kaa bhi vaada kiya he
 The Best Administration has not given the reason for this decision taken from Achanak
 lekin sutron ke mutabik best kii asi bas seva ghate main chal rahi he isliye yah kadam uthaaya gaya he
 But now what will happen to 266 buses is also a big question? mumbai shahar ke kone-kone tak jane ke liye best kii basen sabase ahm jariya hai
 Most people use only the best buses to go from home to railway station and back home
 jabaki asi basen lambey root par chalati hai
 This service was launched to reduce traffic on the road
 tippaniyan The Best administration hoped that big businessmen and officials of big companies would use Best's AC bus instead of their car
 isse sadak par vaahanon kii sankhya bhi ghategi or pradooshan bhi kam hoga
 But it seems that the hope of the best has been dashed
 natijan, badhate ghate kii vajah se best ne 17 april se asi basen band karne kaa kadaa faisla lenaa padaa

 saste ghar kii pariyojnaon main aapke liye ghar khareednaa kaaphi sasta ho saktaa he, lekin tab hi agar builder sarkaar ke nirdeshon ko amal main laaen
 The central government has asked the builders not to levy GST from the home buyers in these projects
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki in pariyojnaon par lagane vaala jiesti 8 fisadi he, jo input tex credit se edjust kiya ja saktaa he
 The central government has instructed all the builders on Wednesday
 usne kaha he ki saste ghar kii pariojaanaaon main ghar kharid rahe logon se jiesti nahin vasula janaa chahie

 In a statement issued by the Finance Ministry, it was said that earlier GST was 18 and 28 per cent for inputs and goods for house construction
 saste ghar ke sabhi projects par ab 8 fisadi jiesti lagegaa
 The ministry has said that this will benefit the builders and they will not have to pay any GST cash for the construction of the flat
 kyonki unke paas itnaa input tex credit ho jayega ki unka jiesti isamen hi edjust ho jayega
 Therefore, builders should not levy any kind of GST from home buyers
 mantralay ne kaha ki sielsaus skim ke tahat ghar kharidne vaale logon ko na sirf jiesti ki raahat daren deni hongi, balki unhen byaaj daron par sabsidi bhi milegi

 dhabas ke maalik ravindra ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ko icecream khilaa kar unhen bhi bahut khushi hui or yah bhi kaha ki rahul gandhi ne 2000 rupee kaa bill bhi bharaa

 The assembly election in Jharkhand has been sounded and the state leaders, once in the top positions, are facing the biggest challenge so far
 bihar se 15 november, 2000 ko alag kar nayaa rajya banaaya gaya jharkhand ab tak nau mukhyamantri dekh chukaa he
 The three-time Chief Minister of BJP, Arjun Munda, now faces a tough challenge to emerge as his party's favorite choice for the top post
 isi tarah, purv mukhyamantri or ek vidhayak vaali jai bharat samant party ke mukhiya madhu kodaa bhi rajnatik taraazoo par apana kuch vajan hasil karne ke liye kadi mashkkat kar rahe hai
 While other leaders are struggling to maintain their relevance, it is a battle for survival for the first Chief Minister of the state and the head of the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM), Babulal Marandi and the current Chief Minister Hemant Soren
 donon ko rajnatik takat santhal pargana se mili he, lekin donon ek-duusare se bilkul alag hai
 Marandi is a land leader
 unhone 1981 me bijepi jwine karne ke liye primary teacher kii naukari chhod di thi or antat: 2000 main mukhyamantri bane
 In contrast, Hemant became the first-time MLA and rose to the chief minister's post because he is the son of Shibu Soren, the chief of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)
 ab marandi or hemanth ko ek aisi chunavi jang main apana astitv bachaane ke liye ek-duusare se laduya he, jisamen bijepi kaa palada baari bataaya ja rahaa he
 There is room for anti-bjp votes in the state, but the challenge for both is how do they become the most reliable contenders for the anti-bjp political ground? Shibu Soren is noted for his leadership during the movement of separate state of Jharkhand
 janvari, 2013 ke baad jab unhone arjuna munda ke netritv vaali bijepi-jeemem sarkaar gira di thi to unke bete hemanth ko chah maah intjaar karnaa padaa
 After all, in July 2013, the Congress agreed to support the government led by Hemant
 39 varshiya hemanth saadhaaran kad-lathi ke hai
 His elder brother and veteran leader Durga Soren commanded the JMM till his death in 2009
 unke vipareet hemanth bahut chaalaak maane jate hai
 By the way, Hemant, who gained influence in the party after Bhai's death, has proved himself to be a clever strategist and decisive administrator
 loksabhaa chunaav main hemanth ke netritv main jeemem chaar siton par ladi thi jisamen do par use jeet mili
 This victory came at a time when the BJP in the state had defeated the entire opposition and won 12 out of 14 seats
 is samay shibu sorain adrdh ritairement vaale daur main hai or unke sakriy netritv sanbhaalane kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Hemant, on the other hand, has angered many seniors as they keep him away from the decision making process
 isliye hemanth ko ladaai kii kaman khud hi sanbhaalani hogi
 If he fails, his brief innings as an independent leader will be eclipsed
 (babulal marandi ke saamne karo yaa maro jaisi sthiti he)2009 se 2014 ke bich marandi ke liye to lagata he ki duniya hi palat gai
 His JVM contested 25 seats in 2009 and won 11 seats
 us vakt unki sarkaar na ban paane kii ekmaatr vajah yah thi ki unhone 81 vidhansabha siton main se sirf 25 par chunaav ladaa tha or baaki 56 sitempani saajheedaar congress ke liye chhod di thim, jo sirf 14 siten jeet pai thi
 But Marandi failed to get the expected results in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 ab, vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaari ke vakt marandi ke paas sirf teen vidhayak bache hai
 The latest rebellion in the JVM took place on October 28, soon after BJP won in Maharashtra and Haryana
 baaghmara se uske vidhayak dhullu mahato or gadwa se vidhayak satyendra nath tiwari bijepi main chale gaye
 Marandi faces the toughest challenge after a poor run in the general election
 jeviem apni pratishthapurna jamshedpur seat bachaane main to naakaam rahi hi, dumka seat se shibu sorain ko chunauti dene ke marandi ke dussahaspurn faisle se unka kad bhi gata he
 He finished third there
 jeviem ne sabhi 14 loksabhaa siton par apane ummidavaar utaare the, par vah sirf jamshedpur or godda seat par hi kuch dam dikhaa saki
 There his candidates Ajay Kumar about 3 lakh and Pradeep Yadav 1
 9 lakh vot mili
 Incidentally in Dumka, often called the second capital of the state, Shibu Soren's victory means a lot to Hemant
 hemanth dumka seat se vidhayak hai or phir vahiin se chunaav ladenge
 There is a perception in the state that BJP is ahead of others
 marandi or hemanth ke liye sabase badi chunauti isi dharna ko badalane kii he
 Hemant has also emerged as a leader capable of taking decisions during his innings as Chief Minister
 congress ke tunakmizaaj mantri chandrashekhar dube urf dadai dube ko hataane or varisht jeemem netaa hemlaal murmu ko bijepi jwine karne ke liye majaboor karne ke alaava hemanth ne cabinet ke varisht sahyogi simon marandi ko bhi baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 After the Lok Sabha elections, he also forced another Congress leader Yogendra Saw to quit the cabinet
 vastav main hemanth rajya ke akele aise mukhyamantri hai jinhone apni pari main teen mantriyon ko aakshamata ke liye baahar kiya he
 But he is not the leader as his father has been
 isliye bijepi se ladaai main hemanth ko apane pita kii chhatrachhaaya kii behad jarurat hogi
 In this way, there is going to be a multi-cornered contest, in which Hemant has a tough challenge to fight the BJP
 aise main ajasu jaise choti partiyaan kingmekar banane ke liye ji-tod koshish kar rahi hai
 The BJP hopes that it will emerge as the single largest party in the assembly
 aam dharna he ki congress or duusare dalon ke alaava hemanth or marandi gathbandhan banaakar bijepi kaa rasta rokane kii koshish karenge jisase ve 81 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main bahumat ke kareeb pahunch saken
 At present, the Congress, RJD and JD (U) have decided to fight together and Hemant is trying to convince the three to form an alliance with JMM as a senior ally
 hemanth kuch aisi siton par bhi daavedaari kar rahe hai jin par 2009 main congress lard chuki he
 They are contesting at least 45 seats which are not acceptable to the Congress
 is bare main antim faisla aana baaki he
 But the congress-jmm alliance is also likely to break
 vahiin marandi ne sabhi 81 siton par akele ladgaye kaa sanket diya he
 At the same time, there are also indications of his party's alliance with Congress and RJD
 unhen hameshaa hi kambek karne vaale shaks ke rup main dekha jaataa rahaa he
 After an unfortunate electoral debut in 1991, when Shibu Soren gave him 1
 34 lakh voton se haraa diya tha, marandi ne 1996 main phir isi seat par unheen ke khilaaf chunaav ladgaye kaa faisla liya
 Marandi was defeated again, but this time the difference of defeat was less than 6,000
 1998 or 1999 main marandi vijeta banakar ubhare or unhone lagaataar do chunaavon main shibu or unki patni rupi sorain ko haraa diya
 Because of this, he was made Union Minister of Forests and Environment in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government
 phir marandi jharkhand ke pehle mukhyamantri bane
 Marandi's life took another turn in March 2003, when four rebels from the Samata Party and one JD (U) minister were forced to step down due to tax revolt
 sarkaar se unke baahar ho jane ke baad bijepi ne unhen puri tarah se sidline kar diya
 Then in May 2006, they formed a separate party
 ve jaanate hai ki unke liye ye vidhansabha chunaav karo yaa maro jaise hai

 5 stardiarectionshram madhavanikalakaarsonam kapur, shabana azmi, shekhar ravajiyani or yogendra tikku5 sitambar, 1986 ko hijac hui pan em flite-73 kii ghatana bharat ke itihaas ke pannon main darj he, auraniraja bhanotki bahaduree kii kahani kehane ke liye kaaphi he
 a girl with some dreams who was a model and also an air hostess
 lekin vah flite ke dauraan aise halaat kii shikaar hui jisamen bahaduree ke saath dimag or sanyam donon kii darkaar hoti he or usne in sab ke sahi mishran kaa parichay dete hue aisa karnama kar dikhaaya jo har kisi ke boote kaa nahin hota
 Remembering this girl after almost two decades, that too on the big screen, is not an easy task
 lekin diarector ram madhavani ne is kaam ko bakhubi nibhaane kii koshish kii he
 He has also been successful in showing the atmosphere of the 1980s era
 diarector ne neeraja ke kai aayam dikhaae hai or vah bharat kii bahadur beti ke jivan ko rochak andaaj main dikhaane main safal bhi rahe hai
 It has become a good biopic
 kahani main kitna damaneerajaki kahani buhat log jaanate hai or jo nahin jaanate hai, unke liye film aa gai he
 The film attempts to give different shades of Nirinjake's life
 neeraja yani sonam kapur model he or air hostes banati he
 She is a fan of Rajesh Khanna
 uske har faisle main uske mata-pita uskaa saath dete hai
 But her flight gets hijacked and she gets caught in a situation where she has to think about other people before thinking about herself
 agar ek-aadh jagah chhod diya jaae to kahani thik chalati he
 However, Shabana Azmi's foreboding scene is a bit prickly
 phir hijac vaale prakaran main thodi gaharaai or honi chahie thi
 The reason for the hijack and the issues related to it have been kept slightly shallow
 star apiugar acting kii baat karen to sonam kapur ne thik-thaak hi kaam kiya he
 She has been brilliant in many scenes, but in most of the films, her acting has been similar to the first films
 vah neeraja ke kirdaar ko jitna acha kar sakati thim, unhone kiya he
 Shabana Azmeen has played Neerja's mother in an excellent manner and has captured emotional moments well on screen
 pita ke role main yogendra tikku ne bhi acha kaam kiya he
 Talk of earning Nirinjaka budget 21 crores
 bataaya ja rahaa he
 That is, the film is low budget and is a real-life story
 film main vah har masala he jo ise darshakon se jodne kaa kaam karata he, chaahe vah deshbhakti kaa jajba ho, ek ladki kii sahaspurn jindagi ho yaa phir aatankwaad
 The film also serves to moisten the eyes
 vaise bhi pichley hafte or is hafte bhi prem ko lekar bahut hi kamjor filmein relies hui hai or prem kaa ufaan-sa aa gaya he
 In such a situation, there is no doubt that Kirajarajas has been released on time and is a film made with the right intention
 pyaaj kii aasmaan chooti qimaton ke said effect dikhne lage hai, mumbai ke sayan ilaake main shanivaar ko 700 kilo pyaaj chori ho gaya
 Wadala Truck Terminal Police has also registered an FIR in the case
 tippaniyan When the shop owner Anand Naik reached his shop in the morning in the waiting town of Sion, he noticed that 14 onion-filled sacks were missing
 pyaaj kii keemton main badhotaree ko dekhte hue nike ne 1000 kilo pyaaj kharida tha, shuukravaar ko kaarobaar band karne ke baad jab shanivaar ko wo apni dukaan pahunche to unhone dekha ki pyaaj kii kai boriyaan gaayab hai
 Senior Inspector Suhas Garud of Wadala TT said, 'we have registered a complaint of onion theft
 ye vaaki main hairaan karne vaala he, lekin nijee sampatti kii chori hui he, isliye hamane maamla darj kar jaanch shuru kar di he
 Onion prices have risen wildly in the last one month, selling onion at Rs 57 per kg in Lasalgaon Mandi on Saturday, while it was priced at Rs 80 per kg in the retail market
 sayan ke pratiksha nagar main jab dukaan ke maalik anand nike subah apni dukaan pahunche to unhone dekha ki pyaaj se bhari 14 boriyaan gaayab hai
 Seeing the rise in onion prices, Naik bought 1000 kg of onion, after closing the business on Friday, when he reached his shop on Saturday, he noticed that many onion bags were missing
 wadala titi ke senior inspector suhas garud ne kaha, 'pyaaj chori kii shikaayat hamane darj kar lee he
 This is really surprising, but personal property has been stolen, so we have registered a case and started investigation
 pichley ek maheene main pyaaj kii keemten betahasha badi hai, shanivaar ko lasalgamv mandi main pyaaj 57 rupee kilo bika, jabaki khudara bazaar main isaki keemat 80 ru prati kilo thi
 Senior Inspector Suhas Garud of Wadala TT said, 'we have registered a complaint of onion theft
 ye vaaki main hairaan karne vaala he, lekin nijee sampatti kii chori hui he, isliye hamane maamla darj kar jaanch shuru kar di he

 desh ke ek bade samajashastri or bauddhik ashish nandi ne ajeebogareeb bayaan dekar bavaal khadaa kar diya he
 At the Jaipur Literature Festival, he said that Dalits, backward and scheduled caste tribes have the biggest hand in corruption in the country
 unke is bayaan par tikhi pratikriya aa rahi he
 See the expansion of the wisdom of Nandi, an intellectual of India, after 66 years of independence and 63 years of republic
 unke mutabik bharat main bhrashtachar sirf nichali jati, anya pichhadaa varg or anusuchit jati janajati ke log karte hai
 And see for example, Ashish Nandi of West Bengal says that West Bengal was the cleanest state under communist rule
 jahaan pichhadi jati ke logon kii satta se kabhi kareebi na ho saki
 The talk started at the Jaipur Literature Festival and reached far-flung areas of the country, the Congress spokesperson said that on Republic Day, such a thing does not suit anyone's mouth
 vahiin bijepi netaa minakshi lekhi ne kaha ki unke paas aisi kai misaalen hai jahaan agadi jati ke nami logon ke bhrasht hone kaa pramaan miltaa he
 However, some people present at the festival said that the reference to Ashish Nandi's statement was different
 wo ye kah rahe the ki amir or garib ke bich kii khai jab tak rahegi tab tak bhrashtachar rahegaa or nichalaa tabaka upar pahunchane kii koshish main bhrasht aacharan karegaa
 However, in the statement which he gave on the injury of Dunke, there is no evidence of this reference from anywhere
 duusari baat ye ki jis soobe ko unhone sabase saaf suthra qaraar diya wo pichley paanch dashakon main lagaataar neeche gira he or vam panth ke shashan main vah bhrashtachar ke duusare rup garh rahaa tha, jiskaa viksit or vibhats cheharaa abhi dikhataa he
 Book Name: Sunshine a Poetic Journey Lanes Author: Prasoon joshipublication: Rupa Publication Price: Rs 495 Just now it is sure that there is a fire in me
 
 
 upar likhi linon kii pahchaan bhale hi aamir khan kii film rang de basanti se ho lekin in linon ke peeche jo shaks he uski pahchaan bhi koi choti nahin
 Yes, this is the person who taught us to raise our head and drink and who told us that cold means coca cola
 or shaayad us naam se aap sab bhi anjaan nahin honge
 This name is Prasoon Joshi
 or prasoon kii likhi ye kitaab bhi maanon unki jindagi kii liriks jaisi he, kyonki is kitaab main prasoon ke un saare gaanon or kavitaaon ko jagah di gai he jisane apni ek alag pahchaan banaai he
 Multi Talented Prasoon Joshi is the CEO of a big ad agency, but his songs have left a distinct impression on our minds
 is kitaab main prasoon ne us jagah se shuruyaat kii he jab wo uttarakhand ke chote se shahar almoda main rahete the
 Prasoon's interest in poems made him an excellent lyrics writer
 prasoon ke likhe zyaadaatar gaanon or kavitaaon main aam jindagi kii parchaai dikhti he jisase koi bhi apane aap ko judaa hua mahasoos karata he
 In this book, Prasoon has compiled lyrics of most of his songs and poems
 in liriks ko roman main bhi likhaa gaya he saath hi angreji anuwaad bhi kiya gaya he
 Obviously, the scope of this book increases
 aamtaur par ham jab gane sunate hai to uske bol shaayad wo prabhaav nahin chhodte lekin jab ham usee gane ke bol ko padhate hai to uske shabd or arth kii gaharaai samaj aati he
 And this book gives us the opportunity to read the songs and understand its depth
 kyon padhebgar aap kavitaaon or gaanon ke shaukeen hai to ye kitaab pard sakate hai
 Although today, there are very few songwriters who make the song beautiful by playing with Hindi words, but Prasoon Joshi's name is in this list
 kyon naa padhebgar hindi ke shabdon or unki gaharaaiyon kii samaj naa ho to is kitaab ko padhane kii jahamat naa uthaaen
 Always an inspiration to youth, this book of Prasoon Joshi touches every aspect of life, irrespective of class or age
 vakt mili to ye kitaab jarur padhein or thodaa romani ho jaaen or thodaa shairana
 And yes, by remembering the songs written in this book, you can also come first in the Antakshari competition
 ant main prasoon joshi se ek guzarishrahana tuhai jaise tuthoda sa dard tuthoda sukunrahana tu he jaise tudhima dhimaa jhonkaaya phir jununthoda sa reshmatu hamadamathoda sa khurdurakabhi to ad jaeya lard jaeya khushboo se bharatujhe badalanaa naa chahunratti bhar bhi sanambina sajaavat, milawatna zyada naa hi kam

 Urbanization is the fundamental factor that increases demand for real estate and residential spaces in India
 philhal bharat main shahari aabaadi kul aabaadi kaa 31 fisadi he yani kul 37
 7 crore people live in cities
 taadaad main dekhen to america or britain kii puri aabaadi ke baraabar
 It is likely to increase further
 aabaadi main yah ijapha mahanagaron or jaipur, surat, patna, elahabaad jaise shaharon main khaas taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Gurgaon: The lack of resources, infrastructure and residential space for residents is also being felt in the emerging cities of the country
 anumaan ke mutabik 2031 tak shahari aabaadi saath karod ke str ko chhu jaaegi
 To meet the needs of such a huge population in cities, we have to build 7 million houses annually
 agle do dashakon main 35 nae shaharon kaa ubhaar bhi anumaanit he jo shaharon kii badhati aabaadi ko manage karne ke liye hoga
 Therefore, it is high time that the government break its inertia and identify ways of utilizing and allocating resources in a planned manner
 noida: sabase ooncha noidabadhati aabaadi, shaharon main palaayan or ekal pariwaron ke chalan se shaharikaran kii jo lahar uthi he, usne adhiktar bhartiya shaharon main rihaaish or vyavsaay ke liye zyada makaanon kii maang paidaa kar di he
 There is a lot of pressure on the housing sector, due to which it has increased by 32 per cent to meet the needs of the expanding population in the last decade
 iske baavjood madhyavargeey aay vaale logon ke liye kifayati makaan paryaapt sankhya main uplabdh nahin hai
 There is a huge difference between actual demand and supply
 jameen kii kami or uski badhati laagat ne samasya ko or gambhir bana diya he
 Ghaziabad: According to a survey by the new Habahal of Highrise, Indians have 100 square feet of space per capita in the cities
 maan len ki ek parivaar main ausatan chaar log hon, to prati vyakti yah aankada 25 varg foot baithta he
 Due to dwindling space and increasing population on the surface, minaret development is now becoming the preferred option
 isse shaharon ko or vruddhi main madad milegi, ve suniyojit tareeke se viksit hone ke alaava jameen kaa adhiktam upyog kar sakenge
 This concept of minaret development should not be understood as mere imitation of cities like Singapore and Shanghai 
 isaki bajaae bhartiya shaharon ko apni takat or kamajoriyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue apane tareeke se failana chahie
 Faridabad: The tiny Indian city of Minaris in the NCR seems ready for development
 noida iskaa jeevant udhaaharan he jo aaj haai-and lagjri projects ke centre ke taur par viksit ho chukaa he
 It is the choice of the people of the National Capital Region and is giving tough competition to neighboring Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Bhiwadi etc
 dhire-dhire meerut, jaipur, ranchi, indore or chandigarh jaise shahar bhi isi ke nakshekadam par bad rahe hai
 Private developers in these cities are trying to attract buyers by offering a place where not only retail services but all means of entertainment are available with multiplexes, gaming zones and all elite brands
 is tarah ve aaj ke un mahatvakankshi upabhoktaaon ko samoochaa package muhaiyaa kara rahe hai, jo apni jeevanstyli ko dobaaraa gande or pratishtha kaa har aadhunik tamgaa apane saath chipkaane kii khwaahish main vishwastareey brandon kii ore dekhte hai
 Ranchi: Today, metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata are going through the process of spreading themselves as their growth wheel has stopped
 thas yatayaat, chautarafa pradooshan or buniyadi sevaaon kii kami in shaharon ke liye kamajori ban rahi he
 As a result, the pace of development in their neighboring areas is fast and those areas are providing more practical accommodation to the middle class in the form of multi-storey buildings
 in ilaakon main bahumanjila imaaraton kaa chalan logon ko behatar jivan sthitiyaan de rahaa he
 Lucknow: The rising Nawabi city does not only get rid of the problem of congestion by giving everyone enough space, but it also decides that the people here have enough space to move around
 ye shahari dhaanche banaae hi is tarah jate hai ki jahaan tahalne-phirane yaa cycle chalaane kii jagah hoti he
 They can visit nearby markets and malls
 yahaan se achche sampark saadhan logon ko bason or train aadi tak pahunchane main madad karte hai
 In this way, free pollution-free accommodation from congestion becomes possible
 agra: bulandi ko choota shahardeshbhar main tamaam nijee develper bahumanjila imaaraten banane kii manjuuri paane ke liye license kii arji de rahe hai
 About 129 such licenses have been given to developers in Gurgaon area
 iske baavjood gudgaanv is baat kii misaal he ki ek shahar ko kaise viksit nahin hona chahie
 It can be considered synonymous with urban destruction
 aisa nahin ki dher sari bahumanjila imaaraten milakar shahar ke maujuuda halaat ko durust kar dengi
 If an area is not developed in a planned way, then the development of the tower cannot be a cure for the problems there
 niyojan aisa ahm pahalu he jisaki upeksha nahin kii ja sakati
 Patna: To touch the sky, there should be at least infrastructural infrastructure, while Gurgaon, as a city, rarely provides houses to live in huge offices and economically
 yahaan kii buniyadi naagarik sevaayen badahaal hai
 There is a huge imbalance in the residential and office space here as both of them are in the same place
 gudgaanv ke urban plansrs ne jo galati kii he, duusare shaharon ko usase sikh leni chahie
 a model is essential for any city that can provide economic growth, social inclusion and environmental balance as well as resources, movement and overall better living standards
 chandigarh / mohali: yahi he sapanom kii manzilrihishi vikaas ke saath kadam-se-kadam milaate hue daftaron vaali jagahon par bhi nivesh thos dhang se badha he
 Corporate institutions first wanted to open their offices in cities like Delhi and Mumbai
 ab ve lagaataar ghatate spes or mahanagaron main kaarobaar kii badhati laagat ke chalate pehle, duusare or tisare darje ke shaharon main bhi jane ko taiyaar baithe hai
 Today a new wave of hope is being created in cities like Bhiwadi, Faridabad, Gwalior, Patna, Raipur, Ludhiana, Lucknow, Jaipur as most of the industrial development is taking place around them
 in shaharon main pratibha, sthaneey technology or innovations kaa aisa sansaadhan aadhaar maujuud he, jiskaa dohan ab tak nahin hua he
 These cities are in the front line today and are wooing the corporate world by finding space for offices
 jaipur: sir uthaati sambhaavnaayenmegaplex kii mexican siries synapolis chand saal pehle jab bharat ke bazaar main ai to usne amritsar, bhopal, patna jaise shaharon ko chunaa
 Today it is choosing similar cities for its projects for the future

 Planned development can serve as a strong tool to deal with the challenge of dwindling housing and office space in urban areas and to broaden their horizons and be able to manage housing problems

 com / hvfhxmfc9k— robin gupta (@ robin21gupta) October 3, 2018 Explain that Kangana has worked hard to make her character appear real
 tiger se pehle kangana ke kai luk jari kiye gaye the
 "manikarnika" is directed by National Award Winner Director Krish
 kangana ranautki film relies se pehle kai vivaadon main bhi funs chuki he
 The actress was accused of non-reasonable interference

 Senior batsman master blaster Sachin Tendulkar may be rested against Australia in the next match of the one-day tri-series on Sunday, but if the past record is seen, then this step will prove to be a disadvantage for the troubled team
 Can
 pichley 22 varshon main bharat ne australia main mejabaan team ke khilaaf paanch maichon main jeet darj kii he or in sabhi main hameshaa tendulkar khele hai or unhone jeet main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 India first defeated Australia in Perth's Waka by a margin of 107 runs in 1991–92, and in this match, Tendulkar was the second top scorer by scoring 36 runs in 65 balls, while currently playing the role of chief selector
 Srikanth had scored 60 runs in 60 balls
 iske baad bharat ko dobaaraa australia ko haraane main 12 saal lage or isse pehle use lagaataar 11 maichon main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 In the year 2003-04, India defeated Australia by 19 runs in Gaba
 is match main sachin ne 95 gendon main aath chaukon kii madad se 86 ran banaae the or bharat ne 300 ran se zyada kaa score banaaya tha
 India won the next three matches in the 2007–08 series, which began in Melbourne
 bharat ne 159 ran ke score kaa peechha karte hue paanch wicket rahete jeet darj kii thi, jisamen tendulkar 54 gendon main teen chaukon kii madad se 44 ran banaakar sheersh scorer rahe the
 India then won their first one-day series in Australia by winning two consecutive finals
 sidney main pehle final main tendulkar ne 120 gendon main 10 chaukon ke saath 117 ran kii pari kheli thi, jisase bhartiya team ne chah wicket or 25 gend shesh rahete 240 ran kaa lakshya hasil kiya tha
 Two days later, the two teams were again in Adelaide in front of each other
 bharat ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue 258 ran banaae, jinamein tendulkar ne 121 gendon main saat chauke jamaakar 91 ranon kaa yogadan diya
 These figures reveal two things
 
 
 ek, tendulkar ab bhi australia ke khilaaf match main bharat kii jeet ke liye ahm hai or duusari, bhartiya team salaami ballebaajon (kisi ek salaami ballebaaj) ke aakraamak pradarshan ke bina kabhi australia ko nahin haraa pai he
 Because of this, the roles of both the openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir will have their eyes on
 sahvaag ne teen dauron main australia ke khilaaf 10 match khele hai, or unka sarvshereshth pradarshan 37 ran se adhik kaa nahin rahaa he
 He has scored 180 runs in these 10 matches at an average of 18
 iske vipareet gambhir kaa ausat sahvaag se kahin behatar he
 He scored 32 in seven matches against the host country
 86 ke ausat se 320 ran banaae hai
 He also scored a century of 113 against Australia in Sydney in the last tour of 2007-08
 viraat kohli, rohit sharma, suresh raina or manoj tiwari ke bich agar dekha jaae to australia main mejabaan team ke khilaaf in sabhi kaa anubhav kul milakar 10 match se zyada kaa nahin he
 Rohit scored a half-century in the first final of the last tri-series in 2008
 vaise unhone australia ke khilaaf saat match khele hai
 Other players have played only one match, adding only 37 runs
 tippaniyan The remaining league matches against Australia will prove to be quite challenging for Indian batsmen with or without the rotation system
 australia ke khilaaf bache hue teen lig match 12 farvari ko edilade, 19 farvari ko brisben or 26 farvari ko sidney main yojit honge
 If the rotation system works, as per team management's strategy so far, then Tendulkar can stay out of the Adelaide match and then play in Brisbane and Sydney
 lekin ab samay aa gaya he ki bhartiya team tendulkar ke balle ke bina kisi anya khilaadi kii ballebaaji se australia main uske khilaaf jeet darj kare
 It is well known that it will be very difficult to fill his place, but every batsman will have to try to prove his ability
 pichley 22 varshon main bharat ne australia main mejabaan team ke khilaaf paanch maichon main jeet darj kii he or in sabhi main hameshaa tendulkar khele hai or unhone jeet main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he

 is match main sachin ne 95 gendon main aath chaukon kii madad se 86 ran banaae the or bharat ne 300 ran se zyada kaa score banaaya tha
 India won the next three matches in the 2007–08 series, which began in Melbourne
 bharat ne 159 ran ke score kaa peechha karte hue paanch wicket rahete jeet darj kii thi, jisamen tendulkar 54 gendon main teen chaukon kii madad se 44 ran banaakar sheersh scorer rahe the
 India then won their first one-day series in Australia by winning two consecutive finals
 sidney main pehle final main tendulkar ne 120 gendon main 10 chaukon ke saath 117 ran kii pari kheli thi, jisase bhartiya team ne chah wicket or 25 gend shesh rahete 240 ran kaa lakshya hasil kiya tha
 Two days later, the two teams were again in Adelaide in front of each other
 bharat ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue 258 ran banaae, jinamein tendulkar ne 121 gendon main saat chauke jamaakar 91 ranon kaa yogadan diya
 These figures reveal two things
 
 
 ek, tendulkar ab bhi australia ke khilaaf match main bharat kii jeet ke liye ahm hai or duusari, bhartiya team salaami ballebaajon (kisi ek salaami ballebaaj) ke aakraamak pradarshan ke bina kabhi australia ko nahin haraa pai he
 Because of this, the roles of both the openers Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir will have their eyes on
 sahvaag ne teen dauron main australia ke khilaaf 10 match khele hai, or unka sarvshereshth pradarshan 37 ran se adhik kaa nahin rahaa he
 He has scored 180 runs in these 10 matches at an average of 18
 iske vipareet gambhir kaa ausat sahvaag se kahin behatar he
 He scored 32 in seven matches against the host country
 86 ke ausat se 320 ran banaae hai
 He also scored a century of 113 against Australia in Sydney in the last tour of 2007-08
 viraat kohli, rohit sharma, suresh raina or manoj tiwari ke bich agar dekha jaae to australia main mejabaan team ke khilaaf in sabhi kaa anubhav kul milakar 10 match se zyada kaa nahin he
 Rohit scored a half-century in the first final of the last tri-series in 2008
 vaise unhone australia ke khilaaf saat match khele hai
 Other players have played only one match, adding only 37 runs
 tippaniyan The remaining league matches against Australia will prove to be quite challenging for Indian batsmen with or without the rotation system
 australia ke khilaaf bache hue teen lig match 12 farvari ko edilade, 19 farvari ko brisben or 26 farvari ko sidney main yojit honge
 If the rotation system works, as per team management's strategy so far, then Tendulkar can stay out of the Adelaide match and then play in Brisbane and Sydney
 lekin ab samay aa gaya he ki bhartiya team tendulkar ke balle ke bina kisi anya khilaadi kii ballebaaji se australia main uske khilaaf jeet darj kare

 bharat ne iske baad lagaataar do final jitkar australia main apni pehali ek-divasiy shrunkhlaa main jeet darj kii thi
 In the first final in Sydney, Tendulkar scored 117 runs with 10 fours in 120 balls, helping the Indian team reach the target of 240 runs with six wickets and 25 balls remaining
 do din baad donon timen edilade main phir ek-duusare ke saamne thim
 Batting first, India scored 258 runs, in which Tendulkar contributed 91 runs in 121 balls with seven fours
 in aankadon se do baaten pataa chalati hai
 
 
 One, Tendulkar is still crucial to India's victory in the match against Australia and second, the Indian team has never been able to beat Australia without an aggressive performance by the openers (one of the openers)
 is vajah se donon salaami ballebaajon virendra sahvaag or gautam gambhir kii bhoomika par sabhi kii nazren lagi hongi
 Sehwag has played 10 matches against Australia in three rounds, and his best performance has not been more than 37 runs
 unhone in 10 maichon main 18 ke ausat se 180 ran banaae hai
 In contrast, Gambhir is far better than the average Sehwag
 unhone mejabaan desh ke khilaaf saat maichon main 32
 Has scored 320 runs at an average of 86
 unhone 2007-08 ke pichley daure main sidney main australia ke khilaaf 113 ran kii shatkeey pari bhi kheli thi
 If seen between Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina and Manoj Tiwari, the experience of all these against the hosts in Australia is not more than 10 matches in total
 rohit ne varsh 2008 main pichhali trikoniya shrunkhlaa ke pehle final main ardhashatak jamaaya tha
 By the way, he has played seven matches against Australia
 anya khilaadiyon ne keval ek-ek match khelaa he, jisamen inhone keval 37 ran hi jode hai
 The comments roteshan pranali ke saath yaa iske bina bhartiya ballebaajon ke liye australia ke khilaaf bache hue lig match kaaphi chunauteepurn sabit honge

 But when the elephant changed its mind, Mahavat could not control it and he fell along the road with Kripanath
 ye tasviir dekh aasapaas bhagdad much gai
 Soon the BJP leader's support reached him and raised him
 haalanki, ganimat ye rahi ki vah sadak kinare ghaas vaali sataha par gire, jiske chalate unhen koi chot nahin pahunchi
 But this incident faded his celebration
 upar lagi tasviir ko dhyaan se dekhie
 If you are interested in politics at all, then you must have heard the name of the party named 'lok Dal'
 ho saktaa he aapane 'hal jotata hua kisaan' (jise pashchimi uttar pradesh main 'khet jotata hua kisaan bhi kehete hai') vaale chunaav nishaan ko bhi dekha suna ho
 But you will hardly know the person seeing the banner of Lok Dal
 gaur kiijie ki binar par bilkul bich menmulaayam singh yadavaki tasviir lagi he
 After all, what is this matter? This person claims that Mulayam Singh Yadav is going to be the new president of Lok Dal after his son is sidelined in the party and all his candidates will now go to the voters with the same election symbol 'plowing farmer'
 is shaks ke daawey main kitni sachai he or yah sahab hai koun? ye bataane se pehle 'lokdal' ke bare main jaananaa jaruri he
 If you do a Google search to know the story of 'lok Dal', then everywhere you will see 'rashtriya Lok Dal', whose leader is Chaudhary Charan Singh's son Ajit Singh
 rashtriya lokdal se akhilesh yadav ke gathbandhan kii baat chal rahi he
 But now the father-son path is different, so this story can not be of Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal
 lokdal kii kahani shuru hoti 1974 main jab choudhary charan singh ne 'bhartiya lokdal' ke naam se apni party banaai thi
 Then its election mark was 'haldhar Kisan'
 immergency ke baad 1977 main indira gandhi kaa muqabla karne ke liye kai netaaon ne apni-apni partiyon kaa vilay karakar janata party banaai
 The election trail of the Janata Party formed by combining several parties also became Haladhar Kisan
 1977 main congress party ko haraakar janata party ne centre main sarkaar banaai
 After Morarji Desai, Chaudhary Charan Singh also became Prime Minister on behalf of the Janata Party
 lekin 1980 main aapasi matbhedon ke kaaran janata party tut gai or choudhary charan singh bhi usase alag ho gaye
 Now the party he formed was named 'lok Dal' and the election mark was 'plow plowing farmer'
 lokdal naam ki ye party 1987 main choudhary charan singh ke dehanth tak thik se chalati rahi
 At one time Devi Lal, Nitish Kumar, Biju Patnaik, Sharad Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav were also leaders of this Lok Dal
 1984 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jab bhartiya janata party ke sirf do saansad the tab lokdal ke chaar saansad hote the
 But after the death of Chaudhary Charan Singh, the battle of occupation of Lok Dal broke out
 kuch dinon tak hemavathi nandan bahuguna iske adhyaksh rahe
 But later, like the Samajwadi Party's fight, this battle also reached the Election Commission
 us samay bhi party par daawa karne waalon main khud choudhary charan singh ke bete ajit singh bhi shaamil the
 But in 2000, the Election Commission ruled that as Ajit Singh's son, he could inherit Charan Singh's property, but he could not inherit the party
 tab ajit singh ne rashtriya lok dal naam kii apni alag party bana lee jise vah abhi bhi chalaa rahe hai
 Here the real 'lok Dal' arrived after a long legal battle in the hands of Chaudhary Rajendra Singh, the Jat leader of Aligarh, who was once the leader of this party
 wo isi party se uttar pradesh main mantri bhi rahe or 1980 se 1985 tak vidhansabha main netaa virdohi dal bhi rahe
 Along with him, from 1982 to 1985, Mulayam Singh Yadav was the Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council on behalf of this Lok Dal
 lokdal ke binar par choudhary charan singh ke saath mulaayam singh kii photo lagaae baithe shaksh unheen rajendra singh ke bete hai jo pita ke dehanth ke baad kisi tarah se lokdal kaa naam or chunaav chinh apane paas banaae hue hai
 Sunil Singh was once a member of the Legislative Council of Uttar Pradesh but lost every election thereafter
 aaj ke din uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti main lokdal kii koi haisiyat nahin he
 The Lok Dal is listed as an Unrecognized Party of Uttar Pradesh in the Election Commission's list
 lekin sunil singh ke paas do puunji he- ek lokdal jaisi aitihaasik party kaa naam or doosraa uskaa chunaav chinh jis par khud mulaayam singh yadav 1980 or 1985 main do baar jaswantnagar se vidhansabha kaa chunaav lard chuke hai
 When was Sunil Singh going to revive the Lok Dal in the name of Chaudhary Charan Singh's legacy, but was not getting a chance
 jab samaajawaadee party main bete or baap ke bich than gai to sunil singh ko wo mauka dikhaa jisaki talash main wo barason se the
 As soon as Akhilesh Yadav took the post of Samajwadi Party's national president from Mulayam Singh Yadav, he immediately reached Netaji
 unhone mulaayam singh yadav se kaha ki wo aaen or lokdal ke adhyaksh ke taur par kaam sanbhaalein
 He has also talked to Shivpal Yadav about this
 sunil singh kaa daawa he ki mulaayam or shivpal donon ne is bare main vichaar karne kaa bharosa diya he
 But they will take the final decision when the bicycle election trail is snatched from them
 ravivaar ko unhone baqayada press conference karke yah baat media ko bataai
 So will Mulayam Singh take command of his old party Lok Dal to really fight his son? Will his candidates plow among the voters with the farmers holding the election symbol
 mulaayam singh ke log is bare main abhi khamosh hai kyonki unhen lagata he ki abhi aisi charchaa se samaajawaadee party or cycle chunaav nishaan par unka daawa kamjor dikhegaa
 But when Sunil Singh was asked that in the name of Lok Dal, people get the attention of the same Rashtriya Lok Dal with whom Akhilesh Yadav is collaborating
 is sawaal par sunil singh hansate hue kehete hai ki vah apane postaron main ajit singh kii photo lagaakar yah bhi likhenge- 'nakkaalon se saavdhaan! asli puraani dukaan yahi he'

 The US has decided to stop funding being given to Pakistan to stop terrorism
 white house ke sutron ne bataaya he ki 255 million dollar (kareeb sava 1600 karod rupee) kii funding ko roak diya gaya he
 The White House has confirmed this
 uski taraf se kaha gaya he ki aisi sahaayta is baat par nirbhar karegi ki pakistan apni sarajameen par aatankwaad kaa kis tarah jawaab detaa he
 That is, the United States, which has been claiming to support the constant terror on Pakistan, has now cleared its stand by stopping the funding
 pakistan se mila dhokhmerica ke raashtrapati donald trump ne pakistan par america ko 'jhooth or dhokhe' ke sivaae kuch na dene kii baat kahi thi
 In addition, the tweet said that in return for the assistance of 33 billion dollars in the last 15 years, Pakistan has done 'shelter' to the terrorists
 trump ke is twit ke baad hi america kaa ection saamne aa gaya or fund par roak laga diya gaya
 The news agency PTI quoted a senior administrative official as saying that the US does not currently have plans to spend $ 25
5 million in fiscal year 2016 for Pakistan
 unhone kaha, 'raashtrapati ne yah spasht kar diya ki america yah ummid karata he ki pakistan apni sarajameen par aatankwaadiyon or ugravadiyon ke khilaaf thos kadam uthaae
 The official said that the US administration will continue to review the level of cooperation of Pakistan

 Pakistan's Defense Ministry said in a tweet, "pakistan has given ground and air connectivity, military base and intelligence support to the US as an anti-terrorism aide which helped them to eliminate al-qaeda in the last 16 years but they Nothing gave us except abuses and mistrust

 sainya kshetra main 70 fisadi fundatankwaad ke khilaaf ladane ke liye america ne world trade centre par hamale ke baad khulkar pakistan kii madad kii he
 a large part of this budget has been given or used as military help
 jabaki shiksha or duusare madon main ek chauthai fund diya gaya
 According to the Center for Global Development, between the financial years 2002 to 2009 only 30 per cent of the funds in the economic items have been given
 jabaki 70 fisadi madad sainya kshetra main di gai he

 makaanon or flats kii booking ke baad pajeshan paane ke liye barason se intazaar kar rahenoedaorgaziabadsamet upi ke sabhi ghar kharidaaron ko badi raahat mil sakati he
 On Tuesday, home buyers of the long-stuck project 'take Homes' at uprerasenodesactor 137 demanded a takeover to complete the project itself
 techover kii maang shubhakamana tech homes ke ghar kharidaaron kii association ne upi rera ke sadsy balvindra kumaar se kii
 On which UP RERA decided to get 60 percent home buyers consent from home buyers
 upi rera ke sadsy balvindra kumaar ne kaha ki agar 60 fisadi ghar kharidaar sahmati de dete hai to phir vittiya sthiti kii jaankaree ke liye ek vittiya salaahkaar niyukt kiya jayega, jo project ke vittiya halaat kii baariki se jaanch karegaa
 The financial advisor will then submit its report to UP Rera
 is bich upi rera noida athurity se bhi unka paksh jaanegaa ki athurity apana bakaayaa nikaalane ke liye kya is prastaav ko hari jhandi dikhaaegi
 After this, UP Rera will give the final verdict on the takeover as per the proposal of Noida Authority and financial advisor
 agar shubhakamana tech homes ke ghar kharidaaron ko techover kii manjuuri milti he to noida or puure uttar pradesh main graahakon dwaara project techover kaa ye pehla maamla hoga
 There are many projects in noida-greater Noida which are up to 70-90 percent and those projects have been stuck for a long time due to the disappearance or non-work of the builder
 aise main ye faisla ghar kharidaaron ko aage badhkar apane ashiyane ko khud se puraa karaane kaa formula dilaa saktaa he
 Diwakar Sharma, one of the promoters of the auspicious group, is in jail
 jabaki, piyush tiwari faraar hai
 This is the reason why home buyers have proposed to complete their incomplete project
 haalanki, noida main jameen lij hold he
 Which is the first right of the authority and in most cases the amount of authority has not been paid and 90-95 per cent of the house amount has been recovered from the home buyers
 shubhakamana tech homes par bhi noida athurity kaa 80 karod bakaayaa he
 So this question will also arise here, how this amount will be paid and how the necessary amount will be arranged to complete the houses
 iske saath hi upi rera ne arth gracia bildcon privet limited ke maamle main faisla diya he ki greater noida athurity ko arth gracia project kii jameen bechakar apni rakam or graahakon kii rakam byaaj sahit waapas karne kaa vikalp talashna chahie
 Neither much work has been done in this project that it can be completed easily nor home buyers have paid according to demand
 in do maamalon se ye saaf he ki noida main pajeshan ke najadik pahunche or ekadam adhure projects ko puraa karne kaa rasta mil saktaa he
 Provided that all the parties concerned agree to it and seriously consider all the paths required to complete the project
 upi rera ke sadsy balvindra kumaar ke mutabik arth samooh ke teenon nideshkon ke jail main hone kii vajah se group kii do companiyon par ensielti main maamla chal rahaa he
 In which home buyers have been asked to present their claims before an interim resolution professional

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi held rallies in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh today
 is dauraan unhone congress par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that the work that four generations of Congress could not do, we have done in four years
 ab muqabla ho jaae ki congress ne chaar pidiyon ne kaam zyada kiya he yaa chaar saal main bijepi ne kiya he
 Addressing the election meeting in Shahdol, Prime Minister Narendra Modi further said that we have to give Madhya Pradesh a golden future
 yah hamako tay karnaa he ki madhya pradesh bhavishya main kis ore jaae
 The development that Madhya Pradesh is seeing today is due to the Bharatiya Janata Party
 pradhanmantri hone ke naate aap mujhase kaam kaa hisaab maang sakate hai
 Similarly, accounts should be sought from four generations of Congress
 congress ke munh main ram bagal main churi vaala hisaab he
 If they say that you built the road, then also ask them where your four generations had built the road
 piem modi ne madhya pradesh main congress ke shashan ko lekar aage kaha ki pehle naa to media kaa itnaa kawarej tha or naa hi soshal media kaa tab congress logon ko jhooth parosati thi or log use sach maan lete the, lekin ab samay badal gaya he
 Now there is truth in front of everyone who has done the work

 They lie so much that even at night, they will grow up lying in their sleep
 12 lakh logon ko de chuke hai ghar
 
 
 On the housing scheme, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that in Madhya Pradesh, we have given houses to 12 lakh people so far
 hamaara sapana he ki aane vaale vakt main bharat ke har parivaar ke paas apana ghar ho

 He said that rapists have been sentenced to death in five days in Madhya Pradesh

 Prime Minister's rally in Chhattisgarh's Ambikapur Before the election rally in Madhya Pradesh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the rally in Ambikapur, Chhattisgarh
 iske baad wo madhya pradesh ke gwalior or shadol main jahaan reliyon ko sambodhit karenge
 At the Ambikapur rally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that when the last time he came here, the people here had made Red Fort, that the rally made the people of Delhi sleepless
 jinhone ambikapur ko badnaam kiya he, unhen chun-chun is baar jawaab dene kaa mauka he
 The Prime Minister said that the courtiers have got the chance to sing songs of the same family, only people of Ambikapur can answer them
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki naksali bam-bandook se logon ko daraane kii koshish kar rahe the, lekin iske baavjood chhattisgarh ke logon ne baari sankhya main matdaan kiya
 Narendra Modi said that the government should always work for the poor, our government has worked for everyone without any discrimination
 jab atal bihari vaajapeyi ji nechhattisgarh, uttarakhand or jharkhand banaaya to kisi tarah kaa andolan nahin hua, lekin congress ne sirf telugana banaaya or itnaa bada hangaamaa hua
 Due to which Andhra pradesh-telangana suffered a lot
 congress ko bhai-bhai main ladaai karwaae bina chaiyn nahin padataa he
 Modi said in the rally that when Chhattisgarh was a part of Madhya Pradesh, Digvijay Singh was the Chief Minister there
 digvijay singh jis kaam ke liye chhattisgarh aate the, uske bare main main bol bhi nahin saktaa wo to logon ko pataa he
 When Chhattisgarh was formed, Ajit Jogi became CM, in the first 3 years, his government did not even see more than 60 percent of its promises
 nirmal baba se kii congress kii tulanapradhanmantri bole ki congress kaa haal tivi par aane vaale us baba kii tarah ho gaya he jo kehete hai ki doodh pite ho, nahin pite to pinaa shuru kar do krupa aani shuru ho jaaegi
 Modi said that Congress does likewise, if you vote, kindness will start coming
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki unhen lagata he ki angrej unke naam par hindustan karke gaye hon, unke parivaar kii chaar pidiyon ne desh par raaj kiya or aaj hamase hisaab maang rahe hai
 The Prime Minister gave the challenge to the Congress, PM said that i give accounts of my four years every day
 congress vaale abhi bhi aansu bahaate hai ki chywala desh kaa pradhanmantri kaise ban gaya
 He said that unless you understand democracy, then you will keep abusing the chaiwala
 unhone kaha ki ye kah rahe hai ki nehru kii vajah se chywala pradhanmantri bana, to ek baar 5 saal ke liye apane parivaar ke bina kisi ko party kaa adhyaksh banaakar dikhaa do
 The Prime Minister said that no one had problems with demonetisation, only one family is crying
 ham lut gaye, ham lut gaye
 
 
 My fight against corruption will continue
 agar aapane apni chaar peedi main kuch nahin kiya, to hamase kyon poochhate ho ki tumne chaar saal main kya kiya

 Let me tell you that Chanda Kochhar was facing charges for the loan given to Videocon Group
 un par aarope tha ki unhone videokon group ko lone dene ke dauraan aniyamitata barti or avaidh tareeke se nijee laabh liya
 In this, the name of Chanda Kochhar's husband Deepak Kochhar has also been revealed
 is maamle ke khulaase ke baad se hi chanda kochar ko 19 june 2018 se hi chuttee par bhej diya gaya tha
 In fact, ICICI Bank and Videocon Group investor Arvind Gupta accused Chanda Kochhar of wrongfully taking personal benefits in return for sanctioning loans worth a total of Rs 3250 crore to Videocon

 It is worth noting that the examination of the Secretariat Assistant was taken on 21 August 2016 by the Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission

 After this, the date of 27 November 2016 was fixed for the main examination

 There are allegations of large scale rigging and misuse of administrative posts by officers
 rakesh prasad chaturvedi 1997 main karnal pad se ritair hue
 His current pension is Rs 25,050
 he
 Whereas the pension of any colonel retiring from the same post after January 1, 2006 is about Rs
 35,841
 he
 Despite similar rank and equal duration of service, such discrepancies have been filled in the pension of soldiers retiring from the defense service
 agar 2006 se pehle koi faujee major general pad se ritair hua to use sirf 26,700 ru
 Pension, while Junior Colonel rank officer retires after 2006, when he gets nine thousand rupees
 adhik pension mil rahi he
 Not only the officer, the pension of retired soldiers, Nayak and Havildar before and after 2006 was also four thousand rupees
 kaa antar he
 Chaturvedi says, "the Subedar who retired from the post of Major in 1971 gets a pension equal to the hero who retires today
" ‘‘van rank van pension kii maang kii ek badi vajah yahi he ki baad main ritair hone vaala nichle pad kaa aadmi pehle ritair hone vaale bade ohadedaar se zyada pension kyon paa rahaa he
 Army personnel received 75 per cent of the salary at the time of retirement before the Third Pay Commission in the form of pension, compared to 33 per cent in civil
 1973 ke tisare vetan ayog ne raksha seva or civil kaa antar khatm kar pension ko aakhri vetan kaa 50 fisadi kar diya tha
 This battle of soldiers has been going on since then and so far eight commissions or committees have considered One Rank One Pension
 desh main har saal kareeb 65,000 faujee ritair hote hai or ek anumaan ke mutabik abhi desh main 23 lakh purv faujee hai, jinhone 2008 main indian eks sarviceman movement (iesam) naamak sanghathan banaakar purv phogiyon kii pension kii visangatiyon ko dur karaane ke liye teen dashak se chali aa rahi muhim tej kar di he
 The reason for this demand of former soldiers is that the policy of the government under which soldiers are retired at an early age for the purpose of keeping the army young
 lagbhag 85 fisadi sainikon kii ritairement 38 varsh, 10 fisadi kii 46 varsh or mahaj 5 fisadi kii 56 se 58 varsh kii aayu main hoti he
 While the age of retirement in civil is 60 years
 phogiyon ke andolan kii kaman sambhaal rahe leftinent general (rita
 ) Raj Kadayan tells India Today, "the soldier's soldiers are usually retired at an age when they have more responsibility
" sarkaar hamen bhi 60 saal tak naukari main rakhe, ham van rank van pension nahin maangenge
 However, it is interesting to note that the years of service of senior army officers are almost equal to those of civil officers
 phir bhi van rank van pension andolan kaa netritv faujee afasar hi kar rahe hai
 Comparing the constable of the Kadayan civil police and an army soldier, "A says," the soldier retires at 35 and the constable at 60
 agar vetan kaa bhi fark dekhen to sena ke sipaahi ko 60 saal kii umr tak main 47 lakh ru
 There is a loss of aapako jawan chahie jo kargil main mar sake, lekin use vaazib haq dene main bhi pareshaani ho rahi he
 In a gradual hunger strike in 2009, the troops returned thousands of medals to the President, and a million and a half former soldiers have tried unsuccessfully to hand over their blood-signed memorandum to the then President Pratibha Patil
 kadayaan kehete hai, ‘‘agle aam chunaav se pehle sarkaar ko phogiyon kaa haq dena hoga
 Our struggle will continue till we get the right under the purview of law and military discipline
 ‘‘in purv sainikon ne isi saal disambar main dilli ke jantar-matanr par apni takat dikhaane or farvari, 2013 tak intjaar karne kii ranneeti banaai he
 Although the government is not completely rejecting the demand for One Rank One Pension, it is expressing its inability to argue for lack of funds and legal hurdles
 rajyasabha kii yachika samiti ne bhi mantralay kii ore se di gai prashasnic, vittiya or kanoonee aadchan kii daleelon ko khaarij karte hue kadi sifarish kii thi ki jald se jald van rank van pension ko lagu kiya jaae
 But the government constituted a six-member committee under the chairmanship of the cabinet secretary on this report of the parliamentary committee
 kadayaan bataate hai, ‘‘is cameti main fouj ke pratinidhi ko shaamil karne kii maang teenon senadhyakshon ne kii thi, lekin sarkaar nahin maani
 "the government argues that if ex-servicemen are given the same rank equal pension before January 1, 2006, then the central government will immediately get around Rs 1,300 crore
 kaa atirikt boj padegaa
 The Ministry of Personnel has also expressed the possibility of raising such a demand on behalf of civilian pensioners
 lekin sansadeey samiti kahati he, ‘‘sarkaar kii yah ashanka niraadhaar he kyonki sainik rank ke aadhaar par ritair hote hai, jabaki asainik sarkari karmchaaree aayu ke aadhaar par
 Army work is more risky
 ’’ sansadeey samiti ne 1,300 karod ru
 The annual burden argument is also rejected
 lekin sarkaar kii ashanka ko railway union kii maang se bal mil rahaa he
 Sivagopal Mishra, general secretary of All India Railwaymen's Federation, says, "there is a difference in the pension of retirees before and after January 2006 also in railways, for which we are fighting
" phogiyon kii or hamaari maang vaazib he
 If we get one rank one pension in the army, then we will also get strength from it
 ’’ lekin is tarah banking se lekar piesu or sarkari karmiyon kii maang kaa antaheen silsilaa shuru ho saktaa he
 The Sixth Pay Commission further compounded the pension discrepancy when le
 karnal se major general tak ko ek running pe band main shaamil kar usne sabase nichle pe band kaa laabh diya
 That is, if an officer retires from the rank of Major General, then take it
 karnal str kii pension milegi
 It is also a question of prestige for the officers that the officer who later retires at junior rank starts getting more pension from them
 chathe vetan ayog ne iees ke liye enegsi (non functional apgrade) lagu kar diya, jiske mutabik koi iees sanyukt sachiv banataa he, to usase do saal senior batch ke sabhi iees ko bhi sanyukt sachiv str kii sari suvidhaayen milengi, bhale vah us str kaa kaam nahin kar rahaa ho
 There is a demand for implementing it in the defense service and to set a separate pay commission
 haal hi main 2,300 karod ru
 Despite the announcement of the package of one, the demand for One Rank One Pension remains the same
 jaahir he ki phogiyon kii pension visangati dur karne ke liye sarkaar ko ichhashakti dikhaani hogi or yah bhi sunishchit karnaa hoga ki van rank van pension ke baad railway, bankig yaa anya sevaaon se bhi aisi maang na uthe
 The governments of Punjab and Himachal have passed the resolution and supported the demand for One Rank One Pension

 Only then the alliance partners should decide
 'mahagathbandhan' ke bare main unhone kaha, "ham (ensipi) is tarah ke kisi mahagathbandhan ke bare main baat nahin karte

 Helpful and challenging spinners on the pitches of the subcontinent even better
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘main chahta tha ki riki bhi spinneron par usee tarah se dabadabaa banaae

 hamaare kisi paigambar ne kisi jaanavar kii koi qurbaani nahin kii he balki rahamat barti he

 raja rais ke mutabik jis qurbaani kaa hawala dekar bakreed main jaanwaron ko kaata jaataa he wo kabhi hua hi nahin
 This sacrifice is a festival of mercy, where life is found even after the sacrifice
 khud rasul ne jab apane bete kii qurbaani deni chaahi to allaah ne use jindagi bakshi
 Similarly, on the day of Bakrid, the killing of unruly animals is not justified anywhere

 Every lawyer has to start with the basic, there is no other short-cut in this case
 isliye aage kii taiyaari kuch aise karen
 Practice heavily: Mute courts or mock courts are the number one in classroom activities in all reputed law schools
 in nakli adaalaton main chaatr bahes karte samay apane kitaabi gyaan, vishleshnatmak yogyata or tark rakhane kii kushalta dikhaa sakate hai or is tarah ve khud bhi apni yogyata kii parakh kar sakate hai
 Such fake courts include activities such as drafting the case, presentation of the case and oral debate
 lau skulon main agar is tarah kii adaalaton kaa seoup acha ho to chaatro ko asli adaalaton jaisaa anubhav hasil hota he
 In these fake courts, where emphasis is on municipal law and regional cases, international competitions include public law, foreign policy law, maritime law, patent law, and intellectual property law
 pratishthit philip si jesp cap, jisamen har saal 700 se zyada lau skool hissaa lete hai, or oxford intelexual property lau mut court, jo har saal oxford vishvavidhyalay ke aitihaasik collejon main yojit kiya jaataa he, duniya bhar main hone vaali court kii pratiyogitaaon main sabase sammanit maane jate hai
 Bring Your Self Confidence a good lawyer is not one who has knowledge of the law, but one who knows how to use his information
 aap apana samay sirf pariksha par hi dhyaan dene main na kharch karen, balki koshish karen ki uniwarsity main jo sansaadhan uplabdh hai, unka zyada se zyada upyog kaise karen
 This will build confidence and you will also get a chance to know people from different backgrounds
 kitaabi keedaa na bane, vishleshan kii yogyata viksit karenkanoon ke har chaatr ke liye sanvaidhanik kanoon or in kanoonon ke tahat sambandhit cese ke kanoonon ko jaananaa anivaary he
 Every lawyer has to start with the basic, there is no other short-cut in this case
 kanoon ke chaatr ko apane andar kanoon kaa vishleshan karne kii yogyata viksit kerani chahie or cese kaa mul bhav pakadia chahie
 It is not so easy to catch the emotion, because the decisions of 400-500 pages have to be read deeply and then it has to be extracted
 puraa faisla cese kaa bhav nahin hota he
 Actually, this is the real reason behind the court's decision, which matters the most
 kanoon ke chaatro ke liye yah bahut jaruri he ki ve khud ko sirf gharelu kanoonon tak hi simit na rakhen
 They should study such cases in other tribunals, this increases the information and they can work on their cases better
 mukademe ko gambhirtha se lete hai to aapke liye antarrashtriya kanoon kii jaankaree bhi jaruri ho gai he
 Along with the technical knowledge of law, you should make a habit of studying
 mahapurushon kii jivaniyaan, aatmakathaayen or prasiddh pustaken padhuya jaruri he kyonki kanoon saamaanya gyaan par aadhaarit hai or kanoon kaa chaatr jitna adhik padhai karegaa utani hi samaj usamen paidaa hogi
 To maintain discipline is the subject of deep and complex, there is no guarantee of immediate success
 kanoon kii gambhirtha se padhai karne vaale chaatr ko parishram ke saath lambipadhai karne ke liye taiyararahana chahie, kyonki lau skool main kaam kaa boj bahut hota he
 If the student keeps himself disciplined, then this work can be easy for him
 lau skool ke chaatr ke liye anushaasit rahanaa bahut jaruri he
 If you work hard, you enjoy the class
 kanoon ke vishay kaa swabhaav kuch aisa he ki iske bare main apni samaj kii pariksha karke aap ise kahin behatar dhang se sikh sakate hai
 Students should make a timetable for themselves and implement it
 use padhai karne kii kala main maharath hasil kerani chahie or apane senior chaatro yaa adhyapakon kii salaah lene main kisi tarah kii kanjusee nahin dikhaani chahie
 Students especially benefit from studying in groups
 vakeelon kekariyar kii sambhaavnaaengis tarah vyapak hoti ja rahi hai, use dekhte hue yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki lau skool kii padhai apane aap main paryaapt nahin he or ye skool chaatro ko udyog kii lagaataar badhati maangon ko puraa karne ke liye kaaphi nahin hai
 a lawyer can gain practical ability in the courts only if he has been participating in law school societies, because there are many practical activities in these societies
 kanoon main technology kaa chhaunkkisi vakil ke liye jin gunon kaa hona behad anivaary he, unhen lau skool yaa kisi anya sambandhit jagah se sikhkar unamem puri dakshata hasil kii
 Some examples of this include interrogating a client, getting the point right, planning a trial, witness counseling, document discovery, negotiation with different parties, witness investigation, professional style, delegation, ethical compassion and time management
 vakil aisa shaks he jo nyaay dilaane vaala, court kaa adhikari or adhikaron kaa rakshak hota he
 Thus, it is the mission of problem solving, in which every context has to prepare itself for a new perspective and to become familiar with new realities and develop itself accordingly
 niyamon kii jaankaree unke saamaajik-aarthik or rajnatik sandarbh se judi hoti he
 You have to bring flexibility in your range of thinking to suit different thinking in the profession of advocacy
 course kaa vishleshan sahi akalan karnaa, vidhaayi vishleshan or legal research main dakshata laane main kanoon kii chid-faad karne kaa gun siikhnaa bahut jaruri he
 After setting your goals, you can achieve success by planning carefully and reviewing your progress at short intervals

 Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews admitted that it would take time to find an option for Kumar Sangakkara, who had retired from cricket but Upul Tharanga would try to make up for his shortcoming in the third Test against India starting on Friday
 tharanga le sakate hai sanga kii jagahmaithyuj ne match se purv press conference main kaha, 'sangakaara ke sanyas ke baad team main bache khiladiyon ne bahut test nahin khele hai
 It will take a long time to fill their gap
 ' sangakaara ke sambhavit vikalp ke bare main poochne par maithyuj ne tharanga kaa naam liya
 He said, 'tharanga can replace him
 pakistan ke khilaaf usne 46 or 48 ran banaaye the
 He dropped out of the team after Sangakkara's arrival
 ham acha ballebaaji kram talash rahe hai
 As of now, our batting order is not stable
 'mubarak rah sakate hai bahraaf spinner tharindu kaushal kaa is match main khelnaa sandigdh he unhen duusare test ke dauraan haath main chot lag gai thi
 However, the good news for the hosts is that fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep is now fit after being out of the second Test
 kushal janit perera bhi team main jehan mubarak kii jagah le sakate hai
 When asked if this was the right time for Perera, Mathews did not give a direct answer but indicated that it needed to be looked into
 unhone kaha, 'kisi khilaadi ko team main laane kaa parfect samay bataaya nahin ja saktaa
 i am sure he will do well when given the chance
 ' maithyuj ne sweekaar kiya ki teesraa test mejabaan ke liye kathin hoga
 The third Test will be difficult, he said, "it will be an important match as it is a decisive match
 wicket acchhee he or sporting he
 There is some grass on it
 hamen positive cricket khelni hogi
 The last match was played against Pakistan here
 iske baad wicket phir bichaai gai he lihaaja kaha nahin ja saktaa ki yah kisi hogi
 We do not pressurize curators to produce favorable wickets
 wicket jaisi bhi ho, ham sarvshereshth pradarshan kii koshish karte hai
 He added, 'both teams are new and are looking for the right combination
 unke paas achche tej gendbaaj or spinner he
 Whoever scores more runs and takes wickets will win
 mujhe donon tiimon main koi khaas fark najar nahin aata
 'input language rajasthan main shiksha ke bhagavakaran ko lekar ek baar phir se bavaal much gaya he
 This time, Rajasthan Public Service Commission, known as RPSC, has protested against the inclusion of part of Mahabharata in its examination syllabus
 darasal, kuch din pehle arpiessi ne rajasthan seva ke liye chune jane vaale arees kii hone vaali pariksha ke liye shaamil paathyakram menmahabharatake kuch anshon ko shaamil kiya he
 a new chapter called Ethics has been put up in which the dialogue between Shri Krishna and Arjuna before the war as a syllabus of examination to learn management
 saath hi yoga ko bhi management ke hisse ke rup main pariksha ke paathyakram main rakhaa gaya he
 Radheshyam Garg, chairman of the department's cleanliness RPSC, says that is a small part of the Mahabharata
 ise kai management collejon or uniwarsity main bataaya jaataa he or padhaayaa bhi jaataa he
 We have included the same here
 isamen kisi tarah se kisi dharm vishesh ko badhaava dene kaa koi prayojan nahin he
 However, in the same ethics subject, learning of management from the life of Mahatma Gandhi has also been placed in the syllabus, while the President of Rajasthan Teachers Association, Ramakrishna Agarwal says that it has been placed under the saffron agenda of the BJP government, which is being forced It is said that if a person of any other religion wants to become an officer in the state, then he has to read part of Mahabharata, remember it

 We are talking about the success of the entrepreneur and business Harikshan Pipple
 jinhone piples exports privet limited naam se company launch kii, jo antarrashtriya brands ke liye juute taiyaar karti he
 The children of IIM had studied this tea seller in ISRO, having spent childhood in Kamagribi, Pippal's father ran a small shop for making shoes
 aamadani zyada thi nahin thi isliye mushkil se ghar-parivaar kaa kharchaa chalata tha
 Harikishan began to work hard in his childhood for the expenses of education
 vahiin kam paison ke vajah se unke parivaar kaa kharchaa puraa nahin ho paa rahaa tha, jiske baad parivaar waalon ko bina bataae apane kisi rishtedaar se udhaar main cycle rickshaw maanga or chalaane lage
 Before the board examination, Modi's discussion with the students, the 10 successes did not recognize anyone while running the mantra, so they used to wear cloth on the face
 phir ek din harikishan ko ek factory main 80 rupee kii selary vaali naukari mil gai
 On the advice of his wife, Harikishan resumed his old shoe shop after taking a loan of Rs 15,000 from the bank
 haalanki paariwarik vivaad ke kaaran harikishan or unke parivaar ko ghar chhodana padaa

 di In Chhattisgarh, the two companies operating under the crop insurance scheme, Reliance and IFFCO, have been severely reprimanded by the government
 saath hi chetavanee di he ki yadi 10 may ke bheetar unhone kisaanon ko unki nuksaan hui fasal ke evaj main bime kii rakam nahin chukaai to company ke adhikariyon ke khilaaf aapraadhik maamla darj kiya jayega
 Both companies have been indulging in a long time in terms of repaying the insurance amount of about 2
5 lakh farmers
 yah rakam 353 karod rupee ke kareeb he
 Both companies had earlier promised to pay before 31 March 2018
 lekin nirdhaarit avadhi ke ek maah baad bhi wo apane vaade par khara nahin utari
 As a result, the farmers were blamed for this
 beemaa companiyon ke saath krishi vibhaag ke adhikariyon kii kai baar hui baithak ke baad companiyon ne fasal beemaa kaa aanshik bhugtan kaa vaada kiya tha
 The administration put its stamp on farmers by preparing cases of crop damage
 lekin 2 saal se bhi zyada vakt se maamla bhugtan ko lekar atka hua he
 However, it is still not decided whether these companies will be able to pay by May 10
 rajya chif secretary ne donon companiyon ke afasaron ko fatkaar bhi lagaai he
 Drought affected farmers of Chhattisgarh are yet to get Rs 353 crore under the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme
 sarkaar ne beemaa company reliance or iffko ko march tak is raashi ke vitaran ke liye samay diya tha, lekin april maah biit gaya or may kii shruwaat bhi ho gai, baavjood iske fasal beemaa kii rakam kisaanon ke khaaton main nahin ai
 Farmers have started preparing for the next monsoon crop
 is fasal ke bhi bime kii taiyaari shuru ho gai he
 In the meantime, this question is left open that when the amount of crop insurance has not yet been received, then what is the meaning of getting new crop insurance? jabaki beemaa companiyaan premium kii rakam sidhaa kisaanon ke khaaton se apane khate main transfar karvaa leti hai
 After this, the government has given an ultimatum to insurance companies to legally compensate for crop losses
 yah baat bhi saamne ai he ki kisaan bime kii rakam ke bhugtan main hui let latifi par byaaj kii maang bhi kar rahe hai
 Under the crop insurance scheme, crops of 12 lakh 94 thousand 189 farmers have been insured
 inamen se 2 lakh 50 hajaar kisaanon ko dhan ke fasal ke nuksaan kaa 353 karod rupee ab tak nahin die gaye hai
 Apart from paddy, soybean, tur, urad, maize etc
 crops have also been insured
 rajya ke mukhya sachiv ajay singh ne aalaa afasaron ke saath baithak kii
 Officers of both companies were also called in this meeting
 10 may ke pehle anivaary rup se paise vitarit karne ke nirdesh die hai
 Explain that both insurance companies had assured to deposit this amount in banks by 31 March
 baavjood iske kisaanon ke khaaton main fasal beemaa kii raashi jamaa nahin ho pai he
 It is said that Reliance Company insured the crop of farmers in 6 districts
 jabaki rajya ke shesh 21 jilon main iffko company ne fasal beemaa yojana ke tahat kaarobaar kiya
 On the other hand, both companies have not given any concrete reason for withdrawing from the payment of crop insurance
 donon hi companiyon ke afasar is maamle main media se bhi baatcheet karne se kataraa rahe hai
 Now it has to be seen whether these two companies pay the crop insurance amount by May 10 or any legal wager can refuse to pay the sum insured
