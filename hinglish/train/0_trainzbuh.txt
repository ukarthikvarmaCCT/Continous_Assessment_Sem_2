 After the stubbornness of all the Congress leaders and ministers and the assurance of Narasimha Rao's memorial being built in Delhi, Rao's family relented and agreed to perform the last rites in Hyderabad
 agle din yani 24 disambar ko tirange main lipati narsimha raav (pv narasimha Rao)kii body ko ek top gaadi (gan karij) main rakhaa gaya
 The family decided that his body should be kept for some time at the Congress headquarters before going to the airport
 yah vahi jagah thi, jahaan raav ne tamaam siyaasi mausamon ko dekha tha
 As per the wishes of the family, the cannon carriage carrying Rao's body was stopped near 24 Akbar Road, ie Congress headquarters adjacent to Sonia Gandhi's residence
 party mukhyalay kaa get band tha
 All the Congress leaders were present there, but the silence was tight
 sonia gandhi (sonia Gandhi) or anya netaa antim vidaai dene ke liye baahar aae, lekin get nahin khulaa
 Since the death of any leader, it was customary to keep his dead body at the party headquarters for darshan of common workers
 aise main raav ke parijanon ko is baat kii ummid bhi nahin thi ki aisa bhi ho saktaa he
 The cannon carriage carrying the dead body stood outside for about half an hour and then it left for the airport
 
 
 
 So Sonia Gandhi did not report the credit for the economic reforms and there were many other reasons apart from the Babri Masjid demolition scandal, due to which the relationship between Narasimha Rao and Congress increased
 unamem se ek badi vajah yah thi ki piem banane ke baad congress or khaskar sonia gandhi ko raav (pv narasimha Rao) se jis tarah kii apekshaayen thi, ve uske vipareet kaam kar rahe the
 The details of this have been given by Vinay Sitapati in Rao's biography 'the Half Lion'
 ve likhte hai, ''bakaul ke

 or unhone aisa hi kiya

 And i did and am happy to share about it with the intention of it being received with love
 As that's the only reason i am posting it
 Love for self and gratitude for the universe
 The picture might be disturbing for some, but these drains have become my dumbells for a few days
 i was detected with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) in my right breast with high grade malignant cells
 Simply put stage 0 cancer / pre-cancerous stage, with cancer cells multiplying in an contained area
 The result i have become a half Indian version of Angelina Jolie (since only one breast was involved)! i told my doctor now is the time to give some competition to the Kardashians since Pamela is passé
 But no one listened to me, so now i have a portion of my back tissue in my breast
 Perhaps now i can do chin-ups with my breasts! Jokes apart, this obstacle has given me a new definition of life
 Respect it's unpredictability and have the faith and courage to be the hero of your own drama of life
 The invincible human spirit is God like, gives you the courage to endure and the will to revive
 There is nothing that human spirit can't do
 Also i want women of all ages to be aware
 i am 35, and i was returned twice over from a mammogram
 If any symptoms come up, think of it as a protective force and get yourselves examined
 Also we are so obsessed with boobs
 This mastectomy has left me with even more self love! Big, small, left or right inclined , gravity pulling or defying, or even none, each breast the presence or lack of it has a story to tell
 Mine has made me a 2
 0 version of myself!

 a well-known businessman, former corporator and RJD leader was shot dead in broad daylight in Bhagalpur district of Bihar

 Police has started searching for miscreants
 vinod yadav ke shav ko police ne kabje main lekar aage kii karrwai shuru kar di he
 According to the police, there are several criminal cases against the deceased Vinod Yadav in Bhagalpur
 raashtrapati chunaav main upie kii pratyaashee banakar maidan main utrin purv loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar ko sabase bada jhatka unke apane rajya bihar se hi laga
 Meira Kumar's victory from this state under the UPA government was necessary, but the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's separate stance had to pay the price of Jagjivan Ram's daughter and like other states, NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind too was overwhelming here
 bihar se mira kumaar ko vot to achche khaase mili lekin wo kovind ko nahin pachhad sakin
 Kovind got a total of 22 thousand 490 votes from Bihar, while his rival Meera Kumar could get only 18 thousand 867 votes
 mira kumaar ke khilaadaae is nattejey kii sabase badi vajah mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or unki party jediu kaa ramnath kovind ko samarthan karnaa rahaa
 When Nath made Ramnath Kovind his candidate for the post of President, he was the Governor of Bihar at that time
 unke naam kii ghoshnaa hote hi nitish kumaar ne rajya kaa mukhyamantri hone ke naate kovind se aupchaarik mulaakaat kii or baad main elaan kiya ki unke man main kovind ke liye kaaphi sammaan he isliye unki party raashtrapati chunaavon main kovind ko hi samarthan degi
 UPA named Meera Kumar as candidate Kovind's name was announced after UPA declared Meera Kumar as their candidate
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne ise vichaardhaara kii ladaai bataaya
 Since then, everyone was eyeing whether Nitish Kumar would reconsider his decision and support Meera Kumar instead of Kovind
 mira kumaar ko bihar kii beti kaha gaya lekin nitish ne apana faisla nahin badla
 Nitish's reasoning was that Bihar's daughter Meera Kumar has been fielded to lose and if the Congress really wanted to give her any significant responsibility, she would have made her a candidate when the figures were in favor of UPA
 congress ko chahie ki 2019 main jeet kii ranneeti banaae or 2022 main bihar kii beti ko raashtrapati banaae
 Nitish's stance dictated that Meera Kumar would face defeat against Kovind in Bihar as the figures in favor of the NDA candidate after Nitish moved to Kovind's camp
 bihar vidhansabha main argedy kii 80, jediu kii 71 or congress kii 27 siten hai
 BJP 53 on the other hand has 12 mlas from other parties

 uttar pradesh ke aligarh main 55 varshiya mahila ko sirf isliye apni jaan ganvaani padi ki usne apni beti ko genes pahanane se nahin roka
 On Tuesday, a mother in Aligarh was hit by a mob so much that she lost her life
 is maa kaa kasoor sirf itnaa tha ki isane apni beti ko genes pahanane kii ijaajat di thi
 Even more shocking is that the mob that killed this mother was also led by a woman

 Phoolwati and a man named Ravindra Singh have been arrested in this case
 donon ko hi kamalesh kii hatya ke maamle main jail bhej diya gaya
 Netrapal, a driver by profession, told the police that Phoolwati had been objecting to her daughter Gunjan wearing jeans for a long time
 netrapal ke mutabik, 'meri beti undergrajuate student he vah genes pahanakar bahut sahaj mahasoos karti he
 Other girls in her college also wear jeans
 lekin contractor kii patni phulvati ek din mere paas ai or mujhe kaha ki main gunjan ko genes pahanane se rokun kyonki isse colony kaa maahaul dooshit ho rahaa he

 Is it possible to curb pollution in Delhi when it reaches a dangerous level? kya sarkarein ab tak kuch aisa prayaas karne main safal rahi hai, jisase kuch varshon main pradooshan kam hua ho
 These are some of the questions that are in the mind of every person living in Delhi NCR
 dukhad pahalu yah he ki in sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab na main he
 This is the report that shows why Delhi is not taking the name of reducing pollution
 dilli main naa paraai paraali jalaai jaati he or naa hi iton ke bhatte chalate hai, lekin uske baavjood bhi pradooshan dilli ko duniya ke sabase pradooshit shaharon main shaamil kar detaa he
 So the big question is what is the main reason for pollution in Delhi
 dilli main choti-badi hajaaron audyogic ikaiyaan hai, jinamein badi sankhya main koyala istemaal hota he
 There are plants like Badarpur Thermal Power, dhabas in Delhi or big five star hotels, there is no question about cooking tandoori everywhere
 lakhon dopahiyaa or chaar pahiyaa vaahan hai, har din nai kaaren sadakon par aa rahi hai
 Now the big question is whether the government has any interest in curbing them, or is it possible to remove them all from Delhi in practice
 pradooshan se jude maamalon ke vakil gaurav kumaar bansal kehete he ki kitabon main bhale hi pradooshan failaane vaali chizein band ho jaaen lekin vyavhaarik taur par unhen band karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Delhi is in such a dire situation in the matter of pollution and sadly it is well known to our policy makers
 iske baad rahi sahi kasar dilli main mount everest jaise oonche-oonche kooday ke pahaad hai
 As long as there is a fire in the gym and dangerous gas leaks from it
 desh kii teen badi court supreme court, dilli hoicourt or enjitipradooshan ke muddeko lekar gambhir hai lekin isko lekar sarkarein or adhikari gambhir nahin dikhte
 Recently, the NGT has also imposed a penalty of Rs 50 crore each on the two state governments in view of the negligence of the Delhi and Punjab governments in the matter of pollution
 sach puuchhie to naa ham apane vikaas par sanyam rakh paaen, naa industries par, naa apane dhabon par
 If Delhi has to provide cleanliness, then it is a long term process, on which the government and people will have to work seriously
 supreme court ke nirdesh par EPCA samay-samay par sarkaron ke liye disha-nirdesh bhi jari karata he
 But at some places, due to the will of the governments and at some other practical difficulties, the rules are not followed
 dilli main khule main aag lagane par puri tarah se pratibandh he, lekin dilli ke kisi naa kisi nukkad par kooda jalataa hua dikh hi jayega
 That is, how can the government control the pollution after laying down the rules on paper
 jab tak jamini taur par usko lagu na kiya jaae

 desh main loksabhaa chunaav or vidhansabha chunaav ek saath karaane kii bahes ek baar phir shuru ho chuki he
 Actually on Wednesday, Election Commissioner OP Rawat, who had come to attend an event in Madhya Pradesh, gave some statement about this
 apane bayaan main chunaav ayukta ne kaha tha ki sitambar 2018 ke baad hi ham bharat main ekasaath loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav karvaa sakate hai
 Their reasoning behind this was stated to be lack of necessary resources
 chunaav ayukta ke mutabik vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav ek saath karaane ke liye kul 40 lakh mashiinon kii jarurat hogi
 The Central Government had sought information from the Election Commission: The Election Commissioner said that the Central Government had sought information from the Election Commission in this regard
 jiske baad kendra sarkaar ne aavashyak dhanrashi uplabdh kara diya he
 The central government has given Rs 3400 crore for VVPAT machine and Rs 12 thousand crore for EVM
 chunaav ayog ne sarkari kshetra ke do companiyon ko order die gaye hai, sitambar 2018 tak sabhi mashine deliver ho jaaengi uske baad ham jab chahen ek saath chunaav karvaa sakate hai
 Let us tell you that in the constitution of the country, it is permissible that the Election Commission, according to its convenience, can get the election done 'before time'
 modi bhi chaahate hai kuch aisapradhanmantri modi bhi kai baar yah raay jaahir kar chuke hai ki lagaataar hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon se naa sirf sarkaar kii karypranali par asar padataa he balki isse desh par aarthik bhaar bhi padataa he
 Former President Pranab Mukherjee also advocated that while addressing the country on the eve of Republic Day, former President Pranab Mukherjee had also advocated for electoral reforms in the country
 pranab ne chunaav ayog se kaha tha ki vah raajnneetik dalon ke saath vichaar-vimarsh karke donon chunaav saath karaane ke vichaar ko aage badaye
 If this happens, in many states, the government will change together
 If all the political parties accept the appeal of the Prime Minister and the Election Commission and if they agree on the premier Lok Sabha elections, then the assembly elections of many states can also be held simultaneously
 darasal madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh or mizoram kii vidhansabhaon kaa kaarykaal november-disambar 2018 main samaapt ho rahaa he
 Apart from this, assembly elections can also be held in states like Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha with these proposed elections
 in rajyon kii vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal april 2019 tak he
 It is believed that if this process is implemented from the next Lok Sabha elections, in 10 years, the assembly elections in most states will be held along with the Lok Sabha
 'samay purv' chunaav ke peeche bijepi kii manshaagale saal november-disambar main khatm ho rahe 4 vidhansabha (madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh or mizoram) ke kaarykalon main mahaj mizoram hi he jahaan bijepi sattashin nahin he
 Apart from this, the BJD in Odisha and TDP in Andhra Pradesh benefited from the 2014 Modi wave
 is vajah se is baat kii ummid zyada he ki lagbhag sabhi rajyon main 'samaypurv' chunaav kii sahmati ban jaaegi
 According to political experts, the BJP is in favor of getting the Lok Sabha elections 'premature' because it has some idea that the 'magic of Modi' which was going on in 2014 is gradually getting sorted
 desh main bad rahi berogari, mahangaai or kisaanon kii samasyaayein sarkaar ke liye khatra banati ja rahi hai
 The fear that the situation will not get worse by 2019 has started haunting the top leadership of BJP
 ab aise main 'samay purv' chunaav agar hua to yah modi kii majaburi hogi yaa 'master stroke' yah to samay hi batayega
 Modi government is also making a ruckus
 In view of the elections, the Modi government has also decided to bring a strategic change in its working style
 kuch hafton pehle company barkele india kii ek report main ye baat saamne ai thi ki modi sarkaar apane bache kaarykaal main shaayad hi kisi mahatvapurn sudhaar par dhyaan de

 sikkim border par bharat or china kii sena aamane saamne khadi hai
 Due to this, Army Chief Bipin Rawat reached Sikkim on Thursday to review the situation
 is bich china ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa lu kong ne bharat se apni sena ko turant waapas bulaane kii maang kii he
 Kang said that we demand from India to withdraw our army immediately
 donon pakshon ke bich samjhaute or baatcheet ke liye yah purv shart he
 Let us know that there is tension on the border of China adjacent to the northeastern state of Sikkim for a week
 china ne bhartiya sainikon par border main ghusane or sadak nirmaan kaa kaam rokane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The Chinese army dismantled two of India's bunkers and said that they remained in the border of China
 beijing se bhi china sakht sandesh de rahaa he or border par maahaul bigaadane kaa aarope lagaataar laga rahaa he
 Where did the dispute start? Recently, the Indian troops protested against the construction of a road on the side of Donglong Menchin of Sikkim sector
 iske baad chini sainikon ne sikkim sector main bharat ke do banksron ko tod diya
 China is telling it in its border
 bhartiya sainikon ne chini sena kii is karrwai kii virodh kiya
 Since then, thousands of soldiers of both countries are standing face to face
 darasal china border par bharat ne apni taiyaariyaan majboot kii hai
 China is unable to digest the construction work of the Indian Army of the new bunkers in place of the old bunkers and is calling it provocative action
 china kii kya he aapattiyambhartiya bunker hataae jane kii ghatana june ke pehle saptaah main sikkim ke doka laa ilaake main hui jisase sikkim kshetra main bharat-china seemaa par tanaav paidaa ho gaya
 The history of china-india border dispute is quite long
 donon deshon ke bich 3,488 kilometre lambii seemaa he jo jammu-kashmir se lekar arunachal pradesh tak he
 Of this, 220 km falls in Sikkim
 chunki is ilaake main border line puri tarah spasht nahin he, isliye koi spasht aadhaar nahin he seemaa kaa
 The Bhutan connection to the Learn dispute: Indian troops protested against the construction of a road from China in Donglong area of sikkim sector
 vahaan china kaa kahana he ki ye seemaa bhutan se lagati he or bharat teesraa paksh he
 He does not have the right to speak in this, whereas the truth is that India looks after Bhutan's foreign and defense affairs and India has the right to resolve this issue with China
 china ko bhutan par bharat kaa ye prabhaav raas nahin aa rahaa
 What did the Chinese Foreign Ministry say? China's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying - Hopefully countries respect the sovereignty of other countries
 china-bhutan seemaa nirupit nahin he, kisi tisare paksh ko is maamle main hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie or gairjimmedaarana tippanee yaa karrwai nahin kerani chahie
 China accused India of a secret agenda and said if a third party intervenes with a secret agenda, it is an insult to Bhutan's sovereignty
 ham aisa nahin dekhnaa chaahate kyonki bhutan antarrashtriya samudaay dwaara samprabhutaa kaa hakdaar he
 China legalized road construction in the Sikkim sector and insisted that it was being built in the Chinese region, which neither belonged to India nor Bhutan
 unhone kaha ki kisi anya desh ko hastkshep karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 India is not getting ready on the border, the Indian government has intensified military preparations along the China border in the last three years
 piem modi ne china seemaa ke liye 1 lakh sainikon kii mountain strike kor banane, france se 36 rafel ladaaku vimaanon kii deal, samandar main navy ke liye america se gardian drone kii kharid, america ladaaku vimaan F-16 kaa bharat main nirmaan, hovitger top kii kharid samet kai kadam uthaae hai jisase china baukhalaayaa hua he
 Apart from this, steps have also been taken for the development of basic amenities in areas bordering China
 jaise china border ke paas globamaster vimaan kii lading, assam main china seemaa tak jane vaale sadak pul kaa nirmaan, leh tak rail maarg kaa vistaar aadi kai kadam aise he jise china border par bharat kii badhati taiyaariyon ke rup main dekhtaa he
 Friendship with America is also knocking China
 PM Modi's visit to America is also very shocking
 trump-modi kii dosti kii tasveeron ke baad china kii pratikriya ai thi ki bharat gutnirpekshata kii apni niti chhodkar america ke saath china ke khilaaf khadaa ho rahaa he ye bharat ke liye vinaashkari sabit ho saktaa he
 Why China cannot become a natural friend of India? On many matters, two neighboring countries India and China are face to face
 haal main dalai lamas kii arunachal yatra ko lekar bhi china ne aapatti jataai thi
 Whereas India described that pure spiritual journey
 isse pehle bharat ne china-pakistan kii sipiisi project se duuri banaai thi tab bhi china ne bharat par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 China has also been a hindrance in India's entry into the NSG
 pakistan se sakriy hafiz said samet tamaam aatankiyon par bain lagavane kii bharat kii koshishon main bhi china adnga lagaataa rahaa he
 In the South China Sea too, India along with the US and Japan have been opposing China's Dadagiri
 ye sabhi baaten china ko khatkati rahi hai
 In such an environment, there is little scope for cooperation between China and India
 isko dhyaan main rakhte hi bharat aage bad rahaa he

 utari dilli nagar nigam or dakshini dilli nagar nigam main civik centre ko lekar aapas main hi khinchataan shuru ho chuki he
 The interesting thing is that the BJP is in power in both the municipal corporations
 darasal civik centre main utari dilli nagar nigam or dakshini dilli nagar nigam kaa mukhyalay he, lekin dilli nagar nigam ise apana hissaa bataati he
 The same tenant to the Municipal Corporation of South Delhi
 isi mudde ko lekar utari nagar nigam ne notice jari kiya he ki kiraye ke rup main dakshini nagar nigam unhen paisa de
 It is clearly stated in the notice that if the rent money is not given within seven days, then there will be lockouts in their offices and it will start from the commissioner's office
 utari nagar nigam ke mutabik dakshini dilli ne jab se yahaan unke daftar bane hai tab se ek rupee bhi nahin diya he
 From the year 2012 to 2016, a total of 810 crore rupees are made, but even after giving several notices, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation has been seen to be upset with this matter
 darasal utari dilli nagar nigam pehle se hi vittiya sankat se guzar rahaa he
 In this case, recovery has to be done from all the defaulters of the corporation
 is baar nigam sakht kadam uthayega, kyonki dakshini nigam ne abhi tak notice kaa jawaab bhi nahin diya he
 On the other hand, officials of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation say that the civic center was constructed when three MCD Ekathi and all the three municipal corporations were invested at that time
 emsidi ke vibhaajan ke baad civik centre kaa 40 fisadi hissaa dakshini dilli ko 40 fisadi hissaa uttari dilli ko or 20 fisadi hissaa purvi dilli nagar nigam ko mila
 Whereas the East Delhi Municipal Corporation has been given the headquarters, which has been given by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation
 is hisaab se dakshini dilli ke paas 60 fisad hissaa he, lihaaja kirayedar to uttari dilli he
 The UP government fulfilled the promise of loan waiver of farmers in the first meeting of its cabinet
 lekin isamen kitni hakeekat he or kitna fasaana ye tarkon or aankadon ke jaal main funs gaya he
 Loan waiver has been announced from banks for loanee farmers up to Rs 1 lakh
 iske liye sarkari khajaane par 36 hajaar 359 karod rupee kaa boj padegaa
 That is, the share of small and marginal farmers in the total number of 86 lakh rupees is divided by 36 thousand crores, each farmer gets a little more than 16 thousand rupees
 ab upi ke kisaanon kaa aankada dekhen to kul do karod 34 lakh kisaan hai
 Of these, about 20 million are small and marginal farmers
 is sankhya main ek karod 85 lakh yani kareeb 80 fisadi seemaant or baaki bache 13 fisadi chote kisaanon kii hissedari he
 Marginal farmer has an average of 0
 45 se 0
 There is 50 hectares of land
 aise main wo jameen ko girvee bhi rakhen to 50 hajaar rupee se zyada kaa karjto use mil hi nahin saktaa
 64 lakh 14 thousand farmers in Uttar Pradesh have a total debt of 86 thousand 241 crore from scheduled banks
 sahakaari bainkon ko bhi shaamil karen to inase 6000 karod rupee kaa rin
 That means a total loan of Rs 92 thousand 241 crore
 sarkaar ne maafee kaa elaan kiya sirf 36 hajaar 359 karod rupee kaa karja
 Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala's response was that in the light of the statistics of agriculture and farmers in Uttar Pradesh, debt is also of two types
 ek to fasali or doosraa miyadi yani turm lone
 Most farmers now take loans only for tractors, bulls or small threshers
 kyonki fasal kharaab bhi hui to kiraaye par ye mashine dekar kuch bharpai kar saken
 There is no provision for its amnesty or subsidy
 yani rin maafee ke liye bhi aise-aise praavdhaan ke pecho kham hai ki karje ke kolhu main pis rahe chote khetiharon main se nau man tel to kam hikisaanon ke paas hoga
 Then even Radha will dance with the government

 south ke diggaj actor prabhas (prabhas) or bollywood actress shraddha kapur (shraddha Kapoor) kii film 'saaho (saaho)' ne relies hone ke saath hi cinemagharon main dhamal machaa diya he
 This film full of action has received mixed response from the audience
 isse itar 'saaho (saaho)' ne box offis par bhi pehle din dhuandhar opening kii he
 But recently Bollywood actress Lisa Ray has accused Saaho of theft
 'saaho' par chori kaa aarope lagaate hue lija re ne apane instagram account se ek photo share kii he
 In one photo, the original background is seen, while in the second photo, a scene of the film 'saaho' is seen, in which Prabhas (prabhas) 'saaho' and Shraddha Kapoor are also present
 What is creativity? What is art? Where does it come from? We know what it is not
 It's not your social status
 It's not your job title
 It's not your appearance
 It's not even the image you see in the mirror
 Creativity and its sister Art reach us from the sweet spot of the universe- the soul you might say- through mystery
 But i do know that the creator- artist is the channel for it
 Let me tell you how hard it is to birth anything original or authentic
 i personally labored for years over my book, quelled the doubts and noise from others and didn't emerge until i had almost undone myself
 Because it's a calling
 And when i was moving through dark spaces of self-doubt or hitting creative blocks, i would turn to the work that @shiloshivsuleman puts out into the world and shares on her Instagram handle for inspiration
 i can recognize when a creator works honourably and deeply, bleeding, sacrificing, unsleeping, stretching herself in the direction of emotional bravery to produce work that births those feelings we all look for in day to day life
 To feel inspired
 To feel alive
 That's why when something dishonorable happens, we need to stand up and speak up
 To hold up a mirror to these makers to make them understand THIS IS NOT RIGHT
 It's come to light that a big budget film production has ripped off one of Shilo's original creations
 This is NOT inspiration but blatant theft
 In no world, is this acceptable
 The production did not contact the creator, ask her permission nor offer to collaborate or offer a credit
 Nothing
 This is not right
 i believed the Hindi film industry was evolving necessarily past stealing storylines and rampant plagiarism but the producers of Shahoo have obviously not gotten the memo when it comes to art
 Here's the thing- Creators are worthy of worship
 What they produce are more lasting and precious so than all the other ‘things' we accumulate that can be taken away
 Let's hold these producers accountable for their infuriating, dishonourable action
 How would you feel if a thief slid into your home and took away your most prized possessions? Your heart
 Your soul
 And your livelihood

 apni post main unhone likhaa, "hamen iske liye aage aana chahie or nirmaataaon ko aainaa dikhaanaa chahie ki jo kuch inhone kiya he vah thik nahin he
 It has been revealed that this big budget film has twisted Shilo's composition in its scenes
 yah prerana nahin, balki ek chori he, jo puri duniya main kahin bhi sweekaarya nahin he
 Even the production has not thought of talking to the artist in any way, taking permission from them and giving them credit
 "lija re (lisa Ray) ne apni post main aage likhaa, "nirmaataa puja karne yogya hai
 Everything he makes is more valuable than other things
 aaiye in producers ko unki achook or beyimaani ke liye javabdehi tehraaen
 "please tell that there has been no response from the Saaho team regarding these allegations of Lisa Ray

 The equation is something like this
 agar andhra pradesh kaa vibhaajan nahin hoga to tiares, jagan reddy or chandrababu naidu kii party tidipi bijepi kaa samarthan chunaav main karti
 But TRS will support the Congress after the bifurcation of the state
 jagan bijepi kaa saath nahin denge kyonki vah andhra pradesh ke bantwaare ke khilaaf hai
 Now the BJP is trying to spoil the game plan of the Congress 
 usne is disha main pahal karte hue sanvaidhanik sanshodhano ke liye dabaav daalaa he
 It has argued that giving powers to a new governor is a constitutional matter and will require amending the constitution
 agar bijepi apni yah maang manwaane main safal ho jaati he to bill ko loksabhaa main phir se bheja jayega jahaan ise paas karaane ke liye upie ko na keval do tihaai bahumat chahie hoga balki sadan ko sucharu rup se chalaanaa bhi hoga
 Both things do not seem possible

 She has also made preparations to thwart any attempt to link the matter with the amendment of the constitution

 oparation 15 agast
 This is the story of the conspiracy that was unfolded, when Saint Asaram Bapu, who appeared to others, had to visit the jail himself
 15 agast 2013 kii dopaher jodhpur se 40 kilomatir dur ekantavaas main kya kuch hua
 When, how, and what intrigues did Asaram Bapu and his four disciples plan for preparing for this August 15? Since when did Asaram lie behind that minor girl? All these things, all the stories, all the truth and complete intrigue will be in front of you and tell you how Asaram was sentenced to life imprisonment
 chhindwara gurukul, madhyapradesh, janvari 2013saal 2013 kii shuruyaat thi
 Asaram Bapu was coming to Chhindwara after six years
 chhindwara main hi baba kaa gurukul he
 In which about eight hundred girls study
 is gurukul main lagbhag 70 ladkiyaan barahavin kaa imtehaan dene kii taiyaari kar rahi thim, jabaki kareeb-kareeb itani hi ladkiyaan gyarahavin se barahavin main pahunchane vaali thim
 She was one of the same girls who were going to 12th from Gyarav
 
 
 jis par baba kai maheenon se nazaren gadaaye the
 Actually, Baba first saw the girl in Uttarakhand in 2012
 use dekhte hiasaram babaaki niyat kharaab ho gai
 Later it was found out that the girl studies in Baba's Chhindwara Gurukul
 havasabhari sajishchhindwara pahunchane se pehle hi baba ne apni khaas sevadaar shilpi ko gurukul kaa warden banaakar chhindwara bhej diya
 And with that began the story of the lust-filled plot whose climax came out on Independence Day i
e
 15 August
 asaram kii niyat bhaanp chuki thi peeditababa ke aadesh par chhindwara gurukul pahunchate hi shilpi ne ladki ko bahakaana shuru kar diya
 She started trying to prepare him to go to Baba somehow
 koshish jari thi
 But the girl was not ready
 darasal, uttarakhand main baba se pehali mulaakaat ke dauraan hi ladki asaram kii niyat bhaanp chuki thi
 But he did not tell this thing to anyone then
 ladki kaa bhai bhi chhindwara gurukul main hi pard rahaa tha
 He felt that telling the family would spoil the education of both siblings
 shilpi ne ladki ko bataai bhootpret kii batvakt bitta rahaa
 Shilpi continued to celebrate the girl
 par baat nahin bani
 The efforts released from January were also failing by July
 ab agast kaa maheenaa aa chukaa tha
 Baba's patience was breaking
 ab or intjaar mushkil tha
 The pressure on the artisan was continuously increasing
 badhate dabaav ne shilpi ko ek duusari chaal chalane par majaboor kar diya
 He now started convincing the girl that she was possessed by ghosts
 wo use bataane lagi ki kaise uskaa man kisi kaam main nahin lagata
 Why does she stay in the bathroom for two-and-a-half hours? Shilpi threw the real trap by putting the ghost's words in the mind of the family, ready to show Baba
 usne ladki se kaha ki agar wo ek baar khud ko baba ko samarpit kar degi to saare dukh sari beemaari dur ho jaaegi
 But the girl aware of Baba's intention was still not ready
 tab shilpi ne aakhri daanv khelaa
 He contacted the girl's parents in Shahjahanpur
 unhen bataaya ki shilpi par bhootpret kaa saaya he
 Once shown to Baba, it can be cured
 shilpi kii baat sun kar ladki ke pita to taiyaar nahin hue alabatta maa jarur maan gai
 Shilpi also told the girl's parents that both of them can go with Baba for treatment
 ye sun kar ghar vaale raji ho gaye
 The girl who was ready for forced treatment After the family members agreed, now the girl was also ready to be forced to get treatment from Baba
 shilpi ne ye khabar fouran phone par asaram ko di
 Asaram's phone always picks up Shiva, his personal attendant
 vahi phone baba ke kaan par lagaataa he
 Preparations started to send the girl to Baba as soon as the news was received
 ladki ko bulaane ke liye rakhwae pravachanshiva ko jimmedaari di gai ki wo jodhpur main baba kaa pravachan rakhwae, taaki usee pravachan ke dauraan ladki ko jodhpur bulaayaa ja sake
 The responsibility of Shilpi was to bring the girl from Chhindwara to Jodhpur and Sharat Chand was tasked to make arrangements to send Shilpi and the girl to Jodhpur
 iske baad shiva ne 9, 10 or 11 agast ko jodhpur main baba ke pravachan kii taarikh tay kar di
 As soon as the date of the talk was fixed, news was given to the girl's family
 lagaataar asaram se baat karti rahi shilpiye sab kuch paanch agast ke aasapaas hua
 After this, from August 5 to August 15, Asaram, Shiva, Shilpi and Sharat Chand were having about thirty phone conversations every day
 paanch agast se pehle yaa pandrah agast ke baad in chaaron ne kabhi itani baar baat nahin kii
 Asaram reached the farm house after the lecture, Asaram reached Jodhpur as soon as the preparations were completed
 teen din kaa pravachan unhone puraa kiya
 Then on August 13, he reached Deora farm house in Madai village, 40 km from Jodhpur
 jise wo ekantavaas kii kutiyaa bulaate hai
 Meanwhile, the girl's parents had also come to Jodhpur
 unhen tab jodhpur me hi baba ke paal ashram main rakhaa gaya tha
 Girl arrives at farm house with parents, on 13 August, the girl arrives in Jodhpur from Chhindwara with Shilpi
 railway stesan par khud asaram kaa nijee sevadaar shiva donon ko risive karne aata he
 The girl spends the night of August 13 at the Pal Ashram with her parents
 iske baad 14 agast kii subah shiva ladki or uske maa- baap ko lekar asaram ke ekantavaas vaali kutiyaa yani farm house pahunchataa he
 In the farm house, Baba's personal cook Prakash cooks for the girl
 use doodh detaa he
 Then in the evening for the first time Baba comes in front of the girl
 maa-baap saath main the
 There were other people too
 baba unhen pravachan sunaate hai
 Bless you phir tay hota he ki asaram 15 agast ko ladki kaa ilaaj karenge
 The order of treatment in solitude, on 15 August, the girl is present before Baba in the afternoon
 maa-baap tab bhi ladki ke saath the
 Sometime Baba talks to the girl's parents
 phir hukum sunaate hai ki ladki kaa ilaaj wo akele kamare main karenge
 Because solitude is necessary for treatment
 baba kaa aadesh sunate hi ladki ke maa-baap us kamare se kuch dur kar die jate hai
 Shiva had already left the girl with Baba
 kamare ke kareeb ab bas baba kaa rasoiyaa prakaash tha
 The girl goes inside the room and the door closes
 ladki ko sammohit kar asaram ne mitaai havamb band kamare main bas asaram or ladki thi
 Baba first hypnotized the girl and then started fulfilling months old lust
 par shaayad baba ke sammohan kaa puraa asar ladki par nahin hua tha
 So she started opposing Baba's obscene act
 tab baba ne use dhamkee di ki agar usne jubaan kholi to chhindwara gurukul main pard rahe uske bhai or maa-baap ko jaan se maar diya jayega
 Fearing the threat, the girl became silent
 ladki ko waapas shahjahanpur bhejaphir dedh ghante baad band kamare kaa darwaja khulaa
 The girl quietly came out of the secluded hut with her parents and reached Jodhpur in the evening and then left for Shahjahanpur that evening
 udhi baba bhi 16 kii subah ekantavaas se baahar aae or jodhpur ke raste dilli nikal gaye
 Where he had a lecture from 19 August
 peedita ne ghar jaakar mata-pita ko sunai aapbeeteeis bich shahjahanpur pahunch kar ladki main himmat ai or usne apni maa ko sari baat bataa di
 The mother told the father and then the whole family reached Delhi on 19 August

 Ask Baba
 par baba ne milane se manaa kar diya
 Therefore, on 20 August, in Kolkata, Kamla Market police station in Delhi wrote a report against Baba
 or is tarah oparation 15 agast sabake saamne aa gaya
 Because of which Baba's real face was revealed to the world
 or adaalat ne usee kaali karatuut ke liye asaram ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai

 ‘‘ham yah kar sakate hai
 '' sardi ke mausam main twachaa ko adhik dekhbhaal kii jarurat hoti he, khaastaur se psoriasis ke marijon ko is mausam main kaaphi saavdhaan rahanaa chahie
 Due to the cold and dry weather, the red colored surface appears on the skin of the patients of Psoriasis and the skin repeatedly appears dry - dry, chapped and lifeless
 psoriasis ek auto immune avasthaa he, jisamen saamaanya se kahin zyada teji se twachaa kii nai koshikaayen banane lagati hai
 Our body produces new skin cells every 10 to 30 days, which replaces the old cells, while in psoriasis disease new skin cells are formed quite rapidly, which does not give the body enough time to shed the old skin cells
 
 darasal, isse twachaa yaa chamadi par hi moti parat jam jaati he
 It emerges as a red colored surface on the skin
 isse twachaa shushk ho jaati he
 It starts to itch
 sharir par laal yaa silver rang ke dhabbon ke rup main chakatte ubhar aate hai
 Dr
 Dermatology and Cosmetology HOD of Artemis Hospital, Gurgaon
 monica bambaru ne sardiyon main psoriasis kii beemaari par kaabo paane ke liye upaay sujhaaye hai
 - Use moisturizing soap or body wash: a harsh soap can change the natural ph of the skin, causing itching or other discomfort on dry skin
 neutral piech level vaala sope yaa body wash kaa istemaal karnaa chahie, jisase twachaa main nami barkaraar rahati he auratvachashushk nahin hoti
 Avoid using loofah soap while using body wash
 kyonki isse aapaki twachaa kii pareshaani or bad sakati he
 - Oatmeal Bath: For this kind of bath, take a cup of oatmeal and put it in lukewarm water
 isamen kuch boonden aap khushboodaar tel kii mila sakate hai
 Bathing with this lukewarm water can relax your skin and soften dry, red rash or skin rash, causing itching and burning
 jab oats pani ke sampark main aate hai to vah gelatin jaisi film banaate hai, jisase twachaa surakshit hoti he or usamen nami bhi aati he
 Avoid rubbing the skin while bathing, as this increases the itching and irritation of the patient's skin and the red colored surface can also rapidly emerge on the skin
 - skin kriim yaa moishcharizer lagaaein:dinabhar apni twachaa ko nami se bharpoor rakhen
 For this you are advised to apply skin cream or moisturizer twice a day
 - cloding:oonee kapade twachaa main jalan kar sakate hai or isse papadiyaan jam sakati hai
 During winter, patients with psoriasis are advised to wear thin cotton clothes under woolen clothes
 is tarah ve sardi ko bina kisi papadi hone kii chintaa ki bagaiyr maat de sakate hai
 - Take sunlight: Due to not getting proper sunlight during winter, one's skin can also become dull
 dhoop kaa adhik se adhik anand uthaaen or ghar ke baahar samay bitaayen
 This will not only increase vitamin d levels, but will also improve your mood

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday unveiled the world's tallest statue of independent India's first Home Minister Vallabhbhai Patel, but the ceremony did not see LDA Advani, the first Home Minister and Iron Man of the first NDA government
 adwani sonia ke saath sansad main dikhe
 Both along with many leaders paid homage to Patel
 bhaajapa ne hi adwani ko chote sardaar or louhpurush kaa khitaab diya tha
 Advani was still there when the statue was unveiled in 2013
 'stachu of unity' ke udghaatan ke avasar par gujarat ke mukhyamantri vijay roopaani, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah, madhya pradesh kii rajyapal or gujarat kii purv mukhyamantri anandi ben patel samet kai bade netaa maujuud the
 But the absence of Advani, MP from Gandhinagar in Gujarat, is bound to raise questions
 modi-shah ke daur main adwani bijepi ke maardarshak mandal main shaamil kar die gaye the
 Since then, he is rarely seen on political platforms
 bijepi ke louhpurush kahe jane valeadwanndie kii pehali sarkaar main grih mantri or phir uppradhanmantri bhi bane
 Full credit goes to the atal-advani pair for making the BJP stand out
 aaazaad bharat main vallabhbhai patel bhi pehali congress sarkaar ke grahamantri the, unhen bhi up pradhanmantri kaa pad saunpa gaya tha
 Just as Sardar Patel was known for his firm decisions, it was also believed that Advani is adamant on the decisions he takes
 bhaajapa ke logon ne pehle unhen chote sardaar kii oopaadhi di, baad main unhen louhpurush bhi kaha jane laga
 On October 31, 2013, Narendra Modi had laid the statue of Patel on Sardar Patel's birthday, when Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 adwani kaa kad tab party main mahatv rakhata tha
 On the occasion of the foundation stone, the two were lighting a lamp together
 yah vah daur tha jab centre kii upie sarkaar apane din puure kar rahi thi
 The image of the UPA government was tarnished due to the presence of all the scams and scams
 bijepi ne aakraamak chunavi abhiyaan chalaaya or narendra modi ko apana cheharaa banaaya
 With this, the end of Advani era and the rise of modi-shah era started in BJP
 duusari ore, adwani pehle se hi piem banane kii tamanna dil main paale baithe the
 During the 2009 election campaign, Advani was seen as PM in waiting but the BJP could not win and the UPA returned to power
 2013 aate-aate sangh se hari jhandi milane ke baad modi aage bad chuke the or adwani ko apana rasta tay karnaa tha
 After the formation of the government, he was brought to the Board of Guides
 tab se adwani siyaasi manchon par kam hi dikhte hai
 Advani did not appear on Wednesday to unveil the statue of Sardar Patel
 murti kaa anaavaran karte hue modi ne kaha ki meraa saubhaahgya he ki mujhe sardaar sahab kii is vishaal pratimaa ko desh ko samarpit karne kaa avasar mila
 When i envisioned it as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, i never felt that as Prime Minister i would get an opportunity to do this pious work
 is kaam main jo gujarat kii janata ne meraa saath diya he, uske liye main bahut abhaari hum
 But people are raising questions today as to why the MP from Gujarat, Advani, who led Modi and lit the lamp with Modi during the foundation stone of the statue, was not present at the inauguration ceremony
 sardaar patel kii yah murti sardaar sarovar baandh se 3
 At a distance of 2 km, there is a place called Sadhu Bet which is an island on the Narmada River
 yah sthaan gujarat ke bharuch ke nikat narmada jile main he
 Somnath's temple is also not far from where Advani started the rath yatra in the 1990s and created a wave in favor of BJP across the country

 Due to the printing press being its limit, the government was unable to replace the demonetised notes with new notes, which caused overnight 75% of the currency to disappear overnight and it took several months to improve

 vitt mantri arun jettli ne is bare main patrakaron ko jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki rail mantralay kaa bajet ab aam bajet main hi shaamil karne kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 The reasoning behind this is that there are many ministries whose annual budget is more or equal to the Ministry of Railways
 aise main rail mantralay ke bajet ko alag se pesh karne kaa koi auchity nahin he
 The Debroy Committee of the Ministry of Railways had already suggested for this
 vitt mantri ke mutabik rail bajet ko aam bajet main milaane ke baavjood railway kaa kaamkaaj swatantra taur par pehle kii tarah hi chalata rahegaa
 The railway will continue to be run commercially as a separate department

 Indian Railways will no longer pay any dividend to the Government of India for the financial year 2016-17

 In this way, the Railways is now free from the financial burden of paying dividend of about 9700 crores every year
 gauratlab he ki alag rail bajet pesh karne kii parampara 1924 main shuru hui thi
 The intention behind presenting the railway budget separately was that the Railways needed a huge amount of money separately at that time and its economic importance was very high in the whole country
 rail bajet ko aam bajet main milaae jane ke peeche sarkaar kaa tark he ki isse railway ko centre stage par laane main madad milegi or sarkaar ko railway kii vittiya sthiti ke bare main thos yojana banane main madad milegi
 One big thing is that there is an agreement between the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of Railways regarding the right to increase rail fares, in the coming days, the Rail Tariff Authority will be created to increase the fares
 aam bajet main rail bajet ke marjar ke baad bhi rail mantralay ko nai railgadipoon or pariyojnaon ke elaan kii chhot hogi

 Those have been quashed by the court
 justise sikri ne kaha ki aadhaar act main maamuli badlaav karne kii jarurat he

 The BJP has already announced that it will not allow the upcoming monsoon session till Tejashwi resigns from his post
 vahiin duusari taraf bhaajapa nitish ke upar bhi dabaav bana rahaa he, taaki agar tejasvi khud istipha nahin dete hai to mukhyamantri unhen apane mantrimandal se barkhaast kar den
 In this sequence, BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi attacked Nitish and said that the Chief Minister's condition has become like a pilot of a hijacked aircraft
 modi ne kaha ki mahagathbandhan banane ke baad argedy supremeo lalu prasad ne nitish ko mahagathbandhan kii driving seat par baitaane main anakani kii or ab lalu chaahate hai ki mahagathbandhan kii gaadi ko bhrashtachar ke gahare gadde vaali sadakon par utaar di jaae
 It is worth mentioning that RJD leader Taslimuddin had made an aggressive attack on Nitish 2 days ago and said that Nitish praises the policy of zero tolerance against corruption as if he himself was a milkman
 argedy saansad taslimuddin ke isi bayaan par modi ne kaha ki tejasvi ko bachaane ke liye argedy ab yah kutark de rahi he ki bihar main sarkari daftaron main ab bhi bhrashtachar jari he or isi vajah se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jiro tolerance kii baat karnaa mahaj dikhaava he
 One thing is certain that this time the monsoon session of Bihar Legislative Assembly is expected to be very turbulent, because BJP has made it clear that till Tejashwi Yadav resigns from his post, he will not let the House run, on the other hand
 RJD has also made it clear that Tejashwi will not resign at any cost
 aise main sabaki nigahen ab mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par tiki he or is baat kii jaankaree bhi mil rahi he kitejasvi ko lekarmansoon satr se pehle hi nitish koi bada faisla le sakate hai

 yah saaf he ki is kavayad main sushamaa swaraj kuch peeche chhuti rah sakati hai
 He will be excluded from the four niche ministries

 In the year 2017, Pak month Ramadan will start from 27 or 28 May
 agar chand 26 may ko dekha gaya, to ramajaan 27 may se shuru mana jayega
 Ramadan means sharp
 ramadan islam calendar kaa nauvaan maheenaa hota he
 It is believed that Muhammad 610 came to know about the Quran Sharif on the occasion of Leylat ul-qadr in 610 AD
 bas usee samay se ramajaan ke is maah ko ek pavitra maheene ke taur par manaaya jane laga
 During Ramadan, fasts are kept for one month
 is dauraan, buree aadaton se tauba kii jaati he
 Roses started with new moon ends 30 days later with new moon
 roje ke dauraan kuch baton kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhana hota he
 There are many rules to follow Roja
 - Lenten does not mean nothing if you eat, but keep thinking about eating
 roje ke dauraan khaane ke bare main sochan bhi nahin chahie
 According to Islam, fasting on five things is considered broken
 ye paanch baaten hai- badanaami karnaa, laalach karnaa, peeth peeche buraai karnaa, jhooth bolnaa or juthi kasam khaanaa
 Roje simply does not mean to stay hungry and thirsty in the name of Allah
 is dauraan aankh, kaan or jeebh kaa bhi roza rakhaa jaataa he
 This means that neither see anything bad, neither listen nor speak bad during this time
 roje kaa mukhya niyam yah he ki rojaa rakhane vaala musalmaan suryoday se lekar suryaast ke dauraan kuch bhi na khaae
 It is also forbidden for a woman to think about bad thoughts or physical relationships in the course of fasting
 sahari, roje kaa ahm hissaa he
 Sahri means morning
 roje kaa niyam he ki suraj nikalne se pehle hi uthakar rozdaar khaanaa-pinaa kare
 After the sun rises, tenants cannot take sahari
 sahari kii hi tarah roje kaa doosraa ahm hissaa he iftaar
 After sahari, eating and drinking anything is prohibited till sunset
 suraj ast ho jane ke baad rojaa kholaa jaataa he, jise iftaar kehete hai
 During Ramadan one also has to keep the mind pure
 man main kisi ke liye bure khyaal nahin laane hote or paanch baar kii namaaz or quran padhi jaati he
 Some things have to be taken care of during the fast
 roje ko nibhaane ke liye kai niyam bhi hote hai
 - roze kaa matlab yah nahin he ki aap khaaen to kuch na, lekin khaane ke bare main sochate rahen
 One should not even think about eating during fasting
 islam ke anusaar paanch baaten karne par roza tutaa hua mana jaataa he
 These are five things - slander, greed, evil behind, lie and swear falsely
 roje kaa matlab bas us allaah ke naam par bhukhe-pyaase rahanaa hi nahin he
 During this, fasting of eyes, ears and tongue is also done
 is baat kaa matlab yah he ki na hi to is dauraan kuch bura dekhen, na bura sunen or na hi bura bolen
 The main law of Roja is that Muslims who keep Roja should not eat anything from sunrise to sunset
 roje ke dauraan aurat ke liye man main bure vichaar yaa shaareerik sambandhon ke bare main sochane par bhi manaahi hoti he
 Sahri is an important part of Rosé
 sahari kaa matlab hota he subah
 Roja's rule is to get up and drink daily before the sun comes out
 suraj ugane ke baad rozdaar sahari nahin le sakate
 Iftar, like Sahari, is another important part of Iftar
 sahari ke baad suryaast tak kuch bhi khaane-pine kii manaahi hoti he
 Rosa is opened after the sun sets, called iftar
 ramajaan ke dauraan man ko bhi shuddh rakhana hota he
 One does not have to bring bad thoughts to anyone in the mind and the five times Namaz and Quran are recited

 Modi 2
 0 sarkaar ke liye sansad main bhavy shuruyaat rahi
 In the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha, more than two dozen bills were introduced in the House and the government was able to pass most of them
 beete 15 saal main ye shuruaati or bajet satron main kisi bhi sarkaar kaa sabase acha pradarshan rahaa
 While the opposition has been alleging that the NDA government is forcing the House to pass the bills in any way
 aam chunaav main prachand jeet ke baad 17veen loksabhaa ke pehle satr main kaamkaaj kii raftaar ko bhi sarkaar jeet kii tarah le rahi he
 Data collected by India Today shows that the initial session has actually been a success for the government
 26 july tak modi sarkaar ne loksabhaa main 30 bill pesh kiye
 Of these, the House passed 20 bills
 jahaan tak donon sadanon kaa sawaal he to 14 bill paas hue
 After 2004, most of the bills have passed in the first or budget session of Lok Sabha
 piares lejislative kii ore se sankalit data ke mutabik saal 2004 main 14veen loksabhaa se lekar saal 2014 main 16veen loksabhaa tak pehle satron main koi vidhaayi kaamkaaj nahin hua
 In the year 2004, in the budget session which ran from July 5 to August 26, only 6 bills could be passed
 isi tarah saal 2009 main 15veen loksabhaa ke bajet satr (2 july se 7 agast) main mahaj 8 bill hi paas karaae ja sake
 In the budget session of the 16th Lok Sabha in 2014, only 12 bills could be passed between July 7 and August 14
 vahiin vipaksh kaa aarope he ki sarkaar jaldbaaji main bill patake rahi he or ye bina kisi chaanbin ke paas karaae ja rahe hai
 Even the NDA ally Janata Dal United has warned the government on this issue
 congress saansad pradeep bhattacharya ne kaha, ‘jis tareeke se sarkaar sadan main bill pesh kar rahi he or jis tarah unhen jaldbaaji main paas karaayaa ja rahaa he wo kisi ke hit main nahin he
 The kind of investigation that should be done on them is not being allowed to happen
 ’jediu pravaktaa kasee tyaagi ne bhi bilon ko jis tarah pesh kiya ja rahaa he, us par sawaal uthaaya
 Tyagi said, 'whether its UPA or NDA, their impartiality is questioned by the opposition
 sahi yahi he ki har party ko bill par vichaar karne kaa mauka mili
 As a Member of Parliament, my view is that if a bill wants to send a large number of mps to the committee within the stipulated time, then it should be done
 ’sarkaar ne vipaksh ke in aaropon ko khaarij kiya ki loksabhaa main bahumat hone kii vajah se sarkaar kii ore se bilon ko jaldbaaji main paas karaane kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 BJP MP Vinay Sahastrabuddhe told India Today, 'it is not correct to say that the bills are being bulldozed
 agar sadan chahta ho to ham hameshaa bilon ko cametiyon ko bhejne ke liye taiyaar hai
 But often there is no qualitative change in the bills being discussed in the House and the bills considered in the Select / Standing Committees
 ’vistaarit satr kii vajah se 7 agast tak or bilon ko pesh kiye jane kii puri sambhaavna he

 janemaane geetkaarajaved akhtarki najar main pyaar kaa na koi kaaran hota he na koi udeshy, bas mohabbat yun hi ho jaati he or jis din pyaar mohabbat kaa uddeshy or kaaran pataa lag gaya, us din pyaar, pyaar nahin rah jaayegaa
 According to Javed Akhtar, unless you respect someone, you cannot call him love, thoughts, needs, aspirations and respect are called love
 jisamen ye bate nahin hotin wo mohabbat nahin he
 Javed Akhtar, who came to Pink City Jaipur, did all this while explaining the definition of love
 unhone kaha ki jisaki vyakhya ho jaae vah pyaar nahin he kyonki pyaar kii koi paribhaasha nahin hoti, bas mohabbat yun hi kab, kahaan, kisase ho jaye koi nahin kah nahin saktaa

 Javed Akhtar said, love, no one can live without love, love happens here, that is why today there has never been any research on love, love, many years of love is going on, even in the coming centuries
 Love will continue because love is passion and nothing else
 unhone kaha laila- majanuun, siri-farhaad ne yadi vivaah kar liya hota to unhen aaj koi yaad nahin karata
 They did not forget that they only loved and did not marry
 javed akhtar ne kaha ki kabhi kabhi ham adhikaar ko pyaar samaj baithte he, jabaki yah pyaar nahin he, yaa yun kah sakate he ki aadat ko mohabbat samaj gayi he, hakeekat main yah keval aadat hi he, pyaar nahin
 Javed Akhtar said in his unique style, it is love and love that have kept the man alive
 meri najar main pyaar vah he jisamen imoshan he
 If there is no emotion then it is not love, i think it is something else

 Rahul Gandhi filed the nomination for the post of Congress President on December 11, 2017, with which he was considered the President of the party
 haalanki isaki ghoshnaa paanch din baad yani 16 disambar ko hui
 It was a coincidence for Rahul Gandhi, when exactly one year later, on December 11, 2018, the Congress won power by winning assembly elections in three states of the Hindi belt
 rahul gandhi jab congress ke itihaas main sabase lambey vakt tak adhyaksh raheen apni maa sonia gandhi se party kii kaman apane haathon main lee, tab mahaj chaar rajyon-karnataka, punjab, mizoram or pudducheri mencongresski sarkaar thi
 In front of him, the challenge was to rejuvenate the Congress organization, which was frustrated by the constant defeat
 yahi nahin, saamne pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii ajey jodi bhi thi
 The first challenge before Rahul Gandhi was the Gujarat Legislative Assembly after Modi became the sweat-bearer of the Gujarat election
 wo bakhubi jaanate the ki rajya main lagaataar haar se sanghathan kaa manobal dharaatal par he
 Along with this, he also understood the political message that came out of the results of this election in terms of being the homeland of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 rahul ne gujarat main lokapriy ho chale yuva brigade hardik patel, alpesh thakor or jignesh mewaani ko ek manch par laa diya
 Due to which the party got new energy
 iske saath hi rahul gandhi ne soft hindutv ko apana hathiyaar banaaya or jamkar mathon or mandiron main darshan kiye
 Though the Congress lost the election in Gujarat, the BJP was almost wiped out from the rural areas
 haar ke baavjood gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon se congress cader main yah sandesh jarur gaya ki pradhanmantri narendra modi aparaajey nahin he
 In Karnataka, after the losing bet, Gujarat elections were held in big states where Congress was in government
 karnataka ke chunaavon main janata ne khandit janadesh diya or bijepi sabase bada dal banakar ubhari
 But playing a big bet, Rahul announced his support by offering to make JD (S) HD Kumaraswamy as the Chief Minister
 haalanki rajyapal nebijepico sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya or aanan-fanan main bies yediurppa ko shapath bhi dilaa di
 But under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, the Congress was bent on reversing the losing bet
 maamla nyaayalay pahunchaa or der raat main congress kii taraf se rajyapal ke faisle ke khilaaf apil kii gai jisamen congress kii jeet hui
 Since the governor administered the oath to Yeddyurappa, he had to be given a chance to prove his majority
 lekin bahumat pareekshan ke din sankhyabal na hone ke kaaran yediurppa ne walk over de diya or is naatakeey ghatnakram ke baad congress-jedies sarkaar kaa rasta saaf ho gaya
 Rahul transformed this victory into a platform for the grand alliance to show strength in which top leaders of all non-nda parties participated
 modi ke chalanger ke taur par khud ko sthapit kiyakarnataka ke baad rahul gandhi ne khud ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ke chalanger ke taur par pesh kiya
 During the debate in the no confidence motion brought by the TDP in Parliament, he directly attacked PM Modi, weaponizing Rafael, demonetisation, GST, agrarian crisis and unemployment
 iske saath hi unhone aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon ko lekar endie main sendhamari bhi shuru kar di
 He succeeded in bringing the TDP, a major party of the NDA alliance, to his side
 hindi pattee ke rajyon main congress kii vapasisiton ke lihaaj se ahm uttar bharat ke rajyon se lagbhag saaf ho chuki congress ke saamne badi chunauti madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main vaapasi karne kii thi
 Rahul Gandhi united the divided Congress in these states to fight this challenge
 madhya pradesh main purv mukhyamantri digvijay singh ek ore parde ke peeche sakriy rahe to vahiin raajnneetik tikadamon ke maahir kamalnath ko pradesh sanghathan kii jimmedaari di gai
 At the same time, young face Jyotiraditya Scindia was given the command of the campaign
 kahana na hoga ki rahul kii ranneeti rang laai or aresas-bijepi ke kile main congress ke in diggajon ne apane-apane kshetra main behtareen nattejey die
 Rahul Gandhi worked very hard for the unexpected victory of the party which was almost leaderless in Chhattisgarh
 unhone nae sire se sanghathan khadaa kiya purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi or unke bete amit jogi ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya or jab sab maan kar chal rahe the ki jogi factor ke chalate congress ko nuksaan hoga or bijepi ek baar phir satta par kabiz ho jaaegi
 The Congress surprised everyone by securing a two-thirds majority
 rajasthan ke itihaas main ab tak ke nunatam str pahunch chuki congress ke saamne badi chunauti thi
 Rahul united veterans like Sachin Pilot, Ashok Gehlot, CP Joshi
 yahaan bhi congress ne pichley chunaav ke mukaable lagbhag paanch guna siten hasil karte hue satta main vaapasi kii
 Stalin told Rahul PM candidate MK Stalin, president of upa's ally DMK in Tamil Nadu, shocked everyone when he proposed Rahul Gandhi's name as Opposition PM candidate in view of Congress's success in three states The ability is that they can defeat the fascist BJP
 haalanki stallin ke is bayaan par tiemasi, samaajawaadee party ne sahmati nahin jataai or ensipi bhi pehle kah chuki he ki chunaav ke nateezon se pehle piem ke ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa na ho
 However, Sharad Pawar has also said that the PM will be the leader of the largest party after the election
 yahi nahin, teen rajyon ke parinaam congress adhyaksh ke taur rahul gandhi ko endie kii sahyogi dal shivasena kii bhi tarif mili
 Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray even went on to say that Rahul could only stand by his humility in the storm of Modi's arrogance
 baharhaal, raajnneeti main kuch bhi nishchit nahin hota
 The next Lok Sabha election is a final, so the Congress is upbeat with a win in the semi-finals
 lihaaja congress adhyaksh ke taur par rahul gandhi ke ek saal ko bemisaal to kaha hi ja saktaa he
 GS Damore of BJP, who won the election from jhabua-ratlam Lok Sabha seat, will continue to be MP
 unhone vidhayak pad se istipha dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Damore was an MLA from Jhabua seat
 unke is elaan ke saath hi madhyapradesh main ab jhabua vidhansabha seat par up chunaav hona tay he
 Damore first defeated Vikrant Bhuria in the Assembly, then his father Congress veteran Kantilal Bhuria in the Lok Sabha
 ab madhyapradesh kii jhabua vidhansabha seat par up chunaav hoga kyonki bijepi ne faisla kiya he ki is seat se chune gaye jies damor dilli kaa rukh karenge, bhopal se vidaa honge
 Madhya Pradesh BJP President Rakesh Singh said that GS Damore will resign from the membership of the assembly, will remain an MP
 damor ke loksabhaa chunaav jitate hi yahaan upachunaav kii sthiti ban gai thi
 Damore is the MLA from Jhabua and was then elected as an MP
 niyam ke mutabik aise halaat main chunaav jeetne ke 14 din ke bheetar ek seat chhodana hoti he
 The Congress feels that now it will increase one more MLA
 congress pravaktaa narendra saluja kaa kahana he ki 'nishchit taur par congress kii puri taiyaari he
 Will win by an overwhelming majority in this by-election, as this by-election is on the job of the state government
 chaahe karjamaafee ho yaa adivasee varg kii bhalaai kii baat karen, yuvaaon ke rojgaar kii baat karen, iskaa phayda hamen milegaa
 Discussion on this seat is necessary for political arithmetic in the state as the BJP has 303 mps in the Lok Sabha elections
 jabaki 230 seat vaali vidhansabha main bijepi ke 109 vidhayak the, ab 108 hai
 The Congress has 114 mlas
 philhal chaar nirdaleey, do basapa va ek sapa vidhayak ke saath uske paas 121 kaa aankada he
 That is, if the BJP now moves to form a government in the state, then it needs seven to eight mlas
 haalanki bijepi ab bhi kah rahi he ki vah sarkaar nahin giraayegi
 BJP state president Rakesh Singh said, 'despite you guessing, we are very relaxed, in the Madhya Pradesh assembly
 sarkaar giraane kii baat hamane kabhi nahin kii, aaj bhi vahi kah rahe hai
 The Congress government is engaged in transfers, will fall from self-contradiction, we have no intention of toppling it
 'jhabua-ratlam seat rajya main congress kaa teesraa garh maani jaati he
 But in the 2014 elections, Dilip Singh Bhuria of BJP defeated Kantilal Bhuria of Congress
 dilip singh ke nidhan ke baad upachunaav hue to kantilal phir saansad ban gaye
 Now it will not be very easy for BJP to win Jhabua Assembly because it does not have many options on this seat
 da indian express kii is report ke mutabik amit shah ne kaha, 'congress kisi ek vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par, kisi ek siddhant ke aadhaar par bani hui party hi nahin he, wo aazaadee praapt karne kaa ek special purpaj whical he, aazaadee praapt karne kaa ek saadhan tha
 And that's why Mahatma Gandhi, with far-sightedness, was a very clever baniya, he knew what was going to happen, he said immediately after independence, Congress should be scattered
 mahatma gandhi ne nahin kiya, lekin ab kuch log usko bikherne kaa kaam samaapt rahe hai
 That is why Mahatma Gandhi said, because the Congress had no ideology, it was not a party based on principles
 desh chalaane ke, sarkaar chalaane ke koi siddhant hi nahin the
 ' iske ulat bijepi ke bare main bolte hue unhone kaha ki bhaajapa siddhanton par aadhaarit party he
 Because of the 'clearness of ideas', the party's view on important issues is very clear
 unhone kaha, ''

 '' ek kaarykram main bolne ke dauraan unhone yah bhi kaha ki desh kii 1650 partiyon main se keval bijepi or communist makapa hi he jinke bheetar aantarik loktantr he
 He said that everyone knows that when Sonia Gandhi steps down from the post of Congress President, Rahul Gandhi will be the President but no one can say about the BJP who will be the next Party President

 According to him, teenagers need nine hours of sleep and if they sleep only for seven hours, they sleep 10 hours less by the end of the week

 All people are now waiting for which formula the government will accept under this demand
 sabhi adhikariyon ko ab is baat kaa besabri se intjaar he
 In such a situation, many officials say that in the event of increasing the minimum wage, it will have an effect in the pay scale of all classes from bottom to top
 kuch adhikari yah ummid lagaae baithe hai ki ho saktaa he ki isse vetan ayog kii siforeeshon se zyada badhotaree ho jaae
 In the event of this happening, the government will have to make a lot of fund to pay salaries to the central employees and this will put additional burden on the government
 vahiin, kuch anya adhikariyon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki sarkaar nunatam vetanman badaye jane kii sthiti main koi aisa rasta nikaal laae jisase sarkaar par vetan dene ko lekar kuch kam boj pade
 Some people say that the government will directly implement two or three increments without increasing the minimum pay scale, which will increase the minimum wage itself and a way for the government to pay less to the lower class employees at a lower cost

 sawaal uthta he ki kya hadtaal par jane kii dhamkee dene vaale karmchaaree sanghathan or netaa kis baat ko sweekaar karenge
 At the same time, some other officials also believe that in the event of increasing the minimum pay scale, the government should come out with a way that will reduce the burden on the government
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar nunatam vetanman main zyada badhotaree na karte hue do-yaa teen inkrement sidhe lagu kar degi jisase nunatam vetan apane aap main bad jayega or sarkaar ko neeche kii shrenee ke karmchaariyon ko hi zyada vetan dekar kam kharche main ek rasta mil jayega
 The question arises as to what the workers' organizations and leaders who threaten to go on strike will accept
 Bringin a Bangladeshi actor to campaign for an Indian election is the proof for the fact- how much Bangladeshi infiltration @mamataofficial has aided just for hr vote bank 
 Looks like she clearly did not expect any support frm Indian Muslims so she had to import thm frm Bangladesh Bollywood producer Ashoke Pandit wrote: "bringing Bangladeshi actor to campaign in Indian elections proves that Mamata Banerjee (mamata Banerjee) just how many Bangladeshi infiltration help Bangladeshi infiltration for their vote bank
 aisa lagata he jaise unhen bhartiya musalamaanon se samarthan kii ummid nahin he, isliye wo bangladesh se laa rahi hai
 "ashok Pandit thus targeted West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee
 ashok pandit kaa yah twit viral ho rahaa he
 Ashoke Pandit also made many tweets earlier, which were in the headlines
 beete mangalvaar ko unhone kanhaiya kumaar par bhi jamkar hamalaa kar unhen aatankwaadi bataa diya tha or kaha tha ki wo desh ke tukade-tukade karnaa chahta he
 Even before this, he had targeted many Congress leaders
 bataa den ki ashok pandit 'da accidental prime ministar (the Accidental Prime Minister)' ke ko-produsar hai, or ve soshal media par kaaphi active bhi hai
 On September 15, two National Security Intelligence Agency (NIA) activists Hilal Amin and Aamir Abbas were involved in solving the mystery of the e-mail that came after the September 7 terror attack on the Delhi High Court
 inhen donon ne kishtwar ke do schuli chaatro aabid hossain or shaarik ahamed ko mail bhejne ke liye apana mohara banaaya tha
 Now it remains to be seen when the NIA who catches the message senders' neck can catch the real hands of the bomber
 or kya enie indian mujahidin naam ke us aatanki saaye kaa koi cheharaa saamne laa paaegi jo tamaam giraftaareyon ke baavjood ek ke baad ek aatanki dhamaake karata ja rahaa he
 The terrorist attack is the work of the terrorist network which has already established itself in the country, the Home Minister p Chidambaram himself has accepted this
 is desi aatankwaadi network ko khufia agenciyaan kareeb chaar saal se indian mujahidin kaa naam detii rahi hai or 2008 main iske tamaam kathith sarganaon kii giraftaar ke baad maahaul bana ki iem kii qamar tut gai he
 But the recent attacks in Mumbai and Delhi showed that this genie named IM had never been in the bottle
 iem pehle se zyada sangathit or taqatvar he
 It is different that no one has the right picture of this shadow of terror
 ulate kai maamle to aise saamne aae hai jinamein aarope lage ki begunaah ladakon ko uthaakar police ne unke upar iem kaa label chaspaan kar diya
 Surrounding theorists and arrest-absconding sources around IM, India Today tried to find out if the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) in 2008 and im's Safdar Nagauri, Abu Bashar Kashmi, Kayamuddin Kapadia and More than a dozen dons, including Mansoor Pirbhoy, were arrested by the police and Riyaz Bhatkal, Yasin Bhatkal, Aamir Raza Khan, Abdul Subhan Qureshi, Shadab Malik And Mohsin Chaudhary managed such vicious escape to Pakistan, now has the reins of which IM in the country and what is their new strategy
 khufia agenciyon kaa daawa he ki sitambar 2001 main jab pehali baar simi par pratibandh laga to uske kattarpanthi dhade ke kai sadasyon ne harakat-ul-jihad-e-islamic (huji) or uttar pradesh ke kuch yuvakon ke saath milakar iem bana liya, jise lashkar-e-taiyaba kii saraparasti hasil he
 But after the arrests of active members of SIMI-IM after the 2008 Mumbai blasts, IM was significantly weakened, but now it is raising its head again
 ibi ke purv pramukh e
 K
 dovel kehete hai, ''yah galatfahami he ki 2008 main iem ke zyaadaatar log giraftaar ho gaye
 Actually, more people are absconding than those arrested
 khufia agenciyon kii sakhti ke baavjood pakistan bhaag gaye aatankwaadi na sirf apane bhartiya modul ke sampark main hai, balki chori chhipe alag-alag raaston se bharat aate bhi rahete hai
 This claim is confirmed by the arrest of Syed Salauddin Salar, a former SIMI president, on 26 June this year
 salaar ko madhya pradesh aties ne kochi airport se us vakt giraftaar kiya, jab vah dubri kii flite se yahaan utraa
 He had been looking for a case of communal tension for a long time
 isi saal 5 june ko hui ikraar shaikh kii giraftaar se bhi is baat kaa khulaasa hua ki bharat kaa aatankwaadi modul pakistan main chhipe aatankwaadiyon ke sampark main he
 Iqrar Sheikh is said to be the prime accused in the Ahmedabad blast
 peshey se chemical ejeeniyar shaikh visphotak saamagree banane kaa visheshgy he or iem ke sargana abdul subhaan kuraishi kaa daayan haath he jise mumbai kii local trainon main hue visphot or ahmedabad, dilli tathaa bangaloru main hue visphoton kaa 'dimag' mana jaataa he
 In May and June this year, the first thing in questioning some terrorists who were caught by the police was that the terrorists who fled to Pakistan are staying there and working for India's terrorist network
 duusari baat yah ki 2008 ke mumbai dhamaakon ke baad se khamosh najar aa rahe iem ne is dauraan desh main sleeper cells kaa bada jaal desh main failaayaa he
 Intelligence agencies have received information about 106 sleeper cells and about 400 IM members active in the country so far this year
 madhya pradesh aties ne ek kadam aage badhate hue aise 5 maamalon kaa khulaasa kiya he, jinamein funding ke liye aatankwaadiyon ne dakaiti kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 The terrorists arrested in Ratlam, Jabalpur and Bhopal of the state said that in the last two years they have paid Rs
 12 lakh from the banks of Pipalia Mandi and Javra in Dewas, Itarsi and Mandsaur districts

 He raised Rs 2 crore from Manappuram Gold Finance Company in Bhopal in August 2010

 25 karod ru
 Gold jewelery was also recovered
 aisa nahin he ki chori-dakaiti hi funding kaa akelaa tarika bachaa ho, dovel kii maane to aatankwaadiyon ko videshi sanghathanon se bhi paisa milane kaa shaq he
 These include several organizations in Saudi Arabia, the International Brotherhood, the World Assembly of Muslim Youths, Al Jamaiya of Indonesia, Morocco and some organizations in the Philippines
 vahiin khadi deshon main based bharatiyon ke jariye bhi aatankwaadiyon tak paisa pahunch rahaa he
 That is, IM is in touch with the international network of terrorism
 aatank ke modul main nae aatankwaadiyon ko shaamil karne kaa kaam bhi ab bahut saavdhaanee se ho rahaa he
 Ajay Sahni, executive director of the Institute for Conflict Management, says that it is now difficult to recruit terrorists through a mosque debate
 ab aise logon ko chhanta ja rahaa he, jinka khun musalamaanon par ho rahe kathith atyaacharon par kuch jaldi hi khulata ho
 In a period of a few months to a few years, such youths are involved in IM and are skilled in every way to carry out terrorist acts
 inamen ucch shiksha praapt log bhi hai
 The latest example of terrorist recruitment and network has come in the revelations of Madhya Pradesh ATS
 police ke mutabik is saal june main giraftaar aatankwaadiyon kaa infarmeshan technology main acha-khaasaa dakhal he
 They are all young and identify themselves only as students
 inke paas se sidi, pen drive, driving license or kai farji dastavej mili
 a terrorist named Zakir, who was caught from Ratlam, even got a fake UID card in the name of Sadiq
 in dastavejon kii maujuudagi main inhen nae sim card kharidne main bhi koi dikkat pesh nahin aati thi
 The Gujarat ATS arrested a terrorist in Ahmedabad in connection with the July 2011 Mumbai bombings
 uski nishandehi par uttar pradesh ke mahoba jile ke raath kasbe se ek sandigdh ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 Rath's name has never been linked to terrorist acts before
 iem ne aise kasbe main apana network pahunchaa diya jahaan rail network bhi nahin he
 The Mumbai blasts are also said to be related to Itarsi in Madhya Pradesh
 aatankwaadi network cancer kii tarah kaise fail rahaa he, iskaa khulaasa is saal 5 june ko madhya pradesh aties kii 8 aatankwaadiyon kii giraftaar se bhi hua
 Among the arrested terrorists are 5 SIMI members and three members of the Indian Mujahideen, including Iqrar Sheikh and Abu Faizal
 aties ke mutabik faijal ne sweekaar kiya ki uske rishte riyaj bhatkal or ejaj bhatkal se hai
 Terrorists have also changed the ways of communication among themselves amid tightening clutches of the police
 saahani kehete hai ki inkryptid massej, tasviir main chhipe sandesh or yahaan tak ki pornographic (ashleel) saamagree ke jariye bhi aatankwaadi gupt samvaad kar rahe hai
 The intention behind sending pornographic material is that these agencies will not take them seriously
 institute for dephence studies and analysis (idise) main iem par shodh kar rahi senior phelo namrata goswami kahati hai, ''human courier is samay aatankwaadiyon kaa sabase bharosemand hathiyaar he
 a man came quietly and met someone and went away
 iskaa koi record kahin nahin rahata
 This is the way terrorists are adopting important messages and planning
 '' is kaam main mahilaon ko bhi lagaaya gaya he
 Significantly, Osama bin Laden, who was killed by American agencies in Pakistan, was using a courier
 lekin iem ke majboot hone kii ek duusari vajah ko bhi nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This is the reason for the arrest of all those people who are involved in terrorism
 aatank ke garh ke rup main badnaam ho chuke uttar pradesh ke azamgarh kasbe se aatankwaad ke silsile main pichley paanch saal main 14 pramukh aatankiyon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Pointing fingers at many of these people, the joint secretary of the Uttar Pradesh unit of the People's Union for Civil Liberty (PUCL), Christuddin Sanjari, said, "the court will decide the crime but in many arrests the facts were distorted
 2008 ahmedabad bam dhamaakon ke master mind bataae ja rahe abu bashar ko 14 agast ko police ne azamgarh se uthaaya lekin uski giraftaar 16 agast, 2008 ko lakhanu se dikhaai gai
 In this case, before August 16, a fax was filed to the Supreme Court to raise Bashar from Azamgarh
 yah fax supreme court ke record main he
 He said that similar disturbances have been observed in the arrests of doctors Tariq Kasami and Khalid Mujahid, accused of the Lucknow and Faizabad blasts and Mohammad Sarwar, arrested in connection with the Jaipur blasts
 yahi nahin india today ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik azamgarh ke nau yuva lambey samay se faraar bhi hai
 Some of these have up to 52 cases filed
 sthaneey police ko inke bare main koi suraag nahin he or unke parijan kehete hai ki unke bachche gaayab hai
 Such matters are further complicating rather than clearing the face of im's organization
 haalanki dovel kaa maananaa he aatankwaadi maamalon main khufia agenciyaan bahut ehtiyaat baratati hai or galat vyakti ko uthaane kii ghatana naa ke baraabar hi hogi
 Pakistan is also taking some such precaution, but its purpose is something else
 paak nahin chahta ki aatank kii bisaat par sidhe-sidhe uskaa koi mohara pit jaae or america kii panchayat main uskaa vajeer safai detaa phire
 On Pakistan's dual policy of spraying oil from behind the scenes in a furnace of terror, Sahni says, "for three-four years, international pressure on Pakistan has increased
 aise main iesai pehle kii tarah aatankwaadiyon ko hathiyaar or gola-barood nahin de paa rahi he
 This is the reason that most of the explosions in India in the last few years were of low intensity and used readily available ammonium nitrate instead of RDX
 aatankwaadiyon ko saamaanya taur par ardex pakistani sena se miltaa rahaa he, lekin mumbai par 2008 main hue hamale ke baad se paak sena duuri banaati hui dikhnaa chaahati he
 Therefore, he wants to strengthen IM in such a way that it looks like an Indian terrorist organization
 '' haalanki mumbai or dilli par hue taaja hamalon main piitien visphotak istemaal hua jo aam taur par sena ke paas hota he
 This fact indicates a change in the strategy of the Pak Army
 bade dhamaake kar iem ne yah sabit nahin kiya ki intelligence agenciyaan dhang se kaam nahin kar paa rahi hai yaa phir unke paas sansadhano kii kami he? is bare main saahani kehete hai, ''jitne chote kasbon main jaakar aatankwaadi apana network failaa rahe hai, kya vaaki us str tak nigaraanee karne ke liye hamaare paas khufia adhikari hai? sara khufia tantra mila liya jaae to desh main field intelligence ke liye bamushkil 15,000 adhikari honge
 As such, intelligence agencies have many responsibilities besides terrorism
 inamen rajnatik, aarthik or aapraadhik khufiagiri bhi shaamil he
 "loni police station adjacent to Delhi has only three policemen to gather intelligence on the population of 1
5 million
" dovel kii maane to desh main khufia adhikariyon kii sankhya kam nahin he, lekin aatankwaad par najar rakhana vaaki unki pehali praathamikta he, is baat ko lekar kai sawaal hai
 They even believe that since the POTA is over, the police are not able to strictly interrogate the terrorists
 lekin asal baat yah he ki desh main ek ke baad ek badi aatankwaadi vaardaat ho rahi hai or log khud ko asurakshit mahasoos kar rahe hai
 a mysterious organization called IM, whose head no one knows with a claim, is laying a landmine of sleeper cells in the countryside, which is successful in digging and sometimes scorching the security agencies
 Go
 aise main sawaal yah he ki kya sarkaar khufia tantra ko itnaa majboot karegi ki aatankavriksh kii jadon main mattha daalaa ja sake yaa phir sarkari soch mudrasphiti ke hisaab se maut kaa muaavja badhaane tak hi simit he
 The CBI may not have knocked on the former railway minister's door yet, but the recording of his nephew's phone calls is constantly bringing the investigating agency closer to him
 darasal, mahesh kumaar se rishwat kii rakam tay karne ke liye vijay singla lagaataar is baat par jor de rahaa tha ki 10 karod se kam kii rakam par mamaa naaraaz ho jaaenge
 The CBI wants to pave the way for interrogation of Pawan Bansal through phone records of Vijay Singla and Mahesh Kumar and notings recorded in files
