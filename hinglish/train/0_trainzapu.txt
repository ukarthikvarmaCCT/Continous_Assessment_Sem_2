 In his three-year tenure, Shah has doubled the number of states in the party to 18 and the party contested a total of 15 elections, of which nine won

 Asked if this new party would be merely an election machine that could swallow the bjp's original identity of being a party associated with the ideology, Shah replied, "this emerging BJP will be invincible in electoral politics
" yah mashin nahin, balki raashtra nirmaan kaa mishan he

 Shah's challenge is to set up an all-india party, which can lead to another such victory
 us party ko jo bhimkaay hote hue bhi furtili he, paaramparik hote hue bhi aadhunik he
 Cultivating these contradictions can be a difficult task, and Shah's success recipe for this, which he exposes during his torrid tours, will strengthen the Harru party from the very bottom, expanding its areas of strength

 in teen manishiyon ke dharm, shashankala or vicharadhara ke sabak ve party kaa punarniman karne main utaarne kii koshish karte hai
 Building the next generation of leaders is one of Shah's biggest priorities
 yah vah kaam bhi he jisase unhen sabase zyada prerana or takat milti he
 He repeatedly emphasizes how the BJP is the only national party in which even a booth-level worker can dream of becoming the party's president
 uttar pradesh ke chunaavon main rajya bhaajapa main nai peedi ke netaaon kii ek nai paudh ubharkar ai
 Shah went against the stream and supported Yogi Adityanath for the chief minister's chair
 party ke sutara kehete hai ki shah ne bhavishya ke netaaon ke taur par takreeban 270 netaaon kii pahchaan kii he, jo sabhi 40 se kam umr ke hai
 They have not allowed anyone to even know about these names
 is fehrist ko badhaakar ve 400 naamon se upar le janaa chaahate hai
 Shah often talks with important officials of the state and divides each state region-wise
 harek rajya kaa ek pramukh netaa shah ke bheje sawaalon ke aadhaar par vistrut vishleshan pesh karata he
 At the end of the 90-minute meeting, Shah assesses what changes are necessary
 ye khuli baithken ve puure dabadabe or khulepan ke saath sanchalit karte hai
 With the approval of the appointing officer for the hanging work like the appointment of office bearers in the party organization, they set the deadline and then threaten to take action in the event of non-implementation
 bataur party adhyaksh kaman sanbhaalane ke baad shah ne jo 10 project shuru kiye the, unamem party ko bilkul nichle str se nae sire se khadaa karnaa bhi tha
 The first phase was to create offices in all 670 party districts
 2014 main sirf 114 jila ikaayiyon ke paas apane daftar the
 Today 30 new district offices are ready and 388 works are in progress
 harek rajya or jila mukhyalayon par rajkaaj, bhartiya itihaas, us rajya yaa jile or samvidhan par kitabon kii librari banane ke product hai
 Arvind Menon, in charge of the party's departments and projects, and a team of Malviya, convenor of the IT department, accompany Shah on state visits and take stock of the progress of all projects
 2019 ke liye ek ahm chunavi ranneeti 3,75,000 vistaarakon kii ek fouj ko maidan main utaarna he
 These will be part-time voluntary workers who will give their 15 days till the general elections to strengthen the booths for the sake of the party
 iske alaava loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle party kii sambhaavnaaon main chaar chand lagane ke liye chaar hajaar vistaarakon kii ek alag fouj ko is saal may se desh bhar main nishchit vidhansabha kshetra saunp gaye hai
 Shah has introduced work-based training for treasurers, party spokespersons and elected representatives of local elected bodies
 party ke rashtriya mahasachiv muralidhar raav kehete hai, ''yah prashikshan philhal jitne bade paimaane par or jis raftaar se chal rahaa he, vah abhootpurv he
 "in the new political work culture of Shah, 10 lakh workers have been trained in certain tasks at all levels
 is prashikshan dhaanche ke teen str hai—mandal str ke kaaryakartaaon ko 24 ghante sanghathan kaa prashikshan jiske tahat dedh saal main 7,500 shivi lagaae ja chuke hai, jila str ke kaaryakartaaon ke liye do din kaa shivi or rajya str ke party kaaryakartaaon ke liye teen din ke shivi
 Member of Training Committee r
 balashankar ke mutabik vichaardhaara, party kaa itihaas or lakshya, aarthik niti, media ke saath rishte or party tathaa sarkaar ke bich talmail prashikshan paathyakram ke hisse hai
 Not only this, Shah wants his party workers to have the means to move around and stay connected
 ek baithak main unhone haath uthwaae ki 139 main se kitne party vistaarakon ke paas smartphone or motorcycilen hai
 He then instructed local party leaders to fulfill the need
 shah kaa mansuba party ko is tarah taiyaar or prashikshit karne kaa he ki mahagathbandhan or anti-inakambency sareekhe khataron kaa koi matlab hi na bache, khaskar unki booth management ranneeti ke dhaave ke khilaaf
 The growth caused by their clever alliance is worth noting
 modi or shah ke hunar kii badaulat raashtrapati chunaav main 44 partiyon ne ramnath kovind kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Earlier, 33 parties attended a NDA meeting led by Shah
 ve kehete hai, ''agar aap is mantra par chalem to aapako apni niyati ke alaava kisi se darana nahin padegaa
 Whatever alliance or anti-incumbency, you will win by a stunning margin
 ''kaam sanbhaalane ke baad jaldi hi shah ne 19 nae mahakme banaae, unhen kaam kaa charter saunpa or lakshya tay kiye
 This work was done earlier, but only when needed
 ab chunaav prabandhan ke liye mahakama he, to chunaav ayog ke saath talmail ke liye bhi mahakama he
 There is a separate department to handle social media which has dramatically improved and enhanced bjp's outreach
 phir centre sarkaar ke saath party ke talmail ke liye mahakama he, to nitiyon par research ke liye bhi mahakama he
 For example, the party's Swachh Bharat program requests party workers to participate in cleanliness campaigns
 mahasachiv bhupendra yadav kehete hai, ''amitbhai ne bhaajapa ko vichaardhaara kii ek nai dhar di he
 If the PM is aiming for a new India, then Amitabhai is looking at a new BJP that can match his vision
 ve jo kayakalp kar rahe hai usamen party ke kaam karne ke tareeke main sudhaar or paardarshita se lekar party kaa khoobiyon se bharaa vikaas or sthaayee buniyadi dhaancha khadaa karne tak sabhi chijen shaamil hai
 Nevertheless, Shah has some problems ahead of his general election strategy
 party main sabase adhik chintaa dhimi aarthik vrudghi, rojgaar kaa sankat or asangathit kshetra par notebandi tathaa jiesti ke asar ko lekar he
 There is also dissatisfaction in the BJP with the reception of leaders of other political parties
 party ke varisht netaaon kaa ek varg bhi alag-thalag mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Apart from this, Shah has not been able to form a whole team of office bearers during his three-year tenure as president
 isse unhen unheen padaadhikariyon par nirbhar rahanaa pad rahaa he, jinke kaam se ve santusht nahin bhi hai
 According to an expert, Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are also not expected to get big electoral gains
 aise main jeet kaa daur gadabadaya to kisi ke maththe thikra nahin phutegaa, isse shah waakif hai

 The Civil Line Police Police in Prayagraj has arrested a thug who started 'recovery' in the name of a woman minister of Yogi Sarkar
 police ke shikanje main aate hi mastermind thag khud ko kathith 'netaa' bataane laga
 In this connection, a criminal case was registered on Saturday on the complaint of the secretary of the woman minister
 giraftaar aaropee kaa naam ashok kumaar pandeya (40) bataaya gaya he
 Prayagraj Senior Superintendent of Police Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said that the thug is being interrogated for custody

 internet kii duniya aapke majahabi yakeenon kii parvaah nahin karti
 But now such a search engine has been created, which will search according to the rules of Islam
 http: / / halalgoogling
 This search engine named com has been designed in such a way that it brings the same results which do not contain haram content according to Islam
 pichley dinon is search ingine kii shuruyaat pakistan main kii gai
 Designed for the use of Muslims, this search engine works only with the help of search engines like Google and Bing
 darasal jaise hi aap halaalagugling main koi shabd khojate hai
 It takes results from search engines like Google and then passes them through its filter system
 ye ek software he, jisamen islam ke mutabik jo bhi cites, chijen, shabd or vyakhyaayein haraam hai, unhen rigelt se baahar kar detaa he
 In such a situation, the user of halalgoogleing gets only Halal content
 halaalagugling ke jariye porn site nahin dekhi ja sakati
 Apart from this, no search can be done about homosexuals
 islam main jua khilne ko bhi haraam mana jaataa he
 Therefore, any site related to gambling or betting cannot be searched through halalgoogling
 is site kaa daawa he ki uske haraam filtiring system ko chaar chizon ne khaas banaaya he
 It has a general category filtering, which filters the content so that the haram material can be removed
 doosraa pahalu he varjit cites kaa
 Never come to such sites in search results, in which dirty things are shown, a blacklist has been made for such websites
 phir link filtering ke liye bhi ek step rakhaa gaya he
 So that if there is any link or page in any search site, then it should be removed and the rest of the content is displayed
 or aakhir main he iskaa killer feechar
 Identifying the words of the haram
 do tareeke hai iske oparation ke
 First, there should not be a search for haraam words
 doosraa, agar search ho bhi, to puure web ke rigelt disple hi na kiye jaaen
 But is the site really a correct claim, it is a matter of theory
 ab practical najaara
 If porn on halalgoogling, playboy
 mohammad kii tasviir yaa jijas kaa purnjanm, is tarah kii chizon ko search karenge, to screen par ek hi massej chamakegaa
 No result or else you have discovered haraam material
 magar site daal daal he, to yujar paat paat
 Some people showed an article through this search to blow the flag of the website
 isamen ket naam kii ek model ek ghode ke upar lagbhag nagn andaaj main baithi thi
 After this the site's convenors clarified that 'we are doing our best
 magar abhi tak search ingine ko puri tarah se haraam pruf nahin banaaya ja saktaa he
 Much remains to be done
 allaah kii ichha or aapaki madad se ham aisa kar paaenge
 'site makers are sure that one day this search engine will work for every Muslim siblings
 site ke blog par likhaa gaya he ki agar search ke dauraan kuch galat nattejey aa jaaen to hamen maaf kar den
 We are also human beings and Allah alone does not make mistakes

 The Aam Aadmi Party released its manifesto on Saturday, in which 70 kinds of announcements were made, including halving the electricity rates and providing free water
 khaas baat jis par meri najar gai wo yah ki party ne vaade nibhaane kii koi dedline tay nahin kii
 For example, in the last elections, the party had announced that the Lokpal bill would be passed in Ramlila Maidan within 15 days of the formation of the government or in a year
 lekin pehle to sarkaar let bani or phir bill let aayaa
 What would have happened if the Lokpal bill passed, could not be kept in the Assembly and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal resigned from the government
 yahi nahin, dilli lokapal bill par centre kii upie sarkaar or dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar main aisi thani ki centre sarkaar ne kaha ki pehle bill centre ko bhejie or manjuuri lekar hi vidhansabha main rakhie, lekin kejariwal sarkaar ad gai or bina manjuuri ke hi bill vidhansabha main pesh karne kii koshish kii
 The bill could not be introduced in the House and Kejriwal resigned
 is baar agar aam aadmi party satta main ai to kya karegi or kaise karegi? kyonki menifesto main 'aap' kaa pehla vaada lokapal kaa he, lekin is baar party ne is par koi dedline nahin di he
 When asked on the issue, the head of the aap's Manifesto Committee, he said that this time we do not want to dispute unnecessarily by giving deadline, because suppose that if the work is not done in 15 days, then unnecessary The problem occurs and pressure builds up
 
 
 ham saare kaam jald se jald karne kii koshish karenge
 
 
 You can say that we are new and learning from our mistakes

 BSP president Mayawati on Saturday targeted organizations like Bhima Army and said that they are playing at the behest of BJP
 unhone kaha ki basapa ko maaloom chalaa he ki bhim army, bahujan youth for mishan 2019- agali pradhanmantri bahan ji jaise sanghathan hamaare vipaksh dwaara parde ke peeche se chalaae ja rahe hai
 Mayawati said that those who are running anti-bsp organizations are telling our innocent people living in Dalit colonies that they will make Behenji the Prime Minister
 bataa den ki basapa se nishkasit kiye gaye party upaadhyaksh rahe jai prakaash in dinon mayawati ko piem banane liye bahujan youth for mishan 2019 ke tahat rath lekar upi main daura kar rahe hai
 Mayawati said, 'organizations like Bhima Army are tricking innocent people
 ye basapa ke badhate andolan par aise sanghathan roda he
 BSP is a party of all religions and castes
 vahiin bhim army jaise sanghathan vyaktigat swaarth ke liye bane hai
 People running such organizations are asking people to run their business and gather people in their programs
 yahi nahin ye sanghathan logon se kah rahe hai ki vah keval basapa or bahanji ko majboot banane ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 He is playing with people's feelings and collecting funds from them and making personal use of them
 mayawati ne kaha ki is tarah ke sanghathan na keval apni or vipaksh kii swaarthee jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye aisa karte hai balki vah hamaare nirdosh logon ko oonchi jati ke khilaaf uksaate hai or nafrat failaane kaa kaam karte hai
 Targeting the BJP government on the Ayodhya issue, Mayawati said, 'the BJP government at the Center is going to complete five years
 kuch maheenon baad aam chunaav hone vaale hai, aise main bijepi khaastaur se narendra modi ne 2014 main logon se kiye gaye 50 pratishat vaade bhi puure nahin kiye hai
 The BJP and PM know this
 unhen yah mahasoos ho gaya he ki vah satta main waapas nahin aaenge
 Attacking the central government on the pretext of the Ram temple, Mayawati said that she was taking up the Ram temple case to divert attention from her failures
 unhone kaha ki agar unki bhavanaaen acchhee hoti to unhen ram mandir ke liye paanch saal tak intjaar nahin karnaa padataa
 This is his political strategy and nothing else
 bijepi ke sahyogi shivasena or vishwa hindu parishad jo bhi kar rahe hai vah ek raajnneetik sajeesh kaa hissaa he

 On the 25th of April, Judge Madhusudan Sharma in Jodhpur Jail sentenced Swayambhu Baba Asaram to life imprisonment when his face went down
 kabhi hajaaron shraddhaluon par jaadu chalaane vaale asaram kii sari tikadamen adaalat ke saamne bekaar gayi
 The judge, while sentencing Asaram on the charge of raping a minor girl in August 2013, remarked, "the convict not only broke the trust of the victim but also damaged the image of saints in the general public
 ''lekin asaram jaise akut takat ke maalik se laduya itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 The judge himself also referred to the courage of the victim
 peedita asaram ke vishaal kad or takat se ghabaraai hui thi par abhibhavakon kaa saath paakar usne himmat dikhaai or use is anjaam tak pahunchaaya
 With this, the stigma of this malicious Baba who made headlines for the crimes got repulsed
 asaram baapu kaa ubharna, phalnaa-phoolnaa or phir uskaa patan haal ke dashakon kii sabase haroonges kahaniyon main shumaar he
 Asaram's ascension and a refugee boy from Birani village of Nawabshah area in Pathansindh province reached Kutch and then Ahmedabad after partition
 shuruyaat main usne cycle kii dukaan main marammat se lekar tangevaale tak kai kaam kiye or aakhirkaar kathavachak banane kaa rasta chunakar apane jabardast anuyaayi banaae or phir ek din dhadaam se jameen par aa gira
 It is like an incredible story
 vah ladkaa or koi nahin balki asumal thoumal harplani tha, jisane baad main apana naam asaram rakh liya
 After coming from Kutch, Asaram lived in the Maninagar area of ahmedabad, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader of the same area (who has passed away) once told India Today that Asaram, during his youth, He had also tried to get involved in RSS branches, but due to his autistic ways, he was soon shown the way out
 asaram ko kuccha ke dinon se jaanane vaale uske ek dost ke mutabik, usne kishor umr main kuccha ke bade sindhi sant lila shah baba kaa anuyaayi banane kii bhi koshish kii thi, par uske ziddee or manamaujee rang-dhang ko dekhte hue sant ne use kabhi sweekaar nahin kiya
 But the truth was never revealed publicly that Lilashah Baba had rejected Asumal
 jaldi hi asumal ne apana nayaa naam asaram baapu rakhkar sanyasi kaa safed chola dhaaran kar liya or sant banane kii raah par chal padaa
 People started gathering around him, mostly Sindhis in the beginning
 jaldi hi jab vah bhagwaan krishna or bhagwaan shiv or khud apane guru puja ke naam par nichle tabakon ke avsaad se grast logon kii takalifon kaa nivaaran karne kaa daawa karne laga, to har tarah ke log uske anuyaayiyon kii jamaat main shaamil hone lage
 He used many tricks to impress those who came near him
 asaram ke anuyaayi ek baat ke liye jane jate the—hinsa
 In many areas of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where his followers were in large numbers, people were afraid to travel in the buses and buses with Asaram's seekers, wearing white robes, that their displeasure over even a small thing
 Do not buy
 deshbhar main faile asaram ke takreeban 400 ashramon main se kuch uske saadhakon ne unke asli maalikon se jor-jabardastee yaa blackmel karke hadpe the
 a former follower against him told India Today in detail how the land of Rishikesh's ashram near Haridwar was snatched away by violence from a monk
 hakeekat yah he ki uske bahut-se ashramon kii jameen adalati mukademon main uljhi hui he kyonki unke asli maalik ab apni jameen waapas hasil karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 However, many people have lost their property
 1980 ke dashak main madhya pradesh main ratlam ke najadik panched ke purv rajpariwaar ne apni jameen kaa ek beshkeemtee tukdaa asaram ke anuyaayiyon ko aadhyatmik gatividhiyon ke liye kiraaye par diya tha
 After some time, he found that the ashram had been built on that land, so that the eviction of Asaram's seekers was no longer his thing
 panched ke maujuuda thakur om singh chouhan ke mutabik, rajasav afasaron kii mileebhagat se dastavejon tak main herapheri kar di gai or aakhirkaar parivaar ko vah jameen chhodie or asaram ke ek trust ko oune-paune daam par bechney ke liye majaboor kar diya gaya
 The seekers were trained in violence by the teachings and discourses of Asaram himself
 misaal ke liye apni ek kitaab ke vivaadaaspad upadesh main usne apane anuyaayiyon ko naseehat di thi ki guru sahi ho yaa galat, us par kabhi sawaal khadey mat karo
 In 2008, after the report was published in India Today, the contents of the book were withdrawn
 isamen asaram ne guru kii tulana shiv se kii thi or dhamkee di thi ki agar kisi anuyaayi ne kabhi bhi guru kii peeth main chura bhonkane yaa uske farmaan par huzzat karne kii koshish kii to use bheeshan abhishaap jhelana padegaa
 Going further, he asked the followers not only to be violent but also violent to such an extent that they cut off the language of their opponents
 apane ek bhaashan main usne saadhakon se yah bhi kaha tha ki guru ke khilaaf baghawat karnaa utana hi bada paap he jitna guru patni ke saath sex karnaa
 Then after 9 / 11, he openly praised Osama bin Laden for the fact that he produced followers who were ready to do anything for the sake of their mentor
 ek or ahm baat yah thi ki har saal guru poornima par asaram kaa guru dakshina kaarykram uske liye paisa ugalane kii charkhi ban gaya tha
 On this day, lakhs of people would come and offer Dakshina in the form of money, while maintaining the ancient Indian tradition

 Deve Gowda, Farooq Abdullah, George Fernandes, Rajnath Singh etc
 were attracted to him by the increasing number of his followers (see: The Black Reality of Asaram's Ashram, India Today, October 2, 2013)
 vivaad haalanki samay-samay par asaram kaa peechha karte rahete the, par 1980 se 2008 main apana patan hone tak asaram ne bahut achche din dekhe
 His downfall began when the corpse of two students of his ashram school in Ahmedabad was recovered from the bottom of the Sabarmati river, alleging that Asaram is a tantric who killed these two students for the purpose of extracting body parts for tantric rituals
 aarope to sabit nahin hue par asaram kaa patan jarur shuru ho gaya
 The then Narendra Modi government set up a commission to investigate the allegations, which invited people to testify before them
 asaram ke naaraaz anuyaayi ek-ek kar saamne aane lage or uske samrajya—jo uske treston kii jameen sahit ab tak 25,000 karod ru
 It was done - many dark secrets began to be revealed
 inamen uske kathith yon jivan khaskar ladakiyon ke prati uskaa kathith lagaav shaamil tha
 These allegations were now openly and in front of the media and were being led by some of Asaram's most prominent followers who had now become his enemies
 inamen shaamil the jaanaleva hamalon se kisi tarah batch nikle mahendra chawla or asaram kii kathith gaiyrkanoonee gatividhiyon ke teen pramukh gavaah, jo yaa to maare ja chuke the yaa gaayab ho gaye the—amrit prajapati, jinhen khamosh karne kii garaj se kam se kam chah hinsak hamalon ke baad 2014 main rajkot main goli maar di gai; akhil gupta, jo asaram ke rasoie the or jinaki 2015 main uttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar main goli markar hatya kar di gai; or rahul sachaan, jo november 2015 main police suraksha ke baavjood lakhanu se gaayab ho gaye
 About a fortnight after Sachan's disappearance, the Uttar Pradesh Police registered a report
 yah asaram ke anuyaayiyon ke rasookh ke bare main bataata he, tab bhi jab vah kamjor pad chukaa tha or jail main band tha (balaatkaar ke aarope main vah 2013 se jail main he)
 The important thing is that his followers' attacks on opponents are unusually long
 dilachasp baat yah he ki kisi samay asaram ke vaidya rahe prajapati ne bataaya tha ki unke "guru'' ne unase apane liye sex shakti badhaane vaali ayurvedic dawaaen banane ke liye kaha tha
 He had also told that when the young female devotees were taken to a secluded building in her Ahmedabad ashram for a "guru" darshan, they were given a syrup or slurry of intoxicants called "panchad Herbs"
 It was said, because it came from the ashram of the Panchred
 kuch anuyaayiyon ke mutabik, yah jadi-booti or kuch nahin balki opium kaa ghol thi
 In August 2013, a teenage girl from Uttar Pradesh went to the police authorities in Delhi and told how Asaram physically abused her in his ashram in Jodhpur
 dilli police ne 20 agast ko jiro exiar darj kii or isko phir jodhpur sambandhit thane ko bhej diya
 According to the order of the Supreme Court, firs can be lodged in any part of the country, such a complaint is called zero FIR
 gend apane paale main dekh rajasthan kii congress sarkaar shuru-shuru main to bahut phoonk-phoonk kar kadam rakhti dikhi
 Senior police officials said that the rape of the girl could not even be considered an attempt to rape as Asaram had only touched the upper naked parts of the girl's body and forced her to touch his genitalia
 us samay bahut kam hi log poxo kanoon kii takat se parichit the
 The Poxo law clearly states that if the victim is an underage, then the lascivious molestation of the victim will also be classified as a rape that involves penetration of the sexual organ
 isi kaaran asaram ko aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa hui he
 The Congress government initially seemed reluctant to take action against Asaram as assembly elections were due three months later
 asaram par karrwai se congress ko hindu voton ke khisakane kaa andeshaa tha kyonki bhaajapa pehle se hi gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi kii hindutv lahar se phaayde main dikh rahi thi
 a police officer who has spent a long time behind bars on encounter charges was also described as close to the fake Baba
 is baat kii ashanka thi ki kya yah maamla utana majboot ban sakegaa ki asaram ko aakhirkaar sajaa hi ho jaae
 But there were no orders to cover up the case
 adhikariyon ko yah saaf taur par pataa tha ki unhen karrwai ke dauraan sari prakriya kaa paalan karte hue har kadam bahut saavdhaanee se uthaanaa hoga tabhi ve asaram par haath daal paaenge
 Due to this attitude, he has been punished
 beshak isamen sabase ahm tha peedit or uske parivaar kaa sankalp
 He was willing to take every threat to punish Asaram, a powerful and dangerous character, for his deception
 darasal, mata-pita ne apni beti ko asaram ke paas acchhee shiksha lene ke liye bheja tha
 The girl was appointed to serve Asaram, but he wanted to fulfill her lust
 court ne mana ki yah aparaadh suniyojit tareeke se hua he isliye aaajeevan karawas hi upyukt sajaa hogi
 Ajaypal Lamba, who is leading the investigation, wrote on Facebook shortly after the sentencing, describing the verdict as a milestone: "the verdict will be remembered as a milestone in criminal jurisprudence
" agar nishpaksh hokar kanoon kaa paalan kiya jaae to kamjor se kamjor vyakti bhi asaram jaise atyant prabhaavshaalee aparaadhiyon ko chunauti dekar insaaf paa saktaa he
 "lamba was the DCP at that time and used to report to Jodhpur Police Commissioner Biju Joseph
" lamba khud bhi ipies adhikari hai or unhone is soch ke saath kaam shuru kiya ki peedita ke saath galat to hua he
 What he has told is true but needs to be brought on record and verified well
 unhone rajya police ke adhikari chanchal mishra ko asaram ko girakrataar karne kii jimmedaari saunpi kyonki vah poochtacha main sahyog se inkaar kar rahaa tha or apane indore ashram main chalaa gaya tha
 Mishra adopted all methods to prepare Asaram for peaceful surrender and was also successful
 disambar 2013 main rajasthan main bhaajapa kii sarkaar aate hi shuruyaat main is cese kii jaanch se jude zyaadaatar adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 The new team was more cautious than before
 yahi kaaran he ki aarambhik jaanch or jutaaye gaye sakshya jo ki record par aae the, unke kaaran der se hi sahi par insaaf sambhav hua
 The funny thing is that since the beginning Asaram's followers have been accusing the then Congress President Sonia Gandhi of making him shifty
 jodhpur main hycourt ke vakil sanjeev sharma bhi maanate hai ki asaram ko sonia gandhi or unke parivaar ke khilaaf bolne kii sajaa mili he
 a similar allegation was made by Uma Bharti in 2013: "he is being targeted for opposing Sonia and Rahul Gandhi
 ''is cese ke trial ke dauraan 13 pratyakshdarshiyon par hamale hue or unamem se teen kii jaan bhi chali gai
 One was stabbed to death in a Jodhpur court
 lekin in maamalon kaa sidhaa-sidhaa koi judaav asaram se tha, iske koi saboot ab tak nahin mili hai
 But the manner in which assaults or assassinations were carried out after threatening witnesses in various states, it also shows the failure of police to protect their witnesses
 asaram kii adaalat main aksar hone vaali peshi bhi sargarmi bhari hoti thi
 Hundreds of his supporters waited for hours to get a glimpse of him, and some followed him from court to jail on foot
 ve us samay aakraamak bhi ho jaaya karte the
 The police also made a half-hearted attempt to get the case heard in the jail itself, but the court refused
 phir bhi court ne police kii us apil ko sweekaar liya ki sajaa ke liye asaram ko jail se court lekar aane main kanoon-vyavastha ke bigadgaye kaa khatra he isliye jail main hi adaalat lagaakar sajaa sunai jaae
 Asaram is sentenced under child trafficking and poxo act and his lawyers tried their best to prove the victim an adult
 agar ve naaballig sabit kar pate to asaram ko poxo ke tahat sajaa nahin mil paati or vah itani kadi sajaa se batch jaataa
 But his lawyers could not prove this in court
 asaram ke vakil sajjanraj surana kehete hai, "adaalat ne ek insurance policy ko jajment main shaamil nahin kiya, jo is faisle par sawaal khadey karti he
 However, Jodhpur Bar Association president Ranjit Joshi says, "the verdict has been based on witnesses and evidence
" ''asaram kii pravaktaa neelam doobe ne ab hycourt main apil karne kii baat kahi he
 The question is, will he get bail from the upper court? In fact, Asaram was charged under various sections and the court sentenced him in his judgment after a detailed hearing of the case
 use sakht sajaa sunai gai he
 It is the higher courts that will decide whether continuing punishment is justified or whether concurrent punishment is sufficient
 khayr, jo bhi ho par is baat kii aashaa kam hi he ki vah kisi bhi surat main apane jeevankaal main jail se baahar aa paaegaa
 Nevertheless, the big courts have, from time to time, given great relief to the accused even in major crimes
 salmaan khan kaa maamla hi le len
 This also happened near Jodhpur and will continue for many years to come
 asaram ko aashaa he ki vah ek din jail se chhutegaa or raja kii tarah shaano-shaukat kii apni jindagi phir se ji sakegaa
 Other victims, who were put to death in Asaram's lawsuits to prevent them from opening their secrets and silencing them, are now demanding justice
 inamen se kai maamalon kii jaanch kuch aage badi he, par ek bhi maamle main vah asaram ke gale tak nahin pahunchi he
 Although his loyalists say that Asaram had no role in these attacks and murders, the relatives of the victims say that there is evidence of Asaram's complicity that automatically narrates the story
 maare gaye akhil gupta ke pita naresh gupta kehete hai, "mere bete kii hatya main giraftaar do kathith hamalaavaron main se ek ne asal main police ko bataaya he ki use maarane kii sajeesh asaram ke do darjan anuyaayiyon ne gajiabad ke ashram main rachi thi
 The phone call records of all the suspects should be examined and if they are strictly questioned, the whole story will be revealed
 hamaare paas pakki jaankaree he ki in logon ko ye sandesh asaram se hi mila karte the, yaa to bichauliyon ke jariye yaa khud asaram hi jodhpur jail se gaiyrkanoonee phone kol ke jariye sidhe ye sandesh bheja karata tha
 Apart from investigating the call records and interrogating the jailer of Jodhpur jail, there should be an investigation of those who had come to meet Asaram during the murder period
 isse sachaai ujagar ho sakati he
 "but a difference can be seen in these complaints against Asaram and his followers
" asaram ke khilaaf adaalat ke is kade faisle ke baad ab in logon ke bheetar ummid or bharosa jagaa he ki asaram ke gale main kanoon kaa fanda kas saktaa he
 Asaram alias prisoner number 130 will now spend the last day of his life in the same Rajasthan jail from where he emerged as a saint
 jaahir he, asaram kii yah kalank katha rasookh or paise kii akut satta ke mad main chur hokar arsh se farsh tak pahunchane kii haroonges kahani he

 The 'muktidham' temple, famous for the sacrifice of ancestors, is located in Gaya and is the same place where Mother Sita performed the body of Lord Shri Ram's father and his father-in-law King Dasaratha

 The Gaya Dham in Bihar is also recorded in texts including the Jikagarud Purana
 kaha jaataa he ki gayaji main shraadh karne maatr se hi aatma ko vishnulok praapt ho jaataa he
 According to the legend, according to a legend, during the exile period, Lord Rama along with his brother Lakshmana reach Dham to pay obeisance to Father Dasaratha
 pindadaan ke liye ram or lakshmana jaruri saamaan lene jate hai or mata sita unka intjaar karti hai
 After a long time, the two brothers do not return, then suddenly the soul of King Dasharatha comes to Mother Sita and asks for Pinddaan
 raja dasharath kii maang par mata sita falgu nadi ke kinare baithkar vahaan lage ketki ke phulon or gaay ko sakshi maanakar baaluu ke pind banaakar unke liye pindadaan karti hai
 After some time, when Lord Rama and Lakshmana return with the material, Sita tells them that she has donated Maharaj Dasaratha
 is par shriram bina samragipindadaan ko maananese inkaar karte hue unhen iskaa pramaan dene ko kehete hai
 On the evidence of Lord Rama, Sita asked to testify with Ketki flowers, cow and sand clay, but no one testified in favor of Sitaji except the Vatavriksha installed there
 iske baad sitaaji ne maharaj dasharath kii aatma kaa dhyaan kar unheen se gavaahi dene kii prarthana kii
 At his insistence, the soul of Maharaja Dasharatha appeared and he said that Sita had given him his body
 apane pita kii gavaahi paakar bhagwaan ram aashwast ho gaye
 At the same time, angry on lying Falgu river and Ketki flowers, Mother Sita cursed Falgu river to dry up
 shraap ke kaaran aaj bhi falgu nadi kaa pani sookhaa hua he or keval barish main dinon main isamen kuch pani hota he

 kangana ranut kii film 'manikarnika: da queen of jhaansi' kaa vivaad sulajhata nazar aa rahaa he
 Actually, Karni Sena objected to Kangana's film recently
 karani sena ne rani lakshmibai par besd is film ke do seens ko lekar aapatti jataai thi
 He threatened the producers that if he did not show the film before release, he would perform violently and not allow the movie to be released in theaters
 karani sena ke is bayaan ke baad kangana ne bhi tikhaa waar kiya tha
 She had said that she had shown Manikarnika to four historians and the censors had also passed the film
 agar karani sena iske baad bhi dikkatein karti hai to rajput hone ke naate ve bhi karani sena ke sadasyon ko sabak sikhaaengi
 Kangana's statement seems to have an effect and after the national spokesperson of Karni Sena, now the Chief of Karni Sena also said that she has no problem with the film
 india today ke saath baatcheet main karani sena ke chif lokendra singh kalvi ne kaha - 'karani sena ko film manikarnika se kisi tarah kii samasya nahin he kyonki kisi ne bhi ise lekar apni chintaa jaahir nahin kii he
 Neither any family nor any community has raised any objection about this film
 jhaansi ke kisi bhi parivaar or vahaan ke logon main se kisi ne bhi is film par koi sawaal nahin uthaaya he

 ' The BJP has been enraged over Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's recognition of a separate religion for Lingayats
 lekin sach to yah he ki kabhi karnataka bijepi ke pramukh netaa yediurppa ne bhi lingayat ko alag dharm kaa darja dene kaa samarthan kiya tha
 bjp's Chief Ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa also comes from this community
 gauratlab he ki karnataka main vidhansabha chunaavon se thik pehle sattarudh dal congress ne virshaiv lingayat ko alag dharm kii manyata dekar bada daanv khel diya he
 This bet of the Congress may cause trouble for the BJP
 karnataka bijepi ne karnataka congress ke is kadam kii katu aalochana kii he
 The state BJP said, 'seeing how the Congress is dividing the people for political gains, the British will also sink in shame
 secular raashtra kaise ek nae dharm ko paidaa kar saktaa he? samvidhan ke kin pravadhaanon ke tahat ek alag dharm banaaya ja saktaa he? congress ko in sawaalon ko koi parvaah nahin he
 The state BJP president tweeted, "siddaramaiah you must not forget, Mughal and British rule has also been less poisonous than yours
 aapako itihaas main rajya kaa sabase shaatir mukhyamantri mana jayega
 BJP says that Congress has taken this decision in terms of assembly elections
 bijepi kaa tark he ki lingayat-virshaiv samudaay puri tarah se ek hi he, jabaki rajya kii congress sarkaar ne kaha he ki virshaiv samudaay ke jo log samaaj sudhaarak basav ke darshan main vishwaas rakhte hai, sirf unhen hi lingayat mana jayega
 The truth is that in 2013, bjp's Karnataka leader BS Yeddyurappa signed a memorandum demanding similar demands
 tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko bheje gaye gyaapan main yah maang kii gai he ki janaganana form main virshaiv-lingayat dharm ke liye alag code / kollam banaaya jaae, yani virshaiv-lingayat ko alag dharm mana jaae
 Lingayat political analysts consider Lingayat to be an ethnic creed and not a religious one
 rajya main ye anya pichde varg main aate hai
 Due to about 21 percent of the population and being financially sound, they have an effective impact on the politics of Karnataka
 bijepi ne vivaadit yediurppa ko siem pad kaa daavedaar banaakar is samudaay ko lubhaane kii koshish kii thi
 However, now the Congress has played a new bet
 raajnneetik kaarnon kii vajah se bijepi congress ke is kadam kaa virodh kar rahi he
 Due to this, there is speculation that Lingayats will move from BJP to the Congress camp
 centre ke paale main he gendlingayat samudaay lambey samay se maang kar rahe the ki unhen alag dharm kaa darja diya jaae
 The Government of Karnataka approved the recommendations of the Nagmohan Committee under Section 2D of the State Minorities Commission Act
 ab isaki antim manjuuri ke liye centre sarkaar ko prastaav bheja jayega
 On the other hand, the bjp's side has been that it has been considered as part of the Lingayats Kohindu religion

 premdasa stadium main khele gaye twanti-20 vishwa cap ke super-8 daur ke 'karo yaa maro' ke match main chir pratidwandvi pakistan ko aath wicket se haraakar khud ko semifinal kii daud main banaae rakhaa he
 After the embarrassing defeat against Australia in the first match, his breath was seen breaking in the race to the last-4 but this victory has added a new power to him
 yahi nahin, is jeet ke saath bharat ne vishwa cap (twanti-20 or 50 over) main pakistan par ajey sthiti banaae rakhaa he
 At the same time it has won the Super-8 round for the first time since the 2007 World Cup
 2007 main khitaabi jeet hasil karne ke baad bhartiya team 2009 or 2010 main semifinal main nahin pahunch saki thi
 Keeping all these figures in mind and knowing the seriousness of the outcome of this match, the Indian team looked anxious for victory from the beginning
 yahi kaaran he ki pehle to usne pakistan ko 128 ranon ke ausat yoga par out kiya or phir 17 overon main do wicket khokar lakshya hasil kar liya
 India lost the wickets of Gautam Gambhir (0) and Virender Sehwag (25)
 bhartiya team ke khewanhaar banate ja rahe kohli 61 gendon par nau chauke or do chakke lagaakar naabad rahe
 He shared a 74-run partnership with Sehwag after Gambhir was dismissed for one run total
 sahvaag kaa wicket 75 ran ke kul yoga par gira
 Sehwag, who was dropped from the team against Australia, played three important fours in his 24-ball innings, playing a key role in India's victory
 iske baad yuvaraj singh or kohli ne team ko jeet tak pahunchane ke kaam kiya
 Yuvraj remained unbeaten on 19 runs
 unhone apni 16 gendon kii pari main do chauke lagaae
 Both of them added 54 not out for the third wicket
 kohli ne gendbaaji ke dauraan ek wicket bhi hasil kiya tha
 He was voted Man of the Match
 bharat ke paas ab semifinal main pahunchane kaa mauka he, jo australia se mili haar ke baad dhundhala gaya tha lekin iske liye use apane antim super-8 match main dakshin africa ko bade antar se haraana hoga
 Pakistan will face Australia in the final Super-8 match of this group
 australia sabase behatar net ran rate or chaar ankon ke saath semifinal main pahunch chukaa he lekin bharat ko jeet ke saath-saath apana net ran rate bhi behatar karnaa hoga kyonki australia ko haraane kii surat main pakistan antim-chaar main pahunch jayega kyonki philhal uskaa net ran rate bharat se behatar he
 In this way, India will not only have to play for victory in their last Super-8 match but they will also have to play Pakistan (-0
 43) se aage nikalnaa hoga
 India's net run rate (-0
 45) he or is aadhaar par vah group-2 kii talika main tisare sthaan par kabiz he

 ek maheene main use bhi baahar nikaalane kaa pehle hi bandobast ho chukaa tha
 Earlier, Hafiz Saeed's lawyer told Aaj Tak that the government of Pakistan did not present any evidence
 bharat ne hafiz said ke khilaaf jo saboot pakistan ko die the, unhen dekha tak nahin gaya
 The US fbi's own investigation in the Mumbai attack case was also not given in the court
 2008 main hi yahi hua tha, jab mumbai hamale ke baad hafiz pakadaa gaya tha, tab bhi use chhod diya gaya tha
 The government of Pakistan may file its new cases against Hafiz Saeed under pressure from the US
 khabar he ki paak sarkaar hafiz kii rihaai ke bare main hoicourt ke aadesh par supreme court main samiksha yachika bhi daayar kar sakati he

 said sahit chaar anya ko uski party or raajnneetik sahyogiyon ke gusse or hangaame ke bich 30 janvari ko najarband kiya gaya tha
 Saeed was placed under house arrest even after the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, but was released by the court in 2009

 pakistan ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa mohammad faisal ne kaha ki is bare main bharat ke saath ab tak koi aadhikarik charchaa nahin hui he
 This statement from Pakistan is exactly the opposite of Sidhu's claim
 bataa den ki navjot singh siddhu ne pakistan se bharat aane ke baad ek press conference main kaha tha ki pakistan sarkaar ne kartarpur root ko kholane kaa faisla kiya he or is bare main bharat ko apni manshaa bhi bataai he

 Chief Minister Sheila Dixit said that there is no question of any alliance after the elections
 isse pehle, ek angreji channel se baatcheet main dikshit ne kaha tha ki jarurat padane par ham aam aadmi party ke saath gathbandhan kar sakate hai
 Sheila said that she did not ask for support from AAP after the election

 At the same time, Yogendra Yadav has made it clear from the AAP party that the AAP party will neither support any party nor seek support from anyone

 Residents of Amrit Haven Housing Complex sent a message to the Social Media Group for security

 The name of lashkar-e-taliban was seen by the colonel's Vinayak Iyer and his colleagues said that when they used to put their mobile network in search for wi-fi, the name of lashkar-e-taliban was seen in it
 hamen pataa tha ki kisi ne ye naam rakhaa hoga lekin ham apane complex main koi chance nahin lenaa chaahate the, is vajah se ham police stesan pahunche
 He further said that the police became active immediately and found out about this login

 police stesan main flats maalik ke bete ne sweekaar kiya ki usne hi apane wifai login kaa naam aatanki sanghathan ke naam par rakhaa tha
 In this case, the police told that when we asked the boy about it, the boy replied that he did it to unify something

 The country's largest political arena, Lok Sabha Elections 2019, is on its head
 'mahamuqabla' kii ranbheri bajane se thik pehle pashchim bengal kii rajdhani kolkata main mamata banerjee (mamata Banarjee) ne sabhi vipakshi partiyon ko ek manch par saath laakar na sirf apnishkthi kaa pradarshan kiya he, balki vipakshi ekta kii jhalak bhi dikhaa di he
 But the separation of Congress President Rahul Gandhi and UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi from this rally of Mamata Banerjee are raising many questions in themselves
 modi sarkaar ke khilaaf vipaksh kaa rashtriya str par mahagathbandhan kii kavayad hakeekat kaa jama pehnegaa yaa phir yah fasaana banakar rah jayega yah to khayr vakt batayega, magar kai rajyon main jis tarah se congress se kshetreey partiyaan duuri banaati dikh rahi hai, usase yah ab ek baar phir se charchaa hone lagi he ki kya sach main vipaksh ekajute he? aise sawaal man main isliye bhi kaundh rahe hai kyonki mamata ke manch par kareeb 20 rajnatik dalon ke netaa maujuud dikhe, jinamein se kuch kaa congress ke saath gathbandhan he or kuch aise hai jo loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke bagaiyr ladane kaa elaan kar chuke hai
 The gathering of opposition leaders in Kolkata makes it clear that even though there is no alliance between them, they are trying to show people that they are one against the Modi government
 darasal, shanivaar ko mamata banerjee dwaara aahut 'sanyukt bharat raily' main kareeb 20 se 22 dalon ke 20 netaa ek manch par saath aae
 These leaders have come together on one platform, but there are many of them who have already decided to separate from the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections
 agar ek manch par vipakshi dalon ke netaa ek saath najar aa bhi jate hai to ab sawaal uthta he ki kya bijepi ko haraane ke liye ek saath chunavi maidan main bhi utrenge? iskaa jawaab shaayad zyaadaatar naa hi hoga
 Because recently in Uttar Pradesh, Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav announced the alliance of SP-BSP and confirmed that the Congress has become alone in UP
 yani upi main ab congress ko bijepi se to ladanaa he hi, saath hi use basapa or sapa se bhi ladanaa he
 In this way, the vision with the opposition parties is clear that the Modi government is to be defeated by the power of the Center, but how to remove it is not known
 upi main baat karen to 80 loksabhaa siton par basapa-sapa ne saath-saath ladane kaa elaan kar diya he
 Congress has not found a place in this alliance
 yani yahaan congress ko bijepi or sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke khilaaf akele ladanaa he
 But surprisingly, in Mamta's rally, all three became witnesses of opposition unity
 ab sawaal uthta he ki agar manch par ye partiyaan ek saath hone kaa damakham dikhaa rahi he, to phir chunaav main jane se kyon kataraa rahi he?
 Congress leader and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal was also on Mamata Banerjee's platform in Kolkata
 congressor aam aadmi party donon modi sarkaar ke khilaaf vipabhi ekajutata raily ke sadsy the, magar7 loksabhaa siton vaaledilli main ye partiyaan alag-alag chunaav ladengi
 Earlier, there was a possibility of an alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress in Delhi, but after the statements of Sheila Dixit and Gopal Rai, these possibilities have been dashed
 matlab dilli main bhi congress bijepi se to ladegi hi, saath hi vah aam aadmi party se bhi chunavi jang karegi
 Even though Mamata Banerjee led the opposition unity in Kolkata before the Lok Sabha elections on Saturday
 magar vah manch par bhale hi congress ke saath hai, lekin chunavi maidan main congress ke saath nahin hai
 Mamta Banerjee has already announced that she will contest the Lok Sabha elections alone
 yani tiemasi kaa congress se gathbandhan nahin hoga
 So here too the Congress will fight the BJP as well as the TMC
 telugana main tiares ke mukhiya or mukhyamantri ke chandrashekhar raav fedral front kii baat kar rahe hai
 KCR, engaged in the exercise of Federal Front, has also met Kejriwal, Mamta Banerjee, Akhilesh etc
 for this
 vah na to congress ke saath aana chaahate hai or na hi bijepi ke saath
 In this way, the Congress is alone in Telangana with 17 Lok Sabha seats
 uske saamne bijepi or tiares donon se ladane kii chunauti he
 Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu said on Saturday from Mamta's platform that Modi government must be removed from the Center to save the constitution
 iske liye vah mahagathbandhan kii kavayad to karte dikh rahe hai, magar abhi tak use amali jama nahin pana paae hai
 Chandrababu Naidu has not yet announced whether he will go with the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections
 yah baat alag he ki telugana vidhansabha chunaav main vah congress ke saath the
 Please tell that there are 25 Lok Sabha seats here
 40 loksabhaa siton vaale bihar main mahagathbandhan kii haalat anya rajyon se behatar he
 RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav also appeared on Mamta's stage
 bas bihar se hi congress ke liye raahat kii khabar dikh rahi he
 Because there the Congress is part of the grand alliance with the RJD
 magar siton ko lekar vahaan bhi takaraar kii khabaren hai
 But it is clear that the Congress will be part of the Grand Alliance in Bihar
 21 loksabhaa siton vaale odisha main bhi congress puri tarah se akeli he
 There are also two big parties in front of the Congress, which is not so easy to overcome
 odisha ke mukhyamantri or bijd pramukh naveen patnayak saaf kah chuke hai ki vah na to congress ke saath jaaenge or na hi bijepi ke saath
 At the same time, the Congress is with the National Conference in Jammu and Kashmir
 vahaan pidipi or bijepi ke alag hone se thodi raahat congress ko jarur milegi
 But the road is not so easy
 chhattisgarh vidhansabha chunaav vaala mayawati kii basapa kaa ajit jogi se gathbandhan agar loksabhaa chunaav main rahata he to congress ke liye yahaan bhi mushkilen badhenge
 In this way, even before the Lok Sabha elections, even though the balloons of opposition unity are being inflated against the Modi government at the national level, there is still a cloud of doubt over how long it will erupt
 mahagathbandhan ke centre main bhale hi desh kii sabase puraani party congress he, magar jo tasviren abhi dikh rahi hai, usamen vah kai jagah alag-thalag dikh rahi he

 But this meeting is going on in Patna on Saturday, everyone came to know when Rashtriya Janata Dal leaders boycotted this meeting
 unka virodh is baat ko lekar tha ki up mukhyamantri susheel modi ne apane sambodhan main ye kah diya ki filhal desh ke chaar purv mukhyamantri jail main hai
 In this meeting going on in Patna's Bapu Auditorium, the uproar itself had to calm the Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and he also said that this is not a Bihar Legislative Assembly
 lekin rajd ke vidhayak or netaaon par iskaa koi asar nahin hua or wo walkout kar gayi
 Later RJD leaders said that Modi should have avoided such remarks and tried to provoke everyone by speaking it deliberately
 tippaniyan Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav abstained from the event and tweeted that, 'tainted leader Sushil Modi has committed a disgusting act of tarnishing Bihar in front of representatives of 52 countries at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Union Conference, Patna
 bihar ke sabase bade for twanti bhaajapai netaa susheel modi khud anekon maamalon main daagi hai
 They are the biggest scamsters
 ' unhone aage likhaa, 'alp gyani susheel modi ne rashtramandal sansadeey sangh sammelan main yah kyon nahin bataaya ki bihar ke mukhyamantri par sangeen hatya kaa maamla darj he? mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ek JNU chaatr kii thisis churaane ke aarope main sazaayafata hai
 75% ministers are tainted in the Council of Ministers of Bihar
 ' tejasvi aage likhte hai, 'susheel modi ne yah kyon nahin bataaya ki nitish ke netritv main bihar me record tod 40 ghotaale hue hai? yah kyon nahin bataaya ki unki bahan or unhone srijan ghotaale kaa karodon nigal liya
 Sushil Modi used this platform to hide his black corruption
 choron kaa chor eemaandaaree batiyaa rahaa he
 In another tweet, Tejashwi wrote, 'sushil Modi should apologize for wiring the parliamentary system
 mukhyamantri se mauni baba bane nitish kumaar ji ko bhi is ghatana par munh kholana chahie ki kya majaburi he ki unhone aise tarkahin galibaaz vyakti ko upmukhyamantri bana rakhaa he? At the same time, Sushil Modi said that the way the leaders of RJD have behaved, it seems that the thief has a beard
 susheel modi ne aarope lagaaya ki rajd netaaon kaa bhadakna ‘chor kii dadhi main tinke’ kii kahawat ko charitaarth karata he
 Referring to a judgment of the Supreme Court on Friday, Sushil said that the central and state governments have taken several steps during the past several years to curb corruption
 isse vidhayika kii vishwasaneeyata main or adhik ijapha hoga
 On being told in front of the Deputy Chief Minister that presently four former Chief Ministers of the country are jailed on one or the other charges of corruption, the RJD mlas present in the auditorium stood up from their seats and started an uproar, protesting and Shouting slogans left the auditorium
 ullekhneey he ki bihar ke purv mukhyamantri or rajd pramukh lalu prasad karodon rupee ke chaara ghotaalaa se jude ek maamle main vatarmman main jail main band hai
