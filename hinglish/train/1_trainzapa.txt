 ye kaarobaar jaisaa pehle chalata tha vaisaa hi chalata rahegaa
 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you
 bharat mata kii jai

 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days

 use bhi raashtra hit main, raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan dena he
 But such moments only come to be counted in everyone's life
 aaj samay hamen phir se ek avasar de rahaa he
 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency 
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 tippaniyan From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience for a few days, then it is unheard of, i say, it is the unflinching citizen of my country will choose the inconvenience, but never corruption Will choose aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hum ki aaie jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daalkar ise safal banaaie
 In such a big country, in view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a cleanliness, let us all celebrate the Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life
 main aap sabake sahyog ke liye puure vishwaas ke saath sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ki madad se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf is ladaai ko or aage le janaa chahta hum
 i am sure your support, your cooperation will be inspiring for generations to come
 main phir ek baar aapkaa hriday se aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 Long live Mother India

 ye kaarobaar jaisaa pehle chalata tha vaisaa hi chalata rahegaa
 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you

 22
 International tourists will be allowed to exchange foreign currency or old notes of up to Rs 5,000 with new and valid currency notes at international airports
 23
 Apart from all these facilities, i would like to clarify that there will be no interruption in the entire process in non-cash transactions ie payment by check, payment by demand draft, debit or credit card payment or electronic fund transfer
 ye kaarobaar jaisaa pehle chalata tha vaisaa hi chalata rahegaa
 Despite all these arrangements, if our honest countrymen suffered, then experience shows that the common citizen of this country is never left behind to sacrifice and suffer for the good of the country
 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake

 jab main sunata hum ki koi garib vidhwaa LPG sabsidi chhodane main aage aati he, yah tyaag ek ritred skool teacher main bhi paaya jaataa he jab wo pension se svachh bharat kosh main yogadan dene ko aage aata he, jab ham ye sunate hai ki garib adivasee maa kaa bakrii bechakar shauchalay banane ke liye paise laga detii he, ek faujee kaa apane gaanv ko svachh gaanv banane ke liye sattaavan hazaar rupee kaa daan dene ke liye aage aata he
 i have seen that the common citizen of the country has only one desire that he is ready to do anything - just welfare of the country
 atah bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note or aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main ham log thodi si kathinaayee vah bhi kuch dinon ke liye to jhel hi sakate hai
 i fully believe that every citizen of the country will stand together against corruption in this Mahayagya of purity
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyo, After the festival of Diwali, now in this festival of sincerity, in this festival of authenticity, you raise your hands high
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal, rajnatik kaaryakarta, saamaajik or shaikshanik sansthaaen, media sahit samaaj ke sabhi varg se is mahaan kaary main sarkaar se bhi zyada bad chadh kar bhaag lenge, sakaaratmak bhoomika adaa karenge or is kaary ko safal bana kar hi rahenge
 My dear countrymen, ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa
 i once again express my heartfelt gratitude to you
 bharat mata kii jai

 in sari suvidhaon ke alaava main yah spasht karnaa chaahunga ki is puri prakriya main non-cash len dein main yani check se pement, demand draft se pement, debit yaa credit card se pement athwa electronic fund transafar main koi rukaawat nahin aegi
 This business will continue to run as before
 in saare intazaam ke baavjood hamaare eemaandaar deshavaasiyon ko agar takalif kaa saamana karnaa padaa to anubhav yah bataata he ki is desh kaa saamaanya naagarik desh kii bhalaai ke liye tyaag karne or kathinaayee sahane ke liye kabhi bhi peeche nahin rahata he
 When i hear that a poor widow comes forward to give up LPG subsidy, this renunciation is also found in a retired school teacher when he comes forward to contribute to the Swachh Bharat Kosh from pension, when we hear that poor tribals The mother's goat sells money to build toilets, a soldier comes forward to donate 57 thousand rupees to make his village a clean village
 maine to yah dekha he ki desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii ek hi tamanna he ki vah kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar he – bas desh kaa kalyaan ho
 Therefore, in the war against corruption, black money, counterfeit notes and terrorism, we can face some difficulty even for a few days
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki desh kaa prayek naagarik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shuchita ke is mahayajna main milakar khadaa hoga
 My dear countrymen, diwali ke parv ke baad, ab eemaandaaree ke is utsav main, pramanikta ke is parv main aap bad chadh kar haath bataaen
 i fully believe that all political parties, political activists, social and educational institutions of the country, including all sections of society, including the media, will participate more actively in this great work than the government, play a positive role and make this work successful
 Will continue to do it
 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, When i am putting these things in front of you, at the same time, different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, even their officials have no information before this
 Is received
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahano or bhaaiyo, From time to time, the Reserve Bank has been bringing in circulation of new high denomination notes with the consent of the Central Government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha
 In this entire process, the proposal of a new note of Rs 2,000 has been accepted by the Reserve Bank
 puri tarah se nae taur par dijin kiye gaye 500 rupee or 2,000 rupee ke nae karency note ab cirkulation main laayaa jayega
 In view of the past experiences of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank will make necessary arrangements to ensure that the denomination of high denomination notes is now within a limit
 ant main mere pyaare deshavaasiyo i want to reiterate that there are moments in the history of a country when every person realizes that they too have to be a part of that moment
 use bhi raashtra hit main, raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan dena he
 But such moments only come to be counted in everyone's life
 aaj samay hamen phir se ek avasar de rahaa he
 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 tippaniyan From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience for a few days, then it is unheard of, i say, it is the unflinching citizen of my country will choose the inconvenience, but never corruption Will choose aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hum ki aaie jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daalkar ise safal banaaie
 In such a big country, in view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a cleanliness, let us all celebrate the Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life
 main aap sabake sahyog ke liye puure vishwaas ke saath sava sau karod deshavaasiyon ki madad se bhrashtachar ke khilaaf is ladaai ko or aage le janaa chahta hum
 i am sure your support, your cooperation will be inspiring for generations to come
 main phir ek baar aapkaa hriday se aabhaar vyakt karata hum
 Long live Mother India

 mere pyaare deshavaasiyon, When i am putting these things in front of you, at the same time, different departments of the government are also getting information, be it bank, post office, railway, hospital, even their officials have no information before this
 Is received
 kyonki is kaam main gopneeyata bahut hi aavashyak thi
 In such a situation, the Reserve Bank, all banks and post offices have to make a lot of arrangements in a short time
 is vyavastha main kuch samay to jayega
 Therefore, the Reserve Bank has decided that on 9 November all banks will remain closed for public works
 nagarikon ko asuvidha hogi
 i am confident that all the colleagues working in banks and post offices will successfully complete this sacred work in the interest of the country
 bhootkaal main unhone ye karke dikhaaya he
 i request the Janata Janardan so much that all citizens should be patient and cooperate with all banks and post office officers, this is my request and request
 bahano or bhaaiyo, From time to time, the Reserve Bank has been bringing in circulation of new high denomination notes with the consent of the Central Government
 2014 main reserve bank ne 5,000 or 10,000 rupee ke karency note kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja tha jise hamaari sarkaar ne vichaar-vimarsh ke baad asweekaar kar diya tha
 In this entire process, the proposal of a new note of Rs 2,000 has been accepted by the Reserve Bank
 puri tarah se nae taur par dijin kiye gaye 500 rupee or 2,000 rupee ke nae karency note ab cirkulation main laayaa jayega
 In view of the past experiences of the Reserve Bank, the Reserve Bank will make necessary arrangements to ensure that the denomination of high denomination notes is now within a limit
 ant main mere pyaare deshavaasiyo i want to reiterate that there are moments in the history of a country when every person realizes that they too have to be a part of that moment
 use bhi raashtra hit main, raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan dena he
 But such moments only come to be counted in everyone's life
 aaj samay hamen phir se ek avasar de rahaa he
 Every ordinary citizen can contribute in this fight against corruption, black money, fake currency
 bahano or bhaaiyo aapse is prakriya main jitna sahyog milegaa, shuddhikaran utana hi safal hoga
 It was a cause of concern for the country that corruption and black money were considered an easy part of life
 yah soch aaj hamaare rajnatik, saamaajik, or prashasnic jivan ko dimak kii tarah khaae ja rahaa he
 No part of the governance system is untouched by this termite
 tippaniyan From time to time, we have seen that if the general public mind of India has to choose one of corruption and inconvenience for a few days, then it is unheard of, i say, it is the unflinching citizen of my country will choose the inconvenience, but never corruption Will choose aapse main phir ek baar aahvaan karata hum ki aaie jaise aapane diwali ke parv main apane ghar or aas pados kii safai kii, vaise hi safai ke kaam ko aage badhaate hue, ham is mahayajna main apni purnahuti daalkar ise safal banaaie
 In such a big country, in view of the inconvenience in the great cause of such a cleanliness, let us all celebrate the Diwali of purity, show this faithfulness of India to the whole world, celebrate the festival of authenticity in the whole country so that corruption can be curbed, To crack down on black money, to enable those who play the game of fake notes, so that the money of the country can be used for the poor, every honest citizen should be successful in the country's prosperity Could not get a fair share, future generations proud to live your life

 Long live Mother India
 ye baaten jab main aapke samaksh rakh rahaa hum, isi samay sarkaar ke alag-alag vibhaagon ko bhi jaankaree ho rahi he, bank ho, post offis ho, railway ho, aspataal ho, unke adhikariyon ko bhi is vishay kii isse pehle koi jaankaree nahin mili he
 Because confidentiality was very important in this work
 aisi sthiti main reserve bank, sabhi banks or post offis ko kam samay main bahut sari vyavastha kerani he
 There will be some time in this system
 isliye reserve bank ne yah faisla liya he ki 9 navambar ko sabhi bank public kaary ke liye band rahenge
 Citizens will be inconvenienced
 meraa puraa bharosa he ki bank or post offis main kaam karne vaale sabhi saathi desh hit main is pavitra kaary ko safaltaapurvak paripurna karenge
 In the past, they have shown this by doing this
 meraa janata-janardan se itnaa hi aagrah he ki sabhi naagarik dhairya rakhte hue sabhi banks or post offis adhikariyon ke saath sahyog karen, yahi meri unase aagrah or binati he
 Sisters and brothers, samay-samay par mudravyavastha ko dhyaan main rakhkar reserve bank, centre sarkaar kii sahmati se nae adhik mulya ke note ko cirkulation main laata rahaa he
 In 2014, the Reserve Bank sent a proposal for a currency note of 5,000 and 10,000 rupees to the government, which was rejected by our government after deliberations
 ab is puri prakriya main reserve bank dwaara 2,000 rupee ke nae note ke prastaav ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 The completely redesigned 500 rupees and new rupee notes of 2,000 rupees will now be brought in circulation
 reserve bank apane pichley anubhavon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue, karency cirkulation main adhik mulya ke noton kaa hissaa ab ek seemaa ke andar hi rahe iske liye reserve bank aavashyak prabandh karegaa
 Finally my dear countrymen main yah doharaana chahta hum ki kisi desh ke itihaas main aise kshan aate hai jab har vyakti yah mahasoos karata he ki use bhi us kshan kaa hissaa bananaa he
 He too has to contribute in the national interest, in nation building
 parantu aise kshan har kisi kii jindagi main gine chune hi aate hai
 Today, time is again giving us an opportunity
 har saamaanya naagarik bhrashtachar, kaala dhan, jaali note ke khilaaf is mahayajna main , is ladaai main apana yogadan de saktaa he
 Brothers and brothers, the more cooperation you get in this process, the more successful the purification will be
 desh ke liye yah chintaa kaa kaaran tha ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ko jivan kaa ek sahaj hissaa maan liya gaya tha
 This thinking is eating our political, social, and administrative life like a termite
 shashan vyavastha kaa koi bhi ang is dimak se achoota nahin he
 The comments samay-samay par hamane dekha he ki bharat ke saamaanya jan maanas ko agar bhrashtachar or kuch dinon kii asuvidha main se ek ko chunanaa ho, to vah behichak, main kahata hum behichak mere desh kaa eemaandaar naagarik asuvidha ko to chunegaa lekin bhrashtachar ko kadaapi nahin chunegaa
 i once again call upon you that, as you have cleaned your house and neighborhood in the festival of Diwali, in the same way, we can make it successful by putting our full sacrifice in this Mahayagya
 itane bade desh main, itani badi safai ke mahaparv main asuvidha ko dhyaan main na rakhte hue aaie sabhi shuchita kii diwali manaaen, puure vishwa ko bharat kii is eemaandaaree kaa utsav dikhaaen, puure desh main pramanikta kaa parv manaaen jisase bhrashtachar par lagaam lag sake, kaale dhan par nakel kas sake, jaali noton kaa khel khilne waalon ko nestnabud kar sake, jisase ki desh kaa dhan garibon ke kaam aa sake, har eemaandaar naagarik ko desh kii sampannataa main uski uchit hissedari mil sake, aane vaali peedi garv se apana jivan ji sake
 i want to take this fight against corruption further with the help of 125 crore countrymen with full confidence for your cooperation
 mujhe vishwaas he aapkaa saath, aapkaa sahyog aane vaali pidiyon ke liye prerak banegaa

 The prick of this slowdown caused by the breakdown of consumption and investment can be felt in the state and urban economies spread across the country, which have led to demand and new jobs in the last decade

 After a close look at the crisis in the world after 2008, it was felt in many countries of the world that their local prosperity was confined to a few dozen national and international companies

 The answer to a pill is not a bid, but the bullet itself
 surendra singh ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki wo raajnneetik jameendaar parivaar ke vaaris hai
 Rahul has inherited the presidency, but he will not be able to become Prime Minister in this birth, because the people of the country will not hand over the legacy to him
 ho saktaa he, aane vaale chah maheenon ke bheetar bharat ke sabase mahatvakankshi ladaaku vimaan vikaas kaaryakramon se ek ko apane astitv ke liye asamanjas-bhare maahaul kaa saamana karnaa pade
 It is likely that in December, the Defense Ministry will decide whether to stop developing, or continue to develop, a version of the indigenously built light combat aircraft 'tejas' that can fly from the aircraft carrier and landing on it
 
 sarkaar pehle hi is ladaaku vimaan ko viksit karne ke liye 3,500 karod rupee aavantit kar chuki he, or ab use saaf-saaf jawaab kii zarurat he
 Will the prototype of the tejas-n, which is currently being tested, take the form of an aircraft that can fly from a ship, land on it, and be able to deal with emerging threats in the Indian Ocean region? And can state-of-the-art versions of this prototype, called the LCA-N Mk-2, be developed, manufactured and deployed within a fixed time frame of five to seven years? ab chunki vikaas kaarykram kii gati badhaane ke alaava koi chaara nahin bachaa he, isliye bhartiya nausena, aironotical dizine agency (ADA) tathaa hindustan aironautics limited (HAL) ke payalton, ejiniyaron or dizine-team sadasyon kii ek choti kor team ji-jaan se juty hui he ki ahm lakshyon ko samay se puraa kiya ja sake
 At present, the biggest goal of this time is a ten-and-a-half-ton fighter jet flying at a speed of less than 260 kilometers (140 knots), quickly bending, landing, imitating the deck of the aircraft carrier on the seashore with its hook on the fuselage
 This means to catch the arresting wire on the runway, and be sure to stop within just 90 meters
 kisi bhi vimanavahak pot ke deck par 'arested landing' ke liye yahi sab kuch karnaa padataa he, jo ab tak kuch hi ladaaku vimaan kar pate hai, jinhen america, rus, united kingdom, france or haal hi main china ne viksit kiya he
 The repeated success of this test in a test facility built on a beach in Goa will prove that the LCA-N is the most important design feature - this aircraft can withstand the response of 'arrested Landing' on the deck of any aircraft carrier - Perfect doing work
 jab samudratat par hone vaale ye pareekshan safal ho jaaenge, tabhi LCA-N ke prototip ke vikaas kaarykram kaa netritv kar rahe nausena payalat aglaa kadam uthaa paaenge - yani bharat ke ekmaatr oparational vimanavahak pot INS vikramaditya par vastav main ise land karaayaa jayega
 Important members of the LCA-N development team told NDTV that they had flown to the Goa Test facility 60 times in the last nearly a month, and were ready to start the crucial landing trials at the end of the monsoon
 vimaan ko INS vikramaditya ke deck par pahunchane ke liye LCA-N ke ejiniyaron or payalton ko is baat ke prati aashwast hona hoga ki vimaan 7
 a vessel can reach the vessel without being damaged by a 'sink rate' (downward speed) of 5 meters per second (1,500 feet per minute)
 haalanki sambhawatah ve is sinc rate par vimaan kaa pareekshan tatkaal nahin karenge, lekin pot trial ke yogya sabit hone ke liye unhen safaltaapurvak siddh karnaa hoga ki ve 5
 Can land at a sync rate of 6 meters per second
 ab tak vimaan kaa pareekshan 5
 1 meter per second sync rate
 project se jude ejiniyaron tathaa payalton ko bharosa he ki ve landing certification ke lakshya ko hasil kar lenge
 Even if the LCA-N test qualifies the INS to land on Vikramaditya's deck, there are two critical hurdles that must be overcome
 vimaan ko uda rahe test payalton ko landing ke dauraan utarane se ain pehle vimanavahak pot se hatane vaali hawa ke prabhaav ko khud anubhav karnaa hoga
 a safe 'arrested landing' requires the LCA-N to maintain an approximately uniform speed of 240–260 km (130–140 knots) while descending, and take care that the wind decks on the deck of the vessel easily impact it happens
 in halaat kaa anubhav lene ke liye test payalat kai baar INS vikramaditya ke deck par 'tach and go' karenge, jisamen ve utarate hi puri tarah ruke bina dobaaraa udaan bhar lete hai
 The entire 'arrested Landing' will take place on the aircraft carrier only when the test pilots are assured of stability of the aircraft while coming down for landing and to maintain a uniform speed while landing
 iske alaava, ek or badi takneekee chintaa he, jo LCA-N ke vikaas kaarykram par asar daal sakati he
 The mechanic low system, which reduces its speed at the time of landing of the aircraft on the INS Vikramaditya , ie the Arrestor gear, is quite different from the Arrestor gear in terms of design, which is in the test facility in Goa
 LCA-N project team ke ahm sadsy ummid kar rahe hai ki is antar se project par asar nahin padegaa, lekin aashwast ve tabhi ho sakenge, jab vastav main pot par landing kar lee jaaegi
 And finally, the biggest problem - what the key member of the tejas-n team has called the 'acquisition vs
 development debate'
 haalanki abhi nausena LCA-N project ko puraa samarthan de rahi he, lekin vah america yaa france se 57 purnatah viksit ladaaku vimaan kharidne ke liye bhi utsuk he
 The Indian Navy is eyeing the Boeing FA / 18E / f 'hornet' and the rafale-m manufactured by Dassau, which have proven themselves to be used in battle
 ab ahm sawaal yah he - kya tejas-en ke vikaas kaarykram tathaa pashchim se is tarah ke vimaanon kaa kharida janaa, donon ke liye paryaapt fund uplabdh hoga?tejas-en team ke sadasyon ne NDTV se kaha ki unase aksar poocha jaataa he, "aapako aisa kuch phir se banane kii kya zarurat he, jo pehle hi banaaya ja chukaa he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing a rally in Basirhat, West Bengal on 15 May, gave a slogan in Bengali "unishei Saf (clean only in 2019)"
 '' narendra modi kaa yah naaraa pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ke naare, ''du-hajaar unish / bijepi finnish'' (2019 main bhaajapa samaapt ho jaaegi)’’ ke jabaav main tha
 The crowd present there reacted with full vigor to Narendra Modi's slogan
 trinmul congress (tiemasi) ke netaaon se ajiz aa chuki, pashchim bengal kii 10 karod aabaadi ko ek aise netaa kii talash thi jo mamata banerjee kaa unheen ke andaaj main joardaar muqabla kar sake
 Such people believe that it is Narendra Modi who can rid West Bengal of the Trinamool Tolabaji tax of Didi (mamata Banerjee), under which people can get admission in college, or in government schools, among other things
 TMC has to pay to be reinstated as a teacher
 mamata banerjee ke damdaar pratidwandvi ke rup main narendra modi kii chhavi lagaataar majboot ho rahi thi
 He told the crowd, "the more you chant 'modi Modi' slogans, the more sleep disappears from his eyes
 ve gusse main baukhala kar mujhe gaaliyaan detii hai
 i have created the power to face Didi's wrath with the strength of the love of the people of Bengal
 ''satta virdohi lahar ke is mizaaj ko bhaanpate hue, bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne dedh saal pehle bengal ke vijay abhiyaan kii apni yojana banaai thi

 Amit Shah took all the right steps that he should have taken to gain big profits in West Bengal

 He believed that Bengal differs from the politics of caste and community like the Hindi belt and here the secular left ideology remains in effect

 "the anti-incumbency waves were rising so high that even in Bengal despite a quadrilateral political situation, the ground for a face-to-face fight between the TMC and the BJP was set," says Prashant Ray, a teacher and socialist at Presidency College, Kolkata

 "in the absence of a new leadership, the graph of the Left has been steadily declining since 2011 and there was confusion about the fact that the leftists had real Who is the enemy - Trinamool or BJP? And who is his friend, Congress or BJP? ”mamta Banerjee was not cursing any other party than BJP and thus she is largely responsible for political polarization this time
 uskaa parinaam kya hua? bhagava party ke vot share main ullekhneey vruddhi ho gai—saal 2014 main 17 fisadi se badhkar 2019 main bhaajapa kaa vot share 40 fisadi ho gaya
 Due to this polarization, TMC was seen as a party which was very soft on minority community while BJP projected itself as a party of majority Hindus
 ek hi manch se hindu shlokon or islamic siddhanton kaa paath karke mamata banerjee ne dharmanirpeksh dikhne kaa jo prayaas kiya vah kargar nahin rahaa
 At the same time, Muslims did not vote outright for TMC, but Bengal Hindus of the areas bordering Bangladesh remained united
 bhaajapa ke pradesh upaadhyaksh jai prakaash majumdaar kaa kahana he, ''is baar hamen kam se kam paanch se chah fisadi muslim vot bhi mili
 "narendra Modi's belief in granting Indian citizenship to Hindu refugees and preparing the National Register for Citizenship Rights gave the BJP a lead in 10-12 seats," says Mohit Ray, a former professor at Jadavpur University
 ''pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh dilip ghosh ko lagata he ki apane adhikaron ke prati sachet rahane kii aavashyaktaa jaruri ho gai he
 "the Chief Minister did not allow the Rath Yatra or the Sankalp Yatra and the helicopters of our leaders who came to the rallies did not land in Bengal, so they did dirty politics," he says
 '' haalanki, chunaav vishleshak yogendra yadav kehete hai, ''agar tiemasi 1960 ke dashak ke aakhir kii araajaktaa kii vaapasi kaa pratinidhitiv karti he, to bhaajapa kaa udai 1940 ke sampradayik narsanhaar ke daur kii vaapasi kaa sanket detaa he

 Meanwhile, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had locked herself in a room in her house in Kalighat
 ve khud ko sanyat karne ke liye synthesizer baja rahi thim or kavita likh rahi thim
 Now she has accepted the writing on the wall, but she will retaliate

 aise main behoshee kii dawa se ilaaj karne kii koshish main wo zamin par girane kii surat main or ghayal ho saktaa tha
 So with the help of trained elephants brought from Mysore, Siddha was captured from both sides

 ilaaj ke baad use jangal main chhod diya gaya tha
 But after a few days he came back to live in the water of Manchimbale Dam on the Arkavati River, about 45 km from Bengaluru
 wo lagaataar pani main rahata kyonki pani main vazan kam hone se pair par vazan kaam padataa or isse dard kam hota
 Also, the fish fishes would continuously eat the dead tissues around the wound, due to which the wound was also filling a little bit
 lekin uske pair kii sujan lagaataar bad rahi thi jo ki infections kii vajah se tha
 Siddha was pulled out of Mysore with the help of specially trained elephants

 isliye mysore se laaye gaye prashikshit haathiyon kii madad se siddha ko donon taraf se jakadaaa gaya

 The elderly woman Basanti was attacked with a knife after entering the house, in which she died

 The incident took place around 8 pm on Saturday night

 The elderly woman continued to suffer for a while and then succumbed
 vahiin, vaardaat ko anjaam dene ke baad hatyara faraar ho gaya
 By looking at the blood inside the house, it can be estimated how brutally the elderly woman was murdered
 jab basanti kaa betaa ghar aayaa, tab jaakar ghatana kaa khulaasa hua
 He was stunned by giving blood in the house
 jab usne aage nigaah daudai, to basanti farsh par khun se latapath padi mili
 After this, Basanti's son called and informed the police about the incident

 Expressing his disappointment over losing the first round of the men's doubles match with Rohan Bopanna, he expressed his disappointment that he has become a soft target and that is why people are falling behind him

 He said, "four years is a long time and you don't think that far
 is samay main niraash hum
 i did not get a chance to enjoy my seventh Olympic Games
 is umr main bhi khelte rahane ke liye aapako kaaphi kadi mehnat kerani padati he
 Paes admitted that some things remained incomplete in his Olympic career such as never winning a medal in doubles
 athens olympic main bronj medal se chukne kaa aaj bha afsos1996 olympic main kaansya padak jeetne vaale pes ne kaha, ‘jahaan tab olympic main yugal kii baat he, athens main jo hua vah dukhad tha
 It was not a happy moment
 ham ek samay match point par the, kaansya padak kaa match tha
 We needed a match point to win a medal but it did not happen and it is always in my mind
 ’ pes ne kaha, ‘ateet kii khubsuurati yah he ki aap use badal nahin sakate, aap usase bas sikh sakate hai

 If the Congress wants to show it by fighting elections in the name of Rajiv Gandhi
 or ab se kuch der pehle dilli main ek raily main rahul gandhi ne piem ko jawaab diya he
 Let me tell you that the Congress has already been enraged by PM Modi's statement of calling Rajiv Gandhi as corrupt number one
 party ne aaj isaki shikaayat chunaav ayog ko bhi kar di
 Congress says it is derogatory language
 is virodh main congress akeli nahin he
 Some of his potential allies are also extremely aggressive about this
 is hamale ne un dalon ko bhi congress ke paale main khadaa kar diya he jo abhi congress se duuri banaakar chal rahe hai jaise samaajawaadee paati or trinmul congress
 The controversy started over what PM Modi said about former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi

 Rahul Gandhi alleges corruption in French fighter aircraft Rafale getting offset contracts to Anil Ambani's company, while the Bofors case pertains to Bofors cannons purchased from Sweden during the Rajiv Gandhi government, in which the Swedish radio revealed that In this deal, the top leaders of India and some officials and middlemen were bribed

 to ab sawaal he ki kya rafel ke badale boforce kaa mudda uthaaya gaya he? kya chaukeedaar chor he ke congress ke naare kaa jawaab he bhrashtachari number 1? The second major cyber attack in the world, including India, within a month and a half has raised concerns
 is baar bhi ab tak sibar hamalavar kaa pataa nahin chal sakaa he
 Currently statistics are being collected about how many websites and computers were targeted by cyber attackers
 rus or ukraine se shuru hue is hamale ne duniya bhar ko apni chapet main le liya he
 The cyber attacker has also demanded a ransom
 sibar suraksha agenciyon kii maane, to petrap naam ke rancemaware virus ne vishwa kii badi 20 companiyon kii website ko apane kabje main le liya
 Since this cyber attack, questions are also arising as to which countries are not carrying out the insider attacks
 iske peeche aatankiyon ke haath hone kii bhi ashanka jataai ja rahi he
 In recent days, it has been seen that due to cyber hacking, relations between many countries have deteriorated
 america raashtrapati chunaav main hekking ke jariye dakhal dene kaa maamla saamne aayaa tha, jiskaa aarope rus par laga tha
 Due to this, relations between America and Russia deteriorated
 ise bhi padhieh duniya bhar main phir se bada sibar atake, mumbai kii JNPT samet 20 companiyon kii website haikadilachasp baat yah he ki ismencybar hamalaavarki pahchaan bhi nahin ho paati he
 Experts say that due to lack of identification of cyber attacker, one country can target the other only on the basis of apprehension
 aise main pratidwandi deshon ke bich katutaa teji se bad sakati he
 Many experts also say that the next world war will be fought online, which can be even more deadly than nuclear war
 america samet duniya ke shaktishaalee deshon ke parmaanu hathiyaar bhi dhare ke dhare rah jaaenge or haikar duniya ko chand secondon main tabah kar denge
 Currently, hacking is being attributed to the Qatar crisis and the tensions in the Gulf region
 aise main sibar suraksha duniya bhar ke liye chunauti he
 Even a powerful country like America could not counter-attack the US intelligence agencies after the presidential election, when Russia investigated the case, it was found that Russia had interfered in the US election and won Trump
 iske baad america ne apane yahaan se roosi rajanyikon ko nikaal diya, lekin tab tak kaaphi der ho chuki thi
 Even the world's most powerful country like America could not save itself from this cyber attack nor could retaliate
 12 may ko britain ke darjanon aspataalon ke computer ko haikaron ne ranjamaware ke jariye hack kar liya gaya tha
 99 countries had come under the grip of this biggest cyber attack, but till date the attacker did not have any temper
 sibar hamale ne loktantr ke astitv ke liye bhi khatra paidaa kar diya he
 India is also vulnerable to cyber attack

 islamabad main hone vaala 19wein saarc sammelan radd ho gaya he
 According to the exclusive information received from sources in Kathmandu, Aaj Tak has decided to cancel the SAARC conference
 is bare main aupchaarik elaan thodi der main hone kii ummid he
 India as well as neighboring Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan have decided to boycott the conference

 Nepal is considering changing the venue from Islamabad to another place for this conference to be held in November
 uri aatanki hamale ke baad modi sarkaar nepakistanko alag-thalag karne kii disha main kootneeti ke morche par bada faisla liya he
 After the arrival of three more neighboring countries in support of this decision of India, this group of 8 countries of South Asia is now left with Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives
 haalanki bharat ke faisle ko durbhagyapurna qaraar dete hue pakistani videsh mantralay ne bharat par pakistan main aatankwaad ko badhaava dene kaa aarope laga diya
 'radio Pakistan' has quoted Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria as saying that despite the boycott of 4 countries including India, Pakistan will hold the SAARC conference
 haalanki, aisa mumkin nahin he
 Know, what will be the impact of India's bicot? India is the largest member of this group formed in 1985
 agar bharat or teen anya sadsy is sammelan main nahin jaaenge to iske aayojan par bhi sankat ke badal chaa gaye hai
 According to the new rules, the presence of all the member countries in the conference is necessary, otherwise the event will have to be postponed or canceled
 1985 ke baad ye pehla mauka hoga jab bharat ne saarc sammelan kaa bycott karne kaa faisla liya he
 Due to India not going to this conference, all the preparations for the event will be taken away
 srilanka ne kah diya he ki bharat kii bhagidaari ke bagaiyr saarc sammelan mumkin nahin he
 India's move to support four other member countries means that India is maintaining a strong diplomatic hold in South Asia
 afghanistan or bangladesh to khud bhi aatankwaad se jujh rahe hai, lekin bhutan or srilanka jaise chote deshon kaa bharat ke saath khadaa hona bharat kii takat ko dikhaata he
 The SAARC economy is the third largest economy in the world by GDP
 saarc ke sadsy desh duniya ke teen fisadi daayre main faile hue hai or duniya kii puri aabaadi kaa kareeb 21 fisadi hissaa in deshon main rahata he
 In these eight countries, India's area and population is more than 70 percent
 2005-10 ke dauraan saarc kii ausat jidipi growth rate 8
 8 per cent per annum but in 2011 it decreased to 6
 5 fisadi rah gai
 This was the effect of the economic slowdown in India as India accounts for about 80% of the total economy of SAARC
 saarc sammelan ke radd hone se pakistan ko saarvajanik taur par kootnithik sharmindagi hogi
 The message has been sent to Pakistan that it has been isolated by cultivating terror
 afghanistan, bhutan, bangladesh ne pakistan ke khilaaf bharat ke tarkon ko vajan diya he
 Isolation of Pakistan on the issue of terrorism will also send a message to the international community
 kyonki saarc main hi america sahit 7 bade desh or ek bada sanghathan obzarwar ke taur par he
 In the coming days, Pakistan will fear to become more isolated at the diplomatic level

 Scenes of the film Mimi on Bollywood actors Pankaj Tripathi and Kriti Sanon were being shot in Churu, but no permission was taken from any officer in this regard
 is kaaran ye kaarywahi kerani padi
 The first schedule of the film Mimi has started from Rajasthan

 desh ke paanch rajyon ke chunavi nateezon main bijepi ko tagada jhatka laga he
 Whereas the Congress got a living with the election results
 madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh bijepi ke haathon se nikalakar congress shasit rajya main tabdeel ho gaye hai
 It is clear from the results that in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi may face a tough challenge to return to power
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii satta kii chaabi paanch rajyon ke paas hogi
 These include Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Bihar and Tamil Nadu
 desh ke ye aise paanch rajya hai, jahaan sabase zyada loksabhaa siten hai
 These states have a total of 249 parliamentary seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi gathbandhan ko 148 siten mili thim
 While the Congress had got only 10 seats and others had 91 seats
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ek baar phir najar inhen paanch rajyon par hogi
 After the results of the assembly elections, it is believed that the political picture of these states may change
 bijepi ke liye jahaan chunautiyaan khadi ho rahi hai, vahiin congress ke liye sambhaavnaaen banati dikh rahi hai
 Answer: Narendra Modi's entire legacy rests on Uttar Pradesh
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi upi kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se 71 jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Apart from this, 2 seats were won by Apna Dal, an ally of BJP
 is tarah se endie ko 73 siten mili thim
 While Congress got 2 seats and SP got five seats
 iske alaava 2017 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bijepi aitihaasik jeet hasil karke satta par virajman hui thi
 It is now believed that in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the SP-BSP and the Congress can join the electoral fray
 inke aane se bijepi kaa sameekaran bighad saktaa he
 Recently, by-elections have been held in three Lok Sabha seats of the state and BJP has lost all three seats
 aise main 2014 jaise nattejey 2019 main doharaana bijepi ke liye aasaan nahin he
 While the SP-BSP and Congress alliance are looking forward to increasing the number of seats
 maharashtra2019 main narendra modi kii vaapasi main maharashtra kii ahm bhoomika rahegi
 Maharashtra has a total of 48 Lok Sabha seats
 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ko 23 or uski sahyogi shivasena ko 18 siten mili thi
 While the Congress was reduced to 2 and NCP 4 seats
 vahiin, ek seat swabhimaan paksh ko gai thi
 Let us know that the relationship between Shiv Sena and BJP is also seen as estrangement
 donon dal 2019 main alag-alag chunaav ladane ke sanket de chuke hai
 While Congress and NCP are talking about contesting elections together
 aise main 2014 loksabhaa chunaav jaise nattejey bijepi ke liye aasaan nahin dikh rahe hai
 While the opposition is expected to grow
 bihar2019 main bihar bhi kaaphi mahatvapurn bhoomika hogi
 Bihar has a total of 40 assembly seats
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko 22 or uske sahyogi algepi 6 or araspi ko 3 siten mili thi
 However, now the RLSP broke away from the NDA
 vahiin, jediu ek baar phir endie kaa hissaa ban chuki he
 BJP will contest 17 seats as compared to last election
 aise main chunaav se pehle hi uski siten ghat gai hai
 At the same time, Congress and RJD are together
 tejasvi yadav ke netritv main argedy kaa graph badha he
 The results of such assembly elections have given life to the Congress
 aise main congress-argedy gathbandhan ko ummiden najar aa raheen

 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ko mahaj 2 siten mili thi
 While TMC had 34 seats in its account
 bijepi kaa graph rajya main badha he or duusare number kii party ban gai he
 The BJP has a target of 22 seats, but TMC is talking about entering the electoral fray with the opposition parties
 aise main agar vipaksh ekajute hota he to phir bijepi ko apane target puraa karne kii badi chunauti hogi
 Tamil Nadu is also an important state in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 pradesh main kul 39 loksabhaa siten he
 AIADMK won 37 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 jabaki bijepi ko ek seat mili thi

 lekin ascharyajanak rup se uphaaron ke saath 'khadi' se ghar aane waalon ke swaagat main airport aane vaale rishtedaaron kii ankhon main ab pehle vaali khushi kii chamak nahin dikhti
 In fact, it is not a happy occasion for many people
 nikasi dwaar se airport se baahar aa rahe kai log to shaayad airport se antim baar nikaas dwaar se baahar aa rahe hai
 They will now rarely return to this airport from the entrance
 yahaan tak ki taxi chaalak bhi ab un yatriyon ke peeche nahin bhaag rahe kyonki unhen pataa he ki inamen se bahut-se log to shaayad taxi kaa kiraaya chukaane kii haalat main bhi nahin honge
 Relatives are moving towards visitors
 taxi chaalak mohammad hakim kehete hai, ''unke latake hue chehre sari kahani bayaan kar dete hai
 No one wants to be told that he no longer has a 'job'
 ham pichley kuch maheenon main badi sankhya main aise logon ko aate hue dekh rahe hai jo shaayad waapas laut ke nahin jaaenge
 Many of them now use public transport to get to their homes

 Those who come back join the group of people who have returned from the Gulf empty-handed
 barason tak, kuch ke liye to kai dashakon tak, marubhumi main mulajmat baad bhi bachat ke naam par kuch nahin he
 The Muslim-majority Malappuram district of northern Kerala, which accounts for one-fifth of the total population from the state to the Gulf countries, is the worst affected
 chamak kho rahe 'enarai gaanv'malappuram jile ke puthuparkvabu gaanv ke mehalon jaise ghar or gaganchumbi vyavsaayik imaaraten, yahaan se hue pravaas kii safalataa kii kahani kahati hai
 Panchayats like Adarikode have at least two people from every household working in the Gulf
 lekin jaisaa ki kerala ke kai anya hisson main bhi dekha ja rahaa he, in gaanvon main sthiti ab badal gai he
 In Kerala, the discussion now is of 'returned from the Gulf' or reverse migration
 har din bharat aane vaali hawaii udaanen unamem se zyaadaatar ko hameshaa ke liye apane ghar waapas lekar aa rahi hai
 The increase in their numbers in the last four years indicates that Kerala, from where most people had migrated to Arab countries for several decades, is now witnessing the 'end of the Gulf journey'
 uttar main malappuram tathaa kosicode or dakshin main kollam sabase zyada prabhavit jile hai
 50 percent of those who come back are from these districts
 janvari 2019 main jari kerala kaa apravas survey bataata he ki rajya ke lagbhag 18
 9 million people are working in Gulf countries, 89 of the state's total migrants
 2 pratishat he
 The Gulf countries have been a favorite place of people of Kerala since the 1960s
 is dashak main kerala ne ek ke baad ek, kai akaal jhele the or halaat achche nahin the
 There were very few jobs and there was a huge shortage of money
 shuru main to bahut se garib pravasi bina passport ke hi apni jaan ko jokhim main daalkar naav main baithkar hi sagar paar karke khadi deshon main pahunch gaye
 Those journeys are now part of folklore and the money sent by these migrants has saved Kerala from many crises for a long time
 lekin pichley ek dashak se logon kaa khadi deshon main jane kaa aakarshan lagaataar ghat rahaa he
 The number of Malayali migrants has come down drastically
 2013 main sthaneey logon ke liye naukariyon ko sunishchit karne ke liye saudi arab main rashtriyakaran yojana 'nitakat' lagu hui jisaki vajah se baahar ke log teji se naukariyaan ganvaane lage
 The number of those returning to Kerala since then 11
 6 pratishat kii nakaaratmak pravriti dikhi he
 Saudi Arabia tops the list of countries from which reverse migration is taking place in Kerala today, followed by UAE
 puthuparambu ke 61 varshiya mohammad kanhiracoden kehete hai, ''saudi arab main sthiti bad se badtar hoti ja rahi he
 i left Saudi Arabia in July 2017 and i did not receive my salary for several months
 or yah haalat lagbhag 16 varshon tak jedda main kaam karne ke baad kii he
 "could not even finish school, Muhammad used to make kubus (bread) in a food factory at a salary of 1600 Saudi riyals (rs 28,800)

 maine apni kamai se ek acha ghar banaaya or apni beti kii shaadi kii
 However, now the 'gulf Return' is of no great benefit to him because his savings have been modest even over so many years
 is par unhen ghutane kaa pratyaropan karana padaa or ab ve karj ke jaal main funs gaye hai
 Naushad Othupalli, a village social worker, says that this is the new reality of the 'gulf lover Malabar'
 naushaad aise halaat ke liye rajya ke niti nirmaataaon ko jimmedaar tehraate hue kehete hai, ''khadi deshon main chijen kaaphi teji se badal rahi hai or unki arthvyavasthaaen dabaav main hai
 Now those countries are no longer a guarantee of a better life for our people
 agar hamane khadi se lautakar aae logon ke punarvaas yaa uske prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye paryaapt kadam nahin uthaae to yah badi samasya banane vaali he kyonki bade paimaane par logon ke lautne se kerala main saamaajik ashaanti badaae vaali he
 "kerala has very few opportunities for semi-skilled workers returning from the Gulf
" naushaad kehete hai, ''in logon main se adhikansh vahaan amanviya paristhitiyon main kaam karte rahe hai or jab ve lautate hai to avsaad main dub jate hai or sehat se judi duusari samasyaayein paidaa ho jaati hai
 Most of them do not even have any advice on how they can develop their skills
 rajya ko unke punarvaas ke liye bhi usee tarah ke kaarykram banane honge jaisaa ki purv sainikon ke liye hota he
 Despite coming from the "NRI family", 34-year-old Naushad never wished to work in the Gulf
 2003 main ghar lautne se pehle unke pita kundahamad ne 17 saal tak saudi arab main kaam kiya
 Naushad finally took a passport in March 2018, when his friends created a lot of pressure to come to the Gulf
 haalanki ab bhi khadi kii unki pehali yatra honi baaki hi he
