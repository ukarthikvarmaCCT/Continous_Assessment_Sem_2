 in Team India fast bowler Umesh Yadav has made a big disclosure after seven years of making a move in international cricket
 unka kahana he ki jab 20 varsh kii umr main pratham shrenee cricket main unhone aagaaj kiya tha, to unhen laal rang kii esji test gend se khilne kaa andaja nahin tha
 Umesh Yadav, who has played 33 Tests and 70 odis so far, told 'bcci
com', 'you have been playing cricket since childhood
 to aapako khel ke bare main kaaphi chijen pataa chal jaati hai
 But if you are suddenly asked to do something different, it can be difficult for you
 'test main 92 or vanade main 98 wicket hasil kar chuke is pesar ne kaha, 'maine tennis or rabad kii gend se khelnaa shuru kiya or jab tak main 20 saal kaa nahin ho gaya, tab tak maine cricket main aamtaur par istemaal kii jaani vaali gend nahin pakadi thi
 It was too late for a fast bowler
 isliye jab aisa hua, to mujhe nahin pataa tha ki is gend se kya karun
 'and it took him nearly two years to figure out how to bowl with it
 unhone kaha, ‘main nahin jaanata tha ki gend ko kahaan pich karun, pehle do varshon main main yah nahin samaj sakaa ki kab gend baahar jaaegi or kab yah andar yaa phir sidhi jaaegi
 Umesh has silenced critics who have been critical of his line and length many times over his performance of the past 12 months
 itani aalochanaon ke baavjood is 29 varshiya gendbaaj ne apni raftaar se samjhauta nahin kiya
 He said, 'I always wanted to bowl fast
 jaise-jaise main bada hua, maine tej gendbaaji ke bare main kaaphi chijen sikhin
 The place i come from is not famous for producing fast bowlers
 ’ yadav ne kaha, ‘main jaanata tha ki aise kai gendbaaj the, jo 130-135 kimi prati ghante kii raftaar se gendbaaji karte the
 i knew that if you do every ball at a speed of 140 kmph, then only you can do something different and only then you can get a chance

 ' The woman said that she had filed a rape complaint against Kataria on December 11, 2015 at the Mahila police station here, but she alleged that the police refused to register a case

 ' The results of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections came on 11 March and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh was in the lead in the race for the Chief Minister till 15 March
 jab rajnath singh se poocha gaya ki kya vah uttar pradesh ke nae mukhyamantri banane ja rahe hai to unka do took kahana he- sab bakawaas kii baat hai
 Now, to take the meaning of this reaction of Rajnath Singh, two things are clear, first, he was never in the race of Chief Minister and secondly if his name was included in this race, then he himself does not want to hold this post
 duusari sambhaavna ko sach maan liya jaae to sawaal uthta he ki aakhir kyon rajya ke mukhyamantri pad ko pehle sambhaal chuke rajnath singh ab kendra main grih mantri ke pad ko chhodkar dobaaraa mukhyamantri nahin bananaa chaahate?1
 Rajnath Singh, a 15-year-old politician, was the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh from 2000 to 2002
 iske baad 2003 se 2004 tak vah atal bihari vaajapai kii kendra sarkaar main krishi mantri bane
 Again, playing an important role in the national politics of BJP between 2004 and 2014, Rajnath Singh once again was the BJP President before the 2014 elections but in the general elections, Sehran Narendra Modi and Amit Shah's head was tied and he got the post of Prime Minister by the Central Government
 The most important position was given to the Home Minister
 ab grih mantri kaa pad chhodkar waapas kisi rajya kaa mukhyamantri bananaa rajnath singh ke liye 15 saal puraani raajnneeti main kadam rakhane jaisaa hoga
 2
 pehle mukhyamantri zyada taqatvar thauttar pradesh main beete do dashakon se samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party kii sarkarein bani hai
 This period was when the Chief Minister of the state was one of the most powerful Chief Ministers in the country
 isi takat ke chalate samay-samay par samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party se mulaayam singh or mayawati ne kendra kii sattarudh party ko apni takat kaa parichay diya he
 But now there is a BJP government at the center and the BJP is going to be formed in the state
 jaahir he kendra or rajya main ek dal hone ke kaaran ab uttar pradesh kaa mukhyamantri party ke saath-saath rashtriya raajnneeti main vah rutaba nahin rakhega jo kendra sarkaar ke grih mantri kaa hota he
 3
 kendra kii raajnneeti main demoshanrajnath singh ne 1984 main upi bijepi ke youth wing ke adhyaksh pad ke saath raajnneetik safar kii shuruyaat karte hue 2000 main pradesh ke mukhyamantri pad ko paa liya
 He then joined the party's central government in 2003 as a cabinet minister
 iske baad rajnath singh ne 2006 se 2009 tak bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh rahe
 The special thing is that before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, in 2013, Rajneeth Singh again became the president of the party and the party led by him overthrew the Congress and formed the Narendra Modi government
 rashtriya raajnneeti main yah mukaam hasil kar lene ke baad ab kisi rajya kaa mukhyamantri bananaa rajnath singh ke liye kisi demoshan se kam nahin
 4
 bataur mukhyamantri sara shrey modi ko milegautar pradesh kii maujuuda raajnneeti behad ahm he
 In 2014, the state elected BJP on 71 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats
 ise modi lahar kaa sabase saaf sanket mana gaya
 Once again in 2017, BJP has got 312 seats in the 403-member assembly
 yah jeet bhi modi lahar ke naam kii ja chuki he
 Therefore, the new Chief Minister of the state will face a very tough challenge
 kyonki ek baat saaf he ki bataur mukhyamantri pradesh main prayek vifaltaa kaa jimmedaar vah khud hoga or vahiin prayek safalataa ke shrey sidhe pradhanmantri ke naam darj hota rahegaa
 5
 kaanto bharaa taj he upi kii kursiuttar pradesh kemukhyamantri kii kursijitani ahm he utani hi mushkilon se bhari hui bhi he

 in / For a young child, the mother is his world
 wo maa kii najar se sabakuch samajhataa or sikhta he
 If someone scolds, he seeks the mother's lap
 khush hota he to bhagkar maa ke gale lag jaataa he
 The truth is, no one can love pure love like a mother
 aaj (13 may) madars de he
 As such, no day can be set for the mother, but if the day is fixed then something must be done
 zyaadaatar log maa ko paise dekar sochate hai ki kartavya puraa ho gaya, lekin dost maa ko rupaya-paisa nahin chahie
 The wealth of the whole world will be reduced in calculating the mother
 maa ko iske sivaay kuch nahin chahie ki uski santan sukhi rahe
 That is why Munawar says that this is a loan that i cannot pay, my mother stays in punishment till i return home
 
 
 aap maa ke bina apane ghar kii kalpana nahin kar sakate hai
 If all the things are found in place, then it is the hard work of the mother
 agar aap kuch karnaa chaahate hai to maa ke upar se ghar kaa boj kam kiijie
 Let's know the 5 ways that you can help your mother
 1- ab aap bade ho gaye hai or apana khyaal khud rakh sakate hai
 It is very wrong to depend on the mother for small things
 aapako apane kapadon, kamare or chizon kii dekhbhaal swayan kerani chahie
 2- If the mother is doing some household work, it is not because it is her job, but because you people do not have any problem
 isliye jab bhi maa ko koi kaam karte dekhen unki madad karen
 If possible, share your work
 kichan ke kaam main bhi haath bantaayen
 Your child's mind will be sharp, feed this thing 3- We all take a day or two off from our office, but is the mother's week off? off course not
 bahut pyaara hoga agar parivaar vaale milakar maa ke liye ek din kii chuttee tay kar den
 4
 Whenever the mother calls, go immediately to help them
 agar unako jarurat naa hoti to wo pukaarti hi nahin
 Therefore, if the mother calls, leave all work and go for help
 railway mahilaon ke dibbe ko train ke bich main rakhega, milengi kai suvidhaayen5- jab bhi khaanaa khaaen apane bartan ko dhokar hi rakhen, ye choti lekin bahut kaam kii baat he, isse aap anjaane main hi maa kii bahut madad kar rahe honge
 If possible, leave the mother completely from the housework
 unke saath ghoomane jaaen or baahar khaanaa khaane jaaen
 Mother has done her duty, now it's your turn

 munjaal ne kaha ki cycle kii financing ke liye vichaar yah he ki ise har us aadmi ko uplabdh karana he, jisaki masik aay utpaada kii keemat se kam he
 He said that the monthly income of a villager can be up to Rs 2,500, but in the absence of any financing scheme, he cannot spend Rs 3,000 to buy a bicycle
 financing ke jariye ham un tak yah utpaada pahunchaana chaahate hai

 ab yahaan sawaal yah uth rahaa he ki aakhir rajeev kumaar koun hai, jinke liye trinmul congress (TMC) adhyaksh mamata banerjee puri raat dharne par baithi raheen
 After all, who is Rajiv Kumar, Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar is considered to be highly trusted by Mamta Banerjee
 unako saal 2016 main surajeet kar purkysth kii jagah kolkata kaa police kamishnar banaaya gaya tha
 At the same time Purkayastha was promoted and sent to CID department

 They work 24 hours
 ' unhone bijepi par jhooth failaane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki jhooth hameshaa jhooth hi rahata he
 During this, Mamta tweeted and accused the BJP leadership of doing cheap politics
 unhone kaha ki bijepi netritv na sirf raajnneetik partiyon ko hi nishaanaa bana rahaa he, balki wo police ko niyantran main lene or sabhi sanvaidhanik sansthaanon ko nasht karne ke liye power kaa galat istemaal bhi kar rahaa he
 We strongly condemn this
 uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti main mohammad ajam khan wo naam he, jiskaa jaadu har mausam main chalata he
 Azam Khan, who is running at the 70th stage of his age, has done more than four decades of electoral politics and in this period only one such occasion has come when Awam has not chosen Azam
 yahaan tak ki modi lahar, yogi lahar or modi tsunami main bhi rampur main ajam khan kii majboot neenv ko hilaa nahin saki
 In the current Lok Sabha election, Azam Khan defeated BJP candidate Jaya Prada
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan donon netaaon ke bich puraani adaavat ko lekar jamkar tikhi bayaanbaji hui
 Even her election campaign was banned for one of Azam Khan's remarks on Jaya Prada and Jaya Prada made women's honor an important issue against Azam Khan
 lekin in tamaam vivaadon or upi main phir modi tsunami ke baavjood ajam khan apni seat achche margin se jeet gaye
 Azam Khan received 5,59,177 votes, while Jaya Prada's count stayed at 4,49,180 votes
 is tarah ajam khan ne 1,09,997 maton se jaya pradaa ko haraa diya
 Azam Khan's victory with a good margin has come in those situations when the BJP along with the whole country has gained unilateral public support in UP and all the anti-party parties have collapsed
 yahaan tak ki ajam khan kii party sapa bhi mahaj 5 siton par jeet saki he or mulaayam singh va akhilesh yadav ke alaava parivaar se dimple yadav, dharmendra yadav or akshay yadav tak chunaav haar gaye hai
 This is not the first time Azam Khan has managed to save his fort despite the defeat of the entire party
 bete abdulla ajam ke saath ajam khanisse pehle 2017 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav main bhi aise hi halaat dekhne ko mili the
 Azam Khan, who has been doing UP assembly politics since 1980, also contested the 2017 election from Rampur

 unhone gelbaro andolan ke liye 12 april kii tithi kii ghoshnaa kii or baad main use badalakar 13 april kar diya

 Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal was supposed to have a meeting with social workers Swami Agnivesh and Arvind Kejriwal on Friday morning but the meeting did not take place and both sides said they kept on waiting for each other
 uske baad hajaare ne yah ghoshnaa kii
 Rejecting both these demands of social workers, Sibal also said that only government officials will be members of the drafting committee of the Lokpal Bill and secondly, if civil society presses for the post of president, no minister will be a part of it
 unhone kaha, ‘sanyukt samiti ke gathan par koi sarkari adhisuchana jari kiye jane kii sambhaavna nahin he lekin hamane unase kaha he ki ham kanoon mantralay ke madhyam se sarkari patr dene or press note jari karne ko icchhuk hai
 Hazare also appealed to the unemployed youths to participate in this movement and said that they would get breakfast and two meals a day in jail
 unhone kaha ki unka andolan satta kaa logon ke haathon vikendrikaran ke liye he or prastaavit lokapal vidheyak us disha main ek aglaa kadam he

 Hazare said that corruption in this country can be stopped if the agencies engaged in the struggle against this disease are brought under the Lokpal instead of the government
 unhone kaha, ‘sibiai, satarkta samitiyaan yaa anya samitiyaan aadi jinase bhrashtachar ke rokthaam kii aashaa kii jaati he ve sarkaar ke antargat hai
 Since they have been functioning under the government, corruption has not stopped
 ’hajaare ne kaha, ‘‘boforce ke pehle or baad main sibiai ne kai bade maamalon kii jaanch kii
 But has any minister or IAS or IPS officer been jailed till now
 aisa isliye hota he kyonki yadi koi kadi karrwai karnaa bhi chahta he to sarkaar use roak detii he
 "he said," The agencies responsible for the control of corruption, which are under the government, if brought under the Lokpal, the corrupt people will go to jail, that is why we are demanding such Lokpal
 ’gandhivadi netaa ne soochna kaa adhikaar kanoon kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki is kanoon ne baari badlaav laayaa he or sarkaar ko niyamon kaa paalan karnaa hoga tathaa britain ne ‘niyam keval logon ke liye or niyantran sarkaar kaa’ kii jo vyavastha di thi vah palat jayega
 He said, 'today there are two reasons why corruption in the country has lifted its head
 pehla, kanoon itane kamjor hai ki bhrasht vyaktiyon ko unka koi dar nahin hota
 Second, many people who run the government are taking these corrupt people along
 ’hajaare ne kaha, ‘ek teesraa kaaran bhi he ki satta kaa vikendrikaran nahin hua
 Corruption raises its head because power is concentrated in the government
 lokapal vidheyak (satta ke) vikendrikaran ke liye he or hamaara andolan usee ke liye he
 Swami Agnivesh, a social worker sitting on stage with Hazare, looked hopeful for the solution
 agnivesh ne kaha, ‘main ise takaraav ke rup main nahin dekhnaa chahta
 Absolutely not
 sibbal bahut hi sulah vaale vyakti hai or unhone mujhase phone par baat kii he or vah vah maamla yathashighra jald suljhaana chaahate hai
 Hopefully, the matter will be resolved by the evening

 It is important to provide a durable and effective image to the Congress-led front, with a narrow margin of majority
 lihaaja, udief main soch yah he ki mantrimandal ke gathan main der karnaa vivekpurna nahin hoga
 Indications are that the main front ally of the 20-member cabinet will get 10 seats including the chief minister
 morche ke duusare sabase bade dal ko chaar or kerala congress (em) ko teen mantri pad milenge

 In which the Congress blamed the BJP of the Center and the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi for the ceiling
 congress kaa aarope he ki ceiling ke liye dilli or centre sarkarein donon jimmedaar hai
 Due to the manner in which sealing is being done on industrial units in Delhi, there is a lot of resentment among the businessmen, Congress is now seen to surround the Center and Delhi Government on the issue of ceiling as well as rising inflation and unemployment
 bavana main hui is raily main congress ne petrol kii badhati keemton ke liye centre sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya saath hi dilli main aam aadmi party kii ore se chunaavon se pehle paanch lakh rojgaar dene kii baat par dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ko aade haathon liya
 Congress state president Ajay Maken targeted the center through this rally and said that on this issue in the year 2007 when the Congress government was at the center, the law was brought in Parliament
 lekin ab centre sarkaar is masale par kuch nahin kar rahi he
 Ajay Maken also said that people are constantly alleging that there is a lot of corruption under the guise of the monitoring committee regarding sealing, so the monitoring committee should take cognizance and get the matter investigated
 ceiling ke khilaaf chal rahe nyaay yuddh ke sanyojak va congress netaa mukesh sharma ne kaha ki dilli nagar nigam or dilli sarkaar dwaara dukaanon va audyogic ikaiyon ko gaiyr-kanoonee tareeke se sil kiye jane ke khilaaf dilli ke logon kaa gussa lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he

 jane maane itihaaskaar or lekhak ramchandra guha ne kaha he bharat main ucch str kii mul chintanashiltaa kii satat raajnneetik parampara rahi he evam usne maanav sthiti ke har pahalu ko chhua he lekin ab ise behaal karne or aaj se sandarbh main praasangik banane ke liye kaaphi kuch kiye jane kii jarurat he
 Guha said, 'india can be a unique country in terms of original politics and long tradition of reflective thinking which has always been of high standard and touched every aspect of human condition
 ’ kal raat yahaan ‘bhartiya raajnneetik parampara-or ve log jinhone isaki neenv daali’ vishay par chauthe penguin bharat vyaakhyaan main apane sambodhan main unhone kaha ki vishaal bharat kii avadharana kaa shrey un purushon or mahilaon ko jaataa he jinhone bhartiya raajnneetik parampara kii neenv rakhi or use sinchaa
 This topic of the lecture was based on Guha's new book 'creator of Modern India'
 apni pustak kii bhaanti hi guha ne samaaj sudhaarak rajamohan raay se shuru kiya or unhone bharat kaa pehla aadhunik or udaaravaadi bataaya jo chintak, saamaajik abhinayta, vidwaan evam saamaajik sudhaarak the evam jinhone pashchimi vichaardhaara se kattarpanthi or kathor saamaajik dhaancha kaa saamana kiya
 Guha said that unlike today the makers of the Indian political tradition had original, influential and relevant things to say about democracy, nationalism, economic policy, religion, gender, caste, environment and India's relationship with the world
 mahatma gandhi, rabindranath tagore, jawahar laal nehru, jaiprakash narayan, em es golwalkar or ram manohar lohia kaa udhaaharan dete hue unhone kaha, ‘bharat ke raajnneetik samaaj kaa koi bhi rajaneta yaa samaaj sudhaarak unki tarah ab nahin sochataa
 What we need to worry about is not that we do not have a reflective politician but the leaders of today who claim themselves to be followers but they do not know about them
 ’ itihaaskaar ne savaaliye lahaze main kaha ki kya congress saansad rahul gandhi ne jawahar laal nehru dwaara mukhyamantriyon ko likhe patr kabhi padhaa, kya bahujan samaaj party pramukh mayawati ne kabhi ambedkar ke bhaashan padhe yaa kya samaajawaadee party mulaayam singh yadav ne lohia kii likhi koi kitaab padhi
 He said that many other world leaders also share the same situation
 haalanki is maamle main unhone america raashtrapati baraak obama kii prashansa kii
 Guha said, Gandhi and Nehru confronted them with their ideology different from the thinking of the people and they spoke with their utmost vigorously
 enie yani neshnal investegative agency kediespi tanzeel ahmedke sansanikhej katl kaa raaj khul chukaa he
 Neither a terrorist or terrorist organization was behind the killing of Tanjil Ahmed nor had anything to do with the investigation of any case related to his profession or profession
 balki tanzeel ahamed ke katl kii vajah rishtedaaron se dushmani, paisa or praparty he
 They were murdered by their own people
 enie ke ek dspi ko 24 goliyaan maari jaati hai
 By morning, the news spreads like a fire across the country
 jitne munh utani baaten
 Some relate this murder to a terrorist incident and another to another module of the terror group
 koi ye kahata he ki chunki tanzeel aatankwaadiyon ke network ke peeche pade the usee kaa badla he ye
 So someone said that Tanjil was on a very intelligence mission in the NIA and probably because of that he was targeted
 lekin sari baaten bas baaten hi nikaleen
 Truth turned out to be something else
 cash vine lut kaa kya he conection?saare iljaamon se bada ek iljaam tanzeel ahamed par aisa bhi he jise philhal police naa nakaar rahi he or naa sweekaar rahi he
 And this serious charge is that the Munir, who was Tanjil Ahmed Kogoli Mariusi Munir, looted Rs 91 lakh from a cash van of a bank four months ago
 kya lut kii us rakam se tanzeel kaa koi lenaa-dena tha? aiji ke mutabik, lut kii rakam ke bare main abhi jaanch jari he
 The real culprit is far from the grip of the police, the NIA, ATS, STF, local police all together kept on talking for several days
 har angel ko khangaal daalaa
 But finally the truth has been revealed
 lekin kya sach puraa he? yaa police ab bhi aadha sach bataa rahi he or aadha chupa rahi he? dspi tanzeel ahamed ke katl ke silsile main philhal police ne do logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Ryan and Jeannie
 katl or katl ke makasad kii ab tak kii sari kahani inhen donon ne sunai he
 After hearing his story, the police told his story to the media
 magar is katl se judaa teesraa balki yun kahen ki sabase ahm kirdaar yani munir ab bhi police kii giraft se dur he
 Munir means the mastermind of the loot of 91 lakh rupees
 to kya baaki kii aadhi kahani munir ke saamne aane ke baad hi saamne aegi?itani goliyaan maarin ki bachane kaa mauka na milipulice ke mutabik, dspi tanzeel ahamed ke katl ke do ahm kirdaar hai
 One Ryan and the other Munir
 katl vaali raat reyaan bike chalaa rahaa tha
 While sitting on the back of the bike, Munir shot 24 bullets from Tanjeel Ahmed
 tanzeel ahamed reyaan ke chachaa ke bahanoi the
 Actually, hatred and enmity between the family started with Tanzil Ahmed and Ryan's relationship
 or isaki vajah thi paisa or praparty
 The sensational manner in which the murder of NIA DSP Muhammad Tanjil Ahmad is rarely seen
 ek aisa katl, jisamen dushman naa sirf apane shikaar kaa lambey vakt tak peechha karte rahe balki mauka milte hi ek saath itani goliyaan daag deen ki bachane kii koi gunjaaish hi nahin bachi
 Tanjil's wife was also shot, admitted to hospital and NIA DSP Muhammad Tanjil was returning from a wedding with his family in Bijnor on the night of 3 April
 tabhi bike par savaar reyaan or munir ne bich raste main unki car ko overtek kar unka rasta roka or andhadhundh goliyaan chalaani shuru kar deen
 Apart from Tanjil, his wife was also hit, who is still admitted in the hospital in a very serious condition
 is katl ke chashmadid tanzeel ke do bachche bhi the jo us vakt car main hi the
 The first clue in this high profile murder case was found by the police from the 9 mm pistol from which Tanjil Ahmed was shot
 aiji ne bataaya ki lakhanu farensik main jaanch ke baad yah saaf hua he ki lut or katl main istemaal kiya gaya khokha ek hi tha
 After this, it was clear that there was no relation with the terrorist network or his profession with the murder of Tanjil
 balki ye aapasi ranjish kaa nateeja he
 Because by then the police had picked up Tanjil's relative Ryan and had told him everything
 katl kii vajah bhi
 This was the motive behind the murder, the brother-in-law of Ahmed Rayan's uncle
 reyaan kii buaa or foofa kaa dilli ke ranjit nagar main padosi se jhagada ho gaya tha
 He sought help from Tanjeel after the police filed a case
 tanzeel ahamed ne madad nahin kii jisaki vajah se buaa or foofa do din jail main rahe
 Rayan's uncle's four-storey house in Okhla was taken by Tanjil Ahmed
 makaan ke badale ek dukaan diya
 But the price of the shop was cheaper than the house
 reyaan ke pita ke mausere bhai kaa ek karod rupye ek praparty dealer ke paas fansaa tha
 Tanjil also sought help in this matter
 magar tanzeel ne madad karne kii bajaae usee praparty dealer ke saath apane mumer bhai kii partnerashi kara di
 Taniel is accused of stealing mobile by Ryan's aunt
 in sab baton se reyaan tanzeel se naaraaz tha
 This is because of Ryan's displeasure with Tanjeel Ahmed
 police kii maane to wo reyaan hi tha jisane munir kotanzil ke khilaafaukasaaya tha or usee ke baad tanzeel ko raste se hataane kaa plan bana
 But the question is why was Munir angry with Tanjil? What was Tanjil's relationship with the Munir whom the police had been looking for since 2013? So the reason for Munir's displeasure with Tanjeel Ahmed was something else
 upi police kaa ek or bada khulhasadspi tanzeel ahamed ke katl kaa khulaasa karte hue upi police ne ek or sansanikhej khulaasa kiya
 And that Tanzil Ahmed was not only in touch with the wanted fugitive criminal Munir since 2013 but also took a shop with him in Muradabad and was going to do business of the property
 par phir munir tanzeel ahamed kaa dushman kaise ban gaya?ek hi gaanv ke the tanzeel or muniramunir upi ke usee sahaspur gaanv kaa he jahaan ke tanzeel ahamed the
 The first case was registered against Munir for illegal stay in the hostel of Aligarh Muslim University
 police ko uski tabhi se talash thi
 After this, the biggest crime was registered in December last year when he looted 91 lakh rupees from the bank's cash van and shot two people
 bakaul police munir kii tanzeel se naaraazgi kii jo khaas vajahen thim wo ye hai-- munir ne 28 disambar 2015 ko dhampur main punjab neshnal bank kii cash vine se 91 lakh luute the- is lut ke baad se hi tanzeel munir ko dhund rahe the- munir ko shaq tha ki tanzeel uski mukhabiri kar rahaa he- haalanki 2013 se hi police munir ko talash rahi thi- magar tanzeel ahamed lagaataar munir ke sampark main the- munir ke saath mil kar hi muradabad main dukaan bhi kharidi- munir ko dar tha ki tanzeel use pakadava degathanzil ahamed ke katl ke iljaam main giraftaar reyaan kii maane to tanzeel ahamed ne hameshaa uske khandaan ko apamaanit kiya
 And that's why he killed them

 After defeating the BJP in Goa and Manipur including up-uttarakhand, now the Congress has become very cautious for the Assembly elections to be held later this year
 congress kii najar khaastaur par gujarat par he jahaan ke halaat use kaaphi mufeed najar aa rahe hai
 If the party manages to wipe out the bjp's 20-year-old power here, not only will a big state come into its hands, but victory in PM Modi's home country will also serve to give a big message in his favor across the country
 10 maheene main 11waan daura, modi ke baar-baar gujarat jane kii vajah kya he?gujarat kii haalia raajnneetik jameen ko dekhen, to congress ke liye ummid ke halke-halke jhonke najar aate hai
 The question is whether the Congress will be able to create a political storm in the Rann of Kutch by adding these light blows
 is sawaal kaa jawaab is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki congress apane saamne aa rahi chunautiyon se kis kadar paar paati he or apane paksh main ban rahe maukon ko kitna bhunaa paati he
 Shankar Singh Vaghela, known as 'baagu' Vaghela's unheeded 'bapu', has been the face of the Congress in Gujarat for the last two decades and there is news of his rebel before every election
 is baar bhi shankar singh waghela ne apane tevar dikhaa die hai
 On Twitter, he has unfollowed all the big and small Congress leaders from Rahul Gandhi
 aisi khabaren bhi ai thim ki shankar singh waghela kii bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se mulaakaat hui he
 It is believed that Vaghela wants to become the chief ministerial candidate this time, while he is getting a tough fight with the Bharat Singh Solanki faction
 solanki disambar 2015 se gujarat pradesh congress cameti ke adhyaksh hai
 Swords are drawn between Vaghela and Solanki for the post of Chief Minister
 ye ladaai itani badi he ki congress ko gurudas kaamat ko hataakar ashok gahalot ko gujarat kaa prabharee bananaa padaa
 After this Gurudas Kamat left the party
 congress nahin chaahati ki vidhansabha chunaav se pehle shankar singh waghela party chhod bijepi ke saath chale jaaen
 For the last 20 years, Vaghela has been the face of the Congress in Gujarat, but the party has been marginalized rather than strong
 bharat singh solanki gut kaa aarope he ki is sthiti ke liye shankar singh waghela hi jimmedaar hai, lekin congress sheersh netritv waghela or solanki donon ko saath lekar chalane ke mood main he
 The Congress does not want to lose the vote of the courtier Thakurs from whom Shankar Singh Vaghela comes
 aise main waghela ko rokna uske liye jaruri ho gaya he
 Hardik Patel may join hands with Mundankangres to protest PM Modi's visit to Gujarat! Hardik Patel, who has opened a front in Gujarat against Narendra Modi and BJP, may be helpful to the Congress for the demand for reservation
 aamtaur par patel bijepi ke voter maane jate rahe hai, lekin hardik patel ke ubhaar ke baad patel voton ke tuutane kii sambhaavna he
 Although Hardik Patel's name was earlier also associated with Nitish Kumar, Shiv Sena and Aam Aadmi Party, but now Patel has said that if Congress promises to give reservation to Patidars, they can support Congress
 congress ke andruni sutron ke mutabik prashanth kishor or youth congress ke adhyaksh raja baraar se unki mulaakaat bhi hui he
 Congress is engaged in increasing synergy with opposition parties, Congress realizes that it is difficult to win in Gujarat without adding opposition
 isliye har choti-badi party ko saath jodne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The Congress is in touch with JDU and NCP as well as parties like SP and BSP
 taaki gujarat main bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf jane vaale ek-ek vot ko bikharane se bachaaya ja sake
 In the last election, it has been seen that even though the small parties do not win the seats, they definitely make a dent in the anti-bjp votes
 is baar deshbhar main bijepi kii badhati takat se jis tarah vipakshi partiyaan ghabaraai hui hai, usase is baat ke asaar zyada najar aate hai ki ve gujarat main use rokane ke liye ekajute hone se nahin hichkichaayengi
 Dalit + Muslim + Patidar's equation After the scandal, Dalits are very angry about the BJP government
 daliton ke aguva ke taur par jignesh mevani ne gujarat or desh ke baaki hisson main bijepi ke khilaaf daliton kii aawaaj uthaai he
 Congress is also eyeing these
 vahiin hardik patel ke saath aane ke baad congress ko patidaaron kaa bhi samarthan mil saktaa he, alpsankhyak vot pehle se hi congress ko miltaa rahaa he
 That is, if the dalit-muslim-patidar alliance is mobilized in favor of Congress, then its 20-year exile of power can be overcome
 bijepi ke khilaaf he anti inkambasipichley 20 saal se bijepi gujarat kii satta main he
 It is evident that there is anti incumbency against him and there is also a challenge to cash him in front of the opposition Congress
 narendra modi-amit shah ke dilli aa jane ke baad gujarat bijepi main uthapatak rahi he
 The party does not have any face in the state that has a mass base outside the state
 iske alaava anandiben patel, vijay rupani, nitin patel jaise netaaon ke alag-alag khemon main bhi party banty hui he jisaki keemat chunaav main bijepi ko chukaani pad sakati he

 To say that she is the mother of innocent
 magar us aurat kaa karnama kisi haivaan se kam nahin
 Seeing the way he committed the crimes against his innocent son of five years, Satan once again became ashamed
 wo aurat kabhi apane beteco berahami se peethti thi to kabhi use garm chimate se daag detii thi
 Sometimes she used to prick the needle, sometimes she cut it with a knife
 us maasoom ke liema lafj hi dar kii vajahban gaya
 This story is of such a mother
 jise maa kehete huesharm ko bhi shame aa jaae
 The woman and her husband living in Indore city of Madhya Pradesh, who wasted five years of innocence
 yah agarwal dampatti nisantan thi
 Then one day, by giving money to an alcoholic junk picker, he illegally adopted innocent Karthik
 kuch din baad hi karthik par julm dhaane kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 The step mother's havoc continued daily on the innocent
 har din use maaraa peeta jane laga
 The scared scared innocent could do nothing except bear the pain
 vahaan koi uski madad karne vaala nahin tha
 Sometimes the needle was pierced, sometimes it was cut with a knife, sometimes it was placed on a hot pan, sometimes it was fired with hot tongs and sometimes it was cut with teeth
 sauteli maa kii karatuut kaa khulaasa shahar ke rajeshwari skool main hua jahaan karthik padhai kar rahaa tha
 One day, the child narrated the story of his victimization to his teacher
 apane jism ke jakhm bhi usne sabko dikhaae
 The entire body of the innocent was witness to the atrocities committed on him

 louh purush sardaar patel kii 142veen jayanti ke din dilli main mangalvaar ko yojit ‘ran for unity’ ko safal banane ke liye sarkari amale ne puri takat jhonk di
 The program was already widely publicized by the Central Government
 isi vajah se ‘ekta diwas’ par ‘ran for unity’ kaa hissaa banane ke liye yuva varg main bhi khaasaa josh dikhaai diya
 But this event became a problem for some students who came to be a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'best India'
 mangalvaar ko 14 varshiya smriti (badla hua naam) apni kabbody team ke saath subah hi india get pahunch gai
 Although there is a daily rule for them to practice at the nearby Dhyanchand Stadium, they had special meaning for the date of 31 October
 ek to desh ke pehle grih mantri sardaar patel kii jayanti par ekajutata dikhaane ke aayojan main hissaa lene kii utsukata, saath hi pradhanmantri narendra modi se rou-ba-rou hone kii khushi
 The girls were excited that they would get to know more about the Prime Minister's 'great India'
 aakhir wo vakt bhi aa gaya
 On one side, PM Modi was greeting everyone standing on the stage and on the other side the crowd of people was passing through the front
 mike par non stop camentry main pradhanmantri ke liye 'haday samraat’, ‘sabake chahete’ jaise shabdon ke saath ‘samaa bandha gaya’ jesejumalon kaa bhi istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha
 PM smiles while shaking hands and people raise both hands and express their happiness
 har koi apane mobile ke camere par in kshanon ko kaid karata dikhaa
 Everything was there, but Smriti and her teammates were missing somewhere in the crowd, who brought to the heart the expectation of the PM
 ‘ekta diwas’ ke is saare tamzam ke peeche ek aisa sach chup kar rah gaya jo kisi ko bhi dukhi kar degaa
 Smriti and her friends continued to confront Dhakkamukki throughout the event
 baat yahi tak ruk jaati to ganimat rahati
 Listen to the objection of a daughter of the country
 smriti or uski team se jab poocha gaya ki ve sab aayojan ke dauraan kahaan thim, to smriti bhavuk ho uthi
 Also said- 'we were very disappointed, the boys were hooting so much that we could not tell
 baithe baithe kabhi hamaare upar pani kii bottle phek rahe the to kabhi coment kas rahe the
 Meanwhile, the youngest member of the team, Dia (name changed) said- 'we were sitting in the field, there the boys were doing abusive things
 kabhi hamaare bal khinch rahe the, to kabhi sardaar patel kii tasviir chape parchon ko faad hawaii jahaaj bana ham par phek rahe the
 The guards present there were making such a big punch with us, to whom would we tell? We felt very bad
 'smriti or diya kii ye shikaayat us jagahpar ho rahe bartaav ko lekar thi, jis jagah par desh kaa top sarkari amala kaarykram ko safal banane main juta tha
 These daughters came out of the house with great enthusiasm to participate in the celebration of unity, but were shocked by seeing the situation there
 sapana (badla hua naam) kaa to sapana hi tut gaya
 Sapna said, 'even when others refused, we went out for a run to be a part of Unity Day
 par vahaan itani gandagi thi or log jabardastee haath laga rahe the, mujhe hi nahi meri doston ke saath bhi ye hua isliye hamen daud chhod kar waapas aana padaa
 The slogan of "beti Bachao, Beti Padhao" is given loudly, but what did these girls suffer on Tuesday, is it in any way compatible with the idea of 'best India'
 sawaal puure samaaj ke liye bhi he
 When the children who had come to mind in such a high profile program were far from fulfilled, due to misconduct, a lot had to be endured
 ab sochie, doordaraj ke ilaakon main, kam roshni vaali jagahon par, ghar se akele nikalnaa bacchiyon ke liye kitna surakshit hota hoga? jab tak puri suraksha kaa aashwaasan naa mili ye bacchiyaan sunahari ummiido ke khule aasmaan par udaan bharen bhi to bharen kaise?'shreshth bharat' kii buland tasviir tabhi saakaar ho sakati he jab in bacchiyon ko manch ke daayre se dur, camere ke lainson se pare, kagaji lakiron ko paar kar swatantra or surakshit canvas mili

 according to Imran, Ayan has a strange charm and sparkle that attracts others towards him, due to which Imran feels that as an actor he will be able to attract the audience in the future
 haalanki imran apane bete ko hero banane ke liye jor nahin daalana chaahate hai
 He wants Ayaan to do whatever he wants in the future with his own will and happiness, but yet Imran will be more happy if Ayan becomes a hero because Imran himself is associated with this profession
 imran kehete hai ki agar ayaan abhinayta banegaa to main bhi use disha dikhaa saktaa hum or is peshey ke bare main sikhaa padhaa saktaa hum
 i can't tell Ayan anything in any other field because i don't know anything other than acting
 agar ayaan is peshey main aayaa to use sabase pehle ye sikhaauungaa ki kamyaabi or naakaami ko kis tarah sanbhaalanaa chahie

 According to the decision taken by Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee, any former railway minister will be able to avail the facility of complimentary passes for two AC First Class lifetimes
 purv rail mantri ko apane liye or apane ek sahyogi ke liye vaataanukoolit pratham shrenee ke manarth paas kii suvidha thi
 Lalu had increased it to five in total while going on as Railway Minister
 iskaa matlab tha ki purv rail mantri ke alaava teen sahyogi unke saath asi first main yatra kar sakate the or ek atendent asi second main yatra kar saktaa tha
 Former Railway Minister Ram Nayak raised objections to Lalu Prasad's decision on 19 May 2009
 unhone rail mantri mamata banerjee ko patr likh kar ise faisle ko galat or anuchit qaraar diya tha
 Mamta later said that she agreed with Naik
 ovaisi bole- bhaajapa sarkaar vidheyak se gaiyr-musalamaanon ko naagarikta degeethanshchh kii is suchi ke kaaran avaidh pravasi ke myth kaa bhandaphod hughaminul islam bole- BJP kaa agenda hindu muslim raajnneeti karnaaenarsi register ke final hone ke baad em ke saansad asaduddin ovaisi ne bhartiya janata party par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Owaisi says that now the BJP can grant citizenship to non-muslims through the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 yani ovaisi ko lagata he ki jo 19 lakh log enarasi register main nahin aa paae, unamem musalamaanon ko chhodkar baakiyon ko back door se naagarikta di ja sakati he
 On the other hand, AIUDF leader Aminul Islam has said that bjp's agenda is to do Hindu Muslim politics in Assam
 ovaisi ne kaha, 'grih mantri ne apane bhaashan main kaha tha ki 40 lakh ghuspaithiye hai
 Will he still stick to his statement? duusari baat ye ki 1997 main indrajit gupta ne kaha tha ki 40 lakh ghuspaithiye hai
 Thirdly, in 1998 SK Sinha said that due to these illegal migrants many districts of the state will become Muslim dominated
 'avaidh pravasi ke myth kaa bhandaphod huaovaisi ne kaha ki haalanki, NRC kii is suchi ke kaaran avaidh pravasi ke myth kaa bhandaphod hua he
 That is why BJP is not complaining about NRC
 unhone 19 lakh logon main se kuch ne mujhe bataaya ki unke pita kaa naam NRC main shaamil he lekin bacchon kaa nahin he
 i expect the foreign tribunal to act in a fair manner
 ovaisi ne kaha ki mujhe vishwaas he ki log aavedan karenge or sankhya kam ho jaaegi
 We agree that this is a very large number but the foreign tribunal must act judiciously
 ovaisi ne bhartiya janata party ke netaaon dwaara enarasi ko sweekaar nahin karne kii baat kii ninda kii he
 He said that Hemant Biswa's statement was condemnable
 is prakriya ko supreme court kii nigaraanee puraa kiya gaya phir ve apana supreme court kholane kii koshish kyon kar rahe hai
 "they will give citizenship to all non-muslims", Owaisi said, "I doubt the BJP will bring a Citizens Amendment Bill, in which they will give citizenship to all non-muslims
" ovaisi ne kaha ki meri shikaayat bhaajapa ko vot dene vaale logon ke liye he kyonki unhone iske liye vot diya tha
 They should understand that there are no jobs in the market
 biscuit bik nahin rahe hai
 Soaps are being sold at low prices
 arthvyavastha main sab kuch neeche ja rahaa he
 Owaisi also said that the merger of banks would create more chaos
 sabhi visheshgy sahamat hai or kaha he ki isse arthvyavastha ko punerjeevit karne main madad nahin milegi
 Due to layoffs from factories, people are returning to rural areas
 lekin bhaajapa is bare main baat tak nahin kar rahi he
 They are only busy managing headlines

 chhattisgarh kaa gathan hone ke baad se hi ye seat puri tarah se bhartiya janata party kaa garh sabit hui
 Amar Aggarwal, a minister in the Raman government, has been elected as an MLA for the last 15 years
 or unke vijay rath ko rokna har baar mushkil hi lagata he
 This time too, Amar Aggarwal may face competition from Congress candidates
 haalanki, yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki ajit jogi kii party ke ummidavaar kitna bada antar paidaa kar sakate hai

 It has modern facilities as well as high court which enhances the pride of the city
 haalanki, kai samasyaayein aisi hai jinase sthaneey naagarik pareshaan hai
 For example, sewerage work, which has been done only about 50 percent
 sivarej kii maang yahaan ke nagarikon pramukh maangon main se ek rahi he, haalanki kaam shuru ho chukaa he lekin kaam kii raftaar logon kii samasya kaa vishay bani hui he
 Apart from this, the end of the Arpa river flowing near Bilaspur has been one of the major problems here
 sthaneey nagarikon ne kai baar arapa nadi ko bachaane ke liye satyagrah, andolan tak kiye hai, lekin lagata he ki abhi tak uskaa koi asar nahin hua he

 theatre main filmein dekhne kii meri shuruaati yaaden acchhee nahin hai
 i saw the first film Pyar Ka Seasons
 mere chachaa nasir hossain ne yah film 1969 main shashi kapur ko lekar banaai thi
 At that time i was 4 years old
 isamen mere bhai faisal ne shashi kapur ke bachapan kii bhoomika nibhaai thi
 One scene in the film sets the house on fire and Faisal is trapped inside it
 us drishy ko dekhakar maine ronaa shuru kar diya tha or meri maa mujhe chup karaane ke liye baahar le gai thim
 Watching the film for the second time was equally dramatic
 main laurel or hardi kii ek film dekhne gaya tha
 You would think that i must have enjoyed watching that film, but that was not the case
 ek drishy main musiibat main fansaa hardi ek diwaar par chadhane kii koshish karata he
 His trousers were slipping, causing him to run away from the wall
 lekin yahaan hansane kii bajaae hardi ke liye mujhe ronaa aa gaya
 As you can imagine, these days i like to watch movies in my home theater
 lekin bharat main cinema dekhne ke anubhav ke bare main yah meri shikaayat nahin he
 a lot has changed with the coming of the multiplex revolution, films that could never be made, they are being made now
 mere jaise log, jo apni soch main adhik shahari hai, un vishyon par kaam karne main sahajata mahasoos karte hai jinase ve apane ko jod sakate hai
 The pressure to make films for the general audience has reduced now
 lekin is nae tarah ke cinema kaa, jo adhik parishkrut logon kii kshudha shant karata he, ek doosraa paksh bhi he
 There has been a greater difference between single-screen audiences and multiplexes, and films made for ordinary people and gentlemen than ever before
 aisi sthiti main kuch filmein safal ho jaati hai, lekin zyaadaatar pit jaati hai
 More importantly, tickets have become expensive and box office collections have increased, but the enjoyment of cinema viewing has not increased
 adhik aaramdaayak siton, narm galichon, behatar airkandishan or vibhinn tarah ke khaane par khub paise kharch kiye jate hai, lekin koi bhi theatre maalik sound yaa pikchar kii quality sudhaarney par dhyaan nahin detaa
 To a creative person like me, who spends at least three months on post-production of his films, it seems discouraging
 multiplex kisi achche projector or sound system par kyon nahin kharch kar sakate or kam-se-kam ek maheene main kyon nahin unki jaanch karvaa sakate? khaas taur par isliye ki tikat kii oonchi keemton ke kaaran ek samoochaa darshak varg cinema dekhne nahin ja rahaa he?hamen kam laagat vaale theatron kii jarurat he, jo chote shaharon main badhate madhya varg kii pahunch main ho
 There will be no frills, but good quality of sound and picture will be available, where people will be able to watch movies in a clean environment
 yah vichaar us samay soojha jab main mumbai ke bichobich grant road par apni nai film talash kii shooting kar rahaa tha
 We were shooting around an old movie theater where a ticket to Balkany was Rs 15
 or stolls kaa 10 ru
 Was
 us theatre main 1995 kii meri film aatank hi aatank dikhaai ja rahi thi
 The reason for this is that no one wants to screen new movies there
 agar ham akele mumbai main is tarah ke 40 theatre banaaen or apni film pehle chakra main unamem bhi pradarshit karen to sochie darshakon kii taadaad kitni bad jaaegi
 There are over 38,000 movie screens in the US while around 9,000 in India
 hamen desh ke doordaraj ke ilaakon main jane kii jarurat he
 Also, increase your films and your film watching community

 However, when the daughter asked him questions, he could not answer them
 sakshi ne apane pita se kaha ki aapke aadmi hamen dhund rahe hai or ham par iljaam laga rahe hai, aap unhen kyon nahin roak rahe hai
 It is being said again and again that if a daughter like me is not born, then i am saying, yes really, a daughter like me should not be born in a house

" mere bare main aapke log soshal media par aapattijanak baaten likh rahe hai unhen aap kyon nahin rokte
 After this, Sakshi's father MLA Rajesh Mishra disconnected the phone and offered his best wishes
 unhone kaha ki aap log jahaan rahen khush rahen
 You will not face any danger from me
 haalanki unhone is baat kaa jawaab nahin diya ki kya aap apni beti ko apanaayenge yaa nahin

 There has been a lot of change in the thinking of the society about daughters, but even then, many such incidents keep coming up, which increases the anxiety of parents by reading or knowing
 kai parivaar aise hai jo apni betiyon ko ucch shiksha dena chaahate hai, naukari bhi karne dena chaahate hai lekin samaaj main faili buraaiyon ko dekhakar apane pair peeche khinch lete hai
 If you want, you can call it their fear but it is the result of their worry more than fear
 ye baat sahi he ki ek shaks ke aage aane se puraa samaaj nahin badal saktaa he

 Staying friends with daughter, it is very important that you stay less with your daughter as a mother or father and more as a friend

 Tell her important things
 Every prospective person should tell his daughter about self-defense
 aapaki beti ke bag main kuch aisi jaruri chijen hameshaa honi chahie jinase wo khud ko kamjor na mahasoos kare
 Apart from this, there are many such camps in which the methods of self-defense are told
 aap apni beti ko lekar vahaan ja sakati hai
 Do not impose your opinion It is right to tell your opinion to Betty and tell her its advantages and disadvantages but it is wrong to impose your opinion on her
 aap use har baat kaa bhala-bura bataa den par faisla use hi karne den
 This will increase her understanding and she will also be able to take other decisions of life without fear

 Opposition leaders also submitted a memorandum to the President led by Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 vipaksh kii maang he ki is maamle kii jaanch maujuuda supreme court ke jaj kii aguai main esaiti (vishesh jaanch dal) se karai jaae
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Kapil Sibal, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, p Chidambaram, cpm's d Raja, tmc's Idrish Ali, Manish Gupta, Sanjay Singh and Bajruddin Ajmal Judge Loya handing over memorandum of inquiry into the death of Rashtrapati Bhavan on Friday evening
 Arrived
 vipaksh ko CBI par bharosa nahirahul gandhi ne bataaya ki raashtrapati ko saunpe gyaapan par kareeb 115 saansadon or 15 raajnneetik dalon ne hastakshar kiye hai
 Many mps are skeptical as Judge Loya died under suspicious circumstances
 vahiin kapil sibbal ne kaha ki unhen sibiai par bharosa nahin he, isliye esaiti jaanch kii maang kii gai he
 Significantly, the opposition parties have already demanded a fair inquiry before the death of Jaj Loya
 supreme court ke chaar jajon dwaara is masale par uthaae gaye sawaalon ke baad rahul gandhi ne bhi media se baat kii thi
 He then appealed that the allegations of the four judges are very important
 jaj loya maamle kii jaanch sahi tareeke se honi chahie
 Rahul had said that there should be an inquiry into the case of Judge Loya at the top level of the Supreme Court, which is our legal system, we believe in it
 ek gambhir baat uthi he, isliye ham ye baat kar rahe hai
 The case is being heard in the Supreme Court by a bench headed by Chief Justice Deepak Mishra
 pichhali sunwaayee main CJI ne kaha tha ki vah sirf jaj loya kii maut se jude maamle par sunwaayee karenge
 Will not hear any other issues related to it
 supreme court ne is maamle se judi sabhi yachikaaon ko hoicourt se unke paas transfar karne ko kaha tha
 What is the whole matter? Let me tell you that Justice Loya was hearing the famous Sohrabuddin Sheikh case
 2005 main soharabuddin shaikh or uski patni kausar ko gujarat police ne agava kiya or hyderabad main hui kathith muthbhed main unhen maar diya gaya tha
 Tulsiram, a witness of the Sohrabuddin encounter, was also killed
 is maamle main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kaa bhi naam judaa tha
 The trial related to the case was transferred by the Supreme Court to Maharashtra
 is maamle kii sunwaayee pehle ek anya jaj kar rahe the, lekin is maamle main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke pesh nahin hone par unhone naaraazgi vyakt kii thi, jiske baad unka tabadalaa ho gaya
 Then Justice Loya came to hear the case
 disambar, 2014 main justise loya kii nagpur main maut ho gai thi, jise sandigdh mana gaya tha
 After the death of Justice Loya, the judge who heard the case had acquitted Amit Shah in the case
 haal hi main kuch samay pehle ek megsine ne apni report main daawa kiya tha ki justise loya kii maut saadhaaran nahin thi balki sandigdh thi
 Since then, this matter came under discussion again
 lagaataar is mudde par raajnneetik bayaanbaji bhi jari rahi he
 However, Judge Loya's son Anuj Loya had expressed his displeasure at raising the issue by holding a press conference a few days ago
 anuj ne kaha tha ki unke pita kii maut prakritik thi, vah is masale ko badhaava nahin dena chaahate hai
 Amit Shah has also given the answer: On the forum of Agenda Aaj Tak 2017, Amit Shah had said in response to a question asked on this issue that Caravan magazine printed the news about the death of Justice Loya, on the other hand an English newspaper also published the news
 
 jisko bhi andeh he wo tathy dekh le
 Is this a political conspiracy against him? On this question Amit Shah said that i do not want to say anything like that
 main kyon pachade main paduun? jisko bhi andeh he wo nagpur jaakar dekh le
 The Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad, an organization of 13 major akhadas of saints and saints, has refused to recognize the newly formed Kinnar Akhara for participation in the Simhastha fair starting on 22 April in Ujjain, the religious city of Madhya Pradesh
 lekin iske baavjood kinnar akhaada hinduon ke is mahatvapurn dharmik jamaavade main hissaa hone par adig he or uskaa do took kahana he ki use akhaada parishad kii manyata kii jarurat nahin he
 The country's famous Kinnar Lakshminarayan Tripathi alias Lakshmi has also come out in support of the Kinnar Akhara
 vah sinhasth meley se pehle ujjain ke gandharva ghat par kshipraa nadi ke safai abhiyaan main anya kinnaron ke saath shaamil huin
 Kinnar Akhara has announced that it will take its royal bath at this ghat in the month-long religious fair
 kshipraa safai abhiyaan main shaamil hone se pehle lakshmi ne kaha, ‘ham akhaada parishad se manyata maangane nahin gayi the or yah sanstha hamen manyata dene vaale hoti koun he
 The eunuch is a born yogi
 kinnaron ne sanathan hindoodharm kii raksha main mahatvapurn yogadanakia he
 We do not need anyone's certificate or recognition
 ’akhaada parishad ke adhyaksh mahant narendra giri dwaara haal hi main kinnar akhaade ko manyata dene se inkaar kiye jane par bhadakte hue lakshmi ne kaha, ‘narendra giri nirthak bayaanbaji kar rahe hai
 We don't mind opposing anyone
 hamsinghsth melaca har gatividhi main shaamil honge
 'he sarcastically said,' Some saints are opposing the Kinnar Akhara, fearing what will happen to them after taking the lead of the third-sex world
 ’ lakshmi ne sadhu-santon ke 13 pramukh akhaadon par sawaal uthaate hue kaha, ‘aakhir hinduon ke kis pramukh shaastra main akhaada paddati kaa zikr he
 On the other hand, eunuchs have special mention in many sacred texts of Sanatan Hinduism
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘kinnaron ke vajood ko sadiyon se darkinar kiya jaataa rahaa he
 We have established Kinnar Akhara to regain our lost existence and join the mainstream of society
 kinnar akhaada anya13 akhaadon kii tarah sinhasth meley mechapana tambu gaadkar dhvaj fahraayegaa
 Along with this, one will perform bhajan-kirtan, dance, aarti and yajna etc
 at the fair
 ’ kinnaron kii mashhoor maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta ne madhyapradesh sarkaar se maang kii ki use kinnar akhaade ko ve sabhi suvidhaayen or aarthik sahaayta deni chaiye, jo vah anya 13 akhaadon ko de rahi he
 He also expressed concern over pollution in the Kshipra River at Ujjain, on whose banks Simhastha Mela will be held from April 22 to May 21
 is meley main duniya bhar se kareeb paanch karod logon ke jutane kii ummid he
 Lakshmi said, 'it is ironic that the condition of Kshipra river in Ujjain has become like a drain
 lekin prashasan kumbhakarna jaisi neend main he
 Friday 6 October is going to be a very important occasion for Indian football lovers
 is din bharat kii rashtriya team fifa under-17 vishwa cap main pehali baar hissaa lene ja rahi he
 India, which is hosting this tournament to be held once in two years, has automatically qualified
 hamaare yuva khilaadi agar apane group main acha pradarshan karte hai to unhen footbal kii taqatvar tiimon—brazil, germany, england, france or spain—ke saath khilne kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 But it is almost impossible for India's novice players to reach the elimination round
 bhartiya team ke portugali coach louis norton di matos maanate hai ki bhartiya team is toornament main ek bhi match jeetne kii sthiti main nahin he
 He says, "I have full faith in this team
 lekin main yathartwaadee bhi hum
 "de Matos — who has played on several teams, including the Standard League, a ten-time Belgian champion — has played for Portugal five times and his coaching career has taken him to guinea-bissau
 ve kehete hai ki bharat ke paas pratibha he lekin anubhav kii kami he
 The players of this team have been trained in the All India Football Federation (AIFF) Elite Academy, started in Goa in 2013 at an early age
 ve alag-alag tiimon ke khilaaf khelte hue duniya kaa chakkar lagaakar valrd cap ke liye taiyaari kar chuke hai
 The team has struggled a lot in the competition
 agast maheene main usne mexico main chaar deshon ke ek toornament main hissaa liya tha, jisamen vishwa cap kii taiyaari karne vaale mejabaan mexico ke alaava colombia, chile or bharat kii timen shaamil thim
 After being beaten badly by Mexico and Colombia in that tournament, India's young team showed their stamina and won the accolades by equalizing 1-1 against Chile
 yah shaayad uskaa ab tak kaa sabase acha nateeja tha
 Earlier, a 2–0 win over "italy" in May created a sensation, but it was later revealed that it was a team of players playing in Italy's lower tier clubs, not the under-17 national team
 Which for some reasons did not qualify for the World Cup
 group banane ke liye valrd cap kaa drow bhi bharat par meharbaan nahin rahaa he
 His group consists of teams from the US, Colombia and Ghana
 mexico ke toornament main colombia ne bharat ko 3-0 se haraa diya tha
 Ghana has won the World Cup twice at this level, both times in the 1990s
 keval brazil or nigeria hi usase zyada baar yah toornament jeet chuke hai
 Meanwhile, the US has lost to two-time world champion Mexico in the finals of its continent competition
 isiilie di matos maanate hai ki apane group main bharat agar ek bhi match jeetta he to vah chamatkaar hi hoga
 Di Matos took the responsibility of coaching the team in March
 usase pehle germany ke nikolai adam 2015 se team ko koching de rahe the
 But in January this year, on a shameful visit to Russia, the players had to withdraw from their posts when they accused them of mental and physical harassment
 is daure main bharat ek match main mejabaan rus se 8-0 se haar gaya tha or anya maichon main bhi use sharmnaak haar jhelni padi thi
 AIFF official and former Indian international player Abhishek Yadav said that De Matos asked him to search for new players
 2011 main apana kariyar khatm karne vaale lambey kad ke yadav kehete hai ki ve world cap ke liye desh bhar ke vibhinn campon main 10,000 se zyada yuva khiladinnon ko dekh chuke hai
 However, it will be an unprecedented opportunity for football lovers to see young players from India playing in the World Cup
 bharat ke footbal ke bhavishya ke liye yah toornament pehla kadam he or eiefef ko yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki vah chah shaharon main hone vaale is toornament ko dekhne ke liye badi sankhya main darshak jutaaye
 This is a great opportunity for young players to show their talent
 bharat ke liye sabase acha nateeja yah nahin hoga ki vah kisi match main barabari kar sake balki videshi tiimon ko apane khel se itnaa prabhavit kar sake ki ve use apane yahaan aane kaa nyauta den jahaan training or suvidhaayen, donon mil saken
 Gujarat's Patidar leader Hardik Patel joined the Congress on Tuesday
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne unka party main shaamil hone par swaagat kiya 
 There is speculation that Hardik Patel will contest from Jamnagar Lok Sabha seat after joining Congress
 haalanki abhi tak congress kii taraf se aadhikarik rup se kuch bhi saaf nahin kiya gaya he ki vah kis seat se loksabhaa chunaav lard sakate hai
 Let us tell you that since the announcement of Lok Sabha elections dates, such speculation was being made that Hardik Patel can join Congress on any day
 jaankaron ke anusaar hardik ke congress main shaamil hone se party ko gujarat ke un ilaakon main phayda hone kii sambhaavna he jahaan patidaaron kii pakad zyada he
 Significantly, Hardik Patel, who led the agitation for reservation for the Patidar community in Gujarat, was expected to join the party on March 12 in the presence of Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 sutron ke anusaar baithak ke baad party ke sheersh netaa vahaan ek jansabha ko bhi sambodhit karenge
 It should be noted that Gujarat is the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Congress is concentrating on the state
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main sattarudh bhaajapa ko party ne yahaan kadi takkar di thi
 However, 25-year-old Hardik Patel told NDTV a few days ago that unless he has a solution to the problems of the public, there will be no point in going to party politics
 hardik ne kaha ki wo puure desh main ghumenge or satta kii galat nitiyon kaa virodh karte rahenge
 Hardik Patel, who questioned Surat's results in the Gujarat elections, also said that even though the Congress has won in 3 states, the question of tampering of evms remains
 patel ne kaha ki madhyapradesh main kaaphi der se aae nattejey phir se sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Hardik said that when NDTV India does not appear on TV in many places during prime time, confusion can be spread through social media, then how can EVM be tampered with in such a time? saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hazaare kaa kahana he ki jab ‘majboot’ lokapal ke mudde par haal hi main unhone 12 din kaa anshan kiya to janata ke bich rahete hue unhone kabhi bhi kamjor mahasoos nahin kiya
 Hazare said this to her close aide Kiran Bedi today
 kiran ne gudgaanv sthit medanta medicity main hazaare se mulaakaat kii
 Hazare has been admitted to the hospital since he broke his fast on Sunday
 purv ipies adhikari ne twitor par likhaa, ‘aaj anna se mulaakaat kii
 His health is improving
 hazaare ne kaha ki unhone kabhi bhi janata ke bich kamjor mahasoos nahin kiya
 But now he realizes what has affected his health

 (from input language) (input bhashaa se) The expectation was that good days would come for the cows of UP under Yogi Raj
 is ummid kii thos vajahen bhi thim
 Yogi Adityanath deeply loves cows

 Now the cows are inhabited in Lucknow's CM residence
 gaay kaa sawaal aae to yogi adityanath kii tatparta dekhati hi banati he jaisaa ki mulaayam singh kii bahu ke bulaave par dikhi thi
 But the reality is that the future of cows is not looking bright in Yogi Raj
 gaay paalane main jaan kaa khatrasena se ritred abraar ahamed ko abgaay palanemen dar lag rahaa he
 They see the risk of their lives in rearing cows in this changed environment

 Cows have been reared here for generations
 gaay-bhens kaa doodh bechakar parivaar apana guzar-basar karata rahaa he
 But after the news from Alwar, the fear of his heart is deepening
 behad mumkin he ki ab yahaan segayonko alavida kah diya jaae or bhainsen inke bhavishya kaa bharosa ban jaaen
 This is the ground report on the condition of the Yogi Raj men who should be alert by the government and the system

 Mohammed Mushtaq, an elderly dairy owner, sits at the risk of untoward incident

 This report is eye-opening for the Yogi government, because up's relationship with cows is not only emotional but also progresses
 upi kii iconomi ke liye gaay or bhaison kaa dudharu hona jaruri he
 Because

 UP is the largest milk producing state in the country

 He said, 'the way women are being tortured, they will not stop until women stop worshiping Shani
 mahilaon ke mandir main pravesh se unke prati hone vaale aparaadh badhenge
 Incidents like rape with women will be more
 ' unhone kaha ki shani bhagavan nahin ek grih hai or grih kii shanti hoti he puja nahin kii jaati

 agle tees din, ji haa, agle tees din main uttar korea koi aisa bada dhamaakaa kar saktaa he ki duniya dang rah jaae
 We are not saying this
 balki ye dar duniya ke sabase taqatvar mulk kii sabase tejatarra khufia agency siie kah rahi he
 The US CIA agency, quoting a picture taken from the satellite, has claimed that North Korea is planning a highly intelligence attack on the US nuclear attack
 siie ke diarector ne andeshaa jataayaa he ki uttar korea america par agle tees din ke andar newclear missile se hamalaa kar saktaa he
 North Korea's dictator Kim Jong-un changed the mask to show the changed world of Kim
 magar soch uski abhi tak nahin badali he
 On one hand, by sending his team to the Winter Olympics of South Korea, he is showing the world that he has changed
 vahiin duusari taraf wo newclear hamale kii planning kar rahaa he
 Kim's intelligence planning is revealed by satellite photos
 dekhie in tasveeron se saaf zaahir he ki kis tarah kim jong un ke aadesh par yuddh str par missile kaarykram aage bad rahaa he
 Larger disclosures than satellite photos: Satellite captures show that North Korea has made its missile program even more advanced
 jo ye bataane ke liye kaaphi he ki kim jald hi kisi parmaanu hamale kii khufia saazish rach rahaa he
 America itself is expressing this fear
 zaahir he america ne bhi kim kii is planning ke liye inhen tasveeron ko aadhaar banaaya he
 According to Mike Pampio, director of the US intelligence agency CIA itself, North Korea can attack America with nuclear missile
 siie ne jataai hamale kii ashankamerica khufia agency siie ke diarector mike pampio kaa kahana he ki hamen is baat kii chintaa he ki uttar korea ke paas aise newclear missile hai jisase wo ek maheene main america par hamalaa kar saktaa he
 However, our intelligence agency constantly discusses the possible threats from Pyongyang and its President Kim Jong Un
 hamaara kaam america ke raashtrapati tak is bare main khufia jaankaree pahunchaana he taaki unke paas is jokhim ko gaiyr-kootnithik tareeke se kam karne ke vikalp hon
 This very serious statement between Kim and Donald of America has come at a time when the US President repeatedly warns him about the nuclear threat of North Korea's cynical dictator
 is saal kii shuruuaat main jis tarah kim ke parmaanu batan ke jawaab main trump ne bade parmaanu batan kii dhamkee di usase ye sawaal uthne lage ki kahin america korea par hamale kaa bahaanaa to nahin dhund rahaa he
 So will the US adopt the same aggressive attitude against North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un as he has been adopting earlier
 pratibandh ke baavjood nahin badla kiamerica bhale hi uttar korea ko apane tareeke se samajha rahaa ho lekin sach ye he ki kim jong un ne apni kaan main tel daal rakhaa he
 North Korea is engaged in a nefarious mission to become a nuclear power without worrying about the world
 pichley saal uttar korea ne kam se kam 20 belastic mixilon kaa test kiya, jinamein teen to intercontinental belastic mixilon kaa test hua
 Because of this, the international fraternity has imposed many economic restrictions but this does not affect Kim Jong Un's health
 america kii chintamerica ke raashtrapati donald trump kaa bayaan aayaa ki uttar korea sarkaar ko avaidh newcleear parmaanu kaarykram ko band karnaa chahie or antarrarashtriya aatank par kaabo paanaa chahie
 The concern of the head of America's largest intelligence agency shows how much danger is expected from North Korea today

 congress netaa kapil sibbal ne pradhanmantri narend modi par ek baar phir sawaalon kii bauchhaar karte hue kai mudde uthaae
 Sibal alleged that Prime Minister Modi and Lalit Modi have been very close since the days of IPL
 sibbal ne kai tarikhon kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki har tarikh ke peeche kai raaj chhipe hai
 With this, he started counting the dates and explained one by one what happened that day
 sibbal ne jin tarikhon kaa zikr kiya he wo is prakaar he : 15 September 2009 narendra modi gujarat cricket sandh ke adhyaksh bane, amit shah upaadhyaksh bane or donon usee din bisisiai kii baithak main shaamil hone mumbai gaye or gujarat ko ipel ke chaar match die gaye
 16 September 2009 rajasthan royles ke shantnu chaari ne lalit modi ko i-mail kar madad maangi
 Modi said, Narendra Modi is very close to me, he will help
 17 disambar 2009 The BCCI decided to put out tenders for two new teams in the IPL
 farvari 2010 Lalit Modi went to Gujarat, met Amit Shah and Adani
 adani gujarat cricket sangh ke ek sponcer hai
 Lalit Modi added two new stipulations in the tender which were not passed by the Governing Council later
 pehali boli lagane vaali company ke paas ek billian dollar ho or wo 460 karod bank guarantee jamaa karne ko taiyaar ho
 7 March 2010 baaqi boli lagane vaali companiyon ne is par aitaraaz jataayaa
 The Governing Council later canceled the tender
 miting ke dauraan 2 baar lalit modi or amit shah ke bich phone par baatcheet hui

 At the same time, while answering Sibal, BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu raised the question that when the Lalit Modi case happened? Why was Modi allowed out of the country? When Modi went out of the country, whose government was that time? lalit modi ko desh se baahar jane kyon diya gaya or koi karrwai kyon nahin hui?tippaniyan The adamant opposition has not allowed the monsoon session of Parliament to run for a single day on the resignation of Sushma Swaraj and Vasundhara Raje, who were accused of helping Lalit Modi
 aise main pradhanmantri or lalit modi ke bich sambandhon par in nae aaropon se vipaksh ne sarkaar par hamalaa or tej kar diya he
 Referring to many dates, Sibal said that behind every date, many secrets are hidden
 isi ke saath unhone taarikh ginanaa shuru kiya or ek-ek kar bataaya ki us din kya hua
 The dates mentioned by Sibal are as follows: 15 sitambar 2009 Narendra Modi became the President of Gujarat Cricket Sandh, Amit Shah became the Vice President and both went to Mumbai to attend the BCCI meeting on the same day and Gujarat were given four matches of IPL
 16 sitambar 2009 Shantanu Chari of Rajasthan Royals e-mailed Lalit Modi and asked for help
 modi ne kaha, narendra modi mere kaafii qareebi hai wo madad karenge
 17 December 2009 bisisiai ne ipel main do nai tiimon ke liye tender nikaalane kaa faisalaa kiya
 Feb 2010 lalit modi gujarat gaye, amit shah or adani se mili

 Today is the 90th birthday of LK Advani, one of the veteran BJP leaders
 is maukey par argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii chutki lete hue adwani ko janmdin kii shubhakamanaayen twit ke jariye di
 Lalu Prasad Yadav indirectly tweeted that "warm heart to Advani's birthday, never worry if a disciple becomes a rebel
" bhagwaan aapke aage kaa jivan prasantapurna, swasth, lambii or safal banaaen
 PM Narendra Modi also made several tweets on Wednesday congratulating LK Advani on his birthday
 Warm Birthday greetings to Advani Ji! Never mind if any disciple turns hostile
 May God bless you more cheerful, healthy, long & successful life ahead! — Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd) November 8, 2017 The BJP party emerged in the 90s, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was serving as the Deputy Prime Minister
 us vakt bhi party kii agali nai peedi taiyaar karte vakt adwani ko alag-thalag kar diya gaya tha
 Even after a clean sweep by the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Advani, including Yashwant Sinha and Murali Manohar Joshi, were placed in the 'guiding board' of the party instead of leading positions
 lekin vipakshi congress ne niyamit rup se aarope lagaaya he ki bijepi ke satta main aane ke baad centre sarkaar dwaara unki koi bhi salaah nahin lee gai
 The most recent example of this can be seen that last month Yashwant Sinha cited demonetisation and Goods and Services Tax (GST) as the main reason for the decline in the Indian economy

 If you have any problem in your job / business, do these remedies- ॐ Shanti Shanscharayeya Namah Mantra, after sunset in the evening, chant 3 beads with Rudraksh garland for 40 consecutive days
 Do this remedy- Before the sun rises on Saturday, wash and take a clean clothes, burn a sesame oil lamp under the Peepal tree - Donate medicine clothes food to the sick people - Daily Not to put the habit of doing a good job 5

 The anger of the unruly mob in Delhi became so insane that a young man was beaten to death on charges of theft without any evidence
 dilli ke dwarka jile ke uttam nagar ilaake main bydaree chori ke shaq main bekaabu bheed ne 3 logon ko jamkar peeta
 In which one person died while two people are fighting for life in the hospital
 peshey se auto driver avinaash kumaar shanivaar raat uttam nagar ke khadaa tha
 Then 2 people came and took the auto book to Mohan Garden
 mohan garden ke paas auto rukvakar kisi saamaan ko laane kii baat kahkar auto vaale ko intazaar karne ke liye kahkar gaye
 In such a time the auto driver went to the toilet and when he returned, he saw that the crowd was beating them both
 donon aropiyon ne bheed ko bataaya ki auto chaalak avinaash unka sargana he
 The crowd present on the spot vented their anger on the auto driver and beat him fiercely
 bheed ne avinaash ko itnaa peeta ki aspataal main uski maut ho gai
 Actually, both the occupants of the auto were accused and stole the battery and placed it in Avinash's auto
 philhal donon aaropee aspataal menghayalhalat main bhartee hai
 It is being told that the deceased is a resident of Shahjahanpur and used to drive auto in Vikasnagar, Delhi
 police ne is maamle main dhara 304 ke tahat mukadmaa darj kar liya he
 At the same time, one of the accused who was assaulted has also been arrested, from which the police are constantly questioning
 philhal uttam nagar thana police ne mritak ke shav kaa postmortem karwaakar parijanon ko saunp diya he
 a case has been registered against the accused and they have started investigation, but this incident once again provokes the murderous anger of the crowd and humiliates humanity

 aisa hi kuch vyomakesh bakshi ne us ladke se kaha, jo niklaa to tha kranti karne magar party kii aalochana karne ke kaaran party se ghir gaya
 Now he wanted to avoid his crimes committed for the party and the partymen chasing him to kill
 isliye jhole main ustara lekar chalata tha
 When the film ends, the leftist boy asks for new books from hero and detective Vyomkesh Bakshi
 bakshi use soviet samyawad ke aalochak jorge orwell kii kitaab animal farm padhane ke liye detaa he, lekin vyomakesh kaa sahaayak uske haath se animal farm le letaa he or kahata he ki bangla kitaab padho

 shaayad raja babu yaa dabang dekhi hogi, lekin kolkata kaa bengali darshak tollywood kii filmon ko jis junun se dekhtaa he uski tulana main tamaam marketing prapanchon ke baad bhi hindi cinema kaa darshak nahin dekhtaa hoga
 Navina is a single cinema theater
 yaheen aaj hamane bangla film 'vyomakesh phire elo' (vyomakesh phir aa gaya) dekhi
 The theater was packed with audiences of all ages
 parde par vyomakesh kaa tital aate hi log kush ho gaye
 Initially, i referred to the partying and lumpangiri context in the name of communist revolution to give a glimpse of how far Bengal has come out of the Left-memory and what leftist image it has
 darshak bhi is prasang kaa pratikaar nahin karte, balki swaabhaavik rup se sweekaar karte hai
 'vyomkesh Phire Alo' is an excellent film
 kahani kehane or pakadakar rakhane main bangla filmon kaa craft mumbaiya filmon se kahin zyaada chust he
 Perhaps this will have the effect that Sujoy Ghosh's film 'kahaani' based on the background of Kolkata creates the thrill of espionage
 mumbaiya filmkaaron ne bhi jasusi film banaai he, lekin kolkatavasiyon ke muqaabale kaaphi kamazor hai
 The film does not grow with the help of sound and digital effect, but the grated dialogue and plot carry it forward
 jasusi kaa romaanch bengal ke sahitya main ab bhi bachaa he
 Sharadendu Bandhopadhyay has written about thirty novels on Vyomkesh Bakshi
 sathyajith re se lekar rituparno tak kai bade nirdeshkon ne vyomakesh bakshi ke kirdaar ko lekar filmein banaai hai
 'vyomkesh Phire Allo' is the third film of Anjan Dutta Production
 jasusi or hatya ke prasang ko itane kase hue tareeke se filmaaya he ki darshak mantrmugdh hokar dekhte rahete hai
 The acting is also fantastic
 lautne vaale darshakon ke chehre par acchhee film dekhne kaa itminan he
 Vyomkesh Babu did not like to burn cigarettes on everything
 sanvaidhanik chetavanee ke baad bhi film ke kai saare kirdaar cigarette hi pite rahete hai
 No one is making moral remarks, but it has become the same thing that without a cigarette, there cannot be a spy
 phir ise bengal ke sandarbh main dekhnaa hoga
 Every other man on the street is seen smoking a cigarette
 aap bas film dekhiye agar bangla samaj lete hai to
