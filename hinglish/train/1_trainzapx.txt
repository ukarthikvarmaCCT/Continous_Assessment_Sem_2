 After dominating Virat Kohli in the ODI series concluded against India some time ago, Pakistan's left-arm fast bowler Junaid Khan said that he knew this batsman of the opposing team would have difficulty in understanding his line and length
 teenon ekadivasiy maichon main kohli ko junayd ne hi out kiya tha
 The comments junayd ne dakshin africa ke liye team kii ravaanagi se pehle kaha, mujhe yaad he ki ekadivasiy shrunkhlaa se pehle kohli or meri mulaakaat hui or usne mujhe ki vah apane shot khelegaa or mere khilaaf ran banayega
 "I was a little apprehensive given his reputation, but when i started bowling in the first ODI, everything went right for me," he told Geo News
 mujhe pataa tha ki use meri line or length samajhane main dikkat hogi or maine use khaataa kholane se pehle hi bold kar diya
 "our rivalry continued in the next two matches as well and sending him cheap pavilions always boosts morale as he is a quality batsman," Junaid said
 junayd ne us shrunkhlaa main teen maichon main aath wicket chatkaaye the
 Junaid said before the team's departure for South Africa, i remember Kohli and i met before the ODI series and he told me that he would play his shots and score runs against me
 unhone ‘jeeyo news’ se kaha, uski pratishtha ko dekhte hue main thodaa ashankit hua, lekin jab maine pehle ekadivasiy match main gendbaaji shuru kii to sab kuch mere liye sahi hota chalaa gaya
 i knew that he would have trouble understanding my line and length and i bolded him before opening the account
 junayd ne kaha, agle do maichon main bhi hamaari pratidwandvita jari rahi or use saste main pavilion bhejkar hameshaa manobal badhata he, kyonki vah stareey ballebaaj he
 Junaid had taken eight wickets in three matches in that series
 junayd ne kaha, agle do maichon main bhi hamaari pratidwandvita jari rahi or use saste main pavilion bhejkar hameshaa manobal badhata he, kyonki vah stareey ballebaaj he
 Junaid had taken eight wickets in three matches in that series
 aakhirkaar loktantr kii adaalat main mughal shaasha babar kaa faisla bhi parkhaa jayega or us par nirnay sunaaya jayega
 The hearing of the Ayodhya case is going on in the Supreme Court and on 30 September a plea was made by the Muslim side that Babur was a sovereign ruler and the sovereign ruler was also the owner of the land
 uske kaam ko us samay lagu kanoon ke najariye se dekha jayega
 Even if he has forcibly taken and committed a sin, this court does not have the right to decide on it
 muslim pakshakaar mibahuddin or haji mahmud kii taraf se vakil nizamuddin pasha ne rakhin
 Actually Pasha was opposing the argument of the Hindu side that Babur broke the Ram birthplace in Ayodhya and built a mosque
 vah masjid islamic maanakon ke mutabik nahin thi
 Babur was a dictator
 taanashaah vah shaks hota he jo takat kaa apni ichha se istemaal kare
 In this case too, the Supreme Court is actually examining the decision of a dictator
 ab tak satta kaa sabase behatar tarika loktantr mana gaya he or bhartiya paramparaon ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to adarsh shashan raamarajy kaha jaataa he
 Babur's decision cannot be judged by the court of democracy or decide on it - this argument is dictatorial
 loktantr main raashtrapati se lekar sansad or pradhanmantri tak ke faislon kii samiksha ho sakati he
 Decentralization of powers is the biggest feature of democracy
 taanaashaahee main aarthik, sainya, nyaayik or prashasnic sabhi tarah kii shaktiyaan ek hi shaks main hoti hai or uski dharmik manyataayen hi sabase upar hoti hai
 In such a situation, how can he use his unguarded power and there is no one to stop him
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki babar bhi ek aakrantha tha or usne takat ke bal par mughal shashan kii sthapana kii thi
 The decisions of autocratic dictators are always a big problem for the people
 hitler, musolani aadi jaise iske anek udhaaharan hai or inke baad ai sarkaron ne inke har nishaan mitaae hai
 Democracy was started only by curbing the autocratic rulers in the Europe from which democracy developed today
 shashan ke liye likhit niyam pehali baar bane dastavej ko magnacarta kaha gaya jo britain main bana
 Magnacarta was composed about 300 years before Babur's arrival in India, 800 years from today
 haalanki, magnacarta ek pahal thi or loktantr kaa maujuuda swaroop kaaphi baad main viksit hua jisamen shaktiyaan vikendrit kii gayi
 Later religion was separated from power in Lokantra
 haalanki aaj bhi anek deshon kii satta main dharm shaamil he lekin vahaan loktantr kaa bharat jaisaa swaroop he bhi nahin
 The Babur judgment is being reviewed by the Supreme Court of Democracy in the context of the Ayodhya issue and it is not under the influence of religion in its nature
 jabaki agar babar ne mandir todakar masjid banavaai thi to nishchit taur par uske dharm ke prabhaav main hone kii baat kahi jaaegi
 This work was contrary to secularism while Babur's work is being reviewed by an impartial court of a secular, sovereign state
 lihaaja ye daleel or isamen kii gai maang na gale utarati he or na kahin thaharti he
 Such arguments weaken the sides
 (manish dikshit india today ke assistant editor hai)*** The tiger in Madhav National Park Shivpuri has been confirmed by scientists of CCMB Hyderabad
 vahiin panna tygar rigerv main gaayab hue shavakon kii talash kaa kaam jari he
 According to official information, senior scientist from CCMB Hyderabad, Anuradha Reddy has asked Madhav National Park Shivpuri to send as many scat samples as possible to DNA testing to find out how many tigers are in the park and their gender

 The tiger pug marks, kill, skate scratch, voice and alarm call etc
 are being regularly obtained in almost the entire area of the national park, which are being collected and collected as evidence by the regional staff here
 rashtriya udyaan ke kshetreey karmchaariyon evam graminon ne baagh ko pratyaksh rup se kai baar dekha he
 The day and night security in the National Park has been increased due to the indication of tiger movement
 vaigyanik rup se baagh ke hone kii pushti karne ke liye iskaa sket centre for cellular and melacular biolaji, hyderabad ko sabase pehle 11 agast, 2009 ko bheja gaya tha, jis par kendra ne madhav rashtriya udyaan shivpuri main baagh hone kii pushti kii
 After this, the skate sample was sent to CCMB Hyderabad again in the month of April 2010, even then the center confirmed to be a tiger
 apper mukhya sachiv (van) em
 K
 raay ke vigat dinon madhav rashtriya udyaan shivpuri main pravaas ke samay bhi rashtriya udyaan ke shaskeey daure par aaye sisiembi hyderabad kii varisht vaigyanik anuraadhaa reddy ne unase mulaakaat kar isaki pushti kii he
 Reddy has told the Director Madhav National Park that by sending more and more skate samples to the center, through DNA report they will also be able to tell how many tigers are in Madhav National Park and what is their gender
 isko dekhte hue rashtriya udyaan ke prabandhak dwaara kshetreey karmchaariyon ko kshetra main satat bhraman kar adhik se adhik scat namoonay ekatrit karne ke nirdesh die gaye hai taaki unka vaigyanik pareekshan karke adhik se adhik jaankaree ekatrit kii ja sake
 On the other hand, tigress brought from Bandhavgarh in Panna Tiger Reserve with cubs
 29 agast or 5 sitambar ko nar baagh ke saath aapas main jhagada hone kii jaankaree mili he
 On September 7, only one cub had claw marks, which made the park management apprehensive about the number of female tigers and cubs and their health
 is aadhaar par nigaraanee ko or saghan kar diya gaya
 The tigress was observed healthy on September 13, 2010 and two healthy cubs were also seen along with the tigress
 baagh evam baghin ke bich main hui ladaai main athwa anya kisi kaaran se anya shavakon ko nuksaan to nahin hua he, is sambandh main khoj jari he
 Kanha's tigress's radio caller has not been in operation for more than a year
 isliye panna baagh rigerv ke staff kii lagan va tatparta ke kaaran isaki anya saakshyon ke aadhaar par lagaataar nigaraanee jari he
 It is true that its footprints have not been getting since last 3 days, because there is hard soil all around
 is baghin ke bare main pramaan aadi sheeghra praapt karne ke bare main prayaas jari hai
 The Muslim side filed the Molding of Relief in the Supreme Court
 Appeal to take care of historical, social and cultural heritage
 Plead with pluralism, evidence and documents
 Has filed his note on Molding of Relief
 note main kaha gaya he ki court kaa jo bhi faisla hoga, wo desh ke bhavishya or aane vaali pidiyon kii soch par asar daalega

 isamen likhaa he ki ab chunki faisle kii ghadi aa pahunchi he to court faisla dete samay sabhi pakshon kii daleel, saboot or dastavejon ke saath in prabhaavon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhe
 Muslim parties have expressed hope in their note that through the Kimolding of Relief, the court will also take care of the historical, social and cultural heritage of this great country, so that our centuries old glorious common heritage and pluralistic harmonious culture will remain
 vahiin note ke aakhir main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki molding of relif ke jariye hamaara samvidhan inhen mulyon ko bachaae or banaae rakhane kii jimmedaari bhi court ko hi saunpta he

 Regional Transport Office (RTO) of Chennai said that different types of people come to the RTO

 Men in lungi and shorts are also asked to dress up properly

 MS Dhoni smart shot: Team India, thanks to their excellent performance on Friday, defeated hosts New Zealand by 7 wickets in the second T20 International match played at Eden Park in Auckland, 1-1 in the three-match T20 series
 Equaled with oakland tii-20 match main mahendra singh dhoni kaa ek ajeebogareeb shot charchaa main he
 But the most important thing is that this shot was played by Dhoni to thwart a bowler's move
 jise phens ke dwaara soshal media par kaaphi pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 New Zealand leg-spinner Ish Sodhi bowled in the 16th over of India's innings during the second T20 International match
 ish sodhi ne dhoni ko stump out karne kaa plan banaate hue is over kii paanchavin gend par maahi ke liye jaal buna
 Sodhi bowled the ball outside off-stump on which Dhoni came out of the crease to play a big shot
 lekin, dhoni ne gend ko teji se bhaanpate hue phul stretch par ek haath se ajeebogareeb shot khel diya or sodhi kaa plan fail kar bataaya ki cricket kaa master aakhir he koun?newjiland main itihaas rachane ke kareeb bharat, ‘super sande’ ko hoga faislabdhhoni

 com / moxhdvzaag — Taimoor Zaman (@taimoorze) February 8, 2019 Let us know that this is not the first time Dhoni has tried such methods to avoid being stumped out
 isse pehle bhi dhoni ne wicket ke aage apane ection se khub surkhiyaan batori he
 Dhoni was stretchered against New Zealand in 2017 to save himself from being stumped
 2017 main newsolend ke khilaaf rajkot main khele gaye is duusare tii-20 match main dhoni kii fitness kaa mujahiraa dekhne ko mila
 In this match, Dhoni went on to score at a fast pace on the ball of New Zealand spinner Mitchell Santner but he got beat and lost his balance
 'hitman' ke karishme se vishwa cricket main bharat kii aitihaasik 'hetric'dhoni ke aage nikalate hi wicket ke peeche khadey keeper ne stamping kaa mauka nahin choda
 But losing the balance, Dhoni kept his foot on the crease like Angad and stretched himself
 aapako bataa den ki oakland tii-20 match main mahendra singh dhoni 17 gend main 20 ran banaakar naabad rahe
 Dhoni and Rishabh Pant together scored 44 runs in an unbeaten fourth-wicket partnership
 pant ne 28 gend main naabad 40 ran banaae
 Now the series is at 1-1, while the third and final match will be played in Hamilton on Sunday

 Last night, it appeared that the Democratic Party leadership in the White House and Congress were attempting to make the Republican Party agree to increase the one thousand billion dollar debt limit for the long term
 yadhyapi aisa lagata he ki republican party aisa bina shart karne kaa taiyaar nahin he
 "we will not provide an unconditional loan limit increase to the president, as it will be a disaster for the country," said John Corin, a Republican senator from Texas and co-chairman of the Senate India Caucus

 On Friday, Karisma will be asked to give ratings to members of the household on the basis of the 'party to be made' task
 ve preetam ko 100 main se 80 or pranit ko 50 ank dengi, jisase donon ko bura lagegaa
 When Pritam asks Karishma why she did it, she will say that Upen has done a better job than Pritam
 preetam task ke dauraan kuch aalsee najar aae
 Karishma will give Pritam 95 marks
 isse preetam naaraaz ho jayega
 Karishma will give 85 points to Dimpy
 preetam isse kharaab mahasoos karenge kyonki dimpi ne to task kii taiyaariyon main bhi hissaa nahin liya tha
 Karishma would say that she would score 95-95 to Upen and Diandra as both took part in the decoration and Diandra worked despite being ill
 preetam ise lekar jab karishma se baat karegaa to vah apane tark pesh karegi
 Praneeth will also feel bad but will not say anything
 preetam or pranit punit se baat karenge or kahenge ki isse karishma kaa asli rang saamne aa gaya he
 Karishma will favor Upen and Diandra
 to kya isse pi3ji kii vaapasi hogi
 Karishma will give this rating in the confession room

 ayodhya kaa ek sach ye bhi he ki yahaan kii aab-o-hawa siyasat ke saath karavat badalati he
 Be it the temple building movement that took precedence 30 years ago or the Babri demolition of 25 years ago
 dharm kii nagari main siyasat kii gunj har ghatana ke saath alag sunai detii he
 In the last 25 years itself, the headlines have changed so much about Ayodhya, that now there seems to be a better reconciliation agreement than the courtroom
 kaash ki koi formula siyasat hi suza detii
 If the mosque-temple and the hindu-muslim side were in agreement, then this dispute would not have reached such a complicated point
 agar dharm or vishwaas ke aadhaar par aisi daavedaariyaan na hotin, to aisa nahin tha ki ayodhya kaa vivaad sulajhata nahin
 The initiative for this is not happening for the first time with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and the Mughal descendant Prince Yakub, but rather such efforts started before the Babri Masjid was demolished
 lekin nakaamyaab raheen
 The first attempt was made during the time of VP Singh, and negotiations with both parties also started
 lekin siyasat ne aisi karavat lee ki jo samjhaute kaa ordinance laayaa ja rahaa tha use waapas le liya gaya
 After this, the second initiative to resolve the Ayodhya dispute started during the era of the then Prime Minister Chandrashekhar and it was close to a solution
 lekin durbhaagya tha ki unki sarkaar chali gai
 After that Narasimha Rao tried but still the final solution could not be reached
 iske baad sarkaar ke str par dobaaraa samjhaute ke liye koi prayaas nahin hua
 Narasimha could not stop even after wishing that the demolition of the Babri demolition of the Babri Masjid and his entire tenure, Narasimha Rao also wrote the book, according to which he could not stop the incident even though he wanted, and this thing kept bothering him for a long time
 shaayad isi pashchaatap main unhone vivaad ke niptaare kii pahal bhi kii, lekin tab tak sabakuch badal chukaa tha
 Religious considerations and politics agenda
 magar atal bihari vajayapi ke satta main aane ke baad ye maamla ek baar phir sugabugane laga
 Realizing the seriousness of the matter, Vajpayee set up the Ayodhya department in the Prime Minister's Office and appointed senior officer Shatrughan Singh to hold talks with both sides
 vaajapeyi sarkaar main bhi mandir ko lekar koi agenda nahinvajpeyi kii aguwai main gathbandhan hi sahi, bijepi kii bahumat vaali pehali sarkaar kendra main bani thi

 film 'padmavat' ne kai maheene tak bakheda khadaa kiye rakhaa
 The issue was whether a historical character could be molded into a new narrative
 khayr, jinhone vivaad khadaa kiya, unhen kya or kitna hasil hua, iskaa pataa nahin chalaa
 The matter was finally settled
 film release hui
 But a question arose and arose in the literary world whether novels or storytelling could be done with historical characters, or should be done, or not
 
 
 ? kala yaa abhivyakti kii azaadi ke naam par kya kisi aitihaasik charitra ko vaisaa chitrit kiya ja saktaa he, jaisaa vah na rahaa ho
 
 
 The There is also the question of whether an artist can portray someone's character based on customer demand
 
 
 ?aisi rachana ko sahitya jagat main historic fiction kaha jaataa he
 It depends on the quality of the writer to what extent the historical narrative literature is able to be painted or depicted as a kind of history or a real event
 agar yaad karen, to rus ke ek lekhak alexander solzenitsin ko to ek historic fiction 'gulaag archipelago' ke liye nobel puraskaar mila tha, lekin vah upanyaas ek utkrisht katha sahitya ke rup main prasiddh hua tha
 Literature readers of the world also read it as a story rather than a history
 ab yah alag baat he ki us upanyaas ko bhi raajnneetik taur par nuksaandeh mana gaya or lekhak ko jeevanaparyant deshnikale kaa dand bhogana padaa tha
 However, it is also a different matter that it is not right to mention compositions like 'gulag' during the discussion of a novel or a political film written for any immediate benefit
 vaise bhi taatkaalik mulya kii rachanaaon kii umr zyaada nahin hoti

 har koi keval duulhaa-dulhan ko arshivaad de rahaa tha
 In today's inflation this marriage is really an example that the bride and groom did not spend a single penny and still got married

 gitanjali par 3 nahin balki 6 goliyaan chalaayin gayi thi
 This is to say that the Gurgaon Police and after this new revelation, the murder mystery of Gitanjali, wife of CJM Ravneet Garg of Gurgaon has deepened
 gitanjali ke katl ko chaar din biit chuke hai
 But the police are still looking for clues to the murderer
 or isiilie ravivaar subah police ne usee park main thik usee jagah gitanjali ke murder seen kaa reconstrekashan kiya jahaan 17 july kii shaam gitanjali kii laash mili thi
 Since Gitanjali was murdered in this park of police lines and Maktool was the wife of CJM of Gurgaon, the police also got into action immediately and are investigating the matter from every angle to solve the murder
 katl ke is maamle main sabase bada khulaasa ye hua ki kaatil ne gitanjali par teen nahin balki 6 goliyaan chalaayin thi
 Police lines usually have an atmosphere of silence at all times
 par kamaal ye he ki kisi ko bhi goli chalane kii koi aawaaj sunai nahin di
 Not even people walking in the park
 police is pahalu par bhi jaanch kar rahi he ki kya gitanjali kaa katl kahin or kiya gaya? or kya katl ke baad laash laakar is jagah jhaadi main daali gai? police sutron kii maane to police lines ke andar is tarah park main kisi par teen fire karnaa itnaa aasaan nahin he
 Because there is a whole danger of being seen and caught
 lihaaja is sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki katl kahin or hua ho or laash baad main laakar yahaan rakh di gai
 Apart from this, the police is also investigating why the murderer left the pistol on the spot
 police ko abhi tak goliyon ke khokhe nahin mili hai police unki bhi talash kar rahi he
 Not only this, apart from three bullets, deep injury marks have also been found on Gitanjali's head
 yani katl se pehle gitanjali ke saath haathaa-pai bhi hui
 Then he was hit on his head with poles or something
 jaahir he police lines main ghus kar is tarah saream park main ek sijeem kii patni kaa katl vahi kar saktaa he jo police lines ke andar ke maahaul se acchhee tarah waakif ho
 Even if he was murdered in the park and brought the corpse and threw it in the park
 philhal police ne sijim kii pistal ko siefel lab bhej diya he or report kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 Currently, Gitanjali's Murder Mystery is wrapped up in many unresolved questions
 sawaal kain hai or police inhen sawaalon ke jawaab talashne main lagi he
 And in this effort, the police questioned CJM Ravneet Garg and his relatives
 or is poochtacha ke baad police ne ravanit garg ke do laptop bhi jabt kar liye
 These are the questions related to the murder of Gitanjali, wife of CGM Ravneet Garg, which the Gurgaon Police has been trying to solve for the last 4 days
 lekin police ko abhi tak kaatil kaa koi bhi suraag nahin mila he
 In this case, the police has questioned CGM Ranveet Garg for about four and a half hours on Saturday
 poochtacha ke dauraan gitanjali ke gharavaale bhi maujuud the
 The SIT team of Gurgaon Police also interrogated Judge Ravneet Garg along with her and her relatives at Kothi Number 10, his official residence at Civil Line, Gurgaon
 poochtacha ke baad police ne ravanit garg ke 2 laptop unke revolver kaa cese or ek box ko jabt kar liya
 During interrogation, the Gurgaon Police asked CGM Ravneet Garg several questions related to Gitanjali's death
 cese main kai ansulajhe sawaal hai jaise katl ke vakt yani 5 se saat baje ke bich main shaam ko wo kahaan the
 , With whom? Whom did he talk to over the phone during this time? Where did he keep his revolver? Did Gitanjil go for a walk with a revolver daily? Were they unhappy about having daughters? Have you ever expressed your desire for a son from Gitanjali? Were there often differences between the two? Who are the two people on whom the judge has expressed suspicion of murder
 un donon se ravanit yaa gitanjali kii kya dushmani ho sakati he? kya gitanzil har roj apana mobile lekar nahin jaati thi? katl ke din gitanjali kaa mobile kahaan tha? revolver hameshaa loded rakhte the yaa phir kaartoos ghar main alag rakhte the? kya gitanjali ne kabhi kisi se dushmani kaa zikr kiya tha? adaalat kaa koi aisa faisla jiske chalate ranjishan kisi ne unki patni gitanjali kaa katl kar diya?udhar gitanjali ke gharavaalon kaa aarope he ki ravanit kii ek rishtedaar hina ne unako bataaya tha ki hina ne gitanjali vaardaat vaale din kareeb 4 baje khaanaa khaaya tha lekin postmortem report main gitanjali ke pet se khaanaa nahin mila tha
 Not only this, when Gitanjali's mother called at seven in the evening on 17 July, Hina picked up the phone and Hina told her that Gitanjali has gone to the market some time ago and she will tell Gitanjali about it as soon as she comes back
 
 police ab gitanjali or ravanit garg donon ke phone colls detail kii jaanch kar rahi he
 It is possible that the secret of Gitanjali's death is hidden in the phone call itself
 haalanki gijantli ke parivaaravale maan rahe hai ki gitanjali kii maut ke peeche pati ravanit kaa haath he lekin jaj kaa parivaar sire se in aaropon ko khaarij kar rahaa he
 Geetanjali's family lodged an FIR against Ravneet Garg on 19 July in which they alleged that the judge wanted a son but his relationship with Geetanjali was severed due to having 2 daughters
 lekin ravanit kaa parivaar sidhe sidhe ise nakaar rahaa haigitanjali or ravanit garg kii shaadi 2007 main hui thi lekin gitanjali ke parivaar kaa iljaam ye bhi he ki beti ko dahej ke liye sataaya ja rahaa tha
 The judge's family has also denied the charge
 chunki maamla jaj or unki patni se judaa he or philhal surkhiyon main he lihaaja police har angel se isaki jaanch kar rahi he
 It is expected that soon a string of links related to Gitanjali's death will be opened
 kurukshetra uniwarsity kii emb topper gitanjali mahilaon ke haq kii aawaaj apane andaaj main uthaati thi
 Through poetry
 tab gitanjali ko kya pataa tha ki teen maheene main wo usee jyaadati kaa shikaar hogi, jiske khilaaf wo sangharsh kii aawaaj uthaa rahi thi
 This is the same Gitanjali - wife of Gurgaon Chief Judicial Magistrate Ravneet Garg, who was killed on July 17

 The Goddess of justice will decide who killed a Gitanjali in a period of making half the population strong and why

 Bahujan Samaj Party President and former Chief Minister Mayawati going to the Rajya Sabha is not unexpected, having lost the election battle with the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh

 Another specialty in Mayawati is that she has appeared as the Chief Minister in the Legislature
 mayawati ek alag tarah kii netaa hai
 He has never made a presence in the Legislature as an MLA or member of the Legislative Council in his nearly one and a half decades of politics and has not raised any issue inside the House as Leader of the Opposition
 pehali baar 3 june 1995 ko mukhyamantri banane ke baad se unhone sirf mukhyamantri kii haisiyat se hi sadan main pravesh kiya he

 Left-wing ideologue veteran advocate Ranveer Singh Chauhan said that Mayawati has always migrated to Delhi after defeat or loss of power, which does not seem fair in any sense
 unhen vipaksh kii bhi bhoomika nibhaakar janhit main sangharsh karnaa chahie
 He also said that Mayawati or her party has always mobilized by staying in power, while other political parties have been agitating in opposition

 "lalu is alive
 sab bolte the ki lalu khatm ho gaya
 Look where it's over
 " lalu yadav ko jaise hi maine kaha ki log bataa rahe hai ki aap bihar main number do par aa gayi hai
 Lalu started saying that i am number one
 chalis kaa chalis seat jeet rahaa hoon
 i have stopped the BJP in Bihar with a single helicopter
 helicopter se koi ruka ho yaa na ho magar helicopter na ho to reliyon main gadgadaahat paidaa nahin hoti he
 In the scorching heat, Lalu's claim was passing over his head
 camerakaar mohammad kii haalat karaab hone lagi thi
 i also felt that something was going wrong
 laga ki sugar down ho gaya he 
 In the middle interview, Lalu asked Yadav that you had something to eat
 meri haalat karaab ho rahi he
 Lalu shrugged phir kisi ko kehane lage ki khaane kaa intazaam ho saktaa he
 By then tea arrived
 mujhe to chaay se raahat mil gai par mohammad kii tabiyat karaab hone lagi
 Camera off
 intervyuu ho chukaa tha magar mohammad pet pakad kar baith gaye
 Don't know what happens when shooting
 haalat karaab thi par camere ke saamne saamaanya dikhne ke liye muskura rahe the
 Lalu was giving a speech and i was asking for water from his driver
 kaha sahab ke liye ek hi bottle he
 given

 Later the local journalist got food at the house and we returned to normal
 narendra modi ne reliyon kaa str itnaa bhavy kar diya he ki log bhul chuke hai ki chunavi sabhaayen bhi hoti hai
 There is no arrangement like Narendra Modi's rally

 jabaki aaj hi modi kii bihar main hui sabhi reliyon kaa kuch na kuch hissaa channelon par zarur chalaa hoga
 Only baits of Lalu, Mayawati, Mulayam and Nitish run
 modi, rahul, sonia or priyanka hi live hote hai
 Lalu's meeting was arranged as if a procession was arranged on the way
 koi chamak damak nahin
 No manager handling the press
 lalu kii sabha main helicopter dikhne se pehle koi sau log bhi nahin the
 As soon as the helicopter appeared, it was not known from where the venue was filled within five minutes
 samaj hi nahin ki kahan se itane log aa gaye
 While Modi's rally was going on in Chapra at the same time
 logon ne bataaya ki dhoop ke kaaran bheed baghiche main intazaar kar rahi thi
 Suddenly people in Bihar have started talking about Lalu's rise
 kya sachmuch lalu ne modi lahar ko roak diya he
 This may seem due to Lalu's claim and the attraction of the crowd towards him
 aaj bhi log lalu kii baat ko dhyaan se sun rahe the
 When bjp's claims can be said to be credible, why not Lalu? agar lalu ne aisa kar diya to ve modi ke saamne bade netaa ban jaayenge

 Whether it is in favor of Narendra Modi or not, in this election there is a big change in political social relations
 bhaajapa yaa sangh kaa ek kamaal yah bhi he ki usne har chowk chauraahey par apane samarthakon ko aakraamak daleelon se las kar diya he
 When i go to someone's rally, these people come near the camera and start Modi
 damdaar bahes karte hai
 i do not find any SPE or Congress in the BJP rally, but there is definitely a change in the rally of the rest or the youth who does Modi
 ab poochne laga hoon to pataa chalata he ki swayamsevak he yaa bijepi netaa ke rishtedaar
 By the way, other people could have done this work, who has stopped it
 inke modi modi karne se pehle bheed kuch or baat kar rahi hoti he lekin achaanak aise tatwon ke aane se bheed chhantane lagati he
 The same poster has a picture of Lalu Sonia and Shahabuddin

 Currently the question is whether Lalu will really stop BJP

 samvidhan bachaao nyaay yatra kii shuruyaat karne ke kram main argedy netaa or purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav shuukravaar shaam katihaar pahunche
 During his night stay in Katihar, Tejashwi Yadav went to Balathi Maheshpur Dalit Tola in Kursela block, where he had dinner at the home of a Mahadalit family
 domen ram, mahadalit ke ghartejasvishuukravaar kii shaam takreeban 8:30 baje pahunche or unke ghar ke halaat kaa jayja liya
 Tejashwi first expressed his desire to defecate and Doman reached the toilet built outside Ram's house, but seeing the condition of the toilet, he fiercely whipped the Bihar government
 tejasvi ne kaha ki bihar sarkaar or centre sarkaar shauchalay banane ke liye karodon rupye kharch kar rahi he, lekin iske baavjood bhi domen ram jaise mahadalit ko khud apane paise se shauchalay bananaa padaa he
 This toilet is also not complete, because it does not have a door
 iske baad tejasvi domen ram ke mitti ke ghar main gaye
 Seeing the condition of the stunning house, Nitish lashed out at the government and said that under the Indira Awas Yojana, the government gives money to the poor to build houses, but that money does not reach the poor like Doman Ram
 iske baad tejasvi ne domen ram se poocha ki kya unke ghar main nal kaa pani aata he yaa phir bijli aati he
 In response, Doman Ram said that both these things have not yet been available at his house
 is par tejasvi ne kaha ki bihar or centre main ab dabl ingine kii sarkaar hone ke baad bhi garibon ke liye kuch nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Due to this, incidents like Nandan village are happening where Mahadalits attacked Nitish Kumar's convoy few days back
 iske baad tejasvi ne sthaneey vidhayak or sahyogiyon ke saath domen ram ke ghar par jameen par baithkar raatri bhojan kiya
 In the meal, Tejashwi was served with poori, potato cabbage vegetable and rice pudding
 ajtak se baatcheet karte hue tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki pichley 12 saalon se nitish kumaar daawa kar rahe hai ki bihar main vikaas kaa kaam hua he
 He came to Mahadalit Tola to investigate the development especially for the poor and Mahadalits
 gauratlab he ki, ab tak ke apane chote raajnneetik jivan main tejasvi yadav ne kabhi bhi kisi mahadalit ke ghar main bhojan nahin kiya he
 When asked who inspired him to do so, Tejashwi said, he has learned all this from his father Lalu Prasad
 isse pehle, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi kai maukon par daliton ke ghar jaakar bhojan kiya he
 Now the name of Tejashwi Yadav has also been added to this episode
 aaj tak se baatcheet karte hue tejasvi ne kaha ki apane nyaay yatra ke dauraan vah andekhi or special rajya kaa darja nahin die jane ke mudde ko uthaaenge
 He said that he will also take the issue of nexus between Nitish Kumar and BJP and the issue of no development work in Bihar
 vahiin, duusari taraf mahadalit domen ram ne kaha ki tejasvi yadav ke unke ghar par aane or bhojan karne ko lekar vah kaaphi khush hai or ab ummid karte hai ki unke parivaar kaa kuch bhala hoga
 Interestingly, the RJD was hitherto mainly known as the party of Yadavs and Muslims, while the Dalit and Mahadalit had a hold of Nitish Kumar's party
 lekin baxur ke nandan gaanv main jis tareeke se mahadaliton ne apane ilaake main vikaas ke kaary nahin hone ko lekar pichley maheene nitish kumaar ke kafile par hamalaa kiya tha uske baad se hi tejasvi dalit or mahadaliton ke mudde ko uthaa rahe hai
 Not only this, a few days after the attack on Nitishke's convoy, Tejashwi Yadav also reached Nandan village for the police atrocities on Mahadalits
 ab nyaay yatra kii shuruyaat karne se pehle mahadalit ke ghar main bhojan karke unhone apni raajnneeti ko ek nayaa swaroop dene kii koshish kii he
 Owaisi said, Bhagwat is not talking about stopping mob lynching
 Has spoken hyderabad ke saansad ovaisi ne mob linching par die mohan bhagwat ke bayaan par kaha ki jis vichaardhaara ne mahatma gandhi or tabrej kii hatya kii, usase zyada bharat kii badanaami nahin ho sakati
 Owaisi said, Mohan is not talking about stopping the incidents of Bhagwatling, but he is saying that it should not be called lynching
 bataa den ki mangalvaar kovijayadashmike maukey par swayamsevakon ko sambodhit karte hue mohan bhagwat ne kaha kimob linchingpashchimi tarika he or desh ko badnaam karne ke liye bharat ke sandarbh main iskaa istemaal nahin kiya janaa chahie
 The victims were Indians
 Who garlanded convicts? Who draped them in 🇮🇳? We’ve a Godse loving BJP MP
 There can't be a bigger defamation of India than ideology that killed Gandhi / Tabrez
 Bhagwat isn’t saying stop lynching, he’s saying ‘don’t call it that’https: / / t
 co / hhsnh61pka — Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi) October 8, 2019 On Bhagwat's statement, Owsi referred to the killing of Mahatma Gandhi, saying the victims were Indians
 doshiyon ko kisne maala pahanaai
 Who wrapped the corpse in the tricolor
 bijepi saansad godse se pyaar karte hai
 The ideology that killed Gandhi, a woman, cannot be a bigger infamous name for India
 bhagwat linching par roak kii baat nahin kah rahe hai, wo kah rahe hai ise linching na kaha jaae
 Owaisi's big attack, while addressing a public meeting in Beed, alleged that the incidents of mob lynching have been increasing in India since 2014, with a deliberate mindset
 unhone kaha ki agar mohan bhagwat kehete hai ki mob linching kaa bharat ke saath koi sambandh nahin he, to main unhen yaad dilaanaa chahta hum 
 
 
 Mob lynchingska has a relationship with this country
 
 
 
 The manner in which the people of the Sikh community were killed after the assassination of Indira Gandhi was also mob lynching
 ovaisi ne kaha, agar ve (mohan bhagwat) yah kahana chaahate hai ki mob linching kaa bharat se koi sambandh nahin he, to main unase poochna chahta hum ki 2002 main gujarat main kya hua tha
 
 
 If Mohan Bhagwat says that there is no connection with mob lynching, then Bhagwat should stop people with Godseki mentality who killed Tabrez
 
 
 tabrej ansaari kii hatya karne waalon kaa bijepi mantri ne swaagat kiya tha
 So as long as such murders continue, mob lynching will continue in India

 piem ne video conferencing ke jariye tamilnadu ke bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ke saath samvaad ke dauraan kaha ki congress netaa ek taraf sena pramukhon ke liye apshabdon kaa istemaal karte hai or sargical strike kaa majaak udaate hai to duusari taraf unhone 1940 or 50 ke dashak main jeep ghotaale se lekar 1980 ke dashak tak boforce tak, agastavestland or pandubbi ghotaale tathaa anya ghotaalon ko anjaam dekar desh ko luutane kaa kaam kiya he

 PM Modi: Sadly, for Congress, national security & defence sector is either a punching bag or a funding source

 On the other, they looted the defence sector, from the jeep scam back in the 40s & 50s, (1 / 2) pic

 The death of Arun Jaitley is like a big loss for the BJP

 Arun Jaitley had expressed his wish to PM Modi not to join the new cabinet citing his health after the bjp's landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone piem se ko likhaa ki main aapse vinamr nivedan karnaa chahta hum ki main khudke liye thodaa samay chahta hum
 i want to tell you that my health is not good, in such a situation i feel unable to fulfill any responsibility given by the party

 His kidney was transplanted at AIIMS on 14 May last year and was replaced by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal at that time
 gauratlab he kiarun jetali ke liye raajnneetik halkon main anaupchaarik taur par mana jaataa tha ki vah 'padhe likhe vidwaan mantri' hai
 For more than three decades, Jaitley has almost always been the favorite of the power system, no matter the government, because of his ability to do so

 During the debate on the motion of no confidence in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi attacked the Modi government fiercely, but all the members present in the house were shocked when Rahul Gandhi went straight to PM Modi's seat after finishing the speech and embraced Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 apane bhaashan ke dauraan rahul gandhi ne kaha ki aap chaahe kitna bhi gaali de lo lekin mere andar aapke prati prem he
 This is the spirit of the Congress
 yah bhaavana aapke andar bhi he or main aap sabake andar se is bhaavana ko nikaaloongaa or aap sabko congress main badaloongaa
 After saying this much, Rahul Gandhi walked fast from his seat to PM Modi's seat, shook his hand and hugged him

 However, after this, the PM stopped Rahul Gandhi and he too shook hands with Rahul and then hugged him
 is dauraan unhone rahul kuch baat bhi kii lekin record nahin hone ke kaaran wo sabake saamne nahin aa pai
 Earlier Rahul Gandhi said, 'I am grateful to the Prime Minister and the RSS that they explained to me the meaning of Congress

 Hindustani means, no matter what you say, abuse, lie, lathi, you should have love for it in your heart

 com / clhkegfygg After the results of the assembly elections of five states came out, Congress was cleared from two more states of the country
 uttarakhand main jahaan uskaa supada saaf ho gaya, vahiin manipur main sabase bada dal hone ke baavjood wo sarkaar nahin bana saki
 Though the party won a great victory in Punjab, but after the crushing defeat in UP and before the results of different assembly elections in the country, it is being said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream of Congress-free India is coming true
 haalanki inhen nateezon ko ek alag najariye se dekhen to tasviir kuch or najar aati he
 In fact, after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, if small states like Goa and Manipur are left out, then 10 states Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Bihar, Delhi, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have assembly elections
 in rajyon main kul loksabhaa siton kii 60 fisadi siten yani 543 main se 317 siten aati hai
 According to the Dada Driven website indiaspend, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Congress contested 1544 assembly seats (under the Lok Sabha constituencies) and in these 10 states it could win only 194 i
e
 its success percentage was just 13
 haalanki loksabhaa chunaav ke baad in rajyon main jab vidhansabha chunaav hue to congress ne 1032 vidhansabha siton par apane ummidavaar utaare or inamen se uske 258 ummidavaar jeet bhi gaye, yani uski safalataa kaa pratishat 13 se badhkar 25 ho gaya
 Not only did the number of seats double, but in 2014 in these states where she got 20 percent votes, she was able to improve her performance by taking 30 percent votes in the assembly elections
 agarvot sheiraki baat karen to congress ne bihar, pashchim bengal, tamilnadu, uttar pradesh or punjab main loksabhaa chunaav kii tulana main zyada vot hasil kiye
 Although this alleged good performance of the Congress was also the result of an alliance with its different parties, but it cannot be said that if the Congress had contested the elections alone, its vote share would have been less
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ravivaar ko apni cabinet vistaar ko amalijama pahana diya he
 These included new 9 faces
 iske alaava 4 mantriyon ko tarakkee dekar cabinet mantri banaaya gaya he
 Recently, many ministers have resigned in this regard
 isamen upi ke brahman cheharaa maane jane vaale calraj mishra bhi shaamil he, jinhone apane mantri pad se istipha diya he
 There is talk of Kalraj Mishra being made governor
 aisa hota he tokalraj mishra ko devariyaloksabhaa seat se bhi istipha dena hoga
 With this excuse, the Opposition of UP can get a big opportunity, where it can revive its political power
 khaskar BSP pramukh mayawati or samaajawaadee party ke supremon akhilesh yadav ko
 In fact, after Yogi Aditnath became UP CM, Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat and Keshav Maurya's deputy CM are becoming vacant after Phulpur Lok Sabha seat
 kyonki donon netaaon ko party MLC ke jariye sadan main lee rahi he
 If Kalraj Mishra is made Governor, he too will have to leave his seat Deoria
 is tarah teen loksabhaa siton par upachunaav honge
 Let me tell you that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP had won the victory of 71 seats in UP
 darasal loksabhaa 2014 or vidhansabha 2017 ke chunaav main karaari haar ke baad vipaksh ke liye bada mauka hoga
 Meanwhile, talk of maya-akhilesh fighting by-elections has also been repeatedly raised
 aise main donon ke bich agar samjhauta hota to aise main bijepi ke liye jeetna tedi kheer sabit ho sakati he
 In this way, for Narendra Modi and Amit Shah who want to create atmosphere for 2019, it can also come as a big shock
 ab aapako samaj main aa gaya ki mahasampark main ek ghar par kitna samay dena he?” pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 1 may ko 7 rescorse sthit apane aadhikarik nivas par milane aae bijepi adhyaksh amit shah samet mahasampark abhiyaan kii team ke sadasyon ko vidaa karte hue sukun bhari muskaraahat ke saath yah sawaal poocha to sabhi ne mand muskaan ke saath hami main sir hilaa die
 In fact, this was a message to the party of the Prime Minister, which he himself showed
 bijepi ke sabase pehle sadsy ke naate chand minuton kii aupchaarikta puri karne ke baad naashte kii mej par ankurit chane khate-khilaate hue modi ne sabhi netaaon se unke parivaar ke bare main charchaa shuru kii jo raajnneeti or desh tak pahunch gai
 It was not known when one and a half hour passed while discussing the government's work with light things
 isliye jab aakhir main pradhanmantri ne sawaal poocha to uskaa marm shah ke sipahasalaron ko samaj aa chukaa tha
 But till that time the BJP hardly thought that it would be difficult to find the house of new members formed after the Modi wave
 darasal, takanic par savaar hokar janaadhar badhaane kii kavayad party ko baari pad rahi he or ab usne sadsyta abhiyaan ke puraane taur-tareekon ko hi mahasampark abhiyaan kaa naam de diya he
 Amit Shah started the Mahasabdata Abhiyan campaign on November 1, 2014 with the goal of creating 10 crore members and by April 2015 the party also claimed to be the world's largest political party, confident of surpassing the target, but when this figure When doubts were raised, the party devised a three-pronged strategy to approach all the members from house to house and train them to join the party's ideology
 
 
 
 But the BJP got entangled in the figures, but this strategy of BJP got a shock when the membership campaign had no trace of four crore of the 10-11 crore people involved through missed calls
 inamen zyaadaatar aise the jinhone missd kol to diya tha, lekin esemes ke jariye apana naam-pataa party ko nahin bheja tha
 Kailash Vijayvargiya, national general secretary associated with the mass campaign, says, "initially, 30 to 40 percent of the figures were not available, but we have corrected the situation by adding professionals
 ” lekin ve jis uttar pradesh ke mahasampark abhiyaan kii jimmedaari sambhaal rahe hai, vahaan bhi 1
 Just 1 in 86 crore members
 56 karod number sahi mili or durust naam-pataa vaale sadasyon kii sankhya ek karod mili
 However, a senior UP leader claims that 50 lakh forms have been submitted in the state and the state is ahead of the rest of the states in missed calls
 bijepi jis sadsyta abhiyaan kii kamyaabi par kulachen bhar rahi thi, mahasampark abhiyaan kii hakeekat se uski dhadakanen bad gayi
 According to sources, when the BJP leadership felt that the mess of data could take away its title of being the largest party in the world, the party used its power at the center to its fullest
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai, “hamen sadasyon kaa pataa dhundne main shashan se bhi madad mili
 Through the Ministry, by providing mobile numbers to the mobile service provider companies to get the addresses of the people removed
 ” mobile companiyon se gaiyr-aadhikarik taur par nijee jaankaree hasil kii or mahasampark kaa khaakaa bhi telecom sarkal ke hisaab se banaaya
 Apart from this, the party also added professionals associated with IIT, IIM, who searched the website and called every number whose name-address was not on record in the BJP office
 iske baavjood bijepi chaar karod main se mahaj 1
 Was able to find 200 million people
 is abhiyaan se haal hi main jude party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shyaam jaju kehete hai, “aaj hamaare paas 8-9 karod kaa spasht data aa gaya he, baaki teen karod ke aasapaas aise aankade hai jinhen talashne main thodi dikkat aa rahi he
 "what is the reason for the delay? The campaign of the public relations campaign has ended on July 31, but it does not seem to be completed yet
" party ne sabase pehle apane sakriy kaaryakartaaon se is abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii, jinhone sakriy sadsy banane ke liye jaruri 100 saadhaaran sadsy banane ke maapdand ko puraa kiya tha
 But here too the party had to face problems
 darasal, bijepi ne aam chunaav main jeet ke baad utsaah main logon ko sadsy banane kii badi muhim ched di
 Under this, people started making missed calls at all places such as street, street, intersections, trains, buses etc
 jaisaa ki bijepi ke ek jila str ke kaaryakarta kaa kahana he, “hamane camp lagaae to vahaan aasapaas ke rajyon se aane vaale log bhi the, jinase missd kol karavaaya lekin takneekee vajahon se esemes aane main deree hoti thi
 That data was deposited in the respective state and now when it was found for the General Assembly, it was found that this number belongs to another state
 ” kai kaaryakartaaon ke paas naam-number donon the, lekin pataa chalaa, us jagah par falaan naam kaa koi vyakti hi nahin he
 Post offices' PIN codes also mixed data in some places
 jaisaa ki jaju khud bataate hai ki kuch jagahon ke naam se bhi bhram kii sthiti bani, masalan-aurangabad bihar or maharashtra, donon jagah he
 punjab-haryana data was also mixed due to the pin code
 bijepi bhale deree ke liye takneekee vajahon ko jimmedaar maan rahi he, lekin buniyadi str par kaam karne vaale kaaryakartaaon kii daleel kuch or hi he
 At the beginning of the membership campaign, the atmosphere was good in favor of BJP, but the situation changed with the defeat of Delhi Assembly elections
 iske alaava kaaryakartaaon se lagaataar kaam lene kii vajah se bhi thakaavat kii sthiti he
 Soon after the membership, the BJP started the work of setting up a General Camp and then a General Training Camp
 mahasampark se judin bijepi mahasachiv saroj pandeya kahati hai, “mahasadasyata ke lakshya ko hasil karne ke baad mahasampark kaa kaary pragati par he
 But it is true that there has been some delay
 ” ve bataati hai ki deree kii vajah sanghathanaatmak kaaryon ke saath-saath kuch rajyon ke chunaav or is abhiyaan ke saath hi prashikshan varg kii shuruyaat bhi he
 Saroj claims that this target will be 100 percent met
 aise to lagenge chah saal!bijepi bhale aankadon ko durust karne or mahasampark kaa lakshya hasil karne kaa daawa kar rahi ho, lekin nirdhaarit samay seemaa khatm hone ke baavjood party 10
 91 million has reached only 4 million people
 party ne sitambar tak kii nai samay seemaa tay kii he
 But the data received by India Today shows that in the current situation the party is reaching 45-50 thousand people on an average day
 yah sthiti tab he jab bijepi ke netaa yah daawa kar rahe hai ki ab yah abhiyaan raftaar pakad chukaa he
 Even if this performance of BJP is accepted as a measure, it will take six more years to reach the homes of all its members
 upi ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai, “party ne shuruyaat main thodi chook kar di
 If the data were shared with the state units at the same time as the membership drive, there would not have been such a problem
 ekamusth data milane se kaaryakartaaon par bhi boj badha he or bahut saare number ab nahin mil rahe
 "the party is also beginning to understand this difficulty
 kendriya netritv kii kii ore se sabhi rajya ikaayiyon ko nirdesh de diya gaya he ki jab tak lakshya puraa nahin ho jaataa, kisi ko vishram nahin diya jayega
 But the BJP has started working on the strategy of save for the success of this campaign
 sadsyta abhiyaan ke aankadon kii jimmedaari sambhaal rahe bijepi mahasachiv arun singh mahasampark main deree ke sawaal ko hi khaarij karte hai
 He says, "there is a process of active membership in the organization and only 100 members are included in this category
 sau sadsy banaakar use ek form main bharkar mandal str par jamaa karnaa hota he or jila str par do padaadhikari use satyapit karte hai tabhi koi sakriy sadsy banataa he
 Overall the number of such workers is 6
 5-7 lakh he
 That is, from November 2014 to April 2015, about 6-7 crore members have been contacted and you can call this public relations campaign the process of establishing revival contacts
 ” maujuuda abhiyaan main deree ke sawaal par unki daleel he, “hamane sadsyta abhiyaan ko pehali baar vaigyanik or suvyavasthit tareeke se aage badhaayaa
 But some people got confused about the missed call to be given in the mass campaign too
 lihaaja missd kol utani sankhya main nahin aa paae, jitani sankhya main form ikatthe hue hai
 "classification" formula to increase mass base Amit Shah had recently said in Bengaluru that the BJP would reach out to all 10 crore members in the mass campaign and tell them about the party's vision
 yahi nahin, bijepi ke paas in sabhi sadasyon kaa data hoga
 But according to sources, the party has now made a strategy to reach only those members, which will be easy to reach because despite all the efforts, it does not yet have complete information about all the members
 party ne ab sadasyon kaa vargeekaran karne kaa formula apanaaya he
 That is, apart from active members, a category has been contacted and the members who are not able to reach it will be kept in a separate category
 lekin bijepi un numberon ko apane data se baahar nahin karegi jin tak vah nahin pahunch paa rahi
 Pandey says, "every member who dials bjp's number has been influenced by our ideology, so he will be associated with us
 ” yani yah shrenee bijepi ke liye matadaata ke baad mandaata vaali hogi, jinhen takneekee vajahon se bijepi apana kaaryakarta nahin bana paa rahi
 But Shah is also experimenting differently to achieve his goal of increasing the base of the party
 sadsyta abhiyaan main saat rajyon&maharashtra, gujarat, madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh, karnataka, bihar or rajasthan ne ek karod se zyada kaa lakshya hasil kiya or ab mahasampark ke liye in rajyon main alag se ek kendriya padaadhikari ko tainaat kiya gaya he
 In addition, during the membership drive, Shah focused on seven states & Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, Assam, Odisha and West Bengal where the number of members has increased
 lekin mahasampark kii sthiti utani acchhee nahin he
 To increase the number of active members, the party is also going to include those who are proficient in a particular area and can give some time to serve
 isliye 6-7 lakh sakriy sadasyon ke alaava itani hi sankhya main nae sadasyon ko jodakar 15 lakh logon kaa mahaprashikshan abhiyaan shuru ho chukaa he
 500 training camps will be held everyday in September
 nae prayogon se bijepi kii sadsyta teen karod se badhkar 10 karod ke paar pahunch gai he
 But if the mass campaign is made the scale, then this number will be around 6-7 crore
 aise main kya bijepi duniya kii sabase badi party hone kaa record kaayam rakh paaegi? Taking a dig at Congress rebel MP YS Jaganmohan Reddy, Union minister and senior party leader from the state s Jaipal Reddy said he was violating party discipline and his activities were 'undesirable'
 reddy ne kaha ki jagan ke swaamitv vaala sakshi channel apane kaaryakramon ke madhyam se congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi, pradhanmantri manmohan singh or rahul gandhi par nishaanaa sadhakar party ko kamjor kar rahaa he
 The minister while answering the question asked regarding the programs of Sakshi channel said, 'everybody knows that this channel is his (jagan) and he is airing it for his politics
 is channel kaa durupyog party ko kamjor banane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 It is unwanted

 aaie jaane, apane footware or ghar donon ke ahm hisse ko aise rakhen sahejkuch aasaan tipskimdad se
 - Place the shoe rack in a place where dusty soil is less so that it does not need to be cleaned daily
 - shu rack agar lakdi kaa ho to hameshaa dhyaan rakhen ki lakdi polish kii gai ho taaki dimak se lakdi bachi rahe
 - If not daily then clean the shoe rack once a week

 - There are many footware that we use very little, so instead of keeping them in a shoe rack, pack them in a box and keep them separate

 According to Deviprasad Duari, director of MP Birla Institute of Fundamental Research, MP Birla Planetarium, 'audiences in India are lucky because both partial and complete eclipses will be fully visible from all parts of the country
 ' He told that eclipse will also be seen in South America, Africa, West Asia and parts of Central Asia
 is baar purna chandra grahan ek ghante 43 minute kaa hoga, jabaki aanshik grahan ek ghante se adhik samay kaa hoga
 Duari said that the partial lunar eclipse will begin at 11
54 pm Indian time on July 27 and the full lunar eclipse will start at 1 am on July 28
 vaigyanik ne bataaya ki chandramaa 28 july ko tadake 1 baj kar 52 minute se 2 baj kar 43 minute tak sabase zyada andhkaar main rahegaa
 He said, 'after this period, there will be a partial lunar eclipse on July 28 at 3
49 am
 bharat main khagoleey ghatnaon main ruchi rakhane vaale logon ke liye yah svarnim avasar hoga kyonki grahan lagbhag puri raat dikhaai degaa
 ' 27 july ko purna chandra grahan ke dauraan chandramaa prithvi kii chaaya ke madhya hisse se hokar gujaregaa
 During a full lunar eclipse, when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow, it turns bright orange to red in color and becomes darker and darker in a rare event
 yahi kaaran he ki purna chandra grahan lagata he or us samay ise blad moon kaha jaataa he
 Asked if it would be safe to see the lunar eclipse with no eyes, Duari said, "no special equipment is needed to see a lunar eclipse like the instruments used to see a solar eclipse
" 
 kisi ko bhi grahan dekhne ke liye telescope kii jarurat nahin he
 However, a good quality telescope will provide a better experience
 bhashaa gola manisha This time the full lunar eclipse will be of one hour 43 minutes, while the partial eclipse will be more than one hour
 duaari ne bataaya ki aanshik chandra grahan 27 july ko bhartiya samyaanusaar raat 11 bajkar 54 minute par shuru hoga or purna chandra grahan 28 july ko tadake ek baje shuru hoga
 The scientist said that the moon will remain in the darkest darkness from 1:52 am to 2:30 pm on 28 July
 unhone kaha , 'is avadhi ke baad 28 july ko tadake 3 baj kar 49 minute tak aanshik chandra grahan rahegaa
 This will be a golden opportunity for people interested in astronomical events in India as the eclipse will be visible almost all night
 ' During the full lunar eclipse on July 27, the moon will pass through the central part of the Earth's shadow
 purna chandra grahan ke dauraan chandramaa jab prithvi kii chaaya se hokar gujarata he to vah chamkile naarangi rang se laal rang kaa ho jaataa he or ek durlabh ghatana ke tahat gahare bhure rang se or adhik gaharaa ho jaataa he
 This is the reason why a full lunar eclipse occurs and at that time it is called blood moon
 yah puche jane par ki kya chandra grahan ko bina kisi upkaran ke ankhon se dekhnaa surakshit hoga, is par duaari ne kaha, 'saura grahan dekhne ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale upkarnon kii tarah chandra grahan dekhne ke liye koi vishesh upkaran kii jarurat nahin he
 No one needs a telescope to see the eclipse

 duusari taraf jejepi ko yuva party ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha, jisaki aguai ek noujvaan netaa ke haath main thi, jo haryana kii raajnneeti ke diggajon kaa muqabla kar rahaa tha
 The assembly election results broke many myths and raised hopes of reviving opposition forces across the country
 jaisaa ki pichley kuch chunaavon—dilli, bihar, madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh—se jaahir he, pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa karishma or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah kii jabardast chunavi mashinari hameshaa bhaajapa kii jeet pakki nahin kar sakati
 In the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the entire country swept in the Modi wave, in contrast, voters in the state elections decided the functioning of the state government before choosing the winners, seeing the promises of the parties challenging them and the leadership of the contesting parties
 Huh
 modi or shah jatigat samikarnon se aage jaakar jitau chunavi gathjod bunane main badi had tak kaamyaab rahe hai, jaisaa unhone 2017 main uttar pradesh main kiya tha, magar haryana kaa janadesh sabit karata he ki jati kii ahmiyat ab bhi he
 According to political observers, the discontent among the Jats of Haryana led to the emergence of Dushyant Chautala and the Congress was also able to come back to the fight, led by former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda
 haryana kii raajnneeti main jaaton ke dabadabe ko khatm karne kii garaj se modi ne 2014 main manohar laal khatter ko mukhyamantri bana diya tha, jo sire se bahari shaks or punjabi khatri hai or unke pita pashchimi pakistan se aae the
 In this way Modi got the displeasure of a large section of the Jats
 jat is baar bhi modi ke saath to khadey hue, par ve khatter ko maaf karne ke mood main nahin the
 According to analysts, the community felt that the Khattar government's policies closed the doors of jobs for them in public sector institutions and their movement for reservation in government jobs was dealt with fairly and arbitrarily
 haal hi main jaaton ne do maheenon se zyada vakt tak virodh pradarshan yojit kiye or bhartiya rashtriya rajmarg praadhikaran ke haathon adhigrahit kii gai apni jameenon ke liye muaavje kii maang kii
 But he did not get any relief from the state government
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main kareeb 19 fisadi jaaton ne bhaajapa ko vot diya tha
 An analysis by the Center for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) shows that in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the support of the Jats in favor of the BJP jumped to nearly 50 per cent
 lekin khatter us samarthan ko is chunaav main banaae rakhane main naakaam rahe
 Says a BJP insider, "khattar ran the administration efficiently, he brought transparency in the (government) recruitments and delivery of government services, but he failed to gauge the anger of the Jats and even to remove it Did not do much
 '' vahi gussa jat netaaon dushyant or hooda ke haq main kaam aayaa
 In the early days of his chief minister, Khattar had to contend with the notion of failure to maintain law and order
 2014 main baba rampal ke bhakton ke haathon hui hinsa, 2016 main aarakshan kii maang kar rahe jaaton ke pradarshnon or 2017 main balaatkaar ke maamle main baba gurmeet ram rahim singh ko doshi tehraae jane ke baad hue dangon kii vajah se unke saamne kanoon or vyavastha kii chunauti pesh ai
 Khattar's cabinet colleagues openly criticized his 'inexperience' and his handling of these incidents 'poorly'
 magar dhire-dhire unhen aatmavishvaas or kamyaabi donon mili
 He was credited with bringing transparency in governance, even in a state where corruption had become commonplace in public life
 rajya ke purv mukhyamantri omprakash chautaala or unke bete ajay—dushyant ke pita—jahaan bhrashtachar ke ek maamle main jail kii sajaa kaat rahe hai, vahiin pravartan nideshaalay ne hooda ke khilaaf aarope patr daakhil kiya he
 During the election campaign, Khattar told voters how to bring transparency in government postings and appointments, and also in allowing land use change
 bhaajapa ne rashtriya suraksha, jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 ko hataane or bhrashtachar mukt rajkaaj ko bhi apane chunaav abhiyaan main mudda banaaya
 But for most voters, the real concern was about the economic downturn, agricultural crisis and basic amenities like water, electricity and health services
 haryana, jahaan bharat kii takreeban aadhi automobile menuphaccharing hoti he, is kshetra main susti se do-chaar ho rahaa tha
 The state also saw a 54 percent increase in farmer suicides during 2015 and 2016 — from 162 to 250
 hooda or unke bete deepender ne anuchhed 370 par centre kaa samarthan karke, phir bhale hi iske liye unhen party ke rukh ke khilaaf janaa padaa, is mudde ko beasar kar diya
 The Congress put more emphasis on local issues
 hooda, khatter sarkaar ko un '154 vaadon' kii yaad dilaate rahe, jo usne kiye the lekin 'puure nahin hue'
 The BJP was not only confident of returning to power, but had set a target of winning more than 75 seats
 uske is aatmavishvaas kii ek vajah yah bhi ki vipakshi khemon main afratfari machi thi
 Organization changes in the Congress were done very late, just a month before the election, which shocked the party's prospects

 is lav story ke viral hone kii vajah yah he ki isamen premika purv sex varkar hai or premi ek apahiz bhikhaari
 Bangladesh photographer Aakash has shared this special love story on his Facebook page with a picture on 14 May
 is post ke mutabik bangladesh kii sex varkar razia begum ko bhikhaari abbaas mia se pyaar ho jaataa he
 The length of their first meeting is no less than a film story
 ek din kaaphi barish ho rahi thi, razia ped ke neeche khadi thi
 For some reason, Razia was crying at that time, when she saw a beggar sitting in a wheelchair
 bhikhaari najadik aayaa or razia ke haathon main 50 taka (bangladeshi mudra) de diya
 At that time it came to Razia's mind that this is the first person in my life who has given me money without using me
 isi baat par razia us bhikhaari ko duniya kaa sabase acha insaan samajhane lagi
 The two separated after this meeting
 razia ne bhikhaari abbaas ko kai dinon tak dhundha
 But he did not get it
 kai maheenon baad razia ko abbaas ek ped ke neeche phir baitha mila
 When both of them had a conversation, it was found that his wife had left him due to being bedridden
 donon ne ek-duusare kii taraf haath badhaayaa or phir ek saath rahane ko taiyaar ho gaye
 a few days later both of them got married
 razia ke hawaale se akaash ne apane post main likhaa he ki, vah khud ko ab kisi se pyaar karne karne ke kaabil nahin samajhati thi, lekin marate dam tak bhikhaari abbaas kaa wheelchair aage badhanaa chaahati he
 Now both of them have been married for four years
 tippaniyan Razia said that at the time of marriage, Abbas promised that he would never let her cry, which he is still performing today
 kai baar ghar main khaane ko kuch bhi nahin hota he, phir bhi donon jaise taise pet bharkar raji-khushi jivan bitaa rahe hai
 Razia reveals that she does not remember who her parents are
 vah kis umr main sex varkar bani
 She wanted to get out of this business for a long time, but could not do so due to the upbringing of her daughter
 haalanki usne apni beti ko kabhi bhi nahin bataaya ki vah sex varkar hai
 Everything has become normal after Abbas' arrival in life
 puraa parivaar khushi ke saath rahete hai
 One day it was raining heavily, Razia was standing under the tree
 kisi vajah se razia us vakt ro rahi thi, tabhi uski najar wheelchair par baithe ek bhikhaari par padi
 The beggar came close and gave 50 taka (bangladeshi currency) in Razia's hands
 razia ke dimag main us vakt aayaa ki mere jivan main ye pehla insaan he jisane bina meraa istemaal kiye mujhe paise die hai
 At this point, Razia began to consider that beggar as the best man in the world
 is mulaakaat ke baad donon alag ho gaye
 Razia sought beggar Abbas for several days
 lekin vah use nahin mila
 Several months later, Razia finds Abbas sitting under a tree again
 donon ne aapas main baatcheet kii to pataa chalaa ki apahiz hone ke chalate uski patni use chhodkar chali gai thi
 Both of them extended their hands towards each other and then agreed to be together
 kuch hi dinon baad donon ne shaadi kar lee
 Akash, quoting Razia, wrote in her post that, she no longer considered herself capable of loving anyone, but wants to carry the wheelchair of beggar Abbas till death
 ab donon kii shaadi ke chaar saal ho gaye hai
 The comments razia ne bataaya ki shaadi ke samay abbaas ne vaada kiya tha ki vah use kabhi rone nahin degaa, jise vah aaj bhi nibhaa rahaa he
 Many times, there is nothing to eat in the house, yet both of them are fulfilling their happy lives
 razia ne bataaya ki use yaad nahin he ki uske maa-pita koun hai
 At what age did she become a sex worker
 vah kaaphi samay se is dhandhe se nikalnaa chaahati thi, lekin beti ke paalan-poshan ke chalate aisa nahin kar paa rahi thi
 However, he never told his daughter that he was a sex worker
 jivan main abbaas ke aane ke baad sabakuch saamaanya ho gaya he
 The whole family lives happily
 is mulaakaat ke baad donon alag ho gaye
