 Patidar leader Narendra Patel, who has accused BJP of procuring money by giving one crore rupees, has claimed in an interaction with Aaj Tak that he has audio-video evidence of money transactions
 patel ne kaha ki vakil se salaah mashvira karne ke baad ise saarvajanik karenge
 Patel had claimed that Varun Patel, who joined the BJP, offered him Rs 1 crore
 iske saath hi is deal main jitu waghavdi bhi shaamil tha
 He said that all people are against BJP, so they are trying to buy us
 unhone kaha ki main apane samudaay ko bijepi kaa asli cheharaa dikhaanaa chahta tha
 Narendra said that 'hardik is an active leader, he does whatever he says
 ' patel ke daawey ke baad vipakshi partiyaan bijepi par hamalavar hai
 But now recently Varun Patel, who joined BJP, has hit back at Narendra Patel
 unhone kaha ki narendra ko puure 1 karod rupye lekar hi press conference kerani chahie thi, kyon sirf 10 lakh rupye lekar saamne aae
 Varun said that the entire Patidar society is connecting with BJP, i am also connected for the benefit only

 The attacker Narendra Patel, the convenor of the opposition party, came to the media with a cash of Rs 10 lakh
 hardik patel ke gut kaa kahana he ki ve dhire-dhire saboot saamne laaenge
 At the same time, the Congress has given its response saying that BJP is constantly trying to buy people
 congress ne bataaya ki rajyasabha sadsyta ke chunaav main bhi bijepi ne kharid-farokht kii koshish hui thi
 Gujarat's Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani said that BJP has been doing this manipulative politics
 jis tarah gujarat model kaa bhanda phuta he or gujarat kii janata sadakon par ai he, uske baad bijepi or bhi logon ko kharidne kii koshish karegi
 There is political mercury in the Gujarat assembly elections
 patidaar samaaj ke do netaa reshma patel or varun patel pehle hi BJP main shaamil ho chuke hai
 While OBC leader Alpesh Thakor has announced to join Congress
 hardik patel ne bijepi ko haraane ke liye congress ko sashart samarthan dene kii baat kahi he

 In the 2004 heavily reshuffled assembly elections, Uma Bharti disguised the Congress stronghold and waved the saffron flag at Bhopal's Shamla Hills
 us saal madhya pradesh kii tejatarraar sanyasini or rajasthan main ajey rani ne sangh parivaar ko atirikt oxigen muhaiyaa karai thi
 But Bharti's fast came in the way of keeping the mandate and his successor Babulal Gaur proved to be very lethargic
 aakhir shivaraj singh chouhan ne janaadhar ko vyapak kiya
 Khanty Sangh Parivari Chauhan never forgets to be reminded of Hindu culture
 unke paas hindutv kaa jhandabardaar banane kii kaabiliyat or saakh donon thi
 He quickly realized that Gopuja (he banned cow slaughter) and Surya Namaskar (which was made compulsory in schools) would not make him a 21st century market value leader
 chouhan kii krishi or bijli kshetra main uplabdhiyaan bemisaal hai, par unhone vikaas kii raajnneeti main saamaajik puunji ke mahatv ko bhi badi chaturaai se samaj liya he
 The figures testify to this
 18 varsh se 40 varsh aayu varg ke 60 pratishat se zyada matadaata unhen phir gaddi par dekhnaa chaahate hai or college-shikshiton ke to 65 pratishat kii ve pasand hai
 The choice of this class of voters is not Chauhan, the protector of cows, but a champion of modernity
 haalanki ve aaj bhi jamini netaa hai, unke vyaktitv main koi tadak-bhadak nahin balki saadagi he, unki apil khantee desi he
 Today, BJP is getting an edge over local leaders with similar support base

 52% of the people want to give him a third term in the country's possibly most risky state, where the Maoists are playing bloody by taking advantage of the confusion over the country's internal security
 or shaayad yahi kaaran he ki mukhyamantri kii lokapriyata kaa graph ooncha hote hue bhi 58 pratishat log maowad se nipatane main sarkaar ke tareekon kaa samarthan nahin karte
 The Raman influence in the administration is seen in providing schemes like their one rupee kg rice to the poorest sections, which is their option for food security
 chhattisgarh ke pehle nirvaachit mukhyamantri raman singh ab bhi puure dam-kham ke saath kaam kar rahe hai
 In Rajasthan, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has left no stone unturned to return
 unhone loklubhaavan kaaryakramon kii jhadi laga di he lekin unki yojanaaen rani kii vaapasi main shaayad hi aade aaeh vahaan 52 pratishat log badlaav chaahate hai
 In just five years, Gehlot has transformed Rajasthan into a state where 45 per cent of the people believe that the government's biggest failure is to increase the crime rate against women

 Opinion polls show that the queens are on the verge of making a second start

 This phase is not good for any Congress leader and as evidenced by successive public opinion polls, Modi's nationwide appeal has given the saffron fraternity an extra edge in the assembly elections
 aaj bhartiya raajnneeti main modi us sachai ke pratik hai ki satta centre se praanton kii ore ja rahi he
 The myth of Narendra Modi is built on the record of Gujarat being the best administered state
 madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main gujarat ke alag-alag rup dikh rahe hai
 The BJP may have seen a fight among the leaders at the center, but its satraps have worked tirelessly to keep their stronghold
 congress main aisa kuch nahin dikhaa
 The Center is weak and the state leaders are even tighter than that
 in chaar rajyon main loksabhaa kii 72 siten hai
 So, in the summer of 2014, the maharathis who came out of these states will become Modi's warlords in the battle of the throne of the country

 2015 ke aakhir main shaomi ne ek smartphone launch kiya tha
 The name was Mi MIX
 smartphone launch hote hi duniya bhar main surkhiyaan batori
 The reason was that it was quite different from traditional smartphones
 isamen bejal na ke baraabar the or sirf disple dikhaai detaa tha
 It was then launched only as a concept, but it could be used easily
 is smartphone ke launch hone ke baad companiyon ne kam bejal ke smartphone utaarne shuru kiye
 When it came to Bari again, the company recently launched the next and stable variant of MI MIX i
e
 Mi MIX 2 in China
 maheene bhar baad ise ab bharat main bhi launch kar diya gaya he or isaki bikri november ke pehle hafte se shuru hogi
 For review, i have been using Mi MIX 2 for a week
 is smartphone kai tarah se parkhaa he
 Now let's know its review
 dizin or bild qualityh smartphone dekhne main safataur se dusron se alag he, kyonki isamen sirf metal yaa plastic yuj nahin kiya gaya he
 It uses ceramic in the back along with a metal frame which makes it premium
 dekhne, yuj karne or hold karne main yah premium feel detaa he
 It has curved edges, so it is quite easy to hold despite having a large display
 duniya main gine chune hi smartfones hai jinamein is tarah kaa siremic dizin diya gaya he
 The back panel which is ceramic is really fantastic and it has a camera ring which is 18K gold
 back panel par likhaa he mix dizin bai shaomi
 Being ceramic, you can see yourself comfortably like a mirror in its back panel
 antena lines kahin najar nahin aate, sirf ye frem par dikhaai dete hai
 There is a flash module in the camera's replacement which would have been wonderful if the company had given it inside the panel
 lekin aisa nahin he
 There is a fingerprint scanner under the camera, which is quite fast
 phul disple hone kii vajah se isamen aam smartphone kii tarah disple ke upar kii taraf sensors nahin dikhenge
 All sensors have been turned inside
 yahaan tak kii yearpys ko bhi andar kii taraf kiya gaya he taaki kam se kam bejal or zyada disple di ja sake
 The bottom has two speaker grilles and a USB Type c port
 headphone jaik nahin diya gaya he, lekin iske liye box main conector aata he jiske jariye isamen koi bhi headphone conect kar sakate hai
 The back of this smartphone acts like a fingerprint magnet and as soon as you take it in hand or touch your fingerprints will start to appear and dust comes quickly on it
 dizin kii acchhee baat ye he ki yah haath se phisalata nahin he
 However, the company also offers a back cover with it, which is quite good and you can use it
 bild quality or dizin ke maamle main is smartphone ne hamen prabhavit kiya he
 Now-a-days, companies are either giving metal or using glass metal in cheap to expensive smartphones
 lekin shaomi siremic dizin vaale smartphone ke saath ai he jise mashhoor diziner philip stark ke saath dizin kiya gaya he
 Display The Mi MIX 2 has a 6-inch LCD display that is full HD and has a resolution of 1080x2160p
 front panel kaa zyaadaatar hissaa disple hi he kah sakate hai 80 fisadi hissaa
 Talking about pixels per inch, it is 402, so despite having an LCD display, the screen looks good
 lekin phir bhi shaomi ne agar isamen quad echdi yaa jaisaa hamane Galaxy Note 8 main oled panel dekha vaisaa hota to yah smartphone main chaar chand lagaataa, lekin afsos aisa nahin he 
 However, its display will not disappoint you and sharp images will be seen
 vuing angal bhi badhiya he or brit bhi he
 You can see it even in the light of the sun
 yakeen maniye agar aisi disple kisi duusare smartphone main hoti or he bhi to ham ise behatar nahin bataate
 But this is not the case with MI MIX 2
 agar baat video dekhne yaa gaming kii karen to asli majaa aata he
 Because there is no bezel on display and if you watch video in full screen and do gaming, then this experience is amazing
 parformanceni MIX 2 main qolkom kaa flagship procesar Snapdragon 835 lagaaya gaya he
 It has 6GB of RAM and its internal memory is 128GB
 ham is rivyuu main kisi benchmark yaa phir kisi theory par baat nahin karenge
 We will talk to the Indian customers that what it can show in real life
 main computer gaming main zyada dilchaspee letaa hum or kol of duty siries ke sabhi games khele hai
 In this smartphone, i spent many days only gaming, not call of duty, but played a shooting game whose graphics are very heavy
 gaming main jiro lag he or phone thodaa garm hota he
 This phone is not a master in multi tasking, despite being the flagship processor
 shaayad ye shaomi ke apane oparating system kii vajah se
 But there is no problem in app switching
 lagaataar 10 din yuj main kuch minutes ke liye phone ne rispons karnaa band kiya wo bhi 10 se 20 seconds tak ke liye
 In terms of performance, we cannot give it 10 out of 10 at all, but in daily life, it gives as much performance as an ordinary user expects from a smartphone
 camerallikhane ko to iske camere main kai chije hai
 As such it has a camera of 4 megapixes optical image stabilization of 12 megapixels
 iseman soni IMX386 sensor he jiskaa aparchar f / 2
 Is 0
 isamen phase ditection autofocus or dual elidi flash diya gaya he
 The camera ring given in it is 18K gold plated
 selfi ke liye isamen f / 2
 a 5-megapixel front camera of 0 aperture has been given
 delite main aap isse acchhee tasviren clic kar sakate hai, lekin zyada diteling kii ummid na karen to behatar hoga
 You may be disappointed
 haalanki proper lite ho to diteling badhiya he
 Its camera does not affect under low light
 kul mila kar aap iske camro ko iphone 8 yaa Galaxy Note 8 ke paimaane main nahin rakh sakate, isliye is range ke lihaaj se camera shandaar to nahin, lekin yah niraash bhi nahin karata
 You may find it difficult to take a selfie, because the front camera is not on the top, but downwards
 aisa isliye, kyonki upar bejal na hone kii vajah se camera ke liye jagah nahin he
 So the front camera is down and as soon as you open the selfie camera, you will have to reverse the phone to take a direct selfie
 bydaree bavepadani MIX 2 main 3,400mah kii bydaree milti he jisamen qolkom quick charge 3
 0 support has been given
 yani isamen fast charging he
 Charges up to 45 percent in half an hour
 haalanki phul charge karne main 1
 Will take 5 hours
 lekin puure din ise aaraam se chalaa sakate hai
 Messenger, Facebook, calling and surfing can be run for 12 hours comfortably
 gaming karnaa he to aadhe din main aapako ise charge karnaa hoga
 If your budget allows, then this smartphone will be a profitable deal for you
 kyonki iske kai factor aise hai jo is segment ke duusare smartphone se ise alag karte hai

 Prices of commodities in common need skyrocketed, fuel shortages completely disrupted the transportation system and depleted medicines to an alarming extent in hospitals
 isse bhi badtar baat yah rahi ki na to rajya sarkaar or na hi centre sarkaar ne is nakaabandi ko khatm karaane ke liye turant koi pahal kii
 The state also faced a blockade for two months in June 2010
 iske baavjood golmi haar maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai or yah nahin maan paa raheen ki unka rajya naakaam ho gaya he
 He says, "I know that the press likes negative news more, but in the last year a lot of good things have happened in the state
" main samajhti hum ki manipur main do saal pehle ke mukaable aaj kahin zyada aman or chaiyn he
 At least this is why reports of fake encounters are not making headlines here
 ''is tarah kii baat karne vaali golmi akavli nahin hai
 Although most people believe that the state government has failed to find a political solution to most of the problems here, the law and order situation has improved a lot in the last one year

 The National Crime Records Bureau's India 2010 report released in October shows that the number of cognizable offenses is declining
 2008 main aise aparaadhon kii sankhya 3,349 thi, jo ghatakar 2009 main 2,852 or 2010 main 2,715 rah gai
 The Director General of Police, YY, is responsible for reducing the number of cognizable offenses

 '' Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has said that his party does not agree with Punjab's ruling Akali Dal's demand for commutation of death sentence of Khalistan Liberation Force terrorist Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar to life imprisonment
 lakhanu main yojit ek samvaadadaata sammelan main nakvi ne kaha ki is mudde par bhaajapa kaa rukh saaf he

 Therefore, bjp's stance in this regard is already clear
 " nakvi ne kaha ki ek shashakt lokapal vidheyak bananaa chahie
 On this, the Congress-led central government should take a positive stance by taking all political parties into confidence without adopting a lax attitude
 anna hajaare or unki team par centre ke mantriyon or netaaon dwaara kiye gaye hamalon par bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki centre sarkaar kii bhrashtachar se ladane kii ichhashakti eemaandaar nahin he, tabhi usne hameshaa yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki uske mantri paak-saaf or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan karne vaale galat hai

 rajasthan kii 25 main se 13 siton par loksabhaa chunaav (indian General Election, 2019) kechauthe charan ke liye aaj matdaan ho rahaa he
 These seats are a challenge for the BJP and for the Congress too are no less than a headache
 saal 2004 se yah ek trend chalaa ja aar rahaa he ki jisane bhi vidhansabha kaa chunaav jeeta he usko loksabhaa chunaav main safalataa mili he
 In the assembly elections held in December last year, the Congress has managed to form a government in the state, but the BJP has given a tough competition to the Congress in the entire state
 vah bhi satta virdohi lahar kaa saamana karte hue
 There is not much difference in the vote share of both the parties
 aaj jin 13 siton par loksabhaa chunaav ho rahaa he agar unke vot pratishat ko vidhansabha chunaav ke hisaab se se dekhen to bijepi ke kul congress se 2 pratishat se zyada hai
 If this vote percentage is converted into seats, then Congress can go for only three seats and BJP with a total of 10 seats
 iske baad agar paanchaven charan kii baat karen to jin 12 siton par matdaan hoga vahaan congress ke vot bijepi se 3 pratishat zyada hai
 If it is converted into seats, the Congress is seen getting 9 seats here
 haalanki rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav hue kareeb 6 maheene ho gaye hai or is bich kareeb 13 nirdaleey vidhayak congress main shaamil ho chuke hai
 At the same time, Hanuman Beniwal, who had become angry with the BJP, has again formed an alliance with the BJP
 hanuman beniwal jatigat samikarnon ke hisaab se khaasaa mahatv rakhte hai
 Now the thing to be seen is that in this changed political scenario, where do the voters stand
 gauratlab he ki saal 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ne sabhi 25 siten jeet lee thim
 But after that the anger of people against CM Vasundhara Raje's government started increasing in many cases
 padmavat vivaad, alvar cond jaise kai muddon ko rajya sarkaar thik se manage nahin kar pai or iske baad rajya main do siton par hue loksabhaa upachunaav bhi bijepi haar gai
 State Congress President Sachin Pilot agitated on many issues and its impact was on the ground
 congress ke paksh main maahaul banataa gaya
 But it was not as if the government of CM Vasundhara Raje had accepted it easily
 jahaan sabhi agsit pole rajasthan main bijepi kii karaari haar kii ore sanket de rahe the vahiin bijepi ko 75 siten mil gayi

 - input bhashaa se Comedy veteran Sunil Grover often laughs and entertains people with his character and acting
 'gutthi', 'doctor gulati' or 'santosh bhabhi' ke rup main sunil grover (sunil Grover) ne na keval khub surkhiyaan batori thim, balki apni ek alag hi pahchaan bana lee thi
 Apart from all this, Sunil Grover had also acted brilliantly in the film 'bharat' with Salman Khan
 lekin sunil grover(sunil Grover) kaa tivi se lekar bollywood tak kaa yah safar aasaan nahin tha
 Early in his career he faced many difficulties
 itnaa hi nahin, shuruaati samay main sunil grover kii ek maheene kii kamai hi maatr 500 rupee hoti thi
 He himself revealed these things through the blog of social media blog Official Humans Bombay
 “I was always good at acting & making people laugh
 i remember in 12th grade i took part in a drama competition – the chief guest said that i should not participate, because it was unfair to the others! After i finished my masters in theater, i came to Mumbai to act
 But for the first year, i only partied
 i lived in a posh area, using my savings & some money from home
 I'd only earn around Rs
 500 a month
 But i thought I'd be successful soon
 Going i realised that there were many like me, who were 'superstars' of their town & 'strugglers' here
 Soon i had no income & was given a harsh reality check
 i was demotivated
 But i remembered how my dad wanted to be a radio announcer & even had an offer
 But because my granddad was against it, he had to work at a bank & regretted it
 i didn't want to let my dreams go
 So i picked up the pieces & rigorously looked for work
 But the road was still rocky
 Once I'd been selected to act in a TV show – we'd even shot for a few days
 But when i stopped getting my time to come on set, i called the team–they said I'd been replaced
 At the same time i also started getting work in voiceovers
 So when I'd be rejected from TV & films, i had a cushion to fall back upon–something that most didn't have
 i realised how fortunate i was & regained my strength bit by bit
 Around that time, i got offered to do a radio show
 It was only going to be aired in Delhi, but when that show went live, it went viral! They decided to air it across India! After that, i got work in radio, TV & films
 Soon ‘gutthi' happened & in no time, became a household name! i remember i was called on a live show & when i went on stage, the audience was roaring for me! i turned to make sure there wasn't anyone else, whom they were clapping for–but it was all for me
 It took several moments like that, to bring back that young boy in me, who used to think that he could conquer the world
 The young boy who used to make sure that everyone around him was smiling & entertained
 The young boy who did not failures dim his dreams & overpower his need for victory
 So even though I've come this far
 
 
 this young boy has a long way to go

 ' theatre main apni masters puri karne ke baad main mumbai aa gaya

 :) - Kapil Mishra (@kapilmishraaap) May 15, 2017 Earlier, Kapil's mother had called Kejriwal a liar
 unhone baqayada kapil ne naam khulaa khat likhakar unki aalochana kii thi
 Kapil's mother wrote that on the third day of Khatkapil Mishra's fast, Kejriwal had reached Annapurna Mishra, the mother of Kapil Mishra
 bijepi kii parshad or purvi dilli nagar nigam kii purv mahayor dow
 Annapurna Mishra accused Arvind Kejriwal of lying
 anshan sthal se anupama mishra ne kejariwal ke naam khulaa khat padhaa
 Kapil's mother, reading the letter in an emotional manner, said, 'his son is only an agent of truth and he is proud of him
 kejariwal ko bhagwaan se darana chahie
 Remember, when you came to my house that i wanted to take Kapil to the party, i did not agree to contest elections
 wo keval andolan karnaa chahta tha, tab tum aaye the mere paas ki kapil kii jarurat he
 Today your people are also calling me corrupt
 tum chup ho
 Kapil Mishra is currently on hunger strike
 unhone kejariwal par bhrashtachar jaise tamaam gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Kapil Mishra has also complained against Kejriwal in ACB and CBI
 jab kapil mishra aspataal se baahar aae to unase patrakaron ne sunita kejariwal ke twit ke bare main poochna chaha lekin unhone ye kahkar kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya ki mahilaon ko jawaab dena unke sanskaron main nahin
 Kapil said, 'she can speak
 mere sanskaro main kisi kii patni kisi kii mataji ke bare main bolnaa nahi sikhaaya gaya he
 'kapil Mishra, a minister in the Delhi government and a former Kejriwal special, knows that if he had given any reply to Sunita Kejriwal's tweet, the Aam Aadmi Party would have made it an issue, so Kapil saved himself from some new controversy

 Ravi Shankar Prasad said in the Lok Sabha that according to the 2011 census there are 296 Anglo Indians in the country
 unhone kaha ki anglo indian ke liye ek praavdhaan bhi he, lekin aaj is bill main ise nahin laayaa gaya
 However, mps of Congress, DMK, TMC and BJD protested and said the minister's data was grossly exaggerated
 congresski saansad hibi eden ne essi / asti samudaayon ke liye aarakshan ke vistaar kaa samarthan to kiya lekin unhone ye bhi kaha ki mantri ne sadan ko gumraah kiya he
 My constituency alone has over 20,000 Anglo Indians
 TMC kaa virodatrinmul congresske saugat raay ne kaha ki yah asanvaidhanik pravriti kaa vidheyak he

 Although Muslims are majority in other countries, protests are going on in entire country against Minorities Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 in India
 vahiin kai raajnneetik partiyaan jinhone sadan ke andar naagarikta sanshodhan bill ke samarthan main vot kiya tha ab unke rukh main achaanak hi badlaav dekha ja rahaa he
 The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Punjab, says Muslims should also be included in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), our country is secular, so it is not right to exclude just one religion
 
 haalanki, is kanoon kaa swaagat karte hue akali dal ke pravaktaa dalajit singh cheema ne kaha ki ye bill pratadit alpsankhyakon kii madad karegaa lekin isamen muslim samudaay ke logon ko bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 The party spokesperson said, "this bill will give place to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, Christians who have been tortured in pakistan-afghanistan-bangladesh, this is absolutely true
" lekin, iskaa doosraa pahalu bhi ye he ki muslim isamen shaamil nahin hai
 'our party has clearly said that Muslims should also have a place in this law, our constitution is secular
 samvidhan kahata he ki kisi bhi dharm ke vyakti ke saath anyaay nahin hona chahie
 The Akali Dal, along with this, protested the violence against the law across the country
 isliye shiromani akali dal ne liya you-turanswaal uthta he ki aakhir shiromani akali dal ne you turn kyon le liya? or ab wo muslim samudaay ke prataditon ko bhi is kanoon ke antargat laane kii baat kyon kar rahe hai?iske do kaaran hai
 Even if the population of Muslims in Punjab is 1
 93 pratishat he lekin wo anishchit voters (swing voters) hai
 Secondly, Ahmadiyya is a stronghold of Muslims in Gurdaspur in Punjab, the foundation of this community was found in the town of Qadian
 is bich sukhbir badal ne kaha, 'kai musalmaan bharat main pichley teen dashakon se rah rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is not right to deprive them of abstinence or to abolish their citizenship
 'muslimon ko baahar rakhana thik nahin- jatthedaar sinhavahin akaal takht jatthedaar singh kaa is kanoon ko lekar kahana he ki sikh samudaay ke log dharm or jati ke naam par kisi ke saath bhedbhaav nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, it is not right to exclude Muslims from the Citizenship Amendment Act
 unhone aage kaha, 'muslim, pakistan, afghanistan or bangladesh main bhale hi bahusankhyak ho lekin bharat main ye sabhi alpsankhyak hai
 Therefore, they cannot be kept separate
 'jaankaar maanate hai ki puure bharat main ahmadiya samudaay kii aabaadi maatr 15 lakh he
 Apart from Kadian in Punjab, Delhi, Mumbai and Chandigarh also live in this community
 inamen se zyaadaatar log sampann or samrudh hai or wo landan main jaakar bas gaye hai
 In such a situation, the separation of people from this community may harm India
 bharat main inaki aabaadi zyada nahin he lekin inako bhi is kanoon ke antargat laaye jane se vishwa kii raajnneeti main bharat ko bada phayda ho saktaa he

 shridevi kii achaanak mrityu se sara desh sadame main he
 On Saturday, at the age of 54, Sridevi breathed her last in Dubai
 wo vahaan ek shaadi ke samaaroh main shirkat karne gai hui thim jahaan unka nidhan ho gaya
 Sridevi's sudden departure like this is very sad
 fitness ko lekar behad sajag rahane vaali shridevi kii maut ke peeche cardiyak arest ko hi vajah mana ja rahaa he
 After all, what is a cardiac arrest that can bring even a healthy and healthy person to death? Let's know
 
 
 shridevi ke nidhan ke baad soshal media par viral ho raheen ye 12 tasvirenkya hota he cardiyak arestismen dil ke bheetar vibhinn hisson ke bich soochnaaon kaa aadan-pradaan gadabad ho jaataa he, jisaki vajah se dil kii dhadkan par bura asar padataa he
 Heart rate is regulated through jacardiopulmonary resistance (CPR)
 jin logon ko pehle heart atake aa chukaa he, unhen cardiyak arest aane kii aanshaka zyada rahati he
 Sridevi underwent 29 surgeries to look beautiful, was this the cause of death? Different people in heart attack and cardiac arrest consider these two as one, but they are different
 heart atake ke dauraan hriday ke kuch hisson main khun kaa bahaav jam jaataa he jis vajah se heart atake hota he
 On the other hand, due to any reason in cardiac attack, the heart stops functioning properly and stops suddenly
 cardiyak arest ke lakshan-hriday kaa dhakdhakanathkaan kaa ehsaas honasaanson kaa chota honaahruday main dard mahasoos honachakkar aanin kaarnon se bad saktaa he cardiyak arest kaa khatradiabetidhumrapancholesterol kaa badhanadainik jivan main kasarat, yoga or vyaayaam ko shaamil nahin karnahai bladpressure or hisertensionshridevi ne khubasurat dikhne ke liye karai thim 29 surgery, kya yahi baniin maut kii vajah?saden cardiyak atake se bachaavaisa mahasoos hone par turant doctor se sampark karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 It is possible to treat it with the help of cardiopulmonary resection (CPR)
 haalanki saamaanya doctor defibrilator kii madad se bhi iskaa ilaaj kar sakate hai
 If positive steps are taken at the right time, then human life can also be saved
 jab ham chote hote hai to hamen lagata he ki pita hona kitna aasaan he
 We just have to go to office and come home and scold us
 par bade hone ke saath hi hamen ye ehsaas hota he ki hamaare papa kitne ameging hai
 How easily they handle everything
 ham sabhi ke pita hamaare pehle superhiro hote hai
 His every thing affects us
 par super fadar bananaa itnaa aasaan bhi nahin
 Would like to know how Superfather: 1
 bacchon kii baaten sunne valeiskaa matlab ye nahin ki wo sirf bacchon se gap ladaate hai
 Anyone can do this
 super fadar apane bacchon kii baton se unki pasand-naapsand kaa andaja lagaate hai
 From these things, they try to understand how their child thinks on something
 bachche ke achche-bure har vakt main wo bachche ko sunate hai or sunne ke saath hi apni raay bhi dete hai
 Gives opinion, does not impose
 2
 Interest in children is also their interest
 Good fathers take full care of their children's likes and dislikes
 aksar pita chaahate hai ki unka baccha bhi vahi hobij apanaaye jo unki hai, lekin super fadar bachche ko apni khud kii hobij chunane kaa mauka dete hai
 They not only give their children the right to dream, but also start living their dreams themselves
 ve apane bachche kii hobij or uske sapanom ke bare main zyada se zyada jaanane kii koshish karte hai
 3
 dekhbhaal karanexsar aisa mana jaataa he ki daantne kaa kaam pita kaa hota he aurpyar karne kaa maa kaa
 But a good father stays with his child every time he needs them
 pita ke saath hone par suraksha kaa ehsaas ye jataata he ki aapke pita aapaki kitni parvaah karte hai
 4
 apni jaruraton ko chhodkar bachche kii maang puri karnashaayad ye kaam har mata-pita karte hai
 Their preferences change after becoming parents
 jo shaks pita banane se pehle har maheene nae kapade kharidta tha, pita banane ke baad achaanak se wo chijen bina matlab kii lagane lag jaati hai
 These things are replaced by children's toys and science kits

 unhone kaha ki is bajet main sarkaar ne garibon, pichhadon, alpsankhyakon, chaatro, kisaanon or mazdooron ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 RJD chief Lalu also suddenly said that he is ready to support the CPI (M) if the CPI (M) does not ensure that the BJP does not vote on the cut motion presented by it
 iske baad donon hi partiyon ke sadsy baari hangaame ke bich sadan se vakout kar gayi
 The House rejected the cut motion of Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj, associated with the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, by 246 votes against 162 and cpi's Gurudas Dasgupta's cut proposal from the same ministry by 289 votes against 201

 On the other hand, Speaker Meira Kumar introduced the deduction proposals of tax members one by one and then the long process of division of votes started
 adhyaksh ne sabase pehle petroleum evam prakritik gas mantralay se jude vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ke katautee prastaav par mat vibhaajan karaayaa, jise sadan ne 162 ke mukaable 246 maton se naamanzoor kar diya
 After this, he announced the division of votes on Gurudas Dasgupta of CPI on the deduction proposal related to the same ministry, but due to technical fault votes could not be recorded
 is par sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal ne sadasyon se aagrah kiya ki ve ek saath saare katautee prastaavon par parchi ke jariye mat vibhaajan karaane kii anumati den jisase sadan ke netaa pranav mukherjee or vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa ne sahmati vyakt kii

 baad main hue mat vibhaajan main dasgupta ke katautee prastaav ko sadan ne 201 ke mukaable 289 maton se naamanzoor kar diya
 The House then rejected all other cut motions by voice and gave their approval to the Demands for Grants of Ministries and Departments

 Before the Guillotine on the Demands for Grants, the Speaker informed the House that he had received a letter from Dasgupta of the CPI, in which he also spoke about the right of the members to move the cut motions on the Ministries on which the House It has not been discussed

 kam hi logon ko pataa he ki bollywood main kismat aajamaane se pehle megaster amitabh bachchan radio prastota bananaa chaahate the or iske liye vah ol india radio ke mumbai studio audishan dene bhi gaye the
 Famous radio announcer Amin Sayani, who is making a comeback to the radio with his new show 'stars of Jawiyaan', said that he did not have time to meet Amitabh then, as the actor had not already taken time for the voice audition
 sayaani ne ek saakshaatkaar main kaha, ‘yah 1960 ke dashak ke aakhir main kabhi hua tha, jab main ek hafte main 20 kaarykram karata tha
 Every day, most of my time was spent in the sound studio, as i was involved in every process of radio programming
 ek din amitabh bachchan naam kaa ek yuvak bina samay liye wois audishan dene aayaa
 'he said,' i had absolutely no time for that thin skinny person
 usne intjaar kiya or laut gaya, iske baad bhi vah kai baar aayaa
 But i could not meet him and kept saying through the receptionist that he should come back earlier
 ' 81 varshiya sayaani ko baad main pataa chalaa ki vah amitabh the, jo audishan ke liye unke karyaalay aate the
 When Sayani saw a trial show in the film 'anand' (1971), he was impressed by Amitabh's personality and voice and then he did not know that it was Amitabh who came for the audition
 is film main amitabh ke saath rajesh khanna ne kaam kiya tha
 Sayani said, "amitabh came as the chief guest at an award ceremony and he recalled going back to the radio station to audition thrice remembering his struggles and said that he was not even allowed to sit in the audition

 Later when i interviewed him, we discussed it long and laughed

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has recently won 12 out of 14 seats in the Lok Sabha elections in Jharkhand
 lekin loksabhaa or vidhansabha ke chunaavon main alag-alag nattejey dene vaale is rajya ke anuthe record ko dekhte hue use apane paanv jameen par hi rakhane chahie
 While other parties, who have failed to leave their mark, can now expect something
 pichhlaa itihaas sab kuch bayaan kar detaa he
 In the 14th Lok Sabha election of 2004, the Congress-led UPA had unilaterally won 13 seats in the state and the BJP led by the state government had only one seat
 lekin iske aath maah baad hi vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey bilkul ulat aae
 The bjp-led NDA emerged as the largest alliance by winning 36 seats in the state's 82-seat assembly
 akele bijepi ko 30 siten mili thim jo congress or jharkhand mukti morcha (jeemem) ko mili kul siton se zyada thim
 Similarly, in the 15th Lok Sabha elections of 2009, BJP got eight seats in the state, but only six months later when the assembly elections were held, JMM returned as the single largest party
 chunaavon main voting ke rukh main ekarupata na rahane or loksabhaa chunaavon se ulat nateezon ke record ke isse kahin gahare or gudh myne hai
 According to a state intelligence official, the reason for the conflicting voting pattern is that the voter has a national outlook while choosing the central government
 adhikari ne kaha, ''yahi vajah he ki rajya ne 2004 ke aam chunaavon main saaf taur se congress or 2009 main bijepi ke paksh main matdaan kiya tha
 Clarity of choices is disturbed in assembly elections, where regional aspirations and identity politics define the behavior of voters
 ÓÓ duusari vajah yah he donon rashtriya partiyon ke paas rajya main acchhee khyaati vaala netaa nahin he
 The trust of the Congress and BJP factions runs, so they do not get the trust of the voters
 unke vipareet kshetreey partiyaan jaise babulal marandi kii jharkhand vikaas morcha (jeviem), sudesh mahato kii ajasu or shibu sorain kii jeemem ke vichaaron or netritv main spashtataa he
 Hence the electorate selects them over the national parties in the assembly elections
 jamini str par loksabhaa chunaav ke kareeb ek maah baad hi rajya main raajnneeti kii handi chuulhe par chadh chuki he or sabhi pramukh partiyaan chunavi rang main aa rahi hai
 The challenge before the BJP is to maintain the positive air in favor of the party in the Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin do loksabhaa siten jeetne vaale jeemem ke saamne hemanth sorain ke naam par vot paane kii chunauti he, jo rajya main lokapriy sarkaar nahin de paae hai
 The Lok Sabha election results and Hemant's unpopularity have shaken the JMM
 rajya main november main vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai or bijepi ko acha pradarshan dohraane se rokane ke liye sorain congress, jeemem or argedy chunaav-purv gathbandhan bananaa chaahate hai
 On the other hand, Congress, AJSU, JVM and RJD are busy trying to fix the figures in this traditional field
 bijepi ko bhi nuksaan hone kii ashanka he
 There is a buzz that BJP leader Arjun Manda will not be the Chief Minister's candidate this time as veteran party leader Yashwant Sinha is showing interest in the politics of his home state
 purv up-mukhyamantri raghuvar das ek or majboot ummidavaar ho sakate hai jo is baar sheersh pad ke liye chupchaap apana daanv chal rahe hai
 If Yashwant's age comes in the way, then Das can emerge as a hidden Rustom for this post
 party ke kai varisht netaaon ne aise bayaan die hai ki ab adivasee mukhyamantri laane kii parampara ko band kiya jayega
 This may make the road difficult for the Arjun Munda and his supporters in the BJP
 bijepi ke netaa yah bhi jaanate hai ki sansadeey chunaav rashtriya masalon par lade jate hai
 a BJP leader said, "in the state assembly elections, the matter is completely different, if the BJP is not able to maintain the atmosphere then the upcoming challenges could shatter the party
" haalanki, yashavanth sinha ne rajya main bijli kii kharaab aapurti ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya he or hazaribagh main giraftaar ke baad unhen logon kii sahanubhuti hasil hui he, lekin itnaa kaaphi nahin he
 "the date for elections for the state assembly has not been announced yet, but it is likely to be held in November this year

 Shibu Soren and his son Hemant have met Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi and tried to persuade her that it is appropriate to maintain an alliance with the Congress for the upcoming assembly elections
 sorain ne tark diya ki ve ekajute hokar hi rajya main bijepi ko aane se roak sakate hai
 According to sources, Sonia has not given any assurance to him yet
 pradesh congress ne is bare main nakaaratmak sandesh die hai
 AJSU, headed by Sudesh Mahato, has started its one-month postcard campaign in which the Prime Minister has been requested to accord special status to the state
 usne 12 jilon main apane party pramukhon ko badal diya he
 Sudesh Mahato said, "there is also a plan for a major reshuffle in the organization
 " jharkhand kii kshetreey partiyon ko yadi phir se ubhar rahi, lekin dhadon main banty bijepi ko rokna he to unhen kadi mehnat se saamaajik gathjod or rajnatik gathbandhan karne honge

 yahi vajah he ki jahaan ek taraf puja ke baad mandir kii diwaar par ulta swaastik banaakar ganpati tak pahunchaayi jaati he apni manokamana or ichha puri hone par bhakt yahaan aakar banaate hai sidhaa swaastik
 On the other hand, some devotees tie their molly and also say to Bappa their wish
 ujjain ke malwa kshetra main ganpati kaa kya sthaan he is baat kaa andaja aap isi baat se laga sakate hai ki ilaake main koi bhi shaadi ho pehla nimantran vinayak ke is darbar main aata he
 The bride's parents first come and write the date of the ascendant to the priest, then the newly married couple begin their marital life only with the blessings of Ganapati
 vaise to madhya pradesh main ganpati ke anginat mandir hai lekin bappa kaa ye dham sabase ooncha sthaan rakhata he ek chat ke neeche vinayak ke teen teen roopon kaa aashirwad praapt kar bhakt apane bhagya ko saraahna nahin bhoolatey
 It is very easy to please Chintamani Ganesh of Ujjain and to get the blessings he wants
 motichur ke laddu se bhagwaan kii aradhana kar mandir ke peeche kii diwaar par ulta swastik bana diya jaae to muraad puri hote der nahin lagati
 It is said that Lord Ram and Sita came here in Tretayug to seek the blessings of Lord Ganpati
 bhakton kii har manokamana puri karne vaale chintamani ke darbar kii har baat niraali he
 The iconic Bappa form in the temple is so attractive that devotees do not let it disappear from their eyes even for a moment
 mandir parisar se uthne vaali mantron or ghantiyon kii dhwani kaanon main ek alag mithaas ghol detii he
 After coming here, the devotees get all their funeral pyre at the feet of Bappa and get relieved
 subah-savere mandir ke pat khulne ke saath hi mandir main chintaman, icchaaman or siddhivinayak ke swaroopon kii aradhana kaa daur shuru ho jaataa he jo raat tak jari rahata he
 As soon as the pat is opened, the priest of the temple anoints Lord Chintaman with water, after which milk, ghee and panchamrit are offered to the Lord
 panchamrita se chintaman, icchaaman or siddhivinayak ke abhishek ke baad murti par ghi or sindur kaa lep kar kiya jaataa unka bhavy shringaar
 There are also many devotees who make up the chintaman on the wish fulfillment here, from silver work to attractive laces, and then the procession of Aarti starts in the court of devotee Bappa to hear the sweet echo Stand for hours

 After the new formation of selection commissions and recruitment boards, the state government is going to start the new-old recruitment process for more than two lakh posts (see box) in the next one year
 sarkaar ke saamne sabase badi chunauti pichhali sarkaron ke kaarykaal ke dauraan vivaadon main ghiri chayan prakriyaaon kii vishwasaneeyata behaal karne kii he
 State Chief Secretary Anoop Chandra Pandey says, "A transparent system has been established in all the selection processes of the state
 sarkaar ne ek phulpuraf system taiyaar kiya he
 The Commission changed the manner in which the State Public Service Commission, the most prestigious selection body of the state, was the most disputed in the previous SP government

 likhit pariksha main behad kamjor pradarshan karne vaale abhyarthiyon ko intervyuu main zyada ank dekar chayan yogya bana diya jaataa tha
 "on receiving the complaint of rigging in the interview, the Commission has now reduced its marks from 200 to 100

 Constant changes in the examination process and the non-adoption of the procedure of the Union Public Service Commission were also raising questions on the State Public Service Commission

 In 2002, the first question paper was multiple choice and the second long answer
 2004 main donon prashnptr bahuviklpiya kar die gaye
 Since then, the examination has been done on the same pattern, while the Union Public Service Commission has been continuously amending them
 ab ayog ne sangh lok seva ayog kii tarj par pisies-2018 kii mukhya pariksha karaane kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 Now the four questions in PCS main examination will be long answer

 Soon after assuming power in the state, the BJP government had ordered to end the interview from the recruitment examinations

 There were 500 posts in which the results were not released after the written examination and 10,000 posts in which only advertisements were printed

 "the Commission has six boards for interviews which are headed by the members of the Commission
" har board main do visheshgy hai
 The Commission has taken several new steps to prevent any disturbances in the interview process
 paliwal bataate hai, ''board ke kisi sadsy ko yah pataa nahin hota ki ve kis chaatr kaa intervyuu lene ja rahe hai
 The board has been asked not to ask the candidate about the name or the area of his residence under any circumstances
 ''board ke chairman or donon sadsy intervyuu main number denge
 The average of the given number of these three will be the number given to the candidate

 For the first time, eight sets of question papers are being prepared, so that the sequence of questions is not the same in the question papers of the candidates sitting side by side

 Targeting the upcoming FRDI law of the central government, the Aam Aadmi Party said that the Narendra Modi government of the country is now going to give another big blow to the people of the country, first put people in the line of banks in the name of demonetisation and the poor
 The money has been deposited in the bank and now Modi ji has prepared to grab your same money
 modi sarkaar ek aisa kanoon sansad main pesh karne vaali he jiske lagu hone ke baad bainkon main jamaa aapkaa sara paisa bank hadap jaaegi or aap kuch nahin kar paaenge
 Addressing the press conference at the party office, the party's national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said that "the debate has been waged on the one hand by dividing the society on the basis of communalism in the country and the public attention has been deliberately diverted towards these unnecessary issues and on the other side of the country The Modi government is preparing to bring a law through the thief way that will act as a nuclear bomb on the bank accounts of the people of this country
 aap pravaktaa ne kaha ki modi ji ne jandhan yojana, notebandi, phir apane hi acount se paisa nikaalane kii seemaa tay karnaa or ab FRDI kanoon
 This series shows that Modi ji has a policy and that 'take out the money of the poor and put it in the pockets of industrialists and Dhanaseths' and after the name of FRDI this law is implemented, we should keep our money in any bank First the financial condition of that bank also has to be taken care of
 bade udyogpati agar bainkon se liya lakhon-karod rupye kaa lone bank ko waapas nahin lautaate hai to us nuksaan kii bharpai wo bank janata dwaara jamaa kiye gaye paise se karegaa or udyogpatiyon kaa sara lone maaf kar diya jayega
 This means that these banks will grab the money of the hard earned money of the general public for loaning industrialists
 agar aapke bank acount main jamaa kiya gaya aapkaa paisa (jo aapane apane budhaape yaa phir kisi beemaari yaa phir bacchon kii padhai yaa phir shaadi ke liye rakhaa hoga) wo paisa is kanoon ke lagu hone ke baad kabhi bhi dub saktaa he
 Without asking you, your money will be grabbed
 Now bail-out is going to become bail-in for the bank
 matlab, pehle jab koi bada udyogpati kisi bank ko lone waapas nahin karata tha or bank kangaali kii kagaar par aa jaati thi to sarkaar apni jeb se paise dekar us bank kii madad karti thi jise bel-out package bhi kehete hai lekin ab is kanoon ke jariye bel-in system bana diya jayega yani desh ke aam logon kaa paisa jo unke bank khaaton main jamaa he, use bank hadap legaa or udyogpatiyon kaa lone maaf karte hue apane nuksaan kii bharpai kar legaa, ye sabakuch aapaki marji ke bina kiya jayega
