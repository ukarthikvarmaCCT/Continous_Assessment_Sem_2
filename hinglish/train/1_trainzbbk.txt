 unka iraadaa hamen maarane kaa nahin, balki hamen is ilaake se khadedane kaa he
 a senior Congress MLA agrees, but does not want to reveal his name
 ve kehete hai, ''bodo logon kaa aglaa nishaanaa adivasee honge
 The Bodos do not want any non-bodos on their land
 jald hi ve alag bodo rajya ke liye apana andolan shuru karenge or tab unke ilaake main unka virodh karne vaala koi nahin hoga

 The Bhalka pilgrimage in Saurashtra of Gujarat testifies to Lord Krishna, the greatest hero of the Dwapar era, who told the world the knowledge of the Gita and the truth of life and his last moments
 yahi wo paavan sthaan he, jahaan sristi ke paalanhaar krishna ne apana sharir tyaagaa tha
 Bhalka shrine is just 5 km from Somnath temple, one of the two lingas present in Saurashtra, Gujarat
 duuri par he
 The idol of Lord Shri Krishna built in this temple tells his last time
 dharmik manyataon ke mutabik, isi jagah par bhagwaan shrikrishna ko ek baheliye ke tir ne bhed diya tha or unke saamne hi sthapit he us baheliye kii haath jode, kshamaa maangate hue pratimaa, jo krishna par baan chalaakar pachhataa rahaa tha
 But Krishna was an inner being
 wo bakhubi jaanate the ki sansar ko apane ishaaron par bhale wo chalaate hon lekin ab is duniya se unke chalane kaa samay aa gaya he
 That is why he forgave the fowler who shot the arrow
 baan lagane se ghayal bhagwaan krishna bhalka se thodi dur par sthit hiran nadi ke kinare pahunche
 The Deer River is just one and a half kilometers from Somnath
 kaha jaataa he ki usee jagah par bhagwaan panchtatv main hi villin ho gaye
 From there the Lord went directly to Baikunth Dham
 lekin hiran nadi ke kinare aaj bhi bhagwaan ke charnon ke nishaan maujuud hai or jo duniya bhar main dehotsarg tirth ke naam se mashhoor he
 But the place is also no less important, from where the fowler had targeted the god as a deer
 samudr ke kinare based us jagah ko bannganga kehete hai or vahaan par ab samudr ke bheetar shivlinga bana hua he
 Although the Bhalka shrine is a witness to the last days of Lord Shri Krishna, but even today, this holy pilgrimage site is a major religious center fulfilling the wishes of the devotees
 aaj bhi hajaaron kii sankhya main krishna bhakt har roj yahaan aate or ye manyata he ki sachche man se maangi gai koi bhi muraad yahaan kabhi ansuni nahin rahati
 In order to relieve the pain and suffering of his devotees, the God who has incarnated again and again, even though he had made up his mind to abandon the world from this place, but the feeling of his existence is still in the minds of devotees

 Government efforts to hold the price of lentils are constantly failing
 yahaan tak ki daal ke aayaat kaa bhi koi phayda hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 The government has brought a far-fetched price to stop the price of pulses
 ab wo africa or myanmar main khet kharidne kii soch rahi he jahaan daal ugaai jaaegi
 Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan told NDTV, "we will talk to Myanmar and Mozambique governments about what is possible about this
" varisht adhikariyon kaa do dal isi hafte in donon deshon kaa daura karegaa
 It will also include officials of other ministry
 " In fact, all government efforts to control the prices of lentils did not work
 sarkaar ne badi maatra main daal aayaat kii - beete teen maheene main 14000 ton se zyaada arhar or urad daal baahar se mangai gai, lekin wo sarkari dukaanon yaa godaamon main hi rakhi gayi hai, desh kii badi mandiyon main nahin pahunchi hai
 Anand Garg, vice-chairman of the Delhi Grain Traders Association, told NDTV that the government took strict action against dal traders and acted on stock holding limits
 
 
 uske baad vyapaaree utana zyaada aayaat ab nahin kar rahe
 On the other hand, the government which is importing thousands of tons of pulses is not reaching the market
 nateeja ye he ki daal ke daam kam nahin ho rahe
 In Delhi, urad dal is being sold for Rs 161 a kg
 jabaki mangalore main to 200 rupee ke kareeb pahunch gai he- 196 rupee main bik rahi he; bengalooru main bhav bas ek rupee kam he- 195 rupye or bathinda main 185 rupee kilo he
 The problem is that most states are not ready to buy the pulses that the Center has ordered from outside
 jabaki wo sirf 66 rupee kilo kii rate par unako di ja rahi he
 Minister of State for Agriculture Sanjeev Balayan told NDTV, "the central and state governments will have to work together to control the prices of pulses
 distribution kaa sara adhikaar rajya sarkaron ke paas he
 If they do not take the initiative seriously then it will not be possible to control the prices
 " The problem is also that many state governments do not have the capacity to process thousands of tons of raw teams by purchasing them from the center at cheap rates
 ye bhi ek vajah he ki aadhe se adhik rajya sarkaron ne saste daron par daal kendra se nahin kharida he

 The indo-tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has started operations against Naxalites in Rajnandgaon, Chhattisgarh
 is oparation se naksaliyon kii neend udi hui he
 Normally, Naxalites used to flee to neighboring states after the operation started
 lekin is baar ITBP sthaneey police kii madad se vahaan bhi dabish de rahi he
 The Naxals who fled Chhattisgarh often took refuge in Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh and Gondia and Gadchiroli areas of Maharashtra
 lekin ab aisa nahin ho paaegaa
 Actually, ITBP has increased the vigil in the border areas of both the states

 There is often a lot of discussion about the votes of Muslims before any election
 uske baad unke pratinidhiyon kii sankhya gini jaati he, jo desh main loktantr kii jaden majboot hone ke saath hi ghatati-badhati rahati hai

 dilli main 12 fisadi aabaadi vaale samudaay ke vidhayakon kii sankhya kam hone par sawaal uthanaa laazmi he
 It is said that the larger the number, the greater the participation in democracy
 phir aisa kyon hua? awwal, aap ne paanch musalamaanon ko hi pratyaashee banaaya tha, jinamein chaar jeet gaye
 Second, Muslims had realized that only you can defeat BJP
 teesraa, samudaay ne hameshaa ‘secular’ partiyon or insaaf pasand netaaon ko tarjeeh di he, netaa kaa muslim yaa sajaateey hona kabhi uski praathamikta nahin rahi
 Fourth, Muslims have never voted unilaterally, though like other communities, it also wants to preserve political existence
 yahi chahat matdaan ke ain pehle samudaay ke zyaadaatar logon ko kisi ek party ko samarthan dene ke liye majaboor karti he
 In addition, Muslims, except for BJP or Sangh-backed parties, have voted for various parties in the same way as people from the majority community have supported

 In such a situation, this community did not have a better option than you in Delhi
 unhen maaloom tha ki arvind kejariwal hi bijepi ke vijay rath ko roak sakate hai

 dilli main skool-collejon or aspataalon kii sankhya badhanaa chaahate hai
 Most people of the most self-employed community found the AAP better than the Congress
 isse un congressiyon ko raahat jarur milegi jo yah kah rahe the ki party kii chhavi alpsankhyakwaadi ho gai he, haalanki centre main unke kaarykaal ke dauraan musalamaanon kii haisiyat bharat ke ‘nae dalit’ kii ho gai
 And yes, the party disappeared from the Delhi Assembly due to the lack of Muslim support
 dilli main 10 vidhansabha kshetron main musalamaanon kii sankhya 20 fisadi se zyada he
 In five of these, they are more than 30 percent
 itane se ve na to sarkaar bana sakate hai na gira sakate hai
 Then, the MLA belongs to any community, he cannot talk away from the partyline
 agar partline is samudaay kii jaruraton ke anuroop ho to muslim vidhayakon kii sankhya bahut mahatv nahin rakhti
 In such a situation, this community maintains its political existence through tactical voting
 musalamaanon ne force multiplir kii bhoomika nibhaakar phir apane siyaasi vajood kaa ehsaas kara diya

 unhone centre par nishaanaa sadhate hue aarope lagaaya ki samprag sarkaar pradesh ke saarvajanik jivan ko ‘nasht’ karne ke liye rajyapal jaise sanvaidhanik pad kaa durupyog kar rahi he
 Modi also said that Gujarat would not bow down to the 'delhi Sultanate'
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘is dilli sultanate ko saavdhaneepurvak yah baat sunanaa chahie, gujarat dilli ‘darbar’ ke aage kabhi ‘mujra’ nahin karegaa
 Those days did not last (depending on the fund of the center)
 ham koi diwalia rajya nahin hai
 Addressing a public meeting after a day long 'sadbhavna Mission' fast in this city of South Gujarat, he said, 'use all constitutional bodies, constitutional posts against us and take care that there is no delay in their use
 ’modi ne kaha, ‘samasya yah he ki gujarat ke logon ne pichley kai saal se congress ko kuch bhi nahin diya he or yahi vajah he ki ve (congress netaa) mujhe nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 'he said,' i tell the people of Gujarat that they should not give anything to the Congress
 hamaare saath gujarat ke chah karod logon kii duaen hai, koi bhi hamen parajeet nahin kar saktaa
 Modi alleged that the Center was misusing constitutional post like Governor to destroy the public life of Gujarat
 gauratlab he ki buudhvaar ko nyaayamurti viem sahay ne lokayukta kii niyukti ke mudde par rajya kii arji ko khaarij karte hue 2-1 se faisla sunaakar unhen ek tagada jhatka diya tha
 Justice Sahai had strongly criticized Modi and said that the Chief Minister's move on the Lokayukta issue reflects our 'destruction of democracy'
 nyaayadhish ne nyaayamurti (sevanivruth) aare mehta kii niyukti ko modi dwaara sweekaar nahin kiye jane ko irshyaalu or chunauteepurn bataate hue kaha ki yah kadam unki ore se hasil kii gai ek galat aparajeyata kii bhaavana ko darshata he
 Significantly, his appointment was advised by the Chief Justice of Gujarat High Court
 reatin4 stardiarectorsam mendeskalakaardaniel craig, monica beluchi, leyaa sidu, christoff woltz or dev batistaek baar phir sam mendes or danniel craig kii jodi saath ai he
 Earlier, the duo came together in 'skyfall', this time the pair has brought the 24th film of Jems Bondkadki
 sam mendes ne dikhaa diya he ki unke paas bond ke saath karne ke liye kaaphi kuch abhi baaki he
 That is why James Bond, who always rescues sixes of enemies with cars, plucks enemies with helicopters and planes throughout the film
 film ke pehle seen se lekar aakhri seen tak agent 007 ke hawaii kamaal jabardast hai
 The action is awe-inspiring, and the hard-core Craig Kreckka makes his character come alive
 apni pasandida car eshton martin par bhi unhone khub johar dikhaae hai
 Not only this, he also uses the plane this time and in his own style, takes the plane off the ice as well
 bataur bond danniel kii fitness or acting mjedaar he or isse unke homework kaa andaja achche se lag jaataa he
 storyjames Bondke has a mission
 jisamen hameshaa kii tarah uski mulaakaat haseen or khatarnaak ittephaakon se hoti he
 However, this time both Bond and Bond Girl are different than before and the concept of Bond Lady is also threaded in the film
 film kii shuruyaat mexico ke 'de of da ded' festival ke saath hoti he or yah bahut hi dilachasp seen he
 Hamonika Beluchene worked to put ghee in the fire or to create curiosity about the film
 unki sex apil to kamaal he hi screen par unki maujuudagi darshakon ke romaanch ko badhaane kaa kaam karti he
 However, his mafia widow's role is just three minutes
 yah thodaa khalataa he, ummid thode zyada kii thi
 Leia Sidoo, who has gained popularity with Blue Is the Warmest Color, looks good in her role and she walks shoulder-to-shoulder with Bond and breaks the rote-rote role of Bond Girl
 film kaa vau factor agar monica he to beraham villen ke kirdaar main dablyoodbalui resler batista ne dikhaa diya he ki vah film main bina bole bhi kaaphi kamaal kar sakate hai
 It is really fun to play with the merciless expressions and eyes on his face
 kah sakate hai ki ab vah sirf ek resler nahin ek achche expressant vaale actor bhi ho gaye hai
 His collision with Bond is tremendous
 film ke main villen hai inglorious bastard or 'jango anchend' ke liye auskar jeet chuke christoff woltz
 This is the first time Bond has a villain in the film who grew up with Bond
 unka bond ko torchar karne kaa andaaj kamaal he
 Christoph has shown that he can win hearts with his acting as a villain too
 film main bond ek mishan par he usee mishan kii vajah se vah landan, austria or rome main apane johar dikhaata he
 Though the story runs on many fronts and seems a bit drawn towards the end, but Bond's actions lighten this up a bit
 sam mendes kaa diarection kamaal he
 Interestingly, this week James Bond will compete with Salman Khan's 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo' as Bollywood is not releasing any major film this week
 har koi bhai kii film kii raah saaf karnaa chahta tha
 Anyway, the record of Hollywood films (furious-7, Jurassic World, Avengers and Mission Impossible) has been outstanding this year

 The stars have strongly condemned the incident and demanded action against the culprits
 lekin 'emes dhoni' star sushant singh rajput ne ek kadam aage badhate hue 'padmavati' ke samarthan main twitor par apane naam se apana sarnem hataa liya he
 The comments bataate chalem ki set par rajput karani sena ne hamalaa kiya tha, unka aarope tha ki film main itihaas ko tod marodakar dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 While the film's team has made it clear that there is no tampering with history
 is ghatana ke baad bhansaali ne jaipur main shooting radd kar di he
 The film stars Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor in lead roles
 sushant ne twitor par likhaa, 'ham tab tak bhugtenge jab tak ham apane sarnem kaa moh chhod nahin dete
 If you are so bold, then remove your surname in support from 'padmavati'
 ' is twit ko sushant ne apane timeline par pin kiya hua he
 We would suffer till the time we're obsessed with our surnames
 If you're that courageous,give us your first name to acknowledge
 # padmavati — Sushant (@itsssr) January 27, 2017 After this, Sushant wrote in a tweet on Sunday morning, 'there is no religion, no caste greater than humanity and love and kindness make us human
 iske alaava har bantwaaraa apane vyaktigat phaayde ke liye kiya jaataa he
 ' There is no religion or cast bigger than humanity and Love & compassion makes us human
 Any other division is done for selfish gains
 - Sushant (@itsssr) January 29, 2017 sushant ne ek or twit main likhaa, 'bhavishya main apni jagah banane ke liye log itihaas kii duhai dete hai, lekin unhen pataa nahin ki isse unka naam hameshaa ke liye bhula diya jayega
 ' People quote history to search for their relevance in future, not knowing that their names will surely be forgotten forever
 # selfmusing - Sushant (@itsssr) January 28, 2017 kuch dinon pehle hi sushant ne apni maa kii yaad main bhavuk note likhaa tha, unki maa kii maut saal 2002 main hi ho gai thi
 Sushant's last film was 'MS Dhoni: The Untold Story', in which he played the role of cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni

 Let us tell you that the set was attacked by Rajput Karni Sena, they alleged that the film is being shown by distorting history

 After this incident, Bhansali has canceled the shooting in Jaipur
 film main deepika padukon, ranvir singh or shahid kapur pramukh bhoomikaayen nibhaa rahe hai

 BJP said 'violation of the code of conduct' The BJP has already complained to the Election Commission that the implementation of the cash scheme is a violation of the code of conduct, which is intended to benefit the Congress in elections
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki kya bijepi kii daleelein chunaav ayog ke saamne tik sakengi
 The Bharatiya Janata Party's desire for good news from Uttar Pradesh was finally fulfilled
 vidhansabha chunaav ke jakhm sahala rahi bijepi ne nagar nikaay chunaavon main shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 The party has won 10 out of 12 terms of mayor
 party ke meyar kii sankhya pehle 8 thi
 The BJP has once again proved that its urban vote bank holds its place
 vahiin congress kaa is chunaav main safaya ho gaya
 She lost not only Amethi Rae Bareli in the areas of rahul-sonia Gandhi but also in Kanpur, the city of Union Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal, and Gonda in the area of beniprasad Verma
 rajya kii do mukhya partiyaan samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ne pehle hi elaan kar diya tha ki ve sidhe taur par sthaneey nikaay chunaav nahin ladengi

 Same was the case of MP Rajendra Agarwal from here
 unke ward main bhi party ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 There are two bodies in Charkhari of Mahoba, the constituency of Uma Bharti

 ' dilli main ek samvaadadaata sammelan yojit kar aap party ke vidhayak madan laal ne bhartiya janata party par aarope lagaaya ki party todane or arvind kejariwal kii sarkaar giraane ke liye bhaajapa ne 20 karod rupee kii peshkash kii thi
 Madan Lal alleges that people close to BJP leader Arun Jaitley came to him
 lekin, apane daawey ko pukhta karne ke liye madan laal ne koi saboot pesh nahin kiya
 At the same time, after these allegations of the AAP party, BJP leader Arun Jaitley denied the allegations by tweeting and said that the AAP party has been doing politics on lies from the beginning
 kasturbanagar se vidhayak aap party ke netaa madan laal ne kaha ki unhen sabase pehle 7 disambar ko ek aadmi kaa phone aayaa tha
 Lal alleges that on the phone the man had talked about meeting a 'powerful leader'
 bakaul laal, jab unhone us netaa kaa naam poocha tab saamne vaale ne arun jetali bataaya tha
 At this, Lal scolded the man and disconnected the phone
 bataa den ki saat taarikh ko chunaav parinaam kii ghoshnaa nahin hui thi
 The election results came exactly one day later
 madan laal kaa aarope he ki das din baad phir do aadmi unase milane aae jinhone khud ko narendra modi or arun jetali kaa aadmi bataaya or kaha ki nau vidhayak lekar agar aap alag dal banaate hai to sabhi vah mukhyamantri ban sakate hai or bhaajapa unhen sarkaar banane main puri madad karegi

 Sunny's presence brings glamor to the film
 lekin shaayad mekars bhul gaye ki darshakon kaa dil jeetne ke liye acchhee kahani kii bhi jarurat hoti he
 Let's review this film full of romance with sunny-arbaaz
 
 
 kahaneeyah kahani ek art gailaree chalaane vaali raunak (sani leyoni) kii he jisaki mulaakaat ek din painter vir (arbaj khan) se hoti he
 With the meeting, love begins to grow between the two
 vir kii painting banane kii kala se raunak bahut prabhavit hoti he or uski painting ko apni art gailaree main jagah de detii he
 One day when four of Raunak's clients come to him in search of a particular type of painting
 vahaan vir kii painting ko dekhakar chaaron client kaaphi khush hote hai or uski painting ke peeche pad jate hai
 Because they have to sell a painting to a foreign buyer for a million
 kahani main twist or terns bahut aate hai
 Now can these four clients force Veer to take the painting
 vir or raunak kii lav story kaa kya hota he? aakhir main koun-sa bada twist aata he yah jaanane ke liye to aapako film dekhni padegi
 Review: Bhatki's story, what Rai Laxmi's Julie 2 wanted to show in the director: The story of Kajam Kadian film is very clichéd
 pehle hi frem se boriyat mahasoos hone lagati he
 The script is very weak, along with the sync of dubbing of the actors is also very mismatched
 agar aap soch rahe hai ki edlt content hone ke saath-saath sani leyoni kii maujuudagi main aapako zyada bold seens dikhne ko milenge
 So believe me you will also be disappointed in this regard
 film main jabardastee ke sanvaadon kaa aadan-pradaan dikhaaya gaya he
 Looking at the film, a lot of money seems to have been wasted together
 jaaniye kyon dekhni chahie phildogar aap edlt hai, arbaj khan yaa sani leyoni ke bahut bade diwane hai or unki koi bhi film miss nahin karte to ekbar dekh sakate hai
 Otherwise, wait till you come on TV
 sudhaa chandran kaa kaam bhi sahi he

 is parivaar main sabhi sukhi hai
 Queen Elizabeth in marital status, divorcing her children
 britain kaa shahi parivaar agar ab bhi parivaar kehalaata he, to sirf isliye ki ishwar ne use shahi banaaya he
 Otherwise, what happened on the diamond jubilee of the coronation of the Queen was an unprecedented drama adorned with colorful costumes
 ek sadi se duusari sadi tak puure aatm-niyantran ke saath sarakati ai yah rajshahi saamaanya se bilkul alag he, or use aisa hi hona chahie
 After all, how can anyone think of wearing yellow trousers to be a part of history, except for one reason that he is the prince of the House of Windsor? Everything was as real as the country in which this incident was happening
 baaki sab hawa-hawaii tha
 Even nature does not know whether such an incident ever happened before
 landan kii barish apane kism kii anokhi hoti he
 This four-day exhibition began amid similar rain and dark clouds
 barish yahaan ke aam logon ko chaahe kitna hi sata le lekin majaal ki uski ek boond bhi maharani ke karine se sanvaare bal ko bikher sake? to jaise hi maharani us shahi nauke ke bheetar ghusane ke liye badhin, thodi der ke liye badal tham gaye
 The boat too, like Cleopatra herself, was engulfed in gold
 camere ke saamne khud ko kaaphi sahaj dikhaane kii koshish kar rahi ek darbari ne jab dekha ki ab barish ruk gai he, to usne puri izzat or nafasat ke saath maharani se puch daalaa, ''aap chaunki to nahin?'' bibisi, jo aam taur par shahi khandaan kii aisi baatcheet ke vakt aawaaj kam kar detaa he, usne achaanak is tippanee par aawaaj badha di or puraa britain utsaah kii lahar main dub gaya
 Another decade of history is named after the Queen
 maharani elizabeth dwitiya ke rajpaat par agar koi aam french lekhak tippanee karata, to shaayad is baat kii ore sanket jarur karata ki unke pita ne to india ko hi ganvaaya, lekin chah dashak main maharani ne tukdaa-tukdaa kar ke samoochaa samrajya hi apane haath se nikal jane diya jiskaa udai chaar sadi pehle hua tha jab elizabeth pratham ne spanish jahaji bede ko munhtod jawaab diya tha
 However such unnecessary things should be digested
 hamaari samakaleen elizabeth paramparawaadi bhi hai or yathartwaadee bhi, isiilie unhone samrajya se ek-ek kar nikalate jate rashtron kaa dard khud main jajb kar liya
 Empresses should not be sentimental, but there was only one thing in the six-decade coronation that pained them — when they were stripped of their private boat Britannia, which was given to the Queen in 1954 by pro-monarchy Winston Churchill, but in 1997, Tony Blair Snatched back
 yah iklauta mashhoor mauka tha jab maharani roi thim
 Or say they let their eyes become moist
 yah baat bahucharchit he ki maharani sirf res ke dauraan hi muskaraati hai
 There was no race this time, but on June 3, she was tweeting
 britain kaa house of windsar apni shaano-shaukat liye hue ab tak sirf isliye bachaa hua he kyonki isane ek aisi baat apane dimag main utaar lee he jise baaki europe kii rajshahi viraasat ab tak samaj nahin pai haih ki satta ke mukaable rasookh behatar hota he
 These empires never claimed victory during the twentieth century upsurge, so they cannot be held responsible for their defeat
 europea rajtantr ko pehle vishwa yuddh main kuch gahare jakhm mili jo 1918 main khatm hua tha
 During this time the monarchy in Russia collapsed
 austro-hungary main hopsburg khandaan bhi haar chukaa tha
 The Kaizar rulers had to surrender
 windsar khandaan ne rajanetaaon ke liye satta kii jameen khaali kar di
 The British monarchy knew that it had become irrelevant to the public
 lekin jab kabhi praja ke saath judaav kii baat aati he, to buckingham se aage dekh paanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 At the Diamond Jubilee celebrations no leader was allowed to go on stage, not even the democratically elected British Prime Ministers
 yahaan ek din ke liye loktantr chuttee par chalaa gaya tha
 Long awaited this day
 jab sari aatishbaajiyaan dhuaan ho gayi, band kii dhune tham gayi or agali subah sara kachra samet diya gaya, to kya bachaa? ek aisa arth, jise lafjon main nahin bayaan kiya ja saktaa
 The British people were feeling a little better - the symbol of their royalty had given them an impetus and given an opportunity to stand up to the swinging confidence
 avsaad akele angrejon ko nahin hota
 If we are happy today, in the midst of dissatisfaction and corruption in Delhi spread across the country, then he will either be optimistic or extremely foolish
 sochie ki agar hindustani janata apni rajasatta ke pratik se prerana or raahat paanaa chaahe, to uskaa aasraa koun hoga? pratibha patil! ummiido kii dhalaan kii yah intahaa hogi
 There is a solution
 kyon nahin ham britain kii maharani ko udhaar maang laate hai kuch dinon ke liye? sirf sardiyon main ham unhen apane yahaan rakhenge jab britain kaa mausam rahane laayak nahin hota
 They still feel happy to be associated with India
 unke jawaharaat isi bhartiya upmahadweep se aate hai: wo lahori hira, jo unhone hirak jayanti par chamkaaya tha, or kohinoor bhi
 Rashtrapati Bhavan, where he has to stay in Delhi, was also built by an Englishman, so he will not have any problem in living according to his own

 When Subodh Kant was asked about this, he said in a funny tone that it is a good thing that my age has reduced, i want to remain a Subodh Bhaiya

 The state BJP has filed a complaint before the Election Commission regarding this

 varsh 2008 main maine salmaan rushdi, jhumpa lahidi, kiran desai or manil suri jaise bhartiya lekhakon ke ek samooh ke saath ek reeding (pustak vaachan) kaarykram main hissaa liya tha taaki baraak obama ke chunaav ke liye 85,000 dollar kaa chanda jutaya ja sake
 This year we sat in the house
 varsh 2008 main jab obama kii jeet ke baad main aadhi raat ko neuyork kii sadakon par niklaa to sadak par har koi mujhe naachata-jhumata najar aa rahaa tha
 This week i watched the election results on TV with a group of writers, all of whom had voted for Obama, considering it their duty
 is baar mushkil se hi kisi vyakti main koi zyada utsaah najar aa rahaa tha
 Things have really changed
 aisa is vajah se he kyonki obama ke pehle kaarykaal ne un logon ko niraash kiya he jinhone unke liye sangharsh kiya tha
 He has sent more migrants back than any other president
 unhone vyaktigat rup se un logon kii hatya ko manjuuri di he jinhen ve aatankwaadi samajhate the (america nagarikon sahit) or maut kii is suchi ko unhone nyaayik punarvichaar ke liye bhejne ke laayak bhi nahin samajha
 The Torture Chamber of Guantanamo is still open and the israel-palestine peace process is in a coma
 unhone imigration, jalwaayu parivartan ke vidheyak or bandook niyantran kaa samarthan kiya he
 But they must fight more vigorously for such things, in which they have allegiance
 inke liye unhen apane kaarykaal main kaaphi pehle se sangharsh karnaa chahie tha
 They have tried to reach a compromise with a group of Congress who keep ideology above the national interest and they were just going to throw him out of the presidency
 mere liye is chunaav main sabase zyada dilasa dene vaali baat yah he: paise se aap pyaar yaa chunaav ko nahin kharid sakate
 Even all the magnates of the world could not make Romney President or win Republicans in the Senate
 lekin ab bhi chintaa kii kai baaten hai
 The presidential and congressional elections cost about $ 6 billion
 is dhan kaa bada hissaa aise korporation or unke maalikon ne netaaon ke abhiyaan par kharch kiya he jo aage apana kaam karaayenge
 In a healthy democracy, corporations and people are also allowed to communicate their issues to their mps on issues affecting themselves
 pehle sanshodhan se is abhivyakti kii swatantraaa kii guarantee di gai he
 But in reality there is no freedom of expression when one side can buy a megaphone and the other side shouts in the air until the throat is broken
 obama kii jeet kaa sabase bada parinaam yah hoga ki supreme court ab republican party kii shakha nahin ban paaegaa, agar paanch vot ke conservative bahumat vaale court main republican dwaara niyukt ek or justise aa jaataa to aisa ho saktaa tha
 This would not reverse the decision to legalize abortion (rowe v
 Wade) or cause another injury to bury Obama's healthcare bill
 court chaar or varshon ke liye surakshit ho gaya he yaa or bhi samay ke liye, yah is baat par nirbhar he ki republican aakhirkaar kab se spanish kaa class lenaa shuru karte hai
 This is believed to be due to the role of racial and linguistic minorities in this election
 latin america ke spanishbhashiyon ne democrats or obama kaa samarthan kiya he
 The Republicans have now become a party of 'angry white people', while in the words of one of their senators, America is a country where most of the children born this year were non-white
 aap unako fox news yaa radio par gussa jaahir karte sun sakate hai
 When i first came to this country in 1977, i did high school with such an angry white guise
 mere skool jane ke duusare din hi ek aisa hi naaraaz shwet ladkaa mere paas aayaa or usne kaha, 'linkan ko unhen kabhi bhi kheti-mazdooree se aaazaad nahin karnaa chahie tha
 'I was teased and bullied because i was not white
 main jackson hits main janasankhyikeey badlaav kii agrim pankti main tha, jo ab america main sabase vividhta vaala ilaaka ban gaya he
 But if you go to that school today, you will see that it is full of South Asians and Latin Americans, we won by a small number of strength
 jaisaa ki is hafte hamane puure desh main kiya he
 If i want to advance in American politics, i have to join the Republican Party
 america raajnneeti main bhartiya mul ke logon kii safalataa kaa yahi rasta he
 At least Bobby (piyush) Jindal and Nikki (namrata) Haley (both governors from the Republican Party) have the same message for their native peers
 iske mukaable ke padon par democratic party main koi bhi bhartiya nahin he, jabaki 70 fisadi bhartiya-americanyon ne obama ko vot diya he
 Republicans are now looking for highly educated minorities whom they can present as the new face of the party (even if the mind, heart, torso and other organs remain completely white)
 obama kaa phir se chunaav 5
 The opposite of the aspirations of 70 million Americans (about half of the electorate) has happened
 aise bahut se log vastav main naaraaz hai—apane hi desh main haashie par pahunch jane par naaraaz hai, is baat se naaraaz hai ki ve apane maa-baap se kam kama rahe hai, is baat se naaraaz hai ki unka desh 21veen sadi main us tarah se prabhutv nahin rakhata he jaise ki beesvin sadi main uskaa prabhutv tha
 But at the same time, only five percent of the voters said that foreign policy is the most important matter for them
 pashchim asia or kabhi-kabhi china kii charchaa ko chhod den to kisi bhi pratyaashee ne bharat, latin america yaa australia yaa duniya ke anya deshon ke bare main bolne par jaraa bhi samay nahin diya he
 In the second term, Obama will have to make his country realize the dismal truth that the era of American domination is over
 vah ab bhi ek mahaan desh he, lekin vah akelaa mahaan desh nahin he
 Now that we have once again given our love to them, the President still has time to win our hearts
 ve un plutocrates (paise ke bal par satta par prabhaav rakhane vaale) ko kaabo main kar sakate hai jo desh ko andhadhundh lut rahe hai, ve un adhikaron ke liye khadey ho sakate hai jinhen unhone sanvaidhanik kanoon ke professor ke rup main padhaayaa he, ve duniya main america ke khadey hone or haa, kahiraa se caracas tak apane siddhanton ke liye phir se tarif hasil karte hue uski takat main vruddhi kar sakate hai
 They can lead a new agreement on global warming by tackling the oil companies and the mobilizers for them and move it through Congress because the way the sandy storm has wreaked havoc in my neighborhood is extremely This mercilessly shows that our existence depends entirely on it
 obama phir se raashtrapati chunaav main khadey nahin ho paaenge, isliye ve ab nirbhik hone kaa jokhim mol le sakate hai, usee tarah se jaise ki unke vichaar hai
 If this happens, they will again make a place in our hearts, we will be able to make such a change that we can trust

 mahila naksaliyon ke yon shoshan ke baad maovadiyon kaa ek or krur cheharaa saamne aayaa he
 Maoists are giving training in bomb making and weaponry to innocent people who should have books in their hands
 kuch samay pehle hi yah baat saamne ai thi ki naksali jharkhand ke gramin ilaakon ke har gaanv or skool se paanch-paanch bacchon kii maang kar rahe hai
 However, the police investigation confirms that the Maoists, who are struggling with shortage of workers, are now training children in the age group of 10 to 16 years to kidnap them and use them
 ghor naksalgrast latehar main ab iskaa pramaan bhi saamne aa gaya he
 In fact, on Tuesday, a 10-year-old child undergoing training in the use of explosives at a Maoist camp died due to the blast
 police ke mutabik mangalvaar ko blast main maaraa gaya paradesi lohara un saat-aath bacchon main se ek tha, jinhen kuch din pehle sipiai (maovadi) ke kaaryakarta latehar ke herhanj thana ke bandua gaanv se uthaakar laae the
 The remaining children are still in the possession of the Maoists
 pulisia report ke mutabik naksali latehar ke herganj thana kshetra se aath bacchon ko saath le gaye the
 One of these children died while taking training in the use of explosives in the Maoist camp
 das saal kaa ye ladkaa paradeshi lohara tha jo banduaa gaanv kaa rahane vaala tha
 After the death of Lohra, his body was handed over to his family by the Naxalites on Wednesday
 naksaliyon ke nirdesh ke mutabik parijanon ne bhi chupchaap bachche ko dafna diya
 Meanwhile, someone informed the police and the police reached the village
 jiske baad police ne shav ko kabr se nikaal kar postmortem ke liye bheja
 According to Latehar SP Michael S
 Raj, seven children are still in the possession of Naxalites
 gauratlab he ki kendriya grih mantralay ne bhi apni report main kaha tha kii naksali apni ghatati takat se pareshaan hai
 Naxalites plan to add children from rural areas to the organization
 vaise bacchon ko sanghathan main jodne kii ye koi nai baat nahin he
 Even before this, five children were raised from Lohardaga
 bataaya jaataa he kii chatra jile main bhi naksaliyon ne parchaa chipka kar ye farmaan jari kiya tha ki skool ke 30 bachche sanghathan ko die jaaen
 The reality is that the Naxalites are worried about the safety of the villagers, the arrest of Naxalite leaders and the disillusionment of the villagers with Maoism and that is why the children of rural areas are targeted by them in the plan they have planned for the cadre expansion
 sharabbandi or nashile padaarthon se hone vaali haani se aam bihariyon main jagrati len ke liye 21 janvari ko puure bihar main rajya sarkaar ne ek maanav shrinkhalaa kaa aayojan kiya hai
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar issued an appeal to all parties to participate in the event

 tippaniyan Although Lalu Yadav today said that there is no uneasiness in the Grand Alliance with the Prime Minister praising liquor ban in Bihar, but Lalu Yadav alleged that if the opposition to the human chain, then the party might have been marginalized though Lalu Yadav too There have not been many vocal supporters of prohibition, but after the support of the two major parties BJP and RJD, Nitish Kumar is hopeful It will be possible that through human chain, he will succeed in the goal of showing his support to his campaign throughout the country

 After this, the question arose as to whether the 2016 IPL would be played between the six teams
 haalankibisisiine is par tatkaal tippanee karte hue kaha tha ki nauven sanskaran main bhi aath timen hi khelengi
 After the meeting in Delhi, the decision was taken on two new teams in the IPL Governing Council meeting held in Delhi on Tuesday
 jisamen pune or rajkot ke naam par muhar lagi
 Let us know that the next season of IPL will be played between 8 April to 29 May 2016
 is maamle main telugana sarkaar ne centre ko chitthee likhakar asima ko uske maalik ke changul se chhudaane kaa aagrah bhi kiya tha lekin thik teen baad hi ladki kii maut kii khabar aa gai
 Police Inspector ramesh bataate hai ki 'hamane rajya sarkaar ke pratinidhi banakar saudi arab konsewllett ko chitthee likhi thi
 We are trying to bring her body back
 ' gauratlab he ki khatun ke liye riyadh tak ke bijnes visa kaa prabandh kisi aise agent ne kiya tha jo bharat se madhya purv ke liye saste mazdoor kii supplai karata he
 Ravish, why don't you have women in your roadshow? The call of litterateur Maitreyi Pushpa disturbed me further
 usase kuch din pehle prime time kii ek darshak kaa esemes aayaa ki auraten kyon nahin bol rahi hai
 We and our colleague Sarvapriya Sangwan were worried about this from the very first day of the road show
 saharanpur ke ek gaanv main maine sarvapriya se kaha ki aap gharon ke bheetar jaaie or auraton se baat kiijie
 Then we will talk about them separately on camera
 tabhi us gaanv se shamaa or firdaus naam kii do ladkiyaan mujhe mardon kii bheed se nikaal kar le aati hai or apni vyathaa katha kehane lagati hai
 Then the story that is made after that starts to look completely different from the story of the masculine language that was being formed till a few minutes ago
 duniya bhar main faile enditivi ke darshak shamaa or firdaus kii madad ke liye baichaiyn ho jate hai
 But after this, gradually women start disappearing from our story
 hamaare satark darshak notice karne lagate hai
 There are repeated demands why women are not speaking
 ham bhi sochane lage ki kyon nahin bol rahi hai auraten
 Whenever Mohammed Mursalin's camera moves towards a frame, the women or girls standing on the threshold retreat
 mujhe mardon yaa ladakon se kahana padataa he ki aap hamaare saath mat aaie, auraton se baat kerani hai
 They do not believe
 peeche-peeche chale aate hai
 It happens that suddenly a woman looking through the window is surrounded by men from all over the village
 bolo-bolo
 
 
 Reporters have come, reporting the election
 
 
 bayaan do ki kise vot dogi
 Men are also encouraged to speak and they also start speaking
 auraten or ladkiyaan sankoch karne lagati hai
 She speaks something to speak
 nishchit rup se yah unki swaabhaavik abhivyakti nahin he
 We thought that a strategy would have to be made for this now
 ham jaise hi kisi gaanv main ghuste hai, ladakon yaa mardon se ghir jate hai
 Many of these people are ordinary people, but clever workers of many political parties, who start telling their party in disguise of common man
 jor-jor se bolne lagate hai ki hamaare netaa kii lahar he
 Common people are scared and their reaction is not natural
 hamen ek bheed se nikalakar duusari bheed banani padati he
 Have to say that you stop here, we have to talk to new people
 nae logon ke saath bhi kuch der tak swaabhaavik baatcheet hoti he, magar vahaan bhi mardon kaa kabza bana rahata he
 We then change our strategy
 ab ham kisi gaanv main bina bataae pahunchane lagate hai
 Still, there is no solution to the problem of talking to women
 mard aakhir mard nikalate hai
 They all know
 gaanv main ghuste hi pehla sawaal karte hai ki survey karne aae hai yaa bayaan lene
 The language of the statement is the same as that of newspapers and TV
 jaise hi ham zid karne lagate hai ki aap log jaaie hamen ladakiyon se baat kerani he
 Instead of leaving, they surround the women with cameras
 kitna ajeeb he
 Fifty percent of the population has no voice
 us tak pahunchane ke liye itnaa sangharsh
 This shows that the men, only the men and women of the village, the square intersections and the paths of the towns are intact
 vahi ghoomte milte hai
 This time we reach Hamidia Girls College in Allahabad
 principal se ham guzarish karte hai ki hamen ladakiyon se baat kerani he or jab ham unase baat karenge, tab aap bhi vahaan nahin hongi
 She agrees, but says that the examination is going on
 phir bhi wo gharon se kuch ladakiyon ko bula detii hai
 We arrive with the girls in a class room on the second floor of the college
 jaise hi camera recording chaalu karata he, hamaari nazar ladakiyon ke ghere ke peeche baithi professor par padati he
 i also ask them to leave the room
 unke jane ke baad bhi ladakiyon kii ghabrahat kam nahin hoti he
 Some girls were seen trying to hide behind each other
 maine unhen saamaanya hone main kaaphi vakt diya, kaaphi der ke baad ve khulne lageen
 She started talking about her dreams, difficulties and neighborhoods
 tivi or twitor dekhakar lagata he ki bharat kaa loktantr kitna badbola he, jabaki hakeekat main aisa nahin hai
 Where is the space to speak to fifty percent of the population, where is the place? Hamidia College was formed to change the fate of girls
 us college ne hamen ek baar phir ladakiyon tak pahunchane ke liye nayaa rasta dikhaa diya
 In this process we have noted a special thing
 shakya samaaj kii raajnneetik chetana par report banane ke liye mainpuri gaanv gaye the
 There we saw that women belonging to Scheduled Castes are quite vocal
 khaskar jatav samaaj kii
 Their political preference was quite clear, but the women of the Shakya who came into the backward society have not yet become as vocal
 un tak pahunchane ke liye hamen mardon kii bheed ko daantkar bhagaani padati he
 Have to ask to go away
 main mike lekar phoos kii jhopadi main khadi shashi devi naam kii mahila se baat karne ke liye pahunchataa hum
 This time Mohammad Mursalin deliberately keeps the camera far away from women
 baatcheet shuru hoti he
 Our colleague Sarvapriya Sangwan comes to the hut to help her
 auraton kaa hausala badhata he
 Slowly it starts opening
 unki baatcheet se pataa chalata he ki ve apane matdaan kaa faisla pradhan yaa pati ke kehane par karti hai
 How Pradhan deals with his vote is not known
 unhen apane rajanetaaon se ghar ke aage eent kii sadak ke alaava koi or ummid nahin hai
 The political participation of caste societies in democracy changes the political expression of the men and women of that society
 iske liye jatigat chetana bahut zaruri he
 It is the caste consciousness that builds confidence, which makes democracy diverse
 is baat ke baavjood ki jatigat chetana loktantric chetana ko aage chalakar jad kar detii he
 Gradually, women start getting a place in 'ravish Ka Roadshow'
 ham jin gaanvon main jate hai, vahaan aisi kai mahilaon se mulaakaat hoti he, jinhone road sho dekha hota he
 We found that his confidence had changed
 azamgarh ke ek gaanv main mahila ek bachche ko bhejkar hamaari team ko mardon kii toli se bula leti he
 Sit inside and share her troubles with her daughter
 ham isi zile main raahat naam kii ek radio jocky se milte hai, jo wais of azamgarh naam se saamudayik radio chalaati hai
 Rahat has come from Banaras to Azamgarh job
 yah uskaa pehla palaayan he
 One occasion changed her life, so now she wants to be the voice of those women of Azamgarh, whose husbands have migrated to Arab countries in search of work
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki zaraa si koshish karne par ham auraton kii awaz sunne lagate hai
 Their perspective starts coming
 ham 'raveesh kaa road sho' main lagaataar is baat ko kehane lagate hai ki ham jahaan bhi jate hai, mardon se ghir jate hai
 The entire public opinion becomes masculine
 janaana janamat to darj hi nahin ho rahaa he
 Their aspirations, their grievances, their restlessness all but disappeared
 aadhi aabaadi se baat kiye bagaiyr road sho kaise mukammal ho saktaa he
 This time you audience have made it complete
 mujhe pataa he ki enditivi india dekhne waalon main auraton or ladakiyon kii sankhya zyada he
 When one of his sms and phones can change my road show so much, then one of his talk can be how diverse our democracy is
 mere kaanon main abhi bhi maitreyi puspa kii awaz gunj rahi he, "raveesh tumhaare sho main striyaan kyon nahin hai
 
 
 "thank you audience

 unke parijanon ne mayawati par kanshiram or unki maa ko aapas main nahin milane dene kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 Challenging BSP supremo Mayawati to win the general election, Kanshi Ram's family questioned why Mayawati never contested any election after Kanshi Ram's death
 bahujan samaaj party chaahe centre main apane sahyog se tisare morche kii sarkaar banane kaa daawa kar rahi he, lekin is daawey ko party ke sansthaapak ke parivaar ne katghare main khadaa kar diya he

 aapako wo sadabahaar geet to yaad hi hoga jisamen, pehle ankhon hi ankhon main ishaara hota tha or baithe-baithe jeene kaa sahaara hota tha
 But now the police of Yogi ji in UP just look at their eyes and tell them whose eyes are cheating and whose eyes are bowing or getting up in shame
 bas yun samajhie kii upi police kii ankhen achaanak parkhi bhi ho gai hai or tej bhi
 That is why those eyes have claimed that they will recognize those eyes, eyes only in the eyes that roam for roadside Romeo or Majnu
 yani upi main ab naina thagenge nahin balki naina dhar lenge
 One eyes and so much skill, but where is this skill in every eye? ankhon main ye adaa ye kaza to upar vaala bas kuch chuninda ankhon ko hi detaa he
 Ask for shelter from those who have these eyes
 kyonki ye ankhen ankhon main ankhen daalkar raaj jaan leti hai
 This skill of the eyes has come down in the eyes of the SHO of UP
 behad parkhi, itani kii ye ankhen dekhakar bataa detii hai ki ankhen khandaani hai yaa sadak chhap
 These eyes will do or do pain
 pataa nahin itane barason se kahaan chuphi huin thi ye talented ankhen
 i wish that had it been found earlier, the thief could never have stolen it in UP
 lafanga ladkiyaan na chedhta
 Killer could not bleed
 bas yun samajhie ki upi main ram rajya jo ab aayaa, wo bahut pehle aa jaataa
 But do not know where these eyes were hidden
 khayr ab mil gai hai to upar vaale kaa shukr adaa kiijie
 What do you mean by eating kernels? upi ke in pulisavaalon ne kah diya ki wo ankhon se romeo ko pahchaan lete hai to bas baat khatm ho gai
 Why do you have to be surprised? experions bhi to koi chiz hoti he ki nahin or hamane to kai logon ko kehete suna he ki upi ke pulisavaalon kii ankhen, ankhen nahin balki eks-re mashin hai
 It is difficult to avoid the eyes of the UP police
 It is true that looking at the eyes, now it can be estimated that who is Ram and who is Romeo
 magar aap agar baar-baar ye puuchhenge ki upi kii police agar itani hi kaabil thi to phir upi itnaa badnaam kyon he
 It may take some time to catch the thieves and criminals, but the UP Police has the expertise in catching the criminals
 tabhi to ek-dedh hafte main hi ankhon se pahchaan karke pulisavaalon ne manchalon kii birdari main khauf paidaa kar diya he
 As soon as Yogi Adityanath becomes the head of the province, the campaign to tighten the mind is being implemented in a strong way
 dedh hazaar manchalon ko sikhaaya sabakskool se lekar college tak, bazaar se lekar koching tak, police apni parkhi nazaron se manchalon kaa scru tite kar rahi he
 Neither any evidence is needed nor any witness is needed, because they will just look at you and tell you that there was an error in your eyes
 upi pulicene apni jasusi ankhon se na sirf un budtameez ankhon ko pahchaan liya he, balki kareeb dedh hazaar se zyaada buree najar vaale aawaara aashiquon ko sabak bhi sikhaaya he
 But still, if you did not understand how the UP police won this eye-to-eye battle, then come with us, we will tell you how Naina is being arrested in UP
 road said romeo ab saavdhaan ho jaodarasal nizaam badalane ke saath-saath police ke badale tewaron se saaf jaahir he ki manachale bhale kitna bhesh badal len, magar police kii parkhi nazaron se bachane kaa vaham na paalen or na hi raham kii ummid karen
 Because now the road side Romeo in UP is difficult
 soobe kii rajdhani se lekar har chote bade shahar tak police kii jasusi ankhen mustaid hai
 But there will be something in these detective eyes of UP police that at a glance, they detect road side Romeos
 ab wo koun sa hunar he ye unheen kii jubaan main sunanaa behatar hoga
 Outside every school-college, these connoisseurs of the police are ready
 police kaa formula thodaa anokhaais mugalate main katai mat rahiega ki romeo ko pahchaanane main ye chook jaaenge, kyonki inkaa formula thodaa anokhaa he
 In the places where the road raids used to be ruled before, the anti-romeo squad in plain uniform is joining them in their group
 romeo ke thikaane ho yaa unki pahchaan upi police ne apane hi tareeke nikaal rakhe hai
 With the way of smoking cigarettes and wearing clothes, now the police is getting a sense of who is a crook
 to jaraa sanbhal ke rahiye janaab, hansiye bhi to puure adab ke saath
 Because the identity of the policemen laughed
 haavbhaav or style kii bhi he
 Romeo now change the state, it can only be explained that the road-side Romeo can either change the movement or change the state, because at the moment any such action can be very expensive
 upi main gali-gali main hai tamaam tarah ke romeo or jitne tip ke romeo hai, police ke paas unhen pahchaanane ke utane hi formule hai
 It is possible that if a person who is acting inappropriately with a girl is a policeman or the boy who is standing next to him is being teased
 kyonki soobe kii anti romeo sqoid puri tarah se ection main he
 Confuse it is right to stop those who molest girls in UP police school or college, but it is definitely a difficult task to decide who is teasing the girl and who is meeting her at the will of the girl
 yaa phir koun kisi kaam se kisi girls skool yaa phir college ke saamne se guzar rahaa he
 This is just the edge of the sword on which the UP Police is operating these days
 ladakiyon se chhedchhad karne vaale manchalon par lagaam kasne kii is koshish main police un logon ko bhi nahin baksh rahi he jo marzi se saath gum rahe hai
 To be fair, the police is actually confused, so apart from the molesting boys, the police is stopping every couple
 philhal to is oparation ke zarie road said romeo ko bina kisi sakht karrwai ke choti-moti sazaa dekar choda ja rahaa he
 But instructions have been given that if you are seen doing love in the parks from then onwards it will be very difficult

 a very painful news came out of Salarpur village in Noida on Monday morning
 subah saadhe das baje kisi ne phone karke police ko bataaya ki salarpur gaanv main ek skool kii divaar gir gai he, or uske neeche kai bachche dab gaye hai
 Two children have died in the accident
 khabar milte hi maukey par police, fire or noida ke shiksha vibhaag ke bade adhikari or dm pahunch gaye
 By that time, the people of the village were engaged in removing the children buried under the rubble, and these people had also taken out some children
 prashasan kii madad se malbe main dabe bacchon ko baahar nikaalkar aspataal pahunchaaya gaya, lekin tab tak do bacchon kii saansen tham chuki thi
 According to the police, three children had serious injuries, the remaining children had minor injuries, after which when the police started the investigation, it was found that KM Public School was running without any recognition
 skool pahunche basic shiksha adhikari balmunkud ne bataaya ki kareeb saal bhar pehle is skool kii manyata radd kar di gai thi, yani kii sarkari kaagajon main ye skool band ho chukaa tha, phir bhi ye skool chal rahaa tha, or somvaar ke din chote bacchon kaa pariksha kaa din tha
 So they were lined up along the wall

 But the word feudal cannot be used as strongly in condemning today's dynastic democracy of India
 apane samay ke thodaa paas aakar baat karen to akasar yah kaha jaataa tha ki bhartiya vanshavaad ne yah dikhaaya he ki yahaan loktantr ab bhi usee li main fansaa hua he jisane 300 saal pehle british raajnneeti ko baadhit kar rakhaa tha
 The era when constituencies were so small, so small that each voter could be bribed privately
 meraa maananaa he ki bhartiya loktantric vanshavaad is vajah se palaa-badha he kyonki yah maujuuda paristhitiyon ke anukool he
 They are modern political hybrids or hybrids
 is baat main koi andeh nahin he ki bharat main vanshavaad bharpoor he
 The most obvious example is the nehru-gandhi dynasty which dominated the Congress party
 aam taur par is baat kaa shrey indira gandhi ko diya jaataa he ki unhone congress ko ek paariwarik kaarobaar main tabdeel kar diya, lekin haal main prakashit apni aatmakatha main kuldeep naiyar kehete hai ki laal bahadur shastri kaa yah maananaa tha ki nehru kii vanshavaadi aakankshaayen thim, ve apni beti ko apana uttaradhikari bananaa chaahate the

 Before criticizing India's dynastic politics in blasphemous terms like feudal or backward, it should be kept in mind that dynasty is widespread throughout Asia

 One of the many questions about Pakistan is whether Bilawal, the son of Benazir Bhutto, will be able to defend the dynasty established by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto
 yahaan tak ki china main bhi party ke bade netaaon ke bete or betiyon ko unke prabhaav ko dekhte hue 'red princej' kaha jaataa he
 America with Roosevelt, Kennedy and of course the Bush family cannot ridicule Indian dynasty

 He said dynasty is equally effective in the modern political system because it attracts people on the basis of "inherited charisma that helps legitimize the succession of leadership and minimize organizational divisions
" Can
 ''bharat main vansh parampara se aae logon kaa partiyon par kabja rahaa he
 i remember when i suggested to a senior Congress leader that when Rajiv Gandhi's fate was in its worst phase, the party should have troubled him
 yah sunakar congress netaa stabdh se dikh rahe the
 He said, "the nehru-gandhi family is the main pillar of the party
" unhen baahar kar dene se party hi dhah jaaegi
 After this, many incidents justified his point
 ayodhya andolan ke baad party dhahne ke kagaar par pahunch gai thi, lekin party netaa arjuna singh ne pradhanmantri pi
 V
 narsingh raav ke khilaaf apana abhiyaan shuru kar diya
 Let me tell you, Sonia Gandhi, the sequel of the dynasty, apparently looking reluctant, was instrumental in blinding the power of Narasimha Rao from behind the scenes
 koun jaanata he ki yadi achaanak sonia gandhi bich main nahin ai hotin or paariwarik party par niyantran hasil nahin kiya hota to congress aaj kahaan hoti?bhartiya netaaon ko anushaasan main rahane ke liye ek kaddavar netaa kii jarurat hoti he
 There will be many such leaders in the BJP who, thinking the crisis of their leaderless party, will think that they wish! Atal Bihari Vajpayee would have been a descendant
 congress ko dikkat ho rahi he kyonki indira gandhi ne yah niyam bana diya he ki kisi bhi congressi netaa ko kshetreey vanshavaad chalaane kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi, taaki koi karunanidhi jaisi chunauti de sakane ke liye paryaapt taqatvar na ho jaae
 Not being the leader of the regional dynasty in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections this year, the Congress had to rely solely on Rahul Gandhi's charisma to fight two very strong dynastic leaders Mulayam and Mayawati
 mayawati ko bhi vanshavaadi parampara kaa netaa is vajah se mana ja saktaa he ki unki party ke sansthaapak kanshiram ne unhen vasiyat main netritv diya tha
 Does Rahul Gandhi's failure to perform a miracle in Uttar Pradesh mean that he has no magic, no dynastic charisma? But the crowd that gathered to see them conveys the opposite
 lekin chunaav jeetne ke liye hameshaa nehru-gandhi khandaan ke karishme par nirbhar rahane vaale aalsee congressi netaa yah bhul gaye ki sirf karishma hi vot dilaane ke liye kaaphi nahin hota or bheed se matadaataaon ke ruzan kaa bharosemand sankawt hasil nahin kiya ja saktaa
 During the 1991 election campaign from Jhansi to Kanpur with Rajiv Gandhi, i saw a large, enthusiastic crowd surround him and i kept falling down several times in Dhakkamukhi
 main yah maanane laga tha ki chunaav unki jheli main he
 But the results demonstrated that if the tragic incident of his assassination had not taken place, the Congress could not have formed the next government and even after sympathy votes could not get an absolute majority
 zyaadaatar kshetreey vansh parampara ke netaaon ko jati jodatii he or congress tathaa bijepi donon apane jaateey ganit ke hisaab se kaam karti hai
 Although it is criticized all over the world, dynastic democracy has brought such a revolution in the castes, which has traditionally empowered people without power
 lekin pashchim ke ekal pariwaron se kaaphi alag bharat kii majboot paariwarik parampara hi votaron kii najar main vanshavaad ko jaij tehraati he
 In India, it is considered quite natural and acceptable that a father and mother having any kind of authority hand over it to their son or daughter
 inder malhotra ne ise bahut acchhee tarah se bataaya he
 In his book Dynasties of Injia and Beyond, he says, "the outspoken minority condemnation of dynasties is particularly sharp in India and its main goal is the nehru-gandhi family
" lekin isaki vastav main shant bahusankhyak janata kii chuppi se koi tulana nahin he
 The major part of the population of the subcontinent does not consider anything objectionable in giving inheritance of political power from parents to children
 ''inder is chup rahane vaale bahumat ko 'saamaajik rup se kund' bataate hai

 isaki jagah main vanshavaad ko bharat main maujuuda samay kii jaruraton ko puraa karne vaala maanata hum, jo kuch had tak sthirataa pradaan karte hue loktantr ko bachaae hue he
 Talking about the future, i hope that the importance of dynasty will be less, but this does not mean that India should blindly adopt Western democracy
 aakhirkaar loktantr ke bare main sabase zyada shor machaane vaale america ko dhanik tantra hi kaha ja saktaa he, or aisa isliye he kyonki vahaan raajnneeti main bada khilaadi banane ke liye bahut zyada dhan kii jarurat hoti he
