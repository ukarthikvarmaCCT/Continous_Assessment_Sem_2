 mere pita or meraa aparaadh agar yah he ki udyogon ko jameen kodiyon ke bhav di gai to gujarat or tamilnadu sarkaron ko to is aadhaar par barkhaast kar dena chahie, jinhone kaarkaane lagane ke liye udyog jagat ko muft main jaminen di hai
 What will be done on the land deals of the previous governments of the state? What n
 chandrababu naidu ke shashan ke dauraan hue jameenon ke aavanton kii jaanch kii jaaegi? jahaan tak sakshi (jagan ke media house) ke valuation kii baat he, jo bhi dhan aayaa he, yah sabit karne ke liye dastavej hai ki vah kahaan se aayaa
 Is there anything else said in the investigation? i am not worried about the investigation
 maine vakeelon kii sevaayen lee hai jo ise dekhenge
 But think how the image of the state is being discounted
 mujhe khatm karne kii badale kii karrwai main congress andhra pradesh se kaarobaar ko khatm kar rahi he
 What do you have to say, the Congress is acting with a sense of revenge? The Congress is very retaliatory
 yah ajeeb party he, jis par kuch logon kaa asar rahata he
 The Congress and Sonia Gandhi have taken it personally and are not accepting the fact that even a child can stand on their own feet
 ve sochate hai ki main congress ke bagaiyr jinda nahin rah saktaa
 They have forgotten that it is democracy and not emergency or rule of some people
 aap par jameen dene, galat record or jaalsaji ke badale udyogpatiyon se anuchit laabh uthaane kaa aarope he
 Who is making this charge? Congress
 iskaa kya matlab nikalataa he? main jaanch main sahyog kar rahaa hum, sibiai ke sawaalon ke jawaab die hai
 Let us see what 'truth' comes out of it
 odarpu yatra ab bhi jari rahegi?main ise tab tak khatm nahin karuunga jab tak apane pita ke liye jaan dene vaale har vyakti ke parivaar se nahin mil letaa
 i have learned a lot during this journey
 maine garib se garib jilon main 700 gharon kaa daura kiya he
 People tell me how my father's plans have impacted his life
 main yah sab dekhakar fakhr mahasoos karata hum
 You have become a respected leader in a very short time, what will you say? Ten years ago i did not want to enter politics
 rahul gandhi jab raajnneeti main aae to ise lekar logon main kaaphi utsaah tha
 Then my family thought that i should also get into politics
 lekin main ek media company chalaanaa chahta tha
 In 2009, my father asked me to enter politics
 maine unase kaha ki main raajnneeti kii dhul or gandagi main kyon jaaun jabaki ek media samooh kaa maalik hone se rajaneta khud mere paas aate hai
 i never thought that one day i would have to handle these things without my father
 lekin aage badhate hue main sikh rahaa hum
 It is a very lesson lesson experience
 rahul gandhi ke bare main kya kahenge?main unke bare main kuch nahin kahana chahta
 If i say anything about them, it would seem quite arrogant
 25 may ko kolkata main tha ipel kaa final
 a day before that, all the top BCCI officials had reached here
 atakalein thim ki bisisiai ke mukhiya en shrinivasana istipha de denge
 But that evening, at the dinner of Jagmohan Dalmiya, the Chief of Bengal Cricket Association and the oldest rice of this hand, something happened that all the tricks were reversed
 jin arun jetali or rajeev shukla ko shrinivasana ko istife dene ke liye raji karaane kii jimmedaari di gai thi
 He got trapped in the vortex
 shrinivasana ne kaha ki agar meri naitik jimmedaari banati he, to aap donon kii bhi
 If you resign, everyone will give
 itnaa hi nahin shrinivasana ne to nae sire se chunaav karaane kii baat bhi kah di
 After this, the wind trend reversed
 is bich kuch sadasyon ne daalamia se bhi baghawat kii sadaarat karne ko kaha
 But he has decided to stay behind the scenes in this Mahabharata, citing health deterioration
 is meeting ke baad hi nae sire se aashwast shrinivasana ne press conference main kaha, ki main kisi ko jabaran meraa pad chhinane nahin duungaa
 What happened was Dalmia's dinner, in which the top officers of the board and 27 members were invited to this dinner at a five-star hotel in Kolkata
 magar bijepi ke yuva morcha adhyaksh anuraag thakur jaise kai sakriy sadsy isse dur rahe
 By then, the name of BJP leader and Arun Jaitley, who represented Delhi on the board, had started running as the next president
 kanoon par unki pakad or rajyasksha main vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par jutai pratishtha kii puunji ke sahare musiibat se paar lagane kaa plan banane laga tha
 But the allegations of corruption on Jaitley League people and the party's stand on it were not openly exposed
 board ke pichley mukhiya shashaank manohar kaa naam bhi kuch vakt ke liye chalaa tha
 But the argument came that for the last two years he was away from the board and cricket
 aise main yah dur kii kaudi laga
 However, a total of 17 state unit members reached the dinner
 shuruaati baatcheet main sabane saaf kar diya ki na to cricket or na hi sanstha ke hit main hai maujuuda ghatnakram or uske chalate lage aarope
 The indications were clear from everyone that Srinivasan should resign, taking moral responsibility
 magar sawaal ye khadaa hua ki bilaute ke gale main ghanti koun baandhe
 Here began a search for leadership to protest
 ye pahunchi ipel chairman, kendriya mantri rajeev shukla or bijepi netaa arun jetali tak
 Jaitley is a member of the Governing Council of the IPL
 donon ne bahes ko paravaan chadhaaya or shrinivasana ko samajhaayaa ki unke istipha dene se chijen durust hi hongi
 Kije Srinivasan then said, "okay, i step down
" magar naitik jimmedaari to aap donon kii bhi banati he
 So both of you will also have to resign
 sutron ke mutabik aavesh main aae shrinivasana yahaan tak bol gaye ki agar itani hi safai or saaf chhavi kii baat kii ja rahi he, to kyon na samuhik istipha ho or phir nae sire se chunaav
 On hearing this, most of the members of the board came into the can
 netaa nahin mila, to ruk gai baghawatatamam virodh ke baad bhi shrinivasana philhal bache hue hai, to isaki vajah netaaon se bhare board main baghawat ke liye netritv kaa abhaav bhi he
 If Srinivasan did not resign, then according to the constitution of the board, another option was to remove him
 iske liye 10 board members ko dastakhat kar ye arji deni thi ki maujuuda halaat ke maddenjar board kii argent meeting bulaai jaae
 Its agenda was also to be clear that the purpose of this meeting is to remove the board president
 meeting main agar do tihaai sadsy ise manjuuri de dete, to shrinivasana kii rukhsati tay thi
 But the question was stuck there again
 ve 10 vir koun honge
 Nobody wanted to be bad
 sabake apane apane ranneetik or aarthik ganit jo the
 Jaitley and Shukla Maan looked forward to Manowal, but they did not agree to adopt this method
 is ranneeti main sabase badi khami vaikalpik netritv kaa abhaav bhi thi
 It was believed that former cricketer Shivlal Yadav would take over the command after Srinivasan left
 magar maujuuda haalat main unki tajposhi ko sahi daanv nahin mana gaya
 Only after that it was decided to wait for the moment and the board at least looked externally united
 bisisiai sachiv ajay shirke ne lodha samiti ke patron kaa jawaab dete hue kaha he ki bhartiya cricket kii sanchaalan sanstha rajya ikaayiyon ko apane chunaav karaane se nahin roak sakati
 Elections of the Bengal Cricket Association (CAB) and Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) could not be held on the scheduled date as a panel appointed by the Supreme Court sent a letter to the BCCI to inform the unions that elections to all state units should be stopped

 Shirke has said in his reply that the BCCI cannot stop the unions from holding elections but nobody asked the BCCI to stop the unions from holding elections

 His niece was supervising him

 raajnneeti main zyaadaatar faislekhud ke phaayde ke liye hote hai
 But there are also some decisions whose scope of benefits becomes wider - and all parties with a common interest become part of the list of beneficiaries
 ye to saaf he kibihar ke mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhike sabhi faisle nitish kumaar ko nuksaan pahunchane vaale hai
 But what is the benefit only limited to Manjhi or his supporters mlas and Ministers? Talking about Manjhi's latest decision
 paswan jati ko mahadalit main shaamil kiye jane kii
 With this decision, no caste is now in Dalit in Bihar, but all have become Mahadalit
 ab paswan jati ko bhi tamaam sarkari skim kaa phayda milegaa
 How much will the BJP benefit? Whether the nature of the benefit is direct or indirect
 phayda to phayda hi he
 As much as Manjhi will harm JDU and Nitish, the BJP is the only beneficiary
 maanjhi lagaataar bijepi kii ore se madad kii ummid lagaae hue hai, lekin bijepi kii majaburi he ki apane savarna vot bank kii vajah se wo khule taur par maanjhi ko saport nahin kar paa rahi he
 Manjhi's attempt to include the Paswanas among the Mahadalits is to harm Nitish the most
 apane mahadalit agenda ke boote hi nitish ne bihar main nae sameekaran banaae or unke is soshal ejineering kaa loha mana jane laga
 Now whatever will come in Manjhi's bag, BJP is sure to get its benefit
 maanjhi ke kadamon se nitish kaa nuksaan hona bijepi kaa sidhaa phayda he
 Now Manjhi can become a part of the NDA by forming a separate party or joining Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party [if possible]
 bijepi to yahi chaahati he ki bihar vidhaan sabha chunaav main wo maanjhi kaa zyada se zyada phayda uthaa sake
 How much will Manjhi benefit? Manjhi's decision to include the Paswanas among the Mahadalits is Manjhi's political brahmastra
 agar maanjhi bahumat sabit nahin kar paae or chunaav main akele utarana sambhav nahin ho sakaa to endie kaa hissaa ban sakate hai or apane liye zyada se zyada siton ke liye mol bhav kar sakate hai
 Big Leader Who is Manjhi or Paswan? According to the 2011 census, Mahadalits constitute about 16% of Bihar's 10 crore and 40 lakh population
 paswanon ko shaamil kiye jane ke baad is sankhya main or ijapha ho gaya he
 During the tenure of Nitish Kumar, who formed the Mahadalit Commission in Bihar, the Paswan caste was excluded from the Mahadalit class
 ram vilaas paswan ne iskaa kaaphi virodh kiya tha
 Till date Ram Vilas Paswan has been the greatest leader of his community, but he could not get the benefit of the Mahadalits
 maanjhi ne ye kaam kar ek tir se kai nishane laga liye hai
 Manjhi has previously served in the Congress and the RJD and now the JDU has sacked him
 philhal ye teenon partiyaan haath milakar maanjhi ko kinare lagane main juty hui hai
 In such a situation, Manjhi has only hope left from BJP and Paswan
 barason tak maanjhi bas itnaa jaanate the ki wo kya kya nahin kar sakate
 After getting the chief minister's chair, he came to know what he could do
 siyasat jab satta kii chaabi detii he to akl apneaap jaati he
 Manjhi himself is taking full advantage of it, and is also benefitting the rest immensely

 The house was finally adjourned indefinitely after a 6-time adjournment due to uproar
 prashnkaal ke turant baad adhyaksh mira kumaar ne carmik rajya mantri ve narayansami se samvidhan 117waan sanshodhan vidheyak 2012 vichaar ke liye pesh karne ko kaha
 But as Narayanasamy stood up to speak, SP members came in front of the seat and started shouting slogans against the bill
 ve naare laga rahe the, 'pramotion main aarakshan nahin chalegaa nahin chalegaa
 During this time, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav also stood in his place and was protesting
 rajyasabha main bijepi ne vidheyak ke paksh main matdaan kiya tha
 But later there were some differences in the party regarding this bill
 party saansadon menka gandhi or yogi adityanath ne sansad ke baahar vidheyak ke virodh main khulkar tippaniyan kin
 Maneka claimed that no BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh is in favor of the bill
 narayansami ne guuruuvaar ko vidheyak kii prati se kuch nahin padhaa balki dharapravaah bolte chale gayi
 While presenting the bill on Wednesday, SP member Yashveer Singh snatched the bill from him
 vidheyak chhine jate samay narayansami duusari pankti main khadey the, lekin guuruuvaar ko unhone vidheyak ke bare main chhathi pankti se bolnaa shuru kiya or unke agal-bagal satta paksh ke sadsy baithe hue the
 At the time when SP members were shouting slogans in front of the posture, BJP members stood up and said that when there is no system in the house, then the constitutional amendment cannot be introduced
 bijepi sadasyon ne asana se kaha, 'aap galat parampara daal rahi hai
 It is a violation of parliamentary rules
 ’ jab hangaamaa thama nahin, to bijepi sansadeey dal ke pramukh laalkrishna adwani kuch bolne ke liye khadey hue, lekin espi sadasyon kii narebaaji jari rahi
 Amid sloganeering, the Speaker called PL Punia of Congress as the first speaker on the bill
 hangaame ke bich puniya ne apni baat kehani jari rakhi, lekin bijepi sadsy is baat se naaraazgi jataane lage ki sadan main vyavastha nahin hone par samvidhan sanshodhan jaise mahatvapurn vidheyak par charchaa chalaanaa thik nahin he
 Advani wanted to say something about this but he did not get a chance
 hangaame ke kaaran do baar ke sankshipt sthagan ke baad sadan kii baithak jab dopaher sava baje shuru hui, to espi ke saath saath bijepi sadsy bhi asana ke saamne aakar narebaaji karne lage, 'pratipaksh kaa aisa apmaan nahin chalegaa, nahin chalegaa
 'SP members kept shouting slogans against reservation in promotion
 is bich congress ke sadsy bhi agrim panktiyon main aakar ve waant aarakshan ’ ke naare lagane lage
 The BJP, which supported the bill in the Rajya Sabha, wanted time to consider the bill
 uskaa tark tha ki yah asal vidheyak nahin he kyonki isamen sanshodhan kiye gayi hai
 Seeing no uproar, the Speaker adjourned the house till 2 pm
 isse pehle jis samay sadan kii baithak sthagit thi, vigyaan praudyogiki mantri es jaipal reddi adwani or netaa pratipaksh sushamaa swaraj se baat karte dekhe gayi
 Both also spoke to Mulayam
 iske baad congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko jaakar baatcheet kii jaankaree di
 On the other hand, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath, Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal and Congress's Girija Vyas were also seen talking to Mulayam
 bijepi sadsy bhi mulaayam se aagrah karte najar aae ki ve apane sadasyon ko niyantrit karen taaki adwani apni baat rakh saken
 When Mulayam did not listen to BJP, Anant Kumar of BJP heard him saying that the next time he (mulayam) would stand to speak, he would not be allowed to speak
 dopaher do baje baithak shuru hone par espi or bijepi sadasyon kii narebaaji or hangaamaa jari rahaa or sadan kii baithak dopaher dhai baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di gai
 Even as the House met at two and a half, the SP members continued to create chaos and slogans
 udhar varisht bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani ko bolne kaa avasar nahin die jane kaa virodh karte hue bijepi sadasyon ne bhi asana ke samaksh aakar narebaaji shuru kar di
 Due to this, the meeting was postponed for a few minutes till three o'clock

 Kotwal Yadvendra Pal said on Saturday that the matter is of Kotwali area
 30 varshiya mahila kaa pati shahar se baahar rahata he
 The woman lives in a rented room on Gorakhpur Road with two young children
 usee makaan main aaropee bhi rahata he
 Yadavindra Pal told that the woman was sleeping in the room on Thursday night
 garmi adhik hone kii vajah se usne darwaja band nahin kiya tha
 At midnight, the young man entered her room and tried to rape her
 unhone kaha ki mahila virodh karte hue aaropee yuvak se bhid gayi
 Meanwhile, the young man attacked her with a knife
 bachaav ke dauraan mahila ke ek haath main chaaku lag gaya
 After this, the young man ran away

 har nadi ke paas ek kahani hoti he
 Swarnarekha is also near the river
 jharkhand kii is nadi ko vaise hi jeevandaayini kaha jaataa he jaise har ilaake main ek na ek nadi kahi jaati he
 But this river of Jharkhand, according to its name, springs true gold
 yah kissa swarnarekha ke udgam ke paas ke gaanv, nagadi ke paas ranichuan ke lokmanas main gaharaai se rachaa-basaa he ki agyatavaas ke samay pandav yahaan aakar rahe the, isiilie gaanv kaa naam pandu he
 The special thing is that the origin of Swarnarekha got its name from Rani Chua because once when Queen Draupadi got thirsty in this deserted area, Arjun shot an arrow and pulled water from the same place, which is still present
 samay ke saath nadi kaa naam swarnarekha pad gaya
 As such, myths are little outside the realm of truth or falsehood
 yah pataa nahin ki pandu gaanv, pandavon ke agyatavaas or arjuna ke baan se nirmit rani chuaan kii kahani kitni sach he? lekin yah myth katai nahin he ki swarnarekha jharkhand kii ganga kii tarah he or ganga kii tarah hi isko dekhnaa ab romaanchakaari kam or niraashajanak zyada ho gaya he
 But gold certainly comes out of the river Swarnarekha, but no one knows where the gold comes from
 swarnarekha nadi main swarnakanon ke milane ke kaaran is kshetra ke swarnakaaron ke liye is nadi kii khaas ahmiyat he
 Legend has it that when the Nagavanshi kings who ruled the region were attacked by the Mughal rulers, the Nagavanshi queen flowed her gold jewelery into the river, with the sharp edge of which the jewelery turned into goldsmiths and continues to this day
 aaj bhi aap jaaen to nadi main soup liye jagah-jagah khadi mahilaayein dikh jaaengi
 Families in about half a dozen villages in the area depend on the gold emanating from this river
 kadrudih, purananagar, nodhi, tulsidih jaise gaanvon ke log is nadi se pidhiyon se sona nikaal rahe hai
 Earlier men of these villages also used to do this work, but due to low income, men took up other work, while women do the same today to provide financial help to the family
 nadi kii ret se roj sona nikaalane vaale to dhanwaan hone chahie? par aisa he nahin
 The situation is such that the gold fillers do not even have enough money to sustain their families throughout the day
 nadi se sona chaanane vaali har mahila ek din main kareeb ek yaa do chaaval ke dane ke baraabar sona nikaal leti he
 The total gold in a month is about one to one and a half grams
 har din sthaneey sahuukaar mahila se 80 rupye main ek chaaval ke baraabar sona kharidta he
 He sells it in the market for around 300 rupees
 har mahila sona bechakar kareeb 5,000 rupye tak maheene main kamaati he
 This rainy river, 395 km long, is the smallest interstate (flowing through many states) in the country with an area of about 19 thousand sq km of the basin
 yah ranchi, sarayakela-kharasaavaan, purvi singhbhum, pashchimi medinipur (pashchim bengal) or balasore (odisha) se hokar bahati he
 But experts say that this river has started drying up now and it has become a drain at its place of origin
 jaankaron ke mutabik, is nadi main kam hote pani kii vajah se bhoojal str bhi teji se girtaa ja rahaa he
 Soil erosion has also increased due to the forests being cut
 haalanki is nadi par banane vaale chandil or ichaa baandh kaa adivaasiyon ne kadaa virodh kiya or yahaan 6 janvari, 1979 ko hui police firing main chaar adivaasiyon ne apni jaan de di
 The project went on and after the CAG report of corruption on the project in 1999, it took 40 years to complete

 There are many types of minerals in this river basin
 sone kaa zikr ham kar hi chuke hai
 But they all spoiled the appearance of the river
 khanan or dhaatu prasanskaran udyogon ne nadi ko pradooshit karnaa bhi shuru kar diya he
 Now there is presence of radioactive elements along with domestic and industrial wastes in the river water
 khaskar, khule khadaanon se bahakar aae ayask is nadi kii saans ghont rahe hai
 Mayurbhanj and Singhbhum districts of Odisha have the highest copper deposits in the country
 2016 main kiye giri va anya vaigyanikon ke ek adhyayan ke mutabik, suvarna rekha nadi main dhatvik pradooshan maujuud he
 Now illegal sand mining is on the upswing in the river and its tributaries
 isse nadi kii paristhitiki khatre main aa gai he
 There are deposits of uranium in the intermediary of this river basin
 uranium khadaanon ke liye mashhoor jaadoogoda kaa naam to aapane suna hi hoga
 According to media reports, radioactive elements are flowing into the river from the tailing pond of this mine
 jamshedpur shahar, jo is nadi ke basin kaa sabase bada shahar he, kaa sara sivej sidhe nadi main aakar girtaa he
 And now the amount of oxygen in its water is decreasing and the Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in the river water has exceeded the standard, while the Biological Oxygen Demand should be less than the standard
 jharkhand rajya pradooshan niyantran board ne swarnarekha nadi ke pani ke namoonay kii jaanch karai to pataa chalaa ki adhiktar jagahon par pani main oxigen kii maatra kam pai gai
 The situation is that the water of the Swarnarekha river is not safe for animals and fish
 jaanwaron or machhliyon ke liye pani main biological oxigen demand kii maatra 1
 Should be less than 2 mg, while 7
 0 milligram prati litre tak he
 Due to this, a large number of fish are dying in the river, as well as animals are also suffering from many diseases
 swarnarekha or kharkai nadiyon kaa sangam, jamshed poor ke thik paas main he or yahaan aap louh ayask ke kaarkaanon se nikle slog ko dekh sakate hai
 However, BJP leader (now rebel) Saryu Rai filed a public interest litigation in 2011, and Tata Steel then replied that the slug has been deposited to save the people of the city from the flood of the golden line
 hycourt ne tata ko yah jagah saaf karne ko kaha tha
 However, the action taken on this is not the latest news
 is ilaake main maujuud choti or badi audyogic ikaayiyon, louh galan bhatthiyon, kol washrij or khadaanon ne nadi kii durgati kar rakhi he
 However, from the perspective of farming, tourism and religious-spiritual center, from the origin to the mouth of the golden stream, it is less likely that myths associated with Pandavas and Nagavanshi kings of Chutia Nagpur are heard less in this area and more are heard of reality

 Below the level of the BJP, Giramayavati said that despite the defeats in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, the big leaders of the BJP seem to be forced in front of their criminal mentality and Sanghi moves
 unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi nishane par liya
 Mayawati said, 'amit Shah's statement shows to what extent the level of BJP has gone down under the leadership of Guru (narendra Modi) and Shishya (amit Shah)
 'ye tha amit shah kaa bayanbijepi ke sthapana diwas par 6 april ko mumbai main ek raily ke dauraan unhone kaha tha, '2019 (chunaav) ke liye ulti ginati shuru ho chuki he

 Only one vatavriksha survives and snakes, mongoose, dogs and cats and other animals come together to protect themselves from the rising water
 ' unhone kaha tha, 'modi baadh ke kaaran sabhi billi, kute, saanp or nevala muqabla karne saath aa rahe hai
 This statement of Amit Shah has also been condemned by the Congress and many other opposition parties

 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat has made a big statement about the Hindu nation
 mohan bhagwat ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki sangh 'bharat ek hindu raashtra' ke apane najariye par adig he
 In his address during the Sangh's Vijayadashami festival in Reshmibagh, Nagpur, Sarsanghchalak said that all Indians working for the glory and peace of the nation are "hindus"
 sangh kii apane raashtra kii pahchaan ke bare main saath hi ham sabaki samuhik pahchaan ke bare main or hamaare desh ke swabhaav kii pahchaan ke bare main spasht drushti va ghoshnaa he
 He is well-informed and determined that India is a Hindu nation
 bhagwat ne aage kaha ki jo bharat ke hai, jo bhartiya purvajon ke vanshaj hai va sabhi vividhtaon kaa sweekaar, sammaan va swaagat karte hue aapas main miljul kar desh kaa vaibhav va maanavtaa main shanti badhaane kaa kaam karne main jute jate hai ve sabhi bhartiya hindu hai
 It is worth noting that earlier Mohan Bhagwat has given a big statement about different incidents of mob lynching
 unhone kaha ki ‘bheed hatya' (linching) pashchimi tarika he or desh ko badnaam karne ke liye bharat ke sandarbh main iskaa istemaal nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Let me tell you that Mohan Bhagwat said this while addressing the volunteers after 'shastra Puja' at the Reshimbagh ground here on the occasion of Vijayadashami
 unhone kaha ki 'linching' shabd kii utpatti bhartiya lokachar se nahin hui, aise shabd ko bharatiyon par naa thopa jaae
 During this, the Sangh chief said that Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Shah should be commended for removing most of the provisions of Article 370 giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir
 yah ek saahasik kadam tha
 He said that in the last few years, there has been a change in the direction of thinking of India, which the people who do not want are in the world and also in India, and for vested interests, these powers do not want to allow India to become strong and powerful
 desh kii suraksha par sangh pramukh ne kaha ki saubhaahgya se hamaare desh ke suraksha samarthy kii sthiti, hamaare sena kii taiyaari, hamaare shashan kii suraksha niti va hamaare antarrashtriya raajnneeti main kushalta kii sthiti is prakaar kii bani he ki is maamle main ham log sajag or aashwast hai
 He said that security vigilance on our land borders and water boundaries is better than before
 keval sthal seemaper rakshak va chaukiyon kii sankhya va jal seemaper (dwipon vaale tapuon kii) nigaraanee adhik badhaani padegi
 There has also been a decrease in militant violence inside the country
 ugravadiyon ke aatmasamarpan kii sankhya bhi badi he
 Bhagwat said that different sections of the society should strive to increase goodwill, dialogue and cooperation among themselves
 samaaj ke sabhi virgon kaa sadbhaav, samarasata va sahyog va kanoon samvidhan kii maryaada main hi apane maton kii abhivyakti yah aaj kii sthiti main nitant aavashyak baat he

 It was believed that Bhagwat made this remark during a coordination meeting held behind closed doors of the Sangh and its associated organizations
 samanvay baithak ke baad sangh ke ek padaadhikari ne kaha tha ki mohan bhagwatji ne spasht kaha ki ek bhi hindu ko desh nahin chhodana hoga
 He had said that Hindus who came to India after suffering persecution and suffering in other nations will remain here

 The comments isse pehle sarkaar ke aviation ministar ne saaf kiya tha ki airport kii viipi list se wadra kaa naam hataane kaa unka koi iraadaa nahin he
 Vadra had alleged that this was an attempt to tarnish his image under the conspiracy

 Hello to all you beautiful people out there! This Monday, i want to talk to you about miracles
 At @thedivayoga and @sarvayogastudios, we truly do believe in miracles
 But miracles don't happen overnight, they take time, they take effort and they need for us to be open, but they are not impossible
 Speaking of miracles, here is a variation of the Chamatkarasana, which helps us do just this! It truly is a miracle asana, which helps in both physical and psychological benefits
 1
 It meticulously combines the back bend and single hand balance
 2
 Physically, it opens the chest, shoulders and throat
 3
 Opens the hips and hip flexors
 4
 Stretches and strengthens the back
 5
 It cultivates feelings of universal love and acceptance
 Here's my gratitude message for you today, "may all beings everywhere be happy and free, and may the thoughts, words, and actions of my own life contribute in some way to that happiness and to that freedom for all
 "hello Universe, Hello new week! @sarvesh_shashia post shared bymalaika Arora (@malaikaaroraofficial) onsep 15, 2019 at 11:21 pm pdtview this post on instagramas James Broughton said, "i'm happy to report, the child in me is still ageless" Started learning advance yoga at 42
 
 
 rather late, but better late than never
 i always wanted to do the # vrischikasana
 i believe it’s never too late to learn something new
 Years may wrinkle the skin (that I'm okay with), but to give up enthusiasm will wrinkle my soul
 
 
 that i couldn’t live with
 We don't grow old with the number of years we live, we age when we stop living
 
 
 So Live it up # instafam
 Never give up
 Try something new

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke khilaaf kathith aapattijanak post ko lekar swatantra patrkaar prashanth kanaujia kii giraftaar ko unki patni jagisha aroda ne chunauti di he
 The matter will be heard on Tuesday
 prashanth kii patni jagisha kanaujia ne supreme court main 'habiyas corpus' yachika daakhil kii he
 The petition said that Prashant's arrest is illegal and the UP police has neither given information about the FIR in this regard nor followed any guidelines for the arrest
 unhen dilli main transit remand ke liye kisi magistrate ke paas bhi pesh nahin kiya gaya
 Along with this, it has been argued that in the FIR, Section 500 of the IPC has been imposed, which the police cannot impose, this magistrate can only apply
 do dharaaen jamaanti hai
 Let us tell you that he was detained by Uttar Pradesh Police in Delhi on Saturday morning from his house in Mandavali
 police ne shanivaar ko bataaya ki patrkaar prashanth kanaujia ke khilaaf hajratganj thane main shuukravaar raat main ek sab inspector dwaara prathimaki darj kii gai
 It alleged that the accused made "objectionable" remarks against the Chief Minister and tried to tarnish his image
 pitiai-bhashaa dwaara sampark kiye jane par police ke ek varisht adhikari ne shuru main kaha ki patrkaar ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 However, the officer later clarified that no arrests had been made yet
 adhikari ne bataaya ki police patrkaar se poochtacha karne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Kanaujia shared a video on Twitter and Facebook, in which a woman is seen talking to reporters of various media organizations outside the Chief Minister's office
 mahila daawa kar rahi he ki usne mukhyamantri ko vivaah kaa prastaav bheja he
 On Twitter Handel of Kanaujia has written that he has been a student of IIMC and University of Mumbai and is associated with some media organizations
 supreme court ne sahaara samooh ke pramukh subrat roy sahaara ko saaf-saaf chetavanee di he ki agar unhone 6 farvari kii tay taarikh tak 600 karod rupee kaa bhugtan nahin kiya to unhen waapas jail bhej diya jayega
 The court has stated clearly that Sahara Group will have to deposit Rs 600 crore by February 6, 2017, if Subrata Roy does not deposit the money till deadline, then Subrata Roy will have to go to jail
 subrat roy ko 600 karod rupee jamaa karne ke liye chah farvari kaa samay diya gaya tha
 The Supreme Court gave this ruling after hearing the Sahara Group's petition in the SEBI dispute
 pichley saptaah sahaara samooh kii taraf se nai arji daakhil kar jald sunwaayee kii darkhwaast kii gai thi, jisecourtne manjuur karte hue aaj kii taarikh di thi
 In fact, the Sahara Group had filed a petition in the court demanding that it be given more time to deposit the money, because there are problems in raising money due to demonetisation
 haalanki khabaron kii maane to court ne sahaara kii is tarah kii koi daleel maanane se inkaar kar diya he
 Significantly, on November 28, 2016, the Supreme Court directed Sahara chief Subrata Roy to deposit Rs 600 crore by February 6, 2017 to stay out of jail
 isse pehle 25 oktober ko supreme court ne subrat roy caparolko 28 november tak ke liye badha diya tha, tab sahaara kii ore se sebi ke paas 200 karod rupee jamaa karaae the
 Subrata Roy, after spending almost 2 years in Tihar jail, came out in May 2016 when his mother died
 uske baad main unka parole is shart par badhaayaa gaya ki vah niveshkon kaa paisa lautaane ke liye samay-samay par sebi ke paas rakam jamaa karaate rahenge
 a youth arrested for allegedly traveling without a ticket in West Bengal's Virbhum district on Thursday was taken into custody by the police

 The comments police ne bataaya ki veerbhum jile ke nanoor main rahane vaale shaikh yaccin ko dopaher hiraasat main le liya gaya
 He was caught in a bus for traveling without tickets

 Thackeray said, 'even if the local BJP leaders continue to discuss the mid-term elections, they should do it once
 ho saktaa he ki ve is mudde par apane party adhyaksh ke rukh ke bare main nahin jaanate hon
 Thackeray said, "if the Chief Minister (devendra Fadnavis) says that if Shiv Sena withdraws support then there will be many invisible hands to support BJP, then they should keep in mind that spreading rumors and superstition is a crime in Maharashtra 
 ' (from input agency) thakare ne kaha, 'iske baavjood agar sthaneey bijepi netaa madhyavadhi chunaav ke bare main charchaa karte rahe, to unhen ek baar aisa karnaa chahie
 They may not have been aware of their party president's stand on the issue
 ' thakare ne kaha, 'agar mukhyamantri (devendra fadanvis) kehete hai ki agar shivasena samarthan waapas leti he to bijepi kaa samarthan karne ke liye anek adrishy haath honge to unhen is baat ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki afvaah failaana or andhvishwaas maharashtra main aparaadh he
 ' (input agency se) On July 10, the terrorists who kept a bad eye on the Amarnath Yatra in Jammu and Kashmir could not do it in the last 17 years
 na sirf bekhauf hokar tirthayatriyon kii bas ko nishaanaa banaaya balki hamale ke baad faraar bhi ho gaye
 And not just the bus, but also attacked the police personnel
 pradhanmantri samet puure desh ne is kyrana harakat kii ninda kii
 While the passengers were responsible for the negligence behind the attack, the government termed this act as the frustration of the terrorists
 magar hakeekat ye he ki kai gharon main matam pasar gaya
 When someone's shadow arose from someone's head, someone lost his son, brother and father
 to kya is hamale ko aatankiyon kii hataasha hi mana jaae
 Actually, the reasoning behind this claim is that the Modi government is acting strictly against terror in Kashmir
 vahiin ghati main bigadate halaat ko bhi isi kii pratikriya ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he
 But if we look at the handiwork of the terrorists in the recent past, then it seems that they are not desperate, their spirits have increased
 wo lagaataar apane napak mansoobon par amal karne main kaamyaab ho rahe hai
 They are having direct encounters with the security forces, they are also striving to enter their base camps and strike
 pathankot airbase atake2 janvari, 2016 ko tadake subah 3:30 baje punjab ke pathankot main airforce base par aatankiyon ne hamalaa kiya
 Seven soldiers were killed and 37 people were injured in the encounter
 haalanki, sabhi hamalavar aatanki bhi maare gaye
 But the terrorists had a lot of real ammo
 yahaan tak ki aatanki ek-47 jaise hathiyaar lekar aae the
 Which raises the question whether the government has failed to ban arms supply from across the border
 uri hamalaa19 sitambar 2016 ko jammu-kashmir ke uri main sena ke base camp par aatmghaatee hamalaa kiya gaya
 17 army soldiers were martyred in this attack
 haalanki, sena ne hamalaa karne aae chaaron aatankiyon ko bhi maar giraaya
 Pakistan marked marking material was recovered from these terrorists
 aatankiyon se chaar eke-47 or grenade baraamad hue
 Not only this, they also had weapons to fire
 yani ek baar phir sabit ho gaya ki aatanki seemaa paar se aae, vahiin se hathiyaar laae, vahiin se davaaiyaan or duusare saamaan laae or bharat kii seemaa main ghuskar sena ke base camp ko nishaanaa banane main kaamyaab ho gaye
 In pulwama-sopore, the militants targeted the camps of security forces in Pulwama and Sopore in Jammu and Kashmir on the night of 13 June this year
 sirf ek yaa do nahin, balki 6 campon par hamalaa kiya
 First attack - Grenade was thrown inside CRPF camp at Tral in Pulwama district
 hamale main nau jawan or ek afasar ghayal ho gaya
 Second attack - CRPF camp at Padgampora in Pulwama district with grenade attack
 teesraa hamalaa- pulavama main raat nau baje police thane par grenade phenkaa
 During this, there was firing between the police and the terrorists for about 15 minutes
 chauthaa hamalaa-pahalgam ke sarnal main siarpief camp par grenade se hamalaa kiya gaya
 However, there was no damage in this attack
 paanchvaan hamalaa- sopor ke pajalpura main sena ke camp par grenade se hamalaa
 There has been no report of any casualty in this attack
 yani aatankiyon ne ek hi raat surakshabalon ke 6 campon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Not only did they have modern weapons, but their numbers were also such that they carried out 6 attacks in a sequential manner
 isse jaahir hota he ki kahin na kahin aatankiyon funding or ghuspaith par lagaam nahin lagaai ja saki he
 However, after Aaj Tak's sting operation, the NIA has clamped down on several separatist leaders in charge of funding
 vahiin amarnath yatriyon par haalia hamale kii baat karen to sarkaar ke sutron se jaankaree mili he ki aatankiyon ne apane mubir chode hue the, jo tirthayatriyon kii aisi gadiyon ko follow kar rahe the, jinke saath surakshabalon kaa kafila maujuud na ho
 That is, the terrorists used their over ground network for this attack
 kyonki suraksha kavaj hatane ke 50 minute ke andar hi aatankiyon ne bas par dhaava bol diya, aise main ye jaahir hota he ki aatankiyon kaa sanchaar network bhi ghati main kaaphi majboot he
 Amidst all this, the army has recently prepared a list of terrorists present in the valley
 list ke aadhaar par sena ne aatankiyon ke khatme ke liye 'oparation clin sweep' shuru kiya he
 The Indian Army is constantly working in this direction and big faces of terror like Sabzar Bhatt have been frozen
 magar, aatanki funding, ghuspaith or hathiyaaron kii supplai jaise jin muddon par maujuuda sarkaar ke netritvkarta pehali sarkaar ko fail qaraar dete the, unheen network ke jariye aatanki apane napak mansoobon ko badhaane main aage badhate dikh rahe hai

 rahul raaj singh par apni premika or abhinetri pratyusha banerjee ko aatmahatya ke liye uksaane kaa maamla darj kiya gaya he
 Rahul's lawyer Neeraj Gupta said, "I have separated from the case on humanitarian grounds
 mujhe mahasoos hua ki mujhe yah cese nahin ladanaa chahie or isse alag ho gaya taaki kisi ke saath anyaay nahin ho
 'gupta claimed,' a client should give all the information, right or wrong, good or bad, to the lawyer, but i was kept in the dark and i got all the details related to the case from outside (media)
 ' When he was asked whether he changed his mind after a case was registered against Rahul? He then replied, 'the FIR has nothing to do with this decision
 ek vakil hameshaa aisi chizon ke liye taiyaar rahata he

 An FIR was registered against Rahul on Tuesday after a police FIR was registered on the basis of a complaint lodged by Pratyusha's mother Soma at the Banguranagar police station

 rahul ke vakil niraj gupta ne kaha, 'main maanviya aadhaar par maamle se alag hua hum
 i felt that i should not fight this case and got separated from it so that no injustice was done to anyone
 ' gupta ne daawa kiya, 'ek client ko sahi yaa galat, acchhee yaa buree, sabhi suchanaaen vakil ko deni chahie, lekin mujhe andhere main rakhaa gaya or mujhe maamle se sambandhit saare vivaran baahar (media) se mili
 ' jab unase yah sawaal kiya gaya ki kya rahul ke khilaaf maamla darj kiye jane ke baad unhone apana man badla he? tab unhone jawaab diya, 'praathmiki kaa is nirnay se kuch lenaa dena nahin he
 a lawyer is always ready for such things
 ' Significantly, Rahul is still hospitalized
 pratyusha kii maa soma dwaara bangurnagar police thane main darj karai gai shikaayat ke aadhaar par police ne ek praathmiki darj kii thi, jiske baad mangalvaar ko rahul ke khilaaf aatmahatya ke liye uksaane kaa maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 The police refused to give any information related to the investigation that led to the FIR
 police ko shaq he ki rahul ek anya mahila ke saath relationships main tha, jisaki vajah se abhinetri tanaav main thi
 a case has been registered against Rahul under sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 504, 506 (criminal intimidation), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC

 The comments police yah bhi pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahi he ki kya abhinetri ko kisi tarah kii vittiya pareshaani bhi thi yaa singh ke saath unka kisi tarah kaa vivaad hua tha
 According to some reports, the actress was unhappy about not getting a role in serials
 ravivaar ko, singh ko seene main dard or saans lene main takalif kii shikaayat ke baad kandivali ke ek aspataal ke isiu ward main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha

 In such a situation, Rahul will have to take steps towards healthcare

 For two consecutive years, ABVP, which has been holding the entire panel of DUSU, would like to do a hat-trick, while the NSUI is trying its best to make a comeback on DUSU panel

 Violation of Lyngdoh's recommendations According to Lyngdoh's recommendations, a student has a budget of about Rs 5,000 for campaigning in DUSU, but in terms of showing money and muscle power, ABVP and student organizations like NSUI spend millions
 engiti ke adeshon or lingadoh kii siforeeshon ke ulanghan ke maamle main dusu ellection cameti ne chaatro ko notice bhi diya he
 But according to the ABVP candidates, this is a conspiracy of the opposing parties, while the NSUI is trying to dismiss it as the enthusiasm of the supporters

 Is Virat Kohli's batting under the captaincy pressure? Why Virat Kohli's decisions are being proved wrong? Why can't they test the ball? In the second innings of the Pune Test, he dropped the ball of Steve o Keefe

 It was clear that Kohli could not understand the turn of the ball

 bharat samet duniyabar ke rahtakarmi yahaan pahunch rahe hai
 They are bringing with them large quantities of food items, medicines, tents, blankets etc
 ye sab alag-alag deshon se aa rahi sarkari sahaayta se alag he
 But most of these relief materials are deposited at the airport itself
 wo isliye ki sarkaar ise apane sarkari tantra ke zarie baantnaa chaahati he
 The reasoning is that this relief material will actually reach the needy people
 ye kuch haathon main hi simat kar nahin rah jaaegi
 This government rule has its advantages and disadvantages
 sarkari tantra itnaa bada or chust nahin ki bukamp se tabah har sudoorvarti ilaake tak pahunch sake
 Therefore, relief material has started coming up in the airport and government warehouses, while the earthquake victims of remote areas are looking for relief
 kuch videshi rahtakarmi jo apane registerd bagez ke rup main raahat saamagree lekar aa rahe hai vahi use apane saath lekar baahar nikal paa rahe hai
 The local people of Kathmandu have formed a voluntary organization called Helping Hand, who are engaged in transporting relief material directly to such remote areas
 zarurat adhik he or baahar se sidhi sahaayta aisi sansthaaon tak nahin pahunch rahi he
 So they have started collecting material themselves
 log badi taadaad main madad ko aage aa rahe hai
 Especially the section of the traders of Nepal has opened up in it
 tippaniyan As the news of such efforts is spreading, people themselves are also transporting goods to the institution by loading goods

 shatrughna sinha patna sahib se congress ummidavaar hai
 Shatrughan Sinha has won this seat twice before, but this time his contest is slightly different as this time he is contesting on Congress ticket
 shatrughna sinha pichley kai dinon se pradhanmantri modi or bijepi par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 Shatrughan Sinha was born on 9 December 1945 in Patna
 unhen bataur abhinayta pahchaan mili
 He did his early studies from Patna Science College
 iske baad vah FTII pune acting seekhney chal gaye
 After studying, he moved to Mumbai to pursue a career in films

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special news letters Movie Review: Krrish 3 Director: Rakesh roshanactor: Hrithik Roshan, Priyanka Chopra, Kangana Ranaut, Vivek Oberradiation: 2 hours 32 minutes Out of five, three and a half starkrish is a thinking name
 iske peeche dimag he diarector rakesh roshan kaa or sharir he ruthik roshan kaa
 And in the jugalbandi of these two, this spice and entertaining film has become a lot
 ummid he ki diwaali ke pehle box offis par jo sookhaa besaram or bos ke bakawaas hone ke chalate padaa tha, wo dhadaam ho jayega
 The recap occurs at the beginning of Krish 3
 ek scientist pita or homemekar maa kaa betaa rohit, jo chot ke chalate shaareerik rup se to bada hota he
 But not mentally
 duniya se hairaan or pareshaan rohit ko madad milti he dhoop se chalate kute nile jaadu se
 In the second part, we saw that Rohit's son Krishna, who appears in his super avatar as Krish, tackles another villain and also finds his beloved as Priya
 to phir thart part main kya hota he
 Another Willem brotherhood appears
 naam he kaal
 He has a disease, due to which only the head and two fingers are in action
 baaki dhad nishchal he
 This form reminds us of the great physicist Stephen Hawkins
 bas yaad hi dilaataa he kyonki kaal kamajarf insaan he or duniya kii barabaadi par hansata he
 In front of him is our super hero Krrish who is set with his father Rohit and wife Priya and drives away small problems
 kaal kii team kii baat karen to usne shaareerik aapangata ke baavjood apane tej dimag or vigyaan ke balbuule maanwar (maavan plus jaanavar) bana die hai
 The most important among them is Kaya, which is a mixed form of human and chameleon
 yani usamen kai takat hai or vah manachaaha rup badal sakati he
 There is also a Manavar with a tongue, which we have seen in the trailer has been sufficiently perturbed
 film main hota he kaal or krish main muqabla
 The film rests on the strong shoulders of Hrithik Roshan and he performs this responsibility well
 darshakon ko vah apane maacho avatar krish main to lubhaate hi hai, jeebh ko kuch dabaakar bolne vaale rohit ke rup main bhi ek kirdaar kii vaapasi acchhee lagati he
 The magic of the first film seems to be born
 priyanka chopra ke hisse karne ko zyada kuch tha nahin or jitna tha, use unhone thik thaak nibhaayaa
 The surprise element of the film is Kangana Ranavat in the role of Kaya and Vivek Oberoi, who coaxes Kaal
 kangana ke liye film main lead heroin priyanka se zyada gunjaaish thi or ise unhone bakhubi bhunaaya
 Like the chameleon, his character also rotates at 180 degrees and during this time there is no uncomfortable feeling from anywhere
 vivek obray, jin par camera jab tehra, chehre par hi tehra, vajah unka kirdaar, hamen ek baar phir aashwast karte hai ki saathiya ko acting aati he, bas sahi filmon kaa chunaav nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Apart from this, Rajpal Yadav is also in a small role in the film, in which he takes a pinch of amchur powder and leaves a tickle on the tongue
 film kii kahani main ection or imoshan kaa mixchar he or yah puri tarah se antertenment or indian audiyans ke test ko dhyaan main rakhte hue banaai gai he
 Editing is tight, so the pace of the film is maintained and there is no boredom anywhere
 krish 3 kaa ek or shandaar pahalu he, iske ection or special effects
 It does not seem that any Indians are watching films shuruyaat main plane kii landig ke dauraan krish ke kamaal se lekar kaal kii team or phir aakhir main kaal se bhidnt tak sab kuch hamen seat par chipkaae rakhata he
 The film's weak side is its songs
 bataaya jaataa tha ki diarector rakesh roshan ke sangeetkaar bhai rajesh roshan apana best bhaiya ke liye bachaakar rakhte hai
 It seems that this best has already been spent and the scraps left now are extremely stale
 raghupati raghav rajaraam gaanaa yaad rahata he to bas ruthik ke kuch aise shandaar muves ke liye, jinhen launde dekhne ke baad agali dance party yaa aane vaale shaadi sijan main ghanghor dhang se gira denge nirantar abhyaas ke baad
 Another song Dil
 
 
 camere kii lachak or site seen ke lihaaj se hi memri bank main kuch kebi kii jagah paata he
 The third song God Allah Ishwar is utter nonsense and provides the only pure thigh moment in the film
 krish 3 dekhie, agar aapako lagata he ki un sab logon ke andar ek superhiro he, jo dusron ke chehre par muskaan laane ke liye kaam karte hai
 This is a good Diwali package for children, in which there is nothing vulgar or over
 na romance zyada oonh aanh karata he, na ection zyada khun khachchar se labarej he
 This is a perfect masala film, which will prove to be a good family entertainer
 vidhayak anil murmu ke nidhan ke baad pakur jile ke littipada vidhansabha seat par ho rahe upachunaav main soobe ke donon bade rajanithik dalon kii saakh daanv par lagi he
 In this election, while the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has a challenge to save its traditional seat, on the other hand, the Raghuvar Das government of the state is also trying to cement its development claim by waving the seat on this seat
 darasal is chunaav main jeemem kii mushkilen zyada hai
 The wife of the late MLA has put JMM on the backfoot by claiming the claim of the late MLA on Dawa Thonkais seat
 darasal is seat par jeemem basant sorain ko khadaa karne kaa man bana chuki thi, jo shibu sorain ke bete or purv mukhyamantri hemanth sorain ke chote bhai hai
 At the same time, the local BJP leader Stephen Marandi, who had left the BJP for the ticket, was also waiting for the ticket from the JMM
 lekin tikat paane kii bheed ko dekhte hue unhone nirdaleey chunaav ladane kaa faisla liya he
 BJP has put a bet on Murmu, in view of this arrogance created in JMM, he has given ticket to Hemlal Murmu
 murmu kii bhi sthaneey janata ke bich khaasi pakad he
 In such a situation, if the JMM shows any failure or hurry in taking the decision, then it may have to face the brunt of its vote-sharing
 jeemem kaa garh rahaa he littiparasanthalpargana kaa naksalgrast littipada jeemem kii paramparaagat seat rahi he
 JMM has been consistently winning here for almost forty years
 idhar, bijepi jeemem ke is garh main send lagane kii jugat main lagi he
 Seeing this as an opportunity, the party is ready to go to the polls to win this by-election
 gauratlab he ki 2014 kevidhansabha chunaavamein party ne gathbandhan ke tahat yah seat lojpa ko saunp di thi
 The Supreme Court had prohibited the cutting of saw trees by Nehru, the foundation of the colony was laid by Nehru on March 4, 1951

 If we look at the dispute of Aarey Colony, it is quite old, whether it is a forest area or an eco zone, its history is equally interesting
 is colony kii neenv desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ne rakhi thi or yahaan ped bhi lagaaya tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation Four years after the country gained independence in 1947, on 4 March 1951, the then Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation of Aarey Milk Colony with the aim of promoting the dairy industry by planting trees
 PM nehru ke yahaan paudharopan ke baad is ilaake main itane ped rope gaye ki 3166 acre kshetrafal main faile bhubhag ne kuch hi samay main jangal kaa rup le liya
 Aarey Milk Colony covers many areas of Mumbai, including Sai, Gundgaon, Film City, Royal Palm, Aarey, Pahari Goregaon, Paspoli
 is kshetra main kai filmon kii shooting ho chuki he, raat main yahaan ke kuch raaston se nikalne par roak bhi lagaai gai he
 What is the project of Mumbai metro? In Mumbai, there is a problem of public traffic, there is no other means than the local train which can carry the burden of millions of passengers
 2014 main yahaan pehali metro ai to logon ko kaaphi raas ai, jiske baad iske vistaar kii baat chhid gai
 During the expansion, when the metro shed was required, the forest of Aare Colony, which is called the lung of Mumbai, was equal to the film city
 shed ke liye kisi or sthaan par jagah nahin mili to sarkaar kii ore se aare ke pedo main hi shed banane kaa faisla hua
 Movements started in Mumbai, everyone from the common man to the leader and actor started campaigning for # saveaarey
 maamla neshnal green tribunel (NGT), bombai hoicourt tak pahunch gaya tha
 But permission was also received from the NGT at first and later the Bombay High Court also refused to accept it as a forest
 4 march 1951 ko aare milk colony main jawahar laal nehrusupreme court ne ant main laga di rokebombay hoicourt se maharashtra sarkaar ko ijaajat mili to turant ped kataai kaa kaam shuru ho gaya
 a total of around 2600 trees were to be cut, of which more than 2000 trees were also cut
 lekin maamla supreme court pahunchaa or adaalat ne maharashtra sarkaar se turant pedo kii kataai rokane ko kah diya, saath hi ye bhi record maanga ki abhi tak kitne ped kaate gaye hai
 However, the Maharashtra government says that all the trees they had to cut for the metro have been cut down
 aage vah koi ped nahin kaatenge
 At least six people were killed and 15 injured when a bomb exploded in a crowded market in the Aurakzai tribal area of northwest Pakistan
 aurakajai agency ke hasanjai bazaar main ek taange main bam chhipaakar rakhaa gaya tha
 Radio Pakistan reported that six people were killed and 15 others were injured in the bombing
 hamale ke liye kisi bhi samooh ne jimmedaari nahin lee he
 The Orakzai Agency is one of the seven autonomous tribal districts of northwest Pakistan
 radio pakistan ne khabar di he ki bam visphot main chah log maare gaye or 15 anya ghayal ho gaye
 No group claimed responsibility for the attack
 orkajai agency pashchimottar pakistan ke saat swaitshasi kabyli jilon main se ek he
 Have you also realized that whenever it comes to Pakistan, a large part of our media starts spreading the frenzy of war, defying India's restraint, but when it comes to China, it is the language of the media and its anchors In defense, there is a terminology of strategy but do not kill, burst, show two types of road impression analysis 
 netaa, mantri yaa pravaktaa bhi shaleen nazar aa rahe hai
 On the pretext of China, at least, the discussion on TV seems to be that there is not much wrong
 hamaare ankar or channel puri tarah se shaleenta se charchaa karnaa nahin bhuule hai
 The scale of coverage that the Indian media has created regarding Pakistan seems to be an out-of-syllabus in the context of China
 haal hi main praveen sohani or gazala wahaab kii ek kitaab pard rahaa tha dragon on aavar dorstep
 This book gave a Chinese game theme
 ise go kehete hai
 Journalist Praveen was told by the officer of the Chinese Army PLA about the game that we do not like chess, we like Go
 aaj kii duniya main apni kshamta ko chhipaana mushkil ho gaya he
 This game teaches us that intention is not known in any way while walking
 sab pataa chal jaae magar kisi tarah manshaa kaa pataa na chale
 This game has been played in China for two and a half thousand years
 is khel main jo sabase pehle safed yaa kaali goti se board ko bhar detaa he vahi vijayi mana jaataa he
 Praveen Sauhni has written that on the next day of this conversation while he was roaming in the market, everywhere he saw Go, which is called Wei Ki in Chinese language
 shatranj nahin
 He was told by another army officer that China fights only when its interests are affected
 doklam kshetra main 18 june ko jo hua he uske baad se kuch nayaa nahin hua he
 But daily statements are coming at different levels
 kabhi beijing se to kabhi dilli ke chini duutavas se
 On July 6, Chinese Counselor of Chinese Embassy in Delhi, Li Ya has released a video statement
 bayaan agrezi main he
 i am reading this translation
 is video bayaan main lee yaa kah rahe hai ki pehle ke vivaadon ke samay bhartiya adhikari bharat ke bheetar jan bhaavana kaa hawala dete hue china se aagrah karte rahe hai ki vah apni sena ko peeche hataa le
 Therefore, it becomes very important for Chinese diplomacy to speak directly to the Indian public
 bharat main chini duutavas ke adhikari bahut zyaada media main nahin aate hai
 On June 18, there was a scuffle between the two countries on the indo-china border along the Sikkim sector
 1890 main britain or china ke bich tibet or sikkim ko lekar ek samjhauta hua tha, jiske tahat britain ne china ke liye is sector par apni daavedaari chhod di thi
 India is claiming that Doklam is from Bhutan
 bharat apni suraksha ko lekar chintit he
 As far as i know, this claim of India is wrong
 hamaare paas pramaan hai ki doklam china kaa he
 Doklam has traditionally been a pasture area for those living near the Chinese border
 shi jang swytt kshetra ke archive main bhutani charavaahon ke die grass tex yani ghaas kar kii raseed bhi he
 This will not be accepted by any sovereign nation
 samaadhaan yahi he ki bharat apni tukdi hataa le
 Unconditionally and that too quickly
 iske bagair bharat or china ke bich koi bhi manikez baatcheet nahin ho sakati he
 Earlier on Wednesday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman from Beijing made a similar statement, before that the Chinese Ambassador to Delhi also reiterated the same thing, saying that India has violated the international treaty
 china lagaataar apana bayaan de rahaa he or propeganda kar rahaa he
 So far only one formal statement has come from India
 bharat kaa maananaa he ki jo kahana tha kah diya
 The defense minister and the army chief also came up with a statement
 is bich guuruuvaar subah pitiai ke hawaale se khabar ai ki ji-20 ke liye germany pahunch rahe bharat ke pradhanmantri or china ke raashtrapati ke bich dwipaksheeya vaarta nahin hogi
 China has refused to negotiate because there is no atmosphere of dialogue
 pitiai ne yah khabar chini videsh mantralay ke adhikariyon ke hawaale se yah jari kii thi
 Following this news, India's Foreign Ministry immediately responded and said that India's bilateral meeting is scheduled with Argentina, Canada, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Britain and Vietnam
 iske saath hi pradhanmantri modi bricks netaaon kii baithak main hissaa lenge, jisamen koi badlaav nahin hua he
 In a way, the Ministry of External Affairs has indicated that if the talks between Prime Minister Modi and the President of China were not fixed, then from where will be canceled
 bricks deshon kii alag se baithak tay he usamen bharat, brazil, rus, dakshin africa or china ke raashtra pramukh bhi ek kamare main honge
 Will be face to face is par ek nayaa vivaad chhid gaya ki beijing main chini videsh mantralay ke adhikariyon ne bhartiya reportron se jo kaha use aadhikarik bayaan ke transcripshan main isliye nahin aayaa kyonki wo aadhikarik rup se nahin kaha gaya tha
 One information also says this
 pitiai ne baad main ek sanshodhit copy jari ki jisamen kaha ki agyaat sutron ke hawaale se aisa kaha gaya tha
 The tension is in Doklam and the swinging picture is swinging on TV
 2014 main bharat aae china ke raashtrapati shi chin fing ke swaagat main pradhanmantri modi ne koi kami nahin kii thi
 Then Prime Minister of India, Modi also gave this trip a name
 eench tuards miles
 Inch inch means India and China
 jaise israel main unhone kaha ki ai for ai matlab india for israel
 We understood the meaning of the inch more and China understood something else
 us saal ladakh ke paas chumaar main chini tukdi do kimi andar aa gai
 Road making
 bharat ne sakht etraz kiya or apni tukdi tainaat kar di
 When a Chinese citizen stood up with his flag in Demchauk, an Indian citizen also stood with a tricolor in front
 in vivaadon ke bich bhi sabarmati ke tat par pradhanmantri or raashtrapati jhula jhulate rahe
 China had to return from its position
 2015 main pradhanmantri modi ne bhi china kii yatra kii to unka bhi bhavy swaagat kiya gaya
 After this, President Xi Chin Fing came to Goa in 2016 to participate in the BRICS meeting
 tippaniyan In 2014, President Xi Chin Fing supported Prime Minister Modi's statement in a Hindu newspaper that Modi is right to say that India and China are two lives
 is vakt do jism do jaan kyon nazar aa rahe hai
 Everything was going well, but why is this happening now? vahaan ke akhbaar global times kaa sampadakeey chidhaane vaala hi he
 This newspaper is of the government type, so the government's opinion of the newspaper is less
 isane likhaa he ki bharat kaa bhutan par niyantran he isliye bhutan ne china se rajanyik sambandh kaayam nahin kiya he
 India has damaged Bhutan's diplomatic sovereignty through disparate treaties because of its security interests
 bharat ne sikkam par bhi apni nitiyon ko thopa he
 India is demonstrating its territorial dominance over the border by resorting to Bhutan's help this time
 bharat ko iske liye sabak sikhaanaa chahie
 The world should think that India is somehow suppressing the Himalayan countries
 antarrashtriya samudaay ko bhutan kii pareshaani samajni chahie or chote rajyon ke daman se bharat ko rokna chahie
 What China wants, its intention is like a Go game whose principle rests on it that something should happen, the intention should not be known
 kya china bharat ke khilaaf vivaad se propeganda karnaa chahta he
 He is doing all this for Pakistan or for himself
 bhutan to bharat ke saath he magar china bhutan ke liye kyon ro rahaa he
 It is called Go
 patrkaar praveen ko chini sena piele ke adhikari ne is khel ke bare main bataaya tha ki ham shatranj nahin pasand karte hai, go hi pasand karte hai
 In today's world it has become difficult to hide our potential
 yah khel hamen sikhaata he ki chaal chalate vakt kisi bhi tarah iraade kaa pataa na chale
 Everyone knows but intention is not known in any way
 yah khel china main do dhai hazaar saal se khelaa ja rahaa he
 In this game, the first person who fills the board with white or black band is considered victorious
 praveen sohani ne likhaa he ki is baatcheet ke agle din jab ve bazaar main gum rahe the to har jagah go jise chini bhashaa main vei kii kehete hai, bikate dekha
 Not chess
 unhen ek or sena adhikari ne bataaya tha ki china tabhi ladata he jab uskaa hit prabhavit hota he
 Nothing new has happened in the Doklam area since what happened on 18 June
 lekin alag-alag str par rose bayaan zarur aa rahe hai
 Sometimes from Beijing or sometimes from the Chinese Embassy in Delhi
 6 july ko dilli sthit chini duutavas ke raajnneetik counslar lee yaa ne ek video bayaan jari kiya he
 The statement is in English
 iskaa anuwaad main pard rahaa hum
 In this video statement, Lee is saying that during earlier disputes, Indian officials have been urging China to withdraw its army, citing public sentiment within India
 isliye chini kootneeti ke liye yah kaaphi mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki ham sidhe bhartiya janata se hi baat karen
 Chinese Embassy officials in India do not come in very much media
 18 june ko bharat china seemaa se lage sikkim sector ke paas donon mulkon kii tukadiyon main hathapayee jaisi hui
 In 1890, Britain and China reached an agreement on Tibet and Sikkim, under which Britain gave up its claim to the sector for China
 bharat daawa kar rahaa he ki doklam bhutan kaa he
 India is concerned about its security
 jahaan tak meri jaankaree he, bharat kaa yah daawa galat he
 We have evidence that Doklam is from China
 doklam, chini seemaa ke paas rahane waalon ke liye paaramparik rup se charaagaah kaa kshetra rahaa he
 There is also a receipt of grass tax i
e
 grass tax given to Bhutanese shepherds in the Archive of Xi Zhang Autonomous Region
 yah kisi bhi samprabhu raashtra ko manzur nahin hoga
 The solution is that India should remove its troops
 bina kisi shart ke or wo bhi jaldi
 Without this, there can be no negotiated dialogue between India and China
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko beijing se bhi videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne isi tarah kaa bayaan diya, usase pehle dilli sthit china ke rajdoot ne bhi yahi baat doharaate hue kaha ki bharat ne antarrashtriya sandhi kaa ulanghan kiya he
 China is constantly making its statement and propaganda
 abhi tak bharat kii taraf ek hi aupchaarik bayaan aayaa he
 India believes that it has said what it had to say
 raksha mantri or senadhyaksh kaa bhi ek hi baar bayaan aayaa
 Meanwhile, on Thursday morning, PTI was quoted as saying that there would be no bilateral talks between the Prime Minister of India and the President of China arriving in Germany for the G20
 china ne baatcheet se manaa kar diya he kyonki baatcheet kaa maahaul nahin he
 PTI had issued this news citing officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry
 is khabar ke baad bharat ke videsh mantralay ne turant pratikriya di or kaha ki bharat kii dwipaksheeya baithak argentina, canada, italy, japan, mexico, dakshin korea, britain or vietnam ke saath tay he
 With this, Prime Minister Modi will participate in the meeting of BRICS leaders, in which there is no change
 ek tarah se videsh mantralay ne ishaare se bataa diya ki pradhanmantri modi or china ke raashtrapati ke bich baatcheet tay hi nahin thi to radd kahaan se hogi
 a separate meeting of BRICS countries is scheduled in which the heads of nations of India, Brazil, Russia, South Africa and China will also be in one room
 aamane saamne to honge
 a new controversy erupted over what the Chinese Foreign Ministry officials told Indian reporters in Beijing did not get into the transcription of the official statement because it was not officially stated
 ek jaankaree yah bhi kahati he
 PTI later issued a revised copy stating that it was said by quoting unknown sources
 tanaav doklam main hua he or tivi par jhule vaali tasviir jhul rahi he
 Prime Minister Modi did nothing to welcome the Chinese President Xi Chin Fing who came to India in 2014
 tab bharat ke pradhanmantri modi ne is yatra ko ek naam bhi diya
 Inch Tuards Miles
 eench inch matlab india or china
 Like in Israel he said i for i means India for Israel
 ham eench kaa kuch or matlab samaj rahe the or china kuch or samaj gaya
 That year, a Chinese contingent moved two km inside Chumar near Ladakh
 sadak banane
 India objected strongly and deployed its troops
 demchowk main chini naagarik apana jhanda lekar khadaa ho gaya to saamne se bhartiya naagarik bhi tirangaa lekar khadaa ho gaya
 Even amid these controversies, the Prime Minister and the President kept swinging on the banks of the Sabarmati
 china ko hi apni sthiti se waapas janaa padaa
 When Prime Minister Modi also visited China in 2015, he was also given a grand welcome
 iske baad 2016 main raashatrapati shi chin fing goa bhi aae the bricks kii baithak main hissaa lene

 Why are two bodies visible at this time? sab to thik hi chal rahaa tha par ab ye kyon ho rahaa he
 The editor of the newspaper Global Times is teasing
 yah akhbaar sarkari tip kaa he isliye akhbaar kaa kam sarkaar kaa mat zyaada lagata he
 It has written that because India has control over Bhutan, Bhutan has not established diplomatic relations with China
 bharat ne apane suraksha hiton ke kaaran asasmaan sandhiyon ke zariye bhutan kii kootnithik samprabhutaa ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 India has also imposed its policies on Sikkam
 bharat is baar bhutan kii madad kaa sahaara lekar seemaa par apane kshetreey prabhutv kaa pradarshan kar rahaa he
 India should teach a lesson for this
 duniya ko gaur karnaa chahie ki bharat kisi tarah himalayan deshon ko dabaa rahaa he
 The international community should understand Bhutan's troubles and stop India from suppressing small states
 china chahta kya he, uskaa iraadaa us go khel kii tarah he jiskaa siddhant hi is par tikaa he ki kuch ho jaae, iraade kaa pataa nahin chalanaa chahie
 Does China want propaganda from the dispute against India

 The objective of this new policy is to simplify rules like permanent membership for qualifications, high degree holders and those holding professional qualifications

 The Supreme Court today made it clear that it cannot interfere in religious decrees or fatwas issued by Muslim religious leaders

 We cannot decide on these
 is desh main kuch log maanate hai ki ganga jal sabhi bimariyon ko thik kar saktaa he
 It is a matter of personal reverence
 ' Significantly, Vishwalochan Madan, a Delhi-based lawyer, had filed a PIL challenging the parallel courts run by entities like Darul Kaja and Darul Ifta, on which the Supreme Court reserved its order while hearing
 madan kaa tark tha ki aise fatvon kii vajah se ek muslim ladki ko apane pati ko chhodkar apane us sasur ke saath rahanaa padaa jis par usne rape kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Madan said that Darul Qaza and darul-ifta are active in 52 to 60 districts of the country, where Muslims reside in large numbers
 unhone kaha ki musalmaan fatvon ko chunauti tak nahin de sakate, jabaki ye fatve unki jindagi or naagarik ke taur par unki aazaadee main dakhal daalate hai
 On this, the court told lawyer Madan that you are becoming more drummatic
 adaalat ne kaha, 'aap zyada drumatic na hon, us ladki kaa bachaav ham karenge
 You are understanding that all edicts are malicious
 kuch fatve samajhadaari bhare bhi ho sakate hai or logon ke liye phydemand ho sakate hai
 The people of this country are very intelligent
 agar do musalmaan madhyasthata karaane ke liye raji hai to is par koun roak laga saktaa he?' At the same time, the Muslim Personal Law Board argued that if a fatwa affects the fundamental right, one can knock the court

 Voting was held for the assembly by-elections in Bandra East and tasgaon-kavathe Mahakal seats in Maharashtra on Saturday

 the tasgaon-kavathe Mahakal seat is contested between Suman Patil, wife of former state Home Minister RR Patil and bjp's rebel candidate Swapnil Patil
 bandra east shivasena kaa garh he or yaheen matoshri main thakare parivaar rahata he
 Bala Sawant of Shiv Sena was an MLA for two consecutive terms from this seat
 unke nidhan ke baad upachunaav main party ne unki patni tripti saavant ko maidan main utaara
 In the 2014 assembly elections, BJP stood second from this seat, but this time it did not field any of its candidates
 thakare parivaar ko unke garh main chunauti dene utre shivasena se saalon pehle baagi hue narayan rane
 The situation became such that Sharad Pawar, who has never campaigned in any by-election in history, also took the front, because if Rane wins, the opposition will get new energy in the assembly and the political exile will be prolonged
 is seat par res main emm ke siraaj khan bhi hai, jo 2014 main tisare number par rahe the
 The Owaisi brothers had also given full force in Khan's propaganda
 bandra east main lagbhag 2
 There are 5 lakh voters, of which 80,000 are Muslim and 50,000 are Dalits

 In Maharashtra, in the second seat i
e
tasgaon-kavathe Mahankal, the contest is between Suman Patil, wife of former Home Minister RR Patil and Swapanil Patil of BJP rebel, along with 7 Independents
 ensipi ne saare raajnneetik dalon se anurodh kiya tha ki wo suman ke khilaaf kisi ko maidan main nahin utaare, yahi aabaa ko sachhee shradhanjali hogi, baaki partiyon ne unki baat maanakar kisi ummidavaar ko tikat nahin diya
 But Swapnil Patil opened a front against the party
 matdaan ke baad suman patil ne kaha, "mujhe vishwaas he ki log mujhe puraa samarthan denge or main bade antar se jitungi, in chunaavon main sirf sahanubhuti kii lahar nahin he, balki aaraar patil ke kaam ke prati jo logon kaa pyaar or vishwaas tha, ye uski lahar he
 "swapnil Patil said that RR Patil was a good man, but he left many things incomplete
 yahaan kisaanon ke khet main pani nahin he
 
 
 People are angry, they will vote for us
 " donon siton ke liye hue upachunaav kaa nateeja 15 april ko aayega

 The leaders are leaving the party and running away
 pradesh adhyaksh tak chunaav ladgaye se manaa kar rahaa he, kyonki use dar he ki vah kisi bhi seat se chunaav nahin jeet saktaa
 And the condition of BJP is worse than that
 bijepi main sirf vahi log ja rahe hai, jinhen kahin se tikat nahin mil rahaa
 BJP has neither organization nor cadre
 bijepi kii sari hawa nikalne vaali he
 After all, what happened in three months that weakened BJP winning seven out of 10 seats in Haryana? Lok Sabha elections are held on different issues
 ab dekhie, uttarakhand main loksabhaa ke baad hue upachunaav main bijepi kaise aundhe munh gir gai
 The thing is that the reality of the promises made by Modi ji are coming before the people
 pradhanmantri kehete hai—bhrashtachar hataao
 The leader of the opposition gives such a statement, you are the PM, remove corruption, who has stopped you? How are you talking about corruption, your father and brother are behind bars? God wanted Chautala saheb and Ajay bhai soon He will come out of jail
 mujhe nyaay vyavastha par puraa bharosa he
 If you read the order of the court, then it is not written anywhere that Chautala has appointed with the money
 na hi yah likhaa he ki kisi rishtedaar kii niyukti kii he
 In the list we got, we posted those whose names were there
 sajaa to galat list banane waalon ko milegi
 How many seats are you expecting to win in this election? What should i say, understand these seats, will form the government with absolute majority

 How many seats are to be election 342 seats National Assembly 371 seats Punjab Province Assembly 124 seats Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly 65 seats Balochistan Assembly 168 seats Sindh Assembly kaun-kaun Maidan? The claim of PML-N led by Nawaz Sharif is said to be the strongest in this election
 lekin panama paper li maamle main supreme court ne nawaz ko kisi bhi tarah kaa padbhaar grahan karne par roak laga di he
 Yet Nawaz Sharif is the face of the party, he is also promoting the party but the party is currently commanded by his brother Shahbaz Sharif

 At present, the party is headed by the party general secretary Muhammad Amjad
 saath hi in chunaavon main lashkar-e-taiyaba chif hafiz said kii party 'allaah-hu-akbar taharik' (aeti) bhi maidan main hogi
 How will it affect India? Nawaz Sharif's party pml-n's attitude towards India has been soft compared to all the parties in Pakistan
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath nawaz ke achche rishte rahai hai
 Therefore, India will not have to make any drastic changes in its foreign policy with respect to Pakistan
 Even if Imran Khan's tehreek-e-insaf party is elected to power, its close relations with the Pakistan Army and their stand on Kashmir are believed by experts
 Is that it will be challenging for bilateral relations of both countries

 As soon as the Nobel Prize for Literature was announced, there was a wave of happiness across the country
 awwal to logon ko is baat kaa sukun tha ki ye puraskaar ‘half garlfriend’ jaisi mahaan rachana ke baad bhi chetan bhagat ko nahin mila
 Even more happy were the supporters of Narendra Modi who did not hear the name of the winner properly
 haalanki patric ‘modi’yano kaa puraa naam or rashtriyata sunate hi unki khushi kafoor ho gai
 Also announced the Nobel Peace Prize, which was jointly awarded to Kailash Satyarthi of India and Malala Yusufzai of Pakistan
 aise ashaanti bhare vaataavaran main jab bharat or pakistan kii senaayen seemaa par har ghadi ek-duusare se loha le rahi hai tab bharat or pakistan ke do logon ko sanyukt rup se ‘shanti’ kaa nobel puraskaar milane kii baat sun munh dabaate-dabaate meri hansi chhot gai

 sapa mukhiya ke aligarh muslim uniwarsity (eemyu) kaa program cancil ho gaya he
 According to the scheduled program, Mulayam Singh was supposed to talk to the students at Kennedy Hall at AMU on Monday morning at 11
30 am
 iske baad guest house main vidhayakon or sanghathan ke padaadhikariyon se milanaa tha, lekin ab kuch nahin hoga
 The reason behind the cancellation of Mulayam's AMU visit is being told to the Legislative Council Election Code of Conduct, but there are two big reasons behind the curtain
 pehali, eemyu ke chaatro kaa purajor virodh
 Second, the politics of local organization
 mujffarnagar dangon ko lekar soobe sahit desh bhar ke musalmaan sapa se khaase naaraaz hai
 Even as soon as Mulayam's program was decided, the students started taking out protest marches
 doosraa bada kaaran rahaa ki sanghathan nahin chahta tha ki sthaneey netaa khalid masood kaa kad bade
 Khalid Masood, once a student of BSP, is also surrounded by controversies
 aise main party ke sanghathan se jude netaa nahin chaahate the ki is baar khalid ko is kaam main koi safalataa mili
 Khalid, who took the status of Minister of State by becoming the President of Fakhruddin Society, had announced to bring Mulayam to AMU
 us vakt na to jila sanghathan or na hi vidhayakon ko bharose main liya gaya
 In such a situation, legislators and district organization officials also kept away from this program

 com / f5obwakwwq Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is facing a lot of criticism due to an argument with the umpire over the decision of no ball during the IPL match against Rajasthan Royals
 ‘captain kool’ dhoni ne apane swabhaav ke vipareet aapa kho diya or dag out se baahar nikalakar ampire se bahes karne lage
 Umpire Ulhas Gandhe called Ben Stokes a no-ball but changed the decision after a consultation with the square-leg umpire
 dhoni par match fees kaa 50 pratishat jurmaana lagaaya gaya
 Dhoni has been criticized by former England captain Michael Vaughan, former Australia opener Mark Waugh, former India cricketers Akash Chopra and Hemang Badani

 mujhe pataa he ki vah emes dhoni he or is desh main vah kuch bhi kar sakate hai, lekin dagout se nikalakar ampire par ungali uthaanaa sahi nahin he
 As a captain, he has set a wrong example
 ’don’t tweet utter Rubbish

 dhoni ne galat paripati kaayam kii
 'it was poor umpiring
 Totally agree
 But guess what
 
 
 it’s within the laws of the game for an umpire to revoke his decision if he feels he’s made a mistake
