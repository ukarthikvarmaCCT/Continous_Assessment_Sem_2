 moro ne kaha ki singhvi prakashkon ko daraa rahe hai
 Moro said that if the book has not come in the market, then i do not understand how it came in the hands of Singhvi and others
 unhone pustak kaa sanskaran avaidh tareeke se praapt kiya he
 i am preparing to file a case against him
 ’’moro ne kaha, ‘‘tab tak unhone 2004 main loksabhaa chunaavon jeet hasil kii or meri kahani kaa ek acha upsanhaar mujhe mil gaya
 "the author made it clear that he has nothing to do with the Congress party, but the matter is with his lawyer
" unhone kaha, ‘‘abhishek manu singhvi jaise log lekhak ko pareshaan kar rahe hai jisaki kitaab bazaar main aayi tak nahin he
 The whole matter seems meaningless
 ’’haalanki moro ne yah saaf nahin kiya ki unhone sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii thi yaa nahin
 Moro said, "there is no word from Sonia Gandhi regarding the book
" mujhe kabhi pareshaan nahin kiya gaya
 The Congress party has nothing to do with this

 On Wednesday, the rain stopped after 3 hours, but in such a time, every path from mango to special, every area was groaned by waterlogging and jam
 vyavastha or prashasan kii pole khuli so alag
 The capital of the country is notorious for not getting rains, but when Indra Dev blesses the rain here, it does not take time for the government agencies to open the poll
 kabhi lutian ne dilli ke kuch hisson ko sanvaara tha
 But the effort to learn over time was probably never in Delhi's rulers
 yahi kaaran he ki dilli-ensiaar kii talab main badal chuki sadaken ghatiya drenez system kii dein hai
 Alam is that there is a strong jam on the highway to the flyover
 30 fisadi ghat gai he drenez kii kshamtafilhal jalairao shahar ke liye ek badi chunauti he, jise bade paimaane majboot karne kii jarurat he
 On the deteriorating drainage system of delhi-ncr, Aaj Tak has a special conversation with the well-known town planner AK Jain of the city
 unhone bataaya, 'dilli kaa drenez system 70 saal purana he
 There used to be a population of 2 million then
 aaj aabaadi 2 karod ke aasapaas he
 Where drainage capacity should have increased by 30 per cent, it has decreased by 30 per cent
 'aniyamit coloniyon ke kaaran badi pareshanieke jain drenez system ke kamjor hone kii vajah bataate hue kehete hai, 'shahar ke kai dren bhar chuke hai
 Urbanization occurred, irregular colonies were formed and drainage was also ruined due to this
 drenejamen jo kachra ja rahaa he, usko saaf nahin kiya ja rahaa
 Drain of Wazirabad and Noida falls in Yamuna river
 uske aasapaas 30 fisadi ilaake main nirmaan ho chukaa he
 Many colonies have been formed
 chaahe akshardham ho, milinium depo ho yaa dilli sachivalay
 This sudden construction has reduced the drainage capacity of Yamuna river
 'plan bana, lekin kaam nahin huapichley dashak main gudgaanv, noida, or dilli main itani teji se vikaas hua he ki sarkaar or agenciyaan shahar kaa drenez system plan karnaa hi bhul gayi
 AK Jain says, 'no plan has been prepared to strengthen the drainage system
 aise main central plan banane kii jarurat he
 One such plan was made 10 years ago, but it did not work
 'ucchstareey cameti banane kii jaruratdilli main trephic or drenez ko control karne ke liye ring road bane, jisamen kondli-manesar-palaval or faridabad-noida-gudgaanv ke bich ek rasta bananaa chahie
 But the government put it on hold
 jain bataate hai ki dilli main property vailu bad gai he
 Because of this, dealers keep an eye on the vacant land
 yah bhi ek vajah he ki dilli ke yamuna belt main aniyamit coloniyon kaa nirmaan bad gaya he
 Jain suggested that a Municipal Corporation in Delhi, a High Power Committee should be formed between the DDA and the Delhi Government to work on the drainage system
 600 water body thim, ab sirf 150 bachi hantown planar ke mutabik, dilli danger jone main he
 He says that there used to be 600 water bodies in Delhi, which is now 150

 ) The politics regarding surgical strikes has intensified
 congress ke daawey par piem narendra modi ne tanj ksaa he
 Addressing the rally in Sikar, Rajasthan, PM Modi said that Congress can do surgical strikes in paper sitting in AC rooms
 pehle unhone kaha ki hamane 3 baar sargical strike kii, kal kaha ki hamane 6 baar kii
 Now in a few days we will say that we strike everyday
 piem modi ne kaha ki kal congress ke ek varisht netaa ne bayaan diya ki hamaare samay bhi kai baar sargical strike hui
 Now the Congress is somehow trying to prove that we did an air strike
 congressi ab sargical strike kii taarikh bhi saamne laae hai
 What kind of strike was this, about which the terrorists do not know, the strike holders do not know anything, Pakistan does not know anything nor the people of the country know anything
 congress par tanj kasate hue piem modi ne kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki congress main aise log he jo umr ke kisi bhi padaav main video game khelte rahete hai or shaayad sargical strike ko bhi video game samajhakar anand lete honge
 The Chief Minister of the government which is running the Congress in Karnataka, said that those people in the army who do not have food for 2 times, die of hunger, go to the army to feed
 ye hamaare vir beton or unki maataaon kaa apmaan he yaa nahin?sikar main piem modi ne kaha ki sena or hamaare shaheedon ke prati congress kaa bartaav hameshaa aisa hi rahaa he
 There was a Congress government for so many years, but they did not get the National War Memorial built
 aazaadee ke 7 dashak baad rashtriya war memorial banavaane kaa saubhaahgya aapke is chaukeedaar ko mila
 It is the same Congress party that used to hang soldiers for one rank and one pension for four decades
 or jab modi ne purv sainikon ke bich kah diya ki ham ye karke rahenge to sainikon ke ankhon main dhul jhonkne ke liye kah diya ki hamane lagu kar diya
 PM Modi said that Congress has never had respect for those who protect the country
 isliye congress ne kabhi unke hiton ke bare main nahin sochaa
 The Congress' claw is always in the clutter of cream
 jahaan malai nahin, vahaan congress kabhi gai nahin
 This is also one of the reasons that inflation starts touching the sky as soon as the Congress comes
 yani- congress ai, mahangaai laai

 On the 24th of October, 40 km south of Delhi, the capital of the country, there were fewer villagers and more policemen in Sunped village of Haryana
 jahaan-tahaan police kii gadiyaan khadi thim
 The main road cuts this village with a population of about two thousand
 dayee gali ke pakk makaan main daakhil hote hi dhuen se kaali ho gai diwaar or darwaja najar aata he
 This is evidence of the burning of humanity in this house on the night of 19-20 October
 us raat, jab log bhagwati jaagran ke kaarykram main mashgool the, kathith taur par rajput samudaay ke kuch logon ne police suraksha vaale dalit jitendra ke makaan kii charadivari fandakar us kamare main aag laga di, jisamen ve apni patni or do bacchon ke saath soe hue the
 In it, one year of innocent Divya and two years of splendor died while Jitendra's wife Rekha is admitted in a critical condition at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi
 is ghatana ne desh ko aisa jhakzora ki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se lekar haryana ke mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ko bhi peedit parivaar se milane aana padaa
 After all-round pressure, a CBI inquiry into the matter has been recommended
 sunped kii is dardanaak ghatana ko abhi do din bhi nahin hue the ki 22 aktubar ko pradesh ke gohana main 14 saal ke dalit ladke govinda ko kathith taur par police castady main maar diya gaya
 Later two sub-inspectors of the local police station were booked
 lekin hisar ke bhagana se lekar sunped or gohana kii ghatnaon ne 'ek varsh-sarvatra harsh' vaali sarkaar kii pole khol kar rakh di he
 Battle of Pradhani or something? Before going ahead, also know how far the roots of Sunpeed scandal go
 darasal, sunped kii sarpanchi pehle aaropee rajput balavant ke parivaar ke paas thi, lekin 2010 main seat daliton ke liye surakshit ho jane ke baad jitendra ke chachaa jagamaal gaanv ke sarpanch bane
 The financial condition of both the families is fine
 2014 main donon pariwaron main vivaad hua or is ghatana main rajput parivaar ke teen logon kii hatya kar di gai
 Nine people of Jitendra's family are still in jail on the charge of murder
 is hatyakand ke baad jitendra ke parijan badale kii karrwai ke bhay se gaanv chhodkar chale gaye the
 Jitendra's family returned to the village one and a half months ago and after that the incident took place
 haalanki jitendra ke chachere bhai vijay 2014 ke hatyakand kii vajah kuch is tarah bataate hai, ''rajput yuvak na keval dalit mahilaon ke saath chhedkhani kar rahe the, balki apana phone naalee main gir jane par jatisuchak tippanee karte hue ek dalit yuvak se jabaran naalee se phone nikalava rahe the
 "he says his family was not involved in the 2014 murder
 jitendra kaa aarope he ki waapas lautne se rajput unhen lagaataar dhamkee de rahe the
 At the same time, Balwant's family categorically denies, "we have no hand in this arson
" ham to khud peedit hai, hamaare log maare gaye hai
 "bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader and local MLA Tek Chand Sharma says," This incident is extremely shameful
 lekin ise jatigat chashme se nahin dekha janaa chahie
 Both families have enmity for 10-15 years
 " prashasan bhi ise paariwarik ranjish kaa maamla bataa rahaa he
 But apart from the rivalry, the reality and roots of the matter are hidden in the social fabric which, while living in the state, sometimes erupts in the form of dalit-jat and sometimes Dalit and forward caste fighting
 faridabad jile ke bispi karyaalay sachiv camel dutt gautam kehete hai, ''darasal, daliton ke paas jameen-sansaadhan nahin hai
 Most of the alleged upper castes work here or work in nearby companies
 ve chupchaap rahen to thik lekin jyon hi ve unke atyaacharon kaa pratirodh karte hai yaa is kuwwat main aate hai, oonchi jatiyon kii ore se riection hota he
 "this process of resistance is seen from Bhagana to Sunped
 bhagana main daliton kii jameen par jaaton ke kabje kaa maamla ho yaa dalit ladakiyon ke saath kathith balaatkaar, daliton ne sthaneey str se lekar dilli tak pradarshan kiya he
 Haryana is not the only such victim of oppression against the national shame
 rajasthan ke nagaur jile ke dangavas main isi saal 14 may ko jat samudaay ke logon ne ek dalit kii jameen par kabje ke vivaad ko lekar daliton ko tractor se kuchal diya
 The story of the capture of the upper castes by the connivance of the police on land reserved for Dalits in areas such as Sangrur in Punjab is also not old
 enciarabi ke mutabik, aise aparaadhon main 2013 ke mukaable 2014 main rashtriya str par 19 fisadi kii vruddhi hui he
 Andhra Pradesh and Telangana share the maximum growth, while Haryana is second and Madhya Pradesh third in terms of growth
 aisi ghatnaon kii sankhya ke maamle main uttar pradesh awwal he to uske baad rajasthan or chunavi maahaul main duba bihar he

 K
 singh ne vivaadaaspad tippanee karte hue kaha ki agar koi kute ko bhi pathar se maar de to kya uske liye sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya jayega
 Those who demanded his sacking on this statement ranged from Arvind Kejriwal to bjp's Jitan Ram Manjhi himself
 bihar ke siem nitish kumaar ne to rajya main vidhansabha ke chauthe daur ke prachaar ke maddenjar mujffarpur main kaha, ''bihar main jangalraj kaa naam lekar daraane vaali bijepi bataae ki kya haryana main dalit bacchon ko jalaayaa janaa hi mangalraj he?" lekin ve chunaav se kareeb do maah pehle apane pradesh ke khagadiya main dalit basti par bhoomihaar samudaay ke hamale par chuppi saadhe rahe
 At the same time, the acquittal of accused of horrific Dalit massacres one by one in the state also does not become an issue
 bihar main daliton ke vot ko apane paale main karne kii purajor koshish main jute pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi bijepi shasit haryana ke sunped cond par ab tak kuch kaha nahin he
 The party's national vice-president Rajaram, who arrived at Sunped on the instructions of BSP chief Mayawati, spoke of the party's struggle against Dalit atrocities in Haryana
 lekin sthaneey daliton ne sthaneey bispi vidhayak par hi ungali uthaate hue kaha, ''tech chand sharma daliton ke vot kii badaulat hi yahaan se jite or ve hi ab daliton kii bajaae prashasan or bijepi sarkaar ke saath khadey najar aa rahe hai
 "rajaram too confessed this fact to everyone and assured of action
 to kya daliton kii ahmiyat sirf unke vot hasil karne tak rah gai he?insaaf kii dhundhlee asabhagana maamle main insaaf na milane par daliton ne dharm parivartan kaa rasta chunaa, to bihar main dalit narsanhaaron ke aaropee saboot ke abhaav main chhutate ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, there is no doubt that the hope of getting justice for Dalits seems blurred
 prashasan kaa daaman bhi paak-saaf nahin dikhataa
 Even though seven accused have been arrested in the Sunpeed case, Jitendra's family fears that the police may not implicate him in the case
 haalanki haryana ke dijipi yashpal kehete hai, ''is maamle kii sibiai jaanch kii sifarish kar di gai he, so isaki jaanch par hamaara kuch kahana uchit nahin he
 "but when asked about the 68% increase in crime against Dalits in Haryana, they doubt the NCRB figures
 vahiin sunped or gohana ke baad ab hisar main ek dalit ne police par jyaadati kaa aarope laga aatmahatya kar lee he
 So, by handing over a case to the CBI, will the government be able to handle these explosive situations that keep erupting from the volcanoes of social equality? Incidents of Dalit atrocities have happened in every government, in most cases they have also received compensation, but when will justice be received?

 Shiv Sena breaks from BJP 30-year-old alliance could not form government despite separating from NDA Shiv Sena Uddhav himself spoke to Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar on October 24, when the results of the Maharashtra assembly elections came, 'once again bjp-shiv Sena coalition government' Discussed lekin nateezon kii shaam hi shivasena ne aankh tarerani shuru kar di
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray made his intentions at the press conference stating that the post of Chief Minister was very important
 iske baad shivasena kii taraf se 50-50 formule kaa hawala dete hue nirantar bayaanbaji hoti rahi
 Seeing this attitude of the Shiv Sena, the BJP also bluntly said that there was no CM post in the formula that was decided
 devendra fadanvis kaa yah bayaan shivasena ko itnaa chubha ki aaj maharashtra main rajyapal shashan kii naubat aa gai he
 In this entire struggle, the Shiv Sena kept claiming to be its chief minister, but also got trapped day by day
 shivasena pehle apni sahyogi bijepi ko chetati rahi or mukhyamantri pad dhai-dhai saal baantne kii aawaaj uthaati rahi
 If the BJP did not agree on this, Shiv Sena turned the whole politics by mentioning other options
 shivasena netaa sanjay raut saarvajanik taur par kehane lage ki unke paas 170 vidhayakon kaa samarthan he
 The support of the NCP and Congress also began to come forward openly on behalf of the Shiv Sena
 haalanki, is puure siyaasi drame main shivasena kii taraf se ensipi or congress se koi aupchaarik baatcheet dekhne ko nahin mili
 But Shiv Sena kept showing its attitude
 iskaa nateeja ye hua ki bijepi akele pad gai
 Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, being the largest party, offered the government to the BJP, after which on Sunday (november 10) evening, the BJP informed the Governor that it was not able to form the government on its own and that it had someone else Not supported
 bijepi ke inkaar ke baad rajyapal ne usee din shivasena ko ofer diya or 24 ghante ke andar sarkaar kaa daawa pesh karne ke liye kaha
 Shiv Sena needed the support of NCP and Congress to fulfill this offer
 lihaaja, baatcheet or charchaaon kaa daur shuru hua
 The NCP has stipulated that the Shiv Sena will consider support if it is out of the NDA
 shivasena ne ensipi kii yah shart maan lee or agali subah yani 11 november ko modi cabinet main apane iklaute mantri arvind saavant kaa istipha kara diya
 The minister was removed from the NDA, but still did not get support
 On November 11, Arvind Sawant resigned on the one hand, on the other side, the Congress and NCP meetings in Mumbai started
 der shaam tak baithken chalati raheen, lekin koi nateeja nahin nikal paaya or shivasena apana daawa pesh nahin kar saki, jiske baad rajyapal ne ensipi ko sarkaar kaa ofer de diya
 The NCP also started demanding time from the Governor instead of giving a letter of support, after which President's rule came into force on the recommendation of the Governor
 30 saalaa purana rishta tutaa, vichaardhaara se samjhautis puri siyaasi khinchataan main ek taraf shivasena ko apane 30 saal puraane rishte ko khatm karnaa padaa he
 On the other hand, it has had to come forward to cooperate with the anti-ideology Congress and NCP
 uddhav thakare ne khud sonia gandhi ko phone kar baat kii he or samarthan maanga
 Thackeray also held a meeting with NCP chief Sharad Pawar
 ye donon hi ghatnaayen shivasena ke siyaasi itihaas main behad alag raheen, lekin damege control ke liye uddhav thakare ko aisa karnaa padaa
 a stake in government is also a big challenge for the Shiv Sena, which has reached an agreement on ideology
 ensipi kheme se khabar he ki vah shivasena ke saath siem pad dhai-dhai saal baantnaa chaahati he
 Simultaneously, information about the deputy CM and speaker of the Congress has also been revealed
 iske alaava sutron kaa ye bhi kahana he ki congress cabinet main teenon dalon ke liye baraabar hissedari or mahatvapurn mantralayon kaa bhi samaan bantwaaraa chaahati he
 The Shiv Sena, which has left the BJP, needs to be with the congress-ncp to fulfill its desire to be its party's chief minister
 ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki congress or ensipi kin sharton ke saath shivasena ko samarthan detii hai or uddhav thakare kis had tak samjhauta kar pate hai

 chidambaram kii jamaanat yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan kapil sibbal ne hoicourt main kaha ki castady ke dauraan bhi sibiai ko koi aisa document nahin mila jisase ye sabit ho ki ye bhrashtachar kaa maamla he
 Chidambaram's lawyer and senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal told the court, "the CBI is arguing that Chidambaram can flee abroad, where is Chidambaram running away?" Nor can any evidence be destroyed
 abhi tak to nahin kiya
 How can it affect the LR sent to other countries? ”sibal told the court, according to the CBI that if the case is based on the document, then show it in a closed envelope to the document court to prove that Chidambaram has committed the crime
 sibbal ne kaha, chidambaram ek saansad hai or faraar hone kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Nor is there a case of tampering with evidence as the entire case is based on the document
 varisht adhivaktaa kapil sibbal ne kaha, philhal chidambaram nyaayik hiraasat main hai or ab sibiai ko unase poochtacha karnaa nahin he

 Only the Revenue Department objected to the name of Trity Shopping
 isaki manjuuri dene main 6 secretary bhi shaamil the lekin sirf chidambaram hi jail main hai
 Sibal further said, foreign investment came to India, money was invested in INX Media, there was no loss of money of the country and the public, so what went wrong? Chidambaram remained in CBI custody for 15 days and is now in jail for 18 days

 Narendra Modi has prepared for his third consecutive victory in the Gujarat assembly elections, the results of which are to come by the end of this month
 ve 2014 main hone vaale aam chunaavon main bijepi se pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par bhi khud ko pesh kar rahe hai
 But in the minds of secular Indians, Gujarat 2002 is a disastrous shock to democratic politics
 modi cabinet main mantri rahi maaya kodenani ko naroda paatia narsanhaar maamle main mili sajaa ne modi ke is daawey ko jhuthla diya he ki 2002 main gujarat ke musalamaanon par hue atyaachaar main sarkaar kaa haath nahin tha
 The judgment in the Naroda Patiya case has revived the old wounds of why, how and when Mahatma Gandhi's Gujarat was transformed into a theater of religious politics, communal divisions and premeditated violence? Gandhi in the first half of the 20th century The definition of his political philosophy was given by the word Ahimsa
 aaj hamen aisa lagata he ki ahimsa gandhi kaa diya hua darshan he, lekin bhartiya dharmik or darshanik vichaar parampara main, khaskar jain or buddha darshan main yah do sahasrabdiyon se maujuud rahaa he
 Due to the significant presence of Jains in the elite society of Gujarat, Gandhi was interviewed at a young age from non-violence
 ahimsa kaa shabdic arth he, ‘‘dusron ko chot pahunchane kii ichha kaa na hona
 Taking the leadership of India's freedom struggle, he made the principle of non-violence in Jain philosophy a part of popular politics
 gandhi ke liye bharat kaa rajnatik lakshya tha swaraj praapt karnaa, jo na sirf videshi raaj se mukti kaa paryaay tha balki dusron ko nuksaan pahunchane kii ichha se bhi mukti yani apane bheetar kii hinsak pravritiyon par bhi kaabo rakhana tha
 Non-violence and Swaraj were uncontested in the Gandhian struggle
 iskaa arth tha ki ahimsa ke bagaiyr na to nijee or na hi rashtriya str par sachhee aazaadee praapt kii ja sakati he
 The violent partition of India in August 1947, destroyed Gandhi's efforts for a non-violent nationalist movement
 bamushkil chah maah baad unhen hindu kattarpanthi godse ne goli maar di
 Godse represented many Indians who believed that no one would discuss irrelevant things like non-violence if Gandhi was not there
 un logon kaa maananaa tha ki uttar aupniveshik bhavishya main ahimsa ek nae raashtra ke hinsak tareekon se pravesh kii raah main baadha thi
 After this cruel turn of history, it was Gandhi's own land that first turned his eyes away from him and forgot to move on
 aaj gujarat kaa pratik gandhi nahin modi hai, jo prashasan or vikaas ke liye ek jaruri aujaar ke taur par puri besharmi se hinsa ko uske shabdic arth or bhaavana main lagu karne ke prati katibaddh hai
 Actually, it is not just a matter of violence here, but the intention of dominating the weak, showing their position to the minorities and establishing Hindu dominance which makes Modi's politics anti-gandhian
 gujarat ke musalamaanon ke liye 2002 ke vasant main modi kaa prashasan sangrakshan kii bajaae khatre kaa strot ban gaya tha
 In the context of communal violence since colonial times, the word which has been used to free the government from blame and responsibility is "communal riot"! The premeditated massacre of minority communities has been propagated as spontaneous riots with the help of law enforcement officials from Delhi 1984, Bombay 1992-93 and Gujarat 2002
 gandhi ne jab ahimsa kii baat kii thi, to ve apane anuyaayiyon ko hinsak pravriti chhod dene kii shiksha de rahe the
 He was preaching to the people to be restrained in their "riotous" tendencies against the coercion of the British government
 iske ulat hamaare netaaon ne lagaataar sulagati rajnatik jameen ke neeche lava kii tarah dabi hinsak pravriti ko bhadakaane kaa kaam kiya he
 After Indira Gandhi's assassination, in November 1984, around 3,000 Sikhs were killed, with Rajiv Gandhi saying it was "inevitable" when the big tree falls, the earth shakes
 ’’ gujarat 2002 par mukhyamantri modi ne newton ke tisare siddhant ke tarj par saamaajik kuparibhaasha gadhate hue shkriyaay or ‘‘pratikriya’’ kaa siddhant de daalaa
 It seems that the institutions of the state, political parties and civil society are situated in a circle, and sometimes on occasions that cannot be said in advance, but they are not completely redundant — that circle An explosion of unimaginable violence erupts at the center of it
 mahatma gandhi ne ashanka jataai thi ki saamaajik shrunkhalaaon or vaiyaktik chetana ke kenrdra main prerak pravriti ke taur par hinsa hi hoti he
 Private sovereignty, therefore, means overcoming this primitive tendency
 sachcha swaraj kisi samprabhu rajya ke hinsa par ekadhikaar main nihit nahin hota balki vyakti main hinsa kii ichha ko hi sire se khatm karne main nihit hota he
 There is also an active relationship between the modern state and hatred

 lekin aaj jab duniya ke anya mulk bhi isaki jad main hai to sabhi maanavtaavaadi shaktiyaan iske khilaaf ekajute hone ko taiyaar hai
 PM has appealed to all the countries of the world to come on a platform to end terror
 For over 4 decades, India has been raising the issue of terror
 Initially the world did not take us seriously but now the world is realizing the destructive aspects of terrorism: PM @ narendramodi # mannkibaatpic

 com / mpggafzrex — PMO India (@pmoindia) November 26, 2017 Remembering the contribution of the Navy, while speaking on Navy Day to be held on December 4, PM Modi said that civilizations have developed along the rivers
 unhone kaha ki navy ko yaad karte vakt maratha navy or shivaji maharaj kaa samaran bhi karnaa jaruri he
 The PM said that even at that time the Navy used to protect the sea border of the country
 bhartiya navy kii tarif karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki bharat hi nahin balki duniya ke anya mulkon main bhi hamaari navy alag-alag oparation chalaakar madad karti ai he
 Eid greetings to the countrymen: The Prime Minister congratulated the countrymen on the eid-e-milad greetings of the birthday of Prophet Mohammad

 This will inspire others: PM— PMO India (@pmoindia)november 26, 2017pradhanmantri ne shanivaar ko hi aam janata se suzav ke taur par sandesh bhi maang the
 He had requested the general public to participate as high as this time
 modi ne janata se narendra modi mobile ap ke jariye bhi apana sandesh saajha karne kii baat kahi
 Trending on twitter since last one week sarkaar ne 'i dil he mushkil' par pratibandh nahin lagaaya he
 The Cinema and Exhibitors Association of India has called for this boycott
 bollywood kii tamaam badi hastiyaan, khaskar aatmasantusht anuraag kashyap pratibandh or bahishkaar main itnaa ulajh gaye ki sarkaar par hi apni bhadaas nikaal daali, maano sarkaar ne hi pratibandh lagane kaa elaan kiya ho
 In the midst of this uproar, intolerance and 'freedom of expression' once again started a false debate
 yahi kaaran he ki aisa lag ja rahaa he ki'i dil he mushkil'kaa bahishkaar karnaa kattarta kaa pradarshan karne jaisaa he
 Some self-styled liberals are trying to paint it as such
 aisa samaaj jo guarantee ke saath vichaaron ke prachaar kii aazaadee detaa ho, vahaan koi naagarik yaa samooh ek film na dekhne kii apil kar saktaa he
 Such views are rationalized in a liberal democratic ethos
 saathi nagarikon se bahishkaar kii apil karne or sarkaar se pratibandh lagane kii prarthana karne ke bich kaa antar behad saral or spasht he
 Calling the government to ban is a democratic right, but asking a guardian state to allow fellow citizens to watch or not to watch a movie is unnecessary
 sarkaar dwaara apni marji se pratibandh lagaana puri tarah se alag or is sandarbh main asangat he
 Pakistan is fighting a war with India by staying straight and behind the scenes
 haal main uri sector main hue aatanki hamale ne puure raashtra kaa dhyaan kendrit kiya he
 In this year itself, India has lost 71 of its brave soldiers in the attacks in Jammu and Kashmir
 kai nagarikon kii jaane gayi, na jane kitne hi parivaar tabah ho gaye
 No citizen can deny that it is because of the soldiers who are protecting the country, they are living in a safe environment freely
 sarhad par tainaat javaanon se ekajutata dikhaane or dushman desh ko chunauti dene ke liye pratikaar ke rup main film ke bahishkaar kii apil karnaa galat nahin he
 (retaliation, though considered bad in itself, is one of the principles on which many legal drafts ranging from imprisonment to capital punishment have been drafted) An enemy country can be hated resulting in its own citizens Participatory in government functions is considered
 aisa karnaa un logon ke khilaaf ek swaabhaavik pratikriya he jo hamaari jindagi ko mushkil main daalate hai
 But, boycotting the film in which Pakistani actors worked because we hate the country is contrary to liberal principles
 ye bhi kahana galat nahin he ki aam pakistani bharat se jang nahin chahta he jaisi daleel 'aman kii aashaa' ke kaaryakartaaon ne bhi rakhi he
 This is a truth that has lost its morality because people with dubious credibility have started using this logic for their personal interests
 ye ek paheli hi he ki kaise bhartiya jo udaaravaadi sanathan dharm kaa anusaran karte hai, khud ko andhaa kar lete hai kala kii khubsuurati yaa kahen ki vaanijya ke dharmanirpeksh vairaygy se wo bhi mahaj isliye kyonki ye un logon dwaara mil rahaa he jo hamaare saath anukool nahin hai
 Is it unethical to appreciate the art of enemy country or the consumption of goods produced by them? It is impossible not to praise Wasim Akram's bowling or to lose it in the voice of Rahat Fateh Ali Khan
 yahi peedaadaayak satya bhi he
 Is abandoning art and knowledge merely because they are meeting opposition and not anti-talent? This religious dilemma is exactly the same as written in the Bhagavad Gita
 sawaal uthta he ki kya dushman ke liye nafrat se pare jaakar ek film kaa jisamen fawaad khan abhinay kar rahe hai saidhantik or sookshm virodh ho saktaa he
 If noticed, we will understand that this dispute is actually about liberalism versus nationalism
 or agar is tarah sawaal kiya jaae, to koi bhi ise kaale or safed kii tarah dekhegaa or ant main use hi chunegaa jo safed lagata ho (kyonki duusare hameshaa galat hote hai or kaale!)
 But the Venn diagram of 'liberal' and 'nationalist' is no different
 balki ye ek duusare se judaa hua he
 You can be a liberal nationalist
 deshprem or satya saath-saath chal sakate hai phir chaahe wo duniya ke kisi bhi kone se kyon na ho
 Especially in India where Sanatan Dharma gives us a variety of options to choose from
 tamil ke vidwaan dow
 Gnana Sundaram has recently said that 'not learning Hindi is not harmful for Hindi but it is for you
 ' isi prakaar kala or behatar utpaada kaa upyog na kar paanaa hamen keval garib banaata he
 To understand religiously why we should boycott and where does it fit in our moral world? Exclusion is the result of a final action and a thought process
 lekin hamaare vichaaron ke peeche kii niyat zyada mahatvapurn he
 Non-consequentialism from the Gita to Kant has given moral weight
 kaisaa ho agar yuddh ke samay ke dauraan ek sandesh bhejne kii vidhi ke rup main film kaa bahishkaar kiya jaae na ki isliye kyonki usamen dushman desh kaa kalakaar shaamil he
 If the boycott had been called in this manner, the argument could certainly be argued with greater moral validity
 ek naagarik apane saathi nagarikon se yuddhrat desh ke kuleen varg se laagat lagane kaa aagrah kar saktaa he
 Thus in theory a person can become tolerant and appreciative of knowledge but a prolonged exclusion of art would promote a liberal order
 bahishkaar ke parinaam mumkin he ki adhik kala ke liye sharton kaa nirmaan karen
 The boycott of products and cultural events would impose costs on the elite of enemy society
 agar kisi film,pakistan ke saath cricketya cement ke aayaat ko roka jayega to iskaa sidhaa asar kuleen varg yani kalakaaron or vyavsaaiyon par padegaa
 This will send the message that there will no longer be business as before
 wo vyapaaree varg jo raajnneetik partiyon ko funding karata he
 It will also have an impact on the ongoing trade with the Pakistani Army
 is tarah wo apane raajnneetik sangrakshakon ke saath lobing ke liye majaboor ho jaaenge or apane swaarth se baahar aakar aatankwaad ko rokane kii pairvi karenge
 This is a natural effort to make the world better
 ye richa chaddha jaise un tamaam logon ke tarkon kaa jawaab he jo poochhate hai ki 'kya filmein bain karne se aatankwaad khatm hoga
 What about Dharma Productions and all those like them? Is it appropriate for them to work with Pakistani artists in situations like Jung? Do they not consider themselves citizens of the first country? Or does he consider himself a 'creator' whose first duty is towards art? Can he be indifferent to the society which gives him the freedom and opportunity to pursue his art? Is what Robert Rae calls 'area of mutual responsibility' beyond that? In the midst of speculating about Bollywood, we should leave it to the discretion and morality of the actors
 manase dwaara di ja rahi dhamkee or dabaav hamaare ganatantr ko ek acha udhaaharan nahin bana rahaa
 If their works affect money loss or law and order in the country, then perhaps a law can be prepared for this problem keeping in mind the freedom of artists
 (is samay yah jaan lenaa bhi jaruri he ki purna swatantraaa ek bhram he
 The social contract theory of Thomas Hobbes, Loco and Rousseau teach us that in order to live peacefully in society a little freedom has to be traded) a moral project is imposed on every generation by their time and society
 hamaare samay main ye pariyojna rashtrawaad he
 As Gandhiji has said, 'we allow the winds to flow but do not allow ourselves to flow'
 hamaare desh or dharm ko bachaana jaruri he kyonki isamen duniya ko bahut kuch dene kii kshamta he
 This thinking can be strengthened only if our elite makes a short distance from politics and stands against the country ready to battle in front of us
 ek behtareen samaaj kaa nirmaan ek duusare par bharosa karke hi kiya ja saktaa he
 To find goodness in your enemy, one should not be too liberal
 yahaan tak ki prakhar rashtravaadi kavi subramanyam bharti ne bhi likhaa he ki 'he achche dil, dushman ko bhi dua de'
 Everyone has the right to advocate boycott on the basis of morality
 jhuthe udaarvaadiyon kii mandali ko keval kattarta hi dikh sakati he chunki udaartaa ke siddhant sahi arthon main bahishkaar ke virodh se maharoom hai
 There is no need to fall to the level of those who hate India or who are terrorists of the art world (for whom Nana Patekar has dubbed 'fake people')
 vakt aa gaya he unhe aaina dikhaane kaa, udaartaa or abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke prati unki ashishnutaa ko benakaab karne kaa

 madhyapradesh kii bhaajapa sarkaar par bhrashtachar ko lekar gambhir nahin hone kaa aarope lagaate hue singh ne kaha ki yadi bhaajapa sarkaar bhrashtachar ko lekar gambhir hoti to vah lokayukta dwaara mantriyon or adhikariyon ke khilaaf jaanch puri ho jane ke baad maangi gayi abhiyojan kii sweekruti de detii

 Q
 In response to a question about the announcement by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan about the silent protest at Rajghat in Delhi due to the non-approval of the Special Court Bill, Singh said that corruption will not be eliminated in the state by enacting another law
 
 unhone kaha ki pradesh main aise bahut se kanoon hai jinase bhrashtachar par ankush lagaaya ja saktaa he lekin rajya sarkaar main bhrashtachar ko kam karne ke prati ichha shakti kaa abhaav he
 It is noteworthy that after the Central Government sent the bill to the President for approval, the Chief Minister canceled his silence

 He said that if there is a shortage of fertilizer, the state government did not demand it in time
 unhone khaad kii kami ke liye rajya sarkaar kii vitaran vyavastha ko jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha ki socytiyon main khaad uplabdh nahin he, lekin kalabazar main paryaapt maatra main khaad uplabdh he
 Singh said that the state government continues to cry out the shortage of coal as much as coal
 pra ko aavantit kiya gaya tha uskaa vah upyog hi nahin kar paayi
 He said that no electricity was produced as much coal was allocated
 ek prashn ke uttar main singh ne kaha ki yojanaayen kitni bhi acchhee hon lekin yadi unka kriyanvayan hi thik nahin ho, to kuch nahin ho saktaa he
 In response to another question, Singh said that BJP repeatedly claims good governance but if there is good governance then why is the law and order situation deteriorating in the state and the graph of crime is increasing
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav kaa zikr karte hue singh ne bataaya ki unhen mirzapur or sonbhadra jile kaa prabhaar diya gaya he or ve aagaamee paanch farvari se 15 farvari tak vahiin rahenge
 Meanwhile, he will definitely come to Bhopal for a day to attend the meeting of the Congress Legislature Party
 unhone kaha ki uttar pradesh main ho rahe vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar pradesh congress cameti kii baithak main un netaaon ko vahaan jane ke nirdesh diye hai jo uttar pradesh kii seemaa se lage kshetron main karyrat hai
 Among these leaders are Bisahulal Singh, Yadavindra Singh, Indjit Kumar, Sundarlal Tiwari etc
 saamaajik kaaryakarta swami agnivesh ne kaha ki kendra sarkaar oparation green hunt kaa paisa vikaas par lagaae or aam logon kii samasya kaa hal karne ko taiyaar ho to maovadiyon ko baatcheet ke teble par vah laaenge
 Swami Agnivesh, who came here on a day-long visit to comfort the poor during the uproar after the encroachment removal campaign in Jharkhand, addressed the displaced at the Moharbadi Maidan, saying, the central government's money spent in the fight against Maoists is spent on development works If we do and stop the operation green hunt, then i will bring the Maoists to the negotiating table
 agnivesh ne kaha ki maovadiyon se baatcheet kar desh main naksal samasya kaa samaadhaan kiya janaa chahie apane hi logon se sangharsh kaa koi myne nahin he
 Earlier, he alleged that the state government of Jharkhand was not making any arrangement for the rehabilitation of lakhs of poor people in the encroachment removal program, against which he would launch a national movement and also knock the door of the Supreme Court if needed
 team india worldcup jeetne ke mishan par england main he
 The first two matches have also been won brilliantly but the wait is on 16 June
 jab bharat or pakistan ke bich muqabla hona he
 Ahead of the match, Star Sports has created an advertisement, in which it was not directly correct but twisted and described India as the 'father' of the Pakistan team
 aid main pita-putr kaa zikr isliye he kyonki 16 june ko fadars de he
 Even though this advertisement is getting hits, there has been a fierce debate on social media
 naa sirf bahes chhidi he, balki donon deshon kii taraf se vigyaapan ek-duusare ke khilaaf istemaal ho rahe hai
 Actually, this advertisement is made on the same lines as in the previous World Cup
 wo vigyaapan kaaphi hit hua or logon ne khulkar share kiya
 Perhaps an attempt has been made to capitalize on this 'opportunity' once again
 nae vigyaapan main bhi vahi actor he jisane pakistani fain kii bhoomika nibhaai thi, bas is baar bangladesh or bharat vaale kirdaar badale hai
 Let us first tell you what is in the new advertisement
 hota yun he ki bangladesh (kirdaar) pakistan (kirdaar) ke paas aata he or phir kahata he ki bhaijan! mauka-mauka saatvin baar
 Then Pakistan responds that Abbu has said that those who try are not defeated and Hindustan sitting in front is saying when did i teach you? See advertisement here
 
 
 bas vivaad isi par chhidaa he, soshal media yugers likh rahe hai ki aakhir ham kisi desh ko apana betaa kaise kah sakate hai
 When the country has moved so much, we are becoming number one in everything, yet why do you think so little that my son and i are your father! @ starsportsindiastop doing these cheap advertisement of WC matches
 # shamestarsportsu r recent ad on # indvspakmatch is not kn good taste

 co / kkqn8di15c — quickfinger (@bandaymatram) June 9, 2019 But there is another section on social media that is going crazy about this advertisement
 logon ko ye video mauka-mauka hi lag rahaa he or unhen apana divaana bana rahaa he
 Cricket fans feel that like every World Cup, India will beat Pakistan this time and will prove to be the father of cricket
 jab star sports ke is vigyaapan par soshal media par bahes chhidi thi, tab pakistan ne bhi ek vigyaapan jari kiya
 It has mocked the Indian Air Force wing commander Abhinandan
 is vigyaapan par bhartiya naaraaz ho gaye hai
 However, in response, Pakistani players are also arguing that when India is referring to them as sons in their advertisements, then why is the issue of mocking greetings in Pakistani Aid becoming an issue
 Abhinandan again 🤣☕️that’s an interesting idea about pakistan-india match in@cricketworldcupbeing played on 16th June 🏏 # pakvsindia # Abhinandan # CWC19 # indiavspakpic

 shainanc (@shainanc) March 1, 2015 aapane ye to suna hoga ki shaadi ke baad do alag-alag jindagi ek ho jaati he
 Their happiness becomes one and their sorrows also become one, but do you know that after marriage one partner gets sick, the other too
 ek nae adhyayan ke mutabik, agar aap kisi kamjor shaks se shaadi karte hai to shaadi ke baad aapke bhi kamjor hone kii ashanka bad jaati he or agar aap kisi avsaad peedit se shaadi karte hai to aapke bhi depressant kaa shikaar hone ke chancej bad jate hai
 According to the study, a major reason for weakness and depression in the elderly is due to their spouse
 umradraj mahila yaa purush main kamajori jitani adhik hogi, utana ve avsaadagrast honge
 Also, the greater the depression, the greater the weakness
 jarnal of american gereatrics sosayadi main prakashit is adhyayan main shaadishuda logon par kamajori or avsaad ke prabhaav kaa vishleshan kiya gaya he
 The point to note is that older husbands are more depressed and vulnerable than younger husbands, but older wives are not as afflicted with younger wives
 haa lekin apekshaakrit kamjor jarur hoti hai
 In the case of couples, weakness and depression may be related to each other
 isse yah mana ja saktaa he ki couples main sakriyata badhaane, saamaajikta badhaane or aapasi sahyog badhaane par dhyaan diya janaa chahie

 Despite the controversy arising out of a letter from an angry promoter, it seems that Indigo co-promoter Rahul Bhatia is not going to be shaken by his stance
 is baat kii sambhaavna nahin dikh rahi ki vah airline ke niyantran main badlaav ko lekar sahamat honge jiske tahat unako chairman, siio or anya prabandhan adhikariyon ko namit karne kaa adhikaar mila hua he
 Meanwhile, there are reports that another co-founder of the company, Rakesh Gangwal, may be questioned by the board members
 airline ke do ko-founder rakesh gangwal or bhaatia ke bich takaraav 8 june ko tab saamne aayaa jab gangwal ne arpiti or corporate niyantran ke muddon ko lekar bazaar viniamak SEBI (bhartiya pratibhuti evam vinimay board) ko patr likhaa
 News agency IANS quoted sources as saying that Bhatia was willing to get a government agency to check the balance seat of the company, because from the company's point of view there is no dearth in its functioning
 iconomic times ke mutabik, indigo board ke kuch sadsy company ke ko-founder rakesh gangwal se is bare main sawaal kar sakate hai ki aakhir unhone ingine banane vaali company prat and whitney (PW) ko ingine kaa order na dene kaa nirnay khud kyon liya or board se is bare me mashvira kyon nahin kiya
 Originally, all orders for Indigo's engine were received by PW, but recently a $ 20 billion order was given to its rival CFM
 ek agjicutive ne ieenes ko bataaya, 'sambandhit paksh hastantaran (arpiti) or corporate niyantran se jude mudde uthaae gaye hai
 On the pretext, a promoter wants a change in control, but Rahul Bhatia is not going to do so
 ' letters kii ek copy pradhanmantri narendra modi, vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman or sheersh str ke sarkari adhikariyon ko bheji gai he
 Gangwal and his family hold a 37 per cent stake in the company, while Bhatia and his family own a 38 per cent stake in the country's largest private sector airline company and about 50 per cent shares through the stock market
 gangwal ne apane patr main aarope lagaaya he ki company dwaara niyantran ke aadharbhoot niyamon kaa paalan nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 Also, he has questioned the RPT
 unhone kaha ki agar trutiyon ko dur nahin kiya gaya to iske durbhagyapurna anjaam dekhne ko milenge
 It is reported that Bhatia has an unusual right in Indigo under which he can appoint three out of six directors
 iske alaava vah emdi, siio va president kii niyukti kar sakate hai
 Gangwal alleges that these rights are not being used properly

 YEH SAB CHOR HAIN PAANCH SAAL PAISA KHAATE HAIN AUR JANTA KO LOOT LETE HAIN KAMINE KUTTE- PAPPU JIMADRAS
 SBK arvind kejariwal kaa mishan banaras aaj se shuru ho gaya he
 Kejriwal reached Banaras in the morning
 jahaan par aam aadmi party ke kaaryakartaaon ne unka joardaar swaagat kiya
 Kejriwal has reached Banaras for the second time but this time the stagnation is long, and the motive is purely political
 pehle daure main shahar ko pahachaanaa or abaki baar shahar ke logon kaa mizaaj parakhane kii koshish karne vaale hai
 That is why, starting today, during the tour of Varanasi, Kejriwal will first turn to the Dalit colony
 varanasi loksabhaa kshetra main kareeb 1 lakh dalit voter hai or kejariwal inkaa vot apane paksh main karne se bhala kyon gurej karen
 However, before Kashi traveled in Delhi, he said that he is going to Varanasi not to himself but to save the country
 varanasi main kejariwal kaa muqabla kisi or se nahin balki narendra modi se he or varanasi pahunchane se pehle bhartiya rail kii apni bogi se hi kejariwal ne logon se is sabase bade jang main saath judane kii apil kar daali
 He wrote on Twitter, 'I have left for varanasi-amethi
 mahakranti kaa aagaaj karne
 Please pray for the country
 aapaki duaon ne hameshaa karishma kiya he
 If there is time, then definitely come to Varanasi or Amethi
 'varanasi main chunaav 12 may ko he or 12 may tak kejariwal kaashi main hi deraa daale rahenge
 The plan of Kejriwal's Kashi fortification is completely ready
 kaaryakartaaon ke paas nirdeshon kii fehrist he jisaki raah par chalakar kejariwal apane mishan or makasad ko anjaam dena chaahate hai
 Take a look at Kejriwal's Kashi plan too
 kejariwal kaa 'plan kaashi'voting se pehle tak varanasi main kejariwal logon se choti-choti meeting karenge
 Apart from this, big rallies will also be held at intervals of few days
 kaashi ke logon se bhi kejariwal mulaakaat karenge or unke bich aam aadmi party kii niti or niyat to spasht karne vaale parche bhi baante jaaenge
 Kejriwal will also try to convince his opponents
 matadaataaon se jansanvaad ke liye sabha kaa bhi aayojan hoga jisame logon ke sawaal liye jaaenge or unke jawaab bhi kejariwal kii ore se die jaaenge
 If sources are to be believed, the Aam Aadmi Party has made a budget of 10 lakh rupees to directly communicate with 10 lakh voters out of the 16 lakh voters of Varanasi
 500 kaaryakartaaon kii ek puri team is kaam ko anjaam degi
 By the way, Kejriwal has already started putting this thing in his mind to caution the people of Kashi that if Modi also becomes the King of Kashi then the next day he will abandon him and walk on the road of Vadodara
 sthiti saaf he ki kaashi fatah karne ke liye kejariwal dal, dil or dimag kaa puraa istemaal kar rahe hai
 The effort is strong but it will be meaningful only when the people of Kashi accept it
 bhartiya janata party ke netaa shuruaati chah maheenon ke dauraan mukhyamantri pad kii daavedaari ke liye aapasi sirfutowwal karte rahenge, bagaiyr yah samajhe ki sarkaar banane ke liye sabase pehle jaruri he ki unke paas vidhayakon kii paryaapt sankhya
 In the second half of the year, it will be seen that the leaders will continue to get tickets to their maximum supporters, without deciding that the only criterion to get tickets should be their ability to win the election
 janvari main mukhyamantri pad ke swayambhu daavedaar bijepi ke gulabchand kataaria adivasee ilaakon main apni yatra nikaalenge taaki tikat dilwane ke liye apane samarthakon ke haath majboot kar saken
 After this, Vasundhara Raje will start her campaign campaign
 aresas puure maamle main anaavashyak dakhal dekar sabakaa khel bigaadpee main laga rahegaa
 The Sangh will give place to disagreements, but will not be ready to bear the responsibility of the loss caused by it
 saal ke duusare hisse main vasundhara raaje tak unke virodhiyon kii pahunch aasaan ho chuki hogi or unki samajhadaari main bhi ijapha hoga
 It will be a tough challenge for the Congress to win the next election
 lihaaja uske bheetar tikat ko lekar zyada maaramaari shaayad na ho
 Despite this c
 pi
 Joshi, Bhanwar Jitendra Singh and Sachin Pilot will try to get maximum number of tickets to their supporters and take the largest share
 apane samarthakon ko tikat dilwane ke liye mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ko sonia gandhi kii sharan main janaa pad saktaa he
 Seeing the national convention of the Congress in Jaipur, it is understood that the Congress is giving importance to the Assembly elections in Rajasthan
 gahalot kii puri koshish hogi ki adhiveshan ke dauraan na to unke virdohi or na media unke khilaaf kisi bhi khabar ko prachaarit-prasaarit kare
 During this time, any major criminal incident, disclosure of any scam or any disaster can damage their image
 rajya ke liye monsoon is baar nirnaayak sabit hoga
 If the rains are good, then some seats of Congress may be increased
 agar sookhaa padaa to sookhaa raahat ke naam par sattarudh congress or aalaa adhikariyon ko paise kaatane kaa mauka haath lag jayega
 This will strengthen the bjp's two important electoral issues: corruption and the failure of the Gehlot government
 gahalot ko raaje se jitna dar badhata jayega, ve apane hamalon main or tikhe hote jaaenge
 Since Gehlot has benefited many BJP leaders and thus kept his mouth shut on corruption cases, he would avoid a direct attack on Gehlot in response
 isaki bajaae ve raaje ko sakaaratmak bane rahane kii salaah denge
 However, Raje will disappoint these leaders by balancing a positive strategy for the state and a harmful strategy for Gehlot
 is saal bijepi netaa rajendra singh rathod kii raajnneetik kismat kaa faisla hona he, jinke upar daara singh kii hiraasat main hatya kaa aarope he
 This year the fate of the Jalmahal project, corrupt businessmen and leaders will also be decided, who have been involved in this mahaloot
 bhrashtachar ke kai or maamle saamne aane baaki hai, jinka khulaasa hua to bhi usamen bijepi ke netaaon kaa koi haath nahin hoga
 This time assembly elections are due in December and repeating the previous performance in 96 seats out of the last 200 will be more challenging for Gehlot than before
 haalanki bijepi agar apane ati-aatmavishvaas or aapasi foot main hi uljhi rahi to phir mudda yah hoga ki kya gahalot vaisaa hi pradarshan kar sakenge, jaisaa manmohan singh ne 2009 main kiya tha? bijepi agar jald-se-jald ek netaa vasundhara raaje kii chhatrachhaaya main rajasthan kendrit apni ranneeti banane main kaamyaab rahi, tabhi vah jeetne kii ummid kar sakati he
 Leaders like Kataria can be used to bring more and more seats to the party in their areas of influence
 band daravaajon main gahalot ke saath sajishein rachane waalon ko use baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya hoga
 Whether it is cricket or any other sport, mutual fighting of Congressmen will affect everyone and the performance of the state may remain worse
 isi ko dekhakar samajh main aata he ki congress rajasthan ke vidhansabha chunaav ko kitni ahmiyat de rahi he
 Tomorrow will be the last eclipse of the year on 10 December as a full lunar eclipse and this astronomical event can be seen across the country
 nehru taramandal kii nideshak en
 Ratnashree said that there will be a complete lunar eclipse tomorrow when the moon will be completely covered by the Earth's shadow
 chandragrahan tab hota he jab surya or chandramaa ke bich main prithvi aa jaati he or is tarah chand prithvi kii chaaya main chhip jaataa he
 This only happens when the Sun is in a straight line to the Earth and the Moon
 inter uniwarsity centre for estronaumi and estrophysics (aiusiee) ke aravind paranjape ne kaha ki jaade kii raat main ghatana kaa jabardast najaara dekhne kaa mauka milegaa
 The eclipse will be at its peak at eight o'clock in the night at one minute and 50 seconds
 yah shaam paanch bajkar do minute se shuru hoga or raat 11 bajkar do minute par khatm hoga
 The shadow phase will start at 6
15 pm and will last for 48 minutes at 9 pm
 purna charan kii shuruyaat shaam saat bajkar 36 minute par hogi or yah raat aath bajkar 28 minute par samaapt hoga
 Entire events can be seen from Asia and Australia
 science popularigeshan association of communicators and agucators (spes) ke sibi devgan ne kaha ki europe or africa ke paryvekshak grahan ke shuruaati charan nahin dekh paaenge kyonki ye chandramaa ke udit hone se pehle ghatit honge
 n Raghunandan Kumar of the Planetary Society of India said that this eclipse will be the longest eclipse till 2018
 unhone kaha ki is khagoleey ghatana ko dekhne ke liye bharat sarvaadhik upyukt sthanon main se ek he jahaan shuru se lekar aakhir tak grahan ko iske vibhinn charnon main dekha ja sakegaa
 According to Kumar, the opportunity to see the full lunar eclipse from the beginning to the end (various stages) for people in and around India will come on 27th, 28th July 2018

 shrikrishna kii sikhaai gai baaten yuvaaon ke liye is yug main bhi utani hi mahatvapurn hai, jitani arjuna ke liye raheen
 Know the essence of their practical knowledge, how to guarantee success even in today's competitive era
 1
 Krishna is rich in revolutionary ideas on every front
 unka sabase bada aakarshan yah he ki vah kisi bandhi-bandhai li par nahin chale
 He changed his role according to the need of the occasion and became Arjun's charioteer
 2
 Lord Krishna had proved that by supporting the Pandavas in every difficult time, friends are the only ones who support you in the most difficult situation
 dosti main sharton ke liye koi jagah nahin he, isliye aapako bhi aise hi dost apane aas-paas rakhane chahie jo har mushkil paristhiti main aapkaa sambal bane
 3
 mahabharat ke sabase bade yoddha arjuna ne naa keval apane guru se sikh liya balki vah apane anubhavon se hameshaa kuch na kuch sikhte rahe
 This learning is necessary for every student
 student ko shikshak ke alaava apni galatiyon or asafalataaon se bhi hameshaa siikhnaa chahie
 4
 agar pandavon ke paas bhagwaan krishna kii master stritji naa hoti to shaayad hi pandav yuddh main jeet pate
 Therefore, to prepare for any competitive exam, it is necessary to create a strategy
 5
 Don't worry, be happy
 is funda ko krishn ne gita main sikhaaya he
 'why do you worry in vain? Whom are you afraid of in vain? '6
 krishna se judi kisi bhi kahani ko padhein to aapako ye baat safataur par dekhne ko milegi ki insaan ko doordarshee hona chahie or use paristhiti kaa akalan karnaa aana chahie
 7
 krishna hamen yah bhi sikhaate hai ki musiibat ke samay yaa safalataa na milane par himmat nahin haarani chahie
 Instead, we should move forward knowing the reasons for the defeat
 samasyaon kaa saamana karen
 Once you overcome fear, then victory will be in your footsteps
 8
 The biggest guru of management is Lord Krishna
 unhone anushaasan main jeene, vyarth chintaa na karne or bhavishya kii bajaay vartmaan par dhyaan kendrit karne kaa mantra diya
 9
 bhagwaan krishna ne apane mitra sudama kii garibi dekhi to uske ghar panhuchane se pehle hi uski jhonpadi kii jagah mahal bana diya
 Therefore, it is said that friends should learn to do with Krishna and never take the position in relationships
 10
 It is not easy to get everything directly
 khaastaur par tab jab aapako virodhiyon kaa palada baari ho
 In this case, follow the path of diplomacy
 krishna ko sabase bada kootaneetajbhi mana jaataa he

 He said that the Pulwama terror attack was a conspiracy of the BJP, as was the Godhra incident
 ensipi netashankarsingh waghela (shankersinh Vaghela) ne kaha ki ''pulavama aatanki hamale main ardex le jane ke liye jis gaadi kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha, uskaa registration number gujarat kaa tha''
 He further said, 'godhra incident was also a BJP conspiracy'
 media se baat karte hue shankarasingh waghela (shankersinh Vaghela) ne kaha ki, ''bijepi chunaav jeetne ke liye aatankwaad kaa sahaara leti rahi he
 There have been many terrorist attacks in the last 5 years ''
 shankarasingh waghela (shankersinh Vaghela) yaheen nahin ruke
 He said, 'balakot Airstrike was a well thought out conspiracy by the BJP
 balakot hamale main koi bhi nahin maaraa gaya tha
 Even no international agency could prove that 200 people were killed in the air strike '
 waghela ne kaha, pulavama ko lekar khufia sutron se jaankaree milane ke baavjood koi kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 He targeted the BJP and said that if you had information about Balakot, then why not take action against these terrorist camps beforehand? Why were you waiting for something like Pulwama to happen? bijepi par tanj kasate hueshankarsingh waghela (shankersinh Vaghela) ne kaha, 'bijepi kaa gujarat model jhootha he

 The film 'force' is on the brave officers of Narcotic Control Bureau
 asipi yashvardhan yani jon abraham life main kabhi romance main nahin pade kyonki nashili dawaaon ke saudagaron ke saamne wo koi kamajori chhodana nahin chaahate
 But when Maya means Genelia d'souza's entry, this officer could not stop herself
 lekin halaat tab badal jate hai jab drug mafia chun-chun kar narcotic officers ke pariwaron se dushmani nikaalane lagata he
 Director Nishikant Kamat's 'force', which had earlier made films like 'mumbai Meri Jaan', is a remake of the Tamil film 'kaka Kaka'
 film ke kuch ection seens hatakar jarur hai khaskar jahaan jon bike uthaakar dushman ko de maarthe hai
 But many action sequences have failed to excite
 dheron seens dim lite main shoot kiye gaye isiilie bhi 'force' thodi dal lagati he
 i doubt that the fast pace complex dialogues between narcotic officers will be able to understand the common man for whom the action film 'force' is made
 salmaan or ajay devgan kii ection filmein apni siplicity ke kaaran single screens main chal jaati hai
 The most influential is Genelia d'souza in the chubbly and bold Maya role
 unke dialogs chehre par muskuraahat bikher denge
 Genelia tried hard to put chemistry with John in Love Story
 kaash 'gazani' kii tarah yahaan bhi lav story ko badhaayaa jaataa
 My rating for the average film 'force' is two and a half stars

 His brother-in-law, Abdul Rahman Makki, who took command of the jamaat-ud-dawa after the house arrest of Hafiz Saeed, mastermind of the Mumbai terror attack by the Pakistan government, is in awe of the willful serpent
 usne pakistani patrakaron se apil kii he ki ve kashmir se judi khabaron ko 25 minute yaa paanch minute yaa kam se kam teen minute tak apane channelon par jarur dikhaaen
 Aka Makki of terror said that we have 85 channels here
 us par ham apane culture ko dikhaaen
 He said that the culture was left behind and now the serpent drama is shown on the fucking channels
 usne kaha ki pakistani channelon main nagin naam kaa drama aata he
 That too is the drama of the willful serpent
 pehle saas bahu kaa drama chalata tha or ab nagin drama
 Makki asked 'well tell me what you are doing for Pakistan by looking at the drama of the wishful serpent
' aatanki makki ne kaha ki teen baje ladki khadi hokar ichhadhari nagin ban gai
 Now we are showing all this, which is all over within a drama
 ab ham kahaan ja kar kahen ki yahaan ke tivi channel kashmir ke liye teen se paanch minute den
 Makki said that the express channel used to say that every news is watched
 express ke liye hamaara betaa taiyaar hokar border paar karke kashmiriyon kii madad ke liye gaya or vahaan shahid ho gaya, lekin express par koi khabar nahin dikhi or agar gaadi ko jaraa si takkar lag jaae, to express kii nazar pad jaati he
 He said that neither a journalist nor a big dish (dish) can be seen for us
 aatanki ne kaha ki pakistan ke hukmran is laayak nahin hai ki unako hukmran kaha jaae
 He has imprisoned Hafiz Saeed
 makki ne kaha, 'main aapako bataanaa chaahunga or mujhe bataane main bhi koi pareshaani nahin he ki hafiz said ne janvari main hi elaan kar diya tha ki saal 2017 kashmir ke azaadi ke naam hoga, lekin jo khichdi pak rahi thi, vah 24 ghante ke andar hi utaar lee gai
 Hafiz Saeed was placed under house arrest

 There is no policy on Middle East, Central Asia and Kashmir
 isaki vajah yah he ki hamaara koi videsh mantri hi nahin he
 i swear by Allah that i am a man of the country who has no foreign policy, nor any foreign minister
 makki ne pakistani patrakaron ko uksaate hue kaha ki kashmir ke log pakistan kii ore nazre gaade hue hai
 He told the journalists to tell Asiya Andrabi, Duktrani Miltat, Mirwaiz that in the situation where they are standing there, we are not sitting here peacefully

 This incident which occurred in Delhi has shocked everyone
 maamla purvi dilli kaa he jahaan 22 saal ke yuvak kii laash railway trek par pai gai wo bhi 12 tukdon main
 The householders are directly accusing the young man's in-laws because he had married love
 darasal tilakanagar ke minakshi garden main rahane vaale 22 saal ke paras bhasin kii laash 12 tukdo main ganesh nagar railway treks se baraamad hui he
 The family members of Paras allege that their son has been slaughtered in the name of false pride
 gharavaalon ke mutabik paras ne isi saal may maheene main ek ladki se arya samaaj mandir main shaadi kii thi, jisaki baat ladki ne parijanon ko tab bataai jab wo uski shaadi kahin or karne lage
 The family members of Paras allege that since then the girl's housemates took the girl hostage in the house and threatened Paras to kill her daughter and even threatened to kill her
 paras ke parijanon kii maane to shanivaar ko ek anjaan nambar se phone karne vaale ne bataaya tha ki paras kii maut ho chuki he or uski laash ganesh nagar ke railway trek par padi he
 Hearing the news, the family immediately got scared and their senses flew away
 gharavaale paras kii maut ko qatl isliye qaraar de rahe hai kyonki paras kii maut kii khabar unhen police ne nahin di thi
 Rather it was given by some unknown person
 jabaki paras kii laash ke paas naa to uskaa wolet tha or naa hi mobile phone
 In such a situation, how did the unknown caller know that the paras is the one who dies
 itnaa hi nahin police ko paras kii laash ke paas se uske sir kaa hissaa bhi baraamad nahin hua tha
 However, in this case, the girl's mother says that they do not know anything about the marriage of both
 gharavaalon kaa ye bhi aarope he ki ladki ke gharavaale rasukhdaar hai isliye police maamle ko taalane kii koshish kar rahi he
 At the same time, police say that part of Paras's head has been recovered and after investigation so far, the police is considering it as a case of suicide
 or yahi vajah he ki police ne is maamle main ab tak hatya kaa maamla darj nahin kiya he
 At the same time, the police say that the matter is being investigated
 lekin paras ke parivaaravale is baat ade hai ki maamla darj hone par hi wo laash le jaaege
 It is obvious that the way Paras' corpse has been found, it is necessary to raise the question whether it is just an accident or Susaid or the thought of a planned conspiracy
