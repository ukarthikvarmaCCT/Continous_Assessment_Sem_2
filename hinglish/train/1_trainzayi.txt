 Mamta said that if it is appeasement, i will keep doing it till i am alive
 agar koi mere maathe par gan bhi rakh de tab bhi main yahi karuungi
 i do not discriminate against anyone
 ye bengal kii samskruti he, ye meri samskruti he
 Significantly, the BJP and right-wing organizations continue to accuse Mamata Banerjee of Muslim appeasement
 ye maamla tab or bad gaya jab mamata sarkaar ne 30 sitambar ko murti visarjan par roak laga di kyonki is din muharram bhi he
 Many people are calling it a violation of fundamental rights and now this matter is in court

 do ap – ek whatsap or doosraa petm
 The two face each other
 kuch dinon main sab badal gaya he or ab ye donon ap ek duusare ke pratidwandi ho gaye hai
 The reason is just one
 duniya kaa sabase zyada yuj kiya jane vaale miseging ap whatsap ne bharat main whatsapp Payment kii shuruyaat kar di he
 Before this, there was no collision between whatsapp and Paytm, as both were very different apps from each other
 ek taraf duniya kaa sabase zyada yuj kiya jane vaala instent miseging ap whatsap he jiske worldwide 1 arab se zyada yugers hai
 On the other hand, the Indian e-wallet is the Paytm app which is used the most here
 dimonetigeshan ke baad se petm ek nai oonchai par he or iske yugers main lagaataar ijapha ho rahaa he
 As soon as the whatsapp payment system was launched, Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma made a tweet that clearly shows how much damage has occurred in Paytm with the arrival of whatsapp
 vijay shekhar sharma ne pitiai se kaha he, 'ham barabari kaa bartaav chaahate hai
 There is no login password in whatsapp payment, there is a big security risk for two customers
 chunki abhi whatsap pement beta testing main he, phir bhi hamen nahin lagata ki baad me koi badlaav kiya jayega
 Vijay Shekhar Sharma told ET, "facebook is openly colonizing our payment system and customizing UPI for its own benefit
" UPI bharat ke liye bana he, ab kuch america ekadhikaarwaad vaali companiyaan UPI ko apane plateform par laane ke liye twist kar rahe hai
 'it is clear from these two statements that how there has been a stir in Paytm with the knock of whatsapp payment
 is halchal kii ek duusari vajah ye bhi ho sakati he, kyonki whatsap ko sarkaar se iske liye puraa sahyog miltaa dikh rahaa he
 NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant made a tweet in which he shared the payment screenshot from whatsapp and said that it is quite easy to pay through whatsapp
 aaie jaanate hai whatsapp or Paytm main antar kya he jab baat pement kii aati he
 Both have been supported by UPI
 whatsapp Paymentisa ap main company ne ek khaas pement opshan diya he jise aap whatsap ke settings main ja kar acces kar sakate hai
 The second option can be sent by clicking on attachments in the chat
 mobile number se bank acount link hona jaruri he or yahaan bhi UPI vaala hi process he
 Here your number will be verified by you
 yahaan bhi aapako UPI pin dena hoga
 After all this process, you can also send money by chatting to other contacts, but the person sending the money should also have a new version whatsapp and mobile number linked to the bank account
 whatsap par log in ke liye aapako password kii jarurat nahin hoti
 However, an advantage with whatsapp is that it runs on your number and no one other than you can access your whatsapp from anywhere
 whatsap ek baar main kisi ek divaais par hi chalata he
 Paytm opens a chat window to send money to someone through UPI, from here you select the UPI payment option
 yahaan bhi aapkaa number register hona chahie agar nahin he to opshan diya jayega
 The bank account has to be linked to the Bhima UPI section
 petm par aapako QR code kaa bhi opshan miltaa he or yahaan aap aadhaar number ke jariye bhi paise bhej sakate hai
 Some things are different in both apps, but the concept of transaction from UPI is the same
 kul mila kar donon main kamobesh opshan ek jaise hi hai
 Since the payment of whatsapp is in beta mode, it may happen that some new features can be given next
 aage muqabla or bhi tej hone kii ummid he

 The court said that it will not change the earlier order and if Kejriwal wishes it can challenge it in the upper court
 adaalat ne kejariwal se phir poocha ki unhen muchalaka bharne main kya pareshaani he jabaki yah sirf ek halafanama he

 'these are the words that Union Minister Smriti Irani wrote after defeating Congress President Rahul Gandhi in his own stronghold, Amethi
 amethi ke nattejey aane main bhale hi abhi deree ho lekin rahul ne live press conference main haar sweekaari
 After which came this reaction of memory
 aapako bataa den ki pichhali teen baar se rahul gandhi amethi se jeet rahe the, lekin is baar smriti ne unke kile main send laga di
 Let me tell you that Smriti Irani is leading in Amethi by 33 thousand votes
 smriti ko abhi tak 286504 to vahiin rahul gandhi ko 253503 vot mili hai
 Significantly, this will happen after a long time when a member of the Gandhi family from Amethi will lose the election
 rahul gandhi bhi 2004, 2009 or 2014 main amethi se lagaataar jeet darj kar chuke hai
 Who says there is no hole in the sky 
 
 — Smriti z Irani (@smritiirani)may 23, 20192014 main smriti irani amethi se chunaav ladi thim, lekin unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Despite this, Smriti did not stop chasing Amethi and continued to visit there
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki is baar vahaan par ladaai dilachasp thi, jisamen smriti ne baaji maar lee he
 In fact, when Rahul Gandhi came to hold his press conference on Thursday evening, he congratulated Narendra Modi
 or saath hi amethi par bayaan de diya
 Rahul had said, 'today Smriti ji lives in Amethi, i congratulate her'
 aapako bataa den ki amethi wo seat he jahaan par gandhi parivaar ke diggaj chunaav lard chuke hai or jeet chuke hai
 Sanjay Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi have contested and won this seat before Rahul Gandhi
 sanjay gandhi kii maut ke baad unki patni menka gandhi bhi is seat se chunaav ladi thim, lekin rajeev gandhi ke mukaable unhen haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The Congress, which was stuck in the results of the Rajasthan Assembly Elections 99, won the Ramgarh Assembly on Thursday with a score of 100
 isi ke saath congress party 200 sadasyon vaali rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav main spasht bahumat se mahaj 1 kadam dur rah gai he

 vahiin, bispi ne purv videsh mantri natwar singh ke putr jagat singh ko maidan main utarkar muqabla dilachasp bana diya tha
 Safia Khan, who contested on the Congress ticket, defeated her nearest rival bjp's Sukhwant Singh by 12228 votes
 vahiin, bispi ummidavaar jagat singh tisare sthaan par rahe
 Safia Khan got 83,311 votes from Congress and Sukhwant Singh 71,083 votes from BJP
 ramgarh vidhansabha chunaav pratyaashiyon ke alaava chunavi maidan main utre dalon ke liye zyada ahm tha
 Especially for the BSP, this seat was important because in the recent assembly elections, the BSP emerged as a big factor in the 6 assemblies here

 saamaajik kaaryakarta akhtar chaahate hai ki pakistan kii sansad main bhi bharat kii tarah hi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ek vidheyak pesh kiya jaae
 Akhtar, who monitors the movement against corruption in India, said, “I demand that a bill against corruption be introduced in the National Assembly
 " unhone kaha ki pakistan main bhi vaisaa hi vidheyak pesh kiya janaa chahie jaisaa bharat main ho rahaa he
 Akhtar told in a special conversation with IANS over phone from Islamabad, “pakistan has more corruption than India
 
 very much

 He recalls, "I once sat on a 22-day hunger strike in Islamabad to demand traders
 " iske baad vah ek baar phir aath dinon ke liye hadtaal par baithe the
 Akhtar says that his family does not interfere in it
 unhone kaha ki bhukh hadtaal ko lekar vah sankalpit hai
 Apart from corruption, Akhtar also wants to raise another issue and the issue is that Pakistan is continuously increasing its defense budget because it has spread the illusion that Pakistan's stability is threatened due to India

 During campus elections no approval was taken regarding this action, so this activity was banned

 sahaara samooh or birla samooh kii diariyon main pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa naam shaamil hone ke maamle se judi sunwaayee se varisht nyaayadhish jees khehar ne khud ko alag kar liya he
 Apart from this, while hearing the case, the court once again asked senior advocate Prashant Bhushan to come up with convincing evidence
 darasal, varisht vakil prashanth bhushan ne ise rishwatakhori kaa maamla bataate hue ucchtam nyaayalay main pradhanmantri ke khilaaf maamla daayar kiya tha
 The matter was heard on Friday
 adaalat ne prashanth bhushan dwaara pesh kiye sabooton ko naakaafi maanate hue unase thos saboot pesh karne ko kaha
 The court said that these allegations are serious and against those in high constitutional positions
 chunki desh ke pradhanmantri par aarope lagaae ja rahe hai or pradhanmantri par yun hi aarope nahin lagaae ja sakate, agar pukhta saboot hon to maamle kii aage sunwaayee karenge
 The court told Prashant Bhushan that if he continues to make similar allegations, it will become difficult for the constitutional authority to act
 adaalat ne kaha, 'hamane pehle bhi kaha tha ki is maamle main koi saboot denge, to hi sunwaayee karenge
 At the same time, the court also objected to the demand of giving more time to Prashant for evidence
 adaalat kii aapatti par prashanth bhushan ne adaalat kii karypranali par ungali uthaate hue kaha nyaayadhish jees khehar kii mahalekha niyantrak kii niyukti kii file centre sarkaar ke paas lambit he or shaayad yahi baat ho ki aap is maamle kii sunwaayee nahin kar rahe hai
 Expressing anger over Prashant Bhushan's remarks, Judge Khehar said, "if you had such a thing in your mind, you should have said it in the first hearing
 yah baat galat he, aapako adaalat par puraa bharosa rakhana chahie tha
 "saying this, Justice Khehar spoke of separating himself from the hearing
 justise arun mishra ne kaha ki aap desh kii sabase badi adaalat par shaq jaahir kar rahe hai
 They do not agree with this at all
 unhone kaha ki yah aarope sabase badi sanvaidhanik sanstha par lagaaya gaya he or avmaananaa jaisaa he
 Bhushan, while clarifying this, said that he is not accusing the judges nor seeking to change them
 unhone kaha ki adaalat kaa adhikari hone ke naate iskaa zikr karnaa unka ferj tha taaki baad main koi aarope na lage
 Prashant Bhushan in his reply said that he is not blaming the Prime Minister
 sahaara or birla samooh ke paas se iskar vibhaag ko ye saare dastavej mili hai
 They also have a 1,500-page report, on which they will file an affidavit
 adaalat ne kaha ki pichhali baar sunwaayee ke dauraan shanti bhushan or ram jethmalani ne kaha tha ki ve saboot record ke saath court main rakhenge, lekin aaj donon main se koi nahin he
 Explain that in the first hearing, the Supreme Court refused to conduct a probe by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) in the case of Sahara and Birla Group giving crores of rupees to the big leaders
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki kyonki maamla ek bade janpratinidhi se judaa he, sirf isliye maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh nahin de sakate
 Investigations cannot be conducted on the basis of the documents given, because Sahara's documents have already been found to be fake
 tippaniyan The court had said that anyone can enter someone's name in the computer, it cannot be given any consideration
 yachikakarta koi thos saboot de ko sunwaayee kar sakate hai
 If no concrete documents are found, do not bring the case to court again
 prashanth bhushan kii yachika main kaha gaya he ki sibiai or iskar vibhaag ke chaape main jo dastavej mili the ki unhone kai netaaon or kuch rajyon ke mukhyamantri bhi shaamil hai, inako karodon rupee kii ghoose di gai thi
 The matter should be investigated by the Supreme Court of SIT and the seized papers of CBI and Income Tax Department should be brought to the court
 ab is maamle kii agali sunwaayee 11 janvari ko kii jaaegi
 In fact, senior advocate Prashant Bhushan filed a case against the Prime Minister in the Supreme Court citing it as a bribery case
 is maamle kii shuukravaar ko sunwaayee thi
 The court, considering the evidence presented by Prashant Bhushan as insufficient, asked him to present concrete evidence
 adaalat ne kaha ki ye aarope gambhir hai or ucch sanvaidhanik padon par baithe logon ke khilaaf hai
 Since the Prime Minister of the country is being accused and the Prime Minister cannot be accused like this, if there is strong evidence, we will hear the matter further
 adaalat ne prashanth bhushan se kaha ki agar ve aise hi aarope lagaate rahenge to sanvaidhanik athurity kaa kaam karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 The court said, "we had also said earlier that we will hear only if we give any evidence in this case
" ' saath hi adaalat ne prashanth ko sabooton ke liye or samay dene kii maang par bhi aapatti uthaai
 Taking a dig at the court's objection, Prashant Bhushan said, "justice JS Khehar's file for appointment of Comptroller and Auditor General is pending with the central government and it may be that you are not hearing the case
" prashanth bhushan kii tippanee par khafa hote hue nyaayadhish khehar ne kaha, "agar aapke man main aisi baat thi to aapako pehali hi sunwaayee main kahana chahie tha
 This is wrong, you should have full confidence in the court
 " yah kehete hue justise khehar ne khud ko sunwaayee se alag karne kii baat kahi
 Justice Arun Mishra said that you are doubting the biggest court of the country
 ve isse bilkul ittefaq nahin rakhte
 He said that the charge has been leveled against the biggest constitutional body and is like contempt
 bhushan ne is par safai dete hue kaha ki vah nyaayadhishon par koi aarope nahin laga rahe hai or na hi unhen badalane kii maang kar rahe hai
 He said that it was his duty to mention it as an officer of the court so that there would be no charges later
 prashanth bhushan ne apane jawaab main kaha ki ve pradhanmantri par aarope nahin laga rahe hai
 The Income Tax Department has received all these documents from Sahara and Birla Group
 unke paas 1,500 pej kii report bhi he, jis par ve halafanama daakhil karenge
 The court said that during the last hearing, Shanti Bhushan and Ram Jethmalani had said that they would keep the evidence in the court with records, but today neither of them is there
 bataa den ki pehali sunwaayee main supreme court ne sahaara or birla group dwaara bade netaaon ko karodon rupee dene ke maamle kii vishesh jaanch team (esaiti) se jaanch karaane se inkaar kar diya tha
 The Supreme Court had said that because the matter is related to a large public representative, it cannot order an inquiry into the matter only
 jo kagajaat die gaye hai, unke aadhaar par jaanch nahin karai ja sakati, kyonki sahaara ke dastavej to pehle hi farji paae gaye hai
 The comments adaalat ne kaha tha ki koi bhi kisi ke naam kii computer main entry kar saktaa he, ise tavajjon nahin di ja sakati
 Petitioners can give a concrete evidence to be heard
 agar koi thos dastavej naa milen to maamle ko phir se court naa laaen
 Prashant Bhushan's petition said that the documents found in the raids of the CBI and the Income Tax Department that he had included many politicians and the chief ministers of some states were also bribed crores of rupees
 is maamle kii supreme court esaiti se jaanch karaae or sibiai or iskar vibhaag ke jabt kiye gaye kagajaton ko court main mangavaya jaae
 Now the next hearing of this case will be held on January 11

 Expressing anger over Prashant Bhushan's remarks, Judge Khehar said, "if you had such a thing in your mind, you should have said it in the first hearing
 yah baat galat he, aapako adaalat par puraa bharosa rakhana chahie tha
 "saying this, Justice Khehar spoke of separating himself from the hearing
 justise arun mishra ne kaha ki aap desh kii sabase badi adaalat par shaq jaahir kar rahe hai
 They do not agree with this at all
 unhone kaha ki yah aarope sabase badi sanvaidhanik sanstha par lagaaya gaya he or avmaananaa jaisaa he

 Justice Arun Mishra said that you are doubting the biggest court of the country
 ve isse bilkul ittefaq nahin rakhte
 He said that the charge has been leveled against the biggest constitutional body and is like contempt
 bhushan ne is par safai dete hue kaha ki vah nyaayadhishon par koi aarope nahin laga rahe hai or na hi unhen badalane kii maang kar rahe hai
 He said that it was his duty to mention it as an officer of the court so that there would be no charges later
 prashanth bhushan ne apane jawaab main kaha ki ve pradhanmantri par aarope nahin laga rahe hai
 The Income Tax Department has received all these documents from Sahara and Birla Group
 unke paas 1,500 pej kii report bhi he, jis par ve halafanama daakhil karenge
 The court said that during the last hearing, Shanti Bhushan and Ram Jethmalani had said that they would keep the evidence in the court with records, but today neither of them is there
 bataa den ki pehali sunwaayee main supreme court ne sahaara or birla group dwaara bade netaaon ko karodon rupee dene ke maamle kii vishesh jaanch team (esaiti) se jaanch karaane se inkaar kar diya tha
 The Supreme Court had said that because the matter is related to a large public representative, it cannot order an inquiry into the matter only

 Petitioners can give a concrete evidence to be heard

 chunaav jab sir par ho to netaa nai yojaanaaon kaa locarpan or udghaatan karte hi hai, lekin uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne mangalvaar ko ek aisa record bana diya, jise shaayad hi koi tod paae
 He laid the foundation stone and inaugurated 900 schemes worth about Rs 60,000 crore within 5 hours in a day
 isamen cricket stadium, cancer institute, multiplex, librari, olympics sies swimming pool, shaan-e-avadh signechar building or mandi parishad kii building sahit tamaam aisi yojanaayen hai, jo abhi puri bhi nahin hui hai
 Fear of the Code of Conduct, the inauguration of the election, the fear of the implementation of the Code of Conduct, how soon the plan was inaugurated and the foundation stone, you can guess that the stones were unveiled for the foundation, there is no digging of the names on them
 Was able to happen
 grenite ke pattharon par plastic ki shit chipka kar kaam chalaaya gaya
 While Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav arrived in Lucknow for the inauguration of the project, the stones of the remaining projects across the state were also unveiled by the CM from Lucknow itself
 iske liye lakhanu main ek hi jagah par chaar sau se zyada pathar lage the, jahaan mukhyamantri ne cancer aspataal kaa locarpan karne ke saath lage haath inkaa bhi feeta kaat diya
 Half the incomplete schemes were also released
 Among the schemes launched by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, there are many such schemes, which are half incomplete and which will take a long time to be completed
 to aise main locarpan kii is hadabadi ko lekar akhilesh kii aalochana bhi ho rahi he, lekin iske baavjood vah pichley ek hafte se tabadatod locarpan karne main lage hai
 Their reasoning behind this is that there is more than four months left in their tenure and most of those plans will be completed before the new government is formed
 siem akhilesh ko jaldi is baat kii he ki upi main ab kisi bhi din chunaav ke tarikhon kii ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 The Election Commission team is visiting UP these days to take stock of the preparations
 aise main akhilesh yadav saaf kehete hai ki jo kaam unhone karaae, uskaa shrey vah kisi or ko kyon lene den

Let Kissamira gave birth to a daughter on 12 July
 samira ko ek betaa bhi he
 Sameera Reddy is very active on social media

 rape, shaareerik chhedchhad aadi jaise masale kabhi skool ke class room main discus nahin hote
 Even at home, we keep children away from such things
 par kya vaaki bacchon ko is bare main pataa nahin hona chahie
 It is true that the first school of the children has their own home and there they should not only be taught knowledge, but also worldly things and things like good touch and bad touch should be taught
 par aisa har maa-baap nahin kar pate
 Therefore, the fundamental responsibility of school to educate and educate children from this perspective increases even more
 is baat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue dilli ke ek skool kii principal amita mullah neticharske naam khulaa khat likhaa he
 It has raised the issue of rape, physical abuse and social inequality in children
 har beti ke liye jaruri he amitabh bachchan kii ye chitthidilli ke springdels skool kii principal amita mullah ye maanati hai ki class room main padhai ke saath bacchon ko ling hinsa (gender violence) ko bhi samajhaana jaruri he
 Therefore, teachers should talk to their students on this subject
 hindustan times main prakashit amita mullah ne is khat main bataaya he ki har acchhee aadat kii tarah buraaiyaan bhi bachche apane aas-paas se hi pakadte hai
 Cases of stress, apathy, loneliness, sexual violence with children can lead them to heinous crimes like rape
 bacchon kii soch main ling bhed comics, filmon, vigyapanon, video games aadi se bhi aata he
 Boys start thinking from an early age that girls are weak and the same thing leads rape to a powerful thinking
 yaheen se is cheez kii shuruyaat bhi ho jaati he ki ladakiyon ko kaayade se rahanaa chahie, ve baahar khel nahin saktin, unako sabase baad main khaanaa chahie vagairah
 When the foundation of gender difference will sit in the brain from childhood, it will be very difficult to change it later
 isliye skool main shuru se hi baat par dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 It is also the responsibility of schools not to allow gender discrimination to flourish in children
 skool main bacchon ko ladakiyon ko baraabar samajhane, unki izzat karne kii sikh deni chahie
 For this, awareness camps and other events should be organized
 yahaan padhein puraa khat
 
 
 Dear teachers, Students are the rainbow in our clouds
 Yet, somewhere, the skies have darkened, threatening their sense of security and safety, especially with increasing episodes of child abuse and rape across the country
 Age seems to be no bar for these crimes
 School, home and community are a melting pot of emotions, desires, attitudes and aspirations
 One may think that the energies that reside in these places are positive as they are supposed to nurture our young
 However, there’s a great deal that lies at a subconscious level within the collective humanity that inhabits these places
 Feelings of intolerance, stress disorder, neglect, and sexual abuse often create attitudes that generate violent and deviant sexual behavior among adolescents and adults
 This leads to destructive tendencies, lack of respect for self and the other, which may culminate in rape
 The challenge is to engage with children through activities, dialogues, workshops, self-help situations and inculcate in them sensitivity, a sense of healthy intimacy that helps in building confidence and developing an understanding of the other's personal space - physical, mental and emotional
 Self-esteem, right to privacy and gender sensitivity are issues that have to be integrated within the psyche of the children as they grow
 The root of the problem lies in peer pressure, alcohol and drug abuse, media and the role models they create, and the attitudes that are endorsed during a child's growth - of objectifying girls and women, of accepting the male gaze, and of glorifying instant gratification
 The solution to the problem lies in first valuing the girl child
 Schools and communities should plan awareness and advocacy campaigns on improving the child sex ratio, since female infanticide and foeticide continue to rise
 As long as societies are imbalanced, and more aggressively male, rapes will continue to be a growing reality
 Movies, advertisements, comics and cartoons read and watched by children often perpetuate stereotyping of gender images and offer stimulation for sexual violence
 Rape is also about a show of power
 Many images in cinema, animation and video games often show women as weak and disempowered through a patriarchal lens
 This creates confusion in a young mind, leading to passivity of action and acceptance of an unequal relationship
 Men and boys are often equal victims to the way power operates in our society
 From childhood, boys are made to believe that they are strong and need to protect girls
 That is why we have to develop attitudes at home where we sensitize our boys to have mutually respectful relationships with girls
 Patriarchy makes women and girls agents of its own construct
 They often get sucked into believing and behaving in a manner expected by society
 They are required to be quiet, not protest, fast, eat last and sacrifice, all reflections of submission
 We, as educators, must ensure that girls become activists of thought and are able to articulate their feelings of anger, protest and anguish
 We have to instil in them the belief that they have the right to make their own cultural and social choices, whether it is the dress they wear, food they eat or customs they follow
 They have the ownership of their bodies and the right to choose the person they would want to live with or not, and to take up a profession of their choice
 Schools have become centres of salvation not only in the minds of parents and children but also of the community at large
 Hence, we have the responsibility to ensure that schools go beyond being factories of academia and skill development and become laboratories of gender sensitisation, empathetic listening and understanding diversity by not demonizing or objectifying the other
 As an educator, i believe that we must continue to create linkages between the macro and the micro, bridging the external consciousness with the internal world of our young, creating a common language and vocabulary, which is human
 No one has a monopoly over suffering and submission
 This is what we have to believe
 We must act TOGETHER, we must act URGENTLY and we must act NOW
 Let us commit ourselves to making our students more humane towards each other

 He said that after the complete assessment, whatever legal action will be taken, even if it is the eldest person, it will also be followed by legal action

 It is inconceivable why India chose an informal channel to call mps and take them to Kashmir? Is it because the formal invitation to the third party in the Kashmir issue will begin? But did India not accept the informal role of a third party in the Kashmir issue by visiting mps through Madi (madhu) Sharma, an international business broker who has called Britain's Liberal Democratic Party MP Chris Davies, emailed by Madi Sharma
 saat aktubar ko bheje gaye email main maadi sharma kahati hai ki ve europe bhar ke dalon ke ek pratinidhimandal le jane kaa aayojan kaa sanchaalan kar rahi hai
 This VIP delegation will meet Prime Minister Modi and visit Kashmir the next day
 email main pradhanmantri modi se mulaaqaat kii tarikh 28 aktubar he or kashmir jane kii tarikh 29 aktubar he
 It is evident that the consent of Prime Minister of India would have been taken before sending the email
 tabhi to koi tarikh or mulaaqaat kaa vaada kar saktaa he
 This work cannot be done without the activism of some unknown party of the government
 yah email kabhi baahar nahin aata, agar saansad kris devies ne apni taraf se shart na rakhi hoti
 Davies gave consent to Madi Sharma that he would like to talk to the people without security in Kashmir
 bas das aktubar ko maadi sharma ne davis ko likhaa ki bagair suraksha ke sambhav nahin hoga kyonki vahaan hathiyaarband dasta ghumta rahata he
 Not only this, it is not possible to take mps anymore
 is tarah davis kaa patta cat jaataa he
 Chris Davies is a European Union MP from North West Britain
 unhone kaha ki unke kshetra main kashmir ke log rahete hai jo apane parijanon se baat nahin kar paa rahe
 Davies has told the media that he does not want to be part of the public relations of the Modi government that everything is fine in Kashmir

 India turned down
 sanyukt raashtra sangh main imran khan ke bhaashan se bharat prabhavit nahin hua
 Due to the criticism of Turkey and Malaysia on Kashmir, India has expressed such a difference
 jab amareeki congress ke videsh maamalon kii samiti main kashmir ko lekar sawaal uthe tab bhi bharat ne aise jataayaa ki use koi farq nahin padataa
 It has been expressed on behalf of India that many countries have been briefed and they are with India
 upar zyaadaatar deshon ne bharat se kuch khaas aisa nahin kaha jisase zyaada pareshaani ho
 Rather, Pakistan was ridiculed in India when foreign diplomats and journalists visited their occupied Kashmir
 itnaa sab hone ke baad bharat ko kya padi ki ek international bijnes brokar ke zarie videshi saansadon ko kashmir aane kii bhoomika taiyaar kii gai ?jo saansad bulaae gaye hai wo dhur dakshinpanthi dalon ke hai
 There is no party that has a government or a prominent voice
 european sangh ke 751 siton main se aise saansadon kii sankhya 73 se adhik nahin he
 So why did India choose a weak side over Kashmir? Didn't the main parties get together as per their wish? By not allowing the American Senator to go to Kashmir, India rejected American pressure in this matter
 phir bharat ko in saansadon ko bulaane kii bhoomika kyon taiyaar kerani padi?kya devies ne maadi sharma ke email ko saarvajanik kar bharat ke paksh ko kamjor nahin kar diya? kya yah sab karne se kashmir ke masale kaa antarrashtriyakaran nahin hota he ? kya kashmir kaa pehle se adhik antarrashtriyakaran nahin ho gaya he? aaj hi sanyukt raashtra kii maanavadhikaar samiti ne twit kiya he ki kashmir main maanavadhikaar kaa hanan ho rahaa he
 Kashmir is an integral part of India
 aantarik maamla he to phir bharat videshi saansadon ko bulaane ke maamle main pichley darvaaze se kyon taiyaari karata he?iskaa sahi jawaab tabhi milegaa tab press conference hogi
 No statement has come yet
 chintaa kii baat he ki in sab soochnaaon ko karodon hindi pathakon se dur rakhaa ja rahaa he
 They are being kept in darkness over Kashmir
 aisa kyon ? aap kashmir ko lekar hindi akhbaaron kii reporting par nazar rakhen
 Read carefully the news of the visit of European Union mps in Wednesday's newspaper and see if all this information has been given? Political success on Kashmir will be achieved only when UP Bihar is kept in the dark
 jo channel kal tak kashmir par likhe lekh ke kisi duusare mulk main ri-twit ho jane par lekhak yaa netaa ko deshadrohi bataa rahe the, jo channel duusare desh main kashmir par bolne ko deshadrohi bataa rahe the aaj vahi in videshi saansadon ke srinagar daure kaa swaagat kar rahe hai

 It has been eight days since the Pulwama attack
 ab tak nahin soch paae ki kya karen
 It was also necessary to say something new immediately after the attack
 so raajnneetik taur par sena ko kuch bhi karne kii chhot dene kaa bayaan jari kiya gaya
 The government said that the army is allowed to do whatever it wants to do
 iske alaava ek or kaam hua
 The government abolished the status of Pakistan's most preferred country
 kulamilaakar ab ye dekha janaa he ki sena kya bada kaam karne kaa sochati he
 If the matter is of preferential status then it will take a long time to know its effect
 philhal asar yah he ki pakistan main tamaato mahange ho gaye hai
 Apart from this, if there is anything to be seen, it is the formation of the people of our country or the attitude of the people according to the demand of the time
 media ke jariye janata kii taraf se bulawaakar maahaul dikhaane yaa banane kii koshish hamaare saamne he
 Through the media, only one voice of the public was heard to attack the neighbor, that is, war
 vaise yah koi nayaa suzav nahin he
 In the last decade, whenever the soldiers of their soldiers were killed in a proxy war on the border or inside the border, this is the voice of waging war for a few days
 haal ke kuch anubhav hai ki vakt guzarane ke saath ye aawaaj bhi gaayab ho jaati he
 But who can deny that terrorist attacks on the country have not decreased in recent times and neither has stopped the process of killing their soldiers
 hamaare liye yahi aatankwaad he or yahi aisi jatil samasya he jo sthaayee banati ja rahi he
 And this is a problem that is not only ours but also the big domineering countries of the world
 unhen bhi nahin sujh rahaa he ki kya karen
 Reliable measures are missing
 karne ko sirf kshanik krodh he
 And being angry is the immediate passion of war
 dand kaa doosraa makasad pratirodh he
 That is, to punish so that the criminal does not commit the crime again saath hi kisi apradhi ko dand dekar dusron ko bhi daraana ki ve aparaadh karne kii zurrat na karen
 But in the current face of terrorism, the militants have started doing their work by keeping their lives on the palm
 aise main pratirodh ke liye maut kii sajaa pehali najar main hi naakaafi sabit ho jaati he
 The third motive of punishment in books is atonement
 apradhi ko samaaj se dur rakhkar, jail main, ekant main rakhkar yah ummid lagaai jaati he ki apradhi praayshchit kaa mauka paaegaa
 Well, this is a spiritual type of purpose and it is not yet known how effective it can be in a case like terrorism
 chauthaa upaay he sudhaar
 The Indian penal system is proclaimed punitively
 dand ko aisi pranali maanati he ki apradhi rogi hota he
 His treatment is possible
 lekin dekhne kii baat yah he ki jab ham saadhaaran prakaar ke aparaadhiyon ke sudhaar ke kaam main hi koi khaas kamyaabi hasil nahin kar paa rahe hai to aatankwaad ke maamle main to dur kii baat he
 The fifth motive is to rehabilitate the reformed criminal
 yani apradhi ko sudharkar samaaj main phir se awasit karana
 But for many reasons, where improvement is almost unsuccessful, the matter of rehabilitation is useless

 Prior to India, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had spied Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's relatives for nearly two decades
 gupt suchi se haal hi main hataai gayi intelligence beuro (ibi) kii do filon se yah khulaasa hua he
 The files showed that between 1948 and 1968, unprecedented surveillance was conducted on the family of Subhash Chandra Bose
 in 20 saal main se 16 saal tak nehru desh ke pradhanmantri the or ibi unheen ke antargat kaam karti thi
 According to exclusive information received by India Today, the files mention the surveillance of Bose's two homes in Kolkata
 inamen se ek woodburn park or doosraa 38 / 2 elgin road par tha
 Spying of Bose's houses started in British Raj, but it is astonishing that even the Nehru government continued for almost two decades
 woodburn park sthit bose parivaar kaa gharbaibh headquarter main phone karte the jasoosintercepting or bose parivaar kii chitthiyon par najar rakhane ke alaava, ibi ke jasuson ne unki sthaneey or videsh yatra kii bhi jasusi kii
 It seems that the agency was anxious to know whom Bose's relatives met and discussed
 haath se likhe gaye kuch sandeshon se pataa chalaa he ki ibi ke agent bose parivaar kii gatividhiyon ke bare main ibi headquarter, jise 'security control' kaha jaataa tha, main phone karte the
 However, the reason for this espionage has not been completely clear
 ibi ne netaji ke bhatijon shishir kumaar bose or amiy nath bose par kadi nigaraanee rakhi
 These two sons of Sarat Chandra Bose were considered close to Netaji
 netaji kii patni emily shenkal austria main rahati thim or shishir-amiy ne unke naam kuch chitthiyaan bhi likhi thim
 The Bose family is shocked by this revelation
 bose ke padpote chandrakumar bose ne kaha, 'jasusi un logon kii hoti he jinhone koi aparaadh kiya ho yaa jinke aatankiyon se sambandh hon
 Subhash Babu and his family fought for the independence of the country, why was he spied? Congress was scared of the return of Gharbos at 38 / 2 Elgin Road? Writer and BJP spokesman MJ Akbar believes that the only reasonable explanation is this It is said that Congress was afraid of the return of Subhash Chandra Bose
 unke mutabik, 'bose ab jinda hai yaa nahin, is par sarkaar ko pakki jaankaree nahin thi
 The government must have thought that if he was alive, he would definitely contact his family in Kolkata
 lekin congress ke paas darane kaa kya kaaran tha? bose kii vaapasi kaa desh swaagat karata
 But perhaps this was the reason for fear
 bose us daur main aiseekmaatr karishmai netathe jo congress ke khilaaf vipaksh ko ekajute karke 1957 ke chunaav main chunauti pesh kar sakate the
 It can be said that if Bose were alive, the coalition that defeated the Congress in 1977 would have done this work only in 1962, that is, 15 years ago

 While the maximum temperature in Bihar is breaking all its old records, the power problem remains the same
 aise main log ek taraf pareshaan hai, to rajya sarkaar bijli sankat ke liye centre ko doshi bataakar apni jimmedaariyon se pallaa jhaad rahi he
 According to an official of Bihar State Electricity Board, the entire state requires 2100 to 2400 MW in winter season and 2500 to 3000 MW of electricity in summer, but in recent times, only 700 from the thermal and hydro houses of the central sector
 Only 900 MW of power is available

 Abhimanyu Tiwari, who lives at the Amba Block Headquarters in Aurangabad district, says that the area has barely three to four hours of electricity supply, the rest of the time is just waiting for it
 aankadon ke anusaar, rajya shuru se hi bijli utpaadan ke maamle main pichhadaa rahaa he
 The maximum power demand in the state in 2009-10 was 2,500 MW, while the maximum supply was around 1,500 MW
 varsh 2008-09 main bijli kii adhiktam maang 1,900 megawatt thi, jabaki aapurti 1,348 megawatt hi ho saki thi
 Similarly, in the year 2007-08, the board had stated the requirement of 1,800 MW power, whereas it could get only 1,244 MW
 board ke adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki 2013-14 main rajya ko kareeb 4,000 megawatt se zyada kii bijli kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi accused the central government of power crisis in the state
 unhone kaha, 'rajya main bijli sankat ke liye puri tarah centre sarkaar doshi he
 This is the state of the state in the field of electricity only due to the apathy of the central government
 bihar ko kendriya cote se 1,722 megawatt vidyut aavantit he, lekin aam taur par 900 megawatt hi bijli di jaati he
 'at the same time, the state energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav said that the state government is trying to buy from the electricity market and an agreement has also been reached for this
 rajya main taapaghar lagane kii bhi pahal kii ja rahi he, lekin yah lambi prakriya he
 According to an official of the power department, an agreement has been made to buy power from the power houses of Eastern Region Gajamara, Darlipali, Farakka, Katwa, Talcher
 bihar ne sambandhit pakshon se vibhinn charnon main power parches agreement (pipie) kiya he

 Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said, "in an indiscriminate attempt to communalise the 2014 elections, the Congress is also engaged in communalizing national security issues
" is prayaas main congress ke pravaktaa shakeel ahamed ne indian mujahidin ko 2002 ke gujarat ke dangon kii upaj bataakar itihaas ke punarlekhan kii koshish kar daali

 The senior BJP leader said that while doing so, the Congress spokesperson forgot the international context of the Indian Mujahideen and Pakistan's strategy behind it

 Giving information about China's first public reaction to Prime Minister Modi's proposal, Deputy Director General of Asian Affairs at China's Foreign Ministry, Huang Jilian said that there have been 'problems' during earlier efforts to clarify mutual situations on the LAC
 unhone ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, 'ham seemaa kshetra main jo kuch bhi karen, vah rachanaatmak hona chahie
 This means that he should not be a hindrance to the negotiation process but should be the one to lead it
 ' Huang told the Indian media delegation about the results of Modi's three-day visit last month, "if we feel that clarifying the LAC is a forward step, then we should go ahead on it, but if we feel that This will be obstructive and may complicate the situation further, so we have to be careful
 ' Huang said, "our view is that to ensure peace along the border, we have to find some holistic measures, not a single measure of border control and management
 ham aachaar samhita par ek samjhaute kii koshish kar sakate hai or use moort rup de sakate hai
 'he said that the two countries still have time to explore together
 'sirf ek cheez karne kii jarurat nahin he
 We have to do many things
 hamen iske prati vyapak drushtikon apnaane kii jarurat he
 Comments yah puche jane par ki vaastavik niyantran rekha ke spashtikaran par china ko aapatti kyon he, jiske bare main modi ne kaha tha ki isse donon pakshon ko apni sthitiyaan jaanane main madad milegi, huang ne kaha ki iskaa kuch saal pehle prayaas kiya gaya tha lekin usamen mushkilen ai thim
 He said, 'we tried to clarify this a few years ago but there were some difficulties in it, which created a more complicated situation
 isliye ham jo kuch bhi karen vah shanti sthapit karne main sahaayak hona chahie jisase chijen aasaan hon, jatil nahin

 Paswan said - When he went to Hajipur, he also showed love and the anger of the people, Ram Vilas Paswan's refusal to speak about the rescue of Modi, should not put the blame of his 15 years rule on us: flood in the Manoj Jhabihar of Congress once again devastated There has been an uproar
 haalanki is baar baadh se aam log hi nahin balki viipi log bhi pareshaan hai
 Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who was stranded in the floods, could hardly be pulled out
 lajimi he ki har koi prashasan par hi apni naaraazgi jataayega
 So far more than 40 people have died due to floods in Bihar, so a large number of people are stranded
 kai jagahon par pani abhi bhi fansaa hua he or yuddh str bachaav kaary chal rahaa he
 People are angry: Ram Vilas Paswan: Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the state of Bihar floods that we could not go home

 When i went to Hajipur, there was also a feeling of anger among the people
 unhone kaha ki jal nikasi ke intjaam kiye ja rahe hai
 Relief and rescue work is in progress

 Regarding the state Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi's rescue, Ram Vilas Paswan said that he would not say anything on this
 jo dekhakar aae hai wo ham kah rahe hai
 Many districts of Bihar, including the capital Patna, are not affected by the flood-hit (PTI) government: Congress leader Shakti Singh Gohil, on the other hand, criticized the horrific flood situation in Bihar and the action being taken by the government
 The rains in Bihar and especially in Patna have happened
 wo behad kharaab he
 If a person has a human and little human sensation, then i say with a challenge that his night sleep will definitely get spoiled
 sonia gandhi ne pehle hi din kaha tha, or ab rahul gandhi ne kaha ki har congressi kaaryakarta jo bhi madad kar saktaa he vah karen
 Targeting the government at the Congress headquarters, Shakti Singh Gohil further said that no one has politicized the flood situation
 janata kii mushkil ko aapke saamne rakhana bhi hamaara ferj he
 The party that is in power also wakes up the soul of the MLA, but there is no effect on the government
 unhone centre sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki ek kendriya mantri ne kaha ki nakshatra ke chalate yah sab ho rahaa he
 Do not believe in science, do not believe in the meteorological department, but before coming to the elephant, why did you not see the pumps of Patna? congress ke hi rajyasabha saansad manoj jha ne kaha ki ye baat sahi hai ki bihar main prakritik aapadaa he, lekin sarkaar ko baari barish kii soochna thi uske baad bhi koi intjaam nahin kiye gaye, ye is sarkaar dosha he
 He said that just as the Deputy Chief Minister of the Nitish Kumar government, Sushil Modi has also been rescued after three days, seeing the picture, i felt that the entire government needs to be rescued
 is par tejasvi yadav ne bhi tanj ksaa
 The tragedy of Bihar is in this picture

 This means there is no need for the government
 sarkaar rambharose chal rahi he
 Nitish Kumar's government has completely sunk in Bihar
 'thik hi he nitish kumaar' kii pole khul gai he
 He taunted that Lalu Yadav was not allowing Nitish Kumar to work in Bihar and Nehru was not letting the central government work
 apane 15 saal ke dosha ham par nahin madhen
 How can anyone keep quiet in such a bad situation? log mar rahe hai
 What does the government want that after seeing this, put a tape on the mouth

 unhone aage kaha ki siver or drenez bahut hi kharaab sthiti main he
 Do not blame others for this

 Thousands of thousands of people in Bihar are badly disturbed and affected
 nitish kumaar ko ab sud ai he or samiksha baithak kar rahe hai
 Had this meeting been done earlier, this situation would not have happened today
 2 din pehle kendriya mantri ashvini kumaar choube ne kaha tha ki bihar main pichley kuch din se jo musaladhar barish ho rahi ye 'hathiyaa nakshatra' main barish badi hi gambhir ho jaati he
 The rain has taken the form of a natural disaster
 sarkaar isse puri tarah se nipatane ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 While former Congress President Rahul Gandhi tweeted and appealed to the Congress workers and said that they should immediately get involved in relief and rescue work of the affected people
 Bihar CM must issue a white paper detailing every expenditure made in last 15 years in the name of urban development, sewerage system, drainage infrastructure & disaster management!as always he is blaming weather, nature, Nakshtra & opposition for his 15 years failure
 - Tejashwi Yadav (@yadavtejashwi) September 30, 2019 Earlier, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav also criticized the state government over the flood situation

 It was said in the IB report that Ishrat Jahan and his associates are terrorists, so it is not pertinent to question it
 gujarat sarkaar to ye bhi kah rahi he ki jab ye maamla hoicourt main he, to aise main kisi magistrate ko jaanch karne kaa koi haq nahin he
 On the other hand, the Congress has attacked the Modi government by making this magistrate's inquiry report a weapon

 Amid a controversy over comments made by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, Union Minister and senior BJP leader m Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday rebuked that whenever the word 'hindu' is mentioned, to create controversy Efforts are made
 sansadeey kaary mantri venkaiya naidu ne ek samaaroh main kaha, 'hindu ek dharmik avadharana nahin he
 Hindu is a cultural identity
 ' bhagwat ne kuch din pehle kaha tha ki bharat ek hindu raashtra he or hindutv uski pahchaan he
 Venkaiah said in question, 'if Hindu is a religion then why this (the): Hindu newspaper
 ?
 
 
 
 yadi hindu ek dharm he, to hindustan times newspaper or hindu 'akhbaar' hindustan kyon? or hindustan mashin tuls (echemati) kyon ? or hindustan aironotics limited? phir hindustan shipyard kyon?' The Union Minister said, 'I can give you 25 such examples
 ye naam (pradhanmantri) narendra modi yaa venkaiya naidu yaa kisi or ne nahin die hai
 They are in our tradition
 15 agast ko, aap kya kehete hai? jai hind : kya iskaa matlab ye kahana he ki hinduon ko jai or baaki ko nahin
 Is it like that?' siesaiaar indian institute of chemical technology (iisiti) kii 70veen varshganth ke samaapan samaaroh main venkaiya ne tark diya ki jab koi 'swadeshi' kii baat karata he to iskaa matlab he ki bharat main uplabdh gyaan kaa dohan karnaa or aage badhanaa
 He said, 'we are not against getting anything from outside
 ' Venkaiah said, 'india has given home to all religions
 yahaan har koi swatantra rup se aata he
 This great culture has the potential to encapsulate everyone in this nation
 ' unhone kaha, 'yah is desh kii gahare tak jaden jamaaye hue samskruti he
 And now some people are trying to create controversy without talking
 or kuch log to, jaise hi aapane hindu shabd bolaa nahin ki ve sawaal karte hai ki yah hindu kya he?' All three incidents occurred within five days — two deaths and one election
 inamen se har ghatana madhya-purv ko sthaayee rup se badal sakane ke liye kaaphi thi
 The first death was undoubtedly that of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, who was shot dead in a rivulet in Sirte, the citadel of his hometown and supporters in the Alam of Afratfari
 phir, 22 aktubar ko khabar ai ki saudi arab ke yuvaraj sultan kii maut ho gai he
 The circumstances under which his death occurred can be easily gauged

 or phir iraq main or hameshaa tane rahane vaale israel-philistin main halaat ke phir karavat badal lene kii sambhaavna he
 If 2011 has been a year of great changes, one is hardly expecting 2012 to return to stability in the Middle East

 Many factors emerge very clearly
 pehla kaarak yah he ki akhil arabavaad ke saath-saath upniveshwaad virodh se yukt us rashtravaadi samaajwaad kaa ant ho gaya he, jo europea samrajyon ke bikharaav ke saath hi 1950 or 1960 ke dashakon main is kshetra kii prabhaavshaalee vichaardhaara ban gaya tha
 The ousted presidents of Tunisia, Jane Al Abedin Ben Ali, Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and Gaddafi — all linked to the generation of leaders who took power in the immediate aftermath of the independence struggles
 unke nijaamon kaa vaicharik paksh hameshaa kamjor rahaa he or jaise-jaise dashak bitate gaye or unke pariwaron, mitron tathaa sangi-saathiyon ke paas paisa jamaa hota gaya, vah paksh or kamjor hota gaya
 The three deposed dictators were among the firmest friends of Western countries until well before their downfall
 lekin ye netaa bhale hi chale gaye hon, to bhi unki aguai vaale puraane nizaam aasaani se nahin jaaenge
 Hence, the second factor is the ongoing struggle between the people in power and the aspirants of power under the existing system
 kranti ho jane ke baad bhi, sattashin zyada duragrahi hai
 Thus, although Tun Ali's political carrier Rasmabal Constitutional Democratic Party in Tunisia has been disbanded, the means of power are dominated by those who have benefited from the years-long dictatorship
 jaise ki association of tunisian magistrates ke pramukh ahamed rahamauni ne pichley hafte da gargian ko bataaya, na keval police or khufia sevaaon ke nrushans taur-tareeke barkaraar hai, balki ben ali ke prati vafaadaar rahe nyaayadhish aaj bhi nyaay ke bajaae satta ke sevak bane hue hai
 Rahmouni said, "the big judges of the country are corrupt and are instruments of dictatorship
" hamen unase mukti paakar nyaaypalika main bharosa behaal karne kii jarurat he
 "in Egypt, the army is aggressively giving up power
" chunaav baar-baar sthagit kiye gaye hai or ab charchaa he ki farvari main mubarak ko satta se utaarne ke baad koi kranti nahin hui, balki sainik takhtapalat hua he
 In Syria, where thousands of people have been killed in the ongoing movement against Assad's Nizam, the regime and its beneficiaries have clung strongly to power, and have proved more ruthless and obstinate
 use lekar chunki antarrashtriya str par na koi rajamandi he, na vahaan koi ekajute vipaksh he, na pashchimi deshon kii rajdhaniyon main doosraa sainik morcha kholane kii koi ichha he or jamini str par morchebandi kii behad bhinn sthiti he, aise main vahaan nato kii ore se koi nayaa dakhal die jane kii sambhaavna behad ksheen he
 In Algeria, an organization called The Power is firmly established
 yahi sthiti asantusht shiya samudaay ke andolan ke baavjood saudi arab or bahrain ke hukmaranon kii he
 Only one major change in Yemen — the departure of President Ali Abdullah Saleh — seems close
 isliye ladaai us shunya ko bharne kii he, jo 1960 or 1970 ke dashakon main upje akhil arabavaad ke khatme se paidaa hoga
 Its most visible contenders are Islamic alumni
 or nihsandeh teesraa bada kaarak, jis par najar rakhni hogi, vah raajnneetikrut dharm kii bhoomika he
 Although Islamic alumni have not gained power in any country except Iran, their popularity has grown rapidly in recent years as an organized, efficient, honest, and culturally conservative alternative to the West-backed bribery and inferior local rulers

 Another top BJP leader, who is in touch with these three leaders, said, "apart from praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's way of ending special status of Jammu and Kashmir by removing Article 370, these three leaders are heavy against BJP in Lok Sabha elections this year
" The majority are also affected by the victory
 ''in teenon netaaon ne dakshin, uttar pashchim or pashchimi dilli seat se loksabhaa chunaav ladaa tha
 He said that he can join BJP after getting the green signal from the national leadership
 unhone kaha, ‘‘inamen se do ne aap ke tikat par loksabhaa chunaav ladaa tha jabaki ek ne congress ke tikat par chunaav ladaa tha
 Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari said that many people are willing to join the party

 Shahnaz Hussain, popularly known as Herbal Queen, said that baking soda plays an important role in preventing sweat odor

 This will get rid of the problem of sweating

 - 27 disambar 1911 ko pehali baar bhartiya rashtriya congress kii kolkata (tab kalakatta) sabha main gaaya gaya tha, us samay bengal ke baahar ke log ise nahin jaanate the

 he adhinaayak (superhiro) tumhi bharat ke bhagya vidhaataa ho
 Along with this, different states of the country were also mentioned in it and their merits were told
 japan ke bhartiya damaad the ye bose, mila tha doosraa sabase bada aword- bataa den, vadenmataram ko bhi raashtragan banane kii baat kahi ja rahi thi lekin use raashtragit banaaya gaya kyonki uski shuruaati chaar line hi desh ko samarpit hai baad kii line bengali bhashaa main hai or maa durga kii stuti kii gai he
 It is not considered appropriate to make any such song a national anthem, which refers to a deity rather than the country
 isliye vande maataram ko raashtragan naa banaakar raashtragit banaaya gaya
 NSA Ajit Doval, who has been changing 'religion' for seven years in PAK- tell that the national anthem takes 52 seconds to complete the song while the duration of its version is about 20 seconds
 raashtragan main 5 pad hai
 Rabindranath Tagore not only wrote the national anthem, but he also sang it

 bihar ke munger main desi katte to pehle se hi banate rahe the, par ab vahaan gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se videshi hathiyaar bhi dhadlle se banaae ja rahe hai
 It can be understood that illegal weapons manufacturers are now making ultra-modern weapons by using the amount received from the Prime Minister's Rozgar Yojana
 hathiyaaron ke isi kalabazar par aadhaarit he hamaari ye story
 
 
 a central scheme in this district is helping people making weapons here
 desi hathiyaar banane ke maamle main bihar kaa munger ek paaramparik centre rahaa he or haal tak yah jila ek goli vaale desi katte ke liye kukhyat tha
 Now the trend of making foreign pistols and revolvers with the government scheme money has also started
 yah baat alag he ki sab kuch gaiyr-kanoonee he
 According to the district police sources, many youth in the region have set up lathe factories with loan money from the Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Yojana (PMRY) and other welfare programs
 kharad asal main bandook banane vaale chote kaarkaanon ke liye patrs banane ke kaam aati he
 PMRY was started on 2 October 1993 to help the poor unemployed youth to set up their own small employment ventures
 shuru main yah yojana sirf shahari kshetron main lagu kii gai lekin 1994-95 ke baad se ise gaanvon main bhi lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 Munger Superintendent of Police Naveen Kumar Jha says, "we are getting to know the details of people who took loans under the government scheme in the name of setting up small arms factories and have set up lathe factories
 ” jha se pehle police adheekshak rahe em
 Sunil Nayak had unearthed 14 such illegal arms factories which were established during his tenure to manufacture restricted arms by taking loans from PMRY
 abhi pashchimi champaran ke police adheekshak ke pad par tainaat nayak kehete hai, “kharad ke kaarkaane duusare kaamon ke liye hote hai lekin munger main unka istemaal hathiyaaron ke nirmaan main bhi kiya jaataa rahaa he
 i have arrested 20 people who were using lathe machines to make weapons
 ”anudaan kaa durupyogdilli main haal hi main 99 ‘maid in munger’ pistolon kii jabti ke baad dilli police kii special cell ko bhi yahi jaankaree haath lagi ki piemrwai se liye gaye lone kaa istemaal sthaneey str par bandooken banane main ho rahaa he
 The misuse of loan from PMRY may be shocking, but a more interesting incident came to light recently
 ganga ke bichombich ek naav par hathiyaaron kaa chota-sa kaarkaana pakadaa gaya
 The district police of Munger, who has been witnessing all the ways of making weapons here for a long time, also saw the floating factory and pressed his finger under the teeth
 police adheekshak bataate hai, “ve ek naav par leth mashin lagaae hue the or hamane jab unhen gheraa to ve bandook banane main vyast the
 "clearly, then it should come as no surprise that Munger has a reputation as the city with the largest number of lathe machines in the country
 police ke akalan ke mutabik ab bhi jile main kareeb 300 hathiyaar kaarkaane fal-phool rahe hai, baavjood iske ki police ne pichley kuch varshon main kai hathiyaar taskaron par hamalaa bolaa he
 Police work is not so easy in a city full of firearms
 haal hi main jab police ne jile ke bardha gaanv main hathiyaar ke taskaron ke ek giroh par dhaava bolaa, to puure gaanv ne palat kar police par hallaa bol diya, jiskaa netritv mahilaayein kar rahi thim
 Jha says, "the women were leading the attackers, who not only snatched back the six illegal weapons seized by the police but also accused the policemen of misbehavior
" ” munger police ke mutabik, bardha gaiyr-kanoonee hathiyaaron ke nirmaan kaa centre he
 Jha says, "there will hardly be a house in the village where weapons are not made
" yahaan ke zyaadaatar rahvaasee kai baar is aarope main dhare ja chuke hai
 As soon as he gets bail, he returns and returns to work
 ”jha bataate hai ki 99 pistolon ke saath dilli police ne jis mohammad firoz alam ko giraftaar kiya tha, use pehle bhi giraftaar kiya ja chukaa he
 In his words, "in fact, 80 percent of the people involved in the manufacture of illegal weapons have been arrested many times
 ”isiilie jab alam or niranjan mishra ko dilli main giraftaar kiya gaya, to munger police ko koi aashcharya nahin hua
 i once again add here, "the recovery of 99 pistols elsewhere may seem like a major incident, but we confiscate this same weapon almost every week
" ek haftaa bhi nahin bitta, jab ham kisi gaiyr-kanoonee bandook factory par chapa na maarthe hon
 " bhartiya captain viraat kohli kii jeet kii bhukh bhartiya team ko abhi bhi australia ke khilaaf kheli ja rahi test siries main jeet kaa daavedaar banaati he
 This is to be believed by the legendary West Indies batsman Vivian Richards
 news agency se ieenes se kolkata main baat karte hue unhone ye baaten kahin
 Significantly, the first match of the 4-match Test series was won by India
 perth main khele gaye duusare match main jeet hasil kar australia ne siries 1-1 se baraabar kar lee he
 The third match between the two teams will begin on Boxing Day i
e
 December 26
 american uniwarsity of antiga (eue) college of medicin ke brands ambeseder richards ne kaha ki kohli kii netritv kshamta or ladane kii jid ne abhi bhi bharat ko siries main banaae rakhaa he
 Vivian Richards told IANS on Friday, 'india have a great chance to win the series
 perth main beshak use haar mili ho, lekin vah abhi jeet sakati he
 He has a captain like Virat
 unke andar jeetne kii bhukh he or apane khilaadiyon ko jeet ke liye prerit karnaa vah jaanate hai'saath hi westeindies ke is diggaj ne mana ki steven smith or david warner ke bina bhi australia apane ghar main ek shandaar team he
 Vivian Richards said that i still consider India to be a strong contender for victory, but no one should forget that Australia is a great team apart from Smith and Warner
 jo pratibha unke paas nahin he uski purti vah apane nazariye se kar rahe hai
 Richards, who always praised Kohli, has said that it is too early to put the Indian captain among the greatest players of all time
 iske liye abhi unke kariyar ko khatm hone kaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 Richards said that Virat is my favorite among the current players
 mere kai paimaane hai
 i think we should wait for his career to end
 abhi ham is baat kii charchaa karenge to yah jaldbaaji hogi, lekin nishchit hi vah shandaar sthiti main hai
 Describing Sunil Gavaskar as the 'godfather of Indian Battleship' (bhishma Pitamah of Indian batting), Richards said that India has been lucky to have produced many great batsmen in different generations
 unhone kaha ki bharat ke paas shandaar ballebaaj rahe hai, lekin agar role model kaha jaae to sunil gavaskar bhartiya ballebaaji kaa bhishma pitamah hai
 It is followed by Sachin Tendulkar and is followed by Virat Kohli
 bharat in logon ke saath kaaphi khush hoga
 Asked about the fight between Indian captain Virat and Australian captain Tim Paine in the Perth Test, Richards said the Indian captain did not cross the line
 westeindies ke purv captain ne kaha ki mujhe nahin lagata ki unhone seemaa langhi he
 i think BCCI has said the same thing and i am repeating the same thing
 richards ne hamawatan bryan lara kii bhi tarif karte hue kaha ki gap dhundhane ke maamle main lara se behatar koi ballebaaj nahin he
 Richards said that in today's cricket, you have to see Virat Kohli and Brian Lara near my house
 main nahin samajhataa ki lara jis tarah se gap dhundhate the us tarah se koi or ballebaaj kar saktaa he
 It is very dangerous for me
 vah beshak chakke nahin maar paaen lekin gap nikaal kar purti karte the
 Sachin used to do the same
 richards se jab sabase mushkil gendbaaj ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki bhagavat chandrashekhar or denis lily is suchi main pehle aate hai
 Apart from these, there were very good bowlers
 bhartiya janata party ke sansthaapak laalkrishna adwani kaa aaj 92waan janmdin he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP Working President JP Nadda have greeted him by reaching home
 kabhi raajnneeti main ek atal-adwani kii jodi kii tuuti bol rahi thi or congress ke khilaaf raajnneeti ke sabase bade centre ban chuki is jodi ne desh main pehali baar gaiyr-congressi sarkaar banaai thi or jisane puure paanch saal shashan kiya tha
 But Advani's role in Indian politics will always be remembered for the temple movement
 adwani aise netaa hai jo raajnneeti main 'yatraaon' kaa culture lekar aae the
 LK Advani started a rath yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya on the demand of Ram temple in Ayodhya, due to which the politics of Hindutva had emerged in the politics of the country
 haalanki bihar main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri lalu prasad yadav ne unako samastipur main giraftaar kara liya tha
 This step made both LK Advani and Lalu Prasad Yadav the heroes of politics
 shuddh or sanskritnishtha hindi bolne main maahir laalkrishna adwani kehete hai ki unako 20 saal tak hindi bolnaa nahin aati thi
 He often says that when he used to listen to Atal ji's speech, he always got frustrated about himself
 bijepi main ek samay purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi se pehle laalkrishna adwani ko hi cheharaa mana jaataa tha or wo hi piem pad ke daavedaar the
 Advani also has an important role in organizing the BJP
 lekin bijepi adhyaksh rahane ke dauraan mumbai ke adhiveshan main laalkrishna adwani ne atal bihari vaajapeyi ko piem pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar sabko chaunkaa diya tha
 It is said that Atal Bihari Vajpayee was angry at that time and also told Advani that he would have asked me once
 is par adwani ne unako jawaab diya tha ki party kaa adhyaksh hone ke naate yah unako adhikaar he
 Both leaders had entered politics long before the establishment of the BJP
 donon hi aresas ke prachaarak ke taur par apane raajnneetik kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Atal ji was also associated with journalism and LK Advani
 atal ji apane bhaashan ke dam par raajnneeti main bahut hi teji se jagah bana rahe the to adwani rajasthan ke kota main sangh ke prachaarak ke taur par kaam rahe the
 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the founder of the Jana Sangh and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, were strongly influenced by Atal Bihari Vajpayee's speech style
 yah donon chaahate the ki atal bihari vaajapeyi kisi tarah sansad pahunch jaaen taaki unke bhaashanon ko puure desh kii janata sun paye
 But the story of how Atal Bihari Vajpayee met LK Advani is also very interesting
 atal ji ek baar sahyogi ke taur par pandit shyama prasad mukherjee ke saath train se mumbai ja rahe the
 Mukherjee was visiting the entire country on the issue of Kashmir
 laalkrishna adwani kota main prachaarak the
 He came to know that Upadhyay ji is about to pass through this station, so he came to meet him
 vahiin par mukherjee ne donon kii mulaakaat karwaai thi
 The third year of the Modi government's tenure was a period of strict foreign policy
 is daur main chunautiyon se upar uthte hue kendra sarkaar ne saahasik faisle kienarendra modi sarkaar ke pehle do saal khushgavaar lamhon ke khatm na hone valesilasile kii tarah dikhaai dete the
 When New Delhi was busy negotiating with the world's three most important capitals: Washington, Beijing and Islamabad
 inamen se ek doordaraj kii ranneetik bhagidaar thi or baaki do paas-pados kii ranneetik chunautiyaan or suraksha ke liye bure sapane kii tarah thim
 Thus, Prime Minister Modi and President Barack Obama met an unprecedented 7 times
 modi ne sabarmati nadi ke kinare shi jinping ke saath ek hi jhule par baithkar pingen leen
 Modi hugged Nawaz Sharif in Islamabad and visited his family home in Rawalwindi to meet his mother
 yah chakaraane vaali shuruyaat thi, jisamen bharat kii kootneeti ne nayaa josho-kharosh dikhaaya or yahaan tak ki pakistan or china ke saath rishton main bhi beshumaar sambhaavnaaen najar ai thim
 But the third year of the Modi government brought a sense of reality in some ways
 ab sambhaavnaaon kii jagah pakistan ke saath rishton main tanaav he or china kii lagaataar badhati aakramta ke saath rishte badtar hote ja rahe hai
 Part of the reason for these tensions is the emergence of a pragmatic and India-first foreign policy in the last three years, which follows the three pillars of trade, energy and security with only one goal in mind
 is niti main rajanyik dare bagaiyr chaturaai se waar jhelte hai or jaise ko taisa jawaab dete hai
 That is why an attack that killed 18 sleepy Indian soldiers is responded to with a "surgical strike" on the launchpads of terror in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (pok) across the border
 pehle ke hindustani pradhanmantriyon kii tarah pradhanmantri modi bhi bhartiya kootneeti kaa sur tay karte hai
 But while setting the priorities of India's foreign policy, he personally set a dazzling account of the journey of the global capitals one after the other, as his predecessors had done
 islamabad ke saath baatcheet main vahi tehraav bana hua he jo 1 janvari, 2016 ke pathankot airbase par hamale ke baad aayaa tha
 But the government took forward relations with other neighbors Nepal, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Qianmar and Sri Lanka and persuaded them all to boycott the SAARC summit in Islamabad last November
 is july main pradhanmantri modi kii tel aviv yatra, jo 25 saal pehle israel ke saath rishte kaayam karne ke baad kisi bhi pradhanmantri kii pehali yatra hogi
 His close relations with this Jewish country will eventually be taken out of the closet and brought into the open
 iske saath hi bharat un mutthi bhar bade deshon main shumaar ho jayega jiskepashchimi asia kii teen parasparavirohi sabhyataaon iran, saudi arab or israel ke saath shandaar rishte hai
 Modi's vice-captain Sushma Swaraj does not hesitate to take drastic measures
 pichley saal unhone adan kii khadi main ek hindustani ko bachaane ke liye yudhpot modeye ko kaha tha
 What will be a bigger symbol of the goal-oriented foreign policy! PM Modi's record: 54 foreign trips: Prime Minister Modi has made 54 foreign trips in the entire three years, combining seven more trips scheduled between May and July
 jabaki purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne apane 10 saal ke kaarykaal main sirf 80 videsh yatraaen hi kii thim
 At the same time, before that, Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried to strengthen the foreign policy of the country by taking only 19 foreign trips between 1999 and 2004

 The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved its verdict on the Rajasthan government's plea challenging the ban imposed by the Jaipur High Court on the conviction of actor Salman Khan in the black deer poaching case
 hoicourt ne salmaan ko doshi tehraane ke nichali adaalat ke faisle par isliye roak laga di thi, taaki film kii shooting ke silsile main britain jane ke liye unhen vija mil sake
 a bench of Supreme Court judge Justice SJ Mukhopadhyay and Justice AK Goel reserved its verdict saying that the decision to convict Salman could not be stayed merely because it could not get him a UK visa
 is maamle main salmaan ke atirikt abhinetri sonaali bendre, tabboo or neelam ke naam bhi shaamil hai
 It is alleged that he hunted black deer during the shooting of the film 'hum Saath Saath Hain' in Rajasthan, which comes under the category of protected wildlife
 salmaan ko nichali adaalat ne 2006 main doshi tehraaya tha or hoicourt ne pichley saal is faisle par roak laga di thi
 'now we will live without you, i will drink poison's life, so what happened that broke a heart'
 
 
 kuch aise hi gane pasand aane lagate hai jab kisi kaa dil tuutata he
 It seems as if all the heartbreaking songs of Kumar Sanu and Nadeem Shravan have been made for us
 velentine de aane vaala he
 Preparations are in full swing
 14 farvari ke liye saare aashiquon ne blueprint taiyaar kar liya he
 But there will be some people whose heart is broken this year, they will consider themselves to be very unlucky on this day
 ji haa, ham baat kar rahe hai vaise aashiquon kii jinka dil abhi abhi tutaa he
 Whose love has just got a punch
 unke liye ye velentine de bada dardanaak sabit ho saktaa he
 But in such a situation, it is prudent to maintain courage
 jo ho gaya use to aap badal nahin sakate or aage kii jindagi ko behatar banane ke liye aage badhanaa hi hoga
 Let us tell you that even if your heart is broken, how can you enjoy this Valentine's Day
 akele rahane se bachenaise maamalon main puraani yaaden badi teji se aapkaa peechha karti hai
 Try as much as you can to never be alone
 chaahe to is din apane doston ke saath kahin ghoomane nikal jaaie yaa phir kuch aisa plan kiijie ki aapkaa dhyaan banta rahe
 You can go to a relative's place
 Most of your time was spent with your love, in such a situation, you could not give time to your relatives present in the city, due to which many people were also upset with you
 ye vakt he vaise rishtedaaron ko manaane kaa
 So it is better that you give some time to your relatives, which will also change your mind
 maansik shanti talashenaise vakt main man or dimag bahut ashaant sa rahata he
 In this case, try to keep your mind and mind calm
 koi aisi jagah jaaie jahaan jane se aapako maansik shanti mili
 Where old memories do not follow you
 jahaan jaakar aap sirf khud ko samay de saken
 Stop listening to heart break songs
 It is usually seen that after breaking heart, most people start listening to songs which contain things like heartbreak and infidelity
 are janaab
 
 
 Doing this will do nothing
 aise main sirf aapkaa vakt barbaad hoga
 It is better to spend that time in work that can benefit you
 nae velentine kii talash jari rakhenek velentine chhod kar chalaa gaya to kya hua nae kii talash jari rakhen
 Let those who were left behind remain
 yahi sochakar ki shaayad agle stesan par koi or aapkaa intjaar kar rahaa ho
 It is believed that the lack of someone can not be eliminated
 laharon kii tarah yaaden hameshaa aapke dil se takaraati rahengi lekin behatar he ki unheen yaadon ko sanjo kar aage badha jaae
 Give yourself and your heart a chance once again
 use bhula dene main hi bhalaai he jise aapaki kadra nahin
 Life is beautiful, give it a chance
 inshollah, aapako koi aisa jarur milegaa jo aapako samajhegaa, jindagi ke kisi mode par aapkaa saath chhodkar nahin jayega or aapke toote dil ko waapas jod degaa
 They say no
 
 
 dil tuutegaa nahin to judega kaise
 :) mana ja rahaa he pichley teen maheenon se pakistan kii taraf se jo bhi aatank bharat main export kiya gaya, wo us str kii tabaahi nahin machaa sakaa, jisaki pakistan kii ore se ummid kii ja rahi thi, isiilie cader kaa hausala badhaane ke liye lakhvi kii rihaai karwaai gai he
 India's security system has prepared an assessment, which is under review
 usamen in baton kaa zikr he
 It has also been mentioned that Pakistan also ranks Lakhvi in the category of 'good Terrorist' and does not want to take any action against him
 yahi vajah he ki bharat dwaara die gaye saboot chaahe vah kasaab ke bayaan hon, david hedli yaa phir abu jindal ke bayaan, pakistan ne kisi bhi saboot ko tarjeeh nahin di
 a security affairs officer in the Ministry of Home Affairs told NDTV India, "the isolation of Pakistan's international session is over
" chaahe vah america ho yaa saudi arab, donon ko uski jarurat he
 
 
 That is why there is no more pressure on Pakistan
 "unke mutabik america ne haal main pakistan ko ek billian america dollar kii sainya sahaayta di he or saudi arab ko yaman main jari karrwai ke liye pakistan kii jarurat he
 On the other hand, after the rebuke of Pakistan on this issue by France, America and Israel, India will intensify its efforts to further isolate it internationally
 isamen koshish sirf videsh mantralay ke adhikariyon ke str par nahin hogi, balki videsh mantri or pradhanmantri ke str par bhi paak ke dohare charitra ko benakaab kiya jayega
 On the other hand, the Islamabad High Court in Pakistan has added to the difficulties of the Government of Pakistan by saying that Lakhvi's case should be dealt with in two months
 hoicourt ne kaha he ki agar lakhvi ke maamle par do maheene main faisla nahin hota he, to ise radd kiya janaa chahie
 It is believed that after this, Pakistan will once again demand more evidence from India about Lakhvi's involvement in the Mumbai attack
 is bare main sarkari adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki lakhvi ko lekar atirikt saboot dene kii or zarurat nahin he
 Very strong evidence against Lakhvi has been handed over to Pakistan
 in sabooton ke aadhaar par duniya kii kisi bhi adaalat main lakhvi ko gunahagaar sabit kiya ja saktaa he
