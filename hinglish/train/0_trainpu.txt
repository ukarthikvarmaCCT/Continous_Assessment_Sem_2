 The disputed structure was demolished in 1992 in Ayodhya
 bijepi ne ram mandir ke nirmaan ke liye janata se vaada kiya ki agar janata use satta saunpti he, to bijepi mandir kaa nirmaan jarur karegi
 The BJP, which won only 2 seats in the Lok Sabha in 1984, became the largest party in 1996 by the people of the country
 aaie thodaa najar daalate hai bijepi ke ab tak ke ghoshnapatron par ki vah kis tarah ram mandir ke mudde ko apni sahuuliyat ke hisaab se hataati or jodatii rahi he
 The pre-1998 manifestos are not available on the BJP website
 1998 ke ghoshnaptr main kaha gaya he ki bijepi ayodhya ke ram janmabhumi par jahaan ek asthaayee mandir pehle se maujuud he, vahaan bhavy ram mandir ke nirmaan ke liye patibaddh he
 Shri Rama resides at the core of Indian consciousness
 bijepi ram mandir ke nirmaan ke liye aam sahmati, kanoonee or sanvaidhanik sabhi sadhano kaa pataa lagaaegi
 The BJP formed a 13-month government at the center, but no steps were taken to construct the Ram temple
 1999 ke ghoshnaptr main ram mandir kaa mudda hataa diya gaya
 Now this manifesto became the manifesto of NDA and not of BJP
 satta kaa laalach ram mandir se bada ho gaya
 If you want a chair, then colleagues cannot be offended
 paanch saal tak bijepi ke netritv main centre main sarkaar rahi, par sahyogiyon ke dabaav main ram mandir kaa mudda thande baste main padaa rahaa
 Although the 2004 manifesto was still the ND manifesto, the Ram temple issue returned
 ghoshnaptr main kaha gaya ki endie ko vishwaas he ki ayodhya mudde ke sheeghra or sauhardpurn samaadhaan se desh kii ekta ko majbootee milegi
 We still believe that the judiciary's decision in this matter should be accepted by all
 us baar logon ne bijepi ke khokhale vaadon par bharosa nahin kiya or satta se baahar kar diya
 The 2009 manifesto has now again become the bjp's manifesto
 phir se 1998 ke ghoshnaptr ke 'kathor' shabdon kaa prayog kiya gaya, is ummid main ki hindu phir se bijepi ko satta par bitha denge or adwani kaa desh ke pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana puraa ho jayega
 But Advani and BJP could not win the trust of the people
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle modi kii lahar chal rahi thi
 Narendra Modi, in his election campaign to win the trust of Hindus, announced many times the construction of Ram temple
 2014 ke bijepi ghoshnaptr main bijepi ne phir ram mandir kaa nirmaan karwaane ke liye apni patibaddhta doharaai
 As a result, BJP succeeded in forming the government at the Center with an absolute majority for the first time
 agar modi vahi bijepi kii puraani niti apanaate hai, to agle chunaav main bijepi kii dobaaraa sarkaar ban sake yah mushkil he
 If the issue of construction of the Ram temple does not fade, the Hindu vote bank does not collapse, for this, Hindu organizations and especially BJP leaders keep repeating their commitment to the construction of the temple from time to time
 upi ke rajyapal ram nike or bijepi ke saansad sakshi maharaj ne vahi mandir raag phir se alapa he
 The old men of the time of the Ramayana serial are dead, the youngsters are now mature, but the condition of the Ram temple was still there today
 himachal ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ne bada elaan kiya he
 Talking to Aaj Tak, he said that 'I have been Chief Minister 6 times in my life
 pehali baar 25 saal kii umr main saansad bana tha or ab yah unka aakhri chunaav he, iske baad vah jivan main kabhi chunaav nahin ladenge
 At the same time, he also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the rigorous election campaign being conducted in Himachal and said that the manner in which Prime Minister Modi is repeatedly touring in Himachal, rallying and using the kind of language
 The language does not suit the post of Prime Minister
 apane upar lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon parvirbhadra sinhane kaha ki idi, sibiai, inakam tex sabhi jaanch agenciyaan unke khilaaf jaanch main lagi hui hai lekin is jaanch se nikalegaa kya? maamla sirf chaar karod kaa he or vah koi khanaabadosh nahin hai balki unke paas isse zyada sampatti honi chahie thi
 At the same time, Virbhadra Singh also said that he will remain the Chief Minister of Barimachal for the seventh time and last
 kuch samay pehle ajtak se baatcheet main virbhadra ne kaha tha ki wo apni jindagi main kabhi kisi cheez se dare nahin hai or chunaav main kisi kaa saamana karne se bhi wo nahin darate
 This is the reason why he is contesting from Solan's seat this time
 solan seat par congress 4 baar bijepi se haar chuki he
 He had said that this time i will change the game by giving this seat to the BJP
 9 november ko himachal main matadaanabta den ki himachal pradesh ke liye vidhansabha chunaav matdaan 9 november ko hoga
 The last date for nomination for the 68-member Himachal Assembly was 23 October
 himachal pradesh main sabhi 7,521 matdaan kendron par VVPAT vaali voting mashiinon kaa istemaal kiya jayega or sabhipoling boothonki videography hogi

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur said on Thursday that Nathuram Godse, who killed Mahatma Gandhi, was 'a patriot'
 unke bayaan par hangaamaa hone ke baad bijepi ne isaki ninda kii or is vivaadaaspad bayaan ke liye unhen saarvajanik rup se maafee maangane ke liye kaha
 Taking cognizance of the disputed statement of Pragya Singh Thakur, the Election Commission has sought a factual report from the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Madhya Pradesh
 bhopal se bijepi kii ummidavaar pragna thakur ne ek intervyuu main godse ko deshbhakt bataakar raajnneetik vivaad khadaa kar diya
 a senior commission official said that the Madhya Pradesh CEO has been asked to submit a factual report about Pragya Thakur's alleged statement by Friday
 unhone bataaya ki siio kii report ke aadhaar par ayog yah faisla karegaa ki is bayaan se chunaav aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan hua he yaa nahin
 Significantly, Pragya Thakur has been prevented from campaigning for the first three days for violation of Model Code of Conduct
 pragna ne bhopal main kaha, "nathuram godse ek deshbhakt the, hai or hameshaa rahenge
 Those who call him a terrorist should look into his own religion
 is chunaav main aise logon ko karaara jawaab diya jayega
 "pragya, who arrived in agar-malwa for a roadshow on Thursday, was asked by journalists to react to the recent statement about Godse of film actor and Makkal Needhi Mayam Party chief Kamal Haasan
 hasan ne kaha tha, "swatantraaa ke baad pehla aatankwaadi nathuram godse, ek hindu tha
 It started from there
 usne mahatma gandhi kii hatya kii thi
 "haasan later said that he was not a terrorist (extremist) but an extremist (extremist)

 There was a time, people used to write songs and it was filmed in the appropriate scene
 phir kahani par aadhaarit drishy par aadhaarit geet likhe jane lage
 Then what will be the tune of the song that is going to be written for a particular scene, in which raga it will be subordinated, keeping it in mind and started writing the song
 siddh geetkaar yaa shaayar ke liye yah koi kathinaayee kii baat nahin he
 He would not write the Kalpayana free flight and write the song following the specified scene, theme, raga and ragini
 par geet main praan bharne vaale tatwon main keval geet yaa geetkaar kii bhoomika hi nahin he
 His musician also has a big role in it
 geet ko jab sangeet kii lay taal par dhaal kar gaaya jaataa he, to us geet kii praan-pratishtha ho jaati he
 He speaks
 tabhi shushk se shushk hriday main bhi geeton kii ek raagini bajati rahati he
 Recently, a book by the well-known young poet Susobhit Shaktawat titled 'maya Ka Malkauns' on film songs, in which he has discussed popular film songs
 us geet kii visheshta, geetkaar kii visheshta, sangeetkaar, lay, raag, bol, banaavat, muraki aadi par baaten kii hai tathaa geet kii lokapriyata va karnpriyata par bhi chintan kiya he
 a poet, a particularly graceful young poet whose two collections, 'phantom of Malayagiri' and 'main Banega Gulmohar', have recently come and are a poet of pure poetry, when he writes on film songs or lyrics, he The lyrics are not merely a poetic feature, they are followed and followed by a full-fledged musical composition, visualization, semanticness, musicality, accompaniment by the accompaniment of the accompaniment

 In this sequence, sometimes the entire musical journey of the music composer is inaugurated

 Today, a generation of poets shrug their nose at film songs, but by going beyond these hymns, the studious embellishments have ignited the song in full anguish and gaiety, and by searching for its elements like pearls, Delivered in delightful articles
 pustak main 'uden jab jab julfen teri', 'piya bina piya bina', 'ye duniya vaale puuchhenge', 'jogi jab se tu aayaa mere dwaare', 'jane man jane man, tere do nayan', 'pankh hote to ud aati re', 'itnaa na mujhase tu pyaar badha', 'i dile nadaan, tum to pyaar ho', 'ye raat bhigi bhigi', 'tumko dekha to ye khyath aayaa', 'kahaan se aae badaraa', 'is nadi ko meraa aainaa maan lo', 'ye nayan dare dare', 'piya baj yak til jiya jaae naa', 'dil he ki maanata nahin', 'aaoge jab tum o saajana anganaa phool khilenge', 'i rangarej mere', 'mere rashke qamar' jaise geet shaamil hai

 "what is the importance of tuk in the song? It can be recognized by the art of winning the heart of Sahir of mixing rhyme with gorya

 a song written by Majrooh Sultanpuri 'piya Bina Piya Bina

 When a song is successful in a film, it is not just the lyrics that are successful but all the arrays and accompaniments through which the songs are threaded into the film
 jo veena kii jhankruti kii tarah kaanon main madhur ras gholte hai, avsaad ko bhi jeene kaa ek spes dete hai
 'jogi, when have you come through me

 This one who is unable to see the stain of the heart, can be distracted by singing how it is written, "for all those who have cried alone, whose tears have not seen anyone, he writes Not even that, for which the necklace of beads was made
 '''sehara' kaa hi ek doosraa geet 'tum to pyaar ho
 
 
 The manner in which the shehnai and flute player Ramlal tie the music to the melody of Rafi Lata's vocals makes the lyrics of Hasrat Jaipuri magical
 par tamaam visheshtaon ke baavjood sushobhit yah kahana nahi bhoolatey ki saal 2007 main sangeet kii yah agni shalaka bombai ke kisi upnagar main chupchaap bujh gayi or kisi ko kanonkan khabar tak nahin hui thi
 Many songs of 'chashme Baddoor' have been discussed by Sushobhit here
 'kaali ghodi dwaar khadi', 'kahaan se aae badaraa ghulata jaae kajraa' va' is nadi ko meraa aainaa maan lo' aadi
 But this song of 'saath Saath Saath' seems to be more important for Sushobhit due to the honeymoon duet from Deepti and Farukh Sheikh's love heart
 is kavi par kaviver muktibodh kaa prabhaav aisa drudhtar he ki unheen kii shabdaawalee ko lekar vah kahata he ki ''is geet main farukh shaikh ne ek anirvachaneey si anymanskta ko vyakt kiya he, ek 'peedit vivek-chetana' ko ki jaise dushprapya kii aatmahanta dwaidha se vah gahare guntha hua he
 'kahan Se Aaye Badra' song from Chashme Baddoor
 
 
 ' main guntha hua vishaad raag aisa he ki vivechak ke shabdon main, ''samay or spes ke sadiyon or milon lambey faasale par hone ke baavjood ham use sun lete hai
 "hiding her face in the palms of weeping Deepti, makes the listeners also stirring and disinterested
 is gane main dipti ke saath farukh nahi, rakesh bedi hai
 Another song from the same movies, "is Nadi Ko Mera Aaina Maan Lo Lo" is also one of the popular songs, but this song is also very beautiful because this film also has Shwentavasna Deepte's Nazuki
 khayr, yah har shaks ke apane mijaaz par nirbhar he ki vah kin geeton ko apane tain pasand karata he
 Each song affects the listener differently
 sushobhit ek kavi hone ke saath saath kavita main jaisaa metafar, jaise upmey va upmaan pasand karte hai, vah unki kavyabhivyakti ke liye jaruri hota he
 The songs he has in mind reflect his soulful mood, which he considers indispensable for life, love, interconnectedness
 yahaan un geeton ke saath unhone jaise ek sahyatra kii he
 All the things associated with a song only enrich those who read it
 mohenjodaro film main ek geet ''tu he meraa ye sansar sara
 
 
 If we listen carefully to what they say while opening "like this, this man, this desire, this immortality everything speaks within us
" 
 
 ''prem pragaitihaasik hota hekamna kaansyayugin hoti he
 We are a continuous epilogue to our wishes, their successive footnotes
 kaamana pretbadha kii tarah he, mritkon ke aahwan kii tarah
 She calls upon any past element within us and invites us to a death
 
 
 
 
 koun jane hamamen se kitne tab us vakt main un alakshith pranyon main sammilit sahabhaagi rahe hon
 This song, this elusive affair is known - inadvertently within us, the memories of our past lives, who knows
 ''lokapriy filmi geeton par isi kavitvapurn bhashaa main likhi ye sabhi tippaniyan gaate-gunagunaate hue geet kii jadon se phunagiyon tak kii yatra karne jaisaa ahsaas detii hai jinhen baanchate hue yaa likhte hue lagata he, jaise sushobhit raag-viraag kii kisi kavita shrinkhalaa kii ramya upatyakaon se guzar rahe hai

 vah pehle lalupur chouhan gaanv main congress vidhayak aditi singh ke awaas par jaakar purv party vidhayak evam aditi ke pita akhilesh singh ke nidhan par shok prakat karengi
 Akhilesh Singh, a five-time MLA from Rae Bareli Sadar seat, died last week after prolonged illness
 sutron ne bataaya ki priyanka lalganj sthit modern coach factory jaaengi, jahaan andolankaaree karmchaariyon se mulaakaat karengi
 It is worth mentioning that Priyanka Gandhi was given the responsibility of eastern Uttar Pradesh by making Priyanka Gandhi the general secretary before the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin party kuch khaas pradarshan nahin kar pai
 Even Rahul Gandhi could not save the seat of Amethi
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki congress ab uttar pradesh main khud ko majboot karne kii kavayad main juty hui he
 Priyanka Gandhi gave this indication during the Lok Sabha elections when she asked a Congress worker how the preparations were going for the assembly elections
 darasal beete 3 dashakon se congress uttar pradesh main puri tarah se saaf ho chuki he or party ko ahsaas ho gaya he ki uttar pradesh main bina majboot hue centre kii satta hasil karnaa he
 So far, the Samajwadi Party has sometimes contested elections with the help of BSP
 lekin is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa-basapa ne aapas main gathbandhan to kar liya lekin congress ko jagah nahin di
 It is believed that the Congress is now planning to strengthen itself on the basis of Priyanka Gandhi
 uttarakhand kaa kedarnath dham in dinon rajnatik aarope-pratyaropon kaa akhaada bana hua he
 The pilgrim priests here are alleging that construction works are being done in Kedar without taking them in confidence and this is reducing the grandeur of the temple
 iske virodh main ye tirth purohit 14 may se har somvaar ko upwas rakhane lage hai
 The Congress is saying that the work in Kedarnath is where the Congress government left it
 duusari taraf tirth purohiton kaa aarope he ki puri kedarpuri ko samtal karne, suraksha diwaar banane, teerthpurohiton ke bhawan, dukaan aadi ko lekar sarkaar katai gambhir nahin he
 Kedar Sabha President Vinod Shukla warns, "if the government does not stop working contrary to religious and mythological beliefs in Kedarpuri, then the Tirtha Purohit will be forced to take strong action
 ''asal main kedarnath vidhansabha seat kaa faisla yahaan ke 2,000 tirth purohit pariwaron ke 7,500 se zyada matadaataaon par nirbhar rahata he
 In the changed circumstances after the disaster, the role of these voters has become important in many ways
 aise main inaki baat ko nazarandaaj karnaa mumkin nahin he
 Ajay Ajendra, a BJP leader and president of the Kedarghati disaster victims and rehabilitation organization, says, "the demand for Tirtha Purohit is not very big
 ye log keval apni sunwaayee chaahate hai lekin inhen sarkaar ke khilaaf bhadakaayaa ja rahaa he
 "they say that the Congress is opposing the laser show in Kedar, but during its tenure, it had organized Kailash Kher's program there
" tab use kedarnath kii parampara kii yaad nahin ai thi
 On the other hand, former Chief Minister Harish Rawat is targeting BJP on Kedarnath's walking tour
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki kedarnath main kaam bina kisi vaigyanik aadhaar ke ho rahe hai or in kaamon kii ucch stareey jaanch honi chahie
 In response, BJP state president Ajay Bhatt says, "either Harish Rawat blindly visited Kedarnath Dham, or he doesn't want to tell the truth and is just doing politics
" ''tirth purohit kedarnath main ho rahe nirmaan se mandir kii bhavyata kam hone kaa aarope bhale laga rahe hon, par 29 april ko kapaat khulne ke baad kedarnath nae swaroop main dikhne laga he
 Reconstruction work in Kedarpuri is going on fast
 mandir praangan se saraswati-mandakani nadi tak 52 foot kaa rasta taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 a large park is being constructed by cleaning the boulders behind the temple in the disaster
 lekin congress ne kedaar main punarnirmaan ke kaam par apane siyaasi hamale tej kar die hai
 Former Chief Minister Harish Rawat has rejected the administration's claims like deploying sanitation workers, building toilets, waste disposal
 ravat ne aarope lagaaya ki pradesh or centre sarkaar ne baba kedaar ke vaastavik rup ko hi badal diya he
 He said, "I went to Kedarnath with both binoculars and microscope with me
 piem modi dusron ke kaam ko apana bataane main maahir hai
 They have presented our work as their own
 '' ravat ne kaha ki unhone centre sarkaar se maang kii thi ki mandakini ke kataav ko rokane ke liye 4,000 karod ru
 Project to be passed
 sarkaar ne unki nahin suni
 He says, "the state government has not filled even the pit of the road built by Congress
 ‚Äô‚Äôaarope-pratyarope haalanki apni jagah lekin sachaai yah he ki gaurikund se kedarnath kii paidal yatra main gaurikund main jiemvien rest house yatriyon ke liye taiyaar he
 Rest houses are ready in Jungle Chatti, Lyncholi, Kedarnath Bus Camp, Sumeru Tant Colony and Kedar Dome
 rajya sarkaar ne swargarohinee camp main kareeb 4,000 yatriyon ke thaharne kii vyavastha kii he
 Parking of trains has been made at Sitapur and Son Prayag
 paidal yatriyon ke liye pine ke pani kaa intjaam or blad bank jaisi suvidhaayen bhi sthapit kii gai hai
 11 ambulances have been arranged on travel routes
 sabhi paidal padaavon par asthaayee chikitsaalay banaae gaye hai jinamein first aid kit, oxigen janarator, jeevanarakshak davaaiyaan rakhane kii vyavastha kii gai he
 The Congress may also be angry at the BJP taking credit for its work
 par kedarnath main vyavastha pehle se badali jarur he
 *** punjab main congress kii sarkaar banate hi cabinet ke tamaam mantriyon ne saadagi or viipi culture khatm karne ke bade-bade daawey kiye the
 Some ministers removed the red light from their official car, while some returned their security and the government car itself
 iske baad ye mana ja rahaa tha ki is barcaptain sarkaarkaphi saadagi ke saath apana shashan chalaaegi
 Celebrity Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu of Captain Sarkar also made claims of running the government for the common people
 lekin in daavon kii ab pole khul gai he
 The government room that Sidhu has got in the Punjab Secretariat is being renovated
 jiske upar kareeb 10 lakh rupye kaa kharch aane kii sambhaavna he
 About 1 lakh rupees will be spent on falls ceiling, two and a half lakh rupees on furniture, about 2 lakh rupees on wooden work, about 2 lakh rupees for toilet renovation, about two and a half lakh rupees for AC, lighting and rest room
 vahiin siddhu ke sarkari kamare par ho rahe lakhon ke kharch ko lekar unke cabinet ke saathi mantriyon ne unka bachaav kiya he
 Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal said that the room allotted to Navjot Singh Sidhu is actually very dirty, the toilet is very smelly
 isi vajah se us kamare kaa renovations siddhu karvaa rahe hai
 Manpreet Badal said that this room was allotted to him before Sidhu but seeing the condition of the room, he got his room changed
 lekin siddhu ke paas doosraa koi opshan nahin tha isi vajah se wo renovations karvaa rahe hai
 Akali Dal has attacked the ministers of Captain Cabinet talking about simplicity on the pretext of Navjot Singh Sidhu's room, Akali Dal spokesperson and former minister Daljit Singh Cheema said that Sidhu is a celebrity and that is why he is also on his government room Spending lakhs of rupees
 cheema ne kaha ki unki sarkaar ke vakt unke kamare aam janata ke liye khule rahete the or saikadon log rojaanaa unki sarkaar ke mantriyon se milane aate the lekin ab congress sarkaar ke mantriyon ko janata se kuch lenaa-dena nahin he
 They just want to decorate their room so that they can sit there comfortably
 cheema ne kaha ki akali-bijepi sarkaar ke mantri bhi inhen sarkari kamaron main baitha karte the or unhen kabhi bhi koi pareshaani pesh nahin ai
 But Sidhu may not find these rooms as per his standard, that is why he is getting so much government money, renovating his room
 akali dal ne hamalaa bolaa to congress sarkaar ke cabinet mantri rana gurjeet ne jawaab dete hue kaha ki akali-bijepi sarkaar ke mantri kabhi janata se milane or apana kaam karne ke liye sarkari kamaron main aate hi nahin the, isliye unako apane sarkari kamaron kii sahi haalat kaa andaja hi nahin he
 If Sidhu had felt the need, then he must have got his room renovated, there is no such thing as extravagance
 vahiin sarkari kamare ke renovations par ho rahe lakhon ke kharch par siddhu kii patni navjot cor siddhu ne kaha ki koi zyada paisa nahin lagaaya ja rahaa sirf rang rogan hi karwaae ja rahe hai
 Since the formation of the government in Punjab, all the cabinet ministers of the Congress government have been saying that the financial condition of the state is very bad and in such a situation they are going to face a lot of trouble in running the government
 isi vajah se captain sarkaar ne apni pehali cabinet meeting main sarkari kharchon ko kam karne ke liye kai faisle bhi liye the
 But now the way the money is being shed like water on the renovation of the government room of Navjot Singh Sidhu, the high profile minister of the Captain Government, questions are being raised about the intention of the Captain Government
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii aguwai main bhartiya janata party loksabhaa chunaav main prachand jeet ke saath satta main vaapasi karne main bhale hi kaamyaab rahi ho, lekin dakshin bharat main karnataka-telugana chhod baaki rajyon main uske haath kuch nahin laga he
 This is the reason that after North India, BJP has started working on lotus feeding strategy in the states of South India
 mishan south ke tahat telugana or andhra pradesh ke liye ek khaas plan banaaya he
 Under this, the BJP is trying to replace the Congress in Telangana and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh
 telugana main bijepi kaa plansloksabhaa chunaav main telugana kii 17 sansadeey siton main se tiares 9, bijepi 4, congress 3 or AIMIM ko 1 seat mili he
 Similarly, in the state assembly elections held last year, TRS 88, Congress 19, AIMIM 7, BJP 1, TDP 1 and one other got out of 119 seats
 dilachasp baat yah he ki congress ke kai vidhayak baghawat kar tiares ke saath jud gaye hai
 At the same time, the way BJP has managed to increase its graph in the Lok Sabha elections and has emerged as the main opposition party, leaving the Congress behind
 isse bijepi ke hausale buland ho gaye hai
 Eyeing on the Reddy community, in BJP, the BJP is eyeing leaders of Congress and TDP who are unhappy with their own party
 iske alaava bijepi yahaan congress ke reddy samudaay ko saadhane ke saath-saath dalit or anya pichhadi jati ke voton ko jodne par lagi he
 In such a situation, the BJP feels that kcr's opposition to Muslim appeasement policy in Telangana may mobilize the Hindu vote bank in its favor
 andhra pradesh main tidipi kaa vikalp banane kii jugat memloksabhaa chunaav main andhra pradesh kii 25 main 22 siten jagan mohan reddy kii party wiesar congress or teen siten tidipi jeetne main kaamyaab rahi he
 Similarly, out of total 175 seats in the assembly elections, 151 YSR Congress, 23 TDP and one seat got the other
 congress or bijepi donon rashtri partiyon ko ek bhi seat nahin mili he
 The entire political base of the Congress has shifted to the YSR Congress
 aise main bijepi andhra pradesh main tidipi kii jagah lene kii jugat main he
 The BJP is eyeing the big TDP leaders who are angry with Chandrababu Naidu
 tidipi main kai netaa aise hai jo yah maanate hai ki chandrababu naidu kii raajnneetik galatiyon kii vajah se hi tidipi kii sharmnaak haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 Apart from this, many leaders believe that Chandrababu came out of the NDA and made the biggest mistake
 maukey kii najaakat ko samajhate hue bijepi ne tidipi ke majboot netaaon ko apane saath milaane main juty he
 TDP general secretary and former minister e Peddi Reddy is going to join BJP
 2024 par bijepi kii najarandhra pradesh main bijepi ko majboot karne or 2024 ke loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav tak party ko mukhya mukaable main khadey karne kii jimmedaari ram madhav or sah-prabharee sunil devdhar ke alaava jeviel narsimha raav ke kandhon par he
 a trio of these three leaders have started putting this plan of the BJP on the ground
 bijepi kii pradesh main praathamikta kapu jati par pakad rakhane vaale netaaon par he
 The BJP, which is putting the BJP on the Kapu community, has a population of about 18 per cent of the Kapu caste and their political rivalry with the Reddy community is well known
 reddy samudaay ek samay congress kaa majboot votbank mana jaataa tha jo ab wiesar congress ke saath jud gaya he
 While the Kapu community is the original vote bank of the TDP
 isliye bijepi kapu samudaay ke netaaon ko apane saath milaane main juty he
 Just before the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP made Kappu caste leader and former minister Kanna Lakshmi Narayan, who left the Congress, the party's Andhra Pradesh president
 raajnneeti se yah sawaal karenge to jawaab nahin milegaa
 After a lot of uproar, when the strong Lokpal did not come and after several years of fighting, the steps of police reform remained incomplete, then who to talk to
 supreme court ke aadesh ke baad anginat charchaaon kaa haal ham dekh chuke hai
 After a brief interval, the story of the administration and the police becoming hollow and disappears
 haryana main hi jab prakaash singh cameti kii report ai ki kis tarah prashasan yaa to hinsak bheed kaa saath de rahaa tha yaa unke saath mila hua tha, thode dinon baad saarvajanik rup se us report kii aisi ninda hone lagi jaise hinsa prakaash singh report ke kaaran hui he
 Therefore, the Uttar Pradesh Police will have to ask themselves the question, when will they be able to give the arrangement of their presentation to the system
 ipies adhikari mukul dvivedi or sab inspector santosh yadav kii tasveeron ko upi police vaale jaldi bhul jaayenge
 Elections will come a few days later and there will be uproar in the name of law and order
 phir chunaav ho jayega or vyavastha waisi kii waisi rah jaaengi
 In 2013, a village mob in Pratapgarh surrounded and killed an honest DSP of police Ziaul Haq
 baat muaavze kii nahin he
 It is about morale
 vardi majaburi nahin he
 Uniforms also have civil rights
 mathura main espi mukul dvivedi kaa antim sanskaar kar diya gaya
 Everyone from journalist to citizen said that Sir was a good man
 raajnneeti or prashasan ke gathjod kaa shikaar ho gaye
 If the police of Uttar Pradesh is adna or niche, they are looking at these pictures to look into their faith and conscience
 puche ki unki is haalat ke liye koun zimmedaar he or agar in halaat ke ve kaaran hai to kya ve kuch karenge yaa phir bhul jaayenge
 They know what is the truth behind these two deaths
 main intazaar kar rahaa hum ki wo ab of record kii baton ko on record karenge
 Santosh Yadav wanted to teach his son computer and Vedic mathematics during these holidays so that his count would be corrected
 mukul dvivedi ke parivaar kii tasveeron ko dekhakar kya ye ummid kii ja sakati he ki raashtrapati se niyukti patr lekar aane vaale tamaam ipies apane is sahyogi kii maut kii paristhitiyon kii jaanch ke liye khadey honge
 There is mourning in Jaunpur, the home of SO Santosh Yadav
 parivaaravaalon kaa ro-rokar bura haal he
 After the Mathura incident, talking to the police of many levels, it seemed that his morale was broken
 wo bolte-bolte khud ko kosne lagate hai
 Elsewhere in the police station, the sub-inspector is in charge of the inspector, in many places the same caste police station has been installed
 kai jagahon par ipies adhikari ko zila nahin mil paata, magar kai pramoti afasaron ke paas zile kaa charge he
 Someone said that there has not been promotion for many years
 zaahir he in baton ke prati uttar pradesh yaa kisi bhi pradesh kii police ab sahansheel ho chuki he
 The police has made its inner system so hollow that any soldier or officer can be a victim of it at any time
 ye sab jaanate hai
 Didn't everyone know that before 2 June, the Mathura City Magistrate ordered that the Independent India Legal Satyagrahi should vacate Jawahar Park by 5 pm on 16 April
 2015 se hoicourt kaa aadesh tha ki is park ko khaali karaayaa jaae
 But look at the state of administration
 is park ke bagal main hi ziladhikari kaa ghar he
 Every day, you will see that illegal possession has taken place
 ise khaali karana chahie
 But it seems that these officers, who are victims of the national duty of making a difference, may not have made a difference
 16 april ko prayaas hua, magar fail ho gaye
 Openly displayed arms and called himself Satyagrahi
 pradarshnakariyon ko satyagrah kaa matlab to nahin hi maaloom hoga, magar lagata he prashasan ko bhi nahin maaloom ki koi bandook lekar satyagrahi hone kaa daawa kare to usase khataranaak kuch nahin ho saktaa
 The City Magistrate ordered SHO Sadar Bazar to vacate the land
 notice jari karne se pehle zila prashasan ne drone camere se park kaa survey bhi kiya tha
 Additional force was also replenished
 15 april ke din pitiai ke hawaale se ye khabar bijness standard main chhapi he
 i am giving this information to know that nothing happened suddenly
 jawahar park 16 april kii shaam 5 baje tak khaali nahin karaayaa ja sakaa
 It was then covered in great detail by Dainik Jagran's Mathura edition and Amar Ujala

 tehsil karmchaaree 5 april se hadtaal par chale gaye
 The DM declared the strike illegal and said that he would return to work from April 16 or else action would be taken against him
 yani ye hadtaal lambii chali thi
 There have been many such incidents
 22 janvari 2015 ke din ziladhikari ne sadar bazaar ke thana prabharee pradeep pandey ko park main bheja
 It was reported that these people are building a gate on the birth anniversary of Subhash Chandra Bose
 kathith rup se satyagraiyon ne pradeep pandey ko gher liya or marpet kii

 The injured Pradeep Pandey got an FIR for the incident but you would like to know what happened
 ulta pradeep pandey kaa tabadalaa kar diya gaya
 In January 2015, Amar Ujala wrote that when these people started coming to Jawaharbagh in March 2014, their number was 500 to 700
 janvari 2015 main ye sankhya 3000 ke aas paas ja pahunchi
 Men as well as female children were also involved
 jawahar baag upi ke udyaan vibhaag kii zamin he
 Amar Ujala has written that it had mango, vine and amla trees
 is behtareen park ko satyagraiyon ne nasht kar diya tha
 Within Jawahar Bagh was the office of the Horticulture Department
 magar ye log karmchaariyon se marpet karte the, jinke kaaran unhone karyaalay janaa band kar diya tha
 Why did the administration not take action
 maujuuda ziladhikari rakesh meena kaaphi dinon se mathura main hai
 So they should have found a solution in these days
 esaspi rakesh singh bhi kaaphi dinon se hai
 Two and a quarter years after the death of Jai Guru Dev, several factions became contenders
 kaha jaataa he ki samaajawaadee party ke netaa shivpal yadav kii shah par jai gurudev ke driver ko gaddi kaa prabharee bana diya gaya
 Pankaj is a resident of Etawah
 ram vriksh yadav ko jawahar baag bhej diya ki aap vahaan jaakar dharna pradarshan kiijie
 What is the role of Shivpal Yadav, this can be proved only by an impartial inquiry, if the investigation is to be impartial, otherwise there is a tendency to say anything to anyone in politics
 ab sawaal he ki dharne par baithe in logon kaa jawahar baag main itnaa bada tantra kaise viksit ho gaya
 On whose request, gas cylinders started being supplied
 tub wel kiske aadesh se laga
 By whose order electricity was supplied
 dainik jaagran akhbaar ne likhaa he ki jawahar park ke bheetar ek system ban gaya tha
 These people were growing vegetables on the park's land
 satyagraiyon kaa puraa lekha jokha rakhaa hua tha
 a leave application was required to go home

 The comments in khabaron se pataa chalata he ki jawahar baag ke bheetar kya ho rahaa he, isaki jaankaree prashasan se lekar press or mathura ke nagarikon ko thi
 All kinds of news were being published, so the audacity of the satyagrahis had increased so much that they collected weapons
 netaji subhash chandra bose ke naam par ye log puri sena banaakar baithe the
 Where do so many weapons come from? aise logon ke paas paise kahaan se aa jate hai
 How does such a huge empire stand up
 madhya pradesh ke sagar main isane ek ajeeb sa abhiyaan chalaaya tha ki ek rupee litre main petrol-deazal mili, 12 rupee tola sona mili, gold karency chalaanaa chahta tha
 Does the administration bow down to the demands of such people because the religious base is also attached to them
 jai gurudev kaa apana ek dharmik samrajya to he hi
 Does the administration not know how to deal with them due to being religious

 It turned out that the ashram has its own commandos

 They came forward with the baton sticks to take the iron from the police

 The Satlok Ashram was empty, but there are some ashrams in the same Haryana where the police cannot go

 Then elections will be held and the system will remain the same

 This excellent park was destroyed by the Satyagrahis
 jawahar baag ke bheetar udyaan vibhaag kaa daftar tha
 But these people used to beat the employees, due to which they stopped going to office

 The current District Magistrate Rakesh Meena has been in Mathura for a long time
 to itane dinon main unhen samaadhaan to nikaalnaa hi chahie tha
 SSP Rakesh Singh is also a long time
 sava do saal pehle jai guru dev kii mrityu ke baad kai gut daavedaar ban gaye
 It is said that under the leadership of Samajwadi Party leader Shivpal Yadav, the driver of Jai Gurudev was put in charge of the throne
 pankaj itawa ke hi rahane vaale hai
 Ram Vriv sent Yadav to Jawahar Bagh that you go and demonstrate there
 shivpal yadav kii kya bhoomika he ye kisi nishpaksh jaanch se hi sabit ho sakati he, agar kahin jaanch nishpaksh hoti hogi to, varna raajnneeti main kisi ko bhi kuch bhi kah dene kaa chalan to he hi
 Now the question is how did such a big system of these people sitting on the dharna developed in Jawahar Bagh
 kiske kehane par andar gas silendar kii supplai hone lagi
 Whose order was the tube well
 kiske aadesh se bijli kii supplai di gai
 Dainik Jagran newspaper has written that a system was created within Jawahar Park

 Such a criminal empire settled in front of the District Magistrate

 Where do such people come from? kaise inkaa itnaa bada samrajya khadaa ho jaataa he
 In the Sagar of Madhya Pradesh, it had started a strange campaign that one rupee a liter of petrol and diesel, 12 rupees tola gold, gold currency was wanted
 kya aise logon kii maangon ke saamne prashasan isliye jhukta he, kyonki inke saath dharmik aadhaar bhi judaa rahata he
 Jai Gurudev has a religious empire of his own
 kya dharmik hone ke kaaran prashasan ko nahin sujhata ki inase kaise nipate

 The criminals who were making noises had escaped

 According to the information received, he did not have any enmity with anyone, but the manner in which the culprit has executed this incident, it is clear that his spirits were very high which is a challenge for the police
 aadhi raat ke baad police kaa ye hujum or dog squad kii team ke nirikshan se to pataa chal hi gaya hoga kii maamla sangeen he
 And why not, there is a case of murder of Rajesh and his relative Beda Yadav, the only son of Jeet Yadav, the owner of Karthike Dharma Fork
 abhi tak is hatya ke kaaran kaa pataa nahin he
 Neither the householders are able to tell nor the police have not been able to reach any conclusion
 lekin jis tarah kii goli maukey se mili he usase yah lag rahaa he ki hatya peshewar hatyaron ne anjaam diya he
 Uttarakhand is also not untouched by the declining sex ratio in the entire country
 haalanki do dashak pehle pahari ilaakon main yah samasya nahin thi, lekin ab yahaan bhi halaat badtar ho rahe hai

 lekin shahari sabhy samaajon kii tulana main adivasee samaaj main aaj bhi ladakiyon kii us tarah hatya nahin kii jaati
 Seema, Sunita, Ganga, Radha and Rakhi are five girls of the same mother who were not killed in the womb due to the desire of the boy

 baavjood iske pichley ek dashak ne buksa samaaj ko bhi ling pareekshan or ladki ko garbh main hi khatm kar dene kii aadhunik takanic se jod diya he
 But Yashoda is not among those women
 usne saas-sasur, ghar-parivaar va samaaj se ek saath morcha liya
 She repeatedly agreed to be pregnant for the sake of the boy, but she fought wholeheartedly against finishing him when the girl was born
 parivaar chuta, naate-rishtedaaron ne kinaaraa kar liya, pati kaa hona, na hona bhi baraabar he kyonki betaa paidaa na hone se vah bhi khush nahin he
 While the number of girls in the state and the country is steadily decreasing, female feticide is killing a large number of girls, in such a situation, against the will of all, Yashoda gives birth to eight consecutive girls and against killing them in the womb Standing is a sign of great courage
 yashoda kahati he, ‚Äò‚Äòpehali ladki hone par kai dinon tak sasuraal ke log mere paas nahin aae the

 aapako 2004 ke april main pakistan ke khilaaf vishakhapatnam ke match kii yaad he? navagantuk or kandhe tak lambey baalo vaale wicket keeper ballebasemahendra singh dhonine pakistaniyon ko washing powder se dhoyaa or 123 gendon main 148 ran kuta die the
 Then you will also remember the Jaipur ODI in October 2005, when Dhoni scored 183 not out from 145 balls against Sri Lanka
 pakistan ke khilaaf 2006 kii farvari main lahore main naabad 72 ran kii pari ho, yaa phir karanchi main 56 gendon main naabad 77 ran
 Even in the 2011 World Cup final, Dhoni's unassuming face would have brought a smile to your face when he hit just 79 balls for an unbeaten innings of 91 runs
 hamaara vahi dhoni ipiel main waapas aa gaya lagata he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni is seen in his old avatar in the new season of IPL
 dhunaai ke ustad
 The same Dhoni, for whom we have been praising him
 pile kapadon main dhoni vahi maahi najar aa rahe hai, jise barason pehle hamane dekha tha, tab, jab unke bal kandhon tak aate the or thode bargandi color main range hote the
 Dhoni was a young man then
 par aaj ke dhoni ke haathon kut-piskar gendbaaj jab gend ko hawa main udakar darshakon ke bich girte dekh rahe hote hai, tab jaakar unhen yakeen hota he ki are, umr ke chauthe dashak main chal rahe adhed dhoni ke haathon main harkulies vaali takat abhi bhi barkaraar he
 And Dhoni is using that power very well
 ipiel ke gyarahawein sanskaran main dhoni ne 10 maichon main 360 ranon kaa pahaad khadaa kar diya or unka ausat bhi gajab kaa he
 Yes, 90's
 haalanki iske liye unhone koi shatak to nahin jadaa or unka ucchtam score 79 naabad rahaa he
 But in these 10 matches, Dhoni has flown 27 sixes
 strike rate, yani sidhi bhashaa main kahen ko moosal chalaane kii dar 166 ke aasapaas he
 This time Dhoni scored 25 off 12 balls against Sunrisers Hyderabad, 79 not out off 44 balls against Punjab, 70 not out in 34 balls against Bangalore, 26 off 21 balls against Mumbai, 51 off 22 balls against Delhi, and Kolkata
 Has scored 43 unbeaten runs in 25 balls against
 ab chennai ke pichley match main dhoni kii pari par gaur farmaaie
 Dhoni bowled three sixes in the same over to Yuzvendra Chahal, who was said to have troubled Dhoni with his spin
 jaahir he chahal kii gendon ko darshakon ke bich pahunchaakar maahi ne sabit kar diya ki bade khilaadi ko bas ek dfa gear badalanaa hota he
 Personally, Virat Kohli is playing well but a captain should be as good as his team, Dhoni understands it very well
 isi sthiti ko banaae rakhane ke liye har baar unki koshish hoti he ki ve sahi team banaakar maidan main utren
 They name it choosing horses for different races
 is tareeke par sawaal bhi uthe hai or kai baar galat chunaav bhi hue hai, lekin har baar ve nattejey sahi dekar apane chunaav ko sahi tehraate aae hai
 If anyone can give a challenge to Dhoni to remain normal even after victory, then he is the only Indian Abhinav Bindra
 cricket main shant bane rahane kii jarurat nahin hoti, uske baavjood dhoni ne apane dhairya se apni shakhsiyat ko or abha hi bakshi he
 It is a sign of a mature and stable brain, which realizes that success is not a one-time thing, it has to be sustained
 aise log atiutsahit nahin hote
 They keep their happiness to themselves, thus achieving more achievements than average people
 ek kissah gwalior main dhoni nae khilaadiyon ko unase ballebaaji ke gur sikhta dekh rahe the, ki kaise baclift, pairon kaa istemaal or dephence karnaa he
 After the session, he asked cricket coach MP Singh to teach him all that again
 singh akachaka gaye
 He said, "you are an Indian player, have scored a century and now you want to learn all this?" Dhoni said effortlessly, "it is important to learn, anytime
" ‚Äù jaahir he, khel dhoni ke swabhaav main he or captaini unke liye paidaaishi baat he
 Probably before IPL, Dhoni took the decision not to play international cricket for almost a month to remodel himself
 film dhoni- da antold story kaa vah drishy yaad kariye, jab apni motorcykilon kii dekharekh karte vakt dhoni vah cheez hasil kar lete hai, jo unako kaamyaab hone se roak rahi thi
 Dhoni is not meant for defensive play
 yahi baat film main bhi unase kahi gai thi, or yahi baat shaayad dhoni ne is baar samaj bhi lee
 Growing old, he felt that he needed to work on his timing
 dhoni ne apane ballon (vah amuman apni pariyon main do vajan ke alag-alag ballon kaa istemaal karte hai) ke vajan ko kam kar liya he
 This has made their timing better
 or shaayad is vajah se dhoni vahi shots laga paa rahe hai, jiske mureed ham sabhi rahe hai
 He has always silenced critics and made his point known to senior players
 unhone chote shaharon kii ek samoochee peedi ke liye prerana kaa kaam kiya he
 It is not easy to describe Dhoni's story in words
 unki pari ab bhi jari he
 Dhoni, who shot the helicopter, has established himself like a rocket this time
 dhoni ke diwane ek dfa phir gaganchumbi chhakkon or sanasanaate chaukon kii barsaat se gendon ke dhaage khulte dekh rahe hai
 Commentators are surprised by his sharp eyesight as Dhoni review system, sometimes giving money as Dhoni Dhanadhan Dhoni
 kabhi unako tanj se mahendra bahubali kehane vaale sahvaag jaise camentator khamosh hai
 Dhoni is also silent, but his bat is speaking

 Social activist Anna Hazare, after starting his one-day fast at Rajghat, said that if the government did not support the public on the issue of tackling corruption, it would be the second battle for 'independence' of the country at Jantar Mantar from August 16
 Will start hajaare, baba ramdev or unke samarthakon ke khilaaf ramlila maidan par hui police karrwai ke virodh main rajghat par anshan kar rahe hai
 Before going on a hunger strike, he visited the tomb of Mahatma Gandhi and paid homage to the Father of the Nation there
 apane samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue hajaare ne sidhe sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa or kaha, agar sarkaar ne bhrashtachar se nipatane ke mudde par janata kaa saath nahin diya, to ham 16 agast se jantar-mantar par desh kii aazaadee kii duusari ladaai shuru karenge
 Hazare said that from August 16, this movement will last as long as my body remains alive
 hajaare ne kaha, ham tab tak ladenge, jab tak satta puri tarah logon ke haath main nahin hogi
 We need another movement for independence to change the system
 janata hi saansadon or vidhayakon ko chunati he
 The government should give maximum powers to the gram sabhas for decentralization of power
 unhone kaha, sarkaar or ham alag nahin hai
 In a way, we are one
 sarkaar ke dimag main khud ke aakaa hone kaa bhav he
 She considers herself the owner, while she should not forget that after becoming a republic on January 26, 1950, the people of the country have become the owners of this country
 hajaare rajghat ke saamne gandhi darshan par anshan kar rahe hai
 He is sitting alone on the stage, while his fellow workers Shanti Bhushan, Kiran Bedi, Arvind Kejriwal and Swami Agnivesh etc
 are sitting with the general public on the ground
 baba ramdev or unke samarthakon par hui karrwai kii ninda karte hue hajaare ne kaha, raat ko sote logon par laathiyaan chalaanaa maanavtaa par kalank lagane or lokshahi kaa galaa ghontne jaisi ghatana he
 We have gathered here today to protest against this
 ramlila maidan par sirf goli hi nahin chali
 The rest of the injustice and atrocities remind us of the incident of Jallianwala Bagh
 vahaan maujuud samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue swami agnivesh ne kaha ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan janata ne hajaare ke saath hi baba ramdev ke netritv main bhi shuru kiya he, lekin april main anna dwaara jantar-mantar par kiye gaye anshan ke dauraan agar police karrwai hoti to anna giraftaar de dete
 Referring to Hazare and indirectly targeting Ramdev, Agnivesh said that in April, Hazare had peacefully fasted on the Lokpal issue at jantar-mantar and if police action had been taken there then, Hazare would not have been there
 Would have rather arrested peacefully
 unhone kaha ki april main anna ke netritv main 4 din tak shantipurvak virodh pradarshan kiya gaya or 4 din ke anshan ke baad sarkaar ne anna kii maangen maan leen, to unhone anshan khatm kar diya tha
 Swami Agnivesh said that Hazare had promised the government that he would end his fast after accepting their demands and since then talks have been going on continuously with the ministers of the government about Lokpal and this is the demand for democracy
 unhone kaha, ham se kal sawaal kiye gaye the ki agar rajghat par ramlila maidan kii tarah kii karrwai hui to kya hoga, to hamane kaha tha ki april main jab jantar-mantar par anshan ke dauraan koi gadabadi nahin hui, to ab kaise hogi
 He asked if we were not allowed to go on hunger strike at Jantar Mantar, so did we get angry
 swami agnivesh ne haalanki ramalali maidan par hui police karrwai kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki sarkaar kam se kam yah kah de ki ramlila maidan main jo kuch hua vah galat tha, to bhi thik he
 He said that if the government accepts its mistake, then its stature will not decrease
 swami ne kaha ki ramlila maidan par bekasoor logon par lathi chalaanaa nindaneey ghatana thi
 He said, there may be differences on our issues, but we are unanimous about the fundamental rights of the people
 is bich, anshan sthal par logon kaa jamaavada badhata hi ja rahaa he or hajaare ke samarthak suraksha karmiyon se avarohak hataane kaa aagrah karte dekhe gaye, taaki logon ko aane jane main dikkat na ho
 On the other hand, the number of policemen around the hunger strike has also been increased

 The battle of the 'boss' in SP, apparently just before the UP elections, this haggling within the ruling party can have a negative impact on the electoral constituency, but one thing is clear that the exercise has started in SP now to show who the real boss is
 is

 The political analyst considers the CM to be the image of the government, that in reality the entire fight is about the image
 akhilesh bataur soobe ke mukhiya apni sarkaar kii chhavi ko lekar achaanak se behad sanjeeda ho gaye hai
 That is why, before the elections, he is preparing to crack down on corrupt and tainted faces

 But under the pressure of Mulayam Singh Yadav, he had to make Deepak Singhal the Chief Secretary
 rahul bhatnagar bane mukhya sachivvitt vibhaag ke pramukh sachiv rahul prasad bhatnagar ko nayaa mukhya sachiv banaaya gaya he
 Rahul Bhatnagar is a 1983 batch IAS officer and has held various important positions including the sugarcane commissioner

 Deepak Singhal is currently on the waiting list
 mukhya sachiv banane ke baad deepak singhl ke taur tareeke se mukhyamantrikhilesh yadavakhush nahin the
 The unseen manner in which Deepak Singhal spoke from the stage in many public functions was constantly knocking Akhilesh Yadav
 jab manch par akhilesh se kaha- baatcheet baad main karen, pehle meri baat sunempichley maheene kanya vidyadhan baantne ke ek samaaroh main log us samay dang rah gaye jab deepak singhl ne manch par mike se mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav se kaha tha ki vah baatcheet baad main karen, pehle unki baat dhyaan se sunen
 The Chief Minister was discussing something with his mentor Alok Ranjan at the time
 deepak singhl ne alok ranjan jo unase pehle mukhya sachiv the, unhen bhi tokate hue kaha tha ki salaahkaar mahoday salaah baad main den
 In another function, Deepak Singhal had said that Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has children from both heart and mind

 It is also being said that the way the High Court ordered a CBI inquiry on mining in Uttar Pradesh and the government could not properly advocate in its court
 usase bhi mukhyamantri khafa hue
 According to heavy sources, Amar Singh had to go to the party, the real reason was the involvement of Deepak Singhal in Amar Singh's party in Delhi on Sunday
 is party main mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav nahin gaye the
 Sometime back, Amar Singh said many things against Akhilesh Yadav
 uske baavjood apane mukhya sachiv kaa amar singh kii party main janaa mukhyamantri ko bilkul pasand nahin aayaa hoga
 Singhal, who is considered to be special to the Governor, Akhilesh Yadav, who was trying to improve the image of his government, sacked two of his cabinet ministers Gayatri Prajapati and Raj Kishore Singh on Monday because they were accused of corruption
 mukhya sachiv banane ke liye deepak singhl ne mulaayam singh or shivpal yadav ke darbar main kai chakkar lagaae the
 Deepak Singhal is considered to be special of Shivpal Yadav
 kaumi ekta dal ko lekar shivpal yadav se akhilesh yadav kii khinchataan pehle se hi chal rahi he
 In such a situation, the sacrifice of the close officer of Shivpal Yadav on the day of Bakrid will be looked at by the people who feed on the Samajwadi Party and the UP government

 Not even two months after the formation of the new government, it was reported that spying equipment was found at a senior minister's house
 sadak parivahan or rajmarg mantri nitin gadakari ke 13 tinmurti len sthit nivas se kuch jasusi upkaran baraamad hue
 It is said that these devices were installed to listen to the conversations taking place there and they were very good
 ye amuman videshi agenciyon khaskar siie or enese dwaara istemaal kiye jate hai
 These devices have been recovered, but the question of 1
25 lakh vaccines has arisen that who were those people who got them installed at Gadkari's residence? Now it is also heard that Gadkari said that these devices were found in his residence in Mumbai, not Delhi
 baharhaal baat ek hi he
 The receipt of such equipment from the house of a cabinet minister is not only surprising but also poses a big threat to the security of the country
 isse desh kaa koi bhi raaj chupa nahin rah paaegaa
 Whatever the Congress leaders like Digvijay Singh may say, the truth is that this matter is very serious
 dhyaan rahe ki pichley dinon is raaj se pardaa uthaa tha ki america sarkaar ne bharat main bijepi ke netaaon kii jasusi karwaai thi
 American spies keep doing such spying in other countries on the pretext of protecting the interests of their country
 yah rahasyodghatan siie ke purv contractor edward snowden ne kiya tha or is khulaase ke baad america ko kaaphi sharmindagi uthaani padi thi
 But there is nothing surprising in this because the US has a law to this effect that under which the spying agencies can go and spy on any country
 agar aisa he to bharat sarkaar ko isse nibatane ke liye kade kadam uthaane honge
 By not doing so, our security will be in danger

 Now the government will have to get to the bottom of this matter and take such steps that such incidents do not recur
 iske liye sabase jaruri he ki ham apni guptchari ko or majboot karen, use ek takat banaaen or desh ke hit main uskaa sadupyog karen
 After all, breaking of poison is poison

 khushboo ne kaha ki bijepi van nesan or van relijan kii dharna par kaam kar rahi he lekin ise kisi haalat main safal nahin hone diya jayega
 At the same time, on the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Khushboo said that that government was the most important government of the country but now the work of dividing people is being done
 khushboo ne kaha ki bijepi ko sabhi jagah samasya dikhaai detaa he
 Khushboo claimed that the BJP had a problem with her being an atheist
 khushboo ne kaha ki yadi main ghar main pork yaa bif khaauun isse bijepi ko kyon samasya he
 Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas? In response to the question raised on the Nirav Modi scam during this session, Khushboo said that the slogan of the BJP government that in the development of Sabka Saath Sabka, they are developing not only of the country but of Prime Minister Modi
 is satr ke dauraan malvika ne khushboo se poocha ki aakhir vah tripal talaak par kya sochati hai
 Khushboo said that in favor of women, they believe that no matter what religion is there, if marriage is not going on then it is necessary to end it
 haalanki malvika ne kaha ki karnataka chunaavon main bijepi kaa sirf ek naaraa he sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas
 Prakash Raj said that the BJP has nothing to do
 uski samasya he ki vah sunanaa nahin chaahati, vah bahes nahin chaahati or bijepi sirf baat karnaa chaahati he
 On celebrating Tipu Jayanti, Prakash said that he wants to celebrate secularism as the BJP is not ready for it
 use desh ko baantne kaa kaam karnaa he or vahi kaam vah karegi
 Third Session: Future of India's IT hubindia Today Karnataka Panchayat's key session was attended by Priyank Kharge, Sridhar Pabisetty and TV Mohandas Pai at the Future of India's IT Hub
 is satr kaa sanchaalan india today ke managing editor rahul kanwal ne kiya
 Compared to Delhi, Gurgaon and Hyderabad Bangalore: Mohandas Pirahul started the session by questioning the challenges facing the state's i hub
 priyank ne kaha bangaloru ab sarvice indistry ke str se upar uthakar arenddy industry kii taraf aage bad chukaa he
 Today, good work is being done in the direction of innovation in the state
 mohandas pai ne kaha ki beete kuch varshon main bangaloru main sthiti kharaab hui he
 Gurgaon, Delhi and Hyderabad are on a fast track
 beete paanch saal ke dauraan is shahar kii sthiti kamjor hui he
 Bengaluru: IT giants but facilities challenge? Sridhar Pabisetti said that in the last 2-3 years, good money was spent from the budget to strengthen the IT hub but more needs to be spent
 aaj bangaloru duniya main iti hub ke kshetra main 8wein number par he or yah badi uplabdhi he
 Today, Bengaluru has no answer in the name of giving jobs
 yahi bangaloru kii chunauti bhi he
 The way the city has the potential to provide jobs in Bangalore today, the city needs to be prepared more to support such a large population
 bangaloru ke saamne jal sankat?shridhar pabbisetty ne kaha ki sirf karnataka main iti department sabhi sectors main proective kaam kar rahaa he or aisa kisi anya rajya main dekhne ko nahin miltaa
 However, on the problems of water in the city, Rahul asked if there was a water crisis in front of the city and what the government was doing to avoid it
 priyank ne kaha ki bangaloru pension dharakon ke liye bhi sapanom kaa shahar he
 However, the city's water crisis is not as large as it is claimed
 priyank ne kaha ki sarkaar ne kai jal shroton par kaam kiya he or is sankat ko taalane ke liye rajya sarkaar taiyaar he
 Sridhar said that the former Chief Ministers have always worked to increase the IT sector in the state
 haalanki mohandas pai ne kaha ki hamen bangaloru ko or majboot karne ke liye good gavarnence kii ore badhanaa hoga
 Metro will bring major improvements in Bangalore but this work should have been completed two years ago
 lihaaja, shahar ke liye behad jaruri he ki planning samay kii jarurat ke hisaab se kii jaae
 Protest and drink tea with the Chief Minister: In Mohandasakarnataka, if anyone complains to the Chief Minister, in the evening he gets an invitation for tea from the Chief Minister's office
 vahiin anya rajyon main jaise kolkata main virodhiyon kii pitayee kar di jaati he, tamilnadu main bhi aisa hi hota he
 Hence, this is the biggest feature of Karnataka
 doosraa satr: congress banaam bijepi?india today panchayat ke ahm satr main congress netaa sachin payalat or bijepi netaa or kendriya mantri babul supriya ne shirkat kii
 The session was moderated by India Today Managing Editor Rahul Kanwal
 babul supriyo ne kaha ki rahul gandhi un jagahon par ja rahe hai jahaan beete 60 saal main koi gaya nahin he
 He is doing this on the basis of a map given to him by the party
 babul ne kaha ki hamen congress kii tarah dikhaava karne kii jarurat nahin or na hi congress ko hamaari nakal par chalanaa chahie
 Babul Supriyo said that he is not a Hippocrat
 yadi tiemasi unki party ko maarane-peetane kii baat karenge to main bhi aisi dhamkiyon kaa jawaab dene ke liye khaal khinchne kii baat kahunga
 Congress did not have the courage to implement GST: Babulababul said that Congress prepared to bring GST from decades but could not dare to implement it
 congress ko jiesti lagu karne main votbank ke nuksaan kaa dar tha
 At the same time, Babylon said that Prime Minister Narendra showed that courage and its positive impact will be seen on the country's economy
 is baat par sachin payalat ne kaha ki ham jis tarah kaa jiesti laana chaahate the use puri tarah se dhwast kar diya gaya
 GST was changed in view of the political gains in the states
 rahul congress se zyada bijepi ke bare main sochate hai- babulalingayat ke mudde par bijepi kaa kya rukh he
 Babul said that if BJP is silent on this issue, then it is our stand to say nothing on this issue
 babul ne kaha ki rahul gandhi chaar saal se bijepi ke khilaaf bol rahe hai lekin yah kabhi nahin sochaa ki aakhir kyon congress ek ke baad ek chunaav haar rahi he
 Apart from this, the BJP MP said that now the Congress was reduced to only Punjab and Karnataka, the Congress will be allout as soon as these two wickets fall
 satta main aate hi palat jaati he bijepi kii soch?jab bijepi vipaksh main baithti he to har mudde par uski raay alag rahati he
 After the government comes, it changes its views completely
 thik isi tarah aresas, hindu jaagran manch jaisi sansthaaen bhi bijepi ke satta main aane ke baad apana raag badal lete hai
 This is the dual politics of BJP
 payalat ne kaha ki pradhanmantri modi bataur mukhyamantri jiesti ke virodh main the or kendra main aane ke baad apana vichaar badal liya
 Will the Congress stand the test? At the end of this session, Rahul asked that the Congress has made a reshuffle in the organization
 iskaa kya matlab he
 Sachin Pilot said that BJP is unable to keep the people of its alliance with them
 vahiin congress ne sabhi ko saath lekar chalane kaa kaam kiya he
 The Congress is now preparing to stand the test of the public in Karnataka
 haalanki babul supriyo ne daawa kiya ki congress jhooth bol rahi he
 The ground reality in Karnataka is different and the results of the elections will bring out the truth
 pehla satr: india today 'karnataka panchayat': congress kii hogi vaapasi- mallikarjunais kaarykram kaa aagaaj karte hue india today samooh ke kansalting editor rajdeep saradesai ne karnataka ke purv mantri or congress netaa mallikarjun khadge or purv kendriya mantri or congress netaa virappa moili se sawaal-jawaab ke saath hua
 Rajdeep asked the two leaders whether the Congress would be successful in saving Karnataka? Mallikarjun Kharge said that the Congress was going to return to the state
 rajya kii congress sarkaar ne apane sabhi vaadon ko puraa kiya he isliye use bharosa he ki aagaamee chunaavon main use acha bahumat milegaa
 Will there be anti-incumbency in action? Rajdeep asked Moily whether the anti-incumbency factor would work in elections against Congress in the state? Moily said that there will be no anti-incumbency in the state
 rajdeep ne kaha ki kya rajya kaa aagaamee chunaav siddharammaiya ke naam par ladaa jayega? khadge ne kaha ki yah sawaal mahaj congress ko baantne kii koshish he
 At the same time, in the election posters in the state, giving clarification on giving preference to Siddarammaiah instead of Rahul Gandhi, Kharge said that the government is run on the programs of Congress in the state
 rajya ke mukhyamantri kendriya netritv ke kaaryakramon par bhi congress ko vaadon ko puraa kar rahi he
 Lingayat Hindus or Minorities? On being given minority status to Lingayats, Moily said that the BJP does not have any involvement on the Lingayat issue
 yah koi nai baat nahin he ki lingayat ko hindu dharm se alag dekha jaae
 Just like Buddha and Mahavira have different beliefs and are not tied to any religion
 usee tarah lingayat ko alpsankhyak darja dena uchit he
 This cannot be stopped simply because the BJP takes a different stand on this issue
 karnataka main congress ke liye 'karo yaa maro'?rajdeep ne sawaal kiya ki kya karnataka main congress ke liye karo yaa maro kii sthiti paidaa ho gai he
 Kharge said that the BJP government at the center is adopting all kinds of tactics to weaken the Congress
 idi, sibiai samet sabhi sarkari sansthaaon ko istemaal pareshaan karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 Some people are taking hold of the BJP with fear of this, but in spite of this the Congress is not afraid of these tricks and it will show it back in the state
 aresas kii counter stretage?rajdeep ne poocha ki kya kya karnataka main bijepi kaa sanghathan aapse zyada majboot ho chukaa he? isaswaal ke jawaab main khadge ne kaha ki bijepi ke liye aresas ke kaaryakarta kaam kar rahe hai
 The RSS is going from house to house and doing false propaganda among the people
 haalanki isse congress ko nuksaan nahin hoga kyonki congress ke kaaryakarta bhi ghar-ghar ja rahe hai or sidhe antim voter se baat karke aresas ke sabhi prayaason ko khokhla sabit kar rahe hai

 com / nat1v3lwdi Anna Hazare, who agitated for Jan Lokpal, is no longer alone, but Anna has found a partner
 anna kaa ek mom kaa putala banaaya gaya he, jo hoobahoo anna kii tarah he
 It is so similar, as if Anna is not one but two
 ralegan main jab manch par ekasaath dikhe do-do anna to kisi kii samaj main nahin aayaa ki asli koun he or putala koun
 If Anna had not moved, it might not have been possible to recognize him
 khud anna bhi hoobahoo apane jaisaa putala dekhakar hairaan the
 That is why Anna, sitting on the stage, repeatedly touched the mannequin
 anna ne kabhi putale ke gaal chhue to kabhi uskaa haath
 Perhaps Anna was also believing that this is an effigy made of wax, nothing else
 apane putale ke anaavaran ke baad anna ne kaha ki alag-alag kshetron main bada kaam karne waalon ke aise putalon se prerana milti he
 This wax figure of Anna has been made by Sunil Kandalur, who runs the Wax Museum in Lonavla
 hoobahoo anna kaa putala banane ke liye pehle anna se ijaajat or phir unke sharir kii maap lee gai or tab kareeb maheene bhar kii mehnat ke baad taiyaar hua ye putala
 Anna has also become wax
 haalanki ye alag baat he ki mom ke hone kaa baavjood anna ke tewaron main koi fark nahin he
 After unveiling her wax figure, Anna has said that she is also of wax and also of iron
 anna hajaare ne saaf kar diya he ki mom kaa ye putala to unke man kaa darpan he
 But those who need it also tend to bend iron
 shaayad yahi anna kii khaasiyat bhi he
 If you look like wax in front of the effigy of the wax, then as soon as you come in front of the camera, you are in your strict attitude
 apane sakht tevar dikhaane se pehle anna apana mom kaa putala banane vaale kii tarif karte rahe
 He was compared to foreign artisans
 philhal anna kaa mom kaa putala banakar taiyaar he
 Now Anna has become one or two
 lekin ye saaf he ki mom ke putale main sirf ek kami he or wo ye ki mom ke is putale main anna jaise tikhe tevar nahin hai
 The BJP Parliamentary Board met soon after voting for the presidential election
 is baithak main uparashtrapati pad ke liye kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu ko ummidavaar banane kaa faisla kiya gaya
 With the announcement of Naidu's name, it has been decided that for the first time RSS volunteers will hold the three largest constitutional posts in the country
 pichley maheene 20 may ko bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bihar ke tatkaaleen rajyapal ramnath kovind ko raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar sabko hairaan kar diya tha
 With Ramnath's name where the BJP made another attempt to sway the Dalits
 vahiin ye bhi kaha gaya ki unhen rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se jude hone kaa fal mila
 Now BJP has declared Venkaiah Naidu as the nda's Vice Presidential candidate
 wo bhi tab jab naidu modi cabinet main shahari vikaas mantralay kii ahm jimmedaari nibhaa rahe hai
 And they have important projects like Smart City, Cleanliness Campaign
 naidu ke flashbek main dekha jaae to sangharsh or garibi kii tasviir saamne aati he
 Born into a peasant family, Naidu lived in extreme poverty
 alam ye tha ki unke paas padhai tak ke liye paise nahin the
 The seriousness of his association with the RSS can be gauged from the fact that Naidu lived and slept in the Sangh's office in his young age
 parliamentry board kii baithak ke baad jab amit shah ne unke naam kaa aupchaarik elaan kiya to wo bhi naidu ke sangharsh or lagan ko yaad karte dikhe
 Amit Shah told that Naidu served the BJP since childhood
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke ateet kii baat kii jaae to unhone bhi bachapan se hi swayamsevak ke rup main kaam kiya
 Departing from Vadnagar in Gujarat, Modi reached the power of the Center and got the distinction of becoming the Prime Minister of the country
 yani tasviir bilkul saaf he
 If we look at the figures, Ramnath Kovind is almost certain to be the President
 vahiin satta paksh kaa ummidavaar hone ke naate venkaiya naidu kaa uparashtrapati bananaa bhi tay najar aa rahaa he
 Therefore, when Naidu will take over the office of Vice President after victory in the elections, the President, Vice President and Prime Minister of the country will be the volunteers of the Sangh in all three positions
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ke sahyogi dal shivasena ne aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ko raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar banane kii maang kii thi
 However, the BJP did not do so
 khud aresas ne aisi kisi sambhaavna kaa khandan kiya tha
 But the picture today, even if the RSS chief does not sit on any constitutional post, the RSS volunteers are going to occupy the three highest posts in the country

 According to him, hundreds of commission agents like him are spread across the country

 After that, the business of fake notes came to a standstill for about two months
 lekin chand maheenon main hi bangladesh main pehle do hajaar ke or phir paanch sau ke note ke block or saanche ban gaye
 After this, the cash of lakhs started being printed daily
 isse pehle ambikapur main 25 april 2018 ko gyanendra tiwari naamak ek shaks ke paas se police ne do hajaar ke 30 nakli note jabt kiye the
 This man had spent lakhs of counterfeit notes in the local market
 lekin isaki khabar kisi ko bhi kaano kaan naa thi
 Based on a secret information, the police arrested him with fake notes

 So despite demonetisation, this business flourished again as before

 They bring this amount safely to West Bengal
 phir yahanadhi keemat menvibhinn agent ko uplabdh kara dete hai
 There is no difference between fake and real notes Rajikul Sheikh has been asked during the inquiry that most people do not feel any difference between the real and fake notes of two thousand and five hundred
 ve sirf color or ankon ko dekh kar note kaa istemaal karte hai
 Hence fake notes are easily consumed in the market
 haal hi main chhattisgarh ke aadha darjan rashtriyakrut bainko ne saath lakh ke nakli note raipur police ko muhaiyaa karaae the
 These fake notes came to the banks in circulation
 lekin kin graahakon ke jariye nakli note bainkon tak pahunche unki shinakhti nahin ho pai thi

 The boy also revealed his address
 lekin is par police vaale kaa jawaab chaunkaane vaala tha
 He said, 'these papers will not work

 On this, the boy took out his voter ID card and showed it

 PM Modi's dream and when Prime Minister Narendra Modi went to Guwahati recently, he gave the mantra to the policemen to be smart
 smart police yani takanic se las
 But eight years ago in 2006 itself, Delhi Police, considered the smartest police in the country, started the exercise of smartness
 ek software takanic ko develop kiya gaya or naam diya gaya CRIS
 Chris means to scan the thumb through digital technology and check the database in minutes to see if the criminal is in front
 is takanic ko launch karte vakt tatkaaleen police kamishnar keke paul ne bataaya tha ki is computericed remote aaidentification of suspects (kris) ke system main 1 lakh 60 hajaar se adhik aparaadhiyon ke finger print kaa database he
 What is Chris's current reality? Actually, the technique was good so it was captured hands-on
 kai rajyon ne is pahal kii saraahna bhi kii
 Many cases were solved with the help of Chris, many big incidents were stopped before the incident took place
 yani kris safalataa kii ore chal padaa
 But if we consider these are the countries where the cost of data is more than life
 baat chaahe bilaspur ke nasbandi camp kii ho yaa gurudaspur main ankhon ke oparation shivi kii
 In the game of statistics, schemes are defeated and millions of crores of rupees are lost
 aankadon ke changul main takanikaankadon kii charchaa isliye ki jis kris takanic kaa istemaal aparaadhiyon kii pahchaan ke liye hona tha, asal main maujuuda daur main vah bhi aankadon kii bhent chadh chukaa he
 This real incident of forcibly taking a common man to the police station at three in the morning in Mukherjee Nagar area is the hallmark of this
 yani raat main sadak par nikalnaa he or agar aapke paas koi saadhan nahin he, paidal chal rahe hai to 10 minute police thane main gujaarne honge yah tay maniye
 Then it does not matter whether you have a passport or an Aadhaar card
 naam nahin bataane kii shart par ek police adhikari ne bataaya, 'ham kya karen
 The target has to be met
 kai baar apradhi bhi pakad main aate hai
 But yes, common people also have to bother
 majaburi he
 'every third day, the ATM guard crisscrossing the streets late at night to find out the truth of this game and discover that the most disturbing ATM and other guards are there
 aise hi ek guard ramshankar ne bataaya, 'ham maheenon se yahaan roj raat main baithte hai
 Policemen are now beginning to identify
 lekin har tisare din gaadi par bithakar thane le jate hai
 Chris to investigate
 'dilachasp yah he ki target puraa karne kaa yah khel sirf mukherjee nagar ilaake main nahin, balki rajdhani ke anya duusare ilaakon main bhi chal rahaa he
 Though there are some remote devices on this side too, due to the small number of people, people are often taken to the police station for a CRIS test
 pulicekarmi apni vyathaa sunaate hue kehete hai, 'ham kai baar logon se request karte hai ki sarpot kiijie
 It takes five minutes to go to the police station
 'kya kehete hai adhikariaankadon kii is bajigiri par koi khulkar bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Small officers refuse to speak when the phone is installed in the police station, while big officers do not pick up the phone
 haalanki kuch pulicekarmi sweekaar karte hai ki aisa ho rahaa he
 That is, in this game of statistics, a good technique has become a joke
 100 karod se adhik kii aabaadi vaale is desh main CRIS ek shuruyaat he, smart police kii
 Hopefully Prime Minister Narendra Modi's smart police will not get involved in this statistics game because when there is such a fate in the country's capital, it will be difficult to stop the misuse of technology in rural areas or small towns
