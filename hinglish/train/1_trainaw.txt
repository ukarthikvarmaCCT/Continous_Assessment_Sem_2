 In this way, BJP also won the ninth seat and Anil Aggarwal won
 isse pehle bijepi ke aath vidhayak or sapa pratyaashee jaya bachchan aasaani se jeet gai
 Jaya received a total of 38 votes
 counting ke dauraan chunaav ayog kaa faisla, bijepi or bispi vidhayakon ke 1-1 vot radd kar die gaye
 Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party MLA accused BJP agent of tearing down votes
 chunaav ayog ne paryvekshak se CCTV dekh kar maamle kaa pareekshan karne ko kaha
 If the votes are torn then the FIR will be on the tearing
 aapako bataa den ki upi main rajyasabha chunaav ke liye pehla vot sapa ke shivpal yadav ne daalaa
 Objection on ballot paper arose in UP Rajya Sabha election when countingcounting started
 is vajah se chunaav ayog ne countingrok di
 It was alleged that Nitin Aggarwal and Anil Singh did not show their votes to the Authorize agent
 isaki shikaayat bispi ne chunaav ayog se kii he or isi vajah se counting roki gai he
 The BSP and SP had demanded the cancellation of the vote of both the mlas
 chunaav ayog ke aadesh ke baad hi countingashuru hui
 At the same time, according to sources, bjp's partner party Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party MLA Kailash Nath Sonkar has also done cross voting
 raja bhaiya par bana rahaa suspenceshuru se hi haa or na ke bich raja bhaiya kaa bayaan aayaa ki main vot daalane jaaoongaa
 However, even after casting his vote, there was a lot of suspense on who he voted for
 iske peeche raja bhaiya kaa aacharan rahaa
 First Raja Bhaiya said that i will vote for Samajwadi Party and Jaya Bachchan, neither vote for BSP nor vote for BJP
 iske baad nirdaleey vidhayak raja bhaiya or vinod saroj ne vot daale
 However, after casting his vote, Raghuraj Pratap Singh met Yogi and said that the meeting happened due to courtesy
 vot usee ko diya, jisase vaada kiya tha
 At the same time, Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav tweeted and thanked Raja Bhaiya for his support
 khub chalaa aankadon kaa ganitsutron ke mutabik voting ke dauraan kai baar nai ranneeti bani
 There was talk in the middle that Raja Bhaiya will no longer vote
 darasal raja bhaiya ne apana vot samaajawaadee party ke liye rakhaa he or 37wein voter ke taur apana vot daalane vaale hai
 But now a candidate needs only 36 votes to win
 aise main raja bhaiya kaa 37 main vot kaa kuch pratishat basapa ko ja saktaa he
 That is why it was believed that Raja Bhaiya would not vote
 vahiin sutron ke mutabik bijepi ne rajyasabha ke liye badi ranneeti banaai thi
 According to the mathematics of votes, BJP will not get the votes of two mlas
 aise main ab rajyasabha sadsy ke chayan ke liye 36 voton kii jarurat hogi
 That means there will be a total of 398 votes in UP
 haalanki 400 vot pade
 The ban was on the voting of two mlas even before the commencement of the election, the High Court had stayed the vote of Mukhtar Ansari in the second case also
 isse pehle unhen shuukravaar ko ho rahe rajyasabha chunaav main vot daalane ke liye nichali court se anumati mili thi
 At the same time, Mukhtar was also allowed to cast his vote from the Gangster Court in Ghazipur last evening
 lekin upi sarkaar kii arji par elahabaad hoicourt ne roak laga di
 a single bench of Justice Rajul Bhargava has prohibited Mukhtar from casting his vote
 jail main band kaidi ko vot dene kaa adhikaar nahin hone ke aadhaar par roak lagaai gai he
 He also did not give his party's support during the election, SP MLA Nitin Aggarwal said that Samajwadi Party gives preference to the entertainers of the society, whereas the bjp's society

 He said that all our parties have connections with mlas
 yah jarur he ki 2 vidhayak hamase milane aae the, lekin main samaajawaadee party ke vidhayakon ke bare main kah saktaa hum ki koi nahin tuutegaa
 Even before the election, the BSP received a setback, 2 more contacts with Anil Singh and MLA BJP, there was big news from Uttar Pradesh before the election

 Apart from Anil Singh, two more BSP mlas were in touch with BJP
 mukhyamantri awaas par hui vidhayak dal kii baithak main anil singh ko bhi dekha gaya tha

 How is Counting in Rajya Sabha Election? There is a fixed formula for Rajya Sabha election, divided by the total number of members of the Legislative Assembly with one addition in the vacant seats
 nishkarsh main bhi ek jodne par jo sankhya aati he
 The same number of votes a member needs to win a Rajya Sabha election
 agar upi kaa udhaaharan liya jaae to 10 siton main 1 joda jaae to yoga hua 11
 Now dividing 403 by 11 then it comes to 36
 63
 If 1 is added to it, the sum is 37
 63
 That is, a member needs the support of 38 mlas to win the UP Rajya Sabha elections
 haalanki chunki ek vidhayak kaa nidhan ho chukaa he isliye yahaan 37 vidhayakon ke samarthan se hi rajyasabha ummidavaar kii jeet tay ho jaaegi

 Opposition is trying to unite for the Maharashtra Assembly elections, but Sharad Pawar's party NCP has put the fifty-fifty formula in front of the Congress, sensing the opportunity
 vidhansabha chunaav main seat bantwaare ko lekar mumbai main hui baithak main ensipi ne saaf kar diya he ki use congress ke baraabar siten chahie
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the Congress will agree on the NCP formula
 ensipi ke ek netaa ne naam na chhapane kii shart par bataaya ki loksabhaa chunaav ke baad paristhitiyaan badal chuki hai
 The NCP has outperformed the Congress in the last two Lok Sabha elections
 is baar bhi ham congress se kam siton par ladakar unase zyada siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahe hai
 In such a situation, we should get assembly seats equal to the Congress
 bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav main congress or ensipi milakar chunavi maidan main utre the
 Out of the total 42 parliamentary seats in Maharashtra, Congress 25, NCP 20 and other allies contested 3 seats
 congress 25 loksabhaa siton par chunavi maidan main utari thi, jinamein se mahaj 1 seat par jeet mili thi
 While NCP won 4 by contesting 20 seats
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main bhi donon partiyon ne saath chunaav ladaa tha
 Then NCP could win 4 seats and Congress 2
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad congress jahaan post he to ensipi ke hausale buland hai
 In such a situation, NCP is reminding the Congress of the seat sharing formula in the 2004 assembly elections
 2004 main ensipi ko congress se zyada siten mili thi
 Although the congress-ncp alliance was formed in 1999, the seat could not be agreed between the two in the 2014 assembly elections
 iske chalate donon partiyon ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa or iskaa bijepi ko jabardast phayda mila

 a tough contest can be seen in the IPL match between Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Mumbai Indians (MI) on Thursday evening at m Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru
 donon timen ipel main dhamaakedaar parformens ke liye jaani jaati hai
 Both teams have played 1–1 matches so far in Season 12 of the IPL and both have lost in their first match
 aise main donon timen majbootee ke saath aaj maidan main utarana chahengi
 In such a situation, Mumbai Indian captain Rohit Sharma and RCB captain Virat Kohli can make some changes in their respective teams
 RCB se navdeep kii ho sakati he chuttiarsibi ke spin gendbaaj navdeep saini kaa debyue isi IPL sijan main hui he
 Navdeep proved to be the team's most expensive bowler in his debut match against Chennai Super Kings
 unhone bina wicket liye chaar over main sabase zyada 24 ran die
 In such a situation, Washington Sundar is a better option than Navdeep near Kohli
 sundar na keval deth overs main achche shot lagane main sakasham hai balki wo power play main behatar genjabaji bhi kar sakate hai
 In such a situation, if Kohli gives him a chance in today's match in place of Navdeep, it will not be surprising
 chennai super kings ke khilaaf is match main navdeep ke alaava chahal ne 4 over main mahaj 6 ran die or ek wicket bhi jhatka
 At the same time, Moin Ali took 1 wicket for 19 runs in 4 overs and Umesh Yadav gave 13 runs in 3 overs
 iske alaava mohammad siraaj ne do over main 5 ran dekar ek wicket liya tha
 Mayank Markandey can be found in MI instead of mi's swing master Rasikh Salaam in today's match
 jammu kashmir se aane vaale 17 varshiya rasikh salaam dilli ke khilaaf khele gaye sijan ke apane pehle match main ballebaajon par lagaam lagane main vifal rahe
 He proved to be the most expensive for MI
 unhone chaar over main bina kisi safalataa ke sabase zyada 42 ran die
 MI captain Rohit Sharma can rely on Mayank Markandey, the star leg spinner of the previous IPL
 mayank ne pichley apiel ke 14 maichon 15 wicket jatke the
 With signs of Malinga's return, MI could also turn into fast bowling with spin
 aise main IPL ke star gendbaaj or yorker king lasith malinga ko team main jagah mil sakati he
 This is because the team needs a Death Over Specialist bowler and Mitchell mclaghan proved too expensive in the last over in the last match
 unhone 4 over main 3 wicket jarur chatkaaye lekin ant ke overon main unki gend kii jamkar dhunaai hui or kul 40 ran die
 Malinga could thus be a better option for Rohit, who along with Jasprit Bumrah, can strengthen the team in the end overs
 malinga dwaara over ke bich gend ke saath kiya jane vaala prayog team ke liye phydemand sabit ho saktaa he

 america or japan kar rahe virodumerica or japaanne china ke netritv main ban rahe is bank kaa virodh kiya he
 Recently, the US had pressurized many countries of Asia, including Australia, to not join this bank
 gauratlab he ki america or kuch samarthit pashchimi deshon kaa maananaa he ki china ke samarthan se ban rahaa 'asia bank'imf or world bankjaisi sansthaaon kaa pratidwandi ban jayega
 Therefore the US and Japan have refused to join this bank

 The World Bank said there is a difference of $ 1,000-1,500 billion in spending on infrastructure in emerging markets and low-income countries
 AIIB kaa prastaav aktubar 2013 main china ke rashtrapti shi jinping ne kiya tha
 a year later, 21 Asian countries including China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Singapore signed the agreement to set up the bank
 sachin tendulkar ne mangalvaar ko perth trikoniya ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa ke duusare match main 16waan ran banane ke saath hi srilanka ke khilaaf 3000 ran puure kiye
 He is the first batsman in the world to do this feat
 tendulkar kaa yah srilanka ke khilaaf 80waan match he or unhone apane is priy pratidwandvi ke khilaaf lagbhag 45
 Has scored at an average of 50
 srilanka ke alaava australia duusari aisi team he jiske khilaaf sachin ne 3000 se adhik vanade ran banaaye hai
 He has scored over 2000 runs against Pakistan and South Africa
 srilanka ke khilaaf tendulkar ke baad sarvaadhik ran pakistan ke injamaam ul haq (2265 ran) ne banaaye hai
 This is Tendulkar's 80th match against Sri Lanka and he scored around 45 against his beloved rival
 50 ke ausat se ran banaaye hai
 Apart from Sri Lanka, Australia is the second team against which Sachin has scored more than 3000 ODI runs
 vah pakistan or dakshin africa ke khilaaf 2000 se adhik ran bana chuke hai
 Pakistan's inzamam-ul-haq (2265 runs) has scored the most runs after Tendulkar against Sri Lanka
 chhattisgarh main aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar bastar ke sabhi jilon main chunaav kii taiyaariyaan joro par he to duusari ore kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ke kaaryakarta andruni ilaakon main prachaar karne nahin ja rahe hai
 The biggest reason for this is the threat of Naxalites in which it was clearly stated that if the workers come in, they will be killed
 uskaa hi nateeja he ki bijapur sukamaadantewadaor narayanpur sahit sambhag ke saaton jilon main raajnneetik dalon kaa prachaar prasar kasbaai ilaakon tak hi simit rah gaya he
 Neither party flags nor pamphlets are distributed in the interiors
 haalanki, gramin yah kah rahe hai naksaliyon kaa khauf unke gaanv main nahin he phir bhi raajnneetik dal ke sadsy abhi tak un tak kyon nahin pahunch rahe iskaa jawaab unke paas bhi nahin he
 On the other hand, activists of political parties are not able to reach the rural areas
 aise main unhen bhi yah dar he ki kahin un par naksali hamalaa naa ho jaae
 Workers are afraid of going to the interiors of Bijapur
 vahi sukama or dantewada sahit samvedansheel kshetron main amuman sthiti yahi he
 State Forest Minister and BJP candidate from Bijapur Mahesh Gagda also admit that it is risky to spread the campaign in the interior areas
 lihaaja kaaryakarta apane str par logon ke bich pahunch rahe hai
 Congress candidate Vikram Mandavi also believes that there is a danger in spreading the campaign but only after reaching the public, they will get votes
 lihaaja paramilitary forces kii madad se ye un gaanv tak pahunch rahe hai
 Overall, the activists or candidates of any political party are not able to reach the areas where the Naxalites have a separate state and the Naxalites have openly declared a boycott of the elections due to the constant Naxallee in Bastar
 100 percent voting cannot be expected
 vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle lagaataar ho rahe hamale
 
 
 The state is in awe of two Naxalite attacks before the first phase of voting for the assembly elections in Chhattisgarh
 naksaliyon ne teen din ke bheetar 2 baar bade hamale kiye
 The attack was first conducted in Bijapur on 27 October and then the Doordarshan team was targeted in Dantewada
 aapako bataa den ki 12 november ko chhattisgarh main 18 siton par matdaan hona he, ye sabhi vahi siten hai jahaan par naksaliyon kaa prabhaav rahata he
 This is the reason that security in these areas has been greatly strengthened
 iske baavjood naksali apni karatuut se baj nahin aa rahe hai
 Naxalites have always opposed democratic elections and now this is the reason why they are adopting this kind of manipulation to prevent people from casting their votes
 shrivats nevatiyamark jukerbarg 2010 main julian asanje or hamid karaji jaison ko peeche chhod kar time patrika ke 'saal kii shakhsiyat' bane the
 Facebook was six years old and Zuckerberg 26K at the time
 donon chote the or achche lagate the
 At that time we used to ask Zuckerberg the simple question: does social media affect reality or does it reflect it? Can we be 'addicted' to Facebook? Will social media make us alienate from society? Today Zuckerberg is forced to answer less intuitive questions
 kya fasebuk ne 2016 ke raashtrapati chunaav main donald trup ke khel main madad kii thi? kya hamaara data unke paas surakshit he? online ghrinaa par ankush lagane ke liye kya upaay kiye gaye hai?fasebuk, twitor or instagram jaise soshal media plateform apane shuruaati daur main ek nae tarah ke ashavad ke agradoot the
 The thinking was that if we were all using the same apps on the same smartphone, then the world would definitely be on par
 hamaare dharmik, rajnatik or saanskrithik matbhedon ke bandhan deele padenge or ham ek saahsee nai duniya main jeena seekhenge jahaan ham zyada chizon ko pasand karenge, zyada baaten saajha karenge or kam nafrat karenge
 Unfortunately, these dreams have now faded
 2014 main jab baraak obama ne aais backet chalange sweekaar kiya tha to hamen un par hansi aati thi, lekin uske chand saal ke bheetar hamaari chintaaen gahraane lagi hai
 We are worried about the social networking game Blue Whale Challenge, which has forced many players to even commit suicide
 2012 main arab spring ne hamen vishwaas dilaayaa tha ki soshal media duniya main loktantr ko failaane main madadgaar ho saktaa he, lekin 2018 aate-aate hamaare paas saboot the ki fasebuk loktantr ko palitha laga rahaa he
 If we were to map the recent history of social media on a timeline, the most important event would undoubtedly be the Cambridge Analytica scam of 2018
 2016 ke raashtrapati chunaav ke dauraan roosiyon ko dushprachaar abhiyaan chalaane kii kshamta pradaan karne ke aaropon kaa pehle se saamana kar rahe fasebuk ke bare main pataa chalaa ki usne trump ke prachaar abhiyaan main lagi rajnatik paramarshdatri form cambridge analitica ke ek shodhakarta ko 8
 Had given personal figures of 7 crore Facebook account holders
 bataate hai, trump kii team ne apane pramukh samarthakon ko prabhavit karne ke liye taiyaar kiye gaye vigyapanon main fasebuk aankadon kaa upyog kiya tha jinaki koi jaanch nahin hui thi
 Facebook's stock price fell more than 24 per cent after news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in 2018, and the company's market value fell by $ 134 billion in the process
 jukerbarg ne bharosa diya tha ki fasebuk ke suraksha protocol ko sudhara jayega, lekin vaastavik nuksaan ho chukaa tha
 There has been no change in the role of Facebook
 ham iskaa upyog apni baton par logon kaa samarthan or anumodan paane, apane chitron ko post karne or logon ke sampark main rahane ke liye karte hai, lekin dhandhon ke liye fasebuk asaadhaaran kaam karata he
 It gives them a way to reach our priorities and sudden desires
 companiyaan ab hamaari online gatividhiyon kii jaankaree paane ke liye bhi boli laga sakati hai
 While advertisers have helped build Zuckerberg's $ 500 billion empire, of course, it also makes sense why the CEO of Facebook would like to reserve his best innovations for him
 lekin vigyapandaataaon se alag ham logon ke liye, hamaari kharidari karne ke tareeke ko prabhavit karnaa ek baat he, or hamaare vot karne ke tareeke ko prabhavit karnaa duusari baat
 Twitter has now banned political ads, but Zuckerberg has insisted that "censoring politicians or news is not the job of private companies
" '' fasebuk se prasaarit soochnaaon ke bare main saaf jaankaree dene se inkaar karne vaale jukerbarg chaahate hai ki unhen keval sandeshvahak ke rup main dekha jaae
 As if they wanted to say "target the messenger, not me
" '' apni pratiraksha main unki is daleel ko loktantr main swatantra abhivyakti ke siddhant se bhi vaidhata milti he
 When the world is now asking Zuckerberg to behave like a responsible publisher, his defense rests on two arguments
 ek yah ki fasebuk koi prakaashak nahin, yah upyogkartaaon ko unki ichha ke anusaar saamagree chhapane kii anumati bhar detaa he
 Secondly and more importantly, the blame is not in Facebook, but in us
 sampark or sanchaar main sakasham karne vaali takanic die jane ke baad hamane iskaa upyog dhamkaane, chintaaen paidaa karne or nafrat failaane ke liye kiya he
 Last year, it came to light that not only rumors of cow slaughter, child abduction and organ trade were spreading on whatsapp in India, but people were also beating up and beating up suspects while reacting to them
 ravishankar prasad ne is par fasebuk ko dapatate hue kaha tha ki farji khabaron se nibatna koi rocket science nahin he, lekin whatsap ke sanchaalkon ke paas is samasya ke dikhaawati samaadhaan hi the
 In October this year, the Indian government announced that it would toughen the rules regarding social media apps as they are causing unforeseen obstacles to the country's "democratic political system"
 centre ne supreme court main kaha ki fasebuk, twitor, utyub, tiktaoc or instagram jaise plateformon ko unke upyogkartaaon kii saajha kii jane vaali saamagree ke liye javabdeh hona chahie
 But this argument stands on slippery ground
 fasebuk ko har upyogkarta kii post satyapit karne ke liye majaboor kiya gaya hota to mitu andolan jangal kii aag jaisaa kabhi na fail paata
 Social media, especially in India, could legitimize a large community of persecuted people and their confessions
 ajeeb baat yah bhi he ki isane aise peediton ko daraane vaale bhi paidaa kiye
 Along with gaining the courage to bring the oppressors to the fore, all the victims faced threats of rape by elements they had never even seen
 kuch soshal media samalochakon ne is sthiti kaa dosha ham upyogkartaaon ke iskaa bahut ''aadi'' hone par daalaa he, lekin maansik swasthya kii chintaa karne vaale ye shubhechhu aksar bhul jate hai ki samay ke saath twitor, fasebuk or instagram ne inase itar kisi sambhaavna ko lagbhag khatm kar diya he
 Now ways of countering hatred must develop from within these indispensable platforms
 eks naam kiek soshal media accountholder ke saamne ai mushkilon se ise thik se samajhen
 a few thousand people follow this personality on Facebook and Instagram
 log uske bataae mechap tips ko gambhirtha se lete hai
 The reviews on youtube, released on Friday, seem a bit offbeat and funny
 ye gatividhiyaan uski soshal media haisiyat ko badhaati hai
 She occasionally reposts her comments on her video on social media
 pichley hafte usne instagram par bataaya ki uski samikshaon se pareshaan kisi vyakti ne use likhaa tha, ''main bhagwaan se prarthana karuunga ki tumhaara bhi priyanka reddy kii tarah gangrape ho or jinda jala diya jaae
 "now the orthodox can advise him to withdraw from social media
 par mujhe yakeen he, vah aapako bataaegi ki yah koi vikalp nahin—uski aajeevika is par nirbhar he
 Many women with similar intentions are threatened every day — on Twitter and Facebook
 par haa, fasebuk or instagram ne udhyamita kii ek nai bhaavana protsaahit kii he, or, twitor ne saarvajanik bahes main vyapak bhagidaari kii sambhaavnaaen paidaa kii hai, lekin teenon hi javabdehi se bachate hai
 If these companies did not find a way to end the hatred and rumors, then we have to find a way out
 jukerbarg ko pataa hona chahie ki soshal media par swarg or narak ke daravaaje agal-bagal or ek-se dikhne vaale hai
 It is their job to ensure that the other is locked

 But recently one of his videos has gone viral, which is really shocking

 During this time, when a fan touched him and asked him to take a selfie, Ranu Mandal erupted
 ranu mandal (ranu Mondal) fain par unhen tach karne ke liye baras padi
 In the viral video, it can be seen clearly how Ranu Mandal is getting angry on the fan
 Ok, so she didn't like someone touching her
 And everyone's automatically assumed that her 'overnight' fame got to her head
 Ever stopped to reason otherwise? 1
 What is she's just having a bad day? How nice are any of us, on our bad days? 2
 So what if her fame was 'overnight'? Maybe that's what she was destined for! You clearly didn't pay a dime for it
 3
 Celebs throw tantrums all the time! Don't you still pay to go watch them play a role, for which they're paid 10 times your annual income? 4
 So what if she slept on footpaths? How does that make her any less of a human? To have bad days or just be plain moody? ▫️to the men insulting women because of your male ego
 ▫️to the women insulting other women, just because they make you feel insecure
 thoseto those of you fighting the roadside vendors for a discount, but quietly paying twice the price at a store
 ▫️to those of you who step out of religious places, only to gossip about someone who you saw there
 thoseto those of you who'd rather feed a statue, than a hungry mouth
 ▫️to those of you who cannot digest the fact that someone else is living a better life than you are
 Who gave you the right to judge her, without looking at yourselves first? 
 Media and words - when misused, can be more lethal than a weapon
 Stop assuming stuff about someone you don't even know on a personal level
 Everyone is dealing with their own shit
 Celeb or not

 The film itself has started a heated debate on a subject like sperm donation
 is par bamushkil hi kabhi baat hoti thi
 This is happening at a time when sperm numbers and motility are decreasing in reproductive age in many men due to lifestyle-related diseases and stresses
 bedi kahati hai ki unke clinics main aane vaale banjhapan ke maamalon main kam se kam aadhe 'mail factor' kaa nateeja hote hai
 She says, '50% of impotent men do not have sperm cells at all and the rest half suffer from decreased sperm count and reduced motility

 ashish kehete hai, 'main vah aadmi bananaa chahta hum, jo niqusantan jodon ke aansu ponch detaa he
 Similarly, Chandigarh-based hotelier Brajeshwar Singh Guron, who is looking for the bride of his dreams, also considers sperm donation as blood donation
 ve kehete hai, 'raktadan anmol jivan ko bachaane main madad karata he to sperm daan se nae jivan kaa janm hota he

 Dr
 bedi kahati hai, 'aap puri tarah saavdhaan nahin rah sakate
 They cite examples where semen samples of patients were found from local diagnostic laboratories where there was no facility to wash sperm cells or keep them in a freeze state
 sahagal kehete hai ki maanav nishechan daan koi hansi-khel nahin he
 He says, "taking samples from donors without investigation or incomplete examination can lead to dangerous and genetic abnormalities
" ' iske alaava visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki ek khaas kshetra or khaas saamaajik samooh main badi sankhya main mahilaon ko garbhadhaaran karaane ke liye ek hi donor ke veery kaa baar-baar prayog jin pool main gadabadi paidaa kar saktaa he

 jabaki, centre main narendra modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad ab tak saat baar raashtrapati shashan lagaaya ja chukaa he, jo ki desh ke chaar rajyon main laga he
 However, since independence, President's rule has been imposed about 126 times in different states of India

 At that time, Sharad Pawar was the Chief Minister
 aise main unke paas bahumat tha, haalanki raajnneetik halaat bigadane par vidhansabha bhang kar di gai thi
 In such a situation, President's rule was in force in the state for about 112 days from 17 February to 8 June 1980

 The governor then asked the Shiv Sena to form the government, but Uddhav Thackeray also could not submit a majority support letter on the stipulated deadline
 iske badencipi ko sarkaar banane ke liye nimantrandia, lekin party ne samarthan patr dene ke liye teen din kaa vakt maanga
 The result was that the Governor recommended imposition of President's rule in the state, which was approved by the Cabinet and approved by President Ram Nath Kovind
 narendra modi sarkaar main lage raashtrapati shashanbataa den ki centre main narendra modi sarkaar ke aane se baad maharashtra pehla rajya nahin he, jab kisi rajya main raashtrapati shashan laga ho
 Since 2014, President's rule has been implemented in four states of the country
 isamen maharashtra, uttarakhand, arunanchal pradesh or jammu-kashmir rajya bhi shaamil hai
 Uttarakhand has imposed President's rule twice in the year 2016 after the coming of the Modi government

 President's rule came after the first split in the Congress and the second time in May, President's rule was imposed in the state again due to the defections of mlas
 congress is maamle ko lekar hai court pahunch gai, jahaan se tatkaaleen harish ravat sarkaar ko raahat mili thi
 The court gave its decision against imposition of President's rule
 arunachal pradeshmodi sarkaar main hi arunachal pradesh saal 2016 main 26 dinon ke raashtrapati shashan laga tha

 jammu-kashmir main do barrashtrapati shashanjammu-kashmir main june 2018 main bijepi ne pidipi ke netritv vaali sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya tha
 Due to this, Mehbooba Mufti resigned from the post of CM, after which President's rule was imposed in the state
 raashtrapati shashan ke dauraan hi rajya main artical 370 ko radd kar diya gaya or rajya se vishesh rajya kaa darja bhi waapas le liya gaya he
 However even before this, due to the failure in government formation after a fractured decision in the 2015 assembly elections, the central government in Jammu and Kashmir was implemented in the state

 in chaar saalon main bijepi desh hi nahin balki duniya kii sabase badi party banakar ubhari he
 Prior to 2014, the BJP-NDA ruled only eight states of the country, but the political map of the country has changed after Narendra Modi came to power
 70 fisadi rajyon main bhagava rang chadh chukaa he, jabaki congress ke mahaj teen rajyon main mukhyamantri hai
 Modi won election-by-election in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, with the help of Modi wave, BJP fed lotus and painted the entire country in saffron
 2014 main pehali baar sansad pahunche narendra modi ne pradhanmantri kii kursi sambhalate hi 'congress mukt bharat' kaa naaraa diya
 Assembly elections were held in 21 states after 2014, in most of the states, BJP won the political battle and formed the government
 philhal desh ke 20 rajyon main bijepi-endie kii sarkaar hai
 In Kamalmodi Raj, feeding these states under Modi Raj, BJP was successful in forming government in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal, Meghalaya, Tripura, Nagaland
 bihar main bijepi ko haar mili thi lekin kareeb dedh saal baad hi uskaa gathbandhan jediu ke saath hua or is tarah bijepi yahaan bhi satta main aa gai
 The government of other parties in 7 states, in the recently held elections in Karnataka, BJP formed the government by winning the most seats but due to the decrease of 7 seats in the majority, BS Yeddyurappa resigned before the power test
 jabaki modi ke raaj main bijepi ko punjab, pashchim bengal, dilli, tamilnadu, puducheri, odisha or kerala main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Leaving Punjab and Puducherry, other parties won in other states
 desh ke 7 rajyon main anya dalon kii sarkaar hai
 bjp-ruled states of Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Manipur, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Tripura, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Sikkim Is in inamen se kai jagah bijepi kii sarkaar he or kai jagah anya dalon ke saath milakar endie kii sarkaar bani he
 The Congress left in four states, the state of the 132-year-old Congress that once ruled the entire country, is today that it has been reduced to only 4 states
 2014 main 14 rajyon main congress kii sarkaar thi
 But one state after another has been slipped out of its hands and reduced from 14, now only 4 states have a government of the party
 congress sirf 2 rajyon (mizoram, punjab) or ek centre shasit pradesh puducheri kii satta par kabiz he
 Apart from this, Congress will also be a junior partner in JDS leader Kumaraswamy's government by winning 78 seats in Karnataka
 congress hi nahin, kshetreey dalon par bhi padi baribite chaar saal main bijepi ne naa sirf congress ko haraaya he balki kshetreey dalon par bhi wo baari padi he

 sankat main fanse sharaab kaarobaari vijay maalya ke samarthan main utarate hue united bruwarij (ubiel) ke prabandhan ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki vah ubiel ke chairman pad par bane rahenge
 However, there are reports that the Enforcement Directorate has attached Mallya's shares in the company
 company ke nideshak chug yogendra paal ne aaj yahaan salanaa aamasabha kii adhyakshata karne ke baad kaha ki ubiel ne is bare main bharat ke purv mukhya nyaayadhish se kanoonee raay maangi he
 Pal said that under the law, Mallya would continue to be the chairman of the company
 tippaniyan He further stated that as of now the Enforcement Directorate has not attached any of the assets and shares of UBL and Mallya has not been disqualified to remain the Chairman of the company
 prabandhan maalya ke samarthan main tab aage aayaa he jabaki is tarah kii khabaren hai ki ubiel main unke share idi ne kurk kar die hai

 ) Company director Chugh Yogendra Pal said after presiding over the annual general meeting here today that UBL has sought a legal opinion from the former Chief Justice of India in this regard
 paal ne kaha ki kanoon ke tahat maalya company ke chairman bane rahenge
 The comments unhone aage kaha ki abhi tak pravartan nideshaalay ne ubiel kii koi bhi sampatti or share kurk nahin kiye hai or maalya company kaa chairman bane rahane ke ayogy nahin hue hai
 The management has come forward in support of Mallya when there are reports that the ED has attached his shares in UBL

 ) On the occasion of Eid this year, we saw Salman Khan's wrestling and now on Christmas, Aamir Khan has shown the stakes of this game
 jab se 'sultan' or 'dangal' kii mekking kii khabaren ain, tabhi se aamir khan or salmaan khan kii filmon kii tulana shuru ho gai thi
 Then, after the tremendous box office success of 'sultan', the success figures of 'dangal' were further noticed
 ab kamai ke 'dangal' aamir hamaare 'sultan' ko patkani de pate hai yaa nahin, ye to jald pataa lag jayega
 But before that we know what makes 'dangal' and 'sultan' different in the film making and alike - Kushti's bets - Peach Aamir and Salman Khanki films are both based on the wrestling game and the desire to win medals for the country
 lekin treetment bilkul alag he
 'sultan' is the story of a wrestler finding himself
 vahiin, 'dangal' main ek pita apane sapane puure karne ke liye betiyon ko hunarmand banaata he
 Now as far as the matter of showing wrestling is concerned, in this technique Amir's film falls on the same
 in 5 baton kii vajah se dekhen aamir khan kii 'dangal'bhale hi aamir ne bas film kii shuruyaat ke kuch seen main hi kushti kii he lekin baad main jis tarah vah apni betiyon ko kushti karavaate or sikhaate hai, usamen takanic behatar dikhi he
 This is the reason why Fatima Sana Shaikh's stakes in 'dangal' look more real and exciting than Anushka Sharma's scripts in 'sultan'
 'dangal' par salmaan ne aamir ko kaha - i Hate youstara power'sultan' kii packaging acchhee thi lekin is par kahin na kahin salmaan kaa star states haaavee tha
 This thing is not in 'dangal'
 aamir khan film main bas mahavir singh phogot hi hai
 
 
 a character
 yahi vajah he ki jahaan salmaan kii 'sultan' main entry or har patkani par siti bajati he, vahiin 'dangal' main film kaa ant pataa hone ke baavjood ankhen screen par tiki rahati hai
 Know how is 'dangal' Director's catch 'dangal' and 'sultan', both of the films directors have no major hits before them
 aise main donon ne khan stars ke saath aatmavishvaas se kaam kiya he
 But 'sultan' director Ali Abbas Zafar has made the film more exciting and tight
 jabaki 'dangal' ke diarector nitesh tiwari ne imoshans or kushti to bharpoor dikhaai lekin film ko real banane ke chakkar main romaanch thodaa kam kar diya
 Wrestling not only won the heart but who in the 'sultan' act should not have raised this question now, but if the films are compared, this point will not be missed
 salmaan to salmaan hai or film rivyus main kaha bhi gaya tha ki ye unke kariyar kii best film rahi he
 See who reached the screening of 'dangal'
 
 
 vahiin aamir khan 'dangal' main aamir khan bas tabhi lagate hai, jab aap unke kaan dekhte hai
 Otherwise, as he has lived the character of Mahavir Singh Phogat in the entire film, it proves that the 'sultan' of the emotions on screen is the same! Dangal Dangal or Sultan
 
 
 'sultan' kaa mujeec vishaal-shekhar ne diya tha
 According to the story, there was more romantic angle in it
 jag ghumya, 440 volt, baby ko base pasand he
 
 
 Like the songs are still going on
 dance kaa scope hone ke chalate ye gane parties main bhi khub chale
 The final film to be screened in this theater will be 'dangal', while 'dangal' will have harmful Bapu, Dhakad, Theme Song Dangal
 
 
 ke liye preetam ne acchhee compojishans banaai hai
 The rest of the songs have not been promoted and are not as powerful
 to mujeec ke akhaade main 'sultan' behatar maani ja sakati he

 samachar agency ‘aaraaie novosti’ ke anusaar pracheen olympic khelon kaa aayojan 1200 saal purv yoddha-khilaadiyon ke bich hua tha
 Although the first official event of the Olympics was held in 776 BC, the last was held in 394 AD
 iske baad rome ke samraat theodosis ne ise murtipuja vaala utsav qaraar dekar is par pratibandh laga diya gaya
 After this, these games were forgotten for about one hundred and fifty years

 But they could not get the status of sports event
 kul milakar rome or greece jaisi prabhutvaadi sabhyataaon ke abhaav main is kaal main logon ke paas khelon ke liye samay nahin tha
 In the 19th century, this tradition of the ancient period was revived with the development of a common civilization in Europe
 iskaa shrey france ke abhijaat purush bairon piyare di kuvarten ko jaataa he
 Kuvarthen set two goals, one is to make the Games popular in his country and second, to mobilize all the countries for a peaceful competition
 kuvarten maanate the ki khel yudhon ko taalane ke sabase achche madhyam ho sakate hai
 Based on this hypothesis of Kuvarthen, for the first time in 1896, the modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, the capital of Greece
 shuruaati dashak main olympic andolan apane astitv ko bachaane ke liye sangharsh karata rahaa kyonki kuvarten kii is pariklpana ko kisi bhi badi shakti kaa saath nahin mil sakaa tha
 The two editions of the Olympics held in Paris and St
 Louis in the years 1900 and 1904 could not be popular as there was a shortage of grand events during this time

 saamaajik or rajnatik str par jari pratispardhaa ke kaaran naajiyon ne ise apni shreshthata sabit karne kaa madhyam bana diya
 The fame of the Olympics peaked as the soviet-america competition entered the sporting arena in the 1950s
 iske baad to khel kabhi bhi raajnneeti se alag nahin hua
 Sports are not just a matter of politics
 ye raajnneeti kaa ahm hissaa ban gaye
 Because the superpowers like the Soviet Union and America never openly fought each other on the battlefield
 lihaaja unhone olympic ko apni shreshthata sabit karne kaa madhyam bana liya
 Former US President John F
 kennedy ne ek baar kaha tha ki antariksh yaan or olympic swarna padak hi kisi desh kii pratishtha kaa pratik hote hai
 Spacecraft and gold medals emerged as the biggest objectives of the superpowers during the Cold War era

 The Soviet Union repaid the defeat at the hands of the United States in the Mexico Olympics of 1968 at the 1972 Munich Olympics
 soviet sangh kii 50veen varshganth par vahaan ke log kisi bhi keemat par america se haarana nahin chaahate the
 As a result, Soviet athletes won a total of 99 medals with 50 gold medals
 yah sankhya america dwaara jite gaye padakon se ek tihaai zyada thi
 In 1980, the US and its allies in the West refused to participate in the 1980 Moscow Olympics
 iske baad hisaab chukaane ke liye soviet sangh ne 1984 ke los anjalis olympic kaa bahishkaar kar diya
 The Soviet Union once again proved its superiority at the 1988 Seoul Olympics
 usne 132 padak jite
 It had 55 golds
 america ko 34 swarna sahit 94 padak mili the
 The US finished third after East Germany
 varsh 1992 ke barsilona olympic main bhi soviet sangh ne apana varchasv kaayam rakhaa
 However, the Soviet Union had disintegrated by that time

 The Chief Minister formed the Inspection of Education in March this year reviving the British system for inspection of educational institutions and improving education
 isse rajya ke sabhi skulon main kaksha ek se ganit, hindi or angreji kii padhai sunishchit kii jaaegi
 Apart from this, in the budget, the Chief Minister announced a scheme under which excellent infrastructure and teaching facilities will be provided in two higher secondary schools of each assembly constituency
 jaraa sochie ek aisi party ke bare main jahaan jaakar aap na photo clic kar sakate hai, na selfi le sakate hai, na hi fasebuk par koi post apadet kar sakate hai
 Can there be such a party? Yes, a similar party is happening nowadays in New York and surrounding cities
 jisamen aapke smartphone ko party ke dauraan aapse dur rakhaa jaataa he
 You can also call it Smartphone Free Zone
 aakhirkaar, Facebook par aa saktaa he 'dislike' batan!reports ke anusaar is party kaa naam 'you had tu bi der' rakhaa gaya he
 Actually, as soon as you enter the party, the security staff takes your phone from you and puts it in a pouch named Yondr and gives it back to you
 yahirondr paauch hi he jo smartfonko aapse dur rakhata he
 But just think why you can't take out your phone from it even though the pouch is in your hand
 darasal Yondr nioprin se bana ek aisa paauch he jise banane vaali company party orgenisers or baaki event mekars ko rent par detii he
 As soon as you go to a party and the security staff takes your phone and imprisons it, then due to its special locking system, you cannot open it even with scissors
 or yadi aap apana phone kisi apatkaaleen samay main upyog karnaa chaahate hai to iske liye aapako party se baahar janaa hoga
 You will be able to open this pouch easily as you go out
 mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye sarkaar launch karegi anti-trolling ap'you had tu bi der' ke nirmaataa ab is party ko aasapaas ke shaharon main teji se failaa rahe hai
 And Yondr is also becoming quite popular due to the special technology to keep humans away from smartphones
 yahaan tak ki reports bataate hai ki new yark ke skulon main is paauch kaa upyog rojaanaa ho rahaa he
 So that children can stay away from smartphones
 ye paauch ab bade-bade party kaa bhi hissaa banane ja rahaa he
 Because this small device has connected the whole world to each other and away from each other

 Answering this question, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige told Screen Rant in an interview with, "I think the one thing that is most interesting about the timeline of the film in our case is that these characters have a great past
 Is, and there is a possibility of future stories about it
 " to iskaa sidhaa sa matlab ye he ki maarval kii agali film ek prikval film ho sakati he

 Comedian Bharti Singh (bharti Singh) is a big influence on TV as well as social media
 unke kai video aise hote hai, jo kaaphi mjedaar hote hai
 But recently, such a video of Bharti Singh is going viral, which everyone is surprised to see
 is video main bharti singh apane pati harsh limbacha (harsh Limbachiya) ke bal khinchate or unka bura haal karti dikhaai de rahi hai
 In fact, Bharti Singh's husband Harsh Limbachya was flirting with actress Priya Banerjee, which the comedian was quite enraged by seeing
 bharti singh ke is video ne logon kaa khub dhyaan khinchaa he, saath hi unke phens isapar apana riection bhi de rahe hai
 This is a Ticketcock video of Bharti Singh and Harsh Limbachya, which is going on a rampage

 But then Bharti Singh comes from behind and pulls her hair and asks what is this all about

 Pakistan's former military chief and former President Pervez Musharraf said that he was contemplating the use of nuclear weapons against India at the time of the tension created after the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in 2001, but thinking of retaliation He abandoned his idea

 There has been controversy and controversy over the 4-year degree course in DU
 diu ke soshal science ke baad ab science department ne bhi naye silebus par muhar laga di, to vahiin chaatro or teachers ne iske virodh main pradarshan kiya
 Outside the DU Arts faculty, these people were protesting against a 4-year degree course, while a new syllabus was being stamped in the Science Department within a short distance
 naye satr main admician ke liye mahaj 2 maheene kaa samay bachaa he or abhi tak silebus puri tarah se taiyaar nahin ho paae hai
 Despite this, DU VC is intent on implementing a 4-year degree program from this session
 diu prashasan kaa yahi rukh teachers ke virodh kii mukhya vajah he
 On Saturday, the Social Science Department announced a new syllabus
 isi hafte naye degree program ke liye baaki department bhi apana silebus final kar sakate hai
 After the implementation of the new course, syllabus of all subjects will be changed, according to which all students will be required to read 11 foundation courses

 This course is being implemented in a hurry
 mangalvaar se diu teachers ne acadmic badlaavon kaa virodh or tej karne kaa faisla kiya he
 India's new mantra is "make in India", not love and peace
 vaise bhi vah prem koi prem nahin, jisamen premi musalmaan or premika hindu ho, tab vah jehad kahalaane lagata he
 Many Hindus harbor hatred for India's Muslim heritage, but are unable to express it openly, they pour it out towards Pakistan
 pakistan is nafrat ke jehar ke liye nilkanth ban jaataa he
 It seems that peace cannot be maintained until there is truly peace
 agar hamaara rashtriya mishan pehle bharat ko viksit karnaa he, to pakistan koi myne nahin rakhata
 It is neither a market nor a competitor, nor a destination for investment or technology
 ham itani teji se aage bade ja rahe hai ki pakistan hamaari najar ke daayre main nahin he
 We have such a strategic force because of the vast geographical area that the Pakistan Army is looking forward to
 hamaari aabaadi usase chah guna zyada he or hamaari arthvyavastha usase aath guna badi he
 Pakistan's economy has been in recession for almost two decades, but after five years of sluggishness, India's economy has regained momentum, so the difference between the two is also increasing
 jin logon ne sheet yuddh ke daur main pakistan ko bharat ke bainks khadaa karne kii koshish kii thi, unhen bhi iskaa ehsaas ho gaya tha ki yah mumkin nahin
 In such a situation, we often ask, why do Pakistanis not see this, why do they not realize even after rubbing their nose? Actually, they realize it
 hamaari chook to yah he ki ham bees karod kii aabaadi vaale desh ko hi buraai kaa pratik maan lete hai jabaki unamem se zyaadaatar ko apni jindagi kii phikr he
 They may fear India but most people know how far behind Pakistan is
 ve is hakeekat se bhi waakif hai ki unki pareshaaniyaan unki apni hai, hamaari kisi sajeesh kaa nateeja nahin hai
 At present, anti-india in Pakistan is no longer as widespread as it is with Pakistan
 vahaan kaa shikshit va vyavsaayik tabaka majboot hote bharat ke saath talmail kaa icchhuk he
 The Indians who say this wrong, did not consider the last two elections there
 us dauraan vahaan na to videshi haath or na hi kattar rashtrawaad kaa hauva tha
 Both the major parties mentioned India only in the context that they would try their best to maintain peace with it
 pakistan ke siyaasi netaaon ne apane kahe par amal bhi kiya
 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif came to swear in the Indian Prime Minister despite opposition from the army
 yah isaki misaal he ki ki fouj or rajnatik netaaon ke nazariye main kitna fark aa gaya he
 Earlier in 2008, Pakistani President Asif Zardari created a sensation in the Indian media by saying that he "dreamed of the day when Pakistan would become a country of qualitative increase in India's strength"
 ’’yah kehane kii himmat koi bhartiya netaa pakistan ke bare main yaa kisi bhi anya desh ke bare main shaayad hi juta paaegaa
 However, there was a voice in Pakistan against this
 pakistani fouj to itani baukhala gai ki usne apane agenton se kabul main hamaare duutavas or phir mumbai main hamale karwaae
 We hardly notice this contradiction between the Pakistani army and the common people
 hamen pakistani fouj ke is daawey ko khaarij karne kii har mumkin koshish kerani chahie ki bharat unke desh ke liye khatra he
 In response to the firing on the Line of Control, opening our mouths of our machine guns and mortars and killing common people across the border is exactly what their army wants us to do
 isse pakistani general na to rukate hai, na kamjor hote hai, ulate unhen takat milti he
 Like contradictory figures, our policy of "aggressive protection" is unreasonable
 to kya dilli ke hamaare hukmaranon kii samaj is baat par ban padi he ki pakistan se paidaa hone vaala aatankwaad hi hamaari suraksha ke liye sabase bada khatra he or uske rukne tak uske saath saamaanya rishte kii sambhaavna kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 It is a matter of regret that in the case of Pakistan, irrespective of the government in Delhi, they are unanimous
 ham khud ko pakistan se alag-thalag nahin rakh sakate
 Efficient intelligence will stop attacks from across the border, as happened after the Mumbai attack
 lekin jab tak uski fouj ziddee bani hui he, hamale puri tarah nahin rukenge
 In such a situation, what are the options before us? After the Mumbai attack, FICCI had asked a panel of experts to study the threats posed by terrorism to India
 un visheshgyon main se kuch maujuuda sarkaar ke salaahkaar bhi hai
 Among them were three retired police officers, who are said to be heavily knowledgeable
 unki siforeeshon main gupt karrwai se lekar aarthik paabandiyon or lakshith seemaa-paar hamalon tak sabhi tarah ke upaay shaamil the
 Today all these measures are being discussed again in the new government
 lekin inamen koi bhi kargar upaay katai nahin he
 This covert action means doing to Pakistan what its terrorists do to us
 yah badi galati hogi
 In this way, we will fight with the Pakistani army on its terms, kill innocent Pakistanis and destroy the democratic government
 is tarah ham aman chaahane waalon ko alag-thalag kar denge
 Economic sanctions have no meaning because there is no trade with Pakistan nor do we have any investment there
 kisi parmaanu hathiyaar sampann desh kii seemaa main ghuskar hamale itane jokhim bhare hai ki america ne afghanistan sthit apni sena par hamalon ke baavjood pakistan main kabhi morcha kholane kii koshish nahin kii
 Operation Parakram in 2002 has proved that any international crisis causes us many times more damage than Pakistan
 yani ye nitiyaan nahin, kora gapp hai
 Then, looking at the relationship with Pakistan with just one issue is also a stubborn attitude, as Pakistan has been maintaining the Kashmir issue for decades
 kai log yah daleel dete rahe hai ki sajhi samasyaon va hiton vaale do padosiyon ke bich kuchhek muddon par ada rahanaa sahi nahin he
 Most of the Pakistanis have accepted this argument whereas on the contrary we have adopted the argument of their army
 bharat main logon ke saamne maujuud khataron ke paimaane par aatankwaad kahaan thahartaa he? south asia terarysm portal ke ekatra kiye gaye aankade bataate hai ki 2009 main 721 bhartiya aatankwaadiyon ke haathon maare gaye
 The figure for the next four years was 759, 429, 252 and 304
 inamen se bahut kam mauton ke liye hi pakistan ko jimmedaar tehraaya ja saktaa he
 In 2013, 159 out of 304 people were killed by left-wing extremists, 95 were killed in Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya and Nagaland and 30 in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal
 jammu-kashmir main, jahaan pakistani aatankwaadi zyaadaatar sakriy hai, yah sankhya keval 20 thi
 The same year, Pakistani terrorists killed 3,001 innocent Pakistanis
 yakeenan pakistan aatankwaad kaa centre he lekin vahiin sabase zyada tabaahi bhi machati he
 This catastrophe that is happening almost daily in Pakistan does not find a place in the Indian media
 lekin wagha seemaa ke paar fidaayin hamalaa shaayad hamen yah ehsaas kara rahaa he ki vahaan aam log or sarkaar kisase rou-ba-rou hai
 Of course, terrorism has a political effect that is not against ordinary crimes, but it is also true that only peace can prevent terrorism from Pakistan completely
 aisa tab mumkin hoga jab vahaan kii fouj saath de
 The army will give support only when either the general is in power or the democratic government will be strong enough to keep the army under control or the army feels that only peace will serve its interests
 ab jabaki pakistan main sainya takhtapalat kii ashanka kam he kyonki fouj is khastahali main desh ke shashan kaa bojh mol nahin lenaa chaahati, to yah hamaare hit main he ki generalon ke bainks vahaan ke loktantric netritv ko majboot karne ke liye ham har mumkin madad karen
 This will require constant communication with him
 iske saath hi ham pakistani fouj main bhi mithaas bharne ke tareeke khoj sakate hai
 When General Pervez Musharraf pressured the army that peace was inevitable, the Pakistanis said that its evidence lies in the fact that its officers had bought a lot of land on both sides of the road leading to Wagah
 pakistani fouj ke bade vanijyik or audyogic hit hai
 His officers who are heavily funded, cultivate profits
 masalan, ham uske do vanijyik thikaanon se cement kharid sakate hai; apana bhandar bharne ke liye gehun kharid sakate hai; unke saath milakar sindh main plant laga sakate hai taaki pakistan ke vishaal lignite bhandar kaa istemaal karke bijli banaaen or apana carbon footprint badaye bina bijli aayaat kar len
 Hardline elements may not be bought, but we can assure the rest of the Pakistani military that peace with India is beneficial for them
 pichley dashak ke madhya main hamane isaki shuruyaat bhi kii thi
 But our current policy of silence and violence is a form of masculine masculinity that merely reduces the flag bearers of peace across the border and makes the warriors happy
 yakeenan, ham pakistani fouj main unmaadiyon ko darkinar nahin kar sakate parabakiyon ke saath samvaad bananaa hoga
 It will be difficult, but then diplomacy is not to teach a lesson to the educated
 (satyabrat paal 2006 se 2009 tak pakistan main bharat ke ucchayukta the) The Congress on Wednesday overruled the issue of amnesty of Afzal Guru, accused of attacking Parliament, saying that the matter has to be decided by the President, Central Government and Delhi Government, who have all the facts
 congress pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet karte hue kaha, ‘is par koi tippanee karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he’

 The Delhi government on Tuesday sent the file of Afzal to the Lieutenant Governor with the remark that he had no objection to the execution of the hanging but the aspect of the effects on law and order should also be taken into consideration
 uparajyapal tejindar khanna ne dilli sarkaar kii tippanee par atirikt spashtikaran ke liye yah file lautaa di thi
 Including some 'petty explanations', the Delhi government has again sent the file of apology petition of Afzal Guru, convicted for terrorist attack on Parliament, to the Lieutenant Governor

 The Delhi government has exempted women from this trial started for 15 days and has not implemented it on two-wheelers
 sarkaar ne vakeelon ko is niyam se baahar rakhane se inkaar kar diya he
 Filing a petition in the Delhi High Court, the question has been raised as to why women and two-wheelers have been kept out of this? is

 There are 7 lakh two-wheelers, which is a major reason for increasing pollution in Delhi (32 per cent)
 yani jin gadiyon par ye niyam lagu hota he, unke mukaable chhot vaali gadiyon kii sankhya kai guna zyada he
 Experts say that the purpose of the aud-even formula will be nullified by the exemptions of such a large number of trains
 in gadiyon par niyam lagu nahintangh vaahanon par niyam lagu nahin hoga

 jeeyo news ke mutabik, jab donon deshon ne sambandhit duutavaason main kaam kar rahe ek-duusare ke rajanyikon par yatra pratibandh lagaae the, to may ke baad se yah pehali baar he ki america or pakistani adhikariyon ko bich ucch stareey vaarta hui he
 The relationship between the two countries has been tense for some time

 The US also demanded Pakistan to take action against the Haqqani network and the terrorist organization Taliban
 haalanki, pakistan ne in sabhi aaropon ko nakaar diya tha or kaha ki vah aatankwaad ke khilaaf yuddh jari rakhega
 Significantly, Pakistan continuously promises to take action against terrorism and cries before the world that it is suffering from terrorism itself
 lekin pakistan khud hi apni jameen par aatankwaadiyon kaa saath detaa he
 GST will be launched at midnight tonight
 iske liye sansad bhawan main vyapak taiyaariyaan kii gai hai
 In the midst of all this, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said that there is a lot of potential in GST but it is being implemented in a hurry in half-complete format to promote itself
 notebandi kii tarah hi jiesti ko ek aksham or asamvedansheel sarkaar dwaara sansthagat taiyaari ke bagaiyr lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 There is a need to introduce such GST in India which does not put crores of citizens, small businessmen and businessmen in such a concern
 isse purv kendriya mantri em venkaiya naidu ne mukhya vipakshi dal congress se aitihaasik maal evam seva kar (jiesti) se jude kaarykram main shaamil hone kii apil kii he
 He said that the aura of this dignified program should not be spoiled for 'good reasons'
 soochna prasaaran, shahari vikaas or awaas tathaa shahari garibi unmoolan mantri naidu ne daawa kiya ki congress is baat ko sweekaar nahin kar paa rahi he ki narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri ban gaye hai or isiilie vah sansad ke kendriya kaksh main yojit kaarykram kaa virodh kar rahi he
 He however requested the Congress to reconsider the decision to boycott the ceremony
 tippaniyan Naidu told a channel, Congress is opposing it simply because it does not want to see Prime Minister Narendra Modi's three mantras Reform, Performance and Transform succeed because it is his political
 naidu ke mutabik jab vipaksh samet desh ke sabhi raajnneetik dal jiesti masaude par ekamat he, aise main unka virodho sirf yah dikhaata he ki vah pradhanmantri ke saath khadey hone main hichak rahe hai
 It is noteworthy that the country's biggest tax reform, Goods and Services Tax, ie GST or Goods and Services Tax, will be held in the historic Central Hall of Parliament on Friday midnight (ie Saturday, July 1, 2017) in the presence of President Dr
 Pranab Mukherjee
 Will be launched by Narendra Modi
 azaadi ke baad se yah chauthaa mauka hoga, jab central haul main aadhi raat ko koi samaaroh yojit hoga
 The last three programs are related to the independence of the country, and this is one reason why the Congress has announced the boycott of the Friday night program
 kai anya vipakshi dal bhi kaarykram se dur rahane vaale hai
 It is believed that the GST that is going to replace many indirect taxes will completely change our economy of US $ 20 trillion
 (inputs bhashaa se bhi) Earlier, Union Minister m Venkaiah Naidu appealed to the main opposition party Congress to join the historic Goods and Services Tax (GST) program
 unhone kaha ki is garimamay kaarykram kii abha ko 'aache kaarnon' se nahin bigaada janaa chahie
 Information broadcasting, Urban Development and Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation Minister Naidu claimed that the Congress was unable to accept that Narendra Modi had become the Prime Minister of the country and that is why she was opposing the program held in the Central Hall of Parliament is
 haalanki unhone congress se samaaroh ke samaaroh ke bahishkaar ke nirnay par punavarchir kaa anurodh kiya
 The comments ek channel se naidu ne kaha, congress iskaa virodh mahaj isliye kar rahi he, kyonki vah pradhanmantri narendra modi ke teen mantra riform, parform or transform ko safal hota nahin dekhnaa chaahate kyonki yah unki raajnneetik he
 According to Naidu, when all political parties in the country including the opposition are unanimous on the GST draft, their opposition only shows that he is hesitant to stand with the Prime Minister

 2003 kaa saal tha
 In Raipur, a paan was asking who would form the government
 wo chup rah gaya
 When the people left, the paan said that we will not say anything
 pataa nahin koun sarkaar kaa aadmi yahaan khadaa ho or baad main mujhe pareshaani ho jaae
 At the same time a senior officer came to see me
 hotel ke kamare main aane par bataaya ki wo saamne se nahin balki hotel ke peeche se aae hai
 i was very surprised
 kaha ki pataa nahin kab sarkaar ko pataa chal jaae
 Many such stories were heard
 zaruri nahin ki sach hi hon magar logon main yah baith gai thi ki sarkaar saaye kii tarah unka peechha kar rahi he
 It was the first time i had the opportunity to cover elections
 chhattisgarh ghoomane kaa junun bhi savaar ho gaya
 The work of Ajit Jogi's government was seen on the roads it built
 tab chhattisgarh main hamaare rajya bihar kii tulana main kai guna behatar sadaken thim
 Seeing those streets, it seemed that Jogi would not give up, but when people kept quiet while talking, it was believed that Jogi would lose
 aam logon main bhi yah chhavi ban gai thi ki chhattisgarh kii media main jogi ke kilaaf kuch bhi nahin chhapata he
 He had also opened a TV channel, which disappeared after he lost his election
 aksar kai log media or soshal media se khilne ke maamle main pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa naam lete hai lekin yah sab congress samskruti kaa hi hissaa rahaa he
 People knew that only the praise of the government was published in the newspaper
 jogi ne kuch channelon ko band bhi kara diya tha
 All the surveys were showing the leadership of the Jogi government
 main sirf isi aadhaar par kah rahaa tha ki jogi haar jaaenge
 i remember then my editor said how you say you will lose
 survey to jogi ko jeeta rahe hai
 i used to say that if the perception of a government becomes that it is listening, chasing like a shadow and no one can condemn it openly, people beat it
 tab bijepi ke kai bade netaa bhi mujhase yah poocha karte the ki vaaki ham jeet rahe hai
 i have seen the same happening during the Chautala government in Haryana
 vahaan kii media chautaala may ho gai thi
 People were afraid to speak openly that the people of Chautala would listen
 ab dar kaayam karne main sarkaar kii sidhe bhoomika thi yaa nahin, is par vivaad ho saktaa he magar kai baar samaaj ke ek varg main aisi dharna ban jaati he ki media azaad nahin he
 No one is saying anything koi unka peechha kar rahaa he
 Someone is listening to the phone
 koi tex kii filein palat rahaa he to log us sarkaar se darane lagate hai
 When men start to fear the government, then there is nothing left with that government
 satta ke mad main netaa aksar is baat kaa lutf uthaane lagate hai ki meraa jalawaa kaayam he
 At that time, a close supporter of the Chautala government in Haryana had also asked what it looked like
 maine isi aadhaar par kah diya tha ki chautaala haar jaaenge
 Jokingly said that you made a mistake
 akhabaaron main apane kilaaf khabaren bhi chhapane dete
 Obviously it was late
 main samajhataa hum ki kisi kii haar or jeet ke ek kaaran nahin hote hai
 There are many reasons and many types of situations are created
 lekin un tamaam kaarnon main ek kaaran yah bhi he ki sarkaar ke bare main dharna kisi he
 This time, a section in Delhi heard a lot about this fear
 khaskar kiran bedi ke intervyuu ke baad
 Many people started calling me many times
 inamen se kuch sarkaar samarthak log bhi the
 Everyone started advising that you should be careful
 ek dukandaar ne kaha ki aapako dar nahin lagata
 This government can do anything
 mujhe bahut hairaani hoti thi
 i used to keep saying that there is nothing like this
 sarkaar kii aalochana to hote hi rahati he
 Also occurs in media
 magar log maanane ko taiyaar nahin the
 He said that see only the government is praised in the media
 akhabaaron main duusari baton kaa koi zikr hi nahin he
 i cannot forget the point of an ordinary woman, why should we listen to the same thing
 kaise pataa ki wo thik he
 If you listen to others, then you will see who is fine
 main kai netaaon se baat karata hum to achaanak unke swar badal jate hai
 As soon as they notice that someone will listen, they start looking around
 patrakaron se baat karata hum to yah baat zyada sunai detii he ki phone par nahin
 Will talk together
 ek sajjan mujhase milane aae the
 i was surprised that he could not say this on the phone so came to meet him
 yah sab kisi sarkaar ke liye achche sanket nahin hote hai
 Gradually, all these things start to become public at different levels
 sarkaar kaa iqbaal hona chahie
 The government's fear should not be sustained
 main sankhya to nahin bataa saktaa magar yah sankhya itani to thi hi ki kisi bhi sarkaar ko chintaa kerani chahie
 Such a belief was formed
 tivi par ghanto kawarej ne logon ke man main shankaa paidaa kar di thi ki aakhir kya baat he ki sirf tarif ho rahi he
 He was also looking at the conditions around him, in which there was no change in the level to which the level was being praised
 dilli tivi or akhbaar se las shahar he
 Newspapers are carefully read here
 kai log kehete hai ki janata adheer ho gai
 It's not like this
 jis anupaat main media sarkaar kii tarif kar rahaa tha, us anupaat main badlaav nazar nahin aa rahaa tha
 It happened that without doing anything itself, a kind of mistrust became
 log majboot netritv chaahate hai isliye ki wo kade faisle len or sabko saath lekar chalem
 But there was a message from somewhere that people are also being intimidated in the name of strong leadership
 isamen yogadan diya un logon kii aakraamakata ne jo din bhar pradhanmantri kaa naam lekar virdohi swar ko dhamkaane lage the
 The Prime Minister was communicating on one side, but on the other side, those who spoke in his name were giving different messages
 isi ke saath hi jod-tod se judi khabaron ne bhi in ashankaon ko bal diya ki sarkaar ke khilaaf bolnaa mushkil he
 In democracy, the public does not always take to speak against the government as an enemy
 wo is bolne se raahat mahasoos karti he
 He feels that someone is keeping the government on a straight path
 aisa isliye chaahati he ki wo us sarkaar se pyaar karti he
 When the public is going to choose that government, it wants someone to keep an eye on it
 koi uski aalochana kare or sarkaar bhi saamne aakar jawaab de
 Until this two-way dialogue is held, people's trust in the government becomes weak
 aajkal tamaam sarkarein ekatarfa samvaad kaa tarika apnaane lagi hai
 This poses the risk of information being unreliable
 soshal media aalochana ke swar ko dabaane kaa hathiyaar ban gaya he
 Many ways to silence it have been built here
 aap ek sawaal karenge to udhar se kai log puuchhenge ki aapane unke bare main sawaal kiya
 It is not balance and comparison but bullying rather than answering how the question is asked
 aam logon ko isse bharosa nahin miltaa he
 There are still common people who vote for everyone, but keep an eye on keeping distance from them
 is nai raajnneetik samskruti main ab ek party hi shaamil nahin he
 Most parties have started doing so
 samarthakon kii aisi fouj he ki ek sawaal kiya nahin ki dhunaai chaalu ho jaati he
 Abuses are given to journalists or people who question
 loktantr main aasthaa rakhane waalon ko in baton par gaharaai se sochna hoga
 It is the responsibility of the government to provide space for criticism and even unilateral criticism
 ek sarkaar ke bare main jitna khulaa moolyankan hota he utana hi acha hota he
 The government has a chance to communicate and resolve
 dilli ke janadesh ko tarah-tarah se padhaa jayega or padhaa janaa chahie
 As of now, the victory of Narendra Modi has yet to be properly analyzed, the chapter on the charisma of Arvind Kejriwal has also been added
 par jo bhi vishleshan karen, ek chapter is par bhi rakhen ki haarate or jitate vakt janata main sarkaar ke bare main kya dharna thi
 After all, why were people saying that there should be someone to raise the voice
 kya log sarkaar se darane lage the
 Increasing the pressure on the UPA government at the Center, the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly has demanded that India submit a proposal to the UN Security Council on a separate Tamil Eelam and stop calling Sri Lanka the Allies
 vidhansabha ne buudhvaar ko sarvasammati se is sambandh main prastaav paarit kiya

 mahilaon ke bag main mechap kit ho yaa na ho, lekin ek lipstick to jarur rahati he
 a lipstick works to add beauty to the beauty of women
 yadi ise thik tarah se hothon par na lagaaya jaae to yah aapaki khubsuurati par grahan bhi laga sakati he
 Let us know what is the right way to apply lipstick
 1
 Before applying lipstick, check that your lips are not dry or chapped or else the skin color between the cracks will spoil your beauty
 aise main ruukhe honton par pehle lip balm yaa glisreen jarur lagaaein, uske baad hi lipstick istemaal karen
 2
 lipstick lagane se pehle lip pencil se gahare rang kaa outline yaa shed bana len
 This will bring the shape of lips and then your lipstick will look more attractive
 lipstick kaa keval ek hi kot lagaayenge to vah jaldi halki pad jaaegi
 Apply at least two-three coats of lipstick
 doosraa, lipstick kaa istemaal apni skill ke color ko dhyaan main rakhkar karnaa bhi jaruri he
 4
 lipstick kaa ek kot lagane ke baad honton par ungaliyon se halkaa sa powder lagaaein, aisa karne se lipstick puri tarah set ho jaaegi
 After this, if you feel that the lipstick has become lighter, then you can apply another coat
 desh ke bainkon kaa hajaaron karod rupee kaa lone lekar faraar sharaab kaarobaari vijay maalya ne guuruuvaar ko lagaataar kai twit kar piem modi ko hi gherne kii koshish kii
 In his last speech in the 16th Lok Sabha on Wednesday, PM Modi had talked about a man who 'ran away' without taking Mallya's name for Rs 9000 crore
 iske jawaab main maalya ne kaha ki vah to paisa lautaane ko taiyaar hai, lekin piem modi aakhir bainkon se ise lene ko kehete kyon nahin
 In a tweet, the fugitive businessman Mallya said, 'I want to ask with respect why the Prime Minister does not instruct his banks that i am willing to pay the money i owe to Kingfisher to pay the public funds
 Take it 'following on from my earlier tweet, i respectfully ask why the Prime Minister is not instructing his Banks to take the money i have put on the table so he can at least claim credit for full recovery of public funds lent to Kingfisher
 - Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya) February 14, 2019 Vijay Mallya said in another tweet that PM Modi is a good orator and the kind of stories the media has created, i assume that he was talking about me only 
 maalya ne kaha, 'sansad main pradhanmantri kaa antim bhaashan par meraa dhyaan gaya he
 He is definitely a good speaker
 maine yah gaur kiya ki vah bina naam liye ek vyakti kii baat kar rahe the jo 9000 karod rupee lekar 'faraar' ho gaya he
 Looking at the media stories, i can assume that he was talking about me only
 'the Prime Ministers last speech in Parliament was brought to my attention
 He is certainly a very eloquent speaker
 i noticed that he referred to an unnamed person who “ran away” with 9000 crores
 Given the media narrative i can only infer that reference is to me
 — Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya)february 14, 2019maalya ne kaha ki unhone karnataka hoicourt main is masale ko nipataane kii peshkash bhi kii thi
 Mallya said, 'it cannot be dismissed as a trivial proposal
 yah puri tarah se vaastavik, gambhir, eemaandaar or puraa ho sakane vaali peshkash he
 Now the ball is in the second court
 bank kingfisher airlines ko diya gaya karj waapas kyon nahin lete
 'I have made the offer to settle before the hon'ble High Court Court of Karnataka
 This cannot be dismissed as frivolous
 It is a perfectly tangible, sincere, honest and readily achievable offer
 The shoe is on the other foot now
 Why don't the banks take the money lent to KFA? - Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya) February 14, 2019 Mallya once again defended himself saying that he had already put his assets of about Rs 14,000 crore before the court
 ek or twit main maalya ne kaha, 'main pravartan nideshaalay ke daavon ke bare main media main ai in khabaron par chakit hum ki maine apni sampatti chhupaai he
 This is a shameful incident of misleading the public, though it is not surprising
 yadi koi chuphi sampatti hoti to main court ke saamne kareeb 14,000 karod rupee kii sampatti kaise khule aam pesh kar paata?am appalled to say the least at the media reports on the Enforcement Directorate claims that i hid my wealth ! If there was hidden wealth how could i put approximately 14,000 crores worth of assets openly in front of Court ? Shameful misleading of public opinion but unsurprising
 - Vijay Mallya (@thevijaymallya) February 14, 2019 Significantly, in November 2016, a special PMLA court in Mumbai declared liquor businessman Vijay Mallya as a 'fugitive'
 iske saath hi court ne maalya kii sabhi gharelu sampatti, share or dibenture ko jabt karne kaa aadesh diya
 He is absconding to a consortium of banks carrying around Rs 9,000 crore
 uske upar tex chori or mani londring ke maamle alag se chal rahe hai
 On the remarks made by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in an interview given to NDTV, Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung has said that the Chief Minister should be forgiven as he does not know what he says
 jang ne kaha, ishwar unhen maaf karen, vah nahin jaanate ki kya bolte hai
 In his first interview after becoming the Chief Minister of Delhi, Kejriwal attacked Lt Governor Najeeb Jung and called him a 'polling agent' of the BJP and alleged that the Lt Governor had changed his government house to 'BJP headquarters' 
 tippaniyan Criticizing Najib Jung, Kejriwal said that he does not give an appointment or even pick up his phone to Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia or other ministers of Delhi
 lekin yadi amit shah (bijepi adhyaksh) ke chaukeedaar unhen (up rajyapal ko) phone karte hai to ve rengte hue jaaenge
 Targeting PM Modi, Kejriwal said, "the people of Delhi voted for us and the rest of the country supported Modi
" isliye meharbaani kar hamen dilli ko chalaane den or aap (modi) desh ko chalaaen
 Do not create problems for us through LG day
 ek achche pradhanmantri ko yah sab shobhaa nahin detaa
 It is not right to take revenge of Delhi's defeat with the public and AAP
 dilli kaa mukhyamantri banane ke baad apane pehle intervyuu main kejariwal ne up rajyapal najeeb jang par or tikhaa hamalaa karte hue unhen bijepi kaa 'poling agent' qaraar diya or aarope lagaaya ki up rajyapal ne apane sarkari awaas ko 'bijepi mukhyalay' main badal diya he
 The comments najeeb jang kii aalochana karte hue kejariwal ne kaha ki vah up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya yaa dilli ke anya mantriyon tak ko milane kaa samay nahin dete yaa unke phone nahin uthaate
 But if the watchman of Amit Shah (BJP president) calls him (to the Lieutenant Governor) then he will go crawling
 piem modi ko nishane par lete hue kejariwal ne kaha, dilli kii janata ne hamaare liye vot diya or baaki desh ne modi kaa samarthan kiya
 So please let us run Delhi and you (modi) run the country
 alji ke jariye aae din hamaare liye samasyaayein paidaa nahin karen
 All this does not suit a good Prime Minister
 dilli kii haar kaa badla janata or 'aap' se lenaa sahi nahin he

 In a meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Committee on Monday, it was decided that Bihar Governor Ramnath Kovind will be the NDA candidate for the post of President
 ramnath kovind kaa janm 1 oktober 1945 ko kanpur ke ek gaanv paronkh main hua
 He studied Commerce and LLB from Kanpur University

 bharat kii raajnneeti main do chaar hi bade master stroke hai
 Women, Muslims, Dalits and Backward
 anusuchit janajati kaa card kam hi chalata he
 May have been retained for the post of Vice President
 2017 kii tarah 1997 main ek aisa hi master stroke congress ne chalaa tha jab ke aar narayanan kaa naam raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par ghoshit hua tha
 His candidature was supported by the BJP to the United Front
 kya congress ab bijepi ko ritern gift degi
 It was a historic watch, for the first time a Dalit was going to sit on the peak of the Republic of India
 narayanan ke khilaaf kisi bhi bade dal ne campan nahin kiya, shivasena ko chhod kar jisane tii en sheshan ko apana ummidavaar banaaya tha
 r Narayanan of that time received 9,56,290 votes out of a total of 11,04,546 votes for the President
 ye tabaka record tha
 KR Narayanan raised such questions in front of the judiciary about which there was still silence and clashed with the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the recommendations of President's rule
 25 july 1999 ke india today main prabhu chawla kii ek report aap internet par pard sakate hai
 In November 1998, President Narayanan commented on record on the file of the appointment of judges, why he is not represented in the judiciary despite being a qualified candidate of scheduled castes and tribes
 tab khub bahes hui thi
 Eight years later, in 2006, KG Balakrishnan became the first Dalit Chief Justice of India
 gopal gandhi jinaki ummidavaari kii baat thodi der ke liye is saal chali thi, ve raashtrapati ke aar narayanan ke sachiv the
 He wrote on behalf of the President on the collegium file that the judge should file an objection or consent in writing about all the decisions from the transfer
 oktober 1998 main atal bihari vaajapeyi cabinet ne bihar main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii sifarish kar di, narayanan ne 80 ghante tak vichaar karne ke baad yah kahkar lautaa diya ki sarkaar dobaaraa vichaar kare kyonki unhen nahin lagata ki bihar main koi sanvaidhanik sankat he
 Now compare this step with the signature of the current President Pranab Mukherjee on the recommendation of President's rule in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh
 donon hi faisle adaalaton se khaarij ho gayi balki uttarakhand kii hoicourt ne yahaan tak tippanee kar di ki raashtrapati koi raja nahin hota ki uske faisle kii samiksha nahin hogi
 While announcing Pranab Mukherjee's name, it was also said that he is experienced in political and constitutional matters
 shukr he in sabake bich pratibha patil yaad hi nahin aatin, wo bhi pehali mahila raashtrapati ke rup main master stroke thim
 The Congress wanted to make Narayanan a second time candidate, but the government was with the BJP and now had a new master stroke, APJ Abdul Kalam
 dalit ke saamne muslim pratik tha
 Many people say that the new symbol was brought in due to the initiative of the army to intervene during the Gujarat riots
 ridiff daat com ne 8 march 2005 kaa ke aar narayanan kaa ek intervyuu prakashit kiya he jo unhone malayalam kii masik patrika maanav samskruti ko diya tha
 In it, he said that the government and administration had support in the communal riots of Gujarat
 maine is maamle main pradhanmantri vaajapeyi ko bahut saare patr likhe magar unhone kuch nahin kiya
 KR Narayanan was a Dalit President but he was not a symbol President
 kya ramnath kovind ko sirf pratikon or master stroke tak simit karnaa sahi hoga
 Whereas he has proved himself as the Governor of Bihar
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar unki saraahna kar rahe hai
 He did not allow Raj Bhavan to become the hub of politics like Delhi
 ramnath kovind ne bihar chunaav se pehle 8 agast 2015 ko rajyapal ke rup main shapath lee or 18 agast ko aara kii us raily main haazir the jahaan pradhanmantri ne bihar ko sava lakh karod dene kii baat kahi thi
 The event was official, but the introduction of the governor had become a bit electoral
 bijepi phir se inhen paryaayavachi visheshnon kaa istamaal kar rahi he
 It did not bring electoral gains in Bihar, but Bihar got a good governor on this excuse
 kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne kaha he ki kovind dalit hai or inkaa jo virodh karegaa wo dalit virdohi hoga
 With this logic, one should not contest elections against Paswan ji or one should field candidates against BSP
 ramvilas paswan us kheme main kya kar rahe hai jahaan shivasena he jisane bharat ke pehle dalit raashtrapati kii ummidavaari kaa virodh kiya tha or tii en sheshan ko ummidavaar banaaya tha
 The comments yah sahi he ki maujuuda daliton ke bich nai tarah kii bechaini dikh rahi he
 Oppose Una incident or the political uproar after Rohit Vemula's suicide
 saharanpur kii ghatana ke baad bhim army kaa jantar mantar par do-do baar chal kar aana
 Somewhere there is Jignesh, somewhere there is Chandrashekhar, somewhere is Ratan Lal and somewhere there is Chandrabhan Prasad
 iske baad bhi bijepi ne kisi dalit chehre ko upi chunaav main saamne nahin kiya phir bhi aitihaasik jeet mili
 The political stakes of the Prime Minister should be discussed more than the background of Ramnath Kovind
 ki kahin unhone is naam se vipaksh ko bikher to nahin diya
 Many people have sympathy for LK Advani
 ab adwani ji ke liye duusare kyon bolen, ve khud bhi to bol sakate hai
 Not every time but in politics, one has to speak for sympathy and keep quiet for the post
 philhal kovind ji kaa swaagat kiijie
 He has experience of practicing in Delhi High Court and Supreme Court for sixteen years
 teen baar upiessi kii koshish kii magar iees main nahin hua to aapane elaed services chhod vakaalat kaa rasta apana liya
 Became private secretary to the then Prime Minister Morarji Desai in 1977, during which he came in contact with the BJP leadership
 1990 main bijepi ke tikat par ghatmpur loksabhaa se chunaav bhi lade magar haar gaye
 Was elected to the Rajya Sabha from UP in 1994 and was a member of the House until 2006
 2007 main kanpur dehaat kii bhoginipuri vidhansabha se chunaav lade magar basapa ke ummidavaar se haar gaye
 Before being made the Governor of Bihar in August 2015, he was the General Secretary of the UP BJP
 akhil bhartiya coli samaaj ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai or bijepi dalit morcha ke bhi adhyaksh rahe hai
 There are only two big master strokes in India's politics
 mahila, muslim, dalit or pichhadaa
 Scheduled tribe cards rarely run
 ho saktaa he up raashtrapati pad ke liye bachaa kar rakhaa gaya ho
 Like 2017, a similar master stroke was carried out by the Congress in 1997 when KR Narayanan's name was announced as the presidential candidate
 bijepi se lekar sanyukt morcha tak ne unki ummidavaari kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Will the Congress now give a return gift to the BJP? wo ek aitihaasik ghadi thi, pehali baar koi dalit bharat ke ganatantr ke shikhar par baithne ja rahaa tha
 No major party campaigned against Narayanan, except the Shiv Sena which made TN Seshan its candidate
 us vakt ke aar narayanan ko raashtrapati ke liye padane vaale kul 11,04,546 voton main se 9,56,290 vot mili the
 This was a record
 ke aar narayanan ne nyaaypalika ke saamne aise sawaal uthaa diye jise lekar ab tak chuppi thi or raashtrapati shashan kii siforeeshon par tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi se takaraa gaye
 You can read a report by Prabhu Chawla in India Today on 25 July 1999 on the Internet
 november 1998 main raashtrapati narayanan ne jajon kii niyukti kii file par on record tippanee kar di thi ki anusuchit jati or janajati ke yogya ummidavaar hote hue bhi nyaaypalika main unka pratinidhitiv kyon nahin he
 There was a lot of debate then
 aath saal baad yani 2006 main ke ji baalkrishnan bharat ke pehle dalit mukhya nyaayadhish banate hai
 Gopal Gandhi, whose candidature was short-lived this year, was Secretary to President KR Narayanan
 unhone raashtrapati kii taraf se colegium kii file par likhaa tha ki jaj tabadale se lekar apane tamaam nirnyon ke bare main aapatti yaa sahmati likhit rup main darj karen
 In October 1998, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet recommended imposition of President's rule in Bihar, Narayanan returned after 80 hours of consideration saying that the government should reconsider as he does not think there is a constitutional crisis in Bihar
 ab is kadam kii tulana aap uttarakhand or arunachal pradesh main raashtrapati shashan kii sifarish par maujuuda raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke dastakhat se kar lijie
 Both decisions were rejected by the courts, but the High Court of Uttarakhand even remarked that the President is no king that his decision will not be reviewed
 pranab mukherjee ke naam kaa elaan hote vakt bhi kaha gaya tha ki ve raajnneetik or sanvaidhanik maamalon ke anbhavi hai
 Thankfully, Pratibha Patil is not remembered among them, she was also the master stroke as the first female President
 narayanan ko congress duusari baar bhi ummidavaar bananaa chaahati thi magar sarkaar bijepi kii thi or uske paas ab ek nayaa master stroke tha e pi je abdul kalam
 Dalit had a Muslim symbol in front of him
 kai log kehete hai ki gujarat dangon ke dauraan sena ke hastkshep kii pahal karne ke kaaran nayaa pratik laayaa gaya
 Riddif
com has published an interview of KR Narayanan on 8 March 2005 which he gave to the Malayalam monthly magazine Human Culture
 isamen unhone kaha he ki gujarat ke sampradayik dangon main sarkaar or prashasan kaa samarthan tha
 i wrote a lot of letters to Prime Minister Vajpayee in this matter but he did nothing
 ke aar narayanan dalit raashtrapati the magar ve pratik raashtrapati nahin the
 Would it be correct to restrict Ramnath Kovind to just symbols and master strokes
 jabaki bihar ke rajyapal ke rup main ve khud ko sabit kar chuke hai
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is applauding him
 unhone rajbhavan ko dilli kii tarah raajnneeti kaa adda nahin banane diya
 Ramnath Kovind was sworn in as Governor on 8 August 2015 before the Bihar elections and was present at the rally in Ara on 18 August where the Prime Minister had promised to give 1
25 lakh crore to Bihar
 yah kaarykram sarkari tha magar rajyapal kaa parichay thodaa chunavi ho gaya tha
 The BJP is again using these synonyms
 bihar main isse chunavi laabh to nahin hua magar is bahaane bihar ko ek acha rajyapal mila
 Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said that Kovind is a Dalit and anyone who opposes him will be anti-dalit
 is tark se to kisi ko paswan ji ke khilaaf chunaav hi nahin ladanaa chahie yaa bispi ke khilaaf kisi ko ummidavaar hi nahin utaarna chahie
 What is Ram Vilas Paswan doing in the camp where Shiv Sena is the one who opposed the candidature of India's first Dalit President and nominated TN Seshan
 tippaniyan It is true that there is a new kind of anxiety among the existing Dalits
 oona kii ghatana kaa virodh ho yaa rohit vemula kii khudakushi ke baad kaa raajnneetik hangaamaa
 After the incident in Saharanpur, Bhim Army came to Jantar Mantar twice
 kahin jignesh hai to kahin chandrashekhar hai, kahin ratan laal hai to kahin chandrabhan prasad hai
 Even after this, BJP did not reveal any Dalit face in UP elections, yet it won a historic victory
 ramnath kovind kii prishthbhumi se zyada pradhanmantri kii raajnneetik daanv kii charchaa honi chahie
 Whether he scattered the opposition with this name
 kai logon ko laalkrishna adwani ke liye sahanubhuti ho rahi he
 Now why should anyone speak for Advani ji, he can also speak himself
 har baar to nahin magar kai baar raajnneeti main sahanubhuti ke liye bolnaa padataa he or pad ke liye chup rahanaa padataa he
 For the time, welcome Kovind ji
 bharat kii raajnneeti main do chaar hi bade master stroke hai
 Women, Muslims, Dalits and Backward
 anusuchit janajati kaa card kam hi chalata he

 KR Narayanan was a Dalit President but he was not a symbol President
 kya ramnath kovind ko sirf pratikon or master stroke tak simit karnaa sahi hoga
 Whereas he has proved himself as the Governor of Bihar
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar unki saraahna kar rahe hai
 He did not allow Raj Bhavan to become the hub of politics like Delhi
 ramnath kovind ne bihar chunaav se pehle 8 agast 2015 ko rajyapal ke rup main shapath lee or 18 agast ko aara kii us raily main haazir the jahaan pradhanmantri ne bihar ko sava lakh karod dene kii baat kahi thi
 The event was official, but the introduction of the governor had become a bit electoral
 bijepi phir se inhen paryaayavachi visheshnon kaa istamaal kar rahi he
 It did not bring electoral gains in Bihar, but Bihar got a good governor on this excuse
 kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne kaha he ki kovind dalit hai or inkaa jo virodh karegaa wo dalit virdohi hoga
 With this logic, one should not contest elections against Paswan ji or one should field candidates against BSP
 ramvilas paswan us kheme main kya kar rahe hai jahaan shivasena he jisane bharat ke pehle dalit raashtrapati kii ummidavaari kaa virodh kiya tha or tii en sheshan ko ummidavaar banaaya tha

 The political stakes of the Prime Minister should be discussed more than the background of Ramnath Kovind

 Many people have sympathy for LK Advani

 No major party campaigned against Narayanan, except the Shiv Sena which made TN Seshan its candidate

 You can read a report by Prabhu Chawla in India Today on 25 July 1999 on the Internet
 november 1998 main raashtrapati narayanan ne jajon kii niyukti kii file par on record tippanee kar di thi ki anusuchit jati or janajati ke yogya ummidavaar hote hue bhi nyaaypalika main unka pratinidhitiv kyon nahin he
 There was a lot of debate then

 unhone raashtrapati kii taraf se colegium kii file par likhaa tha ki jaj tabadale se lekar apane tamaam nirnyon ke bare main aapatti yaa sahmati likhit rup main darj karen
 In October 1998, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet recommended imposition of President's rule in Bihar, Narayanan returned after 80 hours of consideration saying that the government should reconsider as he does not think there is a constitutional crisis in Bihar

 Both decisions were rejected by the courts, but the High Court of Uttarakhand even remarked that the President is no king that his decision will not be reviewed
 pranab mukherjee ke naam kaa elaan hote vakt bhi kaha gaya tha ki ve raajnneetik or sanvaidhanik maamalon ke anbhavi hai
 Thankfully, Pratibha Patil is not remembered among them, she was also the master stroke as the first female President

 Would it be correct to restrict Ramnath Kovind to just symbols and master strokes

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is applauding him
 unhone rajbhavan ko dilli kii tarah raajnneeti kaa adda nahin banane diya
 Ramnath Kovind was sworn in as Governor on 8 August 2015 before the Bihar elections and was present at the rally in Ara on 18 August where the Prime Minister had promised to give 1
25 lakh crore to Bihar
 yah kaarykram sarkari tha magar rajyapal kaa parichay thodaa chunavi ho gaya tha
 The BJP is again using these synonyms
 bihar main isse chunavi laabh to nahin hua magar is bahaane bihar ko ek acha rajyapal mila
 Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said that Kovind is a Dalit and anyone who opposes him will be anti-dalit
 is tark se to kisi ko paswan ji ke khilaaf chunaav hi nahin ladanaa chahie yaa bispi ke khilaaf kisi ko ummidavaar hi nahin utaarna chahie
 What is Ram Vilas Paswan doing in the camp where Shiv Sena is the one who opposed the candidature of India's first Dalit President and nominated TN Seshan
 tippaniyan It is true that there is a new kind of anxiety among the existing Dalits

 Now why should anyone speak for Advani ji, he can also speak himself
 har baar to nahin magar kai baar raajnneeti main sahanubhuti ke liye bolnaa padataa he or pad ke liye chup rahanaa padataa he
 For the time, welcome Kovind ji

 america kii baat karen to vahaan 64GB iphone x kii keemat 999 dollar he

 mote taur par america kii tulana main tab aapako 21,000 rupee zyada dene pade
 This time, Indian users will have to pay 24,855 i
e
 about 25 thousand rupees more than the US for iphone X
 haalanki america kii keemton main tex jude nahin hote hai, jabaki bhartiya keemten tex jodne ke baad elaan kii jaati hai
 In some other countries except the US, the price of iphone x is lower than in India
 udhaaharan ke taur par hong cong main iphone x ke 256GB vairient kii keemat 9888 hong cong dollar he
 That is, it translates into rupees, then it is about 81,000 rupees
 bharat me is vairient kii keemat 1 lakh 2 hajaar rupee hogi yani vahaan se 20 hajaar se bhi zyada
 That is, you can go to Hong Kong for so much money and buy iphonex from there
 kolkata se hogg cogg ke liye round trip tikat kataayenge to lagbhag 17,000 rupee he

 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne sarvocch nyaayalay ko gumraah kiya jiske aadhaar par yah nirnay aayaa
 The government first told that the details of the price have been given to the CAG and the CAG investigated it and gave it to the Public Accounts Committee
 PAC ne bhi apni sampadit report sansad ko de di he
 Neither the PAC report came, nor did it go to the PAC
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne apni curative pitishan kaha he ki adlaat ne apane jajment main shabdon ko samajha nahin or 'is' kii jagah 'has been' ho gaya
 Sharma said that instead of apologizing to the Supreme Court, the government has questioned the English and grammatical information of the judges

 kangana ranut ne darjanon kamjor or badi flop filmein deen magar 'queen' kii safalataa ne maano unhen oonchaaiyon par pahunchaa diya
 It started to appear and it was said that Kangana could make the film a hit on her own
 kangana se badi koi star nahin, kangana se acchhee koi actress nahin
 Then i was thinking that the story and director who should get the credit for this success is getting all the credit to Kangana and finally the moment came when all the talk and praises of Kangana were left behind when the film was released 'revolver Queen 'and' finger '
 in donon filmon main kangana thim magar film ne box offis par pani nahin maanga
 That is, not a single show of Revolver Rani and Finger did not run properly in theaters and then Kangana's stardom was seen
 uske baad kangana kii ek or film ai 'tanu vaids manu riterns'
 It was a sequel to the hit film 'tanu Weds Manu'
 yah film bhi bahut badi hit hui or log phir sari credit kangana ko hi dene lage
 Even then, i thought that Anand l Rai, director of Tanu Weds Manu, deserves the credit for presenting the story of small towns in such a light way that the general audience gets connected to it
 film hit hoti he
 Anand l Rai has also made a super hit film with Sonam Kapoor without Bina Kangna, which was named 'ranjhana'
 magar tanu vaids manu riterns kii sari credit kangana ko de di gai
 The comments haalanki main queen ho yaa tanu vaids manu riterns, inase kangana ke achche yaa behtareen abhinay se inkaar nahin karata
 Kangna has acted brilliantly in these films, but cannot give all the credit for the success of these films to Kangana
 mujhe yaad he jab film 'katti batti' kaa pehla trailor jari kiya gaya tha tab kangana se sawaal puche ja rahe the kuch is tarah "aapako kisi hero kii jarurat hi nahin, aap to bina hero ke hi film ko hit kara detii hai?''
 
 vagairah vagairah
 But after the release of Katti Batti, both Kangana and the media got the answer that Kangana could not gather crowds at the box office
 kangana tabhi safal hai jab kahani kuch alag ho or damdaar ho
 Both of these films had Kangana but the film did not ask for water at the box office
 yani revolver rani or ungali kaa ek bhi sho cinemagharon main thik se nahin chalaa or tabhi dekhne ko mila kangana kaa staradam
 She was followed by another film by Kangana, 'tanu Weds Manu Returns'
 yah hit film 'tanu vaids manu' kaa sikval thi
 The film was also a big hit and people started giving all the credit to Kangana again
 tab bhi mere man main khyaal aayaa kii tanu vaids manu ke nirdeshak anand el raay is credit ke asal hakdaar hai jo chote shaharon kii kahani ko is tarah halake phulke andaaz main pesh karte hai ki aam darshak usase judaa hua paata he
 The film is a hit
 anand el raay bina kangana ke sonam kapur ke saath bhi super hit film bana chuke hai jiskaa naam tha 'ranjhna'
 But all credit to Tanu Weds Manu Returns was given to Kangana
 tippaniyan Although i do not rule out Kangana's good or best acting, Queen Ho or Tanu Weds Manu Returns
 kangana ne in filmon main laajawab abhinay kiya he, magar in filmon kii safalataa kaa sara shrey kangana ko nahin de saktaa
 i remember when the first trailer of the film 'katti Batti' was released, Kangana was being asked questions like "you don't need a hero, you make the film a hit without a hero?" '
 
 Et cetera et cetera
 magar katti batti kii release ke baad kangana or media donon ko jawaab mil gaya ki kangana bheed nahin juta sakati, box offis par
 Kangana is successful only when the story is different and strong
 uske baad kangana kii ek or film ai 'tanu vaids manu riterns'

 What is the tension in Uttar Pradesh's encounter police? To overcome this tension, he has to resort to religious leaders
 faijabad main puraa police amala tanaav ko dur karne ke liye ek dharmaguru kaa pravachan sunata dikhaa
 In Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh, there was a gathering of police officers and employees
 yahaan ek dharmaguru ke pravachan kaa kaarykram tha
 The religious leader is also very modern
 naam he swami dharmabandhu jo rahane vaale to urisa ke hai
 But their work place is Gujarat
 gujarat ke rajkot main inhone vaidic mishan trust kii sthapana kii he, vahaan se aae swami dharmabandhu inhen aparaadhiyon se nipatane, maansik tanaav ghataane or manobal badhaane kaa gyaan de rahe the
 Swami Dharmaguru said in his sermon that the person will never be stressed if he gets happiness by doing work
 lekin kaam karne se agar dukhi honge or dukhi man se karenge to koi ilaaj nahin milegaa
 In fact, is the encounter police of Uttar Pradesh so tense that they are being preached by religious leaders? If this is the case, then why the owner of Gujarat itself? And then who allowed such a big program? Is the UP police also being saffronised in Yogi Raj? Faizabad SSP Manoj Kumar is not openly saying from whose side was the order
 lekin itnaa samajhnaa mushkil nahin ki aise kaarykram bina upar ke aadesh yaa jaankaree ke nahin ho sakate jahaan jile kii police duty chhodkar pravachan sunne baith jaae

 aakhir shraddha kapur ko kisne kaha sabase khubasurat 'half garlfriend'vaise shraddha ye bhi maanati hai ki unhen rumours se koi fark nahin padataa
 But when it comes to the family, they do not take it lightly
