 The infighting has come to the surface inside the Congress in Gujarat
 raashtrapati chunaav main cross voting kii baat saamne aane ke 24 ghante ke andar shankar singh baghela baghawat par utar aae hai
 Vaghela called a gathering of his supporters on the pretext of birthday
 raily main waghela ne bada khulaasa kiya he ki unhen congress ne 24 ghante pehle hi party se nikaal diya he
 Vaghela said- i am in the party right now but it seems that the Congress party has fired me
 vinaash kaale viparit buddhi lekin baapu ritair hone vaala nahin he
 Vaghela said that i announce my resignation from the Congress and free the party from my side
 waghela ne congress par karaara hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki ve atmasamman se samjhauta nahin kar sakate
 Vaghela said that he has a long political history
 ve rashtriya swayamsevak sangh main bhi rah chuke hai
 Vaghela said that i can go anywhere but will not go to BJP
 unhone kaha, "maine vipaksh ke netaa ke rup main istipha de diya he rajyasabha chunaav ke baad main congress ke vidhayak ke rup main bhi istipha de duungaa
 i do not wear the Congress BJP flag
 kisi party kaa jhanda nahin pahananaa
 "supporting leaders have gathered at the event calling for Vaghela's birthday
 haalanki, congress ne apane netaaon se waghela ke kaarykram main jane ko manaa kiya he
 The Vaghela faction is being held responsible for cross voting in the presidential election
 isi saal hone vaale gujarat vidhansabha chunaav se pehle rajya main congress ko isse bada jhatka lag saktaa he
 Vaghela clearly said that he has no hand in cross voting but he also got NCP leaders to vote for Meera Kumar
 congress chhodane kii baat kahi thi?is bich, ek badi khabar aa rahi he
 Yesterday Shankar Singh Vaghela met NCP leader Praful Patel

 On the other hand, Congress has asked its local leaders to stay away from Vaghela's birthday party

 In his response, Vaghela said that i have given my vote only to Congress candidate Meera Kumar
 baaki cross vot kisne kiya isaki jaanch karenge? He said that one thing also comes why the rules change again and again
 ye sarkaar janata-janardan ke liye he
 The government tries to get constant feedback from the public
 janata-janardan ko kahaan kathinaayee ho rahi he, kis niyam ke kaaran dikkat aati he, uskaa kya rasta khoja ja saktaa he
 Being a sensitive government every moment changes all the rules that have to be changed keeping in mind the convenience of the people, so that the problems of the people are reduced

 Amidst the apathy of the party and opposition, the unemployed also do not understand what to do with their issues
 20 march ke indian express main je majumdaar kii khabar chhapi he
 According to this news, there has been a rapid decline in the number of work force
 paanch saal pehle kii tulana main is vakt kam log kaam par lage hue hai
 For the first time since 1993-94, there has been a decline in the work force
 NSSO ne 2017-18 ke liye Periodic Labour Force Survey kiya tha, yah report saarvajanik nahin hui he
 Accordingly, in 2012-13, the work force of men is 30
 4 karod tha jo 2017-18 main ghatakar 28
 6 crores
 mardon ke work force main itani giravat 1993-94 ke baad pehali baar dekhi gai he
 6 in the work force of men in villages

 This is enough

 According to this data, more than 40 million jobs have ended
 2011-12 se 2017-18 ke bich
 You can understand how terrible unemployment has become
 kya is vakt berojgaare par bahes nahin honi chahie
 Not only for the Congress BJP, but what we have done that has made unemployment so frightening and whether we are going to do it, do our political parties really have any idea that there can be a solution for unemployment
 yah sawaal agar halke main nahin liya gaya to agle paanch saalon ke liye berojgaar khud ke saath ninsaphi karenge
 The unemployed and the young have to force all leaders to come to the question of unemployment
 apana blueprint bataaen
 Mahesh Vyas of the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy constantly writes on unemployment figures
 mahesh vyas ne bijness standard main likhaa ki berojgaare kii dar un yuvaaon main adhik he jo chhathi se lekar snaatak hai
 Those who are not educated at all, are getting work
 mahesh vyas ne bataaya he ki bie or eme paas karne vaale yuvaaon ke bich sitambar se disambar 2018 ke bich berojgaare kii dar 13
 2 percent
 ek saal pehle yah dar 12
 Was 1 percent
 10veen or 12veen paas karne vaale naujavaanon ke bich berojgaare kii dar 10
 6 percent
 naujavaanon ko kaam nahin mil rahaa he is kaaran unhone kaam kii talash bhi chhod di he
 Hence the labor participation rate in India is very low
 maatr 43 pratishat
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra has spoken to Mahesh Vyas
 aap hindi akhbaar padhate honge, channel dekhte honge kya unamem aisi jaankariyaan di jaati hai
 This is also a question
 kya berojgaaron se sambandhit adhyayanon ko media kii report se gaayab kiya ja rahaa he
 You know that in the past few days the recruitment examination of Group d and Loco Pilot took place in Railways
 di vir ke patrkaar arun das ne bataaya he ki railway main helper banane ke liye bie paas or eme paas naujavaanon ne bhi applai kiya he
 While the eligibility was only 10th
 82 lakh ummidavaar ucch shiksha praapt the

 kareeb 17 lakh ummidavaar hi aise the jinke paas sirp 10veen kii yogyata thi
 Railways had claimed that 2 crore applications were received
 ye haalat he
 There is no employment for educated people
 har din berozegaron ke massej aate hai
 Ideally there should have been a serious debate on this issue
 is chunaav main jo mudde hai unka berojgaare se koi sambandh nahin lagata he, lekin is sthiti se kab tak bachaa ja sakegaa
 We showed in prime time on March 19 that a primary school in Ballia has been painted in such a way that it has started appearing like a BJP flag

 inkaa kahana he ki media kaa kawarej nahin ho rahaa he par inase sawaal poocha janaa chahie ki ye log jab news channel dekhte hai to kya dekhte hai? kya ve aisi khabaron ko gambhirtha se or sabase pehle padhate hai?chunaav ke samay do tarah kii ladaai chalati he
 Political parties want the public to be judged on their framing issue
 janata apane muddon ko lekar yahaan vahaan bhatakati rah jaati he
 Every day she watches the debate of news channels as her issues and when she understands her issue, she looks for Whats app number
 aaj whats ap massej aae hai

 Today, a teacher from Bihar received a message that i am from Bihar Banka district
 main middle skool main teacher hum
 We have not received salary for the last 5 months
 ghar chalaanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Request from you to show this matter in prime time
 is catagori ke paune teen lakh shikshak hai
 After sending the message, he got another message that just two months salary has come
 to isi tarah se inkaa jivan katataa he
 Employed teachers also have not received salaries for several months
 shukr he ki ye sab mudde nahin hai
 Otherwise you would be asking who is happy
 ek puri suchi ban sakati he ki kin-kin vibhaagon main 5 maheene se selary nahin mili he
 Then these people can have a survey of what they like to see in the media
 kya apni takalif ko lekar eemaandaar hai yaa phir un sapanom main kho jate hai jo kahin or kisi kaarkaane main tay kiye jate hai
 These stories show how governments are actually running
 in muddon ke kaaran bahut kuch seekhney ko miltaa he

 shivasena ne kaha he ki narendra modi kaa ‘shauchalay pehle, baad main devalayas’ vaala bayaan yah dikhaata he ki bijepi apane pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke vichaar ke sampark main nahin he
 The editorial of Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana' said, "modi is actually saying what Jairam Ramesh has been saying earlier
 congress ko shauchalay pariyojna ke liye modi ko brands ambeseder niyukt kar dena chahie
 
 
 "the editorial says," Modi has received criticism for the toilet comment
 unhone ‘jai shriram’ kii bajaay ‘jai jairam’ kaha, jiske baad party main is bare main sawaalon se bachane ke prayaas shuru ho gaye
 'it says,' The picture is that Modi is leading and the BJP is following
 ham kya kah sakate hai? sabhi ko shauchalay nirmaan kaary main shaamil hona chahie
 As far as temple construction is concerned, we will see it later
 ’sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘modi ne ‘pehle shauchalay, baad main devalayas’ vaali tippanee se ek saahsee vichaar saamne rakhaa he
 It is surprising that the Congress attacked him for this
 ’sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘pehle jab ramesh ne apane vichaar rakhe the tab bijepi, viechpi or sangh parivaar ne unki aalochana kii thi
 Now BJP leaders are defending Modi
 ’ sampadakeey main aage kaha gaya he ki yadi modi or ramesh un sthanon par vidhyalay or saarvajanik suvidhaon ke nirmaan kii ghoshnaa karte hai, jahaan avaidh masjiden or madrase khadey hai, to yah vastav main dharmanirpekshata kaa mantra hoga
 What did Narendra Modi say? 
 
 narendra modi ne gat 2 oktober ko yuvaaon ke liye yojit ek kaarykram main kaha tha, ‘shauchalay pehle banaao, devalayas baad main
 Modi said that despite his image being that of a Hindutva leader, he has the courage to say this
 uddhav kar chuke hai modi kaa samarthanauddhav thakare ne haal main modi ko bijepi kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaye jane kaa swaagat kiya tha or kaha tha ki ‘samudra manthan’ ke baad amrit niklaa he

 ’ In retaliation for the Pulwama attack, the Indian Air Force has entered into Pakistan and carried out an air strike
 vayusena ke miraj vimaan ne aatanki sanghathan jaish--e-mohammad ke thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaaya he or is karrwai main 200-300 aatankiyon ke dher hone kii ashanka he
 Launch pads at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balakot, Muzaffarabad and Chakoti in Pakistan have been targeted by India
 vayusena kii air strike par pratikriya dete hue jammu kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne twit karte hue pehle to vaayu sena kii is karrwai par sawaal uthaae lekin sthiti saaf hote hi kuch minuton ke bheetar unke sur badal gaye or unhone is oparation ko sargical strike se bhi badi karrwai qaraar diya he
 We've entered a whole new paradigm with the Balakote air strike
 The post Uri strike was to avenge our losses, Balakote was a “preemptive strike to prevent an imminent jem attack”
 Totally new ballgame
 — Omar Abdullah (@omarabdullah)february 26, 2019umr ne twit karte hue likhaa ki 1971 ke baad pehali baar shanti kaal main pakistan ke khilaaf air strike kii gai he, pehali baar prabhavi, gyaat taur par sena kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 At the same time, he said that we have set a new example with Balakot air strike, after Uri the surgical strike was our revenge, but the Balakot strike destroyed the plans of Jaish
 isse pehle apane twit main umr ne kaha tha ki agar yah oparation khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa ke balakot main hua he to vaaki majboot air strike he
 But if it happened in Balakot in Poonch sector, then only symbolic action
 kyonki is vakt aatankiyon ke forward launch pad khaali rahete hai or kaam nahin kar rahe hote
 If this is Balakote in KPK it's a major incursion & a significant strike by IAF planes

 kya shaareerik sambandh banaate samay aap ke dimag main baicheni rahati he ki kahin koi kaan laga kar aapaki awaajen na sun rahaa ho? isi baicheni ke chalate aap na to khud santusht ho pate hai, na hi apane partner ko khush kar pate hai
 This often happens, sometimes due to the presence of many people in the house or because the bedroom is adjacent to the bedroom of another member of the house
 kahin aisa to nahin ki in pareshaaniyon ke chalate aap jaayaka badhaane vaali aahen lene ke liye hi aap aahen bharte rahete hai
 If so, here are some effective tips for you
 puri tarah silband hua jaebazar main jhankkar to dekhen
 You will find many solutions to your problem
 daravaajon se aawaaj baahar jaati he, to khud chup rahane kii bajaae apane daravaajon kaa munh band kar den, yani un par laga den sil
 From the very bottom of the door to the top, seal every place where there is a possibility of going out
 ek baat kaa khaas dhyaan rakhen, sil lagane ke baad kamare kii battiyaan bujhaakar dekh len ki baahar kii roshni kahin darvaaron se bheetar to nahin aa rahi
 If light can come in from any place, then the path is clear for the voice too
 use bhi band kar den
 Bennett Brooks, president of Saharabrooks Acosti Corporation, says slow music says that many unwanted sounds occur during relationships, such as the bed's head hitting the wall or the spring-raised mattress
 in awaajon ko aap chaahakar bhi nahin roak sakate
 To avoid these, light music can also be played in the room
 isse ek to awaajon ke baahar jane kii chintaa se mukt ho jaaenge or doosraa ke sambandhon kaa jaayaka bhi badhegaa
 There are other means of rescue
 
 
 bazaar se mote staf vaali chataayee khariden or use daravaaje ke thik peeche laga den
 Its avalanche pillow or blanket is also a good option
 agar aapke ghar main chote bachche hai or aap is baat se darate hai ki raat ke sannaate main ve aap kii baat na sun len, to apane shower ko khol den
 The sound of the shower will not let the attention of the children come towards you
 bas, ab dar kis baat kaa? It is the fundamental right of every citizen to hoist the national flag of India, but not all citizens can put this tricolor on their vehicle
 bhartiya jhanda samhita 2002 ke mutabik sirf sanvaidhanik padon par baithe kuch chuninda logon ko hi apane vaahan main tirangaa fahraane kii ijaajat he
 Before 2004, only the government departments, offices and educational institutions were allowed to hoist the tricolor, but in the Government of India v
 Naveen Jindal case in 2004, the Supreme Court said that every Indian has the fundamental right to hoist the tricolor
 yah adhikaar sabhi nagarikon ko samvidhan ke anuchhed 19 ke tahat diya gaya he
 After this, all citizens got the right to hoist the tricolor
 haalanki ab bhi naagarik apni gaadi par tirangaa lagaakar nahin gum sakate hai
 If a common citizen hoists the tricolor on his vehicle, it is illegal
 aise logon ke khilaaf karrwai kii ja sakati he
 Apart from the vehicle, the tricolor will not be hoisted above, beside or behind the train, boat and aircraft
 agar koi aisa karata he, to yah gaiyr kanoonee hoga
 Let us know which people have got the right to hoist the tricolor on their car
 koun apni gaadi main laga saktaa he tirangaa?1

 dilli ke food sefti kamishnar ne ise lekar notification jari kiya he This notification of April 13 states that this ban is being imposed for the next one year in the public interest in view of public health, but when Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain was asked about this, he said that "the last tobacco This is only an extension of the notification given by the government regarding the ban because the time of notification was running out

 Even though the Congress is considering this bill a victory of its anti-corruption resolution
 sansad ke andar or baahar bill kaa virodh jari he
 But the Congress is completely satisfied with this bill and the party says that it is ready to fight
 sutron se pataa chalaa he ki sarkaar chaahati he bahes ke dauraandusre dalbhi bill virdohi sabit hon
 If the bill is not passed then the blame is not on the government but on the Parliament
 sarkaar hangaame or sansadeey niyamon kii aad kaa phayda uthaane kii ranneeti par bhi vichaar kar rahi he
 If this is true, then the government must be thinking that by doing so, it will defer the bill for the next year
 aise main puure vivaad main anna ke virodh kii talwaar keval congress par nahi giregi
 Congress has divided the Synopsis of the bill to its mps
 saaf he ki party chaahati he bill ko lekar jab sansad main bahes ho to uske log apana paksh rakhane ko puri tarah se taiyaar rahen
 Winter session has been extended for three days to discuss the Lokpal
 chuttee ke baad 27, 28 or 29 disambar ko bhi sansad chalegi
 The bill that the government has prepared on Team Anna Narajalokpal from the government bill, will be introduced in Parliament today
 haalanki is bill se naa team anna khush he or naa vipaksh
 But the government claims that it will pass it in this session
 haalanki sansad se sadak tak sangram kii taiyaari he
 The work which could not be done in the last 43 years is now to be done
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf bharat main sabase bade kanoon ke liye sansad main aaj pesh ho jayega bill
 a bill that has been in movement for the last 9 months
 ek aisa bill, jisaki maang ne desh bhar main paidaa kar diya jan-aakrosh
 Such a bill, which many times the central government was unaware of
 ek aisa bill, jiske liye anna teen baar anshan kar chuke hai or chauthe anshan kii taiyaari he
 The government has now prepared a bill, altering the Standing Committee report
 lekin, jo bill taiyaar hua he, usapar naa team anna khush he or naa hi vipaksh
 The team Anna, who has raised the voice for the Lokpal, rejects the Anna Lokpal of the Team Anna government
 lekin sarkaar kaa daawa he ki usne jo-jo vaade kiye tha, wo saare puure kar rahi he
 But, Team Anna, who has opened a front against the government, has also started to accuse that in fact the government does not care about the people, it does as much as Sonia and Rahul ask them to do
 sonia ne sambhala morchalokapal ke maujuuda bill ke liye sonia kii sah vaali baat ko majboot karata he sansadeey dal baithak main unka bhaashan, jisamen unhone lokapal ko duusari sarkari yojanaon ke saath kikha or chunavi rang diya
 Sonia said that Congress has now done more than the 2009 election manifesto
 kul milakar halaat yahi hai ki pichley har baar kii tarah hi is baar bhi lokapal kii raah main kai adnge hai
 The bill has not even been introduced in the Lok Sabha and the process has started
 congress kehane main lagi he ki sarkaar gambhir he or bijepi ko ye lagata he ki sarkaar chalane vaali nahin he
 Obviously, the question now arises as to what will happen to this Lokpal
 kya 2011 main bhi ye kanoon ban paaegaa or agar banegaa, to kaisaa banegaa
 The government's secret strategy: The government's strategy is clear that even the snake dies and the sticks do not break
 jo bill bana he, usapar vipaksh ne hangaamaa shuru kar diya he
 In such a situation, there is a possibility that the bill could hardly be passed in the next three days
 jaahir he, sarkaar ye jataane kii koshish main he ki wo to gambhir he
 But the rest also have responsibility
 sonia kii shah par sarkaar ne anna ko maat to de di
 But she also has to save Sonia from changing the bill within the Parliament
 aise main sadan ke bheetar sarkaar kii ranneeti badi pechida he jisase wo ek tir se kai nishane sadhana chaahati he
 The government wants that in the next three days, other parties other than that also prove to be anti-bills
 bill paas na ho to dosha sarkaar par nahin sansad par aae
 According to information received from the sources, the government is also considering a strategy to take advantage of the ruckus and the cover of parliamentary rules
 agar ye baat sach he to sarkaar soch rahi hogi ki aisa karke wo bill ko agle saal tak ke liye taal de
 In such a situation, the sword of opposition to Anna in the entire dispute will not fall only on the Congress
 is ranneeti kii kuch aahat sansad main dekhne sunne ko mili hai

 i am Ravish Kumar
 padma sachdev hai, jammu kashmir se aati hai or mashhoor sahityakar hai
 i asked him that you saw such devastation in Jhelum
 unka jawaab tha baadh to dekhi he, magar bahut baadh nahin dekhi he
 To me, that river looks like a dull cow
 dhire-dhire bahati he
 Like Chenab, there is no movement in it
 jhelum naam to pakistan ke punjab ke ek kasbe se padaa he, jiske kinare se jhelum guzarati he
 Jhelum is also one of the old rivers of the Indian subcontinent, also known as Vittasta
 kashmir main iskaa apbhransh naam vyath bhi he
 Like you speak agony
 is nadi ke aachaar vyavhaar ke bare main hamane varisht patrkaar jawahar laal kaul se bhi poocha
 He also explored his memories and said that Jhelum is a very calm river
 isamen baadh to aati thi magar ye hamaare angan main aise ghusati thi, jaise anumati lekar ai ho
 Kaul Saheb said that this is the great disaster after independence
 90 ke dashak main srinagar main baadh ai thi, magar uskaa scale bahut chota tha
 Doodh Ganga, a tributary of the Jhelum or Vitasta which joins the Jhelum near Srinagar, became furious and broke the dam
 kaul sahab ne yah bhi kaha ki srinagar kii jo dal lake he, uskaa str jhelum se upar tha
 Dal water used to go to Jhelum, but now water of Jhelum has started coming into Dal
 jin logon ne jammu or srinagar ko dekha he ve bataa rahe hai ki pachaason pulon kaa bah janaa bataa rahaa he ki log bhul gaye the ki is rajya main nadiyaan bhi bahati hai
 Hundreds of kilometers of roads have been washed away
 hamaari ejineering se lekar prabandhan tak kii pole khul gai he
 After all, why did the calm flowing Jhelum become so fierce? Why is she causing panic like Kosi? Take the name of any locality in Srinagar
 jammu ke aas-paas ke kai jile baadh kii chapet main hai
 There is also loss of life and property in Poonch, Rajouri, Udhampur
 das lakh log prabhavit bataae ja rahe hai
 The city of Jammu has lost contact with Pathankot
 prashasan ne tavi nadi par bane teen pulon ko band kar diya
 Damage has also been reported in the fourth bridge
 tabaahi itani vyapak he ki bina sena ke kuch nahin ho saktaa tha
 The army has done excellent work
 sena or andiaref ne milakar visham paristhitiyon main raahat evam bachaav kaa kaam kiya he
 Nearly 30,000 people have been evacuated to safer places
 yah oparation pichley saal ke kedarnath haadase kii tarah to nahin he, magar kaaphi bade str par chal rahaa he
 At one time, the water level in Ram Munshi Bagh of Srinagar went up by twenty five feet
 yah aitihaasik he
 After 17 feet the flood is considered here
 agar ram munshi baag main jal str 26 feet gaya to dal main pani bhar jayega, jo pehle se hi bharaa hua he
 Apart from Ram Munshi Bagh, the water level in Sangam Ashram is measured
 teenon jagahon par scale hi dub gaya he
 In Sangam too, the water level is flowing tens of feet above the target of danger
 kai jagahon se pani ke kam hone kii khabar aa rahi he, lekin ab yahaan pani badha to dal or jhelum kaa pani milakar srinagar ko gaharaa nuksaan pahunchaa denge
 Silt has accumulated on the roads here
 hoicourt, sachivalay, laal chowk sab dub chuke hai
 Hospitals are also drowned and the way to reach them
 raahat kii baat itani he ki srinagar main pani ke kam hone kii khabaren aane lagi hai, phir bhi kuch ilaakon main kaaphi pani jamaa he
 Even today it has not rained, yet the danger is not averted
 badi maatra main jammu-kashmir ko raahat saamagree kii zarurat he
 Boats have been delivered from Patna, Gandhinagar, Ghaziabad and Delhi
 kanpur se tambu
 23 Air Force aircraft and 29 helicopters are engaged in continuous rescue operations
 1992, 95 or 96 main bhi baadh ai thi, lekin in varshon kii tulana main is baar das−das feet pani zyada bah rahaa he to aap kalpana kar sakate hai ki jhelum or uski sahaayak nadiyaan kitne gusse main hai
 The Meteorological Department has said that from today onwards, there will be light rain in Jammu and Kashmir, but not torrential
 ho saktaa he isse kuch raahat pahunche magar jo afat aa chuki he usase nipatna aasaan nahin he
 Roads have been swept across the state
 kai zilon kaa aapas main or srinagar kaa kai zilon se sampark tut gaya he
 How much damage has been caused to the state due to the torrential rains for six days can not be immediately estimated
 phone, bijli or pine ke pani kii supplai sab thapp hai
 The army and the NDRF operate from satellite phones
 udhampur ke ek gaanv main bhuskhalan ke kaaran bees se zyada ghar bah gaye
 More than 30 villagers got buried in the rubble
 hamaare news room main lagaataar log phone kar soochna de rahe hai ki unke apane srinagar yaa jammu main kahaan kahaan fanse hai
 The rescue squad still could not reach all the people
 logon ke paas zaruri chizein samaapt ho chuki hai
 Right now, when the entire state is stuck in floods, and the central states are trying to reach people together, we would just like to know what happened there? Was there any specific change that Jhelum submerged Srinagar
 saath saal main aisi baadh kii naubat kyon ai? raahat or bachaav ke liye abhi kya kuch kiya ja saktaa he? The Prime Minister has declared this national disaster
 zaahir he tabaahi itani hui he ki isse ubarne main jammu kashmir ko kai maheene lag jaaenge

 The sooner you read this report, the sooner the road will swallow a person's life
 or kam se kam teen chaar jagahon par sadak haadase main logon kaa khun sadak par bah chukaa hoga
 We have probably become so accustomed to the news of the road accident in newspapers and TV on the day that we do not mind until someone becomes a victim of such an accident
 lekin centre sarkaar ke parivahan vibhaag ne guuruuvaar ko jo report jari kii he, wo itani bhayanak tasviir pesh karti he ki use padhakar aapkaa dil dahal jayega
 Highlights of the report titled Road Accidents in India - 2015: - There are 1374 road accidents in India every day in which 400 people are killed
 -sirf pichley ek saal main kareeb dedh lakh log sadak haadason main jaan ganvaa baithe
 The number of those injured was more than five lakhs
 -duniya main sadak haadason ke maamle main hamaari haalat kitni buree he, iskaa andaja aap is baat se laga sakate hai ki 2015 main bharat main paanch lakh se zyada sadak haadase hue
 In Sweden, there was only one road accident in the last year
 -khatarnaak baat ye he ki sthiti sudharne ke bajaay or bigadati ja rahi he
 Number of deaths in road accidents 4 in 2015 instead of 2014
 6 fisadi bad gai
 54% of those who died were less than 34 years old
 haadase kam karne main naakaam rahe ham: garkareeis report ko jari karte hue parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne khud ye mana ki unka mantralay sadak haadason ko kam karne main naakaam rahaa he or is disha main jo bhi kadam unhone uthaae he uskaa philhal koi asar nahin hua he
 Gadkari said that he is very sorry to present this report because as many people of the country are dying in the road accident, not many people die in any war and terrorist incident
 over speeding se sabase zyada haadase!mantralay ke parivahan anusandhan vibhaag ne is report ko taiyaar karne ke liye yah pataa lagaaya ki itane adhik sadak haadason kii vajah kya he or koun si jagahen sadak haadason ke hisaab se sabase zyada khatarnaak hai
 For this, the details were sought from all state governments, police and other agencies
 pataa chalaa ki 100 main se 77 sadak haadason main gaadi chalaane vaale kii hi galati hoti he
 And in that too, the most accident occurred due to over speeding
 lekin khud gadakari ne kaha ki gaadi chalaane waalon par galati madh dena sabase aasaan he
 According to him, there are many places where there are frequent accidents at the same place and the lack of road design is a big reason for this
 parivahan mantralay ne ab desh bhar main faile 726 blike spots kii pahchaan kii he jahaan baar baar haadase hote hai
 The ministry has now started talking to the state governments to repair the road design at these places
 pichley saal sabase zyada haadase mumbai main2015 main sabase zyada sadak haadase to mumbai main hue lekin sabase zyada logon ne dilli kii sadakon par jaan gavaayin
 The wide, bright-looking roads of Delhi swallowed the lives of 1622 people
 rajyon kii baat karen to uttar pradesh kii sadake sabase khatarnaak hai jahaan pichley saal 17,666 logon kii jaane sadak haadason kii bhent chadh gai
 Two-wheelers were the highest casualties among these deaths
 doosraa number auto rickshaw savaar logon kaa tha
 Fake license is also responsible
 It has also come out that fake driving license is also a major reason for road accident
 ek bada kaaran ye bhi saamne aayaa he ki desh kii kuch sadakon par hi jarurat se zyada trephic kaa boj he
 Only 2 percent of the country's roads are on which 40 percent traffic is burdened
 gadakari ne daawa kiya ki sarkaar ab 27 kilometre pratidin kii raftaar se sadak bana rahi he jisase sadak haadason main kami aegi
 The government has also formulated a plan to work with mps to identify black spots not known for accidents
 pahari ilaakon me sadakon par khaas tarah ke krash barier bhi lagaae jaaenge jisase vaahanon ke khai main girane jaisi ghatnaayen roki ja sakengi

 Dey said she was a patriotic Indian and felt "severely insulted" by Basit's claims
 basit ko 2014 main bharat ke liye pakistan kaa ucchayukta niyukt kiya gaya tha or vah chaar saal tak is pad par rahe
 In a video interview surfaced on Twitter, Basit claimed that after Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani was killed in July 2016, pellet guns were used on protesters and some economic barriers were imposed which no journalist wrote about
 basit ne daawa kiya ki kashmir ke aatm nirnay ke adhikaar ke paksh main lekh likhavane ke liye kisi bhi bhartiya patrkaar ko rajamand karnaa unke liye chunauteepurn tha jab tak ki unki mulaakaat de se nahin hui jinhone is par 'sahmati' jataai or unhone apane ek stambh main likhaa, “ab is mudde ko janamat sangrah ke madhyam se hameshaa ke liye sulajhane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 Reacting to the sensational claims of the former ambassador, Dey said in a video on Twitter that he would have generally ignored this comment without reacting, but it is very important to expose the lies
 unhone kaha, “khaskar tab jab yah ek nindaneey vyakti kii ore se kiya gaya ho jo na sirf mujhe balki bharat ko bhi badnaam karne ke liye kahani bana rahaa ho
 " saudi arab or kuch anya deshon kii ore se katar ke saath rishte tod liye jane ke baad khadi kshetra main gahraae sankat ke bich katari videsh mantri ne aaj baatcheet kaa aahvaan kiya or kaha ki america ke saath doha kaa rishta pehle kii mafik majboot bana rahegaa

 The first Test match between India and England was played in 1932 and the match was won by England by 158 runs
 shuruaati daur main england ke khilaaf bharat kaa pradarshan kuch khaas nahin tha or team ko sirf haar kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha

 As an opener for India, the captain contractor scored 86 runs while Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi scored 103 runs
 pataudi kaa test kariyar kaa yah teesraa match tha
 England's batsmen could not stand in front of India's spinner Salim Durrani's superb bowling and England were able to score only 281 runs in the first innings
 durrani england kii pehali pari ke chah wicket lene main safal rahe the
 India were dismissed for just 190 runs in the second innings
 is tarah england ke saamne 337 ran kii lakshya tha lekinpuri team sirf 209 ran par simat gai
 Under the captaincy of the contractor, India had the distinction of winning the match by 127 runs and winning the first Test series against England after 32 years
 durrani ne england kii duusari pari ke chaar ballebaazon ko pavilion lautaaya tha
 In this match he got 10 wickets in total
 madras bharat ke liye shubh sabit hua
 India also won their first Test match against England in Madras

 South Africa does not appear to be rid of this stamp

 His problems are not diminishing

 com / aty1dyetme — Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup) June 5, 2019 It is important for Team India to stay on top order, it is good news for India
 newjiland ke khilaaf abhyaas match main swing ke saamne bhartiya ballebaaj bikhar gaye the
 In such a situation, the absence of two main bowlers from South Africa will surely be a matter of relief for the Indian batsmen
 ab unke saamne cagiso rabada kii chunauti ahm hogi
 The rhythm of Indian batting depends heavily on the performance of the top-3
 in teen main se agar ek bhi ant tak khadey ho jaataa he to bharat kaa score acha hota he
 This has been seen in the last two years
 aise main rohit sharma-shikhar dhawan kii salaami jodi par acchhee shuruyaat kaa daaromadar he to viraat kohli par team ko sanbhaalane kii jimmedaari he

 com / zerropu97r— Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup) June 5, 2019 Rahul will be the number-4 There was a lot of discussion about the number-4 before the first choice World Cup
 bangladesh ke khilaaf abhyaas match main lokesh rahul chauthe number par khele the or shatak jamaaya tha
 In such a situation, it is believed that Kohli will send his favorite Rahul at least in the first match, otherwise Kedar Jadhav is also an option for this place
 rahul agar chaar number par aate hai to jadhav 5 or phir mahendra singh dhoni 6 number par aa sakate hai
 Who will get a chance in Chahal and Kuldeep? Which two fast bowlers Kohli gets in bowling, it has to be seen
 kaaphi had tak sambhaavna he ki jasprit bumraah or bhubaneshwar kii kumaar kii jodi maidan par hogi, lekin mohammad shami kii form ko dekhte hue kohli, kumaar kii jagah unhen mauka de sakate hai
 Bumrah is scheduled to play
 tisare tej gendbaaj ke rup main bharat ke paas hardik pandya kaa vikalp he
 It will also be interesting to see whether Kohli and head coach Ravi Shastri go with the pair of leg-spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav or give a chance to veteran all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja
 hashim amala kaa kharaab form badi pareshaanidakshin africa kii gendbaaji ko lekar chintaa nai he, lekin uski puraani chintaa uski ballebaaji he
 The team's batting is weak and apart from Quinton de Kock and captain Faf du Plessis, no other batsman seems to be in a position to play big innings
 anbhavi jepi jepi dumini or david miller shuruyaat to acchhee karte hai, lekin use anjaam tak nahin pahunchaa pate
 Hashim Amla is unable to get out of bad form
 dusen ne england ke khilaaf ardhashatak jamaaya tha to markeram ne bangladesh ke khilaaf acchhee pari kheli thi
 Playing XI: India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli (captain), KL Rahul, MS Dhoni (wicketkeeper), Kedar Jadhav, Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jaspreet Bumrahdakshin Africa: Quinton de Cock (wicketkeeper) ), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis (captain), Rasi van der Dussain, David Miller, JP Duminy, Andile Fehlukwayo, Chris Morris, Cagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Tabrez Shamsi zaraa sochie, do mulkon ke bich jang chhidi he
 Both the soldiers of the country are fighting a war across
 tabhi ek mulk kii sena kam pad jaati he
 The war is now in critical condition
 sena kii puri taadaad ho, to wo desh jang jeet saktaa he
 Even if there are no more soldiers to fight in his country
 bas paise hone chahie, kyonki unheen paison se wo kisi or desh se kiraye par army ko bulavaa saktaa he
 Yes, you might not believe it
 magar ye sach he ki ek bahut bada desh baqayada duniya ke kai deshon ko jang ladane ke liye kiraye par apni sena detaa he
 The operation to expel ISIS militants in Syria is a reality
 is oparation kii ye tasviren sachhee hai
 Whether he is a terrorist of Baghdadi or not
 magar kya sach main ye syrian sena ke sainik hai? ji, is queshchan mark yani prashn vaachak chinh ko bahut sanjidagi se lijie
 Because in this, the whole story of that deception is hidden, which Russia is doing to the world
 inhone ukraine main koharaam machaaya
 They drove terrorists into Syria
 ye sainik nahin chhalaava hai
 These are hired soldiers
 bas, inaki itani hi pahchaan hai
 Anywhere
 kabhi bhi
 for anyone
 ladate hai
 They get money in return and they just listen to the orders
 koun hai ye
 They fought with the rebels in the war of Ukraine
 syria main inhone sena kaa saath diya
 They are now fighting in Sudan and Central African countries
 or jald hi ye libya kaa rukh karenge
 PMC is Wagoner's soldiers
 yani privet military contractor
 Russia has a private military company, which manufactures hired soldiers
 or apane client yani graahakon ke liye jang ladati he
 So far, it has created a furore by sending its soldiers there for the Russian Army, the Army of Novorossia, the Syrian Armed Forces and the Iranian Armed Forces
 jin dushmano par inhone paison ke badale kahar barsaaya unamem islamic state, al-nusra front, free sirian army or ukraine kii army shaamil he
 From 2011 to 2014, ISIS captured most of Syria
 aisa laga ki jaise damishq bhi ab bas raashtrapati bashar al asad ke haathon se nikalne vaala he
 And their coup is set
 magar sutron ke mutabik isi dauraan hui ek khufia deal
 This was the deal of these hired soldiers
 deal ke mutabik piemasi vegnar apane sainikon ko syria ke ran main bhejega jo syrian military ke saath milakar aatankiyon ko khadedenge
 Yes, the Wagner Company was given a considerable amount in return
 magar yakeen maniye saal 2014 main jaise hi vegnar ke sainikon ne syria kii dharti par kadam rakhaa
 Like the fighters of Baghdadi, there was an evening
 saal bhar ke andar kiraye ke in sainikon ne syria kii zamin ko in aatankiyon kii laashon se paat diya
 Alam has happened that except for a few places the feet of Baghdadi militants from all over Syria have been uprooted
 or baaki kaa kaam sirian army ne puraa kiya
 However, it was not known how many of his soldiers had been sent to the Syrian front by Wagoner
 magar itnaa zarur pataa chalaa ki hazaron sainikon ko maarane vaale uske sainikon main 18 maut kii maut bhi hui
 Wagoner soldier who fought in Syria says that our troops joined the battle of Palmyra
 pehle hamaari team ne yudhakshetra kaa muyna kiya or phir puri planning ke saath ham maidan main utre
 We killed thousands of terrorists
 magar hamaare 18 sainik bhi maare gaye
 In one year, we overcame the situation there and paved the way for the Syrian Army
 duusare deshon ke ulat rus main aisi privet sainya companiyaan legal hai
 The reason behind doing this is to deal with any emergency in case of war
 magar aadhikarik taur par roosi adhikari vegnar yaa aisi kisi duusari company ke astitv kii baat hi nahin maanate hai
 So it is far from believing that his hired soldiers contracted war in other countries
 raksha visheshgy powell felganhor ke mutabik zaahir taur par vegnar kaa astitv he
 And its so called volunteers have been seen in all those battlefields
 jahaan roosi sarkaar unhen bhejnaa chaahati he
 Donbas and Syria are examples of this
 magar inhen ligalised nahin kiya gaya he
 The Russian government may deny any such private army
 magar ab ek agency ke khulaase ke baad duniya ko pataa chal chukaa he ki yuddh kii taiyaari ke liye rus ne apane mulk main aisi kai privet army bana rakhi hai
 She also uses these private armies in those places
 jahaan antarrashtriya dabaav kii vajah se sidhe taur par wo apni senaayen nahin bhej sakati

 in donon filmon se ranbir kapur or ranvir singh ne sabit kar diya ki ve teen khan sitaron se agali peedi kii kaman sanbhaalane ja rahe hai
 There are very few similarities between these two
 31 varshiya ranbir hindi cinema ke sabase pratishthit parivaar ke sadsy hai, jabaki 28 varshiya ranvir kaa filmi duniya se koi naata nahin rahaa he
 He is the son of a Sindhi businessman who grew up dancing to the songs of Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda
 donon ke vyaktitv bhi ek-duusare ke bilkul vipareet hai
 Ranbir is a quiet and low-speaking star, while Ranveer is a man of recklessness and humor
 donon hi actaron ne apane kaam se sabit kar diya he ki ve jokhim uthaane se nahin ghabaraate
 Ranveer acted in the old-fashioned romantic story film Lootera
 is film ne box offis par bhale hi zyada kamai na kii ho lekin isamen unhone apni acting kaa loha jarur manavaa diya
 Ranveer says, “I am 150 crore

 "ranbir Kapoor plays the blunt and mischievous young man in Besharam

 Its message was clear that do not be part of the sheep, but make your own way
 film kii kamai kii chintaa kiye bina donon hi actaron ne apni alag pahchaan banaai
 Both these actors have come to Bollywood at a time when the story of the film has become more prominent than the star
 donon ne yah dikhaa diya he ki ve kisi romantic, acshan yaa kamedi star ke khaanche main bandhakar nahin rahanaa chaahate
 Instead, he wants to make his mark as a versatile artist
 2014 main donon kii do filmein aane vaali hai
 Ranveer is making his debut with the film Gunday, which will be full of action, theatricality and romance like the films of the 1970s
 agali he kil dil, jiskaa diarection unke ustad shaad ali kar rahe hai
 Both films are produced by Yash Raj Films
 isi production company ne unhen pehla mauka diya tha
 On the other hand, Ranbir seems ready to take the risk
 ve do anuraagon ke saath kaam kar rahe hai
 The first is Anurag Basu, with whom he is making the detective film Jagga Jasoos and the second is Anurag Kashyap, in whose film Bombay Velvet, he plays the street fighter of Bombay in the 1960s

 Among the heroines, Deepika Padukone in 2013 had four hit films — Race 2, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Chennai Express and Goliyon Ki Rasleela

 The 25-year-old Parineeti Chopra is at the forefront of the new heroines, who received a strong acting accolade last year in pure desi romance
 is saal unki teen filmein aa rahi hai—hansi to fansi, daavat-e-ishk or kil dil
 She says, "I don't want to be tied to an image
 main alag-alag role karnaa chaahati hum
 Parineeti does not live up to the Bollywood heroines' made-up image, slim, flamboyant and sexy - and with the intention of doing something new like Kajol and Rani Mukherjee, they rule the hearts of the audience
 ve kahati hai, “yah aasaan he kyonki darshak nae chehre chaahate hai lekin hamen khud ko sabit karnaa he kyonki ham abhi star nahin bane hai
 "in this way, Ranbir Kapoor, Ranveer Singh, Parineeti Chopra and Alia Bhatt are going to give a new shine to the screen of Hindi cinema
 haalanki unka kariyar abhi shuru ho rahaa he, lekin ve nae idia par kaam karne vaale nirdeshkon ke saath judakar jokhim lene ko taiyaar hai
 It is his passion that is leading him to success
 pariniti kahati hai, “main sochati thi ki jab tak koi bada star saath nahin hoga, tab tak mujhe film nahin milegi
 But my first four films were with new actors
 ” yah dekhakar lagata he ki bollywood kaa bhavishya ujjwal he

 India has hoped that by the end of this year, jaish-e-mohammed chief Masood Azhar will be declared an international terrorist
 sanyukt raashtra main bharat ke pratinidhi saiyad akbaruddin ne bataaya ki bharat is par dhairya ke saath kaam kar rahaa he or sabhi vikalpon par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 In a special conversation with our colleague 'india Today', Akbaruddin said, 'we are patient but working with many member countries
 hamen ummid he ki sadsy deshon kii sahyog se ham apane lakshya ko hasil kar paaenge or wo lakshya ek aatanki ko list main laana he jo ek aatanki sanghathan ko chalaa rahaa he
 We are half done and hope to get it done soon

 India took this step after the terrorist attack in Pathankot, whose mastermind was Masood Azhar
 china ne laga diya tha adngahalanki pakistan ke saath kareebi rishte rakhane vaale china ne isamen adnga laga diya tha
 Pakistan refused to proceed on this without giving any reason and China did it for the second time
 is saal disambar main china kii taraf se lagaai gai roak khatm ho jaaegi
 China must either support the allied countries or it can use its veto power to block this resolution
 disambar ke baad china nahin laga paaegaa adngasaiyad akbaruddin ne ummid jataai he ki is saal ke ant tak is maamle main teji aegi, kyonki masooj ajahar kaa sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad pehle se hi pratibandhit aatankwaadi saganthan he
 In such a situation, India's hopes of declaring Masood Azhar as a terrorist have also increased
 akbaruddin ne kaha, 'unhone (china) ne shuruyaat main 6 maheene ke liye technical hold ke liye kaha tha or iske baad unhone ise 3 maheene or badhaane ke liye kaha
 The three-month period ends at the end of this year

 ' is saal apane kavita sangrah 'chhilte hue apane ko' ke liye sahitya academy se sammanit nandakishor acharya beete teen varshon main academy sammaan praapt hindi ke sabase yuva lekhak hai- mahaj 74 saal ke
 Otherwise, last year the award was given to Chitra Mudgal of 75 years and Ramesh Kuntal Megh of 86 years before that
 darasal, pichley paanch-saat varshon se hindi main sahitya academy puraskaar jaise chute hue varishton ko phir se yaad karte hue die ja rahe hai
 This makes the sad thought that whether Hindi writers will also get the Majhola Award like Sahitya Akademi only if they have crossed 15, 20 or 25 years of retirement age? In the last 12 years, Uday Prakash is perhaps the only writer to have received this honor at the age of 60 years
 varanaa is daur main 90 paar ke lekhak bhi sammanit ho chuke hai
 If we look at the writers of other languages who have received the Sahitya Akademi honor, then this old age will be the destiny of Hindi only
 nishchay hi yah baat varisht lekhak nandakishor acharya yaa duusare lekhakon ke prati kisi hethi yaa avagya ke bhav se nahin kahi ja rahi, iskaa maqasad bas is tathy kii ore dhyaan kheenchna he ki hindi kii duniya apane moorddhanyon ko pahchaanane or manyata dene main na sirf shithilataa, balki sankeernata bhi baratati rahati he
 The result is that when the writer becomes old, when the respect for him like the Sahitya Akademi becomes meaningless, then he is conferred with the Sahitya Akademi
 nandakishor acharya ji kaa sach bhi yahi he
 His status is greater than the Sahitya Akademi
 ve hindi kii tejasvi or swabhimani parampara ke lekhak rahe hai
 He would never have felt favorable to his dignity, asking for something for himself or even realizing his worthiness
 to hindi kii duniya unhen suvidhapurvak kinare karti chali gai- shaayad isaki ek vajah yah bhi ho ki ve hindi kii vam parampara se bhi baahar khadey hai or dakshinpanth ke bhi viruddh hai
 He was originally a writer of Gandhian and socialist beliefs, having intellectual connections and literary companionship to a great writer like Agyeya
 ve 'chauthaa saptak' ke kaviyon main shaamil rahe, haalanki yah saptakon main sabase kam saraahaa gaya or isi ke saath saptakon kii parampara bhi nickshesh ho gai
 But Nandkishore Acharya was in many ways the unique poet, writer and thinker of Hindi
 unka gadhy multah tarkashrith rahaa, lekin aakraamak nahin, bahut sahaj dhang se vichaar karata hua- or zarurat padane par ras letaa hua bhi
 'agyeya ki Kavya Titirsha' is a lovely book to understand his prose, his criticism and thought process
 is kitaab main ve marmajna, rasagrahi aalochak ke taur par ubharate hai
 If you look at the opulent creations of Nandkishore Acharya, then he seems basically a poet
 kam se kam dedh darjan kavita sangrah unke naam hai
 The shared rope of thought and sensation from which the agnostics often weaved their poetry is Nandkishore Acharya among the poets who have inherited it in its strongest form
 aksar yah samvednaa bahut dhime se unke yahaan ek darshanik aayam grahan karti nazar aati he
 For example: In one of his poems in the series' Kavita Suna Pani ', he writes -' a poem recited / water secretly sent the earth / suraj ne sun liya usko / ho gaya drishy uskaa / hawa bhi kahan kam thi / khushboo ho gai chhukar / lay ho gaya akaash / ga kar use / ek main hi nahin de paaya / use khud ko / nahin ho paaya Yourself 'ek anya dhang se sochen to unki kavitamruthal kii pyaas kii, uski aatma kii kavita he
 This poem also has the smell of mud or sand and the smell of memory
 lekin unamem koi smritijivi uchhaas nazar nahin aata, balki ek manthar or samvedansheel yatra dikhti he jisamen ret par pade paanvon ke nishaan dhudhane kaa dhiraj ho- or jo mit chuke hai, unako bhi pahchaanane kaa sabar ho
 There are many such poems here, which have to be read with sensation, and then travel from thought to philosophy
 kisi ek jagah ve kehete hai ki aisa koi sach nahin ho saktaa jo sapana bhi na ho
 Actually, it seems that originally this poet is a thinker
 nishchay hi unki vichaarak bhoomika bhi hindi main agar anyatam nahin to kai myanon main vishisht he
 Likewise, his playwright form is completely different and indistinguishable from his other forms
 unke kai naatak baar-baar khele or saraahe jate rahe hai
 It is also here that due to the personality of Acharya ji, his playwright form should not have been considered as freely as it should have
 ek sanstha ke rup main sahitya academy kii kirti pichley dinon kaaphi ksharit hui he
 In those days when the writers were under attack, the Akademi was expected to oppose them, but due to its wavering role in this case, many people also returned their awards
 yahi nahin, iske puraskaron par bhi dakshinpanthi rujhaanon kaa asar dikhataa rahaa
 This period is a period of great crisis in terms of literature and expression
 lekin sansthaaon ke patan kii jo kahani baaqi jagahon par satta-aropit lag rahi he, vah sahitya academy ke sandarbh main swa-aropit najar aa rahi he
 The vibrant role it should have seen as an autonomous and powerful organization of writers is not visible
 lekin phir bhi yah lekhakon kaa sanghathan he or isse ummid nahin chodi ja sakati
 It would be nice if the Sahitya Akademi stands with its writers and in this difficult time, if the right of shared resistance is not true then it should become a platform of shared conscience

 The ruthless murder of a high-profile elderly woman Pushpala in Lucknow tells a similar story
 maamle main police kaa pehla shaq ghar ke naukar par gaya
 This attack was conducted in the dark and when the distinction was revealed, the uniformed men of hearing also became conscious
 maamla pushtaini jameen kaa tha or is puri sajeesh ke centre main vyapaaree netaa chandra kumaar chhabda kaa naam aayaa

 Investigations then led to a money game behind the murder
 karodon kii sampati kii akeli malkin pushpalata chhabda pati kii maut ke baad ghar ke ek hisse main akele hi rahati thi
 Pushpala had no children and had given his entire property to his nephew Chandra Kumar Chhabra
 chandra kumaar chhaabaada peshey se vyapaaree he, jabaki ek baar meyar kaa chunaav bhi lard chukaa he
 Not only this, he is also said to be close to a Samajwadi Party leader
 dar, vasiyat or hatyapulice ke mutabik, chandra kumaar ko chachee pushpalata ke vasiyat badalane kaa dar sataane laga
 This is the reason why he conspired for the murder of Pushpala and included the servant Dipu in the scheme of murder
 chandra kumaar ne deepu ko hatya ke evaj main 50 hajaar rupee kaa laalach diya tha
 After Pushpalata's murder, the first suspicion to the police was on the servant Deepu
 kadai se poochtacha ke baad deepu ne puraa maamla khol kar rakh diya
 He said that Chandra Prakash had asked to kill the aunt in such a way that it would lead to normal death
 yojana ke tahat, deepu soti hui pushpalata ke munh ko takie se dabaanaa chaah rahaa tha, lekin tabhi pushpalata jag gai or sangharsh karne lagi
 Seeing the opportunity go by hand, Dipu rained one blow after the other on the flow and kept beating until his breath gave up

 dilli kii jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay (JNU) main yon utpeedan ke aaropee professor atul johari ke khilaaf ek peedit chaatra ne police ko jo bayaan diya he, vah behad sangeen hai
 The victim has accused Professor Atul Johri in her statement to the Delhi Police on Tuesday
 peedita ne saath hi atul johari par yah aarope bhi lagaae ki unki baat na maanane par professor ne uske research work ko roke rakhaa
 The victim also accused the department and high officials of not taking action on her complaints
 peedita ne kaha ki ab tak usne yah sochakar professor atul johari ke khilaaf police main shikaayat nahin kii ki kahin uskaa research work baadhit na ho jaae
 The victim student said that Professor Atul Johri's wife used to give instructions to his students to stay away from the professor

 Once he asked me if i had a boyfriend
 or agar meraa koi bwoyfriend he to kya meraa uske saath shaareerik sambandh bhi he
 Once he told me a joke that Shivji told Parvati that i want him (referring to the secret organ)
 vah is tarah ke joke sunaate rahete the or research work ke bare main discus karne ke liye apane offis bulaate rahete the
 The victim further said in her statement, "when i went to his office, instead of the chair, he used to make me sit next to him on the sofa and awkwardly rubbed my back and shoulders without my permission
" yah sab mere liye bahut hi asahaj karne vaala tha
 Once in 2014, when i went to the lab to talk to him about my synopsis, he made uncomfortable comments about my organs and said, "maintain your body, otherwise you will become ugly like other girls
" mere manaa karne kaa bhi un par koi asar nahin hua
 The victim told that when she told her fellow students about these antics of Professor Johri and when the professor came to know about this, he started behaving with maliciousness towards her
 peedita ne kaha, 'unhone mere liye padhai kaa maahaul dubhar kar diya or mere research work par dhyaan dena bhi band kar diya or mere saare asinaments rokkar rakhane lage
 After this i also tried to change my lab, but the department did not support me
 maine apane dean ko bataaya ki meraa yon shoshan kiya ja rahaa he or main apana suparvizer badalanaa chaahati hum
 But since i could not change my lab, i had to do research under the guidance of Professor Johri
 "peedita ne kaha, "maine janvari, 2017 main hi apana manuskript professor johari ko de diya tha, lekin ab tak unhone koi jawaab nahin diya he
 Any girl opposing their insidious antics would disrupt her research work, as she did to me
 main behad tanaav main or chintit hum, kyonki mujhe apana research july main jamaa karnaa he
 So far i have not complained to the police just because i was worried about completing my phd, but during this time i remained very uncomfortable
 "peedita ne police ko bataaya ki professor johari kii patni aksar lab aati rahati thim or hamen shaam 6
 She was advised not to stay in the lab after 0 pm
 lekin jab maine atul johari ke khilaaf anya chaatraon dwaara shikaayat kiye jane khabar suni to maine bhi shikaayat karne kaa faisla liya
 i request that strict action be taken against Professor Johri

 grih mantri amit shah (amit Shah) ne kaha ki jammu kashmir main aatankwaad kii jad bhi 370 (article 370) he
 He said that the people of Jammu and Kashmir want Jamhooriyat

 He said that we do not do politics of religion
 jammu kashmir main sirf muslim nahin rahete hai
 Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains all live in the valley
 unhone kaha ki dhara 370(article 370) acchhee he to sabake liye he or buree he to sabake liye buree he
 Amit Shah said that Section 370 has done great harm to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and the Valley

 He said that Article 370 was temporary and had to be removed at some time, but previous governments did not dare to remove it for vote bank

 After the removal of Articles 370 and 35A, Jammu and Kashmir is going to be an integral part of India

 If these companies go there then the people there will get employment
 badi companiyaan vahaan gayi to paryaton badhegaa
 But this is not possible because of 370
 370 ke kaaran jammu kashmir main desh kaa koi bada doctor nahin janaa chahta, kyonki vahaan wo apana ghar nahin kharid saktaa, vahaan kaa matadaata nahin ban saktaa or vahaan khud ko surakshit nahin mahasoos karata

 Former Australia captain and legendary batsman Ricky Ponting believes that Virat Kohli will get tough competition from his opponents in international cricket and whoever is mentally strong will have a better career
 betr lee ne haal me kaha tha ki philhal kohli sarvshereshth cricketer hai or unhone steve smith, jo root or ken williamson jaise khilaadiyon kii andekhi kii lekin lambey samay tak unke captain rahe ponting kaa maananaa he ki ‘sarvshereshth ballebaaj’ kii bahes ko khatm karne kaa samay ab bhi nahin aayaa he
 Ricky Ponting praised Indian batsman Virat Kohli and said that Virat has all the qualities to be the best player
 diggaj ballebaaj pontig ne bhartiya test team ke captain ko 'ati-pratibhashali' kaha
 The Australian captain, who won the World Cup twice to his team, said that Kohli and Australia captain Steven Smith are currently going through the same phase of their career
 unhone england ke jo root or newjiland ke captain ken wiliaimsan ko bhi in donon ballebaajon kii shrenee kaa bataaya
 However Ponting believes that mentally strong among all these players, his career will be better than the rest
 ponting ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, "viraat ke paas ekadivasiy kariyar main badhat hasil he
 We have all seen how he performed in the last Indian Premier League (IPL)
 vah ati-kushal or pratibhashali khilaadi hai lekin usase bhi mahatvapurn unke paas apane desh ke liye sarvshereshth banane or karne kii soch he
 Smith also has this ability
 " He said, "as long as Kohli and Smith are playing well, it doesn't matter to me who is better
 williamson evam root, yah sabhi khilaadi ek hi daur se guzar rahe hai
 Whoever is mentally strong will end the career with a better record
 " kohli ne ab tak kul 37 antarrashtriya shatak lagaae hai jabaki root, smith or williamson ne kramash: 18, 20, or 21 shatak lagaae hai
 Ponting, meanwhile, appeared to avoid comparing veteran batsman Sachin Tendulkar and Kohli
 unhone kaha ki kohli abhi kaaphi yuva hai
 He said, "let Virat end his career first
 vah sachin se tulana karne ke liye kaaphi yuva hai
 If they get hurt tomorrow there will be no comparison
 sachin ne 200 test match khele hai jabaki viraat ne abhi tak 60-70 test match hi khele hai
 " ponting ne saath hi kaha ki khel ke har praaroop main alag captain rakhane kaa faisla bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) or bharat ke simit overon kii team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni kaa apana faisla he
 He said, "my thoughts don't matter
 bisisiai or dhoni is bare main kya sochate hai, yah is par nirbhar karata he
 But at this time it does not seem that Dhoni does not want to captain the ODI and T20 team

 Now the question is, will England forget this big defeat and compete with Australia in the next Test? lords main england ke ballebaaz puri tarah se flop rahe
 England were able to score 312 runs in their first innings
 captain elister cook ne pich par tikne kii koshish zarur kii lekin unki pari bhi 96 ran se aage nahin bad saki
 The English captain has several challenges ahead of the third Test starting on 26 July
 ballebaazon ke form se lekar toss jeetne ke nuskhe talashna tak
 Regarding winning the toss, Alastair Cook said, 'I have lost the toss about 15 or 16 times, i am also surprised
 test main toss jeetna ahm ho jaataa he lekin iskaa ye matlab nahin ki main australian khilaadiyon ke achche pradarshan ko nazarandaaz kar rahaa hum
 The competition will be stronger in the next Test
 ' Australia bounced back after winning the first Test of the series with the biggest win in 67 years
 zaahir he isse team ke coach darren lehaman kaafii kush hai
 But he is also well aware of the strength of the English team to reverse
 australia ke coach darren lehaman bhi england kii taaqat ko maanate hai
 According to him, the English team is difficult to beat on home ground
 hamaari team jis josh ke saath lords main kheli usee josh ke saath agar aage bhi khelti he to nateeja sabake saamne hoga
 i think the England team will come back with full force
 tippaniyan After the defeat at Cardiff, the visiting team has overcome all its shortcomings but head injury to opener Chris Rodgers at Lord's remains a matter of concern

 In London, doctors checked Rodgers, whose medical report is due
 vaise australian coach ke saath-saath khilaadi bhi rogers kii team main vaapasi chaahate hai
 According to him, Rodgers has the most experience of playing English pitches
 aise main tisare test main unki vaapasi team ke liye kaafii mahatvapurn he
 Rodgers played well in both Tests to stop English bowlers at the start of the innings
 aise main australian captain or coach unke jaldi fit hone kii dua zarur maang rahe honge
 England batsmen flopped completely at Lord's
 england apni pehali pari main 312 ran bator saki
 Captain Alastair Cook tried to stay on the pitch but his innings could not progress beyond 96 runs
 26 july se shuru hone vaale tisare test se pehle english captain ke saamne kai chunautiyaan hai
 From batsman's form to finding tips on winning the toss
 toss jeetne ke bare main elister cook ne kaha, 'qareeb 15 yaa 16 baar main toss haar chukaa hum, iskaa mujhe bhi aashcharya he
 It is important to win the toss in the Test, but that does not mean that i am ignoring the good performance of the Australian players
 agle test main muqaabala zordaar hoga

 The comments cardiff main haar ke baad mehmaan team ne apni sabhi kamiyon se nijaat paa liya he lekin lords main openar kris rogers ko sir main lagi chot zarur fikr kii baat bani hui he
 According to the coach, Rodgers is fine but the decision on his playing will be taken by the team doctor
 landan main doctoron ne rogers kaa chekup kiya jisaki medical report aana baaqi he
 However, along with the Australian coach, the players also want to return to Rodgers' team

 aap bhi apane bacchon ko chidyaghar le jate honge
 Must have gone as a child himself
 jaanwaron ke aasapaas ghoomana or unhen vichrate hue dekhnaa vaaki acha lagata he
 But it feels good as long as we fully believe that in this variance we are safe as well as animals and birds

 chidyaghar ghoomane aae pili dress pahane ek baccha kaanch kii diwaar ke paar sher ko dekh rahaa tha
 As he turned, suddenly the lion sitting far away ran towards him and started hitting him with nails on the glass wall
 bachche or sher ke bich yadi vah kaanch kii diwaar na hoti to kya hota
 
 
 You can think sher bhi haalanki second bhar baad hi mud gaya
 Avoiding the lion's claws is not difficult, it would have been impossible if it had not been a glass wall in the middle
 yah video tokio ke chiba zoological park main banaaya gaya
 However, zoo officials say that the lion behaves in a similar way whenever it sees children
 unhen lagata he ki sher bacchon ke saath 'khilne kii manshaa' rakhata hoga
 The comments video main kuch palon kii yah ghatana dekhakar aap kaanp jaaenge
 
 
 a child in yellow dress who came to visit the zoo was looking at the lion across the glass wall
 vah jaise hi mudane laga ki achaanak dur baitha sher uski ore chalaang lagaate hue dauda or kaanch kii diwaar par nakhun-se maarane laga
 What would have happened if there had not been a glass wall between the child and the lion
 
 
 aap soch sakate hai
 However, the lion also turned around after a second
 sher ke panjon se bachanaa mushkil hi nahin, naammumkin ho saktaa tha agar bich main yah kaanch kii diwaar na hoti
 The video was made at the Chiba Zoological Park in Tokyo
 haalanki chidyaghar ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki vah sher jab bhi bacchon ko dekhtaa he aisi hi vyavhaar karata he
 He feels that the lion will have a 'play intention' with the children
 tippaniyan You will tremble after watching this incident of a few moments in the video

 Shattila Ekadashi is considered very special in Hinduism
 manyata he ki is ekadshi (ekadashi) kaa vrath or daan karne se sari manokamana purna hoti hai
 On the day of Shattila Ekadashi, special worship of Lord Vishnu is performed
 is ekadshi (ekadashi) main til kaa bhi behad khaas mahatv he

 The Brahmin said, "maharaj, why have you come?" i said- "I want alms
 " is par usne ek mitti kaa dhela mere bhikshapaatr main daal diya
 i returned to heaven with him
 kuch samay baad brahmani bhi sharir tyaag kar swarg main aa gai
 Donating clay to that Brahmin found a beautiful palace in heaven, but he found his house void of all things
 ghabara kar vah mere paas ai or kehane lagi, "bhagwan maine anek vrath aadi se aapaki puja kii, parantu phir bhi meraa ghar annadi sab vastuon se shunya he
 What is the reason for this?" is par maine kaha, "pehle tum apane ghar jaao
 Devastris will come to see you
 pehle unase shatatila ekadshi kaa punya or vidhi sun lo, tab dwaar kholana
 "she went to her house after hearing my words
 jab devstriyaan ain or dwaar kholane ko kaha to brahmani boli- "aap mujhe dekhne ai hai to shatatila ekadshi kaa mahatmaya mujhase kaho
 " unamem se ek devstri kehane lagi, "main kahati hum
 "when the Brahmin heard the greatness of Shattila Ekadashi, then the door opened
 devanganaon ne usko dekha ki na to vah gandharvi he or na asuri he varan pehle jaisi maanushi he
 According to his statement, the Brahmin fasted for Shatila
 iske prabhaav se vah sundar or rupavati ho gai tathaa uskaa ghar annadi samast samagriyon se yukt ho gaya
 Therefore, humans should abandon foolishness and fast on Shatila Ekadashi and donate Tiladi instead of greed

 When two secular parties fight among themselves, tell their motive to fight communalism, then understand that the election has come
 secularism bhartiya raajnneeti kaa vah buniyadi tatv he, jise siyaasi dalon ne footbal bana diya he
 Once used to form a front in the name of secularism, now the people who make it a front are fighting among themselves
 dikkat yah he ki secularism kaa chunavi jivan beemaa baantne vaale dal sirf muslim samaaj ke pratinadhiyon se hi kyon baat karte hai
 Why do they go to give assurance
 kya aapane kabhi aisi baithak dekhi he, jisamen bahusankhyak samaaj ke logon ko bulaayaa gaya ho or netaa kah rahe hon ki hamen bahusankhyak sampradayikta ko khatm karnaa he
 How can anyone give assurances to minorities without fighting majority communalism
 aap in tasveeron main kisi ek party ko mat dekhie
 Almost every party does this
 sampradayikta ke shikaar sikh bhi hai or isai bhi hai
 But neither one goes to get a certificate from him nor does he appear to give
 isiilie kaha ki agar yah buniyadi tatv na hota to saare dal dikhaave ke liye hi sahi isaki vakaalat na karte
 Meaning that it is necessary and it is also definitely that there is more rigging in its name, less fighting on the ground
 somvaar ko dilli main arvind kejariwal bhi muslim buddhijiviyon ke bich jate hai or kehete hai ki sampradayikta bhrashtachar se bhi bada khatra he
 It is said that if our family is over in the riots, then it all ends
 mangalvaar ko rajnath singh or arun jetali bhi dilli main hi muslim samaaj ke pratinidhiyon se milte hai
 The name of the conference is 'narendra Modi Mission 272 Plus Roll of Muslim Summit'
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh kehete hai ki kaleje par haath rakh kar jo bhi baaten hamane rakhi hai, jo bhi man main sawaal paidaa hon aap puch lenaa kabhi bhi jahaan gadabad hui, ham logon ke part par bhi agar koi gadabad yaa chook hui hogi, to main aapako yakeen dilaataa hum ki ham sheesh jhukaa kar kshamaa maang lenge
 By the way, you question yourself whether Sikh riots get justice through forgiveness or punishment
 kya gujarat, dilli, mujffarnagar dangon ke liye kisi netaa ke maafee maang lene se sampradayikta samaapt ho jaati he
 Is there a game of forgiving each other in the name of forgiveness? dangon main shaamil netaa kii tarah raajnneetik dalon ko bhi pratibandhit karne kaa khyaal kaisaa he
 Now let's go to Patna, where the fight for secularism is being fought through an unknown and automatic defection
 lalu yadav ne 24 ghante ke bheetar apane 13 main se 9 vidhayakon ko khoj nikaala or rickshaw par baithkar kehane lage ki nitish bijepi ke ishaare par sampradayikta ke khilaaf unki ladaai ko kamjor kar rahe hai
 Nitish says that he has separated from the NDA-BJP
 sampradayikta se kisi bhi tarah kaa samjhauta nahin kar sakate
 Chirag Paswan says that Father Ram Vilas Paswan has left a decision on me
 narendra modi ko clin chit mil chuki he
 Meanwhile, 11 parties gathered in Delhi today saying that they are non-congress and non-bjp
 jayalalita kii eidiemke, bijedy, sapa, jediu or agypi
 There is no seat agreement between them
 pradhanmantri kaa ummidavaar tay nahin he, magar chennai main jayalalita kii party unka janmdin kek rupi sansad ko kaat khaakar manaati he or pradhanmantri banane kaa prastaav paas karti he
 In this picture obtained from Twitter, Jayalalithaa has become the Prime Minister and all the heads of nations of the world are greeting her
 is poster main jayalalita ke kadamon main srilanka ke raashtrapati baithe hue hai
 Foreign policy is also final, just the front is yet to win
 udhar lakhanu main sapa kahati he ki mulaayam singh yadav ko pradhanmantri bananaa he
 The SP has not withdrawn support to the UPA, but came to the fore
 prakaash karaat ne kaha ki bijepi kii vibhaajankaree sampradayik nitiyon ke khilaaf ham ek jute hue hai
 There is no difference between the Congress and the BJP in terms of corruption and economic policies
 sharad yadav ne kaha he ki ham ek hai or yahi pehla morcha he
 Is it not good that in order to make this front credible, all these 11 parties would give a written affidavit that whatever the result came they would not leave this alliance
 kya bharosa jayalalita modi ke samarthan main nahin jaaengi yaa kya bharosa tisare morche ko fail idia bataane vaali bijepi inamen se kisi se ab samarthan nahin maangegi
 bjp's Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that some people gather like tattered clothes, stitch and repair it and then break after the election
 yahi third front he, fedral front he, new front he
 The country is bored with it
 vaise upie or endie bhi apane aap main morcha hi hai or inke bheetar bhi tut-foot hoti rahati he
 Even before and after the election
 sampradayikta se ladane kaa daawa karne vaali mamata mayawati kisi gathbandhan main nahin hai
 All secular groups are helping each other by fighting with each other with ideological support without stopping the splitting of votes
 janata kaise pahachaane ki asli yoddha koun he, sampradayikta ke khilaaf

 At the bjp's two-day national executive meeting held in Bhubaneswar on Saturday, the party's national president Amit Shah, while addressing the workers, said the party would also win a decisive victory in the upcoming assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne party adhyaksh ke bhaashan main kahi gayi baton se media ko ek press conference ke jariye avgat karaayaa
 He said that the party president said in his address that the myth of not defeating regional parties in these elections is broken
 upi main congress ke saath donon kshetreey dalon kii haar hui
 Winning 325 seats in 403 seats in UP is a testament to the fact that the people of UP have joined the BJP decisively
 yah nattejey jatvaad, tushtikaran or parivaarwaad kii raajnneeti kii asweekruti he
 He also said that 'narendra Modi is the most popular leader of the country since the independence of the country
 log unamem vishwaas karte hai'
 He said, 'we expected that the losers would sincerely accept their defeat, but now they are looking for an excuse to lose and in that excuse EVM has been discussed'
 unhone yah sawaal kiya ki 'saal 2004-09 main jab upie jiti to kya iviem thik thi? upi main sapa or basapa jiti or dilli main bhaajapa haari to kya iviem thik thi? is tarah kii baaten karnaa haar ko eemaandaaree se sweekaar karne kii bajaay chunaav ayeg ke khule niraadar ke samaan he'
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the party president called in the national executive meeting and said that today BJP is the largest party in the world, but there are still many areas in the country where BJP has to move forward
 isliye aalasy nahin karnaa he or varking cameti ke saare log 15 din kaa samay sanghathan ko denge
 
 
 Will go to booths and stay
 khud rashtriya adhyaksh bhi boothon par jaaenge
 Along with this, Amit Shah also announced that he will be touring the country for 95 days till next September and will meet the workers, talk to them and work towards strengthening the organization
 unhone kerala, tripura or bengal main bhaajapa or sangh kaaryakartaaon ke saath ho rahi hinsa kii ninda kii or kaha ki kerala main vampanthi sarkaar banane ke baad vahaan bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon par ho rahe hamale ke maddenjar tay kiya he ki agar hinsa hogi to ham shantipurna pratikaar karenge or vahaan bhaajapa kaa camel khilegaa
 The comments amit shah ne yah bhi kaha ki modi sarkaar ke teen varsh puure hone vaale hai
 The work done by the government during this period would have taken two to three terms for other governments to complete
 desh main puunji nivesh, kisaan vikaas, kaushal vikaas, takneekee vikaas, garibon ke utthan ke alaava anya kai vikaas kaaryakam hue hai
 We will proceed with the vision of New India
 iske saath hi unhone urisa ke vikaas kii sthiti ko chintajanak bataaya
 He called upon the activists to say that the BJP reached its climax after the 2014 victory, but the BJP is yet to reach its climax
 aaj hamaare 13 mukhyamantri hai, lekin hamaari kalpana he ki desh ke har rajya main hamaare mukhyamantri hon
 In 2019, we have to make Narendra Modi the Prime Minister of the country again
 panchayat se lekar parliament tak har str par bhaajapa kaa shashan hona chahie
 Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad made the media aware of what was said in the speech of the party president through a press conference
 unhone bataaya ki party adhyaksh ne apane sambodhan main kaha ki in chunaavon main kshetreey dalon ko na haraa paane kaa myth tutaa he
 Both regional parties lost together with the Congress in UP
 upi main 403 main 325 seat kaa jeetna is baat kaa pramanik udhaaharan he ki upi kii janata nirnaayak rup se bhaajapa ke saath ai he
 This result is a rejection of the politics of casteism, appeasement and familism
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki 'desh kii aazaadee ke baad se narendra modi desh ke sabase lokapriy netaa hai
 People believe in them '
 unhone kaha ki, 'ham yah apeksha karte the ki haare hue dal eemaandaaree se apni haar ko sweekaar karenge, lekin ab wo haarane kaa bahaanaa dhund rahe hai or us bahaane main iviem kii charchaa hui he'
 He asked the question: "when the UPA won in 2004-09, was the EVM good?" SP and BSP won in UP and BJP lost in Delhi, was EVM right? This kind of talking is like open humiliation of the election, instead of accepting defeat honestly
 ravishankar prasad ne bataaya ki party adhyaksh ne rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main aahvaan karte hue kaha ki aaj bhaajapa duniya kii sabase badi party he, lekin ab bhi desh main bahut saare kshetra hai, jahaan bhaajapa ko aage badhanaa he
 So do not be lazy and all the people of the working committee will give 15 days time to the organization
 
 
 boothon par jaaenge or rahenge
 The National President himself will also visit the booths
 iske saath hi amit shah ne yah bhi ghoshnaa kii ki wo aagaamee sitambar tak 95 din tak deshbhar main daura karenge or kaaryakartaaon se milakar, unase baat kar sanghathan ko majboot banane kii disha main kaam karenge
 He condemned the violence with BJP and Sangh workers in Kerala, Tripura and Bengal and said that after the formation of the Left government in Kerala, in view of the attack on BJP workers there, we have decided that if there is violence, we will make peaceful retaliation And the BJP lotus will blossom there
 tippaniyan Amit Shah also said that three years of Modi government are nearing completion
 is dauraan sarkaar ne jo kaam kiya anya sarkaron ko ye kaam puraa karne main do-teen kaarykaal lagate
 Apart from capital investment, farmer development, skill development, technological development, upliftment of the poor, many other development programs have been done in the country
 ham new india kii kalpana ke saath aage badhenge
 Along with this, he described the development of Orissa as a matter of concern
 unhone kaaryakartaaon se aahvaan kiya ki yah kaha gaya ki saal 2014 kii jeet ke baad bhaajapa apane charmotkarsh par pahunch gai, lekin bhaajapa kaa charmotkarsh aana abhi baaki he
 Today we have 13 Chief Ministers, but we imagine that we should have Chief Ministers in every state of the country
 2019 main hamen dobaaraa narendra modi ko desh kaa pradhanmantri bananaa he
 There should be BJP rule at every level from panchayat to parliament
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki 'desh kii aazaadee ke baad se narendra modi desh ke sabase lokapriy netaa hai
 People believe in them '
 unhone kaha ki, 'ham yah apeksha karte the ki haare hue dal eemaandaaree se apni haar ko sweekaar karenge, lekin ab wo haarane kaa bahaanaa dhund rahe hai or us bahaane main iviem kii charchaa hui he'

 The comments amit shah ne yah bhi kaha ki modi sarkaar ke teen varsh puure hone vaale hai
 The work done by the government during this period would have taken two to three terms for other governments to complete

 In 2019, we have to make Narendra Modi the Prime Minister of the country again
 panchayat se lekar parliament tak har str par bhaajapa kaa shashan hona chahie

 During the huge road show of BJP president Amit Shah, there was a fierce clash between the party and Trinamool Congress (TMC) supporters on the streets of Kolkata
 haalanki shah ko kisi tarah kii chot nahin ai or police unhen surakshit sthaan tak le gai
 The TMC tweeted that the Trinamool parliamentary team comprising Derek o'brien, Sukhendu Shekhar Rai, Manish Gupta, Nadeemul Haq wants to meet the Election Commission regarding the attack on Bengal's property after Shah's roadshow in Kolkata
 bhaajapa ke bahari gundon ne aagjanee kii or vidyasagar kii aavaksh pratimaa ko tod diya
 It is worth noting that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had on Tuesday said a fierce attack on BJP President Amit Shah that what is God who cannot perform any demonstration against him
 banerjee ne kolkata main shah ke road sho ke dauraan bhaajapa or trinmul congress ke samarthakon ke bich jhadpon ke baad yah baat kahi thi
 During this time, BJP workers have been accused of vandalizing the Ishwarchand Vidyasagar College and breaking the statue of 19th century social reformer Vidyasagar
 mamata banerjee ne uttar kolkata sthit vidyasagar college kaa daura karne ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki amit shah khud ko kya samajhate hai? kya vah sabase upar hai? kya vah bhagwaan hai jo unke khilaaf koi pradarshan nahin kar saktaa?bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha, 'tiemasi ke gundon ne mujhapar hamalaa karne kii koshish kii
 Mamta Banerjee (chief Minister of West Bengal) tried to incite violence, but i am safe
 ' shah ne kaha ki jhadap ke dauraan police mookadarshak bani rahi
 He said that the police had told him that the permission for the roadshow ends with the college and that he would be taken to the ancestral house of the Bidhan Sarani of Swami Vivekananda
 shah ne daawa kiya, 've (police) niojit maarg se hat gaye or us raste par le gaye jahaan trephic jam tha
 i was not allowed to go to Vivekananda's residence to pay tribute and i am saddened by it
 udhar, mamata banerjee ne is par pratikriya dete hue shah ko 'gunda' bataaya
 He said at the rally in Behala of the city, 'if you take your hand to Vidyasagar, what will i tell you besides the goons
 ' unhone kaha, 'mujhe aapaki vichaardhaara se ghrinaa he, mujhe aapke tareekon se nafrat he
 He also announced a protest rally on Thursday against the demolition of Vidyasagar's bust
 mamata ne kaha ki kya amit shah bhagwaan se upar hai ki unke khilaaf koi pradarshan nahin kar saktaa
 Meanwhile, the BJP on Tuesday requested the Election Commission to stop West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee from campaigning in the state, alleging that the 'constitutional system' has collapsed there
 kolkata main bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ke road sho ke dauraan hinsa or aagjanee kii ghatana ke baad kendriya mantri nirmala sitaraman or mukhtaar abbaas nakvi sahit party kaa ek pratinidhimandal chunaav ayog pahunchaa or rajya main swatantra evam nishpaksh chunaav sunishchit karne ke liye tatkaal hastkshep karne kii maang kii
 Naqvi accused Mamata Banerjee of being a 'participant' in the violence for allegedly targeting the BJP and claimed that she 'incited' her Trinamool Congress workers to attack the BJP workers
 isse pehle yah tanaav tab bad gaya tha jab amit shah ke kafile ke college street or swami vivekanand ke nivas ke liye uttari kolkata main bidhan sarini se guzarate vakt patharav kiya gaya
 The clashes started outside the Calcutta University campus on College Street when a group started shouting slogans against Shah, officials said
 (input bhashaa se) The Congress is trying hard to mobilize the entire opposition against the bjp-led NDA government in the Budget Session of Parliament
 vahiin trinmul congress (tiemasi) supremeo mamata banerjee ne vipaksh kii ore se aisi koshishon ko ‘routine kavayad’ bataate hue zyaada garmjoshi nahin dikhaai he
 Please tell that Sonia Gandhi has given a call for a meeting of opposition parties on the budget day on Thursday
 rajya vidhansabha main patrakaron se baat karte hue mamata banerjee nevipakshi dalonki sambhavit baithak ko lekar kaha, ‘mujhe isaki jaankaree nahin he
 Our party's parliamentary committee will see it
 main vahaan nahin ja rahi kyonki mere pehle se hi kai kaarykram tay he
 Every day they sit together, it should not be taken too seriously, it is a routine matter
 ’tiemasi sutron ke mutabik saansad derek o bryan or sudeep bandopadyay party kii numaaindgi karenge
 This stance of the party has come amid such speculation that TMC has been trying to distance itself from the Congress since Rahul Gandhi became the Congress President
 tiemasi vakt-vakt par ye jataati rahi he ki kaise pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chunauti dene ke liye vipaksh kii kaman sanbhaalane ko sabase behatar sthiti main hai
 Mamta Banerjee also criticized the Congress in a single breath with BJP over election funding in the TMC Core Committee meeting on Wednesday
 mamata ne kaha, ‘bijepi digital (soshal media) par karodon kharch kar rahi he
 Congress is also doing the same thing
 yaad rakhie ki donon partiyon ke paas khub paisa he
 In this case, BJP is number one and Congress is second
 kuch dal beshak satta main nahin hai lekin unhone istemaal ke liye bahut sa fund juta rakhaa he
 This is not the case with parties like ours
 ’kolkata main pichley maheene yojit india today conklev main modi ke netritv vaale endie ko chunauti dene ke liye vipaksh main ‘samuhik netritv’ kii aavashyaktaa par jor diya tha
 Mamta Banerjee's dream of creating a 'federal Front' is undoubtedly incomplete but she clearly does not want to let the Congress lead the opportunity to lead the opposition
 jab mamata banerjee se vipaksh kaa mahagathbandhan banane kii sambhaavna par sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha, ‘ham sansad main milakar kaam kar rahe hai
 i met Lalu Prasad in Patna, i have good relations with Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh
 tamilnadu main stallin or odisha main naveen patnayak se bhi ham sampark main hai
 Uddhav also came to meet me in Maharashtra
 or bhi kai logon ke saath achche sambandh hai
 Even in BJP i have good relations with some people but not all
 ’rahul gandhi kii congress adhyaksh pad ke liye haal main hui pronnati par mamata banerjee ne koi pratikriya nahin di
 He just said that Rahul is young and he needs experience
 ye tay he ki 2019 chunaav se pehle vipakshi morcha khadaa karne ke mudde par tiemasi bahut phoonk phoonk kar kadam rakh rahi he
 The TMC was present at the 'rashtriya Manch' meeting of BJP rebel leader Yashwant Sinha but it was better to stay away from the meeting convened by NCP leader Sharad Pawar
 garmi kii chhuttiyon ke baad nyaaypalika yanisupreme courtor sarkaar ke bich rishte saamaanya hoge
 Because now the collegium would have changed, after Justice Chelameswar retired, the number five judge Arjan Kumar Sikri has now entered the collegium in the seniority order of judges in the Supreme Court
 aise main sarkaar ke saath jajon kii niyuktiyon ko lekar chal rahitnatanivale rishton main thodi sahajata kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 Justice Chelameswar Collegium, one of the biggest advocates for Uttarakhand High Court Chief Justice KM Joseph to be brought to the Supreme Court
 haalanki 43 dinon kii garmi chhuttiyon ke baad 2 july se supreme court khul rahi he, anumaan he ki ab maahaul badla-badla rahegaa
 The judges will change in the benches, the issues of coordination with the government may also change
 haalanki justise ke em joseph ko supreme court main laae jane kaa mudda bane rahane ke asaar hai
 The matter may also get bogged down by the decision of the government to return the recommendation of the collegium in the name of Mohammad Mansoor and Basharat Ali Khan, two senior lawyers for the Allahabad High Court 
 in do senior vakeelon main mohammad mansoor supreme court ke hi purv jaj justise sagir ahamed ke bete bhi hai
 The collegium of three judges of the Supreme Court for the appointment of judges in the High Courts had recommended both these names for the Allahabad High Court in 2016, but the central government held these files in May with these comments after holding these files for two years
 These files were sent to the Collegium for reconsideration that there are many complaints against them
 lihaaja is najariye se bhi vichaar kiya jaae
 The old officials of the Supreme Court say that the government may have gone through an exasperation that Justice Sagir Ahmed had recommended the autonomy of Kashmir in his report
 dhara 370 ke bhi himachati unke bete ko itani aasaani se elahabaad hoicourt kaa jaj banane ko hari jhandi kaise di jaae
 However, Mohammad Mansoor has been defending the decisions and policies of the Yogi government in the High Court as the Chief Standing Council
 ab collegium kaa mood in donon garam rahe muddon par kaisaa rahata he ye dekhne vaali baat hogi, kyonki ab hoicorts main jajon kii niyukti ke liye teen varishthatam jajo ke collegium main chif justise deepak mishra, justise ranjan gogoi or justise madan bi lokur in muddon par kisi raay rakhte hai
 It is also worth noting that two of them have also been in the rebel party holding press conferences
 ye teen jaj supreme court main jajon ke aliveshan ke liye bane collegium kaa bhi hissaa hai
 Just after these three, Justice Kurian Joseph and Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri will also join it
 justise joseph bhi bhi press conference vaale gut main rahe hai
 Therefore, in the collegium of five judges for the Supreme Court, there will be three judges
 aise main dilachasp ye dekhnaa hoga ki aakhir justise gogoi kaa ravaiya kaisaa rahata he, kyonki kaayade se unako 2 aktubar se mukhya nyaayadhish bananaa he
 The Chief Justice sends the recommendation of the name of his successor to the Central Government about one month before his retirement
 aise main unke baagi tevar or chif justise ke saath unke rishton kaa taasir barkaraar rahati he yaa phir chhuttiyon ke baad nai taazgi aati he
 That remains to be seen

 berogari kii baat kehane waalon ke paas aankade nahin he, vah bahaane dhund rahe hai

 sarkaar ke saamne rojgaar ke aankadon ko dene kii chunauti he, jis par kaam jari he

 History is witness whenever a cricket series is played between these two countries, more verbal warfare is performed than sports

 The same thing happened in Kolkata ODI when the players are clashing with each other on the field keeping the spirit of the game
 darasal, team india kolkata vanade main toss jitkar pehle ballebaaj kar rahi thi
 India's 3 wickets fell and at the crease were Virat Kohli and Kedar Jadhav

 On the third day, India presented its case in the second round of cross-examination in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case, an Indian citizen jailed in Pakistan in espionage case
 bharat kaa paksh rakhte hue varisht vakil harish salve ne court ke patal pakistan ko benakaab kiya
 Salve said that the hearing in Jadhav's case in Pakistan was completed for 4-6 months
 lekin mumbai hamale main maare gaye 150 logon ke maamle main kya hua? pulavama hamale kaa zikr karte hue salve ne kaha ki khud ko antarrashtriya str par jaanch se bachaane ke liye pakistan ne kulbhushan jadhav mohare ke taur par istemaal kiya
 Harish Salve, appearing for India in the second round of arguments, said that this court does not require the help of experts to decide whether military courts in Pakistan are in line with the process
 international kamishan of jurists or europea sansad ne pakistan kii sainya adaalaton kii aalochana kii he
 Salve said three unsuccessful attempts by Pakistan to derail the court's action
 salve ne kaha ki pakistan kii adaalaton dwaara nyaayik samiksha ke daayre simit hai, unhone kai baar sainya adaalat ke faisle main hastkshep nahin kiya he
 In the Kasab case, the Supreme Court of India admitted that since it was a death sentence case, they examined the records
 samiksha ise kehete hai
 Harish Salve said that Pakistan attempted to release the video of Jadhav's alleged confession on February 18 before the oral hearing but the court refused to take the video on record
 unhone kaha ki pakistan ne aise sakshya prastut karne kaa prayaas kiya jise maukhik prastutiyon ke madhyam se asweekaar kar diya gaya
 Salve said that Jadhav's bio-data shows that he is a former Indian Navy officer
 yah unki bhartiya naagarikta kaa pramaan he
 Indian citizens are not the kind whose nationality needs to be denied
 salve ne kaha ki bharat or pakistan ke bich saal 2008 kaa dwipaksheeya samjhauta vienna sandhi ke anuchhed 36 dwaara die gaye adhikaron ko nahin chin saktaa
 He said that Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Counselor Relations applies since Jadhav's arrest
 pakistan ne avena cese par bharosa kiya jo unke khilaaf jaataa he
 According to the case, once it is found out that a captive is a foreign national, counselor access should be granted
 salve ne ek varisht kanoonvid dwaara kahe shabdon kaa zikr karte hue kaha, jab aap kanoon main majboot hote hai to kanoon par hathaudaa maarthe hai, jab aap tathyon par majboot hote hai to tathyon par hathaudaa maarthe hai or jab aap inamen se kisi par bhi majboot nahin hote to teble par hathaudaa maarthe he
 Due to no case, Pakistan has struck a hammer on the proverbial table
 pakistan kii taraf se bharat ke bare main 'besharm' or 'ghamandi' jaise shabdon kaa kai baar istemaal kiya gaya
 India lodges a strong objection to this insult before the International Court of Justice

 Nitish blamed the Congress for the backwardness of the state
 unhone kaha, ‘congress ne 63 vashren tak bihar kii upeksha kii or yahaan ke logon ke saath nyaay nahin kiya
 On the other hand Lalu alleged that the Congress is contesting all the 243 seats so that the NDA takes the electoral advantage
 unhone kaha, ‘yah sakasham party nahin he lekin sirf adnga laga rahi he
 'the good thing for the Congress is that in the last Lok Sabha elections its vote percentage increased to 13 percent whereas in the 2005 assembly elections it was just five percent
 pichley varsh 18 vidhansabha upachunaavon main iskaa vot pratishat badhkar 15 fisadi tak pahunch gaya
