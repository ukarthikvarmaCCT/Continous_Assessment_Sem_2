 China chose the coastal city of Qingdao for colonial-era buildings and beautiful gardens for the June 9 Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit because it is the main stop of Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)

 It was complicated for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to establish a diplomatic balance here as he had to keep India's view on the BRI, while also registering India's disagreement on the BRI
 pradhanmantri isamen safal bhi dikhe
 Modi was invited to present India's vision immediately after SCO host Xi's opening speech
 apane bhaashan main modi ne avaagaman or sampark badhaane ke liye bharat kaa drushtikon rakhaa lekin vah china se bilkul alag tha
 In Xi's presence, Modi said, "improving traffic and connectivity with scos and neighbors is one of India's priorities
 '' lekin unhone saaf kar diya ki bharat ''sampark sudhaarney kii aisi nai pariyojnaon kaa swaagat karegaa jo samaveshi, tikaoo, paardarshee hon or jinamein rashtron kii samprabhutaa or kshetreey akhandta kaa bharpoor sammaan jhalkata ho

 a paragraph focusing on the BRI states the consent of six SCO members — Russia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan — to replace all SCO 'member countries'
 haalanki is dastavej main anya sabhi jagahon par essio 'sadsy desh' shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 India thus made its position on the China-led BRI project clear that it was not in favor of it
 vahiin, china ghoshnaptr main biarai kaa zikr karaane main safal rahaa jise ek adhikari vyaavhaarik samjhauta qaraar dete hai
 Ashok Kanth, former Ambassador of India to China and director of the Institute for Chinese Studies, Delhi, says, "we expressed great support towards regional connectivity
" '' kanth kehete hai ki ab aisa samajha jane laga he ki bharat or china ek duusare ke liye pehle kii tarah ghor matbhed kii jagah ek duusare ke liye sahmati ke bhav se bhare dikhte hai

 He said that Wuhan has opened the doors to 'a new beginning'
 bharat-china sambandhon main jitna utaar-chadhaav rahaa he usamen beshak kai baar aisa nayaa aagaaj ho chukaa he
 Will this new beginning of Modi and Xi not have the same old consequences? *** bhartiya mul kii canada kii porn star or'jism-2'se bollywood ke daravaaje par dastak de chukisni leonka kathith taur par rape ko 'sarprise sex' kehane vaala bayaan ab kanoonee shakl le chukaa he

 Although thousands of supporters were waiting to get a glimpse of Thailand's first female Prime Minister Yingluck on Friday, she did not appear
 iske baad ashankaayen jataai jane lageen ki kahin vah aatm nirvaasan main rah rahe apane arbapati bhai thaxin ke paas to nahin chali gai hai
 Chief Justice Chip Chulamon set September 27 as the next date of hearing in the case and feared that she might leave the country
 unhone kaha, unke adhivaktaa ne bataaya he ki vah biimaar he or faisle main unhone deree karne ke liye kaha hai
 However, the court is not sure that he is ill and gave a decision to issue a warrant against him
 ullekhneey he ki 2014 main sainya takhtapalat ke jariye yinglak kii sarkaar ko hataa diya gaya tha
 If he is convicted in a case of negligence in the rice subsidy policy, he can be banned from life for 10 years in prison and politics

 When asked by the reporter's lawyer whether Yingluck is in Thailand, he said in the mind that i do not know
 bataa den ki yinglak ke bhai thaxin shinawatra bhi thailand ke purv pradhanmantri he joki bhrashtachar ke doshi tehraye jane or do saal ke karawas kii sajaa sunaaye jane ke baad vah varsh 2008 main desh chhodkar chale gaye the

 ye wo maheenaa tha jab uttarakhand ek aisi aapadaa kaa saamana karne vaala tha, jiskaa use haragij andaja na tha
 The name of this disaster was 'kedarnath tragedy'
 is traasadee main hajaaron log kaal ke gaal main samaa gaye
 Even today hundreds of people are missing
 darasal har saal barsaat kaa mausam aate hi uttarakhand saham sa jaataa he
 In this season, cloudburst and flooding are very common in mountainous areas
 uttarakhand kii khubasurat vaadiyaan sadiyon se is samasya se jujh rahi hai
 This year too, many areas adjoining the valley including Pithoragarh, Dharchula, Almora were badly engulfed by floods
 sthiti saamaanya hone kii raah takate hue logon ke maathe par bal padhane lage
 Still Uttarakhand has not been completely saved from the rainy conditions
 samooche uttar bharat main baari barish ke kaaran himachal pradesh or uttarakhand main baadh or bhuskhalan kii sthiti paidaa ho gai
 Other states affected by this are Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh
 baadh ke kaaran jaan-maal kaa baari nuksaan hua or bahut se log baadh main bah gaye or hajaaron log beghar ho gaye
 Many people were hit by this disaster
 mangalvaar ko bhi pithauragarh ke baram kshetra main badal fat gaya
 Heavy damage is expected due to cloudburst
 badal fatne se ek motor pul bah gaya he
 The teams of SDRF and NDRF have reached the spot
 baari barish or bhuskhalan kii bhi khabar he
 Due to rains on the mountains, Kashipur was flooded due to release of water from the Dhel Barrage of Ramnagar
 pani ke adhik bahaav ke kaaran ilaake kii kai bastiyaan jalmagn ho gayi or kheton main khadi fasalon ko nuksaan pahunchaa
 The river flooded with 35 thousand cusecs of water released on Tuesday night from the Dhela barrage at Maldhanchod in Ramnagar
 yahaan nadiyaan khatre ke nishaan se upar bah rahi hai, jo sthaneey logon ke liye chintaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 During this time, the administration has instructed people to avoid traveling etc
 philhal uttarakhand sarkaar puri mustaidi se is aapadaa se nipatane kii baat kah rahi he
 Significantly, every year the administration makes a lot of claims to deal with the floods, but the reality of those claims is seen flowing in the drains of the disaster
 fifa kii ek adaalat ne somvaar ko cep blator or maaikel platini par 8 saal kaa bain laga diya
 The court said that both of them have misused their position
 ye bain platini ko 20 lakh swiss franks (kareeb 13
 31 crore) has been imposed in the case of payment
 blator or platini par footbal se judi sabhi gatividhiyon par turant prabhaav se bain laga diya gaya he
 Both were fined
 Blatter, who was in command of FIFA since 1998, was fined 50,000 Swiss francs and Uefa suspended chief and FIFA vice-president Platini was fined 8 xxrep 4 0 francs
 adaalat kii taraf se jari bayaan main kaha gaya he ki donon ne apane-apane padon kaa durupyog kiya he
 Then the matter came in the headlines, this decision against two of the most powerful people of world football, the gorakhandha running in this most popular sport of the world, again came into the headlines
 fifa 2011 main platini ko blator dwaara adhikrut20 lakh swiss franks ke bhugtanaki jaanch kar rahaa tha
 He said that he was given as a consultant in lieu of his work from 1999 to 2002
 hiton ke takaraav kaa maamlafifa kii adaalat ne donon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope ko khaarij kar diya lekin unhen hiton ke takaraav kaa doshi paaya
 The court said, "neither in the written statement nor during the hearing could Blatter give any statutory basis for this payment
 'adaalat ne kaha ki platini vishwasaneeyata or naitikta ke saath kaam karne main naakaam rahe or apane kartavya kiahmiyat ko lekarlaparvaah rahe
 In his New Year message, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while reflecting on the 'shortcomings and mistakes' of his government and the Congress, perhaps going through a difficult phase, today talked of "a new beginning" of 'corrective work'
 singh ne aane vaale varsh 2014 main sabhi ke liye shanti, suraksha, prasannataa or samruddhi kii kaamana karte hue kaha, yah samay ummid banaae rakhane, lakshyon ko praapt karne, sankalp or vishwaas ke saath nai shuruyaat karne kaa he
 In his message, he said, as a nation, it is time to unite and prepare ourselves for future opportunities and challenges
 unke is sandesh ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon kii chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke pariprekshya main dekha ja rahaa he
 The Prime Minister said, the new year is a time for each of us to reflect on the successes and achievements of the past year as well as the shortcomings and mistakes
 yah hamen swayan kaa punarmoolyankan karne or bhavi varsh ke liye yojana banane, sudharatmak kaary karne tathaa nae lakshya tay karne kaa avasar pradaan karata he
 In the passing year, this message of Singh is considered important in the context of the difficult times of the Congress and the government
 bhrashtachar ke kai arapon, manhagaai or arthvyavastha ke dhime padane aadi muddon par sarkaar ko in dinon badi aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 In the recent state assembly elections held in five states, the Congress has suffered heavy defeats in four states
 shanivaar kii subah aasmaan nilabh hua or phir achaanak andhera chaa gaya
 At the point of sea and sky, there was a void in which many clouds filled with drowned water
 subah saadhe saat baje chennai ke apollo aspataal main nilabh mishra ne antim saans lee or yatra par chal die
 It was the nature of Neelabh to remain silent
 wo kinare jaise shor karte hue kabhi nahin the
 The atals were as calm as the ocean and perhaps that is why the sea attracted them a lot
 jab farvari kii shuruyaat main pataa laga ki nilabh chennai ja rahe hai, tabhi se ek shankaa man main ghar kar gai thi
 The straw got from the straw, the tin is near the tin
 phir jab is vidaa se pehle unhen dekhne gaya to saaf ho gaya ki chamatkaar hi unhen waapas laa saktaa he
 But Neelabh won by miracle
 nilabh ko itani jaldi janaa to nahin tha
 We all believe the same
 lekin nilabh jitna jie, puraa jie
 Full of life
 unhen yaad karte lagata he ki jane se zyaada ahm he jeena or jeena kise kehete hai, yah nilabh kaa jivan sahaj sikhaata he
 Devoid of treachery, free from pomp and corruption, humanism, living faith in brotherhood, frantically questioning and fighting for public advocacy, playing the inner journalist well, making love and respect a way of life Live blue kam bolnaa, zyaada sunanaa, bolte samay bhashaa or sahajata kaa sadaa dhyaan rakhana, aavesh se dur shanti detii awaz se logon se mukhaatib hona nilabh kii pahchaan thi
 Neelabh first met in Jaipur
 jan-sanghathanon ke pradarshnon kii bheed main nilabh kisi kone main ek chatak kii tarah sabakuch apni ankhon se dekhte mil jate the
 Having them then filled the young young journalists like us with energy
 har mulaakaat kuch sikhaakar jaati thi
 Every time a new approach, a new aspect, some new words and styles were found
 dhire-dhire bolne vaala ek baari sa sharir laden hue aam ke gachh kii tarah mahasoos hota tha jiske paas chhaanv bhi thi or fal bhi
 Then he came to Delhi
 yahaan unhone outluk hindi main kaam karnaa prarambh kiya
 He lived first in Anandlok and then in Shahpur Jat
 yaheen main bhi arvind kejariwal se apane mohabhang ke baad mukhyadhara kii patrakarita main lautne ke nirnay ke saath unke paas aakar rahane laga
 i never asked for a job from Neelabh, nor did he ever
 yah shaayad ham donon ke bich kaa aghoshit samjhauta tha
 Between working with them and working for them, we continued to take responsibility for our institutions
 nilabh or mujhe lekar kai baar yah bhi prachaar kiya gaya ki yah to nilabh kaa chota bhai he
 Of course, we were homebound
 donon kaa ghar ganga
 i was born on the banks of the Ganges and that too
 to kya ki meri ganga avadh main thi or unki magadh main
 It was Ganga only
 kitne hi varshon tak nilabh mujhe yah bataakar hansate rahete the ki amuk vyakti kah rahaa tha ki main tumhaara bhai hum
 i used to say proudly, what he is telling lies
 jab nilabh ke dah ke liye chennai pahunchaa to apane saath shishi main aab-e-jamajam or gangaajal bhi milakar le gaya
 Introduced him to the Ganga of his right before Nilabh's right
 baaki kuch asthiyaan saath le aayaa hum
 At Garhmukteshwar, eating pumpkin-bread at his and my favorite shop on the banks of the Ganges will leave him to play in the lap of the Ganges
 ham donon kii atmiyata ke jo sopan the, ve hai bhojan, hindi bhashaa, patrakarita, sangeet, sahitya, kala-samskruti, cinema or jan-sarokaar
 Food is written first
 kyonki sabase ahm bhi yahi tha
 Both insisted on the food being tasteful and elegant
 donon bhojan par ghanton baat kar sakate the, kabhi bhi kha sakate the or kisi bhi prakaar ke bhojan par adhikaar purvak kuch na kuch bataa sakate the
 From the social background and politics of food, we would pay special attention to its type, tendency and cooking
 annapurna se misty doi wo laate the, ghar par jagannathi dalma main pakaata tha
 Bhat used to go his rounds with Raita and Kalounji
 shanivaar se ek hi baat khaae ja rahi he
 For three weeks, a lover of food, taking various medicines, became a body full of chemicals
 
 
 kaash nilabh jane se pehle ek baar uth jate or main unki pasand kaa sabakuch banaakar unhen khilaa paata
 Never seen Nilabh angry
 unhen koi jaldi nahin thi
 Neither impatience, nor acuteness
 sagar jaise shant
 Eyes filled with childlike agility, hands always feeling paternity
 sanidhya aisa ki koi chintaa karne kii aavashyaktaa na rah jaae
 After hours of listening to the anger of our people, it was their easy behavior to gently mumble
 in sabake bich jo ek baat adig thi wo tha kaam
 Work timely and correctly
 khabar ko kaise dekhen, kaise kholen, kaise likhen se lekar khabar kii bhashaa, prabhaav or gathan par wo dronacharya se bhi kathor the
 The translation was written as if it were written in Hindi, later it must have been done in English
 or vyakti se zyaada khabar kii shreshthata
 Today, there is no hesitation in saying that while working in so many institutions, he kept writing for them and he kept printing them with different names
 nilabh ne ek baat baar-baar sikhaai
 News priority use roko mat or na kisi ko rokane do
 Stop then fight
 nahin chap sakati to dusron ko do
 According to him, the name was Gaur
 wo kehete the ki yah to zimmedaari tay karne ke liye hota he
 The rest is news
 wo chapani chahie
 My place is not right for you, otherwise
 nilabh un birle logon main the jo apni raajnneeti or chetana kaa istemaal khabar ko khangaalane ke liye karte the
 Not to impress and change it
 wo khud ko anasakt rakhkar karm main lagane vaale logon main the
 Neelabh is the person who first introduced me to Mozart and Beethoven
 kumaar gandharva or subbalakshmi ham donon ko priy the
 Mango in fruits, sugarcane in juices, sugary food and tea in drinks were beloved by Nilabh bahut kam log jaanate hai ki thandai bhi unka priy peya tha or isliye ham log avasar milane par thandai jamaa lete the
 This sweetness remained in his personality throughout his life
 unke shatru bhi unase yah shikaayat nahin kar sakate the ki unhone kisi ko thes pahunchaai ho
 He fought with facts but his face and language were full of spontaneity and a smile, free from reactionaryism
 sabase vilakshan baat jo unke vyaktitv main rahi, wo yah thi ki unke paas kisi bhi vishay ke liye samagrata thi
 Interpretation of subjects on the basis of regionality, evaluation of them according to their history, expansion of the subject on the basis of their images in literature and music, and their ability to open up the subject in a timely manner combined to form a holistic idea that was Neelabh
 Apart from that, it is not seen in other people
 aspataal or isiu nilabh ko katai pasand nahin the
 Hospitals used to go very hard
 chennai main bhi wo lagaataar ladate rahe ki unhen isiu main na rakhaa jaae
 When Kavita met Srivastava on Saturday morning, he came out of his mouth, sorry Anand, we could not save Neelabh
 maine samajhaayaa, aisa nahin he
 Neelabh did not like ICU
 wo usase baahar nikal aae
 Actually, what was his strength in the ease of Neelabh was his stubbornness
 jo pasand he wo pasand he
 What he wants and what he does not like, he cannot remain a part of them
 wo chupchaap charaiveti kaa shloke budbudakar aage bad jate the
 In the same way, he went ahead with Patna's Navbharat Times
 aise hi aage chal pade outluk ke sampadak pad se
 Neelabh rejected political pressures and appeasement proposals with this mantra
 yahi mantra wo chetanashunya hone se pehle doharaate rahe or phir ek or yatra par nikal gaye
 Neelabh was really bored with that ICU
 khaali samay main kitaab padhanaa unki aadat tha
 But who has free time nowadays
 isliye ise yun kahana chahie ki kitabon ke liye sabase vyastatam dinon main bhi wo khaali samay nikaal lete the
 Reading before bedtime was his daily habit
 kursi main dhanse nilabh kitabon ke panne premika ke sir ke baalo kii tarah sahalaate hue work dar work palatate jate the
 And the subjects of study were vast
 angrezi sahitya kaa yah shreshth vidhyaarthee apane hindi prem main hindi patrakarita ko samarpit ho gaya
 But very few people had a similar hold on English literature
 saanson kaa anushaasan tod chuke nilabh ke sharir main lagbhag sabhi aantarik ang kharaab ho chuke the
 Liver, kidney and brain were completely closed
 nilabh ko samudr bula rahaa tha
 He had gone ahead to meet Neelabh towards that infinite alliance point
 nilabh doston ke hath ko kuch dinon tak sahane ke baad usee kshitij kii ore nikal pade
 In front of his stubbornness, all the efforts of his colleagues fell short
 vishwa kii sabase behatar mashine or mitron ke aagrah bhi unhen us isiu main roak nahin sake
 After leaving Neelabh gave his two eyes to someone and a vision for crores of people
 wo drushti hi nilabh kaa ham sab par udhaar he ab
 The biggest responsibility is to fulfill it
 hamane unhen isiu main kabir ke bhajan sunaae
 When the electric crematorium arrived in Chennai, the women shrugged
 koi puja archana nahin
 The slogans of Veeravanakkam and Inquilab Zindabad kept echoing
 main puri takat se kabir ke bhajan unhen sunaata rahaa
 Poems were read
 or nilabh in sabake dauraan dhooma banakar vyom main chaate gaye
 When i remember that there are people in our life who become the milestone for journalism, then names like Ajit Bhattacharya, Girish Nikam, Alok Tomar, Pradyut Lal immediately come to mind
 lekin jinamein samagrata dekhi, jinke jivan ko unki vyavsaayik pahchaan se bhi unchaa dekha, jinako dekhakar laga ki wo patrkaar nahin bhi hote to kitne ahm hote, us shrenee main sari khojbin jin do naamon par ruk jaati he ve hai prabhaash joshi or nilabh mishra
 Prabhash Ji lived more than Neelabh
 prasar ke hisaab se kahin zyaada karke bhi
 But after Prabhash ji left, there was only one revolt
 wo thor bhi chalaa gaya
 Neelabh went away
 usee raat dubai main abhinetri shridevi kii mrityu kii khabar ai
 The entire media went to cover it
 patrakaron ke bhi soshal profile isi khabar se ate pade the
 By Sunday morning, this tide had swallowed many major political and social events
 main asahaay sa dekh rahaa tha khaali dibbon se bajte tivi set or apane asal nuksaan ko na dekh paa rahe patrakaron kii nasl
 Perhaps this is true of journalism of our time
 shaayad isliye kyonki nilabh jaise kuch log ise jhuthalane ke liye maujuud rahe
 But these numbers are steadily decreasing
 or pesha iske saapeksh tezi se paagalpan banataa ja rahaa he
 It is really difficult and challenging to be in this blind time and blind races without greed

 For 17 years, the scandal and legal gripes of a scandal have led to many hiccups of ups and downs in Lalu's political career
 lekin abtak kanoon kii dabish taarikh par taarikh tak hi thi
 Today is the day of judgment after all the arguments and arguments

 kehete hai ki lalu pehle se hi tone-totake main bharosa karanevaale hai
 And when there is such a big problem on the head, then Lalu ji is ready to do anything
 khabar ye mili he ki kisi ne lalu ko salaah di thi ki ravivaar ko ranchi ke liye ghar se subah 11 baje se pehle hi baahar nikal jaaen
 After that the Muhurta worsens

 Great England batsman Geoffrey Boycott feels that the Indian team is no longer as strong as it used to be and now it has become much easier for cricket playing nations to visit India
 boycott ne kaha ki bhartiya team badlaav ke daur se guzar rahi he or unke anusaar kuch star bhartiya cricketer apane sheersh str se guzar chuke hai
 He wrote in his column in 'the Daily Telegraph', 'the Indian team is not as strong as it used to be
 unke do mahaan ballebaaj vivies lakshmana or rahul dravid sanyas le chuke hai jabaki sachin tendulkar utane mahaan khilaadi nahin rah gayi hai jaise vah hua karte the
 Boycott said, "harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan have been good bowlers, but they have gone through their best
 aap kah sakate hai ki bharat kaa daura karnaa ab thodaa aasaan ho gaya he kyonki hotel behatar hai, bade shaharon main english khaanaa shandaar he or yatra karnaa bhi aasaan ho gaya he
 His reaction came after England broke the myth of 28 years by defeating India 2–1 on their soil in the Test series
 cricketer se camentator bane boycott ne elister cook kii aguwai vaali team kii prashansa kii jisane shrinkhalaa ke shuruaati match main karaari shikast ke baad vaapasi kii
 Boycott said, "earlier this year we lost three Tests against Pakistan and one Test against Sri Lanka
 ham ahmedabad main pehle test main kaaphi kharaab khele or haar gayi
 Suddenly everyone in India felt that the England team would lose 0-4
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ve is tarah kaa jajba, drudh nishchay or kaabiliyat dikhaane ke liye prashansa ke hakdaar hai
 'boycott said,' England have now found a new opener after the retirement of Andrew Strauss
 ’unhone cook, kevin petersan, tej gendbaaj james anderson tathaa greem swaan or monti panesar kii spin jodi kii kaaphi saraahna kii
 Boycott said, "england won the series thanks to three big bowlers James Anderson, Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar
 ’unhone kaha, ‘elister cook, kevin petersan or anderson shandaar rahe
 We truly saw his world class performance
 hamaare do spinneron swaan or panesar ne do bhartiya spinneron ko pachhad diya
 ' mumbai hamale ke kasuurvaar kasaab ke baad ab osman jinda pakadaa gaya he 
 However, there is a dispute over who caught this terrorist alive
 surakshabalon ne yaa phir graminon ne? pratyakshdarshiyon or agava kiye gaye logon kii maane to aatanki osman ko jinda pakadaney kaa shrey graminon ko hi jaataa he, lekin sena, biguef or police ke daawey maane to aatanki ko unhone pakadaa he 
 It is necessary to look at the entire incident to investigate these claims
 udhampur se kareeb 15 kilometre dur biguef kii ek bas par subah do aatankiyon ne hamalaa kiya
 Two BSF personnel were killed and around ten injured in the attack
 javaabi karrwai main ek aatanki maaraa gaya jabaki doosraa vahaan se bhaag niklaa
 This fleeing terrorist later caught three villagers and asked them to show the way out
 gaanv vaale bataa rahe hai ki unhone is aatanki ko pakadaa he
 Obviously, the police and security personnel must have been looking for him and because of his efforts, he would not have been able to get out, but it would not be right to first take away the credit of unarmed by the villagers
 ab khabar aa rahi he ki yah aatanki faisalabad ke gaanv gulam mustafabad kaa rahane vaala he
 For the first time after Ajmal Kasab, who attacked Mumbai in 2008, a terrorist has come alive
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki aatanki kaa jinda pakadaa janaa bhartiya suraksha balon ke liye bahut badi kamyaabi he
 Vikramjit and Rakesh, members of the Village Security Committee, played an important role in catching this terrorist
 dhyaan rahe jab koi aatanki marane, maarane ke liye aata he to uskaa sidhaa matlab yah he ki vah fidaayin hamalavar he or use apni jaan kii parvaah nahin he
 Despite this, the brave villagers trained and specializes in the gorilla attack
 tippaniyan On the other hand, the army is claiming that the soldiers of its Special Forces not only killed one terrorist but also caught the other terrorist alive
 aisa hi daawa biguef or police bhi kar rahi he
 No one is answering the question how the terrorists have managed to break the security cordon near the Northern Command Headquarters of Army like Udhampur? baavjood in daavon ke ab jabaki bharat ne ek aatanki ko jinda pakad liya he to yah suraksha balon ke saamne kai aise raaj kholegaa, jo pakistan kii jameen main napak sajishein rachane ke daavon ko or bal denge
 With this, India's claim will be strengthened that the plot of terror attack against India on Pakistan's land is planned
 is aatanki se yah bhi pataa chalegaa ki vah kis aatanki sanghathan kaa sadsy he, pakistan kii sarkaar kaa in hamalon ke peeche kya ravaiya he
 How and when do terrorists manage to get through the border
 in daavon kii padtaal ke liye puri ghatana par najar daalana jaruri he
 a BSF bus, about 15 km from Udhampur, was attacked by two terrorists in the morning
 hamale main biguef ke do jawan shahid ho gaye or kareeb das ghayal ho gaye
 One terrorist was killed in retaliation while another escaped from there
 isi bhaage hue aatanki ne baad main teen graminon ko pakadaa or unhen baahar kaa rasta dikhaane ko kaha
 The villagers are telling that they have caught this terrorist
 jaahir he, police or surakshakarmiyon ko bhi unki talash rahi hogi or unki koshish kii vajah se vah nikal nahin paaya hoga, lekin sabase pehle use nihattha karke jakadane kaa shrey aam gaanv waalon se chhinana thik nahin hoga
 Now the news is coming that this terrorist is from Ghulam Mustafabad village of Faisalabad
 san 2008 main mumbai main hamalaa karne vaale ajmal kasaab ke baad pehali baar koi aatanki jinda haath aayaa he
 There is no doubt that the terrorist's capture alive is a huge success for the Indian security forces
 is aatanki ko pakadaney main gram suraksha samiti ke sadsy vikramjit or rakesh kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 Keep in mind that when a terrorist comes to die, he directly means that he is a suicide bomber and he does not care about his life
 iske baavjood bahadur graminon ne prashikshit or gorilla hamale main maahir aatanki ko dhardabocha
 The comments duusari taraf sena daawa kar rahi he ki uske special forcej ke javaanon ne na keval ek aatanki ko maar giraaya balki duusare aatanki ko jinda bhi pakadaa
 The BSF and the police are also making similar claims
 is sawaal kaa jawaab koi nahin de rahaa ki udhampur jaise sena ke nardan cmand ke headqwater ke paas aatanki suraksha gheraa tod paane main kaise kamayab ho gaye? Despite these claims, now that India has caught a terrorist alive, it will open many such secrets in front of the security forces, which will further strengthen the claims of hatching conspiracy in Pakistan's land
 iske saath hi bharat ke is daawey ko takat milegi ki pakistan kii jameen par bharat ke khilaaf aatanki hamale kii sajishein rachi jaati hai
 This terrorist will also know which terrorist organization he is a member of, what is the attitude of the government of Pakistan behind these attacks

 lekin isi ke saath vah yah kahkar asamanjas kii sthiti bhi paidaa kar dete hai ki namaaj agar masjid main padhi jaae to adhik sabaab miltaa he
 He makes it clear that there is too much politics on this
 ab court faisla sunaae, is paar yaa us paar, jo bhi court faisla degi vah sweekaar hoga
 In the Mudai Iqbal Ansaribabari Masjid, part of Islam, Mudai Iqbal Ansari says that whatever the court decides on the 27th, we are allowed
 lekin masjid main murti rakhi gai, masjid todi gai, faisla court ko sabooton ke buniyaad par karnaa he
 The mosque is a part of Islam
 masjid tod di gai, tab bhi namaaj jameen par baithkar kii jaaegi
 That place will be called Masjid
 masjid kii jameen naa kisi ko di ja sakati he or naa bechi ja sakati he
 It will always be called a mosque
 ham court par vishwaas karte hai
 Believe in the law
 court faisla kare
 Do it here or there, because so much politics has been done before it
 masjid main namaaj kaa adhik sabaab- haji mehboobbabari masjid ke pakshakaar haji mehboob kehete hai ki jis tarah se mandir main puja hoti he, usee tarah masjid main namaaj hoti he
 It is true that we can offer namaz anywhere, but offering namaz in a mosque is more beneficial
 isliye masjid main namaaz adaa karnaa adhik jaij he
 The court has given the decision, Namaz is not part of the mosque - Satyendra Das Ram, the chief priest of the birthplace, Acharya Satyendra Das says that before that it has been decided in the same court that Namaz is not a part of the mosque
 namaaj padhane vaale namaji kahin bhi namaaj adaa kar sakate hai
 It is not necessary that he should study in the mosque itself and should not study anywhere
 masjid main majaar main sadakon par har jagah namaaj hoti he
 It was fully understood that Namaz is not part of the mosque
 ab ek baar jo faisla ho chukaa he, us par dobaaraa faisla karne kii jarurat kyon hui, isko to 27 taarikh kaa faisla aane ke baad hi samajha jayega
 But the decision that will come will tell that Namaz is not part of the mosque
 abhinayta aamir khan shaakaahaari ban chuke hai
 But for a few days
 aamir khan ne apni aanevaali film 'dangal' ke liye puri tarah shaakaahaari ban gaye hai
 Even Aamir has given up eating eggs
 darasal aamir khan pahalwaan mahavir phogot kii zindagi par banne vaali film 'dangal' main pahalwaan phogat kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai, jisane apni teen betiyon ko kushti sikhaai or betiyon ne padak jitkar apane pita kaa naam roshan kiya
 Aamir has started preparing for this film and has become a vegetarian
 aamir ne kaha ki, "ji haa, main puri tarah shaakaahaari ban gaya hum
 i am not even eating eggs
 " is film ke liye aamir apana 22 kilo vazan bhi badha rahe hai
 Aamir told that "there is little time for the film to start
 taiyaari kar rahaa hum
 Weight gain
 dhooma-3 ke liye bhi mujhe vazan badhanaa padaa tha, charbi ke saath
 " gaur karne vaali baat ye he ki aamir khan apni sabhi filmon or kirdaaron ke liye puri taiyaari karte hai
 Even at the time of the movie Mangal Pandey released in 2005, Aamir left meat fish and became vegetarian because Mangal Pandey was a vegetarian
 is baar film 'dangal' ke liye bhi aamir kuch aisa hi karne ja rahe hai

 diwali kii taiyaari joro par he or tyohaar kaa utsaah bhi ufaan par he
 But a fear is also haunting Delhi and this is the smoke
 dilli main har saal diwali ke aasapaas hawa main pradooshan kii maatra bad jaati he or ye khatarnaak str par bhi pahunch jaati he
 Not only this, the change in weather after Diwali also increases the risk of pollution in Delhi
 2 din baad deepawali he or is maukey par hawa main pradooshan to ghulegaa hi
 But even before that the winds of Delhi are highly polluted
 lodhi road main to hawa kaa str nimna darje tak pahunch gaya he
 Outside Delhi Meteorological Department, air quality index is being shown through the screen in which it can be seen clearly how the air here remained polluted
 yahaan piem 2
 The level of 5 has reached 266
 yah haal tab he jab lodhi road main haivi commercial gaadiyaan pratibandhit he or yahaan badi taadaad main hariyaali he
 In view of the danger of pollution in the capital, there are appeals not to burst smoke crackers and reduce fireworks and people are feeling the same
 logon ke isi mood ko bhaanpane ke liye ham dilli kii sadakon par nikle, to pradooshan ko dar to dilli waalon ke man main dikhaa, lekin tyohaar kaa utsaah bhi is dar par kabhi-kabhi haaavee nazar aa rahaa he
 Rajiv Jain, who runs a cleanliness campaign group through Facebook in Delhi, has done cleanliness in many places under the Clean India Campaign
 log unki is muhim se jud bhi rahe hai, clin dilli ke mishan ke saath logon kaa judaav dikhataa he ki log na sirf apane aasapaas saaf-safai chaahate hai, balki wo saaf hawa or svachh vaataavaran ke liye bhi apana yogadan karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 But for this there is a need to create awareness among them
 isliye is baar group kii taraf se logon ko tyohaar is tarah se manaane kii apil kii ja rahi he, jisamen pradooshan kam se kam ho or utsaah main koi kami na aae
 DK Sharma, who pledged to clean up the dirt on the streets of the city, also believes that in the excitement of the festival, people forget that pollution and dirt is not good for their health
 isaki jimmedaari samaaj kii bhi he ki gandagi ko na failane den or logon main jaagarukta laaen
 Political parties in Delhi also know that pollution is such a big issue, that is why people are being appealed to reduce pollution
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay ne kaha ki pichley saal sarkaar ne pradooshan ko khatm karne ke liye od-ivan formula shuru kiya, lekin uske baad pradooshan par lagaam lagane ke liye kuch nahin kiya gaya
 Now Diwali has come again, people are becoming aware and the festival has started to be celebrated in such ways with less pollution
 unhone kaha ki wo ummid karte hai ki log is baar bhi pradooshan na failaane vaale tareekon se tyohaar manaayenge, lekin sarkaar ko bhi diwali ke baad jo zehar dilli kii hawa main ghulata he uske liye pehle se taiyaari kerani chahie thi
 Now Diwali is near and people are ready for firecrackers, but they hope that people will at least burn firecrackers
 jisase dhwani or vaayu pradooshan kam hoga, lekin dilli ko diwali ke baad thand ke mausam main hone vaale pradooshan se ladane ke liye bhi taiyaar hona hoga
 Its best beginning would be to celebrate Diwali without smoke
 uttar pradesh ke shahjahanpur jile ke gaanv main gum rahe ek maansik rup se kamjor balak kaa gaanv ke teen yuvakon ne yon shoshan kiya or use nirvastr karke gaanv bhar main daudaya

 peedit ke pita kaa kahana he, 'maansik rup se kamjor meraa betaa gaanv ke kuch anya ladakon ke saath khel rahaa tha, tabhi unamem vivaad ho gaya
 They beat my son and tied a brick to his private part
 unhone iskaa ek video bhi banaaya or soshal media par viral kar diya
 When we came to know about this matter, we went to complain, but they also beat us up
 'police adhikari praveen kumaar yadavane bataaya kiunhone is mudde par sangyaan liya he or sachai kaa pataa lagane ke liye jaanch kar rahe hai
 He said, "strict measures will be taken against the culprits
 hamane video dekha he or us par sangyaan liya he
 The matter is still being investigated
 agar video sahi nikalataa he to ham doshiyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai karenge
 Shahjahanpur DM Amrit Tripathi said that the administration is leaving no stone unturned to arrest the culprits and ensure justice
 unhone kaha, 'banda thana kshetra ke ek gaanv main 26 may ko hui ghatana ko lekar praathmiki darj kii gai he
 The FIR was filed late as the matter came to our notice when the video went viral
 aage kii prakriya jald kii jaaengi

 All the parties have started preparing for the election
 aise main centre sarkaar kisaanon ko badi raahat dene kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The biggest increase in paddy MSP can be done so far
 centre sarkaar ne bajet main vaada kiya tha ki fasalon ke neutnam samarthan mulya (MSP) ko unki laagat ke kam se kam dedh guna kiya jayega
 So now the government is going to increase the record (the highest in any one year) in the price of paddy for this kharif season
 indian express akhbaar ke anusaar, dhan kii emspi main 200 rupee prati quintal tak badhat kii ja sakati he
 Significantly, last year the MSP of normal grade paddy was Rs 1,550 per quintal
 iske pehle dhan kii emspi main ek saal main record badhat 155 rupee prati quintal kii ek dashak pehle saal 2008-09 menupie sarkaradwara kii gai thi
 The first UPA government also made this increase in the election year itself
 ab modi sarkaar bhi aisa kadam uthaane ja rahi he
 The MSP is set to increase for a crop that is sown in 50 per cent agricultural area during the Kharif season
 isse sarkaar ke khajaane par kareeb 12,000 karod rupee kaa atirikt boj pad saktaa he
 Paddy purchase by the government last year was around 5
 5 karod ton kii thi
 Significantly, while speaking to sugarcane farmers last week, PM Modi had said that the plan to implement MSP up to 150 per cent of the input cost of crops for the kharif season will be implemented
 unhone kaha tha ki use is hafte hone vaali cabinet baithak ke dauraan manjuuri di jaaegi
 Presenting the budget this year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said, 'I am happy to state that the government has decided to keep MSP for Kharif crops at one and a half times the cost
 mujhe bharosa he ki is aitihaasik nirnay se kisaanon kii aay dabl karne main mahatvapurn kadam sabit hoga
 Apart from this, the government is also preparing to increase the MSP of pulses by Rs 200 per quintal

 bamushkil hi aisa hota he jab bharat kii jaani-maani badminton khilaadi jwaala gatta vivaadon main na rahati hon
 Jwala, a 30-year-old doubles player, a child of Indian father and Chinese mother, jokingly says that perhaps it is in her blood to challenge the established rules
 agast main shuru hui indian badminton lig (ibl) main kathith taur par galat vyavhaar karne ke aarope kii jaanch karne vaali badminton association of india (bii) kii anushaasan samiti ne apana kaam puraa karne se pehle hi is damdaar khilaadi par aaajeevan pratibandh lagane kii sifarish kar di
 Because of this, Jwala is once again fighting to save her career
 samiti kii sifarish aane ke mahaj ek din baad yani 10 aktubar ko dilli hycourt ne aadesh diya ki jab tak samiti kii jaanch puri nahin ho jaati tab tak ke liye un par lagaae gaye pratibandh par roak lagaai jaati he
 Many senior players resented BAI and its dictator president Akhilesh Das Gupta's decision, calling it "excessively strict" and "ridiculous"
 jwaala ke paksh main aae hycourt ke faisle ko in khiladinnon ne badi jeet qaraar de diya he
 But Jwala knows that this is just the beginning of war
 aatmavishvaas se labarej jwaala ne india today ko bataaya, “maine mahaj ek morche par jeet hasil kii he
 i have to win the whole war but they too will leave no stone unturned to defeat me
 main badminton kii bhalaai ke liye aakhir tak jang ladati rahuungi
 i do not know what i have done wrong after all or why i am being treated so poorly
 shaayad main desh ke badminton se jude pramukh logon ke ahan ko tusht karne main safal nahin rahi hum
 Jwala and her teammate Ashwini Ponnappa are the only pair in the country to have won a medal for India at the World Badminton Championships
 unhone july main sirf isliye aawaaj uthaai thi kyonki ibl ke liye hone vaali khiladinnon kii nilaamee main unka base prise 50,000 dollar se ghataakar 25,000 dollar kar diya gaya tha
 Jwala was told that even though his status is that of an 'icon' player, the players of doubles cannot be given such a high price tag
 is par jwaala ne kaha, “yah ghrinaaspad he
 
 
 This is not the way to start a new venture
 ”us vakt bii ne chuppi saadhe rakhi
 But on 25 August, an incident in an IBL match was attempted to target Jwala
 maamla yah tha ki is toornament main unki team dilli smashars kaa banga beats ke bich muqabla shuru hone se pehle antim kshanon main vipakshi team ne apane ghayal khilaadi honkong ke hu yun kii bajaae denmark ke jaan jaurgenson ko le liya
 Jwala, being the senior player of his team, took up the matter with the authorities
 isse tamtmaai federation ne jwaala ko kaaran bataao notice jari karke do hafte main jawaab dene ke liye kaha
 While the matter was still under investigation, on October 9, a three-member disciplinary panel of the Federation recommended a lifetime ban on Jwala
 samiti ne isamen ek or khel khelaa
 The panel said that if Jwala is willing to apologize unconditionally, BAI on "humanitarian grounds" can relax the major ban as they deem appropriate
 jwaala ne faisla kar liya ki ve na to bii ke aage jhukengi or na hi federation ke ahan ko tusht karne kii koshish karengi
 Jwala chose the court
 adaalat main bii ne aarope lagaaya ki pichley teen saal main unka pradarshan ummiido par khara nahin utraa he
 But Justice v
 ke
 Jain was impressed by Jwala and issued a stay order and told the Federation that he desisted from harassing the player without proper investigation
 jwaala kahati hai, “yah sara khel bade dilachasp dhang se khelaa ja rahaa he
 If i have committed a crime for which the sentence of life ban is free, how can i get exemption by just apologizing? ” Such orders which prevent a player from playing at all times are usually given only on very serious offenses such as doping or match fixing

 ”diggaj khilaadi rah chuke or maujuuda chif coach pulela gopichand ke is maamle par chuppi saadh lene par bhi jwaala khafa hai
 They have suspected that they are involved in a conspiracy against him
 jwaala kaa kahana he, “yah dukh kii baat he ki unhone is maamle par apana koi paksh nahin rakhaa he
 There is no such pair of doubles in the country that can replace Mary and Ashwini
 to aise main kya chif coach hamaare saath aisa hone denge or kya mulk ek medal jeetne kaa avasar kho degaa?”jwaala or gopichand ke bich puraani talkhi rahi he
 Jwala complains that when he became the national coach in 2006, he did not pay any attention to him
 ve kahati hai, “un dinon main sirf 23 saal kii thi or neshnal champion bhi thi lekin tab bhi bina koi vajah bataae mujhe baahar baitha diya gaya tha
 The coach had said that i am old enough in terms of sports and now i should give juniors a chance to move forward
 baad main jab main 26 saal kii ho gai to unhone kaha ki jo khilaadi 25 saal ke padaav ko paar kar jate hai ve behatar pradarshan nahin kar sakate
 It cannot be forgotten that when he won the all-england title, he was 29 years old
 tab main khamosh rahi

 "but Rao hopes that the situation will change when the National Sports Development Bill is passed in Parliament
" raav kehete hai, “hamen yah ummid he ki aisa sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main sambhav ho sakegaa
 “the bill proposes to create three bodies
 pehla apilet spotrs tribunel, jiskaa adhyaksh hycourt ke ritair chif justise ko banaaya jayega jabaki doosraa nikaay spotrs ellection kamishan or teesraa athiks kamishan hoga
 Its purpose is that the players get a chance in the National Federation

 Meanwhile, Jwala is beginning to think that BAI will do something to target him once again
 ve kahati hai, “maine jo mudde uthaae hai unka sidhaa sambandh is baat se he ki prashasan ko kaise chalaaya ja rahaa he or use kaise chalaaya janaa chahie
 These people do not like to hear such a thing at all

 An excerpt of the printed article in the face
 
 
 modi 2014 ke chunavi samar ke senapati hai or unke saath ab sabko qamar kasakar khadaa rahanaa hoga
 There is no magic wand in Modi's hand that he will spin the stick and there will be a change of power in Delhi
 pichley 10 saal se satta se vanchit endie kii susti dur hogi or vah nae josh ke saath khadi hogi
 The reality is that even the Congress has no magic wand, yet they have power in Delhi
 is satta ne desh ko chaupat kar daalaa he
 But she is enjoying the pleasure of power by tying up with other secularists, making the noise of showy secularism? That is, his face is masked by so-called secularism and Modi's face is Hindutva
 iske baavjood gujarat dange kaa aarope jaan-boojhkar baar-baar modi ke maathe madha jaataa he
 That is why many showy parties and leaders have blamed the 'BJP' on the Ayodhya scandal, with which the hunger for power has been erased before this and Vajpayee, Advani, especially Shiv Sena, were sitting with thigh thighs
 Modi is responsible for the 2002 riots in Gujarat, it is said
 phir aaj uttar pradesh ke mujffarnagar main sampradayik hinsa kaa jo dawanal uthaa he uske baad bhi mulaayam singh ke dal ke saath dilli main congress ne haath milaayaa hi he na
 There are riots in Assam
 vahaan congress kii satta he
 Riots took place in Kishtwar, Jammu
 vahaan abdulla kii party kii satta congress kii madad par hi tiki he
 Then why does the riot of these riots not stain anyone's secularism? It is also necessary to answer these ostensible secularists
 desh main in dinon aarthik araajaktaa he
 The Indian rupee is lying on the bier in a dying state
 uske liye modi jimmedaar nahin

 dilli main ek shaks ne apni patni ko jinda jala daalaa
 The accused's younger brother and an uncle were also present at the time of the incident
 aas-pados ke logon or police ne peedita ko maukey par aspataal main bhartee karaayaa, jahaan uski maut ho gai
 However, somehow the victim recorded her statement
 police ne aropiyon ko giraftaar kar liya he
 According to the information, this case is from Vikaspuri area
 parvinder cor (24) kii shaadi 2012 main gurcharan ke saath hui thi
 a few days later the in-laws' side started harassing her for dowry
 uskaa pati har roj nai demand karata tha
 This caused tension between the two
 beete dinon jhagade ke baad gurcharan ne use ghar se nikaal diya
 The next day, she went to the son-in-law's house to get her clothes
 use dekhakar uske pati or baaki logon kii kahasuni hui
 After this, the angry accused put kerosene on him and set him on fire
 sthaneey logon kii soochna par pahunchi police ne gambhir haalat main use safadarajang aspataal main bhartee karaayaa, jahaan ilaaj ke dauraan uski maut ho gai
 According to police, after the death of Gurucharan's father, his uncle Ravel Singh was also eyeing the property
 iskaa pataa parvinder ko chal gaya tha, jis vajah se vah aksar uske pati ko bhadakaata bhi tha
 He often gave taunts for not giving dowry
 is ghatana main peedita lagbhag 80 pratishat jal chuki thi
 Somehow he has recorded his statement
 gurugram main kathith rup se karani sena ke kuch gundon dwaara schuli bacchon kii bas par hamale karne kii tasviren vichlit karne vaali hai
 In protest against Padmavat, the anger of the Karni Sena's hooliganism is that they also set fire to a school bus
 sirf gurugram hi nahin, ahmedabad, elahabaad, jaipur sahit bijepi shasit rajyon ke kai shaharon main karani sena ke updrav kii khabaren ai hai
 Most of the fierce performance of the Karni Sena is taking place in the BJP ruled states, in such a situation, the question has started to arise whether the bjp's state governments are proving to be incompetent in dealing with this alleged army's hooliganism
 The investment in these states can also be affected by such situations
 is aakshamata kii sabase badi udhaaharan manohar laal khatter kii bijepi sarkaar he
 There seems to be no police name in Haryana
 har kisi ko phir se pichley saal 25 agast hone vaali hinsa yaad aane lagi he
 In another bjp-ruled state of Gujarat, Ahmedabad, the Karni Sena has fiercely cut back its opposition to the film Padmavat
 gauratlab he ki chaar bijepi shasit rajyon gujarat, haryana, madhya pradesh or rajasthan kii sarkaron ne pehle khud hi apane rajya main padmavat ke pradarshan par bain laga diya tha
 But after the Supreme Court order and reprimand, Padmavat is being performed in these states too
 mahaj chunavi raajnneeti ke phaayde ke liye in sarkaron kaa khulkar is bheed ke saath aana chakit karne vaali baat thi
 The four state governments had raised their hands that if there was a problem of law and order after the performance of Padmavat, they would not be able to do anything
 lekin ab supreme court ke aadesh ke baavjood chaaron rajyon main prashasan kuch khaas karata nahin dikh rahaa
 In such a situation, the court will have to question these states strictly whether law and order is part of the state government and whether they are able to maintain peace and order within the border of their state
 Out of fear, no ruling leader of these states is making any provocative statements, but everyone knows that chaotic elements are out of control
 do din pehle hi piem modi daavos main duniya ke diggaj kaarobaariyon ko bharat main nivesh kaa nyotaa dekar aae hai, kya aisa lagata he ki koi bhi samajhadaar niveshak bijepi shasit in rajyon main nivesh karnaa chahega jo nunatam sweekaarya kanoon-vyavastha bhi sunishchit nahin kar paa rahe hon?uttar bharat ke rajyon main kamjor buniyadi dhaanche or kanoon-vyavastha kii samasya kii vajah se pehle se hi nivesh kam hota rahaa he
 In such a scenario, such examples will only discourage investors
 yahaan tak ki dakshin bhartiya rajyakeral menhaal main yah dekha gaya ki sipiem-areesus kii hinsa kii vajah se vahaan ab nivesh pehle kii tulana main gata he
 Already in North India, the guardians, the contractors of ethics have been raising the problem of law and order
 ye log bharat kii samaveshi chhavi ko kharaab kar rahe hai

 a grand swearing-in ceremony is scheduled to take place at the historic Shivaji Park in Mumbai, but before that the Bombay High Court has received strong comments
 hai court kaa kahana he, ‘is tarah ke kaarykram ke liye saarvajanik maidan kaa istemaal karnaa sahi nahin he, aisa baar-baar nahin hona chahie
 "according to the news agency PTI, a bench of Justice SC Dharmadhikari and RI Chagla of the Bombay High Court said on Wednesday," If this happens then more such programs will be on the public ground

 Uddhav Thackeray will take oath as Chief Minister at 40, besides many ministers will also take oath

 However, during this time the High Court also said that we are not saying anything about tomorrow's ceremony, just that we are praying that no such cases come forward
 ’ ek enjio ke dwaara uddhav thakare ke shapath grahan samaaroh ke khilaaf yachika daayar kii gai thi
 In fact, in 2010, the Bombay High Court declared the area around Shivaji Park as a Silence Zone, after which there was an objection to such a program

 Indu Harikumar's apartment on the outskirts of Mumbai in the year 1995 was the 19th house in the city which had an internet connection

 They ranged from romantic-comedy to stories of risk and danger, and Harikumar found that he had a plethora of requests to make pictures depicting these stories
 unke fasebuk or instagram ke pej aise plateform ban gaye jahaan unhen apni kala ke kadradaan hasil hue or unke kahanikaron ko apane tajurbon kaa kadradaan mila
 She says, "hearing people's stories and seeing them written in their own unique way is an experience in which half-thoughts are transformed into the ideological foundations of the new project
 '' unhone yah bhi paaya ki samvedansheel chizon ke bare main bolne kii jhijak or rukaawat jab ek baar tut jaati he, to or bhi zyada chijen nikalakar aane lagati hai
 His Instagram page has become not only a place for artistic expression, but also a platform for appreciation and acceptance of the human body, disrespect, disrespect and embarrassment
 harikumar kaa tarika alahada he
 Rather than recounting rhetoric and stereotypical principles, his paintings give more space to many dialogues about sex and sexuality
 unhen lagata he ki yahi project print main saakaar nahin ho saktaa tha, ve kahati hai, soshal media par main banisbatan aaazaad hum
 In the beginning, his characters were often blueprints
 ab unhen zyada saahsee dhang se bayaan kiya jane laga he
 His paintings have written rave reviews in the international press of narration work and stories of desire

 ) hyderabad main bheed bhare charminar ilaake main diardio ke ek varisht adhikari ko ek naaballig ‘jebkatre’ ne kathith taur par tab chaaku ghonp diya jab kuch logon ne ladke ko pakadaney ke liye uskaa peechha kiya
 Police said RK Satapathy, the regional director of DRDO unit at Koraput, was immediately rushed to a government hospital and his condition is out of danger
 raksha anusandhan evam vikaas sanghathan (diardio) ne kaha ki is ghatana kaa ‘diardio maamle’ se koi sambandh nahin he
 ACP (charminar Block) d Venkat Narsai said, "satpati, who was shopping in Char Minar area, was allegedly attacked by a minor picket with a knife when some people were chasing her
" ’shuruaati jaanch ke aadhaar par asipi ne kaha, ‘kishor jebkatra whitenor soonghney kaa aadi lagata he
 Some people chased and beaten him near Charminar area
 diardio adhikari nikat hi khadey the or ladkaa hamalaa kar bhaag gaya
 Police said the boy managed to escape and an attempt is being made to apprehend him
 varisht police adhikari ne bataaya, ‘diardio adhikari ko turant ek aspataal le jaaya gaya or unki sthiti khatre se baahar he
 Director of Public Relations Directorate of DRDO, Ravi Kumar Gupta said that the Regional Director of the Regional Center for Military Airworthyness was here on a tour
 ghatana kaa ‘diardio maamle’ se lenaa dena nahin he
 The battle has started realistically with the Election Commission playing the bugle for the Lok Sabha elections
 chunaav marathon daud ke saath hi ek lambii baadha daud bhi hote hai, jinamein kai avrodh or oonch-neech aate hai
 Therefore, making a guess at the beginning of the race itself can prove fatal
 phir bhi, main aapako 10 aisi vajahen bataata hum jinase mujhe aisa lagata he ki philhal to modi safataur par sabase aage dikh rahe hai
 1
 aaj kaa chunaav mani, mashin or media kaa haiaaj kaa chunaav mani, mashin or media kaa he or team modi ko isamen baari badhat hasil he
 Never in the history of Indian elections has the media thought so unilaterally
 sattarudh party ke paas vishaal dhanabal he or sabhi plaform par voters se judane kii party kii mashinari bakhubi samyojit he
 In this way, the Congress looks like a second-hand old-fashioned ambassador, compared to where the BJP is like a shining, well-groomed absconder
 isamen koi achraj kii baat nahin ki bijepi abhi hi apane pratispardhiyon ke mukaable kai guna kharch kar chuki he

 ab bhi netaa number van hai modiab bhi mistar modi kaaphi gap ke saath number van netaa hai
 During the election campaign, Modi has shown tireless energy, excellent communication skills and the ability to strike more than the party's stature
 'modi he to mumkin he' naare ke saath bijepi or sarkaar ko sheersh ek karishmai netritv mila he
 The sound of compliments increases manifold due to the huge army like cheerleaders and remains hype
 yah 70 ke dashak ke amitabh bachchan ke movie jaisaa maamla he jisamen kharaab patakatha bhi film ko banpar opening se roak nahin sakati thi
 The huge stature of PM Modi is continuously giving energy to BJP
 unhone chunaav ghoshnaa se pehle hi itani reliyaan or aayojan kar liye hai, jitna ki unke sabhi mukhya pratidwandvi milakar nahin kar paae hai
 Yes, it is true that there is disappointment among the masses through efforts such as populist jumlas and frequent event marketing, which are often beyond the ground reality, but it does not seem to have resulted in the displeasure of the voters
 modi kaa gubbaaraa us tarah se phuta nahin he, unki satarkta se banaai kathor mehnat karne vaale 'karmyogi' or raajnneetik ichhashakti tathaa jokhim lene ke saahas rakhane vaale netaa kii chhavi kaaphi had tak bani hui he or balakot ko unke nirnaayak netritv kaa naveenatam udhaaharan mana ja rahaa he

 amit shah kii ellection ejineeringpiem modi or bijepi ko amit shah kii ellection 'ejineering' kaa laabh mil rahaa he
 In 2014, Amit Shah was in charge of UP and BJP got tremendous success in the state
 saal 2019 main party adhyaksh ke rup main vah ab puure desh main bijepi ke incharge hai
 However, 'one formula for all' does not work in Indian politics - the BJP has suffered major defeats in 2015 in Delhi and Bihar under Shah's leadership
 lekin sansadhano se labarej or nirdayee shah 'sam, daam, dand, bhed' ke murtarup hai, unka raajnneetik darshan he ki 'saadhan se zyada saadhy zyada myne rakhata he
 In addition, the Sangh's dedicated workers, booth-present workers and the bjp's strong organization make the party's reach to potential voters easy

 The Congress has not been able to maintain its momentum three months after the victory of the Hindi belt in three important states
 modi sarkaar ne teji se apni kamajoriyon ko dur kiya he or kisaanon, oonchi jatiyon, madhyam evam laghu udyogon aadi ke liye kai raahaton kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Due to factionalism, stratagem and decision-making, this old party is not able to redeem the opportunities for itself
 sach to yah he ki congress isiu se baahar jarur aa gai he, lekin use tatkaal punarvaas kaary kii jarurat he
 In states where there is a direct BJP versus Congress fight, the BJP can stay in advantage

 Leadership of Rahul Gandhi: Congress President Rahul Gandhi remains an enigma wrapped in secrets
 saal 2017 main gujarat kii ladaai or 2018 disambar ke vidhansabha chunaavon se unhen ek jujharu prachaarak ke rup main sammaan jarur mila he, lekin unhone ab bhi aisa koi sanghathanaatmak yaa maanav prabandhan kaushal, yaa prakhar raajnneetik gyaan nahin dikhaaya he, jisaki vajah se unhen satta kaa swaabhaavik daavedaar or samooche vipaksh ke liye aakarshan mana ja sake
 For example, he made no effort to reach Mayawati or Mamta on a personal level
 rafel kendrit unka prachaar abhiyaan bhi dodhari talwaar jaisaa he, kyonki isse krishi sankat, naukariyon jaise mahatvapurn masalon se dhyaan hat rahaa he
 6
 mahagathbandhan kii pahelivipaksh ab bhi ek saajha nunatam kaarykram yaa ek saajhe manch ke saath hamalaa karne ke liye taiyaar nahin he, jo modi virodh se pare ho yaa kisi aise samuhik netritv kii pahchaan kar sake, jo 'modi banaam koun' ke nerrative ko chunauti de sake
 Instead of fighting on a common front in all 543 seats, the opposition now faces the risk of split votes, especially in important states like UP
 congress ko yah sochna hoga ki yah chunaav uske apane ubhaar ke liye he yaa desh bhar main bijepi ko ghataane ke liye? isi tarah, mayawati jaise kshetreey raajnneetigyon ko bhi yah sochna hoga ki ve chunaav ke pehle hi gathbandhan ke bare main majboot nirnay len
 7
 aankadon ke hisaab se bhi bijepi majbootsaal 2014 main uttar or pashchim bharat main bijepi ko kareeb 90 fisadi siton par jeet mili thi
 This kind of performance does not seem possible this time, but this time also BJP can get 75 to 100 seats more than its rivals in this area
 yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ne 42 loksabhaa siten 3 lakh se zyada vot se, 75 siten 2 lakh se zyada vot se or 38 siten 1
 Has won by over 5 lakh votes
 to bijepi ko is baar sabase bade raajnneetik dal banane se rokane ke liye uske vipareet baari jhukaav kii jarurat hogi
 If BJP gets more than 200 seats, then NDA government can be formed again
 8
 There is a lot of discussion and enthusiasm in the opposition about the SP-BSP alliance in an important state UP like UP and in the same way Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's 'formal' involvement in politics
 lekin buaa-bhatija kaa gathbandhan ab bhi jamini samikarnon se dur he
 For example, it has to be seen whether Yadav voters will easily go towards BSP? Similarly, there does not seem to be any significant impact of Priyanka's entry into politics
 duusari taraf, bijepi ne upi main apana kaaphi kuch jhonk diya he
 If the BJP can win half the seats in the state as compared to 73 in 2014, then no one will stop the Modi government from coming back
 to dilli kaa rasta nishchit lag rahaa he ki is baar bhi lakhanu se hi hokar jayega

 pulavama, pakistan, balakot airstrikejayshriram se bharat mata kii jai tak, babar kii aulad se pakistani jihadi tak, bhagava dhari sadhu-santon se lekar sena kii vardi dhaaran karne waalon tak, modi sarkaar pulavama or balakot ke agenda ko aage badha rahi he jo ki rashtriya suraksha ko raajnneetik rivaayaton ke centre main laae
 This brand of aggressive politics may have limited impact in marginal rural areas and South India, but it can change quite a bit in urban areas and the important Hindi belt

 According to the new youth voter election commission 'hidutva' 8 in the country
 4 karod log pehali baar vot daalane ja rahe hai, jo ki kul matadaataaon kaa kareeb 10 fisadi hai
 This is a voter with no memory of the demolition of the Babri Masjid or the 2002 Gujarat riots
 yah vah yuva jansankhya he, jo modi ke 'new india', 'majboot sarkaar', 'haau ij da josh' jaise naaron se prabhavit he
 What affects this young population is that 'there should be a strict policy on terrorism', 'let's settle the Kashmir issue first'
 bijepi ke mukhya madhya vargeey hindu dakshinpanthi samarthakon ko 'badmaash' islamic desh pakistan se takaraav suut karata he
 If the opposition does not unite and push forward a more focused discussion on the economy of the 'farmer-youth', then the strong nationalism of the BJP will surely set the 2019 agenda
 sharten lagu:yahaan main saal 2004 ke chunaav ke pehle bane maahaul kaa ullekh karnaa chaahunga
 Just like in today's environment, it seemed that no one other than Atalji could become Prime Minister
 unka bhi phir se chunaa janaa aaj ke piem modi se bhi zyada prabal mana ja rahaa tha
 But he lost, as his allies of Tamil Nadu and Andhra, the two states of the south, were scattered and UP was not affected by the slogan 'shining India'
 koi bhi lahar rajdhani ke iko chambar yaa taatkaalik studio vishleshan se nahin paidaa hoti, balki desh ke aantarik ilaakon ke dhul-dhakkad main banati he
 For this reason, the behavior of the voter of India is somewhat like the weather of London, which always changes

 ) On Monday, the Congress attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the 'legacy' comment in the UAE
 congress ne kaha ki modi ko videsh main apane se pehali sarkaar kaa apmaan karne or bura bhala kehane ke lihaaj se duniya kaa pehla netaa hone kii sandehaaspad pahchaan mili he
 Congress spokesman RPN Singh said that this is not the first time that the Prime Minister has raised the subject of domestic politics abroad

 Another Congress spokesperson Mim Afzal said that the Prime Minister should have kept the dignity of his post
 agar vah desh main rahete purv kii sarkaron ko nishaanaa banaate hai to koi dikkat nahin he lekin videshi bhoomi par unhen aisa karne se bachanaa chahie
 RPN said that whenever the Prime Minister sets foot on foreign soil, it seems that he loses his mental balance
 videshi dharti par apane khud ke desh kaa apmaan karnaa aparipakv netritv kaa parichaayak he
 He said that such statements are an insult to the nation and should be condemned
 arpyen ne kaha ki pradhanmantri jab videsh main hon to unki aalochana karnaa congress kii niti nahin rahi he lekin aaj hamen majaboor hokar aisa karnaa padaa

 com / 8kkowvgf4j— Irene (@ireneiam4)september 23, 2018 Narendra Modi, who arrived in Maldives on Saturday on his first foreign tour after taking oath as Prime Minister again, fiercely attacked Pakistan in the Maldives Parliament without naming it
 unhone kaha ki pani ab sir ke upar se ja rahaa he
 He said, some people are still making the mistake of differentiating between Good Terrorist and Bad Terrorist
 unhone global conference ko jaruri bataate hue kaha ki aatankwaad maanavtaa ke liye sabase bada khatra he
 PM Modi said that it is a big challenge to deal with it
 hamane ise chunauti ke rup main nahin liya to aane vaali peediyaan hamen maaf nahin karengi
 He said that terrorists neither have their own banks nor arms factory, yet they never lack money and weapons
 piem modi ne pakistan par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki aaj rajya pryojit aatankwaad sabase bada khatra bana hua he
 He said that terrorism is a threat to the whole humanity, not to any one country
 yah sampurna vishwa ke liye chunauti he
 He said that the unity of the world community is necessary to fight the challenge of terrorism and bigotry
 bharat or maldive ke puraane sambandhon kaa zikr karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki bharat ke liye maldive se bada koi bhagidaar nahin he
 Relations between India and Maldives are even older than history
 sagar kii lehren donon deshon ke tat pakhaar rahi hai
 These waves have been the message of friendship between our people
 hamaari samskruti in tarangon kii shakti lekar fali-phuli hai
 PM Modi said that neighbor first was his priority and said that in good and bad times, we will strengthen our mutual trust more
 bharat ne apni uplabdhiyon ko hameshaa apane padosiyon ke saath saajha kiya he
 He said that India has stood shoulder to shoulder with Maldives in support of freedom, democracy, prosperity and peace in Maldives
 piem modi ne puraani ghatnaon kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki chaahe vah 1988 kii ghatana ho, yaa 2004 kii tsunami yaa phir haal kaa pani-sankat
 We are proud that India has gone with you every step of the way in every difficulty, every step of your endeavor
 maldive kii sansad se modi kaa yah sandesh kitna rang laaegaa, yah to bhavishya ke garbh main he
 But it is clear that PM Modi's address made it clear that he is standing on his stand of global solidarity and joint struggle against terrorism
 piem modi kaa yah sandesh aise main bhi mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he, jab unke duusari baar desh kii satta sanbhaalane ke baad padosi pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne kai dafe donon deshon ke bich vaarta kii ichha jaahir kar di
 On the other hand, there has been an increase in the activism of terrorists in Kashmir
 aatankwaadi siarpief ke camp par hamalaa kar chuke hai, jise javaanon kii satarkta ne vifal kar diya tha
 Since May 30, the army has killed more than a dozen militants in the valley
 piem modi ke sambodhan ko puraani niti main koi badlaav nahin karne ke spasht sandesh ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he ki paak ne aatank par lagaam nahin lagaai to bharat sargical strike jaisi karrwai ko anjaam dene se peeche nahin hatega
 Memories of school days will be well remembered even today
 jab ek classroom main kai chehre hua karte the, jisamen koi beauty queen, sportman, gocip girl, topper or koi phelior tha
 Not only this, remember the day when everyone would see each other's face at the time of answering the teacher's questions in the class room
 aise main hamaari class kaa topper student uthta or jawaab aise dena shuru karata ki sabaki bolti band ho jaati
 Teachers also do not get tired of praising him
 jab class khatm hoti to kai gocip girl ye baaten karti mil jaatin ki is topper kii koi to setting he teachers se
 Not only when you hear this, but today i laugh a lot
 aisi hi kai yaaden aap taaja karnaa chaahate hai to ham aapke liye laae hai skool ke dinon kii sunahari yaaden

 iraq ke sabase bade shiya dharm guru ne pichley hafte sarkaar se apil kii thi ki wo miljul kar nayaa pradhanmantri chune taaki desh is bure daur se nikal sake
 But even before the Iraqi Parliament was introduced, ISIS leader abu-bakr-al-baghdadi has shocked everyone by saying that he is creating a separate country called 'the Independent'
 is nae desh main iraq or syria ke wo sabhi ilaake or shahar aaenge jahaan par charampanthiyon ne kabza jamaaya hua he
 Along with this, his terrorists also announced the Islamic Khilafat whose dream Baghdadi has seen
 itnaa hi nahin bagdadi ko duniya ke musalamaanon kaa netaa bhi ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 For this purpose, ISIS has changed its name to the Islamic State
 jaankaron kii maane to bagdadi al-kaayda kii badshahath ko khatm karnaa chahta he
 In fact, Baghdadi has severed its relationship with al-qaeda long ago and now after declaring the creation of an Islamic state, it has asked all the Sunni extremists of the world to help it in this fight
 jaankaron ke mutabik bagdadi ke elaan ke baad duniya ke kai aatankwaadi sanghathan uske saath jud sakate hai
 Also, they can come forward to support him in the ongoing war in Iraq

 There he met a henchman of Baghdadi and at the behest of Usman Ali Baghdadi, in the ongoing civil war in Syria, ISIS participated in the war
 lekin wo bharat main kis makasad se aa rahaa he, ye ab tak kisi ko bhi nahin pataa he
 But the intelligence agencies fear that Osman Ali is coming to India at the behest of Baghdadi and his purpose is to come here and spread terror
 vaise bhartiya khufia agenciyon is baat kaa anumaan nahin laga pain hai ki iraq or syria main kitne bhartiya abu-bakar-al-bagdadi kii madad kar rahe hai yaa phir uski taraf se lard rahe hai
 But according to him, a large number of young boys from India have gone to West Asia and some of these boys have also been given military training by terrorists
 jaahir he agar abu-bakar-al-bagdadi ke badhate kadamon ko jaldi nahin roka gaya to wo al-kaayda ke baad puri duniya ke liye ek nayaa sirdard ban jayega

 By the way, to do MBBS, it is necessary to pass the National Entrance Eligibility Test i
e
 NEET and the candidates are admitted on the basis of its rank
 magar hakeekat ye he ki logon ko ek yaa do number yaa phir jiro number milane par admician mil rahe hai or ve embibies kii padhai bhi kar rahe hai
 Yes, according to a recent report, in the year 2017, a large number of students have also got admission in MBBS course, who have zero or single digit number in NEET (NEET) in one or two or both subjects
 times of india kii report ke anusaar pravesh pariksha neet main kam se kam 400 chaatro ko physics or chemistry main single disit main number mili or 110 chaatro ko jiro number
 However, all these students got admission in MBBS course and are also studying
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki in ummidavaaron ko privet collejon main admician mila he
 After this report came out, questions are arising as to what the significance of this test is
 darasal akhbaar ne un 1,990 chaatro ke marks kaa vishleshan kiya, jinka 2017 main admician hua or unke marks 150 se bhi kam he
 530 such students were found who got numbers in Physics, Chemistry or both in Zero or Single Digit
 neshnal testing agency ke hawaale NEET, JEE, NET, jaane: kab-kab hongi parikshaayenkya he niyambata den ki pehle is entress exam ke jariye admician paane ke liye ummidavaaron ko har vishay main 50 ank laana aavashyak hota tha, lekin ab kul percentaile ke aadhaar par admician diya jaataa he
 After which the candidates are getting admission easily
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki isi ke saath hi ummidavaar paise ke dam par admician hasil kar lete hai
 Admission happens without passing: It has now become easier to get admission in MBBS college, where earlier candidates used to score 50 percent marks for admission, now candidates can also enroll by securing 20 percent marks
 pichley do saalon se neshnal eligibility kam entrens test (NEET) main physics main 5 fisadi, camestry main 10 fisadi se kam or biology main 20 fisadi ank laane vaale ummidavaaron ko bhi medical college main admician mil rahaa he
 NEET: 49 questions wrong, candidates will get 196 extra number
 What is percentile? Please tell that percentile is different from percentage and it is based on ratio rather than marks
 50 percentaile kaa matlab yah nahin he ki aapako 50 fisadi ank praapt hue hai, kyonki yah anupaat ke aadhaar par tay hota he
 Here 50 percentile means half the children getting the lowest marks from the bottom, besides the other candidates
 bataa den ki percentaile marks or rank ke aadhaar par tay hoti he or neet main marks ke aadhaar par tay kii jaati he
 To know his percentage, the candidate has to divide the number of topper's digits in his number and multiply it by 100
 jo rigelt aayega wo aapkaa percentaile hoga
