 MP Udit Raj lashed out at the BJP for cutting tickets from northwest Delhi
 unhone dalit card khelte hue kaha ki kya mujhe daliton kaa samarthan karne kii sajaa mili
 He said that i have not resigned yet
 nirdaleey chunaav ladane ke bare main bhi abhi koi faisla nahin kiya he
 Having a press conference, Udit Raj said that i could not understand why this happened to me
 mujhe kuch kaaran samaj aa rahe, masalan 2 april 2018 ko jab bharat band daliton ne kiya, uskaa maine samarthan kiya, kya uski sajaa mil rahi he? 3 disambar ko supreme court ceiling ke khilaaf ramlila maidan main jo hua, uskaa maine samarthan kiya
 Was that a mistake i kept raising my voice against Dalits
 unhone sawaal kiya ki sabarimala maamle main essi ke faisle ke samarthan kii sajaa mili he? kya mujhe best parformens kii sajaa mili he
 Used to indicate to me that i am not going to get a ticket
 mujhe iske laayak bhi nahin samajha gaya
 i am suffering from this
 maine abhi tak istipha nahin diya he
 Before resigning, i will talk to some organizations across the country
 udit raaj ne phir doharaaya ki dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne 4 maheene pehle hi mujhe bataa diya tha ki is baar mujhe tikat nahin milane vaala
 He said that if i will not be given the ticket then how can i serve the people
 iske liye mujhe takat chahie
 Udit Raj made it clear that i have not yet considered fighting for independents
 agar main ladata to jeetne ke liye hi ladata
 He said that in such a short time, how can i reach the new election symbol to so many millions? Earlier, Udit Raj became a doctor from the 'chowkidar' as soon as he was ticketed from the North West seat of Delhi
 dopaher main uttar pashchimi seat se sufi singer hans raaj hans ke naam kaa elaan hote hi udit raaj ne apane twitor handle main naam ke aage se chaukeedaar hataa liya
 For the past several days, Udit Raj was skeptical about getting the ticket
 bijepi ne dilli kii 7 main se 6 siton par tikat kaa elaan kar diya, lekin antim vakt tak udit raaj kii seat par pattey nahin khole
 Now hours before the nomination deadline, BJP announced the name of Hans Raj Hans

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter dilli sarkaar main paryaton mantri kapil mishra ko modi sarkaar par tanj kasne kaa ek or mauka mil gaya he
 On Monday, Kapil Mishra, writing a letter to the Union Minister for Culture, Mahesh Sharma, appealed not to issue any such advisory that insulted the country and severely affected tourism
 aisi adwijuri paak-bangladesh main bhi nahinkapil mishra ne chitthee main likhaa he ki centre sarkaar ke samskruti mantrimahesh sharmaji ne kaha he ki bharat sarkaar desh main aane vaale videshi nagarikon ko ek visheshedwiserijari karne vaali he, jisamen kaha jayega ki bharat ghoomane aane vaale videshi paryatak skirt na pahanen, raat ko baahar na nikalen, akele na rahe ityadi
 i request him that any such advisory will cause insult to the country in front of the whole world
 kapil ne kaha ki aisi adwijuri to pakistan or bangladesh main bhi jari nahin kii gai, ki kis tarah kapade pahanen yaa raat ko baahar na nikalen
 'tourists follow the rules themselves' Kapil Mishra further asks, writing that this type of advisory not only tarnishes the image of the country but it will also affect tourism quite badly
 khud hi apane desh ke bare main negative adwijuri jari karne kaa ye duniya main pehla udahaaran hoga
 Even if there are some special rules at religious places, then tourists themselves follow those rules, then what is the need for advisory about the whole country? '' Such an advisory will mock the nation 'kapil Mishra Responding, he said that he pleaded with Mahesh Sharma ji that he should not issue any advisory which insulted the country or mocked it
 kuch dharmik sanstha ke niyam hote hai
 The tourists who come follow it themselves
 lekin kisi desh kii sarkaar adwijuri jari nahin karti he

 shahid kapur bollywood kaa ek aisa actor jiske chaahane waalon main nirdeshak se lekar film ke nirmaataa bhi hai
 The director and producer who worked with Shahid Kapoor turned crazy
 film bhale hi chali, na chali lekin nirdeshak-nirmaataa ko shahid apana mureed bana lete hai
 The effect is that the filmmakers already persuade Shahid for their next film
 vaise bollywood main tamaam bade staron ne nirdeshkon or nirmaataaon se dosti kaa jaal aisa buna kii kai baar duusare star ke ubharne kii gunjaaish jaise khatm ho jaati he
 But the point of Shahid is different, Shahid plays something like this in the character of the film, with the sweat of hard work, irrigating the film whether director, producer or choreographer, he wakes up saying that Shahid is Shahid
 shahid kapur ab apni nai film udata punjab main vyast hai
 The first trailer poster of this film has been released
 poster main shahid ne aisa luk diya he ki unke chaahane waalon ke munh se nikal hi jayega, kya baat he, shahid! (A poster of Shahid's film Udta Punjab) is film ke liye shahid ne lambey bal kiye hai, vajan bhi kuch kam kiya
 Worked on the body
 sharir par tatu banavaaen or puri tarah ek rock star kaa luk diya he
 Shahid is playing the role of a rock star in the film
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki film main shahid punjabi rock star tommy singh ke kirdaar main dikhenge
 The comments vaise bollywood main rock star par pehle bhi filmein ban chuki hai or kaamyaab bhi hui hai
 Farhan Akhtar, Ranbir Kapoor have done such films and the audience has appreciated their songs along with films
 ab dekhnaa yah dilachasp hoga ki is punjabi rock star ke gane logon kii jubaan par kitna chadhate hai
 The film is being directed by Abhishek Chaubey and the film will be released on June 17

 yachika main kaha gaya he ki unke paas 4 phone number hai or chaaro tap kiye ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, it has become very difficult to talk on the phone

 asia main islamic shiksha ke bade kendron main se ek daarul ulum devband se talim liye hue lakhon chaatr desh-videsh main faile hue hai
 This is the reason why despite keeping distance of Darul Uloom from politics, politicians have been knocking at his rate
 kehete hai, dilli ke takchat kaa rasta uttar pradesh se hokar gujarata he to pradesh kii muslim siyasat devband kii tang galiyon main aakaar leti he
 This is the reason that the alliance of Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), formed to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, will start its election campaign

 At the same time, the representation of Muslim legislators in the 2017 assembly elections was reduced by a third to 23, which is the lowest level after independence
 ab 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main muslim matadaata ek baar phir apana purana siyaasi mukaam hasil karne kii jaddojahad main hai
 Principal Prof
 Shibli National College, Azamgarh, the prestigious educational institution of Purvanchal
 gayas asad khan kehete hai, ''loksabhaa chunaav ke pehle ek baar phir muslim matadaata thodi duvidha main hai
 On one side there is Congress fighting the BJP at the national level, on the other hand there is a strong alliance of SP-BSP-RLD
 haalanki basapa kii rashtriya adhyaksh mayawati ke ravaiye ko lekar muslim matadaata kuch sashankit he
 The biggest challenge before this voter group is to stop the division of votes
 isi se inkaa siyaasi kad tay hoga
 "muslims vs
 Muslims" Before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, political parties considered the Muslim vote to be decisive in UP, but the results of that election changed this perception
 us chunaav main sapa, basapa or congress ne kul milakar 43 muslim ummidavaaron ko utaara par koi bhi nahin jeet sakaa (dekhen box)
 If you look at the candidates in the Muslim dominated Lok Sabha seats, the reasons are also clear
 badi muslim aabaadi vaali rampur, muradabad, sanbhal, bijanour jaisi loksabhaa siten aisi thim jahaan muslim mat bant gaya or bhaajapa baaji maar le gai (dekhen box)
 The same story was repeated in the 2017 assembly elections when the Muslim representation came down to its lowest level in the assembly (see box)
 par is baar apane paramparaagat voton ke jod or muslim maton ko bikharane na dene kii chahat rakhkar sapa, basapa or ralod kaa siyaasi gathjod loksabhaa chunaav main saamne he
 BSP national president Mayawati has not only denied all the wishes of the Congress to join this alliance, but has tried to isolate this party by publicly criticizing the Congress
 devband main ek badi librari ke sanchaalak or arabi vidwaan nadimul vaajadi kehete hai, ''sapa, basapa or ralod ke gathbandhan se congress ko alag rakhana aklmandi kaa faisla nahin he
 This has created a reason for the disintegration of Muslim votes
 ab muslim matadaataaon ko badi aklmandi se vot karnaa hoga tabhi ve apni siyaasi takat dikhaa sakate hai
 However, the bsp's attitude once again seems to be laying the foundations for the sharing of Muslim votes in the West

 At the same time, the BSP has prepared a basis for the sharing of Muslim votes by making Haji Fazlur Rahman a candidate from this seat
 elahabaad vishvavidhyalay se sevanivritti professor abdul haleem kehete hai, ''priyanka gandhi ke congress kii mahasachiv ke rup main sakriy raajnneeti main aane se pehle sapa-basapa-ralod gathbandhan muslim matadaataaon kii pehali pasand tha par ab congress bhi unke saamne he
 In the last Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, the BJP had the advantage of polarization of Hindu votes
 is baar bhi muslim maton ko hathiyaane kii hode main bhaajapa apane liye laabh kii sthiti dekh rahi he
 This is the reason why SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has instructed his Muslim leaders not to make any statement that polarizes non-muslim votes
 rampur main johar vishvavidhyalay main avaidh nirmaan ke mudde par sapa ke varisht netaa ajam khan or sthaneey prashasan aamane-saamne hai
 In the previous SP government, the demolition of the Urdu Gate on Rampur's Swar Marg, on March 16, by saying that it was against the rules, increased to such an extent that Azam Khan announced to boycott the Lok Sabha elections in Rampur
 minurity kaumi movement ke adhyaksh aasim aijaj kehete hai, ''dhampur main johar vishvavidhyalay or aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay ko nishaanaa banaakar bhaajapa sarkaar muslim netaaon ko uksaa rahi he taaki isaki aad main gaiyr-muslim maton main dhurveekaran karaayaa ja sake

 In Meerut, former party MP Shahid Akhlaq has rebelled against Yakub Qureshi making him a possible BSP candidate
 ve ab congress kaa daaman thaamne kii jugat main hai jo mayawati ko khatak rahaa he
 This is the reason that Mayawati continues to attack the Congress, accusing the Congress of causing damage to the BSP

 glassgo kaamanwealth games ke baad jimnast deepa karmaakar kii jamkar taareef hui
 After the Bronze Medal (bronze Medal) won there, he did not get crores of rupees like the athletes of Haryana, but he became recognized in the world of gymnastics
 ab inchiyan asian games se pehle export unase badi ummiden laga rahe hai
 Deepa Karmakar's feats in the 64-medal race at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in terms of awards and money did not weigh heavily, but Tripura's Deepa Karmakar has become a star in the gymnastics world, and her Produnova vault (handspring double front vault) The world over is surprised about this and that is why he is considered a very strong competitor in the Incheon Asian Games

 This is a very high-degree difficult vault, due to which Deepa got the medal

 germanavaasi bharat ke kendriya vidyalayon main apni bhashaa kii padhai ko beshak vishesh ahmiyat dete rahe hai
 So, the HR Ministry's decision to abruptly discontinue German education in these schools, made largely for the children of government officials and employees, was so hurt that German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about this And received an assurance from them to look into the dispute themselves
 is maamle se sirf germany hi hairaan-pareshaan nahin hua
 The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), which runs about 1,100 schools, also advocates for continuation of German language studies
 iske 500 skulon main kareeb 70,000 chaatro ne is bhashaa kii padhai ke liye 'haa' kii he or dusron kii bhi isamen dilchaspee he
 This was a new opportunity for the students of Kendriya Vidyalayas and it also provided an opportunity for branding of government schools
 vajah yah bhi he ki iske alaava kisi videshi bhashaa kii padhai ke liye sirf maderin kaa hi vikalp he or vah bhi mahaj chaar skulon main
 In an affidavit filed in the Delhi High Court in August against the PIL of Sanskrit teachers against the teaching of German language in Kendriya Vidyalayas, the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan said that the need to learn foreign languages is increasing in the globalized world
 jab maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne daleel di ki kevies or german saanskrithik centre goethe institute ke bich qaraar avaidh he to kevies ne kaha ki qaraar ke naveekaran ke pehle usamen sanshodhan kiya ja saktaa he
 The ministry's response to this emerged in the meeting of the KVS Board of Management
 27 aktubar ko maanav sansaadhan mantri kii adhyakshata main hui baithak main is par jaanch bitha di gai ki kevies ne is qaraar par dastakhat kaise kiye
 How the ministry and the KVS wires were entangled on this issue can also be gauged from the controversy over how to finish teaching German as a third language
 kevies ne mantralay ke aditol rukh ko dhyaan main rakhkar german bhashaa kii padhai ko charanbaddh tareeke se do academik varshon main khatm karne kii peshkash kii, taaki chaatro ko zyada pareshaan na hona pade
 But the ministry rejected the offer outright and directed to discontinue studies in between sessions
 bataur teesri bhashaa german kii padhai karne vaale chaatro ko ab academik satr ke aakhri maheenon main chhathi class se sanskrit kii padhai kerani hogi
 Justifying the decision to force students to learn a new language a few months before the annual examination, School Education Secretary Rajarshi Bhattacharya said, "do not underestimate students' ability to learn new languages
" " shikshavidon kaa kahana he ki echaradi se yah sawaal poocha janaa chahie ki usne tribhaasha formula or 1960 ke dashak kii rashtriya shiksha niti kii praasangikta or upyogita ko kuch zyada hi samaj liya he
 According to the trilingual formula included in the National Policy of Education of 1968, Hindi, English and any modern Indian language should be taught in schools
 iske peeche mul vichaar yah tha ki uttar bhartiya chaatr koi dakshin bhartiya bhashaa padhenge or dakshin ke kendriya vidyalayon ke chaatr hindi padhenge to rashtriya ekta majboot hogi
 But the exception to the study of Sanskrit or any ancient Indian language was also added to modern Indian languages
 yah formula kendriya vidyalayon main utana kaamyaab nahin rahaa
 Students usually prefer to take Sanskrit as the third language, because their parents often have to change schools due to the transfer and hence there is no point in studying any regional language
 phir, 2008 main kevies ne german, french, japani, maderin or spanish jaisi videshi bhashaaon kii padhai shuru karne kaa faisla kiya
 The study of foreign language was to be started as an additional language from VI to VIII and the study of German was started as a pilot project
 german bhashaa main chaatro kii badhati dilchaspee ko dekhakar kevies ne chhathi se aathvin kaksha tak vaikalpik teesri bhashaa ke taur par sanskrit ke badale videshi bhashaa padhaane kaa faisla kiya
 Maxmüller Bhavan / Goethe Institute began to help in recruiting and training German language teachers on contract, then its studies started
 goethe institute ke saath 2011 ke qaraar ke baad 504 kendriya vidyalayon main german kii padhai shuru hui or kul 68,915 chaatr pard rahe hai
 The UPA government had no problem with this, but when the Sanskrit week was celebrated in schools across the country under the orders of the Ministry of Human Resources under the NDA government, then the PIL of Sanskrit teachers came to the court
 jaahir he, centre main bijepi kii sarkaar hone se sanskrit ke saanskrithik prabhaav kaa mahatv bhi bad gaya
 a teacher of Hindi at the University of Delhi and a professor in the language group of the National Curriculum Framework in 2005, Apoorvananda explains that the Tribhasha formula was only a 'strategy' at the time, it was not intended to create a sustainable structure forever
 ve kehete hai, ''tribhaasha formula us samay bharat kii vividhta ko dhyaan main rakhkar raashtra nirmaan kii chintaaon ke saath taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 The formula was not created because there is no further experimentation in it
 is maamle main gaharaa vivaad he ki shastreey bhashaa sanskrit ko aadhunik kaal kii jeevant bhartiya bhashaa kaise mana jaae
 Of course, it should be taught as an ancient language, but it is taught as a carrier of civilization, especially Hindu culture and values
 is vivaad ne kootnithik taapmaana badha diya
 The HRD told German diplomats that the 2011 agreement cannot be renewed because it violates the trilingual formula
 germany kii ore se kaha gaya ki bhartiya kanoonon kii baarikiyon par gaur karnaa to maanav sansaadhan mantralay kaa kaam he

 pati ne patni ko shaadi ke naam par dhokhaa diya
 The husband said that he would take his newborn bride to Dubai, but who knew in Dubai's name that he would be cheated there
 kaise ek pati ne apni patni ko jismfaroshi kii daldal main dhakela
 a truth in which a husband conspired to destroy his wife's life under the guise of marriage
 ek patni kaa khaufnak sach kuch is tarah he
 He told me that i have to live with Shekho
 jab is baat ko manaa kiya to unhone dubai main hi mere saath marpet, ladaai, jhagada sab kiya
 i was told that be with Shekho, they will give you dirham, so that you will also live well and in me
 ye he ek patni kii khaufnak hakeekat jise sun kar har koi pareshaan ho jayega
 Unfortunately, this truth has now become a bitter reality of Shabnam's life
 aligarh kii rahane vaali shabnam ke mutabik inke shuhar ne shaadi ke baad saat samandar paar dubai le ja kar ise jismfaroshi ke daldal main dhakelne kii ek saazish buni
 The victim woman Shabnam (changed name) told that i was married to Mohammad Akiluddin, later moved to Dubai, then he told me that you have to live with Shekho
 jab is baat ko manaa kiya to unhone dubai main mere saath marpet, ladaai, jhagadaa sab kiya iske baad main india aa gai to unhone mujhe va mere 10 maheene ke bachche ko ghar se nikaal diya
 Actually Shabnam and Mohammad Akiluddin were married in the year 2009
 us vakt shabnam ko sapane main bhi gumaan nahin tha ki uskaa shuhar hi use zindagi bhar naa bhuulane vaala ek zakhm de jayega
 Upon reaching Dubai, Shabnam's husband showed his complexion and made preparations to bring him to hell with Jismfaroshi and he was also beaten up for his refusal
 isi dauraan shabnam ko pataa chalaa ki khud ko ejeeniyar bataane vaale uske shuhar ke paas koi degree nahin he or wo yahi kaam karata he
 Shabnam said that they only take us to Dubai because of the people, they leave us in front of the Shekho, apart from that they do not have any business or degree of engineer, how will they spend, they would take them to Dubai for that reason is
 ye hamen shekho ke liye le ke jate he
 They get married, they take a month after the wedding
 Everyone thinks how good the husband is
 lekin vahaan kii hakeekat to wo hi jaanata he jo vahaan jaataa he kahata he shekho ke saath raho ye tumhe dirham denge isse tum bhi sahi se rahogi or main bhi
 Like how a customer meets, he speaks like that
 isko shame hoti to ye aisa kahata hi kyon?kisi tarah lard-jhagad kar shabnam hindustan vaapis aa gai
 But when he complained to Akil's mother and his mother-in-law Rabia Begum, he also supported his son
 shabnam ne kaha isaki maan ko bataaya to wo boli kii acha to he, wo tumhaara shohar he
 He will spend the cassette
 tumhe dubai lekar isi liye to jaataa he
 With the passing time, Akil's reality began to be revealed to Shabnam
 shabnam ko pataa chalaa ki khud ko paak-saaf bataane vaala akil pehle se shaadishuda he or uskaa ek chaar saal kaa betaa bhi he
 Actually Akil's first wife also left him due to his antics and went to his home
 bakaul shabnam akil bihar kaa rahane vaala he or wo jhooth bol ke khubasurat ladakiyon se shaadi kar apane saath dubai le jaataa he or phir unhen vahaan shekhon ke rahamo karam par chhod detaa he
 Finally, when we arrived at his house to find out the truth of Akeel, there was a lot of difficulty when Akeel's mother hid from behind the door and closed the door of the house denying these allegations as false
 philhal shabnam apane or apane bete ke liye haq kii ladaai lard rahi he
 And who is right and who is wrong, it will be known only after the police investigation, but it is so important that the mother-father must do a thorough investigation about the boy before marrying his daughter with a boy settled abroad

 Meanwhile, on the question of session moderator Anjana Om Kashyap, senior poet Ashok Vajpayee said that the award-winning campaign of poets, litterateurs in protest against intolerance has indeed been successful in its goal
 ashishnutaa ke bare main ashok vaajapeyi ne kaha, ham ashishnutaa ke khilaaf lagaataar bol rahe the, hamen to ye tak kaha gaya ki 'juute maaron saalon ko', ye netaaon ne kaha
 Our job is to tell the truth, who doesn't say what we read
 
 Sahitya Aaj Tak: 'youngistan' likes the new Hindi
 He said, 'some of us felt that there could be some dramatic expression by returning the award
 jahaan tak meri baat he, mujhe laga ki meri abhivyakti safal hui
 For the first time we were on the first page, all on the news channel
 hamaari baat ko gambhirtha se suna gaya, jabaki vaise kaviyon ko koi nahin poochta
 'if the poem does not tell the truth, then why does the poet think that he will return the prize and tell the truth? Why did you or many poets think that by returning the prize, you will be able to tell the truth, did your writing become weak? On this question, Ashok Vajpayee said, 'actually many people have written us, they have not read it
 hamaari 50-60 saal kii kavita prashnvachak or virodh kii rahi he
 Even before Dushyant
 duusari baat, hindi samaaj aisa samaaj nahin he, jisamen lekhakon, kaviyon kii baat suni jaae
 'are today's poets writing openly against the system? On this question, Ashok Vajpayee said that Hindi poetry is really the only opposition to politics
 ham sampradayikta, jatvaad, dharmandhta ke paksh main hindi kavita ko nahin khadaa kar sakate
 Hindi maintains its sharpness
 wo sawaal puuchhati he
 Habib Tanveer had said that we are businessmen of Satyanam
 aajkal to asaty naam ke vyapaaree zyada hai
 Now intolerance has increased so much that it seems that all we did was small enterprise
 unhone kaha, 'hindi kavita is mahatvapurn mukaam par bhi satta ke virodh main he
 Power does not like such a thing
 hamaara kaam satta kaa na samarthan karnaa, na virodh karnaa he
 Our job is to say what is true
 'sahitya ajtak: kisi he nae jamaane main 'aurat kii kahani'varisht kavyitri anamika ne kaha, ‘suraj ye sochakar nahin ugta ki kaliyaan khil jaaengi
 Rivers do not flow thinking that civilization will settle on their banks
 isi tarah kavi bhi hota he
 Sometimes when there is a crisis, there is little theatrical expression
 gandhi ne yahi kiya tha
 When not heard, one has to adopt the Gandhian way
 ’kavi liladhar mandaloi ne kaha, main ek baat apane anubhav se bataanaa chahta hum
 Whether it is media, religion or power, there is always a question on the credibility of everyone
 is tarah kii sattayen hameshaa vishwasaneeyata arjeet karne kii koshish karti rahati hai
 But this does not happen in poetry
 kavita vishwasaneey tareeke se aati he, us par koi andeh nahin karata

 The Shiv Sena asked for another 48-hour deferment from the governor, which the governor did not accept
 ab rajyapal ne ensipi (NCP) ko sarkaar banane kaa mauqaa diya he
 Today, till 8:30 pm on Tuesday night, the NCP has to reply
 usase pehle ensipi ke sutron ke mutabik kaha gaya ki jab tak congress sarkaar main shaamil nahin hoti tab tak ensipi bhi shivasena ke saath sarkaar main nahin jaaegi
 According to the source, the NCP does not want the government to collapse in 3 months
 ensipi chaahati he ki rajya main sthir sarkaar ho jo NCP, congress or shivasena milakar hi ban sakati he
 Earlier in Maharashtra, the Governor did not give the 48-hour extension to the Shiv Sena, on Sunday, the Governor wrote a letter to the Shiv Sena and said that on Monday, he wished to form the government by 7:30 pm, on behalf of the Shiv Sena, Aditya Thackeray went to the Raj Bhavan to form the government

 "asking that if Congress leaders are not coming today, then President's rule will be imposed?" So he said that it is not necessary to come here
 phone par bhi baat ho sakati he
 Ajit Pawar made it clear that he has contested the elections with the Congress and whatever decision is there is with him
 shivasena ke saath kabhi hamane milakar chunaav nahin ladaa he isliye congress thodaa vakt le rahi he

 pehle to logon ko laga ki shaayad antim sanskaar ke liye kisi shaks kii arthi ja rahi he
 But upon seeing the bed laid on the shoulder, they suddenly stopped
 pataa padaa ki megha ilaake ke guhaaraam sahu ko khaat par letaakar bank le jaaya ja rahaa he
 People did not believe
 kyonki, bankkarmiyon kii aisi asamvedansheeltaa unhone isse pehle naa kabhi dekhi or naa kabhi suni
 Actually, Guharam Sahu is a farmer by profession
 unhone haal hi main sarkaar ko dhan bechi thi
 He was badly injured in the accident
 unka pair tut gaya tha isliye wo paise nikaalane bank nahi ja sakate the
 On the other hand, Nomini was his wife Rambai
 jiske paas grampanchayat kaa pahchaan patr, pati ke ilaaj kii parchi or bhugtan kaa adhikaar vaala patr tha
 Rambai was also unable to walk due to illness
 baavjood iske wo bank pahunchi or rakam nikaalane kii guhaar lagaai
 But the bank workers did not listen to him
 use har haal main apane pati ko saath laane ke liye kaha gaya
 Ultimately, Rambai told this to his family and neighbors
 unki madad se kisaan guhaaraam ko khaat main rakhkar bank tak le jaaya gaya
 In this case, the manager of the cooperative bank Thanuram Sahu argues that in the past many types of frauds have taken place in the bank
 biimaar or peedit graahakon kaa hawala dekar agyaat shaks unka paisa le ja chuke he
 So they called the customer to the bank
 niyamanusaar graahak ke biimaar hone yaa phir bank main apni maujuudagi darj karaane par asamarth hone ke chalate bank apane karmiyon ko sambadhit graahak ke paas bhejtaa he
 There is a provision of on-the-spot payment after completing the necessary formalities with his signature on the voucher
 lekin bank karmiyon ne is prakriya kaa paalan nahin kiya

 While presenting the first general budget of the Narendra Modi government on Thursday, Jaitley said, "we propose to set up four new AIIMS and Rs 500 crore is being allocated for this
 chaar nae ames andhra pradesh, pashchim bengal, maharashtra ke vidarbha or purvanchal main khole jaaenge
 He informed that six other AIIMS set up in Jodhpur (rajasthan), Bhopal (madhya Pradesh), Patna (bihar), Rishikesh (uttarakhand), Bhubaneswar (odisha), Raipur (chhattisgarh) have started working
 soshal media main ek video viral ho rahaa he jisamen ek tivi ankar apane aap ko modi media kah rahaa he
 After the victory of NDA, one anchor started running in the studio with the guest
 Some anchors also started doing Facebook live
 aisa lag rahaa he jaise piem narendra nahin balki koi patrkaar banane ja rahaa he
 All this gimmick happened because everyone wanted to express their love for the government
 patrakaron ke bich ek pratispardhaa bhi he kii sarkaar ke prati sabase zyada vafaadaar koun he? kai patrakaron ne mantri or netaaon se bhi baat kii honge, yah bhi kah rahe honge ki dekhie hamane aap kaa saath diya or aap kii party jeet gai
 These journalists once again proved that the questions that were being raised about their journalism are proving right
 aisi soch patrakarita ko khatm karti he
 Journalists should not be happy or sad over the defeat or victory of any party
 patrkaar ko apana kaam karnaa chahie
 The job of a journalist is to pay attention to the problem of the people, to show the problem of the people, not to sit in the lap of any party
 is desh main kuch aise patrkaar bhi hai jo sarkaar kii hameshaa aalochana karte hai, kuch logon ko yah acha nahin lagata he
 These journalists are abused
 pareshaan kiya jaataa he
 Many people also say why these journalists do not praise the government
 patrkaar kaa kaam sarkaar kii tarif karnaa nahin he chaahe kisi bhi party kii sarkaar ho
 The job of a journalist is to question the problem of the people
 patrakaron ko us din sarkaar kii tarif kerani chahie jis din sabhi samasya khatm ho jaye
 If 90 percent of the people in the country are happy and 10 percent are unhappy, then journalists should raise their voice for these grieving people
 sarkaar chaahe kisi bhi party kii ho, patrakaron ko aawaaj uthaani chahie
 Journalism should not be dictated by love or hate towards a party
 left rhite centre main patrkaar ko centre main rahanaa chahie
 Staying in the middle should keep an eye on both the left and right sides
 patrkaar agar centre chhodkar left yaa rhite ho jayega to phir patrakarita nahin kar paayegaa
 Journalists in India are divided
 alag-alag kheme ke patrkaar he
 Journalism starts from there
 alag-alag kheme ke patrkaar apni suvidha ke hisaab se patrakarita karte hai
 Journalists of one camp criticize the government and journalists of another camp start praising the government
 kai log ise balance kehete hai
 This balance is not an attempt to prove his fellow journalist wrong
 jab tak ek duusare ko nicha dikhaane kaa swabhaav nahin jayega tab tak patrakarita aage nahin bad sakati
 Many journalists consider TRP as their success
 sho main agar zyada tiarapy aati he to usee kaa hawala dete hai
 Some journalists even flash how many tweets happened during the show
 is level tak patrakarita gir gai he
 Why can't journalists question the government in India? Questioning why it is limited to just a few journalists
 america main to patrkaar raashtrapati trump par sawaal par sawaal lad dete hai
 Why India does not get to see this
 2018 main jab trump ne press ko logon kaa dushman bataaya tha tab 300 se bhi zyada akhabaaron or patrikaon ne iske khilaaf sampadakeey likhane kii baat kahi thi
 But is this possible in India? TV channels and newspapers in India forward the news according to the party
 patrakaron ko hameshaa daayre main rahanaa chahie
 One should think about journalism
 kya bharat main patrkaar bhrasht nahin he, bhrashtachar nahin karte lekin patrakaron ke upar kaunsi sanstha najar rakhti he
 Who monitors journalists' earnings? What kind of post is given to journalists, if a member is made in the committee, then all this should be discussed
 aajkal tivi patrakarita kaa level bahut gir gaya he
 But our audience picks up the same fallen level and attaches it to the heart, looks at it, then our journalists say, see, TRP has arrived
 roj aise-aise mudde par bahes kii jaati he, jiskaa koi matlab nahin
 Neither society nor government benefits from such an issue
 lekin phir bahes jari rahati he
 Some guests sit and give knowledge
 shaam ko powder lagaakar, court taai pahanakar studio main baith jane se ankar patrkaar nahin ban jate
 Anchors have to change their thinking
 ground par utarana padegaa, ground report kerani padengi, logon kii samasyaon ko dikhaanaa padegaa
 This time the NDA has performed brilliantly
 is shandaar pradarshan ke peeche piem modi kii mehnat chhipi he
 There were many journalists in the NDA team as well, who are still batting openly for the government
 un sabhi ballebaazon ko bahut bahut badhai, aap sabhi ne apane team ke liye acchhee ballebaaji kii lekin dukh kii baat yah he ki aap 'main of da match' nahin ban paae
 Modi became the 'man of the match'
 sarkaar unki bani
 There is still time for you to return to the team of journalists
 patrakarita ke liye ballebaaji kar len yaa phir patrakarita chhodkar raajnneeti main puri tarah jwine kar len

 On the Insurance Bill, the government first tried to reach an agreement by calling an all-party meeting, but seeing that the matter does not work, the Finance Minister has taken a tough stand

 NCP leader Praful Patel said, 'we introduced this bill in 2008
 keval virodh karne ke liye iskaa virodh kiya janaa uchit nahin he
 The present government has even accepted that if we consider the amendment we want, then its opposition is not justified
 congress ke vakt kaa bill he jise endie lekar aa rahi he to virodh aakhir kyon
 He also appealed to the Congress to support the bill

 vipaksh maang kar rahaa he ki beemaa kanoon (sanshodhan) vidheyak select kamity ke paas bheja jaae
 The government on Sunday postponed its plan to bring the bill in Rajya Sabha for discussion on Monday
 sansadeey kaarymantri em vankeya naidu ne ravivaar ko kaha tha ki vah or vitt mantri congress or vipakshi dalon ke netaaon se is vidheyak ke vibhinn muddon par baat karenge
 The bill provides for increasing the FDI limit in the insurance sector from 26 per cent to 49 per cent
 naidu ne is vidheyak ko paarit karne main vipaksh se sahyog karne kii apil karte hue kaha he ki sarkaar vipaksh ke kisi bhi arthpurna suzav par gaur karne ke liye taiyaar he
 The bill has an exemption of up to 49 per cent of foreign equity in insurance companies
 saath main shart he ki inkaa prabandhkeey niyantran bhartiya bhagidaaron ke hi haath main hoga

 Chandrakitab: Representative Telugu Stories of Female Liberation el
 Reddy Prakasak: i want to assure you that Hindi translation of other languages is not only a medium to reach literature and litterateur but also introduce the changes happening in the society
 iske saath hi stri mukti ke sawaal or usamen antarnihit sangharshon kii vyakhya karne main madad karti he
 It also calls for intervention in it
 jeel reddy dwaara sankalit or anuvaadit pustak ‘stri-mukti kii pratinidhi telegu kahaniyaan’ stri sangharsh or stri mukti kii jaddojahad ko saamne laati he
 The book not only tried to show the will power of women, the ability to make independent decisions, the courage to fulfill the resolution, but also included the creations of Muslim women who have been imprisoned in homes in the name of religion
 is sangrah main tripuraneni gopichand kii kahani ‘ye patit log’ padhane par aisa lagata he ki duniya kitni bhi aage bad gai ho lekin aaj bhi nimna jati or mahila abhishpt jivan jeene ko majaboor hai
 But this is where the story explains real life
 vahiin bhavishya kii ruparekha bhi taiyaar karti he
 Through the 'eluru Jaana Hai' story, Cha So explains how social and economic systems push women to collapse
 is kahani kaa marm isse samajha ja saktaa ki santan kaa na hona aaj bhi samaaj main abhishaap or kunthit karne vaala he balki mahilaon ko samaaj se algaav paidaa karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 'stree Shiksha' written by Bhandru Achchamba in 1902 in dialogue style is a unique story in you
 yah kahani stri shiksha ke mahatv ko bahut hi oonche str tak pahunchaati he
 This story helps to bring the question of female equality and freedom to the sufferings of the whole world
 vaishvikaran ke daur main paidaa hui ladakiyon kii kya sthiti hoti he, iskaa jeeta jaagta udhaaharan kahani ‘meraa naam kya he?’ main spasht hota he
 As soon as the name of the story is blurred from his mind, he ceases to exist
 vah pati, bacchon va anya rishton ke sahare jiti he
 When she learns that her name is Sharda, she remembers everything that she came first in the tenth, the first music competition
 vah ek acchhee chitrakaar thi
 She finds the reason for this unknown, "all the food in my mind is filled to the brim and there is no scope for anything
" ” yah kahani vidroh bhi karti he apane astitv or pahchaan ko banane ke liye apane pati se sangharsh karti he- “ghar ko lipane-potne se tyohaar nahi ho jaataa
 Yes, one more thing
 aaj se aap mujhe i, oy kahkar mat bulaaie
 My name is Sharda
 '' yah bahut hi maarmik or dil main halchal paidaa karne vaali kahani he
 'ash-tre' is the story of a girl who wants to live her life in her own way
 usne apane hath ke kaaran shaadi nahin kii
 As a result, she stands on her feet today, she has a reputation in society as the principal of a college, a skilled administrator with a good personality
 ‘bivi ke naam prem-patr’ kahani main bahut hi rochak tareeke se pati-patni ke sambandhon ko nae sire se samajhane kii koshish kii gai he
 The wife is not the only one to do her household chores
 prem kaa apana soundarya bodh hota he yadi vah nahin to kuch bhi nahin
 The question of women's emancipation is progressing continuously and discussions are taking place afresh
 vah ghar or baahar donon jagah samaan rup se hamaari chetana main upasthit he
 But everywhere women have to contend with the feudal and maleistic mindset
 kahani ‘sangharsh’ main jab lalita kaa pati talaak kii baat karata he to vah tamaam, sawaalon, ulajhanon or antardvandvon ko hal karti hui faisla karti he ki “ab mujhe jivan main ek nayaa sangharsh karnaa he ek manushya kii tarah apane hi sahare khadey hona he”
 Thus, this story raises the question of women's liberation to economic freedom that the beginning of women's liberation begins with economic dependence
 is kahani sankalan main ek mahatvapurn baat saamne aati he ki muslim mahila lekhikaon ne bhi un muddon ko saamne rakhaa he jiskaa zikr aamtaur par nahin kiya jaataa
 Secondly, the stories of male writers have also been included in this compilation, which gives a feeling that the question of women's liberation in Telugu literature is being discussed afresh
 mahila mukti kaa prashn stri evam purush ke liye saajha prashn he, saajha hastkshep he, saajha sangharsh or saajha sapana he

 There should be complete information about every woman, man, youth of your booth
 apane booth ko itnaa majboot karen ki har ek vot booth kaa bijepi ko pade
 JP Nadda said that politics was first a place to eat food, there was a place of power in their families, there was a place to pursue the family, there was a place for corruption, but PM Narendra Modi has changed the culture of the country's politics 
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa kaa koi bhi kaaryakarta raajnneetik prishthbhumi se nahin aata, apane mehnat or karm se vah booth kaa adhyaksh banataa he

 The case of terror of monkeys in various parts of Bihar arose in Bihar Legislative Assembly
 sadasyon ne tahaakon ke bich kaha ki uddand bandar mahilaon ko pareshaan karte hai or fasalon ko kshati pahunchaate hai
 BJP mlas Vinod Singh and Bhagirathi Devi Sathi Many legislators said that there is a lot of terror of monkeys in their constituencies
 ve logon ko kaaphi pareshaan karte hai
 Damage the crop
 jab upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne bandaron par niyantran ke kargar samaadhaan kii laachaari dikhaai to sadasyon ne apane apane str se samasya ke nidaan sujhaaye
 Pranpur MLA Vinod Singh of Katihar district said, 'there is a terror of 700 monkeys in their area
 bandaron ne purv mukhiya kii patni ke saath chhedchhad bhi kiya he
 'the whole house started laughing at what the BJP members said and many members mockingly described the monkeys' emergence as an international problem between India and Nepal, as the monkeys flee Bihar to Nepal
 rajd vidhayak raghavendra pratap singh ne kaha, ‘yah ek antarrashtriya samasya he or bharat sarkaar ko isse avgat karana chahie
 'ramnagar MLA from West Champaran Bhagirathi Devi said in Bhojpuri,' The monkeys run away with the cooked bread of the women
 koi jugad kar samasya kaa samaadhaan kiya jaae
 'BJP member Arun Shankar Prasad raised a case of terror of monkeys in Basopatti in Madhubani district through a starred question in the House
 rajya ke van evam paryaavaran mantri modi ne kaha, ‘vanya pashu jeev kanoon ke anusaar bandaron ke kaaran yadi fasalon kaa nuksaan hota he to kisaan fasal kshati kaa daawa kar sakate hai
 There is a provision to give them compensation as per rules
 bandaron ke utpaat kaa sthaayee samaadhaan ab tak nahin khoja ja sakaa he
 Assembly Speaker Udayanarayan Chaudhary jokingly asked the mlas to find a solution to this problem
 uttar pradesh main priyanka gandhi ko mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par utaarne kii congressiyon kii maang lagaataar jor pakad rahi he
 Congress electoral strategist Prashant Kishore has also advised party vice-president Rahul Gandhi to field Priyanka
 upi ke nae party prabharigulam nabi ajaadbhi priyanka card khilne kaa taiyaar hai
 However, he does not plan to field Priyanka as CM candidate at the moment, but to get her campaigned outside Rae Bareli and Amethi
 lekin kya priyanka vaaki upi main congress kii duubati naiyya ko paar laga paaengi? philhal congress kii jo haalat main he, usamen shaayad priyanka card bhi upi main party ke liye bade phaayde kaa sauda sabit na ho
 Know why the appointment of Priyanka as CM candidate can prove to be a wrong decision
 
 
 1
 Seeking the right time to run the Brahmastra The demand for bringing Priyapriankas to the Congress repeatedly picks up because he is considered a trump card for the party and Congressmen consider him no less than Brahmastra
 lekin ye brahmastra chhodane kaa sahi vakt nahin he
 Congressmen also know very well that even on the power of Priyanka, the party cannot beat the SP, BSP and BJP
 isliye priyanka keelokapriyatako upi vidhansabha chunaav kii bajaay loksabhaa chunaav main bhunaanaa congress ke liye zyada phaayde kaa sauda sabit hoga
 2
 agar nahin chalaa trump card to kya hoga?congress kii kaman jald hi rahul gandhi ko milane kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 By the way, Rahul has not been able to do well for the party yet, but his real test will be after becoming Congress president
 agar rahul ke adhyaksh banane se pehle hi priyanka ko upi chunaav main utaara gaya or ve vahaan par koi karishma nahin kar pai to congress kaa sabase bada trump card phuss sabit ho jayega
 Politicians say that in such a situation, in the event of Rahul's failure, the Congress will have no option left and it will be right for the future of the Congress to save Priyanka as an option
 3
 No political experience even at the age of 44 Priyanka has no experience of politics even at the age of 44
 congressiyon ko siem ummidavaar ke taur par priyanka ko utaarne se pehle ye nahin bhoolanaa nahin ki nehru piem banane se aazaadee kii ladaai main shaamil the
 Priyanka's grandmother Indira Gandhi worked as Nehru's assistant informally for years and before becoming Prime Minister she became a member of the Congress Working Committee, the party's president, the Rajya Sabha MP and the Information Broadcasting Minister
 priyanka ke pita rajeev gandhi ne bhi piem banane se pehle youth congress ke liye raajnneeti kii
 He became MP in 1981 and in 1982 he was given the responsibility of organizing the Asian Games
 yahaan tak ki rahul ko bhi sidhe congress kaa upaadhyaksh nahin banaaya gaya
 He was made the vice-president of the Congress 9 years after entering politics
 priyanka ne to congress ke liye kisi bhi pad par kaam nahin kiya
 So it is not easy to decide to play big bets on them
 4
 Not seen in speeches, people see their grandmother's image in Damprika, but the granddaughter never showed the brilliance of Indira Gandhi in her speeches
 priyanka apni maa sonia gandhi ke saath saarvajanik manch par najar aati rahi hai or unke liye prachaar bhi karti rahi hai, lekin kabhi bhi ve apane bhaashanon or bayanon se media or aam logon ko dhyaan nahin khinch pain
 If she agrees to campaign outside Rae Bareli and Amethi in UP elections, then what is the guarantee that she will be able to garner votes for Congress with her speeches? With her face alone, she cannot cross the party
 5
 Danger for Rahul a large faction of Congress sees Priyanka as a better option than Rahul for the future of Congress
 jaankaar unhen rahul ke liye khatra bhi maanate hai
 In such a situation, if Priyanka gets a big role in Congress, questions can be raised on the role and importance of Rahul and who can understand this better than Sonia Gandhi

 a discussion on the Israeli model in Kashmir churned on the return of Kashmiri Pandits to the Indian diplomat's statement
 PAK has been told by a top Indian diplomat in mirchiamerica that India should adopt the 'israeli model' in Kashmir for Kashmiri Pandits to return and Kashmiri Pandits there Should be settled
 neuyark main bharat ke counsal general sandip chakravarti ne kashmiri hinduon ke ek kaarykram main kaha ki agar israeli aisa kar sakate hai to ham bhi kar sakate hai
 Pakistan has been stung over this statement by Sandeep Chakravarty
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khaanne kaha ki ye bayaan maanavadhikaar ke khilaaf he
 However, diplomat Sandeep Chakraborty later said that his statement was misinterpreted
 israeli model kii charchaasandip chakravarti neuyork main kashmiri panditon ke ek kaarykram main shirkat kar rahe the
 During this time he also discussed the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 is kaarykram main unhone kaha, "mujhe bharosa he ki jammu-kashmir main suraksha ke halaat sudharenge, isse rifusiyon ko waapas lautne main madad milegi, aisa hota aap apni jindagi main dekh sakenge
 You will be able to go back 
 
 aap apane ghar ja sakenge or aap suraksha kaa ehsaas kar sakenge, kyonki aisa hone kaa duniya main ek model he
 "actually, Sandeep Chakraborty was pointing towards Israel

 imran khan ne ek twit kar kaha ki kashmir ko lekar taqatvar desh chuppi saadhe hue hai

 unhone kaha, "maine apane coment par soshal media main tippaniyan dekhi hai, mere coment galat sandarbh main dekha gaya he
 " england ke khilaaf landan ke lords main 21 july se shuru ho rahi chaar test kii shrunkhlaa ke dauraan sachin tendulkar kii nazren antarrashtriya cricket main shatakon kaa shatak or 15,000 test ran puure karne par tiki hongi, jabaki bhartiya madhyakram kii diwaar rahul dravid ke paas test cricket ke itihaas kaa doosraa sabase safal ballebaaj banane kaa mauka hoga
 Apart from this, Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the most successful wicketkeeper of Team India, while Virender Sehwag, who is probably out of the first two Tests due to injury, can become eight thousand during the series
 lords main khelaa jane vaala yah match test cricket ke itihaas kaa 2000waan, jabaki donon tiimon ke bich 100waan test bhi hoga
 Tendulkar is just one step away from completing 100 centuries in international cricket and it is perhaps difficult to find a better place than the Lord of Cricket's Mecca to achieve this feat
 daayen haath ke is ballebaaj ne ab tak 177 test main 51 shatak kii madad se 14,692 ran banaae hai, jabaki vanade cricket main bhi unke naam 48 shatak darj hai or ek shatak or banaate hi vah shatakon kaa shatak puraa kar lenge
 Also, if Tendulkar manages to score 308 runs during the series, he will also become the first batsman to complete 15,000 runs in the history of Test cricket

 Yashwant Sinha was accompanied by his wife Nilima Sinha
 donon ne savere hi matdaan kiya
 Interestingly, BJP candidate from Hazaribagh seat is Jayant Sinha
 jayant yashavanth sinha ke bete hai or modi sarkaar main unhen mantri banaaya gaya tha
 But at the moment, the situation is different
 modi sarkaar ke khilaaf vipaksh kaa jo sabase bade mudda is vakt desh main chal rahaa he, uske aguva yashavanth sinha hi hai
 Arun Shourie, Yashwant Sinha and Prashant Bhushan are among those who surrounded the Modi government on the purchase of fighter aircraft Rafale
 yahaan tak ki pashchim bengal ke kolkata main trinmul congress adhyaksh mamata banerjee kii jis raily main 22 dalon ke vipakshi netaa pahunche the, us manch par yashavanth sinha bhi dekhe gaye the
 Not only this, he had also given a speech and criticized the Modi government
 aise main ab jabaki yashavanth sinha ke bete jayant sinha ek baar phir bijepi ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe hai to najar is baat par bhi he ki yashavanth sinha kaa samarthan kidar rahane vaala he
 However, when Aaj Tak asked all such questions, Yashwant Sinha avoided saying anything
 yashavanth sinha ne bataaya ki main yah tulana nahin karnaa chahta hum ki hazaribagh loksabhaa kshetra ko maine or mere bete ne kaise sambhala
 At the same time, Yashwant Sinha also said that i am a critic of Modi, but on the day of polling, i would say that the voter is coming to vote after making up his mind
 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main
 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special news letter bihar main tisare charan ke saath kul 14 loksabhaa siton par voting ho chuki he

 The five seats to be voted in Bihar include Darbhanga, Ujiarpur, Samastipur, Begusarai and Munger
 ye siten mithila or madhya bihar ke kshetron main aati hai
 The special thing of the fourth phase is that many stalwarts of NDA, Grand Alliance and other parties are in the election field
 in paanch siton ke liye kul 66 ummidavaar chunaav lard rahe hai
 Significantly, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, these five seats went to the nda's court, but in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA is facing a grand alliance, and it is believed that the NDA may face a tough challenge in this election
 bihar ke chauthe charan main apane har bayaan main pakistan kaa vija dene vaale bhaajapa ke netaa giriraaj singh ke saath-saath bihar bhaajapa ke adhyaksh nityanand raay, endie se alag hue ralospa ke upendra kushvaha, nitish kumaar ke kareebi maane jane vaale jadyu ke rajeev ranjan urf lalan singh, bhartiya communist party (bhakpa) ke kanhaiya kumaar, rajd ke abdul baari siddiki or lok janashakti party (lojpa) ke ramchandra paswan jaise kai diggaj netaa kaa bhavishya tay hona he
 Darbhangadarbhanga is a major city and historical place of Mithila culture
 yah seat brahman, yadav or muslimon kaa garh mana jaataa he
 For the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Grand Alliance has nominated RJD veteran Abdul Bari Siddiqui as its candidate, while the BJP has fielded Gopalji Thakur to challenge him
 abdul baari siddiki kii ginati rajd ke varisht netaa main hoti he
 Siddiqui has been a minister in the Bihar government
 gauratlab he ki pichley 2014 ke chunaav main yahaan se bhaajapa ke kirti aaazaad jite the, lekin bhaajapa se naaraaz hokar kirti ab congress main shaamil ho gaye hai or jharkhand ke dhanbad se chunaav lard rahe hai
 So at the same time Abdul Bari Siddiqui of RJD is contesting the Lok Sabha elections for the first time
 unhen mahagathbandhan ke saathi dalon congress, viypi party, ralospa or ham ke samarthan kaa phayda mil saktaa he
 But he is also facing opposition from RJD leader and former MP Ali Ashraf Fatmi

 39 fisadi voting hui thi, jahaan bhaajapa 21

 72 fisadi vot ke saath rajd dusre number par thi
 Begusarai, known as 'leningrad' and 'little Moscow', Begusarai seat of Bihar remains a topic of discussion all over the country
 kyonki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke liye ek taraf jahaan bhakpa ne apane firebrands netaa kanhaiya kumaar ko apana pratyaashee banaaya he, to vahiin bhaajapa ne apane sheersh bhoomihaar netaa or kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ko unke khilaaf tikat diya he
 So Tanveer Hasan has been nominated from the Grand Alliance
 haalanki tanwir hasan media kaa dhyaan zyada aakarshith nahin kar paa rahe hai, lekin unki maujuudagi ne is seat par chunaav ko trikoniya bana diya he
 BJP leader Giriraj Singh is contesting from Begusarai this time in place of Nawada, while Kanhaiya Kumar is starting his political innings from here
 donon hi bhoomihaar jati se aate hai
 Bhumihar, Yadav and Muslim voters are the future of the leaders from this seat
 gauratlab he ki saal 2014 ke aam chunaav main bhaajapa ke bholaa singh is seat se vijayi rahe the
 Bhola Singh scored only 3 to Tanveer Hasan
 28 fisadi voton se haraaya tha
 According to Election Commission data, 60 seats in this seat in the last Lok Sabha election

 In Ujiarpur, Ujiarpur Lok Sabha constituency, this time the prestige of all parties will be at stake
 is seat se is baar do diggajon ke maidan main utarane se charchaa main he
 On the one hand, where the BJP has chosen its candidate Nityanand Rai, President of Bihar BJP, it is against Upendra Kushwaha, the chief of RLSP
 dono hi apane-apane kheme ke majboot netaa maane jate hai
 Apart from this, Upendra Kushwaha is also contesting from Karakat seat
 aisa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he ki nityanand raay ko is baar jadyu ke samarthan kaa phayda mil saktaa he
 In this area, along with the Kushwaha votes, the strength of Yadav votes is also considerable
 upendra kushvaha ne pichhali baar endie ke saath milakar chunaav ladaa tha
 But in 2019, he is contesting elections with the Grand Alliance after splitting from the NDA
 gauratlab he ki is seat se pichley saal 2014 main kul (chunaav ayog ke data ke anusaar) 60
 There was 22 per cent voting, where bjp's Nityanand Rai gave rjd's Alok Kumar Mehta 4

 According to the new delimitation, Samastipur Lok Sabha seat is extremely safe for the scheduled castes
 yahaan kii siyasat main pichhadaa varg nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaataa rahaa he
 This seat is reserved for Scheduled Castes
 saal 2014 kii tarah hi is baar bhi 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main samastipur se lojpa pramukh ramvilas paswan ke bhai ramchandra paswan siyaasi maidan main hai
 So at the same time, the Congress has once again fielded Ashok Ram against Ramchandra Paswan with the objective of strengthening his political ground
 2014 ke chunaav main is seat par kul 57
 38 percent voting was done, where Ashok Ram was just 0

 30 fisadi vot mili the
 Earlier in the 2004 elections, rjd's Alok Kumar Mehta defeated JDU candidate Ramchandra Singh
 mungersurkhiyon main rahane vaali munger loksabhaa seat par is baar ladaai badi dilachasp hone vaali he
 Because this time the competition is between such leaders, whose relations used to be sweet in the past, but now these relationships have become tough
 yah seat bhoomihaar matadaataaon ke lihaaz se kaaphi mahatvapurn maani jaati he
 Apart from this, the role of voters of Rajput and Mahadalit community also becomes very important in this seat
 yahaan yadav, muslim, kurmi, or dhanuk jati ke matadaata bhi badi taadaad main hai

 vishaal jab aarti ke unke coment karne par gussa karte hai to aarti chillane lagati hai or bathroom saaf karne se manaa kar detii hai
 Talking about Bigg Boss, there is a lot of drama in the show these days
 contestants ek duusare se aage badhane ke liye kaaphi planning kar rahe hai
 In terms of entertainment, the show is doing very well and the audience is very much liked
 karnataka main nikaay chunaavon ke nattejey aaj (shuukravaar) ghoshit kar die gaye
 a total of seven Urban Municipal Council data released showed Congress winning 90, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 56, Janata Dal Secular (JDS) 38, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) 2 and Independents 25 seats
 
 vahiin 6 siten anya ke khate main gai he
 At the same time, the results of the 30 Urban Municipal Council elections were also seen going in favor of the Congress
 isaki kul 714 siton main se congress ko 322 par kamyaabi mili
 Along with this, BJP won 184, JDS 102 and others 106
 iske alaava 19 nagar panchayaton kii 290 siton ke nattejey bijepi ke liye santosh dene vaale rahe
 In which BJP got 126 seats, Congress 97, JDS 34 and others 33 seats
 karnataka main bhale hi congress or jedy(es)kii gathbandhan sarkaar ho or loksabhaa chunaavon main donon partiyon ne saath milakar chunaav ladaa ho, lekin nikaay chunaavon main donon partiyon ne gathbandhan nahin kiya or alag-alag ummidavaar utaare
 Regarding the decision of the two parties to contest separately in the Karnataka civic elections, it is being said that the activists of the parties at the local level have not yet accepted the state level alliance
 mana ja rahaa he ki donon partiyon ke bich gathbandhan khatm hone kii yah aupchaarik shuruyaat he
 There is no consensus among Congress and JDS workers to contest elections locally
 rajya chunaav ayog ke mutabik 29 may ko 63 shahari nikaay chunaav karaae gaye, jinke nattejey 31 may ko ghoshit kiye gaye
 In the Lok Sabha elections 2019, Congress and JDS contested together in Karnataka, in which BJP won 25 out of 28 seats in the state
 vahiin sattadhari congress-jedies gathbandhan ko mahaj ek-ek seat se hi santosh karnaa padaa
 One seat was also won by independents
 lekin isse pehle hi donon dalon ke netaaon ne sthaneey str par alag-alag chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Both political parties have been arch rivals of each other
 dakshin karnataka main donon ke bich ladaai badi dilachasp hoti rahi he
 But in the assembly elections held in May last year, the two political parties formed an alliance after the election and ousted the BJP from the government
 225 siton vaali vidhansabha main 104 siten jeetne par bhi bhaajapa nahin ban pai
 Party workers have not been able to come out even after the alliance due to decades of political rivalries, due to which the results of the Lok Sabha elections were very bad
 loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad karnataka main paidaa hue matbhedon se jedies-congress gathbandhan sarkaar sankat main he
 In order to deal with this situation, initiatives are being taken by the top leadership of both the parties
 lekin rajya main gathbandhan kii sthiti saamaanya nahin he

 jab gaanv-shahar or ghar-baahar har jagah naukari kii baat hoti rahati he to phir media main naukari kii baat kyon nahin hoti he
 While in opposition, the leaders raise the issue of unemployment, but do not tell about employment in the government
 yah baat har dal or har mukhyamantri se lekar pradhanmantri par lagu hoti he
 Look at the advertisements during the time of elections, there will be a job in the advertisement of the opponents, there will be talk of stopping the movement, both of these are not there in the government advertisement
 kitna palaayan roka or kitni naukariyaan deen
 Colleges in India are unemployment generating factories
 do tarah se
 One is the vacancy of teachers, due to which the youth who can become teachers are unemployed and secondly when there is no teacher, then your child will not be able to get employment
 agar yah photo clear he to ab aage badhate hai
 Ask the youth if you don't want a job, how much is the job share in your discussions and how much is the share of bigotry and bigotry
 agar naujavaanon ko berojgaare se fark nahin padataa he to yah raajnneeti kaa sabase sundar samay he
 Even if we talk about jobs, we have a solid foundation kya ham dharanaon ke aadhaar par naukari kii baat karte hai
 Do we have concrete figures about the job
 kya real time main kaam milane or gine jane kaa system ho saktaa he
 Can we count government jobs immediately? kya aap jaanate hai ki 365 se 183 din kaam miltaa he use hi lebar force main gina jaataa he
 There are 29 states and 7 union territories
 kitna samay lagegaa ki har maheene inke yahaan nikalne vaali naukariyon kii sankhya lekar twit karte hue, janata main vigyaapan dekar bataane main
 It should not take more than half an hour
 har rajya se yah aankada aa saktaa he
 How many recruits have come out from teacher to peon
 railway main kitni bhartee nikali he
 To know this number, how long will it take for Railway Minister Piyush Goyal to tweet
 10 minute had se had ek din
 Then why do governments in our country not tell their own every day how many recruits have come out in all their departments and how many people have joined
 india spend ek website he jo hindi main bhi he
 It assessed employment last July
 2015-16 main berojgaare kii dar 5 pratishat thi jo 2013-14 main 4
 Was 9 percent
 in aankadon se kya aapako thik thik andaaza hota he
 For example, how many crores remained unemployed
 kya aap jaan pate hai ki jinhen kaam mila, unhen kaisaa or kitne kaa kaam mila
 How many of these jobs are permanent and how daily are nature
 ham uniwarsity series kii tarah naukariyon par series karnaa chaahate hai
 We lack resources
 agar aap noujvaan jo din bhar koching centre main khape rahete hai apane anubhav thik-thik bataaenge to acha rahegaa
 In the 2014 elections it was promised that two crore jobs would be created every year
 magar kendriya shram mantralay kaa koi bhi aankada 10 lakh bhi nahin pahunchataa dikhataa he
 There will be labor ministries in the states too, why don't they release their data here
 shram mantralay kaa survey ho yaa aarthik survey sabamein rojgaar kii raftaar sust hoti dikh rahi he

 Between July 2014 to December 2016, only 6, 41, xxrep 4 0 jobs were given in these sectors
 july 2011 se disambar 2013 ke bich 12
 8 lakh jobs were given in these sectors
 12 lakh se ghatakar ham saadhe chah lakh par aa gaye hai
 These are the figures of the survey of the Ministry of Labor, which indiaspend
 com ne chapa he
 Generally, such surveys include the same factories where ten or more people work
 magar zyaadaatar log isse bhi kam ke samooh main kaam karte hai
 Do they count? kya unki sankhya se hamen rojgaar ke bare main koi sahi tasviir milti he
 Permanent jobs are decreasing
 cajual or kontract kii naukariyaan badhane lagi hai
