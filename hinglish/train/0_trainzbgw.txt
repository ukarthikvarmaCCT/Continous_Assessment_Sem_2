 According to the information received, the buildings built in the British era, including the Parliament House and the Central Secretariat, are proving to be insufficient to meet the needs of the present times
 iske maddenjar sarkaar ne raashtrapati bhawan se india get tak, teen kimi ke daayre main maujuud desh kii shashan vyavastha ke sheersh satta pratishthanon (sansad bhawan or kendriya sachivalay) kaa kayakalp kar nayaa swaroop dene kii mahatvakankshi pariyojna shuru kii he
 a senior official of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, who is executing it, said that the historical significance of the building of Parliament House, which is a 90-year-old historical heritage, cannot be denied, but it is also true that the current needs of the times are changed
 This building is not able to complete

 SP Rajya Sabha member Chaudhary Sukhram Singh termed the government's project of renovating or redeveloping the Parliament House as welcome, and said that the idea of arranging a separate chamber for all members was an effective initiative
 unhone bataaya ki maujuuda vyavastha main mantriyon ke alaava vibhinn dalon ke netaa sadan ko alag kaksh miltaa he
 In such a situation, the leaders and members of small parties with one or two members face a lot of trouble due to lack of space

 This problem was also anticipated by Mahajan in view of the lack of space in Parliament and the possibility of reaching the number of members of both houses in future delimitation to one thousand
 ise dekhte huye tatkaaleen shahari vikaas mantri em venkaiya naidu ne adhikariyon se naye bhawan ke liye jagah talashne ko kaha tha
 The lack of space in the Parliament House can be gauged from the fact that the leaders of different parties keep quarreling for the rooms for their party
 agast 2014 main tedepa or trinmul congress ke sadasyon ke bich kamare ke aavanton ko lekar aapasi vivaad itnaa bad gaya tha ki isaki shikaayat mahajan ke paas tak panhuch gayi
 Taking up the problem of lack of space in Parliament, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu also requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to extend the Parliament House till August 2022, last month on August 5
 is par modi ne 20 agast ko ghoshnaa kii ki sarkaar, sansad bhawan ko aadhunik rup dene sahit anya sabhi sambhaavnaayen talash rahi he
 It is worth noting that in the current system, the maximum number of members in the Lok Sabha is 550 and the Rajya Sabha has a seating capacity of 250 members

 ferozepur jhirka seat se bijepi ne naseem ahamed ko mauka diya he, jabaki nunh seat se jakir hossain ko utaara gaya he
 These are the assembly seats falling in the Mewat region from where no one other than the Muslim candidate has ever won
 isaki khaas vajah yahaan kii muslim aabaadi he
 Around 7 across the state
 2% muslim voters hai, jabaki mevaat main 70 fisadi ke kareeb muslim aabaadi he
 In such a situation, BJP has also placed bets on Muslim faces this time
 sirf itnaa hi nahin, bijepi ne jin netaaon ko tikat die hai, unka ilaake main khaasi pakad samajhi jaati he
 With the help of Naseem Ahmed from Ferozepur, BJP Ferozepur Jhirka assembly seat is considered a very important seat of Mewat and BJP has given ticket to Nasim Ahmed from here
 naseem ahamed ne is seat se 2014 kaa vidhansabha chunaav inelo (INLD) ke tikat par jeeta tha
 Earlier in 2009 too, Nasim Ahmed won from this seat on INLD ticket

 Nasim Ahmed said clearly that the people of Mewat need development and that is why people of every religion have created a mood to support BJP
 lihaaja, yahaan teen talaak yaa mob linching jaisaa mudda nahin he
 Naseem Ahmed looked quite confident on the question whether bjp's lotus will blossom this time in Mewat

 Raje Bhonsle, a farmer from Borkhed village in Beed district of Maharashtra, called us
 raaje do dinon se prime time par bhoomi adhigrahan ko lekar bahes kar rahe the, lekin raaje ko laga ki ek badi kami rah gai he
 There are idealistic claims and criticism about the land acquisition bill, but what the farmer suffers on the land is not being part of it
 haalanki mangalvaar ke prime time main hamane kuch kisaanon ke anubhav shaamil kiye the phir bhi raaje bhonsle kaa vyaktigat anubhav bataata he ki kisaanon ke saath kya ho rahaa he
 So let me tell you the story of Raje
 2003 main borkhed storage tanks ke liye raaje bhonsle kii 12 acre zamin kaa adhigrahan hua
 The land was acquired even before the compensation amount was fixed
 raaje teen saal tak alag alag daftaron ke chakkar lagaate rahe
 Took the officers to the farm at their expense
 tab jaakar 2006 main do vibhaagon ne milakar unki zamin kii naap lee magar keemat tay nahin ho saki
 Meanwhile, 75 percent of the construction of the tank on their land was completed
 saat saal baad yani 2013 main muaavze kii raashi tay ho gai
 Compensation for the land of Raje Bhonsle and other farmers was fixed at Rs 1 crore 9 lakh
 lekin, pataa chalaa ki project ke liye raashi kaa aadha hissaa to tanks banane par kharch ho chukaa he
 So a new file for compensation amount was created and Beed was sent to Aurangabad Small Water Resources Circle office for approval
 vahaan par file aath maheene se ataki padi he
 If Aurangabad Circle Office were also cleared, it would be sent to the Division Office in Pune
 pune se file aurangabad ke jalsandhaaran board ke paas aegi or vahaan se mumbai mantralay jaaegi
 Raje Bhonsle will get compensation when the project amount will come to Beed from the Mumbai Ministry
 phone par baatcheet ke kaaran kuch trutiyaan ho sakati hai lekin aapako bataa den ki bid se aurangabad kii duuri 135 kimi he
 The distance from Aurangabad to Pune is 250 km and since the file will go from Pune to Aurangabad to Mumbai, let OPCO tell that the distance from Aurangabad to Mumbai is 550 km
 10 saal main raaje bhonsle kii file sirf 135 kimi chal saki he
 Now come to Delhi pradhanmantri ne bhoomi adhigrahan par apane varisht sahyogiyon kii ek baithak bulaai
 There were many ministers in this meeting, including Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu
 akali dal or shivasena ke saath alaava sarkaar kii ek or sahyogi lokjanshkti party ne bhi virodh karnaa shuru kar diya
 The Prime Minister has also started the process of calling the opposition parties separately and talking
 sharad pavaar se pradhanmantri kii mulaakaat bhi hui he
 It is clear that the government will not be able to get the bill in the form it wanted but whether the farmers or opposition parties will be satisfied with the new bill that will come
 isi ke saath sarkaar ne yah bhi tay kiya ki vah vipakshi dalon ke prachaar kaa jawaab degi
 For this, Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari brought a copy of the ordinance among journalists and started telling
 vaise yah kaam kendriya gramin vikaas mantri choudhary virendra singh ko karnaa chahie tha jinke mantralay kaa yah bill he
 We have become the habit of journalists to find a deficiency in everything but Nitin Gadkari said on behalf of the government that some points are as follows
 upie sarkaar ne hi 13 act main saamaajik asar ke adhyayan ko nahin rakhaa tha
 We have nothing to do with this
 gadakari ne kaha ki kanoon kii chauthi anusuchee main is adhyayan ko upie ne hataaya, endie ne nahin
 But the finance minister had written in the blog that many projects will take years to complete due to provisions like social impact studies
 isse vikaas kii raftaar kam ho jaaegi
 At that time, we could have also written that we had not removed the UPA
 par khayr
 The government is repeatedly emphasizing that it has not made any compromise on compensation and rehabilitation
 nitin gadakari ne adhyadesh ke 10-e ko padhakar bataaya ki zamin rajya or centre donon kii suchi main aati he
 Gadkari said that as far as the consent is concerned, it depends on the will of the state government
 hamane yah sujhaayaa he ki simavarti ilaake main, raksha utpaadan jaise project ke liye sahmati or saamaajik asar ke adhyayan kii shart kii zarurat nahin hogi
 There will be no need to study consent and social impact to build electricity, roads in the village
 nitin gadakari ne ek udhaaharan se samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki is desh main 80 pratishat bhoomi kaa adhigrahan sinchai yojanaon ke liye hota he
 There is a project of 2000 acres, but up to 3 lakh acres of farmers benefit from the irrigation project
 agar ham 80 fisadi sahmati ke baad 2000 acre zamin kaa adhigrahan karenge to desh ke garib kisaanon ko pani dene ke liye koi project kaise bana sakate hai
 You will also remember the sad story of Raje Bhonsle which you heard earlier
 khayr shaam tak akhilesh sharma ne khabar di ki sarkaar kuch badlaav ke liye taiyaar ho gai he, unke sutron ke mutabik bill ke vivaadaaspad praavdhaanon main sanshodhan kiye jaaenge

 At the same time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan is to directly connect with the beneficiaries about government schemes and policy decisions through the Namo app
 10 karod labhaarthiyon se sidhe judenge modipradhanmantri narendra modi kaa plan kendra sarkaar kii yojanaon ke labhaarthiyon se sidhe baatcheet karne kii he
 According to government figures, the number of people benefited from these schemes is about ten crores

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far addressed the beneficiaries concerned directly about the schemes launched for the Ujjwala scheme, Mudra scheme, start ups, patients and farmers
 sansad ke monsoon satr ke baad namo ap ke zarie sambodhan main or teji aegi aisa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he
 According to Amit Shah's special strategy for Namo App, according to sources, the strategy of BJP President regarding Namo App Mission will work in two ways
 pehla ye ki bhaajapa apane 11 karod sadasyon ko namo ap ke jariye sangathit karegi
 Educate them about government schemes and policy decisions taken by Modi government
 doosraa iske zarie bhaajapa ke samarpit kaaryakarta votaron ko yojanabaddh tareeke se prabhavit karne kaa prayaas karenge or pradhanmantri dwaara hone vaali sidhi baatcheet main shaamil hone ke liye prerit bhi karenge
 It is being said that for this, BJP President Amit Shah has targeted to download one lakh Namo app in every district of the country
 ise padhein: mamata ke kile main shah kii jorajamaaish, target-26 main juty bijepipahali baar matdaan karne vaale yuvaaon par he khaas nazarbhajapa kii ranneeti pehali baar vot dene vaale votaron ko prabhavit karne kii he
 Significantly, in the 2014 general elections, the BJP had a lot of support from the voters of 18-23 years
 yuvaaon kaa ye varg pradhanmantri modi ke takniki prachaar abhiyaan se khaasaa prabhavit hua tha
 For the first time in 2019 elections, the number of voters who will vote for the first time will be around 18 crores

5 million cadets of NCC
 vahiin pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara likhi gai kitaab 'exam Warrior' ke pathakon ko kitaab main die gaye QR code ko scan kar namo ap par pratikriya dene ke liye prerit kiya gaya tha
 The strategy behind this was that the youth who appeared for the twelfth examination would be 18 years old by 2019 and would also be voters in the coming general elections
 fasebuk vivaad ke baad ranneeti main aayaa badlaav2014 ke chunaavon main soshal media (fasebuk, twitor) bhaajapa ke prachaar abhiyaan kaa ahm hissaa the

 New Zealand, which stopped Team India's path in the semi-finals, managed to reach the final for the second time in a row, India had to be eliminated from the semi-finals for the second time in a row
 teesri baar world champion banane ke liye bharat ko ab 2023 kaa intjaar rahegaa
 Team India was considered the strongest contender for this World Cup, but the Indian team's journey ended in the semi-finals
 is world cap main duniya ko nayaa world champion mila
 England captured the World Cup trophy for the first time, defeating the same New Zealand team that bowled India out of the tournament
 kohli ne 2 saal main isisi ke 2 toornament ganvaeviraat kohli ko bhartiya cricket team kii kaman purna rup se 2014 main mili thi
 Kohli was given the responsibility of captaincy after Mahendra Singh Dhoni relinquished the captaincy from the Test team

 This was the first time in ODI history that a team's top-3 batsmen were out on a personal score of 1 run

 In the Serious World Cup, the team India was not looking at the number-4, looking for a face to bat at number-4

 The selectors chose Vijay Shankar, Dinesh Karthik, Lokesh Rahul and Kedar Jadhav

 Everyone knows that losing weight is an extremely difficult task
 sharir ko sahi shape main laane ke liye bahut mehnat kerani padati he
 People follow different types of diet to lose weight
 ghanton gym main pasinaa bahaate hai, lekin phir bhi vajan kam nahin hota he
 If this happens to you too, do not ignore it, because it may be due to some health problem
 1
 Thyroid - The small glands in your throat produce thyroid hormone
 khaane se milane vaale iodine kaa istemaal kar ke thyroid gland do alag tarah ke hormone banaate hai
 When the thyroid gland produces very small amounts of hormones, it causes weight gain
 vahiin, thyroid ke sahi tareeke se kaam na karne par metabolism kamjor padhane lagata he
 2
 tanaav-tanaav or motaape kaa bahut gaharaa sambandh he
 This fact has been proved in many study reports
 jab vyakti tanaav main hota he to sharir cortisol hormone produs karata he, jisase blad sugar kaa str kaaphi bad jaataa he
 Fat starts accumulating on the stomach when a high amount of cortisol hormone is produced
 vahiin, kuch log tanaav main zyada khaane lagate hai, jo vajan badhaane kaa kaam karata he
 3
 insulin main rukaawat-ham jo bhi khate hai, wo glucose main brake ho jaataa he
 This increases the level of blood sugar significantly
 pankriyaaj sharir main glucose ke milane par insulin hormone produs karata he
 When insulin functions normally, it transports glucose to the liver, muscles, and other parts
 lekin agar aap insulin pratirodhi hai, to aapke insulin receptors insulin ko pahchaan nahin pate hai
 This causes the body's energy to accumulate in the form of obesity, which leads to weight gain
 4
 Lack of sleep - 7 to 8 hours of sleep is very important to stay healthy
 sahi dhang se neend na lene se sharir motaape kii chapet main aa jaataa he
 It has been confirmed in several studies that poor sleep can cause obesity

 Actor Saif Ali Khan, who has been in the film industry for the last 25 years, has always entertained the audience with his films
 saf jald hi film 'phantum' main najar aane vaale hai
 Saif's film is based on 26 \ 11 attacks
 film main saf ek army officer ke role main najar aane vaale hai
 When our team talked to Saif, he told many interesting things about the film
 film kaa naam 'phantum' kyon rakhaa gaya he?'phantum' ek ection film kaa acha tital he
 a man whom no one knows much about, is of a mystery type whose death will not matter to anyone
 yah ek mishan par gaya hua insaan he jise 'phantum' kaha jaataa he
 The film is based on the novel by Hussain Zaidi, have you read that book? i have not read it because Kabir Khan said don't read, the screenplay is a bit different
 lekin kitaab kii kahani ke bare main mujhe kaaphi kuch pataa he
 What are you doing in the film? There is an action film, there is a feeling of patriotism, people who attacked 26 / 11 will be seen in the film trying to punish those attackers
 aapaki film 'agent vinod' film naa chal paane kaa kya kaaran tha?hamane banaai to thi lekin wo chal nahin pai, shaayad hamane sahi film nahin banaai thi
 But this time is quite different from Kabir Khan's film 'agent Vinod'
 aap bas yah kah sakate hai kii 'phantum' ke liye 'agent vinod' meraa ek reharsal tha
 Did you also give your opinion to the director during the shoot? No, Kabir is a very good filmmaker and i definitely listen to the director
 kabir kii bajrangi bhaijan ne acchhee kamai kii, kya aapako lagata he kii is film ke saath bhi ab darshakon kii ummiden bad gayi hai?ji log agar kabir kii film dekhne aaen to ye hamaare liye bhi kaaphi badi baat hogi
 Every film has its fate, 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' is a positive type of film
 phantum film 'bajrangi bhaijan' se kaaphi alag he, ek hi diarector ne donon filmein banaayi he lekin treetment alag he
 Do you think Muslims are unsafe in India? i don't know, i think we all should respect each other's religion, if we find it difficult to adopt, then at least respect it
 salmaan ne kuch twitor par coment kiya tha, uske baad unhen maafee maangani padi thi?ji, ham sabko bolne kii swatantraaa milani chahie, agar twitor par likhakar maafee maangani pade to phir phayda kya he, twitor sirf news failaane ke liye hona chahie
 Nowadays, people themselves become news
 safalataa or asafalataa ko kaise dekhte hai?mujhe lagata he kii 25 saal se ham log kaam karte aa rahe hai, kabhi-kabhi galat chizon par dhyaan chalaa jaataa he, to abhi mujhe dhyaan dena chahie ki kis tarah kii film kerani he
 You have also done experiments with different films like 'go Goa Gone' and 'happy Ending'
 ek vakt tha jab ham production main kuch bhi bana sakate the jaise 'lav aajkal,' 'cocktail,' lekin ham chaahate hai ki ab or acchhee filmein banaaen
 After watching 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' i have thought how important a hero's character can be
 mujhe kabhi-kabhi lagata he ki meri soch kaaphi western he
 But now i should think differently and do something different
 mujhe lagata he ki ek achche diarector ke saath kaam karnaa chahie
 Don't do comedy films? i would definitely like to work in a good comedy film
 katrina ke saath kaam karnaa kaisaa rahaa?wo sabhi chizon main kaaphi intrest leti hai
 Like she was planning a lot before going to the reality show
 mehnat karti hai or acchhee hai
 The film is said to be like 'D Day' and 'baby'
 yah film anokhi he, ek vishay par kai kahaniyaan dikhaai ja sakati hai
 By the way, 'D Day' and 'baby' are both separate films
 saf or akshay kumaar saath-saath kab dikhenge?acchhee script ho to jarur aaenge
 Both are engaged in their work

 ) bollywood actress shraddha kapur ne saal 2010 main industry main teen pattee film se kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 But Shraddha got recognition from Aashiqui 2
 ab shraddha kapur bahubali fame prabhas ke saath saaho film main najar aane vaali hai
 Saaho is releasing on 30 August this month
 shraddha kapur ne apane 9 saal ke kariyar main takreeban 17 filmein kii hai
 Shraddha has also become a part of three major projects during this period
 lekin itane bade projects karne ke baavjood shraddha kapur top actraces kii list main shaamil nahin hai
 There are many reasons for this
 # 1
 Actually, Shraddha Kapoor has done many films so far that she became a hit, but Shraddha did not get her credit
 jaise- haidar, baagi, stri
 These are three such big films which earned accolades at the box office
 in filmon kii safalataa kaa puraa shrey hero bator le gaye
 In Haider, Shraddha Kapoor was subdued in front of Shahid Kapoor and Tabu's work
 jabaki baagi main tiger shroff kaa dance or ection shraddha par bahut baari padaa
 Shraddha Kapoor got the lead in the woman, but all the magic was taken by Rajkumar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi
 jo bachaa khuchaa use shraddha ne aparshakti khurana ke saath saajha kiya
 Shraddha is now opposite of Prabhas in Saaho, a star beyond which it will not be easy to make Shraddha a place
 haalanki ab tak ke tiger, trailor main shraddha kaa kirdaar damdaar najar aa rahaa he
 # 2
 dance main number 1, acting main jiroshraddha kapur ne kai dance besd filmon main kaam kiya he
 These include ABCD 2
 kai filmein dance besd nahin bhi to shraddha ke dance number hit rahe
 Shraddha is a brilliant dancer, there are no two opinions about it
 unki aane vaali film street dancer he
 But in the case of acting, Shraddha could not be more amazing
 unki filmon main chhap chhod dene vaali adaakaari kam hi najar ai he
 # 3
 kirdaaron ke saath prayogshraddha kapur ne ab tak kii filmon main kirdaar ke saath koi khaas prayog nahin kiye hai
 Yes, one of his films "haseena Parkar" did come, in which Shraddha Kapoor tried to play the lead character of the female gangster
 magar is kirdaar ko shraddha kapur ko parde par dho nahin pain
 Viewers also dismissed Hasina Parkar badly
 lihaaja ye film box offis par super flop sabit hui
 Critics also said that Shraddha Kapoor acted in the film over
 ab shraddha kapur apane kariyar main saaho ke rup main sabase bade bajet kii film karne ja rahi hai
 It will be seen what kind of film proves to be in Saaho Shraddha Kapoor's career
 actress ko iskaa phayda miltaa bhi he yaa nahin
 The two leaders jointly addressed the reporters after meeting US President Barack Obama in Washington
 is avasar par obama ne pradhanmantri kaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki bharat duniya kii ubhartee takat he

 obama ne yah bhi kaha ki bharat ek jimmedaar desh he or america uskaa sabase acha dost he
 He said that America stands with India on the issue of terrorism
 donon netaaon ne ummid jataai kii bharat-america sahyog nirantar aage badhegaa

 unhone obama ko parivaar samet bharat aane kaa nyotaa bhi diya
 Manmohan Singh said that America and India together will fight global warming

 This is the first time BJP has made tremendous inroads in West Bengal
 iske pehle lambey samay se yahaan par vamadalon or trinmul congress kaa paracham laharaata rahaa he
 Since 2011, West Bengal has been the stronghold of Mamata Banerjee and the BJP had never managed to get a double digit seat here
 is baar pashchim bengal ko bijepi bahut tavajjo de rahi thi or isiilie piem narendra modi ne uttar pradesh ke baad yahaan par sabase zyada reliyaan kin
 India Today Data Intelligence Unit analyzed the data for the Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal and found that the BJP performed well in West Bengal, but out of the 9 seats which were voted in the seventh and final phase, BJP did not have a single seat Could win bijepi kii charan-waar badhatpaschim bengal main chhathwein charan tak bijepi har charan main kam se kam do siten jeetin
 The BJP won all seats in the first and second phases, winning two out of five seats in the third phase
 is charan main do siten trinmul congress ko or ek seat congress ko milin
 In the fourth phase, BJP won 3 and Trinamool won 4 seats, while Congress got one
 paanchaven charan main bhi bijepi ne 3 siten jeetin, jabaki trinmul ne 4 siten jeetin
 The election campaign during the sixth phase became quite tense and BJP got five out of 8 seats in this phase, while Trinamool got only three seats in this phase, but in the seventh phase West Bengal had 9 seats and all the seats Trinamool won
 bijepi ko antim charan main rajya se ek bhi seat nahin mili
 In these 9 seats, excluding Dum Dum Lok Sabha seat, the difference of victory in all the seats was at least one lakh
 damdam main jeet kaa antar 52,000 vot rahaa
 West Bengal had 9 seats - Basirhat, Diamond Harbor, Jayanagar, Jadavpur, Mathurapura, Kolkata North, Kolkata South, Barsaat and Dum Dum in the last phase of polling
 dilachasp yah he ki 2014 main in sabhi 9 siton par bijepi tisare sthaan par thi or is baar sabhi par duusare sthaan par rahi
 However, its vote share increased almost twice as much as the previous time
 saatven charan main kya hua?sanyog se saatven charan main in 9 siton par matdaan ke ek hafte pehle pashchim bengal main hinsa hui
 In North Kolkata, there was a clash between BJP workers and Trinamool activists and the statue of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was broken in the college
 yah tab hua jab bijepi adhyaksh amit shah uttari kolkata ke ek hisse main raily kar rahe the
 After the violence erupted during the rally, some elements broke the idol of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar in Vidyasagar College, a century old
 haalanki, unki ab tak pahchaan nahin ja saki he, lekin murti tuutane ke baad is masale par khub bavaal hua
 Social reformer and educationist Vidyasagar Bhadra is part of the Bengali culture's educational past
 murti jisane bhi todi ho, lekin is vajah se logon main is ghatana ke prati gussa jaahir tha
 Seeing the importance of Vidyasagar, both parties tried to control damage and charged each other fiercely
 trinmul congress ne chunaav ayog ko kuch 'saboot' dekar kaha ki murti todane ke peeche bijepi kaaryakarta the, vahiin piem modi ne hinsa or todphod ke liye trinmul kaaryakartaaon ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 PM Modi himself promised that where the statue of Vidyasagar has been demolished, he will get the statue of Vidyasagar installed there
 agar voting pattern dekha jaae to kolkata shahar se lagi teen mahatvapurn siten bijepi haar gai, kyonki bahut se logon ne party ko vot nahin die
 Mamta Banerjee said, 'this attack and oppression of my state will not go waste, its punishment will be met
 main har cheez par nigaah rakh rahi hum
 i will change one inch
 'kolkata uttar, kolkata dakshin or jadhavpur dakshin bengal kii shahari siten hai, jahaan par trinmul congress kii majboot upasthiti he
 On the basis of voting, the BJP has lost more than one lakh votes in these three seats
 sirf jadhavpur seat hi trinmul ne 3 lakh voton ke antar se jeet lee
 In these three seats, the Trinamool Congress got more votes than in 2014
 kolkata dakshin seat par is baar 1,55,192 voton kii badhat hasil hui, jabaki pichley chunaav main 1,36,338 voton se jeet mili thi
 Similarly, Sudip Bandopadhyay of Trinamool won the Kolkata North seat by 1,27,095 votes, while in the last election, Trinamool won this seat by 96,226 votes
 jadhavpur seat par is baar trinmul ko 2,95,139 voton se baari jeet hasil hui thi, jabaki 2014 main jeet kaa antar 1,25,203 tha
 The demolition of the Vidyasagar statue was immediately made an emotional issue by Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and projected the BJP as an external party not familiar with the sensibilities of Bengal
 chunaav nateezon ke aankadon par nigaah daalane par aisa dikhataa he ki vidyasagar kii murti tode jane ke baad mamata banerjee ne bengali card khelaa or matadaataaon ne vot na dekar bijepi ko iskaa dand diya

 That is, 6 out of every 10 phones sold are from Chinese companies

 Fall of Indian companies: In 2014, Indian companies accounted for 49% of the country's smartphone market
 yah vah daur tha jab micromax, lava, carbon, or index jaise brands graahakon kii pasand hote the
 Then why did Indian companies lose their luster? Hariom Rai, chairman and managing director of Lava International, says, "there were three major reasons behind the decline of Indian companies
 '' unke mutabik, pehali yah ki 2016 main hui notebandi ke kaaran puure smartphone bazaar ko tagada jhatka laga
 According to an estimate, it has closed more than 60 thousand shops across the country

 Second, the arrival of Chinese companies in India with e-commerce
 shyaomi ne bhartiya bazaar main online plateform ke raste pakad banaai
 The company began to increase its market share without worrying about losses

 It was difficult for Indian companies standing on their feet in front of these companies
 counter point research ke senior analist (divises and echosystem) pavel naiya kehete hai, ''jeeyo kii entry bhi smartphone bazaar main bhartiya companiyon ke pichhadgaye kaa ek kaaran rahaa
 "many low end smartphone users adopted Jio due to attractive data offers and good features at low prices, which shocked Indian companies selling cheap smartphones
" naiya kehete hai, ''miderange or hai and smartphone segment main lagaataar product na aane ke kaaran bhartiya companiyaan is bazaar se apni hissedari khoti gayi

 The government claims that all these created a total of 6 lakh jobs

 "the production capacity will double after the start of this plant, which will also help meet the company's export demand," says Marya
 The company's existing plant is spread over about 50 acres, where other than assembling Tools are also made
 vivo ke alaava samsung, shyaomi jaisi videshi companiyaan bhi bhartiya bazaar main nivesh badha rahi hai
 On 19 February, the Cabinet approved the new National Eletronics Policy

 These factories claimed to have created 6 lakh jobs in the country, so more jobs were lost to demonetisation and e-commerce
 aise main, india cellular and electronics association ke chairman pankaj mohindro kehete hai, ''quality or fitures ke maamle main bhartiya companiyaan global companiyon ko takkar dene main samarth hai
 There is a need to make them hold in the low range smartphone and feature phone market
 '' badi chinis companiyaan feechar phone market main nahin hai
 Also their products are expensive
 aise main bhartiya companiyon ke liye kam range ke bazaar main acchhee sambhaavnaaen hai
 By the way, Jio has 40% share in the feature phone market of India
 vahiin, samsung 12 fisadi kii hissedari ke saath duusare sthaan par he
 Feature phones and smartphones account for about 50 per cent of the mobile phone market
 valuation ke hisaab se feechar phone bazaar 300 karod ru
 Belongs to agle 3 se 4 chaar saal tak feechar phone kii maang majubat rahane kii sambhaavna he
 The most important thing is that Indian companies need financial help from the government to compete with big companies like Chinese
 hariom raay kehete hai, ''duniya main aaj jo companiyaan raaj kar rahi hai, shuruaati varshon main ve bhi ghate main thim
 If they did not get help, today they would not be on the heights
 '' unke mutabik, sarkaar ko chahie ki ve bhartiya companiyon ko 'champion company' banane main unki madad kare taaki ve na sirf bhartiya balki vaishvik bazaar main bhi apni pakad bana saken
 Clearly, Indian companies need support to fight foreign brands that have an annual turnover equivalent to India's total mobile phone market

 ' After Amit Shah became Union Home Minister, discussions started on the new president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and it came to a halt on Monday when former Union Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda was appointed as the acting president of the party
 Has been announced dilli main bijepi sansadeey board kii baithak main liye faisle ke bare main bataate hue raksha mantri or party ke varisht netaa rajnath singh ne kaha ki nadda bijepi ke kaaryakari adhyaksh honge
 Meanwhile, Amit Shah will continue to be the party president
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mantrimandal main amit shah ke shaamil hone ke baad jepi nadda ko party kii kaman saunpi gai he
 It is believed that Amit Shah will remain the party's national president for the next 6 months
 amit shah ke saath milakar hi jepi nadda bataur kaaryakari adhyaksh party kaa kaamkaaj sanbhaalenge
 Amit Shah is unlikely to pay much attention to the party due to important portfolios like Home Ministry
 aise main nadda hi party ke mukhya kartadharta rahenge, haalanki amit shah abhi adhyaksh pad par kabiz hai or har faisle par unki najar rahegi
 Jai Prakash Nadda, who comes from a lesser state like Himachal Pradesh, will be very challenging to work for the post of executive chairman, even if he works as the head of the party even for the next 6 months, the challenges will be no less
 Will be
 amit shah kii vishalkay chhaviamit shah ne apane kaarykaal main bijepi ko jis mukaam par pahunchaaya use banaae rakhana agle adhyaksh ke liye chunauti bharaa rahegaa
 JP Nadda has just been made the executive chairman, but he has to present himself as a strong and powerful president along with keeping the party at the top
 sabhi kii najar is par rahegi ki vah is makasad main kitna kaamyaab ho pate hai
 It is challenging for Nadda to maintain the kind of bumper success that BJP got during the time of Speaker Amit Shah during the assembly elections in 4 states
 unke kaaryakari adhyaksh ke kaarykaal (agle 6-7 maheene) main kam se kam 5 rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Out of these, there are 3 states except Delhi where BJP itself is in power and it will be challenged to win the election in the midst of anti-incumbency
 ye 3 rajya hai maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand
 In Haryana, the term of the Assembly is ending in October, then in Maharashtra in November
 jabaki jharkhand main 5 janvari ko kaarykaal samaapt ho rahaa he
 Nadda has to maintain the bjp's power in these three states
 iske alaava jammu-kashmir main bhi vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 Right now there is President's rule and elections are to be held there in the next few months and the party will also have the responsibility of winning a big victory
 dilli main arvind kejariwal se chunautidilli vidhansabha kaa chunaav bhi agle saal kii shuruyaat main hone vaala he
 The term of the Legislative Assembly ends on February 22, 2020
 dilli main is samay aam aadmi party satta main he or usne pichley vidhansabha chunaav main aitihaasik jeet hasil karte hue duusari baar satta par kabiz hui thi
 BJP had tried to return to power the last time, but the Aam Aadmi Party under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal broke the bjp's dream
 haalanki pichley maheene khatm hue loksabhaa chunaav main aap party kaa jo pradarshan rahaa usase bijepi behad utsahit hogi kyonki usne sabhi saaton kii saaton seat par kabja jamaa liya
 Although the same thing happened in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but after the assembly elections came a few months later, BJP could get only 3 out of 70 seats
 shesh 67 siton par aam aadmi party vijayi rahi thi
 This time too, the BJP is in full swing by winning all the seven seats, but in front of the new working president, it will have to ensure that the situation like 2015 assembly elections in 2020 does not happen
 yah bhi tay he ki vidhansabha chunaav main kejariwal ko chunauti dena aasaan nahin hoga or iske liye kavayad abhi se shuru kar deni hogi
 Challenges to keep Shiv Sena together: Shiv Sena, which maintains rebellion till the Lok Sabha elections, decided to contest with BJP and its decision seems right after seeing the results of other opposition parties, but in such a situation the existence of Shiv Sena is threatened
 Starts looming
 narendra modi ke duusari baar pradhanmantri pad kii shapaksh lene ke kuch hi din main party supremeo uddhav thakare kaa ayodhya janaa dikhaata he ki shivasena apane astitv ke liye jaddojahad jari rakhegi
 While it is also true that the BJP is in power this time too, it will be a big challenge to retain the NDA in front of Nadda as Shiv Sena is the second largest party after BJP
 bihar main jediu se dostimaharashtra kii tarah bihar main janata dal united (jediu) ke saath satta par kabiz bijepi ke saamne gathbandhan ko banaae rakhane kii chunauti he
 In Bihar, the NDA has won the Lok Sabha elections strongly
 ab kai morchon par nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ko aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 In the 2015 assembly elections, Nitish Kumar of JDU contested with RJD and Congress and won under the grand alliance, but later Nitish broke Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD ties and again with BJP new government Made it
 rajya main agle dedh saal main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai or yahaan par bhi nadda ke saamne endie ghatak dalon ko saath banaae rakhane kii chunauti rahegi
 New strategy for South India: The BJP was hopeful that this time in the Lok Sabha elections, apart from Karnataka, it will get some seats from other states of South India, but in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala, the bjp's position was quite bad
 andhra or kerala samet tamilnadu main bijepi ko ek bhi seat nahin mili
 The BJP had tried hard to win in these states, but disappointment went hand in hand
 ab nadda ke saamne dakshin main seat jeetne ke liye nae sire se ranneeti banani hogi
 Responsibility to rein in big leaders: After Amit Shah became Home Minister, JP Nadda, who became executive chairman, will also have a big challenge in how he can control many of his big leaders
 giriraaj singh, sadhvi pragna or sakshi maharaj jaise netaa aksar apane bayanon ko lekar party ko sankat main daalate rahe hai
 Recently, after Giriraj's remarks about Iftar, Amit Shah reprimanded him and also advised him to keep control

 Bypassing the politics related to land pooling in Delhi, many real estate experts believe that land pooling can transform Delhi
 har roj badhati anothrise dilli ke peeche sabase badi vajah yahaan afordable houseing kii kami he or land pooling dilli kii is kami ko bakhubi puraa kar sakati he
 One and a half lakh acres of land will be available
 According to an estimate of DDA, about 1
5 lakh acres of land will be available from Dwarka to Narela after land pooling
 sutron kii maane to agle do se teen maheene main yahaan kaam shuru bhi ho jayega, kyonki didie ne apane str par tamaam taiyaari do saal pehle hi puri kar lee thi
 Land pooling was on the table of the Delhi government for the last two years
 baharhaal, 89 gaanvon ko shahrikrut ilaaka ghoshit karte hi ab is par kaam kaaphi teji se hoga
 Let us tell you that about 115 villages have already been declared urbanized by the DDA
 is tarah yojana main kul 200 gaanvon ke gramin ilaake shaamil honge, jahaan tak is ilaake main flats lene kaa sawaal he to aapako bataa den ki yahaan maujuud privet bilderon ne to do saal pehle se hi ofer-plan dene shuru kar die the
 The politics of taking credit too Shabab Paramai In 2015 itself, the Ministry of Urban Development had completed the file related to land pooling and it was seen as a revolutionary change in the area of land acquisition across the country, after which forced land acquisition Will not be required, but the owner of the land himself would like to be a part of it
 beete do saalon main land pooling kii file arvind kejariwal kii mej par ataki rahi
 For some reason or the other, the Delhi government did not notify it
 ye baat digar he ki notification paas karte hi kejariwal ne sabase pehle road sho kar kisaanon ko vikaas karaane kaa shrey luutane kii koshish kii
 Leader of Opposition in Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijendra Gupta says that the people of Delhi know everything, Kejriwal does not do anything at first, just plays the drum to take credit
 jaahir he, bijepi or aam aadmi party ke bich land pooling ko lekar aage bhi raajnneeti kam nahin hone vaali kyonki land pooling bade paimaane par ek game changing plan sabit hone vaala he
 Small farmers / landowners will be a total of two categories in deficit meandland pooling, the first category will consist of individuals or groups with more than 20 hectares of land and the second category with 2 to 20 hectares of land
 pehali shrenee main didie 40 fisadi jameen khud rakhega or 60 fisadi lautaa degaa or duusari shrenee main 48 fisadi jameen lautaai jaaegi or baaki jameen didie apane paas rakhega
 It is clear that small and medium farmers or landowners falling in the second category will be victims of this disparity in the rules
 is bare main kuch kisaanon ne arvind kejariwal ko likhit shikaayat bhi di he lekin jameen dilli sarkaar kaa masalaa nahin he, lihaaja wo kuch kar bhi nahin sakate
 However, it is believed that at least 2
5 million families will be able to get home in the development wave that will flow on the land gathered after land pooling

 On the set, strict instructions are in the role of director Manish Sharma in the film Shahrukhlid and in the picture you can also see Shah Rukh Khan's mobile, which has SRK slip on it
 mjedaar baat yah he ki ye photo fain film ke twitor pej par pichley saal share kii gai thi
 Where the phone is stacked, it is clearly written that mobile phones and ipads are not allowed on the set

 Questions are being raised on law and order in UP
 taaja maamle main khud mukhyamantri ke shahar gorakhpur main ek nami doctor se jaan ke badale 20 lakh rupee kii rangadari maangane kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 He is the same doctor, whose hospital was inaugurated by CM Yogi himself on 14 June
 maamla gorakhpur ke nami sarjan doctor es
 s
 shahi se judaa he
 Doctorshi says that on June 28 and 29, he was called by phone asking for extortion of 20 lakh rupees and threatening to shoot if he did not pay extortion money
 pehle ve maamle ko halke main lete rahe lekin do teen baar dhamkee bhari kol aane ke baad unhone maamle kii shikaayat jile ke esaspi se kii
 The matter was stirred to the notice of the police
 kyonki doctor shahi ke soobe ke mukhyamantri yogi se achche sambandh hai
 Even CM Yogi inaugurated this hospital of Doctor Shahi last month
 police ne is sambandh main fouran maamla darj kar karrwai shuru kar di he
 Doctor S

 According to Shahi, he was also threatened by a prisoner detained in Deoria Jail for killing 20 lakh rupees and not giving money
 is ghatana ke baad police vibhaag ne doctor shahi ko suraksha pradaan karte hue do hathiyaarband sipaahi unke saath tainaat kar die hai
 The police is now investigating the entire case

 The police is not ready to give much information about this
 bhrashtachar ko lekar ek or aatishbaajee shuru ho chuki he
 This is the sixth-seventh political wrestling on scandals in the last five-six years, which is fought with full fervor and ammunition every time and gives the political group an opportunity to dampen its faith
 lekin hakeekat yah he ki bhrashtachar ko lekar ham ek chalaave ke daur main pravesh kar chuke hai, jisamen bhrashtachar se nirnaayak mukti kii ummid lagaae, ek mulk ko rajnatik kushtiyon kaa tamashbin banaakar rakh diya gaya he
 India is at the top of all the scales of corruption, but we are the last among the 175 countries that signed the United Nations anti-corruption Treaty in 2003 in order to deal with it, establish institutions and a transparent framework
 hamase to aage pakistan, malaysia, indonesia, bhutan or vietnam jaise desh hai jinke prayaas, safaltaaen-vifaltaaen bhrashtachar par global charchaaon main jagah pate hai
 On the pretext of Choppergate, we can pay tribute to those movements and restless people who churned the country between 2011 and 2013
 lagata tha ki jaise bharat main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf inkulab aa gaya he
 One can tell where the Lokpal came out of this very turbulent phase, whose law is technically in force since January 2014, but the Lokpal sir did not appear
 yah khabar kisi akhbaar yaa tivi ke matlab kii nahin thi ki disambar, 2014 main modi sarkaar ne lokapal kanoon ko punahvichaar or sanshodhano ke liye kanoon mantralay kii sansadeey samiti ko saunp diya
 a year later, in December 2015, the committee submitted its report to the government with a recommendation to bring the Central Vigilance Commission and the anti-corruption Wing of CBI under the purview of Lokpal
 bhrashtachar ko lekar yah kisi vachanabaddhata he ki takneekee taur par lokapal kanoon bane dhai saal ho chuke hai, lekin modi sarkaar lokapal par kuch nahin boli
 According to the treaty of the United Nations, India also has to make five other laws
 inamen ek vislabloar bill bhi he
 Under this law, the government has made its intention tainted by loosening the provision of protection of those who raise voice against corruption
 yah vidheyak rajyasabha main atka he
 Judicial Accountability Bill for transparency in courts, Citizen's Charter and Grievance Redressal Bill for rights related to civil services, Bill to amend the Prevention of Corruption Act to curb corruption in government services and Bills to stop bribery in foreign officials and international organizations
 In the last two years, there was no activism in the government
 kisi ko yah mugalata nahin he ki lokapal yaa in paanch kanoonon ke jariye ham bharat kii siyasat or kaarysamskruti main bhide bhrashtachar ko roak sakenge
 This is just an attempt to create an initial framework for stopping corruption, investigation and transparency, that too has not started
 2003 main bhrashtachar par antarrashtriya sandhi (2005 se lagu) ke baad lagbhag prayek desh ne apni paristhiti ke aadhaar par bhrashtachar se nibatane ke liye ranneetiyaan, sansthaaen, niyam, kanoon or agenciyaan banaai hai, jinhen lagaataar sanshodhit kar prabhavi banaaya ja rahaa he
 Over the years, UNDP and Transparency International have studied anti-corruption strategies, which reveal stories of both defeat and victory in this complex war

 China is conducting the world's most rigorous anti-corruption campaign, in which more than two lakh officials and members of the Communist Party have been investigated since 2013 and the prosecution rate is 99 percent
 bhrashtachar rokane kii ranneetiyaan chaar buniyadi aadhaaron par tiki hai
 The first is a strong and independent monitoring agency; the second is the regular and transparent exposure to corruption, while the third aspect is adequate resources for investigation and detailed technical capabilities; and the fourth is clear law and active courts to give fast verdict on corruption
 bharat kii taraf dekhie
 We do not have any of these four
 bharat kii ek taqatvar swatantra agency banane (lokapal) kii jaddojahad ab tak jari he
 The Central Vigilance Commission got statutory status in 2003, 39 years after its formation but not the right to investigate
 jaanch karne vaali sibiai sarkaron ke pinjre kaa tota he
 There has never been a mechanism for measuring corruption and the courts are not equipped with laws that can bind complex corruption
 keechad sani congress se to is sabaki ummid bhi nahin thi, lekin bhrashtachar ke khilaaf janadesh par baithkar satta main ai modi sarkaar se yah apeksha jarur thi ki vah puraane ghotaalon kii tej jaanch karegi or bharat ko bhrashtachar se nibatane ke liye doorgaami va sthaayee ranneeti or sansthaaen degi
 agustawestland brokers know that a decade will go by connecting the wires of bribery spread in different countries of the world
 siyasat ko bhi pataa he ki jaanch main kuch na hone kaa, kyonki unhone bhrashtachar se nibatane ko lekar sansthagat taur par kuch kiya hi nahin he
 They are just fond of plunging into the mire of politics, whose season ends after some time
 dilli se sate gurugram main do yuvakon kaa apharan kar berahami se hatya kaa sansanikhej maamla saamne aayaa he
 The police have also solved the mystery of the murder

 According to police, the four persons accused of murder are friends of both the dead
 doston ke bich jatisuchak shabd ko lekar shuru hue jhagade main chaar doston ne milakar apane hi do doston kii berahami se hatya kar di
 The revelation of this incident in the police investigation is shocking
 police ke mutabik, hatya ke aarope main jin do yuvakon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he, unki pahchaan gadoli nivasee rohit or vinay ke rup main hui he
 Police have recovered the bodies of the dead at the behest of the arrested accused
 aropiyon ne gadoli main reliance company kii khaali pade janglenuma ilaake main donon mritkon ke shavon ko dafna diya tha
 According to the police, the victims were first attacked with an ax and then tried to burn them
 police ne bataaya ki jis kamare main donon yuvakon kii hatya kii gai, vahaan chaaron ore saamaan bikharaa hua tha, idhar-udhar sharaab ke gilaas gire pade the or deevaaron par khun chhinte pade hue the
 During interrogation of the police, both the accused told that late on December 20-21, 6 friends sat in the same room and drank
 iske baad chaar doston ne milakar mritak rahul or krishna kojatisuchak shabdonke jariye jaleel karnaa shuru kiya
 This triggered a quarrel between friends

 After this, he also tried to burn the dead bodies by putting petrol

 The four accused immediately escaped from the scene after committing the crime

 - Input IANS nehwal dampati kaa sapana saakaar hone main 12 varsh lag gaye
 Harvir Singh Nehwal, an insect specialist at the Haryana Agricultural University in Hisar, went to the Directorate of Oilseeds Research of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in Hyderabad, with the same dream that both of his daughters would earn a name as a player
 aakhir ve or unki patni ushaa, ek gruhinee, achche badminton khilaadi the
 The younger daughter showed interest but not in judo and karate, in which she was admitted in 1998
 aath varshiya cyna ne badminton kaa racket pakadaney kaa faisla kiya
 From the very next year, Nehwal took him to Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, located in the middle of Hyderabad, 20 km away from his scooter or bus so that Andhra Pradesh Sports Authority (SAAP) coach PSS Nani Prasad could be trained
 prasad kaa kahana he, ''uske aseemit utsaah se lagata tha ki vah seekhney ko taiyaar he or fouran sikh gai
 When SAAP decided to shift its badminton academy to Vijayawada, the determined father took Saina to the Sports Authority of India in Hyderabad and Saina was the national coach S
 for the next four years

 Arif was under surveillance
 jab pulela gopichand ne 2004 main gopichand badminton academy shuru kii tab nehwal ne apni beti ko purv england champion kii nigaraanee main daalane main vakt nahin ganvaaya
 Ironically, Saina was noticed by Gopichand only when both were undergoing training under Arif
 pita ne cyna ko saamaanya bacchon kii ichchhaaon-hafte main ek baar icecream kha sakati hai or film dekhne shaayad hi kabhi jaati hai-se vanchit kar yah sunishchit kar diya ki ve apni kamyaabi ke aade aane vaali chizon par dhyaan na den
 It is the dedication of the girl that on her return to Hyderabad after the victory, she returned to the Academy for training again from her Honda City the next morning of the grand reception
 gopichand kaa kahana he, ''khel ke liye uski bhukh kabhi khatm nahin hoti
 "he never complained about his tiring routine
" isaki vajah se unhen apni aupchaarik shiksha chhodani padi haalanki unhen shahar ke saint ans college main daakhila mil gaya
 Proud father says, "because of his recent victory, my daughter Chandrashanu recently asked me why i did not make him a badminton player
 '' chandranshu philhal gudgaanv main rahakar emb kar rahi hai or apni mashhoor bahan kaa swaagat karne ke liye hyderabad ai thim

 Because the court has ordered to register an FIR against them

 Nirmal Baba, who used to show devout dreams to devotees with his prescriptions, has reached the law
 lakhanu kii sijeem adaalat ne police ko aadesh diya he ki wo nirmal baba ke khilaaf exiaar darj kare
 The court has given this order on the plea of two children Aditya Thakur and Tanya Thakur
 in bacchon ne 10 april ko lakhanu ke gomti nagar thane main nirmal baba ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai thi
 The 16-year-old Tanya Thakur from Lucknow and 13-year-old Aditya Thakur allege that Nirmal Baba tells his devotees prescriptions that have no scientific basis
 baba ke bhakt bhale hi in nuskhon se prabhavit hote hon, aditya or tanya ne thane main likhit shikaayat di ki nirmal baba sidhe-sidhe desh ke lakhon logon ko dharm kaa bhay dikhaakar, apni juthi mahatta dikhaakar or logon ko bevakoof banaakar apana ullu sidhaa kar rahe hai
 Such antics are giving a huge boost to superstition, progressive ideas are being pushed back and completely cheated
 police ne is maamle main shikaayat to darj kar lee, lekin bacchon ko thagi kaa shikaar maanane se inkaar kar diya or dhokhadhadi kaa cese darj nahin kiya
 Children approached the court against this

 With the arrest of Chidambaram, the news has now intensified that will Chidambaram get caught in the legal bets and CBI screws? The situation is such that Chidambaram reaches Tihar on Friday evening itself
 vahiin ghabaraae hue chidambaram ke diggaj vakeelon ne to chidambaram ko sibiai hiraasat main rakhane kii peshkash tak supreme court main kar daali, lekin phir bhi hasil kuch nahin hua
 An army of big lawyers made every effort to get Chidambaram out of the CBI and ed's lawsuits and jail
 vahiin desh kii badi jaanch agenciyaan bhi kisi maamle main kam najar nahin aa rahi hai
 Every wager of Chidambaram's lawyers is being cut off from other legal gimmicks
 yani siyaasi shatranj par kanoonee moharon se shah maat kaa khel jari he
 In the Supreme Court, Chidambaram's lawyer Kapil Sibal was strongly opposed to the arrest of Chidambaram in the special court
 ab vahiin supreme court ke aage gidgidaate dikhe ki somvaar tak unako sibiai kii hiraasat main hi rahane diya jaae or ve iske liye khushi khushi taiyaar hai
 In the special court, when CBI asked for five more days of custody, Sibal and Singhvi were lying as if they were there
 unhone kaha, 'maai lord koi jarurat nahin he ab hiraasat kii
 Our clients are being asked the same questions again and again
 unako sirf nicha dikhaane kii garaj se sibiai hiraasat main lenaa chaahati he
 But the question is that what happened after three days that Sibal is insisting that Hazur be allowed to remain in CBI custody for four more days
 ham iske liye bhi raji hai
 However, CBI and ED counsel Solicitor General Tushar Mehta should have been happy over this unexpected plea and appeal
 lekin wo to fouran iske khilaaf tan gaye
 It is being told that three days ago, tremendous support for extending Chidambaram's CBI detention period, Mehta immediately broke down on Sibal and Singhvi with ration water
 ab unka kahana he ki supreme court isamen kyon dakhal de
 The special court should decide for how long to keep it in custody and when to send it to judicial custody
 lihaaja supreme court is bare main kuch naa kare
 Sources say that on Friday, the CBI will not insist on further extending the custody of Chidambaram
 jisase nateeja ye hoga ki chidambaram ko nyaayik hiraasat main tihaad jail bhejnaa hoga
 The CBI will decide on September 5 whether to seek custody of Indrani Mukherjee and other 'witnesses' again in the name of confronting Chidambaram after the Supreme Court verdict comes
 isi dauraan idi ke daanv bhi supreme court ke ruukh par nirbhar karenge
 Because till the 5th, the Supreme Court has stayed the ED

 chif justise kii fatkaar ke baad supreme court ke varisht vakil rajeev dhawan ne practice chhodane kaa faisla kiya he
 He has conveyed a letter in this regard to CJI Deepak Mishra
 apane letters main dhawan ne gambhir aarope lagaaya he
 In a letter to the Chief Justice, advocate Rajiv Dhawan said, "I have decided to leave the court practice after the humiliation during the Delhi vs Central Government case
" darasal, 5 disambar ko supreme court main ram mandir mudde par sunwaayee hui thi
 During this time there were several senior lawyers including Congress leaders and senior lawyers Kapil Sibal, Rajiv Dhawan and Dushyant Dave
 ye vakil cese kii sunwaayee july 2019 tak taalane kaa anurodh karte hue oonchi aawaaj main daleelein pesh kar rahe thea
 Rajiv Dhawan even threatened to walkout
 iske baad dilli banaam centre sarkaar cese kii sunwaayee hui
 During this, Rajiv Dhawan had a heated debate with the Chief Justice
 dhawan kaa kahana he ki is cese kii sunwaayee ke dauraan unhen apamaanit kiya gaya
 Due to which, he decided to leave the practice of the Supreme Court
 court ne kya kaha thacort ne kaha tha ki adaalat main sunwaayee ke dauraan dhauns jamaane or oonchi aawaaj main bolne vaale vakeelon ke aacharan ko sharmnaak bataaya tha
 Also said that it will not be tolerated at any cost
 jammu-kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene sambandhi dhara 370 ko lekar daakhil ek yachika par sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko notice jari kiya he
 This petition has been filed by an NGO in Delhi
 yachika main artical 370 ko chunauti di gai he, jo jammu-kashmir ko vishesh rajya kaa darja detii he
 In its petition, the NGO has questioned why the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly has passed a law which deprives people living in other parts of the country to buy real estate or employment in the state
 yachika main jammu-kashmir main kisi bhi kanoon kii khilaafat ko lekar asamarthta ke sambandh main bhi sawaal kiya gaya he
 Significantly, the right wing of the country's politics has been opposing Article 370 for a long time
 centre kii satta par asin bijepi main bhi jammu-kashmir se 370 hataane kii maang ko lekar awaajen uthati rahi hai
 Although the Modi government has not clarified its position on Article 370, but soon after coming to power, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Jitendra Singh said in a statement that the government was ready for discussion and debate on the issue
 duusari ore, jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne chetavanee di he ki agar dhara 370 par phir se bahes chhedi jaati he to rajya bhartiya sangh main vilay kii sharton par phir se vichaar karegaa
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, BJP had said in its election manifesto that it was in favor of removing Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, but all related issues would be discussed before taking any decision
 beete saal disambar maheene main jammu main ek raily ke dauraan narendra modi ne suzav diya tha ki is baat kii jaanch honi chahie ki rajya ke logon ko dhara 370 se phayda pahunchaa he yaa nuksaan

 Senior Shiv Sena leader Manohar Joshi has claimed that NCP president Sharad Pawar agreed to tie up with his party (shiv Sena) in the last assembly elections in Maharashtra
 loksabhaa ke purv adhyaksh joshi ne pitiai ko bataaya, varsh 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav main pavaar ne shivasena ke saath gathbandhan karne kii ichha jaahir kii thi
 Asked who had taken the initiative regarding the alliance, Joshi said that he is not able to remember it at the moment
 mujhase uddhavji (shivasena ke vartmaan adhyaksh) ne pavaar ke saath baatcheet karne ke liye kaha tha or maine kiya
 The former chief minister said, Pawar later retreated
 main nahin jaanata ki kyon aisa hua
 On Joshi's claim, NCP spokesman Nawab Malik said, "there is no place for Joshi in Shiv Sena
" us party ne unhen rajyasabha or loksabhaa kaa tikat dene se manaa kar diya
 Malik said, he is trying to make a place for himself in the party by talking such nonsense
 joshi ke khulaase se pehle shivasena-bijepi ke varisht netaaon uddhav thakare or gopinath munde ne kaha tha ki pavaar endie main shaamil hona chaahate hai
 Munde had said, if anyone is waiting for anything, he is Pawar himself and he is waiting to join the NDA
 bijepi netaa ke kathan ne is vivaad ko or tool de diya, jo shivasena ke adhyaksh uddhav thakare ke is daawey se shuru hua tha ki unke virodh ke kaaran pavaar endie main shaamil nahin ho sake the
 Munde had said that Pawar had approached the NDA leaders
 maine uddhav se or phir maharashtra main gathbandhan ke anya bhagidaaron se is bare main baat kii thi
 And we all decided that we will not allow Sharad Pawar and his NCP to join the NDA

 With the support of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the problems of the leaders of the grand alliance have increased inside
 yahi kaaran he ki ghatak dalon main aapasi khinchataan ke chalate unke netaaon kii jubaan phisal ja rahi he
 The same thing happened with Rabri Devi, wife of former Bihar Chief Minister and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad
 purv mukhyamantri rabari devi ne vidhansabha parisar main na keval bijepi netaaon ke khilaaf abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya, balki unhone mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko bhi nahin bakhsha
 Former Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi, famous for making objectionable statements, was answering questions from reporters in the assembly premises
 bolte-bolte wo bol gayi ki bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi, mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko apane ghar le jaaen or apni bahan se shaadi kara den
 Soon after Rabri Devi's statement, the politics of Bihar suddenly got heated and not only BJP, but JDU have also objected to this statement
 darasal, purv mukhyamantri rabari devi vidhanparishad main bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi se maafee kii maang kar rahi thi or sadan ko chalane nahin de rahi thi
 Rabri Devi says that unless Sushil Kumar Modi does not apologize in the House, she will not let the House run
 rabari ne kaha ki pichley 25 varshon main sibiai ne unke ghar se lekar unke rishtedaaron ke ghar tak kalaadhan kii talash main chhapamari kii to unhen kya mila
 Then why did Sushil Kumar Modi say about Lalu Prasad that he has black money
 rabari devi ne kaha ki lalu prasad hameshaa se kalaadhan ke khilaaf rahe hai or aaj bhi uske khilaaf hai
 Former Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi said that she is against black money and not against demonetisation
 rabari ne kaha ki nitish kumaar bhi kalaadhan kaa samarthan nahin kar rahe, balki wo bhi notebandi kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 In response to a question, Rabri Devi said that the Mahagathbandhan is unbreakable and no matter how many media people try, the Mahagathbandhan is not going to break, the government in Bihar will run for five years
 jab purv mukhyamantri rabari devi se ye poocha gaya ki bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi kah rahe hai ki nitish kumaar waapas bijepi main aa jaaen, to rabari devi bhadak gayi or boleen ki susheel modi, nitish kumaar ko apane ghar le jaaen or apni bahan se shaadi se kara den
 However, later Rabri Devi said that she had said these things in jest

 is pariyojna se jal aapurti main baadha hone kii ashanka par bharat kii chintaa bad gai he
 India fears that China may release water from these dams during the conflict, which would pose a serious risk of flooding in India
 dedh arab dollar kaa centrechin ke vuhaan main sthit pramukh chini panbizli thekedaar ‘china gezouba group’ ne sarkari samachar agency ‘shinhua’ ko bataaya ki kendra kii sabhi ikaayiyon kaa samavesh power grid main kara diya gaya he or isse dedh arab dollar ke kendra ne sanchaalan karnaa shuru kar diya
 The Brahmaputra river that comes to India from Tibet is located in Gyassa County of Nishannan Prefecture, Jam Hydro Power Station, also known as Jangmu Hydropower Station
 yah brahmaputra nadi ke pani kaa istemaal karata he
 The Brahmaputra River is known as the Yarlung Zangbo River in Tibet
 yah nadi tibet se bharat aati he or phir vahaan se bangladesh jaati he
 Why this dam is special: This dam is known as the world's highest altitude hydroelectric power station
 yah apane kism kii sabase badi pariyojna he jo ek saal main 2
 Will produce 5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity
 company ne kaha, ‘yah madhya tibet kii bijli kii killat dur karegi or bijli kii kami vaale kshetra main vikaas laaegi
 It is also an important energy base of Central Tibet
 ’ shinhua kii report ke anusaar adhikariyon ne kaha he ki jab garmiyon main bijli prachur hogi to uske ek hisse kaa pareshan pados ke chhinghai praant main kiya jayega
 Even more dam is building
 The first unit of this project started its operation in November last year
 jangamu ke alaava china kuch or baandh bana rahaa he
 Meanwhile, China is trying to allay India's concerns by saying that these are 'run-of-the-river' projects that have not been designed for water storage
 honi chahie nigaraneebrahmaputra par bharat ke ek antar-mantralay visheshgy samooh (IMEG) ne 2013 main kaha tha ki ye baandh upari ilaake main banaae ja rahe hai
 The group called for monitoring of these in view of their impact on the flow of water in low-lying areas
 samooh ne rekhaankit kiya tha ki teen baandh- jieshu, jangamu or jiya ek duusare se 25 kilometre ke daayre main or bhartiya seemaa se 550 kilometre kii duuri par hai
 As per India's consensus in 2013, the Chinese side agreed to provide the Brahmaputra floods during May to October instead of June to October
 2008 or 2010 ke nadi jal karaaron main june se aktubar ke dauraan aankade pradaan karne kaa praavdhaan tha
 India worries that the Brahmaputra river projects, especially the Upper Siang and Lower Suanshri projects in Arunachal Pradesh, may be affected if the water is obstructed

 It is worth noting that the feedback received by the BJP after voting in 209 seats out of 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh has increased the bjp's concern
 sutara bataate hai ki sangh ne bhi bhaajapa ko teen charnon kaa jo feed back bheja he vah utsahvardhak nahin he
 BJP was expecting more BJP had expected that the voting would be bumpy but even though the voting percentage may have increased but not in line with the expectations of the BJP and the Sangh
 uttarapradesh main bachi hui 194 siton ke liebhajapa ne sanghase madad kii guhaar lagaai he
 In a message sent to the Sangh, the BJP has said that the next four phases are very important for it and the BJP, which is facing a tough challenge from the opposition parties, needs the Sangh's help
 sutara bataate he ki sangh ko booth management ke saath vot pratishat badhaane ke liye sangh ke jamini kaaryakartaaon or bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ko sakriy karne ko kaha ja rahaa he
 The BJP believes that if the volunteers of the Sangh take the responsibility of taking the voters out of the house to the polling booth on the day of polling, the BJP will get a lot of relief from it
 sangh ne bhi diya he puraa bharosasang se jude sutara bataate hai ki sangh ne bhi bache chaar charnon main bhaajapa kii naiya paar lagane ke liye puri takat lagane kaa bharosa bhaajapa ke sheersh netritv ko diya he
 The Sangh has directed field campaigners of Meerut, Braj, Kanpur, Awadh and Kashi to activate volunteers in favor of the BJP
 bhaajapa kaa akalan he ki bachi hui siton par sangh ne sakriyata dikhaate hue apnijamini takatka istemaal bhaajapa ke paksh main kar diya to bhaajapa kii jeet sunishchit ho sakati he
 The Sangh has directed officials from the township, mohalla, city level to the province and the region to create an atmosphere in favor of the BJP
 haalanki sangh kii is jamini mehnat bhaajapa ke kitne kaam aati he yah to aane vaale 11 march ko hi pataa chal paaegaa

 Singh said that no one in the Congress has said or announced that he is Rahul's advisor, but still it is discussed repeatedly
 unhone kaha ki yah kahana bhi sahi nahin hoga ki ve keval hindu aatankwaadiyon ke hi khilaaf bolte rahete hai
