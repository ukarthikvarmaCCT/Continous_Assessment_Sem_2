bharat ne videshi dharti par aakhri test 2011 main west indies main jeeta tha
 India won that series 1–0
 dhoni haalanki ateet main jeene main vishwaas nahin rakhte, lekin itihaas se sabak liya ja saktaa he
 India made Rahul Dravid the mentor of this team before this Test series
 dravid us team kaa hissaa the, jisane 2002 main paanch test kii shrunkhlaa kheli thi
 At that time, the Sourav Ganguly-led Indian team won the first Test, but lost the series with the third and fifth Tests
 us daure kii tarah is siries main kisi test ke bich abhyaas match nahin he
 The 40-day tour is a long one, in which India will have to avoid over-arming the bowlers in addition to complacency
 shuukravaar ko shikhar dhawan, viraat kohli or rohit sharma ne ballebaaji kaa kadaa abhyaas kiya
 Dhawan and Kohli are yet to do anything amazing, while Rohit has not got a place in the playing XI
 match se pehle do din unhone kaaphi abhyaas kiya, jiske myne hai ki unhen is match main utaara ja saktaa he
 The selection of the fifth bowler will also be complicated
 pehle do test main stuart binni ne sirf 20 over phenke or donon spel pehali pari main daale
 The hosts batted only once at Trentbridge and Binny did not bowl an over in the second innings at Lord's
 dhawan or murali vijay se bhi gendbaaji karai gai thi
 Rohit can bowl irregular spin and he can be fielded by adopting the formula of four bowlers with seven batsmen
 paanchaven gendbaaj ko nahin utaarne se haalanki yah sanket ja saktaa he ki bharat ab rakshaatmak khel par utaaru he
 Being a fifth bowler reduces mental pressure on the leading bowlers
 unhen raahat dene ke liye jadeja or binni ke 20 over jaruri hai
 India's inexperienced bowlers have so far performed better than England's more experienced bowlers
 lords kii hari-bhari pich par jahaan james anderson or stuart broad naakaam rahe, vahiin bharatiyon ne iskaa puraa phayda uthaaya
 Goa, crime and arrest
 
 
 apni khabaron se tahalaka machaane vaale patrkaar tarun tejpal kii zindagi main aaj aisa tahalaka machaa, jisase bachane ke liye unhone sari taaqat laga di thi
 After being accused of sexual exploitation, Tejpal's first attempt was to somehow avoid his arrest, for this, he reached the Goa and expressed his intentions by appearing before the police repeatedly, but his efforts on the court Had no effect
 akhirkaar tejpal kii agrim zamaanat arzi kaarij ho gai or wo giraftaar ho gaye
 But all this sharafat of Tarun Tejpal for advance bail was left to the ground
 goa pahunchane ke baad khud ko adaalat kii nigahon main acha dikhaane kii ye tamaam koshishen akhirkaar naakaam sabit hui
 And that is what Tejpal was constantly trying to avoid
 idhar, lambii chali sunwaayee ke baad adaalat ne tejpal ko agrim zamaanat dene se manaa kar diya or udhar krime branch ke daftar main hi maujuud tejpal ko goa police ne giraftaar kar liya
 On the one hand, on the one hand, Tarun Tejpal was accused of not cooperating in the investigation, on the other hand, during the incident, his CCTV footage and e-mail confessed to Tejpal's bail application was also important for Tejpal's bail plea
 Been involved in the reasons
 vaise dilli main tejpal or goa police kaa jo rishta tha, wo tejpal ke goa pahunchate hi bilkul ulta ho chukaa
 In Delhi, the Goa police were running after Tejpal, raiding in search of him, and in Goa, Tejpal was running after the police
 tejpal kii agrim zamaanat kii arzi par bahes kya shuru hui, tejpal apni sharafat dikhaane ke liye police ke paas jate rahe or police ab unhen hi giraftaar karne ke liye unheen se duuri banaati rahi
 The situation was such that even when the court was going to pronounce its decision on Tejpal's anticipatory bail application, Tejpal was still sitting in the office of the same Goa Crime Branch
 
 
 jo krime branch unhen giraftaar karnaa chahta tha
 It was the arrogance of the Goa Police to take Tejpal under his control, due to which, despite Tejpal repeatedly coming to the crime branch office himself, the Goa police did not answer the questions related to the case even once
 balki pehali baar shuukravaar shaam ko jab tejpal adaalat se mili antarim raahat ke baad krime branch ke daftar pahunche, to police ne unase kuch dastavezi kanoonee khanapuri karvaa kar unhen jane diya
 In the court, the police were already calling these efforts of Tejpal a mask, and the police even said that Tejpal is changing his complexion just like a chameleon
 kal tak kamyaabi or shoharat kii shikhar par baithe tejpal kaa tilism faqat ek ilzaam se kuch aisa tutaa ki jo log ab tak tejpal ko nahin jaanate the, wo bhi jaanane lag gaye
 Rather, he started to know not only, but also started cursing them after listening to the story of his handiwork
 haalat ye ho gai ki chand rose pehle jis tejpal ne ek celibrity kii tarah goa kii dharti par qadam rakhaa tha, ilzaam se ghirne ke baad jab vahi tejpal goa pahunche to jagah-jagah kaale jhande or bannron ne unka khayr-makadam karnaa shuru kar diya
 
 
 Moreover, this trend continued for the second day
 lekin pichley kai dinon se chale aa rahe tejpal kii giraftaar ke episod par akhirkaar kaa adaalat ke faisale ke baad phulstop lag hi gaya
 Tejpal went on presenting himself to the police like a guest, for the last ten days, who were not looking for the Tarun Tejpal era
 vahi tarun tejpal jab ek baar saamne aae to phir bin bulaae mehmaan kii tarah police ke paas pesh hote chale gaye
 The situation was such that after reaching Goa, the police did not even call him for questioning even once, but Tejpal was that he had attended the crime branch office twice in a few hours
 tejpal kii is kavayad main kaanoon ke liye kitni izzat chhipi thi, ye to nahin pataa, lekin kaanoon ke jaankaron kii maane to unki ye koshish police or adaalat ke saamne ye impressant dene kii zarur thi ki wo behad pro-active tareeke se jaanch main sahyog kar rahe hai
 The police and the defense debate, the result of their drifting day by day was also revealed
 lekin isse pehle tejpal kii agrim zamaanat ko lekar police or bachaav paksh jo bahes hui wo bhi sunne laayak thi
 Tejpal's lawyers made every effort to instill mercy in the heart of the court for his client
 jaanch main sahyog kaa bharosa to diya hi, ye bhi kaha ki jab tak diaiji nahin chahenge tejpal goa nahin chodenge or ve aisa tab tak karenge, jab police unke khilaaf chargeshit daakhil nahin kar detii yaa phir is maamle main closer report fil nahin ho jaati
 Every possible effort to get the application approved in the court
 During the debate in several installments in the morning, Tejpal's lawyers offered to hand over his passport even the other documents related to the money, including FD, and said that till his client was so If they are going ahead and assisting the police in the investigation, then it is not necessary to arrest them
 bachaav paksh ne yahaan tak kaha ki balaatkaar kaa mulzim hone kaa matlab gunahagaar hona to nahin he
 But this atmosphere is reminiscent of the Middle Ages
 tejpal khud muajziz logon main ek hai or hameshaa maanavadhikaron ke haq main khadey rahe hai, aise main poochtacha ke liye unhen giraftaar kiya janaa gairzaruri he
 But in the meantime, the effect of these arguments started to reverse
 darasal, tejpal ke vakeelon ne unke khilaaf shikaayat karanevaali ladki par bhi ye kehete hue sawaal uthaae ki akhir usne itane dinon baad maamle kii shikaayat kyon kii?haalanki police ne 14 dinon ke liye tejpal kii nyaayik hiraasat maang kar bachaav paksh kii tamaam daleelon ko hawa main uda diya
 The police had said that Tejpal is showing off, not cooperation in the investigation
 agar, unhen sahyog karnaa hi tha to wo dilli main police ke saamne kyon nahin aae? tejpal tabhi nazar aae, jab unhen adaalat se antarim raahat mili
 The police also reminded that it was Tejpal who matched the office and apologized to the girl
 or ab agrim zamaanat ke liye bahes aise kar rahe hai, jaise cese kaa trial chal rahaa ho
 It is obvious that in the case where there is such a huge legal pull for just advance bail, there is still more screw-o-kham in the case
 echemadi global ne Nokia 3310 kaa nayaa vairient launch kar diya he
 This variant is named Nokia 3310 3G

 Former Home Minister Buta Singh has termed senior BJP leader LK Advani as the grand father of the 2G spectrum scam and demanded to be questioned in the matter and advised social activist Anna Hazare to stay away from politics
 jalandhar main buudhvaar ko ek dharmik sanghathan dwaara yojit samuhik vivaah samaaroh main aae bootaa singh ne kaha ki 2ji spectrum ke liye akele centre kii samprag sarkaar doshi nahin he
 It is necessary to get to the bottom of it
 yah ghotaalaa tab se ho rahaa he, jab laalkrishna adwani soochna prasaaran mantri the
 He is the architect of this scam
 bootaa ne jor dekar kaha ki is maamle main adwani se bhi poochtacha honi chahie, taaki sahi jaankaree saamne aa sake
 It is not appropriate to blame the UPA government and Congress for this
 hisar loksabhaa upachunaav main congress ko vot na dene kii anna hajaare kii apil ke sambandh main puche jane par unhone kaha ki anna hajaare ko is raajnneeti se bachanaa chahie, varna unki chhavi kharaab hogi
 He said that Anna had raised the issue of struggle against corruption

 The printing machine was interrupted to prevent the publication of an article about the stately lifestyle of an official in a Chinese government newspaper while its editor in chief objected to this government interference in media work
 yunaan sthit ‘city times’ ke adhyaksh or sampadak jhou jhichen ne kaha, ‘‘hamaare samachar patr ke hajaaron pratiyon ko badale jane ke baad mediakarmi hone ke naate maine itnaa gussa or sharmindagi kabhi mahasoos nahin kiya tha jitna ki aaj mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 "three lakh copies of this newspaper were changed

 Mahindra said that they have resolved on behalf of all employees of their group that the group and all its 100 companies would be completely carbon neutral 10 years before the agreed timeframe for the world in the Paris Agreement
 vishwa aarthik manch (dablyooef) kii vaarshik baithak ke dauraan unhone kaha ki bharat, pashchim sahit kai anya deshon ke vipareet, paris patibaddhtaon ko puraa karne ke liye trek par he, ham peeche nahin hat rahe hai
 Everyone in India is concerned about climate change

 When asked about the problem of air pollution in Indian cities, Mahindra said that India is one of the youngest countries and the youth also understand that it is a matter of survival

 12 hours before the dgp's school started, Belgaum soldiers shot dead Vivek Tiwari, the area sales manager of the Apple company, at around two in the night in Gomtinagar area of the capital Lucknow
 shahar ke ek hotel main iphone ke lonching samaaroh ke baad vivek apni esayuvi se purv sahakarmi ko chhodie uske ghar ja rahe the
 Meanwhile, two soldiers, Prashant Chaudhary and Sandeep Kumar, who were on a Chetak motorcycle near the Makhdumpur police checkpoint, hinted at stopping Vivek

 Policemen Hoshiar Singh, Shariq Ali, Shailesh Kumar Singh, who were posted in different districts sacked from service during the last two years, filed a petition against their dismissal in the High Court
 court ne sunwaayee ke dauraan pratham drushtya paaya ki vibhaag ne pulicekarmiyon ke khilaaf karrwai main niyamon kaa paalan nahin kiya
 On July 27, Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra made strict remarks against the police officers
 court ne kaha, ''kanoon kii jaankaree hone ke baad bhi adhikari agar galat aadesh de rahe hai to iskaa arth yahi he ki ve doshi karmchaariyon ko bachane kaa mauka de rahe hai
 Vijay Gautam, a lawyer who is fighting a legal battle in the court against dismissal, says that many policemen were arrested by the Superintendents of Police under Section 8 (2) (b) of the 'UP Police Officers of Subordinate Rank (punishment and Appeal) Rules-1991'
 Is dismissed

" ''vivek tiwari ke hatyaropee donon sipaahiyon ko seva se barkhaast karne main bhi 'upi police officers of sabordinate rank (panishment and apil) rules-1991' kii dhara 8(2)(bi) kaa hi sahaara liya gaya he

 aise main 40,000 sipaahiyon or daaroga kaa prashikshan ek jugad ke taur par jaldbaaji main alag-alag charnon main karaayaa gaya jo kisi bhi kaam kaa nahin tha

 Everyone's eyes were on this meeting

 But local body minister Sidhu has not reached the cabinet meeting

 The cabinet meeting did not include any agenda of the local bodies department
 isliye siddhu ke baithak main shaamil hone par sanshay bana hua tha
 It was feared that if Sidhu does not participate in the meeting, his troubles may increase further
 lekin siddhu ne baithak main bhaag nahin liya
 Earlier on May 30, the Chief Minister called a meeting
 congress vidhayakon or saansadon kii is baithak main siddhu shaamil nahin hue the
 Which was taken very seriously by the Chief Minister
 tab amarinder singh ne yah bhi pataa karaayaa tha ki siddhu ko baithak main shaamil hone kaa sandesh bheja gaya tha ki nahin
 Sidhu is on target of ministers close to the chief minister
 khaas baat yah he ki captain amarinder siddhu se sthaneey nikaay vibhaag lene kii taiyaari kar chuke hai
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress got 8 out of 13 seats in Punjab

 The Election Commission on Saturday organized a challenge to hack evms which began with a detailed demonstration of various security checks in the machine
 chaar ghante kii chunauti subah 10 baje shuru hui or ensipi or sipiem ne hi is kaarykram main hissaa liya
 The CPM delegation witnessed the demonstration given on various security checks in the machine while the NCP team interacted with the experts of the technical committee of the commission
 donon partiyon ko chaar-chaar iviem di gayi jo dilli, punjab, uttar pradesh tathaa uttarakhand se laai gayi, jahaan unhen haal main hue vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan lagaaya gaya tha
 The challenge was organized after several major opposition parties claimed that people had lost their trust due to tampering of evms
 haalanki ayog is baat adig rahaa ki iviem ke saath chhedchhad nahin kii ja sakati he
 The BSP and AAP had alleged that the machines used in the recent assembly elections were tampered with following which the machines gave results in favor of the BJP
 baad main, kai anya partiyaan isamen shaamil ho gai or unhone maang kii ki ayog phir se matapatron se matdaan karaae
 However, according to the Election Commission, both the participating parties in the EVM Challenge are only trying to understand the technical aspects of evms, not appearing to be manipulated or challenged
 ayog ne sabhi 7 rashtriya or 48 rajyastareey partiyon ko iviem main chhedchhad karke dikhaane ke chunauti di thi, jise sirf 2 partiyon ne sweekaar kiya tha
 Even after the AAP made such a ruckus on EDMVM, only two national parties will participate in this challenge
 jisamen neshnal congress party (ensipi) or communist party of india (sipiiem) shaamil hai
 The most disturbing Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has opted out of this hack
 aap kaa kahana he ki chunaav ayog sabakuch apane mutabik kar rahaa he
 Actually, you wanted the Election Commission to allow it to tamper with the Mother Board, while the Election Commission flatly refused to allow the Mother Board to open
 chalange ko hai court se anumatinainital hai court ne chalange ko manjuuri de di thi
 Asked the Election Commission that the Commission should conduct at its discretion
 ayog ne iviem chunauti ke aayojan ko rokane kii yachika khaarij kar di
 The bench of Nainital High Court judges Rajiv Sharma and Sharad Sharma clearly stated in the fifth page of their 17-page order that the Election Commission's EVM is safe
 desh main hi inaki chip banati he or van time printbal he
 There are many such systems with micro number systems that they become impenetrable
 yahaan tak ki inhen transportesan yaa strog room main storad ke dauraan bhi hack yaa chhedchhad nahin kiya ja saktaa
 On the last page of its 17-page order, the court has written that it is the responsibility and responsibility of the court to help the constitutional institutions to maintain their dignity
 abhivyakti kii azaadi hone kaa matlab ye katai nahin he ki sanvaidhanik sansthaaon par bevajaah chhintakashi karen
 Play with their dignity
 lihaaza kisi bhi raajnneetik party, sanghathan yaa phir vyakti ko chunaav ayog jaisi sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ke khilaaf apmanjanak tippanee karne se bachanaa chahie
 The court said that the commission can conduct it as it wants

 Despite US warnings, India finally signed a five billion dollar agreement to buy the S-400 air defense system from Russia on Friday
 is missile system kii deal ko lekar varsh 2015 se bharat-rus ke bich baat chal rahi thi
 Many countries want to buy this system from Russia because it is considered better than the Thad (terminal High Altitude Area Defense) system of the US
 hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki donon deshon ke bich hue is bade samjhaute kaa donon deshon ke netaaon ne apni press vaarta main zikr tak nahin kiya
 Reliance has entered into a deal with the company making the S-400
 During the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow in 2015, Anil Ambani's company Reliance Defense signed a possible $ 6 billion manufacturing and maintenance deal with almaz-ante of Russia
 bataa den ki almaj-anti rosoboronxport kii sahaayak company he or es-400 kii pramukh nirmaataa he
 On December 24, 2015, Corelion Infrastructure Ltd mentioned this in a press release
 isamen likhaa tha ki dissi ne es-400 vaayu raksha missile system ke adhigrahan ko manjuuri dekar 6 arab dollar ke vyapaar kaa mauka diya he
 India's Reliance Defense Limited and Russia's flagship manufacturer of air defense missile systems almaz-ante have decided to work jointly with India
 jaankaree ke mutabik reliance group ke chairman anil ne press relies main kaha tha ki hamaari prastaavit saajhedaari donon deshon ke bich ranneetik sambandhon ke liye mile kaa pathar sabit hogi
 At the same time, the vice-chairman of almaz-anti had said that working with Reliance Defense will give both companies a new direction to meet the needs of India's security forces in the future
 bataa den ki is deal main reliance industries kaa naam aane se modi sarkaar kii museebataan bad sakati hai
 Because since the name of Reliance on the Rafale issue, the opposition has been continuously besieging the Modi government
 vahiin ab bharat-rus kii is deal main reliance kaa naam aane par vipaksh ise bhi mudda bana saktaa he
 Significantly, in an interview to a French magazine by French President Francois Hollande, Hollande revealed that the Indian government had proposed the name of Anil Ambani's Reliance for the Rafale deal and Dassault Aviation has an agreement with Reliance There was no other option but to do it
 america laga saktaa he ballmerica lagaataar rus se kisi bhi tarah kii raksha kharid karne par bain lagane kii dhamkee detaa rahaa he
 The US has said that India's deal with Russia falls under their CAATSA section 231, due to which it can ban the deal
 darasal, america ne countering americaj adwiserij thru sanksons act (CAATSA) ke jariye rus se kisi bhi tarah kii raksha kharid par roak laga rakhi he
 However, earlier the US had shown soft attitude to the deal and said that the purpose of imposing sanctions on Russia is not to damage the military capabilities of its allies and partners
 ham kisi bhi tarah ke pratibandh ke faisle ko purvaagrah nahin bana sakate hai
 The method of payment of money is also being discussed on the way of payment of church money
 donon desh chaahate hai ki is deal par paison kaa bhugtan is tarah ho ki america us par kisi tarah kaa koi bain naa laga sake
 Payment should be such that the economy, trade and security can go on without any hindrance and hassle
 darasal menuphacturer company almaj-anti america pratibandhon kii list main he, jisaki vajah se is par banking lenden par roak lagi hui he
 India may get a concession on this deal from America, but a ban on the company may come in the way of this deal
 S-400 paane vaala bharat teesraa desh-rus ke saath S-400 deal hone ke baad bharat duniya kaa teesraa desh hoga jiske paas yah missile system he
 Russia has done this before with China and Turkey
 -saudi arab ke saath bhi is missile system kii kharid ko lekar baat chal rahi he
 - Pakistan is very worried about this deal
 abhi haal main vahaan ke soochna mantri fawaad choudhary ne rus ke saath is deal ko badi pareshaani bataaya
 Chaudhary said, 'india is using its powers against Pakistan
 rus ke bharat ke saath achche rishte hai lekin pakistan bhi rus ke kareeb aa rahaa he
 Therefore, Russia should not bet this deal only with India

 Kalraj Mishra is counted among the top BJP leaders
 modi sarkaar ke pehle kaarykaal main unhen sookshm, laghu evam madhyam udyog mantralay (swatantra prabhaar) kaa jimmaa saunp gaya tha
 Kalraj Mishra won from Deoria Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki, baad main calraj mishra se mantri pad le liya gaya tha
 He did not contest the Lok Sabha elections this time
 calraj mishra saal 1991, 1993, 1995 or 2000 main bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh rahe hai
 In 2003, he became in charge of Uttar Pradesh and in 2004 in Rajasthan and Delhi
 saal 2010 main bijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh ghoshit kiye gaye
 MLA was elected in the 2012 assembly elections
 saal 2014 main devaria loksabhaa seat se saansad bane
 He has now been made the Governor of Himachal Pradesh

 (from input language) rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne pichley mangalvaar ko apane mantrimandal main pherbadal ke tahat ek safed hathi se dianosor rach diya
 When he distributed portfolios to ministers on Thursday, it became clear that the latest statement made by Congress leader Mahir Azad about the government has not changed at all
 aaazaad ne jhalawad main haal hi kaha tha ki ''sarkaar pichley teen saal se so rahi he
 Gehlot first wrote resignations from all his ministers and parliamentary secretaries
 mantri shanti dhariwal se mileebhagat karke unhone yah chaal chali
 At first, Dhariwal resigned, as if he was telling how much confidence he has in Gehlot's leadership
 lekin sahi myanon main gahalot kii yah hadabdaahat bhari kavayad ek acha-khaasaa majaak banakar rah gai
 People described it as another trick of Gehlot to hide his mistakes
 paanch mantriyon ko hataane ke baad chah nae mantri tathaa saat or sansadeey sachiv banaakar unhone ek or majaak kiya
 Now their number has increased to 40 i
e
 10 more than the constitutional limit of 30
 pichhali bhaajapa sarkaar ke dauraan mahaj chah sansadeey sachiv banaae jane par isi congress ne use sanvaidhanik maryaada kii dhadgijayaan udaana bataaya tha
 It was said that the Parliamentary Secretary reached equal to the ministers

 That is, there is no quibble to take responsibility of Dhariwal and no minister
 yah dhariwal ko shant karne kii chaal bhi ho sakati he
 Now it has to be seen how long the Gehlot Home Ministry takes, because they would not like to get into any big controversy
 shaharon main sadate kooday or gadde bhari sadakon ke baavjood dhariwal shahari vikaas or awaas mantri bane rahenge
 The rest of the shuffling is equally fun

 They face serious charges of corruption

 The child of Babulal Nagar, who is among the most accused of corruption, is not deterred as Gehlot pamper him
 binaa kaak, parasaadilal meena, rajendra pari or mahendrajit malviya ko atirikt prabhaar die gaye hai
 Malaviya has got rural development
 janajaatiy kshetra main to ve kuch kar na sake, ab yahaan kya karenge?gahalot ne kaha he ki ve aage or bhi vistaar karenge
 Now when the media speculates on this, they will accuse him of spreading instability
 or asthirataa kii ore to ve bad hi rahe hai
 By removing Golma Devi, she has teased her MP husband Kirori Lal Meena
 raghu sharma kaa dard he ki ve mukhya sachetak kii bajaae mantri banane ke kaabil the
 Gehlot does not remove his people despite their inefficiency

 At that pace, the high command may be happy even in 2013 by getting 32 seats

In response to a question, he said that Kejriwal will not become the CM candidate of Punjab in the 2017 elections, he is a resident of Haryana
 unhone kaha, 'hamaara haryana se saath pani kaa jhagada he
 There is also regional dispute
 'punjab congress kaa adhyaksh banaae janese jude sawaal par amarinder singh ne kaha, 'kisne kaha ki agar mujhe president nahin banaaya gaya, to party chhod duungaa
 This is not a fact
 ''rahul gandhi main aayaa badlaav'congress upaadhyaksh ke bare main unhone kaha, 'rahul gandhi main bahut badlaav aayaa he
 i have felt a change in them
 har koi sikh rahaa he
 Look at the Bihar elections
 
 
 ''bajva jo kar rahe, unki soch'pradesh or party kii andruni siyasat ke bare main amarinder singh ne kaha, 'bajva jo kar rahe hai, vah unki soch he
 i did not discus anything from anyone
 har koi vikalp dekhtaa he, isamen kuch galat nahin he
 i can't sit in a cold store
 ' gauratlab he ki pratap singh bajva ne guuruuvaar ko punjab congress ke adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya tha
 On the politics of Punjab, the former CM said, 'we wanted peace and we used to talk peace with Rajiv ji
 akali to sirf hotel banaate rahete hai
 All industries are leaving Punjab
 akali kuch nahin kar rahe hai
 Defending Blackman Parineet Kaur near Parineet, he said, 'he does not have blackman in Swiss bank
 mere paas puure kagajaat hai
 The bank has cleared everything
 ye sab arun jetali kar rahe hai, kyonki hamane unhen chunaav main haraaya tha
 ' mahesh bhupati ne ravivaar ko kaha ki team se liender pes ko baahar rakhane main unka koi nijee agenda nahin tha
 He said that the departure of his former partner from the middle of the match in Bangalore was the last nail in the coffin
 uzbekistan ke khilaaf bharat kedavis cap machake baad bhupati ne pes ke saath paanch march kii watsap chat ko fasebuk par saarvajanik kar diya tha
 In which Bhupathi is telling Pace that he has not yet decided on the combination but logically Rohan Bopanna is more suited to the situation in Bangalore
 pes ne iske baad bhupati par bhedbhaav kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 However, this whatsapp chat was later deleted from Facebook
 bhupati ne fasebuk post main likhaa, apane kariyar ke 20 saal ke dauraan meraa hameshaa se vishwaas rahaa ki tathy hameshaa saamne aate hai or jab tak ki mujhe giraaya nahin jaae main kabhi pratikriya nahin detaa kyonki kuch bhi kaha jaae media ise nijee shatruta bataata he
 First of all, let me say that there was no personal enmity
 gauratlab he ki jab main 1994 main davis cap team main aayaa to main liender kaa prashansak tha or use wain farera ke khilaaf khelte dekhakar romanchit tha jo duniya kaa 10wein number kaa khilaadi tha
 He said, he defeated Ferreira in straight sets
 main pes kaa prashansak se adhik ban gaya, tennis ke alaava tennis jagat or media main uskaa aakarshan tha
 However, things changed quickly when our captain Jaideep Mukherjee and coach Enrico Piperno were dropped from the team in late 1999 as they heard speculation that they were angry, as they did not come for the match against Italy but Chennai next week i was fully fit to play in the first differences
 bhupati ne kaha, sammaan shabd ke liye uski apni paribhaasha thi or jald hi yah spasht ho gaya ki trek par sirf ek rail he, yaa to aap is par chadh jaaiye yaa phir ghar baithiye
 i could write a book on the events of previous years but i am trying to keep them brief
 darasal pes ne har samay team main apni jagah ko ahmiyat nahin di

 In Karnataka politics, after Tipu Sultan, the Mughal ruler and freedom fighter Bahadur Shah Zafar has entered
 bijepi ne rahul gandhi par hamalaa bolte hue unhen congress kaa bahadur shah jafar bataa diya he
 Not only this, the BJP has also announced the Karnataka election results with an attack on Rahul Gandhi
 party ne apane twit main kaha he ki is chunaav main congress kii haar rahul gandhi kii siyasat ke liye aakhri prahaar sabit hogi
 BJP has written, 'congress party will also sink with Rahul Gandhi
 mughal vansh kii tarah, hameshaa ke liye
 
 
 This tweet came in response to a tweet by Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, in which he claimed that the youth of the state respected Rahul Gandhi and the Congress president had a great influence on the youth of the state
 isse pehle congress ne pradhanmantri narendra modi par asaram ko hathiyaar banaakar hamalaa kiya tha, or asaram ke saath modi kii tasviren or video share kiye the
 The interesting thing is that even though Rahul Gandhi has been called Bahadur Shah Zafar, the BJP has put the Mughal dynasty and Congress in one scale
 lekin, pradhanmantri narendra modi saal 2017 main myanmar daure ke samay antim mughal shaasha kii majaar par jaakar phool-maala arpit kar chuke hai

 'freedom was achieved only after the bugle of Independence in 1857' Ram Naik said at that time that the country got independence in 1947 only because of the bugle which triggered the independence of the country in 1857

 Both parties are fiercely backing each other's tweet
 isse pehle bijepi kii ore se pradhanmantri modi ke karnataka daure kii jaankaree dene vaala twit viral ho gaya tha, jis par soshal media yugers ne bhi chutki lee
 The BJP had tweeted a photo of Ned Stork, the character of Game of Thrones, about Modi's visit, and wrote, "feel yourself Congress, Modi is coming
" 'bijepi kaa ye twit party ko ulta pad gaya or soshal media yugers ne trol karnaa shuru kar diya

 bijepi ne uske mashhoor dialog 'winter is coming' ko badalakar 'modi is coming' kar diya gaya
 But the BJP may not have thought while tweeting that the character they have chosen to make Mim is beheaded in the next part

 While Sachin's last test match is being watched by the people of the country and abroad, the eyes of domestic and foreign bookies are also focused on the last two Test matches of Sachin
 darasal satta bazaar is maukey ko jamkar bhunaanaa chahta he
 The bookies keep a close watch on Sachin's actions
 yahi vajah he ki kareeb 1600 karod rupee kaa satta keval sachin par lag rahaa he
 This is happening for the first time in the history of the speculative market that so much money is being spent on one player
 sachin tendulkar kitne ran banaaenge, kitni genden khelenge, kitna wicket lenge, stump out honge, yaa phir clin bold honge yaa kaich out honge
 Speculative action on Sachin's actions satorion kii maane to agar sachin 25 ran bana lete hai to 12 paise kaa bhav hoga, sachin 50 ran banaate hai to 18 paise kaa bhav hoga, sachin kii centuri par 1 rupee 40 paise kaa bhav hoga, agar sachin 200 kaa aankada paar kar jate hai to 4 rupee kaa bhav hoga
 How Sachin will get out is also going to be very speculative
 jaise ki sachin agar kaich out honge to 38 paise kaa bhav hoga, clin bold honge to 16 paise kaa bhav hoga, elbeadblyoo out honge to 54 paisa lagegaa
 On the other hand, if Sachin will be able to take five wickets in both these matches, then there will be a price of 1 rupee 10 paise
 gauratlab he ki sattebaaj isi par satta laga rahe hai ki sachin kitne ran, centuri yaa dabl centuri bana pate hai
 The bookies are eyeing Sachin's last four innings
 eden garden main 6 november se shuru hue test match main bhi sachin khel rahe hai
 This is Sachin's 199th Test match
 antim test match sachin 14 november se 18 november tak mumbai ke vankhede main khelenge
 The match is against the West Indies team and everyone is assuming that the match will be in India's favor
 sachin kii pari ko lekar mumbai, jaipur, jodhpur, bikaner, nagpur, indore, dilli, kanpur ke saath-saath videshon main satta lag rahaa he
 Such is the atmosphere when the police of Mumbai and Delhi are lying behind the bookies
 lekin satorion ki maane to iskaa zyada prabhaav nahin padaa or satorie pehle se zyada chaalaak ho gaye hai
 Due to the keen eye of the police, the bookies have adopted a new way to run this business
 pehle paisa diposit karo phir is maidan main utar sakate hai, ye satorion kaa nayaa paitara he police ko jhansa dene kaa
 If you want to bet on Sachin, then you will be given an account number, in which you will be able to play only the amount of money you deposit
 jaise hi aap kaa paisa satorie ke acount main jamaa hoga, satoria aapako apane panter kaa number degaa, uske baad hi aap is khel main shaamil honge
 Speculators do not use the number once they are used again
 lekin mumbai police kaa daawa he ki unki paini nazar satorion par he or wo apni taraf se ise rokane ke liye bharpoor kadam uthaa rahe hai
 Joint Crime Commissioner of Mumbai Crime Branch told, “during the ipl we kept a close watch on the bookies and this time also we are aware
 'satte ke bazaar kaa jo bhi haal ho lekin puraa desh 'bhagwaan' ko vidaai dene ke liye un par nazar gadaaye hue he
 There are many records in Sachin's name, but this time a new record is waiting
 kisi ek khilaadi ke upar sabase zyada satta lagane kaa record
 According to experts, the biggest bet in history will be seen on Sachin

 chif justise ne kaha ki ayodhya cese main sunwaayee 18 oktober tak khatm honi jaruri he
 If the hearing is not completed by October 18, the chance of passing judgment will end
 iske baad jab guuruuvaar dopaher ko lunch ke baad nirvaani akhaada ne dakhal diya tab bhi chif justise bhadak gaye or poocha ki kya ham kaarykaal ke aakhri din tak sunwaayee karenge? supreme court main guuruuvaar ko ayodhya cese par sunwaayee kaa 32waan din he

 Because in those times it can also be a toy, which cannot be associated with any religion
 aroda ne kaha ki vahaan par 383 architekchar avshesh mili the, jisamen se 40 ko chhodkar koi bhi mandir kaa hissaa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 On the lotus mark on the rocks, Arora said that it cannot be said that it is a temple because it can be a sacred symbol of Jain, Muslim Buddhist and Hindu religions as well
 is par justise bobade ne poocha ki kya masjidon main bhi camel ke nishaan hote hai? is sawaal kaa minakshi aroda ne sidhaa jawaab nahin diya
 He said that maybe
 iske baad justise bobade ne apane saath bench main baithe jaj justise nazeer se iskaa jawaab jaananaa chaha ki kya masjidon main bhi camel ke nishaan hote hai
 Justice Nazir said that to my knowledge it is not so
 minakshi aroda ne kaha ki camel ke chitra ko hindu, muslim, buddha sabhi istemaal karte rahe he
 It has been used in Muslim and Islamic architects

 47 PM: Meenakshi Arora said that there are differences among many historians and archaeologists on the 85 pillars that are being talked about
 khambhe alag aakaar or oonchai ke hai
 If they were on the same surface, what would the height mean? He said, why can't that western-facing wall be of Idgah? What is the harm in assuming this? Because that wall is completely separate and alone and the pillars are completely different
 wo khambhe khokhli jagah par eenton kii jamaavat se bhi banaae gaye ho sakate hai
 On this, Justice Chandrachud said that we cannot draw any conclusion from the conclusion of the authors of the ASI report
 khambhon kii oonchai or aakaar par bhi CJI ne kaha ki isse aap ye bataanaa chaahati hai ki ye alag-alag floor alag alag samay me bane the

 sunwaayee ke dauraan chif justise ranjan gogoi ne vakeelon se kaha ki daleel ke bich main apni baat aakhri din yaa sunwaayee ke dauraan main kabhi bol sakate hai
 To the lawyers who want to raise their issue, the Chief Justice said that if we go on a debate, will there be a debate till the last day of my term? The CJI said that we have already given the schedule and now we will stand at the same time
 aap ek hi daleel ke saath aate rahete hai, aap duusare vakeelon se baat kar apni bahes ke liye vakt nikaal len
 The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court reminded the parties of the time limit

 20 PM: Meenakshi Arora told the court that the ASI report found three tier constructions resting on about 50 pillars excavated under disputed land, but all the floors were built in different periods
 pehla shaayad dhah gaya yaa dhans gaya tab doosraa bana tha
 He said that the ASI had exposed only four pillars
 isapar justise bobade ne poocha ki kya ye khambhe 50 meter vaali diwaar ko saport karne ko the? minakshi aroda ne jawaab diya ki nahin, khambhe diwaar se alag the
 Is there a description that those four pillars were built in different periods and the remaining 46 pillars in different periods? Read this: Ayodhya Case: The oldest case in history 11 stuck between miracles and challenges
 30 am:guuruuvaar ko ayodhya sunwaayee kaa 32waan din he
 Meenakshi Arora made her plea on behalf of the Muslim parties on the ASI report
 isapar muslim paksh kii ore se rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki ASI report kii pramanikta par sawaal nahin uthaaya ja saktaa he
 In fact, Meenakshi Arora said on Wednesday that there were no signs on the ASI report
 ab guuruuvaar ko minakshi aroda ne kaha ki ASI dwaara varnit adhikansh avadhi kaa mandir kii avadhi se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 (sunga, Kushan, Gupta etc
) On this, Justice Bobde asked him to tell him directly on Vikramaditya
 justise bhushan ne kaha ki gupt ke baad koi vikramaditya nahin tha
 Meenakshi Arora replied that Vikramaditya is related to Sunga and not to Gupta
 jawaab main justise bhushan ne kaha ki vah gupt ke hai, aap kripaya phir chack karen
 In her plea, Meenakshi Arora said that the ASI had admitted itself that it had difficulty identifying the layers
 kul 184 haddiyaan mili thi lekin hoicourt ne sirf 21
 Only 2% were studied
 unhone 9 sabhyataaon ke aadhaar par 9 samaykaal ke bare main bataaya tha
 Meenakshi said that the civilizations that ASI has told have nothing to do with the temple
 unhone bataaya ki carbon dating kaa istemaal yah pataa karne ke liye kiya jaataa he ki or chiz kitni puraani he
 But ASI does not use bones, so they are not carbon dating
 ise padhein: ayodhya cese: 18 oktober tak puri hogi sunwaayee? vakeelon ne maange itane dinahafte main paanch din or ek ghanta extra ho rahi sunwaayeeapako bataa den ki isse pehle bhi chif justise ranjan gogoi is baat par tippanee kar chuke hai ki sabhi pakshon ko koshish kerani chahie ki 18 oktober tak ayodhya maamle kii sunwaayee puri ho sake
 After this, because the Supreme Court will need a month to write a decision on this issue
 chif justise ke isi bayaan ke baad sarvocch adaalat ne is maamle kii sunwaayee kaa samay badha diya tha
 The ramjanmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute is now being heard in the Supreme Court five days a week, as well as the court is hearing this issue more than an hour daily
 yani sunwaayee ab shaam 5 baje tak sunwaayee kii ja rahi he
 The court had also said in this case that if needed, the court can also hear on Saturday

 Aviation Minister Ajit Singh said in the Lok Sabha that despite the High Court terming the pilots' strike as illegal, it is very sad for them not to return to work
 unhone hadataali payalton ko aashwaasan diya ki vah kaam par laut aae or prabandhan durbhaavna se prerit hokar karrwai nahin karegaa
 Responding to a special discussion under Rule 193 on the widespread disruption in the civil aviation sector in the House, he said that the strike has caused a loss of Rs 150 crore to Air India and inconvenience to passengers is different
 
 unhone kaha ki payalton jin chaar maangon par hadtaal par gaye hai, vah aise nahin the jinpar bina soochna diye or beemaari ke naam par achaanak hadtaal par chale jaaya jaae
 The minister said that in the light of the report of Justice Dharmadhikari Committee on the four subjects on which the striking pilots have gone on strike, a decision was to be taken within two-three months, the pilots should have shown endurance
 unhone hadataali payalton se apil kii ki ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh tathaa ‘peak sijan’ main yatriyon ko ho rahi ghor pareshaani ko dekhte hue vah kaam par laut aaen
 The four demands on which Air India pilots have gone on strike include granting them exclusive rights to fly newly purchased state-of-the-art Dreamliner aircraft, allowing them to fly first class in private voyages, reducing the tenure of commander from 10 years Doing six years is included
 vahiin air india ke hadataali payalton ke khilaaf kadaa rukh apanaate hue sarkaar ne kaha ki beemaari kaa bahaanaa banaakar kaam par nahin lautne vaale payalton ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi

 However, this time over-confidence led to the defeat

 In such a situation, voting also decreased and it became the reason for bjp's defeat

 a woman gave birth to a child in a cab while going to the civil hospital in Gurugram
 unke pati ne aspataal par bhartee karne main deree kaa aarope lagaaya
 The woman's husband Ramesh Yadav claimed that when they reached the hospital there was a delay of about an hour in the recruitment of the mother and child, which is a very important time as the risk of infection is very high during this time

 However, the hospital officials have denied any delay on their part

 noida jila prashasan ne skulon ke liye ek ajibo-garib circular jari kiya he
 It has been said in this circular to send a confidential list of students with criminal tendencies to the school district administration
 jila prashasan ke is circular seskool or abhibhavakadonon hi hairaan hai
 According to the schools, neither the mechanism of identifying the students of criminal tendency is with the schools nor do the schools want to develop any such mechanism
 JBM global skool kii prisimple dow upama aroda ke mutabik jila prashasan ye khud bataae ki aapraadhik pravriti ke bacchon ko skool kaise pahachaanen
 Because school work is to reform children
 agar bachche galat disha main ja rahe hai, tab bhi skool apane bacchon ko aapraadhik pravriti ke chaatr kaa darja dekar uskaa bhavishya nahin bigaad saktaa
 According to Dr
 Upma, we continue to offer counseling in schools as well as sessions like Value addition session, Spiritual session, Anger management
 taaki agar bachche kisi bhi tarah ke tanaav yaa avsaad main hai, unhen madad mili
 Schools try not to instill a criminal tendency in children
 aise main is circular ke jariye kisi bachche ko aapraadhik qaraar dena, bilkul uchit nahin he
 a well-known school told Aaj Tak on the condition of anonymity that they have received the circular of the district administration
 lekin wo is circular ko lekar asamanjas main hai
 According to the school, it is difficult to understand which children are placed in the category of criminal tendency
 aamtaur paraskulon menshikshak apane har chaatr kii gatividhi par najar rakhte hai
 Students whose behavior is different or bad from others, their information is given to the parents, so that the real problem of the student can be reached
 kai baar chaatro ke bich aapas main ladaai-jhagade hote hai, jinhen chaatr aapas main hi sulajhaate hai
 Some students become more excited
 aise chaatro ko skool ke daayre main hi behatar couseling di jaati he
 But should students who commit such acts be classified as students of criminal tendency? off course not
 skulon kaa kaam chaatro kii samasya kaa samaadhaan karte hue unke vyaktitv kaa vikaas karnaa he
 Not to list him as a student of criminal tendency
 is circular ke bare main jab ajtak ne abhibhavak sangh se baatcheet kii to wo bhi sakate main najar aae
 The parents, asking such circulars as unnecessary, asked questions directly to the district administration
 abhibhavakon ne poocha ki jila prashasan bataae ki aapraadhik pravriti ke maanak kya he? kya schuli bacchon main bad rahe aapraadhik pravriti ko pahchaanane kaa koi tarika jila prashasan ke paas he or agar kisi bachche main aisi pravriti he, tab bhi kya use namjad apradhi kii tarah aapraadhik pravriti ke chaatr kaa darja dena sahi hoga
 Despite the confidential list, will this list not affect the future of the child? schuylke hajaaron bacchon ke bich se kuch bacchon ko aapraadhik pravriti ke chaatr maanakar soochibaddh karne se kya chaatro kii maansik sthiti par galat asar nahin padegaa
 According to psychologist Dr Pooja Shivam Jaitley, with the changing times, criminal instincts are increasing in children, but this does not mean that children are identified and they are given criminal status
 dow jetali ne kaha ki is circular ko sahi tareeke se itanrpret karne kii jarurat he
 Schools, including parents, should monitor the activities of their children and if the child's behavior is seen as negative and aggressive, special attention should be paid to such children
 aise chaatr samvedansheel hote hai
 Therefore, instead of isolating them, they need to show positive direction as normal students only

 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Nirmala Sitharaman criticized Congress president Sonia Gandhi, accusing her of "misleading" the people over the revised citizenship law and "unfairly" comparing it with the NRC
 bhartiya janata party kii ore se jari bayaan main sitaraman ne pradarshnakariyon se is kanoon ko padhane or jarurat par spashtikaran maangane ke liye kaha
 He also told the protesters to avoid forces that are "misleading" them and spreading "violence and fear" among the country's citizens
 ''sitaraman ne kaha, ''main bharat ke sabhi nagarikon se apil karti hum ki ve is bhram or dar kii sthiti main nahin paden
 The Congress and the parties like Trinamool and AAP and the Left parties are creating fear by adding the revised Citizenship Act and NRC, while the NRC is not even ready yet
 '' unhone kaha, ''main desh ke prayek naagarik se apil karti hum ki hataash ho chuki congress, trikaan, aap or vam dal jo kar rahe hai usase vah prabhavit nahin ho
 The BJP leader said that the revised citizenship law is not meant to take away citizenship of any Indian
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki is kanoon kaa kisi bhartiya naagarik se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 He said, "it is unfortunate that Congress Party's interim president Sonia Gandhi is misleading the people of the country about the amended citizenship law and wrongly linking it to the NRC while the NRC has not even been prepared yet

 Impressed by Virender Sehwag's reckless batting and his 293-run knock against Sri Lanka in Mumbai, the former Australian captain described the India opener as the present-day Don Bradman and said the two have many similarities in their batting
 chapel ke anusaar us jamaane main jabaki anya ballebaaj apni takanic par bharosa karte hai tab sahvaag ‘gend dekho or hit karo’ ke aajamaaye hue formule par chalate hai
 The former Australian captain wrote in his column on a sports website, "sehwag often says that he doesn't think much while batting
 ek chatur vyakti aisa karata he
 In addition to his skill after years of speculation, what was the reason for Sir Donald Bradman becoming great, i have come to the conclusion that he used to bat fearlessly
 ’’unhone kaha, ‘‘sahvaag or breadman main keval yahi samanta nahin he
 These two are the only batsmen who have scored more than 290 runs in Test cricket three times
 unka apni peedi main bade score kaa sarvshereshth strike rate rahaa

 Anand believes that in rural areas of Bihar, where students do not have the facility of blackboard in schools nor have buildings for them, in such a situation, they do not have complete knowledge of computers and the habit of working on computers
 Therefore, the offline option should not be omitted
 anand ne kaha, 'iaiti santhaan advance test ko 2016-17 se puri tarah online karne main jute hai
 Right now this test is completely offline, while the mains exam has both options

 By alerting the country to the possibility of an emergency in the future, he has taken on the dictatorial tendencies of his own leader Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 Chetan understood the pain he experienced while making girls wax
 magar bharat kya, duniya ke kisi bhi desh main aurat kii jindagi se jude kuch behad kadave sach isamen gaayab hai
 Actually, the conscious have become celebrity writers
 ve jo likhte hai us par filmein banati hai, sitare book launch karne aate hai or kitaaben padhakar rote bhi hai
 Kangana cried on her book launch in a similar way
 chetan ne ek video bhi launch kiya, jisamen unhone bataaya ki mahilaon ko vaix karaate hue kitna dard hota he
 How courageous it is to endure this pain every month
 saath main yah bhi ki ve mahilaon kaa kitna aadar karte hai
 Seeing all this, it seems that Chetan has not been able to put the pain of women in words in the right way
 ve asaliyat se koson dur dikhte hai
 i wish if Chetan had looked at these as well, then you would have understood what is the pain - Periods
 So you are a 10-11 year old girl who has had periods
 us umr main senetry napkins kii duniya, ghurti najaron se bachakar bathroom janaa, class main bacchon se khud ko alag mahasoos karnaa or saath main pedu main uthta dard
 The pain, blood loss, dizziness that the child suffers in this process month after month is the real pain
 agle 40 saal ke liye use yah dard har maah sahanaa hota he
 The biggest benefit of pregnancy is the release from Chetan Bhagat

 jon abraham kii film fars se bollywood main debyue karne vaale actor vidyut jamwaal ne apane luks or muscular body se logon ko apana divaana banaaya he
 But have you liked his movies? Do you think anything ahead of Commando 3 when Vidyut Jamwal's name comes somewhere? The answer is no
 film fars se damdaar debyue karne vaale vidyut jamwaal aaj bollywood ke commando ban gaye hai lekin lagata he ki apni image se nikalne kaa unka koi iraadaa nahin he
 After making his debut in 2011, in 2013, Vidyut acted in the film Commando and was then converted into a franchise
 iske baad 2017 main ai commando 2 or ab commando 3 aane ja rahi he
 In between these three films, Vidyut has done only films called Junglee, which neither performed well nor liked at the box office

 His brilliant work in his debut film is proof that Vidyut is a strong actor
 unhone bullate raja or baadshaaho jaisi filmon main chote role bhi kiye hai
 In such a situation, the public wants to see him in a different and better acting role
 vidyut jamwaal badhiya ection karte hai or parde par maar-pitayee main maahir bhi hai
 But will they ever be seen doing anything beyond the Komado franchise? Only time will tell
 bataa den ki saal 2020 khud hafiz or yaara jaisi filmon main kaam kar rahe hai
 Both these films will also be full of action

 ’ Wildlife centuries are for the protection of wild animals, but some dangerous elements do not halt there by disturbing the animals
 gir ke jangal se aisi hi ek tasviir ai he jahaan teen sheron ko kuch log pareshaan karte najar aa rahe hai
 Thankfully, the lions did not retaliate
 gir ke jangal main teen sher apane shikaar ko khaane main mast the
 Seeing the anger of these three, it can be said that whoever comes before him is not well
 teen is kadar gurraa rahe hai ki dushman ko chhodenge nahin
 Three lions together and that too - dreaded and extremely aggressive - which may have never been seen like this
 khabar se saath lage video main aap dekh sakate hai ki teenon sher shikaar kaa lutf uthaane mast hai
 But then people who disturb them in their color are threatened
 pehle to teenon sher samaj nahin pate ki inke ilaake main kadam rakhane kii jurrat aakhir kisne kii
 See in the video, some people are daring and daring to disturb these lions
 sheron kii fouj pehle to gurraa kar dushman ko khabardaar karti he
 But in the face of repeated attempts to drive away, the courage of the lions is betrayed
 darasal gir ke jangalon ko 1965 main wild life centuri ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 Gir, spread over 1412 square kilometers, had 523 Vanraj habitations as of 2015
 is gir main sheron ke aaraam main khalal daalane vaale in logon kii pahchaan honi baaki he lekin mana ja rahaa he ki inamen se ek shaks police vaala he
 The question is how did these people reach the forest so much and how could they stand in front of the lions
 tamilnadu ke tutikorin main chal rahe virodh pradarshan ke bich rajya sarkaar ne sterlite copper vedanta limited ke unit ko hameshaa ke liye band karne kaa aadesh diya he
 After this order, the supply of copper in the country will be affected the most
 desh main tambe kii salanaa jarurat main is plant kii 40 fisadi hissedari thi
 The government can meet this shortfall by importing copper, but it may have to bear a burden of 200 billion rupees every year
 chote kaarobaariyon par asarbharat har saal 10 lakh ton tambe kaa production karata he
 Sterlite plant accounts for 40% of this total production
 is plant ke band hone kii vajah se 800 choti or medium units par asar dekhne ko milegaa
 These units include cable manufacturers, winding wire units and transformer manufacturers, among others
 ye wo unite hai, jo sterlite plant se judi hui thim
 a 2 per cent increase in copper prices, experts say, is bound to affect the supply of copper domestically due to the closure of the Sterlite plant
 adelavis ke camodity analist ankit narsana ne bijness today se baatcheet main bataaya ki plant band hone kaa asar abhi tambe kii keemten badhane ke taur par dikh saktaa he
 Due to this, its prices may increase by 2 percent
 maujuuda samay main bazaar main tamba 455 rupee prati kilogram mil rahaa he
 The government can import, he said, adding that India accounts for 10 percent of the total copper production in the world
 ankit ne kaha ki keemton ko niyantrit karne ke liye iskaa aayaat badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 If this happens, the government may have to bear the cost of 3 billion dollars (about 200 billion rupees) for this
 30 hajaar se bhi zyada logon par padegaa asaratutikorin main jari pradarshan ke dauraan sterlite copper ke siio pi
 Ramnath spoke to Business Today
 isamen unhone bataaya tha ki yahaan 3500 se zyada log kaam karte hai
 Apart from this, there are more than 30 thousand people, who are indirectly connected with the plant
 ye log fertiliser plant ke sulphrik acid or phosphoric acid taiyaar karte hai
 These will directly affect the closure of the plant
 isse in logon ke liye musiibat khadi hogi

 mahangaai ke is daur main har koi amir bananaa chahta he
 But there is no shortcut way to get rich
 iske liye nivesh hi ekmaatr rasta he, jisapar chalakar lakshya hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 But where and how to invest is important
 sahi jagah par nivesh se hi lakshya tak pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 Actually, there is a question in everyone's mind that where to invest hard earned money so that the financial goal is reached
 philhal mutual fund nivesh ke liye behatar vikalp hai
 People have been investing in mutual funds for the last two decades and they have also got better returns
 lambey samay tak SIP par shandaar ritergar koi lambey samay ke liye nivesh karnaa chahta he to unke liye SIP shuru karne ke liye yah acha samay he
 sips should be started at this time for investors who continue to invest for at least 3 to 5 years
 agar koi lagaataar 10 saal tak SIP karata he to wo bada fund jutaney main sakasham rahegaa
 Methods of investing in mutual funds sips in mutual funds can be initiated in three ways
 pehla- mutual fund agent ke jariye
 Second- open an online trading account from a broker and do SIP
 iske alaava teesraa tarika he ki mutual fund ke diarect plan main nivesh karen
 For this, one has to invest by visiting the website of mutual fund companies
 kya he SIPSIP mutual fund main nivesh kaa ek tarika he
 Through this, it becomes easy to get good returns on investing
 mutual fund main nivesh kaa rasta behad aasaan he
 One can invest in any diversified mutual fund through the Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)
 pichley kuch saalon main kai mutual fund main 20 fisadi tak ritern mila he
 If someone does SIP for 2000 rupees for 10 years and gets 12% return on it, then 4
 6 lakh rupee ho jayega
 Start with just 500 rupees
 Investing in SIP mutual funds can start from Rs 500 a month
 yani mutual fund main nivesh ke koi badi rakam kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 However, the investment needs to be continued every month
 mutual fund main nivesh ke liye koi umr nahimuual fund main nivesh ke liye koi umr nahin hoti he
 Financial experts today advise everyone to invest in mutual funds
 kisi bhi umr ke log mutual fund main SIP kar sakate hai
 If invested through SIP for a long time with little risk, then it will prove to be a better option than other investment methods
 lambey samay main mahangaai se sirf mutual fund ke ritern hi lard sakate hai
 However, some mutual funds have not given predictable results
 aise main is fund main niveshkon ko thodi niraashaa jarur hui hogi
 Apart from this, it is the most difficult task for small investors to choose a fund, because it requires a lot of research to choose the right fund
 isliye mutual fund main nivesh se pehle sabhi pahaluon par vichaar kar len, ho sake to kisi vittiya jaankaar se salaah jarur len
 (all Photos: Getty) dilli metro ke purv pramukh or metro main ke naam se mashhoor i shridharan (E
 Sreedharan) has replied to the letter of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia
 shridharan ne kaha ki jab tak dilli metro 33000 karod kaa lone nahin chukaa leti haitab tak meri samaaj ke kisi bhi varg ko muft yatra par aapatti he
 Your government will compensate the loss due to the Metro by free travel to women, but the incoming governments may not be able to do so and then the metro will not change this decision and will not be able to take the travel fare from women
 yah desh kii duusari metro ke liye khatarnaak nazeer banegi
 E
 Sreedharan (E
 Sreedharan) nekaha ki ham desh main bahut dhimi gati se metro kaa nirmaan kar rahe hai
 The metro is built 25 km every year, while 300 km every year in China
 yah sab fund kii kami ke chalate hai
 He wrote, if there are signs of getting stuck in the debt trap in the metro, then the future metro will not get loan
 main aap kii yojana kaa virodh nahin kar rahaa hum keval muft yatra ke concept par aapatti kar rahaa hum
 If women were given free travel, what would happen to other sections of society such as students with disabilities and senior citizens
 jo ki iske zyada hakdaar hai
 No metro in the world offers free travel to women
 agar dilli sarkaar ko mahilaon kii zyada chintaa he to meraa suzav he kii mahilaon ke tikat ko diarectli paisa dekar rimbarskar den
 Keep in mind that whatever compensation the Delhi government is giving to the metro is taxpayer's money and its right to question why only women travel for free? Sreedharan said, "everyone knows that this is an election maneuver, to get the votes of women
" agar dilli sarkaar ke paas bahut zyada paisa aa gaya he to vah kyon nahin dilli metro ko or train kharidne or nai line kaa nirmaan karne ke liye madad karti jisase ki pehle se hi bhari hui metro ko raahat mili
 Whereas according to my information, the Delhi government has delayed the approval of the fourth face of the metro by 2 years
 or last mil connactivity ke liye bas seva bhi nahin laai
 The government should have done this to reduce congestion on the atmosphere and roads, not free travel for women
 shridharan ne aage kaha he kimuft yatra dekar mahila yatriyon kii suraksha bilkul nahin badhegi
 After leaving the metro, what happens if something happens before catching the road bus? Your government should work in this area and not on giving free travel
 main aapaki sarkaar se apil karata hum ki vah chunavi phaayde keliye dilli metro jaise ek sakasham or kaamyaab public transport system ko barbaad naa karen

 'he said,' i think our administrative structure is not right
 vah bhayaavah he or ham kai maukon par galat raah par chale hai
 Lara, who retired after the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies, scored 11,953 runs in 131 Tests
 unhone kaha ki westeindies cricket ko pehle prashasnic dhaanchen main sudhaar karnaa hoga or phir agle paanch yaa das saal main sudhaar karne ke bare main sochna hoga
 He said, 'our board and players' relationships have not been good for many years and we have to improve them first
 hamen apana aadhaar majboot karnaa hoga
 The infrastructure will have to be improved and then think about the next five or ten years

 So no poor will be unemployed anymore! There is so much happiness that you do not get in your mind! But as soon as the figures were skewed, happiness vanished
 kyonki pichley saal ke berogari ke aankade asal tasviir dikhaate hai

 The examination center should be at a distance of 100 kilometers
 admit card jari hone ke baad pre 15 dinon ke bheetar ho janaa chahie

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme on 13 January 2016 during his first term
 is beemaa yojana makasad tha prakritik aapadaaon, keedon ke hamalon yaa aag kii vajah se hue fasali nuksaan kii bharpai karnaa
 But in many states, farmers are now distancing themselves from the scheme
 jaankaar bhi modi sarkaar kii is yojana main khamiyaan ginate rahe hai
 According to a report of Farmers' Aapatindia Today, in Madhya Pradesh, last year, a farmer received a compensation of just Rs 951 on crop insurance for a loss of Rs 20,000
 kisaan kaa kahana tha ki isse zyada to unhone premium diya tha
 At the same time, in Sehore, the home district of former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, in the year 2017, farmers were given compensation of only Rs 4 and Rs 17, while the farmer paid a premium of Rs 1,342
 aisi misaalen desh bhar main mil jaaengi
 As a result, farmers are being disillusioned with the crop insurance scheme
 sarkaar kaa lakshya 2019 ke march tak buaai ke kul rakabe ke kareeb 50 fisadi hisse ko beemaa ke daayre main laana tha
 The reason is that only 30% of the total area sown in 2016-17 was under insurance, but in 2017-18, there was a reduction of about one-fourth of it
 bajet se ummid
 
 
 However, the Modi government seems to be active on the Prime Minister's crop insurance scheme and it is expected that the budget will be able to remove its loopholes
 saath hi iskaa dayera bhi badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 After coming back to power, the Modi government has set a target of 100 days to work on many schemes
 isi ke tahat sarkaar fasal beemaa kaa dayera badhaane ke liye jald hi dakgharon main bhi suvidha shuru karegi
 The Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare says that the availability of this facility in post offices will double the number of farmers taking advantage
 pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana main kisaan ko mahaj 1 se 1
 There is a provision to give premium up to 5 percent only
 baaki premium centre or rajya sarkaar bharti hai
 But the government is not directly connected to crop insurance
 vah iske liye beemaa companiyon se nivida mangati he jo bhavishya main hone vaale nuksaan ke anumaan kii gananaa kar uskaa premium vasuul karti hai
 No documents are given to the cropper of the crop insurance scheme, so that he can prove that he is insured
 nuksaan hone kii sthiti main kisaan ko khud 48 ghante ke andar report karnaa hota he
 Insurance companies are arbitrary for claims
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki kisaanon kii ghatati dilchaspee kaa ek kaaran yah bhi he ki beemaa companiyaan clem ko teji se nahin nipataati hai, kyonki beemaa policy bainkon or beemaa companiyon ke hiton ke hisaab se banaai gai he
 In 2017, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), in its new report, highlighted several shortcomings in the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government's ambitious scheme 'pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana'
 report main kaha gaya tha ki kisaanon ko beemaa raashi muhaiyaa karaane main kii ja rahi deree ke chalate kisaanon ko samay se vittiya madad pradaan karne kaa lakshya baadhit hua
 The CAG said in its report that out of the farmers surveyed, two-thirds (66)
 66 fisadi) kisaanon ko is yojana kii jaankaree hi nahin thi
 It is worth noting that for the last several years, crops are being destroyed due to avidity, hail and storm
 karj lekar khun-paseene bahaakar kheti karne vaale anndaata barbaad ho rahe the
 The Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme has been implemented by the Central Government to prevent loss

 The ongoing tussle between Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan politics came to the fore on Tuesday on the occasion of Rajiv Gandhi Jayanti
 payalat ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ji aap kaaryakartaaon or vidhayakon kii bhi suniye
 The head of the organization said that the organization is above the government
 yahi nahin, rajeev gandhi kaa hawala dete hue payalat ne kaha ki dallalon ko dur karnaa hoga
 In the Congress office in Jaipur, State President Sachin Pilot expressed the pain of Congress leaders and workers in front of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot
 payalat ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ji aap kaaryakarta or vidhayakon kii bhi suniye
 When the MLA takes the work with you, then you should declare it immediately by not saying about making DPR
 rajeev gandhi kaa hawala dete hue payalat ne ishaaron-ishaaron main kaha ki hamen party ko dallalon se dur rakhana chahie
 Pilot said that in the Mumbai session, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had said that if there are brokers in our party, then they have to be pulled out
 payalat ne jab ye baat kahi to pehle gahalot muskaraae magar uske baad wo behad gambhir baithe rahe
 Pilot also told Ashok Gehlot in gestures about the government and the organization that Rajiv Gandhi used to say, always, more organization should be given importance than government
 sarkaar to aati-jaati rahati he, sanghathan ko majboot karne ke liye kaam karnaa chahie
 The sentiments of the workers should be taken care of and work to strengthen the party
 soobe kaa up mukhyamantri or party kaa pradesh adhyaksh jab khule man se mukhyamantri ke saamne yah kahe to saaf he ki party main sab kuch thik-thaak nahin chal rahaa he
 On the occasion of Rajiv Gandhi Jayanti, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot was telling the workers in the state Congress office how Rajiv Gandhi cared about the state and listened to the leaders
 yah bataate-bataate ashok gahalot ne kaha ki jab rajasthan main akaal aayaa tha to rajeev gandhi ne hamaari suni thi or pani ke project ko indira gandhi canal se jodne kii baat maani thi
 During the famine, all the work was done by monitoring himself
 darasal, gahalot yah bataa rahe the ki mukhyamantri us vakt rajasthan ke shivacharan maathur the lekin jab nahar kii jarurat ke bare main unhone rajeev gandhi ko bataaya to rajeev ne sandesh bhijwaya ki jab vah stage par bolne jaaen to ashok se kahana ki yah baat mujhe yaad dilaae
 i will announce this on stage
 yah dikhaata he ki rajeev gandhi apane kaaryakartaaon kaa kitna khyaal rakhte the
 After this, it was Sachin Pilot's turn to speak as the state president
 unhone saaf-saaf bina kisi laag lapet ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot se kaha ki rajeev gandhi ne aapaki suni thi to usee tarah aap bhi pradesh ke kaaryakartaaon or vidhayakon kii baat maniye

 YSR Congress President YS Jaganmohan Reddy's 29 mlas in Andhra Pradesh have resigned
 inamen congress, telugu desham party (tedepa) or praja rajyam party (piarpy) ke vidhayak bhi hai
 It is alleged that the state government is trying to tarnish the image of former Chief Minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy

 Assembly Speaker N
 manohar ke guntur jile ke daure par hone kii vajah se unhone apana istipha sadan ke sachiv raja sadaram ko saunp diya
 Those who resigned include 26 from Congress, two from TDP and one from the PRP
 vidhansabha pahunchane se pehle congress ke sabhi 26 vidhayakon ne party kii praathmik sadsyta se istipha de diya
 He sent his resignation via fax to the Congress headquarters at Gandhi Bhavan
 yaheen piarpy ke congress main aupchaarik vilay ke liye samaaroh kaa aayojan kiya ja rahaa he
 Congress MLA P
 subhash chandra bose ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki purv mukhyamantri rajasekhar reddy kii chhavi ko dhoomil karne ke rajya sarkaar kii koshish ke virodh main unhone istipha diya he
 It is noteworthy that in the FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the case of investigation of illegal property against Jaganmohan, the name of the late Chief Minister is also there
 bengal ke panchayat chunaav sharmasaar karne vaale hai
 Voting did not start that bomb gunfire started in many places in the morning
 aam taur par dopaher baad hinsa hoti thi magar subah hi hinsa hone lagi
 There has been violence near the polling booth, near the police station
 bam chale hai or goli chali he
 Know how many places the fight took place
 bijepi kaaryakarta kii goli maar kar hatya hui he
 a Trinamool worker was also killed
 sipiem kaaryakarta kaa ghar phoonk diya gaya
 His wife also died of burns
 chunaav se pehle hi hinsa hone lagi thi
 After that, what was the preparation that such violence has happened? media report ke anusaar saat se lekar 13 logon ke marane kii khabar aa rahi he
 The number of injured is being reported in hundreds
 tivi ke footage main koi talwaar lekar ja rahaa he to koi cheharaa chhipaae ja rahaa he
 Losing and winning in the panchayat elections on this condition is of no use
 rajya chunaav ayog ko chunaav hi radd kar dena chahie
 Elections in many states in India have become violence-free
 vahaan baahubal kii jagah ghanabal ne le liya he
 But the character of politics has become violence in Bengal
 kisi ko jagah banani hoti he to ramanavami main talavaaron kii yatra nikaalata he, tanaav paidaa karata he, kisi ko apni jagah bachaani he to wo bhi talavaarein nikaalte hai
 Workers of every party are being killed in this violence
 bengal ke gaanv agar isi tarah hinsa ko sweekaar karte rahe or shahar beparwaah rahe to ek din vahaan chunaav or jeetne kaa koi matlab nahin rah jayega
 The details of the violence are telling that Bengal is still living in the political era of the 80s
 tippaniyan Even before the election, the opposition could not field candidates in a third of the seats
 jabaki vipaksh main kai partiyaan hai
 BJP, Congress, CPM, other parties of Left
 agar ye sab milakar ek tihaai siton par bhay or hinsa ke kaaran ummidavaar na utaar paaen to phir is chunaav ko karana hi nahin chahie tha
 What is this message conveying? Somebody is comparing the figures of violence during the Left with the low this time
 yah tulana hi sharmnaak he
 The question is why violence is still being given place today
 zimmedaari trinmul kii banati he
 Neither BJP nor CPM can escape accountability
 bengal kaa sach yahi he
 Everyone needs violence
 hinsa hi rasta he satta tak pahunchane kaa
 There should have been only one option in this situation
 bengal main har haal main chunaav hinsa mukt hona chahie tha
 If an election officer has to beg in front of the police to save his life, this scene is terrible
 hinsa mukt chunaav na karaane ke liye chunaav vyavastha main lage sabhi ko dandit kiya janaa chahie
 Should be dismissed and the election canceled
 kisi bhi surat main hinsa se koi samjhauta nahin
 Otherwise, democracy will only be with those who have either a sword in their hand or who have a crowd armed with bigotry
 bharat main kai rajyon main chunaav hinsa mukt ho gaye hai
 There Ghanbal has replaced Bahubal
 magar bengal main raajnneeti kaa charitra hi hinsa ho gai he
 If someone wants to make a place, then in Ramnavami, the journey of swords takes place, creates tension, if someone wants to save their place, they also take out swords
 is hinsa main har dal ke kaaryakarta maare ja rahe hai
 If the villages of Bengal continue to accept violence in a similar manner and the city remains uninterested, then one day there will be no point in winning elections
 hinsa ke detail bataa rahe hai ki bengal abhi bhi 80 ke dashak ke raajnneetik yug main ji rahaa he
 The comments chunaav se pehle hi vipaksh ek tihaai siton par ummidavaar khadey nahin kar paaya
 While there are many parties in the opposition
 bijepi, congress, sipiem, left kii anya partiyaan
 If all these together could not field candidates in one-third seats due to fear and violence, then this election should not have been held
 yah kya sandesh de rahaa he? koi vamadalon ke samay hone vaali hinsa ke aankadon se tulana kar rahaa he ki is baar kam he
 This comparison itself is embarrassing
 sawaal he ki aaj bhi hinsa ko kyon jagah mil rahi he
 The responsibility belongs to the Trinamool
 javabdehi se bijepi or sipiem bhi nahin batch sakati he
 This is the truth of Bengal
 sabko hinsa chahie
 Violence is the only way to reach power
