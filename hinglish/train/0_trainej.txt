 The Petroleum Ministry is under increasing pressure on the question of limiting the number of subsidized LPG cylinders for domestic customers
 sutron ne enditivi ko bataaya ki petroleum mantralay main is prastaav par gambhir charchaa hui he ki riyayati silendaron kii sankhya par pabandi hataai jaae or uski jagah unki keemten badhaane par vichaar kiya jaae
 According to the information, reducing the number of subsidized cylinders to six will save only Rs 5300 crore, while the political loss to the government will be much greater
 aise main is rakam ko bachaane kaa doosraa jariya talasha janaa chahie
 The comments petroleum mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik, kul rasoi gas upabhoktaaon main se sirf 44 fisadi parivaar hi aise hai, jo chah yaa usase kam alpiji silendaron kaa istemaal karte hai
 If the total data is examined in depth, then 29 percent of the total consumers use four or less LPG cylinders, while 38 percent households use five or less
 ab, chah se kam silendar istemaal karne waalon ke in aankadon ke hisaab se dekha jaae, to kul 14 karod alpiji upabhoktaaon main se 56 fisadi, yani, saat karod 84 lakh upabhoktaaon par is pabandi kaa asar padegaa, or unki naaraazgi upie ko loksabhaa chunaav main kaaphi mahangi pad sakati he
 The pressure on the Petroleum Ministry is increasing at a time when the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are advocating a cut in government spending
 ab dekhnaa hoga kii sarkaar is masale par aage kya faisla karti he
 Sources told NDTV that there has been a serious discussion in the Petroleum Ministry on the proposal to lift the ban on the number of subsidized cylinders and instead consider raising their prices
 jaankaree ke mutabik, riyayati silendaron kii sankhya chah karne se sirf 5300 karod rupee kii bachat hogi jabaki sarkaar ko isse hone vaala raajnneetik nuksaan kahin bada hoga
 In such a situation, another way of saving this amount should be searched

 yadi kul aankadon kii gaharaai se padtaal kii jaae to kul upabhoktaaon main 29 fisadi parivaar to chaar yaa usase bhi kam alpiji silendaron kaa istemaal karte hai, jabaki 38 pratishat parivaar paanch yaa usase kam

 Can be quite expensive

 deepika padukon, ranvir singh or shahid kapur starer film 'padmavat' isi saal 25 janvari ko relies hui thi
 Directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the film was based on 15th century poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi's epic 'padmavat'
 yah film chittorgarh kii rani padmavati ke bare main thi jisane allaudin khilji ke haathon main jane kii bajaae johar (khud ko jivit jala dena) kaa chunaav kiya
 Bhansali wanted to make Padmavat with aishwarya-salman, not deepika-ranveer
 Some critics criticized the Rajputs in the film for their outrage and portraying Muslims as overly cruel
 haalanki baavjood iske kamai ke maamle main film box offis par 300 karod se zyada kaa aankada paar kar gai
 Deepika Padukone did not have much role in the first half of the film
 unhen second half main hi zyada dikhaaya gaya or unke apiyarence ke liye unki khub tarifen huin
 So didn't Priyanka Chopra say Salman's Bharat for this Hollywood film? Deepika Padukone was not director Sanjay Leela Bhansali's first choice for the role of Rani Padmavati
 ek intervyuu ke dauraan aishwarya ne is raaj par se pardaa uthaaya
 Aishwarya told, "we were going to work together in Bajirao Mastani but he couldn't find Bajirao for me
 vah chaahate the ki main padmavat main kaam karun, lekin casting ke vakt unhen mere hisaab kaa khilji nahin mila
 So things could not happen like this
 mujhe unke saath dobaaraa kaam karne main khushi hogi
 "for the first time, Katrina said, at the last moment, Salman's Bharat Aishwarya told," Finally you have to see the casting
 yadi casting hoti he to kai baar chizon main saamanjasy nahin baithta
 The effort was to reconcile but it did not happen

 "according to reports, Sanjay Leela Bhansali also wanted to cast Aishwarya Rai in the film Bajirao Mastani

 However, when it comes to box office, Deepika has always proved herself
 deepika is vakt box offis kii queen hai
 In 25 years of Aishwarya's career, she has given more flops than hits
 aisa shaayad isliye bhi he kyonki unhone hameshaa kamjor script vaali filmon kaa chunaav kiya
 However, it can also not be denied that Aishwarya has proved her performance in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Devdas, Pravokd, Jodha Akbar and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil

 bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi showed how to do this, understand in 10 points
 1
 The strong and reliable PM face BJP won half the battle by making Narendra Modi the PM candidate
 modi kii chhavi bhartiya matadaataaon kii har kasuti par khari utari
 Developer, wearing a cap of appeasement, staying away from politics and talking about strong leadership and results, Narendra Modi has succeeded in convincing voters of every caste, class and region in the country that the 21st century will be India's Can make 2
 All the anti-secularism including Dikkaracongress was talking about the development and the core secularism
 team modi iske ulat yuvaaon ko rojgaar, desh kaa vikaas, infrastracchar kii baat, karpshan main kami jaise asal muddon par focusd rahe
 He made it clear to the voters that the opponents are avoiding talking about the real issues and problems in the name of saving poverty and sometimes saving secularism

 The right alliance: The bjp's Atal Bihari Vajpayee government lost elections in 2004 as its coalition partners like Trinamool Congress, Telugu Desam Party, JDU, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal and AIADMK were defeated
 bijepi kii sankhya bhi kaaphi giri
 Keeping this lesson in mind, BJP took 24 parties together and under the leadership of Narendra Modi weaved a new National Democratic Alliance
 modi ke naam par samjhauta nahin kiya or bihar main jediu jaise puraane sahyogi ke virodh ko darkinar kar diya
 The logic of the local party leadership also called the Assam Gana Parishad in Assam a good boy
 hawa kaa rukh to usee din saaf ho gaya tha, jab secularism ke mudde par atal sarkaar se alag hue algepi ke ramvilas paswan waapas endie main laute
 Apart from this, BJP also took up Bharatiya Lok Samata Party of Upinder Kushwaha to bring out the air of Nitish Kumar and Lalu in Bihar

 modi apni reliyon main congress ke kushasan par joardaar hamalaa karte dikhe
 Time and again the election was dragged on the issue of development and it was assured of its credibility by citing BJP ruled states and the Atal government
 5
 The election of the right candidates was a wave of moderation, but to get it to the ground, the selection of the right candidates was also necessary
 bijepi ne apane har bade naam ko morche par utaara
 For example, in Uttarakhand, three former Chief Ministers BC Khanduri, Bhagat Singh Koshari and Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank fielded
 isi tarah uttar pradesh main rajnath singh, calraj mishra, murali manohar joshi, santosh gangavar jaise old guard maidan main utaare
 Along with this, new party like General VK Singh and Satyapal Singh and those who have entered their professional life, also gave party tickets
 dilli main aam aadmi party kii chunauti ko sweekaar karte hue mahesh giri se nae to harshavardhan se manje chehre saamne rakhe
 Worked on a clean sweep in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat where BJP is in power

 The party won entire seats in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Uttarakhand

" khud ko garib kaa betaa bataa shahjade rahul gandhi ko chunauti di
 When Priyanka Gandhi called low politics, she redeemed her OBC card fiercely and made the Congress stand in the dock
 virodhiyon ne musalamaanon ko dar dikhaa secularism kii baat kii, to modi ne is daawey kii hi hawa nikaal di
 8
 team bijepi kaa sangyojan or aresas kaa ballpold guard kii shuruaati kunmunaahat ko darkinar kar narendra modi ne rajnath singh, arun jetali, nitin gadakari or amit shah kii nai team khadi kar lee
 Held the Chief Ministers of all BJP ruled states and gave them complete freedom to choose candidates in the state
 vasundhara raaje adin to rajasthan main jaswant singh jaise old guard ko kinare laga diya
 bjp's parent organization RSS also gave full support to BJP at every possible level under the leadership of Mohan Bhagwat
 9
 The public's resentment towards the Congress was irked by the 10-year rule of the Congress
 upie 2 ke dauraan 2ji ghotaale or koyala ghotaale se jo gandh bikharani shuru hui
 He filled the public with despair
 kharaab aarthik haalat, rahul gandhi ke prernahin netritv ne bijepi kii madad kii
 The BJP successfully assured the country that only it can get rid of the misrule of the Congress and if the votes were spoiled by giving the vote to the regional parties, then the Congress would again become the axis of power
 10
 Modi's hard work and last but most important thing
 gujarat ke teen baar ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne is chunaav main anathak mehnat kii
 Campaigned all over the country without stopping
 unki team ne soshal cites se lekar booth management tak har jagah ek hi massej bhijwaya
 Vote not to local candidates but to Narendra Modi
 abaki baar modi sarkaar desh kaa naaraa ban gaya or ab ye hakeekat he
 If you listen with ear, you will hear the echo of Modi in the air
 or jab jab ye shor uthaa, modi ne sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii baat kar apane sapane ko sabakaa sapana bana diya

 In the rain, the terror of cattle increases, during the rainy days, in Madhya Pradesh, cattle leave the wet land and sit on the streets
 inase naa keval maweshiyon kii jaan ko khatra hota he, balki durghatana hone kii sambhaavnaaen bhi kai guna bad jaati hai
 During the rains, there is no state or national highway in Madhya Pradesh where herds of cattle do not come and sit
 sadakon par maweshiyon kaa jhund durghatnaon ko nimantran detaa he or kai baar inaki vajah se gambhir durghatnaayen hoti hai jisamen logon kii jaan tak chali jaati he

 Has been yahi vajah he ki madhya pradesh ke zyaadaatar haive or sadakon par aawaara maweshiyon kaa kabja pehle kii tarah barkaraar he

 prasad ne kaha, kuch muddon par samjhauta nahin kiya ja saktaa or bhrashtachar aisa hi ek mudda he
 He said, since 1989, the party that wins in Karnataka loses in the Lok Sabha
 isliye mujhe bharosa he ki ham loksabhaa chunaav main jeetenge
 BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said, "we must have had some shortcomings"

 apni jindagi ke bees saal maine nirvasit hokar bahut-se deshon main gujaarey hai
 Life was different in every country
 bharat kaa jivan europe-america se bilkul alag he
 Many times in this country the value of my head was imposed, i was physically assaulted, my books banned; All types of government, non-government people disliked my writings and sued me, i was expelled from the state and even once in the country
 or vahiin iske ulat isi desh main mere pathakon kii sankhya bahut zyada he
 The people of this country love me in the same way they want to kill me
 jo log mujhe pyaar karte hai, ve bahut saadhaaran log hai
 The more joy there is in this country, the more fear is there
 pashchim main kuch bhi nahin he, na anand or na dar
 Someone asked me, why do i live in this country after taking so much risk? i replied, "because i know the name of all the plants here
" ‚Äô‚Äôitani ghrinaa pai he, itane aghat, iske baavjood yah desh bahut apana lagata he
 Many people ask me how i spend the day? Days pass
 hajaaron kaam hai, karne kaa samay hi nahin he
 If i read something then i am left writing, and if i write, i am left studying
 jindagi bhar itani kitaaben kharidi hai, unhen kab padhungi? yah sochakar hi sihar uthati hum
 This is not possible in one life
 jaanati hum mar jaaoongi ek din, phir bhi jeene kii bahut chaah he
 How much will happen in the world-universe and i will not be able to see all that
 yahaan bharat main ghar main baithkar likhnaa-padhuya hi meraa mul kaam he
 In Europe and America, everything had to be done on its own
 yahaan to phir bhi ghar ponchney, bartan dhone aadi ke liye madad mil jaati he
 This gives more time for reading and writing
 lekin har samay to likhane-padhgaye kaa bhi man nahin karata
 There is no place to go anywhere outside the house
 aisa to he nahin ki sadak par chaluungi or fefdon main shuddh hawa bharungi, broadway musical dekhuungi, linkan centre jaaoongi, kisi behtareen cafe main baithungi or kisi bahut badhibia restaraan main khaanaa khaauungi
 The air outside here is contaminated, there is no way to move
 bahut baar nikali hum to langs main infections ho jaataa he
 i mostly go outside India
 akasar vibhinn kaaryakramon main vaktavy dene europe-america jaati hum
 Invitations are received basically to speak on the topics of humanity, women's freedom, etc
 bahut dinon se kahin koi kavita nahin padhi
 All this happened a lot during my stay in Bengal
 kavita din-par-din jivan se dur hoti ja rahi he
 Another difference from abroad is that of fish
 videsh main barf main rakhi desi machhliyaan kharidni padati thim or yahaan taaji
 Bengalis do not work without fish and rice
 akasar hi bengali machhlee kharidne jaati hum
 Delhi is not like Calcutta
 dilli ke bengali ilaake ko kalkatte kaa maniktala yaa gadipahaat samajhane se nishchit hi bhul hogi
 i buy a lot of fish at once and keep them in the fridge and then eat them slowly
 kuch log hote hai, jo dusron ko khilaanaa pasand karte hai, main unamem se ek hum
 When i was in Calcutta, the doors of my house were open to everyone
 yah aatithy-satkar kisase siikhaa tha maine? nishchit hi apni maa se
 Many people think that since my family is not of husband and children, i will feel very lonely
 main akeli rahati hum par iskaa matlab yah nahin ki main akelepan se peedit hum
 People do not understand even after explaining this to me thousands of times
 main likhti hum, padhati hum, sochati hum or in sab baton ko lekar vyast rahati hum
 She keeps all these? That too "womanly"? What is this? The work of reading and writing means the work of wisdom
 yah to purushon ko hi janchataa he
 This work is not for women
 main likh rahi hum, pard rahi hum, soch rahi hum, yah logon ko utana mugdh nahin karata he, jitna ki ‚Äò‚Äòmain khaanaa bana rahi hum‚Äô‚Äô karata he
 Till now it is believed that cooking is the biggest talent of women
 main akasar khaanaa pakaati hum
 Especially when good fish is found
 maance-machhlee khaati hunjarur, lekin saag-subjiyan bhi bahut pasand hai
 Vegetarians eat more than they eat
 khud hi jaakar subjiyan kharidti hum
 To be fair, the fish seller, vegetable seller, tea seller are all my friends in this city
 kalakatta main bhi aisa hi tha
 These people surround me as Didi, Didi
 asal main desh-videsh sab jagah saadhaaran log hi mere dost hote hai
 i am not made by big people
 dilli-kalakatta main bahut partiyaan hoti hai
 Some people had invited me to parties in Calcutta, but went and looked, did not like it
 party-varty mere liye nahin he
 i am in favor of leaving early and arriving early
 lekin log der raat partiyon main jate hai, sharaab pite hai or kha-pikar lautate-lautate subah kar dete hai
 i do not drink alcohol sharaabiyon ke saath buddhiheen baaten karnaa mujhe pasand nahin
 i am not invited to any party in Delhi
 bade logon ke gharon main angreji bolne vaale elite varg kii partiyon main main shobhaa nahin detii
 i also do not fit in with the middle class people because my mindset does not match them either
 darasal main kisi bhi shrenee main feet nahin baithti kyonki main shrenee yaa varg jaisi cheez ko pasand hi nahin karti
 i do not have any class character
 main shreniyon se baahar kii insaan hum
 If i am a person outside of religion, a person outside of malevolent culture, then naturally i am a person outside the society
 vaise is tarah jinda rahanaa aasaan nahin par har din yah kathin kaam karti ja rahi hum
 How far am i from my country? bengal se dur hum
 No relatives, no friends
 har samay likhte rahanaa bhi acha nahin lagata
 My cat lives with me
 kabhi-kabhi lagata he ki insaan se billi hi behatar he
 But then suddenly i feel like meeting people too
 par kisi se bhi nahin, achche, danishmand logon se, jinke saath kisi vishay par baat kii ja sake
 But where are such people? Most of the people are either believers in religion or are mischievous
 narivirohi, purushatantric yaa phir swaarthee or kupamandu
 It is better to write or read or tweet than to waste time with such people
 twitor par budhimaan logon ke saath vichaaron kaa aadan-pradaan hota he
 i have noticed that it is better to waste time talking to the useless people around here and stay connected with social networks
 thode samay main duniya kii khabaron ko lekar tarah-tarah ke logon ke vichaar jane ja sakate hai
 Your views can also be stated
 koi sensorship nahin he
 Twitter, Facebook and blogs are very important for me because my writing is often forbidden 
 zyaadaatar vibhinn vishyon par mere vichaar or logon se alag hote hai, jise prakashit karne ke liye mere paas koi jariya nahin he
 Nobody wants to print my writing out of fear
 unhen dar he ki sarkaar naaraaz ho jaaegi, kyonki sarkaar har vakt muslim kattarpathiyon ko khush karnaa chaahati he, kyonki ve mujhe dushman samajhte hai
 In English, i write a blog called "no Country for Women" and in Bengali under the name "muktachinta"
 patrikaon main likhte vakt mujhe yah kahkar satark kiya jaataa he ki dharm kaa ‚Äòdha‚Äô bhi nahin hona chahie
 i tweet almost every day, write blogs, write two-three articles, sometimes poems and sometimes stories
 kuch dinon main ek nayaa upanyaas shuru kar rahi hum
 In this way, the days are cut and the nights are cut
 raaton ko jagakar likhane kaa abhyaas bad gaya he
 a few days ago there was talk of a Megaceryl written in West Bengal
 lekin sarkaar ne dhamkee di ki agar tivi channel is serial kaa prachaar karata he to sarvanaash ho jayega
 Now the channel is not showing it out of fear
 kabhi-kabhi sochati hum ki main takreeban 40 kitaaben likh chuki hum
 Enough happened
 bas ab duniya ke raaston par nikal paduun
 The rest of my life, sitting in the house while writing, suddenly died someday! Haven't seen much yet
 vah sab dekhe bagaiyr marane kii soch bhi nahin paati
 i have no country, no home
 dusron ke flats main rahati hum
 Someday anyone will kill or the government will expel
 jivan main kuch nishchit nahin he
 No more! Wherever i live, in whatever country, i will write my mind
 is ek jivan main bahut-se puraskaar mili
 Got lots of love and respect
 or kuch nahin chahie
 Whatever hatred found, it has been found only to say good things
 dharmik kattarpanthi or nari virdohi apshaktiyon se ghrinaa paanaa ek bahut bada puraskaar he
 There is no way to go out of Delhi
 choubison ghante police kaa paharaa he
 i am grateful to the Government of India for this security system
 jab ghar se nikalne kaa man karata he to dilli main hi gum-phir leti hum
 The most fun is to feed bananas to monkeys on the streets of Janpath
 sadak par bhikhaariyon ko dekhakar bahut dukh hota he
 i give them money
 par mere rupayon se kya unki durdasha kam hogi? mujhe fansy shopping centre bilkul pasand nahin
 Not even fancy things
 kapade-late, juute kharidne kii jarurat padane par sarojini nagar market jaati hum or vahiin se jarurat kii chijen saste main kharidti hum
 i have always stayed away from expensive and designer things
 is shahar main rahati hum, lekin shahar yaa desh ab mere liye sirf eent, lakdi yaa pathar kaa ghar nahin he
 The country means people to me, people who love me, people i love
 kalakatta kaa meraa gharghar tum kaise ho?kya akele ho khub?main bhi khub akeli, main bhi toder nahin lagata raat main? 
 
 
 
 
 You find me, you take the voice of the feet in the darkness, recognize? Take care of the house, everything in my writing room is something that has to be written in life
 
 
 
 How can i leave all this and stay well! In my mind, we will let my eyes fall into the abandoned doors, give water to the waterless plants, no one else will be saved from the water of the eyes
 So, you will send a sea-like home to you, except you do not think a single moment in exile
 pita ko patrababa kaise ho tum?kya pehle kii tarah ab bhisaiyr karne nikalate ho brahmaputra ke kinare?ab jabaki pani hi nahin bachaatab tum brahmaputra main kya dekhte ho?
 
 
 
 
 Do those people still move towards you? Friend? Or two-four neighbors? Or you have to walk in the crime of exposing this seditious girl, bowing her head in the guise of tree-plants, escaping the sight of people
 
 
 
 
 tumhaare liye bada dukh hota he mujhe

 Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said, 'we will not compromise on our self-esteem
 hamane aaj party adhyaksh uddhav thakare se mulaakaat kii or gathbandhan par charchaa kii
 Shiv Sena does not accept anyone's ultimatum

 Several Shiv Sena leaders including Gajanan Kirtikar, Sanjay Raut, Ramdas Kadam, Subhash Desai and Diwakar Raute were present in the meeting

 Actually, the trio of these three actors is extremely popular in Bhojpuri cinema
 ravi kishan jonpur yaa phir yogi adityanath ke kaaryakshetra gorakhpur se chunaav lard sakate hai to bhojpuri super star or abhinayta nirahua azamgarh se chunaav lard rahe hai
 Let me tell you, Bhojpuri film star Dinesh Lal Yadav has also created his new Twitter account to play political innings after entry in BJP
 jatigat samikarnon kii baat karen, to jahaan ravi kishan or manoj tiwari brahman hai, vahiin nirahua yadav hai

 pichhali baar bhaajapa ke pratyaashee rahe ramakant yadav ne sapa supreme mulaayam singh yadav ko kadi takkar di thi
 In such a situation, the bright stars of Bhojpuri cinema will be able to bring the light of their seats to the BJP

 So far in 2018, three tigers have died in Sariska
 inamen se 2 baaghon kaa shikaar kiya gaya jabaki ek baagh asti 4 aapasi ladaai main ghayal hone ke 27 din baad mar gaya
 According to Deputy Conservator Hemant Singh, there was a fight between ST-4 and ST-6 at the Sariska Tiger Reserve on November 13, in which ST-4 was seriously injured
 jiskaa ek ancloger main ilaaj chal rahaa tha lekin baagh ke swasthya main koi sudhaar nahin hua
 Actually, this is not the first incident of a tiger dying

 The tiger, who was undergoing treatment for a long time and died on Sunday, has undergone a postmortem
 sariska ke adhikariyon ne bataaya kighayal baghashikaar nahin kar paa rahaa tha or use chalane main pareshaani ho rahi thi
 The tiger could have been at risk of septicemia
 vanya jeev visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki baagh ke wo ghaav zyada khatarnaak ho jate hai, jinhen wo apni jeebh se nahin chaat saktaa, kyonki baagh prajati main sabase jaldi magnets prabhavi hote hai
 Donald Trump, a possible Republican candidate for the presidency in the US, says he made 'a lot of money' in a deal with Moammar Gaddafi years ago
 haalanki us samay unhen yah pataa nahin tha ki purv libian taanashaah neuyork main apni sampatti kiraye par dene main shaamil tha

" vah is desh aae or unhen mujhase ek sauda karnaa tha, kyonki unhen thaharne ke liye ek jagah kii jarurat thi

 ranneetiyon or planning ke saath baithkon or reliyon kaa daur bhi shuru hone laga he
 At the same time, the battle between the future of NDA in Bihar seems to be quite interesting
 yahi vajah he ki bihar kii siyaasi ahmiyat bhi badhati ja rahi he
 Bihar has a total of 40 Lok Sabha seats
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main in 40 siton main se endie ko kul 31 siton par jeet hasil hui thi
 Of the 31 seats in the NDA, BJP won 22, LJP 6 and RLSP 3
 us chunaav main nitish kumaar kii jediu akele chunavi samar main utari thi, jisamen use mahaj 2 siten hasil ho pai thi
 From 2014 to 2018, there has been a lot of change in the politics of the country
 vipakshi dalon ko bijepi ke vidhansabha chunaavon main badhate prabhaav se apane vajood bachaane kii chintaa sataane lagi he to sahyogi dal bhi 4 saalon ke bijepi ke saath khattey-mithe anubhavon ke maddenjar ab apane faislon par punarvichaar karne lage hai
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, many BJP allies in the NDA have started quitting one by one
 tidipi, jithan ram maanjhi kii 'ham' or pidipi endie se baahar nikal chuki hai
 At the same time, Shiv Sena has increased the difficulties of NDA by announcing to contest separate elections in 2019
 akali dal ne bhi rajya sabha ke upasabhapati pad par daavedaari thok kar bijepi kii mushkilon ko badhaane kaa kaam kiya he
 JDU, the ally in pressure-making jdubihar, has not left any chance to pressurize the BJP after the by-election defeat
 bihar ko vishesh darje kii maang ho yaa assam naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak samet purvottar ke mudde hon, kisaanon kaa mudda ho yaa mahangaai or petrol-dijal kii badhati keemten in sabhi muddon par jediu ne bijepi se alag stand liya he
 Apart from this, the JDU has also supported the Aam Aadmi Party movement demanding full statehood to Delhi
 matlab saaf he jediu loksabhaa chunaavon main apane hisse kii siton kii sankhya or siton ke naamon ko tay karne main ab or zyada intjaar nahin karnaa chaahati he
 Perhaps this is the reason why BJP President Amit Shah has decided to meet Nitish Kumar in Patna on July 12
 jediu kii demand!sutron kii maane to 2019 ke aam chunaav main jediu 15-16 loksabhaa siten chaahati he
 JDU also wants 4-5 seats from UP and Jharkhand
 siyaasi galiyaaron main jediu ke argedy or congress netaaon ke saath andarkhaane baatcheet kii khabaren bhi surkhiyon main hai
 Politicians are considering it as part of jdu's pressure politics
 prashanth kishor kii bhoomika kii bhi charchaa ho rahi he jo samay-samay par parde ke peeche nitish kumaar kii siyaasi ahmiyat ko badhaane kii stritji taiyaar kar rahe hai
 Today Nitish's meeting with Paswan Nitish Kumar is also trying to put political meteorologist Ram Vilas Paswan in his court as a strategy to keep the pressure on the BJP
 8 july ko jediu kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak he
 Before this meeting, Nitish Kumar will meet Ram Vilas Paswan in Delhi today
 mana ja rahaa he ki is baithak main 12 july ko amit shah se mulaakaat ke dauraan seat shering ko lekar kaise dabaav banaaya jaae isaki ranneeti tay hogi
 However, on the other hand Ram Vilas Paswan is also predicting Narendra Modi to hold the post of PM till 2024
 sahyogiyon ko ekajute rakhana bijepi kii siyaasi majaburi he
 In 2013, Nitish Kumar announced the war against PM Modi at the JDU National Executive meeting in Delhi itself
 aise main bijepi or endie ke duusare ghatak dalon kii najar dilli main ho rahi jediu kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak par tik gai he
 Nitish Kumar's speech in the meeting will also reveal his future political decisions

 Under the leadership of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the ruling BJP was repeatedly citing factionalism within the Congress in its election campaign
 congressi halkon main 42 varshiya sindhiya ke netritv main vidhansabha chunaav lade jane kii sambhaavnaaon ko lekar salbhar pehle se charchaa thi

 At the gallop, at some places, Raman's popularity in the politics of the pilgrimage is entangled in the BJP and the Congress is embroiled in the discord, the Raman Singh-led BJP government in Chhattisgarh is trying to impose a hat-trick and the Congress is trying to shed water on its intentions
 mukhyamantri apni vikaas yatra ke jariye uplabdhiyaan gina rahe hai, vahiin khemon main banty congress ne apane netaaon kii maut par ubhari sahanubhuti ko ganvaa diya he

 This time the BJP has strengthened its position a bit by adding the family of Bastar to its camp
 mukhyamantri raman singh kii sabhaaon main umad rahi bheed ne unki lokapriyata kaa graph badhaayaa he
 The biggest factor of bjp's strategy is not to have any resentment towards the Chief Minister

 inputah bhashaa Recently a group of psychoanalysts, including Salman Akhtar, Ashish Nandy and Sudhir Kakkar, were also well known psychoanalysts from all over the world, gathered at the Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurgaon
 ve yahaan manovishleshan par ek kam prachaarit sammelan ke liye aae the, jiskaa yah doosraa saal tha
 Psychoanalysis is a mode that is struggling to maintain its status in the Western world
 lekin in dinon isaki utpatti se doordaraj kii jagahon par isaki maang main baari oochaal aayaa he or ye jagahen hai beijing or dilli
 Last year, the International Psychoanalytic Association celebrated the Asian tigers of psychoanalysis ‚Äî China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and India ‚Äî in a book
 is kitaab main bataaya gaya tha ki sigmund frid ne mushkil se 100 saal pehle jise 'talking kyor' yani baatcheet se nidaan kaha tha, purab ke deshon main vah kis tarah jabardast takat ban gaya he
 Of these five, India is the only country with a long history of psychoanalysis
 yahaan yah vidha utani hi pracheen he, jitani pashchim main he
 The father of Indian psychoanalysis, Girindra Shekhar Bose (1887‚Äì1953) was a contemporary of Freud
 bhartiya manovishleshak sosayadi ne international psycoenelytic association kii manjuuri 1922 main hi hasil kar lee thi
 Many years before European countries like France, which obtained this approval in 1926
 or baaki asian deshon se kai dashak pehle, masalan china se, jahaan manovishleshan kaa itihaas mahaj 13 saal purana he
 Despite the existence of psychoanalysis since Freud's time in India, much remains to be done in this field
 argentina sareekhe deshon main manovishleshan kii is kadar tarakkee hui he ki vahaan apana nijee manochikitsak rakhana aam baat maani jaati he
 On the contrary, most of the Indians here are still shy and hesitant to go to a psychiatrist
 hakeekat yah he ki manochikitsa hindustaniyon ke liye ab bhi pareshaan kar dene vaala vishay he
 Until recently, collective and family harmony and harmony have been our most influential cultural ideals and discussing personal problems has been the equivalent of going on a picnic with stale food items
 yahi nahin, bhartiya samskruti main gungan yaa mahimamandan kii puraane jamaane se chali aa rahi parampara rahi he, jisamen har mukammal cheez ko mahaan or devtaa bana diya jaataa he
 This means that one feels ashamed to accept a less-than-ideal family situation or state of mind
 pocket se paisa kharch karke us par vistaar se charchaa karne kii to baat hi chhod den
 It is as if we want to keep alive our common misconception of the unsuspecting nature of spiritual people
 phir chaahe avsaad ke vyapak saboot hamaare chaaron taraf bikhare pade hon or vishwa swasthya sanghathan ne haal hi main hamen 'duniya main sabase zyada aatmahatya dar' ke sandigdh visheshan se nawaja ho
 Our culture of remaining silent about personal problems emerges even more badly when we are two to four of India's worst socio-economic people
 hamaare dimaagon main yah baat baithi hui he ki chaaron taraf itani bheeshan garibi se ghire hone par achche-bhale, khate-pite logon ko apni nijee samasyaon ke bare main jabaan khole bagaiyr shanti se rahanaa chahie
 Psychological problems and their expressions are not self-indulgence, but self-centeredness, which suits only the spoiled, the elites and the 'foreigners'
 lekin pichley paanch saal main manovishleshan or manochikitsa ke vikaas ke khilaaf khadey in sabhi rujhaanon main badlaav aayaa he
 The changing appearance of Indian families has increased personal needs and has become an important part of family life
 isi tarah auraton or samalangikon ke adhikaron or khuleam pyaar ke izhaar kii maang is baat kaa saboot he ki ab apane or apni abhivyakti ke liye vaidhata hasil karne kii zyada-se-zyada koshishen kii ja rahi hai
 But is it possible for India to dream of that kind of development in the field of psychoanalysis, as Argentina has realized? If this is the case, then psychoanalysis itself will have to make a slight change in the relationship that it has with patients in this country who are suffering from depression
 use is baat ko kubul karnaa hoga ki algaav, udaasi or akelaapan bhi inasaani anubhavon kaa hi behad khubasurat hissaa hai or ye bhi apane izhaar kii maang karte hai
 Even now, there is a big gap between those who care and those who need care
 avsaad koi aisi cheez nahin he, jise ilaaj se dho-ponchkar chutki bajaate saaf kiya ja sake
 It is a raw diamond, whose rough plank has not yet been carved
 yah jindagi kaa ek arthpurna mukaam he, jo maanviya anubhav main apni bhoomika adaa karata he
 Whether such ideas can come out of the grand rooms of the Fortis Hospital in a meaningful way or not among the common people, this will determine the important thing that India needs psychoanalysis and psychiatry and both those who provide the institutional help as much

 If our brothers are being attacked today and Pakistan has a hand in it, then we should not have any kind of relationship with them
 phir wo cricket ho chaahe vyapaar
 India is so powerful today that it can feed anyone, so much grain is produced in our country
 cricket or khel bahut choti cheez he, hamen javaanon ke pariwaron ke saath khadey hona chahie, unhone desh ke liye balidaan diya he or yah balidaan bekaar nahin janaa chahie
 Speaking about Pakistan Prime Minister and former cricketer Imran Khan, Harbhajan said that no official statement of Imran has come since the attack
 unhone kaha ki pehle mujhe lagata tha ki imran khan ke aane se donon mulkon ke rishte majboot honge, lekin agar aise hi hamale hote rahenge to bharat chup baithne vaala nahin, bharat ko har jagah jawaab dena aata he
 If india-pakistan clash in the final? When our sports editor Vikrant Gupta asked Harbhajan that even if he did not play against Pakistan, we also progressed in the initial round but what should be done in the final if the encounter is decided again
 iske jawaab main harbhajan ne kaha ki tab sthiti najuk ho jaaegi or sarkaar ko is bare main faisla lenaa hoga
 He hoped that big people are sitting in the government who will take a decision on this, because till then there is a lot of time
 harbhajan ne kaha ki is masale kaa hal nikalnaa chahie
 He said that whatever decision the country will take, we are fully with him

 The Congress wants the anti-bjp votes to be split in the assembly elections through a grand alliance
 saath hi, uski najar 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon par bhi he
 Though there is no official announcement yet, the state Congress leadership seems to be after initial discussions, giving 20-30 seats to its allies
 basapa ko 2013 main 6
 It got 42 percent votes and won four assembly seats
 isliye basapa kathith rup se kadaa mol-tol kar rahi he
 Apart from the existing four seats, the party also wants 12 seats where it stood second
 iske alaava vah 14 anya siton par bhi daawa kar rahi he jahaan is saal use acha pradarshan karne kii ummid he
 The Congress is relying on its state president Kamal Nath who has good relations with Mayawati
 party chaahati he ki mayawati ko 20 se kam siton ke liye raji kar liya jaae

 essi-asti kanoon main badlaav ke khilaaf virodh pradarshnon main agadi jati ke logon kii ore se kathith golibari main daliton kii maut se in ilaakon main daliton ke vot sangathit ho sakate hai
 Apart from this, there is also the GGP, a party of tribals, which may not have won a single seat in the 2013 elections, but it has 3
 6 pratishat vot mili the
 This party has considerable influence in Mahakaushal and Vindhya region
 vipaksh ke netaa ajay singh adivasee voton ke vibhaajan ko rokane ke liye jijipi ke saath congress ke gathbandhan ko lekar bahut icchhuk hai
 But will its constituents benefit from this possible alliance? The Congress's assessment is based on the assumption that SC and ST are its traditional vote banks and is expected to return to Congress again
 basapa or jijipi ke saath gathbandhan ke peeche congress kaa yahi maananaa he ki isse essi or asti ke vot bhaajapa se chhitak kar dur chale jaaenge
 However, over time, the BJP has carved a niche among the SC and ST castes
 essi kii 35 or asti kii 47 rigerv siton main se adhikansh uske kabje main hai
 To counter the Congress strategy, BJP has included Phool Singh Baraiya, a Dalit leader in the party
 baraiya basapa se alag hue ek sanghathan ke pramukh hai

 However, intranet was not provided in the House but Internet, through which the information obtained from the Library of Parliament and some other sources would be available to the mps through wi-fi on their mobile etc
 gauratlab he ki suraksha kaarnon kii vajah se sansad main aise jaimar lagaae gaye hai, jinaki vajah se donon sadanon ke bheetar mobile kaa signal nahin pakadta
 As of now, copies of every bill of Parliament, amendments, reports of the Standing Committee, etc

 charchaaon ke dauraan saansadon ko librari jaakar research material kaa print out nikalvaanaa padataa he or use lekar phir se sadan ke andar aate hai

 mps are often seen complaining that they did not get a copy of any bill or amendment

 So the intranet, rather than the Internet, has been arranged on the basis of wi-fi
 pehle hi din hi iskaa safal istemaal dekha gaya
 All the mps were getting information on the wi-fi intranet on their devices in the Library of Parliament, all government websites and reports of Parliament and Parliamentary institutions like CAG

 bijepi larguest party he magar bahumat nahin he
 The court wanted to know how the BJP has talked about proving majority
 isliye vah chitthee dekhnaa chaahati he
 Singhvi continues to cite the example of Goa, Manipur where the post-election coalition had a chance to form the government, not the single largest party
 singhvi chaahate the ki adaalat dakhal de or shapath grahan roak de
 But the counsel for the two BJP mlas said that the court cannot investigate which party the governor is satisfied with to form a permanent government
 mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki shapath le lene se aasmaan nahin tut padegaa
 The hearing on the petition is not good at night
 justise borde ne poocha ki kya mantrimandal se pehle vidhayakon ko shapath dilaai ja sakati he
 Then the Attorney General's reply was that there is no such tradition
 pehle mukhyamantri or mantrimandal shapath lete hai
 The judge asked that if a legislator changes party before the oath, then the defection law will be applied to him? The AG said that the anti-defection law will not apply if defection is done before the oath
 to shapath kii betaabi isliye thi ki shapath se pehle vidhayakon se paala badalawa liya jaae
 When the court asked that the congress-jds sent letters with 116 signatures, the AG clearly stated that many of the signatures were fake
 to court ne kaha ki rajyapal ko veriphai karnaa tha phir agi ne kaha ki sadan main pataa chal jayega
 Did the Governor investigate the fake signature and what was the answer to this question? shaayad nahin
 The government argued that the court cannot review the Governor's decisions
 jabaki tamaam adalati faislon main rajyapal se lekar rashtrapit ke faislon kaa adaalat ne samiksha kii he, palat bhi diya he or sahi bhi tehraaya he
 In the case of imposing President's rule in Uttarakhand, the Nainital High Court had said that the President is not the king
 20 april, 2016 ko chif justise ke em joseph or justise bi ke bisht ne sunwaayee ke dauraan tippanee kii thi ki 'log galat faisale le sakate hai chaahe wo raashtrapati hon yaa jaj
 
 
 This is not the decision of a king who cannot have a judicial review
 ' When the President is not the King, his decision cannot be judicially reviewed and the Supreme Court also upheld the verdict
 pranab mukherjee ke is faisle kii samiksha hui, rashtrati shashan hataa or harish ravat ne sadan ke patal par bahumat sabit kiya
 Whereas during this debate, Arun Jaitley wrote a blog about which every BJP leader used to defend the President's rule
 jetali ne likhaa tha ki 'raashtrapati shashan lagane kaa faisalaa raashtrapati ne apni raajnneetik samajhadaari or apane saare rakhe gaye dastavezon ke aadhaar par liya
 ' arunachal pradesh or uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan ke bachaav main bijepi ke tamaam kanoonvidon ne jitne bhi tark die the, supreme court main ek bhi nahin tike
 Nevertheless, Advocates kept defending afresh on behalf of two BJP mlas in the Supreme Court
 rohtagi bijepi ke teen vidhayakon kii taraf se bahes kar rahe the
 Rohatgi argued that the governor cannot be stopped from performing his constitutional obligation
 raashtrapati ko jajon kii niyukti ke warrant jari karne se nahin roka ja saktaa he
 The Governor's job is to administer oaths, right or wrong
 supreme court ne kaha ki ham shapath lene se nahin roak sakate hai lekin ye court ke faisle ke adheen hoga
 Now the hearing will be held at 10
30 am on Friday
 sari nazaren supreme court par hongi
 BS Yeddyurappa took the oath around 9 am
 jis jeet ko pradhanmantri or amit shah aitihaasik bataa rahe the wo is itihaas ke frem main nahin the
 Yeddyurappa was taking oath alone
 bijepi ke netaa josh se bhare hue zarur the magar wo baat nahin thi jab pehali baar karnataka main bijepi kii sarkaar bani thi tab party ke bade bade netaa sabhi dishaao se vahaan pahunche the
 BJP leader Sriramulu said prove the majority, talk to like-minded people and prove the magic number
 din bhar bijepi ke netaaon kii taraf se press conference hoti rahi
 The head of the Karnataka Intelligence Department has been replaced as soon as the government is formed
 chaar ipies kaa tabadalaa bhi kiya gaya he
 Yeddyurappa was taking oath in Karnataka, on the other hand, Congress and JDS leaders were preparing to sit on dharna in front of Gandhi's statue outside the assembly
 kya congress or jedies apane kheme ke 8 vidhayakon ko shapath se pehle bijepi kii taraf jane yaa bahumat pareekshan ke samay gaiyr haazir hone se roak paaenge, yah khel kaise khelaa jayega, bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mallikarjun Kharge, Siddaramaiah, Ji Parameswaran sat on the dharna
 baad main kumaraswami or ech di devegoda bhi dharne main shaamil ho gaye
 Their protests lasted for two hours and after that Congress mlas were taken to the resort and JDS mlas to the hotel
 ek nirdaleey vidhayak aar shankar congress kheme aa gaye jinke bare main bijepi ne daawa kiya tha ki shankar unke saath hai
 There are reports that two Congress mlas are missing
 media main inke bare main tarah tarah kii khabare hai
 On this day, remember all the governors of all the parties of the past who would not have disobeyed the Constitution, then no party can defend itself today
 isiilie buudhvaar raat jab ravishankar prasad press conference karne aae to sabase pehle unhone ateet ke rajyapalon ko yaad kiya
 Of course, they must have been during the Congress era, but the record has been similar for the governments of every party
 udhar is ghatana ne vipaksh ko bhi sakriy kar diya he
 Tejashwi Yadav is very active from Bihar
 tejasvi ne vipaksh ko ekajute hone kaa aahvaan kiya or kaha ki unki party bihar main shuukravaar ko ek din kaa dharna karegi or vipaksh ke saare netaa bangaloru pahunchen or vahaan sadak par utren
 Apart from this, Tejashwi Yadav is also raising the issue of Bihar that he had the most mlas and then why did not he get a chance and now he should also get a chance
 goa se bhi khabaren aa rahi hai ki kangrase sabase badi patch hone ke netaa rajyapal se milakar daawa karne ja rahi he
 If this argument is supreme that the largest party should get a chance first, then several months after the formation of the government there, the Congress is doing what the BJP is doing in Karnataka today
 is mudde par dilli ke vijay chowk par yashavanth sinha bhi dharne par baith gaye
 Yashwant Sinha had tweeted on May 16 that it seems good to see what has happened in Karnataka that he is no longer in the BJP
 yashamvat sinha ke saath rajd saansad manoj jha bhi hai
 Many people, including MLA from Timarpur, Delhi and founder of Swaraj Abhiyan, Pankaj Pushkar, sat on a dharna here
 tippaniyan The Congress was the largest party in Goa, but the government there was made up of the BJP
 vahaan bijepi ke mukhyamantri do-do chunaav kshetra se haar gaye
 Six ministers were defeated
 is hisaab se janadesh bijepi ke khilaaf hua
 Then the BJP merged Vijay Sardesai of the Goa Forward Party who was contesting the election with the slogan of bjp-free Goa
 nateeja aate hi ve bijepi se mil gaye or unke teenon vidhayak mantri ban gaye
 100% defections, 100% cabinet
 raajnneeti main apana nahin duusare kaa kaha jaataa he isliye karnataka main bijepi kah rahi he ki congress ne jedies ke khilaaf chunaav ladaa to uskaa gathbandhan aniatik he
 Arun Jaitley's tweet and blog are very much discussed during this on Goa
 tab jetali ne likhaa tha ki congress ne bijepi par goa ke janadesh ko chori karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 His petition in the Supreme Court was unsuccessful
 
 
 congress ne loksabhaa main bhi mudde uthaane kii koshish kii
 But what do the facts say? The mandate in the Goa assembly elections came
 ek trishanku vidhansabha bani
 In such a situation there will be post poll alliance
 bijepi ek gathbandhan banane main kaamyaab rahi or rajyapal ke saamne 40 main se 21 vidhayakon kaa samarthan pesh kiya
 Tejashwi Yadav is also adamant that if the single largest thing is right, then the Governor should give him a chance to form the government
 rajd ne bihar ke rajyapal or goa main congress ne rajyapal se milane kaa samay maanga he
 It is a great thing that our courts stay up all night
 raat ek baje teen jajon kii bench banati he or 2 baj kar 10 minute par sunwaayee shuru hoti he, saadhe paanch baje tak chalati rahi
 Our colleague Ashish Bhargava and Manoranjan Bharti, Umashankar Singh continued to cover overnight
 congress or jedies kii taraf se abhishek manu singhvi bahes kar rahe the, sarkaar kii taraf se adishnal solisitor general tushaar mehta or purv atorni general mukul rohtagi ne bahes kii
 The Congress argues that there is a direct rule that the person with a majority should be called
 iske baad pre pole gathbandhan ko or wo bahumat sabit na kar paae to chunaav baad gathbandhan ko
 Then after the election if there is no majority, then the largest party or group should be called and not the single largest party
 rameshwar prasad jajment or sarkaria kamishan ne yahi vyavastha di gai he
 The Supreme Court has also upheld it in the 2017 judgment
 court ne kaha he ki sarkaria report main bhi bahumat vaali ekal party ko bulaane kii baat kahi gai he jiske paas sarkaar banane ke liye bahumat ho
 BJP is the largest party but not a majority
 adaalat yah jaananaa chaahati thi ki bijepi ne kis tareeke se bahumat sabit karne kii baat kii he
 So she wants to see the letter
 singhvi goa, manipur kaa udhaaharan dete rahe jahaan chunaav baad ke gathbandhan ko sarkaar banane kaa mauka mila tha, single larguest party ko nahin
 Singhvi wanted the court to intervene and stop swearing
 lekin bijepi ke do vidhayakon ke vakil ne kaha ki adaalat jaanch nahin kar sakati ki sthaayee sarkaar banane ko lekar rajyapal kis party ko lekar santusht hai
 Mukul Rohatgi said that taking oath will not break the sky
 raat ke vakt yachika par sunwaayee thik nahin he
 Justice Borde asked if the legislators could be administered oath before the cabinet
 tab atorni general kaa jawaab tha ki aisi koi parampara nahin he
 First the Chief Minister and the Cabinet take oath
 jaj ne poocha ki agar koi vidhayak shapath ke pehle dal badal le to us par dalbadal kanoon lagu hoga? agi ne kaha ki shapath se pehle dalbadal karne par dalbadal virdohi kanoon lagu nahin hoga
 So the oath was so that the mlas should be brought up before the oath
 court ne poocha ki congress-jedies ne 116 dastakhat ke saath patr bheje hai to agi ne saaf kah diya ki kai sin farji hai
 So the court said that the governor had to verify, then the AG said that it will be known in the house
 kya rajyapal ne farji dastakhat kii jaanch kii is sawaal kaa kya jawaab diya gaya
 Probably not
 sarkaar kii daleel thi ki rajyapal ke faislon ko court rivyuu nahin kar saktaa he
 Whereas in all court rulings, the decisions of the Governor to the President have been reviewed by the court, overturned and justified
 uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke maamle main nainital hoicourt ne kaha tha raashtrapati raja nahin hota he
 On April 20, 2016, Chief Justice KM Joseph and Justice BK Bisht remarked during the hearing that 'people can take wrong decisions whether they are the President or the Judge
 
 
 ye koi raja kaa faisalaa nahin he jisaki nyaayik samiksha naa ho sakati ho
 ' jab raashtrapati raja nahin hai, unke faisle kii nyaayik samiksha nahin ho sakati he or is faisle ko supreme court ne bhi sahi mana
 This decision of Pranab Mukherjee was reviewed, removed national rule and Harish Rawat proved majority on the floor of the House
 jabaki is bahes ke dauraan arun jetali ne ek blog likhaa tha jise lekar bijepi kaa har netaa raashtrapati shashan kaa bachaav karata tha
 Jaitley wrote that 'president's decision to impose President's rule was taken on the basis of his political prudence and all his documents kept
 ' In Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, all the arguments made by all the BJP legalists in defending the President's rule did not stand in the Supreme Court
 phir bhi supreme court me bijepi ke do vidhayakon kii taraf se vakil nae sire se bachaav karte rahe
 Rohatgi was arguing on behalf of three BJP mlas
 rohtagi ne daleel di ki rajyapal ko unke sanvaidhanik daayitv kaa paalan karne se nahin roka ja saktaa he
 The President cannot be prevented from issuing warrants for the appointment of judges
 rajyapal kaa kaam he shapath dilaanaa, sahi yaa galat
 The Supreme Court said that we cannot stop the oath taking but it will be subject to the decision of the court
 ab sunwaayee shuukravaar ko subah saadhe das baje hogi
 All eyes will be on the Supreme Court
 bi es yediurppa ne subah nau baje ke kareeb shapath le lee
 The victory that the Prime Minister and Amit Shah were referring to as historical was not in the frame of this history
 yediurppa akele shapath le rahe the
 The BJP leaders were sure to be full of enthusiasm, but that was not the case when the BJP government was formed in Karnataka for the first time, then big leaders of the party reached there from all directions
 bijepi ke netaa shriramulu ne kaha ki bahumat sabit kar den, samaan vichaardhaara waalon se baat karenge or magic number sabit kar den
 There was a press conference on behalf of BJP leaders throughout the day
 sarkaar banate hi karnataka khufia vibhaag ke mukhiya ko badal diya gaya he
 Four IPS have also been transferred
 karnataka main yediurppa shapath le rahe the duusari taraf congress or jedies ke netaa vidhansabha ke baahar gandhi kii pratimaa ke saamne dharne par baithne kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 Whether Congress and JDS will prevent 8 mlas of their camp from going to BJP before the oath or non-attendance at the time of majority test, there is no need to tell how this game will be played
 gulam nabi azaad, mallikarjun khadge, siddharmaiya, ji parameshwaran dharne par baith gaye
 Later Kumaraswamy and HD Deve Gowda also joined the dharna
 do ghante tak inkaa pradarshan chalaa or uske baad congress vidhayakon ko resort main or jedies vidhayakon ko hotel main le jaaya gaya
 An independent MLA, r Shankar, came to the Congress camp, which was claimed by the BJP to be with him
 khabar he ki congress do vidhayak laapata hai
 There are various types of news about them in the media
 aaj ke din ateet ke sabhi dalon ke hue un sabhi rajyapalon ko yaad kiijie jinhone samvidhan kii dhajjiyaan na udaayi hoti to aaj koi bhi paksh khud kaa bachaav nahin kar saktaa
 That is why when Ravi Shankar Prasad came to press conference on Wednesday night, he first remembered the governors of the past
 beshak ve congress ke daur ke rahe honge magar record har dal kii sarkaron kaa aisa hi rahaa he
 On the other hand, this incident has also activated the opposition
 bihar se tejasvi yadav kaaphi sakriy hai
 Tejashwi called upon the opposition to unite and said that his party would hold a day-long dharna in Bihar on Friday and that all the opposition leaders reach Bangalore and hit the road there
 tejasvi yadav iske alaava bihar kaa bhi masalaa uthaa rahe hai ki unke paas sabase adhik vidhayak the or hai tab kyon nahin mauka mila or ab unhen bhi mauka milanaa chahie
 There are also reports from Goa that the Congress leader is going to meet the Governor to claim the biggest party
 agar yahi tark supreme he ki sabase badi party ko pehle mauka milanaa chahie to vahaan sarkaar ban jane ke kai maheene baad congress vahi kar rahi he jo aaj karnataka main bijepi kar rahi he
 Yashwant Sinha also sat on a dharna at Vijay Chowk in Delhi on this issue
 yashwant sinha ne 16 may ko twit kar diya tha ki karnataka main jo hua he usase dekhakar yahi lagata he ki acha hua ve ab bijepi main nahin hai
 Yashwant Sinha is also accompanied by RJD MP Manoj Jha
 dilli ke timarpur se vidhayak or swaraj abhiyaan ke sansthaapak sadsy pankaj pushkar sahit kai log yahaan dharne par baithe
 The comments goa main congress sabase badi party thi magar vahaan sarkaar bijepi kii bani
 The BJP chief minister lost two to two constituencies there
 chah mantri haar gaye the
 Accordingly, the mandate was against the BJP
 tab bijepi ne us goa farverd party ke vijay saradesai ko mila liya jo bijepi mukt goa kaa naaraa dekar chunaav lard rahe the
 As a result, he joined the BJP and all three of his mlas became ministers
 sau fisadi dalbadal, sau fisadi mantrilamandal
 In politics, it is said to be other than its own, so BJP in Karnataka is saying that if Congress contested against JDS, its alliance is immoral
 is par goa ke dauraan arun jetali kaa twit or blog kaaphi charchaa main he
 Then Jaitley wrote that the Congress accused the BJP of stealing Goa's mandate
 supreme court main uski yachika naakaam rahi
 
 
 The Congress also tried to raise issues in the Lok Sabha
 lekin tathy kya kehete hai? goa vidhansabha chunaavon main benatija janadesh aayaa
 a hung assembly was formed
 aisi sthiti main post pole elliance honge hi
 The BJP managed to form a coalition and presented the support of 21 of the 40 mlas to the Governor
 tejasvi yadav bhi ad gaye hai ki agar single larguest vaali baat sahi he to unhen rajyapal sarkaar banane kaa mauka den
 The RJD has sought the Governor of Bihar and the Congress in Goa to meet the Governor
 congress kaa tark he ki sidhaa niyam he ki jiskaa bahumat ho use bulaayaa jaae
 After this, if they could not prove the pre-poll alliance and the majority, then the post-election alliance
 phir chunaav baad ke paas bahumat na ho tab jaakar sabase badi party yaa samooh ko bulaayaa jaae na ki akeli sabase badi party ko
 The same arrangement has been given by Rameshwar Prasad Judgment and Sarkaria Commission
 supreme court ne bhi ise 2017 ke faisle main sahi tehraaya he
 The court has said that the Sarkaria report also talks of calling a single party with majority to form a government
 bijepi larguest party he magar bahumat nahin he
 The court wanted to know how the BJP has talked about proving majority
 isliye vah chitthee dekhnaa chaahati he

 BS Yeddyurappa took the oath around 9 am
 jis jeet ko pradhanmantri or amit shah aitihaasik bataa rahe the wo is itihaas ke frem main nahin the
 Yeddyurappa was taking oath alone
 bijepi ke netaa josh se bhare hue zarur the magar wo baat nahin thi jab pehali baar karnataka main bijepi kii sarkaar bani thi tab party ke bade bade netaa sabhi dishaao se vahaan pahunche the
 BJP leader Sriramulu said prove the majority, talk to like-minded people and prove the magic number
 din bhar bijepi ke netaaon kii taraf se press conference hoti rahi
 The head of the Karnataka Intelligence Department has been replaced as soon as the government is formed
 chaar ipies kaa tabadalaa bhi kiya gaya he
 Yeddyurappa was taking oath in Karnataka, on the other hand, Congress and JDS leaders were preparing to sit on dharna in front of Gandhi's statue outside the assembly
 kya congress or jedies apane kheme ke 8 vidhayakon ko shapath se pehle bijepi kii taraf jane yaa bahumat pareekshan ke samay gaiyr haazir hone se roak paaenge, yah khel kaise khelaa jayega, bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mallikarjun Kharge, Siddaramaiah, Ji Parameswaran sat on the dharna
 baad main kumaraswami or ech di devegoda bhi dharne main shaamil ho gaye
 Their protests lasted for two hours and after that Congress mlas were taken to the resort and JDS mlas to the hotel
 ek nirdaleey vidhayak aar shankar congress kheme aa gaye jinke bare main bijepi ne daawa kiya tha ki shankar unke saath hai
 There are reports that two Congress mlas are missing
 media main inke bare main tarah tarah kii khabare hai
 On this day, remember all the governors of all the parties of the past who had not blown the Constitution, then today no party can defend itself
 isiilie buudhvaar raat jab ravishankar prasad press conference karne aae to sabase pehle unhone ateet ke rajyapalon ko yaad kiya
 Of course, they must have been during the Congress era, but the record has been similar for the governments of every party
 udhar is ghatana ne vipaksh ko bhi sakriy kar diya he
 Tejashwi Yadav is very active from Bihar
 tejasvi ne vipaksh ko ekajute hone kaa aahvaan kiya or kaha ki unki party bihar main shuukravaar ko ek din kaa dharna karegi or vipaksh ke saare netaa bangaloru pahunchen or vahaan sadak par utren
 Apart from this, Tejashwi Yadav is also raising the issue of Bihar that he had the most mlas and then why did not he get a chance and now he should also get a chance
 goa se bhi khabaren aa rahi hai ki kangrase sabase badi patch hone ke netaa rajyapal se milakar daawa karne ja rahi he
 If this argument is supreme that the largest party should get a chance first, then several months after the formation of the government there, the Congress is doing what the BJP is doing in Karnataka today
 is mudde par dilli ke vijay chowk par yashavanth sinha bhi dharne par baith gaye
 Yashwant Sinha had tweeted on May 16 that it seems good to see what has happened in Karnataka that he is no longer in the BJP
 yashamvat sinha ke saath rajd saansad manoj jha bhi hai
 Many people, including MLA from Timarpur, Delhi and founder of Swaraj Abhiyan, Pankaj Pushkar, sat on a dharna here
 tippaniyan The Congress was the largest party in Goa, but the government there was made up of the BJP
 vahaan bijepi ke mukhyamantri do-do chunaav kshetra se haar gaye
 Six ministers were defeated
 is hisaab se janadesh bijepi ke khilaaf hua
 Then the BJP merged Vijay Sardesai of the Goa Forward Party who was contesting the election with the slogan of bjp-free Goa
 nateeja aate hi ve bijepi se mil gaye or unke teenon vidhayak mantri ban gaye
 100% defections, 100% cabinet
 raajnneeti main apana nahin duusare kaa kaha jaataa he isliye karnataka main bijepi kah rahi he ki congress ne jedies ke khilaaf chunaav ladaa to uskaa gathbandhan aniatik he
 Arun Jaitley's tweet and blog are very much discussed during this on Goa
 tab jetali ne likhaa tha ki congress ne bijepi par goa ke janadesh ko chori karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 His petition in the Supreme Court was unsuccessful
 
 
 congress ne loksabhaa main bhi mudde uthaane kii koshish kii
 But what do the facts say? The mandate in the Goa assembly elections came
 ek trishanku vidhansabha bani
 In such a situation there will be post poll alliance
 bijepi ek gathbandhan banane main kaamyaab rahi or rajyapal ke saamne 40 main se 21 vidhayakon kaa samarthan pesh kiya
 Tejashwi Yadav is also adamant that if the single largest thing is right, then the Governor should give him a chance to form the government
 rajd ne bihar ke rajyapal or goa main congress ne rajyapal se milane kaa samay maanga he
 So the oath was so that the mlas should be brought up before the oath
 court ne poocha ki congress-jedies ne 116 dastakhat ke saath patr bheje hai to agi ne saaf kah diya ki kai sin farji hai
 So the court said that the governor had to verify, then the AG said that it will be known in the house
 kya rajyapal ne farji dastakhat kii jaanch kii is sawaal kaa kya jawaab diya gaya
 Probably not
 sarkaar kii daleel thi ki rajyapal ke faislon ko court rivyuu nahin kar saktaa he
 Whereas in all court rulings, the decisions of the Governor to the President have been reviewed by the court, overturned and justified
 uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke maamle main nainital hoicourt ne kaha tha raashtrapati raja nahin hota he
 On April 20, 2016, Chief Justice KM Joseph and Justice BK Bisht remarked during the hearing that 'people can take wrong decisions whether they are the President or the Judge
 
 
 ye koi raja kaa faisalaa nahin he jisaki nyaayik samiksha naa ho sakati ho
 ' jab raashtrapati raja nahin hai, unke faisle kii nyaayik samiksha nahin ho sakati he or is faisle ko supreme court ne bhi sahi mana
 This decision of Pranab Mukherjee was reviewed, removed national rule and Harish Rawat proved majority on the floor of the House
 jabaki is bahes ke dauraan arun jetali ne ek blog likhaa tha jise lekar bijepi kaa har netaa raashtrapati shashan kaa bachaav karata tha
 Jaitley wrote that 'president's decision to impose President's rule was taken on the basis of his political prudence and all his documents kept
 ' In Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, all the arguments made by all the BJP legalists in defending the President's rule did not stand in the Supreme Court
 phir bhi supreme court me bijepi ke do vidhayakon kii taraf se vakil nae sire se bachaav karte rahe
 Rohatgi was arguing on behalf of three BJP mlas
 rohtagi ne daleel di ki rajyapal ko unke sanvaidhanik daayitv kaa paalan karne se nahin roka ja saktaa he
 The President cannot be prevented from issuing warrants for the appointment of judges
 rajyapal kaa kaam he shapath dilaanaa, sahi yaa galat
 The Supreme Court said that we cannot stop the oath taking but it will be subject to the decision of the court
 ab sunwaayee shuukravaar ko subah saadhe das baje hogi
 All eyes will be on the Supreme Court
 bi es yediurppa ne subah nau baje ke kareeb shapath le lee
 The victory that the Prime Minister and Amit Shah were referring to as historical was not in the frame of this history
 yediurppa akele shapath le rahe the
 The BJP leaders were sure to be full of enthusiasm, but that was not the case when the BJP government was formed in Karnataka for the first time, then big leaders of the party reached there from all directions
 bijepi ke netaa shriramulu ne kaha ki bahumat sabit kar den, samaan vichaardhaara waalon se baat karenge or magic number sabit kar den
 There was a press conference on behalf of BJP leaders throughout the day
 sarkaar banate hi karnataka khufia vibhaag ke mukhiya ko badal diya gaya he
 Four IPS have also been transferred
 karnataka main yediurppa shapath le rahe the duusari taraf congress or jedies ke netaa vidhansabha ke baahar gandhi kii pratimaa ke saamne dharne par baithne kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 Whether Congress and JDS will prevent 8 mlas of their camp from going to BJP before the oath or non-attendance at the time of majority test, there is no need to tell how this game will be played
 gulam nabi azaad, mallikarjun khadge, siddharmaiya, ji parameshwaran dharne par baith gaye
 Later Kumaraswamy and HD Deve Gowda also joined the dharna
 do ghante tak inkaa pradarshan chalaa or uske baad congress vidhayakon ko resort main or jedies vidhayakon ko hotel main le jaaya gaya
 An independent MLA, r Shankar, came to the Congress camp, which was claimed by the BJP to be with him
 khabar he ki congress do vidhayak laapata hai
 There are various types of news about them in the media
 aaj ke din ateet ke sabhi dalon ke hue un sabhi rajyapalon ko yaad kiijie jinhone samvidhan kii dhajjiyaan na udaayi hoti to aaj koi bhi paksh khud kaa bachaav nahin kar saktaa
 That is why when Ravi Shankar Prasad came to press conference on Wednesday night, he first remembered the governors of the past
 beshak ve congress ke daur ke rahe honge magar record har dal kii sarkaron kaa aisa hi rahaa he
 On the other hand, this incident has also activated the opposition
 bihar se tejasvi yadav kaaphi sakriy hai
 Tejashwi called upon the opposition to unite and said that his party would hold a day-long dharna in Bihar on Friday and that all the opposition leaders reach Bangalore and hit the road there
 tejasvi yadav iske alaava bihar kaa bhi masalaa uthaa rahe hai ki unke paas sabase adhik vidhayak the or hai tab kyon nahin mauka mila or ab unhen bhi mauka milanaa chahie
 There are also reports from Goa that the Congress leader is going to meet the Governor to claim the biggest party
 agar yahi tark supreme he ki sabase badi party ko pehle mauka milanaa chahie to vahaan sarkaar ban jane ke kai maheene baad congress vahi kar rahi he jo aaj karnataka main bijepi kar rahi he
 Yashwant Sinha also sat on a dharna at Vijay Chowk in Delhi on this issue
 yashwant sinha ne 16 may ko twit kar diya tha ki karnataka main jo hua he usase dekhakar yahi lagata he ki acha hua ve ab bijepi main nahin hai
 Yashwant Sinha is also accompanied by RJD MP Manoj Jha

 As a result, he joined the BJP and all three of his mlas became ministers

 In politics, it is said to be other than its own, so BJP in Karnataka is saying that if Congress contested against JDS, its alliance is immoral

 Then Jaitley wrote that the Congress accused the BJP of stealing Goa's mandate

 He takes great care of his fitness and is very active
 iske alaava soshal media par bhi ve kaaphi sakriy hai
 Sometime back, he had praised Narendra Modi's interview taken on Twitter by Akshay Kumar
 pashchim bengal ke shanti niketan main vishwa bharti vishvavidhyalay ke 49wein kanvocation main pradhanmantri narendra modi or bangladesh kii pradhanmantri shaikh hasina shuukravaar ko shaamil hue
 Where PM Modi and Sheikh Hasina also visited Ravindra Bhavan
 kanvocation ke dauraan modi ne chaatro ko shiksha se sambandhit kai baaten kahi
 Together he told what Vishw Bharati University founder Rabindranath Tagore expected from the students
 aapako bataa den, pradhanmantri banane ke baad se yah modi kaa kisi vishvavidhyalay kaa pehla daura he
 The last time any chancellor of the institute was present at the convocation was in 2008
 PM modi bole- chancelar ke naate vishwabharati main asuvidha kii jimmedaariie jaanate hai modi ne chaatro se kya kaha:-- modi ne kaha main yahaan atithi ke taur par nahin acharya ke taur par aayaa hum
 - Modi reminded Rabindranath Tagore about the students and said that Gurudev believed that every person is born to achieve some goal
 prayek balak apni lakshya-prapti kii disha main bad sake, iske liye use yogya bananaa shiksha kaa mahatvapurn kaary he
 - He further said - He used to say that education is not only what is imparted in school
 - modi ne kaha gurudev chaahate the ki bhartiya chaatr bahari duniya main bhi jo kuch ho rahaa he, usase parichit rahen
 He always insisted on knowing about how people of other countries live, what their social, cultural values are
 lekin isi ke saath wo ye bhi kehete the ki bhartiyata nahin bhulani chahie
 PM Modi said - Responsibility of inconvenience in Vishwabharati as Chancellor- Modi said that in order to improve the education system, in the early age, we have selected 2400 schools across the country to prepare a mind set of innovation (innovation)
 in skulon main 'atal Tinkering Labs' ke madhyam se 6thi se 12veen kaksha ke chaatro par focus kiya ja rahaa he
 In these labs, children are being introduced to modern technology
 - unhone ne kaha shaikshik sansthaaon ko paryaapt suvidhaayen mili, iske liye 1000 karod rupye ke nivesh ke saath 'higher Education Financing Agency' shuru kii gai he
 This has helped in investment for high quality infrastructure in major educational institutions
 ajukeshan system main sudhaaraj ke daur main bigadataa ajukeshan system sabase badi chintaa kaa vishay he
 Because the lack of better education is messing with the future of the students
 piem modi kaa kahana he ki desh ke yuvaaon ko agar behatar shiksha or suvidha milegi, tabhi desh pragati kii ore aage bad sakegaa
 At the same time, Moedi told the students that in the next four years, 1 lakh crore rupees will be spent to improve the education system of the country so that every student in India can get a better and quality education
 vishwa bharti vishvavidhyalay ke 49wein kanvocation main shaamil hue modi ne chaatro se kaha aap yuva peedi desh kaa bhavishya hai
 Even if no one is ready to walk with you, still keep walking towards your goal alone
 lekin aap akel nahin he sarkaar aapke saath chalegi
 Modi said, i want to tell the students that if you walk one step, the government will run four steps
 janabhagidaari ke saath badhate hue ye kadam hi hamaare desh ko us mukaam tak lekar jaaenge, jiskaa sapana gurudev ne bhi dekha tha
 He said that along with Vishwa Bharati University New India, keep showing the world new avenues, i conclude with this wish
 jaane kab hui vishwa bharti vishvavidhyalay kii sthapanavishwa bharti vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana 23 disbanr 1921 main hui
 The founder of this university was done by Rabindranath Tagore

 ashes siries ke pehle test ke chauthe din ek world record banate banate rah gaya
 In the 10th over of Australia's second innings, Stuart Broad sent Australian opener Chris Rodgers to the pavilion and could not make a big world record
 broad ne todaa world record kaa sapana
 
 
 Rodgers has previously had Pachasa roots in seven consecutive Test innings, and if he had taken one more Pachasa root, his name would have been written with golden letters in Testcricket history

 However he was confident that he was not out and stood on the ground for some time
 tivi ampire ne riple main dekha, riple se saaf tha ki iyaan bel ne safai se kaich lapka he
 Broad's beautiful ball did not allow the world record to be made, and Rodgers had to return to the pavilion
 match kaa doosraa din rogers ke naam rahaa tha
 Rodgers, however, was a bit unlucky and missed by just five runs as he hit the century

 Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas surrendered in the court of Sultanpur on Saturday
 court main kareeb 3 ghante tak bahes chali or puri bahes ke dauraan kumaar vishwaas katghare main khadey rahe, jiske baad unhen jamaanat de di gai

 Nirav Modi, the prime accused in the PNB bank scam, is looking to consolidate his business before reaching investigative agencies Hong Kong
 india today ko modi se jude kuch aise dastavej mili hai jo is baat kii tasdik karte hai ki vah vahaan se bhaagane kii yojana main jute gaya he
 Nirav Modiki Firestar International Pvt Ltd, a non-hong Kong company, has informed Hong Kong administration on behalf of Suresh Kumar Bhutani, secretary of this company, that his company is consolidating its business in Hong Kong
 india today ko 'da notice of siseshan of place of bijness' naam kaa jo dastavej hasil hua he, use pichley saal 12 disambar ko prashasan ko bheja gaya tha, lekin hong cong companyj registry ne is saal 19 janvari ko notiphoi kiya
 Modi's Firestar International Private Limited has consolidated its business in Hong Kong
 neerav modi se sambandhit yahi ekmaatr company he jisane haal ke dinon main is tarah kaa notice file kiya he
 While in Hong Kong, other companies Nirav Modi Limited, Nirav Modi HK Limited, Firestar Diamond Limited and Firestar Holding Limited, associated with Nirav Modi, do not hold any directorship or any personal control
 neerav modipane khilaaf bhartiya jaanch agenciyon kii tej hoti jaanch or sampati ko bachaane kii koshish main hong cong se apana bijness samet kar kahin or shift karne kii koshish main lage hue hai
 All these companies have the same common address in Hong Kong 21-23, 2 / f New Henry House, 10 Ice House Street, Central Hong Kong
 jabaki hong cong kii company registry ke adhikariyon ne is vishay par kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 When the tension increases between all these obstacles, count the countdown, take a long breath and just remember that you have the courage and ability to face all the problems
 centre kii modi sarkaar dwaara obisi ayog ko sanvaidhanik darja dene vaala 123waan samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak loksabhaa se paarit ho gaya he
 The Modi government may not face any difficulty in getting it passed in the Lok Sabha, but the government may face difficulty in the Rajya Sabha
 haalanki, yadi bijedy or samaajawaadee party rajyasabha main samarthan karte hai to yah bill rajyasabha main bhi paas ho jayega
 Actually, this bill has been introduced for the second time by the Central Government
 isse pehle pichley varsh rajyasabha main sarkaar kii kirakiri tab hui thi jab vipaksh ke sanshodhan paas ho gaye the
 Hence, there was a need to bring this bill again with amendments
 mishan 2019 he lakshya !gauratlab he ki 2019 se pehle bhartiya janata party pichhadon or daliton kii himachati kii chhavi bananaa chaahati he
 As part of this strategy, the Modi government at the Center wants to pass constitutional status to the OBC commission and pass the SC / ST Atrocities Prevention Act (SC / ST Act) amendment bill from both the houses at any cost in this session
 taaki pradhanmantri narendra modi netritv main bijepi aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon main pichhadon or daliton ko lubhaane ke liye ek badi uplabdhi ke taur par pesh kar sake
 What is the arithmetic of dalit-backward? To defeat the Modi government at the center, the joint opposition is creating a cycle of grand alliance
 vahiin vipaksh ke is vyuh rachana ko todane ke liye modi sarkaar kii yojana bahusankhyak pichhadon or daliton ko saadhane kii he
 Since politics is a game of numbers
 vahiin sarkari aankadon ke anusaar dalit-pichhadaa samaaj kii jansankhya desh kii kul aabaadi kaa 70 fisadi he
 This is the reason why no regional and national party can afford to ignore this class
 sarkari agency eneseso ke mutabik desh main anya pichhadaa varg (obisi) kii aabaadi kul aabaadi kaa 44 fisadi he
 At the same time, there is no Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha where there is no 40-45 percent backward vote
 isi tarah se 2011 kii janaganana ke anusaar desh main 16
 63 per cent Scheduled Castes and 8
 6 fisadi anusuchit janajati ke log hai
 Which has a decisive role in 150 Lok Sabha seats
 kya jatiyon main banta pichhadaa varg kabhi ek hoga ?desh kii aabaadi main bhale hi obisi sabase zyada hon lekin chunaavon main yah puraa samaaj kabhi ek saath ek votbank kii tarah ubhar kar nahin aayaa
 Except for the Mandal movement, it is difficult to say that the obcs, like the Dalits and Muslims, vote in unison as a vote bank
 iskaa kaaran he vibhinn jatiyon or saamaajik str par banta obisi samaaj
 For example, Yadav and Patel were never united in UP, similarly Yadav, Kushwaha and Kurmi were not united in Bihar
 thik vaise hi rajasthan main gurjar or meena ek nahin hue
 Please tell that all these communities are socially and economically strong and they also have commitment in some political party
 jise tod paanaa mushkil he
 Will the backward classes be made up of all categories? To attract the backward classes, the Modi government at the center is working on two types of strategies
 pehla rashtriya pichhadaa varg ayog ko sanvaidhanik darja dilaanaa
 Secondly to constitute a commission for the sub-classification of obcs
 is ayog kaa gathan 2 oktober 2017 ko kiya gaya tha
 This commission will decide on what proportionate basis can be given to the castes included in the OBC
 kya isamen shaamil jatiyon ko aarakshan kaa uchit laabh mil paaya he yaa ek hi birdari sari malai kaat rahi he
 This exercise of Modi government can be seen as an attempt to gather economically strong Yadavs of UP, Bihar and other backward castes against Kurmis
 gauratlab he ki is tarah kaa prayog bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kar chuke he
 Nitish left the Shigufa of the Maha Dalit class to make a dent in the Dalit vote bank of RJD chief Lalu Yadav
 jithan ram maanjhi kaa raajnneetik utthan or mukhyamantri bananaa isi kii baangi thi
 But this experiment of Nitish has lost political ambition and Jitan Ram Manjhi is once again standing with the Lalu camp
 isi tarah yogi sarkaar ke mantri anil rajbhar, rajbharon ko ati pichhadaa varg yani ibisi category main shaamil karana chaahate hai
 Because the faith of the Rajbhars is more than Anil, with Suhail Dev Bhartiya Samaj Party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar
 baharhaal yah kahana jaldbaaji hoga ki centre kii modi sarkaar dalit-pichhadon ko apane saath laa paane main kaamyaab ho paaegi yaa nahin
 But it is certain that the government does not want to leave any stone unturned to help the Dalits and the backward
 aisa karne ke liye modi sarkaar ke paas paryaapt bahumat bhi he or sarkari tantra bhi he
 Rushabh Pantko may also find a place in the squad for the current ODI against the West Indies due to Mahendra Singh Dhoni's poor batting form
 guuruuvaar ko hyderabad main chayan samiti kii baithak main yah nirnay liya ja saktaa he
 It is not yet decided whether the team will be selected for the first three matches or for the entire series
 vanade siries kii shuruyaat 21 oktober se hogi, jisamen paanch ekadivasiy or teen tii-20 antarrashtriya match khele jaaenge
 Skipper Virat Kohli's workload is also an important issue, but it is unlikely that he would like to take rest from the entire series
 iske alaava dhoni ke cover ko lekar chayankartaaon or team prabandhan ke bich charchaa ho sakati he
 Dhoni's wicketkeeping is sharp, but his batting form has declined
 chayan maamalon kii jaankaree rakhane vaale bisisiai ke ek varisht adhikari ne buudhvaar ko pitiai se kaha, ‚Äòham sabhi ko pataa he ki dhoni vishwa cap tak khelenge
 But there is no harm in improving Pant, who can be a great batsman at number six or seven, who has the ability to finish the match
 ‚Äôda ovel main pehla test shatak jadne ke baad rajkot main bhi pant ne 92 ranon kii pari kheli, jiske baad 20 saal ke is wicketiper ballebaaj ko team main shaamil karne kii maang tej ho rahi he
 Dinesh Karthik has been a part of the team, but his performance lacks consistency and he has failed to finish the match on important occasions, which is a concern of the team management
 chayankarta iske alaava kuch or vikalpon par bhi vichaar kar sakate hai
 Kedar Jadhav is nervous about his leg muscles and has been ruled out of the limited overs phase, making it a place in the middle order
 asia cap main achche pradarshan ke baad ambati raidu kaa chunaa janaa lagbhag tay he, phir bhale hi kohli khilne kaa faisla karen yaa nahin
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah's return after the break from the current Test series is almost certain

 However, Manish Pandey can be dropped from the team, who has failed to perform well for some time

 The first match of the two-test series between India and Bangladesh is to be played from November 14 to 18
 11 saal se apni veeraanagi par ro rahaa he el 18 flatspados main rah rahe log aaj bhi nahin bhuule goliyon kii barsatbotla encounter se thik pehle hue the serial blastdilli ke jamiya nagar ke bottla house ilaake kii building el-18 kii chauthi manzil kaa flats number 108 aaj bhi viraan he
 11 years ago today, on 19 September 2008, in this flat, Delhi Police encounter some people
 muthbhed main do log maare jate hai, jinke bare main dilli police bataati he ki ve aatankwaadi the or dilli blast ke mukhya sajeeshkarta the
 In this encounter, a policeman is also martyred by firing bullets
 bottla house encounter ke baad se el-18 imaarat ke flats number 108 ajtak apni veeraanagi par ro rahaa he
 Neither the lock of this flat has been opened, neither has anyone come here to live on rent nor has anyone come to buy it
 is flats kaa maalik bhi ab to dilli ke jamiya nagar se dur gajiabad main jaakar bas gaya he
 On 19 September 2008, Suhail Anwar, living in the flat in front of the flat on which the Batla House was firing, aajtak
 in se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki 11 saal pehle yah flats jis prakaar se band kiya gaya he, vaise hi aaj bhi band he
 No one has come to live in this flat, nor has anyone come to see it
 is flats main laga windo asi aaj bhi vaise hi laga hua he
 Although this flat was sealed, it has been removed a year ago on court orders
 iske baavjood yahaan par koi rahane ke liye nahin aayaa he
 Suhail Anwar recalls the events of September 19, 2008, saying that what had happened that day, everything had happened in front of our eyes
 use yaad kar aaj bhi ruh kaanp jaati he, lekin ab ghatana ko kaaphi din guzar gaye hai
 That is why with time we do not even want to remember it, but if the flat is in front, then it is remembered
 vah kehete hai ki saamne vaale flats main kaaphi ladke rahaa karte the or vahaan par kaaphi duusare ladke bhi aayaa karte the
 Although what they did and did not do, we have no idea about this
 unhone kaha ki hamen jo bhi pataa tha vah sab dilli police ko bataa diya tha
 On the film on the Batla House encounter, Suhail Anwar says that he is complete nonsense
 film to nahin dekhi he, lekin trailor dekha he
 Nothing has happened here as shown in it
 encounter vaale flats se thik neeche teesri manzil par 106 number ke flats rah rahe faisal batt bataate hai ki vah abhi do maheene pehle hi yahaan rahane aae hai
 Although he knows about the Batla House encounter, he has never dared to visit that flat
 vah kehete hai ki ham kashmir se hai, is tarah kii ghatana vahaan par har roj hoti he

 The nation is proud of our heroic army ati sakriy jairam ramesh ne gramin vikaas mantralay main mahaj do hafte ke dauraan hi vivaadaaspad bhoomi adhigrahan or punaruddhar tathaa punarvaas vidheyak kaa nayaa masauda pesh kar diya
 But if the initial reaction of the UPA coalition parties and other parties within the Congress on this bill is considered a signal, it may take a long time to get it passed in Parliament
 ab janata ke sujhaavon-mashvire ke liye pesh prastaavit vidheyak kii raah main pehali aadchan upie kii saajheedaar mamata banerjee hai
 There is a public debate on this before it is introduced in Parliament
 ramesh pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri ko vidheyak ke apane sanskaran ke bare main samajhane ke liye 30 july ko khaas taur par kolkata gaye the
 But Banerjee is not ready to agree on this
 unhone kaha, ''maine pehle vaale bhoomi adhigrahan ke masauda vidheyak kaa virodh kiya tha
 We will support this bill only if they incorporate our suggestions
 '' is par ramesh ne kaha ki ve masaude main pherbadal ke liye taiyaar hai
 Ramesh's draft bill is completely different from his predecessor's version
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki isamen do muddon-bhoomi adhigrahan or punaruddhar evam punarvaas (arandar) ko ek kanoon main mila diya diya he
 Ramesh writes in the preamble to this draft: "the absence of both R&R and land acquisition in one law risks the neglect of revival and rehabilitation
 ''darasal abhi tak kaa yahi anubhav rahaa he
 More importantly, the new draft also provides compensation for those who are completely dependent on the land to be acquired for their livelihood
 isse trinmul congress khush ho gai he
 Debabrata Bandyopadhyay, former West Bengal Secretary of Land and Land Revenue, says, "there is an important difference to take into consideration both the price of the land and the livelihood
" '' bandyopadhyaay ab us do sadasyeey samiti ke pramukh hai jo rajya kii bhoomi niti taiyaar karegi
 "compensation proposals are also very good," he says
 ''masauda vidheyak ke mutabik, gramin ilaakon main adhigrahit kii jane vaali bhoomi kaa muaavja bazaar dar se chah guna se kam nahin hoga
 In urban areas it will not be less than twice the real market rate
 arandar package main yah vyavastha he ki prabhavit hone vaale parivaar ko 12 maheene tak prati maah 3,000 ru
 Received alimony
 iske alaava, 20 varshon tak prati parivaar prati maah 2,000 ru
 There will be an annual stipend in which inflation will be taken care of
 prabhavit pariwaron ko ek baar 50,000 ru
 Freight allowance of Rs
 agar adhigrahit jameen 10 saal ke bheetar duusari party ko bech di jaae to badi hui keemat kaa 20 fisadi hissaa mul maalikon ko diya jayega
 The bill provides that one member of the affected family should be given employment or in the absence of employment, Rs 2 lakh
 die jaaen
 This system is not in accordance with Rahul Gandhi's promise that it is necessary to provide employment to all the families affected by land acquisition
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki gandhi is praavdhaan main badlaav kii maang karte hai yaa nahin
 There are other controversial issues as well
 vidheyak main praavdhaan he ki sarkaar nijee companiyon ke liye bhoomi adhigrahit kar sakati he, basharte uskaa saarvajanik uddeshy ke liye istemaal kiya jaae
 Land use for infrastructure and industry has been included in the public purpose
 sarkaar ko keval 80 fisadi prabhavit jameen maalikon kii manjuuri leni hogi
 The Trinamool Congress is not happy with this
 bandyopadhyaay kehete hai, ''ham kisi nijee company ke liye rattibar jameen bhi adhigrahit karne kaa samarthan nahin karte
 "the state government will insist on getting the approval of 100 per cent of the people who lost the land," says Ramdas Meena, the land reform commissioner of West Bengal
 ''vidheyak main kai fasal dene vaali sinchit bhoomi ke adhigrahan kii manaahi kii gai he, jisase haryana main chintaa he
 "the whole of North India is fertile," says a senior state official
 iskaa haryana main bahut kharaab asar hoga
 "economist Bibek Debroy agrees with his view:" It is driven more by political compulsions than economic reasoning
 jameen kii gunvattta sabase zyada bazaar bhav main najar aati he
 The ruling Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) of Uttar Pradesh, which was at the center of the land acquisition dispute in Noida and Greater Noida, issued a statement on 2 August criticizing the draft bill of the Center
 usne rajya kii apni bhoomi adhigrahan niti kaa bachaav kiya, jisamen bhoomi kaa muaavja aapasi rajamandi se tay karne kii ijaajat he jabaki ramesh ke vidheyak main sarkari formule kaa prastaav he
 The draft bill of the Center will only make land acquisition impossible for Uttar Pradesh under the 'emergency Clause'
 is upbandh ke tahat sarkaar kisaanon se salaah-mashvire ko nazarandaaj kar sakati he
 Ramesh would need the explicit support of the Trinamool Congress and possibly the BSP to get this bill passed in Parliament
 lekin sadan main rakhe jane tak is vidheyak kaa rup shaayad badal chukaa hoga
 -partha Dasgupta, Arvind Chhabra and Ashutosh Mishranya Land Bill: The characteristics and flaws The four most important parts of the new Land Acquisition Bill created by the Ministry of Rural Development, Government's role in land acquisition, farmers' consent, compensation rules and norms and revival and rehabilitation The role of the government is related to the package * Government only use or public its stated Ddeshy sake will acquire land for the private sector
 * sarkaar ko nijee uddeshyon kii khatir nijee companiyon ke liye yaa saarvajanik uddeshyon ke liye bahufasali sinchit bhoomi lene kii ijaajat nahin
 Good: The government has clarified what the public purpose is within a time frame

 The commission team found that the child's father was sleeping in the same room
 kamare main kai sari khaali sharaab kii bottlen padi hui thim
 This year, serial blasts in many cities of the country including the capital Delhi have taken away the peace of the people
 aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai ke liye or kade kanoonon or pukhta suraksha-vyavastha kii baat kii ja rahi he
 On the other hand, Mumbai is still playing the game of getting a safe haven without any necessary documents by taking just commission amount
 kamishan ke is khel main agent aatankwaadiyon ko bhi panaah dilava rahe hai
 All the bomb blasts in Mumbai since 1993, the police got their clues from Mira Road area of mumbai itself
 har baar sandigdh aropiyon kii talash main mumbai police or khufia agenciyaan isi ilaake main chaape maarthi rahi hai
 That's why 'aaj Tak' tried to know in this area of mumbai how many papad has to be made to make a place here
 yahaan kiraye kaa flats lene ke liye aaj tak kii team ne mira road kii ek real estate agency se sampark saadhaa
 The agency gave the number of an agent named Salim
 saleem se mulaakaat hui, to usne palak jhapakate hi dikhaaya diya govindnagar ilaake main bahumanjili imaarat kaa ek flats or shuru ho gai kiraye ke flats kii dling
 After fixing the rate and advance of the flat, it came to an agreement
 saleem naam ke agent ko saaf-saaf bataa diya gaya ki hamaare paas apni pahchaan sabit karne ke liye koi document nahin he
 On this, Salim said that he should give the agreement of five hundred rupees
 baaki sab mere upar chhod den
 Salim took eight hundred rupees as token money and confirmed the deal by talking to the landlord over the phone
 is deal ne yah bhi sabit kar diya ki yahaan kirayedar kii pahchaan myne nahin rakhti
 Those who rent flats are meant only by their commission
 kamishan mili, to ve kisi aatankwaadi ko bhi kiraye kaa flats dilava sakate hai
 They have great confidence in their setting
 inhen maaloom he ki wo kirayedar kaa naam-pataa jo bhi bataa denge, police use aankh mundakar sahi maan legi
 In Mumbai's Mira Road area, a network of property dealers and real estate agents spread
 jagah-jagah dukaane kholkar baithe ye dalal kamishan ke chakkar main sirf thikaana muhaiyaa nahin karaate, balki thikaane ke saath hi de dete hai sharafat kaa certificate
 They get the house on rent without knowing anyone's name and by preparing fake documents, they arrange to protect them from the police's eyes
 mira road ke govindnagar main agar saleem jaise agent hai, to isi ilaake main he super estate agency
 In the presence of the police, the agent who told the rent of the flat has not yet considered it necessary to ask for the name and address of our team
 yahaan bhi flats ke kiraye ko lekar saudebaazi to hui, lekin agent ne pahchaan poochne kii himakat nahin kii
 Many foreigners were seen walking in this area in suspicious condition
 agent ne bataaya ki yahaan nigeria ke kai log najayas dhang se rah rahe hai
 The agent also proudly told that he is the boss of those who rent flats here
 is agent ne daawey ke saath kaha ki vah kirayedari ke saare kagajaat khud taiyaar karvaa legaa
 He claimed that he would get a letter written by a leader that these are our lives
 ab yah bataane kii zarurat nahin rah jaati he ki aakhir mumbai main har dhamaake ke baad police ke haath lagane vaale suraag mira road kii taraf hi kyon jate hai
 Hotel Cheap or Three Star
 mumbai main donon ke taur-tareeke ek jaise hi hai
 Anybody can come here whenever he wants and can make his home
 ab jab hotel main aane vaale se uski pahchaan nahin poochi jaati, to bhala ye koun poochhega ki yahaan aane vaale kaa makasad kya he
 a hotel is the easiest place in any city for an unknown person
 mumbai main pichley aatankwaadi hamalon or dilli serial blast ke baad hotalon main thaharne waalon kii nigaraanee kaise kii ja rahi he, yah jaanane ke liye bhi ajtak kii team mumbai ke ek thri star hotel main pahunchi
 After coming to this hotel, i realized how easy it is for anyone to take shelter here
 hotel ke booking counter par baithe karmchaaree ko sirf paison se matlab he
 Give any Indian money, give it to Pakistan or anyone
 hotel kaa staff yahaan thaharne waalon kii pahchaan nahin poochta
 He has not even asked the team till date about showing passport or any other identity card
 uskaa maathaa hamaare is sawaal par bhi nahin thanka ki hotel main koi aadmi kitne din tak ruk saktaa he
 This game of property dealers is very dangerous
 ve apane kamishan ke chakkar main bina pahchaan puche logon ko kirayedar bana rahe hai
 Due to some such agent, Karimullah was the culprit of the 1993 Mumbai serial blast in Nalasopara area adjoining Mumbai for many years
 mumbai dhamaakon ke baad karimullah pakistan bhaag gaya tha
 The Mumbai police declared him most wanted and thought that Karimullah might return with his mentor Dawood Ibrahim
 lekin, aisa hua nahin
 Karimullah returned to Mumbai again with the eyes of the intelligence agencies
 kai saal se vah nalasopara ke isi makaan main rah rahaa tha
 The Most Wanted Karimullah of Mumbai was living under the Mumbai Police's nose and the police had also given him the NOC
 mumbai main kirayedaron ke police veriphication kii pole kholane vaali is ghatana ke baavjood naa to farji dastauez taiyaar karwaane vaale real estate agenton ke khilaaf koi karrwai hui or naa hi estate agenton ko ye khyaal aayaa ki wo apni jeb bharne ke chakkar main puure mumbai kii aasteen main saanp paal rahe hai
 Aaj Tak had earlier warned that Mumbai is on the target of terrorists
 is sting oparation kaa makasad bhi police, khufia agenciyon or mumbai ke logon ko alert karnaa hi he ki unke pados ke kisi makaan yaa hotel main aatankwaadi badi aasaani se apana adda bana sakate hai
 Amchi Mumbai desh kii arthvyavastha kii ridh or aatankwaadiyon kaa sabase pasandida thikaana
 Terrorists are repeatedly targeting Mumbai
 lekin bam dhamaakon kii awaz se bhi is shahar ke paharedaaron kii neend nahin khuli he
 In the glow of money, people suppress landmine
 mumbai main daulat kii khanak main gum ho jaati he dhamaakon kii gunj, ye aap dekhenge to dang rah jaaenge
 Chaos erupted at Mumbai's Kurla railway station when people came to know that a bag on a platform number eight had left a child of about 15 days

 police dhara 317 ke tahat maamla darj kar jaanch main jute gai he
 At the same time, the police is also investigating whether this boy selling nail polish did not bring this child away and if he did not steal, then who is the woman who left that child in the bag
