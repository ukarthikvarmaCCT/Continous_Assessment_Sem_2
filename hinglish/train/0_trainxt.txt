 This festival of Shani Jayanti is on Saturday this time
 ek taraf jahaan shani jayanti shanivaar ko padi he vahiin is din 8 taarikh he
 The 8 digit is considered to be the sign of Saturn which contains all the powers of Saturn
 vahiin is din sarvaarth siddhi va amrit yoga ke saath hi rohinee nakshatra kaa adbhut sanyog bhi kai varsh baad ban rahaa he
 According to astrologers, the people affected by Shani on this day will get special benefit of worship
 shani kaise laaegaa khushhaalijyotishiyon kaa kahana he ki is jayanti par agar shani se jude daan kar kuch mantron kaa jaap kar liya jaae to badhate karj se mukti paane main madad milegi
 Victories will be won over enemies and illnesses that have become life-threatening will be cured
 jo jataka sadhesati, dhaiyya ke prabhaav ke saath hi shani kii mahadasha va antardasha yaa janm kundalee main shani ke visham prabhaav ke hone se pareshaan hai, shani jayanti par shani dev kaa tel se abhishek karne bhar se unhen mil jaaegi raahat
 To say that Shani Dev is Suryaputra but Shani was never formed from father Sun
 itnaa hi nahin, ek baar to shanidev ko maa ke prakope ko bhi jhelana padaa
 After which Shani Dev's move changed
 nyaay ke devtaa shani, kalyug ke devtaa shani, apni tedi chaal se sabko daraane vaale shani or sarson ke tel se prasann hone vaale shani maharaj ko vaidic jyotish main behad ahm mana jaataa he
 You can guess the importance of Shani in Sanatan Dharma from the same fact that Shani is considered not only a planet, but a god and also a justice of justice
 puranic kathaon ke mutabik, jyeshtha maheene main shanivaar kii amavasya ke din surya kii patni chaaya ne putr ko janm diya
 Those named - Shani
 surya jab apane putr ko dekhne pahunche to unke tej se jhulaskar shani kaa rang kaala pad gaya
 Surya realized his mistake but it was too late by then and Surya suffered immediately as a result
 apane putr shani ko nazar bhar dekhte hi surya kaa sara tej dhundhala pad gaya
 The sun began to eclipse, but it is said that since then the color of Saturn has become black forever
 sirf shani ke kaale rang kii hi nahin unki tedi chaal kii kahani bhi bahut anokhi he
 It is said that this story is related to the angry nature of Shani Maharaj
 kaha jaataa he ki shani jab balak the, to ek din unhone apni maa chaaya se bhojan maanga
 He kicked the shadow in anger when there was a delay in getting food
 shani kii is harakat se gussai chaaya ne unhen langadaa hone kaa shaap de diya
 It is said that since then the movement of Saturn has curved and his fear has increased
 lekin shanidev ne apni galatiyon se sabak sikhte hue ye pran liya ki kaliyug main koi bhi jhooth bolegaa yaa kisi ke saath anyaay hoga to wo shani ke coup kaa shikaar hoga
 This is the reason why their crooked gait prevents the devotees from committing wrongdoing and injustice
 shani se koun nahin darataa
 The fear of his selling vision is such that devotees are not able to see his eyes
 lekin agar ham ye kahen ki aaj aapke paas ye mauka he jab aap kaliyug ke devtaa se ankhen milakar maang lijie koi bhi vardaan to yakeen maniye shani aapako niraash nahin karenge
 Yes, there is a similar temple of Shani Dev in Chhindwara where devotees pray with their God by putting eyes in their eyes

 He said that in the last four years the economy of the country has grown very fast
 modi sarkaar kii nitiyon par janata ko bharosa he
 The proof of this is the victory of the party from UP to Tripura
 isliye vipaksh kaa avishvaas prastaav anaavashyak he
 Significantly, the no-confidence motion moved by the TDP MP was approved by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on Wednesday, after which Friday was set to be discussed
 rajnath singh ne kaha, 'duniya kaa har vyakti is sachai ko sweekaar karata he ki hamaare pradhanmantri ne bharat kii pratishtha ko antarrashtriya jagat main oonchai par pahunchaaya he
 After demonetisation, elections took place in the country's largest state UP and the people of UP formed the government by giving a clear majority to the Bharatiya Janata Party
 isse samajha ja saktaa he ki janata ko hamaari nitiyon main bharosa he
 'he said that many of our prominent mps have expressed concern about the country's economy, but whatever is there is clear like a mirror
 bharat is samay vishwa main sabase teji se badhane vaali arthvyavastha he
 The IMF also said that India's growth rate is growing at a rate as fast as India's economy

 He said, "four years ago, India was ranked ninth in the world economy, but within four years today it has stood at the sixth position
 2030 tak aate-aate ham duniya kii top 3 iconomi main shaamil ho jaaenge

 In the crucial match of the IPL between Hyderabad Sunrisers and Royal Challengers Bangalore, Bangalore's hopes will largely depend on AB de Villiers
 isaki sabase badi vajah yah he ki abi divilliars maujuuda samay ke sabase visphotak ballebaaz hai, jo kisi bhi gendbaaz kii kisi bhi gend ko boundry se baahar bhej sakate hai
 Some of his shots are going to surprise even the cricket experts
 yakeen nahin ho abi divilliars ke kuch shots kii jhalak dekhie
 Even if a fast bowler like Dale Steyn or Andre Russell is putting a perfectly accurate yorker on the middle stump, AB de Villiers can loft him and hit a six off the extra cover
 of stump se baahar jaati gend ko abi divilliars sweep shots ke jariye midwicket se baahar bhej sakate hai
 Even if there is a wide ball, he can hit a six over the bowler
 gendbaaz agar chaturaai dikhaate hue dhimi or short gend phenke, to long of se baahar bhej sakate hai abi divilliars
 Good length ball with short fine leg can be sent out for sixes
 abi divilliars kii tufaani ballebaazi ne unke kai signechar shots ijad kar die hai
 One of them is lap shots
 gendbaaj ke haath se gend chhootane se pehle hi divilliars krij ke thode andar ho jate hai, jisase unhen gend ko bhaanpane ke liye atirikt samay mil jaataa he or ek paanv par baithte hue oochaal bhari gendon par sweep shots khel pate hai
 The comments dakshin africa cricketer jaik kallis ke mutabik divilliars kaa ye shot cricket ko aage badhanaa vaala he or isane scoring ke nae tareeke ko talasha he
 In this manner, de Villiers also plays scoop shots on any ball
 in shots kaa hi asar he ki abi divilliars ko total 360 degree batsman mana jaataa he, yani divilliars jab ballebaazi karne utre hon to aap ekadam achraj bhare shots dekhne ko taiyaar rahiye
 There are also shots which will not be seen in the coaching manuel
 divilliars kii ballebaazi ke chalate vipakshi captain or gendbaazi ko apni ranneeti badalani padati he
 De Villiers is seen as a human from another planet due to his speed and reflexes
 divilliars kii ek badi khaasiyat yah bhi he ki ve spin or tej gendbaazi ko ek hi andaaz main aasaani se khilne main maharath rakhte hai
 All these shots de Villiers can play, only because of his balance inside the crease and because of his self-control
 yahi vajah he ki unhen aadhunik cricket kaa superman mana jaataa he
 The biggest reason for this is that AB de Villiers is the most explosive batsman of the present time, who can send any ball of any bowler out of the boundary
 unke kuch shots to cricket ke visheshgyon ko bhi achambhe main daalane vaale hai
 Not sure, catch a glimpse of some shots of AB de Villiers
 del sten yaa phir andre rasel jaisaa tej gendbaaz middle stump par ekadam sateek yorker daal rahe hon, to bhi abi divilliars use loft karke extra cover se chakka maar sakate hai
 AB de Villiers can send the ball out of the off stump out of midwicket through sweep shots
 wide gend ho to bhi use gendbaaz ke upar chakka maar sakate hai
 AB de Villiers can be sent out from long off if the bowler bowls slow and short balls while showing cleverness
 acchhee length kii gend ko short fine leg se chakke ke liye baahar bhej sakate hai
 AB de Villiers' stormy batting has evoked many of his signature shots
 inamen ek he lap shots
 De Villiers gets inside the crease just before the bowler misses the ball, giving him extra time to catch the ball and play sweep shots on bouncy balls while sitting on one leg
 tippaniyan According to South African cricketer Jack Kallis, this shot of de Villiers is about to advance cricket and it has explored a new way of scoring
 is tareeke se divilliars kisi bhi gend par schoop shots bhi khel lete hai
 The effect of these shots is that AB de Villiers is considered to be a total 360 degree batsman, that is, when de Villiers has come out to bat, you should be ready to see very surprising shots
 aise shots bhi jo koching manuel main bhi nahin najar aaenge
 Due to De Villiers' batting, the opposition captain and bowling have to change their strategy
 divilliars apni speed or riflexes kii badaulat kisi duusare grah ke insaan ke taur par najar aate hai
 a big feature of de Villiers is that he specializes in spin and fast bowling with ease in the same style
 ye sab shots divilliars khel pate hai, to keval krij ke andar apane santulan kii vajah se or khud par apane aatmaniyantran ke boote
 This is the reason why he is considered the superman of modern cricket

 gendbaaj ke haath se gend chhootane se pehle hi divilliars krij ke thode andar ho jate hai, jisase unhen gend ko bhaanpane ke liye atirikt samay mil jaataa he or ek paanv par baithte hue oochaal bhari gendon par sweep shots khel pate hai
 The comments dakshin africa cricketer jaik kallis ke mutabik divilliars kaa ye shot cricket ko aage badhanaa vaala he or isane scoring ke nae tareeke ko talasha he
 In this manner, de Villiers also plays scoop shots on any ball
 in shots kaa hi asar he ki abi divilliars ko total 360 degree batsman mana jaataa he, yani divilliars jab ballebaazi karne utre hon to aap ekadam achraj bhare shots dekhne ko taiyaar rahiye
 There are also shots which will not be seen in the coaching manuel
 divilliars kii ballebaazi ke chalate vipakshi captain or gendbaazi ko apni ranneeti badalani padati he
 De Villiers is seen as a human from another planet due to his speed and reflexes
 divilliars kii ek badi khaasiyat yah bhi he ki ve spin or tej gendbaazi ko ek hi andaaz main aasaani se khilne main maharath rakhte hai
 All these shots de Villiers can play, only because of his balance inside the crease and because of his self-control
 yahi vajah he ki unhen aadhunik cricket kaa superman mana jaataa he
 According to South African cricketer Jack Kallis, this shot of de Villiers is about to advance cricket and it has explored a new way of scoring
 is tareeke se divilliars kisi bhi gend par schoop shots bhi khel lete hai
 The effect of these shots is that AB de Villiers is considered to be a total 360 degree batsman, that is, when de Villiers has come out to bat, you should be ready to see very surprising shots
 aise shots bhi jo koching manuel main bhi nahin najar aaenge
 Due to De Villiers' batting, the opposition captain and bowling have to change their strategy
 divilliars apni speed or riflexes kii badaulat kisi duusare grah ke insaan ke taur par najar aate hai
 a big feature of de Villiers is that he specializes in spin and fast bowling with ease in the same style
 ye sab shots divilliars khel pate hai, to keval krij ke andar apane santulan kii vajah se or khud par apane aatmaniyantran ke boote
 This is the reason why he is considered the superman of modern cricket
 divilliars kii ballebaazi ke chalate vipakshi captain or gendbaazi ko apni ranneeti badalani padati he

 Inventive life In truth, i did not feel much in school
 vahaan kitaabi padhai par zyada or practical par bahut kam jor diya jaataa tha
 But when i was studying for msc, i started having fun
 main hameshaa nae project ke bare main sochataa or khud ko hi chunauti detaa rahata tha
 i explored various aspects of biology, in which my interest became intense and i began to explore more new things in that field
 jab main peeche mudakar dekhtaa hum to yah mahasoos karata hum ki ek vaigyanik ke liye sabase acchhee baat yah hoti he ki vah hameshaa kuch nayaa khojane main laga rahata he
 It is a unique feeling in itself

 My Research When i was returning to India from Stanford in 1990, i used to think deeply about the subject of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
 main isaki jatil banaavat ko achche dhang se samajhane ke liye behatar clinical or biological mix ko istemaal karnaa chahta tha
 The discovery part of my research is now over
 ab ham iske transleshan part yaa parivartit karne par kaam kar rahe hai or pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki ham kis tarah tuberculosis ke khaas anzimes ko nishaanaa banane ke liye moulicules kaa utpaadan kar sakate hai
 At the same time, we are also trying to know whether it can be used in making safe medicines for humans
 maine leukoderma par bhi kuch kaam shuru kiya he
 i think there is a lot of scope to work in this field
 main is beemaari kii vajahon ko gaharaai se samajhnaa chahta hum
 It took me four years to complete my tuberculosis research work
 pehle to isse bahut niraashaa hui, lekin baad main mujhe ehsaas hua ki asafalataa sweekaar karnaa jaruri he, lekin saath hi koshishen bhi jari rakhane chahie
 i understand that participating in sports proved very useful for me in childhood
 usee vajah se mere andar sakaaratmak najariya aayaa
 i learned from sports that you may not win today, but one day you will definitely win

 pradhanmantri narendra modi pashchim asian deshon kii yatra par hai
 After Jordan, Modi is going to Palestine today
 narendra modi aise pehle pradhanmantri hai jinhone isroyal kii bhi yatra kii he or ab philistin pahunch rahe hai
 Palestine was liberated 30 years ago and India was one of the first countries to recognize Palestine's independence and sovereignty
 lekin ab tak desh kaa koi bhi piem philistin tak nahin pahunch paaya
 Although the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited Gaza in 1960, Palestine was non-existent then
 isroyal-philistin jane vaale pehle piemaye ajeeb ittfa he ki bharat ke rishte philistin se bahut achche rahe hai, lekin modi se pehle kisi pradhanmantri ne vahaan jane kii jahamat nahin uthaai
 This is similar to how no prime minister had ever visited Israel in Israel's 70 years of existence and last year PM Modi went to where he was warmly welcomed
 itnaa hi nahin, iske mahaj 6 maheene baad hi isroyal ke pradhanmantri benjamin netanyahu bharat daure par pahunch gaye
 The bloody conflict between Israel and Palestine is the two neighboring countries in the history of the world, whose borders are undiscovered with the blood of so many citizens and who do not like each other
 gaja pattee ko lekar donon mulkon main hameshaa se vivaad rahaa he
 But now in the form of PM Modi, at least the Palestinians see a ray of hope
 philistin ke raashtrapati mehboob abbaas ne modi kii yatra se pehle kaha he ki 'ham pradhanmantri narendra modi kii aitihaasik yatra se bhav-vibhor hai
 This visit will express the strength of fraternal relations between the people of India and Israel
 ham shanti prakriya kii taaja gatividhi or donon deshon ke dwipaksheeya sambandhon par bhi pradhanmantri modi se baat karenge
 'the United States declared Palestine with the UN a few months ago, the United States declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel
 ye elaan philistin kii samprabhutaa or swatantra desh kii manyata par chot thi
 But India supported Palestine on this issue despite a deep and close friendship with the US and Israel
 sanyukt raashtra main is par 128 deshon ne jerusalem par isroyal kii manyata ko khaarij kiya, jinamein bharat bhi shaamil tha
 But the Modi government did not let Israel get angry with this move
 isi saal janvari main jab isroyal ke piem benjamin netanyahu bharat kii yatra par aae to usamen piem modi ke kadam kii tis najar nahin ai
 Netanyahu said in his statement that one vote does not change the relationship
 piem modi kii ye philistin yatra kootneeti se zyada maanviya pahaluon ko ujagar karti he
 Among the issues that will be discussed there during this visit, emphasis will be on health, education, culture and strengthening of women
 apane is daure main piem modi philistin ke alaava jordan, yuai or oman bhi ja rahe hai, jise piem modi kii arab diplomasi ke rup main bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 Strengthening relations with these Gulf countries will also help India to weaken Pakistan's penetration in Arab countries
 teesraa morcha banane kii kavayad shuru to ho gai he lekin yah mul rup se narendra modi kaa virodh karne ke liye hota dikh rahaa he
 On Wednesday, 14 parties held a meeting in Delhi under the umbrella of the Left parties, which was described as anti-communalism
 in dalon ne sampradayikta ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai or bijepi ke pradhan mantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi par sidhaa hamalaa bolaa
 But he did not say anything about the ruling Congress while there were some parties which are extremely anti-congress
 dilachasp baat yah he ki sharad pavaar kii party ensipi ne bhi isamen bhaag liya
 Actually, the Left parties have made an exercise to form a third front on the pretext of opposing communalism
 buudhvaar ko jin partiyon ne is baithak main bhaag liya unki lok sabha main 101 siten hai
 In this meeting, no party criticized the ruling Congress
 unhone mahangaai, bhrashtachar jaisai jwalanth muddon par koi baat nahin kii
 Representatives of all parties criticized only BJP and Modi
 sabase zyada uttejit to nitish kumaar the jinhone modi par jabardast hamalaa bolaa
 He called upon all parties to fight communalism, fascism mentality and terrorism
 is baithak main bhaag lene vaale dalon kii yah bhi koshish rahi ki unhen ek gut ke taur par na dekha jaae
 He looked eager to maintain his separate identity
 matlab he ki ve lok sabha chunaav ke baad apane vikalp khule rakhana chaahate hai taaki baad main ve kisi bhi morche main shaamil ho saken
 Nitish Kumar also distanced himself from the Third Front
 seetaram yechuri ne bhi tisare morche kii tatkaal sambhaavna se inkaar kar diya he
 Let us tell you that last week, Delhi High Court also said that the number of monkeys in Delhi is constantly increasing
 court ne dilli sarkaar se kaha tha ki is samasya se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye vah yojana taiyaar kare
 Along with this, the High Court also asked the Union Environment Ministry to make necessary arrangements for the Delhi government to deal with this problem
 dilli sarkaar ne adaalat main rakhi states report main kaha tha ki dilli ke 25000 bandaron ko pakadaney or unka bandhyakaran karne ke liye use lagbhag 23 karod 50 lakh rupee chahie
 Some of the accused in the Yashwant Sonwane murder case have alleged in their statements before the police that when the officer saw oil adulteration in Manmad on January 25, he demanded a bribe to settle the case
 haalanki police ne kaha ki is tarah ke aarope aam baat hai
 The investigating officer recorded the statements of the 10 accused detained
 police ke mutabik pramukh aaropee popat scindia kaa bayaan abhi darj nahin kiya gaya he
 Popat's son Kunal Shinde alleged in his statement that Additional Collector Sonawane had demanded a large bribe to settle the case at Sagar Dhaba near Manmad
 nasik ke police adheekshak milind bharambe ne kaha, ‘kuch aarope hai
 
 lekin aaropee khud ke bachaav main aamtaur par is tarah ke bayaan dete hai
 We are investigating the case from all angles
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ye aarope maamle ko kamjor karenge
 i cannot say anything further because it is a very sensitive matter

 mujffarpur balika grih maamle main ek or kirdaar abhi gaayab he
 He is Madhu
 shysta parveen se madhu banane kii uski kahani bhi kaaphi dilachasp he
 She is currently considered the main character in the Muzaffarpur girl child rape case
 sanstha main brajesh ke baad nirnay lene kaa adhikaar usee ke paas tha
 The Bihar police have not been able to find him
 ab sibiai uski talash main lagi he
 If you get that, many secrets will open
 haalanki uske khilaaf koi exiaar darj nahin he, lekin vah is puure prakaran kii mahatvapurn kadi he
 Before meeting Brajesh Thakurse, Madhu alias Shaista Parveen used to live in the infamous Gali quadrilateral area of muzaffarpur
 usee ilaake ke laalaten pattee main uskaa ghar tha
 She was married to Chand Muhammad in 1998
 ek beti bhi he, lekin nashe kii lat kii vajah se teen saal baad madhu ne apane pati ko chhod diya
 In the same period, Deepika Suri is posted as ASP in Muzaffarpur
 deepika suri ne shahar ke badnaam gali laalaten pattee ke red lite ilaake main gandagi main fansi mahilaon ke punarvaas kaa kaam shuru kiya tha, jisaki charchaa puure desh main hui thi
 They liberated some girls from the captivity of touts and arranged for the education of their children
 ye daur 2001 kaa tha
 In the same period, Brajesh Thakur met Madhu
 madhu or brajesh ne milakar red lite ilaake main isi kaam ko aage badhaane kaa faisla kiya or vahiin se enjio seva sakalp evam vikaas samiti kaa janm hota he
 Its actor was Brajesh Thakur
 madhu ke kaaran red lite aria main kaam karne main brajesh thakur ko koi dikkat nahin hoti thi
 Madhu Kumari and Brajesh together formed a group of 50 women
 usee samooh kii binah par kaushal vikaas or liveli hud kaa prashikshan dene ke naam par sarkaar se kai yojanaayen bhi leen
 After that the work of this NGO increased
 is sanstha ko aids control socity se 2003 main red lite aria main kaam karne kaa mauka mila
 In this, the work of spreading awareness about AIDS in women was started
 in saare kaamon main jila prashasan or aids control socity kaa puraa sahyog rahata tha
 At the same time, Madhu started the institution by the name of Vama Shakti Vahini
 madhu kii badaulat aids control socity main brajesh kaa prabhaav badhata gaya
 Madhu's influence increased so much that the society continued to hold meetings for the project
 jisamen madhu jarur aati thi
 Gradually, the ngos of Madhu and Brajesh Thakur established a kind of control over the AIDS Control Society
 brajesh or madhu kii jodi kaa aisa prabhaav adhikariyon par tha ki bataaya jaataa he ki 2004 main ek adhikari ne is sanstha ko bihar kii sabase acha kaam karne vaali sanstha qaraar diya
 Around this time, his faces gave him the name Madhu
 aids control socity main kaaphi dinon tak inkaa kaam chalata rahaa
 New new projects were found in new new cities
 isi bich aids control socity ke adhikari jab samaaj kalyaan main posting lekar pahunche tab madhu or brajesh kii jodi ne yahaan bhi kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 Since 2013, i got the job of running a girl child mainly
 phir to samaaj kalyaan vibhaag ke kai project milane shuru ho gaye
 The officers also admired him
 is bich aids control socity kaa bhi kaam chalata rahaa
 In 2016, an officer in the AIDS Control Society did not come under his influence and he was transferred in a few days
 madhu vama shakti vahini kii diarector ban gai
 His organization is still working in Muzaffarpur and Bettiah
 ishk kii dukaan band hellekhakah narendra sainiprakashakah vaanikimatah 225 ru
 If it is about men and women love, then it will go to the body
 man ke saath-saath jab tan bhi miltaa he to prem pragadh ho jaataa he
 Narendra Saini understands this truth very well that whatever may have been the inspiration for the beginning of love - it is only up to the body to reach late
 in kahaniyon main ve jis shiddat ke saath ishk kii baat karte hai, usee shiddat ke saath sharir kii bhi
 If they talk about heart-to-heart relationship with depth, then they do not hesitate to extend the expression of this relationship through sex
 aisa kar narendra na sirf kai varjanaaon ko todate hai balki ek bada khatra bhi uthaate hai
 The danger is because sex is still forbidden in Hindi literature
 hindi kahaniyon-upanyaason main man to khub mili hai par tan ke milan par bilkul khamoshi he
 Barring a few writers, no one could muster the courage to break this wall of taboo, but they have effectively broken this wall of taboo in their stories
 ishk kii dukaan band he main kul aath kahaniyaan hai
 Everyone's heroines are very brave, matured and bold
 bilkul sharathchandra kii nayikaon kii tarah lekin badalte jamaane ke hisaab se unki bahaduree, macurity or boldnes kaa sandarbh bhi badla he
 The body because of which the male society considers them "things", they have learned to teach a lesson by making that body a weapon (the bastard), the lover who has to sacrifice his body, mind and wealth to stand on his feet
 Does, it does not take even a moment for her to decide to reject him when the same lover betrays him (kasak-e-ishq), when he realizes that the relationship is not built on the basis of the truth, then the foundation of the lie Neither is that awe Shin Khati (deadline), the boy she used to kill, when she wears relationships on the scales of religion, does not take any time to push her (ayesha), she has no hesitation in telling her male friends that she Is lesbian (ik girl unknown)
 narendra kii nayikaayen is baat ko sabit karti hai ki ''ladkiyaan condom kii tarah nahin hoti hai" (''ek adhuri diary kii chand satren" kahani kaa nayak ladakiyon ko condom kii tarah hi samajhataa he) ve pyaar karti hai to sachmuch dil se karti hai
 Her dedication is inspiring but when she comes to teach a lesson, there is hardly anyone more dangerous and cruel than her
 ve apane premi ko ghar se nanga bhi bhaga sakati hai (bastard)
 The heroes of Narendra's stories are ordinary men
 aise purush jinhen ladakiyon main sirf jism dikhataa he
 In these stories, it is only the present-day men of the society — whether you call it a hero or a villain — whose face, even if it is a sharafat, keeps their eyes groaning
 narendra kii kahaniyon main bhi yahi kirdaar hai
 a whitewash is hidden inside every man - in his primitive and cruel form
 safediwala vah khalanaayak he, jisane 12 saal kii ladki ke saath balaatkaar kiya tha (ek adhuri diary kii chand satren)
 "ayesha" is a story in this collection, which reveals the cruel truth of society under the pretext of love
 kisi ladki kii deh bhogate vakt uskaa dharm aade nahin aata lekin jab uske ghar kaa pani pinaa hota he to majahab diwaar banakar khadaa ho jaataa he
 "the Girl with the Metro" story excels in both content and imagination
 purush kii kaamana kaa bejod chithran he
 This story also gives the message that when love comes from body, it does not last long
 is kii nayika urvashi kahati he, ''ab tumhen meri nahin, ek jism kii jarurat he
 Which you can ignore and laugh in your own way
 "sangrah kii sari kahaniyon kii khaasiyat unka clymex he
 The climax of every story is startling
 pathak ko andar tak hilaa detaa he

 Gandhi reminded the President that former President Kalam was always against hanging

 com / whpj4wot9t desh kii sabase puraani raajnneetik party congress abhi badlaav ke daur se guzar rahi he
 There have been many changes in the party after Rahul Gandhi's coronation as party president
 purv adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii raajnneetik sakriyata ab kam hui he or rahul frontroot par aakar party ko aage badha rahe hai
 Congratulating Rahul for becoming the party president, Sonia Gandhi has said that 'now he is also her boss'
 gauratlab he ki rahul gandhi ne 16 disambar, 2017 ko aadhikarik rup se congress adhyaksh pad kaa kaarybhaar sambhala tha
 Sonia has said in her statement that i hope the way the party workers worked as my president, they will work under the chairmanship of Rahul
 hamane gujarat chunaav or rajasthan upachunaav main kaaphi shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 i hope the party performs well in the upcoming Karnataka elections as well
 sonia ne modi sarkaar par bhi hamalaa kiya or kaha ki is sarkaar ko satta main aae chaar saal ho gaye hai
 And democracy has come under threat because of the constant government
 iskaa asar sansad, nyaaypalika, media or samaaj par bhi padaa he
 Sonia said that the situation of farmers in the country is getting worse
 sonia ne rojgaar ko lekar bhi modi sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Sonia had earlier said that after retiring as President, she had also said during that time that i am retired now
 haalanki, baad main party kii ore se kaha gaya tha ki vah sirf party adhyaksh ke rup main ritair hui hai, raajnneeti se nahin
 After Rahul became the party president, there was a big program in the party office
 us dauraan bhi sonia gandhi ne rahul gandhi kii jamkar tarif kii thi
 Sonia said that she is proud of Rahul's tolerance
 sonia boleen thi ki main ek maa ke taur par rahul kii tarif nahin karnaa chaahati
 i am proud of Rahul's tolerance for making him fearless and courageous
 raajnneeti main aane par rahul ne aise bhayankar vyaktigat hamale kaa saamana kiya jisane use or nidar insaan banaaya he
 He said that a new phase, a new leadership is expected of you
 " aapako bataa den ki sonia gandhi kareeb 19 saal tak congress kii adhyaksh rahi thim
 Sonia became the party president on 14 March 1998
 aapako bataa den ki party adhyaksh banane ke baad se rahul gandhi ne aakraamak rukh apanaaya he
 Now they attack the Modi government more aggressively than before
 phir chaahe vah soshal media ke jariye ho, reliyon main ho yaa phir media se batkar sarkaar ko gherna ho
 Rahul's strategy When the successful Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave a speech on Wednesday, the Congress worked on a new strategy
 bhaashan ke dauraan congress saansadon ne achaanak jor-jor se narebaaji shuru kar di
 This 'flash Protest' of the Congress surprised everyone
 sutron ke mutabik is ‘gorilla style’ virodh kii ranjaiti congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne hi banaai thi
 All party mps were asked to reach Lok Sabha by 12 noon
 sutron ke mutabik sadan main is tarah ke virodh ko lekar congress sansadeey dal kii pramukh sonia gandhi kuch hichak rahi thim lekin rahul ne apane sipahasalaron ko puri takat ke saath ‘muddon par aadhaarit’ narebaaji ke liye green signal diya
 Before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the Modi government has made a big bet of upper caste reservation, due to which the opposition is in a fix
 siyaasi najariye se dekha jaae to garib savarnon ke liye ghoshit aarakshan is varg kii naaraazgi ko dur karne kii bijepi kii ek koshish maani ja rahi he
 The Modi government will introduce the Constitution Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday to provide 10 percent upper caste reservation
 aarakshan ko lekar ek baar phir siyaasi bisaat bichaai jane lagi he
 The Constitution does not say about reservation on economic grounds
 or aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan dene ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan karnaa jaruri hoga
 With the stance of the parties on this proposal, the BJP will edge its strategy in the election field
 modi sarkaar ke savarna aarakshan daanv ko lekar abhi tak vipaksh kii ore se argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ne hi virodh jataayaa he
 Apart from this, other parties are seen standing in favor of upper caste reservation
 darasal congress se lekar sapa, basapa, algepi jaise raajnneetik dal garib savarna ko aarakshan dene kii vakaalat karte rahe hai
 In such a situation, these parties will not openly protest, but can surround the Modi government by questioning the timing and process of bringing it to the Lok Sabha
 standing cameti ko bhejne kii mangamodi sarkaar savarna aarakshan vidheyak ko loksabhaa main pesh karegi
 In view of the Lok Sabha elections, no political party will want to oppose it and buy the ire of the upper castes
 aise main samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ko standing cameti ke paas bhejne kii sifarish vipakshi dalon kii ore se kii ja sakati he
 However, the Modi government will not accept it
 sadan main charchasavarna aarakshan ko lekar satta paksh loksabhaa main charchaa kii baat karegaa, taaki is par sabhi kii raay saamne aae
 While the opposition accepts this, it is difficult to say
 haalanki modi sarkaar kii puri koshish hogi ki charchaa ke jariye savarna aarakshan par sabhi raajnneetik dalon kii raay saamne laai ja sake
 Regional parties can protest: The Modi government may also have to face opposition from regional parties in the House regarding the reservation
 argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ne iskaa virodh karke apane mansoobey jaahir kar die hai
 Not only this, the Apna Dal, an ally of NDA, has started talking about increasing the scope of OBC by 27 percent after the upper caste reservation
 iske alaava sapa or basapa bhi aabaadi ke lihaaj se aarakshan kii maang uthaa sakati he
 Apart from this, the issue of issuing caste census report can be revealed
 court se adngasavarna aarakshan ko lekar kuch log supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhata sakate hai
 Earlier, in the Narasimha Rao government, when it was recommended to give 10% upper caste reservation, the court had stayed
 iske alaava alpsankhyakon, jaaton, maraathon or rajasthan main brahmanon ke aarakshan kii sifarish ko court se jhatka lag chukaa he
 In such a situation, this bet of the Modi government may also get a shock from the court
 darasal desh main anusuchit jati (essi) or anusuchit janajati (asti) or anya pichhadaa varg (obisi) ko milakar 49
 There is a 5 percent reservation
 supreme court 1992 ke indira saahani ke apane faisle main saaf kar chukaa he ki kul aarakshan 50 fisadi se zyada nahin ho saktaa
 Despite this, reservation in some states like Tamil Nadu is more than this limit, whose case is going on in the Supreme Court
 aise main ye maamla bhi supreme court kii bhent chadh saktaa he
 There is at least one issue in UP on which all political opposition goes on the sidelines
 yah he vidhayakon kii selary kaa mudda
 UP mlas who get salary of Rs 50,000 every month and other allowances are worried about rising inflation
 guuruuvaar ko vidhansabha sadan main unki yah pareshaani chhalak padi
 From the ruling to the opposition mlas and ministers expressed their pain and even said that their cost is not going to be due to inflation
 ve apane yahaan aane vaale mehmaanon ko ek cap chaay tak nahin pilaa paa rahe hai
 BJP Legislature Party leader Hukum Singh said that the salary of mlas is half of the salary of officers
 yahi vajah he ki adhikari vidhayakon kii baat nahin sunate hai
 Hukum Singh's point was supported by senior Congress leader Pramod Tiwari
 tiwari kaaphi samay se vidhayakon ke vetan va bhatte main kam se kam 25 fisadi kii badhottaree karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 Expressing his anguish over the anguish of the mlas, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Azam Khan announced that the salary of the mlas will increase but how much it will increase will be decided after the meeting of the Speaker, Chief Minister and party leaders
 ajam ne kaha ki sarkaar vidhayakon ke vetan ko mulya suchakank se bhi jodgaye par vichaar karegi taaki vidhayakon ko unke sammaan ke anusaar vetan mili
 However, it is also worth noting that according to the affidavit given to the Election Commission during the last assembly elections, 67 percent of the 403 mlas of UP are crorepatis
 jammu kashmir ke traal main 5 aatankiyon ke chupe hone kii khabar aa rahi he
 According to sources, five terrorists of jaish-e-mohammed are hiding in the area
 sena inaki talash main search oparation chalaa rahi he
 Let us tell you that on Saturday, three terrorists were killed in Tral by security forces

 He said that on receiving information about the presence of terrorists, security forces conducted a siege and search operation
 iske baad tadake muthbhed shuru hui
 He said that the bodies of the three slain terrorists and their weapons have been recovered from the encounter site
 unhone kaha ki mrit aatankwaadiyon kii pahchaan abhi kii ja rahi he, ve jaish-e-mohammad sanghathan ke hai
 "the death of the terrorists is a major setback for this organization, which is trying to revive its activities in the Valley," the official said
 unhone kaha ki suraksha balon ko abhiyaan ke dauraan patharav kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa, lekin unhone isse nipatane ke liye adhiktam sanyam kaa parichay diya

 net / Chief Justice of India RM Lodha recently said that like the medical and health services in Jodhpur, the court will work 365 days
 justise lodha ke is bayaan ke baad kanoon kii duniya main nai bahes chhid gai he
 Some people believe that this should be done to reduce the number of pending cases, while a large section is against it
 baar council of india ne is bayaan kaa swaagat kiya he or deshbhar kii baar association se suzav maange hai
 Bari Council of India President Biri Singh Cincinnavar said, "we welcome it, but we want to know what will be the modalities of 365 days?" Questions have also started to arise about the number of judges between Lodha's statement and the discussions on this side
 saath hi yah ki agar hai court ke jajon ke varking days 210 hi rahenge to yah kaise sambhav ho sakegaa?gauratlab he ki hoicourt ke jajon ko 210 din kaam karnaa padataa he, jisamen unke avkaash bhi shaamil hai
 Apart from this, the judges get a separate holiday in winter and summer
 baar council of india chahta he agar 210 dinon main se cajual live hataa di jaae to kaam ke ghante bad sakate hai
 However, many famous lawyers of the country are against this thinking
 unka maananaa he ki vakaalat kaa pesha duusare peshon se alag he
 It takes a lot of brain effort and it can be dangerous for health if you do not get rest
 inkaa mat he ki court ko 365 din tak khole rakhane ke liye shift main chalaaya ja saktaa he
 Retired judges can also be put to good use in this

 The body also started twitching
 jogeshwar ne bete ko behoshee kii haalat main patna ke ek nijee aspataal main bhartee karaayaa
 Mandeep, who has been suffering from encephalitis, did not get any relief from the treatment which lasted for a month, however, Jogeshwar, who was able to pay his wages to the family, became a debtor of two lakh rupees from his relatives and friends
 bachche kii haalat jab or bigadgaye lagi to unhone ventilator se las ambulance kaa intjaam kiya or 20 june ko mandeep ko lekar gorakhpur ke baba raghav das (biardi) medical college pahunche
 Here, he was immediately admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) equipped with a ventilator
 visheshikrut ilaaj milane se mandeep kii haalat main sudhaar he
 Doctors are hopeful that Mandeep will be removed from ventilator and shifted to another ward in a few days
 kangaal ho chuke jogeshwar ke liye raahat yah bhi he ki yahaan unke bete kaa ilaaj muft main ho rahaa he
 Not only Mandeep, a total of 23 children, including 5-year-old Dulari of Kushinagar and 8-year-old Ansh at Gorakhpur Medical College, are on the verge of winning the battle against meningitis

 Hundreds of children die every year in Gorakhpur, Deoria, Basti, Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Siddharthanagar, Santkbir Nagar, Lakhimpur Kheri, Bahraich and Gonda
 par is baar halaat kuch badale hai
 In seven districts of Gorakhpur and Basti Mandal, which have been suffering from encephalitis for years, this time the outbreak of the disease has stopped
 gorakhpur medical college main dimagi bukhaar se peedit bacchon ke liye bana 71 ventilator yukt piisiu pichley varsh june main marijon se khachaakhach bharaa tha, is baar abhi aadhe se zyada bed khaali hai
 In August 2017, there was a sudden increase in meningitis patients in and around Gorakhpur
 uske baad se shuru hue sarkari prayaas ab rang laane lage hai
 So far this year, the number of meningitis patients has decreased by more than half (see graphics)

 State Government Health Minister Siddharthnath Singh says, "looking at the earlier government practices regarding prevention of meningitis, it was found that there is no guideline to treat such a dangerous disease
 iske baad mukhyamantri ne fouran visheshgyon kii ek team gathit kar guideline taiyaar karne ko kaha
 The guideline was prepared in December 2017 and a campaign to deal with encephalitis started accordingly (see box)
 siddharthanath singh bataate hai, ''teen str par kaary shuru hua
 Health services were first strengthened, by training all concerned officers and employees, made efficient and people were given treatment information through mass awareness programs in the affected areas
 '' mukhyamantri ne adhikariyon ko dimagi bukhaar ke marijon kaa 'pesheynt audit' karne kaa nirdesh diya
 Under this, the doctors have to explain the reason for direct referral of patients from primary health center (PHC), community health center (CHC) and district hospital in Gorakhpur Medical College in rural areas
 isse dimagi bukhaar ke marijon ke ilaaj se bachane ke liye unhen sidhe gorakhpur bhejne kii pravriti par roak lagi
 In the words of Siddharth Nath Singh, "due to the Patient Audit, PHC and CHC also started treating patients with encephalitis
 sirf behad gambhir marij hi gorakhpur medical college bheje jane lage
 Opening of encephalitis treatment centers and mini-pediatric care units in rural areas provided treatment to patients before their condition worsened
 yah game changer sabit hua
 The medical college that has become a model, is now wreaking havoc on Purvanchal, who has been suffering from some form of Japanese encephalitis (JE)
 agast, 2017 main jab eies kaa visphot hua to purvanchal main dimagi bukhaar ke ilaaj ke nodel centre gorakhpur medical college kii swasthya sevaaon ne bhi dam tod diya tha
 After this campaign, the facilities of the college were repaired
 piisiu or nionetaal intensive care unit main ventilator se las bistaron kii sankhya 58 se badhaakar 71 kar di gai
 Naveen Kumar, resident doctor posted at PICU, says, "patients with encephalitis are being treated at three levels
 gambhir marij piisiu main bhartee hote hai
 They are referred to the 'high Density Care Unit' (HDU) when reformed
 kaaphi sudhaar hone par inhen saamaanya pediatric ward main rakhkar nigaraanee kii jaati he or puri tarah swasth hone par discharge kar diya jaataa he
 "from January till now, more than 300 children suffering from encephalitis admitted in the pediatric department of Gorakhpur Medical College have gone home healthy
 college ke principal dow
 "the Gorakhpur Medical College is getting complete cure for patients with encephalitis," says Ganesh Kumar
 iske liye sarkaar ne 166 prakaar kii dawaaen muhaiyaa karai hai
 Not only this, the college has also arranged for a burial meal with the patient
 ''dimagi bukhaar ke marijon ko sankraman se bachaane ke liye piisiu samet sabhi vaardon main saptaah ke saaton din alag-alag rang kii aatoklav kii hui chaadaren bichaai ja rahi hai

 "two years ago, there were also deaths of children due to lack of oxygen in the pediatric department at the Medical College
 aisi sthiti dobaaraa paidaa na ho, iske bhi vishesh intjaam kiye gaye hai
 In August 2017, a 20,000 kiloliter 'liquid medical oxygen' tank was supplied to the ICU in the pediatric department of the Medical College
 supplai tub main oxigen ko jamane se rokane ke liye ek veporider laga tha
 a 10 kiloliter rescue tank has been installed separately to increase the availability of oxygen
 dow
 "there is also a backup of 400 oxygen cylinders for the Department of Pediatrics," explains Ganesh Kumar
 koi samasya aane par bina kisi bahari supplai ke 15 dinon tak lagaataar vaardon main oxigen di ja sakati he
 The system will be strengthened and doctors are instructed to treat a child who has a high fever with a shock, as a patient with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES)

 Regional Medical Research Center (RMRC) is being constructed in Gorakhpur Medical College campus to find new ways of treating AES patients through research
 gorakhpur-kushinagar maarg par ban rahe akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) main bhi dimagi bukhaar kii jaanch or shodh kii suvidhaayen muhaiyaa hongi
 In the previous SP government, construction of a 500-bed children's hospital was started next to the Gorakhpur Medical College
 vah banakar taiyaar he jise college ko hi saunp diya gaya he
 Once this new hospital starts, 1,000 bed treatment will be available for the children in the college
 aisi suvidha rakhane vaala gorakhpur medical kalege desh kaa pehla aspataal hoga
 To increase the scope of treatment for meningitis, a total of six new pediatric care units are set to be opened in Azamgarh, Gonda, Mau, Rae Bareli, Hardoi and Sitapur this year
 har unit main ventilator yukt paanch-paanch bistaron kii vyavastha hogi
 Mental fever, which has become a curse for Purvanchal, has given a lifetime disability to 20,000 children so far

 The psychiatric center in the college campus for rehabilitation of such patients is also just a formality
 maansik rup se viklang ho chuke bacchon ke liye yahaan ek bhi neurologist nahin he
 However, Composite Rehabilitation Center (CRC) is under construction in the college campus for patients who have been disabled due to encephalitis
 dimagi bukhaar par sarkari vyavastha bhale hi abhi baari padati dikh rahi he, par isaki asal pariksha agle teen maheenon main hogi

 The latest case is related to Pakistani PM Imran Khan who reached China for the first time
 darasal china pahunche imran beijing main bhaashan de rahe the
 PTV showed its prime minister's speech live
 chook yaheen hui
 Begging was written on the screen instead of Beijing during the live broadcast
 yah chook 20 second tak screen par rahi
 Pakistan is making a lot of fun on this mistake
 Someone on the news team accidentally mistyped ik’s location as “begging” instead of “beijing” and it’s honestly the most hilariously ironic thing ever

 According to local media, this omission also became especially funny because Khan is traveling to China as part of his effort to rescue Pakistan from the impending economic crisis

 This omission from PTV was widely criticized on social media
 pakistan main twitor par # beging ke saath post kiye gayi iske screenshot trend kar rahe the
 During his visit, the main focus of Khan's talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Qing was to seek loans from China for Pakistan facing economic crisis
 baharhaal china ne kaha ki vah pakistan ko aavashyak sahyog karegaa
 It is reported that China has pledged to give $ 6 billion in aid to Pakistan, although this has not been officially confirmed yet

 Two years of demonetisation were completed on Thursday
 aath november, 2016 shaam ke aath baje modi sarkaar ne ek hajaar or 500 ke note band karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 After this step of the government, people had to face a lot of problems in different parts of the country
 atm ke baahar lambii-lambii kataren najar aa rahi thim
 Every person in the country had a story of their own problems related to demonetisation
 koi har roj ke kharch ke liye cash kii talash main atm-atm bhatak rahaa tha to koi bank se baahar kataron main raat guzaar rahaa tha
 Such an interesting incident
 ek din baad hi thi bahan kii shadirayabareli ke kila bazaar ke rahane vaale yasir ahamed khud hi bank main naukari karte hai, lekin notebandi maar se unhen jujhna padaa tha
 They say the sister's wedding was a day after the demonetisation
 main bank se chuttee lekar ghar aa chukaa tha
 All the notes in the house were thousand and 500 hundred
 aise main jab achaanak notebandi kaa elaan hua to puraa parivaar hamaari taraf badi ummiido se dekhne laga
 In such a situation, when Papa said that how everything will happen now, i had no answer at that time
 ghar kii pehali shaadi thi puure parivaar ke bade armaan the
 In such a situation, the elder brother of the boy called Papa and said that do not be disturbed, do whatever you can
 isi bich, hamaare bank ke saathiyon ne or kai kareebi doston ne 100 rupee ke noton kaa hamen intjaam karaayaa
 Then everything has been done
 laga notebandi par log juthi khabaren failaa rahe
 
 elahabaad ke mul nivasee ramesh shukla philhal noida main rah rahe hai
 Ramesh lived in Bhopal during demonetisation
 modi ke notebandi ke ghoshnaa ke baad bhopal main cash flo kii dikkat nahin thi
 Ramesh Shukla said that due to the problems of demonetisation in different parts of the country on various social sites, he felt that it is all nonsense
 People are deliberately sharing and writing such stories
 lekin notebandi ke ek pakhwaade baad jab ramesh ne naukari badali or unhen bhopal se dilli shift hona padaa tab wo notebandi kii pareshaani se do chaar hue
 Since they thought Noida was similar to Bhopal, they did not bring much cash
 is vajah se unhen pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 He said, there was a lot of cash problem here, due to which work could be done in 100 or 150
 vahaan do gune paise kharch karne pade
 In fact, after demonetisation, digital transactions were not very much in trend at all places
 is vajah se unhen auto kii jagah cab book karnaa padataa tha
 Instead of normal hotels, expensive restaurants and shops had to be resorted to for eating and drinking
 jaahir si baat he in sab main unhen apane bajet se zyada kharch karnaa padataa tha
 Mahendra Kumar, a resident of Bhatkakushinagar, a city for cash, says that there was a wedding on November 23, for which the shopping had started when the government announced demonetisation
 iske baad cash ke liye jis tarah se dikkat hue or dar-dar bhatakana padaa, use bayaan nahin kar saktaa
 The local shopkeepers were asking for all the cash from the payment and marriage hall to the catering
 aise main ek baar laga ki shaadi ko kuch dinon ke liye taal diya jaae, lekin rishtedaaron ko nyotaa diya ja chukaa tha
 Due to this, getting married on the same date became a compulsion
 iske liye hamen doston se paise ikaithe karne ke liye shahar-shahar janaa padaa
 Due to demonetization, a lot of marriage could not be arranged, just the ceremony was paid
 ghar banavaane kaa kaam bich main rokna padaabihar ke chhapra ke rahane vaale shivadeep singh philhal dilli main rah rahe hai
 He says that he had gone to the village to celebrate the festival of Deepawali, and only took a few cash
 isi bich pita ji ne ghar banavaane kaa kaam shuru kara diya tha
 Suddenly the government announced demonetisation, due to which there was a lot of cash problem
 atm main paise the nahin or shahar main dukandaaron ke paas card sweep mashine thi nahin
 In such a situation, the work of building a house had to be stopped midway
 dilli lautne ke liye paise kaa kisi tarah se intjaam kiya
 The one whom you call is expressing sorrow, Shaherif Fazil, who lives in Mawana town of Thamerath, has no bank account
 notebandi ke dauraan unke paas hajaar or 500 kii note takreeban 5 lakh rupee ghar main tha
 They tell that through relatives and friends, they somehow get the money deposited in their account
 haalanki baad main un paison ko waapas paane ke liye kaaphi dikkatein uthaani padi
 Despite the money, it seemed that without money
 jis bhi dost ko phone kiya wo apana dukh bayaan karata aise main teen maheene bahut pareshaaniyon main gujarey hai

 " bijepi kii 22 november kii sansadeey dal kii baithak main bhavuk bol kebaad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab vakt aane par jawaab dene kii hunkaar bhari to party ke saansad sawaal uthaane kii himakat nahin kar paae
 But the growing apprehensions in the mind of the BJP and the government became evident
 modi sarkaar ab is mudde par rajnatik nuksaan ke dar se kuch bolne ke bajaae disambar kii miyaad khatm hone kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 But even after almost a fortnight, the party is extremely worried about the way the country is in despair
 sutron ke mutabik, rajya ke prabhariyon ke jariye mangai gai anaupchaarik report ne bijepi kii ulajhanein badha di hai
 The report received by the party leadership has expressed satisfaction that people are with the decision of demonetisation of the Modi government, but anger is growing over the poor preparation to deal with the situation
 in reporton ke baad hi bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne vitt mantri arun jetali ke saath 21 november ko sansad bhawan sthit dakratar main mantranaa kii, jisamen vitt sachiv shaktikant das bhi maujuud the
 In this, there was a particular discussion on the resentment of not getting cash in the villages, inconvenience to the farmers, and the difficulties due to strict guidelines on the amount to be withdrawn for the wedding
 notebandi ke baad se upi ke prabharee omprakash maathur kii pradhanmantri se sidhe do daur kii mulaakaat ho chuki he
 The BJPBJP leaders, apprehensive of the problems, have also started confessing that the decision to demonetize may be right but there was no complete plan to implement it
 arthshaastriyon ne 86 fisadi karency ko badalane ke liye ucch mulya (2,000 ru
 ) Made a plan to unload the note, which was right from the economics point of view, but in practicality, the problem was not assessed by unloading that note
 itane bade note se kharid-bikri aasaan nahin he, aise main 500 ru
 If the notes were first removed, then perhaps the problem would not have been so
 bijepi ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''aane vaale 3-4 maheenon main dihadi majdoor, chote dukandaar, chote kaarobaariyon par zyada asar padegaa or niraashaa ke maahaul kii vajah se kharid-bikri buree tarah se prabhavit hogi
 "but another leader argues," The effect of this move will be seen after one quarter, but it is certain that there will be a negative impact for at least two quarters and this is the period when BJP will be in up's election summer
 "bijepi ko lagata he ki aane vaale samay main iskar vibhaag ne sakhti dikhaai or notice jari hone lage to mushkilen badhengi
 He says that till now the Income Tax Department used to deal only with the rich class, but for the first time it would have to deal with the Nikwon middle class and those with Jan Dhan accounts
 sarkaar kii ore se dhai lakh ru
 They even consider the limit to be a hasty decision
 unke mutabik, agar kisi real estate agent yaa anya ne kisi garib ke khate main do-dhai lakh ru
 If deposited, then how will the Income Tax Department deal with that account holder
 desh main jahaan bade paimaane par aise log hai jo bijli-pani kaa bill tak nahin dete, aise main iskar vibhaag unase kaise recovery karegaa
 He says that resentment can increase in the situation of coercion, in which case it would be appropriate for the government to remain calm on this
 haalanki ve yah bhi ashanka jataate hai ki bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke khilaaf ladaai main nichle str kii beuroperesi main bhrashtachar kii aparimit sambhaavnaaen ban sakati hai
 Not only this, the BJP is also afraid that some tribes in Nagaland are exempted from income tax, so black money can be deposited there and Naga militants can get a boost
 22 november ko hi nagaland main 3
 5 crores Rs
 ke saath bihar ke ek vyapaaree ko dimapur airport par pakadaa janaa or phir note gaayab hona is ashanka ko pusht karata he
 The BJP also fears about the problem of salaried people withdrawing funds in early December, so the party wants the cash flow to increase rapidly
 ek netaa bataate hai ki 1978 main jab vimudrikaran hua tha to yah 2 fisadi tha, lekin aaj 86 fisadi mudra ko dobaaraa system main laana gambhir chunauti he kyonki rigerv bank kii maujuuda kshamta ke lihaaj se isamen kam se kam ek se teen saal kaa samay lag saktaa he
 The question arising at home, since demonetisation has been decided directly from the level of Prime Minister Modi and the top ministers were not kept in the loop, so no one can dare to question it directly
 bijepi-sangh se jude ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''bhartiya arthvyavastha ko america kii tarah nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 When a bank went bankrupt in the US in 2008, the entire economy was seen to crumble, but in India it does not affect the entire economy because the basis of our economy is savings
 isliye mughal se lekar kitne videshi aakrantha aae, lekin bharat ke logon kii sehat par koi khaas asar nahin padaa kyonki hamaara aadhaar bachat he
 But in today's definition, the cash of 15,000 in the house has also come under the category of black money
 " unka maananaa he ki agar ek saal baad arthvyavastha neeche kii ore khiski to mushkil badhegi or dirghakaal main bhi sarkaar ko rajnatik nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Some party leaders are also raising questions that if India wants to move towards e-country or cashless transactions, is its system strong for it? In a meeting after demonetisation, the question arose that Nanya was able to bear the burden of internet, broadband speed and its associated infrastructure e-transaction as only 3 per cent people use it now
 party main log yah bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki notebandi kii adhuri taiyaari kii vajah se niraashaa main kai sawaal uth sakate hai kyonki reliance-jeeyo kii lonching main bhi sarkaar par ungali uthi thi or ab jis tarah se notebandi ke baad petm kii ore se modi ke photo ke saath vigyaapan chaape ja rahe hai usase bhi sawaal uth rahe hai
 Says a BJP leader, "the Chinese company Ali Baba holds 40 percent of the share in Paytm, so 40 percent of the profit is going out of the country
 " unka maananaa he ki virdohi jab is tarah kii daleelon ko hawa denge tab kya jawaab diya jayega
 This leader says that the government should have made complete preparations and created an indigenous company
 sarkari rupai card ko kabhi pramot nahin kiya gaya
 It is worth noting that from the first day of demonetisation, Paytm had stepped up its advertisement and publicity, while the government tried to promote the Rupai card as an advertisement on the 15th day of demonetisation
 haalanki ek sawaal yah bhi uth rahaa he ki jab zyaadaatar tranjaction electronic hone lagenge to swaabhaavik taur par sibar krime badhegaa, aise main bhartiya sibar suraksha tantra kitna majboot he? party kaa ek khemaa arthkranti ke anil bokil kii ore se loksabhaa chunaav ke samay die gaye prajentation ko nakaare jane ke baad achaanak sweekaar karne par bhi sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 a senior minister said that a detailed presentation took place at the residence of Nitin Gadkari, in which even the senior-most leaders related to finance described it as useless for the Indian economy
 sangh ke liye bhi mushkil kii ghadinotbandi ke faisle par sangh kii ore se abhi tak koi peeth thapthapaane vaala saamne nahin aana bhi bijepi main charchaa kaa vishay he
 But some Sangh traditions seem to be broken by the demonetization issue
 sangh kii gurudakshina gupt hoti he or lagbhag nakad main
 Who donated so much, others are not aware of it
 iske peeche sangh kii avadharana samtamulak samaaj bananaa he
 But now the check will damage this concept on Gurudakshina
 sangh-bijepi se jude ek netaa bataate hai, ''janata ke sahyog se chalane vaala aresas mukhya rup se vyapaariyon ke chande se apni gatividhi chalaata he
 But now if the traders have been hit on the money, if the people who donate the money will pull back, then the corporate who donated the cash to the union will now be afraid to give the check because it will be afraid that some other government will be upset with the stamp of being pro-union
 Can do
 " aise main yah ashanka bhi jataai ja rahi he ki aane vaale samay main sangh kii aarthik nirbharta bijepi kii ore bad sakati he
 Not only this, the union which always denies any kind of official membership, will now have to pay its campaigners by check instead of cash in giving expense sheets (salaries)
 aise main sangh kii sadsyta sabit ho jaaegi
 Therefore, how much support the Sangh has for the BJP on demonetisation, will also become clear in the coming times
 upi, punjab main kitna phayda?modi sarkaar ke is daanv ko bhale chunavi rajya upi, punjab main vipakshi dalon kii qamar todgaye vaala kadam mana ja rahaa ho, lekin sangh se jude ek netaa kehete hai, ''is daleel main koi dam nahin he kyonki punjab main kaaphi enarai log hai or unke jariye fund liya ja saktaa he
 "he also claims that" BSP in UP does not give money to candidates, but takes it
 " haalanki bijepi ke netaa is khabar se bhi ashankit hai ki aane vaale samay main modi sarkaar sona, loker par sakhti kar sakati he
 In the words of a senior leader, "if this happens, it can remind us of days like Emergency
" " party ke kuch netaaon kii daleel he ki aane vaale 6 maheene main 50 fisadi karency waapas bazaar main aati he to ashanka se bhaybheet log aadha rokkar rakhenge
 Due to this, the possibility of strengthening of the market is less at present
 aise main sarvaadhik maar madhyam varg par padane kii ashanka jataai ja rahi he jo multah bijepi ke kor voter maane jate hai
 "modi is currently V
," says a BJP leader
 pi
 Singh is on the road
 lekin unke samay main mandal kamishan aayaa to saamaajik -rajnatik sameekaran badal gaye or uskaa sarvaadhik khamiyaja ve
 P
 singh ko hi bhugatna padaa kyonki logon ne apni jatiyon ke netaaon ko vot diya or ve
 P
 singh satta main nahin laut paae
 "according to him, in the elections of states like up-bihar, people finally vote in the name of caste
 agar aane vaale samay main 14 lakh karod ru
 3-4 lakh crore out of Rs
 bhi bank main waapas nahin aate hai to modi use naitik jeet ke taur par pesh kar sakate hai
 After that, the Prime Minister and the BJP leadership can take some relief measures to compensate for the problem of demonetisation in the coming time
 par philhal itnaa saaf he ki modi ne bada khatra uthaaya he jisase unke apane bhi pareshaan hai or virdohi bhi
 In such a situation, if Modi is successful, he will become history man, otherwise he will have to face the biggest mess of history

 ) When Chhagan Bhujbal became the tallest leader of Maharashtra while selling vegetables on the streets of Mumbai, this is probably no less than a 'success story'
 mumbai ke maajagaanv main shivasena ke shakha pramukh se lekar maharashtra ke upmukhyamantri tak kaa safar, raajnneeti main yashasvi hone kii koshish karne vaale kisi bhi raajnneetik kaaryakarta ke liye seekhney laayak he
 Hardly anyone in Maharashtra would have had experience working closely with both Maharashtra's two big leaders Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and Maratha Strongman Sharad Pawar
 apni baat manwaane ke liye jarurat padane par in donon netaaon ko apana bal dikhaane se bhujabal kabhi nahin chuke
 He left the Shiv Sena when the party's hegemony was at its peak and he was trembling in the name of Bal Thackeray, similarly he chose the path of the NCP when it was believed that if he stayed in the Congress, he might have become the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 They would get a chance
 apni sharton par kii raajnneetibhujabal ne raajnneeti apni sharton par kii
 The fearlessness required of him was in them, but sometimes this fearlessness makes the leader inattentive and the leader's downfall begins
 chagan bhujabalka udhaaharan is ke liye diya jayega
 At this time, he will be the first such big leader of Maharashtra's politics, who has had to go after bars on charges of corruption
 unke najdiki kehete hai ye naubat unki beparwahee le ai he
 Bhujbal family stuck in scandals When in 2003–04, when Vibhunsabal was at the peak of his career, he was the Chief Minister of NCP in Maharashtra while being Deputy Chief Minister
 party main sharad pavaar ke baad unki baat maani jaati, pavaar ke sipahasalar ke rup main congress bhi unase batch kar rahati or vilasarav deshmukh ke hote hue bhi wo maharashtra kii congress-ensipi sarkaar kaa cheharaa bane hue the
 Just a year ago, the attempt to topple the Shiv Sena government was unsuccessful under Bhujbal's leadership and everything was going well
 aise main telgi scam aayaa
 Bhujbal family also came under the grip of scam
 bhattije samir, jise pravartan nideshaalay pehle hi giraftaar kar chuki he, sarkaar dwaara gathit esaiti unase poochtacha kar chuki thi
 The party took the edge
 Now it was Chagan Bhujbal
 apane kariyar ke charam par hote hue bhi esaiti jaanch kii aanch main party na funs jaae, is dar se unhen istipha dena padaa
 The SIT interrogated him but after the matter went to the CBI, Chhagan Bhujbal and his nephew Samirodo narrowly survived
 kaha jaataa he ki bhujabal ko tab laga kii mushkil vakt main party unke saath khadi nahin he lekin unke netaa sharad pavaar ne unhen saaf kah diya ki aise maamalon me fanse to uskaa saamana akele hi karnaa padataa he, party ek had ke baad kinaaraa hi kar leti he
 Bhujbal learned a lesson from this matter of caste politics
 abtak khulkar raajnneeti karne vaale bhujabal ab jaati kii raajnneeti kar apni jameen dhughane lage
 He felt that if he wanted to remain vaccinated in politics, then he should have a base of his supporters and that would be done only when he would do Obasi politics
 wo telgi scam giraftaar se to bache lekin raajnneeti ne haashiye par jane ke baad usase baahar nikalne ke liye unhen maratha party main obisi netaa banane kaa rasta hi dikhaai diya
 The amazing thing is that Bhujbal, who opposed the Mandal Commission while living in Shiv Sena, became the biggest supporter of OBC reservation
 ban gai bhrashtachari kii chhavipahale bhi unhone ye rasta chunaa tha, jab 1991 main shivasena main bal thakare ne unke bajaae manohar joshi ko chunaa, jisase naaraaz bhujabal ne apana obisi card nikaala tha
 However, at that time, Sharad Pawar immediately gave him a place in the Congress, but this time there was no way left in front of him instead of doing politics openly
 to telgi scam main wo batch to nikle, lekin unki raajnneeti kii disha badal gai
 However this scam also changed his image
 maharashtra main bhrashtachar kaa wo cheharaa ban chuke the
 Bhujbal's supporters were hopeful that he would do something to change his image but he dashed the hopes
 aaropon ko lekar beparwaah rahe bhujabaldobaaraa satta main lautne ke baad unase grih mantralay to chhin gaya lekin badale main peedblyoody yani lokanirmaan mantralay mila
 Discussion of wrongful transfers and contracts in the ministry also started immediately
 jab maharashtra sadan maamle main bhujabal ke najdiki contractor chamanakar ko contract dene ko lekar pehali baar virdohi shivasena ne aarope lagaaya, to phir aam aadmi party or baad main mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan tak ne gadabadi kii baat kahi, lekin bhujabal ise cabinet kaa nirnay bataakar dante rahe
 Sources in the NCP say that Bhujbal had gone unconscious after exiting the Telgi case
 maharashtra sadan ghotaale main ghire bhujabaliske baad aaropon kii jhadi lag gai
 Chhagan Bhujbal has been accused by the state anti-corruption Bureau of misappropriation of crores in the Maharashtra Sadan scam
 is maamle main bhujabal ke bete pankaj or bhattije samir ke saath 14 log aaropee hai
 The new Maharashtra Sadan was constructed at a cost of Rs 100 crore and was then ruled by the congress-ncp alliance in Maharashtra
 aarope laga ki construction ke theke dene main gadabadiyaan hui thi
 Companies were given arbitrary contracts
 saath hi is ghotaale se mili dhan ko safed karne ke liye samir bhujabal or pankaj ne takreeban 62 farji companiyaan banaain, bank acount khole
 Shown coal mines and thermal power plants abroad
 ghotaalon par ghotaale, funsate gaye chaganmamla yaha nahin rukaa, iske alaava chagan bhujabal ke khilaaf mumbai ke kaaleen vishvavidhyalay land scam, mumbai-nasik toll road sahit alag-alag 9 projects main apane karibiyon ko theke dekar kareeb 890 rupee ke ghotaale kaa bhi aarope he
 On the basis of all these allegations, the Enforcement Directorate had registered two firs in June 2015 against 17 people including Chhagan Bhujbal, his son Pankaj and nephew Sameer under the Money Laundering Act and FEMA, and after Sameer Bhujbal, now Chhagan Bhujbal himself was arrested 
 farji companiyon kaa jaal todane kii koshishaidi yani pravartan nideshaalay ke sutron kaa kahana he ki jaanch main nikal kar saamne aayaa he ki kolkata kii kai farji companeeyon ne samir or pankaj bhujabal kii companio main premium donon main share kharide or ye paisa navi mumbai main hex world naam kaa houseing project banane main lagaaya gaya
 Usually, such a fake company is made to hide black money, but the ED claims that they will be able to break this trap
 bhujabal pehle hi daawa kar rahe hai ki is baar wo in aaropon se saaf hokar baahar niklenge lekin shaayad wo ye bhul rahe hai ki telgi scam se baahar nikalne ke baad unhen khoyaa hua upmukhyamantri pad to mil gaya lekin unki raajnneeti or party par pakad kamjor ho gai thi
 Now the remaining grip of this case has also been pushed
 obisi daanv to pehle hi khel chuke hai or 69 saal kii umr main nayaa daanv khilne kii takat kam hi rah gai he
 Muharram is the first month of the Islamic calendar
 is maheene kii 10veen taarikh ko islam ke anunaayi ranj or gam ke taur par manaate hai
 This is because about 1337 years ago, on the same date of Muharram, Hazrat Hussain, the Nawase of Prophet Mohammad, was slaughtered
 iraq kii rajdhani baghdad se kareeb 120 kilometre dur karbala naam kii ek jagah he
 According to Islamic scholars, this is not just the name of a city, but the soil here is witness to the biggest battle of Islamic date, in which the persecution of the oppressed
 yahaan kii hawaaen chashmadid hai yajid ke un pathar dil farmaanon kii, jab 6 maheene ke ali asagar ko pani tak nahin pine diya gaya or us atyaachaar kii, jahaan bhukh-pyaas se ek maa ke seene kaa doodh khushk ho gaya
 632 AD main paigambar mohammad kaa nidhan ho jane ke baad unke parivaar or islam ke dushman majboot hone lage
 The first enemies attacked Fatima Zahra, Mohammed's daughter
 phir unke damaad hazrat ali par talwaar se waar kar unhen katl kar diya gaya
 This was followed by the martyrdom of Ali's elder son Hasan
 parivaar ko khatm karnaa tha makasadaislamic scolers ke mutabik, dushman paigambar mohammad ke puure parivaar ko khatm karnaa chaahate the
 After the martyrdom of Ali and his elder son Hasan, the enemies now started targeting the younger son Hussein
 yajid or husseinpangbar ke parivaar ko khatm karne kii sajeesh makka-madina se nikalakar karbala tak pahunch gai
 Yazid (who believed himself to be the Caliph) pressurized Hussein to follow his course
 hossain ko hukum kiya ki wo use apana khalipha maane
 He wanted that if Hussein began to accept him, he would be dominated by Islam, which he would be able to run according to himself
 magar, hossain ne aisa maanane se inkaar kar diya
 Hussain turned down every offer of Yajid
 jab hossain karbala pahunche the, unke saath ek chota sa lashkar tha
 Apart from women, there were small children in this convoy
 islamic calendar ke mutabik muharram kii duusari taarikh ko hossain karbala pahunche the
 After this, on 7 Muharram, Yajid stopped Hussain's Lashkar water and made every possible pressure on him to obey him
 hossain ko pataa tha ki yajid bahut taqatvar he
 His Lashkar is much bigger
 unke paas hathiyaar hai, khanjar hai, talavaarein hai
 While his own people are in very small numbers
 baavjood iske hossain apane usee deen par kaayam rahe, jo unke naanaa or paigambar mohammad kaa islam he
 Meanwhile Yajid's atrocities continued to grow
 magar, wo hossain or unke kafile ke hausalo ko diga na sake
 On the 9th of Muharram, Imam Hussain offered to save his life by leaving the convoy from his companions

 Who ever made movies

 ye log badi saavdhaanee se apana kaam kar rahe the
 In order to escape from the police, these people had kept the Diggi of a car in the warehouse room in front of the factory closed in Okhla Industrial Area
 jisase kisi ko shaq na ho
 According to the police, these people used to keep liquor from Haryana and kept it in the car carts parked in front of the closed factories instead of keeping it at home

 Subramanian Swamy also argued in court that Pushkar died in January 2014, while Dillipulis registered an FIR in the case in 2015
 vahiin maut ke baad dilli police dwaara kisi prakaar kii vijalence jaach nahi kii gai
 Nor did he form any committee and the day Pushkar died, the CCTV on his hotel floor was bad

 For the time being, it will be very important to see what all the agencies stand for in the investigation report related to Pushkar's death

 There is no politics in it but it is not good on humanitarian grounds

 '' itawa ke numaaish maidan main bane oonche manch se baba ramdev ne is hunkaar ke saath apni baat shuru kii
 Although Baba was teaching here Pranayam and nation building tricks, but this roar proved that Baba, who became Ranchod in Ramlila Maidan, has come to fight the battle of overthrowing Congress by becoming a maharathi
 manch sambhalate hi baba ne janata se poocha, ''aapako kamjor pradhanmantri chahie yaa majboot pradhanmantri?'' jawaab aayaa 'majboot'
 This voice of flamboyant here not only showed that the number of people who heard Baba's call had not diminished, but also comforted Baba that his charisma on the hearts of the people was not yet repulsed
 26 oktober 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india todesitambar main jhansi se shuru hui baba kii yatra ko samaajawaadee party ke dhwast garh itawa tak pahunchane main kareeb ek maheene kaa vakt laga
 But the manner of movement in the Ramlila Maidan in Delhi in June and the pattern of the current journey has seen an epoch-making change
 bharat swabhimaan yatra ke us charan main baba samarthakon ne puure desh ko jhanda, binar or hording se paat diya tha
 Baba was constantly on TV
 baba kaa laav lashkar bahut bada tha or prachaar puri tarah hytech jabaki is baar itawa main chuninda jagahon par hi yatra kii prachaar saamagree najar ai
 Baba himself stayed in the rest house of a college and his journey is on Tata Safari instead of chartered planes
 agar koi cheez ek samaan he, to vah he, janata main unki apil
 "despite my duty till 12 o'clock last night, i reached Baba's Pranayam camp at five in the morning
 main niyamit taur se yoga karata hum or jab baba khud shahar main aae to mujhe pahunchnaa hi tha
 In the afternoon at the District Panchayat Auditorium in Etawah, the constable Ram Kumar Singh, a soldier on duty, said this
 india today kii or khabaron ko padhane ke liye clic karenyog shivi main bhi dikhaa kii mahila police kii kari jawan duty ke saath yoga bhi kar rahi thim
 Perhaps Baba himself did not even know that his visit would get such support
 isiilie pehle itawa main sirf subah hi yoga shivi kaa kaarykram tha
 Later Baba also added an evening session
 bharat swabhimaan yatra se jude sthaneey kaaryakarta hari shankar patel ne kaha, ''logon ko kaale dhan vaali baba kii baat samaj aa rahi he
 People are with them
 itawa main to kai hotel maalikon ne yatra main baahar se aae kaaryakartaaon ke liye hotel ke kamare muft yaa bilkul kam daam main muhaiyaa karaae hai
 Many people have arranged food for the workers on their behalf
 chanda dene waalon kii bhi kami nahin rahi
 "it is interesting that Team Anna was also going to come here on October 12 and leaflets were also printed in this regard, but Team Anna jumped in Hisar election and the tour here was canceled
" itawa main bahut se aise log mili jo baba or anna donon ke andolan ke kaaryakarta banane ko taiyaar hai
 If sources are to be believed, the two sides also took the initiative to build an office in the house of the same person
 donon hi pakshon ko gaiyr-congressi dalon kaa bhi ab tak thik-thaak sahyog mila
 Despite having a common support, both sides want their credit
 pichhali baar andolan ke aayojan main paise ke istemaal main paardarshita ke sawaal se ghire baba ne is baar badi sidhi ranneeti apanaai he
 5,000
 se adhik kaa chanda dene vaale sabhi daandaataaon ke naam mote-mote aksharon main manch par likhva die or shaam ko apane manch par aashirwad dene ke bahaane daandaataaon kii parade kara di
 Perhaps attracted by this open strategy, Samajwadi Party leaders left no stone unturned to show close proximity to Baba in Etawah and were at the forefront of giving donations
 bhaajapa ke bhi kuch sthaneey netaa baba ke najadik dikhaai die
 But no one from the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress came here
 basapa ke sawaal par baba ne kaha, ''nahin, aisi baat nahin basapa ke log bhi kai jagahon par hamaare kaaryakramon main aae hai
 Apart from Congress, all parties want our support
 '' pichley vidhansabha chunaav main mulaayam singh yadav ke garh itawa main hi basapa ke haathon buree paraajay jhel chuki sapa ko baba ke karishme se kitni ummid he, ise isi baat se samaj sakate hai ki party ke sansadeey dal ke netaa ramgopal yadav ne guest house pahunchakar baba se band kamare main kaaphi der tak mantranaa kii
 Earlier, Akhilesh Yadav has also had a separate discussion with Baba
 kaarykram main shaamil hone aae niraj yadav ne yahaan aane kii vajah poochne par kaha, ''ab tak tivi par dekhte the, ab jab saakshaat shahar main aae hai to aisa mauka koun ganvaaega
 '' And chance Ramdev also does not want to lose
 isiilie is baar unke manch se bhi sureele or joshilay geet sunari de rahe hai
 One of the reasons why people lost their movement in Anna's movement was the wonderful songs and music there
 baba ke manch se raajnneetik arthon se bharaa geet baja, ''hamako pataa naa tha suraj bachakaani bhashaa bolegaa
 "and in the same song, there is a line in the middle," i have seen the Constitution polishing the house of the leader
 'khaas baat yah he ki baba yoga shivi main aisi baat karte hai jaise chunavi raajnneeti ko prabhavit karnaa unke vyapak raashtra nirmaan ke agenda kaa chota-sa hissaa ho, lekin jab press ko sambodhit karte hai to sidhe rajnatik sandesh dene main gurej nahin karte
 On the question of the achievement of the yatra, Baba said, "we have clearly told the public to vote for those who support Baba's issues
" congress andolan ke khilaaf he, isliye congress kaa virodh karo
 "but the question is whether Ramdev's movement is going to affect the heart of the people, or will it also be on his finger in the elections
" The judgement will have a far reaching effect because # Aadhaar is relevant for a large no
 of subsidies
 It is also relevant to plug loot & waste that has happened
 i hope the judgment is in favor of # Aadhaar: Mukul Rohatgi, as AG he represented the government in Aadhaar case pic

 com / eb7ai0bnaq pradhanmantri narendra modi apane do divasiy upi daure ke pehle din shanivaar ko azamgarh ke baad varanasi pahunche
 PM Modi inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of various projects for his parliamentary constituency
 piem modi ne yahaan kareeb 1000 karod kii yojanaon kaa shilanyas kiya
 What Modi said on the development of Kashi? PM Modi said that the works being done in Varanasi today are being done under a permanent system, which will turn Banaras into a smart city
 unhone kaha ki jo kaam kiye ja rahe hai, uske saath ye bhi sunishchit kiya ja rahaa he ki wo kam se kam 15 saal tak chalem
 Further, PM Modi said that it takes more time and labor to do such work, but a permanent system is being established
 jiskaa parinaam aane vaale dinon main kashivasiyon ko dikhne lagegaa
 He said that the Integrated Command and Control Center is under rapid progress here
 puure shahar ke prashasan kaa, public suvidhaon kaa niyantran yaheen se hone vaala he
 Apart from this, the PM said, 'A new Benaras is being constructed for New India, whose soul will be archaic but the body will be the latest
 jisamen aadhyatm bhi hoga or aadhuniktaa bhi hogi
 Where there will be culture and culture in every particle, but arrangements will be smart
 ' unhone kaha ki pehle rajya main duusari party kii sarkaar thi, jiske chalate yahaan kaa vikaas kaary baadhit ho rahaa tha
 Ever since the BJP government came to power in UP, the pace of development of Kashi has accelerated
 '4 saal pehle samay na bhoolen'piem modi ne apni sarkaar main varanasi ke liye kiye gaye vikaas kaaryon kaa bakhaan karte hue ye bhi kaha ki hamen chaar varsh pehle kaa wo samay bhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie, jab varanasi kii vyavasthaaen sankat main thim
 Garbage-dirt everywhere, bad roads, sewer overflowing, wires hanging from the pillars, jam, the whole city was disturbed
 notebandi kaa shikaar hui 500 rupee kii note ko chalaane kaa aakhri din 15 disambar madhyaraatri he
 After this note cannot be played anywhere
 kendra sarkaar ne saaf kar diya he ki vah is note ko jaruri kaamon ke liye bhi ab maanya nahin kar sakati
 So, in the next few hours you have not been able to spend 500 rupee notes with you, now you have no option but to deposit it in the bank by 31 December
 buudhvaar ko vitt mantralay main aarthik maamalon ke sachiv shaktikanta das ne twit karte hue jaankaree di he ki ab sarkaar is note ko chalaane kii miyaad main koi ijapha nahin karne ja rahi he
 Shaktikanta Das has denied the information given through some media that the government can increase this period
 Exemptions for use of old Rs
 500 notes will end on 15 Dec midnight
 Sections of media reporting wrongly as if it's tonight
 - Shaktikanta Das (@dasshaktikanta) December 14, 2016 This clearly means that this note will no longer be used for medicines, electricity bills, water bills and other essential works in the country from the midnight of 15 December
 gauratlab he ki kendra sarkaar ne petrol pump, toll plaza, railway or hawaii tikat ke liye is karency ke istemaal par pehle hi pabandi laga di thi
 After the demonetisation on November 8, the government had earlier given 72 hours to use the old 500 and 1000 rupee currency
 lekin is miyaad ko lagaataar badhaate hue aakhri baar 15 disambar kii taarikh tay kar di thi
 The bjp's minority front has defended the statement of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, in which he called the people of the country Hindu and Hindutva as the identity of India
 bayaan kaa bachaav ke peeche tark diya gaya he ki bhagwat kii tippanee saamaajik sandarbh main he or isko dharmik nazariye se nahin dekha janaa chahie
 Abdul Rashid Ansari, who again became the President of Minority Morcha in BJP President Amit Shah's team, said in the case, 'whatever he (bhagwat) had to say to me, it was in the social context
 unhone ise dharmik sandarbh main nahin kaha ki duusare majahab ke log bhi hindu hai
 This statement should be viewed from a social perspective
 is par kisi tarah kaa aitraaj nahin hona chahie
 Ansari further said that when we read the song of Iqbal, we proudly say that we are Hindi, we are Hindustan
 kahin hindustaniyon ke liye hindi shabd istemaal kiya jaataa he, irani sahitya main sindhu ko hindu kaha jaataa he
 In that context also, the term Hindu is used in social context and not in religious context
 saamaajik nazariye se hindu shabd ke istemaal main koi dikkat nahin he
 It is worth mentioning that in the past few days Bhavat had said in Cuttack, Odisha, that when the people of America can be called American, German people can be called Germans and England people can be called British, then why people living in India cannot be called Hindus
 iske kuch dinon baad mumbai main bhi vishwa hindu parishad ke kaarykram main bhagwat ne kaha ki hindutv bharat kii pahchaan he or hindutv main yah kshamta he ki vah duusari pahachaanon ko apane main samahit kar sake
 The responsibility of the state government towards the riots: Ansari, the chairman of the Minority Front, dismissed the Congress allegations that incidents of communal violence in the country had increased during the Modi government's tenure
 unhone kaha, 'aisa kuch nahin hua he
 Nothing happened for which the party is said to be responsible
 jahaan bhi ghatnaayen hui hai uske liye vahaan kii sarkaar kii jimmedaari banati he
 Ansari said that the highest number of incidents have happened in UP, there is not the BJP but the Samajwadi Party government
 maharashtra or kuch duusare sthanon par sampradayik tanaav paidaa hua he, vahaan bhi bijepi kii sarkarein nahin hai
 Law and order is a matter of state and BJP cannot be held responsible for these incidents
 congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue ansaari ne kaha, 'congress kii haisiyat ab kuch kehane laayak to rahi nahin
 In such a situation, he is making similar allegations
 unka yahi kaam rah gaya he ki har cheez ke liye bijepi or modi ji ko jimmedaar tehraaya jaae

 After which the police immediately came into action and registered a case against the constable and arrested him on Sunday
 gauratlab he, soobe ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne pichley dinon kaha tha ki unhen viraasat main jangal raaj mila tha, lekin pradesh main jald hi kanoon kaa raaj sthapit hoga
 For the moment, it has to be seen how and how long Yogis are able to rein in the rising crimes in the state
 congress ne udyogpati rahul bajaj ke ‘dar kaa maahaul' sambandhi bayaan ko lekar ravivaar ko kendra kii modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue daawa kiya ki unki bhavanaaen deshbhar kii sajhi bhaavana he
 The party said that how can one expect investors to come without reconciliation
 bajaj ne mumbai main shanivaar ko ek puraskaar samaaroh main kaha tha ki ‘dar kaa maahaul' he or log sarkaar kii aalochana karne se darate hai or logon main yah yakeen nahin he ki unki aalochana ko sarkaar main saraahaa jayega
 'home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and others were present on the occasion
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne arthvyavastha par ek rashtriya sammelan main kaha tha ki kai udyogpatiyon ne unhen bataaya hai ki ve sarkari adhikariyon dwaara utpeedan ke dar main rahete hai
 This statement of Bajaj came a day after Singh's statement

 ' congress ke ek anya pravaktaa abhishek singhvi ne kaha ki kaaphi samay baad ‘corporate jagat se kisi vyakti ne satta ke bare main kuch sach bolne kaa saahas dikhaaya he
 Jairam Ramesh, a senior party leader, said in a tweet, "one of the most well-known taglines in the Indian corporate advertising industry is that 'you can't beat Bajaj
' ' amit shah ko bhi pataa chal gaya he ki aap bas ek bajaj ko chup nahin kara sakate hai

 The NGT reprimanded the Delhi Jal Board, while reprimanding the Water Board, it said that it had said to present information about it within three days on 22 August
 lekin abhi tak report nahin di gai
 The NGT said that the department is repeatedly making such mild statements that it could not complete

 Then that ground water is being done by DMRC, some other industry or company working on the project
 mantralay kaa kahana tha ki paryaavaran adhinium ke section 3 ke tahat central ground water athurity ko yah adhikaar diya gaya he
 The Central Ground Water Authority has the right to control, develop and maintain water resources in the country
 DMRC par ground water kaa durupyog karne kaa aropengiti yachikakarta kush kalra kii us yachika par sunwaayee kar rahi he jismendmarsiper ground water ke beja istemaal kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he

 Vishun Rai College of Vaishali was on the government's radar for many years due to its mafiaagiri
 is college ke pehle ke toppers par bhi sawaal uthe the
 But for the first time in the case of Ruby Rai and Saurabh Shrestha, the college is directly under the government's target
 top karwaane ke is khel ko lekar bada khulaasa ab hua he
 It is said that the college used to change the copy of students after the examination for this
 isamen koi shaq nahin he ki maamle main bihar sarkaar or pariksha samiti kii ghor kirakiri ho rahi he
 In such a situation, the question arises that despite having full security protection, how was the college successful in changing its copy to top the college? Despite being on the government's radar, the college, according to the sources of rigging of the government, copied the entire Vaishali district While a copy of Vishun Rai College was brought to Kaimur, it was brought to the Rajendra Nagar Investigation Center, considered to be the safest in Patna
 beete saal ke isi college ke topper par sawaal uthe the
 That is why the government had made special arrangements for this college this time, but this time too the copies of this college got caught
 sutron ke mutabik toparon kii puri copy hi badal di gai he, is copy par number to ek hai lekin puri copy alag he
 Where the Copies Changed The government system is distressed as to where and how the reshuffle took place despite the government being on the radar
 sutron kii maane to ye pherbadal pariksha centre par hua yaa phir patna ke jaanch centre par
 Incopies were changed very cleanly
 is baar pariksha kadachaar mukt tha
 Last year, pictures of copy of matriculation examination went viral worldwide and the Bihar government was fiercely embarrassed
 to is baar pariksha itani kadai se lee gai ki inter pariksha main 50 fisadi chaatr fail kar gaye
 Thousands of students left the examination midway
 puure pariksha kii video recording kii gai, lekin aakhir kapiyaan kahaan badali gai or kiske ishaare par itnaa bada kaam hua?patna main hi copy badale jane kaa shakajaahir he koi chota-motaa shaks is kaam ko anjaam nahin de saktaa
 In such a situation, there is definitely a hand of some big fish
 sutron ke mutabik kaapiyon main pherbadal kaa kaam patna main hi kiya gaya hoga jahaan kuch khaas logon ko hi jane kii ijaajat thi
 In such a situation, the government is hopeful that its investigation report will reveal which person's gesture got under the nose of the mafigiri government of the topopers
 shiksha mantri ne mana ki system main kuch 'blike ship'rajya ke shikshaamantri ashok choudhary ne 'aaj tak' ke khaas baatcheet main mana ki system main kuch blike ship hai, jinhone puure vyavastha ke saath khilwaad kiya he
 There has also been a huge lapse at the government level
 isane kadachaar mukt pariksha ke tamaam daavon kii bakhiya udhed di he
 In such a situation, all those faces will be revealed soon, with whose connivance it has been done
