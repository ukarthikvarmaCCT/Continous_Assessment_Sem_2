pipuls democratic party (pidipi) ne sashastr bal visheshadhikaar kanoon (eexspie) ko radd karne kii maang kii or kaha ki aisi badali paristhiti jab aatankwaad kaaphi kam ho gaya he to is kanoon kaa jari rahanaa 'shanti prakriya ke liye baadhak' he
 PDP Conservator Mufti Mohammed Saeed said, "in the changed situation when terrorism has reduced to a great extent and people are increasingly participating in the democratic process, then continuation of the law is a hindrance to normalcy and peace process
 unhone kaha, ‘eexspie hataanaa or loktantric sansthaanon kii purna bahaali mudde ke samaadhaan ke liye sabase mahatvapurn kadam he
 ' supreme court ke haal ke faislon ne itihaas rach diya khaskar aam aadmi kii nijee swatantraaa ko lekar
 The decision that came first was the most historical one, stating that homosexuality is not illegal
 supreme court ne kaha ki section 377 ataarkik, manamaana or samaj se pare he or saamaajik naitikta vyakti ke adhikaar main baadha nahin he
 This decision broke a fettle in society that was still confined to the walls or inside the houses
 samalangik log abhi tak samaaj main jillat or tiraskaar kii jindagi jhelte the
 The family was also unwilling to accept that there was a homosexual in their house
 is faisle ne samaaj ke ek tabake ko aawaaj di or unhen samaaj main sammaan se jeene kaa haq diya
 Another important decision was in the matter of giving reservation in promotion to scheduled caste, scheduled tribe community
 paanch jajon kaa faisla tha
 It left everything to the government because Parliament has the power to make laws, only the court can interpret it
 isamen sabase mahatvapurn baat thi ki sarkaar ko kaha gaya ki prashasnic kushalta kaa maamla vahi dekhe or krimi layer kaa maamla sansad par chhod diya
 Then came a big decision of the Aadhaar card, in which any private company was banned from asking for Aadhaar
 bank khaaton se aadhaar jodna jaruri nahin kar diya gaya lekin pan number ke liye aadhaar jaruri rahegaa
 Aadhar will be necessary for welfare schemes but due to this no one can be killed
 rashtriya suraksha ke sawaal par aadhaar maang sakate hai lekin uske liye purv jaj yaa sachiv str ke afasar kii anumati jaruri hogi
 But there was also a disagreement in this decision
 vah justise chandrachud kii taraf se ai jisamen unhone ise niztaa ke adhikaar se kaha or sarkaar dwaara aadhaar bill ko mani bill banane or rajyasabha na jane par bhi tippanee kii
 Then came another important decision on the Ayodhya Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, in which it was not considered necessary to have a mosque to offer Namaz and the 2010 Allahabad High Court decision had no effect
 is faisle ko badi bench ko nahin bheja gaya
 The court said that all religions, temples, mosques, gurudwaras and churches are the same and anyone can be acquired
 magar is faisle main ek asahmati thi jo justise abdul nazeer kii taraf se ai jisamen unhone kaha ki namaaj ke liye masjid ke jaruri na hone par faisla dene se pehle vistrut pareekshan nahin kiya gaya
 He said that the decision of 1994 is under the question of questions, so the matter should be referred to the Constitution Bench
 phir ek or bada faisla aayaa jisamen edltri yani vyabhichaar ko aparaadh nahin mana gaya
 It was a big decision for the people
 magar yah kai lihaaj se mahatvapurn he jisamen kaha gaya ki pati-patni kaa maalik nahin he
 At the same time, the court said that the law is against the right to gender equality, the beauty of the constitution is i, u and me
 
 
 magar ek baat saaf kar duun ki is kanoon kaa matlab yah nahin he ki ab aap kisi bhi mahila se sambandh bana sakate hai or batch jaaen, us mahila kaa pati abhi bhi aap par cese kar saktaa he
 
 sabase taaja faisla he ki kerala ke sabarimala mandir ke daravaaje mahilaon ke liye bhi khol die gaye
 This is a major step for women's rights and equality
 yah samaaj main pitrusattatmak niyam ke khilaaf he, parampara dharm kaa abhinn hissaa nahin ho saktaa or puja se inkaar karnaa mahila kii garima ko inkaar karnaa mana jayega
 The comments to ye sab kuch aise faisle rahe jo samaaj sudhaar kii tarah se dekhe ja sakate hai
 There were some laws which belonged to the British era i
e
 the Victorian period which should have been changed
 in faislon ne yah tay kar diya he ki samaaj main jab bhi samanta, suraksha, swatantraaa kii baat hogi supreme court sabase aage rahegaa yahi vajah he ki gaanv-gaanv main log kehete hai ki are supreme court tak ladenge kyonki supreme court hi he 'supreme

 phir ek bada faisla aayaa aadhaar card kaa jisamen kisi bhi nijee company ko aadhaar maangane par roak laga di gai
 Linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts has not been made necessary but Aadhaar will be necessary for PAN numbers
 kalyankari yojanaon ke liye aadhaar jaruri rahegaa magar uske chalate kisi kaa haq nahin maaraa ja saktaa he
 One can ask for Aadhaar on the question of national security but for that the permission of former judge or secretary level officer will be required
 lekin is faisle main ek asahmati bhi thi
 She came on behalf of Justice Chandrachud in which she called it with the right of privacy and also commented on the government making Aadhaar bill a money bill and not going to Rajya Sabha
 phir ek or mahatvapurn faisla aayaa ayodhya ram janmabhumi vivaad par, jisamen namaaj padhane ke liye masjid kaa hona jaruri nahin mana gaya or 2010 ke elahabaad hai court ke faisle par koi asar nahin padaa
 This decision was not sent to the larger bench
 adaalat ne kaha ki sabhi dharm, mandir, masjid, gurudwara or carch ek samaan hai or kisi kaa bhi adhigrahan kiya ja saktaa he
 But there was a disagreement in the decision that came from Justice Abdul Nazir, in which he said that a detailed trial was not conducted before the verdict was not necessary for the Namaz
 unhone kaha ki 1994 kaa faisla sawaalon ke ghere main he lihaaja maamla samvidhan peeth ko bheja jaae
 Then another big decision came in which adultery means fornication is not considered a crime
 logon ke liye yah bada atapata faisla tha
 But it is important in many respects, saying that husband and wife do not own
 saath hi adaalat ne kaha ki kanoon langik samanta ke adhikaar ke khilaaf he samvidhan kii khubsuurati he ai,you or me
 
 
 But let me make one thing clear that this law does not mean that now you can have a relationship with any woman and be saved, that woman's husband can still file a case against you
 
 The latest decision is that the doors of the Sabarimala temple in Kerala were also opened for women
 yah mahila adhikaar or samanta ke liye ek bahut bada kadam he
 It is against the patriarchal rule in society, tradition cannot be an integral part of religion and denial of worship would be considered to deny the dignity of the woman
 tippaniyan So all these are such decisions which can be seen in the form of social reform
 isamen kuch aise kanoon the jo angrejon ke jamaane ke the yani victorian kaal ke jinhen badla hi janaa chahie tha
 These decisions have decided that whenever there is talk of equality, security and freedom in the society, the Supreme Court will be at the forefront, that is why people in every village say that they will fight till the Supreme Court because the Supreme Court is the 'supreme

 In Rajasthan's capital Jaipur, a woman was raped in the name of Halala
 ab wo mahila insaaf ke liye dar-dar bhatak rahi he
 But no one is going to listen to him, from the police to the contractors of religion
 mahila ne pradhanmantri modi se madad kii guhaar lagaai he
 40-year-old Laika, a resident of Jaipur, is a mother of two
 uskaa pati afjal property vyavsaayee he, jise sharaab kii lat he
 One day he made a bet in gambling with one of his friends that he who loses would hand over his wife for one night to another
 is dauraan lika kaa pati afjal jue main shart haar gaya
 He took the farm house on the pretext of rotating, after which he took his wife to his friend's farm house on the pretext of moving
 phir use nashe kii dawa khilaakar apane dost ko saunp diya or duusare kamare main jaakar so gaya
 Meanwhile, Afzal's friend exchanged with his wife
 afjal ne is ghatana kaa ek video bhi banaaya tha
 Afzal did not pay any attention when his wife screamed during the Hallala Zarivardat to adopt again
 baad main usne lika se kaha ki usne use talaak de diya he, isliye use phir se apnaane ke liye halaala jaruri tha
 So he has done all this
 uski baat sunakar lika ke hosh ud gaye
 Afzal also did a rape incident with Laika and brought his wife back home
 or phir sharia kanoon kaa hawala dekar afjal ne bhi apni patni ke saath balaatkaar kiya
 Unhappy and upset with the incident, Laika decided to complain to the police
 vah is maamle kii shikaayat lekar thane gai lekin vahaan uski koi sunwaayee nahin hui
 Said to keep his mouth shut by showing the video of the rape, then husband Afzal silenced her by showing him a video of her rape
 afjal ne lika ko bahala-phusalaakar uske puure parivaar ke saamne kuch paper sin karwaae
 Due to not being educated, he could not understand this
 baad main lika ko pataa chalaa ki ve kaagaj darasaltalaakanamathe
 The police did not intervene due to being connected to religion, and the police advised to resolve the matter jointly, but did not take any action
 lika nau maah se police ke chakkar kaat rahi he, lekin is maamle main ab tak koi giraftaar nahin hui he
 Seeking help from PM Modi, he is now doing a job of three and a half thousand

 The entire family and religious leaders are pressuring the woman to return the money to her husband and withdraw the police case, but Laika wants justice

 satya raghavanhar peedi ke adhyayan or seekhney kaa tarika alag hota he
 In recent years, most Indians acquired a combined education in schools and colleges
 iske alaava unhone apane sahpaathiyon, parivaar ke sadasyon or mitron se bhi bahut kuch siikhaa
 But in today's time when all the information is available instantly - available to more than half a billion Indians at a very low cost - the way of learning is changing rapidly and the credit goes to online video
 behatar connactivity or saste data ke kaaran desh bhar main online video saamagree kaa bahut zyada upyog ho rahaa he
 There has already been a huge amount of content available on various topics like music, technology, travel and lifestyle, but for the last two years, youtube has also become increasingly available on educational topics on youtube in India
 maang or vriddhivaishvik rup se dekhen to utyub par ek din main hi karodon log shaikshanik video dekhte hai
 Even in India, a large number of 'how to' questions are being asked about something on youtube
 desh main hamaare research se pataa chalata he ki yujar utyub par har tarah ke sawaal poochkar uskaa phayda uthaa rahe hai
 Their questions range from everyday trivia (how to tie a tie) to education questions (how to multiply) and new skill learning questions (how to make salsa)
 utyub par uplabdh audio-vijual saamagree se bhartiya yujaron ko duniya bhar ke har tarah ke vishyon par jaankaree lene main madad milti he, ve teji or aasaani se un vishyon ko samaj jate hai
 Interestingly, this trend of learning on youtube is not limited to urban areas only
 ab duusari or teesri shrenee ke shaharon main bhi log kuch bhi seekhney ke liye utyub kaa phayda uthaa rahe hai or apni aajeevika ko behatar bana rahe hai
 a large number of videos are found on youtube on educational subjects such as maths and science to farming and photography, as well as amateur subjects like dance and cooking
 ve lagbhag sabhi bhashaaon main uplabdh hote hai or sabhi aayu varg ke logon ke liye hote hai
 For example, even in villages, many users get answers to their education related questions from the experts of that subject and by learning it, they are succeeding in competitive examinations
 chote shaharon main ab kai shikshak kshetreey bhashaaon—khaskar tamil or hindi—main channel bana rahe hai jo chaatro main bahut lokapriy ho rahe hai
 Brief and accessible content Educational content on youtube is proving helpful for people of all age groups to understand various topics easily
 aajkal kai adhyaaapak apane khud ke channelon par classroom ke lekcharon ke video aplod kar rahe hai
 Channels such as Wifesteady are running online coaching centers and putting up to 30 videos a day that have questions and answers sessions
 is tarah kii saamagree keval swatantra adhyapakon tak hi simit nahin he
 Educational institutions are also taking advantage of its reach and its distribution

 In the past week, robbers with Innova looted two showrooms in the Shalimar Bagh area

 It is worth mentioning that on December 4, the same gang of robbers committed robbery in an LED showroom located just a short distance from Vipin Sahni's showroom in Shalimar Bagh

 This time the robbers also tried to shoot the owner of the showroom when they protested

 Sharing this video, Shilpa wrote that this is the real girl seen in the MMS who tried to discredit her

 On this post of Shilpa, Hina Khan's boyfriend accused her of spreading porn on social media
 phir shilpa ne hina or unke boyfriend ko jawaab dete hue likhaa, 'un sabhi kaa shukriya jo mujhe saport kar rahe hai or jo ye sochate hai ki main galat hum, unase main kahana chaahati hum ki aap sab us vakt kahaan the jab aisa galat video meraa naam lekar viral kiya ja rahaa tha

 Gajraj's anger has still not subsided
 gajraj kaa gussa abhi bhi saatven aasmaan par he
 This can be gauged from the fact that Gajraj attempted to kill another Mahavat within a week, although he somehow escaped from life
 paanch din pehle isi gajraj ne prasiddh sant mauni baba ke kaanvar yatra julus main apane mahavat kii jaan le lee thi
 Panic of Gajraj in the area
 Once again, Gajraj tried to slam his second Mahavat
 haalanki mahavat ne kisi tarah bhaag kar apni jaan bachaa lee
 Then uncontrollable Gajraj's anger started coming out on the passenger vehicles
 enech 84 se guzar rahe kai vaahanon ko gajraj ne dhakka dena shuru kar diya
 It was a good coincidence that the driver survived Gajraj's anger
 is dauraan afratfari much gai
 The wheels of vehicles passing through NH stopped
 kisi tarah police ko soochna di gai
 Panic in the vicinity has been sustained by this origin of sunken elephants
 kheton ke raste log awajahi kar rahe hai
 Gajraj was in a ruckus for about two hours
 ek mahavat kii ja chuki he jangajraj ke gusse ne aath roj pehle ek mahavat kii jaan le lee thi
 This elephant involved in the procession suddenly went mad, after which there was a stampede
 ghatana pichley guuruuvaar kii subah kareeb 8 baje hui thi
 When Mouni Baba's Kanwar Yatra was passing on buxar-ara NH 84 near Pratap Sagar village
 pagal hathi ne juluus main shaamil ek bachche ko apane sudh main lapetakar patakana chaha
 But the Mahavata stopped him
 kisi tarah bachche ko mahavat ne bachaa liya
 But he himself succumbed to his anger
 gajraj ne uski jaan le lee
 Forest department officials said that police of three police stations and Mahavats of other elephants of the district were called to control the unconscious elephant
 lekin, tab bhi hathi kaa gussa shant nahin hua tha
 Later, the elephant department was knocked unconscious by gunmen from Patna Department
 behosh hone ke baad use zanjeer se baandh diya tha
 After this, he had given strict instructions that Gajraj should not be disturbed for at least 15 days
 varanaa iskaa gussa bad saktaa he
 However, this was not done
 phir aapa kho baitha hathigajraj kene mahavat munnu pichley ek saptaah se uske saath tha
 The elephant also got mixed with the Mahavat
 pratap sagar ke paas ped se bandhe uski harakatein saamaanya hota dekh buudhvaar kii subah munnu use aara le jane laga
 For this, the chain of Gajraj was opened
 lekin, ek kilometre tak shanti se chalane ke baad gajraj achaanak bhadak gaya
 He started thundering before reaching Gopal Dera
 tej chinghad ke saath apane peeth par savaar mahavat munnu ko hilaa kar giraane laga
 After falling, Munnu somehow escaped and saved his life
 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne somvaar ko upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ke saamne dwarka sthit shelter home main do naaballig ladakiyon ke shoshan kaa maamla uthaaya or unase is maamle main shelter home kaa prabandhan ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirdeshaanusaar sambandhit jiladhikari ko saunpane kaa anurodh kiya
 The Shelter Home was visited by an expert committee set up by the Delhi Women's Commission to audit the shelter home
 samiti yah dekh dang rah gai thi ki bacchiyon ko dand ke taur par unke guptangon main mirch daali jaati thi
 The girls were beaten with other punishments like scale, for not clearing the room, disobeying the staff
 ladakiyon se shelter home main saare gharelu kaam karwaae jate the
 All this was going on for several months
 ayog dwaara is maamle ko upmukhyamantri ke samaksh uthaaya gaya
 He immediately instructed the Women and Child Development Department to take necessary steps
 is maamle main police ne exiaar darj kii he or yah jaankaree mili he ki staff ke kuch sadasyon ko dilli police ne giraftaar kar liya he
 The Commission has requested the concerned Child Welfare Committee to remove the existing staff of Shelter Home and to deploy new staff
 yah jaruri he ki ladakiyon ko turant acchhee dekhbhaal di jaae taaki wo or zyada peedit mahasoos na karen
 It is important that all girls stay together because living together for a long time has created a deep emotional connection between them
 magar ayog ko yah jaankaree mili he ki do ladkiyaan jinako sabase zyada pratadit kiya gaya tha unako bal kalyaan samiti dwaara duusare home main sthanantarit kar diya gaya he jabaki baaki ladkiyaan shelter home main hi rah gai hai
 Apart from this, no order has been passed on behalf of the committee regarding the staff of Shelter Home
 ayog kaa yah maananaa he ki yah ladakiyon kii pareshaani ko or badhayega, unako lagegaa ki unako sach bolne kii vajah se unako dand diya ja rahaa he, kyonki unako apane doston se dur ek ajanabi jagah par bheja ja rahaa he
 In this case, the President of Delhi Commission on Women wrote to the Deputy Chief Minister in this matter and drew his attention to the guidelines issued by the Women and Child Development of the Government of India on the direction of the Supreme Court
 in disha nirdeshon main kaha gaya he ki agar kisi shelter home main bacchon ke saath pratadna hoti he to ise jeje act kii dhara 30 ke tahat santhaan ke prabandhan, sambandhit bal kalyaan samiti, kishor nyaayalay yaa jila bal sangrakshan ikai ko saunpe gaye dayitvon kii asafalataa, or bacchon ko di jane vaali sevaaon main khalal mana jayega
 In such a case, it is advisable that the concerned District Magistrate should immediately take responsibility of that institution and take over the management of that institution due to the officer in charge of child welfare
 uske baad jiladhikari sthiti kii samiksha karegaa or in maamalon main faisla legaa ki kya santhaan ke sabhi bachche santhaan main hi rahen or santhaan ke prabandhan or staff ko badla jaae or bacchon ko kisi duusare santhaan main sthanantarit kiya jaae

 It often happens that in lovers couples where one is going to make friends very quickly, while the other is going to be very quiet
 aise main kahin baahar ghoomane jane kaa program banane se pehle hi sthagit kar diya jaataa he
 Or even if they had to go for a walk together, both could not enjoy
 aise main agar aapke kisi kareebi dost yaa rishtedaar ke yahaan party ho, to musiibat or bad jaati he
 So when you have to go to a party with your partner, don't bleed him
 koshish karen ki unhen aapke vyavhaar se thes na pahunche
 If you want, you can stop the rift caused by this in the relationship
 
 
 rakhen akelepan ke ahsaas se doormaana ki partiyon main milane vaale doston main zyaadaatar aise hote hai, jo kaaphi lambey arase ke baad aapse milte hai
 Talk to them, but also appreciate your partner's feelings
 vah party main aapke kehane par aaen hai, isliye yah aapaki jimmedaari banati he ki aap unhen akelaapan mahasoos na hone den
 When the two of you go to a party, instead of having fun with your other friends, join your partner and try to make your partner comfortable with them
 agar vah sahaj nahin ho paata, to doston ke bich uski soch ko khud vyakt karen
 Tell your friends what mood he is
 ek baar vah aapke doston ke saath ghulmil gaye, to yakeenan agali party main chalane kii aapse zyada ichha unki hogi
 When you are in any party with your husband, make sure that you manage your husband and friends well
 kuch is tarah kii doston or pati main se koi bhi akelaa mahasoos na karen
 Pay attention to your body language, is it not that she is showing more inclination towards any one
 apane har kaam main unhen bhaagidaar banaaen or unhen mahasoos karaaen ki vah aapke liye har jagah ahmiyat rakhte hai
 Start with small steps, why not be a big task, it starts with a small step
 isliye apane pati ko party animal banane kii shuruyaat bhi ek chote kadam se hi kerani hogi
 Initially take them to a restaurant where they like food very much
 is dauraan unhen ahsaas karaaen ki is tarah se choti choti partiyon main aap unhen kis kadra tak aanandit kar sakati hai
 Gradually introduce them to people
 bas phir kya, vah bhi aapaki hi tarah har party ko dil khol kar enjvaay karne lagenge

 soshal media par pichley kuch dinon se kashmir main taaja halaat kaa daawa karti kai tasviren va video viral ho chuke hai
 Meanwhile, another video is being shared rapidly
 video main kuch logon kii bheed ko police aansu gas ke gole chhod kar teetar-bitar karti najar aa rahi he
 It is being claimed that the viral video is the latest video from Kashmir where the police chased down the people who are taking out the procession of Muharram

 Due to this, when some Muslims took out a religious procession there, the police and paramilitary forces released tear gas shells to disperse the crowd

 It became clear in the investigation that the video going viral is not fresh, but the year 2013
 jab main pehali baar silicon vaili pahunchaa, to hairaan rah gaya
 i was doing research on the success of Indians and came to the conclusion that it is completely merit based
 duk, yusi-bark le or harvard main meri richars tiimon ne yah baat darj kii ki silicon vaili main 52 pratishat nai companiyaan (start-ap) videshon se aae logon ne shuru kii he
 Indian entrepreneurs set up more start-ups than the total migrant groups in Britain, China, Taiwan and Japan
 kaamkaaji aabaadi main sirf chah pratishat anupaat hone ke baavjood bharatiyon ne silicon vaili kii 15 pratishat companiyaan shuru kii hai
 This success is remarkable despite the backwardness of migrants in terms of education and conditions
 maine sochaa ki is hisaab se to silicon vaili ko shesh duniya ke liye misaal hona chahie
 By joining the technology conference of popular blog techcrunch and seeing that the presence of women on stage was just as staff and a circus performer
 vahaan maujuud 100 se adhik companiyon main ek kii bhi mukhiya koi mahila nahin thi
 The audience was mostly young men
 kuch bharat or china se bhi the lekin ve bhi pashchim ke rang main duube hue the
 When i looked at the executive teams of leading technology companies, there was not a single woman among them
 aipal kii puri management team main ek bhi mahila nahin he
 Nearly all of Silicon Valley's investment companies are dominated by men
 unki website par dekhi gai kuch mahilaayein yaa to marketing main thim yaa maanav sansaadhan main
 Venture capital companies (VC) were at the forefront of this matter
 thefunded
 com had only one VC head woman in its 2009 list of 89 Top vcs
 mujhe isse bhi badi hairaani is bare main likhane par hui aalochana se hui
 In a blog for techcrunch in February 2010, i wrote, "silicon Valley: You and some of your vcs have a gender problem
 ’’ iske jawaab main mujhe jis tarah kii nafrat bhari mail, aparipakv online chatter or twitor par vyaktigat hamale jhelane pade usase main hairaan rah gaya
 The email of some highly respected vcs, whom i used to call my friend, shocked me even more
 ek ne mujhase poocha ki is mudde ko is tarah ubhaarne ke peeche meraa agenda kya tha
 Another warned, "this is not the way to achieve success in the Valley
" ’’ kisi or ne poocha ki kya main mahilaon ko rijhaane kii koshish kar rahaa hum or suzav diya ki isse bhi behatar tareeke hai
 Some of these vcs are famous Indians, about whom you often read
 ling bhed kii koi rashtriya yaa nasleey seemaa nahin he
 Since then, i have studied the difference between the atmosphere of male and female entrepreneurs
 sach main to aisa koi antar nahin he
 Male or female, they all have almost the same motivation and success factors
 lekin mahilaon ko purushon ke mukaable zyada badhat hasil hoti he
 The first advantage is that the companies that women have set up are more economical in terms of capital than men
 mahilaon ke netritv main hytech start-ap kii naakaami kii dar kam he
 Venture-backed companies that run women earn 12 percent more annual revenue than men's companies
 isi tarah jin sanghathanon main prabandhan ke ucchstar par mahilaon ko sabase adhik sthaan diya jaataa he, unki equity par phayda 35 pratishat adhik or shairdharakon ke liye kul laabh 34 pratishat adhik hota he
 Keeping women in the Board of Directors also gives better results
 sabase adhik anupaat main mahila board nideshak rakhane vaali companiyaan, sabase kam anupaat vaali companiyon se 53 pratishat behatar pradarshan karti hai
 They earn 42 per cent more on sales and 66 per cent more on invested capital
 silicon vaili main sudhaar kii prakriya chal rahi he
 There is anger at the gender differences being exposed; Solutions are being discussed and implemented; Women are beginning to help each other; And the venture capital system is closely investigating and changing its ways
 is samasya kaa adhyayan karne ke baad maine ek pustak ke sankalan kaa faisla kiya, jisamen mahilaon ke saamne maujuud chunautiyon or un par vijay paane ke tareekon par logon se vichaar maange
 i am happy to learn that more than 500 helping hands went ahead and worked with me in this project
 inamen darjanon haath bharat ke the
 The book titled Innovating Women will be released in September this year
 isamen in mahilaon kii kahani he or inaki kamyaabi ke rahasy bataae gaye hai
 Indian industry should learn from these women
 ity sahit kai bhartiya companiyon ke board main koi mahila nahin he
 Overall, the share of women in the board in India is just 5 percent, while in the US it is 17 percent
 prabandhan ke ucchstar par bhi haalat itani hi kharaab he
 Infosys, Wipro, TCS, Tech Mahindra and other companies hardly have any female executives
 khaas taur par computing ke is nae yug main yah unke liye badi kshati he
 In this era of tablets, apps and cloud computing, IT consumers have access to technology far better than the technology available to their IT departments
 ve apane ipad par saste, shandaar or jaandaar eps downlod kar sakate hai, jinke saamne unke korporate system aadim lagate hai
 These new-age apps do not require software development and maintenance people within the company
 yah eps upabhokta ke anusaar dhaale ja sakate hai or buniyadi programing kaushal se koi bhi inhen bana saktaa he
 That is why the number of outsourced companies and their customers in India is declining, including CIO and IT departments
 aise kai or tarah ke prayaas ho rahe hai, jinase technology kaa puraa paridrishy badal rahaa he, nae kharbon dollar ke maukey paidaa ho rahe hai or inasaanon kii samasyaon ke samaadhaan kaa manch taiyaar ho rahaa he
 Many technologies such as computing, medicine, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, robotics and sensors are making tremendous progress and prices are falling
 masalan, mitti kii nami kii nigaraanee, pani ke adhiktam istemaal or hanikaarak rasayanon kaa istemaal kam se kam karaane vaali kheti se judi pranaaliyon main istemaal ke liye behad saste sensor uplabdh hai
 They can revolutionize farming
 inasaanon kii sehat kii nigaraanee or rogon ke liye pareekshan main kaam aane vaale sensor bhi hai
 Computer apps can combine health data with genomic data to explain the relationship between our genome, habits and diseases
 ve samgr upachaar bhi viksit kar sakate hai
 They can be developed robotic assistants to help care for the elderly and tutors can be prepared to teach crores of children who are deprived of school facilities
 robo menuphaccharing kaa automation kar sakate hai or 3di printers se kahin bhi aadhunik product taiyaar karnaa sambhav he
 Education is important for the development of such technology
 ek se adhik vishay kaa gyaan bahut kaam kaa he
 Today, more women than men are studying various subjects of science, and girls' education and interest in Silicon Valley is much broader than boys
 agar vibhinn vishyon kii shiksha ko mahila kii kshamta or behatar kaam karne kii ichha se jod den to bada taqatvar sanyog banataa he
 That is why women are the most capable in overcoming the enormous challenges of humanity and saving the world
 isiilie unhen padhaanaa or prerit karnaa jaruri he
 The proportion of women studying computer science fell from 37 percent in 1987 in the US to just 17 percent in 2012
 lekin bharat main ity chaatraon kii sankhya bad rahi he
 According to NASSCOM, many IT companies have 24–32 per cent female employees, while their ratio is 34–42 per cent in the BPM business and the female ratio in newly recruited employees is 38–40 per cent
 bharat ko agar technology ke bhavishya par haaavee hone or aglaa 100 arab dollar kaa udyog khadaa karne kaa sapana sach karnaa he, to innovations iconomi main mahilaon ko vah bhoomika deni hogi jisaki ve hakdaar hai

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address to the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort has broken all the records so far
 modi ne 70wein swatantraaa diwas par puure 95 minute tak raashtra ko sambodhit kar apane hi 86 minute kaa pichhlaa record tod diya
 It is a different matter that out of the 95 minutes, for about 80 minutes, the PM kept checking the achievements of his government in the last two years
 aakhir ke 15 minute main aatankwaad ko fatkaaraa or pakistan ko lalakaara
 The impact of the Prime Minister's challenge was that panicked Pakistan invited the leaders of Baluchistan and the Government of India to negotiate
 khayr
 
 
 We were at the ramparts of the Red Fort

 On the morning of 15 August 1947, Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru held talks with the country for 72 minutes, then there were many things to do
 desh ke bhavishya kaa puraa khaakaa kheenchna or yojanaayen bataanaa bhi tha
 An emotional moment
 
 Watch for tough decisions
 
 Time to fasten
 
 
 par iske baad barason tak lalakile kii pracheer se pradhanmantri kaa sambodhan 20 se 50 minute main simatata rahaa
 At times, it felt like ritual

 Sometimes interesting but often boring, monotonous and boring figures

 Apart from this, the most eloquent speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort was only 20 minutes in 1999 by the fiery orator and eloquent PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 2001 main bhi wo aadha ghanta hi bole
 Young Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi also spoke for 25 to 40 minutes

 lakhanu loksabhaa seat se congress ummidavaar acharya pramod krishnam ne ravivaar ko kaha ki congress kii sarkaar aane par vah ayodhya main ramamandir ke nirmaan kaa maarg prashast karenge
 Acharya Pramod said in a conversation with reporters that the Bharatiya Janata Party only does politics at the Ram temple
 piem modi or grahamantri rajnath singh mandir nirmaan ke liye paanch saalon main paanch minute kaa samay nahin nikaal paae, jabaki unki purna bahumat kii sarkaar he
 After the elections, we will start serious efforts to build the temple and pave the way for the temple when the Congress government comes
 bhaajapa mandir nirmaan ko lekar bilkul bhi gambhir nahin he
 'BJP did nothing for Ram temple,' he said, 'for this, talks will be held with all parties and religious leaders
 bhaajapa mandir nirmaan ke naam par sirf propeganda karti he
 But he did nothing in five years
 teen talaak par teen baar adhyadesh le aae par mandir nirmaan ke liye adhyadesh nahin laae
 Acharya Pramod said that he has met many Muslim religious leaders and the ulema
 unka kahana he ki ve log bhi ramamandir nirmaan ke virdohi nahin hai
 He said that after the election, he will sit with all the parties, Muslim religious leaders and saints and pave the way for the construction of the temple

 'let me tell you that Congress has fielded Pramod Krishnam from Lucknow
 krishnam brahman hai or lakhanu seat par brahman ummidavaaron kii jeet-haar tay karte hai
 The Congress, which never spoke openly on the Ram temple issue, has tried to show that it too cares about Ayodhya by giving tickets to the serious proponent of Ram temple, Pramod Krishnam
 acharya krishnam ab tak ayodhya main ram mandir na ban paane ke peeche narendra modi sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraate rahe hai
 Pramod Krishnam has strongly advocated the construction of the Ram temple
 congress kii raajnneeti main khaskar upi se koi aisa netaa nahin he jo ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar mukhar rahaa ho, lekin krishnam iske apwaad hai
 In Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, there has been an effective campaign against the Ram temple

He said, 'it has not been 10 weeks to the new government, but in this short tenure every effort has been made in all areas, we are serving with full dedication

 ' The greatest feature of today's era is that man is stone, heart stone and house stone
 ab aise main agar koi ladki bhare shahar kii kisi patharilii sadak par khanjar ke 26 ghaav kha kar padi tapadapti rahe, sisakati rahe to bhala koi pathar dil insaan uski madad ke liye kyon aage aayega? kahani dilli kii ek ladki kii he
 The story is about a mad boy in one-sided love and the story is about a stoned city where a death occurs among the dead
 uttar dilli ke buraadi ilaake main 20 sitambar ko subah nau baje ek ladki karunaa apni chacheri bahan ke saath ghar se baahar naashte ke liye nikali thi, par tabhi raste main hi uskaa purana computer teacher achaanak uske saamne aa gaya or ladki par lagaataar chaaku se waar karne laga
 Katil was mad in one-sided love: Actually, this story which shocked the heart started about three years ago
 jab karunaa ne ghar ke paas hi computer kii padhai ke liye ek training institute main daakhila liya tha
 The teacher who taught the computer was named Surendra
 computer ke course kii padhai ke dauraan hi surendra ko karunaa se iktarafa ishk ho gaya
 The matter grew so much that the matter reached Karuna's house
 karunaa ke ghar waalon ne police main bhi report likhaai, magar phir baad main donon pariwaron main samjhauta ho gaya
 The agreement is that now Surendra will never tease Karuna nor pursue her
 samjhaute ke baad surendra rohinee shift ho gaya, jabaki karunaa sant nagar main hi naukari karne lagi
 It seemed that everything went well, but it was a hoax
 darasal surendra kii sanak khatm nahin hui thi
 He had gone mad to such an extent of compassion in love that he had decided that if it could not be his, then no one would
 sabake saamne karata rahaa chaaku se hamalaa20 sitambar kii subah nau baje karunaa apni chacheri bahan ke saath lebar chowk ke kareeb se guzar rahi thi
 Suddenly on the bike Surendra reached there
 wo pehle se hi karunaa ko maarane kaa faisla kar aayaa tha
 On seeing Karuna, she dropped her bike on the beach road
 iske baad pehle usee bike par laat maar kar apana gussa nikaala or phir karunaa par tut padaa
 In the very first attack, he inflicted a total of six stabs on Karuna, one after the other
 chathe waar ke baad pehali baar karunaa ladkadaati or sadak par gir padi
 All the people passed by him at that time, Surendra used to attack Karuna with a knife in front of everyone, but no one dared to stop Surendra
 is bich ek shaks ne karunaa ko jarur bachaana chaha, lekin surendra ne use daraa kar bhaga diya
 After this, Surendra attacked Karuna with the same knife that fell to the ground
 abaki baar wo ek ke baad ek kul 16 waar karata he
 Surendra had so far inflicted 22 blows on Karuna in two installments
 phir isi bich uske haath se chaaku phisal jaataa he
 He stands up, but then turns the next moment and now kills Karuna with a kick
 is dauraan ek shaks use rokane ke liye uski taraf badhane kii koshish karata he, lekin surend use bhi daraa kar bhaga detaa he
 Then he sits on the ground and in the third installment karuna kills two more with the same knife
 phir rukta he or aakhirkaar chauthi or aakhri baar wo karunaa par chaaku se aakhri do waar karata he
 After the photo of Karuna dying from the mobile, he takes the mobile out of pocket with great leisure
 kisi kaa number milaataa he or phir usase baat karata he
 He again gets close to Karuna and snatches her mobile and starts breaking it on the road itself
 tab tak sadak par bheed bad jaati he or log use pakadakar peetane lage
 According to an eyewitness, after killing Karuna, he also took a picture of her from his mobile and then sent it to someone on whatsapp and told him that he had killed Karuna
 katl kaa mobile se conectionfilhal police surendra se poochtacha karne kaa intjaar kar rahi he kyonki katl ke baad logon kii pitayee se wo buree tarah jakhmi he
 However, according to people, this incident has some relation with the mobile phones of both, because after the murder, until the people did not control the killer, he had taken out the girl's mobile phone and broke it

 'pasha or kiyani ko thi jaankaree'harsh ne bataaya, ‘sabase jabardast jhooth yah bolaa gaya tha ki pakistan ke do sabase varisht sainya netaaon- general ashfak parvej kiyani (tatkaaleen sena pramukh) or general ahamed shuja pasha (tatkaaleen iesai pramukh) ko america abhiyaan ke bare main kabhi nahin bataaya gaya tha
 'when the Americans approached the Nepakistani government and asked about Osama, the ISI insisted that he be killed and that his death be announced a week after this campaign
 'pakistan ko khabar se laga dhakka'harsh ne kaha, ‘is khabar se pakistan ko dhakka laga
 This was very humiliating for him
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘pakistan ke paas buree nahin balki ek acchhee sena he lekin, is khabar ne use buree dikhne vaali chhavi ke saath pesh kiya
 Harsch also said that doctor Shakeel Afridi, who was jailed in Peshawar, was associated with the CIA to help the CIA in locating Osama's whereabouts but he did not know about the operation

 This is perhaps the biggest blot on the image of Gujarat Police in recent times
 agar vaardaat durbhaagya se modi kii gujarat se centre main tajposhi ke vakt nahin hui hoti to balaatkaar ke aaropee dharmaguru asaram or uske bete narayan sai ke khilaaf mukhya gavaah 57 varshiya amrit prajapati ko goli maarane kii ghatana deshbhar ke media kii surkhiyon main chaa gai hoti
 Prajapati had been exposing the alleged misdeeds of both father and son since 2008
 unhone dharmaguru ke paakhand or mahila anuyaayiyon ke yon shoshan ke vistrut byore sabake saamne pesh kiye the
 Now both father and son have been in jail for almost a year in separate cases
 hamalavar kathith taur par asaram ke samarthak bataae ja rahe hai
 Prajapati was shot at his clinic in Rajkot on 22 May
 do din baad prajapati behoshee main chale gaye the or 10 june ko unki maut ho gai
 Many serious questions have arisen over the role of Gujarat Police in this case
 prajapati kii patni 37 varshiya saroj or unke rishtedaar modibhai prajapati ne bataaya ki vaardaat ke do din baad behoshee main jane se pehle prajapati ne khud paanch sandigdhon ke naam bataae the lekin police ek bhi sandigdh ko giraftaar nahin kar pai he jabaki 18 din baad unki maut hui
 This raised questions as to whether it was the police's inefficiency or that it was worth thousands of crores
 ke asaram ashram kii ore se baari dabaav main he
 Both Narendra Modi and his successor Anandiben Patel in Gujarat are said to be in favor of stern action against Asaram's wrongdoings but reports of complicity with Asaram are also common in the niche of the Gujarat Police
 pichley saal iske saboot us samay bhi mili jab police ke bade adhikariyon ne asaram ke aadamiyon ko chah karod ru
 Was caught with ve yah rakam surat main narayan sai ke maamle kii jaanch kar rahe ek junior police afasar ko dene ja rahe the
 Amount Rs 15 crores
 ke saude kaa hissaa thi
 That police inspector was also arrested
 saroj bhi asaram kii anuyaayi rah chuki hai
 She asks, "is there any doubt who killed them?" Asaram swallowed my husband
 sirf sibiai jaanch se hi sachaai saamne aa sakati he
 "obviously, the Gujarat Police is now on the defensive
" ek varisht adhikari aashwast karte hue kehete hai, ‘‘chaahe jo ho, ham aparaadhiyon ko pakad lenge
 "this statement has also come too late
 adarsh sthiti to yah hoti ki prajapati ko police suraksha muhaiyaa karaati, chaahe unhone khud isaki maang bhale na kii ho
 Prajapati joined the Asaram Ashram in 1989 as the in-charge of the Ayurveda department
 2008 or uske baad prajapati ke media main die bayanon ke mutabik kuch saal baad hi unhen yah khatka ki asaram unase kisi na kisi bahaane sex uttejnaa paidaa karne vaali davaaiyaan banavaa rahe hai
 He alleged that in 1992, he saw Asaram having sex with a female follower at the Ahmedabad ashram and after that many such acts were known
 lekin prajapati ne kaha ki ve asaram ke chelon ke dar ke maare munh kholane se bachate rahe
 Finally in 1996, he got the courage to leave the ashram
 (amrit prajapati)jaahir he, asaram ke chelon kaa aarope he ki prajapati dhokheybaaj tha or uske vidroh karne kii vajah paisa ugaahna tha
 It is also interesting that Asaram's disciples were taught that to question Guru is the biggest sin in the world
 so, unke chelon kaa guru par sawaal uthaane waalon ke khilaaf hamalaa karne kaa purana itihaas he
 Raju Chandak, who raised his voice against Asaram, was also attacked first
 iske alaava, asaram ke kai anuyaayiyon ne aisi dastaane sunai hai ki kaise unhen avaidh sampatti hasil karne or virodhiyon ko chup karaane ke liye hinsak aujaar kii tarah istemaal kiya gaya
 After leaving the ashram in 1996, Prajapati came out openly in 2008 when many followers of Asaram began to speak out against his black acts
 un logon ne mahilaon ke yon shoshan, avaidh sampatti hathiyaane or kaala jaadu karne sambandhi kai aarope lagaae
 Voices were raised in protest against the death of two children in a school in Asaram on the banks of the Sabarmati river after allegedly using black magic
 us maamle main gujarat sarkaar nenyayik jaanch bithai thi, lekin aarope siddh nahin ho sake
 Prajapati also alleged that Asaram's Mahila Ashram in Ahmedabad is a "camp for her concubines"
 unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki asaram sex uttejk davaaiyaan sirf khud hi nahin khaataa tha, balki sahavaas se pehle doodh main milakar mahila ko bhi pilaataa tha
 Incidentally, in Jodhpur last year, the girl with whom Asaram has been in jail for 10 months on charges of misconduct, also said in his statement that he was given milk earlier
 prajapati nidar the
 He often used to hang around with pistols on his side for self-defense, so as to avoid the attacks of Asaram's goons
 prajapati kaa saahas yah bataane ke liye kaaphi tha ki ve anyaay ke khilaaf aawaaj buland kar rahe hai
 He used to elaborate on the misdeeds of Asaram and his son Narayan Sai, and was therefore very popular in the media
 unke dost akasar asaram kii takat se unhen saavdhaan kiya karte the lekin asaram ke khilaaf prajapati main maano koi jununee tevar tha
 His life's mission was: to bring Asaram's actions to a logical end
 haalanki ve rahete ahmedabad main the or hafte main ek baar vadodara or rajkot kii clinics main jate the, lekin apane mishan ke liye bhi samay nikaal lete the
 Of course, his murder is like a break in the fight against the hypocrites of religion

 Spread to the horizon, muddy till death, angry, black-wave-like, with poison, the meru, the rest of the lord, and the Suresh, know an ocean, how do you think of it? Just like a dense forest, drowned in sleep by the unborn

 beete disambar main dilli main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main apratyaashit kamyaabi hasil karne vaali aam aadmi party kii najar ab aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav par he
 The distance of Parliament from Delhi Assembly is just seven kilometers but this journey is not so easy for Arvind Kejriwal's party
 aam chunaav se pehle karaae gaye india today group / si voter survey ke mutabik aam aadmi party ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main 10 siten mil sakati hai
 According to the survey, the party is expected to get eight percent of the total vote share
 is tarah vot share ke hisaab se aam aadmi party desh main tisare number kii party ban sakati he
 However, there is still a long time to go for the general election
 adhiktar rajyon main aam aadmi party kaa santhnik dhaancha bhi nahin he
 Even in many areas, the party has not started its campaign
 aise main agle kuch maheene main party ke vot share main sudhaar hone kaa anumaan he
 It is believed that the percentage of vote share will improve by five percent in the coming days and thus the party can get 30 seats
 aisa hua to aam aadmi party congress or bijepi ke baad teesri sabase badi party ban sakati he
 If the party exerts some more force, the figure may reach around 50
 aisi sthiti main kejariwal 'king' to nahin lekin 'kingmekar' jarur ban sakate hai
 If the vote share of the Aam Aadmi Party is more than 25 percent then the party can get more than 300 seats and in such a situation Kejriwal's party can form the government at its own center
 aisa hona asambhav bhi nahin he kyonki survey main shaamil logon main se 70 fisadi kaa maananaa he ki aam aadmi party loksabhaa chunaav main bhi dilli vidhansabha chunaav jaisaa pradarshan karne main sakasham hogi
 Taking a U-turn from his earlier stand, Arvind Kejriwal said in a TV interview on 18 January, 'if people of my party want, i will contest the Lok Sabha elections
 ' kejariwal ke aatmavishvaas kii vajahen bhi hai
 Kejriwal is the most liked non-bjp and non-congress prime ministerial candidate, with 37 per cent of those polled
 gauratlab he ki kareeb chah maheene pehle beete saal agast main karaae gaye aise hi ek survey ke mutabik keval ek fisadi logon ne unhen is shrenee main sabase pasandida piem ummidavaar mana tha
 There has been no change in Mayawati's popularity as a non-bjp and non-congress PM candidate
 agast main hue survey main bhi saat fisadi log mayawati ko apni pehali pasand maanate the or aaj bhi yahi haal he
 In this way, Mayawati retains the second position in this list
 kejariwal ke liye isse badi khushi kii baat yah he ki dilli kaa siem banane ke ek maheene ke bheetar hi unhone gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi se 'best siem' kaa taj chin liya he
 25 per cent of the people surveyed believe that Kejriwal is the most honest politician in the country
 haalanki, aalochak is baat se sahamat nahin dikh rahe hai ki aam aadmi party agle aam chunaav main shandaar pradarshan karegi
 They say that the party lacks a strong organization to contest elections at the national level
 iske alaava, chunaav abhiyaan ke liye fund jutaney yaa vigyaapan / piaar agent ko hair karne ke liye bhi kam vakt bachaa he
 However, the party has once again begun to change the pattern of politics in its own way
 aam aadmi party loksabhaa chunaav ladane ke icchhuk logon se form bharva rahi he or bade jor-shor se sadsyta abhiyaan chalaa rahi he
 These steps of the party can benefit in the next general election
 ummid he ki kuch hafton main kareeb 20 lakh log yaa to online yaa 'main bhi aam aadmi' abhiyaan ke tahat party se jud jaaenge
 If a non-congress, non-bjp government is formed in the country, who would be your first choice as Prime Minister?

 unhone kaha, 'yah ek raajnneetik kranti he jiske ham gavaah bane hai
 But there are many obstacles in this journey of 'aap'
 party kaa saport base ab bhi behad loklijd he jo dilli, haryana, punjab or uttarakhand jaise chand rajyon tak simit he
 If the vote share of the party in these states is very high, then the party is not going to get anything in the south and east states
 haalanki, 'aap' ne uttar bharat ke ahm rajyon jaise uttar pradesh, bihar, rajasthan or haryana main bade paimaane par taiyaari shuru kar di he
 According to a senior AAP leader, the party will now focus on states like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh where the party's organization is already ready
 akele maharashtra main 3 lakh se adhik log party se jude chuke hai or isane rajya main 34 jilon main daftar khole hai
 Among the senior leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party are Yogendra Yadav from Haryana, Mayank Gandhi and Anjali Damania from Maharashtra, while Sanjay Singh and Kumar Vishwas can contest the Lok Sabha elections from UP
 gujarat, uttar pradesh or karnataka kii party unit ne bhi sanket die hai ki wo loksabhaa chunaav ke liye taiyaar hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has formed a three-member National Publicity Coordination Committee comprising Yogendra Yadav, Sanjay Singh and Pankaj Gupta to tackle the challenges faced by the southern states in their quest to hold their own and to raise funds and election of candidates
 Such as senior leaders
 is samiti ko ab tak 200 se adhik ummidavaaron ke aavedan mil chuke hai, inamen adhiktar bihar or haryana jaise rajyon se hai
 Sanjay Singh said in a conversation with India Today, 'our campaign in the southern states is a bit slow, but we are working hard
 karnataka, tamilnadu or kerala main bade paimaane par sadsyta abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he
 'the party's plan is to register its presence in more than 50 percent of the districts in each state
 'aap' ke senior netaaon kaa kahana he ki party aam chunaav main bhi vahi ranneeti apnayegi jo dilli vidhansabha chunaavon main apanaai gai thi
 Issues and party messages will be decided for each district
 party ke kaaryakartaaon kii fouj ye sandesh ghar-ghar jaakar logon tak pahunchaayegi
 According to the party's IT cell, the digital marketing strategy will be such that pages will be created on Facebook for each district where local residents can discuss their problems
 lekin, party ke paas ab bhi koi vyapak rashtriya niti nahin he
 Kejriwal says, 'swaraj is our goal
 ' unke mutabik aam chunaav se pehle 'aap' kii aarthik or videsh niti desh ke saamne rakhi jaaegi
 a seven-member committee has been formed to formulate the party's economic policy comprising Meera Sanyal, former chairperson of Royal Bank of Scotland (india), environmentalist Aseem Shrivastava, economist Lavish Bhandari and former CEO of Idea Cellular Sanjeev Aga
 dilli sarkaar ke faislon or iske kaam karne ke tareekon ko lekar party ke bheetar or baahar asantosh punap rahaa he

 garvanence ke bajaay sadak kii raajnneeti ke prati kejariwal cabinet ke jhukaav par sawaal uth rahe hai
 According to well-known historian Ramchandra Guha, Kejriwal's dharna demanding action against the policemen would take a major blow on the party's candidates
 guha kehete hai, 'dilli main jo kuch ho rahaa he iskaa deshbhar main galat asar padegaa
 Kejriwal and his government need to rethink and perhaps focus only on the governance of Delhi

 The night of October 9, 2012, hardly anyone can forget when the tehreek-e-taliban, who were ambushing Malala's candidates, attacked immediately

 Malala was sent to another country for treatment

 It was a victory of the campaign that wanted girls to have the right to education

 The announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize further reinforced Malala's belief that, beyond any terror and terror, the fundamental right of girls of every country full of strong intentions cannot be prevented and achieved with peace

 However, expressing dissatisfaction with the foreign minister's statement, opposition members, including the Congress, started a ruckus, demanding the Prime Minister come to the House and clarify
 congress netaa rahul gandhi ne twit karte hue kaha ki piem modi desh ko bataaen ki trump ke saath baithak main kya baatcheet hui
 Rahul tweeted, 'president Trump said that PM Modi had asked him to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir issue
 agar yah sach he to piem modi ne 1972 ke shimla samjhaute or bharat ke hiton ke saath dhokhaa kiya he
 The Prime Minister should tell the nation what was the conversation between Trump and him
 'president Trump says PM Modi asked him to mediate between India & Pakistan on Kashmir! If true, PM Modi has betrayed India's interests & 1972 Shimla Agreement
 a weak Foreign Ministry denial won't do
 PM must tell the nation what transpired in the meeting between him & @POTUS Another Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said, "we are ready to trust our PM, provided they come to the House and say Trump's statement is false
" piem ke videshi dauron ke baad sadan main bayaan dene kii parampara rahi he par piem modi ne 6 saal main ise tod diya
 If they play it, they don't know about it

 bayaan main videsh mantri ne kaha, ‘‘ham sadan ko puri tarah aashwast karnaa chahenge ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne aisa koi anurodh nahin kiya he
 "any dialogue with Pakistan will be within the Lahore Declaration and the Simla Agreement after the ongoing cross-border terrorism," he said
 ''videsh mantri ne yah bhi kaha ‘‘ham apana ruukh phir se doharaate hai ki pakistan ke saath sabhi lambit muddon kaa samaadhaan dwipaksheeya tareeke se hi kiya jayega
 The Foreign Minister said that the US President said in a conversation with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday that he was ready to mediate on the Kashmir issue if requested
 jaishankar ne kaha ‘‘america raashtrapati se is tarah kaa koi anurodh nahin kiya gaya he
 'opposition members were not satisfied with his statement and started a ruckus demanding the Prime Minister come to the House and give clarification
 sabhapati ne sadasyon se shant rahane or shoonyakaal chalane dene ko kaha lekin sadan main vyavastha banate na dekh unhone 11 baj kar 15 minute par baithak dopaher baarah baje tak ke liye sthagit kar di

 Naidu said that although he has not accepted these notices, the issue is of national importance so he will give the members an opportunity to speak on it

 This is against the interest of farmers "
 congress ke rukh se saaf he ki nae zamin adhigrahan bill par sansad main aage badhanaa sarkaar ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 The problem is that the opposition is mobilizing against this bill and passing it in Rajya Sabha without political consent can prove to be a difficult challenge for the NDA government

 With the demonetization process, there is a strong belief in the common man that in the whole process, the treasury of the central government will be filled with black money coming out, the banks will be rich and in the end the common man will benefit
 makaan, gaadi or anya nijee jaruraton ke liye karj lenaa aasaan hoga
 The additional money reached to the banks would have cleared the way for reducing interest rates
 sarkaar ke khajaane main aayaa paisa garibon ke liye yojanaon main kharch kiya jayega or amir or garib main antar ko paat diya jayega
 This can no longer be expected
 kendriya rigerv bank ne desh ke bainkon ke paas ekatrit ho rahe 500 rupee or 1000 rupee (18 november tak 6 lakh karod rupee) kiamaanya karency ko inkremental cash rigerv reshio ghoshit kar diya he
 This means that this money with the banks cannot be returned to the market
 is paise par use rigerv bank se kisi tarah kaa koi byaaj nahin milegaa
 This money will remain with the banks till a piece of waste paper until the central government does not provide a new currency to the banks in lieu of this money 
 vahiin, kendra sarkaar ne ab 500 rupee or 1000 rupee kii amaanya karency ko badalane par pratibandh bhi laga diya he
 These notes can now be deposited only in bank accounts till 30 December
 kendra sarkaar kaa anumaan he ki jamaa karne kii antim taarikh tak bainkon ke paas lagbhag 10 lakh karod rupee kii amaanya karency ekatrit ho jaaegi
 Anshuman Tiwari, India Today's editor and expert in economic affairs, revived the banks' hopes that the Reserve Bank's decision to increase the CRR has put banks in trouble
 unke mutabik jahaan notebandi kii prakriya ke baad bainkon ko ummid thi ki jamaa hue atirikt dhan kii madad se vah byaaj daron main katautee kar lenge or is atirikt dhan ko nae karj ke rup main bazaar main waapas daal denge
 Now this is not possible
 bainkon par asar1
 Most of the money deposited in the banks came out of the common man's pocket, which was kept for consumption (spending)
 yah paisa aise samay main bank pahunchakar kharaab ho chukaa he jab arthvyavastha ko maang badhane kaa besabri se intjaar tha
 2
 kalaadhan rakhane vaale logon ne niyamon kaa phayda uthaate hue jandhan khaaton or garib janata ke khaaton main paisa jamaa karakar apane dhan ko sambhavat: surakshit karne main safalataa paa lee he
 This is the reason that 21 thousand crores have been deposited in Jan Dhan accounts in just 16 days
 3
 As soon as the demonetisation process began, the banks hurriedly changed the banned currency
 isse uske paas puraani noton kaa ambara lag gaya
 Now the new currency is not being given to the Reserve Bank for the work of changing it and the old currency has been given an order to keep it with itself
 4
 While the bank hoped that it would increase its business manifold by giving new loans, now it has a problem of running old accounts
 jabatak rigerv bank is pratibandhit karency se use mukt nahin karata vah apane maujuuda graahakon or nae graahakon ko liye koi nai skim nahin laa saktaa
 The demonetization that he was considering as a cure for his illness has become the biggest disease for him today
 5
 On December 7, the Reserve Bank is coming out with a new monetary policy
 is niti main yadi vah repo rate main katautee bhi kar de to bainkon ke liye byaaj daron main katautee ko aage badhanaa naammumkin he
 This restricted currency kept with him has now become the largest NPA
 aam aadmi par asarrijrv bank ke is faisle kaa sabase bada asar aam aadmi par padana tay he
 First of all, the new data on the black money of the Reserve Bank will allow to eliminate its perception that it is going to benefit in the demonetisation process against black money in the country
 iske saath hi uski kai or ummiido par pani phirana tay hai -1
 By taking steps to curb black money, the common man hoped that the bank would announce a big cut in its interest rates
 isse use ghar, gaadi, kaarobaar jaise anya praayojanon ke liye karj saste daron par mil jayega
 2
 aam aadmi ko ummid thi ki bank kii badi aamadani ke chalate use phixd diposit or anya bachat skim par acha interest milegaa
 But the current decision has cleared the way for banks to discontinue popular schemes such as fixed deposits
 bina kisi kamai ke bank aise ofer nahin dene ja rahi he
 3
 desh ke sabase bade sarkari bank state bank of india ne maujuuda sthiti ko dekhte hue bachat bank khate par interest rate ghataakar 4 fisadi se kam kar diya he
 With this decision of the Reserve Bank, it will no longer be so tempting for the common man to deposit money in banks

 film kaa naam:te3ndayarektara:ribhu dasguptaster cast:amitabh bachchan, navazuddin siddiki, vidya balivadhi:2 ghanta 16 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:3 staffmitabh bachchan, navazuddin siddiki or vidya baalan kii maujuudagi main diarector ribhu dasgupta ne ek thriller film banaai he
 However, before this, Ribhu made a 'war' serial which was disliked by the audience
 aaie jaanate hai kisi he ye film
 
 
 Story: The story of the film is of an Anglo Indian family based in Kolkata, in which John Biswas (amitabh Bachchan) lives with his wife
 kinhi kaarnon se jon kii potee angela kii maut ho jaati he or kaatil kaa pataa lagane ke liye jon, police inspector sarita sarkaar (vidya baalan) or carch ke fadar martin (navazuddin siddiki) se aksar milte julate rahete hai
 Then there are many such ups and downs in the story due to which it becomes very difficult to find the killer
 ab kya jon, martin or sarita kii ye koshish sarthak siddh hogi? kya kaatil kaa pataa chal paaegaa? ye jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Script: The film is inspired by the South Korean film Montaz, whose rights producer Sujoy Ghoshne has tried to make 'TE3N'
 film kii kahani acchhee he, jo ki parat dar parat aapako suspence main baandhe rakhti he
 Shooting the actual location in the film is also very interesting, through which you can see the city of Kolkata quite well
 film kaa first half lambaa he, lekin second half kii raftaar sahi he
 Acting: Amitabh Bachchan has done a great job in the film as Dada
 vahiin navazuddin siddiki ek baar phir se apane umdaa abhinay ke jariye aapkaa dil jeet lenge
 Vidya Balan in the role of a cop also makes this story even more interesting
 film kii baaki casting bhi kirdaaron ke hisaab se sahi he
 Weak link: The weak link of the film is its pace, the first half seems to be long and while watching the film you will have to focus all your attention on it because there are many sequences that you miss, then the story moves forward
 sangeet:film kaa sangeet or becoground score acha he jo aapako kahani se baandhe rakhata he
 Haq, Kyun Re and Eclipse are good songs

 kabira khadaa bazaar main liye lulathi haath, jo ghar jaare aapano aae hamaare saath
 "500 years ago, when Fakkar saint Kabir was saying these inversions for social reform or self-improvement, it may have come to his mind that one day there will be a conspiracy in the name of Kabirpanth
 sadiyon se vanchit logon ko samaaj main sammaan or sachaai kaa rasta dikhaata rahaa kabirpanth jab barwaala ke rampal ke daravaaje se gujara to uski chaal hi badal gai
 After leaving the job as a junior engineer of the irrigation department, Baba landed in the business of Babagiri and called himself an avatar of Sant Kabir, this Baba is seen to be completely anti-kabir in his conduct
 kabir ghar jalaane kii baat kehete the to vah to 12 acre ke satalok ashram main rahata tha, jo buland daravaajon ke saath hi chaaron taraf oonchi charadivari se ghira he
 When Rampal was arrested and the police took him with him, he got a chance to see the ashram from inside
 yahaan har cheez bhavy, aaleeshaan or vishaal najar aati he
 There is a huge pandal in which more than five thousand people can listen to the discourse at once
 jaahir he, pravachan sunaane vaala kathith avtari purush saamne manch par oonche asana par baithta hoga
 There are pictures of Kabir Das ji seated on the throne at various places, and in most of the places blessing Baba
 puraa parisar sisitivi camaron kii jad main he
 In such a hall is placed a throne, on which Baba himself probably used to sit
 baba kaa kila dhahne ke baad haryana police ke javaanon main is singhaasana par baithne kii hode lagi he or bade afasar apane maatahaton ko mobile pakadaakar badi akad ke saath photo khinchvaa rahe hai
 Some devotees claimed that Baba was so proud of egoism and devout blindness that Baba was first bathed with milk and kheer made from this milk was distributed as offerings to the devotees
 chunki ashram main bhakt badi sankhya main rahete the, iske alaava lungar bhi salbhar chalata rahata tha, lihaaja yahaan kii rasoi bhi bahut vishaal he
 The cooking utensils are as big as the stone bath tub of Mughal emperor Jahangir kept in the Red Fort of Agra
 logon ko bhagwaan kii puja na karne, kisi bhi tarah ke havan or upwas se dur rahane or nashe se puri tarah se tauba karne kii hidaayat dene vaale baba kaa shayankaksh aaleeshaan he
 Here instead of the fakery of a Kabirpanthi, some Shah's rai is dripping
 kamare main paisa rakhane ke liye tijori bhi rakhi he
 The doors of the ashram are locked with automatic locks, whose code the police are unable to find
 ashram main upar-neeche jane ke liye chamchamati lift lagi hai
 Baba did not have full confidence in this modern security, so the petrol bomb was kept near the boundary wall
 baba ko bachaane ke liye bhakton ne yahaan chal rahe nirmaan kaary ke pathar bhi police par phenkane ke liye rakhe the
 However, no stock of state-of-the-art weapons has come to the police, which was being claimed earlier
 baba ab jail main he or uskaa durg sannaate main bhaany-bhaany kar rahaa he
 Devotees have freed their homes
 aane vaale dinon main nishchit taur par usase judi or kahaniyaan saamne aaengi
 Walking out of the ashram, Kabir's voice remembered - "old man Kabir's, fertile pot Kamal

 is maamle main bijepi ko jhootha sabit karne ke liye unhone sansad kii kaarywahi khatm hone ke baad buudhvaar shaam ko twit kiya
 In the tweet, Rahul Gandhi taunted the BJP, saying that thanks for reminding that what our PM says does not make sense or PM does not say what he understands in real
 Dear Mr Jaitlie - thank you for reminding India that our PM never means what he says or says what he means

 Along with this, Rahul Gandhi also shared the video of the speech given during the Gujarat election rally and Jaitley's statement in Parliament today
 aapako bataa den ki buudhvaar ko jab christmas kii chhuttiyon ke baad sansad satr shuru hua to mukhya vipakshi dal congress kii demand ke baad rajyasabha main vitt mantri arun jetali ne is masale par safai di
 Leader of the House Arun Jaitley responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks in a two-line statement about which the Congress was not allowing Parliament to function for several days
 lunch ke baad arun jetali ne apane bayaan main kaha, 'piem modi ne apane bhaashan main purvapiem manmohanaya purv uparashtrapati hamid ansaari kii deshbhakti or nishtha par koi sawaal nahin khadaa kiya or na hi unki aisi koi manshaa thi
 Any such assumption is wrong
 ham in netaaon kaa sammaan karte hai, saath hi desh ke liye unki patibaddhta ko bhi maanate hai
 After this very brief statement by Jaitley, the Leader of the Opposition in the state and Congress MP Ghulam Nabi Azad gave the statement
 unhone kaha, 'ham netaa sadan ke bayaan kaa sammaan karte hai
 i also want to say that we ourselves do not want to lower the dignity of the Prime Minister's post
 isliye ham bhi chunaav prachaar ke dauraan pradhanmantri ke khilaaf kii gai kisi tippanee or bayaan kaa samarthan nahin karte hai
 No derogatory statement should be made against the Prime Minister
 'arun jetali ke is jawaab ke saath pichley hafte hangaame kii bhent chadhi sansad kii kaarywahi sucharu rup se shuru ho gai
 The Congress further expressed confidence of letting the House run properly
 haalanki rahul gandhi ke twit se yah baat saaf ho gai he ki bhale hi sansad main yah masalaa khatm ho gaya ho, lekin sansad ke baahar vah bijepi par is masale par waar karte rahenge

 Even after the breakup, his tremendous craze in the film showed his magic at the box office and the film proved to be a big hit
 salmaan or katrina cafactrina kii film 'boom' ke buree tarah se peetane ke baad salmaan ne apni ladi lav ko bataur brake 'maine pyaar kyon kiya' ofer kii, jo ki flop sabit hui
 After this, these two appeared together in 'yuvraj' but this film could not show any special feat

 This proves that after the breakup, they also played more magic on the screen

 It was during his love story that his film 'bachna Ae Haseeno' which did not work its magic, but the films that came after the breakup did wonders at the box office

 Hardly any Indian cricket fan would have forgotten this semi-final match played at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata
 romesh kaaluwitarna, sanath jayasoorya or ashanka gurusimha 35 ranon tak pavilion laut gaye the lekin iske baad arvind disilva or roshan mahanama ne milakar tamaam indian phans kaa dil tod diya tha

 The noise of that is still heard today

 iske baad se team india number-1 test ranking hasil kiya or 2011 world cap jeet chuki he

 Team India has had a great journey so far in the tournament, in which its players performed brilliantly, winning five consecutive matches including the semi-finals
 lakshya kaa peechha karnaa ho yaa bada score bananaa ho, dhoni ke dhurandharon ne har maukey par behtareen khel dikhaaya he
 The spinners, led by r Ashwin, turned the match with their best efforts, while the batsmen, led by Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, ensured that they helped them win the match without any regard for the bowlers' contribution
 ab tak nahin padi he dhoni kii jarurat
 
 
 The impact of the young players was so great that Dhoni, considered the best player of this format, is not needed in the difficult situation
 lekin phir bhi dhoni ahm khilaadi hai
 The Sri Lankan team and especially Nuan Kulasekara cannot easily forget their helicopter shot in the 2011 ODI World Cup final at Wankhede Stadium

 tii-20 cricket main 1000 ran puraa karne vaale 17wein khilaadi banane se yuvaraj singh 43 ran peeche hai
 If Kumar Sangakkara completes 5 victims behind the wicket, then in this case, he will be in trouble

 Indian cuisine may be more spicy than China's hotpot and India's economy may also have a higher temperature than China
 is samay jab china main jarurat se zyada tej aarthik vikaas (overheating) kii charchaa he to bharat main bhi arthvyavastha kii vikaas dar khul rahi he
 (the Economist, November 2006) What the leaders of Congress would like to recall is that India's growth rate in the second quarter of 2006-07 was 8 when the nda's GDP figures changed formulas to the UPA era
 9 fisadi pahunch gai thi, tab ve kya kah rahe the? upie sarkaar ashankit thi bharat kii vikaas dar kuch zyada hi tej ho gai he
 Therefore, it is not wrong to increase the interest rate by reducing the demand for loans
 jidipi ke nae aitihaasik aankadon ke mutabik, isi dauraan bharat kii vikaas dar ne pehali baar das fisadi kii manzil par hajiri lagaai thi
 And what does the BJP have to say! In February 2015, when it changed the basis and formula for calculating GDP (growth rate of economic output), then we wrote in this column that whenever these figures are found in the past, the UPA era will shine i
e
 the recession and unemployment environment
 Had opened the way for bjp's unprecedented victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it will never be seen in these new figures
 jidipi ke nae formule or base year main badlaav se jo aankade hamen mili hai unke mutabik upie ke das saal ke do kaarykalon main aarthik vikaas dar 8
 Grew at 1 per cent pace with two years (2007-08, 2010-11) of ten per cent growth and two years of five per cent and below
 modi sarkaar ke netritv main ausat vikaas dar 7
 It was 3 percent
 jidipi gananaa kaa nayaa tarika vaigyanik he
 The Congress will hone in on this figure and the BJP would like to end the debate forever that its growth rate was faster than the UPA because the Prime Minister, from the summit of the Red Fort a day before the new figures came out, led India's record economic growth
 The growth rate was cheered
 lekin siyasat se pare kya hamaare netaa yah siikhnaa chahenge ki aarthik aankade anaath nahin hote, unka ateet bhi hota he or bhavishya bhi or ye aankade unki siyasat ke nahin is desh kii adkvay aarthik chetana ke hai
 These new numbers tell us something that was probably not seen before
 pichley do dashakon main bharat aarthik jijeevishaa or vaishvik sampark kii anokhi kahani ban chukaa he
 When the growth rate in the world economy is fast, India grows faster than the world as it was during the UPA-I era
 lekin jab duniya kii vikaas dar girti he to bharat jatke se ubar kar sabase teji se saamne aa jaataa he
 In 2008, a year after the Lehman crisis, India's growth rate returned to ten percent
 pichley do varshon main duniya kii vikaas dar main teji najar ai
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that in 2018 it will be 3
 9 fisadi rahegi
 a decade later, world trade also surpassed the average growth rate of three percent (2 in 2016

 Increased by 7 percent

 Now, we have to worry about dozens of small big economies (regions, states, cities) which are within India

 Constant structural reforms, the government becoming smaller and smaller and the development clean

 These figures, which are in a period of great turmoil (2004-2018), show that despite the innumerable state of politics, the ups and downs of the situation and the thousand challenges, this country knows how to seize opportunities and move forward
