 chhattisgarh kii rajdhani raipur ke ek bangale main naukaraani kii laash milane se sansani fail gai
 The bungalow is owned by a five-star hotel
 35 varshiya naukaraani ke sir or gardan par dhardaar hathiyaar se hamalaa kar uski hatya kii gai
 a security guard of the bungalow has been absconding since the incident
 raipur ke ek paanch sitara hotel ke maalik jagajeet singh khanuja ke bangale main puja ghar ke peechheghar kii naukaraneesejani nishad kii khun se sani laash baraamad hui to hadakamp much gaya
 The corpse was covered with insects, moths and ants
 laash ke paas hi khun se sanaa ek tangiya padaa tha
 The clothes of the deceased were busy
 pehle najar main dekhne se jaahir ho rahaa tha ki uske saath anhoni hui he
 Because the back of the house was deserted
 yahi vajah rahi hogi ki kisi ne bhi sajani kii cheekh pukaar nahin suni
 However, half a dozen employees were present in the bungalow at the time of the incident
 magar hairaani kii baat he ki naa to kisi ne hamalaa hote dekha or naa hi hamalavar
 Police are searching for footage of CCTV in the bungalow
 bangale main tainaat ek anya suraksha guard ne police ko bataaya ki usne hatya kii khabar milane ke kareeb do teen ghante pehle apane saathi guard sadhelaal divakar ko bangale se baahar jate hue dekha tha
 Sandhee Guard Sadhelal Diwakar hails from Mungeli district
 police uski talash kar rahi he
 Police have sent the body to the Medical College for post-mortem after the Panchnama action
 bataaya jaataa he ki sajani ke do chote-chote bachche hai uskaa pati fishari vibhaag main kaam karata he
 Sajni Nishad, a resident of Phundhar, was working in this bungalow for the last two and a half years
 vah rojaanaa subah 9 se 5 baje tak vahaan duty karne ke baad ghar jaati thi
 While the guard Sadhe Lal came under suspicion had been working in the bungalow for 6 years
 vah usee parisar main rahata tha
 After looking at the primary evidence, the police are acting as the accused as the guard
 hotel kaarobaari ne police ko bataaya ki vaardaat ke vakt unke bangale main koi nahin tha
 All the family members went out of the house to attend a wedding ceremony
 mangalvaar ko supreme court ne november 2016 main die apane order ko badalte hue kaha ki ab cinema haul main film shuru hone se pehle raashtra gaan bajaane kii jarurat nahin he
 However, the court said that citizens should show respect to the husband of the national anthem
 jab is bare main kaajol se poocha gaya to unhone kaha- main desh ke kisi or naagarik ke liye kuch nahin kah sakati, lekin main jab bhi raashtra gaan sunati hum, main khadi ho jaati hum
 In 2016, when the Supreme Court ordered that the national anthem be played before the film started in the cinema hall and the audience present there would have to stand in respect, many people in the Hindi film industry objected to it
 is vajah se bigade rani mukherjee ke apni bahan kaajol se rishte?'svachh aadat svachh bharat' campan ke launch ke maukey par kaajol media se baat kar rahi thim
 At the event, he was also asked about the tax imposed by the government on sanitary napkins
 jahaan kai actors ne sanetary napkin ko tex free karne kii maang uthaai he, vahiin kaajol is par sidhaa jawaab dene se bachati najar ain
 Kajol became a TROLL by sharing the photo, Kamal Haasan said - sparingly, he said - i do not know much about economic matters
 jahaan tak sanetary napkin kii baat he to doodh or chaaval par bhi tex he
 i think the government knows what is right
 Xiaomi kaa ek popular smartphone Redmi Note 3 jiskaa aglaa varjan yani Redmi Note 4 he or company daawa karti he ki yah bharat main sabase zyada bikne vaala smartphone he
 It is common for the phone to go bad, but it is a bit strange to not have it repaired
 sabase jyaad problem customers ko tab hoti he jab unhen 10 hajaar rupee main kharide gaye smartphone ko banavaane ke liye 7,500 rupee maange jate hai
 You cannot even say that the smartphone is bad, because the smartphone is in good condition and it is running like a new smartphone
 lekin achaanak se charge hona band ho gaya or jab customer sarvice centre jaataa he, to pehle use kaha jataa he lagbhag 500-600 rupee main baat ban jaaegi
 But in a short time it is known that they have to pay Rs 7,500
 ye sun kar customer ke paas do opshan hote hai yaa to phone banavaa le yaa usee keemat main nayaa phone kharid le
 Because smartphones with specifications like Redmi Note 3 are present in the market for Rs 7,500
 taaja maamla he noida ke rahane vaale ranjit singh hai jinhonepichhali diwali par Redmi Note 3kharida tha
 According to him, he always charged it with the original charger and bought the power bank also from Xiaomi
 aaj achaanak se phone charge hona band ho gaya
 To make the phone, they go to Satguru Communication, the Xiaomi Authorized Service Center in Noida
 pehle kaha jaataa he ki smartphone repere kar diya jayega
 In a while, the service center said that the charging point has gone bad and for this you will have to pay Rs 7,500
 aisa isliye kyonki company puraa madraboard riples karegi or componant nahin badla ja saktaa he
 It was quite surprising for Ranjit Singh, as he bought this smartphone for around 10,000 under the Diwali offer
 aisi sthiti koi bhi hairaan ho saktaa he
 Because the condition of the phone is very good and only 7,500 rupees are being paid for the charging jack
 unhone hame bataaya, ‘sarvice centre ne iske liye ek bill diya he jis par likhaa he ki ise banane ke liye 7,500 rupee lagenge
 This is a Sarasam scam, because to what extent is it correct to ask for Rs 7,500 for a Rs 10,000 phone just for a charging jack? In this new smartphone can be purchased
 sarvice centre dwaara kiye gaye is ravaiye se unhone pareshaani auraniraash jataai he or hamen bataaya he ki company kois bare kaarywai kerani chahie
 Because giving Rs 7,5000 in case of no charging is absolutely wrong
 gauratlab he ki yah smartphone achche condishan main he koi bhi physical daimaj nahin hua he
 This event raises many questions on the status of smartphone service
 isisi vishwa cap (50 over) ke 11wein sanskaran main 14 kii bajaay 10 timen hissaa lengi jabaki aagaamee twanti-20 vishwa cap main hissaa leni vaali tiimon kii sankhya 12 se badhkar 16 ho jaaengi
 a total of 14 teams are participating in the 10th edition of the ICC World Cup to be hosted jointly by India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka
 isisi ne vishwa cap ke aayojan ke sambandh main kiye gaye pherbadal kii shuukravaar ko jaankaree di
 ICC Chief Executive Aaron Logart gave the news of happiness to India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh during this period
 teenon timen is vishwa cap ke nokout daur tak apane sabhi match apane hi desh main khelengi
 Logart said, "in the coming days, the lower ranked teams will not be included in the World Cup
 is farmet main zyada se zyada nipun khilaadiyon kii jarurat hoti he
 That is why we have reduced the number of teams from the upcoming World Cup to 10 but 16 teams can take part in Twenty20 World Cup instead of 12

 is faisle ke baad ab srilanka ko apana quarterfinal muqabla (yahaan tak pahunchane kii sthiti main) colombo main khelnaa hoga jabaki bangladesh ko dhaka main or bharat ko ahmedabad main khelnaa hoga
 If India stays in second place in Group B, then they will have to compete with the Group a third-order team
 bhartiya team agar apane group main shaamil sheersh-4 tiimon main se pehle sthaan par rahati he to bhi use ahmedabad main hi apana quarterfinal match khelnaa hoga

 If sleep will not get better, then the next morning is sure to be full of stress

 If work is done on them till late night, then even after going to bed, mindfulness remains active
 aise main acchhee neend ke liye jaruri aaraam nahin mil paata
 As a result, the body's battery is able to charge less through sleep
 research main yah salaah di gai ki aaj ke jamaane ke smart managers ko smartphone par apni nirbharta ko rachanaatmak dhang se tay karnaa hoga
 For example, at a given time of day, he should distance himself from the smartphone

 pichley dinon jeeyo kii dhamaakedaar lonching karne vaali reliance ne kaha he ki rojaanaa 10 karod kol drop kii samasya saamne aa rahi he
 Taking a dig at all the telecom operators across the country, Reliance said that they are not expressing their true intentions to solve the problem
 reliance ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha he ki jeeyo kii 80 fisadi se zyada kol fail ho ja rahi he
 However, the call drop problem is not just on Jio Network
 beete july main tri ne kaha tha ki zyaadaatar network 2 fisadi kol drop sunishchit karaane ke liye jaruri guidelins kaa ulanghan kar rahe hai
 Know, what is the problem of call drop and why there is a problem in calling
 
 
 kol drop kaa matlab he jab mobile par aapas main baat karne vaale do logon ke bich bina kaate hi baatcheet band ho jaae yaa duusari taraf se aawaaj hi nahin sunai detii he
 This happens due to technical reasons
 mobile network main kol drop hone kii ye mukhya vajahen hai:1
 Lack of radio coverage (either in downlink or in uplink) 2
 alag-alag sabsakribers ke bich radio vyavdhaan3
 Network not working properly
 For example, if you move from one place to another, you need to change bus / metro, if there is no direct bus / metro service
 isi tarah agar aap ek jagah se duusari jagah jate hai to aapke mobile network ko bhi apane radio channel badalane hote hai
 Even if the network does not get the right channel, there is a call drop problem
 4
 Call dropdown also depends on the quality of the hardware of the mobile handset
 5
 Apart from this, there is also a problem due to the open electrical wires in the vicinity
 6
 Dead spots: Mobile signals are very weak in some places
 inhen ded spots kaha jaataa he
 7
 signal baar-baar aane-jane yaa network jam hone kii vajah se bhi kol drop hota he
 8
 kol drop ke liye kabhi kabhi sim card bhi jimmedaar hote hai
 If the SIM card is scratched, dirty or bent, then there is a problem in the call
 reliance jeeyo ko isliye ho rahi dikkat1
 The Reliance Inter Connection Formula is not being decided
 tri ne kaha he kitelecom companiyonise aapas main sulajhaa len
 2
 iskaa samaadhaan he ki companiyaan 'point of interconect' den
 But there is a screw up on prices
 3
 TRAI believes that the government will have to intervene for inter connection
 airtel or anya jiesem network vaale operataron ko isliye ho rahi dikkat:1
 Telecom operators did not invest on a large scale as the number of users increased
 2
 Buildings are becoming more
 us hisaab se mobile tower nahin lag rahe
 3
 inbuilding solution nahin he
 4
 sabsakribers kii sankhya bad rahi he
 5
 ek hi tower main teen-teen janareshan baithe hai
 6
 4 ji aane kii vajah se 2 ji or 3 ji kii sevaayen prabhavit ho rahi hai
 Solution: 1
 toweralgane ke liye jagah kii kami ko dur karnaa hoga
 2
 companiyon ko majaboor karnaa padegaa ki wo network vistaar main nivesh karen
 3
 kis company ke paas kitne sabsakribar hai, iskaa detail rakhana hoga
 4
 in-building solution par dhyaan dena hoga
 However, turning these measures into reality is not so easy
 isliye kol drop kii samasya to bhavishya main bani hi rahegi

 After the death of Ramesh Kumar, there was a severe financial crisis in front of the family
 bacchon kii shiksha jari rakhane va parivaar paalane kaa sankat seemaa devi ke saamne aa gaya tha
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal changed the policy for the better future of the family

 Shortly after his death, the family faced an economic crisis
 bacchon kii shiksha ko jari rakhana bhi unki patni seemaa devi ke liye kathin ho gaya tha
 After this, various journalists approached Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to give them financial assistance
 unhone patrkaar ko aarthik sahaayta ke liye maujuud nitiyon kii jaankaree lee
 In which it was found that there are provisions for very minor financial assistance for journalists
 iske baad mukhyamantri ne vyaktigat prayaas kar niti main badlaav kiya
 After this, the way of giving financial assistance of one million rupees to the family of late Ramesh Kumar was cleared

 amitabh ne bataaya ki ab ve sirf 35 fisadi liver ke sahare hi jinda hai
 According to the decision of the Allahabad High Court at the disputed site of the Ramjanmabhoomi Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the Nirmohi Akhara, which owns one-third, has said that it will give full support to the other party 'ramlala Virajaman' for the construction of a grand temple on the Ramjanmabhoomi
 is ready
 nirmohi akhaade ke mahant bhaskar das ne kaha, 'mandir nirmaan ke liye aam sahmati or sahyog ke liye ramajanm bhoomi nyaas ke varisht sadsy ram vilaas vedanti ne unase baatcheet kii he
 Mahanta Das said that he has promised Vedanti that full support will be provided by the Akhara in the construction of the Ram temple, but the condition is that the Nirmohi Akhara will not cease to exist in whatever arrangement is made for the construction of the temple
 needed
 unhone kaha, 'ham kisi bhi surat main vivaadit sthal par masjid ke nirmaan ke paksh main nahin hai, yadi muslim vakf board ucch nyaayalay ke nirnay ko sarvocch nyaayalay main chunauti detaa he, to ham (akhaada or ramalala virajman) donon milakar mukadmaa ladenge
 Describing the conversation as amicable and positive, Vedanti said that Mahant Bhaskar Das also said that 67 acres of land acquired by the central government in and around the disputed site is all of Ramlalla and we asked the central government to construct the Ram temple
 Will demand to be given for mahant bhaskar das ne bataaya ki yah baatcheet kii shuruyaat he or aage baatcheet karke nirnay liya jaayegaa
 Vedanti said that Mahant Bhaskar Das argues that when the court has dismissed the case of the Sunni Waqf Board, it is justified to give a third of the land
 aapasi sahmati ke liye mahant gyaan das or babari masjid ke pakshakaar hashim ansaari ke bich hui baatcheet ke bare puche jane par mahant bhaskar das ne kaha, 'ham ramajanm bhoomi parisar ke aas paas kisi masjid ke nirmaan ke liye taiyaar nahi hai
 If it is made elsewhere then it is made
 'is sambandh main vedanti ne kaha, 'hashim ansaari ayodhya ke santon se ladanaa nahin chaahate or ve ab is vivaad ko yahi samaapt kar dena chaahate hai or yah raay saarvajanik bhi kar chuke he
 'he said that if everyone accepts Hashim Ansari, there will never be any dispute between Hindu Muslims in the country
 yah puche jane par ki kya ansaari ke saath unki bhi baat hui, vedanti ne kaha ki unki baat mahant gyaan das se chal rahi he
 It is noteworthy that in the Ayodhya case, the Allahabad High Court has decided to divide the disputed site into three equal parts between the Nirmohi Akhara, Ramlala Virajaman and the Sunni Waqf Board, but the condition is that the statue of Ramlala Virajaman is installed where it is today

 com / mayjvonboy The issue of banning his travel by all airlines was raised in Parliament on Monday after Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad misbehaved with an Air India official
 gaekwad kaa bachaav karte hue shivasena saansad anand raav adsul ne kapil sharma kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki nashe main dhutt kapil sharma hawaii yatra kar sakate hai, unke maamle main keval jaanch kii ja rahi he koi pabandi nahin lagaai gai he
 He demanded from the government that the matter be investigated seriously
 yatra par sabhi airlines dwaara pratibandh lagane or adhikari ke saath kathith rduvyavahaar ko lekar sabhi airlines dwaara un par pratibandh lagaae jane ke maamle main nagar vimaanan mantri ashok gajpati raju ne aaj loksabhaa main kaha ki unhone sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha ki ek saansad aise maamle main ghirenge
 He also said that no compromise can be made with the safety of airlines
 gajpati raju ne saath hi kaha ki dijisie (nagar vimaanan mahanideshaalay) ke niyam airlines kii suraksha ko sarvocch praathamikta par rakhte hai or kisi bhi prakaar kii hinsa airlines ke liye bheeshan aapadaa ho sakati he
 He said that DGCA has the right to prevent any passenger from flying if the behavior is not regulated
 gajpati raju ne kaha, ‘‘ek saansad bhi ek yatri he or kisi bhi yatri se alag shrenee ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav nahin kiya jaataa he
 He said that the action taken by the airlines was taken in view of the security and there can be no compromise on the safety of the airlines
 haalanki shivasena saansad anand raav adsul mantri ke is jawaab se santusht nahin hue or anya sadasyon ke saath asana ke saamne aa gaye
 When Speaker Sumitra Mahajan said that he was supporting the wrong thing and the minister had answered his question
 adhyaksh ne adsul or anya shivasena saansadon ko vimaanan mantri se baat kar maamla sulajhane kii baat kahi to sabhi saansad apane apane sthaan par chale gaye or adsul vimaanan mantri se baat karne lage
 After a while all Shiv Sena mps got up from the House, though they did not announce the walkout
 isse pehle shoonyakaal main anand raav adsul ne yah mudda uthaate hue kaha ki gaekwad ke saath bijness class main koi vivaad hua or airlines ke adhikari ne unke saath budtamiji kii
 He said, "I believe that it was a mistake to kill the officer
" isamen exiaar bhi darj hui he

 rabi kii buaai ke liye khet taiyaar hai or kisaan beej or khaad kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 The farmer has become helpless due to the closure of old notes
 uske paas nae note nahin hai, lihaaja vah khaad or beej nahin laa paa rahaa, jisase khet khaali pade hai
 To investigate this problem of farmers, when we reached Banaras, the farmer Jwala Prasad, who came out of his field after preparing the paddy crop for sowing of Rabi, was seen draining it with a heavy heart
 jwaala prasad ne rabi kii fasal kii buaai ke liye paanch dfa khet kii jutai ke baad pani lagaaya
 After it dried up, after plowing the field three times, when engaged in the jugaad of bringing seeds and manure to prepare for sowing, there was a sudden news of note closure
 lihaaja ghar main puraane note hone ke baavjood bhi beej khaad nahin laa paae or khet khaali rah gaya
 When we asked Jwala Prasad that why the fields were empty, he said as soon as he left, 'neither manure nor seed is there, there is no new note, no one is giving it, we are ready to cultivate 2 bigha fields, no seeds
 Do it is a big problem
 puraane note band hone se rabi kii fasal kii buaai kaa asar sirf kisaanon par hi nahin khetihar mazdooron par bhi pad rahaa he
 Next to Jwala Prasad's house was Chanrama Devi, who was beating paddy with Ram Dhani
 chanarma or unka parivaar khetihar majdoor hai
 At this time, it is their time to earn from the Rabi crop, but if there is no sowing in the fields, then they are doing the work of beating the paddy, but the sadness is that if the sowing stopped like this then the effect of their own stove May fall on tippaniyan Asked by Chanrama Devi that this is the wages of us
 yahi kaam nahin hoga to kya hoga
 There is a problem due to the closure of the note and farmers are also having trouble due to the limit of getting new notes
 40 bigha ke kastkaar jwaala prasad bataate hai ki ek bighas main genhu kii buaai ke liye 1 bori diapi 1 hazaar 50 kii, 1 bori potas 800 rupee kii 1 bori uria 350 kii yani total 2200 rupee khaad kaa kharch, phirgehun kaa beej 1 bighas main 40 kilo lagata he, jo 32 rupee kilo he yani 32 x 40 : 1280 rupee
 8 times 4000 from field preparation to sowing
 iske saath hi mazdooree or dawa par 1500 kaa kharch aata he, yani 1 bighas khet main taqariban 9000 rupee kaa kharch aata he
 If we are planting wheat in a 5 bigha field, then we need 45000 thousand rupees whereas we can extract only 4500 hundred rupees
 or ve bhi mil nahin paa rahe
 Rabi crop mainly consists of wheat, peas, mustard, barley, gram, Mussoorie, potato
 iske beej ke vitaran ke liye sarkaar ne vyavastha kii he
 Seeds were cultivated accordingly, in the Vidyapeeth block of Banaras, about 9700 ha
 centre ke godaam main beej kii bori bhari hui he par khariddaar kisaan nahin he
 500 quintal wheat seed came to this center
 note bandi se pehle 276 quintal bik gaya tha, lekin uske baad maal nahin bika
 These people are also unable to ask for the seeds because the Treasury is not taking old notes
 kisaanon kii is pareshaani kii padtaal karne ke liye jab ham banaras pahunche to dhan kii fasal baad rabi kii buaai ke liye taiyaar kar chuke apane khet main nikal ai ghaas ko kisaan jwaala prasad baari man se nikaalte dikhe
 Jwala Prasad planted water after plowing the field five times for sowing the rabi crop
 uske suukh jane ke baad phir teen baar khet ko jot kar jab buaai kii taiyaari karne ke liye beej or khaad laane ke jugad main lage to achaanak note bandi kii khabar aa gai
 So, despite having old notes in the house, the seeds could not bring manure and the field remained empty
 jwaala prasad se jab hamane poocha ki khet khaali kyon hai to chhutate hi bole 'na to khaad ba na to beej ba, kahin nayaa note nahin he, kahin koi de nahin rahaa, ham 2 bigha khet jot kar taiyaar hai, beej nahin he kya karen, badi pareshaani he
 The sowing of the Rabi crop due to the closure of old notes is affecting not only the farmers but also the agricultural laborers
 jwaala prasad ke ghar ke bagal ram dhani ke yahaan dhan peet rahi chanarma devi najar ain
 Chanrama and his family are agricultural laborers
 is samay unka rabi kii fasal se aamadani kaa samay he, lekin kahin kheton main buaai nahin ho rahi he to dhan peetane kaa kaam mila usee ko kar rahi hai, par dukh is baat kaa he agar aise hi buaai rukii rahi to asar unke apane chuulhe par pad saktaa he
 The comments chanarma devi se poochne par kaha ki yahi ham logon kii mazdooree he
 What will happen if this does not work? note ke band hone se to pareshaani to he hi or jo nae note milane kii limit he usase bhi kisaanon ko pareshaani ho rahi he

 agar 5 bigha khet main ham gehun laga rahe hai to hamen 45000 hazaar rupee chahie jabaki ham 4500 sau rupee hi nikaal sakate he
 And they are also unable to meet

 The center's warehouse is full of sacks of seeds but the buyer is not a farmer
 is centre main 500 quintal gehun kaa beej aayaa
 The note was sold 276 quintals before the closure, but did not sell after that
 ye log bhi beej bhi nahin manga paa rahe hai kyonki tregeri puraane note nahin le rahaa he

 Post from RICOH THETA
 - Spherical Image - RICOH THETA The most revered Gurudwara of Sikhs, the Golden Temple in Amritsar
 
 
 50 acre main failaa yah gurudwara aisi shanti or sukun pradaan karata he, jise aap yahaan se lautne ke baad bhi bhula nahin sakate
 
 
 Watch this 360 degree video of the prayer time happening near the lake (or Amritkund) in the evening, and the specialty of this video is that you keep turning it, and looking at the beauty of the gurudwara from different angles
 
 
 lekin 430 saal puraane is gurudware ko, jo lakhon-karodon ke liye shanti, saahas or prerana bana rahaa he, ab madad kii darkaar he
 
 
 Due to the constant air pollution, the color of its walls and magnificent dome have faded
 
 
 swarnajtit deevaaren ek sadi se bhi zyaada vakt pehle badali gai thim, or phir unhen varsh 1999 main badla gaya
 
 
 Despite the recent campaign to reduce pollution in the area, there has been no improvement in the situation, and no pollution monitoring equipment has been installed in the area
 
 
 amritsar ke agrani paryaavarnavid gunbir singh ne bataaya ki iaiti-dilli ke vichaaron ke alaava kai adhyayanon main paaya gaya ki "yahaan particulet matter (chote kan) tathaa anya pradooshak tatwon kii maatra us maatra se do se teen guna adhik he, jisaki anumati he
 
 
 So, air pollution is playing a big role in reducing the brightness of the Golden Temple
 
 
 " Just a few feet away from the main road leading to the temple, there are such huge piles of garbage which cannot be ignored

 medical ke dauraan peedita ko chakkar aane or kamajori kii shikaayat hui
 a few weeks ago i got a call from a former student, who had recently completed his phd in Mathematics from the US
 vah bahut khush lag rahaa tha
 Her famous Houston M
 in Texas
 di
 The first job of a research scientist was at Anderson Cancer Center
 isamen koi ajubi baat nahin he
 Likewise, two years ago, another former student called me happy when she got her first job at the prestigious John Hapkins University School of Medicine after doing her phd in Mathematics
 main yah mahasoos karne laga hum ki duniya ab un yuva pratibhaaon kaa swaagat karne lagi he, jinke paas ganit ke vishay main koi acchhee yogyata he
 Similarly, another young man with a phd in mathematics is doing a good job in a London financial company
 usee se milti-julati prishthbhumi vaale do or chaatr mumbai main ek badi bahurashtriya data analytics company main acha kaam kar rahe hai
 a friend from my college days in Delhi, who had a degree in Mathematics, is currently a Distinguished Professor of Economics at one of the most prestigious universities in the world
 in sabhi ke bich ek ajeeb samanta yah he ki inamen se kaiyon ko ejineering kii companiyon main aakarshak naukariyon kaa prastaav bhi mila tha or ye sabhi acchhee tarah jaanate the ki unhen shiksha ke kshetra main bhi naukariyaan mil sakati thim
 However, a phd in mathematics is not necessary to be successful
 main jo baat kahana chahta hum, vah yah he ki ganit main buniyadi training bhi aapako badi safalataa dilaa sakati he
 To test this, i obtained information about three-year-old students who were successful in CAT (CAT) examination from a particular college in Delhi
 maine paaya ki sabase zyada sankhya main safal chaatro ke paas ganit ke vishay main undergraduate degree thi
 The founder of a large IT company once told me that students who had at least an undergraduate degree in mathematics and who were trained in coding, did more than engineering students in their company and elsewhere
 Had a good success
 kai baar sarvshereshth koding systamon kaa avishkaar ganit ke buniyadi siddhanton ke istemaal se hi ho jaataa he or acchhee koding va unki khoj karne vaale—jaise ki aresae algoridm ke liye—naukari ke maamle main jabardast safalataa hasil kar lete hai
 Today, the creative engineers or medical researchers sitting at the best places in the world have been mathematics students who specialize in coding
 ganit kii buniyadi jaankaree bhi bade kaam kii hoti he or aaj kii duniya main lagaataar uskaa mahatv badhata ja rahaa he
 Now the question is, how does mathematics prove to be beneficial? iske kai kaaran hai
 First, mathematics is used in almost all areas and activities of man and is inherent in nature
 isliye jo log ganit main yogyata rakhte hai, ve chizon ko samajhane main iskaa istemaal kisi lens kii tarah karte hai or ise upyogi bana dete hai
 In addition, the study of mathematics makes people logical and they analyze data very efficiently
 jaahir he, koding main iskaa puraa phayda miltaa he
 These are very useful qualifications
 main yahaan yah bhi bataanaa chaahunga ki ganit vyaavhaarik duniya main bhi bahut kaam kii cheez he
 i did a comparative study of a big Indian IT company and Google, looking at their earnings in a given year
 haalanki bhartiya ity company google ke mukaable kahin zyada puraani thi or usamen kahin zyada karmchaaree the, lekin puure saal kii uski kamai google kii sirf ek timahi kii kamai se bhi kam thi
 The reason for this is that Google has the power of mathematical ideas, which is due to the students of Stanford University, whereas this is not the case with the Indian IT company
 yah fark samajhnaa bahut jaruri he
 Hence math can bring you great success in life
 aaj jab nai khoj or navachaar par jor he to ganit sabase kaam kaa he

 Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had invited all mlas and ministers of the opposition and opposition to his house for dinner party
 isamen se parivaar samet 160 vidhayak ashok gahalot ke ghar khaanaa khaane pahunche
 In fact, in Rajasthan, it was a tradition that if the state budget was passed in the assembly, the Chief Minister used to invite mlas of all parties to dinner at his house, including the family, but Vasundhara Raje stopped this custom after becoming the Chief Minister
 mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne ek baar phir se ise shuru kiya he
 The Congress has come into a cautious mode these days due to the activism of the BJP in Karnataka and Goa
 jahaan ek ore madhya pradesh main mukhyamantri kamalnath ne sarkaar bachaae rakhane kii kavayad shuru kar di he, vahiin ashok gahalot bhi bachaav mod main aa gaye hai
 In the changed political environment, it is believed that this step is more of a dinner diplomacy than Ashok Gehlot's tradition
 jis tarah se baaten kii ja rahi he ki rajasthan main bijepi congress sarkaar ko gira sakati he
 In such a situation, it is necessary for Ashok Gehlot to keep the opposition mlas also close
 rajasthan congress main do bhi do gut hai
 One faction is in support of Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot while the other is in support of Ashok Gehlot
 aise main ashok gahalot ke liye up mukhyamantri sachin payalat ke kheme par bhi najar rakhana jaruri he
 Therefore, time was also requested to revive this tradition
 is party main sarkaar ke afasaron ko bhi bulaayaa gaya tha jisase kisi mantri yaa vidhayak ko koi kaam ho to sidhe baat kar le
 In this party of Ashok Gehlot, 93 out of 100 Congress mlas, including Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, arrived
 jabaki kul 160 vidhayak or mantri apane parivaar ke saath pahunche the
 Ashok Gehlot was seen meeting with the leaders of the opposition and his family
 bijepi kii taraf se vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh gulabchand kataaria bhi apane parivaar ke saath pahunche the
 On this occasion, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot told the leaders of the opposition that there has been bitterness in the ruling and opposition in Rajasthan for some years
 yah thik nahin he
 It has been a tradition since the times of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, despite all the political opposition, we live like family among ourselves

 jabaki police khud dilli mahila ayog ke notice ke baad harakat main ai or aaropee ko giraftaar kiya
 'the rape victim's name has already been sparred earlier
 Debates also questioned the concealment of the rape victim's name, why should the rape victim hide her identity? Shouldn't a rapist hide himself? Should the victim be ashamed that she has been the victim of torture? This statement of Swati Maliwal can once again give rise to controversy

 Do not force parents to buy separate books
 is tarah ke nirdesh to rajasthan ke shiksha mantri ne bhi jari kiye hai
 Now the question is that those who have been forced to buy things at a higher price, will their money be refunded? Those who have been asked to buy 2000 shoes instead of 800, will they be back? Does CBSE even have a mechanism to monitor all schools or do we just keep hoping? camel didi pahalu khan kii hatya ke aarope main band yuvakon se milane alvar pahunchin
 Kamal Didi has called the murder accused Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev of today
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki koi shahid kaa apmaan kar de to camel didi use maaf nahin karengi lekin ek aaropee ko shahid bhagat singh or sukhdev bataakar unhone kiskaa kad badha diya he, kiskaa apmaan kiya he, yah aap dyside kiijie
 In such a way, now Bhagat Singh will also have to ask whether it is me or some other Bhagat Singh
 didi tamaam gau bhakton ko lekar andolan karne vaali hai
 By the way, the accused should be considered as accused, not the accused
 duusari taraf jisaki hatya hui he uskaa saath dene kii jagah mev netaa gaayab ho chuke hai

 Have taken peace march in Alwar and are going to do it on 21 April
 kendriya vidyalayon main shikshakon ke 10,000 pad khaali hai
 If we increase the amount of debit on hindu-muslim topics on TV, then there will be no need to ask that if there are so many posts vacant then how will studies be done? What would be the condition of unemployment due to their not being filled
 mujhe pataa he ki main kuch zyada bol rahaa hum lekin aapako hairaani nahin hoti ki har duusare din tivi par hindu-musalmaan taapic kahaan se aa jaataa he
 There are 10,039 vacancies of teachers in Kendriya Vidyalayas

 a school in Orissa does not provide any receipt for re-admission, ie black money
 rudki kaa ek skool sabhi bacchon se har din hand sanitiser lekar aane ko kahata he
 In a school in Mathura, Rs 550 is charged in the name of e-service, for email and SMS
 khetri nagar rajasthan kaa ek skool diary ke liye 700 rupee le rahaa he
 The school in Aligarh refused to accept the fees in cash, but took advanced checks for four quarters
 gudgaanv ke ek skool ne 40 fisadi or lakhanu ke ek skool ne 60 fisadi fees badha di he
 300 to 500 rupees were taken from students at a school in Ludhiana during the floods of Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, Nepal earthquake
 chaatro ko chande kii koi raseed nahin di gai
 a school in Ahmedabad charges fees in the name of extra activity but does not have a play ground
 yah sab darshakon ke bheje gaye email se pataa chalaa he
 His experiences are documented
 hamane skool se check nahin kiya, in sabake paas rata rataya jawaab hota he
 Complaints have come from schools of leaders of every party
 ek baat samajni hogi
 Schools require money to run
 fees vaazib bhi badhaai ja sakati he magar 60 pratishat se lekar 100 fisadi fees vruddhi kii baat samaj nahin aati
 Parents' earnings do not increase that much
 dilli, mumbai yaa anya shaharon ke pratishthit skulon kii fees to samaj aati he magar maine jo email padhe hai uske aadhaar par kah saktaa hum ki garib ilaakon main bhi skool vahi fees vasuul rahe hai jo bade shaharon ke bade skool vasuulate hai

 Schools deposit Rs 15,200 from their current account to a teacher's account

 Then the school gives a salary of 4000 or 5000 rupees in cash
 jo awaz uthaata he usase kaha jaataa he ki aap naukari chhod do
 In my opinion, do not celebrate Teachers' Day this year
 gulam kii tarah aapke shikshakon ke saath vyavhaar ho rahaa he or ham shikshak diwas ke maukey par lacture dete hai
 Surprisingly, there is another matter
 bahut kam shikshakon ne email kiye hai

 At Mumbai's Azad Maidan, some parents have started a hunger strike against the government
 unka kahana he ki mumbai ke saat skulon ne bina abhibhavakon kii sahmati ke fees badha di jo maharashtra skool fees regulation act kaa ulanghan he
 In the mid-day of April 18, the statement of Maharashtra Education Minister Vinod Tawde has been published that schools with CBSE and ICSE board do not come under the state government, under the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, so why are the parents blaming us for increasing fees Huh
 unka yah bayaan kai akhabaaron main chapa he

Does CBSE even have a mechanism to monitor all schools or do we just keep hoping? kangana ranot ke talent kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki vah shabana azmi ke baad duusare number kii actress hai jinhen lagaataar do rashtriya film puraskaar mili hai
 But these days he is not only in the discussion about this award nor the shooting of 'rangoon'
 apane bebaak bayanon ke liye jaani jane vaali is actress ke pichley dinon liye gaye kadam par sabhi hairaan hai
 Some are supporting silently, while others are putting up with allegations
 baat ho rahi he 'beete rishte' ko lekar rithik roshan ke saath unki kanoonee ladaai kii or isi bich unke ek eks dwaara yah khulaasa karne kii ki vahakaala jadookrti hai
 In a special conversation with India Today, Kangana said a lot and what she said really enhanced the beauty of her beautiful personality
 - aap apane papa se jhagad kar is line main ai thim
 So it would be a different pleasure to win three National Awards
 maine hameshaa dil kii suni he
 Trusted in his hard work and his intention
 papa ne saath nahin diya to ek tareeke se mere liye sahi hi rahaa
 This increased the courage to do something
 - queen to royal hoti he or ham hameshaa raniyon ko ek daayre se dekhte hai
 But you are breaking stereotypes
 
 
 maine apane dil kii suni he jo mujhe sahi laga, maine kiya
 My father would be right in his place and i took my own life decisions
 yah sahi hai ki main dusron ke bataae raste par nahin chali magar meraa rule todane kaa matlab dusron ko galat sabit karnaa nahin, khud ko sahi sabit karnaa tha
 Do you also plan to go to Hollywood? 
 
 main chaahati hum ki duusari jagah bhi filmein karun
 The scope of the audience watching me increased
 lekin hollywood khud duusari jagah market talash rahaa he
 So what can i expect from there? vahiin china or bollywood kii filmein apni jagah bana rahi hai
 In such a situation, i would like to do films with international appeal instead of Hollywood
 - aapane khan tikdi ke saath abhi tak ek bhi film nahin kii he
 
 
 When i really needed a super break, i did not get offers to work with these superstars
 or ab jab ofer milte hai tomain apane hisaab se filmein karnaa chaahati hum
 What is the point of doing a film for just a few scenes? - industry main aap bade hiroj ke baraabar paisa maangati hai
 
 
 When i am giving all the time and hard work to a film, then why do not i demand a fee equal to the hero
 main to nahin kahati ki mujhe bade khan jitna paisa miltaa he lekin haa, kai mail actors ke baraabar yaa unki jitani fees main leti hum
 You have become the 'face of Feminism' of Bollywood
 
 
 main artist hum or mere paas jaise role aaenge, main karuungi
 Films like 'queen' are personal agendas and what i am doing is all for my career
 isliye main aisa koi credit nahin lenaa chaahati
 - You have admitted in an interview that you have lived in such relationships in which you could reach the mouth of death
 
 
 mujhe kisi baat kii shame nahin he or mere paas chhipaane ko bhi kuch nahin he
 i can be called blunt but i am one of the most outspoken
 - mail actors kya aapse ghabaraate hai
 
 
 The atmosphere in our place is such that women are suppressed
 mere ghar ko hi len
 i remember once when my grandfather picked me up from the dining table and said that the ladies eat later
 ab iskaa kya kar sakate hai
 - But you are being openly called black-magic
 
 
 inase main bhi hairaan hum
 All this shows another face of society
 yah negative mindset dikhaata he
 i have been given tags like Psychopath, Blood Drinker, Witch
 meraa sawaal he ki kisi kii sichuation ko aap us par aarope kii tarah kyon thope rahe hai
 Women have been pressed against similar charges
 hameshaa hi
 Then why words like witch, witch are taken negatively
 kya ham harry potter ko nahin dekhte
 The rest, where i am concerned, i have no problem reading articles on my period cycle in Gossip columns
 - aise aaropon se kya dukh nahin hota
 
 
 it happens
 main bhi ruk kar sochati hum to mujhe bhi jhatka lagata he
 Then i cannot say sorry to anyone when i have not done anything wrong
 - agar koi purush saathi acha kaam nahin kar paa rahaa hota he to iskaarope mahilaon paralagata he
 The example of anushka-virat is before us
 
 
 meri bahan par jab acid atake hua to usase pehle main in mudde par gambhir nahin thi
 But when this happens to you, then you start opening your eyes to the things of society
 lekin iske peeche bhi kahin na kahin yahi soch he ki main tumhen paa nahin saktaa yaa tumko dabaa nahin saktaa to tumko barbaad kar duungaa
 i am with people who are struggling with drug addiction
 maine aise role kiye hai
 Why do we think negatively for such people
 kyon ham unako samaaj se kaatane kii sochate hai
 
 
 - No one is with you, did you feel bad about it? i have some well wishers in Bollywood who have always encouraged me
 phir soshal media se bhi saport mila he
 Want to see how this dispute ends
 
 
 ab jab sab khulkar saamne aa gaya he to thik he
 i have seen that older people are more showy and false
 main galat nahin hunto sori nahin kahuungi
 But sometimes all of this hurts and weeps
 lekin is sabakaa saamana to karnaa hi he
 Has strengthened itself
 main logon par jaldi vishwaas kar leti hum
 But still she does not want to change herself

 In the last few years, claims have been made of a thick relationship between India and the US, but now a decision by the US President Donald Trump has raised questions on these claims
 darasal, america raashtrapati trump ne bharat ke saath GSP (janerlined system of prefrence) samaapt karne kaa faisla kiya he
 The GSP termination means that the product that India will sell in the US will now be taxed by the government there
 ab tak bharat bina tex ke kuch product kaa niryaat karata he
 America's move is being considered a major setback in terms of bilateral relations
 kab hui thi GSP kii shuruacamerica ne GSP kii shuruyaat 1976 main kii thi
 The aim was to increase economic growth in developing countries
 iske tahat chuninda items ke duty-free yaa maamuli tarriff par duusare deshon ko america main niryaat kii anumati di jaati he
 Currently, 129 countries including India are benefiting from GSP
 bharat ke chemicals or engeering jaise sectoron ke kareeb 1800 se zyada chote-bade product par GSP kaa phayda miltaa he
 That is, these products from the Indian market reach the US market without any tax or nominal duty charge
 jaahir si baat he ki in product par ab tex lagaana bharat ke liye ek jhatka he
 Explain that India is 5 under US GSP
 6 arab dollar (kareeb 40 hajaar karod rupee) ke saamaanon kaa niryaat karata he
 Why America took the decision: US President Donald Trump says that there is no confidence from India that it will give equal discount to American products in its market
 america kaa kahana he ki bharat main paabandiyon kii vajah se use vyapaarik nuksaan ho rahaa he
 He said that American products that go to India are charged at a very high rate
 america kii harley-davidson motorcycle kaa udhaaharan dete hue trump ne kaha, ‘‘jab ham bharat ko motorcycle bhejte hai to us par vahaan 100 fisadi kaa shulk lagaaya jaataa he
 They charge us 100 per cent, while India sends us motorcycles, then we do not charge them anything
 ’’ america kanoon ke mutabik yah badlaav notification jari hone ke 2 maheene baad lagu ho paaenge
 What is the government saying, however, a top government official said that this decision will not have much impact on India's exports to the US
 vaanijya sachiv anup vadhavan ne kaha ki bharat jiespi ke tahat america ko 5
 Exports goods worth $ 6 billion (about Rs 39,645 crore)
 inamen se sirf 1
 Only $ 90 million worth of products fall into the no-charge category
 anya product par maamuli shulk liya jaataa he
 He said that India mainly exports intermediate goods like raw materials and biochemical to the US
 bataa den ki bharat kaa america ko niryaat vahaan se hone vaale aayaat se zyada he
 Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won the Democratic presidential nominee's war on Monday

 Additional support of Superdelegate: Hillary Kosuparadelegate also received additional support after a strong performance in Puerto Rico on Sunday
 is tarah 68 saal kii hillari ummidavaar banane kii disha main sheersh par pahunch gayi
 According to the information, Hillary has the support of 1812 plaged delegates and 572 super delegates
 ummidavaari paane ke liye jaruri sankhya se zyada votis tarah unke paas kul 2384 pratinidhi hai
 This number is one more than the number required to get candidature
 super dailygat ve pratinidhi hote hai jinhen kanvension main shaamil hokar yah bataate kaa adhikaar hota he ki ve kise ummidavaar ke rup main chaahate hai
 They also have the right to decide who to make a candidate in the event of not getting majority for the candidature of the party
 abhi or badhane vaale hai hillari ke votplaced dailygat ve hote hai jinhen rajya yaa sthaneey str par chunaa jaataa he
 He casts his vote in favor of his predetermined candidate at the National Conference of the Democratic Party
 hillari ke samarthak pratinidhiyon kii sankhyamangalvarko tab or badhegi jab adhik pratinidhi vaale california or new jersey sahit chah rajyon main muqabla hoga
 Hillary spoke: Struggling for every vote Hillary said Monday night in Long Beach, California, that her focus is still on the states, where voters will cast their votes on Tuesday
 unhone kaha ki ham log ek aitihaasik or anokhe kshan ke kareeb hai, lekin hamaare paas ab bhi kaam karne hai, kya nahin karne hai? unhone kaha ki mangalvaar hamaare chah chunaav hai or ham yahaan california sahit harek vot ke liye kadaa sangharsh karne ja rahe hai
 Donald Trump is likely to face former First Lady of America, Senator from New York, and former Secretary of State to officially become Democratic Party candidate next month
 vah republican party ke sambhavit ummidavaaradonald trampase aam chunaav main muqabla karengi
 a recent opinion poll has revealed that Hillary is one of the most unpopular candidates as Trump
 bataur videsh mantri aaropon se ghir chuki hai hillaribator videsh mantri nijee email sarwar ke istemaal ke maamle se jude vivaad ne hillari kii paardarshita or unki eemaandaaree par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 People in the Republican Party believe that Hillary's foreign policy record as foreign minister has been poor in dealing with Libya and Russia
 isse unke ummidavaar ko bada laabh pahunch saktaa he
 Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan said on Wednesday that the central bank is fully prepared to deal with the fluctuations in the Indian market due to the policy move of the US Federal Reserve on the interest rate
 aisi sambhaavna he ki fedral rigerv byaaj dar main vruddhi kaa sanket de saktaa he, kyonki america arthvyavastha main sudhaar kaa sanket dikh rahaa he
 As a result, capital can emerge from emerging markets, including India
 vitt mantri arun jetali ke saath mulaakaat ke baad rajan ne kaha, ‘‘agar fedral rigerv byaaj dar badhaata he to share or mudra bazaar main utaar chadhaav aa saktaa he
 But even if there are ups and downs, then the normalcy in the market will be restored

 Your opinion is important
 jab aap chaar tej gendbaajon ke saath khelte hai to yah ranneeti kehalaati he

 'dhoni ne kaha, 'aakraamak fielding kaa daur khatm ho gaya he
 The kind of cricket that we used to play has completely changed
 jahaan, praaia: ham dekhte the ki midon par khilaadi khadaa karnaa ek aam baat thi
 But now the player is rarely seen at midon
 dilli test ke dauraan maidan main outfield or ballebaajon ke kareeb kaaphi khilaadiyon ko khadaa kiya gaya tha
 It has become a standard
 khilaadiyon kii manodasha ko dekhte hue fielding main kaaphi badlaav kiye jate hai
 'dhoni gave an example of the same kind of fielding by two captains, saying,' This strategy is called if you put players on Deep Thirdman, Deep Point, Deep Scaver leg for Virender Sehwag
 lekin jab dhoni, david warner ke liye deep point or deep scaver leg par khilaadi khadaa karte hai to yah rakshaatmak ho jaataa he

 On the morning of 6 June, the clock needles were at 5
57 pm
 tabhi sarkaar ke press soochna beuro yani PIB ne ek patr jari kiya
 Which referred to the formation of eight cabinet committees in the Modi government
 jab yah relies jari hui, us vakt tak modi sarkaar ke zyaadaatar mantri sokar bhi nahin uthe the yaa jo uthe bhi the ve morning walk par rahe honge
 But after the information became public, there was a stir on social media from the Lutyens zone since morning
 darasal, nitigat faislon ke liye cabinet cametiyon kaa gathan hota he
 Which minister is included in how many cabinet committees, it shows his stature in the government
 aath main se sirf do cabinet cametiyon main rajnath singh kii maujuudagi par party hi nahin baahar bhi khusar-fusar shuru ho gai
 Modi government 2
 0 main rajnath kaa kad ghatane-badhane ko lekar charchaa hone lagi
 According to a party source, since Rajnath Singh was the national president of the BJP
 vah sansadeey or raajnneetik maamalon ke morchon par kai baar party ke liye sankatmochak (troubleshooter) bhi rahe hai
 In the previous government, in this context, he was placed in the Committee on Political Affairs
 vahiin pichhali baar raksha mantri rahete nirmala sitaraman or manohar parrikar ko bhi raajnneetik maamalon kii cabinet cametiyon main jagah mili thi
 In such a situation, there was speculation about Rajnath Singh staying out of these two important committees
 PIB se 6 june ko subah 5:57 minute par jari hui thi cabinet cametiyon ke gathan kii reliseshuru hua damege controlsoshal media se lekar menstream media me shuukravaar ko cabinet cametiyon kaa gathan surkhiyon main rahaa
 There was a lot of reaction when Rajnath Singh was out
 sirf do cametiyon main naam darj hone se rajnath singh ke samarthakon ke naaraaz hone kii bhi baaten kahi jane lageen
 According to party sources, there was already mild resentment among supporters for getting the post of Defense Minister in place of Home Minister
 magar baad main cabinet cametiyon main bhi bhoomika simit kiye jane se soshal media par tikhi pratikriyaayein dekhne ko milin
 The bjp's top leadership did not delay in sensing the severity of these reactions
 kaha yah bhi jaataa he ki bijepi or sangh ke bich samanvay kaa kaam karne vaali bhaiyyaji joshi kii cameti ne bhi is par najar rakhi
 If sources are to be believed, Ramlal, who represents the national general secretary (organization) association in the BJP, also kept an eye on the whole incident
 yahaan bataa den ki bijepi main rashtriya mahasachiv bhale kai hon, magar mahasachiv (sanghathan) kaa pad keval ek hota he, jo sangh se aae padaadhikari ko hi miltaa he
 The role of the General Secretary (organization) is to play a link between the BJP and the Sangh
 rajnath singh maamle main pratikriyaaon ko lekar bijepi ke sheersh netritv ne upi sahit kai rajyon ke sanghathan se feedback bhi jutaya
 Then an attempt to damage control started
 bijepi ko laga ki kahin isse party kaaryakartaaon main isse galat sandesh na jaae or virdohi dalon ke log ise mudda banaakar party par nishaanaa na saadhane kii koshish karen
 In such a situation, it was decided to place Rajnath Singh in important committees for his stature
 phir raat saadhe nau baje ke kareeb media main rajnath singh ko chaar or cametiyon main jagah dene kii soochna jari hui
 Rajnath is now home minister Amit Shah in all the eight cabinet committees constituted by the member committee of six members
 piem modi chah cametiyon main member hai
 While Nirmala Sitharaman is followed by Shah in the list of most committees, he is a member of seven committees
 rajnath singh ko raajnneetik or sansadeey maamalon kii alag-alag cabinet cametiyon ke saath nivesh or vikaas, rojgaar or kaushal vikaas kii bhi cabinet cameti main bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 Thus, he will now be involved in decisions related to six committees
 isse pehle rajnath singh ko jin do cametiyon main jagah mili thi
 One was the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) and the other was the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA)

 ab ye dekhnaa mjedaar hoga ki is hafte 26 july ko relies ho rahi film 'jajmental he kya' ke saamne ye donon filmein kitna tik paati hai
 Dara Singh, who won his talent in the field of wrestling and then in the acting world, was taken home on Wednesday night
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki oxigen na mil paane kii vajah se unke mastishk ko gaharaa nuksaan hua he jisaki vajah se unke thik hone kii ummid bahut hi kam he
 Singh was in a hospital in the city for the last four days
 unke putr bindu daara singh ne kaha, ‘vah ghar par hai
 Please do not follow
 jab vah antim saans lenge to main aapako bataa duungaa
 They are not expected to survive
 ’84 varshiya abhinayta ko saat july ko gambhir haalat main kokilaben aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 He had a heart attack and was in the ICU since then
 kokilaben aspataal ke sioo dow ram narayan ne kaha, ‘hamane unka emarai kiya or pataa chalaa ki jab unhen dil kaa daura padaa tha tab mastishk main oxigen kii aapurti baadhit hone kii vajah se unke mastishk ko gaharaa nuksaan hua he

 ' pravartan nideshaalay (idi) ke aankadon ke mutabik 8 november ko notebandi kii ghoshnaa ke baad deshbhar main pratibandhit hue 500 or 1000 rupee kii karency se jamkar sone kii kharidari kii gai
 During the whole month, gold was purchased with a restricted currency of 20 thousand crores
 puure desh se ekatrit kiye gaye aankadon ke mutabik november maheene main kul 66 ton sona emport kiya gaya he
 According to the country's Bullion Association, only 52-55 tonnes of gold was imported in November 2015, a year ago
 lihaaja november 2015 or november 2016 emport hue emport hue sone main 10-13 ton kaa antar he
 During 2015, the country imported 700 tonnes of gold
 lekin 2016 main net emport kii sankhya girakar 500-550 ton rahaa
 Understand these figures
 jaise hi pradhanmantri modi ne notebandi kii ghoshnaa kii, inakam tex department ko shikaayatein milane lagi ki desh main sona-chaandi (bullian) kaarobaari or jewalers 50,000 rupee main 10 gram sona bech rahe hai
 After this, the Income Tax Department started raiding bullion traders which caused a stir among bullion traders across the country
 bullian kaarobaariyon or jewalers ne apni dukaan kaa shater band kar diya, vaise bhi unka bullian stock khatm ho chukaa tha
 So the question is, when the bullion traders and jewelers had dropped their shutter, the business had come to a standstill, then why did they import such a large amount of gold during this month? Sources claim that about 10-15% of this 66 tonnes of imported gold went to the real buyers and the rest of the gold was purchased from black money in the country
 lihaaja apeksha se adhik kharida gaya sona desh main sirf kaledhan ko gold main canwart karne ke liye kharida gaya
 The most purchased Sonacendra government in Delhi is examining these import figures
 november ke dauraan kul 20,000 karod rupee kaa sona emport kiya gaya he(1 kilo sona- 30 lakh rupee)
 According to government figures, about 25 tonnes of this 66 tonnes of gold has been sold in Delhi
 baaki shahro main-15 ton ahmedabad7
 3 Ton Hyderabad 7 Ton Chennai 6
 2 ton bengaluru2
 5 tons Kolkata, and 1

 The 2019 Lok Sabha elections are over and the election is no less shocking for the Gandhi family
 congress ko 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii tulana main sirf 8 siton kii badhat hasil hui
 The number of Congress mps in the Lok Sabha now stands at 52, up from 44 in 2014
 khud party chif rahul gandhi smriti irani se amethi loksabhaa seat haar gaye, jo congress kaa garh mana jaataa tha
 However, Rahul won a landslide victory in Wayanad Lok Sabha seat in Kerala and got 706367 votes
 lekin kya ab rahul gandhi dobaaraa amethi se loksabhaa chunaav ladenge? agar itihaas ke pannon ko palatakar dekhen to indira gandhi ko raibareli se maat mili, uske baad unhone us kshetra kaa dobaaraa rukh nahin kiya
 Though his uncle Sanjay Gandhi lost to Amethi in 1977, but won again in 1980 and reached Parliament
 rahul gandhi kii daadi or purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne 1967 ke aam chunaavon main yahaan se jeet hasil kii
 After this, Indira Gandhi also won the 1971 elections
 saal 1975 main apatkaal kii ghoshnaa ke baad jab 1977 main chunaav hue to indira gandhi ko buree tarah maat mili
 Rajanarayana of the Janata Party defeated him with 55,202 votes

 1980 main indira gandhi ne dobaaraa dakshin kii seat chuni or intjaar khatm hua andhra pradesh kii madak loksabhaa seat (ab telugana) par
 Indira defeated Janata Party strongman s Jaipal Reddy here
 dilachasp baat he ki indira gandhi 1984 tak jab tak vah jinda raheen, dobaaraa raibareli kaa rukh nahin kiya or madak se hi saansad raheen
 In 1977, Sanjay Gandhi was defeated by Amethi seat by Ravindra Pratap Singh of Janata Party

 ' march 2014 main jab bijepi ne narendra modi ko uttar pradesh se chunaav ladaane ke bare main antim faisla nahin kiya tha tab bhi rajya ke prabharee party mahasachiv amit shah is bare main saaf the ki modi ko uttar pradesh ke purvi kshetra se hi chunaav laduya hoga
 He recommended it to the then party president Rajnath Singh
 khud ko uttar pradesh ke bade netaaon main ginaney vaale rajnath singh kuch khaas utsahit nahin the
 He questioned whether it would be okay for both the party president and the prime ministerial candidate to contest from the same state
 shah ne koi jawaab nahin diya or agle mudde par aa gaye
 When the meeting was over, Shah again requested that Rajnath Singh now consider his suggestion
 maamla jahaan kaa tahaan rahaa
 Rajnath Singh kept thinking and trying to find a middle ground, he considered Patna seat for Modi because Bihar was equally important
 lekin shah adatan is tarah ke samjhauton ke virdohi rahe hai
 Probably because of this quality along with his other key qualities, he is also a blessing to Modi
 shah ne bahut gahare adhyayan ke baad yah nateeja nikaala tha
 He believed that the only way in front of the BJP to create a wave of Modi in order to overcome the complex trap of caste and religion in Uttar Pradesh is to give it continuous air
 pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kii shah ke saath shah ne apana sujhav yaad dilaayaa or baar-baar yaad dilaate rahe
 In the end he accepted that his suggestion had been accepted and stained the next question — where does the president want to fight? Within a few weeks, this issue was raised head-on and now Rajnath Singh started flirting to decide his constituency
 kuch ghabrahat ke pal bhi aae jab aise suzav mili ki rajnath singh jharkhand se chunaav laden
 His advocates were quick and captured Lucknow in the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's legacy
 modi ko shah ke faislon par bharosa he or manjuuri milane ke baad kamyaabi paane ke liye din-raat ek karne ke unke gun kii ve prashansa karte hai
 Shah gave Uttar Pradesh to his boss
 bijepi or apana dal ke gathjod ne 80 main se record 73 siten jeet leen
 Now Shah's stature in the party was certain to increase
 modi unki ummidavaari ko aage badhaane main jute gaye
 There were protests within the party and some RSS leaders that both the Prime Minister and the party president could not be from Gujarat and Shah was also facing trial for killing people in fake encounters
 par modi ke is tark ke saamne kisi kii na chali ki bijepi jin rajyon ko jeetna chaahati he, kya vahaan jeet dilaane vaala koi adhik samarth netaa he?adhyaksh ji ke chahetimit shah 49 varsh kii umr main bijepi ke sabase yuva adhyaksh hai
 Along with his saddlery, the face of the party is expected to be young in the coming days
 kuch andruni logon kaa kahana he ki modi saaf taur par sochate hai ki party ko yuva matadaataaon ke saath rishta badhanaa chahie or haal kii safalataa ko majboot karnaa chahie
 But the youth organization is only one motive behind making Shah the new president of BJP
 unki niyukti ke tihare nihitarth hai
 One, he is Modi's closest aide and his appointment ends the Prime Minister's grip on the party, ending the supremacy of Delhi congregation leaders who leave the path despite not being successful in the 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 Were not ready duusare, shah kii niyukti se sanghathan ko un bujurg netaaon se chhutkaaraa dilaane kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he jinaki ab koi upyogita dikhaai nahin detii
 And third, most importantly, in Uttar Pradesh, Shah has proved that he is capable of implementing Modi's order even with the RSS
 unhone modi kii prabandhan style apanaai or sangh kii sanghathanaatmak kshamta kaa sahaara liya tathaa usamen badi chaturaai se technology kaa upyog kiya
 Two days before Shah was declared BJP President on July 9, senior Sangh pracharaks, 49-year-old Ram Madhav and 50-year-old Shiv Prakash were also inducted into the BJP
 shiv prakaash ne kshetra prachaarak ke rup main pashchimi uttar pradesh main shah ke saath kaam kiya he or ram madhav ek dashak tak aresas ke pravaktaa ke rup main media main chhaae rahe hai
 No definite role has been assigned to Ram Madhav yet, but he is present in every Shah meeting with party officials
 agle chah maah main jin chaar rajyon, jammu-kashmir, haryana, jharkhand or maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai, unki bijepi ikaayiyon ke saath praarambhik charchaa ke dauraan bhi madhav maujuud the
 Shah's goal is to have a BJP government in at least three of these states
 party assam, pashchim bengal, orissa, tamilnadu or kerala main mili abhootpurv badhat ko bhi apane haq main majboot karnaa chaahati he
 Uttar Pradesh BJP President Laxmikant Bajpayee says, "shah has not only the foresight but also the determination and ability to execute decisions quickly
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav 2017 main hone hai par unke bare main ham baithak kar chuke hai
 In the next meeting, we will consider the terms of the ticket distribution
 ”shah sidhe modi se aadesh lete hai isliye party or sarkaar ke alag-alag dishaao main jane kii koi ashanka nahin he

P

 Nevertheless, there are doubts in the minds of some leaders, which are being expressed in a tongue nowadays
 party ke ek mahasachiv kehete hai, “ve sidhe modi se aadesh lete hai or apane bharosemandon ko bataa dete hai
 This will lead to a smaller group replacing leadership in the name of efficiency
 ”technology kii savariuttar pradesh main amit shah kii vijay ranneeti par baariki se gaur karne se saaf pataa lagata he ki party tantra ko phir sakriy karne ke liye ve technology kaa bahut adhik sahaara lenge
 He has turned the party's Lucknow office
 aagaamee jang kii ranneeti banane ke liye war room or soshal media ke shaukeen, khaskar pehali baar matdaan karne vaale matadaataaon ko pakadaaey ke liye ity cell banaaya gaya he
 44-year-old Sunil Bansal, who came from the RSS to help run Shah's War Room in Lucknow, says, "in the last general election, there were about 11 crore new voters in the country
 bijepi or aresas kaa maananaa tha ki yahi nae matadaata hawa kaa rukh palat sakate hai
 The BJP had also opened a call center in its war room, thereby meeting two targets
 party se sahanubhuti rakhane vaale or samarthak party ke kaaryakramon kii jaankaree lene ke liye kol centre ke number par missd kol de sakate the
 Call center cadres made more than 20,000 people who gave missed calls as active party workers
 yah baat ujagar ho chuki he ki mukhyalayon se chunaav kii ruparekha behatar banane main madad ke liye naye ity systams khoje ja rahe hai
 According to informed people, Shah has clearly stated that party workers will have to find easy ways to communicate with the leaders instead of waiting for hours in front of their homes and offices
 jaankaron kaa yah bhi kahana he ki bijepi ke nae adhyaksh technology ke aise samaadhaan chaahate hai jo netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke bich samvaad kii vyavastha is tarah kare ki fori mahatv ke muddon ko unase alag rakhaa jaae jo philhal utane mahatvapurn nahin hai
 For example, he got mobile phones of booth workers in Uttar Pradesh
 kol centre kaaryakarta roj in kaaryakartaaon ko phone karte the or shaam ko bansal ko report dete the

 Modi first noticed Shah at a Sangh meeting in Ahmedabad in 1985 when Shah was a Sangh pracharak

 During the 1995 confrontation with Shankar Singh Baghela, Shah was one of Modi's strategists

 karunanidhi ke is tisare bete ne 1967 ke vidhansabha chunaav prachaar ke dauraan raajnneeti main kadam rakhe the jab ve mahaj 14 saal ke the or skool main padhai kar rahe the
 In that election, the DMK permanently excluded the Congress from Tamil Nadu

 The 70-year-old Duraimurugan, who was still the Principal Secretary, was elected the new treasurer

 He announced the party's priorities after being elected president

 This is an encouraging announcement for the grand alliance of opposition in 2019
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki stallin kaa rasta unke pita ke loktantric or aam sahmati vaale taur-tareeke se alag hoga
 In March this year, he told district-level officials and DMK cadres, "if you want the party to move forward, you have to accept my dictatorial methods now
" party main anushaasanheenata or party virdohi gatividhiyon ko bilkul bardaasht nahin kiya jayega

 "when Karunanidhi had grown older (especially since 2011), Stalin's management in his place has not been good
 unhone jab se party kii kaman sanbhali thi tab se dramuk lagaataar do vidhansabha chunaav haar chuki he or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main to vah ekadam saaf ho gai thi

 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki stallin aisa kar sakate hai

 But Stalin has been weak in communication and not readily available to the cadres
 ab adhyaksh banane ke baad unhen apni aadat badalani hogi or logon ke liye uplabdh rahanaa hoga
 Ramu Manivannan, a political scholar at Madras University, admits, "serious nature and distance from appearances are both their strengths but also weaknesses
" kisi bhi paristhiti main ve jaldbaaji yaa ghabrahat nahin dikhaate
 He is not even close to his father in terms of openness and transparency, yet he has presented himself as a sensible man — less soft, but unswerving

 unhone aarope lagaaya ki basapa kii sarkaar ne tanaav or ashanka kaa aisa vaataavaran bana diya he ki log zyada maatra main saamaan kharid kar rakh rahe he or isse bazaar main chizon ke daam bhi bad gayi he
 The SP State President said that the manner in which the Chief Minister is creating an atmosphere of fear and panic, it is feared that a well-planned conspiracy is being hatched behind it
 unhone yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki police bal ke 50 karod main lathidende, tarch helmet aadi kii khariddaari main basapa sarkaar kii kamishan khori chhipayadav ne kaha ki basapa mukhyamantri ab tak aresas, vishwa hindu parishad or bhaajapa ke sahare apni raajnneetik chamkaati rahi he or teen baar pradesh kii tajposhi main inhen shaktiyon kaa haath rahaa he
 He said that the intentions of Bharatiya Janata Party, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Vishwa Hindu Parishad are not clear and hence they are still engaged in misleading and manipulating the public by raising the question of faith
 yadav ne kaha ki kendra sarkaar kaa ravaiya thik usee tarah kaa he jaisaa chah disambar 1992 ko tha, jisamen babari masjid kaa vidhwans hua or abhi bhi kendra sarkaar kaa mukadrushtaa evam tamashbin bane rahanaa dharmanirpekshata ke liye khatra ban saktaa he
 He said that SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has always talked about the Ayodhya issue to be decided by negotiation or court decision and he still stands by his opinion
 unhone pradeshvaasiyon se apil kii he ki ve adalati faisle par sanyam evam dhary kaa parichay de or shanti banaaye rakhe tathaa sampradayik or ashaanti failaane vaale tatwon ke bhramjaal main na fansi he

 yah peediton or vanchito ke saath rahakar unke uddeshyon ko samajhakar unki peeth main kanjar ghopata he

 yah sabase bada avasarwaadi or vishwasghaatee he
 Everybody needs to be careful about this, do not forget that for your selfishness, it has also left the BJP
