 12: Google Doodle Apollo 11 Space Mission: 50 saal (50th Anniversary of the Moon Landing) pehle nasa (NASA) ne apollo 11 (apollo 11) mishan ko chand par bheja tha, or yah pehla mauka tha jab insaan ne chand (moon) par kadam rakhaa tha
 Today, Google has remembered the same historic step of human history (50th anniversary of Moon Landing) by creating a Google Doodle
 apollo 11 (apollo 11) ko july, 1969 main america ke florida ke kennedy spes centre (kennedy Space Center) se launch kiya gaya tha
 Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk to the moon after reaching the moon
 ye aitihaasik din 21 july, 1969 tha
 This team reached the moon, spent 21 hours there and took the rocks of the moon with them
 nil armstrong ke saath baj elderin (buzz Aldrin) bhi the, or unhone bhi moon war kii
 With regard to Apollo 11 Space Mission, we have memorized the creation of Google Doodle
 moon par gai teen logon kii team 24 july ko waapas lauti thi
 The third member of this team was Michael Collins
 unki landing pacific oshan main hui thi
 If you look at the special features of Apollo 11 Space Mission, 600 million people saw this moon walk on the moon on TV, which is a big record in itself
 chand par nil armstrong (neil Armstrong) or baj elderin ((buzz Aldrin)) ke foot print aaj bhi maujuud hai kyonki vahaan kii mitti kaaphi moti thi, or hawa nahin hone se ve footprint kabhi hat hi nahin sake
 In this way, the mark of man stepping on the moon is still intact today
 insaan kaa moon mishan apollo 11 specian mishan (apollo 11 Space Mission) hameshaa se kautuhal kaa vishay rahaa he, or hollywood kii filmon main isko khub dikhaaya bhi gaya he
 In these Hollywood films, the name 'first Man' (2018) comes to prominence, the film highlights the life of Neil Armstrong
 iske alaava 'from da arth tu da moon (1998)' or 'for ol mainkind (1989)' kaa naam pramukhataa se liya ja saktaa he

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal, jo kabhi apane raajnneetik pratidwandvi pradhanmantri narendra modi par tikhe hamale karte the, ab vah unpar zyada vyaktigat hamale nahin karte hai
 According to news agency IANS, 1 on Kejriwal's Twitter
 3 karod foloar hai
 He has not tweeted the word Modi once for the last 11 months
 unhone modi kaa zikr karte hue apana pichhlaa twit 9 march, 2017 ko kiya tha, kejariwal ne 2016 main modi kaa zikr apane twit main 124 baar va 2017 main 33 baar kiya tha
 He attacked the Prime Minister in these tweets
 modi par kiya tha sidhaa warparty ke netaaon va raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki modi ko lekar twit main yah badlaav aap ke chunaavon main nuksaan ke baad kiya gaya he
 Kejriwal in his earlier tweets targeted Modi
 in twits main 'modi ne dilli main apatkaal ghoshit kiya', 'taanashaah modi sarkaar' or 'kya modi sarkaar sena virdohi nahin he' aadi shaamil hai
 Due to the tweet about Modi, AAP was first lost in the by-elections to Punjab and Goa, then to the Delhi Municipal Corporation elections and the 2017 Rajouri Garden by-election
 tag karnaa bhi kiya band!kejariwal ne apane kisi bhi twit ko modi ko unke twitor acanut par 2017 va 2018 main ab tak kabhi tag nahin kiya he
 In 2016, he tagged the Prime Minister eight times
 kejariwal ne yahaan tak ki aap ke 20 vidhayakon ko janvari main is saal ayogy qaraar die jane ke dauraan pradhanmantri par nijee taur par hamale se parhez kiya he
 The AAP said that their mlas were disqualified at the behest of the BJP government at the Center
 sochi-samajhi ranneeti!party ke netaaon va kushraajnneetik vishleshakone se kaha ki yah ek sochi samajhi ranneeti ke tahat he
 a senior party leader said that this 'enlightened decision' was taken in a meeting convened after the defeat in the Delhi Municipal Corporation elections last year
 in chunaavon main aap 48 siton ke saath duusare number par rahi or bhaajapa ne 181 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 This was a major setback for the AAP, which won 67 of the 70 seats in the 2015 assembly elections
 aap netaa ne kaha, "isse (modi par hamale) hamen kuch hasil nahin ho rahaa tha or iske bajaay hamane shashan par dhyaan kendrit karne kaa faisla kiya
 "he said," It is clear that you have lost the confidence of the middle class and if they want to stay in Delhi, they need to regain trust
 " Police Commissioner BS Bassi came on Friday as part of the 'trust Program' to reiterate the same purpose of the 'delhi Police with you, for you, always' purpose among Delhiites and build trust of the police
 manch tha ajtak kaa, jahaan bassi naa sirf logon se kuch vaade kiye, balki apni pareshaaniyaan bhi share kii
 Delhi's development was not equal: Bassipolis Commissioner Bassine said that there are many areas of Delhi which have not been developed with planning
 un coloniyon ko anothrise kehane kii bajaae unhone kaha ki ye coloniyaan khud viksit hui hai
 Bassi said, 'there are narrow paths in such colonies
 gharon main parking kii vyavastha nahin he
 So people are forced to park the car on the streets
 'shahar ke har mohalle main jaakar chaalaan kaatna mumkin nahin: bassisadakon par gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se gaadi parking ke mudde par bassi ne kaha ki main coridor main police kii petroling hoti he
 But the Delhi Police does not have enough resources to cut the challan of such people in every locality
 jald phone se darj kara sakenge FIR: bassibies bassi ne kaha ki murder or rape jaise 'krime against human body' ko chhod baaki tamaam maamalon main log phone se hi exiaar darj kara sakate hai
 This facility can start within two months
 nirbhaya cond ke baad badi rape maamalon kii reportingbies bassi ne kaha ki saal 2012 main jahaan rape ke 300 maamle darj kiye gaye, vahiin is ghatana ke baad 3500 se zyada rape cese saamne aae
 He said that now people do not suppress such cases
 unhone kaha ki rape jaise samvedansheel maamalon main 'nalayaki' karne vaale pulicekarmiyon ke khilaaf sakhti se pesh aayaa jaataa he
 Every parent wants their child to be healthy and strong
 ve achche poshan kii jarurat ko samajhate hai or jaanate hai ki unke bachche ke sharir ke vikaas main protein kaa kya mahatv he
 However, many people do not know how much protein their child needs
 abhibhavak yah nahin samaj pate hai ki protein jaise poshak tatv ke maamle main bhi bahut zyada acchhee cheez buree sabit hoti he
 What is known? Dr
 Sriganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi Senior Doctor of Neurology Dr
 satish saluja kaa kahana he ki shishuon main protein kii atyadhik maatrabache ke bade hone ke sathmotaape kii koshikaon (fat cells) kii sankhya badhaati he va unamem insulin or ijief-1 (liver dwaara banaaya jane vaala hormone, jo insulin kii tarah kaam karata he) kaa utsarjan bad jaataa he
 Due to this, weight and obesity increase rapidly, which increases the risk of many other health problems like diabetes and heart disease
 duusare angon par padataa he prabhavaprotein kii jarurat se zyada maatra lene se shish ke aparipakv gurdon par bhi bura prabhaav pad saktaa he
 Excess protein does not accumulate in the human body
 sharir ise todakar bai-product banaata he, jiskaa mutr ke saath sharir se baahar nikalnaa jaruri hota he
 By consuming more protein, the kidneys start functioning faster and try to eject ketones that accumulate in the system
 isse bachche kii kidney par kaaphi dabaav padataa he
 The disease is immune
 Most of the proteins affected increase the amount of urea, hydrogen ions and amino acids (phenylalanine, triosine) in the blood, causing metabolic acidosis
 metabolic aniyamittaaon kaa yah sanyog viksit hote dimag par bura prabhaav daalata he
 Excessive protein leads to loss of calcium during fever or diarrhea, immunity to disease, and dehydration as well as weakness
 maa ke doodh main hota he bharpoor poshandow
 Saluja said that mother's milk is an excellent source of nutrition, which cannot be copied
 isamen protein kii maatra dynemic hoti he
 It varies according to the needs of the baby's body and provides him the right amount of protein
 shishu ke vikaas ke saath-saath maa ke doodh main bhi protein kii maatra uski jarurat ke anusaar kam hoti jaati he
 Surveys confirm that breastfeeding and nutrition efforts in India are always below the expected level
 neshnal family health survey reports ke mutabik, pehle chah maheenon main keval 46 pratishat bacchon ko hi stanpan karaayaa jaataa he
 According to the same report, only 44 percent of the 6 to 23 month old children are breastfed every day for the recommended number of breastfeeding per day (ie 6 to 8 months old children twice a day and 9 to 23 months old children a day) Breastfeeding three times)
 doctor se salaah lenaa na bhuulendow
 Saluja said that the choices we make for our children determine their development
 shishu ke jivan ke pehle 1,000 din sabase mahatvapurn hote hai
 Providing the best nutrition and the right amount of protein is most important for your baby
 jab bhi andeh ho to yah mahatvapurn he ki aap apane shishu kii vruddhi evam vikaas ke liye apane shishuroag chikitsak se sampark karen

 prakshepan ke bare main mahatvapurn baat yah he ki itani badi sankhya main rocket se upgrahon kaa prakshepan kiya ja rahaa he
 India will become the first country in history to succeed in launching 104 satellites at a time, compared to the successful launch of 37 satellites at one time by the Russian Space Agency
 baat sirf kehane se badi nahin hoti he
 It is also great because of the challenges it is being told
 is bollywood main ek se ek qaabil nirdeshak hai, jinke paas jokhim uthaane ke liye sansadhano kii kameen nahin hai
 But who among them has made the film at the time passing by us
 ye bade nirdeshak raajnneeti se dar gaye
 Shaken by the crowd of trolls
 anubhav sinha ne na sirf do-do baar jokhim uthaaya, balki twitor par aakar trol se khuleam bhid bhi rahe hai
 Many times they are clashing in their language
 varanaa aaj ke diggaj nirdeshak do twit main chup ho jate, haath jod lete
 Anubhav Sinha's film 'mulk' was a bigger film in terms of taking the iron than its time
 darshak samaaj jis tarah se whotsap kii bhashaa main sochane laga he, usase prabhavit hone laga he, anubhav ne usee kii bhashaa main 'mulk' banaakar khud ko itihaas ke pannon main kahin darj hone ke liye chhod diya he
 The politics of suspicion between Hindu and Muslim may continue even after that film, but the director's mind of experience could not run away from this question
 'mulk' ek safal film thi
 Experience in 'article-15' has caught the horn of the same Uttar Pradesh from where the politics of the country gets its manure and water
 film kaa ek kirdaar mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii style main bolta he
 The film also thanks Yogi Adityanath for his shooting
 film bob delan ko samarpit he
 How many journeys a man has to complete to become a man
 uttar pradesh ke agra lakhanu expresve se film shuru hoti he
 Many people have written about the film
 ek acchhee film vah bhi hoti he, jo yah sawaal paidaa kare ki yah bhi hota, to acha rahata
 i really like the experience frames
 aap ise shot kah sakate hai, seen kah sakate hai
 The lighting of the frame is neither of darkness nor light
 godhuli kii he yaa bhor kii he
 They do not evoke undue sentimentality
 balki kahani ke yatharth se dur ho chuke darshak se thodi duuri se samvaad karte hai
 There is no climax of tension, so that you start living your tension and forget the tension of the character or run away from it
 long or top shot main UP police kii bolero ko vah ek spes dete hai
 The jeep starts to look small
 power kaa simbel hokar bhi power-les
 Despite being a pawn, the police is no longer a pawn
 uske bheetar ek saath kai mohare hai
 Rather, the police does not have a department
 uske bheetar jati kaa mohalla ab ek duusare ko dekh lene kii taaqat kaa garh nahin he
 Their caste-name governments have also made them weak and inferior
 jaise hi aap is kathor yatharth ke qareeb jate hai, nirdeshak aapako saans lene kii jagah detaa he or seen change kar detaa he
 Dialogues are loaded, not overloaded
 jaise UP yaa hindi pradesh ke log in baton se sahaj ho gaye hai, usee sahajata se film logon se samvaad karti he
 The story goes on like a story
 jeep kii awaz kii nirantarata kaa kubi se istamaal kiya gaya he
 The speed of the car is slow
 aisi filmon main police kii gaadi bullate train lagati he
 In the film, every police car is slowed down by its burden, as if petrol is about to run out
 ayushmaan khurana par nirdeshak kaa puraa niyantran he
 Credit must also go to Ayushmann that he trusted the director
 shandaar abhinay kiya
 Gaurav Solanki and Anubhav Sinha together put the screenplay on track
 kuch bhi faaltu samvaad nahin he
 Special thanks to the composer for the background score
 uski vajah se bhi film pehle dekhi hui yaa suni hui nahin lagati he
 a director should name his film article-15, which is a resistance in itself
 har nirdeshak hit hone ke liye film banaata he
 Anubhav has chosen the title from the flop, but has made the film overwhelming
 samvidhan kaa ek puraa panna interval se pehle kaafii der tak bade screen par chipka dete hai
 This is resistance
 apane samay or samaaj se pratirodh
 Otherwise, the director could get more publicity by adding an item song of the same length
 nirdeshak ko item song shoot karnaa aata he, yah meraa vishwaas he
 However, see article-15
 yah film aapke bheetar ke darshak ko nae sire se darshak banaati he
 You feel good seeing you
 yah ek badi film he, isliye kai chizein rah gai hai
 That's why critics are dictating their own way
 nirdeshak ko raay de rahe hai
 This means that the film is resurrecting the discomfort and craft of making the film
 mujhe bahut din baad 'dekhnaa' acha laga
 Many days later, a director's film came out completely
 tabhi kahani shuru hone se pehle anuraag kashyap se lekar vishaal bharadwaj ke prati aabhaar prakat karti he

 Both of them have been in police custody for 23 days
 ab jaakar isaki jaankaree mili he ki umr abdulla or mahabuuba mufti ko police hiraasat main kahaan rakhaa gaya he?jahaan neshnal conference (ensi) ke netaa or purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla ko unke ghar ke paas hi hari nivas guest house main rakhaa gaya he, vahiin pipuls democratic party (pidipi) adhyaksh or purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ko unke ghar se dur chashme shahi ilaake main sarkari guest house main rakhaa gaya he
 Omar Abdullah spends most of his time exercising and playing in police custody, while Mehbooba Mufti spends most of his time reading newspapers and books
 donon purv mukhyamantriyon ko satellite televijan bhi muhaiyaa karaae gaye hai
 At the same time, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti turned down the offer of conditional release, following which the administration has increased the detention of both
 sutron ne bataaya, prashasan ne umr abdulla or mahabuuba mufti se kaha tha ki agar aap anuchhed 370 ke khilaaf pradarshan nahin karenge to aapako reeha kar diya jayega
 However, the two leaders rejected the administration's proposal
 donon ko jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane ke ek din baad yani 6 agast ko hiraasat main liya gaya tha
 The two leaders were first housed in the green residence guest house, but later shifted to separate guest houses
 darasal, mahabuuba mufti or umr abdulla ke bich bahasabaaji dekhne ko mili thi, jiske baad donon ko alag-alag guest house main rakhane kaa faisla liya gaya tha
 It is being told that Omar Abdullah is constantly monitoring the situation in the Kashmir Valley and taking information from the security forces
 donon netaa jammu kashmir main centre sarkaar ke kadam kaa shuru se hi virodh kar rahe hai
 Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah are constantly targeting the central government for increasing the deployment of security forces in Jammu and Kashmir
 jab jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 ko hataa diya gaya to mahabuuba mufti ne pratikriya dete hue kaha tha ki yah bhartiya loktantr kaa sabase kaala din he
 Jammu and Kashmir's decision to go with India in the year 1947 proved to be wrong
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki anuchhed 370 ko hataane kaa faisla avaidh or asanvaidhanik he
 Bihar Board, which is facing the brunt of notoriety in the inter topper scam, seems to be stuck in a new trouble

 It is said that Ruby Roy's copies have been vanished as part of a well-thought-out strategy to erase some evidence of the inter topper scandal
 inter topper ghotaalaa ke mastermind baccha raay or board ke purv adhyaksh lalakeshwar prasad ke bich topper banane ko lekar deal puri planning ke saath hui thi
 Many board employees are also said to be involved in this topper making game
 ab jab esaiti kii jaanch apni raftaar pakad chuki he, aise main rubi raay kii uttar pustikaon kaa gaayab ho janaa sidhe board ke karmiyon ko shaq ke ghere main le aata he
 'SIT never got copy of home science' City SP Chandan Kushwaha has said that the board has sought the answer under which circumstances the copy of Rubi Raiky home science disappeared from the strong room
 espi ne kaha ki rubi raay kii anya sabhi vishyon kii copy esaiti ke paas he, lekin home science kii uttar pustika shuru se esaiti ko uplabdh nahin karwaai gai
 The board has also been asked whose responsibility it was to keep the copies safe
 unhone kaha ki board kaa jawaab milane ke baad esaiti aage kii karrwai karegi
 Significantly, in the investigation so far, it is clear that Ruby Rai did not write her answer sheets in the examination itself
 rubi raay kii kaapiyon ko dusron se likhvaya gaya tha
 The process of matching Ruby Roy's handwriting has begun, so these copies have disappeared
 baccha raay ke college main milin darjanon kapiyambataya jaataa he ki baccha raay ke college main hi pariksha ke dauraan duusari kaapiyon par prashnon ke uttaron ko likhaa jaataa tha, jise baad main duusare kaapiyon main jod diya jaataa tha
 In the SIT investigation, it was revealed that several dozen copies of RM College were found in Bachcha Rai's college
 baccha raay ke is khel main board ke bhi kai karmi shaamil the
 How did the college's examination center change? In the Inter examination, Vishnu Rai College's examination center was first made to Gurukul Peeth of Hajipur, but at the last moment it was changed to GA Inter College of Hajipur without any written order

 musharraf ghoshnaa kar chuke hai ki unki party ol pakistan muslim lig in chunaavon main hissaa legi or ab wo khud pakistan main rah kar apni party kaa netritv karenge
 In 2009, former Pakistan dictator Musharraf went abroad on his own free will

 Pakistan had requested the agency to issue a Red Corner Notice against Musharraf in the Benazir Bhutto murder case, but Interpol said the request was politically motivated

 tippaniyan The Department of Telecommunications has issued a notice to all the telecom companies that all the mobile numbers in the country should be verified again through the KYC process
 kevysi (apane graahak ko jaane) main aadhaar card ko bhi joda jayega
 The department has given instructions that if a number is not verified or is not linked to the Aadhaar number then that number will be closed

 After that the operator has to verify based on that number whether the SIM card of the existing customer is available on that number or not? The notification states, "after the e-kyc process is completed, the operator must send a message to customers 24 hours in advance regarding re-verification after updating the data in the database or overwriting outdated information
 " The order also states that more than one mobile connection can be verified on one e-kyc but not many numbers

 There are so many layers of memories on the mind that an archaeologist is needed to get to the bottom of them

 Reminded me of the year when the sky was raining and i was telling the world with Mike that Bismillah Khan should not get the soil rough on his body, no hard piece should be pierced, so the sky will be moist Used to be

 bharat main zindaa batch gaye log kai logon ke liye bharat ratna kii maang karte hai
 There is a lot of politics
 ab to bharat ratna kii maang kaa live kawarez hota he
 You have not done anything like this
 kabhi kabhaar tahalne ke liye rajya sabha kii memberi nahin maangi
 Thinking about all these things, now i completely returned to you
 yaad aane lagi wo baat, jab aapke paas manaane gaya tha
 You were angry
 gaaliyaan de rahe the
 i had received so much
 koi buzurg jab gaali detaa he, to wo gaali nahin hoti, aashirwad he
 Khan Sahib, i will tell the next generation that the world heard the clarinet from Bismillah, but i have heard abuses
 aap hans die
 Your face resembled that of my grandfather
 hamane apane naanaa-nani ko kam dekha jiyaa he
 i started talking to you
 aap is baat par bhi sharma se gaye the
 Your anger was becoming restless to the tune of the clarinet
 aap hi ne kaha ki ajtak kisi ke liye akele nahin bajaayaa
 i tell you camera chaalu tha
 The remaining people were thrown out of the room
 aapkaa fefda haankene laga
 i started refusing, so you said that you have not played for many days, so the clarinet is angry
 maan jaaegi
 You became restless to me like a father
 to aapaki mazaar par main khadaa tha
 It was evening
 ajay vahaan tak le gaye, jahaan tak aapkaa hissaa is lok kii mitti main bachaa hua tha
 Poster of Bharat Ratna Bismillah Khan on the wall
 dilaphenk muskuraahat
 There is no match to your laughter
 aisa laga, jaise puch rahe hon ki bataao ye dhun kisi lagi
 You heard the clarinet of Bismillah
 aapaki shararti ankhen
 Uff
 jis banaras kaa aap qissa sunaate rahe, usee banaras main aap ek qissa hai
 But in the same Benares, your tomb could not be completed even in ten years
 ek tasviir he or gheraa taaki pataa chale ki jisaki shehanai se aaj bhi hindustan kaa ek hissaa jaagta he, wo yahaan so rahaa he
 Those who listen to the radio know this
 mazaar ke paas khadey ek shaks ne bataaya ki aapaki mazaar isliye kachi he, kyonki is jagah ko lekar shiya or sunni main vivaad he
 The case is going on faisalaa aa jaae to aaj bana den
 It is not your country but the fate of this country that you have not had even a single grave
 iske liye bhi kisi jaj kii kalam kaa intazaar he
 Why do we give Bharat Ratna to someone
 bharat ratna dekar bhi gotiyaa patteedaar kii polatics se mukti milegi ki nahin
 Are Shias and Sunnis not in your shehnai? kya wo do gaj zamin aapke naam par nahin chhod sakate
 Can not Banaras take initiative for you kis baat kaa banaras ke log banaras-banaras gaate phirte hai
 i am not able to write on your personality and clarinet, so thought that i should write a letter
 is baat kii maafi maangate hue ki aapako main bhi bhul gaya hum
 You miss, but never took your news
 aapse milakar lautate hue yahi soch rahaa tha ki kitna kam mila aapse, magar kitna zyaada de diya he aapane
 Not exactly, but i am missing something
 jo main aapke nidhan par live prasaaran main bol rahaa tha
 Bismillah Khan was the father of Benares
 aaj banaras se uske baap kaa saaya uth gaya he
 We are all like this, Khan Sahib
 aap jaanate hi hai
 So it's nice to see you smiling
 is baap ne jite ji kuch nahin chaha, to ek qabr yaa ek mazaar kii kya bisaat
 i also took a picture

 bhartiya sena ne myanmar seemaa main do kilometre andar ghuskar ugravadiyon ke do camp puri tarah tabah kar daale
 About 100 militants were reported killed in this army action
 soochna or prasaaran mantri rajyavardhan singh rathore ne isaki pushti karte hue kaha ki ye pradhanmantri dwaara liya gaya aitihaasik or saahasik faisla tha
 It is also a strong message for those neighboring countries who promote terrorism
 gauratlab he ki pichley hafte chaar june ko manipur ke chandel jile main ugravadiyon ne ghaat lagaakar hamalaa kiya tha jisase sena ke 18 jawan shahid ho gaye
 After this, the government decided that strict action should be taken against the militants

 What was then, the army attacked the militant camps at nine thirty in the morning in a planned manner with the support of the Myanmar government
 sena kii is karrwai main 100 se zyada ugravadi maare gaye hai
 Most of them were the same militants who were involved in ambush and killed 18 soldiers
 is abhiyaan main ugravadiyon ke do camp puri tarah se barabaad kar die gaye hai
 After the killing of 18 soldiers, this action is being said to be a morale-boosting for the frustrated and angry Indian Army
 is karrwai main sena ne MI-17 helicopter kaa istemaal kiya
 Army sources say that after 1993, the Indian Army crossed the Myanmar border and carried out such action and in this the government and army also fully supported the Indian Army
 sutron ke anusaar bhartiya para commando subah MI-17 helicopter se myanmar seemaa main gaye or oparation ko anjaam dekar waapas laut aae
 The special thing is that no commando was even injured in this action
 tippaniyan Earlier in 2003, the army did such an operation against the ULFA by entering the Bhutan border
 sena ne jis tarah kii karrwai kii he, aise hi halaat 2008 main mumbai hamale ke vakt bhi ban gaye the
 At that time, similar action was being said in pok by crossing the loc, but due to lack of green signal from the government, the army could not take action against the terrorists sitting across the border
 vaise myanmar se lagi bharat kii seemaa 1643 kilometre lambii he
 There is no fence like the Pakistan border between the two countries
 isaki kaa phayda kai dfa ugravadi sangthan uthaate hai or yahi vajah he ki 4 june ko ugravadi manipur main sena ke kafile par hamalaa karne ke baad myanmar kii taraf bhaag nikle the
 Confirming this, Information and Broadcasting Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said that it was a historic and bold decision taken by the Prime Minister
 ye un padosi deshon ke liye bhi ek kadaa sandesh he jo aatankwaad ko badhaava dete hai
 It is worth mentioning that on June 4 last week, in the Chandel district of Manipur, militants ambushed and killed 18 soldiers of the army
 iske baad sarkaar ne tay kiya ki ugravadiyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaae
 As a result, the army received strong news that the militants are planning to attack again along the Manipur and Nagaland border
 phir kya tha, myanmar sarkaar ke sahyog se yojanabaddh tareeke se sena ne ugravadi campon par subah saadhe nau baje hamalaa bol diya

 According to sources, the Indian para commandos went to the Myanmar border in the morning in a MI-17 helicopter and returned after carrying out the operation

 The comments isse pehle 2003 main sena ne aisa oparation bhutan seemaa main ghuskar ulpha ke khilaaf kiya tha
 Similar action was taken by the army, similar circumstances were created during the 2008 Mumbai attack

 tula raashi:kya aapane kabhi sochaa he ki sitambar or oktober main sabase zyada shaadiyaan kyon hoti hai? darasal, is samay main tula raashi ke logon kaa janm hota he

 Aaj tak-axis Exit Polls in Haryana; Expected Poll of hung assembly was also done in Lok Sabha Elections before assembly; Everyone was shocked when Exit Poll was released for Haryana Assembly Election by charismatic-axis My India
 hairaan hone kaa kaaran tha ki ye baaki agenciyon ke ek din baad jari kiya gaya or iske nattejey sabase alag hai
 But today when the results are coming, everyone is praising the exit poll of Aaj tak-axis My India
 kyonki ye agsit pole sabase sateek baitha he
 Pradeep Gupta of Axis My India spoke to Aaj Tak on this exit poll on Thursday
 unhone kaha ki hamaare agsit pole ko lekar bazaar main kai tarah ke sawaal uthe the, log aarope laga rahe the ki india today / ajtak ne exis kaa agsit pole roak diya he, kyonki isamen bhaajapa haar rahi he
 Pradeep Gupta said that there was nothing like this, i myself had appealed to Aaj Tak to give us a day because the results which have come in the exit poll are shocking
 isliye ham use jaanchana chaahate hai, hamaari is apil ko ajtak ne sweekaar kar liya or agsit pole ek din ke liye taal diya gaya
 In the exit poll which was released by many news channels and agencies about Haryana, BJP was shown getting a historic victory
 kisi agsit pole main bijepi ko 60+ yaa phir 70+ siten di ja rahi thim
 But Axis My India did not do this, these were the figures in the poll conducted about Haryana
 
 (total 90 seats) BJP: 32-44 Congress: 30-42 JJP: 6-10 Others: 6-10 What are the real results? The results that have come out today are similar to this exit poll
 abhi tak bhaajapa 39, congress 33, jejepi 10 or anya 8 siton par he
 Let me tell you that before this, the exit poll of Axis My India and Aaj Tak was also very accurate about the Lok Sabha elections
 kisi bhi anya agency ne BJP ko 300+, NDA ko 350+ seat nahin di thi
 That exit poll was completely accurate not only on the basis of the whole country but also on the states
 ye bhi padhein-exit Poll: haryana main BJP ke liye raah aasaan nahin, congress de rahi kadi takkar Narendra Modi, who gave the slogan of Na khoona na khana denega, will now have to answer it

 popular singer arijit singh ne salmaan khan se publikali maafee mangakar sabko chaunkaa diya he
 Arijit Singh wrote a post on his Facebook page requesting Salman Khan not to remove his song from his upcoming film 'sultan'
 arijit ne likhaa he ki unhonesalmaan kaa apmaan nahin kiya thaor vah har tarah se unhen yah samajhane kii koshish kar thak chuke hai
 So they thought that the last way left is to publicly apologize on Facebook
 bollywood singer ne likhaa kisalmanako galatfahami hui he or ise dur karne ke liye unhone kai baar messej bhi kiye lekin unka koi jawaab nahin aayaa
 Arijit also wrote that whatever happened during that show happened at the wrong time
 phir bhi agar aapako aisa lagata he ki mujh se galati hui he yaa maine aapaki inslt kii he to main aapse maafee maangata hum
 Me and my family have been your fans for a long time
 maine aapse chijen clear karne ke liye kai baar contact karne kii koshish kii
 i apologized but you did not respond
 arijit ne aage likhaa, nita ji ke yahaan bhi main aapse maafee maangane hi aayaa tha lekin aapane uskaa bhi jawaab nahin diya
 But, no problem
 main aapse sabake saamne maafee maang rahaa hum
 i request that you do not remove the song that i have sung in your film 'sultan'
 aap chahen to kisi or se ye gaanaa gavaakar rakh len lekin kam se kam mere gane kaa ek varjan to rakhen
 i have sung many songs sir
 lekin chahta hum ki meri librari main kam se kam ek gaanaa to aisa ho jo maine aapke liye gaaya ho

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to Delhi Chief Secretary MM Kutty saying that the payment of arrears of medicines and other health care products suppliers in Delhi's hospitals has not been paid for a long time, due to which there is a shortage of medicines in hospitals
 
 siem ne mukhya sachiv ko bhugtan main deree ke kaarnon par 24 ghante main report dene ko kaha he
 Along with this, it has also been asked to make the complete system, fix the responsibility of the officer, delay in payment and in case of paying interest on the arrears, cut the salary of the concerned officer
 kejariwal ne mukhya sachiv se somvaar tak puraa plan maanga he Although the Health Minister of Delhi is Satyendar Jain, but there are some reasons why Kejriwal has written a letter to the Chief Secretary on non-payment towards the Health Department
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne apane kaam karne kaa tarika badal diya he
 Now instead of telling or ordering the minister of that department for any work, he appoints the chief officer of the concerned department or the chief secretary of all the officers of the Delhi government by giving orders or instructions

 Accountability is key to good governance
 Someone must be held accountable n face consequences for inefficiency or wrongdoing - Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) May 30, 2017 1
 Even before this, when Kejriwal decided that all the ministers, the Chief Minister would meet the general public every morning from June 1, the officers were also included in it and directed the Chief Secretary to make a plan and implement it
 2
 Kejriwal himself expressed the fact that medicines were not available in the hospitals and also wrote a letter to the Chief Secretary regarding this

 3
 barsaat se pehle dilli sabhi bade naalon kii safaai kaa jimmaa PWD sachiv ko diya gaya

 yahi nahi kyonki alji ne PWD sachiv ko koardination kamity ke pramukh banaaya he to nagar nigam or PWD ke naalon main vivaad kaa nipataara bhi PWD sachiv karenge
 The comments daramil, baat ye he ki dilli main shashan or prashasan ab uparajyapal ke haath me he isaliye afasar bhi bina kisi sanshay yaa bhram ke alji daphtar yaa mukhya sachiv daftar se aadesh lete hai or report karte hai, jisase mantriyon ke haath me zyada kuch rahata nahin
 Whereas the general public or media summons replies from the Chief Minister and the Ministers

 For this, the feedback received from the general public and party workers after the corporation elections is also responsible, in which it came out that the ministers of the government and the mlas of the party have cut off from the general public and party workers, the work of the general public is far from the party's own Workers are unable to work and in the fight of Delhi Government vs
 Central Government, the development work in Delhi is stopped, the people are not working and the battle is coming
 The image of the Aam Aadmi Party from the elders became that of the Anti Modi Party from the Anti Corruption Party

 Before the rainy season, the responsibility of cleaning all the major drains of Delhi was given to the PWD Secretary
 kejariwal ne aadesh dekar kaha ki PWD sachiv (yani IAS afasar) naalon kii safai nijee taur par sunishchit karenge
 Not only this, because LG has made the PWD Secretary the head of the Coordination Committee, then the PWD Secretary will also settle the dispute in the municipal and PWD drains
 tippaniyan Actually, the thing is that the governance and administration in Delhi is now in the hands of the Lieutenant Governor, so the officers also take orders and report from LG office or Chief Secretary office without any doubt or confusion, so that there is not much left in the hands of the ministers
 
 jabaki aam janata yaa media mukhya mantri or mantriyon se jawaab talab karti he
 In such a situation, Kejriwal has devised this new way of governance in order to maintain its relevance, get officers working and to put the responsibility and accountability on the officers instead of the minister
 iske liye nigam chunaav ke baad aam janata or party kaaryakartaaon se mila wo feedback bhi jimmedaar he, jisamen ye nikalakar aayaa ki sarkaar ke mantri or party ke vidhayak aam janata or party kaaryakartaaon se cat chuke hai, aam janata ke kaam to dur party ke apane kaaryakartaaon ke kaam nahi ho paa rahe or dilli sarkaar banaam centre sarkaar kii ladaai main dilli main vikaas kaary rukne, aam logon ke kaam naa hone or aaye din ladaai khabaron se aam aadmi party kii chhavi anti karpshan party se anti modi party kii ban gai
 So now Kejriwal has stopped the attack on PM Modi and instead of appearing to fight, he has decided to run the rule by fixing the responsibility of the officers

 - input bhashaa se Aaj Tak has made a major disclosure in the case of Mumbai attacks
 hamalon ke dauraan aatankiyon or pakistan main baithe unke aakaaon ke bich ho rahi baatcheet kaa tepe aaj tak ke haath laga he
 The recorded conversation in this tape clearly shows that the Mumbai attackers were being given all the instructions from Pakistan
 ye ricarding kareeb saat ghante kii he, jisase ye bilkul saaf ho jaataa he ki mumbai hamale kii sajeesh rachane vaale aakaaon kii sainik kushalta kitni zyada thi or is hamale ke liye unhone kitni badi taiyaari kii thi
 The phones of the terrorists of Mumbai remained connected to the War Room of Terror in Pakistan round the clock
 pakistan se kaise khelaa gaya aatank kaa khooni khel, pal-pal kaise or kisne di aatankiyon ko cmand, pehali baar aap khud sunen apane kaanon se aatank ke khaufnak tepe
 The terrorists sitting in the war room had a full blueprint of Nariman House, Taj and Trident, and on this basis, the terrorists sitting in Pakistan were telling each terrorist in front of Mumbai to tell them when to hide and when
 When to come, when to throw grenades, when to fire and when to fire
 mumbai main morcha aatankwaadiyon ko lenaa tha
 But what would be their position, they were deciding the mastermind sitting in Pakistan on the outskirts
 wo bataa rahe the ki kaise ek ko seedhiyaan cover kerani he or duusare ko cross firing ke liye pojishan badalani he
 They were telling how life could be threatened in case of grenade burst when standing on a wall
 jaahir he ek-ek kone kii khoobiyon or kamiyon se wo acchhee tarah waakif the
 Such command can be given only by those who have either taken the training of the army themselves and those who have a good experience of military operations
 sawaal uthta he ki aatankwaadiyon ke mastermind kahin wo log to nahin jinka paak sena se kabhi koi rishta rahaa ho
 This will be the first case of terrorist attack in the world in which their bosses sitting in another country were giving live command to the terrorists
 cmand pakistan se mil rahaa tha or oparation mumbai main chal rahaa tha
 The terrorists were most interested in ruining the Taj during the Mumbai attack
 pakistan main baithe aatank ke aakaa baar-baar ek hi baat par jor de rahe the ki puure taj ko aag ke hawaale kar do
 The terrorists hiding in the Taj probably did not know Urdu properly, so they were constantly talking in Punjabi
 taj kaa manjar hangamakhez tha
 Four terrorists entered the Taj
 ek ghante tak katleam machaane ke baad aatankiyon ne taj ke cameraa number 632 main apana thikaana bana liya
 Two terrorists remained in this room while two went out in the corridors of Taj in search of some other suitable place
 lekin remote control paak main baithe aakaaon ke haath main tha jo phone par hi ranneeti bana rahe the
 Here is an excerpt from the conversation between the terrorists and their masters who entered the Taj: Aaka: Do you take care, are the stairs covered or not? No one should come from below
 aatanki: kuch bhi cover nahin he
 We are sitting very high, do not know where both of them have gone? Aaka: My brother, do cover the stairs, if they come up then you have no use sitting in the room above
 holnuma cameraa dekhnaa tha
 Terrorist: i said a lot, they are not coming
 main unhen baar-baar kah rahaa hum
 Aaka: They must have taken positions on the other side
 wo gaye kahaan hai? kitni dur gaye hai?aatanki: unhen to najadik hi bheja tha, ab dur chale gaye honge
 Aaka: Have you not gone down? Terrorist: No, they know that the work has started below
 ab pataa nahin
 Aka: Do you have a grenade? Throw down the grenade of course
 grenade acha bhala vafa karata he
 When throwing a grenade, they think for 15-20 minutes whether to proceed or not
 aatanki: acha ek grenade phenkata hum
 The important part of the strategy was to tell the terrorists the maneuver to take the front and the boss was doing some work in this manner
 aakaa: upar kamaron ko aag laga do, jo kamare khaali karogo, aag laga dena mere bhai
 You know what to do
 unhen neeche lekar aana he, police he neeche, neeche puraa paharaa do, maine kaha tha ki har 15 -20 minute baad grenade phenk diya karo, wo phenk rahe ho naa?aatanki: thik he ab upar se aate samay sarpraraise dekar aaenge, darwaja entry badi jabardast he, shishe bahut bade-bade hai
 Merry: Break the glass
 aatanki: nahin-nahin cameraa strong hold ke liye he
 Aaka: Yes, have you found out for a strong hold? Terrorist: Great room
 vaise mahfuj he, dabl-dabl kichan he, bath he, ek chota sa bazaar lagata he
 Aaka: Is there water here? Terrorist: Yes
 paak: pani kii baaltee apane paas rakhni he
 Have to keep towel and water bucket with you
 aansu gas ke jo gole police vaale maarenge to pani or tauliye ne aapkaa bachaav karnaa he
 Sitting in Pakistan, the mentor was repeatedly explaining how and when to use the grenade, and the terrorists were telling minute-by-minute situation to the masters
 aakaa: pojishan badalo, pojishan badalo, ikatthe mat baitho pojishan badalo
 Throw grenades from where they are coming
 aatanki: sohaib ne fire kiya to wo peeche bhaag gaye hai
 Aka: Okay my brother
 chaaron ikatthe na baitho, fail jaao taaki koi bhi upar aayega to ek pojishan ko cover karegaa to teen jagah se fire khayega bhi naa
 Terrorist: Then shall we go to the room together? Aaka: Well, the one with you? Is there no one in front? Terrorist: No, no
 phir to ham hi aamane-saamne ho jaaenge
 It is clear from the entire conversation that there were terrorists inside the Taj and their orders across the border
 yani mumbai ke hamalaavaron kii door pakistan ke control room main thi
 On the phone itself, he was getting everything done in Mumbai which he wanted
 aapas main wo jis tarah baatcheet kar rahe the usase saaf jaahir he ki ek khaas team aatankwaadiyon ko cmand dene ke kaam main lagi thi
 Just like during the war, senior army officers sit down and make strategies and tell the army's contingents the next strategy
 yahi ho rahaa tha mumbai hamalon ke dauraan
 But the question is, who was in command of the war room of the terrorists? How many people were there in the panic room? And who were they? Pakistan has not yet answered all these questions
 taarikh 27 november, vakt raat ek baj kar chaar minute, jagah hotel tazoparation beshak mumbai main chal rahaa tha lekin uskaa remote control tha pakistan main
 The terrorists hiding in Mumbai were giving a moment's notice to their commanders sitting in Pakistan and on the basis of that, Pakistan commanders were making further strategies
 paak: aapako bataaya tha ki kamare main camere lage hai, aap lite band kar do, saare batan band kar do, jahaan bhi camera dikhaai pade fire maar do
 Take care of all these things, my hero
 ye sab chijen aapako expos karne vaali hai, ki aap kitne aadmi ho, kahaan ho, kis haalat main ho, aapaki sari sicurity baahar aati he
 Taj: We do not know where the cameras are? Where are you not? Pak: Why not? What's up Is the light on? What is there other than light? Taj: For example, there are lights
 pataa nahin kis-kis chiz kaa batan he?darasal mumbai police or commando aatankwaadiyon kaa lokation pataa karne ke liye hotel ke sisitivi kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 From there the police control room got the news that the terrorists are in the room number 632 of the sixth floor of the hotel
 lekin pakistan ke aatanki waar room tak khabar pahunchi ki wo cameraa number 360 yaa 361 main hai
 The masters felt that their pawns were getting trapped, that's why they immediately ordered the CCT cameras to be destroyed and also ordered the hotel to be set on fire
 taj: har said par bade-bade computer pade hai
 22-22 30-30 inch computers are lying
 paak: unako jalaayaa nahin?taj: bas ham abhi aag lagane lage hai
 Seeing inshaallah, now you will see fire after a while
 paak: aag hamen yahaan tak najar aae tabhi to he
 Sholay is seen rising
 taj: abhi thodi der main hi aapako nazar aegi aag lagi hui
 Taj: Listen, two brothers have gone to open the room on the sea side
 jab khol lenge to phir ham is kamare ko aag laga ke udhar aa jate hai
 Pak: Good fire my hero, don't lie down
 taj: cameraa ek hi he hamaare paas
 Where will we go if set on fire? Pak: Ok, you are on the top floor? Even the curtains which are lying in the street, set them on fire and go to the other side
 taj: vahi bataaya na
 When other brothers come, they set them on fire
 paak: bahut let ho jaaoge
 The grenade is also not thrown
 kitni der lagati he grenade phenkane main? neeche bahut gaadiyaan khadi hai
 Taj: i am sending both again and again
 wo phenkate hi nahin, aise hi waapas aa jate hai
 Don't know what are you doing? They say they throw but do not throw
 paak: grenade phenkna koun sa bada kaam he? pin khinchon or neeche phenk do
 Taj: From what we have thrown the box, there is no smoke in the entire hotel
 paak: to phir kya hua? usase pareshaan nahin hona he
 Whatever had to happen, it happened
 thodi der main wo khatm ho jayega
 You continue your work
 taj: thik he
 Pak: Whenever you call, you have to attend
 aag vaale kaam main der nahin kerani
 Taj: The fire will go on now inshaallah
 pakistan ke waar room se cmand dene vaale log koun the? waar room se jab bhi mumbai main aatankwaadiyon ke paas phone aata to udhar se zyaadaatar teen hi log baat kiya karte the
 Jundal, Wasi and Kafa
 mumbai main morcha liye aatankwaadi har baar baatcheet ke dauraan bhi sirf inhen ke naam le rahe the
 Yes, there is also mention of an elderly man in the middle two or four times and the way this elder is mentioned or the way he is mostly silent, it seems that his standing among the terrorists sitting in the war room is the most Was big par ye chaaron koun the or kya ye unke asli naam the yaa code nem
 At present, Pakistan has not responded to this
 vaise is puri baatcheet kii ek or ahm baat ye he ki phone har baar waar room se hi kiya jaataa tha
 The terrorists who came to Mumbai did not make a single call on their behalf
 shaayad ye bhi unki sajeesh kaa ek hissaa tha

 US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's first stop when she arrived in India in May was not to talk about defense or trade, but to meet the victims, rescued women and activists involved in ending sex trafficking
 clinton ko 19 varshiya uma ne bataaya, ''kharidaaron ko giraftaar karne par hi veshyalay band honge or ham bhi surakshit rahengi
 "uma then asked Clinton to wear a wristband that read," Gentle men, do not promote prostitution
 '' phir unhone clinton se, sex trephiking kii maang kaa virodh karne vaale abhiyaan 'apane aap' main shaamil hone kaa aagrah kiya
 Clinton quickly tied the wristband to her wrist
 iske baad unhone kamare main maujuud sabhi logon se aisa hi karne ko kaha
 The very next moment, this band began to appear on the wrists of all diplomats, intelligence or service members, and even media personnel
 agle din adhiktar akhabaaron ne restband pahane logon kii tasviren chhaapi thim
 When Clinton arrived in a conference room filled with other activists opposing trafficking, she saw American officials driving out the press
 unhone tatkaal mujhse poocha ki kya main press waalon ko waapas bulaanaa chaahati hum: ''kya hamen yahaan prachaar ke liye unki jarurat nahin he? is abhiyaan ko mukhyadhara main laane ke liye press mahatvapurn he
 "because of him, two journalists were allowed to stay in the room
" mujhe sex industry ke failaav par baat karnaa ab bhi ubaau lag rahaa tha
 He again excitedly said, "don't panic: i am a cheer leader for you from far away
 ''pichley kai varshon main maine dekha he ki hillari clinton chaahe jis pad par rahen, ve kisi mahila ko sansthagat sahyog yaa vyaktigat protsaahan ke madhyam se puri patibaddhta ke saath samay detii rahi hai
 i first met him in 1997
 tab ve america kii pratham mahila thim or maine da sailing of inocents naam kii ek documentary banaai thi jo nepal se mumbai tak sex trephiking par thi
 At her invitation, i went to the White House in the US to serve on the first advisory board of Vital Voices
 yah unheen kaa banaaya ek sanghathan he jiskaa uddeshy duniyabar kii mahila rahanumaon ko shashakt bananaa he
 i remember that i told them that we have to pay more attention to sex trafficking - to destroy this system of prostitution, new policies, laws have to be made and global treaties will be made because the US, India and other countries of the world have this quagmire The number of girls getting trapped in the city is constantly increasing
 unke sahyogiyon ne mujhe kai pramukh seenetteron se milaayaa jinke saath maine america main anti trephiking kanoon kaa masauda taiyaar karne ke liye kaam kiya
 i was like an expert witness before the US Senate
 america main 2000 main trephic victim privension act paarit ho gaya
 i am also fighting for a change in the law in my country so that instead of accusing and arresting women and girls involved in prostitution, the law can take the brokers and customers who are trying to buy them
 Huh
 maine clinton se milane kaa faisla kiya
 i wrote a letter to Secretary Clinton's office urging them to meet women associated with 'on their own' when they came to India and asked for support of our campaign
 main jaanati thi ki ve apane vyast kaarykram se hamaare liye samay nikaal hi lengi or duniya main haashie par rahane vaali in ladakiyon ke saath khadi hongi
 He did the same in Kolkata last month
 maine afsos jataayaa, ''17 saal pehle aap se pehali baar milane ke samay se lekar ab tak main trephiking ko mukhyadhara kaa masalaa banane ke liye sangharsh kar rahi hum
 "he reminded me," You were not doing this when we first met
 '' unka yah kahana mere liye hausala badhaane vaala tha
 In fact, since the making of the documentary, i began to play a more active role in organizing the victims and rescued women against their exploitation
 satta main rahane vaali koi bhi mahila sabase pehle to sirf yaad rakhkar or phir dhyaan dekar hi baaki logon kii madad kar sakati he
 Then when she went back to New York, she continued to raise this issue
 clinton hadein langhane yaa asuvidhajanak or akasar adrishy rahane vaale masalon kaa samarthan karne se nahin daratin
 They have helped bring out the activist aspect of my own life
 unhone america main kanoon paarit karne ke liye bharat se meri visheshgyata kaa phayda uthaane main katai hichak nahin dikhaai
 i have started to feel that she sees the issue of women as a universal issue which is beyond the limits of any nationalism
 hillari clinton ne mujhe yah sikh di he ki ek taqatvar mahila, jis hawa main ham saans le rahe hai uske kan-kan main badlaav laa sakati he-na sirf apane desh kii mahilaon ke liye balki duusare deshon kii mahilaon ke liye bhi

 Aam Aadmi Party leaders today unanimously appealed to party leader Arvind Kejriwal that if Bharatiya Janata Party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi contests from Uttar Pradesh's Varanasi, he should take the field against him
 samoochee party unke saath khadi hogi, haalanki baad main kejariwal ne apane bhaashan main is mudde par kuch nahin kaha
 The first rally of the Aam Aadmi Party was held in Uttar Pradesh at Ramlila Maidan in Kanpur, which was named as 'broom Chalon Cheater Bhagao Rally'
 is raily main party ke netaa sanjay singh ne kaha ki aisi khabaren mil rahi hai ki bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi uttar pradesh ke varanasi loksabhaa seat se chunaav lard rahe he
 Arvind Kejriwal is saying that he will not contest Lok Sabha elections, but all of us party workers appeal to Kejriwal to contest elections from Varanasi against Narendra Modi
 ham sab arvind ke saath hai or jo desh ko bachaana chaahate hai vah modi ke khilaaf kejariwal ko jitaayen
 Singh asked the public and the leaders and workers of the Aam Aadmi Party sitting on the platform whether Kejriwal should contest the election against Modi, and everyone raised their hands with one voice
 lekin kejariwal ne is baat kaa koi jawaab na to us samay diya or na hi baad main apane bhaashan main ki vah narendra modi ke khilaaf varanasi se chunaav ladenge yaa nahin

 Narendra Modi and Mamata Banerjee were on one stage on Sunday, always attacking each other from different political platforms
 is dauraan donon netaaon ke bich tamaam kayaason se ulat 'mithravat' vyavhaar dikhaa
 This attitude is being seen as a new political equation, while the Congress has become very upset with it
 party ne mamata ko is babat chetavanee bhi de di he
 Interestingly, during the first West Bengal visit of the Prime Minister, where the Chief Minister of the state Mamata Banerjee shared the stage and talked about working together, the two leaders also held talks at Raj Bhavan on Saturday
 'didi' ke is nae raajnneetik rujhaan ko dekhte hue congress kii peshaani par bal pad gaye hai
 But on the party's warning, Didi has said nothing directly and called for opposition's solidarity on the land acquisition bill
 'modi kaa he siddh trek record'congress party ke media vibhaag ke randeep surajevaala ne kaha, 'centre se zyada se zyada laabh lene ke liye sabhi rajyon main hode lagi rahati he
 We are not stopping Mamata Banerjee or her party TMC from deciding the best interests of West Bengal
 haalanki, ham mamata banerjee ko chetavanee dena chaahate hai ki modi kaa 'istemaal karo or chhod do' kii raajnneeti kaa siddh trek record he or vahatiemasiko bhi tab thenga dikhaa denge, jab unka makasad puraa ho jayega
 The Congress-led opposition camp is looking at Modi's new equation with Mamata as a trick, under which PM Modi is trying to break the opposition's solidarity on various issues
 congress isliye bhi baichaiyn ho uthi he ki use dar he agar uske kheme kii partiyaan aise hi modi kii mureed hoti gayi to bhoomi adhigrahan bill, jiesti bill jaise anya muddon par sarkaar ko gherne ke uske abhiyaan ko jabardast jhatka lagegaa
 What can happen next? According to political analysts, Modi has realized Mamata's compulsions
 aarthik tangi se jujh rahe pashchim bengal ko centre ke madad kii darkaar he
 BJP is trying to strengthen its position in West Bengal before the Vidhan Sabha elections
 isse donon ke bich takaraav kii sthiti aage bhi banegi, vahiin mamata banerjee ne singoor ghatana ke baad bhoomi adhigrahan ke maamle par jo ravaiya ab tak apana rakhaa he use aage barkaraar rakhane ke liye land bill par narmi baratna unke liye sambhav nahin hoga
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see what changes in the behavior of TMC in Parliament during the last week of the budget session starting from Monday

 Only 14 year old Ayush living in Bhopal has come as an angel for such prisoners
 darasal bhopal ke shivaji nagar main rahane vaale aayush ne aane vaale 15 agast ke liye aisa kaam kiya he, jisaki ummid bahut kam logon ko hogi
 Ayush, studying in Class X, has brought smiles on the faces of 14 prisoners and their families in jail in Indore and Bhopal
 aayush ne scolership main mili rupayon ko donnet kar 14 aise kaidiyon kii rihaai kaa rasta saaf kar diya he, jo sajaa to puri kar chuke the lekin jurmaana naa bhar paane ke kaaran jail main band hai
 Ayush has paid a fine of about 27 thousand rupees from the scholarship amount and now on the morning of August 15, all these 14 prisoners will be able to breathe in the open air from the jail

 diji jail sanjay choudhary kaa kahana he ki vaise to kai sansthaaen hoti hai jo jurmaana kii rakam dekar jaruratmand kaidiyon kii madad karti ai hai
 However, it is truly praiseworthy to release prisoners by donating scholarship to a 14-year-old school child
 auto driver kii beti ko mili scolership, videsh main karegi padhaiayush kaa kahana he ki wo bhavishya main bhi jaruratmand kaidiyon kii aise hi madad karata rahegaa

 The biggest problem of this sector is expensive debt

 At present, the loans and home loan rates of this sector are only slightly below their highest levels
 developers kaa bhi maananaa he ki karj kaa boj keval industry states milane se hi kam ho sakegaa

 All the clearances are available online
 iskaa sidhaa faaydaa ye he ki behad kam vakt main project par kaam shuru ho jaataa he or paardarshita bhi bad jaati he
 Developers are in demand to implement it nationwide
 tex ke boj tale real estate industry bhi buree tarah dabi hui he
 The developers are in demand that the government should also look into this
 jiesti yani guds and services tex lagu kiya jaae
 This will not result in repeated taxation on the same thing
 ek hi baar tex chukaane se paardarshita bhi badhegi
 With the introduction of GST, it may be possible to reduce the prices of houses

 At present, the option to raise money through this route is only for affordable housing

 siraaj, navdeep saini, raajaneesh gurbani Communal riots have erupted in Kishtwar area of jammu and Kashmir since Eid
 bijepi samet kai vipakshi dal mukhyamantri umr abdulla kii barkhaastagi kii baat kar rahe hai, to palatwaar karte hue abdulla bijepi ko gujarat dangon kii yaad dilaate hue dhongi bataa rahe hai
 Amidst all this, Omar spoke to the virtuous Prasoon Vajpayee till date
 is baatcheet ke dauraan umr ne kai baar aapa khoyaa
 Many times he used to flare at the cross question and said that you are a judge
 aap bhi padhein is baatcheet ko or samajhen umr ke bayanon ke mynesawalah ab kaise halaat hai jammu main?umrahfilhal na sirf kishtwar balki jammu provins main halaat aam taur par thik hai
 Tension prevailed with the police at one place in Kishtwar
 jaahir he ki jahaan exiaar hui vahaan giraftaar honi he
 So where police went, force was used there
 lekin donon community ke bich jo tanaav kaa maahaul tha, aaj vah nahin he
 Question: The Home Minister is saying that in many areas of Jammu, anti-india slogans are raised on the day of gambling
 
 
 umriigrih mantri thik kah rahe hai
 Generally, some people come out in these areas on the day of Zuma and on Eid, who give slogans against the country
 ye nai baat nahin he
 This cycle has been going on for 20-22 years
 ise aaj tak communal rukh nahin diya gaya
 But now it has happened
 iske peeche koun jimmedaar he
 Whose negligence has been done
 isaki jaanch ke liye nyaayik jaanch bithai he, sab saaf ho jayega
 Question: Are you saying that anti-country slogans are not new in Jammu? aap yahaan ke rahane waalon se puuchhie
 Here eight to ten people go out in these areas and sometimes give slogans and go back
 afjal guru kii faansee ke dauraan ye baat hui
 In 2010 or in 2008, the situation in Kashmir worsened, when such slogans were raised
 sawaldakya rajya kaa mukhyamantri hamen kai udhaaharan dekar yah bataa rahaa he ki desh ke khilaaf narebaaji koi nai baat nahin?umrandekhie aam taur par jammu main is tarah ke halaat nahin banate hai
 There is no tension between the two sects here
 kuch logon kaa baahar aana or mulk ke khilaaf naare dena nai baat nahin he
 It happens
 aap baar baar aise ek hi sawaal puch rahe hai, jaise mere upar mukadmaa chalaa rahe hon
 Question: Why did you mention the Gujarat riots defending the state government over these riots? Umar: Do people who are trying to teach me a lesson in Kashmir, not see their home? mere khyaal se to bilkul nahin aata
 Tell me who you resigned after 2002
 jo log mere home ministar ke peeche lage hue the, jinhone jammu main teen din se hadtaal karvaa rakhi thi
 What he did during the Gujarat riots
 sawaalh kya is tarah ke siyaasi sawaalon ke liye ye sahi vakt he?umrayikyon janaab
 You tell me when to lift
 kya maine ye baat sansad main uthaane kii koshish kii
 Did i bring the situation to the world through Twitter? ham chupchaap kaam kar rahe the
 Dealing with situation
 yahi front par lekar aae
 This happened when Sushma Swaraj spoke via Twitter
 kya maine jammu waalon se kaha ki 70 ghanton tak dukaan band rakhen
 Question: Today you are talking about Gujarat riots
 jab dange hue the, tab aap atal bihari ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar main mantri bane hue the, tab kuch kyon nahin kaha?umrajaaye sawaal aap us vakt ke vajeer e ajam atal bihari vaajapeyi sahab se puuchhie
 i am the only minister who had abstained on the resolution of Gujarat
 maine us vakt vaajapeyi ko apana istipha diya
 He told them clearly that i will not vote in your favor on this issue
 maine sansad main apni aawaaj buland kii
 So, i have the right to be right
 sawaalh aap istife kii baat kar rahe hai
 Fawari rioted in Gujarat in 2002
 aap july 2001 se disambar 2002 tak vaajapeyi sarkaar main mantri rahe
 
 
 Umar: Why are you reading my curriculum vitae? mujhe pataa he achche se ki main kab se kab tak mantri rahaa
 Yes of course i was with the government, but did not vote on the resolution
 lekin sarkaar ke saath bane rahe kyonki meraa istipha kabool nahin kiya
 What do you think
 yahaan log bevakoof hai
 They all know who people are trying to do on this issue
 sawaalh kishtwar dangon kii aag main jhulas rahaa tha or siem twitor par jirah kar rahe the?umriito na duun jawaab logon ko
 You people say that political parties should keep pace with people, talk to each other, we should be approachable
 jab ham hote hai to aap kehete ho ki kaam nahin kar rahe
 This is the era of mobiles, there is no need to sit in a separate room to do all this

 a resolution was passed by a consensus on the hanging of Bhagat Singh, demanding that the Queen of Britain (queen Elizabeth II) apologize for hanging the hero of the independence movement, as well as compensation to her family members
 unhone kaha ki bhagat singh ko pehle umrakaid kii sajaa di gai thi lekin baad main anya ‘managasaint maamle’ main maut kii sajaa di gai

 The palace, covered in ocher, yellow and yellow, is guarded by the police in Awadh
 taarikh he 28 july or hajaaron kii taadaad main gaanv kii janata apana kaam chhodkar mahal ke baahar 18 baras baad apni ‘rani’ or unki pehali patni 58 varshiya garima singh ko dekhne ke liye ikattha hui he
 The skies echo with the slogan, "queen you fight, we are with you
" ” rani mahal kii munder par prakat hoti hai or haath hilaakar janata kaa abhivadan karti hai
 On 25 July, the smoldering discord in Amethi royal family came to the surface suddenly
 pichley 18 saal se lakhanu main rah raheen garima achaanak subah-subah apane putr or purv amethi riyasat ke vaaris anant vikram singh, putravadhu or chhattisgarh ke akaltara rajgaraane kii beti shanbhavi, pautra adhiraj singh, badi beti or jhabua rajgaraane kii bahu mahima singh, choti beti or duungarpur rajgaraane kii bahu shaivya singh ko lekar ramnagar ilaake main maujuud amethi riyasat ke mahal bhupati bhawan pahunch gayi
 When Sanjay Singh's second wife and former MLA from Amethi assembly constituency Amita Singh's representative and the staff who supervised the palace, when they got information about the forced entry into the palace, these people also reached there with weapons
 anant se unki jhadap bhi hui
 Meanwhile, as soon as the information of Garima came to the palace, people from different sides came to support her
 achaanak unke bachaav main bheed ko aata dekh amita ke aadmi hawaii firing karte hue bhaag nikle
 After this, Anant filed 12 cases of amita at Amethi police station, alleging assault, indecency with women and taking them hostage
 agle din amita ke samarthakon ne bhi anant samet nau logon par lutpaat or mahal par avaidh kabje kaa mukadmaa darj karaayaa
 This was the first time in the history of the Amethi princely state, when a dispute related to inheritance came out of the boundary wall and came out on the road
 mahal ke rasookh ke aage police bhi puri tarah se tamashbin bani khadi hui thi
 On the other hand, the supporters of dignity are chalked and camped outside the palace for their protection
 (sanjay singh or amita singh)akut sampatti par varchasv kii ladayeesanjay singh is riyasat ko hajaar saal se bhi zyada puraani bataate hai
 But Rananjay Singh was the seventh king and legislator of Amethi
 unki shaadi sushamaa devi se hui thi
 King Rananjay Singh had no children
 1962 main unhone bhetua block ke ameyamaafee nivasee gaya baksh singh ke putr sanjay singh ko apana dattak putr ghoshit kiya tha
 At that time, he was studying in the fifth grade
 aaj amethi riyasat ke paas akut sampatti he
 Many institutions from primary to higher education and technical education are operating under the flag of this former princely state
 amethi ke alaava varanasi, sultanpur, mirzapur, lakhanu, dilli, sitapur samet kai mahanagaron main is purv riyasat kii sampatti he, jinaki keemat 500 karod ru
 Is more than that
 is riyasat kii ‘maharani’ garima takreeban 100 kamaron vaale bhupati bhawan kii pehali manzil par bane do chote-se kamaron main apane bacchon ke saath rah rahi hai
 The doors of the palace have been locked from inside for security
 kisi bahari aadmi ko mahal ke andar aane-jane kii manaahi he
 The people of this former princely state are taking care of the dignity and hunger and thirst of their children outside
 unke samarthak apane gharon se bhojan laakar baaltee bandhi rassi ke jariye mahal ke bheetar pahunchaa rahe hai
 Anant, the only son of Sanjay Singh, says, “amita Modi (amita Singh) has taken possession of all the wealth of the princely state after marrying Maharaj (sanjay Singh)
 meri maa aaj bhi maharaj kii byaahta patni or riyasat kii maharani hai
 Amita Modi will not be allowed to enter this palace at any cost for the right of mother
 ”talaak par uth rahe sawalilahabaad ke daiya rajgaraane ke raja or purv pradhanmantri vishwanath pratap singh ke chote bhai hari baksh singh kii putree garima kaa vivaah sanjay ke saath 1974 main hua tha
 Sanjay, who lives with Amita in a luxurious bungalow on Sardar Patel Marg in Lucknow Cantt, says, “I never got peace after marriage
 garima kii nigaah shuru se meri sampatti par thi
 Eventually i decided to divorce
 1995 main maine apane bacchon kii sahmati se amita se duusari shaadi karne kaa faisla kiya
 "actually Amita was the wife of the famous badminton player Syed Modi, who was assassinated in 1988 in Lucknow in broad daylight
 is sansanikhej hatyakand main sanjay ke saath amita kaa bhi naam aayaa tha, lekin 1993 main supreme court ne donon ko bari kar diya
 After this, Sanjay filed a divorce case with dignity in a court in Sitapur and he got it within a few days
 is puri prakriya par sawalia nishaan lagaate hue garima kahati hai, “sanjay singh ne meri jagah duusari aurat ko court main pesh kar talaak hasil kiya tha
 This was a big fraud
 maine talaak ke kisi bhi kaagaj par hastakshar nahin kiye the
 At that time, i was in Lucknow and i came to know from the newspaper that i and they had been divorced
 ” garima ke mutabik, hycourt or uske baad supreme court bhi is talaak ko avaidh ghoshit kar chukaa he
 When Garima reached Bhupathi Bhavan on January 28, 1996 after Sanjay's marriage to Ameeta, it was her son Anant and daughter Mahima who prevented her from entering the palace
 bacchon ke virodh se sakate main ai garima lakhanu waapas aa gayi or uske baad dobaaraa mahal kii ore nahin dekha
 Mahima, who lived with her husband in the city of San Francisco, USA, is also present in Bhupathi Mahal
 maa ke virodh karne kaa zikr chhidate hi unki ankhen aansuon se dabdba jaati hai
 Wiping the tears, Mahima says, "maharaj and Ameeta Modi have explained to us from the beginning that my mother and maternal grandfather Amethi are occupying the princely state
 ham unki baton main aakar maa ko hi galat maan baithe the
 ”(sanjay Singh's younger daughter Shaivya Singh, first wife Garima Singh, son Anant Vikram Singh and elder daughter Mahima) Baghavati born of neglect, glorifying the stack of pictures of princely ancestors in a small room in the Tevarbhupati palace Suddenly, you get stung
 budhu maharaj (sanjay ke pita raja rannjay singh) kii ek tasviir se dhul hataate hue ve kahati hai, “amita ne riyasat ke purvajon kaa apmaan karne ke saath-saath mahal kii garima ko bhi thes pahunchaai he
 "actually Sanjay used to look after all the wealth of the princely state before marrying Amita, but after marriage, Amita took over this responsibility
 bacchon kaa aarope he ki amita ke prabhaav main aakar hi sanjay ne unki upeksha kii
 Anant, working in the Merchant Navy, left his job in 2011 for the same family reasons and started living with his mother in Lucknow
 pichhali 18 june ko ve apni patni or bacchon ke saath lakhanu se aakar amethi ke mahal main rahane lage
 After Dadia's mother-in-law died in the second week of July, when he went to Chhattisgarh along with his family, his luggage was sent by truck from the palace to Lucknow
 iske baad garima ne putr ko uskaa haq dilaane ke liye 18 varsh baad amethi aane kaa faisla kiya
 Garima says, "this is a battle of rights
" main maharaj kii patni hum
 There was no heat on them, so it was still silent
 lekin ab bacchon kaa dukh mujhase saha nahin jaataa
 Children have to give their rights
 ”garima or anant ke saare aaropon se bephikr sanjay kehete hai, “anant hi meraa uttaradhikari he
 Garima has misled the son in the greed for property
 ” philhal riyasat kii viraasat kii yah jang aaropon-pratyaropon ke tir se hi ladi ja rahi he, lekin isane donon pakshon kii pratishtha ko jamkar chot pahunchaai he
 Like a Bollywood film story, this highvoltage family drama has made the Amethi royalty a scandal among the public
