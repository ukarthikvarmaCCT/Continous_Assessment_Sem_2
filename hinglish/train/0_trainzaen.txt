 Prior to the meeting, the BJP delegation met President Pranab Mukherjee and demanded imposition of President's rule in the state, saying that Chief Minister Harish Rawat had no right to continue in the post after the sting operation

 Rebel mlas of the Congress today alleged that they have been offered bribes by the Chief Minister to support him during the power test in the House on March 28

 Dhasal has changed the politics of the country
 bharat main aisa koi or kavi nahin hua
 Like Dhasal, no poet in the world has created a radical political organization like Dalit Panther
 ab jabaki dhasaal nahin rahe, hamen ek baar dalit panther kii bhoomika kaa simhavlokan kar lenaa chahie
 Four decades ago, when Naxalism was spreading fear among the privileged section of the eastern part of India, on July 9, 1972, 23-year-old Dhasal in western India established a vicious organization like Shaldit Panthery

 After Ambedkar, the ignominy of the insult awakened the Bodhunya Dalit community

 Just a month after the establishment of the Dalit Panther, Dhasal announced — if the Legislative Assembly or Parliament would not solve the problems of ordinary people, the Panthers would burn them to ashes — which stirred up the ruling parties
 dalit panther kii prerana unhen america ke blike panther andolan se mili thi jo ashweton ko unke maanviya, saamaajik, aarthik va rajnatik adhikaar dilaane ke liye 1966 se sangharshrat tha

 unhone daliton ko sarvhaara parivartankami veg kii pahchaan pradaan kii tathaa unke sangharsh ko duniya ke anya damit logon ke sangharsh se jod diya
 It is not possible to ignore the achievements of Dalit Panther in the expansion of Dalit literature

 The Joint Committee on the Bill also deferred the bill for the next session
 notebandi ke baad se cashles arthvyavastha ke vichaar kaa shrey lene waalon kii kami nahin hai
 Many names came up, his interview was printed, many mps made themselves mobile mobile wallet campaigners
 lekin kya aapako pataa he ki mobile baking mobile wolet kaa idia kiskaa he? urisa ke bolangir zile kaa ek kasbaa he titalgarh
 It was here that Sam Pitroda applied for a patent for a digital wallet in the US in 1994
 1996 main pitroda ke digital wolet ko patent mil gaya
 20-20 years ago, Indian politics was sitting on the bullock cart and opposing the computer, even today there is something similar, but the real hero of the digital wallet is missing
 anek prakaar kii mobile wolet companiyon kaa vigyaapan rose chap rahaa he, deshbhakti se otprot he inke vigyaapan lekin kya yah ajeeb nahin he ki jin vigyaapan kaa naaraa deshbhakti se ranga hua tha, unheen naaron main isaki kalpana karne vaale ek bhartiya kaa naam gaayab tha
 Don't those companies know that digital wallet was conceived by Sam Pitroda
 raajnneeti or bazaar bahut chaturaai se deshbhakti or rashtrawaad kaa istemaal karte hai
 So there is no harm in thinking for a minute
 hamen bhi isaki jaankaree nahin thi, lekin purv banker vibhaas shrivastav ji ke hindi main likhe lekh se isaki soochna mili
 In 2010, Sam Pitroda and Mehul Desai also wrote a book
 kitaab kaa naam he 'di march of mobile mani
 This book describes the journey and future of mobile banking
 mehul desai kii ek or kitaab he di quest for cashles sosayadi bhi ek kitaab he jo 2015 main chhapi thi
 We tried to contact Sam Pitroda but could not succeed
 pitroda ne 2010 main kaha tha ki 30 saal main paper mani yaa note gaayab ho jayega
 If this is true, then one of these fifty days of demonetisation can be celebrated as Sam Pitroda Day or Sam Mark can be started for e-wallet, like hall mark on jewelry
 sam mark kaa idia hamaare sahyogi amitesh kaa he
 According to the order of the Reserve Bank, it should be written in the branch of every bank, who is its internal ombudsman, how will the contact be done
 yah lokapal duusare bainkon se ritred hua vyakti banataa he
 Banks have their own ombudsman, all banks also have an independent ombudsman
 bainkon ke bhi i wolet hote hai or companiyon ke bhi
 Wallets of banks come under the purview of Lokpal, but e-wallets of companies do not come under the purview of Lokpal
 agar yah sahi he to aisa kyon he
 Demonetisation has provided an opportunity for both the viewer and the journalist to understand the banking system
 mere padhane or samajhane main chook ho sakati he, iske liye pehle hi maafee
 Still i am taking the risk of sharing what i understand
 rigerv bank ke anusaar i-wolet se aapane kisi ko bhugtan kiya
 Money should be deposited in the account of the person who has paid within three days
 maan lijie ki paisa nahin gaya or aapke khate se nikal gaya
 So what is the independent mechanism for its complaint
 maan lijie ki aapane khate se paisa nikal gaya or raste main kahin atak gaya
 It is obvious that you will complain to the wallet company itself
 agar teen din ke andar company ne paisa nahin diya, chaar din baad diya yaa haftaa bhar pataa chalaa ki aapane jo pement kiya tha wo bijli vaale ko mila hi nahin to aap kya karenge
 The Reserve Bank allows wallet companies to earn the interest on their minimum deposits
 ho saktaa he ki koi company aapkaa paisa roak kar byaaz kama le or udhar samay par pement na karne ke kaaran aapako jurmaana bharna pad jaae

 We cannot confirm this but it was heard that the rent of this office is 30-35 lakh rupees a month
 itnaa kharchaa kiraaye par or faisle ke liye saadhe paanch saal se jaj nahin
 Whose accountability is this? vaise ye tribunel ravishankar prasad ke ai tii mantralay ke tahat aata he

 We may be wrong in the legal understanding, but you will file an FIR in the criminal case
 magar paisa chahie to nimnlikhit charnon se guzarate hue aapako uparokt sibar tribunel hi aana hoga
 You will first appeal to the Adjudicating Officer of the state
 har rajya ke soochna technolji mantralay kaa sachiv Adjudicating afasar hota he
 If you go directly to the High Court, then the matter is sent to the tribunal itself
 somvaar ke 'prime time' main prashanth mali ne kaha ki kai rajyon main pradhan sachivon ko Adjudicating afasar kaa daayitv notiphoi nahin kiya gaya he
 We could not confirm it from our side
 agar yah sahi he to sibar aparaadh ko lekar insaaf kii vyavastha kaaphi andhkaar main he
 There is a severe lack of awareness, probably because there are only around 100 cases, while in February 2016, Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told the Rajya Sabha that between April and December 2015, there were 12,000 cases of bank fraud
 rashtriya aparaadh shakha ke anusaar 2013 main sibar krime ke 4,356 maamle or 2014 main 7,021 maamle darj hue the
 On Monday, a report came out that fraudulent cases could increase 60-65 per cent due to cashless campaign
 computer immergency rispance team cert-in ke anusaar 2015 main tamaam tarah ke sibar aparaadhon kii sankhya 49,455 thi
 The comments gair nakadi len-dein ke maamle main asia ke mulk tezi se pragati kar rahe hai
 The world-renowned bank BNP Paribas and Management Consulting Corporation Cape Gemini released the World Payments Report 2016
 iske anusaar 2014 main This trend of cashless transactions in the world 8
 9% kii dar se badha
 China grew at the rate of 40 percent and India 13
 5 pratishat kii dar se
 China ranks fourth in terms of cashless transactions
 pehla america he, doosraa euro zone he, teesraa brazil he
 In this case, India is not among the top ten countries
 is report ke anusaar teraa saal se check se bhugtan gata he
 The trend of cash payment is also becoming less
 is report main bhi kaha gaya he ki jis tezi se cashles chalan badha he us tezi se niyamon main badlaav nahin aa rahaa he
 Banks have to improve risk management
 yah bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga ki niyamon kaa jaal itnaa jatil na ho jaae ki upabhokta kii pareshaani bad jaae
 Are we aware of our rights as a consumer? maan lijie ki kisi ne hack kar aapke khate se das lakh uda liye
 Capital of a lifetime was cleared, so where would you complain, what legal rights do you have
 raajnneeti or bazaar bahut chaturaai se deshbhakti or rashtrawaad kaa istemaal karte hai
 So there is no harm in thinking for a minute
 hamen bhi isaki jaankaree nahin thi, lekin purv banker vibhaas shrivastav ji ke hindi main likhe lekh se isaki soochna mili
 In 2010, Sam Pitroda and Mehul Desai also wrote a book
 kitaab kaa naam he 'di march of mobile mani
 This book describes the journey and future of mobile banking
 mehul desai kii ek or kitaab he di quest for cashles sosayadi bhi ek kitaab he jo 2015 main chhapi thi
 We tried to contact Sam Pitroda but could not succeed
 pitroda ne 2010 main kaha tha ki 30 saal main paper mani yaa note gaayab ho jayega
 If this is true, then one of these fifty days of demonetisation can be celebrated as Sam Pitroda Day or Sam Mark can be started for e-wallet, like hall mark on jewelry
 sam mark kaa idia hamaare sahyogi amitesh kaa he
 According to the order of the Reserve Bank, it should be written in the branch of every bank, who is its internal ombudsman, how will the contact be done
 yah lokapal duusare bainkon se ritred hua vyakti banataa he
 Banks have their own ombudsman, all banks also have an independent ombudsman
 bainkon ke bhi i wolet hote hai or companiyon ke bhi
 Wallets of banks come under the purview of Lokpal, but e-wallets of companies do not come under the purview of Lokpal
 agar yah sahi he to aisa kyon he
 Demonetisation has provided an opportunity for both the viewer and the journalist to understand the banking system
 mere padhane or samajhane main chook ho sakati he, iske liye pehle hi maafee
 Still i am taking the risk of sharing what i understand
 rigerv bank ke anusaar i-wolet se aapane kisi ko bhugtan kiya
 Money should be deposited in the account of the person who has paid within three days
 maan lijie ki paisa nahin gaya or aapke khate se nikal gaya
 So what is the independent mechanism for its complaint
 maan lijie ki aapane khate se paisa nikal gaya or raste main kahin atak gaya
 It is obvious that you will complain to the wallet company itself
 agar teen din ke andar company ne paisa nahin diya, chaar din baad diya yaa haftaa bhar pataa chalaa ki aapane jo pement kiya tha wo bijli vaale ko mila hi nahin to aap kya karenge
 The Reserve Bank allows wallet companies to earn the interest on their minimum deposits
 ho saktaa he ki koi company aapkaa paisa roak kar byaaz kama le or udhar samay par pement na karne ke kaaran aapako jurmaana bharna pad jaae
 Do we understand the nuances of all laws and our rights
 somvaar ke 'prime time' main vakil prashanth mali ne kaha ki dilli ke sibar apellette tribunel main 2012 se koi jaj nahin he
 We were shocked to hear this
 hamaare sahyogi sharad sharma mangalvaar subah dilli sthit sibar apellette tribulan ke daftar pahunch gaye
 This is the only court for cyber crime in India
 jaise paryaavaran ke liye neshnal green tribunel he, lekin engiti yaa duusare tribunel main ek chairman or do member hote hai
 If there is no chairman in the NGT, the member can enhance the judicial process
 iti kanoon 2000 main aisa koi praavdhaan na hone ke kaaran beete saadhe paanch saal se sibar tribunel main tarikh hi milti he, faisla nahin aata
 Because its members cannot act as judges
 vaise ye jaj nahin prisiding afasar kahe jate hai magar isaki kursi par koi ritred nyaayadhish hi baithta he
 Justice Rajesh Tandon was the last judge of this tribunal
 30 june, 2011 se vahaan jaj nahin hai
 Sharad Sharma also visited the tribunal's website, which shows that there has been no Judgment here since 2011
 iskaa daftar conot place ke jivan bharti building ke ground floor main he
 We cannot confirm this but it was heard that the rent of this office is 30-35 lakh rupees a month
 itnaa kharchaa kiraaye par or faisle ke liye saadhe paanch saal se jaj nahin
 Whose accountability is this? vaise ye tribunel ravishankar prasad ke ai tii mantralay ke tahat aata he
 The Ministry has not given enough staff here
 isaki website par likhaa he ki chairman kii niyukti sarkaar ke paas vichaaradhin he
 This is the condition of the only court in India for cybercrime
 sibar vakil pawan duggal ji ne kaha ki jaj kaa na hona ek tarah se maanavadhikaar kaa hanan he
 Sharad Sharma went to his office to meet lawyer Sajal Dhamija, who was fighting the case in this tribunal
 farz kiijie ki aap tamilnadu ke kisi kasbe se hai or aapke saath sibar frod hota he
 We may be wrong in the legal understanding, but you will file an FIR in the criminal case

 agar ye baat aksharsh: sahi he to notebandi ke in pachaas dinon main se koi ek din sam pitroda diwas ke rup main manaaya ja saktaa he yaa phir gahanon par lagane vaale haul mark kii tarah i-wolet ke liye sam mark shuru ho saktaa he
 Sam Mark's idea is from our colleague Amitesh
 reserve bank ke aadesh ke anusaar har bank ke branch main yah likhaa hona chahie ki uskaa aantarik lokapal koun he, sampark kaise hoga
 This Lokpal becomes a person retired from other banks
 bainko kaa apana lokapal to hota hi he, sabhi bainkon kaa bhi ek swatantra lokapal hota he
 Banks also have e-wallets and also companies
 bainkon ke wolet to lokapal ke daayre main aate hai, lekin companiyon ke i-wolet lokapal ke daayre main nahin aate
 If this is correct then why is this so
 notebandi ne darshak or patrkaar donon ko baking pranali ko samajhane kaa avasar uplabdh karaayaa he
 i may have missed reading and understanding, sorry for that already
 phir bhi jo samaj sakaa hum wo saajha karne kaa jokhim uthaa rahaa hum
 According to the Reserve Bank, you paid someone with an e-wallet
 jise pement kiya he uske khate main teen din ke andar paisa chalaa janaa chahie
 Suppose the money did not go away and was removed from your account
 to isaki shikaayat ke liye swatantra vyavastha kya he
 Suppose you have withdrawn money from the account and got stuck somewhere along the way
 zaahir he isaki shikaayat aapako wolet company se hi karenge
 If within three days the company did not give the money, after four days, or after a week it was found that the payment you had made was not received by the electrician, then what will you do
 rigerv bank wolet compinyon ko anumati detaa he ki ve apni nunatam jamaa raashi par wo byaaz kama sakati hai
 It is possible that a company earns interest by withholding your money and you have to pay penalty due to non-payment on time

 On the return of Ajit Jogi's No Entry Ajit Jogi, Rahul Gandhi made it clear that now there is no possibility of the former Chief Minister Jogi returning to the Congress again nor will there be any alliance with Jogi's party
 unhone aage kaha ki kisi bhi party se gathbandhan uske damakham se hota he
 In this context, discussions are going on in alliance and seat sharing with BSP in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh
 unhone bataaya ki uttar pradesh main congress kaa alag gathbandhan ban rahaa he
 It includes some smaller teams including SP and BSP
 yah gathbandhan mahagathbandhan se alag hoga
 Through this alliance, the BJP plans to wipe out parliamentary seats from big states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh
 sitambar tak hogi ghoshnachhattisgarh main tikat vitaran ko lekar rahul gandhi ne pehle elaan kiya tha ki 15 agast se pehle vah aadhi se zyada siton par apane ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kar denge, lekin aaj unhone saaf kiya ki ab sitambar ke ant tak sabhi ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kar di jaaegi
 However, he also said that half the candidates have been decided, the rest are in the process
 rafel saude par rahul ek baar phir centre sarkaar par hamalavar hue or unhone bijepi par tikhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha ki wo bhrashtachar se achhuti nahin he
 PM Modi is buying the airplane that was negotiated by the UPA government for only 540 crores for 1,600 crores
 wo bhi puraane saude ko radd kiye bagaiyr
 When Rahul Gandhi was asked that he was asking the NDA government for four years
 duusari ore, bijepi unase saath saal kaa hisaab kitaab maang rahi he, jis par congress adhyaksh kuch der ke liye chup ho gaye
 Then he whipped Modi and Amit Shah
 rahul gandhi ne puraane muddon or maamalon ko chhodkar nae masalon par charchaa karne kii baat kar kai aise chubte hue sawaalo ko taal diya
 Rahul Gandhi came to Raipur to inaugurate Rajiv Bhavan, the new headquarters of the Congress, but before leaving for Delhi, he also discussed with a delegation of businessmen, industrialists and doctors besides journalists
 saath hi party ke sthaneey netaaon se bhi mili
 The fate of Budget 2012-13 was decided in Lucknow instead of Delhi
 6 march kii dopaher main jab yah saaf ho gaya ki samaajawaadee party (sapa) ko uttar pradesh main sarkaar banane ke liye congress ke samarthan kii jarurat nahin hogi, uske baad se hi north block sthit vitt mantralay main arthshaastreey jaruraton par rajnatik vaastaviktaaen haaavee ho gayi
 a finance ministry official says, "pranab Mukherjee knew from the same day that the Congress would not have the necessary numbers to pass a bold, reformist budget
 vitt mantri chaukas or paramparawaadi vyakti hai
 They decided to wait until they agreed
 ’buree tarah vibhajit raajnneeti main sahmati bana paanaa asambhav ho saktaa he
 In practice, the big finance ministry officials are just hoping that the UPA government will get Mulayam Singh Yadav's strong support from the SP in the next two months
 ek adhikari kehete hai, ‘pramukh sudhaaron par sapa ke saath kisi samjhaute ke liye 6 march or 16 march ke bich zyada samay nahin tha
 'it is likely that 23 SP mps in UPA will compensate for 19 mps of Mamata Banerjee
 aakhir mamata banerjee to kisi haal main kisi sudhaarwadi kanoon kaa samarthan nahin karengi
 So far SP has given mixed signals to UPA
 usne vivaadit neshnal counter terarysm centre (ensitisi) par sarkaar ko bachaaya he
 But Mulayam has ruled out joining the UPA government 'so close to election'
 'kareeb' shabd sambhawatah upie ke paas baaki bache do saal se kahin zyada najadik samay kaa ishaara karata he
 Perhaps the reform the Congress could have implemented without any hindrance is to rationalize government spending and especially subsidies
 upie sarkaar apane sansadhano se zyada kharch karti rahi he, usee tarah jaise 1980 ke dashak kii congress sarkarein karti thim
 The country almost went bankrupt in 1991
 is samay bhi agar sankat nahin to mushkil sthiti jarur he
 According to the budget presented on 16 March, the fiscal deficit (5% of GDP in 2011-12)
 9 pratishat par pahunch gaya he, jabaki bajet 2011 main iskaa anumaan 4
 Was 8 percent
 sarkari ghate se pataa chalata he ki sarkaar apni aamadani kii tulana main kitna zyada kharch kar rahi he
 The high government deficit means that the government is harming the more efficient private sector by seizing a large share of the available resources in the economy
 yah aarthik vikaas ke liye bura he
 About one-third of this deficit (about two percent of GDP) goes towards subsidies for food, fertilizer and fuel
 vitt mantralay maanata he ki kharch or sabsidi par bharosemand sudhaaron kaa sanket dene ke liye is bajet main kaaphi kadam uthaae hai
 One of its officials says, "we have reduced the government deficit to 5 in 2012-13
 1 pratishat par neeche laane kaa vaada kiya he
 The Finance Minister has made a bold announcement to impose a maximum limit of two percent of GDP on subsidy
 ’ abhi sabsidi kaa str jidipi ke 2
 Is at 2 percent
 sabhi log nahin maanate ki kharch or sabsidi par sarkari anumaan bharosemand hai
 Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said on March 16 at the India Today Conclave, "I am not convinced that the two percent limit is a practical step
" pichley saal sarkaar ne 1
 43 lakh crore Rs
 kii sabsidi dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 But the actual expenses 2
 16 lakh karod ru
 Happened to bajet main tay raashi se yah puure 70,000 karod ru
 Is more
 ’ jetali kii baat main dam he
 When the government has gone 50 percent ahead of its fixed subsidy target last year, then the limit of two percent in the coming fiscal year is just pseudo-covering and jargon of data, this is not a real improvement
 sarkaar ke ghate kaa ganit bahut-si manyataon par tikaa he or in sabakaa sach hona pakkaa nahin he
 Regarding the revenue, it has assumed that Rs 40,000 crore from the auction of the canceled 2G licenses
 milenge
 Given the financial condition of all telecom companies, it may not be possible to get this amount
 piesu vinievesh se sarkaar ne 2012-13 main 30,000 karod ru
 Is expected to get agar oengisi ke haal ke pit gaye vinievesh se koi sanket len, jisamen kul 13,000 karod ru
 11,000 crore out of the sale of shares of Rs
 to elisi ne hi die, to vinievesh se 30,000 karod ru
 The goal of achieving seems ambitious
 kharch ke morche par sarkari akalan tabhi sahi honge, jab tel sabsidi bajet main tay 40,000 karod ru
 Do not go beyond sarkaar kaa pichhlaa record bharosa nahin jagaata
 It spent only Rs 20,000 crore in the budget in the name of oil subsidy in 2011-12
 rakhe the, lekin vaastavik kharch 60,000 karod ru
 Is done ek adhikari bataate hai, ‘agar tel kii antarrashtriya keemat 115 dollar (5,750 ru
 ) Exceeds the barrel, then this math of the government may deteriorate
 ’anaupchaarik baatcheet main vitt mantralay ke adhikari maanate hai ki tel sabsidi ke aankade tabhi sahi honge, jab sarkaar dijal kii keemat par niyantran hataa le
 To do this, it will need the support of the SP
 kisaan dijal kaa kaaphi prayog karte hai, jo sapa kaa mukhya janaadhar he
 It does not seem possible to completely remove control
 sabsidi kii seemaa ke saath-saath sarkari ghate kaa lakshya aasaani se bikhar saktaa he
 Foreign investment is an important area of economic reforms
 sarkaar ne is bare main mahaj jubaani jamaakharch kiya
 The finance minister consolidated foreign direct investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail in just one paragraph
 is par 2011 main jo gatirodh bana, usase aage koi kadam nahin badhaayaa ja sakaa he
 FDI in airlines was mentioned in just one sentence
 is par charchaa karne kii baat kahi gai, jabaki ise ek niti ke rup main ghoshit kiya ja saktaa tha
 Unlike FDI in multibrand retail, FDI in airlines is not an emotional political issue
 is par samarthan jutaya ja saktaa he
 Top officials of the Finance Ministry are expressing satisfaction that FDI has been mentioned in the minister's speech
 ek adhikari ne kaha, ‘agar ham ise aage badhaane ke icchhuk nahin hote to bhaashan se ise puri tarah hataa bhi sakate the
 However, the weak attempt by the Finance Minister to favor FDI in his speech was erased by a very regressive section of the Finance Bill
 isamen desh ke tex niyamon main ateet se lagu sanshodhan kiya gaya, jisase sarkaar ko bharat se baahar kii do companiyon ke bich hone vaale videshi saudon main bhi tex lagane kii shakti mil jaae, basharte saude main shaamil sampatti bharat main sthit ho
 Just four days after the budget, on March 20, the Supreme Court re-affirmed its January 20 ruling, which ordered it not to tax India in the vodafone-hutch deal
 isane apane us faisle kii samiksha ke liye sarkaar kii yachika radd kar di
 But when the finance bill becomes law, the court will be forced to change its mind
 yah sanshodhan jab paarit ho jayega, to sarkaar britain kii telecom company vodaphone par 11,000 karod ru
 k would claim capital gains tax even though both Vodafone and Hutch were companies outside India at the time of the deal
 tex kanoon main is mahatvapurn sanshodhan se sarkaar kuch duusare seemaa-paar saudon par 54 karod dollar (2,700 karod ru
 ) Tax
 sarkaar ke is kadam par vaazib taur par chautarafa aalochana hui
 Dinesh Kanabar, deputy CEO of consultancy firm QPMG and chairman of the tax practice division, says, "all the deals that could have been taxed are already before the court
" sarkaar kahati he ki vah in sabhi saudon par tex se lagbhag 30,000 karod ru
 Will be able to raise vitt mantri ko is sankhya kaa gyaan kaise hua?’ dinesh ke mutabik is baat kii kaaphi sambhaavna he ki is sanshodhan ko adaalat main chunauti di jaaegi
 But not many such occasions have come before this, when the courts have repealed such amendments
 pricewaterhousakupers ke joint tex leader kethan dalal kehete hai, ‘ateet se lagu sanshodhan niveshkon ke man main gambhir anischitata paidaa karte hai
 These have a bad effect on the credibility of the government

 But in the meantime, the family decided Dinesh's marriage elsewhere
 dinesh kii shaadi 31 march ko honi thi, lekin shaadi se do din pehle usne apni premika ko bulaayaa or ekbar phir uske saath shaareerik sambandh banaae
 His girlfriend got the news about his marriage on the wedding day itself

 On the complaint of the victim, when the accused groom made a mobile callcheck, the entire case was revealed
 darasal dinesh kaa 2016 se hi peedita ke saath prem prasang chal rahaa tha or shaadi kaa jhansa dekar dinesh ne uske saath shaareerik sambandh bhi sthapit kar liye the

 yahaan tak ki, wo is baar congress party ke sadsy tak nahin bane
 In such a situation, the media should not take that which is not even a member of Congress

 Poonawala is often seen defending the party on TV channels
 shahzad ne kaha tha ki congress main adhyaksh pad kaa chunaav nahin chayan ho rahaa he or sabakuch fiks he
 The committee is formed in such a way that the name of Rahul Gandhi is to be stamped

 maut zindagi kaa aakhri sach he
 a truth that no one can deny
 magarmautakab aegi
 How will it come
 kis vakt aegi
 Where will you come ye koi nahin jaanata
 But sometimes the way sudden death comes, it is not sure
 yakeen aae bhi to aae kaise? kisi ko naachte-naachte maut aa gai
 So someone died while talking
 kisi ko itani khushi mili ki achaanak saansen tham gayi
 So someone got such a shock that the beats stopped
 ye aisa akelaa maamla nahin he
 Such incidents have also come up before

 But in the 13th second, God tied his breath

 In fact, in Lalji Pada, Kandivali west of Mumbai, 'CM Chakshak' program was going on since last 23 November, in which a dance program was organized

 He rode a mare as a groom
 uske yaar dost naach ga rahe the
 The groom was so happy in his marriage that he climbed his friend's shoulder and danced openly

 He was going to get the award that suddenly he fell there and life left him

 Death in marriage is a matter of Rajasthan

 He was also in arms

 There was an event going on in the city of death while strolling in the program

 'an elderly couple were dancing to the same song
 dekhne vaale taaliyaan baja rahe the
 But then, the elderly man had a heart attack while dancing and his body became cold as he danced
 unki tasveeron ko dekhakar ehsaas hota he ki maut kaa bharosa katai nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Because she never comes by telling
 ye maut he
 It does not take appointments from anyone
 ye to sab jaanate hai ki zindagi or maut to bas uuparavaale ke haath main he
 No one knows when and who will rise
 maut kahin bhi
 Anytime
 
 Anyone can come
 bhale wo 73 saal saal kaa buzurg ho yaa 13 saal kii maasoom

 kya hoga agar ek hi class main skool ke topper or phelior ko saath-saath baitha diya jaae? ye jaanane ke liye aapako kuch khaas intjaar nahin karnaa padegaa
 Director Nikhil Advani and producer Siddharth Roy Kapur are asking the public the only question that they have formed in their upcoming film 'katti Batti', thinking about the pairing of Queen Kangna Ranot of Bollywood and Imran Khan, who are constantly failing
 
 problem:maasoom or chocolati boy imran khan ke kariyar main 'lav stories' kii rekha par rahu, ketu or shani baithe hai or upar se mangal baari he
 People have even started saying that if Imran did not come to give expressions and dance, then he could make a good career in modeling
 lekin ab film industry main agar aa gaye hai to kuch nayaa experiment kyon nahin karte? har film kii ek hi tipical lav story kii kulfi, us story kii kulfi ke thele (ladki) ke peeche bacchon kii tarah bhaagate imran, or aakhir main vahi dhak ke teen paat! har film main imran hi ladki ke peeche pagalaae rahete hai, or ladki unhen bhav nahin detii
 After the release of the film, it is learned that all the footage also took the heroine
 imran kaa kariyar vaise kaa vaisaa
 Chance in Career: Imran played Child Artist in 1988 in 'qayamat Se Qayamat Tak' and in 1992 'jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar'
 uske baad 2008 main 'jane tu yaa jane naa' se debyue kar filmphere aword for best new qamar se bhi navaaje gaye
 Kiamir Khan's nephew has become all round
 sabko hilaakar rakh degaa
 Who knew that everyone would be seen shaking their hair in the theater instead of moving? 'kidnap', 'luck', 'ek Main Aur Ek Tu', 'matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola', 'once Upon a Time in Mumbai Again' and 'gori Tere Pyaar Mein', how many such opportunities did Imran get, but the pictures all flopped
 'ai het lav stories', 'brake ke baad', 'mere brother kii dulhan' or 'dely baili' jaisi kuch chuninda hits bhi ain
 But in most of the films, the heroine ate up all the footage
 ek samay to aisa aayaa jab filmon main sonam kapur se lekar karina kapur or deepika padukon tak har actress ne unhen lattu kii tarah nachaaya or apana apana kariyar set kar liya
 Now in September 2015, Kanganase in 'katti Batti' are all expecting the same
 koi fain imran kaa bura nahin chahta
 But why do they sign such films in which they are being told that 'brother, that girl is not right for you
 wo sirf tere saath timopas kar tuje bevakoof bana rahi he
 'why don't Imran's other relatives or benevolent people explain this to him? Why does Emraan always sign such films in which he is shown running after the girl? Why do they avoid comedy, action, etc
 Will there be a film that Imran will prove to be a hit on his own? To say that, Emraan also did a film making course from Los Angeles' New York Film Academy
 lekin uskaa bhi koi phayda yahaan nahin dikhataa
 Imran proved that there is no gas in the layer shot deodorant
 bas ab ek aakhri chota sa kaam bachaa he apana filmi kariyar bachaana
 So sorry Imran !! madhya pradesh vidhansabha main shuukravaar ko jamkar hangaamaa hua

 vikaas ke maamle kaaphi peeche chhot gaya he
 BJP president Amit Shah also inaugurated an exhibition of photographs of party workers in Kannur
 kerala kii vampanthi sarkaar ke khilaaf bijepi ne puri tarah se qamar kas liya he or jamini par sangharsh karne ke liye aaj se utar rahi he

 is tandav ke khilaaf bijepi padayatra karegi
 He said that 120 people have been killed in Kerala so far
 khud CM ke kshetra main 84 hatya hui hai
 CPM has become Maoist in Kerala
 isiilie is yatra ko bijepi ne jansuraksha yatra naam diya gaya he
 He traveled in 11 districts of Kerala, he said that BJP has got 15 percent votes in Kerala, but further it is going to be 30 percent
 yahi vajah he ki rajya sarkaar baukhala gai he
 But we will not be afraid
 is yatra kii aguwai bijepi pradesh adhyaksh kummanam rajasekharan karenge
 The yatra will pass through 11 out of 14 districts of Kerala
 gauratlab he ki sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat dwaara kerala sarkaar par jihadi evam raashtra virdohi takaton kaa samarthan karne kaa aarope lagane ke baad mukhyamantri pinaraai vijayan ne kerala ke marxvaadi netaaon kii maovadiyon se tulana karne ko lekar aaj maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri prakaash jaavdekar ko aade haath liya
 Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that Union ministers should follow the principle of federal structure
 unhone kaha ki bijepi netaa aisi tippanee isliye kar rahe hai, kyonki dakshini rajya main sangh kaa agenda lagu nahin ho paa rahaa he
 BJP and Sangh people are stunned
 vijayan ne baad main ek fasebuk post main kaha ki bhaajapa ke mantriyon aurasang ke netaaon ko kerala ko badanamakarne se bachanaa chahie
 He said that Shah and BJP leaders should ask their supporters why the DYFI worker was killed
 darasal makapa kii yuva shakha diviefai ke ek kaaryakarta kii pichley saal 11 july ko hatya kar di gai thi makapa mahasachiv kodiari baalkrishnan ne bhi jaavdekar ko aade haath lete hue kaha ki unhen adhyayan karnaa chahie ki marxvad kya he

 chunaav vaale rajyon main pashuon kii kuch zyada hi puch ho jaati he
 His dog 'PD' has been overshadowed on social media due to Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's tweet before the Gujarat elections
 aisa hi kuch isi saal ke shuru main hue upi vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan bhi dekha gaya tha
 Then the then Chief Minister of UP Akhilesh Yadav, through his statement, had 'donkey' in the electoral battle
 himachal pradeshmen 9 november ko matdaan hona he
 There is an 'animal' issue in this mountain state too and that is 'monkey'
 sahi kaha jaae to ‘bandaron kaa aatank’ bhi himachal main bada chunavi mudda he
 No leader has made the monkey issue in Himachal
 balki yahaan ke log bandaron ke aantak se is kadar pareshaan he ki wo chunaav main khadey ummidavaaron se bandaron se nijaat dilaane kaa vaada sabase pehle le rahe hai
 That is, the issue of monkeys has become as important as inflation, corruption, unemployment in Himachal
 bagban-kisaan to isliye pareshaan hai ki bandar unki fasalon-baghichon ko nasht kar jate hai
 The story does not end there; monkeys are fiercely building up in Shimla and other tourist places of the state
 desh-videsh se aane vaale sailaani bhi in bandaron se bahut khauf khate hai
 In the blink of an eye, these monkeys take away the food items
 virodh kiye jane par ye bandar hamalaa karne se bhi nahin chookte
 Many people in the state have been injured in monkey attacks
 kuch log apni jaan bhi ganvaa chuke hai
 There is a Congress government in Himachal for five years
 isse pehle paanch saal bijepi kaa rajya main raaj tha
 But neither the BJP nor the Congress could overcome the problem of monkeys
 shashan-prashasan ke liye bandar lagaataar bada sirdard bane hue hai
 The Virbhadra Singh government in Himachal also tried modern technology with traditional tricks to keep the monkeys away from the people, but the monkeys did not stand up
 beete saal april main shimla main bandaron ke aatank se logon ko mukti dilaane ke liye himachal pradesh vanya praani vibhaag ne aadhunik jugad dhundha
 For this, Ultrasonic Monkey Repellent Sound Device was installed as a pilot project on BSNL Building in Shimla
 sochaa to yahi gaya tha ki is divaais se bandar vahaan se kai kilometre dur bhaag jaaenge
 But this device could not give any special result in front of monkeys
 udhar, himachal ke dehati ilaakon main rahane vaale logon kii maang thi ki agar ye divaais bandaron ko bhagane main kargar rahati he to kisaanon ko bhi ise muhaiyaa karaayaa jaae
 Chief Conservator of Forests (wildlife) PL Chauhan also considers the problem of monkeys as complex
 vahiin, bijepi netaa or hamirpur se saansad anuraag thakur bhi himachal chunaav ke teen mukhya muddon main ek mudda ‘bandaron ke aatank’ ko bhi maanate hai

 53 in 2003 is an example of how the people of Delhi got ready for politics
 42 fisadi matdaan hua tha, jo 2013 main badhkar 65
 63 percent and this time this number is going to increase, because this time election can decide the political future of many leaders, especially Arvind Kejriwal and if BJP loses, Kiran Bedi's political career will probably never go up

 Kiran Bedi's name was announced recently

 There was a competition between Aam Aadmi Party and BJP
 phir media kaa survey aana shuru ho gaya or aam aadmi party ko badhat dikhaai jane lagi
 i asked people in Chandni Chowk whether the survey of TV newspapers affected your thinking
 main chakit rah gaya ki log akhbaar or tivi ko kitne gambhirtha se lete hai
 People were still taking the name of BJP, but the voter of the Aam Aadmi Party who was silent was now speaking freely to the media
 lekin ek baat bataa duun media main bolne vaale voter se aap ye andaja nahin laga sakate hai ki sachai kya he
 
 yahi vajah he ki sabhi survey sach nahin hote or sabhi eczit pole bhi
 Also, there is no truth in the crowd gathering in the meetings, because there is no truth in how the crowd is brought
 ek aadmi ke raily main jane kaa rate 500 rupee or dopaher kaa khaanaa he
 Daily laborers are not available on the day in the area where there is a big rally, because the wage of a laborer is 300 rupees
 sach yah he ki jo vot dene voting ke din nikalegaa vahi tay karegaa ki kiski sarkaar banegi
 In such a situation, the contest is between the common man versus the special person

 ek intervyuu main gayak kailash kher ne kaha tha ki justin bibar jaise bade kalakaar ke saamne sonakshi kaa gaanaa thik nahin he, isse antarrashtriya str par galat sandesh jayega, kyonki vah koi prasiddh gayika nahin, balki abhinetri hai
 In his upcoming film Barfi, actor Ranbir Kapoor is playing the character of a lost girl, deaf and actress Priyanka Chopra, but he says that this film is not about disability
 anuraag basu dwaara nirdesht yah romantic kamedi murphi (ranbir kapur) naamak ek ladke par kendrit he jise sabhi log barfi kahkar bulaate hai
 This boy who always laughs and jokes with people, even though he cannot speak and hear anything, he still likes people
 jabaki jhilmil (priyanka) ek aatmalin (otistic) ladki he
 The film also stars Tamil actress Ilena Dikruz
 somvaar raat film ke pehle promo jari karne par ranbir kapur ne kaha ki is film ko viklaangata ke saath nahin joda janaa chaiye
 It is a coincidence that one character in this film is dumb deaf and the other self-righteous
 yah ek prem kahani he
 He said, 'if you look at the character of Elena you will feel a never ending romance, and if you look at the love story between me and Priyanka, you will feel a heart touching romance
 ’ranbir kii tarah hi priyanka ne bhi film ko gunge baharon kii film na bataakar ise unke jivan main hone vaale pyaar or khushi ko dikhaane vaali film qaraar diya
 It is not only the political parties but the public too who love to talk big about the principles before the election
 lekin jab vot lene or dene kii baari aati he, to nateeja vahi 'dhak ke teen paat'
 The matter comes again on 'jat' and 'pant'
 
 
 pesh he 'bihar diary bifor ellection' kii 17veen kist
 
 
 In the JDU and CPI deal, Begusarai and Banka seats have come to the cpi's account and 'good Governance Babu' has cut the ticket of Monajir Hasan, perhaps taking Kishanganj and slamming it
 idhar monajir ufan rahe hai, to duusari taraf commeredon main ghamaasan he
 While the District Committee put forward the name of former MP and teacher union leader Shatrughan Singh, the Central Committee imposed former MLA and Secretary of the State Committee on Rajendra Singh
 shatrughna babu sharif aadmi maane jate hai, lekh likhanewaale tip
 While an intellectual element, Rajendra Singh, on the other hand, also has a great reputation among the Bahubalis, and people say that he is also close to LJP leader Surajbhan
 rajendra singh ko sipiai mahasachiv abi bardhan kaa varadahast mila hua he, jabaki sthaneey ikai ne unke virodh main lambey-lambey khat likhe hai
 Some have resigned from the post
 cader aadhaarit anushaasan vaali party kaa ye haal dekhakar bade bujurg kehete hai ki sach main jamaana kharaab chal rahaa he
 Good governance Babu did just fine by giving both seats to the CPI
 pichley chunaav main lahar ke baavjood unka ummidavaar baankaa main digvijay singh kii patni or nirdaleey ummidavaar putul devi ke saamne khet rahaa tha
 Monajir became MP from Begusarai in Lehar, but this was the exception in Bhumihars stronghold
 aaazaad bharat ke itihaas main begusarai se shaayad pehali baar koi gaiyr-bhoomihaar saansad bana ho
 One can say that Begusarai was Moscow for comrades and Mecca for Bhumihars
 jharkhand alag hone ke baad bache hue bihar main ekmaatr audyogic ilaaka begusarai kaa barauni tha, jahaan rifinary, fertilizer or bijli banane ke kaarkaane batch gaye the
 Barauni is also a very important rail junction of Bihar, from where most of the trains from the north-east go
 uttar or dakshin bihar ko jodanevaala pehla pul patna ke aasapaas na banakar yaheen bana, jab shri babu (shrikrishna singh) mukhyamantri the
 Later, Begusarai became the cultural capital of Bihar
 isaki shaayad vajah ye thi ki yahaan hone vaale vibhinn saanskrithik kaarykram ke liye sarkari audyogic ikaayiyon ne sponcership dena shuru kar diya, jo bihar ke anya kshetron ko naseeb nahin hua
 But the manner in which the decline of communist parties in Bihar since the Lalu era is worth seeing
 ratorat bahut saare commered brahman or yadav main tabdeel ho gaye or communist partiyaan dher hoti gayi
 There was a time when the Communist group from all over Bihar won six Lok Sabha seats
 madhubani main commered bhogendra jha the, jinhone jagannatha mishra kaa chunavi kariyar khatm kar diya tha, to bhagalpur main sipiem ke subodh raay the
 In such a situation, it is not very difficult to understand where the fight between the comrades in Begusarai will take him
 dinakarji kii jameen haal main jis tarah 'laal' se 'bhagava' hui he, uskaa ek namoona yah bhi he ki ab yahaan simriya main 'kumbh' lagane laga he or dharamshastron se uske liye tark khojkar jutaaye jane lage hai

 ) saaf-suthra chunaav vahi he jo na sirf swatantra, nishpaksh shantipurna dhang se sampann ho balki logon ko lage bhi ki haa, yah swatantra or nishpaksh dhang se hua he
 This perception really matters because if the participants feel that the election process is biased, non-accountable or corrupt, then they can take any other route than the fixed pattern to achieve their objective and Can get down to electoral violence
 kai baar chunavi hinsa virdohi paksh ke yaa ant tak uhapoh main rahane vaale votaron ko matdaan centre par na aane dene kii tarkeeb ke taur par bhi istemaal hoti he
 Therefore, it is necessary for the people engaged in election arrangements to provide strict security and law and order to protect the election process from confrontation and violence
 chunaav ke prabandhakon ko chupchaap booth capcharing jaise sambhavit gaiyr-hinsak tareekon ko lekar bhi satark rahanaa chahie
 These tips are also used at some polling stations
 bharat main chunaav ke dauraan hinsa mukhya rup se bhartiya samaaj main pasri anek tarah kii saamaajik or chunavi visangatiyon ke kaaran hoti he
 The diversity of our society presents many challenges
 isamen anek tarah kii antardharaayein hai jaise ki jatigat golbandi, sampradayik vibhaajan, aarthik asamanta, vibhinn kshetreey tathaa bhashaai aakankshaayen
 They all play their role
 chunaav ke dauraan ye sabhi tatv or bhi samvedansheel or ahm ho jate hai
 In the current situation, the major cause of violence and insecurity in elections is the increasing criminalization in politics, increase in muscle power and role of money power
 chunaav prakriya ko khatra sirf bahari tatwon se nahin, balki chunaav adhikariyon kaa aacharan bhi khatra paidaa kar saktaa he
 Officers sympathetic to corrupt or political parties can also create disturbances in the electoral process
 chunaav ayog jaraa-sa bhi sandigdh dikhne par varisht police adhikariyon yaa ucch padon par baithe afasarshahon ko bhi nahin bakhshata
 a few weeks before the start of the election process, his entire record is called and kept
 afasaron ke khilaaf rajnatik dalon kii shikayaton par gambhirtha se vichaar kiya jaataa he or jaise hi chunaav ayog ko lagata he ki falaan afasar ke kaaran chunaav kii nishpakshta prabhavit ho sakati he to fouran us afasar kaa tabadalaa kar diya jaataa he
 Usually, intelligence officers or security related police officers who are directly involved in the management of elections are not teased, but there are occasions that it became very important to act on them
 iskaa sabase bada udhaaharan tamilnadu kii 2011 kii ghatana he
 Our officials who have visited the state said that a senior police officer sitting on the post of ADGP (intelligence Department) is calling on various political superintendents and digs of the state by giving political directions and giving some instructions
 apane siyaasi rasookh kii vajah se police adhikariyon par unka kaaphi dabadabaa tha
 Such complaints were being received and it was feared that they would use their position to benefit the ruling party
 halaat kaa jayja lene ke baad chunaav ayog is nattejey par pahunchaa ki nishpaksh prakriya ke liye is afasar ko chunaav ke dauraan maukey se dur rakhana hi behatar hoga
 All of us in the commission were hesitant to move away from our policy of not covering security or intelligence officers
 us afasar ko baatcheet ke liye ayog ke mukhyalay main bulaayaa gaya or kaha gaya ki unhen pashchim bengal main paryvekshak banaakar bheja ja rahaa he
 He was stunned to hear this and he coined a story to impress us
 unhone kaha ki altitii ke chunaav main khalal daalane or teen rashtriya netaaon ko nishaanaa banane (teen netaaon ke naam bhi liye) kii khufia jaankaree unke paas he
 Our suspicion was that they were making this excuse to continue in their position
 hamane sochaa ki apni baat ko 'sahi’ sabit karne ke liye ve yahaan-vahaan kuch gadabadi karvaa sakate hai
 Then, we made up our mind to express our doubts directly to them and said that if anything went wrong, our first doubt would go to them
 isse baat ban gai
 He agreed to go on leave and stay out of Tamil Nadu during this period

 He had gone to Malaysia on leave
 is tarah kaa anoothaa kadam uthaanaa mahatvapurn tha kyonki logon kii raay main chunaav kii saakh bani rahe, yah sabase jaruri he
 Though the matter was resolved, i spoke to Chief Secretary Gopal Pillai as a precaution
 unhone bataaya ki altitii kii dhamkee kii baat bakawaas he
 He enumerated two reasons for this: One, the LTTE threat was outdated and second, the officer giving notice of it had moved to another post several months before getting promoted

 These days a video is going viral on social media, in which the body of a 25-year-old man has come out from the stomach of a dragon
 yah dekhakar har koi hairaan he
 The incident is from a village on West Sulawesi Island in Indonesia
 is ajgar kii lambaai lagbhag 20 feet kii thi
 25-year-old Akbar Salebiro was going to see the crop in his farm as usual, but could not return home
 jab gharavaalon ne uski talash shuru kii to unhen jangal main ek mrit ajgar mila
 Whose stomach was bloated, when people saw the dragon ripping, Akbar's body was found in it
 gaanv ke ek vyakti ne kaha ki hamen jaise hi yah abhas hua ki ajgar akbar ko nigal gaya he to hamane ajgar ko chirane ke aujaar ikkatha shuru kar diya
 Such species are found in Indonesia and the Philippines, with an average length of up to 20 feet
 isse pehle bhi 2013 main bali main ek ajgar ne guard ko nigal liya tha
 According to research, it is a dragon of reticulated caste
 is prakaar ke ajgar adhiktar rup se bade shikaron ko khate hai
 Their main food is considered wild boar and dogs
 kaha jaataa he ki is prakaar ke ajgar insaani bastiyon main jane se ghabaraate hai
 With this size, the python targets large prey
 ye junglee boar or kutton ko shikaar banaate hai
 Although they avoid going to human settlements
 ye palm oil ke bagaanon ko shikaar ke lihaaj se acha samajhate hai
 Wild boar and dogs are found here

 Former India coach Greg Chappell has given rise to fresh controversy over Rahul Dravid in his new book, saying that if Dravid could have got as much support as he had given to the rest of the captains, he would have been the most successful captain in the country
 chapel ne likhaa he ki dravid ne bharat ko kai maichon main jeet dilaai lekin team ke kuch sadsy uski kamyaabi par khush nahin hote the
 He wrote in his book 'rahul Dravid: Timeless Steel', not everyone celebrated the team's success
 kuch khilaadiyon ko isse dar lagata tha or ve rahul ke khilaaf rahete the
 He said, if he had wholeheartedly supported Rahul in the same way as Rahul has given to others, then the latest history of Indian cricket would have been different
 vah bharat kaa sabase safal captain ban saktaa tha
 The former Australia captain told how India had won nine consecutive odis under Dravid
 toss jitkar usne virdohi team ko ballebaaji kaa nyotaa diya or baad main ballebaaji karte hue lagaataar record 17 jeet darj kii
 Chappell said, for better performance chasing the target, Rahul used to invite the opposing team to bat first
 halaat chaahe jo ho
 Under his captaincy, India won nine consecutive odis against Pakistan and England
 iske alaava lakshya kaa peechha karte hue record lagaataar 17 jeet darj kii
 Chappell said that due to this attitude of Dravid, India also won Tests abroad
 chapel ne likhaa, test cricket main bhi uske isi ravaiye se bharat ne westeindies main 35 saal main pehla test jeeta
 Won first test in South Africa
 capatoun main aakhri test kii duusari pari main bharat ne acchhee ballebaaji kii hoti to shrinkhalaa bhi jeet jate
 Chappell was referring to India's victory in the Test series in the West Indies in 2006
 iske baad 2006-07 main johanisburg main bharat ne pehla test jeeta lekin agle do test haar gaya
 During his tenure as the coach of the Indian team, while Chappell's relations with Dravid were sweet, he did not get along with captain Sourav Ganguly
 tippaniyan In the book Walt Disney Company India Private Limited, Chappell said, "men don't usually say such things but i like Rahul Dravid very much
" chapel ne kaha ki dravid ne hameshaa maidan par apana shat-pratishat yogadan diya or vah kaaphi behatar captain tha
 He said, he always contributed wholeheartedly
 bataur captain uskaa jo record he, usase vah kahi behatar captain tha
 Chappell said that Dravid never took wrong decisions as a player or said profanity about anyone

 Some players were afraid of this and were against Rahul
 unhone kaha, yadi unhone puure dil se rahul kaa usee tarah saath diya hota jitna rahul ne dusron kaa diya he to bhartiya cricket kaa taaja itihaas alag hota
 He could become the most successful captain of India
 australia ke purv captain ne bataaya ki kaise dravid kii aguwai main bharat ne lagaataar nau vanade jite the
 After winning the toss, he invited the opposing team to bat and later batting, recorded a record 17 consecutive wins
 chapel ne kaha, lakshya kaa peechha karte hue behatar pradarshan ke liye rahul virdohi team ko pehle ballebaaji kaa nyotaa detaa tha
 Whatever be the situation
 uski captaini main bharat ne pakistan or england ke khilaaf lagaataar nau vanade jite
 In addition, chasing the target recorded a record 17 consecutive wins
 chapel ne kaha ki dravid ke isi ravaiye ke kaaran bharat ne videsh main bhi test jite
 Chappell wrote, India also won the first Test in 35 years in the West Indies with the same attitude in Test cricket
 dakshin africa main pehla test jeeta
 Had India batted well in the second innings of the last Test in Cape Town, they would have won the series
 chapel ne 2006 main westeindies main test shrinkhalaa main bharat kii jeet kaa zikr kar rahe the
 After this, India won the first Test in Johannesburg in 2006–07 but lost the next two Tests

 The comments walt dijani company india privet limited kii kitaab main chapel ne kaha, purush aamtaur par aisi baaten nahin kehete hai lekin mujhe rahul dravid bahut pasand he
 Chappell said that Dravid always contributed 100 percent on the field and he was a much better captain
 unhone kaha, usne hameshaa puure dil se apana yogadan diya
 He was a better captain than his record as a captain
 chapel ne kaha ki dravid ne kabhi bataur khilaadi galat faisle nahin liye yaa kisi ke bare main apshabd nahin kahe

 pakistan cricket board ne somvaar ko captain younis khan kaa istipha khaarij karte hue unhen 2011 vishwa cap tak team kii kaman saunpi di lekin yah unke feet hone par nirbhar karegaa
 After the board's governing council meeting, PCB chairman Ejaz Butt said, "if he stays fit, he will remain captain until the 2011 World Cup
 ’’ tii-20 vishwa cap main pakistan kii jeet, champions trophy main bharat par jeet or dakshin africa main isisi toornament ke semifinal main team ke pahunchane kii ore ishaara karte hue bat ne poocha, ‘‘is saal itane achche pradarshan ke baad kya aapako lagata he ki use badla janaa chahie
 Younis resigned after being angered by the inquiry of the National Assembly's standing committee on sports and its head Jamshed Dasti

 Now, in director Ahishore Solomon's first directorial film 'john Day', he has gone a step ahead by doing a new feat
 is baar apni shaitani andaaj ko parade par utaarne ke liye randeep ne apane costar sikandar ko na sirf lip lock kis kiya he balki apane tej daanton se unki jeebh hi kaat lee he
 This is the first such scene in the history of Indian films
 randeep kaa yah seen charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 Even film experts are not denying that this picture is proof that Bollywood is really maturing now
 vishesh rup se randeep hooda un kalakaaron ke liye prerana ban chuke hai jo sachmuch kuch nayaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Although the kissing scene is not a big deal to play his character with all sincerity, yet few dare like Randeep are in the cast
 sikandar ke saath filmaae gaye is seen ko perfect seen banane ke liye randeep ko kai ritex dene padey lekin randeep ne haar nahin maanin
 It is indeed a praise of Gaur and Kaibile
 good going randeep

 The ministers who met the organization general secretary Ramlal on Monday and expressed their displeasure against Gajendra Singh Shekhawat include Rajya Sabha MP Ramnarayan Dudhi, Younus Khan, Rajendra Singh Rathore, Ram Pratap, Prabhulal Saini, Ajay Kilak, Surendra Pal Singh
 iske alaava bhi kai anya vidhayak dilli pahunch chuke hai
 Party General Secretary Ramlal gave confidence to all the ministers and mlas from Rajasthan and said that the state president's decision would be with the consent of all
 sabhi jaanate hai ki antim faisla piem narendra modi or party adhyaksh amit shah ko hi lenaa he
 If the president will soon decide on the decision, then the name of the new state president of Rajasthan BJP can be announced in the next one or two days
 rajasthan bijepi se sambandh rakhane vaale bijepi ke netaa kaa maananaa he ki jis tarah se loksabhaa kii 2 or vidhansabha kii ek seat par upachunaav ke nattejey aae the usase to lagata he ki janata sanghathan or sarkaar se naaraaz he
 In such a situation, there should be a change in the organization and the state government
 vidhansabha chunaav se thik 6 maheene pehle pradesh adhyaksh ko lekar jis tarah se amit shah or vasundhara raaje ke bich siyaasi jang shuru hui hai wo 2009 kii yaad dilaati hai
 Then BJP President Rajnath Singh asked Raje to resign from the post of Leader of the Opposition
 lekin teen maheene tak vasundhararaaje ne istifa nahin diyaor tab rajnath singh samet puri party ko naakon chane chaabne pade the
 CM Raje is also aware of the nose question for Raje, now that his fight is not with Rajnath Singh but with PM Modi's commander and BJP President Amit Shah
 pichhali baar unhen peeche se samarthan dene waalon kii lambi fehrist thi jisamen laalkrishna adwani, sushamaa swaraj, arun jetali, venkaiya naidu jaise netaa the
 But this time they have to fight the battle on their own
 vasundhara agar is baar shekhavat ko pradesh adhyaksh banane se rokane main kaamyaab rahati hai to phir aglaa pradesh adhyaksh naa rajput hoga or naa hi jat hoga
 If sources are to be believed, Raje is placing her bets on former state president Arun Chaturvedi, Laxminarayan Dave, Srichand Kripalani
 duusari tarah amit shah gajendra singh shekhavat ke alaava arjunaram meghavaal, madanlaal saini or satish puniya ko rajasthan ke adhyaksh pad dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Amit Shah had no problem in announcing the name of MP Rakesh Singh from Jabalpur for the new state president in Madhya Pradesh last week
 lekin rajasthan main jis tarah pradesh adhyaksh ko lekar virdohi sur sunai de rahe hai isse vidhansabha chunaav ke saath-saath 2019 main bhi party ko nuksaan ho saktaa hai
 Amit Shah knows that while strengthening the organization, the election should not go out of hand
 yahi vajah ki wo rajasthan ke maamle main har kadam phoonk-phoonk kar rakh rahe hai

 Amit Shah, who ensured the bjp's miraculous performance in UP during the Lok Sabha elections, now has a big responsibility
 ve ab party ke adhyaksh he or use chalaane kii jimmedaari unke kandhon par he
 But the challenges before Shah are also not less
 inhen chunautiyon par ek najar1
 It is a big challenge for them to bring forward the youth while ensuring respect for the old warriors of the party
 un yuva netaaon kii pahchaan karnaa, jo rashtriya str par party ko chalaane main sakasham he
 So that the place of those leaders can be filled, who joined the Modi government
 2
 Amit Shah is not like the traditional leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 jaise rajnath singh
 Shah's style of working is professional and has many layers
 jahaan paardarshita kaa abhaav he
 Also his association with the cadre is mild
 ranneeti or survey ke dam par chunaav to jite ja sakate hai lekin party chalaanaa alag baat he
 3
 maharashtra, bihar, haryana, jharkhand, pashchim bengal or uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi kii jeet sunishchit karnaa
 Also tell the minorities that BJP thinks their interest
 bihar jaise rajyon main shah ke liye yah badi chunauti he
 Muslim population is not less in Bengal and UP too
 4
 Managing the emergence of regional leaders within the BJP and handling allies like Shiv Sena will be a big challenge for Shah
 iske alaava sapa or tiemasi jaise partiyon ke saamaajik or aarthik chunautiyon kii kaat bhi dhundhana hoga
 5
 hamen puri ummid he ki dakshin bharat main party ko sthapit karnaa unki praathamikta main sabase upar hoga
 With Karnataka falling out of the grip of the BJP, the BJP has no strong base in Telangana
 vahiin tamilnadu or kerala jaise rajyon main bijepi ko apni jagah banani he
 At the same time, the dominance of the Congress in the North East states will have to be broken
 6
 They will also have to ensure that the development and needs of the party do not fall in love with the government
 shah ko aresas kii sansthaaon se bhi apane rishte ko sudhaarna hoga, jinhone loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ko madad kii thi
 7
 shah ko yuva peedi or madhya varg kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga, jinhone chunaavon main bijepi ko vot kiya tha
 To ensure that the government fulfills the expectations of the public while tolerating criticism of the Modi government
 jisase ki rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main party kaa pradarshan prabhavit naa ho

 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne bhale hi bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke purv sanghathan mahaamantri sanjay joshi ko party se baahar karne ke liye koi kor kasar na chodi ho, lekin khud joshi kaa kahana he ki unka kisi se koi bair nahin he
 He has also clarified his position on the poster war from Delhi to Gujarat, saying that those who do so cannot be bjp's well wishers
 darasal, sanjay joshi ne bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ke naam ek apil jari kii he, jisamen yah baaten kahi gai hai
 He appealed to the activists not to issue any posters, leaflets nor carry out any campaign against any leader or leaders, saying that party and ideology is paramount for them
 yah dhyey ke viruddh hoga
 Earlier, under the pressure of Modi, for the first time after the BJP removed Sanjay Joshi from the executive and then accepted his resignation, for many days, posters with his name and picture from Delhi to Gujarat and many parts of the country There were incidents of aisi ghatnaon ko anjaam dene waalon ko modi virdohi or joshi samarthak bataaya ja rahaa tha
 The BJP itself called it the hand of anti-social elements
 joshi ne apni apil main kaha he, 'in ghatnaon par main pehle bhi spasht kar chukaa hum ki aisa karne vaale bhaajapa ke shubhachintak nahin ho sakate
 This is the work of conspirators
 main party kaaryaktaaon evam shubhachintakon se apil karata hum ki na ve kisi prakaar kaa poster, pamplett jari karen or na hi mere paksh main koi abhiyaan chalaaen
 He said, 'I have always considered the duty of the party to be greater than myself
 vyakti kaa mahatv dal ke kaaran he
 For me party and ideology are paramount
 bijepi he tabhi ham he isliye hamen aisa koi kadam nahin uthaanaa chahie, jisase bijepi ko nuksaan ho
 At this time, as the condition of the country is there, posters or other such campaigns can try to take advantage of it
 ve party or netaaon ko bhi badnaam karne kaa shadyantr rach sakate hai
 There is a need to avoid them
 'joshi kii party se vidaai main bhale hi modi kaa haath ho lekin khud joshi kehete hai, 'main spasht karnaa chaahunga ki meraa kisi se bair nahin he
 Therefore, any such poster, pamphlet or campaign is against any one leader or leaders, it will be against the cause
 yah samay vivek or dhairya se party hit main kaam karne kaa he
 'he said that today the country is grappling with formidable problems like inflation and corruption, which need to be fought firmly
 aise samay main vyaktigat ragadwesh se upar uthakar hamen kendra kii us goongi-baheri sarkaar ke khilaaf abhiyaan ko majbootee dene kii jarurat he jo aam aadmi ke hiton se beparwaah he
 It is worth mentioning that under pressure from Modi, Joshi was first shown the way out of the executive and later on the party said that he had requested to leave the party, which was accepted by the president Nitin Gadkari
 iske baad joshi ne haalanki kaha tha ki unhone party nahin balki uttar pradesh kii jimmedaari se mukt kiye gaye jane kaa aagrah kiya tha na ki party se
 However, Joshi has issued this appeal on the letterhead of the BJP
 maharashtra main teesri baar laga raashtrapati shashansbase pehle saal 1980 main laga tha raashtrapati shashanmaharashtra main sarkaar banane kii koshishon par philhal viraam lag gaya he
 Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari had recommended imposition of President's rule in the state, which has been approved by President Ram Nath Kovind
 maharashtra ke itihaas main ye teesraa mauka he jab rajya main raashtrapati shashan laga he
 The state was first under President's rule in the year 1980
 vahiin iske 34 saal baad yani 2014 main duusari baar maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan lagu kiya gaya
 The House was dissolved on 17 February 1980 after the then Chief Minister Sharad Pawarco did not have a majority in the Assembly
 rajya main 17 farvari se 8 june 1980 tak raashtrapati shashan laga tha
 At the same time, President's rule was imposed in the state on 28 September 2014
 tab congress sarkaar main shaamil NCP sahit anya dalon se alag ho gai thi or vidhansabha ko bhang kiya gaya tha
 President's rule on 28 September was in force for 30 days i
e
 30 days
 kya he sanvaidhanik vyavastharashtrapati shashanse jude praavdhaan samvidhan ke anuchhed 356 main die gaye hai
 According to Article 356, the President can impose President's rule in any state if he is satisfied that the State Government is not acting as per various provisions of the Constitution
 aisa jaruri nahin he ki raashtrapati us rajya ke rajyapal kii report ke aadhaar par hi yah faisla len
 This article is a tool that enables the central government to assert its authority over a state government in the event of a civil unrest such as a state government failing to deal with a riot
 samvidhan main is baat kaa bhi ullekh he ki raashtrapati shashan lagaae jane ke do maheenon ke andar sansad ke donon sadanon dwaara iskaa anumodan kiya janaa jaruri he
 Presidential rule is imposed when a party or coalition does not have a clear majority in a House
 rajyapal sadan ko 6 maheene kii avadhi ke liye 'nilambit avasthaa' main rakh sakate hai
 After 6 months, re-election is held if no clear majority is obtained
 yadi sansad ke donon sadanon dwaara raashtrapati shashan kaa anumodan kar diya jaataa he to raashtrapati shashan 6 maah tak chalata rahegaa
 In this way it can be carried forward for 3 years by doing 6-6 months
