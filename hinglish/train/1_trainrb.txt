 - Raj Babbar (@rajbabbarmp) December 8, 2019 Music composer Manoj Muntasir wrote, 'there was no emergency exit in the building
 koi bhi jimmedaari nahin lenaa chahta or ek baar phir koi bhi isse sikh nahin legaa
 Many people have lost their lives in this accident
 lekin logon kii jindagi ke liye hamaare man main koi izzat nahin he'
 NO emergency exits in the building, NO one ready to take the responsibility and once again NO lessons will be learned
 32 people loosing their lives is tragic, but our zero respect for human life is devastating

 The declaration of support of various Muslim organizations and religious leaders to the BSP in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections proved to be harmful rather than fruitful for this party
 dilli kii jama masjid ke shahi imam moulana ahamed bukhari, pramukh shiya dharmagur or ol india muslim personal lau board ke varisht sadsy moulana kalbe javwaad or purvanchal ke kuch ilaakon main prabhaavshaalee maani jane vaali rashtriya ulema council samet kai muslim sanghathanon tathaa dharmaguruon ne chunaav main basapa ko samarthan kaa elaan karte hue musalamaanon se is party ko vot dene kii apil kii thi
 But all bets failed
 tippaniyan The predominantly Muslim districts of the state include Rampur, Saharanpur, Moradabad, Amroha, Bareilly, Azamgarh, Mau, Shahjahanpur, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut and Aligarh
 in jilon kii kul 77 siton main se basapa ko kul jamaa chaar siton par hi jeet hasil hui
 Rampur has about 52 percent Muslim population, but the BSP could not win any of its five seats
 party kaa yahi haal saharanpur or muradabad main bhi rahaa
 The BSP sweep in all seven seats in Saharanpur and in Moradabad
 yahaan tak kii devband jaisi khantee muslim bahul seat par bhi moulanaon kii apil kaa koi asar nahin hua or vahaan bhi basapa haar gai
 In Moradabad, it stood at number three on most seats
 amroha main bhi basapa chaar main se ek bhi seat nahin jeet saki or yahaan bhi vah zyaadaatar tisare sthaan par rahi
 In all of Bareilly's nine seats, the BSP suffered a crushing defeat
 shahjahanpur kii sabhi chah siton par basapa tisare sthaan par rahi
 Out of the 10 seats in Azamgarh, only the BSP could win on Sagadi, Lalganj and Didarganj seats
 mau kii sadar seat ko chhodkar baaki sabhi teen siton par basapa ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The BSP lost badly in all the seven seats in Meerut and Aligarh
 kul milakar, jo tasviir saamne aayi he usamen muslim dharmaguron kii basapa ke paksh main samarthan kii apil phaayde ke bajaay uske liye nuksaandeh hi sabit hui he
 In 2007, the BSP, which reached its height by forming an absolute majority government in the state, reached the abyss with just 19 seats in this year's assembly elections
 pradesh ke muslim bahul jilon main rampur, saharanpur, muradabad, amroha, bareli, azamgarh, mau, shahjahanpur, shamali, mujffarnagar, meerut tathaa aligarh pramukh rup se shaamil hai
 Out of the total 77 seats in these districts, the BSP won only four seats
 rampur main kareeb 52 pratishat muslim aabaadi he magar yahaan kii paanch main se ek bhi seat par basapa nahin jeet saki
 The same situation of the party was also held in Saharanpur and Moradabad
 saharanpur kii saaton or muradabad kii sabhi nau siton par basapa kaa supada saaf ho gaya
 Even in the Khanty Muslim-majority seat like Deoband, the appeal of the Maulanas had no effect and the BSP was defeated there too
 muradabad main zyaadaatar siton par vah tisare nambar par rahi
 In Amroha too, the BSP could not win a single seat out of four and here too it was mostly third
 bareli kii nau siton main se sabhi main basapa ko karaari paraajay kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 BSP came third on all six seats in Shahjahanpur
 azamgarh kii 10 siton main se sirf sagadi, lalganj tathaa didarganj siton par hi basapa jeet saki
 Except the Sadar seat of Mau, the BSP lost all three seats
 meerut or aligarh kii bhi sabhi saat-saat siton par basapa kii buree haar hui
 Overall, in the picture which has come out, the appeal of Muslim religious leaders in favor of BSP has proved to be harmful rather than beneficial

 So, you say, forget the marriage, you have told everyone that something is going on between you and me? Sara Khan came down to the pool wearing a bikini, see PHOTOS Kangana's five statements: From Karan Johar to Hrithik, someone Kangna had said during an interview that she is single
 shaadi karnaa chaahati hai, lekin abhi vyast hai
 She has asked her sister to find the boy
 lekin unki bahan ne ye kehete hue haath khadey kar die hai, ki ve unke liye ladkaa nahin dhund saktin
 However, Kangana has said all this lightly
 magar ek baat he, jo wo gambhirtha se kahati najar ain
 He said that i have not seen a single married man happy in my life
 agar kisi shaadishuda mard ko mere saath ek minute kaa samay bhi miltaa he, to vah apni patni kii buraai karne lagata he
 The conflict between Kangana and Karan Johar over nepotism will probably never end
 haal hi main ek tivi intervyuu main phir kangana ne karan par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki vah movie mafia hai
 On the relationship with Aditya Pancholi, Kangana also says that Aditya and he had been in a relationship for three years
 magar aditya ne unhen shaareerik rup se chot pahunchaain
 He used to beat them
 unase bachane ke liye unhen hotel main jaakar ruknaa padaa
 But Aditya also reached the hotel behind him
 aise main vah anuraag kashyap ke offis main rahi thim
 He also filed an FIR against Aditya after being upset with him
 box offis par ajay kii damdaar vaapasi, kaajol nahin ye thim 'singhm' kaa pehla pyarbox offis padhjay devgan kii film baadshaaho ko jabardast risponsmil rahaa he
 The film has given a befitting reply to critics by grossing over 27 crores so far
 baadshaaho desh main 2800 screens par or videsh main 442 screens par relies hui he
 Critics may not have liked the film much, but the box office results say something else
 film ke ek hafte ke collection se saaf ho jayega ki ajay devgan box offis ke baadshaaho ban paaenge yaa nahin
 Ajay Devgan's film graph has been very volatile
 baadshaaho se pehle ajay kii film shivaay, drishyam or ection jaction kuch khaas collection nahin kar pai thi
 Therefore, all their hopes rest on the king
 yah to rahi filmon kii baat, agar personal front kii baat karen to ajay kii nijee jindagi kaa haal bhi kuch aisa hi rahaa he
 Today, Ajay Devgan's life may be stable, but before his marriage to Kajol, there was a lot of turmoil in his life
 ab aap kahenge ki ajay to kaajol se pyaar karte the or unheen se shaadi bhi kii to utaar-chadhaav kaisaa? dilachasp baat yah he ki bahut kam log jaanate hai ki kaajol unka pehla pyaar nahin thim

 chandrayan-2 kii safal lonching par NASA ne di ISRO ko badhai Due to Arun Jaitley being in Japan, Nirmala Sitharaman could not even take charge as the defense minister yet

 congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi or congress ke mantriyon dwaara centre se milane vaali raashi kaa rajya dwaara samuchit upyog nahin kiye jane ke bayaan par buudhvaar ko palatwaar karte hue pradesh ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki congress adhyaksh sonia or rahul ‘jhuthe dhol peet rahe hai
 "not only Sonia and Yuvraj (rahul Gandhi) but also the central ministers of his party are beating the false drum of the Center giving more money to Bihar," Nitish told reporters at Patna's JDU state office
 ’ unhone kaha ki is tarah ke daavon ko lekar ve purv bhi apni pratikriya vyakt kar chuke hai, lekin ek baar phir unase yah jaananaa chaahate hai ki bihar ko anya rajyon kii tulana main centre dwaara kitni atirikt raashi di gayi
 Claiming that the Center did not provide any additional financial assistance to Bihar, Nitish said that Bihar was given share of central taxes and other fixed amounts as other states, as recommended by the Planning Commission
 varsh 2008 ke dauraan kosi kshetra main aayi pralayankari baadh kaa zikr karte hue kaha, ‘us samay centre dwaara di gayi ek hajaar karod rupee kii sahaayta raashi di gayi

 On the claim of giving more amount to Bihar by the UPA government at the center than during the Vajpayee regime, the Chief Minister of the state, Nitish Kumar, termed it as justification, saying that the increase in gross domestic product due to collection of taxes also increased the amount of budgetary support
 is
 nitish ne centre par bihar ko uskaa vaazib haq nahin die jane kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki kendriya bajet kaa ek bada hissaa centre apni yojanaon ke liye le letaa he, varanaa kendriya raashi main rajyon ko or adhik hissaa miltaa
 The Chief Minister alleged that despite the recommendation of the National Development Council to reduce the Central schemes, the UPA Government is increasing it year after year instead of reducing it
 bihar main ab tak jo bhi vikaas kaary hue hai ve centre kii raashi se hue hai congress ke daawey ke bare main nitish ne kaha ki congress netaaon ne itani udaartaa to dikhaayi ki unhone yah sweekaar kiya ki bihar main vikaas hua he
 Nitish claimed that not only was the Congress compelled to accept the development mantra given by the NDA government of the state but Mr
 Turnaround (lalu Prasad) has also started assuring people that if he is in power When we return, we will focus on the development of the state

 (input: IANS) kitaab:mekking india osm (new asej and colums)lekhak:chetan bhagatapablisher:roopapej:177keemat:176akhabaaron main kollam likhte hue chetan bhagat ko ek arsa ho gaya he
 Moving beyond the identity of the novelist, he has now also been called 'expert'
 unki duusari non-fiction kitaab agast 2015 main relies hui
 The name is 'making India Awesome'
 mulk kii samasyaon par unke lekhon or nibandhon kaa sangrah he yah kitaab
 In Chetan's own words, if the leader is the engine driver, he is the announcer
 is kitaab menunhone un samasyaon par baat kii he, jo unke mutabik desh ko 'osm' banane se roak rahe hai
 His 'obsession' is evidently about the word 'ausam'
 tital ke bare menchetan ne yah kitaab bhartiya yuvaaon ke naam kii he jo unki najar main 'osm' hai
 Before starting the talk, he has explained the meaning of all the three words of the title, 'making, India and Ausam' through the dictionary
 kitaab us yuva varg ko dhyaan main rakhkar likhi gai he jo raajnneetik vivaadon or bayaanbaji se ghira khud ko khoyaa hua paata he
 This is the same young man who is confused about his own politics due to the influence of big leaders, supporters, media and social media
 kiske liye he ye kitabachetan ke mutabik, agar aap yah kitaab padhate hai to desh ke un 4 fisadi logon main hai jo asal main desh kii fikr karte hai
 But the voices of these concerned people also suppress the bigoted fanatics of social media
 chetan likhte hai ki apni chuni hui party kii aalochana karne waalon ko log thali kaa bangan bataakar khaarij kar dete hai
 Then 4 percent of the people stop losing their voice and become part of the same silent public that has no meaning with the country
 haalanki 4 fisadi ke aankade kaa nirdhaaran chetan bhagat ne kisi survey kii buniyaad par nahin, nijee anubhavon ke aadhaar par kiya he jo unhen soshal media par mili
 How to make India 'ausam' conscious believes that to become an Ausam country, hard work is needed in four directions: governance, society, equality and resources
 shuruaati cholemon main vah pradhanmantri modi ke liye 17 nirdesh jari karke unase loktantric banane kii apil karte hai
 He talks like an undeclared mediator between the public and the Prime Minister
 yah baat dhyaan main rakhi jaae ki unhone puri baat virodh nahin shikaayat kii bhashaa main kahi he
 He does not appear to stand on the anti-government side
 bhrashtachar ke liye vah netaaon ke saath janata ko bhi doshi tehraate hai
 According to him, it is our moral responsibility to fight corruption
 aarthik vikaas kaa unka najariya yah he ki bijness-minded ravaiya apanaakar zyada se zyada nijeekaran karne se hi desh kaa bhala hoga
 On subjects like sex, he questions the double-mindedness of society
 vah samanta kii baat karte hai
 Appeal to men to see women as human beings, not as objects
 auraton se kehete hai ki khud ke bune hue pinjre se baahar nikalen
 But their understanding of gender issues comes to light when they argue in favor of working women that they contribute to the overall household income
 mahilaayein parivaar yaa arthvyavastha ke liye nahin, sirf khud ke liye bhi naukari kar sakati hai
 It is a matter of independence and perhaps Chetan has skipped it
 apni daleelon main vah 'rhite tu work' kaa mul bhul gaye hai or ek aisi tasviir bunate hai jaise har aurat kaa naukari karnaa ek purush se tyaag maangata ho
 Read or not
 The technique of writing books is such that you will feel that Chetan Bhagat is sitting in front of you and talking
 kitaab pard sakate hai agar aap chetan bhagat ke fain hai or unke colums follow karte hai
 Chetan has once again done what he is known for in this book - easy language, common sense arguments that he uses to illustrate everyday life, and his theories that he presents through flowcharts
 agar aap us yuva varg kaa hissaa hai jisane 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav follow kiye the, tab bhi yah kitaab pard sakate hai
 But its biggest drawback is that Chetan's arguments are based on personal experiences rather than facts
 desh ke aarthik vikaas ke unke model main na kuch nayaa he, na hi kuch alag
 At some places, they have simplified the issues so much that seriousness has been hampered
 is kitaab main us bade voter tabake ke liye kuch nahin he jo na desh ke raajnneetik vaad-vivaad kaa hissaa he, na soshal media par dikhataa he or phir bhi chunaavon ke nattejey tay karata he

 bhopal central jail se simi ke 8 aatankiyon ke bhaagane or phir encounter main unke maare jane ke maamle main madhya pradesh kii shivaraj singh chouhan sarkaar ghirti ja rahi he
 If the opposition parties are questioning the action of the police, then the Human Rights Commission has issued a notice in this matter
 rajya sarkaar maamle kii lipapoti karne main juty he
 CM Chauhan has of course refused to conduct any kind of investigation regarding this encounter
 magar aise tamaam sawaal ab bhi jinda hai jinke jawaab nahin mili to is ghatana ko lekar tamaam shaq bane rahenge
 1
 bhopal jail kii kshamta 1500 kaidiyon kii he lekin is samaygel main kareeb 3500 kaideeband hai
 The former DG of the state had described the security of Bhopal jail as God trust
 baavjood iske rajya sarkaar ne jail kii suraksha ko lekar jaruri kadam kyon nahin uthaae? jail prashasan ne simi aatankiyon kii suraksha badhaane kii maang kii thi
 But why did the state government ignore the letter of the officers? 2
 bhopal jail main band simi ke aatankiyon kii nigaraanee ke liye lage charonsisitivi camere kharabnikle hai
 While 42 CCTV cameras are installed in the entire jail premises
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ye chaar camere kareeb dedh maheene se band pade hai jo simi ke 8 aatankiyon par najar rakhane ke liye lagaae gaye the
 Now the jail administration has started repairing these CCTV cameras

 Post mortem report of the terrorists killed in the encounter has also come
 iske mutabik maare gaye aatankiyon kii qamar se upar chot ke nishaan mili hai
 In such a situation, the question arises that if the encounter was from far away then why did the bullets not hit the rest of the body or the lower parts of the room? It is clear in the pictures that eight unarmed were standing on the hill
 phir unhen jinda pakadaney kii koshish kyon nahin kii gai?4
 The terrorists are said to have fled the jail around midnight
 jail ke baahar aane par in aatankiyon kii kisi ne madad bhi kii kyonki inke kapade badale hue the or inke paas hathiyaar bhi the
 These terrorists were killed in an encounter within 8 hours of their escape from prison
 jis jagah par ye aatanki maare gaye, wo jagah bhopal jail se 10 kilometre kii duuri par he
 In such a situation, the question also arises that even when these terrorists were helpful, why did they not run more than 10 kilometers away in 8 hours? If someone came out of the jail to give them weapons, then why did he not give the car to run away? While there was a greater risk of getting caught on foot? Why did the eight terrorists run on the same path together after breaking prison? While there was the highest risk of getting caught in it? 5
 jail se bhaagane ke baad unke paas chaar katte kahaan se aae? jail ke baahar unhen katte kisne die? police kaa daawa he ki aathon vichaaradhin aatankwaadi bhi goliyaan chalaa rahe the
 In such circumstances, how were the police shooting videos on the phone instead of avoiding bullets? 6
 aamtaur par jail ke andar 70 surakshakarmiyon kii tainaati rahati he
 On the night of Diwali, 30 jail staff were also celebrating Diwali by keeping the jail manual on hold and jeopardizing the security of the jail

 And most of the inmates of the jail knew this
 jail ke 30 staff ko ek saath chuttee kyon de di gai? head consteble kii hatya kii khabar milane par bhi baaki suraksha guard ne alarm yaa city baja kar baaki ko alert kyon nahin kiya?7
 How did the three policemen get stabbed with knives during the encounter while the bullets were running there? Why are those three policemen injured during the encounter being kept in hiding? Why were they not brought to the fore? Police say the accused attacked with a sharp weapon
 magar tasviren dikhaa rahi hai ki hathiyaar bilkul saaf or chamchamata hua he
 There is no blood stain on him

 Under this, such government officials who are careless or corrupt in work, are being forced to retire
 ab dilli police ne bhi aadesh jari kar diya he ki daagi police karmiyon ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya jaae
 There is a stir in the Delhi Police after the order came on July 19 last
 yah aadesh visilence vibhaag ne dilli police kii sabhi uniton or jilon ke disipi ko bheja gaya he
 It has been written that such policemen who are accused of corruption, negligence on duty and engaging in criminal activities, should be shown the way out
 aadesh main saaf kaha gaya he ki dilli main nithlle, laaparvaah or bhrasht police waalon ko jabaran ritairement dekar ghar bhej diya jaae
 According to the order, such police personnel should be screened
 aise pulicekarmiyon kii pahchaan kii jaae
 DCP should be screened with the rank of Sub Inspector from the constable while Joint CP will be screened by Inspector rank
 visilence ne kul aath binduon ke tahat karrwai ke liye kaha he
 It will include such policemen against whom charges have been framed in any crime, they have been fined heavily due to corruption, departmental investigation is going on, continuous duty is negligent or they are addicted to drugs
 screening cametiyaan apane-apane jilon se aise police karmiyon ke naam visilence ko bhejengi or phir un par karrwai kii jaaegi
 The Delhi Police, considered the smartest police in the country, has more than 85 thousand officers and jawans
 inamen kai police vaale daagi hai
 Now on this one side there is a stir in the department and on the other side many people believe that this step will clear the image of the police
 goa ke navaniyukt mukhyamantri lakshmikant parsekar ne viklangon par aapattijanak bayaan diya he
 He said that such people are 'made up of God's negligence' and they are 'god's fault'

 God forgets to give them some things
 yah bhagwaan kii laaparvaahee he jiske liye ek bachche ko tamaam umr bhugatna padataa he
 Regarding the organizations working for such people, Parsekar said that they are correcting God's mistake
 gauratlab he ki manohar parrikar ko centre main raksha mantri banaae jane ke baad bijepi ne parsekar ko goa kaa mukhyamantri banaaya tha
 He was speaking at the opening of a film festival organized on the subject of disability

 ' jharkhand main tisare charan ke liye mangalvaar ko vot daale jaaenge
 The main contest this time is between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM)
 anya partiyaan - congress, babulal marandi kii jharkhand vikaas morcha (jeviem) or rashtriya janata dal (argedy) apana-apana astitv bachaane kii ladaai lard rahi hai
 For these three parties, saving seats won in the last elections is also a crook
 congress ke paas rajya main na koi cheharaa he, na prachaarak, na sansaadhan - ek tarah se dekha jaae to is rashtriya party ne rajya main chunaav se pehle hi aatmasamarpan kar diya he
 Now let's talk - BJP and Soren father-son party of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha
 chunaav ke pehle daur se hi donon partiyon ne ranchi shahar main prachaar-prasar main koi kasar nahin chodi he
 JMM placed advertisements and hoardings - 'we made, we will decorate
 
 
 ', jiske jawaab main ab bijepi ne kaha he, 'atal ji ne banaaya, modi ji sanvaarenge
 
 
 ' jeemem ke prachaar-prasar main lage log is baat se nishchit rup se khush dikhaai die ki bijepi jaisi rashtriya party ko bhi unke shabdon kii kaat dhundhani padi
 In fact, the BJP is also believing that since Hemant Soren has been in the government, the JMM also has no shortage of resources, hence they are attacking the BJP with more than one slogan and advertisements, and in this way the BJP Has no choice but to find his cut
 lekin vigyapanon kii is ladaai main ek baat spasht he ki jis bijepi ko congress se chunauti milani chahie thi, use kshetreey dal se takkar mil rahi he
 Now anyone can win or lose in the elections, but BJP also knows that their opponents are now attacking them by learning the ways of contesting their elections
 janata dal united (jediu) ke rashtriya adhyaksh or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko najrandaaj karte hue centre main bhaajapa sarkaar ne loksabhaa main naagarikta sanshodhan bill paarit karaayaa
 After this, now in the Rajya Sabha, the party has decided to oppose it and vote against it
 ye ghoshnaa ravivaar ko patna main party ke padaadhikariyon kii baithak ke baad party ke rashtriya mahasachiv kasee tyaagi ne kii
 Tyagi will visit Guwahati along with the party's national vice-president Prashant Kishore where the Asom Gana Parishad will interact with AASU to support their movement and formulate future run-of-the-mill
 haalanki kasee tyaagi ne naagarikta sanshodhan bill ke mudde par congress party par ye aarope lagaaya ki vah parde ke peeche se bijepi kaa samarthan kar rahi he nahin to loksabhaa main is mudde par wo bahishkaar nahin karti
 Tyagi asked the Congress party to clear its stand on the issue that in view of the Lok Sabha elections, there will be a meeting of the party's national executive in which all decisions related to the Lok Sabha elections will be taken
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main jin 70 siton par party chunaav ladegi uske sambandh main kasee tyaagi kaa kahana tha ki ravivaar kii baithak main yah faisalaa liya gaya ki party ke teen varisht netaa jinamein rajya party ke adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh, mantri lalan singh or vijendra yadav ummidavaaron ke chayan ke sambandh main faisalaa lenge
 The decision taken in connection with the citizenship amendment in the meeting on Sunday itself is clear that despite repeated intervention of the party's national president Nitish Kumar, the BJP did not listen to him and remained on his agenda, after which the party decided Did that now before the introduction of this bill in Rajya Sabha, the party's stand will be cleared

 It is worth mentioning that during the speech in FICCI, Rahul Gandhi had said that many people have expressed disappointment over the project being delayed due to lack of environmental clearance
 paryaavaran or saamaajik nuksaan nahin hona chahie, lekin faisale paardarshee samay par or uchit hone chahie
 Whether it was steel, electricity or the Ministry of Mines, complaints of delay in approvals were coming from all sides

 But these days the litchi industry here is facing government apathy
 jis kaaran bejod swaad ke liye mashr mujffarpur kii shahi lichi ab vyapaarik pratispardhaa main pichhadane lagi he
 Originally grown in the western parts of Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, East Champaran and Samastipur, it is the most distinct variety of litchi
 sarkari protsaahan ke abhaav or bhandaaran ke liye buniyadi dhaanche kii kami ne shahi lichi ke utpaadan par vipareet asar daalaa he
 It is said that Lychee first arrived in Tripura from Guangdong Dan province near Vietnam
 vahaan se assam phir bengal ke baadabihar main
 Its cultivation first started in Katihar in Bihar and after that Muzaffarpur became the main center of its production
 yahaan har saal lagbhag 2,00,000 ton lichi kaa utpaadan hota he jabaki puure bihar main iskaa utpaadan lagbhag 4,00,000 ton he
 The demand for lychee here is in America, France, England, Canada, Russia and Gulf countries
 lichi ke rakrakhaav or uchit marketing kii vyavastha nahin hone se kisaanon ko iskaa sahi laabh nahin mil paa rahaa he
 However, for good production of litchi, facilities and training of farmers, the government has also opened National Litchi Research Center

 Vishal Nath said, "the job of this center is to prepare better techniques of litchi cultivation and work for its proper maintenance
" '' beshak baaten kaaphi hai lekin dharaatal par bahut kam ko hi anjaam diya gaya he
 Litchi processing can take the form of a large industry here, which can benefit from farmers to businessmen
 lekin ab tak sarkaar ne koi thoskadam nahin uthaae jisase kisaan hataash hai
 Do not want to plant a new plant in place of the trees that dry up
 lichi ko baahar bhejne ke liye koi uchit vyavastha nahin he
 Outside businessmen purchase litchi from here and take it to places like Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Kanpur, Punjab, Haryana etc
 vahaan se videshon ko lichi bhejte hai

 There are six factories in Muzaffarpur and only ten to twelve in the whole of Bihar
 jha ne bataaya ki thailand main ek lakh ton lichi kaa utpaadan hota he or nabbe hajaar ton processing kar letaa he
 But we are unable to use even half the production
 ek lichi vyavsaayee keshav nandan ne bataaya ki uchit market nahin hone ke kaaran laagat ke anukool keemat nahin mil rahi he
 Lychee only stays here for 15 days
 kisaanon ko jaagruk nahin karne se lichi kii quality prabhavit ho rahi he
 More capital is needed to build factories
 lekin sarkaar 35 pratishat anudaan detii he
 At the same time, banks appear to shy away from giving loans
 jisase vyavsaay aage nahin bad paa rahaa he
 If the government comes forward with a positive attitude, then royal litchi can make the world go crazy with its taste

 Accusing him of having new love with the Congress, Rudy slammed Nitish for calling him "secular" when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called Nitish secular for his support during a vote of confidence in the Bihar Legislative Assembly and severed ties with the BJP on Wednesday
 It should be known that Singh comes from the same party responsible for killing about five thousand people in the 1984 Sikh riots

 He said that in early 2000, during a meeting with the leaders of his party, Nitish had described Narendra Modi as an emerging leader in the BJP and said that he came from the poor backward caste and in a newspaper JDU An article by Prem Kumar Mani, a former leader of the state, was also published last year

 Rudy said that BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi, who was entitled to the post, had pushed Nitish forward, while some leaders of his own party were opposing Nitish's appointment as chief minister
 rudi ne kaha ki nitish ke avasarwaadi rukh ko bijepi ne usee samay bhaanp liya tha jab unke dal ke logon ne pichley raashtrapati chunaav ke dauraan congress ke ummidavaar ke paksh main matdaan kiya

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been shouting 'beti Bachao' in every speech, but it is sad and shameful that Divya Pharmacy, a company close to him, is selling drugs to produce son
 guuruuvaar ko jediu netaa kasee tyaagi ne rajyasabha main is babat mudda uthaaya, jiske baad sadan main jamkar hangaamaa hua
 Meanwhile, Baba Ramdev has said that this is a conspiracy to malign his Patanjali Yogpeeth
 sadan kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi tyaagi ne 'putrajeevak beej' kaa packet dikhaate hue iskaa virodh kiya, jiske baad jaya bachchan, javed akhtar samet kai saansadon ne sur main sur mila liye
 Interestingly, the Haryana government has recently appointed Ramdev as the brand ambassador of the state and the Prime Minister also started his Beti Bachao Abhiyan from Haryana itself
 haalanki is puure masale par bijepi kuch bhi bolne se batch rahi he
 Cabinet Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that the government would like to gather more information in this matter, while Health Minister JP Nadda said that this is a serious matter and the government will take appropriate action in this regard
 2007 main vivaad ke baad badal diya namdivy farmesi kii dawa ko lekar vivaad nayaa nahin he
 In the past, there has been a lot of controversy in the Patanjali Yogpeeth about selling the drug named 'putravati'
 2007 main uttarakhand sarkaar ke aadesh par maamle kii jaanch bhi kii gai thi, jiske baad is dawa ko bechnaa band kar diya gaya tha
 However, on the website of Patanjali Yogpeeth, the name of the drug of having a son has been clearly recorded in the list of medicines
 vivaad ke baad divya farmesi kii is dawa kaa naam badalakar 'putravati' kii jagah 'putrajeevak beej' kar diya gaya
 However, there has been no claim on this medicine anywhere that it is a medicine to get a son
 site par di gai jaankaree main sirf itnaa likhaa he- prasav sambandhi samasyaon or infertility ke liye
 But on the website, this drug has been suggested as an advice in response to the online question of those who want a son
 kya aapako bhi aisa lagata he ki ek ore jahaan aap is relationships ko ek kadam or aage le jane ke bare main soch rahe hai vahiin aapkaa partner is maamle ko lekar bilkul shant he?kya aapako bhi aisa mahasoos hota he aapaki tulana main aapkaa partner is rishte ko lekar kaaphi laaparvaah he? agar haa to, ye aapke liye chintaa kii baat he
 But this thing is not even 100 percent true, because often boys take time in such cases
 ho saktaa he kiek ore jahaan aap is rishte ko aage lekar janaa chaahate hon vahiin aapkaa partner is rishte ko us nazariye se nahin dekhtaa ho
 If you also doubt your partner's intention or if you do not understand his behavior, then you can guess the thing going on in his mind with these four symptoms
 1
 Apart from both of you, no third is aware that both of you are dating each other
if the relationship between you is really serious, then your partner will definitely introduce you to your family and friends
 par agar usne abhi tak aisa nahin kiya he to ho na ho kuch gadabad to jarur he
 If he still introduces you to people only by telling him friends, then it is important for you to become aware
 2
 Does your partner also get lost somewhere during the stay and then comes back on his own
 Whenever you plan to go somewhere, does your partner also start counting you due to not being involved in it? Does he not reply to you even after several messages? Yafir he answers your phone call only after one or two days? If yes, this condition is not true in any way
 kya aapke saath aisa bhi hota he ki aapkaa partner ekaek aapke prati bahut bhavuk ho jaataa he or kisi din achaanak se hi aapako bin bataae gaayab ho jaataa he? agar aapke rishte main bhi aisa kuch chal rahaa he to yah aapke liye sanbhal jane kaa samay he
 3
 kya aapke partner ko aapse kisi saarvajanik jagah par milane main hichkichaahat hoti hekya aapkaa partner aapse ghar par milane ke liye to turant raji ho jaataa he par jab aap use kisi hotel yaa saarvajanik jagah par bulaati hai to wo naaraaz ho jaataa he?agar haa, to ab ye samajhane main der nahin karen ki vah is rishte ko gambhirtha se nahin dekhtaa he
 4
 bhavishya kii yojanaon par baat karne main kataranajab do log sachche dil se kisi rishte main bandhe hote hai or use aage lekar jane kii baat sochate hai to unke paas bhavishya kii yojanaon ko lekar kai tarah kii baaten or vichaar hote hai
 But if your partner is not even interested in talking to you about future plans, then understand that it is good for you to break away from him
