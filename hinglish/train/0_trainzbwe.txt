 lekin kendriya soochna ayog ke aadesh ko dilli hai court ne khaarij karte hue mana he ki iviem soochna ke daayre se baahar he

 script:film kii kahani kaaphi kamjor he, jahanfirst half kaaphi dhilaa haveheen interval ke baad kaa hissaa to or bhi hilaa dula he, haalanki sanjay mishra or ritesh ke samvaad aapako kahin-kahin jarur hansaate hai lekin naam ke anusaar film main bahut sari kamiyaan hai
 Acting: Ritesh Deshmukh's acting looks very good while Usha Nadkarini ji playing the role of Sanjay Mishra and Ritesh's mother-in-law has done a great job
 vivek oberoi, aftab shivadsaani, urvashi rotela, puja bose, mishti, shraddha das or baaki logon ne bhi thik abhinay kiya he
 However the casting could have been even better
 film main shreyash talapade ke saath saath sudesh lahari or sonaali raut kaa bhi chemiyo he
 Weak link: The weak link of the film is its script and weak casting, which could have been improved
 sangeet:film kaa sangeet thik he lekin kahani se zyada gane sunai padate hai, jisko kam kiya jaataa to film or bhi crisp lagati
 Why see: If you ever come on TV, then it will be better to save money this weekend

 Rahul Gandhi says that during the discussion on the no-confidence motion, PM Modi's heart once again showed hatred, fear and anger about our people
 rahul ne twit main likhaa, 'piem modi sansad main apana varchasv dikhaane ke liye ek baar phir hamaare logon ke khilaaf ghrinaa, bhay or krodh kii baaten karte dikhe'
 However, Rahul believes that only the language of love can win the hearts of all Indians and this will make the country strong
 The point of yesterday’s debate in Parliament
 
 PM uses Hate, Fear and Anger in the hearts of some of our people to build his narrative
 We are going to prove that Love and Compassion in the hearts of all Indians, is the only way to build a nation

 Anti National, Urban Naxal, Anti Modi, Crumbling Gang, Khan Market Gang
 inhen rose public main thela gaya or yakeen dilaayaa gaya ki sarkaar se sawaal karne vaale logon kaa bachaa-khuchaa samooh urban naksal he
 There is danger for the country and the Prime Minister
 phir yahi shabdaawaliyaan whatsap ke zarie un saadhaaran gharon tak pahunchaa di gayi jinhen pataa bhi nahin tha ki naksal kya he or urban naksal kya he
 When Gauri Lankesh was killed, she too came to be called Urban Naxal

 Four-five faces were shown, next to them the Urban Naxal
 rahul gandhi ke chaukeedaar chor he kehane par pradhanmantri kaa main bhi chaukeedaar abhiyaan master stroke kehalaata he

" tarkwaadiyon ke kilaaf bebuniyaad aarope lagaae ja rahe hai
 This is not the logical way
 yah daraavna he kyonki unhen lagata he ki ve jo chaahe kar sakate hai

 "this is what Girish Karnad told the media
 urban naksal 2014 ke baad ke rashtriya media ke neshnal silebus kaa vahi chapter he jo sirf pehle panne par shuru hota he or usee par khatm hota he
 In this syllabus of one page, when one gets filled up by saying Urban Naxal, then someone is called anti-national, when it gets filled with being called anti-national, then for a short time it is called as a traitor in Hindi, when a traitor When the mind fills then it starts being called anti-hindu, when it gets filled with the anti-hindu, it starts being called anti-modi

 While giving a speech in Jagdalpur, Prime Minister Modi says that "urban Maoists who live in AC houses in cities, look clean, make a good place to sit in a good number of people, their children study abroad, good good They roam in vehicles, but by sitting there, the remote system serves to destroy the lives of tribal children
 ''yah bhi note karen ki pradhanmantri modi ne ek urban naksal ke nidhan par shradhanjali di he
 He has remembered his contributions
 girish karnad videsh main padhakar bharat aae or yahaan rahakar rachaa
 Sitting in AC room and also in non AC room
 kitni aasaani se sarkaron ne apni naakaami ek nae anjaan se gadhe jumale ke hawaale kar di

 media main aa rahi khabaron ke anusaar bailadila kii 13 khadaan adani ko bechney ke virodh main pachaas hazaar adivasee apane gharon se nikle hai
 Is any anchor screaming for these tribals on their channel? There is a case of Adani, so no one will even ask the Congress government
 bijepi bhi adivaasiyon ke haq main andolan nahin karegi
 In the area of the fifth schedule, the rights and lands of the tribals were also looted earlier
 pehle bhi unki awaz kaa pratinidhitiv nahin tha
 There will be no more
 girish karnad kii viraasat par hamaari likhaai bahut choti pad jaaegi
 His legacy is the cultural heritage of India which has always been proud of its diversity

 Someone thought of killing him
 us samaaj or media main unhen kaise shradhanjali di ja rahi he, mujhe nahin pataa
 i do not watch news channels
 main maanata hum ki news channel bharat ke loktantr kii vividhta kii hatya kar rahe hai
 While watching the channel, note that what are they talking about Girish Karnad, and showing the footage of which film
 unke paas is mahaan shaks ke bare main aapako bataane ke liye kya kya intervyuu hai, kya kya vijual hai
 Look at these questions, you will be convinced that the channels are neither interested in you nor Girish was in Karnad
 iske baavjood anek log girish karnad ko yaad kar rahe hai
 He did not know Girish Karnad through any news channel and its loafer anchors
 wo kai dashakon tak unke likhe naatakon ko padhate rahe, naatakon ke manchan ko dekhte rahe, manchan karte rahe, unki filmon ko dekhte rahe
 Then he learned what it means to be Girish Karnad
 unhen yaad karne vaale is vakt main bharose kaa sabase bada kaaran hai
 Even now everything is not erased due to channels
 girish karnad kii yaaden urban naksal propeganda kii sazishon ke baad bhi alag hai
 Where their originality, talent and creativity rule
 ek mahaan shaks kii vidaai se pehle yaad kiijie ki unke aakhri din kin vivaadon main guzare or un vivaadon kii prishthbhumi kya thi

 aaj vakt or halaat ne aise siyaasi mode par laakar khadaa kar diya he ki vahi sarathi unase juda ho gaya
 While Sharad has always been a shield for Nitish in these 13 years, whether Lalu was talking about snatching the throne of power or walking a different path from the NDA in the name of Modi
 kaise bani thi jediudarasal mukhyamantri bihar kii satta se lalu prasad yadav ko bedakhal karne ke liesharad yadav, nitish kumaar or ram vilaas paswan ek jute hue
 Nitish Kumar's Samata Party, headed by George Fernandes and Paswan's Lokshakti Party, joined Sharad Yadav's Janata Dal and then the Janata Janata Dal (united)
 isamen samta party kaa chunaav nishaan tir ko liya gaya or party va jhanda sharad yadav kii janata dal ke naam par jedyu rakhaa gaya
 While Paswan separated after a few days and formed his own party LJP separately, Sharad Yadav did not leave Nitish
 nitish ko mila tha sharad kaa saharabihar kii sattake singhaasana par kabiz hone ke liye nitish kumaar ne sharad yadav ke majboot kandhon kaa sahaara liya tha
 After this, he also joined hands with BJP and broke the political politics of Lalu Prasad Yadav in October 24, 2005 and took the key of power of the state
 dhaal bane rahe sharad yadavanithish ke har kadam par sharad saath khadey rahe, unke raajnneetik sarathi banakar unhen sahaara dete rahe
 While Nitish Kumar was in charge of the politics of Bihar, Sharad would work in his image through the political corridors and media of Delhi
 yahi nahin sharad ke jariye nitish kumaar muslim maton or yadav maton ko jodne main kaamyaab hue hai
 Whereas earlier both of these used to be with the vote bank of the community
 jedyu kaa bijepi ke saath hone ke baavjood muslim or yadavon kaa bada tabaka unke saath jud gaya tha
 Due to which Lalu's RJD started taking last breath in the state
 modi ke naam par hi alag hue thesitambar 2013 main bihar kii siyasat ne nai karavat lee
 It was at this time that when BJP announced the name of Narendra Modi for the post of Prime Minister, Nitish Kumar broke his ties
 nitish kumaar pichley 13 saal se endie ke saath hai
 He was a minister in the Atal government
 aise mushkil vakt main sharad yadav aage kar modha thama
 Sharad became Nitish Kumar's shield by laying a political check in Delhi
 sharad yadav ne saaf kiya ki hamaari party line secular he agar modi aate he, to ham bijepi ke is line par saath nahin chal sakate
 Whereas there was no talk of political supremacy between Sharad and Modi
 vahiin nitish or modi ke bich siyaasi varchasv kii jang jarur thi
 Despite this, Sharad stood in defense of Nitish
 ek sachche sarathi ke naate wo saath dete rahe
 Now, due to Modi, the NDA won 33 out of 40 seats in Bihar in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 nitish kii party sirf do siton par simatakar rah gai
 In such a situation, when the crisis of saving his existence stood in front of Nitish, Sharad Yadav again became his charioteer
 sharad ne lalu prasad yadav ke jariye milakar phir bihar main mahagathbandhan bana
 Nitish retained power by defeating the BJP in the 2015 state elections
 lekin july 2017 main lalu or nitish ke bich daraar ho gai phir ve bhrashtachar ke maamle kaa aarope lagaakar lalu kaa saath chhod diya or bijepi se haath mila liya
 They are also going to be part of the NDA of the Center
 sharad is khabar se bekhar the
 For this reason, Sharad raised the flag of revolt against Nitish
 aise main nitish kaa 13 saal purana sarathi juda ho gaya
 That is, where Nitish broke his 13-year friendship with BJP, he has also left his 13-year-old partner now

 bharat ne guuruuvaar ko hi do wicket par 190 ran banaakar match bachaane kii taraf majbootee se kadam badhaaye the
 The Indians, however, batted very slowly on the fifth day and in the final session, everyone was interested only in Tendulkar's century

 The second Test match will be played in Kanpur from 24 November

 Tendulkar played 211 balls and hit 11 fours for his century, while Laxman faced 160 balls and sent the ball across the boundary line five times
 match bachaane kii bhartiya kavayad main haalanki gambhir ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai jo isse pehle isi saal march-april main newjiland ke khilaaf nepier (137) or wellington test (167 ran) main team ke liye taaranhar banakar utre the

 He could not give up the greed of a long shot off Herath's well-tossed ball and returned to the pavilion after catching Dhammika Prasad at mid-off

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi today took a direct attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha, accusing him that the Pakistan government which had spread the terrorism, which was the most widely disseminated in the world, was put in a cage by the UPA government

 Before taking this step, Rahul alleged that Modi did not think it right to ask anyone
 na sena se, na kootneetikon or rajanyikon se or shaayad videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj se bhi nahin
 His idea of values is everything
 ' He said, 'the Prime Minister single-handedly ended our efforts
 hamane pakistan ko jis pinjre main daal diya tha, usase unhone use nikaal diya
 By doing this he respected and insulted the flag of the country

 Ram Naik has said that Ram temple in Ayodhya should be built soon
 agra ke dharmantaran masale par rajyapal ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar ko isaki jaanch kerani hogi
 Ram Naik, who came to a convocation in Faizabad, said, “ram temple should be built as soon as possible
 yah logon kii ichha he or yah ichha puri honi chahie
 a political uproar has started on Naik's statement
 trinmul congress ne is masale ko aaj sansad main uthaane kii dhamkee di he
 At the same time, the UP Minorities Commission has sought a report from the district administration on the incident of conversion in Agra
 ayog ne prashasan se teen din ke bheetar jawaab maanga he
 Meanwhile, the district administration and Dharm Jagran Samiti have come face to face with the conversion program to be held on 25th in Aligarh

 Opposition was angered by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu's reply

 He also expressed pride in being associated with the Sangh
 congress kii ore se jyotiraditya sindhiya ne morcha sambhala
 He asked the Prime Minister to clarify the entire matter
 vahiin, sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ne dharmantaran par hangaame ko lekar hairaani jataai
 He said that when there is no uproar in Agra then why is it happening here (in Parliament)? bhartiya janata party ke netritv vaale morche kii 19 may ko assam vidhansabha chunaav main hui baari jeet ko 48 ghante bhi nahin beete the ki party adhyaksh amit shah party mukhyalay 11, ashok road sthit apane karyaalay main ek baithak le rahe the
 His mood was upbeat with the victory, it would be an understatement to say that his recent victory in Assam was an ointment for the BJP over the wounds he suffered in Bihar last November
 shah ne 9 agast, 2014 ko party adhyaksh ke bataur apane pehle sambodhan main assam ko bijepi kii jholii main daalane kaa vaada kiya tha
 This victory brought great relief for Shah
 iske baavjood is baithak main shah or unke sahyogiyon ne assam par koi charchaa nahin kii, balki unki nigaah kshitij ke paar thi—ve agle saal hone vaale uttar pradesh or punjab ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye ranneeti gadhane main jute the or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ke liye duusare kaarykaal ko sunishchit karne par baat kar rahe the
 The dose of Assam Fatah is so encouraging that there should be no doubt about these strategies
 bihar kii haar ke baad amit shah thode naram pad gaye the
 It was also easy to reach them
 bijepi adhyaksh ke rup main unki duusari pari adhar main lataki najar aa rahi thi
 His aggression has now returned
 2014 main ‘‘congress-mukt bharat’’ kaa jumala gadhane vaale shah ne ek baar phir matganana ke din 19 may ko ise apane virodhiyon par uchhaalate hue media main bayaan diya, ‘‘yah desh congress-mukt bharat ke sapane se bas do kadam dur he
 "there is no doubt which party will fill the vacant space of the Congress
" unhone india today ko bataaya, ‘‘bijepi ab akhil bhartiya party ban chuki he
 Today we are present from Kutch to Kamrup and Kashmir to Kanyakumari
 ’’chunavi jang kii nai mashinchunaav ke baad party or sarkaar main asann badlaav par jo fusfusaahat thi, vah ab khulkar saamne aa gai he
 Immediately after Assam's mandate, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Shah are believed to have held an important meeting in which a blueprint for deepening has been formed for the first time since the NDA came to power two years ago
 
 shah ke liye kaam karne vaale swatantra shodharthiyon kii ek team ne cabinet mantriyon ke kaamkaaj kaa moolyankan kiya he
 Ministers who do not show results will probably be sent as governors, there is scope for change of state ministers as well and it is possible that state units will be given new charge
 is khaake ko antim rup aane vaale hafton main diya jayega jab shah nai team kaa gathan karenge
 With this reorganization, a new shape of BJP and government will emerge for the electoral battle, which is most likely to remain unchanged till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 12 or 13 june ko party kii kaaryakarini kii baithak paanch saal main pehali baar uttar pradesh ke elahabaad main hone ja rahi he
 The strategy for the elections of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab will be finalized next year in this executive
 is 26 may ko party maheene bhar tak chalane vaala ek prachaar abhiyaan shuru karegi
 It will not be as much a celebration of the completion of two years of the NDA as the beginning of its election campaign
 party ke kaaryakarta samaaj ke vibhinn tabakon ke saath desh bhar kii 200 jagahon par samvaad karenge
 These places have been chosen according to the maximum political impact
 kaaryakartaaon se kaha gaya he ki ve yuvaaon, mahilaon or aarthik rup se kamjor tabakon samet janata ko sarkaar kii yojanaon kii jaankaree den
 a three-member team of party workers will monitor the reach of the workers at all 200 places
 is nai ranneeti ke peeche kii chaalak shakti modi-shah kii puraani jodi hi rahegi, baavjood iske ki donon ke najariyon main maamuli matbhed he
 For example, Shah is a supporter of staunch Hindutva, while Modi adopts a slightly finer attitude in this matter
 party ke bheetar shah ek aise ranneetikaar hai jo mahasachivon se milane vaali soochnaaon par ashrith hai
 Modi only gives his final opinion on sensitive issues like changing the Chief Minister
 masalan, 200 sthanon tak pahunchane kaa nuskhaa shah ne modi ko diya tha jinhone is par muhar laga di
 Shah's routine is still very busy — by January he had traveled an average of 465 kilometers a day and had traveled to all 31 states of India
 bihar kaa sabakpichley november main bihar kii haar bijepi ke liye ek chetavanee thi
 More than what he had to face in Delhi, Bihar worked to bring the party's weaknesses to the surface when the party faced a united opposition
 is haar ne party ke star prachaarak narendra modi par bhi ashanka khadi kar di jinhone pichley aktubar main rajya main takreeban 40 jansabhaon ko sambodhit kiya tha
 Taking a lesson from its defeat, the party devised a strategy which it called the "assam Model"
 yahaan party ne dilli or bihar kii tarj par mukhar chunaav prachaar nahin kiya or nijee hamalon se bachane kii koshish kii
 The same scheme is now proposed to be implemented in other states where water will be measured before going into the electoral battle carefully
 masalan, assam main bijepi ne avaidh ghuspaithiyon kaa masalaa ek seemaa se zyada nahin uthaaya
 In the recent elections, for the first time, he put forward a local face and already declared Sarbananda Sonowal as the Chief Ministerial candidate
 nitish-lalu kii jodi ne bihar banaam bahari kaa jo jumala uchhaala tha, usne bhi bijepi ko ek sabak diya
 That is, bringing star campaigners from outside in the electoral state can prove to be harmful
 yah jamini kaaryakartaaon ke bich ek galat kism kaa bhram or utsaah paidaa karata he, jo yah maanane lag jate hai ki ek jansabha hi chunaav jeetne ke liye kaaphi he
 This time Modi and Shah made only three trips to Assam during the campaign, Rajnath went there twice and Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj made only one trip
 jamini kaaryakartaaon ko janata ke saath sampark ke vyapak kaaryakramon ke liye mukt rakhaa gaya
 The party has also decided that it will not expose Modi excessively
 isse 2019 kii badi jang ke liye unhen bachaae rakhaa ja sakegaa
 The party has no hesitation in bringing leaders from other parties, as it has shown by bringing Hemant Biswa Sarma from the Assam Congress
 party ke ek aalaa netaa kehete hai, ‘‘chunaav jeetna vichaardhaara se zyada vyaavhaarikta kaa masalaa hota he
 a rare example of this pragmatism occurred when the party leadership ignored the interference of the Assam unit of the RSS
 yah baat alag he ki 2014 kii kamyaabi ko aage dohraane ke liye party aresas kaa istemaal chunaavon main jarur karegi
 Shah is currently cashing in on good relations between RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and Modi due to which differences between the Sangh and the government are being avoided
 sabhi aagaamee chunaavon ke liye bijepi ne paanch sutri ranneeti taiyaar kii he—bhrashtachar mukt prashasan, jan dhan jaisi yojanaon ke madhyam se aarthik shashaktikaran, pradhanmantri mudra yojana, stand-ap india or start-ap india jaisi yojanaon ke madhyam se aarthik tarakkee, kam kishton vaali do jivan beemaa or durghatana beemaa yojanaon ke madhyam se aarthik suraksha or antat, manaregaa ko rashtriya parisampatti nirmaan ke saath jodakar tikaoo aarthik vruddhi
 The plan of 100 seats for 2019 believes that the bjp's growth in the northern states of Vindhya has ended where it won 220 out of 282 Lok Sabha seats
 inamen uttar pradesh main 80 main se 71 siten, gujarat kii kul 26 siten, rajasthan kii kul 25 siten or madhya pradesh kii 29 main se 27 siten bijepi ke paas ai thim
 It would be a more optimistic approach to maintain confidence in these states for the 2019 victory
 isiilie amit shah ne ek nuskhaa nikaala haih yah 100 seat kii yojana he
 They now have a new target: from the Brahmaputra Valley of Assam to the Malabar Coast of Kerala covering West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh
 ye sab milakar loksabhaa kii kul 205 siten banaate hai lekin inhen rajyon main bijepi kaa aadhaar kamjor he
 It had only 9 seats here - seven in Assam and two in West Bengal in 2014
 shah kaa maananaa he ki party agar ekajute hokar kaam kare to in rajyon main uske haath sone kii khan lag sakati he
 In these states, the party will broaden its base in the next two years by using a combination of election-oriented programs and a strong leadership
 assam main kendriya bhoomika nibhaane vaale party ke mahasachiv ram madhav party kii sambhaavnaaon ko lekar utsahit hai
 In recent assembly elections they point to increased vote percentage
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘agar ham rajyon ke chunaavon main 2011 ke 11 fisadi se 43 fisadi tak or pashchim bengal main gathbandhan sahyogiyon ke saath milakar 4
 We have been able to increase the vote percentage from 1 percent to 15 percent, so we have every reason to be confident
 ’’upi kii chunautiagale saal uttar pradesh or punjab ke chunaavon ko lekar shah kaaphi satark hai or hamale tathaa bachaav kii dotarafa niti par kaam kar rahe hai
 In Punjab, he is looking for a way to bring the anti-incumbency environment built in a decade
 iske alaava chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh main ashanka he ki 2018 ke chunaavon main bijepi ko kuch nuksaan ho kyonki yahaan vah 13 saal se raaj kar rahi he
 Uttar Pradesh, however, differs in that the party has been out of power since 2002 and it is here that its electoral strategy is to be tested the most
 loksabhaa chunaav main to modi kii lahar or sujh-boojh bhare tikat vitaran ke sahare shah ne 80 main se 71 siten nikaal lee thim
 If they lose in UP, the dream of winning in 2019 will be questioned
 isiilie ve yahaan kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar dikhte hai
 The party's mission UP began on May 1 when Modi launched his government's ambitious Prime Minister Ujjwala Yojana from here

 The state unit has been transformed into a backward caste based organization
 rajya main navaniyukt 90 jila adhyakshon main 44 pichhadi jatiyon ke netaa hai or chaar dalit hai
 While playing the backward card, however, Shah and Mathur will have to keep in mind that they should not forget the Brahmins on whom Mayawati is again putting her head
 samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ke kathith duraachaaron ke bainks modi sarkaar ke svachh shashan or sushasan ko bhi khadaa karne kii yojana he
 Under the plan to target youth and women, bjp's state unit has made a total of 1 in the state

 aisa kahana he ki dilli ke fatehpuri masjid ke imam doctor mufti mohammad mukarram ahamed kaa
 Imam Jamiat ulema-e-hind leader of Fatehpuri Mosque does not agree with the statement of Mahmud Madani in which he said that Congress is showing fear of Modi for getting Muslim votes
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe nahin lagata ki mahmud madani ne sahi kaha
 i did not hear that any Congress leader tried to take advantage of Narendra Modi by showing fear
 agar madani ji ke paas aisi jaankaree he to kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ko aisa nahin karnaa chahie
 At first i do not think that Modi can ever become the PM of this country

 The struggle in the ruling Samajwadi Party in UP may have stopped, but the latest poster war has again brought it to the fore
 ek taraf janeshwar mishra park main samaajawaadee party ke 25 saal puraa hone par bhavy aayojan kii taiyaariyaan kii ja rahi hai jiske karta dharta shivpal yadav hai
 On the other hand, in front of the Chief Minister's residence, in the ground of La Martiniere School, Akhilesh Yadav's team is busy with Ji Jaan to make the Rath Yatra a grand and spectacular event

 netaaon ke bich hode lag gai he ki zyada se zyada binar poster chhapava kar apane number badhayen jaaen
 If the posters and hoardings are considered as weapons in the midst of the chaos of Shivpal and Akhilesh, then it can be said that at the moment, Akhilesh Yadav seems to be far ahead

 According to the reports so far, Shivpal Yadav will also be present there to give the message that despite differences, the Samajwadi Party is one
 isi tarah akhilesh yadav rath yatra ko bich main roak kar 5 taarikh ko party ke rajat jayanti samaaroh main bhi hissaa lenge

 But we also saw such attacks on Namvar Singh, behind which the intention was to show him prestige

 However, at the moment wish Namvar Singh to be healthy

 notebandi se kaledhan par lagaam lagegi, is ummid par beete 48 dinon se jari kavayad par sawaal uth rahe hai
 If there is a wealth of black money in the country, its source is government department, government employees and small and big businessmen of the country
 in sab ko jodne vaali kadi khud desh ke rajaneta or unke raajnneetik dal hai
 Therefore, to curb black money, it is necessary to first stop the legal provisions which ignore the earnings of political parties
 idi ne is bich bahujan samaaj party ke ek khate main 104 karod rupee jamaa hone or mayawati ke bhai ke benami sampatti kii jaanch shuru kii he
 Amid the exercise to curb black money through demonetisation in the country, the Election Commission has demanded from the government that political parties need to cover the amount received from donations
 bina is kavayad ke desh se kaledhan ko khatm karne kii sabhi koshish vifal hongi
 - The law of the country completely exempts income tax on the earning of political parties
 raajnneetik dalon ko di gai is chhot ke peeche inakam tex act 1961 kaa section 13 e he
 According to this law, political parties will not be taxed on house and property, money-gain or earnings from declared and anonymous donations
 - raajnneetik dalon ke liye bana kanoon ripregentshan of pipul act 1951 kaa section 29si raajnneetik dalon ko chande main milane vaali rakam par mahaj aanshik pratibandh lagaataa he
 This law says that any political party will have to give details of anonymous donations received in excess of Rs 20,000 to the Election Commission
 is rakam se kam praapt hua chanda raajnneetik dalon ke liye mahaj anya aay hi rahegi
 - Now the Election Commission has appealed the intention of political parties to curb the use of black money, that no political party should be allowed to receive anonymous donations of more than Rs 2,000
 - chunaav ayog kii yah peshkash kendra sarkaar dwaara loksabhaa ko yah soochna ki notebandi ke baad kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ko bank main jamaa karaae gaye 500 or 1000 rupee kii karency kii jaanch nahin hogi ke baad aayaa
 Now, according to the current law and the instructions for depositing the banned 500 and 1000 rupees currency after the ban, any registered political party can easily deposit any amount of money in the bank
 - raajnneetik dalon dwaara jamaa karai gai pratibandhit karency yadi 20,000 rupee se kam he to unhen iskaa byora chunaav ayog ko dene kii jarurat nahin he
 At the same time, if they deposit crores of rupees as donations, then they will not be taxed
 inakam tex kanoon unki puri aay ko tex free kar chukaa he
 Here political parties have direct connection to black money
 - notebandi ke elaan ke baad desh main jiskaa bhi kalaadhan bank main nahin pahunch saktaa he unke liye ise raajnneetik dalon ko guptadan dene kaa sabase bahatar vikalp he
 If he wants to get a decision in favor of the ruling political parties in his own interest, or withdraw some money in the new currency in lieu of the amount donated
 - raajnneetik dalon ko di gai is chhot ke peeche inakam tex act 1961 kaa section 13 e he
 According to this law, political parties are not taxed on house and property, money gains or donations earned
 beete 48 dinon kii notebandi kii kavayad se yah saaf he ki isse raajnneetik dalon ko koi nuksaan nahin hua he
 He is still free to hide and pursue the source of black money in the country
 ab chunaav ayog bhi maan rahaa he ki raajnneetik dalon ko mili rahi is chhot main paardarshita laane kii jarurat he
 Is it not the omission of the Modi government that it needed to repair its house (political parties) before starting the demonetization exercise? Was there no need to close the way for political parties to accumulate black money before demonetisation? madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal main dakshinpanthi sanghathan ke ek netaa ne apane teen saathiyon ke saath sharaab ke nashe main dhut hokar ek shaks ko apni esayuvi car se saream kuchal diya

 After the Pulwama attack, the government seems to get political benefit from the aggressive attitude against Pakistan, but now if the issue of reservation is not dealt with immediately by the government, then it may have to suffer huge losses
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle essi, asti or obisi kii naaraazgi sarkaar ko baari pad sakati he
 In view of this, brainstorming has started in the government and ordinance can be brought to improve the reservation system of SC / ST and OBC in higher education institutions
 gauratlab he ki ucch shikshan sansthaanon main 13 point roster vaale aarakshan kii nai vyavastha ke virodh main mangalvaar yani aaj kai sanghathanon ne bharat band yojit kiya he
 Tomorrow is March 6, the last meeting of the cabinet on Wednesday, because the Lok Sabha elections are to be announced after this
 isse pehle hi piem modi ko is masale par nirnay lenaa hoga ki supreme court ke 22 janvari, 2019 ke aadesh ko palatate hue adhyadesh laayaa jaae yaa nahin
 According to sources, the government can bring an ordinance in this regard that institute-wise reservation should be implemented instead of department-wise in universities
 antim cabinet baithak main sarkaar kai mahatvapurn faisle le sakati he
 In this meeting itself, the government can allocate an additional fund of Rs 4,000 crore to implement 10 per cent reservation for providing reservation to the general class poor in higher educational institutions
 asal main elahabaad hai court ne shikshan sansthaanon main khaali essi / asti post ko bharne ke liye 13 point roster ke saath santhaan waar aarakshan lagu karne kaa aadesh diya tha, jabaki pehle yah aarakshan vibhagavar tay hota tha
 The Central Government of Allahabad High Court had challenged in the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court had also rejected this challenge in its order
 elahabaad hoicourt ke aadesh ke mutabik ujisi ne circular jari kar sabhi ucch shikshan sansthaaon main vibhagavar kii jagah santhaan waar aarakshan lagu karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 This circular increased anger in SAC / ST and OBC category
 gusse ko dekhte hue centre sarkaar ne kendriya saamaajik nyaay mantri thavarchand gahalot se is bare main ek bill taiyaar karne ko kaha or disambar tak unhone 'kendriya shikshan santhaan sidhi bhartee bill' taiyaar bhi kar liya
 But this bill remained in abeyance
 aarakshan ke masale par savarnon kii naaraazgi ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne is saal janvari main saamaanya varg ke garibon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan kaa bill bhi paarit kara liya
 Dalits and backward classes are very angry about the new system of reservation and they want immediate action in this matter from the government
 unka kahana he ki nai vyavastha main dalit-pichhadon kii bhartee main 50 fisadi tak kii giravat ai he
 The dilemma BJP will make the balance BJP is in a lot of dilemma in this matter
 ek taraf chunaav ke ahm maukey par use dalit-pichhadon kii naaraazgi ko dur karnaa he, to duusari taraf yah dekhnaa he ki savarna bhi isse naaraaz na hon
 a senior BJP leader said, "if the government brings a bill for reservation of Dalits and Backwards, then the benefit of 10% reservation given to the poor of the general class will be wasted
 'isliye sarkaar santulan banane kaa kadam uthaa sakati he
 That is, on the one hand, an ordinance will be brought to improve the reservation system of the dalit-backward and on the other side a provision of Rs 4,000 crore will be made to implement 10 percent reservation for the general class
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri (hrd)prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha tha ki shikshan sansthaaon main 10 fisadi aarakshan ko july, 2019 satr se hi lagu kiya jayega or iske liye siton main kareeb 25 fisadi kii badhat kii jaaegi

 ) In Saudi Arabia, the 90-year-old man remarried, honoring his wife's last wish
 samachaarpatr gulf news ke mutabik pashchimi saudi arab ke taif main rahane vaaleen fatis al thakaphi kii paanch betiyon ne apane pita ke liye yogya vadhoo khojane main teen maah lagaae
 Thakafi, who lost his wife after a long illness earlier this year, had previously refused to remarry
 lekin maa kii is ichha ke bare main betiyon or putron dwaara dabaav daalane par vah dobaaraa shaadi ke liye maan gaye
 The 90-year-old father has five daughters and 7 sons
 betiyaan apane vruddh pita ke liye jawan kii bajaay ek paripakv mahila chaahati thi
 Eventually, she found a 53-year-old childless widow living in the village, who accepted the marriage proposal
 vruddh ko apni nai dulhan ke liye 25,000 saudi riyal (6,665 dollar) chukaane pade
 a large number of acquaintances and friends attended this wedding ceremony
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp he ki jo log ab tak saamaajik aadhaar par aarakshan ko pratibha ke vilom kii tarah dekhte rahe or ise bhartiya vyavastha kaa nasoor maanate rahe, ve apil kar rahe hai ki garibon ke haq kii khaatir yah aarthik aarakshan maan liya jaae - bina yah bataae ki har maheene 65,000 rupee kamaane vaale log kis kasuti se garib kehlaayenge
 They are just in favor of applying 10 percent economic reservation to the poor as soon as possible in jobs and education
 nijee kshetra kii naukariyon or shaikshik sansthaaon main bhale ab tak kisi bhi tarah kaa saamaajik aarakshan lagu na ho paaya ho, lekin ab vahaan bhi aarthik aarakshan dene kii hadabadi dikh rahi he
 Some state governments have also decided to implement it as soon as the law of reservation on economic basis is passed
 or ab maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha he ki desh ke 900 sarkari vishvavidhyalayon or 40,000 collejon main aarthik aarakshan bilkul isi saal se lagu ho jayega
 Not only this, legislation will be introduced in about 350 private universities and more than 25,000 colleges to implement the reservation system from this year
 prakaash jaavdekar yaheen nahin ruke, unhone do or ghoshnaaen kar daaleen
 He said that 25 percent seats will be increased in all these places, so that there is no impact on the already existing reservation
 iske liye in sansthaanon kii kshamta bhi badhaai jaaegi
 One by one, see the truth behind all these announcements
 jin sarkari sansthaanon main 10 fisadi aarakshan ke liye 25 fisadi siten badhaane kaa prastaav he, kya vahaan kaa buniyadi dhaancha is laayak he ki vah is atirikt boj kaa vahan kar sake? ab tak lagbhag sari report bataati hai ki is desh ke zyaadaatar shikshan sansthaanon main maujuuda chaatro ko hi samuchit shiksha de paane ke intazaam nahin he
 Compared to the big universities abroad, the student-teacher ratio is very pathetic - ridiculous at some places
 sarkaar shikshakon kaa yah maujuuda kota hi nahin bhar paa rahi
 Not only this, the social quota that has to be taken care of in the appointment of teachers is also not being achieved by anyone
 to phir achaanak chah maheenon main 25 fisadi atirikt siton ke liye paise juta liye jane kaa jaadu phir kaise ghatit hoga? achaanak sarkaar kitni sari niyuktiyaan kar legi, kitne nae class room bana legi, kitne saare atirikt karmchaaree rakh legi? yahaan to alam yah he ki sarkari niyuktiyon ke liye routine main jo pad nikaale ja rahe hai, unhen bharne main barason lag ja rahe hai
 But then why does the government want to increase the seats by 25 percent? Why does she not want to give reservation to the existing students only? It argues that the existing quota should not be affected, but the Constitution Amendment Bill passed on the economic reservation, it is very clear that this reservation will be different from the existing social reservation
 zaahir he, sarkaar ko maujuuda cote kii fikr nahin, un agadon kii he, jinaki kuch siten tathakthith garib agade le udenge
 Of course, this hawkish, half-baked intervention of the government will leave the already battered and resource-poor government colleges and universities in a more uneasy state, where degrees may start to be distributed, but education will become a farce
 maamla sirf sarkari shikshan sansthaanon kaa nahin he
 Till now, the government has not bothered why reservation in private sector educational institutions - SC-ST or backward classes - is not obliged
 in tamaam nijee sansthaanon main kahin bhi aarakshan nahin he, lekin ab chunki yahaan 10 pratishat aarthik aarakshan kii vyavastha kaa kanoon banaaya ja chukaa he, isliye zaruri he ki yahaan bhi saamaajik aarakshan lagu ho
 For this, the government is talking of bringing the bill in the budget session
 use darasal saamaajik aarakshan kii nahin, aarthik aarakshan kii fikr he
 Because he knows that the fees of education in these private institutions are so high that people of most backward classes cannot afford it
 lekin phir aarthik aadhaar par kamazor log kaise karenge? sarkaar unhen aarakshan to dilaa degi, lekin kya unki fis bhi bharegi? yaa phir nijee sansthaanon se unki fis maafi kaa aagrah karegi? or kya nijee santhaan ise maanenge? shaikshik sansthaanon main aarakshan kaa faisalaa vaise bhi adalati mukademon main ulajhaa hua he
 So what does the government want after all? Will his botched efforts spoil things no more? And will the private sector educational institutions increase the seats, then they will also increase their appointments? Or will they appoint their teachers as before, on less money than the accepted criteria, and expel them whenever they want? In fact, the irony of higher education is very deep in India as well as the whole
 jis tarah praathmik shiksha main sarkaar apana nivesh badhaane ko taiyaar nahin he or nijee kshetra ke haath sab kuch saunp rahi he, vahi kaam ucch shiksha main bhi hota dikh rahaa he
 We are constantly moving towards a sick education system, in which on the one hand there are helpless government institutions and on the other hand private institutions deprived of concerns, which have converted education into shopkeeping
 shiksha kahin se sarkaar kii praathamikta suchi main nahin dikhti
 Education is just a way for her to try to woo different classes
 uske tazaa faisale shiksha kii in vidmbanaaon ko kuch or badhayenge hi, yah andeshaa bemaani nahin he

" padosiyon ke saath jhagade or manmutav iske raste main sabase badi rukaawat hai
 We should support any effort to eliminate these obstacles
 ’ He said, 'prime Minister Modi's sudden visit to Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is a commendable effort in every respect

 Due to good relations with neighbors, the atmosphere will be better and foreign investors will come forward to invest in India, but if the situation is not good then the investors will be stunned

 Regarding the growing trend of youth towards the dreaded terrorist organization ISIS, the religious leader said that this sequence is not right at all

 On the question of the Uttar Pradesh government not allowing All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi to hold a public meeting, Madani said he did not agree with Owaisi's tone and thinking
 ovaisi desh or musalamaanon ke liye bhi achche nahin hai, lekin rajya sarkaar se ek sawaal he ki ovaisi kii hi tarah bolne vaale anya netaaon par pabandi kyon nahin lagaayi gayi he

 The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved the judgment on the application of Justice Markandey Katju, former judge and former chairman of the Press Council
 justise katju ke khilaaf sansad ke donon sadanon ne ninda prastaav paarit kiya tha, jise nirast karwaane ke liye katju ne supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya he
 Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi in the court said during the hearing that Justice Katjuki's petition should be rejected, as both the houses of Parliament have only expressed their views on their views and not taken any punitive action
 atorni general ne yah bhi kaha kii adaalat agar aise maamle kii sunwaayee karegi to yah galat pratha hogi, kyonki sansad ke andar hui kaarywahi par adaalat main nyaayik samiksha nahin honi chahie
 Gandhi had told the British agent, Bose, to the Japanese
 Earlier on Wednesday, while hearing the Justice Markandey Katjuki petition, the Supreme Court had asked the Attorney General in the case to give his opinion in the case on Thursday
 purv jaj ne apane fasebuk post main aarope lagaaya tha ki sansad ke donon sadanon ne unhen apana paksh rakhane kaa avasar die bagaiyr hi 'gandhi ko british agent or subhash chandra bose ko japani agent' kehane sambandhi unke bayaan ke liye unki ninda kar di
 'will the citizens take action even on disagreement?' During the hearing, the Supreme Court had said, 'when a motion is passed in Parliament, it is the collective voice of the Members of Parliament
 to kya court is samuhik aawaaj par koi faisla suna saktaa he
 Has any fundamental right been violated by the passing of censure motion
 ' court ne ritred justise katju se poocha ki sansad sadasyon kii to chhodie, agar koi naagarik jise koi sangrakshan nahin he wo aapke kisi bayaan se asahmati jataata he, to kya iske badale aap us naagarik par karwai kar sakate hai?justise katju ne apni yachika ke saath fasebuk post bhi lagaaya he
 Katju has requested the petition to be quashed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on March 11 and 12 against him
 jahaan ek taraf pradhanmantri narendra modi sarkaar ke netritv main uttar pradesh main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko rokane ke liye samaajwaad party or bahujan samaaj party ne 25 saal kii takaraar ko kinare rakhane ke liye gathbandhan kiya he
 So on the same day, SP Patron Mulayam Singh Yadav said in a farewell speech on the last day of the 16th Lok Sabha that he wished PM Modi once again to become Prime Minister
 mulaayam singh yadav ke is bayaan ko jahaan bijepi ne apane sir maathe liya to vahiin samaajawaadee netaaon ke liye yah bayaan gale kii haddi kii tarah he jo na ugalate ban rahaa or na hi nigalate ban rahaa
 This is not the first time Mulayam Singh Yadav has created problems for the SP chief and his son Akhilesh Yadav with his statement
 samaajawaadee party main netritv ko lekar do saal pehle chali uthaa patake ke dauraan to netaji (mulaayam singh yadav) kai baar tatkaaleen mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav par sawalia nishaan khadey kar chuke hai
 Whether it is the talk of Akhilesh becoming the party president or the sp-congress alliance during the assembly elections, Mulayam has raised problems many times with his statements
 - isse pehle mulaayam singh yadav ne saal 2018 main kah diya tha ki ab na unki koi sunata he na unka sammaan karata he
 On this statement of Mulayam, the BJP took a dig at Akhilesh, while uncle Shivpal Yadav also attacked him
 - 1 janvari, 2018 ko lokbandhu rajanarayan kii punyatithi ke kaarykram ke dauraan mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki party main kuch log gutbaji ko badhaava de rahe hai, yah acchhee baat nahin he
 Mulayam's statement was taken as a gesture for his cousin Ram Gopal Yadav, due to which Shivpal Yadav was marginalized in the party
 - gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan samaajawaadee party ne apane 5 ummidavaar maidan main utaare the
 Then Mulayam Singh Yadav said that all the five candidates of the five will lose
 vahiin, uttar pradesh ke nikaay chunaav main apekshaakrit parinaam nahin aane par mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha ki yadi is chunaav kii jimmedaari shivpal yadav ko di jaati to nattejey behatar hote
 On the congress-sp alliance in the UP assembly elections, Mulayam Singh Yadav directly questioned the decision of the SP chief
 unhone kaha ki main gathbandhan ke paksh main nahin hum, agar ramgopal or akhilesh koi gathbandhan karte hai to mujhe koi or faisla lenaa padegaa
 - Mulayam Singh Yadav's pain comes out due to sp's defeat in UP assembly elections
 unhone kaha jo log booth haar gaye, akhilesh ne unhen bade-bade padon par baithaaya
 Those who have 50 votes in their house got only 9 votes from their family, how it happened will be seen
 - iske baad mulaayam singh yadav kii tis party adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke liye jaahir hui
 He is blessed when he says that Akhilesh is a son
 lekin unhone hamase kaha tha ki sirf teen maheene ke liye adhyaksh bana dijie, uske baad aap phir adhyaksh ho jaaiega
 But she does not stick to her tongue
 aisa vyakti kabhi kaamyaab nahin ho saktaa
 a big leader of the country said that which is not of the Father, it is not of anyone
 - iske alaava raashtrapati chunaav ke dauraan bhi mulaayam singh yadav ne endie ke ummidavaar ramnath kovind kaa samarthan kiya or kaha ki sapa endie ummidavaar kaa saath degi
 At an event in Mainpuri, Mulayam Singh Yadav said that it was his mistake to make Akhilesh the chief minister
 agar 2012 main ve khud mukhyamantri banate to 2017 kaa vidhansabha main sapa ko purna bahumat miltaa
 He said that there is no fault of the public in this because of its own party

 There is a noise over a statement from America in the politics of the country
 white house main pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan se mulaakaat main donald trump ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne unase kashmir par madhyasthata kaa anurodh kiya tha or vah iske liye taiyaar hai
 The opposition in India stalled parliament on Tuesday on Trump's statement
 sansad main lagaataar maang hoti rahi ki pradhanmantri modi ko jawaab dena chahie
 UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi said PM Modi should give a statement
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki modi ne bhartiya hiton se dhokhaa kiya
 Whereas Akhilesh Yadav said that Modi should give a record of the entire conversation
 manish tiwari ne kaha ki yah bharat kii ekta, bharat kii akhandta or bharat kii samprabhutaa ke upar bahut bada aghat he
 Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said that the Indian government has bowed its head in front of the American President
 hamaara desh bahut taqatvar he, vah kisi ke saamne nahin jhuk saktaa
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi come to the House and reply
 videsh mantri es
 Jaishankar made a statement in the House but the opposition parties kept demanding a statement from PM Modi
 videsh mantralay ne pehle hi bayaan jari kar saaf kar diya tha ki pradhanmantri modi ne america raashtrapati trump se is tarah kaa anurodh nahin kiya tha
 Foreign Minister S
 in Parliament
 jaishankar ne bhi yahi baat doharaai
 But PM Modi, who met Trump as a friend on international forums, has not given any explanation about this
 galgotiya uniwarsity main raajnneeti vigyaan vibhaag ke pramukh shrish pathak piem modi kii chuppi ko kootnithik or uchit maanate hai
 He told that the most prominent face of American foreign policy is the President of there
 bharat-america sambandhon kii mahatta dekhte hue trump ke bayaan kii spasht aalochana na sambhav he or na hi aavashyak he
 At the moment a diplomatic silence has more benefits
 shrish pathak ne kaha, 'aisa lagata he ki bhartiya videsh vibhaag ne koi pahal jarur kii ho is aashaa se ki samaadhaan bhartiya paksh main adhikadhik sambhav ho sake
 But the matter is not built and Trump has made a statement outlining his role so that Trump's supporters like it
 gauratlab he ki agle varsh america main chunaav bhi he
 Any rebuttal by Modi will eventually bring a sourness in the relationship and India would not like this
 'shrish pathak kaa kahana he ki yah bhi sambhav he ki ek doorgaami samaj ban gai ho or trump ne jisaki ore ek ishaara kar diya ho
 It is only in the womb of time that how things unfold
 itnaa jarur kaha ja saktaa he ki kashmir ek mudde ke taur par aane vaale dinon main pramukhataa se antarrashtriya aakarshan ban phir ubharegaa
 Why India does not want a mediator Actually, the reason for the controversy over Trump's statement is the Simla Agreement signed between India and Pakistan in 1972
 bharat hameshaa kahata rahaa he ki yadi koi teesraa paksh kashmir mudde ko sulajhane main madhyasthata karata he to yah shimla samjhaute kaa ulanghan hoga
 On July 2, 1972, an agreement was reached between then Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi and President of Pakistan Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in Shimla
 ise shimla samjhauta ke naam se janaa jaataa he or isamen jammu-kashmir se jude do ahm muddon par bhi donon deshon ke bich sahmati bani thi
 The first thing was that whatever dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, both the countries will settle peacefully themselves
 iske liye kisi tisare desh ke dakhal kii jarurat nahin he
 According to the annual report of the US Commission for International Religion Freedom (USCIRF), 'in 2015, tolerance in India was hurt and incidents of religious freedom violations increased

 The Commission says that in view of analyzing the situation, it will also monitor the events in 2016
 USCIRF ne america sarkaar ko bharat ke saath dharmik swatantraaa or nitiyon ke mudde par dwipaksheeya baatcheet karne kii salaah di he
 Interestingly, this report came almost a month before PM Modi's visit to Washington
 kamishan kii report ke mutabik, 'saal 2015 main alpsankhyak samudaayon, khaas taur par isaayiyon, musalamaanon or sikhon ko bhay, utpeedan or hinsa kaa shikaar hona padaa
 Hindu nationalist organizations were largely responsible for their persecution
 police ke pakshpaat or nyaayik khaamiyon kii vajah se alpsankhyak samudaay khud ko asurakshit mahasoos karne laga he
 Earlier, the Indian government refused to grant visas to USCIRF members
 ateet main upie sarkaar ne bhi kamishan ke sadasyon ko vija nahin diya tha
 Another interesting thing is that Katrina Lantos, commissioner of USCIRF, had come to Dharamshala from China to attend a meeting on differences
 USCIRF yues fedral governments kamishan kaa dwidaleey or swatantra nikaay he
 It is the only body in the world which is committed to protecting the religious freedom of the people all over the world
 bharat sarkaar ne 27 november, 2014 se i-paryatak vija suvidha shuru kii thi

 We made a mistake in reading the pitch, but as the Indian captain Dhoni himself said that he too could not read this pitch correctly and this pitch looked good and we cannot do much about what is not in our hands

 pehle match main kiwi team ke khilaaf is tarah kii pich haar kii vajah bani to is baar team india ne pakistan kii chook kaa faaydaa uthaaya
 The question is why such a pitch is seen in India's matches
 baaki maichon main bade score ban rahe hai or unka safaltaapurvak peechha bhi ho rahaa he
 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni also expressed surprise at the behavior of the pitch
 "initially i did not think that the wicket would take such a turn
" pich ko padhane ke baad mujhe laga ki pich main thodi nami hogi kyonki match se ek din pehle pich ko pani diya gaya tha or phir pich ko zyada dhoop nahin mili
 When i saw the pitch for the last time before the match, i felt that there is a lot of moisture in the pitch and if you roll the pitch, the upper surface can look good but the moisture is retained from inside and that is why the spinners are so got help

 -input bhashaa In our country, drinking tea is a habit
 baat ke dauraan agar chaay kii chuskiyaan na lee jaaen to kuch adhuraa lagata he
 About 80 to 90 percent of the country's population likes to drink tea in the morning
 bed tii kaa culture na keval shaharon main prachlit he balki gaanv-dehaat main bhi log subah kii shuruyaat chaay se karnaa pasand karte hai
 But what do you think, is it a good and healthy habit? Drinking some empty stomach tea is a very bad habit, especially in summer, according to some recent studies
 chaay main kuch maatra main caffeine hoti he or saath hi isamen el-thynin, theophilin bhi hota he jo uttejit karne kaa kaam karte hai
 Yes, if you want, you can wake up in the morning and have some light tea and have tea
 iske alaava agar aap bahut adhik chaay pite hai to bhi aapkosavdhaan ho jane kii jarurat he
 This can cause damage to the internal surface of the stomach
 kuch logon ko blike tii pinaa pasand hota he
 They do not like to drink milk with tea
 par shaayad unhen pataa nahin hota ki swasthya ke lihaaj ye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, the sugar present in the tea can also make you fat
 subah uthakar khaali pet chaay pine ke nuksaan:1
 By drinking tea on an empty stomach in the morning, the process of bile juice becomes irregular
 jiske chalate aapako michali aa sakati he or ghabrahat mahasoos ho sakati he
 2
 aamtaur par blike tii ko sehatmand mana jaataa he lekin bahut adhik blike tii pinaa sehat ke liye nuksaandeh ho saktaa he
 It is generally believed that drinking black tea reduces weight, but drinking black tea causes flatulence and no appetite
 3
 People usually like to drink milk tea
 par kam hi logon ko pataa hoga ki khaali pet doodh vaali chaay pine se jaldi thakaan mahasoos hoti he
 Also, irritability also comes in practice
 4
 If you are also one of those people who like drinking strong tea, then please be careful
 zyada strang chaay pine waalon ko ulcer hone kaa khatra rahata he
 This increases the risk of wounding in the inner surface of the stomach
 5
 Many people make more tea once and keep it warm and drink again and again
 baar-baar garm karke chaay pinaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he

 (link in bio)a post shared by Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) on Jul 27, 2017 at 5:01am PDT Why did Mahendra Singh Dhoni, known as Captain Cool for years, get angry in Bangladesh? Nobody could believe that he was the same Dhoni who was known for his cool mind
 'captain kool' se 'dhakkebaaz dhoni' hue msdjo hona tha wo to ho chukaa captain kool se dhoni ab dhakkebaaz dhoni ho gaye hai or badale main apni match fees kaa 75 fisadi bhi gavaan chuke hai
 But after all, why did such a situation come, why did Captain Cool get angry? Actually, if we look at the score card of Dhoni's last few matches, then it becomes clear that the captain's bat is angry with him
 tabhi to pichley saat saalon se barf kii tarah thande dimag se captaini pari khel rahe dhoni kaa kaa khun mustafijur rahamaan par khul gaya or unhone use dhakka de diya
 If statistics are to be believed, Dhoni's poor form is also responsible for retiring from Test cricket
 kya dhoni ko yaad he apni aakhri match jitau pari?dhoni ne van-de main aakhri yaadgaar pari world cap kii shuruyaat main zimbabwe ke khilaaf kheli thi jab unhone 85 ranon kii noteout pari khelkar raina ke saath milakar team india ko jeet dilaai thi
 In the World Cup itself, Dhoni won the team by playing an innings of 45 runs against the West Indies
 in donon pariyon ke alaava dhoni ko koi match jitau pari khele hue bahut din ho gaye hai, van-de cricket ke best finishars main se ek dhoni ke liye yah kitni takalif kii baat he ye unase behatar koi nahin jaan saktaa
 Dhoni did not even run in IPL, even in IPL, Dhoni managed only 372 runs in 17 innings in which his best score was 53 runs
 itane bade kad ke khilaadi ke liye yah chintaa ke saath hi khud par gussa karne kaa vishay bhi ho saktaa he
 And this was Dhoni's anger on Thursday when he pushed debutant fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from Bangladesh
 madhyapradesh main kisaan karjamaafee yojana kii suchi main purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke bhai or anya parijanon ke naam aane ke maamle ne tool pakad liya he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Chief Minister Kamal Nath waved a copy of Chauhan's brother's application at a rally and claimed to have their debts forgiven
 chouhan jahaan apane bhai dwaara karjamaafee kaa aavedan na kiye jane kaa daawa kar rahe hai, vahiin unke bhai rohit singh chouhan ne aavedan ko hi farji qaraar de diya
 Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday claimed to be the name of Shivraj Singh Chauhan's brother Rohit and uncle's son in the debt waiver list in Gwalior
 saath hi chouhan par jhooth bolne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Chauhan came to reporters on Thursday to answer Rahul Gandhi's charge and said that his brother Rohit Singh had not even applied for loan waiver, yet the loan was waived, it is a conspiracy
 mukhyamantri kamalnath bataaen ki unke (chouhan) parivaar par itani meharbaani kyon? chouhan ne sarkari kagajaat ko dikhaate hue kaha, inamen saaf likhaa he ki rohit ne karjamaafee ke liye aavedan nahin kiya he, saath hi ve ykardaata hai
 Chauhan accused the Congress that in the promissory note that the loan of farmers up to two lakh rupees was waived, now the Congress has reneged on its promise and is only talking about crop loan waiver
 chouhan ke bayaan par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or mukhyamantri kamalnath ne palatwaar kiya
 The two leaders publicly waved a copy of the loan waiver application of Chauhan's brother Rohit Singh Chauhan and uncle's boy in a public meeting in Bina of Sagar parliamentary constituency
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tarah madhyapradesh ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan bhi jhooth bolne kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 The Congress government in the state has waived off farmers' debt, this is true
 shivaraj ke parijanon kaa bhi karj maaf hua he
 Showing the application of Shivraj's family, Rahul said, "these are the applications of his family, which have his names
" karj unka maaf hua or aapke purv mukhyamantri kehete hai ki karj maaf nahin hua
 Now stop lying to Shivraj Singh Chauhan "
 unhone aage kaha, "jab congress ne madhyapradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main kisaanon kaa karj maaf karne kaa vaada kiya tha, tab kaha ja rahaa tha ki iske liye paisa kahaan se aayega
 Chauhan will be sent copies of his family's loan waiver application "
 chouhan or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi va kamalnath ke daavon ke bich rohit singh chouhan saamne aae or kaha, "meri ore se karjamaafee kaa koi aavedan nahin kiya gaya he, ykardaata hum
 The applications that are being told are fake "congress leader led by senior Congress leader Suresh Pachauri reached the residence of former Chief Minister Chauhan with a list of 21 lakh farmers
 is suchi main un kisaanon ke naam darj hai, jinka karj maaf ho chukaa he
 In this list, the name of Chauhan's brother and family has been claimed by the government
 maaloom ho ki rajya sarkaar ne kisaan karjamaafee ke liye teen rang ke alag-alag aavedan kisaanon se maange the
 The farmers had submitted their applications to the panchayats
 usee ke aadhaar par sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki rajya main 55 lakh kisaanon par karj he
 Out of these, loans up to two lakh rupees of 21 lakh farmers have been waived
 loksabhaa chunaav kii adarsh aachaar samhita lagu hone ke kaaran karjamaafee kii prakriya rukii he
 The debt of the remaining farmers will be forgiven as soon as elections are held mahaan ballebaaj rahul dravid ne team india ke coach banane kii chahat jataai he
 He said this after giving the Dilip Sardesai Memorial Lecture
 unhone chaking or ekadivasiy cricket ke mudde par bhi apane vichaar rakhe
 When Rahul Dravid was asked about coaching Team India, he said, 'I think everything is the right time
 maine camentator ke taur par apni bhoomika kaa lutf uthaaya
 Also playing the role of mentor of Rajasthan Royals was enjoyable
 bhavishya kii baat karen to main team india hi kyon, ranjai trophy main rajasthan team kaa coach bananaa chaahunga
 On the occasion of odis in difficulty, Rahul Dravid said that ODI cricket is currently the most irrelevant among the three formats of the game and is struggling to preserve its existence
 unhone kaha ki ise praasangik banaae jane ke liye champions trophy yaa vishwa cap jaise adhik toornamenton kaa aayojan karnaa hoga
 Dravid said, 'I think ODI cricket is struggling
 ekadivasiy cricket ko agar aap champions trophy yaa vishwa cap ke najariye se dekho to yah praasangik he
 He said, 'I think all other ODI cricket should be played in such a way that it progresses to play in the Champions Trophy and World Cup
 mujhe lagata he ki bemaani vanade match ho rahe hai or kaaphi adhik vanade match samasya ho sakate hai
 Regarding illegal bowling action, Dravid said that 'chucking' is not a crime but technical flaws should be rectified
 dravid ne kaha, ‘isisi kaa niyam he
 When he reviewed the old footage, he found that it is normal for the elbow to turn 15 degrees
 sabhi aisa kar rahe hai
 Glenn mcgrath's elbow also turned but it was within 15 degrees so he did not chuck
 iske liye ek pranali he
 'he said,' i am happy that they are strictly implementing it and reviewing it

 punjab ke purv mukhyamantri or varisht congress netaa captain amarinder singh ne aakhir kyon mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ke khilaaf chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai? achaanak kyon congress ne punjab main apni ranneeti badali he?yahaan aam aadmi party ke pramukh arvind kejariwal ke aaropon kaa zikr karnaa dilachasp hoga
 Kejriwal has been arguing that there is a strategic understanding between the Congress and the Akali Dal and both have been helping each other in the past
 kejariwal ne apane taaja twit main ye aarope lagaaya he ki captain ko chunaav abhiyaan kaa kharch bikramjit singh majithia se mil rahaa he, jo captain ke rishtedaar bhi hai
 Kejriwal also alleged that Kikaptan saved Majithia from the CBI probe three years ago
 kejariwal ne twit main captain se poocha he- 'sar, badalon ne kuch maheene pehle aapke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamle band kar die the
 Why? Punjab wants to know what was the deal
 ' kejariwal ne ye daawa bhi kiya he kiakaali dal or congressek duusare ko phayda pahunchane ke liye chunaav lard rahe hai
 However, Captain Amarinder Singh has dismissed Kejriwal's allegations
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki kejariwal ke aaropon kii vajah se hi captain ne prakaash singh badal ke khilaaf chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya
 Actually, the Congress wants to air the allegations of the Aam Aadmi Party, so it is decided to pit the Captain against Badal
 badal ke khilaaf khadaa hone se captain kii ummidavaari ko bal milegaa
 This is the first time when Prakash Singh Badal is being challenged by Amarinderki in his stronghold
 is faisle se aam aadmi party ke aaropon kii jahaan majboot kaat ho sakegi vahiin amarinder pehle se bhi zyada majboot congress netaa ke taur par ubharenge
 However, this is not the first time that the Captain has fielded against a veteran leader

 It was defeated by 65 lakh votes
 captain lambii vidhansabha seat se prakaash singh badal ko chunauti dene ja rahe hai jo senior badal kii paaramparik seat rahi he
 The Captain said on Sunday, i will tell the elderly person (prakash Singh Badal) what politics is
 main ek yoddha hum or haarana pasand nahin karata
 i will contest from Long and Patiala
 badal sirf akele rajaneta nahin hai jinhen captain ne chunauti di he
 The Captain had also invited AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal to do two or two hands directly in the elections, but the captain himself withdrew
 kejariwal ne twit-yuddh main captain ko kaayar tak qaraar de daalaa
 Kejriwal said that it would be a cowardly step if the captains contest from two places
 kejariwal ne kaha ki captain ko sirf lambii seat se ladanaa chahie, naa ki patiala jaisi surakshit seat se
 Targeting Amarinder, Kejriwal tweeted another, "sir, are you contesting from two seats or only from a long seat
" log aapako kaayar kahenge agar aapane donon siton se chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya
 According to sources, the Congress wants to play the stakes of the veteran candidate against the veterans, changing their strategy in Punjab
