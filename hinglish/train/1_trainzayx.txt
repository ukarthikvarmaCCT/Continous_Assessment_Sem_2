 Senior off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has described the current Australian team led by Steve Smith as the weakest team to have visited India recently
 bharat ko 23 farvari se pune main shuru ho rahi chaar test maichon kii shrinkhalaa main prabal daavedaar mana ja rahaa he
 Harbhajan said that i have played against some of Australia's finest teams
 meraa maananaa he ki yah bharat kaa daura karne vaali sabase kamjor australian team he
 i do not think that this team will be able to face this great team of India under Indian conditions
 bharat 2013 kii tarah shrinkhalaa 4-0 se jeet saktaa he
 Harbhajan, who took 32 wickets in the 2001 series against Australia, said that team had players like Matthew Hayden, Michael Slater, Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh
 is team main steve smith or david warner ko chhodkar koi bhi ballebaaj aar aswin or ravindra jadeja kaa saamana nahin kar sakegaa
 a better batsman told England team Australia scored 469 runs in the practice match against India but there is no player from the Test team in the hosts
 harbhajan ne kaha ki pichley dinon bharat kaa daura karne vaali england team behatar ballebaaji team thi
 He scored over 400 runs on several occasions
 harbhajan ne kaha ki ipel ko hataa dijie kyonki ve match sapaat ballebaaji pichon par khele jate hai
 Smith has scored most centuries against Australian pitchers
 vahaan viketon main itnaa turn nahin hota or oochaal se strokes khilne main madad milti he
 Playing Ashwin and Jadeja in India will be a big challenge for Smith
 warner aakraamak khelte hai or out hone ke maukey bhi adhik dete hai
 He also ruled out that Mitchell Starc would be a big challenge for India
 unhone kaha ki yah shrinkhalaa garmiyon main shuru ho rahi he
 It would be difficult for Stark to put three four overs in such heat and humidity
 vaise bhi stark ek pari main kitne over daalenge
 Regarding Nathan Lyon, Harbhajan said that i respect him very much
 usne 200 se adhik test wicket liye hai or zyaadatarcricket australiamein liye hai
 But he has to bowl to batsmen like Virat Kohli, Murali Vijay and Ajinkya Rahane in India
 warner ke bare main unhone kaha ki warner aise khilaadi nahin hai jo ek satr main 35 ran banaaenge
 75 if he is at the crease
 80 ran jarur banaaenge
 If Ashwin and Jadeja bowl economically, then they can put pressure on them

 The World Cup is on the head and Team India is losing, but despite the defeat, there is a department that captain Dhoni is not too worried about
 test ke mukaable vanade main gendbaazon ne behatar pradarshan kiya he, stfort binni ne 3 vanade main 4
 Bowled at an economy rate of 46 and took 4 wickets
 mohit sharma ne 1 match khelaa, sirf 3
 Gave 60 runs per over and named 2 victims
 test main mahange sabit hue shami ne bhi 4 vanade main 4
 Bowled with an economy of 62 and took 2 wickets
 akshar patel ne bhi 4 vanade maichon main 4
 Won a wicket with an economy of 21, taking 2 wickets
 haalanki bhavaneshwar kumaar ne 5
 23 runs per over and were able to take just 1 wicket
 dhoni ne apane paas maujuud har ek gendbaaz ko aazamaa kar apana ection plan bhi taiyaar kar liya he
 On the bowling front, what Dhoni's strategy will be on the Australian wickets is clear in his mind
 dhoni kehete hai, 'ham teen tej gendbaaz or do spinner ke saath nahin khel sakate, isse hamaari ballebaazi bahut kamazor ho jaati he, agar do wicket jaldi gir jaae to baaki ke ballebaazon par bahut dabaav aa jaataa he
 ' yani team india do tej gendbaaz, do spinner or ek olerounder ke saath hi maidan par utregi
 However, the choice of who will be the two fast bowlers will not be easy
 akshar or aswin main to philhal akshar baazi maarthe nazar aa rahe hai, kyonki vah balle se bhi upyogi sabit ho sakate hai
 Dhoni said, 'we have to strengthen our batting
 puchhallon kaa ballebaazi karnaa bahut zaruri he
 The last 4-5 players cannot be dismissed quickly
 ' Dhoni's idea of strengthening batting also suits Team India, but there is a truth that even this formula could not succeed in the TRAI series
 janansakhya visphot kii kagaar par pahunch chuki bharat kii jansankhya pichley 100 varshon main paanch guna badi he or varsh 2050 tak vah china ko bhi peeche chhod degi
 According to government estimates, India's population rate has been around 1 for the last five years
 4 pratishat kii dar se bad rahi he
 While the population growth rate in China during the same period is 0
 6 pratishat rahi
 The total population of India in the year 2009 is around 119
 8 crores, china kii 134
 5 crores and Pakistan's 18 crores
 jabaki varsh 2050 tak bharat kii jansankhya 161
 38 crores and only 141 of China
 7 karod rahegi
 In this way India will overtake China in terms of population
 is sambandh main mjedaar baat yah he ki bhartiya upmahadweep main pakistan kii jansankhya dar pichley paanch vashare main sabase adhik 2
 Grew at a 2 percent rate
 varsh 2026 tak bharat kii jansankhya par 37
 The additional burden of 1 crore people will increase
 is jansankhya main uttar pradesh kaa hissaa 22 pratishat, bihar kaa aath, uttarakhand ek pratishat, or chaar dakshin bhartiya rajyon main 13 pratishat tathaa madhya pradesh evam rajasthan main prayek kaa saat saat fisad hissaa rahegaa
 The 'population Stability Fund' report of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare says that if the population continues to grow at the same pace in India, the population will double in the next 50 years
 is report main ek or mjedaar baat kahi gai he ki bharat main kai aise rajya honge jinaki akeli jansankhya kai anya deshon kii kul jansankhya ke baraabar hogi
 For example, population 18 in Uttar Pradesh
 3 karod he jo brazil kii kul jansankhya 18
 Is very close to 7 crores
 isi tarah maharashtra ke 10
 Mexico's 10 million population
 4 karod kii jansankhya ke baraabar he
 In terms of Bihar population (nine crore) Germany (8
 3) se bhi aage he
 The report said that in the field of family planning in India, Chandigarh has reached 74 percent, while Jharkhand has reached 68 percent
 ghotaale ke sizan main nae ghotaale kaa pardaafash hua he
 This is the biggest land scam till date, which has been termed as mini 2-G scam by Bombay High Court
 iske taar puure maharashtra or khaas taur par pune main saamne aae he
 This scam took place under the Urban Land Ceiling ie ULC Act 1976
 bombai hoicourt ne maamle ko behad gambhir maanate hue ise ab tak kaa sabase bada ghotaalaa bataaya he
 It has played with millions of square feet of land
 khaas baat ye he ki is zamin kaa phayda samaaj ke garib tabakon ko milanaa chahie tha
 The court wants to hand over the investigation of the case to the CBI
 kyonki aarope he ki bogus kaagazaat ke aadhaar par bilderon−netaaon or bade sarkari baabuon ne zamin ko apane kabze main banaaye rakhaa
 Under the ULC Act, there was a provision that the government would acquire more than 500 square meters of land in urban areas, but it is said that the compensation would be less than the government takeover, so the papers were prepared so that there was no need to surrender the land
 maamle main arji daalane vaale hai bijepi ke pravaktaa madhav bhandari
 It has been alleged in the application that there are a lot of such cases in Pune alone, so in the next hearing on February 10, the CBI and ACB Officer Incharge have been asked to be present in the court
 aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke muddenjar bihar main raajnneetik sargharmiyaan tej hone lagi hai
 On the one hand, in the context of national politics, the path of the grand alliance is being discovered in front of the BJP, while in Bihar, there are also marches being played among the regional parties
 endie ke ghatak dalon main bikharaav kii atakalon ke bich ravivaar ko jab rashtriya lok samta party ne iftaar party kaa aayojan kiya to usamen unke sahyogi dal ke netaa hi nahin pahunche
 In fact, the Iftar party organized by Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) was organized on Sunday amid speculation of discontent among NDA constituents in Bihar
 nimantran ke baavjood mukhyamantri nitish kumaar, upmukhyamantri va bhaajapa netaa susheel kumaar modi or lojpa se koi bhi netaa iftaar main shaamil nahin hue
 After the incident, RJD leader Tejaswi Prasad Yadav called RLSP chief and Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha to leave the NDA and join his party-led coalition as he has been 'ignored' in the NDA for the last four years
 haalanki, kushvaha ne tejasvi kaa yah nimantran thukraa diya or is baat par jor diya ki vah endie main hai or narendra modi ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main phir se pradhanmantri banane ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, the interesting thing is that the RLSP had invited all the constituents of NDA to the Iftar party, despite this no big leader reached except the two leaders of BJP
 ralospa ke pravaktaa abhayanand suman ne bataaya ki iftaar party kaa nimantran bihar main endie ke sabhi ghatak dalon jadyu, bhaajapa or lojpa ko unke karyaalayon main bheja gaya tha
 Actually, JDU and LJP leaders are going to make huge sense in Kushwaha's iftar party
 ab tak ye charchaa he ki bijepi se naakhush jadyu,ralospa or lojpasath milakar bihar main chunaav lard sakate hai
 On the other hand, BJP leaders of the state have also placed a demand to contest elections on their own in 2019
 aise main ralospa kii iftaar party main nitish kumaar or ram vilaas paswan kaa na pahunchnaa kya raajnneetik rukh letaa he, ye to vakt hi batayega

 In this, their phone number, email ID and six digit code will have to be given

 2 days ago, Congress released the first list of its candidates for the Lok Sabha elections, after which the Samajwadi Party (SP) announced the names of its nine candidates on Friday
 party sansthaapak mulaayam singh yadav or dimple yadav ke naam aane ke baad kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki akhilesh yadav azamgarh seat se chunaav lard sakate hai
 The Azamgarh parliamentary seat is a Yadav and Muslim dominated area and was won by the former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections amid Modi wave
 mulaayam ne tab 2 seat se chunaav (azamgarh or mainpuri) main jeet hasil kii thi, lekin unhone azamgarh ko apana sansadeey kshetra barkaraar rakhaa
 However, this time Mulayam Singh Yadav had already announced to quit Azamgarh seat and expressed his desire to contest from Mainpuri
 mulaayam kii ichha ke anusaar party ne unhen mainpuri se tikat diya jabaki akhilesh yadav kii patni dimple yadav kannauj se chunaav ladane ja rahi hai
 In such a situation, it has intensified that former Chief Minister and party chief Akhilesh can contest Lok Sabha elections from Azamgarh

 It is going to be beneficial that if Akhilesh Yadav contests from eastern Uttar Pradesh to give a tough fight to the BJP, then his coming can also benefit the Samajwadi Party in many neighboring seats and this is the main reason why Akhilesh You can contest from Azamgarh
 azamgarh main yadav, musalmaan or dalit kii aabaadi zyada he or basapa ke saath gathbandhan ke baad samaajawaadee party ke liye is seat se raah aasaan dikh rahi he
 SP released its candidates list on 2 occasions on Friday

 According to this list, Mulayam Singh Yadav will contest from Mainpuri
 jabaki dharmendra yadav badaayun se or samaajawaadee party ke pramukh mahasachiv ram gopal yadav ke bete akshay yadav firozabad se apni kismat aajamaayenge
 On the other hand, Etawah (reserved seat) Kamlesh Katheria, Robertsganj (safe seat) Bhailal Cole and Bahraich (safe seat) Shabbir Valmiki have been given tickets
 firozabad se party ke baagi shivpal singh yadav bhi chunaav ladenge
 Apart from Dimple Yadav's Kannauj in the second list released by the evening party, Dr
 purvi verma ko khiri or usha verma ko hardoi (surakshit loksabhaa seat) se tikat diya gaya

 sinha ne kaha ki isiilie unhen ‘rashtriya vyaktitv’ ghoshit kiya jaae
 He had so much to say that there was a laughter in the house and Lalu ji was seen smiling dimly

 saunva antarrashtriya shatak jadne ke baad kaaphi raahat mahasoos kar rahe sachin tendulkar ne kaha ki is uplabdhi ke chaaron ore jo hip bani hui thi, usase nipatna ‘maansik rup se kaaphi kathin’ tha or mazaakia lahaze main kaha ki ise hasil karne ke baad unka 50 kigra vajan kam ho gaya
 When asked how he felt after achieving this feat, as it would probably never be achieved, he said jokingly, "I can't believe it yet, but definitely My 50 kg weight has reduced
 ’’ tendulkar ne kaha, ‘‘nishchit rup se main is samay kuch nahin soch saktaa
 It has been a difficult period for me
 vishesh rup se kathin rahaa he, kyonki main australia main thik-thaak pradarshan kar rahaa tha, lekin kabhi-kabhaar laga ki bhagya mere saath nahin tha
 "he said," How many hundreds you make, it doesn't matter because you always play for your team
 ’’tippaniyan Tendulkar said, "I was not thinking about this achievement, the media started it, wherever i went, restaurants, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th century
" yah maansik rup se mere liye kaaphi mushkil ho gaya tha, kyonki koi bhi mere 99wein shatak ke bare main nahin baat kar rahaa tha
 '' shuukravaar kii pari, shaayad unki sabase dhimi ekadivasiy pari, ke bare main baat karte hue tendulkar ne kaha ki ran bananaa kathin tha
 "it was difficult to score, because the ball was not coming on the bat," he said
 ’’ yah poochne par ki vah is samay apane yuva prashansakon ko kya kahana chahenge, to tendulkar ne kaha, ‘‘khel kaa lutf uthaao or apane sapane ko saakaar karo
 i have waited 22 years for the World Cup
 isliye apane sapane ko sach karo
 '' unase jab poocha gaya ki yah uplabdhi hasil karne ke baad kaisaa mahasoos ho rahaa he, kyonki ise shaayad kabhi hasil hi nahin kiya ja sakegaa, to unhone mazaakia lahaze main kaha, ‘‘mujhe abhi tak vishwaas nahin ho rahaa he, lekin nishchit rup se meraa 50 kigra bhaar kam ho gaya he
 "tendulkar said," Certainly i cannot think of anything at this time
 yah mere liye kathin daur rahaa he
 It has been especially difficult, as i was doing well in Australia, but at times i felt that luck was not with me
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘aap kitne saikade jadte ho, yah myne nahin rakhata kyonki aap hameshaa apni team ke liye khelte ho
 '' Comments tendulkar ne kaha, ‘‘main is uplabdhi ke bare main nahin soch rahaa tha, media ne yah shuru kiya tha, main jahaan bhi jaataa, restaraan, room sarvice, har koi 100wein shatak ke bare main baat kar rahaa tha
 It had become quite difficult for me mentally, because no one was talking about my 99th century
 ’’ Talking about Friday's innings, perhaps his slowest one-day innings, Tendulkar said it was difficult to score runs
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ran bananaa mushkil tha, kyonki gend balle par nahin aa rahi thi
 Asked what he would like to say to his young fans at the moment, Tendulkar said, "enjoy the game and make your dream come true
" maine vishwa cap ke liye 22 saal intjaar kiya he
 So make your dream come true
 ’’ Tendulkar said, "I was not thinking about this achievement, the media started it, wherever i went, restaurants, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th century

 manoj vaajapeyi (manoj Bajpai) ne shuukravaar ko ek kaarykram main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘pulavama main jo kuch bhi hua, vah bahud dukhad he
 My prayers are with the families of the soldiers who lost their beloved people
 unhone jo khoyaa he, uski bharpai nahin ho sakati he
 "manoj Bajpai said," We will have less words to express our anger at this heinous incident
 jahaan tak logon ke gusse kii baat he to main yah kah saktaa hum sarkaar sahi faisla legi or hamen sarkaar main vishwaas rakhana chahie or in paristhitiyon main uski madad kerani chahie

 The Ramjanmabhoomi Babri Masjid dispute was heard in the country's highest court for two and a half hours
 haalanki adaalat se baahar chaahe is maamle se jude pakshakaar hon yaa aam naagarik sabhi yahi kahata he ki is maamle ko siyasat se dur rakhana chahie
 It is a matter of ownership over the land, plain and simple
 lihaaja ek to ye divaani he or doosraa jajbaati maamla bhi
 In such a situation, politics is better than this
 lekin court main jo kuch hua wo isse koson dur hi dikhaa
 When a three-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court sat for a hearing in this case, it seemed that the hearing would be on legal grounds
 lekin congress ke netaa or varisht vakil kapil sibbal or unke saathi vakil dow
 Rajiv Dhawan gave most of the arguments politically
 kabhi endie ke chunavi ghoshnaa patr main ramamandir kaa zikr to kabhi sunwaayee ko aane vaale loksabhaa chunaav tak yani july 2019 tak taalane kii daleelein de daaleen
 Shia Waqf Board said- We have extracted the formula
 When the Supreme Court hearing started, advocate MC Dhingra on behalf of Shia Waqf Board made clear its stand
 unhone kaha ki shiya vakf board ne apni taraf se is masale ko adaalat ke jariye yaa baahar hal karne kaa formula nikaala he
 Its blueprint is that a Ram temple be built on the birthplace and a mosque in Lucknow or Faizabad should be built
 lekin court ne ye kahkar daleel ko tool nahin diya ki ye baaten to baad main hongi pehle sunwaayee kii ruparekha to tay ho jaae
 After this, one of the main three parties and the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board counsel Kapil Sibal came to the Supreme Court to challenge the Allahabad High Court's decision in this case
 sibbal ne pehle to anuwaad kiye dastavej ko upi sarkaar kii ore se na die jane kii daleel di
 After this, he came directly to the political issue
 unka saaf saaf kahana tha ki adaalat is maamle kii sunwaayee july 2019 tak ke liye taal de
 That is, the court should keep the hearing in this case till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are held
 court ne kaha ki aakhir aam chunaav se is mukademe kaa kya sambandh he
 On this, Sibal argued that the hearing is going on in this court room, but it will affect the country
 chif justise ne kaha ki aisa kuch nahin hota he
 This is also a lawsuit
 tathy or sabooton ke aadhaar par isaki bhi sunwaayee honi he
 But Sibal again said that if anyone feels anything, i believe that the effect will be there
 kyonki modi sarkaar ke chunavi ghoshnaa patr main bhi ram mandir banane kaa zikr he
 The Ram temple is included in the government's political agenda
 agar is maamle main jaisaa bhi faisla aayega ye sarkaar uskaa raajnneetik istemaal karegi
 So somehow it should be avoided
 lekin court nesibbalki is daleel ko bhi nazarandaaj kar diya
 Sibal's fellow lawyer Drs
 rajeev dhawan ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki 19 hajaar pej se zyada ke dastavej hai
 There are three main parties
 20 se zyada intervinar hai
 From now onwards, every week from Monday to Friday, even if you hear eight hours daily, the hearing will not be completed before October next year
 yani unhone kaha ki chif justise deepak mishra ke kaarykaal main is maamle kaa faisla naammumkin he
 The court also blew his style in the air
 aakhri daleel di gai ki ek constitution bench jisamen paanch yaa saat jaj hon usee bench ko ye maamla sunanaa chahie
 Because a few years ago a Constitution Bench had ruled in a lawsuit that the mosque was not an integral part of Islam
 to ab teen jajon kii bench waisi hi masjid ke malikana haq kaa faisla kaise karegi
 The court also did not give priority to this argument by saying that it is a matter of civil suit and not an issue related to constitution
 ab baichaiyn hone kii baari yachikakartaon ke vakeelon kii thi
 Sibal and Rajiv Dhawan broke out as soon as the court asked them to present the fact sheet i
e
 the facts before the court while proceeding further
 unka kahana tha ki hamaari kanoonee aapattiyon or sujhaavon ke baavjood agar adaalat sunwaayee karegi to wo virodh karenge
 The court nevertheless adopted an apathetic attitude
 is par bifere donon vakeelon ne adaalat ke kamare se baahar jane tak kii baat kah daali
 On this, the court discussed the list of documents that formed the basis of the arguments
 karrwai aage badhaate hue adaalat ne kaha ki dastavejon ke aadan pradaan kii prakriya 15 janvari tak puri kar lee jaae
 On February 8, the same bench will hear the matter
 yani ek kanoonee masale ke siyaasi pahalu ko ughaadte dhakte ye masalaa ek kadam or aage bad gaya

 This is where the dream merchants do the dream business
 in sapanom ko hakeekat main badalane ke liye har saal hajaaron yuva is mayanagari main khinche chale aate hai
 But when his dream breaks, we meet a world hidden in the glare of the stars, whose tainted face hardly any of us want to see

 phir dhire-dhire ek-duusare ke ghar aana-janaa bhi shuru ho gaya
 The evening of March 6
 plante or uske saathi dhananjay scindia ne kakkad ko mumbai ke lokhandwala ke ek restaraan main kisi financer se milwane ke bahaane bulawaaya
 Then they mixed Karan with a cold drink and gave Karan a drink which he began to fall asleep after drinking
 phir vijay use usee kii bmadblu car main uske ghar oshivara ke obaroy springs apartment main le gaya
 The dose of medicine was high, so Karan went into deep sleep as soon as he reached the flat
 iske baad vijay or dhananjay karan ko bathroom main le gaye or ek tej dhar hathiyaar se uskaa galaa ret kar uski laash ke chaar tukade kar use theliyon main bharkar bathroom main chhupaakar vahaan se chale gaye

 phir unhone chaaron theliyon ko kumbharali ghat main alag-alag jagahon par phenk diya or car ko pune main apane ek saathi ke ghar khadi kar waapas mumbai laut aae
 Before the murder, both had also brought Karan's credit card and other valuables

 haalanki police ne shuruyaat main maamle ko gambhirtha se nahin liya
 Karan's family alleges that the police tried to evade him

 tafteesh main pataa chalaa ki anuj tikku ne apane ghar main do kirayedar rakhe the
 One of them was Dhananjay Shinde
 ye kirayedar model simran sood or gangster plante ne hi rakhwae the
 The plot was that Anuj would be killed and his property worth crores should be captured and then his corpse should be set as a Kakkar corpse
 simran ne plante ko anuj se bhi use karan sood bataakar milwaaya tha
 But the mess became that when Anuj's father Arun Tikku got the news of tenant in the house, he came to Mumbai and expelled Palande's associates from the house
 lihaaja vijay ne anuj tikku se pehle uske pita arun tikku ko hi raste se hataane kaa faisla kar liya
 As part of the plot, Vijay Palande took Anuj to Goa a day before the murder

 a total of 12 stabs were inflicted on him, but the guards became attentive due to the noise during the murder and he informed the police
 lekin police ke pahunchane se pehle hi kaatil khidki se kudakar bhaag gaye
 The police later arrested Simran, Palande and Dhananjay on Anuj's statement
 mumbai police kaa daawa he ki jaldi hi teenon ne apana jurm bhi kabool kar liya
 On the other hand, seeing the pictures of the three in TV and newspapers, Karan Kakkar's family were suddenly shocked
 kyonki plante or scindia vahi the jo karan ke credit card par mal main shopping karte hue sisitivi camere main kaid ho gaye the
 Karan's family immediately reached Mumbai and informed the police about this
 police kii sakhti ke baad to teenon ne karan ke katl kii baat kabool kar lee
 In this way, the secret of one murder to another was revealed
 agar mumbai police karan ke gharavaalon kii shikaayat par pehle mustaidi dikhaati to shaayad arun tikku kii jaan batch jaati
 Now he will have to answer the allegations of Karan's family that why he delayed to file Karan's missing report
 is bich police simran ke haai profile rishton or jaan-pahchaan kii bhi tafteesh kar rahi he
 She was active in Mumbai's Page Three Circle and also attended IPL parties

 During this, Jaitley was questioned over Vijay Mallya's extradition
 iske jawaab main unhone mana ki bharat se england faraar hue kaarobaari vijay maalya ke pratyrpan kaa kaam mushkil he

 Therefore, the Central Government has put a condition to stop the businessmen like Mallya that if someone is willing to buy back his auctioned company then he will have to take the initiative to pay the bank's interest at least in the old loan

 During an event held in Patna, Nitish said about the news of the murder of a hostage policeman that he is not sure about whether this is true or not but he will convince that the news is not true
 mukhyamantri ne sawaal kiya ki bandhak banaae gaye chaar pulicekarmiyon kaa kya kasoor he
 He said that negotiating with someone hostage is not a sign of a higher ideal or good principle
 unhone kaha, ‘ham dusron se keval apeksha kar sakate hai or baatcheet ke liye koun taiyaar nahin, ham to taiyaar baithe hai
 He said that his government protects human rights under all circumstances and is committed to it

 haalanki sarkari str par isaki pushti nahin hui he
 Security was beefed up near the Chief Minister's residence on the news of the killing of one of the police personnel held hostage by the Naxalites and all the routes leading to it were sealed
 haalanki iske kaarnon ko lekar padaadhikari kuch bataane se parhez kar rahe hai
 Avinash, a self-styled spokesperson of the banned Maoist outfit CPI Maoist, said that Abhay Yadav, one of the hostages, was murdered on the orders of his committee after the expiry of the deadline for release
 unhone dhamkee di ki agar jelon main band unke aath saathiyon ko shuukravaar subah 10 baje tak sarkaar nahin chhodti to anya bandhakon kii bhi hatya kar di jaaegi
 Additional Director General of Police (headquarters) PK Thakur clarified that the four hostages are safe and the body found near Abhaipur is not that of Abhay Yadav
 unhone kaha ki pulicekarmiyon kii rihaai ke liye police karrwai jari rahegi
 Earlier, Naxalite spokesperson Avinash said that where the body of Abhay Yadav will be kept, the information will be given to the local police station or media personnel
 is bayaan ke baad lakhisarai ke abhyapur thana kshetra main police ko ek agyaat shav baraamad hua tha
 Avinash said that no initiative has been taken by any outsider nor the government to negotiate with the Naxalites in this matter and their committee will decide about the remaining hostages

 unhone kaha ki sipaahiyon kaa koi kasoor nahin hota, sarkaar jahaan bhejti he ve jate hai
 He said that they are also a part of the society

 rahul ne puche sawalbata den ki congress samet tamaam vipakshi dal in donon ghatnaon ko lekar bijepi par jamkar nishaanaa saadh rahi he
 The Congress has named bjp's rule in Uttar Pradesh as 'ravanaraj'

 Uma Bharti, another firebrand minister of the Modi government, did not react to the Congress's statements but appealed to people to be cautious of those trying to give a communal color to the Kathua incident
 kendriya peyajal mantri uma bharti ne kaha ki ye jaghanya aparaadh he or isaki jitani bhi ninda kii jaae wo kam he

 Maneka Gandhi said that the law is doing its job and the victims will get justice
 haalanki jab menka gandhi se insaaf main deree par sawaal kiya gaya to unhone chuppi saadhane main behatari samajhi
 Not long ago, during the UPA rule at the Center, BJP did not get tired of attacking the Manmohan government for protecting women amid public outcry over the Nirbhaya rape case
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke prachaar ke dauraan bijepi ne naaraa bhi diya tha- ‘bahut hua mahilaon par atyaachaar, abaki baar modi sarkaar’
 The women faces who came out on the streets from BJP to express outrage over the Meenakshinirbhaya rape case spoken on Kathua are no longer tired of cursing the opposition for politics on such incidents
 bijepi saansad minakshi lekhi ne kathua kii ghatana par vipaksh ko aade haath lete kaha ki ve kisi par bhi aarope laga sakate hai, un par bhi jo vahaan maujuud bhi nahin the
 But the law will do its job
 unhen (vipaksh) sansad kaa sammaan nahin aata, unhen kanoon kaa sammaan nahin aata, phir wo kyon aisi bhashaa bol rahe hai
 The BJP leaders may not have much to speak on Kathua and Unnao, but they were seen trying to grab the attention of the people by increasing their fast against the opposition

 kitaabah upsanharlekhakah kashinath singhprakashakah raajakmal prakaashan privet limitedkavarah hardcovermoolyah 250 rupemahabharat yuddh ko adharm par dharm kii jeet maanate hai
 The Pandavas defeated the Kauravas under the guidance of Shri Krishna, but what happened after the Mahabharata? Did peace and peace prevail after this crusade? Kashinath Singh's book epilogue will give you the answer to these questions as well as make you aware of the form of Shri Krishna about which you have hardly imagined
 shri krishna kii bal lila, raas lila ke bare main aap bahut pard chuke honge, lekin unki vivashtaa or aatmaglani ke bare main shaayad hi aapane kabhi kuch padhaa ho
 As much as this book belongs to Shri Krishna, it is as much as Dwarka's creation and its destruction
 mahabharat yuddh ke baad sabko laga tha har taraf aman or shanti hogi lekin aisa kuch nahin hua balki pandavon ke rajya main adharm or ashaanti kii paraakaashtha dekhne ko mil rahi thi
 There was a drought in the state and Yudhishthira was running away from his responsibilities
 mahabharat ke dauraan shri krishna ne jo chal kiye the uski keemat unhen apni neend or chaiyn kii bali dekar chukaani pad rahi thi
 This form of Shri Krishna, away from divine supernaturalism, is that of a man whose failures behind extraordinary achievements are now coming out one by one
 shri krishna kaise ek bhagwaan se vivish insaan ban gaye, itane vivash ho gaye ki apane rajya or praja kisi ko bhi nahin bachaa sake
 After the Mahabharata war, he kept saying that he could stop this war if he wanted
 jo samudr shri krishna kaa paanv dhota tha wo bhi mahabharat yuddh ke baad unase naaraaz rahane laga tha
 The form of Maharishi Durvasa in the epilogue will surprise you
 durvasa apane gusse ke liye jane jate hai or jab wo dwarka aate hai to shri krishna puri koshish karte hai ki maharishi durvasa ko thodaa sa bhi gussa nahin aae
 In the same attempt, at the behest of Durvasa, Shri Krishna falls completely naked with his wife Rukmini but still does not escape the curse of Durvasa and which ultimately leads to his death
 yah kahani bahut rochak he or ishwar kii maanviya vivashtaa kii ore ingit karti he
 The epilogue also describes the anger of Dau over the slaying of Duryodhana by Bhima and also of Sri Krishna's yearning for Radha
 radha or krishna ke prem ko behad yakini dhang se dikhaaya gaya he
 The Krishna who appears in front of the great form of the 18 Akshohini army lost sight in Kurukshetra
 upsanhaar manushya hone kii traasadee, niyati or sangharsh kii kahani he
 The epilogue is the story of the movement between war and peace
 yah upanyaas kashinath singh kii ab tak kii ravaayat se bahut hatakar he
 Kashi is best known for his humor and timely satirical novel Kashi Ka eighty
 magar upsanhaar ek nae dwaar kii ore prasthaan he
 Those interested in Indian myths, ancient stories and especially the Mahabharata must read this book

 David Coleman Headley, who came out of America to make Mumbai cry tears, was oblivious to what he was going to do
 darasal, lashkar ne use yah bhanak hi nahin lagane di ki jahaan use focus rakhane ko kaha gaya he, vah asal nishaanaa he hi nahin
 He did not even know what was the reason for the attack in Mumbai
 hedli ko tha nirdesh- siddhivinayak mandir par rakho focusalashkar commander sajid mir ne hedli ko mukhya rup se mumbai ke prasiddh siddhivinayak mandir par focus rakhane ko kaha tha
 However, he was also instructed to videography the second floor of Taj Hotel and every corner of the hotel
 ek or task tha- taj ke conference haul, railway stesan or world trade centre kii videography
 Headley said these things in his testimony the other day
 isse pehle vah bataa chukaa he ki use reki kii jimmedaari di gai thi
 After all, why did Mumbai become the target of terrorists? Headley said - i just don't know
 i was working with ISI and ISI Lashkar
 Headley said that Pakistani intelligence agency ISI was in touch with lashkar-e-taiba
 usne kaha, 'main iesai ke liye bhi kaam kar rahaa tha
 During this, he also met many officers of Pakistani army
 mujhe laga tha ki iesai or lashkar milakar kaam kar rahe hai
 Headley also confessed that the ISI had asked him to be a spy from the Indian Army
 paisa ISI or moral saport kaa or aatank lashkar kahedli ne apni gavaahi main bataaya ki sena, jaish-e-mohammad, lashkar-e-taiyaba or hijbul mujahidin jaise aatanki guton ko sari aarthik madad iesai hi karti thi
 Even ISI officers used to give moral support to terrorist groups
 vah khud iesai ke major ikbaal ke sampark main tha
 Know, how David Headley did in Pakistan on the first day's testimony, it was not possible to take the terrorists and terrorists to the conference hall
 use conference kaa puraa shedul jutaney main kahin se bhi kamyaabi nahin mili
 Its dummy was also made, but later the plan of attack was canceled
 lashkar kaa nishaanaa conference haul main hone vaali raksha vaigyanikon kii baithak thi
 Headley Neswal did not answer these 2 questions: How much money was given to him for working for Lashkar and ISI? Answer: Cannot answer this question
 sawallsajid mir ke alaava lashkar kaa koi khaas aadmi, jo nirdesh detaa tha?javaabah kisi ek kaa naam bataa paanaa mushkil he

 Social video war does not seem to stop between political parties in Madhya Pradesh
 taaja maamla madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantrishivraj singh chouhanake khilaafasoshal mediaper jari ek video kaa he
 In this video, Shivraj Singh Chauhan is depicted dragging Draupadi as a misdemeanor
 shivaraj singh chouhan ke khilaaf is video ke khilaafabijepine morcha khol diya he
 Madhya Pradesh BJP vice-president Rameshwar Sharma lashed out at the Congress, saying that what goes on in the mind of the Congress, they embody the character of others
 bijepi ke charitra main mahilaon kaa sammaan he, kanyapujan se lekar kanyadan tak kii yojanaon ko lekar aaen hai
 a Congress burning in the oven can do the same
 congress kaa asli charitra hi duhshasan kaa he, lekin inaki jo aukaat nahin he wo bananaa chaahate hai
 In the video, apart from Shivraj, ministers Narottam Mishra, Kailash Vijayvargiya and Bhopal Mayor Alok Sharma are shown as Kauravas, while Congress state president Kamal Nath is shown as Krishna
 vahiin tazaa video par congress kaa kahana he ki isamen congress nahin balki bijepi se hi kisi dukhi shakhkh kaa banaaya video he
 Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said in a clarification that the BJP puts people in the social media team on a hefty salary and hence it may be that a member of the BJP made the video viral if the salary was less
 isse pehle madhya pradesh main congress or bhaajapa ke netaaon ke khilaaf bane kai video pradesh main viral ho chuke hai
 Somewhere, the Chief Minister is being awarded Bahubali and Angad, and Iron Man somewhere
 vahiin congress adhyaksh kamalnath bhi halk banakar shivaraj singh chouhan ko pachhadte najar aa chuke hai
 Seeing the way in which the videos of politicians mocking the social media are going viral in Madhya Pradesh assembly elections, it seems that even if the issues are not dominating in the elections, the viral videos mocking the social media are definitely going to dominate

 Wicket-keeper batsman Jose Butler feels that England will have to be more precise in certain aspects such as catching, which can also help them win the second Test against India starting at the Lords on Thursday
 viraat kohli ne bhale hi siries ke shuruaati match main shandaar shatak jadaa he, lekin butler ko is baat kaa santosh he ki bhartiya captain ko ran banane ke liye mashkkat kerani padi
 Kohli appeals to the fans- Supporting all the players of the team, Butler wrote on Sky Sports, 'kohli scored a great century in the first innings, but you also have to give credit to the bowlers
 unhen saare ran banane ke liye mashkkat kerani padi or hamane kuch maukey bhi banaae, lekin ham inkaa phayda nahin uthaa sake
 The same thing was right for us, but we will try more accurately

 ham pehali pari main teen wicket ganvaakar 216 ran par the, jisamen jo root or johny beresto kaaphi acha kar rahe the, par ham iskaa laabh nahin uthaa sake

 ’udhar, english captain jo root ne kaha, ‘isse (birmingham kii jeet se) hamaara kaaphi manobal badha he
 The most interesting thing of last week was that we did not do our best, there are some areas in which we can improve, but we found a way to win under pressure and turn the match in our favor
 ’lords main barabari ke liye betaab team india, lekin ye aankade hai daraavneberesto ne kaha, ‘hamen do kshetron main kuch sudhaar kii jarurat he, jabaki vyaktigat rup se meraa khel thik rahaa isliye main or zyada behatar karne kii koshish karuunga
 'all-rounder Ben Stokes played a key role in the win at Edgbaston, but he will not be part of the team in the Lord's Test and Butler said that the team will miss him a lot
 unhone kaha, ‘stokes kii lords par kaaphi kami khalegi, lekin ham jaanate the ki vah shaamil nahin ho paaenge

 ajtak par sidhi baat main unhone sampadak prabhu chawla ko bataaya ki ve desh kii pradhanmantri banakar rahengi
 Excerpts from the conversation: Dakhir's daughter as future prime minister
 dalit kii beti hone ke alaava main bharat kii bhi beti hum
 i have not only worked for Dalits but for all sections of society
 main bharat main paidaa hui, to main sirf dalit kii nahin balki hindustan kii bhi beti hum
 You said that a conspiracy is being hatched to stop the daughter of Dalit from becoming Prime Minister
 unhen dar he ki yadi basapa centre main sarkaar banaati he or mayawati pradhanmantri banati he to unhen centre main satta main lautne ke liye lanbaa intjaar karnaa padegaa
 So he felt that i should not let him come to power
 to ve aapako pradhanmantri nahin banane denge?yadi main uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri ban sakati hum to meraa khyaal he ki hamaare logon kaa sapana ek din jarur puraa hoga
 Are you sure that nothing can stop you? a movement has started
 agar sarv samaaj mujhe vot detaa he to koi takat mujhe pradhanmantri banane se nahin roak sakati
 Then what will be the agenda of your administration? Your opinion on privatization and economic reforms initiated by the Manmohan Singh government? My party is not against privatization
 jaisaa ki hamane uttar pradesh main kiya, centre main bhi ham khyaal rakhenge ki desh kii anusuchit jati ke log aarakshan kaa phayda uthaaen
 When a government enterprise is privatized, the rights of reservation should be protected, as i have done in my state
 retail main pratyaksh videshi nivesh hona chahie?chote dukandaaron ke hiton kii raksha kii jaani chahie
 Your opinion on nuclear deal? Congress claims that due to this agreement we will get cheap electricity
 yah galat he
 Whatever power we get will be expensive and we will have to wait for 10-15 years
 ab ham jo paa rahe hai, usase sirf 8-10 fisadi adhik milegaa
 And it will be so expensive that neither the poor, nor small industries will be able to benefit from it
 yadi aapke netritv main yuanpie sarkaar satta main aati he to ise radd kar degi?yadi meri sarkaar centre main banati he to ham nishchit rup se is par punarvichaar karenge
 Your opponents claim that your politics is caste based
 aise bebuniyaad bayaan ve log hi de rahe hai, jo khud jati aadhaarit raajnneeti main uljhe hai
 Do you think that since you have become a serious contender for the post of UNPA leader and Prime Minister, they are trying to humiliate you? i am the leader of BSP

 But according to mathematics you need support of Congress or BJP to become Prime Minister

 The state and central governments should sit together and adopt a strategy to overcome this
 haa, hamaari simaaen kamjor hai, jisase unhen madad milti he
 It is the responsibility of the Central Government to prevent infiltration on the border and the state government is responsible for enacting strong anti-terrorism laws
 pota jaise sakht kanoon?jaruri nahin pota jaise
 But be strict

 Attacking the Congress, he said that after the natural disaster in 2013, he wanted to serve for the reconstruction of Kedarnath, as the CM of Gujarat, he would do something here Did not want to, the state government of Uttarakhand was also ready, but when the news of this to the people in Delhi (UPA government was in Delhi in 2013), there was a stir and they were refused

 The Congress has retaliated against Ravi Shankar Prasad's attack
 congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne kaha ki hitler kaa ek sahyogi goebells tha
 Similarly, Modi ji's minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is the Goebbels of the government
 bijepi sarkaar phek news banane vaali factory jaisi ho gai he
 Surjewala launched a scathing attack on the BJP and said that the biggest data thieves are making the most noise
 koun tha goebelssurajevaala ne jis joseph goebells se ravishankar prasad kii tulana kii, wo hitler kaa sahyogi tha
 Goebbels was a minister in Hitler's government
 goebells hitler ke behad bharosemand logon main shaamil tha
 Why was the Congress silent for five months: Ravi Shankar: Earlier, Ravi Shankar Prasad asked that if the Congress Party and Rahul Gandhi do not have relations with Cambridge Analytica, then why should he remain silent for five months? Prasad told Aaj Tak, 'there were several media reports about Cambridge Analytica being associated with Congress five months ago
 tab ise bijepi ke khilaaf congress kaa brahmastra tak bataaya gaya tha lekin ab data chori kii baat saamne ai to congress khud ko cambridge analitica se alag karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 'rahul had also said that on Thursday itself, Congress President Rahul Gandhi alleged in a tweet that the government had stolen a data theft case to divert attention from the issue when he was caught lying about the death of 39 Indians in Iraq
 Is deliberately uprooted
 isi par aaj bijepi netaa ravishankar prasad ne jawaab diya tha
 BJP did not take the services of the suspected companies, however, when Prasad was asked that Ovleno Business Intelligence (OBI), partner of Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL), parent company of Cambridge Analytica Company, in India was taken by BJP, Janata Dal United and Congress
 So his reply was that BJP never used the services of this company
 prasad ne ye bhi kaha ki cambridge analitica company kii sthapana 2013 main hui
 Prasad also said that the question is not just about which party sought the help of which organization
 asal mudda yah he ki kya chunaav prachaar ke liye un hatkandon kaa istemaal kiya gaya, jis kaa aarope cambridge analitica company par laga he
 JCU leader KC Tyagi has also clarified the allegations of his son being involved in the data leak, that all the allegations are baseless
 unhone ravishankar prasad se puure maamle kii jaanch kii maang bhi kii he
 Casey Tyagi said that the son Amrish's company and Cambridge Analytics accused of data theft was only concerned with work
 donon main kisi bhi prakaar kaa naa to vittiya len-dein hua tha, or naa hi koi hissedari thi
 Tyagi said that they are fully prepared for the investigation
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki unki party jediu kaa isse koi sambandh nahin he
 He even said that no help was taken in the 2010 elections as well
 shivasena or uski varisht sahyogi bhaajapa (BJP) ke bich sarkaar banane ke liye takaraar chal rahi he
 The Shiv Sena is demanding 50:50 percent participation in power, including half term of the chief minister's post
 athavle ne bataaya, 'mujhe nahin lagata ki shivasena ko mukhyamantri kaa pad milegaa
 But he can take more cabinet portfolios in the Maharashtra government and an additional ministerial post at the center
 'unhone kaha, 'agar rajya main (sarkaar banane ko lekar chal rahaa gatirodh dur na hone kii sthiti main) phir se chunaav hote hai to yah bhaajapa shivasena ke liye bada nuksaan hoga
 BJP should also consider Shiv Sena's demand
 athavle ne kaha, 'shivasena kaa (sarkaar banane ke liye) congress-rakanpa ke saath janaa bhi acha nahin lagegaa
 'let me tell you that Ramdas Athawale's party RPI contested in Maharashtra together with Shiv Sena and BJP
 khatm ho jaaenge jameen se jude bhrashtachar ke maamlevikas kaaryon main hogi sarkaar or logon ko aasaanikuch samay baad nahin hogi jameen kii registry
 You will not have to visit the Registry Office or Patwari in the case of measles-khatauni
 aapako sirf ek number de diya jayega
 Such as Aadhaar number or passport number
 sirf ek number main hi aapke jameen kii sari jaankaree feed hogi
 It can be like barcode
 taaki sirf aap apane mobile se barcode scan karen or apane jameen se sambandhit sari jaankaree hasil kar len
 If this happens, conflicts in the future will reduce
 ye bhi ho saktaa he ki adaalaton main jameenon ke vivaad zyada na pahunche
 All this will be possible through geotagging or geocoding
 yani aapaki jameen ke lokation (sthaan) ko longitude-latitude ke aadhaar par ek code number de diya jayega
 With the help of this, you will be able to search your land on the Internet in future
 jeepies yaa bhartiya nevigation system kii madad se aasaani se pataa khoj sakenge
 Now what you find with the help of GPS and sometimes you get stuck back and forth from the fixed address, this will not happen
 world jeeyospetial council ke founder or secretary general sanjay kumaar
 Aajtak in se vishesh baatcheet karte hue world jeeyospetial council ke founder or secretary general sanjay kumaar ne yah jaankaree di
 He described how our world is going to change with geospatial services and facilities in the future
 transport, mobile, health, kanjumar delivery, masping aadi sabhi kaamon main jeeyospetial sevaaon or suvidhaon kaa upyog kiya jayega
 Because the future will be based on location based data
 malaysia or indonesia main jameenon kii jeeyocoding ho rahi haisanjay kumaar ne bataaya ki jameen ke registration (registry) ko lekar kai viksit deshon main jeeyocoding yaa geotaging kii vyavastha lagu kar di gai he
 Even Malaysia and Indonesia have this system
 in donon deshon main to ucch sateekta surveykshan (hai prisisan survey) ke liye jeeyocoding or geotaging ko hi manyata he
 These countries have a separate team of surveyors for geocoding / geotagging the land
 inaki alag sanstha he
 Sanjay said that he fully hopes that the government can reduce the court cases related to land by geocoding or geotagging people's lands in the next five years if they want to
 jammu-kashmir-ladakh ke baad ab ganga kaa nayaa nakshaa banegaa, mishan mod main ho rahaa kaamadesh main main abhi nahin jeeyocoding se jude praavdhansanjay kumaar ne bataaya ki bharat kaa nakshaa banaati he survey of india lekin uske paas abhi tak yah vyavastha nahin he ki vah jameenon kii jeeyocoding yaa geotaging kare
 Also, create such wings in your department that work only for geocoding or geotagging of lands
 lekin is kaam ke liye is santhaan ko chunanaa chahie or inhen aise adhikaar dene chahie
 Before 1905, the Survey of India had the task of registering or registering land and making maps in the country
 lekin uske baad raajnneetik kaarnon ke chalate survey of india ke paas se ye kaam hataa liya gaya
 Only the work of making maps was given
 vibhaag badalane se adaalaton main bad gaye jameen ke maamlesanjay kumaar ne bataaya ki 1905 ke baad jab se jameen registry kaa maamla bhu-sansaadhan or gramin vikaas vibhaag ke paas aayaa tab se adaalaton main jameen se jude maamle bad gaye
 The biggest reason for this was that there was no administrative survey of land boundaries
 patawaari ek latthe par nakshaa rakhata tha, usee main nishaan lagaakar logon ko bataata tha ki aapaki jameen kitni he
 There were so many doubts about the ownership of land boundaries that lakhs of land related cases are pending in courts
 think tanks kii maang, bhusthanik suvidhaon ke liye piemo banaae rashtriya ranneetigiocoding yaa geotaging se malikana haq ke vivaad khatm hongesanjay kumaar ne bataaya ki sarkaar ne jis tarah rupayon kaa demonetigeshan kiya tha, vaise hi jameenon kaa bhi demonetigeshan kare or inhon atyaadhunik jeeyocoding yaa geotaging kare to kisi ko bhi dikkat nahin hogi
 Because after geocoding, the right map of your property, its right size, the right size will all fall within a number
 jaisaa ki aadhaar number ke saath he
 It contains all the information about you
 sarkaar chaah le to agle paanch saalon main jameenon kii jeeyocoding yaa geotaging ho sakati he
 However, it will be as complex and complex as the census
 jameenon kii jeeyomeping ho to khatm ho sabase bada bhrashtacharsanjay kumaar ne bataaya ki agar sarkaar jameenon kii satellite yaa jeeyomeping karne lage to rajanetaaon, prashasnic adhikariyon or gundon kii mileebhagat khatm ho jaaegi
 That is, corruption cases related to land will end
 nahin hue to kam ho jaaenge
 Because the work of land mafias is bigger than black money in the country
 inhi kii vajah se dimonetigeshan main dikkat ai or vah lagbhag fail ho gaya tha
 Former ISRO chief said - Indian GPS will soon be on everyone's mobile, what did the company benefit from the geospatial? Sanjay Kumar said that geospatial services and facilities will protect, transport, health, mobile, health, consumer delivery, mapping Etc
 the country will get a lot of help
 logon ko lokation aadhaarit jaankariyaan aasaani se milengi
 People use geospatial facilities every day but they do not know
 aap online khaanaa mangate hai, taxi se jate hai
 These are all location based services
 inhen jeeyospetial kehete hai
 Think how much profit will be made if geospatial facilities increase
 ab paaramparik yuddh nahin hote, trade war hote hansanjay kumaar ne bataaya ki ab paaramparik war yuddh nahin hote
 There are trade wars
 ye trade war deshon kii jeeopojishan yani jiyolocation dekhte hue hote hai
 As America did against India in 1991
 rus ne bhi madad karne se manaa kar diya tha
 This still happens
 jeeyospetial kii jarurat kyon he desh ko?sanjay kumaar ne bataaya ki 1997 ke aasapaas aapako desh ke nakshe aasaani se nahin milte the
 The maps were not in the public domain at all
 ye nakshe raksha mantralay, survey of india yaa gine-chune sansthaanon ke paas hote the
 Then i started working on maps

 One time you will feel that there is strong suspense in the film, but in the end neither the audience will get suspense nor the story
