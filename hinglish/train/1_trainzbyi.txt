 isse uttar pradesh main bhi sapa or basapa ke kushasan se mukti kii shuruyaat ho gai he
 With the re-entry of Ajit, there has been a long army of peasant leaders in the NDA
 darasal, ajit ke aane se pehle se hi rajg main kisaan netaaon kii bharmaar thi
 Identification of NDA partners like Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) chief Omprakash Chautala, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Swatantra Bharat Paksha President Sharad Joshi in Maharashtra have been associated with farming
 badal kaa punjab ke kisaanon main asar he, to haryana main chautaala ke inelod kaa
 Joshi has been known as the leader of the Shetkari Sanghatana in many areas of Maharashtra for the last nearly three decades
 bihar main nitish kumaar kaa aisi khetihar jatiyon par prabhaav he jo lalu yadav ke rashtriya janata dal se dur rahi hai
 At the same time, Ajit has influence over Jat farmers in western Uttar Pradesh
 in sabake bich sutaradhar kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe, rajg ke kaaryakari sanyojak, sharad yadav bhi kisaan prishthbhumi ke hi hai
 He says, "comparison of NDA leaders with upa's Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, p
 chidambaram, kamalnath se karenge to paaenge ki hamaare paas kisaanon or gaanv-garib kaa dard samajhane vaale netaa hai, unke paas aise log na ke baraabar hai
 "but this is not just about the NDA
 iskaa netritv karne vaali bhaajapa main bhi anek kisaan netaa saamne aae hai
 While the identity of the party has been such a Brahmin and Baniya-based party whose voters used to live only in cities, its image is seen changing
 madhya pradesh main party ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan hon yaa phir karnataka ke mukhyamantri bi
 s
 yeddiurppa, ve bhi kisaan hai
 Party President Rajnath, who was the Agriculture Minister in the last years of the previous NDA government, is also a farmer
 ve kehete hai, ''ham kisaanon ko vot bank kii tarah nahin istemaal karte
 His concern for the UPA was in the last year and that too with no mind
 kisaanon ke sachche hitaishi ham hi hai
 "they say that if the NDA wins this election and forms a government, the farmers will be given loans at less than four per cent interest rate and agriculture income will be insured, which will be given 75 per cent premium by the central government
" vahiin, ajit kehete hai, ''upie kii chhavi kisaanon ke bich isiilie chaupat hui ki kisaanon ke liye banaai gai uski yojanaon ko dharaatal tak pahunchane ke liye kaaryakartaaon kaa tantra uske paas nahin he
 He says that in 1990, the Janata Dal government gave farmers 10,000
 tak ke karj maafee karne kaa faisla kiya tha, jo aaj kii keemat par kam-se-kam dedh lakh ru
 Should be ve chintaa jataate hai, ''maujuuda karj maafee kaa phayda unheen kisaanon ko mil rahaa he jinhone ek bhi kist nahin adaa kii thi
 Those who paid a single installment are not getting any benefit
 ''darasal, kisaanon ke bich paith banane ke liye bhaajapa pehle se hi sakriy he
 The party held rallies in Vidarbha region amid farmer suicides and the party president also went there
 jahaan uttar pradesh main rahane tak bhaajapa adhyaksh is baat se chintit the ki unki chhavi thakur netaa kii he, vahiin dilli aane ke baad unhone apni pahchaan ko vyapak banane kii koshishon ke tahat kisaanon ko chunaa jabaki unki party main rashtriya str par aise chehron kaa abhaav rahaa he, jisase kisaan varg khud ko judaa hua mahasoos kar sake
 
 unhone kisaanon se jude mudde uthaane shuru kiye
 At the same time, it made inroads among the peasant leaders of the allies
 sharad yadav kaa saath unke liye is maamle main madadgaar sabit hua
 On the other hand, to make these efforts comprehensive, the governments of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh of BJP are also trying to woo the farmers through new schemes
 is tarah ab bhaajapa or uske sahyogi dalon main is samay jitne kisaan netaa hai, utane upie main nahin hai
 Although Sharad Pawar and Lalu Yadav etc
 in the UPA government pressed for the debt waiver scheme of farmers, their influence is limited to Maharashtra and Bihar
 rajnath kehete hai, ''abhi bhi kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai
 This proves that the UPA government has not been able to identify the real problem of the farmers
 ''lekin is jamaavade ko kisaanon kii naaraazgi se vot batorne kii jarurat he
 Before the elections, the NDA had to hold two big rallies of farmers in Chandigarh and Delhi, they could not be done
 vahiin bhaajapa adhyaksh ke griharajya uttar pradesh main bhi party main kisaan netaaon kaa akaal he
 The condition is that billions of rupees for the relief of farmers in drought-hit Bundelkhand
 kii jo package raashi ai, uskaa adhikansh hissaa raturaat paudhe lagane ke naam par kharch kar diya gaya or kaaphi raashi computer aadi kii kharidari par kharch kii ja rahi he
 Everyone knows why government officials are eager to spend any amount in shopping
 lekin bhaajapa ke paas pradesh main kisaanon kii naaraazgi ko swar dene vaale netaa nahin hai
 In fact, in the era of globalization, farmers have become mere vote banks
 desh kii adhikansh aabaadi jahaan kheti par nirbhar he, vahiin kisaan hi sabase bada utpaadak bhi he, upabhokta bhi or kharidaar bhi he
 But unfortunately no government takes the initiative to increase farmers' income and make agriculture an attractive business
 aazaadee ke chah dashak ke baad bhi kheti aisa pesha he, jise apanaakar koi khush nahin dikhataa, isliye khud ko kisaan bataane main pichhadepan kaa ehsaas karata he
 For the sake of vote bank, it is a fashion for many leaders to call themselves' farmers' sons', so it will be a matter of seeing how far the NDA is able to understand the helpless farmers through their farmer leaders

 com / paucfrhnbc — Ajay Maken (@ajaymaken) January 18, 2018 In fact, there was a GST council meeting in Delhi on Thursday, which lasted till late in the evening as there were many things on the agenda
 kai chizon par to is baar nirnay hi nahin ho paaya
 Dinner was organized by Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal for the council members
 jiesti kii baithak khatm hone ke baad jab rajyon ke vitt mantri or varisht adhikari aayojan sthal vigyaan bhawan ke haul se baahar aa rahe, to saat ghante se khabaron ke intjaar main lage patrakaron ne unhen gher liya
 Finance ministers of most states took turns in giving bites to journalists
 lekin dilli ke dipti siem or vitt mantri manish sisodiya ne patrakaron se baat karne se manaa kar diya
 He looked a little impatient
 unhone sabhi rajyon ke vitt mantriyon ke kaan main kuch baat kahi or uske baad apane adhikariyon-karmchaariyon ko kuch nirdesh die
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal organized a dinner at the famous Five Senses Garden in Delhi for all the members who attended the GST Council meeting
 kejariwal sidhe dinar venue par pahunch gaye the or unhone manish sisodiya ko jimmedaari di thi ki ve jiesti concil ke sadasyon ko lekar vahaan pahunchen
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was preparing to go home, but Sisodia requested him to go to dinner too
 jetali ne apane junior mantrishiv pratap shuklase poocha ki kya unhone garden (dinar aayojan sthal) dekha he? shukla ne kaha nahin, lekin unhone kaha ki ve bhi dinar main chalane ko taiyaar hai
 After this, the Finance Minister arrived at Kejriwal's dinner
 sabhi logon ko yah dekhakar kaaphi acha laga, kyonki manahani maamle main donon netaaon ke bich bani kadavaahat kisi se chhipi nahin he
 No information was shared about the dinner by the media in-charge of the GST Council and the Finance Minister, but many good pictures have been shared on the Twitter handle of the Aam Aadmi Party
 in tasveeron main dikh rahaa he ki jetali or kejariwal bilkul paas main baithe hai
 To avoid the cold, Arun Jaitley arrived with a golden shawl
 unhone kejariwal se baat to bahut kam kii, lekin donon ke chehre par muskaraahat dikh rahi thi
 The dinner venue Five Senses Garden is spread over about 20 acres in the saeed-ul-ajayib area near Mehrauli
 ise rajdhani ke behtareen harittage or activity jone main se mana jaataa he
 Kejriwal was accompanied by Deputy CM Manish Sisodia along with Delhi's Food and Supplies Minister Imran Hussain
 dilli sarkaar ne sabhi atithiyon ko aayojan sthal tak pahunchane ke liye 8 lagjri bason kii bhi vyavastha kii thi
 Many guests even resorted to metro, then cabs to avoid traffic jams and delays
 gauratlab he ki arun jetali ne kejariwal ke alaava ke ashutosh, kumaar vishwaas, sanjay singh, raghav chaddha or deepak bajpeyi ke khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa kiya he
 The leaders of the AAP alleged corruption during Arun Jaitley's presidency in the DDCA, which Arun Jaitley has claimed defamation of Rs 10 crore
 manahani ke mukademe kii vajah se donon netaaon main bhale hi kitni kadavaahat ho, lekin acchhee baat yah he ki donon ne yah bhuulakar ek acha jescher dikhaaya or dinar kaa anand liya
 Regarding the allegations of alleged corruption in the Commonwealth Games, the government assured Parliament that it would take all necessary action in this regard
 usne kaha ki is maamle main sambandhit agenciyon ko teji se karrwai kerani chahie or iske liye jo bhi jimmedaar ho use pakadana chahie
 In response to a short notice question in the Rajya Sabha, Sports Minister MS Gill said, "the government will do everything possible to prevent corruption
" agar aisa kuch he to main vitt mantri sahit sambhddha praadhikariyon ko patr likh kar in aaropon par gambhirthapurvak dekhne ke liye kahuunga
 He, however, rejected the demand to set up an apex committee to oversee the preparations for these games
 kendriya satarkta ayog or niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak ke nishkarshon kaa sandarbh dete hue unhone kaha ki agenciyon ko teji se karrwai kerani chahie or iske liye jo bhi jimmedaar ho, use pakadana chahie
 Gill rejected the demand of nominated member Mani Shankar Aiyar and bjp's Vikram Verma that a similar high-powered committee should be set up to oversee the preparation of Commonwealth Games projects as the committee set up for the 1982 Asian Games was
 khel mantri ne kaha ‘‘aisi samitiyaan kuch nahin karatin
 "he said Iyer has international experience", but i have administrative experience
 agar samitiyaan desh kii samasya hal kar saktin to hamaare paas aisi das samitiyaan hotin kintu samaadhaan yah nahin he
 Iyer had demanded that a high-powered committee should be set up under the chairmanship of Gill to monitor the preparations for the Games

 Former Indian Premier League commissioner Lalit Modi on Thursday made a sensational claim that the three players of Chennai Super Kings have links with real estate big businessman who is also a bookie
 unhone kaha ki is vyavsaayee ke gurunath mayppan or anya frenchiji maalikon ke saath bhi kareebi sambandh hai
 Modi claimed in a tweet that the real estate businessman also tried to acquire an IPL franchise in 2010 but did not approve
 modi ne kaha ki isane superkings ke khilaadiyon ko flats bhi die hai
 Modi, however, did not reveal the man's name
 landan main rah rahe modi ne twit kiya, ‘vishwast sutron se abhi abhi soochna mili ki chennai superkings ke teen khilaadiyon ko nite club ke maalik real estate vyavsaayee ke saath dekha gaya tha
 'modi alleged,' the real estate king also does betting and has given flats to these people in New Bandra Sea Face Complex and Noida
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘agar soochna sahi he to is vyakti ko tisare saal main team ke liye boli lagane se roak diya gaya tha jab main chairman tha
 'modi said,' This speculative real estate businessman has close ties with the guru and some other owners
 ’ modi ne kaha ki mumbai police ko is maamle kii jaanch kerani chahie
 Shukla told that the young man had gone to meet her at the girl's house, where the girl's family saw both of them in an objectionable state

 darasal is chaatra ne shuukravaar ko soshal netwarking website fasebuk par mukhyamantri kii aalochana kii thi, or ravivaar ko uski post bahut bade hording kii shakl main sadak kinare lagi hui dikhi
 The postgraduate student at Calcutta University is very scared now
 sadak kinare lage is hording ke alaava use trinmul congress se judi sthaneey mahilaon kii ore se dhamkiyaan bhi mil rahi hai
 The Dum Dum Ward 8 Citizens Committee, which imposes this hoarding, believes that if this girl has the right to criticize the Chief Minister in a democracy, then other people also have the right to publicly raid her due to this democracy
 hording main kaha gaya he, "ham mukhyamantri kii aalochana kii ninda karte hai
 
 
 " kalakatta uniwarsity kii is chaatra ko devi durga kii murtiyon kaa juluus nikaale jane par naaraazgi thi, jisaki agavaani pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri ne shuukravaar ko khud kii thi, or ise 'rio carnival ko kolkata kaa jawaab' ke rup main prachaarit kiya gaya tha
 The student believed that this is not the right time to visit, because at this time the state is grappling with problems of unemployment and poverty
 uske kuch mitron ne chaatra se sahmati jataai, lekin kuch isse sahamat nahin the
 However, it was not known how the Citizens' Committee, which installed the billboards, had access to the student's Facebook page
 sthaneey nivasee dipadas chaatra ke vichaaron se katai sahamat nahin hai
 He retorted, "how can a 21-year-old girl say all this
" 
 
 khaastaur se tab, jab mukhyamantri rajya ke liye itnaa kuch kar rahi hai
 
 
 " trinmul congress ke sthaneey parshad avijit mitra ne kaha, chaatra ke post kii ek line, jahaan vah kahati he ki mukhyamantri ko nadi main dubkee lagavai jaani chahie, kaaphi apmanjanak he, or isi line kii vajah se maamle ne tool pakad liya
 Mitra also said, "this hoarding is the propaganda of the Marxist Communist Party (CPM or CPM)
 
 
 yah ladki unheen kii chaatr shakha esefai (students federation of india) kii sadsy he
 
 
 And they are trying to take political advantage from this issue
 
 
 main us hording ko tab tak nahin hatvaayuungaa, jab tak sthaneey log likhit main mujhase aisa karne kaa anurodh nahin karte, varanaa ve kahenge, maine hi use lagavaaya tha
 
 
 "comments khayr, iske baavjood kuch log aise bhi hai, jo chaatra se sahamat dikhe

 jab 9 november kii subah ashok chavaan ko ek jatke main hataa diya gaya to ve sann rah gaye
 But he is the first in the line of chief ministers to be evicted from a chair due to morality or misrule
 unke peeche abhi kai mukhyamantri line main lage hai
 Next year, new chief ministers may arrive in Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Kerala, Karnataka, West Bengal, Jammu and Kashmir and Tamil Nadu
 in rajyon ke maujuuda mukhyamantriyon ko yaa to alaakaman baahar kaa rasta dikhaa degaa yaa matadaata hi unhen kursi se utaar denge
 While welcoming Barack Obama, Ashok did not even assume that this was his last main role
 tivi ke ek patrkaar ne 6 november ko unase aisi ashanka jataai to unhone naaraazgi se use khaarij kar diya tha
 Unaware of the outcome, Ashok also called a cabinet meeting on 10 November
 isse ek din pehle ve apane guru sai baba ke do bhakton se milane vaale the
 But who can avoid Honi, not even 'god'
 subah 9
 At 15, he was informed that Sonia Gandhi had accepted his resignation
 prithviraj chavaan unka ekmaatr vikalp the, kyonki maharashtra congress main ve akele netaa hai jin par kisi ghotaale kaa daag nahin he
 Prithviraj initially hesitated to accept this position
 par aaj mistar clin ko mukhyamantri kii kursi kii jitani jarurat he, usase zyada congress ko mistar clin kii jarurat he, par party hit haaavee rahe
 In his last attempt to defend himself, Ashok wrapped up all the contenders like Vilasrao Deshmukh, Narayan Rane and Sushil Kumar Shinde in the Adarsh scam
 par ve prithviraj kii chhavi ko kalankit nahin kar paae
 The former chief minister was close to Rahul Gandhi
 rahul ko lekar ve itane aashwast the ki jab ve istipha dene ke liye 10 janpath ja rahe the to pehali baar sonia ke taqatvar raajnneetik sachiv ahamed patel ke nivas par gaye
 The 64-year-old Prithviraj has the blessings of the Congress' powerful trio - mother, son and prime minister
 bhale hi ve jamini netaa nahin hai
 There are very few Congress Chief Ministers
 sharad pavaar ke saath unka sameekaran bhi acha nahin
 This is a bonus for Prithviraj in the 10 Janpath marksheet, but it is also a hindrance in running a coalition government with NCP
 baharhaal, pavaar ne nae mukhyamantri kaa swaagat kiya he
 The NCP is not happy in a private conversation
 use dukh he ki congress ne pavaar ke kattar virdohi ko chunaa he
 Angry NCP replaced Sharad Pawar's nephew, Maratha leader Ajit Pawar, on the chair of the Deputy Chief Minister, replacing Chhagan Bhujbal, a backward caste in the state
 yah congress ke liye ek sanket he
 Both Prithviraj and Ajit are Marathas
 congress ne rakanpa se anurodh kiya tha ki jati santulan banaae rakhane ke liye vah bhujabal ko na hataae, par rakanpa nahin maani
 Pranab Mukherjee told the media that some 'facts and assumptions' are the reason for Ashok's resignation
 yah vajah he to teen anya mukhyamantri bhi apni kursiyon par pahalu badal rahe hai
 There is a buzz in the capital that the next phase is going to fall on Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit
 par yah charchaa itane lambey samay se he ki ab in baton par logon ko bharosa nahin rahaa he
 Congress legislators say that in prioritizing projects in the Commonwealth Games, he preferred his son Sandeep's constituency East Delhi
 rashtramandal khelon se jude ghotaalon kii jaanch kar rahi ve

 shungalu samiti apni report janvari tak saunp degi
 Suresh Kalmadi claims, the sludge that was being thrown at him will be hit by the Delhi government
 isse shila ke virodhiyon ko bal mila he
 But it does not seem that the Congress will sacrifice two chief ministers on corruption charges
 ashok ko hataanaa hi kadava ghunt tha
 Apparently, this brought relief to Sheela
 udhar, andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke
 Rosaiah can be sent to Raj Bhavan
 kharaab swasthya or mahatvakankshi jagmohan reddy se pareshaan 77 varshiya mukhyamantri kii pakad rajya main dhili pad rahi he
 His recent comment that he became chief minister 'by mistake or misfortune' gives a glimpse of his insecurity
 sonia dilli se koi netaa thopakar andhra pradesh main bhi maharashtra model apnaane kii soch rahi he
 Those leaders may also be Union Minister Jaipal Reddy
 congress kii ranneetih chunki vah alag telugana rajya nahin bana sakati, isliye sabase acha vikalp yah he ki telugana ke hi kisi aadmi ko puraa andhra pradesh de diya jaae
 There are elections in Assam next year, and there is little chance that Tarun Gogoi, who won twice, will be able to form a trio
 74 varsh kii umr main ve rahul kii yuva congress kii soch main feet nahin baithte
 There is also a complaint that they are not tightening their ministers who are accused of transferring the funds given for development in southern Assam to a militant organization
 par congress main unka vikalp na hone se gogoi ko doosraa mauka diya ja saktaa he
 Congress's ally Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah is increasingly realizing that inheritance is a double-edged sword
 haal hi main unki party par dabaav tha ki centre main unke pita faruk abdulla or unke bich adla-badali kar di jaae
 If the regime stumbles again, the Center will be forced to impose President's Rule
 badtar sthiti main congress ko umr ke kattar virdohi mufti mohammad said se gathjod karnaa pad saktaa he
 In September, Sonia resumed talks with the Mufti
 umr jaanate hai ki congress kaa samarthan milane kii ekmaatr vajah rahul hai
 But Ashok can tell them that it is not enough

 s
 yeddiurppa ko lekar chintaaen hai jinke khilaaf reddy bandhuon or rajya ke taqatvar netaa anant kumaar ne vidroh kar rakhaa he
 During the recent trust vote, he was able to save his chair with great difficulty
 maharashtra main ashok ko hataae jane ke kuch hi ghante baad chaar asantusht bhaajapa vidhayakon ne yeddiurppa ko bhrashtachar ke aaropon par hataane kii maang kar di
 The BJP is looking to replace them, as it is its first government in the South
 choti-si avadhi main hi uski sarkaar par ghotaalon or bhrashtachar ke aarope lagate rahe hai

 Gauri saw a man crossing the road and tears came out of his eyes
 ve unke pita the, jinako unhone pichley 15 saal se nahin dekha tha
 "today i can sit next to the Prime Minister and talk about being transgender (eunuch), but i still don't have the courage to voice my father," says Gauri

 Team Anna has said that if the government fails to pass the influential Lokpal Bill in the winter session of Parliament, then agitation against UPA will be started in all the states including Uttar Pradesh where elections are going to be held
 team anna sadsy manish sitaudiya ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘yadi samprag sarkaar sansad main lokapal vidheyak laane main asafal rahati he yaa yah apeksha ke anuroop nahin rahata he to anna or unke samarthak uttar pradesh samet sabhi rajyon main samprag virdohi andolan chhedenge, jahaan agle saal vidhansabha chunaav hona he
 'sisodia came to participate in a two-day workshop conducted by Team Anna
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki yadi anna ko kisi party kaa samarthan karnaa hoga to vah khulkar karenge
 He said that if a party wants to use his image to capitalize on Anna's popularity, people are also very intelligent
 sitaudiya ne kaha, ‘chalbaasiyon se lambey samay tak vot nahin praapt kiya ja saktaa
 ' chakravaati tufaan varada ne tamilnadu or andhra pradesh main tabaahi machaana shuru kar diya he
 This storm can be somewhat vulnerable during landfall
 lekin tufaan ke chalate tej hawaaon ke saath baari barish kaa daur agle 36 ghante tak jari rahegi
 This year 'varada' is the third cyclonic storm to develop in the Bay of Bengal after 'kyant' and 'nada' during the north-east Monsoon
 bengal kii khadi se uthe is tufaan ko pakistan ne ek phool kaa naam diya he
 The word 'varada' means 'red rose' in Arabic or Urdu
 pakistan kii ore se isse pehle samudri tufaanon ke naam phanus, naragis, laila or nilophar rakhe gaye the jabaki varada ke baad vaale tufaanon ke naam titali or bulbul hai
 In this way, Pakistan names cyclone after women
 harrican, typhun or cychlonpahale chakravaaton ke naam nahin rakhe jate the
 The tradition of naming them began with cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean
 jab hawa kii speed kam se kam 63 kilometre prati ghante ho jaati he or yah kuch der barkaraar rahati he to 3 minute ke bheetar ye chakravaati tufaan kaa rup dhaaran kar leti he
 Cyclonic storms with speeds up to 74 mph are classified as hurricanes, typhoons, or cyclones
 chakravaati tufaanon ko naam die jate hai or agar ye harrican, typhun yaa cyclone ke taur develop hote hai to inke naam barkaraar rahete hai
 Hurricane, Typhoon or Cyclone - they are all the same
 duniya ke alag-alag hisson main inke naam badal jate hai
 Like in the Atlantic they are called Hurricanes, Typhoon in Pacific Ocean and Cyclone in Indian Ocean
 tufaanon ke namakaran kii kahanialantic main uthne vaale tufaanon ko naam dene kii parampara kuch saikadon varshon se shuru hui he
 Initially, people living in the Caribbean islands named the storm after a saint
 yani roman catholic calendar ke mutabik jis din koi tufaan shuru hota tha, us din ke sant ke naam par tufaan kaa naam rakhaa jaataa tha
 This tradition lasted until the second world war when meteorologists started naming storms after women
 1953 main america mausam vibhaag ne Q, U, X, y or z ko chhodkar a se w tak padane vaale mahilaon ke naam ko tufaanon ke naam rakhane ke idia ko aupchaarik taur par sweekaar kar liya
 However, in the 60s and 70s, a number of women's organizations opposed it, following which the tradition of including men's names in the names of storms started in 1978
 us varsh pehle chakravaati tufaan kaa naam "A" akshar se shuru hua, duusare tufaan kaa naam "B" akshar se shuru hua or isi tarah alphabet ke aadhaar par namakaran shuru hua
 In even-numbered years, odd-numbered storms were named males, while females with odd-numbered years were named
 kaise rakhe jate hai inke naamatuphani chakravaaton kaa namakaran vishwa mausam sanghathan ke tatwadhan main tamaam chetavanee kendron kii ore se kiya jaataa he
 This facilitates communication to the Meteorological Department and general public regarding weather forecasts, warnings etc
 in tufaanon ke naam ke liye aath list hai jinhen kram ke hisaab se istemaal kiya jaataa he or ye har kuch saal par rotate nahin hote
 The names of some cyclonic storms have also retired
 duniya main tufaani chakravaaton kaa namakaran hind mahaasaagar ke alaava, australian rigen, atlantic, eastern, central, western or dakshini prashanth basin bhi karte hai
 Cyclonic storms in the northern Indian Ocean are named by the Indian Meteorological Department
 hind mahaasaagar main padane vaale bharat, pakistan, bangladesh, maldive, myanmar, oman, srilanka or thailand in tufaanon ke namakaran main yogadan karte hai
 There is a list of 64 names of such storm cyclones
 is list ke mutabik kyant ke namakaran main myanmar kaa or nadaa ke namakaran main oman kaa yogadan rahaa
 Kyant means 'gharial' and 'nada' and means 'nothing'
 ritair bhi hote hai tufaanon ke namkuch tufaanon ke naam baad main istemaal nahin kiye jate jinase janmaal kaa bade paimaane par nuksaan hota he
 Even if their name has to be used, at least after 10 years
 in naamon kii jagah nae naam rakhe jate hai
 These names are retired in honor of those killed in the storm
 ek baar naam aupchaarik taur par ritair ho jaataa he to isaki jagah usee ling or usee akshar se shuru hone vaala naam rakhaa jaataa he
 Since 1972, more than 50 names have been retired

 agar aap rojaanaa offis jaakar thak gaye hai or chhuttiyaan lekar relax karnaa chaahate hai, lekin samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki aisa kya bahaanaa banaaen ki bos chuttee dene ke liye raji ho jaaen to follow karen ye tips
 Believe me these excuses will definitely work once
 1
 Reason: Do not say not to work: Today i do not feel like working
 kya kahen:main offis kii salanaa report par kaam kar rahaa tha
 In the office, the boss wants to see your passion and intention for work, if you are serious about your work then someday this excuse can come in handy
 2
 Reason: Do not say traffic: Even the time taken for commuting should be included in the office hours
 kya kahen:kisi dharne / tyohaar / bheed ke jam kaa bahaanaa kiijie, jo hamaare desh main aam baat he
 Traffic is a big problem in the country, they all know that in such a situation, the boss will find something real
 jab bos kaa chillaanaa ban jaae daily routine, to yun rakhen khud ko kool3
 Reason: Personal problem
 Say no: My hair was wet or my shirt was not press
 kya kahen:meri family member yaa paaltu jaanavar ko doctor ke paas le janaa tha
 Make an excuse for a household member or pet
 bos kaa dil pigal jayega
 4
 kaaran:ghar kaa jaruri kamakya naa kahen:mere ghar main aag lag gai thi
 What to say: The water tank started leaking as soon as the mechanic left
 mechainic yaa naukaraani bhi aapke liye behatar dost sabit ho sakate hai
 Just try to use his name once in the office
 Warning: job intervyuu ke dauraan karte hai ye 2 galtiyaan to sanbhal jaaen5
 Reason: Don't let the alarm go bad: Say these days because of the Olympics, i reset my watch according to foreign time
 kya kahen:bijli na hone ke kaaran meri digital ghadi ne kaam karnaa band kar diya tha, so vakt par alarm nahin baja
 The excuse of electricity is also a good idea to escape
 maheene main ek baar to ise istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 6
 kaaran:chaabi kho janakya naa kahen:meri patni ne majaak main chaabi chhipaakar rakh di
 What to say: My wife mistakenly took the keys of my car with her
 shaq or aarope aapako offis main kai baar bachaa sakate hai
 Bosses get caught up in the stories they create
 nai naukari jwine karne se pehle HR se puch len ye 6 jaruri sawaal7
 Reason: Don't let the car go bad: Say the bees had made a hive on my car
 kya kahen:meri car kaa tair pankchar ho gaya tha
 Car breakdown is a simple excuse

 (with IANS input) aitihaasik faislon ke lihaaj se yah haftaa behad khaas rahaa kyonki pichley 2 dinon mensupreme courtne kai ahm vishyon par apana supreme faisla sunaaya
 The country's largest court is now going to pronounce its verdict on the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple on Friday
 patthanmathitta jile ke pashchimi ghat kii pahari par sthit sabarimala mandir prabandhan ne supreme court ko bataaya tha ki 10 se 50 varsh kii aayu tak kii mahilaon ke pravesh par isliye pratibandh lagaaya gaya he kyonki masik dharm ke samay ve shuddhta banaae nahin rakh saktin
 There has been a long-standing demand for the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple, which the temple management has consistently opposed
 entry ko lekar maamla supreme court main pahunchaa
 The 5-member bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misraki reserved the verdict after a full hearing in August
 is maamle main 7 november, 2016 kokeralasarkaar ne court ko suchit kiya tha ki vahaitihaasik sabarimala mandirmen sabhi aayu varg kii mahilaon ke pravesh ke paksh main he
 Initially, the then LDF government of the state adopted a progressive stance in 2007 to support the entry of women into the temple which was replaced by the Congress-led UDF government
 udief sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki vah 10 se 50 aayu varg kii mahilaon kaa pravesh varjit karne ke paksh main he kyonki yah parpanra ati pracheen kaal se chali aa rahi he
 Later, the Kerala government once again agreed on the entry of women into the temple, placing its stand in the Supreme Court
 rajya sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki sarkaar har umr kii mahilaon ke pravesh ke samarthan main he
 Then, on this stand of the state government, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra had raised the question and said that you changed the stand for the fourth time
 justise rohington ne kaha ki kerala vakt ke saath badal rahaa he
 In 2015 the Kerala government supported the entry of women, but in 2017 it changed its stand
 jiske baad ab phir usne pravesh dene par sahmati jataai
 In July, during the hearing of a PIL on the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple, the Travancore Devasam Board argued that the entry of women into mosques was banned
 tab sirf ek janhit yachika ke aadhaar par bina kisi thos daleel ke sirf mandir maamle par hi sunwaayee kyon ho rahi he kyonki samanta ke adhikaar ke ulanghan kaa maamla masjidon par bhi lagu hota he
 Then, with the plea of travancore Devasam Board lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, there was a new twist in the ban on the entry of women in Ayyappa Swamy temple of Sabarimala being heard in the Supreme Court
 travnakor devasam board kii taraf se kaha gaya ki rajaswala avasthaa ke dauraan mahilaon kii baat to dur, kai masjidon main bhi to mahilaon ko jane kii ijaajat bhi nahin he
 While hearing, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra has asked the Travancore Devasam Board to prove to the Board that this ban is an integral part of the religious faith
 saath hi usne yah bhi poocha ki kya sirf rajaswala avasthaa kii vajah se mahilaayein malin ho jaati hai? lihaaja mahilaon ke mandir main daakhile par hi pabandi laga dena unke sanvaidhanik adhikaron or garima ke khilaaf he
 Taking a dig at the Board, the Supreme Court also asked that in the Kerala High Court it was said that the temple of Lord Ayyappa of Sabarimala is allowed to enter the women in the first 5 days of the annual festival
 masalan koi pabandi nahin
 So why are contradictory statements being made here? chalis dinon tak chali thi ayodhya maamle kii sunwaayeepanch jajon kii bench shanivaar ko sunaaya faislasupreme court main aitihaasik ram janmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad par faisla aa gaya he

 There was a fierce commotion at the Gardenia Glory Society of Sector 46 in Noida, adjacent to Delhi
 yahaan ke ek nivasee ne nashe main dhut hokar kareeb 15 gadiyon ke shishe tod die
 All these vehicles belonged to people living in the society
 darasal raat ko yahaan ke nivasee mukesh sharma kaa betaa nashe main jab socity ke get par pahunchaa to guard ne use duusare get se aane ke liye kaha
 Keeping in mind the security in the society at night, only one gate is allowed to go to and from the trains
 isliye guard ne niyam kaa paalan karne ke liye jab duusare get se aane ke liye car savaar ko kaha to usne guard se gaali-galoz kii or vahaan se apane ghar chalaa gaya
 'when the glass of 15 vehicles broke', when the young man reached home, the bouncers went there and talked to him, but there was also rage and beatings
 marpet ke baad nashe main dhut yuvak aag babula ho gaya or ghar se baahar nikalakar usne socity main khadi gadiyon ke shishe todna shuru kar diya
 Surprisingly, despite having so many guards and bouncers, the young man kept breaking the glass of vehicles
 guard se jab maamla nahin sanbhala to usne shishe tuutane vaali gadiyon ke maalikon ko isaki jaankaree di
 After this, the police reached there and the young man was taken into custody
 ye puri ghatana raat kareeb 1 ke baad hui
 Some people living in the society say that the youth always keeps doing such activities and once the guard has stopped, he has also hit him
 log usapar beeti raat guard ko bhi peetane kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 The people of the society say that they are already living in a society equipped with half incomplete facilities and despite paying a heavy maintenance charge, their security is God trust
 yahaan ke ek nivasee ne bataaya ki unki basament parking main khadi car kaa sheesha kisi ne tod diya tha or yahaan kii mentanence agency ne na to koi harjaana diya or na hi kisi tarah kii jimmedaari lee

 yahaan ke gym or club main bhi bahari logon kaa jamaavada laga rahata he
 So far the maintenance is in the hands of the builder here and people allege that despite complaining to the builder many times no action was taken
 yahaan par ajanabi log sharaab pikar ghoomte rahete hai or tokane par dhamkee dena yaa gaali galoz karnaa aam baat he

 Hockey India has said that the Supreme Court's flagging of its elections is a slap in the face of those who were constantly creating problems in organizing these much-awaited elections
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne bombai or dilli ucch nyaayalay ke faislon par roak lagaate hue haaki india ko chunaav karaane kii sweekruti de di, jo buudhvaar ko chauthi baar sthagit hue the
 However, the Supreme Court asked the National Federation not to implement the results
 haaki india ke adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘hamen pataa tha ki sthagan aadesh par roak laga di jaaegi
 This was bound to happen
 yah un logon ko makul jawub he jo nahin chaahate the ki chunaav hon
 "but it is our responsibility to hold elections as soon as possible, otherwise India will be under threat of international Hockey Federation ban," he said
 ’’ adhikari ne kaha ki gatirodhon se bachane ke liye haaki india ab jald se jald chunaav karaayega
 He said, "there will be elections
 ab ham rajya ikaayiyon ke sabhi pratinidhiyon ko suchit karenge
 We hope to do this in four to five days because we will have to make all the arrangements once again
 ’’ There's a lot of other stuff our ancestors did or had to do, like child marriage, Sati etc
 So, should we get back to that as well? Just asking, because apparently that's also connected to our roots
 @sabya_mukherjee, what a male chauvinistic statement to make, least expected from an educated man like you

 After changing the names of many cities of the country, the matter has now reached Indore in Madhya Pradesh
 indore ke naam main parivartan kii bahes bhi shuru ho gai he
 In this regard, a proposal was presented in the conference of municipal councilors, in which the name of Madhya Pradesh's economic capital was changed to 'indur'
 nagar nigam ke sabhapati ajay singh naruka ne bataaya ki bijepi parshad sudhir dedge ne aitihaasik tathyon kaa hawala dete hue is baithak main kaha ki indore kaa mul naam 'indur' he
 Therefore the city should be addressed by this name
 is prastaav ke baad dedge se kaha gaya he ki vah apane daawey ke samarthan menaitihaasik dastavespesh karen
 After this, due consideration will be taken on their proposal
 dedge ne bataaya,'pracheen indreshwar mahadev mandirke kaaran is shahar kaa naam indur rakhaa gaya tha
 But due to incorrect pronunciation of British, the name of the city changed to Indore, which was later changed to Indore
 ' unhone kaha ki indore purv holkar shaskaon kii rajdhani rahaa he or riyasat kaal ke kai aitihaasik dastavejon main bhi is shahar ko 'indur' hi bataaya gaya he
 In the by-elections held in Uttar Pradesh's Kairana Lok Sabha and Noorpur assembly seats, all the bjp's bets failed
 bijepi ne jinna ke mudde ko uthaaya lekin ganna haaavee rahaa
 The Yogi government announced the removal of the case against the accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots, but the heart of the Jat community still did not budge
 isi kaa nateeja he ki bijepi apni donon siten bachaane main safal nahin ho saki
 bjp's stronghold Nurpur collapsed, SP managed to open account on this seat for the first time
 sapa ke naimul hasan ne bijepi kii ummidavaar avani singh ko 6211 maton se maat dekar kabja jamaaya
 Jinnah could not come in the midst of the announcement of bjp's Kamkairana and Nurpur by-elections, there was a ruckus on the letter written by BJP MP on Jinnah's picture in Aligarh Muslim University in Western UP
 bijepi netaa jinna mudda ko hawa dene main jute the
 According to political pundits, Jinnah was trying to spread the bjp's polarization on the pretext of the issue, but she could not succeed in her plans
 jabaki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mujffarnagar danga or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main kabristaan-shmashaan ke mudde ke bahaane bijepi dhruvikaran karne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 But this bet of BJP could not be done in the by-election
 isi kaa nateeja he ki kairana or nurpur main karaari haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 Sugarcane dominates over Jinnah, non-payment of sugarcane to farmers by sugar mills in Kairana was a big issue
 18 may tak chini mil companiyon ne kul 1778
 Has purchased sugarcane worth Rs 49 crores
 ye ganna 315-325 rupee prati quintal ke daam se kharida gaya, is sijan main kisaanon ko bhugtan ke taur par ek paisa bhi nahin mila he
 West UP is called the sugarcane belt
 kisaanon kii mukhya upaj ganna he or unhen bhugtan na hone se sarkaar ke khilaaf naaraazgi thi
 Six Chinese have been found in Kairana
 chaar milon kii maalik nijee companiyaan hai
 There are two in the cooperative sector
 upachunaav ko dekhte hue yogi sarkaar ne privet kshetra vaali chini milon par dabaav daalaa ki ve puure kshetra ke kisaanon kaa ganna len
 But the farmers were unhappy with the non-payment of sugarcane

 Due to this, Yogi and PM Modi said that sugarcane farmers will be paid in 14 days
 sarkaar ke is vaade par kairana ke log vishwaas nahin kiye
 The result of this is that the BJP had to be defeated
 dangon par bantwaare kaa daanv felbijepi ne upachunaav se pehle jat samudaay ko apane saath jode rakhane ke liye bada daanv chalaa
 On behalf of the Yogi government, the accused of the Muzaffarnagar riots were asked to remove the case from above
 iske alaava bijepi kii ore se mujffarnagar danga peediton ke campon ke paas piesi camp sthapit karaane kii baat bhi kahi gai thi
 The stakes of constant polarization being tried by the party failed
 jat samudaay ne bijepi par bharosa jataane ke bajaae areldi kii muslim ummidavaar par bharosa jataayaa
 Kairana's election results have ruled out riot-splitting politics
 udyog mandal asocham ne vibhinn kshetron main naveen khoj ko sangrakshan uplabdh karaane ke liye jugad praudyogiki kaa patent karaae jane kii apil kii he
 The utility model is a patent-like intellectual property right, but typically requires less strict rules for a short period of six to 15 years
 udyog mandal ne kaha ki china, france or germany samet kareeb 48 desh is model ko apana rahe hai
 Assocham said that such indigenously made tractors need to be protected, which cost one third of the cost of branded tractors

 praant ke kuch adhikari or ecadmik china main uigharon ke itihaas, vahaan par aatankwaad, is praant kii aarthik uplabdhiyaan or sambhaavnaaen, silk root or kis tarah china main aatankwaad, antarrashtriya aatankwaad kaa hissaa he, ye sab bataate rahe
 Their main purpose was to convince me that the Xinjiang province is suffering from terrorism, the action that has been taken on Uighur Muslims in China is not only in the interest of China but also in the world
 haa, in lacture main aatankwaadiyon ko ek alag naam se kai baar bulaayaa gaya- shaitani takat!pehle din ke lacture ke baad patrakaron ko uramuchi ke musium le jaaya gaya
 Some pictures of Uygars and other minority culture were shown along with the Chinese heritage
 aglaa padaav tha ek agzebishan
 This particular exhibition is not for the common people
 yahaan hamaare jaise shinjiyang pahunche patrkaar or chini adhikari hi laae jate hai
 The place has large stock of photographs, dates, and seized weapons of the terrorist attacks in Xinjiang province
 maine washington ke newzium main FBI vaala hissaa bhi dekha he jahaan america main hue aatanki hamale or unki jaanch se jude saamaan rakhe hai
 But this exhibition of Urmuchi is different
 jahaan washington main aap ek bhi aisi tasviir nahin dekhenge jisamen insaani sharir ke chithde ude hue hon, buree tarah ghayal-lahooluhaan ho, uramuchi main ye sab kuch he
 These are shivering, disturbing pictures
 kareeb 47 aise hamalon kii tasviren yahaan par hai
 There is also some CCTV footage of attacks with sharp weapons on the streets
 adhikariyon ke mutabik aise kai or hamale hue hai
 Their direct purpose is to tell the magnitude of the attacks
 lekin aaj jab duniya ke kisi bhi kone kii tasviir har us shaks ke paas uplabdh he jiske paas internet he, tab in tasveeron ko aise pesh karne kaa matlab aakhir kya ho saktaa he
 Perhaps all of this meant giving a context to the vocational training centers that the world is referring to as concentration camps
 in pehle dinon main sabhi patrakaron ko us islamic training institute bhi le jaaya gaya jahaan uighar imaamon ko sarkari kharche par training, rahane kii suvidha or masik bhatta diya jaataa he
 The principals tie the bridge to the government's praise
 ham urumachi ke saanskrithik centre bhi gaye jahaan par paaramparik uighar nrity sangeet kii ek jhalak mili
 
 
 But all these are the curtains of the story that is being made in China's 'vocational Training Center'

 Due to heavy rains in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh, the water in a water fall increased very fast

 Almost all the rivers are in spate due to heavy rains in Madhya Pradesh

 Life and death
 donon qudarat kii wo sachai hai jinhen jhuthlaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 Life changes into death and death into life
 sabko lagata he ki ham pahaad kabhi nahin marate
 But this is a lie
 ham bhi marate hai
 Just in our entire life, many generations do not even see humans
 bas use lagata he ki ham marate hi nahin
 
 ek saal pehle kedarnath main ai tabaahi ke nishaan aaj bhi kedarnath or uske aas-paas ke jangalon main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Due to this catastrophe, the devotees formed a relationship of faith and pain with God and his abode
 logon ke dard kii kahaniyaan to aapane bahut dekhi or suni lekin kabhi unke dard ko bhi suna jo sadiyon se jindagi kaa ye tamaasha dekh rahe hai
 He is the oldest witness of this period
 sab pani pani ho gaya
 
 
 All water became water on seeing it
 hotel
 Inn
 loj
 Dharamshalas
 sadaken
 Shops
 yani jinke sahare zindagi qudarat ko qareeb se dekhne kaa hausala kar paati he
 All those support
 pani-pani ho gaye
 Those who were in Kedarnath before June 16 and are still alive today
 wo sab ke sab hairat main hai ki achaanak ye kya ho gaya
 The mountains crack
 zamin kaa khisakna
 Cloudburst
 ye wo haadase hai jo uttarkashi ke daaman main hameshaa se hoti ai hai
 There was nothing new in this
 koi nai baat nahin he inamen
 But such a loss of life and property? Chaman in a moment
 viraan ho gaya
 It was read in the stories of the religious world
 nadiyon ne insaan ko sikhaaya sabatchanak garmi se tapate desh main monsoon ne is baar 13 din pehle hi dastak de di thi
 Seeing this rain of relief turned into a disaster
 uttarakhand ke daaman main bahane vaali alaknanda kii sabhi saheliyaan bhagirathi, dhauli, pinder, mandakini, vishnuganga ne achaanak us insaan ko chunauti dene kii thaan lee jo ghamandi ho chukaa he
 Which it seems that even the days and nights of nature are enslaved by its governments
 mausam uske hi adhyadeshon kaa paalan karte hai
 The sun, the moon, the clouds, the winds all move before the Prime Minister, the Chief Minister, Chief Engineer and the government babu, and feed some unbridled contractors before they go ahead
 par is baar achaanak in nadiyon ne faisalaa kar liya ki vah tarakkee ke naam par kii ja rahi is gaiyrkanoonee chhedchhad se apni zamin ko paak karenge
 And then nature began to clear its bowels
 kedarnath ke mukhya hisse jisamen sadiyon purana gumbad bhi he ko chhodkar sara kachra saafe kar diya
 a large part of Gaurikund town and Rambara, where haphazard man-made buildings and markets had grown, erased the traces
 yahi haal sonprayag, chandripur or badrinaath kaa hua
 This orgy of swollen rivers submerged many parts of Uttarakhand, Himachal, Uttar Pradesh, in which hundreds of people lost their lives
 vikaas ke naam par jis tarah zidagi dene vaali in nadiyon ko baandha ja rahaa he, jis tarah in pahaado main, jinase lipatakar ye nadiyaan maidan par utarati hai, in bhigirathi jataaon main, send lagaakar anginat surange khodi ja rahi hai, unke kilaaf qudarat kaa ye gussa bhi he or chetavanee bhi
 Indiscriminate digging and buying of land in Uttarakhand In the last thirty years, ever since Uttarakhand became a state, all kinds of shops have opened up in the name of development and tourism
 manamaane tareeke se yahaan zamin kii kareed-farokht ho rahi he
 Indiscriminate digging is underway
 bijli ke naam par jagah jagah dam banaakar nadiyon ko baandha ja rahaa he
 Ancient settlements like Tehri were accepted for development
 nateeja saamne he
 That is, the sky was definitely havoc, but the foundation was laid by humans only
 haalanki ab bhi aksar aise log mil jate hai jinhen hamaari qadra he
 Who understand our tongue
 hamaare jazbaat samajhate hai
 But their number is becoming very less
 ungaliyon par gine ja sakate hai aise log
 The rest gets wrapped up in our bodies like leech
 or hamaara koon tab tak chuusate rahete rahete
 till then
 jab tak unke pet fat nahin jate
 How much everything has changed
 ham inhen hairat se dekhte rahete hai
 Their ancestors
 hamen maathe se lagaate the
 Those people understood our importance
 pathar ko devtaa samajhate the wo log
 They knew that we are the keepers of living beings
 ham bhi unki tazim karte the
 Sheesh used to greet him
 lekin hamane dekha ki dhire-dhire unki auladon main badlaav aane laga
 We know that change happens
 hamaare andar bhi parivartan hota he
 Everything in nature changes
 yahaan tak kii reeti-rivaajon main, manyataon main, sochane ke andaaz main
 Every bed changes
 ye badlaav kabhi maut kaa mazaa detaa he
 Ever bitterness of life par bahut halke halke hota he ye badlaav
 As the day slowly goes into the fire of the night
 jaise raat subah ko jagaati he
 And covering itself, it hides somewhere under the pillow
 insaan kii nai aulaaden sab jatke main badalanaa chaahati hai
 
 
 But these new humans want to change everything in a jolt
 or ye jatke hamaare shant swabhaav ko bahut zyaada zakhmi kar dete hai
 It seems as if the robber entered the house
 jinhen ghar ke logon se koi matlab na ho
 They have considered us dead
 jabaki sach ye he ki ye khud zindaa laashen ban chuke hai
 Their relationship with the land is broken
 hamaari nason par ye apni gaadiyaan itani tej daudaate hue udhar-udhar ghoomte rahete hai
 Don't know what kind of machines they have invented
 bas dil nahin he in mashiinon ke paas varanaa ye bhi inaki jaisi hi to hai
 By the way, those who have heart also have heart
 ab tak to aap samaj hi chuke honge ki ham kiske kii dard baat kar rahe he
 We are telling you about the mountains which have been witness to human greed for centuries
 jaise-jaise hamaari baat aage badhati gai unki awaz main dard or unka gussa dhire-dhire badhata gaya
 By the way, think that if the pain he got, he would have swamped the whole world
 brahmad ke buniya ke peeche he tarkais brahmad ko banane vaale ne jo kuch banaaya he uske peeche koi na koi tark zarur he
 He gave us treasures of water without which life on earth cannot be imagined
 hamaari unchaaiyon se lekar samandar kii gaharaai tak pani kaa ye safar puri dharti ko jivan kii saunaat baantta he
 But today's mad and educated man has turned away from this distinction of nature
 wo qudarat ko apana ghulaam bananaa chahta he
 He wants the wind to flow at his behest
 nadiyaan usase puch kar aage badhen
 The sea awaits his orders
 or ham pahaad
 Keep the hole in your body
 thaharnaa nadiyon ke mijaaz main nahin
 
 
 Now take these rivers only
 hamaari kokh se nikal kar inhen samandar tak janaa hota he
 And it is not in their nature to stay
 qudarat kii kaarigari main thaharne kii ijazat inhen he hi nahin
 They have to enter the sea
 lekin insaan ne
 Science of humans
 inase bijli banani sikh lee
 Stopping them further accelerated their speed
 insaan kii madad ke liye ek had tak in nadiyon ne uskaa saath diya
 But humans understood this help of rivers as his weakness
 bas yaheen bhul ho gai usase
 And the result of that mistake
 uttarkashi ke daaman main jo tabaahi
 You have seen the loss of life and property
 wo isi bhul kaa nateeja he
 And what was the result of all this
 achaanak hazaron bequsur log
 Always coming to our shelters with our beliefs
 darshan ko aane vaale
 Elevators
 mard aurat
 Children old
 jawan sab ek pal main laapata ho gayi
 Nature is forced to clear its path
 
 
 hamen pataa he tum insaanon kaa ek tabaqa ye kah rahaa he ki ye qudarat kaa qahar he
 Which is broken on the landowners
 lekin ham bataate hai
 Who has seen more than us? sadiyon kaa itihaas hamaare seene main darj he
 We say that we have never seen Kudrat wreaking havoc
 tabaahi machaate nahin dekha
 When a human being has profaned with nature
 abhadrata kii he tab tab qudarat ne apane gusse kaa halkaa sa namoona pesh kiya he
 That too for warning
 lekin tum insaan kahaan maanane vaale ho
 But remember
 ye qudarat
 This nature gives everything to live
 lekin jab insaan uskaa rasta rokane kii koshish karata he to majabuuran use apana rasta saafe karnaa padataa he
 This destruction, this loss of life and property that you saw
 bhugta
 This is the smallest sample of the same anger of nature
 jo sirf ye kehane kii koshish kar rahaa he ki sanbhal jaao
 Come to your senses
 taaki tumhen vakt se pehle qayamat naa dekhni pade

 2 in the central government and close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and bjp's Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy, has now come to the fore
 zyaadaatar maamalon par sarkaar ke bachaav main utarane vaale arun jetali ke twit ne ye saaf kar diya ki swami ke saath wo aar-paar kii ladaai ke mood main hai
 Jaitley tweeted that 'unfair and false allegations are being made against a disciplined officer of the Ministry of Finance
 'twit waar main koode jetlidrasal jetali ko ye jawaab isliye dena padaa kyonki arabiai governor raghuram rajan or mukhya aarthik salahakar arvind subramanyam ke baad swami ne aarthik maamalon ke sachiv shaktikanta das par hamalaa bolaa
 Someone wrote on Twitter that Shaktikanta Das served the country a lot
 ab unhen waapas tamilnadu bhej dena chahie
 To this, Swami wrote that i think a case is pending against him
 jisamen unhone pi chidambaram ko mahabalipuram main ahm jagahon par jameen hathiyaane main madad kii thi
 Swamy is obviously going to open a front on the officials associated with the Finance Ministry
 vitt mantri ko nagavar gujara or wo bhi twitor war main kud pade
 After this whole issue, discussion starts within the BJP and the government as to why Subramaniam is in the mood to go directly with Arun Jaitley on the pretext of Swamy Finance Ministry
 aakhir jis mantri ko sarkaar or party main number 2 mana jaataa he uske khilaaf bolne par bhi swami par party chup kyon he?swami ke bijepi main shaamil hone kaa jetali ne kiya virohis kahani kii shuruyaat tab hui jab swami ko bijepi ne party main shaamil karne kaa man banaaya jiskaa arun jetali ne khulkar virodh kiya
 If sources are to be believed, the RSS had a full vote in favor of Swamy as not only did Swami Ram advocate on the temple issue but it was also a reason to open a front against the Gandhi family
 kahani tab dilachasp hui jab sarkaar main ek varisht mantri ne arun jetali ke naa chaahate hue bhi swami kaa samarthan karnaa shuru kiya
 Even before Swamy, an opinion was sought from Jaitley on making him a Rajya Sabha MP, which Jaitley opposed
 jetali ne yah kahkar swami ko bijepi seat par rajyasabha main bhejne se inkaar kiya ki swami ke bol rojaanaa sarkaar ko mushkil main daalenge
 The party and the government will have to clarify their statements
 raajnneeti main dushman kaa dushman dost hota he
 The same happened in BJP
 party or sarkaar main jetali virodhiyon ne swami kaa khulkar samarthan kiya or aaj naubat ye he ki vitt mantri hone ke naate jetali apane mantralay ke afasaron ke bachaav main akele utre hue hai
 Whether the party or the Sangh is watching the game silently
 sutro ke mutabik sangh ne swami banaam jetali kii is ladaai ko thanda karne ke liye grih mantri rajnath singh koswami se batakarne ko kaha tha jiske baad buudhvaar ko swami ne rajnath ke ghar jaakar unase mulaakaat bhi kii
 Swami is also considered close to Rajnath, but on Thursday morning, Swamy again made it clear by tweeting one after the other on the issue that he was not going to convince anyone
 PM modi ko todani hogi chuppiphilhal arun jetali ke jawaab se ye saaf he ki ab donon ke bich kii ye ladaai us mukaam par aa gai he jisame party or pradhanmantri zyada din chup nahin rah paaenge
 Because before the opposition, Arun Jaitley himself will definitely ask for this answer, after all, on whose instigation Swamy is doing all this
 arvind kejariwal ke anshan kaa aaj aathvaan din hai
 According to Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia, Kejriwal's health is constantly deteriorating
 duusari ore upwas par baithe arvind kejariwal ko samarthan badhata ja rahaa he
 So far, five lakh eleven thousand people have supported him on the issue of increased electricity bill
 isse pehle shuukravaar ko kejariwal se milane anna hajaare pahunche
 Anna reached the stage and praised Arvind's efforts and said that after a few days he should give up his fast because the government wants us to die
 lekin hamen maranaa nahin he, ladaai jari rakhni he
 Anna said that Arvind and his path may be different but the destination is same
 arvind kii sehat ke bare main bolte hue anna hajaare ne kaha ki arvind ko dubaara swasth hokar ladaai jari rakhni he or wo arvind ke saath hai
 Anna also said that Arvind is fighting for the poor
 aam logon ke liye lard rahe hai
 Anna arrived after 10 pm to meet Kejriwal
 duniya kaa sabase bada soshal network chalaane vaali company fasebuk ek nai digital karency lekar aane vaali he
 Last week, the company announced a new currency called Libra
 fasebuk kii is yojana kii bhanak takreeban ek saal pehle lag chuki thi jab usne fasebuk massenger ke mukhiya david marks ko blockchen project main laga diya tha
 Various speculations began to take place around this project worldwide
 lekin un saare kayaason par pichley hafte mangalvaar ko viraam lag gaya jab fasebuk ne kaha ki vah sasti karency laanch karne ja rahaa he jisase bahut saste main or aasaani se desh videsh main paisa bheja ja saktaa he
 Libra will neither be fully cryptocurrency like Bitcoin nor will it function like existing banks
 shuruyaat main yah in donon kaa milajula rup hoga
 Facebook claims that it can transact money from the business world to the common man in an easy and safe manner
 iske liye na to bank kii jarurat hogi or nahi bichauliyon kii
 Currently, on sending money abroad, on an average seven per cent of the amount is charged by banks and companies acting as middlemen in the name of service charge
 sarvice charge kaa yah dhandha takareeb 50 arab dollar kaa he
 Banks and other financial institutions already engaged in this business fear that the libra may not drive them out
 haalanki libra abhi launch nahin hui he or uske aane kii soochna bhar se duniya bhar ke bank regulator or sarkarein shaq kii nigaah se dekhne lagi hai
 It will not be easy for Facebook to run its coin around the world
 haalanki agle saal launch hone vaale libra ne cross border lenden ke kul 613 billian dollar ko torget kiya he
 Facebook is not alone in this plan to issue digital notes
 visa or ubar sahit kareeb 27 badi companiyaan fasebuk ke saath is bade global pement system main saath khadi hai
 Every company is investing at least 10 million dollars
 nai karency kii dekharekh switzraland sthit ek non profit sanstha libra association kar rahi he
 Facebook has not only launched currency but has also announced the launch of an electronic wallet (wallet) calibra
 libra ke liye kai aise batue honge unamem se ek fasebuk kaa calebra bhi hoga
 Libra is not a crypto currency
 Libra is not a crypto currency because some people will control it
 jabaki krypto main aisa koi system nahin hota
 She is completely decontaminated
 krypto karency se isaki samanta or maujuuda system se alag karne vaali keval ek cheez he or wo he blockchen yani electronic bahi-khaataa
 Blockchain is a kind of technology, it is a platform where digital currency or any thing can be digitally kept and recorded
 yani blockchaiyn ek digital lager he
 At the same time, Bitcoin and Libra is a digital medium, through which anything can be bought or sold
 blockchen 2008 main dizin kiya gaya tha
 Each block was fixed at one megabyte
 ab lenden kii gati badhaane vaali takanic kaa intjaar ho rahaa he
 Explaining the speedblockchain technology of transactions, Sanjay Sharma says, "bitcoin can do only seven transactions per second
 isaki tulana main libra prati second 1000 lenden kar saktaa he
 During this time the value of bitcoin decreases exponentially, but the libra can hold its value steady with a strong hold
 libra kaa makasad he ki public ise sweekaare
 Libra's focus for this is mainly on competitive transaction fees and fixed prices
 "sau se zyada nijee companiyaanis pement system main fasebuk akelaa nahin hoga
 There will be more than a hundred private players including Visa, Uber who will monitor this system
 philhal inaki sankhya kareeb 27 he, lekin ise sau tak le jane kii yojana he
 At the moment Libra has not found any legal basis nor the support of governments
 aise main is nai digital karency kii raah aasaan nahin hogi

 In this battle, 21 Sikh soldiers of the British Indian Army had to fight against the Afghan army of 10 thousand
 ye sawaal khud se kiijie
 What first came to your mind was when you came to know that the man from the state of Kusundhara was killed in a crowded crowd in protest of Kejriwal in Delhi
 dekh lijiye ham jagahon ko bhi raajnneeti se jod pahachaanate hai or marane vaale ko bhi
 Did you do the same? Or did you not think that problems of such and such will increase, but do not raise your finger on the lid? If so, something is dying inside you
 wo chhodiye gussa aayaa tha? jaij he
 Nobody can run away from responsibility, anger is justified on those leaders, who instead were giving speeches to save a dying person
 us mukhyamantri se sawaal karne banate hai, jiske rajya kaa kisaan duusare rajya jakaratmahatyakar letaa he
 The anger is justified on the Prime Minister who is promising good days and farmers are dying as before
 police kii kaaryastylee par sawaal uthte hai, camera chamkaati media par bhi
 It is also fair to the leader who is saying that he is standing with the farmers, even though he never opened his mouth on the deaths in his government
 par kya gussa or shikaayatein hi kaaphi hai? khud se phir puuchhie, ye gussa kya aap tatasth hokar kar sakate hai? bina purvaagrah ke? ruchi ko kinare kar bina ye dekhe ki aapkaa chaheta aapke sawaalon ke saamne hai
 No one will get such an opportunity, but questions from themselves become necessary
 samay beetaa or baaten saamne ain
 It was not a farmer but a businessman, there were problems of household and family
 pehle chunaav lard chukaa tha, ghar par tivi par dekhne ko kah aayaa tha
 Listen to Ashutosh's statement, listen to Kejriwal's words, listen to the excuses of the Delhi Police and the Home Minister, listen to the Congress desperate to take advantage
 raajnneeti itani ghinauni kabhi na thi
 Do you feel disgusted by this? Thousands speak
 chaliye mana ki kisaan na tha, par marane vaala insaan to tha? raily main aam aadmi the, unke nishane par bhaajapai the, phir antyeshti main congressi ja pahunche
 Delhi was the police, there was media, there were speeches, there were cameras, there was the Ministry of Home Affairs, there was the Delhi government in front
 bayaan hai, aarope hai, bahaane hai, shikaayatein hai, bas doosraa insaan he, jo is sabaki bheed main kahin najar nahin aata, jo pehle ko bachaa letaa
 Question yourself, are you that other person? We have become accustomed to seeing deaths
 haadason ke video manoranjan kaa saadhan hai
 Pictures of corpses are taken by zooming
 hamane murdon ko bhi sahuuliyat ke hisaab se baantnaa shuru kar diya
 It is not a big deal to die, everyone dies
 maut ajooba nahin he
 Suicide is no longer a crime either
 bura hota he hamaare bheetar ke insaan kaa mar janaa, hamaari samvednaaon kaa mar janaa, haadason kaa hedline ban janaa, kisi kaa mare huon ke desh main mar janaa, hamaara khud ke sawaalon se bachanaa, ham hote to kya karte? ham kya kar rahe hai?

 Under the scheme of 'har Ghar Nal, Har Nal Jal', the Modi government's plan to deliver water across the country is revolutionary in itself
 bajet pesh karte hue vitt mantri ne kaha,' bharat main jal suraksha sunishchit karnaa or sabhi deshavaasiyon ke liye shuddh evam paryaapt jal uplabdh karana hamaari sarkari kii praathamikta he

 daliton ko jodne kaa prayaas karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ravivaar ko apni britain yatra ke sandarbh main kaha ki vah us dauraan vahaan sthit dow bhim raav ambedkar ke us makaan kaa ek smarak ke rup main vidhivat udghaatan karenge jisamen baba sahab kabhi rahaa karte the or jo ab bharat kii sampatti ban gaya he
 Underlining Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's contribution to the upliftment of Dalits, victims, backward classes, PM Modi said, 'I am very excited to visit Britain this time
 uskaa vishesh kaaran he
 a few weeks ago i went to lay the foundation stone of a grand memorial near Babasaheb Ambedkar's Chaitya Bhoomi in Mumbai and now the house in which Baba Saheb Ambedkar lived in London has become the property of India, to be duly inaugurated
 i am going ’akashwani par man kii baat kaarykram main apane sambodhan main pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘dalit ho, peedit hon, shoshit hon, vanchit hon, pichde hon, kathinaaiyon se jindagi gujaarne vaale kisi bhi bhartiya ke liye baba sahib ambedkar kaa yah bhawan is baat kii prerana detaa he ki agar ichha shakti prabal ho to sankaton ko paar karke bhi apane jivan ko aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he, shiksha praapt kii ja sakati he
 He said that people would feel that this is the place where Baba Saheb Ambedkar had done penance
 ‘bharat sarkaar or rajya sarkarein samaaj ke daliton ,adivaasiyon or pichde virgo ke honhaar bacchon ko chaatravrutti detii hai jo videsh padhane jate hai
 The Government of India also encourages promising Dalit youths

 The Kiwi team had to play the follow-up and in the second innings of New Zealand on the same day, Yasir took 10 wickets in one day with two wickets
 bharat ke anil kumble ne din main 10 wicket lene kaa record pakistan ke khilaaf 7 farvari 1999 ko banaaya tha
 He had done the feat of taking all 10 wickets in the Delhi Test
 yah alag baat he ki kumble ne jahaan ek hi pari main puure 10 wicket lene kii uplabdhi hasil kii thi, vahiin yasir shah (yasir Shah) ne pehali pari main 8 or duusari pari main 2 wicket lekar din main 10 wicket lene kii uplabdhi hasil kii thi
 Apart from Anil Kumble, Jim Laker of England has set a record of taking 10 wickets in a test innings

 uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti main tipu ke naam se mashhoor akhilesh yadav ne jis din se samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhyaksh kii kaman sanbhali he, tab se unke liye raajnneetik taur par koi acchhee khabar nahin ai he
 Akhilesh Yadav, who has placed his family at stake to dominate the party, is experimenting election-by-election, but none of his experiments have been successful
 maujuuda loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon se pehle aae agsit pole bhi akhilesh yadav ke sabase bade faisle ke asafal hone kii gavaahi de rahe hai
 In the exit poll of Aaj tak-axis My India, out of 80 seats in UP, the SP-BSP alliance is expected to get only 10-16 seats
 ye wo aakanda he jo na sirf bijepi virodhiyon ko pareshaan karne vaala he, balki khud akhilesh yadav ko sirdard dene vaala he
 More than this, this litmus test of Akhilesh Yadav's political understanding and decisions will also be considered
 kyonki apane dam par samaajawaadee party kii raajnneeti chamakaane vaale mulaayam singh yadav kii dhara se hatakar gathbandhan se satta ke sheersh tak pahunchane kii yojana banane vaale akhilesh yadav apane iraadon main kaamyaab nahin ho paae hai
 Alliance with Congress in 2017 Assembly Elections When Akhilesh Yadav became the Chief Minister of UP for the first time in 2012, he emphasized on development works and contested the slogans like 'vikas Bolta Hai' in the coming 2017 Assembly Elections
 itnaa hi nahin, chachaa shivpal yadav ko kinare rakh akhilesh yadav ne na sirf khud samaajawaadee party kii kaman apane haathon main le lee, balki bijepi or basapa ko chunauti dene ke liye rahul gandhi se haath bhi milaate hue upi ko ye saath pasand kaa he naaraa diya
 Both the boys of UP fought the assembly elections together but in the name of Modi, there was such an air of BJP that all the opponents collapsed
 lihaaja, sapa kii kaman milte hi akhilesh yadav kaa pehla raajnneetik nirnay fail ho gaya
 After the defeat of Akhilesh Yadav with Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav took a decision that no one had imagined
 bijepi ke khilaaf sapa-basapa or areldi milakar kairana, phulpur va gorakhpur loksabhaa siton par hue upachunaav main utre
 This formula went on and the BJP lost all three seats
 is jeet ne bijepi virdohi kheme main jaan phoonk di or sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke idia ne janm le liya
 Akhilesh Yadav worked to bring this idea to the end
 ajtak ke intervyuu main akhilesh ne bataaya tha ki unhen har haal main yah gathbandhan karnaa hi tha
 Under the coalition formula, the BSP contested 38 seats, the SP 37 and the RLD three seats, while the Amethi and Rae Bareli seats were left for the Congress
 akhilesh ne mayawati ke saath jamkar prachaar bhi kiya
 Even Mayawati and Mulayam Singh Yadav brought Akhilesh to a stage
 1993 sapa-basapa gathbandhan jaise chunaav nateezon par bhi charchaa hui, jab naaraa chalaa tha 'mili mulaayam-kanshiram, hawa main ud gaye jayshriram' lekin is sabake baavjood agsit pole ke jo anumaan saamne aa rahe hai, wo sapa-basapa gathbandhan ke liye behad niraashajanak hai
 If these estimates change in the results, then the second and most important experiment of Akhilesh Yadav's politics will also fail
 namo food ke packet poling booth ke andar jate dekhte hi sabakaa maathaa thanka
 By the time we could understand the media, the box disappeared in a blink of an eye
 noida sector 15e ke aaleeshaan club ke andar bane teen poling boothon main wo packet kahaan rakhe gaye iskaa pataa hi nahin chalaa
 However, he later went to the belly of the polling party
 lekin namo food kya he, yahaan tak kaise aayaa, ye sawaal math rahe the lihaaja iske andar tak ghusna lajimi tha

 baad main khabar ai ki gajiabad main bhi namo food ke aise hi packet poling partiyon ke liye laae gaye
 We also tweeted to the Election Commission and gave information about it with the picture, what the hell is this? ayog ne 2 ghante baad bataaya ki iskaa nirvachan ayog yaa aachaar samhita se koi lenaa dena nahin
 Because it is an old firm that has registered its establishment in the name of Namo Food
 aise main philhal to na aachaar samhita uskaa kuch bigaad sakati he or naa hi ayog
 Now we reached Namo Food located in Noida Sector-2
 is food chen ke manager sunil anand ko phone milaayaa to wo khud khaanaa hi kha rahe the
 They also ran in 5 minutes
 jab unako sari baat bataai to wo bhi muskaraa uthe
 He says that this is an establishment about a year and a half old
 ab noida or greater noida main is food chen kii 5 shakhaaen hai
 If we talk about the name, then we asked that you too kept the name after thinking the same way
 sunil anand ne muskuraate hue kaha ki nahin hamaari soch to sanskrit ke namo nam: se judi he, jiskaa sidhaa arth namaskara or swaagat se he
 He also added that our logo ie symbol is also linked hands
 lekin siyaasi phija he, har koi siyaasi myne hi khojataa or lagaataa he
 We then investigated the polling party
 ek adhikari ne kaha ki darasal navaratri kii vajah se adhiktar adhikari shaakaahaari khaanaa chaahate the
 They were told that its food is right
 lihaaja hamane vahiin se online order dekar khaanaa mangaya
 Now, how true is his matter, how much it is to harvest, only his heart knows
 ab chunaav main haar-jeet kiski hogi iske liye to 23 may tak intjaar karnaa hoga
 But it is certain that Namo Food came out
 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main

 Senior BJP leader and former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha has attacked Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in a befitting manner
 jiesti kii vifaltaaon kaa zikr karte hue sinha ne kaha ki deshavaasiyon ko hui mushkilon ke liye jetali ko pad se istipha dena chahie, saath hi unhone kaha ki gujarat kii janata ko jetali boj lagate hai
 Let us tell you that Arun Jaitley has been elected a Rajya Sabha member from Gujarat
 modi sarkaar kii aarthik nitiyon kii aalochana kar rahe sinha ne ahmedabad main aarope bhi lagaaya ki sabhi pahaluon par vichaar kiye bina hi jiesti ko lagu kar diya gaya
 Former Union Finance Minister Sinha said that the Indian economy has suffered a setback in the form of demonetisation and GST
 yashavanth sinha ko ‘lokshahi bachaao andolan’ se jude kaaryakartaaon ne notebandi or jiesti ke prabhaav or arthvyavastha kii maujuuda sthiti ke bare main vichaar rakhane karne ke liye gujarat bulaayaa tha
 In response to a question, Sinha said, 'our finance minister is not from Gujarat and he has been elected to the Rajya Sabha from here
 vahgujrat kii janata par bojhahai
 Had he not been selected from here, a Gujarati would have got a chance
 unhone kaha ki vitt mantri keval ek vyavastha main vishwaas karte hai ki ‘chitt bhi meri, patt bhi meri’
 Sinha said that such anomalies and anarchy could have been avoided if proper care had been taken while fixing the GST rates
 unhone kaha, ‘vah desh main gaharaai tak doshapurn kar pranali lagu karne kaa shrey nahin le sakate or is desh kii janata ko bhaleebhanti is maang ko uthaane kaa adhikaar he ki unhen apana pad chhod dena chahie’
 Let us tell you that Jaitley had said a few days ago that Sinha is looking for work at the age of 80 years
 is par sinha ne kaha ki vah ab bhi tandoorust hai or un logon kii tarah nahin hai jo baithkar bhaashan dete hai
 His gesture was towards Jaitley sitting in the middle of the budget speech in Parliament
 naam liye bina sinha ne kaha ki kuch logon ne unke or unke bete kendriya mantri jayant sinha ke bich daraar paidaa karne kii koshish kii lekin unhen safalataa nahin mil saki
 Delay in justice creates unrest in public mind, anger court has asked many questions from Central and State Governments
 Seven years' wait to sentence the culprits in the Nirbhaya case and the outrage in the public after the Hyderabad case has increased the concern of the Supreme Court
 mahila aparaadhon se nipatane or doshiyon ko samay se sajaa or peediton ko nyaay dilaane ke liye supreme court ke chif justise vaali bench ne suo moto rit ke jariye centre or sabhi rajya sarkaron kii khabar lee he
 The Supreme Court has also called for the details of the Nirbhaya Fund from the Center and the states
 is swatah sangyaan vaali rit yachika ke zarie court ne kaha ki nyaay main deree janata ke man main ashaanti, gussa or adheeratha paidaa karti he
 a bench of Chief Justice Bobde, Justice BR Gavai and Justice Suryakant has also stated in this writ that the delay in getting justice due to the complication of the justice process creates unrest, anger and resentment in the public
 court ne kaha ki nirbhaya cese ne puure desh ko jhakzor diya tha
 After this, in view of public sentiment, the Parliament also changed the law, but the Nirbhaya case has not reached the final stage till date
 jabaki ye akelaa aisa cese nahin he
 Justice Bobadene said that agencies work fast after seeing people's anger
 mahilaon se rape ke maamalon main nyaayik prakriya main deree par supreme court ne ye bada kadam uthaaya he
 Chief Justice Bobde took suo motu cognizance of the incidents of crime against women across the country
 centre or rajya sarkaron ko noticeeef justise necendre sarkaror sabhi rajyon ko notice jari kar kaha he ki maujuuda kanoon, system or police karrwai ke tareekon ko sakht or javabdeh karne kii zarurat he
 Not only this, ensuring better medical facilities to the victims should also be a priority
 centre sahit sabhi rajyon ke liye jari notice main chif justise ne kaha he ki 2017 main deshbhar main 32559 rape cese saamne aae jo ki behad chintajanak hai
 The Chief Justice has summoned a status report from the Chief Secretaries and Director Generals of Police of all states regarding the current legal course of action
 court ne rajyon se ye bhi poocha he ki mahilaon ke khilaaf hone vaale aparaadhon main police karrwai kya hui he? kitni tezi se hui he? sajaa dilaane kaa anupaat or pratishat kitna rahaa he?court ne ye bhi jaananaa chaha he ki abhiyojan kaise kaam kar rahaa he? forencik agenciyaan kitni hai or unke paas jaanch ke kya kya saadhan hai? takanic kitni sateek, aadhunik or vaigyanik he? staff kitna he or kitna prashikshit bhi
 What action was taken against how many policemen who did not file cases on time or did not file cases? That is, how many were suspended and how many were dismissed
 court ne poocha ki rape peedita kii chikitsa or uski medical jaanch kaa tarika or saadhan kya he? kya sabhi aspataalon main rape peedita or aaropee kii medical jaanch ke liye tay maanakon vaali medical kit he? kya sabhi nijee or sarkari aspataal rape peedita ko free ilaj dete hai yaa nahin? adaalaton main rape cese kii sunwaayee sirf mahila jaj karen, iskaa kya aankada he
 Not only the courts angry with the attitude of the states, angry and upset with the sluggish attitude of the states, the Supreme Court asked the state governments how much special courts they have
 How many fast tracks are there in them? What is the figure for speedy disposal of cases? Also, what is being done to ensure that the trial is completed soon and in due time
 court ne rajyon ko bheje notice main ye bhi jaananaa chaha he ki mahilaon se rape yaa shoshan ke maamalon main vakeelon kii cese main upasthiti sunishchit rahe iske liye kya kiya ja rahaa he? supreme court ne sabhi hoicourt ke register general ko bhi is kaam main sahyog dene kaa nirdesh diya he
 The court fixed February 7 for next hearing
 diwaali ek aisa bada tyohaar he jiskaa intjaar film celebrities bhi badi besabri se karte hai
 It is always seen that the films released on Diwali like Holi, Eid and Christmas earn a lot at the box office
 pichley hi saal (2015) main diwaali ke maukey par relies hui film 'prem ratan dhan payo' ne kul 240 karod kii kamai kii thi or is film kaa pehle din kaa opening collection hi 44 karod kaa tha
 Earlier in the year 2014, Shah Rukh Khan's film 'happy New Year' gave an opening of 45 crores
 ab is saal 2016 main box offis par diwaali ke maukey par do badi filmon kii bhidnt hone vaali he
 On one side is Karan Johar's multi-starrer film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' full of love, romance and drama and on the other side is Ajay Devgn's action packed film 'shivaay'
 kya 'shivaay' kaa palada he baari?donon filmon kii timen ji-jaan lagaakar pramotion main juty hui hai
 Trade analysts believe that both films will give openings between 12 to 14 crores
 lekin kahin naa kahin soshal media par jari bahes ko dekhte hue lagata he ki 'shivaay' kaa palada baari he, iskaa sabase bada kaaran hafilm 'i dil he mushkil'main pakistani actor fawaad khan kaa hona
 However, the fans of Karan's romantic drama film Ranbir Kapoor, Aishwarya Rai and Anushka Sharma's fan following are amazing
 lekin abhi bhi audiyans kaa ek bada hissaa isamen pakistani actor hone kii vajah se isse kanni katate dikh rahaa he
 In this film, the story of the deteriorating relationship is shown
 vahiin duusari taraf'shivaay' ajay devganke nirdesan main bani duusari film he
 Ajay considers this action-adventure film to be a father-daughter story
 vaise mujeec kii agar baat kii jaae, to karan kii film ajay kii film se kahin aage he or iskaa mujeec youth ne behad pasand kiya he
 Films are being promoted at the international level, if it is of the global market, then Ajay Devgan has promoted his film at the international level along with India keeping in mind the international marketing
 haalanki is maamle main karan bhi peeche nahin hai
 Trade analysts believe that 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' has to gross at least 110 crores to be a box office hit given the cost of films, while 'shivaay' has to collect 130 crores to succeed
 Will happen
 controvarsi main na rahane kaa mil saktaa he phaaydavaise to karan johar kii filmein multiplex audiyans ke liye hoti he
 But 'shivaay' has been made keeping in mind the audience of both single screen and multiplexes, which can benefit from the film opening well
 sabase badi baat yah he ki'shivaay'kaa naam kisi bhi controvarsi main sunne main nahin aayaa, jabaki'i dil he mushkil'fawaad khan kii vajah se kaaphi controvarsi main rahi
 As of now, it is now being released in all states
 ajay ko mil saktaa he iroj se haath milaane kaa phaaydaek gaur karne vaali baat yah bhi he ki ajay devgan ne apni film kii badi opening or relies ke liye aros international se haath milaayaa he jabaki karan johar kii 'i dil he mushkil' ke paas koi ko-produsar nahin he
 The rest will be how the performance of both films will be revealed after three days
 chandramaa prithvi par sabase zyada asar daalane vaala grah he
 This has a direct effect on the person's mind and sanskars, so each and every yoga formed by the moon is so much more important
 chandramaa se teen prakaar ke shubh yoga banate hai - anpha , sunpha or durdhara or ek ashubh yoga bhi banataa he - kemdrum
 If there is Kemdrum Yoga in the horoscope, then a lot of auspicious yoga results
 yah vyakti ko maansik pidaa or daridrata detaa he
 How is Kemdrum Yoga made and what is its effect? - If there is no planet on either side of the moon - and if there is no sight of any planet on it, Kemdrum becomes Yoga - in such a situation a person suffers from mental illness or mental pain
 Have to face - sometimes there is a problem like epilepsy - one also has to face poverty - there are many ups and downs about money - due to this, the person does not have the happiness of mother Lta- Kemdraum Yoga Cancer, Scorpio and much worse Pisces ascendant Hakb Kemdraum Yoga is dissolved? beesvin sadi ke mahapurushon main shiridy ke sai baba ko gina jaataa he
 He had won the hearts of his critics by serving the poor, the afflicted and the orphans selflessly
 maanavtaa kii seva main unka koi sani nahin tha
 He never allowed religion to come in his work and quietly served every religion and community
 maharashtra ke shiridy gram ko unhone apni karmasthali banaaya or jivan bhar vahiin rahe
 He used to celebrate Diwali with Hindus and Eid with Muslims
 unhone dharm ke aadhaar par kisi ke saath koi vyavhaar nahin kiya or apana jivan kamjor tathaa sarvhaara varg ko arpit kar diya
 He is considered a vivid example of hindu-muslim unity
 vah maanate the ki dharm chaahe jo bhi ho ishwar ek he
 This is the reason that his popularity grew and he was able to get the status of a great sage by a fakir
 aaj desh-videsh main badi taadaad main unke anuyaayi hai
 Millions of devotees visit his temple in Shirdi every year to worship him and seek his blessings
 yah koi maamuli baat nahin he ki maharashtra ke ek sudur gaanv main chupchaap garibon or laachaaron kii seva karne vaala ek fakir itnaa desh main lokapriy ho jaae ki log use bhagwaan kii darja hi de de
 But now Shankaracharya Swaroopananda Saraswati has given rise to an unnecessary controversy by saying various things about him
 unka kahana he ki sai baba kii puja hindu dharm ko baantne kii sajeesh he or iske peeche videshi takatein hai
 Hindu religion will be weakened by this
 shankaracharya bayaan dete vakt yah bhul gaye ki hindu dharm to jati or paramparaon ke aadhaar par pehle se hi banta hua dharm he or use ek karne ke liye aaj bhi koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya ja rahaa he
 Today, all kinds of malpractices, superstitions and wrong traditions are being promoted in Hinduism, but Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati does not speak anything about them
 jis hindu dharm main nari kii puja kii baaten kii jaati hai, vahaan unki sabase zyada durdasha he
 The process of earning money in the name of religion is going on and hundreds of fake babas are wandering in every corner of the country, why did they not open their mouth about them? Why did he never say anything about the way money is made from devotees in big temples? Sayin Baba is not even ready to accept him as a Guru and his reasoning is strange
 unka kahana he ki guru adarshavaadi hota he or sai baba aise nahin the
 This is a gross misrepresentation
 sai baba ne jo adarsh sthapit kiye ve bahut kam log hi kar pate hai
 His statement that Britain wants to divide Hindus is grossly irresponsible
 unhen ek sachche hindu kii tarah sahansheeltaa or dayalutaa kii pratimurti kii tarah vyavhaar karnaa chahie na ki ek ashishnu or sankeern soch vaale vyakti kii tarah
 The rank of Shankaracharya is large and good and scholarly things are always expected from him
 swaroopanand saraswati is tathy ko samajhakar hi bayaan dete to behatar he

 zyada jaankaree ke lieyaha clic karen In collaboration with administrative officials in Banda, Uttar Pradesh, Mineral Director Roshan Jacob has secretly taken major action on illegal mining of sand in rivers
 do din kii lagaataar chaanbin main jile ke alag alag margon se 183 overlod trakon par karrwai kii gai he
 He also put the district administration, standing with crores of revenue recovery and mining mafia, in the dock
 khanij nideshak roshan jaikab ne ken nadi par do khadaanon ko sij karne ke saath shesh anya kii jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 These are the two mines raided by ASP LBK Pal and ADM Santosh Bahadur Singh on the night of 8-9 January and seized close to 100 trucks and 7 Pokeland machines
 haalanki baad main jiladhikari ke str par kadi karrwai ke bajaay maamle main lipapoti kar di gai thi
 The matter was also raised at the governance level by 'aaj Tak', on which the government lost sleep and the Director of Minerals was sent to Banda for action
 apni jaanch main nideshak ne khanij adhikari shailendra singh ko bhi doshi maanate hue bhavishya ke liye sachet kiya he
 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) local MLA Brajesh Prajapati told Mumbai over phone, 'the mineral director had to come to Banda from Lucknow as the DM and the mineral officials here are directly involved and guilty
 in par bhi karrwai honi chahie
 'jacob Bjacb's harsh attitude with the special team reached Banda on the night, can be gauged from the fact that she came to Banda with the special team on the night of 24 January without informing the district administration, and started taking action
 'ajtak' se unhone nadiyon main ho rahe avaidh khanan par kadi karrwai ke sanket dete hue bataaya, 'overlod trakon ko pakadaa gaya he or avaidh khanan par bhi karrwai kii jaaegi
 Noticing DM Hiralal's poor attitude in cases of illegal mining, he instructed to work seriously in such cases in future
 agle hi subah dm ko liye bagaiyr jaikab pailaani tehsil antargat sari khadar ja pahunchin
 Where he found evidence of illegal mining from a heavy Pokeland machine in the river in sections 1 and 4
 haalanki sthaneey logon kii mileebhagat se pockland mashiinon ko vahaan se pehle hi hataaya ja chukaa tha
 He also found evidence of mining being done by stopping river water
 maukey par sisitivi camere nahin the
 After this, she also went to the Amlore Khadar and Padohra Khadar mines of the Ken river, where she found evidence of illegal mining under the cover of various irregularities
 barish kii vajah se nadi kinare phislan bhare raaston or sthaneey adhikariyon kii khanan mafiaon se mileebhagat ke baavjood jaikab kii karrwai jari rahi
 The Director of Minerals wrote in his order that "both the 46 mt and 13 hectare seas mines of Sari Khadar will recover 5 times the price of illegal sand extraction
 aisa na hone tak khanan or parivahan kaary pratibandhit rahegaa
 If this amount is not deposited, the security amount will be forfeited and the lease will be canceled
 shesh 15 khadaanon kaa bhi survey turant karaayaa jaae
 "he has ordered the SP to take action against the local Paprenda and the Khaptiha police outpost incharge in secret action, guilty of not cooperating with them
" avaidh khanan or overloding par niyantran na rakh paane kaa doshi maanate hue khanij adhikari shailendra singh ko chetavanee di gai he
 Significantly, illegal mining was at its peak in the Bain district with the help of the administration of heavy Pokeland machines in the Ken, Yamuna and Bagai rivers
 ken nadi kii duredi, lahureta, ganchhaa, sari khadar, amalor, padohara, nihalpur, jerar or kolaval khadaanon samet yamuna nadi kii sadimadanpur or baagi nadi kii mahuta or chandaur khadaanon main jaldhara rokkar ho rahe avaidh khanan se logon main jamkar aakrosh tha
 The overload trucks forcibly discharged from the fields under the protection of the Ashaldhari hens were ruining farmers' crops
 isse kisaanon main rosh vyaapt tha
 In the name of action, the district administration continued to stand completely with the mining mafia
 yuva espi ne kuch karravaaiyaan jarur kii lekin prashasnic str par usapar bhi tamaam adnge lagane ke prayaas khanan mafiaon ko phayda pahunchane ke liye hote rahe
 In such a situation, the government had to intervene and take action on its own
 patel ankal ke yahaan hum
 From the window i see that the tea that has been boiled many times in the tea table is once again boiling
 vahaan chah-ek log hai, jinhone donon haathon main kaanch kaa janaa-pahachaanaa shaktishaalee gilaas jakad rakhaa he
 The glass that has been authorized to be brewed at the national level
 ankal kii bitiyaa homework karne drawing room main aa gai he
 In a nice woolen hat, bloated soft sweater, two pebbles hanging from the shoulders and shoes, she looks cute enough to be held tight in her arms
 uske sharir main abhi-abhi nahaakar aane kii khushboo he
 It is very cold
 ho saktaa he yah bhram hi ho, par mujhe lagata he ki sardiyon main ham khushabuon ke prati kuch atirikt mohabbat main pad jate hai
 It is possible that the nostrils become strong during this season
 ek chiz samajhane ko paanch vaakya jaaya karnaa aparaadh sareekha he, isliye chauthe se labboluab yun samajhie ki khushbuin mahasoos karne ke liye sardiyaan mujhe sabase makul lagati hai, bas
 After lading Kittu, i start thinking about this season and the memories leave me with school
 tab main bahut kuch khushabuon se hi pahachaanata or yaad rakhata tha
 The smell of the pencil
 rabar kii khushboo
 Second hand book of history and smell of teacher's signature
 kisi aghoshit niyam kii tarah har chiz ko naak ke paas le janaa tha mujhe
 In the winter, we also deal with hot and hot things like this
 chaay, soup, saag or subjiyon kii khushabuon main hamaari utsukata kuch bad jaati he or unhen khate-pite hue ham thodi-thodi khushboo bhi khate-pite rahete hai
 Ginger also begins to decimate
 mujhe yaad he, sardiyaan aane ke saath ek nai tarah kii khushboo kaa anubhav tab hota, jab sandukon-aalmariyon se sweater nikaale jate
 i loved the sweaters before the sunshine because the scent was not found anywhere else
 skool main mere ve dost jo hameshaa pencil chhilte yaa rabar se mitaate rahete the, pencil yaa rabar kii tarah mahakane lage the
 He used to know and remember that he had a habit of peeling pencils and rubbing rubber
 ham jaanate the ki kiske paas koun si rabar milegi, kiski rabar ghisi hui kaali hogi or laal vaali mahakaua koun rakhe hoga
 It was also a method of identifying classmates
 pencil-rabar kii mili-juli khushboo main ek qism kii vicitra baat thi, jo itr main nahin ho sakati thi
 The day this smell does not happen, some of us would say, 'looks like they have not come today'
 phir kahin se awaz aati, 'ham aae hai, par apni pencil-rabar laana bhul gaye'
 When i came of age to write with a pen, i began to understand the differences between the Syahis' fragrances
 mujhe yaad he, hindi-copy ke 'joda-pej' par udhaar kii mahakati kalam se maine sundar-sundar shabdaarth likhe the, jinhen yaad karne main mujhe nunatam vaqt laga tha
 If the mother used to read, she would sit down in the copy and feel green with the smell of favorite ink
 neeli main jo mahakane vaali syaahi thi, wo kuch bangnee hoti thi or laal vaali kuch gulabi
 As if the scent made the ink color naughty
 yah moonch lagate hi ram ko shyaam main badalte dekhne ke 'golmaali romaanch' jaisaa tha
 i used to enjoy it
 homework main kittu kii madad kar rahaa hum
 She writes very close to the copy
 is dauraan uskaa sir tirachha rahata he
 In between she raises her head and smiles at me
 chote bacchon ke gaalon kii khushboo par main jaan chhidakta tha
 If a guest child came home, i would blossom
 us abodh ke gaal par naak dharkar use chuumata rahata
 Mother tells everyone, children like it very much
 mere jivan kii sabase prachlit khushbuin tab yahi thim
 It seemed like a good thing, when pencil-rubber smelling friends sat on their arms
 khushabuon vaale sketch-pen kii zid karata tha
 He smiled at the Joker and stood in one corner of his ridiculous world, thinking seriously that the scent of the sketch should be in people's bodies, not here
 har ek ke
 i had often wished to divide my world-oriented happiness into friends one by one
 main chahta tha ki ve bachche bhi isi tarah mahakein, jinke saath khilne se mujhe manaa kiya jaataa rahaa
 i was not brought up much by the deep-seated and raw smells of life then
 lekin unke prati kisi tarah kii hin bhaavana se grast kabhi nahin tha
 Even now it should not be understood that i classify the existence of smells as good and evil
 dettol se nahaakar yaa hand sanitizer chupadakar nikle shaks kii tarah kabhi nahin rahaa, jo bade hi saamanti aatmavishvaas se khud ko sabase higinic samajhataa he
 There were many more fragrances in my world, which are not recognized right now
 unke bare main sochna hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 Although i do not know how the smell is imagined
 kittu un khushabuon ko behatar jaanati hogi
 My ability to record pleasantries has decreased now
 yah bhi sambhav he ki sab khushbuin kisi yaadakaane main kahin bahut tezi se darj ho rahi hon or umr ke kisi padaav par unka darj hona dikhe
 Aunt has brought saffron milk to me
 chikhaanaa ab bhi gulzaar he
 Kittu is peeling the pencil

 gujarat kii janata ne gajab kaa faisla diya he
 The BJP was claiming to win 150 seats in Gujarat, but the people of Gujarat took the air out of these blatant claims and implicated the BJP in the turn of 99
 janata ne gujarat ko purna bahumat vaali sarkaar to di, saath hi majboot vipaksh bhi de diya
 In fact, this is a truly unprecedented victory for the BJP in Gujarat, a victory like never before
 22 saalon main sabase kam faasale se jeet
 The BJP, which won 127 assembly seats in Gujarat in 2002, could not reach even three digits this time and got stuck in the 99 mark
 gujarat kii janata ne gajab kar diya, satta to de di, lekin majboot vipaksh bhi de diya, tabhi to congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi harkar bhi aastinein chadha rahe hai
 If there is a chance of a BJP government in Gujarat, then most of its credit goes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while the Congress president Rahul Gandhi has a big role to play if the Congress emerges as strong in Gujarat
 sahi myne main pehali baar gujarat hi rahul gandhi or pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa aamane-saamne kaa rankshetra bana, donon ne chunaav prachaar main jamkar pasinaa bahaya to nattejey bhi usee ke mutabik aae
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi held 34 rallies, while Rahul Gandhi held 30 rallies in Gujarat
 pradhanmantri modi gujarat kii 134 siton tak pahunche, to vahiin rahul gandhi 120 siton tak pahunch paae
 The BJP won 72 out of the 134 seats visited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while the Congress candidate won 62 of the 120 seats where Rahul Gandhi reached
 kamyaabi kaa aankada dekhen to modi kii kamyaabi kaa pratishat 54 rahaa, jabaki rahul apni party ko 52 fisadi kamyaabi dilava paae
 This election of Gujarat was unprecedented in many respects
 is chunaav main bijepi or congress donon ko kai sabak mili, jati or dharm ke aadhaar par raajnneeti ko bhi sabak mila
 All the mathematics of protest and support changed
 muslim bahut 18 siton bijepi ne 9 siten jeet leen, jabaki congress 7 siten hi jeet pai
 This time 31 percent of Patidar voters shifted from BJP to Congress, due to which BJP lost 15 seats
 patidaar bahul 54 siton main se congress ne 30 siten jeetin, jabaki bijepi ko sirf 23 siton milin
 The BJP lost 12 seats in Saurashtra due to the collapse of the Patidars
 congress ne jaateey aadhaar par patidaar netaa hardik patel, obisi netaa alpesh thakor or dalit netaa jignesh mewaani ko apane saath liya tha
 But out of 37 seats under the influence of Hardik Patel, BJP won 25, while Congress got only 9 seats
 obisi bahul 38 siton kii ladaai main bijepi ko 17 or congress ko 21 siten milin
 Out of the 7 seats dominated by Dalits, BJP won 7, while Congress won 6 seats
 gujarat ke chunaav main congress kaa chunaav abhiyaan teji se aage badha tha, lekin manishankar ayyar ke ek bayaan ne duusare charan main pasa hi palat diya
 Although the Congress made a lot of efforts to control damage on Mani Shankar Iyer's statement, but Prime Minister Modi made it an issue in the elections
 modi ne neech kaa mudda us surat or aasapaas ke ilaakon main bhunaaya, jahaan unka sabase zyada virodh ho rahaa tha
 As a result, the BJP won 15 out of 16 seats in Surat and surrounding areas
 congress ke paas is chunaav main khone ke liye kuch nahin tha, yahi vajah he ki puure chunaav main rahul gandhi frat foot par the, modi sarkaar kii nitiyon par jamkar hamalaa bolte rahe
 People of Gujarat heard the words of Rahul Gandhi, heard them properly
 congress ko gujarat main satta bhale nahin mil pai, lekin bijepi ke liye ye chunaav bahut bada sabak he
 The Congress has made a dent in the bjp's strongest youth vote bank in Gujarat
 gujarat main is baar 18 se 40 saal kii umr ke 38 fisadi voter congress ke paale main aa gaye, jabaki 2012 main gujarat ke sirf 25 fisadi yuva congress ke saath the
 Not only this, the Congress has made tremendous threats in rural areas
 gujarat ke gramin ilaakon kii 127 siton main se congress or uske sahyogiyon ne 68 siton par kabja jamaaya he
 Whereas BJP lost 14 seats in these areas and was reduced to just 56 seats
 gujarat ke chunaavon ke ye nattejey bahut kuch kehete hai
 Entrusted power to the BJP, but after getting stuck in 99, gave a strong message for the future

 The US space agency NASA has said that a large asteroid is moving towards the ground

 However, for such a large asteroid, it would be very close to the ground '
 kitna bada he ye Asteroid ?nasa ke NEOWISE spes prob ke mutabik iskaa sies 2,000 foot yani 650 meter he
 This is equivalent to six fields of football
 kya aap ise dekh sakenge?2014 J024 naam ke is Asteroid ko shaayad dekh saken, kyonki iskaa surphace riflactive he 
 However, a telescope may be required to view it
 agar aapke paas telescope nahin he to aap ise online bhi dekh sakate hai
 NASA has said, 'this asteroid will come from the direction of the sun and it will show up at night after April 19'
 Let us know that it was discovered three years ago and it will be so close to the ground for the first time in 400 years

 During the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, before the Samajwadi Party (SP) state president Akhilesh Yadav's meetings, a hat-tricked young man wore a red socialist cap on his head and pressed a diary in the side to take stock of the preparations for the meeting
 hariyaanvi andaaj main hindi bolkar or sthaneey logon kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchakar manch kaa safaltaapurvak sanchaalan karne vaale is yuva netaa 40 varshiya sanjay lathar ne us kaam ke liye itani surkhiyaan nahin batorin, jitani ki pichley dedh maah ke dauraan yuvajan sabha ke rashtriya adhyaksh pad se hatane or dobaaraa us par asin hone ke kram main jutai hai
 Within a month, Lathar has emerged as the most influential among the young leaders of SP by retaining this position
 haryana ke jind jile ke julanaa gaanv main janme sanjay lathar un chuninda yuva netaaon kii jamaat main shaamil hai, jinhone khud apane balboote raajnneeti main paanv jamaaye hai
 Lathar, who holds a master's degree in five disciplines including a phd in journalism, is a product of student politics in Haryana
 isi dauraan ve haryana ke samaajawaadee netaa or purv mukhyamantri hukum singh ke sampark main aae
 “kum Singh together with Lather formed the Samajwadi Party in Haryana in June 1992
 jab november, 1992 main mulaayam singh yadav ne uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party kaa gathan kiya to hukum singh ne apni party kaa isamen vilay kar diya
 Since then, Lathar became close to Mulayam Singh Yadav
 lathar haryana main samaajawaadee yuvajan sabha ke pramukh mahasachiv bane
 In the 1998 general election, he contested from Haryana's Sonipat Lok Sabha seat on a SP ticket and finished third
 iske baad mulaayam singh ne 2002 main lathar ko samaajawaadee chaatrasabha kaa rashtriya adhyaksh bana diya
 This was the time, which moved his steps towards the politics of Uttar Pradesh
 haalanki 2005 ke vidhansabha chunaav main haryana kii julanaa seat se bhi lathar ko niraashaa hi haath lagi, lekin unhone uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee chaatr andolan ko ek nai disha di
 He is also credited for bringing forward leaders of backward classes in large numbers in the student movement
 pichley saal jab party ne vidhansabha chunaavon kii taiyaari shuru kii to akhilesh yadav ne lathar ko apane chunaav prachaar ke prabandhan kaa kaam saunpa
 "akhilesh Yadav held more than 100 rallies in the entire state during the assembly elections," says Anand Singh Bhadoria, Lathar's associate and national president of the socialist Lohia Vahini
 har raily main bheed umadi, lekin tanik bhi avyavashtha nahin hui
 With this, their election management can be gauged
 ”vidhansabha chunaav ke baad rashtriya lokdal ke rashtriya mahasachiv jayant chedhri ke istife se khaali hui mathura kii maant vidhansabha seat par hue upachunaav main sapa ne lathar ko utaara
 Lather completed a trio of defeats in this by-election held in June
 magar khaas baat yah rahi ki unhen chunaav main 50,000 se zyada vot mili, jabaki teen maah pehle hue mukhya chunaav main isi seat se sapa pratyaashee ko mahaj 1,200 voton se santosh karnaa padaa tha
 Trinamool Congress leader Shyam Sundar Sharma, who won the Mant assembly by-election, says, "I am surprised by the way Sanjay Lather shed money in the election" The influence of leather also increased
 sapa ke yuva netaaon main keval lathar hi aise netaa hai, jinhen mukhyamantri karyaalay main berokatoke aane-jane kii anumati he
 According to party insiders, after the formation of the SP government in the state, the efforts of several tainted builders to get the government's permission for the project had brought Lathar on the target of the party high command and this is the removal of his youth from the post of national president of the assembly
 Also caused haalanki lathar apane upar lagane vaale sabhi aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kehete hai, ‘‘adhyaksh pad se hataane ke baad mujhe koi chargeshit nahin mili
 i was not able to declare a new executive of the House, probably due to busy in the Mont assembly by-election
 isi vajah se mujhe hataaya gaya
 "but the manner in which a large number of the party's loyal young workers have been sidelined in the Executive Committee, formed after assuming the post of the National President of Yuvajan Sabha, will not end the problems of lathi at present
" samaajawaadee yuvajan sabha kii neenv daalane vaale samaajawaadee netaa raamamanohar lohia ne shaayad kabhi yah sochaa bhi nahin hoga ki isaki kaman sanbhaalane vaale netaa bhavishya main landcruger or prado jaisi mahangi gadipoon main ghumenge
 If Lathar really wants to work, then he will have to get rid of this image
 uttar pradesh kii yogi adityanath sarkaar kaa mangalvaar ko apana pehla bajet pesh karegi
