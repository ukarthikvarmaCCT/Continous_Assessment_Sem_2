 baithak main hissaa lene vaale sutron kii maane to yah vampanthi dal 2019 main congress ke saath gathbandhan main jane kaa man bana rahi he
 According to sources, within 3 years, the CPM is preparing to move away from its old stand and go back to the secular parties, including the Congress
 yah isliye bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki 3 saal pehlevishakhapattanam main hui party congresamen yah prastaav paas hua tha ki vampanthi dal na to bijepi or na hi congress ke saath kisi tarah kaa talmail yaa gathbandhan karenge
 WHAT HAPPENED According to the information received in the CPM Central Committee meeting, in the CPM Central Committee meeting, party general secretary Sitaram Yechury made a proposal, which said that all the secular parties should be given to the Left parties to defeat the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 Differences between Yechury and Karat In the Central Committee meeting, differences between Yechury and former General Secretary Prakash Karat came to the fore
 congress samet tamaam dharmanirpeksh partiyon ke saath jane ke yechuri ke prastaav ke khilaaf karaat ne ek doosraa prastaav kendriya samiti kii baithak main rakh diya, jisamen vampanthi dalon ko kisi bhi party se chunavi talmail na rakhane kii baat kahi gai he
 Prakash Karat has said in the resolution that the CPM should neither form an alliance with the BJP nor with the Congress
 prakaash karaat dwaara pesh kiya gaya prastaav isliye bhi ahm he kyonki is prastaav ko sipiem kii paulitte beuro main bahumat se manjuuri mil chuki he
 What is the Politburo's recent meeting of the CPM Politburo, Yechury had proposed that the party will have to stand with all the secular parties including Congress in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, but in the 16-member Politburo, Yechury is alone about this proposal Gone
 prakaash karaat ne yechuri ke us prastaav ko paulitte beuro main khaarij kar diya or kaha ki vampanthi dalon ko na to bijepi or na hi congress se samjhauta karne kii jarurat he
 The proposal of Prakash Karat was passed by the Politburo with a majority and Yechury's proposal was agreed to in a minority

 sutron ke mutabik kerala or tripura main party kader chahta he ki loksabhaa chunaav main CPM congress samet tamaam dharmanirpeksh partiyon ke saath khadi rahe, taaki voton kaa bantwaaraa naa ho
 But Prakash Karat's faction in the party is against Yechury's proposal
 somvaar ko yechuri or prakaash karaat donon ke prastaav par kendriya samiti main voting ho sakati he
 The CPM will place the reservation proposed by the Central Committee after voting in the party Congress to be held in Hyderabad next year
 sipiem is party congress ke baad hi 2019 ke chunaav ke liye apni disha or dasha tay karegi
 For the present, party sources say that most of the members of the Central Committee agree with Yechury's proposal that the CPM has to run with all secular and opposition parties to defeat the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 NIA ke mutabik haadia ne jaanch main NIA kii bhoomika par hi gambhir sawaal uthaae hai, jin par agency ko aapatti he
 The NIA says that there is a lot of evidence in the investigation which indicates the involvement of the terrorist organization Islamic State (IS) in this case

 While the girl's father said that she was seduced and married
 jabaki haadia kaa kahana tha ki usne apni marji se shaadi kii thi or us par koi dabaav nahin tha

 ashokan kii ore se supreme court se aagrah kiya gaya ki NIA kii ore se uthaai gai aapattiyon ko court zarur sune, iske baad unka paksh bhi suna jaae
 During the hearing, the Supreme Court remarked that in Hadia's affidavit, the facts which are not related to marriage can be ignored, but the question is, how did the High Court declare marriage void? The Supreme Court is hearing in the 'love Jihad' case in Kerala
 akhila urf haadia ne supreme court main halafanama daakhil kar kaha ki vah musalmaan he or musalmaan ke taur par hi apni jindagi jeena chaahati he
 Hadiya has also stated in her affidavit that she is the wife of Shafeen Jahan, whom she has converted to Islam to marry

 The Supreme Court then directed Hadiya to continue her studies in the college, freeing her from the guardianship of her parents

 Sehwag is recovering from a shoulder operation and in his absence, Mukund will open the innings with Gautam Gambhir
 westeindies daure main test cricket main padaarpan karne vaale mukund ne kaha, yadi aap soch rahe hai ki main sahvaag kii jagah bhar duungaa, to yah naammumkin he
 He is the greatest opener of the Indian team and no one can fill his place
 yadi main unki tarah ballebaaji karne kii koshish karata hum, to yah sambhav nahin he
 i will bat the way i know
 mukund ne lords main pehle test match main pehali pari main 49 or duusari pari main 12 ran banaae, lekin donon avasaron par vah badi pari khilne main naakaam rahe
 This left-handed batsman still has a grudge
 unhone kaha, main lambii pari nahin khel paaya or main bahut niraash tha
 i was batting well, but i can take that confidence into the next Test
 prayek bachche kaa sapana hota he ki vah cricket ke makka par khele or main bahut utsahit tha, lekin durbhaagya se lambii pari nahin khel paaya
 At the beginning of his career, Mukund is facing the world's fastest attack, but he is not worried about it
 munkud ne kaha ki bhartiya team ke saath vah jitna samay bitaa rahe hai, usase unhen kaaphi kuch seekhney ko mil rahaa he
 He said, to be honest, spending so much time with the Indian team gives you something to learn every day
 jab sachin jaisaa khilaadi aapaki peeth thapthapaata he, to isse kisi kaa bhi aatmavishvaas badhegaa
 i am also focusing on improving my performance

 The conditions here are favorable for seam and swing bowling
 mukund ne kaha, maine wicket nahin dekha he, lekin duniya kii number ek team hone ke kaaran hamen apni raah main aane vaali prayek chunauti kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 Many players are highly experienced and have played in such conditions
 hamen acchhee chunauti pesh kerani hogi
 Mukund said that if Zaheer Khan does not play in this match, then the Indian attack will not be completely paralyzed
 unhone kaha, jahir hamaara mukhya gendbaaj he
 However Ishant bowled very well in the Caribbean tour
 praveen ne lords main paanch wicket liye or srisanth apni baari kaa intjaar kar rahaa he

 Badminton star Jwala Gutta, who has threatened the ban from sports administrators, says that she has suffered so much pain and humiliation in the last six months that she has not been able to celebrate the bronze medal in the Asian Championship
 bharat kii sarvshereshth yugal khilaadi jwaala ko bhartiya badminton sangh ke saath kanoonee ladaai ladani padi
 Last year, Jwala's disciplinary committee recommended a lifetime ban on Jwala for allegedly delaying the match between Krish Delhi Smashers and Banga Beats in the Indian Badminton League
 jwaala ne kaha ki asian badminton championships main mili kaansya padak se un jakhmon ko bharne main kuch had tak madad milani he
 He said that this medal is like revenge for me
 main ab badale kii bhaavana se khel rahi hum
 i have suffered a lot, if i had not suffered all this, i could have celebrated the medal winning well
 unhone kaha ki jo kuch hua, vah gaiyr jaruri tha
 What does a player need to pay for all this? maine apni uplabdhiyon ke liye paisa nahin maanga
 i had asked for respect but did not get it
 yugal khilaadiyon ke saath pakshpaat kyon
 Jwala's next goal is to win a medal at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
 unhone kaha ki meraa mukhya lakshya aglaa olympic khelnaa he
 i started playing again after the break because i want to win a medal in the Rio Olympics

 kareeb aath dashak baad, pichley saal australia ko bhi yah hathiyaar mil gaya he, jab herold larwood kaa punarjanm ke duusare sire par mishael johnson ke rup main hua
 It seems that when Johnson was busy attacking the British, believing that the middle stump was located somewhere between his ribs and his chin, India was eyeing and taking lessons
 is somvaar (21 july) ko lords kii jeet hamen cricket ke bare main kai rochak sandesh de gai he
 That India too can be intimidated by the speed and bounce of the ball
 lekin leg par chah khiladinnon (do short leg sahit), slip main ek bhi nahin par kisi bedam hook shot ke liye therdman par ek khilaadi ke saath iraadaa ekadam saaf dikh rahaa tha
 It is the new generation of Indian cricket riding on the growing strength of sports establishments in their country

 i enjoyed two of the best moments of this game, one off the field and one on the field
 donon se rabindra jadeja jude rahe hai
 At the end of the fourth day's play, i was asked by Sky Sports at Ian Ward and Shane Warne when they were asked why they waved their bat in a different way after scoring a half-century
 Without any hesitation, he smiled and said, "I don't know what you call it in English, but in my community it is called Talwar and we want to play with it like that
" ”doosraa, jis tarah se ve jimmy anderson kii taraf, antim khilaadi jise unhone abhi-abhi ranout kiya tha, vidaai ke liye haath milaane bade, vah shishtachar kaa dikhaava tha yaa saamaanya khushi ke tahat, main kah nahin saktaa
 But this is more important as India accused Anderson of misbehaving with Jadeja on the steps of Trent Bridge beyond the spirit of the game and cannot be forgiven despite the victory
 aap soch sakate hai ki main is baat ko badha-chadha rahaa hum, lekin main yah ek aise shaks ke naate kah rahaa hum jiske man main ab bhi 22 saal pehle kaa ek daag chupa he
 The case is of Port Elizabeth, when South African Capler Vessels was dragged by his bat on Kapil Dev's leg
 tab main us siries ko india today kii taraf se cover kar rahaa tha
 Millions of people saw that Kapil Dev bowed down with pain
 vesals is baat se agbabula the ki unhone abhi-abhi kasrten ko ''maankaded” (ranout) kar diya tha
 But should one bat on one's leg for this? And that too on a player like Kapil Dev? India opposed it, but in a weak way
 agar us par bada bavaal khadaa kiya jaataa, daure ko khatm karne kii dhamkee di jaati to dakshin africa ghutane tech dete
 But then India was different and its cricket establishment too
 yahaan tak ki kapil bhi kabhi is baat kaa santoshjanak jawaab nahin de paae ki unhone majbootee se iskaa virodh kyon nahin kiya jab unke pair par bada, nila daag ubhar aayaa tha
 Even when i insisted in a long TV interview, he was not ready to speak on it, except for a few words that, "no diplomat wanted to get involved
" ” aaj cricket ke pratishthan aisi baton kii parvaah nahin karte
 So Anderson is still in the dock and Jadeja, who complains, can show him shaking hands in farewell immediately after the runout
 hamane is takat ko badhate hue dekha he
 Like when match referee Mike Denes was ruled out when he accused Sachin Tendulkar of tampering with the ball in South Africa (in 2001)
 andrew symonds ke liye jab harbhajan singh ne 'm’ se shuru hone vaali gaali kaa istemaal kiya tha tab unke saath naram ravaiya hi apanaaya gaya
 In fact, the jury's attitude was lenient, believing that such a 'comment' to someone's mother was worse than saying something about her race
 yah bhartiya cricket kii nai takat he
 This means that if South Africa's only attitude has hurt us, that they have chosen someone we didn't like (aaron Lorgat), then we restricted the series there to just two Tests
 They punished them
 isi tarah, jab 26 / 11 ke aatanki hamale se ai rukaawat ke baad siries ko phir shuru kar england ne hamen khush kiya to hamane puraskaar ke taur par paanch test kii siries karne ke uske anurodh ko sweekaar kar liya, varsh 2002 ke baad kisi bhi desh ke saath pehali baar aisi siries hui thi
 This strength also means that rules can be changed for India, this lament can be seen everywhere in the gloomy comments of the English media after the Lord's result
 yahaan tak ki aam taur par sanyat or kaaphi vidvatapurna tippanee karne vaale mike briyarly ne da times main apane lekh kii shuruyaat stuart broad kii is shikaayat se kii ki, ''batsman diares chaahate the, bowler diares chaahate the, darshak diares chaahate the, lekin chunki bharat diares nahin chahta tha, isliye hamen diares nahin mila
 In the context of the match, it was interesting that the British were complaining about not getting DRS, while the poor umpiring had benefited overall, especially Broad, who was caught out even after hitting the ball from Ajinkya Rahane's arm guard
 Had the benefit of doing
 lekin tathy yah he ki bharat ko diares pasand nahin tha or uske liye niyamon main badlaav kiya gaya
 Briarly had accused India of being stubborn, wrote that now he is approving the DRS to save credibility and wished that! India has to face some bad decisions, so that it comes on the right path
 iconomist ke puraane india corespondent james astill ne da great tamaasha: cricket, karpshan and da tarabulaint rij of modern india main is badhati takat kaa ullekh kiya he
 (disclosure: i conducted a discussion with him and the then BCCI Vice President Arun Jaitley at the book release ceremony at the British Council in New Delhi)
 astill ne kaha he, ''isisi ke anglo-australian vito kanoon, jiskaa kabhi istemaal nahin kiya gaya, ko hataane ke liye dam dikhaakar bisisiai ne khel par apni majboot vittiya pakad kii vajah se apane mutabik chijen kar lee hai
 The result is that India can now elect itself (against whom to play)
 
 
 vah isisi ke kisi bhi samjhaute main apane laayak chhot kii maang bhi kar saktaa he
 "estil then quoted Australian cricket writer Gideon Hague as saying:" This power is more than changing the center
 yah satta kii prakruti badalane jaisaa he
 "if tons of atomic bombs have paved the way for turning the strategic power of a country into an economic force, then tradition and history have been seen to be bowing down to financial strength and audience strength at the height of cricket

 Srinivas is also no idiot
 ve saumy, spasht bolne vaale, cricket ke jaankaar or garmjoshi vaale hai
 Contrary to the gestures of many big-time prime time anchors, he has not come to cricket for money
 haa, ve khel se judi prasiddhi, takat ko pasand karte hai
 They have arrogance, but money is not a reason at all
 unki india cements hameshaa se arabon dollar kii company rahi he or cricket ke liye ve apane kharche par yatra karte hai
 But it is also that his attitude keeps destroying the opponents
 iske bare main lalit modi se puuchhie
 On the day of victory, i met him at his grand dinner at St James's Court in London, where Dhoni, coach Duncan Fletcher and team management were also there
 pipe kaa kash lete hue unhone kaha, ''ham world cap jeet chuke hai, gharelu str par kai siries jite hai, lekin aaj kii jeet kuch khaas he
 "they say that before no one wanted to come to India, we had to give them guaranteed money and still their best players hesitated to come (like Geoffrey Boycott), now they demand to play a long series with us
" bharat ko yahaan pahunchane main 70-80 saal lage hai or abhi use asal mukaam nahin mila he
 In a sense, here is also the interesting contradiction of the same Indian politics , which has ruined our governance, but they are doing excellent work in cricket

 At a reception, i introduced him to my friend's child as the man who has scored the fastest century in Tests so far (madras, 46 balls, against the West Indies in 1966–67)
 faruk thodaa peeche jhuke, apane peeche khadey ek atithi ke kandhe par haath rakhaa or kaha, yahaan vah vyakti bhi aapke saamne he

 "on the day of victory, while moving towards Lord's, Farooq spoke to me about the rise of India, how much the BCCI has done for the former cricketers, how the capital of cricket has now reached India from London and they regret it only
 Is that it is in Chennai, not in Mumbai

 sarkaar jidipi ke base year main badlaav kii taiyaari kar rahi haiske peeche sarkaar kii manshaa ko lekar sawaal khadey hone lage hanvaise base year main badlaav ek saamaanya or jaruri prakriya helekin sarkaar ke jidipi aankadon ko hi andeh se dekha jaataa rahaa haigat 5 november ko yah ghoshnaa kii gai ki neshnal accounts (jidipi) ke liye base year 2011-12 se badalakar 2017-18 kii jaaegi, tabase isko lekar jabardast atakalein shuru ho gai ki aakhir iske peeche sarkaar kii kya manshaa he or iske kya parinaam honge
 One reason for this is that our economy has been in a sluggish phase for the last five quarters
 jidipi growth vitt varsh 2018 kii chauthi timahi main 8
 It has come down from 1 per cent to 5 per cent in the first quarter of FY 2020 and is expected to fall further
 duusare, pichley paanch saal main data kii gunvattta ko lekar kaaphi chaanbin kii ja rahi he, kyonki bharat or videsh ke arthshaastri or export inamen raajnneetik dakhal ko lekar gambhir chintaa jataate rahe hai or yah chaahate hai ki sankhyikeey sansthaaon kii aazaadee or eemaandaaree ko behaal kiya jaae
 Nevertheless, there are several strong reasons for the change in the base year of GDP estimates
 base year main sanshodhan se arthvyavastha ke sanrachanaatmak badlaav ko aanka jaataa habehatar niti nirmaan ke liye base year main sanshodhan anivaary he
 This is done to monitor the structural changes in the economy and to improve or update macroeconomic indicators that reflect the country's economic performance
 bharat ke purv mukhya sankhyikivid tisie anant ne sabase pehle janvari 2018 main isaki baat kii thi
 a note has been issued by the Ministry of Program Implementation and Statistics (mospi) on 8 May 2019 about the kind of change that can be done
 is note main kaha gaya he ki 2011-12 siries ko apnaane ke maamle main bharat ab sanyukt raashtra dwaara viksit 2008 system of neshnal accounts (2008 SNA) jaise naveenatam antarrashtriya maanak ko apnaane kii taraf bad rahaa he, jo ki 1993 ke esene kaa apadet he
 The 2011–12 series included changes to data sources, expanded coverage and improved processes to the new standard, but needed further improvements, particularly to address the flaws in the MCA21 database , By which the output of the corporate sector is measured, and for changes in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP)
 is note main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki bharat ne ab imef ke vishesh data prasar maanak (SDDS) ko bhi apanaaya he
 It says that the 'double deflator' should be adopted in GDP estimates by developing a new price index
 bharat philhal single diflator (jaise CPI, WPI yaa anya) kaa istemaal karata he, jabaki america, australia, canada, france, germany, italy, japan, mexico or brazil ne ab dabl diflator ko apana liya he, jisamen output or input ke liye alag-alag diflator kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Duration of base change of 10 to 5 years There is no set standard for change in base year
 saal 2007-10 ke dauraan bharat ke pehle mukhya sankhyikivid (CSI) or 2013-16 main neshnal statistical kamishan (NSC) ke chairman rahe pranab sen kaa kahana he ki 2008 esene main yah sifarish kii gai he ki vikasshil desh ko har 5 saal par apane base year main badlaav karnaa chahie taaki arthvyavastha main sanrachanaatmak badlaav kaa sahi akalan kiya ja sake
 He said, 'how soon the change will happen depends on how fast the structural changes are happening in the economy
 yadi koi arthvyavastha sthir he to lambey samay tak base year main badlaav kii jarurat nahin he
 Decision will have to be made about it again
 ’bharat ne jab saal 1948-49 main neshnal accounts siries kii shuruyaat kii to sanshodhan har 10 saal main hote the, jo sanyog se janaganana ke samay hi hota tha, kyonki janaganana se kamgaaron kaa sahi aankada mil jaataa tha
 This trend continued until 1980–81
 iske baad saal 1993-94 se bharat ne har paanch saal par hone vaale rojgaar or berogari ke survey ke nateezon ke aadhaar par base year main badlaav shuru kiya
 However, this tradition also broke in 2009-10, as it was not a 'normal year' due to the 2008 global recession
 isliye aglaa base year 2011-12 tay kiya gaya
 After this, the base year should have been changed in 2016-17, but then the change did not happen and information about why it did not come to light
 2017-18 par ham khaas jor isliye de rahe hai, kyonki pichley daur kaa rojgaar survey (PLFS) or kanjumar vyay survey 2017-18 main kiya gaya tha
 The Employment Survey (PLFS) for the year 2017-18 has come and after the first refusal, it was finally released after the 2019 elections
 isamen yah dikhaaya gaya he ki berogari kii dar pichley 45 saal main sabase zyada (6
 1%)
 upabhokta vyay survey abhi tak jari nahin kiya gaya he
 The credibility stakes of statistical data are due to apprehensions about the proposed change in the parabase year because the quality of government data has been doubted
 jidipi ke akalan kii prakriya abhi tak apaardarshee rahi he
 That is why Arvind Subramanian, who was the Chief Economic Advisor to the government from 2014 to 2018 in preparing the Economic Survey, writes in July 2019 that, 'underlying figures are not publicly available, so no person outside the CSO can estimate GDP 
 ' neshnal accounts divijan kaarykram kriyanvayan evam sankhyikeey (mospi) mantralay ke kendriya sankhyikee sanghathan (CSO) kaa hissaa he
 Former NSC chairman PC Monahan says that before the base year of 2011-12, whatever data was used to replace it was publicly available
 in sabamein saal 2015 se badlaav aa gaya, jab base year ko badalakar 2011-12 kar diya gaya
 Structural changes Based on the MCA21 data set with considerable flaws, for the first time in the 2011–12 series, an untested and unknown database of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs was used
 isamen menuphaccharing or sarvice sector kii corporate companiyon ke utpaadan kaa akalan karne kii baat kahi jaati he
 This is due to the major change in the manufacturing and services structural share in the 2011-12 series
 neeche tulanaatmak varshon main 2004-05 or 2011-12 ke siries kaa istemaal karte hue aap iskaa asar dekh sakate hai
 The share of manufacturing in this has increased quite rapidly (14
 9 fisadi se vitt varsh 2014 main badhkar 17
 2 per cent) and the share of the service sector has fallen sharply (67
 4 fisadi se vitt varsh 2014 main 59
 9 percent)
 MCA21 ko aaj bhi saarvajanik nahin kiya gaya he
 However, when the NSSO published its 'technical Report on Services Sector Enterprises in India' on the MCA21 dataset in April 2019, economists and everyone else were shocked by its revelations
 isamen kaha gaya he, ‘emsie kii kareeb 45 fisadi ikaiyaan survey se baahar thim, jabaki isi / biaar frem main aise 18 fisadi cese the

 When the 2011-12 series was released in 2015, it was reported that India's GDP growth exceeded that of China
 isse pehali baar arthshaastriyon ke man main andeh panpa jo jidipi or anya sanketakon ke bich asantulan kii baat kar rahe the
 After this a further suspicion arose when the back series data was released in November 2018, almost four years later
 iske pehle khulkar drama saamne aayaa
 NITI Aayog rejected two earlier amendments which showed that there was a sharp increase in GDP during the UPA regime, while the truth is that NITI Aayog has no expertise in this matter
 niti ayog ne aakhirkaar jab back siries ko jari karne kii ijaajat di, to uske baad mospi dastavejon se nimna graph banataa he, jisase yah pataa chalata he ki kis tarah kis tarah se usamen upie sarkaar ke jidipi aankadon ko kam karke dikhaaya gaya he
 The post-demonetisation and post-gst GDP figures were raised, followed by a revision in the GDP figures a day before the budget was presented on February 1, 2019
 notebandi ke saal yani vitt varsh 2017 main jidipi growth ke aankade ko 7
 Increased from 1 per cent to 8
 2 fisadi kar diya gaya, jo ki dashak main sabase zyada he, or jiesti lagu hone vaale saal yani vitt varsh 2018 ke liye jidip growth ke aankade ko 6
 Increased from 7 per cent to 7
 2 fisadi kar diya gaya
 In one of his books of 2018, Subramanian explains how demonetisation and GST were like double shocks and how the economy suffered heavily
 notebandi ke bare main vah likhte hai, ‘notebandi ek vyapak, gambhir, maudrik jhatka tha’ jisaki vajah se agali 7-8 timahiyon main jidipi main giravat dekhi gai
 In June 2019, Subramanian wrote a paper for Harvard University stating that India's growth estimate was about 2 between 2011-12 to 2016-17
 5 fisadi badhaakar dikhaaya gaya
 The attack had only just cooled down, in another paper, Subramanian shot another ballot, stating, 'the underlying figures are not publicly available, so no one outside the CSO can' estimate GDP ' 
 'base year main badlaav ke bare main kya kehete hai expartsen kehete hai ki saal 2017-18 ko base year chunanaa acha nahin he, kyonki yah ek ‘saamaanya varsh’ nahin tha or isse behatar 2018-19 ko chunanaa ho saktaa he
 He says this is because the year 2017-18 faced two major economic setbacks - demonetisation was announced in November 2016 and GST was implemented in July 2017

 The employment data shows that 2017-18 is considered to be a very poor year in this case (unemployment rate 6
 1 fisadi) or doosraa aankada bhi shaayad acha nahin he (ise abhi tak saarvajanik nahin kiya gaya he)rigerv bank ke purv governor mohanan or si
 Rangarajan also believes that the year 2017-18 is not a normal year, as demonetisation and GST were affected that year
 rangarajan ne kaha ki sarkaar yadi 2017-18 jaise kam aamadani vaale saal ko chunati he to mushkil main pad sakati he
 Mohanan said that his main concern is about MCA21, in which the share of manufacturing GDP has been significantly increased and the share of service GDP has been reduced
 yah dataset abhi tak saarvajanik nahin hua he or isaki gunvattta ke bare main april 2019 ke eneseso report main jo sawaal uthaae gaye the uskaa samaadhaan karnaa chahie or isko phir se istemaal karne se pehle tamaam export ko santusht karnaa chahie

 yediurppa ne yah daawa bhi kiya ki unase istipha dene ke liye nahin kaha gaya he

 He believes that it is because of Yeddyurappa's resignation that the party is not able to fully engulf the government in Parliament on the 2G spectrum scam, Adarsh housing Society and corruption issues in the Commonwealth Games

 uk Mamta Banerjee asked why Gujarati is only in JEE exam? Modi government told that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee did exam for Joint Entrance Examination (JEE Main) examination to be held for admission in reputed engineering institutions Questions have been asked by the Modi government regarding the language
 darasal jeii main pariksha kaa aayojan hindi or angreji bhashaaon main kiya jaataa rahaa he
 At the same time, Gujarati language will be included as an alternate language with hindi-english in the JEE Main examination to be held from next year
 Our country is India, which is home to so many religions, cultures, languages, creeds and communities
 However, maligning all regions and regional languages is the intention of the government at the center
 (1 / 4)— Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial)november 6, 2019aise main mamata banerjee ne sawaal poochhate hue twit kiya, 'mujhe gujarati bhashaa bahut pasand he
 But why are other regional languages ignored in the exam? If the examination can be conducted in Gujarati, then why not the regional language including Bengali language? "surprisingly, JEE Main exam is written in Hindi and English, while only Gujarati language was added as an option
" ye kadam saraahneey nahin he
 Joint Entrance Exams so long were conducted in English and Hindi languages
 Surprisingly, now only Gujarati language has been added
 Such a step is not at all praiseworthy
 (2 / 4)— Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial)november 6, 2019unhone kaha hamaara desh bharat bahut saare dharmon, samskritiyon, bhashaaon, panthon or samudaayon kaa ghar he
 However, it is the intention of the government at the Center to spoil the image of all regions and regional languages
 unhone likhaa aisa karnaa thik nahin he
 Because later on this issue there can be vigorous protests
 kyonki is kaaran anya kshetreey bhashaaon ko bolne vaale logon kii bhaawanaaon ko gahari thes pahonchegi
 According to the news agency PTI, in 2014, the Central Board of Secondary Education added Urdu, Marathi and Gujarati to the JEE Main Examination
 haalanki, 2016 main, isane marathi or urdu ko hataa diya tha jiske baad keval gujarati bhashaa rahane diya tha
 When the responsibility of entrance examination from CBSE was given to the National Testing Agency (NTA) in 2019
 Unless this issue is decided gracefully, there will be strong protests all around as sentiments of people who speak other regional languages would be deeply hurt due to this injustice
 (4 / 4) - Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial) November 6, 2019 After that the JEE Main examination started being conducted in Hindi and English
 is baat kii jaankaree trinmul congress ke adhyaksh twit kar di gai thi
 Surprisingly, now only Gujarati language has been added
 aisa kadam bilkul bhi saraahneey nahin he
 Let me tell you, while advising the Modi government, Mamta Banerjee said that if the matter is not taken care of, "strong opposition" can start everywhere in the country
 unhone kaha ki bharat kai bhashaaon, samskritiyon or dharmon kaa ghar he, lekin centre main sarkaar kii manshaa sabhi kshetron or kshetreey bhashaaon ko badnaam karnaa he
 Let us tell you, the concerned Department of JEE Main Examination has clarified that the examination included those languages in which the language was ever requested by the states

 rail mantri ne kaha ki railway ko behatar sthiti main laane kaa ham par dabaav bana hua he, lekin mujhe is samay, hamaare purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ji kii kuch panktiyaan yaad aa rahi hai jinhone kaha tha : vipadaaen aati hai aaen, ham na rukenge , ham na rukenge, aghaton kii kya chintaa he? ham na jhukenge , ham na jhukenge

 rail mantri ne phir se vaajapeyi ji ko yaad karte hue kaha : jab tak dhyey puraa na hoga, tab tak pag kii gati na rukegi, aaj kahe chaahe kuch duniya, kal ko bina jhuke na rahegi
 The comments suresh prabhu ne apana bajet bhaashan samaapt karte hue bhagwaan buddha kaa samaran kiya or kaha ki bhagwaan buddha ne kaha he ki jab bhi koi vyakti yatra karata he to vah do galtiyaan kar saktaa he : pehali yatra shuru hi na kare or duusari safar puraa na kare

 team india ke liye ye sab ab isisi ke anti karpshan unit ke adhikari hi tay kar rahe hai
 The reason is that the players have also been asked to give their local numbers in England
 unhen england main apane parichiton kii jaankaree bhi in adhikariyon ko deni he
 Who will come to meet them, to whom they will pass the match
 ye tamaam jaankaree khilaadiyon ko pehle se hi in adhikariyon ko muhaiyyaa karaani hogi
 Obviously in such a situation it would not be wrong to say that Team India is under house arrest
 guuruuvaar ko birmigham main barish kii vajah se team india kaa practice seshan pani main dhul gaya
 At the same time, the chance of captain Dhoni was also lost that he would be able to draw the attention of the team going through the difficult period, and share his strategy with the players with the tournament
 khayr team ne gym main hi kareeb do ghante halki-phulki kasarat kii
 However, the players were allowed to have lunch outside the ACU officials
 team ke liye ye halaat behad mushkil bhare hai
 Captain Dhoni thought it would be that the team outside the country will get a chance to freshen up, and the players will only think about cricket
 lekin saat samandar paar bhi phixing kaa saaya team ke peeche padaa he
 Fans from all over the country and the world have an eye on Team India and they are not used to the way this team is under house arrest there
 saal 2000 main jab phixing ke saae se team india gujri thi, tab maujuuda team kaa koi khilaadi us dressing room main nahin tha
 In such a situation, now everything captain Dhoni comes
 najaron ke sangeen saae main unhen england kii jang ladani he or jeetni he
 Only then will the eyes of the world be removed from the team and salute him
 england main champions trophy khilne gaye bharat ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ne ek baar phir match phixing par kuch nahin kaha
 However this time he definitely said that when the time comes, i will definitely say something
 dhoni ne kaha ki har seoup main kamjor log maujuud rahete hai
 In the press conference, Dhoni revealed the team's strategy and said that the Indian team will play 5 bowlers in England
 dhoni ne bharosa jataayaa ki england ke maahaul main ravindra jadeja safal honge
 However, he made it clear that he had options for Jadeja
 dhoni ne kaha ki champion trophy main bhartiya team murali vijay or shikhar dhawan se hi pari kii shuruyaat karaayegi
 He said that Rohit Sharma will be retained as the third opener
 dhoni ne saaf kiya kii dinesh karthik ko middle order me hi rakhaa jayega
 Also Dhoni admitted that Team India does not perform well immediately after the IPL but he also said that it would be wrong to blame the IPL for this
 birmigham main guuruuvaar ko team india kaa practice seshan barish main dhul gaya or khilaadiyon ne gym main hi pasinaa bahaya
 Team India is scheduled to play their first practice match against Sri Lanka on 1 June, while the tournament is going to start from 6 June and Team India will play in the first match with South Africa
 aatankwaad ke mudde par america or pakistan ke bich chal rahi khinchataan ke baad ab donon deshon ke rajanyik sambandhon par bhi sankat dikhaai de rahaa he
 On one hand, Pakistan is engaged in the process of imposing a ban on the American officer accused of a road accident in Islamabad
 vahiin, ab khabar ye he ki america bhi apane desh main maujuud pakistani adhikariyon par sakhti badha saktaa he or unki awajahi par pabandi laga saktaa he
 According to Pakistani media, the Trump administration has spoken to Pakistan in this regard and warned that if their officials in Pakistan are not relieved of the ban, they can be treated similarly to their diplomats in Washington
 40 kilometre se baahar jane kii ijaajat nahibataya ja rahaa he ki america main maujuud kisi bhi pakistani rajanyik ko 25 mile yani kareeb 40 kilometre ke daayre se zyada kaa safar karne ke liye america prashasan se anumati leni padegi
 To go on such a trip, diplomats must inform the US administration at least five days in advance
 1 may se lagu ho saktaa he pratibandhhalanki, america adhikari is kadam ko haal ke accident se jodakar nahin dekh rahe hai
 It is being said that this issue has been discussed between the two countries a few weeks ago
 america adhikariyon kaa ye bhi daawa he ki is aadesh kaa haalia sadak haadase se koi vaasta nahin he
 It is being told that this ban on Pakistani officials in the US will come into force from May 1
 sadak haadase main hui thi ek mautadrasal, islamabad main america duutavas ke joseph emenual kii tej raftaar land kruger se bike ko takkar lagi thi
 Two people were riding on the bike, one of whom died during treatment
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki pakistan main america rajanyik ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaaya ja saktaa he
 Also, to prevent him from going out of the country, Pakistan has also included his name in the 'exit Control List'
 jisase wo bina ijaajat desh se baahar nahin ja sakenge
 Let me tell you that since Donald Trump has taken command of America, he has started doing acts of Pakistan
 aatankwaad ko panaah dene kii hath na chhodane par america pakistan kii aarthik madad bhi kaaphi kam kar chukaa he
 In such a situation, this step of America to curb diplomats is being considered as another big blow for Pakistan

 The Supreme Court asked how a guilty person can be an official of a political party and how he can select a candidate for elections as it is contrary to the spirit of one of his decisions to ensure the 'purity' of elections
 sheersh adaalat ek janhit yachika par sunwaayee kar rahi thi jisamen doshiyon par raajnneetik dal banane tathaa usamen padaadhikari banane se jab tak roak lagane kaa anurodh kiya gaya tha jab tak ve chunaav sambandhi kanoon ke tahat ayogy hai
 The Supreme Court raised the question and asked the central government that if a person cannot contest elections then how can he form any political party? Also, how can he choose the party candidate to contest the election? It is a very different situation that a person cannot contest elections but he can select candidates to contest elections by forming a political party
 aise log agar skool yaa koi duusari sanstha banaate hai to koi samasya nahin he lekin wo ek party bana rahe hai jo sarkaar chalaaegi, ye matter karata he
 The Chief Justice said that it is against the decisions given by the Supreme Court on corruption that have been given to maintain sanctity in elections
 supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko do hafte main jawaab dene ko kaha
 The Supreme Court will now hear the matter on 26 March
 supreme court aapraadhik maamle main doshi tehraae jane waalon ko raajnneetik dal banane yaa dal kaa padaadhikari banane par roak kii yachika par sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 The Election Commission has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court
 chunaav ayog ne aapraadhik maamalon main doshi tehraae jane waalon ko raajnneetik dal banane yaa dal kaa padaadhikari banane par roak lagane vaali yachika kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki uske paas raajnneetik dalon kaa panjikaran radd karne kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 By filing an affidavit in the Supreme Court, the Commission has said that it has been writing a letter to the Central Government for the last nearly 20 years, requesting that it should also be empowered to cancel the registration of political parties but till now it has not been successful
 ayog ne kaha he ki jan pratinidhi adhinium kii dhara-29 e main use raajnneetik dalon ko panjikaran karne kaa to adhikaar diya gaya he lekin is dal ke panjikaran ko radd karne kaa adhikaar nahin diya gaya he
 The Commission said that for the first time in 1998, the Chief Election Commissioner wrote a letter to the then Law Minister, stating that the Commission should be empowered to cancel the registration of political parties
 ayog kaa kahana tha ki kai raajnneetik dal aise hai jinhone panjikaran to karvaa liya he lekin kabhi chunaav main hissaa nahin liya
 Such parties are only on paper
 tippaniyan The Commission says that the purpose of forming such a party can also be to take advantage of the Income Tax Act
 ayog ne kaha ki farvari 2016 se disambar, 2016 ke bich is tarah ke 255 raajnneetik dalon ko panjikrut kiye gaye gaiyr manyata praapt raajnneetik dalon kii suchi se baahar kar diya gaya
 In the affidavit, the commission also said that it had been supportive of the demand for Inner Party Democracy
 haalanki ayog ne yah saaf kiya ki vidhayika ko kanoon main sanshodhan kar ayog ko inner party demokrasi ke sambandh main dishanirdesh banane kaa adhikaar diya jaae
 It is known that at present the Commission has the right to register a political party but does not have the right to cancel its registration
 chunaav ayog ne yah jawaab bhaajapa netaa ashvini upaadhyaay kii yachika par diya he
 The petition calls for banning those convicted in a criminal case from forming a political party or becoming party officials
 supreme court ne sawaal uthaate hue centre sarkaar se poocha ki agar koi vyakti chunaav nahi lard saktaa to wo koi bhi raajnneetik party kaise bana saktaa he? saath hi wo party ke ummidavaar ko chunaav ladane ke liye kaise chun saktaa he? ye badi alag sthiti he ki koi vyakti chunaav to nahin lard saktaa lekin wo raajnneetik party bana kar chunaav ladane ke liye ummidavaaron kaa chayan kar saktaa he
 If such people build a school or any other institution, then there is no problem, but they are forming a party that will run the government, this matter
 ' chif justise ne kaha ki ye supreme court ke bhrashtachar ko lekar die gaye faislon ke khilaaf he jo chunaav main pavitrataa banaae rakhane ke liye die gaye hai
 The Supreme Court asked the central government to reply in two weeks
 supreme court ab is maamle par 26 march ko sunwaayee karegaa
 The Supreme Court is hearing a plea to stop those convicted in a criminal case to form a political party or to become party officials
 chunaav ayog ne supreme court main halafanama daakhil kiya he
 The Election Commission supported the plea prohibiting those convicted in criminal cases to form political parties or party officials, saying it should have the authority to cancel the registration of political parties
 supreme court main halafanama daayar kar ayog ne kaha he vah pichley kareeb 20 varshon se centre sarkaar ko patr likhakar yah aagrah karata rahaa he ki use raajnneetik dalon kaa panjikaran radd karne kaa bhi adhikaar diya jaae lekin ab tak use safalataa nahin mili he
 The Commission has said that in Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, it has been given the right to register political parties but it has not been given the right to cancel the registration of this party
 ayog ne kaha ki 1998 main pehali baar mukhya nirvachan ayukta ne tatkaaleen kanoon mantri ko patr likhakar kaha tha ki ayog ko raajnneetik dalon kaa panjikaran radd karne kaa adhikaar milanaa chahie
 The Commission said that there are many political parties who have got registered but never participated in the elections
 is tarah kii partiyaan sirf kaagajon par he
 The comments ayog kaa kahana he ki is tarah kii party banane kaa makasad iskar adhinium kaa phayda uthaane kaa bhi ho saktaa he
 The Commission said that between February 2016 and December 2016, 255 such political parties were excluded from the list of unrecognized political parties
 halafname main ayog ne yah bhi kaha ki vah inner party demokrasi kii maang kaa samarthan karata rahaa he
 However, the Commission made it clear that the Legislature should amend the law and give the Commission the authority to make guidelines regarding Inner Party Democracy
 maaloom ho ki philhal ayog ko raajnneetik dal ko panjikrut karne kaa to adhikaar he lekin uskaa panjikaran radd karne kaa adhikaar nahin he

 kutiyaa main bulaakar rape kaa arongale din jab peedita ke mata pita chhindwara gurukul pahunche
 He was told that his daughter is possessed by ghosts
 ise asaram hi thik kar sakate hai
 On August 14, the victim's family reached Asaram's Jodhpur ashram
 15 agast kii shaam ko peedita ko thik karne ke bahaane se asaram ne use apni kutiyaa main bulaakar rape kiya
 After the case was lodged in Delhi, the whole family returned home, so on August 17, the girl told the whole thing to her family

 Thus 16 days later, Asaram was arrested from the Indore ashram

 In response to the question of hanging the political stethoscope around the neck, instead of becoming a doctor, Shehnaaz said - "people who understand and treat the merge of patients are enough but the pain of the country is much more than physical suffering
" adhikansh log raajnneeti main paisa kamaane ke liye aate hai lekin meraa makasad ye bilkul bhi nahin he
 Since childhood, i have felt the pain in my village and countryside very closely
 parivaar, pados, gaanv, ilaake or desh ko tarakkee ke raste par le jane ke padhai jaruri thi
 i completed it with an MBBS degree
 ab jindagi kaa makasad apane gaanv or ilaake ko vikaas kii patari par laakar li se alag hatakar kuch aisa karne kaa he, jise dekhakar mere ilaake ke log mujh par fakhr karen or duusare log anusaran karen

 Unemployed people are moving into the abyss of crime
 aise main sabase pehali jarurat he-dehaat main kutir udyogon ke srijan kii
 Along with government schemes, i personally will start cottage business in singles and groups and try to stop the migration as soon as possible
 ''shahanaz kahati hai ki yahaan har ghar main shauchalay hai

 Therefore, she has come in the political corridors with the culinary purpose of implementing the mission of better education and good health
 unhone bataaya yahaan aisa ek bhi ghar nahin he jisamen se nikalakar bacchiyaan skool nahin jaati hon
 Shahnaz, who gave new appearance and appearance to the Gadhazan Gram Panchayat, said in response to a question - "yes! Why not? If people of my constituency want to, i will definitely try my luck in future elections

 On the other hand, Mayawati hit back at BJP President Amit Shah's comment on 'noor descending' on demonetisation, saying that Noor is not his, but the face of Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been removed because the people of the country are facing a lot of difficulties due to demonetization

 It happened after the shooting

 It was decided to project Harshvardhan
 aapako bataa den ki isi saal farvari maheene main bijepi ne vijay goyal ko dilli ikai kaa adhyaksh banaaya tha
 During his 8-month tenure, there was large-scale factionalism and internal uproar within the party, due to which the BJP could not emerge as the only alternative to the ruling Congress
 vijay goyal kaa prayog fail hone ke baad, aisa lagata he ki bijepi ne maan liya he ki dilli jaise shahari kendron main party kaa netritv karne vaale ummidavaar kii chhavi sabase ahm he or iske alaava vijay goyal party kaaryakartaaon ke andar utsaah bharne main bhi naakaam rahe hai

 Before this meeting it was hoped that a decision could be taken to bring petrol and diesel under the purview of GST
 real estate ko bhi iske daayre main liye jane kaa bhi sab log intjaar kar rahe the, lekin in donon morchon par koi faisla nahin ho sakaa
 The price of unadulterated petrol and diesel continues to rise
 shuukravaar ko mumbai main ek litre petrol kii keemat 79
 Has reached 58
 vahiin, dijal bhi yahaan 66 rupee ke paar pahunch chukaa he
 After this increase, it was expected that petrol and diesel would be brought under the purview of GST, but it was neither discussed nor any decision could be taken
 ye he penchadrasal petrol ordijal ko jiestike daayre main laane ke liye sabhi rajyon kii sahmati jaruri he
 At present, not all states are ready for this
 isaki ek ahm vajah he rajasav
 The sale of petrol and diesel brings in a lot of revenue to the states
 yah rajasav unhen dijal or petrol par waite ke jariye miltaa he
 If both these fuels are brought under the purview of GST, the excise duty levied by the Center and the VAT of the states will be abolished
 jiesti ke tahat adhiktam 28 fisadi tex lagaaya ja sakegaa
 Because this is currently the highest rate in the new tax policy
 isse petrol or dijal kii keemten 50 rupee se bhi kam ho jaaengi
 Objections to the states, even if the common man gets relief, but the states may have to suffer a big loss in revenue
 yahi vajah he ki sabhi rajya iske liye apni sahmati dene main samay laga rahe hai
 But the decision will be soon, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told after the meeting of the GST Council that even though all the states are not ready for it at present, the Congress is ready to bring petrol and diesel under GST
 isse raah thodi aasaan ho jaaegi
 He hoped that a decision could be taken in the next meeting of the council
 real estate ko lekar charchaa lekin faisla nahinvahin, real estate kii baat karen, to isko lekar parishad kii 25veen baithak main charchaa hui
 However, no decision could be taken on bringing it under the purview of GST
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne bataaya ki rajyon ne ise bhi jiesti ke daayre main laane kaa virodh kiya he
 Because of this, no decision could be made about this
 ab agali baithak par najaravitt mantri nekaha ki acchhee baat ye he ki congress petrol-dijal kii tarah hi real estate ko bhi jiesti ke daayre main laane par raji he
 This will make it easier to take a decision on this front in the next meeting
 unhone kaha ki petrol-dijal or real estate ko lekar agali baithak main koi antim faisla ho saktaa he
 Every woman wants her hair to be soft and shiny
 bal chahen chote hon yaa lambey, street ho yaa karli; persenality par gahari chhap daalate hai
 The outermost layer of hair contains natural oil which locks the natural moisturizer of the hair
 isi kii vajah se baalo main chamak rahati he or wo mulaayam bhi rahete hai
 When this layer deteriorates, the hair becomes lifeless and dry
 is layer ke damege hone kii kai vajahen ho sakati hai
 Many times, due to lack of adequate nutrition, use of harsh soaps or shampoos, not having a good conditioner or staying in too much sunlight, the hair gets spoiled
 kai baar iske liye badhati umr or tanaav bhi kaaran hote hai
 However, getting good hair is not so difficult
 thode se prayaas se baalo ko komal or mulaayam banaaya ja saktaa he
 1
 baalo ko mulaayam banane or unamem chamak laane ke liye andey se behatar kuch bhi nahin
 It is so effective that you will see a difference in one go
 isamen paryaapt maatra main protein, fatty acids or lactin hota he, jo baalo kii marammat karata he
 Mixing olive oil in it will help more
 2
 Beer works like a great hair tonic
 isamen paae jane vaale protein baalo ko repere karke unhen poshan pradaan karte hai, jisase baalo kii khoi chamak waapas aa jaati he
 3
 nariyal ke tel main wo sabhi poshak tatv maujuud hote hai jo baalo ko mulaayam or chamakdaar banane ke liye chahie hote hai
 It maintains the natural moisture of the hair and does not allow them to become dry, making them shiny
 4
 Honey can also be an effective remedy
 baalo kii khoi chamak waapas paane ke liye aap shahad kaa bhi istemaal kar sakati hai
 This not only gives shine to the hair, but also makes the hair soft
 5
 Aloe vera is also very beneficial for hair
 ye baalo ko puri nami dene ke saath hi poshit karne kaa kaam bhi karata he
 The antioxidants and vitamins present in it serve to nourish the hair
 saath hi ye roosi ko bhi kam karne main kargar he

 Sarabjit was stunned for almost a week due to the barbaric attack of prisoners in Pakistan's Kot Lakhpat Jail
 videshmantri salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki vah sarbajit singh kii maut se kaaphi acroshit hai
 At the same time, former police officer and social worker Kiran Bedi said that the incident of the death of Indian prisoner Sarabjit in Pakistan could have been prevented

 Indian intelligence agencies have achieved great success by busting a call center of Pakistani intelligence agency ISI which was used to trap the soldiers and officers of the Indian Army and security forces in the honeytrap
 yah kol centre islamabad se 116 kilometre dur jhelum shahar main he
 The company that runs this call center is none other than Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL)
 inter-services intelegence (iesai) ke sahyog se chalane vaala yah kol centre bhartiya sim card kaa istemaal karata tha
 These were the same SIM cards which were confiscated by the Pakistani Customs Department at the border from the people of India, especially women, who went to Pakistan to visit their relatives
 is sanisanikhej hanitrap ke silsile main dilli police ke saath-saath kuch anya rajyon kii police ne jab deshvyapee jaanch shuru kii to aise 100 se zyada sim cardo kaa pataa chalaa
 The SIM card seized from Indian women traveling to Pakistan is used to hide the identities of Pakistani women working in call centers across the border
 bhartiya sim card ke jariye sangeeta mishra, aaysha raay, nita singh jaise naamon se fasebuk par farji bhartiya idi banaae gaye the
 The girls working in this call center of Jhelum were specially trained to speak Hindi in fluency
 iesai ke gurgon kii madad se ye ladkiyaan pehle soshal media platformon par bhartiya suraksha balon ke javaanon va adhikariyon kii talash karti thim or baad main unase sampark sthapit karti thim
 After starting the chat, these girls used to record video calls on Facebook
 uske baad ye ladkiyaan whatsap par unase kuch zyada hi antarang baaten karne lagati thim
 Indian officials felt that they talked to Indian girls and were thus caught in a honeytrap through ISI call centers
 dilli police ke sutron ne ieenes ko bataaya ki is baat kaa khulaasa tab hua jab guptcharon ne dilli kii ek mahila se poochtacha kii
 The woman must have been only a few years older than 30
 usne bataaya ki vah jab pakistan gai thi tab pakistani custom vibhaag ne usase uskaa sim card or phone donon jabt kar liya tha
 Sources said, "during the investigation, it was found that only Delhi's mobile and its SIM card are being used in the call center of PTCL operated by ISI in Jhelum city
 " police adhikari ne kaha, "mahila kii baton se is baat kaa bhi khulaasa hua ki pakistani adhikari jis bhartiya mobile phone yaa sim card ke upyog par roak kii baat karke phone va sim jabt karte hai, usee sim card va phone kaa istemaal pakistan kii dharti par ho rahaa he
 "sources said that initially the Army Intelligence Department ie Military Intelligence got a glimpse of it when some officers of the Indian Security Force got caught in such a scandal on Facebook and other social media platforms
 baad main jab bhartiya mobile numberon ko trek kiya gaya or bharat main sim card ke maalikon kaa pataa chalaa tab jaakar khufia agenciyon ko iesai dwaara bhartiya adhikariyon par dore daalane ke is karatuut kii jaankaree mili
 Sources said that in the same year, Uttar Pradesh anti-terrorist Squad (ATS) detected 125 fake ids of women on Facebook which were used by ISI to trap Indian paramilitary forces and army officials in honeytrap
 intelegence beuro (ibi) or military agency ne farji acount kaa data aties se saajha kiya tha
 Indian agencies shared their data with police from other states after the brahmos aerospace engineer Nishant Aggarwal and BSF jawan Achyutanand Mishra were implicated in the honeytrap by ISI in October last year
 sutron ne bataaya ki pakistani ladakiyon ne fasebuk or whatsap ke jariye bhartiya suraksha balon ke kai anya javaanon va adhikariyon ko bhi phuslaaya he
 Like the Uttar Pradesh ATS, the Delhi Police is scouting the Facebook accounts of hundreds of girls who were involved in the Friendly list of Indian security forces who trained and worked for them from the ISI
 chhattisgarh main chunaav kareeb aate hi jangalon se satee ek badi aabaadi ko sarkaar ne khush kar diya he
 People here were troubled by the monkeys because a case was registered under the Animal Atrocities Act against them for harming the monkeys
 logon kii pareshaani ko dekhte hue sarkaar ne bandaron kii nasbandi kaa faisla kiya
 For this, a hospital is also planned to be opened in Surguja Division
 is kavayad ke baad ab bandar ke kaatane par van vibhaag ne muaavja dene kaa elaan kiya he
 For the first time in the state, compensation has been made for monkey bites, so that not only the forested population but also the people of urban areas can breathe relief
 bandaron ke maarane or kaatane par milegaa muaavjaavan vibhaag ne elaan kiya he ki bandar ke kaatane par yadi kisi vyakti kii maut hoti he to uske parivaar ko guzar basar ke liye 4 lakh 78 hajaar rupemuaavja diya jayega
 Two lakh rupees will be given as compensation for monkey attack and Rs 59 thousand if injured
 iske saath hi yadi bandar paaltu jaanwaron yaa maweshiyon ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai to uske maalik ko tees hajaar rupee dene kaa nirnay van vibhaag ne liya he
 Explain that till now the list of wild life in wild animals was a provision for compensation for the attack of animals recorded in the forest
 isamen sher, bhaaluu, hathi or tendua shaamil hai
 Significantly, a large part of the state is forested and the number of monkeys in the forest is high
 bandaron ke aatank se trast he rajya kii aabaadiraipur samet dhamtari, mahasamund, bilaspur, raigarh, korba, ambikapur, jashpur, surajpur, balrampur or baikunthpur ke kai gaanv kasbon main bandar aatank kaa paryaay ban gaye hai
 Many monkeys have become so aggressive that they kill and bite humans during an attack
 hamale se ghayal vyakti ke sharir main rabies kii beemaari teji se failati he
 According to doctors, the effect of rabies due to monkey bites is much faster than rabies caused by dog bites
 isse prabhavit vyakti kii maut tak ho jaati he
 According to doctors, many people have been killed by the bite of monkeys, in many cases, delayed treatment does not prove to be effective and the patient dies
 jabaki kute ke kaatane se failaa rabies kuch had tak niyantrit ho jaataa he
 Recently, a total of 47 people were hanged in the Arang, Abhanpur, Dharsinwa and Mandir Hasaud areas adjacent to Raipur

 Some people have also died during treatment
 sarkari afasaron ne jab in ilaakon kaa daura kiya or halaat se waakif hue tab jaakar van vibhaag peediton ko muaavja dene ke liye taiyaar hua
 According to Pandit Ajay Mishra, who studies on wild animal and wild animal imports, the occurrence of monkeys is the main reason for the attack and presence of monkeys in populated areas along with lack of flowering plants in the forests
 unke mutabik chhattisgarh main lagaataar teen varshon se sookhaa padane or ausat se kam barish hone ke chalate jangalon main faldaar paudhon kii kami ai he
 State Forest Minister Mahesh Gagda expressed happiness that he will get relief from the financial assistance to the victims
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki aane vaale dinon main bandaron ko niyantrit karne ke prayaason main teji laai jaaegi
 Shyram Gurjar of Rajasthan, who was martyred on Monday in an encounter with the mastermind of terror attack and his associates in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, was given a final farewell today on Tuesday
 rajkeey sammaan or deshbhakti naaron ke saath jhunjhunu jile ke paas unke gaanv main antim sanskaar kiya gaya
 The 4-year-old son of martyr Sheoram Gurjar lit him
 mangalvaar subah jab shahid kaa parthiv sharir unke gaanv pahunchaa to sena or police ne guard of honor diya
 As long as the sun will remain moon, Shyram will be your name, as the whole village resonated with slogans and every eye became moist
 vahiin shahid shyoram ke chote bhai bhi sena main hai, unhone kaha ki hamen apane bhai kii shahadat par garv he, kyonki hamaare bhai ne 40 javaanon ko maarane kii sajeesh karne waalon ko khatm kiya he
 Bhai Roopchand said that the elder brother has the grief to be martyred, but we are proud of his martyrdom of the 40 mothers whose lap terrorists heard that the brother has been martyred to kill those terrorists
 bataa den ki shahid kii patni garbhvatee hai, jinaki march main delivery honi he
 Hearing the news of the husband's martyrdom, the wife's health deteriorated after which she was rushed to the hospital by ambulance
 shahid shyoram teen bhaaiyon main sabase bade the or unhone apane chote bhai ko padhaa likhaakar sena main bhartee karaayaa tha
 The people of the village say that the sacrifice of Sheoram Gurjar should not go in vain and the government should take revenge from Pakistan
 shyoram ke pita ke nidhan ke baad unki maa ne padhaa likaakar apane bete kaa paalan poshan karke army main bhartee karaayaa tha
 Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot expressed condolences by tweeting
 unhone kaha ki pulavama main aatankwaadiyon se muthbhed main hamaare bahadur sainikon ne desh ke liye apane praan nyochhavar kar veerta kii misaal kaayam kii he

 But how should he speak to Sachin
 lekin pakistan ke khilaaf is mukaable main jab ganguli or sachin krij par pahunche, to dada pehle jaakar non strike and par khadey ho gaye

 However, the US President did not reveal where and under what circumstances Hamza died

 Trump, however, refused to confirm those reports
 'neuyork times' ke anusaar uski aayu 30 saal se adhik nahin thi
 Hamza's last known public statement was released in 2018 by al Qaeda's media arm

 ) Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien is retiring in July this year and this will be the first time in 41 years that the post of Deputy Chairman can go through the account of the Congress Party
 saal 1977 se ucch sadan main congress party ke netaa sadan main upasabhapati kaa pad sambhaal rahe hai
 Ramnivas Mirdha joined this post in 1977, and since then all the Deputy Presidents have been from the Congress party
 pehali baar jab 2002 main bijepi netabherosingh shekhavatuparashtrapati bane the tab bhi yah silsilaa jari rahaa or congress party ke netaa ne hi upasabhapati kaa pad sambhala tha
 The vice-president is also the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa ne bataaya ki sansad main loksabhaa spikar, dipti spikar or rajyasabha main sabhapati kaa pad pehle hi congress ke haathon se ja chukaa he or ab upasabhapati pad bhi kisi anya dal ke netaa ko diya ja saktaa he
 The senior BJP leader said that this would be the first time that there would be no Congress leader in all the four high posts of Parliament
 'endie ke liye rajyasabha main courian kii jagah apane kisi netaa ko baithaana mushkil hoga kyonki ucch sadan main gathbandhan ke paas itnaa sankhyabal nahin he
 Usually, if the leader elected by the ruling party is elected as the chairman, then the post of deputy chairman is given to the candidate of the opposition
 saal 2004 kii upie sarkaar main bhi bijepi ke charanjit singh attawal ko dipti spikar chunaa gaya tha or 2009 main bhi kariya munda ko is pad ke liye chunaa gaya tha
 Experts believe that the BJP can elect a non-bjp-non-congress MP for the post of Deputy Chairman
 saal 2014 main congress ke inkaar ke baad AIADMK saansad ko loksabhaa main dipti spikar kaa pad diya gaya tha
 Opposition leaders say that in view of the 2019 election, the BJP may select the Deputy Chairman in order to woo allies and other parties
 loksabhaa main AIADMK saansad em thambidurai ko dipti spikar kaa pad dena unki party se dosti kii ore ishaara karata he
 Apart from an ally in the Rajya Sabha, the BJP also needs other parties
 is upasabhapati ke pad par kisi netaa kaa chayan bhi inhen sab sthitiyon ko dekhte hue kiya ja saktaa he
 Irfan Pathan is still the Sultan of Swing
 vaise wo sawaalon ke jawaab bhi sidhe balle se dene main maahir hai, iskaa muzahiraa unhone pakistani ladki ke sawaalon ke jawaab main saalon pehle diya kulasa ab kiya

 Initially i was very dilemma but got very much love when connected
 haa, kuch ghatnaayen ho jaati hai kuch log aapako bhadakaane kii koshish karte hai wo bhi bachche kaa naam rakhane jaisi baat par

 There is a way to talk to people on social media, i am so lucky that i got so much love
 tippaniyan Significantly, two months ago there was a debate on social media about the name of Taimur, the newborn son of Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor
 irfan pathan bhi bete ke pita bane
 Reminiscent of this controversy, a fan had advised Irfan not to name his son Dawood or Yakub
 lekin bina maange mili is salaah par irfan pathan ne deshbhakti kii bhaavana se bharaa aisa jawaab diya ki har koi vaah-vaah kar uthaa tha
 Irfan Pathan wrote to his fan on Twitter, 'whatever the name will be, but one thing is sure, he will also illuminate the name of this country (father) like father and elder father
 2004 main pakistan daure par lahore ke ek college main ek chaatra ke sawaal kaa bhi unhone zikr kiya jisane pathan se poocha tha aap muslmaan hokar bharat ke liye kyon khelte hai jawaab main maine kaha main bharat main paidaa hua hum, bhartiya hum, bhartiya hone par mujhe garv he
 It is a matter of prestige and luck for me to play for my country

 i am proud of whatever small work i can do for the country
 " Recently, on Twitter's response to his son's name Imran, Irfan also replied, "social media is a very complex platform, a medium where you can connect directly with your fans
" shuruyaat main main bahut duvidha main tha lekin jab judaa to bahut pyaar mila
 Yes, some incidents happen, some people try to provoke you on the matter of naming the child
 darasal mere bade bhai kaa naam imran tha jiske saadhe teen saal main hi intkaal ho gaya
 My mother used to get emotional by calling me Imran many times when i had decided that i would name my son Imran
 soshal media par logon se baat karne kaa ek tarika hota he, main bahut khushkismat hum ki mujhe itnaa pyaar mila
 The comments gauratlab he ki do maah pehle bollywood actor saf ali khan or karina kapur ke navjaat bete kaa naam taimur rakhe jane ko lekar soshal media par bahes chhidi gai thi
 Irfan Pathan also became the son's father
 aparoksh rup se is vivaad kii yaad taaja karte hue ek fain ne irfan ko bete kaa naam daaud yaa yaqub nahin rakhane kii salaah de daali thi
 But Irfan Pathan gave such a patriotic reply, on the advice that he got it without asking, that everyone woke up
 irfan pathan ne apane is prashansak ko jawaab main twitor par likhaa, 'naam chaahe kuch bhi rakhenge, lekin ek baat pakki he wo bhi papa or bade papa kii tarah is mulk (desh) kaa naam roshan karegaa
 He also referred to the question of a student in a college in Lahore on a tour of Pakistan in 2004, who asked Pathan why do you play for India as a Muslim? Answer i said i was born in India, i am an Indian, being an Indian i am proud
 apane desh ke liye khelnaa mere liye pratishtha or kismat kii baat he
 Millions of cricketers play cricket, but i have got the opportunity to represent the country

 It has 13 chapters and 178 pages
 inamen sirf ek chapter sikh itihaas kaa rakhaa gaya he

 ) supreme court ne gujarat sarkaar ko yah aadesh diya he ki vah tode gaye dharmik sthalon kaa byoraa court main pesh kare
 The order came as part of the ongoing lawsuit over the 2002 riots
 isse pehle hai court ne gujarat sarkaar ko aadesh diya tha ki dange ke dauraan kshatigrast hue yaa tode gaye dharmik sthalon ko sarkaar muaavja de
 The Gujarat government appealed to the Supreme Court against this order of the High Court, during the hearing of which the court has ordered the Gujarat government to present the details of the religious places damaged or broken during the riots
 isse pehle narendra modi sarkaar ko karaara jhatka dete hue gujarat hai court ne godhra cond ke baad saal 2002 main hue dangon ke dauraan 500 se adhik dharmik dhaanchon ko kshatigrast kiye jane ke liye muaavje dene kaa aadesh diya tha
 The court said in its order that the state cannot escape its responsibility
 sarkaar kii taraf se bhi ‘laaparvaahee’ hui he kyonki (is tarah kii niskriyata or laaparvaahee se) vyapak paimaane par dharmik sampattiyon ko nuksaan pahunchaaya gaya he
 According to the court, the government is responsible for the repair and compensation of such sites
 jab sarkaar ne makaanon or vanijyik pratishthanon ko tabah kiye jane ke liye muaavja diya tha to use dharmik dhaanchon ke liye bhi muaavje kaa bhugtan karnaa chahie
 The court had also ordered that the Chief Justice of 26 districts of the state will receive and decide on the application for compensation in respect of religious structures in their respective districts
 unase chah maheene ke bheetar adaalat ko apana faisla bhejne ko kaha gaya tha
 The order was given after hearing a petition filed by the court Islamic Relief Committee of Gujarat (IRCG)
 godhra cond ke baad hue dangon main 1200 se adhik log maare gaye the or rajya ke kai hisson main tabaahi hui thi
 In 2003, the IRCG petition sought the court to direct the government to pay compensation for damage to religious places during the riots
 yah nirdesh is aadhaar par dene kii maang kii gai thi ki rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ne bhi anushansa kii thi or rajya sarkaar ne siddhant rup main suzav sweekaar kar liya tha
 The state government had opposed the petition saying that it is a violation of fundamental rights under Article 27 of the Constitution, which prevents the government from levying any tax to promote a religion
 sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha ki dangon ke dauraan kshatigrast hue dharmik sthalon ko behaal karne yaa marammat karne ke liye muaavje kii koi niti nahin he
 And on this basis, the Government of Gujarat appealed against this decision in the Supreme Court
