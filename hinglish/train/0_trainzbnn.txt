 It is written on an information bar inside the bank that on Saturday, the locker room opens from 10 am to 1 pm
 jabaki baaki din subah das baje se shaam chaar baje tak
 Sunday is obviously a bank holiday
 yani bank ke loker par haath saaf karne ke liye luteron ke paas shanivaar shaam se lekar somvaar subah tak kaa vakt tha
 And they took advantage of this time
 har bank kii tarah is bank main bhi loker lene ke liye bank main khaataa khulwaanaa yaa 10 hajaar rupee kii epady karaani jaruri thi
 After Saturday's half-day and Sunday's holiday, everything was fine when the bank opened on Monday
 magar bank kaa manager jaise hi store room pahunchaa jahaan ki loker or bank kaa strang room tha uski havaaiyaan ud gayi
 Half of the lockers were open inside
 farsh par saamaan bikharaa tha
 And right along the wall of the locker was a big pit on the floor below
 ye kuch or nahin balki vahi surang tha jisase lutere bank ke andar daakhil hue the
 Bank manager Devendra Malik informed the police
 police kii team kisi tarah surang ke andar daakhil hui
 The pitch inside the tunnel was dark
 iske baad kareeb sau feet kii duuri ke baad police team ko surang kaa doosraa sira mila
 The mouth of the tunnel was nowhere else but the house on the left side of the bank was closed by crossing this street
 ye makaan pichley kaaphi vakt se khaali he
 The landlord lives outside Sonipat
 surang khodne ke liye lutere makaan ke andar is khidki ke raste daakhil hue the
 From the house through which the tunnel was dug, it takes a total of 57 seconds to decide the distance from the locker room of Punjab National Bank
 lekin is faasale ko surang ke jariye puri karne main luteron ko kareeb maheene bhar kaa vakt laga
 Obviously, preparation and planning will also take time
 isiilie baar-baar ye shaq or sawaal uthta he ki is sabase badi bank robery ke peeche bank kaa hi koi apana to shaamil nahin he?vaise bank staff ke mutabik jis jagah loker room he vahiin baraabar main bank kaa strang room he jisamen bank kaa cash rakhaa hota he
 At the time of the robbery, there were millions of cash in the Strong Room
 magar lutere strong room ko shaayad nahin tod paae isiilie bank kaa sara cash batch gaya
 Obviously, if the planning of the robbers was accurate, then the bank's negligence was also no less
 arabiai yani bhartiya rigerv bank ke niyamon ke mutabik loker main rakhe gaye saamaan ke khone yaa chori ho jane ke maamle main bank koi harjaana nahin detaa
 The reasoning behind this is that the bank does not know who has kept what in the bank locker? On what basis should the damages be awarded? But the question is that when the bank knows that there are such rules regarding damages, then why did it not follow RBI rules for security? The bank's customers protested against the bank's negligence as to why the locker room should have been protected
 inaki maang he ki bank kii laaparvaahee kii vajah se inaki jindagi bhar kii puunji lut gai, isliye inhen uskaa muaavja diya jaae
 a special team of police is currently investigating the case
 is silsile main bank ke staff, loker ke maalik or duusare sabhi logon kii bhoomika ko khangala ja rahaa he
 Police believe that those involved in Haryana's largest bank, Robri, have some connection with this bank

 Due to this, thousands of employees will be sent on leave and many services will be stopped
 is baat ke koi sanket nahin hai ki yah shatdown kab tak chalegaa
 Earlier, a 1996 crisis of shutdown caused a tussle between Democrat President Bill Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress over a budget that lasted for 21 days
 mangalvaar se shuru hue is shatdown se america ke kareeb aath lakh karmchaaree prabhavit honge, or is anischitata ke bich rashtriya udyanon, smarakon or sangrahalayon ke saath hi adhikansh sangheey karyaalay band kar die jaaenge

 Along with this, the hearing in Congress will also be postponed in several cases, including the case of firing in the US Navy Yard last month
 yah sankat isliye paidaa hua, kyonki seenet ne somvaar ko bajet vidheyak main pratinidhisabha ke sanshodhano ko, or obamakare ko vittiya sahyog waapas liye jane ko do baar khaarij kar diya or ise waapas pratinidhisabha ko bhej diya
 But after an hour the federal government's acquittal began, Republicans in the House of Representatives reiterated their amendments to Obama Care, and asked the Senate to call a conference committee to iron out the differences
 tippaniyan Harry Reid, the leader of the majority in the Senate, dismissed it as 'messing up', and said, "there will be no bargaining with a gun to our heads
" " According to a CNN / ORC poll, 68 percent of Americans said the idea of shutting down the government even for a few days was bad, while 27 percent said it was good

 film kaa naam: a jentalmandiarector: raaj dicaster cast: siddharth malhotra, jacleen furnandis, sunil shetty, darshan kumaunvadhi: 2 ghanta 12 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 2 starraj or dike diarector kii jodi ne go goa gon film banaayi thi, uske baad ab siddharth malhotra ke dabl role avatar ko lekar ek baar phir se ye jodi aapke saamne urban kahani lekar ai he
 However, Siddharth Malhotra's previous film Baar Baar Dekho with Katrina Kaif disappointed the audience at the box office
 kya yah film darshakon kii aashaaon par khari utar paane main sakasham hogi? aaiye jaane, film rivyuu main
 
 
 siddharth-jacqueline will be seen doing 'lip lock' in a Gentleman, this song is viral
 This is the story of Gaurav (siddharth Malhotra) who works in a multinational company in the US and has a very beautiful nature
 usne america main ghar bhi le rakhaa he or bas ab use talash he ek wif kii
 Gaurav's friend Kavya (jacqueline Fernandes) who lives with him but does not want to have a relationship with him according to his calm nature
 kahani main twist tab aata he jab rishi (siddharth malhotra) kii entry hoti he jo ek karnal (sunil shetty) ke liye kaam karata he or alag-alag mishan par jaakar use anjaam detaa he
 When Gaurav and Rishi are confronted, such things are revealed that make the film thrill
 kavya ko rishi or gaurav main se koun pasand aata he, ye jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Siddharthkamazor will be seen romancing Jacqueline in a Gentleman - a very hilly Dulli story that gets weaker as it progresses, it was very important to work on the script
 - ek jamaana tha jab mahesh bhatta kaha karte the ki wo filmon main sex bechate hai or wo chal bhi jaaya karti thi, lekin is film main aapako kuch intimet seen dekhne ko milte hai par abhi jamaana badal gaya he
 If the audience does not get the story, they do not like going to the theater
 kahani or clymex kii marammat kii jaani chahie thi
 Siddharth Malhotra took an auto ride to the gym - as well as a lot of such incidents which would have been edited and given a film and crisp
 kyon dekh sakate hai- siddharth malhotra kaa abhinay film dar film or behatar hota aa rahaa he jisko aap is film main bhi mahasoos kar sakate hai
 Jacqueline Fernandes is probably not paying attention to the role of playing her character and that is why her character is not able to come out separately
 - darshan kumaar or sunil shetty kaa kaam acha he
 Also, the action choreography in the film is tremendous and the way to shoot it is also excellent
 box offispramotion or production cost ko milakar film kaa bajet lagbhag 60 karod bataaya ja rahaa he or khabar he ki film lagbhag 2000 screens main relies kii jaayegi
 It will be very special to see how big weekend this film will get at the box office and that will determine its success

 punjab main chunaav prachaar thamane ke saath hi dilli mini punjab ke akhaade main tabdeel hone ja rahi he
 Now you must be wondering why Delhi was named as 'mini Punjab'
 darasal dilli gurudwara sikh prabandhak cameti ke chunaav 26 farvari ko hone hai, lekin is baar muqabla badal dal or sarna dal ke bich naa hokar punjab kii tarah trikoniya hone ke asaar he

 thik vaise hi jaise punjab chunaav main is baar sattadhari akali dal kaa sidhaa mukaabal aam aamadami party se he
 In the same way, the Delhi Gurdwara Sikh Management Committee election to be held before the MCD elections in Delhi is being seen as a semi-final
 dilli ke gurudwara chunaav main aam aadmi party samarthit panthak seva dal kii maujuudagi se chunaav rochak ho saktaa he
 However, if the Shiromani Akali Badal Dal holds the Gurdwara committee, it is difficult for the opposition parties to stand in front of the achievements of the committee
 shiromani akali dal (badal) ke adhyaksh manjit singh jike ke mutabik 84 dangon ke liye esaiti gathit karne main shiromani akali dal (badal) kii bhumika ahm he
 While on the committee of Badal Dal, special memorials have been made for 84 riots
 sikhon ke itihaas se lekar college main sikh chaatro ke liye aarakshan or skill deveopment trennig kii tarah garib bacchon ke liye kiye kaamon kii vajah se badal dal ko phir se chunaav jeetne kaa bharosa he
 At the same time, the Badal Pol Khol campaign will be launched to defeat the Badal Dal, who are in the opposition Sarna Dal Committee
 shiromani akali dal (sarna) ke adhyaksh paramjeet singh sarna ke mutabik badal dal ne sikhon ke liye koi kaam nahin kiya
 Even made Punjabi teachers unemployed
 skulon kaa str itnaa nimna ho gaya he sikh samudaay ab badalon ko vot nahin denge
 Let me tell you that the Sikh community will vote for the committee's 46 seats, in the last election the Shiromani Akali Dal (badal) won 37 seats, while the Sarna Dal got only 8 seats
 ek seat nirdaleey ke khate main gai
 It has to be seen who gets to occupy the Gurdwara Committee this time, because in the eyes of Delhiites, these elections will not be less than Mini Punjab

 The demand for special state status for Andhra Pradesh is stalled between the TDP and the NDA government at the Center
 is bich bihar kii taraf se bhi ek baar phir aisi maang uthi he
 Minister in Bihar government Maheshwar Hazari has said that Bihar also needs to get special status, this demand has been rising for a long time
 maheshwar hajaari ne kaha ki is mudde ko lekar bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar pradhanmantri narendra modi se mulaakaat kar sakate hai
 Nitish can repeat this demand in front of the PM
 tejasvi ne likhaa tha nitish ko khadbhi haal hi main bihar ke purv upmukhyamantri or argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ne bhi is maang ko lekar bihar ke mukhyamantri ko khat likhaa tha
 Bihar has been repeating this demand before
 tejasvi yadav ne nitish kumaar ko likhe khat main kaha tha ki vartmaan bihar sarkaar logon ko yah kahkar bhramit kar rahi he ki centre or rajya main ek hi gathbandhan kii sarkaar hone se vikaas ko gati milegi magar aisa kuch bhi nahin ho rahaa he
 In a letter to the Chief Minister, Tejashwi had said that according to the present state government, there is a double engine government in the state, but after the formation of this new government, only crime incidents have got double engine
 tejasvi ne kaha ki centre or rajya sarkaar kinhin agyaat vajahon se kisi prakaar kaa koi talmail nahin bana paa rahi he
 Significantly, in the TDP-BJP government of Andhra Pradesh, there has been a dispute over this issue
 rajya main bijepi cote ke do mantriyon ne apane pad se istipha de diya he, to vahiin centre main tidipi cote ke mantri istipha de sakate hai
 Under special state status, the state government is funded by the Center and some other facilities are also provided
 vishesh darja milane ke baad kisi yojana main centre se milane vaali raashi bad jaati he
 This ratio is 90:10, of which 90 per cent is given by the central government

 Rahul, who was on a two-day visit to Maharashtra, was in a conversation with tribal youths at an engineering college here on Wednesday
 unhen pradhanmantri banane kii shubhakamana dene vaale ek yuvak kii baat kaa jawaab dete hue rahul gandhi ne kaha, 'meraa pradhanmantri bananaa yaa nahin bananaa koi myne nahin rakhata
 The most important is that whoever is here in the country, especially women and youth, feel that it is their own country
 'yuvakon kaa raajnneeti kii mukhya dhara main aane kaa aahvaan karte hue congress netaa ne kaha ki ek bhi yuvak aisa nahin hona chahie jo kahata ho ki vah apane desh main daraa hua he
 Rahul Gandhi said, 'I want to see mlas, councilors and mps and even the Prime Minister from among you in the next ten years
 'mahatma gandhi or hitler kii tulana karte hue rahul gandhi ne kaha ki german taanashaah chillaata tha kyonki usamen vishwaas kaa abhaav tha
 But did Gandhiji ever shout? Because they believed in him
 mahatma gandhi kii tarah, bolte samay vinamrata behad aatmavishvaas kaa pratik he
 Faith should not be seen as resentment
 unhone kaha, 'kisi bhi baat ko aakraamak rup se kehane kii jarurat nahin he
 You can also say it with love
 bahut log aapke saath honge
 Rahul Gandhi said, 'if anyone, whether it is Rahul Gandhi or Prithviraj Chavan, says that he knows more than you, then he is lying
 congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha, 'meri aapse apil he ki, visheshkar adivasee yuvakon se ki raajnneeti kii mukhyadhara main aaen
 My message to the youth of the country is that the talent and abilities of the youth here are nowhere else
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki desh ne aazaadee ke baad se jo tarakkee kii he, uske chalate aaj bharat main kai amir log hai
 50 to 70 years ago there was not a single rich person here
 keval maharaja or british log hi dhani the
 Rahul said, 'my thinking is of fearless Indians in India
 main aise hi bharat kaa nirmaan karnaa chahta hum
 He said, India is the most talented nation in the world
 is pratibha kaa istemaal karen or apane drushtikon main vinamrata laaen or ek duusare kaa sammaan karen
 Saying all this, India will demand the release of Kulbhushan in the International Court of Justice
 iske baad pakistan bhi 13 disambar ko apana memorial daakhil karegaa
 On 16 June, the court had given 13 days to India and 13 December to Pakistan for filing this memorial
 isse pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi se lekar videshmantri sushamaa swaraj tak kah chuki he ki puure desh kii bhavanaaen kulbhushan jadhav ke saath judi he or usko rihaai ke liye bharat har sambhav koshish karegaa

 unhone kaha ki kaashi main yojit hone vaali dharmasansad mahaj ram mandir par kendrit nahin hogi isamen ganga kii durdasha samet sanathan dharm se jude sabhi muddon par charchaa hogi or jis mudde ko sabase zyada variyata di jaaegi usko praathamikta ke aadhaar par sabase upar rakhte hue dharmadesh paarit hoga

 Asking four questions, the Aam Aadmi Party has blamed the bjp-ruled MCD for the litter and pollution spreading in the city
 'aap' ne haal hi main kanoon ke chaatr ke dwaara daakhil kii gai ek yachika kii sunwaayee par us tippanee kaa zikr kiya, jahaan emsidi ko desh kii rajdhani main faile kooday ke maamle main yah fatkaar lagaai he
 During the press conference on Saturday, Aam Aadmi Party leader Dilip Pandey said that the bjp-ruled MCD was so badly beaten by the Delhi High Court that the BJP had proved to be a failure in the administration of the MCD
 hai court ne kaha ki kya bhartiya janata party ke netaa isi shahar main rahete hai yaa kisi or grah par rahete hai? kya unako sadakon par padi gandagi or kooda najar nahin aata? iske alaava court ne yahaan tak bhi kah diya ki emsidi nikammepan kii vajah se ek din aisa aane vaala he ki dilli kii janata pakadakar ham sabkon peetane vaali he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has asked the MCD and BJP leaders these 4 questions - 1- Why do bjp-ruled MCD want to keep Delhi polluted and dirty despite being repeatedly harassed by constitutional bodies like High Court, Supreme Court and CAG? Why bjp-ruled MCD does not fulfill its constitutional responsibility of cleanliness? 2- BJP leaders sitting in MCD have little or no guilt or shame left after being scolded? 3- Delhi Whether there is any short-term or long-term plan for disposal of garbage in BJP leaders sitting in the MCD? 4- Delhi being the capital of the country is also a mirror of the country, why the seed Is the GP smearing the country's face and mirror through the city's MCD? kanpur ke jyoti hatyakand main police ne uske pati piyush or uski do garlphend ko teen maheene main bhaje gaye 700 pej ke esemes hasil kar liye hai

 Another new controversy has come up in the disability pension case in the military forces
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman kaa ek internal note soshal netwarking site tivetor par saamne aayaa he jisamen sainya balon kii pension par tex lagane ko sahi tehraaya gaya he
 The Finance Minister made a tweet on Tuesday in response to those opposing the government's decision to impose a tax on disability pensions, calling the internal note "the military's response to the issue of tax on disability pensions"
 iske jawaab main army ne apane tivetor handle se ek twit kiya or likhaa, 'bhartiya sena apane un sabhi staff ko lekar phikrmand he jo naukari ke dauraan yuddh yaa anya kaarnon se baahar ho gaye hai
 We want additional help for such people and discourage those who get financial benefits because of their disability

 army ne apane twit main likhaa he ki yah chalan kaaphi chintajanak he kyonki desh ke saamne suraksha kii chunautiyaan pehle kii tulana main kaaphi badi hai
 The government is now preparing to impose an income tax on the pension received by disabled soldiers
 haalanki ve sainik jo apni viklaangata ke kaaran sena main sevaayen nahin de paa rahe hai or viklaangata ke chalate naukari chhodani pad rahi he unhen is iskar chhot kaa laabh miltaa rahegaa

 The circular states that a detailed investigation has been done on this issue and in the original notification issued on March 21, 1922, it is clear that only those who have suffered disability due to their service will be able to take exemption in tax
 isi ko aadhaar banaate hue pension par tex lagane kaa faisla kiya gaya
 Some serving officers believe that some senior army officers misuse the disability pension but that does not mean it should be removed
 ek adhikari ne kaha, 'bhrashtachariyon ko pakadaney ke liye hamaare paas kargar system hona chahie
 We should have a strict system of work so that schemes are not exploited
 ' sena ke kai ritred adhikari tivetor par sarkaar ke is faisle kii aalochana kar rahe hai

 During their ascent, these women are also facing the displeasure of devotees
 ravivaar ko in donon mahilaon ke virodh main kai shraddhaalu (sabarimala Temple) ne unka rasta rokane kii koshish lekin police ne unhen hataa diya
 Let me tell you that a day ago a group of 11 women tried to reach Lord Ayyappa temple, but they had to face the protest of hundreds of devotees during that time also

 The women were able to move only 100 meters on the traditional path leading to the temple

 Hundreds of devotees gathered here in defiance of the prohibitory order and started singing loud hymns to Lord Ayyappa
 police ne pradarshnakariyon ko balpurvak vahaan se hataane kii koshish kii kyonki baar-baar ghoshnaaen kiye jane kii baad bhi ve vahaan se jane ko taiyaar nahin the

 The question is whether it is possible to bring him home under the extradition laws of India, bilateral agreements with other countries so that legal action can be taken against them
 jawaab hoga, haa, bhartiya pratyrpan kanoon evam aapasi kanoonee sahaayta sandhi ke jariye unhen waapas laayaa ja saktaa he
 But there are many difficulties as well
 aaie samajhate hai kanoon kii jatiltaaon ko paanch binduon main-1-kya he pratyrpan sandhividesh mantralay kii website ke mutabik, pratyrpan sandhi ke tahat koi bhi desh kisi aaropee ko duusare desh ko saunpta he
 This is possible only when the accused is proved guilty and the court convicts him
 ek bhagauda apradhi ke maamle main hi kisi desh ke saath pratyrpan ke liye prakriya shuru karne kaa aupchaarik aavedan kiya ja saktaa he
 In this, it has to be kept in mind that the offense of the offender should be covered under the extradition treaty with the said country
 2-kya he jatiltamgar isse pehle hamen pratyrpan sandhi kii jatilta ko samajhnaa hoga
 The provisions of the first-extradition law apply only in situations where the crime of the accused is considered a crime in both countries
 doosraa- aarthik dhokhadhadi ke maamle main aaropee ko videsh se bharat laayaa ja saktaa he, lekin uske liye bharat ko adalati prakriya se guzarana hoga
 But it is not as easy as it is understood
 kyonki duusare deshon ke saath hui bharat kii pratyrpan sandhi main dashakon se koi badlaav yaa sanshodhan nahin kiya gaya he
 Extradition in the old case, the cases of bringing the culprits of economic fraud to the country can be considered as examples
 international frod narendra kumaar rastogi ko july 2008 main pratyrpan sandhi ke jariye hi bharat laayaa gaya tha
 He was not alone among the fraudsters, but also his brothers Ravinder, Virender, Subhash Chand and cousin Rakesh
 in sab bhaaiyon ne milakar 1989-92 ke dauraan bharat sarkaar ko 54 karod rupee kaa chuunaa lagaaya tha
 The Rastogi brothers fled Dubai, America, Britain and Singapore with the government money
 is maamle main ravinder ko 2003 main bharat laayaa gaya or abhi vah jamaanat par baahar he
 Narendra was extradited in 2008
 narendra dhokhadhadi ke ek anya maamle main america kii jail main bhi 84 maheene gujaarey
 He was then brought to India
 vahiin rakesh abhi tak gaayab he
 4-how will Nirav Modi Nirav Modi have to go through the legal process to bring India
 sabase pehle inke khilaaf adaalat main sunwaayee hogi or doshi qaraar diya janaa chahie
 After being convicted, the investigating agencies have to find out which country Nirav Modi is in and also see what kind of extradition treaty he has with that country
 in sab chizon ke baad us desh ke saath neerav modi ke pratyrpan kii aupchaarik prakriya shuru kerani hogi
 5-two accused, one law India has extradition treaty with 43 countries so far
 abhi abhi bharat kaa iran ke saath is tarah kii sandhi hui he
 India also has extradition treaties with Britain and the United States
 dhokhadhadi kaa ek aaropee vijay maalya britain main rah rahaa he jise bharat laane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Though there is a slight difference in the charge against Mallya and Nirav Modi, both will have to be extradited to India under the same law
 sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki agar neerav us desh main he jisase pratyrpan sandhi he to use bharat laayaa ja saktaa he, lekin phir bhi yah itnaa aasaan nahin he
 PM Lal from Red Fort said that no one is small, no one is big

 upi main bijli ko lekar siyaasi mahabharat shuru ho gai he
 Today, in the whole of Uttar Pradesh, BJP took the road against the poor electricity system and demonstrated
 bijepi kaa aarope he ki uttar pradesh main bijli ko lekar haahaakaar machaa hua he
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the power system was in good shape and people were getting electricity, but after the crushing defeat in the election, it seems that the Samajwadi Party is taking revenge for the defeat of the people of the state
 lakhanu se lekar varanasi ho yaa phir amethi raibareli ho bijli na aane se log behaal hai
 Before the election, electricity was given for 20 to 24 hours, but after the crushing defeat in the election, people have come to power
 haalanki aisa nahin he ki ye haal puure pradesh kaa he
 Power is still being given equally in the district where the SP has won in the Lok Sabha elections
 upi bijepi ne bijli katautee ke khilaaf aaj lakhanu main upi power corporation ke daftar kaa hi gheraav kar diya
 Apart from this, protests were also held in every district from Kanpur, Varanasi, Jhansi
 bijepi kaa aarope he ki chunaav ke baad se samaajawaadee party ne badale kii niyat se jaanboojhkar bijli supplai gata di he jisase haahaakaar machaa hua he
 While SP districts continue to supply
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant vaajapeyi kaa kahana he ki 7may ke baad jis tarah bijli aapurti ko ghataya gaya he, uske virodh main sapa sarkaar ke khilaaf hamaara pradarshan he
 Vajpayee said that the UP government came into the fray on the basis of government data
 varanasi main narendra modi chunaav kya jite, maano yahaan ke logon ke liye bijli ko lekar to behad bure din aa gaye hai
 Since the election results, there has been a huge power cut
 sarkari roster ke mutabik bijli kii katautee sirf 4 ghante kii he, jabaki halaat ye he kii 10 se 12 ghante har din bijli kaa gul rahanaa aam baat he
 Officials say that these cuts are due to local fault
 haalat ye he ki bheeshan garmi main jhulas rahe logon ke upar bijli kii ye maar ye sochane ko majaboor kar rahi he ki ye kahin modi ko vot dene kii sajaa to nahin mil rahi he
 Forced cuts in Modi's Varanasi: Najma, a resident of Banaras, says that since the Modi government won from here, the condition of light has worsened
 emel sharma, nideshak takneekee bijli vibhaag, varanasi kaa kahana he ki 16 tarikh se hamaara shedul chaar ghante katautee kaa he
 Sometimes we have to cut more if there is a problem in our grid
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kaa kahana he ki bijepi raajnneeti se prerit hokar aarope laga rahi he
 There is a power crisis in summer
 ise durust karne ke liye kaam kiya ja rahaa he or 2016 tak gaanvon me 18 ghante or shaharon me 22 se 24 ghante bijli milane lagegi
 These are due to the crisis, in the time of the Mayawati government, in December 2010, the responsibility of a new power project of ten thousand six hundred and forty MW was given to some private houses
 isamen yah shart thi ki yadi 18 maheene baad bhi agar kaam na shuru ho sake to qaraar radd ho janaa tha
 His bail of 500 crores was also to be canceled
 lekin 18 maheene puraa hone ke baad akhilesh sarkaar ne phir unako 18 maheene kaa samay de diya
 In December 2013, he completed 18 months and then was given 18 months
 pichley do saal main upi sarkaar ne ek megawatt bijli kaa utpaadan nahin badhaayaa he
 Due to all these things, the crisis in UP continues

 After the announcement of support by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to NDA Presidential candidate and till recently the Governor of Bihar, Ramnath Kovind has started speculating on the strength of Bihar's Grand Alliance government in political corridors from Bihar to Delhi
 ab sawaal ye he ki nitish kumaar ke raashtrapati chunaav main endie ummidavaar ko samarthan ke elaan ke baad lalu prasad yadav ke saath ab unki raah alag hone kaa samay jaldi hi aane vaala he kya
 This decision can also be seen in the heat of recent times in the relationship between Nitish Kumar and PM Narendra Modi
 kuch vakt pehle ek-duusare se nazren churaane vaale donon netaaon ke bich badhati dosti ke kaaran hi nitish kumaar sonia gandhi ke bhoj main nahin gaye or sonia ke bhoj ke ek din baad hi piem modi ke nimantran par unke saath morishas ke piem ke saath lunch main shaamil hue
 This is the reason that the cleanliness given by Nitish Kumar on this support is not embracing the people of political circles
 guuruuvaar ko lalu yadav ne jis tarah nitish kumaar par bayaan diya he uske baad bihar kii sarkaar kii umr zyada nahin lagati he
 Because Nitish Kumar is upset about this for the last few days
 lalu parivaarake har din naye karname se unki chhavi par aanch aa rahi he
 Perhaps this is why Nitish Kumar's friendship with PM Modi is increasing everyday
 kehete hai ki raajnneeti main koi bhi sthaayee dushman yaa dost nahin hota isliye kahinrashtrapati chunaavake turant baad hi bihar main ek baar phir senithish kumaar ke netritv main endie kii sarkarbane to aashcharyachakit nahin hona chahie

 It will be kept in mind that these countries will continue to be a source of economic growth and innovation and prosperity for their crores of people and the remaining markets of the world
 ’’tata ne kaha he ki petroleum padaarthon ke oonche daam ke saath saath oonchi byaaj dar or karj ke kade praavdhaanon se bharat or china main automobile sahit anya upabhokta vastuon kii maang main tej giravat aayegi

 Tata has said that as a result of these measures, the pace of economic growth is slowing down and demand for various commodities including automobiles will be affected

 For the first time in China in the last two years, automobile sales have come down
 ’’ Earlier, booking a train ticket to go there was considered to be one of the most dangerous things in the country till a few years ago

 Today it sells 6 lakh tickets daily which is more than 55% of the total ticket sales
 pichley saal isse hui bikri 22,023 karod ru

 yahi kaaran he ki haal main rail mantri suresh prabhu ne kaha tha ki iarsitisi ke paas amejan jitna bada hone kii kshamta he
 Big Plans irctc's server has been upgraded so that it can handle 15,000 users at a time

 himachal pradesh ke bilaspur main bani is kabr se lambii kabr kahin nahin hogi, vaise bhi insaan jab kabr khodta he tabhi gaharaai naapta he, par yahaan ye kabr to khudahi ban gai
 And that too within 30 meters of a tunnel being built in the mountain
 philhal is kabr main pichley 8 dinon se 3 zindaa insaan dafan hai
 Yes, for the last 8 days, there is a struggle to get these three people out of this tomb safely
 in teenon kaa baahar kii duniya se sampark kaa koijariya he to bas malbe kii diwaar main ek chhed ke raste paar kiya gaya camera
 Who can bring the condition of these people to the outside world and their loved ones
 surang ke 30 meter andar kabr mezinda dafanaye majaboor insaan is camere ke jariye apana haal apane gharavaalon ko bataa sakate hai
 At present, these three men are trapped in a cave from all four sides, around which there are mountains
 alam ye he ki ye naa to is gupha se baharnical saktehain or naa hi koi inkaa haal jaanane ke liye is gupha ke andar ja saktaa he
 We can hardly guess how difficult it is for these workers trapped in the tunnel to spend a moment
 baahar inke parivaar vaale inke baahar jinda aane kii dua kar rahe hai to andar inke bhi jehan main apane parivaar se milane kii chahat he
 Currently, the only way to encourage the workers trapped in this tunnel is the microphone and the CCTV camera with the help of which they can tell their heart condition to the officials sitting outside
 is andheri surang main kaid in logon par ek-ek pal bitaana or sahi-salaamat baahar nikalne kaa intjaar kitna baari guzar rahaa hoga ham or aap to sirf iskaa ahsaas hi kar sakate hai
 a dark tunnel, no wind and no water, and 3 laborers trapped in it
 ye manjar soch kar hirongte khadeyho jaaen, lekin sach yahi he ki himachal pradesh ke bilaspur main kiratpur-nerchowk haive par ban rahi ek surang main teen majdoor pichley 8 din se fanse hai
 Although the NDRF team is trying its best to rescue them, the biggest question is whether these people will be able to come out of this tomb alive? It is noteworthy that near the Panoh on kiratpur-nerchauk Fourlane Highway in Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh The work of constructing a tunnel of one and a half kilometers was going on
 12 sitambar 2015 kii raat kareeb saadhe aath baje isi nirmaanadhin tunnel main kaam kar rahe mazaduron kii shift badal rahi thi, us vakt tunnel ke andar 16 majdoor kaam kar rahe the
 Only 13 of these 16 people were able to come out when suddenly an accident took place inside the tunnel and debris fell from the 25 feet high roof of the tunnel and all three workers, Satish Kumar, Mani Ram and Hindi Ram got trapped inside the tunnel went
 aapako bataa den kihimachal pradesh ke bilaspuraki tihara surang main fanse mazdooron ko 8 din or 190 ghante biit jane ke baad bhi baahar nahin nikaala ja sakaa he
 Satish and Maniram, trapped in the tunnel, spent 4 days in the dark, eating and drinking without eating
 paanchaven din unase sampark kiya ja sakaa
 According to officials, hard rocks are hindering the evacuation of the workers trapped in the dark tunnel
 itnaa hi nahin jab bhi wo surang main malbe ko hataane kii koshish karte hai to upar se or malba gir jaataa he
 However, NDRF teams from Bathinda and Una are present on the spot to evacuate the workers
 sutron ke mutabik mazdooron ko surang se baahar nikaalane ke liye rajasthan se aadhunik drilling mashin mangai gai he
 With the help of which a 30 meter hole has been made across the debris
 adhikariyon ke mutabik shuukravaar ko tunnel main fanse mazdooron ko ek pipe kii madad se din main teen baar khaanaa bheja gaya
 Apart from this, to increase the confidence of the trapped laborers in the tunnel, contact has been made with the workers through CCTV and microphone
 sutron ke mutabik mazaduron ne is tunnel khee chat main ek bade crack yani chhed hone ke bare main adhikariyon se shikaayat kii thi or unka aarope he ki adhikariyon ne unki is shikaayat ko sanjidagi se nahin liya
 And shortly after that this accident happened
 lekin abhi sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki aakhir andherikabr main rahakar maut ke khilaaf ye jangaye teenon aakhir kaise ladegi? kya7 dinon tak kabr menfanse rahane ke baavjood ye insaan jinda nikal paaenge? yaa phir yekbr in teenon logon ke liye sachmuchakbrahi sabitahogi?kuch saal pehle chile main bhi sone kii ek khadaan main thik aisa hi haadasa hua tha
 There 33 workers were stuck in a gold mine for 69 days
 lekin unhone himmat nahin haari or aakhirkaar 69 din kii jaddojahad ke baad unhen khadaan se sahi-salaamat baahar nikaal liya gaya
 It was really nothing short of charisma
 (capsule se baahar aane par khush hote khadaan majdoor, unke saathi or gharavaalon ke shot lagaaein) maut ke munh se waapas aane kii khushi kya hoti he kabr main 69 din bitaa kar jinda nikle in insaanon se puuchhiye
 And ask those of their loved ones who had completely lost hope of seeing them alive
 sachmuch ye kisi karishme se kam nahin tha
 Because it has not happened in the world till today, two and a half thousand feet below the surface of the ground
 bina hawa, pani or khaane ke do maheene se zyada kaid rahane ke baad 33 insaan jinda nikal aae hon
 But this group of 33 humans has proved with passion and passion to stay alive that if a person wishes, he can win the battle of life against death
 darasal 5 agast 2010 ko chile kii is sona khadaan main pathar girane ke baad taintis majdoor jameen ke neeche funs gayi the
 Since this part of the mine was covered with hard stones, it took three weeks for the people involved in relief and rescue work to contact them
 is dauraan ye khadaan majdoor hajaaron feet neeche bane ek tahkhaane main band rahe
 And just two days of food for thirty three laborers
 inhone teen hafton tak chalaaya
 Finally, after three weeks, when one end of the drilling machine came close to these workers, they wrote the message of their being alive on a paper and brought it back to the ground through the same drilling machine
 tab pehali baar iskhadaan ke andar ek chhed ke sahare mazdooron tak sisitivi camera or khaane kaa kuch saamaan pahunchaaya ja sakaa
 In this way, 69 days were passed and 33 humans buried in the tomb on 5 August started coming out alive through the tunnel dug through drilling machine on the night of 12 October
 chile ke logon ke liye
 Especially for the family members of the mine workers, this opportunity was no less than a celebration
 sone ke khan main sona nikaalane pahunche the 33 majdoor, par achaanak sone kii khan dhans gai or jis raste se wo andar utre the wo rasta puri tarah se band ho gaya
 Leave out, the outside light was not coming inside
 duniya samajhi ki saare majdoor maare gaye
 But after 17 days, suddenly a miracle happens
 khadaan ke andar ek bade bedroom jaisi jagah par 33 log 69 dinon tak maut se jang ladate rahe
 In a small place, so many people and in such a situation where it is difficult to tell exactly what will happen the next moment, and their exit from such a place is nothing short of a miracle
 vaise is chamatkaar kaa shrey agar khadaanakarmiyon ke jazbe ko diya gaya
 By the way, the efforts of the rescue team and the blessings of the family were equally shared
 khadaan ke baahar maujuud log chitthee bhej kar or phone ke jariye in logon kaa haunsala badhaane kii lagaataar koshish karte rahe
 Bibles were sent through the hole to enable people to pray in the mine
 khud chile sarkaar ke mantri is muhim main shaamil rahe
 The government had clearly told those trapped in the mine that they would not be left alone
 yahi vajah he ki jab kangaali kii vajah se khadaan company ne rescue oparation se haath khadey kar die the to sarkaar ne khud iskaa jimmaa sambhaal liya tha
 Yes, strong intent is necessary to fight such a difficult situation
 majboot haunsale kaa hona
 Because in this condition, losing hope meant death
 lekin, ye mishan aasaan bhi nahin tha
 But still the rescue team continued their efforts throughout the day and finally after 69 days all the 33 people were safely taken out of this mine
 rashtramandal khelon kii dhimi taiyaari ke liye aalochanaon se ghiri dilli sarkaar ne aaj kai ahm pariyojnaon main deree kii baat sweekaar kii or kaha ki shaayad kuch stadium kaa kaam 31 agast kii antim samay seemaa tak bhi puraa nahin ho
 After taking stock of the progress of work in Yamuna Sports Complex, Delhi Finance Minister AK Walia said that the government is not satisfied with the pace of work in some stadiums
 walia ne kaha, ‘‘ham (kuch stadimon main) kaam kii pragati se santusht nahin hai
 They (agencies engaged in construction work) are saying that all the work will be completed before the deadline
 lekin isamen andeh he
 He also admitted that some important projects being completed by the Delhi government are also being delayed
 walia ne kaha, ‘‘sambandhit agenciyon ko pratiyogita se judaa sabhi kaam 31 agast tak puraa karne ko kaha gaya he
 Much work still remains to be done
 hamen kai mushkilon kaa saamana bhi karnaa pad rahaa he
 We all have to work very hard

 navagrahon main brihaspati ko guru or mantranaa kaa kaarak mana jaataa he
 The yellow color governs gold, finance and kosha, law, religion, knowledge, mantras, Brahmanas and rites

 Due to the suzerain of the sky element in the five elements, its effect is very wide and vast
 mahilaon ke jivan main vivaah kii sampoorn jimmedaari brihaspati se hi tay hoti he
 How to understand that Jupiter is inauspicious in life? - Weakness of Jupiter weakens the person's rites- Along with hindrance in learning and wealth, the person has difficulties in getting support of elders- The digestive system of the person is weak, Only Jupiter gives all the serious problems of cancer and liver - problems on the side of the child also bothers - a person usually tends towards low karma and Su does not respect elders
 What are the signs of the auspicious of Brihaspati? - The person is learned and knowledgeable, gets great respect - the person has divine grace and the person is saved from all the problems in life - such people usually But religion, Do not consume salt on this day - plant a banana tree in the back of the house and add water to it in the morning - chant the mantras of Jupiter - reciting Vishnu Sahastranam in the morning is also very beneficial - respect the elders of the house And plant a fruitful tree - if Jupiter is inauspicious, then you should not wear garland and gold around your neck, if Jupiter is inauspicious and is giving deadly results then what measures should be taken? Mix turmeric in the morning and offer water to the sun - keep a square piece of gold or brass near you - wrap the banyan root in yellow thread and wear it around the neck - Must use turmeric in food - Gajendra Moksha recitation before daily sunrise If you are unfortunately not giving up on you haal hi main dilli se lekar neuyork tak antarrashtriya yoga diwas manaaya gaya he

 Most of the confusion is about Prepostion when writing or speaking in English
 Preposition kaa upyog karne ke liye koi tay niyam nahin he
 There are many such prepositions that look similar in appearance but they have different meanings

 Ferozeshah Kotla has always been lucky for India
 kumble kaa yah pasandida maidan he
 Dhoni's favorite Maidan Dhoni has won most of the victories here, not only captaining his national IPL teams, while Kohli made his golden debut from this ground
 bharat ne pichley 11 saal se yahaan koi match nahin ganvaaya or vartmaan paristhitiyon main jis tarah se vah test se lekar pehle vanade tak kiwi team par haaavee he usase dhoni and company ke liye kotla ek or shandaar jeet kaa gavaah ban saktaa he
 Encouraged by the victory, India had also registered a one-sided victory in the first ODI at Dharamsala after clearing the Kiwis 3–0 in the Team India Test series
 agle saal england main hone vaali champions trophy ko dhyaan main rakhkar is shrinkhalaa main utari bhartiya team ke hausale buland hai lekin khilaadiyon main ‘kabhi kisi ko kam nahin aankane’ kii nai soch se yah tay he ki ve is match main bhi kisi tarah kii kami chhodane kii koshish nahin karenge
 The pitch will be bouncy! Kotla's pitch has generally been considered slow and supportive of spinners, but this time it has been claimed that it will be fast and bouncy
 swaabhaavik he aise main agar tej gendbaajon ko kuch madad milegi to kohli, rohit sharma or ajinkya rahane jaise stroke player ise pasand bhi karenge
 If the pitch performed as per the claims, the spectators could see an exciting match

 Jasprit Bumrah specializes in performing well under any circumstances, while Amit Mishra, the leader of the spin department, has always liked Kotla
 spinneron par bada daaromadaryadi pich apane puraane mizaaj par laut aati he to phir akshar patel or kaamchalau spinner kedaar jadhav ko badi jimmedaari nibhaani padegi
 But of course everyone's eyes will be on Kohli, who has emerged as a 'virat Manav' on the world cricket table in the last few years
 dharmashala main unhone jabardast pari kheli or ab un par kotla main apane gharelu darshakon ke saamne badi pari khilne kii laalasaa balwati ho rahi hogi
 dhoni-kohli's Bjanega Dankakohli has played eight innings so far, including in Tests and odis at Kotla but he has only one century to his name which he scored against England in 2011 (112 not out)
 apni acchhee shuruuaat ko badi pari main badalane main maahir is star ballebaaj par madhyakram kii badi jimmedaari he lekin captain dhoni ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa he jo bada score banane ke liye lalayit hai
 Dhoni made it clear in Dharamshala that he would like to step down in his role as a finisher
 pehle match main vah 21 ran banaakar ran out ho gayi lekin yadi yahaan unako mauka miltaa he to phir dilli ke darshakon ko unka purana rup dekhne ko milegaa
 The loss of the spoiled Kiwi team to the team of New Zealand, then its players are under a lot of pressure after the Test and first ODI defeat
