 The Delhi government's gross negligence on the rising prices of onions has come to the fore
 nafed or kendriya krishi mantralam ne sarkaar ko april or may ke dauraan teen chitthiyaan likhakar kaha tha ki wo chaahe to saste dar par pyaaj kharidkar rakh sakate hai
 Price is also just Rs 19 a kg
 lekin dilli sarkaar ne pyaaj nahin kharidi
 Nafed director Ashok Thakurki believes that he did not respond to the letters written in April and June
 or aakhirkaar dilliwaalon ko majaboor hona padaa 60 rupye kilo pyaaj kharidne ke liye
 The Delhi government's statement on this entire matter is like sprinkling salt on the wounds of the people of Delhi
 dilli ke khaadya or vitaran vibhaag ke mantri aasim khan kaa kahana he ki nafed 19 rupye kilo pyaaj de to ham aaj lene ko taiyaar hai
 On the other hand, Nafed director nominee Ashok Thakur is speaking openly on Aaj Tak's camera that since April, a letter has been written to the Delhi government that there is a volatility in potato and onion prices in the monsoon
 lihaaja centre sarkaar kii piesuef yani price stabligeshan fund ke tahat nasik kii lasalgamv mandi main, jahaan nafed ne pyaaj kharid kar stock kii he, vahaan se dilli sarkaar kisaanon ko di ja rahi keemat par hi pyaaj kharid le
 According to the price of Rs 25 to Rs 19 to 20 per onion, if the onion was sold from Nashik to Delhi, then the transport, storage and distribution would have been Rs 5 to 6 and the Delhi onion would get at least 25 to maximum 30
 Rupees per kg
 lekin samay rahete dilli sarkaar ne naa to planning kii or naa hi nafed kii chitthiyon kaa jawaab diya
 The Delhi government has issued a press release in its clarification that Nafed should stop those who spread confusion over onion prices
 dilli sarkaar ne nafed se maang bhi kii he ki dilli ko nafed bataae ki wo kis keemat par pyaaj bechney ko taiyaar thi
 The Delhi government is referring to the letter of 24 July in its cleaning, but the letter of April 13 and June 18, which we have seen exclusively on Aaj Tak, has nothing to say
 vipaksh ne saadhaa nishanaavahin rajya bijepi samay rahete pyaaj naa stock karne ke liye sarkaar par nishaan saadh rahi he
 BJP leader Kuljit Chahal says that this is a great proof of Delhi government's arrogance
 jis centre sarkaar ke khilaaf wo postarwar chalaa rahi he aakhir usase hi pyaaj kaise kharide
 Obviously the Delhi government is concerned about its ego but not the pocket of the people of Delhi
 baharhaal, sawaal sirf samay rahete pyaaj kaa stock karne kaa nahin he balki ye bhi he ki aakhir kyon samay rahete kejariwal sarkaar ne nafed kii chitthiyon kaa jawaab nahin diya
 The question is also that if Delhi is compelled to buy onions for 60 rupees a kilogram, is it not responsible for the Delhi government? It is also a matter to note here that at present, the Delhi government is paying Rs
 40 per kg through sale shops
 Is going to provide cheap onions to the people
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki ye vahi pyaaj he jo nasik ke echefesi yani small formar agri bijness consortium se kharidi gayi he
 Last question, sir, when onion was to be purchased from Nashik, NAFED was also giving this suggestion to you from April
 aakhir samay rahete unki baat suni kyon nahin? The announcement of demonetisation is not taking the name of freezing chaos in the country
 piem modi ne beete 8 november ko 500 or 1000 rupee ke puraane note band karne or inaki jagah par 500 or 2000 ke nae note laane kaa elaan kiya
 After this announcement by the Prime Minister, the queues for cash in atms and banks are not being named
 sarkaar ne puraane note badalane kii dedline 30 disambar tay kii he
 After the trust of the PM, people are hoping that in 50 days the old notes will be replaced by new ones
 notebandi ke masale par sarkaar har duusare din nae elaan karti he
 To curb the corrupt, the government is making a rude step
 lekin puraane noton ke saamne aane or sarkari khajaane main jamaa hone tathaa inaki jagah nae note lene main kareeb 6 maheene lag sakate hai
 In the Indian economy of $ 2 trillion, about 98 percent of consumer payment is through cash
 aise main puraane noton ko badalane main deree hone se iconomi main nuksaan kii ashanka he
 It is estimated that due to this move of the government, between october-december, the country's growth rate is 0

 is tarah kii bayaan kaa istemaal mere muvakkil ke khilaaf kabhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Let us tell you that Asif had also lashed out at America during the Asia Society Seminar in New York and said that a few years ago Washington considered such people as 'darling'

 yahi vajah he ki aatankiyon ko panaah dene vaala or unhen jihad ke naam par uksaakar bharat bhejne vaala hafiz pakistan sarkaar ke khilaaf khadaa ho gaya he
 The notice sent to the Pakistan Foreign Minister states that Hafiz is a nationalist who loves Islam
 aise main videsh mantri kaa bayaan manahani vaala he or unhen pakistan ke pinal code ke section 500 ke tahat 5 saal kii jail or jurmaana bhugatna pad saktaa he
 According to the lawyer of Hafiz, this statement has hurt the honor of the terrorist Sargon and an attempt has been made to throw mud at him
 aise main hafiz ection kii maang karte hai
 In such a situation, this 14-day notice is being sent to the Foreign Minister
 aise main mere client hafiz unki izzat ko pakistan hi nahin duniyabar main nuksaan pahunchane ke liye 10 karod rupee jurmaane kii maang rakhi he
 Also, the foreign minister will have to bear the cost of all these cases

 There is also a reward of $ 10 million on Hafiz's arrest

 somvaar ko petrol-dijal kii badhati keemton ke virodh main vipaksh main baithe raajnneetik dalon ne band kaa aahvaan kiya
 Petrol prices continued to rise in the country during the bandh
 somvaar ko rajdhani dilli main petrol kii keemat 23 paison kii badhat ke saath pehali baar 80 rupee ke str ke paar raheen
 Petrol price in maharashtra 87
 77 rupee rahi
 Significantly, the price of petrol in Maharashtra is very close to the psychological level of Rs 90 per liter
 darasal desh main petrol kii keemat yadi 90 rupee ke str ko tod sakati hai
 The global market is witnessing a continuous rise in crude oil prices
 mahangaa kaccha tel kharidne se jahaan ek taraf kendra sarkaar ko apane khajaane se adhik rupaya kharch kar pad rahaa he vahiin desh main petrol ordijalki keemten lagaataar aasmaan chhu rahi hai
 Rupee still declines, 72 against the dollar
 18 ke str par khulaaaisi sthiti main gharelu bazaar main petrol or dijal kii keemton ko kaabo karne ke liye yadi kendra sarkaar or sabhi rajya sarkarein milakar apane tex main badi katautee karen to keemton ko kaabo kiya ja sakegaa
 But both central and state governments will lose a large part of their revenue from this step
 jahaan rajya sarkaron ko apnevatmen katautee karne se use rajyon main chalaai ja rahi lok kalyaan nitiyon ko chalaane main vittiya sankat kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 At the same time, the central government will be hit twice
 global market main crude oil kii lagaataar badhati keemton se adhik dollar kharch karnaa padataa he
 Know, how much the country will feel due to today's bandh, although the central government and state governments have ruled out the possibility that they will soon bring petrol and diesel under the ambit of GST
 lekin khaas baat he ki maujuuda sthiti main yadi petrol or dijal kii keemton ko jiesti ke daayre main dekha jaae to ek jatke main mumbai main 87
 Petrol sold at Rs 77 per liter will be cheaper by about 12 to 15 percent
 vahiin dilli main petrol kii keemat ko jiesti ke 28 or 18 fisadi ke tex daayre jo dekhen to lagbhag 9 fisadi kam kiya ja saktaa he
 In order to make the price of petrol reduced by the VAT reduction by the states, the central government can also cut its excise tax
 vahiin dijal kii keemat ko jiesti main die gaye duusare or tisare tex dar par dekha jaae to dijal kii keemton main bhi 8 se 10 fisadi kii katautee karte hue keemton ko 50 rupee ke daayre main rakhi ja sakati hai

 The BJP, which won 46 percent of the seats in the municipal corporations, has won only 15 percent of the seats in the municipality and the Nagar Panchayat
 khaas baat ye he ki nagar nigam main jahaan iviem se voting hui thi vahiin, nagar panchayat or palika main voting ke liye matapatron kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 Opposition parties, especially Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati are raising questions on this
 bijepi par nishanabiespi supremeo mayawati ne bijepi ko gherte hue kaha ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se lekar vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne iviem se chhedchhad kii thi
 Accusing BJP of tampering evms even in the civic elections, Mayawati said that if the BJP does not tamper with EVM this time, our mayor would have won more seats and more seats
 unhone chunauti dete hue kaha ki agar bijepi iviem ke bajyballat paper se chunaavkaraati he to kisi bhi haal main satta nahin hasil kar sakati
 Like Mayawati, Akhilesh Yadav raised the issue of BJP and evms
 akhilesh ne twit kiya ki bijepi ne ballat paper ke ilaakon main mahaj 15 fisadi siten jeetin lekin iviem ke ilaakon main wo 46 fisadi siten jeet gai
 It is clear that Akhilesh is also linking bjp's victory with evms somewhere
 BJP has only won 15% seats in Ballot paper areas and 46% in EVM areas
 - Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh) December 2, 2017 Speaking on the election results, Mayawati said that apart from the Dalit community, the upper castes and backward sections of the society also supported the BSP and these are good signs for the party
 saath hi samaaj ke muslim tabake kaa samarthan bhi hamen hasil he
 He said that despite all efforts by BJP to disrupt the election process, BSP remained at number two
 unhone kaha ki bijepi bhale hi aaj satta main ho lekin hamen bharosa he ki na sirf bahujan samaaj balki anya samudaay kii janata bhi hamaare saath he
 Mayawati said that BSP has always wielded power on the slogan of Sarvajan Hitay and Sarvajan Sukhaya
 bhavishya kii ranneeti par charchaa karte hue mayawati ne kaha ki vah deshbhar main reliyaan karne ja rahi hai
 He said that he is also ready for the coming of the Sarva Samaj to unite against the BJP

 There is a general perception about body building that without injections and steroids (harmful medicines), health cannot be built like a big builder
 lekin 100 kilogram shrenee ke nae mistar world umesh is raay se ittefaq nahin rakhte
 Not only do they say, but they have proved that with adequate training and balanced diet, if given enough time, one can build good health

 His experience states that to make health, basic things like protein, amino, vitamin d and calcium are needed, which are completed by many good and authentic products available in the market, and do not cause side effects

 Umesh, who runs a gym in Indirapuram himself, explains, “there is a great demand for good trainers nowadays

 "but yes, the shortcut does not run on this path, rather its danger is high
" or deh dikhaane kaa shauk rakhane vaale log aksar haathon ke bicepse, seene, kandhe jaise hisson par zyada dhyaan dete hai

 In his words, "state-of-the-art machines are not needed to create health
 barbel, bench, wet, dambal jaisi buniyadi chijen kaaphi hai
 The right technique is needed

 According to Umesh, the fake Federation of bodybuilding has become a cause for concern
 ye tamaam compitishan karaate hai, lekin asar main inaki koi manyata nahin he
 At the same time, winning the competition of organizations like Asian Bodybuilding and Physical Sports Federation, Indian Bodybuilder Federation also gives an advantage in government jobs

 But when the video is from, it is not confirmed

 In the video, Sonu Nigam is seen requesting to behave sensibly with the fans while sharing the experience of the airport
 sonu nigam ne video ke jariye phens ko sencible hone kii salaah di he
 He said, understand the value of others' time, if someone is busy then don't bother him
 video ke mutabik airport main unhen ek fain kii vajah se thodi pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Sharing his experience, Singer said that i reached Mumbai from Delhi, waiting to get my luggage because of traveling alone
 tabhi ek fain selfi ke liye aayaa main unke saath self clic karai
 After a while the person came to take a selfie click with another person
 us dauraan main apane kaam main biji tha
 In such a situation, i told him that i am busy, i should first see my stuff
 itani si baat par wo janaab naaraaz hokar chalate bane
 i have seen many such fans who love me so they do not come, they just come for Facebook
 aise logon kii main koi izzat nahin karata
 i will request that if i am busy somewhere and you become arrogant on this
 aap sabhi samajhadaar hai, shikshit hai
 Value the time of others
 vaaki kamaal he
 Those who searched the street wo dilli main mili
 Amazing honey
 aapako to police haryana, upi, bihar
 
 nepal
 
 rajasthan or na jane kahaan kahaan dhund rahi thi or wo burka main rajdhani kii saiyr kar rahi hai
 By the way, this burqa saved a little shame from the police
 ab police ke paas kehane ko to he ki dilli main kis-kis kaa burka uthaa kar dekhte ki andar koun he? par hani ke pantare ko dekhte hue koi kaise yakeen kar le ki sisitivi main jo khatun burke main najar aa rahi hai wo sachmuch hani hi he? to hamane kuch khaas tareekon se is sach kii padtaal kii he
 Bad move
 baichaiyn saanse
 Scared look
 nazaron se nazaren churaati hui ye koun he
 Is it that somewhere? jise police haryana main
 Then UP, Bihar, Nepal and Rajasthan
 safed salwar grey kot or kaala scorf
 File and purse in hand
 sisitivi main kaid un tasveeron ke bare menhanipritka vakil ye daawa kar rahaa he ki wo video usee kaa he
 This record in CCTV happened when Honeypreet reached her lawyer's office in Lajpat Nagar to sign the advance surety papers
 haniprit ke haav-bhav
 Test his speed shield very closely
 kyonki yahi is baat kii gavaahi denge kii lajpat nagar ke is sisitivi main record hui ye mahila haniprit he yaa nahin
 The woman seen in the footage is moving her left hand full front and back while walking
 vahiin hamaare paas haniprit ke chalane ke jo reel or real footage hai
 Even when Honeypreet is seen walking
 tab bhi uskaa baayan haath puraa aage or peeche kii taraf ja rahaa he
 After the gesture, if you look at the way Honeypreet walks
 
 So you will find that when she walks, she uses long steps
 bhale wo dhime chal rahi ho yaa tej
 Consider the movement of the woman seen in the CCTV footage
 uske lambey-lambey kadam isi taraf ishaara kar rahe hai
 But some more important investigations remain before this can be accepted as true
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki haniprit bhes badalane main maahir or iskaa mujahiraa wo baba kii film hind kaa napak ko jawaab main kar chuki he
 In which Honeypreet stunned everyone by paying a 21-21 roll alone
 lekin isi film main ek role ke dauraan haniprit ne ek aisi mahila kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa tha
 For which he wore the burqa
 jo kot scorf style kaa tha
 This is exactly what the woman seen in CCTV footage that Jessapolis was wearing
 sisitivi main dikh rahi mahila or haniprit ko ek sabit karne ke liye sabase ahm or sabase zaruri he
 her purse
 footage main uske purse kaa color to samaj nahin aa rahaa he magar ye saise main bada he
 If we look at those pictures of Panchkula, you will find that Honey had taken this big purse of pink color here too
 sirf yaheen nahin balki jab-jab haniprit purse liye nazar aati hai to uske purse kaa style kuch aisa hi hota he
 So, should we assume that the woman seen on CCTV and Honeypreet have the same style
 kya vaaki main jis haniprit ko saat-saat rajyon or do mulkon main dhundha gaya wo rajdhani main hi chuphi banthi thi
 And if that is the case then it is really a wonderful Baba's honey
 jisane apni puri police force ko akele maheene bhar se chaka rakhaa he
 In the backdrop of the differences between Congress leaders about the government's move to remove most of the sections of Article 370 (article 370) in Jammu and Kashmir, Congress on August 9 gave its General secretaries-in-charge, State Presidents, State Legislature Party The meeting of the leaders of the party, the department heads and mps has been called
 baithak main is vishay par charchaa kii jaaegi
 According to sources, Congress (congress) organization general secretary KC Venugopal has written to the senior party officials informing about the meeting
 yah baithak nau agast kii shaam 15 gurudwara rakabganj road sthit party ke warroom main prastaavit he
 The party's top policy-making body Congress (congress) Working Committee also held a meeting on the subject of Jammu and Kashmir, passing a resolution calling the government's move unilateral and undemocratic, saying that Jammu and Kashmir is an internal matter of India
 And pok and the territory under China are also integral parts of India
 seedblusi ne kaha ki vah rajya ke logon ke saath khadi rahegi or bhaajapa ke 'vibhaajankaree agenda' ke khilaaf ladegi
 The Congress has called a meeting of its senior officials at a time when many party leaders have openly supported the government's move on Article 370
 isamen nayaa or pramukh naam varisht netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya kaa he
 Scindia, while supporting the government's move, said on Tuesday that it is a decision taken in the national interest
 vaise, sindhiya se pehle deependra hooda, milind devda, anil shastri, ranjit ranjan or aditi singh sahit party ke kai netaa jammu-kashmir par uthaae gaye narendra modi sarkaar ke kadam kaa samarthan kar chuke hai
 On the other hand, the official stance of the Congress is in opposition to the move
 uskaa aarope he ki sarkaar ne sanvaidhanik prakriyaaon kaa paalan nahin kiya he
 The party has opposed the bill in Parliament
 rajya sabha main congress ke mukhya sachetak bhubaneshwar kalita ne is mudde par ucch sadan kii apni sadsyta chhod di
 In fact, he was asked by the party to issue a whip to all members to oppose the bill
 uttar pradesh main raibareli sadar se congress vidhayak aditi singh ne bhi twitor par kaha, ‘‘ekajute ham khadey hai! jai hind
 # Article 370
 '' unhen jab yah yaad dilaayaa gaya ki vah congress kii ek netaa hai tab unhone jawaab diya, ‘‘main ek hindustani hum
 He called it a historic decision and appealed to the people not to give it a political color
 is bich, sutron ne bataaya ki aisa samajha ja rahaa he ki congress kaa sheersh netritv loksabhaa main party ke netaa adheer ranjan choudhary kii is tippanee se naaraaz he, jisamen unhone jammu kashmir ke aantarik vishay hone par sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki isaki nigaraanee sanyukt raashtra dwaara kii ja rahi he
 Just before the first round of voting in Chhattisgarh, the Congress has received another strong blow
 pradesh congress upaadhyaksh ghanaaraam sahu ne istipha de diya, or ab wo bijepi main shaamil hone ja rahe hai
 Ghanaram Sahu will join the BJP in the presence of Amit Shah on Monday
 iske pehle congress ke ek or kaaryakari adhyaksh or tanakhaar vidhansabha seat se maujuuda vidhayak ramadayal uike ne maheene bhar pehle congress chhod bijepi kaa daaman tham liya tha
 Ghanaram Sahu accused PCC Chief Bhupesh Baghel and MP Tamradhwaj Sahu of serious charges before leaving the Congress
 unhone kaha he ki ve naa keval unhen balki sahu samaaj ko pratadit or upekshit kar rahe he
 In his resignation, he has written that he is the party's vice president for five years, but now he does not have any question in the party nor has he been given any responsibility
 tamradhvaj sahu par aarope lagaate hue unhone kaha ki durg gramin se ek mahila pratyaashee kaa bi farm katkar khud unki seat par chunaav lard rahe hai
 Ghanaram Sahu said that no talk of any kind was ever made to him from the party
 yahaan tak unase poocha tak nahin gaya he
 So they do not want to stay in Congress
 chhattisgarh: congress yaa bijepi, pehle daur kii 18 siton par kise milegi badhat?ghanaaraam sahu, do baar avibhajit durg, jisamen baalod or bemetara jila bhi shaamil tha, ke adhyaksh rah chuke hai
 He won independent elections in 1972
 lekin lagaataar do baar bijepi se haarane ke chalate wo congress kii raajnneeti main haashie main chale gaye
 In the years 2003 and 2008, he contested from the Gundardehi constituency on behalf of the Congress
 is baar bhi unhone gunderdehi yaa durg vidhansabha seat se tikat maanga tha
 He even bought from the Gundaradehi assembly seat to Naaman farm
 lekin jab tikat nahin mili to unhone congressi netaaon ko jamkar kosa
 However, no one expected his entry into the BJP
 udhar unke bijepi pravesh ko lekar congress pravaktaa ramesh varlyani ne apni pratikriya jaahir karte hue kaha he ki unke jane se koi fark nahin padane vaala
 He said that the Congress party has fielded half a dozen candidates from the Sahu community
 isse is samudaay kii upeksha kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Ramesh Verlani said that his party has given tickets to the winning candidates
 bihar main pehali baar argedy kaa supada saaf hone or muhagathbandhan kii haar ke baad ab bayaanbajiyon kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 Senior RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has advocated the unification of small parties as the reason for Lalu's absence in the state after the election loss from Vaishali seat
 vahiin kabhi lalu ke khaas rahe patliputra sansadeey kshetra se duusari baar saansad chune gaye ramkripal yadav or kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne ise vanshavaad ke ant kii shuruyaat bataaya he
 Singh said that the biggest reason for rjd's defeat in the Lok Sabha elections is the party supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav being in jail
 unke jail main hone kii vajah se bihar main bhaajapa apni yojana main kaamyaab rahi
 He also said in gestures that it was better to form a grand alliance to compete with the NDA that only one party would have to challenge in the field
 raghuvansh ne kaha ki bihar kii sabhi kshetreey partiyon ko milakar ek party banani hogi, tabhi modi ko haraana mumkin ho saktaa he
 Significantly, the Assembly elections are due in Bihar at the end of next year
 aise main raghuvansh prasad singh kaa bayaan hindustani awam morcha, rashtriya lok samta party, vikasshil insaan party jaisi partiyon ke liye ek sandesh ke taur par dekha
 Ramkripal Yadav described the collapse of rjd's family as the biggest reason for rjd's defeat
 yadav ne kaha ki ek vah daur tha jab argedy main saamaajik nyaay kii baat hua karti thi magar ab parivaar ke nyaay kii baat hoti he
 The RJD has no face other than the Lalu family members
 vah keval ek parivaar kii party banakar rah gai he jiskaa har sadsy mantri, saansad yaa vidhayak he

 The survey shows that urban India is gathering more information about the local candidate from the Internet

 com Javed Akhtar's collection of poetry came years ago
 
 Kurratulain Haider wrote the role
 javed ne gajalen bhi kahi hai or najmen bhi, lekin unka jaadu najmon main chalaa; jaise vakt, wo cameraa yaad aata he, ek mohare kaa safar, meri aawaargi, bhukh, madar terresa goyaa unka trademark ban gayi
 But this is neither
 jmen jadid (aadhunik) najm kii us parampara se kaasi bhinn hai jo nun mim raashid, miraji or akhtarul imaan se chali aati thi, yaa jo majaaz, jaan nisaar akhtar, mashdum, ali sardaar jaafaree or caphi azmi se sambhddha thi
 Javed's new collection has all kinds of nudges from small to big
 unki bunat yaa sanrachana main ek cheez jo baar-baar aakarshith karti he vah he unki maansik jigyaasa yaa chintan or manan
 His contemplation is an attempt to discover the reality of a problem, solve complex and intricate knots, discover the secrets of the universe as well as the mystery of the human soul and life
 ye khel kya he, kaaynaat, ajeeb kissa he, bargad, bar vakt ek or khyaal in sab najmon main mulyon kii jigyaasa hi us maansikta ko darshaati he jo ki jivan ke bhedon ko paane yaa raajon ko jaanane kaa prayaas or justaju karti he
 Secondly, Javed usually employs small misers in the creation of nazams
 aisa nahin ki lambii baharon (chhandon) main unhone likhaa nahin
 Many ghazals are also in long lands, but neither
 jmon ko ve tukdon main baant dete hai jo ki silsilewar apni shabdic vishyatmakataa se parat-parat gaharaai main utarate hue puri kushalta or kushaagratha ke saath kavy ko srujit karte hai
 The third feature is that they question the question, the fourth is that in thinking these rank-by-status questions, they also keep the reader along and communicate, moving the lines in question
 paanchavin or ashri baat yah ki in na
 In thought, not only is the questioning question, it is also somewhere out of astounding situations: i think / what are these pieces / if i understand / what are these pieces / c
 rf lakdi ke hai khilone / to jeetna kya haarana kya
 The title of Najm is what is this game
 jaise-jaise vah aage badhati he andaja hota he ki baat shatranj kii nahin, jindagi ke khel kii he
 This victory and defeat are the problems of life
 shatranj keval paradaa he
 Kayanat is another such ghetto gir giraha najam
 vistrut brahmad kaa ek chor se duusare chor tak failaav jo anant he, yah ek aisa rahasy he jisko routine samajhkar aam taur se maanav behisi se guzar jaataa he
 But philosophers, saints and scholars have all struggled with this mysterious problem
 javed kii jigyasapurna drushti yahaan har drishy ko tatolti he, sochati he or prashn karti hui pathak kii samaj, bodh, aashcharya or vismay ko samvaad se sambhddha karti hui chalati haih main kitni sadiyon se tak rahaa hum / ye kaaynaat or uski vufat / tamaam hairat tamaam hairat / ye kya tamaasha ye kya samaa he
 
 
 Whom we understand is the plank / of which thousands of suns are melting in the form of firefly
 
 
 or ant main phir sawaalon kaa sawaal sawaal ye he / vahaan se aage koi jameen he / koi falak he / agar nahin he / to ye 'nahin' kitni dur tak he
 The voice full of thought and the edge of thinking is not small
 jmon main bhi milti he
 In neither
 jmon kii samasyaayein or prashn bhinn hai
 But the intellectual curiosity, the passion to find something and the style of self-confidence in the reader in questioning dialogue are the same
 ajeeb qissa he, bargad, shuda hafiz, aansu, jabaan aisi hi jiti-jaagti sochane par majaboor karti hui najmen hai
 As strange as it is on human relations, it is also on this problem that the desire to get an ideal or destination is in its yearning and searching, not in success
 kai baar safalataa or santushti apana paryaay bhi ban jaati he
 Banyan evokes memories of suburban culture that everything is alive, turning, people, way too but the village had a shade of belonging and coolness that has been lost in the cycle of time that cannot be brought back
 javed kii gajalen bhi itani hi chintansheel or marmasparshi hai
 Every lion of the Ghazal has a unit, but some ghazals have also adopted a sequential mode
 unamem bhi samaan bhavukta kii lay jahaan dhimi he vahiin bauddhik chintan or vidwata kii faja bhi he jo najmon main he
 The philosophical tradition has its place in Ghazal's semiotics, but Javed's style is different here too
 aksar inamen bhi jigyaasa, chintan-manan paaya jaataa he jo apana khaas lutf rakhata he
 The last nazm of this collection i count the vine wrapped in the tree in Javed's susceptible nazams
 isamen chintan or jigyaasa kii vahi sawaal karti hui rupakbaddh paristhiti he, vahi chote-chote misare, vahi aashcharya or prashn kaa vaataavaran he, jo unke srujanaatmak hastakshar kaa darja rakhata he
 Bell is a small thing wrapped in a tree branch
 ped kii khushboo or rangath usamen samaati chali gai, or bajaae khud yah ped ke vajood kaa hissaa ban gai
 There were hundred cases about the tree, there was no mention of the vine
 phir kaise aaj bel apni baahon main ped ke puure vajood ko sanbhale uski jindagi kaa sahaara bani hui he? bel apni baahon main ab he ped sanbhale / dhire dhire / ghayal shaashen par / pattey phir se nikal rahe hai / dhire dhire / nai jaden phooti hai / or dharti main gahari utar rahi hai / bel pe jaise / ek nai muskaan ke nanhe phool khile hai
 This poem aims to convert the harshness and despair of life into hope
 lekin yah ped koun he or yah bel koun he, jo aashaa or niraashaa kaa roopak or vyapaktaa kaa suchak he
 This bell is also wrapped in such a way that it cannot be separated
 yah sanket aavashyak he ki javed kii shaayari main bhavukta kaa tufaan nahin
 There are no thunderstorms here
 lava to he, aag bhi or chingaarion kaa drishy bhi he jise ham dekhte aa rahe hai, lekin vah ikhari romaaniat nahin jisaki tivrata or satahipan ne kuch prasiddh shaayaron kii shaayari ko bhaawanaaon kaa daldal bana diya tha
 The tree-wrapped vine is actually a battle of the storms of the past, and creativity is a sign of life and color-noor, with the help of which life is moving forward
 suraj ab kaa
 Fei has come forward
 ped aandhiyon or tu
 Has suffered the phanas
 shash dar shash lipati hui aantarik rachanaatmakataa or chintan manan kii bel hi he jo baahon main ped ko sanbhale hue he
 It has grown and spread with trees on every floor
 aaj agar isamen rango-nur he to yah keval ped hi ke liye nahin, sabake liye shubh sanket he

 Sachin Tendulkar has every right to name an entire series
 yahi kaaran he ki bharat or westeindies ke bich buudhvaar se aitihaasik eden gardens stadium main shuru ho rahi do maichon kii test shrunkhlaa ke pehle match se purv sirf or sirf sachin kii charchaa he
 There are huge cutouts and hoardings of Sachin outside the stadium
 ek hording par likhaa he-'tumhen sapane dekhne or unka peechha karne kaa haq he, kyonki sapane vaaki sach hote hai'
 Many players in the Indian team would have started their careers with this inspiring statement and today they are getting a chance to play with the greatest representative of Indian cricket and see them off while on the field
 sachin apane kariyar kaa antim test match 14 november se mumbai main khelenge
 The same Mumbai where he grew, grew and played, the same Mumbai whose air and air dwells in his veins
 isi kaaran sachin ne apana antim test apane shahar main khilne kii guzarish kii, jise bhartiya cricket board ne saharsha sweekaar kar liya
 It is like a small gift to a great player
 kolkata se pehle sachin ne haryana ke rohtak jile main sthit chote se gaanv lahali main apana antim ranjai match khelaa
 Due to Sachin, there was no place to keep mole in Lahli Stadium and after many years, it will be the same on Wednesday in Eden
 sachin kaa istakabal karne ke liye 65 hajaar darshak eden pahunch rahe hai
 Ever since Sachin has announced his retirement, he is the only talk in Indian cricket

 curator prabir mukherjee ne captain dhoni or coach dancan flechar ke alaava abhi kisi ko pich tak jane nahin diya he
 On Monday, he stopped Rohit Sharma from going on the pitch
 beete varsh eden kii pich nae tarah se banaai gai thi or tab se lekar aaj tak is pich par koi ranjai match bhi nahin khelaa gaya he
 Considering the rain of the past month, it has been estimated that the ball will be slow and low on this pitch, but Sachin has so much experience that he can sense the mood of the pitch
 captain ne pich dekhi he lekin iskaa raaj nahin kholaa he
 Now it will be really interesting to see what kind of combination he lands on Wednesday? He is very likely to play with two fast bowlers and two spin bowlers
 spin vibhaag to ravichandran aswin or pragyan ojha ke paas hi rahegaa lekin tej gendbaajon ko lekar dhoni ke chayan kaa intjaar rahegaa
 Local player Mohammad Shami may also get a chance

 Sammy has said that being a farewell series, he cannot allow Sachin to score a century and his team wants Sachin's wicket with the first ball
 ek taraf jahaan saimi or unke saathi sachin ko saste main out karne kii jugat main lage honge, vahiin duusari ore maidan or usase baahar match dekh rahe karodon deshvasi sachin kii safalataa ke liye prarthana kar rahe honge
 Now let's see how much fans pray for Sachin, who has scored a century on the prayers of fans hundreds of times

 India has made great progress and its middle class has grown significantly
 lekin karodon log ab bhi bheeshan garibi main yaa phir bhayanak tangahaali main jivan guzaar rahe hai
 This is the reason why Indira's policies are still relevant and are also adopted by anti-congress like Narendra Modi (bjp's official aim is to create a 'congress-free India')
 yah is baat ko rekhaankit karne kaa vakt he ki desh ke liye indira kii nitiyon ke kya myne hai
 Policies to eradicate poverty should include measures that can meet the immediate needs of the poor
 jis desh main kisaan kheti ke liye barish par betahasha nirbhar hon, jahaan jameen ke chote-se tukade par bahut saare log nirbhar hon, vahaan ek sookhaa bhi jivan-maran kaa sawaal ban jaataa he

 In such a situation, even though steps should be taken to promote economic development by encouraging wider investment and construction, policy emphasis should always be on removing poverty
 indira ke liye rajvanshajon ke privi purse ko samaapt karnaa ahm faisla tha kyonki isse yah sanket gaya ki ve sampann tabakon ko unki suvidhaon se vanchit karke garibon ke liye badi ladaai ladgaye ko tatpar hai
 It was like an ointment for the deprived sections because it strengthened them psychologically
 indira kii teesri baat yah jaahir karne kii thi ki chaahe netaa ke paas jitne bhi adhikaar or shaktiyaan hon par vah ek saadhaaran jindagi jeeta ho
 Indira may have as much desire or courtesy to keep close to or show her close association with a top class intellectual, but she lived life in a very normal way and was happiest with her family, especially her grandchildren

 karnataka bijepi pradeshdhyaksh bies yediurppa kaa kahana he ki unki party, karnataka main sattarudh congress-jedies sarkaar ke khud antarvirodhon se girane kaa intjaar karegi

 'purv mukhyamantri ne kaha, 'hamen aisa nahi lagata ki hamen chunaav ke liye janaa padegaa
 It is certain that they (congress and JDS) will go on fighting each other

 Modi on the footsteps of Vajpayee! Modi, following the footsteps of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, expressed his desire to take oath in the premises of the historic building of Rashtrapati Bhavan, so that more and more people can attend the ceremony
 isse pehle chandrashekhar ne bhi isi praangan main pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lee thi
 Although the beautiful Durbar Hall of Rashtrapati Bhavan witnesses such celebrations, but since there is a reception of 500 guests, a much larger venue was chosen

 jabaki film ke har gane ke pramotional events par arjuna sabase aage najar aa chuke hai

 viraat kohli ke liye gharelu tii-20 mahalig kaa ye sizan ab tak bhula dene vaala sabit hua he jisaki vajah unase kahin zyaada unki team ke superstars rahe hai
 For Virat, every win of the tournament can give him an impetus for the Champions Trophy to be held in London in June, while the doors of victory are still open for Punjab
 bengalooru main hone vaale match se pehle nets main abhyaas ke dauraan viraat kohli ke aatmavishvaas main koi kami nahin dikhi
 Captain Virat has so far scored 239 runs in 7 matches with 3 fifties at an average of around 35, which certainly cannot be called bad
 phir bhi viraat ke liye raahat ke pal maidan ke baahar hi nazar aate hai
 Virat is currently seen with his Bollywood actor friend Anushka, who celebrated his 29th birthday on 1 May
 lekin maidan par halaat ekadam alag hai
 Bengaluru, who have played the final three times, have not been able to win three matches in the tournament so far (11 matches, 2 wins, 8 defeats, 1 losing, 5 points)
 bengalooru or viraat kii fikr kii badi vajahen unke star khilaadi hi hai
 Genius AB de Villiers (196 runs) is injured, Kedar Jadhav, who scored the highest number of 241 runs for Bangalore, is colorless and ten thousand Chris Gayle (6 matches, 77 runs, 25)
 33 ausat, 1 ardhshtak) ke kya kehane
 Gayle will be praying for the end of this domestic tournament this season as soon as possible
 pawan negi (9 match main 10 wicket), yuzavendra chahal (10 match main 11 wicket) or caribian leg spinner samual badri (5 match main 9wicket) ke nijee aankade beshak utane bure naa nazar aaen
 But bowling has proved to be the weak link of this team
 tippaniyan Glenn Maxwell and the other stars of his team had to ride a bicycle these days for an advertisement
 unki team kii raftaar maidan par bhi kuch zyaada tej nahin dikhaai di he
 This team has won 4 out of 11 matches so far
 lekin is team ke play ofs main pahunchane kii ummid barqaraar he
 Hence, captain Glenn Maxwell seems to be trying to reduce his team's pressure on the nets
 mumbai ke kilaaf shatak lagane vaale hashim amala (8 match main 315 ran), form main dikh rahe martin gaptil (2 match main 73 ran) or 178 ke strike rate se ballebaazi kar rahe captain glen maxwell (9 match main 193 ran) bengalooru ke kilaaf jeet hasil karne kaa madda rakhte hai
 The success of his team can prove to be as easy as the Punjab bowlers show their strength against Bengaluru
 bengalooru ke captain sahit khilaadiyon ke liye ye saakh kii ladaai he jabaki bengalooru ke kilaaf jeet 2014 main final tak kaa safar kar chuki punjab team ke liye top for main pahunchane kaa shandaar mauqaa bana sakati he
 Virat Kohli's confidence was not lacking during practice in the nets ahead of the match in Bengaluru
 captain viraat ne abtak 7 maichon main qareeb 35 ke ausat se 3 ardhshtakon ke sahare 239 ran banaae hai jinhen yakeenan bura nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Yet, for Virat, moments of relief are seen outside the ground
 viraat in dinon apni bollywood actor dost anoushka ke saath nazar aa rahe hai jinhone 1 may ko apana 29waan janmdin manaaya he
 But the situation on the field is completely different
 teen baar final khel chuki bengalooru kii team abtak toornament main teen match bhi nahin jeet pai (11match, 2 jeet, 8 haar, 1 benatija, 5 ank) he
 Bengaluru and Virat's biggest reason for worrying is their star players
 jeniyas abi divilliars (196 ran) chotil rahe hai, bengalooru ke liye sabase zyaada 241 ran banane vaale kedaar jadhav berang dikhe hai or das hazari kris gail (6 match, 77 ran, 25
 33 average, 1 fifties)
 gail is sizan is gharelu toornament ke jitani jaldi ho sake biit jane kii duaen maang rahe honge
 The personal figures of Pawan Negi (10 wickets in 9 matches), Yuzvendra Chahal (11 wickets in 10 matches) and Caribbean leg-spinner Samuel Badri (9 wickets in 5 matches) are certainly not as bad
 lekin gendbaazi is team kii kamazor kadi hi sabit hui he
 The comments glen maxwell or unki team ke duusare stars ko in dinon ek vigyaapan ke liye cycle kii sawari kerani padi
 His team's speed has not seen anything too fast on the field
 is team ne abtak 11 main se 4 match jite hai
 But this team is expected to reach the play offs
 isliye captain glen maxwell nets par apni team kaa dabaav kam karne kii koshish main lage dikh rahe hai
 Hashim Amla (315 runs in 8 matches) scoring a century against Mumbai, in-form Martin Guptill (73 runs in 2 matches) and captain Glenn Maxwell batting at a strike rate of 178 (193 runs in 9 matches) from Bengaluru They have the potential to win against
 punjab ke gendbaaz bengalooru ke kilaaf jitna dam dikhaaenge unki team kii kamyaabi utani aasaan sabit ho sakati he
 It is a battle of credibility for the players including the captain of Bengaluru, while a win against Bengaluru can make it a great chance for the Punjab team, who had traveled to the finals in 2014 to reach the top four

 Team India captain Virat Kohli kept Mohammed Shami out of the playing eleven of the Indian team in important matches like World Cup semi-final against New Zealand

 Fans are constantly tweeting on Twitter asking BCCI and Virat Kohli why you have not included Mohammed Shami, the highest wicket taker in the playing XI
 shami kii jagah par bhubaneshwar kumaar ko team main jagah di gai
 While Shami's performance in the tournament is far better than Bhuvi's
 shami ne jahaan toornament ke chaar maichon main 14 wicket liye hai, vahiin bhubaneshwar kumaar pichley 6 maichon main 7 wicket hi le sake hai
 Shami was also ruled out in the last league match against Sri Lanka
 Virat Kohli has picked a team, if India lose this match, will have a lot to answer
 Dropping Shami in red hot form can be suicidal
 He goes for runs in death overs but picks up wickets with new balls
