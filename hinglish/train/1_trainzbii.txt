 The fight between the Aam Aadmi Party government and LG Anil Baijal, which is fighting for the rights in Delhi, is going on fiercely these days
 satta main dhai saal kaa safar tay kar chuki arvind kejariwal kii team kaa purv alji najeeb jang or maujuuda alji ke saath kai maukon par jhagada hona behad aam he
 But this quarrel has become a major reason for many government policies not being implemented
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya jhagade main uljhi kejariwal sarkaar, apane vaadon ko vaqt rahete puraa kar paaegi?alji daphtar or siem daphtar ke bich tanaav is kadar bad gaya he ki aam aadmi party ke netaa bhi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par iskaa asar hota hua dekh rahe hai
 According to AAP national spokesperson Ashutosh, if there is a similar tussle between the ministers and the LG, the pace of functioning will slow down
 haalanki party netaaon kaa maananaa he ki chuni hui sarkaar ko agar kaam karne se roka gaya to sarkaar ladaai karne kaa hi rasta apnayegi
 At the moment, these 2 cases have clarified how much tension has increased between CM and Deputy CM with LG
 1
 The first case is related to the Department of Health
 jahaan mantri satyendra jain kii bajaay khud mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne alji anil baijal ko chitthee likhakar sarkari aspataalon main staff kii kami ko puraa karne kii apil kii thi
 Kejriwal had also alleged in this letter with 'aaj Tak' that at the instance of LG, many officials were hiding the file related to health matters or refusing to give any minister
 pareshaan hokar siem kejariwal ne yah maang rakhi ki ab khud alji hi aspataalon main khaali pade padon ko jald se jald bharen
 2
 doosraa maamla upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ke kanoon vibhaag se judaa hua he
 Where, by writing a letter to LG Anil Baijal, Sisodia has accused of hiding the file and decision
 'ajtak' ke paas maujuud dipti siem ke sarkari note main likhaa he ki dilli sarkaar ke liye standing council or adishnal standing council kii niyuktiyon ke liye unki raay nahin lee gai
 Sisodia alleges that the authorities are not showing the file due to lg's order
 philhal, sisodiya ne kanoon vibhaag ke mantri ke taur par tippanee ke liye LG se dobaaraa fil maangi he
 Actually, there are questions on the 70 promises of the Aam Aadmi Party also because the government, which has a manifold budget in two and a half years, does not seem to be keeping its claims
 - haal hi main siem ne pushti kii he dilli sarkaar ke aspataalon main ventilator to hai lekin ise oparate karne ke liye staff nahin he
 In addition, there is a huge shortage of staff to run machines like X-ray, CT scan and MRI
 - mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal khud daawa kar chuke hai ki sarkari aspataalon main dawa counter behad kam hai
 - Earlier, the CM also sought a report from the Chief Secretary on shortage of medicines in hospitals
 - mohalla clinics ke project ko puraa karne ke liye jameen or jagah kii kami he
 LG has recently approved this project
 - premium bason ko lekar bhi kaaphi vigyaapan hue, lekin maamla alji daphtar main jaakar atak gaya tha
 Instead of solving the problem of water, ministers and mlas often quarrel with the officials of the Water Board
 - man mutabik tareeke se adhikariyon ke transfar-posting ko lekar bhi kejariwal sarkaar kaa alji se jhagada aam he
 Arvind Kejriwal's ministers often allege that officials do not listen to him
 haalanki AAP netaa ashutosh kahana he ki 'chuni hui sarkaar chupchaap nahidh baith sakati he
 He will fight every battle for the welfare of the people of Delhi
 jab hamaare vidhayak alji daphtar main jaakar baith gaye tab alji komohalla clinics kii filpas karne ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 If LG will appoint our lawyers and the file will not be sent to the Deputy Chief Minister or Chief Minister, then we will definitely struggle to get what we deserve under the constitution
 'alji par nishaanaa sadhate hue ashutosh aage kehete hai ki, 'agar dilli main is manshaa ke saath kaam hoga ki aadmi party kii sarkaar ke kaam main baadhaaen utpann kerani he, to chuni hui sarkaar ko janata ke haq ke liye ladaai ladani hi padegi'
 At the moment, it will be interesting to see in the coming days that the manner in which the Aam Aadmi Party had to stage a sit-in to pass the file of the Mohalla clinics, will this maneuver work in other cases or will the tension with LG in fulfilling the government's 70 point agenda Will prove to be a breaker '
 dillivaasiyon ko ab metro main safar karnaa mahangaa pad saktaa he
 The board of directors of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss this important agenda

 maujuuda daron ke mutabik, metro kaa kiraaya nunatam 8 rupee or adhiktam 30 rupee he
 Earlier, the fare was increased in 2009, according to DMRC officials, the Metro fare was increased in the first year of 2009, when the metro line from Yamuna Bank to Noida City Center was extended
 dmarsi kii daleel he ki in saalo main na sirf metro ke sanchaalan kii laagat badi he, balki kai anya kharchon main bhi badhotaree hui he
 In addition to the expenses of the metro has increased, while fixing new rates, it has also been kept in mind that many new lines of metro are also being started in the coming months
 teesraa phej puraa hone ke baad metro network kii lambaai bhi bad jaaegi or duuri ke hisaab se kiraaye main bhi fark aayega
 With this, by increasing the interchange station, passengers will also travel more distance through the existing network
 aise main adhiktam kiraaya nai metro line main dhyaan main rakhkar tay kiya jayega

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has advocated this change

 Earlier, the government had changed the old tradition of presenting the budget in February

 In such a situation, the budget session of Parliament can be held before December, according to the proposal which is being discussed to change the financial year

 Gandhi said that the Congress will not allow this to happen
 unhone kaha, ‘hamane faisla kiya he ki congress party bharat main har garib ko nishchit nunatam aay degi
 After the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress government will decide the minimum income
 yah kisi aay str (garibi rekha se) se neeche nahin hogi
 Addressing the meeting of Congress office bearers, the Congress President said, "we will not leave a single person
" ham aise logon ko khojenge jinaki aay nunatam aay se kam he
 We will deposit money in their accounts
 'saath hi rahul ne kaha, ‘jin logon kii aay nunatam aay (nirdhaarit) se kam he, unhen is yojana ke tahat paise milenge

 aam aadmi party ne maujuuda raajnneetik maahaul main apni ranneeti badalane kaa faisla kiya he
 The party's vocal voice and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia have been tasked to attack the central government
 isse pehle siem arvind kejariwal sidhe-sidhe centre sarkaar or piem narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate aae hai
 CM Kejriwal remains a bit quiet at the moment, while the Education Minister in his government has taken up the task of taking the troubles of the Delhi government and leading the attacks on the Center
 vah khaastaur par ek hafte se kaaphi zyada sakriy dikh rahe hai
 a party leader said that Sisodia's rise as the voice of the AAP is part of a well-planned strategy
 baikfoot par siem kejarivalpunjab or goa main AAP kaa sahi pradarshan na hone ke baad party main bahut se log maanane lage ki kejariwal ke daanv ulte pad gaye
 Now Kejriwal's attacks on PM Narendra Modi are not as aggressive as they used to be
 uparajyapal ko taanashaah qaraar dene or un par samanaantar sarkaar chalaane se lekar dilli sarkaar ke salaahkaaron ko hataane ke mudde par PM modi ko teen pannon kii chitthee likhane tak, kejariwal kii jagah sisodiya hi centre par hamalon kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Sisodia also held a press conference and accused the Modi government
 lekin party netaaon kaa kahana he ki donon (kejariwal or sisodiya) kandhe sekandha milakar kamkar rahe hai
 a senior party leader, on condition of anonymity, said, "when an enlightened decision was made that Kejriwal would slow down his attacks, then someone had to play that role and no one could do it better than Manish Sisodia
" 
 ’varisht netaa ne kaha, ‘donon ke bich najdiki kaa str yah he ki jab unhen koi kathin faisla lenaa hota he or ve shabdon ke aadan-pradaan kii sthiti main nahin hote to ve ek-duusare ko dekhte hai or sandesh chalaa jaataa he
 'the major reason for the decision is that the Delhi government is focusing on reforms in education and health sector and Sisodia is ahead on both fronts

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke thik pehle 20 march ko ek blog likhaa jiskaa sheershak tha—'sansthaaon kaa sammaan or sansthaaon kii avmaananaa-do paraspar virdohi approach'
 Through this blog, Modi launched sharp attacks on the Congress and its first family — the Gandhi dynasty
 iskaa saar yah tha ki desh kii sansthaaen congress kii 'vanshavaadi raajnneeti' kii sabase badi shikaar thim or 2014 ke chunaav main logon ne 'pehle parivaar' ke bajaae 'pehle bharat' kii bhaavana se vot daalate hue bhaajapa ko chunane ke saath itihaas banaaya tha
 Modi was not targeting the Gandhi family for the first time
 unke lagaataar tikhe hamale 2013 se hi jari hai jab unhen bhaajapa kii ore se pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 He did not leave any chance to attack Rahul Gandhi, from Shahzade to Naamdar
 modi yah baat lagaataar kehete rahe hai ki unhen congress adhyaksh kii kursi isliye nahin mili ki unamem waisi kaabiliyat he, balki isliye mili kyonki ve ek khaas parivaar se aate hai
 But when the Prime Minister next embarks on an election campaign, he may not get a chance to attack the Congress
 3 july kii subah, jab taapmaana 40 degree ke str ko paar kar gaya, rahul gandhi ne sansad main patrakaron ke ek samooh ko bataaya ki ab ve congress adhyaksh nahin hai or party ko jald hi unki jagah ek nayaa adhyaksh khojna hoga
 a few hours later, he posted a four-page letter on Twitter, stating that he had conveyed to the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25 that he was no longer the Congress president and he still held that decision
 
 aisa karke rahul ne kuch acolpaneey kiya he
 Never in the history of the Congress has anyone from the Gandhi family resigned from the top post
 beshak, vartmaan main congress vah party he jise unki daadi indira gandhi ne tatkaaleen congress netritv ke khilaaf safal takhtapalat ke baad 1969 main banaaya tha kyonki tatkaaleen congress netritv unhen pradhanmantri pad se hataanaa chahta tha
 The Congress leadership blamed Indira Gandhi for the party's very poor performance in the 1967 assembly elections in the major Hindi speaking states
 indira gandhi ne jald hi congress (aar) kaa gathan kiya, jo baad main congress (aai) bani or aakhirkaar 1996 main yah bhartiya rashtriya congress ban gai
 Although many veterans say that this will break the Congress, Rahul's close aides point out that this is not an impulsive decision nor a hypocrisy, but a carefully and thoughtfully taken 'political and ideological step' ' is
 modi apane rajnatik akraman main tark dete hai ki gandhi upnaam hone ke kaaran rahul party adhyaksh hai
 Rahul wants to throw that burden off
 unhone aksar apane divangat pita rajeev gandhi sahit apane parivaar par keechad oochhaalane vaale abhiyaanon par sakht naaraazgi jataai he
 This is the reason why he did not even hand over the command of sister Priyanka Gandhi
 unke sahyogi unke istife or party ke sheersh ko unke parivaar ke kisi sadsy ko saunpe jane se spasht inkaar ko, 2004 main unki maa ke usee balidaan ke rup main dekhte hai jab sonia gandhi ne pradhanmantri pad thukraa diya tha
 "he believes in what he said in 2013 in Jaipur," says a former party MP
 unhone kaha tha ki satta jehar he or aaj unhone yah sabit kar diya he ki ve raajnneeti main satta yaa takat paane ke liye nahin aae hai
 They are not moving away from the Congress, they will continue their struggle without office and set an example for millions of Congress members
 '' congress ke diggaj sweekaar karte hai ki yah rahul ko naitik rup se ooncha mukaam dilaaegaa, par jaisaa ki ek mahasachiv poochhate hai, ''ve kismen apana manmohan singh talash paaenge?''shaayad rahul ko apana manmohan singh ko khojane kii koi jaldi nahin he
 His resignation is also a message to a generation of Congress members who have failed to counter the RSS-BJP fabricated new electoral narrative
 25 may ko seedblusi kii baithak main, congress ke kai diggajon ne yah tark dene kii koshish kii ki aam chunaav main haar party ke liye koi nai ghatana nahin thi or ateet kii tarah congress phir joardaar vaapasi karegi
 Looking angry, Rahul had warned everyone that we all have come here to accept his responsibility instead of finding excuses and ignoring him
 chunaav haar gaye seedblusi ke ek sadsy kehete hai, ''unhone ek misaal kaayam karne ke liye istipha de diya
 They expect that those who sit in the main positions failed to give results, they also leave their posts and prepare the way for the new leaders
 ''2014 main congress ko isi tarah kii haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi then met about 400 Congress leaders and took careful notes from them
 un inputs ke aadhaar par, unhone party ke punaruddhar kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya tha
 But that plan never materialized; Many stalwarts and Sonia Gandhi assured him that such radical reformist measures would prove disastrous for the party
 agle teen varshon main—2017 main party adhyaksh ke rup main kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ke baad—ve diggajon ke paas pahunche or unke saath kaamkaaj ke liye ek swasth rishta viksit kiya
 In fact, the average age of their constituted CWC was 67
 phir bhi, 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unhen aisa mahasoos hua ki congress ke diggaj unhen pareshaan kar rahe hai or yah baat unhone seedblusi kii baithak main spasht rup se kahi bhi
 In a letter posted on Twitter, he wrote, "at times i felt like i am fighting completely alone and i am very proud of that
 ''pad chhodie kaa faisla sambhavat: is abhas se bhi prabhavit he ki hamaare loktantr main teji se badlaav dekha ja rahaa he or sambhavat: yah presidential-style ke chunaavon kii ore bad rahaa he
 In such a situation, if Rahul Gandhi has to challenge Modi's stature, then he will have to prepare himself anew
 unke ek sahyogi kehete hai, ''yah party ke vartmaan sanghathanaatmak dhaanche main sambhav nahin he
 Apart from this, Modi will always repeat his 'chaiwala vs shehzada' jumla
 modi rahul gandhi ko satta chhodie kii chunauti dete rahete hai, to lijie rahul ne chhod di
 "if the sources are to be trusted, then the plan ahead is very straightforward, making a new statement challenging the idea of BJP-RSS on India
 jaisaa ki patr main ullekh kiya gaya he or ve jor dekar kehete rahe hai ki congress ko sabase pehle bhaajapa ke pramukh vaicharik strot—aresas ke khilaaf apni ladaai chhedwai chahie
 He even tried to revive the Congress Seva Dal for this to counter the cadre strength of the RSS
 lekin yah kaaphi mushkil he
 Rahul Gandhi is facing two-way challenges: the burden of inheritance on his back and the lack of organizational support
 party ke ek saansad kehete hai, ''unhone pad chhodkar apane upar laden viraasat ke boj se mukti paa lee he
 They now need to formulate an alternative approach effectively
 asli chunauti yaheen aa khadi hoti he
 The Congress is definitely facing a leadership crisis
 pichley chah hakraton se party apana nayaa adhyaksh khojane kii koshish karne ke bajaae ek duusare hi haasyaaspad drame main lipt rahi
 The party not only needs to find a new president, but it will also have to remain united
 1991 or 1998 ke bich, rajeev gandhi kii hatya or sonia gandhi ke raajnneeti main aane kii anichhaa ke baad, congress ke do nirvaachit adhyaksh hue—pi
 V
 narsikwaha raav or seetaram kesari
 Kesri, the second elected president since 1969, was sacked in 1998 and Sonia Gandhi took over the reins of the party
 kesari ke kaarykaal ke dauraan, party main kai tut hui
 This is what makes the Gandhi family so indispensable in the Congress
 gandhi parivaar hi vah dhuree he jiske chaaron ore party gum sakati he
 Given this, the cwc's priority would be to find someone who is not only acceptable to everyone, but also loyal to the family
 kai naam phijaaon main tair rahe hai, par gandhi parivaar 'uttaradhikari ke chayan main' main kam dilchaspee dikhaa rahaa he
 In such a situation, it is not easy for the Congress think-tank
 ththcongress ke varisht netaa sweekaar karte hai ki isse rahul gandhi ko naitik rup se ooncha mukaam milegaa par ek party mahasachiv poochhate hai ''ve kismen apana manmohan singh talash paaenge?'' The upheaval within the Congress continues after a bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 party ke tamaam netaa haar kii apane-apane tareeke se samiksha kar rahe hai
 However, these elections brought relief news for the Congress from South India
 loksabhaa chunaav main congress ne tamilnadu main 9 siton par apane ummidavaar utaare the, jisamen se party ne 8 siton par kabja jamaaya
 At the same time the party also got 12 percent votes
 tamilnadu ke nateezon ko dekhakar kaha ja rahaa he ki bhale hi anya rajyon main congress kaa pradarshan kharaab rahaa ho, lekin tamilnadu main congress phir se apane pairon par khadi ho rahi he
 Let me tell you that the Congress lost power in the state in 1967 and after that it has become a hanger of the AIADMK or DMK
 ab apane pairon par khadey hone main congress ko kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Political analyst Ravidhiran Duraiswamy says, 'the Congress is definitely in a position to revive in Tamil Nadu

 He says that this time the BJP government will not be formed at the Center, along with it has expressed the possibility of conspiracy

 Jalaun SP District President Virpal Singh Yadav said that in the counting of votes, false exit poll has been shown to create mental pressure on officers and employees to make a mess

 Congress district chief Shyamsunder Chaudhary believes that since the BJP has a government at the Center and in the state, whatever pressure it may put on the officers
 agsit pole galat hai
 However, BJP district unit chief Nagendra Gupta said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has worked for nationalism and farmers, so people have voted for us

 On the other hand, non-bjp parties in various districts of Ruhelkhand have also denied the exit poll saying that the truth will come out on 23 May

 Congress candidate from Shahjahanpur, Brahm Swaroop Sagar Exit Poll is telling a hypothetical survey
 unhone kaha ki 23 taarikh ko yah tathakthith agsit pole kii hawa nikal jaaegi
 After Pilibhit, Hemraj Verma of the Samajwadi Party, a candidate for the alliance, says it is stupid to believe the exit poll
 jab 23 ko nattejey aaenge to uttar pradesh main mahagathbandhan sarvaadhik siten laaegaa
 The Mahagathbandhan candidate Afzal Ansari from Ghazipur seat in Purvanchal, defying the exit poll, says that there is a secret wave in favor of the Mahagathbandhan in Uttar Pradesh
 vah daawa karte hai ki sapa va basapa mahagathbandhan purvi uttar pradesh kii 30 seat main kam se kam 25 seat jeetegi
 On the other hand, Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party's National Chief General Secretary Arvind Rajbhar termed the exit poll as true, saying that if the votes of SP and BSP were combined in the last election of Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha, then the BJP will hold most of the seats in Uttar Pradesh
 Will be left behind
 vah kehete hai ki media sansthaanon main bhaajapa ko badhat dene kii hode si he, jabaki unke akalan ke anusaar bhaajapa bahumat se dur rahegi
 Even in Jhansi in Bundelkhand, political leaders have their own claims and apprehensions
 jhaansi basapa ke jila pramukh rambabu kaa kahana he ki agsit pole par hamen kabhi bhi vishwaas nahin rahaa or ham gathbandhan ke log to apane kaam par vishwaas rakhte hai
 The SP BSP alliance is getting 60 to 70 seats
 samaajawaadee party ke jhaansi jila sachiv abraar ali ne sawaal khadaa karte hue poocha ki jab desh kaa kisaan, majdoor, dukandaar, madhyam or garib varg sabhi pareshaan hai tab aakhir bhaajapa kii dobaaraa sarkaar kaise ban sakati he
 The forecast of Lok Sabha election results is completely under suspicion
 varisht congress netaa purv vidhayak brijendra vyas kaa kahana he ki agsit pole ke nattejey puri tarah se pryojit he, aisa bhraamak prachaar failaane ke peeche satta dal kii manshaa iviem main gadabadi paidaa karne kii he taaki deshavaasiyon ko pehle se hi maansik rup se taiyaar kiya ja sake
 Sadar MLA Ravi Sharma in bjp's Jhansi is excited by bjp's victory shown in exit poll and says that it was bound to happen
 desh kii janata ek baar phir modi sarkaar ko bahumat dene ja rahi he
 Overall, all the predictions made about the Lok Sabha election results are encouraging another BJP leader, while on the other hand, no opposition party is completely confident of these exit poll estimates

 Taking a sarcasm at the Congress, he said, 'congress was earlier in the affair of Raja Digvijay Singh, now it is in the affair of Maharaja Scindia

 On Saturday, the people of Bawri society gathered panchayat in a park in Raghubir Nagar, Delhi
 yah khap panchayat ek ladki or ek ladke kii shaadi ke maamle ko lekar shuru kii gai
 Khap says that if this marriage was done, nobody would be worse than us
 panchayat karne vaale log baawari samaaj se naata rakhte he
 Let us first tell you the whole matter, why did this Khap Panchayat gather? Actually, a girl named Rakhi and a boy named Amit want to marry each other
 donon ke parivaar bhi raji he
 But society does not agree to this marriage
 samaaj kaa kahana he ki in donon kaa ek hi gotra he, jisase ye donon rishte main bhai-bahan hue
 There is another twist in this story
 raakhi divyang he or uskaa ek haath kataa hua he, jiske chalate inke rishte nahin aate the
 Nobody wanted to marry this girl
 magar amit or uske parivaar ne raakhi kii is khami ko nakaarte hue shaadi kaa faisla kiya
 When he was asked if there was any problem in the relationship because of your handicap, his answer was yes
 raakhi ne bataaya ki divyang hone ke kaaran usase koi shaadi nahin karnaa chahta tha
 But now Amit is with me
 amit kaa bhi kahana he ki ham donon ko shaadi kerani hi he
 When Khap said that boy and girl have the same gotra, Rakhi's aunt changed their society
 darasal, raakhi kii buaa punjabi hai or unhone kanoonee rup se raakhi ko god le liya he yani ab raakhi gujarati samaaj kii nahin raheen
 She is now a Punjabi
 khayr raakhi kii daadi, jo baawari samaaj kii hi he, vah bhi yahi chaahati he ki donon kii shaadi ho jaae
 Rakhi's aunt told that they have adopted her
 raakhi kii didi kaa kahana he ki donon kii shaadi ho jaani chahie
 However, Khap says that we do not follow the law
 hamaara samaaj alag he
 Our laws are different
 ham in donon ki shaadi nahin hone denge
 Whatever happens then
 ab yah maamla bilkul fansata nazar aa rahaa he kyonki chah june ko raakhi or amit kii shaadi hone vaali he
 The wedding magazine has also been distributed
 ab is jode ko bharosa he, to sirf police par
 But it remains to be seen how the Khap Panchayat stops this marriage and how the police get them married

 ) Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a very big name of Indian cricket but currently he is going through a difficult phase of his cricketing career
 mahendra singh dhoni kii pareshaani kii vajah ek 19 saal kaa yuva cricketer he
 The funny thing is that this young cricketer's debut at the international level is the series itself
 lagaataar do vanade main kul 11 wicket chatkaakar mustafijur rahamaan ne world record to apane naam kiya hi, saath hi vanade cricket kii bahut badi team ko ghutane techne ke liye majaboor bhi kiya
 Regardless of the situation in the cricket field, the always calm-looking 'captain Cool' lost his temper during the first ODI, his fans must also have been hurt
 mustafijur ko joardaar dhakkan keval unke swabhaav ke vipareet balki khel bhaavana or unke kariyar ke dauraan kii sabase vivaadaaspad ghatnaon main se ek he
 Why not bat at number-4? Dhoni is known not only as one of the best ODI finishers but also for leading the team
 aisa unhone duusare vanade ke dauraan bhi dikhaa diya jab bahut dinon ke baad wo chauthe number par ballebaaji karne utre
 Three years later, Dhoni, playing on this position, scored a stunning 47
 is pojishan par dhoni ne ab tak 19 maichon main 72 kii ausat se 936 ran banaae hai jo unke kariyar record se kahin behatar he
 That is, once again it is proved that many former cricketers who advised him to get first in the batting order are right
 pehali baar saurav ganguli ne unhen is pojishan par utaara tha or tab dhoni ne pakistan ke khilaaf 148 ran jade the
 After this, he was often relegated to this position under the captaincy of Rahul Dravid and he never disappointed the team
 lekin aakhir aisa kya he ki itane achche record ke baavjood wo is pojishan par apni captaini main yada kada hi utre jabaki exparts lagaataar is par bolte or likhte rahe?2007 main team india kii bagdor sanbhaalane waalemhendra singh dhonine aate hi tii20 world cap dilaayaa
 World Cup in 2011 and Champions Trophy in 2013
 beshak pichley kuch samay se team acha pradarshan nahin kar rahi lekin kya iske liye keval dhoni hi jimmedaar hai? team ke anya 10 khilaadiyon kaa pradarshan kaisaa rahaa he? is par bhi gaur karnaa hoga
 Now if we talk about the record, then it was only the third defeat in the last 10 matches
 world cap ke dauraan lagaataar saat maichon main jeet darj karne ke baad pichley teen hi match haari he team india or is par unke virodh main swar tej ho gaye
 Bordadhoni himself is saying that if he wants to remove the board but at the same time he is saying that he is enjoying cricket, then he should be allowed to play for a few more days instead of being removed
 team ke captain kii bhoomika se jab unhen hataaya jayega to unki jagah hi khatre main padane vaali he yah bataur ballebaaj unki pichhali kuch pariyon ke pradarshan ko dekhte hue unke prashansak bhi bhalee bhaanti jaanate hai
 It is also not that Dhoni is currently the best available wicketkeeper
 aise main philhal unhen khelte rahane dijie kyonki jis tarah test se sanyas kii ghoshnaa kii usee tarah jab unhen yah abhas ho jayega ki wo team ke liye upyukt nahin rahe to wo swatah hi captaini hi nahin balki vanade khelnaa bhi chhod denge

 The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a warning to the coast of Odisha on 3 May when the super-cyclone Phni reached the coast of Odisha, evoking painful memories of the 1999 super-cyclone (cyclone 05B)
 us dauraan das hajaar se adhik log maare gaye or 1800 karod rupye se adhik kii sampatti nasht hui thi
 But much water has been washed away in the last two decades
 2019 main is chetavanee ko usee gambhirtha se liya gaya jitani honi chahie thi
 However, the Odisha government in 2013 succeeded in alleviating the catastrophic effects of another super-cyclone - felines and lost only 36 lives
 fani felin se kahin zyada vinaashkari tha lekin is dauraan keval 41 jaane hi gayi
 What happened during these fifteen years (1999-2013)? Odisha's coastline is in the grip of cyclones, but the devastation following the 1999 super cyclone created such outrage that the chief minister lost his chair and the ruling party was wiped out in the elections held only a few months later
 isse rashtriya or rajya, donon staron par rajnatik varg ne sabak siikhaa ki aisi kathin ghadi main bhi saamaanya rup se kaamkaaj chalaane or dhulmul prashasnic ravaiye se kaam nahin chalegaa
 The best example of this is the state government, which has lost few time and without waiting for any initiative from the central government, with few short term and long term preparations required to deal with the natural calamity like frequent cyclone
 Within months the Odisha State Disaster Reduction Authority (OSDMA) was formed
 pandrah varshon ke dauraan rajya sarkaar ke prayaason ke samanaantar, centre sarkaar ne bhi 2005 main nayaa kanoon aapadaa prabandhan adhinium banaaya jiske tahat akhil bhartiya niti or kaarykram sambandhi samanvay ke liye rashtriya aapadaa prabandhan agency (endieme) kii sthapana kii gai
 The NDMA has made several unprecedented efforts
 aapadaa prabandhan adhinium ke tahat sabhi rajyon ke liye rajya aapadaa prabandhan praadhikaranon kii sthapana ke nirdesh die gaye
 The central government has also amended the building laws and recommended the state governments to do the same
 isse taton kii raksha or bachaav upayon ke liye tateey kshetra niyam-kanoonon main bhi sanshodhan kiya gaya
 It also set up a network of Doppler radar systems across the country as well as modernized supercomputer calculus for weather warnings / dissemination of information
 1999 main odisha super-cyclone ke dauraan, mausam vibhaag se rajya sarkaar or jila magistriton ko niyamit rup se praarambhik chetavanee di gai thi
 The Meteorological Department had assumed that the state and district administrations would pass these warnings to local communities but this did not happen and the result had disastrous consequences
 uske baad centre sarkaar ne mantralayon, cabinet sachivalay or piemo staron par vibhinn samitiyon kii sthapana karke apni samanvay pranali main bhi sudhaar kiya
 The army, paramilitary force, air force and other agencies contribute to it as and when required
 darasal sunami ke dauraan chetavanee samay par rajya sarkaar kii mashinari tak nahin pahunch saki thi
 The Center set up a National Center in the Ministry of Home Affairs, which serves to deliver the warning locally
 endieme ne chakravaat hudahud ke prabhaav kaa adhyayan karne ke baad vibhinn kshetron main niti or kaarykram sambandhi ek suchi taiyaar kii thi
 a look at the recommendations suggests that the coastal states still have much to do in this direction
 felin or fani ke dauraan hataahaton kii sankhya ko kam se kam karne kii vajah se bharat ke aapadaa prabandhan ke upayon kii antarrashtriya str par saraahna hui he
 However, the success in reducing the death toll and the ability to provide immediate relief to the people is only part of the story
 punarnirmaan or punarvaas ke prayaas aane vaale hafton main kshati ke akalan ke baad shuru honge
 The lack of resources will really hurt both the people and the state government
 aapadaa jokhim beemaa abhi logon ke bich apni jaden jamaa hi rahaa he or vittiya sansaadhan hameshaa hi sansadhano kii kami vaale rajyon or rashtriya sarkaar, donon ke liye simit hote hai
 Therefore risk will remain bad in principle and in practice

 Srikanth came here to play his last role as the chief selector
 unki aguwai main irani cap team tathaa encapi salve chalanger siries ke liye bharat ‘e’ or bharat ‘bi’ team kaa chayan kiya gaya
 Srikanth said that the most important for the outgoing panel was Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team winning the World Cup
 unhone kaha, ‘jab ham chayansmiti se jude to ham sabhi kaa sapana or lakshya tha vishwa cap 2011 jeetna
 The Indian team did well and we managed to win the World Cup
 yah is chayansmiti ke liye sabase mahatvapurn kshan tha’ Most Android users use third party apps for file management in their smartphones
 sabase popular file management ap ES File Explorer he or daawa he or ise 500 million baar dowlod kiya gaya he
 It is also the most used app ever
 is ap ke jariye yugers apane smartphone yaa tablet ke files, data or documents manage karte hai
 Robert Baptiste, the French security researcher who has become quite popular and has now made a new claim
 unke kai twits kiye hai jinamein ES File Explorer ke bare main bataaya gaya he
 They have also said that ES File Explorer can be hacked
 unhone paaya he ki ES File Explorer ke paas ek hiden web sarwar he jo becoground main chalata he or ise koi bhi hack karke yugers kii jaankaree chori kar saktaa he
 Robert Baptiste has said in a tweet that ES File Explorer app is the most popular file manager, downloaded 100 million times
 chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki agar aap is ek baar open karte hai or koi bhi ek hi network par conect he aisi sthiti main wo remoteli phone se file apane divaais par le saktaa he
 With more than 100,000,000 downloads ES File Explorer is one of the most famous # Androidfile manager
 The surprise is: if you opened the app at least once, anyone connected to the same local network can remotely get a file from your phonehttps: / / t
 co / uv2ttqpucn — Elliot Alderson (@ fs0c131y) January 16, 2019 He has also released a video showing demonstration of how he exploits the flaws in ES File Explorer through a simple script
 isamen wo phone number, image, videos, eps or duusare android data nikaal lete hai
 While using it, they have performed demotion by collecting data kept in external memory of other smartphones
 aapako bataa den ki is khami se tab hi phayda uthaaya ja saktaa he jab smartphone yugers local network se connected hote hai
 That is, if someone is connected to another network, then he cannot steal the data of your smartphone through this app
 haalanki yah bhi kaaphi gambhir he, kyonki ek wifai se kaaphi log connected hote hai or kya pataa in wifai se koi haikar bhi connected he
 If the claim of this French security researcher is true, then it is a very serious matter
 philhal is ap kii taraf se koi statement nahin aayaa he or bayaan ke baad ham aapako apadet karenge
 Robert Baptiste is the same security researcher who pointed out the flaw in Aadhaar Security
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki aadhaar sicyor nahin he or iskaa data chori ho rahaa he
 Recently, he had tweeted to Narendra Modi that his website had flaws and his database could be hacked
 unhone piem modi ko khud privet massej main sampark karne ko kaha tha
 Later he claimed that Narendra Modi's team contacted him and work is being done to fix the flaw in the website

 In the home district of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Dalit family had to fight a long battle to build toilets in front of their house
 ye ladaai itani lambii chali ki shauchalay banavaane main parivaar ko do saal lag gaye
 lakshmipura-bhandu is a village in Mehsana district of Gujarat
 mehsana se gaanv pahunchane main zyada samay nahin lagata he, kyonki sadak pakki or sahi haalat main he
 Moving from city to village, one question bothers me again and again
 sawaal yah ki agar kisi parivaar ke paas apane liye shauchalaay banavaane kaa samarthy ho, usne saare samaan kaa intjaam bhi kar liye ho to shauchalay banane main kitna vakt lag saktaa he?shaayad paanch maheene, chah maheene yaa zyada se zyada saal bhar
 It cannot be more than that
 lekin, lakshmipura-bhandu gaanv main rah rahe ek maatr dalit parivaar ke mukhiya bhikhabhai senma ko apane parivaar ke liye shauchalay banavaane main do saal se zyada kaa samay lag gaya
 It took so long because they are Dalits and the Chaudhary family living around them
 choudhary pariwaron ko inke shauchalaay banavaane se dikkat thi
 There was a lot of paperwork in those two years
 yah puraa vakya farvari 2016 main saamne aayaa
 The news was made and then under pressure on the district administration, a toilet was built near the house of Bhikhabhai under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 is gaanv kii aabaadi kareeb paanch sau he or inamen zyaadaatar ghar choudhary jati ke hai
 Bhikhabhai Sanema lives in this village with his family of 13 members
 gaanv kii shuruyaat main hi unke parivaar kaa ghar hai
 Right on the road
 ghar ke chaaron ore khub hariyaali he
 There are many such plants on the front, whose branches have become one wall together
 jhaadiyon kii diwaar
 The house is clean
 har cheez kaayade se apni jagah par rakhi hui he
 There is a government tap near the house
 paas main ek jhopadi he, jisamen jalaavan ke liye sukhi lakadiyaan rakhi hui hai
 a large earthen pot is placed next to it, the fridge of the matka family
 inke ghar ke paas hi ek mandir bhi he, jisamen devi durga kaa ek calendar tanga hua he
 The head of the family, Bhikhabhai, is not at home
 wo baahar kisi kaam se gaye hai, lekin parivaar ke baaki sadsy hai
 There is an election atmosphere in Gujarat at present
 rajnatik gahamagahami vaale is maahaul ke bich is dalit parivaar ke paas aane kii ek mukhya vajah yah jaananaa he ki jis parivaar ko apane liye shauchalay banavaane ke liye do saal kii ladaai ladani padi wo aaj kaise rah rahaa he?yahaan aapako yah bhi bataate chalem ki jila mehsanapiem modika grih jila he or yahaan se thodi hi dur par he unka janmasthan vadnagar
 Senma is a young member of the Mehul family and is pursuing a BA from Sanskrit
 unke mutabik ghar main har vakt kisi naa kisi mard sadsy ko rahanaa hi padataa he
 He says, 'some man has to live in the house
 abhi pitaaji baahar gaye hai, so main yahaan hum
 'it may sound a little strange, but that's it
 unke mutabik sadak se jate-aate duusari jati ke kuch log fabtiyaan kasate hai
 He also abuses
 mehul bataate hai, ‘idhar sharaab pite hai or sadak se aate-jate kuch bolte hue jate hai
 Although no one teases us, but fear remains
 ’senma mehul sanskrit kii padhai kar rahe hai, lekin unke parivaar kaa koi bhi sadsy gaanv ke mandir kii choukhat nahin laangh saktaa he or isi vajah se inhone apane ghar ke baahar mandir banwaaya he
 His temple also has a picture of Goddess Durga
 shaayad ye vaali devi durga dalit hai!is bare main parivaar kii ek varisht sarita ben kahati hai, ‘ham unke mandir main nahin ja sakate hai
 Therefore, we have got our own temple built
 ’yahaan us ghatana kaa zikr karnaa sahi laga, kyonki is parivaar ke man main based bhay kii jhalak saaf dikhti he
 Sarita wants to talk to Ben in the yard of the house, but there was a hint from her that the conversation should not be done in the open but inside
 vajah yah ki aasapaas ke choudhary pariwaron ko pataa chalegaa to dikkat hone kii sambhaavna he
 (if you want to see this incident, then watch the video from 09: 32 to 10:01 minutes) Here, readers decide what is happening to their right to freedom of expression
 parivaar main ek yuva ladki he
 His name is Senma Rinku and his name is Nanihal here
 rinku vahiin kii beti he, jahaan ke bete hai piem modi yani rinku kaa paitruk nivas vadnagar he
 Rinku's father died long ago, due to which she is living in her nanihal and is completing her graduation
 bakaul rinku daliton ke saath hone vaale chhooaachhut main koi badlaav nahin aayaa he
 Even today the situation is the same
 wo kahati hai, ‘kuch nahin badla he
 Even today, we cannot fill water together
 saarvajanik mandir main to ja hi nahin sakate
 If they have a program and if we go to eat, then we have a separate arrangement, we eat there
 ham unke ghar main hi nahin ja sakate
 We stay outside
 agar unhen pani-vaani hamen dena hota he to wo upar se hi dete hai
 Still the same as before
 ’ek taraf beti ko bachaane or padhaane ke vaayade ho rahe hai
 There is talk of advancing daughters, while this girl returns home before dusk, because if an upper caste boy-man did something wrong with it and complained to his family, it is called That my boy was intoxicated, you were conscious, Rinku goes to college
 use wo sari badi-badi baaten maaloom hai, jo kitabon main daliton ko lekar kii jaati hai, lekin jab wo apane gaanv lautati he to halaat ekadam ulta paati he
 She just wants a government job after studying
 shauchalay ban jane ke baadayah parivaar apane ghar ke aage ek pakki diwaar banvaanaa chahta he, taaki sadak or unke ghar ke bich ek pakkaa pardaa ban sake
 At present, the screen work is done to some extent by the bushes that they have planted
 asal main parivaar ke paas koi bathroom nahin he
 The tap is also installed on the bus door itself
 parivaar ke mard sadasyon ke liye to koi dikkat nahin he, lekin mahila sadasyon ko nahaane se lekar kapadaa dhone tak kaa sara kaam isi nalke par karnaa padataa he
 In such a situation, the women of the family resort to darkness for bathing
 parivaar kii ek maatr yuvati rinku apane college subah ke das baje jaati he, lekin nahaati subah hi he
 When we asked her that question when you take a bath, she laughs and says, 'four o'clock in the morning
 jab andhera rahata he
 After the morning, i cannot take a shower, so i take a shower in the dark in the morning
 ’rinku apni maasoom hansi ke saath yah baat bahut hi sahajata se bol jaati he
 She neither complains to anyone nor bothers to say this
 lekin uske is ek jawaab se vikaas ke un daavon kii pole khulti he, jisaki charchaa indinon aam he

 Full State Jammu and Kashmir divided into two Union Territories
 In the new map of India, there were 29 States and 7 Union Territories in the map of India at the beginning of 9 years
 jab-jab nae rajya kaa gathan hua, bharat ke nakshe main rajyon kii sankhya judati chali gai
 But on October 31, the first time occurred when one state fell short of the map, along with two union territories
 yah tay 4 agast kii raat kiya gaya, jab centre sarkaar ne jammu-kashmir se vishesh rajya kaa darja waapas lene kaa faisla kiya
 After the verdict, on August 5, Home Minister Amit Shah introduced two resolutions in the Rajya Sabha
 pehla jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 (1) ke alaava sabhi khandon ko hataane kaa or doosraa rajya ko do centre shasit pradeshon main baantne kaa
 With both these resolutions, the Home Minister introduced the State Reorganization Bill and the Reservation Amendment Bill in the Rajya Sabha
 is bill ke paksh main zyada vot mili or ise rajyasabha se manjuuri mil gai
 After that the President got approval and it became law
 nae nakshe main 28 rajya, 9 centre shasit pradeshjammu-kashmir kaa punargathan 31 oktober ko aaazaad bharat ke pehle grahamantri sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii jayanti par kiya gaya, jinaki bhoomika bharat main jammu-kashmir kaa vilay karaane main ahm rahi

 yani ab tak purna rajya rahaa jammu-kashmir 31 actbur ko do centre shasit pradeshon main bant gaya
 Under the Reorganization Act 2019 of Jammu and Kashmir State, two Union Territories Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh came into existence and Ladakh became the Union Territory of the Legislative Assembly, with Jammu and Kashmir Assembly and without Legislative Assembly
 yah itihaas main pehali baar hua jab koi rajya centre shasit pradesh bana
 After this change, a new map was released with 28 states and 9 union territories
 jari nae nakshe main pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir (pioke) ke hisse ko kashmir kshetra main rekhaankit gaya
 At the same time, the map showed the division of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir
 isamen pioke ke teen jile mujaffarabad, panch or mirpur ko shaamil kiya gaya
 The map included two districts in Ladakh, Kargil and Leh, while Jammu and Kashmir included 20 districts
 iske alaava bharat sarkaar ne kargil ke abhi ke kshetra ko chhodkar leh jile ke kshetra gilgit, gilgit vazaarat, chilas, janajaatiy kshetra va leh or ladakh ko bhi milaayaa he
 This order was called the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Order, 2019
 jammu-kashmir centre shasit pradesh ke maanchitr main 20 jile shaamil hai, jisamen mujaffarabad, mirpur or poonch ke ve kshetra shaamil hai, jo pioke ke adheen hai
 In 1947, there were 14 districts in the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 inamen kathua, jammu, udhampur, riyasi, anantnag, baraamula, poonch, mirpur, mujaffarabad, leh or ladakh, gilgit, gilgit vajraat, chilhaas or janajaatiy kshetra shaamil the
 That is, there has been a big change in the map of India geographically
 30 oktober tak 29 rajya or 7 centre prashasit pradeshon vaala bharat 31 oktober ko 28 rajyon vaala bharat ban gaya or centre shasit pradeshon kii sankhya badhkar nau ho gai

 ek skool tha jo dhah gaya tha
 Little children on the rubble were counting the hills sitting on the sack
 pandraa ekam pandrah
 
 pandrah dooni tees
 
 
 
 ‘pandraa paanch pachhattar’
 The children were counting the hills by twitching the arms
 aisa lag rahaa tha jaise kavita pard rahe ho
 Vani Prakashan has published a collection of Gulzar's poems under the name 'fifteen Five seventy-five' in 2010
 is sangrah main pandraa paath he or har paath main paanch kavitaayen
 Gulzar's face is very large
 jisamen wo puri kaaynaat samet lete hai
 When they travel around the solar system, they travel from Iraq to Afghanistan
 wo iraq kii khanam kii gavaahi dete hai to gujarat ke un makaanon kaa bhi jo malbe kaa dher ban gaye
 Look 
 
 kitne masuumon ke ghar dangon main jalakarmalbe kaa dher hue jate hai gujarat main
 
 
 And here it is, in a broken day, it has to be decorated with three pieces! The arm of a weaver, shakes is still shaking or maybe something is hating of a player
 
 
 ran out hua he
 He was killed while running to the house
 kehete he deevaaron ke kaan hote hai lekin gulzaar in deevaaron ko jubaan bhi dete hai
 
 
 The ruins of the house in this backlight of the sun
 
 
 or deevaaron par baithe afgani bachche,america ke ‘art jarnal’ ke cover pej parab bhi jinda lagate hai!halkaa halkaa dhuaan nikalataa rahata he!!ek tanks achaanak ghar main ghus aayaa thajomeraat ke din, thodi-si, jo bhi mili, dafna aae ham!ab kanam kii phikr na karnaa abbu tum!!loktantr ke sabase bade utsav main netaji log jab apane apane devtaa pahchaan rahe the
 
 gulzaar unki pole kuch yun kholte hai
 As much as the settlement in the corner of a hill was like a temple, i had slept two arms as close as a locket, like the mosque, the temple of the mosque, the temple of the innocent, i slept under the old waterfall !! In the poetry collection, Gulzar appears in a new figure 
 unka canvas bahut bada he or rosemara kii choti choti magar manikej baton ko uthaakar vah ek nayaa landscape rach dete hai
 When he weaves the threads of senses with the tips of his fingers, everyone falls apart
 shaayad yahi gulzaar kii khaasiyat bhi he
 When it rains, then these gare stones start to get soaked on the walls
 
 a familiar person writes a writing
 shahar kii dakaiti main gaayab hote bacchon ko lekar hamaare samay kaa azeem shaayar kya kahata he
 
 taine ye bhi dekha hoga,shahar ko chaape maarane kii aadat he, meghatiohar dakaiti kare to bachche jeb main bhar ke le jaataa habche bik jate hai jaise rehadi par bhutte bikate hai
 In fifteen five seventy five, Gulzar has also fiercely practiced hunger and displacement
 wo khuda ko be-sabra baccha kehete he or us bachche ke baraabar bitha dete hai jo bhukh se bilabila rahaa he
 Kaal mai naini kol, gol se ek saiyare pareye kahi ko khuda ki khde hai sabra hai, it will grow up soon !! Kala maa keep a hand on the stove, how long has it been sitting, the raw grains should melt and a boil comes! -gabar is sitting in a round bowl with a round finger and the ball rotates sharply on the round plate, Gulzar has also given his pen to the victims of displacement due to hard dam
 teen pahaado bich bani is vaadi membandh banegaa!dame banegaa!teen pahaado main se rengta, bal khaataa jo sadiyon se bahata aayaa hekundali maar ke baithegaa wo dariyaa ab is vaadi menisi kitaab main ashok vaajapeyi kehete hai ki agar aaj ke samay main gulzaar sabase zyada pyaar paane vaale kaviyon or shiron main se ek he to isliye ki unki kavitaaon main ravaayat kaa boj nahin he
 He says the same thing once and there is no impatience in his poems
 unki kavitaaon main apni duniya yaa anubhav ko ham anugunjit pate hai
 The last word left is shama, that of Shama Hijra 
 If hope is left, then just as much as an infertile womb will be expected, everything is spoken here
 or jab bolti he to ‘aasmaan kii canpattiyaan pakane lagati hai’
 'A piece of incense sits like a scarecrow in the lawn'
 
 'even i left my body and got swept away in the river
 ' nadi, aasmaan, parinde kya yatharth nahin he
 And this is the reality that Gulzar has taken piece by piece from himself and our lives
 kabhi kabhi jab utarati he chil shaam kii chat sethki thakee si jaraa der lon main rukkarsafed or gulabi, ‘musunde’ ke paudon main ghulne lagati heki jaise barf kaa tukdaa pighalta jaae whisky menmain ‘scorf’ din kaa gale se utaar detaa huntere utaare hue din pahanke ab bhi manteri mahak main kai roj kaat detaa hum!!yah bhi
 
 mujhe meraa jism chhodkar bah gaya nadeen main!ab us kinare pahunch ke mujhako bula rahaa haimain is kinare pe duubataa ja rahaa pahamamen kaise tairun bagaiyr uske!!mujhe meraa jism chhodkar bah gaya nadi main!!
 
 
 In the end, all that will be said is that when Gulzar 'blows blessings' through his poems, his loved ones start getting 'hiccups'

 congress ke varisht netaa or rajyasabha sadsy motilal vora ne aaj yani 30 july ko rajyasabha main ISRO vaigyanikon kii tankhwaah kaatane kaa maamla uthaaya
 He said that when the entire country is congratulating them on the success of ISRO scientists after the launch of Chandrayaan-2, the Government of India is cutting their salary
 isro vaigyanikon ke liye do atirikt vetan vruddhi kii anumati raashtrapati ne di thi
 So that the best talent present in the country is encouraged to become ISRO scientist
 saath hi isro vaigyanik bhi prerit ho sake
 Motilal Vora said that these additional increments were implemented by the Department of Space in 1996 after the Supreme Court order
 supreme court ne aadesh main kaha tha ki is vetan vruddhi ko spasht taur par 'tankhwaah' mana jaae
 Motilal Vora appealed in the House that the central government should not cut the salary of ISRO scientists
 padhein
 
 
 Aaj Tak first reported that the government cut the salary of ISRO scientists, a letter written by ISRO Scientists Organization to ISRO Chief
 bharat sarkaar ne Chandrayaan-2 kii lonching se thik pehle ISRO vaigyanikon kii tankhwaah main katautee kar di thi
 The Central Government has said in an order issued on 12 June 2019 that ISRO scientists and engineers have been getting two additional increments since the year 1996, the incentive grant amount is being discontinued
 ye haal tab he jab isro ke vaigyanikon kii uplabdhi par puure desh ko garv he
 The Space Engineers Association (SEA), an organization of ISRO scientists, has named ISRO Chairman Dr
 ke
 Wrote a letter to Sivan and demanded that he help cancel the order of the Central Government, which cut the salary of ISRO scientists
 kyonki vaigyanikon ke paas tankhwaah ke alaava kamai kaa koi anya jariya nahin he
 SEA President A
 maniraman ne isro chif ko likhe patr main kaha tha ki sarkari karmchaaree kii tankhwaah main kisi bhi tarah kii katautee tab tak nahin kii ja sakati, jab tak behad gambhir sthiti na khadi ho jaae
 Salary cuts will reduce the enthusiasm of scientists
 ham vaigyanik centre sarkaar ke faisle se behad hairat main hai or dukhi hai
 Letter from ISRO Scientists: We are shocked and very sad
 
 
 SEA ne isro chif ko likhe patr main binduvaar ye maange rakhi hai
 
 
 Two additional increments for ISRO scientists were given by the President
 taaki desh main maujuud behtareen talents ko isro vaigyanik banane kaa protsaahan mili
 Also, ISRO scientists could also be inspired
 ye atirikt vetan vruddhi supreme court ke aadesh ke baad 1996 main antariksh vibhaag ne lagu kiya tha
 The Supreme Court order said that this increment should be clearly considered as 'salary'
 chathe vetan ayog main bhi is vetan vruddhi ko jari rakhane kii sifarish kii gai thi
 It was also said that ISRO scientists should continue to get its benefits
 do atirikt vetan vruddhi isliye lagu kiya gaya tha ki isro main aane vaale yuva vaigyanikon ko niyukti ke samay hi prerana mil sake or ve isro main lambey samay tak kaam kar saken
 The Central Government order mentions the Performance Related Incentive Scheme (PRIS)
 ham yah bataanaa chaahate hai ki atirikt vetan vruddhi or PRIS donon hi puri tarah se alag-alag hai
 One is incentive, while the other is salary
 donon ek duusare kii purti kisi bhi tarah se nahin karte
 No deduction in the salary of a government employee can be made until a very serious situation arises
 ye tha centre sarkaar kaa tankhwaah kaatane vaala aadeshis aadesh main kaha gaya he ki 1 july 2019 se yah protsaahan raashi band ho jaaegi
 After this order, scientists of the D, E, f and g category will no longer get this incentive
 isro main kareeb 16 hajaar vaigyanik or ejeeniyar hai
 But by this government order, about 85 to 90 percent of isro's scientists and engineers will lose 8 to 10 thousand rupees
 kyonki zyaadaatar vaigyanik inhen shreniyon main aate hai
 ISRO scientists are angry about this
 bataa den ki vaigyanikon ko protsaahit karne, isro kii ore unka jhukaav badhaane or santhaan chhodkar nahin jane ke liye varsh 1996 main yah protsaahan raashi shuru kii gai thi
 The order issued by the central government said that on the basis of the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission, the Finance Ministry and the Department of Expenditure have advised the Department of Space to discontinue this incentive
 isaki jagah ab sirf parformens related incentive skim (PRIS) lagu kii gai he
 Till now ISRO was providing both incentive and PRIS scheme facilities to its scientists
 lekin ab centre sarkaar ne nirnay kiya he ki atirikt vetan ke taur par di jane vaali yah protsaahan raashi 1 july se milani band ho jaaegi
 Recruitment of ISRO scientists is in c category, the incentive amount used to be given on promotion
 Recruitment of any scientist in ISRO starts from c category
 iske baad unka pramotion D, E, F, g or aage kii shreniyon main hota he
 Each category has a test before promotion
 use paas karne vaale ko yah protsaahan anudaan raashi milti he
 But now when the salary of July comes in August, then scientists will see a cut in it
 vraton main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn vrath ekadshi kaa hota he
 The fasting of Ekadashi ends the agility of the mind
 dhan or aarogy kii prapti hoti he, hormone se judi samasyaayein bhi thik hone ke saath manorog bhi dur hote hai
 The fast of Putrada Ekadashi is a fast for the attainment of children and the prevention of child problems
 sawan kii putrada ekadshi vishesh faldaayi maani jaati he
 By keeping this fast, every child related concern and problem is eliminated
 is baar sawan kii putrada ekadshi 11 agast ko he
 What are the rules to keep this fast? - This fast is kept in two ways - anhydrous fast and Falahari or aqueous fast
 - saamanytah nirjal vrath purna rup se swasthy vyakti ko hi rakhana chahie
 - Other or normal people should keep fasting or aquatic fast
 - behatar hoga ki is din keval jal or fal kaa hi seven kiya jaae
 Lord Krishna or Shri Narayana should be worshiped on this day of Ekadashi for child-related desires
 santan kii kaamana ke liye kya karen?- praatah kaal pati-patni sanyukt rup se shri krishna kii upasna karen
 - Offer them yellow fruits, yellow flowers, tulsi dal and panchamrit
 - iske baad santan gopal mantra kaa jaap karen
 - After chanting the mantra, the husband and wife jointly receive the offerings
 - agar is din upwas rakhkar prakriyaaon kaa paalan kiya jaae to zyada acha hoga
 What is Santan Gopal Mantra? - "om Klin Devaki Sut Govind Vasudev Jagatpate, Tanay Krishna Krishna Tvamham Sharanam Gata" - "om Klin Krishna Namaah" dilli sarkaar rajdhani main shiksha ke naam par karodon kharch karne kaa daawa karti he
 But the CAG report has rubbished the government's claims
 haalanki shiksha mantri kaig kii report par hi sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 According to Education Minister Arvinder Singh Lovely, there is no dearth of education in Delhi schools
 kaig kii report ke anusaar dakshin dilli ke ambedkar nagar ke ek skool main 700 bacchon ko padhaane ke liye sirf do hi teacher hai
 It has been almost a year since the school opened at a cost of crores, but the students are still waiting for the teachers
 ilaake ke bijepi parshad bhi is badahaali ke liye shila sarkaar ko hi kos rahe hai
 BJP councilor Kushi Ram says that there is a Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Ambedkar Nagar which has only one teacher and one principal, it has been an open year which is a sad thing
 shiksha kaa girtaa str ye shila dikshit ke saamne he
 Ram's trust here is the education of children and the government is not ready to do anything
 shila sarkaar rhite tu ajukeshan ke naam par karodon kharch karne kaa daawa to karti he lekin hakeekat main ye daawey khokhale sabit ho rahe hai
 The CAG report also exposed the claims of these claims, but the Sheila government ministers have not failed to question even the CAG report
 bihar ke mujffarpur jile main chamaki bukhaar se 10 din main 47 bacchon kii maut ho gai he
 This matter has also come up in the international media
 angreji website daily mail or da gargian main prakashit report ke anusaar bacchon kii maut ek aise jahrile padaarth kii vajah se hui he jo lichi main paaya jaataa he
 According to the report, almost identical symptoms of acute encephalitis syndrome have been found in all children who die
 in sabhi bacchon ke blad sample main sugar level bhi ausat se kam paaya gaya he
 The two hospitals in Muzaffarpur, where the deaths of children have been reported, are known for the litchi orchards
 yahaan bade paimaane par lichi kaa utpaadan hota he or iske baad ise desh-videsh main pahunchaaya jaataa he
 Therefore, it has become very important to investigate whether the children are dying due to the poisonous element found in lychee
 jile ke varisht swasth adhikari ashok kumaar singh ne angreji website ke hawaale se bataaya ki mrit bacchon main acute inseflitis syndrome ke samaan lakshan paae gaye hai
 Sugar was also very low in the blood of children
 adhikari ne bataaya ki jis jahrile padaarth ke kaaran bacchon kii maut hui he wo lichi main paaya jaataa he
 At the same time, SPC Singh, Chief Medical Officer of Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital, quoted the Daily Mail and The Guardian as saying that almost identical symptoms of encephalitis have been found in 40 children
 peedit bacchon ke ilaaj ke liye alag se care unit bhi banaaya gaya he
 At present, the condition of children is very serious and they are doing their best to save them
 24 saalon main badi samasya-bihar ke mujffarpur or iske padosi jilon main yah maamla koi nayaa nahin he
 Since 1995, such complaints have been continuously coming here in the summer season
 yani pichley 24 saalon main yah samasya kaaphi zyada badi he
 Ashok Kumar Singh said that the health department has already issued advisory here after the temperature has crossed 40 degrees
 kya kehete hai shodhakarta-bihar ke local ilaakon main is beemaari ko chamaki bukhaar kaha jaataa he
 In the year 2014 also, there were about 150 cases of this fever
 dimag main hone vaale is ghaatak bukhaar par saal 2015 main america shodhakartaaon ne bhi khoj kii thi
 Research has revealed that this poisonous substance can be related to any fruit
 pichley dinon vishwa swasthya sanghathan kii report ke anusaar adhpaki lichi ko bhi insaan ke liye khatarnaak bataaya gaya tha
 a particular type of element found in lychee may be the cause of this fever
 kyon he lichi khatarnaak-swaadisht or mithi lichi kisi kii maut kaa kaaran ban sakati he, is tark par vishwaas karnaa thodaa mushkil he
 But if some things are not taken special care in eating litchi, then it can be dangerous
 khaali pet or kachi lichi khaane se inseflitis kaa khatra kaaphi bad jaataa he
 Even if you sleep on an empty stomach eating litchi, it can prove to be dangerous
 lichi se nikalne vaala jaharila padaarth sharir main sugar kii ausat maatra ko kam kar detaa he
 Apart from this, malnourished children should also not eat litchi
 kya he ilaaj-chamaki bukhaar se peedit insaan ke sharir main pani kii kami na hone den
 Only give healthy food to children
 raat ko khaanaa khaane ke baad halkaa-phulka meetha jarur den
 According to Civil Surgeon SP Singh, hypoglycemia, ie a lack of sugar, is being seen in the children with skin
 philhal jile ke sabhi praathmik swasthya kendron ko hai alert par rakhaa gaya he
 Appropriate arrangements have been made for the treatment of children suffering from fever
 doctoron kaa kahana he ki bacchon ko thodi-thodi der baad taral padaarth dete rahen taaki unke sharir main pani kii kami na ho

 argedy ke purv saansad or bahubali netaa mohammad shahabuddin kii rihaai par bijepi ne jamkar hamalaa bolaa he
 BJP has blamed Nitish Kumar government of Bihar for this
 bihar bijepi ke varisht netaa susheel modi ne 'aaj tak' ke saath khaas baatcheet main kaha ki maamalon ko kamjor kar shahabuddin kii rihaai kaa rasta taiyaar kiya gaya
 The dilemma Modi given in the case said that Shahabuddin's release was in connivance with the state government
 trial prarambh nahin hua or trial prarambh ho jaataa to bel nahin milti
 He questioned why junior lawyers were hired
 bade vakeelon ko cese main kyon nahin lagaaya gaya
 Why did not put CCA? Targeting the JDU-RJD government, Sushil Modi said that CCA (crime Control Act) was imposed in Anant Singh's case but Shahabuddin was not imposed CCA
 kya unke baahar aane se lau and order kharaab nahin hoga? susheel modi ne kaha ki nitish kumaar majaburi ke mukhyamantri banakar baithe hai
 On Shahabuddin's statement that he did not take Sushil Modi's words serially, he said that if he had taken my words seriously, he would not have been a criminal
 kanoon-vyavastha bigadegisushil modi ne kaha, 'nitish ji ko sarkaar chalaanaa he to laluji kii baat ko lekar chalanaa hoga
 It may be that Shahabuddin rightly said that Nitish is the Chief Minister of the circumstances and maybe someone else becomes the Chief Minister
 nitish kumaar jor-jor se bhi bole ki bihar main kanoon kaa raaj he lekin bihar main lau and order kharaab ho gaya he
 He compromised with the principles
 He said that Nitish Kumar will have to follow the talk of Lalu and Shahabuddin or else the Chief Minister cannot stay for long
 ve mukhyamantri banane ke liye siddhanton se bhi samjhauta kar sakate hai
 Sushil Modi said that on Tuesday we will sit in every district
 ham maang karenge ki shahabuddin par CCA lagaaya jaae

 kanpur vanade main haar ke liye team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ne khule taur par viraat kohli ko doshi bataaya tha
 Now another thing is coming out that there was a strong debate between these two before this match
 kanpur main ravivaar ko bharat or dakshin africa ke bich hue pehle ekadivasiy mukaable kii purv sandhya par dhoni or kohli ke bich yah bahes ajinkya rahane ko team main shaamil karne ko lekar hui thi
 Even during the match, when Kohli was fielding at the boundary and Dhoni asked him to change the place, he did not take it seriously
 team india vah machpanch ranon se hargai thi
 However Ajinkya Rahane was also included in the final XI and also scored a very important 60 runs, proving his selection worthwhile
 saath hi unhonerohit sharma(150) ke saath duusare wicket ke liye 149 ranon kii ahm saajhedaari bhi kii
 Both the skipper clashed with Rahane, who was more surprised to know Rahane was included in the playing XI than sending Rahane in third order above Kohli
 team kii ghoshnaa ke vakt rahane ke liye chauthaa kram nirdhaarit hua tha
 At the time when Shikhar Dhawan was out, India had scored 42 runs and Rohit was playing well, so stopping the more talented Kohli than Rahane and sending him to Rahane surprises everyone
 match ke baad samvaadadaataaon ne jab dhoni se kohli ke saath sambandhon main khatas ke bare main jaananaa chaha tha, jo unhone isse inkaar kiya tha
 Dhoni had told the press conference before the match that there is no vacancy in the team for Rahane right now because naturally he is the first, second or third order player but currently all three slots are booked in our team
 captain ne yah bhi kaha tha ki rahane ko chauthe yaa phir usase neech ke kram par khilaanaa unki tauheen hogi kyonki vah swaabhaavik taur par upar ke kram ke khilaadi hai
 In such a situation, it is not possible for him to play in Kanpur
 media ne agle din is khabar ko pramukhataa di thi or saath hi yah maan liya tha ki rahane kanpur main antim ekadash kaa hissaa nahin honge
 Despite this, Rahane was included in the team and landed in third order
 iske baad maidan main bhi ek naatakeey drishy dekha gaya
 While fielding at long off, Kohli enthralled the spectators on that side's stand
 yah vah vakt tha, jab abraham divilliars or phalf du plasis bhartiya gendbaajon kii khabar le rahe the
 Kohli did not listen to Dhoni's talkers and used to chant 'kohli-kohli' in between
 is bich kuch maukon par dhoni ne unhen sthaan parivartit karne ke liye ishaara bhi kiya lekin kohli ne use adhik gambheertha se nahin liya
 He was busy in conducting a referendum for himself
 match ke baad dhoni ne isaki bharpai kohli kii khinchaai karke kii
 Not taking names, Dhoni said that we should have scored fast around 35 overs
 gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki us match main kohli ne 18 gendon par 11 ran banaae the or unka wicket 40wein over kii antim gend par 214 ran ke kul yoga par gira tha
 It is clear that Dhoni left no stone unturned to target Kohli
 isaki vajah saaf he
 Since Dhoni made the statement that Rahane does not rotate strikes and because of this, he is not fit for the ODI team, the differences between Dhoni and Kohli started
 bataur test captain kohli ne rahane ko har match main khilaayaa or rahane ne bhi captain kii ummiido ko jiya
 He is a successful player of all three formats
 aise main na jane dhoni ne rahane ko lekar ajeebogareeb bayaan kyon diya
 Experts believe that while doing so, he wanted to keep Rahane outside and his 'favorite' players inside
 dhoni ne dabaav main rahane ko shaamil kiyakanpur main rahane ko team main shaamil karnaa dhoni kii vistrut soch or team hit main liya gaya faisla laga tha lekin yah kuch or hi niklaa
 The fact is that in the team management meeting on the eve of the match, team director Ravi Shastri asked Dhoni to add Rahane to the team as he is in good form
 dhoni ne asamarthta jataai lekin is shart par maan gaye ki kohli ko nambar-4 par janaa hoga
 Kohli agreed to this after a bit of naughtiness, but his bat got angry in the field
 ab unka balla jaanboojhkar ruthaa yaa phir koi or baat he yah to viraat hi bataa sakate hai lekin bharat yah match haar gaya
 And then it is also common that the board will decide the future of Dhoni as one-day captain based on the outcome of this series
 kahin aisa to nahin ki viraat chaahate hi nahin ki bharat yah siries jite hi nahin?ganguli ne kii matbhed kii pushtibhartiya team ke purv captain saurav ganguli ne dhoni or kohli ke bich hui is bahes kii charchaa fasebuk par kii he
 According to Ganguly, this kind of relationship between two senior players of the team is not a good thing
 isse team ko nuksaan hoga or yah behad chaunkaane vaali baat he
 From childhood, mothers also scold children for drinking milk and explain its benefits
 doodh main vitamin e, ke or bi 12, thymin or nicotinic acid, mineral jaise- calcium, phosphorus, sodium or potacium paae jate hai, jo haddiyon ke liye bahut phydemand he or isse hamen takat milti he
 It has often been seen that we insist on drinking a lot of milk to children but do not pay much attention to other members of the household in terms of milk
 jabaki badhati umr main bhi doodh pinaa utana hi jaruri he jitna bachapan main
 At the same time, people drink milk according to their comfort, like milk is given to children for breakfast, so the elders prefer to drink milk before sleeping at night
 doodh pine kaa sahi samay kya he, is baat ko lekar har kisi ke man main duvidha rahati he
 Many people say that it is good to drink milk with breakfast, then many people consider it right to drink at night
 haalanki agar doodh kaa seven din main kiya jaae to yah hamen dinabhar energy detaa he or raat main liya jaae to yah dimag ko shant karke acchhee neend laane main sahaayak hota he

 What happens when you drink milk at different times
 
 
 subah:pachaane main baari hone ke kaaran subah doodh pine se manaa kiya jaataa he, lekin mana jaataa he ki is samay doodh pine se dinabhar sharir main energy bani rahati he
 Afternoon: Drinking milk in the afternoon is beneficial for the elderly as it gives strength to the body
 shaam:shaam ke samaydoodh pinaa ankhon ke liye bahut acha mana jaataa he
 Night: Drinking milk at night is considered to be the best because it eliminates tiredness of the body throughout the day and makes you sleep well
 ye hai raat ko doodh pine ke laabh- doodh main treeptofan naamak amino acid kii maujuudagi se neend ke hormone str ko badhaane main madad milti he
 For this reason, drinking milk at night leads to good sleep
 - doodh calcium kaa acha strot he, jo haddiyon ko majboot banane main madad karata he
 - Milk contains protein which is beneficial for muscle development
 doodh pine se pehle jaan len kuch jaruri baaten- kamjor pachan, twachaa sambandhi samasyaon, khaansee, apach or pet main keede jaisi samasyaon se pareshaan logon ko doodh ke seven se bachanaa chahie
 - Milk should never be drunk with food as it does not digest quickly
 ise hameshaa alag se garm karke pinaa chahie
 According to Ayurveda, it is necessary to drink milk before night whipping, that you drink it only after two hours of evening meal so that you can get the benefit of drinking milk at night

 spicer ne kaha ki is yatra ke dauraan donon netaaon america-bharat bhagidaari ke liye ek samaan drushti kii ruparekha taiyaar karenge , jisase 1

 When a 1995 batch IAS officer, Ajay Kumar Singh, came in April 2007 as deputy commissioner of Dhanbad, known as the coal capital of the country, he had a lot of challenges
 jharia kol field vishaal gadde jaisaa dikhataa tha
 Like a gunpowder full of fire
 saamaanya halaat main gaanvvaale varshon pehle hi jaan bachaane ke liye apana sabakuch chhodkar kahin chale gaye hote, lekin jindagi chalaane ke liye vahaan rahane ko majaboor the
 For most of the 53,000 families there, collecting coal and selling it in the market was the only source of livelihood
 sarkaar ne kai baar unhen vahaan se kahin or basaane kii koshish kii lekin unhone inkaar kar diya
 All the time would have been spent for some other officer to settle them elsewhere
 ajay singh ke liye bhi yah aasaan nahin tha
 He also noted some other problems for those people
 unhone vruddh pensionbhogiyon kii samasyaon ko gaur se suna
 Generally, many officials ignore them
 computer science main bi
 Ajay, who holds a degree in Tech, was facing complaints of pensioners
 ve jab bhi in gaanvon kaa daura karte to log pension sambandhi shikaayatein lekar unke paas aate or apni pareshaaniyaan bataate the
 Ajay says, "old pensioners are probably the most vulnerable in our society
 zyaadaatar maamalon main unke bachche kahin baahar rah rahe hote hai or ve apane buudhe mata-pita par dhyaan nahin dete hai
 Therefore pensioners have to take care of themselves
 ”ajay ne pension vyavastha kaa jab gaharaai se adhyayan kiya, to ve hairaan rah gaye
 He found that there was no transparency in the delivery of pension, while 376 employees in the district were attached to this department
 pension kii rakam pensionbhogi tak pahunchane se pehle 11 staron or 32 prakriyaaon se guzarati thi
 This entire workout used to take 51 days
 saath hi pension delivery system main paardarshita na hone se bhrashtachar bhi kaaphi tha
 This was almost impossible to monitor, because all records were written by hand
 puri prakriya main bahut der lagati thi
 The biggest problem was with the new pensioner getting the pension sanctioned because there was no information about them
 ajay ne is samasya se nibatane ke liye neshnal informatics centre (enisi) or software visheshgyon kaa sahyog liya taaki koi nayaa system banaaya ja sake
 This was a very difficult task as any change in the government's delivery system needed to be approved at various levels
 lekin ajay ne himmat nahin haari or unhone ek nayaa system taiyaar karne main kamyaabi hasil kar lee
 He named this new system "swavalamban"
 electronic rup se chalane vaale is system main pension kii rakam rajya ke mukhyalay se sidhe sthaneey kosh main aa jaati, jahaan se vah nirdhaarit bainkon main pahunch jaati
 After that the banks would add money to the pensioner's account
 is tarah rajya ke mukhyalay se pensionbhogi tak paisa pahunchane main maatr saat din hi lagate
 In the new system, instead of 11 levels of the pension process, only six levels were left
 isamen paper kaa kahin bhi istemaal nahin hota he
 After the new system was ready, Ajay did a comparative study of both the new and old systems and sent it for government approval
 jaisi ummid thi, sarkaar ne ise manjuur kar liya
 Now it has been implemented all over Jharkhand
 ajay kii koshishon se jharkhand main pensionbhogiyon ko baari raahat mil gai he
 Now they are getting their pension easily from home
 ajay maanate hai ki unhen apni shaikshanik prishthbhumi kii vajah se nai yojanaayen banane main madad milti he
 Ajay, an engineer from iit-delhi, passed the UPSC examination in Physics and Mathematics
 jharkhand ko ajay singh ke kaarykram “swaavlamban” kii vajah se 2013 kaa pratishthit united nesan public sarvice puraskaar mila
 The state government also sent Ajay, the rightful recipient of the award, to collect it

 For both, it was a big challenge to establish its ideology more than to increase the funding sources for the party

 Sometimes with BJP, sometimes against BJP, the residents are from Nalanda district in Bihar
 unhone 2011 main miranda house se english main post grajuation puri kii thi
 She worked for Nitish Kumar in the Bihar elections held last year and was instrumental in increasing the activism of women activists
 isse pehle unhone 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main prashanth kishor kii team ke liye piem narendra modi ke prachaar ke liye kaam kiya
 Shubhrastha worked for the homeless in the severe floods in Jammu and Kashmir in 2014
 shubhrastha kahati hai, 'hamaare or prashanth kishor ke bich kisi tarah kii tulana nahin honi chahie
 Our attitudes and priorities of life are different
