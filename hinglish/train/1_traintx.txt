 unhone hooda par nishaanaa sadhate hue bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke saath 'match fiks' karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Before 2003, the Bandhavgarh Vidhan Sabha seat of Umaria district of Madhya Pradesh was known as Umaria
 magar 2006 main parisemen ke dauraan bandhavgarh vidhansabha seat kaa gathan hua tha
 The seat has been held twice in 2008 and 2013, while by-elections were held in April 2017
 in teenon chunaavon main yahaan par bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) jeet hasil karne main safal rahi he
 Interestingly, before the by-elections for the Bandhavgarh assembly, bjp's Gyan Singh defeated both the Barcongress Pratyashi
 2013 main gyaan singh ne 18 hajaar 6 sau 45 maton se congress ke pyarelal baigaa ko haraaya tha
 Gyan Singh defeated Congress's Savitri Singh Dhurve in the 2008 assembly elections
 magar shadol loksabhaa kshetra se gyaan singh ke nirvaachit hone ke baad yah seat khaali ho gai thi
 In the by-election, Gyan Singh's son Shivnarayan Singh defeated Savitri Singh by 25,476 votes and scored a hat-trick of victory for the BJP
 congress ke puraane garh par bhaajapa kaa kabjaparisemen se pehle yah seat congress kaa garh maani jaati thi, 2006 ke parisemen main kshetra main thodaa bahut badlaav karte hue is vidhansabha kaa naam bandhavgarh kar diya gaya
 Since then Gyan Singh continued to win the 2008 and 2013 elections and his son Shivnarine Singh won the 2017 by-election
 kabhi congress kaa garh rahi bandhavgarh vidhansabha ab bhaajapa ke kabje main he
 Now once the assembly elections are near, both the parties have become active
 congress netaa savitri singh kii adivasee vot bank par tagdi pakad maani jaati he
 He also has the support of local leaders

 The biggest problem in Bandhavgarh is unemployment
 kyonki udyog or rojgaar ke sansadhano kii kami he
 There are coal mines to say, but even if the local people do not get employment in it, then the MNREGA is not being paid
 natijatan log palaayan ke liye majaboor hai

 His eyes were on 14-year-old son Rishabh, who was reminding his six-year-old daughter Meghna of spelling

 The soft-spoken Rana, a chashmadhir who teaches at the Police Training College in Hazaribagh, specializes in neutralizing explosives
 unke rajya jharkhand main bam ko niskriy karnaa routine kaam jaisaa he
 In the last four years, ie between 2008 and 2012, when there was a total of 3,659 deaths (both from security personnel and civilians) due to Naxalite violence in the landmine blast in the country, one-fourth of these happened in Jharkhand alone
 haalanki yah rajya duusare number par he kyonki naksali hinsa se buree tarah grast chhattisgarh main 1,244 mautein hui hai
 But in Chhattisgarh, where the graph of death goes upwards, in Jharkhand its face is downwards
 2008 main 207 mautein hui thim jabaki 2012 main yah sankhya 162 par aa gai
 Much of the credit for this goes to this bomb disposal squad which has disabled more than 2,000 landmines in this period

 Pradhan wanted Rana to reach Ranchi with the team early as he suspected a powerful Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in the stomach of CRPF jawan Babulal Patel
 pradhan ne jab rana ko yah jimmedaari saunpi to unhone jawan ke sharir kii pavitrataa kaa sirf zikr kiya lekin unka sandesh spasht tha ki shahid ke parivaar ke liye shav ko bachaa lenaa
 Patel, 29, was among the 10 jawans who were gunned down by the Naxalites on January 7 within the jungles of Katia in Latehar
 patel hafte bhar pehle hi chhuttiyon se laute the
 Police found their bodies on 9 January
 lekin teen gramin us samay apni jaan se haath dho baithe jab ek duusare shav main lagi iidi fat gai
 As soon as adg's phone rang, Rana hurriedly sipped tea and called three other members of his team — 43-year-old Sub Inspector Vijay Ranjan, 42-year-old constable Ashraf Qureshi and 35-year-old Abdul Karim
 unhone bas itnaa kaha, “rachi ke liye taiyaar ho jaao
 "in half an hour the team had left for Ranchi, 100 km from Hazaribagh
 ek raat pehle ranchi ke rajendra institute of medical sciensej (rems) main jab doctor shahid hue sipaahiyon kii laash kaa muyna kar rahe the to ve patel ke pet par taaje taanke dekhakar chaunke the
 The stitches did not have any swelling i

 these stitches were placed after death
 shavon ko khule maidan main ret ke boron ke bich rakhaa gaya
 Rana did a thorough inspection but it was difficult to guess what the explosive they were going to deal with and their escape scope
 jaahir he, naksaliyon ko sharir kaa vah hissaa katkar ang nikaalkar usamen bam plant karne main kaaphi vakt laga hoga
 Rana's team was surprised at this barbarity
 ek pal ke liye rana ke dimag main is shahid jawan kii vidhwaa kaa khyaal aayaa or unka dhyaan apni patni savita kii ore chalaa gaya, jo bacchon samet unka kitna khyal rakhti hai
 Then felt how much the family would need him
 lekin jald hi unhone yah khyal dimag se nikaal diya
 This was not the time to get emotional
 team ke sadasyon ne ek-duusare se haath milaayaa, phir dharti ko chuaa taaki aise samay hone vaali sharir kii kanpakanpi shant ho sake
 The bomb experts confirmed that there is a big thing inside the corpse
 sabase aasaan tarika tha ki niyantrit visphot karvaa diya jaataa, lekin mritak ke sharir ko uske parivaar ke liye bachaane kii jimmedaari bhi thi
 For this, Rana had to go close to the corpse and place an X-ray scanner on it and see it on a laptop with a wire attached to it
 rana ne tay kiya ki ve bam nirodhi suut pahane bagaiyr shav tak jaaenge
 They knew that a 30 kg bomb suit could cause problems in dealing with pressure-sensitive bombs
 aisa pehali baar nahin tha ki rana apane kaam se jude do anivaary niyamon kii andekhi kar rahe the
 Every bomb detector is told that he "does not have to be martyred" and "never gets a second chance
" ” rana bhi jaanate the ki kaise in niyamon kii andekhi karne se kai bam visheshgy apni jaan se haath dho chuke hai

 In October 2012, Rajesh Kumar, a 42-year-old sub-inspector of the Special Task Force, had to go a kilometer in Palamu with an IED of 15 kg in his hand as it was found in a congested area where it was not possible to deactivate it
 ve kehete hai, “mujhe aisa isliye karnaa padaa kyonki bam ko logon kii bheed se dur le ja ke nasht karnaa tha
 At that time, Rajesh Kumar did not wear a bomb disposal suit as the 30 kg suit was stopping his pace
 10 janvari ko rana ke saamne bhi aisa hi khatra tha
 He placed the X-ray scanner very cleanly on the corpse
 real time vuing system ke sahare unhone jo dekha, usne unki ashanka ko pusht kar diya
 The IED was placed in an iron box that was attached to the batteries and also had a pressure release device and detonator
 team ne 10 minute tak charchaa kii, phir tay hua ki cordex water charge kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 It is a method of neutralizing bombs in which a light-bearing detonating cord filled with pentaerythritol tetranitrate is detonated in a controlled way close to the target, causing a large amount of water splash and the detonator cord to get wet
 phir sidhe lakshya kii ore pani kii bauchhaar chodi jaati he jo circuit ko kaat kar bam ko niskriy kar detii he
 The need here was that the water shower should be so fast that it would first cut the stitches and then deactivate the wires
 chota visphot mumkin tha, donon ko kaatane ke baraabar pani kii gati paidaa na kar paata jabaki bade visphot se bam fat bhi saktaa tha
 For Rana, it was like walking on a double-edged sword
 pani kii bottlen or kuch halke visphotak laash ke upar rakhe gaye or pani kii dhar uske paas lagaai gai
 All four people turned away
 achaanak halkaa visphot hua or jaisaa hona chahie tha, vahi hua
 The jet of water cut the stitches and deactivated the circuit
 iske baad kore bam ko haath se nikaala gaya or ek surakshit jagah par usamen visphot kar diya gaya
 The danger was averted
 rana ne phone chaalu kiya, patni ko lagaaya or bole, “are yah to rojaanaa vaala kaam tha
 “the bomb disposal squad of Jharkhand has to go through a new challenge every day

 You will know the exact post-wedding experience only when you get married
 lekin kai aisi chijen hai jisase har ladki ko guzarana padataa he
 Based on the experience of many married girls, we are going to tell you some similar things
 inke bare main agar aapako shaadi se pehle pataa hoga to acha rahegaa
 1- You are sure to have evil behind your back
 sasuraal jane ke baad kai paimaanon par aapako parkhaa jaataa he
 Not everyone likes your style
 aise main peeth peeche kii baton ko peeche hi rahane dengi to acha hoga
 2- If the family is big, then you should be ready for family politics
 darane or ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 Gradually you will understand the politics of everyone
 3- aap apane pati se pyaar karti hai or aapke pati aapse pyaar karte hai lekin unke ghar vaale bhi unase prem karte hai aise main kai baar takaraav or manmutav kii sthiti ban jaati he
 In domestic matters, it is not necessary that your husband always supports you
 iske liye bhi ladakiyon ko maansik rup se taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 4- Personal life interferes with moving to a new home
 ab aapako duusare kii marji kaa bhi khyaal rakhana hota he
 If there are more members in the family then it is more difficult to get personal space
 shaadi ke shuruaati dinon main aati hai ye dikkatein!5- pehle aap paison kaa khyaal khud hi rakhti thim or apane hisaab se yuj karti thim
 But after marriage, the matter of money is not limited to you only
 6- privet spes to bhul jaaie ab aapkaa kuch bhi privet nahin rah jaataa he kam se kam aapke pati ko to sari baaten pataa hi hoti hai
 It is also cute but can also cause annoyance at times

 Swami Prasad Maurya, who had made a serious political accusation against Mayawati just before the assembly elections in UP, reached Delhi on Friday
 apane liye raajnneetik vikalp talashne main jute maury yahaan bijepi netaaon se mulaakaat karne vaale hai, vahiin bispi chhodane ke baad unki 'cycle kii sawari' yani sapa main shaamil hone kii charchaa ne jor pakadi he
 So far, the market of speculation was hot on this question and the discussion was that Maurya will not only hold the Samajwadi Party, but can also get a ministerial berth in Akhilesh Yadav's cabinet reshuffle on June 27
 swami prasad maury kebahujan samaaj partichhodane ke baad jis tarah akhilesh yadav shivpal yadav se lekar ajam khan ne unki tarif kii, usase in atakalon ko or bhi dam mila
 Akhilesh even said for Maurya that he is a good person but in the wrong party
 duusari ore, bispi ke pramukh obisi chehre ke baahar hone ke baad mayawati kii puri koshish party ke vot ko chhitakane se rokna he
 Maya has also called a meeting of party legislators in this regard
 sapa par maury ne saadhaa nishanasvami prasad morya ne guuruuvaar ko jis tarah se samaajawaadee party ke khilaaf bayaanbaji kii, usase yah tay ho gaya ki vah cycle kii sawari karne se pehle har tarah ke vikalp ko tatolna chaahate hai
 In a direct attack on the Samajwadi Party, Swami Prasad Maurya said that it is the responsibility of the Samajwadi Party leaders to stop the chaos and hooliganism going on in Uttar Pradesh for the last 4 years
 maurya ne yahaan tak kaha ki chaahe samaajawaadee party ho yaa bhartiya janata party apane logon par lagaam lagaana or party main kya chal rahaa he, ise dekhnaa netaaon kii jimmedaari he
 This statement of Maurya left the SP leaders stunned
 party ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha ki aisi bayaanbaji karke maury apane liye sapa main aane ke raste band kar rahe hai
 Now there is no possibility that Swami Prasad Maurya will join the party and become a minister in the cabinet reshuffle to be held on 27th
 sapa ke liye hoga phaayde kaa saudahalanki, samaajawaadee party ke netaa yah maanate hai kimaury agar unki party seakar judate to voton ke ganit ke hisaab se yah acha sauda hota
 Before the elections, the SP is engaged in an effort to get more and more backward castes to be associated with the party
 ise sapa ke khilaaf lagane vaale is aarope kii dhar kam hogi ki vah sirf yadavon kii party he
 It is said that in this endeavor, the friendship between Beni Prasad Verma and Ajit Singh was forgotten, and the hand of friendship was extended
 samaajawaadee party ke netaaon ko ummid he ki benny prasad verma apane saath kurmi vot or ajit singh apane saath jat vot kii saugat laaenge
 Swami Prasad may be the leader of work for Maurya SP, because the Samajwadi Party does not have a big face for the Kushwaha fraternity from which the Mauryas come
 sapa main maury ko lekar rukhe tevar bhispa ke netaa yah bhi dekh rahe hai ki pichhadi jatiyon ko jodne ke liye kis tarah se bijepi apni ranneeti taiyaar kar rahi he
 He has made his intention clear by giving bjp's reins in Uttar Pradesh to Keshav Prasad Maurya
 lekin sapa ke varisht mantri kaa kahana he ki itane bhi bade netaa nahin he ki unhen party main laane ke liye araju minnat kii jaae
 Everyone knows that he lost his assembly election and later won the by-election
 shakti pradarshan ke baad bijepi tay karegi raidusari ore,swami prasad mauryabijepi netaaon ke bhi sampark main hai or dilli jaakar bijepi ke netaaon se mil bhi sakate hai
 On July 1, Maurya has called a meeting of his supporters in Lucknow
 ise unka shakti pradarshan bhi mana ja rahaa he
 If the support is good, then Swami Prasad Maurya can also form his own party so that his position is strong and he can join the BJP or SP later
 maury ko lagata he ki jaldbaaji main kadam uthaane se vah thik se mol tol nahin kar paaenge
 Samajwadi Party is currently not in the mood to go ahead and talk to them
 ab sab kuch is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki unhen kitna samarthan miltaa he or bijepi se unki baatcheet main unhen kitni tarjeeh di jaati he
 Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani has said that he will hold talks with his allies and opposition on this issue, with the possibility of general elections in Pakistan to be held soon

 Although general elections are scheduled in the country in March 2013, several opposition parties, including the main opposition parties PML-A and Jamiat ulema-e-islam, have called for early elections to revive the nation facing problems
 sattarudh pakistan pipuls party ke netaaon ne haal hi main kaha tha ki aam chunaav aktubar yaa november main ho sakate hai
 Gilani said that after the passage of the fifth budget, the election year will begin and we are of the view that elections may be held soon after the elections

 ham swatantra, nishpaksh or paardarshee chunaav chaahate hai
 He said that the general budget will be presented in May and mps will get a lot of time to debate the issues

 He asked LJP to contest the assembly elections but his request was not entertained
 lekin paswan ne apni party ke liye prachaar karne ko kaha
 Paswan used to introduce him in election rallies, 'osama bin Laden
 'iske baad nur sitambar 2005 main rajd kii taraf mukhaatib hue or lalu prasad ke liye prachaar kiya
 At that time, Noor was in such a demand that the senior leader was taken off and placed in a helicopter

 Getting Atal Bihari Vajpayee in the boss position is difficult and yet easy
 pehali baat to mujhe yah samajni padi—or aisa karne main mujhe vaaki bahut lanbaa vakt laga—ki unhen unki simaaon ke saath sweekaar karnaa hoga
 After some time i realized that he had some illusions, as well as he was full of tremendous confidence
 shuruyaat main yah aasaan kaam nahin tha, kyonki ve apni khamoshi main khaase magan the or main yah sochataa rah jaataa tha ki mujhase kya karne kii ummid kii ja rahi thi
 This became very difficult in June 1996, when he became the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 unase jude mujhe mushkil se do hafte hi hue the
 i was pushed into an unknown area
 aisa isse pehle kabhi nahin hua tha ki ek iees afasar vipaksh ke netaa ke sachiv kaa kaam kar rahaa ho
 There was a small office and while working from home, he, i and a third lower employee were there who listened to the phone
 dhire-dhire chijen dharre par aa gayi
 i used to read a few hundred letters coming to him, which i thought worthy of answering, prepared his answers and sent the rest to the concerned government officials
 behad jaruri chitthiyon ke jawaab ve khud haath se likhte or kai baar main jo jawaab taiyaar karata tha unheen par likh dete the
 He was called as the chief guest at some event, so i had to write his speeches as well
 mujhe ek khaas aayojan kii yaad he jo centre for science or envyranment main tha; unhone mere saare masaude naamanzoor kar die, aakhir main mujhase kaha ki main niabandh likh rahaa tha, bhaashan nahin
 He made many changes and the speech became very good
 yah mere liye ek sabak tha
 Gradually i realized that behind the quiet and often sleepy gesture, there is a constantly hard-thinking mind of this vigilante man who cannot be easily satisfied on important issues
 videsh mantralay kaa taiyaar kiya hua 200 pannon kaa desh kaa sankshipt byoraa mahaj ek shaam bhar main aatmsaat kar liya jaataa tha
 This made it difficult for me to live because it meant that i had to study as well
 ve "bade chitra'' ko dimag main rakhane vaale shaks the, par aise shaks bhi the jo asambaddha najar aa rahi baton ke bich kii kadigoon ko pakad sakate the
 Even the smallest thing could not escape his eyes
 yah tab or saaf hota jab ve tivi ke liye bhaashan record karavaate the
 They were willing to repeat the recording several times, until there was not a single flaw left in it
 is anant dhairya kaa matlab yah nahin tha ki mauka bhaanpakar ve bahut teji se kadam nahin uthaate the
 a visit to Lahore that changed the way the world looked at India, armed with nuclear power, would not have happened if they had not caught an interview of Nawaz Sharif in which he said that Mr
 Vajpayee in Lahore They will be very happy to host
 videsh mantralay ne to aupchaarik nyauta milane ke baad hi pratikriya dene kaa suzav diya tha, par iske ulat vaajapeyi ne kaha ki unhen lahore jaakar khushi hogi
 Although the outcome of this visit was the battle of Kargil, but the objective was achieved that India's relationship with Pakistan would be on its own terms
 duusare maukon par alabatta ve tamaam pakshon ko puri tarah sunne ke liye taiyaar rahete the
 What i remember about him as a boss was a daily breakfast conversation, in which Brajesh Mishra and Ashok Saikia were always there
 har koi akhbaar padhata, ahm baton kii charchaa hoti, dridhtaa magar vinamrata se nittaphakiyaan jaahir kii jaatin, din kaa agenda tay kiya jaataa, or sabhi ko shaam ko lautakar report deni hoti
 It was all a matter-of-fact and democratic, but he would have taken the final decision
 unhen apana adhikaar jataane kii jarurat nahin padati, par ve adhikaar jataa nahin sakate yah maan lenaa bhi galati thi
 The writer had been Vajpayee's personal secretary for three and a half years *** agar aap apane pension clem kaa final setlement karnaa chaahate hai to aapke liye aadhaar number dikhaanaa anivaary hoga
 The Ministry of Labor has issued an explanation this time on Thursday
 tippaniyan You have said in the clarification by the Labor Ministry, 'EPFO has decided that Aadhaar is mandatory for final settlement of pension but it will not be necessary to show Aadhaar currently in cases of withdrawal under' Employment Pension Scheme 1995 '
 mantralay ke mutabik ipiefo ne 'employament pension skim 1995' se jude sabhi sadasyon se 31 march 2017 tak apana aadhaar number jamaa karne ko kaha he
 The ministry has denied the media reports that it was not mandatory to show Aadhaar number during the final settlement of pension claims
 shram mantralay ne aapane spashtikaran main kaha he, 'EPFO ne yah tay kiya he ki pension kii final setlement ke liye aadhaar anivaary he lekin 'employament pension skim 1995' ke tahat vidadroll ke maamalon main philhal aadhaar dikhaanaa jaruri nahin hoga'
 According to the ministry, the EPFO has asked all the members associated with the 'employment Pension Scheme 1995' to submit their Aadhaar numbers by 31 March 2017
 mantralay ne media main chhapi un khabaron kaa khandan kiya he jisamen ye daawa kiya gaya tha ki pension clems ke final setlement ke dauraan aadhaar number dikhaanaa anivaary nahin he

 In Hinduism, there are many love stories of shiva-parvati, vishnu-lakshmi, rama-sita, radha-krishna
 par ek katha aisi he, jise aapane shaayad hi suna ho
 This is the story of Lord Ganesha and Tulsi
 vighnon ke naashak maane jane vaale ganesh ji ne kabhi tulsi ke prem ko asweekaar kar diya tha or naaraaz hokar use shraap bhi diya tha
 The story is like this
 ek dintulsinadi kinare gum rahi thim
 There he saw a person absorbed in penance
 vah bhagwaan ganesh the
 Due to austerity, a sharp ooz was on his face, which attracted Tulsi to him
 tulsi ne diya tha vivaah prastaavve unke paas gayi or unke saamne vivaah kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Parganesh ji rejected his love proposal with great decency
 unhone kaha ki ve us kanya se vivaah karenge, jiske gun unki maa parvati jaise hon
 Tulsi got angry on hearing this
 unhone ise apana apmaan samajha or ganesh ji ko shraap diya ki unka vivaah unki ichha ke vipareet hoga
 They will never get a life partner like Maa Parvati
 karachi main dhoomdhaam se manaaya gaya ganesh utsavaise hua tha bhagwaan krishna kii priya kaa janm
 
 
 Ganesh ji also got angry after hearing this curse of Ganesha
 unhone bhi tulsi ko shraap diya ki unka vivaah ek asur ke saath hoga
 After this, Basil realized his mistake
 unhone ganesh ji se maafee maangi
 Ganesh ji forgiving him said that she will become a venerable plant
 par unki puja main tulsi kaa kabhi prayog nahin kiya jayega
 Tulsi was later married to an asura named Shankhachud, also known as Jalandhar

 Between India and Pakistan, there is a war-like situation, amid this tension, US President Donald Trump has made a big statement

 "let us tell you that after the terrorist attack in Pulwama on 14 February, America condemned it and advised Pakistan to take strong action against the terrorists

 It is said that leaders want to stick to the chair even in dreams

 But for the leaders of the BJP, the chair of the president of Delhi is proving to be the suicide chair

 Satish Upadhyay Working Period: From July 2014 till now, the latest example of Southeastern politics is the current President of Delhi BJP Satish Upadhyay
 mukhyamantri kii kursi to bahut hi dur kaudi he unhen to is vidhansabha chunaav main apane liye tikat tak nahin mil paaya
 It is said that Upadhyay wanted assembly ticket from Mehrauli
 is baat ko lekar unke samarthakon ne khub hangaamaa bhi kiya, lekin sab beasar sabit hua
 Satish Upadhyay is currently Malviya Nagar of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (ward no

 Harshvardhan was projected as the leader
 harshavardhan bijepi ko bahumat to nahin dilaa paae lekin uske khate main sabase zyada siten ain
 He was made Health Minister as soon as BJP government was formed at the Center and in a reshuffle a few days later, he was shifted to another ministry

 Even Harshavardhan dreams could not be fulfilled that the parachute entry of former IPS officer Kiran Bedi was done

 Vijendra Gupta: Time: May 15, 2010 to February 15, 2013 Vijender Gupta has always been the voice of BJP against Sheila Dixit government in Delhi
 gupta ke netritv main hi bijepi ne saal 2012 main dilli ke teenon nagar nigamon 3-0 se jeet dilaai
 Gupta, who was on the front against Sheila Dixit, was also fielded against him in the assembly elections and he could not reach the Vidhan Sabha
 2009 main gupta chandani chowk lok sabha se chunaav bhi lade
 And after losing the election, there are very few leaders whom the party gives big awards
 kam se kam gupta kii kismat ko itani buland kabhi nahin rahi
 It seems as if the leader cannot become the chief ministerial candidate after becoming Delhi president
 use qurbaani deni hi hoti he
 Perhaps this is the reality of the 'one man one post' policy in Delhi BJP

 jharkhand or jammu-kashmir vidhansabha chunaav ke parinaam aa gaye hai
 In Jharkhand, the BJP has come to power more or less, but not in the manner that is called an absolute majority
 jammu-kashmir main party ne jabardast ladaai ladi or jammu kshetra main apni dhak jamaa gai, lekin ghati main use ek bhi seat nahin mili
 Whereas during the election campaign, it seemed that the party would wave its glory in the valley this time too
 lekin tamaam shorsharabe ke baad bhi party ko bahumat to dur pehla sthaan bhi nahin mila
 All the seats in the valley went to other parties
 mufti said kii party pidipi ne is baar shandaar pradarshan kiya, lekin vah bhi bahumat se dur rahi
 However, PDP is in a position to form the government due to being the largest party
 haalanki ab yah us par nirbhar he ki vah kisase madad lekar sarkaar banaati he
 With the attitude and attitude of the BJP, it is not likely that it will form the government with the PDP
 phir bhi raajnneeti main kuch bhi pakke taur par nahin kaha ja saktaa
 However, now is the time to review whether PM Modi's magic spell or not
 agar ham dhyaan se dekhen tojharkhandamen party ne loksabhaa chunaav main jitna acha pradarshan kiya vah use vidhansabha main ripet nahin kar pai
 At that time, the party surprised everyone by winning 12 out of 14 seats
 lekin is baar jeemem ne use kaaphi had tak roka
 Similarly, out of the 6 seats in Jammu and Kashmir, BJP won half or 3 seats and PDP also won 3
 lekin ab yahaan bijepi kaa vah prabhaav nahin dikhaa
 Why this decline occurred is a matter of research
 kya janata bijepi ke ab tak ke parformens se khush nahin he yaa koi or kaaran he?agar modi kii sabhaaon main bheed ko dekhen to lagegaa ki unka magic barkaraar he, lekin rigelt aisa nahin kehete
 The number of minorities in these two states is considerable
 jharkhand main bhi kai siten aisi hai jahaan isaayiyon kii aabaadi acchhee-khaasi he
 The way the RSS and other Hinduist organizations were talking about conversion and campaigning for some time, the people there were disillusioned with the BJP
 vah piem modi ke vikaas ke naare se prabhavit to hai, lekin aresas jaise sanghathanon se ghabaraae hue bhi hai
 The same is true of Jammu and Kashmir where Muslim population is more
 in donon rajyon main dharmantaran jaise maamle votaron ko bijepi se dur karte rahe
 The so-called Hindutva frightens them and they look for alternatives
 yahi kaaran he ki jharkhand main jeemem par bhrashtachar ke tamaam aaropon ke baavjood party ne apni sthiti bigadane nahin di
 This conclusion may be a matter of debate, but it is certain that the voters did not think as close to the BJP as the party had hoped
 piem modi kii lokapriyata main koi kami nahin dikhi to phir koi na koi kaaran to iske peeche jarur rahaa he

 Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt, who has been sentenced to five years imprisonment after being convicted in a case related to the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts, has clarified that he neither ever appealed to the Maharashtra governor nor did he ever apologize
 Requested someone to do it on their behalf
 sanjay dutt ke vakeelon hitesh jain or subhash jadhav ne shuukravaar ko jari ek bayaan main kaha ki haalia lekhon main yah kaha gaya he ki maharashtra ke rajyapal ne abhinayta ko maafee die jane kii unki apil thukraa di he
 He said the article was based on a request by retired Supreme Court Judge Markandey Katju, in which he appealed for amnesty for Dutt and other convicts of the case
 bayaan main kaha gaya he, sanjay dutt yaa unke parivaar ke sadasyon ne maafee maange jane ke sambandh main rajyapal ko koi yachika nahin di
 Apart from this, Sanjay Dutt or his family never approached Katju, a former Supreme Court judge, to file an application for forgiveness on behalf of Dutt
 unhone kaha, nyaayamurti katju ne keval dutt hi nahin, balki jabunnisa kaaji samet maamle ke anya doshiyon ke liye bhi swayan yah nivedan kiya he
 The statement said that Sanjay Dutt has almost completed his sentence and he should be released soon
 katju ne maharashtra ke rajyapal si vidyasagar raav ko sanjay dutt kii shesh sajaa radd karne ke sambandh main yachika di thi
 He had said that Sanjay is not a terrorist, he only made a mistake
 raav ne maharashtra ke grih vibhaag kii salaah ke baad maafee kii yachika do din pehle khaarij kar di thi
 The department in its recommendation had said that waiving the sentence of Sanjay Dutt would set a wrong example
 56-varshiya sanjay dutt ko tada kii ek vishesh adaalat ne hathiyaar rakhane ke maamle main shastr kanoon ke tahat 2007 main doshi tehraaya tha or unhen paanch varsh kade karawas kii sajaa sunai thi
 After his arrest in 1996, Dutt spent 18 months in jail
 supreme court dwaara may, 2013 main doshasiddhi or sajaa ko barkaraar rakhe jane ke baad abhinayta ne aatmasamarpan kar diya tha
 He has since been lodged in Yerwada Jail in Pune
 sanjay may 2013 main pune kii yarvada jail bheje jane ke baad do baar perol par or do baar farlo par jail se baahar aa chuke hai
 Sanjay came out of jail on furlough for 14 days in October 2013 and then this period was extended for a fortnight
 janvari 2014 main sanjay kii 30 din kii perol bhi anya 30 dinon ke liye badha di gai thi
 In December 2014, he was given a 14-day furlough
 27 agast 2015 se vah ek baar phir farlo par hai
 Sanjay has spent nearly 30 months behind bars
 farvari 2016 main sajaa puri hone ke baad vah reeha kiye jaaenge
 The comments yachika main katju ne kaha tha, ‘‘jis ekmaatr aarope ke liye sanjay ko doshi tehraaya gaya he vah aarope he ki unhone ek pratibandhit hathiyaar apane paas rakhaa tha
 He also emphasized that he is not questioning the Supreme Court verdict
 katju ne likhaa ki hathiyaar rakhane ke liye paanch saal kii sajaa sahi he lekin sanjay ne sajaa sunaae jane se pehle, march 2013 main 18 maah salaakhon ke peeche bitaa kar paryaapt dand bhugta he isliye yah maamla maafee ke anukool he
 In a statement released on Friday, Sanjay Dutt's lawyers Hitesh Jain and Subhash Jadhav said that recent articles stated that the Maharashtra governor had turned down his plea for amnesty to the actor
 unhone kaha ki yah lekh supreme court ke sevanivrutt nyaayadhish markandeya katju ke ek nivedan par aadhaarit hai, jisamen unhone dutt or maamle ke anya doshiyon ke liye maafee kii apil kii he
 The statement said, Sanjay Dutt or his family members did not give any petition to the governor regarding the apology
 iske alaava sanjay dutt yaa unke parijan ne dutt kii ore se maafee ke vaaste aavedan dene ke liye supreme court ke purv nyaayadhish katju se kabhi sampark nahin kiya
 He said, Justice Katju has made this request not only to Dutt, but also to the other convicts of the case including Jabunnisa Kazi
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki sanjay dutt ne apni sajaa lagbhag puri kar lee he or unhen jald hi reeha kar diya janaa chahie
 Katju had petitioned Maharashtra Governor c Vidyasagar Rao to cancel the remaining sentence of Sanjay Dutt
 unhone kaha tha ki sanjay aatankwaadi nahin hai, unhone keval galati kii thi
 Rao's plea for amnesty was rejected two days ago following the advice of Maharashtra Home Department
 vibhaag ne apni sifarish main kaha tha ki sanjay dutt kii sajaa maaf karne se ek galat udhaaharan pesh hoga
 Sanjay Dutt, 56, was convicted in 2007 by a special TADA court under the Arms Act on weapons possession and sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment
 dutt ne 1996 main apni giraftaar ke baad 18 maheene jail main kaate the
 The actor surrendered after the Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentence in May 2013
 uske baad se vah pune kii yarvada jail main band hai
 After being sent to Yerwada Jail in Pune in May 2013, Sanjay has come out of jail twice on parole and twice on furlough
 sanjay aktubar 2013 main 14 din ke liye farlo par jail se baahar aae or phir yah avadhi ek pakhwaade ke liye badha di gai
 In January 2014, Sanjay's 30-day payroll was also extended for another 30 days
 disambar 2014 main unhen 14 din kii farlo di gai thi
 Since 27 August 2015, he is once again on furlough
 sanjay kareeb 30 maah salaakhon ke peeche bitaa chuke hai
 He will be released after completion of his sentence in February 2016
 tippaniyan In the petition, Katju had said, "the only charge for which Sanjay has been convicted is the charge that he kept a prohibited weapon
" ’’ unhone is baat par bhi jor diya ki vah ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle par sawaal nahin uthaa rahe hai
 Katju wrote that the five-year sentence for possessing weapons is correct, but Sanjay, after sentencing, spent 18 months behind bars in March 2013 and paid a substantial penalty, so the case was amnesty
 bayaan main kaha gaya he, sanjay dutt yaa unke parivaar ke sadasyon ne maafee maange jane ke sambandh main rajyapal ko koi yachika nahin di
 Apart from this, Sanjay Dutt or his family never approached Katju, a former Supreme Court judge, to file an application for forgiveness on behalf of Dutt

 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki congress rojgaar ko lekar pareshaan nahin he balki uske shashan main bichauliyon kii balle balle thi lekin aadhaar lagu karne se bichauliyon kaa rojgaar chhin gaya isliye congress dukhi he
 The Prime Minister also mentioned the NPA and said that it was a result of the policies of the Congress and our government took steps to end it
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki enpie par congress ke paap ko jaanate hue bhi main chup tha lekin desh sab jaanata he
 He said that the country should know that behind this is the business of the old government
 vahi iske liye 100 fisad jimmedaar he
 The PM claimed that the Congress government framed banking policies in which loans were given to the favorites by putting pressure on banks
 bank, sarkaar or bichauliyo kii gathjod se desh lutaa ja rahaa tha
 Billions and trillions were given from banks
 sarkaar main agar mujhe raajnneeti kerani hoti to pehle hi din desh ke saamne wo saare tathy rakh detaa, lekin us samay main aisi baat karne se arthvyavastha dagamagaa jaati
 Therefore, knowing your (congress) sins, i kept myself silent for the good of the country and kept facing the charge
 ye enpie aapkaa paap tha
 After coming to our government, not a single loan was given in which the NPA was covered
 piem modi ne congress dwaara die gaye enpie ke aankadon ko bhi galat qaraar diya
 The PM said, 'you said that the NPA is 36%, but when we started scrubbing the papers, 82% NPA came out
 'piem ne sadan ko bataaya ki congress ke samay 52 lakh karod rupee kaa NPA tha
 The Congress is responsible for the NPA and the figure that is rising today is the interest on your sin
 desh aapako is paap ke liye maaf nahin karegaa

 chhattisgarh ke naksal prabhavit ilaakon main police ko naksaliyon ke saath-saath dooshit pani or machharon ke kaaran hone vaali bimariyon se bhi ladanaa pad rahaa he
 In view of this problem of police personnel, now RO systems and fogging machines are being arranged in police stations of Bijapur district
 bijapur jile ke police adheekshak mohit garg ne shanivaar ko bataaya ki jile ke dhur naksal prabhavit ilaakon main tainaat police javaanon ko aksar dooshit pani or gandagi se hone vaali bimariyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 In view of this situation of jawans, RO machines for clean water and smoke machines have been arranged at 16 places in all police stations and camps of the district
 garg ne bataaya ki jile main tainaat police javaanon ke liye rosemara kii jaruraton or peyajal kii vyavastha kii gai he
 They had to rely on local and traditional methods to clean drinking water
 yah sthiti us samay or bhi kharaab ho jaati thi jab jawan naksal rodhi abhiyaan ke liye nikalate the
 In such a situation, the police jawans used to drink the water of river drain and used to fall ill
 ise dekhte hue police prashasan ne thanon or shiviron main aaro pranali lagane kaa faisla kiya he
 Police officer said that shortly before, installation of RO system has been completed in all 21 police stations of the district and 24 camps of Chhattisgarh Armed Forces
 bijapur jila bastar kshetra kaa aisa ekmaatr jila he jahaan ke sabhi thanon main saaf pani ke liye aaro system lagaaya gaya he
 So far these facilities were available only in the camps of the central forces
 police adheekshak ne bataaya ki bastar kshetra main dooshit pani se pilia, typhoid or charm rog tathaa machharon se hone vaali malaria or dengue jaisi bimaariyaan aam hai
 Many police personnel stationed in the area lost their lives due to illnesses
 unhone bataaya ki keval bijapur jile main hi is varsh oktober maah tak police ke 60 jawan dooshit pani ke kaaran biimaar hue the or 250 javaanon ko malaria or dengue hua tha
 Three of them died during treatment
 garg ne bataaya ki kshetra main in samasyaon ko dekhte hue police javaanon ko machharadaani or kitnashak maraham uplabdh karaayaa gaya he
 But this arrangement proves to be inadequate when the jawans come out in anti-naxalite a Bhiyan under adverse conditions in the forest and stay out of the camp for several days
 vahiin, thanon or shiviron main bhi machharon kaa aatank he
 Due to this, more than 20 percent of the young people become victims of deadly diseases like malaria and dengue
 garg ne bataaya ki is kshetra main tainaat hone ke dauraan vah swayan bhi malaria or dengue kaa teen baar saamana kar chuke hai
 He said that after realizing these problems, he along with the Chief Executive Officer of the District Panchayat, Abhishek Kumar Singh, started an effort to install RO systems in police stations and camps and to remove mosquitoes from smoke machines

 rajdhani dilli main minimum veg ko lekar ek baar phir bijepi or aam aadmi party aamane saamne hai
 BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri has said that the Delhi government has raided her school because she wants to defame the defamation case against her minister and mlas
 pichley dinon aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne dilli kii tamaam companiyon, skulon or aspataalon main minimum veg kii jaanch ko lekar chhapemari karai thi
 Later, the Aam Aadmi Party held a press conference and released documents in the media against several former BJP mps and MP from South Delhi, Ramesh Bidhudike School
 aam aadmi party kaa kahana tha ki bijepi saansad bidhudi apane skulon main garib mazdooron se kaam karvaa kar nunatam mazdooree bhi nahin de rahe hai
 BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri retaliated on the matter, saying that the government is constantly pressurizing the minister and legislators to get the defamation case cleared
 yahi vajah he ki sangam vihaar main unke skool main farji red karai gai
 Bidhuri also alleged that an attempt was made by the authorities to spread lies that the poor laborers were being forced to work and not even the minimum wage
 bidhudi ne kaha ki child act kaa hawala dekar unke skool main jis tareeke se red karai gai he, vah puri tarah se galat he
 Also, children of poor sections are given free education in their school, but Kejriwal government is targeting them with wrong motives

 There can be no comparison with Pakistan on the ground of internal democracy and global responsibility
 bharat main prajatantr vaastavik or sampurna rup se sthapit he, vahiin pakistan kii jamhuriyat dikhaava maatr he
 Apart from this, he has been identified as a terrorist country, where terrorist organizations get open shelter
 vishwa main chalane vaali praaia: sabhi aatanki gatividhiyon ke taar kisi na kisi rup main pakistan se jude rahete hai
 This reality of Pakistan was exposed once again
 koi jimmedaar mulk hota to apane nirvaachit pradhanmantri dwaara kiye gaye achche vaade ke anuroop aage badhata
 Just a few days ago in Ufa, Nawaz Sharif promised his Indian counterpart that Pakistan would maintain a ceasefire along the border
 iske maddenjar donon deshon ke rashtriya suraksha salahakaaron kii vaarta hogi
 In fact, it was proposed by Narendra Modi
 yah prastaav bharat kii paramparaagat niti ke anuroop tha
 Modi had called the rulers of SAARC countries on the occasion of his swearing-in
 iskaa sandesh saaf tha
 Modi wanted to tell that India wants peace and amicable relations with all its neighbors
 us samay bhi sharif ne modi ke prayaason kii saraahna kii thi, apni taraf se sahyog kaa vaada kiya tha
 But Nawaz Sharif could not keep his promise after returning to Pakistan
 sena ne unhen bharat ke saath sambandh saamaanya banane se roak diya
 This is the biggest problem with Pakistan
 duusare deshon ke saath mukhya vaarta satta main baithe logon ke bich hoti he
 The army does not make this decision
 na kisi desh kaa pradhanmantri yaa raashtrapati pakistani sena pramukh se dwipaksheeya vaarta karata he
 The talks are with the Pakistani Prime Minister
 usee aadhaar par tay hota he ki sambandhon ko saamaanya banane kii disha main kya kiya jayega
 But Pakistan's reality undermines all efforts
 is samasya se keval bharat hi pareshaan nahin he
 It was a coincidence that Nawaz Sharif's visit to the US was being made in October at the time when Pakistan was showing its color in view of the National Security Advisor level talks
 is par america ke hi kai jimmedaar varisht adhikariyon kaa kahana tha ki navaj sharif or america raashtrapati obama ke bich prastaavit vaarta se khaas ummid nahin kii ja sakati
 The reason for this is that the Pakistani Prime Minister cannot proceed on things on which he has agreed at the top negotiating table
 vah apane desh main lautakar sena ke rahamokaram main ho jate hai
 Then he did not lose control over foreign policy in particular
 pakistan ke saath sambandh sudhaarney vaale kadamon main yahi samasya he
 This problem increases the responsibility of India
 hamako seemaa par suraksha sunishchit kerani hogi, pakistani harkaton kaa makul jawaab dena hoga
 There is no other option
 iske alaava bharat kii vaishvik pratishtha ke anuroop apane dayitvon kaa nirvaah bhi karnaa hoga
 Modi's calling of Nawaz Sharif at his swearing-in ceremony and negotiating with him in Ufa was the same responsibility
 bharat main nirvaachit pradhanmantri raashtra kaa vaishvik str par pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The promises he makes are in the form of sustenance
 modi ne vaarta shuru karne kaa vaada kiya
 Only then did he instruct National Security Advisor Ajit Doval to prepare for bilateral talks
 dobhaal ne vaarta se pehle hi puri taiyaari kar lee thi
 He is said to have omitted any point
 sabhi prashn taiyaar kar liye gaye the, jinako pakistan ke sammukh rakhana tha
 Not only this, answers to possible questions were also prepared which the Pakistani side could raise
 itani vyapak taiyaari isliye kii gai, kyonki bhartiya pradhanmantri ne pakistani samakaksh se iskaa vaada kiya tha
 The reality and deep roots of India's democracy can be inferred from this
 duusari ore, pakistan he
 In Ufa, Nawaz agreed that there would be a National Security Advisory-level dialogue on stopping terrorism, and the issue of Kashmir would not be raised in this dialogue
 navaj sharif ke is vaade par pakistani adhikari kis prakaar kii taiyaari kar rahe the, yah dekhnaa dilachasp he
 His preparations were going on to destroy the words of his own Prime Minister
 sharif ne kaha tha ki kashmir kii charchaa nahin hogi, unke adhikari kashmir kaa masalaa uthaane or hurriyat netaaon se mulaakaat kaa prastaav bana rahe the
 It was mischievous preparation
 bharat algaavvaadiyon se vaarta kii pakistani koshishon ke kaaran hi sachiv str kii vaarta sthagit kar chukaa tha
 It is clear that Pakistani officials had deliberately made plans to stop the talks
 tippaniyan This time there were two major reasons behind the Pakistani move to sabotage the talks
 paramparaagat or doosraa tatkaalik kaaran tha
 The traditional reason was that the army wanted to tell the country's elected prime minister its status
 vah bataanaa chaahati thi ki pradhanmantri ke vaadon ko dhul main milaayaa ja saktaa
 The decision of the army is supreme
 taatkaalik kaaran yah ki pakistani rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar sartaaj ajij bhartiya samakaksh ajit dhobhaal kaa saamana karne kii sthiti main hi nahin the
 We must ensure the security of our borders by accepting this reality of Pakistan
 pakistan kii yah hakeekat ek baar phir ujagar hui
 Had there been a responsible country, it would have proceeded in accordance with the good promise made by its elected Prime Minister
 kuch dinon pehle hi upha main navaj sharif ne apane bhartiya samakaksh se vaada kiya tha ki pakistan seemaa par sangharshaviram kaayam rakhega
 In view of this, there will be talks of national security consultants of both the countries
 vastut: iskaa prastaav narendra modi ne kiya tha
 This proposal was in line with India's traditional policy
 modi ne shapath grahan ke avasar par saarc deshon ke shaskaon ko bulaayaa tha
 Its message was clear
 modi bataanaa chaahate the ki bharat apane sabhi padosi deshon ke saath shanti or sauhardpurn sambandh chahta he
 Even at that time, Sharif had praised Modi's efforts, promising cooperation on his behalf
 lekin pakistan lautne ke baad navaj sharif apana vaada nahin nibhaa sake
 The army stopped him from normalizing relations with India
 pakistan ke saath yahi sabase badi samasya he
 The main talks with other countries take place between those in power
 yah nirnay sena nahin karti
 Neither the Prime Minister or the President of any country talks bilaterally with the Pakistan Army Chief
 vaarta to pakistani pradhanmantri se hoti he
 It is on this basis that what will be done in the direction of normalization of relations
 lekin pakistan kii hakeekat sabhi prayaason par pani pher detii he
 India is not the only one troubled by this problem
 yah sanyog tha ki jis samay pakistan rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar str kii vaarta ke maddenjar apana rang dikhaa rahaa tha, usee samay navaj sharif kii oktober main america yatra kaa prastaav banaaya ja rahaa tha
 On this, many responsible senior officials of the US said that the proposed dialogue between Nawaz Sharif and US President Obama cannot be expected much
 iskaa kaaran he ki pakistani pradhanmantri un baton par aage nahin bad sakate, jin par vah sheersh vaarta kii mej par sahmati vyakt kar chuke hote hai
 He returns to his country and becomes in the army's mercy
 tab khaastaur par videsh niti par unka niyantran nahin rah gaya
 This is the problem with steps to improve relations with Pakistan
 yah samasya bharat kii jimmedaari badha detii he
 We will have to ensure security at the border, respond to Pakistani antics
 iskaa doosraa koi vikalp nahin he
 Apart from this, it will also have to discharge its obligations in line with India's global reputation
 modi kaa apane shapath grahan samaaroh main navaj sharif ko bulaanaa tathaa upha main unke saath vaarta karnaa unheen dayitvon kaa nirvaah tha
 The elected Prime Minister in India represents the nation globally
 vah jo vaada karte hai, uske nirvaah kii haisiyat main hote hai
 Modi promised to start the talks
 iske baad hi unhone rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ko dwipaksheeya vaarta kii taiyaari karne kaa nirdesh diya
 Doval had made full preparations before the talks
 bataaya jaataa he ki unhone kisi bhi bindu ko choda nahin tha
 All the questions were prepared which had to be put before Pakistan
 itnaa hi nahin, un sambhavit prashnon kaa jawaab bhi taiyaar kiya gaya tha, jinhen pakistani paksh uthaa saktaa tha
 Such extensive preparations were made because the Indian Prime Minister had promised it to the Pakistani counterpart
 bharat ke prajatantr kii vaastaviktaa or gahari jadon kaa isse anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 On the other side, is Pakistan
 upha main navaj sahamat hue the ki aatankwaad rokane par rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar str kii vaarta hogi, tathaa is vaarta main kashmir kaa masalaa nahin uthaaya jayega
 It is interesting to see what kind of preparations Pakistani officials were making on Nawaz Sharif's promise
 unki taiyaari apane hi pradhanmantri kii baton ko dhwast karne ke liye chal rahi thi
 Sharif had said that Kashmir would not be discussed, his officials were proposing to raise the issue of Kashmir and meet Hurriyat leaders
 yah shararti taiyaari thi
 India had postponed the secretary-level talks due to Pakistani attempts to negotiate with the separatists
 jaahir he ki pakistani adhikari jaanboojhkar vaarta ko rokane kaa plan bana chuke the
 The comments vaarta par pani pherane kii pakistani chaal ke peeche is baar do pramukh kaaran the
 The traditional and second was the immediate cause

 The immediate reason is that Pakistani National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz was not in a position to face Indian counterpart Ajit Dhoval
 pakistan kii is hakeekat ko sweekaar karte hue hamen apni simaaon kii suraksha sunishchit kerani hogi
 In fact, it was proposed by Narendra Modi
 yah prastaav bharat kii paramparaagat niti ke anuroop tha
 Modi had called the rulers of SAARC countries on the occasion of his swearing-in
 iskaa sandesh saaf tha
 Modi wanted to tell that India wants peace and amicable relations with all its neighbors
 us samay bhi sharif ne modi ke prayaason kii saraahna kii thi, apni taraf se sahyog kaa vaada kiya tha
 But Nawaz Sharif could not keep his promise after returning to Pakistan
 sena ne unhen bharat ke saath sambandh saamaanya banane se roak diya

 It was a coincidence that Nawaz Sharif's visit to the US was being made in October at the time when Pakistan was showing its color in view of the National Security Advisor level talks
 is par america ke hi kai jimmedaar varisht adhikariyon kaa kahana tha ki navaj sharif or america raashtrapati obama ke bich prastaavit vaarta se khaas ummid nahin kii ja sakati
 The reason for this is that the Pakistani Prime Minister cannot proceed on things on which he has agreed at the top negotiating table

 Then he did not lose control over foreign policy in particular
 pakistan ke saath sambandh sudhaarney vaale kadamon main yahi samasya he

" ’ dakshin africa or brazil kuch badhyakaari utsarjan katautee ko lekar bharat par dabaav banaate rahe hai

 england main chal rahi pratishthit ashes siries ke pehle test kii pehali pari khatm ho chuki he
 After the end of this innings, let's take a look at the records made so far - England were all out for 430 runs in their first innings
 jo ki pichhali do ashejasiris ke baad uskaa sarvaadhik score he
 2- In the last two Ashes series, England could not cross 400 mark even once
 3- mishael johnson ne apane kariyar me ab tak 21 baar ek pari main 100 se zyada ran die hai, australia ke liye shen worne ke baad duusari sabase zyada baar
 Warne has given more than 100 runs in an innings 40 times
 4- isse pehle sirf ek baar johnson ko ek pari main 100 se zyada ran dene ke baad bhi koi wicket nahin mila tha
 And incidentally that match was also played against England in 2010 at the Gaba ground
 5- england kejo root ne test main apane kariyar kaa sabase tej ardhashtakaisi test main banaaya
 He played just 56 balls to reach 50 runs and during this time his strike rate was 89
 3 kaa rahaa
 6- This half-century is Root's only second half-century in 9 Tests played in the Ashes
 isse pehle unhone 2013 main edilade main 87 ranon kii pari kheli thi

 naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon kii raajnneeti main dada kii entrisorav ganguli kii beti sanaa ganguli ke post par vivadalchha ke virodh se joda gaya post, saurav ne kiya bachaavanaagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ke khilaaf desh ke kai hisson main pradarshan ho rahaa he
 People of all sections are opposing this law
 bhartiya cricket team ke purv captain or bisisiai ke adhyaksh saurav ganguli kii beti sanaa ganguli ne bhi iske virodh main ek post likhi, jisapar vivaad ho gaya
 Ganguly defended his daughter and called her small for politics, but Ganguly's defense of her daughter in this way is being linked to her political ambitions for the future
 kya kahata he sanaa ganguli kaa post?saurav ganguli kii beti sanaa ne apane instagram main ek story post kii, jisamen khushvanth singh kii kitaab The End Of India kaa ek kissa saajha kiya gaya he, jo ki satta, nasleey bhedbhaav par sawaal khadaa karata he
 This was linked to the Citizenship Amendment Act and caused a ruckus on social media
 saurav ganguli ne isko lekar twit kiya or beti kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki vah raajnneetik samaj ko lekar abhi kaaphi choti hai
 Ganguly's questions on the understanding of adult daughter? Sourav Ganguly's daughter Sana Ganguly is 18 years old, born on 3 November 2001
 kanoonee hisaab se dekhen to sanaa ganguli vayask hai or khud apane faisle le sakati hai
 But the way Saurav Ganguly described his post as politically unwise, questions also arise
 gaur karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki 18 saal kii umr main hi bharat main vot dene kaa adhikaar mil saktaa he, yani samvidhan bhi maanata he ki is umr main raajnneetik samaksh paripakv ho jaati he or yuva apane janpratinidhi or sarkaar chun saktaa he
 But Ganguly's argument does not match this
 ganguli kaa bachaav, bhavishya kii soch?beete lambey samay se aise kayaas lagate aae hai ki saurav ganguli bengal ke mukhyamantri pad ke liye bhartiya janata party kaa cheharaa ho sakate hai
 However, this has been denied by both sides, but speculation continues
 beete dinon jab saurav ganguli, bisisiai ke adhyaksh bane to grih mantri or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke bete jai shah bisisiai main sachiv bane
 After this there was a discussion on the growing relationship between BJP and Sourav Ganguly 
 ab jab desh mennaagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ke khilaaf virohjoro par he or har vipakshi netaa modi sarkaar ko samvidhan virdohi qaraar dene par laga he
 In such a situation, a post coming on behalf of Sourav Ganguly's daughter may spoil his future political debut
 bengal main 2021 main hi vidhansabha chunaav hone hai or abhi shuruaati samay main bataur bisisiai adhyaksh ganguli kaa kaarykaal 9 maheene kaa hi he
 Sourav Ganguly would not like to spoil the recent good relations with the BJP and the central government with an Instagram post like this
 yahi kaaran he ki purajor tareeke se vah beti ke instagram post ko CAA se alag bataa rahe hai
 Dada can become King in Bengal? Mamata Banerjee is the Chief Minister in West Bengal
 bhartiya janata party unke khilaaf chunaav kii taiyaari to kar rahi he lekin rajya main abhi bhi use ek bade chehre kii jarurat he
 In the eyes of political experts, Sourav Ganguly can take that place
 prince of kolkata, bengal tiger ke naam se mashhoor saurav ganguli aaj bhi bengal main ek bada brands hai, jiskaa phayda bijepi uthaanaa chaahegi
 However, recently Union Home Minister and BJP President Amit Shah said that his party has not spoken to Sourav Ganguly for any such plan and neither has any such desire been expressed by Ganguly
