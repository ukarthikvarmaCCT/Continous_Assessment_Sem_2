 The Delhi Jal Board filed a petition in the NGT stating that it is going to stop water supply in Delhi as the amount of ammonia in the water has increased three times and the reason for the increase is the polluted water coming from Haryana
 engiti ke justise javed rahim ke bench main dilli jal board kii taraf se arji daakhil kii gai he ki puri dilli kii pani kii supplai roki padegi kyonki ammonia kii maatra pani me teen guna bad gai he
 After this, the NGT immediately heard the case on an urgent basis, in which Delhi Jal Board counsel said that immediately we have to stop the supply of water

 The amount of ammonia in water is currently 115 to 218 ppm (parts per million) whereas the amount of ammonia in drinking water should be less than 15

 The Water Board is not able to provide water to 35 per cent of Delhi's population every day as it is short of 70 to 80 million gallons of water, the increased level of ammonia will increase this problem many times
 dilli jal board ke taraf se engiti main ye bhi kaha gaya ki 31 disambar 2017 ke baad se ammonia kii maatra main lagaataar badhotaree ho rahi he ye pehali baar hua he ki 45 dinon se ammonia kii maatra main kami nahi ai he lihaaja haryana se aane vaali pani ko rokna hoga or wazirabad plant main store kiye hue pani ko treet karnaa hoga

 This is the first case in the history of the last 238 years of Badrinath Dham, when the chief priest of the temple is arrested by the police
 iske pehle 1957 main rawal vasudev namboodri ko bhi ek maamle main badri-kedaar samiti ne hataa diya tha
 He was accused of molesting the daughter of an employee working in the temple committee but the arrest was not made
 uske baad 2000 main rawal vishnu namboodri or mandir samiti ke adhyaksh vinod nautial ke bich vivaad ke chalate vishnu ne apane pad se istipha diya tha
 Apart from this, this Dham and the Rawals here never got caught in big controversies

 The incident in Delhi has hurt the sentiments of millions of people who revered Badrinath

 “the British had enacted separate legislation for the arrangements of Badrinath in 1939, in which written provisions were made not only for the arbitrariness of the Rawls but also for restraining their conduct
 madhu bhatta kahati hai, ''badrinaath main puja ke dauraan rawal ko sakht paramparaon kaa paalan karnaa padataa he
 Taking bath several times a day, restrained food and not going out of Badrinathpuri are taboo, which is strictly followed

 He was reporting about the loss of the gods

 If these deities made him angry, Vidhu Vinod Chopra's film and Raju Hirani-directed Aamir Khan's film PK would not have been so successful
 bhakton se bhari hui yah duniya bhi naaraaz hui hoti to usne sava do sau karod is film ko nahin die hote
 But some of the gurus, mahants, babas sitting in temples-mosques, churches and monasteries standing between the gods and those who believe in them are annoyed that PK has mocked them
 iske peeche ve apane-apane dhang se apane-apane panth kaa apmaan dekh rahe hai
 No, PK is not a great film
 vah ek kaarobaari film hi he jo manoranjan karti he
 Of course, while doing this entertainment, she attacks some superstitions, draws attention to some hypocrisy
 lekin yah film bhakton kii kalai kholti he, magar bhagwaan se dar jaati he
 She does not even try to put any god, any deity, any monastery in the dock
 use andaaza he ki hindustan ko bhale isaki zarurat ho, lekin dharm or siyasat kii dukaane chalaane waalon ko ye manzur nahin hoga
 But if PK is afraid of God, then the contractors of religion are scared of PK
 kyonki unhen bhi bhagwaan ko nahin, apane us paakhand ko bachaana he jisase unki dukaan chalati he
 In this India, the examination of the gods has become much more stringent

 It scares modernity, scares openness, scares entertainment, and also intimidates harmony

 After the bowling of Ashwin against Jos Buttler, there is a fear among the legendary batsmen around the world
 yahi kaaran he ki aswin kii gendbaaji ke dauraan koi bhi non striker and par khadaa ballebaaj krij chhodkar ran lene ke liye gend ke phenke jane se pehle baahar nahin nikalataa
 a live example of this was seen during the match played between Delhi and Punjab on Saturday
 darasal, dilli kii team ballebaaji kar rahi thi
 r Ashwin was ready for the third ball of the 12th over
 saamne the shreyas ayyar jo shot khilne ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar the
 Ashwin came to the ball and reached the crease with a runup and stopped suddenly when Shikhar Dhawan, standing at the non-striker end, looked rapidly towards Ashwin and came in and out
 iske baad unhone baithkar pair kii movement dikhaai
 However, another interesting incident was observed in this over
 teesri gend ke liye ek baar phir aswin rabip lekar aae or ayyar ko gend daali
 But as he delivered the ball, Dhawan, standing at the non-striker end, did an interesting act to tease him

 Punjab captain and bowler Ashwin fires the Mankanding controversy by throwing out Jos Buttler standing at the non-striking end without throwing the ball
 unhone out karne se pehle butler ko chetavanee bhi nahin di thi
 After this, the Merylbon Cricket Club (MCC), which is considered the guardian of cricket laws, including the legendary players, had described Ashwin's actions against the spirit of the game
 emsisi ne kaha, ‘maamle kii samiksha karne ke baad hamen nahin lagata ki yah khel bhaavana ke tahat tha
 We believe that Ashwin took longer between arriving at the crease and stopping
 aise main ballebaaj ummid karata he ki gend phenk di gai he
 Butler may have thought that the ball was thrown and he was in his zone
 ’vahiin, purv bhartiya cricketer madan laal ne kaha ki aswin ko isse bachanaa chahie tha
 He said, 'looking at Ashwin's level and international career, i don't think he did it right
 vah bahut bade khilaadi he or aisi harakat kaaphi choti cheez he
 If there was a Virat Kohli or any other Indian player in place of Butler, he would have got a lot of criticism
 aisi harakat khel kaa hissaa nahin he
 Ashwin is right in his place
 lekin, unhen aisa nahin karnaa chahie tha
 England captain Eoin Morgan said, 'I can't believe what i saw
 yuva khilaadiyon ke liye galat misaal kaayam kii gai
 Ashwin will definitely regret it
 ' england ke khilaadi jesan raay ne kaha, 'aswin kaa yah stabdh karne vaala bartaav tha

 co / yrmpov2j1d On the last day of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) 's three-day' india-rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's vision of the future ', Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat answered several of the 215 questions related to 25 topics
 inamen kai vishay to sangh ke pasandida rahe to kai anachaahe vishyon par bhagwat ne khulkar jawaab die
 Let's look at Bhagwat's opinion on these 10 big issues
 Hinduism galat shabdasangh pramukh mohan bhagwatne kaha ki hindutv, Hinduness, Hinduism galat shabd hai, ism (ism) ek band cheez maani jaati he, yah koi ism nahin he
 Continuous search for truth is called Hinduism
 satat chalane vaali prakriya he
 Therefore, one should not say Hinduism
 hindutv hi he jo sabake saath talmail kaa aadhaar ho saktaa he
 The people living in India are Hindus
 kuch log hindutv ke bare jaanate hai, lekin bolne main sankoch karte hai
 Some people do not know
 bharat main koi paraayaapan nahin, paraayaapan hamane hi banaaya he
 It is a process that goes on
 gandhi ji ne kaha tha ki satya kii anwarat khoj kaa naam hindutv he, es radhakrishnan kaa kathan he ki hindutv ek satat chalane vaali prakriya he
 2
 goraksha hinsa or mob linchingsangh pramukh bhagwatne kaha ki goraksha main jude logon ko mob linching se jodna thik nahin he
 Violence on a question is a crime and action should be taken on it, but cow is a matter of traditional reverence
 apane desh main arthayam kaa aadhaar gaay ban sakati he
 Must be guarded
 samvidhan kaa yah maardarshak tatv bhi he
 It is necessary to keep the cow
 khulaa chhod denge to ghatnaayen hongi
 The work of cow protection should be encouraged
 gau taskaron ke hamale par aawaaj nahin uthaai jaati
 We should leave this double instinct
 3
 Section 370 and Article 35 Singh chief Bhagwat said that our views on Article 370 and Article 35A are paramount
 ham unako nahin maanate, yani wo donon nahin rahanaa chahie, ye hamaara mat he
 4
 ram janmabhumi par bhavy mandirsangh pramukh bhagwat ne kaha ki ram mandir par adhyadesh kaa maamla sarkaar ke paas he or aayojan kaa maamla ramajanm bhoomi mukti sangharsh samiti ke paas he or donon main main nahin hum
 The High Powered Committee has to decide what to do in the movement
 agar vah salaah maangegi to main bataaungaa
 As a Sangh, i wish that a grand temple on Ram Janmabhoomi should be built soon
 bhagwaan ram apane desh ke bahusankhya logon ke liye bhagwaan hai lekin ve keval bhagwaan nahin hai
 People consider him as imam-e-hind
 isliye jahaan ram janmabhumi he vahaan mandir bananaa chahie
 5
 sanskrit kaa mahatvabhagwat ne kaha ki sanskrit ko ham mahatv nahin dete, isliye sarkaar bhi nahin detii, yadi hamaara aagrah rahe ki apni parampara kaa sara sahitya sanskrit main he, isliye ham sanskrit seekhen, yadi yah hamaara maanas bane to apni viraasat kaa adhyayan bhi thik se ho sakegaa
 Bhagwat said that according to his tradition a new education policy should be formulated
 nai shiksha niti aane vaali he, ummid he usamen hamaari parampara samahit hogi
 The study of texts is compulsory in education, such is the view of the Sangh
 6
 No enmity with language Bhagavata said that English is on our mind and not in the policy regulator
 maatrubhaashaon ko sammaan dena shuru karen
 Have complete knowledge of your language
 kisi bhashaa se shatruta nahin kerani chahie
 Do not remove English, keep it in place
 desh kii unnati ke naate hamaari rashtrabhasha ko sthaan mili, yah jaruri he
 Work has to be done in Hindi, so people from other provinces learn Hindi, Hindi speakers should also learn one language of another province, this will help in quick reconciliation, and this work will be done quickly
 7
 Supporting inter-caste marriage Bhagwat said that we support inter-caste marriage
 maanav-maanav main bhed nahin karnaa chahie
 The Sangh volunteers in India have the highest number of inter-caste marriages
 samaaj ko abhed drushti se dekhnaa jaruri he
 Hindu society will not be divided by this
 isliye ham sabhi hinduon ko sangathit karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 8
 aarakshan kaa samarthanabhagwatne kaha ki saamaajik vishmata ko dur karne ke liye samvidhan main jahaan jitna aarakshan diya gaya he, sangh kaa uskaa samarthan rahegaa
 The decision of how long the reservation will last will be decided by those for whom the reservation has been fixed
 saamaajik vishmata hataakar sabake liye barabari ho isliye samvidhan main praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Therefore, all reservations provided by the Constitution have full support from the Sangh
 aarakshan samasya nahin, aarakshan par jari raajnneeti samasya he
 9
 sarasanghachaalak kaa chunaavamohan bhagwatne kaha, 'sangh main sarasanghachaalak kaa chunaav nahin hota
 i will decide how long i will stay
 mere baad sarasanghachaalak koun hoga yah bhi main tay karunga, lekin sangh ke saare adhikaar sangh ke sah kaarywah ke paas hote hai or jo sah kaarywah kahenge wo mujhe karnaa anivaary hai
 Co-working is selected at an interval of 3 years

 Homosexuality is common in some people (homosexuality)
 aise log samaaj ke andar hi hai isliye unki vyavastha samaaj ko kerani chahie
 There is no use in making an issue or making a noise
 samaaj bahut badal chukaa he isliye samaaj swasth rahe taaki ve (samalangik) alag-thalag padakar gart main na gir jaaen
 Nitin Gadkari was scheduled to be elected bjp's national president for the second time in 2013
 lekin aakhri maukey par unke khilaaf tabadatod iskar vibhaag ke chaape pade or phir unhen adhyaksh pad se hatana padaa tha, is baat ko lekar kendriya rajmarg or sadak parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ko aaj bhi malaal he
 Irked by the allegations, Gadkari said in the special program 'sidhi Baat' of 'ajatak' that even today he is sorry about the situation that had to be removed at that time from the post of BJP President
 kyonki jo bhi aarope lagaae gaye the vobebuniyaadathe
 Talking to Shweta Singh, Gadkari said, 'I was saying that i am innocent
 lekin mujhe sajishan doshi tehraaya gaya
 For two years, the Congress government conducted an investigation against me and my family and also gave a clean cheat
 'kabhi bijepi adhyaksh nahin banuungagadakari bataate hai ki kuch din ke liye wo behad pareshaan ho gaye the
 The case was investigated for two years
 phir usee congress sarkaar main hi nirdosh sabit hue
 But i had decided that 'I will never become a BJP President now'
 iskaa dukh or dard hameshaa rahegaa ki media se un chizon ko khub dikhaaya gaya jo sach nahin tha
 The Congress had launched a campaign against me in a way
 2 saal tak rahaa pareshaan'sidhi baat' main gadakari ne kaha, 'mere main bhi kuch dosha hai

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Dream Project Bullet Train is now seen in controversies
 bhoomi adhigrahan ko lekar gujarat main kisaanon kaa virodh samasya paidaa kar rahaa he
 Farmers do not want to give their land for this project
 lihaaja wo jameen adhigrahan kaa kadaa virodh kar rahe hai
 Farmers say they were called for a short meeting on Monday
 ravivaar ko samachar patron main neshnal hai speed rail corporation ke jariye is baithak ke sambandh main jaankaree di gai thi
 According to the farmers, the information published in the newspaper said that this second meeting is being called for land acquisition, but the reality is that the first meeting was not called
 kisaanon kaa sawaal he ki pehali baithak bulaae bina duusari baithak kaise bulaai ja sakati he? iske alaava is baithak ko lekar kisaanon ko vyaktigat jaankaree nahin di gai
 Farmers got information about this from the media
 kisaanon kaa kahana he kijameen adhigrahanko lekar unase baaten chhupaai ja rahi he
 Regarding this, farmers have also submitted memorandum to Vadodara and Bharuch collector based on their demand
 kisaanon ke haq ke liye kaam kar rahe hasmukh bhatta kaa kahana he ki aaj kii keemat ke hisaab se kisaanon kii jameen kaa muaavja milanaa chahie
 Also, farmers are given full time for this, only then they will allow them to acquire their land
 vahiin, maamle main neshnal hai speed rail corporation kii ore se sunwaayee karne aae pike datta kaa kahana he ki jo bhi kaarywahi ho rahi he, wo railway ke niyamon ke mutabik hi ho rahi he
 However, the way farmers have come out against the acquisition of land for the Isbulate train project, it seems that the railways will have to struggle a lot in acquiring land

 Along with this, Bhagat is a four-time MLA and he is being pushed forward, with political observers saying that this was done with the objective of creating an alternative power center in front of Singhdev in Ambikapur division

 kis tarah insaaniyat ke in nasuron kaa oparation karke inhen iraq se jahannam bheja jayega, ye sab, ab duniya bahut jald dekhegi
 Because airbarns are coming
 ye duniya ke wo sabase khatarnaak commando hai, jo goli pehle maarthe hai sunate baad main hai
 If Baghdadi dies, Khair is freed from worldly troubles, but if he is alive, then tie one thing to the knots that these commands come to his own, then he will also drag him from hell
 ye america kii ye wo fouj he jiskaa koi bhi oparation ab tak naakaamayaab nahin hua
 Each of its soldiers has the power of a troop in itself
 ab yahi force iraq main ghusane ja rahi he
 Here, they will be broken on Baghdadi's terrorists
 ye to sirf trailor tha
 Celebrate those who have died
 jo zindaa hai wo uuparavaale se minnaten karen
 The only rule to land these commandos in Mosul via the sky is that the US government does not want to prolong this ongoing war with ISIS in Iraq
 khaas baat ye he ki bagdadi ke khatme ke liye ab tak america zamin par lard rahi duusari phujon ko madad dene ke saath-saath apni taraf se sirf aasamaani hamale kar rahaa tha
 But now the US Army Combat Team is landing on Iraqi ground for the Airbarn Full and Final Mission
 jo ISIS ke aatankiyon ko sidhe goli maaregi
 Airborne Commandos * Airbarn is the world's most trend light infantry
 *america sena kii ranneetik mobile tukdi he
 * This troop was formed during the First World War
 *iraq afghanistan samet kai deshon main oparation kiya
 Shankaracharya Swaroopananda Saraswati is again in controversy by making another strange statement against Sai Baba
 apane grihnagar siwani main shankaracharya ne sai baba ko 'vaishya putr' bataate hue kaha ki unhone apane pita or vaishya kii santan ke rup main janm liya
 Shankaracharya said, 'it has been reported in the internet that Pindari Bahruddin, who was from Afghanistan, came to Ahmednagar and lived with a prostitute
 vahiin ye chand miyaan paidaa hue, jo shiridy kaa sai baba he
 This is visible in the Internet, you can see it yourself
 
 
 'shankaracharya yaheen nahin ruke
 He described the growing devotees of Sai Baba as an infectious disease, 'hindu will remain a Hindu, no matter who is a devotee of anyone, he will finally show that he is a Hindu
 ham log jo baat kah rahe hai, wo duusari drushti se kah rahe hai
 For example, understand, as Bangla disease occurs, the eye becomes red, people say that it is not an infectious disease, stay away
 vaise hi ye sankramak rog jaisaa fail rahaa he
 If any person has even a little trouble, then he goes to Sayin Baba
 'jab shankaracharya se poocha gaya ki kahin unhen irshyaa to nahin ho rahi he, jo wo achaanak sai baba ke khilaaf lagaataar bol rahe hai, to shankaracharya ne kaha ki sai ke bhakt hindu dharm ke anuyaayiyon ko thag rahe hai, jo aapattijanak he
 Shankaracharya said, we are not jealous of him, but have objection
 aaj unke jo anuyaayi hai, wo sai ko viraat rup main dikhaa rahe hai
 He is shown playing Bansi, showing as Sheshnag, showing somewhere as an avatar
 is tarah hindu dharm ke anuyaayiyon ko thag rahe hai
 In his hometown Seoni, Shankaracharya also spoke strongly about the Sai temple and its tribes
 shankaracharya ke tevar dekhakar to yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki yah vivaad itani jaldi thamane vaala nahin he

 Tax is much higher here than in Europe and China
 aise main kis tarah se ummid kii ja sakati he ki yahaan zyada se zyada log car aford kar saken
 Earlier, on this statement of the Finance Minister, executive director of marketing and sales of Maruti Suzuki, Shashank Srivastava had said that Ola and Uber are not solid reasons for the slowdown in the auto industry

 jaahir he ki modi nahin chaahate ki unke khilaaf is report par koi charchaa yaa jaanch ho
 The CAG report kept in the Gujarat Legislative Assembly states that the government companies sold gas to the private company for less than the purchase, causing a loss of crores

 There, the Congress has targeted the Raman Singh government over the coal block allocation scam
 congress kahati he ki chhattisgarh mineral deveopment kattarporation (siemdisi) ko 2007 main centre ne shankarpur block main do ekstansion aavantit kiye the lekin siemdisi ne nitin gadakari ke kareebi sancheti bandhu kii company esemes inphra ke saath sanyukt upkram kar liya
 The Chhattisgarh CAG report says that there is a possibility of loss of one thousand 52 crore rupees from it but BJP is giving it a clean
 udhar, bihar main bhi kaig report ko lekar endie kaa doharaa maapdand saamne aayaa he
 The Accountant General exposed the case of not getting the expenditure of 25 thousand crores in the state in the last few years

 iske alaava rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan main dhaandhlee kii bhi baat saamne ai he

 vahaan kol block aavanton ghotaale par congress ne raman singh sarkaar ko nishaanaa banaaya hua he
 The Congress says that in 2007, the Center was allotted two extensions in the Shankarpur block to the Chhattisgarh Mineral Development Corporation (CMDC) but the CMDC entered into a joint venture with SMS Infra, a company of Sancheti brothers close to Nitin Gadkari
 chhattisgarh sieji report kahati he ki isse ek hazaar 52 karod rupee ke nuqasaan kaa andeshaa he lekin bijepi isaki safaai de rahi he

 Nirmala Venkatesh, who was removed from the National Commission for Women, says that there has been a political conspiracy against me
 nirmala kaa kahana he ki unke saath anyaay hua he or wo anyaay ke khilaaf supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataayengin
 Significantly, the responsibility of investigation was given to Nirmala in the case of misbehavior with girls in a pub in Mangalore
 wo teen sadasyeey jaanch team kii pramukh thim
 In his report, he accused the owners of the pub that he did not make security arrangements
 unki is report par hangaamaa much gaya tha jise baad main khaarij kar diya gaya
 Later, the Ministry of Women and Child Development sent its separate team to investigate the matter
 jab-jab aisa lagane lagata he ki aatank se raahat milane vaali he
 Then, another news comes, which instead of relief, causes panic
 duniya ko abhi laga hi tha ki iesas kaa khaatmaa kareeb he or tabhi iesas ne apana aakhri daanv khel diya
 The stakes also doubled in one stroke
 khabar ye he ki bagdadi ne gathbandhan kar liya he
 al-qaeda from the dreaded terrorist organization like myself
 ab is gathbandhan kaa nateeja kya hoga
 It is difficult to guess this now
 ISIS ne alqaida se milaayaa haaydavatein bhi thi
 There were also shades
 dushmani bhi thi
 But the script of the world of terror says that if there is trouble in front, then you should join hands with each other
 usee main bhalaai he
 These are the last attempts to find hope in the hope of the terrorists born from the current situation in Iraq and Syria
 jo iesas ne aatank kii duniya ke apane sabase bade dushman alqaida se haath milakar kii he
 In order to save their desolate Sultanate, Baghdadi enforced Jawahiri
 
 And Zawahiri has raised his hand towards Baghdadi
 
 Hand of friendship of terrorist 
 So that the name remains
 
 ISIS as well as Al Qaeda
 
 Otherwise, the situation has been created in Iraq and Syria
 
 Neither is Baghdadi's well being alone in that
 
 Nor that of the Nusra Front of Al Qaeda
 
 G
 Nusra Front
 
 By the same name, Al Qaeda is fighting the Assad government as a rebel in Syria
 
 The Vice President of Iraq Revealed This terror alliance has not been disclosed by any agency but by Iraqi Vice President Ayad Alvi
 zaahir he in daavon main kuch to sanjidagi hogi hi he
 And if so, at least this is not good news for those who are living in their clutches in Iraq and Syria
 ham ye to nahin kah sakate ki kab se magar itnaa tay he ki donon aatanki sanghathanon main baatcheet jari he
 The mediators of Baghdadi and Jawahiri are talking about an alliance among themselves
 khatm nahin hoga iesas kaa aatankise main bina kisi road map
 It will be difficult to control the situation after the war of support and political intervention
 jaisaa ki ham jaanate hai ki agar iraq se iesas ko khatm bhi kar liya jaae to bhi wo marane vaala nahin he
 These wars are going to be prolonged because ISIS has now spread all over the world
 hamaare paas puri jaankaree he ki donon aatanki sanghathan milakar ladane kii planning kar rahe hai
 So even after their elimination from here, their slipper cells will be present in the whole world
 aatankiyon ke paas bachane kaa ek hi tareekairaq main iesas ke tazaa halaat ye hai ki iraqi-america phujon, kurdish fiteron or shiya milicia ne kareeb kareeb inkaa kaam tamaam kar diya he
 And now these traces are left only to a few villages in Mosul
 vahiin rus ke saath milakar syrian phujon ne bhi takreeban takreeban yahi haal apane desh main alqaida kaa bhi kar diya he
 In such a situation, now both of them have the only way left
 apni jaan bachaane kaa bhi or apana naam bachaane kaa bhi
 Both the terrorist organizations which came together to realize the danger, however, ISIS was the branch of Al Qaeda till 2003
 magar saddaam ke takhta palat ke baad khud ko khalipha ghoshit karne or apana alag sanghathan banane kii sanak main bagdadi ne iesas banaaya
 And because of his impunity, this organization of Baghdadi managed to create panic all over the world along with Iraq and Syria
 duusari taraf alqaida ko apane hi astitv par khatra nazar aane laga
 Therefore, both groups were fighting a war of supremacy for the last 5-6 years
 magar ab donon ko ye samaj main aa gaya he ki varchasv kii jang to tab hogi jab naam zindaa bachegaa or isiilie donon taraf se aatank kii dosti kaa haath aage badha he or duniya ke liye ab khatre kii baat ye he ki ye donon khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan shaayad ab ek saath hai
 Chemical attack on the army and ISIS terrorists on their way through Syria want the ultimate blow on their enemies
 aatankwaadiyon kaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi pehle hi maidan e jang se peeth dikhaa kar bhaag chukaa he, vahiin mosul main bache-khuche aatankwaadi fouj par chemical atake kar rahe hai
 In the last two days, these terrorists have carried out two chemical attacks
 aise main in hamalon kaa sabase bada khatara jang ke bich fanse begunaah shahriyon ke sir par mandara rahaa he
 There is an old saying, the thief should go by stealing, but do not go through the sin
 iraq main iesas ke aatankwaadiyon kii haalat bilkul aisi hi he
 Attacked by Mustard Gas, the situation of militants in the ongoing war between the army and ISIS in Mosul, one of the important bases of IS, is getting increasingly thin
 lekin jate-jate bhi ye aatankwaadi fuj par chemical atake karne se nahin chook rahe hai
 Iraqi forces have been attacked in Mosul's al-abar area with terrifying mustard gas, which can kill people in an instant
 america or austrailia jaise mulkon kii madad se iraqi fuj lagaataar iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ko desh se khadedane main juty he
 The three-day Jammu bandh has been widely affected by the demand for AIIMS
 band ke duusare din shanivaar ko ames koordination kamity ke logon ko bijepi mukhyalay par virodh pradarshan se rokane ke liye police ko aansu gas ke gole bhi chhodane pade or lathi charge bhi kiya gaya
 The 72-hour Jammu bandh of the AIIMS Coordination Committee, which was agitating in the city to demand the announcement of AIIMS in Jammu, saw widespread impact
 band ko safal banane ke liye samarthak sadakon par utre or jammu city ke kai ilaakon main juluus nikle
 The committee members tried several times to support the bandh outside the BJP headquarters
 lekin police ne unhen vahaan jane nahin diya
 Tension spread in the area after the police, who were present at several places, left tear gas shells to stop the clash
 logon kaa bijepi ke khilaaf gussa itnaa he ki duusare din bhi jammu main skool, college,daftar band rahe or parichaalan thap rahaa
 Its effect was seen in other districts also
 ames koordination kamity ne jammu-kashmir ke swasth mantri choudhary laal singh ke is bayaan ko bhi khaarij kar diya he ki sarkaar kashmir or jammu ke liye alag-alag do ames banaaegi
 The committee says that the protests will continue until Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley or Prime Minister Narendra Modi dares to grant AIIMS to Jammu

 There is always scope for mistake in this

 This will help in accurately estimating fog and snowfall
 wedar baloon, yani mausam kaa pataa lagane ke liye chode jane vaale gubaare
 Let us tell you that the weather balloons are released daily from 39 weather stations across the country
 ab tak in wedar balunon par mausam vaigyanik jameen se najar rakh kar aankade ekatrit karte the, lekin ab in wedar balunon main jeepies laga diya gaya he
 This will give accurate data of temperature, air pressure and wind speed at every altitude
 rajdhani dilli main ayanagar se bhi is tarah ke wedar balun aasmaan main chode jate hai
 These weather balloons are equipped with GPS temperature and air pressure sensors
 wedar balun kii keemtek wedar balun kii keemat takreeban 15,000 rupye padati he
 There are many benefits of leaving Weather Balloon with GPS
 isse data sidhe dharti par mausam centre ko lagaataar miltaa rahata he
 The weather balloon explodes at an altitude of about 40 kilometers
 mausam vibhaag ab desh ke sabhi wedar stesan se chode jane vaale wedar balunon ko jeepies se las karke hi chhodega
 On the one hand, where it will be able to get accurate weather data to a great height, on the other hand these data can be analyzed in real time in a supercomputer
 isse barfbaari or kohre jaisi chizon kaa anumaan sahi-sahi kiya ja sakegaa

 In this holiday season, most people will have to guess how much effort is required to get a train ticket
 aise hi halaat se nibatane ke liye railway ne tatkaal seva shuru kii thi
 But are people getting the benefit of this service
 zyaadaatar logon kaa jawaab hoga nahin
 Till date, it has raised the question that what is the immediate game in Indian Railways and who are its big players
 garmi kii chuttee par janaa ho yaa phir kisi jarur kaam se, is mausam main rail kaa ek tikat hasil kar paanaa bhi mushkil kaam he
 Where there is a long list of waiting
 aap internet ke jariye online booking karwaaie yaa phir ghanton qatari main khadey rahiye, haath lagegi sirf niraashaa hi
 Regardless of the railway station in the country, there is chaos everywhere
 nai dilli railway stesan par kai ghanton ke intjaar ke baad bhi zyaadaatar log khaali haath lautne ko majaboor hai
 This condition of Tatkal tickets is almost at every big and big station
 railway stesan se tatkaal kaa tikat lene aae zyaadaatar musafiron ko lagata he ki unki ye musiibat isliye he kyonki saare tikat website ke jariye online book ho jate hai
 Online booking also starts at eight o'clock, counters do not open even by railways, booking from NATE opens at eight o'clock, it is blocked here
 lekin net se booking kaa bhi vahi haal he
 Surprisingly, the website starts working perfectly shortly after 8 o'clock in the morning
 lekin tab tak saare tikat book ho jate hai
 Tatkal tickets are neither available to the people standing in the queue at the counter since morning nor to those sitting eyeing the internet
 sawaal ye ki tatkaal seva ke saare tikat aakhir kahaan se book ho rahe hai? aaj tak ne is sawaal kaa jawaab online rigerveshan website kaa kaam sanbhaalane vaali iarsitisi ke adhikariyon se jaanane kii koshish kii, lekin camere ke saamne koi nahin aayaa
 Yes, the CPRO of Northern Railway did show some kindness
 uttari railway ke seepiaro anand swaroop kaa kahana he ki ye jo website he iskaa kaam iarsitisi dekhati he or wo hamaari baat un tak pahunchaa denge
 There are around 12 thousand counters of instant service across the country
 railway adhikariyon kaa daawa he ki itane log jab ek saath counter par tikat book karaate he to website krash ho jaati he
 But the reality of railway counters is that most people return there empty handed
 matlab ye ki tikat counter par khadey logon ko galatfahami he ki tamaam tikat online book ho jate hai or online booking karne waalon ko lagata he ki sari booking counter par ho gai
 In the name of technology and congestion, the brokers and railway officials get all the rubbish between the confusion and some misconceptions are left among the people that the crowd is too much nowadays

 At the same time, the Congress is constantly trying to bring Diya Kumari to the party in the name of Rajput face
 haalanki diya kumari congress main jane kii sambhaavnaaon ko khaarij kar rahi hai
 bjp's strategy: On the other hand, Vasundhara Raje has made a dent in the Congress stronghold Jaipur, Kota
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ladpura vidhansabha seat se tikat nahin milane se naaraaz kota ke purv saansad congress netaa ijyaraj singh bijepi kaa daaman tham sakate hai
 BJP can make his wife Kalpana Singh a candidate from Ladpura by cutting the ticket of Bhavani Singh Rajawat
 agar aisa hota he to kota ke raajnneeti main ek bada pherbadal hoga

 No Topic Treatment: As the role of capital became decisive in the Indian society, all our values became irrelevant one by one
 hamaare sochane ke tareeke or pratimaan badal gaye
 The qualities of a person became flawed as the pattern changed
 saamaajik vyakti kii jagah aatmakendrit vyakti kaa udai hua, jiske liye rishte-naate desh-samaaj aadi kaa matlab sirf apane swaarth kii purti karnaa rah gaya
 In such an environment the destiny of people living and walking with their human values is bound to be tragic
 varisht kathakaar hridayesh kaa upanyaas chaar darvesh traasad niyati vaale aise hi chaar bujurgon kii katha he
 Through the narrative of four old men named Ramprasad, Shivshankar, Dilipchand and Chintasharan Sharma, Hridayesh has in a way told the disintegration of values in Indian society
 ye chaaron buudhe ek jaise na hokar apni prakruti or mi
 Jazz are completely different from each other
 lekin alag-alag jivan sthitiyon main rahete hue bhi unki niyati ek he
 Ramprasad lives in his home with daughter-in-law
 dhire-dhire sthiti yah ho jaati he ki apane hi ghar main ve ek nirvasit or upekshit jivan jeene ko majaboor ho jate hai
 Not being able to live according to the will of his own house and not even fulfilling his small desires and needs is at the core of his tragedy
 kute ke kaatane se antat ek din unki maut ho jaati he
 Shivshankar agrees to leave his good social life by selling his house at the behest of his son
 unki asal traasadee yaheen se shuru hoti he
 He was constantly choking in the isolation of his life and the stranger atmosphere of the city
 sthiti yah he ki pehle unka phone swissof bataa rahaa tha, ab udhar se sandesh aata he ki dis number das note ek

 The wife says that she loves someone else and asks permission to go to him

 She is with her aunt in old age, who herself has come to them after being tortured by her son

 Chintasharan's personality is more vibrant than these three

 But one day he gets kidnapped and his sons show no activity in getting him released

 The novel states that it is almost impossible to live with the values of human dignity in this gluttonous time-lapse of marketism and consumerism
 upanyaas prakarantar se vartmaan vikaas ke peeche kii us asli sachaai ko ujagar karata he, jahaan maanviya mulyon kii hatya ek anivaary tatv he
 Hridayesh has been very successful in exposing the cruelty, horrors and pricelessness of this time driven by capital through a creative work
 katha vinyas ko sanyojit karne main unhone ek paripakv lekhkeey drushti darshai he
 They have put together the life situation and thinking of the old and the new generation, by which the whole picture of the disintegration of values emerges automatically
 is drushti se yah upanyaas hridayesh kii ek rachanaatmak uplabdhi he
 This achievement could have been greater if they could have exposed the duality of the new generation
 yah upanyaas bahulansh main ek sapaat rachana he, tabhi mahatvapurn vishaywastu ke hote hue bhi hamaari samvednaa ko chhu nahin paata
 There is a lack of creative tension needed to make the composition effective
 kai baat aisa mahasoos hota he ki baat ko jabaran aage khinchaa-badhaayaa ja rahaa he
 This is to say that to highlight the ugliness and irony of modern times, Hridayesh has raised the subject very well but has not been able to give him better treatment

 The comments yash chopra nirdeshit film 'dar' main shahrukh ne psico aashiq kii bhoomika nibhaai thi
 It was a character that elevated Shah Rukh's stardom and despite being a villain, Shah Rukh became the hero of the film
 siddharth bhi abhi yuva hai or unki pichhali kai filmein naakaam rahi hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why Siddharth wants a film like Shahrukh to be played so that the character can make him stand out and stand out from other stars
 siddharth malhotra ne film 'ek vilan' main gunde kii bhoomika nibhaai thi magar wo film kaa khalanaayak nahin tha
 But the romantic film 'hansi To Fansi' and the action film 'brother' flopped
 aise main siddharth jaanate hai ki varun dhawan jaise apane pratidwandiyon ke saamne khadaa hone ke liye kuch alag karnaa hoga or shaayad yahi vajah he ki siddharth shahrukh jaisi bhoomika, kuch mazedaar dabl role vaali film yaa koi negative role kii talash main hai siddharth
 Shah Rukh played the role of Psycho Aashiq in the Yash Chopra-directed film Der
 yah aisa kirdaar tha, jisane shahrukh ke staradam ko upar uthaaya tha or vilan hote hue bhi shahrukh film ke hero ban gaye the
 Siddharth is still young and many of his previous films have failed
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki siddharth chaahate hai ki shahrukh jaisi bhoomika vaali film chaahate hai taaki vah kirdaar unhen duusare sitaron se alag or upar laakar khadaa kar de
 Siddharth Malhotra played the role of a goon in the film 'ek Villon' but he was not the villain of the film
 lekin romantic film 'hansi to fansi' or ection film 'brother' flop ho gai
 In such a situation, Siddharth knows that in order to stand in front of his rivals like Varun Dhawan, something different will have to be done and perhaps that is why Siddharth is looking for a role like Shah Rukh, some funny double role film or some negative role
 siddharth malhotra ne film 'ek vilan' main gunde kii bhoomika nibhaai thi magar wo film kaa khalanaayak nahin tha
 But the romantic film 'hansi To Fansi' and the action film 'brother' flopped

 rafel maamle par congress ek baar phir centre sarkaar par hamalavar he
 The government was again attacked in Parliament by 3 senior Congress leaders - Mallikarjun Kharge, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Randeep Singh Surjewala
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne centre sarkaar kii ore se die gaye halafname par kaha ki sarkaar supreme court ko galat halafanama dekar gumraah kar rahi he, aisi sarkaar ko to barkhaast hona chahie
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said that Congress has understood how Rafael became a big scam
 is ghotaale ko chupaane ke liye modi sarkaar harsambhav koshish kar rahi he
 We allege that 5
 2 million dollar kii jo benchmark keemat thi use pradhanmantri ji ne khud badalawa diya tha, isliye hamaari maang he ki jepisi se is maamle kii jaanch karai jaae
 Mallikarjun Kharge also said that the Prime Minister and his advocates are lying
 kyon badi keemten?congresane shuukravaar ko kaha ki purv raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne rafel kii filon ko lekar kaha tha ki rafel kii keemton ke raaj filon main band he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi should tell in the House which are the secrets
 congresane kaha ki rafel kii keemton main bhrashtachar ko lekar raksha mantralay ke adhikariyon or negociation team ne sawaal uthaae the, lekin modi ne un saare aitraaj ko khaarij karte hue use koodaydaan main daal diya or desh ke paise kii lut ko hone diya gaya
 All these things are revealed in Rafael's files
 pradhanmantri modi ne rafel kii keemat 526 karod se badhaakar 1600 karod rupee kar di gai
 The government should explain why the prices were raised
 congresspravaktaa randeep singh surajevaala ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki raksha mantralay ke head of da finance sudhanshu mohanti or negociation team ke filon main aitraaj bhi darj he
 Why is PM Modi silent on that? Why was the revenue of the country deflated? Money was given first and delivery did not arrive
 itnaa hi nahin, kanoon mantralay ne bhi sawaal kiya ki na to koi bank guarantee he or na hi koi swytt guarantee
 He said that the then Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar also refused to give an opinion on the whole matter
 surajevaala kaa aarope he ki upie sarkaar saste daamon main jin rafel vimaan ko kharid rahi thi, unheen ko mahange daamon main isliye kharida kyonki isamen bahut bada ghotaalaa he
 The watchman is a thief and the revenue of the country was harmed
 JPC jaanch honi chahiecongress ke anya varisht netaaon- gulam nabi aaazaad or mallikarjun khadge ne bhi rafel deal par sawaal khadaa karte hue kaha ki congress party or congressdhyaksh rahul gandhishuru se hi yah sawaal uthaate rahe hai ki isamen bahut bada ghotaalaa he
 The entire lentil is black and should be JPC for its investigation
 taaki doodh kaa doodh pani kaa pani ho sake
 Ghulam Nabi Azad said that this is the biggest defense scam of the world and the country, in which the Prime Minister and the government are its part
 isamen kai hajaar karod kaa ghotaalaa hua he
 It is the money of the common people which is given by their tax
