 china ne 36 saal se chali aa rahi 'ek santan niti' ko alavida kah diya he or shuukravaar se aadhikarik rup se chini danpatiyon ko do bachche paidaa karne kii manjuuri mil gai he
 After this government's policy comes into effect, now the Chinese couple will be able to have two children but there are still restrictions on producing more children than this
 haalanki, pichley kai varshon se kuch sharton ke saath isamen chhot bhi di gai lekin desh kii bujurg hoti aabaadi kii vajah se dashakon puraani niti khatm karne kaa faisla liya gaya
 In China, the country's population crossed the one billion mark in the late 1970s and the government was worried about the impact it would have on the country's economy, after which Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping proposed a child policy in 1979
 Key, which was implemented
 china sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki ek santan niti se sarkaar desh main 40 karod bacchon ke janm ko niyantrit kar pai he lekin yah aankada vivaadaaspad he
 However, many social activists opposed the policy, calling it reproduction and human rights abuses
 samajashastri vipin mehta kehete hai ki china ke samaksh kai chunautiyaan thim, masalan desh kii aabaadi main bujurgon kii sankhya adhik ho rahi he, desh yuva kamgaaron kii kami se jujh rahaa he or vikaas ke shikhar par agrasar bharat main yuva brigade ko dekhte hue bhi china chintit he
 In view of the seriousness of all these challenges, a child policy has been approved to be repealed
 anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki yadi desh main yah niti jari rahati to 2050 tak china kii ek chauthai se adhik kii aabaadi kii umr 65 saal se adhik hoti
 a select few sections of China and those whose first child was a daughter were excluded from the purview of this policy
 chini maamalon ke patrkaar omshiv ne bataaya ki ek santan niti ko nirast karne kii ek vajah yah bhi he ki pichley kuch varshon se is niti ko lekar logon main rosh bana hua tha
 Many organizations and human rights activists were opposing this, saying that how a country can determine how many children its citizens can produce is a direct human rights violation
 china main bujurg aabaadi kii sankhya lagaataar bad rahi he, jiske mukaable yuvaaon kii sankhya main betahasha kami ai he
 Currently, more than 21 million people in China are over 60 years of age and this figure is set to increase in the near future

 As the number of elders increases steadily, they will have to spend a lot on their pension
 jaankaar yah bhi maanate hai ki ek santan niti samaapt karne se zyada fark nahin padane vaala, kyonki abhi bhi aise chini danpatiyon kii sankhya bahut adhik he, jo duusari santan paidaa karne ke paksh main nahin hai, kyonki isse bacchon ke laalan-paalan par padhane vaala kharch vah vahan nahin karnaa chaahate
 More than 100 million couples in the country belong to people who are not interested in giving birth to other children

 kaaran chaahe jo bhi ho, saaf he ki china ko bharat kii yuva aabaadi se chunauti mil rahi he or vah ab yah maan chukaa he ki desh main arthvyavastha kii raftaar ko banaae rakhana he to ek santan niti par pratibandh ko hataanaa padegaa
 However, it is too late in this case, but only when awake dawn
 china main 1970 ke ant main desh kii aabaadi ek arab ke aankade ko paar kar gai thi or sarkaar isse desh kii arthvyavastha par padane vaale prabhaav ko lekar chintaa main pad gai thi, jiske baad china ke netaa deng jiyaoping ne 1979 main ek santan niti prastaavit kii, jise amal main laayaa gaya
 The Chinese government believes that a child policy has allowed the government to control the birth of 400 million children in the country, but this figure is controversial
 haalanki kai saamaajik kaaryakartaaon ne is niti kaa virodh karte hue ise prajnan or maanavadhikaron kaa hanan bataaya tha
 Sociologist Vipin Mehta says that there were many challenges before China, for example, the population of the country is getting older, the country is struggling with a shortage of young workers and even after looking at the young brigade in India, which is at the peak of development
 Worried
 in sab chunautiyon kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue ek santan niti ko nirast kar do bachche paidaa karne ko manjuuri di gai he
 It is estimated that by 2050, more than a quarter of China's population would have been over 65 years of age if this policy continued in the country
 china ke kuch chuninda virgon or un logon ko is niti ke daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya tha, jinaki pehali santan beti thi
 Chinese affairs journalist Omshiv said that one of the reasons for the repeal of a child policy is that there was anger among the people for the past few years
 kai sanghathan or maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta iskaa virodh karte hue kah rahe the ki koi desh kis prakaar yah nirdhaarit kar saktaa he ki uske naagarik kitni santan paidaa karen, yah to sidhe-sidhe maanavadhikaron kaa hanan he
 The number of elderly population in China is continuously increasing, compared to which the number of youth has decreased drastically
 philhal, china main 21 karod se adhik logon kii umr 60 saal se adhik he or nikat bhavishya main yah aankada or badhane vaala he
 He is spending more on caring for the growing elderly in the country, which he cannot afford more
 bujurgon kii sankhya lagaataar badhane ke saath hi unki pension par bahutayat kharch karnaa padegaa
 Experts also believe that ending a child policy will not make much difference, as there are still a large number of Chinese couples who are not in favor of producing another child, as this would lead to reading up on children's upbringing
 Won't want to bear the expenses
 desh main das karod danpatiyon main se adhik sankhya un logon kii he, jinaki duusari santan ko janm dene main koi dilchaspee nahin he
 Professor Manik Kant of the Sociology Department of Deshbandhu College, Delhi, says that it was very important for China to take this step, as there are more number of tax paid pensioners than workers in the country
 china main bujurgon kii sankhya pichley saal 21 karod 20 lakh tak pahunch gai he
 The comments china ke rashtriya swasthya evam parivaar niyojan ayog (enechaspisi) ke pramukh lee bin ne safataur par kaha tha ki communist party of china (sipisi) kaa yah faisla desh kii bujurg ho rahi aabaadi se nipatane ke liye liya gaya he
 Whatever the reason, it is clear that China is facing a challenge from the young population of India and it has now agreed that to maintain the pace of the economy in the country, the ban on a child policy will have to be lifted
 haalanki, is maamle main bahut der ho chuki he, lekin jab jaago tabhi savera

 While BJP leader Yashwant Sinha on Tuesday called the entire proceedings of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probing the 2G spectrum allocation case as 'controversial', the Congress termed Sinha's statement as inappropriate

 The Sessions Court of Jodhpur held the first hearing on Salman's appeal on Monday in the 20-year-old black deer hunting case
 lekin seshans court main sunwaayee ke pehle hi din salmaan khan us baat se palatate najar aae, jiske aadhaar par unhen isi court ne jamaanat de di thi
 In fact, Salman Khan's lawyer Mahesh Bora has filed a petition before the sessions court on Monday, requesting Salman to be exempted from appearing personally in the next hearings
 salmaan khan ko beete 5 april ko jodhpur kii hi CJM court ne kaale hiranon ke shikaar kaa doshi qaraar dete hue 5 saal kii sajaa sunai thi
 Salman has challenged the same sentence in the sessions court
 sijeem court dwaara sajaa sunaae jane ke baad do din tak salmaan ko jodhpur central jail main gujaarni padi thi
 He was granted bail by the sessions court on April 7 after two days of dramatic events
 us samay salmaan kii jamaanat ke liye unke vakil ne is baat ko court ke saamne kaaphi purajor tareeke se uthaaya tha ki 20 saal ke cese ke dauraan salmaan kabhi bhi sunwaayee ke dauraan gaiyr-hajir nahin rahe
 Even today Salman himself reached the Jodhpur court because the sessions court while giving conditional bail to Salman had asked Salman personally to be present for today's hearing
 lekin seshans court kii sunwaayee ke pehle hi din jis tarah salmaan ne apane vakil ke jariye vyaktigat peshi se raahat maangi he, usase to yahi lagata he ki salmaan jamaanat milte hi palat gaye
 Salman's lawyer gave arguments for Bell 1
 salmaan ke vakil ne court ko bataaya- in 20 varshon main salmaan ne hameshaa court kaa sammaan kiya
 During these 20 years, Bell never jumped and was always present in court during the trial
 unhone jaanch main bhi puraa-puraa sahyog diya
 2
 vakil mahesh bora ne kaha- salmaan nirdosh hai, unhen jhuthe cese main fansaaya gaya
 After the bail, Bora said that we have got justice
 3
 Salman's lawyer gave the example of the Arms Act case related to the black deer hunting case in his plea, saying that it has not been confirmed that Salman's gun was present at the site of the incident
 unhen is cese main hoicourt dwaara bari bhi kiya ja chukaa he
 4
 vakil ne daleel di ki salmaan ko jamaanat di jaani chahie
 The denial of bail will violate their basic rights
 5
 Bora said that if Salman is not granted bail, he will have to spend some more time in jail without any reason
 mahesh bora ne sawaal bhi uthaae ki salmaan dwaara jail main bitaye gaye dinon kaa jimmedaar koun hoga? unhone salmaan dwaara kiye gaye saamaajik kaaryon kaa bhi hawala diya

 Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia has questioned the publicity of the central government's schemes of Modi government and informed that the government should explain what process was adopted for publicity and how the payment was done
 sisodiya ne centre sarkaar kii digital india, start-ap india, mek in india or narendra modi ap par sawaal uthaae hai
 Sisodia has written a letter to PM Principal Secretary Nripendra Mishra asking that 'government of India advertises on social media and Twitter, Facebook, Google, youtube to spread these schemes to the masses
 sarkaar ke is tarah ke vigyaapan dene kii prakriya ke sambandh main aapse kuch jaankaree chahta hum
 Comments sisodiya ne poocha he ki 'soshal media par vigyaapan dene ke liye kya koi biding prakriya apanaai gai thi? vigyaapan ke bhugtan kis sarkari vibhaag yaa nijee company ne kiya? narendra modi app kisne banaaya he? narendra modi par malikana haq kiskaa he? narendra modi app ke vigyaapan par kitna kharch hua?' Indeed, Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia has been accused of irregularities in Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's July 2016 program 'talk to AK' in which the CBI is investigating his role
 aarope yahi he ki is kaarykram ke prachaar ke liye ek nijee company ko bina tender theka diya gaya
 It is noteworthy that recently the audit report of the Irrigation and Flood Control Department of the Delhi Government came up, which has been audited by the Delhi Audit Department itself

 Completed in 2014 but paid for in 2016
 audit main kaha gaya he ki survey agency ko bhugtan dene main gadabadi kii sambhaavna he
 Sisodia has asked, 'was there any bidding process to advertise on social media? Which government department or private company paid for the advertisement? Who designed the Narendra Modi app? Who is the owner of Narendra Modi? How much did the Narendra Modi App cost?

 Today is the birth anniversary of Sahir, and it is necessary to remember him also because he was the poet of love
 inasaaniyat ke shaayar the
 The Hindi and Urdu world rose as a result of his poetry, the film world was also illuminated
 haalanki sahir ise sweekaarte na the
 Once he had written that he believed that he could not live up to this land, he had lost some salvation, from where we were born on March 8, 1921 in a zamindar family in Ludhiana city of Punjab, Sahir's life was spent in a lot of struggles
 lekhan ke is jaadugar kaa asli naam abdul hai fazal mohammad tha
 He did his matriculation from Khalsa School in Ludhiana
 iske baad vah lahore chale gaye, jahaan unhone apni aage kii padhai sarkari college se puri kii
 Sahir, who used to recite his shayari and songs in the ups and downs of life and recited his ghazals and nazams in college programs in the beginning, brought him much fame
 in nazmon or gazalon main sirf muhabbat ke taraane hi shaamil na the
 a rebellion was also an echo of the revolution
 zulm phir zulm he badhata he to mit jaataa haikun phir koon he tapakegaa to jam jayegakate hai ki jaani-maani punjabi lekhika amrutha preetam jab college main padhati thim, tabhi se sahir kii gajalon or najmon kii mureed ho gayin or unase pyaar karne lageen
 Amrita's first meeting with Sahir was in 1944
 vah ek mushaayare main shirkat kar rahi thim or vahiin vah sahir se milin
 It was raining on the way back, and the romanticism of that day continued to affect Amrita
 par baat aage nahin badi
 Sahir was expelled from the college shortly after
 tum mere liye ab koi ilzaam na dhundhochaha tha tumhen ek yahi ilzaam bahut haisahir ko college se nishkasit kiye jane kaa kaaran yah mana gaya ki amrutha preetam ke pita ko sahir or amrutha ke rishte par aitraaj tha kyonki sahir muslim the or amrutha sikh thi
 One reason for this was also that the financial condition of Sahir was not well in those days
 aise daur main sahir shaayad yah likh rahe the
 Their sorrow, their affection, their grievance, now where did these things also become, but Amrita did not give up her pursuit
 amrutha preetam sahir ludhiaanvi se bepanaah mohabbat karti thim
 He never hid tales of his love from Sahir
 vah sahir se apane pyaar ko akashganga kahati thim
 In her biography 'rasidi Ticket', Amrita recounts a round about how Sahir used to come to her house in Lahore and smoke cigarettes constantly
 vafaa-shiaar kai hai koi haseen bhi to hochalo phir aaj usee bewafaa kii baat karenkehate hai amrutha ko sahir kii lat lag gai thi
 But Sahir was also not untouched by this
 sahir chaahe jo bhi kahen, yah pyaar ekatarfa nahin tha
 Last year, the drama 'ek Milek', played by Shekhar Suman and Deepti Naval, based on this love of Sahir Ludhianvi and Amrita Pritam, was very much appreciated in the program of Sahitya Aaj Tak
 kehete hai, sahir kaa chale amrutha ke liye naakaabil-e-bardaasht tha
 Amrita's love had become so important to Sahir that after he left she used to collect Sahir's drank cigarette butts and felt them one after the other by attaching them to her lips
 ye wo aadat thi jisane amrutha ko cigarette kii lat laga di thi
 Not only did Amrita Pritam handle Sahir's cigarettes, but Sahir also kept his cup of tea
 har ek daur kaa mazahab nayaa khuda layakaren to ham bhi magar kis khuda kii baat karensahir 1943 main college se nishkasit kiye jane ke baad lekhan se jud gaye
 It was during this period that he wrote his first Urdu publication 'talkhiyan'
 lagbhag do varsh ke athak prayaas ke baad unki mehnat rang laayi or 'talkhiyaan' kaa prakaashan ho gaya
 The new edition of 'talkhiyan' has been re-published recently
 sahir ne progressive riters associyeshan se judakar aadabe latif, shaahakaar, or savera jaisi kai lokapriy urdu patrikaayen nikaalin, lekin savera main unke krantikari vichaar ko dekhakar pakistan sarkaar ne unke khilaaf giraftaar kaa warrant jari kar diya
 He moved to Delhi from Lahore and after spending some time here Sahir moved to Mumbai in the year 1950
 wo afsaana jise anjaam tak laana na ho mumkinuse ek kuubasurat mode de kar chhodana achchhasahir ne 1950 main pradarshit ‘aazaadee kii raah par’ film main apana pehla geet ‘badal rahi he jindagi’ likhaa lekin film safal nahin rahi
 In 1951, to the tune of SD Burman, he wrote 'cold Winds, Lehra Ke Aaye Tum Rut Hai Jawaan Kya Bulaye' for the film 'naujawan', and then became a lyricist
 sahir ne khayyam ke sangeet nirdesan main kai superhit geet likhe
 It is said that in the year 1958, for the film 'phir Morni Hogi', actor Raj Kapoor wanted his favorite composer Shankar Jaikishan to perform music, but Sahir pressed for Khayyam and when Khayyam did songs like 'woh Morni Kabhi To Aayegi' It was proved that Sahir was right
 gurudutt kii 'pyaasa' ke liye likhe geet likhe se sahir ko alag bulandi mili

 baad main darshakon kii maang par is gane ko teen baar or dikhaaya gaya
 This was the first and last event of its kind in the history of the film industry
 unhone 'sadhana', 'baaji' or 'phir subah hogi' jaisi filmon ke liye bhi geet likhe
 Once a filmmaker asked Naushad to compose lyrics to him and Sahir came to know that the composer Naushad was being paid more remuneration, he asked the producer to terminate the contract
 unka kahana tha ki naushaad ek mahaan sangeetkaar ho sakate hai lekin kisi bhi dhun ko shabd hi vajani banaate hai
 So the lyricist should get more remuneration from the musician, even if it is more than one rupee
 sahir ludhiaanvi apane sine kariyar main do baar sarvshereshth geetkaar ke filmphere puraskaar se sammanit kiye gaye

 This was strongly opposed by Sahir Ludhianvi, after which singers and musicians as well as lyricists were named in songs broadcast on the radio

 bataa den ki udaipur main shanivaar ko hi rahul ne bhi modi par bada atake karte hue kaha kipiemahindutv kii baat karte hai, lekin hindutv ke bare main nahin jaanate
 Also, Rahul Gandhi tweeted that Modi was the master of manipulation
 rahul kii is tippanee par sushamaa swaraj ne aage kaha ki congress ko laga ki keval hindu kehane se nahin hoga to aasthavan hindu banane kii koshish hui
 If this did not work, then Nana's caste started being described as Brahmin
 sushamaa ke mutabik, rahul gandhi ne kaha ki piem hindu hone kaa matlab nahin jaanate
 He said this because he and the Congress are confused about their religion and caste
 lambey vakt se party unhen dharm nirpeksh netaa ke taur par pesh kar rahi he, lekin chunaav aate hi unhen ye ahsaas hua ki hindu bahusankhyak hai, to unhone ye chhavi banaai
 The Foreign Minister said that statements have come out that he is a Janeudhari Brahmin
 lekin mujhe nahin maaloom tha ki janeudhari brahman ke gyaan main itani vruddhi ho gai ki hindu hone kaa matlab ab hamen unase samajhnaa padegaa
 God forbid that the day ever comes that we should know from Rahul Gandhi what it means to be a Hindu
 congress duvidhapurna sthiti main he ki karen kya
 Religion can change, but caste cannot change

 Therefore, i am not contesting the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki unhone kaha ki main chunaav nahin lard raheen, lekin raajnneeti nahin chhod rahi hum
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said - Rahul is a political politician, senior BJP leader and Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Rahul Gandhi's problem is that he is in confusion
 ve patibaddh hone kii bajaay apane siyaasi phaayde ke liye hindu hone ke dikhaave main badlaav karte rahete hai
 He is a Hindu in political terms
 unke hindu aasthaa siaayan phaayde ke saath badalati rahati he

 Amidst the criticism being received by the government's recent decision on direct foreign investment (FDI) in the retail sector, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that we have taken the decision regarding FDI not in a hurry but in a thoughtful manner and we are confident that this decision of the country Is in interest pradhanmantri ne bhartiya yuva congress ke do divasiy adhiveshan ke samaapan satr ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki sarkaar ne khudara kshetra main videshi pratyash nivesh ke sambandh main jo nirnay kiya he vah kisi jaldbaaji main nahin balki bahut sochsamajhakar kiya gaya he
 We firmly believe that this decision is in the interest of our country
 unhone kaha ki hamaara maananaa he ki khudara kshetra main epadiai aane se aadhunik praudyogiki bharat main aegi, krishi utpaadon kii barbaadi kam hogi or hamaare kisaan bhaaiyon ko unki fasal ke behatar daam milenge

 Singh said, "state governments which do not see any benefit in doing so have measures to stop FDI in retail trade in their state
" hamaara maananaa he ki khudara main epadiai kii vajah se khaadya prasanskaran, parivahan or bhandaaran jaise kshetron main rojgaar ke tamaam naye maukey paidaa honge

 ’ When the Anti Corruption Bureau team raided a white marble plinth in Noida's Sector 47, adjacent to Delhi, everyone was surprised to see the view inside that kothi
 behtareen tareeke se dizin kii gai us kothi main karine se baag-bageeche bhi sajaae gaye the
 Seeing the Kothi, there was a feeling of the palace of a king Maharaja
 yah kothi he ritred dspi harshavardhan bhadauria kii, jo sampatti ke maamle main noida kaa doosraa yadav singh niklaa
 In Red, it was revealed that apart from this luxurious marble kothi, there are many such rooms which have a strong retired DSP Bhadoria
 ritred dspi kaa kaala chittha dhire dhire saamne aa rahaa he
 Harsh Vardhan Bhadoria's name is very popular in Noida and Greater Noida
 yogi sarkaar ke aate hi bhadauria ne walentary ritairement kii arji daakhil kii or jald hi bhadauria ko viares mil bhi gaya
 The question arose as to why Bhadoria took retirement just 4 months before retirement
 to iskaa jawaab ye he ki yogi sarkaar ke aate hi uski kaali kamai kii pole khulne kaa dar tha
 The anti-corruption Bureau has filed a lawsuit against retired DSP Harsh Vardhan Bhadoria, who was posted in Noida Authority and always in controversy
 anti karpshan beuro ne yah mukadmaa aay se adhik sampatti arjeet karne ke maamle main darj karaayaa he
 There were a lot of complaints against Harshvardhan Bhadoria, who was very close to the SP government at the time of deployment
 lekin siyaasi rasookh ke chalate bhadauria kaa koi bal bhi baankaa nahin kar paata tha
 An investigation was initiated when the bureau received a complaint regarding the disproportionate assets
 jaanch main chaunkaane vaala khulaasa hua ki bhadauria ne apni aay se 1178 fisadi zyada sampatti arjeet kii he
 Anti Corruption investigated Bhadoria's properties for almost 2 years and after that filed a case at Sector 49 police station in Noida
 anti karpshan beuro ke mutabik 2003 se 2017 tak harshavardhan bhadauria ke jariye arjeet kii gai aay kii jaanch kii gai to usamen paaya gaya ki bhadauria ne apni selary se kareeb 8 lakh rupee arjeet kiye, vahiin isi dauraan usne 10 karod rupee kharch kiye
 It is clear that Harshvardhan Bhadoria has acquired 1178% more wealth than his income
 karodpati ritred dspi harshavardhan bhadauria kii sampattiyon kii jaanch anti karpshan beuro sahi tareeke se nahin kar paaya
 Hence, help has been sought from Noida Police for further investigation
 1981 main harshavardhan bhadauria bataur sab inspector upi police main bhartee hua tha
 Bhadoria is a resident of Etawah district of Uttar Pradesh
 apane siyaasi rasookh ke dam par usne sab-inspector rahete hue karodon kii kamai kar lee thi
 Sources reveal that Bhadoria's lottery started when he got a posting in the Noida Authority during the SP government
 haalat to ye ho gai thi ki othority main uski lagaataar tainaati ke liye baqayda dspi kaa ek nayaa pad bhi srujit kiya gaya tha
 During the deployment at the Noida Authority, the price of crores of 47 in Noida, 2-2 school in the name of his son in the luxurious house, Sector 57, was erected by Bhadoria
 noida ke sector 75 main uskaa ek skool niyam kanoon ko taak par rakhkar banaaya gaya
 The monarchical living of Bhadoria can be gauged from the fact that he had made a new way to reach his luxurious house in Sector 47 of Noida
 jis par sirf use chalane kaa haq tha
 Illegal construction has been done on the green belt to reach his house
 ghar ke paas green belt par rasta or ghar ke baahar guardroom or apane gurgon ke liye nirmaan karaayaa
 Bhadoria has also built a stylist thatched hut for the VVIP people visiting her house
 sutron kaa kahana he ki bhadauria kii sampatti itani he ki is maamle kii jaanch noida police ke bas kii baat nahin
 For this, CBI or Income Tax Department will have to come forward
 baharhaal, abhi jaanch noida police ke paas he
 Despite registering an FIR, no inquiries have been made from Bhadauria till now
 sutron kii maane to bhrashtachar kaa yah maamla noida ke giraftaar ejeeniyar yadav singh se bhi bada nikalegaa
 Allegations of phone tapping during the election campaign on former President Barack Obama's administration have been dismissed by US President Donald Trump

 So far it has been known that there is no phone tapping
 gauratlab he ki fox news ko diye gaye ek intervyuu main donald trump ne kaha tha ki phone tanping ke maamle main kai chije saamne ai hai, agle do hafton main or bhi baaten saamne aaengi

 swarg kii alakapuri naamak nagari main kuber naam kaa raja tha
 He was a devotee of Shiva
 hem naam kaa mali pujan ke liye uske yahaan phool laata tha
 Hem had a beautiful woman named Vishalakshi
 ek din vah maansarovar se pushp to le aayaa lekin kamaskt hone ke kaaran vah apni stri se hasya-vinod tathaa raman karne laga
 Seeing the delay in worship, King Kubera sent servants to know the reason for not coming to the gardener
 tab sevakon ne puri baat aakar raja ko sach-sach bataa di
 Hearing this, Kubera became very angry and cursed the gardener that you will bear the disconnection of the woman and go to the dead land (earth) and become a leper
 kuber ke shraap se hem mali kaa swarg se patan ho gaya or vah usee kshan prithvi par gir gaya
 As soon as he came to the ground, his body got leprosy
 uski stri bhi usee samay gaayab ho gai
 Hem Mali had been suffering for a long time in the land of death, but he had knowledge of the memory of his previous birth
 ek din vah markendeya rishi ke ashram main pahunch gaya
 On seeing him, Markandeya Rishi said - what kind of sin you have committed, due to which this condition of yours has happened
 hem mali ne puri baat unhen bataa di
 Hearing his agony, the sage asked him to observe Yogini Ekadashi
 hem mali ne vidhipurvak yogini ekadshi kaa vrath kiya
 Due to the effect of this fast, he came to his old form and started living happily with his woman

 Manmohan Singh and Wen will meet on the sidelines of ASEAN and East Asia conferences, which will discuss bilateral relations on a wider scale
 ye sambandh pratispardhaa or sahyog ke liye khaas myne rakhte hai
 Prior to the meeting, official sources said that these relations need to be maintained with caution
 sutron ne kaha ki yah duniya ke sarvaadhik jatil rishton main se hai or abhi yah anumaan lagaana mushkil he ki inkaa rup aage kya hoga
 These comments hold significance in view of the debate between India and China over the exploitation of the resources of the South China Sea

 India responded sharply to this
 iske baad china kii nausena ne us ilaake main kadam rakhane par bhartiya nausena ke jahaaj ienes airavat ko chetavanee di thi
 Indian sources emphasized that since it is not clear that the area is entirely of China, the rules of the sea will apply there
 unhone kaha ki us ilaake main aane vaale deshon ne china ke saath vyapaar karne ke liye dwipaksheeya taur par aachaar samhita banaai he kyonki china ke daawey ke sambandh main ‘lagaataar parivartan’ hota rahaa he
 Pointing out that india-china relations are complex, sources said that it has elements of both 'competition and cooperation'
 jahaan ek taraf donon deshon ke bich seemaa vivaad lagaataar ansulajhaa bana hua he, vahiin vyapaar samet kai duusare kshetron main donon deshon ke bich sambandhon main lagaataar majbootee ai he
 Sources said the bilateral trade between India and China crossed $ 61 billion last year and has grown by 17 per cent in seven months of this financial year, but the 'big issue' of imbalance in favor of China is now Remains in its place
 sutron ne is baat par bhi jor diya ki haalanki vaastavik niyantran rekha pichley lagbhag chaar dashakon se shant bani hui he or pichley kuch saalon main china kii ore se ghuspaith main bhi kami ai he, par isaki sainya kshamtaaon main ijapha hua he
 However, he did not provide any data on this
 sutron ne kaha ki china yaa bharat, donon kii ore se ghuspaith ke bare main pehle se ashanka vyakt kii ja sakati he kyonki donon paksh jaanate hai ki yah kahaan se ho sakati he, par sainya taur par aamanaa-saamana nahin hota
 This infiltration is usually symbolic and both sides often leave their marks, such as writing on cigarette packets or stones, in order to stake their claim to that area
 donon desh is saal ke ant tak seemaa prabandhan kii ek takanic viksit karenge, jiskaa uddeshy galatchhemiyon ko dur karnaa he
 Wen gave the idea of developing this technology during his visit to India last year
 isse jude vishesh pratinidhiyon kii is maheene ke ant main mulaakaat hogi
 These representatives have made substantial progress in their negotiations towards resolving the border dispute
 iskaa vivaran dete hue sutron ne bataaya ki vaarta ke teen charan hai
 The first stage is the Guiding Principles and the Political Parameters
 doosraa charan seemaa vivaad ke samaadhaan ke liye buniyadi khaake kii pahchaan or teesraa charan ise lagu karne kaa he
 Sources said that the second and third phases are the 'most difficult' part of this conversation and efforts are being made to complete these phases
 unhone kaha ki kisi bhi paksh ne in charnon ko puraa karne ke liye koi samaysima nirdhaarit nahin kii he
 Sources also stressed the need to 'manage' these relationships, although they acknowledged that it is very 'difficult' to express any possibility about it
 sutron ne is baat par bhi jor diya ki china ke saath pratispardhaa main darane kii koi jarurat nahin he kyonki bharat ke bazaar iskaa muqabla karne main sakasham hai

 But Chandan brought anonymous talents
 ve kahati hai, log amuman ramjiyavan das babala, mamaji baxur, snehalata ke geet bahut gaate hai, lekin unke naam aage nahin aa pate
 For example, the song Baba Baijnath Hum Ayeli Duariya is very popular but this song is of affection, very few people knew it
 chandan sirf yaheen nahin rukeen
 He has lent over 200 songs from 60 creators and artists such as Rasool Mian, Kailash Gautam, Shivprasad Kiran, Murari Sharan, Musa Kalim, Sundar Vorsha, Snehlata, Moti Baa

 Chandan turned down an invitation to a Bangkok event because there were people singing songs of a woman's body on that stage
 vahiin, unhone morishas ke ek samaaroh par ranchi main anaath bacchon ke bich kaarykram ko tarjeeh di
 Chandan has destroyed many traditions
 bhojpuri main amuman nayak or gayak dikhte hai par pita harishankar tiwari ke ritairement ke baad parivaar aarthik boj se dab gaya tha
 Mother Rekha Tiwari has been behind him like a rock in every difficulty
 in dushwariyon se nikalakar chandan ne sitaron se staradam ko chunauti dekar apni pahchaan banaai he
 And now Chandan is searching for folklore on Lord Buddha with Biharnama and the eyes of the people who once called him nachania-bazania have been dazzled by his brightness

 com / s93wvhnqc6 The Delhi government called a special session of the assembly on Tuesday, where Aam Aadmi Party MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj showed a live demo of live tempering of an EVM type machine
 is dauraan saurabh ne daawa kiya ki 'ek sikret code ke zarie hoti he EVM se chhedchhad sambhav he
 The code is secretly inserted during voting
 code daalane ke baad har vot ek khaas party ko jaataa he
 The mother board of the EVM can be tampered with by changing
 koi aisi mashin nahin, jiske saath chhedchhad na kii ja sake
 This tempering is not easy to catch
 maine ellection kamishan kii website ko pard or unke jawaab padhe
 How to press any button on the machine inside the Bhind slip was coming out of BJP
 chunaav ayog ne isaki jaanch kii, lekin unki report kaa koi sir-pair nahin he'
 Earlier Arvind Kejriwal claimed that today the country will know the truth of the big conspiracy in the House
 @3
 38- There is no such machine in the world that cannot be tampered with
 jidhar se ham ye iviem kii takanic laae hai wo bhi inke jariye chunaav nahin karvaa rahe, kyonki ve jaanate hai ki inke saath chhedchhad sambhav he : saurabh @ 3
 35- pitaaji kehete the ki teri ejineering kaa kya phayda khulwaane to siver hi hai, lekin aaj main iskaa istemaal kar paa rahaa hum
 @ 3
 34 saurabh ne kaha- main tumhaare kaaran hi ejineering chhodkar raajnneeti main aayaa tha, aaj main phir ejineering kaa istemaal kar rahaa hum
 @ 3
 32 saurabh ne kaha- maine bi-tech kiya he
 i gave 10 years to big companies
 main chalange karata hum ki koi bhi scientist ye sabit kar de ki aisa kyon ho rahaa tha
 Why press any button was going to BJP
 @3
 18- Saurabh Bhardwaj showed how EVM is tempered through evm-like machine
 unhone bataaya ki jis bhi party ko jitvaana hota he, uskaa ek code hota he
 The same is used

 If questions have been raised on evms, then investigation should be done
 nai iviem hote hue bhi emsidi chunaav puraani iviem se hue
 evms were sourced from Rajasthan despite having adequate evms in Delhi
 ham iviem main chhedchhad se judaa saboot pesh karenge

 BJP is adamant on stopping the work which has been rejected by Speaker Ramnivas Goyal

 He has written that Saurabh Bhardwaj will present before the country the truth of a very big conspiracy going on in the country

 - Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) May 9, 2017 It is noteworthy that Kapil Mishra has accused Arvind Kejriwal of taking bribe of 2 crores
 shanivaar ko mantrimandal se nikaale jane ke baad kapil mishra ne ravivaar ko arvind kejariwal par gambhir aarope lagaae
 Mishra said that he has seen Kejriwal taking 2 crore rupees from Satyendra Jain before his eyes
 unhone iske khilaaf awaz uthaai to unhen mantrimandal se nikaal diya or party se nilambit kar diya he, haalanki aam aadmi party ke baaki netaa in aaropon ko bebuniyaad bataa rahe hai
 Sanjay Singh said that Kapil Mishra is actually part of the conspiracy against AAP
 unke madhyam se aap ko pareshaan karne kaa khel chal rahaa he
 Kapil Mishra is making such allegations in the fear of going to the ministerial position

 But this could not happen
 virendra sahvaag ne bhi srilanka ke khilaadiyon par mask lagaakar khilne ko lekar tanj ksaa tha
