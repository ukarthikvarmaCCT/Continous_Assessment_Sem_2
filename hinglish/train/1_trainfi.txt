 desh ke 5 rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaav ko 2019 ke semifinal ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha
 The results of these states were also political storm
 khaskar bijepi kii satta vaale teen rajyon rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh ke nattejey to 2019 ke chunaav se pehle bijepi ke liye khatre kii ghanti bajaate dikh rahe hai
 On 13 September 2013, BJP announced the appointment of Gujarat CM Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad bijepi dhuandhar rashtravyapee prachaar abhiyaan main jute gai
 Elections in four states were held in December 2013, after Modi Lahar Mododi's announcement of making him the political face of BJP started by winning 3 states
 jinamein se teen rajyon rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main bijepi prachand bahumat ke saath satta main ai jabaki dilli main achche pradarshan ke baavjood sarkaar nahin bana pai
 In 2015 elections again took place in Delhi and out of 70 seats, the Aam Aadmi Party got 67 seats
 dilli kaa janadesh bijepi or congress donon ke khilaaf chalaa gaya
 The Congress could not even open an account in Delhi elections
 lekin teen rajyon kii jeet kaa phayda bijepi ko mila
 After this there was discussion of Modi wave in political corridors
 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav jitkar prachand bahumat ke saath bijepi satta main ai or 30 saal main pehali baar kisi party ne apane boote centre main sarkaar banaai
 Then, one by one, governments of BJP and allies were formed in 21 states
 is jeet kaa puraa shrey modi magic ko diya gaya
 The Congress lost and kept growing
 Let us tell Modi that in the last Lok Sabha election there was a strong anti-incumbency wave against the UPA government led by Manmohan Singh
 2ji spectrum, koyala block aavanton or rashtramandal khel sahit kai ghotaalon ke chalate logon ne manmohan singh ke khilaaf vot kiya or narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi ko spasht bahumat dekar desh kii satta saunpi thi
 In the states of the country, where the mandate went against the ruling party, till the dream of Congress-free India from the Modi wave, the Congress was in power in most of the states
 aise main kai rajyon main grand old party ko satta virdohi lahar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Due to this, the Congress had to lose power in many states
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad maharashtra, haryana, assam, andhra pradesh, jharkhand, uttarakhand or himachal pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav hue
 All these states had Congress governments and had to face anti-incumbency
 karnataka chunaav main bhi yahi hua, haalanki jedies ke saath milakar congress ne sarkaar bana lee

 After the announcement of candidates in the Samajwadi Party on Wednesday, it became clear that Shivpal Yadav is very heavy on his nephew and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav in the matter of tickets
 shivpal yadav ke kareebi logon ko tikat mil gaya, jabaki akhilesh yadav ke chaheton kaa patta saaf ho gaya
 It is being said that the war between the uncle and nephew regarding the ticket distribution in Samajwadi Party can start Part-2
 tikat bantwaare par machi khinchataan ke bare main 'aaj tak' ne shivpal yadav se khaas baatcheet kii
 When asked about his position in ticket distribution, Shivpal Yadav's reply was that all the tickets given have been given by the wishes of Mulayam Singh Yadav and all have their consent
 akhilesh yadav kii list ke bare menshivpalka kahana he ki sirf mukhyamantri ne hi nahin, tamaam or logon ne bhi party adhyaksh mulaayam singh ko apni apni list saunpi he
 Mulayam Singh listens to everyone, but his decision is final and no one in the Samajwadi Party can question it
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki atik ahamed jaise aparaadhiyon ko tikat dene ko lekar akhilesh naaraaz hai
 But when asked, Shivpal Yadav clearly said that his objective is to get tickets to the winning people and to form the Samajwadi Party government again
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kya iske liye aparaadhiyon kaa saath lenaa thik he, to shivpal yadav kaa jawaab tha ki iske liye sabhi partiyon ko milakar baat kerani padegi
 At the same time, they also add that the socialist party does not encourage criminals
 sabaki nigahen ab is baat par lageen hai ki apane logon ko tikat nahin dilaa paane ke baad akhilesh yadav kya karte hai
 Will his supporters fight the rebels? When asked, Shivpal says that there is no bigger than party and organization and those who have left the party have seen what happens
 unka maananaa he ki jo sachcha samaajawaadee hoga wo aisa kabhi nahin karegaa
 Mulayam Singh Yadav again said on Wednesday that the Samajwadi Party alliance will not be with anyone
 lekin shivpal is bare main puche jane par kehete hai ki gathbandhan agar thik se nahin ho paae to baat banane ke bajaay bigad jaati he
 Therefore, his party has been reluctant from the alliance
 duusari vajah ye he ki abhi tak congress party ke kisi jimmedaar netaa ne naa to unase baat kii he or naa hi mulaayam singh yadav se

 (input bhashaa se) The results of the Lok Sabha elections 2019 will come on May 23, but according to all the exit polls that came before it, the NDA government at the Center seems to be forming
 jabaki congress netritv vaali upie puri tarah se fail najar aa rahi he
 Not only this, in order to stop Modi's victory chariot in Uttar Pradesh, the SP-BSP alliance, which has forgotten the age-old rivalry, is said to get very few seats
 aise main mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke gathbandhan ke bhavishya ko lekar atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki ye gathbandhan aage bhi jari rahegaa yaa phir nahin
 Results of exit poll According to ajat-axis My India exit poll, out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP, the BJP alliance is seen getting 62-68 seats
 jabaki sapa-basapa-areldi gathbandhan ko 10 se 16 siten or congress ko 1 se do siten milane kaa anumaan he
 BJP alone can get 60 to 66 seats and Apna Dal can get 2 seats
 jabaki sapa ko 4 se 7 or basapa ko 3 se 7 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 At the same time, the Congress is expected to get one to two seats
 uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko donon dalon ke netaaon ne aitihaasik kadam bataaya tha
 In such a situation, it was believed that Mayawati and Akhilesh were going to do big damage to the BJP
 lekin ajtak-exis maai india agsit pole sahit tamaam survey ke mutabik gathbandhan puri tarah se fail hota dikh rahaa he
 In this exit poll, the NDA has been shown close to the previous election results
 jab rahul- akhilesh kaa chuta sathsube main 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad rahul or akhilesh ke gathbandhan kaa jo hashr hua he vah sabake saamne he
 After the Lok Sabha election results this time, there is speculation that Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati's alliance will happen
 haalanki akhilesh yadav pehle hi kah chuke hai ki yah gathbandhan sirf loksabhaa chunaav nahin balki aage bhi jari rahegaa
 He had said the same thing for the Congress in the 2017 assembly elections, but he did not make the Congress a part of the coalition when the Lok Sabha elections were held after two years
 kya aage bhi jari rahegaa sapa-basapa gathbandhan ?loksabhaa chunaav ke baad bhi agar sapa-basapa saath rahakar aage chunaav ladate hai to isse ek baat saaf ho jaaegi ki donon partiyon ne maan liya he ki bijepi ko akele nahin haraaya ja saktaa
 Not only this, they also have to make their political equation in a new way
 iske jahaan phaayde hai to vahiin nuksaan kaa bhi saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 It will be a big challenge for the SP-BSP to keep its cadre together
 iske alaava kaaryakartaaon ke manobal ko bhi barkaraar rakhana ek chalange hoga
 According to exit poll results, the SP and BSP contested this election did not succeed
 haalanki kal jab voton kii ginati hogi or gathbandhan bijepi ko nuksaan pahunchane main kaamyaab hua to yah gathbandhan khatm hone vaala nahin lagata he

 He asked world leaders to fight terrorism together
 piem ne kaha, ‘aatankwaad or charampanth se ladanaa duniya main netritv kaa sabase sateek pareekshan he'

 Rajiv Gandhi is also relevant in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pehle to unako bhrashtachari number ek bataakar tikhaa hamalaa bolaa hi tha par lagata he modi ke tir abhi khatm nahin hue hai
 Now, in his speech at Ramlila Maidan in New Delhi on 8 May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that Rajiv Gandhi used the aircraft carrier INS Virat to picnic his family and friends
 aaie ham is daawey (yaa aarope) kii asaliyat kii padtaal karte hai
 In fact, in December 1987, Rajiv Gandhi went to Bangaram island in Lakshadweep with 36 islands and a population of 44 thousand
 jo aadhe varg kilometre ke kshetrafal vaali nirjan jagah thi
 This island is strategically very important and it is the only island in Lakshadweep where foreigners are allowed to go
 or yahaan nashaabandi bhi nahin he
 The report of Rajiv Gandhi's visit to the island was printed with detailed photographs in the India Today issue of 31 January 1988
 lakshadweep pahunch gayiindia tudeki patrkaar anitha pratap ne likhaa he ki haalanki rajeev ke daure ke samay kisi bahari aadmi ko pahunchane dene ke sabhi sambhav prayaas kiye gaye the par patrkaar log pahunch hi gaye
 In fact, it became a center of attraction for the media when on December 26, 1987, Rahul Gandhi and his four friends landed in an orange and white helicopter
 uske baad to daston ko silsilaa ban gaya
 The government machinery put great emphasis in keeping journalists away from here
 tapu par aade vaale logon main rahul or priyanka ke chaar dost, sonia gandhi kii bahan, jija or unki beti, sonia kii vidhwaa mata aar
 There were also Mayano and brother and maternal uncle
 iske alaava amitabh bachchan, jaya bachchan, or unke bachche (shweta or abhishek) bhi the
 There was also the daughter of Ajitabh (amitabh's brother)
 baaki mehmaano main sirf do hindustani the, arun singh ke bhai bijendra singh or unki patni
 All the others were foreigners
 rajeev or sonia 30 disambar kii dopaher main pahunche
 But the helicopter which came on a special cochin-kavaratti flight with Amitabh Bachchan arrived on the 31st
 shaayad, iskaa lakshya amitabh kii vahaan maujuudagi par paradaa daale rakhana tha
 But the distinction was exposed as the chopper had to stop for 50 minutes to get fuel on the Kavaratti island before reaching Bangaram and then returning from there, the Indian Express photographer at the Cochin Airport saw him and gave Amitabh's angry warnings
 Despite this, he took four photos
 haalanki us tapu par ek hafte kii chuttee main partiyon kaa daur chalaa
 Anita Pratap writes in India Today, it is difficult to estimate how much the total would have cost on this pageant at the end of the year
 kyonki kai agenciyon ne apni-apni tarah se is par kharch uthaaya
 For example, food was spent by the sports development organization of entertainment, tourism and water sports
 is maukey ke liye agatti main 100 murge murgiyon kaa khaas form lagaaya gaya tha
 But the real thing is that the country's flagship warship IAS Virat was used to ride Rajiv Gandhi's family and during this time it roamed the Arabian Sea for 10 days
 anitha likhti he, is yudhpot par hone vaala kharch behisaab he kyonki yah jahaan bhi jaataa he iske saath suraksha poton kaa puraa kafila chalata he
 It was reported that a submarine was also stationed there for this purpose
 iske alaava agatti main vishesh upgrah sanchaar sampark vyavastha bhi kii gai thi
 When this picnic ended on 6 January, Priyanka and her companions left for Goa first
 unke baad videshi bujurg log ravaanaa hue or phir amitabh or unka parivaar
 1 on the same day
 20 baje rajeev ne rahul ke saath helicopter main prasthaan kiya
 Before attending his first program in Amino in 1988, Rajiv landed Rahul on the IAS Virat to travel with him to Mangalore later
 baharhaal, yah baat to tay he ki rajeev gandhi ne apane nijee saiyr-sapate ke liye desh ke ek vimaanvaahi pot kaa istemaal kiya tha or uske saath puure yudhak bede ko uljhaae rakhaa
 a submarine was also on duty together, but perhaps Prime Minister Modi might have forgotten to mention it
 *** There is an encounter between miscreants and police in Ghaziabad near Delhi
 skuti par ja rahe badmaashon ko thana sihani get ilaake main police ne roka to unhone firing shuru kar di
 The police also fired back in pursuit, in which one crook was caught, the other escaped
 police ne skuti, ek pistal or ek tamancha baraamad kiya he
 The injured crook has been identified as Mursalin
 vah loni main D-50 naamak registerd gang kaa sadsy he
 These miscreants attempted robbery with a man passing through the path of Kashiram residential scheme of Vijayanagar
 soochna milte hi police ne badmaashon ko gher liya
 Police encounter took place in Lohia Nagar of Sihani Gate Police Station area
 isamen ek badmaash or ek pulicekarmi ko goli lagi he
 Both have been admitted to the hospital
 police ab badmaash ke duusare saathi kii talash main juty he
 The encounter took place in Lohia Nagar, a posh area of the Sihani Gate Police Station area
 badmaash police par goli chalane se gurej nahin kar rahe, lekin police ne bhi thaan rakhaa he ki goli hi inkaa asli ilaaj he
 Let us tell you that in Uttar Pradesh, there has been an attack of miscreants
 aparaadhiyon ko lekar upi police ection main he
 Acting in the mode of Operation 'allout', UP Police conducted 24 encounters in 72 hours a few days ago, in which 36 notorious criminals were brought behind bars, while 3 prize crooks were killed
 bataaya gaya ki 3 din ke andar upi ke 15 jilon main police or badmaashon ke bich jabardast muthabheden huin, jisamen sabase zyada chaar encounter shamali main, tinencounterbulandshahr main, jabaki kanpur, mujffarnar, saharanpur or rajdhani lakhanu main do-do encounter hue
 During encounters, large quantities of weapons were also recovered from the miscreants
 aatank kaa paryaay ban chuke baavariyaa gang ke 4 dakaiton ko giraftaar kiya gaya, jabaki duusare main do dakaiton ko goli lagi he
 Both of them are dacoits belonging to the Bavaria gang
 police ne tadatad hue in encounters main jin badmaashon kaa kaam tamaam kiya he, un par 10 hajaar se 50 hajaar tak kaa inaam ghoshit tha or kai sansanikhej cese darj the
 While the Narendra Modi government, standing at the last stage of its tenure, is sitting around from the common man to the small and big industries, the Indian film industry, which is going through challenges, has also kept the pack of expectations
 film industry kii kuch maangen lambey vakt se lambit hai
 However, the news of getting many concessions also came after industry leaders at the top of the power spoke directly to Prime Minister Modi
 modi sarkaar ne haal hi main film udyog ke liye jiesti ko lekar badi raahat di
 But the industry's title of expectations is still "dil Maange More"
 july 2017 main deshbhar main jiesti lagu hone ke baad film industry ke liye 100 rupee se upar ke sabhi tikats ko sarvaadhik 28 fisadi ke tex praavdhaan se bada dhakka laga
 The industry was already grappling with demand in the digital era, and the increase in tax made it extremely difficult to pull viewers to the cinema hall
 dekha gaya ki bhartiya manoranjan udyog ke liye behad mahatvapurn rajya tamilnadu main jiesti ke alaava sabhi gaiyr-tamil filmon ke tikat par 'local body antertenment tex' ke naam par 48 fisadi zyada tex vasuulana shuru kar diya gaya
 The government has accepted the demand for reduction in GST on cinemas ticket rates
 haal ke dinon main pradhanmantri modi kai martabaa film nirmaataa or abhinaytaon se mulaakaat kar chuke hai
 During the inauguration of the Museum of Indian Cinema in Mumbai, Modi also spoke to a number of celebrities associated with filmmaking
 in mulakaaton main bijepi kii raajnneetik laabh haani ko bhi dekha gaya
 Regarding the exercise, a faction also believed that this is an attempt to garner votes using the role of stars, especially in the coming elections
 udhar, industry bhi satta ke galiyaaron tak pahunch banaakar apana hit saadhane kii koshish karti dikh rahi he
 Many of his problems are also valid from a commercial perspective
 cinema jagat kii dikkatenis sabake baavjood film nirmaan main jiesti ke baad badi laagat ek ahm mudda he
 GST has had an impact on each side of film production
 hotel booking, yatayaat, sansaadhan, lokations, shooting ritis jaisi adhikansh sevaayen ab film mekking ko mahangaa kar rahaa he
 Hence, the filmmakers demand that the government implement the provision of the National IPR Policy made in 2016 at the earliest, keeping in mind the film production
 haalanki film jagat ko industry kaa darja pehle mil chukaa he ab use ej of duing bijness ke praavdhaanon se raahat kii ummid he
 The film industry demands that on the lines of any other business, film clearance, broadcasting permissions for film industry and single window clearance for shooting and screen building should be provided

 film industry ko centre sarkaar se aas he ki vah anti piresi kanoon ko or majboot kare iske saath hi internet or mobile industry bhi film industry ke is paksh par saath kaam kare
 Significantly, the film industry in the country faces a big challenge of piracy and in this era of internet and mobile, the film reaches the audience through these mediums before its release

 Also, in the direction of increasing demand, the industry is once again demanding that the Central Government should give relief to theaters in the year 2000

 The industry believes that now that there is a big improvement in basic facilities like electricity, roads etc
 in the country, it should make a provision for relief for the construction of multiplexes and theaters

 aapako jaanakar shaayad hairat ho ki uttar pradesh main akhilesh yadav sarkaar ke do saal ke kaarykaal main mahaj 4 dange hue
 State Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav made this claim in the House
 dilachasp baat yah he ki isse pehle sarkaar kii ore se hi dedh saal ke kaarykaal main 27 dangon kaa aankada jari kiya gaya tha
 In fact, the matter caught up when the BJP questioned the government during the assembly proceedings and sought the accounts of the communal riots in the state till now
 sarkaar ne jawaab main bataaya ki ab tak sapa sarkaar banane ke baad pradesh main kul 4 sampradayik dange hue jinamein 56 logon kii maut hui or kareeb 136 log gambhir rup se ghayal hue
 Following this response from the government, the main opposition Bahujan Samaj Party started a fierce uproar within the House
 bispi netaa swami prasad maury ne kaha, '27 dangon vaala jawaab sahi he yaa 4 dangon vaala? ibi kii report ke mutabik 115 dangon kaa aankada sahi he to swaabhaavik rup se samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar apane ko bachaane kaa paap kar rahi he
 At the same time, BJP alleged that those who spoil communal harmony enjoyed the protection of the government, so the government did not give a clear answer
 sampradayik dangon ke jawaab par congress ne bhi aapatti jataai
 The Congress said that this SP government has accepted 27 communal riots in the same house in the first year and now four riots are being told and the government of Uttar Pradesh is misleading the people
 sadan main vipaksh ke aakraamak tevar jhel chuki samaajawaadee party ab sampradayik dangon ke sawaal par bachati najar aa rahi he
 The party claims that the answer is given only when the question is asked
 uttar pradesh main dangon ke lekar har roj nae aankade jari ho rahe hai
 How the relief of the riot victims between the juggernaut and politics of such figures is a big question

 pashchim bengal main sattarudh trinmul congress ne buudhvaar ko sevanivrutt nyaayadhish eke ganguli se rajya maanavadhikaar ayog ke adhyaksh pad se istipha dene kii apil kii
 Ganguly is accused of sexually assaulting a young girl doing an internship in law
 sattarudh party kaa kahana he ki usne 'janata kii maang par' ganguli se yah apil kii he
 Former Supreme Court judge Ganguly, however, says that the allegations leveled against him are "completely baseless and false"
 trinmul saansad derek o'breen ne ek bayaan main kaha, 'tunmul sevanivrutt nyaayadhish par yon utpeedan kaa aarope lagane se chintit he
 Whether the charge against him is right or wrong, but given the perception that has been created among the public, Ganguly's continuation of the post of the Chairman of the Commission will send a wrong message to the public
 ' Since the Trinamool Congress has announced that it will take a very strict stance on the safety and dignity of women at workplaces, o'brien said, "people holding senior positions in public service should treat female colleagues in a way that His image could become that of an ideal person
 ' He said, "justice Ganguly, who has full faith in justice, should step down so that the sanctity of the post which he currently occupies is intact
" ' It may be noted that there has not been a better relationship between the Trinamool government and the head of the State Human Rights Commission
 ganguli apane kai adeshon ke jariye mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ko sharminda kar chuke hai
 Justice Ganguly, however, declined to comment on o'brien's statement

 pradhanmantri se lagaai madad kii guhanimal khan road par maujuud dukaanon par vyapaariyon ne 'no Vehicle, No Parking' policy ke virodh main poster bhi chipkaae
 The traders marched on foot and shouted slogans against the administration
 vyapaaree varun raaj ne virodh jataate hue kaha, yah policy bina taiyaari ke lagu kii gai he
 There is no separate parking after the policy is implemented here
 saath hi jo parking kaa intjaam he wo behad mahangaa he
 He said that due to non-entry of car, the customers shopping in the car no longer come on Ajmal Khan Road
 12 se 15 lakh kii shopping karne vaala khariddaar car main saamaan lekar jaataa tha, lekin ab wo kaise aayega? unhone kaha ki ham pradhanmantri narendra modi se vyapriyon or karol baag ke vyapaar ko bachaane kii apil karte hai, pradhanmantri hamaari madad karen
 It is alleged that the businessmen suffered huge losses due to which the entry of the car was banned on Ajmal Khan Road without talking to them
 pradarshan ke dauraan vyapaaree vinod monga ne kaha, car kii entry par pratibandh raaton-raat laga diya gaya
 Traders were not negotiated before implementing the policy

 unhone kaha ki dilli kaa mausam 6 maheene tak ausatan 40 degree rahata he, is garmi main paidal chalanaa behad mushkil kaam he
 President of Ajmal Khan Retail Market Association, Rajesh Mehra said that this is a big conspiracy to stall the market
 kisi ghar me shaadi, ajmal khan road se khariddaari ke bina nahin hoti he
 Many shops have closed after the ban on car entry, the administration did not call the traders for discussion
 maang puri naa karne par vyapaaree karenge andolanphilhal vyapaaree sanghathan maang kar rahaa he ki jald se jald ajmal khan road par vaahanon kii entry dobaaraa shuru karai jaae
 Traders have also warned to agitate if the demand is not accepted
 uttari dilli nagar nigam kii kamishnar varsha joshi kaa kahana he ki karol baag main darjanon vyapaaree sanghathan hai, jo vaahanon ke pratibandh se sahamat hai
 However, she said that she would soon discuss the entire matter with the opposing merchant organization

 After doing some puja, Baba assured him that he would soon find a suitable groom for the girl
 'ladki ke anusaar kuch dinon ke baad baba ke paas ladki kaa phone aayaa ki apane biodata kii ek copy or photo bhej de
 The girl in the FIR has said, 'I did it without any question

 i found it a little strange, but i did not take it seriously
 iske baad usne meri baayin hatheli kii photo bhejne kaa kaha
 After seeing my palm, it was said that black magic has been done on me
 'ladki ke anusaar, 'usne kaha ki vah is bhalaa se chhutkaaraa dilaa degaa or paisa kuch bhi nahin legaa
 After this he said that i will have to send a photo of my private part
 usne kisimhila caprivet part kaa ek photo bhi bheja, yah samajhane ke liye ki mujhe kis tarah se photo bhejnaa he

 But today, when Sanjay Singh's nominee Narayan Das Gupta and Sushil Gupta were finalized in the AAC party's PAC, Kejriwal's decision on the name of both started to be criticized

 Sharad Yadav, who will always be important in the party, during the Janata Durbar program at the Chief Minister's residence, Nitish Kumar said that he could continue in this position till the new president was elected on the basis of new membership, but he did not want to work as national president

 This is his greatness and the importance he has had in our party will remain intact

 There is no need to derive any other meaning about this

 Others will tell the candidature for the post of PM, during the general elections of 2014, Nitish said that it was said in a special context
 unhone kaha ki main us seat kaa koi daavedaar nahin hum
 We will continue the work we are doing in Bihar, but it is our moral and political duty to express our views on important issues at the national level
 unhone kaha ki is pad ke laayak khud ko samajhane kaa prashn he to koi swayan apane bare main kya bolegaa
 Others will understand this worth
 90 din kaa intjaar nahin kar paae nitishadusri ore bihar ke purv up mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne nitish ko jediu adhyaksh banane kii itani jaldi kya thi ki 90 din pehle hi sharad yadav kaa istipha le liya
 JDU has no base outside Bihar
 phir bhi sharad yadav kaa aansu bharaa istipha le liya gaya

 unhone poocha ki rashtrawaad ke naam par bani sarkaar ke rahete javaanon ko haath lagane kii kisi kii himmat kaise ho gai
 In this video of more than 13 minutes, Vishwas said, "can we think out of the flattery and circle of our party and our leaders for some time in this country

 suresh prabhu kya railway ke liye manmohan singh ho sakate hai? ikyanwe vaale manmohan singh! yah sawaal vitt mantri arun jetali ke liye isliye nahin uthta kyonki unki train to stesan chhod chuki he
 However, 2016 may be the year of Railway Minister Prabhu
 bajet hameshaa bade, mahatvapurn or nirnaayak hote hai lekin sabhi bajet haragij nahin
 Few budgets get the chance to be like 1991, which will change the entire DNA of who says the face of a country's economy
 vakt, maukey or dastur ke mutabik, suresh prabhu railway ke maamle main thik vahiin khadey hai jahaan dow
 Manmohan Singh stood in 1991
 or railway bhi thik usee haal main he jahaan bhartiya arthvyavastha ikyanwe main thi
 Just as there was no way other than moving forward on revolutionary reforms in 1991, in the same way, Prabhu has lost the option to maintain the railway as a tit
 1991 main bharat ke aarthik halaat se aaj kii railway ke halaat kii tulana hamen uske sankat or prabhu ke liye avasar ko samajhane main madad kar sakati he
 In 1991, India was a competition-free, financial crisis-ridden, monopoly-laden country with no access to new technology and rapid change
 is dakiyanoosee dhaanche ne bharat ko deshi se lekar videshi morchon tak kai aarthik dushchakron se gher diya tha
 Railways is the victim of such a vicious cycle
 kuch aankade jaananaa jaruri he
 Freight and passenger transport is the main business of the railways
 arthvyavastha main growth or logon kii aay badhane ke saath donon hi tarah kaa parivahan bad rahaa he lekin parivahan bazaar main railway kaa hissaa 1990 main 56 fisadi se ghatakar 2012 main 30 fisadi ho gaya
 In the freight market, the share of railways fell from 62 to 36 percent in three decades and from 28 to 14 percent in passenger business
 exis diarect research kii ek taaja report ke mutabik, bhartiya rail prati kilometre yatri parivahan par 54 paise kharch karti he or 26 paise kaa rajasav kamaati he
 In comparison, China's railway revenue is 63 percent more
 railway ne ghate kii bharpai ke liye lagataar haada badhaakar maal parivahan bazaar se khud ko baahar kar liya he
 Despite the demand for freight and passenger transportation, the railways have not been able to increase its network name in the last 20 years
 bhartiya rail duniya kii sabase dhimi rail he jahaan malgadiyon kii ausat speed 25 kimi or yatri trainon kii gati 70 kimi he
 91 per cent of its total income is spent on salary allowances, interest on loans and old-fashioned work
 aadhunikeekaran ke abhaav main iskaa puraa network charmara chukaa he, jahaan durghatnaon kii sankhya vishwa main sabase zyada he
 In fact, if the railways were a company, the investors would have completely shied away from it and declared it ill, so by the time of Prabhu's arrival, the railways had actually defaulted in getting the loan and at the moment it was running on the loan from the Life Insurance Corporation of India
 Has been 1991 main bhartiya arthvyavastha main sudhaaron kii shuruyaat vyapak punargathan or kuch badi pariyojnaon se hui thi jinhen banane-baithne main kareeb paanch saal kaa vakt laga tha
 In this case, Prabhu is wealthier than Manmohan
 unke paas sudhaaron kaa agenda maujuud he or yah bhi pataa he ki kis variyatakram par kya karnaa he
 The greatest immediate need of the railway is to reduce congestion on its network
 agar kisi rail mantri ko sachmuch sudhaarak sabit hona he to use sab kuch chhodkar sirf ek pariyojna par puri takat jhonk deni chahie or vah pariyojna he mumbai ko dilli (1,500 kimi) or ludhiana ko kolkata (1,800 kimi) se jodgaye vaala dedicated fret coridor (diefasi), jo railway se maal parivahan kii puri tasviir badal degaa
 For both the corridors, 90 and 75 per cent land acquisition has been completed respectively and assistance from Japan and World Bank was also decided
 diefasi bhale hi maal parivahan kii pariyojna ho lekin iskaa asli phayda railway ke yatri parivahan ko milegaa
 The entire network of freight trains will be handed over to this corridor as soon as the DFC is formed, which will help the railways to clear the tracks for their passenger trains, increase the speed of trains and run new trains
 dedicated fret coridor ko is sarkaar main vaise hi variyata milani chahie thi jaisi ki sadak pariyojnaon ko vaajapeyi sarkaar main mili thi
 Resources for DFC are running high, but the current network of railways requires more resources
 railway duniya kii sabase badi parivahan company he, jise karj par chalaanaa naammumkin he
 If Prabhu is truly courageous, then this budget is the best chance to reorganize the railway
 jis tarah 1991 main manmohan singh ne rupye ko ekamusth niyantran mukt kar bharat ko aadhunik deshon kii shrenee main pahunchaa diya tha, thik usee tarah prabhu railway kaa purana dhaancha dhahaakar ise ek aadhunik railway company banane kaa safar shuru kar sakate hai
 a company that provides superb service at the right price, not everything from running a school and a pharmacy to a wheel and axle
 railway kaa punargathan hi use bachaane kaa jariya he, jo railway menuphaccharing ke nijeekaran or railway sampattiyon kii bikri kaa rasta kholegaa
 This will provide resources to the Railways so that it can modernize its network
 rail mantri prabhu chahen to kiraaya, maal haada badhaakar or kuch pratikatmak suvidhaon kaa elaan karke ek or bajet ko jaaya kar sakate hai yaa phir sachmuch krantikari ho sakate hai
 Railways are the largest transport system in India
 sujh-boojh or sansadhano kii kami railway kii badahaali kii utani badi vajah nahin he jitna ki rajnatik netritv ke asamanjas va dakiyanooseepan
 The railway budget of 2016 will not be judged on the scale of courage of Suresh Prabhu

 Let me tell you that in the politics of Tamil Nadu politics, two film stars have taken entry recently
 camel hasan ke alaava south superstar rajnikant bhi raajnneeti main shaamil ho chuke hai
 Significantly, actor Kamal Haasan recently congratulated Rahul Gandhi on taking over as Congress President
 hasan ne kaha tha ki unhen puraa bharosa he ki rahul kaam karenge or vah apane bujurgon ke jaise aadar ke paatr hai
 The Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi, who was elected Amethip on Monday on a three-day visit to his parliamentary constituency for the first time after a crushing defeat in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, faced the ire of party workers
 rahul ne kaaryakartaaon ko halaat badalane kaa aashwaasan diya or aagaamee chunaav ke liye phir se qamar kasne ke liye kaha
 Arriving at Tiloi in Amethi via Lucknow, Rahul held separate meetings with party workers and leaders at the Ram Janaki Balika Vidya Mandir
 kaaryakartaaon ne tikat vitaran sahit vibhinn muddon par naaraazgi vyakt kii or kaha ki bade netaaon dwaara unki upeksha kii jaati he or unki baat alaakaman tak nahin pahunchaai jaati
 a worker involved in the meeting said that Rahul asked for three months' time and said that the organization would be fermented
 saath hi unhone kaha ki ab vah sidhe kaaryakartaaon se samvaad sthapit karenge
 The role of the middle people will end
 kaaryakartaaon kii suni jaaegi
 After forgetting the defeat of the last assembly election, Rahul called upon the party workers to gear up again for the upcoming elections
 unhone kaha ki kaaryakarta congress kii ridh hai
 After Tiloi, Rahul is scheduled to have a meeting with workers and leaders in the Salon assembly constituency in Amethi
 vah teen charnon main booth or block str ke party kaaryakartaaon se lekar vidhansabha or jila str ke netaaon ke saath baithak kar rahe hai
 During the three-day visit, Rahul will hold a meeting with activists and leaders in five assemblies in Amethi and try to find out the reasons for the defeat
 vidhansabha chunaav main congress amethi kii paanch main se keval do siten jeet pai, jabaki raibareli main uskaa khaataa tak nahin khulaa
 He had to face defeat in all five seats here
 radhe maa ek baar phir vivaad main najar aa rahi he, darasal khud ko devi kehane vaali radhe maa shuukravaar ko centre shasit pradesh daman main pahunchi hui thim
 Here she along with daman-diu MP Lalu Patel arrived at the Kanteshwar temple to offer prayers
 is dauraan vah mandir main aarti ke taal par kuch is tarah naachin ki har koi soch main pad gaya
 Radhe Maa danced fiercely here
 gauratlab he ki khud ko devi durga kaa avatar bataane vaali radhe maa lambe vakt ke baad is tarah sarvajanik tair par dikhaai di hai
 Prior to this, she had been in a lot of controversy
 radhe maa aksar apane pahanaave, ajibo-garib tareeke se logon ke ksht hataane vaali or bhakton ko laal gulab dekar 'ai lav you from bottm of maai heart' kehane vaali radhe maa ke is tarahamandir main dancekarne se bahoot log aahat hai
 Behind Radhe Maa is a girl of a village of devotees who married a man running a sweet shop, she later became Radhe Maa
 ab radhe main maa peeche uske andh bhakton kii fouj he, lekin sawaal unki ravaiye, unke pahanaave unke bhakton ko aashirwad dene ke andaaj or libaas par uth rahe hai
 Not only does she look in a mini skirt, but her way of giving her blessings is even more strange
 radhe maa apane haath main hameshaa pile rang kaa ek trishul rakhti hai
 She represents herself like the Hindu goddess Durga
 unke bhakt har 15 din baadamaata kii chowkeesjate hai or devi kii tarah unki puja karte hai
 After the failure of Shahrukh Khan's film Zero, there was confusion about his upcoming film
 haal hi main khabar ai thi ki siddharth roy kapur or roni scruwala ke production main banane ja rahi film 'saare jahaan se acha' ko shahrukh ne chhod diya he
 This film is a biopic of Rakesh Sharma and Aamir Khan also showed great interest in the film
 kaha ja rahaa tha ki shahrukh rakesh sharma kii byopic ke bajaae farhaan akhtar kii film don 3 ke liye taiyaariyaan shuru kar rahe hai
 However, the film's writer Anjum Rajabali has clarified that the news of Shah Rukh leaving the film is a rumor
 anjum se jab poocha gaya ki kya shahrukh ab film 'saare jahaan se acha' kaa hissaa nahin hai to unhone massej kaa riplai karte hue kaha ki ye ek phek news he
 According to reports, Shah Rukh may soon begin preparations for the role of this famous pilot
 gauratlab he ki rakesh sharma pehle aise bhartiya the jinhone antariksh kii yatra kii thi
 Talking about the script of the film, Shah Rukh said that the story is very spectacular and as soon as the makers announce the timing they will start working on the film

 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye prachaar joro par jari he
 The first phase of voting has ended and now the second phase is ready
 shuukravaar ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne maharashtra main chunavi sabha ko sambodhit kiya
 In this rally, the PM attacked the Congress fiercely and accused the 'tughlaq Road Scam'
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ahmednagar kii raily main kaha ki aaj duniya bharat ko mahashakti maanati he, lekin pehle jab 10 saal tak ek sarkaar thi to desh main niraashaa thi
 The country has to decide whether the honest watchman will run or the corrupt Namdar, the country has to choose from the heroes of India and the advocates of Pakistan
 modi bole ki congress ne tughlaq road ghotaalaa kiya he, congress ke netaa ke ghar madhya pradesh se note bhar-bhar kar aae the
 The money that was meant to save children from malnutrition, the Congress is investing that money in the elections
 lekin ye chaukeedaar chaukanna he, chori nahin karne degaa
 He said that the watchman has instilled fear among the terrorists, the watchman will also punish them by removing them from the base
 pichhali sarkaar pakistan ke saamne kamjor lagati thi, chaukeedaar kii sarkaar aatankiyon ko ghar main ghuskar maarane kii ijaajat detii he
 He said that the countrymen are happy with this, but some people are nothing
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki aaj congress-ensipi un logon ke saath khadey hai, jo desh main do pradhanmantri chaahate hai
 There is less trust in the Congress but Sharad Rao too agreed on this matter
 piem ne kaha ki kashmir ke liye desh ke hajaaron javaanon ne balidaan diya, lekin kya aap ab kashmir ke do tukade hone denge
 Today, crores of young colleagues are getting loans without guarantee from the bank for self-employment, so the strength of your vote is behind it
 gaanv-gaanv main sadaken ban rahi hai, varshon se latake railway project agar aaj puure ho rahe hai to iske peeche bhi aapke vot kii takat he: piem shri narendra modi # modihiaayegapic

 com / grbmegixxa— BJP (@bjp4india)april 12, 2019ahmednagar main piem modi ne kaha ki congress kah rahi he ki vah kashmir main javaanon ko mili vishesh adhikaar ko hataa degi, lekin main first time votaron se apil karata hum ki vah desh ko dhyaan main rakhkar matdaan karen
 Today, the country stands with one vote on the issue of national security
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki 23 may ke baad jab hamaari sarkaar banegi to ham desh ke har kisaanon ko 6000 rupee salanaa kii madad denge, itnaa hi nahin kisaanon or chote dukandaaron ko pension bhi denge
 Now the public has given the slogan that remove the Congress, only then the country will move forward

 According to this price, Samsung's flagship S10e can only be kept with it, which is currently priced at Rs 47,500 for Black (6GB RAM + 128GB storage) on Amazon
 lekin spacifications or fitures ke maamle main oneplus 7 Pro samsung ke is phone se aage he
 Similarly, the 64GB variant of the iphone XR for Apple Lovers in the premium category is present on Flipkart for Rs 59,900
 jabaki isse kam keemat main aapako 7 Pro kaa top verient mil rahaa he or spacifications ke maamle main yahaan bhi vanplus kaa flagship aage he
 Well it is a different matter that Apple has its own ecosystem
 aise main 7 Pro premium category main ek best opshan he
 So let us know whether you should buy this smartphone? Design, build-quality and Display: The first thing you will feel when you take it in hand is that this smartphone has to be weighed
 isaki screen kaa sies 6
 7-inch
 yani ye vajani hone ke saath-saath ek haath se handle karne main bhi aapako pareshaan karegaa
 However, you will get used to it while using it
 vajan mere khyaal se badi bydaree or metal construction kii vajah se zyada he
 The rest of the back panel is quite premium looking, with glass finishing and textured matte
 ungaliyon ke nishaan yahaan teji se padate hai, aise main drop hone se bhi bachaane ke liye box ke saath diya gaya cese yuj kar sakate hai
 The rest of the bottom has a speaker, SIM slot and USB Type c port and the right side has a power button and alert slider
 vahiin left kii taraf power wolum or top main pop-ap selfi camera diya gaya he
 Keep in mind that there is no slot here for additional memory cards and 3
 5mm headphone jaik bhi aapako nahin milegaa
 Overall build-quality is quite good and gets a premium look
 front panel kii baat karen to yahaan pop-ap selfi kii vajah se koi noch nahin he
 We have already told you the size
 baaki isamen wireles charging or IP certyphoid reating nahin di gai he
 Talking about the display, this is its biggest feature
 yahaan 6
 a 67-inch Curved QHD + (3120 x 1440 pixels) Fluid AMOLED display has been given as well as a 90hz refresh rate
 jo noch les disple or karvd agej ke saath kaaphi jabardast banaata he
 This screen is great for gamers
 apadats ke saath company ne iske tach experience main bhi sudhaar laayaa he
 Keep in mind that when you get used to the 90hz refresh rate, then the animations of other smartphones will be seen doing a bit of lag
 baaki colors, brietens or contrast main bhi koi dikkat nahin he
 Also, the side viewing angle is also excellent and till now only used to be in the Samsung panel, while Magic has been shown by oneplus a lot
 haalanki samsung ke panel kii tulana main 19-20 kaa fark jarur najar aayega
 It also has support for HDR10 + and a video enhancer for video and the High 516ppi makes your visual experience great
 baaki blue lite filter ke liye nite mod bhi diya gaya he
 It has an in-display fingerprint sensor which is quite fast
 software:is smartphone main Android 9 Pie besd oxygenos (v9
 5) has been supported
 vanplus kaa interphes vaise hi behad clin interphes ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Here too the company has repeated the same story
 khaas fitures kii baat karen to is baar yahaan screen recorder diya gaya he
 Which is provided with one touch access
 duusare khaas feechar kii baat karen to isamen gaming ke liye dadicated Fnatic mod diya gaya he
 Which prepares the phone only for gaming, ceasing all other work
 iske alaava isamen khaas Zen mod diya gaya he jo aapako 20 minute ke liye virtual duniya se dur kar detaa he
 During this time, you will only be able to click emergency call and photo in the phone and once activated, you cannot even close it
 saath hi yahaan olves on disple nahin diya gaya he
 However, it is ready to be given through an update
 in sabake alaava notification lite kii bhi main tarif karnaa chaahunga
 Whenever the notification comes in your phone, the curved edges of the screen will have a flash of blue color which looks quite cool
 baaki puraa interphes clin or smood he or koi khaas blott najar nahin aaenge
 The good thing is that the smartphone is getting better with new updates
 parformens:hamane is smartphone ko hamane 12GB ram or flagship snapadragon 855 procesar ke saath yuj kiya he
 We have not had any problem even after using more than 1 month in daily use
 sari chijen chahen ap switch karnaa ho yaa ap open karnaa ho yaa multiple ap yuj karnaa ho, ye puri tarah se best he
 Higher refresh rate uses and four moons
 PUBG mobile or Asphalt 9 jaise heavi game main bhi aapako koi dikkat nahin aegi
 After only 20-25 minutes you may have a problem of mild hitting, but you can ignore it
 isamen Dolby Atmos ko bhi audio ke liye diya gaya he
 Talking about that, you will really get a powerful stereo speaker
 haalanki yearpis spikar main aawaaj kam lagegi or down firing spikars main behatar quality milegi
 But overall sound balance will be felt
 saath main iskaa phayda aap headfones main bhi le sakate hai
 Camera and Battery: First of all talk about the specifications of the camera, here is a triple camera setup in the rear
 is smartphone ke rier main primary camera 48-megapixl soni IMX586 sensor (aparchar f / 1
 6) is yahi sensor Redmi Note 7 Pro jaise smartfones main bhi miltaa he
 Also, OIS and EIS have been supported here
 doosraa camera telephoto lens vaala 8 megapixl sensor he
 Its aperture f / 2
 4 he
 Only OIS support will be available here
 third camera ultra-wide angel lens vaala 16-megapixl sensor he
 Its aperture f / 2
 2 he
 There is also support for dual LED flash, 3X optical zoom, multi autofocus (PDAF, LAF, CAF)
 saath hi yahaan portret, ultra-shot, nitemod, pro-mod, AI seen ditection, panorama, HDR, studio liting or RAW image file saport jaise standard fitures bhi maujuud hai
 Now talk about the primary camera directly, then to tell you to click the 48 megapixel image, you have to do it in JPEG and RAW
 baaki auto mod main aap 12MP kii photo clic kar paaenge
 You will get the best shots in the daylight with the primary sensor
 vahiin raat main lo-lite parformens aapako pareshaan karegaa
 But for this you can take help of nightscape mode
 lekin yahaan samasya ye he ki is mod main standard lens kii madad le paaenge, yahaan tak kii juum bhi nahin kar paaenge
 After this you will get good photos during the day in portrait mode, but for this the background of the subject should be at a short distance
 portret mod main hamen tasviren kuch zyada pasand nahin ai
 The biggest problem is that you will be able to take shots in portrait only with the zoom camera
 aise main agar kisi choti se jagah par baith kar aap portate shots lenaa chahen to pareshaan ho jaaenge
 After several updates in Nightscape mode, the pictures are amazing, which you can see here
 yahaan focus karne main bhi koi dikkat nahin he or HDR shots bhi kamaal ke hai
 i would like to tell you one more thing that at times during the day you will get more dark colors from the primary sensor, which does not look natural
 iske baad baat karte hai telephoto sensor kii to yahaan losles kaa daawa company ne kiya tha, lekin 3X phul juum main tasveeron main behatar quality nahin milti
 This problem increases further during the night
 ab ultra wide angel lens kii baat karen to yahaan mujhe tasviren din main thik-thaak lageen
 i am saying this because like Samsung Galaxy S10, there is not much wide view and the quality is not so good
 raat main ye dikkat or bad jaati he
 Likewise, during video shooting, you do not get the help of wide angle lens
 ye badi samasya he
 Speaking of video shooting, slow-motion here can be done at 1080p 240fps or 720p 480fps
 yahaan video recording ke liye 4K kaa saport he lekin 60fps par 5 minute kii recording or 4K 30fps par 10 minute kii recording milti he
 In the rest of 1080p, you can do your own recording
 yahaan stabiligeshan kamaal kii he or focusing main bhi koi dikkat nahin he
 Finally, talking about the front camera, these cameras are excellent
 yahaan pop-ap selfi camera diya gaya he
 This is the 16 megapixel Sony IMX471 sensor
 iskaa aparchar f / 2
 Is 0 and EIS support is also present here
 HDR kaa rispons bhi yahaan behatar he
 Now speaking of battery, this smartphone has a 4000mah battery with Warp Charge 30 fast charging support
 ise aap heavi yuj main bhi 14 ghanton tak chalaa sakate hai, joki 90hz rifresh rate ke saath vaala aankada he
 In such a situation it is better
 normal yuj main ise aap 20 ghanton se bhi zyada chalaa sakate hai
 You can also use the phone at 60hz refresh rate to further improve the battery

 5 / 10 'will Ram Temple become 2019 issue on the agenda of Agenda Aaj Tak?' But there was a fierce debate between the leaders
 is kaarykram main eimm ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi, congress netaa abhishek manu singhvi or bijepi se sudhanshu trivedi ne shirkat kii
 Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi, in the program, the three leaders were seen accusing each other of the party on the issue of Ram temple, triple talaq and reservation
 congress netaa abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha ki bijepi netaa or asaduddin ovaisi ji ek hi bhashaa bolte hai
 Both make statements that break the country
 ye donon keval hindu-muslim kii baat kar apni raajnneeti chamakaane jaanate hai
 Singhvi said that both of them are only doing politics regarding the Ram temple, they also know that the matter is in the court and the decision of the court will be valid for all, but both keep making statements to mislead the public
 , One says that a Ram temple will be built in Ayodhya and another says that a mosque will be built there
 abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha ki congress renbo party he, sabko saath lekar chalati he
 i love saffron and wear it often
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki main bijepi kaa ho gaya
 According to Singhvi, the constitution does not allow reservation to be given on the basis of religion, but if a section of a religion is found to be economically viable, then special reservation can be made for it
 BJP netaa sudhanshu trivediwahin bijepi netaa aarope lagaaya ki congress or eimm ke vichaar ek jaise hai
 The government has also run together
 sudhanshu trivedi ne kaha ki donon deshhit main kam, aatankiyon ke paksh hameshaa ek saath najar aate hai
 Whether it is Zakir Naik or Afzal Guru, who is responsible for the attack on Parliament
 donon partiyon ne inaki phikr hoti he lekin 1948 main jang shahid hone vaale jawan kii yaad nahin aati
 He was also a Muslim, but he is more worried about those who break the country
 asaduddin ovaisi kaa bjp-congress ko javababijepi or congress ke aaropon kaa jawaab dete hue eimm ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi bollywood ke gane 'razia gundon main funs gai
 
 
 And cited Umrao Jaan
 unhone kaha ki unki in donon jaisi halaat nahin he
 Owaisi wanted to say that his party is neither with Congress nor with BJP
 ham desh ke saamne sachai rakhte hai jo in donon partiyon ko hajam nahin hoti
 Owaisi told Aaj Tak's forum that caste is the truth of the country, it cannot be denied
 ram mandir ke mudde par apni raay rakhte hue ovaisi ne kaha ki 1955 ne pehle bijepi ke agenda main kahin ram mandir nahin tha
 The BJP remembered Rama in 1989, as he looked closer to Delhi
 tabhi se party ise raajnneeti mudda bana rahi he
 Owaisi said that former PM Narasimha Rao also wanted a Ram temple to be built in Ayodhya
 ovaisi ke mutabik pehle congress ne musalamaanon ke liye kuch nahin kiya sirf votbank banaakar rakhaa ab bijepi unhen kinare kar apana votbank majboot kar rahi he
 He said that the court verdict on the Ram temple will be valid for all
 or sabhi ko iskaa intjaar karnaa chahie

 Everyone's eyes are on Pataliputra seat
 har koi yah jaananaa chahta he ki aakhir is seat se lalu prasad kii beti misa bharti jitati hai yaa unke 'chaachaaon' main se koi ek
 Here is the 22nd installment of 'bihar Diary before Election', taking stock of the political wave of the state
 
 
 jaisi suchanaaen mil rahi hai, us hisaab se patliputra seat lalu khandaan ke paale main ja sakati he
 Misa has received most of the votes of the Yadavs and Muslims, votes of the Kahars, Dhanukas and Dalits among the most backward castes
 iskaa ek matlab ye he ki jo jatiyaan nitish ko haal ke saalon main vot dene lagi thim, ve nitish kii party ko is chunaav main maranasann maanakar phir se lalu kii taraf laut ai hai
 Basically these few castes are staunch voters of the Mandal family, which the BJP does not want at any cost
 bihar main aise votaron kii sankhya bhi acchhee-khaasi he
 Secondly, Lalu has also given tickets to middle castes like Dhanuk and Gangaut, its statewide effect is visible
 lekin ahm baat yah he ki ye seat lalu kii pratishtha kii seat thi
 But will this happen on every seat? Anyway, Lalu lost last time with very few votes
 is baar ladaai trikoniya he, to ranjan yadav vaise bhi maidan se baahar hai
 Lalu had also cleverly made the son of Brahmeshwar Mukhiya, the Ranveer Sena, stand
 aise main usne agar 10-15 hajaar vot bhi kaata, to ramkripal khet ho jaaenge
 Some people say that there was a silent sympathy among the backward people due to Lalu's going to jail, which has had little effect on the election
 itnaa to tay he ki bihar main mandal parivaar kaa kattar voter lalu or nitish main se ek ko hi maidan main rahane dena chahega
 So is Lalu's renegotiation hidden in Nitish's defeat? It is too early to say, because there is a section in the same backward class, which does not want to see the Yadavs recaptured in power at any cost
 lekin maujuuda rujhaan agar jari rahaa or jediu isi tarah har seat par kamjor hota rahaa, to ladaai main sirf bijepi gathbandhan or argedy gathbandhan batch jaaenge
 On the other hand, it is also true that if the talk of Lalu's rise spread in a big way, then all the anti-lalu castes will gather around the BJP, thereby ending the jdu's true hope
 philhal lalu gathbandhan 15 ke aasapaas siten letaa to dikh hi rahaa he

 According to Ramdev, the decision of demonetisation has broken the back of terrorists
 unki sari takat kaale paise se hi chalati thi, jise pradhanmantri ne ek jatke main nestnabud kar diya
 Ramdev described the Prime Minister's life as a threat from terrorism mafia, political mafia and drug mafia
 jab ramdev se political mafia ke bare main saaf karne ke liye kaha to unhone kaha, 'ye vahi log hai jinhone hajaaron karodon ke note jamaa kar rakhe the

 The NIA claims that there is no prosecutable evidence against Sadhvi Pragya Thakur
 isaki vajah he maamle par macoka kanoon kaa na bananaa, jabaki trial court ne abhi tak macoka hataane par koi faisla nahi diya he
 According to the NIA - the lmlfreedom motor cycle that made Sadhvi accused was in the name of Sadhvi, but Ram Ji Kalsangra, an absconding accused, was using her long before the blast
 iske alaava aaropee sudhakar dvivedi se bam plant karne ke 2 faraar aaropee raamji kaalsangra or sandip daange ko milaane or uske jariye karnal prasad purohit se arady eks mangane ke liye kehane kaa bayaan dene vaale gavaah apane puraane bayaan se mukar chuke hai
 Since MCOCA is not made on the case, his earlier confession would not be considered as evidence in the court
 haalanki maamle par ab bhi macoka barqaraar he, jabaki karnal prasad purohit ke bare main enie kii raay alag he
 In its charge sheet in May 2016, the NIA described Colonel Prasad Shrikant Purohit as one of the prime accused in the blasts

 After the arrest of Pragya Thakur, Colonel Purohit had smsed the accused Sameer Kulkarni that ATS had come to his house in Pune
 karnal ne use turant telephone se sabhi nabanr ko delit kar bhopal chhodane ko kaha tha
 The Colonel is also accused of arranging and supplying RDX for the blast

 In its investigation, Maharashtra ATS arrested 11 people including Sadhvi Pragya Thakur

 The NIA, after its investigation, on 13 May 2016, claimed that there was no prosecutable evidence against 6 people, including Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, in the Second Supplementary Chargesheet stating that there was no basis for imposing MCOCA in the case
 jabaki karnal prasad purohit sahit 10 logon ke khilaaf dhamaake kii sajeesh, hatya, hatya kii koshish, arms act, explosive act or you e pi e ke tahat muqadama chalaane laayak saboot hone kaa daawa kiya tha
 It is another matter that the trial court did not agree with the opinion of the NIA, after which Sadhvi Pragya Thakur and Colonel Purohit filed bail in the Bombay High Court

 saaf niyat sahi vikaas, 2019 main phir modi sarkaar
 But how many numbers does the public give to the government on these four years of work? Are people happy with the work of the government? Are they ready to vote for this government and BJP again? Has there been any difference in the popularity of Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi? CSDS and Lokniti have conducted a survey about all these questions

 It may be heartening for the Congress that the BSP with which its friendly has given good signs in UP, that BSP can get 4% and its allies, including Samajwadi Party, can get 6% votes, ie upa's 10% increase is visible in the account

 Its main point was that the earlier leadership focused too much on the West and did not care about the neighborhood
 ravaie main badlaav kaa bada sanket yah bhi he ki china ne aakhirkaar pakistan se hokar guzarane vaale coridor kaa kaam aage badhaane kaa faisla kar liya he
 The decision was first announced by Xi during the visit of Pakistan President Mamnoon Hussain to Beijing in February last year
 phir november main jab pradhanmantri navaj sharif beijing gaye to faisle par phir jor diya gaya
 In the months that followed, there was also a hurry to take the project forward
 india today ko pataa chalaa he ki pichley kuch hafton main china ne bhugarbha vigyaniyon or ejiniyaron kii toli ravaanaa kii he
 The team is currently investigating the relevance of this project in Peshawar and the surrounding areas
 ab tak ke nattejey china ke liye aashajanak bataae jate hai
 Will CPEC be involved in the project? The ambitious idea is to connect the restive Jinjiang area surrounded by the inaccessible region with Central, West Asia via highways, pipelines and railway lines
 is yojana ke tahat kashgar (puraane silk road kaa ek shahar, jahaan china aarthik vikaas kshetra bana rahaa he) se karakoram rajmarg ke saath-saath pakistan adhikrut kashmir ke raste peshawar or guadar tak buniyadi dhaanche kaa vikaas or bijli pariyojnaayen kaayam karnaa he
 China has already helped build ports at Gwadar on the Arabian Sea
 isse china ke liye tel or gas sambandhi aayaat ke liye ek nayaa rasta khul jayega, jo abhi sankari malaka kii khadi or vivaadaaspad dakshin china sagar ke raste par hi nirbhar he
 In January, Beijing inaugurated a pipeline that connects the southwestern province of Yunnan to the island of Mande in Myanmar
 china ko ummid he ki guadar se ek or vikalp khul jayega
 Impact on India: The CPEC scheme has a broad impact for India
 is yojana par aage badhkar china ne saaf jaahir kar diya he ki uski manshaa paak adhikrut kashmir main sthaayee thikaana banane kii he
 His attitude is different from the attitude of the last two decades on Kashmir
 haalanki china ke adhikari jor dekar kehete hai ki uske is ravaie main koi badlaav nahin aayaa he ki kashmir masale kaa hal 'bharat or pakistan ko nikaalnaa' he
 But according to Indian officials, the first signs of a change in attitude were seen in 2009, when China started giving stapled visas to the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 vah pakistan adhikrut kashmir ke logon ke maamle main aisa nahin karata
 In response, India deferred exchanges in defense matters and indicated that its stance on Tibet and 'one China' was linked to China's stance on Kashmir
 phir, china ne kareeb do saal pehle natthi vija dena band kar diya
 There is also an interesting fact, to which Andrew Small, author of the new book The china-pakistan Axis, points
 unke mutabik china 'kashmir main aarthik pariyojnaon ke prati kam samvedansheeltaa' dikhaa rahaa he
 According to Small, the 2005 indo-us nuclear deal is a significant change in the case
 uske baad china kaa najariya dwipaksheeya rishton tak hi simit nahin rahaa
 The long-term plan for China is to take up infrastructure and power projects one by one under CPEC
 pakistan par china ke agrani visheshgy, peking vishvavidhyalay ke haan hua kehete hai, "yah 20-25 saal lambii pariyojna he
 There is no going to happen overnight
 " haan ke mutabik pichley kuch saalon main 'suraksha ke masalon' ko lekar is yojana par 'hichak' thi
 He says, "our view is that the basic way of solving the problem of Jinjiang is economic development
 uski bhugolic sthiti ke chalate use purvi china se jodpha mushkil he
 So it is easier to look west
 "haalanki sipiisi yojana kii raah main durgam kshetra ke alaava bhi kai rukaawatein hai
 Currently, the Karakoram highway opens for at least five months due to local weather
 2010 main bhuskhalan or baadh kii vajah se saal bhar se zyada yah rasta band padaa rahaa
 Under the CPEC, long-term plans to open it year-round have to be worked out
 haal kii vaartaon main china or pakistan ne ek samaantar rajmarg banane par vichaar kiya, jo khunjaraab darre main surangen banaakar bhuskhalan se nijaat dilaaegaa
 These ideas are like romantic thoughts and very expensive
 pakistan ke akalan ke mutabik is par 11 arab dollar se zyada kaa kharch aayega
 But, according to David Sidney, who was in charge of the US for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia till 2013, it cannot be dismissed in one stroke
 ve kehete hai, "main is bare main spasht hum ki kashgar-guadar coridor kii koi aarthik sarthakata nahin talaashi ja sakati
 But if China is willing to spend $ 45 billion according to the suggestion, then there is every possibility of change in this area
 " pakistani adhikariyon ne 11 arab dollar ke alaava bijli pariyojnaon main 34 arab dollar ke nivesh kii salaah di he
 Officials in China's foreign ministry deny consent to these figures
 unka kahana he ki baatcheet abhi jari he or har vishesh pariyojna par alag se vichaar hoga
 The great headache of China, not the expense of terror, is a matter of security
 pichley saal jinjiyang main lagaataar bam dhamaake hue
 The incident at the Thien on Man Chowk shows that terror is spreading beyond its territory
 march, 2014 main uigar hamalaavaron ne unnan ke kunming main railway stesan par hamalaa kiya, jisamen 29 logon kii jaan gai or 140 log jakhmi hue
 According to Sydney, the incident led to a 'major change' in China's attitude
 ve kehete hai, "china main aatankwaad ke mudde par pakistan ke saath nae sire se baat karne par punarvichaar chal rahaa he
 The big issue of debate in China is not whether Pakistan is serious or not, but whether it is even capable of looking into China's concerns
 "adhikariyon ko ashanka he ki jinjiyang ilaake ko nivesh ke liye kholane se pashchim kii aatankwaadi takaton se bhi uski najdiki bad sakati he
 Han says, "we also want to do something about the terrorist camps of Bilashak ETIM
 lekin hamen ehsaas he ki hamen pakistan sarkaar ke saath kaam karnaa he, usase duuri nahin banani he
 "according to Amarullah Saleh, former head of Afghanistan's National Security Directorate, this attitude is risky because violence has been increasing for the past two years
 afghanistan china ko itiiem ke aatankiyon se jude kai note bhej chukaa he, jo pakistan main sakriy hai
 Chinese officials themselves have said they are aware of contacts between ETIM and some ISI people
 "china ke liye sawaal yah he ki kisne itiiem ko vahaan aane, thikaana banane or khaanaa, hathiyaar or prashikshan paane kaa bulaava diya?" philhal to yahi lagata he ki beijing is sawaal kaa jawaab dena abhi jaruri nahin samajhegaa

 meri car ke bagal main rukii is car ne kaasi utsukata paidaa kar di
 She started talking loudly with the glass down
 ye kya gaadi he
 What you guys do gaadi ke bheetar safed rang kii ek saaf suthri tank rakhi hui thi
 Honda's large generator and long pipe were wrapped to reach the tank water
 kisi ne bade karine se maaruti iko main iskaa intazaam kiya tha
 No name nor number on the red bar above the car
 chaaron taraf ek hi sandesh likhaa tha
 Please keep a pot of water outside your house
 shukriya
 The driver began to ask why he was roaming around with this message
 unhone bataaya ki hamaare sahab un matakon main pani bharwate hai
 They have got pots near several flyovers or busy bus stands in Delhi
 ham log din main do baar un matakon main pine kaa pani bhar aate hai
 The water is very clear
 janarator or pipe isliye he ki ek boond pani barbaad na ho
 Every drop is poured into the pot
 itnaa sunate hi ek puri kahani raghon main daud gai
 Give the number quickly
 kya naam he aapke sahab kaa
 The driver started to hesitate but gave the number
 sar, main raveesh bol rahaa hum, enditivi india se
 Yes, sorry i could not speak Hindi, if you could speak English
 phone uthaane vaale shaks kii umr awaz se laraz rahi thi
 i told Alagh sir that i do not know English but i can understand English
 bas donon main baat hone lagi
 The 67-year-old Alagh Saheb was not even revealing his full name
 apane kaam ke bare main bataane ko lekar sankoch se bhar gaye
 i like it so i do but not for publicity
 bahut zid kii tab bhi puraa naam nahin bataaya lekin unase vaada le liya ki aapaki kahani na jane kitnon kii soch badal degi, to bas ve maan gaye
 Alagh Saheb appeared to be an engineer by profession
 america se aakar dilli ke panchasheel park main apana baseraa banaaya or dusron ke basere ke aage garibon ko pani pilane kaa rasta khojane lage
 In the city of Delhi, started searching for places and buildings where pottery can be kept
 alagh sahab ne iske liye pani kii bhi khoj kii
 Step by step school and a neighbor promised water
 vahaan se saaf pani ko mataka sthal tak pahunchane ke liye do maaruti iko khridi or use steel kii chaadaron se banaaya taaki jang na lage
 They say that water must be clean and safe
 alagh sahab kii gaadi se hamaari mulaakaat jahaan hui thi usee chiraag dilli fliover ke neeche aath matake rakhe hai
 There are also pots near the bus stand of Asiad Road
 is tarah se unhone 8-10 jagahon par matake rakh diye
 Their only effort is to have someone take responsibility for these mats so that no one can sabotage them
 baaki kaa kaam alagh sahab kaa
 You keep drinking water and their car will be filled
 matake saath alagh sahab ko water cooler kaa bhi khyaal aayaa
 Thought it could be a safe and permanent method
 unhone chalis assi or dedh sau litre ke water cooler lagane shuru kar diye
 The cost on these comes from 30 to 45 thousand
 ye sara karcha alagh sahab khud uthaate hai
 The problem was that everyone wanted to put the cooler inside the yard
 jaise mahrauli road ke jain mandir ke bheetar lagaana padaa kyonki baahar cooler kii suraksha ko lekar sawaal paidaa hone laga
 If a tap is cut, then a sheet
 magar alagh sahab kii chintaa ye thi ki garib to pani se dur ho gaya
 Another problem was that people started carrying water in big pots, due to which the water started running out quickly
 phir kya tha, apni ejineering ke anubhav kaa istamaal kiya or water cooler kii dizine is tarah se taiyaar kii zyaada se zyaada lotaa hi nal ke neeche aa saktaa tha
 Where the water falls from the tap, made it like a cage
 soch yah thi ki pyaasa pani pikar jaae na ki koi in culeron se apana gadaa bhar le jaae
 In this way, Alagh Saheb has installed twenty water coolers in Delhi
 hansate hansate kaha ki paisa or pani donon simit he lekin mujhe yah kaam karnaa acha lagata he
 The comments aapane aisa cooler dekha he jahaan pani ke saath khalil jibran kii panktiyaan bhi likhi ho
 You will definitely enlarge this photo and read the poem
 kavita yahi kahati he ki aapke bachche aapke nahin he
 They have definitely come into this world through you, but they do not belong to you
 unki aatma, soch ye sab aapaki nahin hai
 They have their own
 vaah alagh sahab pani pite pite aise koi kavita kaa paath kara de to isse acha nek kaam or kya ho saktaa he
 Alagh Saheb living in Panchsheel Park of Delhi is a different kind of hydration
 achaanak mili is kahani ne mere bheetar apaar yakeen paidaa kar diya ki system bhale hi haraa de lekin aadmi nahin harata he
 He leaves the system and starts making his own system
 logon kii seva karne lagata he
 The story at the crossroads while returning home from Ira Singhal, who topped the IAS exam even after the physical challenges, gave the opportunity to see the world from the loot and falsehood of political parties
 iske liye alagh sahab kaa shukriya
 We did not meet, but what happened on the phone is enough
 to jor se boliye panchasheel park vaale pani baba kii jai
 The driver began to ask why he was roaming around with this message
 unhone bataaya ki hamaare sahab un matakon main pani bharwate hai
 They have got pots near several flyovers or busy bus stands in Delhi
 ham log din main do baar un matakon main pine kaa pani bhar aate hai
 The water is very clear
 janarator or pipe isliye he ki ek boond pani barbaad na ho
 Every drop is poured into the pot
 itnaa sunate hi ek puri kahani raghon main daud gai
 Give the number quickly
 kya naam he aapke sahab kaa
 The driver started to hesitate but gave the number
 sar, main raveesh bol rahaa hum, enditivi india se
 Yes, sorry i could not speak Hindi, if you could speak English
 phone uthaane vaale shaks kii umr awaz se laraz rahi thi
 i told Alagh sir that i do not know English but i can understand English
 bas donon main baat hone lagi
 The 67-year-old Alagh Saheb was not even revealing his full name
 apane kaam ke bare main bataane ko lekar sankoch se bhar gaye
 i like it so i do but not for publicity
 bahut zid kii tab bhi puraa naam nahin bataaya lekin unase vaada le liya ki aapaki kahani na jane kitnon kii soch badal degi, to bas ve maan gaye
 Alagh Saheb appeared to be an engineer by profession
 america se aakar dilli ke panchasheel park main apana baseraa banaaya or dusron ke basere ke aage garibon ko pani pilane kaa rasta khojane lage
 In the city of Delhi, started searching for places and buildings where pottery can be kept
 alagh sahab ne iske liye pani kii bhi khoj kii
 Step by step school and a neighbor promised water
 vahaan se saaf pani ko mataka sthal tak pahunchane ke liye do maaruti iko khridi or use steel kii chaadaron se banaaya taaki jang na lage
 They say that water must be clean and safe
 alagh sahab kii gaadi se hamaari mulaakaat jahaan hui thi usee chiraag dilli fliover ke neeche aath matake rakhe hai
 There are also pots near the bus stand of Asiad Road
 is tarah se unhone 8-10 jagahon par matake rakh diye
 Their only effort is to have someone take responsibility for these mats so that no one can sabotage them
 baaki kaa kaam alagh sahab kaa
 You keep drinking water and their car will be filled
 matake saath alagh sahab ko water cooler kaa bhi khyaal aayaa
 Thought it could be a safe and permanent method
 unhone chalis assi or dedh sau litre ke water cooler lagane shuru kar diye
 The cost on these comes from 30 to 45 thousand
 ye sara karcha alagh sahab khud uthaate hai
 The problem was that everyone wanted to put the cooler inside the yard
 jaise mahrauli road ke jain mandir ke bheetar lagaana padaa kyonki baahar cooler kii suraksha ko lekar sawaal paidaa hone laga
 If a tap is cut, then a sheet
 magar alagh sahab kii chintaa ye thi ki garib to pani se dur ho gaya
 Another problem was that people started carrying water in big pots, due to which the water started running out quickly
 phir kya tha, apni ejineering ke anubhav kaa istamaal kiya or water cooler kii dizine is tarah se taiyaar kii zyaada se zyaada lotaa hi nal ke neeche aa saktaa tha
 Where the water falls from the tap, made it like a cage
 soch yah thi ki pyaasa pani pikar jaae na ki koi in culeron se apana gadaa bhar le jaae
 In this way, Alagh Saheb has installed twenty water coolers in Delhi
 hansate hansate kaha ki paisa or pani donon simit he lekin mujhe yah kaam karnaa acha lagata he
 The comments aapane aisa cooler dekha he jahaan pani ke saath khalil jibran kii panktiyaan bhi likhi ho
 You will definitely enlarge this photo and read the poem
 kavita yahi kahati he ki aapke bachche aapke nahin he
 They have definitely come into this world through you, but they do not belong to you
 unki aatma, soch ye sab aapaki nahin hai
 They have their own
 vaah alagh sahab pani pite pite aise koi kavita kaa paath kara de to isse acha nek kaam or kya ho saktaa he
 Alagh Saheb living in Panchsheel Park of Delhi is a different kind of hydration
 achaanak mili is kahani ne mere bheetar apaar yakeen paidaa kar diya ki system bhale hi haraa de lekin aadmi nahin harata he
 He leaves the system and starts making his own system
 logon kii seva karne lagata he
 The story at the crossroads while returning home from Ira Singhal, who topped the IAS exam even after the physical challenges, gave the opportunity to see the world from the loot and falsehood of political parties
 iske liye alagh sahab kaa shukriya
 We did not meet, but what happened on the phone is enough
 to jor se boliye panchasheel park vaale pani baba kii jai
 Sir, i am speaking Ravish, from NDTV India
 ji, maaf kijiyegaa main hindi nahin bol paata, agar aap angrezi bol saken to
 The person who picked up the phone was old with voice
 alagh sahab se maine kaha ki sar mujhe angreji nahin aati par main angrezi samaj saktaa hum
 Both of them started talking
 67 saal ke alagh sahab apana puraa naam bhi nahin bataa rahe the
 He was hesitant to tell about his work
 mujhe acha lagata he isliye karata hum lekin publicity ke liye nahin karata
 Even after stubbornness, he did not tell the full name, but took a promise from him that your story would change the thinking of some, so they just agreed
 alagh sahab peshey se ejeeniyar maaloom pade
 After coming from America, he built his shelter in Panchsheel Park of Delhi and started finding a way to make the poor drink water in front of others
 dilli shahar main aisi jagah or imaaraton kii talash karne lage jahaan matake rakhe ja sakate hai
 Alagh sahib also discovered water for this
 step bai step skool or ek padosi ne pani dene kaa vaada kar diya
 To get the clean water from there to the Matka site, i bought two Maruti Eco and made it with steel sheets so that there is no rust
 unka kahana he ki pani to saaf or surakshit hi hona chahie
 We met eight Alhag Sahib in the same place where we met eight litters under the Delhi flyover
 asiad road ke bas stand ke paas bhi matake rakhe hai
 In this way they put the pottery in 8-10 places
 bas inaki ek koshish hoti he ki koi in matakon kii zimmedaari le le taaki koi todphod na kare
 The rest of the work was done by Alagh Saheb
 aap pani pite jaaiye or inaki gaadi bharti jaaegi
 Along with the pot, Alagh saheb also thought of a water cooler
 laga ki ye surakshit or sthaayee tarika ho saktaa he
 They started installing water coolers of forty eighty and one hundred and fifty liters
 in par laagat 30 se 45 hazaar tak aati he
 Algh Saheb takes all these expenses himself
 is kaam main dikkat ye ai ki sab cooler ko ahaate ke bheetar lagaana chaahate the
 Like it had to be installed inside the Jain temple of Mehrauli Road because there was a question about the safety of the cooler outside
 koi nal kaat le jaae to koi chadar
 But Alagh saheb's concern was that the poor got away from the water
 ek samasya or thi ki log bade bade bartanon main pani bhar kar le jane lage isse pani jaldi khatm hone laga
 What was then, used his engineering experience and designed the water cooler in such a way that maximum lota could come under the tap
 jahaan nal se pani girtaa he vahaan pinjade jaisaa bana diya
 The thought was that the thirsty drink should go and not someone should fill their pot with these coolers
 is tarah se alagh sahab ne dilli main bees water cooler laga diye hai
 Laughs and said that both money and water are limited but i like to do this work
 tippaniyan You have seen a cooler where the lines of Khalil Gibran are also written with water
 aap zarur is photo ko bada kar kavita ko padhiyegaa
 The poem says that your children do not belong to you
 wo aapke zariye zarur is duniya main aaen hai lekin ve aapke hi nahin hai
 His soul, his thinking are not yours
 unki apni he
 Wow, Alagh saheb, if you recite such a poem while drinking water, then what better work can be done than this
 dilli ke panchasheel park main rahane vaale alagh sahab alag kism ke jalayoddha hai
 This sudden story created a lot of confidence in me that even if the system defeats but man does not lose
 wo system ko chhod apana system banane lagata he
 Starts serving people
 ai e es kii pariksha main shaareerik chunautiyon ke baad bhi top karne vaali ira singhl ke ghar se lautate vakt chauraahey par mili is kahani ne raajnneetik dalon kii lut or jhut se nikal kar duniya ko ek sarthak najariye se dekhne kaa mauka diya
 Thank you for this
 hamaari mulaakaat to nahin hui magar phone par jo baat hui wo kaaphi he
 So say loudly, Panchsheel Park Pani Baba Ki Jai

 However, the Chief Minister remains safe

 The country is currently two to four of the same biggest danger
 iesas, al-kaayda, lashkar or jaish jaise aatankwaadi sanghathanon ne ganatantr diwas ke maukey par desh ke kai hisson ko dahalane kii khaufnak sajeesh rachi he
 The biggest ever operation to protect the celebration of Jhamuriyat (republic Day) has started in the history of independent India
 oparation sarhad se lekar shahar tak kii hifaazat kaa he
 Republic Day is to be celebrated at Rajpath Paramnaya
 lekin puraa desh is vakt hai alert par ji rahaa he
 In the last four days, 18 suspected terrorists of nefarious alliances of terror have been arrested from different parts of the country
 ginati abhi khatm nahin hui he
 National Security Advisor Ajit Doval is himself supervising the operation
 eniee kii aguai main dilli samet tamaam rajyon kii police aatankwaadiyon kii dhar-pakad main din-raat ek kiye hue hai
 In fact, security agencies suddenly got an idea of an ongoing conversation on Facebook in which a line was very strange
 wo line thi saat kalash rakh do
 As soon as this code was decoded, the entire plot was exposed
 'saat kalash rakh do' ye wo ek line thi jisane bhartiyasuraksha agenciyonke kaan khadey kar die
 By holding this line, when the investigation proceeded, then the layers of terror conspiracy were opened which shocked the whole country
 isi ke baad giraftaar kaa wo silsilaa shuru hua jisaki ginati 18 ke baad bhi jari he
 In fact, the US intelligence agency CIA had been monitoring ISIS continuously for some time
 isi ke tahat pashchimi asian deshon main iesas kii himaayat main chalane vaale fasebuk acount or telephone intercept kiye ja rahe the
 Indian agencies were also assisting the CIA in this task
 nigaraanee ke dauraan siie ne syria, iraq or hindustan samet kai mulkon main aies ke saikadon ypi adress ko trek kar liya
 Facebook and other tools were also being used with these IP addresses
 inhen main se ek kaa istemaal aies commander safi armaar urf usoof al-hindi bhi kar rahaa tha
 a conversation on Facebook was intercepted between a person named Akhlaq living in Armar and Uttarakhand
