 The central government has called the capitalists in the capital Delhi for talks in the agitation in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to demand reservation in government jobs so that an amicable solution can be found to this issue

 The meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh

 When BJP member Ramdas Aggarwal raised the issue in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ashwani Kumar said that the government would make a statement in the matter on Wednesday
 pichley ek saptaah se jari jat andolan se rail yatayaat buree tarah se prabhavit hua he
 In many areas of the northern parts of the country, protesters are sitting on rail lines, which has affected the movement of trains

 karnataka main bijepi somvaar se apane chunaav abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karne ja rahi he lekin israly main gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke saath laalkrishna adwani bhi shaamil nahin ho rahe hai
 Earlier it was announced that both these big leaders would participate in this rally
 bijepi ne in donon netaaon ke hissaa nahin lene ko koi kaaran bhi nahin bataaya he
 Voting for the assembly elections in Karnataka is scheduled on May 5
 party kii rajya ikai ke netaa haalanki pichley kaaphi dinon se kehete aa rahe hai ki raily main adwani or modi bhi shaamil honge, lekin party ke mahasachiv or bengaluru dakshin loksabhaa kshetra se saansad echen anant kumaar ne shuukravaar ko nai dilli main raily ko sambodhit karne vaale jin netaaon kii suchi jari kii, usamen adwani va modi ke naam shaamil nahin hai
 It is a strange coincidence that the list of 140 candidates for the Karnataka assembly election was announced that Modi did not attend that meeting as well
 modi chah saal baad is board main shaamil hue hai
 The absence of Modi at the first parliamentary board meeting and then not being named among those who addressed the rally in Karnataka has given rise to such political speculation that allegations of corruption, dissidents and the departure of many important leaders from the party Due to the weak state of the party in the state, Modi does not want to directly engage with the Karnataka election campaign
 is tarah kii atakalon ko shanivaar ko or bal mila jab mukhyamantri jagadish shettar ne kaha ki modi karnataka ke paanch jilon main chunavi jansabhaon ko sambodhit karenge, jabaki rajya main 30 jile hai

 donon up mahadwipi pratidwandvi tiimon ke bich yah romaanchak muqabla hone kii ummid he
 While Team India will be trying to become the first country to win two World T20 titles, the team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will have a chance to write his name in the record book by becoming the captain to win three world titles
 australia ke riki ponting or westeindies ke clive loyad aise do captain hai, jinhone apni tiimon kii aguwai karte hue do vishwa khitaab jite hai
 If Dhoni wins this trophy, it will definitely be a big achievement

 ) You know many stories of Sachin Tendulkar's life
 unke sangharsh kii dher sari kahaniyaan aapane akhabaaron-patrikaon main padhi hongi
 But there are still many such things and memories that are left out
 india today group ke 'salaam sachin' conklev main sachin ke bhai ajit tendulkar ne kai aisi hi yaaden saajha kin
 Here is his conversation with our Consulting Sports Editor Boria Majumdar
 24 saal se aap unke saath hai
 Now what will change after November 18? Sachin will not wear India's cap after this date
 yahi bahut bada badlaav he
 He has been proudly wearing this color, this cap, for the last 24 years
 uski puri jindagi cricket se hi bani he
 Every time he landed on the pitch, everyone expected a century
 bahut dabaav tha iskaa
 Now it will be over
 ab shaayad vah subah uthe, to na soche ki is bowler ko kaise khelun
 There will be some reduction in exercise
 bharpayt butter chikan kha sakegaa or media bhi uski aalochana or scrootni se bachegi
 What is the family thinking on this occasion? Mother will watch live for the first time
 donon bhai ajit or nitin, bahan sarita or patni anjali bhi stadium main hongi?sab khush hai
 Mother never even saw him practicing on the net
 local game to chhod hi dijie
 This is a special moment for Sachin
 200waan test
 The whole family will be present in the stadium
 ham sab bahut besabri se iskaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Till now we have been avoiding it
 kai dost ham par hansate hai, jab ham kehete hai ki ham sachin ko live dekhne nahin jate
 Watch his innings on TV lekin is baar live dekhenge
 Why did the family not go to the stadium to watch the match? Anjali was once watching the test in Melbourne in 2004
 sachin dak par out hue, to anjali na sirf stadium balki shahar se hi baahar chali gayi
 Why? We feared two things, even when he was scoring a lot
 ek, apana wicket phenkane kii aadat
 Second is the habit of calculus, the matter of losing patience
 ek baar rajsingh duungarpur ne papa se kaha tha ki sachin ko bolie ki car pehle gear se chalaanaa shuru kare, paanchave se nahin
 So these are all things, because of which we did not go to the stadium
 par haa, maa se bolta tha ki ab sachin khel rahaa he
 Please pray bahan sarita vrath rakhti thi
 Anjali also used to do something
 maine kuch cricket khelaa he, to main man main ye kalpana karne lagata tha ki wo acha khel rahaa he
 Is scoring isse sakaaratmak bane rahane main madad milti thi
 We all know that when a batsman reaches the pitch, there is no control over him, in such a situation the emphasis was that we should be with him emotionally, spiritually
 iskaa koi vaigyanik tark nahin he
 But we always remained around him during his batting, notably
 ateet main chalate hai, jab sachin sahitya sahavaas colony main tennis ball se khelte the or aap unhen lekar ramakant aachrekar ke paas le gaye
 To be honest, it was not thought of talent or genius then
 tennis ball se khelte the
 There were three things
 jis tarah se vah apana balla uthaata tha
 EG was backlipped
 aaj bhi he
 Not changed at all
 bahut relaxd si he
 This was the first thing to notice
 duusari cheez uske haathon kaa swing
 The ball used to be middle
 rabar ball bouns bahut karti he
 Sachin was picking the ball length very well from the same age
 in teen chizon par gaur karne ke baad mujhe laga ki use aage badhanaa chahie
 i felt that it has talent and now it needs to be pursued
 ham ramakant sar ke paas gaye
 Sachin was wearing half pants and t-shirt
 trouger bhi nahin tha
 i talked to Achrekar sir
 wo bole thik he, kal se aa jaae
 But came wearing full pants
 phir bole ki acha aayaa he, to kuch fielding practice kar le
 He took the high catches comfortably, and then returned the ball to the wicketkeeper with good anticipation
 ummid thi ki agle din wo batting bhi thik kar legaa
 Initially, some days were difficult
 use pad or gloves ke saath khilne kii aadat nahin thi
 Bat was also not a Proper
 magar phir vah jald hi ridam main aa gaya
 One day he came after the Nets
 aachrekar sar pahunche or bole ki is tarah se tumhen khelnaa hoga, aage bhi
 It was then decided that he would play at number four
 aisa ramakant sar bole
 At the beginning of his cricket career, he made headlines by hitting several Test centuries
 vah pehle miliener cricketer bane
 Money meant nothing to me
 uski centuri bani to vah milliens kamaane kii tarah tha
 If he played well then we also enjoyed walking in a rickshaw
 ran nahin bane, to faraari chalaane main bhi nahin majaa aayaa
 People can say that they made a lot of money
 magar hamaare ghar main uske ran or centuri kaa hi mahatv tha
 Today i can say in the last veela of her career
 ki international cricket main 100 se zyada shatak, pachaas hajaar se zyada ran first class cricket main
 Highest runs scored for India in three World Cups
 ab in sabake baad ham kah sakate hai ki vah hameshaa hi miliener rahenge hamaare liye
 When did Sachin board a rickshaw and taxi? We were at BMW J5
 do regular suutakes, ek handbag or ek koffin tha
 When Bandra arrived at the flyover, something went wrong
 sachin bole kuch galat chal rahaa he
 When i came out, i saw that the car was punctured
 hamaare saath security guard nahin tha us vakt
 Had to talk to each other
 subah ke 6
 It was 30 o'clock
 zyada trephic nahin tha
 We could not speak for another car
 airport par let ho jate the
 We stopped the taxi and stopped the rickshaw too
 tab sachin baahar aae
 Taxis and rickshaws were not sure
 hamen saare bagez taxi main rakhe
 Sachin was among the luggage in the taxi, and i was on a rickshaw
 airport par sab chaunke hue the
 Who has had the most memorable comment so far? Back to back two centuries against Australia in Sharjah
 jab final main centuri maari, to mere kareebi dost ne phone kiya
 His mother saw Sachin's innings
 ham live nahin dekhte the
 He said, you will not believe, Sachin played so well that my mother started crying after watching the match
 wo lamhaa baar baar yaad aata he
 You narrated the story of 1998
 1999 main world cap ke dauraan pita kaa dehanth hua
 Anjali told that she went to Sachin's room at midnight and told
 agar papa paanch minute ke liye phir se jinda ho jate to vah bhi vahi kehete, jo hamane kaha, ki waapas jaao or desh ke liye khelo
 Papa had the most impact on his career
 jaahir he ki jab vah antim sanskaar ke liye ghar aayaa, to dukhi tha
 There was also a heart attack two months before Papa's attack
 us vakt bhi mujhe yaad he bhartiya team srilanka main thi
 Father was on the bed, oxygen mask was put on
 agle din sachin ko janaa tha vahaan
 i told my father at night, tomorrow Sachin has to play
 main use nahin bataaungaa ki aapako atake hua he
 He smiled
 unhone ishaare main kaha ki thik kiya
 The next day Sachin went to Sri Lanka
 or vah hospital se hi use khelte dekh khush the
 That is why i am saying that if he was alive again for five minutes, then he would play and play
 isliye hamane use samajhaayaa or use phir se england bheja
 You guys are very strict with Sachin
 koun si pari zyada kareeb he aapke?chennai kii test pari jab bharat haar gaya or haryana ke khilaaf ranjai pari
 Personally, India arrived in Chennai despite Sachin's century from Pakistan
 vah newjiland daure se lautaa to bahut thakaa tha
 When i talked about the Pakistan tour, he said that i might not play
 meraa utsaah chalaa gaya
 He was thinking of not playing against Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis
 phir vah khelaa
 Zero was dismissed in the first innings
 chauthe din vah 20 par naabad khelkar lautaa
 India had to chase 270 runs
 pich kharaab ho chuki thi
 When he went to play, two wickets fell for 6 runs
 use apana or team kaa score badhanaa tha
 He was out at 256
 jab out hua to shatak (113) ban chukaa tha, usase bhi ahm tha ki team puri tarah sankat se ubari lag rahi thi
 But then he was so sad with the defeat that he was crying in the dressing room
 iklauta mauka tha, jab vah apana main of da match aword lene nahin gaya
 Raj Singh Dungarpur went and explained that if he does not leave now, the team will not be able to go home
 18 november kii dopaher kisi hogi
 Will the circle of many responsibilities be fulfilled? Frankly, we have never had to do anything very special for Sachin
 vah shuru se anushaasan main rahata tha
 We just had to be around him
 lekin haa, 18 november kii dopaher alag hogi
 We always thought about his cricket, it was not just his shared dream
 vah khatm ho jayega
 But it will end on a very happy note
 uske zyaadaatar sapane sach ho chuke hai or ummid he ki usne cricket audiyans ko khush rakhaa
 Two questions from the conference Ajit, for 24 years you have not gone to see Sachin's match, now will you go? Yes i will go because it will be the last time
 main ye mauka nahin chhoduunga
 My brother is playing the 200th Test
 us jagah khel rahaa he, jahaan usne cricket khelnaa shuru kiya
 Not only me, our entire family will play
 bhaaiyon main kabhi aapasi muqabla bhi ho jaataa he, aapane puraa jivan sachin ke liye samarpit kar diya
 Ever debated? We always talk about cricket
 kai baar aap chizon kii alag alag dhang se vyakhya karte hai
 Sachin is very nice
 usne hameshaa meri raay suni
 He started touring for 12 years
 usne duniya ke best bolers ko khelaa
 i never left home bas tivi par use dekha or apni raay di
 But still i used to speak and listen
 haa kabhi kabhi bahes hui, par wo cricket se jude muddon par hi hui
 There was some delay
 phir kuch der main bhul gaye or agali baat karne lage

 When Manga goes to her village for the wedding of her friend Heera (inamul Haq), she turns her attention to Sargi (ishita Dutt)

 2013 ke chunaav main unhen 49574 mat hasil hue the
 He defeated BJP candidate Bansi Lal
 jabaki is seat par congress ke amar singh tisare sthaan par rahe the
 Political experts say that the seat has more influence on the seat, so here too the BSP was successful in the last election
 haalanki, is baar sthiti duusari he
 BJP workers are working at the booth level this time
 vaise to yah seat anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit he isliye jati factor kaa yahaan par zyada asar nahin hota
 However, due to Rajput voters being in a decisive position, political parties bet on the same candidate who has more influence among the Rajputs

 china apni harkaton se baj nahin aa rahaa
 China is undergoing construction in Doklam again
 ‘ajtak’ ke haath lagi ek khufia report kahati he ki china ne doklam main 25 tent laga die hai
 China is trying to surround India from three sides
 ek ore pakisathan, duusari ore china or dakshin main maldive
 It is believed that as China stands behind Pakistan, similarly China is keeping a close watch on the worsening situation in Maldives
 ajtak ke haath lagi khufia report kahati he ki doklam main china ke mansoobey thik nahin hai
 This intelligence report of an important intelligence agency is shocking and disturbing
 khufia report kahati he ki china doklam main phir nirmaan kaary shuru kar chukaa he
 According to intelligence reports, construction work is going on in North Doklam along with West Doklam
 china ne yahaan 25 chote-bade tent laga diye hai
 Here he is gathering his soldiers
 baari bakhtarband gadiyon kii awajahi ke liye sadak nirmaan kiya ja rahaa he
 China is strengthening the road coming from Sincha La
 china ne sincha laa or doklam ke paas kai abjarveshan tower bana die hai
 According to intelligence reports, Indian agencies also saw Chinese flags mounted above these towers
 maamla isaliye kahin zyada gambhir he, kyonki jameen se hawa tak kii taiyaari china doklam main kar rahaa he
 The report also mentions that China has activated its air force in North Doklam
 assam kii taraf aane vaale ilaakon main china ne sena or rasad kii supplai badha di he
 Before summer arrives, China is busy deploying its troops in all those strategic areas of Tibet
 aise main sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya china bharat ko 2018 main march-april se pareshaan karne kaa puraa plan taiyaar kar rahaa he? jiske chalate wo doklam ke saath saath tibet main bhi apni sena kii kai brigade deploy karne main juta he
 Reports say that China has deployed 47 to 51 fighter aircraft in Tibet in the last three weeks
 disambar 2017 se ab tak china ne tibet ke gongba, troxing gonpa or chumbi vaili main 52, 53, or 54 mountain brigade ko tainaat kiya he
 Since this report is from the government intelligence agency, there are two questions
 pehla ki kya china pakistan ke baad maldive ke peeche khadey hokar doklam kii taiyaari kar rahaa he? doosraa ki kya bhutan se itar doklam ke jariye china bharat ke liye koi badi musiibat khadaa karne kii firaaq main he?jaahir he ki ye saare sawaal hai
 If China is under siege of India, then the question of PM is also legitimate in its place and the Congress questions about Doklam are also valid

 After giving three divorces, the wife herself or her close relatives will be able to file a case in this regard
 mahila adhikaar sangrakshan kanoon 2019 bill ke mutabik ek samay main teen talaak dena aparaadh he

 pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke istife kii maang kar rahe taharik−e−insaaf ke netaa imran khan or pakistani avami taharik ke taahir ul kadri apane-apane samarthakon ke sang ab ek-duusare ke saath hai
 Late Tuesday, about 30 thousand protesters broke into the security zone and entered the Red Zone
 in pradarshnakariyon ko rokane ke liye bade paimaane par bairicading kii gai thi, lekin pradarshnakariyon ne katrs or crenon ke jariye inhen hataa diya or red jone main ghus aae
 The Red Zone covers the Parliament of Pakistan, the residence of the President and Prime Minister and the embassies of other countries
 imran khan ne pradhanmantri navaj sharif ko aaj shaam tak istipha dene ke liye kaha he or aisa na hone par piem awaas main ghusane kii dhamkee di he
 Imran Khan is alleging rigging in the elections
 vahiin khabar he ki pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne kiya he ki vah kisi bhi surat main istipha nahin denge
 Nawaz has asked the security forces not to use force on the protesters
 pakistani pradhanmantri kii beti mariyam ne twit kar logon se hinsa na karne kii apil kii he
 He has said that the government is taking cautious steps and has done its best to avoid any untoward incident
 
 
 imran khan or taahir−ul−kadri apane samarthakon ko hinsa karne se roke
 Maryam said in the tweet, "the Prime Minister has told me that he has ordered the police not to use force on the protesters, because women and children are also involved in the demonstration
" bataur cardiek sarjan mujhe hameshaa yahi sawaal sunne ko miltaa haih khanpan, lifestil or hriday rog main kya rishta he? kya logon ko vastav main isaki parvaah karne kii jarurat he ki ve kya khate hai or kaise eksrasij karte hai? kya dil ko swasth rakhane ke liye cigarette pinaa chhod dena chahie?mere anubhav ke mutabik, kareeb 25 fisadi bhartiya aise hai jo aasaani se hriday rog ke shikaar ban sakate hai
 They are usually from families with a history of heart diseases
 unamem yuvavastha main hi haai lipid profile hota he yaa ve diabetes yaa hisertension ke shikaar ho jate hai, jinamein unki koi galati nahin hoti
 They do not smoke, they eat well and exercise regularly
 phir bhi, ve heart atake kaa shikaar ho sakate hai, anuvanshik rup se mili viraasat yaa unke navjaat rahane ke dauraan hi hui kuch galatiyon kii vajah se
 Due to our current knowledge, there is not much we can do to prevent heart attack in such people
 anya 25 fisadi aise bhi log hote hai jo jamkar sharaab pite hai, chimney kii tarah cigarette phunkate hai or jivan bhar junk food khate hai
 But nothing happens to them, as if they would die only by being shot
 dil ke nazariye se aise log khushkismat varrg main hai
 We are concerned for the remaining 50 percent of the people who are on the verge
 jo apane lifestil par najar rakhkar heart atake se batch sakate hai yaa kam-se-kam use taal sakate hai
 Quitting cigarettes, correct dosage, workout, yoga, meditation or whatever other advice we give is to keep this class safe
 aise log apni jeevanstyli main sudhaar laakar heart atake ko 45 varsh se badhaakar 65 varsh kii aayu tak le ja sakate hai
 i think it will be a big achievement
 prakruti rahasyon se bharpoor he
 There is also a mystery, how do we decide which person is out of the lucky 25 percent or unfortunate 25 percent or 50 percent of the people who are on the verge? The diagnostic tools we currently have are not capable of such identification
 isliye vyaavhaarik ravaiya yahi he ki har vyakti kagaar par he or use apni jeevanstyli main jabardast badlaav laana chahie
 After all, why is it important to worry about heart disease at a time when you have not become a heart patient? This is necessary because Indian people have a three times higher risk of being genetically diagnosed as heart disease than Europeans and are at risk of getting heart attacks at a very early age
 maine akasar dekha he ki bujurg pita ko dil ke oparation ke liye unka betaa lekar nahin aata, balki yuva bete kii bypass surgery ke liye bujrg pita aate hai
 Heart attack has taken the shape of epidemic

 The human body is not made to eat meat
 hamaare daant subjiyan yaa fal chabane ke liye bane hai
 Our digestive system is also not there to digest meat
 prakruti ne hamaare sharir ko tel yaa chini pachaane ke liye nahin banaaya he
 Nature knows that our body needs oil, so it has given us such fruits which contain oil
 inhen khaane se hi hamaare sharir ko paryaapt maatra main tel mil jaataa he
 Nature also does not want us to take sugar in the way we eat now, so it has given us sugarcane or such fruits which contain sugar

 Whoever looked on the streets of Indore on Monday evening just kept watching
 chhatripura thane kii police achaanak shahar ke gangavar bas stand par teen badmaashon ke saath namoodaar hui or phir unhen kuch is tarah lekar shahar ke chakkar kaatane nikal padi
 The police made three miscreants walk for two and a half kilometers and five mohallas for two hours

 Sometimes kick, sometimes shoe, sometimes slap, sometimes hit

 What did these miscreants do? 
 
 indore police ko in badmaashon kii gundgardee or adibaazi yani jabaran vasuuli kii shikaayatein lambey samay se mil rahi thim
 The police had also arrested one of these Nilesh family in similar charges many times, but Nilesh would have been released on bail each time and used to do the same work again
 lekin is baar zamaanat par baahar nikalne ke baad jab neelesh ne phir se samaajawaadee indiranagar ilaake ke kuch dukandaaron se vasuuli karne kii koshish kii, to police ne use sabak sikhaane kaa faisalaa kar liya
 As soon as the police received the report, Nilesh caught two of his associates and then took them out of the procession to the police station directly
 chhatripura thana ilaake main niklaa juluus khaaskar un muhallon se guzara, jahaan in badmaashon ke khauf or aatank se aam logon kaa jeena muhaal ho chukaa tha
 And it was also the house of one of these three accused who were arrested in a street of the same neighborhood
 or police ne is silsile main us mulzim ko gharavaalon ke saamne zaleel karne main bhi koi kor-kasar baaki nahin chodi
 At first, the police tied the three with chains and brought it to his house and rushed to the front of the house and ordered to hold the meeting again
 police kii maane to har baar kii tarah neelesh is baar bhi bilkul bemauf tha or pakade jane ke baad bhi wo sharaab ke nashe main police ko dhamka rahaa tha
 But this time, no one could even think about the work done by the police in return for this act of Nilesh
 bhare bazaar ke bich police ne naa sirf marpet kar neelesh or uske saathiyon kaa juluus nikaala, balki unheen dukaanon ke saamne lekar jaakar shikaayat karne waalon se maafi bhi mangvayi or uthak-baithak bhi karwaae
 Even after going to jail, do not threaten the complainant to weaken Nilesh and his partner Sue, they took the promise from him on the road, but in their own way - speak out loud
 
 
 or karoge?nahin karenge
 
 
 Will you let the people live in peace? Yes
 
 
 shikaayat likhavane vaale or gavaahi dene vaale ko daraaoge?nahin, nahin daraayenge
 
 
 The police, which took out a procession of miscreants with kick-punches, not only wanted to fear the law in their hearts and minds, but also did not want to let them come out for a long time after sending them to jail, but for this Indore police also found a unique way

 dilli kii satta or lok sabha kii galatiyon ko sudhaar kar unhone maafee maangi or is saal dilli vidhansabha chunaav main 67 siton ke saath badi jeet hasil kii
 It has not been even a month since Kejriwal took power
 kejariwal ne 15 janvari ko dilli ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee thi
 But the successive sting operations have raised some questions
 kejariwal par unheen ke saathi rahe gambhir aarope laga rahe hai
 1
 aap ke do bade netaa, jinhen party ke raajnneetik panel se hataa diya gaya he, yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ke patr se pataa chalaa ki loksabhaa chunaav ke baad kejariwal ne dilli main congress kii madad se phir se sarkaar bananaa chaahate the
 After this, in a sting operation, it is alleged that Kejriwal tried to sell the mlas for power
 2
 Another audio tape has come in which Kejriwal is heard saying that Muslim voters will vote in favor of AAP
 muslimon ke paas bijepi ko rokane ke liye 'aap' ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin he
 After this, Kejriwal is being accused of being anti-muslim
 3
 Regarding Kejriwal, Prashant Bhushan had said, "I believe that we should stick to our policy principles, whereas Arvind feels that compromises have to be made in politics
" ”aakhir kis raste par ja rahe hai kejariwal? ye sawaal unheen ke saathiyon ke aaropon se uthaa he, jinke jawaab chuttee se lautate hi unhen dene honge
 It is not necessary that the smoke has risen from the real fire, but it has blurred Kejriwal's image, even if it is only for a few minutes
 aisa to nahin ki logon ko sapane dikhaa kar bhartiya raajnneeti ko phir se filmi kurukshetra main tabdeel karne kii koi kavayad chal rahi he

 dakshin africa ne england ko duusare van−de main england ko 80 ran se haraa diya or is jeet ke saath hi dakshin africa van−de main bhi number van team ban gai
 The South African team has already won the number-1 crown in Tests and T20s
 isisi ke rankig ke itihaas main yah pehali baar he jab koi team cricket ke teenon formet main ek saath number van ke sthaan par kabiz he
 This is the success of Proteas in all three formats of cricket, seeing that the reign of South Africa over cricket is established
 test maichon da main africa ke 120 ank hai or vah england (117 ank) or australia (116 ank) se aage he
 At the same time, South Africa have 130 points in T20 and here they are ahead of England (129 points) and Sri Lanka (119 points)
 van-de main 124 ank ke saath dakshin africa number van par he, to 120 ankon ke saath bharat number do par or 118 ankon ke saath england number teen par khisak gaya he
 a year ago, coach Gary Kirsten made a strategy to make the team number-1 in every format and included many young and experienced players in the team
 'chokar' ke thappe se juujhati dakshin africa team ko ek champion team main tabdeel karne kaa karnama coach karston ke saath mental coach mike horner ne kiya
 Now Gary Kirsten is not happy even after becoming number one in all three formats of cricket
 vah ab is team ke saath bade-bade khitaab jeetna chaahate hai or unka aglaa mishan he srilanka main hone vaala tii−20 vishwacap or jis tarah team match-dar-match majboot hoti ja rahi he, usase ab baaki tiimon ke liye khatre kii ghanti baj gai he

 amala ne aakhri over main out hone se pehle 124 gendon par 16 chaukon kii madad se 150 ran banaae
 In the second one-day match against England, Amla also managed to beat his previous highest score of 140, which he had made against Bangladesh
 yah unka 10waan ek-divasiy shatak he or vah sabase kam maichon main 10 shatak lagane vaale ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 The comments dakshin africa ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla kiya, jiske baad amala or captain greem smith (52) ne pehle wicket ke liye 89 ran jodakar team ko acchhee shuruyaat dilaai
 Jean Paul Duminy (14) and Dean Elgar (15) did not play big innings despite spending some time at the crease
 amala ne abi divilliars (28) ke saath 65 ran or phalf du plasis (naabad 22) ke saath 55 ran kii mahatvapurn saajhedaariyaan kin
 Swann bowled de Villiers after Elgar was dismissed
 vah england ke sabase safal gendbaaj rahe
 He gave 50 do wicket liye
 This is the first time in the history of ICC ranking when a team occupies the number one position in all three formats of cricket
 cricket ke teenon formet main protiyaaj kii yah aisi kamyaabi he jise dekhakar cricket par dakshin africa kii badshahath kaayam hoti he
 Africa have 120 points in Test matches and are ahead of England (117 points) and Australia (116 points)
 vahiin tii-20 main dakshin africa ke 130 ank he or yahaan bhi vah england (129 ank) or srilanka (119 ank) se aage he
 In one-day South Africa is at number one with 124 points, India with 120 points has slipped to number two and England has slipped to number three with 118 points
 ek saal pehle coach gairi karston ne team ko har formet main number-1 banane kii ranneeti banaai thi or team main kai yuva or kai anbhavi khilaadiyon ko shaamil bhi kiya gaya
 Mental coach Mike Horner, along with coach Kirsten, tried to transform the South African team from the 'choker' tag into a champion team
 ab cricket ke teenon formet main number van banane ke baad bhi gairi karston khush nahin hai

 Whether the movement inside the Himalayas can lead to ruin in India, this question is troubling the scientists
 himalay kii halchal ko lekar chintaa badhane ke peeche baar-baar aa rahe bade bukamp hai
 Since the earthquake in Nepal in April last year, earthquake tremors have increased in Hindukush, while the recent 6 in Manipur
 7 tivrata kebukamp se hui tabahine logon ko dahala diya he
 According to scientists, this is not the last earthquake in the Himalayan mountains, yet more major earthquakes are occurring in the Himalayas
 bhugarbha vaigyanikon ke mutabik, kashmir, uttarakhand, himachal or assam main ek bade bukamp kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The great Himalayan plains and mountains can cause ruin by ever greater earthquakes
 bada khatra lekar aayega ye bukamp!enidiem ke kaaryakari nideshak santosh kumaar ne kaha, 'bhartiya himalay ke teenon hisson pashchimi himalay, madhya himalay or poorvihimalay main bada bukanpakabhi bhi dastak de saktaa he
 Based on the theory of seismic gap, scientists are anticipating a repeat of major earthquakes in Kashmir, Himalayan Kangra and Uttarakhand
 ye bukamp chota nahin balki isaki tivrata 8 se bhi zyada tej ho sakati he
 According to the plate tectonic theory, the Indian plate is colliding with the Eurasian plate and due to this the height of the Himalayas is constantly increasing
 puure himalay kshetra main kai folt jone hai or plate movement ke saath hi inamen jatke aate hai or is vajah se puure himalay kshetra main bukamp aate rahete hai
 Something similar happened during the great earthquake in Nepal
 manipur main aayaa bukamp bhi aisi hi gatividhi kaa hissaa he
 But the special thing is that there are many areas in the Himalayas where there has been a period of major earthquakes
 in ilaakon membukamp kii sambhaavnabadhi hui he
 Anticipating increased danger after earthquake in Manipur, Vineet Gehlot, director of the National Earthquake Center, said that in 1905, 7 in Kangra
 8 tivrata kaa jabardast bukamp aayaa tha
 8 in Assam in 1950
 6 kii tivrata kaa bukamp record kiya gaya
 Followed by 7 in Muzaffarabad of pok in 2005
 6 tivrata bukamp aayaa
 Recently 7 in Nepal on 25 April 2015
 8 kii tivrata ke bukamp ke baad bhi lagaataar oftersox kaa silsilaa bana hua he
 In the midst of all this, 6 on 4 January 2016 in Manipur
 7 ke pariman ke bukamp ne ashanka badha di he
 These are earthquakes in view of which it would not be wrong to say that there is a possibility of even bigger earthquake in the Himalayas
 bukamp aane ko roka nahin ja saktaa he lekin isse bachane ke liye upaay kiye ja sakate hai
 Scientists from all over the world are aware of this truth, so efforts are constantly on how to predict earthquakes correctly
 agar bada bukamp aayaa to in ilaakon kaa kya hoga?uttar bharat kaa sabase bada dar ye he ki agar bada bukamp aayaa to kya hoga
 According to experts, if an earthquake of 8 or above in the Himalayas hits the mountains of Himachal or Uttarakhand, then there will be huge destruction in the plains including Delhi
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he kibukamp kii bhavishyavaaneeto nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, prevention is the only preparation to avoid earthquake
 to kuch second main hi dilli pahunch jaaegi afat!vaigyanikon ke mutabik, bukamp aane par do tarah kii wave chalati hai
 P
 Wave and S
 Wave
 pi wave dharti ke neeche sidhe-sidhe chalati hai or es wave dharti kii sataha par chalati hai
 s Wave means the most damage from surface wave, but their speed is 4 kilometers per second
 lihaaja himalay main bada bukamp aane kii sthiti main dilli samet tamaam ilaakon ko 40 se 50 second main bukamp kii lahar tabaahi pahunchane ke liye pahunch jaaegi
 That is, there is always a danger of a big earthquake in the country
 bukamp ke aane kii sthiti main kya karen-- yadi ghaav yaa kharonche hai to praathmik upachaar avashya karaaen
 - Keep roads and lanes clean for emergency vehicular traffic
 - refricrator, tivi gas aadi ko band kar den
 - Wear shoes to protect your feet
 - transistor radio se samachar sunate rahen
 Through which information about the earthquake will continue
 - kshatigrast kshetron or buildingon ke aasapaas bheed naa lagaaein
 - Do not let the water be wasted
 isaki ati aavashyaktaa aag bujhane main hogi
 - Do not spread rumors
 isse dar or avyavashtha failati he
