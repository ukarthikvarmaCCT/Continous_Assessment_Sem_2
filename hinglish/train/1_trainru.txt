 Although the councilors are not happy with the new party stakes, they are seen standing with the party, playing discipline

 i had to do a lot of work for the public, but now the post will not be there
 phir bhi main party ke faisle se puri tarah se sahamat hum
 The party must have taken this decision only after some deliberation
 " At the same time, Councilor Sandhya Verma from ward number 12E of East Delhi said, "the party should have given tickets to at least those councilors who have done a good job
 kaatna hi tha to un parshadon kaa tikat kaata janaa chahie tha, jinka ricard kharaab rahaa he

 i believe that everyone should get a chance, if the party wants to give a chance to the youth, its decision is welcome
 " There are many councilors present who do not seem to agree with the party's decision and they took a different route

 The year 2018 was a great one for Indian wrestling, with Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat emerging as the new stars of the game with historical medals, while Olympic medalists like Sushil Kumar and Sakshi Malik struggled to find a rhythm
 pahalawaanon ke liye acchhee khabar yah bhi rahi ki saal khatm hone se pehle rashtriya mahasang lagbhag 150 khilaadiyon ko anubandh pranali ke tahat le aayaa
 This is the first time Indian wrestlers have received a central contract from the federation

 Takuto Otoguro of Japan constantly attacked his right leg, to which Bajrang had no answer
 anya phogot bahanon main ritu, sangeeta, babita or gita ke liye bhi yah saal kuch khaas nahin rahaa, lekin jis ek khilaadi ne bhartiya kushti main apni pahchaan banaai- vah he puja dhanda
 The player, who won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games, won a bronze medal at the World Championship

 Today is World Earth Day
 jo prithvi hamaara laalan-paalan or poshan karti he, aaj ham use hi apane se paidaa kiye pradooshan naamak 'rakshas' se usko saare iko system ko nasht karne par tule hai
 Several programs were organized in the city schools under the Satya Foundation in Varanasi to make this public aware and to make them aware
 saint johns skool main prithvi kii santan ped paudhe or manushyon kii santan ham-aap kaise ek hai
 Explaining this to the children, the well-known neurosurgeon doctor of the city, VD Tiwari said that as the offspring of the earth is its vegetation and tree plants, which have roots inside and stem branches outside, so is our body
 bas antar ye he kii hamaare sharir kaa jad yani mashtishk upar hota he or baaki sharir ke ang yani tana neeche
 If the head is cut off from the neck, our body becomes dead, similarly if we cut the root of the tree, the tree dies
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki prithvi mata kii santan ped paudhe or apni mata ke santan ham, bhai bahan hai
 Explaining this in a more concrete way, he said that even the trees and plants are alive, they also breathe like us, they also have pain, their tears also come out
 tippaniyan This thing has been proved by many researches
 ped paudhe jab saans lete hai to wo hamaare liye hanikaarak carbon daai oxide khud lete hai or hamen oxygen dete hai
 So they actually prove to be their brothers, whereas in return we do not see them in this sense, if we also see them in this sense then we will be able to save both the environment and the earth

 In St
 John's School, how can we be one of the offspring of the earth, plant trees and the offspring of humans? is baat ko bacchon ko samajhaate hue shahar ke jane-maane neurosrjan doctor vidi tiwari ne kaha ki jaise prithvi kii santan uske vanaspati or ped paudhe hai, jisaki jaden andar hoti he or tana shakhaaen baahar vaise hi hamaara sharir bhi he
 The only difference is that the root of our body ie the brain is up and the rest of the body part is the stem
 yadi gale se sar ko kaat de to hamaara sharir mrit ho jaataa he, vaise hi agar ham ped ke jad ko kaat den to ped mar jaataa he
 It means to say that we are siblings of Prithvi Mata, and we are siblings
 is baat ko or pukhta tareeke se samajhaate hue kaha ki ped paudhe bhi jivit hote hai wo hamaari tarah hi saans bhi lete he, unhen bhi dard hota he, unke bhi aansu nikalate hai
 The comments ye baat kai risrchon se siddh ho chuki hai
 When plants breathe, they themselves take harmful carbon dioxide for us and give us oxygen
 lihaaja wo asal main apane bhai hone kaa pramaan dete hai jabaki badale main ham unhen is bhav se nahin dekhte, agar ham bhi unhen is bhav se dekhen to ham paryaavaran or prithvi donon ko bachaa sakenge
 The children took these things seriously and on the day of Earth Day collectively took an oath that every child will plant a tree and also make people aware of it, so that our earth can be saved

 congress adhyaksh pad rahul ko saunp chukin sonia gandhi ab bhi modi ke khilaaf gathbandhan banane ke liye vipaksh kii dhuree banane kii jugat laga rahi hai
 In view of this, he has called all opposition party leaders for dinner at his house on Tuesday
 bataur congress sansadeey dal kii adhyakshasoniyaki koshish 2019 ke liye vipaksh ko lamaband karne kii he
 The leaders of 18 parties or their representatives who will attend the meetings before this dinner will be included, but SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, BSP supremo Mayawati, Trinamool supremo Mamata Banerjee and NCP chief Sharad Pawar have not agreed to join so far
 haalanki, sonia ke manager abhi bhi koshish main hai ki kam se kam pavaar or mamata hi shirkat karen, lekin abhi tak unhen safalataa nahin mili he
 However, all of them have agreed to send their representatives
 ek tir se do nishanise dinar diplomasi ke jariye sonia ek tir se do nishaanaa sadhana chaahati hai
 By calling the opposition leaders at dinner, she wants to prove that the Congress will lead the alliance formed as an alternative to Modi
 ekajute hona samay kii maangsonia gandhi kaa ek bada sandesh ye he ki vah mamata or pavaar kii tisare morche kii aguwai kii koshish ko tavajjo nahin deteen
 In such a situation, staying away from Mamta and Sharad Pawar's dinner till now is going to cause problems for the Congress
 haalanki congress maanati he ki modi ke khilaaf sabko ekajute hona hi padegaa or ye puure vipaksh kii zimmedaari he
 On this issue, Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said, "the time is right for everyone to come together, today the third-fourth Front has no meaning
" vaisecongressye samajhati he ki rahul gandhi ke netritv ko lekar pavaar or mamata jaise netaaon ko jhijak he
 That is why Sonia wants to keep the command of the coalition till 2019
 aakhir ye donon gaahe bagaahe modi virodh ke agua banane kii siyasat karte rahe hai
 Mamta's separate path is something that Congress does not like
 mamata ne tisare morche ke vikalp talashne ke liye telugana ke siem kesiar ko phone kiya tha
 TDP and TRS have refused to attend the banquet despite efforts by the Congress backdoor
 vahiin baat agar maratha kshatrap kii karen to kai maukey aae jab pavaar ne congress ko jhatka dene main kotahi nahin barti
 The efforts will continue, in such a manner, the picture of the anti-modi alliance for 2019 will continue to eat political hiccups, but due to this, the party does not want to reduce its efforts
 aakhir congress ko bhi ahsaas he ki aane vaale rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke nattejey tay karenge ki uske jhande ke neeche sabhi aate hai yaa nahin
 a new leader is born
 a leader India needs
 a leader with a new- truly Gandhian- philosophy of politics
 Politics of idealism, of love, of service, of inclusion, of dialogue
 Today I'm even more convinced: # congresspresidentrahulgandhi will, and should, become India's next PM

 19 saalon main ranking main sirf ek hi ank kaa sudhardesh ke godaamon main 1150 metric ton anaaj rakhaa haidesh main anaaj ke godaam bhare hai
 There is a lot of food stuff
 lekin iske baavjood hamaara desh vaishvik bhukh suchakank (global Hunger Index) main 117 deshon kii ranking main 102wein sthaan par he
 India is in such a bad condition that it lags behind even smaller countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh
 is ranking main bangladesh 88 or pakistan 94 number par he
 Whereas, in the year 2000, India's ranking was 103
 yani 19 saalon main sirf ek ank kaa sudhaar hua he
 Every day about 19 crore people in the country go to bed hungry
 yani unhen bharpoor khaanaa nahin miltaa
 Whereas, on 16 July 2019, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs in the Lok Sabha, in response to a question, said that 1150 metric tonnes of food grains are still kept in the godowns of the country
 aakhir itnaa anaaj hone ke baavjood bharat kii global hangar index main ranking itani kharaab kyon he?hangar index: sibbal kaa waar- ‘modi ji raajnneeti par kam, bacchon par zyada dhyaan den’pehle ye jaananaa jaruri he ki hangar index kaa paimaana kya hota he?global hangar index kii suchi main maujuud deshon kii sthiti ko chaar paimaanon par mapa jaataa he
 On the basis of these parameters, the rankings of countries around the world are determined
 1
 Malnutrition malnutrition means that people do not get as many calories as they need every day due to lack of food
 nateeja ye ki log kuposhit rahete hai
 About 19 crore people in India are malnourished
 neshnal family health survey-2015-16 ke anusaar desh main 15 se 49 saal kii 22
 9 percent women and around 37 under five years of age
 05 fisadi bachche kuposhan ke shikaar hai
 However, there is abundant storage of food grains in the country's warehouses
 nagarikon ko bharpayt khaanaa nahin khilaa paa rahaa bharat, hangar index main pakistan-bangladesh se peeche2
 The weight of children in the ratio of length is called child vesting
 yani lambaai ke anupaat main bacchon kaa vajan kam hona
 According to a report presented in the Lok Sabha, around 20 under the age of five in India
 8 fisadi bachche apni lambaai ke anupaat main kam vajan ke hai
 This is a very worrying situation
 3
 The decrease in length in proportion to age is called child stunting
 yani umr ke anupaat main bacchon kii lambaai kam hona
 According to the National Family Health Survey-2015-16, 37 under five years of age in the country
 9 fisadi bachche apni umr ke anupaat main kam lambaai ke hai
 Hungry people of India
 
 
 kuch kaa zikr hua kuch ko to yah bhi naseeb na hua4
 Infant mortality is the child mortality rate ie how many children survive after the birth of a thousand children
 desh main paanch saal se kam umr ke bacchon kaa mrityu dar prati hajaar 48
 Is 77
 yani desh main paidaa hone vaale har 1000 baccho main se 48
 77 children die

 Between 2016 and 2017, 8600 tonnes of food grains went missing
 ab anaaj kharaab hone kaa aarope lagata he chuhon, keedon or barish par
 But are there such arrangements in these godowns that can keep the grains safe? It is true that the grains have to be kept for disasters and emergencies, but what is the standard of their safety
 ek anumaan ke anusaar sarkaar ke laaparvaahee se pichley 10 saalon main sarkari godaamon 7
 8 million quintals of grain rot

 This is a secret police memo dated May 1946, which mentions a letter
 yah chitthee netaji kii patni emili shenkal ne vienna se netaji ke bade bhai sarat chandra bose ko bheji thi
 However, the bottom of this letter is torn, which has led to questions whether Netaji's wife believed that he had died in a 1945 plane crash? is chitthee kaa nichalaa hissaa fata hua he, haalanki isse aisa sanket miltaa he ki subhash chandra bose kii patni bhi maanati thi ki netaji kii maut ho chuki he
 But it also raises the question whether someone deliberately tore the letter in this way

 The comments vah kehete hai, 'asal main us police memo main kaha gaya he ki us chitthee main unhone (shenkal ne) khud ko bose kii vidhwaa bataaya tha or kaha tha ki vah vimaan haadase main netaji kii maut se sadame main hai

 The bottom of the letter is torn, though it indicates that Subhash Chandra Bose's wife also believed that Netaji had died
 lekin yah bhi sawaal uthta he ki kya kisi ne jaanboojh kar chitthee ko is tarah phada tha
 The author, historian and patriarch of Ashoka University, 'nehru and Bose: Parallel Lives', Rudrashu Mukherjee, however, does not believe so
 tippaniyan He says, 'actually in that police memo it is said that in that letter he (shankel) had described himself as Bose's widow and said that he was shocked by Netaji's death in the plane crash

 com / aiuvlq0ftj— BJP (@ bjp4india) May 7, 2018 The Prime Minister will rally in Karnataka on May 8-9
 aath taarikh ko pradhanmantri vijayapura, bangaleru main raily karenge
 On the 9th, he will address the rally in Kolar, Belagavi and Bidar
 aapako bataa den ki pradhanmantri ne 1 may ke karnataka main chunaav prachaar karnaa shuru kiya
 Since then, he has been associated with the Karnataka elections
 jis din pradhanmantri raily ko sambodhit nahin karte hai, us din ap ke jariye kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hai
 Earlier, PM has addressed the Kisan Morcha, Mahila Morcha and the candidates of the state through the Namo app
 kitni kargar namo ap?aapako bataa den ki abhi tak ye ap 1 karod se adhik logon ne downlod kiya hua he
 Whenever PM Modi interacts with party workers through the app, about 2 lakh to 2 on that day
 5 lakh log ap ko downlod karte hai
 According to BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya, over 20 lakh people have downloaded the app in the last three months
 modi 2012 or 2014 main 3di screen ke jariye ek saath sau se zyada jagahon par chunaav prachaar karte the
 Before the 2019 elections, PM Modi has drawn a new line from this technology of publicity in Karnataka through the app

 adhiktar log yogasana tathaa vyaayaam donon ko ek hi samajhate hai parantu aisa nahin he
 These two have their own importance
 yoga sirf ek kasarat nahin he
 In the workout you do only physical process but in yoga you do physical, mental and emotional process
 yogasana sharir kii sthirataa ko banaae rakhata he jabaki vyaayaam sharir kii gatishiltaa ko badhaata he
 Let's know that in inter-exercise in yoga and exercise (exercise), you do not pay attention to your breath and the breath becomes very fast
 yoga main saanson par santulan sikhaaya jaataa he or asana ke aadhaar par saans leni hoti he
 Yogasana has more effect on internal organs
 jabaki vyaayaam se sharir baahar se balishtha dikhaai detaa he
 The body remains flexible due to yoga asana while exercise causes muscle stiffness
 eksrasij tivrata or prabalata par jor detii he, jisase mansapeshiyon ko nuksaan bhi pahunch saktaa he
 Yoga is done at a slow pace and increases stamina
 yoga se mansapeshiyaan kamjor nahin hoti hai
 Exercise increases digestion power, which increases appetite and the person eats more
 yoga se pachan shakti dhire hoti he jisase bhukh kam hoti he or insaan kam khaane lagata he
 Exercise quickly consumes energy which makes you tired
 yoga karte samay urja dhire dhire kharch hoti he jisase aap thakte nahin balki taro taaja mahasoos karte hai
 For exercise you need enough space and equipment but for yoga you only need a mat and a little space
 eksrasij karte samay aapako apana dhyaan kendrit nahin karnaa hota
 While doing yoga, you have to focus on your breath and easy, which increases awareness of the body
 yoga se maansik shakti badhati he tathaa indriyon ko vash main karne kii shakti aati he
 There is no principle in exercise while yoga is based on five principles: right food, right thinking, right breaths, regular exercise and rest
 eksrasij har umr kaa insaan nahin kar saktaa jaise kii vruddh yaa biimaar vyakti
 Yoga can be done by people of all ages
 biimaar insaan bhi kuch aasaan saanson kii kriya kar saktaa he

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 global or google kaal ne hamaari jaagrukta ko kis had tak behatar kiya he yaa badtar kiya he isaki ek misaal he gaaza par israeli hamale ko lekar hamaari udaseenta
 The channels have just entered the anti-muslim statement of Ashok Singhal originating from the Vedic period
 par kab local behatar the or kab global iske liye aapako do prakaar ke time zone yani kaal khand main le chalata hum
 That was when there were no 700 news channels and millions on Twitter did not follow a leader
 maheenaa yahi tha july kaa magar saal tha 1936
 India was fighting for its freedom
 july 1936 main elahabaad main philistin conference bulaai jaati he jisamen hissaa lete hai, ram manohar lohia, jepi kriplani or shaukat ali jaise kai bade netaa
 This year, Congress celebrates Palestine Day in every district of UP to show brotherhood towards Palestine
 sochiye itawa, saharanpur main philistin diwas man rahaa tha or aaj kahin koi harakat nahin dikhti he
 The Congress was then pressurized to take on the question of Palestine in the same way as the Congress took the line against the end of the Osmania Empire in Turkey and the humiliating agreement
 tab ke netaaon ne khilaafat ko, na philistin ke sawaal ko, hindu muslim angel se dekha tha
 Among those who supported the Khilafat were leaders like Lala Lajpat Rai and Madan Mohan Malviya
 balki tab is baat kaa khyaal rakhaa gaya ki philistin ke samarthan ko yahudee virdohi na dekha jaae, magar is baat ne congress ko har saal philistin par prastaav paas karne se kisi ne nahin roka
 Mahatma Gandhi said on the question of Palestine, Palestine belongs to the Arabs, as England is to English, France to French
 arabon par yahudiyon ko thopanaa galat or amanviya he
 Now come to India in July 2014
 aaj bharat ke tamaam shahar khamosh hai
 There is no leader who can divert the attention of the country to this by stopping his daily demonstrations
 yahaan tak ki hamaari sansad bhi is masale par mahaz charchaa ke liye ek aam sahmati nahin bana saki
 On Wednesday, the discussion on Gaza was listed in the Rajya Sabha, but External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj wrote to the Chairman that this discussion is not acceptable under any rules nor is it desirable or not desirable
 vipaksh ne hangaamaa kiya or rajyasabha kii kaarywahi sthagit ho gai
 On Thursday, the Speaker said that Leader of the House Arun Jaitley has requested that the discussion be postponed
 tab vipaksh ke sadasyon ne phir hangaamaa kiya or kaha ki ek baar koi charchaa list ho jaae to vah sadan kii sampatti ho jaati he
 It is unconstitutional to do so
 lihaaza hangaame ke baad rajyasabha sthagit ho gai
 On Wednesday, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj makes a statement that we have diplomatic relations with both countries
 kisi mitra raashtra ke prati kisi bhi prakaar kii ashisht tippanee unke saath hamaare sambandhon par asar daal sakati he
 But Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement in front of BRICS leaders in Brazil seems quite different, rather different from Sushma Swaraj's statement
 mangalvaar ko bricks ke paanchon mulkon ne gaaza par isroyal ke hamale kii ninda kii he
 There Narendra Modi said that there is a period of conflict and boom in areas ranging from Excellence to Afghanistan to Africa
 gambhir asthirataa paidaa ho rahi he or ham sab par asar pad rahaa he
 The countries of the country are getting wired
 hamaare mook darshak bane rahane se khatarnaak parinaam ho sakate hai
 Then what is afraid to discuss
 1936 ke uttar pradesh main philistin diwas manaa tha or ham 2014 ke rajya sabha main philistin ke gaaza par hamale ko lekar ek din kii charchaa nahin kar sake
 On 8 April 2003, our Parliament unanimously passed a resolution against the US invasion of Iraq

 The people of Israel are seated in a chair and clap after listening to the bomb blasts on Gaza
 ffp kii aisi tasviren duniya ke kis akhbaar main nahin chhapi hogi
 The picture reached the world with the tweet of a Dutch journalist in which people are enjoying the bombs falling on Gaza while drinking hookah while eating popcorn
 das din se israel gaaza par hamale kar rahaa he
 Gaza, with a population of eighteen million people, is surrounded
 1370 ghar tabah ho chuke hai
 Majority of the population has been deprived of electric water
 230 log maare ja chuke hai
 There is also a large number of children who die
 skulon ko dhwast kar diya gaya he
 Hospital handicapped centers have been attacked
 aaj ke di hindu akhbaar main trinity kalege ke professor vijay prasad ne likhaa he ki israel hamaas naam ke aatankwaadi sanghathan kii sazaa puure gaaza ko nahin de saktaa
 It is also wrong by international law to accept Gaza as Hamas and to blame the entire population for Hamas
 9 july ko israel ke dipti spikar ne philistini mul ke teen saansadon ko apane kamare se nikaal diya
 Said that electricity should be cut off in Gaza so that its hospital is paralyzed
 israel kah rahaa he ki jab hamaas maut kii samskruti par chal rahaa he to uskaa jawaab bhi maut hi he
 Hamas denies that he kidnapped three Israeli teenagers, after which the latest Hamala began
 sanyukt raashtra ke mahasachiv baan kii moon kaa bayaan he ki gaaza is vakt churi kii dhar par he
 On July 10, the Security Council met
 america ejipt sab sijafire kii maang kar rahe hai magar israel kisi kii nahin sun rahaa he
 Is the BJP or Modi government opposing the discussion due to its close ties or trends with Israel
 kya bharat israel ko naaraaz karne kaa jokhim uthaa saktaa he

 navaratri shuru hone se pehle vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) ne mangalvaar ko gujarat main rihaayshi socytiyon main hone vaale garba kaaryakramon main musalamaanon or isaayiyon samet gaiyr hinduon ko nahin aane dene kaa nirdesh jari kiya he
 The organization said that its volunteers at Garba sites across the state will keep a close watch on whether non-hindus are trying to enter these sites
 vihip ne kaha ki jo bhi musalmaan garba kaa anand uthaanaa chaahate hai, unhen kaarykram sthal par hindu dharm ko gale lagane kaa vikalp pradaan kiya jayega
 Gujarat VHP general secretary Ranchod Bharwad said that the ban on non-hindus would apply only in small garba programs organized in residential societies and not in clubs and other commercial events
 tippaniyan "we warn all non-hindus across the state, whether Muslims or Christians, to refrain from entering Garba sites," he said
 aise hindu tyoharon kaa muslim yuvak hamaari ladakiyon ko fansaane ke liye aujaar ke rup main istemaal karte hai
 Such prohibition is necessary to prevent the incidents of love jihad
 unhone kaha, lav jihad ke alaava, yah bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga ki navaratri hinduon kaa paavan dharmik tyohaar he
 Thus, it is not appropriate to encourage others to be part of it
 hamaari ore se kadam uthaae jane ke alaava ham socytiyon ko apane str par is pabandi ko lagu karne ke liye raji karenge
 When Dharwad was told that the Prime Minister talks about 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', what is the relevance of this directive, he said that Navratri is not a government program

 unhone kaha, ham rajyabar main sabhi gaiyr hinduon chaahe, ve musalmaan ho yaa isai, ko garba sthalon par pravesh karne se parhez karne kii chetavanee dete hai
 Such Hindu festivals are used by Muslim youth as a tool to trap our girls
 aisi pabandi lav jihad kii ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye jaruri he
 He said, apart from love jihad, it is also to be noted that Navratri is a sacred religious festival of Hindus
 is prakaar, dusron ko uskaa hissaa banane dene ke liye utsahit karnaa uchit nahin he
 Apart from taking steps on our behalf, we will persuade the societies to implement this ban at our level
 jab dharwar se kaha gaya ki pradhanmantri 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' kii baat karte hai, aise main is nirdesh kii kya praasangikta he, unhone kaha ki navaratri koi sarkari kaarykram nahin he

 After the government announced the ban on demonetisation, there was no toll collection at toll points across the country from November 9 to December 2, due to which private toll operators suffered a lot
 ab enechaeai ne nuksaan bharpai ke taur par privet toll operataron ko 922 karod ke bhugtan kaa faisalaa liya he
 The comments notebandi ke baad 22 din toll naakon par gaadiyaan bina toll die nikalati raheen
 The proposal has now been sent to the Economic Committee of the Cabinet
 enechaeai ko dar he ki agar unhone nuksaan kii bharpai nahin kii to toll sanchaalak unke khilaaf court bhi ja sakate hai kyonki enechaeai or toll sanchaalkon ke contract kii ek shart he ki agar sarkari faisle se agar in toll sanchaalkon ko nuksaan hoga to uski bharpai enechaeai ko kerani hogi
 But after this decision, toll operators will not suffer
 is nuksaan kaa hisaab enechaeai ne toll naakon par oktober kii ausat vasuuli ke mutabik lagaaya he
 These payments will be made to a total of 317 private toll operators
 asal main nuksaan lagbhag 1200 karod kaa hua lekin enechaeai pipipi model ke tahat 922 karod kaa hi bhugtan karegaa
 Trains continued to run at toll points 22 days after demonetisation
 ye prastaav abhi cabinet kii aarthik cameti ke paas bheja gaya he
 NHAI is afraid that if they do not make up for the loss, the toll operators may also go to court against them because there is a condition of the contract between the NHAI and the toll operators that if the government decision damages these toll operators then it will be repaid to NHAI Have to do it
 lekin is faisle ke baad toll sanchaalkon ko nuksaan nahin hoga
 NHAI has accounted for this loss according to the average October recovery on toll points
 ye bhugtan kul 317 nijee toll sanchaalkon ko kiya jayega
 Actually the loss was about 1200 crores but NHAI will pay only 922 crores under PPP model
 is nuksaan kaa hisaab enechaeai ne toll naakon par oktober kii ausat vasuuli ke mutabik lagaaya he
 These payments will be made to a total of 317 private toll operators
 asal main nuksaan lagbhag 1200 karod kaa hua lekin enechaeai pipipi model ke tahat 922 karod kaa hi bhugtan karegaa

 One such incident has come out from Jalandhar's Civil Hospital in Punjab, which will once again lift your trust from government hospitals
 is aspataal main ek navjaat bacchee kii jaan isliye chali gai kyonki bacchee ko paidaa hone ke baad life saport system par rakhaa gaya tha lekin is system kii 200 rupee fees bacchee ke mata−pita jamaa nahin kara paae jisaki vajah se aspataal prashasan ne bacchee ko life saport system se hataa diya or bacchee kii maut ho gai
 The comments bacchee ke pita sanjeev kaa kahana he ki vah dihadi majdoor he isliye uske paas us vakt paise nahin thesh usne aspataal main maujuud logon se bhi madad kii guhaar kii lekin kisi ne bhi uski madad nahin kii
 Sanjeev says that his child has not died but the hospital administration has killed him
 vahiin aspataal ke esemo mahindar singh ne isamen aspataal kii jimmedaari hone se inkaar kar diya he or ab vah maamle kii jaanch karaane kii baat kah rahe hai
 Actually, this is the reality of our development
 kanoon banane vaale log jidipi or vikaas ke arabon−kharbon ke aankadon main uljhe rahete hai or jamini hakeekat ye he ki 200 rupee ke liye ek navjaat bacchee kii jaan chali jaati he
 The child's father Sanjeev says that he is a daily wage laborer, so he did not have money at that time
 He also requested help from the people present in the hospital but no one helped him
 sanjeev kaa kahana he ki uske bachche kii maut nahin hui he balki aspataal prashasan ne uski hatya kii he
 At the same time, SMO of the hospital, Mahinder Singh has denied responsibility of the hospital in this and now he is talking about getting the matter investigated
 darasal, hamaare vikaas kii hakeekat yahi he
 Lawmakers are entangled in the billions of trillion figures of GDP and development, and the ground reality is that a newborn girl dies for 200 rupees

 bhartiya haikar anand prakaash ne america cab sarvice ubar kii badi khami ujagar kii he
 For this, the company has rewarded him
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab is haikar ko bounty di gai he
 Earlier too, Uber has received rewards from big companies like Facebook including Uber
 ubar se ab tak inhen lagbhag 26 lakh rupee mili hai
 This is given to them under the Uber bug bounty program
 is baar unhone upar ke internal ap kii khaamiyon ko dhundha he
 Many third party apps like Tapjo and Easy Go, you can book Uber ride through these apps
 petm kii sarvice acces kar sakate hai
 These are the kind of platforms that serve as one stop shop
 iske liye ubar in third party eps ko ek password detaa he jise yuj karke voubar acceskarte hai
 That is, Uber uses it by bringing it on its platform
 anand prakaash ne ubar ap ke jariye in third party eps ke plateform par ubar dwaara jari kiya gaya password dhund nikaala
 This matter is very serious and it is also very difficult
 anand prakaash ne aaj tak tech se khaas baatcheet main bataaya he ki unhone is khami ko october main hi report kiya tha
 After this, Uber asked them not to tell it to anyone and also believed that this is a serious problem and it is being fixed
 pichley hafte ubar ne sabhi developers ko jo ubar ap apane plateform par yuj karte hai, unhen email ke jariye password badalane kii salaah di or bade developers kaa password khud se badla he
 Due to this serious flaw, a hacker could tamper with those apps by taking the password of third party apps through the Uber app
 aapako bataa den ki aapse colect kii gai jaankariyon kaa kuch hissaa aapaki ijaajat se ubar third party eps plateform ko bhi detaa he
 For example, you can take apps like Tapzo
 kul mila kar ye he ki agar koi havers inkaa password paa le to un eps ko aasaani se manipulett kar saktaa he
 Since the case was about stealing passwords, an attacker could easily get his server token by connecting his account to Uber app
 ise client sikret kaha jaataa he
 Uber has corrected this flaw by deleting its data from the API
 anand prakaashan ne 5 october ko is khami ke bare main ubar security team ko bataaya
 On the very next day, Uber's response came and it was said that they are telling the developers about this and preparations are on to fix it
 8 farvari ko ubar ne anand ko 5,000 dollar (lagbhag 3 lakh 56 hajaar rupee) bataur inaam diya or iske baad is maamle ko public kiya gaya

 1
 The telecast of the films 'nayak' and 'suryavansham' on Set Max We have become accustomed to watching the films 'suryavansham' and 'nayak' on Indian set Max
 ipel kii krupa se saal ke bas do maheene aise hai jab tivi kholane par in do filmon ke darshan durlabh ho jate hai
 Well Max is not alone in this list
 bi4you par film 'van tu kaa four', ji cinema par film 'ham aapke hai koun', star gold par film 'wonted' or 'dabang' bai difolt chalate rahete hai
 2
 ham 'indian standard time' se chalate hainchahe aap koi party rakh lo, yaa ahm meeting, aapke guest or ko-works time par pahunch jaaen to ho saktaa he aapaki ghadi fast chal rahi he
 And if you also ask the reason for late latifi by mistake, then placing the blame on the traffic of the city is also the common answer of the common man
 3
 'where we stand, the line starts from where' Amitabh Bachchan spoke this line in the film
 tha to ye bas ekar doylog
 But in reality it has become the way of living for us Indians
 bhandare kaa prasad lenaa ho, yaa college main pariksha kaa form jamaa karnaa ho
 If you have to take tickets from the cinema hall, or visit the temple, if the police do not show their sticks, then there is every chance that there will be riots on such occasions
 kabhi kabhi to ye shodh kaa vishay bhi ban jaataa he ki aakhir line shuru kahaan se ho rahi he
 4
 
 
 
 
 system hi kharaab he'
 
 
 
 system hi kharaab he', 'is sarkaar kaa kuch nahin ho saktaa', 'saare netaa bhrasht hai
 
 
 'whatever the problem may be, the reason is counted just like this
 shahar main bukamp aa jaae, sadak par kutta mar jaae, kisi ladki kaa rape ho jaae yahaan tak ki koi baccha class main fail ho jaae, in sabaki jimmedaar sarkaar he
 This is amazing talent among us Indians
 galati kisi kii bhi ho, kami jo bhi ho, gum phir ke baat sarkaar tak pahunch jaati he
 We citizens do not have any responsibility
 5
 Bargaining is our birthright, whether to go to Sabji Mandi and buy carrot-radish or take a laptop from expensive show room, even when dowry is a transaction, bargaining starts as soon as possible
 alam ye he ki phicsad price shop main bhi ' bhaiya thik thaak daam laga lenaa
 'as the request goes
 dukandaaron ko bhi bura nahin lagata
 They are also Hindustani, they are used to it
 6
 Here, street mechanics / jugaad technology solves every problem, that is the mode of engineering which has no training
 upar vaale ne har bhartiya kaa production is in bilt quality ke saath kiya he
 Milk breaks out in the house, the middle road car tire breaks, the sandal breaks on the way, or you have to watch TV without cable connection, we Indians have every problem
 kaam karne ke sahi tareeke ko follow kiye bina, kaamchaalau kaam kar lenaa jugad kehalaata he
 And from time to time, we keep on displaying the power of this innovation
 7
 All Indians Are My Brothers and Their Sisters! This idea gets reflected in the boys' minds during school days
 bhale hi mahila suraksha par aawaaj buland karne vaale ladke ise ittefaq naa rakhen, lekin ladkiyaan isaki aadi ho chuki hai
 8
 garmiyon main power katjis din garmiyon ke mausam main kisi bhi shahar main aadhe ghante ke liye bhi bijli naa gul ho, us din ham kirtiman kaayam kar lenge
 In the name of load shedding, power is sometimes cut off as a technical fault
 dilli sarkaar to ab power cat hone par bill main discount dene tak kii baat kah rahi he
 9
 thand ke mausam main trainon kii letlatifiund ke mausam main paisanger train kii to chhodie janaab, express train bhi khun ke aansu rulaa detii he
 When the train will arrive, when it will open and when you will reach your destination, it is a sin to think about it
 train main baithne ke baad aapkaa safar mangalamay hoga yaa nahin isaki guarantee nahin he
 But the train can also be canceled a few hours before the journey, there is complete guarantee

 The petitioner said that it was a personal case of Kejriwal who could not present any bill in his favor, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia are relieved in the case of petitioner Pradeep Mittalsarkar misuse of money
 dilli kii rouj avenue court ne aam aadmi party (aap) ke donon netaaon ko raahat di he
 Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia were accused of paying fees to lawyer Ram Jethmalani from the state exchequer in a defamation case
 ram jethmalani ko jis cese ke liye niyukt kiya gaya tha wo nijee cese tha lekin kejariwal or sisodiya ne jethmalani kii fees sarkari khajaane se di
 The complainant in this case is RTI activist Pradeep Mittal
 unhone court main daleel di ki ye maamla ek tarah se bhrashtachar kaa he
 What is the matter? Actually, RTI activist Pradeep Mittal had filed a review petition in the court saying that in the defamation case done by Arun Jaitley on Kejriwal, senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani was appointed by Kejriwal at government expense
 yachikakarta kaa kahana tha ki yahkejarivalka personal cese tha
 In such a situation, how can the fees given to the lawyer be paid from the government expenditure
 soshal media or tivetor handle par yah baat kahi gai ki arvind kejariwal ne arun jetali ke khilaaf apana manahani kaa mukadmaa ladane ke lieram jethmalaniko kareeb chaar karod rupye sarkari kharche se die
 Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia's counsel had told the court that no fees of any kind have been paid to Ram Jethmalani
 unhone kejariwal ke liye yah cese free main ladaa tha
 The lawyers appearing for the defense told the court that when Arun Jaitley filed the Kejriwal Parmanhanika case, Jethmalani had given a statement that he would fight Kejriwal's case without taking money
 isi bayaan ke maddenjar kejariwal ne apana vakil jethmalani ko niyukt kiya tha
 In such a situation, there is no basis for this petition
 lihaaja ise khaarij kiya janaa chahie
 The petitioners, who have been dismissed earlier, also failed to present any such bill in the court to prove that Kejriwal and Sisodia used government funds to pay fees to Ram Jethmalani
 court ne bhi inhen sab chizon ko aadhaar banaate hue kejariwal or sisodiya ko is maamle main raahat dete hue yachikakarta kiyachikako khaarij kar diya
 The court had earlier rejected the petitioner's petition in this case

 a year later, Lalu failed to make Ritlal a candidate in the Legislative Council elections as he had to leave Patna seat for the alliance partner Janata Dal (U)
 lekin argedy mahasachiv ne lalu ke khilaaf baghawat kar di or nirdaleey ke taur par ladate hue jeet darj kii
 The results of the Legislative Council elections have been announced on 10 July
 udhar don se rajaneta bane or vidhaan parishad ke sadsy hulas pandey haalanki itane bhaagyashaalee nahin rahe phir bhi unka plan bi reetlal ke mukaable zyada majboot tha
 When the JD (U) refused to give the ticket to Araj from Bhojpur district to RJD candidate Radha Charan Seth, he joined the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) of Ram Vilas Paswan, changing his loyalty
 lekin hulas phir bhi apni seat bachaane main naakaam rahe
 Ritlal's exit from the RJD and independent MLC Hulas Pandey's departure with the LJP testifies that after the re-emergence of Nitish and Lalu's friendship, the space for criminal-turned-politician-turned-musclemen in Bihar is shrinking
 darasal, donon netaaon ne narendra modi kii bijepi ko rokane ke liye haath mila liya tha
 Since 2000, both the leaders, Nitish and Lalu, who hold the highest stature in the scattered and broken political plank of Bihar, have been given the necessary strength
 ek varisht jedy(you) netaa kehete hai, ''kai bahubaliyon ne apane maujuuda bos ke liye apni upyogita kho di he
 After all, neither Nitish nor Lalu need musclemen to fight each other
 '' abhi to bilkul nahin
 Bahubalis have always played an important role in assembly elections
 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle nitish ne hatyaropee or purv saansad anand mohan kii maa kaa aashirwad lene unke pushtaini ghar kii 'soshal visit' kii thi
 Lalu also spent hours in Siwan jail with the then convicted former MP Mohammad Shahabuddin
 vahiin is baar kareeb teen maah baad hone vaale 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ko lekar nai soch ubhari he
 It is believed that Lalu and Nitish do not have to convince the Bahubalis, because after joining together, the vote banks of these two have been organized on paper
 or kam se kam nitish ne ek bahubali kii safai karke apane matadaataaon ko yahi sandesh dene kii koshish kii he ki lalu ke gathbandhan main bhi ve sushasan ke vaade se samjhauta nahin karne vaale
 The recent arrest of JD (U) MLA Anant Singh is being seen as an attempt to shine a clean image of Nitish
 apharan or hatya ke ek maamle kii sajeesh rachane main don se vidhayak bane anant singh ke naam kaa khulaasa hone ke baad mukhyamantri ne unki giraftaar kaa aadesh de diya tha
 Appearing in court on July 2, Anant gave a sharp statement against Lalu and his two sons but preferred to remain silent on Nitish
 paswan kii algepi ke paale main jane kaa sanket dete hue anant ke ek samarthak bataate hai, ''ve sirf jedy(you) ke tikat dene se manaa karne kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 Similarly, Hulas' elder brother and Bahubali JD (U) MLA Sunil Pandey is also evaluating his options after his arrest on 11 July in the Ara district court blast case in January
 apni siyaasi jagah ke sikudde ke baad bahubali apane ustaadon ke khilaaf bhi ja rahe hai
 Lalu's former aide and expelled RJD MP Pappu Yadav is emerging as a strong force in the state
 unhone apni khud kii jan adhikaar party bana lee he or yadav samudaay ko yaa phir kam se kam yadavon ke us samooh ko apane paale main karne kii koshish kar rahe hai, jo nitish ke saath jane ke baad lalu se naaraaz ho gaya he
 Although the BJP has kept a distance from the Bahubalis who are searching for the hideout, it is being said that they are supporting Pappu Yadav from behind the scenes and strategically giving them entry into the NDA through Paswan's LJP from the back door 
 bijepi ke vaise netaa jinhone lalu ke saath gathbandhan ke baad maujuuda nitish sarkaar ko jangal raaj tu bataane kaa koi mauka nahin choda, hulas pandeya ke raturaat endie main shaamil hone par chuppi saadhe hue hai
 Hulas' Facebook page has now decorated pictures of many NDA leaders, including the Prime Minister
 algepi aakhir kyon in bahubaliyon ko panaah de rahi he or is par bijepi ne ankhen moond rakhin hai? is babat algepi ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai, ''bahubaliyon kaa hona phydemand hi rahata he
 The margin of victory in the assembly elections is usually very low and the cooperation of these musclemen can prove to be decisive
 ''saaf sandesh he ki bihar main bahubaliyon kaa daur abhi khatm nahin hua he

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati has accused all parties, including Congress, BJP, that they have been denied all rights till now by not conducting ethnic census under a thoughtful strategy of other backward class people neglected for centuries
 mayawati ne pradhanmantri dow
 In a letter to Manmohan Singh, for the educational, social and economic upliftment of other backward classes, a census has been requested on the basis of caste
 unhone anya pichhadaa varg ke shaikshanik, saamaajik evam aarthik pichhadepan ke liye sabhi vipakshi partiyon ko jimmedaar tehraate hue kaha ki ek sajeesh ke tahat inaki sahi gananaa na karakar desh ke bahut bade samaaj ko vikaas kii mukhya dhara se alag rakhaa
 This deprived the largest part of the country's population from its constitutional rights, including a large number of religious minorities
 mayawati ne kaha ki basapa ke saansadon ne sansad main sabase pehle jati aadhaarit janaganana kaa mudda uthaaya or ab anya partiyon main iskaa shrey lene kii hode machi hui he
 He said that if the other opposition parties, including Congress and BJP, were friendly to the backward classes, then in the number of times the census has taken place after independence, it would have decided to conduct a census on the basis of caste to find out the actual number of backward castes and based on these figures Induces various schemes for regeneration
 mayawati ne kaha ki aazaadee ke baad kendra kii satta main rahi sarkaron ne anya pichhade virgo ko unke sanvaidhanik adhikaron se vanchit rakhane ke liye jati ke aadhaar par janaganana jaanboojh kar nahin karaayi taaki ye log apane adhikaron ke prati jaagruk or sangathit na ho saken
 He said that since these backward classes also included a large number of religious minorities, which the governments in central power had always neglected and used as a vote bank to maintain their political dominance
 iske kaaran aazaadee ke 63 varsh ke baad bhi puure desh me anya pichde virgo kii shaikshanik, saamaajik evam aarthik sthiti main koi badlaav nahin aayaa he
 The Chief Minister said that she has been sensitive to other backward classes from the beginning and when she got the opportunity to come to power in 1995 for the first time, she independently supported the Backward Classes Welfare Department for the educational, social and economic upliftment of backward classes
 Formed
 unhone kaha ki iske saath hi in virgon ke utthan ke liye vibhinn yojanaayen sanchalit kii, jabaki purv kii sarkaron ne anya pichhade virgon ke kalyaan ke liye aisa koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya
 The political crisis has deepened following the announcement of Catalonia's separation from Spain
 spain ne catelonia kaa niyantran sidhe apane haath main le liya he or vahaan kii algaavvaadi sarkaar ko barkhaast kar diya he
 On Friday, Catalonia passed a resolution in its regional parliament and declared itself an independent country, after which the Spanish parliament passed a resolution to directly control Catalonia
 iske baad spain kii sarkaar ne catelonia kii sansad ko bhang karne ke saath hi vahaan ke raashtrapati, unke dipti, sabhi mantriyon or kshetreey police pramukh jocep louis trapero ko barkhaast kar diya
 Catalonia's separatist government was dismissed on Friday night through the official gazette
 spain ke pradhanmantri maariano rajoy ne catelonia kii sansad ko bhang karne ke saath hi 21 disambar ko kshetreey chunaav karaane kaa aahvaan kiya he yani ab catelonia ke bhavishya par puri tarah se muhar 21 disambar ko hi lagegi
 From this it seems that there is still a constitutional crisis in Spain
 catelonia cabinet ke sadasyon ko nahin diya jayega bhugtancatelonia ke raashtrapati carles puigdemont kii jagah ab purvottar kshetra main rajoy sheersh nirnayakarta ban gaye hai
 The 12 members of the Puigdemont and Catalonia cabinet will no longer be paid and if they refuse to obey the instructions, they may be accused of usurping the obligation of others
 vahiin, abhi tak catelonia ke sheersh adhikariyon kii ore se tatkaal koi jawaab nahin aayaa he
 However the Regional Police Director of Catalonia, who was sacked, has issued a statement saying that he will follow the instructions
 spain ke PM ne seenet se catelonia sansad ko bhang karne ko kaha thisase pehle shuukravaar subah maariano rajoy ne seenet secateloniake adhikariyon ko barkhaast karne ko kaha tha
 However, after declaring independence on behalf of the Parliament of Catalonia, Rajoy asked the Spanish people to maintain peace
 unhone kaha tha ki catelonia main jald hi kanoon vyavastha durust kar lee jaaegi
 It may be known that the demand for independence of Catalonia had increased after the economic recession and cut in public spending
 saal 2015 main algaavvaadiyon ne kiya tha vadaspain main saal 2015 ke chunaav main catelonia algaavvaadiyon ko jeet mili thi
 It was during this election that he promised to hold a referendum to liberate Catalonia
 saal 1977 main taanaashaahee se ubarne ke baad se yah spain main sabase bada raajnneetik sankat mana ja rahaa tha
 The referendum was rejected by the Spanish leadership
 duusari taraf adaalaton ne bhi ise rokane ko kaha tha
 Spain police also arrested several Catalonia officials over the issue
 ab maariano rajoy ne 21 disambar ko chunaav karaane kii ghoshnaa kii he, jiske baad hi catelonia ke bhavishya kaa faisla ho paaegaa
 This is the history of Catalonia
 One of the most prosperous areas of Spain, Catalonia has a history of nearly a thousand years
 spain main grihayuddh se pehle ise swaittata mili thi
 Between 1939 and 1975, Catalonia's autonomy was abolished under the leadership of General Francisco Franco
 haalanki jab franko kii maut ho gai, to catelonia ko aaazaad karne kii phir se maang uthne lagi
 As a result, the Northeast areas had to be given autonomy again in the 1978 Constitution
 iske baad saal 2006 main ek adhinium ke tahat catelonia kii shaktiyon main ijapha kar diya gaya
 Meanwhile, Catalonia grew in economic dominance and became seen as a nation
 haalanki yah zyada din nahin rahi or spain kii court ne saal 2010 main sari shaktiyaan vapal le lee, jisase catelonia prashasan naaraaz ho gaya tha

 inputah bhashaa Shah Rukh Khan is often away from controversies, but early in his career he used to react a lot to the news about himself, due to which he had to go to jail once
 unhone haal hi main david letterman ke saath ek intervyuu main ye baat kahi

 When Ramnath Kovind was a Rajya Sabha MP, he lived in this flat
 bihar kaa rajyapal banane ke baad unhone ye flats choda nahin tha
 After meeting the Prime Minister on Monday evening, Kovind spent the night in this flat on North Avenue

 That is, the grand alliance of Rashtriya Janata Dal, Congress and RLSP is seen to be failing all over
 ajtak-exis maai india kaa yah anumaan agar 23 may ko nateezon main tabdeel hota he to yah sirf mahagathbandhan kii haar nahin hogi, balki uske sabase bade partner dal argedy ko lead kar rahe tejasvi yadav kii sweekaaryata par sawalia nishaan lagayegaa
 This is also because this was the first time that the young leader Tejashwi Yadav contested without his father and Lalu Yadav, considered essential as a potato in samosas in Bihar politics
 chaara ghotaalaa cese main lalu yadav jail main hai or unhen supreme court se bhi raahat nahin mili he
 This is the reason that Lalu Yadav completely disappeared from the campaign in this election and Tejashwi Yadav took command
 ilaaj ke dauraan aspataal main lalu yadav ke saath tejasvi (file photo)apane pita ke nakshekadam par chalate hue tejasvi yadav ne jarur saamaajik nyaay ko sabase ahm mudda banaaya or bijepi par dalit-garib va alpsankhyak virdohi hone kaa aarope lagaate hue chunaav ladaa
 Apart from this, Tejashwi also contested with other non-bjp parties including Congress, but none of Tejashwi's tricks seemed to work
 aaj tak ke agsit pole kaa anumaan he ki bihar kii kul 40 loksabhaa siton main bijepi-jediu-algepi gathbandhan ko 38 siton par jeet mil sakati he
 That is, in a way, the leadership of young Tejashwi seems to have faded in front of the trio of modi-nitish and Ram Vilas Paswan
 aisa tab he jabaki tejasvi va unki maa rabari devi or bahan misa bharti ne milakar lalu yadav ko sajeesh ke tahat jail bhijwane kaa mudda uthaaya
 Apart from this, Tejashwi Yadav has been accused of stealing the mandate after fighting the assembly elections together, but the exit poll estimates are fading the impact of all political and emotional aspects
 yani agar final nattejey bhi yahi rahete hai to nishchit taur par argedy or tejasvi yadav kii sweekaaryaktaa ko lekar sawaal uthaa sakate hai
 In Varanasi, Samajwadi Party (SP) workers threw black ink on the poster of Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday after a controversy started over a slogan
 yah vivaad 'har-har modi, ghar-ghar modi' naare ko lekar shuru hua he
 Religion gurus and local intellectuals have objected to this slogan comparing Modi to Lord Shiva

 But angry SP workers threw black ink on Modi's poster on Monday

 Opposition parties have criticized the BJP for comparing Modi with Lord Shiva
 gauratlab he ki shankaracharya swaroopanand ne rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) pramukh mohan bhagwat se baat kar is naare par apni aapatti jataai thi, jiske baad bhaajapa ne kaha tha ki yah party kaa aadhikarik naaraa nahin he, balki party kaa aadhikarik naaraa 'abaki baar, modi sarkaar' he
 Modi also on Sunday appealed to activists and supporters not to use this slogan on Twitter
