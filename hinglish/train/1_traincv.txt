 However, experts are calling this the politics of pressure

 According to sources, the SP is also hesitant about an alliance with the RLG
 pashchim upi main haal ke dinon main jat samudaay or muslim samudaay ke bich bade tanaav ke maddenjar sapa muslim voton ke surakshit rakhana chaah rahi he

 telugana ke mukhyamantri ke
 a person has made an interesting demand in front of Chandrasekhar Rao
 usne mukhyamantri ko chitthee likhakar kaha he ki bazaar main uske fevorett brands kii bear uplabdh karai jaae
 Actually, the person who has written the letter does not sell favorite beer in his district
 isliye usne mukhyamantri se guhaar lagaai he ki isaki bikri shuru karai jaae
 Telangana is one of the states where alcohol consumption is very high
 yahaan sharaab pine vaale kuch log aise bhi hai jinhen mukhyamantri se apane fevorett brands kii maang karne main bhi koi hichak nahin
 The incident is from Jagtial district of Telangana

 chitthee main voter ne apana naam jaahir nahin kiya he lekin khud ko jagatiyal jile kaa nivasee bataaya he
 In the letter, it has requested to merge its existing district with Karimnagar district

 desh ke 68 wein republic de parade main rajpath par elite aatankwaad rodhi bal yani enesji ke daste ne pehali baar hissaa liya
 During the parade, a squad of 140 NSG commanders, dressed in black attire from head to fingernail and equipped with MP Five Special Assault Rifle, demonstrated their ability and efficiency at Rajpath
 in commando ne band kii dhun main nahin balki apane andaaj kadam taal karte rajpath par dikhe
 Covered in black attire from fingernail to shikha and equipped with a variety of defense armor throughout the body, the NSG commandos have the same slogan - One for all, All for one
 vastav main yah koi atiranjit naaraa nahin he
 The fact is that one commando of NSG preys on a whole gang of terrorists
 jab logon ne is elite force ko rajpath par dekha to khushi se jhum uthe
 The NSG has received three Ashoka Chakras, three Kirti Chakras, three Shaurya Chakras, 40 Shaurya Chakras, 40 Sena Medals, 16 Vishisht Seva Medals and many Excellence in Service Awards since its inception
 enesji commando ke dal ne is parade main jane maane geetkaar javed akhtar ke likhe geet par rajpath par march past kiya tha
 Vehicles specially designed to prevent hijack and vehicles used in anti-hijack operations were also demonstrated in the parade at the nsg's March Past
 blike cat commando kii khaasiyat@ 26 / 11 hamale ke dauraan enesji ne hi saxesphul oparation ko anjaam diya tha
 The successful operation was carried out by NSG in @ Pathankot attack also
 @ 1986 main gathan ke baad se aaj tak enesji commando do darjan se zyada khatarnaak opareshnon ko anjaam de chuke hai
 No one becomes an anti-terror elite commando, sweating for it @ NSG was formed in 1986
 iske liye paramilitary or sena ke best soljar chune jate hai
 @ First of all the recruits who are selected for the commandos are the best soldiers of their respective armies
 iske baad bhi unka chayan kai charnon main guzar kar hota he
 In the end, when these soldiers reach Manesar for training, they are the most precious and brave soldiers of the country
 @ chune gaye soljar main se 70 se 80 fisadi javaanon kii chatni kar di jaati he
 @ Commandos training is very rigorous
 jis tarah se civil services main chunane ke liye pehle praarambhik pariksha hoti he
 Then main exam and later interview
 kamovesh vaise hi enesji ke commandos force ke liye bhi kai charnon se guzarana hota he
 @ It is not necessary that even after reaching the training center, a soldier finally becomes a commando
 @ nabbe din kii kathor training ke pehle bhi ek hafte kii aisi training hoti he
 In which 15-20 percent of the soldiers are left to reach the final race
 commandos kaa sellection kahaan se, or kya he khaasiyatenesji kaa gathan desh kii vibhinn forcej se vishisht javaanon ko chhaantkar kiya jaataa he
 According to the information, 53 percent of the commandos in the NSG come from the army while 47 percent of the commandos come from the four para-military forces - CRPF, ITBP, Rapid Action Force and BSF
 in commandos kii adhiktam kaaryseva paanch saal tak hoti he
 Only 15 to 20 percent are kept for five years, the rest are sent back to their original forces after three years
 enesji kii sabase badi takat he, iskaa gahan prashikshan
 An SSG commando has to undergo many more times during his three years of service than an ordinary soldier does not have to undergo training in his entire service of 20 years
 enesji main bhi do hisse hai- ek he (esaiji) yani special ection group or doosraa he esarji yani special rangers group
 sags consist of soldiers originally selected from Indian armies and SRG consists of soldiers selected from various Armed Forces of India
 donon ke kaam main bhi thodaa-bahut fark he
 However, training is the same for both and when the opportunity arises, both work as an alternative to each other
 lekin aamtaur par esaiji ko un tamaam khatarnaak oparation par bheja jaataa he, jisamen maukey par hi kisi karrwai ko anjaam dena hota he
 Terrorist incidents are usually at the center of such actions
 sarkaar kii is soch ne tamaam logon or vipakshi dalon ko yah sawaal uthaane kaa mauka diya he ki ek pradesh main jahaan lakhon log bimariyon se maar jate hon


jahaan lakhon log beghar or ashikshit hon vahaan korporate soshal responsibility fund kaa itnaa bada hissaa sirf murtiyon, mandiron or dharmik sthalon ke vikaas par kharch karnaa kya jaays he yaa yah bhi kisi siyaasi agenda kaa hissaa he? Dhanteras, Kartik Krishna Trayodashi is celebrated
 mana jaataa he isi din samudr manthan ke dauraan, amrit kaa kalash lekar dhanvantari prakat hue the
 This day Dhanvantari Dev is worshiped for health protection and healing
 is din ko kuber kaa din bhi mana jaataa he or dhan sampannataa ke liye kuber kii puja kii jaati he
 On this day, people purchase precious metals and new utensils and jewelery and the main worship of Deepawali is done with the same utensils and idols etc
 dhanteras ke din kya karen or kin khaas baton kaa khyaal rakhen
 
 
 Dispose all cleaning programs before Dhanteras, do not continue cleaning till Dhanteras day
 is din keval kuber kii puja na karen, dhanvantari devtaa kii upasna bhi jarur karen
 If you want to buy metals on this day, then gold, brass and silver should be purchased
 deepawali ke liye ganesh-lakshmi kii murtiyon or anya pujan saamagree bhi isi din kray karen
 We should avoid buying iron on the day of wealth

 kunwar narayan hindi kavy paridrishy main nirvivaad rup se ekaviral upasthiti hai
 In the era of commitments and additional pressures to be politically correct, they continue their work without any noise and self-propaganda
 kavita, samaaj, jivan, mrityu, raajnneeti, darshan aadi ko lekar unke vichaar aise sulajhe hue hai ki kisi vishay par baat karte hue unhen na to kisi prakaar kii koi ulajhn hoti he or na unki bhashaa main duvidha yaa do arthon kaa koi bhay shesh rahata he
 Poetry workshop organized by University of Iowa, USA, many Hindi left and very leftist poets turned up
 kunwar ji ko jab vahaan jane kaa prastaav mila to unhen yah likhit main dena tha ki ve vampanthi nahin hai
 Kunwar ji is not really a leftist, yet he did not write in writing that he is not a leftist and refused to go to Iowa
 ek rachanaakaar se uski vichaardhaara poochna or rachana se zyada vichaardhaara ko tarjeeh dekar us aadhaar par chayan karnaa kunwar ji jaise samvedansheel kavi-man ko gavaara na hua
 So, borrowing their line, it is true: i am not neutral on the coast
 kavi or kala sameekshak vinod bharadwaj ke sampadan main kunwar narayan ke saakshatkaaron kaa ek sankalan prakashit hokar aayaa haih 'tat par hum par tatasth nahin
 'in this compilation, twenty-one interviewees have compiled interviews taken from different periods of time and on different occasions
 kunwar ji se saakshaatkaar ke liye jane vaale prashnkarta ke paas yadi taiyaari na ho, prashn unhen pehle se thodaa-bahut agar nahin bataaya jaae, to ve aamtaur par intervyuu ke liye taiyaar nahin hote hai
 This is also a bit important for the person interviewing, because after Mushaira at the Nangalib ceremony in Old Delhi, a woman journalist of a big Hindi news channel asked Nida Fazli that you write anything other than film songs? Do you know hindi-english if you are a Urdu poet? Apparently, this was enough for Nida Sahab to flare up
 labboluab yah ki kisi badi hasti se saakshaatkaar lenaa koi aasaan kaam nahin he
 In response to a question, Kunwar ji says about the poem: "kavita is the language of great love with life
 is behadi kaa or is pyaar kaa aadar karata hum, kavita inke abhaav se utpann udaasi kii bhashaa ban jaati he
 But still it remains a realization that man has a tremendous wealth
 us dhai aakhar kii yaad dilaate rahane ke liye phir-phir kavi hona changa
 This is not only a matter of sentimentality, but also a matter of great intelligence
 ''kunwar ji sahitya ke alaava film or hindustani shastreey sangeet ke gambhir rasik hai
 His comment about music is: "high quality music frees our mind from everyday pressures and creates a 'place' for ourselves
 yah 'jagah' tatkaal pradarshan ke baad bhi khaali nahin ho jaati, apni smritiyon ko basaa jaati he
 We can hear them inside ourselves until much later
 yah visheshta sangeet tak simit nahin he, sabhi mahaan kalaon kaa sthaayee gun he
 “the speed with which the transition of self-consciousness into poets these days is terrible
 ek mahaan (?) yuva kaa kunwar ji se poocha gaya ek dilachasp sawaal dekhie or us sawaal par unka behad sulajhaa hua, shaleen, magar do-took jawaab dekhieh kya mahaan lekhan ke liye rachanaakaar kaa atmamugdh hona jaruri he? ''nahin, bilkul nahin
 Rather it is important to be free
 achche lekhan ke liye jaruri he ki ek lekhak vyapak str par apane samaaj se bhi jude
 Only then can the privatization of private be expanded
 '' kunwar narayan ke saakshatkaaron kii is kitaab ko padhakar yah bilkul saaf ho jaataa he ki ve kyon bade kavi hai
 The Lok Sabha Housing Committee has issued an order to the former mps to vacate the government houses they got within a week

 siaar patil kaa kahana he ki samiti kaa chairman hone ke naate unhen bahut sari pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 So far, many former mps have not vacated the houses and the pressure of the new mps is that their houses should be allotted as soon as possible
 is saal hue loksabhaa chunaav ko bhi kai maheene biit chuke hai
 But many former mps are still frozen in those houses
 jabaki vah makaan chunakar aae nae saansadon ko dene hote hai
 That is why, taking a tough decision in the meeting of the Lok Sabha Housing Committee held on Monday, an ultimatum has been issued to all such former mps
 jo abhi tak apane sarkari bangalon par kabja kiye baithe he
 New mps who were elected in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are facing a lot of problems due to not vacating the houses of former mps
 ab in sarkari makaanon ko khaali karaane ke baad nae saansadon ko alot kiya janaa he
 But houses have to be renovated before allotting and this process also takes time
 yahi vajah he kuch saansadon ko makaan elot karne ke baad bhi vah apane apane bangalon main shift nahin kar paae hai

 Swamy said that he had sought court intervention several times during the UPA regime, but never moved the court after the NDA government came to power
 swami ne kaha, ‘sunanda pushkar ke pati bhale hi dilli main bijepi daftar ke chakkar laga rahe hon, par main sunanda kii maut ke maamle main ek janhit yachika daakhil kar saktaa hum
 'swamy has been demanding for a long time that a special investigation should be conducted in the case of Sunanda's death
 unhone is maamle main sajeesh kii ashanka jataai thi
 Last month, a team of doctors from AIIMS said in a recent report submitted to the police that Sunanda died of poisoning

 Before the death, there was a debate on Twitter between Sunanda and Pakistani journalist Meher Tarar

 To say that there is a tough fight between different parties in the five state assembly elections, but the name that is most discussed these days is that of bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 pradhanmantri pad ke liye apana naam ghoshit karwaane kii khatir party ke bheetar chali lambii ladaai do maheene pehle jeetne ke baad deshbhar main reliyon ko sambodhit kar modi puri tarah chunavi rang main rang chuke hai
 Modi's speeches show how much he is struggling to balance among the various electorate classes whom he wants to keep happy
 jab ve bina tushtikaran vaale vikaas kii baat karte hai to usamen vikaas ke bhukhe aise middle class ke liye ek sandesh chipa hota he jo aadhunik modi kii khatir samaaj ko baantne vaale modi ko nazarandaaj karne ko taiyaar he kyonki unase use ummid he ki ve dagamagaati arthvyavastha ko gati pradaan karenge
 The second message is for the radical Hindutva brigade
 8 november ko uttar pradesh ke baharich kii apni raily main narendra modi ne chunauti di, ''agle chunaav main sibiai or indian mujahidin (iem) congress ko bachaane ke liye ladenge
 Come and compete with us in public
 kaayron kii tarah chhipakar hamaari peeth par waar mat kariye
 "perhaps this is the first time that a prime ministerial candidate has compared a major political party or CBI to a terrorist organization
" raily main unhone gujarat ke gaanvon ko choubison ghante bijli dene kaa lakshya hasil karne kii charchaa bhi kii lekin unki iem vaali tippanee ko hi lambey samay tak yaad rakhaa jayega
 a BJP strategist says that whether Modi speaks his words or slips his tongue, "the message reaches where it should have reached
" ” masalan yahi tathy ki puri bijepi rahul gandhi ko congress kaa yuvaraj kahati he magar modi ke liye ve hameshaa se 'dilli sultanate’ ke 'shahjade’ hi rahe hai
 According to Modi, the Congress not only wears clothes but it also wears a 'burqa of secularism' to woo Muslim votes
 shahjada or burka jaise pratikon se modi hindutvaadi votaron ko rijhaane kii koshish kar rahe hai, vahiin shahari madhyavarg ke liye ve gujarat ke vikaas kaa danka peet rahe hai
 Modi's message to activists and over-enthusiasts is that of a Hindu leader or, in the words of a BJP leader, 'hindu Hriday Samrat'
 isliye isamen koi aashcharya kii baat nahin ki 27 aktubar ko patna kii raily main hue kai dhamaakon ke baavjood modi tathaa anya bijepi netaaon ne raily ko jari rakhaa
 Seven people lost their lives and many others were injured
 modi ne khud ko or dusron ko bhale hi khatre main daalaa ho lekin yah us mardaana or bahubali chhavi ke anuroop hi tha jise ve kai varshon se satarkatapurvak gadhate rahe hai
 Social media is full of messages and images comparing him to a lion
 reliyon or yahaan tak ki bijepi kii baithkon main bhi naaraa lagane vaali bheed 'bharat maa kaa sher aayaa’ ke naare ke saath unka swaagat karti he
 When the Bihar BJP decided to take out a journey with the ashes of the dead in Patna, Modi had to go through the ordeal to strike a balance between the need for Hindutva and his new soft image that he tried to build in his 'justice' All are appeasing through twin slogans like 'appeasement of None' and 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'
 modi ko is baat kaa ehsaas he ki jahaan kaaryakartaaon ke dabaav kii vajah se aresas pradhanmantri pad kii unki ummidavaari ke mudde par naram padaa he, vahiin chunaav agar mahangaai, bhrashtachar or vikaas jaise muddon par ladaa janaa he to unhen mahaj hindu hriday samraat se kuch adhik hone kii jarurat hogi
 In the most ideal position for the BJP, the party hopes to have a pro-hindutva polarization that will get it a majority in 2014
 bijepi adhyatksh rajnath singh ke rajnatik salaahkaar sudhanshu trivedi kehete hai, ''agar yah chunaav lahar vaala hua to vah lahar hindu rashtravaadi voton ke dhruvikaran kii vajah se paidaa hogi
 In the past, all waves have arisen due to such polarization
 ”bijepi kaa chunavi ganit is dharna par aadhaarit he ki bangladesh yuddh ke baad or 1984 kii congress vijay se lekar bijepi ko dilli main satta par laa bithaane vaale ram janmabhumi andolan tak sabhi badi lehren hindu voton ke dhruvikaran ke kandhe par hi savaar hokar ai hai
 But Modi does not want to depend entirely on one stake
 jab bihar bijepi ikai asthi kalash yatra kaa prastaav laai thi to modi ne yah suzav rakhaa ki ve raily main maare gaye logon ke liye patna main ek shoksabhaa ko sambodhit kar den
 But the BJP high command accepted the demand of the state unit
 yatra ke samarthakon kaa yah tark tha ki log isliye maare gaye kyonki ve bijepi kii raily main shaamil hone aae the, isliye unke liye kuch khaas or hatakar kiya janaa chahie
 Modi went to the deceased's house to console and met his family members
 modi apni hindutv vaali chhavi ko in dinon thodaa sanyat rakhane kii koshish karte rahe hai
 In Uttar Pradesh, he held rallies in two places, Bahraich and Kanpur (october 19), but he did not even name the Ram temple anywhere
 yah kaam unke bharosemand sipahasaalar or bijepi mahasachiv amit shah ke liye chhod diya gaya he jinhone july main party ke uttar pradesh prabharee ke rup main apane kaarykaal kii shuruyaat ayodhya ke ek daure ke saath kii thi
 Narendra Modi these days prefers the soft Hindutva outlook expected
 ve tushtikaran ke kisi aagrah se rahit vikaas purush kii chhavi par hi jor dena pasand karenge
 Bharat Pandya, an RSS leader and general secretary of Gujarat BJP, understands Modi's mind very well
 ve kehete hai, ''vikaas, garibi unmoolan or rashtriya gaurav par aadhaarit narendra modi ke nazariye ko lekar puraa sangh parivaar unke saath ekajute he kyonki aresas bhi alpsankhyak tushtikaran ke khilaaf he, na ki alpsankhyakon ke
 "therefore, at Modi's rally in Patna rally that poor Hindus and Muslims should fight poverty instead of fighting amongst themselves, no one was surprised when there was no negative response from the Sangh
 'sachhee hindu-muslim ekta’ par bolte hue modi ke bhaashanon main maharana pratap, shivaji or chanakya ke sandarbh baar-baar aate hai
 This thing keeps the radical elements happy
 devbandi muslim netaaon se baatcheet main modi unhen lubhaane kii had tak kabhi nahin gaye
 Modi's only aim is that Muslims should not vote outright against him aggressively
 modi ke muslim pratyaashee devbandi netaaon ko yah bataate rahe hai ki ve vikaas rupi kek main musalamaanon kaa hissaa bhi sunishchit karenge lekin yah bina kisi khaas tavajjo ke hoga
 In September 2011, a few days before his three-day Sadbhavana fast in Ahmedabad, Modi wrote in a blog, "the analysis of the (justice Sachar Committee) report would clearly show the progress that Muslims of Gujarat have made
 is
 khaas taur par duusare rajyon ke apane bhai-bandon kii tulana main
 "we have no problem as long as Modi does not entertain issues of national pride for Muslim votes," says a Sangh leader
 ”lekin dilachasp baat yah he ki modi ke liye jinhen jeetna ek chunauti he, ve to aresas se baahar ke log hai

 " What will happen now? How long can Asaram stay in jail? Why is the Jodhpur police witnessing former servicemen of Asaram? The Jodhpur police is going to disclose this in a Jodhpur court on 6 November
 sarkari vakil kii maane, to asaram par sajeesh rachane or dushkarm kii dhaaraon se lekar jismfaroshi kii dharaaen bhi lagaai ja sakati hai
 On November 6, the raw-sheet of all the acts of Asaram will be placed in the court in the charge sheet
 asaram ke khilaaf jodhpur kii adaalat main pesh kii jane vaali chargeshit main lagane vaali dhaaraon kii fehrist kaaphi lambii he
 Section 120, Section 342, Section 354, Section 376, Section 375, Section 506, Section 509- All these sections are involved in the case of rape of minor girl of Shahjahanpur
 lekin jodhpur police asaram ko umrakaid dilwane kii bhi puri taiyaari kar rahi he
 This is the reason why the new section is being added to the charge sheet, Section 370
 yah naaballig ladakiyon ko bahala-phusalaakar, bhay, dhokhaa, dabaav, power kaa durupyog kar yaa laalach dekar yaa apharan kar ashram main rakhane se sambandhit he
 At the same time, based on the statements of former servicemen of Asaram, the stream of Jismfaroshi is also being added, wherein the minor girls and women have to be pushed into the swamp of Jismfaroshi, to present before others or to operate the place in which all this happens
 is
 is aarope ko sabit karne ke liye jodhpur police ne asaram ke purv sevadaaron ke hi police ke saamne die bayaan ko aadhaar banaaya he
 These former servants Mahendra Chawla, Rahul and Rakesh will also be called to testify in the court in this case
 in logon ne jodhpur police ko die apane bayaan main kaha he ki asaram or unke bete narayan sai mahilaon or ladakiyon kaa shaareerik shoshan karte the or galat tareeke se apane kabje main rakhte the
 The mouth opener was punished against them, that is why section 370 is being added to the charge sheet
 asaram par naaballig se dushkarm ke maamle main apane sevadaar shiva, warden shilpi, gurukul diarector sharatchand ke saath milakar naaballig ko kutiyaa main bulaane kii sajeesh rachane ke liye dhara 120 lagaai gai he
 Asaram was subsequently charged under section 342, in which he is accused of taking the minor victim hostage in his hut
 saath hi dhara 354 lagi he, jisamen peedita ke saath chhedchhad karne kaa aarope he
 Section 506 has been imposed because Asaram had threatened to kill the victim, including the entire family, upon opening her mouth
 asaram par 509 kii upadhara 34 lagi he, jisamen asaram par mahilaon ke bare main halki or bhaddi baaten bolne kaa aarope he
 The most serious allegations are being made against Asaram under section 376, section 375 and section 6 of the POCSO (POCSO) Act
 dhara 376 main jahaan asaram par dushkarm kaa aarope he, vahiin dhara 375 ke tahat asaram par balaatkaar ke aarope tay kiye gaye hai
 a case has been registered against Asaram under the new Act Poxo in Parliament because the section has been done as a management or employee of an educational or religious institution
 in dhaaraon ke tahat asaram doshi hue, to saat saal se lekar umrakaid tak ho sakati he

 Exposure is reliable and colors are also excellent, in addition to flash performance is also said to be solid
 camere main kuch noage jarur notice kiye hai
 According to this test, the autofocus of the video camera is fast and stabilization is also efficient
 haalanki image ko zyada sharp karata he jo dekhne main kharaab lagata he
 It has been said that it does not do this continuously but sometimes this problem occurs
 dxomark ne testing ke nishkarsh main ye kaha gaya harrfros- auto focus kaaphi tej or sateek he- alag alag lite sorce main color brit hai- sabaject expoger sateek or bharosemand he- detel or noij main acha balance he or flash expoger acha herrchhons- uniform aria me noij dikhataa he- outdoor main pink cast dikhataa he- dark yaa brit aria main kuch shandaar ditels nahin dikhte- bok mod main bler kii samasyaayein aati hai More than 800 people suspected of making, selling and using illegal wiretapping and photography equipment for surveillance in China have been arrested

 In the state of Uttarakhand, the election battle between the two political parties Congress and BJP is limited
 donon siyaasi dalon ke bich mukhya mukaable ke chalate ab star prachaarkon ke rajya main chunavi prachaar teji pakad rahaa he

 bhaajapa ke liye rajnath singh bhi paudi or almoda loksabhaa ke vibhinn kshetron main jansabhaayen kar chuke hai
 State Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat is publicly advising his leaders not to allow mps to ask for work, only to go among the people by showing the Pulwama attack and the might of the army
 puure rajya main sthaneey muddon kii bharmaar hone ke baavjood sattarudh party dwaara bichaai rashtriya muddon kii bisaat ke samandar main ye sthaneey mudde behate dikh rahe hai
 Despite the protest demonstrations, including the announcement of the boycott of the election against the people and their local problems, the focus of political parties is not being focused on these issues
 pradesh sarkaar bhi isi koshish main he ki sarkaar kaa pradarshan chaahe sarkaar kendra kii rahi ho yaa phir pradesh kii chunavi mudda na bane
 Different issues in different seats are important at the local level
 nainital main baliya naala kii suraksha nainital ke astitv ke liye jaruri hone ke baavjood rajya sarkaar kii hilaahvaali par vot kii chot hoti nahin dikhti

 agar pul ban jaataa to nai tehri se ek se dedh ghante tak pratapnagar pahunchaa ja saktaa tha
 Public representatives of 9 villages of Chhajula Patti, located in Dhanaulti Assembly of Tehri Lok Sabha, held a mahapanchayat in Digbogi village and discussed whether to vote or not to vote

 The people's representatives of the villages of Jaunpur have decided to hold a mahapanchayat and not vote if not a road
 sthaneey prashasan ke saath baithak main graminon ne kaha ki 8 april tak prashasan sadak ke nirmaan ko lekar koi thos nirnay nahin letaa he to gramin loksabhaa chunaav kaa bahishkaar karenge
 Despite spending two and a half billion rupees in 13 years, Dobra Chanthi Bridge was not built
 har subah tehri jile ke pratapnagar block ke gramin adhure pade dobra-chanthi pul ko jab saamne dekhte hai to unki ankhon main apane gauravshaalee itihaas kii yaaden tair jaati hai
 According to local villager Arjun Singh, before the lake was built, our fields used to spill gold, but the lake took all
 hamase sarkaar ne vaada kiya ki pul banegaa to kshetra main khushhaali aegi, lekin 13 saal baad bhi pul nahin bana
 Today there is a road in the village but could not make the bridge
 gramin bharat singh ravat kehete hai ki pul na banane ke kaaran pratapnagar kaa vikaas bhi ruk gaya he
 Due to absence of bridge, sick people do not get timely treatment
 is pul kaa kaam varsh 2006 main shuru hua tha
 In 2010, the work was stopped due to inadequate design
 tab tak pul nirmaan par ek arab 50 karod rupee kharch kar die gaye the
 Then in 2015 the construction of the bridge was started again at a cost of one and a half billion

 More than 1 dozen villages in Bageshwar district of Almora Lok Sabha are being warned of boycotting elections due to their many problems
 iske baavjood kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ke pratinidhi in matadaataaon ko manaane nahin pahunch rahe hai
 In contrast, the leaders are engaged in counting their works
 nirvachan ayog or sweep kii team lagaataar gaanv-gaanv jaakar matadaataaon ko shat pratishat matdaan ke liye prerit karne kaa kaary kar rahi he
 While the public is troubled by the apathy of public representatives, development works are not being done
 raajnneetik dalon kaa is tarah se gaanvon se munh modana loktantr ke liye khatra he
 Villagers believe that the people's representatives come to the village only to seek votes
 baavjood iske kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ko sthaneey muddon yaa sthaneey samasyaon kii parvaah nahin he
 The biggest problem of the mountain in Tehri Lok Sabha constituency is unemployment
 barojgari ke kaaran hi pahaado se lagaataar palaayan bad rahaa he 
 Village after village are becoming empty
 magar chunaav lard rahe pratyaashiyon kaa is ore jaraa bhi dhyaan nahin he
 They are engaged in diverting the attention of voters by talking about issues at the national level

 Few guests have sustained injuries during the evacuation process: Jet Airways statement The dispute over the Taj Mahal, the country's largest tourist destination, was not yet over, that the Shia Central Waqf Board has raised the issue of Humayun's Tomb in Delhi
 vakf board ne is sambandh main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko patr bhi likhaa he or maang kii he ki kai acre main faile humayun ke makbare kii jameen ko dilli ke musalamaanon ke kabristaan ke liye di jaae, kyonki unke paas dafnane ko jameen nahin bachi he
 The 'mughals broke 3,000 temples' Asia Waqf Board did not stop here with their demand but also gave the reason behind taking Humayun's tomb
 shiya central vakf board ke chairman wasim rizvi ne PM ko likhi apni chitthee main mughalon ko luteraa bataaya or kaha he ki mughalon ne bharat main3,000 mandiron ko dhwast kiya
 In a letter to the Prime Minister, the Waqf Board has said, "humayun's tomb spread over 35 acres may serve as a cemetery, because Humayun was neither an Islamic preacher nor a religious leader, but he looted India
" aise main shiya vakf board chahta he ki dilli main musalamaanon ko kabristaan ke liye ho rahi killat ko dekhte hue humayun ke makbare kii jagah musalamaanon ke liye kabristaan banaaya jaae
 As historians say, about 3,000 temples of a particular religion were demolished by the Mughals, taking advantage of their strength
 "'mughal the lutere'chitthee main aage likhaa he, "mughal duusare deshon se bharat ko luutane aae the, jinhone bharat main aakar bhartiya raajaaon se unke rajyon ko chhina or unako lut kar yahaan ke badshaah banakar bharat ke nivaasiyon kii khun-paseene kii kamai se lagaan vasuul kar yahaan hukumat karne lage
 And ruled for many generations in India
 mughalon ne puraani bhartiya samskritiyon ko bahut nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 "'the Mughals were not preachers of Islam,' the Waqf Board says that the Mughal emperor was not a preacher of Islam nor a good emperor for India, so many of his grand mausoleums built in India cannot be inherited
 shiya vakf board ke maang se bhuuchaal aa saktaa he kyonki humayun kaa makbara sangrakshit he or puraatatv vibhaag ke sangrakshan main he
 In Uttar Pradesh till now, Hinduist organizations have been accused of questioning buildings associated with Islamic identity, Vinay Katiyar and Sangeet Som have questioned the Taj Mahal, Sangeet Som has even described the Taj Mahal as a black spot but now the Muslim organizations themselves He has started questioning the importance and necessity of Humayun's Tomb

 As soon as this thing came to light, there was a ruckus on it

 in pannon ke prakaashan ke liye sarkaar yaa vibhaag ko koi kharch nahin karnaa padegaa, kyonki galati prakaashak kii taraf se hui he
 'honekeri also accepted this,' It is true that two lines of the national anthem are missing
 vastav main, hamane prakaashak ko jo sidi di thi, usamen koi galati nahin thi
 At the time of publication, two lines were not printed due to computer software malfunction or some other reason
 'modi sarkaar kii nai pahal, ghar baithe puri karen skool se lekar hair ajukeshnaunhone kaha ki NCERT paathya pustak prakaashan ke dauraan saamanyatya kaaphi ehtiyaat baratata he

 According to information received from ITBP sources, Chinese soldiers have infiltrated different sectors of Ladakh several times in the month of July as well as Chinese troops have infiltrated into Barahoti area of uttarakhand

 About 18 km of infiltration was done in the area of depsang within the Indian border
 jaankaron kii maane to ye ilakabharatake liye samrik rup se bahut hi mahatvapurn he
 That is why China repeatedly infiltrates this area
 sutron ne jaankaree di he ki uttari ladakh ke depasang plane main 28 july or 31 july ko china sena PLA ne 17 se 18 kilometre andar tak ghuspaith kii
 This was strongly opposed by the Indian security forces
 bataa den ki chini sainikon ne sirf ladakh ke depasang main hi ghuspaith nahin kii balki ladakh ke hi trig hit or tract jankshan main bhi chini sainikon ne tabadatod 21 july, 28 july or 29 july ko ghuspaith kii
 This infiltration ranged from 1 km to 5 km inside
 isamen bhartiyasurakshablone jab virodh kiya to chini sainik trig hit ke is ilaake se waapas chale gaye
 Not only this, China infiltrated a vehicle near the Pangong lake near Thakung Post at 2 am on July 22 at 8 am
 bataa den ki pengong himalay main ek jhil he
 The height of which is about 4500 meters
 yah 134 kimi lambii he or bharat ke ladakh se tibet pahunchati he
 About 60 percent of this lake is in China
 saath hi is jhil kaa 45 kilometre kaa hissaa bharat main he, jabaki 90 kilometre hissaa chini kshetra main padataa he
 This is the same area of pangong where Chinese soldiers had stoned Indian security forces in the month of August (agust 2017) last year
 is ilaake main bhi chini sena ne pichley maheene main ghuspaith kii he
 Barahoti and Rimkhim in Uttarakhand are places where Chinese soldiers keep intruding in different ways
 pichley 30 july ko chini sainikon ne uttarakhand ke barahoti main kareeb saadhe teen kilometre andar rimakhim ilaake menghuspaithkar andar tak aa gaye the
 The ITBP monitors this area

 dilli kii ek court ne dushkarm kearopee ko barikarte hue kaha ki adaalatein bhaawanaaon main bahakar yaa media kii khabar par nahin chal saktin
 Actually, the case is about a divorced woman and a married man from Delhi
 mahila ne 2012 main purush par shaadi kaa vaada kar do saal takadushkarmakarne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Both were living in live-in
 lekin mahila baad main mukar gai or kaha ki usne galatfahami main shikaayat darj kara di thi
 The woman remarried after her divorce from the first husband, but she also failed

 The woman said in the court that both of them could not marry due to non-completion of the divorce process
 vyakti bekasoor he
 Such a person can not be convicted, Additional Sessions Judge Nivedita Anil Sharma said, 'today there is anger among the people that the courts do not convict the accused of rape
 agar gavaah hi prosicution kaa saath na de yaa paryaapt saboot na hon to kisi ko bhi doshi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 The courts also have to work within the purview of the law
 ' Darul Uloom Deoband has stated in his new edict that extramarital relations of any of the spouses is forbidden in the eyes of Islam but does not affect the validity of their marriage
 darul ulum kii website par prashn 2444 main poocha gaya he ‘pati yaa patni main kisi ek ke vivahetar sambandh hone se kya donon kii shaadi kii vaidhata samaapt ho jaati he?’ is sawaal ke jawaab main fatwa diya gaya, ‘agar pati yaa patni main se koi ek vivahetar sambandh sthapit karata he, to isse unke nikaah kii vaidhata par koi nakaaratmak prabhaav nahin padataa
 Their marriage will continue in its place
 ’fatve main iske saath hi yah bhi kaha gaya, ‘haalanki islam ke mutabik aise sambandh (vivahetar) haraam or gaiyrkanoonee hai or avaidh sambandh banane se vyakti ko paap kaa bhaagi hona padataa he
 To remove this sin, it is necessary to do it and do itigafar

 a post shared by Prernaa Arora (@iprernaarora) on Dec 19, 2017 at 9:49 pm PST congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ek press conference karte hue kaha ki ek nai line nikali he, 'gaayab ho gaya'
 Now the employment of two crore youth has disappeared, the right price to the farmers has disappeared, the promise of 15 lakhs has disappeared, the insurance cost of the farmers has disappeared, the Doklam has disappeared and now the files of Rafael have disappeared
 kal ek badi rochak baat hui ki media ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ham aap par jaanch karenge, kyonki rafel kii filein gaayab ho gayi hai, lekin jisane 30 hajaar karod rupye ko ghotaalaa kiya he, jiske bare main filon main saaf likhaa he, us par koi jaanch nahin hogi
 The media has been warned of an inquiry into the Rafale deal but there is no point of investigation against anyone involved in the scam, the government is playing with institutions to save Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 basic idia he ki kisi bhi cheez ko tod-marodakar narendra modi kaa bachaav karnaa he
 The watchman has to be saved
 saath hi unhone kaha ki sarkaar kah rahi he ki rafel ke kagajaat chori ho gaye to iskaa matlab he yah ve kagajaat sahi hai
 Action should be taken against the Prime Minister, the truth will come out
 rafel saude main har vyakti ke khilaaf jaanch kiijie, pradhanmantri ke khilaaf bhi
 In the files of the Ministry of Defense, it is written that in the Rafale deal, the Prime Minister's Office held parallel talks
 to pradhanmantri ke khilaaf jaanch kyon nahin ho sakati
 In the Rafale deal, Prime Minister Modi has done bypass surgery, the purchase was delayed to benefit Anil Ambani
 bataa den,buudhvaar ko supreme court main centre sarkaar ne kaha ki rafel deal se jude kagajaat chori ho gaye hai or yachikakarta unka istemaal karke aadhikarik gopneeyata kanoon kaa ulanghan kar rahe hai
 This was stated by the Central Government while referring to the report of a news paper during the hearing on the reconsideration petitions filed in the Rafale Deal case in the Supreme Court
 centre sarkaar kii ore se pesh hue agi venugopal ne kaha, 'ye kagajaat raksha mantralay se purv yaa vartmaan karmchaaree dwaara chori kiye gaye hai
 These are confidential documents and cannot be made public
 ' is par supreme court ke chif justise ranjan gogoi ne unase poocha ki sarkaar ne is maamle main abhi tak kya karrwai kii he
 After this, the Central Government replied that we are investigating how the documents were stolen? agar aap dilli metro main safar karte hai to saavdhaan ho jaaen
 a few vicious women are on your pocket
 jaise hi aap laaparvaah hue aapaki jeb hui khaali
 There is such a lady thief gang in Delhi Metro that cleans your pockets in the blink of an eye
 police ne is gang kii kuch sadasyon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The eyes of this gang are especially on women, who travel in Delhi Metro with expensive jewelry and money
 is gang ko chalaane vaali bhi mahilaayein hi hai
 They first find their prey and then chase it
 jaise hi mauka miltaa he unka bag yaa gahane saaf kar detii hai
 This gang takes advantage of the crowds in the metro
 gang kii mahilaayein itani shaatir hai ki ve apane saath bachche lekar chalati hai taaki koi in par shaq na kar sake
 The movement of this gang has been captured in the Delhi Metro KCCTV footage
 gang kii sargana lakshmi or uski paanch saathi minaa, bareli, raakhi, lakshmi, lalita ko is footage main dekha ja saktaa he
 How does this gang work among the crowd
 ye bhi saaf samaj aa jaataa he
 Police has seen this footage many times
 jisamen ye giroh aisi vaardaat ko anjaam de rahaa he
 a case came to the police
 jiske mutabik 2 sitambar ko uma mangal naam kii mahila nai dilli metro stesan se apane ghar sarita vihaar ja rahi thi
 He noticed that there was a small purse missing in his bag which contained diamond rings, diamond rings etc
 saath hi usame manhagaa mobile phone or kaaphi cash bhi tha
 On the complaint of the woman, the police took help of CCTV footage
 jisaki jaanch ke dauraan paaya gaya ki shikayatakarta jaise hi nai dilli se metro main chadhi unke peeche ye mahila gang lag gaya tha
 The investigating team of the police found out that on September 4, the gang's leader Lakshmi, along with her companions, was going to come to the Chandni Chowk metro station
 iske baad trep lagaakar police ne in 6 mahila choron ko giraftaar kar liya
 And the whole matter opened up
 inke paas se chori kii gai kaaphi jewelery bhi baraamad kii he
 So the next time you travel in the metro, be careful
 wo mohabbat bhi teri thivo nafrat bhi teri thivo apnaapan or wo thukaraane kiada bhi teri thiham apni vafaa kaa insaaf kisase maangtevo shahar bhi tera thaor wo adaalat bhi teri thimuhabbat main mili rusavaai kaa dard bayaan karti ye panktiyaan kisi roj sachmuch uski zindagi kii hakeekat ban jaaengi, ye usne khwaabon main bhi nahin sochaa tha
 
 
 But see the fate of fate, after these lines sent to his lover from whatsapp, he said goodbye to this world forever and committed suicide
 ishk main naakaami kii ye dard bhari kahani he rajasthan police kii ek aisi mahila consteble kii, jise agar jindagi main mohabbat ke badale kuch mila, to sirf bevafaayee thi
 Difference with first husband phir pehle aashiq se rusavaai or phir duusare aashiq se bevafaayee
 Eventually the story ended with death
 jodhpur ke mondor thane main tainaat ladi consteble shobhaa ne oonche khwab dekhe the
 She was educated and wanted to become a career woman too
 lekin isi bich uski shaadi ho gai or shaadi se use ek betaa bhi hua
 But life still could not come back on track
 jald hi pati-patni ke rishton main anban rahane lagi or shobhaa ko alag hona padaa
 After this, he got a job in the police, but the lack of a spouse was always a year
 mukut meena naam ke ek consteble ke taur par use apni jindagi doosraa hamdard mila
 He had a relationship with Mukut for many years
 lekin jab shaadi kii baari ai, to mukut ne khud ko shaadishuda bataate hue is rishte ko aage badhaane se manaa kar diya
 This was nothing short of amazing in Shobha's life
 lekin usne phir bhi khud ko sambhaal liya
 Now the car of life started moving again
 lekin jindagi main pyaar kii kami dur karne ke vaade ke saath is baar mahavir naam ke ek or police consteble ne uskaa haath tham liya
 For almost a year, both of them kept on teaching together
 jeene-marane kii kasame khate rahe
 But when it came time to name this love, Mahavir like other people also backed down
 or to or shobhaa jis mahavir se ghanton baaten karatin, saath rahati, usee se peechha chhudaane ke liye mahavir ne apana mobile phone tak swissd of kar liya
 But as if this story did not come to an end
 to iske baad mahavir ke bhai ne kathith taur par shobhaa ko apane bhai se dur rahane ke liye dhamkaana shuru kar diya
 Just after this, no one could think about the decision Shobha made
 shobhaa ne buudhvaar ko apane kamare main jahrili cheez kha kar jaan dene kii koshish kii
 In time, the neighbors got the news of this action of Shobha and she was also taken to the hospital
 lekin doctor uski jindagi bachaane main naakaam rahe
 Then the same police started investigating the case of Shobha's death, which she used to be a part of
 police ko uske makaan se ek suicide note mila or isi suicide note main wo puri kahani mili, jo shobhaa kii jindagi par gujri thi
 At present, the police are preparing to take action against the policemen responsible for his death, on the basis of this suicide note found after Shobha's suicide, but this story of Ruswai in love is now troubling everyone
 mohabbat ke naam par mili dhokhe se ladi consteble ke khudakushi karne ke maamle main police ne uske pati or do pulisavaalon samet aath logon ke khilaaf maamla darj kar liya he
 But this is not the only story of Rajasthan
 chaunkaanewaali baat ye he ki yahaan thanon main us jaisi namaaloom kitni ladi consteble hai, jinke saath khud unke senior hi jyaadati or shoshan kar rahe hai
 In the era of allegations, Ganges is flowing, in which the accusation of an allegation, former Aam Aadmi Party MLA Rajesh Garg has dropped Arvind Kejriwal by making a charge
 unka kahana he ki disambar 2013 main bijepi netaa arun jetali or nitin gadakari ke naam se vidhayak kharidne ke liye farji kol kejariwal hi karaate the
 According to Rajesh Garg, when the Aam Aadmi Party was holding an opinion to form the government in December 2013, at that time, he and many other mlas were getting calls from private numbers late in the morning and in the morning, in which it was said that Nitin is speaking from the offices of Gadkari and Arun Jaitley and you will be given Rs 10 crore, if you support the BJP
 garg ke mutabik unako arun jetali ke yahaan se phone aayaa jis par unhone police main shikaayat darj kara di thi
 But when the caller was caught in January 2014, a call from Arvind Kejriwal's PA and later leader Sanjay Singh, in which he said that his man is trapped, get him released
 garg ke mutabik sanjay singh ne unase baatcheet main sweekaar kiya ki wo farji kol wo hi kara rahe the
 That is, with the consent of Arvind Kejriwal, calls were sent to Jaitley and Gadkari to him and other mlas
 ye maamla mahatvapurn hai kyonki disambar 2013 main arun jetali kaa naam vidhayakon kii kharid-farokht ke silsile main aap netaaon ne khub uchhaala tha
 That is, if the allegations are true, then Jaitley became meaningless with Kejriwal's actions, this case looks like
 aam aadmi party to pehle hi aajkal media camaron par kuch bhi bolne se batch rahi he, isliye koi kuch bhi matlab nikaalata rahe, party chintit nahin hoti dikhti
 But what happens with this? 
 
 khabar to tab bhi khabar kii tarah hi chalegi or saare pahalu dekhakar hi chalegi
 It is to be noted here that the last time where Rajesh Garg brought recordings was in which Kejriwal was talking about breaking Congress mlas
 is baar unke paas aisa koi subut nahin hai, jisase ye sabit ho ki jo rajesh garg bol rahe hai wo sahi he
 Rajesh Garg has already been expelled from the party for anti-party activities
 aise main unke aaropon ko kitni tavajjo milani chahie? If it was only in January 2014 that Garg came to know that all these fake phones and buying and selling were going on with Kejriwal's consent, then why is Garg accusing Kejriwal in March 2015 without any evidence? What happened today? halanki is baat kii sambhaavna se bhi sire se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki ho saktaa he kejariwal or unki party main apane vidhayakon kii eemaandaaree taulne or ye dekhne ke liye ki koun vidhayak tut saktaa he, is tarah kaa tarika apanaaya ho jo ki political intelligence kaa hissaa bhi ho saktaa he
 But how will this be proved? Garg is making allegations and may deny the charge when the party speaks
 sach tabhi pataa chalegaa jab yaa to party aarope ko maan le yaa phir subut saamne aae
 Otherwise, just as the reporter does the story every day and gets engaged on another story the next day
 ye baat bhi bas ai or gai ho hi jaaegi
 The stream is flowing with allegations

 The party has expressed the hope of the arrival of about 2
5 lakh people in this rally, but there is no such ground in Kanpur city where such a large crowd can gather
 kanpur main jo mukhya maidan hai unamem shastri nagar central park or motizil maidan kii kshamta 40-40 hajaar, armapur or saketnagar maidan kii kshamta ek-ek lakh, nanarav or brajendra swaroop park kii kshamta 30-30 hajaar or phulbaag maidan kii kshamta 50 hajaar logon kii he
 Obviously, the capacity of the Kanpur plains is much less than the estimated number of crowds gathering for Modi's rally

 In such a situation, lines of concern have emerged on the foreheads of the BJP workers regarding the selection of the rally venue

 paanch baar ke vishwa champion vishvanathan anand kaa apana khitaab barkaraar rakhane kaa sapana chakanachur ho gaya, jabaki norway ke maganas carlson vishwa championships main dasvin baaji drow karakar shatranj ke nae badshaah ban gaye
 Carlson, who will be celebrating his 23rd birthday on 30 November, won the title as soon as two games remain
 unhone das baaziyon main se teen main jeet darj kii, jabaki baaki saat baziyaan drow raheen
 Carlson 6 in this way
 5 ank hasil karke dasvin baaji ke baad hi vishwa champion ban gaye
 This is the beginning of a new era in the world of chess
 carlson ko khitaab ke liye keval drow kii darkaar thi, lekin unhone neeras khel dikhaane ke bajaay anand ko puri chunauti di, jisase dasvin baaji kaaphi kadi ban gai thi
 Alam is that the Norwegian player forced Anand to fight for four hours and 45 minutes
 vishwa championships ke itihaas main yah sabase ekatarfa muqabla rahaa, jiske samaapt hone ke baad anand ne nishchit taur par raahat kii saans lee hogi
 Anand had won the title five times in 2000, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2012, but ironically lost his crown in his home city of Chennai
 yahi nahin yah pehla avasar he, jabaki anand vishwa championships mukaable main ek bhi baaji jeetne main naakaam rahe
 Anand had won one game in every match since 1991 and the last 22 years
 carlson ne dasvin baaji ke shuru se hi manamafik chaal chali
 He started as he wanted and proceeded properly to surround his opponent
 anand ne is baar haalanki haar nahin maani or apane shandaar rakshan se aakhir main baaji ko drow karavaaya
 Anand adopted Sicilian defense as expected
 unhen masco bairieshan kaa saamana karnaa padaa, jise carlson pehle bhi aajamaa chuke the
 Both players initially made routine moves and Carlson gave a check in the third move
 aakhir main jab board se do chote mohare baahar chale gaye the, tab safed moharon se khel rahe carlson thode phaayde kii sthiti main the, lekin unhone drow kii koshish nahin kii
 It was the 21st move, after which most chess experts believed that both players would be happy to repeat their moves
 carlson khitaab ke kareeb the or anand kii zyada ummid nahin bachi thi
 However the Norwegian player removed before repeating the trick
 anand ne iske baad do chote moharon kii adla-badali ke baad kuch raahat kii saans lee, lekin tab dabaav unheen par tha
 Carlson made the move towards the end with the King's front pawn in the fifth position in the 28th move
 anand ne kuch chaal baad vaapasi kii or aakhir main baaji ghode or kuch pyaadon ke samaapan kii taraf bad gayi
 To make the situation more complicated for Anand, Carlson retained his strong position by advancing his king
 anand ko apane ghode or raja ko bachaav main lagaana padaa taaki aage koi nuksaan nahin ho
 Both players reached the first time control in about three hours, while 40 games were completed, but by then it was clear that either Carlson would win or the game would be a draw
 donon hi sthitiyon main anand kaa abhiyaan samaapt ho janaa tha or paanch baar ke vishwa champion ke liye yah behad aruchikar kaam karne jaisaa tha
 As the game progressed, Anand seemed to have a few batches, but at one time Carlson seemed as if he were a ferocious animal
 ve sahaj dikh rahe the, lekin apni raah main aane vaale har shikaar ko khaanaa chaahate the
 The game had a dramatic turn in the 46th move, when Karlsson made the move after considering it for too long
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki norway kaa khilaadi apane kuch moharon kaa balidaan karnaa chahta he or do chaalon ke baad unhone aisa kiya bhi
 Due to this Anand lost all his pawns and new queens came on board
 anand ke paas atirikt ghoda tha, lekin carlson ke paas rani or khatarnaak dikh rahe do pyaade the
 Anand then noticed the right move and forced Carlson to a draw
 yah baaji 65 chaal tak chali
 Carlson received 60 per cent of the prize money in addition to the title, which amounts to approximately Rs 14 crore

 Sahara, basing Parasaran's opinion, said that the matter does not fall under the jurisdiction of SEBI as the company falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Company Affairs and the Registrar of Companies
 jab sebi ne apane aadesh kaa turant paalan karne ke liye kaha to sahaara ne 31 may, 2010 ke dinaank vaale patr ke jariye company maamalon ke mantralay ko ek prativedan bheja, jisamen usase spasht karne ko kaha gaya ki unki company company maamalon ke mantralay ke adhikaar kshetra main aati he yaa sebi ke

 The Law Ministry also gave its opinion in favor of the same view, which on 8 February 2011, the then Law Secretary and the then Law Minister M

 Despite this, Sebi did not mind

 hindi sahitya ke mahanayake rajendra yadav jindagi kii 83 bahaaren dekh chuke hai or 83 khijaaen bhi
 He has been writing for 65 years
 hans kaa sampadan karte hue 25 baras guzar gaye
 Just a few days ago, many writers of Hindi, including senior critic Namwar Singh to writer Krishna Sobti, gathered at his house to honor him, so many old memories and dreams started floating on the surface again
 yun to khud apane bare main unhone khub likhaa he or usase zyada unke doston-dushmano ne
 But the urge to take some more untold lives was a cause for conversation
 umr ke is padaav par ve kuch aisa kahen, jo pehle kabhi nahin kaha
 a pack of cigarettes was a condition of conversation
 haalanki doctoron ne unhen cigarette na pine kii sakht hidaayat di he, lekin unki jeevatata ke aage kisi doctorl taakid kii bhala kya haisiyat
 Even after refusing lakhs on the day of public honor, he put cigarettes in front of everyone
 ab dost or gharavaale pine nahin dete to chupake se pite hai or raakh toilet main baha dete hai
 Along with Kamleshwar and Mohan Rakesh, he started the new story movement
 upanyaas or kahaniyaan likhin
 Later Basu Chatterjee also made a film on his famous novel Sara Akash
 ab rajendra ji buudhe or kamjor ho rahe hai, lekin man jaise ab bhi jawan he
 Even if the body does not support, but the imaginations do not last
 ud-udakar jane kin-kin thor-thikaanon par baithti hai
 There is no end to his words
 prem ke sabase komal ehsaas kaa zikr karte hue achaanak kehane lagate hai, ''do jindagiyon kaa karj he mujh par, jinhen maine barbaad kar diya
 '' Who? '' Mannu and Mita
 ''mita koun he, koi nahin jaanata, lekin unki 81 varshiya patni or jaani-maani hindi lekhika mannu bhandari yah sweekaarokti sunakar kahati hai, ''ab ehsaas hua bhi to kya? meri to ek hi jindagi thi, jo dukh or akelepan main biit gai
 i have not had a physical relationship with Rajendra since the birth of daughter Rachna 25 years ago
 meraa jivan to mently, imoshanalee, sexuali bankerpat hi rahaa
 Thankfully now they are realizing this in the last days
 ''25 saal se koi sambandh nahin? yah jaananaa kisi sadame kii tarah tha
 Does Rajendra realize this pain? He says, "yes, i understand that suffering, but what could i do?" Mita was in my life then
 jivan main kabhi ek saath do striyon ke saath mere shaareerik sambandh nahin rahe
 i could not think of such a relationship with Mannu while Mita
 ''kya aap hindi ke kaisanova hai? ve muskaraa dete hai
 "you keep provoking me by saying this
 '' ve thik inhen shabdon main kehete nahin ki lekhkeey rachanaatmakataa kii buniyadi jarurat he 'stri', lekin kuch isi andaaj main hemingve ko kot karte hai
 "hemingway wrote that every new woman in my life gave me a new novel
 '' hemingve hi kyon, agar sirf lekhan par yakeen karen to nobocove or markhej samet kai lekhakon ke buudhe purush charitra khubasurat, jawan ladki kii firaaq main rahete hai
 Should all these be exhaled with a single sweep of morality? Cheap, sexually frustrated, masculine? But then who will answer the question of what it is that those old characters do not hate
 prem or ghrinaa kaa ajeeb khel he yah
 The secrecy and independence with which Rajendra confesses his love, many women give him a certificate of character as easily as this secret freedom, which men give women a million times more easily
 par yah certificate ghatiya or saamanti he
 It is a man or woman who gives it
 lekin is kaabiletarif bebaaki main bhi ek pech or mardwaadi antarvirodh he
 Asked that if Manu had lived the same life as you, you would have formed an extramarital affair, what would have been your reaction? He says, "I can't bear it
" mannu ko maaf nahin kar paata
 This is the real contradiction
 ek ore ve kehete hai, ''meraa puraa jivan hi niyamon or bandhanon se mukti kaa sangharsh he
 Breaking the rules was my rule
 '' vahiin duusari ore mannu niyam toden to unhen takalif he
 After all, the same question as to why they could not break this masculine rule? But the amazing thing is their Democratic attitude
 is jawaab par aap 83 saal ke us bujurg par bhadak sakate hai, unhen bhala-bura or saamanti kah sakate hai par ve muskuraakar kahenge, ''sach baat he, lekin yah bhi to socho ki yah 20 saal puraani baat he
 Today i do not think so
 '' lekin is jawaab par bhi aap unki laanat-malamat kar sakate hai or ve maje se sunenge
 "wellden, i have chosen freedom for myself in my youth, woman's freedom is being realized in old age
" ''lekin aurat kii aazaadee kaa ehsaas mard kyon kare? aurat secchueli deprivd he yaa nahin, yah to vah khud sochegi or faisle legi
 Thousands of opportunities to run poles on Rajendra ji are seen
 striyon ne aazaadee se likhaa to vibhutinarayan raay ne unhen 'chhinaal' kii oopaadhi de di
 Rajendra ji was expected to throw his speeches, but he started saying, "he said wrong, but will he hang him for this?" Why care so much about these comments? Let me say if you say cheenal
 tum bolo ki haa, hum chhinaal, kya kar loge
 "then he was issued a character certificate
 lekin unka paksh saaf he, ''chhinaal ho, ke jawaab main auraten yah safai kyon detii phiren ki 'nahin, ham acchhee hindustani auraten hai
 'no, we are not good
 na thim, na hongi
 You can say whatever you want, but our intellectual development cannot stop the flight of our freedom
 '' magar is vivaad ko lekar rajendra or maitreyi ke bich jo abola shuru hua to hindi ke tamaam mardaana swar maitreyi ke khilaaf aag ugalane lage
 She says that many male writers accused me, "rajendra ji made her a writer, and today she became deceived if she got recognition
 ''maitreyi aahat hai kyonki yah tippanee bhayanak he
 Don't you think that sleeping with 20 women is not as feudal and masculine as it is to favor a woman for making her a writer? The question was in front of Rajendra ji and the answer was, "this is a very malevolent comment
 kahani chhapakar ehsaan nahin kiya
 To say 'I have made' is a very patriarchal comment
 meri or maitreyi kii dosti jab tak thi, bahut athmiya or niyaswaarth thi
 "rajendra himself, who is standing in the box of life, is not ready to give himself a clean chit in every trial
" ve kehete hai, ''main apane saath kitne aparaadh-bodh or kitni jindagiyon kaa boj lekar jaaoongaa
 i think my heart is shaken that the girl who is taking care of me day and night in illness, i did not even look at her in childhood
 kabhi ek ghante baithkar usase baat tak nahin kii
 "but Rachna no longer thinks about it
 vakt ke thapedo ne saare gam bhula die, ghaav mitaa die
 They are happy thinking that "papa wanted life anyway, sir
" ve popular hai, log unhen jaanate hai
 i have no complaints
 ''rajendra ke andar kitne or rajendra basate hai? ghar choda, patni-beti sabakaa saath chhot gaya, lekin sahitya kaa daaman ve aaj bhi kasakar thame hai
 Although they say that i am still enjoying solitude
 yah poochne par ki mannu se alag hone ke baad mita kaa haath kyon nahin tham liya, niyamon ko todane vaale rajendra saamaajik niyamon kii duhai dene lagate hai
 "I couldn't live with him without marriage
" samaaj main dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa
 "mannu goes bifurcation"
 ''samaaj kii unhone parvaah kab kii, jo aaj kar rahe hai
 They could have a relationship by marrying one, but have avoided being together without marriage
 '' ab mannu ko bhi koi shikaayat nahin he
 Rajendra's silence says that Saki from Pila de Ouk, who hates us / Piala does not give up, neither should he give alcohol
 or mannu kaa haal yah he ki na poocha jaae he usase, na bolaa jaae he hamase
 Asking them about Rajendra's disloyalty and bewilderity, they say that my book read a story as well, while their silence says that love is not for me, that is true
 mannu ke har dard kii kahani is bindu par aakar khatm hoti he, ''main rajendra se prem karti thi
 There are many evils in them and there are good ones too
 yahi sammohan he unke vyaktitv kaa
 Rajendra has been successfully editing Hans, the most popular literary magazine in Hindi for the last 25 years
 is patrika ke marfat unhone sabase pehle stri, dalit or musalamaanon se jude muddon ko uthaaya
 Gave platforms to new creators and this platform produced more than a dozen new good writers
 sambhawatah vah hindi ke iklaute aise vyakti hai, jo bahut khulkar kehete hai ki stri ko deh ke bandhan se aaazaad hona chahie
 There is no objection to this sexual freedom, but what next? What is that, more important than sectional freedom
 rajendra kehete hai, ''stri aatmanirbhar ho, sahitya kii satta main sendhamari kare
 Gain strength and position
 '' yah poochne par ki kya 25 saal baad upar se baithkar aap hans kii sabase oonchi kursi par ek stri ko dekhnaa chahenge, ve kehete hai, ''haa, main chahta hum, aisa hi ho
 "one of the most pressing questions in the Hindi circles at this time is who will be the successor of Hans and Akshar Prakashan after him?" Rajendra ji says, "he who will be able to take responsibility
 vaise maine yah jimmedaari chaar logon ko dene kaa faisla kiya he, beti rachana, sanjay sahay, vinaa uniyaal or sangam pandeya
 Together, they will take over the responsibility of Hans
 ''rajendra hindi ke khalanaayak se lekar sabase bade yarabash, harfanmaulaa or jindadil dost hai
 He is more than a father to the boy Kishan and his family living with him
 unki sahakarmi vinaa uniyaal ko ve kabhi bos lage hi nahin
 Friends love them
 ladkiyaan aaj bhi is buudhe kaisanova par jaan chhidakati hai
 Strange puzzle is that he lives by seeing the Kafir die
 rajendra mud-mudakar dekhte hai or kehete hai, ''maine apni jindagi litarechar ke naam kar di
 "he wished that his identity as a writer would have been greater, but he was sad that his identity as the editor of Hans became larger than the authorial identity
" kuch kahaniyaan ab bhi adhuri hai
 Hopefully, one day will be fulfilled
 aisi hajaaron adhuri khwahishon par dam nikalataa he har roj
 Rajendra is on trial for life
 aaropon-pratyaropon kii lambii fehrist he
 The densest moments of happiness and the longest nights of sorrow
 kuch aise aparaadh-bodh, kuch aisa dard ve apane saath lekar jaaenge, jisase nijaat paane kaa nuskhaa sansar kii kisi kitaab main nahin tha
 Alcohol, friend, woman, love, no one could become a medicine for that merge
 ek hi jindagi thi
 Finished the Zikar
 har mode par phisale, har gali main bhatke
 He made mistakes
 lekin jindagi main reverse kaa koi batan nahin hota
 Let bygones be bygones
 lekin dil se kahaan jaati hai baaten
 She keeps sitting as a remembrance
 umr kii is dahalij par rajendra ke dil main yaadon kaa jo ghamaasan machaa he, unke sirahaane baitha koi dost shaayad hi haath badhaakar use chhu paata he
 He says, "we have to bear some pain alone
" jindagi kaa ekant baantne koi nahin aata

 Appearing before the Commission on behalf of the Law Minister, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi said that Khurshid did not refer to any particular minority community and kept only the government policy announced earlier

 The Election Commission had issued a notice to Khurshid on his statement, in which he said that if his party came to power in Uttar Pradesh, then in the 27% reservation quota of obcs, minorities would be given 9% reservation
 singhvi ne kaha, ‘sambandhit vyakti kendriya mantri kii haisiyat se nahin bol rahe the

 Owaisi said in the meeting on Sunday, 'I will be in India but will not speak Bharat Mata ki Jai
 kyonki yah hamaare samvidhan main kahin nahin likhaa he ki bharat mata kii jai bolnaa jaruri he
 If you want, put a knife on my neck, but Bharat Mata ki Jai will not speak

 "give wisdom to Allah Owaisi", Sudhir Mungtivar, Minister in the Government of Maharashtra, said that we will pray that Alla Tala give wisdom to Owaisi

 AAP leader Yogendra Yadav said after the meeting of top leaders of the party at the residence of party chief Arvind Kejriwal that even if Lt Governor Najeeb Jung invited the party to form the government, he did not cite this proposal citing lack of majority
 Will reject yadav ne kaha, 'ham sarkaar gathit nahin karne ja rahe hai

 unke anusaar, pani pine se kahin zyada acha hoga ki ham pani se bharpoor zyada se zyada chizon ko khaaen
 According to them, when we drink water, it goes directly through our digestive system, which does not provide much nutrition for vitamins and salts, but when we eat something rich in water, our cells get plenty of vitamins and salts

 However, his eyes were mostly on meeting Uddhav Thackeray
 isaki vajah yah he ki pichley kuch samay se shivasena bijepi se naaraaz chal rahi he
 Shiv Sena is an ally of the BJP in the central and Maharashtra governments
 aise main isaki naaraazgi aagaamee chunaav par bijepi ke liye mushkil paidaa kar sakati he
 Therefore, the BJP wants to sway the Shiv Sena in every storm before the Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi sutron ke mutabiyamit shah or uddhav thakare ke bich mulakatskaratmak rahi, jabaki shivasena ne is par chuppi saadh lee he
 On Wednesday, when Amit Shah reached Matoshree to meet Uddhav Thackeray, the Thackeray family welcomed him fiercely, bypassing political differences
 unako dhokala, khandavi or amras samet anya pakwaan kaa swaad chakhaaya
 Earlier, after reaching Matoshree, Amit Shah remembered Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray
 iske baad donon netaaon ke bich band kamare main kareeb ek ghante 40 minute tak meeting hui, jisamen bigade rishte ko sudhaarney kii koshish kii gai
 During this, Uddhav Thackeray raised the issue of personal attacks by BJP leaders before Amit Shah
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki amit shah or uddhav thakare kii mulaakaat sakaaratmak rahi
 When Amit Shah arrived in Matoshri along with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Uddhav Thackeray, his wife Rashmi and sons Aditya and Tejas were also present
 is dauraan bijepi pradesh adhyaksh rawasaheb daanve maujuud nahin rahe
 It is being told that Danve was kept away from the meeting of Amit Shah and Uddhav Thackeray

 At the same time, even before Amit Shah and Uddhav met on Wednesday, Shiv Sena attacked the BJP through its mouthpiece 'saamana'

 Mamta's rail will not play the game of promises anywhere

 Lalu Yadav put a wave of gifts in every budget speech
 janata ke bich number badhaane ke chakkar main apane rajya ke liye nai pariyojnaon kaa dhadadhad elaan kiya
 But seeing the condition of most of those projects, it would be said that Didi should avoid such promises
 railway kii mali haalat ko chhod den to lalu yadav kii rail vaadon kii railempel hi sabit hui
 Projects announced with great enthusiasm either could not get ahead of the files or are still hanging in the balance due to very slow pace
 lalu kii badi ghoshnaaon main se bihar ke chhapra main ban rahi wheel factory ko agar chhod diya jaae to unki baaki ghoshnaaon par koi amal nahin hua he
 The list of such projects is very long in his state Bihar
 -saaran main 2 hazaar karod se zyada kii laagat se banane vaali deazal locomotive factory-madhepura main 1300 karod kii laagat se balane vaali elactric locomotive factory-sonpur main banane vaale deazal engine or guds wagon repere workshop-sastipur main wagon repere workshop-madhepura, sitimadi or chaksikandar main lagane vaali kancreet sleeper factorilalu ke ye ve projects hai jo vaadon ke signal se aage nahin bad paae
 Lalu had given railway projects worth Rs 55,000 crores to his state as railway minister, but now there is speculation that many of those projects on which work has not started yet, Mamata Banerjee can give to other states
 lalu ke kai bade projectus jahaan jameen se uthe hi nahin vahiin unki kai choti-choti yojanaayen bhi dharashai ho gayi
 For example - plans to replace the paper and plastic cups with earthen dust - plans to sell buttermilk in stations and trains - plans to adopt Khadi in trains - plans for cleaner toilets - plans to build world class stations Either the railways remained confined only in the speech of the budget or it became frustrated
 aise main mamata ke saamne apni bajet ghoshnaaon ko amali jama pehanaane kii chunauti badi hogi

 Team India is in trouble
 master blaster sachin tendulkar ko bukhaar he
 At the same time, Zaheer Khan's muscle is pulled during the first innings
 sachin tendulkar ne england ke khilaaf pehle cricket test main bharat kii pehali pari ke dauraan bukhaar ke baavjood ballebaaji kii or out hote hi team hotel laut gayi
 Only one step away from 100 international centuries, Tendulkar had a high fever when he hit the ground at 77 for two
 unhone lunch tak england ke ballebaajon ko safalataa se maharoom rakhaa or duusare satr main chah chauke lagaaye
 He scored 34 runs, facing 58 balls during his nearly one and a half hour innings
 stuart broad kii gend par duusari slip main kaich thamane ke baad tendulkar team hotel laut gayi or pataa chalaa he ki unhone antibiotic lekar aaraam karne ko tarjeeh di
 Sachin Tendulkar may get it soon India If India have to stop England from taking a 1-0 lead in the four-test series, then Tendulkar's fit will be important for the team
 tendulkar bukhaar ke kaaran england kii duusari pari ke paanch over ke dauraan shanivaar ko kshetrarakshan ke liye bhi maidan par nahin utre
 If Tendulkar has to come out to bat at his regular position number four, he will have to field during England's second innings on Sunday for the fourth day
 agar yah diggaj khilaadi aisa karne main naakaam rahata he to bharat kii duusari pari ke dauraan vah paanch wicket girane ke baad hi ballebaaji karne ke liye utar paaenge
 In response to England's innings declared for 474 for eight in the first innings, India had scored 286 runs in the first innings with an unbeaten 103-run stand by Rahul Dravid
 vahiin pehali pari ke dauraan jahir khan kii mansapeshi khinch gai, jiske baad se vah maidan par nahin nazar aae
 Zaheer also played with the runner for batting
 uske baad vah england kii duusari pari main maidan par ab tak nahin utre hai
 There is also doubt about his playing in the second Test of the series, which will be in Nottingham from Friday
 mobile par taaja khabaren, photo, video dekhne ke liye jaaen m

 The Green Park Stadium, once a stronghold of cricket in the country, has been very fortunate for the Indian team
 is maidan par bharat ne ab tak kul 11 match khele hai, inamen se aath main uski jeet hui he
 Now that India has to play the third match of the ongoing series here with the West Indies, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team would like to win the series with a hat-trick on this ground
 teen maichon kii siries main donon timen 1-1 kii barabari par hai
 India had a 1-0 lead in Kochi, but the West Indies equaled the victory in Visakhapatnam
 bharat ne kanpur main antim match 2008 main khelaa tha
 He defeated England by 16 runs in that match
 usase pehle bhartiya team ne navambar 2007 main pakistan ko is maidan par 46 ranon se patkhni di thi
 At this ground, India has lost to Pakistan once and twice to the West Indies
 westeindies ke liye yah maidan bharat se adhik bhaagyashaalee rahaa he
 This team has played two matches on this ground and has won both
 1994 main westeindies ne yahaan bharat ko 46 ranon se haraaya tha or usase pehle 1987 vishwa cap main usne srilanka ko 25 ranon se shikast di thi
 Whatever the figures tell the story, but it will be difficult for India to overcome the Caribbean team
 darren saimi ne jis tarah apni team ko jeet dilaai or jis tarah se chaar ballebaajon ne ardhashatak lagaae, usase jaahir he ki carabian ballebaaj lay main laut chuke hai
 It will be very important for India to win the toss in this match, because in the event of losing the toss, the Caribbean team will like to bowl once again, as the dew falls in Kanpur and this can cause a lot of trouble for the Indian bowlers
 vishakhapattanam main match ke antim kshanon main os girani shuru ho gai thi or is kaaran bhartiya gendbaajon ne khub galtiyaan kii
 With a wet ball, Bhuvneshwar bowled full-length balls, which he usually did not bowl
 aise main captain dhoni kii najar sabase pehle toss par hogi
 In terms of performance, India will have to improve their bowling, as this is a weak link from the last match
 kochi main haalanki gendbaajon ne hi bharat kaa kaam aasaan kiya tha lekin kanpur ke halaat kochi se bilkul bhinn honge or gendbaajon ko nae sire se shuruuaat kerani hogi
 Teams: India: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohit Sharma
 westeindies:dwen braavo (captain), keeran powell, darren braavo, johnson charles, jesan holder, sunil naren, veerasaimi parmal, ravi rampal, darren saimi, marlan samuels, el simons

 sibiai dwaara helicopter saude kii jaanch ke bich senaaon ko yah chintaa sataane lagi he ki kahin 1970 or 1980 ke dashak ke hathiyaaron ke aadhunikeekaran main samasya na aae
 These people believe that India will never have to depend on Russia again
 rakshaamantri eke antni ne kaha ki har kharid par prashn nahin uthaae jane chahie
 We should focus on modernization soon due to our neighbors
 vahiin, sutron kaa kahana he ki choper saude main sibiai jaanch ke baad adhikari is maamle main kuch dhime ho gaye hai
 In the last five years, the Indian Navy has modernized rapidly by spending
 sutron ke anusaar is maamle main sabase zyada nuksaan nausena kaa hoga
 The Navy is negotiating prices in the case of 16 multi-role helicopter purchases
 sutron kaa kahana he ki agar augustawestland ko pratibandhit kiya jaataa he to is company ke saath eurocopter ke upkram se liye ja rahe helicopteron kii pichley 13 saal se jari prakriya ko ek baar phir aarambh karnaa padegaa
 These new helicopters were being purchased to replace the old secking helicopters

 Amidst the investigation into the helicopter deal by the CBI, the forces have started worrying that the weapons modernization of the 1970s and 1980s should not be a problem
 in logon kaa maananaa he ki kahin phir se bharat ko rus par hi nirbhar na hona pade
 Defense Minister AK Antony said that every purchase should not be questioned
 hamen padosiyon kii badaulat jald aadhunikeekaran par dhyaan dena chahie
 At the same time, sources say that authorities have slowed down a bit in this case after the CBI probe into the chopper deal
