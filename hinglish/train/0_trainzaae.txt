 uttar pradesh main is saal ke chunaav parinaamon ke fouran baad anti-romeo squad khabaron main chhaae rahe
 These are actually police squads deployed in public places to prevent "molestation" of women
 haalanki is baat kaa vishleshan kuch vakt baad hi kiya ja sakegaa ki ye daste kitne kargar rahe, par is vakt is baat par gaur karnaa jaruri he ki mahilaon ke khilaaf hinsa or mahilaon kaa yon utpeeda jaruri nahin ki baahar sadakon par hi hota he
 Sometimes it is also within the walls of the houses
 duusare, agar aap aparaadh par zyada vyapak najariye se nigaah daalen, to dahej hatyaein, gharelu hinsa, yon hamale or tejaab se hamale zyada badi or badhati hui chintaa kaa vishay hai
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau data (2015), in Uttar Pradesh, where a total of 16 women across the country
 8 fisadi aabaadi rahati he, 35,527 maamle yani mahilaon ke khilaaf desh bhar main hue kul aparaadhon ke takreeban 10
 9 percent of crimes were recorded
 anti-romia daston kaa gathan hi ek tarah se mahilaon kii aazaadee par hamalaa he, kyonki isaki vajah se unhen apane saath gum rahe purush mitra ke saath apane rishte kaa khulaasa karnaa hoga
 That too when our constitution does not allow anyone to interfere in the personal freedom and dignity of any person
 isliye in daston ke kaam karne kaa tarika asanvaidhanik he or vyakti kii nijee aazaadee kaa ulanghan karata he
 In my opinion, the whole notion of anti-romeo squads came out of this ideology that women have to behave in a special way
 aisa lagata he ki pitrusattatmakataa apni sabase badtareen shakl main uttar pradesh main dikhaai detii he
 Here, women's access to public spaces as well as their options is extremely limited
 aisa maahaul na keval auraton ke dilodimag main balki unke mata-pita main or zyada bade str par samaaj main dar paidaa karata he
 Not only this, calling these police squads as anti-romeo squad tells the insensitivity of the Gaddinshin party in Uttar Pradesh
 yah asamvedansheeltaa shakespeare ke sahitya ke us saanskrithik or aitihaasik nayak ke prati bhi he, jo prem kaa pratik tha or varg tathaa dushmani ke muddon kii vajah se apni preyasi se shaadi nahin kar sakaa tha
 The formation of these squads seems like an extension of the same forces that pull the hair of women on Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve, let alone those who oppose Love Jihad
 meri raay main is kadam se bhrashtachar main bhi ijapha hoga, kyonki or zyada sharmindagi se yaa parivaar kii shirkat se bachane ke liye log police afasaron ko ghoose dene kii koshish karenge
 It must be noted that change cannot be brought about by creating fear
 main yah suzav dena chaahuungi ki swasth samaaj or zyada sahishnutaa kii samskruti kaa nirmaan karne ke liye hamen samaaj or siyaasi tabake kii bhoomika ko badhaane kii jarurat he
 Leaders should be prevented from making irresponsible statements and should be pulled for this
 auraton ke khilaaf aparaadhon se nipatate vakt police ko tej or mustaid hona chahie
 There should be more women police officers in the department
 saath hi deshbhar main ekamusth samaadhaanon ke saath sankat ke vakt dakhal dene vaale or zyada centre kaayam karne chahie or langikta se jude muddon par mardon kii counselling jarur kii jaani chahie
 We should also make sure to get the punishment done swiftly and smartly and various crimes against women should be sent to fast track courts
 iske alaava, mahilaon ko unke saath hone vaale aparaadhon kii report likhavane ke liye protsaahit kiya janaa chahie, kyonki dar ko hameshaa ke liye banaae rakhane kii samskruti ko roka ja sakegaa
 We have to understand that the formation of anti-romeo squads represents a very narrow attitude towards the greater evil of crimes against women
 iske liye ek bahustareey or bahuaiami ranneeti kii jarurat he, jisamen samasya se asardaar dhang se nipatane ke liye hitdharakon kii bahut badi taadaad ko shaamil karnaa hoga
 Therefore, it can be advised that lawmakers and those who implement them should understand this

 In her speech during the rally, Mamta quipped on the Prime Minister's address 'mann ki Baat' on the radio and said that no one knows whose mind he is talking about
 doordarshan ban gaya he bijepi darshanbangla main apane sambodhan main mamata ne kaha, 'har samay ve lacture dete rahete hai
 Don't know whose point is the matter of the mind

 If there is no mind, how will it work? ' bhoomi adhyadesh par apane virodh kaa zikr karte hue mamata ne kaha, 'ham bhoomi adhyadesh ke khilaaf hai

 "the thieves who are asking about the account", in relation to the cbi's notice to TMC about the party's account, Mamta Banerjee said, "those who are thieves are asking about the account
 agar aapako meri party ke khate kii jaankaree chahie to aap iskar vibhaag ke paas jaaen
 Instead, you are sending me a notice
 notice jamaa hongi or ham ise aapako waapas lautaa denge
 You came to power and are sending me notice
 kal aap satta main nahin rahenge or log aapako notice bhejenge
 "the Chief Minister of West Bengal said," i will speak against the forced land acquisition a hundred times
 agar aap samajhate hai ki notice bhejne se aap meraa munh band kar denge, tab aap galat hai
 Accusing the Modi government of trying to shut down the voices of those criticizing her, Mamta said, "congress imposed the Emergency
 ab yah apatkaal se bhi adhik he
 The doors have been closed for journalists
 unhone sab kuch band kar diya he
 Mamta said, "if someone raises a voice (against the Modi government) then his voice is suppressed
 unhen yaa to sibiai yaa idi yaa enie yaa biguef se daraaya jaataa he

 railway (RRB, Railway) ne buudhvaar ko kaha divyangjanon kii niyukti se sambandhit sabhi aavashyaktaaon ko niyamon ke tahat puraa kiya gaya he or abhi unhen samyojit karne ke tareeke khojane kii koshish kii ja rahi he, lekin mandi house main pradarshan kar rahe divyang pradarshnakariyon kii nazaij maangon ko puraa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The protesters, who applied for the Railway Group d (RRB Group D) jobs, once again sat on a dharna at Mandi House on Wednesday demanding a job under Divyang quota, affecting traffic in central Delhi
 railway (railway, RRB) ne kaha ki usne samooh dwaara naukariyon ke liye vichaar ke liye prastut 10 railway jone main 184 ''divyangjan'' ummidavaaron kii suchi kii jaanch kii he, jisamen paaya gaya ki kisi ne bhi jaruri 28 pratishat ank hasil nahin kiye hai
 Manoj Pandey, Member, Personnel in the Railway Board, said that representatives of the railways met with the protesters several times to know their grievances
 samooh kii maangon main se ek maang yah he ki alag-alag tarah ke divyangon ke liye khaali pade padon kaa vilay kar diya jaae
 He said that the ministry is considering some "disabled" candidates who have said that they have inadvertently applied for only one disability (mainly disability related to mobility), even if it is under multiple categories
 Are Divyang isliye vah bahu divyangta (emdi) cote ke tahat vichaar ke liye paatr hai
 The second part of the budget session of Parliament starts today
 is satr main bhi vipaksh kaa joardaar hangaamaa sarkaar kii naak main dam kar saktaa he
 The Nirav modi-pnb scam, the cbi's grip on Karti Chidambaram, will surround the Congress government on many issues, including the BJP government in Meghalaya
 lekin is bich is satr main sarkaar kii koshish rahegi ki vah atake hue bilon ko paas karwaae
 There are three bills in which the whole country is eyeing it
 1
 Fugitive Economic Offender Bill This bill has recently received approval from the Union Cabinet
 pichley kuch dinon main jis prakaar se banking sector se jude ghotaale saamne aae hai, us lihaaj se ye bill kaaphi myne rakhata he
 Those who leave the country under this bill will be declared as fugitive scamsters
 yah bill unheen maamalon main maanya hoga, jahaan aparaadh 100 karod rupee se adhik ke hon
 Scheduled offenders will be identified under the bill
 court kisi ko bhi bhagoda ghoshit kar saktaa he
 However, the scam limit for this should be more than Rs 100 crore
 isse bade aparaadhiyon par ankush lagaaya ja sakegaa
 Not only the property earned by the fugitive, but all the property can be seized
 philhal neerav modi or vijay maalya jaise bhagode kanoon kii kamiyon kaa phayda uthaate the or ek baar videsh bhaag jane ke baad unke khilaaf kaarywahi karne main kaaphi samay lagata he
 The new law will speed up this process
 2
 Will the triple talaq bill be passed in Rajya Sabha? The much talked about triple talaq bill was approved by Lok Sabha, but it was stuck in Rajya Sabha
 sheetakaaleen satr ke dauraan teen talaak bill kaaphi bada mudda rahaa tha, lekin congress samet vipaksh kii kuch aapattiyon ke kaaran bill rajyasabha main atak gaya tha
 The BJP accused the Congress of adopting a double stance because the Congress supported the bill in the Lok Sabha and opposed it in the Rajya Sabha
 darasal, zyaadaatar partiyon kaa kahana yah he ki vah teen talaak kii haalat main pati ko 3 saal ke liye jail bheje jane ke khilaaf hai
 The government says that if the fear of being sent to jail is over, then this law will have no meaning
 3
 In addition to the two big bills for constitutional registration to the OBC Commission, it is very important to pass a bill to give constitutional status to the OBC Commission
 yah bill bhi sheetakaaleen satr se hi atka hua he
 This bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha, it is yet to be passed in Rajya Sabha
 vipaksh kaa aarope tha ki sarkaar iske jariye rajyon ke adhikaron ko chhina ja rahaa he, lekin sarkaar ne in aaropon ko khaarij kiya he
 Speaker Sumitra Mahajan ji, being a news anchor, was understanding your pain and your challenge today
 mulk kii nigahen aapaki taraf thim ki kahin aapse taraazoo kaa palada unki taraf to nahin jhuk rahaa he jo kabhi aapke apane the yaa unki taraf to nahin jhuk rahaa he jo aapako shaq kii nigaah se dekh rahe honge
 In the heated debate, when the charges were going on like this, you handled your work well
 ham andaaza kar sakate hai ki aapke liye bhi aaj kaa din yaadgaar rahaa hoga
 i congratulate you inglish main big thakyuu mam
 Prime Minister Modi was not in the House but he would also be upset if he is not in the Lok Sabha
 unke jaise sakriy rajaneta ne aaj kii bahes se khud ko kaise dur rakhaa hoga yah soch kar tanaav or romaanch donon hota he
 Sadly, it should be those who have not seen the Lok Sabha debate
 is masale kaa tanaav or thakaan sushamaa swaraj ke chehre par dikh rahaa tha
 The helplessness of not understanding himself, the uneasiness of explaining to others took him today in the midst of war-like front
 ek aise vakt main jab aapako hamalaa karte vakt uske khilaaf bhi nirmam hona padataa he jiske saath ek kism kaa raajnneetik shishtachar ban jaataa he
 In Wednesday's debate, all these relationships started to fade
 ek duusare ke pariwaron par hamale hone lage
 The Congress also had to agree to the debate due to the public pressure created against it due to non-running of Parliament
 jis istife kii shart par bahes nahin ho rahi thi wo bahes bhi hui or istipha bhi nahin hua
 The government frustrated the opposition by putting Parliament at stake
 aam taur par vipaksh sarkaar ko hataash kar diya karata he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu, who joined hands with the Congress for a debate in the morning, began to surround the Congress as soon as the debate was over
 latifa sunaakar lajaaya to naam le lekar ginaya
 Became MP for the second time from Gulbarga in Karnataka, 73-year-old Mapanna Mallikarjun Kharge, who won ten consecutive assembly elections, was also at stake
 saadhaaran se dalit parivaar main janme khadge par zimmedaari thi vidisha kii saansad sushamaa swaraj jaisi anbhavi or tej tarraar netaa ko gherne kii
 Through his spontaneous Hindi, Kharge asked seven to eight questions
 - pehla sawaal poocha ki britain ke saath khato-kitabat ko jari kyon nahin kar rahi sarkaar
 - Second question, why did Lalit Modi not be advised to contact the Indian High Commission
 - teesraa sawaal lalit modi ko pehle bharat aane par jor kyon nahin diya
 - Fourth question why the government did not appeal to the Supreme Court if the passport case was lost in the High Court
 apil na karne kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 - Fifth question how Lalit Modi was given a long-term visa or residency permit
 - chatha sawaal nayaa passport jari karne ke maamle main kya kadam uthaae
 - And the seventh is that Lalit Modi says that if he is not going to India for security reasons, then the Indian government cannot protect him
 khadge ne kaha ki sushamaa swaraj ne khud galati maani he isliye ham unka istipha maangate hai
 Why said that if Lalit Modi gets the documents then india-uk relations will not be affected
 thodaa hangaamaa tab hua jab khadge is maamle main vasundhara raaje ko bhi ghaseetne lage ki lalit modi ko basane ke liye bharat sarkaar se chipa kar zaruri dastauez kyon diye
 The name of the Chief Minister is not taken in the Parliament, the Chief Minister of the state cannot be discussed, so he was denied
 magar kisi na kisi sandarbh main vasundhara kaa sandarbh aata hi rahaa
 Would have been a member of the House, the answer would have been whether any such secret document was signed or not
 jawaab dene kii baari sushamaa swaraj kii thi
 His speech was no less blunt
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki meri koi galati nahin he
 It is a crime to help a woman who is a citizen of India, who has been suffering from cancer for 17 years, who is not involved in any crime, i confess this crime
 mere saamne vichaaradhin yahi tha ki "agar british sarkaar usko yatra dastauez de detii he, dene kaa faisla kar leti he to kya ham donon deshon ke rishte kharaab honge? us par maine maukhik sandesh bhijwaya ki british sarkaar apane niyamon ke anusaar lalit modi kii arzi par vichaar kar sakati he
 If the British government decides to give a travel document, our relations will not deteriorate
 isliye ye mudda hi nahin he
 Questions were arising as to whether the foreign minister gave information about this oral order to anyone in the ministry, it could not be answered
 sawaal uthaa ki lalit modi kii madad kii gai to jawaab main kaha gaya ki unki patni ek bhartiya naagarik hai unki madad hui or ye gunaah he to kabool he
 After this Sushma Swaraj's speech takes another turn
 pehle apane pati or beti ke bare main safai detii hai ki ve kahin se bhi lalit modi se jude maamle main shaamil nahin hai
 This is not a conflict of interest
 hiton kaa takaraav to wo he jab pi chidambaram vitt mantri hote hai or unki patni nalini chidambaram ko unke apane vibhaag inakam tex kii taraf se vakil niyukt kiya jaataa he
 When the matter arose in the Rajya Sabha, Chidambaram sahib replied that he was not aware
 chidambaram ne khud se hi khud ko bari kar liya
 After this, Sushma Swaraj targeted Rahul Gandhi that Rahul speaks that he helped a criminal
 main aapse puuchhati hum - bataaie sushamaa swaraj ne lalit modi kaa kya sin karke de diya
 Rahul Gandhi says that the work that Sushma has done has been done in secret
 agar chup chup ke kiya to kwatroki ko bhagane kaa kaam tumne kiya
 If he did any work in secret, then in Rajiv Gandhi's government, he did the work of driving away Anderson
 or main apni ore se nahin kah rahi, ye inke apane mukhyamantri kii kitaab he
 Autobiography of Arjun Singh ji
 arjuna singh keval mukhyamantri nahin the madhya pradesh ke, usee pad par the jis par aaj rahul gandhi hai
 Was the National Vice President of Congress
 us samay maa-betaa adhyaksh upaadhyaksh nahin hote the
 There used to be some other person
 aisa iz ikval tu kiya ki congress sann rah gai
 This is the specialty of our politics
 ek kii galati ko duusare kii galati se pardaa mil jaataa he
 Sushma's attack also forced Rahul Gandhi to speak
 tippaniyan Rahul Gandhi said that Sushma ji held my hand yesterday and said why are you angry with me, son
 maine tumhaara kya kiya he
 i told Sushma ji that i did not get angry with you
 aapkaa aadar karata hum
 Sushma ji, i am speaking the truth, so you closed your eyes
 aapane ankhen neeche kyon kar leen
 The Prime Minister does not have the courage to come to the House to see, hear and say the truth
 maanavtaa kaa kaam sab karte hai magar sushamaa ji duniya main akeli hai jo ye kaam chup kar karti hai
 If Sushma ji would not have attacked the Gandhi family, Rahul Gandhi might not have been holding his hand and telling the son
 baad main arun jetali ne shant sadan main vistaar se lalit modi ke maamle kaa kanoonee pahalu bataaya or istife kii maang ko khaarij kiya
 Emotions were rising in such a way that there should be no issue at all
 ek duusare ke khandaanon kaa hisaab hua or apni khoobiyon kaa bakhaan
 Somebody's heart may get scared due to such fierce politics but surely our politicians must have enjoyed it a lot
 pradhanmantri modi sadan main nahin the lekin loksabhaa main na hona unhen bhi khala hoga
 Thinking how an active politician like him would have kept himself away from today's debate is both tense and thrilling
 afsos unhen bhi hona chahie jinhone loksabhaa kii bahes nahin dekhi
 The tension and fatigue of this issue was visible on Sushma Swaraj's face
 khud ko na samajhe jane kii bebasii, dusron ko samajha dene kii bechaini unhen aaj yuddh jaise morche ke bich le gai
 At a time when you have to be ruthless against him while attacking, with which a kind of political etiquette is formed
 buudhvaar kii bahes main ye tamaam rishte dharashaayi hone lage
 There was an attack on each other's families
 sansad na chalane se apane kilaaf banate jan dabaav ke kaaran congress ko bhi bahes ke liye raji hona padaa
 The resignation condition which was not being debated was also debated and the resignation was not done
 sansad daanv par lagaakar sarkaar ne vipaksh ko hi hataash kar diya
 Generally, the opposition frustrates the government
 subah bahes ke liye congress se haath jod kar apil karne vaale sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu bahes puri hote hi congress ko gherne lage
 i was ashamed to hear the Latifah and counted it with a name
 karnataka ke gulburg se duusari baar saansad bane, das baar lagaataar vidhansabha chunaav jite 73 saal ke mapanna mallikarjun khadge kaa bhi kaaphi kuch daanv par laga tha
 Born in a simple Dalit family, Kharge had the responsibility to surround a veteran and fast-paced leader like Vidisha MP Sushma Swaraj
 apni chhitakati sanbhalti hindi ke zariye khadge ne saat aath sawaal puche
 - The first question asked why the government is not issuing letters with Britain
 - doosraa sawaal ki bhartiya ucchayog se sampark kii salaah kyon nahin di lalit modi ko
 - Third question, why did Lalit Modi not insist on coming to India first
 - chauthaa sawaal ki hai court main passport kaa cese haarane par sarkaar ne supreme court main apil kyon nahin kii
 Whose decision was it not to appeal
 - paanchavaa sawaal ki lalit modi ko lambey samay kaa visa yaa residency permit kaise diya gaya
 - Sixth question what steps should be taken in the matter of issuing a new passport
 - or saatvaan ki lalit modi kehete hai ki ve suraksha kaarnon se bharat nahin ja rahe hai to kya bharat sarkaar unki suraksha nahin kar sakati he
 Kharge said that Sushma Swaraj herself has admitted the mistake, so we ask for her resignation
 kyon kaha ki agar lalit modi ko dastauez milte hai to bharat britain ke sambandhon par asar nahin padegaa
 a little uproar ensued when Kharge also dragged Vasundhara Raje into the matter as to why he had given the necessary documents by hiding from the Government of India to settle Lalit Modi
 sansad main mukhyamantri kaa naam nahin liya jaataa he, rajya ke mukhyamantri ke bare main charchaa nahin ho sakati he isliye unhen manaa kiya gaya
 But in some context, reference to Vasundhara continued
 sadan kii sadsy hoti to jawaab miltaa ki aise kisi gupt dastauez par dastakhat kiya he yaa nahin
 It was Sushma Swaraj's turn to answer
 unka bhaashan bhi kam dhuandhar nahin tha
 Sushma Swaraj said that it is not my fault
 aisi mahila kii madad karnaa jo bharat kii naagarik he, jo 17 varshon se cancer se grast he, jo kisi aparaadh main lipt nahin he, uski madad karnaa gunaah he, main ye gunaah kabool karti hum
 The question before me was that "if the British government decides to give him the travel documents, will the relationship between the two countries deteriorate? i sent a verbal message that the British government applied Lalit Modi according to his rules Can consider agar british sarkaar yatra dastauez dene kaa faisla karti he to hamaare sambandh kharaab nahin honge
 So, this is not the issue
 sawaal uth rahe the ki kya videsh mantri ne is maukhik aadesh kii jaankaree mantralay main kisi ko di, iskaa jawaab nahin mila
 The question arose that if Lalit Modi was helped, then in response it was said that his wife is an Indian citizen, he was helped and this is a crime
 iske baad sushamaa swaraj kaa bhaashan doosraa mode letaa he
 First, she clarifies about her husband and daughter that she is not involved in the case related to Lalit Modi from anywhere
 ye hiton kaa takaraav nahin he
 The conflict of interest is when p Chidambaram is the Finance Minister and his wife Nalini Chidambaram is appointed as a lawyer on behalf of her own department, Income Tax
 jab rajya sabha main maamla uthaa to chidambaram sahab ne jawaab diya ki unki jaankaree main nahin hua
 Chidambaram acquitted himself by himself
 iske baad sushamaa swaraj ne rahul gandhi ko nishane par liya ki rahul bolte hai ki ek apradhi kii madad kii
 i ask you - tell me what Sushma Swaraj signed and gave to Lalit Modi
 rahul gandhi kehete hai ki sushamaa ji ne jo kaam kiya he wo chup chup ke kiya he
 If you did it secretly, then you did the work to drive away Quattrocchi
 agar chup chup ke koi kaam kiya to rajeev gandhi kii sarkaar main anderson ko bhagane kaa kaam chup chup ke kiya
 And i am not saying from my side, this is his own Chief Minister's book
 arjuna singh ji kii autobiography
 Arjun Singh was not only the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, he was in the same position that Rahul Gandhi is today
 congress ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh the
 The mother-son president was not the vice president at that time
 koi or vyakti hota tha
 It was equal to that the Congress was stunned
 hamaari raajnneeti kii yahi khubi he
 The mistake of one gets the curtain from the fault of the other
 sushamaa ke is hamale ne rahul gandhi ko bhi bolne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 The comments rahul gandhi ne kaha ki kal sushamaa ji ne meraa haath pakadaa or kaha ki betaa tum mere se gussa kyon ho
 What have i done to you maine sushamaa ji se kaha ki maine aapse gussa nahin kiya he
 look up to you
 sushamaa ji main satya bol rahaa hum to aapane ankhen neeche kar leen
 Why did you turn your eyes down? pradhanmantri main saahas nahin he ki ve sadan main aakar sach dekhen, sune or kahen
 Everyone does the work of humanity but Sushma ji is the only one in the world who does this work in secret
 sushamaa ji ne gandhi parivaar par hamalaa na bolaa hota to shaayad rahul gandhi haath pakad kar betaa kehane vaali baat na bataate
 Arun Jaitley later elaborated in the Shanti Sadan the legal aspect of Lalit Modi's case and dismissed the demand for resignation
 galakat bhaashanon ke bich bhavanaaen aise chadh utar rahi thi ki koi mudda hi na ho
 The accounts of each other's clans were accounted for and a description of their strengths

 saadhaaran se dalit parivaar main janme khadge par zimmedaari thi vidisha kii saansad sushamaa swaraj jaisi anbhavi or tej tarraar netaa ko gherne kii
 Through his spontaneous Hindi, Kharge asked seven to eight questions
 - pehla sawaal poocha ki britain ke saath khato-kitabat ko jari kyon nahin kar rahi sarkaar
 - Second question, why did Lalit Modi not be advised to contact the Indian High Commission
 - teesraa sawaal lalit modi ko pehle bharat aane par jor kyon nahin diya
 - Fourth question why the government did not appeal to the Supreme Court if the passport case was lost in the High Court
 apil na karne kaa faisla kiskaa tha
 - Fifth question how Lalit Modi was given a long-term visa or residency permit
 - chatha sawaal nayaa passport jari karne ke maamle main kya kadam uthaae
 - And the seventh is that Lalit Modi says that if he is not going to India for security reasons, then the Indian government cannot protect him
 khadge ne kaha ki sushamaa swaraj ne khud galati maani he isliye ham unka istipha maangate hai
 Why said that if Lalit Modi gets the documents then india-uk relations will not be affected
 thodaa hangaamaa tab hua jab khadge is maamle main vasundhara raaje ko bhi ghaseetne lage ki lalit modi ko basane ke liye bharat sarkaar se chipa kar zaruri dastauez kyon diye
 The name of the Chief Minister is not taken in the Parliament, the Chief Minister of the state cannot be discussed, so he was denied
 magar kisi na kisi sandarbh main vasundhara kaa sandarbh aata hi rahaa
 Would have been a member of the House, the answer would have been whether any such secret document was signed or not
 jawaab dene kii baari sushamaa swaraj kii thi
 His speech was no less blunt
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki meri koi galati nahin he
 It is a crime to help a woman who is a citizen of India, who has been suffering from cancer for 17 years, who is not involved in any crime, i confess this crime
 mere saamne vichaaradhin yahi tha ki "agar british sarkaar usko yatra dastauez de detii he, dene kaa faisla kar leti he to kya ham donon deshon ke rishte kharaab honge? us par maine maukhik sandesh bhijwaya ki british sarkaar apane niyamon ke anusaar lalit modi kii arzi par vichaar kar sakati he
 If the British government decides to give a travel document, our relations will not deteriorate
 isliye ye mudda hi nahin he
 Questions were arising as to whether the foreign minister gave information about this oral order to anyone in the ministry, it could not be answered
 sawaal uthaa ki lalit modi kii madad kii gai to jawaab main kaha gaya ki unki patni ek bhartiya naagarik hai unki madad hui or ye gunaah he to kabool he
 After this Sushma Swaraj's speech takes another turn
 pehle apane pati or beti ke bare main safai detii hai ki ve kahin se bhi lalit modi se jude maamle main shaamil nahin hai
 This is not a conflict of interest
 hiton kaa takaraav to wo he jab pi chidambaram vitt mantri hote hai or unki patni nalini chidambaram ko unke apane vibhaag inakam tex kii taraf se vakil niyukt kiya jaataa he
 When the matter arose in the Rajya Sabha, Chidambaram sahib replied that he was not aware
 chidambaram ne khud se hi khud ko bari kar liya
 After this, Sushma Swaraj targeted Rahul Gandhi that Rahul speaks that he helped a criminal
 main aapse puuchhati hum - bataaie sushamaa swaraj ne lalit modi kaa kya sin karke de diya
 Rahul Gandhi says that the work that Sushma has done has been done in secret
 agar chup chup ke kiya to kwatroki ko bhagane kaa kaam tumne kiya
 If he did any work in secret, then in Rajiv Gandhi's government, he did the work of driving away Anderson
 or main apni ore se nahin kah rahi, ye inke apane mukhyamantri kii kitaab he
 Autobiography of Arjun Singh ji
 arjuna singh keval mukhyamantri nahin the madhya pradesh ke, usee pad par the jis par aaj rahul gandhi hai
 Was the National Vice President of Congress
 us samay maa-betaa adhyaksh upaadhyaksh nahin hote the
 There used to be some other person
 aisa iz ikval tu kiya ki congress sann rah gai
 This is the specialty of our politics
 ek kii galati ko duusare kii galati se pardaa mil jaataa he
 Sushma's attack also forced Rahul Gandhi to speak
 tippaniyan Rahul Gandhi said that Sushma ji held my hand yesterday and said why are you angry with me, son
 maine tumhaara kya kiya he
 i told Sushma ji that i did not get angry with you
 aapkaa aadar karata hum
 Sushma ji, i am speaking the truth, so you closed your eyes
 aapane ankhen neeche kyon kar leen
 The Prime Minister does not have the courage to come to the House to see, hear and say the truth
 maanavtaa kaa kaam sab karte hai magar sushamaa ji duniya main akeli hai jo ye kaam chup kar karti hai
 If Sushma ji would not have attacked the Gandhi family, Rahul Gandhi might not have been holding his hand and telling the son
 baad main arun jetali ne shant sadan main vistaar se lalit modi ke maamle kaa kanoonee pahalu bataaya or istife kii maang ko khaarij kiya
 Emotions were rising in such a way that there should be no issue at all
 ek duusare ke khandaanon kaa hisaab hua or apni khoobiyon kaa bakhaan
 Somebody's heart may get scared due to such fierce politics but surely our politicians must have enjoyed it a lot
 karnataka ke gulburg se duusari baar saansad bane, das baar lagaataar vidhansabha chunaav jite 73 saal ke mapanna mallikarjun khadge kaa bhi kaaphi kuch daanv par laga tha
 Born in a simple Dalit family, Kharge had the responsibility to surround a veteran and fast-paced leader like Vidisha MP Sushma Swaraj
 apni chhitakati sanbhalti hindi ke zariye khadge ne saat aath sawaal puche
 - The first question asked why the government is not issuing letters with Britain
 - doosraa sawaal ki bhartiya ucchayog se sampark kii salaah kyon nahin di lalit modi ko
 - Third question, why did Lalit Modi not insist on coming to India first
 - chauthaa sawaal ki hai court main passport kaa cese haarane par sarkaar ne supreme court main apil kyon nahin kii
 Whose decision was it not to appeal
 - paanchavaa sawaal ki lalit modi ko lambey samay kaa visa yaa residency permit kaise diya gaya
 - Sixth question what steps should be taken in the matter of issuing a new passport
 - or saatvaan ki lalit modi kehete hai ki ve suraksha kaarnon se bharat nahin ja rahe hai to kya bharat sarkaar unki suraksha nahin kar sakati he
 Kharge said that Sushma Swaraj herself has admitted the mistake, so we ask for her resignation
 kyon kaha ki agar lalit modi ko dastauez milte hai to bharat britain ke sambandhon par asar nahin padegaa
 a little uproar ensued when Kharge also dragged Vasundhara Raje into the matter as to why he had given the necessary documents by hiding from the Government of India to settle Lalit Modi
 sansad main mukhyamantri kaa naam nahin liya jaataa he, rajya ke mukhyamantri ke bare main charchaa nahin ho sakati he isliye unhen manaa kiya gaya
 But in some context, reference to Vasundhara continued
 sadan kii sadsy hoti to jawaab miltaa ki aise kisi gupt dastauez par dastakhat kiya he yaa nahin
 It was Sushma Swaraj's turn to answer
 unka bhaashan bhi kam dhuandhar nahin tha
 Sushma Swaraj said that it is not my fault
 aisi mahila kii madad karnaa jo bharat kii naagarik he, jo 17 varshon se cancer se grast he, jo kisi aparaadh main lipt nahin he, uski madad karnaa gunaah he, main ye gunaah kabool karti hum
 The question before me was that "if the British government decides to give him the travel documents, will the relationship between the two countries deteriorate? i sent a verbal message that the British government applied Lalit Modi according to his rules Can consider agar british sarkaar yatra dastauez dene kaa faisla karti he to hamaare sambandh kharaab nahin honge
 So, this is not the issue
 sawaal uth rahe the ki kya videsh mantri ne is maukhik aadesh kii jaankaree mantralay main kisi ko di, iskaa jawaab nahin mila
 The question arose that if Lalit Modi was helped, then in response it was said that his wife is an Indian citizen, he was helped and this is a crime
 iske baad sushamaa swaraj kaa bhaashan doosraa mode letaa he
 First, she clarifies about her husband and daughter that she is not involved in the case related to Lalit Modi from anywhere
 ye hiton kaa takaraav nahin he
 The conflict of interest is when p Chidambaram is the Finance Minister and his wife Nalini Chidambaram is appointed as a lawyer on behalf of her own department, Income Tax
 jab rajya sabha main maamla uthaa to chidambaram sahab ne jawaab diya ki unki jaankaree main nahin hua
 Chidambaram acquitted himself by himself
 iske baad sushamaa swaraj ne rahul gandhi ko nishane par liya ki rahul bolte hai ki ek apradhi kii madad kii
 i ask you - tell me what Sushma Swaraj signed and gave to Lalit Modi
 rahul gandhi kehete hai ki sushamaa ji ne jo kaam kiya he wo chup chup ke kiya he
 If you did it secretly, then you did the work to drive away Quattrocchi
 agar chup chup ke koi kaam kiya to rajeev gandhi kii sarkaar main anderson ko bhagane kaa kaam chup chup ke kiya
 And i am not saying from my side, this is his own Chief Minister's book
 arjuna singh ji kii autobiography
 Arjun Singh was not only the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, he was in the same position that Rahul Gandhi is today
 congress ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh the
 The mother-son president was not the vice president at that time
 koi or vyakti hota tha
 It was equal to that the Congress was stunned
 hamaari raajnneeti kii yahi khubi he
 The mistake of one gets the curtain from the fault of the other
 sushamaa ke is hamale ne rahul gandhi ko bhi bolne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 The comments rahul gandhi ne kaha ki kal sushamaa ji ne meraa haath pakadaa or kaha ki betaa tum mere se gussa kyon ho
 What have i done to you maine sushamaa ji se kaha ki maine aapse gussa nahin kiya he
 look up to you
 sushamaa ji main satya bol rahaa hum to aapane ankhen neeche kar leen
 Why did you turn your eyes down? pradhanmantri main saahas nahin he ki ve sadan main aakar sach dekhen, sune or kahen
 Everyone does the work of humanity but Sushma ji is the only one in the world who does this work in secret
 sushamaa ji ne gandhi parivaar par hamalaa na bolaa hota to shaayad rahul gandhi haath pakad kar betaa kehane vaali baat na bataate
 Arun Jaitley later elaborated in the Shanti Sadan the legal aspect of Lalit Modi's case and dismissed the demand for resignation
 galakat bhaashanon ke bich bhavanaaen aise chadh utar rahi thi ki koi mudda hi na ho
 The accounts of each other's clans were accounted for and a description of their strengths

 Former India spinner Maninder Singh believes that off-spinner r Ashwin's international career has gone awry due to not being handled properly by the team management and has become a defensive bowler
 kuch samay se kharaab farm se jujh rahe aswin asia cap main nae ection ke saath gendbaaji karte najar aae
 Maninder said, he is trying many variations
 jab aap bahut kuch aajamaane kii koshish karte hai to apni moulikta kho dete hai or yahi ho rahaa he, jisase main chintit hum
 He said, i think Ashwin is the match winner
 vah test, van-de yaa tii-20 jita saktaa he lekin use sahi tareeke se handle nahin kiya gaya
 i do not understand what the bowling coach, head coach and captain are doing to him
 yadi main hota to uski gendbaaji ko is tarah bigadane nahin detaa ki use ection badalanaa pade
 The fastest bowler to take 100 Test wickets in the last 80 years, Ashwin flopped on the Indian team's tour of South Africa and New Zealand
 maninder ne kaha, kisi ko use bataanaa chahie ki use bhartiya team main isliye rakhaa gaya, kyonki usne ipel jaise 20 overon ke cricket main wicket lene kii tatparta dikhaai thi
 Maninder said, after that you came into the Test team and after last year's Australian series i read somewhere that he said 'my job is to stop rung'
 use yah kisne kaha
 By the captain
 unhone kaha, mujhe lagata he ki use sahi tareeke se handle nahin kiya gaya
 Someone was picked in the Indian team because he had the urge to take wickets and was also taking wickets in 20 overs cricket, but in Test cricket where he needed to take wickets, he became a defensive bowler
 kuch to gadabad hua he
 Someone is giving him the wrong opinion
 purv spinner ne kaha ki aswin ko apane kariyar ko dharre par laane ke liye achche coach kii jarurat he
 "the BCCI will have to wake up and arrange a good coach for the bowlers," he said
 aswin hi nahin jadeja ko bhi madad kii jarurat he

 6 lakh rupee Late Monday in Hardoi district of Uttar Pradesh, a woman committed suicide by setting fire to a closed room with her four children over a domestic dispute
 police ne bataaya ki jile ke hariyaavaan thana ke purela gaanv nivasee ramsatan paal kii patni sunita paal ne der raat apane chaar bacchon ke saath band kamare main mitti kaa tel daalkar aag laga lee, jiske kaaran sunita paal (35), jyoti (10), sivam (8), sonam (4) or nisha (3maah) kii ghatnasthal par hi jalakar maut ho gai
 Police said that prima facie the incident happened due to a family dispute
 police ne sabhi shavon ko apane kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhej diya he or is puure maamle kii chaanbin kar rahi he
 The MCD has been on strike for eight days
 aath dinon se ham yahi sun rahe hai ki dilli sarkaar ne paisa nahin diya, to emsidi ko bijepi ne kangaal bana diya
 Both sides are giving their own facts, but no complete picture is being made, so that one knows who is to blame
 bijepi is tarah se pesh aa rahi he jaise is maamle main wo jo kah rahi he vahi sahi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party is also claiming that what it said is the ultimate truth
 dilli nagar nigam ke dedh lakh se zyada karmchaaree hadtaal par hai
 Due to this, work has been stopped in the government school and hospital run under the corporation
 sadakon par kooda failata ja rahaa he
 Somewhere the doctors, the cleaning staff and the administrative staff staged demonstrations at different places
 koi kisi ke ghar jaakar kooda phenk aa rahaa he to koi dilli sarkaar se yah bhi maang kar rahaa he ki dilli nagar nigam ko phir se ek kar diya jaae
 Chairman of the Joint Employees Front, Rajesh Mishra has said that the strike will go on till the three municipal corporations are united
 aath dinon se chal rahi is hadtaal ke kaaran aam logon ko takalif to ho hi rahi hogi, yah sawaal bhi mahatvapurn he ki karmchaariyon or pension par nirbhar rahane waalon ko paise nahin milenge to wo apana kharch kaise chalaayenge
 You can find out the sorrow and happiness of everyone but cannot find out who is responsible for this situation
 is bahes main shaamil logon kii bhashaa se aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki pehle raajnneetik virodh nikalataa he, baad main us virodh ko sahi tehraane vaala tathy jo unke hi hisaab se nikalataa prathit hota he
 It seems that there is a competition for deception
 donon paksh apane apane tathyon se is tarah bharamaa de rahe hai ki tathy tak pahunchnaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Till now, in the battle of Center vs Delhi, it used to be felt that Delhi has no right
 kisi anya maamle main chal rahi sunwaayee ke dauraan shahari vikaas mantralay ne apane halafname main kaha he ki teenon nigam dilli sarkaar ke tahat aate hai
 Now does this mean that Lieutenant Governor is responsible for the MCD as the chief
 lekin alji ko chunauti dene vaali dilli sarkaar ke paas yahi mauka nahin he ki wo alji se bina puche faisla le or apane adhikaar kaa istemaal kare
 The Delhi government said that the Center has the right to dissolve the corporation from the appointment of MCD commissioner 
 bengalooru main mukhyamantri kejariwal ne kaha ki dilli municipal act kii dhara 486 ke tahat dilli sarkaar emsidi kii jaanch kar sakati he, lekin jab sarkaar ne acount dikhaane ko kaha to emsidi ne manaa kar diya
 Kejriwal asked why the crores of crores of rupees received from parking, hoarding and housing tax are not being accounted for
 wo paisa kahaan ja rahaa he
 His government has given 100 million more to MCD this year
 ye 100 karod rupee kahaan gaye
 His own government has recovered 300 crores in the North MCD and 76 crores in the East MCD
 ye paisa kahaan gaya
 Kejriwal said that the money had been given till 31 December, yet why the employees went on strike from 27 January
 emsidi ko 31 janvari tak 690 karod kii zarurat he jisamen se ham 550 karod kaa lone de rahe hai
 When it comes to giving money, it is said that Delhi government gives it and at the time of committing uproar, Delhi becomes a Union Territory
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki doctoron ne likhaa he ki emsidi ke aspataalon ko dilli sarkaar le le
 They do not want to live with MCD
 19 unionon ne likhaa he ki dilli nagar nigam ko bhang kar diya jaae
 Kejriwal demanded that the MCD should have a CBI probe
 iske jawaab main purvi or uttari emsidi ke meyaron ne kaha ki The CBI is ready for investigation, but along with them, the Kejriwal government, ministers and legislators should also have a CBI inquiry
 ise kehete hai bharamaane kii polytics
 Confuse it so much that it is not known what the issue was
 meyar ne kejariwal ke us daawey ko chunauti di ki aapane uttari emsidi ko 890 karod die hai
 But the salary for a year comes to Rs 3,000 crore
 sahi baat he, lekin kya meyar rabindra gupta saal bhar kaa sara paisa ek hi saath maang rahe hai
 An MCD pays full year's salary to employees only in January
 kya is bakaaye se emsidi kaa sankat ek baar main hi samaapt ho jayega yaa yah sankat phir khadaa hone vaala he
 Ravindra Gupta said that sacrificing his ambition to the people of Delhi is not a scam
 is nae scam ke liye unki daad di jaani chahie
 Do not know how many leaders will be lost in this scam
 ummid he rabindra gupta ne ye vaala scam nahin kiya hoga
 Well, it seemed to the mayor that they believe that the MCD is in financial trouble
 unhone artical 243 kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki kisi rajya ke nagar nigam main koi vittiya sankat he to use littget karne kii zimmedaari us rajya sarkaar kii hogi
 Kejriwal is running away from his responsibility
 agar vittiya sankat he to iskaa jimmedaar bhi koi hoga
 Is it Kejriwal or Mayor Ravindra Gupta
 jab hamane artical 243 padhaa to usamen ek jagah saaf-saaf likhaa he ki rajya kii vidhayika nigam ke khaaton kii jaanch kar sakati he
 Can calculate
 ye baat shaayad meyar nahin bataa sake
 Kejriwal said that the North MCD receives 17 crore from advertisements, while 25 times more should come
 north emsidi ke meyar ne kaha ki kejariwal ji vigyaapan vibhaag se 25 guna paisa aap kamakar dikhaa dijie hamen koi aapatti nahin he
 If Kejriwal really asked for this department
 mujhe nahin pataa ki rabindra gupta is chanauti ko lekar vaaki gambhir hai yaa bhavukta main kah gaye
 The comments meyar rabindra gupta ne kaha ki dilli sarkaar kahati he ki pehle didie uskaa paisa de
 This type of thing can be done by a mental patient
 east emsidi ke meyar ne kaha ki chauthe vitt ayog kii report jaldi lagu ho
 The Delhi government accepted the report on December 2 and said that whenever the Center considers it applicable to the suggestions of the report, the Delhi government will accept it
 bengalooru main mukhyamantri kejariwal ne emsidi par bhrashtachar ke kai aarope lagaae, jiske jawaab main meyar ne kaha ki aadhe se zyaada adhikari dilli ke madhyam se dilli nagar nigam ke andar recruit kiye jate hai kejariwal sahab
 Through your government
 agar koi bhrashtachar kar rahaa he to wo ham kar rahe hai yaa dilli sarkaar? dilli sarkaar ke adhikari kar rahe hai bhrashtachar
 It is revealed for the first time that corruption in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi is because the Delhi government has appointed its officers and employees
 mere khyaal se is formula kaa patent kara lenaa chahie
 Aam Aadmi Party is also doing politics
 kejariwal ne kaha ki ek saal baad dilli nagar nigam ke chunaav ho rahe hai or unki party jeetne vaali he
 Announcing to win a year ago
 agar abhi wo 550 karod karj ke taur par or 142 karod stamp duty ke taur par de sakate hai to pehle hi kyon nahin de diya
 More than 1
5 lakh employees of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi are on strike
 iske kaaran nigam ke tahat chalane vaale sarkari skool or aspataal main kaam thap padaa he
 Garbage is being spread on the streets
 kahin doctor to kahin safai karmchaaree to kahin prashasnic karmchaaree alag-alag jagahon par dharna pradarshan karte rahe
 If someone is coming to someone's house and throwing garbage, then someone is also demanding from the Delhi government that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi be reunited
 sanyukt karmchaaree front ke adhyaksh rajesh mishra ne kaha he ki jab tak teenon nagar nigam ek nahin honge tab tak hadtaal chalegi
 Due to this strike which has been going on for eight days, the common people must have been suffering, it is also important that the people who depend on employees and pension will not get the money, then how will they meet their expenses
 aap sabakaa dukh or sukh pataa laga sakate hai magar yah nahin pataa laga sakate ki is sthiti ke liye koun zimmedaar he
 From the language of the people involved in this debate, you can guess that political opposition comes out first, then later the fact that justifies that protest seems to be coming out according to their own
 aisa lagata he ki bharamaane kii hode machi he
 Both sides are misleading with their own facts in such a way that it is difficult to reach the facts
 abhi tak centre banaam dilli kii is ladaai main yahi ahsaas karaayaa jaataa tha ki dilli ke paas koi adhikaar nahin he
 During the ongoing hearing in another case, the Urban Development Ministry has said in its affidavit that the three corporations fall under the Delhi government
 ab kya iskaa yah matlab nikaala jaae ki leftinent garvanar mukhiya ke naate emsidi ke liye zimmedaar hai
 But the Delhi government, which challenged LG, does not have the chance to take a decision and exercise its authority without asking LG
 dilli sarkaar ne kaha ki emsidi kamishnar kii niyukti se lekar nigam ko bhang karne kaa adhikaar centre ke paas he
 In Bengaluru, Chief Minister Kejriwal said that under Section 486 of the Delhi Municipal Act, the Delhi government can investigate the MCD, but when the government asked to show the account, the MCD refused
 kejariwal ne poocha ki emsidi ko parking, hording or houseing tex ke jo karodon rupee milte hai, uskaa hisaab kyon nahin diya ja rahaa he
 Where is that money going unki sarkaar ne is saal emsidi ko 100 karod zyada die hai
 Where did these 100 crores go? unki apni sarkaar ne north emsidi main 300 karod or east emsidi main 76 karod kii recovery kii he
 Where did this money go kejariwal ne kaha ki 31 disambar tak kaa paisa de diya gaya tha, phir bhi 27 janvari se karmchaaree hadtaal par kyon gaye
 MCD needs 690 crores till 31 January out of which we are giving a loan of 550 crores
 jab paise dene kii baat aati he to kehete hai dilli sarkaar de or hangaamaa karne ke vakt dilli centreshasit rajya ban jaataa he
 Arvind Kejriwal said that the doctors have written that the Delhi government should take the hospitals of MCD
 ve emsidi ke saath nahin rahanaa chaahate hai
 19 unions have written that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi be dissolved
 kejariwal ne maang kii ki emsidi kii sibiai jaanch honi chahie
 In response, the mayors of the Eastern and Northern MCD stated that sibiai kii jaanch ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin unke saath saath kejariwal sarkaar, mantri or vidhayakon kii bhi sibiai jaanch honi chahie
 This is called politics of deception
 itnaa bharamaa do ki pataa hi na chale ki masalaa kya tha
 The Mayor challenged Kejriwal's claim that you had given Rs 890 crore to the Northern MCD
 lekin saal bhar ke vetan kaa hisaab to 3,000 karod aata he
 Right, but is Mayor Ravindra Gupta asking all the money for the year together
 ek emsidi puure saal kaa vetan janvari main hi karmchaariyon ko de detii he
 Will the crisis of MCD end with this dues or is this crisis going to stand again
 rabindra gupta ne kaha ki dilli kii janata ko apni mahatvakanksha kii bali chadha dena scam nahin he
 She should be shunned for this new scam
 is scam main na jane kitne netaa nap jaaenge
 Hopefully Ravindra Gupta will not scam this one
 khayr meyar kii baat se laga ki ve maanate hai ki emsidi main vittiya sankat he
 He cited Article 243 that if there is a financial crisis in the municipal corporation of a state, it will be the responsibility of the state government to litigate it
 apni zimmedaari se bhaag rahe hai kejariwal
 If there is a financial crisis, then someone will also be responsible for it
 wo kejariwal hai yaa meyar rabindra gupta
 When we read article 243, it clearly states that the legislature of the state can check the accounts of the corporation
 hisaab kar sakati he
 The mayor could not tell this
 kejariwal ne kaha ki north emsidi ko vigyaapan se 17 karod aata he, jabaki 25 guna zyaada aana chahie
 Mayor of North MCD said that by showing Kejriwal, you earn 25 times money from advertising department and show us that we have no objection
 agar kejariwal ne vaaki ye vibhaag maang liya to
 i do not know whether Ravindra Gupta is really serious about this challenge or said in sentiment
 tippaniyan Mayor Ravindra Gupta said that the Delhi government says that the DDA should pay the money first
 is prakaar kii baat ek maansik rogi kar saktaa he
 The Mayor of East MCD said that the Fourth Finance Commission report should come into force soon
 dilli sarkaar ne 2 disambar ko yah report sweekaar kar lee thi or kaha tha ki report ke sujhaavon ke anuvaasar jab bhi centre ise lagu maan legaa, dilli sarkaar bhi maan legi
 In Bengaluru, Chief Minister Kejriwal made several allegations of corruption on the MCD, in response to which the Mayor said that more than half of the officers are recruited inside Delhi Municipal Corporation through Delhi Kejriwal
 aapaki sarkaar ke madhyam se
 If someone is doing corruption then we are doing it or Delhi government? Delhi government officials are committing corruption
 pehali baar pataa chalaa he ki dilli nagar nigam main bhrashtachar isliye he ki uske afasaron-karmchaariyon kii niyukti dilli sarkaar ne kii he
 i think this formula should be patented
 raajnneeti aam aadmi party bhi kar rahi he
 Kejriwal said that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections are being held after one year and his party is going to win
 ek saal pehle hi jeetne kaa elaan kar rahe hai
 If now they can give 550 crores as loan and 142 crores as stamp duty, then why not already given it
 abhi tak centre banaam dilli kii is ladaai main yahi ahsaas karaayaa jaataa tha ki dilli ke paas koi adhikaar nahin he

 Voting for the general election in Israel on September 17, Benjamin Netanyahu is eyeing the pm's chair for the fifth time
 The Israeli public will use their vote for the second time in 6 months
 yahaan par 17 sitambar ko vot daale jaaenge
 The voting is taking place after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a coalition government after the election in April
 benjamin netanyahu agar is baar phir jeet hasil kar lete hai to wo paanchavin baar pradhanmantri banenge
 Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, faces former military chief Benny Gantz
 gantj ne isroyal ke purv vitt mantri or tivi personality yair lapid ke saath centrist blue and white gathbandhan kaa netritv kiya
 India is also eyeing Israel's election
 centre kii modi sarkaar benjamin netanyahu ke phir se piem banane kii kaamana karti hogi
 Because if Netanyahu becomes PM again, there will be no need to build relationships anew
 piem modi or benjamin netanyahu kii dosti puri duniya jaanati he
 The relationship between the two countries is very good
 donon deshon ke haalia varshon main aarthik, sainya, samrik sambandh bahut oonche str par pahunch gaye hai
 PM Narendra Modi had a historic victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when Benjamin Netanyahu was the first among the global leaders to congratulate him
 vahiin isroyal main aam chunaavon ke bich ek binar bhi khub viral hua
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu were seen together in the banner

 This banner was placed outside a building

 It is believed that the results will be similar to the elections held in April
 isroyal ke sthaneey media ne pichley hafte 2 pole survey kiye the
 According to this, the Likud Party is getting 32 seats, which is just one more than Blue and White
 isroyal main kabhi bhi koi ek party akele sarkaar banane main safal nahin rahi he
 In such a situation, it is common practice to form a coalition government here
 sabase adhik siten jeetne vaali party ke netaa ko aamtaur par nai sarkaar banane ke liye isroyal ke raashtrapati nimantran dete hai
 If the leader fails to bring more and more parties together to get 61 seats, then the president gives another chance
 is vajah se party kaa netaa jo chunaav jeeta ho jaruri nahin he ki vahi pradhanmantri banegaa
 To become Prime Minister, Netanyahu needs the support of right-wing groups, so that he can form a government with 61 seats
 vahiin gantz ko bahumat paane ke liye centre-left blox or arab joint list ke samarthan kii jarurat hogi
 But according to a recent poll by Israeli media, Netanyahu is projected to get 56 seats, while Gantz's party may get 55 seats

 dilli sarkaar ne faisla liya he ki ab maithili-bhojpuri bhashaa main ulkheneey kaam karne vaale shakhsiyaton ko bhi sammaan diya jayega
 He said that there are awards in Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, but there were no awards for those who worked in literature, art, journalism etc

 Sisodia further appealed to the central government that when the present central government came to power in 2014, it had said that it would bring Bhojpuri to the eighth schedule of the constitution, but it has not happened so far
 iske liye maithili-bhojpuri academy ke chairman ke taur par main centre sarkaar ko likh rahaa hum ki vah bhojpuri ko samvidhan kii aathvin anusuchee main shaamil karen

" ’’ The electoral atmosphere in Uttar Pradesh is so hot that the BJP accused the Samajwadi Party government of discrimination in power distribution
 vahiin akhilesh yadav kaa daawa he ki upi main bijli 24 ghante di ja rahi he
 At the same time, now the BJP has got a new weapon to attack the claim of 24-hour power supply in the state
 kendriya urja mantri piyush goyal ghusabad sthit party ke media centre main pressvarta kar rahe the
 They were attacking the Akhilesh Yadav government of the state for not giving enough power to the people and the facts of discrimination in connection
 piyush goyal ne jaise hi electranik media ko bite deni shuru kii to achaanak bijli chali gai
 What was then, BJP leaders including Union Minister Piyush Goyal started tightening the knot
 kai logon ne maukey par yah bhi kah diya ki ‘haath kangan ko aarasi kya
 
 ’
 The comments bijli mantri piyush goyal ne media se baatcheet main apane aaropon ke sambandh main khub aankade pesh kiye
 In a reply, he said that after conducting a probe in eight villages of Moradabad MP Sarvesh Kumar, it has been confirmed that the Akhilesh Yadav government has distributed electricity connections in the name of caste and religion
 goyal ne kaha ki kai saansadon kii ore se shikaayatein ai hai
 Rupees have also been taken in the name of connection to the poor
 piyush goyal ne kaha ki centre main bijepi kii sarkaar na ai hoti to uttar pradesh ke vidyutikaran main teji na dikhaai detii

 basapa ne baad ke apane teen varsh ke kaarykaal main maatr 79 nae gaanvon tak bijli pahunchaai thi
 When the SP government came, it slept for the first two years
 baad ke varshon main maatr 62 nae gaanvon tak bijli pahunchaai
 If the BJP formed a government at the Center, then rural electrification was focused on the Centre's suggestion
 varsh 2015-16 main hamane 1305 nae gaanvon tak bijli pahunchaai
 After the formation of our government, we sent officials from the center and through this system and department, reached power to 21404 hamlets

 Piyush Goyal said that the Prime Minister's plan is that by August 15, 2022, everyone should get uninterrupted power for 24 hours

 The Uttar Pradesh government has not signed on yet

 Bollywood actress Gracie Singh, actors Ranveer Shorey, Rajpal Yadav and director Suman Ganguly have returned to Mumbai after shooting for several hours in the midst of a fierce six-degree low temperature and chilling winds due to cold winds
 Remembering that his hair is still standing
 film blue mountain kii shooting haal main shimla or kufri main puri hui he
 During this time, the temperature was below zero to six degrees on many occasions
 nirdeshak suman ganguli ne barfili vaadiyon ke khubasurat nazaaron ko camere main kaid kar sweetsraland ko peeche chhodane kaa daawa bhi kiya he
 Blue Mountain director Suman Ganguly said, 'many producers-directors of Bollywood are afraid of shooting in areas like Shimla, Kufri, Narkanda during the snowy season because the weather is not known and the Bollywood actors are not easy to bear
 
 lekin, meraa anubhav behad shandaar rahaa
 The weather may not have fully supported me, but with the cast and unit members, i have captured those scenes on camera, which would make it impossible to distinguish between Switzerland and Shimla
 is romaanchak anubhav ke baad ranvir shouri ko mumbai main bhi thand kaa anubhav ho rahaa he
 He says, 'so i have also shot in Ladakh during the target, where there was a low temperature but icy winds made the weather of Shimla and Kufri extremely dangerous
 abhi bhi mujhe us thand kii yaad aate hi kapakpi hone lagati he
 On the occasion, actress Gracie Singh said, 'there is no doubt that even thinking of shooting in this season is an act of courage
 achaanak barf girane lagati or thandi hawaaen bheetar tak hilaa deteen
 So the second moment the weather starts getting clear
 'film kii kahani kaa centre shimla he
 The director was yet to film the second part of the film, which is to be shown with icy debris
 film kii kahani kii yah zarurat he
 Therefore, there is no question of worrying about the weather
 haa, nirdeshak or takneekiciyanon ne jis jazbe kaa parichay diya he,wo kaabil-e-tarif he
 Significantly, due to the severe cold, many producers-directors have changed their intention of shooting in Shimla and the surrounding areas
 lekin, suman ganguli apni puri unit ke saath jame rahe
 He was seen shooting in icy plains
 is bich,kufri main to kalakaar barf ke bich funs bhi gaye, jinhen mashkkat kar nikaala gaya
 But, all the actors are quite happy with the kind of shots taken for the film
 film blue mountain kii shooting kaa doosraa charan isi maheene mumbai main shuru hoga

 com / 85c15pdif4 baba ramdev ne naam liye bina congress mahasachiv digvijay singh par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki ‘vah peeche se ghinaune aarope lagaana band karen or media ke saamne hamase sidhe sawaal jawaab karen
 Referring to some of the allegations leveled by Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh, Ramdev told reporters, "these Congress General Secretaries violated all the limitations, hatched a vile conspiracy against us and even accused me of missing my Guru
" ’samvaadadaataaon dwaara baar-baar poochne par bhi ramdev ne congress mahasachiv kaa naam nahin liya, lekin jitne bhi sandarbh diye usase unka ishaara saaf taur par digvijay singh kii ore tha
 Ramdev said that it is the same general secretary, at whose behest, stones were thrown at my car in Madhya Pradesh and who often surround him on charges
 yogaguru ne kaha ki unke guru ko laapata karne kaa aarope un par lagaaya gaya jabaki 2007 main unke guru kii gumshudagi ke maamle main uttarakhand police kii antim report main kaha gaya he ki yah maamla lambey samay se lambit he or isamen bhavishya main bhi kuch pataa chalane kii sambhaavna najar nahin aati
 Significantly, after the police action on Ramdev's supporters at Ramlila Maidan last year at midnight, Digvijay Singh alleged that Ramdev's hand is in the disappearance of his mentor
 ramdev ne ravivaar ko kaha ki jab 2007 main mujhe apane guru kii gumshudagi kaa pataa chalaa tha to main landan main tha or maine uttarakhand ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri bi si khandudi se baat kii thi
 He said, 'such irresponsible allegations have been made not once or twice a thousand times
 ’ramdev ne congress mahasachiv par tikhaa hamalaa karte hue kaha, ‘main apane guru ke bare main aisa kaise soch saktaa hum
 Seems like their thinking is bad
 unhone apane bade-bujurgon ke saath aisa kiya hoga
 'yogguru alleged that a person of criminal instinct was named' Pushparaj Shar Ma aka Pushp Shukla ' for conspiring against him 
 ramdev ke mutabik is vyakti ke khilaaf sansad maarg thane main blakemeling kaa maamla darj he
 Ramdev said that he gathered information about the man through internet
 baba ne kaha, ‘aapraadhik pravriti ke pushparaj ke khilaaf namjad praathmiki darj karaayenge or karrwai kii maang karenge
 'he alleged that this man lured people to record false statements against me
 ramdev ne 2010 main apane sanghathan ke ek kaaryakarta rajeev dikshit ke chhattisgarh main nidhan kii ghatana kaa bhi ullekh karte hue kaha ki rajeev kii maut ke liye bhi unhen jimmedaar tehraaya gaya jabaki maujuud ricard se spasht he ki unki maut beemaari se hui
 Ramdev claimed that the files in the hospitals where Rajiv was treated and all the doctors who treated him are present
 unke paas bhi ricard hai jo bataate hai ki rajeev kii maut dil kii beemaari se hui
 Yogguru said, 'we have never adopted double standards in our public and private life
 nijee jivan kaa astitv hi samaapt kar diya
 But such allegations have been leveled against us which we cannot even think of
 divangat rajeev bhai kii maut main hamaara kya swaarth ho saktaa he
 "he said," We challenge the accusers through the media to stop abusive and shoddy accusations by abusing agencies like cowards and speak up
 ’ramdev ne yah bhi kaha, ‘main congress adhyaksh (sonia gandhi) se anurodh karuunga ki jab unki party aisi vipattiyon or ghotaalon main ghiri he to yaa to aise logon ko saath rakhane ke bare main phir se sochen yaa unke bayanon kii jimmedaari congress party khud le

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi's first claim about the assembly elections in Chhattisgarh seems to be hollow
 do maheene pehle rahul gandhi ne durg main yojit kaaryakarta sammelan main elaan kiya tha ki 15 agast se pehle party aadhi se zyada vidhansabha siton par apane ummidavaaron kii ghoshnaa kar degi
 Not only this, for the first time after becoming Congress President, Rahul Gandhi had expressed his intention on the process of candidate selection while dealing with the Congress workers in the fort
 rahul gandhi ne yah bhi bataaya tha ki ab kaise party main upyukt ummidavaaron kaa chayan kiya jayega or hawa hawaii netaaon kii jagah damakham or janaadhar vaale kaaryakartaaon ko 15 agast ke pehle hi unhone chunavi maidan main utaara jayega
 But in any case it does not seem that this claim of Rahul Gandhi will prove to be true
 15 agast ke liye ab haftaa bhar hi baaki he, aise main rahul gandhi ke is vaade ko lekar congressi netaaon ke bich gahamaa gahami he
 The whole process may take a month's time, and on the other hand, the initial process of candidate selection within the Congress has started now, Block Congress committees are submitting candidates' applications these days
 in aavednon ko ikattha kar pehle jila congress cameti phir pradesh congress cameti or phir vahaan se chunaav sanchaalan cameti se lekar eisisi tak main ummidavaaron ke naamon par vichaar hoga or antim muhar lagegi
 Only then will the party announce its candidates
 jaahir he is puri prakiya main ek maheene kaa vakt lag saktaa he
 In such a situation, the claim of the announcement of more than half the candidates before the 15th of August, Congress President Rahul Gandhi, does not seem to be fulfilled
 is par congress pradesh prabharee piel puniya ne bhi apni muhar laga di he
 According to him, the Congress will announce the names of the candidates for all the 90 seats next month
 sitambar ke pehle yaa duusare saptaah tak sabhi naamon kaa elaan kar diya jayega
 PL Punia gave this information in a statement on Monday
 unhone bataaya ki pradesh congress cameti eisisi ko agast ke ant tak sabhi siton par pratyaashiyon ke naam bhej degi
 The Congress made a change in its strategy
 For the first time in the history of Congress in Chhattisgarh, the party has decided to release the list of its candidates long before the code of conduct is imposed
 apni puraani ranneeti ke tahat congress mukhyavipakshi dalon ke ummidavaaronki ghoshnaa ke baad hi apane ummidavaaron ko chunavi maidan main utaarti thi, lekin ab party ne apni ranneeti main badlaav kiya he
 In the review of the defeats in the last assembly and Lok Sabha elections, it was revealed that due to the delay in the announcement of candidate selection, their candidates got very little time for campaigning, while other opposition parties including BJP announced their candidates
 And had started campaigning long ago
 aise main congress alaakaman ne apniranneeti main badlavkarte hue chunaav se kuch maheene pehle pratyaashiyon ke naamon kii ghoshnaa karne kii yojana banaai thi, lekin yah yojana dhari kii dhari rakhi dikhaai de rahi he
 According to party sources, if the candidate is not selected soon, the situation will be the same as before
 adhikrut ummidavaaron ko chunaav prachaar ke liye paryaapt vakt nahin mil paayegaa or ve ranneetik chook kaa shikaar honge
 At present, Rahul Gandhi is waiting impatiently in Raipur

 The party will begin assembly elections from this new building
 lihaaja congressi netaaon kaa ek samooh rahul gandhi se milakar 15 agast ke pehle hi kam se kam kuch pramukh daavedaaron kii siton par vichaar kar unke naamon ke elaan kaa anurodh karenge

 We want to continue the alliance with PDP
 'jammu kashmir ke logon ko nai sarkaar ke liye or intjaar karnaa padegaa

 mufti said ke nidhan ke baad se mahabuuba ke hi satta sanbhaalane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 Despite the end of state mourning, the case stuck with his not taking oath
 ravivaar ko mahabuuba mufti ne isharon main kaha ki vah jammu-kashmir main nae sire se chunaav karwaanaa pasand karengi
 Mehbooba said during the party meeting that i will stick to the core ideology of PDP, even if i remain alone, i can go back to the people

 BJP is confident of forming the government, according to the central leaders of the BJP, they have not officially reached any condition of Mehbooba
 bijepi ko ab bhi puraa bharosa he ki ve pidipi ke saath rajya mendobaraa sarkarbana lenge
 Their leaders believe that in the last 10 months there is no need for any promise due to 'coalition agenda'

 He formed an alliance with BJP, the second largest party with 25 seats to form the government

 supreme court kii bench ne tay kiya he ki talaak die jane kekanoonki samiksha kii jaaegi
 The Supreme Court will find out whether a divorce can be granted even without a mandatory period of separation of 18 months in those broken marriages where there is no scope for a re-settlement
 saalon se supreme courtsanvidhanke anuchhed 142 ke tahat apane adhikaron kaa istemaal kar rahaa he or talaak bhi pradaan kar chukaa he
 Whereas under the Hindu Marriage Act, in order to get a divorce even by mutual consent, the first husband and wife have to fulfill the condition of separation for at least 18 months
 anuchhed 142 ke tahat supreme court ke paas yah 'puraa nyaay karne ke liye' koi bhi aadesh jari karne kaa adhikaar he
 Using this same power, the Supreme Court has granted a divorce in some cases after setting aside a 6-month waiting period after a one-year judicial term of separation
 haalanki centre sarkaar supreme court ko yah bataa chuki he ki uskaa talaak ke kanoon main talaak dene ke liye ek shart ke taur par un tut chuki shaadiyon ko shaamil karne kaa koi iraadaa nahin he, jinamein dobaaraa samjhaute kii gunjaaish nahin hoti
 Now the Bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and NV Ramana have decided to review this law and find out whether the judges can decide above the will of the legislature
 pehle chaar rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main haar or phir loksabhaa chunaavon main supada saaf hone se congress alaakaman halkaan tha
 Now the unexpected revolt of the party people has put him in a panic
 aise main lagata nahin ki abhi party kaa bura daur tham gaya he
 Something similar happened in Rajasthan
 pichley dinon pradesh main loksabhaa chunaavon kii haar ke baad feedback baithak hui
 State Congress President Sachin Pilot, State In-charge Gurudas Kamat and Leader of Opposition Rameshwar Doody were present in it
 baithak main churu se loksabhaa pratyaashee rahe pratap puniyaan ne apni haar ke liye bhanvaralaal sharma, master bhanvaralaal or makabool mandelia ko jimmedaar bataaya
 Due to this, Bhanwarlal Sharma, MLA from Sardarshahar of Churu, blamed the high command for the defeat of the Congress
 do kadam aage badhate hue sharma bole, ‘‘rahul gandhi congressi sarkas kaa emdi he or uske sahyogi joker
 He raised the question that after the defeat of Congress in the state, State President Dr
 chandrabhan ko party ne hataa diya tha, ab rahul ko bhi upaadhyaksh pad se istipha de dena chahie
 Sharma cites party leader c
 pi
 Targeting Joshi, Ashok Gehlot, Bhanwar called Jitendra Singh as Rahul's Yes Man and Digvijay Singh who played a key role in submerging the Congress
 unhone party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko bhi nahin bakhsha
 He said that Sonia has become Dhritarashtra in Putramoh
 aise main sharma kaa party se nilamban tay tha or aisa hua bhi
 But after the suspension, he became more furious and said, "I will deal with the Congress, which Lord Parashuram did with Sahasrabahu
 ’’ darasal sharma jaanate hai ki party abhi unhen nishkasit karne kii himmat nahin dikhaa sakati
 The Congress has just 21 mlas in the 200-member assembly
 agar sharma jate hai to ve apane saath kuch vidhayakon ko todakar le ja sakate hai
 Due to decreasing strength, the party will not be able to remain an opposition party
 isse or kisi ko fark pade yaa na pade, vipaksh ke netaa rameshwar dudi ko jarur padegaa
 So Doody approached Sharma and requested him not to make rhetoric on the high command
 (churu jile ke sardarshahar se congress ke nilambit vidhayak bhanvaralaal sharma)siyaasi gotiyaan khelkar 70 varsh kii umr paar kar chuke sharma ke bare main bijepi bhi jaanati he ki ve ulatpher karne main maahir hai
 He also tried to topple the government of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat
 shekhavat kursi bachaane main safal ho gaye the, par sharma phir congress main aa gaye
 Recently, Sharma has also met Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 ve is mulaakaat ko nahari pani kii maang se jodate hai, lekin yah bahaanaa kisi ke gale nahin utar rahaa
 While in BJP and Congress, Sharma became MLA a total of six times
 1990-1992 ke bich ve mantri bhi rahe hai
 Not being able to be the leader of the opposition and not getting a ticket in the Lok Sabha elections is also a big reason for his insurgency
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki apni aakraamakata kii vajah se ve apane peeche samarthak nahin jod paae

 Sahasrabuddhe has been warning engineering colleges of the country even before the academic session 2016-17 begins
 ve satark karte hai, ''ejineering kii kareeb 17 lakh siton main se kam se kam 1,00,000 siten khatm ho jaaengi
 Around 100 colleges will be closed across the country while 200 new colleges are open in 2015-16
 " ''drop out" dar badaae kaa andeshaa he kyonki kai college pehle hi bandi kii ore agrasar hai
 Admission is closed and waiting for the current batch to pass
 shuruaati rujhaan bhi 2016-17 main ejineering kii padhai main acchhee-khaasi giravat kii chetavanee de rahe hai
 In particular, there are few who seek admission in states where many colleges have grown in the last two decades
 telugana main 83 ejineering collejon ko manyata dene se inkaar kar diya gaya, duusare 35 collejon ko maanakon ke anuroop prayogshaala or duusari suvidhaon kaa vistaar karne sambandhi notice thama diya gaya or 58 anya collejon ne 2016-17 ke liye hyderabad kii jawaharlal nehru technological uniwarsity (jeentiyu-ech) se apni sambhddhata kaa navinikaran na karaane kaa faisla kiya he
 Some of these colleges have already closed and some have leased their campuses to private institutions or schools

 Says Yadaiya, "the sudden closure of colleges will affect students' careers

 The middle class desperate to kiss heights is also trending towards medical studies

 Significantly, in the academic session 2015-16, out of 1,60,000 engineering seats in the state, almost 64,000 seats were not filled
 yahi sthiti pashchim bengal kii bhi he, jahaan har paanch main se do seat khaali raheen
 When it was seen that the seats were lying vacant and only 15,000 out of 88,000 students from the Common Entrance Examination (GEE) enrolled through counseling, the state authorities relaxed the admission rules to such an extent that in the eligibility test Those who get 40 per cent marks and rank in JEE can take admission
 iske baavjood 40,000 siton main se sirf 26,000 hi bhar pain
 Reputed institutes like Yadavpur University, Bengal Engineering College and Science University were also left vacant, as there was no one to enroll in the most demanding subjects like mining and metallurgy

 Admissions to AICTE accredited colleges are also being affected

 Administrative mess, crumbling infrastructure, illegitimate fees and shortage of teachers have also reduced the level of engineering education
 maharashtra 365 collejon ke saath sabase adhik ejineering collejon ke maamle main tamilnadu ke baad duusare number par he
 Yet the same fact gives an idea of the fact that 346 out of 365 are facing the action of AICTE for violation of the rules of recognition
 eysitii ke niyam classroom, workshop, prayogshaala, librari, drawing haul, jameen kaa aakaar or chaatr-shikshak anupaat har maamle main ekadam saaf hai
 As per the rules, colleges have to get affiliation with the Department of Technical Education (DTE), a local university and the state's highest institution on engineering, every year before obtaining final approval of accreditation (EOA) from AICTE
 koi ejineering college ioe hasil karne ke pehle chaatro kaa daakhila nahin le saktaa
 But it is often found that the information given to obtain EOA from AICTE does not match the ground reality

 But there are some young businessmen from the city of Jodhpur in western Rajasthan who keep thinking about the junk from day to day
 teen saal pehle tak shahar main jisaki koi kadra hi na thi, vahi kabad aaj karodpati banane kaa mul mantra ban gaya he
 If not sure, ask Ritesh Lohia (39), owner of Preeti International, Jodhpur, and colleague wife Preeti (37)
 lohia dampati ko kabad itnaa raas aa gaya ki ab ve niryaat ke apane mul vyavsaay furniture handicraft par dhyaan bhi nahin de rahe
 They are always involved in junk of junk
 isaki thos vajah he

 kabad kaa yah jugad aakhir he kya? isaki shuruyaat asal main hoti he 2009 se
 The business recession of that era hit all big and small businessmen
 furniture handicrafts kaa niryaat karne vaali priti international usase achhuti na rahi
 On one of those bad days, one of his customers from Denmark came to the Lohia couple
 vah godaam main furniture dekh rahaa tha ki uski najar ek tin par padi jis par kisi majdoor ne galati se kapade se bani gaddi rakh di or vah antic kursi dikhne lagi
 The idea was so pleasing to the customer that he advised Lohia to make similar products out of useless things
 mandi kii maar main khamosh baithe lohia dampati kaa bhi dimag daudane laga
 Tin wastes were collected and thousands of jugaad stools were sent abroad
 america or australia kii maang to puri bhi nahin ho rahi
 There is no paint, no color on ghee or oil containers

 Such antique cushions were made that it became difficult to supply them

 main bhi hamen nahin de rahe hai
 '' That is, even the rubbish are getting rich
 lohia ab stool ke alaava sopha, kursiyaan, baar kursi / teble, aalmaari, dari, karpet, bedshit, takie jaise tamaam gharelu utpaada videsh bhej rahe hai

 One aspect of this business is that all the work is done by hand instead of machine
 is vajah se laagat bhale thodi zyada lagati ho par rojgaar ke bhi raste khule hai
 Manish Bansal (35) of The Home, another firm that makes quality products from junk, says, "machines have no use in this far and wide
 ''bansal bhi 2009 main is dhandhe main koode or in utpaadon ne unke kaarobaar ko 2 karod ru

 After taking out the workable part of the cloth and adding the remaining pieces, the workers got the work of embroidery and zari on that big cloth

 Significantly, the Chauhatan village of Barmer is fully connected to the work of patchwork
 yahaan har ghar main ek, do yaa phir puraa parivaar packwork kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 500–700 people are getting work through patchwork alone
