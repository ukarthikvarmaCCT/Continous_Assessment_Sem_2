 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke baad manish sisodiya ne bhi shanivaar ko doharaaya ki star cricketer, camentator or bijepi se rajyasabha saansad rahe siddhu se aam aadmi party kii baat abhi bigadi nahin he
 Sidhu has asked for a little more time to think
 haalanki sutara bataate hai ki siddhu or kejariwal ke rishton kaa dahi jamane se pehle hi donon main hiton ke takaraav kaa raita fail chukaa he
 Sidhu came to hold the dream of becoming the CM of Punjab with the Aam Aadmi Party and Kejriwal's Chinese Manjha cut his dream kite before flying
 AAP main siddhu ke judane par suspencesutra bataate hai ki andarkhaane khabar ye he kisiddhuna ghar ke rah gaye hai or naa ghat ke
 He has already resigned from bjp's Rajya Sabha membership and the Aam Aadmi Party has backed down from making him the chief ministerial candidate of Punjab
 ab jo deal navjot singh siddhu or unki patni ke paas rah gai he wo ye he ki aam aadmi party chunaav jeetne ke baad siddhu kii patni ko cabinet main jagah degi or siddhu par jimmedaari hogi party ko centre main aage badhaane kii
 Now Congress has a better deal for Sidhu
 congress unki patni ko jeetne ke baad cabinet main jagah to degi hi, siddhu kii fevorett amritsar kii seat bhi
 Before Captain Amarinder Singh, Sidhu was an MP from Amritsar and under pressure from the Akalis, Sidhu did not get a ticket from Amritsar
 lekin sawaal ye he ki jis congress kii vichaardhaara or party ke khilaaf siddhu ne apane puure raajnneetik jivan bhar ladaai kii he, kya ab uskaa daaman thaamne se unke samarthak unhen nahin rokenge?siddhu par nahin chalegaa ankusham aadmi party main punjab chunaav par pichley saal bhar se kaam kar rahe sutara bataate hai ki siddhu ke saath sabase bada negative point ye he ki wo adaalat main doshi qaraar die ja chuke hai
 According to the constitution of the Aam Aadmi Party, no such person can be given an election ticket, it is a distant thing to make a chief ministerial candidate
 doosraa nigetav point ye he ki siddhu bina ankush ke hathi hai
 Even in the BJP, his statements are without any doubt
 duusari taraf mukhyamantri banane ke saath-saath siddhu kii kuch or bhi sharten aisi thim jinpar kejariwal sahamat nahin hue
 After the demand for the post of Chief Minister, the biggest among them was the decisive opinion on the distribution of tickets in fixed numbers
 saath hi siddhu apni ek team ke saath aam aadmi party jwine karnaa chaahate the jisapar aap supremeo sahamat nahin hue
 So does Sidhu not belong anywhere? If the Aam Aadmi Party is not being formed with Sidhu and Sidhu's Aam Aadmi Party, then what is the option of the cricketer who has left the Rajya Sabha seat of BJP? The most attractive deal among the three parties is with the Congress, so will Sidhu go with the Congress after blunting his nationalist political thinking
 jaahir he ye vikalp chunanaa siddhu ke liye behad mushkil he
 Technically, Sidhu has resigned from the Rajya Sabha till now, not from the primary membership of the party, so should Sidhu save his rightful honor and return to BJP? This option is also no less than seeing the eyes, because no one knows better than him how much Sidhu's reputation will remain after his return to BJP
 teesraa vikalp aam aadmi party kii bachi khuchi deal lapet lene kaa bachataa he
 Whatever Kejriwal gives, he should become the flag bearer of Kejriwal's new politics
 punjab chunaavon main siddhu kii nai party?ek chauthaa vikalp ye bhi he ki punjab chunaavon main siddhu nayi party lekar utren or kejariwal kii sambhaavnaaon ko jamkar dent pahunchaaen, or apana shakti pradarshan kar bijepi ke kareeb bhi aa jaaen
 However, given the commitment of Sidhu to the entertainment industry and his habit of doing part-time politics, this option does not seem to be as practical for the star cricketer
 lekin hamen ye bhi nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki cricket or raajnneeti main kuch minuton main hi khel badal saktaa he

 Had this government conducted a proper investigation into the blast in Kolkata a year before the explosion here, the Bardaman blast would not have happened
 lekin vot bank kii raajnneeti kii khatir isaki uchit jaanch hi nahin karai
 Citing the example of the October 2 blast, Shah said, "even as the National Investigation Agency is involved in the investigation of the Bardaman blast, he (mamta) has objected to the investigation
" visphot ke liye mamata sarkaar javabdeh he
 'it is worth mentioning that jamaat-ul-mujahideen, the terrorist organization of Bangladesh, is involved in this blast

 "the president of the BJP, which has been targeting Bangladeshi infiltration from the time of Lok Sabha elections, said," The people of Bengal should not let this government (state) run for a day as it is hurting the security of the country
 'narendra modi sarkaar kii ore se vikaas ke liye hue prayaason ko ginate hue shah ne bengal se trinmul ko ukhaad phenkane kaa aahvaan kiya

 This is possible because the military camps are not as safe as they should have been
 yah baat sena bhi maanati he
 In front of the Parliamentary Committee on Defense Affairs, the Army has admitted that it does not have the required number of jawans to protect the camps
 uski zyaadaatar tukadiyaan seemaa par lagi hui hai
 Now there is a tussle between the Home Ministry and the Ministry of Defense regarding the safety of the camps
 sena kaa suzav he ki is kaam main local police or ardhsainik balon ko lagaaya jaae
 Whereas the IB suggests that army should employ trend dogs to protect the perimeter
 sena kaa kahana he ki prashikshit kute mil nahin rahe or nae kutton ko prashikshit karne main samay lagegaa
 However, the Defense Ministry has also constituted a committee which has given a report to the Ministry regarding the security of all the army camps

 There were terrorist attacks first at Pathankot, then Uri and then at the military bases of Nagrota
 yah isliye mumkin ho rahe hai kyonki sainya campon kii chauhaddi jitani surakshit honi chahie thi, utani nahin he
 The Army also believes this

 kris gail ne worldcup main shandaar batting karte hue aaj kai world record banaae
 Gayle played a brilliant innings of 215 against Zimbabwe which included 10 fours and 16 sixes
 worldcup ke itihaas main yah sabase zyada nijee score ke saath-saath sabase zyada chakke maarane kaa bhi record he
 Earlier, South Africa batsman David Miller had a record of hitting nine sixes in the World Cup
 kris gail ne aaj ke match main ek record or bhi banaaya
 At the World Cup, 136 runs came from the boundary, which is a world record
 isse pehle yah record saurabh ganguli ke naam tha
 Ganguly had scored an impressive 183 runs against Sri Lanka on 26 May 1999 and had taken 110 runs from the boundary which included 17 fours and seven sixes
 opening karne aae gail ne dhimi shuruyaat kii, lekin baad main behtareen batting karte hue zimbabwe ke boleron ko dho daalaa
 This is the first double century in the history of the World Cup
 lekin, agar worldcup chhod diya jaae to ek-divasiy match main rohit sharma ke naam sabase zyada ran banane kaa record he
 Rohit had scored an impressive 264 runs against Sri Lanka
 isse pehle bhi gail kaa sabase zyada nijee score ekadivasiy match main zimbabwe ke khilaaf tha
 In 2003, in the match between Zimbabwe and West Indies, Gayle scored an excellent innings of 153 runs
 jetali ke bajet main sabase bada sudhaar kya ho saktaa he, zyada jhanjhat main padane kii zarurat nahin he
 Just listen carefully to the paragraphs where the merger is being mentioned in the General Budget of the Railway Budget, because the biggest hope of Taj Maidan reforms is related to this merger
 is mugalate main haragij mat rahiye ki rail bajet kaa aam bajet main vilay apane aap koi bada sudhaar he
 This was actually the last option as the new Nizam of Railways could not stand India's largest transporter on its feet in the last two years, as a result of which it placed him on Jaitley's shoulder
 alabatta, is vilay se railway main un kathor sudhaaron kii shuruyaat honi chahie ki raajnneeti kaa tark dekar taala jaataa rahaa he
 In September last year, we were annoyed when we tried to find railway minister Suresh Prabhu to merge the general budget of the railway budget
 ham jaananaa chaahate the ki is vilay se railway ko kya hasil hoga or railway main kis tarah ke sudhaar prarambh honge
 But the railway minister wanted to tell that in any country of the world, why should there be a separate railway budget in India? However, in later months nothing concrete was heard about this merger and on the other hand, the rail network stretching from the corridors of the Rail Bhavan to the far-flung areas has increased enthusiasm and excitement about this merger
 baat sirf itani nahin ki bajet kii parampara band ho rahi he balki ise kahin aage jaakar railway ke sanchaalan, vittiya punargathan or swaittata se jude sawaal bhi hai jinka javaabon kaa besabri se intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The relationship between the Ministry of Railways and Finance is complex: §railway is not a company, yet pays dividends to the government
 railway ghate main he, isliye yah labhaansh nahin balki bajet se milane vaale karj par byaaj he
 On one hand the Railways pays "dividend" to the government and on the other hand takes help from the general budget
 yah madad railway network ke vistaar or aadhunikeekaran ke liye he, kyonki dainik kharchon, vetan, pension or byaaj chukaane ke baad railway ke paas network vistaar ke liye sansaadhan nahin bachate
 There are several companies under the Railways, which receive financial support from the Central Treasury separately
 §bajet se madad ke alaava railway ko baari karj lenaa padataa he, jiske liye indian railway finance korporation he
 Railways is the only government department in India which has a debt-raising company, which gives loan resources to railways for wagon-boxes etc
 §prabhu ke netritv main railway ne jivan beemaa nigam se bhi karj liya he, jo khaasaa mahangaa he
 What to say about the financial condition of the Railways: Suresh Prabhu squeezed out the two most profitable services of the Railways last year
 ·pehle koyale par maal haada badha
 About 50 percent of the railways' transportation revenue comes from coal
 phir premium trainon main sarj prising yani maang ke hisaab se mahange kiraaye badhaaye gaye·or is tarah gahare vittiya sankat main fansi railway apni pratispardhaatmakataa ko daanv par laga diya
 Railway is constantly becoming a company which wants to hand over its business (goods and passengers) to other areas so that the deficit can be reduced
 railway bajet kaa aam bajet main vilay utani badi baat nahin he zyada badi khabar to railway ke vah punargathan kaarykram honge jinka elaan (agar) bajet main hota he, kyonki bajaton ke vilay kaa makasad railway ko sarkari vibhaag main badalanaa haragij nahin ho saktaa
 Let's see the five reforms that need to be announced with the merger of the Railway Budget into the General Budget - First: the separation of social responsibilities of the Railways from commercial business and transparent subsidies from the budget for social services through accounting reforms
 After the financial services of the railway will be saved
 jisamen laagat ke hisaab maal haada or kiraaya badhaane kii niti or swatantra kiraaya niamak kaa gathanatin-railway ke aspataal or skulon kaa vinievesh taaki taaki kharch batch sake or sansaadhan mil saken
 Based on the recommendations of the char-debroy committee, the transport operations and infrastructure of the railways should be converted into separate companies and a holding company for the public sector undertakings of the railways will be listed on the stock market through private investment or disinvestment in five new railway companies
 Be it done as it was done by changing the Department of Telecom Services to BSNL
 november main rail mantri ke banane ke saath suresh prabhu pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye railway ke manmohan singh ban sakate the, kyonki railway kii haalat 1991 se pehle kii bhartiya arthvyavastha jaisi he
 In 1991, India's economy was full of competition, full of financial crisis, full of government monopoly in which the entry of new technology and rapid change was forbidden
 suresh prabhu ko railway main krantikari badlaav karne the lekin unhone bajet hi vitt mantri ko saunp diya
 Well! Sick, ravaged, accident-prone railways is now the responsibility of the Finance Minister, in which the people sitting are also dreaming of bullet trains

 bajet milan ke baad railway ko waapas companykaran kii taraf lautnaa hoga taaki ise vanijyik or saamaajik rup se laabhprad or sakasham banaaya ja sake
 There are already different companies for coach wheel, engine, catering, reservation, formation of companies for the largest operations i

 bijepi netaa uma bharti ne wallmart storon ko aag ke hawaale kar dene kii apni vivaadaaspad chetavanee ko doharaate hue kaha ki somvaar ko uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri mayawati ko bhi bhrashtachar ke maamle main jail bheja ja saktaa he
 State Chief Minister and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) President Mayawati has also opposed foreign direct investment in retail sector
 bharti ne kaha, 'wallmart storon ko aag ke hawaale karne par jab mujhe jail ho sakati he to mayawati ko bhi janata ke paise kaa galat istemaal karne va bhrasht gatividhiyon ke liye jail bheja ja saktaa he
 'they said,' Both of us can be sent to jail for different reasons
 ek ko garibon kii madad karne ke liye or duusare ko unke saath dhokhaa karne ke liye
 She alleged that Mayawati was trying to present herself as the messiah of the poor by falsely opposing FDI in retail
 bharti ne kaha ki khud mayawati puunjipatiyon se niyantrit hoti hai or rajya main garibon ko luutane main lipt hai
 He said that therefore his opposition to foreign direct investment cannot be compared with Mayawati's opposition
 unhone mayawati ko daliton or pichhadi jatiyon kaa dushman bataate hue kaha, 'khud ke daliton kii sangrakshak hone kaa daawa karne ke baad bhi vah apane samudaay ke logon va pichhadi jatiyon ke liye kaam karne main asafal rahi hai
 Mayawati has also failed to provide justice to Dalit women, but was further targeted during her rule
 ' unhone kaha, 'mayawati sarkaar pathar ke hathi (basapa kaa chunaav chihn) kii tarah bahut samvedanheen he
 Just as this elephant cannot move, Mayawati also has no feelings for the poor and the disadvantaged
 ' After the polling in Himachal Pradesh on Thursday, the focus will be entirely on the Gujarat elections
 gujarat chunaav par sirf desh kii hi nahin duniya kii nazren tiki hai
 This election is a question of credibility for the BJP, especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while the Congress also wants to try every arrow in the hope of returning to power in Gujarat after 22 years
 congress kii koshish he ki gujarat main poda (PODA) ke sahare chunavi baitarani paar kii jaae
 The meaning of 'poda' in Tamil is 'chal Hut'
 lekin gujarat chunaav ke liye iskaa matlab he, P-patidaar, O-obisi, D-dalit or A-adivasee
 The Congress is pushing for a heel, that this caste equation should make the BJP 'poda' from power in Gujarat
 ye baat duusari he ki congress ke paas poda ko saadhane ke liye khud party main in jatiyon se damdaar netaa nahin the
 In such a situation, the Congress is working on a strategy of defeating the BJP through 'congressisation' by choosing the strong leaders of these castes from outside
 darasal, congress ne is saal ke shuru main uttar pradesh chunaav se sabak lete hue yah tay kiya ki wo puri koshish karegi kigujarat ke chunaav kosampradayik dhruvikaran kii line par kisi surat main naa jane diya jaae
 The Congress knows very well that if this happens, the BJP will knock it out
 yahi vajah he ki congress or rahul gandhi ne gujarat ke liye beete kai hafte se ‘soft hindutv’ kii line pakadi hui he
 Rahul Gandhi was seen visiting the temples of all the Gods and Goddesses every time he went for publicity in Gujarat, took blessings from the Mahants and was seen doing aarti in the Nav Durga pandals
 duusari taraf, rahul bharuch main alpsankhyak bahul ilaakon main gaye bhi to unke kisi dharmasthal kaa rukh nahin kiya
 On the whole, the Congress' effort seems clear that the BJP should not be given any opportunity to take the Gujarat election on the hindu-muslim line
 congress gujarat ke liye do staron vaala plan le kar chal rahi he
 On the upper hand, Rahul Gandhi, who is commanding the Congress, should be seen holding the flag of 'soft Hindutva', taking steps in the same direction
 rahul aisa kar bhi rahe hai
 At the same time, the attempt of the inner Congress congress is to use the weapon of casteism without making any noise to break the spirit of Hindutva
 yahi vajah he ki congress patidaar, obisi, dalit or adivasee netaaon ko aage kar in jatiyon ke voton ko apane haq main sadhana chaahati he
 In the case of formulas based on caste equations, MY (ie Muslim and Yadav) made a lot of headlines in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 gujarat kii baat kii jaae to congress ke maujuuda pradesh adhyaksh bharat singh solanki ke pita madhav singh solanki ne 1985 ke rajya vidhansabha chunaav main KHAM (kshatriya, harijan, adivasee, muslim) kaa daanv khelaa tha
 In that election of Gujarat, Congress won 149 seats
 haalanki us jeet ke liye 1984 main indira gandhi kii hatya se congress ke liye upji sahanubhuti lahar ke tathy ko bhi nazarandhaaz nahin kiya ja saktaa
 As the 2017 version of 'kham' itself, Congress is betting on 'poda' in Gujarat
 congress ko lagata he ki ‘khaam’ main muslim ahm hissaa the to ‘poda’ main patidaar hai
 The Patidars have traditionally been considered to be the backbone of the BJP, so the Congress is focused on bringing them to its side
 jahaan tak muslimon kii baat he to congress maan kar chal rahi he, muslim bijepi ke khilaaf uskaa hi saath denge
 How effective 'poda' is will depend more on the Congress' own charisma than the extent to which Patidar leader Hardik Patel, OBC leader Alpesh Thakor, Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani and tribal leader Chhotu Singh Vasava can infiltrate their castes Can be converted into votes in favor of Congress
 chotu singh vasava vahiin vidhayak hai jinke vot ne congress ke diggaj ahamed patel ko gujarat se haalia rajyasabha chunaav main jeet dilaai thi
 Vasava is a JDU MLA to say but now he is not with Nitish Kumar but with Sharad Yadav camp
 ‘MY’ ho, ‘KHAM’ ho yaa phir congress kaa gujarat ke liye nayaa ‘PODA’, ye wo jaateey sameekaran hai jo chunaav main clic kar jate hai to barason tak jubaan par chadhe rahete hai
 And if proved to be a 'flop show', like the past, they are lost in political haze
 congress ke liye ‘poda’ kaa daanv hit rahegaa yaa flop, ye jaanane ke liye 18 disambar ko gujarat chunaav ke nattejey aane tak intjaar karnaa hoga

 banaras ke ek gaanv menhadipur main 2014 kii may main saikadon logon kaa mela laga hua tha
 Children, old men, women and men stood with folded hands covered in sweat
 jisase pucho bas vah mata ji kii ek jhalak paane ko bekaraar tha
 After all, who is this mother? As the crowd of people was increasing, my curiosity was also increasing
 aakhirkar intjaar khatm hua or mata ji sabake saamne thim
 But what is this? It was not a woman but a man
 logon kaa vishwaas tha ki inke sharir main mata ji pravesh kar jaati hai
 Male mothers were constantly banging their heads
 or aasapaas jai mata ji ke naare gunj rahe the
 Everyone present there was confident that Mother could eliminate all kinds of problems, including incurable disease, poverty
 inke itihaas ko khangaalane kii jigyaasa badi to poochtacha shuru kii
 Actually, Mata ji started coming to this person three years ago and then in every new age Mata ji used to ride on her
 log vahaan darshan ke saath baari-bharkam chadhaava lekar aane lage
 Three years ago this man living in a small house had already owned two bungalows
 unhone sarkari talab kii jameen mandir banaakar hathiyaa lee thi
 Children and wives, who were disenchanted with basic needs, were now living a life of prosperity
 par koi bhi unase nahin puch rahaa tha ki aakhir yah sab unke paas aayaa kahaan se ?kya us vyakti ko koi manovaigyanik beemaari thi yaa phir ve logon ko bargala rahe the? duusari baat ke sach hone kii sambhaavna zyada thi
 Is there really any psychosis in a person who does such a thing? ”says Pratibha Yadav, Senior Psychologist at Gyps Psychiatric Hospital and Dediction Center and Columbia Asia Hospital," In some cases the person is really psychotic but in most cases people Deliberately trick people
 darasal hamaare yahaan dharmik unmaad ek aisi beemaari he jisase aabaadi kaa ek bada hissaa grasit he
 People take advantage of this by making business of religion
 ab dekhie na haal hi main khabar ai ki chhattisgarh vidhansabha ke baahar ek tantric ne yah daawa kiya ki usne vidhansabha ko apni tantric shakti se baandh diya he
 Now no one can defeat the current Chief Minister
 unke saath vidhayak or mantriyon ne photo bhi khinchaae
 In such a country, when incidents like Burari happen, its religious, tantric, criminal and psychological strings are discovered
 yah baat sahi he ki buraadi jaisi ghatana ko koi saamaanya aadmi anjaam nahin de saktaa
 But the practice of getting entangled in one's own virtual world of religion also arises from the thinking that develops in society
 jahaan netaa, abhinayta, patrkaar or samaaj ke padhe-likhe tabake ke log aisi baton par bharosa karen to vahaan is tarah ke vishwaas apni jaden jamaa lete hai
 We accept the confusing thoughts as true and consider them as a message of some invisible power
 buraadi kii ghatana duniya kii rer of da reerest manovaigyanik ghatnaon main se ek he
 It is not that there are no examples of such incidents
 1978 main dakshin america ke jonestown, guyana main 918 logon ne gym jones naam ke christ ke folover ek dharmik guru ke saath apni jaan de di thi
 In 2013, in Rajasthan too, eight people ate poison mixed with sweets to meet Shiva
 phir bhi aisi ghatnaayen rer hi ghatati hai, par dharm ke jaal main funsane kii ghatnaayen to ghatati hi rahati hai
 Actually there is an unbridled faith created by pushing the logic behind the creation of false belief system
 or jab ghatana ghat jaati he to ham kisi tantric or baba ko dosha dekar sir peetate hai
 
 
 
 matibhram ne le lee 11 logon kii jaan, jaar sochen
 
 
 Somewhere in the case of Burari, Lalit was the victim of a mental illness that motivated 11 people to do religious work
 pita kii maut ke baad vahi ghar kaa mukhiya tha
 Therefore, all the people of the house believed his decision
 lekin uske bhram ko sach maanakar faansee ke fande ko gale main daalkar kisi paraloukik anubhuti kii kapol kalpana ne puure parivaar ko maut kii neend sula diya
 CP Khokhar, a psychology professor at Gurukul Kangri, says, "in fact, Lalit had the illness of the Delusion of Grandeur, the greatness of the Delusion and the Delusion of Persuasion, a conspiracy around himself
 ''lalit kuch awaajen sunata tha
 He also had the feeling of getting some instructions
 use lagata tha ki uske mrit pita kii aatma use kuch nirdesh detii he
 "he had been going through this state of mind for years," says Professor Khokhar
 magar baahar ke kisi vyakti ko iskaa ehsaas tak nahin hua
 This was due to his normal behavior outside the house
 ''use yah vaham tha ki vah kuch mahaan kaam kar rahaa he or agar usne kisi se apni baat saajha kii to uske is bade kaary main baadha daalane yaa haani pahunchane ke liye saare log ekajute ho jaaenge
 Professor Pokhar says, "it is an accident caused by mental illness
" lekin hamaare bilive system ko viksit karne main aasapaas kaa vaataavaran bhi mahatvapurn hota he
 Now, from childhood, we keep hearing the events like entering a soul in a body, coming to one's mother
 aise main hamaara avchetan man isaki kahaniyaan gadhane lagata he
 Children are taught not to ask questions where there is faith
 lekin jab hamaara avchetan man in kahaniyon ko sanak kii had tak sach maan letaa he to bhram or sach ke bich kii line khatm ho jaati he
 It is not known when normal faith turns into serious psychosis
 or agar parivaar main maansik vikruti kii history ho to phir aise vyakti ko jaise hi uske avchetan man kii kahaniyon ko khaad-pani miltaa he uski sanak badhati jaati he
 The Burari case is also strange to psychologists
 lekin iske peeche sanak kii had tak panpi aasthaa hi jimmedaar he
 Psychiatrist at Manthan Clinic in Gurugram, Dr
 vaani jain bhi ise puri tarah se helusination kaa cese maanati hai
 She says, "A chemical called dopamine is imbalanced in the brain causing hallucinations
" ''ye ek gambhir maansik beemaari sijophrenia kaa ahm lakshan he
 Professor Khokhar Burari explains the case in more detail, "in such cases a person has hallucinations, he shares his hallucinations with others in the family or nearby
 ''saamanyat: aasapaas ke log aisi baaten sunakar use kisi manovaigyanik yaa manochikitsak ke paas jane kii salaah dete hai
 But in this case, his family members became his followers
 ek tarah se use prophet yaa guru kii tarah treet karne lage
 This also happens when a mentally ill person dominates the surrounding people
 ab yahaan kyonki lalit hi puure ghar ko chalaata tha
 So people came under his influence or it may be that somewhere within the whole family there are some very correct symptoms of hallucination, due to which all this easily entered the world of Lalit and what Lalit said They can also call it Shared Psychosis
 professor khokhar kehete hai, is tarah kii maansik sthiti se guzar rahaa vyakti apni baaten unheen se share karata he jis par uskaa prabhaav hota he
 Lalit also lived outside like normal people
 par dow
 For Vani, this matter still remains an intriguing puzzle
 ve kahati hai, psychology main aise maamle jarur saamne aae hai jab pati-patni yaa bhai bahan ek saath helusination kaa shikaar ho gaye hon
 That is, there have been cases of two or three people who are victims of shared hallucinations
 lekin 11 log yah kuch zyada hi ajeeb he
 The whole truth will be revealed only after a thorough psychiatric investigation into the matter
 ab is maamle ke manovaigyanik pahalu ko samajhane ke liye mrit logon kii dimag kii sanrachana ko samajhnaa hoga
 The crime branch has also taken steps in this direction
 kya is tarah ke helusination or dilugen kaa shikaar hamaare bich se bhi kuch log ho sakate hai, jo hamaare saath saamaanya hon lekin ve ek abhaasi duniya ke bhi musafir hon? dow
 "exactly," says Khokhar
 "hamaare ird-gird bhi kuch log apni abhaasi duniya main ji rahe hon
 The reason for this is genetic or physical, as well as false beliefs and religious superstitions spread around us
 isliye hamen apane aasapaas aise bhram ko na failaana chahie or na failane dena chahie

 Describing corruption as the country's most burning issue, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said on Monday that the people of India are in favor of bringing back the country with the desire to know who belongs to the black money stashed abroad
 patna ke ek ane maarg sthit mukhyamantri awaas par yojit janata darbar ke baad samvaadadaataaon ko sambodhit karte huebhrashtacharco desh kaa sabase jwalanth mudda bataate hue kaha, ‘yahaan kaa dhan lootakar kuch log videshon main jamaa kiye hue hai, sab logon ke man main yahi baat uth rahi he hamen unka naam jaananaa chahie or jo dhan videsh main jamaa karaane ke liye bheja gaya he, vah waapas aana chahie
 Describing corruption as the biggest and most important issue, Nitish said that the people of the country are furious on this question and they are very angry
 unhone kaha ki ek taraf log jahaan manhagaai kii maar se pareshaan hai vahiin duusari taraf log bhrashtachar se bilkul oobe hue hai or tang aa chuke hai tathaa isko lekar aae din jo khabaren aati hai usase log pareshaan hai
 Nitish said that people sitting in the center should understand the writing on the wall and still take effective action against it
 ek prashn ke uttar main mukhyamantri ne kaha ki bhrashtachar ko lekar desh kii janata ke bich aakrosh jarur he par misr or bharat main fark he
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said, 'here the people have the greatest power in their hands and the people change the power through votes
 misr jaise halaat yahaan utpann hone ke bare main nitish ne kaha ki bharat main koi yah nahin kah saktaa ki ham jabardasti satta main bane rahenge
 He said that elections are held regularly in India, so it is not a crisis, but a crisis of trust and trust has arisen and if distrust has arisen in the minds of the people today, remove it and re-create a morale of trust in power
 The occupants have the greatest responsibility and responsibility over them
 nitish ne kaha ki satta main baithe log agar aisa nahin kar pate hai to samay aane par janata apana amogh astr (vot) chalaaegi

 Right now they are engaged in bringing the matter to their logical end, but in the meantime we wished that a permanent appointment should be made with the Public Service Commission but it has not been done because the proposals that come to the government should be related to the Police Department People came
 mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘maine kaha he ki agar police vibhaag se logon ko lenaa he to kuch logon ko liya ja saktaa he lekin uskaa kor strength hona chahie or ve keval usee kaam ke liye niyukt hon

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni is ready to give up the captaincy of the Indian Test team if a better alternative is found
 dhoni ne kaha ki iske liye vikalp ke taur par 'behatar vyakti' kaa chayan hona chahie
 After eight consecutive defeats under his captaincy on foreign soil, pressure has increased on Dhoni to give up the captaincy
 dhoni kii captaini main bhartiya team ko england or australia main chaar-chaar maichon main haar mili he
 Dhoni said on Tuesday that captaincy is a responsibility over which no one has a monopoly
 yah jimmedaari usee ko milani chahie jo us samay team ke netritv ke liye sabase upyukt ho
 Dhoni said, "this is an additional responsibility and role for me
 is sthaan par har koi kabiz nahin ho saktaa
 i got this responsibility three and a half years ago
 main is team ke saath behatar pradarshan kaa prayaas kar rahaa hum
 During this time we have achieved success on several occasions and failed on many occasions
 "tippaniyan "i'm in a position
 main tab tak is pad kii garima banaae rakhane kaa prayaas karuunga, jab tak yah mere paas he
 This is not a post on which i would like to remain forever
 agar behatar vikalp mila to main yah pad chhod duungaa
 This is an open matter
 " "I want the Indian team to perform well
 yah meri captaini main ho yaa phir kisi or kii captaini main, mujhe isse fark nahin padataa
 If there is anyone who can do this job better, i will welcome him
 yah aisa pad nahin, jise aap apni ichha ke mutabik maang sakate hon
 " videshi dharti par apni captaini main mili lagaataar aath haar ke baad dhoni par captaini chhodane kaa dabaav bad gaya he
 Under Dhoni's captaincy, the Indian team has lost four matches each in England and Australia
 dhoni ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki captaini aisi jimmedaari hoti he, jis par kisi kaa ekadhikaar nahin hota
 This responsibility should be given to the one who is most suitable for the leadership of the team at that time
 dhoni ne kaha, "yah mere liye ek atirikt jimmedaari or bhoomika he
 Not everyone can occupy this place
 yah jimmedaari mujhe saade teen saal pehle mili thi
 i am trying to do better with this team
 is dauraan hamane maukon par safalataa hasil kii or kai maukon par naakaam rahe

 jwaala ne apane twit main likhaa ki unhone apane parivaar ke logon ke liye hameshaa se tikat or rahane kaa kharchaa uthaaya he
 i do not know what was promised and what was the demand ??? But do you know the dates of the match before the team leaves? Should your schedule be set ahead of time? Threat of not playing is right ??? Hmmm
 
 my family always paid for tickets n stayed in hotels
 
 
 i have no idea what's being promised n what's the demand ?? But for the games when u know dates long before the team leaves
 
 isn't it better to book n plan in advance? Threatening not play

 However, the matter was later resolved and Saina also tweeted a picture with her father

 'da hindu' main chhapi en ram kii report se to yahi lagata he
 N
 Ram says that 41 per aircraft
 42 pratishat adhik daam dekar kharide ja rahe hai
 After reading this report, it seems that the debate in Parliament on prices is not final
 modi sarkaar kaa tark rahata he ki bharat or france ke bich jo qaraar hua he uski gopneeyata kii sharton ke kaaran keemat nahin bataa sakate
 But that agreement states that the terms of confidentiality are limited to matters related to defense
 yani keemat bataai ja sakati he
 Price is not classified information
 vivaad se pehle jab deal hui thi tab sena or civil adhikariyon ne media ko brif kiya tha or baqayda keemat bataai thi
 n Ram says that when the Dasso Aviation was chosen after a long process in 2007, it was decided that 18 aircraft would come in equipped condition and 108 Hindustan Aeronautics Limited would be built
 us vakt dasson ne ek vimaan ke liye 79
 3 million euros (rs 642 crore) was sought
 2011 main yah keemat 100
 85 million euros (rs
 817 crore)
 beshak 2016 main 2011 kii keemton ke anusaar 9 pratishat kii chhot modi sarkaar ne hasil kar lee magar wo chhot 126 vimaanon ke liye nahin, 36 vimaanon ke liye thi
 The price of an aircraft was fixed at 91
 75 million euro (743 karod rupee)
 This is not the whole story
 kahani kaa bada or doosraa hissaa yah he ki dasson ne kaha ki bharat ke hisaab se vimaan ko susajjit karne ke liye 1
 4 billion euros (11345 crore rupees) more to be paid
 bharat ne molbhav kar ise 1
 3 billion euros (rs 10536 crore)
 bhartiya vaayu sena kii maang thi ki rafaal vimaan ko 13 visheshtaon se las hona chahie taaki bharat kii zaruuraton ke anukool ho
 1 for 36 aircraft for this
 3 billian euro (10536 karod rupee) dene par sahmati hui
 Accordingly, the price per aircraft is 36
 11 million euro (292 karod rupee) 
 It was priced at 11 in 2007
 11 milayan euro (90 karod rupee) 
 There was no change in the characteristics of the Air Force that were demanded during the UPA and Modi government
 'da hindu' ne is saude se sambandhit raksha mantralay ke kai dastauez dekhe hai
 a seven-member Indian Negotiation Team (INT) was formed for the Rafale aircraft deal
 iske teen sadsy keemat se lekar kai baton ko lekar etraz karte hai
 The remaining four members of the team dismiss each of their questions
 har baar 4-3 ke antar se hi faisla hota he
 These three members are Joint Secretary and Acquisition Manager Rajeev Verma, Financial Manager Ajit Sule, Advisor (cast) MP Singh
 inkaa kahana tha ki bharat kii zaruuraton ke hisaab se taiyaar karne ke liye alag se 1
 The amount of Euro 3 billion (rs 10536 crore) is very high
 team ne ise khaarij karte hue likhaa ki bharat ke hisaab se 126 vimaanon ko taiyaar karne ke liye 1
 4 billion euros (rs
 11345 crores) was to be given, much better than 1 for 36 aircraft
 3 billian euro (10536 karod rupee) dena
 What a wonderful account! The Cabinet Committee on Defense Affairs, led by the Prime Minister, approved the team's decision
 INT kii report kii samiksha kanoon mantralay, vitt mantralay or raksha maamalon kii mantrimandaleey samiti karti he
 According to the note given by the government to the Supreme Court and also given to the petitioners, the government note does not mention any role of the Defense Buying Council (DAC) headed by Defense Minister Manohan Parrikar
 yah kaise ho saktaa he jabaki raksha kareed prakriya ke tahat DAC ko hi faisle lene ke adhikaar hai
 Hence, it is not surprising that when Prime Minister Modi announced the deal on his behalf in Paris on 10 April 2015, the Defense Minister was telling himself unknown
 en ram kaa mul sawaal yah he ki bharat sarkaar ke paas rafaal se keemton ko lekar saudebaazi karne ke kai hathiyaar the, unka istamaal kyon nahin kiya gaya
 On 4 July 2014, Eurofighter's top official wrote a letter to Defense Minister Arun Jaitley that he could deliver 126 Eurofighter with better capacity at 20% lower price
 is patr main yah bhi likhaa he ki raksha mantri ne unke desh ke rajdoot se jo guzarish kii uske jawaab main yah peshkash karte hue unhen khushi ho rahi thi
 That is, the Defense Minister himself took the initiative
 jabaki INT cameti ne eurofiter ke prastaav ko yah kah kar thukraa diya ki eurofiter ne bin maange prastaav diya he, is vakt tender band ho chukaa he or niyamon ke anukool is str par is par vichaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Whether or not this decision of the committee was right, there can be a debate but the government could have negotiated it with Rafal
 eurofiter ne to yahaan tak kaha ki vah bharat kii zaruuraton ko dekhte hue germany, england, spain or italy ke order ko roak kar pehle supplai kar degaa
 Three members of the committee have also lodged Eurofighter's proposal that the aircraft is giving 20 percent less price
 upie ke samay jab tender niklaa tha tab vaayu sena ne eurofiter kaa bhi pareekshan kiya tha
 This ship was also found to be unmatched but lagged behind at the time
 rafaal kam keemat kaa prastaav dekar deal ke andar ghusaa or zyaada keemat par jahaaz bechney kii deal kar nikal gaya
 There has been no reporting as of who benefited from this, how much money was received, as happened during the time of Bofors
 jab euro fiter 20 pratishat kam daam par usee kshamta kaa jahaaz de rahaa tha tab 41
 Why was it bought from Rafal at a 42 percent higher price
 eurofiter ne yah bhi kaha tha ki company bharat main eurofiter industrial park banaaegi, training program chalaaegi or saport degi
 In the new deal with Rafal, Hindustan Aeronautics was also excluded, which was to build 108 ships earlier
 en ram kaa kahana he ki dasson company ke saath vyapaarik samjhauta nahin kiya jaataa he
 There is agreement between the two countries but sovereign guarantee is not taken
 phir do mulkon ke bich samjhaute kaa kya matlab rah jaataa he? samprabhu guarantee kaa matlab he ki france sarkaar har baat kii zimmedaari leti
 Not only this, the proposal of the Eurofighter was rejected by the closure of the tender, but what Prime Minister Modi announced in Paris was a completely new deal
 pehle kii prakriyaaon se 126 vimaanon kii baat hui thi, ab 36 kharide ja rahe the
 Obviously, there could be negotiation at that level too
 en ram ne likhaa he ki 2007 main 126 vimaanon ko bharat ke hisaab se taiyaar karne ke liye alag se 1
 4 billion euros (11345 crore rupees) to be paid
 2016 main 36 vimaanon ko taiyaar karne liye 1
 It is decided to pay 3 billion euros (rs 10536 crore)
 ganit main aap fail bhi honge tab bhi is antar ko samaj sakate hai ki khel kahaan hua he
 Due to this every aircraft price increases by 25 million Euros (202 crores rupees)
 france ne beshak saadhaaran vimaan kii keemat par 9 pratishat kii chhot di thi lekin susajjit vimaan kii keem 25 million euro (202 karod rupee) badha di gai
 Not only this, the earlier follow on clauses were removed
 iske tahat 126 vimaanon ke liye jo sharten tay hui thim unheen ke aadhaar or daam par 63 vimaan or khariden ja sakate the
 Why were these classes removed? Why 41 to 36 planes
 42 pratishat adhik daamon par karidaa gaya? The BJP attacked Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and asked why Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah remained silent on the issue of autonomy while in power

 1- Love asks for sympathy, love asks for time, love asks for surrender
 aapako agar samay kharch karnaa pasand nahin he to aapaki garlfriend ban to jaaegi lekin rishta tikega yaa nahin ye kahana mushkil he
 Love involves both of their will, agreements have to be made
 2- insaan ko akelepan se dar lagata he lekin kehete hai ki ek baar use akelaapan acha lag gaya to phir uske kisi kii jarurat bhi mahasoos nahin hoti he
 If you are avoiding interfering in your personal life then it is difficult to become a girlfriend

 And people always run away from people of irritable nature

 Put soil on the past and move forward in life
 5- agar aap kisi prakaar kii hin bhaavana ke shikaar hai to bhi aapaki garlfriend banane kii sambhaavna bahut kam he
 If the boy does not have confidence, the girls start running away
 6- agar aap logon kaa sammaan nahin karte hai unki bhaawanaaon ko halke main lete hai to bos sanbhal jaaie
 Every human has its own importance
 sabko sammaan denge to sambhaavnaaen khulengi

 He feels that humanity has lost its direction, and he decides to destroy it and rebuild it
 vah apane saath chaar mutent saathiyon ko letaa he jinamein meganito bhi hota he
 He wants the company of x Man founder Charles Xavier to capture the brains of all the people of the world

 dilli ke moulana aaazaad medical college main padhane vaali ek chaatra ne seniors par raging kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The post graduate first year student has complained to the Delhi Police
 chaatra kaa kahana he ki uske saath seniors pehle din se hi budtamiji se pesh aate the
 He complained about this from HOD to the college's Anti Ragging Cell
 lekin jab koi karrwai nahin hui to central dilli ke disipi se kar di
 After this, at the behest of the police, the National Anti Wrangling Committee has started investigating the case
 jammu-kashmir main anuchhed 370 hataane ke kendra sarkaar ke faisle par bijepi kii ghor virdohi partiyon ke bhi bill ke samarthan main aane se jediu kii pareshaani bad gai he
 Because he disagreed with the bill while in the NDA
 jabaki bijepi ke sabase bade virdohi dal aam aadmi party, bahujan samaaj party or telugu desham jaisi partiyon ne jammu-kashmir sanshodhan bill kaa samarthan kiya
 However, while in the NDA, JDU has kept its stand apart from BJP since 1996 on the issue of Section 370, triple talaq, Uniform Code of Conduct and Ram Mandir
 lekin tab bijepi ke paas vah takat nahin thi ki apane balboote in samvedansheel maamalon par apni marji chalaa sake
 Now the time has changed
 jediu ne teen talaak ke mudde par voting kaa bahishkaar kar apni laaj to bachaa lee lekin anuchhed 370 ke maamle main kai virdohi partiyon ke samarthan main aane se vah pareshaan he
 Moreover, now the party leadership is definitely in the thinking due to the demand to reconsider the stand from inside the party too
 kya kehete hai kasee tyagijediu ke rashtriya mahasachiv ke
 C
 tyaagi ne bill par asahmati jataate hue kaha ki is samay tak hamaara stand yahi he, aage kya hoga wo party ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar tay karenge
 Nitish Kumar's government in Bihar is running with the support of the BJP, while the JDU at the center is in support of the Narendra Modi government, even if they do not support it, the central government will not mind
 lekin bihar main pad saktaa he
 However, BJP will not withdraw support from Nitish Kumar government
 vah samarthan waapas lekar ek jatke main kaam khatm nahin karnaa chaahegi
 But this much is certain that it can have an impact in the 2020 assembly elections
 bijepi bhi jaanati he ki nitish kumaar kaa apana stand he, use wo badal nahin sakate hai
 Many times JDU has been indirectly benefiting BJP by boycotting voting
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki bhale hi janata dal you apane puraane stand ko kaayam rakhan ke liye tarah-tarah kii jugat karti rahi ho lekin ant main isse bijepi ko phayda hi phayda mil rahaa he
 On one hand, the opposing parties supporting him have joined him, on the other hand parties like NDA, Shiv Sena and JDU are under pressure
 bihar vidhansabha chunaav par kya padegaa asar?is saal maharashtra main chunaav he or agle saal bihar main, jaahir he aise muddon kaa laabh uthaakar bijepi in sahyogi dalon par apana dabadabaa kaayam karne main kaamyaab bhi ho sakati he
 In such a situation, the talk of reconsidering the stand has also started from inside JDU
 party ke netaa or purv pravaktaa ajay alok ne twit kar party ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar se dhara 370 ke stand par punarvichaar karne kii apil kii he to ek or vidhayak amarnath gami ne tanj kasate hue fasebuk par likhaa he ki khud kshetreey dal hai, ek do rajya main prabhaav dikhataa he phir bhi alpsankhyak tushtikaran ke kaaran dhara 370 hataane kaa virodh karte hai
 Deserve thanks

 After the breakup in this film, Salman will once again be seen romancing Katrina Kaif
 salmaan ne ghataya 17 kilo vajan, ab pahchaan main nahin aa rahetiger film ko darshakon ne khub pasand kiya tha ab dekhnaa he ki kya is baar bhi salmaan apane ection avatar main kamaal dikhaa paaenge
 It is a history of Salman's films that action films have always been the first choice of the audience, rather than the other drama films of this actor
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki tubalite main ek bhole bhaale shaks ke kirdaar main darshakon ko rijhaane main naakaamayaab rahe salmaan ne ek baar phir ection avatar main lautne kaa faisla kiya he
 In Tiger Zinda Hai, Salman will be seen doing what action in the action image, it will be revealed in the film trailer itself

 5 lakh swasthya centre khole jaaenge
 The benefit of opening these health centers will be immediate to the common people, as they will not have to go far for treatment of common diseases and will be able to get treatment from these centers nearby
 saath hi aarogy se judi suvidhaayen bhi muhaiyaa karai jaaengi
 The benefit of initial treatment will be given to the common people
 Insurance of Rs 5 lakh will be given when the patient is admitted to the hospital in case of major or serious illness, but the health centers will get immediate benefit to all types of sick people, big and small
 ab tak desh main ek swasthya centre se duusare swasthya centre ke bich kaaphi duuri hoti thi, lekin dedh lakh nae swasthya kendron ke aa jane kii surat main biimaar logon ke liye ghar ke kareeb hi ilaaj karana sulabh ho jayega

 philhal desh main nijee or sarkari donon medical collejon se har saal 67 hajaar embibies or 31 hajaar post graduate doctor paas hokar nikalate hai
 In such a situation, with the opening of many new medical colleges, the shortage of doctors will be removed and enough doctors will be able to treat people

 Himmat Patidar, who is associated with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in Ratlam, is accused of killing a man named Madan Malviya
 When Aaj Tak's team reached that commuted village in Ratlam district, many shocking things related to this murder have come to light
 sabase zyada chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki is hatya kii sajeesh himmat ne kaaphi pehle kar lee thi jiske liye use shikaar kii talash thi
 Madan Malaviya was not the target of courage from the beginning but he was killed due to a sudden incident
 darasal, madan malviya par kuch din pehle tak aresas se jude himmat patidaar kii hatya kaa aarope tha, lekin jab ratlam police ne maamle par se pardaa uthaaya to puraa maamla hi ulat gaya kyonki jis madan malviya par himmmat patidaar kii hatya kaa aarope tha wo khud hi mritak niklaa or jis himmat patidaar kii hatya se madhyapradesh main raajnneetik tufaan khadaa ho gaya tha wo khud puri sajeesh kaa rachayita or hatyara niklaa
 Madan, who was being questioned by the police as a killer, is now mourning after the case was revealed
 madan ke mata-pita, patni kaa ro-rokar bura haal he
 Ironically, Madan's wife can neither speak nor hear, but she realizes that her husband is no longer in this world
 ab pita madan kii do choti choti betiyon kaa hawala dekar apane bete ke hatyare ke liye faansee kii sajaa kii maang kar rahe hai
 The murder script was already set
 After this very sensitive murder case was exposed, gradually several layers of the case were being opened
 ajtak kii team jab camed gaanv main gai or logon se baat kii to pataa chalaa ki himmat patidaar ne hatya kii kahani or script pehle se hi tay kar lee thi
 In Kamed village, we found a person named Ram Gopal who narrowly escaped being a victim of Himmat Patidar's conspiracy
 ramgopal kii maane to aaropee himmat ne ghatana vaali raat kareeb dedh baje ramgopal ko phone kar khet par bulaayaa tha lekin thand ke kaaran usne bahaanaa banaakar manaa kar diya or shaayad isi bahaane ne uski jindagi batch gai
 Ram Gopal said that Himmat Patidar had made a call on the night of the incident and tried to invite him to the party on the farm but refused to go there due to the night being over
 police ne kiya ghatana kaa ricriationaham gaanv main logon se baat kar hi rahe the ki hamen police ke ghatnasthal par jane kii soochna mili
 When we reached there, it was found that SP Gaurav Tiwari of the district is recreating the incident with the local police station and FSL team
 ye isliye bhi zaruri he kyonki ab police iske jariye himmat patidaar ke khilaaf pukhta saboot jutaney main lag gai he
 The SP said that in this massacre, the nails and hair samples of the deceased changed the course of the investigation and the person who had made the case for murder has now been made the accused of murder
 espi gaurav tiwari ne bataaya ki shuruaati taur par police ko shaq ho gaya tha ki shav kii pahchaan chhipaane kii koshish sajeesh kii ore ishaara kar rahaa he or isliye ennesail team ne shav ke nakhun or baalo kaa sample le liye the
 Initially, the body was revealed to be of the courageous Patidar and at that time the circumstances were such that everyone was mourning after which his family cremated, but on the basis of evidence found on the occasion and the SFL team Initially, the investigation revealed that Madan is a murderer in it
 jab mritak ke paas mili phone ko check kiya to paaya ki use format kiya gaya tha or usamen se sab data gaayab tha jabaki himmat patidaar ke phone kii detail nikaali gai to pataa chalaa ki wo raat ko kaaphi der net kaa istemaal kar rahaa tha
 Apart from this, he had courage in the field, but neither did he turn on the motor nor put water in the field
 iske alaava shav par jo kapade the wo bhi aise lag the the ki kisi ne jaldbaazi main unhen pahanaaya ho
 Apart from this, only the face of the dead body was burnt indicating that an attempt has been made to hide the identity
 nakhun or baalo se hua khulhasaahamaari ennesail team ne samajhadaari kaa parichay dete hue pehle hi shav ke nakhun, baalo or bone maro kaa sample prizerv kar liya tha or use sagar bhej diya jiske baad vahaan se report aane par pataa chalaa ki shav madan malviya kaa he
 Apart from this, investigation revealed that Himmat Patidar had insured 20 lakhs last December itself and also deposited his installment of 1000 rupees and after that some people also gave a statement that on the night of the incident, they took Himmat to the farm Had seen that he had not been on the field for about 1 week and when all the necessary evidence was matched, it became clear that the murderer is a Patidar
 aaropee himmat patidaar par 10 hazaar rupee kaa inaam bhi ghoshit kiya he
 Police reached the house of the accused, while Himmat Patidar has committed the murder, the next day after the revelation, the police again reached the accused's house and questioned the family members
 camed gaanv himmat patidaar kaa kilanuma makaan main vah apane bhaaiyon ke saath rahata he
 At the moment, Himmat is absconding
 police ne maamle main essiasti act ke tahat bhi dhara lagaai he or saath hi main saazish kii dhara bhi lagaai he kyonki jis tarah se is hatyakand ko anjaam diya gaya usase aisa lagata he ki vah kaaphi vakt se is hatyakand kii sajeesh rach rahaa tha
 At the same time, the BJP is also on the backfoot after the case was revealed because after the murder, former CM Shivraj accused the Congress of political killings and also warned of agitation
