 For the first time after becoming a grandfather, Amitabh Bachchan met the media with his son Abhishek
 amitabh ne media ke sanyam ke liye unhen dhanyavad diya or patrakaron ke puche sawaalon par khulkar jawaab bhi diya
 For the past several days, there were many headlines in the media about the news of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's daughter
 alam ye tha ki amitabh bachchan ko baar baar media se ye guzarish kerani padi thi ki aishwarya kii bacchee kaa hona unke parivaar kaa nihaayat nijee maamla he isliye media is sambandh main koi bhi khabar na prachaarit karen
 Replying to a question, Amitabh Bachchan said that Aishwarya Bachchan gave birth to the child naturally on 16 November under normal procedure and not through operation
 bachchan ne yah bhi kaha he ki internet par aishwarya kii unki bacchee ke saath kai tasviren jari kii gai hai, lekin ve sabhi farji hai
 On this occasion, Abhishek Bachchan said that it is a great pleasure for our family
 abhishek ne aage bataaya ki jis samay aishwarya kii delivery hone vaali thi us vakt unke saath parivaar ke saare sadsy maujuud thea
 At the same time, when Amitabh was asked the question whether he had named his granddaughter, Amitabh did not have the answer
 amitabh ne kaha ki abhi hamane bacchee ke naam ke bare main kuch nahin sochaa he lekin aaj raat ek saath puraa parivaar baithkar is bare main faisla kar legaa
 Amitabh said that there is no special day for christening and the celebrations will be celebrated on the same day when the whole family will agree
 isse pehle pita banane ke baad pehali baar abhishek bachchan ne twitor ke jariye apane prashansakon se kaha ki bachchan parivaar kii nai sadsy ne mangalvaar ko apane dada amitabh bachchan ke ghar main pravesh kiya
 Abhishek was eager to bring his wife Ashwarya and Baby b home
 unhone tivat kiya ki donon hi thik hai or unki beti bahut khubasurat he
 Amitabh has also written in his blog that his granddaughter looks like her mother Ash
 kaha ja rahaa he ki christmis ke avasar par baby bi kaa namakaran pratiksha main kiya jayega
 At present, all the family members are thinking of the name of the child
 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ke kathith lahar ko lekar bhale hi party or anya dalon ke netaa aamane-saamne hon, parantu modi ke isi lahar kii agnipariksha bihar ke mithilanchal or simanchal main honi he
 By the way, in some seats of Kosi region, BJP candidates have to undergo tough examination
 bihar main hone vaale chah main se teen charnon kaa matdaan sampann ho chukaa he jabaki chauthe charan kaa matdaan 30 april ko hona he
 The seven parliamentary constituencies where elections are to be held in the fourth phase include Madhubani, Jhanjharpur, Madhepura, Darbhanga, Samastipur, Begusarai and Khagaria
 madhubani or darbhanga par jahaan bhaajapa ke pratyaashee vijayi hue the, vahiin shesh sabhi paanch siton par jediu ke pratyaashee ne kabja jamaaya tha, lekin is chunaav main paristhitiyaan badali hai
 While JDU is alone in the election field, the Sumar Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), one of the main political parties in Bihar, is perfecting its social engineering and using the 'hands' of the Congress to put it in the fray
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki chauthe charan main hone vaale saat sansadeey kshetron main modi ke lahar kii agnipariksha hogi
 These Muslim majority parliamentary constituencies not only have a significant number of Muslim voters but also the number of Yadav voters can affect any election result
 raajnneeti vishleshak or patrkaar santosh singh kehete hai ki rajya main muslim aabaadi 17 pratishat he or yahaan ke simanchal, mithilanchal tathaa kosi kshetra ke 13 loksabhaa kshetra aise hai jahaan musalamaanon kii aabaadi 18 se 44 pratishat ke bich he
 He says that there is a triangular fight in most of the seats in the state but the number of Muslim voters is in a position to influence the results
 santosh kehete hai ki abhi tak hue teen charnon ke matdaan par gaur karen to muslim bahul kshetron ke matdaan kendron par baari matdaan ho rahaa he, aise main yah dekhne vaali baat hogi ki aakhir muslim matadaata kis party ko vot de rahe hai
 By the way, political experts also say that while the RJD is getting the support of M-Y (muslim-yadav) in this election, the BJP is supporting the effect of the Modi wave
 is charan main darbhanga or madhubani sansadeey kshetra main brahman matadaataaon kii sankhya bhi acchhee khaasi he
 In such a situation, polarization of Brahmin voters will also affect the election result
 jaise-jaise chunaav kii tithi najadik aa rahi he vaise-vaise sabhi dalon ne chunaav prachaar ko tej kar diya he
 Modi has also addressed camps in Madhubani, Saharsa and Darbhanga while Madhepura (JD (U) national president Sharad Yadav is contesting from Madhepura) has become a seat of prestige for Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 
 idhar, argedy ke lalu prasad bhi pratidin chunavi sabha dwaara matadaataaon ko rijhaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai

 Moreover, on Sunday, Gadkari said, "I have no ambition to become the Prime Ministerial candidate nor does the RSS have any intention of presenting me as a candidate
" hamaare liye desh sarvopari he
 Nitin Gadkari's statement comes at a time when there is speculation about the Bharatiya Janata Party presenting him as the Prime Ministerial candidate in the event that no party gets a clear majority in the Lok Sabha elections
 gadakari ne kaha, 'main daud main nahin hum or jor dekar kahata hum ki meraa mantra sirf athak kaam karnaa he
 Gadkari said, 'I have never done any accounting of politics and work
 na hi kabhi koi lakshya tay nahin kiya
 i went, whither way

 i believe in doing the best work for my country
 ’unhone kaha, ‘main na sapane dekhtaa hum or na hi kisi ke paas jaataa hum or na hi lobing karata hum
 Gadkari said that he and his party stand firmly with PM Modi

 Baba Baldas, the religious leader of the Satnami society, which led BJP to power for the third time in Chhattisgarh, has now joined the Congress
 khaas baat yah he ki ye donon congress adhyaksharahul gandhike saath chunavi prachaar par niklenge
 Let us know that on November 9, Rahul Gandhi is coming to Chhattisgarh on a two-day stay
 ve pehle daur kii 18 vidhansabha siton main se lagbhag ek darjan siton par party kaa prachaar karenge or chunavi sabhaayen karenge
 The Congress President's visit includes more than half a dozen such seats, where the large vote bank of the Satnami community holds an important place for any political party
 chhattisgarh main congress ne chauthi baar bijepi ke satta main kabiz hone ke daawey ko nestnabut karne ke liye is turup ke pattey ke taur par istemaal karne kii ranneeti par kaam shuru kar diya he
 Baba Baldas and Baba Khushwant Sahai were warmly welcomed at the Congress Party headquarters
 iske saath hi party ne donon ko un ilaako main chunavi prachaar kii kaman saunpi he, jahaan anusuchit jaati varg kaa satnami samudaay kaa bada varg rahata he
 Along with Baba Baldas and Baba Khushwant Sahai, Rahul Gandhi will try to change the voters' hearts in the areas where BJP was expected to get a lot of votes
 gauratlab he ki pichley vidhansabha chunaav main yahi baba baldas the, jinhone satnam sena kaa gathan kar bijepi ko satta tak pahunchaa diya tha
 At the same time, for the first time in the elections, the Satnam Sena badly cut the vote bank of Congress
 is baar baba ji khud congress ke darbar main chale aaen hai
 Due to this, the aspirations of the BJP are seen turning
 haalanki, party kaa daawa he ki is baar baba baldas kaa wo rang nahin he, jaisaa pichhali baar unhone jamaaya tha
 Hence, the party is not going to mind if he goes to Congress
 congress main shaamil hone par baba kii safaiudhar baba baldas ne satnami samudaay ko congress main shaamil hone par apane anuyaayiyon ko safai di he
 He has said that in the last assembly election, he had supported the BJP because the social and economic progress of the Satnami community would happen, but the BJP did not stand in their eyes
 baba baldas kii satnam sena aaj bhi unke saath he
 However, instead of contesting elections this time, the soldiers of Satnam Army are busy campaigning from house to house
 pichley chunaav main satnam sena ne 21 ummidavaar utaare thepichley vidhansabha chunaav main satnam sena ne 21 ummidavaar chunavi maidan main utaare the
 All the candidates had garnered an average of 6 to 10 thousand votes
 isse congress ko jabardast nuksaan hua or party ke darjan bhar se zyada ummidavaar apni seat ganvaa baithe the
 Baba Baldas is being considered as the trump card of the Congress in the political corridors all over the BJP candidate in Pashopesh
 un samikarnon kaa aankalan kiya ja rahaa he, jahaan ab bijepi ko baari nuksaan jhelana padegaa
 Whatever the BJP may claim after Baba joins Congress, but all its candidates are in the loop
 kabhi congress kaa vot bank tha ye samudaayachhattisgarh main kul 1 karod 85 lakh 59 hajaar matadaataaon main se 24 lakh 12 hajaar se adhik matadaata anusuchit jaati ke hai

 This time too, both BJP President Amit Shah and Congress President Rahul Gandhi had prayed in Baba Baladas's Dham Girodhpuri, but this time not only Baba's blessings, but he himself came into the Congress camp

 aapako bataa den ki modi sarkaar main number 2 kii res main rajnath singh or vitt mantri arun jetali kaa naam he
 However, no official announcement has been made about this
 26 may ko hue shapath grahan samaaroh ko yaad karen to piem modi ke baad varishthata ke aadhaar par rajnath singh ne pad kii gopneeyata kii shapath lee thi
 This was followed by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and then Arun Jaitley
 mjedaar baat yah he ki manmohan singh sarkaar ke dauraan bhi number 2 kii pojishan ko lekar kai baar bahes chhidi thi
 During that time, no instructions were ever issued regarding the acting PM
 upie sarkaar ke dauraan ek artiai ke jawaab main cabinet sachivalay ne kaha tha ki manmohan singh kii anupasthiti main cabinet kamity on political afares ko rashtriya apatkaal se jude maamle main faisle lene kaa adhikaar he
 The post was held by Pranab Mukherjee, later AK Antony assumed the responsibility
 agar modi kii anupasthiti main sisipie kii baithak hoti he to rajnath singh meeting kii adhyakshata kar sakate hai
 His chances of being No
 2 are further strengthened by the fact that in the Lok Sabha he sits on the seat next to Modi

 Dayaram Chaudhary said that the MP has demonstrated energy by running a shoe
 saansad ne apni takat dikhaai
 However, later the MLA refused to beat the party MLA with shoes
 kaha ki aisa kuch nahin he, jo bataaya ja rahaa he
 The mla's beating is a conspiracy of the opponents
 unhone kaha ki ham sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko dikhaanaa chaahate the ki hamaare paas urja kii tanik bhi kami nahin he
 There is no such thing in the case of beating the MLA of party MP Sharad Tripathi
 
 
 bas urja kaa pradarshan hua he
 No one was hit by a shoe and nothing happened
 soshal media par viral video main BJP saansad sharad treepathi (sharad Tripathi) baar-baar kehete hue sune ja sakate hai ki saansad koun he
 After a round of question and answer, MP Sharad Tripathi lost his temper and beat the BJP MLA Rakesh Singh by removing his shoe

 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke liye matdaan se pehle manishankar ayyar ke neech vaale bayaan ke baad congress haikaman ne apane netaaon ke liye sakht nirdesh jari kiye hai
 The Congress has denied all its leaders to react to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his speech
 party ne kaha he ki agar kisi congressi netaa ne piem modi or unke bhaashan par bayaanbaji kii, to uske khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 Rahul Gandhi has issued advisory in this regard as future president of Congress
 isse pehle rahul gandhi ne bataur party upaadhyaksh bhi aisa nirdesh diya tha
 Despite this, Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar created problems for the party by calling PM Modi a lowly man
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle ayyar ke apshabd ne bijepi ko baithe-baithaae hamalaa karne kaa hathiyaar de diya he
 Now the bjp's entire electoral strategy has become focused on the disrespect of Congress leaders
 piem modi bhi is masale par congress ko bakhshane ke mood main nahin he
 Therefore, in their election rallies, they are raising the bad attitude of Congress leaders in public
 shuukravaar ko ahmedabad ke nichol main apni chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi ne chun-chunakar congress netaaon ko nishaanaa banaaya
 He also wrapped up Congress President Sonia Gandhi and his family
 modi ne kaha ki yah pehali baar nahin he, jab congress ke netaaon ne mujhe neech kaha he
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her family have also used such profane language against me
 chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem ne kaha, ''congress ke netaaon ne mujhe kabhi chywala, neech, pagal kutta, bhasmasur, ravan, naalee kaa keedaa, saanp-bichchhu or na jane kya-kya kaha, lekin main chupchaap sahataa rahaa, kyonki meri praathamikta kaam karne kii he
 Targeting the Congress, he said, "during the Lok Sabha elections, Congress leader Imran Masood had said that i will tear Modi into pieces
" usko congress ne loksabhaa chunaav main tikat bhi diya tha
 Congress leader Renka Choudhary called me a virus
 choudhary ne kaha ki main namonitis laata hum
 "modi said," Congress leader Jairam Ramesh compared me to Bhasmasur
 congress netaa benny prasad verma ne mujhe pagal kutta kaha
 Verma also said that we will not let this mad dog win the election
 iske alaava congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne mujhe gangu taili kaha
 "he said," Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh called my government even the demon king and me even to Ravana
 upi congress ke pramukh pramod tiwari ne mujhe hitler, musolini or gaddaphi tak kaha
 The Congress abused me day and night, but i remained at peace
 isaki vajah yah he ki meri praathamikta kaam karnaa he
 At the same time, the Congress has been on the backfoot since the attacks of BJP and PM Modi
 congress upaadhyaksharahul gandhi ne apane netaaon se modi ke bhaashan par pratikriya nahin dene ko kaha he
 However, now it will be known on December 18 that how much BJP and PM Modi can redeem the abuses of Congress leaders in Gujarat elections
 maaloom ho ki gujarat main 9 disambar or 14 disambar ko matdaan hone hai
 After this, the results will come on 18 December
 gujarat main bole rahul- sardaar patel na modi ke na meregujarat ke anand main chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha, ''sardaar patel ji na narendra modi ji ke hai, na rahul gandhi ke hai, na solanki ji ke hai or main sach boluun, to na gujarat ke hai, na hindustan ke hai, balki puri duniya ke hai
 He said that Sardar Patel is not such a small thing that anyone can be
 wo bahut badi cheez hai
 There is a voice inside the heart of Gujarat, which he recognized and for which he fought
 isse badi cheez ho hi nahin sakati
 Rahul Gandhi said that you said that his (sardar Patel) work place is here and he should be respected
 congress unka aadar karegi
 But sometimes it seems that be it Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi or Subhash Chandra Bose, these people have remained a product
 is dauraan rahul gandhi ne chunaav main jeet ko lekar bhi ummid jataai

 mamata banerjee ke saath chhodane kii ghoshnaa ke bich raajnneetik sankat kaa saamana kar rahi congress ke raajnneetik prabandhakon ne mayawati or mulaayam se sampark sadhana shuru kar diya he
 Ramesh Dixit, a political analyst and professor of political science at Lucknow University, told IANS: "in the current political situations, it will be difficult for Mayawati and Mulayam to have laddha in both hands
" agar mulaayam sarkaar bachaate hai, to 2014 main centre main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane or pradhanmantri banane kaa unka sapana chakanachur ho saktaa he
 Mayawati is currently in a state of confusion, and it may be harmful for her to help the Congress

 There was a lot of upheaval on the day of the Karnataka election results
 subah jahaan bijepi kursi par kabiz hote dikh rahi thi, vahiin dopaher hote-hote congress-jedies bhi qatari main lag gayi
 By evening, the ball has come out of the political camp to the Governor's court
 ghante dar ghante badalane vaale is ghatnakram kii shuruyaat main aankade bijepi kii ore jhuke najar aae or vah rajya kii sabase badi party banakar bhi ubhari, baavjood iske bahumat ke aankade se pichad gai
 On the other hand, the ruling Congress suffered significant losses in terms of seats and became the second largest party
 shaam hote-hote congress ne bina shart ke jedies ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kar diya or donon dalon ne rajyapal se milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa bhi pesh kar diya he
 BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa had already claimed to meet the Governor and form the government
 to jaan lete hai aaj karnataka ke kase hue nateezon main dinabhar hua kya tha
 The moment when the counting of votes started, both the big parties were following the BJP and Congress trends
 kabhi congress baaji maar leti to kabhi bijepi kii siten badhati dikhti
 JDS continued to lead the trends, staying at number three from the beginning
 bijepi kii badhat dhire-dhire zyada hoti gai or tay hone laga ki vah beete chunaav se behatar pradarshan karne ja rahi he
 The graph of the Congress was falling and the JDS held the third position
 dopaher tak bijepi 100 siton kaa aankada paar kar chuki thi or yahaan se 112 ke jaadui aankade ko choona kaaphi aasaan dikh rahaa tha
 The Congress was clearly seeing a loss of 50 to 60 seats at this time
 jeet se pehle BJP kaa jashnatasvir saaf hoti usase pehle hi bijepi netaaon ke jashn kii tasviren aani shuru ho chuki thim
 Party leaders also started congratulating each other, as the BJP was seen getting more than 120 seats in the trends
 congress kii haar tay maani ja rahi thi or uskaa mukbala ab tisare number kii party jedies se tha
 The real picture was clear after noon when the trends started turning into results
 nateezon se saaf ho gaya ki koi bhi dal bahumat kaa aankada nahin chhu paa rahaa he orgedies kingmekarki bhoomika main ubhar rahi he
 When there was a festive atmosphere in the BJP, which had been assured of victory, the Congress was engaged in the exercise of forming a high command government
 ekaek congress kii ore se jedies ko bina shart ke samarthan kaa elaan kiya gaya or jedies netaa kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri banane par bhi sahamati bani
 No one got the majority Even as the BJP was reduced to 104 seats, it still needed 8 seats for majority
 saath hi congress ke khate main 78 siten ain to jedies kii jholii main bhi nirnaayak 38 siten thi
 In such a situation, it was difficult for the BJP to form a single government and the congress-jds total 116 seats were getting beyond the majority
 donon hi dalon main sarkaar banane ko lekar manthan shuru ho chukaa tha
 The distance between Delhi and Bangalore was also decreasing
 congress kii ore se varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad or ashok gahalot subah hi bengalooru pahunch chuke the or bijepi kii ore se kendriya mantri anant kumaar pehle se vahaan maujuud the
 Both parties sought an appointment with the governor, but then the governor was asked to wait until the final results
 is bich shaam ko bengalooru ke ek hotel main jedies pramukh echdi devgauda ke saath congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad samet donon party ke netaaon ne baithak bhi kii he
 After the picture was cleared, Siddaramaiah of the Congress resigned as the first Chief Minister
 iske baad bijepi ke yediurppa ne sabase badi party hone ke naate rajyapal se milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya
 Immediately after this, Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah also put forward the claim of the coalition to form the government on the basis of the seats won
 rajyapal ke paale main gendrajyapal vajubhai vaala kii ore se philhal koi sanket nahin die gaye hai lekin mana ja rahaa he ki sabase badi party hone ke naate vah bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa denge
 However, if the congress-jds is invited to form the government on the basis of post-election alliance in Manipur and Goa, then both these parties will have no problem in forming the government
 is bich bijepi kii ore se siem ummidavaar bies yediurppa ne daawa ki he ki unhen rajyapal kii ore se bahumat sabit karne ke liye 48 ghanton kaa vakt diya gaya he
 It is also learned from the sources that 5-6 JDS mlas are in touch with BJP
 bahumat ke aankade se dur bijepi sankhyabal jutaney ke liye vidhayakon ko apane paale main lene kii koshish bhi kar rahi he
 It is also known that Congress can send its mlas out of Parabengaluru on the lines of Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections
 karnataka main philhal sarkaar ke gathan ko lekar tasviir saaf nahin hui he
 Depending on the instructions of the Governor and the efforts of the BJP, whose government will be formed in the state
 is bich congress or jedies ke paas sirf intjaar karne kaa vikalp hi bachaa he
 Take the needles of time as much as you can
 lekin jad se bhartiya hone kii vajah se ham logon kii kuch aadaten aaj bhi jas kii tas hai
 Some of these habits hurt many times, and sometimes bring laughter in the face
 dilachasp ye he ki ye aadaten hamaari socity main set ho gai hai
 There is a dire need to change some of these habits, while some have the happiness to remain the same
 aage jaaniye ham bharatiyon kii aisi hi 10 baaten
 1
 sadak par mutana:deevaaron par hameshaa likhaa dekha he ki dekho gadhaa peshaab kar rahaa he
 But near that wall there is always moisture of human 'water'
 kabhi us diwaar ke paas kisi ne gadhe ko peshaab karte nahin dekha hoga
 That is, in our cities and towns, as if there is a custom that when it is seen, do not look at the place, just do it
 lakh svachh bharat abhiyaan ke binar lage hon
 2
 beti kii shaadi main pita kii jhuki najar, jude haath:beti paraayaa dhan hoti he
 As long as this mindset remains in the mind, even after spending lakhs of rupees in wedding marriages, the father of the daughter stands with folded hands
 na jane ye dhakiyanusi sabhyataa kaa koun sa rivaaj he, jisamen beti ke pita ko shaadi byaahon main najar jhukaae hi dekha gaya he
 But in countries other than India, the father of the daughter looks more decorated and shining than the groom
 3
 Rotale serial and mother and sister cravings: Because mother-in-law was also daughter-in-law, but the real question is that even when mother-in-law was daughter-in-law, she was able to watch so many serials, as mother, sister-in-law, wife and sisters are watching in our homes today
 Huh
 bharat main serials ke liye jitani deewangi he, utani kahin bhi nahin dekhne ko milti he
 4
 maanav kaa nagin main badalanaa:yaad kiijie us aakhri baraat ko, jisamen aap gaye the
 You must have met at least one person, who you would have seen openly taking the serpent form in the middle of the band's voice
 yani nagin tone par jameen par lotate hue
 Say anything, in any marriage, if a serpent is not seen, then he does not have to be attentive in the fun of marriage
 5
 How should our leader: Take any election from independent India till now and see it
 har baar netaa adhadhundh vaade karte hai
 Parachute candidates are fielded
 hamaare ilaake main kaam karnaa hota he vidhayak, saansad ko
 But we choose the leader who is the face of one of our party

 shaadi se pehle ladki kaa 'furniture' ban janaa:shaadi ke liye ladki dekhne kii parampara aaj bhi bharat main lagbhag waisi hi he, jaise pehle kabhi hua karti thi
 However, the attitude of the people has changed a lot
 lekin phir bhi bete kii shaadi ke liye ladke ke gharavaale ladki ko aise dekhte hai, jaise kisi furniture ko kharidte vakt dekha jaataa he

 Cricket - Have not seen such madness: Admittedly, there is Sachin Tendulkar in our country, but this does not mean that every other launda or madam is seen showing madness for cricket
 vau, kohli rox tip
 Cricket is also played in other countries of the world but love of 'katha, Havan Karao' type is seen only in India

 MRP means to fight for money: the speed at which Indians show quickness in uprooting MRP when buying or selling
 us teji se to kabhi bhi bullate train main nahin chal sakati

 Mangalyaan is a fresh and national example of this
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne dilli main booth kaaryakartaaon se kaha he ki hamaara kaam he chunaav jeetne kaa ek aisa system banane kaa, jisase agle 25 saal tak sirf bijepi hi jite
 This mechanism will be used in Delhi elections
 agar ham yahaan safal rahen, to yahi tarika bihar main bhi apanaayenge
 After all, what will be the system that the BJP president is going to use in the Delhi elections, and if successful, he will continue to win elections for the next 25 years
 in bayanon se yah spasht he ki bijepi ke liye dilli kaa chunaav sabase mahatvapurn he
 She does not want to lose this election, but has come down to win at all costs
 is aatmavishvaas kaa ek namoona to is baat main he ki chunaav ke teen hafte pehle party baahar se apane liye ek cheharaa laati he or virodhiyon ko chaunkaa detii he
 It would not have been done just by relying on air
 congress or aam aadmi party ne apane ummidavaar tak ghoshit kar die hai, lekin yah lekh likhe jane tak bijepi ke ummidavaaron kaa pataa bhi nahin
 However, the BJP has claimed on one face only that it is going to do an experiment in Delhi, which if successful, no one will be able to beat it for 25 years
 19 janvari yani somvaar ke din bijepi sansadeey board kii baithak honi he, jisamen tikat kaa elaan hone kii sambhaavna he
 The role of the organization in the politics of the last twenty years has weakened in every party
 aaj kii bhaajapa se pehle ek hi party thi, jisane sanghathan ko praathamikta di or vah thi bahujan samaaj party
 This made booth management the strongest base of the organization
 booth se lekar zila str ke cordinator banaae gaye, jinaki puch party main vidhayak or saansad se bhi zyada hoti thi
 But after getting an absolute majority in Uttar Pradesh in 2007, this strong fort of Mayawati started to weaken and now it is shattered, which Mayawati is trying to revive
 basapa ke booth manjament kaa zikr isliye kiya, kyonki isi kii tarj par congress ne bhi apane yahaan cordinator system lagu kiya, magar zyada kaamyaab nahin hua
 The BSP put the bag in charge for each booth
 baste main har booth ke matadaata kii ek ek jaankaree rakhi gai
 a similar page has been made in charge in BJP
 jab tak basapa kaa yah garh majboot tha, tab tak use dhahaana mushkil hota tha, lekin bijepi is maamle main basapa se behatar ho gai he
 That is why after taking over the Delhi elections, the national president addressed the booth workers and filled them with enthusiasm
 lekin kya sirf booth management hi satta paane kaa vah achook mantra he, jiske sahare bijepi kabhi haaregi hi nahin
 Amit Shah also mentioned the success of his government's programs, but he knows that elections on the ground are not won by mere propaganda and propaganda
 use jeet main badalane ke liye booth varkar chahie
 That is why he is telling the booth worker how to walk by uncle salute, Tai greet
 to kya bijepi ko zamin par aam aadmi party ne takkar de di he
 Why is BJP putting so much at stake to defeat the two-year-old party? Winning the election is the right and main task of every party, but for a state whose demand for perfection keeps on happening, why is BJP playing such a big bet? rashtriya adhyaksh, pradhanmantri or duusari jagah se laai gayi kiran bedi, yah sab dekhakar koi kah saktaa he ki bijepi ghabara gai he
 But what did the BJP do after giving up
 congress kii tarah ghar nahin baithi rahi, balki kiran bedi ko laakar ek or daanv khel diya
 Now in BJP, he can also become CM, which will not belong to RSS
 jo siem banane ke hafte bhar pehle bijepi kaa bhi nahin hoga
 However this is a double risk
 haarane par haar kii maar dohari ho sakati he, lekin bijepi ne risk liya
 Perhaps the same quality is making BJP a winning team in today's politics
 sawaal purna bahumat yaa bahumat se dur rah jane kaa nahin, sawaal he jeetne ke us lakshya ko hasil karte rahane ke junun kaa he, jise har party main hona hi chahie
 Probably to the extent of arrogance
 kisi ko yah baat ahamkaari lag sakati he ki aisi koun si maikenism bana lenge ki 25 saal tak koi haraa hi nahin paaegaa
 History knows that the Samajwadi Party defeated the BSP with booth management easily in its game and Akhilesh came with an absolute majority
 sapa ne basapa se rigerv siten bhi chhin leen
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see which opposition party first accepts this challenge of BJP
 kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne bhi kaha he ki bijepi dilli main landmark tareeke se jeetegi
 By 2019, 20 of India's 29 states will win
 pataa nahin 9 rajya kiske liye prakaash ji ne chhod die hai or ve koun se 9 rajya hai
 What does Amit Shah immediately declare that we will win 29 of 29 states
 yah aatm vishwaas he yaa vishwaas kaa ati vishwaas is par kai tarah se kaaphi kuch kaha ja saktaa he, lekin satta main aakar bhi party ko daudaaye rakhane kaa chalan nayaa-nayaa sa lagata he
 Amit Shah has transformed the party into a winning machinery
 is mashin main koi bhi jitaane vaala aa saktaa he
 Today, more than a hundred former Congressmen are said to be among the winning mps of BJP
 shazia ilmi, binni ko bhi party ek ghatana kii tarah shaamil karaati he
 This has happened in politics even before, but in the BJP, it has not happened under Ram Gaya Ram's strategy
 vah bheed nahin juta rahi he, balki jo log kisi ko haraa sakate hai yaa jiske aane se koi kamazor ho saktaa he, bijepi main uskaa swaagat he
 BJP is constantly increasing its goals, the opponents are still not able to find goals
 ab sawaal uthta he ki kya vaaki desh main sirf bhaajapa hi bhaajapa hogi
 If Amit Shah made such machinery to win elections, then he should get a patent
 dilli kaa chunaav koi aisa vaisaa nahin he
 The launch pad is the launch of a rocket circling the orbit of democracy for 25 years for the BJP
 dilli ke chunaav par nazar rakhiye, aisi koi mashin banane vaali he

 The Akshay Kumar is known for his stamina
 narendra modi apane
 
 
 Known only for his stamina
 dialogbazi ke lihaaz se donon maiching hai
 Even if the lines of both are the same, we still know that the dialogue writer of both is not the same
 akshay apni mansapeshiyon se zyaada baat karte hai, or modi baahubal main yakeen karte hai
 The result remains the same - the screen and beyond, the apocalypse of the enemy
 akshay kumaar fitness freeq hai, na dhumrapaan karte hai, na sharaab pite hai
 Modi is just like that
 bo-rin-ga
 
 
 Both are up early in the morning
 bahut zyaada khud par dhyaan dene vaale
 Akshay Kumar does not get along with film industry colleagues
 or aise bhi bahut zyaada log nahin honge, jo narendra modi se niyamit rup se milanaa chaahate honge
 Akshay Kumar has Twinkle Khanna
 narendra modi ke paas amit shah hai
 Think for yourself 
 
 ab flop intervyuu kii baat karte hai
 
 
 Hmm
 
 
 kya yah 'kesari rang' main rangi sidhi-saadi baatcheet thi
 The film (akshay's 'kesari') has performed well at the box office, and does not need the Prime Minister's recommendation
 phir
 
 
 The First appears, Akshay's intriguing tweet
 Getting into an unknown and uncharted territory today
 Doing something i have never done before
 Excited and nervous both
 Stay tuned for updates
 or phir sab ghoshnaa kaa intazaar karne lage - akshay kumaar BJP main shaamil ho gaye hai
 It did not happen
 
 
 chunki bollywood ke bade sitaron main se aadhe aajkal alag-alag rajnatik dalon main shaamil ho rahe hai, or filmon se zyaada kama rahe hai, logon ne sochaa - chalo, ek or sahi
 
 
 But no, this was the teaser of this 'interview'
 is kaam ke liye akshay ko kyon chunaa gaya
 
 
 The Why not Vivek Oberoi
 
 
 ? anupam kher
 
 
 The Someone else loyal
 
 
 ? teenon khaanon main se koi kyon nahin
 
 
 The He certainly would have been very successful
 
 
 lekin khaanon main se koi 'aisa' kaam kyon karegaa
 
 
 The He is vicious, who would not want to get into any controversy among his fans, even if the money had to be stung
 haa, modi ji ko logon ko hairaan karne main, sarprize dene main mazaa aata he
 Concealed attacks instead of direct combat also suit his style
 khayr, sochakar dekhie - akshay kaaphi bade sitare hai, jinhone badhiya dhang se vafadari bhi sabit kii he
 Look at some of his previous films ('padman', 'gold')
 ve rajnatik sandeshon ko manoranjan kii chaashni main lapetakar dene kaa behtareen udhaaharan hai
 When i saw 'toilet - Ek Prem Katha', i was also impressed by the way the theme was introduced cleverly
 us vakt maine sochaa tha, akshay kumaar ne narendra modi ke svachh bharat abhiyaan kaa phayda uthaaya he
 Get rid of all the dirt
 lekin aaj hamaare aasapaas pehle se kahin zyaada gandagi maujuud he
 Someone asked me, "what was the rationale for this interview?" 
 
 ?" sawaal acha he, lekin koi jawaab
 
 
 The Anyone can give
 
 
 ? faisle ke din se pehle ise modi kii 'filmi style' main kii gai 'sargical strike' qaraar dena isaki tarif karnaa ho jayega
 As the clichéd talk continued, they moved on to meaningless things, and both of them strolled in the beautiful garden of the Prime Minister's House, all i could think was - if two bad actors try to give a blockbuster Do, which has no director, no screenwriter, no supporting actors, the result was bound to be a flop
 'walk da tok' to chhodie, karne laayak koi baat hi nahin thi
 Akshay jokingly asked, 'truth
 
 
 aap gujarati hai
 
 
 ? Just then, i turned off the TV
 akshay ne aisa kyon kiya
 
 
 The Why, Akshay, why
 
 
 ? akshay ne sirf ek baat sabit kii, manjhale darje kaa abhinayta intervyuu lene vaale ke taur par usase bhi bekaar sabit hota he
 Does anyone really want to know what the Prime Minister's opinion about mangoes is
 
 
 ? fishan ke bare main
 
 
 The Keep in mind, i have said fashion, the word fascism will not get confused
 
 
 thik he
 
 
 The 'khiladi Kumar' should focus on Taekwondo in future

 The country has seen a big movement for the demand of Lokpal
 is andolan ke garbh se ek party nikali or wo dilli kii satta par kabiz bhi ho gai
 The BJP also supported the movement heavily while in opposition
 janata ne spasht bahumat dekar centre main uski sarkaar banavaa di
 Today four years have passed for this government, but the country has not got a Lokpal
 takreeban saadhe chaar dashak se zyada samay se lataka hua lokapal bill saal 2013 ke ant main paas ho gaya tha
 After Anna Hazare's mass movement and massive public pressure, the UPA government passed it in December of 2013 and in January 2014 it received the President's approval
 uske baad may main nai endie sarkaar aa gai
 Four years have passed since then, there is also a law, but the government has not been able to appoint a Lokpal
 is vajah se sarkaar kii manshaa par bhi sawaal khadey kiye jate hai, ki vah lokapal kii niyukti karnaa bhi chaahati he yaa nahin
 It clearly states that, 'lokpal will investigate or get any complaint or allegations related to corruption, even if it is a matter related to the Prime Minister
 'haal main supreme court ne is maamle main sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaai thi, jiske baad gat march maheene main lokapal kii niyukti ke liye modi sarkaar ne ek meeting kii
 But there is nothing in the name of the result
 haal main rahul gandhi ne bhi lokapal niyukt na kar paane ke sawaal par twit kar sarkaar ko gheraa tha

 This time no one has got the status of Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa chunaavon main congress 44 par hi atak gai thi, jiske baad modi sarkaar ne congress ke kisi netaa ko netaa pratipaksh kaa darja dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 According to the rule, to become leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha, it is necessary to have 54 seats (ten percent of the total number of members of the Lok Sabha)
 agar modi sarkaar chaahati to is pech ko bahut pehle hi sulajhaa sakati thi
 Such a condition was earlier required for the appointment of CVC (chief Vigilance Officer), CIC (chief Information Officer) and even CBI Chief, but the selection rules of all three have been amended and replaced with 'leader of Opposition' as the most

 lokapal ke liye bhi aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 The Supreme Court's strictness On 27 April 2017, the Supreme Court, while ruling in the case of appointment of Lokpal, said that the Lokpal Act can be acted upon without modification

 Lokpal can be appointed without leader opposition

 is samiti main pradhanmantri bhi shaamil hai
 a bench of Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice r Bhanumathi was informed by Attorney General KK Venugopal that steps had been taken to appoint the Lokpal and the Prime Minister, Chief Justice, Lok Sabha Speaker and the largest opposition parties on March 1 to discuss the issue
 There will be a meeting of the selection committee with the leader of

 In the Lok Sabha's displeasure, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge turned down the invitation of the Central Government
 khadge ne pradhanmantri narendra modi likhe patr main kaha ki baithak main vishesh aamantrit sadsy ke rup main aamantran dekar vipaksh kii awaz ko dabaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Kharge is not a leader of the opposition, due to which the Modi government had invited the Congress leader in the Lok Sabha to attend the meeting as a 'special invitation'
 is baithak memloksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan, piem narendra modi or sijeai deepak mishra ne hissaa liya
 In a letter to PM Modi, Kharge said, "the invitation specifically sent is a concerted effort to exclude the voice of the opposition from the selection process of the most important anti-corruption watchdog group

 a large number of Biharis have to spend the night in Nepal police custody
 unhen jurmaana bharna padataa he
 Police in Nepal's Rautahat district said that at least 70 Indian nationals were fined one thousand rupees each for being caught drinking in dozens of huts like mushrooms in the Nepalese region bordering Bihar
 ye jhopadiyaan asthaayee hai jo bharat ke sharaab-pramiyon ke liye banaai gai thim
 Rautahat Superintendent of Police Ganesh Regmi said that last week we collected fines from 70 Indian nationals who came here for drinking
 bhartiya nagarikon ko ek raat ke liye hawalat main rakhaa gaya or duusare din unhen chhod diya gaya
 On Saturday, the police apprehended nine Indian nationals and kept them in lockup
 unhone bataaya ki unase dobaaraa sharaab pine ke liye nepali seemaa main nahin dikhne ke likhit main vachan lene ke baad duusare din unhen choda gaya
 The police have started action against temporary liquor shops in the wake of fears of increase in crime due to short duration of Indian drunkards coming to Nepali area
 bhartiya sharaabiyon kii talash main police jhopadiyon main chal rahi sharaab kii dukaanon par har roj chaape maarthi he
 The Indian Police is also working closely with its Nepalese counterpart to monitor the flow of Indian nationals in Nepal, as this may affect crime on the open border between India and Nepal
 bharat-nepal ke bich antarrashtriya seemaa khuli he
 People are allowed to move on both sides after regular security checks
 ab nepali police se bachane ke liye bharat kesharab-preminepal ke shaharon main shaam ke samay aate hai, sharaab pite hai or raat bitaane ke baad duusare din laut jate hai
 Liquor shops have increased in Nepal's border areas
 rajasthan main ausat matdaan ne jahaan ummidavaaron ke hausalon ko post kar diya, vahiin gujars-meena ilaakon main ummid ke mutabik takaraav dikhaai diya
 As a result, a 33-year-old youth was killed in police firing
 lekin kul milakar pradesh main 7 may ko loksabhaa chunaav ke liye matdaan shantipurna tareeke se sampann ho gaya
 Like the mood of the entire country, barely half of the voters in the state came out of the house to cast their votes, whereas two-thirds of the voters had cast their votes a few months earlier
 isse yah bhi pataa chalata he ki rajasthan ke logon kii rashtriya masalon main khaas dilchaspee nahin he or unhen is baat kii bhi khaas phikr nahin he ki centre main kiski sarkaar ban rahi he
 This situation is when several national leaders visited the state last week after being freed from other states
 yahi vajah he ki pradesh main aamtaur par in chunaavon ko is nazariye se dekha ja rahaa he ki ye pradesh ke netritv par asar daalenge
 The future of the candidates will also be seen in relation to the increasing or decreasing influence of Congress Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 vastav main kisi bhi party ko mili kul siton kii sankhya gahalot or raaje ke rajnatik kad par bada asar daalegi
 And they will try to strengthen themselves on the basis of victory or defeat of big leaders

 P
 joshi kii jeet kaa matlab he congress ke bheetar ek or satta centre kaa nirmaan or unki haar kaa matlab hoga gahalot ko ab kisi se chunauti nahin
 Similarly, if Sachin Pilot loses, then one seat of the party decreases but Gehlot will emerge as the only leader
 jabaki unki jeet kaa istemaal yah dikhaane ke liye kiya jayega ki gujaron ne bhi congress ko vot diya
 Initially it seemed that Chandresh Kumari would win easily from Jodhpur, but later reports coming from there have raised questions about such projections; The two members of the Congress Raj families are also not convinced about the victory of Jitendra Singh from Alwar and Ijiraj Singh from Kota
 congress ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe rajpariwaron ke sadasyon kaa pradarshan dikhayega ki rajput vot kis had tak bhaajapa se khisak kar congress ke paale main aa gaye hai
 Apart from this, Jyoti Mirdha's victory will reduce the legacy of Jat leadership in the family of Nathuram Mirdha
 is par nazren gadaaye anek jat netaaon ne unhen haraane ke liye kaam kiya bilkul usee tarah jis tarah se unhone chandresh kumari ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 As far as independents are concerned, Buta Singh from Jalore is the only candidate whose future is at stake
 isi tarah yah dekhnaa bhi dilachasp hoga ki savai madhopur kii saamaanya seat se congress ke namo narayan meena kaisaa pradarshan karte hai jahaan karnal kirodi singh bansla kaa bhavishya daanv par laga hua he
 Bainsla is desperate to win because he wants to keep the Gujar issue alive
 kirodi laal meena kaa congress prem feekaa padataa ja rahaa he, dausa main unki raah bhi mushkil he
 His victory will make it difficult for Gehlot, his defeat will reduce his stature
 jahaan tak bhaajapa kii baat he to yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki barmer main maanavendra singh kaisaa pradarshan karte hai kyonki unki shuruyaat kamjor rahi thi
 Ghanshyam Tiwari is looking ahead of his Congress rival Mahesh Joshi in Jaipur
 har kisi kii najar dushyant singh par kyonki unki jeet se vasundhara raaje kaa hausala badhegaa
 But overall it seems that Gehlot's future is far more at stake in these elections than Raje's

 On Monday, his 'gotra' was asked on behalf of the BJP at the Mahakaleshwar Temple in Ujjain by Congress President Adhyakshahul Gandhi
 is bich rahul gandhi ne daawa kiya he ki wo hindu dharm ke bare main bijepi se behatar samajhate hai
 i understand Hinduism better than BJP
 Actually, on the last day of Madhya Pradesh, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had a program of meeting with journalists in Indore 
 is dauraan unhone ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, "aapke paas ek khubi honi chahie, wo he humility (vinamrata)
 Humility means that when you are speaking, i am listening to you, trying to understand you
 main ye nahin kah rahaa hum ki agar koi gussa ho rahaa he to wo bevakoof he
 If someone is getting angry then i want to understand why anger is happening
 bijepi ke log hindu gharm ko samajhate hi nahin hai, inase behatar hindu dharm ko main samajhataa hum
 "the Congress president had a program of interaction with businessmen and entrepreneurs in Indore itself after the BJP loudspeaker system met with the letterwriters
 is kaarykram main soshal media par bhraamak prachaar se jude ek sawaal ke jawaab main rahul gandhi ne kaha, ''modi sarkaar ke paas mere bare main bhraamak prachaar karne ke liye bajet he

 a meeting of heads of financial management agencies with the Election Commission identified at least 150 Lok Sabha constituencies across the country in which the most illegal money is recovered during elections
 jaahir he jitna pakadaa jaataa he usase kahin zyada to chunaav main khap jaataa hoga
 This time for the first time, the Election Commission's intelligence will be eyeing it in these Lok Sabha circles
 ayog iske liye special objarwar kii team bhi in ilaakon main tainaat karegaa
 According to the director of the Electoral Spending Monitoring Department of the Commission, the meeting on Friday was attended by heads of several financial management institutions such as the Economic Offenses Wing, including CBDT, Income Tax Department, Economic Intelligence Department, Chief of Paramilitary Forces
 baithak main charchaa is baat par bhi hui ki aapas main khufia soochnaaon kaa aadan-pradaan samay rahete ho or us par miljul kar fouran or sateek karrwai ho to chunaav main kaale dhan ke istemaal ko na keval roka ja saktaa he, balki aisa karne waalon main man main kanoon kaa dar bhi baithegaa
 It was decided that till the end of the election process all the departments would be engaged in this campaign seven days and twenty four hours
 is babat ection kaa rodmap bhi taiyaar kiya gaya he
 In addition to the traditional methods of transportation of black money according to the experience gained in the last elections, cutting-edge methods of monitoring the transactions being made through modern technology were also discussed
 chunavi halchal ke dauraan sirf dhan hi nahin balki sharaab, nakli note, drugs aadi kii bhi taskari in dinon bad jaati he un par nigaah rakhi jaaegi
 Along with inter-state borders, international borders and maritime borders are also being increased for this surveillance
 ayog main hui baithak main is baat par bhi charchaa hui ki tamilnadu kii sabhi siten in vittiya samvedansheel daayre main hai
 Apart from this, in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Bihar, Jharkhand and Gujarat, a large number of illegal money, liquor and drugs were caught in the last elections
 andhrapradesh main to 175 main se 110 vidhaan sabha halake avaidh dhan ke maamle main na keval samvedansheel hai balki badnaam bhi
 Therefore, in these states, the Commission is also running a campaign to keep people aware through Citizen Vigil ie Sea Vigil Mobile App, so that people too can be alert and alert about this
 ayog kaa kahana he ki ap ke jariye jaankaree dene vaale nagarikon ke naam or pahchaan gupt rakhi jaaegi

 When it became difficult to move forward, the Center turned to the states
 narendra modi sarkaar ne bhoomi adhigrahan bill par takaraav ke hal ke liye baanto or kanoon banaao chaal apanaai haih rajyon ko jameen ke maamle main apana kanoon banane kaa vikalp dekar rajyasabha main vipaksh ke adigalapan ko bhothra kar do
 If this bill is not passed in the Rajya Sabha in the monsoon session of Parliament, then the bjp-led government may bring for proper compensation and transparency in the land acquisition, Rehabilitation (second Amendment) Ordinance & for the fourth time which seeks amendment in the 2013 law
 isse bhi zyada ahm tathy yah he ki vah rajyon kii ore rukh karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Prime Minister Modi is not hesitant to get it passed in Parliament because he will not be able to gather the required numbers in the Rajya Sabha, but because he feels that the government is losing the perception battle with the opposition
 bihar ke chunaav main sirf teen maheene baaki rah gaye hai or assam, kerala or pashchim bengal main ek saal ke bheetar chunaav hone vaale hai, aise main bijepi bilkul nahin chaahati he ki vah kisi bhi tareeke se kisaan virdohi najar aae
 In the NDA meeting on 20 July, Modi accepted this fact
 unhone kaha ki upie-2 ke 2013 ke kanoon main kiye gaye sanshodhano ko logon ne pasand nahin kiya he or ab us dharna ko sudhaarney kaa samay aa gaya he
 This changed stance of the Prime Minister may disappoint those BJP leaders who were working hard to pass the land acquisition bill from behind the scenes
 235 sadasyon ke sadan main bijepi ke 46 sadasyon ke mukaable 68 sadasyon vaali congress ne rajyasabha main duusari vipakshi partiyon ke samarthan se bajet satr main is bill ko rasta diya tha
 The bill was referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee, which would submit its report in the first week of August
 congress or vampanthi partiyaan chaahati hai ki yah bill rajyasabha main lambit rahe kyonki agar ise voting ke liye pesh kiya gaya or vidheyak gir gaya to sarkaar ko sansad kaa sanyukt satr bulaane kaa mauka mil jayega, jisamen sarkaar ko jeet hasil karne kii puri ummid he, kyonki loksabhaa main uske paas acha bahumat he
 CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury has officially stated that the first goal of his party will be that the government should not call a joint session
 sansad ke bajet or monsoon satr ke bich kii avadhi main bijepi congress ko chhodkar baaki sabhi vipakshi partiyon se sampark kar chuki thi or unke saath ek sauda kar liya tha, jise donon pakshon kii jeet mana ja rahaa tha
 It included Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress, Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party (SP), Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Naveen Patnaik's Biju Janata Dal (BJD) and J
C
 jayalalita kii eiediemke jaisi vipakshi partiyon ke liye sunishchit kar diya gaya tha ki ve rajyasabha main bhoomi adhigrahan bill kaa virodh karne ke apane rukh par kaayam rahen, jisase sadan main bill gir jaae
 a Congress member in the Rajya Sabha cautions, "mulayam, Mayawati, Mamta Banerjee, Jayalalithaa and Naveen Patnaik will indirectly help Modi by voting against the bill
 ”yah ranneeti kaagaj par to kaamyaab dikhti he&donon sadanon kii kul sadsy sankchaya 788 he, jisamen endie ke paas 395 sadsy hai
 Of these, BJP has 327 mps of its own
 lekin bijepi kii sahyogi partiyon ne is prakriya main adnga daal diya he
 The Shiromani Akali Dal and Shiv Sena are openly opposing the bill
 bijedy or eiediemke loksabhaa main iske paksh main vot dene ke baad jis tarah se is bill par phir se vichaar kar rahi hai, usase bijepi ko us samay munh kii khaani pad sakati he, jab akali dal or shivasena bhi sanyukt satr ke dauraan virodh kaa rasta akhriyaar kar len
 The BJP has 68 seats falling short of a majority
 yahi vajah he ki pradhanmantri ab apana lakshya sansad ke jariye nahin, balki vidhansabhaon ke jariye hasil karnaa chaahate hai
 The idea of leaving the way of Parliament was first coined in the second Governing Council of NITI Aayog held in Delhi on 15 July
 haalanki congress ke mukhyamantriyon ne is baithak kaa bahishkaar kiya tha, lekin 16 main se 10 mukhyamantriyon ne, jinamein bijepi ke 8 mukhyamantri shaamil the, pradhanmantri ko bataaya ki kendriya kanoon main deree hone se vikaas ke kaam main rukaawat aa rahi he
 In a cabinet meeting held on the first day of the monsoon session on July 21, Modi indicated that the government could now bring a provision that could give states the option to enact their own laws
 is prakaar jahaan bhoomi adhigrahan bill sansad main ab bhi fansaa hua he, vahiin kai rajya, jinamein bijepi shasit aath rajya bhi shaamil hai, jaldi hi apana bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon bana sakate hai
 Other non-congress ruled states such as Uttar Pradesh & which have allowed direct negotiation between buyers and sellers for the 302 km expressway between Agra and Lucknow & Andhra Pradesh & Telangana & both want to create land banks for faster development & so on
 Can express interest in the provision of samvidhan ke anuchhed 254 (2) ke tahat rajyon ko centre evam raashtrapati kii sahmati se kai maamalon main alag kanoon banane kaa adhikaar hasil he
 Eight states & West Bengal, Jammu & Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana had their own laws before the 2013 legislation was passed using this provision
 21 july ko modi kii ore se rajyon ko hari jhandi diya janaa is baat kaa bhi sanket he ki ve chahen to apane kanoon main jameen ke maalik kii sahmati or soshal impact assesament (esaiye) vaali vivaadaaspad shart banaae rakh sakate hai
 The central government has long claimed that many of the main projects were being delayed due to these two provisions & which the UPA-2 government included as "security"
 2013 ke kanoon main nijee projects ke maamle main bhoomi ke adhigrahan ke liye 80 fisadi or nijee-sarkari projects (pipipi) ke maamle main 70 fisadi jameen maalikon kii sahmati lenaa jaruri tha
 The amended bill of the NDA, which has been passed in the Lok Sabha, excludes five sections from this provision
 ye paanch varg hai&suraksha, gramin buniyadi dhaancha, sasta awaas, audyogic galiyara or pipipi samet dhanchaagat project
 The 2013 law provided for a SIA for families affected by land acquisition, but it has been removed in the amended bill
 lekin sarkari aankade narendra modi sarkaar ke is daawey kii tasdik nahin karte hai ki upie ke banaae kanoon kii vajah se projects ke kaam main baadha aa rahi he
 In response to an RTI, the Ministry of Finance has stated that as of February 2015, 804 projects were stalled, but only 66 projects & that is only 8% were being hampered due to land acquisition problems
 baharhaal, desh ke anndaata kisaanon or jameen ke maalikon kaa dil jeetne kii ladaai main is tarah ke tathy zyada mahatv nahin rakhte
 Due to opposition uproar in Parliament, the government is now looking to resort to state legislatures in the name of federal structure
 kya sarkaar kii yah chaal kaamyaab ho paaegi?thth1 bhoomi adhigrahan kya he?bhoomi adhigrahan nijee milkiyat vaali jameen ko samaaj ke vyapak hit main sarkaar yaa nijee companiyon kaa jabaran apane niyantran main lenaa he
 This is not a case of buying land in which there is no compulsion or obligation to sell the land to the landowner
 2 itnashorsharaba kyon he?2013 tak bhoomi adhigrahan ke maamalon main bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon 1894 lagu hota tha
 The UPA passed the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Resettlement and Rehabilitation, which enacted a new framework and rules
 endie ne upie ke bhoomi kanoon main kuch ahm badlaav kiye or march main loksabhaa main sanshodhan paarit karwaae
 Opposition parties alleged that the changes were made to benefit corporate groups
 3 in sanshodhano kii jarurat kyon thi?nae vidheyak ke himytiyon ke mutabik in sanshodhano kii jarurat isliye thi kyonki upie ke kanoon ke kuch nishchit praavdhaanon&masalan, 80 fisadi jameen maalikon kii manjuuri&kii vajah se nijee companiyon ke liye bhoomi adhigrahan takreeban naammumkin ho gaya
 As a result, investment and development work came to a standstill
 4 adhigrahan ke masalon kii vajah se kitni pariyojnaayen thap hai?vitt mantralay ne ek artiai ke jawaab main bataaya tha ki farvari, 2015 tak 804 pariyojnaayen thap padi thim
 However, out of these 804, only 66 or 8 per cent of the projects are stalled due to land acquisition problems
 5 ab kyasthiti he?bijepi sarkaar bhoomi adhigrahan, punarsthaapan or punarvaas main uchit muaavje or paardarshita kaa adhikaar (doosraa sanshodhan) vidheyak 2015 ko kanoon main nahin badal paa rahi he
 She has implemented this bill three times through an ordinance
 vidheyak march main loksabhaa main paarit ho gaya tha, lekin rajyasabha ne ise sanyukt sansadeey samiti ko bhej diya, jo apni report agast ke pehle hafte main degi
 What changes have been made by the NDA government in UPA vs ndaupa's Land Acquisition Act
 The LARR Act, 2013 80 per cent of landowners' consent is required for private projects, 70 per cent for PPP projects and none for government projects
 sabhi project ke liye saamaajik prabhaav akalan anivaary, sirf dhara 40 main bataae gaye ahm maamalon ko yaa sinchai project (jinamein paryaavaran prabhaav akalan jaruri he) ko chhodkar
 Irrigated multi-cropped land cannot be acquired beyond a certain limit
 sabhi projects ke liye krishi bhoomi kaa adhigrahan kul boe gaye kheton se zyada nahin hona chahie
 Under this law, if the land is not used for five years after occupation, it has to be returned to the original land owners or the land bank
 elearaar kanoon 2013 un maamalon par bhi lagu hoga, jinamein jameen iske ke lagu hone se paanch saal yaa pehle di gai he, par jameen kaa bhautik kabja nahin liya gaya he yaa muaavja adaa nahin hua he
 The provisions of the law will apply even when land is being acquired for private purpose for private companies
 jo adhyadesh lagu kiyaaraksha, gramin buniyadi dhaancha, audyogic galiyaaron, buniyadi dhaancha or saamaajik buniyadi dhaancha ke liye sahmati kii jarurat nahin
 This exempts the government from social impact assessment for projects falling under the five categories mentioned above
 yah sarkaar ko paanch shreniyon ke tahat aane vaale project ko chhot dene kii ijaajat detaa he
 The land will have to be returned either after the stipulated time at the beginning of the project or after five years, whichever comes later
 jameen dene or bhautik kabja lene ke bich ke saal ginate samay ve do saal nahin gine jaaenge jo adalati mukademebaaji main bekaar chale gaye
 The term "private company" was replaced with "private entity"
 “privet antity” sarkari sanstha se itar sanstha he
 Social infrastructure is not in every untouched project passed in Lok Sabha
 audyogic galiyare kii pahchaan spasht kiru aise galiyare jo sarkaar@sarkari upkram sthapit karenge
 These will be up to one km on either side of the road @ railway
 aisi chhot se pehle sarkaar ko yah pakkaa karnaa hoga ki jo jameen adhigrahit ho rahi he, vah project ke liye nunatam jaruri jameen he
 Before such exemption, the government must ensure that the land being acquired is the minimum required land for the project
 adhyadesh main koi badlaav nahin
 No change in ordinance
 adhyadesh main koi badlaav nahin
 Most of the objections made are in the same five categories of acquisitions, so it will destroy all the security measures made in the 2013 law
 congress ke mutabik saamaajik prabhaav kaa akalan karne kii sarkaar kii jimmedaari ko lekar koi samjhauta nahin ho saktaa
 This is derived from the social impact assessment process laid down in the 2013 law
 sarkaar ne isaki bajaae prabhavit pariwaron kii tasalli ke liye maamuli baat jod di he
 This has weakened the law and it benefits the government by holding it accountable for the delay in using the land
 isse supreme court kii nirdhaarit “muaavja adaa kiya gaya” kii paribhaasha ko nishprabhavi kar diya gaya he
 The word privateity, rather than a private company, confirmed that anyone could request a government takeover
 mukhyamantri farmaate hainjahan kuch mukhyamantriyon ne samarthan diya, vahiin kai duusare mukhyamantri sarkaar kii tarah nahin sochtesamarthan menen
 Chandrababu Naidu, Andhra Pradesh is desperate for land for the new capital of his state

 ' What is going to happen in Ram temple-babri Masjid dispute? Hearing this question, 68-year-old Kaushal Kishore, who lives in front of the Sri Rangavatika temple in Muhalla Ramkot, located in the north of the disputed campus in Ayodhya, gets a glow
 ayodhya main vivaadit dhaancha dhwans ke baad 1993 main ayodhya act ke jariye centre sarkaar ne vivaadit sthal ke aasapaas takreeban 79 acre kshetra kaa adhigrahan kar liya tha
 After this, around 400 families of Ramkot and Vibhishan Kund wards adjacent to the acquired premises were under heavy security
 kaushal kishor kaa parivaar bhi inhen main se ek tha jisane ram mandir-babari masjid vivaad kii badi keemat chukaai he
 Kaushal Kishore, the only child of parents, used to run Prasad's ancestral shop outside the house
 adhigrahan ke baad ramkot ilaake main aam shraddhaluon kaa pravesh band ho gaya, parinamswaroop kaushal kishor ko dukaan band kerani padi
 Staying out of Ayodhya for a few years, he spent his wages by working, but the deteriorating health of the elderly parents forced him to stay in the Ramkot locality
 ramkot muhalle kaa suraksha gheraa itnaa kadaa tha ki yahaan mangalik yaa anya tarah ke aayojan bilkul band ho gaye
 Due to family compulsions, Kaushal Kishore did not marry and devotedly engaged in the service of parents
 samay gujarata gaya or isi dauraan mata-pita kaushal kishor ko akelaa chhodkar antim yatra par nikal gaye
 Kaushal Kishore then tried to stand on his feet
 2006 main tempo kharidkar chalaanaa shuru kiya, par 2007 main faijabad kachhari main hue bam blast ke baad vivaadit parisar kii suraksha or kadi kar di gai
 It was very difficult for him to travel to Ramkot with a tempo
 kuch din baad unhone tempo chalaanaa band kar diya
 Due to the tight security, due to many restrictions in any kind of construction work in Ramkot locality, his ancestral house has now reached a very shabby condition
 ghar ke baahar kabad haalat main khadaa tempo unki badahaali kii kahani bayaan kar rahaa he
 Kaushal Kishore says, "the Ram Janmabhoomi and Babri Masjid dispute has brought the lives of the people of Ramkot neighborhood to jail
 supreme court is vivaad ko sulajhaa detaa he to yahaan ke logon ko sangeenon ke saaye se aazaadee mil sakegi
 30-year-old Chandrasekhar Maurya, a teacher in a government school in Durahi Kuan area of ramkot locality, about two hundred meters from Kaushal Kishore's house, has been bored since childhood under the supervision of security personnel
 chandrashekhar bataate hai, ''kade suraksha ghere ke kaaran koi bhi rishtedaar mere ghar nahin aata
 It is impossible even for the people living in Ramkot locality to reach their homes without an identity card

 "around two and a half thousand people living in Ramkot and Vibhishan Kund wards of Ayodhya are eagerly awaiting the Supreme Court's decision on the Ram mandir-babri Masjid dispute
" inhen main ramkot muhalle ke pracheen mandir kaushalya bhawan ke sangrakshak 30 varshiya abhishek treepathi bhi hai
 At the time of acquisition of the disputed premises in 1993, further portion including the main gate of Kaushalya Bhavan came under the purview of acquisition
 abhishek bataate hai, ''adhigrahan kii jad main aane ke baad se sheshavatar, sakshi gopal, maanas bhawan, vishwamitra ashram jaise prasiddh mandiron main puja paath thap ho gaya
 Their buildings also became dilapidated

 Kalyan Singh set up a huge police force in Ayodhya but refused to stop the kar sevaks in any way
 nateeja badi sankhya main karsevak 6 disambar ko ayodhya pahunch gaye or vivaadit dhaancha dhaha diya gaya
 The second model of security is that of former Chief Minister Mayawati in November 2010

 Security was tightened by deploying central police force at every sensitive place

 english film thi
 Big Production

 As an actress, i want to play different types of characters

 a blue haired lesbian girl can be a mother
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki 'blue ij da varmust color' kaa role bond girl se zyada intens tha?'blue ij da varmust color' ek level par bahut hi mushkil role tha
 Scene was very intense
 lekin kai baar intencity hi mushkil nahin hoti
 'blue is the Warmest' was a completely different film in color process
 bond badi film he or uski apni kai chunautiyaan hai
 You said somewhere that you hate the fact that you have worked in 'blue is the Warmest Color', why not?

 You made James Bond a Feminist? Totally
 jitne vah feminist hai utane hi striyochit bhi
 He has shown that he can also lose
 unki bhi kai kamajoriyaan he
 i can say that Daniel is a Feminist and so this time Bond is also a Feminist
 monica beluchi ke bare main kya kahana he?monicabahut hi mast or sexi hai

 The government has canceled the registration of ngos under the Foreign Fund Regulation Act for allegedly working against the country's economic progress

 gujarat ke purv grih rajyamantri amit shah kaa nayaa pataa yahi he
 Amit Shah, caught in the CBI clutches, was sent to judicial custody for 14 days by the court on Sunday
 ab wo salaakhon ke peeche hai, to duusari ore sibiai sawaalon se ghiri he
 In the Sohrabuddin encounter case, the Amit Shah whom the CBI was looking for with vigor, came out on Sunday, then the CBI did not think it necessary to take him on remand
 sibiai ne gujarat ke purv grih rajyamantri ko court main pesh karke apana kaam puraa kar liya or sibiai court ne shah ko bhej diya 14 din kii nyaayik hiraasat main
 At present, Amit Shah is housed in the Tilak cottage in Sabarmati jail, where Bal Gangadhar Tilak was in the freedom movement
 jail kaa tilak kutir bada-sa haul he, jisaki chat khapril kii bani hui he
 Amit Shah was already expected to go to jail, which is why the jail authorities had gutted the bathroom and toilet of Tilak cottage
 amit shah ko jail main ghar kaa bana khaanaa bhi muhaiyaa karavaaya ja rahaa he
 The CBI had filed a 2000-page charge sheet against Amit Shah before he surrendered
 ab is par bhi sawaal uth rahe hai ki aakhir sibiai ne shah ko saman bhejne ke fouran baad chargeshit kaise taiyaar kar lee
 Why did the CBI not wait for Amit Shah to be caught before filing the chargesheet in the court? Currently, instead of answering these questions, the CBI is preparing to file its investigation report in the Supreme Court

 This is the 'youth', just the way of writing is different
 vaise to is film ke saath koi super star, yaa bada naam nahin judaa he, lekin kya ye film aapako theatre tak khinchne main safal ho paaegi , iskaa pataa lagane ke liye aaie film kii samiksha karte hai:kahani:uva 5 doston salmaan, deenabandhu, vikram, ram or anil kii kahani he, jo dilli se sate noida main rahete hai or ek saath skool jaaya karte hai

 alag-alag ghatnakramon main inkaa saamana police tejavir singh (jimmy shergill) or jaj (parakshit saahani) se bhi hota he or aakhirkaar vyay ke liye in yuvaaon ko ladanaa padataa he
 Script, acting: The subject of the film is old, but the way of presenting it has not been changed
 screenple kaaphi kamjor he or kuch kirdaaron ko chhodkar baaki over acting karte hue najar aate hai
 The film is very big and the way of presenting makes it even more boring and after a while you do not stop laughing even on the serious scene
 film main hindi teacher bane sanjay mishra, or salmaan ke kirdaar main mohit bhaghel kahin-kahin aapako hansaate hai, lekin kuch kirdaar aise bhi hai jo bharsak koshish karte hai kii aap thodaa bhi muskura den, lekin unka prayaas asafal hi rahata he
 In reality shows like tv's Bigg Boss, Sangram Singh's acting as a coach seems quite dull and while Tanu Weds Manu Returns' Raja Awasthi aka Jimmy Shergill is also seen acting in a few scenes
 film main kai nae chehron ko jagah di gayi he, jiskaa phayda in actors ko aane vaali filmon main jarur milegaa
 Music: There is not a single song in the film that pulls you towards it and during the film these songs seem irrational
 kyon dekhen:is film rivyuu main upar likhe actors ke agar aap jabardast fain hai to theatre tak jarur jaaen
 Why not watch: There are some movies that you can watch in pieces, while changing the channel with the TV remote and it is the same type of film

 Without naming Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath on the issue of electricity in the state, he said that he is giving 24 hours electricity to UP, but a Baba of Gorakhpur is alleging that there is no electricity there
 unhone chutile andaaj main kaha ki vah gorakhpur ke baba ko chunauti dete hai ki vah bijli ke kisi taar ko pakadakar dikhaaen, jisase pataa chale ki vahaan par bijli aa rahi he yaa nahin

 gujarat main rajyasabha chunaav ko lekar congress supreme court pahunch gai he
 Congress has filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the Election Commission notification for two seats
 amit shah or smriti irani dwaara khaali kii gai siton par ek saath chunaav karaane kii maang kii gai he
 The Gujarat Congress termed the Election Commission's decision to hold separate by-elections in the two Rajya Sabha seats of the state as "unconstitutional", alleging that the ruling BJP is pressurizing the Election Commission to win both the seats
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki ek hi din donon siton par alag-alag chunaav karana asanvaidhanik or samvidhan kii bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 Elections will be held on five July in the Rajya Sabha vacant seats from Gujarat
 daramil chunaav ayog kii adhisuchana ke mutabik amit shah ko loksabhaa chunaav jeetne kaa pramaan-patr 23 may ko hi mil gaya tha, jabaki smriti irani ko 24 may ko mila
 This made a difference of one day in both elections
 isi aadhaar par ayog ne rajya kii donon siton ko alag-alag mana he, lekin chunaav ek hi din honge
 Due to this, BJP will win both the seats, because first preference votes will be decided afresh
 ek saath chunaav hote to congress ko ek seat mil jaati
 The candidate needs 61 votes to win the Rajya Sabha election in Gujarat by number strength
 ek hi bailat par chunaav se ummidavaar ek hi vot daal paaegaa
 In this situation, the Congress could easily take a seat as it has 71 mlas
 lekin chunaav ayog ke notification ke mutabik, vidhayak alag-alag vot karenge
 In such a situation, they will get a chance to vote twice
 is tarah bijepi ke vidhayak, jinaki sankhya 100 se zyada he, do baar vot karke donon ummidavaaron ko jitwa sakate hai

 According to the power workers, there is a technical fault in many transmission lines behind it, which is being worked to remove it as soon as possible
 dilli transko limited ke adhikariyon ke mutabik pichley dinon aae tufaan kii vajah se kai jagahon par line baadhit hui he, jis vajah se sahi supplai nahin ho paa rahi he, karmchaaree inhen thik karne main lage hai or agle do se teen din main supplai ko sucharu kar diya jayega

 ) i am a student myself, so understand how difficult it is for boys to buy condoms
 sirf dikkat nahin hoti he, kai baar medical store vaala aisi najaron se dekhtaa he ki lagata he condom nahin kisi kii jaan maang lee he
 These things were going on in my mind for many days and then the idea of condom delivery came up
 ye bilkul usee tarah jis tarah aap online pizza mangavate hai
 Sirhan Seth is the owner of a startup
 SMS Contraceptive naam kaa ye starop condom delivery karata he
 Not just condoms, lubricants, pills and pregnancy test kits too
 wo bhi sirf 30 minute main
 Along with Gurgaon, this service is also available in parts of South Delhi
 SMS Contraceptive par choubis ghante order place kar sakate hai
 You can call, drop the message on the Watts-app and can also order on Snapchat
 seth ne ye start-ap farvari main register karaayaa tha lekindelivery kaa kamunhone das din pehle hi shuru kiya he
 He has a team of four with Sirhan
 jisamen se do log delivery kaa kaam karte hai or do log back-and par kaam sambhalate hai
 When asked about Sethi's experience of these 10 days, he said that out of all the orders he has received so far, about 60 to 70 per cent of the calls were from girls
 sethi khud bhi is baat se chaunke
 But they consider it a worthwhile initiative
 sethi bataate hai ki unhone apane ghar main kabhi bhi is kaam ko chipaaya nahin
 Everyone in his house knows that he has a condom business
 sethi maanate hai condom ko lekar jis tarah log chuppi saadh lete hai wo galat he
 It is like any other medicine that can be avoided by any disease or danger
 jab ham medical store par crosine yaa aspirin kharidte hai to ekbar bhi jhijakte nahin hai lekin condom, lubricant, pills yaa phir pregnancy test kit kharidne main aise sharmaate hai jaise kuch galat kaam kar rahe hon
 It is funny that this shame is not only in the eyes of the buyer but also in the eyes of the seller
 kai ladke to ek dukaan fiks kar lete hai
 They go to the shop, the working boy understands them on seeing them
 kaali panni main yaa paper ke packet main condom rakhata he or chupchaap laakar thama detaa he
 Talking about girls, they are so hesitant to buy their sanitary pads, condoms are a very big thing
 SMS Contraceptive emarpy rate par condom nahin dete
 These condoms are available at a premium price
 sirhaan is bijness ko ek chunauti to maanate hai lekin ashavan bhi hai
 He says with confidence that as long as people keep double character about condom and sex, then this business will also run
 haalanki wo online bijness ke jokhimon se bhi inkaar nahin karte
 Sirhan is yet to deal with any condom making company
 wo hole-cell par condom kharidte hai or unhen deliver karte hai

 motor whical act par centre banaam rajyakai rajyon ne chaalaan raashi main kii katauteembhjhf shasit kai rajya bhi is list main shamilsadak par laal batti paar kar janaa yaa phir bina helmet ke dopahiyaa vaahan ko chalaanaa beete kuch samay se bharat kii sadakon par aam baat ho rahi thi
 To change this perception, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari's ministry brought a policy of imposing heavy penalties for breaking traffic rules
 1 sitambar ko kanoon lagu hua or 11 sitambar tak uskaa jugad bhi nikal gaya
 Many state governments, including bjp-ruled states, refused to implement the law or halved the fine
 ek desh ek vidhaan kii baat karne vaali bhartiya janata party kii prachand bahumat vaali sarkaar apni hi rajya sarkaron se centre dwaara paarit kanoon lagu nahin karvaa pai
 So far, the states which have reduced the challan penalty amount, here is their list
 
 
 1
 Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, first adopted the redemptive method of this rule
 rajya ke mukhyamantri vijay roopaani ne kai jurmaanon par baari chhot kaa elaan kar diya
 The Gujarat government has cut the average by 90 per cent
 jaise ambulance kaa rasta rokane par 10 hajaar kii jagah 1 hajaar, bike par overlod par 1 hajaar kii jagah 100 rupee, bina registration kii bike par 5 hajaar kii jagah sirf ek hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana
 2
 maharashtraik or bhaajapa shasit rajya maharashtra ne bhi is kanoon ke aage haath khadey kar die hai
 Maharashtra is also the home state of Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari
 gaur karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki maharashtra main kuch hi maheenon main chunaav hone vaale hai, aise main rajya ke mukhiy denvendra fadanvis koi risk nahin lenaa chaahate hai
 The Transport Minister of Maharashtra is also going to write a letter to Nitin Gadkari on this issue
 3
 Uttarakhand, the bjp-ruled state of Uttarakhand, also described the penalty amount as very high
 mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ne rajya main nae motor whical act main sanshodhan kiya or kai jurmaane kii raashi aadhi kar di
 For example, a fine of Rs 2500 instead of 5000 for driving without a license
 4
 Like Maharashtra, elections are going to be held in Jharkhand in a few months and there is a worry about votes here
 rajya main bhi nayaa motor whical act lagu nahin hua he or rajya sarkaar ne pehle hi jurmaane main katautee ke sanket de die hai
 The penalty amount may be cut in Jharkhand after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit on Thursday
 5
 Haryana elections are due in Haryana this year and the head of state Manohar Lal Khattar has just refused to implement the new Motor Vehicle Act
 rajya sarkaar kii ore se puure haryana main trephic niyamon ke liye jaagruk abhiyaan chalaaya jayega
 The state government will run this campaign for 45 days
 in ahm rajyon ke alaava pashchim bengal, karnataka jaise kuch anya rajya bhi motor whical act ke khilaaf morcha khole hue hai
 The Trinamool Congress also opposed this law in Parliament and now the Mamta government has not implemented it in the state
 vahiin, bijepi shasit karnataka kii rajya sarkaar bhi badi hui jurmaana raashi se pareshaan najar aa rahi he or jald hi jurmaana raashi main katautee ke sanket die hai
 Let me tell you that if you talk about Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, he says that this fine has been imposed towards the Center not for earning but for the safety of the people
 agar kanoon kadaa hoga to log uskaa paalan karenge
 However, on the law being made by the state governments, Nitin Gadkari says that states have the right to make changes according to their own, but they have also appealed that no state government should come under political pressure And the law should be kept strict
 maharashtra main maratha samudaay ko aarakshan dene ke rajya sarkaar ke faisle par supreme court ne roak lagane se inkaar kar diya he
 The Supreme Court said that this reservation will not be applicable with retroactive effect
 haalanki antarim roak lagane ke liye notice bhi jari kiya he
 The case will be heard after 2 weeks
 aapako bataa den ki maharashtra main shiksha or sarkari naukariyon main maratha samudaay ko 16 fisadi aarakshan ko barkaraar rakhane vaale bombai hoicourt ke aadesh ke khilaaf ek enjio ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kii thi
 The petition states that the 50 percent cap on reservation set by the constitution bench has been violated
 pradhan nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi, nyaayamurti deepak gupta or nyaayamurti aniruddh bose kii peeth ne is mudde ko sunwaayee kii he
 Representative of NGO 'youth for Equality', Sanjeet Shukla has filed this petition
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki saamaajik evam shaikshanik rup se pichhadaa varg (esaibisi) aarakshan kanoon maratha samudaay ko shiksha or sarkari naukariyon main kramash: 12 se 13 pratishat aarakshan pradaan karata he
 This is a violation of the 50 percent reservation limit set by the apex court in the Indira Sawhney case, also known as the "mandal verdict"
 maharashtra sarkaar ne bhi hoicourt dwaara paarit faisle ko chunauti dene kii ummid karte hue yah kehete hue supreme court main ek pratwaad daayar kiya tha ki rajya kaa paksh sune bina ucch nyaayalay ke 27 june ke faisle ko chunauti dene vaali kisi bhi yachika par koi aadesh paarit nahin kiya jaae
 PDP President Mehbooba Mufti has given a big statement amidst the furore over the beef dispute
 jammu-kashmir kii satta par asin dal kii sirmaur ne kaha ki agar bhavanaaen aahat nahin ho rahi hai to log apane ghar ke andar chaahe jo bhi khaaen, is par kisi ko aapatti nahin honi chahie
 Mehbooba said, 'if the feelings of others are not hurting, then people have the right to eat anything inside their house
 kuch log kanoon ko apane haathon main lene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The PDP president said that people should consider the issue of what should be done for development
 kisi bhi tarah kii badmaashi hone par is ore desh main kadi karrwai honi chahie
 Significantly, in Jammu and Kashmir, there has been a lot of ruckus on the common roads ranging from beef corridors to beef
 hai court ne jahaan ek ore gomance kii bikri par roak laga di he, vahiin supreme court ne is aadesh ko do maheene ke liye nilambit kar diya he
 Leaders of power and opposition in the assembly have clashed several times on this issue, while the BJP, a partner of the PDD in the government, is adamant on seeking this direction

 a post shared by Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) on Mar 21, 2018 at 8:03 am PDT is film kaa badi besabri se intjaar ho rahaa he kyonki isamen shahrukh ke nae andaaj ke alaava shridevi ke chemiyo kii charchaa bhi chal rahi he
 Tamil superstar Rajinikanth, who decided to connect with people through 'spiritual politics' on New Year's Eve, is quietly revamping his fan club Rajni Makkal Mandram (RMM)
 makasad he tamilnadu kii har sadak or basti tak pahunchane ke apane vaadon ko puraa karne se pehle vyapak soshal media abhiyaan shuru karnaa
 Unlike the earlier cine actors who entered the state politics, the people of Rajinikanth Fan Club are already mobilizing enthusiastic supporters under the banner of RMM
 puri ummid he ki 2021 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main ve sabhi 234 vidhansabha kshetron se pratyaashee utaarenge
 Rajni is encouraging local groups to choose their own leader's council of representatives before the last political attack
 aaramem ke utsaahi kaaryakartaaon ne to rajya ke gramin or shahari chunaav kshetron main aadhe se zyada kaa khaakaa bhi taiyaar kar liya he
 Two months before the completion of the campaign, they have added around 21,00,000 new members
 jila parishadon main das sadasyeey samitiyaan pehle hi ban chuki hai or kareeb 65,000 shakha sachiv chhante ja chuke hai
 Each branch committee will have 30 members, who will handle 1-1 polling stations
 mukhya dravid partiyon—sattarudh annadramuk or uski virdohi dramuk—main netritv ke shunya ko mahasoos karte hue rajnikant or unke samarthakon ko ummid he ki ve aane vaale samay main party kaa aupchaarik elaan kiye jane tak in dalon ke samarthakon kii ek badi sankhya ko unase chhitaka paane main kaamyaab honge
 "people all over the state, especially women and youth, see this charismatic leader as the Chief Minister," says filmmaker Raju Mahalingam, who was made the state secretary of RMM
 ’’ unhen bharosa he ki ‘‘taliver tamil logon kii takadir badalane kaa aujaar sabit honge
 However, some analysts reject Rajinikanth's attitude
 unhen lagata he ki rajani apni ek film ke liye relies se pehle ek tarah kii guarantee chaahate hai
 Though the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh thinker S
 gurumurti ne superstar kii aadhyatmik raajnneeti ke brands kaa samarthan kiya he
 They believe that this can change the whole game, which is different from the Dravidian, anti-hindu line and is outdated
 gauratlab he ki tamilnadu main aaramem kii ranneeti—sanghathan nirmaan or booth stareey samitiyon kii niyukti—2014 or 2017 main bhaajapa ke uttar pradesh main safal abhiyaan kii nakal lagati he
 Rajinikanth, however, seems to take a dig at the notion that the BJP is behind him
 apni siyaasi aakanksha ujagar karne ke maheene bhar baad hi unhone camel or sarp ko baahar nikaalane ke liye aaramem ke chinh main sudhaar kiya
 His supporters say that his brand of 'spiritual politics' does not exclude non-hindus, it was an attempt to ensure that
 saaf he ki superstar rajnikant tamilnadu main jabardast raay banane vaale se siyaasi chunauti dene vaale ke apane safar main kisi tarah kaa roda nahin chaahate

 Economic development in a progressive country like India requires foreign investment in addition to existing resources
 aise main bharti airtel ke chairman sunil mittal ne india today se khaas baatcheet main kaha he ki videshi niveshak sthirataa khojate hai or chunavi saal main agar desh main asthir sarkaar banati he to nivesh aane main mushkil ho sakati he
 In a special conversation with India today-aaj Tak news director Rahul Kanwal at the ongoing World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal said, "definitely foreign investors seek stability and if they will find If there is a loose system in the government then people can put a brake on investment
 ' unhone kaha ki kisi bhi raashtra ke liye sthirataa jaruri he or vishesh taur par bharat jaise vividh raashtra ke liye sthirataa or bhi jaruri he
 However, it is difficult to tell how the situation will be in the case of a coalition government

 rahul gandhi ke bayaan par kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi jis tarah kii raajnneeti ghrinaa or nafrat failaane kii desh main karte he, waisi hi raajnneeti desh ke baahar bhi jaakar karte hai
 Political differences should not be seen outside the country
 party ko apni baat rakhni chahie, lekin desh ke bheetar party kii baat rakhana unka adhikaar he
 It is right to criticize, but such things should not be done outside the country
 ravishankar prasad kaa kahana he ki dilli main ek tarafpravasi bharatiyonka sammelan chal rahaa he or pradhanmantri bharat ke saath duniya ke sambandh kaise achche ho, is par baat kar rahe hai, lekin duusari taraf rahul gandhi ghrinaa, nafrat kii baat karte hai
 Rahul's statement is condemnable, worthy of criticism
 ghrinaa-nafrat ke liye hamaari sarkaar par aarope lagaana thik nahin he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad asked Rahul Gandhi that whether the Congress stand on triple talaq was loving or hateful, it should be clear to them
 nari garima nyaay ko lekar congress party rahul gandhi ek stand nahin le sakate
 He took a stand in the Lok Sabha, took a second stand in the Rajya Sabha and Rahul Gandhi is teaching our party a lesson
 yah thik nahin he
 This is the double standard of the Congress
 raajnneetik vot bank se prabhavit hai
 We are teaching you in Bahrain
 rahul ke is bayaan kii kadi aalochana BJP karti he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad says that Rahul Gandhi has said wrong things many times before
 rahul gandhi ne congress negujarat membhi jatvaad ko badhaava dene kii raajnneeti kii he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad says that Congress has always done community politics
 congress ne shahbaano se shaayara bano tak congress kaa tushtikaran kaa ravaiya nahin badla he
 Who is doing the politics of hate, it becomes clear
 china par rahul ke bayaan kaa bhi ravishankar prasad ne ninda karte hue kaha ki china par rahul gandhi ke pyaar bhi rochak sawaal khadey karata he
 On the National Anthem, Ravi Shankar Prasad says that there is no question of the government's retreat in this matter
 court kaa faisla he, divyangon or varisht nagarikon kii dikkat kaa sawaal aayaa tha
 There is a committee of the government, the Home Ministry will look after its report
 tivi sho 'silsilaa badalte rishton kaa' ke band hone ko lekar tarah-tarah ke kayaas lagaae jate rahe hai

 According to the news, the show will be replaced by the serial set to be launched soon on Colors
 spotboy ne apni report main likhaa, "ye,silsilabadalte rishton kaa band hone ja rahaa he
 The show's cast and crew are working towards its end and the show will be closed by the end of November
 "report main yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki channel par tantra dharawarik ke promo shuru kar die gaye hai or yahi sho silsilaa ko riples karegaa
 In such a situation, the confusing love story of Kunal, Nandini and Maululi will soon start moving towards its end
 maaloom ho ki sho main actress drushti dhami nandini kaa kirdaar nibhaati hai jo ki is sho kii lead hai
 However, it is also worth noting that no official announcement has been made by the makers regarding the closure of the show
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki silsilaa ke mekars kab tak is sho ko band kiye jane kii ghoshnaa karte hai

 In such a situation, if you are thinking about buying a new AC, then Gum is here to tell you some important tips that can help you in choosing the right AC
 -sabase pehali baat jo aapako dhyaan rakhni he wo ye he ki aap behatar energy eficiant AC khariden
 The higher the AC rating, the more it will save electricity
 kyonki aap jaanate hi honge ki asi lagane se bijli kaa bill kaaphi zyada aata he
 acs typically come with ratings ranging from 1 star to 5 stars
 yani 5 star reating vaala asi 3 star vaale se behatar hoga
 However, it is important to keep in mind that if you want to use AC only for 6-7 hours, that too for only 3-4 months, then AC with 3 star rating can prove to be beneficial
 -iske alaava bijli bachaane ke liye aap inwarter asi ko bhi select kar sakate hai
 This saves electricity much better
 yani ise aap aise samaj sakate hai ki 3-star inwarter asi 5-star vaale regular asi kii tulana main kam power kanjum karata he
 But keep in mind that inverter acs are more expensive than regular acs
 -iske baad jo cheez aapako dhyaan main rakhni he wo he asi kaa sies
 If your room is in 100 to 120 square feet, then 1 ton AC is sufficient for you
 vahiin 175 squaire feet vaale kamare ke liye aapako 1
 5 tons of AC will be required
 isi tarah AC kaa chunaav karen
 Taking AC of the right size will also save your electricity
 -AC kharidne ke vakt aapako coiles kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga
 acs usually come with two coils - copper and aluminum
 copper coiles vaale asi thode mahange jarur aate hai lekin ye aluminium kii tulana main quality ke str par behatar hote hai
 Similarly, when buying AC, you must also ask about the efficiency of AC for extreme heat or when the sunlight is directly on the AC
 kyonki acchhee quality vaale asi extream hit main bhi behatar parform karte hai to vahiin lower quality vaale asi kharaab parform karne ke saath hi zyada power kanjum bhi karte hai
 Apart from all this, it is also important to keep in mind that AC does not produce any more noise
 split asi vaise aamtaur par kam yaa naa ke baraabar nois paidaa karte hai to vahiin windo asi main nois kii dikkat zyada rahati he
 This can spoil your sleep
 aise main apane AC dealer se indoor or outdoor unite ke nois detail ke bare main jarur puuchhen ye db main hota he
 Also, keep in mind the place where AC is installed
 -agar aap AC ko thanda karne se bhi kahin zyada, extra feechar vaala chaahate hai to aajkal market main air purifaire, anti bacterial, aandar removal filter or vaai-faai saport vaale asi bhi aate hai
 Although they cost a little more
 -sabase ant main jo baat aapako dhyaan rakhni he wo ye he ki aapako after cell sarvice kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana he
 acs come with a lot of technology
 aise main apane dealer se servicing sambandhi sari jaankariyaan jarur len

 Many times more than Dhoni, the Federer had deposited nearly six crore 61 lakh in his account by winning the sixth Wimbledon title last week, while Dhoni, the highest grosser in the world of cricket, got six crore rupees after playing in the Indian Premier League for a month and a half
 Huh
 federer ke naam par ab sabase adhik grandslam hi nahin balki sarvaadhik puraskaar raashi hasil karne kaa ricard bhi he
 Wimbledon's victory has earned his career earnings of 42 million 94 thousand 75 thousand 219 dollars (about two billion, 23 crore 47 lakh rupees) and he needs about two crore 52 lakh rupees to touch the magic figure of 50 million and the whole possibility Is that by the end of this year he will earn so much more
 federer ke baad peet sampraas kaa numberis swiss khilaadi ke baad peet sampraas kaa number aata he jinhen federer ne kamai ke maamle main pichley agast main hi peeche choda tha
 Sampras earned four crores, 32 lakhs, 80 thousand dollars (about two billion eight crores and 86 lakhs rupees) in his career, while Federer's arch rival Rafael Nadal has so far collected one billion 21 crores 26 lakh rupees from tennis only in his account
 Have it written vigyaapan kii kamai shaamil nahinfaderer kii is kamai main vigyaapan, praayojan or anya jariyon se kii gayi kamai shaamil nahin hai
 They also get crores of rupees from sponsorship, while they are also in great demand in the advertising world
 sirf tennis se kamai kaa zikr kiya jaae to federer is saal ab tak 48 lakh, 81 hajaar 261 dollars(lagbhag 23 karod, 53 lakh 39 hajaar rupee)kama chuke hai jabaki abhi america open or kai anya toornament hone baaki hai
 He not only removed Nadal from the number one ranking by winning Wimbledon but also left him behind in this year's earnings
 nadal chot ke kaaran wimbledon main nahin khel paye the
 Even if the dwarfederer's earnings are compared to Indian cricketers in Dhoni and Tendulkar's earnings, Dhoni or Tendulkar only earns nine to ten crore rupees a year from cricket (about six crores from IPL and about three crores from BCCI) whereas In 2007, Federer earned Rs 48
81 million from tennis only

 The core team of four big party leaders has camped in Gujarat
 koun hai kejariwal kii is kor team main ?arvind kejariwal kii is kor team main party ke bade netaa sanjay singh hai jo kejariwal ko kareebi hai or punjab chunaav main ahm bhoomika nibhaa chuke hai
 At the same time, the other leader is Ashutosh who was in the main role in the Goa assembly elections along with Delhi
 team ke tisare netaa hai ashish khetaan jo purv khoji patrkaar or party kii dilli sarkaar main dilli dialog kamishan ke mukhiya hai
 Khaitan had prepared the party's manifesto in Punjab and Delhi and Durgesh Pathak is the fourth leader of this core team who played a very important role for the party in Punjab elections along with Delhi elections
 durgesh pathak party kii rashtriya sanghathan incharge bhi hai
 What will aap's core team do in Gujarat? Kejriwal's most trusted core team has been given significant responsibility in Gujarat elections
 chaaron netagujaratko chaar jone main baant kar ek-ek jone kii jimmedaari sambhalange, jahaan party ke sanghathan ko khadaa karne se lekar booth str tak kaaryakartaaon ke saath samanvay banaakar disambar main hone vaale gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon main puri takat jhonkenge

 lekin sutron ke mutabit punjab ke nattejey aane ke baad in netaaon kii phul time duty gujarat main hogi
 These party leaders will remain in Gujarat till the end of elections
 vahiin aam aadmi party ne dilli sarkaar main mantri gopal raay ko gujarat main sanghathan banane kii jimmedaari di he

 sutron kii maane to party ke sabhi bade netaa or mantri punjab ke nateezon ke baad gujarat main samay denge, lekin tamaam yojanaenpunjab vidhansabhachunaav ke nateezon par bhi nirbhar hai
 If the public opinion in Punjab is in favor of the Aam Aadmi Party, then obviously the morale of the party will increase and in Gujarat they can get the benefit of it, but if AAP is not successful in Punjab, then Kejriwal's dreams in Gujarat are also a big blow May take

 South Superstar Rajinikanth received the Icon of Golden Jubilee Award for his contribution to Indian cinema
 vahiin french actress Isabelle Huppert ko lifetime achievement aword se sammanit kiya gaya
 Explain that there are plans to screen 26 feature films and 15 non-feature films at the festival this time
 festival ke dauraan amitabh bachchan kii bhi kai sari filmon kii screening kii ja rahi he
 On this Amitabh said- We have no words to express our gratitude
 bataa den ki isi dauraan amitabh bachchan ko dada sahib phalke sammaan se bhi nawaja gaya
 On completing 50 years in the film industry, Amitabh said- 50 years of my film journey have been completed
 saal 1969 se maine filmon main kaam karnaa shuru kiya tha or IFFI kaa bhi ye 50waan adishan chal rahaa he
 i thank the government for organizing this
 mujhe saaf-saaf yaad he ki jab bachapan main main aazaadee ke andolan ke bare main padhaa karata tha, to khud ko badakismat mahasoos karata tha
 i used to wonder why i was not born during the freedom movement
 meri paidaaish ek bahut alahada kism kii duniya main hui
 i knew that i am untouchable
 or apane bare main yah baat bhuulane kii jaddojahad main laga rahata
 i would have ignored it
 main ise badalane kii koshish karata, sochataa, shaayad naam badalane se yah badal jaaegi
 But people kept reminding me constantly
 yaad dilaate rahete ki main achhut hum, kai tareekon se
 Then i realized that the freedom we have gained is merely political independence
 iske alaava bhi kai or nijee aazaadiyaan hai jinaki khatir hamen laduya hoga
 i realized that something is missing in the legacy of freedom movement
 vah he auraton, daliton or adivaasiyon kii viraasat
 They too fought for independence, but their efforts were not recorded
 aaj ham un sabaki numaaindgi karte hai
 The practice of manual scavenging was undoubtedly present throughout this period
 yah hindustan ke kai hukmaranon kii gaddi ke neeche jari rahi
 It continued even after independence
 yah aaj bhi maujuud he
 It cannot be freedom
 iskaa khaatmaa hona hi chahie
 Generally, there are two types of voices and arguments that people pursue with vigor in women cleaning workers doing manual scavenging
 unamem se ek yah he ki ''didi aap itnaa acha kaam karti ho, aap nahin karengi to or koun karegaa?'' yah unhen mahima mandit karnaa he
 This is what Mahatma Gandhi did and which Narendra Modi wants to uphold
 jarurat ise band karne kii he
 The second is, "sister, we understand that you should not do this work, but if you don't do it, how will you live?" This is how you live
 '' yah berahami he
 We have made a package deal for his birth and gujar-basar
 magar yah hakeekat he jise log apni dhoortta se todate-marodate or sir par mailaa dhone waalon ke saamne rakhte hai
 Their ways are, "sister, if you don't, who will do the cleaning for me?" This is a very well planned trick
 dikkat yah he ki jo chijen hamen bandhak banaae rakhti hai, unhen ham na to pahchaan rahe hai or na hi sweekaar kar rahe hai
 It is not just about freedom of Dalits or untouchables
 agar aap sochate hai ki main aapse nichle darje kaa hum, to aap gulam hai
 Caste is one of the biggest diseases
 pitrusattatmak vyavastha doosraa virus he jise ham kabhi sweekaar nahin karte
 Babasaheb Ambedkar took two very important steps in this matter
 pehla samvidhan kaa anuchhed 17 he, jo chuaachhut ko gaiyr-kanoonee tehraata he
 But for this we needed practical intervention
 doosraa he hindu code bill
 He had to resign because it was not approved
 aaj ambedkar ko bada pratik bana diya gaya he
 The Prime Minister says that he too is an Ambedkar devotee
 magar ambedkar kaa vijan kya tha? aap use amal main laana kyon shuru nahin karte? jativaadee dimag ek virus he jisase takaraane kii himmat kisi sarkaar ke paas nahin he
 The same is the case with patriarchy
 15 agast par hamaara makasad in bimariyon kaa jad se safaya karnaa hona chahie
