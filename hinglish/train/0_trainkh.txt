 jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hatane ke baad ab vahaan par samanta kii baat kii ja rahi he
 There are many communities in the valley that were waiting for the 370 to end
 kyonki kareeb saat dashakon se unhen rajya main maujuud anya samudaayon kii tarah samaan adhikaar nahin mili the
 Prominent among them is the Valmiki community of the Dalit class
 is samudaay ko vibhinn rajyon main chuhadaa, bhangi, mehtar jaise naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The people of this community, who consider the sage Valmiki, the author of the Ramayana, do a disgusting act of scavenging
 kyonki inhen kisi or jagah kaam yaa naukari nahin di jaati
 These people have not even got citizenship of the valley for 6 decades
 jabaki isaki shuruyaat achche jivan ke vaade se shuru hui thi
 But that promise has not been fulfilled yet
 ab is samudaay ke logon ko ummid he ki unhen samaan adhikaar, nae maukey, nayaa rojgaar aadi milegaa
 The people of Valmiki community have been making Jammu and Kashmir a paradise for decades
 jammu-kashmir main safai karmi hadtaal par chale gaye
 The strike went on for months
 jammu or srinagar main kachare or gandagi kaa ambara lag gaya
 Troubled by this, senior Jammu and Kashmir leader Sheikh Abdullah, Chief Minister Bakshi Ghulam Muhammad and his cabinet decided in 1957 to bring sweepers from other states
 sabase najadik punjab kaa gurudaspur or amritsar jila tha
 Hence 272 sweepers were called from there
 inase vaada kiya gaya tha ki inhen or inke pariwaron ko achche vetan ke alaava rajya kii naagarikta or saare adhikaar milenge
 All of them were settled in the Jammu division
 jammu kashmir rajya main un sabhi valmiki samudaay ke logon ko basaane ke saath hi unke saath sanvaidhanik chal kiya gaya
 The population of people of Valmiki community who reached the valley in the number of 272 has increased to thousands today but they have not got citizenship of Jammu and Kashmir till date
 puure desh main valmiki samudaay or anya daliton ko vibhinn kanoonon ke tahat anek prakaar ke adhikaar mili hue hai
 But till now people of this community living in Jammu and Kashmir did not have any provision of any such law
 lekin anuchhed 370 hatane ke baad ab ummid jaagi he ki inhen ab sammaan vaali jindagi milegi
 Under Article 35-A, the government used to decide who would be a permanent resident, Article 35-A gave the State of Jammu and Kashmir the right to decide who would be a permanent resident in the state
 jammu-kashmir rajya ko jab yah adhikaar diya gaya tab tak rajya kaa samvidhan bhi nahin bana tha
 Later, after the constitution of the state was made, it was written that the status of permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir will be given to those who have been living in the state since 1944 or earlier
 lekin valmiki samaaj ke log 1957 main punjab se laakar basaae gaye the isliye ajtak unhen jammu-kashmir kaa sthai nivasee nahin mana gaya or unhen sthai nivas pramaan patr nahin diya gaya
 Changing the rules added the provision of always being a sweeper, the Jammu and Kashmir government changed the rules to give employment to the people of the Valmiki community, writing that they will always remain only sweepers
 inhen asthai rup se rahane kaa adhikaar or naukari di jaaegi
 When a child of this community is born, it has to grow up and become a cleaning worker, no matter how much he studies
 yahi nahin sthai pramaan patr na hone kii vajah se valmiki samaaj ke log sampatti bhi nahin kharid sakate the
 Their children also do not get state government scholarship
 valmiki samudaay ke bacchon ko rajya sarkaar ke ejineering, medical yaa kisi anya technical course ke collejon main admician nahin miltaa tha
 People of Valmiki community can exercise franchise in Lok Sabha elections but cannot vote in assembly elections

 dilli main darjanon parshadon ne tapati dhoop main kaam karne vaale safai karmchaariyon ke liye banaae gaye rest room ko apana personal daftar bana liya he
 When the team of 'aaj Tak' investigated, it came to know that there are not one or two dozen councilors who have occupied government space and made their offices
 isamen bijepi se lekar aam aadmi party donon shaamil hai
 At the same time, the current councilors are included as well as the former mayor
 dilli ke safai karne ke liye tainaat safai karmchaariyon ko die gaye shelter home main nigam parshadon ne apane daftar bana liye hai
 Even though BJP holds the MCD, people of all parties are involved in occupying the government space and building their office
 bataa den ki nagar nigam ne apane safai karmchaariyon ke rest room ke taur par uplabdh karaae hai
 That is, after work all day, this is the work of their stay and their attendance etc
 purvi dilli ke kishan kunj ward main hi bane safai karmchaariyon ke rest room main parshad himanshi pandey ne daftar bana liya he
 In addition, it has also arranged all the facilities inside it
 do bade-bade board laga die hai or saath hi milane kaa vakt bhi likh diya he
 However, when Aaj Tak spoke to Himanshi Pandey in this matter, he denied that there was anything wrong in it
 himanshi ne kaha ki ham janata kii seva kar rahe hai
 He said, 'this place i do not use for my personal work
 main janata kaa hi kaam karti hum
 i have not taken the whole space, taken a little space
 jo netaa aarope laga rahe hai jaraa unke bare main pataa kar lijie unhone kitni jameen kabja kii hui he
 At the same time, the rest room of the cleaning staff near the Pandav Nagar police station has been made its office by Municipal Councilor Bhavna Malik of Mayur Vihar
 mayur vihaar-2 kii nigam parshad bhaavana malik ne bhi rest room ko apana daftar bana diya or bade-bade board laga die hai
 Several cleaning workers were sitting nearby although he was avoiding to speak directly but he admitted that it is his office which was made by the BJP councilor
 daftar kabja karne main aam aadmi party ke parshad bhi peeche nahin he east vinod nagar se aam aadmi party ke parshad gita ravat ne ambedkar park ke andar bane horticulture vibhaag ke daftar ko apana daftar bana liya he
 Geeta Rawat's board is also installed here
 haalanki gita is baat ko galat nahin maanati
 He says, 'the place where my office is is from the Horticulture Department
 aap pataa kar lijie keval 6 log hai usamen se do chuttee par rahete hai chaar log hai unke baithne ke liye vahaan par bahut jagah he
 On the contrary, the tea water there is all with my money
 kisi se bhi puch lijie koi bhi pareshaan nahin he sab khush hai
 However, some councilors came on the backfoot in view of the protest of the cleaners and seeing this happening in the media
 purvi dilli kii nigam parshad or meyar rahi nima bhagat ne daftar kii chaabi safai karmchaariyon ko dene kii baat kii he
 Nima Bhagat has made the office of the cleaning staff his own office, and has kept all the facilities from the fridge to the water cooler
 bataa den ki safai karmchaaree union ne beete dinon yahaan par pradarshan kiya tha
 Union state president Sanjay Gehlot said that this is a fraud with the security staff
 itani tapati dhoop main unako kahin rukne kii jagah nahin he
 Some workers have stayed in the bus stop, some under the tree
 unke daftar kii maang puraani he or jab daftar mili to us par parshadon ne kabja kar liya
 East Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Vipin Bihari Mishra said, 'this is very wrong
 abhi- abhi yah baat meri sangyaan main ai he
 i will immediately speak to all these councilors to free up space
 agar vah aisa nahin karenge to un par karrwai bhi hogi
 But not only BJP but councilors of all parties did so
 ' Film Name: Fuludirector: Abhishek saxenastar Cast: Sharib Ali Hashmi, Jyoti Sethi, Inamul Haque, Nutan Surya Duration: 1 hour 36 minutes Certificate: a Rating: 3 Star India is considered an agricultural country and is still called a developing country, here Even today the population of the village is more than the city and on one hand the men of the village go to the nearby city and try to do the work, even today the thinking of society and some other conservative Security is also present
 nirdeshak abhishek saxena ne gramin mahilaon kii har samasya kii taraf dhyaan aakarshith karne ke liye is film kaa nirmaan kiya he jisamen kuch saal pehle ai hui film 'filmistan' ke actor shaarib ali hashmi ko liya gaya he
 Just on this issue, actor Akshay Kumar has also made a film called 'padman' which will be released in the coming months but to highlight the same days of his first month, the makers of 'fulu' film have made this film
 After all, how is the film made? Let's review the film
 kahaneeyah kahani gaanv ke rahane vaale phullu(shaarib ali hashmi) kii he jo apni maa or bahan ke saath gaanv main rahata he
 Fulu has a specialty that whenever he goes to the city for every woman living in the village, he definitely brings with him the items he needs, Fulu is useless and does not do any work left, seeing that his mother got him married by Bigni (jyoti) Sethi), but even after marriage, there is no change in the activities of Fulu, he goes to the city as usual but once he visits the medical store When Kutter understands about the menstrual pads of the women from Sahiba, he realizes that the women living in his house i
e
 mother's sister and wife as well as the women of his village are also available with less money
 needed
 kisi karanvash phullu shahar ja kar ke pad bananaa sikhta he lekin jab yah sikh kar waapas gaanv aata he to uske gharavaale hi uski in baton se khush nahin rahete haalanki phullu kii bivi ko yakeen rahata he ki uskaa pati ek naa ek din apane mansoobey main kaamyaab hoga, kahani main twist turn aate hai or aakhirkaar isko anjaam miltaa he jise jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Know why you can watch the film, the story of the film is quite interesting, which directs towards the period of the month of women and gives a big message to use the pads used during it
 film main yah kahani to ek gaanv main besd he lekin is kahani se har ek tarah kaa tabaka conect kar saktaa he or sabase zyada gramin mahilaayein or purush pradhan gharon ke purush bhi jarur conect karenge
 The film has very good directions as well as the real location makes the film even more rich, some of the good locations of the village and everyday life work make it even more real
 filmistan naamak film se logon ke dilon main ghar kar gaye actor shaarib ali hashmi ne bahut badhiya kaam kiya he jo ki aapako sochane par vivash bhi kara detaa he vahi abhinetri jyoti sethi kaa kaam acha he nutan surya ne bhi badhiya kaam kiya he vahi chote se role main abhinayta inamul haq ne cheri on da top kaa kaam kiya he baaki sabhi kirdaaron kaa kaam bhi acha he
 The music of the film is good and the music related to the ground reality is also used in the background, the songs sung in the village are threaded with screen play and the song 'bhunar-bhunar' is quite good

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne gujarat ke chaaron ahm hisson ko pata to rajya main party ke santhnik dhaanche ke liye sanjivani kii tarah kaam kiya
 Not only did the party workers get excited, but they also hoped that if hard work can be done then it can be possible which has not been done in Gujarat in last 22 years
 yani bijepi ko patkhni de congress kii gujarat kii satta main vaapasi
 But will it really happen? Rahul campaigned with Navsarjan Yatra, which prepared the land, now Congress does not want to let the Advantage go by hand
 rahul ne gujarat main lagbhag 2500 kilometre kii duuri tay kar logon se sampark saadhaa
 Now remember the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections held earlier this year
 us chunaav main rahul ne kisaan yatra nikaali thi jisamen ‘khaat sabhaaon’ kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 But all that settlement was made to Prashant Kishore through outsourcing
 vahiin, ab gujarat chunaav main party kisi outsidar kii jagah khud ke aantarik sansadhano par hi bharosa kar rahi he
 All strategies are being made without the help of any private company
 navasarjan gujarat ke theme ke saath navasarjan yatra ko congress ‘inhouse project’’ bataa rahi he
 Senior Congress leader Arjun Modwadia told 'aaj Tak', 'we have not consulted any professional nor supported any private company
 rahul gandhi kii navasarjan yatra kii ruparekha hamaare netaaon ne banaai or hamaare kaaryakartaaon ne ise hakeekat main tabdeel kiya
 'it is difficult to say how much the party's Navsarjan Gujarat campaign and Rahul Gandhi's Navsarjan Yatra will get in the election, but it is so sure that the BJP was forced to change its election strategy
 gujarat pichley 22 saal se bijepi kaa garh bana hua he
 During this, 5 assembly elections were held and BJP defeated Congress in all
 ye baat jarur he ki gujarat main pichley teen vidhansabha chunaav bijepi ne narendra modi ko mukhyamantri ke chehre ke taur par pesh karte hue jite
 But this time it is not so
 modi ab pradhanmantri hai lekin gujarat unka grih rajya hone kii vajah se unki khud kii saakh kaa bhi sawaal he
 Modi is going to conduct more than 30 election rallies from November 18, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself in charge of campaigning
 navasarjan yatra ke dauraan gujarat ko chaar jone main baant kar rahul ne har jone kaa 3-3 din kaa daura kiya
 For this, sitting in the blue bus, Rahul met the business class, women, youth, laborers, farmers, tribals and addressed the street corner meetings
 is dauraan rahul ne soft hindutv kii line ko bhi majbootee se pakade rakhaa or har us prasiddh mandir main darshan ke liye pahunche jo unki yatra ke raste main padaa
 Not only this, while going to the dhabas, they also ate Gujarati food with great fervor
 or kuch hua ho yaa naa hua ho, navasarjan yatra se gujarat ke logon se sidhaa sampark banane main jarur safal hue
 To some extent, he also managed to break his image that was created by opponents on social media
 congress ke mahila wing kii adhyaksh sushmita dev kaa kahana he ki is safal yatra ne gujarat ke logon se asalirahul gandhiki pahchaan karai he or yahi baat he jo bijepi ko hairaan-pareshaan kar rahi he
 Sushmita Dev said, 'navsarjan Yatra, where Rahul Gandhi has been brought closer to the people, the same Prime Minister Modi still maintains a distant relationship with the people, a relationship that is formed through radio, TV and Twitter
 ’rahul kii navasarjan yatra ke baad ab congress kaa jor ‘door tu door’ campagne ke jariye matadaataaon se sampark saadhane par he
 The four frontal organizations of the Congress- Women's Wing, Youth Congress, NSUI and Seva Dal are doing their best
 gujarat congress ke netaa nitish vyas kaa kahana he ki hamaare frontal sanghathanon ke saath-saath varisht netaaon, district or block level ke netaaon ne jis tarah navasarjan yatra ko ekajute hokar safal banaaya he, waisi hi jor party ko is chunaav main jitaane par he

 Now they are going to prepare for Rock On
 'rockon-2' kii heroin banakar shraddha kapur kaa 8 saal purana ek sapana puraa ho gaya he
 'rockon' was released in 2008 and then Shraddha Kapur dreamed of working in the sequel of this film, which has been completed
 tippaniyan The film 'rockon-2' is a sequel to the 2008 musical hit rockon, starring Shraddha Kapoor with Farhan Akhtar and Arjun Rampal in the lead
 'rockon-2' ke ek pramotional event par shraddha is film se judane par khushi zaahir karte hue kaha ki "jab maine pehali 'rockon' dekhi thi tabhi maine ek khwab dekha tha ki main iske sikval main kaam karuungi
 Today my dream has been fulfilled
 khushkismat hum ki maine jo sapana dekha tha vah sach main puraa ho gaya or main 'rockon-2' kaa hissaa hum
 Shraddha Kapoor's film journey began in 2010 with the film Teen Patti and rockon was released in 2008
 yani filmon main aane se pehle hi shraddha ne sikval main aane kaa sapana dekh liya tha
 If this is true then there is indeed a beautiful coincidence, which can probably be accomplished only in films and film world
 film 'rockon-2' sikval he 2008 ki musical hit film 'rockon' kaa, jisamen shraddha kapur ke saath farhaan akhtar or arjuna rampal mukhya bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 Shraddha was delighted to be associated with the film at a promotional event on rockon-2, saying that "when i first saw 'rockon', i saw a dream that i would work in the sequel
 aaj meraa sapana puraa ho chukaa he
 Luckily, the dream i dreamed of came true and i am part of 'rockon-2'
 shraddha kapur kaa filmi safar 2010 main film 'teen pattee' se shuru hua tha or 'rockon' 2008 main release hui thi
 That is, Shraddha had dreamed of coming to the sequel before coming to films
 agar yah baat sach he to vaaki ek haseen ittefaaq he, jo shaayad filmon or filmi duniya main hi puraa ho saktaa he
 Shraddha Kapoor's film journey began in 2010 with the film Teen Patti and rockon was released in 2008
 yani filmon main aane se pehle hi shraddha ne sikval main aane kaa sapana dekh liya tha
 If this is true then there is indeed a beautiful coincidence, which can probably be accomplished only in films and film world
 jammu- kashmir se kashmiri panditon ke visthaapan ko 29 saal kaa vakt guzar chukaa he, lekin sarkaar ke paas aankada tak nahin he ki aakhir kitne kashmiri panditon ko is dauraan apni jaan ganvaani padi thi
 The process of displacement of Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley started in January 1990 and the Pandits who were banished from there could never go back to their homes
 is mudde par desh kii siyasat khub garam hui, lekin aaj tak kisi bhi sarkaar ne kashmiri panditon kii ghati main vaapasi ke liye thos kadam nahin uthaae
 More than 3 lakh Kashmir Pandits were forcibly evicted from Kashmir about 30 years ago
 is dauraan saikadon mandir tabah kar die gaye, lekin is maamle kii na to koi SIT jaanch hui or na hi kisi ayog kaa gathan kiya gaya
 The Kashmiri Pandits, citizens of a democratic country, were forced to leave their own homes and flee
 us daur main algaavvaadi or aatanki rajya main alpsankhyak kashmiri panditon ko ghati se bhagane ke liye amada the
 Hundreds of people in the community lost their lives, even threatening posters were pasted on the doors of the pundits
 akhabaaron main dhamkaane vaale ishtehaar chapa karte the
 The persecution is over, the wounds are not filled
 
 
 un dinon ghati main sab taraf hindu virdohi naare gunja karte the
 The speakers in the mosques also became a means of intimidating and threatening the Pandits
 saal 1990 kii 19-20 janvari ko kashmiri panditon ko ghati se bedakhal karne kaa silsilaa shuru hua or maheene bhar main 3 lakh pandit kashmir chhodkar desh ke alag-alag hisson main basane ko majaboor ho gaye
 Even today, displaced people go to Sihar, expressing their pain
 kashmiri panditon par julm kii kahani bhale hi khatm ho gai ho, lekin jakhm kaa dard ab bhi haraa hi he
 Despite this, our government does not know who had lost their lives during this period to Kashmiri Pandits
 india today samvaadadaata ashok upaadhyaay ne is maamle main soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat grih mantralay main ek RTI daayar kii, jisamen poocha gaya ki is dauraan aatankiyon ne kitne kashmiri panditon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya or in maamalon main ab tak kya-kya progress hui he
 But the Home Ministry's reply was shocking
 RTI par grih mantralay kaa javabmantralay kii ore se india today kii RTI ke jawaab main kaha gaya ki use is bare main koi bhi jaankaree nahin he
 Simultaneously, it was said in the reply that information for this should be sought from the Government of Jammu and Kashmir because the RTI Act, enacted in the year 2005, would apply only in the state
 ab grih mantralay ke is jawaab ne kashmir main nae siyaasi vivaad ko janm de diya he
 Reacting to this, Jammu and Kashmir Congress President Ravindra Sharma said that it shows the negligence of the BJP government that they have not yet collected data
 unke paas ab tak kashmiri panditon kii maut or aatankiyon ke khilaaf darj kiye gaye maamalon kii koi jaankaree nahin he
 On this, BJP state president Ravindra Raina says that this shows the negligence of the Home Ministry officials, while hundreds of Kashmiri Pandits were massacred in the valley during that time
 unhone kaha ki is maamle ke liye jaanch ayog gathit hona chahie
 Raina also said that the Congress had no right to speak in it because when all this was happening, the Congress was just a mute spectator
 sawaal yah he ki sarkaar ne ab tak kashmiri panditon kii hatya kii jaanch ke liye ayog kaa gathan kyon nahin kiya? kya panditon ko nyaay dilaanaa sarkaar kii praathamikta nahin he yaa phir ve ab raajnneetik dalon ke liye vot bank kaa jariya nahin rah gaye hai? vajah kuch bhi ho lekin itnaa saaf he ki sabhi sarkarein kashmir panditon ko nyaay dilaane main ab tak vifal hi sabit hui hai

 desh kii rajdhani main subjiyon kaa vyapaar karne vaali do badi mandiyon main pichley 15 dinon se tamaato ke daam main jabardast oochaal dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Aaj Tak has visited the Ghazipur mandi and tried to know what is the reason behind the skyrocketing price of tomatoes
 mandi main kisaanon se tamaato kharidne vaale vyapaariyon or hadataaliyon kaa maananaa he ki agast ke maheene tak mahange tamaato se chhutkaaraa milanaa mushkil he
 The retail price in Mandi is fixed at Rs 65 to 70 per kg
 jabaki dilli kii galiyon, sosayadi or chote bazaaron main yah tamaato 80 se 100 rupee prati kilo tak bik rahaa he
 Let us tell you that the wholesale rate of tomatoes in Ghazipur market for the last 3 days - on July 24, wholesale tomatoes sold from 50 to 60 rupees per kg
 -25 july ko daam 10 rupee tak gire or thok tamaato 50 rupee kilo tak bika
 - On July 26, prices rose again and wholesale tomatoes sold from 50 to 62 rupees per kg
 gajipur mandi main subjiyon kaa vyapaar karne vaale jagadish ne 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main bataaya ki barsaat kii vajah se tamaato kaa paudha kharaab ho rahaa he
 Only in Himachal, tomato is grown on the mountain, so the crop is coming from there
 jagadish ke mutabik 10 dinon takatmatar ke damame tezi dekhne ko mil sakati he, kyonki maharashtra or bangaleru se dilli kii mandiyon tak tamaato pahunch nahin paa rahaa he
 He also informed that as tomato prices rise, tomatoes are being purchased less in hotels and restaurants
 jo log pehle das carat tamaato karidate the ab wo ek carat tamaato se kaam chalaa rahe hai
 Usman, who has been doing setmaterka business in Ghazipur mandi for the last ten years, said that due to high tomato prices in Bangalore, trucks are not coming to Delhi
 kisaan kaa 60 se 65 rupee prati kilo daam vaala tamaato kharidkar mandi ke aadti 70 se 75 rupee prati kilo ke daam main tamaato bechate hai
 The same tomato retail reaches 100 rupees per kg
 osman ke mutabik mandi main sirf 50 pratishat tamaato aa rahaa he jabaki kharidari 100 fisadi ho rahi he
 Also, there is no possibility of a fall in tomato prices due to only Shimla tomatoes coming to the market
 thok vikritaon kii maane to tamaato ke daamon main abhi tezi bani rahegi
 There is absolutely no chance of tomatoes being cheap before August 15
 matlab saaf he ki mahangaa tamaato na keval aapke khaane kaa jaayaka bigadega, balki aapaki jeb par bhi baari padegaa

 Ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made the cleanliness campaign his important mission, many celebrities, including BJP leaders, have gone out to photograph and take a broom
 ham dekh rahe hai, photo to khinch rahi he lekin, mul kaam safai or jaagarukta nahin fail rahi he

 There are residents of Jagatpur, a village in outer Delhi
 pataa chalaa ki jagatpur gaanv main dengue or malaria ke bahut saare maamle hai
 When this village arrived, a man was spraying medicine in the drains with 10 to 12 people
 
 Was cleaning drains and advising people to avoid dengue
 
 
 maine samajha ki shaayad koi netaa yaa nigam karmchaaree hoga
 i have never met or talked to him
 unhen pataa hi nahin tha ki rashtriya media kaa koi shaksh is gaanv aayaa he
 i asked, are you the leader, he said no
 mujhe netagiri main koi dilchaspee nahin he
 So you will definitely be a supporter of Modi's cleanliness campaign
 unhone kaha, meraa puraa parivaar congressi he
 Till then, two of the three men who came with him were seen wearing yellow T-shirts on which Kuldeep was a social worker
 jindagi terning point
 
 
 Five years ago, Kuldeep had dengue, the platelets had fallen below 6000
 hafte bhar isiu main rahakar kisi tarah unhen dobaaraa jindagi mili
 Since then, Kuldeep says that he is confident that this is his second birth
 dengue se thik hote hi pehle shiksha vibhaag kii sarkari naukari chodi
 Then some friends and 15 people were hired and started the work of cleaning the dirt of the village
 subah uthanaa scooter se gaanv ke chakkar lagaana jahaan gandagi ho vahaan apane logon ko bhejkar safai karwaanaa
 It is included in their daily routine
 dengue or malaria ke badhate maamalon ko dekhakar unhone nigam se dawa chhidakane kii guhaar lagaai, lekin nigam jab sust padaa rahaa to khud hi dawa chhidkaav kii mashin or dawa laakar ilaake main chhidakane lage
 In Jagatpur village, he lives in the same house with his four brothers
 kuldeep kii maa majaak main unhen jamaadaar kahkar pukaarti he
 Home-grown people are therefore distributing salaries to their cleaning team for about Rs 1
25 lakh a month
 vah safai ko lekar itane bhavuk ki kai baar jab gandagi kii shikaayat ko lekar unke paas kisi kaa phone aata he
 So he goes to the spot himself with his cleaning staff in the Scorpions
 ab log bhale un par hanse, lekin unhen gali-mohallon ke safai kaa junun savaar he
 Had few such people been involved in the Navratnas of the BJP, rather than those who proved to be favorable for good faces and political gains, the change would have intensified

 The father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi, was shot and killed on 30 January 1948
 aaj baapu kii punyatithi (mahatma Gandhi Death Anniversary 2019) ke maukey par puraa desh unhen yaad kar rahaa he
 Bapu was assassinated by Nathuram Vinayak Godse
 godse ne 30 janvari 1948 ko baapu kaa seenaa us vakt chalni kar diya jab ve dilli ke birla bhawan main shaam kii prarthana sabha se uth rahe the
 Godse removed the woman standing with Bapu and killed him one by three from his semi-automatic pistol
 nathuram godse ko mahatma gandhi kii hatya karne ke turant baad hi giraftaar kar liya gaya
 After this, he went on trial in Shimla court
 nathuram godse ko 8 november, 1949 ko faansee kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 After which he was hanged on November 15, 1949
 gandhi (mahatma Gandhi) kii hatya ke baad unke putr devdas gandhi nathuram se milane pahunche
 In reference to this, Nathuram Godse's brother wrote in his book "why did i kill Gandhi", "devdas (son of Gandhi) may have come in the hope that he will have a gruesome face, a thirsty murderer of Gandhi's blood Will be seen, but Nathuram was comfortable and gentle
 unka aatm vishwaas bana hua tha
 Just the opposite of what Devdas might have thought

 kargil yuddh ke dauraan unhone samudr tal se 17,400 feet se zyada kii unchai par sthit pakistani chaowkee ko lager niyantrit bamon ke jariye dhwast kar diya tha
 This outpost built by Pakistan on Tiger Hill was strategically important, as it would allow Pakistani troops to directly target National Highway 1A and Drass connecting Srinagar and Leh
 ye payalat tab kaaphi yuva tha
 Some of the flight lieutenants, including squadron leaders, were around 20 years old
 ye sabhi is baat ko lekar niraash the ki sidhi muthbhed ko lekar bharat main anirnay kii sthiti kii vajah se unhen pakistani vayusena se do-do haath karne kaa mauka kabhi nahin mil paaegaa
 Shripad Tokaker, then Flight Lieutenant, says that at that time he was posted at Adampur Airbase in Punjab
 vah kehete hai, 'ham jaanate the ki ve (pakistani vaayu sena) vahiin aasapaas hai, kyonki hamaare vimaanon ke radar unki gatividhiyaan pakad rahe the
 Although we never got the chance to encounter - i think it was a very disappointing experience
 ' At the same time, DK Patnaik, who was the squadron leader at the time, gave me the opportunity to fly on Mirage-2000, one of the fighters used in the Kargil war
 jab maine unase poocha ki kya kargil ke dauraan apane mishan se pehle unke koi ghabrahat hui thi, is par vah kehete hai, 'ek baar vimaan kaa ingine shuru hone par sab kuch saamaanya ho jaataa he
 We were trained for this
 haalanki tab thodi ashanka to jarur hui thi
 i think this kind of apprehension happens before the first flight
 ' Fighter pilots carried out this mission by flying at an altitude of 33,000 feet above sea level
 17 june, 1999 ko jab kargil yuddh charam par tha, tab patnayak muntho dhaalo par sthit mahatvapurn pakistani chaowkee kaa pataa lagane or us par hamalaa karne vaale pehle payalat the
 This outpost was his administrative and logistic base for the Pakistani army intruding on Indian soil in the Batalik sector of Ladakh
 kargil yuddh ke dauraan puri pakistani sena ke liye yah ridh ke samaan tha
 Relying on the Mirage-2000's computer assisted capability to target weapons, Air Force officers like Squadron Leader Patnaik took a direct dive from high altitude and broke the back of the Pakistani Army's war machinery
 ab varisht group captain ban chuke tokekar or air vaais marshall patnayak ko 1999 ke abhiyaan main unki bahaduree ke liye sammaan bhi mila

 In the weeks and months before May 16, 2014, when Narendra Modi's election bulldozer was trampling everything in the country and after a long time an undiscovered electoral atmosphere was building up in the country, at that time some sensible people called this 'wave'
 While assessing, he used to laugh and said that it looks like this man will win on May 16 and his army shouting 'modi Modi' rally by rally will get a job e-mail on the morning of May 17
 16 may ko jari parinaamon main narendra modi kii jeet beshak hui or jaahir he ki agle din naukari kaa koi mail bhi kisi ke paas nahin pahunchaa

 Especially when the concrete walls of policies are to be broken, the structure of the nation has to be shaken and its mindset changed; New structures have to be made and more important than this is to set the Lakshman Rekha for a force of ministers who have no previous experience; Decision making should be centralized and capture not only the medium but also the messages; And realizing the promotional importance of posts and names, it is necessary to open a Pandora's box of schemes and programs which see that some work is going on: like Jan Dhan, Namami Gange, Make in India, Skill India, Beti Bachao, etc

 In the previous UPA-2 government, the story which was seen to consist of scams, poverty cries and policy laxity has now replaced elements of ambition, competition and activism

 Bureaucracy and Administration: Centralized Centralization If the best administrative picture of how this government has functioned during the last one year is to be drawn, then the relationship between the Prime Minister and the infrastructure that runs the country is called bureaucracy

 Therefore, the government is adopting a policy of weakening the provisions of such schemes and programs

 But there is overall positive atmosphere in the country regarding Modi
 logon ko lagata he ki unke paas ek aisa netaa he, jiske saath ve khud ko jod sakate hai
 People feel connected to them and can get direct information from the government
 " log yah samajhane lage hai ki sarkari nitiyon kii jaankaree unhen sampadakon, stambhakaron, tivi ankaron or vishleshkon ke bina bhi mil sakati he or maujuuda daur main soshal media ke nayak ban chuke modi kii yahi sabase badi uplabdhi he

 This is the second collection of poetry by poet Rajkishore Rajan
 ve ek aise kavi hai, jo saamne aane vaali har shai se takaraate hai, ulajhate hai, us par apni raay banaate hai or is tarah unki kavitaai, aage badhati he
 This opinion is usually to understand themselves, but in this way they often take their readers along
 yahaan dainandin vyavhaar ke dheron chitra hai, jo aaj kii kavita main chhutate ja rahe hai
 By reading most of today's poets, you cannot know what is happening in their life
 rajan ke saath aisa nahin he
 Life is present there with its diverse ragas and colors
 uske kachche-pakke rangon ko ve sahajata se ubharne dete hai, dur kii kaudi laane ke praytn main ve, sahajata se umagate bhaavon par darshan kii kalai nahin potte
 It was Sunday that day and it was midday / on the chair / feet on the guava stem / i wanted to write another poem / in my diary
 saral, sidhi-si baat he yahaan
 If there is some orderliness in life in the initial phase of the poem, then the poem starts with such pictures
 aisa nahin ki vichaar tatv kaa abhaav he kavi main
 23 November 2011: Look in pictures India Today 16 November 2011: Look in pictures India Today - He keeps fingers on the troubles of the place: one by one people have changed / changed the way / everything means / nothing left / Even / has become a joke
 kavi chintit he ki shabdon ke maani badal rahe hai, bedakhal ho rahe hai ki majaak kahin chalaa gaya he dur-desh
 'to laugh while laughing
 yahaan arun camel kii ek kavita yaad aati he, jisamen dak tikat par jeebh phiraate bhi kavi ko dar lagata he ki usamen jehar na ho
 However Rajan's disappointment is not like Arun's
 jivan-jagat ke jaahir chitron ke saath uske chupe rahasyon par bhi nigaah he kavi kii or samay se chhot rahi chizon ko bhi vah darj karata jaataa he-jo sabase batch jaataa / koi kavi rach jaataa
 Friends are mentioned in many of Rajan's poems
 unki shikaayat he ki aaj ke samay main dosti sabase kutil shabd ho gaya haih jane kya ho gaya he in dinon / ki ek-ek kar bane saathi / chalis kii umr tak pahunchate-pahunchate / ho rahe / ek-ek kar dur
 Here the poet has to note that it is not proper for a poet to make direct friendship synonymous with notoriety
 is kutilata ke karkon kii padtaal or peeche kii vidambnaaon ko ujagar karne kii jimmedaari bhi uski he
 Like this, Rajan also has poems tracking the irony and grunts of daily life
 ramdana ke laddu or pathar kii nadi aadi aisi hi kavitaayen hai: ki saundarya ke peeche / kurupata chaaya kii tarah / chali aa rahi he sadaa se
 There are many poems in the collection, which are like commentaries or statements on various life situations
 in bayanon kaa mukammal hona abhi baaki he
 This way the poet believes in the reality of life, his harsh truths
 sachaaiyon par yah vishwaas uski bhavishya kii kavita ko ek thos jameen muhaiyaa karaayega, aisi aashaa kar sakate hai ham
 It is also the belief of the poet himself "that belief and poetry are the same thing for me
" 
 
 '' The Central Delhi Police has lost sleep several hours after news and reports of the suspected death of three teenagers in the alleged road accident on Saturday night appeared in the media
 raat kii ghatana kii adhikrut jaankaree ghanton baad tak bhi media ko na dene vaale, madhya dilli jila disipi or dilli police ke mukhya pravaktaa mandeep singh randhaava ne whatsap group main ravivaar din main kareeb 11 bajkar 50 minute par bataaya ki, ve din main dedh baje ghatana ke bare main media ko bataaenge
 It is noteworthy that three teenagers Saad, Hamza and Osama, who were riding Scooty, were tragically killed in an alleged suspicious road accident in the Delhi Gate area of central Delhi on Saturday night
 teenon aapas main rishtedaar bataaye jate hai
 The three teenagers, who died in suspicious circumstances, had reached the wedding ceremony in Turkman Gate area
 vahaan se ve skuti par savaar hokar raat ke vakt nikal gaye
 Saad's father, the victim of the accident, told the media on the night of the incident, "this is not just a road accident
 darasal kuch police vaale skuti savaar kishoron kaa peechha kar rahe the
 Then all three died due to accident
 haadase ke shikaar kishoron main se kuch logone astapatal main daakhil karaayaa tha
 Saad's father alleged, "if the Central District Police is honest then why is it hiding the CCTV footage of the incident? Everything will be visible in CCTV whether the police were allegedly chasing Scooty or not
" ? "according to eyewitnesses and media reports present at the scene," DCP Mandeep Singh Randhawa reached the spot along with the force after the incident
 ' sawaal yah paidaa hota he ki jab disipi khud maukey par the yaa nahin the? itane bade haadase kaa sisitivi footage aakhir police kis shadyantra ke tahat saamne nahin laa rahi he?' doosraa sawaal ki, raat ke vakt hui ghatana kii koi adhikrut jaankaree aakhir dilli police ke pravaktaa or madhya jile ke disipi mandeep singh randhaava ne media se kyon chipaaye rahe? agar teenon yuvakon kii maut main police kii bhoomika sandigdh nahin he? jabaki yahi dilli police pravaktaa ek-do jhapatmar, chor-uchakke pakad lene par din bhar apane public relation cell (piaaro section) ke jariye bataane ke liye bhaagambhag main lage rahete hai
 When the police kept hiding the incident for hours by not sharing any authorized information from the media, it is impossible to deny the allegations of the victims' families again
 matlab kahin na kahin police sandigdh he
 And all these allegations of the victim families have some merit

 Former US President Barack Obama's wife Michelle Obama has targeted the Donald Trump
 unhone kaha ki yah jagah (america) ham sabhi kii he
 This is what makes our country the greatest diversity here

 We must always remember that America belongs not to us or to you, but to all of us

 Also, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on Tuesday slammed President Trump for making racist remarks
 dhyaan ho ki trump ne chaaron netaaon ko lekar kaha tha ki agar vah america main khush nahin hai to apane mul desh waapas janaa chahie
 Significantly, this is not the first time that Michelle Obama has attacked Donald Trump
 isse pehle america kii pratham mahila rahete hue mishael obama ne us samay raashtrapati pad ke republican ummidavaar donald trump par hamalaa karte hue kaha tha ki sabhy log mahilaon kaa ‘apmaan' nahin karte
 He appealed to Americans not to tolerate such behavior by any male

 He said that people of all backgrounds and all sections agree that civilized people do not insult women and we should not tolerate such behavior of any man
 hillari ke paksh main prachaar karte hue 52 varshiya mishael ne raily main trump ke khilaaf apana paksh majbootee se rakhaa
 He had said that in this race we have a candidate whose vision is completely submerged in our country

 a candidate who talks about pitting us against each other, building walls and asking for fear
 hillari ko ‘mitra' qaraar dete hue mishael ne kaha ki desh ke bare main purv videsh mantri kaa ek bhinn najariya he jisamen desh ko or aage badhaane ke liye sabakuch he
 Michelle had said that Hillary's mother was an orphan, her parents abandoned her
 hillari ke pita (jo chote vyavsaay ke maalik the) kitabon ke adhyayan main lage rahete the or apane parivaar kii behatari ke liye kathin parishram karte the
 Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor's relationship news is getting headlines these days
 haal hi main donon ko jab sonam kii shaadi main saath dekha gaya to iskaa saboot bhi mila
 These days, a 2013 video of Alia is going viral in which she reached Karan Johar's show Koffee with Karan with the starcast of 'student of the Year' and is seen taking Ranbir Kapoor's name from Babaki
 episod ke ek rapid fire round ke dauraan jab unase poocha gaya ki wo kis actor ke saath hot seens karne se nahin ghabaraaengi? to aalia ne bina hichake ranbir kapur kaa naam liya
 Apart from this, when she was asked with whom she would like to marry and whom to kill, in this, she also took the name of Ranbir Kapoor on the question of marriage
 aalia bhatta ne bataai dil kii baat, ranbir ke papa sang karnaa chaahati hai kamiske alaava bhi kai saare aise maukey hai jahaan par aalia khule taur par apni chahat kaa zikr karte hue ranbir kaa naam leti najar ai hai
 Some time ago, fashion designer Manish Malhotra also hinted that Alia and Ranbir might give a new dimension to their relationship this year

 The Congress workers were very much visible in the booths of this assembly seat, but the workers of their party BJP were absent in many places
 poochne par pataa chalaa ki party kaaryakarta khaanaa khaane gaye hue hai
 Khanduri wondered why the Congress people did not go to eat
 77 varshiya khandudi ne kotdwar ko surakshit seat ke taur par chunaa tha
 He used to get a good edge from this area while contesting from Garhwal Lok Sabha constituency
 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaav main yahaan se bhaajapa ke shailendra singh ravat vijayi hue the
 Seeing all this, the party announced his candidature from Kotdwar on 8 January
 lekin yahaan se maano aasmaan fat padaa
 Rawat revolted
 11 or 12 janvari ko unke samarthakon ne dehradun main party karyaalay ko gher liya or jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 Rawat was later persuaded to promote Khanduri, but the damage was done by then

 ve booth par tike hi nahin
 Nainwal also accuses former Chief Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank
 ve kahati hai, 'sabhi kii jubaan par he ki khandudi ko haraane ke liye nishank ne paisa lagaaya
 The BJP formed a government in Uttarakhand under Khanduri in 2007, but lost all seats in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections to replace Khanduri
 par chunaav se thik pehle party ko laga ki nishank ke netritv main chunaav jeetna mushkil hoga
 Hence Khanduri was brought back on 11 September 2011 and the party decided to contest the election under the slogan 'khanduri Hai Necessary'

 jdu's Sitamarhi candidate Dr
 varuna kumaar ke chunaav ladane se inkaar karne kii vajah se party kii fajihat ho gai he
 However, now JDU has declared Sunil Kumar Pintu as its candidate for this Lok Sabha seat
 jediu ke saath yah pehla maamla nahin he jab kisi ummidavaar ne chunaav ladane se inkaar kar diya ho
 Dr JDU candidate from Sitamarhi varuna kumaar ne to namakan karne se pehle hi apni ummidavaari chhod di
 This has happened with JDU earlier too, in which the candidate nominated and then refused to contest
 saal 2014 main jediu pehali baar akele dam par bihar kii 40 siton par chunaav lard rahi thi
 JDU nominated Akhtarul Iman from Kishanganj as its candidate
 akhtarul imaan ne apana parchaa bhi daakhil kar diya lekin ek din achaanak bich prachaar main unhone chunaav ladane se inkaar kar diya
 Akhtarul argued that he was taking these steps to curb the communal powers and he went in favor of the Congress candidate
 us samay namakan kii prakriya bhi samaapt ho gai thi isliye jediu koi doosraa ummidavaar bhi nahin utaar sakati thi
 During that time JDU lost without contesting a seat
 vahiin akhtarul imaan is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main ovaisi kii party eimm (AIMIM) se kishanganj se ummidavaar hai
 During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, many candidates refused to contest on the JDU ticket
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne sabir ali ko shivahar se jediu kaa ummidavaar banaaya tha unhen sibanl bhi de diya gaya tha lekin unhone parchaa nahin bharaa or baad main chunaav ladane se hi manaa kar diya
 After this, JDU had to field Shahid Ali Khan
 saal 2014 main hi shivanand tiwari ne baxur se or en
 K
 singh ne baankaa se chunaav ladane se inkaar kar diya tha
 Though he was not the party's declared candidate, but his candidature was also fixed
 film nirmaataa nirdeshak prakaash jha bhi pashchimi champaran se chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate the
 On being told enough, he was ready to contest elections
 wo chunaav haar jarur gaye lekin jediu ke 90 pratishat ummidavaaron se unka pradarshan acha rahaa
 However Dr Varun Kumar has stated his personal reason behind not contesting the election and JDU has declared Sunil Kumar Pintu as its candidate from Sitamarhi

 @meaindia sushma Ji please follow your tradition, just to please someone no need to look like them In Ujjain, questions have started to arise for the madrasa operators not taking the mid-day meal
 gwalior idgah kampu ke imam ne ujjain madrasa sanchaalkon ke faisle par kadi aapatti uthaai he
 He said that if the madrasa operators are refusing to take the mid-day meal, then they should not take the money from the government
 galat he ujjain madrasa sanchaalkon kaa faisla- imamgwalior main idgah kampu ke imam mo
 Naeem Raza has given a sharp statement on the Ujjain madrasa operators
 unhone kaha he ki sarkaar keemid de milaki yojana bahut acchhee he
 In this food is reaching government schools and madrasas
 meet ke alaava agar bhojan pahunch rahaa he to jaij he or isamen koi etraj nahin he
 He said on the statement that the mid-day meal is offered to God, when the farmer sows grain in the field, he first offers it to God and then after that the grain comes everywhere
 use sabhi dharm ke log khate hai
 Those who are opposing it, the right thing is that they have not seen food being made
 ujjain main paanchave din bhi nahin banta madrason main mid-de mileujjain ke madrase aaj bhi madhya pradesh sarkaar kii ore se die jane vaala mid de mile kaa bhojan nahin le rahe hai
 The chairman of Madrasa Education Committee Ujjain says that this decision has been taken due to opposition from family members
 madrasa shiksha samiti ke adhyaksh ashfak khan kaa kahana he ki bacchon ke abhibhavakon ko kai tarah kii aapattiyaan hai, jisamen khaanaa bhejne kaa time or khaane kii quality shaamil hai
 Ashfaq says that if he does not listen to the parents, he will stop sending his child

 He has demanded that the children associated with Madrasas should be cooked and fed in Madrasas
 prabharee colector or madrase ke bich baithak ho chuki he lekin is baithak kaa koi nateeja dikh nahin rahaa he
 Madrasah you have maintained your stand

 Only the food which was in the past was made in madrasas
 ab kyonki centrulij kichan ke madhyam se bhojan banaaya ja rahaa hai, to centrulij kichan main kis madhyam segunvatttacontrol ho or kis madhyam se bhojan sabhi bacchon ko praapt hoga, iske sambandh main unase charchaa chal rahi he
 Which we will close out soon
 lavaania kaa maananaa he ki aisa nahi hai ki khaanaa lene se manaa kar diya gaya he balki sirf kuch chintaaen hai ki centrulij kichan main kis tarah se bhojan kii gunvattta vagairah par najar rakhi jaati he
 In this case we will close this issue by sitting with them and telling them all the things

 Chennai have 16 points with 8 wins from 12 matches and became the first team to reach the play-off
 agle donon match chennai ko is sizan kii do sabase kamazor timen dilli or punjab ke khilaaf khilne hai
 In such a situation, Dhoni will try to remain as the No

 The next two matches Chennai have to play against Delhi and Punjab, the two weakest teams of this season
 aise main dhoni kii koshish play of main number 1 team ke taur par bane rahane kii hogi, taaki unhen final main entry ke do maukey mil saken

 The sudden rise in the Sensex, which has been witnessing a steady decline, is due to a declaration made by the Finance Minister in the General Budget

 rajya main vidhansabha kii 90 siton main se bijepi ko 40, congress ko 31, jananaayak janata party ko 10 or siten mili hai

 Return of Congress: Congress has made a tremendous comeback in this assembly election
 party ko 2014 ke chunaav main buree haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha or congress indian neshnal lokdal se bhi peeche chali gai thi
 a few weeks before the election, the Congress high command handed over the state's command to former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda
 unhen party kii prachaar samiti kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya tha
 Manjit Sehgal, deputy editor of India Today TV in Chandigarh, believes that Hooda's appeal to the Jat community was the reason behind this withdrawal of the Congress
 iske alaava congress ne krishi sankat or berogari ko dur karne kaa vaada kiya, jiske kaaran use samarthan mila
 He says, "unfortunately the Congress could not promote its manifesto in the state with full force
 ' party ne 40 star prachaarkon kii list banaai thi lekin baad main 26 gaayab kar die gaye
 The bjp's campaign focused entirely on national issues, such as abolishing the special status of Kashmir and the Balakot strike and Modi's magical leadership
 sahagal kaa maananaa he, 'haryana k tamaam matadaataaon ko yah mahasoos hua ki khatter sarkaar unke muddon par gaur nahin kar rahi he
 Apart from this, the presence of Bhupinder Singh Hooda affected the Jat votes which resulted in a loss to the BJP

 But with the economy slowing down, the cash-strapped public in the pocket, the public ignored their economic security and local issues during the voting and skipped the BJP
 haa itnaa jarur hua ki chunaav ke dauraan anuchhed 370 ke zikr ne bijepi ko utane vot jarur de die jitne main wo jaise-taise donon rajyon main sarkaar bana legi
 If the BJP had not decided to make Article 370 ineffective, then it could have been even worse in these elections, but people saw this decision related to the Modi government's dilemma and the people facing trouble on the economic front, the national right in anger Voted modi-shah in the name of unity
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main rajya kaa itihaas nahin badla
 Siddaramaiah could return to power to break the 33-year-old record, but in the initial trends, the Congress is lagging far behind and could prove to be a failure to form a government
 aise main siddharmaiya kaa siem pad se hatana tay mana ja rahaa he
 Let me tell you that if Congress managed to touch the magic figure under the leadership of Siddaramaiah in the Karnataka Assembly elections, then the electoral history of the state would also be rewritten
 rajya kii raajnneeti main pichley 33 saalon main sattadhari party lagaataar dobaaraa satta main vaapasi nahin kar saki he
 Not only this, except in 2013, the ruling party at the center could never get majority in the state
 aise main siddharmaiya jeet ke saath satta main vaapasi karne main safal hote hai to phir pichley teen dashak purana record tuutegaa or ve ek nayaa itihaas likhenge
 However, this is hardly visible in the initial trends
 bataa den ki 1972 se pehle ise mysore rajya ke naam se janaa jaataa tha, lekin purnanamakaran kar iskaa naam karnataka kar diya gaya
 If we look at the political history of Karnataka for four decades, the Janata Party government was formed twice in 1983 and 1985
 iske baad se jab bhi vidhansabha chunaav hue hai, sattadhari party lagaataar duusari baar satta main vaapasi nahin kar saki
 The Congress won the fifth Assembly elections in 1972 and the sixth election in 1978, after Mysore was named Karnataka
 apatkaal ke baad1983 main hue rajya ke saatven vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii satta se vidaai hui or janata party kii sarkaar bani
 The Janata Party won 95 seats and Ramakrishna Hegde, along with other smaller parties, formed the first non-congress government in the state
 haalanki, ye sarkaar zyada din nahin chal saki
 After this, in the 1985 elections, the Janata Party achieved a grand success with 139 seats
 ye vahi daur tha, jab centre kii satta par indira gandhi ke netritv vaali congress kii sarkaar thi
 Despite this, his magic could not work in Karnataka and the state could not come to power
 1989 main karnataka ke saatven vidhansabha chunaav hue, janata party kii vidaai hui or congress ne jabardast jeet ke saath satta main vaapasi kii
 And the record of winning the highest ever 178 seats in the history of the state, which no party has yet broken
 iske baad 1994 main vidhansabha chunaav hue main congress ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Janata Dal formed the government by winning 115 seats under the leadership of HD Deve Gowda
 jabaki centre kii satta main pivi narsimharav ke netritv main congress kii sarkaar thi
 Five years later, in the 1999 assembly elections, the Janata Dal had to face a crushing defeat at the hands of the Congress

 This was the same time when the BJP coalition under the leadership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the NDA government at the center

 The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 79 seats and the Congress got 65 seats

 At the same time, the Congress coalition government was in power at the Center
 iske baad jedies ne bijepi ke saath sarkaar banaai or kumaraswami mukhyamantri bane
 The JD (S) assembly elections in 2008 had to face a crushing defeat

 BJP government was formed for the first time in South India
 2008 main centre main congress ke netritv vaali sarkaar thi
 Despite this, the Congress was reduced to just 80 seats
 paanch saal ke baad 2013 main vidhansabha chunaav hue to bijepi ko karaari haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa, jabaki congress 122 siton ke saath bahumat darj karke satta par virajman hui

 By giving false pretenses like getting admission in Ed, he cheated lakhs of rupees from about a dozen people
 police ke mutabik vah apane shikaar ko pradesh sarkaar ke mantri narottam mishra ke bangale par le jaataa tha
 So that he can win their trust
 wo aise samay par mantri ke bangale par gaya, jab mantri khud vahaan maujuud nahin the
 According to the police, Thagrajesh Sharma, a master, described himself as a senior officer of RNS College in Gwalior
 police ne bataaya ki rajdhani bhopal ke ashoka garden main rahane vaale sanjay kumaar sharma ek medical store chalaate hai
 He told the police that 4 months ago Rajesh Sharma came to his shop to get medicine
 usee dauraan rajesh ne sanjay ko bataaya ki wo gwalior ke arenes college main bade pad par tainaat he or vah pradesh sarkaar ke mantri narottam mishra kaa bahut khaas he
 He can get direct admission to any college
 sanjay ke mutabik wo uski baton main aa gaya or bied main apni bahan kaa admician karaane ke liye use 60 hajaar rupee de die
 After this Rajesh told Sanjay that he has some houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 sanjay phir rajesh ke jhaanse main aa gaya
 He also asked Rajesh to get him a house
 isi tarah kaa jhansa dekar rajesh ne sanjay samet darjanabhar logon se 5 lakh rupee le liye

 magar baad main usne atal bihari vaajapeyi kii maut kaa bahaanaa banaaya or makaan dene kii taarikh ek maah badha di
 Rajesh adopted a unique approach to win the trust of Sanjay and others
 wo sanjay or duusare logon ko chaar imali main mantri narottam mishra ke bangale par le gaya
 When the guard stops at the gate, Rajesh scolds him
 andar jaakar ek kamare main baithe staff se rajesh ne poocha ki mantri ji hai, jawaab mila ki mantri ji nahin hai
 After this, Rajesh said to everyone in a cold sense that i show all you people a bungalow
 phir usne sabhi ko puure bangale main ghumaya
 Rajesh did this not once but twice
 haalanki donon hi baar mantri narottam mishra vahaan maujuud nahin the
 Rajesh then took them all to a site and showed the building under construction there that they were home to PMRY
 sabhi logon ne us par pakkaa vishwaas kar liya
 But Sanjay's sister did not get admission in the college
 to sanjay ne rajesh se college main jamaa kii gai fees raseed maangi
 Rajesh opened the college site with Sanjay's computer and removed the print of a receipt
 jab sanjay ne raseed par likhe number par phone kiya, to wo number kisi mahila kaa niklaa
