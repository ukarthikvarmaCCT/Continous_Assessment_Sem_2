 SS Virk has written that he has been in talks with Hemant Karkare on the so-called saffron terror
 ek baar hemanth karkare ne unhen bataaya tha ki maharashtra ke kuch hisson main bagair kisi kaaran bam balast hue the
 When there was some doubt, he went to the places of Ballast for investigation as the ATS Chief

 When an in-depth investigation was found, it was found that his initial apprehension proved to be true that a fierce Hindu organization had emerged which acted like a module of terror
 yah udai islamic aatank ko chunauti dene ke liye hua tha
 We read this from the printed article of SS Virk and told you in Hindi

 Outlook published a news report on 29 November 2008, stating that in the campaigning for the assembly elections, Chief Minister Modi had questioned the investigation of Malegaon blast
 aties chif hemanth karkare ko congress ke ishaare par kaam karne vaala bataaya tha
 Outlook has not published a verbatim statement of Modi's speech
 pradhanmantri modi, rajnath singh or anya netaa tab kii aties or hemanth karkare par sawaal uthaate rahe hai
 Pragya Thakur is an accused in the Malegaon blast case
 isse pehle un par hatya ke ek maamle kaa mukadmaa chalaa tha
 Pragya Thakur was also accused in the case of the murder of Sunil Joshi, an activist of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 29 disbanr 2007 kii raat sunil joshi kii hatya hoti he or madhya pradesh police jaldi hi cese band kar detii he
 Then there was the BJP government, then why was the case of killing of union worker closed so soon? When the NIA caught a person named Harshad in the case of terror, the mystery of Sunil Joshi's murder was revealed
 enie kii adaalat ne sunil joshi kii hatya kaa maamla sthaneey court ko saunp diya
 After this, the file of Sunil Joshi's murder opens and investigation is done

 All these are acquitted, but in this judgment, Judge Rajiv Apte writes serious questions on the investigation of NIA and Madhya Pradesh Police - both Madhya Pradesh Police Industrial Area Dewas and National Research Tribunal (NIA) research in sensitive and serious cases like murder
 Agencies did not seriously research due to bias or unknown reasons, as opposed to weak nature Cool evidence collected, the Accused has become not enough to be convicted in the fabricated charges against them, causing serious doubts about the plot of the prosecution evidence the contradictory nature
 kya ise clin chit kaha jayega? to kya is faisle kii apil hoicourt main nahin honi chahie thi
 The case was about the murder of Sunil Joshi

 In February 2017, Shivraj Singh Chauhan was the Chief Minister
 devas colector ne jo file rajya ke vidhi vibhaag ko bheji hogi vah kahaan he
 Why does Kamal Nath's government not speak on that
 kya nichali adaalat ke insaaf ko antim insaaf mana ja saktaa he
 After all, how was Sunil Joshi's murder forgotten? kise bachaane ke liye bhulaayaa gaya
 The former Chief Minister should tell why when the appeal is made in the High Court even in the general case of murder, then why was not the appeal in the High Court in this matter
 kya sangh ke prachaarak sunil joshi kii hatya ke maamle main insaaf dilaanaa unki praathamikta nahin thi
 The religious aspect of Pragya Thakur is being raised so that some basic facts can be kept away from the public

 This case came before the Supreme Court once again in 2011 but his claim was found to be hypothetical
 23 april ko mumbai adaalat main pragna thakur ne bhi mana ki un par aarope hai
 They are out on bail
 unki yah baat sahi he ki aaropee ko chunaav ladane se manaahi nahin he
 As far as torture of Pragya Thakur is concerned, it has been thoroughly investigated
 agar tab bhi vishwaas nahin tha to maujuuda endie sarkaar alag se isaki jaanch kara sakati thi
 The charges against Pragya Thakur were settled in 2018 when the NDA was in government

 Their job is to threaten and eliminate those who condemn or oppose Hinduism
 uske liye pistaul or hathgolon kaa istamaal karnaa
 It is written in the charge sheet and is yet to be proved
 kya ye sara kaam shanti kaa he? vasudaiv kutunbakam kaa he?is chargeshit main kaha gaya he ki kuch aaropee sanaanath sanstha or hindu janajagriti sanstha ke sadsy hai
 Sanatan Sanstha had termed it wrong and said that those arrested have no connection with this institution

 Film director Rajkumar Santoshi is working on the sequel of 'andaz Apna Apna'
 vah kehete hai ki salmaan khan or aamir donon hi sikval main kaam karne ko taiyaar hai or agar ve film banaate hai to vah unhen film main jarur lenge
 'andaz Apna Apna', released in 1994, did not do much at the box office
 lekin, iske takiyakalam or madhur geeton ne ise hameshaa pasand kii jane vaali hasya film bana diya
 Asked about taking Salman and Aamir in the film sequel, Santoshi said, “it is not possible to repeat them in the sequel
 us samay baat alag thi, lekin aaj ve film jagat ke bade naam hai
 " haalanki, agar salmaan or aamir sikval banaate hai to vah unhen film main lene ke liye taiyaar hai

" " After the terrorist attack on CRPF convoy in Pulwama on 14 February, there was a continuous round of meetings in the Ministry of Home Affairs
 jisamen is baat ko lekar maathapai hoti rahi ki kaise pulavama jaise hamale hone se roka jaae
 According to Home Ministry sources, 8 high-level meetings have been held since the incident, in which inputs were taken from top security officials, including Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Secretary, NSA Ajit Doval and heads of paramilitary security forces
 How to avoid such dangers
 jiskaa parinaam ye rahaa ki ab ghati main suraksha vyavastha ke nae tareeke par samiksha kii ja rahi he
 The important element in this is the vehicle in which the jawans are transported from one place to another during the Troops movement
 sutron ke mutabik in vaahanon ko or aadhunik banane kaa faisla liya gaya he
 According to information received from the sources of the Ministry of Home Affairs, all the vehicles will be used for the jawans in the valley, on which 3 important things will be equipped with immediate effect in the coming days
 pehali cheez 'modular barier' jisko aasaani se kahi bhi install or shift kiya ja saktaa he
 No matter how fast the vehicle is, it will stop there immediately with the help of this barrier
 suicide bombing vaahan ko rokane ke liye ye bahut kargaar he
 They will be placed in the streets instead of the main road, which is connected to the main road, because in the Pulwama attack that took place, the car came from the street and crashed into the convoy
 ghati ke ahm raaston par aise barier lagane kaa bada plan taiyaar kar liya gaya he
 Another important device is the Eye Safe "laser Dazzler", the device is based on laser technology
 is upkaran ko vaahan main maujuud javaanon ko diya jayega
 If the security forces suspect a vehicle that the driver is not listening to the vehicle coming from behind, then this laser dazzler can show the light on the eye of the driver so that they do not bring the vehicle to the convoy
 teesraa upkaran long range "ecostic divaais" he, jiske jariye agar surakshabalon ko shaq hota he ki unke vaahan ke najadik koi sandigdh vaahan aata he to vahus vaahan kii ore is divaais ko karke elaan karenge
 The sound of the security forces will reach the ears of that driver directly
 agar koi aam naagarik par bhi surakshabalon ko shaq hota he to usko nuksaan nahin hoga
 An attempt will be made to stop it only through voice
 grih mantralay main baithkon ke baad is baat par sahmati bani he ki kafile ke vaahanon ko or zyada advance banaaya jayega
 So that an attack like Pulwama can be avoided
 isamen se modular vaahan barier thodi maatra main ghati main pehle se hi tainaat the
 But after this attack, now they will be deployed a lot
 kin-kin jagahon par tainaat kiya jayega yah barier koun si unit ko diya jayega in sab par abhi ranneeti banaai ja rahi he

 The National President of the Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad criticized the controversial 'homecoming' campaign, targeting derogatory remarks from the government's development agenda, with derogatory remarks

 He was referring to the remarks of BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj and Union Minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti early in the year, which called for Hindu women to give birth to at least four children, which was widely condemned
 maharaj nasik main kumbh kaary main maharashtra sarkaar or saadhuon ke bich madhyasthata kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Maharaj also criticized those who have pledged to strengthen the Hindutva campaign through the "homecoming" program
 unhone kaha, ki unhen yah samaj lenaa chahie ki aise pratigaami bayanon kaa hamaare samaaj par yaa hamaare dharm par acha prabhaav nahin padegaa
 The Maharashtra government has sought Maharaj's cooperation to give directions and resolve disputes in the preparatory work at Kumbh and Maharaj is satisfied with the arrangements here

 ’’ maharaj ne kaha ki is kumbh main unke dwaara kisi bhi dharmasabha ko yojit karne kii sambhaavna bahut kam he, kyonki modi sarkaar kaa pradarshan apeksha ke anuroop rahaa he
 He described Devendra Fadnavis as a courageous chief minister who dared to introduce a bill to ban cow slaughter in the state

 mayawati ab dayashankar se mili gaaliyon ko chunavi mudda banaaengi
 She will hold rallies all over UP on this issue
 is kadi kii pehali raily 21 agast ko agra main or duusari 28 agast ko azamgarh main hogi
 In a press conference in Lucknow, Mayawati said that the BJP had called him a remnant of Dayashankar as part of a conspiracy
 lekin isse dalit naaraaz he jo ab bijepi ko vot nahin degaa
 Since Akhilesh Yadav often addresses Mayawati as Buaji, today he said in a press conference that it is his chance to arrest Dayashankar and protect Bua's honor
 or agar nahin karenge to dayashankar ko iskaa jawaab unki sarkaar banane par milegaa
 Mayawati said that if the Chief Minister arrested the convicted Dayashankar Singh in honor of his aunt and did not punish him, then in such a situation strict legal action would be taken against him as soon as the BSP government is formed
 mayawati dayashankar kii gaali ko dalit swabhimaan kaa mudda bananaa chaahati hai
 She says that for a year, Modi and Amit Shah sometimes proclaim to build Ambedkar memorials to dent the Dalit vote and sometimes eat food while sitting on the ground with the Dalits
 lekin pehle rohit vemula kii khudakushi phir una main daliton kii kodon se pitayee or phir unhen gaali die jane se pasa palat gaya he
 Mayawati says that along with the Dalits all over the country, they have brought them to a large extent with the BSP
 idhar mayawati kii press conference khatm hui ki udhar dayashankar kii patni swati singh rajyapal se milane pahunch gayi
 She told the governor everything she had told the media before
 unhone bataaya ki unke or unki beti ke liye bispi ke logon ne behuda naare lagaae
 Swati Singh says, 'I went to him with a complaint and he assured me that he would talk about it
 'tippaniyan Mayawati is upset with Dayashankar's mother and wife
 mayawati ne iljaam lagaaya ki unhone dayashankar ke apshabd kehane ke baad baikfoot par ai bijepi ab dayashankar kii bivi or maa se raajnneeti kara rahi he
 In this country there is politics on religion, on caste, on region, on language
 lekin pehali baar gaali par raajnneeti ho rahi he
 It is the political acumen of the leaders that abuses have also been politicized and in this, Mayawati sees the loss of the upper caste vote and the Dalit vote for the BJP
 chunki akhilesh yadav aksar mayawati ko buaaji kah kar sambodhit karte hai, isliye aaj unhone press conference main kaha ki ye mauka he ki vah dayashankar ko giraftaar kar buaa ke sammaan kii raksha karen
 And if he does not, Dayashankar will get the answer when his government is formed
 mayawati ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ne apni buaa ke maan sammaan main doshi dayashankar singh ko giraftaar kar uske kiye kii usko sajaa nahin dilwaai to aisi sthiti main uttar pradesh main bispi kii sarkaar banate hi inke viruddh sakht kanoonee karrwai bhi jarur kii jaaegi
 Mayawati wants to make Dayashankar's abuse an issue of Dalit self-respect
 wo kahati hai ki ek saal se modi or amit shah dalit vot main send lagane ke liye kabhi ambedkar smarak banane kaa elaan karte hai to kabhi daliton ke saath jameen main baithkar khaanaa khate hai
 But first Rohit Vemula commits suicide, then dumps Dalits in Una and then abuses them
 mayawati kahati hai ki puure desh main daliton ko bhi apane khilaaf karne ke saath-saath unhen kaaphi had tak bispi ke saath laa kar khadaa kar diya he
 Here Mayawati's press conference came to an end that Swati Singh, wife of Dayashankar, went to meet the Governor
 rajyapal se unhone vahi sab baaten bataayin jo vah iske pehle media se kah chuki hai
 He told that the BSP people shouted ridiculous slogans for him and his daughter
 swati singh kahati hai, 'shikaayat lekar main unke paas gai thi or unhone mujhe aashwaasan diya he ki wo usapar baat karenge
 Comments mayawati dayashankar kii maa or patni se khafa hai
 Mayawati blamed that the BJP, which came on the backfoot after Daya Shankar was expelled, is now doing politics with Dayashankar's wife and mother
 is desh main dharm par raajnneeti hoti he, jati par hoti he, kshetra par hoti he, bhashaa par hoti he
 But for the first time politics is being done on abuse
 ye netaaon kaa siyaasi hunar he ki gaali kaa bhi raajnneetikaran kar diya gaya he or isamen fori taur par mayawati ko savarna vot kaa or bijepi ko dalit vot kaa nuksaan dikhataa he
 Mayawati said that if the Chief Minister arrested the convicted Dayashankar Singh in honor of his aunt and did not punish him, then in such a situation strict legal action would be taken against him as soon as the BSP government is formed

 disijan rivyuu system (diares) par bhartiya cricket board kaa raivaya nahin badla he
 The BCCI has been opposing this rule from the very beginning
 barbedas main sampann isisi kii salanaa baithak main bhartiya cricket board ne ek baar phir se diares ke liye inkaar kar diya he
 ICC CEO Dave Richardson gave this information
 haalanki dev richardsan ne ummid jataai he ki aane vaale samay main bisisiai is par sahamat ho jaaegi
 He said - times are changing
 khilaadi bhi aage dekh rahe hai
 New players are adopting modern ideas, so no one can tell about the years to come
 is press conference main richardsan ke saath isisi ke chairman en shrinivasana ko bhi shaamil hona tha, lekin ve aakhri samay main isamen shaamil nahin hue
 Had he been there, he would have perhaps elaborated on the reason for India's refusal
 darasal sachin tendulkar or mahendra singh dhoni sahit kai bhartiya cricketer diares ko masini dakhal maanate hue iskaa virodh kar chuke hai
 The BCCI and Team India do not even consider it a hundred percent correct solution
 tippaniyan However, India's new Test captain Virat Kohli recently made a statement in favor of the Decision Review System
 kohli ne bangladesh daure ke dauraan kaha tha, diares ke mudde par team ke gendbaazon se, ballebaazon se baat karne kii jarurat he
 
 
 i will talk to the team players on this issue
 isisi lagaataar koshish kar rahi he ki bisisiai diares par sahamat ho jaae
 Many current players as well as former players are saying that Team India should adopt DRS
 aisa nahin hone kii surat main videshi dauron par bhartiya team ko ampiring ke galat faisalon se niraashaa kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 In the annual ICC meeting held in Barbados, the Indian Cricket Board has once again refused for DRS
 isaki jaankaree isisi ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari dev richardsan ne di
 However Dave Richardson has expressed hope that the BCCI will agree on this in the coming times
 unhone kaha - samay badal rahaa he
 Players are also looking forward
 nae khilaadi aadhunik idia ko apana rahe hai, aise main aane vaale saalon ke bare main koi bataa nahin saktaa
 ICC Chairman n Srinivasan was also scheduled to join Richardson at this press conference, but did not attend the last minute
 ve vahaan hote to shaayad bharat ke inkaar kii vajah par vistaar se roshni daalate
 In fact, many Indian cricketers including Sachin Tendulkar and Mahendra Singh Dhoni have opposed DRS as a machine intervention
 bisisiai or team india ise sau fisadi sahi upaay bhi nahin maanati he
 The comments haalanki bharat ke nae test captain viraat kohli ne haal hi main disijan rivyuu system ke paksh main bayaan diya tha
 Kohli said during the Bangladesh tour, there is a need to talk to the team bowlers, the batsmen on the issue of DRS
 
 
 main is mudde par team ke khilaadiyon se baat karuunga
 The ICC is constantly trying to get the BCCI to agree on the DRS
 kai maujuuda khilaadiyon ke saath-saath purv khilaadi bhi yahi kah rahe hai ki team india ko diares apana lenaa chahie
 In the absence of this, the Indian team will have to face disappointment due to the wrong umpiring decisions on foreign tours
 haalanki dev richardsan ne ummid jataai he ki aane vaale samay main bisisiai is par sahamat ho jaaegi

 isaki do badi vajahen hai
 For one, the Hindi audience is not very familiar with Caravan's Starcast
 dulkar salmaan jaise sitaron ko hindi darshak zyada nahin jaanate hai
 The second thing is that Irrfan's departure from the country due to illness is a big reason for the film's weak publicity

 Thread each with a word like beads, flow poetic and razor-filled with sarcasm, such that if you feel the sensation, please chew
 kaifi aazmi ke lekhon kii aisi hi ek pustak aa rahi he raajakmal prakaashan se, naam he 'nai gulistaan'
 The introduction of this book is printed in some fashion from the publisher - this is the land of political tanzigar, on which a tanzigar is seen moving with great confidence, and the name of that tanzigar is Kaifi Azmi, same Kaifi Azmi
 Whom the world has come to know and study as a niche poet
 nai gulistaan kii siyaasi tanzanigaari ke namoonon ko pathakon ne saraahaa hi nahin hoga, balki bich-bich main thaharkar unki baton par, unke tarz-bayaan par or unke jajbaat kii sachai or gaharaai par gaur bhi kiya hoga
 Today, on the death anniversary of Kaifi Azmi, for the readers of Aaj Tak, its part: Book excerpt: New Gulistan, an old Kashmiri Khatjulfikar Ali Bhutto's nameless, saadat-etawar ', Mian Zulfikar, have heard that you are very fussy in Pakistan, sometimes Ayub is Pistols show that a ghost is riding on you, it is bad to spend life in peace
 ham kashmiri ki sadaa se kaksaar hai, tumhaare bahut shukraguzaar hai ki tumne dil kii baat bataa di, unki asli tasviir duniya ko dikhaa di ki saalo-saal nahin, tum hamaare liye ek hazaar saal tak ladaai jari rakhoge
 Mian, what happened to you in two weeks, as every front came, a thousand years old thing, Afuni's big, mash flour sounds that you already shouted help in the attack, knocking on the door of China Began ek hazaar saal kya karoge! miyaan aisi baaten munh se nahin nikaala karte
 Well, you boast, American ammo, what do i have to do with this! i want to ask why do you want to die for free, why do you want to take Kashmir
 tumhen maaloom he ki hamaara kashmir zamin kii jananath kehalaata he, yahan insaan aata he farishta ban jaataa he
 allah-allah the snowy hills, the green hills, the flower-workings everywhere, the thorniness of the thorns, the peace pours everywhere, the one living
 yahan dur-daraaj se log aate hai, chaar din jindagi kaa lutf uthaate hai or ham apane mehmaanon kii khidamat karke, raat-din mehnat karke apni zindagi gujaarte hai
 But ever since the British made Pakistan, put usurper in the hands of the monkey, you have ruined our paradise, filled its path with thorns that the visitors who come here now spend holidays in Mussoorie and Nainital
 tumne unka lutf chin liya or hamaari rozi
 In 1947 you instigated the tribes, seduced a few of us, and every day Fitna started waking up, the convoy of Sayyahs ran away from us
 khuda-khuda karke tumhaari saazishen naakaam hui
 Life began to erupt in the plaintiff again, and we who were sitting with each other hand in hand over issues, then started earning some money, started eating hard work
 lekin tumko na jane kyon, hamaara sukun khatkata he, halaq main mehnat kaa niwala kyon atakta he ki tumne apane fauziyon ko sada libaas pahana ke, burqon main banduken chhipaake luteron ko phir bhej diya ki vah hamaara khun bahaayen, jananath ko jahannam banaaen
 It is believed that the Indian Army pushes you back every time, pours your bullets on the chest, yet the peace is ruined
 akhir tumko hamase itnaa pyaar kyon hai! tumne bantwaare main jo kuch paaya, jitna mulk chin-jhapat main liya, ab tak usee ko na kushhaal bana sake, na do vaqt kii roti khilaa sake
 You eat a large part of what you bring here and there, you feed the rest of the people
 hamako apane mulk main milaake, hindustan se dur le jake kya bhukhon kii taadaad badhanaa chaahate ho ?miyaan julfiqaar, ab tum mashallah jawan ho, ayub khan kii jaan ho, kya tumko ab vah din yaad nahin aate jab tum nani kii godi main pade chaand ko dekha karte or baar-baar machalaa karte ki nani hamako yah chaand laa do, or nani kahatee ki so jaao betaa, so jaao, chaand tumko nahin mil saktaa
 Today your grandmother is not in this world and you have gone out of control, you have gone out of control to have someone give us Kashmir
 mujhe kahana padataa he ki so jaao betaa, so jaao, tumhen kashmir nahin mil saktaa
 Mian, know this little writing very much, recognize your voice and leave the madness of joining Kashmir in Pakistan, threatening India again and again
 kashmir hindustan kaa vaisaa hi hissaa he jaise lahore pakistan kaa

 Gandhian Anna Hazare, who is running a mass movement against corruption, said that he does not see any difference between the BJP and the Congress to eradicate this evil
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki congress or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh milakar unhen badnaam karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Face recognition, win prizes
 bhaag lene ke lieclic karenhazare ne congress netaa digvijay singh ke unhen 11 or 12 aktubar ko likhe do patron ke aath prishth ke javaabi khat main kaha, ‘bhrashtachar mitaane ke liye donon hi partiyon (congress or bhaajapa) kii andar kii aawaaj nahin nikalati, bhrashtachar mitaane ke liye donon hi partiyon main mujhe koi fark nahin dikhaayi detaa
 On Digvijay's allegations of associating himself with the Sangh, he said, 'you have tried to connect me with the BJP and the Sangh Parivar
 aapako yaa to pataa nahin hoga yaa jaanakar bhi aap anjaan ban rahe ho
 "the Sangh's Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat's claim that the movement of social workers against corruption has the support of his organization," said Hazare, "I am a believer and will testify to God and say that even one of the RSS in Ramlila Maidan The worker did not come and meet me even once in 12 days
 naa mere andolan main dikhaayi diya
 He said, 'if Bhagwat has said that we were participants in Anna's movement, then i believe that just as your party (congress) is trying to discredit me, the RSS is also trying to discredit me
 
 yaa to aap donon ne miljulkar meri badanaami kii koshish kii hogi
 Hazare said, "I believe that no matter how much your party, BJP and RSS, anyone tries to discredit me, the truth is always the truth
" ’ gandhivadi kaaryakarta ne kaha ki desh kii janata ko bhaajapa, congress yaa aresas se koi lenadena nahin he
 The public is troubled by corruption, until the government of you and your party tries to eradicate corruption, then these false things will not have any effect on the people
 iskaa anubhav aapke bade-bade netaaon ne kiya he
 On Digvijay's claims of his association with the Sangh Parivar on the basis of letters written to him by the Sangh, Hazare said, "to defeat our movement, you are showing the letter of Suresh Bhaiya of RSS to the public, such letters Proof of you are making
 saboot to vah ho saktaa he jab aise patr kaa maine jawaab diya ho
 If there is such a letter, then there can be proof
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘30 saal se samaaj or desh kii bhalaai ke liye main badanaami jhelte aayaa hum or aage bhi badanaami sahan karne kii taiyaari rakhi he
 i know this thing well on the tree where there are fruits
 ’ hazaare ne digvijay ko salaah di ki unke andolan ko dekhne kaa unke chashme kaa rang galat he or unhen chashma badal lenaa chaiye
 On Digvijay's claim of BJP showing him the vegetable of making him the next Presidential candidate, Hazare said, "neither my eligibility to be President nor my desire to become President at heart
" samaj main nahin aata ki aise main kyun congress vaale or bijepi vaale hawa main tir chalaa rahe hai
 Regarding Digvijay's displeasure over his plea to the public not to vote for the Congress in the Hisar Lok Sabha by-election, Hazare said that his party was deferring the Jan Lokpal Bill and Lokayukta Bill into law
 yahi kaaran he ki unhone kaha he ki congress ko vot mat do
 He said, 'but even then did not say vote for BJP
 charitravaan ummidavaar dekhakar vot do
 Whether they are in power or in opposition
 ’ hazaare ne kaha, ‘aap chitthee main likhte hai ki congress or anya dalon ke bheetar fark karnaa chaiye
 i as well as the public feel that some parties are studying about corruption as if they were studying
 kisi ne grameuation kar liya he to kisi ne bhrashtachar main doctoret paayi he
 If you want to make a difference, then only such a difference can be seen
 koun si party saaf he, yahi bada sawaal he
 On Digvijay's advice to enter politics, he said, 'you advised me to get into politics but i have decided that i will not enter any party or party politics till then there are souls in the body
 ’ hazaare ne kaha, ‘meraa to ye daawa he ki bijepi or congress aapas main matbhed dikhaakar janata ko bhulaave main daal rahe hai lekin donon partiyon main koi vishesh fark nahin dikhaayi detaa he
 On Digvijay's complaint about his plea not to vote for the Congress in Hisar, he said, 'if you think don't vote for the Congress, this campaign will benefit the BJP, then why should the Congress give them such an opportunity Has been If the Jan Lokpal and Lokayukta laws are made soon, will they (congress) not benefit? ’hazaare ne kaha ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf 35 varsh ke apane andolanon main unhone kisi vyakti, paksh yaa party ke virodh main andolan nahin kiya he
 But there are also many people in Congress that their intention to stop corruption is not clear

 aisa hoga tabhi musalmaan mahasoos karenge ki hindu hamaare dost ho gayi hai

 kisi bhi mulk main rahane vaale log uske naagarik hote hai to un nagarikon kii alag alag dharmik manyataayen hoti hai
 When someone is asked about citizenship, he says according to his country that he is Indian, American, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan, Brazilian, French
 jab dharm poocha jayega to aap alag se bataaenge ki hindu hai, isai hai, musalmaan hai, sikh hai
 But when you are told that the citizens of India are called Hindus, then what is different from the examples given in this
 kyon 1928 se saavarkar ke pamfalet hindu koun he se lekar aaj tak ham iskaa sawaal aate hi bhid jate hai
 What Mohan Bhagwat has said is not new
 pehali baar nahin kaha he
 But once again the government is formed at the center with the support and active support of the RSS, then no one can ignore their point
 mohan bhagwat ne kaha he ki puri duniya bharatiyon ko hindu maanati he, isliye bharat ek hindu raashtra he
 If there is English living in England, German living in Germany, American living in America, then those who live in Hindustan are Hindus
 amareeki, english kii tarah ham bhartiya kyon nahin hai? ham indian kyon nahin hai? ham hindu hi kyon hai? kya sikh, musmalaan, isai, parsi bhi hindu hai? phir ve sikh kyon hai, musalmaan kyon hai, parsi kyon hai? kya bhagwat ke sabhi hindustaniyon ko hindu kehane se baaki mazahabon main apni pahchaan ko lekar koi bhram kii sthiti paidaa hoti he yaa vah kuch or kah rahe hai
 Is Bhagwat mixing religion and citizenship? bhagwat ke bayaan ko aresas kii us parampara main dekha janaa chahie, jo lambey samay se kahata rahaa he ki hindustan kii apni saanskrithik pahchaan he
 That identity is achieved because before India became a country on August 15, due to the antiquity of its civilization, it was seated as a culture
 pravaahman tha
 But the matter is only for the definition and the game of words for it or indeed Bhagwat is defining your citizenship in another way from here
 pichley dinon goa ke up mukhyamantri francis disuza bharat pehle se hi hindu raashtra he
 All Indians are Hindus
 francis apane sahyogi deepak dhaavikar ke bayaan ke bachaav main kah rahe the, jinhone kaha tha ki modi desh ko hindu raashtra bana sakate hai
 So d'souza says that there is a need to create what is already there
 disuja ne tab kaha tha ki main chrishchiyan hindu hum
 However d'souza sahab later apologized
 kaha ki meri raay dusron ke liye sahi nahin ho sakati he
 i accept main nahin kahata ki yahi sabase sahi raay he
 i apologize if someone is hurt
 hindu meri samskruti he christianity meraa dharm
 When i say that i am a Hindu, it means culture, not religion
 goa ke catholic sangh ne kaha ki ham isai hai
 We can be called Indian Christians
 hamen hindu isai mat kahie
 Would you call a Hindu born in America or Britain according to the religion there? ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhiegaa
 There is no dispute about me or anyone being a Hindu here
 us pahchaan ko zaahir karne ko lekar bhi vivaad nahin he
 But as soon as you say that those who believe in other religion are also Hindus, then there is a dispute
 agar hindu hai to phir bhartiya hona kya radd ho jayega? Sitaram Yechury said the constitution says that India is is India
 ham hindustan kah sakate hai, lekin yah bharat he
 The RSS should tell whether they respect the Constitution or not
 mayawati kahati hai ki jab ambedkar ji ne samvidhan likhaa to yah dhyaan main rakhkar likhaa ki hamaare desh main kai dharm ke log rahete hai
 Hence the name Bharat
 hindustan shabd kaa istamaal nahin hua
 The RSS chief has no knowledge of the constitution
 laalkrishna adwani to hindusthan kehete hai
 Not Hindustan
 apana hi desh he chaahe jis naam se bula lijie
 Just call with love
 is tarah se nahin koi aahat ho jaae
 When i told PTI during the election campaign to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that i would like to see myself as the first Indian
 main aasthaa se hindu hum or mujhe apni aasthaa par garv he
 i love my country
 isliye aap kah sakate he ki main deshbhakt hum
 Are not the words of Modi and Bhagwat different
 modi apni bhartiyata or dharmikata ko alag-alag bataate hai
 Proud of both
 sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat kehete hai jo hindustani he vah hindu he
 Hindu Nation or Indian means whether all those who are not Hindus or those who are in the Hindu are emphatically included
 yah paribhaasha sirf dil bahalane ke liye diya jaataa he yaa aresas yaa uski madad se chalane vaali bijepi ise lekar gambhir bhi he
 It is a complex and sensitive issue
 aaj se nahin uth rahaa he
 It has been in dispute for seventy-eighty years
 kitaab ke kitaab likhe gaye hai
 Hindi is we are children, Hindustan is ours, it is also said that you will become a Hindu, neither will you become a Muslim, you will become a human being

 dilachasp he ki congress or bijepi ke netaaon ke bich aaropon-pratyaropon kaa yah daur twitor par chal rahaa he
 First the Congress general secretary and former Madhya Pradesh CM Digvijay Singh attacked the BJP by tweeting
 Now Hindi TV channels are taking note of huge VYAPAM scam in MP and C'garh
 Uma Bharti has called it a bigger scam than "chara Ghotala"
 — digvijaya singh (@digvijaya_28)june 23, 2014what has come is only tip of an iceberg
 Almost all appointments and admissions in MBBS should be investigated
 Needle of suspicion on CM now— digvijaya singh (@digvijaya_28)june 23, 2014shall come out about it in detail in a separate Blog
 No reaction coming from BJP and RSS
 Why?— digvijaya singh (@digvijaya_28)june 23, 2014digvijay ke congress netaa shakeel ahamed ne bhi bijepi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 However, he pointed the finger at cm's wife
 shakeel ne twit kiya,jailed Madhaya Pradesh scam accused received 139 phone calls of a lady from CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan's residence
 Who was she? - Shakeel Ahmad (@ahmad_shakeel) June 23, 2014 After these attacks by Congress leaders, Shivraj Singh made a number of tweets and retaliated
 shivaraj ne twit kiya,did thru Vyapam 17 relatives of my wife from Gondiya get selected in parivahan arakshak exam? Not even one
 Nor from entire maharashtra
 — shivrajsingh Chouhan (@chouhanshivraj)june 23, 2014do they not attempt any fact checking on their own before carrying out such ill- motivated baseless canards in media?— shivrajsingh Chouhan (@chouhanshivraj)june 23, 2014they say that 139 phone calls from CM house and issue a Call Details Report where not even one call number is from CM house
 - shivrajsingh Chouhan (@chouhanshivraj) June 23, 2014just as a lie has no legs to stand on, a CDR has no legs of its own
 It requires substantiation
 They do not even see the CDR
 — shivrajsingh Chouhan (@chouhanshivraj)june 23, 2014and i am not going to take it kindly
 a clear case of defamation this is
 They will soon be served notice
 - shivrajsingh Chouhan (@chouhanshivraj) June 23, 2014whatever little i heard of media norms, they require taking the version of the person against whom allegations are being hurled
 And here?— shivrajsingh Chouhan (@chouhanshivraj)june 23, 2014I know defeat hurts
 Particularly when it is twice
 There are few who maintain grace in defeat
 But should they stoop so low? - shivrajsingh Chouhan (@chouhanshivraj) June 23, 2014the entire list of select parivahan aarakshak was available on the departmental website
 They did not care to even have a look at it

 The Supreme Court has given a historic verdict on the country's capital Delhi
 faisle main supreme court ne mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko kuch raahat di he to teen tagade jatke bhi die hai
 The Supreme Court has clearly stated that Delhi does not have full state status
 pehla jhatka: purna rajya kaa darjservind kejariwal kaaphi samay se dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dene kii maang kar rahe the
 But in the hearing today, the court has made it clear that Delhi does not have full state status
 kejariwal kaa kahana tha ki purna rajya kaa darja mili bagaiyr dilli kaa samuchit vikaas nahin ho paa rahaa, lekin court ne unki is maang ko khaarij kar diya
 Second setback: Services MLA Somnath Bharti, appearing for the Delhi government in the Supreme Court, said that in the case of Services and ACB, we are disappointed with the court's decision
 maujuuda vakt main arvind kejariwal dilli main kisi bhi karmchaaree kii transfar-posting nahin kar sakate
 The central government asserts its decision to transfer employees to Delhi
 kejariwal iskaa shuru se virodh kar rahe hai
 Kejriwal has been saying that no one listens to the elected government in Delhi
 unka kahana he ki dilli ke adhikari se lekar karmchaaree tak unki baat nahin maanate
 Due to this, he also staged a 9-day sit-in at LG House
 agar aaj supreme court kaa faisla kejariwal ke haq main aata he to dilli ke adhikariyon-karmchaariyon kii transfar-posting kaa adhikaar bhi kejariwal ko mil jayega
 Third setback: The ACB Supreme Court has also slammed the Kejriwal government over the ACB
 supreme court main dilli sarkaar kii ore se pairvi kar rahe or aap vidhayak somnath bhartiya ne kaha ki services or asibi ke maamle main hamen court ke faisle se niraashaa hui he
 Significantly, the Aam Aadmi Party came into existence only on the fight against corruption
 arvind kejariwal ne dilli main sarkaar banane ke baad sabase jor-shor se jo kaam kiya, usamen bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai rahi he
 Kejriwal formed the Anti Corruption Branch immediately after forming the government
 branch ne tabadatod kai chaape bhi maare
 But here again the Lt
 Governor intervened
 tatkaaleen uparajyapal najeeb jang ne june 2015 main ACB main apni pasand kaa adhikari baitha diya, jiskaa kejariwal sarkaar ne jamkar virodh kiya
 It was from here that the 'lieutenant Governor' and the Chief Minister got 'cold'
 is ghatana ke baad se kejariwal uparajyapal ke virodh main or mukhar ho gaye
 If today the Supreme Court verdict comes in favor of Kejriwal, then in the ACB, Kejriwal will again be able to appoint the officer of his choice and the anti-corruption campaign will be intensified

 In this new system, an encrypted ballot with unique code will be used instead of ballot paper
 iske jariye voter ko yah jaankaree ho sakegi ki unhone kise vot daalaa or unka vot kise gaya he
 It can be tracked anytime

 jab yah maamla shant hua to phir rajyon main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi sawaal khadey kiye gaye

 aisa karnaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 Also, do not share these pictures on Facebook at all
 aisi tasviren baikaphire kar sakati hai

 jitna ye khaas hota he utana hi mushkil bhi
 The couple's first year of marriage is very special, whether it is your love marriage or an arranged marriage
 shaadi kaa bandhan apane aap main bahut si nai baaten samete hue hota he
 In which there is excitement and stress on many things
 shaadi ke baad jahaan bahut si sakaaratmak chijen hoti hai vahiin kai chijen aisi bhi hoti hai jinhen lekar pareshaaniyon kaa bhi saamana karnaa padataa he
 If there is complete understopping between the couples and both of them support each other, then the first year of marriage will be passed every year comfortably, but if there is lack of understading then life will remain as a roller-coaster
 kisi bhi nai shaadishuda jindagi main parivaar bahut myne rakhata he, aise main sabhi ko saath rahane or saath dene kii soch ke saath hi aage badhanaa chahie
 Here are some of the major reasons why the first year of marriage is always considered important: 1
 shaadi kaa pehla saal hi wo vakt hota he jab couples aapas main baaten share karnaa sikhte hai
 This is where trust is built between the two
 2
 In the first year of marriage, where a new love begins, there are also many battles
 pati-patni donon hi ek-duusare ko samajhane kii koshish karte rahete hanjismen donon ke bich kai baar ladaai-jhagade ho jate hai

 ekbar jab shaadi kaa bandhan bandha jaataa he to do parivaar ek ho jate hai
 In such a situation, it is very important to respect each other's values, traditions and ideas

 You will ask what is special about it? Yes, it is special because Kohli's century is huge in many ways
 or agar unke kariyar graph ko bade itminan se dekhen to yah kahana atishyokti nahin hoga ki bharat ko number chaar (yani sachin tendulkar kii jagah) par ballebaaji karne vaala cricketer mil gaya he
 Just a match earlier, Sachin Tendulkar was playing his last Test cricket for Team India and then the buzz was who would replace him
 or agle hi test main logon ko yah jabaav miltaa dikh rahaa he
 Because Virat has batted at number four and scored a century against South Africa (number one Test team) Sarjamin (johannesburg), facing his fast bowlers
 kyon kohli hi banenge number chaar ke badshahyah to sabhi jaanate hai ki sachin tendulkar adhikanshtah number chaar par ballebaaji kiya karte the
 It was exactly three years ago when Sachin Tendulkar hit a brilliant Test century while batting on South African soil on 19 December 2010
 yah sachin tendulkar ke kariyar kaa 50waan test shatak bhi tha
 In that match, Sachin scored this century while batting at number five but not fourth
 sachin ne iske baad test cricket main keval ek shatak or lagaaya janvari 2011 main
 Now Virat Kohli makes his debut in Indian Test cricket in June 2011 this year
 phir viraat ek ke baad ek paanch shatak lagaate hai
 Like Sachin, the first century on foreign soil and five test centuries till 20-25 Tests were played
 sachin ne apane kariyar ke 9wein test main pehla shatak lagaaya tha to viraat ne 8wein test main
 Both had their first Test century on foreign soil
 sachin ne england ke khilaaf to viraat ne australia ke khilaaf
 Talking about the first five Test centuries, Sachin scored his first five Test centuries in the 9th, 14th, 16th, 19th and 23rd Tests, while Virat has scored the first five Test centuries in the 8th, 10th, 14th, 15th and 21st tests
 
 21 test khilne tak jahaan sachin tendulkar ne 38
 With the help of four centuries and five half-centuries at an average of 60, he had scored 1,158 runs while Virat 43
 68 kii ausat se khel rahe hai or unhone itane hi test maichon main 5 shatakon or 7 ardhashtakon kii madad se 1,354 ran banaaye hai
 That is, Virat's career graph looks very similar to Sachin Tendulkar
 aaj viraat 21 test puraane ho chuke hai or wo bilkul sachin ke nakshe kadam par yaa yun kahen kii ek kadam aage hi chal rahe hai
 So keeping in mind Virat Kohli's performance in ODI cricket, it would not be wrong to say that Virat Kohli has got his foot in Sachin Tendulkar's shoes
 viraat ke shatakon kii kahanedakshin africa ke khilaaf viraat kaa yah pehla shatak he
 Coincidentally, this is also his first Test match against South Africa
 viraat apane 21wein test main centuri laga kar apane shatakon kii sankhya paanch par pahunchaa chuke hai
 And the special thing is that till now Virat has scored a century against all the countries against whom he has played Test matches (except West Indies)
 kariyar kaa 21waan test khel rahe viraat ne sabase zyada aath test australia ke khilaaf khelaa he
 And in this, he twice got his score to three points
 unhone apana pehla test shatak bhi australia ke khilaaf hi lagaaya tha
 The specialty of this century was that it was made on a fast wicket like Adelaide of Australia
 iske alaava wo england, newjiland ke khilaaf bhi shatak laga chuke hai
 Virat, who made his Test debut against the West Indies, has played 6 Test matches against him in which he has not scored a century so far

 Nobody recognizes me there
 
 So i am very happy
 43 varshiya abhinayta swayan ko mahaan abhinayta yaa superstar nahin maanate hai
 Saif says, i don't think I'm a superstar
 
 I'm just a star
 rajesh khanna or amitabh bachchan or anya kai log jinhone mahaan oonchaaiyaan pai hai, ve superstar hai
 i don't think i have achieved anything like that
 main yah avashya sochataa hum ki main safal hum, lekin abhi tak bahut zyada safal nahin hum
 But i would like to see myself very successful

 bijepi se tikat maangane waalon main sabjeewale bhi shaamil hai

 kamalesh kaa kahana he ki unhen ilaake kii samasyaayein pataa hai or agar party ne unki baat maani or tikat diya to is baar wo itihaas banaaengi or ye bhi dikhaa dengi ki ekasbji benchne vaali bhi raajnneeti kar sakati haior parshad kaa chunaav bhi jeet sakati he
 In the desire to become a councilor, not only the security guards, but also the vegetable guards, the security guard standing at the gate is also in the queue of those seeking tickets

 Hundreds of party workers seeking ticket from BJP have been waiting to meet from district presidents to state presidents for many months

 But they have not got the confidence of whether they will get the ticket yet

 ganatantr diwas ke maukey par srinagar ke laalchowk par tirangaa fahraane kii bhaajapa kii yojana ke bich pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha ki is pavitra maukey par raajnneeti nahin honi chahie
 This is the first time a statement has been made by the Prime Minister on this matter
 is par bhaajapa ne singh par palatwaar karte hue kaha he ki pradhanmantri desh ko nicha dikhaa rahe hai or unka bayaan algaavvaadiyon kaa hausala badhaane vaala he
 The purpose of the Rashtriya Ekta Yatra launched by the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha is to unfurl the tricolor on January 26 at Lal Chowk

 The Prime Minister said in his statement that peace should not be disturbed in a sensitive state like Jammu and Kashmir
 singh ne kaha, main ummid karata hum ki sabhi naagarik or raajnneetik dal is aahvaan ko maanenge or aisa kuch bhi nahin karenge, jisase shanti or sauhardra main vyavdhaan utpann ho yaa ganatantr diwas kii garima ko koi chot pahunche
 Describing the Republic Day as a holy occasion, Singh said, "this is not a chance to take political advantage, embarrass the government or local administration, create problems without reason or pursue a disruptive agenda
" unhone kaha, isse bhi jaruri he ki jammu-kashmir jaise samvedansheel rajya par adhiktam sanyam bartaa jaae
 The Prime Minister did not name anyone, but he meant the unity visit of the BJP, under which the party is scheduled to hoist the tricolor at Lal Chowk in Srinagar on Republic Day
 bhaajapa pravaktaa rajeev pratan rudi ne kaha, ham pradhanmantri se jaananaa chaahate hai ki desh ke kise hisse main tirange ko salaam karnaa deshadroh he? is tarah ke bayaan dekar pradhanmantri algaavvaadiyon kaa hausala badha rahe hai
 Seats have been split in the Samajwadi party-bahujan Samaj Party (SP-BSP), which has formed an alliance in Uttar Pradesh for the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 donon dal 75 siton par ladenge jisamen basapa 38 siton par or sapa 37 siton par ladegi
 Out of the remaining 5 seats, 3 seats have been given to Ajit Singh's party Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD)
 amethi or raibareli seat se gathbandhan nahin ladega or ye do siten congress ke liye chodi gai hai
 The BSP has got maximum seats in western Uttar Pradesh, while the majority of seats in eastern and Awadh region have come in the sp's share
 basapa kii mukhya siten bijanour, meerut, aligarh, agra, shahjahanpur, pratapgarh, farrukhabad, sitapur, bulandshahr, gautam buddhanagar hai
 Some of the main seats of SP are Lucknow, Kanpur, Jhansi, Ghaziabad, Moradabad, Rampur, Kairana, Phulpur, Faizabad, Allahabad
 uttar pradesh kaa raajnneetik akalan:-uttar pradesh main 2017 main hue pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne apana dal (es) or suhel bhartiya janata party (esbspi) ke saath milakar 325 siton par jeet darj kii, jisamen 312 siten sirf bhaajapa kii thi
 But now the situation is such that Apna Dal (S) is ready to pull out of BJP
 sapa 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main 5 siton par simat gai thi saath hi 2017 main sarkaar bhi gavaan di
 The BSP had a worse situation
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main 19
 Even after getting 6 per cent votes, the BSP could not even open its account in the sixteenth Lok Sabha, although the two parties, the SP-BSP, have maintained a separate presence in their time
 lekin vartmaan raajnneetik paristhitiyon main apni haisiyat barkaraar rakhane main bhi naakaam rahi
 This is the reason that the two parties were forced to forge an alliance
 dekha jaae to 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main sapa kaa vot share 22
 2 percent and bsp's 19
 6 fisadi
 Significantly, if both of them fought together in 2014, the vote share of both was 41
 80 fisadi hota
 With which both these parties could retain their position as bjp's vote share 42
 30 fisadi rahaa
 Uttar Pradesh has 80 Lok Sabha seats, of which the BJP won 71 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 vartmaan main bhaajapa ke paas 68 siten hai kyonki beete varsh 2018 main hue teen upachunaavon main bhaajapa vipakshi gathbandhan ke kaaran apni teen siten phulpur, kairana, or gorakhpur se haath dho baithi
 Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state
 isliye yahaan kii raajnneeti bhi kshetron ke hisaab se vibhinn he
 According to data from the Center for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), Uttar Pradesh has been divided into 6 constituencies
 purvanchal main kul 30 siton main bhaajapa ne 41
 With 2 percent votes, it won 29 seats while the SP-BSP won 22
 0 fisadi or 20
 Did not achieve anything even by getting 6% votes
 pashchimi uttar pradesh (braj) main 9 siton main bhaajapa ko 50
 2% of the votes were received and all 9 seats were in its share
 jabaki sapa-basapa or congress kaa kul milakar 46
 The vote share was 1 percent but the seats remained zero
 rohelkhand kii 10 siton par bhi bhaajapa kii jholii main 9 siten ai or vot share 42
 It was 6 percent
 sapa ke varisht netaa aazam khan ne rampur seat par jeet kar apana prabhutv kaayam rakhaa
 In Awadh, the BJP won 11 of the 13 seats, including the capital Lucknow
 9 fisadi vot share ke saath apane naam kii
 While the Congress won both its traditional seats in Amethi and Rae Bareli
 amethi se rahul gandhi or raibareli se sonia gandhi ne chunaav ladaa tha
 There are a total of 14 seats in Doab, of which SP has 25
 2 fisadi vot share hone ke baavjood 3 siten hasil kii jabaki bhaajapa 46
 Won 11 seats with 1 percent vote share
 bundelkhand main vaise to chaar loksabhaa siten hoti hai or chaaron hi siton par bhaajapa ne apana paracham laharaaya
 The Congress does not want to leave any effort on its part
 or usne pashchimi upi main jyotiraditya sindhiya or purvi upi kii kaman priyanka gandhi ko dekar masterstroke khelaa he
 The BJP has also fielded its star campaigners Narendra Modi, Yogi Adityanath, Amit Shah and other big leaders, while the SP-BSP and RLD are preparing vigorously under the leadership of Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati and Ajit Singh
 itnaa tay he ki gathbandhanon or seat bantwaare ko lekar uttar pradesh main loksabhaa chunaav bahut dilachasp or rangeen hone vaala he
 The equation of statistics is currently saying that if SP-BAPSA were together in 2014, this alliance could have given a fight to BJP despite Modi wave
 bhaajapa ne uttar pradesh main hue 2014 loksabhaa or 2017 vidhansabha chunaav main apana adhiktam paa liya he to sawaal yah he ki 2019 main us sarvocch shikhar ko vah kaise barkaraar rakh sakati he
 This is also the question of Uttar Pradesh and the main basis of the bjp's strategy

 The entire family and the people of the neighborhood are also in shock due to Miley's death
 padosiyon ne bataaya ki mili kii maa beeti raat bill ke ghar ke baahar roti-cheekhti rahi
 Miley used to call her mother 'little angel'
 aaropee bill ke bare main haalanki uske padosiyon or doston ne kisi tarah kii sashankit karne vaali baat nahin bataai
 When Bill's social media accounts were investigated, it was found out that he had got the job of decorating a house this year, which he was still doing
