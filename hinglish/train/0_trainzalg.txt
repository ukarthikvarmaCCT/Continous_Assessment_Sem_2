 Indian Railways is preparing to make a major change in premium trains like Rajdhani and Duronto
 iske tahat sarkaar kuch premium trainon main asi-tu tear class ko asi-thri tear class se badal sakati he
 Through this change, the government not only wants to reduce the growing crowd in the AC-3 tier class, but the people will also get relief on the fare front
 darasal railway kipremium trenonko airlines se kadi takkar mil rahi he
 Where ac-to-tier class ticket fares in other premium trains including Rajdhani reach around Rs 5000
 vahiin, kai airline kuch root par takreeban 4 hajaar rupee tak main tikat de rahi hai
 The second reason, due to which the government can make this change in some premium trains, is that most of the time, bookings are more in ac-three tier class
 isse bheed bad jaati he, lekin asi-tu tear class main aisa nahin ho paata he
 According to a report by Indian Express, in view of these two challenges, Indian Railways may replace AC-2 to AC-3 in some premium trains
 isse na sirf railway airline ko takkar dene main safal hona chaahati he, balki isse aam aadmi ko bhi kam paise kharch karne padenge
 Please tell that at present, flexi fair system is applicable in many premium trains including Rajdhani
 isse bhartiya railway kii kamai to badi he, lekin isaki vajah se asi-2 kaa kiraaya kai baar airline ke kiraaye se bhi zyada ho jaataa he
 What is 'flexi' fare math? Under this system 10% of the seats available in all these trains are booked on the original fare
 yani agar kisi jagah kaa mul kiraaya 100 rupee he to pehle 10 fisadi tikat 100 rupee ke base price par book honge
 After booking 10 per cent seats, the next 10 per cent tickets of Rajdhani and Durant will be booked on the basis of Rs 110
 iske baad agle 20 fisadi tikat kii booking ke baad agle 10 fisadi tikat 120 rupee par book hogen
 After 30 per cent tickets are booked, the next 10 per cent tickets will be booked at Rs 130
 isi tarah40 fisadi tikatbook hone ke baad agle 10 fisadi tikat kii booking 140 rupee ke dar par hogi

 The Congress leaders are in a position to lose two consecutive elections

 On the question of the opposition gaining power, Modi said that criticism is the beauty of democracy
 main maanata hum ki modi sarkaar kii bharpoor aalochana honi chahie
 Democracy thrives through criticism
 or sarkaron ko bhi satark rakhti he
 So if anyone criticizes, i consider it good luck
 lekin aalochana karne ke liye bahut mehnat kerani padati he, ab aaj aisi apadhapi kaa samay he ki logon ke paas hi nahin he
 People have learned to accuse rather than criticize
 ye swasth loktantr ke liye khatarnaak he
 There should be criticism but avoid the allegations
 main hameshaa aalochana kaa swaagat karata hum
 Many people have made me
 logon kii mehnat ko main mitti main nahin milane duungaa
 - How do you remember history? On this question, Modi said that one remembers who wrote the Vedas
 duniya ke sabase puraane granth
 If nobody remembers the name of such a great author, then what is Modi
 itani si choti cheez he
 Modi is not born to make his place in history
 mujhe sava sau karod bharatiyon kii tarah hi yaad rakhaa jaae
 Like other people, i have also got work
 makasad he to meraa desh ajar amar he
 If you remember the world, remember my country
 meraa desh hi duniya ko vishwa kalyaan kaa rasta dikhaa saktaa he
 On the question of New India and New World Order, Modi said that people sitting here today will feel that the strength of your passport has increased or not
 aapke prati log garv ke saath dekhte hai ki nahin
 Hindustan was there earlier too, but now change is felt or not
 aaj puure vishwa main bharat ko loha mana jaataa he
 India behaved balanced by its policies
 bharat ne sabko khush karne kii ranneeti chhod di he
 We decided when we should go to Palestine and when to go to Israel
 main saudi arabia bhi jaaoongaa or desh kii security ke jaruri he, to main iran bhi jaaoongaa
 - Modi said that you can imagine that there was no UAE for 23 years
 koun roktaa tha aapako, aaj vishwa ke sabhi deshon ke saath, meri aalochana hoti thi ki modi, chaay bechney vaala videsh niti kya samajhegaa, lekin aaj chaar saal ke baad koi ye sawaal nahin uthaa saktaa he
 The reason for this is not that there are 125 crore Indians behind Modi
 mujhe vishwaas he ki main duniya ko bharat kaa satya samajha saktaa hum
 Prince Charles came to India personally inviting me, he wrote me a letter in private
 bharat ne apane vyavhaar ke dwaara kisi bhi bhedbhaav ke bina, duniya ke kisi bhi desh ke saath bharat ne na kisi ke saath aankh jhukaakar baat kii or na kisi ke saath aankh uthaakar kii, balki aankh milakar baat kii
 Today India has emerged as a global leader
 bharat apana profile ek nae vishwaas ke saath paidaa kar rahaa he
 - You have to remember the condition the country was in
 2001 main main pehali baar siem bana
 i never went to the police station, did not go to the government office
 maine shapath nahin lee thi
 People started coming to meet
 log kehete the ki or kuch karo na bas raat ko khate samay bijli mili, itnaa kar dena
 i worked for 2-3 years and Gujarat became the first state in the country where 24 hours of electricity was available
 log bhul gaye ki andhera kaisaa hota he
 My criticism is not because you do nothing, it is because you can, but you do nothing
 - bahut puraani meri kavita he
 i do not remember poetry
 ramata ram akelaa naam se meri kavita he
 i will put it on social media
 fakiri man kii avasthaa se judaa he
 It does not come from injecting, conditions do not cause it
 ye inbilt hota he
 i am not praising myself, but it is necessary to tell
 jab main gujarat main siem tha to mujhe log kabhi painting, kabhi talwaar, kabhi murti de dete the
 Everyone would have felt that putting them in the house, but i used to put them in the treasury of the government
 phir maine uski nilaamee karwaai
 - He said that there are many people in the government whom people say took so much
 main garv se kahata hum ki main aisa siem tha jo bacchiyon kii shiksha ke liye 100 karod se zyada rupee dekar aayaa tha
 When people started pushing me and sending me to Delhi, i called the officers
 vidhayak hone ke naate paise milte the, ve bhi pade hue the
 - Modi said that i do not remember, it was probably 5-6 lakh rupees, i said that in the secretariat of Gandhinagar, the children of driver and peon continue to get money from interest
 mere afasar chupchaap sunate rahe
 Officers are very skilled, shaking the mundi
 do din baad unhone kaha ki ve mere ghar aana chaahate hai
 He said that you do not do this, do you know when you need the money
 unhone mujhe paise dene nahin die, bahut samajhane par maan gaye
 Created a fund and i came into it with money
 - main auliya hum
 i have grown up in such a situation that nothing affects me
 - urja kaa raaj ke bare main unhone kaha ki main pichley do dashak se roj ek kilo- do kilo gaaliyaan khaataa hum
 Is an old phenomenon
 koi tirthasthan tha
 There was a mountain, saints used to sit in the Terai
 ek aath saal kii bacchee apane teen saal ke bhai ko lekar chadh rahi thi
 The saint asked whether you are not feeling tired, so he said that this is my brother
 - modi ne kaha ki sant ne kaha ki main tera rishta nahin puch rahaa hum to ladki ne phir kaha ki yah to meraa bhai he
 When the saint asked this for the third time, the girl again said that this is my brother and the brother does not feel tired
 sava sau karod deshvasi mere bhai hai
 - Where did this fakery come from? In response to this question, Modi said that this is a very personal question
 unhone kaha ki mujhe apni kavita yaad nahin he
 But i will put him on social media
 ye fakiri man kii avasthaa he
 These situations do not create that
 ye inbilt hota he
 When i was in Gujarat, people used to give gifts at public functions
 kuch na kuch
 
 
 i am also human meraa bhi man karata he
 Will it not? The applause rang but Modi said that i did not feel like it
 main use koshagaar main de detaa tha
 - Modi said that before coming to Delhi, i called the officers and said that i have money, he has drivers and peons in the secretariat of Gandhinagar, be given to him
 jo afasar sun rahe the, wo mundi hilaa rahe the
 After two days, he got the message that he wants to meet at home, he said that sir, do not do this
 kab aapako paise kii jarurat pad jaae
 i said what will i do by taking it
 lekin ek chota sa foundation banaaya or uske liye choti si raashi dekar nikal liya
 Nothing affects me
 - obama care or modicare ke bare main ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki teen baton par meraa jor rahaa he
 i don't talk big bacchon ko padhai, yuva ko kamai, bujurg ko dawaai
 These are the things that should happen for a healthy society
 achche khaase parivaar main bhi agar ek beemaari aa jaae to sabhi yojanaayen, beti kii shaadi kii taiyaari dhari kii dhari rah jaati he
 When the auto rickshaw driver becomes ill, the whole family becomes ill
 - unhone kaha ki ayushmaan bharat main ham desh main kareeb dedh lakh se zyada welnes centre bananaa chaahate hai
 12-15 villages benefited from one center
 doosraa- yoga, poshan mishan se priventive health ko bal mili
 Many countries of the world do not have the same leniency for maternity leave as we have here
 hamane 26 hafte kaa avkaash diya he
 The government will provide insurance of up to 5 lakh rupees to half the population of India i
e
 50 lakh people
 tear-tu or thri city main achche privet aspataalon kaa network khadaa hoga
 a new chain will be formed
 1 hajaar se zyada achche or nae aspataal banane kii sambhaavna he
 Meanwhile, Prasoon Joshi recited a poem for Narendra Modi and people cheered him with applause
 is par modi ne kaha ki hamaara bhav rahaa he ki ahan amritasya
 
 
 And it is the passion that they are committed to take the country to new heights
 - unhone kaha ki garibi naare se nahin mitati he, maine tay kiya he ki 4 karod pariwaron tak bijli pahunchaaungaa
 And this has to be done
 - modi ne kaha ki main mehnat karata hum or is par desh main koi vivaad nahin he
 i have capital mere paas sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kaa pyaar he
 That is why i should work as much as possible
 mujhe deshavaasiyon se kahana chahie ki main bhi aapke jaisaa saamaanya naagarik hum
 i have many shortcomings
 kripaya karke mujhe alag na samajho
 - The Prime Minister said - i have a student inside
 maine use kabhi marane nahin diya
 And the obligation i get
 use seekhney kii koshish karata hum
 i do not have experience
 mujhase galtiyaan ho sakati hai, lekin bad iraade se galat kabhi nahin karuunga
 Worked as Chief Minister for a long time
 pradhansevak kaa tamgaa mujhe mila he
 But i will not do anything with the wrong intention, i never thought that i will change the country
 lekin sochataa hum ki agar desh main lakhon samasyaayein hai, to sava sau karod samaadhaan hai
 Referring to demonetisation, Modi said that i have experienced demonetisation, the President of Argentina told me that my friend went
 main apni patni se aisi charchaa kar rahaa tha
 There is a constant attack on the TV screen against the government, but the countrymen believed that my country is fighting for honesty
 meraa saamaanya naagarik eemaandaaree ke liye jujh rahaa he
 The result of that is that Modi needs whatever result he has today
 kisi ko gaali dena he, to kisko denge
 i consider myself lucky that all the stones are killing me
 deshavaasiyon par koi pathar nahin pad rahaa he
 - i ever wrote — people who throw stones at me
 main usee pattharon se patthi bana detaa hunor us par chalakar aage badhata hum- prasoon joshi ne poocha ki pehali baar kisi pradhanmantri ne toilet kii baat kii
 These priorities have changed
 ye kis tarah dyside karte hai
 On this, Modi said that i would not say that no government was focused on these subjects
 ye unke saath nyaay nahin hoga
 But i believe what is the reason that there are so many plans
 mahatma gandhi ne ek siddhant diya tha ki koi bhi niti banaae to is taraazoo par taule ki uskaa samaaj ke aakhri aadmi par kya prabhaav he
 Speaking on the rape case, Narendra Modi also referred to the victim of Kathua and said that the allegations should not be transcribed
 ek beti ke saath atyaachaar kaise sahan kar sakate hai
 i told the Red Fort why the questioning of daughters does not question sons
 beti ke saath jaghanya aparaadh karne vaala bhi kisi kaa betaa hi he
 Even after independence in India, sanitation was up to 30-40 percent
 mujhe kitaab padhakar garibi seekhni nahin he
 i have come to live that life
 garibi kya hoti he, pichhadaapan kya hota he
 - He said that politics is in its place
 meri niti kahati he ki inaki jindagi main kuch to badlaav laaun main, 18 hajaar gaanvon main hamane bijli pahunchaai, or ye jimmedaari hamen leni hogi
 The officers said that this work may take seven years, i said that it will be completed in a thousand days
 aap kalpana kar sakate hai ki garib maa shauchalay jane ke liye suraj dhalane kaa intjaar karti he
 Think how much pain a mother must have
 ye sawaal hamen sone nahin dete hai
 - Modi said that Lord Ramachandra and Laxman have a dialogue while leaving Lanka, we learn from that
 lekin kisi kaa yuddh ladane kaa saahas na ho, peeth par waar karata ho to ye modi he, usee kii bhashaa main jawaab dena jaanata he
 - They said that our soldiers slept in tents, they put them to death

 The plan that was made, it was implemented 100 percent correctly and returned before the sunrise
 - modi ne kaha ki hamaari nekaniyati dekhie ki maine hamaare adhikariyon se kaha ki media ko pataa chale isse pehle, pakistaniyon ko bataa den ki vahaan aapaki laashen padi hai, jaakar uthaa lijie

 Priyanka Verma of Delhi has asked the question through the video, why do we choose the government
 jab se aap aae hai, to sabase system kaaphi badal gaya he
 My question is why do we choose the government, and why did it not happen before
 iske jawaab main modi ne kaha ki desh kii aazaadee ke liye lakhon logon ne balidaan diya he
 The struggle for independence was not stopped in any corner of the country
 lekin mahatma gandhi ne ise andolan kaa rup diya
 Hired every man
 mahatma gandhi ne aazaadee ko andolan main parivartit kar diya
 People believed that freedom can be obtained from it
 - unhone kaha ki desh ke liye mar mitane waalon kii kami nahin thi, lekin gandhi ji ne ek saath hindustan ke kone-kone main logon ko khadaa kar diya
 Modi hoped that development should also be turned into a mass movement
 sab kuch sarkaar nahin karegi
 After independence, there was an atmosphere that the government would do everything
 isse kya hua ki sarkaar or janata ke bich duuri bad gai
 a man traveling alone in a bus keeps pulling seats, when he comes to know that the bus belongs to him, he will not do so
 sarkaar theke kaa kaam nahin he
 This is the work of public participation
 - prakritik aapadaaon ke samay sarkaar se zyada janata janardan kaam karti he
 The more the public participates in democracy
 kaam hoga
 Look at the campaign for building toilets
 railway main varisht ko milane vaali chhot par logon ne jabardast respance mila he
 More than 40 lakh senior people have refused in writing to take subsidy
 agar main kanuunan karata to aisa nahin hota, balki virodh hota, popularity reating aati or bataaya jaataa ki modi gir gaya
 Targeting the Congress, he said that elections are fought in the country on gas cylinders, but we appealed and people gave up subsidies
 hamaara kaam desh ke samarthy ko samajhane kii he
 We have to run the country not the government
 janata hi shakti he
 Have to take them
 - ek sawaal ke jawaab main modi ne kaha ki jab mere bheetar se besabri khatm ho jaaegi, us din main desh ke kisi kaam kaa nahin rahoonga
 Every day i wake up with a new dream for the country
 mere deshavaasiyon ko mujh par bharosa he
 And we go with the cause of the common people, the happiness of all the people
 kuch logon ko lagata he ki chodo yaar kuch badal nahin saktaa he
 But i am a different kind of person
 - unhone kaha ki main kabhi aadhe bhare hue gilaas kaa udhaaharan detaa tha
 i will use this platform to criticize another government, but the decision process has changed in this government as compared to the previous government
 usee vyavastha main spasht niti or sabake hit main aap icchit parinaam le sakate hai
 It is not that what i want will be there, if it does not happen, then i am not disappointed
 - twitor par prashanth dikshit ke sawaal ko prasoon joshi ne uthaate hue kaha ki deshvasi main vikaas ko lekar besabri he
 In response, Modi said that eagerly is the identity of youth
 main ise bura nahin maanata
 He said that the countrymen are confident, so they are expected
 - PM bole- loktantr main janata ishwar kaa rup, tu hi tu ke siddhant par jeeta hum
 The country is benefited only by its own spending
 desh ke saath nyaay apane aapako mitaa dene se hota he
 - Prime Minister Modi said that democracy is like Janata Janardan Ishwar
 ek baar faisla kar le, to sab badal saktaa he
 Because the place in India was safe for a family, it was replaced by Janata Janardhana

 centre sarkaar main shaamil hone kaa ofer thukaraane ke baad nitish kumaar ab bihar sarkaar kaa vistaar karne ja rahe hai
 Nitish will expand his cabinet on Sunday
 kuch nae logon ko mantrimandal main shaamil kiya jaayegaa

 Nitish was upset about the fact that the Akali Dal, which has two parliaments, he and Paswan, who have six parliaments, were also made one cabinet minister each, while his party JDU has 16 parliaments and the same space for it
 Placed in the cabinet
 nitish kumaar ke ek cabinet ke pad ke nyote ko na maanane ke peeche kai kaaran hai
 The main reason among them is the resentment of the parliaments in his own party
 lekin isse bhi zyada nitish kumaar us formula se pareshaan hai jisamen bhaajapa koi nirnay lekar sahyogiyon par thopane kii niti par chalane lagi he
 If the same formula is repeated especially in Bihar assembly elections in future, then they may have to take it
 isliye mantrimandal main shaamil na hone kaa faisla saarvajanik kar nitish kumaar ne bhaajapa ko saafe-saafe sanket de diya ki unke upar bhaajapa kaa nirnay maanane kii koi baadhyataa nahin he

 bharat or pakistan ke bich or adhik dwipaksheeya shrunkhalaaon ke mudde par jawaab dene se bachate hue dhoni ne kaha, pakistan ke khilaaf match kahin bhi ho yah vishesh hota he
 In the last one and a half years, the matches between the two teams have seen a very soft attitude
 maidan par kabhi-kabhaar hi koi ghatana hoti he
 Matches against Pakistan, however, depend on the BCCI
 ham to sainik hai, bisisiai hamen jahaan bhejega ham vahaan chale jaaenge
 The Indian captain, however, once again emphasized the need for a competent all-rounder in the team
 dhoni ne kaha, niyamon main badlaav ke kaaran hamen ek achche olerounder kii jarurat he, jo gendbaaji or ballebaaji donon kar sake
 Apart from Irfan Pathan, we have no real all-rounder
 bhubaneshwar ne acchhee gendbaaji kii, lekin use olerounder banane ke liye ballebaaji main bhi yogadan dena hoga
 He will have to improve on this side of his game
 unhone kaha, vah praveen kumaar kii tarah kaa gendbaaj he
 When Praveen came, he used to bowl at a speed of 135 km per hour and perhaps Bhubaneswar has the same speed, but he is a very sensible bowler
 kul milakar usamen abhi sudhaar kii gunjaaish he
 Dhoni said, i can only speak in defense of the batsmen that today we have scored as many runs as were necessary
 hamen isse adhik score bananaa chahie tha
 After losing wickets in the beginning, we also lost a lot of wickets in the middle overs
 ham 220
 
 225 ran bana sakate the
 "our team depends heavily on the openers, so a good start is very important
" haalanki jis mausam main match ho rahe hai usamen tej gendbaajon ko madad milti he or pakistan kaa gendbaaji akraman kaaphi acha he
 When the Indian captain was asked if the score of 167 was enough, he said, "we knew that around 168 runs would not be enough
" hamane faisla kiya ki ham scoreboard kii taraf nahin dekhenge, jisase madad mili
 The bowlers bowled quite disciplined
 aise samay main tej gendbaaj kaaphi prayog karne kii koshish karte hai or short gend phenkate hai, lekin is match main unhone ek jagah par gendbaaji kii
 On not feeding Sehwag in this match, Dhoni said that this change was made on the last moments
 unhone kaha, antim ekadash main yah badlaav antim lamhon main kiya gaya
 Sometimes some things are not in your hands
 dhoni ne england ke khilaaf paanch maichon kii ekadivasiy shrunkhlaa se purv is match main mili jeet ko ahm bataaya
 The comments unhone kaha, is tarah kii jeet kaaphi ahm hoti he
 This helps in creating rhythm
 jab log aapako nakaar dete hai tab is tarah kii jeet se prerana milti he
 Describing the effort of the entire team as important in the good performance of the team, Dhoni said, "I am not expecting anyone to win the team by scoring 100 or 150 runs or big centuries
" main chahta hum ki yogadan diya jaae
 Players contribute around 45 and 80 to 90 runs will be good
 yuvaraj singh kii jagah gendbaaji main ravindra jadeja ko mauka die jane ke faisle kaa bachaav karte hue dhoni ne kaha, paanch kshetrarakshakon ko 30 gaj ke ghere main rakhane ke nae niyam se hamen kuch saamanjasy bithaane pad rahe hai
 Yuvi will take time to get accustomed to these rules and we want to give him time, because you have to bowl at midwicket or deep midwicket and it is not easy
 jadeja ko ballebaaji main ravichandran aswin se neeche bheja gaya or is par bhartiya captain ne kaha, agar aswin or mere bich acchhee saajhedaari ho jaati to jadeja antim overon main teji se ran bator saktaa tha, jabaki aswin ke liye slog karnaa aasaan nahin hota, isi ko dhyaan main rakhte hue hamane yah faisla kiya tha
 Avoiding answering on the issue of more bilateral series between India and Pakistan, Dhoni said, "it is special wherever the match against Pakistan is
 pichley dedh saal main donon tiimon ke bich hue muqablon main kaaphi naram rukh dekhne ko mila he
 Sometimes an incident happens on the field
 pakistan ke khilaaf match haalanki bisisiai par nirbhar karte hai
 We are soldiers, we will go where the BCCI sends us
 bhartiya captain ne haalanki ek baar phir team main sakasham olerounder kii jarurat par jor diya
 Dhoni said, due to the change in rules, we need a good all-rounder who can do both bowling and batting
 irfan pathan ke alaava hamaare paas koi vaastavik olerounder nahin he
 Bhuvneshwar bowled well, but he would also have to contribute in batting to become an all-rounder
 use apane khel ke is paksh main sudhaar karnaa hoga
 He said, he is a bowler like Praveen Kumar
 jab praveen aayaa tha to 135 kimi prati ghanta kii raftaar se gendbiji karata tha or shaayad bhubaneshwar kii raftaar bhi itani he, lekin vah kaaphi samajhadaar gendbaaj he
 Overall, there is room for improvement

 yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh montek singh ahaluwalia ne somvaar ko kaha ki desh main vibhinn pariyojnaon ke liye manjuuri prakriya main sudhaar kii jarurat he
 In an interview with a TV channel, Ahluwalia said that it (transparency) always needs to be increased, and as far as i believe it has not been much in the past
 meraa maananaa he ki chaahe aap ise paardarshita kahen yaa phir dakshata kahen, system main kaaphi kuch sudhaar kii jarurat he
 He said, Montek Singh Ahluwalia is in favor of a more effective environmental protection scheme in the country, but the situation should already be very clear and transparent about it
 unhone kaha ki paryaavaran manjuuri ke maamle main puraane samay main pranali zyada paardarshee nahin thi or na hi iskaa kriyanvayan prabhavi rahaa he
 He said, i believe that in future we should adopt complete transparency in this area
 ahaluwalia ne kaha ki ek aisi sthapit pranali honi chaiye jisamen kuch nishchit avadhi main paryaavaran niyamon ke paalan ke maamle main udyogon kii nigaraanee honi chahie
 Due to the environment ministry's constraints on projects, the Planning Commission Deputy Chairman had earlier criticized Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh saying that a definite definition should be made in the matter of prohibition of mining projects
 iske jo bhi maandand tay hon uske peeche vaigyanik aadhaar hona chahie
 However, he also stressed that there should be flexibility

 He said that in the name of development, the bjp-led NDA government had sought votes from the people, if it (BJP government) had done its job properly then it would not have to adopt its old communal playing cards
 shabana ne kaha ki hamaari sabase bady shakti ‘samvidhan' he or use bachaane ke liye kanhaiya ke paksh main vot karen taaki vah sansad main garibon kii aawaaj uthaa sake
 He said that Kanhaiya is constantly being accused of treason and being a part of the tukde-tukde gang because there is a danger to those people that Kanhaiya has truly won your (people's) heart and will reach Parliament
 chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karte hue dakshin bharat ke mashhoor abhinayta prakaash raaj ne kaha ki kanhaiya mujhase umr main chota he par soch main bada he

 In a single day on Thursday, 60 new cases of swine flu were registered in Gujarat and nine people died
 isi ke saath gujarat main is saal kii shuruyaat se ab tak swine flu se marane waalon kii sankhya 62 ho gai he
 Due to this, there is an atmosphere of fear of swine flu among the people, while the government is also very worried
 aakhirkaar gujarat main swine flu ke maamalon ke anupaat main mauton kii sankhya bahut zyaada he
 At the national level, there have been 72 deaths in Rajasthan and 41 deaths in Telangana as compared to 62 in Gujarat, but survival rate, ie the probability of survival is the lowest in Gujarat
 agar swine flu ho to gujarat main bachane kii sambhaavna 13 pratishat he, jabaki yah rajasthan main 17 or maharashtra main 34 pratishat he
 Due to this, the Union Health Ministry had also sent a team to Gujarat recently, which after investigation said that the reason for more deaths in Gujarat is that people are late to know that they have swine flu
 is vajah se ve der se aspataal jate hai, or tab tak unhen neumonia zyaada ho chukaa hota he, tathaa saans kii samasya bhi ho chuki hoti he, or isi vajah se unhen bachaana behad mushkil ho jaataa he
 That is why the government in Gujarat is now taking steps
 lagaataar radio, sthaneey television channelon or akhbaaron ke jariye vigyaapan dekar logon ko jaagruk banane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 It is being said that for any type of cold, cough and fever, it should be checked in a government hospital

 In fact, Samajwadi Party leaders do not see much benefit from this merger
 unhen lagata he ki jediu or argedy kii takat bihar tak simit he
 So the party has not been very enthusiastic about the merger, but the RJD and jdu's conciliatory attitude towards the party symbol and name has made the path easier for the merger

 shashikala natarajan 1980 ke dashak se hi jayalalita kii vishwast sahyogi raheen lekin kabhi bhi sarkaar yaa party main kisi pad par nahin raheen
 It was because of Jayalalithaa's long association that she was considered a center of power
 ullekhneey he ki shashikala or panniraselvam ek hi samudaay se taalluk rakhte hai or shashikala ke samarthan se vah jayalalita ke sabase mahatvapurn sahyogi banakar ubhare
 Sasikala Natarajan has been a trusted aide of Jayalalithaa since the 1980s but never held any position in the government or the party
 jayalalita ke lambey saath kii vajah se hi unako satta kaa ek centre mana jaataa rahaa
 It is noteworthy that Sasikala and Panneerselvam belong to the same community and with Sasikala's support, he emerged as the most important ally of Jayalalithaa
 congress or bijepi donon hi partiyon ne chunaav main videshi company se chanda lene ke hycourt ke faisle ko supreme court main chunauti di he or yah maamla vahaan chal hi rahaa he
 Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioners in the Supreme Court, says that in every hearing, the government seeks more reasons from the court and the case is deferred
 ab (bajet main prastaavit sanshodhan aane se) ye saaf ho gaya he ki sarkaar is maamle main vakt kyon maang rahi he
 Significantly, in the petition filed in the Supreme Court in this case, Swamy alleged that the then Finance Minister p Chidambaram approved the Aircel Maxis deal without the permission of the Cabinet Committee, whereas the deal was worth 3500 crores
 niyamon ke mutabik, vittamantri 600 karod rupee tak kii deal ko hi manjuuri de sakate the
 The FIPB sent the file to the Finance Minister and they approved it
 lekin, sijeai ne kaha ki isse pehle ki koi notice jari kiya jaae, yachikakarta ko pehle court ko pratham drushtya saboot material ke taur par pesh karne honge

 Rim India Managing Director Sunil Dutt said, “rim Enterprise Equipment as a brand has become a consumer appliance

 In such a situation, we want that our handsets are visible in more and more hands, hence the price is being cut

 Waving saffron
 bhagava pahane aath hajaar sant
 And only the voice of Ram temple
 elahabaad main sangam sthal par mahakumbh kaa yah najaara sirf santon kaa ho, aisa bhi nahin he
 In this, along with the saints, there is such a solution of politics and Sangh Parivar, which is visible after 24 years
 1989 main kuch isi tarah kendriya maardarshak mandal ne us samay ve
 P
 singh sarkaar ko chaar maheene kaa vakt diya tha or uske baad car seva kaa jo khel babari masjid ko dhahaane ke saath khatm hua, uskaa najaara samoochee duniya ne dekha
 This time there is no Babri Masjid but the confluence of saints, Sangh Parivar and politics is the same
 sant ram mandir ko lekar samskruti kaa sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 The Sangh Parivar is exploring the country's identity in the Ram temple
 or bijepi siyasat ke liye us bhagava jameen ko talash rahi he, jahaan par khadey hokar 2014 ke liye sattashin hone kaa rasta nikal aae
 That is, all three are looking for a way
 lekin yah rasta sirf mishan 2014 ke liye ho yaa mishan 2014 ko bhi apane raste kaa ek padaav bhar maan le, antarvirodh iskaa bhi he
 For the first time in the Parliament of Parliament, Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, in the same gesture, called Narendra Modi a hero and also showed him the dream of handing over power to the temple builders by standing on the ground of Hindutva
 unhone kaha, “jo mandir banayega, satta usee ko milegi
 Will remain in power, who will build the temple
 ” yani sawaal ab yah nahin he ki bijepi ke bheetar mache ghamaasan se sangh ko jujhna he
 The question is whether the BJP now entangles the Sangh under its politics or puts its politics in the palm of the Sangh
 jis vakt bijepi adhyaksh sangam main dubkee lagaakar santon ke bich ram mandir kaa aviral paath pard rahe the, usee vakt bijepi ke sabase lokapriy netaa narendra modi dilli main yuvaaon ko vikaas kaa paath padhaa rahe the
 When the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) patron president Ashok Singhal was comparing Modi to Nehru, its executive president Pravin Togadia was drawing a Lakshman Rekha among saints where no one would even name it
 udhar dilli main modi chah karod gujaratiyon ke vikaas kii duhai de rahe the, tabhi maardarshak mandal main togdipha 15 karod yuvaaon ko ram mandir andolan se jodgaye kaa aahvaan kar rahe the
 It is also important to understand such a need for BJP or part of the Sangh's strategy
 rajnath agar ram mandir kaa jaap karte hai or modi vikaas kaa sawaal khadaa kar yuvaaon ko chetate hai ki ve vot bank kii siyasat main na fansen to phir hindutv yaa ram mandir kaa mudda is baar itnaa saral nahin he
 Rajnath reached the Sangam to seek blessings from the saints and the Sangha
 lekin maujuuda halaat main siyasat karte modi akele swayamsevak hai jo sangh ke prachaarak hai
 And for the first time in the Sangh Parivar is happy about the fact that one of his campaigners is not only politically heavy on all the politicians of the country but has also met the criteria of public popularity
 modi kii tarah prachaarkon kii fehrist main na to atal bihari vaajapeyi rahe or na hi laalkrishna adwani
 At present, if we look at the list of Sangh pracharaks politically, only three names will be in mind: K
 en
 Govindacharya, Madan Das Devi and Suresh Soni
 ye teenon naam kaise sirf sangh parivaar ke bheetar hi lokapriy hai yaa phir sangh-bijepi ke rishton kii ankahi kahani ke bich hi siyaasi chaisar bichaate rahe hai, yah kisi se chupa nahin he
 The reason is that not only the Sangh but the saints also believe that if anyone is closest to their heart in the list of politicians, they are Modi
 yahi vajah he ki kisi dharm sansad main santon ne pehali baar kisi netaa kaa naam liya ki use pradhanmantri pad par bithaaya janaa chahie
 The saints never raised this voice about Vajpayee or Advani
 lekin iskaa doosraa pahalu yah he ki modi ke taur-tareekon se koi or nahin balki gujarat main viechpi hi pareshaan rahi, jise ab aane vaale vakt main mandir andolan kii aguai kerani pad sakati he
 So the first big question is whether Modi has left the passion of Hindutva or Ram temple and the path of development has started to create his new image, is it for the existing political power equation or is it for the first time that the Sangh Parivar is realizing that Hindutva To simply stop thinking of the temple means to close many other paths to reach power
 doosraa sawaal yaheen se shuru hota he ki hindutv ko aatank se jodakar jo paribhaasha sarkaar gadhia chaah rahi he, uskaa daag rajtilak ke rup main badal jaae, yah bijepi or sangh parivaar kii duusari ranneeti to nahin he
 Whether it was the meeting of the Central Guide Board of 340 delegates or the Dharma Sammelan of more than seven thousand saints, it raised the issue of Hindu terrorism in such a way that every saint and swayamsevak should feel that he is silent or standing in the future
 If he does not join the movement, the crisis will come to his own existence
 isiilie viechpi ram mandir andolan kii jo ruparekha bichaana chaah rahi he, use bijepi ne khuli sahmati di he
 And concrete initiatives are also being taken to make the movement a weapon to connect the vote bank politics
 yah apane aap main ek nayab rajnatik soch he ki viechpi kii aguai main deshbhar ke sant apane-apane kshetra main 18 se 30 baras tak ke yuvaaon ko ganga jal se yah pran karwaakar ram mandir banavaane ke andolan se jodenge ki 2014 ke chunaav main ve apana vot jarur daalen
 And their number will be 15 crores
 yah bahut hi asambhav-sa pran he lekin viechpi dharm sansad ke jariye jo baat kar rahi he, uske sanket saaf hai ki bijepi chaahakar bhi ram mandir mudde se nahin batch sakati or uske saath khadey sahyogi rajnatik dal chaahate hue bhi soft hindutv se apana pind nahin chhudaa sakate
 This difficulty will also be in front of Congress
 isliye silsilewar tareeke se agar ram mandir ko lekar khadey hone vaale andolan ke aks main vot back kii siyasat ko hi parakhen to 2009 main bijepi ko sirf saadhe aath karod se kuch zyada vot mili the
 While sitting in power, the Congress got eleven and a half million votes
 aise main agar dharm sansad ke aahvaan ke baad vaaki desh main bijepi kii shirkat ke bagaiyr bhi andolan shuru ho jaataa he to un karodon yuvaaon ke maanas ko samajhnaa hoga jinka janm ayodhya andolan ke vakt nahin hua tha
 In fact, not only BJP, but also the whole question before the entire Sangh Parivar, the biggest question is that not only in terms of vote bank but also to energize the movement, the generation that has only heard about the Ayodhya movement after its birth is
 or jo suna he, vah desh kii dharmanirpekshata main send lagaataa he
 In such a way, how will that young mind stand up with the same Singhal and Togadia who were chanting the same raga two and a half decades ago
 or isi ke aasare satta paane ke baavjood bijepi ne ram mandir ke mudde ko hi taak par dhar diya
 However, BJP President Rajnath Singh gave three facts clearly in the interview given to this reporter
 pehla jab tak bijepi ko apane boote bahumat nahin miltaa, tab tak vah ram mandir kaa nirmaan kaise kar sakati he
 Second, how can the BJP maintain its existence by forgetting the Ram temple
 or teesraa hindutv hi vah dhara he, jiske sahare vikaas kii baat ho sakati he
 That is, from the development of Modi to bringing the Ram temple of the Sangh Parivar under one umbrella, Rajnath is seeing his utility
 lekin yaheen se dilli or dharm sansad ke teen sawaal bhi nikalate hai
 The first vhp's problem is that it does not have the strength to relive the '90s
 doosraa, bijepi kaa antarvirodh ki vah apane boote satta main nahin aa sakati or sahyogiyon ke talmail ke saath maujuuda daur main unke paas congress kii arthniti kaa vikalp nahin he
 And the Ram temple, which the third Sangh Parivar chief, Bhagwat, considers to be his mission, is not possible until his own three dozen organizations and the BJP, together with the basic thinking of the RSS, always say Vatsale
 sangh kii taraf se to isaki shuruyaat bhagwat ne arase baad khud viechpi ke kumbh main lage shaamiyane main ja kar kii
 Visiting the VHP camp five hours before the commencement of the Dharma Sansad and Sant Mahasamlane on February 7 and putting his stamp on the Ram temple campaign, Bhagwat had already indicated that the VHP should take the lead in the future but It is also his first motive to unite the family on the issue
 iskaa asar yahi hua ki rajkot se aae mahamandaleshwar swami vaishnavadas hon yaa maharashtra se aae mahamandaleshwar swami bhagavanta nandagiri yaa badrinaath se aae swami vasudevanand saraswati—sabhi ne apane bhaashan main ek swar main hindutv ke aasare siyasat thaamne or paane kaa mantra bhi diya
 Three perceptions about Modi within the Sangh Parivar are clear
 gujarat main jo kaam somnath mandir ko lekar khamoshi se ek vakt sardaar patel ne kar diya
 No one has been able to do that work in Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh and in the current situation only Gujarati Modi can reach Ayodhya for the purpose of Sangh Parivar
 sangh parivaar modi ko congress ke us aarthik dhaanche main bhi send lagane main safal maanata he, jise manmohan singh ne khadaa kiya he
 And the third considers Modi successful in removing the air of the Congress's claim to connect the family with terror
 yani saamaajik taur par ram mandir-hindutv sangh parivaar ko jode or rajnatik taur par modi ke jariye bijepi ko ekajute kiya jaae
 The resonance of crores of people who reached the Sangam on the sidelines of the Parliament of Dharma also gave rise to some questions, which are not answered by the Sangh Parivar nor with the BJP
 na hi viechpi apane bhavishya ke andolan ke jariye inkaa jawaab de paaegi
 For example, every religion parliament since the first religion parliament held in Delhi in 1984 has been successful in the same religion parliament which is in a position to create or spoil the electoral equation by threatening the politics
 isliye ve
 P
 singh sarkaar ko chaar maheene kaa ultimatum dekar 1989 main car seva ko paravaan chadhaane vaale 2013 main post najar aa rahe hai
 And new generation of saints also have new questions
 unhen mandir se zyada hindutv kaa matlab shiksha-diksha se lekar ganga safai or samskruti ko sahejane main samaj aata he
 For example, the Rasiya Baba in the court of Mahakumbh, in which the Central Guiding Board stamped the Ram Temple, was the same Rasiya Baba in 1992 when he was only 27 years old
 or agar ve khud ko bataur car sevak 1992 main dekh rahe the to 2013 main unhen lagata he ki pehali jarurat to hindutv ke raste ko hi bachaana he
 They want to make the new generation ritual by opening schools so that at least the business in the name of Hindutva is not stopped
 rasiyaa baba akele nahin hai
 There are queues of hundreds among the saints who were car servants in 1992 and in 2013 they needed car servants for the construction of Ram temple
 cheharaa viechpi kaa bhi badla he
 In the '90s VHP considered strengthening the organization important
 2013 main sanghathan ke badale pad paane kii lalak nae viechpi kaaryaktaaon main badi he
 Along the same lines, more devotion among the millions of saints within the Mahakumbh was only to be immersed in Hindu culture by taking a dip in the filthy Ganges
 yani 12 kimi lambey or 6 kimi chaide mahakumbh ke bich sirf aadhe kimi se bhi kam raste main samoochee dharm sansad simati rahi or sant yah bhi tay nahin kar paae ki jis ganga ke aasare ve hindutv kii potli baandh kar ekajute hue, us ganga par bhi ek prastaav le aate ki yah nadi saaf ho or usamen pani to bache
 Perhaps that's why in the courtyard of Vaishnavadas Ji Maharaj of Gujarat (just in front of the meeting of the Parliament of Religions), 90-year-old Malti Devi, who came from Ahmedabad, said this much after Modi's name, "mahakumbh, there is no water in the Ganges
 modi honge to pani bhi aa jayega or ganga kaa rang bhi chokha ho jayega

 The South Western District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum found that this act of this big telecom company is very bad

 ’ The Bharatiya Janata Party churns on Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 7 june se goa main shuru ho rahi party kii baithak se pehle laalkrishna adwani or rajnath singh kii baithak hui
 According to sources, in this meeting Advani has agreed to make Modi the chairman of the Election Committee for the next general elections, but at the same time he has made a condition that along with promoting Modi, Gadkari will also be released later this year
 Command to be handed over for the upcoming assembly elections
 bataaya jaataa he ki gadakari ko ye prastaav manjuur nahin he
 In fact, there were reports on Tuesday that Advani wanted to lead the party's election campaign in 2014 to former president Nitin Gadkari
 is silsile main donon netaaon ke bich baithak bhi hui
 However, Gadkari turned down Advani's proposal
 vahiin, party main modi ke samarthak chaahate hai ki chunaav prachaar ke netritv ko lekar jald faisla hona chahie, kyonki samay se pehle loksabhaa chunaav ko nahin nakaara ja saktaa
 In such a situation, the party should not be left behind
 modi kheme ke logon kaa kahana he ki iskaa faisla jald ho taaki gujarat ke mukhyamantri ko chunavi ranneeti ke liye samay mili
 In view of the current developments, Advani's offer to Gadkari points to his growing distance from Modi

 By voting qualified candidates in the elections, the public can open a path of prosperity for themselves
 vaise is baar kahaan, kiskaa palada baari he, yah jaanane ke liye 'local factor' par gaur karnaa jaruri ho jaataa he
 Here is the 19th installment of 'bihar diary before election'
 
 
 saharsa jila mukhyalay se kuch hi dur aage he bangaanv or usase aage kosi kinare he mandan mishra-bharti kaa gaanv mahishi
 There is a legend that Shankaracharya had come from Mandan to debate in Mahishi and he had to lose once to Mandan's wife Bharti
 mithila or maithil brahmanon kaa gaurav sthal he mahishi or bangaam
 Mahishi would be one of the few villages in the country that produced IAS-IPS in bulk
 bangaanv main pravesh karte hi prasiddh sant lakshminath gosai kii kuti dikhti he or chamchamata hua mandir
 Retired elderly sitting in the temple courtyard
 pichley tees-chasil saal main mithila or uttar bihar ke gaanv jahaan ek taraf viraan ho gaye hai, bangaanv main chahal-pahal dikhti he
 People come to live in the village even after retiring from the job
 gaanv kya he, acha-khaasaa kasbaa he
 atms of private banks, many cyber cafes and paved streets
 bujurgon se baat hoti he, to hamaare darbhanga-madhubani se hone kii charchaa sunakar aahlaadit ho uthte hai
 The second bridge over Kosi between Baluha ghat-gandaul is ready
 ek bujurg kehete hai, ‘ab to shaadi-vivaah bhi hone laga he
 'the exact same thing was said by Phanparag Renu, the MLA son of Phaniswanath Renu,' Because of Kosi, my sister could not get married
 ’ sadiyon kii pyaas maano jinda ho uthi he or isamen andeh nahin ki iskaa shrey nitish sarkaar ko jaataa he
 That means feelgood is full
 gaanv main power sab-stesan hone se bijli kaaphi rahati he
 Our agenda is to see the Baluha Ghata bridge before dusk and then the star place in Mahishi and the house of litterateur Rajkamal Chaudhary
 baluaha ghaataa pul mahishi se 2-3 kilometre uttar hoga, haal hi main nitish kumaar ne uskaa udghaatan kiya he
 Signboards are shining from far away - Darbhanga 78 km, Muzaffarpur 140, Samastipur
 
 
 
 
 
 It is a wonderful sight, right after Pandit Nehru called the bridges and factories 'the shrines of modern India'
 jo kaam is jile main janame lalitnarayan mishra or jagannatha mishra nahin karvaa paae the, use nitish kumaar ne puraa kar diya
 There are thirteen bridges from Baluhaghat to Gandaul and just a few miles away via Kusheshwarsthan and embankment - Bhagwanpur
 gandaul main maano mela laga hua he- kamala par aakhri pul kaa kaam din-raat chal rahaa he
 There is a feeling of happiness on the face of the people and an unstated gratitude to the Nitish government
 mahishi do-do loksabhaa kshetra kaa milan sthal he
 Some villages in the block are in Khagaria, and some in Madhepura Lok Sabha
 ek sthaneey shikshak kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne to idhar kaaphi kaam kiya he, lekin madhepura seat par 'pappu' majboot padegaa
 The entire emphasis of the Brahmins seems to be towards the BJP and to the yadav-muslim Pappu Yadav
 atyant pichde kidar jaaenge? iskaa jawaab nahin he
 What will happen to Sharadji? Silence
 
 
 ugratara mandir ke praangan main oonche khambhe par bada-sa mast lite chamak rahaa he or panditji paan kaa peak phenkate hue kehete hai, ‘to yahi tay rahaa ki camel ko khilaanaa he
 See, Pappu is strong in Madhepura and his wife in Supaul
 ye to maan lijie ki supaul desh ke gine-chune kshetron main hoga, jahaan congress ko aas hogi!’puure mithila main teen prasiddh devi sthanon main mahishi kaa ugratara mandir anyatam he
 The other two are Uchaith in Madhubani and Sakhara in Nepal border
 kosi ke tamaam netaa matarani ke charnon main mattha techne aa rahe hai
 BJP candidate Vijay Kushwaha from Madhepura, who recently joined BJP from JDU, was also accompanied by his wife and former Industries Minister Renu Kushwaha of Nitish government
 renu abhi bhi takneekee taur par jediu kii vidhayak hai
 The newspaper people wanted to take the photo, then politely refused, 'I am doing the duty of an Indian woman
 plis photo mat lijie
 
 
 'the assembly constituency is also named after Mahishi village but for those delimiting that Mahishi is not the only village in the assembly! The Ugratara temple in Mahishi has a statue of Mahatma Buddha on top of the idol of the goddess
 shaayad buddha kii murti yah darshata he ki ek samay main mithila main bhi buddha dharm kaa khaasaa prabhaav ho gaya tha
 Also, there are many ancient idols, whose safety is believed by God
 nitish sarkaar ne itnaa kiya he ki pichley kuch saalon se ugratara mahotsav kaa aayojan ho rahaa he
 Due to the dense evening, we could not see Mandandih, for which local people are writing letters to the Archaeological Survey of India for extensive excavation
 hindi-matholi ke prasiddh sahityakar raajakmal choudhary kaa janm mahishi main hi hua tha
 Our taxi passes by their house and misses the 'fish died'
 ab ham supaul kii taraf bad rahe hai
 Parasrama, Karnapur
 
 
 ek-ek gaanvon kaa sinboard saamne aata he or daadi ke munh se suni kahaniyaan yaad aa jaati hai
 Saharsa became the 'second Muluk' for the darbhanga-madhubani people due to the lack of a bridge over Kosi! The road is good, but nowhere to eat a good hotel
 log kehete hai ki idhar sadak banavaane main bijli mantri bijendra yadav kaa bhi yogadan he
 By the way Kosi flood money has also been used
 supaul main ek chhokara fal bech rahaa he
 When i ask him who will vote, he says that who will be the strongest
 majboot kaa kya matlab he? majboot kaa matlab strang, fauladi netaa!meraa driver kahata he ki janata shaatir ho gai he, sidhaa jawaab nahin detii

 'kiski hawa he?'‘wo aayaa tha na sher
 
 
 In Purnia
 ’‘koun sher?''are vahiin, bharat maa kaa sher
 You know Babu, that day i sat on the TV at 11 o'clock, then got up at three o'clock
 'main poochta hum, ‘kya naam he aapkaa?’‘vicesar nishad
 i am a seafarer of caste
 purniya gulabbagh mandi ke paas mere bete kii shaadi hui he
 This time all the sailors will vote for Modi
 ’'kyon degaa?''desh ko ghotaalon se bachaana he
 'BJP has put Ayodhya foundation stone Kameshwar Chaupal in Supaul, the old Sanghi
 'lekin yahaan majboot koun he?'‘saraji, yahaan ranjita ranjan ko halkaa nahin maan sakate
 By the way, the fight is strong

 a few days ago, Tanushree Dutta took a dig at Ajay Devgan for working with Aloknath in the film De De Pyar De
 tanushri ke alaava kangana kii bahan rangoli ne bhi silecelewar twits main ajay devgan par dikhavi hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 Angered by this, Ajay Devgan has recently given an official statement
 unhone kaha he ki film kii shooting alokanath par aarope lagane se pehle hi puri ho chuki thi
 At that time, the situation was not in my control
 film 'de de pyaar de' main alokanath sang kaam karne ke sawaalon par aakhirkaar ajay ne apni chuppi todi
 He said that 'the film should have been released in October last year as its shooting was completed in September
 alokanath ke saath jo bhi seen shoot kiye gaye the unki shooting agast main puri ho chuki thi
 All these scenes were shot on different sets within 40 days which also had an outdoor location
 isamen 10 actors shaamil the
 Allegations surfaced after Aloknath completed shooting with him
 '(contd)
 
 
 
 and all those who are enjoying the sweetness of silence just because it is happening to somebody else’s daughter shall know the world is round and everything comes around 🙏 # Metoo— Rangoli Chandel (@rangoli_a)april 17, 2019un seens main alokanath ko hataakar sabhi actors se dobaaraa date or kambinaton lekar ri-shoot karnaa lagbhag naammumkin tha
 This would have caused a lot of money loss for the producers
 alokanath ko riples karne kaa faisla keval meraa nahin ho saktaa tha
 i had to go with the decision of the entire unit
 main mitu abhiyaan ko lekar behad samvedansheel hum
 But in such a situation when i do not control it, then i do not know why people are trying to tell me an insensitive and false person
 de de pyaar de film ke trailor laanch ke dauraan alokanath se jude kisi bhi sawaal kaa jawaab dene se ajay bachate rahe
 On these questions, Ajay said that the shooting of the film was completed even before Aloknath was accused
 gauratlab he ki pehle ajay devgan ne soshal media par mitu abhiyaan kaa saport kiya tha
 Ajay had said that he would not work with anyone who is accused of committing such wrongdoing
 It is because of these men our country is a black spot on world map as far as crimes against women are concerned,shame on you bollywood for mocking # metoohttps: / / t
 co / nsq6dua0we— Rangoli Chandel (@rangoli_a) April 17, 2019 He wrote via Twitter post last year that he is very upset with such incidents
 wo or unki company mahilaon ko izzat or suraksha dene main vishwaas rakhti he
 If anyone has done anything wrong with any woman, neither ADF nor they are with that accused
 haalanki baad main pitiai ke saath ek intervyuu ke dauraan ajay ne kaha ki bahut se aise naam hai jinka naam saamne aane par unhen jhatka laga he, magar main kisi ke saath tab tak jajmental nahin ho saktaa jab tak ki vah aarope siddh nahin ho jate
 These men are so intoxicated with power and money, they are teasing the movement by supporting fellow harassers and slyly mocking the victims, also shamelessly defending their actions with lame excuses
 
 
 (contd)— Rangoli Chandel (@rangoli_a)april 17, 2019haal hi main abhinetri tanushri datta ne mitu ke aropit alokanath sang kaam karne par ajay devgan or film ke nirmaataaon kii jamkar khinchaai kii thi
 He pointed to Ajay Devgan through the post, saying that the entire city is full of liars, pretenders and hypocrites
 bataa den ki alokanath par lekhika vinata nanda ne rape kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Tanushree said that once Aloknath's allegations were made public, all the scenes of Aloknath could be re-shot
 magar ek dushkarm aaropee ko film main rakhkar sirf vinata nanda hi nahin balki ham sabhi par unhone jeet hasil kii he
 Encounter Specialist Pradeep Sharma has been tightened in a fake encounter case
 esaiti ne guuruuvaar ko sharma ko giraftaar kar liya jise shuukravaar ko court main pesh kiya gaya
 In 2006, Ramnarayan Gupta was attacked by Pradeep Sharma's team outside nana-nani Park in Versova
 sharma ke mutabik ramnarayan ke taar chota rajan gang se jude hue the
 But Ramnarayan Gupta's brother Ramprasad approached the Bombay High Court in this case
 jiske baad court ne disipi em ke prasanna kii aguwai main ek special investigeshan team gathit kar use jaanch kaa jimmaa saunpa tha
 Earlier, Sharma was also suspended due to connivance with the underworld, but Sharma had moved the Maharashtra Admiration Tribunal against the decision and Sharma was reinstated following mat's order

 i wish there would have been an open discussion on the dress and cost of our leaders in public life on the pretext of suit
 tab aapako pradhanmantri ke suut ke bahaane pataa chal jaataa ki duusare netaaon ke suut or shawl kitne mahange hai
 Jawahar jacket of good fabric comes in eight-ten thousand, linen kurta also becomes so, but the suit length is three to five six lakhs
 shawl kii keemat bhi lakhon main ho sakati he
 Many mlas are seen wearing a suit of five to six lakhs
 jarur unki mehnat kii kamai itani hoti hogi
 The suit that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wore with President Obama in Delhi on 26 January has been put up for auction at the statue at the Science Center in Surat
 is suut ke alaava kapadon ke 237 item bhi nilaamee ke liye rakhe gaye, magar sabaki kismat is suut jaisi nahin he
 No one formally knows what the cost of this suit will be, but Rahul Gandhi said it was worth a million in his election rallies
 bijepi ke saansad siaar patil ne kaha ki surat ke log rahul gandhi se bhi zyada isaki keemat lagaayenge
 The suit that the Prime Minister got is priceless for us
 vaise rahul gandhi nilaamee main boli nahin laga rahe the, chunaav main aarope laga rahe the
 The bid for other items may be in a few thousands, but the auction of the suit started from lakhs and reached one crore twenty lakhs by the evening
 antim keemat tisare din hi pataa chalegi, jab nilaamee samaapt hogi
 The buyer is Modi's fans, who are describing their relationship with him as very old
 aapako bataa den ki narendra modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke taur par mili sabhi uphaaron kii nilaamee karte rahe hai or usase mili rakam sarkari yojanaon main dete rahe hai
 He at least tells how many gifts he got as Chief Minister and what he did
 baaki mukhyamantriyon kaa saarvajanik rup se pataa nahin chalata he
 But there is another twist in this story
 wo yah ki yah suut pradhanmantri ne khud nahin banwaaya tha, balki unke ek paariwarik mitra ne tohfe main diya tha
 Ramesh Virani, the company's director in the diamond business, came out through ANI news agency and told the whole story
 baaki sawaalon ke liye hamane bhi sampark karne kaa prayaas kiya magar naakaam rahe
 
 rameshkumar bhikabhai viraani ne yun bataaya ki unhone pradhanmantri ko apane bete kii shaadi main nimantrit karte vakt yah suut length tohfe main diya tha, kyonki unke pitaaji jab bhi narendra bhai se milte, ek dhoti zarur dete
 The idea of writing Modi's name on the suit was from my son, who wanted to give him a gift so that he would be shocked
 viraani sahab ne daam to nahin bataaya, lekin kaha ki jitna bataaya ja rahaa he, utana to nahin he or mere bete kii himmat nahin he ki wo itani badi rakam kharch kar de
 While answering, Virani Sahib encouraged Kautuhal that it would have cost so much to make such a suit from Britain
 ab aage kaa kissa yah he ki pradhanmantri ne usee din viraani ji ko kah diya tha ki ve ye suut nilaam kar denge or paise ko ganga safai abhiyaan main de denge
 Virani ji is passionate about the fact that the Prime Minister kept his family relationship and wore it on the day his son was married
 yani 26 janvari ko
 If this was the case then Virani ji could have stopped the controversies of the suit during the election itself
 par kya viraani ji kii safai se viraam lag gaya
 The day the news of the auction came to the media, the next day i
e
 on Wednesday, Virani ji appeared
 par congress is suut ko lekar kyon subah se aakraamak he
 During the Lok Sabha elections, every dress he wore as a prime ministerial candidate was flattering
 manmohan singh ke niraashaa bhare daur main janata ne in rangon ko unke netritv kaa hissaa maan sweekaar kar liya
 Many people also wrote a lot on their style statement, that is, how much they care about wearing and wearing clothes
 chunaav ke baad bhi unke rangeen kurte or jacket kai brands store ke liye nakal kaa zariyaa ban gaye
 But what did this suit do or what was so special about it that they had to face controversies about their dress
 naam kaa likhaa hona yaa iskaa daam
 Because the role of the media about the price is also raising questions about where this money came from
 ab batch gaya naam vaala masalaa
 Suits became an issue in Delhi elections
 antarrashtriya press main bhi isaki charchaa hui
 There is a kind of simplicity in the Prime Minister's designs on public forums since February 10
 agar ve is bare main koi sudhaar kar rahe hai, to kya unhen iskaa mauka nahin milanaa chahie
 Today, he wore a normal colored kurta and Sadri in Bangalore
 isse pehle srilanka ke raashtrapati ke saath bhi unke pahanaave main ek saadagi thi
 By the way, he has been wearing this type of kurta and jacket before
 mujhe hyderabad main roosi raashtrapati ke saath unka pahanavaa unke rangeen kurton se kahin zyada behtareen laga
 Sometimes, Prince also appeared in suit, but it seems that for the moment he has changed his attire
 bijepi is vivaad ko shuru se vyaktigat str or ochhi raajnneeti se jodakar dekhati rahi he
 a similar statement came from Finance Minister Arun Jaitley during the Delhi elections
 congress nilaamee kii khabar ko lekar kaaphi sakriy nazar aa rahi he
 The party says that the suit is being auctioned to prevent damage control
 itnaa hi nahin iske tahat niyamon ko bhi taak par rakhaa ja rahaa he
 It is expected that along with the Prime Minister's suit, the prices of the clothes of the other leaders will also become the subject of discussion

 It is understood that a provision has also been made in the Bill that whatever public reason will be given for the acquisition of land, it will not be changed after stating it
 vidheyak ko mantrimandal kii baithak main is bare main nirnay hone ke baad manjuuri di gai ki rajya apana khud kaa bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon banane ke liye mukt honge

 The Aam Aadmi Party started its campaign for the Lok Sabha elections from Haryana in a rally in Rohtak, where party convenor Arvind Kejriwal lashed out at everyone from Haryana Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda to Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi
 kejariwal ne modi par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki din bhar vah hawaii jahaaj or helicopter main ghoomte rahete hai, unki ek-ek raily main karodon kharch hote hai, ye paise kahaan se aa rahe hai
 
 
 400 crore rupees are being spent to increase Modi's name
 
 
 kejariwal ne rajya kii hooda sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki kisaanon se 22 lakh rupee acre jameen lekar reliance ko de di, jisane aage ek karod rupee lekar yahi jameen bech di
 Kejriwal said that Hooda has remained a property dealer, taking away the public's land and giving it to Reliance, Mukesh Ambani, Robert Vadra and DLF
 kejariwal ne kaha ki haryana main kisaanon ko fasal kii laagat se bhi kam keemat muhaiyaa karai ja rahi he, fasal barbaad ho jaae to muaavje ke rup main 10 se 20 rupee kaa check bhejte hai
 Kejriwal said that the government gives Rs 6 lakh crore as subsidy annually to big industrialists across the country, but gives a check of Rs 10 to farmers in the name of relief
 jis desh ke andar kisaan kii izzat nahin hoti, vah desh kabhi aage nahin bad saktaa

 On the issue of 20 AAP mlas, Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta said that the Hon'ble Court has given temporary relief to 20 mlas and directed the Election Commission to hear them again
 is tathy ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa ki nyaayalay ne 20 vidhayakon ko doshamukt nahin qaraar diya he
 He said that the Hon'ble Court has not raised any question on the matter of the post of profit of the original subject and on the recommendation of the President
 vijendra gupta ne kaha ki ham mananeey ucch nyaayalay ke nirnay kaa sammaan karte hai
 During the nearly two-and-a-half-year period of hearing in the Commission, the Election Commission gave opportunities for hearing more than 12 times, but these were deliberately ignored
 nyaayalay ne yah mana ki unhen sunwaayee kaa punah haq diya janaa chahie
 It has endorsed core subjects such as office of profit and recommendation of the President
 vijendra gupta ne aam aadmi party kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki party chunaav ayog jaisi sanvaidhanik sansthaaon par aarope laga rahi he
 It is unfortunate that this sensitive matter is being politicized
 'aap' kaa harsh main duubakar sanvaidhanik simaaen langhna shobhaa nahin detaa
 The decision of the High Court is a judicial process and we should all respect it warmly
 isko lekar raajnneeti karnaa nyyochit nahin he
 At the same time, on the Delhi High Court's decision in the case of 20 mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari said that the High Court's directive in the case of 20 mlas is a proof of Indian democracy and independence of the judiciary
 unhone kaha ki nyaayalay ne punah sunwaayee kaa nirdesh diya he
 The legislators were not exempt from the post of profit
 manoj tiwari ne kaha ki 20 vidhayakon par laabh ke pad ke maamle main aaj dilli ucch nayayalay dwaara chunaav ayog ko punah sunwaayee karne kaa nirdesh bhartiya loktantr evam nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa kaa ek anoothaa pramaan he
 Tiwari said that just as the BJP had welcomed the previous instructions of the Court and the Election Commission, similarly we respect today's instructions
 nishchit taur par chunaav ayog ko punah sunwaayee kerani chaiye
 At the same time, we should also note that the court has called for a re-hearing, but has not freed them from the blame of the post of profit
 is maamle main centre sarkaar ke vakil anil soni ne kaha ki philhal aaj ke aadesh main court ne mana he chunaav ayog main vidhayakon ko sunwaayee kaa puraa mauka nahin diya isliye maamle kii dobaaraa sunwaayee kii jaae
 However, the court has also said that a case of office of profit is made and the Election Commission was hearing it properly
 centre sarkaar ke vakil anil soni ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki aap ke vidhayakon ko court se mili raahat kahi bhi ye sabit nahin karti ki court ne unhen offis of profrit ke maamle main unhen bekasoor mana he
 In this case, the Election Commission now has two options, the first to notice all the 20 mlas again and hear them and the second challenge the today's order of the High Court in the Supreme Court
 abhi ke liye yah aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon ke liye raahat he kyonki aaj ke aadesh main court ne chunaav ayog kii raashtrapati ko bheji siforeeshon ko radd kar diya he
 But this is not the final decision, but in this case again, the Election Commission will hear in the case of Office of Profit and again it will be decided whether all these mlas are made the case of Office of Profit or not
 unhone kaha ki court ne apneadeshmen kaha he ki kyonki chunaav ayog ko dilli hoicourt ne is maamle kii dobaaraa sunwaayee karne ke aadesh die hai
 Therefore, the previous recommendations of the Election Commission will be considered canceled and the President's notification will also be considered canceled

 Verma emphasized the inclusion of those who are disconnected from political processes and said that better economic administration, simple and transparent trade and economic policy are necessary to increase trade in the region
 unhone kaha ki yah bhi ek baat he, jiske kaaran america ne vishwa vyapaar sanghathan main vyapaar suvidha samjhauta (tiefee) main sahaayta kii thi

 After breaking a 15-year-old alliance between the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, the Samajwadi Party was quickly made an ally, but broke away from it within 24 hours
 shanivaar ko congress ne apane tisare or aakhri suchi main 26 siton par ummidavaaron ke naam kaa elaan kar saaf kar diya ki wo rajya kii sabhi siton par chunaav ladegi
 On this stance of the Congress, Maharashtra SP chief Abu Asim Azmi accused the Congress of cheating and said, "we were talked to the Congress for 8 seats, while the matter was stuck in 3 seats
" mujhe shuukravaar raat 12 baje mukhyamantriji kaa phone aayaa unhone bataaya gaya ki dilli main alaakaman ne abhi tak seat bantwaaraa kaa faisla sweekaar nahin kiya he, maine iske baad poocha to kya karnaa he 
 
 
 Should i understand that the coalition is not happening, then the State President took the phone and said, "yes, we can understand something like this"
 ' Abu Asim Azmi accused the Congress of throwing daggers in the back and said that '77 people had demanded tickets from us
 agar congress ne apana faisla pehle suna diya hota to ham tikat baant chuke hote
 Abu Azmi also said, 'I never supported the policies of the Congress
 hamaari praathamikta bhaajapa-shivasena ko rokane kii thi

 His father was forced to change his political complexion
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle nitish kumaar rajya kaa daura kar rahe the to ye pita-putree unase mili
 This is not the only example of changing voters in Bihar
 aashcharya nahin ki 2010 vidhansabha chunaav bihar kaa anoothaa chunaav tha
 It was already guessed - from election watchers to voters - that Nitish Kumar is coming back to power
 lekin iske baavjood yah janadesh anoothaa he kyonki isamen rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) ko apratyaashit or jabardast kamyaabi mili
 Earlier this state was considered a place of scattered and formed politics, but today the NDA is the only NDA here
 nitish kumaar ke netritv vaale rajg ne bihar vidhansabha kii 243 siton main se 206 par kabja jamaa liya
 That is, he managed to win 85 percent of the seats
 nitish ne khud apane boote 115 siton par kabja kiya, jo bahumat se maatr saat siten kam he
 This is the biggest electoral victory in Bihar politics so far
 jaahir he, is shandaar jeet se har koi chakit he
 Nitish Kumar got the mandate in 2005 largely due to anti-lalu sentiment but the reasons for the 2010 success are completely different
 ab matadaata kaam dekhakar unka samarthan kar rahe hai, ve unke liye iklaute sandarbh ban gaye hai
 Nitish Kumar's victory in Bihar has become the first example of how development and good governance can dominate caste politics
 rajnatik str par nitish kumaar ke up-rashtrawaad ke vichaar ne lalu prasad yadav or ramvilas paswan jaise pahchaan kii raajnneeti ke saudagaron ko karaari chot pahunchaai
 This undermined the plans for a strong revival of the Congress
 lekin nitish kumaar kii jeet kaa sarokaar unki shakhsiyat se he
 If you visit Bihar - villages, towns or districts, which are in order from bottom to top in terms of infrastructure - every person you meet will tell you that Nitish is a good man
 un par bharosa karne waalon ne unhen vot dene kii sari vajahon ko darkinar kar diya
 And even those who liked Nitish's opponents did not completely dislike him
 unhone bhale hi nitish ke kattar pratidwandvi ko vot diya par unhone satta virdohi lahar nahin khadi kii
 These are not the only things in favor of Nitish
 aam aadmi kaa akalan ''kuch kiya he'' mukhyamantri ke paksh main dhire-dhire vyapak samarthan main badal gaya
 Many people understood this, but they could not guess it before the results came
 dekha jaae to nitish jis sushasan ke bare main praayah baat karte hai, use puri tarah nahin de paae
 Statistics show that Bihar is far from being a truly developed state
 rajya main prati vyakti aay ab bhi sabase kam he, mahaj 10 fisadi gharon main bijli he, 55 fisadi se zyada aabaadi garibi rekha ke neeche jivan yaapan kar rahi he, har saal hajaaron log rojgaar kii talash main rajya se baahar jate hai, sarkaar baadh se thik se nahin nibat saki or maovadi bada khatra ban gaye hai
 But voters clearly rejected all the shortcomings
 november 2005 main bihar kaa mukhyamantri banane ke baad se nitish kumaar bhi apni soshal ejineering se apane prati logon kii sadashyata juta rahe the
 Through special welfare schemes, he extended his hand to the backward, Dalit among the Dalits as well as Muslims and women
 iske alaava ve apni vyaavhaarik raajnneeti ko apni dharmanirpeksh pahchaan ke saath milaane main kaamyaab rahe
 In addition, he achieved incurable electoral results through development and social justice
 aashcharya nahin ki nitish kumaar ne shandaar jeet ke baad pehle samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ''matadaataaon ne puraani raajnneeti ke saath peeche jane kii bajaae pragati kii raah par aage badhane kaa faisla kiya
 "he made it clear that hope has won over fear
" rajg kii is shandaar jeet se deshbhar main vyapak asar ho saktaa he
 Although the Bihar Chief Minister considers himself "unwilling and not worthy" of the Prime Ministerial candidacy in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 59-year-old Nitish Kumar of Pisces has definitely come under the category of people deserving the country's premier post
 nitish kaa kahana he ki ve bihar main jame rahanaa chaahate hai lekin agar ve uttar pradesh jaise padosi rajyon kii raajnneeti main dilchaspee lene lagen to kisi ko aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 The message of his victory is also clear to the Manmohan Singh government - it is an era of game-changing chief ministers and the Congress must be fully prepared to meet the electoral challenge
 narendra modi, naveen patnayak or nitish kumaar jaise mukhyamantri apane karishme or vishwasaneeyata ke dam par apane rajyon gujarat, orissa or bihar main 87 loksabhaa siton par congress ko dhul chataa sakate hai
 As Arun Jaitley said in Patna, the Bihar NDA has strengthened the idea of NDA
 vastav main kargar rajnatik vikalp ke rup main uske punarutthan kii sambhaavna bad gai he
 Nitish Kumar maintained his secular identity while staying with the BJP
 ve rajg kii ore nae virgon ko aakarshith kar sakate hai yaa gathbandhan kaa samarthan chhod chuke virgon ko punah rijhaa sakate hai
 The NDA got such a large number of votes because of Lalu's vote bank
 lekin parinaamon se yah bhi spasht he ki gathbandhan ne matadaataaon ke nae varg ko bhi aakarshith kiya he-yah matadaataaon kii sankhya main vruddhi se jaahir he
 The turnout was 7 percent higher than last year's Lok Sabha elections
 iske alaava, mahilaon ne nitish ke paksh main bade paimaane par vot diya
 Their voting percentage reached around 55 percent
 2005 main 45 fisadi se bhi kam mahilaon ne matdaan kiya tha
 Apparently 10 percent higher turnout further affected the election results
 visheshkar isliye ki is baar keval 50
 Only 7 percent of the men voted
 in chunaav parinaamon se nitish kaa daaman bhar gaya he
 The level of performance and expectations has increased due to unexpected support
 nitish jeetne ke baad bhi pehle jitna hi vinamr bane hue hai
 Today, in the era of market economy, this socialist, who was cast in the framework of Ram Manohar Lohia, needs to look beyond socialism to take Bihar to the next level of development
 nitish kumaar-jinhone kargar vichaaron ko amal main laane ke liye paraspar virdohi vichaardhaaraon ko milaane main maharath hasil kar lee he-is kaam ko anjaam dene ke liye makul vyakti hai

 lagaataar barish ke chalate bangladesh or dakshin africa ke bich duusare or aakhri cricket test ke chauthe din kaa khel bhi ek bhi gend phenke bina radd ghoshit kar diya gaya
 This is the third consecutive day in this Test when not a single ball was bowled in the match due to rain
 barish ne lagaataar daalaa khalalaisse pehle baari barish ke kaaran duusare or tisare din ke khel ko bhi ek bhi gend phenke bina radd karnaa padaa tha
 Earlier, Bangladesh won the toss on the first day and scored 246 runs for eight wickets

 notebandi ko lagu hue puure 50 din ho gaye
 In such a situation, Aaj Tak's team reached Kair village, situated near the delhi-haryana border, where after the demonetisation, there is a lot of trouble in front of the countryside and farmers
 kair gaanv main pradhan ke ghar subah-subah rojaanaa lagbhag ek hi mudde par baat ho rahi he notebandi
 Mahendra Singh Dahiya, a resident of the village, has broken the back of farmers
 tamaato kii fasal bone ke baad notebandi lagu hui jiske baad tamaato kii fasal ke daam nahin mili
 In bulk, the tomato of the farmers sold one or one and a half rupees, which caused a lot of loss
 gaanv ke hi rahane vaale maangeram kaa kahana he ki 80 saalon main pehali baar unhone dekha ki fasal kii bowni ke vakt kisaan paise ke liye taras rahaa he
 Humans and animals of the village are also troubled by demonetisation
 ye ham nahin balki gaanv palam 360 ke pradhan ram karan singh kah rahe hai
 According to Ramkaran Singh, when you have to eat your own food, then how to arrange for the food of the animals
 haalanki jo chaara pehle se hi jamaa he usee se pashuon ko khaanaa khilaayaa ja rahaa he
 There is also a land in Kair village which has been separated from the farmer for the next 6 months since demonetisation

 ham naukari series ke 23wein ank par aa gaye hai
 The journey will continue
 agar saare rajyon se data mangaayen to pataa chalegaa ki lakh se zyaada naukariyaan court cese main fansi hai
 It is not necessary that due to the court, pending, many times these jobs are stuck due to non-completion of investigation
 dallali, dhaandhlee, paper li, galat sawaal jaise aaropon ke bagair shaayad hi koi pariksha puri hoti he
 Even if this is not the case, many exams do not take place after filling the form
 kai maamalon main ek pariksha ko sampann hone main ek saal se lekar 4 saal tak lag jate hai
 If you add the data of the examinations of these selection commissions, then you will find that together they have ruined the future of crores of students
 hamane naukari series main kai rajyon ke chayan aayogon kii parikshaon ke haal bataae, kisi ne jawaab nahin diya
 The Staff Selection Commission under the Central Government also did not respond but when the students reached there and started staging, the chairman said that NDTV is provoking
 jabaki ye chaatr pehali baar esayssi ke baahar nahin jamaa hue the
 It has been accumulated many times before
 tab chairman khurana ne nahin kaha ki enditivi bhadkaa rahaa he
 While earlier said that the coaching students are provoking them
 ummid he khurana sahab kahin yah na kah den ki raveesh kumaar ne desh ke grahamantri rajnath singh ko hi bhadkaa diya he jinhone kaha he ki sibiai se jaanch karai jaaegi
 Even then it will still work but Khurana saheb do not say that the coaching mafia has provoked the Home Minister
 sibiai jaanch hi kaaphi nahin he, esayssi kii pariksha karaane, riselt nikaalane or jwining letters dene kii kshamta kaa hi sarkaar adhyayan kara le to use pataa chal jayega ki vahaan kya ho rahaa he
 If the investigation is not completed within the time, then this investigation also does not make sense
 agar jaanch ke sahare pariksha latak gai to iskaa bhi koi laabh nahin
 Whether the allegations of the students are true or not is now being proved by investigation
 sarkaar ne unki baat maan lee he
 We kept their demand but did not go into the details of the allegations as it was beyond our understanding and capacity
 asheem khurana ko yah kehane se bachanaa chahie tha ki chaatro ko enditivi bhadkaa rahaa he
 The way to troll is outdated and i don't mind
 hamane naukari series ke dauraan karmchaaree chayan ayog ke alaava tamaam tarah ke chayan aayogon kii dhaandhlee kii kahani bataai he
 Stated for 23 episodes
 noujvaan to usase pehle se hi desh ke alag alag hisson main pradarshan kar rahe hai, akhbaar or tivi inhen cover nahin karata tha
 Used to do newspapers but used to put news in the inner pages
 jabaki noujvaan bhi akhbaar kareed kar padhate hai
 i certainly wondered where the courage to play in the lives of youth in these selection commissions comes from
 chaar-chaar saal se parikshaayen ataki hai, pariksha ho gai he magar riselt nahin aa rahaa he, rigelt aa gaya he magar jwining nahin hui he
 i definitely said that if the political consciousness of the youth of India does not deteriorate, no commission would have dared to ruin their lives
 maine zarur kaha tha ki tivi par chalane vaala hindu muslim topic naujavaanon ko kachare ke dher main badal rahaa he
 i had definitely said that the youth of India have gone through so much that they should be put on one dishonest examination system
 kya bharat kii maanon ne tay kar liya ki tivi par hindu muslim topic dikhaakar apane laadalon ko dangai bananaa he
 Have the youth decided that they will study in a poor college because they are going to become rioters later
 maine yah baat bhadakaane ke liye nahin, lakhon yuvaaon ko dangai hone se bachaane ke liye kahi he
 The Prime Minister has also said that communalism has to end by 2022
 aap noujvaan hi bataa den, duniya ke kis desh ke news channel ke prime time main aapane uniwarsity kii badahaal haalat par 27 episod dekhe hai, kis desh ke channel par 23 episod naukariyon kii haalat par dekhi he
 i did this work not to provoke the youth, but to tell that you have been ruined forever
 is barbaadi se nikalne ke saare raste hameshaa ke liye band ho chuke hai
 On 8 January and 17 January, we wrote letters to the Chairman of SSC
 unke pie kaa mail bhi aayaa ki number dijie
 It was said that when it is time, we will interview
 asheem khurana ko bhi phone kiya gaya tha
 But they could not muster the courage to give interviews
 godi media bulaakar kah dena ki enditivi bhadkaa rahaa he or yah samajhnaa ki tir maar liye hai, yah unki soch ho sakati he
 We have also praised Khurana Sahab several times during our series that he is giving a joining letter to more than 11,000 young people under the pressure of our series
 wo chaahate to badale main meri bhi tarif kar sakate the par koi baat nahin
 Thanks to Khurana ji for this
 jab tak ye chaatr esayssi ke baahar jamaa nahin hue tab tak unke liye koi netaa bhi nahin bolaa
 When he got on his stubbornness, he started speaking slowly
 shashi tharur ne twit kiya, jitendra singh se mulaakaat kii, arvind kejariwal ne twit kiya, randeep surajevaala ne press conference kii, yogendra yadav to kai baar gaye, bijepi saansad manoj tiwari or minakshi lekhi bhi gaye, kya in donon ko bhi enditivi ne bhadakaayaa tha, khurana sahab raajnneeti kar rahe the, ve pradarshan karne vaale chaatro se nahin mil rahe the, akhil bharti vidhyaarthee parishad ke netaaon se mil rahe the
 Well, we had to meet the order of CBI investigation
 duusare zilon main bhi in chaatro ke samarthan main pradarshan hone lage
 You must have seen in the prime time job series what was the condition before it started
 esayssi kii 2015 or 15 kii parikshaon kaa merit list agast 2017 main aa gaya lekin hamaari series ke shuru hone tak kareeb 15000 naujavaanon main se kisi ko jwining letters nahin mila
 No one was even answering these youngsters whether joining or not
 hamaari series ke dauraan inhen jwining letters milanaa shuru hua
 Haven't found everyone yet
 kai pariksha ke log phone kar rahe hai ki hamaara letters kab aayega
 Ideally, Khurana should call and tell him that your letter will come on this date
 aap un gharon main jaakar puuchhie ki main galat hum yaa esayssi galat he
 In 2016, the dopt Department of the Central Government issued an order that all recruitment procedures should be completed within 6 months
 esayssi isi kii report public ko de de
 The merit list came out in August 2017, as of March 2018, thousands of students still have not received the joining letter
 3000 se adhik noujvaan merit list main aane ke baad saat maheene se jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 During our series, 11000 such troubled students either received appointment letter, the process of meeting started or the cadre was allotted
 sieji vibhaag main data entry oparator ke liye kareeb 1000 naujavaanon ko provisional apointment letters mila he
 Some people have also joined it
 aap desh ke karodon chaatro kii maansik pidaa kaa andaaza kiijie
 Dena Bank invited forms in April 2017 for 300 PO
 farm kii fees 400 rupee thi
 The examination was to be held on 11 June 2017 but was canceled a few days before that
 farvari 2018 biit gaya, farm bharne vaale puch rahe hai ki wo imtahaan kab hoga
 Similarly, more than 700 successful candidates of the Central Bank of India are continuously writing that if they are not reinstated by 31 March, their result will be declared as zero
 abhi tak bank unhen jwainig letters nahin de rahaa he
 The month of March has arrived
 in 700 safal ummidavaaron kii maansik pidaa samajhie
 SSC released advertisement on 16 June 2017 for 354 posts of Stenographer Grade c and Grade
 pehali taarikh nikali 4 se 7 sitambar 2017 kii, badha kar 11 se 14 sitambar 2017 kar di gai
 The result of the written examination came on 21 November 2017
 uske baad inkaa skill test hona he jiske liye taarikh tay hui 4 janvari 2018
 After that comes the information that the exam is postponed
 abhi tak sthagit hi he
 The students are unable to know when the next exam will be held, why it is still stuck
 tippaniyan The result came on November 21, February 2018 passed
 teen maheene main skill test kii pariksha kaa pataa nahin he
 You must be thinking that this is the condition of SSC
 didie ne junior ejeeniyar ke pad ke liye march 2016 main vekency nikaali
 Forms were filled in May 2016
 isaki fees thi 558 rupee
 May 2016 to March 2018
 is pariksha kaa kuch ata pataa nahin he
 We found out that his PRO Mahinder Pal Singh told that ed
cil agency is a government organization, he conducts the examination
 vahi pariksha kara kar apoint karti he
 are doing
 assitant acount afasar, section afasar categiri ke hisaab se kar rahe hai
 Have done enough ab sirf 2-3 categiri baaki he
 After that Junior Engineer will do
 isaki soochna akhbaar main nikaalenge
 There is no date fix yet
 hamane ek agency he aid cell use de rakhaa he, vahi log karaayenge
 Examination will be done in 2018
 nai nai agenciyaan pariksha kara rahi hai, ham unke bare main jaanate tak nahin magar chaatro ko sab pataa he
 Now you have seen how one can wait till 2018 by filling the form in May 2016
 jab didie ke saath aisa he to baaki kaa kya hole hoga
 CBI investigation is not enough, if the government studies the ability to conduct SSC exam, get the results and give the joining letter, then it will know what is happening there
 tay samay main jaanch puri nahin hui to is jaanch kaa bhi matlab nahin
 If the examination hangs with the help of investigation then it is also no use
 chaatro ke aarope sahi hai yaa nahin, ab jaanch se hi sabit hone vaala he
 The government has agreed to them
 hamane unki maang ko zarur rakhaa magar aaropon ke detail main nahin gaye kyonki yah hamaari samaj or kshamta se baahar tha
 Ashim Khurana should have avoided saying that NDTV is provoking students
 trol karne kaa tarika purana ho chukaa he or mujhe koi fark nahin padataa
 During the job series, we have told the story of rigging of various types of selection commissions in addition to the Staff Selection Commission
 23 episod tak bataate rahe
 The youngsters are already performing in different parts of the country, newspapers and TV did not cover them
 akhbaar karte the magar bheetar ke panne main kone main khabar laga dete the
 While youngsters also buy and study newspapers
 maine zarur hairaani jataai ki in chayan aayogon main naujavaanon kii zindagi se khilne kii himmat kahaan se aati he
 Exams have been stuck for four years, the exam has been held but the result is not coming, the result has come but the joining has not been done
 maine zarur kaha tha ki bharat ke yuvaaon kii raajnneetik chetana karaab nahin hoti to kisi ayog ko himmat nahin hoti ki unki zindagi ko barbaad kar da
 i definitely said that the Hindu Muslim Topic running on TV is turning the youth into garbage heaps
 maine zarur kaha tha ki kya bharat ke yuva itane gaye guzare hai ki un par ek se ek beyimaan pariksha vyavastha lad di jaae
 Did the mothers of India decide that to riot their boys by showing Hindu Muslim topics on TV
 kya yuvaaon ne tay kar liya he ki ve ghatiya college main padhenge kyonki aage chal kar dangai bananaa he
 i have said this not to provoke, but to save lakhs of youth from rioting
 pradhanmantri ne bhi kaha he ki 2022 tak sampradayikta khatm kerani he
 You tell the youth, in which prime time news channel of the country, you have seen 27 episodes on the poor condition of the university, 23 episodes on which country's channel on the condition of jobs
 yah kaam maine naujavaanon ko bhadakaane ke liye nahin, balki bataane ke liye kiya ki tum hameshaa hameshaa ke liye barbaad kiye ja chuke ho
 All the ways of getting out of this waste have been closed forever
 8 janvari or 17 janvari ko hamane esayssi ke chairman ko patr likhaa
 His pa's mail also came that give the number
 kaha gaya ki jab samay hoga to intervyuu karenge
 Aashim Khurana was also called
 magar ve intervyuu dene kaa saahas nahin juta sake
 Calling the dock media and saying that NDTV is provoking and understanding that the arrows have hit, it may be their thinking
 hamane apni siries ke dauraan kai baar khurana sahab kii tarif bhi ki ve hamaari series ke dabaav main 11,000 se adhik naujavaanon ko jwining letters de rahe hai
 If he wanted, he could also praise me in return, but no problem
 iske liye khurana ji kaa shukriya
 Until these students gathered outside the SSC, no leader spoke for them
 jab ye apni zid par aa gaye tab dhire-dhire bolne lage
 Shashi Tharoor tweeted, met Jitendra Singh, Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, Randeep Surjewala held a press conference, Yogendra Yadav has visited many times, BJP mps Manoj Tiwari and Meenakshi Lekhi also visited, were they even provoked by NDTV Tha, Khurana Saheb was doing politics, he was not meeting the protesting students, meeting the leaders of Akhil Bharti Vidyarthi Parishad
 khayr milanaa padaa na, sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh to dena hi padaa
 Demonstrations were started in other districts to support these students
 aapane prime time kii naukari series main dekha hoga ki iske shuru hone se pehle kya haalat thi
 The merit list for SSC 2015 and 15 examinations came in August 2017 but none of the 15000 youngsters got a joining letter till the start of our series
 koi in naujavaanon ko jawaab tak nahin de rahaa tha ki jwining hogi yaa nahin
 During our series, they started receiving joining letters
 abhi tak sabhi ko nahin mila he
 Many examination people are calling when our letter will arrive
 kaayade se khurana ko phone kar unhen bataanaa chahie ki aapkaa letters is taarikh ko aayega
 You go to those houses and ask if i am wrong or SSC is wrong
 2016 main centre sarkaar ke diopiti vibhaag ne aadesh jari kiya tha ki bhartee kii sari prakriyaayein 6 maheene ke bheetar puri kar lee jaaen
 SSC should give the same report to the public
 agast 2017 main merit list aa gai, march 2018 tak abhi bhi hazaron chaatro ko jwining letters nahin mila he
 More than 3000 youth have been waiting for joining for seven months after appearing in the merit list
 hamaari series ke dauraan 11000 aise pareshaan chaatro ko yaa to apointement letters mila, milane kii prakriya shuru hui yaa kader alot hua
 About 1000 youngsters have received provisional appointment letters for data entry operator in CAG department
 kuch log isamen se jwining bhi kar chuke hai
 Estimate the mental anguish of crores of students of the country

 February 2018 has passed, form-fillers are asking when will that examination take place
 usee tarah central bank of india ke 700 se adhik safal ummidavaar lagaataar likh rahe hai ki agar 31 march tak unki bahaali nahin hui to unka riselt shunya ghoshit ho jayega
 As of now, the bank is not giving them the joining letter

 After that they have to have a skill test for which the date has been fixed 4 January 2018
 uske baad soochna aati he ki pariksha sthagit kii jaati he
 It is still postponed
 chaatro ko pataa nahin chal paa rahaa he ki agali pariksha kab hogi, kyon abhi tak ataki he
 The comments 21 november ko rigelt aayaa, farvari 2018 biit gaya
 Skill test examination is not known in three months
 aap sochate honge ki esayssi kaa hi ye haal he
 DDA took out vacancy in March 2016 for the post of Junior Engineer

 We have an agency, Ad Cell has given it to them, the same people will do it
 2018 main pariksha ho jaaegi
 New new agencies are conducting exams, we do not even know about them, but students know everything
 ab aapane dekha ki may 2016 main farm bhar kar koi 2018 tak kaise intazaar kar saktaa he
 When this is the case with DDA, what will be the rest of the hole? hamane naukari series ke dauraan karmchaaree chayan ayog ke alaava tamaam tarah ke chayan aayogon kii dhaandhlee kii kahani bataai he
