 a post shared by Bobby Deol (@iambobbydeol) on Apr 8, 2018 at 4:12 am PDT euro encap (euro NCAP) kaa matlab he - european new car assesament program (european New Car Assessment Programme), jisaki shuruyaat varsh 1997 main hui thi or ab lagbhag puure europe main iske nateezon ko mana jaataa he
 In fact, in 1996, the Swedish National Road Administration (SNRA), the International Automobil Federation (FIA) and the International Testing Association started the program for the first time, which led to Euro Encap
 varsh 1997 main iskaa pehla nateeja nikaala gaya tha, jiske baad car companiyon ne is test ke kade maapdandon kii kaaphi aalochana kii, lekin aaj yah sthiti he ki duniyabar main is reating ko aadhikarik mana jaataa he
 Actually, the task of Euro Encap is to break new cars
 ji haa, kaaron kii majbooti unhen todakar hi to janchi ja sakati he, to is test ke tahat nai kaaron ko krash-test kiya jaataa he, yah jaanane ke liye ki ve kitni sef hai - driver, paisanger or yahaan tak ki paidal yatriyon ke liye bhi
 These are usually the crash tests of passenger cars and suvs, under which cars crash with different angles
 sabhi test krash lab main kiye jate hai, taaki takkar se jude sabhi aankade record kiye ja saken
 Tests to be performed include frontal impact, ie a direct collision, in which the car travels at a speed of 64 kmph and collides with a structure of equal weight
 iske alaava kiye jate hai - said impact (yani said kii takkar kaa test), or pole impact (yani khambhe yaa ped se takkar) test
 In addition to all these, there is also a Pedestrian Protection Test, which tests how much damage a car can cause if it hits a pedestrian
 in krash teston ke baad kaaron ko milte hai star, yani sitare
 Euro Encap releases a report on every new car, which shows how safe the car is
 jinamein vayask yatriyon (edlt), bacchon, tathaa paidal yatriyon kii category shaamil hai
 Every car gets a star according to its safety
 sabase sef, yani surakshit car ko milte hai paanch sitare
 European customers can also find out which car is safe
 unhen janaa hoga euroncap
 com, where they have to click on their car
 lekin afsos he ki is list main europe kii kaaren hi rahi hai, or hindustani kaaron kii to abhi entry hi hui he

 14 or 15 agast ko is baar bharat-paak seemaa par biguef or paak rangers ke bich mithaiyon or uphaaron kaa aadan-pradaan nahin hoga
 Angered by the firing of Pakistani Rangers, BSF has decided in this regard
 biguef mukhyalay ne is faisle ke bare main desh ke pashchimi sector main apane suraksha balon ko suchit kar diya he

 a BSF official said, "the exchange of sweets and gifts will not happen this time on August 14, the Independence Day of Pakistan and on August 15, the day of India's independence
 faisle se apni ikaayiyon ko avgat kara diya gaya he
 The gift was rejected on the occasion of Eid, in the last few months, relations between the two countries have deteriorated
 pichley maheene id ke maukey par bharat kii ore se is tarah ke sadbhaav ko pakistan ne thukraa diya tha
 Security forces deployed along the borders of the two countries have been exchanging sweets on the international border in Jammu and the attari-bagha border in Amritsar in Punjab and in some places in Rajasthan and Gujarat on national festivals or other occasions

 is formule ko desh ke sabhi rajyon main lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He said that Assam needs Assam model, not Gujarat model

 rahul ne kaha ki rajya 1950 ke dashak se deyari ke kshetra main acha pradarshan kar rahaa he or vah iskaa shrey lene ke hakdaar nahin hai
 He said that BJP believes that Gujarat model can be replicated all over the country but it cannot

 BJP has even said that if Rahul is not fit for the post of PM at the age of 42 then how will he be at the age of 52
 ab ghamaasan chhid gaya he
 Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi may be seen as the next prime ministerial candidate, but his silence on important issues and attempts to steer away from responsibilities have emerged as flaws
 unki inhen tathakthith kamajoriyon ko mudda banaakar ek videshi patrika ne unki netritv kshamta par sawaal uthaa die
 Now Samajwadi Party (SP) is also beginning to doubt Rahul's ability
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) to maano iske intjaar main hi baithi thi
 The British magazine 'the Economist' published a comment on Wednesday, stating that Rahul shuns responsibility because he lacks the appetite to carry out such responsibilities
 tippanee main yah bhi kaha gaya he rahul ne ek netaa ke taur par ab tak na to koi yogyata dikhaai he or na hi badi jimmedaari ke liye unamem tatparta dikhti he
 Among the political parties, the first reaction came from the SP, which was not as expected
 centre main congress sarkaar ko samarthan de rahi sapa ne rahul kii netritv kshamta par andeh vyakt karte hue kaha ki vah gat do varsho tak loksabhaa main chuppi saadhe rahe jab desh kai ahm muddon par charchaa kar rahaa tha
 SP General Secretary Mohan Singh told reporters in Kolkata, "anyone who understands Indian politics will say that Rahul Gandhi does not have the capacity to lead the country in view of the challenges that the country is facing
" ' singh ne kaha ki pichley do varshon main rahul gandhi loksabhaa main chuppi saadhe baithe rahe jabaki kai samvedansheel muddon par charchaa hui
 He said, 'in the last two years we did not get a single chance when we could hear that Rahul has put his analysis in Parliament on the sensitive issue related to the country facing many problems
 jab kisi ne unhen bolte hue nahin suna he, kaise koi kah saktaa he ki uske haathon main desh surakshit he
 'BJP was waiting for a chance
 usne to yah tak kah diya ki brands rahul to najar hi nahin aata he
 BJP spokesperson Rajeev Pratap Rudy said that we could not hear Rahul speaking on inflation or the issue of corruption or the controversy over allocation of coal blocks
 yahaan tak ki unhone 2ji spectrum ghotaale par kuch bhi nahin kaha jisamen purv doorsanchaar mantri e
 The king had to go to jail
 unhone kaha ki koyala block aavanton kaa mudda lagbhag ek maheene se chal rahaa he lekin rahul ne chup rahanaa hi munasib samajha
 Rudy said, “the issue of coal block allocation has been making headlines since a month
 kabhi unhen is kol get ke bare main bolte nahin suna
 Therefore, the brand Rahul does not appear
 'congress main rahul ke badi bhoomika main aane ke sambandh main puche gaye ek sawaal par rudi ne kaha, 'jab 42 saal main koi feet nahin baith rahaa he to kaise kaha jaae ki 52 saal main vah feet baithegaa
 How could anyone say that
 
 The Congress has to decide

 Perhaps this is why Lalu, who arrived at the rjd's black day in Subhai of Hajipur, was seen sleeping continuously during the assembly against demonetisation

 manch par netaaon kaa bhaashan chalata rahaa, taalia bajati raheen, lalu yadav zindaabad ke naare bhi lagate rahe lekin lalu lagaataar manch par sote rahe
 Although Lalu Prasad Yadav himself, along with the RJD workers, tied a black band in his hands and protested against the ban on demonetisation, but he appeared in complete sleep on the chair
 tippaniyan When the turn came to speak against demonetisation, Lalu called demonetisation with the poor and Lalu lashed out at the Center and the Modi government, but Lalu's tongue slipped in the attack on Amit Shah's son Jai Shah and Lalu slammed Amit Shah Did not say anything to the son
 notebandi ke samay amit shah ke bete jai shah kii company kii kamai par sawaal khadaa kiya
 Lalu did not stop here and gave a big statement saying let us form the government, we will recruit the fourth pass people in the police and make soldiers

 The countdown to the Commonwealth Games has started, but the preparations are not taking the name of the end and this fear is now haunting everyone that if the pace of work remains the same then it will not get our nose cut during the badminton games
 australia ke melbern main pichley kaamanwealth khelon ke samaapan ke maukey par hindustan ne duniya se vaada kiya tha ki dilli main dhamal hoga
 The deadline of December 2009 was first set for the preparation of the Commonwealth Games, which was later changed to March 2010
 jab kaam puraa nahin hua to ise phir se badhaakar june 2010 kiya gaya
 Now the new deadline of 31 July has also been extended to 31 August
 lekin alam yah he ki ab bhi kai stadium adhure hai
 Due to government delays, the preparations for the Games are hanging in the balance and due to poor planning by the organizers, the honor of the country is at stake
 jawaharlal nehru stadiumhyah wo stadium jahaan se duniya dilli main kaamanwealth khelon kaa shandaar aagaaj or anjaam dekhegi
 The opening and closing ceremonies of the Games are to be held here
 saath hi yahaan atheletics kii sari ahm pratiyogitaayen bhi hona he
 Two months before the Games, the construction material scattered around this stadium was like a mouth-watering question whether the work in this most important stadium will be completed in due course of time
 jawahar laal nehru stadium ko nae sire se banane main takreeban ek hazaar karod rupye phoonk die gaye
 According to the initial deadline, the stadium was to be completed in December 2009, but even after seven months, the stadium still has 15-20 per cent work left
 kaamanwealth khelon kii kahani shuru se hi ulti rahi he
 The preparations may be at their last stage, but the plot still has not changed
 khelon ke liye sabase ahm stadium wo hota he jahaan udghaatan or samaapan samaaroh hon magar vahi stadium sabase baad main taiyaar hoga
 Yamuna Sports Complex: After the rain in Delhi, Yamuna Sports Complex was in a bad shape
 12 july ko barish or tej aandhi main yamuna sports complex stadium kii chat ud gai or barish se wooden floring buree tarah kharaab ho gaya
 The situation is that the playing field of the stadium will be ready only after 15 August
 is bich iske nirmaan kii laagat 32
 It has increased from 5 crores to 100 crores
 siri fort sports complexsirifort main bhi kaam adhura hi ho rakhaa he
 When the media wanted to enter this with the intention of making the truth known, it was banned within the media
 andar kii badahaali kaa alam log dekh nahin paaen isliye didie ne vakt se pehle hi stadium main siarpief ko tainaat kar diya he
 With the instruction that the media people should not go inside
 get par paharaa baitaakar didie ne bhale hi andar ke halaat par pardaa daal diya he, lekin andar kii baat ye he kaam abhi adhuraa he or ise puraa karne main didie ke afasaron ke paseene chhot rahe hai
 This is the reason why no DDA officer is willing to come on camera and talk
 talkatoraa stadiumhyah wo stadium he jise lekar bade-bade daawey kiye gaye the
 It has already been inaugurated on 18 July but the fact is that there is so much work left in the stadium that in two months, it will be sweaty to complete it
 jo kaam puraa ho chukaa he usamen main bhi khud endiemasi 18 khamiyaan ginava chukaa he
 For example, the bathroom above the powerhouse, the lower height of the maingate, etc
 But not a single deficiency has been removed so far
 jabaki hakeekat ye he ki inamen se kai khamiyaan suraksha ke liye khatarnaak hai
 In such a situation, the question is not just about getting the stadium ready
 bada sawaal ye he ki hadabadi main taiyaar kiye gaye ye stadium kya suraksha ke maanakon par khare utrenge
 Shivaji Stadium: Estimate how long it will take to get ready for any international sporting event in the stadium where the pavilions are still being built
 saamaanya gyaan to yahi kahata he ki ise khelon ke pehle taiyaar karnaa mushkil hi nahin naammumkin dikhataa he
 But the organizers are claiming that work is progressing steadily in the stadium
 lekin endiemasi ke daawey kii hawa nikal jaati he jab yahi sawaal ise bana rahe logon se karne par yah pataa chalata he ki ise puraa karne main do maheene or lagenge or agast main kaam puraa hona asambhav lagata he
 Khelgaon: The project on which the Commonwealth Game was first started, but after two and a half years there is still a lot of work to do
 alam ye he ki khilaadiyon ke rahane ke liye flats to jaise-taise taiyaar bhi ho jaaenge lekin practice venue kaa bhagwaan hi maalik he
 The staff quarters being built to house the technical staff are still incomplete
 yahaan kaa kaam puraa karne kii dedline march 2010 tay kii gai thi
 The company making Khelgaon has so far handed over only 25 towers out of 35 to the DDA and out of them only two towers have been furnished and submitted to the Organizing Committee
 ab dilli ke uparajyapal ne khel gaanv ke puraa hone kii nai dedline di he ek agast
 It is possible that with full force, the DDA can prepare the flats in Khelgaon
 lekin khelgaumv ke saath hi 43 karod kii laagat se ban rahe practice venue kaa kya jo tay samaysima se kaaphi peeche chal rahaa he
 The practice venue is an important part of Khelgaon, where athletic tracks, swimming pools, weightlifting and wrestling grounds are to be built for the players
 iske alaava isamen games village main thaharne vaale 8500 khilaadiyon ke liye gym, policlinics, dianing aria or dharmik sthal bhi banaaya janaa he
 But not a single thing has been prepared till now
 khel gaanv yani wo jagah jahow khilaadi sabase pehle aakar apana boria bistar rakhenge
 Even if the game village is ready by then, but looking at the practice menu with it, it seems that during the games, instead of practicing here, the players can see the work going on here from the window of their plate
 isi tarah khel gaanv ke saundaryikaran kaa kaam kis kadar adhar main he, ye chaaro taraf bikharaa malba isaki kahani khud bayaan kar rahaa he
 Commonwealth Staff Quarters: There is still half the work left
 vasantkunj main kaamanwealth staff ke liye ban rahe flats bhi badtar haalat main hai
 Four thousand flats have not yet been able to move away
 kaam yahaan bhi vakt par puraa hoga isaki ummid kam hi dikhti he or agar aisa hua to convelth khelon ke technical staff ke liye na sirf vaikalpik intazaam karnaa hoga balki suraksha kaa puraa plan bhi badalanaa padegaa
 Many projects related to the preparations for the Commonwealth Games are lagging behind and the work is being done in a hurry here
 dedline to kab kii ded ho chuki he, ab to bas ek taarikh kaa intazaar he jis din stadium kaa kaam puraa hoga
 Because now between the dates of the end of the work and the start of the game, there is not much difference between which one deadline can be named
 jab kaamanwealth khelon kii mejabani kii elaan hua to dilli waalon ko ummid jaagi thi ki aane vaale saalon main dilli kii surat badal jaaegi
 But the days are still counting in the event of the Games, but the face and color of Delhi is seen
 har taraf khudi hui sadaken or bikharaa hua malba
 Paharganj became Malabganj: Paharganj area of delhi which is famous as Hotelganj
 yahaan kaamanwealth games ke liye saundaryakaran ke naam par shuru kiye gaye projects ke naam par aisi todphod machi ki ab yahaan saans lenaa bhi mushkil he
 Projects started a year ago, as the progress progressed, instead of improving, it got worse
 sadak,siver, street lite sab taiyaariyon kii bhent chadh gaye
 Now God knows when he will become again
 haa, is kram main sthaneey kaarobaariyon kaa bantaadhaar jarur ho rahaa he
 Karol Bagh: From the crossroads to the streets of the market, everything is carved here
 karol baag main 50 karod kii laagat se 22 sadakon or 7 galiyon ko durust kiya janaa tha lekin 17 june 2010 tak yahaan keval 14 pratishat kaam hi puraa hua tha
 But now i
e
 after a month, the magical lamp of Delhi Mayor Prithviraj Sahni came to know that up to 90 percent of the work is claimed to be completed
 conotaplace conot place yani dilli kaa dil
 Under the Commonwealth Games Projects, street lighting, street scrapping, subway work were started here
 yun to endiemasi daawa kar rahi he ki 31 agast tak conot place ko chamakaa diya jayega, lekin angrezo ke jamaane ke is bazaar main bade bade gaddhe
 It is difficult to believe the broken pavement, seeing the debris spread all around
 kaamanwealth games ke projectus hai yaa birbal kii khichdi, jo pak kar taiyaar hi nahi ho rahe he
 These projects, which have been running for a year and a half, are still in a state, so it is difficult to say whether they will be completed even by this new deadline
 haa agar sarkaar ke haath aladdeen kaa chiraag lag jaae to shaayad, use ghis kar dilli ko chamkaaya ja saktaa he
 But the question is not just about polishing
 us chamak ke saath aane vaali pareshaaniyon kaa bhi he
 Planning which has not been thought of as a solution
 Water gathering
 CSC scientist Sushmita says that the problem of water logging will increase in the coming days

 yadi aap bhi maanate hai ki jiesti (guds and services tex) ke lagu hone ke baad kaarobaar karnaa saans lene jitna aasaan ho jayega or paratdaar taxon ke jariye badaae vaali mahangaai se mukti mil jaaegi, to aap ko ek baar centre sarkaar ke model jiesti kanoon ko jarur padhuya chahie, jo jiesti kaa aadhaar banegaa or jise sansad ke aagaamee satr main manjuur karaane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 Three objectives of tax reform We know that the laws of the government are not readable at all
 lekin kathinata or pech-paraton ke baavjood is kanoon ko padhuya jaruri he
 It will be known from reading this that the GST coming out of this law is not India's biggest tax reform but it is equipped with the dangers of becoming a big problem
 jiesti kanoon ke makadzaal main utarate hue yah yaad rakhana jaruri he ki is kar sudhaar ke teen makasad hai: pehla, puure desh main darjanon tex hai jo bharat ko ek kaaman market banane main sabase badi baadha hai
 GST will levy a tax at the same rate on production, sales and services across the country and India will turn into a seamless market
 doosraa, bhaanti-bhaanti ke tex mahangaai badhaate hai, jiesti ke tahat, custom duty ke alaava centre or rajyon ke sabhi indirect tex (exise, sarvice, waite, chungi aadi) ek saath milaae jaaenge jisase tex kii prabhavi dar kam hogi
 Under this, manufacturers and service providers will be taxed at different levels of production and service, which will result in only one tax on the final product or service and reduce inflation
 teesraa, jiesti ek sahaj tex prashasan lekar aayega jisamen kaarobaar karnaa behad aasaan ho jayega
 The biggest indicator of traders is that the index of expectations regarding GST has always skyrocketed for these three reasons
 lekin in ummiido se prabhavit koi vyakti agar jiesti kanoon ko padhe to vah isamen aadhunik tex system or kaarobaar kii sahajata talashta rah jayega
 GST is evidence that the law is exactly the opposite of what governments are saying
 isamen ek nahin balki kai aise praavdhaan hai jo bhavishyonmukhi or aadhunik tex dhaancha dene ke bajaae maujuuda tex pranali ko hi kai saal peeche dhakel sakate hai
 Take the tax registration, which is the basic aspect of taxation, and is the biggest breath of businessmen
 yah kanoon lagu hua to darjanon tex registration karaane honge
 Under the proposed three-tier tax (central, State, Integrated) framework of GST, those who sell or supply goods across the country will have to register three separate registrations in each state and keep a separate account of tax by filing separate returns
 jiesti kaarobaar ko kaise aasaan karegaa?yahi nahin, agar koi company kai tarah ke kaarobaar karti he to sabhi kaarobaaron kaa alag-alag panjikaran hoga
 Now only this government can tell how GST will make business easier after numerous registrations and arrangements for returns
 The fact is that this single provision of registration in GST will derail the entire reform as the cost of compliance with tax rules in India is already high, which can increase manifold after GST
 ek or praavdhaan kaabilegaur he jo desh main alag-alag rajyon main sanchaalan karne vaali companiyon yaa pratishthanon par baari padegaa
 Under the GST Act, if a company sends goods or services to any branch or unit of its own, it will be taxed
 maal yaa seva paane vaali ikai is tex kii vaapasi ke liye baad main daawa karegi
 This provision is a tribute to the hopes of GST becoming a common market in the country
 jiesti ke milane vaale phaaydon kii raah main sabase bada rodinput tex credit jiesti kii jaan he, jiske tahat utpaadan yaa aapurti ke dauraan kachche maal yaa seva par chukaaye gaye tex kii vaapasi hoti he
 This system eliminates the effect of repeated taxation on a production or service, but the provision related to it is unique
 jiesti act kahata he ki saplir ne sarkaar ko tex nahin chukaaya he to us seva yaa kachche maal kaa istemaal karne vaala nirmaataa tex credit kaa daawa nahin kar sakegaa
 This provision will be the biggest obstacle in the way of the benefits of GST
 exise or sarvice tex kanoonon main jatil paribhaashaon or praavdhaanon ke kaaran supreme court, hycourt, tribunelon or apil kamishanron ke paas 1
 More than 20 lakh cases are pending
 jiesti kanoon main bhi asangatiyon or pechdaar paribhaashaon kii bahutayat he jo kanoonee jatiltaayen badhayengi or manamaane notice bhejne kaa mauka dengi
 Whatever the government claims, reading the model act of GST, it is not difficult to understand that the authorities have made the GST law a bundle of inconsistencies in the old custom, excise, services and VAT laws
 ummid yah thi ki jiesti ke jariye aadhunik, sahaj or doordarshee tex system milegaa
 After seeing this law, the expectations of ease of doing business in GST have been sidelined
 rahi baat samekit kar dhaanche kii to teen stareey jiesti main na stamp duty shaamil hogi, na motor vehical tex or kuch rajyon main to chungi shaamil hone par bhi shaq he
 Tax on petrol and diesel will be in addition to GST
 mandi, rajyon ke rajasav main giravat or vetan ayog ke kaaran bade kharchon kii vajah se jiesti kii dar oonchi hi rahani he
 The average rate of indirect tax is currently 24 per cent, given that the GST rate can be between 18 and 20 per cent, which means that the service tax rate will increase by four to six per cent and excise duty VAT will also increase at many levels
 
 jiesti kii raajnneeti nahin balki iskaa arthshaastra, kriyanvayan or prashasan mahatvapurn he
 Whatever political expectations the restless government may have to show revolutionary reforms, but the way GST is taking shape, it can open up avenues of anomalies and chaos in the entire tax system rather than economic opportunities
 ummid he ki hamaare netaa itane samvedansheel sudhaar ko lekar 'aa bail mujhe maar' nahin karenge

 For immediate damage control, the government sent Thakur IPS officer Omkar Singh, posted in Ballia, to form the SSP of Meerut
 iske baavjood is birdari main sapa sarkaar ke virodh main gussa thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa tha
 One of the major reasons for the Thakurs' anger is the handing over of insignificant posts one by one to the Thakur leaders who hold a ministerial position in the government
 raja bhaiya ko mantri pad se hataane ke pehle unase karagaar jaisaa mahatvapurn mahakama chhinakar sapa ke pradesh pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ko de diya gaya tha
 Apart from this, Raja Aridaman Singh was shifted from the cabinet minister of the family department to the insignificant department like stamp and duty, and similarly Thakur voters from SP were angry after another cabinet minister Omprakash Singh's department was diluted
 bijepi pravaktaa chandra mohan singh bataate hai ki pashchimi jilon main hue dangon main thakuron par maraham lagane ke liye sapa ne raja bhaiya kaa sahaara liya he, jiskaa koi phayda milane vaala nahin he
 Singh says that by including Raja Bhaiya in the cabinet, the SP has once again proved that the tainted people will get all kinds of protection in this government
 ’udhar, raja bhaiya ko mantrimandal main shaamil karne ke baavjood sapa kii mushkilen kam nahin hui hai
 a day before Raja Bhaiya's swearing in on Friday, SP Lok Sabha member Brij Bhushan from Kaiserganj seat refused to contest the next Lok Sabha election as a SP candidate
 purvanchal main thakur birdari main khaasi paith rakhane vaale brijabhooshan ke achaanak liye gaye is nirnay se sapa netritv sakate main he
 Brij Bhushan contested on BJP ticket in 1991 and 1999 and it is expected that he is preparing to return to BJP
 brijabhooshan ke kareebi ek netaa bataate hai ki brijabhooshan ke bijepi main lautne par unhen gonda sansadeey kshetra se kendriya ispaat mantri benny prasad verma ke saamne utaara ja saktaa he
 However, sp's State Spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary ignores the possibility of any leader leaving the SP
 choudhary kehete hai ‘ sapa kaa janaadhar lagaataar bad rahaa he
 If a leader is unhappy about something, he will be persuaded
 ’ In the Malegaon blast case, a former government lawyer reprimanded BJP leader Pragya Thakur for claiming that he was tortured during the investigation by a team led by 26 / 11 hero Hemant Karkare
 do din pehle, 2008 ke mumbai aatankwaadi hamalon ke dauraan aatankwaadiyon kii firing main shahid hue police adhikari hemanth karkare ko lekar maalegaanv blast kii aaropee pragna thakur ne vivaadit bayaan diya tha
 Pragya Thakur said that he cursed the martyr Karkare, which led to his death
 pragna thakur ne kaha ki 'hemanth karkare rashtravirohi the
 He was against religion (anti-religion)
 aap is baat par vishwaas nahin karenge, lekin maine kaha tha ki 'tumhaara sarvanaash hoga'
 Shortly thereafter, he was shot by the terrorists
 haalanki, baad main apane bayaan par ghirne ke baad or aalochanaon ke bich pragna ne apni apmanjanak tippanee waapas le lee
 Pragya Thakur has accused the police of committing severe atrocities several times during the investigation of Malegaon blast case
 bataa den ki maalegavan blast main 6 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Let us know that Pragya Thakur is contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Bhopal on a BJP ticket
 is cese kii purv sarkari vakil rohinee saalyan ne spasht kiya ki pragna thakur ko yatnaa dene yaa avaidh hiraasat main rakhane kaa court ko koi saboot nahin mila
 i never heard that a Sadhvi cursed and someone died
 ye tippaniyan (hemanth karkare ke khilaaf) anuchit or bina soche samajhe hai
 i think she is doing this for publicity because she is contesting elections
 is tarah kii avaanchit tippaniyan ghatiya hai
 Former lawyer Salian pointed out that the court had not found any evidence of torture or illegal detention in Pragya Thakur's case
 isliye unhone (abhiyukt) ne ucch nyaayalay main faisle ko chunauti di thi, jisamen medical report sahit sabhi record the, magar iske baad bhi unki yachika khaarij kar di gai
 Former lawyer Rohini Salyan also dismissed bjp's allegation that its Bhopal candidate Sadhvi Pragya was implicated by the previous Congress government
 unhone kaha ki 'donon abhiyukton ko aakhri baar bhopal main pragna thakur ke saath dekha gaya tha, is baat ke bhi saboot hai
 Sadhvi Pragya's vehicle (a scooter) was lying in the same premises where she was staying
 ant main, is scooter ko blast kii jagah par le jaaya gaya or vahaan istemaal kiya gaya
 The government lawyer said that he recused himself from the case in 2015 as the National Investigation Agency started pressuring him to soften the case
 tab tak, main adaalat main apane kanoonee kartavyon ko puraa karne ke liye swatantra thi
 However, working under such conditions was difficult
 salian ne kaha ki vah aatankwaadi hamalon ke din hemanth karkare se milane vaali antim vyakti thim
 She said that i am speaking for one purpose only today, because i cannot allow the brave police officers to be maligned
 sansad kii canteen main khatm hogi sabcidibijness adwiseri cameti main sabhi dalon main sahmati17 karod rupee salanaa he canteen kaa bajtsansad kii canteen main saansadon ko milane vaali sabsidi ab khatm ho sakati he

 Most parties have agreed on this
 loksabhaa spikar om birla ke suzav ke baad bijness adwiseri cameti ne is mudde par charchaa kii thi
 In which all the parties have agreed on this issue
 agar sansad kii canteen se sabsidi ko hataa diya jaataa he to isamen 17 karod rupee salanaa kii bachat hogi
 Let us know that the price of food in the canteen was increased in the last Lok Sabha and the subsidy bill was reduced
 lekin ab sabsidi ko puri tarah se khatm karne kii taiyaari he
 Subsidies received in the canteen of Parliament have been a part of controversies many times
 beete dinon sansad kii canteen kii rate list bhi viral hui thi
 Under the subsidy, food was available at a very low price in the Parliament canteen of the mps of the country
 sansad kii rate listbata den ki 2017-18 tak sansad main chikan kari 50 rupee, plane dosa 12 rupee, veg thali 35 rupee or thri course lunch 106 rupee main miltaa tha
 This subsidized rate list was only for mps
 india today ke dwaara daayar RTI ke jawaab main jab 2017-18 kii rate list saamne ai thi, to usamen sabsidi ke taur par milane vaale khaane ke daam kaa pataa chalaa tha
 Significantly, this demand was being raised for a long time that mps eat cheap food on taxpayer money
 haal hi main jab jawahar laal nehru uniwarsity main chaatr hostel fees badhotaree ke khilaaf pradarshan kar rahe the, tab bhi unhone is tark ko saamne rakhaa tha
 Students had demanded that when subsidies are not available in studies, then why mps get subsidy in food

 In response, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge said that it is the job of the government to run the house, but which government has no intention of running the Parliament
 sansad kaa bajet satr 6 taarikh ko khatm ho rahaa he or karrwai chalane ke liye ab sirf 5 din baaki hai lekin satta paksh or vipaksh ke rup ko dekhakar aisa nahin lagata ki agle hafte bhi sansad main koi kaamkaaj ho paaegaa
 This is the first time when the government passed the entire finance bill without arguing for even a minute
 sarkaar ke paastin talaksamet tamaam bill pade hai jinhen sarkaar is satr main paas karana chaahati thi, lekin ab aisa nahin lagata ki is satr main koi kaamkaaj ho sakegaa

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main pehali baar bhartiya janata party (bijepi ) ne congress se zyada ummidavaar utaare hai
 In the 2019 elections, 437 BJP candidates are in the Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne 427 siton par chunaav ladaa tha or isamen se 282 siton par use jeet mili thi
 At the same time, Congress had fielded candidates for a total of 450 Lok Sabha seats across the country
 congress 450 se zyada siton par chunaav ladi lekin saxes rate dekha jaae to kaaphi kam rahaa
 Congress could not even reach 50 seats in this election
 congress ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa or use mahaj 44 siten milin
 Modi wave was the major reason for bjp's victory in 2014 elections
 1996 se 2014 tak ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bhaajapa kaa saxes rate dekhen to iskaa graph sirf 2009 main ek baar hi congress se neeche gaya he
 Political experts believe that BJP has worked continuously for many years on how to strengthen its hold on seats
 2014 ke baad bhaajapa kii pakad puure desh main faili he
 Due to its expansion, the BJP is contesting more seats than the Congress
 bhaajapa, andhra pradesh or telugana main endie ke sahyogiyon kaa saath chhod is baar sabhi siton par akele chunaav lard rahi he
 Whereas, Congress is contesting fewer seats this time than BJP as it has tied up with more parties than in 2014
 use siten baantni pad rahi he
 The Congress is giving up seats on many seats without mutual consent

 But in 2014 it won its highest number of 282 seats

 The reason why i respect & love this man is bc of his humbleness khagolvigyaan or jyotish donon main hi chandragrahan ek khaas ghatana he haalanki grahan ko lekar kai tarah ke myth bhi prachlit hai
 There is a fear in the minds of people even today that a lunar eclipse can cause harm if viewed with naked eyes
 ankhon kii roshni kam ho sakati hai yaa phir puri tarah se kharaab ho sakati he
 On 27 July 2018, the longest lunar eclipse of this century is falling, which many people have keenness and fear to see
 mid north coast estronaumi ke david reneke kaa kahana he ki yah ek khubasurat akashiya ghatana hogi or ise kisi ko bhi miss nahin karnaa chahie
 He said, lunar eclipse is different from solar eclipse and it is absolutely safe to see it with naked eyes
 ise dekhne ke liye kisi bhi tarah ke protective filters kii bhi jarurat nahin padati he, ise dekhne ke liye sirf or sirf aapako apni do ankhon kaa istemaal karnaa hoga lekin kisi bhi tarah ke chamkile prakaash ko dekhne se bachein
 Let us tell you that during solar eclipse, due to solar radiation, delicate tissue damage to the eyes can occur, due to which there can be difficulty in seeing
 ise retinal sanbern bhi kehete hai
 This problem can happen for some time or forever
 lekin chandra grahan ke dauraan aisa nahin hota
 On this day, there is no harm in seeing the moon with open eyes
 aap chaahe to khule maidan yaa phir paas ke kisi park main jaakar chand kaa didaar kar sakate hai
 Gurugram Police has started a campaign to protect people violating traffic rules in Gurugram on the occasion of Rakshabandhan
 iske tahat kisi bhi vyakti dwaara trephic niyamon kaa ulanghan karte paae jane par use mahila police kii jawanrakhibandhakar niyamon ke prati jaagruk karengi
 The Smart Police of Gurugram has started this effort to teach a lesson to those who break the traffic rules and make them aware of the traffic rules
 ise rakshabandhan ke maukey par aise logon ko jaagruk karne ke liye shuru kiya gaya he jo aam taur par trephic niyamon kaa ulanghan karte hai or apane liye to khatra badhaate hi hai, saath hi duusare logon ke liye bhi pareshaani kaa sabab banate hai
 To make such people mentally aware of traffic rules, now the women police personnel will tie rakhi to such people on behalf of Gurugram Police
 unhen trephic niyamon kaa paath padhaayengi
 Gurugrampolis has run this campaign earlier also
 jisamen isi tarah trephic niyamon kaa paalan nahin karne vaale logon ko raakhi baandhi gai thi
 This time too, this campaign will be conducted till Sunday to tighten the noses and make them aware at several square intersections of Gurugram where people violate most of the traffic rules
 gurugram police trephic ko lekar kai aisi muhim chalaa rahi he
 At the same time, its main purpose is that people should be aware of traffic rules and do not violate them
 aise prayaas logon ko maansik taur par kaaphi prabhaav daalate hai yahi kaaran he ki police ne is yojana ko taiyaar kiya he
 After remaining quiet for almost a year, Kim Jong-un started speaking poisonous words again as the new year approached
 uttar korea ke taanashaah ne america ko ek baar phir chetavanee di he ki agar uske mulk par lageen paabandiyaan nahin hataai gayi to wo apane vaadon ko bhul jayega
 And will leave the path of Aman and get involved in the arms race again and if this happens, then the situation in the Korean Peninsula will again become the same as it was a year ago

 itnaa hi nahin kim jong un ne america or dakshin korea ke bich hone vaale saajha sainya abhyaas ko bhi band karne kii dhamkee di he
 Kim has said that the US should now stop common military exercises
 kyonki uttar korea ne dakshin korea ke saath bhi apane sambandhon ko sudhara he

 mayawati ne mangalvaar subah ek ke baad ek teen twit kiye
 He first tweeted, 'the Congress Party government in Rajasthan has once again broken the BSP mlas and proved to be a non-trustworthy and fraudulent party
 yah basapa movement ke saath vishwasghaat he jo dobaaraa tab kiya gaya he jab basapa vahaan congress sarkaar ko baahar se bina shart samarthan de rahi thi
 In his second tweet, the BSP leader said, 'congress, instead of fighting against its bitter party / organizations, always acts to shock those parties which support / support them
 congress is prakaar essi, asti, obisi virdohi party he tathaa in virgon ke aarakshan ke haq ke prati kabhi gambhir evam eemaandaar nahin rahi he
 '2
 congress apni katu virdohi party / sanghathanon se ladane ke bajaae har jagah un partiyon ko hi sadaa aghat pahunchane kaa kaam karti he jo unhen sahyog / samarthan dete hai
 The Congress is thus an anti-sc, ST, OBC party and has never been sincere and honest about the right to reservation of these classes
 3
 The Congress has always been opposed to Babasaheb Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar and his humanitarian ideology
 isi kaaran da ambedkar ko desh ke pehle kanoon mantri pad se istipha dena padaa tha
 The Congress neither allowed him to go to the Lok Sabha nor conferred with Bharataratna
 ati-dukhad va sharmnaak
 After this, another tweet said, 'congress is always Baba Saheb Dr
 bhimrao ambedkar evam unki maanavtaavaadi vichaardhaara kii virdohi rahi
 This is why Dr
 ambedkar ko desh ke pehle kanoon mantri pad se istipha dena padaa tha
 The Congress neither allowed him to go to the Lok Sabha nor conferred with Bharataratna
 ati-dukhad evam sharmnaak
 'let me tell you, all the six mlas of Bahujan Samajwadi Party in Rajasthan have joined Congress

 Six BSP mlas submitted a letter to the Speaker, Speaker CP Joshi late on Monday night
 vidhayakon ne bina shart congress main shaamil hone kii baat kahi he
 The BSP has six mlas Rajendra Singh Gudha (udaipur Wati), Jogendra Singh Awana (nadbai), Wajib Ali (nagar), Lakhan Singh (karauli), Sandeep Kumar (tijara) and Deepchand Kheria (kishangarh Bass)
 rajasthan ke vidhansabha adhyaksh ne jaipur main der raat pitiai bhashaa se kaha ki basapa vidhayakon ne unase mulaakaat kii or ek patr unhen saunpa he
 Vasudev Kolhtkar told that he has been a science teacher and has made a lab here for the children so that they can come here after school and practice
 lekin meraa dimag baahar tange us board par tha, jis par likhaa tha kirthan shaala
 Several types of kirtan were mentioned on this board
 vaigyanik kirthan, rashtriya kirthan, brahm nirupak kirthan, bhagwat saptaah kathan, pravachan puraana kathan or vigyaan katha
 Two more boards were installed outside the house
 ek par likhaa tha ganit mandir or duusare par vigyaan mandir
 Seeing the same house of kirtan and science was astonishing, otherwise what is a journalist made for
 kolhatkar sahab apni katha sunaane lagate hai or main aapke liye likhane lagata hum
 'my father Vasudev Kolhatkar was a kirtanakar
 unheen kii parampara ko main aage badha rahaa hum
 The tradition of Kirtan in Maharashtra is very old and completely different from North India or the rest of India
 shesh bharat ke kirthan main sirf kavita style main hoti he, lekin marathi main kavita or gadhy donon hi shaileyon main kirthan hota he
 Sant Namdev, Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Tukaram laid the foundation of a great tradition of kirtan, which had devotion
 inhen varkari kirthan kaha jaataa he
 There is another Kirtan
 naradiya kirthan
 Narada laid the foundation for a different tradition of kirtan
 jisamen gyaan buddhi or chaaron sutron kii jaankaree hoti thi
 Religion, Artha, Kama and Moksha
 naradiya kirthan main vigyaan bhi hota tha
 'kolhtkar sir later gave me all this information through email also so that i can understand in more detail
 kirthan ke do hisse hote hai
 East color and North color
 kolhatkar sahab kehete hai ki yah hamaara daayitv he ki ham puraani parampara ko aaj kii zaruuraton se jod den
 Therefore, i also tell about the first atom, time, gravity in the previous color of Kirtan
 uske baad duusare hisse main rishi gautam, rishi canad, maitreyi, ke saath instine, galileo, kepler, maaikel farade or newton ke bare main bhi gaata hum
 Kolhtkar sahab sang to us the story of Newton in Marathi prose style
 bhashaa to kam samajha magar bhav se samajha ki ve dharm or vigyaan ko jodate hue bataa rahe hai ki newton bahut dharmik tha
 Not only this, they also start taking photographs of Newton's life and discovery
 bataate hai ki uske jivan main jo ghatana ghati uskaa sambandh dharm se kaise tha
 These characters are mentioned so that people can be made aware through stories in support of time, gravity in the previous colors
 kolhatkar sahab, bhakthi, gyaan vigyaan, hasya-vyangy ke bhav se vigyaan kirthan ko kaaphi rochak bana dete hai
 Told me that most of the kirtans they do in the temple
 mandir main hi aane vaale bhakton ko vigyaan katha sunaate hai
 They have been performing this type of kirtan since the 1980s
 behad shant swabhaav or kam chizon kaa upbhog karne vaale kolhatkar sahab kii jeevanstyli bhi kisi sant ke jaisi hi lagi
 Kolhtkar saheb said that countless topics can be associated with kirtan
 magar zyaadaatar sirf bhakthi tak hi simat kar rah gaye hai
 i have chosen the path of scientific kirtan
 main bhashkaracharya or aryabhatta kii katha bhi sunaata hum or archemedes kii bhi
 Right now, with the knowledge of science kirtan, my mind was full that an old book was shown on his table
 jiske pehle panne par likhaa tha abraham katha
 Now my curiosity had reached the tenth floor
 kolhatkar sahab ne bataaya ki yah yahudee kirthan he or is par stenford vishvavidhyalay kii ana shultz (anna Schultz) research kar rahi hai
 a book has also come out of Ana, titled Singing a Hindu Nation (2004)
 Ana also accidentally collided with Abraham Katha during her research
 maine unka video lacture suna he, jise unhone stenford vishvavidhyalay main diya he
 This lecture should be heard
 marathi parampara main sangeet ke zarie yahudee pahchaan kii sangharsh yatra adbhut he
 i have summarized the Abraham story from the same lecture that i am writing for you briefly
 maharashtra main hindu kirthan kii parampara bahut puraani he
 The Marathi Jews of Bombay, known as Ben Israelis, were searching for a way of their identity among the Hindu society here
 use jataane kaa zariyaa dhund rahe the
 One day Manjhgaonkar and three of his fellow Hindu Kirtankars Rao Sahib Shankar were returning from the Kirtan Sabha of Pandurang Pandit
 raav sahab kaa asar itnaa zyaada tha ki in teenon ne yahudee kirthan kii parampara shuru karne kii thaan lee or 1880 main kirthan uttejk mandal kii sthapana kii
 From there this tradition has traveled with the Marathi Jewish people to Israel
 ana shultaj ne bataaya ki hindu mandiron main gaaye jane vaale kirthan se yahudee kirthan kii dhara nikalne kii gaatha pahchaan kii yatraaon ke kai sankaton se nikalati he
 Indian Jews then struggled to identify themselves with British Christians and in the national movement
 shuru main duusare dharm kii style ko apnaane ko lekar kaaphi satarkta barti gai, magar hindu kirthan kaa bhav puri tarah aa hi gaya
 Despite the fact that when the missionaries translated the songs of Abraham Katha written in Marathi, they replaced the names of Western instruments with the names of Indian instruments
 yahudee auraton ne in kirtanon ke zariye hindu padosiyon or auraton ke saamne yah jataane kaa prayaas kiya ki ham bhi kam bhartiya nahin hai
 Christian missionaries also translated the Bible into Marathi to impress Marathi Jews, but that did not happen even then
 yahudee kirthan unki sthaneey jivan or pahchaan kaa hissaa banataa hi chalaa gaya
 When the Jewish kirtan was first sung in 1880, it was greatly welcomed by the Jewish community
 unki chintaa bas itani thi ki hamaari apni samskruti na khatm ho jaae
 For this Manjhgaonkar made seven rules
 jaise hindu kirtankaron kii tarah bhagwaan vitthal kii vandana nahin kerani he, charan sparsh nahin karnaa he or daan vagairah nahin dena
 Even after these rules, the Jewish kirtan remained tied within the kirtan style grooves in the singing style
 ek tarah se indo-israeli sangeet kii dhara kaa janm hone laga
 Between 1880 and 1990, 35 Bene Ben Israeli Kirtan songs were published
 abraham charitra kaa gayan bilkul bhartiya sangeet style main hota he
 It still happens today
 yah sab jaankaree maine ana shultj ke video lacture se likhi he
 Many people can use this information in many ways, but the truth is that in the past the currents have crossed through the boundaries of religion and identity and a vast culture has been born
 acha yahi hoga ki vartmaan ateet ke in kisson ko samskruti ke anginat rachanakaaron ke rup main pahachaanen

 arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party desh kii rajdhani main raajnneeti kaa cheharaa badalane ko taiyaar he
 Delhi will see many things like cabinet meeting in front of the public, special session of Delhi Assembly at Ramlila Maidan, monthly Mohalla meetings to decide the expenses
 jise netaaon ne kuch samay pehle 'ek murkh kaa sapana' kaha tha, vah ab hakeekat banane ja rahaa he
 On Monday, the Aam Aadmi Party claimed to form the government in Delhi
 arvind kejariwal mukhyamantri honge
 In a special conversation with India Today, he said that he wants to become a Revolutionary ie 'revolutionary' Chief Minister who will not compromise his principles
 unhone kaha, 'desh main ek manyata he ki aap satta main bane rahane ke liye samjhaute karte hai
 People think that it is impossible to be revolutionary while in a chair
 main isse sahamat nahin hum
 Sardar Patel and Lal Bahadur Shastri were very practical leaders, but they were revolutionary even while in power
 'constructive siem bananaa he, distroctive nahinkejariwal lage haath yah bhi kah dete hai ki revolushni hone kaa matlab 'distroctive' yani sab kuch todane vaala nahin hota
 He said, 'I want to work with missionary enthusiasm but this does not mean that my approach will be destructive
 main constructive tareeke se kaam karnaa chahta hum dilli ke logon ko saath lekar
 The most important thing for the Chief Minister is the sense of service of the people
 agar ilaake main anyaay ho rahaa he to mukhyamantri ko dard hona chahie
 If he does not suffer from the pain of the public, then he will just keep clearing the file
 ''chand par jo gaya vah aam aadmi hi tha'congress or bijepi ke senior netaa kejariwal ko unke bade-bade vaade puure karne kii chunauti de rahe hai
 The leaders of both parties are sure that the Aam Aadmi Party will not be able to run an effective government in Delhi and it will be open till the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin raajnneetik diggajon ko pehle bhi galat sabit kar chuke kejariwal is morche par bhi aatmavishvaas se labarej najar aate hai
 He said, 'running the government is not a big deal
 koi mukhyamantri paidaa nahin hota
 Everyone has their first experience
 rajanetaaon ko yah nahin sochna chahie ki desh kaa aam aadmi kamjor he
 The common man of this country knows how to cook, dress and build a house
 chand par jo gaya vah aam aadmi hi tha
 The common man will also show it by running the government
 ''kai export hamen salaah denge'kejariwal ne mana ki unke vidhayak gaiyr-anbhavi hai lekin daleel di ki shashan chalaane kaa anubhav na hone kaa yah matlab nahin he ki ham sarkaar nahin chalaa paaenge
 He said, 'what did Arvinder Lovely do in the field of education before becoming the Minister of Education? Rajkumar Chauhan was the food minister
 unhone mantri banane se pehle apane ilaake main kya kiya tha? ham ek eemaandaar sarkaar banaaenge
 There are many experts who can give suggestions to the government
 pani kii samasya ko hi le lijie
 The government will contact experts who have done a lot of work in different areas
 pichhali sarkaar kii niyat eemaandaar nahin thi
 So things did not go well
 main khush hum ki mere paas vaisaa anubhav nahin he, jaisaa netaaon ke paas he
 'electricity and water biggest challenge Kejriwal has made a complete plan to fulfill the promises made in the party's manifesto
 unhen maaloom he ki unhen jo bhi karnaa he, bahut kam samay main karnaa hoga kyonki march ke baad loksabhaa chunaavon ke maddenjar aachaar samhita lagu ho jaaegi
 Water and electricity are the two most important issues
 kejariwal agar bijli-pani se jude apane 50 fisadi vaade bhi puure kar paae to agle chunaav main iskaa inaam janata unhen degi
 In the last few days, many retired officers from Delhi Jal Board and power companies have met Kejriwal and informed about the ongoing mess in these departments
 in adhikariyon ne kejariwal ko apni ore se kai suzav bhi die
 'we do not have all the intelligence'
 Aam Aadmi Party government will stand on the concept of 'swaraj'
 kejariwal maanate hai ki janata tak jane se raajnneeti main krantikari badlaav aayega
 He said, 'we have to involve the public in the decision making process
 tabhi chijen sudharengi
 If four people sitting in a closed room will claim that they have answers to everything, then nothing will be right
 sari budhimaani hamaare hi paas he, aisi koi galatfahami hamane nahin paal rakhi he
 There are many people who have solutions for public problems
 agar aap unase milen or faisle lene main unhen shaamil karen to koi samasya nahin he jo nahin sulajh sakati
 'mohalla meetings will be decentralized of politics
 Aam Aadmi Party is preparing to hold Mohalla meetings in the entire state
 in sabhaaon main maheene ke kisi ek ravivaar ko sthaneey log jutenge or ilaake kii praathamiktaayen tay karenge
 Kejriwal says, “earlier people used to run to go to the MLA, now the MLA will go among the public himself
 logon ko sarkaar ke liye maheene main bas ek din kaa samay nikaalnaa hoga
 The Mohalla Sabha will be held in a park in the area, where people will come and tell what work should be done in their area
 bahumat jis kaam ke paksh main hoga, vahi hoga
 Contractors will not be paid until the locals themselves check the quality of the work
 ''logon kii baari-bharkam ummiido se dar jaataa hum'kejariwal ke kandhon par jimmedaari ab or bhi badhane vaali he
 He says, 'sometimes i get scared how much people expect from me
 mujhe nahin pataa ki ham sarkaar chalaane main safal honge yaa nahin
 i pray to God that we succeed
 par hamaara bhagya hamaare vash main nahin he
 Although our work is under our control
 ham ishwar se prarthana karte hai ki ve hamen saahas or lagan de ki ham logon kii ummiido par khara utar saken
 "trust in God has returned" Arvind Kejriwal said that his faith in God has returned in the last few months
 unhone bataaya, 'main bahut dharmik parivaar se aata hum
 But while studying at IIT Kharagpur, my attitude turned scientific and i became an atheist
 lekin pichley teen saalon main jo kuch hua he, usase dobaaraa ishwar main meraa vishwaas bana he
 Anna sat on hunger strike and a big movement was born
 jo kuch hua usase mujhe anubhav hua ki main kitna chota aadmi hum

 Bihar has become the first state in the country to continue reservation in the private sector, where private companies have been brought under the purview of reservation
 yani bihar main ab nijee companiyon ko aarakshan ke niyamon kaa paalan karnaa hoga
 The reservation rules will be applicable in the selection of employees to whom the state government outsources and companies will have to follow it
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke is faisle par cabinet ne bhi muhar laga di he
 Earlier, companies outsource the personnel in different departments as per their requirement, but after the new rules are implemented, in such jobs to implement the reservation provision made for SC, ST, Backward Class, Extremely Backward, Disabled and Women
 Will happen
 haalanki bihar sarkaar ke is faisle kaa virodh hona bhi shuru ho gaya he
 Senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP CP Thakur has described it as a wrong move
 seepi thakur ke anusaar padhai-likhaai main aarakshan dena to thik he, par naukariyon ke liye unhen yogya banane par jor dena chahie
 So that their efficiency cannot be questioned
 unka maananaa he ki isse sarkaar kaa kaamkaaj bhi prabhavit hoga
 Two Dalit leaders of Chief Minister Nitish Kumarki Party Janata Dal u had raised their finger on the functioning of the government in the past on reservation
 mana ja rahaa he ki dal main apane aap ko upekshit mahasoos kar rahe purv vidhansabha adhyaksh udaynarayan choudhary or purv mantri shyaam rajak ne is aarakshan ke mudde ko uthaakar apni raajnneeti chamakaani chaahi
 RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav also strongly supported both of them on this issue
 lekin nitish kumaar ke is master stroke se ab unke paas sarkaar ko badhai dene ke alaava or koi chaara nahin bachaa he
 Shyam Razak, a senior leader of the Janata Dal U, was a minister in the last term, but is angry due to not being made a minister in this term
 jabaki janata dal you ke netaa udai narayan choudhary ko party ne do turm vidhansabha adhyaksh banaaya, lekin is baar wo purv mukhyamantri jeethanram maanjhi se chunaav haar gaye
 In such a situation, his height in the party also decreased
 duusari ore congress ke purv pradesh adhyaksh or dalit netaa ashok choudhary ke janata dal you main aane kii khabar se bhi donon dalit netaa pareshaan the
 Janata dal-u spokesperson Neeraj Kumar says the party does not take decisions under pressure from anyone
 daliton ke utthan ke liye nitish kumaar ne mahadalit banaaya or kai yojaanen lagu kin
 If the matter is to implement reservation in the outsourced matter, then the decision of the BJP and the leaders of the Janata Dal u has taken the decision jointly under the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar

 If i have made a mistake, you can punish

 Since then, he has given the most importance to the campaign against purity and corruption in public life

 Last time he resigned as Union Minister, all the Members of Parliament were advising him not to do so
 lekin unhone kisi kii baat nahin maani

 lekin party netritv ne unase yah mantralay sanbhaalane ko kaha ki kyonki yah mantralay raksha saudon ke kaaran vivaadon main rahata he
 Antony said he met the military leadership after assuming the post of defense minister and made it clear that he was in favor of modernization but corruption would not be tolerated even at all
 unhone kaha ki raksha kharid ke kisi bhi charan main yadi bhrashtachar kii baat sabit huyi to puure saude ko radd kar diya jayega
 He said that he takes every complaint seriously and sends it to the army through the Ministry of Defense so that the allegations can be traced and action taken as per the need
 unhone kaha ki vah gumnaam shikayaton kii bhi andekhi nahin karte

 Other companies complain when a contract is awarded to a company
 lekin mantralay kisi bhi shikaayat kii andekhi nahin karata
 Antony said that last year we spent 100 percent of the defense procurement budget
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vah raksha sauda prakriya tantra ko durust karne par bhi vichaar kar rahe hai
 Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley, seeking clarification from the Defense Minister, said that the cases of the Army and the Ministry of Defense, which have been coming up for some time, are disturbing

 During the Lok Sabha elections, BJP national president Amit Shah promised to remove Articles 370 and 35A from Jammu and Kashmir
 buudhvaar ko sadan main jab saansad prabhaat jha, chaaya verma, sukhram singh yadav or vishambar prasad nishad ne isko lekar sawaal kiya
 The government responded, but this answer does not explain the government's stand on this issue
 grih mantralay kii ore se die jawaab main haa bhi nahin kaha gaya or isse inkaar bhi nahi kiya gaya
 In fact, the mps had asked what is the government's stand on Articles 370 and 35A
 aatankwaad ke khatme ke liye sarkaar ne kya ranneeti banaai he
 BJP MP Prabhat Jha asked in Rajya Sabha - Does Article 370 give special status to Jammu and Kashmir
 dephence, videsh or vittiya maamalon ko chhodkar anya saare kaaryon ke liye kya centre ko rajya sarkaar kii manjuuri leni padati he
 Is Article 370 a hindrance in the development of Jammu and Kashmir
 agar yah desh kii ekta or akhandta ke liye bhi khatra he to kya sarkaar ise hataane par vichaar kar rahi he
 To this, Minister of State for Home Affairs Kishan Reddy replied
 unhone kaha ki-artical 370 ek asthai vyavastha he, jiskaa bhartiya samvidhan main asthaayee, sankramanakalin or vishesh upabandh sambandhi bhaag 21 main ullekh he
 On the other hand, Article 35 one said that it was recorded in the Constitution by the President's order issued in 1954
 grih rajya mantri ne bataaya ki vishesh darje ke kaaran raashtrapati rajya sarkaar se paraamarsh ke baad aadesh jari karte hai
 However, the government did not give a clear answer to the removal and removal of Article 370
 bataa den ki isse pehle saansad asaduddin ovaisi or ajay kumaar ne jammu-kashmir main parisemen kii khabaron ko lekar sawaal kiya tha
 Asked whether the government was considering delimitation work in the state to end regional imbalances in Jammu and Kashmir
 iskaa bhi grih mantralay ne spasht jawaab nahin diya tha
 Home Minister g Kishan Reddy said instead of giving information about the government's stand that the state of Jammu and Kashmir was not included in the jurisdiction of the Delimitation Act, 2002, because the Constitution of India regarding delimitation of constituencies of state legislatures Article 170 of the Act has not been applied to Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir rajya main vidhansabha ke nirvachan kshetron kaa parisemen jammu-kashmir ke samvidhan kii dhara 47 or 141 ke tahat kiya jaataa he
 The Minister of State for Home had told that at present there are 37,33,111 voters in Jammu division and 40,10,971 voters in Kashmir division
 supreme court ne niskriy ichhamrityu kii anumati de di he
 It is also called passive euthanasia
 ab ve marij, jo kabhi naa thik ho paane vaali beemaari se peedit hai or ghor pidaa main jivan kaat rahe hai
 He has been allowed to end his life with honor
 lekin kya koi bhi ichhamrityu paa saktaa he? aaie jaanate hai pasive athwa niskriy ichhamrityu ke bare main sabakuch
 a five-judge constitutional bench headed by Chief Justice of India Deepak Mishra in the Supreme Court has allowed 'passive euthanasia' and 'living will' with certain conditions
 court ne apni tippanee main kaha ki maranasann vyakti ko yah adhikaar hoga ki kab vah aakhri saans le
 The court said that people have every right to die out of respect
 living vil' ek likhit dastavej hota he jisamen koi marij pehle se yah nirdesh detaa he ki maranasann sthiti main pahunchane yaa rajamandi nahin de paane kii sthiti main pahunchane par use kis tarah kaa ilaaj diya jaae
 Passive euthanasia (euthanasia) is a condition when the life support support of a dead person is stopped or stopped
 haalanki 'living vil' arthath maut kii vasiyat par kuch logon ne ashanka jataai he ki iskaa durupyog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Supreme Court Comment 1 on euthanasia
 ek vayask vyakti jo kisi aisi beemaari se jujh rahaa he jo kabhi thik nahin ho sakati he
 Life is being cut in severe pain due to illness and there is no hope of recovery
 vah agar likhit main ichhamrityu kii maang kare to uske gharavaalon ko athwa doctor ko uskaa ilaaj roak dene yaa band karne kii anumati hogi
 In this, life support such as medication, dialysis and ventilation are allowed to be stopped or stopped
 2
 For 'living will' a person suffering from such incurable and painful disease will have to file an euthanasia before a medical panel
 'living vil' par panel ke log pehle puri jaankaree lenge or phir peedit ke ghar waalon se raay lenge
 After this, the victim will be kept in a 'cooling period' for some time
 jiske baad hi arji court tak pahonchegi
 What is the difference between passive and active euthanasia? a person suffering from an incurable and painful disease will be given passive euthanasia
 iskaa matlab yah he ki peedit vyakti ke jeevanarakshak upayon (dawaai, dialasis or ventilation) ko band kar diya jayega athwa roak diya jayega
 The victim himself will die
 active ichhamrityu kaa arth hota he injection yaa kisi anya madhyam se peedit ko mrityu dena
 The Supreme Court has allowed passive euthanasia, not active
 kin rogon main ichhamrityu kii anumati ne supreme court ne di he?supreme court ne kisi aise vishesh rog kaa ullekh nahin kiya he
 If doctors feel that there is no hope for the victim to recover, then passive euthanasia can be given after consulting his family members
 agar rogi puri tarah sochane samajhane main sakasham he to bhi kya nirnay parivaar waalon kaa hi hoga?nahin
 In such a situation, the right to decide will be entirely the victim's
 niskriy ichhamrityu dardanaak hogi?yah puri tarah doctors kii jimmedaari hogi ki ve marij ke dard ko or naa badhane den

 "when someone says 'beauty', i picture the icons of beauty
 People like Audrey Hepburn or Smita Patil come to mind
 For me, it has a lot to do with personality
 There were a lot of pretty women in cinema around Audrey Hepburn’s time, but she stood out because she had a very interesting personality—which went beyond her looks
 She did so much for women, for animal rights, for children's education — it's always the personality that comes through and makes one seem beautiful

 kya he maamalaarope ke mutabik jharkhand nivasee rajesh singh naam ke yuvak ne bacchee ko phusalaakar uske saath dushkarm kiya
 The girl's condition deteriorated so much that she had to be hospitalized
 police ne aaropee rajesh ko giraftaar kar liya lekin isi maamle ko bahaanaa banaakar emenes or shivasena ke logon ne bavaal khadaa kar diya
 Those who came from outside in this affair were also beaten badly, who had no fault

 baccha chori kii afvaah fail jaati he to bheed ban jaati he
 Just spread the rumor about cow meat, a crowd will form
 har bheed kaa agar postmortem karenge to dushman ek hi milegaa lekin alag-alag dushmano ko gadhane ke naam par bhi bheed ban jaati he
 Sometimes language and sometimes in the name of the state

 The situation became such that the Supreme Court had to issue directions as to what the police officers from the Daroga level to the DGP level would have to do

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have also talked to the Chief Minister of Gujarat about this

 ahmedabad-botad Bhaskar has written that 2000 people have left from Ahmedabad
 gujarat samachar ne likhaa he ki mehsana or patan se 1800 log gaye hai
 Now who among these has gone for Diwali and who is scared it is difficult to tell
 sankhya bhi ham apni taraf se nahin bataa rahe hai
 What happened in those eight ten days that caused such a large number of people to leave the state, was the violence so horrific
 aakhir hinsa failaane vaale logon kii baaten kitni bhi jaays hon, unki baat kitni bhi sahi ho, kya unhen is tarah se kanoon haath main lene diya ja saktaa he

 Such videos coming in social media need to be watched very carefully
 na to inhen dekhakar bahekaave main aana he or na hi bheed kaa hissaa bananaa he
 At first the police said that people are leaving the state due to festivals, but the workers who reached the other side told something else

 a girl was raped here on 28 September
 aaropee bihar kaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 The accused was immediately arrested by the police

 Congress leader Alpesh Thakor's name came up that he has a video message that has been said to incite violence, but so far no such thing has come out from the police records nor the police has registered any case against Alpesh Thakor
 
 alpesh kaa ek video zarur he jisamen ve shanti kii apil kar rahe hai or kah rahe hai ki hinsa ke bahaane unke samaaj ko badnaam kiya ja rahaa he
 But today the Gujarat Police has arrested a leader who has spoken violently in video messages
 is netaa ko congress kaa ek netaa bataakar giraftaar kiya gaya he jo taluka kaa chunaav jeet chukaa he
 Its name is Mahotji Thakor in a video threatening to leave migrant laborers

 Workers were targeted by attacking a cotton factory in Sabarkantha
 gujarat chembar of kamrs and idstry ke shailesh patawaari ne kaha he ki 70-80 pratishat mazdoor baahar ke hai, inke jane kaa asar kaam dhandhe par pad rahaa he

 Shailesh Patwari said that it should not have happened at the time of Diwali
 unhone kaha ki saat or aath aktubar ko selary bantati he
 The people of the industry are trying not to go out of the state after taking salary or else it will have a big impact on the business during Diwali
 gujarat chember of commers ke secretary kehete hai, 'isliye abhi kaa jo maahaul he dehshat kaa he
 But the government has taken good steps

 Have given assurances

 It will take a month to bring back those who have gone

 70-80 varkar gaiyr guzaraati hai
 Our artisans cannot do this work

 Therefore, removing the artisan would be very bad for the Gujarat industry

 They have less habit of labor in their blood
 dhandha kar legaa lekin bag kandhe par uthaakar nahin le jayega
 It has to be understood and will have to be accepted
 ' It should be noted that what Shailesh Patwari has said
 bihar upi ke mazaduron ke bina industry nahin chal sakati he
 The workers of these states have enriched many other states due to their cheap and excellent labor
 isliye jab kisi ne aparaadh kiya ho, to uske liye puure samudaay ko nishaanaa bananaa thik nahin
 Especially when the police have caught the rapist
 das din tak jo dehshat kaa maahaul rahaa, us par turant hi kaabo paa liya janaa chahie tha
 Now the guideline of the Supreme Court is that action has to be taken on every information before the crowd is formed and the crowd is not allowed to dominate
 supreme court ise test cese ke rup main le saktaa he ki gujarat main uske banaae model par kitna kaam hua he
 You are also appealed not to exaggerate the news coming from there

 a video has come from Mumbai
 jo bataa rahaa he ki bheed ban kar tut padane kaa copirite ab kisi ek ke paas nahin he
 In Thane, the people of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena called the media and started beating in front of the cameras instead of giving a person to the police station
 inke anusaar yah ek bacchee ke saath ashleel harakatein kar rahaa tha
 If caught, the law has enough rights to take action, it had to be handed over to the law, but this group of four people turned into court
 emenes ke zila adhyaksh ne turant isamen puure upi bihar kaa haath dekh liya or samaj liya
 Whether the crowd is formed only in Gujarat and Maharashtra, the reality is that it can be made anywhere
 bihar main hi bihar kii ladakiyon ke khilaaf ek bheed ban gai
 What will he do? use kis bhavukta se dekhen
 People from a village in Supaul district entered the girls' school with sticks and started beating them
 itnaa maaraa ki ladakiyon ko aspataal main bhartee karnaa pad gaya
 This school has 100 students
 skool kii chaatraon ke saath chhedhkhani aam ho gai thi
 There is also a school of students in front of the girls' school
 ladke apane skool kii diwaar par apshabd likh diya karte the jise lekar vivaad ho gaya
 The next day, the families of the boys and the villagers came and attacked the girls
 laathiyon, eenton or rods se buree tarah maaraa gaya
 Most of them are girls aged between 12 and 14 years
 hinsak bheed main mahilaayein bhi shaamil thim
 The police have named 9 people
 kuch logon kii giraftaar bhi ho chuki he
 Isn't it frightening that the village people cracked down on girls for opposing molestation
 unke liye yah manzar kitna khaufnak rahaa hoga
 Would not the crowd have been formed in Gujarat in the same way, would it not have been formed in Maharashtra
 tippaniyan a crowd makes news channels
 jab se channelon ko hindu muslim neshnal silebus thamaya gaya he ve bekaabu ho chale hai
 Whether a Muslim accused or a Muslim is involved in a case, just look at the storm on social media
 phir vahi aag channelon par barasati he
 a report by the Quint website showed the media a mirror
 1 aktubar ko dilli ke jahangirpuri ke ankit kumaar garg kii hatya hui thi
 Ankit was befriended by a Muslim girl
 alt news bataaya he ki kaise news channel or channelon ke website ne likhaa ki kya ankit garg ko hindu hone kii sazaa di gai
 Since another Ankit had been killed before this, some wrote how many Ankit would be killed
 jinhone jimmedaari se reporting kii unhone bhi dharm ke angel ko prashnvachak lagaakar chhod diya
 If you see this report of Arjun Siddharth of Alt News, you will be aghast that your media can do something to provoke religious sentiments
 aisi reporting se kab shahar jal jaae, koun us aag kii chapet main aa jaae pataa nahin
 It is now known that the killing of Ankit Garg was not honor killing
 ankit kii hatya ke maamle main akaash giraftaar hua he jise ankit or uski dost ke saath dosti pasand nahin thi
 Famous people started airing on social media as soon as Hindu Muslim angle came
 kya media santhaan apni website se ankit garg kii khabar dilit karenge, reporting kii sanstha itani dhwast ho gai he ki channel hon yaa akhbaar ab dilli se bhi dhang kii reporting nahin kar pate hai
 Referring to Ankit's sister's statement, there was an angle of religion, but the media put the headline in such a way that gave some more meaning to his statement
 ham sab par sawaal uthaaya he alt news ne
 This report of Alt News should be re-read in every newsroom or else the media which itself creates a crowd will question the crowd of Gujarat and Bihar
 kitne log rajya chhod kar gaye hai isaki koi nishchit sankhya nahin he
 Different media have different numbers
 ahmedabad mirar main ek uttar bhartiya sanghathan ke netaa ke hawaale se chapa he ki 50,000 log gujarat chhod kar chale gaye
 The Sandesh newspaper has written that 20,000 people have left
 ahmedabad-botad bhaskar ne likhaa he ki ahmedabad se 2000 log gaye hai
 Gujarat News has written that 1800 people have gone from Mehsana and Patan
 ab inamen se koun diwali ke liye gaya he or koun dehshat ke kaaran bataanaa mushkil he
 We are not even giving numbers on our behalf
 un aath das dinon main kya hua jiske kaaran itani badi sankhya main logon ko rajya chhodana padaa, kya hinsa itani bhayaavah thi
 After all, no matter how valid the words of the people who spread violence, no matter how correct they are, can they be allowed to take law in this way
 ahmedabad ke stesan or bas stop par rajya chhod kar jane vaale logon se media ab baat kar rahaa he to pataa chal rahaa he ki vahaan kya hua tha, ye log kyon dare hue hai
 On Sunday, the report of the Idian Express has written that people have left for Bihar UP after filling up buses from Ahmedabad
 tees-tees ghante kii yatra aasaan nahin hoti he
 The people who landed at the railway station from Darbhaga to Banaras have told their grief
 yahaan tak ki bihar upi se aae logon ke aadhaar card check kiye gayi hai ki ve bahari hai yaa nahin kyonki kuch log vahaan rahete rahete gujarati bolnaa sikh gaye the
 Many such videos also reached us in which people are talking about leaving the laborers in such houses and leaving them within 24 hours
 soshal media main aane vaale aise video ko bahut dhyaan se dekhne kii zarurat he
 Neither seeing them is misguided nor is it a part of the crowd
 pehle police ne kaha ki log tyoharon ke kaaran rajya chhod kar ja rahe hai magar duusari taraf pahunche mazaduron ne kuch or hi bataaya
 There is a village near the town of Himatnagar in Sabarkantha district of Gujarat
 28 sitambar ko yahaan ek bacchee ke saath balaatkaar hua
 The accused is said to be from Bihar
 police ne is aaropee ko turant giraftaar kar liya tha
 But the anger of the people hurt by the rape incident gradually increased against the migrant laborers
 unke saath marpet kii ghatnaayen bhi saamne ai hai
 Violence has occurred in Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad, Patan, Sabarkantha and Mehsana districts
 yahaan par halaat ab kaabo main hai
 All political parties have condemned the incident
 congress netaa alpesh thakor kaa naam aayaa tha ki unka koi video messej he jisamen hinsa ko bhadakaane kii baat kahi gai he magar abhi tak police ke record se aisi baat saamne nahin ai he or na hi police ne alpesh thakor ke khilaaf koi maamla darj kiya he
 There is a video of Alpesh in which he is appealing for peace, saying that his society is being maligned on the pretext of violence
 lekin gujarat police ne aaj ek aise netaa ko giraftaar kiya he jinhone video massej main hinsak baaten kii hai
 This leader has been arrested as a Congress leader who has won the taluka election
 iskaa naam mahotji thakor he jo ek video main pravasi mazaduron ko chhod kar chale jane kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 The victims of the attack have been those who work in the factory
 sabarkantha main ek coton factory par hamalaa kar mazaduron ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Shailesh Patwari of the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said that 70-80 percent of the workers are from outside, the impact of their going out of business
 naroda industry sangh ne kaha he ki mazaduron ko factory campus main hi rukne kaa intazaam kiya ja rahaa he
 In many places factory owners have met with the workers, they have been assured
 shailesh patawaari ne kaha ki diwali ke samay yah nahin hona chahie tha
 He said that on October 7 and 8, the salary is distributed
 industry ke log koshish kar rahe hai ki selary lene ke baad koi rajya se baahar nahin jaae varna diwali ke samay iskaa kaarobaar par bada asar padegaa
 The secretary of the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce says, "so the atmosphere that exists now is of panic
" lekin sarkaar ne achche kadam uthaae hai
 The police have meetings with the workers
 aashwaasan die hai
 i understand that trust is being built
 jo chale gaye unhen waapas laane main ek maheenaa lag jayega
 May be no more workers
 naroda main baahar ke varkar ke factory ke andar hi rahane kaa intazaam kar denge
 70-80 workers are non-living
 hamaare karigar log ye kaam nahin kar sakate hai
 No matter how much raw material we will have, but if there is no artisan then the factory is not going to run
 isliye karigar ko nikaalnaa gujarat ke industry ke liye bahut kharaab hoga
 Any party doing this is destroying the country
 inako maaf nahin karne vaala he
 Gujaratis should get an option but you know that people of Gujarat cannot do such labor
 unke blad main lebar karne kii aadat kam he
 Will do business but will not carry the bag on his shoulder
 yah samajhnaa padegaa or maananaa bhi padegaa
 ' shailesh patawaari ne jo baat kahi he us par gaur karnaa chahie
 Industry cannot run without the workers of Bihar UP
 in rajyon ke mazaduron ne apane saste or umdaa shram kii badaulat kai duusare rajyon ko samrudh kiya he
 Therefore, when someone has committed a crime, it is not right for him to target the whole community
 khaskar tab jab police ne balaatkaari ko pakad liya he
 The panic that lasted for ten days should have been overcome immediately
 ab to supreme court kii guideline he ki bheed banane se pehle uski har soochna par ection lenaa he or bheed ko haaavee nahin hone dena he
 The Supreme Court can take it as a test case of how much work has been done on its model in Gujarat
 aapse bhi apil he ki vahaan se aa rahi khabaron ko zyaada badha chadha kar pesh na karen
 It is in everyone's good that mutual trust is built and people return to work
 ek video aayaa he jo mumbai kaa he
 Which is telling that no one has the copyright to break up as a mob
 thane main maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke logon ne ek shaks ko thane main dene ke bajaae media ko bulaayaa or camaron ke saamne maarna shuru kar diya
 According to him, he was doing obscene acts with a child
 agar pakadaa gaya to kanoon ke paas paryaapt adhikaar hai ection lene ke, kanoon ke hawaale kar dena tha magar chaar logon kii yah toli court main badal gai
 The district president of MNS immediately saw and understood the entire UP Bihar's hand in it
 kya bheed sirf gujarat or maharashtra main banati he, hakeekat yah he ki wo kahin bhi ban sakati he
 In Bihar itself, there was a mob against the girls of Bihar
 uskaa kya karenge
 Look at him emotionally
 supaul zile ke ek gaanv ke log hi ladakiyon ke skool main lathi lekar ghus gaye or unhen maarane peetane lage
 Hit so much that the girls had to be hospitalized
 is skool main 100 chatraayen padhati hai
 It was common to seduce schoolgirls
 chaatraon ke skool ke saamne chaatro kaa bhi ek skool he
 The boys used to write abuses on the wall of their school, which got disputed
 jiske agle din ladakon ke parivaar or gaanv vaale aae or ladakiyon par tut pade
 He was badly hit by sticks, bricks and rods
 inamen se zyaadaatar 12 se 14 saal kii chatraayen hai
 Women were also included in the violent mob
 police ne 9 logon ko namjad kiya he
 Some people have also been arrested
 kya yah bhayaavah nahin he ki chhedhkhani kaa virodh karne par gaanv ke log hi ladakiyon par tut pade
 How frightening it must have been for them
 kya isi tarah se bheed gujarat main nahin ban gai hogi, kya isi tarah kii bheed maharashtra main nahin ban gai hogi
 The comments ek bheed news channel vaale banaate hai
 Ever since the channels have been handed over to the Hindu Muslim National Syllabus, they have become uncontrollable
 kisi maamle main muslim aaropee ho yaa musalmaan shaamil ho bas dekhie soshal media par kaisaa tufaan machataa he
 Then the same fire rains on the channels
 quint bevesite kii ek report ne media ko aaina dikhaaya he
 On October 1, Ankit Kumar Garg of Jahangirpuri, Delhi was killed
 ankit kii ek muslim ladki se dosti thi
 Alt News has told how the news channels and website of the channels wrote whether Ankit Garg was punished for being a Hindu
 chunki iske pehle ek or ankit kii hatya ho chuki thi to kuch ne likhaa ki kitne ankit maare jaaenge
 Those who reported responsibly also left the religion angle questioning them
 alt news ke arjuna siddharth kii is report ko dekhenge to aap saham jaaenge ki aapkaa media dharmik bhavanaaen bhadakaane ke liye kya kuch kar saktaa he
 When such reporting burns the city, who does not get caught in the fire
 ab jaakar pataa chalaa he ki ankit garg kii hatya honor keeling nahin thi
 Akash is arrested in the case of Ankit's murder, who did not like friendship with Ankit and his friend
 hindu muslim angel aate hi soshal media par jane pahachaane log hawa dene lage the
 Will the media institutes delete the news of Ankit Garg from their website, the reporting institution has collapsed so much that the channels or newspapers are no longer able to report even in Delhi
 ankit kii bahan ke bayaan ke hawaale se dharm kaa angel aayaa tha magar media ne hedline aise lagaai jo unke bayaan ko kuch or matlab detaa tha
 Alt News has questioned all of us
 alt news kii is report ko har news room main phir se padhaa janaa chahie varna jo media khud bheed banaata ho vah gujarat or bihar kii bheed par kaise sawaal uthayega
 What happened in those eight ten days that caused such a large number of people to leave the state, was the violence so horrific
 aakhir hinsa failaane vaale logon kii baaten kitni bhi jaays hon, unki baat kitni bhi sahi ho, kya unhen is tarah se kanoon haath main lene diya ja saktaa he
 The media is now talking to people leaving the state at Ahmedabad's station and bus stop, then it is being known that what happened there, why are these people scared

 Many such videos also reached us in which people are talking about leaving the laborers in such houses and leaving them within 24 hours

 Neither seeing them is misguided nor is it a part of the crowd

 There is a village near the town of Himatnagar in Sabarkantha district of Gujarat

 The accused is said to be from Bihar

 The victims of the attack have been those who work in the factory

 No matter how much raw material we will have, but if there is no artisan then the factory is not going to run

 Alt News has questioned all of us
 alt news kii is report ko har news room main phir se padhaa janaa chahie varna jo media khud bheed banaata ho vah gujarat or bihar kii bheed par kaise sawaal uthayega
 It should be noted that what Shailesh Patwari has said
 bihar upi ke mazaduron ke bina industry nahin chal sakati he
 The workers of these states have enriched many other states due to their cheap and excellent labor
 isliye jab kisi ne aparaadh kiya ho, to uske liye puure samudaay ko nishaanaa bananaa thik nahin
 Especially when the police have caught the rapist
 das din tak jo dehshat kaa maahaul rahaa, us par turant hi kaabo paa liya janaa chahie tha
 Now the guideline of the Supreme Court is that action has to be taken on every information before the crowd is formed and the crowd is not allowed to dominate

 In Thane, the people of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena called the media and started beating in front of the cameras instead of giving a person to the police station

 Whether the crowd is formed only in Gujarat and Maharashtra, the reality is that it can be made anywhere
 bihar main hi bihar kii ladakiyon ke khilaaf ek bheed ban gai
 What will he do? use kis bhavukta se dekhen
 People from a village in Supaul district entered the girls' school with sticks and started beating them
 itnaa maaraa ki ladakiyon ko aspataal main bhartee karnaa pad gaya
 This school has 100 students
 skool kii chaatraon ke saath chhedhkhani aam ho gai thi
 There is also a school of students in front of the girls' school
 ladke apane skool kii diwaar par apshabd likh diya karte the jise lekar vivaad ho gaya
 The next day, the families of the boys and the villagers came and attacked the girls
 laathiyon, eenton or rods se buree tarah maaraa gaya
 Most of them are girls aged between 12 and 14 years
 hinsak bheed main mahilaayein bhi shaamil thim
 The police have named 9 people
 kuch logon kii giraftaar bhi ho chuki he
 Isn't it frightening that the village people cracked down on girls for opposing molestation
 unke liye yah manzar kitna khaufnak rahaa hoga
 Would not the crowd have been formed in Gujarat in the same way, would it not have been formed in Maharashtra
 tippaniyan a crowd makes news channels
 jab se channelon ko hindu muslim neshnal silebus thamaya gaya he ve bekaabu ho chale hai
 Whether a Muslim accused or a Muslim is involved in a case, just look at the storm on social media
 phir vahi aag channelon par barasati he
 a report by the Quint website showed the media a mirror
 1 aktubar ko dilli ke jahangirpuri ke ankit kumaar garg kii hatya hui thi
 Ankit was befriended by a Muslim girl
 alt news bataaya he ki kaise news channel or channelon ke website ne likhaa ki kya ankit garg ko hindu hone kii sazaa di gai
 Since another Ankit had been killed before this, some wrote how many Ankit would be killed
 jinhone jimmedaari se reporting kii unhone bhi dharm ke angel ko prashnvachak lagaakar chhod diya
 If you see this report of Arjun Siddharth of Alt News, you will be aghast that your media can do something to provoke religious sentiments
 aisi reporting se kab shahar jal jaae, koun us aag kii chapet main aa jaae pataa nahin
 It is now known that the killing of Ankit Garg was not honor killing
 ankit kii hatya ke maamle main akaash giraftaar hua he jise ankit or uski dost ke saath dosti pasand nahin thi
 Famous people started airing on social media as soon as Hindu Muslim angle came
 kya media santhaan apni website se ankit garg kii khabar dilit karenge, reporting kii sanstha itani dhwast ho gai he ki channel hon yaa akhbaar ab dilli se bhi dhang kii reporting nahin kar pate hai
 Referring to Ankit's sister's statement, there was an angle of religion, but the media put the headline in such a way that gave some more meaning to his statement
 ham sab par sawaal uthaaya he alt news ne
 This report of Alt News should be re-read in every newsroom or else the media which itself creates a crowd will question the crowd of Gujarat and Bihar
 das din tak jo dehshat kaa maahaul rahaa, us par turant hi kaabo paa liya janaa chahie tha
 Now the guideline of the Supreme Court is that action has to be taken on every information before the crowd is formed and the crowd is not allowed to dominate
 supreme court ise test cese ke rup main le saktaa he ki gujarat main uske banaae model par kitna kaam hua he
 You are also appealed not to exaggerate the news coming from there
 sabaki bhalaai isi main he ki aapasi vishwaas bane or log kaam par lauten
 a video has come from Mumbai
 jo bataa rahaa he ki bheed ban kar tut padane kaa copirite ab kisi ek ke paas nahin he
 In Thane, the people of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena called the media and started beating in front of the cameras instead of giving a person to the police station

 If caught, the law has enough rights to take action, it had to be handed over to the law, but this group of four people turned into court
 emenes ke zila adhyaksh ne turant isamen puure upi bihar kaa haath dekh liya or samaj liya
 Whether the crowd is formed only in Gujarat and Maharashtra, the reality is that it can be made anywhere
 bihar main hi bihar kii ladakiyon ke khilaaf ek bheed ban gai
 What will he do?
