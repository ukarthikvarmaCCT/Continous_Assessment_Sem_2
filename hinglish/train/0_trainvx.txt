 iskaa jawaab jediu netaa ke si tyaagi ne diya or kaha ki nitish kumaar kii apni image he or bhrashtachar ke saath koi samjhauta nahin kiya jayega
 He described the statement of the RJD MLA as arrogant
 kya he bihar vidhansabha main dalgat sameekaranbihar ke satta samikarnpar najar daalen, to 243 sadasyeey vidhansabha main argedy 80 siton ke saath sabase badi party he
 JDU has 71 seats
 to bijepi ke khate main 58 siten hai
 The Congress has 27 seats
 siton ke maamle main duusare number par rahane ke baavjood nitish kumaar bihar ke siem bane
 In such a situation, even if Nitish joins hands with BJP, if RJD breaks ties, he will remain in power after crossing the majority mark with 129 seats (71 + 58)
 haalanki, lalu bijepi ko ye mauka nahin dena chahenge or baahar se samarthan jari rakhenge

 ) Sometimes a disaster can come as a relief for someone
 aisa hi kuch maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantriyon vilaas raav deshmukh or susheel kumaar scindia ke maamle main bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 During their tenure between 1999 and 2004, both former chief ministers were surrounded by uncomfortable questions about the allocation of 27 influential persons to plots owned by the Maharashtra Housing and Redevelopment Authority (MHADA)
 emdie kii ek gopneey report main unhen bhoomi aavantit karte samay niyamon ke ulanghan ke liye doshi bataaya gaya tha
 But now it seems that the June 21 fire in the axis of power in the state has brought some relief for them
 mana ja rahaa he ki deshmukh or scindia ko pareshaani main daal dene vaali gopneey report aag kii bhent chadh chuki he
 There are also reports that files related to Pune's land scam, which came to light after the repeal of the Urban Land Ceiling Act in 2007, have also been destroyed in the fire
 yah ghotaalaa bhi 1995 se 2004 ke dauraan ke bhoomi aavantnon se hi sambandhit tha
 Lakhs of square meters of land were allegedly freed from government occupation on the basis of fake government orders and were essentially put to personal use instead of being used for housing the poor
 2010 main bombai hycourt ne is ghotaale kii jaanch kar rahi special investigeshan team (esaity) se tatkaaleen shahari vikaas rajyamantri bhaajapa ke raaj purohit ko is maamle main aaropee ke rup main namjad karne ke liye kaha tha
 Former Chief Minister Deshmukh is also accused of rescuing the officials responsible for the scam
 deshmukh aaropon kaa khandan karte hue kehete hai, ''bhrasht adhikariyon ke khilaaf sabase pehle karrwai karne vaala main hi tha or maine rajasav kii vasuuli ke aadesh die the
 229 crores to the state only because of my action
 kaa rajasav mila tha
 Documents related to the policy decisions on the proposed Churchgate Virar elevated rail corridor, the proposed Navi Mumbai airport and actions taken on tainted officials have also been destroyed

 One of the servers of the Department of Information Technology on the fourth floor is believed to have caught fire around 2:40 pm due to a short circuit and speeding up the fifth, sixth and seventh due to sea breeze and inadequate measures to control it
 Spread on the floors too

 The advertisement appealed to people to contact the state government with copies of documents submitted
 chavaan ne yah spasht karne main der nahin kii ki unki sarkaar computaron kii jal chuki hard discon se data hasil karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 The details of each file in the hard disks and their activity in the relevant departments were recorded
 aag lagane ke samay mantralay main 2,000 computer the
 1,500 of them have been destroyed
 mukhyamantri chavaan ne aag lagane ke kuch ghanton ke baad ek press conference main kaha, ''ham 2
 3 of 27 lakh files
 18 karod dastavejon ko pehle hi scan kar chuke hai
 The data is kept secure on various servers outside the ministry
 mujhe yakeen he ki hamaare ejeeniyar hard discon se data nikaal paane main kaamyaab ho jaaenge
 However, BJP MLA Devendra Fadnavis of Nagpur does not believe this
 unka kahana he, ''hard discon kaa data to 50 degree celsius ke taapmaana ko hi nahin jhel saktaa
 The temperature had risen to over 400 degrees Celsius due to the fire
 hard discon se data phir se hasil karnaa naammumkin he
 Chavan is claiming that the Adarsh scam files are completely safe
 unke daawey kaa samarthan ghotaale kii jaanch kar rahi sibiai ne bhi kiya or ghoshnaa kii ki in filon kii pratiyaan uske paas surakshit hai
 The government's hopes of recovering lost data are also alive due to the lengthy process of allowing files
 prakriya ke anusaar, har pariyojna or niti kii prayek file ko pehle vitt vibhaag ke paas uske anumodan ke liye janaa padataa he
 Once the project is approved by the Finance Department, the file goes to its parent department and then to the Chief Minister for final approval
 teesri manzil par sthit vitt vibhaag aag se batch gaya he
 According to sources, Finance Department Principal Secretary Sudhir Srivastava has assured Chavan and Pawar that about 90 percent of the data in their department's files can be retrieved
 rajasav mantri balasahab thoraat kaa kahana he ki unka vibhaag jila or nagar nigam str ke karyaalayon se aasaani se data praapt kar saktaa he
 "usually my department gets data from the district level," says Thorat
 main colectoron or rajasav ayuktaon se apane prastaav or suzav phir se bhejne ke liye kah saktaa hum
 "the office of Minister of State for Urban Development Sachin Ahir is also completely drenched in extinguishing the fire
 unka anumaan he ki aag ke asar ko 9 july se shuru ho rahe rajya vidhansabha ke monasutra satr ke dauraan bhi mahasoos kiya jayega, ''mere daftar main vidhansabha sadasyon dwaara uthaae gaye tarankit prashnon se sambandhit sabhi filein nasht ho gai hai
 It will take a long time to collect all the information once again
 ''mantralay main lagi is aag ke turant baad hi ek chutkula ekadam se lokapriy hua, jo kuch is tarah thah prithviraj chavaan kaagaj rahit prashasan chaahate the
 Literally there is no paper in the ministry
 agar chavaan kii sarkaar khoyaa hua data hasil kar paane main naakaam rahati he to unhen is tarah ke or bhi shabdabaanon kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 The exercise of major change has begun in the Modi cabinet
 kendriya mantri rajeev pratap rudi ne mantrimandal se istipha de diya he
 On the other hand, Uma Bharti has also offered to resign due to health reasons
 naakaam mantriyon par gaajakaushal vikaas mantri rajeev pratap rudi or health and family welfare rajya mantri faggan singh kulaste kaa istipha ho chukaa he, jabaki uma bharti, sanjeev baalyan, calraj mishra, mahendra nath pandeya istife dene kii qatari main hai, yani inhone istife kii peshkash kar di he, or puri sambhaavna he ki inkaa bhi istipha manjuur kar liya jayega
 Actually, three years of Modi government have been completed
 piem modi ab un mantriyon ko or vakt katai dena nahin chaahate, jinka pradarshan ummid ke mutabik ab tak nahin rahaa he
 PM Modi had high expectations, especially from the ministry of Rudy and Uma Bharti
 lekin teen saal baad bhi in donon ke paas koi sateek agenda nahin hai, isliye inaki kursi par to maheenon se talwaar lataki thim
 Apart from this, there are signs of many failed ministers leaving from the cabinet
 inako mil sakati he badi jimmedaariis bich kendriya mantri prakaash jaavdekar, piyush goyal or dharmendra pradhan ko lekar acchhee khabar he
 If sources are to be believed, these three may increase in stature in the Modi cabinet
 philhal jaavdekar ke paas maanav sansaadhan mantralay, dharmendra pradhan ke paas petroleum mantralay or piyush goyal ke paas urja mantralay kaa jimmaa he
 According to the news, PM Modi is satisfied with the work of these three and they can get a big responsibility
 kaam ke boj tale dabe mantridarasal is vakt arun jetali vitt mantralay ke saath raksha mantralay bhi sambhaal rahe hai
 While doctors Harshvardhan and Smriti Irani also have two important ministries

 Significantly, the third cabinet reshuffle of the Modi government's tenure is going to happen on September 2

 The city of Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, which until now has been stained with the stigma of death of innocent people with brain fever
 wo gorakhpur in dinon bhavy mahotsav se gulzaar he
 CM Yogi Adityanath, who sits on the throne of UP power, comes from this Gorakhpur city
 3 din ke 'gorakhpur mahotsav' ke jashn main dubi hui yogi sarkaar par vipaksh sawaal khadey kar rahaa he
 The opposition said that the Yogi government has not remained sensitive
 uttar pradesh main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kaa shahar gorakhpur saj gaya he
 The 'gorakhpur Festival' pandal in the Gorakhpur University campus has been molded according to the choice of CM Yogi
 chaaron ore bhagava rang hi rang najar aa rahe hai
 The huge stage of Gorakhpur festival is decorated with saffron color from flowers to flowers
 bataa den ki gorakhpur mahotsav kaa ye doosraa saal he
 It was organized last year in opposition to the BJP, but the grandeur of the Gorakhpur festival was not such

 satta ke saaye main aaleeshaan tareeke se ayojit kiye ja rahe kaarykram ke bahaane vipaksh yogi sarkaar par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Instead of directly questioning the Gorakhpur festival, former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav mentioned such an incident, this month had shaken the entire nation

 Opposition allegations on Utsavo can be considered as a political politics, but sadly, the reality of Gorakhpur is not only in the state but in front of the whole country

 He said, "we will churn our defeat, we will see where we went wrong and i sincerely hope that it will happen again as it did in 1998-99, when we won the assembly elections and lost the Lok Sabha elections

 hardik patel ne kaha he ki 3 november ko surat main hone vaali congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kii jansabha kaa vah na hi samarthan karenge, na hi virodh
 Hardik Patel said that the legal opinion that the Congress has asked to wait on this issue is also ready to wait for it

 The BJP accused the Arvind Kejriwal government that Delhi is prone to poisonous water
 pani kii samasya dilli kii sabase badi samasya he
 At the same time, CM Arvind Kejriwal had said that he is not interested in doing politics on the issue of water and his aim is to provide clean water to the citizens
 unhone pani va siver conection ke liye devlepment shulk va infrastracchar shulk ko maaf karne ke dilli jal board (dijebi) ke faisle kii ghoshnaa kii
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been sitting on a dharna in the office of Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal since last Monday
 unke saath manish sisodiya or gopal raay bhi dharne par hai
 While Health Minister Satyendar Jain has been hospitalized due to sudden deterioration in his health
 pichley aath din se kejariwal or unke mantri sarkari kaamkaaj se dur LG ke daftar main jame hue hai
 By the way, Kejriwal has an old relationship with picketing
 lekin is baar kaa lekha-jokha nikaalen to pataa chalata he ki kejariwal ko is dharne se nuksaan kam, phayda zyada hota dikh rahaa he
 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal suddenly sat on a dharna in the office of Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal last Monday, amid clashes with IAS officers in the LG office
 unhone maang rakh di ki alji dilli ke IAS afasaron ko hadtaal waapas lene kaa aadesh den
 According to Kejriwal, the IAS officers' strike is affecting the functioning, and the decisions that are to be taken in the interest of the people of Delhi are being delayed
 unhone is mudde ko sidhe janata se jod diya
 Chief Minister of four states got support in the midst of deadlock with the Governor, in support of Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of four states came down
 ravivaar ko karnataka, pashchim bengal, kerala or andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantriyon ne piem modi se niti ayog kii baithak ke dauraan dilli maamle main hastkshep kii apil kii
 The Chief Minister of these four states extended his support to Kejriwal and said that what is happening in Delhi against an elected government is wrong
 9 partiyon kaa samarthantiemasi, jedies, jediu, tidipi, shivasena, argedy, bispi, sapa, areldi samet 9 partiyon ne kejariwal kii maang ko sahi bataaya
 All these parties said in unison that the Delhi government is being treated step-by-step
 in dalon ke netaaon ne iske liye sidhe modi sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 Support from these 9 parties further strengthened the aap's demands
 IAS adhikariyon ko aana padaa ageis gatirodh ke bich ravivaar ko jab iees afasaron ne pressvarta kar elaan kiya ki ve tab tak dilli sarkaar ke mantriyon kii routine baithkon main nahin jaaenge jab tak unhen suraksha kaa aashwaasan nahin miltaa he, isse saaf ho gaya ki adhikari dilli sarkaar kii routine baithkon main shaamil nahin ho rahe the
 Meanwhile, Kejriwal immediately released a video message saying that the officers are like his family members and they fully guarantee his safety
 ab agar afasar kathith hadtaal tod dete hai to ye kejariwal ke liye jeet kii tarah hoga
 Kejriwal appealed to the IAS officers once again to return to work after AAP leaders and activists marched from Mandi House to Sansad Marg on the streets in support of the evening
 vaise to party ne piem awaas ke gheraav ke liye dilli kii janata ko sadak par utarane kii apil kii thi
 The party wanted to see its strength through this, and the party was overwhelmed by the crowd on the streets
 sadakon par samarthakon ke jansailab dekh kejariwal ke hausale buland hai
 But amidst all this, Kejriwal has a strong connection with the dharna, his party has come out of the movement itself
 aise main unka achaanak dharne par baith jane se vipaksh ko baith-bithaae unpar hamale ke liye hathiyaar mil gaya, or AAP ko isse kuch nuksaan bhi ho saktaa he
 When the Kejriwal sat on a dharna in the office of the Lieutenant Governor with his ministers last Monday, he remembered the old image of the protesting party
 bijepi-congress ko bhi kehane kaa mauka mil gaya ki kejariwal ko bhi pataa he ki dilli kaa super bos koun hai, lekin wo dikhaave ke liye dharne par baith gaye hai
 The opposition alleged that this scorching heat of Delhi is troubled by water scarcity and pollution, and the Chief Minister is doing sit-in politics on the sofa in the AC room
 dilli main vikaas kaa kaam rukaabijepi or congress bhi kam se kam dilli main ye maahaul banane main juty hai ki kejariwal ke dharne se dilli kaa vikaas ruk gaya he or kaam thap pad gaye hai
 In such a situation, if the party continues this strike, it may be difficult for the public to respond
 ye bhi vajah he ki ab kejariwal ke saamne is dharne ko jald se jald khatm karne ke alaava vikalp nahin bachaa he
 This matter has now reached the High Court due to the High Court's comment, and the initial remarks of the Court cannot be said in support of Kejriwal
 uparajyapal ke daftar main dharne par tippanee karte hue hoicourt ne kaha he ki ham samaj nahin paa rahe hai ki ye dharna he yaa hadtaal or kya isaki koi anumati lee gai yaa khud hi tay kar liya gaya
 The court asked that if it was personally decided (by Kejriwal and ministers), then it should have been outside the LG office
 kya alji ke daftar ke andar ye dharna karne ke liye ijaajat lee gai he? hoicourt ne kaha ki aap kaise kisi ke ghar yaa daftar main jaakar hadtaal par baith sakate hai

 In the wake of the Lok Sabha elections 2019, there is a competition to lay the foundation stone from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the Chief Ministers of the state
 yahi vajah he ki ab shilanyas karne vaale netaaon kii fehrist main nitish kumaar bhi shaamil hone vaale hai
 a few months ago, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who claimed not to believe in the culture of Shilanyas and started a new beginning of work in Bihar, has also gone on the path of 'lay the foundation' like Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 darasal, loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle mangalvaar or vuudhvaar ko mukhyamantri nitish kumaar patna or nalanda jile main ek saath kareeb ek sau yojanaon kaa shilanyas karenge, jisamen bijli vibhaag, sinchai kii pariyojna, jal aapurti, dental college kaa shilanyas aadi shaamil hai
 There are many of these projects, which the cabinet approved on Monday evening
 abhi tak cabinet se manjuuri ke baad nitish kumaar tender hone ke baad bihar main kisi pariyojna kaa karyaarambh kiya karte the
 But now it is believed that just before the Lok Sabha elections, just as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is taking part in the foundation stone program after another, now Nitish Kumar feels that if the election is on the head, then why wait for the commencement Go pichley dinon pradhanmantri narendra modi ne patna metro kaa shilanyas kendriya cabinet se manzuri milane ke mahaj chaar dinon andar kiya tha
 Apart from this, PM Modi laid the foundation stone of construction work of many hospitals of the state, for which no one knows anything yet
 haalanki, nitish kumaar dwaara hone vaale adhikansh shilanyas or udghaatan ke kaarykram yaa to munger loksabhaa seat se sambandhit hai yaa nalanda loksabhaa seat se
 Experts believe that if Nitish is understood by his principles and is following the old model of the Congress on the foundation of the foundation, then there are reasons
 jahaan munger se ab nitish kumaar ke kareebi jal sansaadhan mantri lalan singh kii ummidavaari tay maani ja rahi he or vahaan ke matadaataaon kii puraani maangon ko maanate hue sabhi yojanaon ko aanan-fanan main shuru kiya ja rahaa hai
 At the same time, Nitish Kumar won the Nalanda seat in the last Lok Sabha election with a margin of small votes, but now he will try to cash in on it
 jeet ke antar ko bada karne ke liye is baar nitish kumaar ko kasar nahin chhodana chaahate hai
 Nitish Kumar may also perform Tabatodar Shilanyas in other districts

 It is 2017
 rohit ne ek metromonial site par apurva shukla kaa profile dekha
 Rohit also told his mother Ujjwala about this
 phir rohit ne apurva se milane kaa faisla kiya
 The two first met in Lucknow city
 dekhte hi apurva rohit ke man ko bha gai
 In a few days both of them had become close
 or phir donon liv -in main saath rahane lage
 Both were living together for almost a year
 lihaaja 12 may 2018 ko rohit or apurva shaadi ke bandhan main bandha gaye
 The wedding ceremony was held at a five star hotel in Delhi
 jisamen desh ke kai bade netaa or adhikari or jane-maane log shaamil hue the
 Rohit's mother Ujjwala was very happy after marriage
 shaadi ke baad apurva apane pati rohit ke saath dilli kii dephence colony main unke ghar rahane aa gai
 Both of their families were frozen, but only a few days later Apoorva came to know about a woman
 jo rohit ke kisi rishtedaar kii patni thi
 The woman was considered close to Rohit
 bas yaheen se is kahani main 'wo' kii entry hui
 It was not even a few months after the marriage that the rivalry started growing between the two
 apurva ke man main rohit kii jo chhavi bani hui thi, wo dhoomil ho rahi thi
 Whereas, Rohit was becoming closer to the woman
 rohit aksar us mahila se milane jaataa tha
 Apoorva did not accept this
 donon ke bich vivaad hone laga tha
 On this day, there used to be an argument between Rohit and Apoorva about this matter
 jaankaree main aayaa ki apurva aksar rohit se apane gharavaalon ke liye ek ghar kii maang karti thi
 But nobody responded to this
 maamla ab ujjwala tak pahunch chukaa tha
 Seeing the matter getting worse, the matter reached the divorce
 charchaa hone ke baad yah tay hua ki is par baatcheet june maah main hogi
 After a quarrel and quarrel, Apoorva went to her maternal home in Indore on 3 March
 vahaan wo 29 march tak rahi
 After this, Apoorva came back to Rohit in Defense Colony on 30 March
 11 april ko uttarakhand main loksabhaa chunaav tha
 Rohit and Ujjwala were to go there to cast their vote
 jab rohit vahaan gaya to wo apni us mahila mitra ko bhi saath le gaya tha, jisaki vajah se apurva naaraaz thi
 Meanwhile, an incident occurred
 jisane rohit or apurva ke bich or daraar paidaa kar di
 It happened that when Rohit was in Kathgodam, Uttarakhand
 usee bich apurva ne rohit ke mobile phone par video kol kii
 In which Apoorva was seen that woman
 jo us vakt rohit ke saath sharaab pi rahi thi
 Some sources believe that Rohit was in an objectionable position with the woman at the time
 rohit ne mahila ko chupaane kii koshish to kii lekin apurva ne us mahila ko dekh liya tha
 Apoorva was heartbroken after this incident
 uskaa gussa saatven aasmaan par tha
 Rohit also came to know about Apurva's story
 apurva bahut niraash or udhaas thi
 It is also said that when that woman was pregnant, Apoorva suspected that Rohit's child was in his womb
 haalanki police ne apni tafteesh main is baat ko puri tarah se nakaar diya
 On April 15, Rohit returned with his mother and brother to his home in Delhi
 us raat rohit ke dephence colony vaale ghar main rohit kii patni apurva, bada bhai siddharth sharma, naukaraani martha, naukar golu or driver akhilesh maujuud the
 Rohit's mother had dinner that night and returned to her government residence in Tilak Lane Delhi
 ujjwala ke mutabik us raat rohit thik-thaak tha
 Just seemed a little drunk
 us kaali raat rohit khaanaa khaane ke baad apane kamare main ja chukaa tha
 It was around one o'clock in the night
 apurva rohit ke kamare main pahunchi
 He wakes up Rohit and starts asking about the woman
 donon ke rishte main daraar to pehle se hi thi
 The matter had come to the point of divorce
 lekin jo tis apurva ke dil main uth rahi thi
 She had become a wound
 isi baat ko lekar donon ke bich jhagada hone laga
 The matter reached melee
 rohit nashe main dhut tha
 Angry Apurva overshadowed her
 naa chaahate hue bhi usne rohit kaa munh or galaa takie se dabaakar use maut ke ghat utaar diya
 Rohit's body was cold
 uske sharir ne harakat karnaa band kar diya tha
 The beating of the heart had stopped
 uski saanson ne uskaa saath chhod diya tha
 Now Rohit's body was lying on his bed in the form of a corpse
 apurva vahiin bistar par baith gai
 His breath was fast
 dil kii dhadkan kisi railgadee kii tarah daud rahi thi
 She knew that Rohit would never wake up now
 sab khatm ho chukaa tha
 Every Shikwa Gila went with Rohit's life
 apurva ke dil main jo tufaan tha, wo tham chukaa tha
 Her infidelity and ignorance of her husband shook Apoorva so much that she made her honeymoon desolate with her own hands
 isliye kehete hai ki ek aurat sabakuch bardaasht kar sakati he, lekin pati kii bevafaayee nahin

 - input IANS Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has started a new debate in the political corridors by making a new statement on reservation
 maanjhi ne kaha ki agar sahi shiksha di jaae, to daliton ko aarakshan kii jarurat nahin he
 Along with this, Manjhi also said that if the Dalits are conscious in Bihar, then the next Chief Minister will also be from the Dalit community
 maanjhi ne kaha, 'maine 1982 main hi kaha tha ki daliton ko shiksha or rojgaar dene kii zarurat he, unhen aarakshan kii zarurat nahin he
 If they get education, the children of Dalits will be left behind
 'duusari ore bijepi ke ramkripal yadav ne maanjhi kaa paksh lete huenithish kumarper nishaanaa saadhaa
 Yadav said, 'nitish Kumar has given his leaders complete leeway to plead Manjhi
 unki hi party ke netaa apane mukhyamantri kaa apmaan kar rahe hai
 ' holliwood mohini megan faks nahin chaahatin ki angelina joli se unki tulana kii jaae kyonki vah joli kii tarah ‘gambhir or udasin’ nahin hai
 The New York Times reports that the 'transformer' star has been consistently compared to Jolie, but Fox insists the two are completely different
 faks ne kaha kilog meri tulana joli se karte hai
 He is very serious and indifferent

 i am not an actress like Angelina

 com / rviaac2tz0 The cross-examination continued for the third day on Friday through video conferencing from terrorist David Coleman Headley, one of the conspirators of the 26 / 11 attacks in Mumbai
 hedli ne khulaasa bataaya ki uske pita kii maut ke kuch hafton baad tatkaaleen pakistani pradhanmantri usoof raja gilaani uske ghar aae the
 According to Headley, when his father retired, he was the Director General of Radio Pakistan
 unka nidhan 25 disambar 2008 ko hua tha
 Headley said that his father, brother and some other families were involved in the Pakistan Establishment , but he could not reveal his name
 court ko hedli ne bataaya ki usne khud apane pita se lashkar ke saath apne sambandhon kii charchaa kii thi
 He said, 'I myself told my father that i was associated with Lashkar
 unhone is par aapatti jataai thi
 The terrorist said that he was never questioned about the 9 / 11 attack
 usne kaha ki pakistan main use ek baar giraftaar kiya gaya tha, kyonki uski purv patni faija ne uske khilaaf cese darj karavaaya tha
 Ishrat's name not taken at the behest of the NIA
 David Headley has denied the allegations, stating that during interrogation, at the behest of the NIA, he named Ishrat Jahan and called him a Lashkar terrorist
 hedli ne kaha, 'enie ne mujhe ishrat kaa naam lene kii salaah nahin di
 He questioned me, which i answered
 wo bhala mujhe ishrat kaa naam lene ke liye kyon kahenge? maine tahawwur rana ke america main trial ke dauraan ishrat kaa naam isliye nahin liya kyonki unhone mujhase is bare main sawaal nahin kiya
 i would only say what i was asked
 ''bharat ne tabah kiya tha meraa skool'hedli ne khulaasa kiya he ki vah bharat se badla lenaa chahta tha, kyonki bhartiya vimaanon ne 1971 main uske skool par bam barasaaye the
 pakistani-american terrorist said in a court in Mumbai on Friday, "I wanted to take revenge on India
" 07 disambar 1971 ko bhartiya vimaanon ne bambaari kar mere skool ko tabah kar diya tha
 Many people working there were killed in that accident
 ' hedli ne kaha ki kai saare kaarnon main se ek kaaran yah bhi rahaa ki usne lashkar-e-taiyaba jwoin kiya
 'I did not add conditions to the petition' Headley told the court that he had not added the conditions like refusal of extradition to India or Pakistan
 aatanki ne kaha, 'is orefabiai or vakilonki meeting ke dauraan main shaamil nahin rahaa hum
 i did not add the conditions in the petition that i will not extradite India or Pakistan or i should not be hanged
 ' usne court se aage kaha, 'maine sochaa ki main yahaan sarkaar kii ore se gavaahi dene ke liye laayaa gaya hum
 "I am a very bad man" Headley said on the third day of the cross-examination that he confesses all his crimes
 usne kaha, 'main bahut kharaab insaan hum
 i agree to this
 main aparaadh sweekaar kar chukaa hum
 If you are saying then i agree
 'court ko hedli ne bataaya ki use rahane ke liye jail main koi lagjri suvidha nahin di gai
 He laughed and responded to the question of such a suggestion during the cross-examination
 vakil vahab khan se usase poocha ki kya jail main use vaivaahik adhikaar diya gaya? lekin jaj jike sanap or special public prosicuter ujjwal nikam ne is tarah ke sawaal karne par aapatti jataai
 Lashkar had tried to assassinate Bal Thackeray, earlier on Thursday during the cross-examination, Headley had said that let had unsuccessfully tried to kill Shiv Thackeray founder Bal Thackeray
 usne yah bhi kabool kiya usne is babat do baar shivasena bhawan kii reki kii thi

 aatmahatya duniya bhar main ek badi samasya ke taur par ubhar rahaa he
 There have been continuous reports of suicides on social media via live video
 haal hi main netflix ke ek siries ko lekar kaaphi hangaamaa hua jo suicide par aadhaarit tha
 Its release was also banned
 internet or eps ke is daur main ab ek suicide karne vaala game saamne aa rahaa he jisane mumbai ke varshiya manpreet ko apana shikaar bana liya
 The 14-year-old student allegedly jumped from the 5th floor playing the game
 ab police ne is game ko lekar adwijuri jari kar di he
 Not only India, but Neulia, a 15-year-old student from Britain and Veronicane, a 16-year-old student, also jumped from the roof of the apartment and gave their lives
 kya he ye game or kyon ye logon ko suicide karne ke liye prerit kar rahaa he
 After this incident, the police there have started to identify the parents of the children
 darasal yah soshal media se hi aayaa he
 It is being told that there is a group which is inciting people to commit suicide
 yah group soshal media par zyada active rahata he
 Posts related to this are also becoming increasingly viral on Instagram
 is group kaa group apane members ko rojaanaa task detaa he jise 50 din main puraa karnaa hota he
 These tasks are very dangerous and fatal
 inamen khud ko nuksaan pahunchaana, kisi aise samay ghoomana jo kaaphi ajeeb hai yaa horer filmein dekhne jaise task shaamil hai
 On completion of the 50th day of the task, the people behind this game ask the youth to suicide
 itnaa hi nahin unhen suicide karne ke tareekon ke bare main bhi bataaya jaataa he
 At the moment it is not clear where this group is being run or who are behind the game
 ye game kaise khelaa ja rahaa he iske bare main bhi jaankaree nahin he
 However, the veracity of this game has also not been confirmed
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki smartphone main apinstall karke yah khelaaja rahaa he, jabaki kuch kaa maananaa he ki ise soshal media jaise fasebuk or instagram par khelaa ja rahaa he
 Britain's child protection organization the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NPCC) has said that children should not follow the crowd and refrain from doing things that are painful for them
 bas teraa din auki auki swat main kaayam ho jaaegi taliban kii hukumat, lagu ho jayega sharia kaa kanoon
 The Taliban has fixed the date for the implementation of Sharia in the entire Malakand Division of Pakistan
 taarikh he 15 march auki kaisaa hoga sharia kaa shashan isaki baangi abhi se hi dikhni shuru ho gai he
 Taliban guns are no longer fired in Pakistan's Swat Valley
 goliyon kii zarurat bachi hi nahin he, kyonki pakistan kii sarkaar to ab talibani sargana mullah fazalullah or uske sasur sufi mohammad kii boli sunakar hi kaanp jaati he
 So Sufi Muhammad, the kingpin of tehreek-e-nifaz-e-sharia-e-muhammadi, ordered the entire Malakand division to start a Sharia court by 15 March, when the commissioner of Malakand came to him on his knees
 malakand divizan main sharia lagu hoga, lekin sharia adaalaton main jo qaazi tainaat honge, wo niyamit nyaayik adhikari hi honge
 The only difference will be that the judicial officers posted in the Malakand Division will be called Qazis, who will deliver judgments according to Sharia law
 jabaki ab malakand ke kamishnar saiyad mohammad javed swat jaakar sufi mohammad ko sharia adaalaton ke liye qaazi tainaat karne kii guhaar laga aae hai
 That is, Sharia courts will no longer have the Kazi of the choice of the Government of Pakistan, but the law of the will of Sufi Muhammad and Mullah Fazlullah, as was being done before the agreement
 iske alaava pakistan sarkaar ne sufi mohammad or mullah fazalullah kaa ek or farmaan maan liya he
 Till yesterday, the government of Pakistan, which was fighting the war as terrorists, is now roaming the same Taliban on the head in Swat
 mullah fazalullah kaa mingora ke paas jo madrasa band ho gaya tha, use islamic uniwarsity kaa darza dene kaa elaan bhi ho chukaa he
 Where Mullah Fazlullah would fearlessly train his disciples to panic
 swat ke log ab tak jin talibani aatankwaadiyon ke zulm se karaah rahe the, ab unki kismat kaa faisla unheen aatankwaadiyon ke haathon main saunpa ja chukaa he
 The danger is not only that the Taliban is becoming increasingly powerful, the trouble is also that the Pakistani intelligence agency and the army there are the Taliban's guard
 aise main khatra ek baar phir takhtapalat kaa he
 The picture of Pakistan presented by the Atlantic Council report led by US Senator John Kerry is truly frightening
 pakistan jabardast aarthik sankat se jujh rahaa he
 The situation is that the economy of Pakistan has become desirous of helping American and international banks
 atlantic kanusil kaa maananaa he ki pakistan ke halaat use ek baar phir takhtapalat kii taraf dhakel rahe hai or jaahir he agar aisa hua to ye america ke saath-saath bharat ke hiton ke bhi khilaaf hoga
 Swat is a hallmark, in fact, the Taliban's eyes are on the whole of Pakistan
 wo puure pakistan main sharia kaa kanoon lagu karnaa chaahate hai or kaayam karnaa chaahate hai aatank kaa raaj
 The alarming thing is that their steps are moving rapidly towards Islamabad
 aise main sawaal ye he ki kya bharat ko khatre kaa andaja he
 The forces of Taliban and Al Qaeda within Pakistan are constantly increasing
 afghanistan kii seemaa se sate kabaili ilaakon se nikal kar wo karachi auki islmabad par kabje ke liye taiyaar hai
 And the President of Pakistan himself has confessed many times that his country is fighting for his existence against Talibal
 swat main sharia lagu karne kii talibani maang ko maan kar pakistan ne apni kamajori ujagar kar di he
 The question is whether the Taliban's ambition is confined to Pakistan or will it take the interest of India after conquering Pakistan
 ham is baat ko nahin bhul sakate hai ki taliban kaa makasad sabhi sarhadon se pare ek aise raashtra kii sthapana kaa he jahaan sirf sharitay kaa raaj ho
 In such a situation, can India with a Muslim population larger than Pakistan remain outside the agenda of Taliban? jaahir he agar taliban pakistan main apni hukumat kaayam karne main kaamyaab ho jaataa he to uskaa alga nishaanaa bharat hi hoga
 He will give his full strength to mislead the Muslim population of India
 aatankwaad kaa jo jehar wo abhi chori-chupake bharat kii ragon main daal rahaa he talibani hukumat main dehshatgardi kaa ye khooni khel tab khuleam chalegaa auki tab islamabad main aisi sarkaar bhi nahin hogi jis par bharat yaa duniya ke dabaav kaa kisi tarah kaa asar ho kyonki tab vahaan hoga aatank kaa jangalraj
 But in Pakistan, the biggest threat from the Taliban or the Taliban regime is the nuclear weapons
 pakistan jaise kamjor mulk ke haath main mahavinaash kaa hathiyaar he or agar ye hathiyaar talibani hukumat ke haath lag gaye to iskaa anjaam kya hoga isaki kalpana karnaa bhi behad khaufnak he
 Because this danger will not be only for India but for the whole world
 sawaal ye he ki kya bharat or duniya ke baaki taqatvar mulk kya is khatre ko lekar sanjeeda hai? taliban kii badhati takat se khatra sirf hindustan ko hi nahin he
 America is also worried about how to destroy the ready base of terror in Pakistan
 asal main america is baat ko ab acchhee tarah samaj chukaa he ki aatank kii ladaai kaa asli morcha afghanistan main nahin pakistan main he
 American drone attacks on Pakistan are continuing and these attacks will continue as the areas of Pakistan adjoining Afghanistan have turned into the biggest hideout for terrorists
 america ab is baat ko acchhee tarah samaj chukaa he ki afghanistan main taliban or alqaida ke khilaaf jang nirnaayak tareeke se tab tak nahin jiti ja sakati jabatak ki dehshatgardon ko pakistan kii taraf se shah milti rahegi or yahi vajah he ki america ab har manch par is baat ko doharaana nahin bhuulataa ki taliban se ladaai main asli khatra kahaan se he
 US Defense Minister Robert Gates, in an interview to a private television channel, said in clear words that to date Pakistan has turned into a safe haven for not only al Qaeda and Taliban but also all the major terrorist organizations of the world and for America This is the biggest danger
 gates ne kaha ki pakistan main panaah liye sabhi dehshatgard sanghathanon ke naam bhale hi alag-alag hai lekin wo karrwai hameshaa ekasaath milakar karte hai
 India has been reiterating for a long time what America is admitting today that America's declared enemies Taliban and Al Qaeda and India's enemies Lashkar and Jaish may appear to be different organizations but the reality is that all are on the same plate There are rocks
 america raksha mantri robert gates 20 saal pehle siie ke joint diarector ke taur par khud afghanistan or pakistan main tainaat the
 But then the fight was with the Soviet soldiers and they have confessed that they had a tremendous advantage of building bases in Pakistan during the war in Afghanistan
 taliban or al-kaayda ab vahi ranneeti america ke khilaaf bhi akhriyaar kar rahaa he
 The Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US Army, Michael Mullen, has also emphasized that the real concern of the US is about the large bases of terrorists in Pakistan and to end this war, America must first tackle this challenge
 jaahir he ab obama prashasan us galati ko nahin doharaana chahta jise bush ne kiya
 They have understood that if terrorism is to end, they will have to cut its roots and its root is in Pakistan

 aaie najar daalate hai karnataka chunaav main kin muddon kii charchaa ho rahi he
 On which issues the voter of Karnataka can determine the political fortunes of the state
 1
 On the strength of political face valuecm Siddaramaiah's face and Rahul Gandhi's strong campaign, while the Congress is busy on the mission of ensuring a second innings while retaining power, BJP is hopeful of returning to power through Modi wave and Yeddyurappa's Lingayat card 
 vahiin jedies bhi tisare player ke rup main kingmekar banane kii taiyaari main lagi he
 Kumaraswamy has tied up with the BSP
 unki takat ko bhi kam karke nahin aanka ja saktaa
 2
 bhrashtachar ke daag kisape kitne?karnataka chunaav main bhrashtachar kaa mudda chunaav prachaar main kaaphi teji se uchhaala ja rahaa he
 The Congress is raising the issue of corruption on the bjp's CM Face Yeddyurappa during the last term
 vahiin, bijepi kaa aarope he ki siddharmaiya ke shasankaal main karnataka main 3000 se zyada kisaanon ne aatmahatya kar lee lekin unke chaay-biscuit kaa bill karodon main aata rahaa
 In a Mysore rally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked the issue of corruption and questioned people whether you want a commissioned government or a mission
 isapar siddharmaiya ne palatwaar karte hue yedurappa ko nishane par liya or piem modi ko bhrashtachar main madadgaar tak kah daalaa
 Meanwhile, by giving tickets to the third Reddy brothers, the BJP has again given the Congress an opportunity to use Bellary's mining issue against itself
 3
 The question of farmers and the issue of Mahadayi can become an electoral problem in front of the Maaya government, the drought crisis that has been going on for the last 4 years
 goa se mahadaayi nadi ke pani ke bantwaare ko lekar siyasat garm he
 The Mahadayi or Mandovi river starts from Bhimgarh in the Western Ghats of Belagavi district in north-western Karnataka and joins the Arabian Sea via Goa
 mahadaayi nadi karnataka main 29 kilometre, jabaki goa main 52 kilometre bahati he
 7 from Goa since Karnataka 2001
 6 arab cubic feet nadi kaa pani chhodane kii maang karata aa rahaa he
 With this he wants to meet the needs of 4 districts including Drought affected Dharwad
 goa ko isi par aapatti he
 However, in December on the initiative of BJP President Amit Shah, Goa CM Manohar Parrikar took the initiative to increase the water quota by negotiating the Mahadayi issue
 iskaa bijepi ko phayda ho saktaa he
 The issue of the Mahadayi River is very important for North Karnataka and may affect 25 seats
 4
 Where is the development agenda? In this political fortress of the south, the Karnataka model of Congress is presenting a challenge in front of Modi's Gujarat model
 siddharmaiya kaa daawa he ki unki nitiyon ke kaaran karnataka lagaataar do saal 2016 or 2017 main nivesh ke lihaaj se desh main sabase agada rajya rahaa
 The Siddaramaiah government claims that they provided free education to girls, making the state number one in solar power
 lekin bijepi congress sarkaar kii growth story ko sire se khaarij karti he
 BJP president Amit Shah claims- 'the relationship between Congress and corruption is very deep, so deep as it is about fish and water and the Siddaramaiah government has increased it even further
 iti sector ke itnaa majboot hone ke baavjood yahaan abhi tak 24 ghante bijli nahin rahati he
 The health and central government schemes have also not been implemented properly
 3500 se zyada kisaan aatmahatya kar chuke hai
 Talking of development, the Congress is going down in all parameters
 ham is halaat ko badalenge

 kannada gaurav kaa sawalvidhansabha chunaav se pehle kannada gaurav yaa kannada swabhimaan kaa mudda sabase zyada surkhiyon main he
 Siddaramaiah of Congress is airing this issue
 iske tahat railway se kaha gaya ki vah tikaton par kannada bhashaa kaa prayog kare
 Information in Kannada language was started at Kempegowda International Airport
 kai vimaanan companiyon ne kannada bhashaa main soochna dene kii shuruyaat kii
 Under this campaign, the Siddaramaiah government also announced the separate flag of Karnataka and it was passed from the cabinet and sent to the Center for approval
 vidhansabha chunaav ko lekar bhaajapa ne ise ‘ek desh’ kii avadharana ke viruddh bataaya, lekin chunaav main kannada gaurav sabase bada mudda banakar ubhara he
 BJP may face difficulties with this

 The most important issue in maths in Karnataka elections is religion and caste
 yahaan chunaav ladane vaali teenon partiyaan- congress, bhaajapa yaa janata dal (es), sabhi dharm or jati ke aadhaar par karnataka kii satta hasil karne kii kavayad main lage hai
 Actually the state has monasteries of various castes, which have innumerable followers
 in jatiyon main lingayat, vokkalinga, kurub yaa ahinda or dalit pramukh hai
 Some of the stake is also with Muslim voters
 isliye sabhi partiyaan in jati-samudaayon ko apane paksh main karne main lagi hai
 The Congress has waged a separate religion status for Lingayats and has tried to fail Yeddyurappa's Lingayat card through it
 vahi bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ise lingayat netaa yediurppa ko siem banane se rokane kii congress kii koshish qaraar de rahe hai
 7
 dakshin karnataka or bijepi kaa hindutv cardkarnataka main bijepi hindutv ke agenda par juty he
 The BJP and the Sangh have created an atmosphere in the southern districts of Karnataka where there are Muslim dominated areas
 samudr tat se sate zilon main bhaajapa ne hindutv ke mudde par kaafii kaam kiya he
 It is their built ground
 muslim voton par siddharmaiya pakad banane kaa daawa kar rahe hai to isi card ke jariye bijepi hindutv kaa agenda aage laane main juty he
 a BJP MLA even termed this election as an election between Hindus and Muslims
 2011 kii janaganana ke aankadon ke anusaar karnataka main kul 224 main se 35 vidhansabha siten aisi hai jahaan musalamaanon kii aabaadi bees pratishat yaa usase zyaada he
 The Congress denies the possibility of a dent by the JDS in this vote bank
 dakshin kannada ke mangaluru or udupi zilon ke ek taraf kerala kaa kasargoda kaa ilaaka he jahaan khadi deshon main kaam karne vaale musalmaan paise kamakar yahaan apane ghar bhejte hai or inhi paison se islamic sanghathan chalate hai
 At the same time, the name of the organization which is facing allegations of Islamic fundamentalism is PFI i
e
 'popular Front of India'
 isaki sakriyata isi ilaake main he
 Vishwa Hindu Parishad is active in this area and efforts have been seen to bring the discussion from Love Jihad to Land Jihad

 The manifesto of the public is getting a different atmosphere in the state capital and the major IT hub of the country, Bangalore
 ‘citizans for bengaluru' naamak ek swatantra samooh ne shahar ke alag-alag hisson se logon ko ekajute kiya or uske saath hone vaali rozaana kii mushkilon par charchaa kii
 On this basis, the people's manifesto was prepared and handed over to all political parties
 isamen logon ne trephic niyam, pradooshan niyantran, kachra prabandhan se lekar nai nitiyon ko lagu karne ke liye behatar yojanaon jaise muddon kii baat rakhi
 It will now be seen how much these issues are included in the agenda of political parties
 9
 Dalit card In the Karnataka election, the Dalit card is also no less important
 rajya kii aabaadi main dalit samudaay kaa hissaa kareeb 20 fisadi he
 The Dalit vote bank is effective in 100 seats
 inamen se 36 siten anusuchit jatiyon ke liye arakshit hai
 Interestingly, the Dalit vote bank in Karnataka is divided
 sabhi dalon ke apane-apane sameekaran hai
 Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge comes from the Dalit community
 congress essi / asti act main badlaavon ke mudde ko bijepi ke khilaaf istemaal karne kii koshish kar rahi he to bijepi jorshor se ise congress kii bhram failaane kii koshish qaraar de rahi he
 However, the Madiga community of Dalits is angry with the Congress for not implementing the report of the Commission on Internal Reservation in SC and BJP can get their support
 paramparaagat taur par dalit voton par congress kii pakad maani jaati he
 But the swing of Dalit votes was seen as a major reason for bjp's victory in the 2008 elections
 tab 36 arakshit siton main se bijepi 22 jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 However, in 2013, the Congress returned and won 17 of these seats
 is votbank par jedies kii bhi najar he
 It is constantly trying to get Dalit votes in its favor in alliance with BSP
 10
 Change equations after the last election
 Tell us that in the 2013 assembly elections, the Congress won 122 out of the total 224 seats in the state
 jabaki bijepi 40 or jedies ne 40 siton par kabja kiya tha
 The KJP of BS Yeddyurappa, who had contested with the BJP, could win just 6 seats
 iske alaava anya ko 16 siten mili thi
 However, Yeddyurappa later joined the BJP again and this time the CM is declared a candidate
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main halaat ekadam alag the
 BJP managed to win 17 seats out of 28
 jabaki 9 siten congress ke haath lageen
 2 seats went to JDS account
 is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main lingayat voton, hindutv card, modi lahar ke sahare bijepi ko is dakshini rajya main satta main vaapasi kii ummid he
 It has to be seen on what issues the people of Karnataka decide the mandate

 But even after 4 o'clock in the evening, when there was no time left for the court to hear the petition, the court said that now we will be able to hear the matter in November itself
 bataate chalem ki uniform civil code ko lekar somvaar ko hi dilli hai court main ek nai yachika daakhil kii gai thi
 The petition calls for a Uniform Civil Code to secure gender justice, equality and the dignity of women

 gati kya he, gati ke niyam kya he
 How many rules has Newton given for speed
 in sabko jaanane ke liye padhein gati, sadish, duuri, chaal or veg
 Scalar quantity: a physical amount that has only magnitude
 disha nahin, use adish raashi kaha jaataa he: jaise - dravyaman, chaal , aaytan, kaary , samay, urja aadi
 Note: These are all scalar quantities of electric current, temprature, pressure
 sadish raashi (vector quantity):waisi bhautik raashi jinamein pariman ke saath-saath disha bhi rahati he or jo yoga ke nishchit niyamon ke anusaar jodi jaati hai, unhen sandish raashi kehete hai: jaise- veg, visthpan, bal, twaran aadi
 Distance: The length of the path traveled by an object in a given time period is called distance
 yah ek adish raashi he
 It is always positive (+ ve)
 visthaapan (displacement):ek nishchit disha main do binduon ke bich kii lambavat duuri ko visthapit kehete he
 This is the vector sign
 iskaa S

 maatrak meter he
 Displacement can be positive, negative and zero
 chaal (speed):kisi vastu ke visthaapan kii dar ko chaal kehete hai
 Ie speed = distance / time
 This is a scalar amount

 Velocity: The rate of displacement of an object or the distance traveled by an object per second in a certain direction is called velocity
 yah ek sadish raashi he

 twaran (acceleration):kisi vastu ke veg main parivartan kii dar ko twaran kehete hai
 Its s
 I
 The unit is m / to ^ 2
 yadi samay ke saath vastu kaa veg ghatata he to twaran rinatmak hota he, jise mandan (retardation ) kehete hai
 Circular motion - When an object moves on a circular path, its motion is called circular motion
 yadi vah ek samaan chaal se gati karti he to uski gati ko ek samaan vrittiya gati kehete hai
 The homogeneous circular motion is an accelerating speed as the direction of velocity changes each point
 koniya veg (circular and motion) vrutakar maarg par gatisheel kan ko vrut ke centre se milaane vaali rekha ek second main jitne kone se gum jaati he, use us kan kaa koniya veg kehete hai
 It is often manifested with ω (omega)
 yani ki ω = ѳ / t 
 If the particle rotates n in 1 second, then ω = 2π n
 (kyonki 1 chakkar main kan 2π (360 degree) radian se gum jaati he) ab yadi vrutakar maarg kii trigya r he or kan 1 second main n chakkar lagaataa he to uske dwaara ek second main chali gai duuri = vrutt kii paridhi x n = 2 πrn, yahi uski rekhiy chaal (linear speed) hogi
 That is, v = 2 πrnv = 2π nxr = ω xr (ω = 2 π n) Linear speed = angular speed x Motion of radius - Newton's laws of motion: Newton, the father of physics, wrote his book in 1687 AD The first law of motion was propounded in "principia"
 newton kaa pehla gati-niyam (newton's first law of motion ):yadi koi vastu viraam avasthaa main he to vah viraam avasthaa main rahegi yaa yadi vah ek samaan chaal se sidhi rekha main chal rahi he, to waisi he chalati rahegi, jab tak us par koi bahari bal lagaakar uski vartmaan avasthaa main parivartan na kiya jaae
 The first law is also called Galileo's law or law of inertia
 bahya bal ke abhaav main kisi vastu kii apni viramavastha yaa samaan gati kii avasthaa ko banaae rakhane kii pravatti ko jadtv kehete hai
 The first law gives the definition of force
 bal kii paribhaasha:bal vah bahya kaarak he jo kisi vaastu kii praarambhik avasthaa main parivartan karata he yaa parivartan karne kii cheshtaa karata he
 Force is a vector sign

 (ii) chalati hui motor car ke achaanak rukne par usamen baithe yatri aage kii ore jhuk jate hai
 (iii) Holding the blanket by hand and beating it with the poles, the dust mites fall

 Ie momentum = velocity x mass
 This is a vector amount

 Newton's second law of motion: The rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the force exerted on that object
 tathaa samveg parivartan kii disha main hota hai ab yadi aropit bal F, bal kii disha main utpann twaran a evam vastu kaa dravyaman m ho, to newton ke gati ke duusare niyam se f = ma yani ki newton ke duusare niyam de bal kaa vyanjak praapt hota he
 Note: The first rule is part of the second rule
 newton kaa tritiy gati niyam (newton's third law of motion):prayek kriya ke baraabar, parantu vipareet disha main pratikriya hoti he
 Examples: (i) when the gun is fired, the driver is pushed backwards (ii): backwards when jumping from the boat to shore (iii): in flying the rocket
 samveg sangrakshan kaa siddhant:yadi kanon ke kisi samooh yaa nikaay par koi bahya bal nahin lag rahaa ho, to us nikaay kaa kuch samveg niyat rahata he
 That is, the momentum before and after the collision is equal
 aaveg (impulse):jab koi bada bal kisi vastu par thode samay ke liye kaary karata he, to bal tathaa samay antaraal ke gunanfal ko us bal kaa aaveg kehete hai
 Impulse = force x time interval = change in momentum
 a velocity is a vector amount whose unit is newton seconds (ns), and its direction is the same as that of force
 abhikendriya bal (centripetal force):jab koi vastu kisi vrittakar maarg par chalati he, to us par ek bal vrutt ke centre kii ore kaary karata he
 This force is called concentric force
 is bal ke abhaav main vastu vrittakar maarg par nahi chal sakati he
 If an object of m mass is moving along the circular path of radius r with v speed, then the required centripetal force towards the center of the working circle is f = mv ^ 2 / r
 apkendriya bal (centrifugal force):ajadatviya frem (non -inertial frame) main newton ke niyamon ko lagu karne ke liye kuch ese balon kii kalpana kerani hoti he, jinhen parivesh main kisi pind se sambandhit nahi kiya ja saktaa
 These forces are called pseudo forces or inertial forces
 apkendriya bal ek aisa hi jadtviya bal yaa chhadam bal he
 Its direction is opposite to the centripetal force
 kapada sukhaane kii mashin, doodh se makkhan nikaalane kii mashin aadi apkendriya bal ke siddhant par kaary karti hai
 Note: On the circular path, there is a reaction of the centripetal force acting on the moving object, as in a "well of death" the motorcycle exerts an inward action on the wall of the well, while its reaction force is applied by the motorcycle to the well's wall
 Work outwards
 kabhi-kabhi baahar kii ore kaary karne vaale is pratikriya bal ko bhramavash apkendriya bal kah diya jaataa he, jo ki bilkul galat he
 Moment of force: The tendency of the body to rotate an object through an axis is called force-moment
 kisi aksh ke paritah ek bal kaa bal-aghurna us bal ke pariman tathaa aksh se bal kii kriya rekha ke bich kii lambavat duuri ke gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 [ie force-moment (T) = force x moment arm] This is a vector amount

 saral mashin (simple machines):yah bal aghurna bal ke siddhant par kaary karti he
 a simple machine is a device in which the load placed on another point is carried by applying force on a vantage point
 jaise uttolak, ghirani, aanat tal, scru jaik aadi
 Lever: a lever is a straight or crooked rod, which can move freely around a certain point
 uttolak main 3 bindu hote hai:(i) aalamb (fulcrum):jis nishchit bindu ke chaaro ore uttolak kii chad swatantraapurvak gum sakati he use aalamb kehete hai
 (ii) Aayas (effort): The force applied on the lever to use it is called aayas
 (iii) bhaar (load):uttolak ke dwaara jo boj uthaaya jaataa hai, athwa rukaawat hataai jaati he, use bhaar kehete hai
 Types of levers: There are 3 types of levers: (i) First class lever: In this class lever, the lamps F, Ayas e and weight w are located in between
 is prakaar ke uttolkon main yantric laabh 1 se adhik, 1 ke baraabar tathaa 1 se kam bhi ho saktaa he
 Examples of this are: scissors, pilash, mirror, swing, cycle brake, hand pump etc
 (ii)dwitiya shrenee kaa uttolak: is varg ke uttolak main aalamb f tathaa aayam e ke bich bhaar w hota he
 The mechanical advantage of this type of lever is always more than one
 iske udhaaharan sarauta, neembu nichodne kii mashin, ek pahie kii kooda dhone kii gaadi aadi
 (iii) Leviticus of the three-tier: In the lever of this class, the bearing f is I, e in the middle of weight W
 udhaaharan chimata, kisaan kaa hal, manushya kaa haath
 Center of gravity: The center of gravity of an object is the point where the entire weight of the object works
 atah gurutvakentre par vastu ke bhaar ke baraabar uparimukhi bal lagaakar ham vastu ko santulit karte hai, chaahe vah jis sthiti main rakhi jaaen
 The weight of the object acts just below the center of gravity
 at: gurutv centre par vastu ke bhaar ke baraabar upreemukhi bal lagaakar ham vastu ko santulit rakh sakate hai
 Types of equilibrium: There are 3 types of equilibrium- Permanent, Temporary and Neutral: (i) Stable equilibrium: If an object is displaced slightly from its equilibrium position and once the force is removed, it again returns to the previous position

 Once a proud bowler from Grace had said that the British spectators come to see the batting of Grace and the bowling of an arrogant bowler
 vah gendbaaj unhen out karne ke liye utawala tha, lekin gres krij par date rahe
 We too should now apply that essential principle to Sachin Tendulkar
 ham unhen sauvaan shatak banane den or phir nae sire se ek bilkul nai team khadi karen
 There should be a 17 year old player in that team, who can become our next Sachin
 sachin tendulkar ke liye kathor shabdon kaa istemaal karnaa shaayad galat he
 They still have the ability to score runs
 lekin sachin mumbai ke mahaan khilaadi vijay marchent kii us tippanee ko shaayad yaad karnaa chahen, jisamen unhone kaha thah aapako us samay ritair ho janaa chahie, jab log yah puuchhen ki kyon? na ki ye puuchhen ki kab? lekin marchent us peedi ke the, jab test khilaadi ko videshi tour par kharch ke liye pratidin ek pound sterling miltaa tha
 Those players did not even know how to pronounce 'crore' with seven zeros
 mujhe galat mat samajhie
 Today money dominates the game
 isamen kuch bhi aniatik nahin he, lekin paise se javabdehi bad jaati he
 Whereas Indian cricket is controlled through a system in which administrators, selectors, players and their chosen commentators protect each other
 mere liye australia usee din ajey ho gaya tha, jis din vahaan ke captain maaikel clark ne don breadman ke score ko paar karne se inkaar kar diya
 If they wanted, they could easily break their record
 lekin khud se upar mahaj team kaa hit nahin tha, balki yah australia ke itihaas ko shradhanjali thi or ek yuva pratibhashali khilaadi badi vinamrata se hamase kah rahaa tha ki vah unke sammaan ko bikharane nahin degaa
 If there was a border-gavaskar trophy for the charges, the Indian players would have returned with a lot of money
 gautam gambhir kaa yah aarope ochhaa tha ki mejabaan ne apane anukool pich taiyaar karai
 Losing is not a bad thing, but crying does not suit after defeat
 bharat haar se nahin, balki baar-baar taash ke mahal kii tarah dhahne se sharmasaar hua
 There is no doubt that the players never let their performance come in the way of pretending in front of the camera
 ye profeshnal hai
 After all, they spend more time on television than the stars of TV serials
 yahaan tak ki nayaa khilaadi bhi ek over main chaar genden short or ek phul daalkar bade tiraskaar se ampire kii taraf dekhakar munh banaata he
 He never accepts his mistake

 big bos doctoron se do naam lene ke liye kehete hai jo is ilaaj kaa hissaa banenge
 After thinking they call Apoorva and Sangram
 marijon ko lab main bulaae jane ke baad doctor unhen ilaaj ke bare main bataate hai
 Apoorva and Sangram are said to make Mohawk hairstyles
 manaa karne par point jannatavaasiyon ko mil jaaenge
 Everyone outside the house is watching this task on TV
 shilpa baahar se hi chillaati hai ki apurva ko manaa kar dena chahie
 Apoorva and Sangram feel that they too are being fooled like Andy
 ve ilaaj ko taiyaar ho jate hai
 Apoorva talks about going first
 jab asif or armaan asal main unke bal kaatane lagate hai to shilpa chillane lag jaati he or ghar ke saamaan ko yahaan-vahaan phenkane lagati hai
 She also cries in the bathroom and Gauhar tries to calm them down
 apurva ke baad sangram kii baari he
 The fight ensues as Sangram is confused to seek treatment
 vah sangram ke saath gaali-galouj par utar jaataa he
 Sangram, who considers Armaan as friend and brother, is surprised by his behavior
 armaan lagbhag uskaa iraadaa badalane main safal hone vaale hote hai, or apurva hakeekat ko nahin pahchaan pate hai or sangram se kehete hai ki vah unka dhyaan bantane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Upon realizing that the truth has been revealed, Armaan apologizes to Sangram
 ve lab se baahar aate hai, sab unke hausalon kii tarif karte hai
 Shilpa starts crying after seeing Apoorva's hair, but Shilpa calms down after Apoorva is tied up
 der shaam ko task khatm hota he
 Bigg Boss praises the souls

 Ellie misses her father, because his birthday is coming soon
 sab uskaa hausala badhaate hai or big bos se is maukey par kek bhejne ke liye kehete hai
 Here's how to handle: sambhavit sawaal: If you are in any of these three categories, then handle relatives in three ways- yaa to muskuraakar baat vahiin khatm kar den;yaa kuch der ke liye dhirh ban jaaen or palatakar unpar hi tikhe sawaal daag den;yaa phir unase, zarurat na ho to bhi, suzav maang len
 What other people should not give to the best friend, these three advice should be given after marriage

 He is heard spitting fire against Pakistan at short intervals, warning him
 kabhi vah pakistan-adhikrut kashmir (pok) ko lekar daawa karte hai, kabhi vah chetavanee dete sunai dete hai ki bharat parmaanu hathiyaaron ke 'pehle istemaal nahin' kii niti se bandhaa hua nahin he
 Just 24 hours ago, he said that Pakistan could soon be blacklisted by the international anti-terrorism unit FATF; Six days ago, Rajnath Singh warned Pakistan to 'improve', reminding it of its collapse and the formation of Bangladesh in 1971; a week ago, he reiterated an old declaration that 'pakistan will only talk about pok in future, not about Jammu and Kashmir
 
 
 'rajnath singh kaa is shikari swaroop main aa janaa achaanak nahin hua he
 He was also a strong, calm and capable home minister in the first government of Narendra Modi, and kept calm keeping in mind the unwritten rule that Modi's ministers needed to be seen, not heard
 is baar, north block (grih mantralay) se south block (raksha mantralay) pahunch jane ne unhen badal daalaa he
 Two weeks ago, he flew in the home-built light combat aircraft 'tejas', and during that time he left his favorite dress, the dhoti-kurta and wore a compression suit
 PM narendra modi ne rajnath singh se pakistan ke khilaaf bharat ke chautarafa hamale main sheersh bhoomika adaa karne ke liye kaha, kyonki isse do laabh hai
 This would have saved his prime minister, Narendra Modi, from being seen as the most aggressive, and as a global leader it makes him comfortable to rise above the india-pakistan issue
 isse pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ko nicha dikhaanaa bhi behad aasaan ho jaataa he ki modi to unke bayanon par pratikriya tak nahin dete, or imran ke dher uksaavon ke baavjood yah kaam apane mantriyon ke zimme chhod diya karte hai
 a disenchanted politician and close to the RSS, Rajnath Singh also grabbed the occasion to make himself a favorite of the Sangh and bjp's base, for whom attacking Pakistan is an all time favorite task
 so, jab narendra modi khud ko global getkiper kii bhoomika main dhaal rahe hai, vahiin grahamantri amit shah kashmir or assam ko lekar sakht rukh apanaate hai, or seemapar kii ladaai kii zimmedaari rajnath singh ne sambhaal lee he
 Rajnath Singh, a two-time president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had earlier established himself as a farmer leader (the dhoti is also mentioned above) and gave his speeches in line with his political ideal, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee Used to mold on darasal, maine ek television intervyuu ke dauraan unase poocha tha ki kya vah apane haavbhaav kaa shrey atal-ji ko dete hai, to vah hans die the or kaha tha ki donon hi uttar pradesh se hai, or purv pradhanmantri unke adarsh rahe hai
 Sources close to Rajnath Singh say that he is very happy with his more powerful tenure as the defense minister than ever before
 sutron ne kaha, "mananeey ke vichaar hameshaa se aise hi the, bas, ab vah unhen saarvajanik rup se vyakt kar sakate hai
 
 
 "however, this is not entirely the case, as now Rajnath, who started appearing in 'predator Mode', had also once presented himself as a peacekeeper and talked about Atal-ji's promise of humanity in Kashmir"
 lekin vah tab kii baat he
 The Sangh Parivar is happy with the new 'shikari Rajnath Singh'
 is rukh ko apana lene se rajnath ko bhi khud ko BJP ke lutian netritv se alag dikhaane kaa avasar hasil hua he
 Rajnath was considered a member of the trio along with the late Arun Jaitley and the late Sushma Swaraj
 ab vah us saanche se baahar nikal aae hai, or modi-shah kii jodi se kareeb se jude nazar aane lage hai
 This is a big leap within the party and the government
 iskaa arth yah hua ki vah pakistan kaa santulan digane ke liye is tarah kii chetavaniyaan jari karte rahenge
 ICC chief executive Aaron Lorgat will meet PCB chairman Ejaz Batt in London in the wake of the spot-fixing scandal

 ) 25 july ke din salmaan khan chinkaara maamle main adaalat se bari ho gaye
 The court said that Harish Dulani, a witness in this case, never came to court
 isliye adaalat ke paas paristhitiyon se sambandhit sakshya hi rah gaye hai or wo aparyaapt hai isliye salmaan khan bari kiye jate hai
 The witness that people were talking about for two days has arrived
 faisla bhi aa gaya he, jis gavaah ke kaaran salmaan khan bari hue wo gavaah bhi aa gaya he
 His name is Harish Dulani
 inkaa kahana he ki inaki gavaahi hi nahin hui
 The court says that summons was issued but it did not come
 buudhvaar kii shaam jab hamaari sahyogi harsha kumari singh or jodhpur ke sahyogi arun harsh ke saath harish dulani enditivi par aae to ek misaal banakar aae
 That example is that our investigative agencies can also dodge the courts in gathering their evidence
 jis gavaah ko gaayab bataaya gaya wo ab aapke saamne haazir he
 The comments harish dulani ne enditivi india ke zariye apane liye suraksha kii maang kii he
 He says that his life is threatened due to the high profile case
 harish dulani salmaan khan cese ke akele gavaah hai
 He was the driver of the car from which Salman Khan went hunting
 is ghatana ke baar harish dulani kii zindagi badal gai or salmaan khan kii manzil bhi
 He reached the verdict of innocence and Harish Dulani yearned for his testimony
 ab inase bhi sawaal to banataa he ki jab court ne samman jari kiye to ye court main kyon nahin aae
 Why did he face the questions of Salman Khan's lawyers
 magistrate ke saamne inkaa 164 kaa bayaan ek majboot sakshya tha, magar use sandigdh or badha chadhaakar diya gaya bayaan bataaya gaya he
 Salman Khan was accused of shooting a film at Bhawad near Jodhpur and hunting a chinkara on September 26, 1998
 uske do din baad, 28 sitambar 1998 ko jodhpur ke ghoda farm main ek duusare chinkaara ko maar giraaya
 On 1 October 1998, Salman Khan was also accused of hunting black deer
 salmaan khan ko kaale hiran ke shikaar ke aarope main giraftaar bhi kiya gaya or 5 din baad zamaanat par reeha kar diya gaya
 Salman was sentenced to 1 year and 5 years in both these cases in the lower court, but after 18 years, Salman Khan was acquitted of all cases of chinkara poaching
 rajasthan sarkaar ne kaha he ki pehle wo court ke faisle ko padhegi phir supreme court main apil kaa vichaar karegi
 Harish Dulani has demanded protection for himself through NDTV India
 unka kahana he ki hai profile cese ke kaaran unki jaan ko khatra he
 Harish Dulani is the lone witness in the Salman Khan case
 ve us car ke driver the, jisase salmaan khan shikaar karne gaye
 After this incident, the life of Harish Dulani changed and the destination of Salman Khan too
 wo begunaahi ke faisle tak pahunch gaye or harish dulani apni gavaahi ke liye tarasate rahe
 Now the question arises from these also, why did they not come to the court when the court issued summons
 kyon inhone salmaan khan ke vakeelon ke sawaalon kaa saamana kiya
 His statement of 164 before the magistrate was a strong evidence, but it has been described as suspicious and exaggerated
 salmaan khan par aarope tha ki ek film kii shooting ke dauraan wo jodhpur ke paas bhavad main the or 26 sitambar, 1998 ko ek chinkaara kaa shikaar kiya
 Two days later, on 28 September 1998, another chinkara was shot dead at a horse farm in Jodhpur
 1 aktubar, 1998 ko salmaan khan par kaale hiran ke shikaar kaa bhi aarope laga
 Salman Khan was also arrested for hunting black deer and was released on bail 5 days later
 nichali adaalat main in donon maamalon main 1 saal or 5 saal kii sazaa salmaan ko sunai gai, lekin 18 saal baad salmaan khan chinkaara shikaar ke sabhi maamalon se bari ho gaye
 The Rajasthan government has said that it will first read the court's decision and then consider an appeal in the Supreme Court

 a top US daily has said in its report that Pakistan is unwilling to clash with Afghan militants, seeing the deepening ties between India and the US, and even high-level visits by US officials to Islamabad
 Could not be celebrated
 washington post ne apni khabar main kaha ki america raksha mantri rabart gates or pakistan tathaa afghanistan ke liye america ke vishesh doot richard holbrook kaa haalia daura bhi pakistan ko aatankwaad ke khilaaf puri tarah sangharsh ke liye nahin manaa sakaa
 The newspaper said in its news release from Islamabad, 'according to analysts, a major obstacle is the close relationship between the US and India
 ’ isamen bataaya gaya he, ‘bharat-pakistan ke rishte avishvaas main funs gayi hai, jisamen bharat ko 2008 main mumbai main hue aatankwaadi hamale ke peeche pakistan kii santh ganth hone kaa andeh he tathaa pakistan ko andeh he ki bharat, pakistan virdohi gatividhiyon ke liye afghanistan kaa istemaal karata he
 The newspaper says that some Pakistanis have developed mistrust due to similar American messages to India about the message of support from other leaders who have visited, including Gates and Hallbrook
 washington post ne likhaa he, ‘washington afghanistan main bharat kii sakriy bhoomika ko sthirataa ke bal ke taur par dekhtaa he lekin pakistan ko lagata he yah ek khatra he or vah virodh main samarthan jutaney ke liye iran sahit anya kshetreey deshon se sampark kar rahaa he
 This is despite the fact that Gates had proposed to him the Shadow Drones during his recent visit to Pakistan
 da post ne likhaa he, ‘vishleshkon ke mutabik anya baadhaon main pakistan kii yah chintaa he ki yadi iske sashastr bal abhiyaan kaa dayera badhaate hai or afgaan taliban ke sahyogiyon ke peeche padate hai to aisa karnaa kattarpanthi samoohon kii pratikriya ko nyotaa dena hoga, jinhone ab tak pakistan par hamalaa karne par roak laga rakhi he
 According to the newspaper, analysts and diplomats say the military's delaying policy is part of the move to seek more US military aid

 Even before this Pakistan has been given a befitting reply
 ab phir diya jayega
 The anger all over the country regarding this act of Pak is justified

 Pakistan should not be under the misconception that it will be successful in trying to bring down the morale of India
 ham pakistan kii aisi harkaton kaa karaara jawaab denge
 On the question of another surgical strike, Nirmal Singh said that our army is taking action and will give a befitting reply
 sena ke adhikari or suraksha se jude adhikariyon kii ranneeti ke hisaab se pakistan ko karaara jawaab diya jayega
 On the statement of former Defense Minister AK Antony, Nirmal Singh says that Antony is a very senior and serious leader
 unako desh se jude aise masale par raajnneeti nahin kerani chahie
 Pakistan is using terror to be a martyr for the country
 ham sabake liye or samaaj ke liye shahid hota he
 Therefore, there should not be politics in this
 ham paak ko jawaab denge
 Pakistan is using terror as a weapon
 paak sena aatankwaadiyon ke saath milakar aisi kyrana harakat kar rahi he
 He will definitely get an answer
 lutpaat paak kii baukhalaahat kaa nateejabank or hathiyaar luutane kii ghatnaon par nirmal singh ne kaha ki yah proxi waar chal rahaa he
 The robbery of the bank and the arms is the result of the furore

 After demonetisation, his money for hawala has become useless
 unako hathiyaar nahin mil rahe hai, jiske chalate vah aisi vaardaaton ko anjaam de rahe hai
 Everyday terrorists are being killed

 India has accused Pakistan of taking a major toll in investigating the Mumbai attacks
 mumbai hamalon main pakistan kii aadhikarik agenciyon kaa haath hone kaa aarope lagaate hue bharat ne kaha he ki is baat ko sabit karne vaale tamaam saboot maujuud hai
 The neighboring country is neither investigating this aspect on its own nor allowing the FBI to do so
 duusari ore pakistan ke ucchayukta ne shanivaar ko kaha ki pakistan mumbai hamalon ke silsile main apane sawaalon par bharat se mili javaabon kii jaanch kar rahaa he
 In a program by the Indian TV channel, Union Home Minister P
K
 chidambaram ne kaha ki 26 november kii ghatana ke silsile main hiraasat main liye gaye logon se poochtacha main pakistan ko jo jaankaree mili hogi, use usne saajha nahin kiya he
 He said that India would pressurize it to ensure that the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks could be brought to justice
 chidambaram ne kaha, kaaphi saboot hone ke aadhaar par main yah anumaan laga saktaa hum ki (pakistan kii) aadhikarik agensiyaan, (mumbai hamalon main) shaamil thim
 This inference can be denied only when the contrary evidence comes out from the investigation
 yah poochne par ki kya pakistan kii aadhikarik agesiyon par ungali uthaane vaale saboot nishkarsh nikaalane laayak yaa mahatvapurn sanket dene vaale hai, chidambaram ne kaha ki abhi main yah nahin kah saktaa
 For this, it will need to be investigated on the land of Pakistan
 yah pataa lagaana hoga ki kya aatankwaadiyon ne yah khud apane boote kiya he
 But we have not been allowed to investigate
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi (sonia Gandhi) or unke donon bacchon rahul (rahul Gandhi) evam priyanka (priyanka Gandhi)kii espiji suraksha waapas liye jane ke centre sarkaar ke faisle kii kadi ninda karte hue punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne shuukravaar ko ise puri tarah ‘‘raajnneeti se prerit'' bataate hue is faisle ko waapas lene or suraksha behaal karne kii maang kii
 The Chief Minister of Punjab has urged the Central Government to reconsider its decision
 khaas taur se desh main maujuuda suraksha paridrishy ko dekhte hue, jab seemaa paar se aatankwaadiyon ke hamale kaa khatra roj bad rahaa he
 Amarinder said that keeping in mind the brutal assassination of Sonia Gandhi's husband and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and her mother-in-law and former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the Gandhi family needed spg's protection, not political grace
 kuch maheene pehle purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii espiji suraksha waapas liye jane ko yaad karte hue captain ne kaha ki in donon main se koi bhi faisla jamini vaastaviktaa ke aadhaar par nahin kiya gaya
 Former Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin and former Pakistan captain Younis Khan participated in the fourth session 'superhit Captain' of Salaam Cricket
 seshan ko senior agxcutive editor sports vikrant gupta ne sanchalit kiya
 Younus Khan said- i learned a lot from Mohammad Azharuddin
 unki captaini ko lekar maine bahut kuch siikhaa
 When the last time of my career was going on, during that time many critics targeted me
 tab ajju bhai (mohammad ajaharuddin) ne mujhe ne kaha- jaise gendbaaj krij kaa istemaal karte hai to batsman bhi krij kaa istemaal kar sakate hai or aap nets main isko tri karen
 Younus Khan said - Cricket should be such that used to be in the 70s and 80s, in today's era, the burden of cricket is more on the player
 aap india ko dekh le jab pakistan ne champions trophy jiti to bhartiya khilaadiyon par kitna pressor tha
 Younus Khan said - There is a lot of pressure between India and Pakistan, because of this, players like Dada (sourav Ganguly) were captained
 ajahar ne kaha ki jab ham 1999 ke vishwa cap main pakistan se khel rahe the, to hamen pataa tha ki yuddh chal rahaa he or ham seemaa par lard rahe sainikon ke liye match jeetna chaahate the
 Azhar said that Kargil war was going on at that time and all the soldiers of our country were fighting on the border
 isliye is match ko jeetna hamaare liye or bhi zyada jaruri ho gaya
 Because at that time we wanted to give victory to our soldiers by defeating Pakistan in the World Cup match
 jab kargil kaa yudhd chal rahaa tha tab pakistan se jab match jeet gaye
 Younus Khan said - In this tournament, TV will probably break more
 younus khan ne kaha- aaj ke khilaadiyon par zyada pressor he, kyonki media or soshal media kaaphi active he
 Younus Khan said- It cannot be that in today's time no cricketer reads a newspaper
 ajahar ne kaha- bhartiya team is asia cap main kaaphi majboot he
 i do not know the new players of Pakistan and but i have heard that they are excellent
 rohit sharma kaaphi dinon baad cricket khelenge to acha karenge
 Bangladesh's team is also very dangerous and cannot be ignored
 ajahar ne kaha- viraat kohli ke nahin khilne par team unako miss karegi
 The board should explain why Virat Kohli is not playing in the Asia Cup
 yah kohli ke liye bhi acha rahegaa ki board khud is bare main safai de
 Otherwise Kohli says something, the board says something
 isse behatar he ki vah khud hi bataae ki unke nahin khilne ke peeche peeth dard he yaa koi or kaaran
 Azhar said- the difference in the Champions Trophy was Mohammed Aamir's bowling
 unke aane se pakistan majboot hui he or pakistan nae-nae tej gendbaaj paidaa karata he
 If the Pakistan team plays on its strength, then whom can it beat
 pakistan yuai main shandaar khelti ai he
 Younis said - Team India will miss Kohli as he is in form and India will surely miss him in this tournament
 bharat or pakistan nervas kaa match he
 Younis Khan said - When Dhoni scored 148 runs against Pakistan, he felt that he would become a big player, Mahi became the captain and took the team far ahead
 younus ne kaha ki har team kaa apana napha-nuksaan rahata hi he
 India has lost in England, but can improve rapidly
 vahiin pakistan kii team lagaataar sudhaar kar rahi he, hamaare paas badhiya olerounder hai, badhiya kshetrarakshan he
 But when such encounters happen, it is exciting
 imran khan ke satta main aane ke baad kya bharat-pakistan main cricket ke rishte sudharenge, is par ajahar ne kaha ki is sambandh main kadam pakistan ko aage badhanaa chahie
 The Pakistan Cricket Board has come to the favor and they do not know what kind of person he is, but Pakistan will have to take steps in this regard
 aaj kii nai peedi puraane khilaadiyon se nahin milti or kuch bhi raay nahin leti, is par ajahar ne kaha ki aaj kii peedi aisa nahin kar rahi
 This is the fault of the players
 sunil gavaskar ek bade khilaadi rahe hai
 He was present in England and no one came to meet him
 seekhney ke liye khilaadiyon ko khud hi approach karnaa padegaa
 If you think that i will not go to anyone, then it is wrong, you can learn from anyone
