 america raashtrapati chunaav main rus ke dakhal maamle kii jaanch kar rahi FBI ke ghere main donald trump ke damaad jaired kushanar bhi aa gaye hai
 The case is being investigated over the role of Jared Kushner, senior White House adviser
 darasal, kushanar or roosi adhikariyon ke bich baithak hui thi, jiske chalate unke rus se gathjod kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 In addition, FBI officials believe that Kushner can provide significant evidence of Russian incumbency in the US presidential election
 ab america jaanch agency trump ke chunaav abhiyaan se jude dastavej, kushanar se purv rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar maaikel flin se gathjod or kushanar ke rus se sampark ko dhyaan main rakhkar jaanch kar rahi he
 Recently, Trump removed Flynn from the post on charges of an alliance with Russia
 haalanki FBI ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki philhal maamle main kushanar ko aaropee nahin banaaya gaya he
 In December 2016, Kushner met with Russia's Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak and Russian banker Sergey Gorvok
 saath hi trump ke chunaav abhiyaan ke data enelitict oparation kii nigaraanee kii thi
 However, it is not yet clear whether the FBI will question Kushner about the case
 Regarding this Kushner's spokesperson says that they do not have any information in this regard
 vahiin, kushanar kii atorni jaimi goralic ne kaha ki agar maamle main FBI unke client se sampark karti he, to vah sahyog karenge
 In addition to the FBI interference in the US presidential election, several Congress committees are investigating
 kushanar america raashtrapati donald trump kii beti ivaanka trump ke pati hai
 Trump has earlier been sidelined since James Komi, who is investigating the case, has been removed as FBI chief
 maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand ke vidhansabha chunaav loksabhaa chunaavon ke saath hi karaane ke bare main jaldi hi antim faisla hone kii sambhaavna he
 According to BJP sources, the party high command will negotiate with the state units and decide on this
 gauratlab he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi saare chunaav ek saath karaane kii vakaalat karte rahe hai
 In such a situation, with the general elections in April May, the discussion of holding elections of these states has also started
 vaise bhi aam chunaavon ke saath andhra pradesh, odisha, arunachal pradesh or sikkim ke chunaav hone hai
 There is a possibility that assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir will also be held simultaneously
 haalanki bijepi shasit maharashtra, jharkhand or haryana kii bijepi ikaiyaan jaldi chunaav karaane ke paksh main nahin hai
 He believes that there are several important tasks of the state governments that need to be completed
 haryana vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal do november 2019 tak he
 Jharkhand till 5 January 2020
 jabaki maharashtra vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal nau november 2019 tak he
 Regarding holding elections simultaneously, the NITI Aayog has said in its report that it can start with the Lok Sabha elections this year
 iske liye jhaarankhad, maharashtra or haryana ke vidhansabha chunaav lok sabha chunaav ke saath hi karaane chahie
 For this, the tenures of Maharashtra and Haryana Legislative Assembly can be cut by five months and the tenure of Jharkhand Assembly can be cut by seven months
 maharashtra main shivasena ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar halaat teji se badal rahe hai
 Shiv Sena had earlier announced to contest separate elections
 lekin ab sambhaavna he ki donon partiyaan saath hi chunaav laden
 The Shiv Sena wants seats to be divided with the Lok Sabha as well as the Assembly
 pichhali baar donon partiyon ne loksabhaa chunaav ek saath lekin vidhansabha chunaav alag-alag ladaa tha
 In such a situation, it is believed that in Maharashtra, it may be decided to hold assembly elections along with the Lok Sabha
 udhar, haryana main sabaki nazren jind ke vidhansabha upachunaav par tiki hai
 BJP leaders say that assembly elections should be held on time
 lekin agar bijepi jind kaa vidhansabha upachunaav jitati he to party alaakaman loksabhaa ke saath hi vidhansabha ke chunaav karaane kaa suzav de saktaa he
 a big reason for this is the bjp's success in local elections and scattered opposition
 jharkhand main rajya ikai kaa maananaa he ki jaldi chunaav karaane se koi laabh nahin hoga
 According to him, the big plans of the state government are yet to be worked out
 aise main behatar hoga ki jharkhand kaa chunaav samay par hi karaayaa jaae
 He said that for some time their security will be enhanced
 adhikari ne kaha, ‘
 
 
 There is no specific alert but security around his house has increased since the verdict
 ’ adhikari ne yah nahin bataaya ki unki suraksha main kitne pulicekarmiyon ko tainaat kiya gaya he

 He said, 'luxury is not for me at the shops and it is luxury for me to go out and spend time in a forest with a friend of the house
 meri team bhi aisa karti he or lagjri ek chote vakt ke liye hoti he
 Amrapali's creative director Tarang Arora said that now customers have to take care of their favorites
 agar koi product india main bana he, to aap tradishan ke liye usamen hathi ghode nahi laga sakate
 Therefore, it has to be sold in a creative way
 unka maananaa he ki bharat ke log videsh main bhartiya brands dekhte hai or phir bharat aakar us par bharosa karte hai
 At the same time, with the change of time, people also want new

 It is no longer that people do not buy houses, where they can rest
 wo aisi koi jagah nahin chaahate, jahaan jaakar aaraam kar sake
 Actually, they want a place where every part of life is an experience

 They believe that India is even more difficult and customers also become smart and now ask for special items and they know what to buy

 He also appealed to Mamata Banerjee to immediately call the NDRF team for relief and rescue work

 At the same time, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said, 'I am very worried about this accident
 ham raahat evam bachaav team se jaankaree le rahe hai or isaki nigaraanee kar rahe hai
 We want to go back as soon as possible

 jaahir he, jab bazaar tarah-tarah ke aakarshak saamaanon se ata padaa ho to kanfusion vaazib he
 We solve your confusion and tell you what to buy on this auspicious day
 sabase pehle to dharmik baat he ki diwaali main dhaatu kharidni chahie
 If we go ahead with this, we can see that on this occasion people used to buy utensils, etc
, as well as silver goods
 bazaar main electronic saamaanon kii bharmaar hone ke kaaran isamen thodi kami aa gai
 But it would be better to buy metal items only
 is baar sone ke daam gir rahe hai or uske bhavishya par kaaphi anischitata dikh rahi he
 It does not seem that now its prices will increase
 satorion or niveshkon donon kii ruchi isamen ghatati ja rahi he
 Therefore it would not be right to invest in it
 agar phir bhi aapaki isamen dilchaspee he to sone ke sikke kharid sakate hai or vah bhi kisi mmatisi jaise sarkari santhaan yaa kisi bank vagairah se
 On Monday, gold coins (eight grams) were being sold at the wholesale market of Delhi at the rate of Rs 24,300 per piece
 lekin is dhanteras main sabase acchhee kharidari chaandi ke saamaanon kii rahegi
 Silver is currently touching the earth
 uske bhav somvaar ko thodaa badhkar 38,850 rupye prati kilo ho gaye the
 Even at this rate, it is quite a good deal
 aapako yaad hoga ki chaandi ke bhav kuch maheenon pehle badhkar 76,000 rupye prati kilo tak chale gaye the
 Obviously this feeling is very good
 bullian marchents association ke mahaamantri shrikrishna goyal chandivaala ne kaha ki chaandi kharidne ke liye isse badhiya avasar nahin ho saktaa he kyonki is diwaali chaandi apane nunatam str par he
 Its shopping is better in every way
 nivesh ke liye to isse badhiya or kuch nahin ho saktaa he
 He advised that coins can also be purchased from silver jewelery or a reliable shop
 inaki kharidari phaayde kaa sauda he
 Silver is also used in the manufacture of industrial goods and some electronic goods
 isliye iske daam badhane ke puure asaar hote hai
 He said that silver coins had increased by Rs 1,000 per hundred coins in Delhi's wholesale market on Monday
 ye badhkar 70,000 rupye prati saikadaa ho gaye the
 Even at these prices, it is wise to shop
 iske alaava agar aap apni jarurat kii koi cheez kharidte hai lekin andhadhundh saamaan khareednaa uchit nahin hoga
 Jyotishacharya Praveen Mishra says that if you buy silver, then it is correct because buying a metal on Dhanteras is logical
 unhone kaha ki mitti ke diye or lakshmi-ganesh kii murti bhi aaj kharidni chahie

 By the way, Jammu and Kashmir did not have a good start, the third day unbeaten batsman Bandeep Singh was out early, after which Ian Singh and first innings century Shubham Khajuria added 52 runs for the third wicket
 ian singh ko 30 ke score par vishaal dabholkar ne pavilion bheja
 At the same time, Khajuria, who scored 107 runs in the first innings, returned to the pavilion with the help of 140 balls with 10 fours and a six and a return catch to Iqbal Abdullah
 iske baad khajuriya ne captain parvej rasul ke saath chauthe wicket ke liye 53 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 Rasool also became Dabholkar's second victim by scoring 32 off 38 balls
 donon wicket 171 ke score par gir gaye, lekin hardip singh ne naabad 44 ran banaakar jammu-kashmir ko jeet tak pahunchaa diya
 a bowler like Ram Dayal was also instrumental in the victory, who took eight wickets in the match
 apane gendbaazon ke pradarshan par coach sunil joshi ne kaha, is pich par aisi gendbaazi karnaa badi baat he, in khilaadiyon ne vaaki kadi mehnat kii he
 This victory is a gift for Jammu and Kashmir

 Is it not the responsibility of the Prime Minister to speak on this? gauratlab he ki mahangaai or bhrashtachar jaise ahm muddon par bhaajapa pradhanmantri kii lagaataar aalochana karti rahi he

 Suresh Rao Joshi, the head functionary of the Sangh, said at the Bapurao Lele Smriti Journalism Award ceremony on Friday night, 'the term Hindu terrorism was first used
 ab bhagava aatankwaad shabd kaa istemaal ho rahaa he, lekin koi mujhe bataaye ki yah bhagava aatankwaad kya hota he
 Without naming anyone, Joshi accused that words like saffron terrorism were being used under a large conspiracy hatched against the Hindu community, so that this community could be brought to justice
 unhone ‘bhagava aatankwaad’ shabd ko shabdaawalee se dur rakhane par jor diya or kaha ki aise shabd bhartiya samaaj ke poshak nahin ho sakate
 Former Chief Justice of India Deepak Misra arrived to discuss 'self-respect, life and will death' in Agenda Aaj Tak

 Deepak Misra said that there is no harm if someone wants to get rid of their physical suffering, to get rid of incurable merge
 yah aatmahatya nahin he kyonki aisa vyakti sammaan ke saath maranaa chahta he or yah uskaa adhikaar he
 Justice Deepak Misra started his speech stating that he is among those who believe in saying that the glass is half full rather than saying that the glass is half empty

 Deepak Misra said that recently he read a book by Neuro Scientist 'proof of Heaven'

 It gives information about how to be born again
 mrityu koi badi cheez nahin he
 Misra, the half-winger of the will death, said that John Ryden has said that there are two parts to life
 jivan or mrityu
 Death keeps teasing life all the time

 Nobody wants his father to die
 lekin donon saath nahin chal sakate
 The earlier belief was that a life in which there is no suffering is not a life
 mrityu kii prakriya bina ksht ke honi chahie
 We all want to live
 unhone yaksha or yudhisthir ke bich hue samvaad kaa zikr kiya
 Yaksha had asked Yudhishthira what is the biggest wonder of life? In response to this, Yudhishthira had said that everybody sees death every moment but behaves as if they will never die
 vah anant samay tak jivit rahenge
 Nobody wants to die, does not want to suffer, why are we afraid of death, when death will happen, there is no life when there is life, not death
 jise dekha hi nahin usase dar kaisaa
 Charvak was a philosopher who did not believe in reincarnation, so he used to talk about taking ghee with a loan
 ichha mrityu kab or kyon?justise deepak misra ne kaha ki agar koi gahare ksht main he, uskaa ilaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa

 Socially, the question will arise that who will decide to be given death
 isamen praavdhaan he ki isamen vil taiyaar kerani hogi
 Referring to the patient who had filed the petition, Justice Deepak Misra said that he had said that do not question my existence, if you are asking this question then you are playing with my life, do not question it comfortably
 Let go main nahin chahta ki main ksht main manru, kyonki aatma nahin mar rahi he
 No one has the right to insult me
 log ichha mrityu ke bare main jaagruk honjustise deepak misra ne kaha ki wo chaahate hai ki sab log iske bare main jaagruk hon vah maut ke bare main nahin bol rahe hai vah jivan ke bare main bol rahe hai
 When death comes, come comfortably, come slowly, come before me, i do not want mercy

 Meanwhile, the government has become very active about the cashless system
 log bhi apni taraf se sakriy ho gaye hai
 People have downloaded mobile wallets from metros to towns
 inaki maang main kaaphi teji ai he
 The State Bank of India is receiving orders for 50,000 swipe machines every day
 maang adhik he or ab aapurti kii shikaayat he
 In the Economic Times of Wednesday, there was a news that before 8 November swipe machine used to have three lakh transactions every day, now it has become 1
5 million
 swip kii sankhya to bad gai he magar prati swip len-dein kaa ausat mulya kaaphi gir gaya he
 Earlier, when fewer people used debit cards, they used to spend Rs 2700 per transaction
 ab log prati swip 2000 kii hi kharidari kar rahe hai
 If this figure is correct then people are using the card but are not spending it
 credit card or debit card se kharch kii bhi seemaa hoti he
 That limit is determined by the economic status of the consumer
 vitt mantri ke hi shabd hai ki cash ke saath-saath deal karnaa iskaa ek iconomik cast bhi he isliye sarkaar or bank prayaas karte hai ki digital karency kaa zyada se zyada istemaal kiya jaae
 Digital currency means debit card credit card
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki card, i-wolet se petrol or dijal kharidne par 0
 There will be a 75 percent discount
 sarkaar 1 xxrep 4 0 kii aabaadi vaale har gaanv ko do point aaf cell mashin muft degi
 This will bring 75 crore people under this machine
 ek janvari se upnagaron ke railyatriyon ko digital madhyam se tikat kharidne par 0
 5 percent discount will be available
 aanaline tikat kharidne vaale rail yatriyon ko 10 lakh kaa beemaa milegaa
 There will be a discount of 5 percent in the fare of catering and railway retiring rooms for purchasing online train tickets
 agar card se 2000 kii kharidari karenge to koi seva shulk nahin lagegaa
 Through online, the premiums of public sector insurance companies will get 8 to 10 percent discount
 toll plaza par digital pement karne waalon ko 10 pratishat kii chhot milegi
 Without these concessions, there were reports of a surge in digital payment channels
 phir sarkaar ne kahin maamuli to kahin 10 pratishat tak kii chhot kyon di he
 The hotel sector is also concerned about the swipe machine as to why give two percent of its earnings
 kya sarkaar unhen bhi chhot degi
 It is also not clear how long this exemption is for
 kuch dinon ke liye he yaa sthai rup se
 The Finance Minister said that you buy petrol diesel worth Rs 1800 per day
 notebandi ke baad 360 karod kii kharidari digital madhyam se ho rahi he
 If this purchase starts daily of 540 crores, then the demand of two lakh crores cash will be reduced in the purchase of petrol diesel in a year
 tippaniyan We do not know how many hundred crore transactions have gone digital in the rest of the sector and based on that, how many lakh crores of cash will be reduced in a year
 hamen dekhnaa hoga ki digital pement main jo vruddhi hui he, vah kis sector main hui he
 Meaning if 100 new people have used the card, then most of them are filling petrol or buying more things
 laghu se lekar madhyam or bade udyogon ko jo is dauraan ghaataa hua he, vah kis khate main hisaab dikhaaya jayega, uski bharpai yah tamaam sector kaise karenge
 Let us also try to understand that if the currency of demonetisation was in circulation around 15 lakhs and a half, if it has come to the banks worth eleven and a half lakhs of rupees, then what does it mean? agar sara paisa bainkon main aa gaya to kyon mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kaa abhiyaan safal nahin hoga
 Do we also have to believe that the money that came into the banks was white
 sarkaar kahati he ki khaaton kii sakhti se jaanch hogi
 Some accounts are being done, but are there so many employees in income tax departments who will be able to check these crores of accounts
 kitne dinon main kar lenge
 The second question is what the Finance Minister wants to achieve by reducing the circulation of two lakh crores of cash, out of the Rs
 1
5 lakh crores, if two lakh crores of currency becomes digital, then what is the purpose of the government
 media cashles likh rahaa he lekin dhyaan rakhiegaa sarkaar les cash kii baat kar rahi he
 Do not later say that the government was called cashless
 ham yaa aap ek aankada or dekh sakate hai ki 8 november se pehle jo digital bhugtan ho rahaa tha vah kitne lakh karod kaa tha
 There was a decrease in cash requirement from him
 yah sab sawaal hai
 The Finance Minister says that the Prime Minister could have chosen the easy path like other Prime Ministers, but he chose the difficult path
 is sankraman kaal main jo pidaa hui he use lekar afsos he lekin yah kadam saaf suthri arthvyavastha or behatar jidipi kii taraf le jayega
 This will give banks more funds to lend
 aatankwaad se ladane kii baat kii jagah ab cashles, les cash or bainkon ke paas fund kii baton ne le lee he
 But banks have funds but even after a month, people in queues in front of banks are asking where their funds are
 kataron tasviren notebandi kii pratik tasviir bani hui hai
 There is a claim of supply of notes but atms are closed at various places
 bhartiya reserve bank ne bataaya he ki 10 november se 5 disambar ke bich abhi tak 3 lakh 81 hajaar karod mulya ke nae noton kii supplai kii ja chuki he
 The daily currency of demonetisation of November 8 was worth 15 lakh crore
 bhartiya rigerv bank kaa kahana he ki pichley teen saal main jitne noton kii supplai hui he usase zyada tees din se kam samay main kii gai he
 Even taking an average at this pace, it may take four to five months for the government to exchange new notes in exchange for old ones
 media report main atm mashin se sambandhit ek company ne daawa kiya gaya he ki 95 pratishat atm mashin ko 500 or 2000 rupee ke nae noton ke vitaran ke yogya bana diya gaya he phir bhi 35 fisadi atm main hi cash he
 In most places banks maintained the system with the help of local police, yet reports of people dying due to the emergence of health problems due to the line kept coming
 line main hi baccha paidaa hone kii khabar bhi ai
 One side is saying that everyone is in support of the decision, while the other side is saying that people are very upset
 unka paisa unheen ko nahin mil rahaa he
 In Ludhiana, the woman who went to the bank to get money for her daughter's wedding, died of a heart attack
 singaar cinema road sthit punjab neshnal bank kii chandigarh shakha ke baahar subah 6 baje se hi log line main lag gaye the
 Asha Rani, 48, wanted to withdraw money for her daughter's wedding
 mritak mahila ke parijanon ne suraksha guard par dhakka mukki kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Angry people demonstrated outside the bank by placing the corpse
 logon ne sarkaar se muaavje or insaaf kii maang kii he
 On Wednesday outside a bank ATM in Bagalkot district of Karnataka, the soldier pushed and assaulted a retired army 55-year-old Nandappa
 ritred faujee cash lene ke liye atm ke baahar khadey the
 When they started going inside, the soldier was enraged and misbehaved with them
 aaropee sipaahi ko suspend kar diya gaya he
 By the way, people generally maintained order in front of banks
 police ne bhi kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana kiya hoga
 It was alleged that the government took this decision without preparation, many people were saying that the decision was fine but there was no preparation to implement it but on Wednesday the Reserve Bank of India said that the decision of demonetization was not in haste Was taken rather after discussing every aspect in detail
 is bich sarkaar cashles system ko lekar kaaphi sakriy ho gai he
 People have also become active on their behalf
 mahanagaron se lekar kasbon tak main logon ne mobile wolet downlod kiya he
 Their demand has increased significantly
 state bank aaf india ko hi har din 50,000 swip mashin kaa order aa rahaa he
 Demand is high and supply is now complaining
 buudhvaar ke iconomik times main khabar chhapi thi ki 8 november ke pehle swip mashin se har din teen lakh len-dein hota tha, ab 15 lakh ho gaya he
 The number of swipes has increased but the average value per swipe transaction has fallen considerably
 pehle jab kam log debit card kaa istamaal karte the to prati len-dein 2700 rupee kharch karte the
 Now people are buying 2000 per swipe
 agar yah aankada sahi he to log card kaa istamaal to kar rahe hai lekin kharch nahin kar rahe hai
 Credit cards and debit cards also have a spending limit
 upabhokta kii aarthik haisiyat se vah seemaa tay hoti he
 The words of the finance minister are that it is an economic cast to deal with cash and this is why the government and banks try to use digital currency more and more
 digital karency matlab debit card credit card
 Finance Minister has said that 0 on buying petrol and diesel from card, e-wallet
 75 pratishat kaa discount milegaa
 The government will provide two point of sale machines free of cost to every village with a population of 10,000
 isse 75 karod log is mashin ke daayre main aa jaaenge
 0 for purchasing tickets through digital mode to train passengers from suburbs from 1 January
 5 pratishat kii chhot milegi
 Rail passengers buying tickets online will get 10 lakh insurance
 aan line rail tikat kharidne par katering or railway ritearing room ke kiraaye main 5 pratishat kii chhot milegi
 There will be no service charge if you purchase 2000 from the card
 aanaline ke jariye saarvajanik kshetra kii beemaa companiyon kaa premium dene waalon ko 8 se 10 pratishat kii chhot milegi
 Those who make digital payments at the toll plaza will get a rebate of 10 percent
 in riyaayaton ke bagaiyr hi digital bhugtan ke madhyamon main oochaal kii khabaren aa rahi thim
 Then why has the government given a rebate of up to 10 per cent at some point
 hotel sector bhi swip mashin ko lekar chintit hai ki apni kamai se do pratishat kyon den
 Will the government give them a discount too? yah bhi saaf nahin he ki yah chhot kab tak ke liye he
 Is for a few days or permanently
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki aap roj 1800 rupee kaa petrol dijal kharidte hai
 After demonetisation, 360 million purchases are being made through digital medium
 agar yahi kharidari 540 karod kii rose hone lage to ek saal main petrol dijal kii kharidari main hi do lakh karod cash kii maang ghat jaaegi
 The comments ham nahin jaanate ki baaki sector main kitne sau karod kaa len-dein digital hua he or uske aadhaar par saal main kitne lakh karod cash kii kami aa jaaegi
 We have to see in which sector the increase in digital payment has taken place
 matlab agar 100 nae logon ne card kaa istemaal kiya he to inamen se zyaadaatar petrol bharaa rahe hai yaa or bhi chijen kharid rahe hai
 In which account will be shown the losses that have been lost to small to medium and large industries during this period, how will all these sectors compensate
 ham yah bhi samajhane kaa prayaas karen ki notebandi ke roj agar saadhe 15 lakh ke aasapaas karency chalan main thi, agar inamen se ab tak saadhe gyaarah lakh karod mulya kii karency bainkon main aa gai he to iske kya myne hai
 If all the money comes to the banks then why is it believed that the government's campaign will not be successful
 kya hamen yah bhi maananaa hoga ki bainkon main jo paisa aayaa vah safed hi tha
 The government says that the accounts will be strictly investigated
 kuch khaaton kii to ho rahi he lekin kya iskar vibhaagon main itane karmchaaree hai jo in karodon khaaton kii jaanch kar sakenge
 How many days will you do it
 doosraa sawaal he ki vitt mantri do lakh karod cash ke chalan ko kam karke kya hasil karnaa chaahate hai, saadhe 15 lakh karod kii karency main se agar do lakh karod kii karency digital ho jaae to sarkaar kaa koun sa makasad puraa hota he
 Media is writing cashless but keep in mind that the government is talking about lace cash
 baad main mat kahiega ki sarkaar ne cashles kaha tha
 We or you can see a figure and how the digital payment that was happening before 8 November was worth lakhs of crores
 usase cash kii jarurat main kitni kami aa rahi thi
 These are all questions
 media report main atm mashin se sambandhit ek company ne daawa kiya gaya he ki 95 pratishat atm mashin ko 500 or 2000 rupee ke nae noton ke vitaran ke yogya bana diya gaya he phir bhi 35 fisadi atm main hi cash he

 Some accounts are being done, but are there so many employees in income tax departments who will be able to check these crores of accounts
 kitne dinon main kar lenge
 The second question is what the Finance Minister wants to achieve by reducing the circulation of two lakh crores of cash, out of the Rs
 1
5 lakh crores, if two lakh crores of currency becomes digital, then what is the purpose of the government
 media cashles likh rahaa he lekin dhyaan rakhiegaa sarkaar les cash kii baat kar rahi he
 Do not later say that the government was called cashless
 ham yaa aap ek aankada or dekh sakate hai ki 8 november se pehle jo digital bhugtan ho rahaa tha vah kitne lakh karod kaa tha
 There was a decrease in cash requirement from him
 yah sab sawaal hai
 On Wednesday outside a bank ATM in Bagalkot district of Karnataka, the soldier pushed and assaulted a retired army 55-year-old Nandappa
 ritred faujee cash lene ke liye atm ke baahar khadey the
 When they started going inside, the soldier was enraged and misbehaved with them
 aaropee sipaahi ko suspend kar diya gaya he
 By the way, people generally maintained order in front of banks
 police ne bhi kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana kiya hoga
 It was alleged that the government took this decision without preparation, many people were saying that the decision was fine but there was no preparation to implement it but on Wednesday the Reserve Bank of India said that the decision of demonetization was not in haste Was taken rather after discussing every aspect in detail
 is bich sarkaar cashles system ko lekar kaaphi sakriy ho gai he
 People have also become active on their behalf
 mahanagaron se lekar kasbon tak main logon ne mobile wolet downlod kiya he
 Their demand has increased significantly
 state bank aaf india ko hi har din 50,000 swip mashin kaa order aa rahaa he
 Demand is high and supply is now complaining
 buudhvaar ke iconomik times main khabar chhapi thi ki 8 november ke pehle swip mashin se har din teen lakh len-dein hota tha, ab 15 lakh ho gaya he
 The number of swipes has increased but the average value per swipe transaction has fallen considerably
 pehle jab kam log debit card kaa istamaal karte the to prati len-dein 2700 rupee kharch karte the
 Now people are buying 2000 per swipe
 agar yah aankada sahi he to log card kaa istamaal to kar rahe hai lekin kharch nahin kar rahe hai
 Credit cards and debit cards also have a spending limit
 upabhokta kii aarthik haisiyat se vah seemaa tay hoti he
 The words of the finance minister are that it is an economic cast to deal with cash and this is why the government and banks try to use digital currency more and more
 digital karency matlab debit card credit card
 Finance Minister has said that 0 on buying petrol and diesel from card, e-wallet
 75 pratishat kaa discount milegaa
 The government will provide two point of sale machines free of cost to every village with a population of 10,000
 isse 75 karod log is mashin ke daayre main aa jaaenge
 0 for purchasing tickets through digital mode to train passengers from suburbs from 1 January
 5 pratishat kii chhot milegi
 Rail passengers buying tickets online will get 10 lakh insurance
 aan line rail tikat kharidne par katering or railway ritearing room ke kiraaye main 5 pratishat kii chhot milegi
 There will be no service charge if you purchase 2000 from the card
 aanaline ke jariye saarvajanik kshetra kii beemaa companiyon kaa premium dene waalon ko 8 se 10 pratishat kii chhot milegi
 Those who make digital payments at the toll plaza will get a rebate of 10 percent
 in riyaayaton ke bagaiyr hi digital bhugtan ke madhyamon main oochaal kii khabaren aa rahi thim
 Then why has the government given a rebate of up to 10 per cent at some point
 hotel sector bhi swip mashin ko lekar chintit hai ki apni kamai se do pratishat kyon den
 Will the government give them a discount too? yah bhi saaf nahin he ki yah chhot kab tak ke liye he
 Is for a few days or permanently
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki aap roj 1800 rupee kaa petrol dijal kharidte hai
 After demonetisation, 360 million purchases are being made through digital medium
 agar yahi kharidari 540 karod kii rose hone lage to ek saal main petrol dijal kii kharidari main hi do lakh karod cash kii maang ghat jaaegi
 The comments ham nahin jaanate ki baaki sector main kitne sau karod kaa len-dein digital hua he or uske aadhaar par saal main kitne lakh karod cash kii kami aa jaaegi
 We have to see in which sector the increase in digital payment has taken place
 matlab agar 100 nae logon ne card kaa istemaal kiya he to inamen se zyaadaatar petrol bharaa rahe hai yaa or bhi chijen kharid rahe hai
 In which account will be shown the losses that have been lost to small to medium and large industries during this period, how will all these sectors compensate
 ham yah bhi samajhane kaa prayaas karen ki notebandi ke roj agar saadhe 15 lakh ke aasapaas karency chalan main thi, agar inamen se ab tak saadhe gyaarah lakh karod mulya kii karency bainkon main aa gai he to iske kya myne hai
 If all the money comes to the banks then why is it believed that the government's campaign will not be successful
 kya hamen yah bhi maananaa hoga ki bainkon main jo paisa aayaa vah safed hi tha
 The government says that the accounts will be strictly investigated
 kuch khaaton kii to ho rahi he lekin kya iskar vibhaagon main itane karmchaaree hai jo in karodon khaaton kii jaanch kar sakenge
 How many days will you do it
 doosraa sawaal he ki vitt mantri do lakh karod cash ke chalan ko kam karke kya hasil karnaa chaahate hai, saadhe 15 lakh karod kii karency main se agar do lakh karod kii karency digital ho jaae to sarkaar kaa koun sa makasad puraa hota he
 Media is writing cashless but keep in mind that the government is talking about lace cash
 baad main mat kahiega ki sarkaar ne cashles kaha tha
 We or you can see a figure and how the digital payment that was happening before 8 November was worth lakhs of crores
 usase cash kii jarurat main kitni kami aa rahi thi
 These are all questions
 vaise aamtaur par bainkon ke aage logon ne vyavastha banaae rakhi
 The police may have faced a lot of difficulties
 notebandi ko lekar yah aarope lag rahaa tha ki sarkaar ne bina taiyaari ke yah faisla le liya, kai log kah rahe the ki faisla thik tha magar lagu karne kii taiyaari nahin thi lekin buudhvaar ko bhartiya rigerv bank ne kaha ki notebandi kaa faisla jaldibaji main nahin liya gaya tha balki vistaar se har pahalu par vichaar vimarsh ke baad liya gaya tha
 Meanwhile, the government has become very active about the cashless system
 log bhi apni taraf se sakriy ho gaye hai
 People have downloaded mobile wallets from metros to towns
 inaki maang main kaaphi teji ai he
 The State Bank of India is receiving orders for 50,000 swipe machines every day
 maang adhik he or ab aapurti kii shikaayat he
 In the Economic Times of Wednesday, there was a news that before 8 November swipe machine used to have three lakh transactions every day, now it has become 1
5 million
 swip kii sankhya to bad gai he magar prati swip len-dein kaa ausat mulya kaaphi gir gaya he
 Earlier, when fewer people used debit cards, they used to spend Rs 2700 per transaction
 ab log prati swip 2000 kii hi kharidari kar rahe hai
 If this figure is correct then people are using the card but are not spending it
 credit card or debit card se kharch kii bhi seemaa hoti he
 That limit is determined by the economic status of the consumer
 vitt mantri ke hi shabd hai ki cash ke saath-saath deal karnaa iskaa ek iconomik cast bhi he isliye sarkaar or bank prayaas karte hai ki digital karency kaa zyada se zyada istemaal kiya jaae
 Digital currency means debit card credit card
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki card, i-wolet se petrol or dijal kharidne par 0
 There will be a 75 percent discount
 sarkaar 1 xxrep 4 0 kii aabaadi vaale har gaanv ko do point aaf cell mashin muft degi
 This will bring 75 crore people under this machine
 ek janvari se upnagaron ke railyatriyon ko digital madhyam se tikat kharidne par 0
 5 percent discount will be available
 aanaline tikat kharidne vaale rail yatriyon ko 10 lakh kaa beemaa milegaa
 There will be a discount of 5 percent in the fare of catering and railway retiring rooms for purchasing online train tickets
 agar card se 2000 kii kharidari karenge to koi seva shulk nahin lagegaa
 Through online, the premiums of public sector insurance companies will get 8 to 10 percent discount
 toll plaza par digital pement karne waalon ko 10 pratishat kii chhot milegi
 Without these concessions, there were reports of a surge in digital payment channels
 phir sarkaar ne kahin maamuli to kahin 10 pratishat tak kii chhot kyon di he
 The hotel sector is also concerned about the swipe machine as to why give two percent of its earnings
 kya sarkaar unhen bhi chhot degi
 It is also not clear how long this exemption is for
 kuch dinon ke liye he yaa sthai rup se
 The Finance Minister said that you buy petrol diesel worth Rs 1800 per day
 notebandi ke baad 360 karod kii kharidari digital madhyam se ho rahi he
 If this purchase starts daily of 540 crores, then the demand of two lakh crores cash will be reduced in the purchase of petrol diesel in a year
 tippaniyan We do not know how many hundred crore transactions have gone digital in the rest of the sector and based on that, how many lakh crores of cash will be reduced in a year
 hamen dekhnaa hoga ki digital pement main jo vruddhi hui he, vah kis sector main hui he
 Meaning if 100 new people have used the card, then most of them are filling petrol or buying more things
 laghu se lekar madhyam or bade udyogon ko jo is dauraan ghaataa hua he, vah kis khate main hisaab dikhaaya jayega, uski bharpai yah tamaam sector kaise karenge
 Let us also try to understand that if the currency of demonetisation was in circulation around 15 lakhs and a half, if it has come to the banks worth eleven and a half lakhs of rupees, then what does it mean? agar sara paisa bainkon main aa gaya to kyon mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kaa abhiyaan safal nahin hoga
 Do we also have to believe that the money that came into the banks was white
 sarkaar kahati he ki khaaton kii sakhti se jaanch hogi
 Some accounts are being done, but are there so many employees in income tax departments who will be able to check these crores of accounts
 kitne dinon main kar lenge

 co / 29vmnadyc5— Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar)january 10, 2016aapako bataa den ki afjal guru ko faansee ke baad unki patni tabassum ne kaha tha ab hamaara parivaar shanti ke saath baaki jindagi jeena chahta hai
 At that time, Ghalib had said that he wants to become a doctor
 usne bataaya tha ki vah jab tihaad jail main apane pita se milane gaya tha tab unhone use science kii kitaab or ek pen diya tha
 Ghalib Guru's mother Tabbusum, who lives in Sopore in North Kashmir, never put any effort in her studies
 bataaya jaataa he ki vah chaahati hai ki gaalib ek acha insaan ban naam roshan kare
 His father, Afzal Guru, left medical studies to prepare for civil services
 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye upi ke nateezon ke baad ab ye bahes kaa vishay he ki bispi ke saath gathbandhan banane se samaajawaadee party ko kya mila? isse pehle 2017 vidhansabha chunaav main party ke mukhiya akhilesh yadav ne congress ke saath gathbandhan kiya tha lekin bijepi ke saamne tab bhi daal nahin gal pai thi
 It is said that nothing last in politics but Samajwadi Party, which has the number 1 position in the politics of Uttar Pradesh, became the third party in the state in the last 3 years
 siton ke lihaaj se lekar vot pratishat tak samaajawaadee party lagaataar giravat dekhati rahi or guuruuvaar ko aae loksabhaa ke nateezon ne samaajawaadee party ko tisare paaydaan par dhakel diya
 Mayawati's party BSP, which had been wiped out in the last Lok Sabha elections and assembly elections, was able to make some comeback in the Lok Sabha elections this time
 20% se zyada vot or 10 siten lekar mayawati party or saakh donon bachaane main safal raheen
 The results of the Lok Sabha elections have raised the question whether Akhilesh Yadav continues to lose his shine and his father's political legacy
 raajnneeti main aisa aksar kam hi hota he jab koi apni puri raajnneetik kamai ko daanv par lagaakar bhavishya kii raajnneeti gadhata ho
 Akhilesh Yadav took this risk and after the defeat in the assembly elections, the stance of alliance with Mayawati was also reversed
 ek baar phir modi lahar main sab ud gaya
 In 2014, the Samajwadi Party won 5 seats by fighting alone and this time it also won only 5 seats by fighting with Mayawati, the last time all the five family members were able to save their seats, this time out of 5, all three members including Akhilesh's wife Dimple Yadav Also lost his seat
 akhilesh ghate main rahe lekin iskaa phayda mayawati ko hua, bispi shunya se 10 par pahunch gayi
 Mayawati is the only leader of the opposition who spoke to the press after the results of the Lok Sabha elections
 pradhanmantri modi ko haalanki jeet kii shubhakamanaayen mayawati ne nahin di lekin akhilesh ke dard ko jarur saajha kiya
 Akhilesh Yadav is the surveyor of his party
 akhilesh ke khilaaf party main raay rakhane vaale ab party se baahar ja chuke hai
 Even after this defeat on Akhilesh Yadav, no questions will arise from within the party, but this defeat has shaken the Samajwadi Party inside
 puure desh main ek hi rajya main do badi kshetreey takaton ne modi ke khilaaf aisa gathbandhan kahin nahin kiya tha
 The hope of stopping Modi's victory chariot across the country also rested on this alliance
 puure desh main uttar pradesh hi aisa tha jahaan voton kaa transfar jameen par dikhaai bhi de rahaa tha
 Despite this, if the Samajwadi Party has not been successful in increasing its stature, then the question arises on the decision of the alliance of Akhilesh Yadav
 sawaal is baat par bhi uthenge ki gathbandhan karne ke liye khud ko kahaan tak jhukaana sahi tha or kahaan-kahaan raajnneetik samjhauta sahi tha
 At the core of this alliance was the feeling that after this alliance, Mayawati would turn to Delhi and make a road in Uttar Pradesh for Akhilesh Yadav
 lekin ab jabaki mayawati ek baar phir dugani takat se majboot hokar ubhari he, muslim daliton kaa gathbandhan sabase safal rahaa
 In such a situation, it will not be easy for Akhilesh Yadav to claim from the alliance in 2022
 mulaayam singh parivaar ke bheetar bhi aawaaj mukhar hogi
 And also in the party
 lekin haar ke is postmortem main agar gathbandhan ke taur tareekon par sawaal uthe to akhilesh use kitni ahmiyat dete hai, ye dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 Narayan Dutt Tiwari, who joined the BJP due to his son's fascination after spending his entire political life in the Congress, was shocked by the BJP
 upi or uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri rah chuke 91 varshiandi tiwarividhansabha chunaavon main apane bete rohit shekhar ko tikat dilaane kii ummid main haath kaa saath chhod camel thama tha

 Dronacharya of politics was eaten up three times, Uttar Pradesh and once Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Narayan Dutt Tiwari taught the politics lesson to many, but this time he seems to have fallen victim to politics himself
 aisa to khud unhone bhi kabhi sochaa nahin hoga
 Due to the love of his son, Tiwari sometimes sat silently against his own chief minister, sometimes on hunger strike

 Who and when the structure resembled a bridge in the sea between India and Sri Lanka, or this naturally built secret, is very old, many things have been said about it
 bahut saare logon kaa yah maananaa he yah pul jise ramsetu ke naam se janaa jaataa he bhagwaan ram ne tab banaaya tha, jab vah srilanka main yuddh ladane ke liye ja rahe the
 But amidst the heat of the Gujarat elections, a new debate has been sparked once again about this very old mystery
 taaji bahes chhidane kii vajah ye he ki america ke ek science channel ne apni ek report main kaha he ki ramsetu main jo pathar mili hai vah asal main vahaan samandar main maujuud baaluu se bhi zyada puraane hai
 After this report, there has been a wave of happiness among the BJP leaders and they have got another chance to attack the Congress party
 ramsetu kaa mudda isliye bhi garma gaya he kyonki gujarat ke chunaav main rahul gandhi lagaataar mandiron ke darshan kar rahe hai or khud ko shivbhakt bataa rahe hai
 Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak on Wednesday that India's faith is not separate from science
 hajaaron saalon se agar desh ke logon ne ram kii katha ko mana he, krishna ke sneh ko mana he
 Now even science has confirmed this
 unhone kaha ki ham logon ke man main isko lekar kabhi bhi andeh nahin tha
 Today, Ram Katha is also called in Cambodia, Sumatra and Malaysia
 lekin kuch log aise hai jo ramsetu ke astitv par hi sawaal uthaa rahe the
 Referring to the UPA government, Ravi Shankar Prasad reminded that the previous government had submitted an affidavit in the court that Ram Sethu did not exist
 unhone maang rakhi thi ab congress party ko is bare main jawaab dena chahie
 Questioning Rahul Gandhi to visit the temples, Ravi Shankar Prasad asked that Rahul Gandhi is talking about Shiva Bhakti in Gujarat, but why his devotion to God shouts
 rahul gandhi ne ek press conference main mandiron main jane ke bare main puche jane par kaha tha ki kya mandir jane par koi roak he? iske baad ravishankar prasad ne unase sawaal kiya ki kya wo uttar pradesh main kabhi ram lalaa kaa darshan karne gaye? kabhi krishna janm bhoomi darshan karne gaye?ramsetu ke bare main report par khushi jaahir karte hue ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki hamaare liye khushi kii baat yah he ki appmerica kevaigyanikon ne vigyaan kii kasuti par parakh kar kaha he ki yah pathar samandar ke baaluu se bhi puraane hai
 He has said that Ram Sethu is not natural but people have placed stones there
 He said that there is a big win for us, it is a big thing for us

 On the one hand, for the Lok Sabha elections 2019, a trio of Bua, Babua and Chaudhary are preparing to challenge the BJP, where the picture is not clear if the Congress is taken along or not
 aise main congress ke bheetar upi ko lekar maathapai joro par he
 However, according to sources, the big leaders still consider this issue too hasty
 abhi loksabhaa chunaav main vakt he
 On 13 February, when the interim budget session ends, only then will the picture be revealed
 raajnneetik sutron kaa kahana he ki uske baad sarkaar naam kii cheez mahaj aupchaarikta hogi or jaanch agenciyaan mahaj mookadarshak
 Despite this, there remains duplicity within the Congress on the grand alliance
 pehali raay dilli ke bade netaaon or loksabhaa chunaav ke bade daavedaaron kii he, jo chaahate hai ki kisi bhi surat main congress ko mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa hona chahie
 This will not cause a scattering of votes against the BJP
 saath hi congress vipakshi dalon ko saath lekar chalane kaa sandesh bhi de paaegi
 On the recent developments, this faction says that it is political and to put pressure on each other and keep the last leaf close to the heart, then open it when the opportunity is its basic principle
 vaise bhi haal main hindi belt ke teen bade rajyon ke chunaav or chunaav baad congress ke saath sapa-basapa kii tanatani jagajaahir rahi he
 Therefore, one should not reach any hasty conclusion
 vahiin doosraa khemaa bhi he jo congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko apni nai daleel dene kii taiyaari main he or jaldi hi party adhyaksh ke saamne wo bhi apana paksh rakhenge
 This camp has its own arguments
 1
 The open rapport with SP in 2017 was damaging
 2
 In the case of the BJP on one side and the rest on the other, the BJP can also play polarization bets
 3
 There are many seats in urban areas in UP, where one section has been voting for national parties in national elections
 aise main bijepi ke saamne congress ummidavaar nahin hone kii surat main congress kaa vot mahagathbandhan ke bajaae bijepi ko ja saktaa he
 4
 mahaganthbandhan hone kii surat main congress yaa sapa kaa ummidavaar agar dalit nahin hua to wo bijepi kaa rukh kar sakate hai, vaise hi basapa yaa congress se yadav ummidavaar nahin hone kii surat main sapa kaa ye vot bijepi ko ja saktaa he
 After all, Modi will also have a face in this election
 5
 At the same time, on the lines of 1971, like the slogan of Indira Hatao of the opposition, the slogan of Modi Hatao can be raised
 6
 If the Congress candidate is strong in the Lok Sabha elections, then the first choice of the minority voters is the Congress, the example of which is the 2009 election
 7
 On the lines of 2009, the SP-BSP should have a strategic alliance with the Congress in terms of seats, that is, where the SP-BSP alliance is in a position to defeat the BJP, the Congress should give the candidate who can cut the BJP votes
 vahiin jahaan congress kaa ummidavaar bijepi ko haraane kii surat main ho, vahaan sapa-basapa bijepi ke vot kaatane vaala ummidavaar de de
 In such a situation, there is a challenge before Congress President Rahul Gandhi to choose one of the two routes, but his close admits that, firstly, he does not want the right to not have an alliance, burst on the Congress and the second is that a lot of water flows in the Ganges remains
 saath hi unka yah bhi maananaa he ki, raajnneeti main sirf plan a hi nahin hota, plan b or c bhi hota he

 Some of its provisions have played an important role in making China an economic powerhouse having recorded a growth rate of 10 per cent for 30 consecutive years

 The special thing is that by looking at the economic data, it is clear that these provinces are the most densely populated areas of China and with this dense population, China has succeeded in becoming the world's largest economy

 Therefore, to capture and beat an economy like China, it is necessary that Uttar Pradesh remains at the center of economic development in India as well

 According to the economic map of China, the two major regions East China and South Central China have more than 61 percent of the country's total population (38 million population in both areas)

 philhal china kii aarthik vikaas dar 6
 5 percent has been reached and the Chinese government claims that due to the major economic reforms it is running, China's economic growth rate will be more than 6 percent and less than 7 percent for the next 5 years
 5
 Despite this, these 6 provinces with dense population of China are still moving forward with growth rate of more than 8 percent
 gauratlab he ki china abhi bhi vaishvik vikaas kaa sabase bada khilaadi he
 China's economy alone accounts for 40 percent of the world's economy

 In order to capture or lag behind China in the global economy, it is important that states with densely populated areas in India be placed on the main frontline of economic development

 kuldeep or chahal ke saamne badi chunautibhartiya spin jodi ko ek saal ke baad pehali asli chunauti kaa saamana karnaa hoga, kyonki england ke ballebaajon ne manchester main mili haar ke baad tunrat vaapasi karte hue unki gendon kaa acchhee tarah saamana kiya
 If we talk, no rival team from Sri Lanka to Australia, New Zealand to South Africa have been able to break chahal-kuldeep's balls so easily in such a short time

 Between two defeats to the West Indies, India beat England 2–1 in a three-match T20 series at home ground in January 2017

 BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj, who has often given controversial statements, is again in the news for his statement
 unhone kaha ki netaaon ko apni soch badalani hogi, varanaa ve logon ke haathon pitane lagenge
 At the same time, he also advised that nobody should hurt the religious sentiments of the people
 isliye kahi aisi baat
 
 
 In fact, Sakshi Maharaj reached Bhubaneswar to attend a meeting organized by the International Hindu Federation
 yahaan jammu-kashmir ke nirdaleey vidhayak shaikh abdul raashid ko vidhansabha main peetane kaa mudda uth gaya
 Sakshi Maharaj came out in support of his party colleagues to beat Rashid
 unhone ise swaabhaavik pratikriya bataaya
 This happened with Rashid
 
 
 haal main bijepi ke vidhayakon ne jammu-kashmir vidhansabha main raashid par hamalaa kar diya tha

 We have completed one year in government, four years are still left
 pichley do dinon ke dauraan bihar bhaajapa ke do se adhik netaaon ne ek raag chhedaa hai ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ab rajya kii satta main pandrah varsh rah liye, isliye unhen bihar kii gaddi kii kaman ab bhaajapa netaa khaaskar susheel modi ko saunp kar dilli chale janaa chahie
 Chief Minister and President of Janata Dal United Nitish Kumar on Saturday addressed his party workers in view of the upcoming assembly elections in Jharkhand in Ranchi
 jahaan unhone sharabbandi par raghubar das sarkaar ko gheraa or bataaya ki kaise bihar har maamle main jharkhand se aage nikal chukaa hai
 After this, on Monday, BJP MLA Sanjay Paswan started the political controversy with a statement
 unhone kaha, ''bahut hua nitish kumaar
 Now he should go into Delhi politics and give the throne of Bihar to BJP leaders
 '' paswan ne apni pasand kaa mukhyamantri susheel modi ko bhi bataaya
 Janata Dal United's chief spokesperson Sanjay Singh said in response that when the public has given the mandate to Nitish Kumar then what is the need of this demand
 @nitishkumar is the Captain of NDA in Bihar & will remain its Captain in next assembly elections in 2020 also
 When Captain is hitting 4 & 6 & defeating rivals by inning where is the q of any change
 iske baad bhaajapa ke varisht netaa doctor seepi thakur ne kaha ki aglaa vidhansabha chunaav pradhanmantri narendra modi ke naam par endie ko ladanaa chahie
 He says that Narendra Modi's stature is much bigger than Nitish Kumar's and in recent times as his popularity has increased, it will be better to fight on his name and face
 isapar jawaab dene utre janata dal united ke rashtriya pravaktaa kasee tyaagi jinhone saaf-saaf kaha ki bhaajapa ke bayaan bhi netaaon ko apane badbhole bayaan se bachanaa chahie he or party padaadhikari banaati he lekin netaa hameshaa janata banaati he
 Tyagi even went on to say that BJP leaders should understand that Nitish Kumar is not on the mercy of anyone but on the mandate of the people, he has become the Chief Minister, so it is not known about Nitish Kumar among the leaders who are marginalized Why it becomes restless
 lekin jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki bhale upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne yah baat saafe kar di thi ki NDA main netritv ko lekar koi vivaad nahin he, lekin iske baavjood doctor thakur or sanjay paswan jaise netaa aise bayaan de rahe hai
 In fact, BJP leaders are trying to find out what the effect of their statements is in the guise of their personal statements
 saath hi saath bhaajapa kii ranneeti yah bhi he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko aage kar de or janata dal united ko baikfoot par laayaa jaae, jisase siton ke talmail main kuch zyaada tol-mol naa kare
 However, one thing is clear about BJP Nitish Kumar that it is better if he is not tampered with

 koisidi prakaranmein pakadaa ja rahaa he
 In view of this, it seems that he did not correct the selection of the candidates
 dikshit kaa kahana he ki arvind kejariwal agar yah baat kah rahe hai ki unhone turant karrwai kii he, turant mantri ko hataa diya he to baaki party bhi aise maamle aane par turant karrwai karti hai
 Kejriwal is not new

 He said that we took immediate action against Sandeep Kumar as soon as the matter came to light, while the other parties do not take any action
 sandip kumaar ko AAP se nikaalane par party legi faisla: jainjain kaa kahana he ki aam aadmi party or arvind kejariwal karactor or karpshan par koi compromij nahin karte hai
 He said that there may be a mistake in candidates selection from us, but there will be no delay in taking action
 yah pataa chalane par ki koi galat aadmi he yaa kisi ne galat kiya he, use bakhsha nahin jayega
 The party will decide what to do about removing Sandeep Kumar from the party

 The Congress and JDS together now have 106 mlas, including BSP and Independent mlas
 philhal basapa or nirdaleey vidhayak kaa kahana he ki ve gathbandhan sarkaar ke saath hai
 The Karnataka Legislative Assembly, which has 224 mlas (without speaker), has 211 members after the resignation of 13 mlas
 lekin spikar unka istipha manjuur karne main vakt le sakate hai
 If the speaker approves the resignation, the Kumaraswamy government will come in a minority and will not be able to pass the floor test
 rajya vidhansabha kaa 10 divasiy monsoon satr 12 july se hona he, jis dauraan maujuuda vitt varsh 2019-20 ke liye rajya ke bajet ko manjuuri di jaani he or lambit vidheyakon va vibhinn muddon par charchaa honi he, jisamen kisaanon kii karjamaafee, sookhaa raahat kaary or jal sankat shaamil hai
 It is worth noting that it is not a written process that the speaker should approve it after the resignation
 lekin maandand ke mutabik yah jald se jald manjuur hona chahie
 After the bjp's debacle in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly by-election, everyone is asking the same question, what will the party leadership do now? a suggestion has come from Union Minister and MP from Pilibhit Maneka Gandhi
 vah chaahati hai ki upi main varun gandhi ko badi jimmedaari mili
 When a private channel asked Maneka questions related to the bjp's defeat, he quickly put forward his son's name
 pehle to menka ne party kii haar par kuch bhi kehane se manaa kiya
 However, when asked about the absence of big leaders during the election campaign, he said that maybe we should bring him back (varun Gandhi)

 sonia gandhi ke lagaataar chauthi baar congress adhyaksh bananaa tay hone par bhaajapa ne kataaksh karte hue kaha ki jis tarah unhone pradhanmantri pad ke liye ‘balidaan’ dekar gandhi parivaar se baahar ke kisi vyakti ko us pad par bithaaya tha, usee tarah party ke sheersh pad par bhi unhen karnaa chahie
 bjp's chief spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said, "sonia is going to become Congress president for the fourth time
 swaabhaavik rup se unka koi virodh nahin hoga
 According to Article 6 of the Congress Party Legislation, no officer can hold the post of president of a block, district or state unit for more than two years
 ’sonia ke congress adhyaksh pad par shuukravaar ko nirvirodh chune jane kii ummid he

 He alleged that Sonia is the 'tallest leader of her party' and has no public accountability
 prasad ne kaha ki congress netaa hameshaa daawa karte hai ki sonia ne pradhanmantri pad ke liye ‘balidaan’ diya he
 In such a situation, it is even more important for Sonia to hand over the post of Congress president to someone outside the Gandhi family in accordance with her claims of adopting a democratic tradition and the spirit of party legislation
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa kaa maananaa he ki gandhi parivaar se baahar kai pratishthit netaa uplabdh hai, jo congress adhyaksh ban sakate hai
 He also said that there is a democratic process of election of office bearers in BJP
 prasad ne kaha, ‘ main congress party ko suchit karnaa chahta hum ki bhaajapa ke vidhaan ke mutabik chaahe blaak, jila, rajya yaa rashtriya str par ho, adhyaksh ko keval teen saal ke liye yah pad miltaa he

 After all, no Pakistani ruler has said: There is no place for any non-government armed force on our earth, whether they are Taliban or Lashkar, Pathan or Punjabi, foreign or native
 sabhi hamalon ke liye bas taliban ko hi kasuurvaar tehraaya gaya, yahaan tak ki afghanistan ke liye sahanubhuti bhi jataai gai or vahaan ke raashtrapati ashraf gani se sahyog ke vaade kii saraahna kii gai
 It was being said that it is not believed that this country is going through the biggest terrorist tragedy even when a similar attack took place on the Wagah border a few weeks ago
 iske baavjood vahaan ke hukmran apane doston or dushmano ko paribhaashit karne kaa tarika badalane nahin ja rahe, na hi ve said ko chup rahane ko kahenge
 There is no doubt that the Pakistani army's campaign against the Taliban is genuine
 yah ek aisa sainya abhiyaan he jaisaa kabhi bhi is upmahadweep main nahin dekha gaya
 It is openly using air strikes in which the help of the attacking helicopters is also being taken
 pakistani fouj khud ko hue nuksaan ko hameshaa saarvajanik nahin karti lekin agar uske military blog or bahes-mubaahison par nigaah daudaayen to aapako use hue gambhir nuksaan ke saboot milenge jisamen kai noujvaan afasaron kii bhi jaan gai he
 This war is real; And the army is wreaking havoc on the Taliban, that is why the Taliban has hunted its children this time
 aap shartiya taur par kah sakate hai ki kisi bhi sashastr vidroh yani rajasatta ko sangathit hathiyaarband chunauti kii raah main agar koi nirnaayak mode aata he, to vah yahi he
 Even in our country, this turning point in Punjab came in 1992 when Sikh terrorists started killing the families of policemen on a large scale
 iske baad hi punjab police ne tay kiya ki yah jang unki apni he or kuch hi maheenon main vah hasil kar dikhaaya jo ek dashak main sena or ardhasanya bal milakar bhi nahin kar paae the
 For the Pakistani army, the killing of their children in Peshawar should be one such turning point
 agar lage ki main daleel ko kuch batch-batch kar pesh kar rahaa hum to samajhe ki main aman kaa pairokaar hum or duusare bhartiya hone ke naate rajnatik rup se sahi dikhnaa chahta hum
 There is no such limit for my friend and the very sensible Pakistani strategic expert Hussain Haqqani who has been active for the last 30 years
 is ank kii aavaran katha main unka lekh padhie, tab yah baat samajh main aegi ki main kyon nahin is daleel ko maananaa chahta ki yah bhavishya ko badalane vaala koi nirnaayak mode sabit hoga
 The Pakistani power establishment is associated with the Islamic ideology of nation-building and has now surpassed even its leaders
 isaki jaden us daraavne asuraksha-bodh or andeh main hai, jo pakistan main dikhataa he
 If Pakistan is redefined since the mid-fifties, then it will have to replace some kind of conviction in place of permanent hostility against India
 phir aap jamini yatharth kii tulana kareh bharat kii arthvyavastha kaa aakaar, fouj, uske samaaj kii takat or sthirataa ko dekhen
 a direct and strategic military mind comes here and creates an asymmetry between the two
 jaahir he, isse ladgaye kaa or kya tarika ho sivaae iske ki ek visham jang ched di jaae
 In the same way, anti-india jihadis increase the strength of Pakistan and become its strategic force
 mujhe yah kehete hue khed ho rahaa he ki isamen badlaav nahin aane vaala he
 The only way to reverse this is to persuade the Pakistani public to accept the fact that the threat posed by India to its existence has been brought to bear, is a pessimistic and suicidal myth aimed only at its military Its dominance has to be maintained in the power structure there
 yah unki arthvyavastha kii upeksha karata he or unhen duniya bhar ke liye sirdard bana detaa he
 Instead, it could become a model for modern democracy with the largest Muslim population and the rest of the Islamic world
 indonesia us manzil par bahut pehle pahunch chukaa he or ab bangladesh udhar daud laga rahaa he
 Pakistan itself is caught in its own curse
 iraq or afghanistan par to akraman hue or philistiniyon kii to jameen hi chin lee gai, phir bhi duniya ke sabase zyada gussell musalmaan pakistan main rahete hai
 This is the reason why he remains the second biggest victim of terrorism today, and all this terrorism is brought up in the house

 Madeleine Albright had once made Pakistan her trademark as a global headache and Bill Clinton pointed his finger at Islamabad, saying that the map of the subcontinent would no longer be painted with blood

 As US Secretary of State, his warning that you cannot keep your backyard snakes in the hope that they will just bite your neighbors, was repeated after the Peshawar incident

 ramajaan main sizafire kitna safal, kitna nahin?sarkaar kii ore se koshish thi ki aatankiyon ke khilaaf sainya oparation ke dauraan jo nagarikon ko pareshaani hoti he wo naa ho
 Hence the ceasefire was implemented
 lekin aatankiyon kaa is par koi asar nahin hua tha, sijafire ke pehle hi din aatankiyon ne mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ke ghar ke paas hi police tukdi par hamalaa kiya tha
 Apart from this, the terrorists attacked the police and army units everywhere throughout the month
 inamen kai javaanon ne apni jaan bhi gavaayin to kai jawan ghayal hue
 What was the government's announcement? Let me tell you that the central government had announced that the operation will not be conducted against the terrorists in the month of Ramadan

 air india ke karmchaaree ko pite jane ke baad air india dwaara shivasena ke saansad rabindra gaekwad par bain lagane or mukadmaa darj hone ke maamle par ab raajnneeti garma gai he
 Today, despite the Shiv Sena uproar over its demands in Parliament, the party is still taking an aggressive stance
 party saansad sanjay raut ne guuruuvaar ko media se kaha ki 'is maamle main asli gunahagaar air india he, jisaki vajah se yah ho rahaa he or anya sabhi airline companiyon ne saansad ko target kiya
 Why they were targeted, under whose pressure and who is behind it, will also be exposed soon
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki 'air india main jo haadasa hua, vah kya or kaise hua, is bare main aaj hamaare saansad rabindra gaekwad ne loksabhaa main puri kahani bataai
 What Gaikwad said is true '
 unhone kaha ki kya yah yatri (rabindra gaekwad) aatankwaadi he? kya is yatri ne bahut bada gunaah kiya he? aaj bahut se saansadon par hatya se lekar anya sangeen aparaadhon main mukademe darj hai
 
 
 So won't everyone be allowed to board the plane? or yah tay karne vaali vimaan companiyaan koun hai
 If the owners of these airlines are investigated, one of them is accused of directly colluding with the underworld don Dawood Ibrahim
 party saansad ne aage kaha ki inhen airline companiyon ne vijay maalya ko apni flite se desh se bhagaaya
 He did not fly himself, did he? You drive the person who looted the country
 unka kahana tha ki 'dilli police is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The law will do its job
 ab tak sach saamne nahin aayaa ki kisne kiya or kya kiya
 You will not allow them to board a flight by placing a direct ban on an MP
 yah ninsaphi he
 For almost 8 days, we have been raising this issue with the government, the minister and in Parliament, but when we felt that despite doing all this, when nothing is happening under any pressure, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray in a meeting Told you then that you are okay, attack the Shiv Sena for justice
 main maanata hum ki yah anyaay he or hamen sansad main yah mudda uthaaya, jisase sansad kaarywahi main baadha utpann hui'
 The comments unhone sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki 'aapaki flite se bade-bade gunahagaar, desh todane vaale kashmir ke algaavvaadi, pakistan se aane vaale kalakaar to ud sakate hai, lekin rabindra gaekwad udaan nahin bhar sakate
 
 lihaaja, aaj hamane aawaaj uthaai or sarkaar kii taraf se aashwast kiya gaya ki is puure maamle par jald hi hal nikaala jayega'
 He warned that if the matter is not resolved by April 10, we (shiv Sena) will not attend the NDA meeting and i am saying after talking to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray
 yah meraa nahin party chif kaa hi bayaan he
 Party MP Sanjay Raut told the media on Thursday that 'the real culprit in this case is Air India, due to which it is happening and all other airline companies targeted the MP
 unhen kyon target kiya, kiske dabaav main target kiya or iske peeche koun he, uskaa bhi jaldi pardaafash ho jayega
 Sanjay Raut said that 'our MP Ravindra Gaikwad told the whole story in Lok Sabha about what happened in Air India, what happened and how it happened
 gaekwad ne jo kaha vah sachai he'
 He said, is this passenger (ravindra Gaikwad) a terrorist? Has this passenger committed a big crime? Today, many mps have cases ranging from murder to other serious crimes
 
 
 to kya sabhi ko vimaan main chadhane nahin diya jayega
 And decide who the airline companies are
 in sabhi airlines ke maalikon kii agar jaanch kii jaae to inamen ek par anderworld don daud ibrahim ke saath sidhe-sidhe santhganth karne kaa aarope he
 The party MP further said that these airline companies drove Vijay Mallya out of the country with his flight
 vah apane aap ko udakar nahin gaye naa? desh ko luutane vaale ko aap bhagaate ho
 He said that 'delhi Police is investigating this matter
 kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 So far the truth has not been revealed who did what and what they did
 ek saansad ke upar aap sidhaa bain lagaakar unhen flite main nahin chadhane denge
 This is unfair
 lagbhag 8 din se ham sarkaar, mantri ke paas or sansad main yah mudda uthaa rahe hai, lekin jab hamen laga ki yah sab karne ke baavjood bhi jab kisi dabaav main kuch nahin ho rahaa he to shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne ek baithak main ham sabhi se kaha ki phir thik he, aap nyaay ke liye shivasena kaa akraman kar dijie
 i believe that this is an injustice and we have raised this issue in Parliament, which has hampered Parliament proceedings'
 tippaniyan He raised the question that 'your flight can fly big criminals, separatists from Kashmir who broke the country, artists coming from Pakistan, but Ravindra Gaikwad cannot fly
 
 Therefore, today we raised our voice and it was assured from the government that this entire matter will be resolved soon
 unhone chetavanee dete hue kaha ki agar 10 april tak yah maamla nahin sulajhaa to ham (shivasena) endie kii meeting main nahin jaaenge or main shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare se baat karne ke baad kah rahaa hum
 This is not the statement of the party chief

 Narendra Modi made the swearing-in ceremony a source of message to the nation
 unhone isse kai tarah ke sandesh die
 The biggest message he gave by creating a compact cabinet is that he does not believe in very big government staff or frills
 unki soch sidhi si yah he ki bada mantrimandal utana prabhavi nahin hota jitna ek ksaa hua or samarpit rajanetaaon kaa samooh
 There were 70 ministers in the UPA government and we saw their work and now we will see the work of 45 ministers
 naukarshahi bharat kii sabase badi samasya he
 In the labyrinth of secretariats, files are lost or left on waiting lists, and many are put on hold
 is naukarshahi ko kasne ke liye samarpit mantri chahie hote hai na ki bahut saare mantri
 Narendra Modi has made this a big effort
 apane vishwasaneey sahyogiyon ko unhone mahatvapurn vibhaag dekar yah tay kar diya he ki aane vaale samay main unhen kisi tarah kaa virodhabhas nahin jhelana padegaa yani unke sahyogiyon kii raay vahi hogi jo unki hogi
 This kind of coordination was rarely seen in the UPA government
 narendra ne kai mahatvapurn mantralayon ko swatantra prabhaar ke rajya mantriyon ke hawaale to kiya he lekin unki manshaa saaf he ki ve khud inke kaam kaaj kii pragati kaa muyna karte rahenge
 Apart from petroleum and gas, there is also the Ministry of Power and Commerce which is very important and it is obvious that the Prime Minister will keep an eye on his progress as these are the ministries directly connected with the progress of the country
 ek or baat he ki unhone is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa ki bahut buudhe netaa mantrimandal main na hon or kam umr ke logon ko sahi pratinidhitiv mili
 During the election campaign, Narendra Modi had consistently rejected dynastic politics in politics by constantly addressing Rahul Gandhi with the word "shahzade"

 Nowadays Baba's name does not come on the tongue that just weird pictures get caught in the mind
 ab karen bhi kya
 His Baba people are doing such activities that the feeling of devotion was due to awakening
 tabhi to kareeb darjan bhar baba jail yatra par hai
 Now this upmarket Baba also got his name added to the same group of Babas
 samandar main ladakiyon ke saath nahaane ke shaukeen in sabase taaja baba par bhi rape kaa hi iljaam he
 The era has changed nowadays when the babas used to have a special huliya or chola and with whom they were identified
 ab aaj ke baba apmarket or aptudet ho chuke hai
 It is difficult to identify whether he is a Baba, Majnu, a rapist, a blackmailer or a merchant? satsang sunaayenge to sirf mahilaon ko, mannath puri karenge to bas ladakiyon kii, par manachaaha fal paane kii shart he inaki videsh nahin to desh main saath ghumo
 They are the newest, most modern, most upmarket Baba in the nation of all the big and small, good and bad, in and out of jail
 in aadarneey baba kaa naam he bhagwaan rajnish grover urf ashok plaiwale
 Before becoming Lord, his ply shop was in Delhi
 dilli kii dukaan nahin chali to dharm kii dukaan khol lee
 Babine Baba, who is running from the police, also fed him that instead of his satsang, today we have to speak about him in this incident
 asaram, narayan sai, ichhadhari baba, nagin dance vaale baba ke baad ab inaki baari he
 Rape charges of eating jail air
 haalanki baba philhal satsang samet sari moh-maaya or apni bhakton ko chhod kar bhaage hue hai
 But how long will it run? If only God
 der-saver hi sahi police ko inke darshan to jarur honge
 What praise should you give to these Baba? dilli ke ek chote se dukandaar the kabhi
 There were ply shops
 sadiyaan bhi bechin
 Then one day suddenly became God
 mannaton ke naam par apni hasarat nikaalane lage
 The hobby was big, so he also chose a big place for satsang
 ye desh ke shaayad pehle baba honge jo satsang sirf apane farmahouse main karte the
 These good days of Baba descended on the waves of the sea after riding the satsang business in the farm house
 pehle inkaa haal kharaab tha
 The business was not running, so Ashok Kumar thought why not do any other business
 tabhi use laga ki ek dharm kaa hi aisa dhandha he, jisamen bina puunji lagaae kamai hi kamai he
 What was it then Ashok Kumar took a farm house in Chhatarpur and set up a religion shop
 dukaan ke udghaatan se pehle usne khud ke bare main ye elaan karvaa diya ki wo bhagwaan kaa rup he or jise chaahe use naa sirf manachaaha fal de saktaa he balki uski sari mannath bhi puri kar saktaa he
 There is no shortage of people of blind faith anyway
 lihaaja trick kaam kar gaya
 Baba's satsang hit on sight kiya mahilaon kaa shoshanbaba sirf somvaar ko satsang karte
 And Baba's people used to take care that less men are better in satsang
 mahilaon or ladakiyon main baba kii khaas dilchaspee thi
 Especially rich women and girls who have no husband or father or live separately
 ek baar dukaan chal padi to baba ke bhakt bhi banate gaye
 Now in the name of fulfilling the vow, Baba went down on the exploitation of women and girls
 prasad ke naam par biscuit or santara main baba nashili cheez mila dete phir hosh kho chuki mahilaon or ladakiyon kii aabru se khelte
 Not only that, he would also take pictures of her and then blackmail her
 maa-beti ke saath jabardasteebaba kii aisi hi ek mahila bhakt jaipur main rahati thi
 When the shop was inaugurated, he summoned Baba to Jaipur
 baba usee ke ghar main ruke
 But during the stay at home, Baba first forced her with the woman and then later with her daughter
 itnaa hi nahin un donon kaa video bhi bana liya
 Then he started blackening them
 par beti ne himmat dikhaai or usne kisi tarah baba ke samandar snaan kaa yaa video baba ke mobile se lekar police ke paas ja pahunchi or sari kahani suna di
 After this, a rape case was registered against Baba at Jawahar Circle police station in Jaipur
 police ko shaq he ki baba ne isi tarah blackmel kar bahut si or auraton or ladakiyon ko bhi apana nishaanaa banaaya he
 At present, the Jaipur police has left for Delhi to nab Baba
 haalanki khabar ye bhi aa rahi he ki khud kaa bhanda footne ke baad se baba malaysia nikal bhaagane kii firaaq main he
