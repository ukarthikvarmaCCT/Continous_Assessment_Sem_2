 ) In a meeting of the BJP Parliamentary Party on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that senior ministers have been asked by the party mps from time to time to get feedback on the functioning of the government and what the people think about the government and to give feedback to the mps
 Have said piem modi ne ye jimmedaari jin 6 varisht mantriyo ko di he
 The ministers who will hold the responsibility include External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar, Urban Development Minister m Venkaiah Naidu and Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, who will meet all mps
 piem modi ne party saansadon se saaf-saaf kaha ki ye 6 varisht mantri unase charchaa karte rahenge
 PM Modi has also decided the way to meet
 mantri jis rajya se hai use chhod kar duusare rajyon ke saansadon se unki lunch yaa chaay par teen se chaar ghante mulaakaat karenge
 Modi said the most important thing to his mps is that he can openly say his words to them
 sabhi 6 varisht mantri saansdo ke feedback kii alag alag report taiyaar karne ke baad ko report kii piem, amit shah saunpa karenge
 Sources say that PM Modi believes that every positive or negative thing related to the government does not reach him
 isliye piem modi kaa maananaa he ki agar saansad apane varisht mantriyon se dil kholkar charchaa karenge to sarkaar kii nitiyon, yojanaon or kaaryakramon ke bare main fere feedback milegaa
 Many BJP mps say that now they can give the right feedback about their talk and government without fear
 sarkaar banane ke baad kai bijepi saansdo ne piem modi se to nahin lekin party adhyaksh amit shah, sanghathan mahaamantri raamalaal or aresas ke netaaon se mantriyon kii mulaakaat ke liye samay nahin dene kii shikaayat karte rahe hai
 In the meeting of BJP Parliamentary Party last year, MP from Ballia in UP, Bharat Singh had said in the presence of PM that the minister does not even give his phone to the mps of his own party, even if they give him an appointment
 bharat singh ne aage kaha tha ki ye sarkaar ke liye khatre kii ghanti he
 The schemes will be successful with the feedback
 PM Modi is well aware that the policies and plans his government has planned in the last two years will now have to be reformed based on the feedback from the public, otherwise the results of all the policies and schemes of the government from next year Will start showing piem modi ko jaanane vaale hameshaa ek baat kehete he kii unka har kaam karne kaa tarika sabase alag hota he
 In his government, future strategy is made on the feedback of the public
 piem maananaa he agar janata kaa feedback sahi mil jaae to koi bhi yojana or sarkaar ke kaarykram fail nahin ho sakate hai
 One thing is clear that if this feedback program is messed up anywhere, then not only Modi but also BJP mps will have to suffer
 ye baat pradhanmantri modi achche se jaanate hai ki jis gati se sarkaar ke do saal biit gaye he usase bhi kai guna teji se agle teen saal dekhte-dekhte nikal jaaenge

 rajasthan ke dausa jile main jevarata kalam gaanv ke ek sthaneey rasukhdaar siyaasi parivaar main byaahi gai yah 24 varshiya mahila khud ko raajnneeti se dur rakhe hui thi
 His focus was on completing his BA from a local college
 lekin ab ve 4,500 votaron vaale is gaanv kii sarpanch ban sakati hai
 He is likely to win this general seat as easily as his Jethani Bina Devi
 29 varshiya binaa 2010 main sarpanch kaa chunaav jiti thim, par is baar ve chunaav nahin lard rahi hai
 According to the local whisper, Bina has not even studied till eighth
 vaise unka kahana he ki ve isliye chunaav nahin lard rahi hai kyonki unke pati di
 R
 bairava dausa se pradhan kii ladaai main hai
 The discussion of Bina's lack of educational qualifications can be believed to some extent, but all this is due to a controversial ordinance issued by the Vasundhara Raje government on 19 December
 rajasthan panchayat raaj (doosraa sanshodhan)adhyadesh, 2014 ke jariye janvari or farvari main hone vaale sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaavon main panch ke padon ko chhodkar anya sabhi padon ke liye sabhi ummidavaaron kii ek nunatam shaikshanik yogyata nirdhaarit kar di gai he
 The ordinance has made education up to 8th for candidates like Bina and Kamlesh to contest elections on 9,900 posts of sarpanch in the state
 adhishuchet kshetron main 1,200 siton par chunaav ladgaye waalon ke liye isamen chhot dete hue paanchavin paas hona anivaary kiya gaya he
 The minimum educational qualification for those who have contested election of Panchayat Samiti members, Pradhans, Zilla Parishad members and district heads has been kept in 10th standard
 sarkaar ke is faisle par kaaphi vivaad ho rahaa he
 The ruling BJP government is claiming this to be a progressive step, claiming that it will encourage people
 khaskar gramin ilaakon ke liye ki vahaan ke log schuli padhai puri karen
 On the other hand, Congress and various social organizations have called it an arbitrary move
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki vidhansabha or sansad ke chunaavon tak main kisi tarah kii nunatam shaikshanik yogyata kii shart nahin rakhi gai he
 State Congress President Sachin Pilot says, "with the new law, 70 per cent of the existing Panchayat Samiti members and 55 per cent Zila Parishad members will not be able to meet the conditions
" '' saamaajik sanghathanon ne varisht vakil indira jaisingh ke jariye adhyadesh ke khilaaf rajasthan hycourt main ek janhit yachika daayar karwaai thi lekin adaalat ne chunaav par roak lagane se inkaar kar diya
 Former chief Kishan Lal Bairwa, who lives in Dausa, the pilot's home, just an hour away from the noise of Jaipur, calls it a tremendous decision
 ve binaa or kamalesh ke shvasur hai
 Says Bairava, who has studied till 10th, "the condition of minimum educational qualification will trim the candidates who stand without thought and the ruckus will be reduced
" shikshit hone se vyakti ko jimmedaari kaa ehsaas hota he
 He also contested assembly elections twice on Congress ticket, but lost
 to kya yah congress kaa aadhaar maane jane vaale gramin rajasthan main bijepi kaa aadhaar badhaane ke liye raaje kaa game-changer yaa chaalaak prayaas he? kuch had tak donon hi baaten sahi hai
 During a meeting between Raje, Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria and BJP state president Ashok Parnami, a decision was taken suddenly to bring such an ordinance
 satta main rahane ke dauraan congress khud is tarah ke vichaar main dilchaspee dikhaa rahi thi
 But because of this controversy, the idea was abandoned that it would be discriminatory to impose such a condition on those contesting the election of sarpanch and keeping mps, mlas free from it
 payalat ne india today se kaha, ''main bhi chahta hum ki padhe-likhe log chunakar padon par aaen, lekin main ise charanbaddh tareeke se karata
 Those who want to contest elections would have given enough time for them to attain minimum educational qualification
 '' unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne vidhansabha ke saamne is sanshodhan ko bahes ke liye pesh karne kii himmat nahin dikhaai kyonki use gaanvon main iskaa vipareet asar hone kaa dar tha
 At the same time, BJP speculated that even if there is little opposition, it will be limited to a very small section of the voters and whether it is Congress or BJP, most of the contenders for the civic elections will support it
 is adhyadesh ke jariye bijepi sarkaar khud ko pragatisheel sabit karnaa chaahati he, jo nae or shikshit chehron ko jagah de rahi he or chunavi daud main congress ko chakit bhi karnaa chaahati thi
 Says Parnami, "I have not heard a single BJP ticket claimant complain of this ordinance

 Krishna Kunal, collector of Jaipur, says both decisions were meant to encourage

 The condition of minimum educational qualification will reduce the dropout rate
 '' ab shiksha vibhaag ek nayaa naaraa oochaal rahaa he-'sarpanch hona he to skool puraa karnaa hoga

 yahaan ham da line king ke hindi varjan kii baat kar rahe hai to laazmi he film main bahut si baaten bilkul alag thim
 You know the story of the film, the king of the forest Mufasa protects everyone and maintains peace and happiness
 unka bhai skaar unase jalataa he or rajgaddi paanaa chahta he
 Mufasa's son Simba is the rightful owner of the throne and he will grow up to be a king
 mufasa or simba kaa rishta bahut gaharaa he or ye donon baap-bete ek duusare se behad pyaar karte hai
 In an accident, Mufasa's death snatches everything from Simba, now how will he progress in life, it remains to be seen
 is film kii charchaa kaaphi samay se ho rahi thi or phans ko mufasa ke rup main shahrukh khan or simba ke rup main unke bete aryan khan kii aawaaj sunne kaa besabri se intjaar tha
 You will be happy to know that both of these are unmatched in the film
 tiger main mufasa ke role main shahrukh khan kii aawaaj sunakar kai logon ko shaq tha ki shaayad unki aawaaj is kirdaar ke liye thik naa baithe, lekin aisa bilkul nahin he
 Shahrukh Khan's voice has been given depth to suit this role which suits Mufasa
 iske alaava aryan khan kii aawaaj tiger main jahaan saim tu saim shahrukh jaisi lag rahi thi vahiin film main unase kaaphi alag he
 Not only this, you will love Aryan's work because he has given a good voice over
 shahrukh or aryan ke alaava film main jaju ke kirdaar ke liye asraani, timon ke kirdaar ke liye shreyas talapade, pumba ke kirdaar ke liye sanjay mishra or skaar ke kirdaar ke liye ashish vidhyaarthee ne apni aawaaj di he or in sabhi kaa kaam bemisaal he
 Especially, Ashish gets praised for the student because the way he has given life to Scar's character is amazing
 kaisaa he film kaa diarectiondiarection kii baat karen to jon feverou ne is film ko khubsuurati se banaaya he
 This film is like an animated version to watch, just adds its beauty to its real world and gives you different kind of happiness
 film ke vijuals kamaal hai or editing kaaphi crisp he
 The entire forest, home of Teemon and Pumba, Kali Ghati is all the same and takes you back to the times of your childhood when you watched Simba on TV
 haalanki film main kuch kamiyaan jarur hai
 The first half of the film may make you feel a bit slow
 iske alaava hindi gaanon kii baat karen to aapako unhen sunakar bilkul majaa nahin aayega
 Singers Armaan Malik and Sunidhi Chauhan have done a good job, but the songs of this film do not have that
 iskaa hindi soundtrack kaaphi niraashajanak he
 Apart from Hakuna Matata, you do not even remember the lyrics of other songs
 kul milakar ye ek badhiya film he
 Shahrukh Khan and Aryan Khan will definitely make your heart happy after seeing this film
 bacchon ke enjoy karne ke liye ye hameshaa se parfect film rahi he
 So if you have a mind this weekend, then give a chance to The Lion King

 jabaki congress ke varisht netaaon ke mutabik, arthshaastri or anbhavi manmohan singh kii sansad main jarurat he, isliye party chaahegi ki wo jald se jald sansad main vaapasi karen
 But the problem is that in the places where the Rajya Sabha elections are held, the Congress does not have the required numbers

 - peedita, parijan or khun ke rishtedaar hi exiaar darj kara sakate hai
 - The magistrate shall have the right to maintain the marriage by making an agreement between the husband and wife
 - ek baar main teen talaak bill kii peedit mahila muaavje kii adhikarkanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha kitin talaak bilmen ye sanshodhan zaruri the
 Therefore, the cabinet has approved these amendments
 ravishankar prasad ne bhi bataaya ki 2017 main teen talaak ke kul 389 cese saamne aaye or 160 cese supreme court se faisla aane ke baad saamne aae hai
 Today it will be the effort of the Modi government to pass the triple talaq bill in the Rajya Sabha with new amendments and pass it from the Lok Sabha today to make it a law
 pichley satr main vipaksh ne kuch kamiyaan bataate hue bill ko select cameti bhejne kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 The government did not consider it
 jiske baad ye bill hangaame kii bhent chadh gaya tha
 According to PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah's strategy to surround the Congress on triple talaq, if the Congress supports this bill, then their Muslim vote bank will have 100 percent impact
 agar congress ek baar phir bill kaa virodh karti he to bijepi puure desh main ye sandesh dene kii koshish karegi ki congress teen talaak kii peedit mahilaon kaa saath sirf vot bank politics ke chalate nahin kar rahi he
 The way Ravi Shankar Prasad has asked Sonia Gandhi the question whether the Muslims will stand up for the support of this bill to honor women? This means that if the triple talaq bill is not passed in this session of Parliament, then the government will blame the Congress for it
 piem modi or amit shah ne teen talaak ko lekar jis tarah kii ranneeti banaai he usko dekhakar to lagata he ki aane vaale madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh vidhansabha chunaav or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main teen talaaq bill kaa faaydaa unhen milegaa or iskaa sidhaa nuksaan congress ko hoga
 In Uttar Pradesh, people suffering from severe power crisis may have a grudge against the people of Kannauj, the parliamentary constituency of SP Chief Mulayam Singh Yadav's home district Etawah, his parliamentary constituency Mainpuri and wife of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 kaaran ki yah saare kshetra vidyut katautee se puri tarah mukt hai
 In a written reply from the Chief Minister to a question of BJP member Suresh Kumar Khanna in the Assembly, it was said, "reduced power supply has been ordered to Taj Tripazium area Agra and Etawah, Mainpuri and Kannauj
 ’is prashn par ki ukt jilon ko kis aadhaar par bijli katautee se mukt rakhaa gaya he, yadav ne kaha he ki yah faisla ‘yatha aavashyaktaa’ ke aadhaar par liya gaya he
 In another answer from the Chief Minister on a question of Congress member Anugraha Narayan Singh, it has been told that till March, total 11268 on domestic and industrial consumers in the state
 53 karod rupee kaa bijli bill bakaayaa he
 Yadav has told that Allahabad has the highest number of defaulters of more than five lakh rupees, where the number is 787 while Kanpur is second with 166

 For the next month's World Cup cricket in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, some players have been selected in some teams who have been related to India at some time and the number of such cricketers is so much that they combined to form a separate team
 May go
 bharat ke alaava vishwa cap main bhaag le rahi 13 anya tiimon main se chaar timen aisi hai jinamein bhartiya mul ke khilaadiyon ko bhi jagah mili he
 It is also a coincidence that the team consisting of these players will also be balanced to a great extent as it will be a good mix of experience and youth and will also have spinners ranging from top batsmen to fast bowlers and sub-continent pitches
 bhartiya mul ke khilaadiyon kii is team main canada kaa pratinidhitiv sabase adhik hoga kyonki uski 15 sadasyeey team main saat khilaadiyon kaa sidhe bharat se naata judaa he
 Six of these players were born in India
 is team main westeindies ke shivnarayan chandrapal or ramanaresh sarwan jaise anbhavi jabaki dakshin africa ke hashim amala ke rup main behtareen ballebaaj shaamil honge
 Among these players is a captain in the form of Ashish Bagai, who will lead Canada in the Cricket Mahakumbh from 19 February to 2 April
 anubhav ke aadhaar par chandrapal ko captaini kaa daayitv saunpa ja saktaa he lekin wicketcaping kii jimmedaari 26 janvari (ganatantr diwasah 1982) ko dilli main janmen bagai hi sanbhaalenge
 By the way, Heral Patel and 16-year-old Nitish Kumar alias Ronnie are also in the Canadian team
 hiraal kaa janm ahmedabad main hua tha
 Bagai has also been playing the role of opener but his favorite place is number three
 madhyakram kii jimmedaari 261 van de main 8648 ran banane vaale chandrapal or 156 van de match main 5098 ran banane vaale sarwan sanbhaalenge
 In such a situation, Rakep Patel, who scored 320 runs in 23 matches for Kenya, can be promoted to bat at number six while Jimmy Hansra, who is included in the Canadian team as an all-rounder, can bat at number seven
 hansra kaa janm 29 disambar 1984 ko ludhiana main hua tha
 The attack of this team will definitely be led by Ravi Rampal of West Indies who has experience of playing 50 odis
 unke saath nayi gend kaa jimmaa chandigarh main janmen canadai madhyam gati ke gendbaaj harveer singh badhwaan sanbhaalenge
 The team will also have leg break googly bowler Balaji Rao who has a good experience of playing on Indian pitches
 is teraa sadasyeey team main canada ke hi parth desai ke rup main ek anya spinner ko rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The left-arm spinner was born in Navsari, Gujarat and his memorable moment in cricket is Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team's 2007 World Twenty20 Championship win
 sachin tendulkar ko vah apana hero maanate hai or vishwa cap ke dauraan master blaster se milane kii ichha rakhte hai
 In such a situation, Canada's Hiral Patel may have to play the 12th player
 vishwa cap main bhaag le rahe pravasi bharatiyon kii team kuch is prakaar se hogi- shivnarayan chandrapal (captain), hashim amala, tanmay mishra, ashish bagai (up captain or wicketiper), ramanaresh sarwan, rakep patel, jimmy hansra, ravi rampal, harveer singh badhwaan, balaji raav, parth desai, hiraal patel or niteesha kumaar
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will start the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on Thursday

 Interestingly, Kejriwal will start his cleanliness drive from the Prime Minister's residence located on Race Course Road

 The interesting fact is that the Aam Aadmi Party had announced the sweep of the party's election symbol from this Valmiki House
 valmiki samudaay ko 'aap' kaa majboot samarthak mana jaataa he
 Kejriwal said about the cleanliness drive, that it should not only be symbolic and the officials should work for the betterment of the cleaning workers

 CM Arvind Kejriwal of Delhi has approved the 'mukhyamantri Teerth Yatra Yojana' for senior citizens of the national capital
 isse pehle is yojana ko lekar up rajyapal anil baijal ne dilli sarkaar ko hidaayat di thi or dobaaraa vichaar karne ko kaha tha
 After the Supreme Court's decision, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal cleared the scheme, ignoring the objections raised by the Lieutenant Governor
 is yojana kaa laabh dilli main rahane vaale 60 saal se zyada kii umr ke naagarik uthaa sakenge
 Under this, the Delhi government will provide free pilgrimage to 77 thousand senior citizens every year
 dilli sarkaar ne is tirth yatra yojana ke liye paanch root tay kiye the, jinamein mathura-vrundavan, haridwar-rishikesh-nilkanth, pushkar-ajmer, amritsar-bagha-anandpur sahib or vaishno devi-jammu shaamil hai
 Pilgrims will be sent to these fixed religious places on a three-day and two-night journey
 dilli ke rajasav mantri kailash gahalot ne yojana kii ghoshnaa karte hue kaha ki dilli cabinet ne is skim ko aath janvari 2018 ko hi manjuuri de di thi, lekin up rajyapal kii taraf se is par kuch objeshan laga die gaye the
 Because of this it could not be implemented till now
 mukhyamantri tirth yatra yojana ke tahat har vidhansabha se har saal 1100 yatriyon ko vibhinn tirthon kii yatra karai jaaegi
 The government has laid down some conditions for this scheme, according to which senior citizens traveling should be residents of Delhi
 uski umr 60 saal se zyada honi chahie
 Senior citizens traveling will also be able to take a colleague above 18 years of age, whose entire cost will also be borne by the government
 haalanki sarkari adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ko is yojana kaa laabh nahin milegaa
 To avoid irregularities, the government has made another provision, under which the person availing the scheme will have to tell by self-certification that he has given all the correct information and he has not availed the scheme before
 tirthayatra par jane vaale nagarikon kodilli sarkaarek lakh kaa beemaa bhi degi
 The government will make arrangements for travel and lodging
 yatra par jane vaale nagarikon kaa chayan sarkaar online aavednon ke jariye karegi, jo diviginal kamishnar ke daftar yaa ilaake ke vidhayak ke daftar se milenge
 Every year 77 thousand senior citizens will be selected from Delhi through lottery and mlas have to certify that the concerned senior citizens are from their area
 kejariwal dvaaratirthayatraaki is yojana ko saal 2019 ke aam chunaavon se jodakar bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 It is being said that Kejriwal is preparing to do the Hindu vote bank in his favor through this scheme
 in 10 point main samajhie puri yojana1
 Must be a citizen of Delhi

 Diandra will fulfill Dimpy's wish and free Puneet from jail
 karishma diyandra se kahati hai ki unhone unka naam na lekar dimpi kaa naam kyon liya
 Bigg Boss 8: Gauhar's sister Nigar Khandiyandra, who will enter the house, will say that Karishma had said two wishes, either to free Puneet or to have her mother talk
 diyandra bataaengi ki karishma punit ko aaazaad karaane se zyada apni maa se baat karnaa chaahati thim
 Whereas Dimpy had only one wish
 Bigg Boss: sushant hue ghar se baharkarishma apana paksh rakhte hue kahati hai ki yah kahana galata hoga kyonki unhone pehle punit ko aaazaad karne ke liye kaha or diyandra ne unhen galat samajha
 There will be no solution between the two
 lekin yah saaf he ki diyandra ko lekar karishma ke man main kuch-kuch aa gaya he
 Diandra will try to explain how useful this effort will be

 The results of the by-elections have come
 jise modi magic kii pariksha bataaya ja rahaa tha, usamen bijepi khet rahi
 At least this is the decree of the media
 tivi studio main upachunaav par bahes karte kathith export khushiyon ke samandar main utraa rahe hai
 These are the same experts who do not like the politics of the BJP brand
 or ye khule taur par bijepi kii ranneeti main nuktachini nikaal rahe hai
 They are telling how the BJP, which cleans the sweep of the other parties in Uttar Pradesh in the May 2014 elections, lost badly this time
 or apane vishleshan ke utsaah main ye tamaam pole pandit ab bijepi ko bin maangi salaah se bhi navaj rahe hai
 At least this time, there is a similarity of ideas between them
 sabhi bijepi se kah rahe hai ki ise apane ugr hindutv vaali chunavi ranneeti ko taj dena chahie
 They are saying that if the BJP wants to repeat its charisma, it should desist from divisive politics
 in vishleshkon kaa tark he ki bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav vikaas or achche prashasan kaa naaraa dekar ladaa or jeeta
 You don't have to spend a lot of mind to understand that these analysts are blaming falsehoods
 inkaa akalan galatfahami kii jameen par punap rahaa he
 Advice to BJP or first thing, it is very clear that these analysts are not the good thinkers of BJP
 inamen se kuch ek to khud kii khule taur par bijepi virdohi vichaarak ke rup main branding karte hai
 So why would he give any such advice to the BJP, so that his victory will be flagged
 duusari baat, bijepi ne loksabhaa chunaav khalis vikaas or gavarnence ke mudde par nahin jite
 This is a kind of myth, which these pole pundits promoted repeatedly
 bijepi ne bhi kabhi khule taur par iskaa khandan nahin kiya
 In such a situation, it is not understood why these anti-bjp leaders are now advising him to do inclusive politics
 darasal ye chaahate hai ki khaastaur par hindi pattee yaa hindu bahul ilaakon main dharm aadhaarit mudde jor na pakaden
 They want the BJP to be a liberal and all-along political option
 or isi chaahane yaa ichha ke tahat vah chaahate hai ki bijepi unki salaah par chale or apana chola badal le
 They want the BJP to become such a party that they can vote for it
 sattadhari dal kaa daaman tham sakenmgar is soch yaa khwaahish main ek pech he
 The trick is that they will move by advising them all, but the real fight on the field will be fought by the BJP
 or bijepi inke sapanom kii party to banane se rahi
 BJP is the dream party of Narendra Modi
 vah sanghathan ko apni soch ke mutabik dhaal rahe hai
 And Amit Shah is helping them in doing so
 or ye donon hi netaa apane udaar khyaalon ke liye to nahin hi jane jate hai
 When criticized by militant softness, critics of Hamodi want to use their power and influence to silence hate statements such as heroic figures like Yogi Adityanath or Laxmikant Vajpayee
 ye aalochak chaahate hai ki sampradayik sadbhaav bana rahe
 They do not want the BJP to raise the issue of love jihad loudly
 ye chaahate hai ki bijepi secular or pragatisheel ban jaae
 Take the middle path of coordination
 ye chaahate hai ki bijepi congress ban jaae
 So that they can love him
 uski satta kii dhara main shaamil ho saken
 And while doing so, they should not have any kind of regret
 agar magar ke mukhauton ke peeche munh na dhankna pade
 In these analyzes, suddenly the good wishes of Narendra Modi or Amit Shah to be liberals have started appearing
 inhen lag rahaa he ki modi or shah to thik hai, magar gorakhpur ke yogi kattar hai
 He is pushing the agenda of radical Hindutva
 ye vahi udaaravaadi hai, jo kal tak adwani ko udaar or secular or uske banisbat modi ko ugr or sampradayik bataa rahe the
 And even back then, these are the same people who used to call Advani as fanatical than Vajpayee
 ye ek pattern he, jisamen baar baar bataaya jaataa he ki sattadhari dal main udaarvaadiyon kii raajnneetik jameen sikudti ja rahi he or ugr tatv use hadapte ja rahe hai
 And if you talk about UP, BJP achieved smog success in UP
 aisa to nahin tha ki uttar pradesh kii janata achaanak se neend se jaagi or usne vikaas or sushasan kaa daaman thaamne kaa faisla kiya
 If this was the permanent sentiment of the people, then in the 2012 state assembly elections, she would not have accepted the Samajwadi Party's caste-religion formula and handed over the key to power
 hindi pattee ne modi ko singhaasana saunpa kyonki use modi kii aakraamak hindutv or uske upar chadhe vikaas ke mulamme kii kalabaji raas ai
 Modi emerged as a Hindu leader who does not do secular stunting of Fijool
 sapa or congress kii tarah alpsankhyak kalyaan kaa beja raag nahin alaapta
 The middle class focuses on their dreams
 or sabase badi baat nattejey detaa he
 Now, Chanakya is unable to understand why the UP people, who had given such a huge mandate to the BJP a few months ago, suddenly lost their way
 iskaa jawaab ye he ki upachunaavon main janata ko isaki jarurat nahin lagi
 He knew that these elections would not change the state of affairs
 isaki tasdik chunaavon main kam voting persentage bhi karata he
 Look at it
 sthaneey satta ke lagaav ko yaad kariye
 And the puzzle will be solved
 bijepi kaa voter in chunaavon main utane utsaah se nahin niklaa kyonki ye kavayad badlaav ke liye nahin thi
 It was just a lack of engagement in the status quo
 udhar, pradesh main shashan kii kaman sanbhaalane ke baavjood samaajawaadee party haashiye par jaati dikh rahi thi
 So he threw everything into these elections so that his political relevance would remain
 aapkaa gubbaaraa phodne ke liye maafee chahta humbijapi ke aalochakon ko lagata he ki yah dal in chunavi nateezon se sabak legaa
 Will abandon its divisive policies
 apane ravaiye main badlaav laaegaa
 Sadly, they will continue to mash
 loksabhaa chunaavon main modi ugr hindutv ke maharathi banakar ubhare
 He introduced it with packing the development of the Gujarat model
 lekin packing kaa kitna mahatv he
 The real thing is the material inside
 hindutv bijepi kaa sthaayee bhav he
 He is the root of politics
 udaaravaadi kuch bhi khushrahemiyaan paal len, sachai yahi he ki ab is brand kii raajnneeti or tikhi hogi
 Polarization will occur even more quickly
 or iske chunavi nattejey bhi dikhenge
 Probably when he is most needed
 narendra modi, amit shah or yogi adityanath, ye sab ek hi sur main raag alaap rahe hai
 Just sitting in the TV studio, critics are pretending to listen to them differently
 aap india today group digital ke managing editorkamalesh sinhako twitor par bhi follow kar sakate hai
 His Twitter handle is @ KAMLESHKSINGH dakshin vietnam kii ek sadak par nangi bhaagti kim phuk (kim Phuc) kii us tasviir ko koun bhul saktaa he
 Nine-year-old Kim has a few more children running away
 sadak ke antim chor par bam dhamaake ke baad uthaa hua kaale dhuen kaa gubaar he
 This dark truth of the devastation of war would not have been revealed to the world, if the photographer Nick had not dared to take that picture
 nik ne na sirf tasviir lee, balki kim ko uthaakar aspataal bhi le gaye
 Where Kim was treated and she survived
 aaj kim ke do bachche hai or wo toronto main rahati hai
 Kim said on her forties that through this picture, i am hopeful for the world
 is photo ko pulitzer puraskaar mila tha
 Another picture is of Sudan
 bhukh ne ek choti bacchee ko chalane se bhi laachaar bana diya he
 She is lying on the ground and is staring a large vulture at some distance from it
 kevin carter kii yah tasviir jab 1993 main neuyark times main chhapi to duniya bhar main hangaamaa much gaya
 People started asking what happened to that girl
 kya photographer ne use bachaane kaa prayaas kiya
 It is the most controversial topic in the history of journalism, which has many aspects
 is photo ne bhukh kii bhayaavah tasviir puri duniya ke saamne rakh di thi
 Carter also received a Pulitzer Prize for this photo
 ye do alag-alag sthitiyaan hai
 In one situation the photographer helps his character and in the other situation does not help, but both receive the Pulitzer Prize
 donon hi sthitiyon main puri duniya hill jaati he
 For example, Gajendra's suicide at Jantar Mantar has shaken the indifference of the entire country towards farmers' suicide
 sab ke sab expos ho gaye hai
 We were just beginning to consider the government record of suicide of more than two and a half lakh farmers as a paper
 gajendra kii tasveeron ne aatmahatya karne vaale lakhon kisaanon ko puure desh ke saamne zindaa kar diya he
 The two pictures i have mentioned were brought to me by Professor Pradhan of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication at a prime time show
 ham charchaa kar rahe the ki is tarah ke maukey par kisi patrkaar ko kya karnaa chahie
 This is the biggest dilemma of the ethics of our profession
 iskaa koi ek nishchit uttar nahin ho saktaa he
 a journalist is a human being before a reporter or a photographer, but it is also his job to keep recording the photograph of the occasion in a way that can be useful for humanity
 kai prakaar kii sthiti ho sakati he
 The situation will decide what the journalist will do, not a book
 jantar-mantar par aam aadmi party kii kisaan raily main gajendra singh ne sabake saamne aatmahatya kar lee
 He was not in the middle of any memory or in any flood or under any bridge or he was not on the roof of a multi-storied building or he did not fall under the moving train at all
 vah pehle se ped par baitha tha, jise utaarne kii apil bhi hui
 Which was seen by hundreds of people present from the camera
 police ne bhi dekha, jiske paas zaruri saadhan hone chahie, khaskar tab, jab mukhyamantri kii sabha ho rahi ho
 As a precaution, there should be a train from fire brigade to ambulance
 ab yah dilli sarkaar ko bataanaa chahie ki ambulance police bhejegi yaa sarkari aspataal kaa kaam he
 Did the Chief Minister's Office ask all these questions regarding the arrangement of the rally
 media main yah to khabar ai thi ki police se kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri ko patrakaron se dur rakhaa jaae
 i cannot confirm this, but at any rally, there is a level of dialogue between the party and the police
 aamane-saamne kii baithak bhi hoti he
 It is now being debated that the media standing there should have tried to save Gajendra's life
 main jantar-mantar par nahin tha or na hi vahaan maujuud kisi patrkaar se baat hui he
 Yet this debate is telling how serious people are about the behavior of journalists on the occasion
 vahaan manch par baithe rajanetaaon ne bachaane ke liye awaz to lagaai, magar daud nahin lagaai
 He also had a mike, gave a call to the police, but the police did not field Gajendra
 vahaan khadey saikadon patrakaron ko kya karnaa chahie tha
 What should be done if everyone or any one is seen in their camera that a man is putting a noose
 kya pataa, kisi patrkaar ne awaz lagaai bhi ho, yaa kya pataa, kisi ne parvaah hi nahin kii ho
 The answer is not so simple
 ham yah sawaal poochne se pehle zarur dekhen ki sthiti kya he
 What to do if a photographer is taking a picture from a bridge
 tairnaa nahin aata he, phir bhi dub jaae yaa tairnaa aata bhi he to tej dhara main kud jaae
 i am not sure how many journalists standing there would have climbed the tree, but this is an important question
 agar kisi jhonpadi main aag lagi he to photographer ko kya karnaa chahie
 Should he jump into the hut like Rajendra Kumar and bring the child up
 bahut mushkil he yah sab kahana, kyonki patrkaar sakasham he yaa nahin, yah ek sawaal to he
 The job of a journalist must be that while reporting, he would alert all agencies
 tippaniyan But it should not happen that when we get tired of asking the leaders, police and people, then we start asking the press instead
 is sthiti main main itnaa hi kah saktaa hum ki jantar-mantar par koi asaadhaaran sthiti nahin thi
 People could be alerted even without taking the risk of climbing the tree
 agar kisi ne apane camere se aisa hote hue dekha he, to use hangaamaa karnaa chahie tha
 It should have caught the attention of the rest of the press colleagues and created a disruption there by stopping the recording, so that everyone could be ready to save Gajendra's life
 sabaki naakaami main press kii bhi naakaami he, lekin iske liye yah tathyaatmak rup se jaananaa hoga ki kya vaaki vahaan kisi ne kisi ko alert nahin kiya
 i was not there, so cannot say with the claim
 agar aap yah kahen ki press ne jis tarah se reporting kii, kya vah uchit tha, to iske nishchit jawaab die ja sakate hai or javabdehi tay kii ja sakati he
 Gajendra is no longer on that tree, but that tree is still alive for the cameras, standing under it, the reporters are still pretending on the order of the news room that this is the tree that Gajendra was hanging from a branch
 
 yahi vah ped he, jise manch par baithe netaa dekhte rahe
 One day, our channel will make the tree guilty
 yahi vah ped he, jisane gazendra ko latakane diya
 This is the tree that killed Gajendra
 mat bhuuliega ki ham pipli live ke daur main ji rahe hai
 Who can forget that picture of Kim Phuc running naked on a street in South Vietnam
 nau saal kii kim ke saath kuch or bachche bhaag rahe hai
 At the end of the road there is a swirl of black smoke after the bombings
 yuddh kii tabaahi kaa yah kaala sach duniya ke saamne nahin aata, agar photographer nik ne himmat karke vah tasviir na lee hoti
 Not only did Nick take the picture, but Kim picked him up and took him to the hospital
 jahaan kim kaa ilaaj hua or vah batch gai
 Today Kim has two children and lives in Toronto
 kim ne apane chalisven janmdin par kaha tha ki is tasviir ke jariye main duniya ke liye ummid hum
 The photo received a Pulitzer Prize
 ek or tasviir he sudan kii
 Hunger has made even a small girl helpless
 vah zamin par padi hui he or usase kuch duuri par ek bada sa giddh (vulture) ghur rahaa he
 When this picture of Kevin Carter appeared in the New York Times in 1993, there was a worldwide uproar
 log poochne lage ki us bacchee kaa kya hua
 Did the photographer try to save her
 yah patrakarita ke itihaas kaa sabase vivaadit prasang he, jiske kai pahalu hai
 This photo had put the terrible picture of hunger in front of the whole world
 carter ko bhi is photo ke liye pulitzer puraskaar mila
 These are two different situations
 ek sthiti main photographer apane kirdaar kii madad karata he or duusari sthiti main madad nahin karata, magar donon ko pulitzer puraskaar miltaa he
 In both cases the whole world is shaken
 jaise jantar-mantar par gajendra kii aatmahatya ne kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke prati puure desh kii udaseenta ko jhakzor diya he
 Everything has been exposed
 dhai lakh se zyada kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke sarkari ricard ko ham bas ek kagaz kaa aankada maanane lage the
 Gajendra's photographs have brought millions of farmers who committed suicide alive to the whole country
 maine jin do tasveeron kaa zikr kiya he, unhen bhartiya jansanchaar santhaan (indian Institute of Mass Communication) ke professor anand pradhan prime time ke ek sho main lekar aae the
 We were discussing what a journalist should do on such an occasion
 yah hamaare peshey kii naitikta (ethics) kii sabase badi duvidha he
 There can be no definite answer
 patrkaar reporter yaa photographer se pehle insaan bhi he, lekin yah uskaa kaam bhi he ki vah maukey kii tasviir ko thik us tarah se darj karata chale, jo insaaniyat ke liye kaam aa sakati he
 There can be many types of situations
 sthiti tay karegi ki patrkaar kya karegaa, na ki koi kitaab
 At the Aam Aadmi Party's Kisan rally at Jantar Mantar, Gajendra Singh committed suicide in front of everyone
 vah kisi sanmdar ke bich nahin tha yaa kisi baadh main yaa kisi pul ke neeche bhi nahin tha yaa vah kisi bahumanjila imaarat kii chat par nahin yaa vah chalati train ke bilkul neeche nahin aa gaya tha
 He was already sitting on the tree, which was also requested to be removed
 jise camere se lekar vahaan maujuud sainkadon logon ne dekha
 The police also saw who should have the necessary resources, especially when the Chief Minister was meeting
 ehtiyaat ke taur par fire brigade se lekar ambulance kii gaadi to honi hi chahie
 Now it should tell Delhi government that ambulance will send police or work of government hospital
 kya mukhyamantri karyaalay ne raily ke intazaam ko lekar ye sab sawaal puche the
 It was reported in the media that the police has been told that the Chief Minister should be kept away from journalists
 main isaki pushti nahin kar saktaa, lekin kisi bhi raily se party or police ke bich kai str par samvaad hota he
 There is also a face-to-face meeting
 ab bahes ho rahi he ki vahaan khadi media ko gajendra kii jaan bachaane kaa prayaas karnaa chahie tha
 i was not at Jantar Mantar nor have i spoken to any journalist present there
 phir bhi yah bahes bataa rahi he ki log maukey par ham patrakaron ke vyavhaar ko lekar kitne sanjeeda hai
 The politicians sitting on the stage made a voice to save, but did not run
 unke paas to mike bhi tha, police ko awaz lagaai, magar police ne gajendra ko nahin utaara
 What should have been done to the hundreds of journalists standing there
 agar sabko yaa kisi bhi ek ko apane camere main dikh rahaa he ki koi aadmi fanda daal rahaa he to kya karnaa chahie
 Who knows, a journalist may have made a voice, or what address, nobody has cared
 iskaa jawaab itnaa saral nahin he
 Before asking this question, we must see what the situation is
 agar kisi pul se koi photographer tasviir le rahaa he to vah kya kare
 Do not know how to swim, yet if you drown or swim, then jump in a fast stream
 vahaan khadey kitne patrakaron ko ped par chadhana aata hoga, ise lekar main aashwast nahin hum, magar yah ek zaruri sawaal he
 What should a photographer do if a hut is on fire? kya use rajendra kumaar kii tarah jhonpadi main kud janaa chahie or bachche ko uthaakar laana chahie
 It is very difficult to say all this, because whether the journalist is competent or not is a question
 patrkaar kaa ek kaam to yah hona hi chahie ki report karte hue vah tamaam agenciyon ko alert karata rahe
 The comments par aisa nahin hona chahie ki ham netaaon, police or logon se poochhate-poochhate thak jaaen to ulta press se hi poochne lagen
 The only thing i can say in this situation is that there was no extraordinary situation at Jantar Mantar
 ped par chadhane kaa jokhim na lete hue bhi logon ko alert kiya ja saktaa tha
 If anyone has seen this happening with his camera, he should have created a ruckus
 press ke baaki saathiyon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karnaa chahie tha or recording rokkar vahaan vyavdhaan paidaa karnaa chahie tha, taaki sab gajendra kii jaan bachaane ke liye tatpar ho sake
 Everyone's failure is also the press's failure, but for this, it has to be factually known whether no one has actually alerted anyone there
 main vahaan tha nahin, isliye daawey se nahin kah saktaa
 If you say that the way the press reported, was it fair, then it can be given definite answers and accountability can be fixed
 gajendra to us ped par ab nahin he, magar camaron ke liye ab bhi vah ped zindaa he, jiske neeche khadey hokar reporter ab bhi news room ke aadesh par naatak kar rahe hai ki yahi vah ped he, jisaki ek tahani se gajendra latak gaya tha
 This is the tree that the leaders sitting on the platform kept watching
 ek din hamaare channel ped ko hi kasuurvaar tehra denge
 This is the tree that allowed Gazendra to hang
 yahi vah ped he, jisane gajendra kii jaan le lee
 Do not forget that we are living in the era of Peepli Live
 ek or tasviir he sudan kii
 Hunger has made even a small girl helpless
 vah zamin par padi hui he or usase kuch duuri par ek bada sa giddh (vulture) ghur rahaa he
 When this picture of Kevin Carter appeared in the New York Times in 1993, there was a worldwide uproar
 log poochne lage ki us bacchee kaa kya hua
 Did the photographer try to save her
 yah patrakarita ke itihaas kaa sabase vivaadit prasang he, jiske kai pahalu hai
 This photo had put the terrible picture of hunger in front of the whole world
 carter ko bhi is photo ke liye pulitzer puraskaar mila
 These are two different situations
 ek sthiti main photographer apane kirdaar kii madad karata he or duusari sthiti main madad nahin karata, magar donon ko pulitzer puraskaar miltaa he
 In both cases the whole world is shaken
 jaise jantar-mantar par gajendra kii aatmahatya ne kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke prati puure desh kii udaseenta ko jhakzor diya he
 Everything has been exposed
 dhai lakh se zyada kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke sarkari ricard ko ham bas ek kagaz kaa aankada maanane lage the

 gajendra to us ped par ab nahin he, magar camaron ke liye ab bhi vah ped zindaa he, jiske neeche khadey hokar reporter ab bhi news room ke aadesh par naatak kar rahe hai ki yahi vah ped he, jisaki ek tahani se gajendra latak gaya tha
 This is the tree that the leaders sitting on the platform kept watching
 ek din hamaare channel ped ko hi kasuurvaar tehra denge
 This is the tree that allowed Gazendra to hang
 yahi vah ped he, jisane gajendra kii jaan le lee
 Do not forget that we are living in the era of Peepli Live
 ye do alag-alag sthitiyaan hai
 In one situation the photographer helps his character and in the other situation does not help, but both receive the Pulitzer Prize
 donon hi sthitiyon main puri duniya hill jaati he
 For example, Gajendra's suicide at Jantar Mantar has shaken the indifference of the entire country towards farmers' suicide
 sab ke sab expos ho gaye hai
 We were just beginning to consider the government record of suicide of more than two and a half lakh farmers as a paper
 gajendra kii tasveeron ne aatmahatya karne vaale lakhon kisaanon ko puure desh ke saamne zindaa kar diya he
 The two pictures i have mentioned were brought to me by Professor Pradhan of the Indian Institute of Mass Communication at a prime time show
 ham charchaa kar rahe the ki is tarah ke maukey par kisi patrkaar ko kya karnaa chahie
 This is the biggest dilemma of the ethics of our profession
 iskaa koi ek nishchit uttar nahin ho saktaa he
 a journalist is a human being before a reporter or a photographer, but it is also his job to keep recording the photograph of the occasion in a way that can be useful for humanity
 kai prakaar kii sthiti ho sakati he
 The situation will decide what the journalist will do, not a book
 jantar-mantar par aam aadmi party kii kisaan raily main gajendra singh ne sabake saamne aatmahatya kar lee
 He was not in the middle of any memory or in any flood or under any bridge or he was not on the roof of a multi-storied building or he did not fall under the moving train at all
 vah pehle se ped par baitha tha, jise utaarne kii apil bhi hui
 Which was seen by hundreds of people present from the camera
 police ne bhi dekha, jiske paas zaruri saadhan hone chahie, khaskar tab, jab mukhyamantri kii sabha ho rahi ho
 As a precaution, there should be a train from fire brigade to ambulance
 ab yah dilli sarkaar ko bataanaa chahie ki ambulance police bhejegi yaa sarkari aspataal kaa kaam he
 Did the Chief Minister's Office ask all these questions regarding the arrangement of the rally
 media main yah to khabar ai thi ki police se kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri ko patrakaron se dur rakhaa jaae
 i cannot confirm this, but at any rally, there is a level of dialogue between the party and the police
 aamane-saamne kii baithak bhi hoti he
 It is now being debated that the media standing there should have tried to save Gajendra's life
 main jantar-mantar par nahin tha or na hi vahaan maujuud kisi patrkaar se baat hui he
 Yet this debate is telling how serious people are about the behavior of journalists on the occasion
 vahaan manch par baithe rajanetaaon ne bachaane ke liye awaz to lagaai, magar daud nahin lagaai
 He also had a mike, gave a call to the police, but the police did not field Gajendra
 vahaan khadey saikadon patrakaron ko kya karnaa chahie tha
 What should be done if everyone or any one is seen in their camera that a man is putting a noose
 kya pataa, kisi patrkaar ne awaz lagaai bhi ho, yaa kya pataa, kisi ne parvaah hi nahin kii ho
 The answer is not so simple
 ham yah sawaal poochne se pehle zarur dekhen ki sthiti kya he
 What to do if a photographer is taking a picture from a bridge
 tairnaa nahin aata he, phir bhi dub jaae yaa tairnaa aata bhi he to tej dhara main kud jaae
 i am not sure how many journalists standing there would have climbed the tree, but this is an important question
 agar kisi jhonpadi main aag lagi he to photographer ko kya karnaa chahie
 Should he jump into the hut like Rajendra Kumar and bring the child up
 bahut mushkil he yah sab kahana, kyonki patrkaar sakasham he yaa nahin, yah ek sawaal to he
 The job of a journalist must be that while reporting, he would alert all agencies
 tippaniyan But it should not happen that when we get tired of asking the leaders, police and people, then we start asking the press instead
 is sthiti main main itnaa hi kah saktaa hum ki jantar-mantar par koi asaadhaaran sthiti nahin thi
 People could be alerted even without taking the risk of climbing the tree
 agar kisi ne apane camere se aisa hote hue dekha he, to use hangaamaa karnaa chahie tha
 It should have caught the attention of the rest of the press colleagues and created a disruption there by stopping the recording, so that everyone could be ready to save Gajendra's life
 sabaki naakaami main press kii bhi naakaami he, lekin iske liye yah tathyaatmak rup se jaananaa hoga ki kya vaaki vahaan kisi ne kisi ko alert nahin kiya
 i was not there, so cannot say with the claim
 agar aap yah kahen ki press ne jis tarah se reporting kii, kya vah uchit tha, to iske nishchit jawaab die ja sakate hai or javabdehi tay kii ja sakati he
 Gajendra is no longer on that tree, but that tree is still alive for the cameras, standing under it, the reporters are still pretending on the order of the news room that this is the tree that Gajendra was hanging from a branch
 
 yahi vah ped he, jise manch par baithe netaa dekhte rahe
 One day, our channel will make the tree guilty
 yahi vah ped he, jisane gazendra ko latakane diya
 This is the tree that killed Gajendra
 mat bhuuliega ki ham pipli live ke daur main ji rahe hai

 Also, he said that the biggest strength of the team was bowling, but that too is no more

 Just a day after Union Minister Shashi Tharoor was asked by Congress leaders in Kerala to stop praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi or face disciplinary action, a Congress daily attacked him for his loyalty to the organization
 Has raised doubts
 congress dainik ‘veekshanam’ main likhe katakshapurn sampadakeey main kisi kaa naam liya bina kaha gaya he ki jo log soshal media ke jariye modi ko ‘prem patr’ likhte hai or sampadakeey pannon par khushaamad se bhare lekh likhte hai, unki vafadari par andeh kiya jayega
 Several references to Tharoor's expertise on foreign policy issues are indirectly included in this article
 lekh kaa ant malayalam kii ek kahawat ke saath kiya gaya he, ki ‘‘koi ped yadi ghar ke liye khatra ban gaya ho to use gira dena chahie, phir chaahe us par sona hi kyon na ugta ho
 The editorial said that it is very strange that the person authorized as the Congress spokesperson is praising Modi
 lekh main kaha gaya, congress ke kheme main baithkar bhaajapa dwaara ‘campus salection’ chaahana spasht taur par vishwasghaat ke alaava or kuch nahin he
 Attacking Tharoor, Congress leaders in Kerala warned him against praising Modi
 iske saath hi unhone tharur se yah bhi kaha tha ki yadi ve party line ke anuroop chalane se manaa karenge to unke khilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai kii jaaegi
 This immediate indignation of Congress leaders to Tharoor, who became the second MP from the Kerala capital, is actually due to the positive response from Tharoor to Modi's 'swachh Bharat' campaign
 haalanki tharur ne apni safai dete hue kaha tha ki unhen ‘congress sadsy hone kaa garv he’ or unhone bhaajapa ke ‘hindutv ke agenda’ ko jaraa bhi protsaahit nahin kiya
 Clarifying his stand, Tharoor said that he did not support Prime Minister Narendra Modi and today he has appealed to the Prime Minister's Office to work for 'cleaning up bigotry and hatred' in India, for which Mahatma Gandhi really stood up 
 unhone twit kiya, main bharat ke pradhanmantri karyaalay se apil karata hum ki vah ek aise bharat ke liye kaam kare, jo kattarta, ghrinaa, ashishnutaa or bhedbhaav se mukt ho

 is saal jat andolan ke dauraan hui hinsa kii jaanch kii report saunpane ke baad prakaash singh ne kaha he ki unhen kisi kii naukari kii jarurat nahin he, main janhit main kaam karata hum
 Manohar Lal Khattar had made a statement in the assembly that Prakash Singh himself submitted a report on implementing police reforms in Haryana
 jisase ham unhen phir se naukari den
 What did Prakash Singh say? Prakash Singh said to Aaj Tak that 'I was shocked to hear the Chief Minister of Haryana
 haryana sarkaarne mujhe madad ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 He had said this in a written order on 25 February i
e
 6 months ago to improve the police system
 ' iske baad prakaash singh ne kaha ki siem ne naukari kii baat sochi kaise? main paise ke liye kaam nahin karata
 He said that his first report did not suit the people of Bureaucracy
 isliye ve nahin chaahate kii ham dobaaraa aaen
 Why the controversy increased? CM Manohar Lal Khattar said in the Assembly that Prakash Singh was asked to report on the violence during the Sejat movement
 lekin prakaash singh apni ichha se police sudhaaron ko lekar report saunpna chaahate hai
 But the government does not need that report
 isliye unhen naukari nahin di gai

 Claims up to 1989 remained pending before the civil court in Faizabad

 In 1959, Nirmohi Akhara filed a claim and requested the receiver to take charge
 1961 main sunni central vakf board ne ghoshnaatmak vaad daayar kar vivaadit sthal kaa kabja dilaaye jane kaa aagrah kiya
 The fourth claim was filed in 1989 in the name of Lord Shri Ram Lala Virajaman through 'next Friend'

 After this, the people of the Babri Masjid side appealed to the court on 21 February 1950 and demanded that since the mosque was built in 1528 by Babar's general Mir Baqi
 isliye ise muslim samuday ko saunpa jaye, jiske virodh main hindu sanghathan ne adaalat ke baahar jamkar pradarshan kiya
 Meanwhile, Ramchandra Paramahansa, the then president of Ram Janma Bhoomi Trust, filed a petition to leave the Ramjanmabhoomi in the court on 5 December 1950, but this petition got stuck in the court's claim and after seeing that almost five years passed

 duusari ore, masjid kii jameen ko apane kabje main lene ke liye sunni central vakf board ne 1961 main nyaayalay main vaad daakhil kiya, jisase vivaad or ulajhata hi chalaa gaya

 iske baad may 1986 main sunni vakf board ne bhi ucch nyaayalay main taala khole jane ke viruddh yachika daayar kii

 However, the new health care law will also have a disastrous effect

 Some facts about the shutdown The reason for the shutdown: According to the constitution, Parliament is required to pass a budget spending law
 agar is par sahmati nahin ban paati to sarkaar paise kharch nahin kar sakati
 Obligation of Shutdown: Government agencies cannot ignore this shutdown even if they want to

 Sources in intelligence agencies have informed Aaj Tak that 298 militants of different Tanjim are still present in Jammu and Kashmir
 sutron ne ajtak ko jaankaree di he ki kashmir ghati main is samay sabase zyada lashkar ke 80 pakistani aatanki or 55 sthaneey aatanki maujuud hai
 Apart from this, 22 Pakistani terrorists and 19 local terrorists of jaish-e-mohammed are still active in Kashmir
 sutron ne yah daawa kiya he ki is samay pakistan kii khufia agency iesai hijbul mujahidin ke videshi or sthaneey aatankwaadiyon par oparation ke liye bharosa nahin kar rahi he
 However, the number of local Hizbul militants in Kashmir is 102, which is the highest
 bhartiya suraksha agenciyaan lagaataar is baat par maathapai kar rahi hai ki in aatankwaadiyon kaa khaatmaa kaise kiya jaae
 However, this year, security forces have piled up more than 30 militants in the Kashmir Valley so far
 suraksha bal is baat ko lekar kaaphi chintit hai ki aatanki ab hamale karne ke puraane trend se hatakar fidaayin hamalaa or aatmghaatee hamalaa karne kii training iesai or paak army se le rahe hai
 Sources have claimed that Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI and its army, jaish-e-mohammed, have been training militants to carry out fidayeen attacks in Tezin terrorist training camp in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir
 sutron ne yah daawa kiya he ki jaish ke aatankwaadiyon ko pakistan jahaan par training de rahaa he vah training camp pehle pakistan kii sena istemaal karti thi
 Now the Pakistan Army has given this camp to the jaish-e-mohammed militants for training
 udhar suraksha agenciyon ne yah bhi jaankaree di he ki lashkar kaa mastermind hafiz said bhi paak adhikrut kashmir ke "boi" training camp main aatankwaadiyon ko bade str par training dilava rahaa he
 Sources reveal that for this Hafiz Saeed's son Talha Saeed has visited the Boi Training Camp several times with the help of ISI, Pakistan's intelligence agency
 yahi nahin, is boi main kareeb 45 aatanki alag-alag camp main pakistan kii special sarvice group se training le rahe hai
 Why jem is in the hunt to target the security forces? Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir have piled up 244 last year and 30 terrorists this year under Operation All Out
 jisamen jaish-e-mohammad ke local or videshi aatanki maare gaye hai
 Security sources have informed that Jaish terrorists have been piled in large numbers by security forces
 maare gaye jaish ke aatankiyon main videshi yani pakistani sabase zyada hai
 Aaj Tak has a complete list of Pakistani terrorists killed in the Kashmir Valley of jaish-e-mohammed, with the most important names being Chhotu alias Qari Mustaq, Mohammed Adil alias Mohammad Bhai, Rashid Bhai alias Khalid Khan, Omar Khalid, Yasir, Ashfaq Ahmed Khan alias Harish Khan Abid Maqbool Bhatt alias Omar Bhai, they are all terrorists from Pakistan who have been killed by the security forces this year

 This is the reason that the terrorists have killed 40 soldiers in a suicide attack and have caused great harm

 gajiabad ke siddharth vihaar ke brahmaputra enklev main pichley 5 din main chori kii 3 badi vaaradaaten ho chuki hai, lekin apradhi gajiabad police kii pahunch se ab bhi dur hai
 On 31 January, two other incidents of theft took place in the same enclave on 4 February, after stealing several lakhs of jewelery and cash from the house in the block number 54 of the Brahmaputra Enclave
 block number 54 main hui chori ke bare main abhi tak kii cese kii pragati ke aadhaar police mahaj chaanbin hi kar rahi he
 Talking to top level officials is being investigated, but nothing has been achieved yet
 phir 4 farvari ko brahmaputra enklev ke block number 15 or 16 ke ek-ek flats main lage lohe kii kundi ko katkar choron ne hajaaron rupee ke saamaanon par haath pher liya
 Earlier, on January 31, a similar incident of theft took place before 11 am in Block Number 54 when Surendra Kumar and his wife went to attend PTM at their son's school
 mahaj ek ghante main jab ve pitim se waapas aae to unhen ghar kaa darwaja khulaa mila
 On entering the house, an iron cupboard was found open, from which the thieves stole jewelery (of gold and silver) worth Rs 5-6 lakh
 gajiabad jile ke vijay nagar thane main police se is sambandh main shikaayat karne ke baad jaanch shuru kii gai, lekin isamen abhi tak koi thos jaankaree haath nahin lagi he
 However, after the FIR was registered in relation to the theft, the police initially started a thorough investigation and also picked up some suspects on the basis of suspicion and interrogated them a long time, but they were released after some time
 block number 54 main chori kii is ghatana par abhi police kuch bhi hasil nahin kar saki thi ki 2 anya block main bhi chori kii ghatana ho gai
 At present, the criminals are still far from the grip due to the slowness of the police
 bihar kii siyasat ke betaab badshaah kahe jane vaale argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav sajayaftaa hone ke chalate jail main hai, lekin philhal ilaaj ke liye ranchi ke rems hospital main bhartee hai
 Due to this, Lalu Yadav will neither enter the election rally of Bihar nor will his voice be heard
 pichley chaar dashak kii raajnneetik main pehali baar hoga jab lalu yadav ke bina bihar kaa chunavi sangram hoga
 In such a situation, Mahabharata is also sprinkled in his clan and the two sons who describe themselves as krishna-arjuna are face to face
 aise main argedy ke liye andar or baahar donon chunautiyon se samaanaa karnaa pad rahaa he
 In the 1970s, Lalu Yadav started his political journey from zero and struggled from road to parliament to become the voice of the Dalits, backward and underprivileged in Bihar
 15 saal tak bihar kii satta par kabiz rahane ke baad lalu ko 2005 ke rajya vidhansabha chunaav main jabardast jhatka laga
 But after Modi's political rise at the center, Lalu appeared in his old attitude
 2014 main haar se hataash vipaksh ko lalu ne jeet kaa formula diya
 In Bihar, Lalu formed a grand alliance with Nitish
 bihar main yah raajnneetik sameekaran modi-shah par baari padaa or isane mahabandhan ke paksh main voton kii barsaat kar di
 This not only ended the bjp's victory but also raised an expectation in the opposition that the Narendra Modi and Amit Shah duo could be defeated
 lalu ne ek baar phir jataa diya ki siyaasi daanvpech main unka koi jod nahin he
 For the first time in 40 years of Bihar's politics, Lalu Prasad Yadav is not seen in the electoral battlefield
 lalu kii anupasthit main argedy kii bagdor unke bete or bihar ke purv dipti siem tejasvi yadav sambhaal rahe hai
 But the biggest headache for him remains his elder brother Tej Pratap
 argedy netaa va rajyasabha sadsy manoj jha ne ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kaha, 'laluji ke bina bihar hi nahin balki uttar bharat main chunaav kii pariklpana nahin kii ja sakati he
 True, his absence matters to RJD, but what matters, which people and what conspiracies his absence makes, is more important
 aise main jaahir he ki chunaav ke dauraan log apane netaa ko apane bich dekhnaa chaahate hai, lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 All efforts were made by the ruling party that Laluji should not be present in the election
 bihar kaa janata iskaa munhtod jawaab dene kaa man bana chuki he
 Senior journalist Himanshu Mishra, who has closely watched the politics of Bihar, says that even though Lalu Yadav may be in jail, he still exists in the politics of Bihar as a myth
 jail main rahete hue lalu ne jis tarah se dalon ko jodakar gathbandhan or siton kaa bantwaaraa kiya
 It is clear that Lalu managed to register a strong presence even in his absence
 isiilie lalu ke kamare kii talaashi kii gai
 He said that with Lalu's stay in jail, the only wrong message is going on that the family is not caring
 raajnneetik viraasat ke liye donon bete aamane-saamne hai
 In such a situation, if Lalu was outside, there would not have been such discord in the family
 iske alaava sipiai se jo gathbandhan nahin ho sakaa, use wo sulajhaa lete
 There has been a loss in this sense while in jail
 iske alaava jail main rahane se jis varg main sahanubhuti he vah varg hameshaa se unke saath rahaa he
 Despite the Modi wave, the RJD has more than 20 percent of the vote, so Lalu's stay in jail could increase the voting percentage in the rjd's Yadav and Muslim
 raajnneetik vishleshak aligarh muslim ke professor mohammad sajaad kehete hai ki lalu yadav maidan main rahen yaa na rahen, lekin unki raay to logon ke saamne aa rahi he
 RJD will get political benefit of Lalu's stay in jail, because his people believe that Lalu has been kept in jail under a conspiracy by the upperclass and BJP
 jabaki duusare ghotaale ke aaropee baahar gum rahe hai
 The people of RJD are portraying Lalu Yadav as a victim
 haalanki lalu ke chunavi maidan main na rahane se unke bhaashan or anokhe andaaj nahin dekhne ko milegaa
 Let me tell you that after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Lalu Yadav was the only leader who worked to put a brake on the victory chariot of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 lalu yadav ne nitish kumaar ke saath dushmani bhulaakar haath milaayaa or nayaa raajnneetik sameekaran banaaya
 The result was that in the 2015 assembly elections, the modi-shah duo had to be defeated in Bihar
 haalanki argedy-jediu kaa ye saath bahut zyada dinon tak nahin chal sakaa
 In 2018, Nitish left Lalu and re-aligned with BJP to form the government
 jediu loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi or algepi ke saath maidan main utari he
 At the same time, Tejashwi Yadav, who is holding the political legacy of Lalu Yadav, has formed a grand alliance with several parties including the Congress
 isamen argedy, congress, hindustana awam morcha, araspi or viipi party ne milakar gathbandhan kiya he

 pehali baat ki hindi main nai peedi ke rachanakaaron ne apni maujuudagi darj karaani shuru kii he
 Among them are Divya Prakash Dubey to Nikhil Sankhatak and Satya Vyas to Ajit Bharati
 isi peedi ne nai hindi kaa shigupha bhi choda he
 But it is not yet defined what is the new Hindi? However, Dark Horse is Nilotpal Mrinal's first work and first novel
 is upanyaas main aapako vahi dhara najar aegi joyupi 65,banaras tokijayamusafir cafejaise upanyaason main dikhaai di thi
 In fact, the popularity of Chetan Bhagat has started a plant of new creators in Hindi and Neelotpal Mrinal seems to be pouring out paper on the discomfort of creativity
 yah peedi kham thonk rahi he ki hindi ab mathadhishon kii jaagir nahin he or isliye log bina aalochakon kii parvaah kiye, manmarjee kaa likh rahe hai or chap rahe hai
 This is a period of democratization of literature
 apni bhoomika main hi mrinal likhte hai ki unhone upanyaas ke rup main koi sahitya nahin rachaa he
 good! Is this a statement to avoid the attention of critics or a humble claim? However, this work has received the Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar
 is lihaaj se yah kaha ja saktaa he ki lekhak ne is kriti ko vaaki sahitya mana hoga or use is puraskaar ke liye namit bhi kiya hoga
 So mixing roles and awards is a confusing situation
 kaahe ki, agar yah upanyaas, bakaul lekhak, sahitya nahin he, to unhen yah puraskaar lene se inkaar kar dena chahie tha
 This novel cannot be judged in terms of style or narrative
 kai dfa padhate hue aapako isamen maujuuda dhara ke banaras kendrit aadha darjan upanyaason kii jhalak dikhegi, sanvaadon menkshithij royke upanyasgandi batkaa aks dikhegaa
 But if you or someone in your family has ever prepared for civil service in Vijayanagar, Mukherjee Nagar and Katwaria Sarai in Patna, Allahabad, North or South Campus of Delhi, then this novel is a must read
 upanyaas ke 95 fisadi pannon main abhyarthiyon ke naakaamiyon kaa daastaan he
 And also of the hero, that is, the lanterns of the dark horse
 par uske sangharsh ko bina dikhaae dedh paragraph main nipataakar mrinal ne sidhe use safal ghoshit kar diya
 The stylistic jerk appears here
 par, civil seva abhyarthiyon ke maansikta or manovigyaan ko mrinal ne karine se pakadaa he
 There is a dialogue in the novel, 'people will do ma-phd in the day of Zetna, if they are read by the honk, then i will become like IAS in the day
 ’ yah samvaad samajhie abhgharthiyon ke manovigyaan ko pakadta he, jo saal-dar-saal kis tarah taiyaariyon main jute rahete hai
 Candidates have high and beautiful dreams in Dark Horse, referring to responsibilities
 thasak he
 The family and the village are excited about their dignity and salvation for the next several generations
 mukherjee nagar ko ukerte hue mrinal ekadam eemaandaar tasviir pesh karte hai
 As if you were sitting at a window watching all the characters and scenes come true
 par saath hi, isamen ek filmi or bollywoodiya naatakeeyata bhi he
 In the same dramatics, there is also an uncle from the village, who insists on showing Delhi
 usee main garibi bhi he, gaanv kii bikati hui jameen bhi he
 There is also the new-age love that happens many times
 par upanyaas main us tanaavpurn clymex kii kami he, jo ek kriti ko behatar banaati he
 If you have read the recent Hindi novels with a keen eye, you will hardly get new characters
 aapako banaras kendrit upanyaason ke hi paatr dikhenge, bas lagegaa ki theatre main peeche kaa set badal diya gaya ho
 The canvas has changed, the characters just appear in different clothes
 ho saktaa he hamaare yug kaa satya yahi ho
 By the way, Mrinal's praise is that he has not played his characters with a collar
 unke paatr jab jo chaha, bolte he
 Perhaps that's why Mrinal does not put his work in the status of literature
 haalanki, sahitya main shuchita jaisi chijen bemaani hai (goki sahitya samaaj kaa darpan hota he) par, kirdaaron main vibhinnata, unke bhavatmak yatra main aaroh-avaroh main vaividhya kii ummid to kii hi ja sakati he
 Overall the novel is readable, as well
 par kathy ke lihaaj se ausat he
 Mrinal is a writer of possibilities, so it will be interesting to see what story he brings next time

 Even before such an event has been organized, before this, in 2004, the Election Commission organized a similar workshop

 But even then many veterans, including BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani, questioned the credibility of evms after losing elections badly
 chunaav ayog ne bataaya ki 2009 main bhi iviem kii vishwasniyata par sawaal uthaae jane ke baad hamane khulaa chalange diya tha, lekin koi ise sabit nahin kar sakaa

 After the return of the government car by East Delhi Mayor Bipin Bihari Singh, all eyes are now on North Delhi Mayor Adesh Gupta

 Now it will be interesting to see if the Mayor of North Delhi like the Mayor of East Delhi returns his government car or not, as recently Aadesh Gupta had written a letter to LG Anil Baijal about the lack of funds in the North MCD
 alji ko likhe khat main gupta ne maang kii thi ki chauthe vitt ayog ke mutabik north emsidi ko 1,493 karod kii raashi dilwaai jaae

 The desire to find happiness remains in everyone's mind
 america main swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa main kaha gaya ki khushi or aazaadee paanaa har vyakti kaa adhikaar he
 Every religion and philosophy shows the way to reach happiness
 main kisi bhi ek dharm kii baat nahin kar rahaa, lekin kisi dharm ke niyamon par chalakar aapako khushi milti he to uskaa paalan avashya karen
 Whatever one says, real happiness is hidden in your purpose
 yah uddeshy aapke puure jivan ko prabhavit karte hai
 If you have not set goals for different walks of life then you should think in this direction
 bahari paristhitiyon va unase nipatane ke tareeke par prasannataa nirbhar karti he
 Moving towards specific goals also increases the level of happiness
 hamen apane lakshyon ke prati spasht hona chahie
 It is difficult to walk even one step without aiming
 phir aapako un lakshyon kii purti ke liye samay seemaa tay kerani chahie
 Then start working on the plan and make changes where needed
 jaise-jaise aap lakshya kii ore badhenge, prasannataa badhati chali jaaegi
 You must have noted that when people pass an exam and move to the next class or come to the service after taking the civil service examination, they have no place to be happy
 mujhe aaj bhi yaad he ki 27 may, 1961 ko jab mujhe ipies ke liye chun liya gaya tha to main kitna garvit or prasann tha
 Failure to reach the goal, jealousy, sadness, fatigue, loneliness, relationship troubles and fear of becoming bad in the eyes of others, etc
 become obstacles in the path of happiness
 prasannataa paane ke liye acchhee sehat, tayshuda lakshya, swasth sambandh, paryaapt kamai, paariwarik sneh, utpaadak kaary or sakaaratmak ravaie kaa hona jaruri hota he
 In my opinion, good health means that there is no disease in the body
 isse jivan main josh aata he or jeene kaa majaa doguna ho jaataa he
 Good health does not mean that your health is as good as that of an Olympic player
 khaansee, zukam yaa bukhaar aadi choti-moti pareshaani kaa arth yah nahin hota ki ham sehatmand nahin hai
 These temporary problems resolve themselves
 acchhee sehat ke bina ham na to jivan main kuch paa sakate hai or na hi aajeevika kama sakate hai
 a positive attitude, a comfortable sense of events and circumstances and a good opinion about people bring our happiness closer
 hamen baat-baat par niraash hone kii aadat bhi chhod deni chahie
 These facts can increase your level of happiness: 1
 utsukata, aaveg, josh 2
 Favorite job 3
 avaiyaktik pahunch 4
 Hard work is chosen by everyone to be happy

 neshnal board for wild line (NBWL) kii standing cameti ne paryaavaran mantralay se kanoonee salaah lekar faisalaa diya he ki tel or gas ke liye kii jane vaali drilling khanan kii paribhaasha main nahin aati he
 a lawsuit was held to protest against drilling in a radius of one km from the Sariska Reserve in Rajasthan
 supreme court ne faisla diya ki neshnal park or abhyaarany ke ek kimi ke daayre main koi khanan kaary nahin hoga
 So the decision was cut down that the definitions of mining and drilling were differentiated, while the report states that drilling was also done under the supervision of the mining department
 ab is faisle ke kya myne hai, pahalu hai, ham log kaise samaj sakate hai jab standing cameti ke sadasyon ne yah kah kar nai vyakhya sweekaar kar lee ki ve to sangrakshan ke visheshgy hai, kanoon ke nahin

 Our colleague Sushil Bahuguna has made several reports on melting of Himalayan glaciers
 unki nazar baraabar rahati he ki vahaan kii tazaa ghatana kya he
 96% of the glacier ice is in Antarctica followed by Greenland in the Arctic with 12%
 iske baad sabase zyaada glacier himalay main hai jise isi vajah dharti kaa teesraa dhruv kaha jaataa he
 Gangotri is one of the largest glaciers from which the water released quenches the thirst of North India's population of 500 million
 lekin beeti ek do sadi is glacier par baari beeti hai, ye lagaataar peeche khisakta ja rahaa he
 However, recent scientific surveys are showing that the speed of slipping behind this glacier has decreased
 2008 se 2016 tak ke adhyayan ke mutabik ab ye har saal 11 meter peeche khisak rahaa he jabaki 1974 main iske peeche khisakane kii dar ausatan 35 meter prativarsh thi
 According to another study, since 1817, this glacier has slipped backward by three kilometers
 isamen bhi zyaada chintaa kii baat ye he ki tees kilometre lambey is glacier kaa base lagaataar patala hota ja rahaa he yani isaki barf kii motaai lagaataar ghat rahi he

 It took millions of years before the fauna disappeared from the earth, but now within a few years many animals are becoming extinct

 hamaare sahyogi susheel bahuguna himalay ke glaciaron ke pighalane par kai report kar chuke hai
 He keeps an eye on what is the latest incident there
 glaciaron kii barf kaa 96% hissaa antarctic main he or uske baad 12% hissaa arctic ilaake main greenland par he
 After this, most of the glaciers are in the Himalayas, which is called the third pole of the earth
 gangotri sabase bade glaciaron main se ek he jisase nikalne vaala pani uttar bharat kii pachaas karod kii aabaadi kii pyaas bujhaata he
 But the past two centuries have been heavy on this glacier, it is constantly moving backwards
 haalanki tazaa vaigyanik survey bataa rahe hai ki is glacier ke peeche khisakane kii raftaar kam hui he
 According to the study from 2008 to 2016, it is now slipping backwards by 11 meters every year, whereas in 1974 it slipped backward on average by 35 meters per year
 ek anya adhyayan ke mutabik 1817 se ab tak ye glacier teen kilometre peeche khisak chukaa he
 It is also a matter of greater concern that the base of this glacier, thirty kilometers long, is constantly thinning, that is, its ice thickness is constantly decreasing

 Due to the water of this glacier, many sources of water used to come out from inside the land in the vicinity of Leh but now it has reduced considerably
 isi vajah se leh ilaake ko ab pani ke sankat kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The biggest feature of environmental crisis is that no one is morally responsible for it, then you cannot ask for someone's resignation
 ab aate hai un chizon par jo paryaavaran sankat ke kaaran hameshaa ke liye dharti se mukt ho chuke hai

 The researcher says that a lot of animals which are commonly seen here are also on the verge of extinction
 professor Gerardo ceballos ne kaha he ki sthiti itani bhayaavah he ki agar kathor shabd kaa istemaal naa kiya jaae to or bhi bura hoga
 An American scientist says that it is not right to say the function until everything is extinct, but the situation is terrible

 Flood, drought, firefighters are all old words now

 The quality with disaster is that management seems relaxed
 van na rahe, paryaavaran na rahe, nadi na rahe, talab na rahe magar aapadaa prabandhan jab tak he chintaa kii baat nahin he
 Had it been under the Ministry of Environment, it would have lost some confidence but the good thing is that disaster management is under the Ministry of Home Affairs
 van vibhaag un jagahon par bhi he jahaan van nahin hai

 This part of the edge of the Antarctica peninsula broke apart

 The shelf is the part of the iceberg that floats on the sea

 The part that is separated is 1100 feet thick from the shore, or can also be called deep and its spread is 5800 square kilometers

 hamaare sahyogi susheel bahuguna himalay ke glaciaron ke pighalane par kai report kar chuke hai
 He keeps an eye on what is the latest incident there
 glaciaron kii barf kaa 96% hissaa antarctic main he or uske baad 12% hissaa arctic ilaake main greenland par he
 After this, most of the glaciers are in the Himalayas, which is called the third pole of the earth
 gangotri sabase bade glaciaron main se ek he jisase nikalne vaala pani uttar bharat kii pachaas karod kii aabaadi kii pyaas bujhaata he
 But the past two centuries have been heavy on this glacier, it is constantly moving backwards
 haalanki tazaa vaigyanik survey bataa rahe hai ki is glacier ke peeche khisakane kii raftaar kam hui he
 According to the study from 2008 to 2016, it is now slipping backwards by 11 meters every year, whereas in 1974 it slipped backward on average by 35 meters per year
 ek anya adhyayan ke mutabik 1817 se ab tak ye glacier teen kilometre peeche khisak chukaa he
 It is also a matter of greater concern that the base of this glacier, thirty kilometers long, is constantly thinning, that is, its ice thickness is constantly decreasing
 bhojbasa kaa jangal hi samaapt ho gaya
 You must have heard the banquet on which ancient manuscripts were written

 In the Ladakh region beyond the Himalayas, the impact of human activities has started appearing on the glaciers

 Due to the water of this glacier, many sources of water used to come out from inside the land in the vicinity of Leh but now it has reduced considerably
 isi vajah se leh ilaake ko ab pani ke sankat kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The biggest feature of environmental crisis is that no one is morally responsible for it, then you cannot ask for someone's resignation

 An American scientist says that it is not right to say the function until everything is extinct, but the situation is terrible

 This month you must have seen this footage of a few seconds in news channels
 antarctic peninsula ke kinare kaa ye hissaa darak kar alag ho gaya
 This end is called the Larsen Sea Ice Shelf
 shelf himkhand ke us hisse ko kehete hai jo samudr par tairta he
 There is a stir among scientists from all over the world
 jo hissaa alag hua he wo kinare se 1100 foot motaa he, yaa gaharaa bhi kah sakate hai or iskaa failaav 5800 varg kilometre he
 In which two-two Delhi can be merged
 ye aais shelf hazaron saal puraane hai
 What caused the crack, is not a concrete answer
 duniya ke gyaat itihaas main isburg ke pighalane yaa darkane kii ye teesri badi ghatana he
 Our colleague Sushil Bahuguna has made several reports on melting of Himalayan glaciers
 unki nazar baraabar rahati he ki vahaan kii tazaa ghatana kya he
 96% of the glacier ice is in Antarctica followed by Greenland in the Arctic with 12%
 iske baad sabase zyaada glacier himalay main hai jise isi vajah dharti kaa teesraa dhruv kaha jaataa he
 Gangotri is one of the largest glaciers from which the water released quenches the thirst of North India's population of 500 million
 lekin beeti ek do sadi is glacier par baari beeti hai, ye lagaataar peeche khisakta ja rahaa he
 However, recent scientific surveys are showing that the speed of slipping behind this glacier has decreased
 2008 se 2016 tak ke adhyayan ke mutabik ab ye har saal 11 meter peeche khisak rahaa he jabaki 1974 main iske peeche khisakane kii dar ausatan 35 meter prativarsh thi
 According to another study, since 1817, this glacier has slipped backward by three kilometers

 The forest of Bhojbasa was finished

 This is not the case here

 Especially the Fouche Glacier, which supplies water to Leh, has shrunk a lot
 is glacier ke pani se hi leh ke aasapaas ke ilaakon main zamin ke andar se pani ke kai strot nikalate the lekin ab ye kaafii kam ho gayi hai
 For this reason, the Leh region is now facing a water crisis
 paryaavaran sankat kii sabase badi kubi hoti he ki iske liye naitik rup se koi zimmedaar nahin hota he to aap kisi kaa istipha nahin maang sakate hai
 Now come to those things which have been freed from the earth forever due to environmental crisis
 10 july ke gardian akhbaar main ek report chhapi ki hamaari dharti chathe maas ekstingshan kii ore bad rahi he
 Mass extension means the creation of a situation in which a large number of animal species are lost forever
 research kaa kahana he ki bahut saare jeev jantu jo saamaanya taur par yahaan vahaan dikh jate hai wo bhi ab vilupt hone kii kagaar par hai
 Professor Gerardo ceballos has said that the situation is so frightening that it would be worse if harsh words were not used
 ek america vaigyanik kaa kahana he ki jab tak sab vilupt nahin ho jaataa he tab tak ekstinction kahana thik nahin magar sthiti bhayaavah he
 It took millions of years before the fauna disappeared from the earth, but now within a few years many animals are becoming extinct
 jitne bhi jeev jantu hai unka aadha dharti se gaayab ho chukaa he
 Some people working on environment and fauna in India are constantly documenting these things

 While reading The Vanishing, it felt that it should be carried among the audience
 aapako dianasor yaad he? hamaare aapke bachche ab plastic ke dianasor se khelte hai
 Six and a half billion years ago, when an asteroid collided with the earth, half of the animals disappeared
 saamaanya rup se jeev jantu dharti se gaayab hote rahete hai magar unki raftaar kaaphi dhimi hoti he
 Every year one to five animals continue to depart from the earth, but in recent years, one thousand to ten thousand animals are disappearing forever in a year
 bharat kii dharti se aciatic chita hameshaa ke liye gaayab ho gaya
 When India became independent, three male cheetahs were present in Korea of chhattisgarh
 lekin vahaan ke maharaja ramanuj pratap singh ne unhen maar diya
 Raja Saheb has the distinction of killing 1100 tigers
 pichhali sarkaar namibia se chita aayaat karnaa chaahati thi magar supreme court ne roak laga di
 Between 1875 and 1915 some two hundred thousand wolves and one and a half million leopards were hunted
 1935 tak bihar ke darbhanga main gulabi sir vaali battakh hoti thi lekin uske baad se dekhi hi nahin gayi
 Tiger, the tiger was also going extinct, but the efforts made in this direction have some positive results
 bharat main tarah-tarah ke neshnal park or wild life sanctuary hai
 We do not know what changes are happening in their inner world
 kyonki ham uttar bharat ke das baarah netaaon ke bayaan main hi uljhe rahete hai or unke bayaan main kabhi neshnal park yaa jeev jantuon ke sawaal to aate nahin
 Prerna Bindra has written that many sanctuaries do not get funds in time and even if they get less then they get less
 1969 main indian bastard kii pehali baar gananaa kii gai, tab isaki sankhya 1260 thi
 Now it is on the verge of extinction

 Hangul also survives in the number of two hundred - three hundred
 1990 ke baad se ab tak hamane vikaas ke liye 250 varg kilometre kshetrafal ke baraabar jangal kaat die hai
 So it is clear that the house of these creatures may have been destroyed
 tamaam phool pattiyaan bhi to gaayab ho gai hongi
 This is a crocodile
 chambal ke ilaake main paaya jaataa he magar 22 foot lanbaa hone ke baad bhi sharmila hota he
 Smugglers killed it and made purses and shoes for us and when it disappeared, an attempt was made to save it
 magar ab to ghadiyal ke rahane kii jo prakritik jagah he uskaa 90 fisadi hissaa nasht ho gaya he
 Even the animals we worship as deities are not able to save them
 di venishing main hathi kii haalat padhakar man dukhi ho gaya
 Will elephants also end now? Comments urisa kaa ek video he
 The video shows that Lakshmi, the mother of child elephants, loves her children as much as she loves her children
 jangal khatm ho gaye to chalate-chalate jaanavar insaan kii aabaadi tak aa jaataa he
 The person is surrounded by a circle and starts killing him
 is hathi ko kis tarah chhedaa ja rahaa he or lakshmi naam kii hathi kaise dhamka kar waapas apane bacchon ke paas laut ja rahi he
 Its house has been taken away but no one cares
 vikaas ke naam par jangalon ko barbaad kar diya gaya phir is desh main 24 fisadi kisaan garibi rekha se neeche hai
 Poverty is such that what is the line and what is the line without
 ham kitni baar kehete hai ki bharat kii sadakon par har saal sava lakh se zyaada log durghatnaon main maare jate hai
 We never thought that hundreds of thousands of animals were crushed and killed in the middle of the national park or even on the roads passing through the shore
