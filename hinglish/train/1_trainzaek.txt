 'paap or anya kahaniyaan' main unki kuch kahaniyaan shaamil hai, jinhen unke samvednaa or samaaj kii gahari samaj ke liye janaa gaya he
 In the story collection of Parmita, she is clearly seen taking the favor of the deprived people of the society and her hatred towards the eat, drink, aghaya people is also evident

 Deepawali did not bring any happiness for 62-year-old Rajat Gupta, who was once a symbol man
 1994 main pratishthit prabandhan salaahkaar company makkinji kaa netritv karne vaale ve america ke baahar janme pehle vyakti bane the
 In that capacity, he was the first person of Indian origin to head a major global company
 26 aktubar kii subah unhone epabiai ke saamne aatmasamarpan kar diya, or ve insidar trading ke aaropon main neuyork main giraftaar kar liye gaye
 He was later paid $ 1 crore (rs 50 crore)
 ) ke muchalke par chhod diya gaya
 Gupta has been charged with five counts of securities fraud and one case of conspiracy to fraud in securities
 sabit hone par in aaropon main adhiktam 105 saal kii kaid kii sajaa ho sakati he
 His trial will begin from 9 April
 america adhikari gupta ko fansane ke liye qamar kase hai, jo raaj rajaratnam insidar trading maamle main pakade gaye sabase jane-maane gaiyr wal street cheharaa hai
 Rajaratnam was convicted in May of earning millions from share deals on the basis of illegally found clues and was sentenced to 11 years in prison in October
 gupta ko hiraasat main liye jane se na sirf wal street balki america bhar ke bordrumon ke liye korporate gadabadiyon par ek kadaa sandesh hoga
 Gupta's downfall is as miraculous as his rise
 kolkata main janme gupta ke mata-pita kii maut unke 18 varsh ke hone se pehle ho chuki thi
 With a scholarship, he studied mechanical engineering from IIT Delhi and was boarding the plane for the first time when he left for Harvard Business School to pursue an MBA
 harvard ke baad ve makkinji se jude or teji se seedhiyaan chadhate hue uske mukhya karyaadhikari ban gaye
 During his nine-year tenure as the mckinsey chief, Gupta became comfortable and fluent and liked to quote from Geeta in conversation, knowing most of America's top executives by his first name
 ve achche-khaase amir bhi ho gaye, unke paas colorado main ek bada pashu farm he or connecticut ke westport main unki paanch acre kii ek sampatti he jiske aadhaar par ab unhen muchalke par choda gaya he
 In addition, he owns a house in Florida worth several hundred thousand dollars
 unhone kai dharmarth kaam kiye hai- hyderabad main indian skool of bijness or public health foundation of india kii sthapana main madad kii
 In 2005, he was made special advisor to UN secretary-general Kofi Annan on management reforms
 lekin gupta isse bhi adhik chaahate the
 After leaving mckinsey, he wanted to enter the world of private equity and hedge funds from which the latest and richest icons of corporate America were emerging during the economic ascent between 2000 and 2008
 arbapatiyon ke club ne unhen aakarshith kiya
 One of them was Rajaratnam
 gupta ke bare main rajaratnam ne kaha tha, ''ve (henry) crawis (ek badi nijee equity form ke maalik) se mugdh the, or meraa khyaal he ve us toli main janaa chaahate the, arbapatiyon kii toli main
 
 
 i think they need $ 100 million (rs 500 crore) in next 5-10 years without much work
 ) kamaane kaa mauka dikh rahaa tha
 This desire led to his close association with Rajaratnam
 iske baavjood chah maheene pehle tak gupta ke jail jane kii sambhaavna nahin thi kyonki america adhikariyon ne rajaratnam maamle main unke khilaaf aapraadhik aaropon par jor na dene kaa faisla kiya tha
 On March 1, 2011, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the stock market controller of the US, filed a civil case against Gupta in a special court of the SEC
 america kanoon ke tahat divaani prashasnic prakriya main kisi ko doshi sabit karwaanaa faujadaari maamle kii tulana main zyada aasaan hota he
 Conviction in a civil case is guided by the principle of 'multiplicity of evidence', while in a criminal case, proving guilty depends on 'evidence beyond reasonable doubt'
 gupta ke vakil gairi naftalis hameshaa chaahate the ki maamle kii sunwaayee sangheey adaalat main ho
 On April 12, Naftalis stated in an SEC court, "gupta is the only accused in the Gallione (rajaratnam's company name) case who has been denied the right to be heard before a jury and the significant protection available only in federal court
" 
 '' gupta kaa bachaav kar rahi team kaa maananaa he ki maamla itnaa damdaar nahin he ki usamen tarkpurna andeh se pare saakshyon ke aadhaar par dosha siddh kiya ja sake
 The SEC dismissed the civil case in August
 do maah baad rajaratnam ko sajaa sunaae jane se utsahit neuyork ke dakshini jile kii america abhiyojak, ferozepur kii janmi 43 varshiya preet bharaara ne faujadaari maamla dayera karne kaa faisla kiya
 Bharara, who is fighting for the cleanliness of Wall Street immediately after Gupta's arrest, said that Gupta Rajaratnam had "illegal eyes and ears
" ''gupta ke khilaaf maamla majboot paristhiti-janya sabooton par aadhaarit he, par puri tarah pukhta nahin he
 Prosecutors are relying on Gupta's phone records, which reveal that Gupta had called Rajaratnam more than once after making a conference call with Goldman Sachs board of directors more than once
 gupta tab (2008 main) board ke sadsy the
 On one such occasion, it is alleged, Gupta has paid $ 5 billion (rs 25,000 crore) by Warren Buffet at Goldman Sachs
 ) nivesh karne kii khabar apane dost rajaratnam ko de di, jisane turant acchhee-khaasi sankhya main goldman sex ke share kharid liye or baffe ke nivesh kii jaankaree saarvajanik ho jane ke baad mote munaafe main bech die
 "his desire to give Rajaratnam the inside information is clearly revealed by two incidents in which he is just in the midst of getting critical information from Goldman Sachs and providing it to his good friend," Janice Federsaik, assistant director in charge of the FBI, said in a statement
 See 39 seconds
 ''gupta ke paksh main yah baat jaati he ki baffe ke nivesh ke bare main hui baatcheet ko tepe nahin kiya gaya tha
 The prosecutor's argument is based on extracting phone records and the business activities of Rajaratnam
 ho saktaa he, yah juri ko kaayal karne ke liye kaaphi na ho
 Another evidence is a taped conversation in October 2008, in which Rajaratnam tells an employee that "a member of the board of Goldman Sachs has told him that the investment bank will pay $ 2 per share (rs 100)
" ) kaa nuksaan uthaane ja rahaa he
 "gupta's name has not been taken in this conversation and it is unlikely to be considered as evidence based on hearsay
" abhiyojan paksh ne abhi tak yah ujagar nahin kiya he ki kya uske paas is tarah kaa koi saboot he ki rajaratnam ko khabar dene se gupta ko vittiya phayda hua ho
 Rajaratnam recently revealed in an interview to Newsweek that officials were searching for more evidence against Gupta and were spending more than the amount spent in the Gelione case
 rajaratnam ke mutabik, abhiyojkon ne use sajaa sunaae jane ke do hafte pehle tak uske saath sauda karne kii koshish kii thi
 He could have given evidence against Gupta and in return his sentence would have been reduced to perhaps five years, though he was eventually sentenced to 11 years
 rajaratnam ne intervyuu main kaha, ''ve mujhse pli bargen karnaa chaahate the
 They want to trap Rajat
 main vah nahin karne vaala, jo logon ne mere saath kiya he
 Rajat has four daughters
 ''rajaratnam ko teen logon kii madad se doshi sabit kiya ja sakaa
 All of them were his friends, and became official witnesses
 inamen uske purv karmchaaree rumi khan, makkinji kaa purv bhagidaar anil kumaar or intel kaa purv kaaryakari rajeev goyal shaamil hai
 Saddened by the behavior of these people, whom he considers to be traitors, Rajaratnam has at the moment refused to do the same thing with his friend Rajat
 gupta ke vakil naftalis ko aakhirkaar manamafik kanoonee manch mil gaya he
 He showed confidence in his client after his bail
 ek bayaan main unhone kaha, ''is maamle ke tathy darshaate hai ki gupta sabhi aaropon main bekasoor hai, or unhone hameshaa eemaandaaree or satyanishtha ke saath kaam kiya he
 "the real challenge before him will probably be to convince the jury in the global financial crisis and subsequent deep recession in a country that is angry with Wall Street's tricks and suspicious of the integrity of the top corporate nawabs
" mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii chaar divasiy japan yatra par tanj kasate hue mangalvaar ko argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki mukhyamantri japan main 'lav in tokyo' kar rahe hai
 Regarding this same attack of Tejashwi, JDU has said that such statements do not matter to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 jadyu pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha ki aise bayaan dene se bihar kii janata ko tejasvi ke bare main pataa chal rahaa he ki nechar or signechar kabhi nahin badalata he
 Sanjay Singh said that with such statements, Tejashwi Yadav has made it clear what he would have done there if he had gone to Japan
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki tejasvi kii kunthit maansikta japan jane kaa sapana dekhati he lekin vahaan jaakar vah kya karte vah khud tejasvi apane shabdon se bayaan kar rahe hai
 JDU said that it is not that the people of Bihar did not give opportunity to Tejashwi Yadav, but also made him the watchman of Bihar, but that watchman filled the house by treasuring the state
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki aisi chori-dakaiti karne vaale parivaar ko satta se dur rakhana chahie
 The JDU spokesperson said that those who eat animal feed should not talk about morality

 The JDU said that the people of Bihar had defeated the RJD alliance in 2005 and proved that the days of casteism and misogyny are over and in 2015 too, the RJD coalition is only in power due to the face of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar

 Call it a game of luck or the consequences of Tejpal's actions, till yesterday, Tejpal, who played in lakhs, is now being accused of the Goa Police and is forced to face the questions of the police in the dark and dirty lockup
 do dinon tak chali lambii bahes ke baad shanivaar kii raat ko jaise hi panaji kii seshan court ne tejpal kii zamaanat kii arzi khaarij kii, tejpal kii takadir main halaavat kaa pataa chaspa ho gaya
 IO Sunita Sawant, who is investigating the ongoing sexual exploitation case against Tejpal after Adalati Khanapuri, spent the night with the accused in the murder, the Tejpal already present there was arrested and after that his lawyer and They were separated from family members
 lekin iske baad tejpal kii asli musiibat tab shuru hui, jab unhone panaji police ke us hawalat main band kiya gaya, jahaan qatl ke do mulzimon samet pehle se hi teen log band the
 Tejpal got permission to wear the cloth sent from home on the court's order, but Tejpal's night was arguably the toughest night in his entire life with the accused of other serious crimes
 der raat takreeban saadhe 12 baje tejpal ko goa medical college aspataal main medical jaanch ke liye le jaaya gaya
 In addition to routine checkup, Tejpal's blog sugar was checked and ECG was also done
 or phir takreeban dedh ghante baad raat ko 2 baje tejpal ko lekar police waapas halaavat main lauti
 Apparently, Tejpal's first night in the lockup went out in the eye
 tejpal kii is haalat ko dekh kar ye aasaani se samajha ja saktaa he ki itane dinon se akhir ve giraftaar se bachane kii koshish kyon kar rahe the? ye yahi he ki adaalat ne giraftaar ke in dinon main bhi tejpal ko apane vakil or gharavaalon se kuch vaqt ke liye milane kii azaadi de rakhi he, lekin haqiqat yahi he ki ek baar police kii giraft main aane ke baad unki tamaam azaadi chhin gai he or ab tejpal ke liye vardiwaalon kaa hukum bajaane ke sivaay philhal or koi chaara nahin he
 Tejpaltejpal tried hard to avoid arrest, but could not escape his arrest
 vajah ye tejpal par laga ilzaam naa sirf behad sangeen tha, balki shuruaati tafteesh ke aaine main hi tejpal gunahagaar nazar aa rahe the
 Therefore, the court rejected every argument given by Tejpal in the matter of his freedom and ultimately the same happened, due to which fear of Tejpal's sleep and day was disturbed
 bekaar gayi tejpal kii daleelein- yon shoshan ke ilzaam se ghire tejpal ne kaha ki ye unke khilaaf siyaasi saazish he, lekin court ne nahin mana
 - Tejpal said that the delay in writing the report raises questions on the girl, but the court did not accept
 - tejpal ne kaha ki unhone vaisaa kuch kiya hi nahin, jaisaa ladki kah rahi he, lekin court ne nahin mana
 - Tejpal said that this strictness is excessive, but the court did not accept
 jaanate hai kyon? kyonki tejpal par jo ilzaam tha, uske aage ye tamaam daleelein fail ho gai
 The court might have paid attention to Tejpal's pleas, but not only did the girl come out and open all the bars of Tejpal, but the circumstances and evidence also point towards Tejpal's crime, Tejpal's advance bail in front of the court There was no option but to reject the application
 panaji ke isi seshan court ke darvaaze par patrkaar tarun tejpal jitani ummid ke saath pahunche the, yahaan se unhen utana hi noummid hokar lautnaa padaa
 And for the same reasons, despite all his efforts, arguments, pleas and long trial he finally had to arrest him
 seshan court kii jaj anuja prabhudesai ne tejpal kii yachika khaarij karte hue apane aadesh main jo baaten likhin, use pard kar ye saafe ho jaataa he ki tejpal ke liye aanevaale din or bhi zyaada mushkilon bhare hai
 The judge said, "delay in writing the report of sexual abuse cannot be a criterion for giving benefit to the accused in such a case
" kyonki yon shoshan or balaatkaar jaisi kisi bhi vaardaat kaa shikaar hone ke baad peedit ladki jo jitna jismani or jehani sadma lagata he, usase oobarne main kisi ko bhi lanbaa vaqt lag saktaa he
 Therefore, this argument of the defense cannot be given due consideration
 'jaj ne aage kaha, 'pehali nazar main ladki kii taraf se lagaae gaye ilzaam naa sirf sahi lagate hai, balki uske doston kii gavaahi, sisitivi footage, tejpal or ladki ke i-mels jaise subut bhi hamen bachaav paksh kii daleelon se mutmain hone kaa mauka nahin dete hai
 Misdemeanors are charged under sections 354-A and 376 (2) (k) of the IPC and are possible from seven years to the full term
 'ant main adaalat ne tejpal ko ek rasukhdaar shaks maanate hue ye kaha ki chunki mulzim ne pehle bhi ladki ke gharavaalon ko is maamle se peeche hatane ke liye dabaav daalane kii koshish kii, is maamle main tejpal kii zamaanat arzi ko kubul karnaa mumkin he
 So, this application is rejected right now and right now
 do guzaarishon ko adaalat ne darkinar kar diyado dinon main tejpal kii do guzaarishon ko adaalat ne darkinar kar diya
 The first request was for anticipatory bail, while the second request was for no police remand
 
 
 kyonki police adaalat ko ye samajhane main kaamyaab rahi ki rasukhdaar tejpal ke seene main yon shoshan kii vaardaat se jude abhi bhi kai aise raaj dafn hai, jo qaayade se poochtacha karne par hi baahar aa sakate hai
 It is said that a person follows what he runs away from
 
 
 tejpal giraftaar se bhaag rahe the
 
 
 Were getting nervous 
 
 lekin naa sirf giraftaar ho gaye, balki giraftaar ke baad remand kii surat main chah dinon ke liye sidhe police ke shikanje main bhi pahunch gaye
 Now the police will try to get a single account of the physical vigor made by the reporter who worked under his own during Tehelka's Think Fest in Goa
 tarun tejpal ko court ne 6 dinon kii police remand par bhejavaise to shanivaar ko tejpal kii giraftaar ke saath hi unke is anjaam kaa ahsaas hone laga tha, lekin police or kanoonee prakriyaaon ne ise ek din ke liye or aage khiskaa diya
 During the hearing of Tejpal's anticipatory bail application, the police had expressed their intentions by seeking their remand for 14 days
 jo ek din baad yani ravivaar ko akhirkaar amal main aa hi gaya
 On Sunday morning, Goa police reached Tejpal on a holly-day court at eleven o'clock forty minutes
 chunki ravivaar chuttee kaa din he, ye court aise hi chuninda maamalon kii sunwaayee ke liye baithi thi
 The police, as on Saturday, termed Tejpal's crime as a grave and requested the court to hand him on remand for 14 days so that he can be questioned by Tafsil
 police ne kaha, 'tejpal par laga ilzaam behad sangeen he or aise maamle kii tafteesh ke liye mulzim ko remand par lenaa behad zaruri he
 Since the crime of Tejpal has been cleared in the initial investigation itself
 aage kii tafteesh main baaki kadiyon ko jodna abhi baaki he
 Tejpal has already committed Iqbal-e-crime through his email
 phir hotel ke sisitivi footage bhi tejpal ke khilaaf ek pukhta subut he
 On the other hand, the statement given by the girl before the magistrate under Section 164 of crpc, her statement is also going to match with the investigation
 aise main is rasukhdaar mulzim se poochtacha kar jald se jald tamaam subut jutanaa zaruri he
 On the other hand, in the court, Tejpal's lawyers, ie the defense, protested against being given him on remand
 tejpal ke vakeelon kaa kahana tha, 'is maamle main tejpal shuru se hi police or kaanoon kaa saath de rahe hai
 Since coming to Goa until his arrest, he has been constantly appearing on his own and going to the police and is a responsible person who believes in laws and is a well-known journalist
 aise main unhen alag se remand par lekar poochtacha karne kii koi zarurat nahin he
 But, after hearing arguments on both sides, the court handed over Tejpal on police remand for six days
 ab police unase poochtacha ke alaava unhen un tamaam jagahon par bhi le jaaegi, jahaan se is vaardaat kaa koi vaasta rahaa he

 The police is trying to find out whether it was just a few minutes of anger or if there is some old reason for the dispute between the husband and wife

 The winning team in the first qualifier will get straight into the finals but the losing team will get a second chance to make it to the finals
 vah iske liye pehle alimineter main haarane vaali team ke saath duusare kwalifire main do-do haath karegi
 In this sense, Mumbai Indians and Super Kings have two chances to make it to the finals but neither of these teams will want to have a second chance and will take the opportunity to enter the final
 is lihaaj se yah muqabla aar yaa paar kaa hoga
 The first qualifiers and first eliminators were to be held in Chennai as per the pre-scheduled schedule but due to the political opposition of Sri Lankan players to play in Chennai, the organizing committee decided to shift these matches to Delhi
 pehle alimineter main rajasthan royles kaa saamana sunrisers hyderabad ke saath hoga
 Rajasthan and Sunrisers have made it to the playoff round with 20-20 points while Super Kings and Mumbai Indians have scored 22-22 points at the league level

 For the Delhi cricket fans, playing two playoff matches in Kotla is a gift and there is no doubt that they will get to see interesting competition as it will be between two teams which are also powerful and strategically successful

 In that match the Super Kings were dismissed for a total of 79 runs
 yah ipel-6 main unka nunatam score he
 The Mumbai Indians team, playing under the captaincy of Rohit Sharma, would like to take advantage of this psychological advantage, while the Super Kings giants would like to stop it from doing so
 is match main jeetne vaali team 26 may ko eden gardens stadium main hone vaala ipel-6 kaa final muqabla khelegi
 At the same time, the losing team will get another opportunity to reach the final

 She will do it for the second qualifier with the losing team in the first eliminator

 The Committee of Administrators, in its letter, has also told the three office bearers, citing the decision of the Supreme Court, "the board officials will work under the supervision and control of the Committee of Administrators
 " yahi nahin apane khat main unhone siio rahul johari ko nirdesh dete hue likhaa he "saare anubandh / nivida jinka mulya 25 lakh rupee se zyada hoga wo siio ke zarie hi prashaskon kii samiti ke paas sweekruti ke liye laayaa jayega

 In order to avoid an attack like the 'suit boot ki sarkar' from the opposition again, the government has quickly shown in the case of Jio Institute that it has got a letter of intent, not just a 'tag' of excellence
 
 sarkaar kaa yah bhi kahana he ki jeeyo kaa prastaav ek visheshgy samiti dwaara tay guideline ke mutabik tha, isliye use manjuuri di gai
 The government has said that if the Reliance Foundation does not implement its declared proposals after three years, then this 'degree' (of the Institute of Eminence) can be withdrawn from it

 An HRD official said, "the qualification criteria for qualifying to get the tag of Institute of Eminence was very tough
 pehle ke vipareet is baar iske liye bani samiti main teen prakhyat logon ko shaamil kiya gaya tha

 a member of the expert committee said, "one of the conditions for the applying institute was that it should have the funds to run the institute itself and not be dependent on any sponsor
" kai aise maamle khaarij kiye gaye hai jinamenound transfarka koi vivaad tha yaa vitt mantralay ke samaksh tex kaa masalaa lambit tha

 Seeing a small incident happened in Saharanpur, it became canker
 kya vajah he ki kai hafton se saharanpur dadhak rahaa he? aakhir kaise baari force ke baavjood bhi saharanpur main hinsa bhadakti rahi? kyon updravi kanoon kii dhajjiyaan udaate rahe?uttar pradesh ke grih sachiv ne bhi mana he ki saharanpur ke tanaav ke peeche police or prashasan kii chook he
 In the eyes of everyone, the question is: how and why did water rise up in Saharanpur? What were the mistakes that, if corrected in time, the two communities would not have been divided so badly and violence would not have taken place? The administration wanted to install the statue of Ambedkar at the Ravidas temple in the Dalit community Ravidas village in Shabbirpur village, not far from Kothasaharanpur city
 sabase pehali galati tab hui jab police ne pratimaa lagane par pratibandh laga diya lekin dalit samudaay ko vishwaas main nahin liya
 The administration neither gave any reason for saying no nor suggested any way forward, due to which there was resentment among the Dalit community
 prashasan par bhedbhaav kaa aarope5 may ko maharana pratap jayanti par shabbirpur gaanv se 11 kilometre dur shimlana gaanv ja rahe thakur samudaay ke logon ne bina anumati ke juluus nikaala
 When the youth of 25-30 Thakur community came out of Shabbirpur village with Tej Music and DJ, people objected to Tej Baje
 dalit samudaay ke log or bhadak gaye
 They felt that the administration was discriminating against them
 prashasan ne sakhti dikhaai hoti to naa ye jaloos nikalataa naa hi patharbaji or hinsa hoti
 One died in that incident and more than two dozen people were injured
 saharanpur main badalati paristhitiyon ko aankane main galatiuttar pradesh ke dijipi khud 8 may ko saharanpur gaye or waapas laut bole kii halaat saamaanya he
 It is evident that somewhere, the DGP, the top officials posted in Saharanpur, underestimated the critical situations
 sutron ke mutabik dijipi ko bhim army kii harkaton or do samudaay ke bich badhate tanaav kii sahi tasviir nahin mili
 This is the reason that a day after that there was violence again in Saharanpur
 lachar prashasan ke chalate dangaiyon ke hausale badhemauka bhaanpate hue 9 may ko bhim army ne daliton par ho rahe atyaachaar par saharanpur main mahapanchayat bulaai
 The arbitrary movement of the Bhima Army continued and the administration remained a mute spectator
 saharanpur main baari force hone ke baavjood bhi police kii ankhon ke saamne updravi kanoon vyavastha kii dhajjiyaan udaate rahe
 Not taking drastic action on many rioters from the head of Bhima Army was a major failure of the police
 mayawati kii sabha ko anumatipurani galatiyon se sabak naa lete hue prashasan kii mayawati ko shabbirpur gaanv main sabha kii anumati dena ek or baari chook thi
 According to the Intelligence Department report, there was a possibility of rioting due to Mayawati's arrival
 iske baavjood bhi mayawati ko sabha karne kii anumati di gai
 At the same time, despite the heavy presence of RAF and PAC, all the officials including DM, SSP failed to prevent the situation from deteriorating
 soshal media kaa hathiyaarashgaranpur kii aag main soshal media ne ghi daalane kaa kaam kiya
 The administration was unaware of the rumored market, a hate campaign on social media for over a month
 jabaki bhim army ne bheed ikaitha karne se lekar sanghathan ke liye aarthik madad maangane ke liye soshal media kaa jabardast sahaara liya
 Surprisingly, it took weeks for the administration to ban this dangerous weapon
 25 may ko sahraanpur main soshal media kii sevaayen radd kii gai

 The Chinese newspaper has not only advised India to learn from this, but has also threatened that India should understand that China is the second largest economy in the world
 aise main china ke saath yuddh karne se bharat kaa vikaas prabhavit hoga
 It also said that the Trump administration has not given much consideration to the us-india relationship

 China cannot stop protecting its territory because of the interference of the US

 It is good that farmers in Jaipur are expressing their opposition in a non-violent and constructive manner
 kisaanon kii duniya main bahut kuch ho rahaa he jise ham dilli main baithkar nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 His inner knee is coming out of various paths
 sarkaar ko bhi kisaanon kii bechaini ko samajhnaa chahie or samvaad kaayam karnaa chahie
 What are the farmers doing nothing to make their voice heard? behatar he sunanaa shuru kar dena chahie ki ve kya kah rahe hai
 In Jaipur, farmers have dug a pit in the ground and stood up
 kisne sochaa tha ki gandhi kii ahimsa desh kii janata ko iti cell par nirbhar raajnneetik dalon se bhi zyada rachanaatmak bana degi
 The name of this movement is Samadhi Satyagraha
 jal samadhi ke baad zamin samadhi
 This satyagraha has been going on since October 2
 mahilaayein bhi saath ai hai
 The Jaipur Development Authority took over 1150 bighas of these farmers in 2010
 usee saal se ye kisaan zamin kaa daam lene ke liye pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Till date the price has not been received
 2000 kisaanon kii zamin chali gai
 The first news of Dainik Bhaskar of October 4 was screaming that even after the Mandsaur incident, the police had not learned anything
 akhbaar kah rahaa he ki tikamgarh main kisaanon ko dauda-dauda kar peeta
 Clothes were taken off in the police station and 30 farmers were injured
 kisaanon kii galati ye thi ki ve gyaapan dene ke liye jiladhikari se milanaa chaahate the
 The comments kahin kisaan zehar se mar rahaa he to kahin dauda-dauda kar maaraa ja rahaa he
 Farmers allege that they were made to sit in lockup for hours
 rajya ke grahamantri ne jaanch ke aadesh de die hai
 The Collector of Tikamgarh says that not a single farmer has been injured
 agar unke kapade utaravaaye gaye hai to jaanch hogi
 The administration says that there was stone-pelting on behalf of farmers and Congress workers, which led to the lathi charge
 ye patharbazi vaala udhaaharan biechayu ke samay bhi vahaan ke vaais chancelar ne diya tha jinhen chuttee par bhej diya gaya he
 This movement was led by Congress leader Ajay Singh
 congress ke aahvaan par hi kisaanon ne andolan kiya tha
 The Congress is demanding that Tikamgarh be declared drought-prone
 mukhyamantri shivaraj singh ne kaha he ki ve hinsak pradarshan bardaasht nahin karenge
 Accusing the Congress of creating instability
 kisaanon kii maang he tikamgarh ko suukhaagrast zila ghoshit kiya jaae
 The Collector had taken the memorandum from the Congress leaders
 rajya ke mantri kaa kahana he ki kisaanon ko nahin peeta gaya, congressiyon ko peeta gaya
 This is the trick of Congress
 anuraag dwari ne rajya ke grahamantri or congress netaa se bhi baat kii he
 Now the Maharashtra government has constituted a high level committee and started the investigation
 faisla hua he ki chhidkaav ke dauraan istemaal ke liye muft main dastaane or mosk die jaaenge or mritak pariwaron ko do lakh rupee die jaaenge
 In 2010, a storm hour report was made in Bhiwani about how farmers do not know and spray without full protection and poison enters their bodies
 chunki ye khetihar mazdoor hote hai or duusare rajya se aae hote hai to inaki maut kii thik se reporting bhi nahin hoti or na hi aankade rakhe jate hai
 Otherwise it would be known how many farmers die due to spraying of pesticides
 bhivani ke aspataalon ke baahar likhaa hota tha ki hamaare yahaan spray ke marizon kaa ilaaj hota he
 i wish that something would have saved many farmers
 buudhvaar ko jab rajya ke krishi mantri yavatmal gaye to kisaanon ne isi spray mashin se un par sankethik chhidkaav kiya or apni naaraazgi zaahir kii
 According to different media reports, the number of farmers hospitalized is different
 koi 300 likh rahaa he koi 400 or koi 700 likh rahaa he
 There are crowds of farmers in hospitals
 jinhen kheton main hona chahie tha wo ab zindagi se lard rahe hai
 The incident kept happening but no one pressed the alarm button
 kaha ja rahaa he ki krishi vibhaag or kitnashak companiyon ne kisaano ko thik se aagaah nahin kiya
 Nothing happens to them anyway, do big companies ever get punished
 kisaan sanghathan to kisaanon ke liye das lakh muawza maang rahe hai
 Got 2 lakh rupees
 kisaanon ke sankat par nazar rakhane ke liye maharashtra sarkaar ne vasantrao nike shetakari swaavlamban mishan banaaya he
 Kishore Tiwari, a member of this task force, warned a month ago that Bt cotton is no longer free from pesticide attacks
 lihaaza bade paimaane par kitnashkon ke istamaal hone kaa khatara he
 In Sikar, Rajasthan, the farmers held a non-violent protest for several days in which people from the district businessman and others also supported the farmers
 sikar kaa andolan karz maafee ke vaade ke saath khatm ho gaya
 Now another agitation of farmers is grabbing people's attention
 acchhee baat he ki jaipur main bhi kisaan ahimsak or rachanaatmak tareeke se apana virodh zaahir kar rahe hai
 a lot is happening in the world of farmers, which we are unable to understand while sitting in Delhi
 unke bheetar kii ghutan tarah-tarah ke raaston se baahar aa rahi he
 The government should also understand the uneasiness of the farmers and establish dialogue
 kisaan apni awaz sunaane ke liye kya kuch nahin kar rahe hai
 It is better to start listening to what they are saying
 jaipur main kisaan zamin main gaddha khod kar khadey ho gaye hai
 Who thought that Gandhi's non-violence would make the people of the country more creative than the political parties dependent on IT cell
 is andolan kaa naam he samadhi satyagrah
 Land tomb after water tomb
 do aktubar se yah satyagrah chal rahaa he
 Women have also come along
 in kisaanon kii 1150 bigha zamin jaipur vikaas praadhikaran ne 2010 main le lee thi
 Since the same year, these farmers have been demonstrating for the price of the land
 aaj tak daam nahin mila he
 2000 farmers lost their land
 4 aktubar ke dainik bhaskar kii yah pehali khabar cheekh kar bataa rahi thi ki mandsaur kii ghatana ke baad bhi police ne kuch nahin siikhaa he
 The newspaper is saying that farmers in Tikamgarh ran and beat them
 thane main band kar kapade utaravaaye or 30 kisaan ghayal hue hai
 The farmers' mistake was that they wanted to meet the District Magistrate to give the memorandum
 tippaniyan Somewhere the farmer is dying of poison and somewhere he is being run and killed
 kisaanon kaa aarope he ki unhen lowep main kapade utarava kar ghanton bithaaya gaya
 The State Home Minister has ordered an inquiry
 tikamgarh ke colector kaa kahana he ki ek bhi kisaan ghayal nahin hua he
 If their clothes are stripped off then there will be an investigation
 prashasan kaa kahana he ki kisaan or congress kaaryakartaaon kii taraf se patharbazi hui jisaki vajah se lathi charge hua
 This stoning example was given during the time of BHU also by the Vice Chancellor who has been sent on leave
 is andolan kaa netritv congress netaa ajay singh kar rahe the
 The farmers agitated on the call of Congress
 congress tikamgarh ko suukhaagrast ghoshit karne kii maang kar rahi he
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh has said that he will not tolerate violent demonstrations
 congress par asthirataa paidaa karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Farmers demand that Tikamgarh be declared a drought-prone district
 colector ne congress netaaon se gyaapan le liya tha
 The Minister of State says that farmers were not beaten, Congressmen were beaten
 ye congress kii chaal he
 Anurag Dwari has also spoken to the state Home Minister and Congress leader
 2010 main bhivani main ek aandhe ghante kii report banaai thi ki kis tarah kisaanon ko jaankaree nahin hoti he or ve bagair puri suraksha ke spray karne lagate hai or unke sharir main zehar pravesh kar jaataa he
 Since these are agricultural laborers and have come from other states, there is no proper reporting of their deaths nor statistics are maintained
 varna pataa chalata ki kitnashkon ke chhidkaav ke kaaran kitne kisaanon kii maut hoti he
 Outside the hospitals of Bhiwani, it used to be written that we treat spray patients here
 kaash ki kuch badalata, kitne kisaanon kii jaan batch jaati
 On Wednesday, when the state agriculture minister went to Yavatmal, farmers sprayed him with this spray machine and expressed their displeasure
 alag-alag media report ke anusaar, aspataal main bhartee kisaanon kii sankhya alag he
 Some are writing 300, some 400 and some 700
 aspataalon main kisaanon kii bheed he
 Those who should have been in the fields are now fighting with life
 ghatana ghatati rahi magar kisi ne alarm batan nahin dabaaya
 It is being said that the agriculture department and pesticide companies did not properly warn the farmers
 inkaa vaise bhi kuch nahin hona, kabhi badi companiyon ko sazaa hoti he kya
 Farmers' organizations are demanding one million compensation for the farmers
 mila 2 lakh rupee he
 The Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission has been created by the Maharashtra government to keep an eye on the farmers' crisis
 is task force ke sadsy kishor tiwari ne maheenaa bhar pehle chetavanee de di thi ki beati coton ab kitnashkon ke hamale se mukt nahin rahaa
 Therefore, there is a danger of pesticide use on a large scale
 rajasthan ke sikar main kisaanon ne kai dinon tak ahimsak pradarshan kiya jisamen zile ke vyapaaree se lekar duusare logon ne bhi kisaanon kaa saath diya
 Sikar's movement came to an end with the promise of loan waiver
 ab kisaanon kaa ek or andolan logon kaa dhyaan khinch rahaa he
 It is good that farmers in Jaipur are expressing their opposition in a non-violent and constructive manner
 kisaanon kii duniya main bahut kuch ho rahaa he jise ham dilli main baithkar nahin samaj paa rahe hai
 His inner knee is coming out of various paths
 sarkaar ko bhi kisaanon kii bechaini ko samajhnaa chahie or samvaad kaayam karnaa chahie

 akhbaar kah rahaa he ki tikamgarh main kisaanon ko dauda-dauda kar peeta
 Clothes were taken off in the police station and 30 farmers were injured
 kisaanon kii galati ye thi ki ve gyaapan dene ke liye jiladhikari se milanaa chaahate the
 The comments kahin kisaan zehar se mar rahaa he to kahin dauda-dauda kar maaraa ja rahaa he
 Farmers allege that they were made to sit in lockup for hours
 rajya ke grahamantri ne jaanch ke aadesh de die hai
 The Collector of Tikamgarh says that not a single farmer has been injured
 agar unke kapade utaravaaye gaye hai to jaanch hogi

 Accusing the Congress of creating instability
 kisaanon kii maang he tikamgarh ko suukhaagrast zila ghoshit kiya jaae
 The Collector had taken the memorandum from the Congress leaders
 rajya ke mantri kaa kahana he ki kisaanon ko nahin peeta gaya, congressiyon ko peeta gaya
 This is the trick of Congress
 anuraag dwari ne rajya ke grahamantri or congress netaa se bhi baat kii he
 Somewhere the farmer is dying of poison and somewhere he is being run and killed
 kisaanon kaa aarope he ki unhen lowep main kapade utarava kar ghanton bithaaya gaya
 The State Home Minister has ordered an inquiry
 tikamgarh ke colector kaa kahana he ki ek bhi kisaan ghayal nahin hua he
 If their clothes are stripped off then there will be an investigation
 prashasan kaa kahana he ki kisaan or congress kaaryakartaaon kii taraf se patharbazi hui jisaki vajah se lathi charge hua

 It's a masterstroke by the 'master of situation', @rahulgandhi - declaring # minimumincomeguarantee scheme
 It has rattled our people so much that some of our prominent people had to rush for a press conference, calling the whole declaration / announcement "chhal kapat"
 shatrughna sinha (shatrughan Sinha) ne twit kar rahul gandhi kii newsnatam aay yojana (MIGA) kii tarif karte hue kaha ki yah 'master of sichuation' rahul gandhi kaa masterstroke he
 He further wrote, "this plan has disturbed some of our important people and he immediately declared this announcement as a fraud and a press conference
" 'isse pehle bijepi kii ore se sabase varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani kaa gandhinagar se tikat katane par baagi saansad shatrughna sinha (shatrughan Sinha) bhi mukhar ho uthe hai
 Shatrughan Sinha reminded the BJP leadership that Newton's third law was that every action has a reaction

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has embarked on a strategy to snatch his traditional Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat from the SP
 isi kadi main unhone sapa ke nishad card ke jariye hi akhilesh yadav ko maat dene kii yojana ko amalijama pehanaanaa shuru kar diya he
 The family of Jamuna Prasad Nishad, who has always presented a challenge to Yogi as an MP, is preparing to say goodbye to the SP
 mana ja rahaa he ki divangat jamuna nishad kii patni or purv vidhayak rajmati nishad or unke bete amrendra nishad bijepi kaa daaman tham sakate hai
 This is considered a big blow for the SP
 vahiin, gorakhpur main ek baar phir bijepi ke liye camel khilne kii ummid banati dikh rahi he
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was in Gorakhpur on Tuesday
 is dauraan amrendra nishad ne siem yogi se shahar ke circuit house main mulaakaat kii
 Since then, political speculations are being made that Amarendra Nishad and his mother Rajmati Nishad have decided to leave the SP
 is baat ko amrendra nishad ne khud hi sweekaar kiya he
 However, Amarendra has not lost a leaf about joining the BJP
 lekin jis tarah se unhone siem yogi se mulaakaat kii he or nai vicharadhara ke saath judane kii baat kar rahe hai, usase saaf jaahir he unka aglaa siyaasi thikaana kahaan he
 In fact, in the SP-BSP alliance, the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat has gone to the sp's account
 gorakhpur sansadeey seat par bijepi kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 Neither the bsp's social engineering work nor the sp's socialism has worked here for the last three decades
 lekin 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad jab bijepi ne satta kii kaman yogi adityanath ko saunpi to unhone is seat se loksabhaa sadsyta se istipha de diya
 Subsequently, in the by-elections held in 2018, the SP had the National President of the Nishad Party, Dr
 sanjay nishad ke bete praveen nishad ko tikat diya
 In the Gorakhpur by-election, the SP got the support of the BSP and Pravin Nishad snatched away this traditional BJP seat
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii siyaasi bisaat bichaai jane lagi he
 In such a situation, the ticket of Pravin Nishad on this seat from SP is being confirmed
 aise main jamuna prasad nishad kaa parivaar apane siyaasi vajood ko bachaae rakhane ke kii koshishon main jute gaya
 Recently, Amarendra Nishad and his mother Rajmati Nishad held a meeting with their supporters and expressed their intention to contest the Lok Sabha elections
 is baat kii jaise hi bhanak yogi adityanath ko lagi to jamuna nishad ke parivaar se apane siyaasi dushmani ko bhulaakar unhen apane kheme main laane kii kavayad shuru kar di
 According to sources, under this link Amarendra Nishad has met Yogi Adityanath
 mana ja rahaa he ki unhone bijepi main entry kii hari jhandi de di he
 Interestingly, in Gorakhpur, Jamuna Prasad Nishad had been giving the biggest challenge to Yogi Adityanath so far
 ek baar to yogi ko unke saamne jeetne main paseene chhot gaye the or mahaj kareeb 7 hajaar vot se hi jeet sake the
 After the death of Jamuna Prasad, his wife Rajmati Nishad became an MLA on a SP ticket from Pipraich
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa ne yogi adityanath ke khilaaf rajmati nishad pratyaashee banaaya tha
 But she could not win
 2017 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main sapa ne rajmati ke bete amrendra nishad ko piparich seat se maidan main utaara tha, lekin wo jeet nahin sake

 Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan responded to this after the Pulwama terror attack and said that India has blamed Pakistan for the attack without any evidence
 unhone kaha ki agar bharat ke paas pakistan ke khilaaf koi saboot hai to vah hamen saunpe, hamaari sarkaar guarantee se us par karrwai karegi
 In response, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti has advocated giving an opportunity to Imran Khan
 mahabuuba mufti ne imran ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue twit kiya, 'asahmat, pathankot kaa dogier inako saunpa gaya tha
 But no action was taken to punish the culprits
 lekin pakistan ke pradhanmantri ko ek mauka milanaa chahie kyonki vah chunakar aae hai
 Apparently, the war slogans are being given only for the upcoming election, they have no more meaning than this
 'disagree
 Pathankot dossier was given to them but no action was taken to punish the perpetrators
 Time to walk the talk
 But Pak PM deserves a chance since he's recently taken over
 Of course the war rhetoric has more to do with the impending elections than anything else
 https: / / t
 co / qioxkzusth— Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti)february 19, 2019bataa den ki bharat isse pehle bhi pakistan ko kai baar aatanki hamalon ke baad saboot de chukaa he
 Be it Uri attack or terrorist attack on Pathankot airbase
 lekin pakistan ne ek baar bhi aatank ke khilaaf koi ection nahin liya, balki apni jameen ko aatankiyon kii panaahagaah banane diya
 The responsibility of the Pulwama attack has also been taken by the Pakistani terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammad, whose leader Maulana Masood Azhar is roaming freely in Pakistan
 iske alaava mumbai aatanki hamale kaa master mind or lashkar sargana hafiz said ke khilaaf bhi kai baar saboot pakistan ko saunpe ja chuke hai, lekin us par bhi pakistan kii ore se koi karrwai nahin kii gai he
 What was Imran's statement: Pakistan's PM Imran said in his statement that if India gives evidence of jaish-e-mohammed's involvement in the Pulwama attack, then he is ready to take action
 bharat bina kisi saboot ke pakistan par aarope laga rahaa he
 He claimed that there is no room for panic in the new Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki pakistan khud aatankwaad kaa sabase bada shikaar rahaa he or aatankwaad kii vajah se desh ke 70,000 log apni jaan ganvaa chuke hai
 Imran said that whenever he raises the issue of negotiation, India puts the condition of negotiating terrorism first
 ham baatcheet ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin bharat ko yah dekhnaa hoga ki kashmir main kya ho rahaa he
 He said that general elections are coming in India, so an atmosphere of war is being created
 muslim mahilaon ko teen talaak se aazaadee dilaane kaa jo vaada pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kiya tha, use puraa karne kii disha main aaj yani guuruuvaar ko sarkaar ek or kadam uthaane ja rahi he

 With regard to the triple talaq bill, the talaq-e-biddat has been termed as a crime in the Talaqin Divorce Bill by speaking for three times together
 saath hi doshi ko jail kii sajaa sunaae jane kaa bhi praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 This part of the conviction of triple talaq remains a controversial issue
 isi ke chalate yah bill pichhali baar rajyasabha main paas nahin ho paaya tha
 Demand for sending it to the Standing Committee: Opposition parties have been demanding removal of this provision to bring the bill into parity with the Hindu and Christian marriage law
 congress, trinmul congress or diemke ise sthaayee samiti main bhejne kii maang kar rahi he
 Allied parties like JDU also have problems with certain provisions
 loksabhaa main paas to rajyasabha main atak saktaa he billbaharhaal, loksabhaa main sarkaar ko prachand bahumat he, isliye yahaan bill kii raah main koi baadha nahin he, lekin rajyasabha se manjuuri dilvaanaa sarkaar ke liye mushkil he
 The strength of the Rajya Sabha is not in favor of the government
 rajyasabha main pesh hoga artiai bilaaj hi rajyasabha main sarkaar kii ek or pariksha hogi
 The pass from Lok Sabha will be placed in the upper house to pass the RTI bill
 iske liye bhi bijepi ne teen linon kaa vip saansadon ko jari kiya he

 Chief Selector of BCCI Selection Committee M
 es
 K
 prasad ne kaha he ki vah rishabh pant ke vikalp ke taur par ishan kishan, sanju samson or anya wicketciparon par nigahen rakhe hue hai
 Please tell that Rishabh Pant is currently struggling with very poor form
 buudhvaar ko south africa ke khilaaf mohali main khele gaye duusare tii-20 match main pant number 4 par ballebaaji karne ke liye utre or sirf 4 ran banaakar out ho gaye
 Rishabh Pant's 69 runs came in the three-match T20 series on the West Indies tour last month, while he was able to score only 20 runs in the three-match ODI series
 kohli par gambhir kaa bada bayaan- dhoni or rohit kii vajah se chal rahi he captainimhendra singh dhoni ke antarrashtriya str par brake lene ke baad se pant team ke mukhya wicketiper ke taur par khel rahe hai, lekin vah lagaataar vifal ho rahe hai
 Prasad, however, believes that one needs to be patient with a talented player like Pant
 prasad ne angreji akhbaar indian express se kaha, 'maine pehle hi world cap ke baad kaha tha ki ham pant par najar rakhe hue hai
 We need to be patient with them, because they have a lot of talent
 'chif selector ne kaha, 'ham pant ke varchlod par bhi dhyaan de rahe hai
 Obviously, we are also keeping an eye on the options in all the three formats

 s
 bharat acha kar rahe hai hamaare paas kishan or samson hai jo simit overon main india-e ke liye or gharelu cricket main bhi acha kar rahe hai
 Coach Shastri also warned that in the last few matches, Rishabh Pant has failed to take advantage of the opportunities and the pressure on him to perform better is increasing
 rishabh pant ko lekar mukhya coach ravi shastri ne pehle hi saaf kar diya tha ki yah wicketiper ballebaaj apni galatiyon ko lagaataar nahin doharaa saktaa or agar aisa kiya to khamiyaja bhugatna hoga
 Team India head coach Ravi Shastri also said that if Rishabh Pant keeps repeating the mistakes made during the West Indies tour, then he will have to bear the brunt of it
 ganguli ne mana- in do khilaadiyon ke kaaran vanade team main bhi jagah ganvaa sakate hai keel rahulhaal hi main pant ko lekar shastri ne star sports se kaha tha, ‘yah bilkul saamaanya he
 Stop disappointing yourself
 aap team ko bhi niraash kar rahe hai
 When the captain is with you at the crease and you are chasing a goal, then you have to play cricket wisely
 ’ rishabh pant kai baar behuda shot khelkar apana wicket ganvaate aa rahe hai
 This has happened to him many times
 mahendra singh dhoni kaa uttaradhikari kahe ja rahe pant england or wales main khele gaye world cap main bhi zyada prabhaavshaalee nahin rahe the
 Sunil Gavaskar has given the former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar to give more and more opportunities to Rishabh Pant before the T20 World Cup to be held in Australia next year
 gavaskar ne kaha, ‘hamen ab mahendra singh dhoni se aage dekhne kii jarurat he
 At least my team does not include Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 agar aap tii-20 world cap ke bare main baat kar rahe ho to main nishchit rup se rishabh pant ke bare main sochoongaa
 Gavaskar said that if Pant does not do well then Sanju Samson will be the next best option
 unhone kaha, ‘agar mujhe ek anya vikalp kii jarurat hogi to main sanju samson ke bare main sochoongaa kyonki sanju ek acha wicketiper or ek acha ballebaaj he
 Dhoni is yet to announce his international retirement, but the current selection committee has already indicated that he does not want to look back
 haalanki pant nirantar acha pradarshan nahin kar paa rahe hai or unke kharaab shot chayan se team ko nuksaan ho rahaa he jaisaa ki mukhya coach ravi shastri ne haal hi main kaha tha

 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Wednesday that the Pakistan policy of the Narendra Modi government is 'inferior'
 unhone modi sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki vah desh ke logon se kiye gaye apane vaade puure karne main puri tarah naakaam rahi he
 Manmohan, who represented Assam in the Rajya Sabha for 10 years while addressing an election rally of the Congress, said, "the Modi government's policy on the issue of Pakistan is inferior
 pakistani aatankwaadiyon kaa sirf jammu-kashmir main hi aana jari nahin he, balki ve punjab evam anya padosi rajyon main bhi aa rahe hai
 The former Prime Minister said, "the recent attack on the Pathankot airbase is the latest evidence of our weakness
 ' Manmohan said, 'in these two years he (modi) has been able to achieve the same thing that he opened bank accounts of crores of people
 lekin log puch rahe hai ki jab unke paas bank main rakhane ke liye kuch he hi nahin to ve bank khaaton kaa karenge kya
 'the former Prime Minister said,' There is a saying in English that Karni's voice is louder than the voice
 baharhaal, aisa lagata he ki modi saarvajanik jivan kii is buniyadi baat ko bhul gaye hai
 He said that now efforts are being made to fool people by bringing non-essential issues as important issues
 unhone kaha, 'aarthik morche par, pichley do saal se krishi kshetra kaa vikaas thama padaa he, jisase bhartiya kisaanon ko bade paimaane par sankat kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Continuing the attack on Modi, Manmohan said that his foreign tours are being shown as a big achievement, but everyone knows that nothing has been achieved so far
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle videshi bainkon main bharatiyon kii ore se rakhe gaye kaale dhan waapas laane ke modi ke vaade kaa zikr karte hue congress netaa ne kaha ki durbhagyavash yah sarkaar bharat ke logon se kiye gaye vaade puure karne main buree tarah naakaam rahi he
 He said, the dream merchants are always selling this and their list of (modi's) promises is endless
 manmohan ne kaha, jab bhi assam kii kaman kisi gaiyr-congress party ko di gai to rajya ko kaaphi pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Appealing to the people of Assam to give a 'strong mandate' to the Congress, Manmohan said that with this the development in the state will touch new heights
 manmohan ne kaha ki desh main audyogic utpaadan thap pad gaya he, jisaki vajah se rojgaar main vruddhi ke koi sanket najar nahin aa rahe, jabaki pichley 15 maheene se niryaat girtaa hi chalaa ja rahaa he
 The former Prime Minister said that incidents at Hyderabad Central University and Jawaharlal Nehru University show that the Central Government is trying to curb freedom of expression and is trying to divide Indian polity on religious lines
 tippaniyan He said that the President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand exposes the Modi government's desire to harm democracy and is promoting centralization of power by violating constitutional norms
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 This is published directly from the Syndicate feed)
 manmohan ne kaha, 'in do saalon main vah (modi) ek hi cheez hasil kar paae hai ki unhone karodon logon ke bank khate khulavaa die
 But people are asking that when they do not have anything to keep in the bank, what will they do with the bank accounts
 ' purv pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'angreji main ek kahawat he ki kerani kii aawaaj kathani se zyada tej hoti he
 However, Modi seems to have forgotten this basic point of public life
 ' unhone kaha ki ab gaiyr-jaruri muddon ko ahm muddon ke taur par laakar logon ko bevakoof banane kii koshishen jaanboojhkar kii ja rahi hai
 He said, 'on the economic front, the development of the agricultural sector has come to a standstill for the last two years, due to which the Indian farmers are facing a big crisis
 ' modi par hamalaa jari rakhte hue manmohan ne kaha ki unke videsh dauron ko badi uplabdhi ke taur par dikhaaya ja rahaa he, lekin har koi jaanata he ki inase ab tak hasil kuch nahin hua he
 Referring to Modi's promise to bring back the black money held by Indians in foreign banks before the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress leader said that unfortunately this government has failed miserably to fulfill the promises made to the people of India
 unhone kaha, sapanom ke saudagar hameshaa yahi bechate rahete hai or unke (modi ke) vaadon kii fehrist antaheen he
 Manmohan said, whenever the command of Assam was given to a non-congress party, the state faced a lot of problems
 assam ke logon se congress ko 'majboot janadesh' dene kii apil karte hue manmohan ne kaha ki isse rajya main vikaas nai unchaaiyon ko chhuegaa
 Manmohan said that industrial production has come to a standstill in the country, due to which there are no signs of increase in employment, while exports have been falling for the last 15 months
 purv pradhanmantri ne kaha ki hyderabad kendriya vishvavidhyalay or jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay kii ghatnaayen dikhaati hai ki centre sarkaar abhivyakti kii aazaadee par lagaam lagane kii koshishen kar rahi he or bhartiya rajvyavastha ko dharmik aadhaar par baantne kii koshish kar rahi he

 instent miseging ap whatsapp ek aise feechar kii testing kar rahaa he jo yugers ke liye kaaphi phydemand sabit hone vaala he
 Many people use whatsapp Web
 agar ye feechar testing ke baad ke hakeekat banataa he to sabase zyada phayda un yugers ko hoga jo whatsapp computer par yuj karte hai
 Now you have to keep whatsapp active in mobile to use whatsapp Web and also need Internet in mobile
 lekin is feechar ke baad bina mobile main internet ke hi aap watsap web yuj kar sakate hai
 If mobile is off, you can still use whatsapp in your computer
 aane vaale samay main whatsapp main wo feechar bhi aa saktaa he jiske tahat ek saath ek se zyada divaais main whatsapp ko yuj kiya ja saktaa he
 At present, there is no such feature and whatsapp can be used on only one smartphone
 whatsapp multi plateform feechar laane vaala laane vaala he
 That is to say, whatsapp monitoring website wabetainfo
 whatsapp ek UWP naam ke ek feechar par bha kaam kar ha he
 Multi-platform features can be offered under Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
 whatsapp ke is feechar kii testing ke baar main hamane aapako pehle bhi bataaya tha, lekin ab company kii taraf se koi oficial jaankaree nahin mili he
 At present, there is no information from the company nor has it been confirmed that whatsapp is testing it
 wabetainfo kii is report main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki bhavishya main whatsapp main bhi fasebuk kaa infrastracchar yuj kiya ja saktaa he
 wabetainfo also has many roomers in this report and this website, which monitors the news of whatsapp, has shared a list saying that the features which they have confirmed earlier have now come
 to kya jald hi yugers ek acount ko alag alag divaais main yuj kar paaenge? Whistle blowers have a special place in the history of disagreements
 vah sangathit tantra kaa hi aadmi hota he or sanghathan chaahe kisi party, dharm yaa company kaa ho
 He is a person who, despite being loyal to his organization, is sensitive and uninterested in the complexities of life
 vah jaanata he ki koi bhi sanghathan hameshaa mandandon par khara utarane vaala trutiheen tantra nahin hota
 Tantra can corrupt in power, nepotism, careless ways

 He knows that taking his risks can restore the ideal

 Whistle blower is the name of one such anomaly, a dissenter within the bureaucracy, a bureaucrat with conscience
 apane sanghathan ko chunauti dete vakt darasal hamale, hatya, daman or nirvaasan ke prati vah apni kamajori ko bhi to udghaatit kar rahaa hota he
 He considers truth above consent and organizational loyalty

 Jindal is a professor at the Global University School of Government and Public Policy) rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ek aisa saanskrithik sanghathan he jo apane rashtrawaad ke liye janaa jaataa he to sampradayikta ke sawaal par virdohi use gherte bhi hai
 On Thursday, former President Pranab Mukherjee attended the Sangh program
 is par jamkar siyasat ho rahi he
 However, it is indeed a matter of pride for the RSS that Pranab da described its founder Hedgewar as the true son of Mother India
 itihaas ke pannon se, gulaami kii yaadon se, hindutv kii aasthaa se, bhartiyata kii bhaavana se, tilak ke prabhaav main or janamanas ke dabaav main 93 saal pehle ek sanghathan kaa janm hua
 At that time there were only 12 people, but today crores of people belong to the organization of that cultural nationalism
 wo raajnneeti se dur he lekin satta kii raajnneeti main wo taab nahin ki uske ishaaron ko nazarandaaj karke nikal jaae
 The identity of the Sangh is the leadership of Hindutva
 sangh kaa abhimaan hi hindu raashtra kii bhaawanaaon se judaa he
 The intention of the Sangh is for a united India
 sangh kaa vaada saanskrithik rashtrawaad ke pannon main bhatakta he, lekin bharat kaa dharmanirpeksh tanabana isi sangh se tamaam sawaal bhi poochta he
 That is why Pranab Mukherjee, who was in the Congress for his whole life, settled in the politics of nehru-indira, created a ruckus when he reached the headquarters of the Sangh, but now everyone has the idea which was expressed by Dada from the Sangh platform
 sangh kii saadagi or bhavyata ko ek saath anubhav karte hue purv raashtrapati ne aresas ke sansthaapak keshav baliram headgavar ko bharat mata kaa sachcha sapoot bataaya
 Pranab Mukherjee wrote in the visitor's book on Hedgewar's birthplace- Today i have come here to pay my respects and pay tribute to a great son of Mother India
 pranab mukherjeeka visitor book main likhaa bayaan aresas ke liye kisi uplabdhi se kam nahin he
 However, before this, Pranab Mukherjee also went to the building where Hedgewar's memories are preserved
 ye sahi he ki RSS ke kaaryakramon main pehle bhi alag vichaardhaara vaale log aate rahe hai
 During the days of slavery, Mahatma Gandhi himself went to a program and Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan, who fought for the second freedom struggle in independent India
 lekin pichley 25-30 varshon main badali desh kii raajnneeti or sangh ko lekar sikudte nazariye ke bich raashtrapati jaise shikhar ke pad ko sushobhit karne vaale pranab mukherjee kaa sangh kii tarif karnaa vaaki badi baat he
 Resham Bagh of Nagpur has a sound that has a large political meaning
 der-saber desh kii raajnneeti par wo dastak jarur degi
 While forming the RSS in 1925, Hedgewar had only 12 people
 lekin apane iraadon or manyataon main wo itane drudh the ki sangh ke abhi sau saal puure hue bhi nahin, lekin hindustan ke har kone main uski dhamak dikhti he
 When Pranab Mukherjee, who had a lot of differences on the same issues from the same association, reached his stage, he opened those pages of history which have a sense of India's tradition and pride
 dharmanirpekshata ke angan main jis rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko dur se hi salaam kiya jaataa tha, us aresas ke angan main khud purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kii maujuudagi ne maujuuda raajnneeti kaa vyakaran badal diya
 In the presence of Pranab Mukherjee, the Sangh chief explained the new RSS
 ek aankada dekhie jo bataata he ki sangh kii sweekruti lagaataar badhati ja rahi
 Its scope also continued to grow
 modi sarkaar banane se do maheene pehle desh bhar main 44 hajaar 982 shakhaaen lagati thim, jabaki is saal ke march main ye sankhya badhkar 58 hajaar 967 ho gai he
 About 95 percent of the country's geography has Sangh activists
 virdohi maanate hai ki sangh kaa ye vistaar uske dar kaa vistaar he, lekin sangh maanata he ki usne sabko jodakar apni takat badhaai he
 The presence of Pranab Mukherjee among the Sangh workers amidst all the uproar has opened up another door of possibilities for the RSS
 aresas apane gathan ke baad se hi sawaalon or vivaadon kaa saamana karata rahaa he
 But during this time his strength increased
 aazaadee ke baad kai aise maukey aae jab sangh kii madad sarkaron ne bhi lee
 From the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to his daughter Indira Gandhi, there was a connection with the Sangh somewhere
 saanskrithik rashtrawaad kaa ye wo ubhaar he jisane desh kii dhadakanon ko apni dhadakanon main shaamil kar liya
 Amid allegations of communalism, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh lit a flame of nationalism in whose luster the BJP is at the peak of power and Nagpur as the spiritual center of power
 ye barason kii tapasya kaa parinaam he
 Though some people accuse the RSS of being a Hindu communal organization, the RSS supported whatever stood against the power
 purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke nagpur jane ke saaye main sawaal uthaa ki unako janaa chahie yaa nahin
 Advice also came about what they should say
 lekin sangh ne aise tamaam logon ko pehle bhi apane kaaryakramon main bulaayaa he jinamein republican party of india ke netaa or dalit chintak dadasaheb ramakrishna suryabhaan gawai or vampanthi vichaaron vaale krishna ayyar jaise log shaamil hai
 During the Emergency in 1975, the RSS completely jumped into the JP movement
 yahaan tak ki 1977 main janata party kii sarkaar bani to purv congressi morarji desai ke naam par bhi sangh main sahmati thi
 In 1989, when VP Singh emerged as the hero of opposition unity against Rajiv Gandhi, BJP also stood with him in the shadow of the Sangh
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh khud ko raajnneeti se dur rahane vaala sanghathan bataata he lekin ye bhi sahi he ki uski taiyaar kii hui buniyaad par bijepi bees saal pehle satta main ai or ab chaar saal se purna bahumat ke saath hindustan kii hukumat chal rahi he
 Pakistan has reportedly refused to take the bodies of two Pakistani intruders
 seemaa suraksha bal (biguef) ne shuukravaar tadake bhartiya seemaa main daakhil hone kii koshish kar rahe donon ko goli markar dher kar diya tha
 BSF Deputy Inspector General Panaz said, "we had informed Pakistan in this regard and we were hopeful that they would take the body but they refused
" " unhone bataaya, "hamaare paas pakistani ghuspaithiyon se jude paryaapt saboot hai lekin pakistan tathyon ko saamne nahin laana chahta he

 Audio device maker 1more launched its new dual driver earphones in India in late January
 ise quad, tripal or single driver ke baad launch kiya gaya tha
 It was priced at Rs 4,499 in India, although it can be purchased on Amazon India site for Rs 3,999 now
 khaas baat ye he ki company ne ise grami aword vijeta luka bignaradi ke saath milakar taiyaar kiya he
 We have used this earphone for a long time and now we are passing it on to you
 aaie jaanate hai kaisaa he ye yearphone-bild quality, dizin-is yearphone kii body ko aluminium se taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Its total weight is 15 grams
 yearphone kii puri body main kahin bhi contile age nahin hai
 In such a situation, it gives soft feel from every angle
 isaki vir kii lambaai bhi kaaphi zyada he
 In this case, the problem of small wire is not with this earphone
 isaki vir bhi is tarah se dizin kii gai he, jisase ise raf condishan main aasaani se upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Its eartip is made of soft silicone, due to this, there is no problem in keeping it in the ears for long
 is yearphone ko dizin bhi is tarah se kiya gaya he ki ye kaanon par bhi dhang se feet ho jaataa he
 All of this gives a premium feel
 saath hi is yearphone ke vir main hi mike bhi diya gaya he
 The volume rocker and multi button are also present along with the mic
 iskaa upyog alag-alag function ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 But here we got a bit disappointed because the volume button and multi button ceiling is not tight
 is yearphone ko rakhane ke liye aapako paauch bhi company kii ore se diya jayega
 Performance: This earphone has a balance armature and separate dynamic driver
 isaki frequency range 20 Hz – 40,000 Hz tak kii he
 Listening to a variety of tracks for audio testing of this earphone, reggaeton, electro, dub, house, metal, jazz, dubstep, full bass, acoustic, trance and surround testing, and we considered it almost all of them
 electronic production ke saath hi hamane local gaanon ko bhi isamen suna jisamen kai tarah ke fok instruments kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 These earphones also stood out in these songs
 is yearphone main Treble or Bass kaa behtareen balance he
 Even after raising the sound completely, no kind of noise or distortion is felt and the sound also does not come out
 haalanki kuch gaanon main aawaaj kam aane se aisa mahasoos hota he ki audio thodaa or laud ho saktaa tha
 But it also happens sometimes because of the player
 3
 a plug with 5 mm gold plating has been given, which is compatible on both Android and ios
 faisla:behtareen bild quality ke saath audio kaa bhi balance shandaar he
 Only the finishing of multi buttons and volume buttons disappoints
 saath hi keemat ke lihaaj se body quality shandaar he lekin 3,999 rupee keemat thodi zyada lagati he

 Onion prices have increased once again
 mumbai main pyaaj kii keemat badhkar lagbhag doguni ho gai he
 The onion, which got up to Rs 25 last week, has now gone up to about Rs 45
 supplai main hui kami ko keemat badhane kii vajah bataaya ja rahaa he
 Onion is an important kitchen ingredient
 chaahe shaakaahaari khaanaa bananaa ho yaa maansaahaari, pyaaj jaruri hota he
 Onions use about one-third in vegetables and two-thirds in non-vegetarian food
 pyaaj kii keemat main badhottaree kii ek vajah yah bhi he ki pyaaj ugane vaale kisaanon ne pyaaj kii kheti karnaa kam kar diya he
 Farmers have started producing other crops instead of onions
 pyaaj kii fasal ke kharaab hone kii sambhaavna baaki fasalon ke mukable zyada hoti he
 This discourages farmers from onion production
 tippaniyan The merchant class says that there is no system to store onions
 rajya ke 232 apiemasi bazaaron main se 50 main hi pyaaj ko store karne kii vyavastha he
 This year, about 30 percent of the onion crop was damaged due to unseasonal rains
 kalabazari or aapurti main kami bhi keemat badhane ke liye jimmedaar bataae ja rahe hai
 Still the government says that it will investigate the reason for the price rise
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki 10 hajaar ton pyaaj kaa aayaat kiya jayega, par jaankaron kii maane to aane vaale vaqt main pyaaj kii keemat main giravat nahin hogi
 One reason for the increase in the price of onion is that onion growing farmers have reduced onion cultivation
 kisaanon ne pyaaj kii jagah anya fasalon kaa utpaadan shuru kar diya he
 Onion crop is more prone to spoilage than other crops
 isse kisaan pyaaj utpaadan ko lekar hatotsahit hai
 The comments vyapaaree varg kaa kahana he ki pyaaj ko store karke rakhane kii koi vyavastha nahin hoti he
 Out of the 232 APMC markets in the state, only 50 have arrangements to store onions
 is saal kareeb 30 pratishat pyaaj kii fasal bemausam barish ke chalate kharaab hui
 Black marketing and supply shortages are also being attributed to price increases
 phir bhi sarkaar kaa kahana he ki vah keemat badhane kii vajah kii jaanch karavaaegi
 The government says that 10,000 tons of onions will be imported, but according to experts, the price of onions will not fall in the coming time

 Sir Don Bradman (average 99
 94) apane aakiri test main 2 gend khelkar 0 par out hue
 Brendon mccallum of New Zealand scored a century in just 54 balls (145 off 79 balls, 21 fours, 6 sixes, strike rate 183) in the first innings of his last Test
 54) or sar vivian richards se (misbah-ul-haq se bhi) aage nikal gaye
 On the first day of the ongoing Test in Christchurch and in his last Test match, Brendon mccallum stated after a century from 54 balls that he was not aware of the record during the innings
 lekin wo har gend ko chauke yaa chakke main badalane ke iraade se ballebaazi kar rahe the
 After his innings of 145 off 79 balls, he said that he is hesitating to overtake Sir Vivian Richards
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki richards unke adarsh the or ummid jataai ki unki 'stroke-mekking' unhen pasand ai hogi
 In his last Test match, mccallum also held the record for the most sixes
 101 test maichon main maikkalam ke naam ab 106 chakke ho gaye hai
 Earlier this record was in the name of Adam Gilchrist
 unke naam 96 test maichon main 100 chhakkon kaa record tha
 The comments ittifaakan bharat main test maichon main sabase zyaada chhakkon kaa record virendra sahvaag ke naam he, jinke naam 104 test maichon main 91 chakke hai
 Then comes MS Dhoni, who has 78 sixes in 90 Tests, while the list also includes Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar, who has 69 sixes in 200 Tests
 yakeen maniye agar maikkalam bhartiya cricketer hote report likh rahe samvaadadaata kii tarah kai khabariyaa channel unki tulana Sir Don would have done to Bradman and many would have proved him even further than him
 christchurch main chal rahe test ke pehle din or apane aakiri test match main brendan maikkalam ne 54 gendon par shatkeey pari ke baad bataaya ki pari ke dauraan record ko lekar unhen pataa nahin tha
 But he was batting with the intention of turning every ball into fours or sixes
 79 gendon par apni 145 ranon kii pari ke baad unhone kaha ki unhen sar vivian richards se aage nikalne par kaafii jhijak ho rahi he
 He also said that Richards was his idol and hoped that he would have liked his 'stroke-making'
 apane aakiri test match main maikkalam ne sabase zyaada chhakkon kaa record bhi apane naam kar liya
 mccallum now has 106 sixes in 101 Test matches
 isse pehle ye record adam gilcrist ke naam tha
 He had a record of 100 sixes in 96 Test matches
 tippaniyan Ittifakan holds the record for most sixes in Test matches in India to Virender Sehwag, who has 91 sixes in 104 Tests
 uske baad emes dhoni aate hai jinke naam 90 test main 78 chakke hai jabaki is list main master blaster sachin tendulkar bhi aate hai, jinke naam 200 test main 69 chakke hai
 Believe that if mccallum was an Indian cricketer, many news channels compared him like a reporter writing a report sar don breadman se karte or kai to unhen unase aage bhi sabit kar dete
 In his last Test match, mccallum also held the record for the most sixes
 101 test maichon main maikkalam ke naam ab 106 chakke ho gaye hai
 Earlier this record was in the name of Adam Gilchrist
