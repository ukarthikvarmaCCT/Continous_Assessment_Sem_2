 bharat main purv roosi rajdoot vyacheslav trubnicove us jamaane main roosi news agency araaiye novosti ke patrkaar hua karte the
 One day he suddenly met Jyoti Basu and Atal Bihari Vajpayee joking outside the Parliament
 hairaan-pareshaan trubnicove ne unase kaha, ''magar maine to thodi der pehle aap donon ko sadan main ek-duusare par hamalaa karte dekha tha
 Later, while narrating this anecdote, he said, "I was shocked to see his totally changed attitude
" ''do bilkul virdohi siyaasi dhruvon se aane vaale donon netaaon ne phir trubnicove ko siyaasi dosti kaa ek sabak samajhaayaa
 Trubnikov wrote, "he told me that the strong democracy of India allows us to oppose each other on issues of ideology, but that does not mean that we do not respect the other
" aisa shaayad isliye he ki stallin kaa gulaag hamen raas nahin aa saktaa
 Both the late Basu and Vajpayee, incapable of disease, were deeply disappointed to see the conduct of the heirs of that great political tradition these days
 agar monsoon satr ko koi sanket maane, to hamaare siyaasi tabake main itani jabardast daraar paidaa ho chuki he or donon taraf itani gahari kadavaahat aa chuki he ki jaldi hi mail-milaap kii koi gunjaaish dikhaai nahin detii
 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had said that until the government removes Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje for allegedly helping former IPL chief Lalit Modi and similarly Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan after the Vyapam scam The Congress will not allow Parliament to run until it is removed
 unhone jo kaha, vah karke bhi dikhaa diya
 In fact, when Rahul told the House that Swaraj held his hand and said, "son, why are you so angry with me?" '' tab ve yahi jataa rahe the ki unka iraadaa us aaramdaayak club ko benakaab kar dene kaa he, jo sansad pichley kuch saal ke dauraan ban gai he
 Of course, this was not always the case
 yah nai giravat 2004 se shuru hui, jab endie chunaav haar gaya or swaraj tathaa uma bharti ne sonia gandhi ke pradhanmantri banane par sir mundwane kii dhamkee di
 It seemed that the BJP was deeply shocked by its defeat, which it could not recover
 tab navnirvaachit pradhanmantri manmohan singh or nae vipakshi netaaon vaajapeyi or laalkrishna adwani ke bich pehali mulaakaat acchhee nahin rahi thi
 The papers that Advani and Vajpayee had brought for discussion with him were put aside by Manmohan Singh
 pehali najar main, congress ke netaa kehete hai ki ve bijepi ke saath thik vahi kar rahe hai, jo usne satta main rahete hue unke saath kiya tha
 This may be an effective tactic for a short time, but in terms of strategy, it looks terrifying
 party main is baat ko lekar pehle hi thodi ghabrahat dikhaai dene lagi he ki november ke ant main shuru hone vaale sansad ke sheet satr main vah kya ranneeti apnayegi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has decided that he will not remove the three leaders, so the Congressmen are now thinking whether they will have to stop another session of Parliament to save their honor
 rajyasabha saansad or poyniyar akhbaar ke sampadak chandan mitra kehete hai, ''congress ne phir sansad ko thap kiya to dekhnaa, janabhaavana kis kadar uske khilaaf ho jaaegi
 Sources in the BJP say that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, after accepting several amendments sought by the Congress on the land bill, stepped in to end the confrontation with Congress leaders on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill
 lekin unhen ulate paanv lautaa diya gaya ki baatcheet istifon ke saath hi shuru ho sakati he
 Jaitley told India Today, "in Vajpayee's time (former foreign minister) Jaswant Singh used to say a Rajasthani proverb that if you want to climb a tree, at least one foot must be firmly planted, so that Get down from it
 '' baharhaal, bijepi kaa ek bada hissaa 25 congress saansadon ko paanch dinon ke liye nilambit karne ke loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ke faisle se asahaj mahasoos karata he
 It is said that this decision was taken from 'shikhar' i
e
 PM level
 us ek faisle ne bijepi or congress ke bich madhyasthata par pani pher diya
 The BJP is particularly keen to show something on the eve of Bihar elections
 bhoomi vidheyak par munh kii khaane ke baad uske sheersh netritv par jiesti vidheyak ko paarit karwaane kaa dabaav bad gaya he
 For this, the doors of informal interaction with several opposition parties have been opened on the possibility of convening a short two-day session
 bataate hai, jetali aisa satr bulaane ke haq main hai, lekin duusare party netaa haar ke jokhim se aagaah karte hai
 The BJP has 48 mps in the Rajya Sabha and its strategy is to isolate the Congress and bring together the other opposition parties on the economic reforms front
 trinmul congress (12 saansad) or samaajawaadee party (15 saansad) taiyaar he, lekin bataate hai ki mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party (12 saansad) dhulmul he
 On the other hand, the Janata Dal (united) with 12 mps was in support of GST at the beginning of the session, but now it will hardly agree
 mat vibhaajan hone par jedy (you), congress (68 saansad) tathaa vam dalon (11 saansad) ke saath sarkaar ke khilaaf vot degaa
 GST is a constitutional amendment bill and to pass it, two-thirds of the members present in the house must vote in its favor, so the addition of mps does not go in favor of BJP
 ek varisht bijepi netaa ne mana ki party ne jiesti vidheyak ko 2016 ke madhya tak multavee karne kaa man bana liya tha
 By that time, the face of many Rajya Sabha seats will change and most of the changes will be in favor of BJP
 agle saal (congress ke 21 or bijepi ke 17 saansadon sahit) rajyasabha ke 76 saansad ritair ho jaaenge
 However, many BJP mps will re-elect, especially from the newly won states of Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana
 congress ke liye yah buree khabar he, kyonki iskaa matlab he ki bispi or sapa sareekhee kshetreey partiyaan bahut soch-samajhakar daanv lagaayengi
 It also means that Modi has decided that he will not cross the Lakshman Rekha to join hands with Sonia
 congress ke sthagan prastaav ke dauraan, jab sushamaa swaraj ne lalit modi ke saath apane rishton kaa bachaav kiya, tab sadan main pradhanmantri modi kii gaiyr-maujuudagi ko amaryadit mana gaya
 Modi hardly came to the House
 ve sansad ke apane daftar main aate hai or logon se milte hai
 a mildly worded statement by Forest and Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar at the end of the monsoon session probably reflects Modi's thinking
 javdekar ne kaha, ''agar congress party sansad ko kaam nahin karne degi, to sarkaar ko sansad ke bagaiyr hi kaam karnaa padegaa

 Bleaching of teeth is usually required in one to two and a half years
 'daanton ko khubasurat banane kaa chalan mahanagaron ke alaava madhyam or chote shaharon main bhi badha he
 Kumar Shetty, including a consultant at the Columbia Asia Hospital in Mysore, says that most of the women who come for treatment of teeth are women, but men are also interested in this

 Angry faction of Yogendra Yadav in the party alleges that he made a news plant in the media against Arvind Kejriwal and the party

 Bollywood director Dibakar Banerjee, Abhay Deol, who plays an IAS officer in the upcoming Shanghai film, hopes that the film will be able to make an impact on people and force them to raise their voice
 36 varshiya abhaya ne ek saakshaatkaar ke dauraan bataaya, 'main sochataa hum ki yah logon ko un chizon ke bare main prashn poochne par majaboor kar degi, jinhen ve nahin poochhate
 We are just going on with life and accepting things as they are coming
 'abhaya deol ne kaha, 'main samajhataa hum ki log film dekhenge or kahenge, maine is bare main kabhi nahin sochaa, yah baaten mere dimag main aa chuki thi or main inhen dekhtaa rahaa lekin aawaaj kabhi nahin uthaai kyonki ve bahut badi thi
 Maybe the film inspires people to ask some fundamental questions
 ,vaise dibaakar banerjee kaa kahana he ki film koi bhi bana-banaaya hal nahin degi
 He said, 'the film will not give any solution
 ek kavita, ek kahani aapako sirf sochane par majaboor kar sakati he
 There is no solution in these things
 yah kahana morrkhtaa hogi ki mere paas koi aisi dawaai he, jo in samasyaon ko hal kar degi

 com / bkngjyx2yj Has the Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi obstructed rescue and relief work on Sunday in Kollam, Kerala? It is better to ask both of them to think on this question themselves and if possible, write sorry to the officials of Kerala
 saarvajanik rup se shaabaashi bhi den ki in afasaron ne vahi kaha jo janhit main unhen thik laga
 It is no less adventurous to say these officers that their visit within a few hours of the accident created new troubles
 pradhanmantri or rahul gandhi ko ek do din baad daura karnaa chahie tha
 We are living in a period of fierce competition in showy politics
 netaa apane har lamhe ko ek photo samajhataa he or janata us photo ko paardarshee

 har netaa ab is pratispardhaa kaa shikaar he
 It is not necessary to get there by accident
 ek sanghathan to turant maukey se apni tasviir viral karaane lagata he jaise sara bachaav kaary usee ke zariye sampann ho rahaa he
 There are more people there, but he does not make his picture viral on social media, and the disciple of these pictures, at the same time, starts to show his greatness under the pretext of the photo as if reaching is the ultimate sensibility
 kisi ko sochna chahie ki jahaan sau se zyada log mare hon, sainkadon ghayal hon or visphotakon kii gandh se ilaaka bharaa ho vahaan usee vakt pradhanmantri kaa pahunchnaa sahi tha? jis tarah se kerala ke police or swasthya sevaaon ke pramukhon ne indian express se kaha he usase lagata he ki in dauron kii vajah se prashasan ko kaaphi pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa he

 We were stuck in work

 The comments baqayda isaki jaanch honi chahie ki kya pradhanmantri or rahul gandhi or unke saath gaye tamaam logon ne ai si you main ghusane se pehle juute utaare the? aspataal kaa diya epran pahana tha? topi pahani thi? photographer kaise ai si you main chale gaye? itani jaldi unka paas kaise ban gaya? kiski ijazat se ve ai si you main gaye? aar ramesh ke bayaan se lagata he ki unke virodh ke baavjood ai si you main netaa or unke saath kuch log gaye
 ICU has its own protocol which is more sensitive than pm's protocol
 zaraa chook sankraman failaa sakati he or mariz mar saktaa he
 It is important that both leaders come to the fore on this lapse
 in donon netaaon ko patr likhakar afsos jataana chahie or aapas main tay karnaa chahie ki bheeshan durghatana sthal par turant pahunchane se bachenge
 a few years ago, when terrorist incidents were constantly happening, there was a debate as to whether a photograph of VIP visit is necessary when a hundred things are needed to save lives in hospitals? As far as i am concerned, VIP had reduced the go

 One must think that where more than a hundred people died, hundreds were injured and the area was filled with the smell of explosives, the Prime Minister's arrival at that time was right? The way the police and health services chiefs of Kerala have told the Indian Express that it seems that the administration has suffered a lot due to these visits
 acchhee baat he ki in adhikariyon ne media main aakar bayaan diya he taaki aage ke liye koi parampara ban sake
 There is a code of disaster management all over the world
 bharat main bhi he or vah bhi kaaphi acha he
 Despite this, our leaders do not understand the difference between disaster management and their publicity
 kerala ke police pramukh tii pi senkumar ne indian express se kaha ki jab unki police bachaav kaary main lagi thi tab unhonen pradhanmantri or rahul gandhi ke kollam daure ko lekar aapatti jataai thi

 solah april ke express main isi se judi ek or khabar chhapi he
 This time the state's Director General of Health r Ramesh has said that it was inappropriate for the Prime Minister and Rahul Gandhi to come to the ICU of Burn Ward
 mujhe yah bayaan pard kar hairaani hui ki itane bade netaaon se ai si you main jane kii naadaani kaise ho sakati he ? khaaskar bern ward ke ai si you main jahaan sankraman kaa khatra hota he
 The biggest challenge is to prevent burns from infection
 swasthya sevaaon ke mahanideshak ramesh ne jo bayaan diya he vah or bhi sharmnaak he
 The security personnel pushed Ramesh and the doctor
 kya ve nahin dekh sake ki aspataal main doctoron ko aana janaa jaruri he na ki pradhanmantri yaa rahul gandhi kaa
 He had to argue that it was very important for him to go in, then he was let go
 ramesh ne bataaya ki mariz jab najuk haalat main aspataal laayaa jaataa he use golden aavar kehete hai
 It is a very important time in which it costs a moment to save a patient's life
 aar ramesh ne kaha ki sirf modi or rahul hi nahin unke saath anya log or photographer bhi ai si you main ghus aae
 i opposed it but we were not listened to
 photographer? ai si you main? aap ravivaar ko channelon par chali ek ek tasviir ko yaad kijiye
 It seemed that arrangements had been made to reach the camera everywhere
 surgery team kii ek nurse ne bayaan diya he ki use or uski chaar sahyogiyon ko pradhanmantri ke surakshakarmiyon ne roak diya
 She could not go to the operation theater
 us vakt ai si you main bhartee ek mariz kii haalat kaaphi bighad gai thi
 We had to run to another block but were stopped for half an hour
 kya pataa in dauron kii vajah se kisi kii jaan chali gai ho
 The comments baqayda isaki jaanch honi chahie ki kya pradhanmantri or rahul gandhi or unke saath gaye tamaam logon ne ai si you main ghusane se pehle juute utaare the? aspataal kaa diya epran pahana tha? topi pahani thi? photographer kaise ai si you main chale gaye? itani jaldi unka paas kaise ban gaya? kiski ijazat se ve ai si you main gaye? aar ramesh ke bayaan se lagata he ki unke virodh ke baavjood ai si you main netaa or unke saath kuch log gaye
 ICU has its own protocol which is more sensitive than pm's protocol
 zaraa chook sankraman failaa sakati he or mariz mar saktaa he
 It is important that both leaders come to the fore on this lapse
 in donon netaaon ko patr likhakar afsos jataana chahie or aapas main tay karnaa chahie ki bheeshan durghatana sthal par turant pahunchane se bachenge
 a few years ago, when terrorist incidents were constantly happening, there was a debate as to whether a photograph of VIP visit is necessary when a hundred things are needed to save lives in hospitals? As far as i am concerned, VIP had reduced the go

 bacchon ke jivan kaa abhinn ang ban chuke videogem mata pita bhale hi bade laad se unhen dete hon lekin visheshgyon or chikitsakon kaa maananaa he ki yah unki swaabhaavik maasoom soch ko khatm kar unhen hinsa kii ore pravrutt kar rahe hai
 In order to give children a life full of better physical facilities, parents who are busy making money day and night do not pay attention to this small but very important thing
 jab tak unhen yah baat samaj aati he tab tak bahut der ho chuki hoti he
 Psychologist Dr Vandana Prakash of Fortis Hospital told about this, 'video games are ending the innocence of children
 aajkal banane vaale zyaadaatar videogem main sirf hinsa or badale kii bhavanaaen dikhaai jaati hai
 Unknowingly, children learn the same
 ’ vah kahati hai, ‘bacchon ke bich sabase mashhoor video game mario main bhi hinsa dikhaai jaati he
 Nowadays, cds or Internet video games all have a theme of violence
 usamen bacchon ko goliyaan chalaanaa or logon ko maarna hota he
 In such a situation, children do not see any evil in these things gradually
 ’bacchon ke manovigyaan par kaam karne vaale manovishaleshak doctor rakesh kaa kahana he, ‘bacchon ke dimag main hinsa ke prati jo buraai kii bhaavana hoti he vah hinsak video games khilne se mitane lagati he
 Gradually, he also treats violence as normal actions
 is tarah ke video games se bacchon ke bartaav par bahut gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 'doctor Prakash says,' It is heard many times that nowadays young children kill their siblings
 unhen chat se phenk dete hai yaa phir unhen chaaku maar dete hai, in sabhi ke peeche in hinsak kaaryakramon or video games kaa bahut bada haath he
 'pediatrician Doctor Sucheta Dinkar says,' Playing video games too much affects the mind and heart of the children, which affects their whole thinking and they inadvertently start accepting violence and crime as normal
 ’vah kahati hai, ‘video game khilne kaa asar keval jahani hi nahin hota
 It also has a bad effect on the body
 video game khilne ke liye bachche ghanton computer ke saamne baithe rahete hai
 This causes dry eye problems
 game khelte samay bacchon ke baithne kaa tarika sahi nahin hota, jisase gardan or peeth main dard kii shikaayat hoti he
 Children continue to eat something while playing hour games
 isse bacchon main motopa badhata he or shaareerik sakriyata kam hone ke kaaran unke shaareerik vikaas par bhi asar padataa he
 'doctor Rakesh says,' Small children have a mind like a paper, they start doing what they see
 aajkal bacchon main sabase zyada jin video games kaa craij hai vah hai bonus round, invicible vals, bitman, mortl combat, panch time explojan or cross fire aadi
 Most of them are full of violence
 in sabhi games main sirf mardhaad hi he
 This increases the tendency of violence in children
 ’ doctor prakaash kaa kahana he ki bacchon ko zyada samay tak video games khilne se roka janaa chahie taaki unka bachapan maasoom or saaf suthra rahe
 The Congress, which the Congress considers its trump card, has been waiting for it for a long time
 party kehete he ki wo aane vaali hai, lekin wo kab aaengi or kis paimaane par aaengi, ye shaayad usne kisi ko ab tak bataaya nahin
 Yes, we are talking about Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
 upi ke baad ab aawaaj ai he ek or chunavi rajya punjab se or aawaaj buland karne vaala koi chhutbhaiya netaa nahin, balki party ke pradesh adhyaksh khud captain amarinder singh hai
 Amarinder Singh wants Priyanka along with Rahul to come to Punjab and campaign for the party
 darasal, upi main sabase pehlapriyankako raibareli-amethi se baahar nikalakar prachaar karne kii maang uthi thi
 Priyanka also appeared in group posters
 magar is shart ke saath ki unki tasviir rahul se badi na ho or akele unka poster na ho
 Recently, UP Congress President Raj Babbar and Publicity Committee President Sanjay Singh met Priyanka Gandhi and announced that they are ready to campaign outside Vaira bareilly-amethi, but the program will be held only after the announcement of election dates
 shaayad yahi sunakar ab amarinder kii bhi laalasaa jag uthi he
 In such a situation when Amarinder, who dreams of becoming the CM of Punjab, is giving everything
 wo jaanate hai ki abaki baar nahin to phir kabhi nahin
 So how can they not remember the trump aces of Congressmen
 shaayadrahul gandhi, navjot siddhu jaise star prachaarkon ke saath hi captain priyanka kaa istemaal bataur super star prachaarak karne kii bhi aas lagaae hai
 But the question is whether Priyanka, who has agreed to campaign with the UP Congress, will accept the Captain's word

 Terrorist organizations such as lashkar-e-taiba have received strong reactions in India over the revelations by former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf about Pakistan's support and training
 tamaam raajnneetik dalon or suraksha visheshgyon ne kaha ki antat: sach saamne aa gaya he or ab vaanchit aatankwaadiyon ko bharat ke hawaale kiya janaa chahie
 After Musharraf's statement, both the BJP and the Congress simultaneously targeted Pakistan for helping terrorists against India
 kendriya mantri em
 Venkaiah Naidu said, 'let's finally tell the truth
 agar vah vaaki aatankwaad se ladane main dilchaspee rakhte hai to kabhi na kabhi unhen bhi aawaaj uthaani chahie
 They should really hand these people over to India, because they have committed heinous crimes here
 ' The Urban Development Minister said that now Musharraf himself made it very clear that he had helped Dawood Ibrahim and had given him asylum earlier
 pakistan jimmedaari samajhataa he or use daaud tathaa bharat main vaanchit anya logon ko saunp dena chahie
 ' rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal ne musharraf ke bayaan par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'jaise hero honge, vaise hi log honge
 When asked about this, Pakistan's High Commissioner to India Abdul Basit did not respond and only said, 'I will talk on these issues later
 ' Former Army Chief V
 pi
 Malik said that now the truth has been revealed how Musharraf was trying to deceive people inside and outside the country
 congress netaa pramod tiwari ne osama bin laden or aatankwaadi sanghathanon par musharraf ke bayaan ke baad kaha ki yah saaf he ki pakistan aatankwaad kaa thikaana he
 BJP National Secretary Shrikant Sharma said that after these revelations, the truth of Pakistan has come to the fore and bjp's stand on Pakistan has also been proved that it has set up factories of terror against India
 musharraf ne haal hi main ek media intervyuu main sweekaar kiya tha ki pakistan ne kashmir main aatankwaad ko badhaava dene ke liye 1990 ke dashak main lashkar-e-taiyaba jaise aatankwaadi sanghathanon kii madad kii thi or unhen training di thi
 The 72-year-old Musharraf said that terrorists like Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-zawahiri used to be the heroes of Pakistan at first, but later became villains
 purv sainya shaasha ke bayanon par kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha, 'aatankwaadi sanghathanon ko samarthan kii baat kabool karne vaala musharraf kaa bayaan aatankwaad ke sangrakshakon or use badhaava dene waalon kaa ikbaalia bayaan he
 He said that once again the real face of Pakistan has been revealed
 tippaniyan Congress leader Manish Tiwari said that due to Partition, there is bitterness in both India and Pakistan, in which millions of people lost their lives
 unhone kaha, 'bharat main pakistan virdohi vibhaajankaree bayaan or pakistan main bharat virdohi bayaan hote rahete hai or donon taraf aise log hai jo isse phayda uthaate hai
 ' bijepi netaa sharma ne kaha ki pakistan jis bhashaa main samaj sake, bharat use jawaab dene main sakasham he or pakistan se bharat-virdohi gatividhiyon ko lambey samay tak bardaasht nahin kiya jayega

 yah shiksha paddati vyaavhaarik gyaan or aacharan ko bhi viksit hone kaa avasar nahin detii
 More information and knowledge than today's teacher is available on Google and Internet
 ucch shiksha ke vikaas kii baat karen to pichley ek dashak main bharat main ucch shiksha ke kshetra main record tarakkee dekhne ko mili he
 Thousands of technical institutions and private universities have been established in the country
 sarkaar ke udaaravaadi ravaie ke kaaran yah mumkin hua he
 In the last decade, the government has established technical institutions of higher education such as IIM, NIT, IIT, National Law University and AIIMS
 isse ucch shiksha main chaatro kaa jiiaar (gros inrolment rate) badha he or yah 9 fisadi par aa gaya he jo ki ausat global dar se 6 fisadi kam he
 This is less than 50 percent compared to countries like America and Australia
 sarkaar kii koshish 2020 tak ise 30 fisadi tak laane kii he
 According to a survey by NASSCOM, till 2014 a total of 10 crore youth in the country were between 17 and 19 years old
 inamen se kul 2 karod chaatr ucch shiksha tak pahunchate hai
 The remaining 80 percent people are left behind for some reason
 isliye desh main ucch shiksha praapt karne vaale chaatro kii paryaapt sankhya maujuud he
 But there has also been a record decline in higher education engineers, itis, pharmacy, hotel management, management institutions etc
 in the last two-three years
 sarkaar ke karodon—arabon rupayon se bani sansthaaen vidhyaarthiyon kii baat dekh rahi hai
 The attitude of students towards higher education in technical institutions in all states has been indifferent
 pichley do saalon main 30 fisadi se zyada nijee kshetra ke santhaan yaa to band ho gaye hai yaa unhone apni siton kii sankhya main kami karwaai he
 Most of the branches and courses of engineering colleges, institutes of management, pharmacy and colleges of higher education have also reduced their attitude towards students
 sarkaar kii udaaravaadi niti kaa phayda uthaakar bahut-si sansthaaon ne anek college khol liye or unamem siton kii sankhya badha lee
 Instead of one shift, the institutes were run in two shifts, disturbing the balance of demand and supply in the field of higher and technical education
 isse chaatro kaa placement bahut hi nimna yaa ausat rah gaya
 Therefore, students are becoming alienated from educational institutions
 ucch or takneekee shiksha ko behatar banane ke liye kuch thos kadam uthaae jane kii jarurat he
 Let us see what those steps can be: - "an entrance examination, a syllabus and a fee" system should be implemented for all institutions of higher and technical education at the national level
 - ucch or takneekee shiksha kaa paathyakram shodh / practical or training par aadhaarit hona chahie
 - The curriculum and facilities for higher and technical education at the national level should be tailored and time-bound to the market
 - vyavsaayik paathyakramon ke liye puure desh main samaan paathyakram or ek hi pravesh niti yojit kii jaae
 This will not waste the time and money of the students in preparing for various exams and they will be able to focus fully on the same goal
 - ucch shiksha sansthaaon main chaatro kii training ke paathyakram main unke number 75 fisadi se adhik hone chahie or unase ucch gunvattta kaa kaary karavaaya jaae
 - If any new technology comes in the market then it should be brought to the centers of higher education, so that students develop good understanding ability
 - shikshakon ko samay-samay par do se teen maheene kii training par bheja janaa chahie, jisase ve apane chaatro ko nai takanic samajha saken
 - Students should be sent across the country for some time to study in higher educational institutions of other states
 yadi hamaari sarkaar samay rahete nahin jaagi to aane vaale samay main shikshan sansthaaen gyaan kaa centre or naukari kaa jariya na rahakar berogari paidaa karne vaale centre ban jaaengi
 Today, we have time to connect it with Skill India and open centers to develop higher skills or skills
 kitaabi gyaan ko khatm kiya jaae

 america or sanyukt raashtra vagairah puch rahe hai ki sarkaar is shaks ko kaabo kyon nahin kar paa rahi he?''major general gafoor ne kaha ki nae fouj pramukh kaa pakkaa iraadaa he ki pakistan ke suraksha halaat sudhaarney hai
 He said, "even if Pakistan improves and the soldiers reach the grave, they will not regret it
" general bajva ke liye kuch logon se mulk kii ahmiyat adhik he
 The good of the country should always be above
 '' jahaan tak giraftaar main america kii trump sarkaar ke dabaav kaa sawaal he to unka jawaab tha, ''puri duniya se tamaam tarah ke dabaav hai
 We do not live in the skull

 '' Buoyed by the Assam victory, the BJP has started preparations for the UP assembly elections
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah ye baat achche se jaanate hai ki 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle 2017 main uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav final se pehle nock out quarter final match he
 Even after losing it, the BJP will definitely play the final match of 2019, the guarantee of winning will be 40 percent
 isliye amit shah ne apana puraa focus upi par kendrit kar diya he
 To win the election in Keshav Mauryup, the first offer of social engineering, BJP made Keshav Prasad Maurya president of UP BJP to make a dent in the backward caste vote bank, keeping in mind the caste politics of this time, and started the social engineering board
 She did it
 upi main bijepi kii soshal ejineering ko anjaam dene kaa kaam khud amit shah or upi ke prabharee or piem narendra modi ke vishwaasapaatr om prakaash maathur kar rahe hai
 This is why Naqvi was sent from Jharkhand to Rajya Sabha, keeping in mind the caste equations, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi is being sent to Rajya Sabha from Jharkhand
 unki jagah shiv pratap shukla ko laayaa gaya jo upi bijepi main ek puraane brahman chehre hai
 Because the bjp's Social Engineers know very well that in UP, the BJP will get equal to Muslim vote
 nakvi ko upi se rajyasabha bhejne se bijepi ke kor vot bank main thik sandesh nahin jaataa
 Its effect was reflected in the results of the UP election
 jila adhyaksh banaae jane main pichhadi jatiyon ko tarjeehaisaliye is baar jila adhyaksh banaate hue party ne jatigat samikarnon ko dhyaan main rakhaa
 In the last 20 years, 80 to 90 percent of the district presidents were made by Brahmins and Thakurs
 is baar 94 jila adhyakshon or nagar adhyakshon main se 44 pichhadi or ati pichhadi jati se, 29 brahman, 10 thakur, 9 vaisya or 4 dalit samaaj se hai
 The way the BJP, along with Nitish Kumar in 2010 on the basis of the political card of the Mahadalit card in Bihar, cleared the entire sweep of Bihar from the alliance of Lalu Yadav's RJD and Ram Vilas Paswan's Lokjan Shakti Party
 kuch isi tareeke se jatigat samikarnon kaa guna-bhaag ke jariye bijepi upi main jeet kaa paracham laharnaa chaahati he
 Yadav, Jatav and Muslim together constitute 35 percent in UP
 vahiin bijepi kii najar baaki 65 pratishat par he
 bjp's Social Engineers feel that BJP may come out in UP based on the coordination of backward and forward castes
 nishad or dalit jatiyon par daale ja rahe hai dorabijapi ne is baar mayawati (bispi) ke vot bank main send lagane kii puri taiyaari abhi se shuru kar di hai
 In most of the assemblies from Kanpur to Varanasi, there is about 10 thousand to 15 thousand votes of Nishad caste
 isliye bijepi nishad jati ke netaaon ko apane saath jod rahi he
 The BJP has also started talks to get Ram Bharuhal Nishad angry with BJP for not getting a seat from the BSP
 bijepi ne upi ke nishad or dalit jatiyo main paith rakhane vaale netaaon par dore daalane bhi shuru kar die hai
 Preparation for a big impact among the so-called small castes, the BJP has also started pulling small and extremely backward castes towards itself
 jaise ki rajbhar jati kaa devaria, baliya, azamgarh, salempur or gajipur samet kai anya jilon kii vidhansabha seat main prabhaav he
 Rajbhar Samaj has 30 thousand to 40 thousand votes in these assemblies
 rajbhar samaaj kii upi chunaav main ahmiyat ko samajhate huimbijapi adhyaksh amit shahne pichley saal varanasi main rajbhar samaaj kii raily ko sambodhit kiya tha
 Before the BJP elections, Ashok Rajbhar's party wants to merge the Bharatiya Samaj Party with the BJP or is looking to form an alliance with them by giving them 10 seats

 This Brahma Chetna Yatra will go to 130 assemblies across UP by October
 har vidhansabha main yatra kaa swaagat bijepi ke sthaneey netaa or kaaryakarta karenge
 Preparation to occupy Purvanchal due to coalition, on the other side of these there is already bjp's alliance with Apna Dal, another backward caste party of UP
 pratapgarh, jonpur, elahabaad, varanasi or mirzapur main aane vaali lagbhag 30 vidhansabha siton main apana dal kaa acha khaasaa prabhaav he
 The BJP feels that with these small parties coming together, the 110 to 120 seats in the districts adjacent to Purvanchal and Varanasi will become so strong that it will be a far-fetched victory for everyone

 On June 4, a conference of booth level workers in Kanpur and after this in Lucknow will also be organized
 grahamantri rajnath singh bhi puure upi main 6 public meeting karenge
 Rajnath Singh is scheduled to address the rally in Amroha on 5 June and in Mau on 9 June
 ujjwala skim kii yojana kaa milegaa sidhaa phaaydis chunaav main bijepi kii koshish rahegi ki ujjwala skim ke tahat har vidhansabha main 7 hajaar se 8 hajaar tak gas conection disambar ke ant tak garib pariwaron ko de die jaaen
 There is a plan to make direct contact by giving it on the recommendation letter of mps and BJP mlas
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki vidhansabha chunaav main unhen iskaa phayda milegaa
 In fact, the BJP has started gearing up for the UP assembly battle, but has not yet decided who will be the chief minister
 mukhyamantri pad ke liye smriti irani or mahesh sharma sabase aage hai, lekin piem modi or amit shah kuch or hi chaahate hai
 That's why Home Minister Rajnath Singh said at a rally in Saharanpur that bjp's exile in UP will end after 14 years

 sabhi dalon ke bade netaaon ke chunaav prachaar ke baavjood ek varg aisa bhi jo santven charan main matdaan nahin karegaa
 The women working in Anganwadi have decided not to vote in the seventh phase
 unki shikaayat he ki koi bhi raajnneetik dal anganwari main kaam karne vaali mahilaon kii samasyaon ko lekar sajag nahin he
 The women working in Anganwadi allege that all political parties take them to the rally of their leaders and assure that the leaders will mention all their problems as well as solve their problems soon including the next generation when the next government is formed 
 lekin kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ke netaa ne unki samasyaon kaa zikr tak nahin kiya
 In view of this, Anganwadi workers will not vote in the last phase
 bhale hi unki sankhya or prabhaav kam ho lekin purvanchal kii kareeb 40 hazaar anganwari varkar is baar apane matadhikaar kaa istemaal nahin karengi
 In the UP Assembly elections, all political parties have to put their full strength to win the elections and are not even paying attention to such a small vote bank which is different from caste-religion

 The petitioner advocate Moti Lal Yadav says, 'in that i demanded three things

 The Election Commission should ban them if they do caste based rally
 duusari, jo log isamen doshi paye jate hai unhen chunaav ladane se pratibandhit kare chunaav ayog
 And thirdly, the parties who are found guilty of rallies on the basis of caste should cancel the election commission
 'gauratlab he ki upi main aksar jati aadhaarit reliyaan hoti rahati hai
 Be it the BSP or the ruling SP, no party wants to be behind each other in organizing such rallies

 lashkar aatanki david hedli ke pratyrpan par apane akalan par uthe vivaad ke bich purv rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar or pashchim bengal ke rajyapal emke narayanan ne kaha ki bharat gambhir he or lashkar aatanki ke pratyrpan main ruchi rakhata he
 Asked about this disclosure by wikileaks, Narayanan told reporters, "there is no question of the fact of our seriousness on extradition
" hamen uske bare main soochnaaon main ruchi he
 According to the leaked document of wikileaks, about two years ago, the Indian government was probably just pretending to seek extradition of lashkar-e-taiba terrorist David Headley from the US
 vikiliks ke anusaar 17 disambar, 2009 ko america videsh vibhaag ko bheje gayi ek cabel main tatkaaleen america rajdoot timothy je romar ne khulaasa kiya tha ki us samay ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar emke narayanan ne unase kaha tha ki sarkaar vastav main aisa karnaa nahin chaahati, lekin aisa karte hue darshana chaahati he
 On the issue of Headley's extradition, Narayanan told him that it was difficult not to show such efforts, but the government is not seeking extradition at this time
 america adhikariyon ke bich samvaad ke bare main tippanee karne purv enese ne inkaar karte hue kaha ki is vishay par kisi bhi andeh ke bare main america adhikariyon se poocha janaa chahie
 He said, "how can i comment about the dialogue between the American officials?" aap iske bare main america rajdoot se kyon nahin poochhate hai
 Narayanan said that neither he nor anyone else would believe any such possibility
 unhone kaha, ‘‘aise prashn aapako america adhikariyon se poochne chahie
 You obviously cannot ask this question, because as far as we are concerned, we are quite interested in Headley's extradition and information about him
 ’’ unhone kaha ki is vishay par americanyon se puuchhie, ve jaise chaah rahe hai likh rahe hai
 Due to the minimum balance of banks and the charges that are levied on withdrawing cash from atms, common people face a lot of problems
 aam logon kii in pareshaaniyon ko dur karne ke liye beete dinon rigerv bank of india (arabiai) kii ore se sanket bhi die gaye hai
 However, people are hopeful that in the General Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman can make some important announcements regarding the minimum balance
 'bajet 2019 kii vistrut kawarej ke liye yahaan clic karen'atm tranjection par arabiai ne die the sanketabete june kii maudrik samiksha baithak main rigerv bank of india ne atm se paise nikaalane par lagane vaale charge ko lekar positive sanket die the
 Actually, the RBI decided to set up a committee
 yah cameti bank atm se tranjection par lagane vaali fees or charge kii samiksha karegi
 This committee will explain the impact of the charges on transactions from bank atms to customers
 rigerv bank kii is cameti ke chairman indian bank association ke siio hai
 The issue of minimum balance was also a big issue in the year 2018
 is report main bataaya gaya tha ki vitt varsh 2014-15 se 2017-18 ke bich 21 saarvajanik bainkon or nijee kshetra ke teen diggaj bainkon ne bachat khaaton main minimum balance na rakh paane vaale graahakon se kul 11,500 karod rupee kii kamai kii
 The minimum balance charge of each bank varies
 esbiai apane bachat khaataa dharakon se nunatam balance na rakhane par 5 se 15 rupee (saath main jiesti) katata he
 SBI customers of metro cities have to keep a minimum balance of Rs 3,000 in the account every month
 chote shaharon main har maheene 2,000 rupee or gramin ilaakon main 1,000 rupee rakhane kii shart hoti he
 What are the expectations, the people are expected to get a discount on the minimum balance in the budget
 is baat kii ummid kii ja rahi he ki vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman bainkon ko minimum balance main raahat dene ko kah sakati hai
 Apart from this, there is a hope of getting relief on the charge on withdrawing cash from atms

 The oldest party in the country is now starting to crack down inside
 aisa lag rahaa he ki vahaan khule taur par do gut ho gaye hai or donon hi aamane-saamne hai
 On the one hand, Tosonia is a tired advisor of Gandhi's loyalists and on the other, there is a small army of loyal soldiers of Orrahul Gandhi
 chunaav ke pehle tak to halaat saamaanya se dikh rahe the
 Of course there were differences in ticket distribution
 lekin paraajay or vah bhi jabardast paraajay ne party main rahul samarthakon ke sur badal die
 He appears to be aggressive and has no target of defeating BJP before him
 lakshya agar kuch he to saamne vaale gut se party kii aantarik satta chhinana
 This faction advocates full authority to Rahul Gandhi in the party and wants to see him sitting on the post of president
 iske peeche party ko phir se majboot karne kii chahat nahin he balki apni prabhusatta majboot karnaa he
 Rahul Gandhi's supporters currently do not have the strength to make big decisions in the party and establish their people in important positions
 party kii loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad uname se kai par gaaj bhi giri thi
 But now this group is openly exposed and when the case of Janardan Dwivedi came, it was as if earthquake occurred
 party ke kai netaaon ne jinamein ajay maakan bhi hai, unke khilaaf turant karrwai kii maang kii
 a series of statements against him started
 aisa laga ki party main saaf taur par do dhade ho gaye hai
 If seen carefully, this dispute seems to be part of the campaign to hold power which has been going on in the party for a long time
 yah saath ke dashak ke uttarardh main indicket or sindicket ke rup main chali thi jisamen puraani team ko indira gandhi kii ‘yuva’ team ne ant main maat dekar party se hi baahar kar diya
 This time too, the same situation is being created that betting on the old leaders of the party and Rahul's team only has the right to take important decisions
 darasal karaari shikast ke baad congress ke puraane netaaon kaa manobal gir chukaa he or ve koi sahi faisla bhi nahin le paa rahe hai
 It is obvious that they do not even have any moral basis to make decisions
 to jang kii shuruyaat ho chuki he
 Things will change as soon as Rahul Gandhi is crowned and the faction of the party which was not so vocal till now, will start speaking in its tone
 lekin lakh take kaa sawaal yah he ki kya unke paas modi ke bijepi ko parrast karne ke liye vichaaron kaa paryaapt ‘barood’ he? The cos came to his office to collect bribe money
 jaise hi unhone raju se 25 hajaar rupee liye, vaise hi nigaraanee kii team ne range haathon pakad liya
 Bribe CO Rakesh Kumar is currently being questioned
 iske baad patna ke nigaraanee court main unhen pesh kiya jayega

 ji haa, rudraksh yani wo vastu jise rudra kaa aksh yani aansu kaha jaataa he
 Rudraksh is believed to have originated from the tears of Lord Shiva and has been worn as a jewel since ancient times
 rudraksh is dharti par akeli aisi vastu he jisko mantra jaap or grahon ko niyantrit karne ke liye sabase uttam mana jaataa he
 According to astrologers, the characteristics and glory of Rudraksha have also been mentioned in the scriptures
 rudraksh kii mahimapracheen kaal ke is aabhushan ko mantra jaap or grahon ko niyantrit karne ke liye uttam mana jaataa he
 With the use of Rudraksha, we can also overcome the suffering of Shani
 rudraksh ke istemaal se shanidev kii krupa bhi hasil kar sakate hai
 To wear Rudraksh, it is very important to follow certain rules
 shani kaa mahatv or asararudraksh kii takat itani zyada he ki uske kuch khaas niyam dharm hote hai or agar un niyam dharmon kaa paal nahin kiya jaataa to bure fal bhi milane lagate hai
 But according to astrologers, if Rudraksha is used properly, you can get relief from the troubles caused by Saturn's crooked eye
 chaliye sabase pehle aapako bataate hai ki shani kaa kya mahatv he or uskaa hamaare jivan par kya asar padataa he
 
 
 - Shani is related to all kinds of karma and its fruits in our life
 - shani dand kaa adhipati he isliye hamaare dushkarmon kii sajaa bhi detaa he
 - By the grace of Shani, one gets employment and goes on
 - agar shani peedaadaayak ho to jivan main sangharsh kii maatra bad jaati he
 - The person has difficulties everywhere from employment to health
 - shani ke anukool hone parjivan main sangharsh nahin hota or safalataa milti he
 According to the experts of astrology to wear Rudraksha, there are some special ways to use Rudraksha to overcome the struggles in life
 in upayon ko agar kade niyamon ke saath kiya jaae to shani pidaa se mukti milti he
 Let's know about the rules for wearing Rudraksha
 
 
 - rudraksh ko kalai, galaa or hriday par dhaaran kiya ja saktaa he
 - It is best to wear it around the neck; 12 should be worn in the wrist, 36 in the neck and 108 in the heart
 - hriday tak lala dhaage main ek dana rudraksh dhaaran kar sakate hai
 - In Sawan, it is best to wear Rudraksha on Monday and on Shivaratri
 rudraksh dhaaran karne ke pehle use shiv ji ko samarpit karnaa chahie
 - Mantra should be chanted on the same rosary or Rudraksha
 - jo bhi rudraksh dhaaran kar rahaa he use satvik rahanaa chahie or aacharan shuddh na rakhane par rudraksh laabh nahin detaa
 Using Rudraksha for Saturn to deal with the pain of the pain, using Rudraksha with these rules gives quick relief
 ab aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki aakhir shani kii baadhaon ko dur karne liye kis tarah se rudraksh kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 Let us know how to solve every problem
 
 
 rojgaar kii samasya main- iske liye das mukhi rudraksh dhaaran karnaa chahie
 - Wear it around the neck in red thread on Saturday
 - ek saath 3 das mukhi rudraksh dhaaran karnaa phydemand hoga
 If there is a problem of health- for this, wear 8 Mukhi Rudraksha on the neck on Saturday
 - sirf aath mukhi rudraksh pahanen yaa phir ek saath 54 aath mukhi rudraksh pahanen
 Know whether to use which Rudraksh to overcome the sufferings found in Saturn's half-century or dhaiya
 
 
 - iske liye gale main rudraksh kii maala dhaaran karen ye maala agar paanch mukhi rudraksh kii ho to uttam hoga
 - Before wearing this mantra, chant the mantra of Shani and Shiva
 kundali main shani ke ashubh prabhaav se bachane ke liye- ek mukhi or gyaarah mukhi rudraksh ek saath dhaaran karen
 - Keep 1, one face and 2, eleven face Rudraksha in it
 - isko ek saath laal dhaage main dhaaran karen
 Astrologers say that this remedy of Rudraksha also ends the inauspicious yoga of Saturn present in the horoscope
 rudraksh main wo shakti he jo apane dharak ko har tarah kii pareshaani se ladane kii kshamta detaa he or unako dur karata he
 Hopefully you too will get special benefit from these experiments of Rudraksha

 shatrughna sinha or rajesh khanna
 Both actors were very good friends
 magar ek chunaav ne inke bich kadavaahat paidaa kar di
 The issue is 23 years old
 1991 main bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani ne congress ke rajesh khanna ko nai dilli loksabhaa seat par bahut kam maton se chunaav haraaya
 Advani also contested from Gandhinagar seat in Gujarat
 so yah seat khaali kar di
 BJP fielded Shatrughan Sinha in the by-election
 sinha rajesh khanna ke saamne buree tarah khet rahe
 But despite this victory, Rajesh Khanna had a tear
 unka apana dost unke khilaaf khadaa hua
 And Shatrughan
 unhen ye malaal rahaa ki vah kakaaji ke paas jaakar sori nahin bol paae
 For that election
 jab laga ki ab bol hi dena chahie, tab kaaka bahut biimaar the
 Were admitted in ICU
 phir ek din shatrughna kii beti sonakshi ne papa ko bataaya
 Kakaji is no more
 ek baar phir chunaav chal rahe hai
 Now Shatrughan Sinha is in the fray from the Pataliputra seat of Bihar
 sitting empi bhi hai
 And he told this sorry story himself
 vah bhi tab, jab unke khilaaf chunaav ladgaye vaala ek actor sori bolne laga
 These were Shekhar Suman, who was on the Congress ticket against Shatrughan for the last time
 ek hi mohalle ke donon chorepatna ke ek hi mohalle kadamkuan ke rahane vaale hai shatrughna or shekhar
 There was a good friendship between the two
 magar chunavi takaraar ke baad kuch faasale aa gaye
 Shekhar Suman again bridged it
 unhone sinha ko bataur mehmaan bulaayaa
 The occasion was Shekhar Suman's mother's 88th birthday
 is dauraan donon sitaron ne apane gile shikave khul kar dur kiye or kuch baaten bhi bataayin
 During this time, Sinha mentioned the wounds of contesting elections against Kakaji
 shekhar ne congress ko kaha khamoshshekhar suman ne party kii shuruyaat main hi pichley chunaav main shatrughna ke khilaaf chunaav ladane ke liye maafee maangi
 He said that i made a mistake, who contested against elder brother
 unhone bataaya ki congress ne is baar phir unhen chunaav ladgaye kaa nyotaa diya tha
 But Shekhar used Shatrughan's dialogue and told the Congress, silent
 iske paas maa he, bole sinha or ro padeis bharat milaap ke dauraan ek baar shatrughna sinha kii ankhen bhi chhalak ain
 He said, we have many similarities
 dono patna ke ek hi mohalle ke hai, ek hi parivaar ke hai, ek hi field main hai
 But one thing that Shekhar Suman has and i do not have
 uske paas maa he
 After this emotional conversation, Shekhar Suman sang songs in the pride of Bihari Babu

 ) Party General Secretary Ashok Gehlot, who holds the number two position in the Congress, has once again given rise to the talk of becoming the Chief Minister of Rajasthan
 ashok gahalot ne ajmer main patrakaron se baat karte hue kaha, 'chaahe mujhe koi pad mili yaa na mili, lekin main rajasthan kii janata ke bich rahoonga
 The people of the state trusted me and gave lots of love
 main unke saath sadaiv rahoonga
 'political meanings are being extracted from Congress leader Gehlot's repeated statements
 congress bhi chaahati he ki ashok gahalot is tarah kaa bayaan dete rahen, taaki kisi ek chehre ke saath congress chunaav main na jaae
 In the name of both Sachin Pilot and Ashok Gehlot, votes should be sought in the assembly elections

 Ashok Gehlot described the bjp's campaign of Emergency as unfortunate and said that Indira Gandhi had imposed emergency in view of the situation of the time
 immergency ke dauraan hui jyaadati ke liye indira gandhi jimmedaar nahin hai
 Today's condition is worse than Emergency
 gahalot ne kaha ki bijepi indira gandhi kaa apmaan nahin kar rahi he, balki puure desh kii mahila shakti kii pratik indira gandhi kaa apmaan kar rahi he
 He said that this is an insult to the women of the country
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ne indira gandhi ko durga kaha tha
 The way BJP leaders LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Arun Shourie, Shatrughan Sinha and Ghanshyam Tiwari have come out, it can be understood by looking at how the BJP is acting dictatorially
 gahalotane kaha ki yahi bijepi he, jo immergency ke dauraan desh main gum-ghumkar sena or police ko sarkaar ke khilaaf baghawat karne or unke adeshon kii avhelnaa karne ke liye uksaa rahi thi
 One leader was shouting slogans to uproot the railway tracks

 Whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Amit Shah or Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje is acting like a dictator
 unhone kaha ki chunaav saamne aane vaale hai
 Seeing the BJP losing in Rajasthan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have decided to camp in the province, but the people of Rajasthan will bid them farewell this time
 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ko aade haathon lete hue gahalot ne kaha ki vasundhara ne up raashtrapati bhaerosingh shekhavat ko nahin bakhsha to ghanashyam tiwari or om maathur unke saamne kya he? vasundhara raaje ne ghanashyam tiwari kaa shoshan kar party se baahar jane par majaboor kar diya

 The result was that Australia set a huge target in front of India and Team India lost in the end

 vaise dekha jaae, to saaha kii pasand sahi bhi najar aati he, kyonki pune test main unhone jo kaich pakadaa tha, usamen riection time bahut kam tha, vah bhi gendbaaji par tej gendbaaj the
 He caught this catch off the bowling of fast bowler Umesh Yadav, which was of Matthew Wade
 umesh kii gend leg said main vade ke balle kaa kinaaraa chhukar peeche gai or saaha ne usko dahini ore dive lagaate hue lapka tha

 Since the spinner has a slower ball
 aise main unke paas riection samay pune kii tulana main zyada tha
 The catch was Australian batsman Steve o'keefe, who he caught by diving forward
 saaha ab australia ke adam gilcrist ke khilaaf khilne kii ichha rakhte hai, haalanki gilcrist ab sanyas le chuke hai
 In such a situation, Saha can only get a chance to play against him in the IPL
