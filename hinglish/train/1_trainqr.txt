 The blue light safari car of IG Anand Swaroop, stolen from Noida under suspicious circumstances, remains a secret till now
 police ke haath abhi tak us car kaa koi suraag nahin laga he
 IG Anand Swaroop, posted in ITBP, has kept silence in this matter so far
 koun he anand swaroopanand sparup 1992 batch ke ipies adhikari hai
 UP cadre IPS Anand Swaroop originally hails from Bihar
 anand ek tej tarraar ipies adhikari maane jate hai
 They do not like political interference in their work
 yahi vajah he ki baar-baar unke transfar hote rahe hai
 Just a few months ago, he was posted on deputation to ITBP as IG Mussoorie (uttarakhand)
 lekin bahut jald hi unka tabadalaa itibipi mukhyalay main kar diya gaya
 He has a private residence in Sector 23, Noida
 philhal, ve apane parivaar ke saath vahiin rahete hai
 How the theft took place: The car theft incident of IG Anand Swaroop from Sector 23, considered to be very safe in Noida, adjacent to Kardili, created a sensation in the entire area
 beeti 20 janvari ko unki neeli batti lagi nai tata safari car registration sankhya CH01-GA-2915 unke ghar ke baahar khadi thi
 Which was stolen after midnight
 police kaa kahana he kii chori raat 3 baje ke baad hui thi
 The safari car was captured on a CCTV camera while leaving there
 kya hui karrwikar chori kii vaardaat ek ipies adhikari ke ghar par hui thi
 Therefore, Noida Police immediately registered a case on the complaint of IG Anand Swaroop
 car ko talash karne ke liye police kii kai team banaai gai hai
 Footage of CCTV cameras mounted on several routes has also been searched
 lekin car chori hone ke lagbhag 27 din baad bhi police ke haath khaali hai
 According to Deputy SP Anoop Yadav, the police has received some information but nothing can be said exactly
 car ko talash kiya ja rahaa he
 The direction of the police investigation is towards Delhi
 anand swaroop ne sadhi chuppighar ke baahar se car chori ho jane ke baad se hi aiji anand swaroop ne chuppi saadh rakhi he
 They are not talking to the media about this
 aaj tak ne unase phone par sampark kiya or is sambandh main baat karne kii koshish kii lekin unki taraf se koi pratikriya nahin mili
 Many questions are also being raised about his silence
 police ne jari kiya tha alert26 janvari se thik pehle aiji anand swaroop kii car chori hone se police kii pareshaani bad gai thi
 An alert was also issued by the police in this regard
 taaki car ke bare main aas-paas ke rajyon ko bhi sartak kiya ja sake
 But despite the alert, there is no news of the car yet
 car chori ke baad uthe kai savaalpathankot hamale se pehle bhi gurdaspur ke espi kii neeli batti lagi car aatanki lut kar le gaye the
 Which he used to escape from the eyes of the police
 thik usee tarah se sandigdh halaat main aiji kii car chori hona apane aap main kai sawaal paidaa karata he
 For example, in the gated colony of Sector 23, where IG Anand Swaroop's house is, how can a common thief dare to steal a car
 jabaki safari car ke upar neeli batti bhi lagi thi
 There are 24-hour guards present at the gate
 car bilkul nai thi to usamen koi chaabi bagaiyr duplikisi ke nahin lag sakati thi
 If a stranger came inside the colony at 3 o'clock in the night, how would the guard let him go and if he let go, he would have made his entry as well
 yaa chor agar pehle se andar hi maujuud tha to guard ne car ke baahar jate vakt dekha kyon nahin ki car koun chalaa rahaa he
 At night all the colonies' gates are closed
 agar sisitivi camera footage main car jate hue dikh rahi he magar car chalaane vaala nahin to iskaa matlab he ki chori karne vaala pehle se hi saavdhaan tha
 He was avoiding the camera
 jisase lagata he ki chor yaa to colony se waakif tha yaa phir usne kai baar yahaan aakar reki kii thi
 According to the police, the car also went to the service center in Okhla on the same day due to a technical flaw
 kya police ne vahaan ke stoff se poochtacha kii
 If there are wires connected to the car theft then why has the police not said anything clearly in this case
 philhal, police or aiji anand swaroop kii chuppi ne is maamle ko or pechida bana diya he
 Until the case is revealed or the car is not found, the case will remain a major headache for the police

 isi sambandh main lans nayak anil baat karne ke liye rajesh ke ghar gaya

 Anil threatens Rajesh and instructs him not to do it again and returns

 ' China has repeatedly acknowledged that Mumbai was attacked by lashkar-e-taiba in 2008 for the first time in India's efforts to declare jaish-e-mohammed leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist and that it was the world's most frightening Is one of the attacks
 china ne sweekaar kiya he kimumbai par hua aatankwaadi hamalaa duniya ke ‘ati kukhyat' hamalon main se ek he
 In its white paper on the action being taken against militants in its troubled Xinjiang province, China said that the spread of terrorism and extremism on a global scale in the last few years has hurt humanity
 isi shwet patr main mumbai ke aatankwaadi hamale ko ‘‘ati kukhyat aatankwaadi hamalon'' main se ek bataaya gaya he

 In the midst of tax and inflation, few people would have noticed the announcement of the budget that the government is going to create a new project development company which is in south-east Asia countries Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam (CMLV)
 Will pave the way for private companies to invest
 bajet kaa yah prastaav sanket he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi gharelu morche par bhale hi ulajh rahe hon lekin global mahatvakankshaon ko lekar unki taiyaariyaan chaak-chauband hai
 Putting foreign policy on the back of private investment and the formation of a public company for this purpose is actually the PPP (public Private Partnership) model of diplomacy, which can give a new dimension to Indian international relations
 kootneeti kii yah nai karavat hind mahaasaagar ke dweepiya deshon main pradhanmantri kii taaja yatra kii roshni main khaasi mahatvapurn ho gai he
 The redesign of India's diplomatic strategy derives from the policies of Modi's latest global campaigns
 pradhanmantri ko bhavuk bhartiyata or bharatvanshiyon se judaav kii simaaon kaa ehsaas hone laga he
 Strategic discourse of global security and solidarity can connect big countries, but relations with small countries cannot be filled with grandeur like relations with superpowers
 inhen to thos aarthik len-dein kii jameen par tikaana hota he jiskaa koi majboot model bharat ke paas nahin he
 In foreign policy, Modi wants to set a different pattern of relations with big and small countries so that global ambitions can be realized in a holistic manner
 seychelles, morishas or srilanka jaise chote deshon se unke pehle samvaad ke nattejey is ranneeti ke liye kaaphi ahm honge
 Due to the dominance of the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean regions on the global board, the Indian Ocean is not only out of the discussions but has also become a museum of passive diplomatic experiments in the last 25 years
 kareeb 1
 The SAARC, which connects a population of 5 billion people, has not been able to form a dynamic framework of dialogue, far more than two dozen summits since 1985
 1997 main thailand kii aguai main bana saat deshon kaa bikvastek-isi (be of bengal initiative for multi sectoral technical and iconomic kooparation) ko ek sachivalay banane main 17 saal lag gaye

 When Narendra Modi is making a new start in this field, then the failure of these big diplomatic experiments is also fought on his back
 ye vifaltaaen bharat ke khate main sirf isliye nahin chamakati hai ki vah hind mahaasaagar ke kinare maujuud sabase bada mulk he balki isliye bhi mahatvapurn hai kyonki hind mahaasaagar va shesh vishwa main chote mulkon se sambandhon kaa koi thos praaroop bharat ke paas nahin he
 Indian diplomacy did not progress beyond stipends, tourism and line of credit to students in relationships with these small countries
 saanskrithik sambandhon kii duhai bhi ek seemaa tak kaam aati he
 For younger countries, friendship means direct participation in their growth
 yahi vajah thi ki china kii kootneeti nivesh kii peeth par baith kar aage badi
 China has directly affected the economic interests of many small countries from the Indian Ocean to Africa and Europe through foreign exchange reserves and large state-owned companies
 bharat ke paas videshi mudra bhandar kii takat nahin he jiske jariye chote deshon main nivesh kiya ja sake
 Governments have a limited share in the business, so efforts between governments in the Indian Ocean region did not pan out
 yahi vajah he ki modi apni kootnithik safalataa ke liye bharat kii nijee companiyon kii taraf mukhaatib hai
 The announcement of a new company that paved the way for investment in East Asia before traveling to the Indian Ocean is an attempt to show that China wants to do the work done by private companies in small countries with its large state-owned companies
 narendra modi ne seychelles, morishas va srilanka kii baithkon main is nai pahal kaa zikr jarur kiya hoga, kyonki pradhanmantri ke srilanka pahunchane se pehle hi bhartiya udyog ke captainon kii ek team colombo pahunch gai thi
 This was the largest gathering of executives of Indian companies in a small country in recent years
 nijee nivesh ko kootneeti se jodgaye kaa yah prayog keval purvi asia tak simit nahin rahegaa
 Modi will do the same experiment for the Indian Ocean and such an effort will also be seen in his visit to Africa
 bharat kii nijee companiyaan or videsh main based bharatvanshi, modi ke global abhiyaan kaa aadhaar banate dikh rahe hai
 The challenge is that India's private companies are too small on the global scale
 modi kii kootnithik yojanaon main madad ke liye unhen global saakh, takat, paardarshita or bada aakaar chahie, taaki laos, cambodia se lekar morishas or seychelles tak kaarobaari jokhim liye ja saken
 On the other hand, nris can only brighten the shining India, cannot invest like rich Chinese settled abroad
 pradhanmantri videshi manchon se chaahe jitne bhavuk aahvaan karen lekin hind mahaasaagar bhraman ke baad unhen is hakeekat kaa ehsaas bhi ho jayega ki unki global mahatvakankshaon ko bharat main acchhee gavarnence or tej growth kii buniyaad chahie
 Without this, neither private companies will be active nor will their murid Indians be active
 videshi manch se bharat ko sambodhan bahut hua, ab modi ko desh kii jameen se videsh ko sambodhit karnaa hoga

 Rishabh Pant was dismissed for 19 against South Africa in the third T20 match played in Bengaluru

 Team India head coach Ravi Shastri also said that if Rishabh Pant keeps repeating the mistakes made during the West Indies tour, then he will have to bear the brunt of it

 Elder Mahant Mahant Divyagiri, 41 years Mankameshwara Temple, Lucknow Bhagavata Clothing, Gutta wrapped in hair, Saffron Safa covering the head and neck parts and a long rosary of Rudraksha in the throat
 mahant divyagiri kii chhavi ab barabanki kii pathology kii yuva chaatra se bilkul alag he
 When she came to the Mankameshwar temple in Lucknow, then she stayed there and got the seat of the chief priest
 pehle unhen arunima singh ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Then she wanted to study pathology after passing the brilliant student XII but the parents were not ready to send her out of Barabanki for higher education
 aakhirkaar ve maan gaye or 1998 main arunima pathology main diploma karne dilli pahunch gayi
 Despite her faith in God, Arunima did not visit temples regularly
 diploma karne ke baad, vah apni pathology laboretory kholana chaahati thi
 So, he started visiting the labs of Lucknow to see the work of Path Lab
 2000 main ek din unke ek paariwarik mitra or mankameshwar mandir ke tatkaaleen mahant keshavadas maharaj ke shishy arunima ko gomti ke tat par bane kareeb 1,000 saal puraane shiv mandir main le gaye
 Arunima came back to this temple alone
 shivlinga ke samaksh ve dhyaan main baith gayi or achaanak unhen ek divya anubhuti hui
 She says, "suddenly everything changed for me
 mere andar ab pathology lab kholane kii ichha shesh na rahi
 Now i just wanted to stay in this temple
 '' arunima ghar ain or mata-pita ko apane faisle ke bare main bataaya
 They agreed after the initial na-nukur
 arunima ke liye asli chunauti to ab shuru huiah maankameshwar peeth ne kisi mahila ko shishy ke rup main rahane kii anumati nahin di
 She explains, "keshav Das Maharajji remained adamant on his stand for three months but i would go every morning and request
 '' janvari 2001 main, aakhirkaar arunima ko paanch santon kii upasthiti main sanyasin banaaya gaya
 He got a new name: Divyagiri
 baat yaheen aakar nahin thami
 In 2008, the ailing Mahanta Keshavdas proposed the name of Divyagiri as his successor

 But Shankaracharya Swami Narendra Saraswati of Sri Kashi Sumeru Peeth supported him

 '' sarkaar ne notebandi or cashles atm se logon ko raahat dene ke liye big-bazaar or petrol pump main bhi cash nikaalane kaa intjaam kiya gaya he
 But this scheme of the government is now under threat
 kyonki abhi tak big bazaar or petrol pump apane hi cirkulation kaa cash swip mashin skim ke tahat de rahe hai lekin nae noton kii kami is skim ko flop kar sakati he
 On Saturday, when banks closed and atms became cashless, Big Bazaar's cash counter also tricked people
 yahaan tak ki petrol pump se card swip kar paisa nikalnaa bhi ab naammumkin sa ho gaya he
 The Big Bazaar outlets of Noida's GIP Mall have a board set up to withdraw cash
 jis par saaf saaf likhaa he ki teen tareekon se cash nikaala ja saktaa he or iske liye sweaping mashin main apane debit card kaa number daaliye or cash counter par baithne vaala shaks aapako do hajaar rupee pakadaa degaa
 But there were technical flaws in withdrawing cash from Big Bazaar, which made the people who came to big-bazaar to wait for a cash withdrawal soon
 darasal esbiai mashin kaa sarwar down hone kii vajah se jiipi ke big bazaar outlet par subah-subah cash nikaalane pahunche logon ko kareeb 2 ghante intjaar karnaa padaa
 Despite this, people are very happy with the Big Bazaar cash policy because they are getting the opportunity to use the air-condition facility here as well
 vaise sweaping mashin se cash kaa system petrol pump par bhi lagu kiya gaya he lekin abhi tak petrol pump par sweaping mashin dekhne ko nahin mil rahi he
 Although the owners of petrol pumps say that the banks have made arrangements for swapping machines but due to non-availability of cash, they are not able to provide this facility to the people
 ol india petroleum dilers association ke president ajay bansal ke mutabik petrol pump abhi tak logon ko sweaping mashin ke jariye cash de rahaa tha lekin ab cash uplabdh karanapetrol pampake liye mushkil he
 In fact, three big banks at the petrol pump had promised to make cash available from the swapping machine
 lekin abhi tak sirf ek hi bank cash uplabdh karvaa rahaa he or wo bhi sirf ek lakh rupee
 Which is proving to be equal to the cumin in the camel's mouth at these petrol pumps
 itnaa hi nahin petrol pump par500 rupayeki puraani karansi lene kii vajah se pump ke paas nai karansi nahin pahunch rahi he
 That is why it is almost impossible for a petrol pump to give new currency to people even after swiping the card through a swipe machine
 philhal petrol pump par raahat sirf itani he ki yahaan aapke puraane 500 rupee ke note chal rahe hai
 Now it has to be seen what steps the government takes to run the scheme to withdraw cash from the swipe machine at Big Bazaar and petrol pumps

 unhone digvijay singh par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki digvijay azamgarh ke tirthayatri hai or unhen yaheen aakar batla house kii yaad aati he

 He said that this decision of Congress is not only against the constitution and morality but it is also against the core elements of the brotherhood of Islam and a casteless society
 unhone kaha ki jo musalmaan aarakshan kaa laabh lete hai unhen dharmantaran se pehle ke apane mul dharm main waapas janaa hoga
 Uma questioned the Congress, 'does it want to give India the status of Hindu nation by arranging religion-based reservation, which we have never advocated
 ’unhone kaha ki dharm aadhaarit raashtra main hi dharm aadhaarit aarakshan kii vyavastha hoti he
 Demanding the withdrawal of religion-based reservation, he said that even the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, opposed it
 bijepi shasit karnataka sahit kuch rajyon main pehle se hi dharm aadhaarit aarakshan kii vyavastha vidyaman rahane ke prashnon se kanni katate hue unhone kaha ki jahaan pehle se aisi vyavastha he us bare main vahaan kii sarkaron ko tay karnaa he
 The Center has decided to give four and a half percent of the OBC 27 percent reservation quota to the minorities before announcing the assembly elections
 ab congress kah rahi he ki ise 9 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he
 Uma also lambasted SP, RJD and BSP chiefs Mulayam Singh, Lalu Prasad and Mayawati as to why they have remained silent on the breach in the OBC quota

 The Hodramalala seated party wrote to the PM regarding rights and supremacy in the trust
 The Triloki of Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas also claimed that the Supreme Court has given its verdict on the Ram temple case in Ayodhya and the central government has a trust in 3 months for the construction of the Ram temple
 The order to create was also heard, but before the trust is formed, the race for authority and domination in the trust has started
 trust banane ke baad ramalala kii puja paath or bhoga raag koun karegaa, isko lekar pujari banane kii nai jang bhi shuru ho gai he
 a letter has also been written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the appointment of Ram temple priest
 ramalala virajman pakshakaar or ram janmabhumi nyaas main sadsy triloki nath pandey ne bhi pujari banane ke liye apana daawa thok diya he
 The letter sent to the Prime Minister of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the receiver of Ram Mandir in the Ram Mandir triggered the competition and domination of becoming a priest
 patr main unhone 1949 main apane guru baba abhiram das ke ram mandir kaa pujari hone kaa zikr karte hue unke khilaaf pujari hote hue darj hue mukademe or iske aadhaar par mandir or masjid pakshakaron dwaara unako pujari maanate hue party banane kaa ullekh kiya he
 The letter also sought to make himself a trustee and a priest, saying that the Supreme Court in his order has considered his guru Baba Abhiram Das as the then priest
 isi aadhaar par unhone usee parampara or kanoon kaa hawala dekar gathit hone vaale trust main khud ko trustee or pujari banane kii maang kii he
 Mahant Dharmadas, the party's proponent of Ram temple, says that we have sent a letter to Prime Minister Modi
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko bhi vahi patr diya he
 Has also given to the commissioner
 isamen hamane yah kaha he ki ram janmabhumi main 1949 se baba abhiram das pujari the
 FIR was registered in his name
 exiaar ke baad jitne muslim paksh the un sabane baba abhiram das ko party banaaya
 We did not sue
 inhen logon ne ham par mukadmaa kiya
 The claim of becoming a priest was shocking
 He further said that we, from Muslims to priests, Bhaskar Das of Nirmohi Akhara had said in his statement that Baba Abhiram Das was a priest
 uske baad devakinandan agarwal ne apane mukademe main kaha ki baba abhiram das maah ke mukhya pujari the to sari vyavastha hamaare paksh main rahi
 The court agreed that is why i gave an application to make arrangements for the priest in the trust and in Ram Janmabhoomi
 bhartiya samskruti or sadhu samaaj kii suraksha karne or bhagwaan ram kii seva karne ke liye daayitv diya jaae
 i have applied to become a priest, whatever test will be made will be seen
 is bich ek or dilachasp maamla aayaa he
 Presently, the priest of the Ram temple is Acharya Satyendra Das who is the elder brother of Mahant Dharmadas i
e
 Acharya Satyendra Das and Mahant Dharmadas are disciples of the same Guru Baba Abhiram Das
 ab aise main ram janmabhumi ke mukhya pujari satyendra das apane guru bhai dwaara pujari banane kaa daawa thokane ko lekar achambhit hai, lekin vah bade sadhe andaaj main kehete hai ki vah to 27 saal se un ramalala kii puja kar rahe hai jisaki sabase pehle puja archana unke apane guru baba abhiram das ne shuru kii thi lihaaja vah to apane guru kii parampara ko hi aage badha rahe hai or isi aadhaar par unka chayan hua tha
 Maybe their Guru Bhai is talking about carrying on the same tradition, but they should demand that when the elder Guru Bhai is a priest then there is no need for the younger Guru Bhai
 pujari satyendra das kamishnar ke karmchaariah trilokidonon guru bhaaiyon ke bich pujari banane kii varchasv kii hode ke bich ramalala virajman ke pakshakaar or ramajnmabhumi nyaas ke sadsy triloki nath pandey kii bhi entry ho gai he
 He directly called the current priest Satyendra Das as the employee of the commissioner and said that he is the employee who gets the salary, the priest will form the trust, while Mahant Dharmadas used to be his friend during the trial till the High Court, but now Some people are misled and do not know who is guiding them
 pujari banane ke vivaad main ek or twist he or yah nayaa twist paidaa kiya he ramalala virajman paksh ke pakshakaar or ram janmabhumi nyaas ke sadsy triloki nath pandey ne
 When it came to Ramlala to become a priest, he too expressed his suppressed desire and said that what is lacking in him that he cannot be a priest
 daawa to unka bhi he or agar koi unka daawa naa maane tab bhi unki ichha to he hi ramalala kaa pujari banane kii
 Triloki Nath Pandey said, 'trustees will go through the process of choosing the priest
 pehle trust to saamne aae
 Ramlala will have a grand and divine arrangement
 raag bhoga chadhaava jo vaishno vidhi se hota he usee parampara se nirvahan hoga
 The priest will appoint a trust
 pujari banane kaa daawa har vyakti ko karne kaa adhikaar he
 i also claim that i should be his priest
 mujhamen aisi koun si kami he ki main pujari nahin ban saktaa
 This is not a claim, but i definitely do
 'puure prakaran par vishwa hindu parishad ke pravaktaa sharad sharma ne bhi ram mandir ke vartmaan pujari satyendra das or dharmadas par nishaanaa sadhate sadhate apane hi saathi or ramalala virajman kepakshakarko bhi aainaa dikhaane main der nahin kii
 Ramanand sect's priest: VHP VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma said that the current priest is an employee appointed by the commissioner and gets paid for his work
 ram mandir kaa pujari to sarvagun sampann, vaidic reeti rivaaj ko maanane vaala brahmacharya kaa paalan karne vaala nipun or ramanand sampradaay kaa vyakti hona chahie
 On the same lines, worship should be done in the same manner as in Mata Vaishno Devi and Balaji Tirupati
 ram mandirmen puja paath bhoga raag kaa adhikaar maangane ke liye hi nirmohi akhaada ram mandir kaa mukadmaa lard rahaa tha ab jabaki supreme court ne nirmohi akhaade ko bhi ram mandir ke prabandh tantra main hissedaar yani gathit hone vaale trust main bhagidaari dene kaa aadesh diya he
 Nirmohi Akhara has sought a meeting to meet Prime Minister Modi to ascertain his responsibility by meeting the Panchs
 aisi dasha main yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki ram mandir ke pujari banane kii hode aakhir kitni dur tak jaati he or vaad vivaad kaa yah silsilaa aage chalakar kya kya rang dikhaata he

 Singh said that no challan of his car has been cut and he called the constable himself and asked for an address, during which someone took the picture and spread the wrong news
 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main bijepi saansad ne kaha ki vah chhot vaali shrenee se aate hai or is lihaaj se unka chaalaan cat bhi nahin saktaa
 He said, 'I did not cut any invoice
 yah sach he kimeri gaadi sam sankhyawali he, lekin main niyam main chhot vaali shrenee se aata hum

 Let the law do its work

 Of course, no one should take the law in their own hands

 skulon main bacchon ko milane vaale naashte or khanpan se jude sarkari nirdesh kaa paalan na hone kii shikaayatein saamne aa rahi hai
 After scrutiny in many schools, it is learned that the children are unable to get their morning breakfast as the schools are ignoring the government instructions
 desh ke dur-daraaj ilaakon kii baat to dur, rajdhani dilli main bhi kai shikaayatein saamne ai hai
 Delhi High Court has also taken cognizance of this
 kuch vakt pehle hi adaalat ne dilli ke sarkari skulon main inspection karavaaya jisamen behad chaunkaane or dukhi karne vaale nattejey saamne aae
 Inspection found that about 40 percent of the children studying in Delhi's government schools and municipal corporations do not have breakfast in the morning
 garib pariwaron ke in 40 fisadi bacchon ko na to ghar se kuch khaane ko miltaa he or na hi skool aane ke baad naashtaa diya jaataa he
 According to an estimate, about 15 to 16 lakh children study in Delhi government schools, while in MCD schools this number is around 8 lakh
 in 24 lakh bacchon main subah kii pari main 12 lakh bachche aate hai or inamen se kisi ko bhi subah kaa naashtaa skool se nahin miltaa
 Whereas 40 percent of them i
e
 about 5 lakh children are forced to study hungry in the morning due to not getting anything from home
 2013 main bane neshnal food security act main saaf taur par likhaa he ki mid de mile se pehle bacchon ko subah main snekes die jane chahie
 This rule was made because Parliament also knew that the financial condition of the families of children coming to government schools is bad due to which a large number of children are unable to bring breakfast
 ab jo jaankaree saamne aa rahi he, uske mutabik food security act ke praavdhaanon ko dhata bataate hue na to dilli sarkaar or na hi emsidi ke skool main bacchon ko subah kaa naashtaa diya ja rahaa he
 This situation is considered to be worse because the Delhi government claims to do a lot of work in the field of education and reforms at the basic level
 dilli ke shiksha mantri manish sisodiya bhi aksar is daawey par jor dete dekhe ja sakate hai, lekin sachai kuch or bayaan kar rahi he
 It is easy to understand what the condition of food will be when the news of such a big shock is coming in schools in the morning breakfast

 jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay (JNU) main fees vruddhi va naye hostel niyamon ke khilaaf chal rahe pradarshan ke baad guuruuvaar ko naye vivaad ne janm le liya he
 This new case is about tampering with the statue of Swami Vivekananda
 akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (ABVP) ne aarope lagaaya he ki jeenyu main gaiyr-anavarit vivekanand kii murti ko kshatigrast karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 Let us know that many slogans were written around this statue for the BJP, although the administration has cleared it
 abivipi ne kaha ki saarvajanik sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchaana left chaatr sanghathanon kaa maansik diwaliyapan dikhaata he
 ABVP JNU unit president Durgesh Kumar said that the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad had already pointed out that activists associated with leftist student organizations like ISA, SFI, DSF, AISF underestimated their petty political interests under the guise of the JNU movement Are not meant by the university
 akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad ke pradesh mantri siddharth yadav ne kaha ki swami vivekanand ne aadhunik bharat ko disha dikhaane main behad mahatvapurn yogadan diya he, unhen kisi vaicharik khaanche main baitaakar nahin dekha ja saktaa
 But the manner in which the people of the Left tried to damage his statue is very unfortunate
 aise abhartiya vichaaron ko ham bharat ke sabhi campason main se khatm kar dene tak ladenge
 We demand from the administration that strict action should be taken against those who are involved in the attempt to damage the statue of Swami Vivekananda
 abhavip jeenyu ke ikai adhyaksh durgesh kumaar or sachiv manish jangid ne sanyukt bayaan main kaha ki jeenyu kaa aam chaatr jab apane adhikaron ke liye sangharshrat he, tab thik usee samay left apane flop ho chuke agenda ko jivit karne kaa asafal prayaas kar rahaa he
 Is the way the entire university was dirty and public property damaged? Is it not the responsibility of all of us students to secure the public property of the university? This act is going to take the movement in the wrong direction, which we will not allow to succeed
 hamaari ladaai hostel minial waapas karaane kii he, isaki aad main left ke apane ativaadee vichaaron ko thopanaa kaa prayaas aam chaatr kabhi safal nahin hone degaa
 Conspiracy to misuse the ABVP movement is a conspiracy: The JNU Students' Union JNU has released its statement saying that our agitation against fee hike has drafted a hostel manual without consulting the students for authoritarian methods of administrative work
 There is a democratic movement against
 fees vruddhi ke kaaran apane bhavishya ko daanv par lagane vaale chaatr kabhi kisi hinsa yaa aloktantric karrwai ke apradhi nahin ho sakate
 We condemn such wrong attempts under the guise of JNU student movement
 jeenyu chaatr samudaay apane naam par kiye gaye kisi galat krity kaa samarthan nahin karata he
 Whoever does this is doing it in his own name and should not use the name of the movement to justify such acts
 is tarah kaa krity vishvavidhyalay ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh he
 This is the work of right-wing people
 visi, sattarudh shashan or campus main maujuud abivipi ke log fees vruddhi ke mudde ko vyarth or dhruvikaran vaali bahes main modana chaahate hai
 The so-called roll back of the fee hike is a fantasy
 jo sarvice or utility chargeej pehle jiro the wo bhi ab jod die gaye hai
 The gimmick of giving relief to BPL students is also a lie as they are going to use the fee hike
 jeenuasu ne kaha ki is prakaar hamen vaastavik muddon se hataane kaa prayaas safal nahin hoga
 JNUSU appeals to the student community not to exercise restraint and encourage such negligence

 The Ministry of External Affairs has expressed happiness over the announcement of Masood Azhar, the leader of jaish-e-mohammed, the perpetrator of several terror attacks, including Pulwama and Uri
 haalanki jab unase sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad faisle main pulavama aatanki hamale kaa zikr nahin kiye jane kaa sawaal kiya gaya, to videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit kiya janaa pakistan ke liye tagada jhatka he
 This is Pakistan's biggest diplomatic defeat
 ab isse dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye tarah-tarah kii baaten kahi ja rahi hai
 He said Masood Azhar has been banned by the United Nations Security Council
 yah pratibandh masood ajahar kii aatanki gatividhiyon kaa biodata nahin he
 Masood Azhar has been banned for not only one, but for carrying out several terrorist activities
 hamaara makasad kisi bhi tarah masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karaane kaa tha, jisamen ham safal rahe
 In fact, on February 14, there was a terrorist attack on CRPF convoy in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, in which more than 40 soldiers were killed
 is hamale kii jimmedaari khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne lee thi

 He has no choice but to just count a few flaws
 unhone kaha, 'ham aatankwaad or desh kii suraksha se jude muddon par kisi bhi desh se samjhauta nahin karte hai
 The process of declaring Masood Azhar as a global terrorist started in 2009
 aapako bataa den ki china ke adnga hataane ke baad buudhvaar ko sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ne masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit kar diya
 However, the decision to declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist does not mention the Pulwama terror attack
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha, 'china ke adnga hataane ke kadam kaa ham swaagat karte hai
 China has contributed to include Masood Azhar in the list of global terrorists
 isse bharat ke saath uske rishte majboot honge
 In response to a question, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that China itself has explained why it has removed the technical barrier imposed in declaring Masood Azhar a terrorist? Ravish Kumar said that the UN Security Council decision on terrorist Masood Azhar is a step in the right direction

 You have been a terrific ambassador for the game & a thorough gentleman
 Warm welcome to the club of the Retired! Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi filled the nomination papers for the Lok Sabha elections from Amethi
 apni maa or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi, bahan priyanka or bahanoi robert wadra ke saath colectrate pahunche rahul ne jila nirvachan adhikari jagatraj tiwari ke samaksh namakan daakhil kiya
 Rahul's proponents included Jagadishpur MLA Radheshyam Kanaujia, former Congress District President Prem Narayan Tiwari, Congress Seva Dal leader Rajnarayan Yadav and party worker Mohammad Naeem
 namakan daakhil karne ke baad samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main rahul ne kaha ki unka amethi se paariwarik rishta he or unhen acchhee jeet hasil hogi
 He said, i am working in Amethi
 bahut khushi hoti he isamen
 Especially have worked deeply on three things
 mahilaon ke liye swayan sahaayta samooh ke jariye kaam kiya he
 Uttar Pradesh has added 10 lakh women
 unki aamadani badi
 Second, milk is done
 food park ke madhyam se ham amethi ke kisaan ko baaki duniya se jodna chaahate hai
 That was a big job
 teesraa, amethi ko railway line, tathaa rashtriya rajmarg se jodne kaa kaam
 i will add more depth in the coming time
 isse purv, vimaan ke jariye pahunche rahul or unki maa congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi amhat hawaii pattee par utarane ke baad namakan karne se pehle rodsho ke liye nikle
 Priyanka and her husband Robert Vadra, who landed at Fursatganj airport, also reached Amhat by car and joined the roadshow

 During this time, supporters welcomed him with rain and slogans of flower petals
 amethi main 7 may ko matdaan he
 BJP has fielded Smriti Irani against Rahul Gandhi in Amethi, while Kumar Vishwas is contesting on behalf of the Aam Aadmi Party
 agar amethi kii pahchaan rahul gandhi ke parivaar se he, to bhaajapa kii smriti irani bhi 'saas bhi kabhi bahu thi' main kirdaar nibhaane ke kaaran ghar-ghar main pahchaan rakhti hai

 Reacting to Sonia's sarcasm that he is promising to make India a paradise, she said, "I never said that i will make India a paradise and i have a solution to all the problems
" main aashwast hum ki log bhi mujhase yah ummid nahin karte

 'lekin yah sansthagat tareeke se niyamit prakriya ke jariye hona chahie jisamen kisi bhi varg kii ore se hastkshep nahin ho

 ' (dekhen : narendra modi ne rahul ke bhaashan ko bataaya 'kamedi') At the same time, Modi was asked if he would try to contact powerful regional leaders like Mamata Banerjee, Jayalalithaa and Mayawati who have been criticizing him during the election campaign, but after the results of the election, he (modi) had to May need support

 Meanwhile, Savarkar's grandson Ranjit Savarkar said that former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was also a follower of Savarkar
 ranjit saavarkar ne kaha,'indira gandhi ne vir saavarkar ko sammanit kiya tha
 i strongly feel that she (indira) was a follower, because she (indira) brought Pakistan to its knees
 sena or videshi sambandhon ko majboot kiya or unhone parmaanu pareekshan bhi kiya
 All this is against the philosophy of Nehru and Gandhi
 'ranjeet,grandson of Veer savarkar:owaisi should follow Savarkar's belief that keep religion in your house,when out you are not Hindu or Muslim but Indian

 Savarkar wanted that whoever enters Parliament should exclude caste, religion, gender etc
 aap saavarkar se zyada dharmanirpeksh aadmi nahin khoj paaenge
 In fact, recently All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi had said that how can it be thought of giving Bharat Ratna to a conspirator who killed the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi
 agar aap saavarkar ko de rahe hai to nathuram godse ko bhi bharat ratna den
 What is the matter? In Maharashtra, BJP has promised to get Bharat Ratna to Veer Savarkar in his resolution letter
 mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne kaha ki unki sarkaar centre sarkaar se ye maang karegi ki vir saavarkar ko bharat ratna diya jaae

 australia ke khilaaf (india vs Australia) chaar test match kii siries (test Series) ke pehle har kisi kaa anumaan tha ki michel stork kii aguwai vaali tej gendbaaj tikdi, bhartiya ballebaaji kii kathin pariksha le sakati he
 There were also substantial reasons behind this estimation
 australia ke paas michel stork, josh hejalwood or pat kamins ke rup main tej gendbaajon kii behtareen tikdi he or bharpoor oochaal or movement ke kaaran videshi maidaanon par (asia ke baahar) tej gendbaajon kaa saamana karnaa bhartiya ballebaajon ke liye hameshaa mushkil sabit hota rahaa he
 However, this conjecture proved to be completely wrong and in both Test matches so far, the off-spinner Nathan Lyon has caused problems for Indian batsmen
 perth ke duusare test main jeet hasil karte hue australia team ne siries main 1-1 kii barabari hasil kar lee he or is jeet main leone donon tiimon ke bich bada fark sabit hue the
 Nathan Lyon also performed brilliantly in the first test at Adelaide Oval
 bhartiya team ne is test main 31 ran se jeet hasil kar siries main 1-0 kii badhat hasil kii thi lekin australia ne perth main jeet hasil karte hue maamla baraabar kar diya
 Saurav Ganguly said, India has a chance to defeat Australia but this warning was given
 
 
 bhartiya team ke purv captain saurav ganguli (sourav Ganguly) kaa maananaa he ki bhartiya ballebaaj, nathan leone (nathan Lyon) kii gendbaaji ke prati jarurat se adhik sammaan darsha rahe hai or is kaaran is spinner ko haaavee hone kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 During a conversation with India TV, Ganguly said that Indian batsmen should adopt an attack policy against Leon
 unhone kaha ki bharat ke ballebaajon ne leone ke prati atyadhik sammaan dikhaaya or unki of stump ke baahar kii gendon ko bhi rakshaatmak andaaj main khelaa
 Sourav Ganguly said, 'I thought of sending a text message to Virat Kohli, though i have not sent it yet
 main kohli se kahana chahta tha ki unki ballebaajon ko asia ke baahar spinneron ko zyada wicket nahin dena chahie
 Although Sourav acknowledged that Nathan Lyon is a great spinner, he said that Shane Warne, Muttiah Muralitharan and Graeme Swan were also big spin bowlers
 ganguli ke anusaar, bhartiya ballebaaj leone kii of stump ke baahar kii gendon ko bhi dephend karke is spinner ke prati jarurat se zyada sammaan dikhaa rahe hai
 He said, 'I believe the batsmen should be more aggressive against them
 bhartiya ballebaajon kaa dhyaan 300 yaa 350 ran se adhik score banane par dhyaan dena chahie
 'leone has taken 8-8 wickets in both Test matches so far
 edilade test main unhone ballebaaji main bhi acha pradarshan kiya tha
 Nathan Lyon 31 in 82 Tests so far
 60 ke ausat se 334 wicket hasil kar chuke hai

 reatin4 starkalakaaradipika padukon, priyanka chopra, ranvir singh, mahesh manjrekar or tanvi azmidiarectorsanjay lila bhansaliishk, dard or ek trikon, jinhen bhavyata ke angan main parosa jaataa he
 This is the eternal formula of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's films
 'bajirao mastaani'bhi sanjay lila bhansaali tip filmon kii agali kadi he
 In which Deepika, Priyanka and Ranveer have a love triangle
 larger dain life sets he
 There are mesmerizing opportunities, and a lot of glass is used that dazzles the film
 unhone is baar maratha peshwa bajirao or bundelkhand ke raja chhatrasaal kii beti mastaani kii kahani ko chunaa he jo marathi lekhak en
 s
 inaamdaar kii kitaab 'rau' par aadhaarit he
 However, the film seems to swing between historicity and love story
 lekin isamen koi doraay nahin ki film main najar yah saaf najar aayaa he ki ishk jab had se guzar jaae to vah junun ban jaataa he, or deepika ne bakhubi ise screen par jiya bhi he
 The talk of the story is expert in everything from Peshwa to Ranveer Singh warfare to scripture
 uski ek khubasurat or pyaar karne vaali bivi kaashi bai yani priyanka chopra he
 Mastani Yannidipika seeks help from Padukonbajirao for an expedition, and, showing her bravery, she finds a place in Ranveer's heart
 lekin ek din ranvir se anjaane main ek bhul ho jaati he, or deepika us bhul ko sach maanakar sweekaar kar leti he
 Loses herself to Bajirao
 udhar, is bhul kaa sidhaa asar peshwa kii patni kashibai par padataa he or apane bajirao par bharosa karne vaali bivi kii duniya hi hill jaati he
 In this way a love story is born, then there is a crisis on the existence of a wife
 is sabake bich dharm kaa sawaal paidaa hota he to rajnatik pratishtha or sammaan kii baaten bhi saamne aati hai
 The story of the film seems a bit drawn in many places, but Mastani ignores this
 star apiladipika ne mastanibankar ek baar phir sabit kar diya he ki agar vah apane kaam ko dil se karen to role main jaan daalane kaa hunar unhen aata he
 The passion he has shown for Ishq is amazing
 vaaki is film main mastaani bahut hi divaani lagi hai
 In 'bajirao Mastani', the style and look that Sanjay Leela Bhansali gave Deepika goes deep into her heart
 phir sanjay kii film kii heroine to vaise bhi dil jeetne kaa hunar jaanati hai
 Deepika has been fantastic, at some places in the film, she has been seen to be heavy on Ranveer and everything else
 ranvir singh ne bhi acha kaam kiya he
 He is good as a warrior
 unhone acha ection kiya he
 Her chemistry with Deepika is also amazing
 vah film main kahin-kahin hindi main marathi accent laate hai, jo gudgudaata bhi he
 Although he has worked very hard for this film, it has happened once or twice, where he has not engaged Peshwa and Ranveer Singh
 bajirao or mastaani main ishk hoga to iskaa khamiyaja kashibai ko bhugatna hi hoga
 'bajirao Mastani' is the same story of Priyanka Chopra
 priyanka ne apane kirdaar ko bakhubi nibhaayaa he, lekin puri film ranvir or deepika ko lekar hi he
 This is not the time for Priyanka to do a role in which she is not in focus
 film main tanvi azmi ne bajirao kii maa ke role main badhiya kaam kiya he
 Mahesh Manjrekar is also fine and Milind Soman is a general as an advisor to Bajirao
 kamai kii batsanjay lila bhansaali kii 'bajirao mastaani' ke liye muqabla box offis par aasaan nahin he, kyonki 'dilavaale' bhi iske saath relies hui he
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali has an audience of his own and then the film completely fits the criteria for fans of Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone
 kul milakar 'bajirao mastaani' ek intens lav story he
 The budget of the film is Rs 100 crore
 se zyada he
 But Sanjay Leela Bhansalijo weaves the world of Ishq is charismatic
 unka diarection kamaal kaa he
 The film has everything that makes it a one-time must watch film
 america or rus ke bich lagaataar talkhiyaan bad rahi hai
 Recently, the United States has imposed many restrictions on Russia, but despite this, India still maintains its friendship with Russia
 khabar he ki america ke pratibandhon ke baavjood bharat rus se jald hi S-400 air dephence missile system kii deal kar saktaa he
 Let me tell you that its price is about 30 thousand crores
 america ne rus ke upar countering american edwartise thru sanctions act 2017 (CAATSA) lagaaya hua he, jiske tahat america anya deshon ko rus ke saath dephence orintelligencebjnes karne se roktaa he
 This ban was imposed on 1 January this year
 mail today ko ek sutara ne bataaya ki bharat or america ke bich is mudde ko lekar baatcheet hui he
 But despite this, India is firm on its decision and is willing to buy the missile system from Russia
 aapako bataa den ki america ke is pratibandh ke kaaran turki, katar, saudi arab jaise desh rus se is missile system ko nahin kharid paa rahe hai
 However, despite this, India and China are buying this missile system from Russia
 is missile kii maarak kshamta 350 kimi
 Till then
 sutron kii maane to bharat or rus ke bich isko lekar baat shuru ho gai he
 It is being told that Russia is not confident of doing this deal with China
 kyonki aisa dekhne ko mila he ki china reversaijineeringkarata he yahi kaaran he ki rus aisa kar rahaa he
 Even if Russia gives this system to China, it will give less capacity
 bharat or rus ke bich abhi ye deal paison ko lekar fansi he
 Because the price that Russia is asking is close to 7 US billion dollars
 gauratlab he ki bharat ke paas agar ye missile system aata he, to bhartiya upmahadweep main bharat kii takat badhegi
 The way China is constantly besieging India, this system will prove to be very important for India
 is system ke jariye kareeb 250 mile tak ke hawaii hamale ko taala ja saktaa he, ye system ek saath 6 target ko khatm kar saktaa he
 Once again, a section of intellectuals and artists are seen coming up on the incidents of increasing mob lynching in the country

 report ke mutabik, "filmmekar maniratnam ke saathiyon ne is baat kii pushti kii he or kaha he ki yadi koi bhi report hastakshar ke nakli hone kaa daawa karti he to wo farji or aadharahin he
 "the report also claimed that Mani Ratnam's PRO said that he only talks to the media during the launch of a film
 bataa den ki pradhanmantri ko likhi chitthee main sahitya, cinema, itihaas or kala jagat kii 49 hastiyon ke hastakshar bhi hai
 These include names of giants like Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Ramchandra Guha, Anurag Kashyap
 ab maniratnam ke inkaar ke baad chitthee ko lekar vivaad ho saktaa he
 What is there in the letter written to PM Modi? All the celebrities have demanded PM Modi to enact strict laws to prevent incidents of mob lynching and severe punishment should be given to the accused
 ahasamati ko kuchlaa naa jaae
 It is written in the letter, our constitution describes India as a secular republic, where people of every religion, group, gender, caste have equal rights

 It is also written that just criticizing PM Modi for such incidents will not work

 The main accused Zubair was caught with the weapon, he is also injured

 ' karnataka ke mukhyamantri siddharmaiya kii chhavi aise rajaneta kii he jo andhvishwaason main bharosa nahin karte or unki disha duusare rajanetaaon kii tarah jyotishi tay nahin karte
 But on Tuesday in Mysore, when a farmer from Kollegal in Chamaraj Nagar district offered him a scarlet shawl, Siddaramaiah refused to take it and sat in his car
 haalanki yah kisaan kisaan laal rang kii shawl lekar kaaphi der tak koshish karata rahaa, lekin surakshakarmiyon ne use baahar kar diya
 Actually Kollegal is a place in Chamarajanagar which has been infamous for black magic for centuries
 tippaniyan Before Siddaramaiah, no Chief Minister came to this place
 had tab hui jab ek baar purv pradhanmantri echdi devegoda ko dhyaan nahin rahaa or ve chamrajanagar ke liye nikal pade
 Someone halfway reminded that Kollegal falls in the middle
 phir kya tha, unhone apni yatra vahiin roki
 Helicopter ordered, then reached Chamranagar
 haal hi main mukhyamantri siddharmaiya kii offisial car par ek kauwa baitha dikhaa to unki gaadi badal gai
 At that time, it arose in the media that this was done due to superstition
 baad main siddharmaiya ne safai di ki gaadi puraani thi or kauwe ke baithne se pehle hi nai gaadi kharidne kaa order pehle hi diya ja chukaa tha
 However, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has not yet responded to the latest case as to why he refused to take the red shawl from the Kollegal farmer
 siddharmaiya ko mukhyamantri ke taur par hataane kii maang karnataka congress ke andar tej ho rahi he
 Perhaps the Chief Minister may have thought that the time is not going well, in such a situation should be kept away from controversial things

 aadhe raste main kisi ne yaad dilaayaa ki bich main kollegal bhi padataa he
 What was it then, they stopped their journey there
 helicopter mangaya, tab jaakar chamranagar pahunche
 Recently, when a crow was seen sitting on the official car of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, his car changed
 us samay media main yah baat uchhali ki andhvishwaas kii vajah se aisa kiya gaya
 Later Siddaramaiah clarified that the car was old and an order to buy a new car had already been placed before the crow could sit
 haalanki mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ne taaja maamle main philhal pratikriya nahin di he ki unhone kollegal ke kisaan se laal shawl lene se inkaar kyon kiya
 The demand for the removal of Siddaramaiah as Chief Minister is intensifying within the Karnataka Congress
 shaayad mukhyamantri ne sochaa hoga ki samay sahi nahin chal rahaa, aise main vivadaspad chizon se dur hi rahaa jaye

 bhavari aakhir kahaan he
 No clue of this missing nurse from Rajasthan has been found so far
 jis mantri par is maamle main ungali uthaai ja rahi he, usne bhi kaha he ki meraa is masale se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 This is the story of a nurse from floor to hail
 peshey se nurse bhavari devi ko marijon kii timaardaari nahin, balki apni adaaon se modelling kii rangeen duniya main chaa jane kaa shauk tha or vahi shauk use rajasthan ke satta galiyaaron ke bade naamon ke bich le gaya
 But Bhanwari went missing since 1 September
 rajasthan kii hukumat se lekar siyasat tak is sawaalon ke bhavar main fansaa he ki bhavari he kahaan
 If he was kidnapped, who did it
 or ek sawaal ye bhi he kahin bhavari devi kaa katl to nahin ho gaya
 The statement of Bhanwari Devi's husband raises a finger on Rajasthan's Water Resources Minister Mahipal Maderna
 kareeb saat-aath saal pehle bhavari ko ek sarkari dispenceri main eenem yani nurse ke neeche vaala post mila tha
 But she was suspended on charges of negligence
 apni naukari bachaane ke chakkar main wo pehle malakhan singh vishnoi se mili or phir vishnoi ke jariye mahipal maderna se
 On Maderna's recommendation, Bhanwari was not only restored, but she came to the hospital near her house
 lekin kehete hai ki tab tak use oonche rasookh waalon ke bich uthne-baithne kaa chaska lag chukaa tha
 Then he was promoted in such a way that he did not have a car, a bungalow and a servant
 lekin kuch samay pehle ye afvaah faili ki bhavari ke paas maderna or vishnoi kii ek sidi he, jiske bal par wo unhen blackmel kar rahi he
 It is said that after this, both the leaders increased the distance from Bhanwari
 lekin kareeb dhai maheene ye khabar aane lagi ki teenon main ab samjhauta ho chukaa he
 After this, the phone conversation between the three started again
 aakhri dhai maheene ke kol detail is baat kii tasdik karte hai
 But the discussion of CD was still in full swing
 is bich agast main bhavari ne apni puraani swift car malakhan vishnoi ke bhattije sohanlal vishnoi ko saadhe chaar lakh rupee main bech di
 Fifty thousand rupees were received immediately, but it is said that for the remaining four lakh rupees, Sohan had called Bhanwari on September 1 and since then Bhanwari is missing
 is bich mantri mahipal maderna bhi gaayab ho gayi
 But on Thursday, he came forward and said that he has nothing to do with the Bhanwari case
