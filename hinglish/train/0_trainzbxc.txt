 bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Thursday addressed an election meeting in Jagdalpur in Bastar, Chhattisgarh
 unhone hameshaa kii tarah sthaneey boli main logon kaa swaagat kiya or pradesh sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan ginaayin
 He claimed that the dream of creating a developed Chhattisgarh was dreamed by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and it will be fulfilled only when Raman Singh's government returns
 pradesh kii sampada ke gungan or yuvaaon ke aahvaan ke alaava modi ke is bhaashan kii khaas baat thi daliton or adivaasiyon kaa baar-baar zikr
 Modi, who cast a shadow on the 'yaduvansh' community in Patna, appealed to the backward and tribals especially this time to vote for the BJP
 unhone daawa kiya ki khaadya suraksha hindustan main sabase pehle chhattisgarh ne di or iske baad hi upie ko isaki ahmiyat samaj ai
 Modi left no stone unturned to praise Chief Minister Raman Singh in his speech
 unhone yahaan tak kah daalaa ki aane vaale 5 saalon main raman singh chhattisgarh ko gujarat se bhi aage le jaaenge
 Assembly elections are to be held in Chhattisgarh on 11 and 19 November
 padhie modi kaa puraa bhaashanmai danteshwari ke koti koti pranamamen pehle bhi kai baar jagadalpur aayaa hum
 Have visited the interiors of Bastar
 main bijepi kaa sanghathan kaa kaam dekhtaa tha
 Then i got the privilege of doing extensive touring
 bastar jila puure kerala rajya se bhi bada he
 This Bastar has so much wealth
 lekin desh kaa durbhaagya ki congress ne apni hukumat ke samay is ilaake kii jaraa bhi parvaah nahin kii
 During that time he used to come here for picnic
 yaar-doston ko lekar jangalon main aate the
 Used to show our tribals
 garibi kii pradarshnee karte the
 The citizens of Chhattisgarh should not forget the gratitude of Atal Bihari Vajpayee throughout his life
 yah unheen kii duuradrushti thi ki alag rajya banane se yahaan ke logon ko avasar milenge to yahaan ke logon or mitti main aisa dam he ki vah baaki rajyon ke muqabla kar saktaa he
 Today, i felicitate Atal ji for constructing Chhattisgarh
 unke man main daliton, shoshiton or adivasee bhai bahanon ke prati vishesh lagaav tha
 He did not give slogans
 vah moti-moti baaten nahin karte the
 In order to strengthen the society, he used to plan with far-off thinking, take decisions and employ the government
 is desh main adivasee samaaj kab se he
 Is it not for thousands of years? Is tribal society poor and backward or not? The country became independent, Congress had so many governments
 lekin kisi bhi sarkaar ko adivaasiyon kii yaad nahin ai
 His children were not worried
 yah atal bihari vaajapeyi desh ko pehle pradhanmantri mili jinhone adivaasiyon ke kalyaan ke liye alag mantralay banaaya, alag sachiv niyukt kiye or bajet banaaya
 After this, the lives of tribals improved
 itnaa hi nahin, hamaare north east main sabase zyada adivasee rahete hai, uske liye unhone alag sankalan kii vyavastha kii
 And just as Atal ji gave us Chhattisgarh, so did the new system for the development of tribals
 bhaaiyon-bahanon jab chhattisgarh bana tab main yahaan kaam karata tha, gujarat main mukhyamantri nahin tha
 Then it went to the state Congress and my brothers and sisters, when i remember those three years, the memory of the Chief Minister's vigor and the acts of oppression at that point of time, the hunger stood up
 aisa mukhyamantri tha ki pradarshan kar rahe hamaare kaaryakartaaon par aisa atyaachaar kiya ki chah-chah maheene tak kaaryakarta jail main rahe
 This kind of persecution did not happen in the country
 tab laga ki kahin atal ji kaa chhattisgarh ko viksit banane kaa sapana adhuraa to nahin rah jayega
 But brothers and sisters, i salute the Dalits, tribals of Chhattisgarh
 ve halaat samaj gaye or pehle hi chunaav main us julmi shashal ko aise ukhaad kar phenk diya ki hindustan main congress ke bure din kii ginati shuru ho gai
 Imagine, brothers and sisters, what would have happened to your Chhattisgarh today if you had not given ten years to Dr
 Raman Singh and BJP
 luteron ke haal main pradesh chalaa gaya hota to kuch nahin bachataa
 Congress's Delhi government fell behind coal, behind coal, not even one kilo of coal left in your Chhattisgarh, looted it
 ye haal karke rakhaa he inhone bhaaiyon-bahanon
 If Congress had a claw here, Chhattisgarh would have been destroyed
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ne koi khun kharabe ke bina, prem se teen rajya banaae the, jharkhand, uttarakhand, chhattisgarh
 Any person should record the history of these three states
 aap dekh len jharkhand or uttarakhand pichhadta chalaa gaya
 a lonely Chhattisgarh overtook
 kaaran kya he
 The reason is your vision and understanding
 uttarakhand main raajnneetik asthirataa rahi isliye pragati nahin rahi
 What a huge accident happened in Kedarnath
 lekin sarkaar ko parvaah nahin
 See Jharkhand, the richest state of India
 lekin itani badi kudarti sampatti hone ke baad bhi dinon-din girtaa chalaa gaya
 Chhattisgarh survived because you trusted Raman Singh and the Bharatiya Janata Party and carried forward the journey of development
 main gujarat kii dharti se prarthana karne aayaa hum ki hindustan ke logon ne dal, jati, sampradaay, birdari yaa rishtedaari ke liye vot die honge, lekin ab vakt badal chukaa he
 If you want to vote now, then you have to vote for development
 vikaas ke liye vot dena he
 Today such a government should be good for you and your children and only BJP and Dr
 Raman Singh can give such a government
 main aagrah karne aayaa hum ki chhattisgarh kii vikaas yatra main ab koi or rukaawat nahin aani chahie
 In our house too, when children are 13 years old, they start growing rapidly
 har 6 maheene main kapade chote ho jate hai
 Height and weight start increasing
 chhattisgarh kaa bhi aisa mahatvapurn samay he
 Chhattisgarh has also entered the age of 13 to 18
 is samay agar sahi laalan-paalan kiya gaya to yah pradesh kitna aage badhegaa iskaa andaja aap laga sakate hai
 These five years are very important
 doctor raman singh ne majboot neenv rakh di he
 2013 to 2018 is the most important period to take Chhattisgarh to new heights
 is samay chhattisgarh shashakt ho gaya to vikaas yatra rukegi nahin
 i have come to say for the siblings of Chhattisgarh that this election is an election that will lay the foundation for the coming 100 years
 vot vikaas ke liye hona chahie
 Vote bank politics should be buried
 main dekh rahaa hum
 Has anyone ever seen such a huge gathering in Jagdalpur? ye aandhi he aandhi
 This wind has changed
 desh vikaas chahta he
 The government wants to work for the poor
 ye congress party, naare detii he
 Congress's hand, poor's support
 kya hua bhai
 They used to show you hands first, when power came, they started trying hands and when Mastery came, they were not doing anything other than cleaning hands
 bhaaiyon-bahanon, yah panja koyale ko bhi nahin chodta he
 Nowadays people are thinking of keeping coal and onion in the locker
 bhaaiyon-bahanon hindustan kaa garib jo jowar, bajra, makke kii roti ke saath pyaaj khaakar guzaara karata tha, usase pyaaj ko bhi chin liya gaya he
 Such a sultanate needs to be taken away from the whole of India
 ek sawaal puuchhuun, jawaab doge
 Do you trust this Congress? (voice of 'no' from Public) He promised to reduce inflation in 100 days
 inhone vaadakhilaphi kii
 The brothers and sisters of Chhattisgarh will not accept a single thing from the Congress, i am sure
 kya raman singh sarkaar na hoti to kya kabhi bastar uniwarsity ban sakati thi kya? aaj doctor nahin mil rahe logon ko? kyonki congress kii sarkaar medical college kholane ko taiyaar nahin
 Colleges do not blossom without a bag of money
 rupayon ke dher lage bina admician nahin miltaa
 i congratulate Raman Singh that he has pledged to help the poor by opening a medical college here
 raman singh kam log samajhate hai
 But if we say 'rice wale baba' then people say yes our Chief Minister
 dilli ke shahjade aapaki ankhon main dhul jhonk rahe hai ki khaadya suraksha kanoon laae
 Brothers and sisters of Chhattisgarh, you are a proof that Chhattisgarh government has given the first food security in India
 upie ko yah baat chhattisgarh ko hi dekhakar samaj ai
 Government should be for development but also sensitive
 maowad, banduukon kaa shor, chaaron ore khun kii holiyaan, iske baavjood jab majboot dil kaa netaa hota he to sankat ke bich bhi vikaas kii naiya ko aage badhaata he
 This has been shown by Raman Singh

 Listen to political pundits carefully

 Raman Singh appeared in front of the media and said that if we are missing, we will go into his depth
 unhone aadesh die or usee pal apni yatra sthagit kar di
 Not only this, Raman Singh himself went to the house of the slain Congress leaders and joined the grief of his family members
 jinhone us din raman singh kaa cheharaa dekha hoga ve kitni pidaa anubhav kar rahe the
 Two days later, at the National Security Council meeting, everyone praised his patience
 duusari taraf patna main itane bade cond ke baad vahaan kii sarkaar mehfil manaa rahi he
 Fifty-six indulgences are being served

 The connectivity will also improve the power sector of the state
 swasthya sevaaon kii sehat behatar hogi or arunachal kii samskruti ko bhi badhaava milegaa: piem modiasu sadasyon ke ek anya samooh ne kuch minute ke baad teji se ja rahe modi ke kafile ko kaale jhande dikhaaye

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Uttar Pradesh's Dumariyaganj seat, Jagadambikapal is once again trying to change political lines
 aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main camel kaa saath chhodkar vah cycle kii sawari karte najar aa sakate hai
 In fact, the sword is hanging on the claim of many sitting mps from Uttar Pradesh to the BJP in 2019
 bijepi alaakaman dobaaraa se kai saansadon ko maidan main utaarne ko lekar taiyaar nahin he
 It is believed that BJP has two dozen Lok Sabha members whose tickets can be cut
 aise membijapi ke ye saansad nae raajnneetikthikaane kii talash main jute gaye hai
 Jagdambika Pal, who quit the Congress in 2014 and joined BJP, gave the BJP a ticket again and it cannot be said with certainty
 is bich jagdambika paal kii ek aisi tasviir saamne ai he, jisamen vahasapaake rashtriya adhyakikhileshyadav ke saath baithe najar aa rahe hai
 Another person is also present in the picture with both the leaders
 band kamare kii yah mulaakaat raajnneetik thi yaa phir vyaktigat, is par to abhi saarvajanik taur par koi jaankaree saamne nahin ai he
 But this meeting amidst the election preparations is giving rise to many speculations
 ek or maukey par aise hi tasviir dekhne ko mili thi, jab purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke nidhan ke baad shradhanjali dene panhuche mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh yadav ke kareeb jagdambika paal najar aae the
 But being a public place, this picture was not seen through political glasses
 haalanki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle donon netaaon ke bich hui mulaakaat kii tasviir saamne aane ke baad se siyaasi myne talash kiye jane lage hai
 His closeness to SP mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav is already known
 bataa den kijagdambika palka rajanithik safar hameshaa se bada utaar-chadhaav bharaa rahaa he
 The number of Muslim and Yadav voters in Dumriaganj parliamentary constituency is quite high
 vahiin, soobe main banate raajnneetik sameekaran main jagdambika paal ko ek baar jeet kii ummid najar aa rahi he
 Perhaps this is the reason why Jagdambika Pal is seen leaning towards SP
 jagdambika paal ne apana siyaasi safar congress se shuru kiya tha
 After this, together with Naresh Aggarwal and Rajiv Shukla, he broke the Congress party and formed the All India Democratic Congress and supported Kalyan Singh's government
 paal upi ke aise netaa hai jo ek din ke liye mukhyamantri bhi bane the
 However, he again returned to the Congress
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke tikat se dumriyaganj seat se saansad chune gaye the
 He joined BJP before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 ab nae thikaane kii talash main hai

 darbhanga maamle main hi bijepi netaaon kii alag-alag bayaanbaji saamne aa chuki he
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said that the killing took place due to the ground dispute, but after this Union Minister Giriraj Singh and BJP President Nityanand Rai said that the murder took place because of naming the Chowk after Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 mangalvaar ko patna main nitish kumaar bijepi netaaon ke in ravaiye se khafa dikhe
 He said that the incident happened in Darbhanga district right now and was murdered due to a land dispute
 is dauraan usee main se kisi ne kah diya ki modi ke naam se chowk banane kii vajah se hatya kii gai
 Nitish said that when we asked the DGP in the matter, he said that there was murder in the land quarrel
 ab uske baad susheel modi ne twit kiya ki hamako jaankaree unhone or police ke logon ne di
 The CM appealed to the media that the statement of a common man should not be prominently published without investigating any matter
 nitish kumaarane kaha ki media kii bhi kuch jimmedaariyaan hai
 He said that usually Sushil Modi's statement printed only two-three columns, but the tweet of that day was dealt in two lines and it was reported that the murder was caused by Modi Chowk
 unhone kaha ki is tarah kii baat log kyon karte hai, taaki jhagada ho
 Earlier the fever used to be viral and now the message is going viral
 log kya-kya likhakar samaaj main tanaav failaana chaahate hai
 Nitish Kumar said that we cannot compromise on things like corruption
 yahi vajah he ki hamane apana alag rasta chunaa he

 The Muslim Women Marriage Rights Protection Bill, 2018, brought with the aim of stopping the practice of triple talaq (divorce-e-biddat), passed in the Lok Sabha on Thursday
 5 ghante chali charchaa ke baad vidheyak ke paksh main 245 or virodh main 11 vot pade, jabaki voting ke dauraan congress, ediemke, diemke or samaajawaadee party ne walk out kar diya
 With the central government having a clear majority in the lower house of Parliament, it was believed that the bill would be passed in the Lok Sabha
 lekin vipakshi dalon samet ahm muddon par centre kaa saath dene vaali ediemke kaa walk out karnaa yah sanket de gaya ki yah vidheyak rajyasabha main ek baar phir atak saktaa he
 In August 2017, the Supreme Court called the government to enact a law, declaring the practice of divorce-e-biddat unconstitutional
 sarkaar ne disambar, 2017 main loksabhaa main muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak loksabhaa se paarit karaayaa, lekin yah bill rajyasabha main atak gaya kyonki ucch sadan sarkaar ke paas paryaapt sankhya bal nahin he
 The opposition demanded that there should also be a provision for bail in the triple talaq
 lihaaja, agast main vidheyak main sanshodhan kiye gaye, lekin ek baar phir yah vidheyak rajyasabha main atak gaya
 After this, the government brought the ordinance in September
 chunki, adhyadesh kii avadhi 6 maheene hoti he lihaaja yah bill ek baar phir sanshodhan ke saath loksabhaa main laayaa gaaya
 Now the biggest test in front of the government is in the Rajya Sabha because in the upper house, the government still does not have the strength to pass the bill
 pichhali baar jab yah bill rajyasabha main aayaa tha to ise kuch sanshodhan ke saath select cameti ke paas bhej diya gaya tha
 Although the bill was supported by the Congress, it demanded that some important amendments be made to the bill
 ab jab teen talaak vidheyak dobaaraa loksabhaa main aayaa to congress is vidheyak ko asanvaidhanik bataate hue walk out kar gai
 Walkout of Congress is not as big an issue for the government as it is for AIADMK walkout
 kyonki aksar yah dekha gaya he kathin paristhitiyon ediemke ne sarkaar kaa saath diya he
 What does the Rajya Sabha say? The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) currently has 86 mps in the Rajya Sabha, including 73 from BJP, 6 from JDU, 3 from Shiv Sena, 3 from Akali Dal and 1 from RPI
 vahiin vipaksh kii baat karen to congress ke 50, samaajawaadee party ke 13, tiemasi ke 13, sipiem ke 5, ensipi ke 4, ensipi ke 4, bispi ke 4, sipiai ke 2 or pidipi ke 2 saansad shaamil hai
 This opposition has 97 mps
 jabaki rajyasabha main wo dal jo kisi kheme main nahin he or halaat dekhakar apana rukh tay karte hai unamem tiares ke 6, bijedy ke 9 or ediemke ke 13 saansad hai
 Now after a walkout from the Lok Sabha, the question arose before the government that what will be the stand of AIADMK in the Upper House
 loksabhaa se walkout karne vaale saansadon kii maang thi ki bill par vistrut charchaa ke liye donon sadanon kii sanyukt select cameti ke paas bheja jaae
 The question of these parties is why should triple talaq be considered a crime? Also, why the family of the person who is to be punished for this crime was not taken care of
 teen talaak bill pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye ek ahm vidheyak he jise ve tamaam reliyon centre sarkaar kii uplabdhi or nari shashaktikaran kii disha main bahut bada kadam bataate rahe hai
 In such a situation, in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the BJP would like to take this achievement and go among the people
 ab pehali samasya yah he ki maujuuda sansad satr 8 janvari tak hi chalanaa he or agar is baar bhi bill rajyasabha main atak jaataa he to sarkaar ko dobaaraa adhyadesh laana padegaa
 Since this is the last session, this bill can be brought again before the new government and the new parliament
 ham kahaan ja rahe hai, yah jaanane se pehle ham kahaan aa pahunche hai, zaraa ruk kar dekh lenaa chahie
 In the case of rape in Kathua, Jammu, our society has removed its own map
 ham betiyon kii parvaah karte hai yah dhong bhi apane aap saamne aa gaya he
 If you hear about the rape of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua, then you will be convinced that you are living the life of a dead time
 yahi nahin balaatkaar ke maamle main police jab aarope patr daayar karne pahunchi to thane ko jis tarah gheraa gaya or jai shri ram ke naare lage, yah sun lenge to aap kabhi ram se nazar nahin mila paaenge
 Incidentally, the MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, accused of rape in Unnao, UP, also said that the charge was also leveled against Prabhu Shri Ram
 jo log jai shri ram ke naare lagaate hai, mandiron main nahin, reliyon main vahi bataa sakate hai ki ab jai shri ram ke naare or kahaan kahaan lagane baaqi hai
 Sadly, even the so-called religious leaders who have gathered in the name of Rama have not objected to this
 kisi ko kyon lagata he ki jai shri ram kaa naam lene se yaa naare laga dene se vah kanoon se upar ho jayega
 If Jai Shri Ram is being used to destroy the system of law, then where is the Ram state in which the dream of justice is shown with all
 kai maheenon se kah rahaa hum ki aapke bharat main har jagah ek bheed stand bai par khadi he

 wo mar gai lekin zindaa rahane kii koi sambhaavna na bache isliye uske sar ko pathar par do baar maaraa gaya taaki wo mar jaae
 She died suna aapane ki wo mar gai
 You heard it properly, not that she died
 aapkaa sunanaa bahut zaruri he ki behoshee kii dawa dene, balaatkaar karne ke baad galaa ghont dene or pathar par sar de maarane ke baad mar gai
 a policeman then says stop now, he wants to rape her one more time

 aath saal kii us bacchee ke saath koi naagarik khadaa he yaa nahin aap bataa sakate hai
 When the police went to file the charge sheet, why was it justified to stop encircling it? kya yah zaruri tha ki jammu police jab chaalaan file karne pahunchi to bahut se log use rokane ke liye aa gaye

 lekin aaj ye log jangalon par bhi apane paaramparik adhikaron ke liye lard rahe hai
 And what is the condition of their rights in society, you must have understood from this heartbreaking story of Kathua
 ab ho sake to apane samaaj ke bare main sochie
 Think about yourself har taraf bheed he, har taraf hinsa he
 Yesterday a picture came from Bengal

 Be afraid of the crowd you see
 aapke desh main kahin koi system nahin he jo aisi bheed par lagaam laga le
 There is helplessness everywhere, and the crowd is dominating
 tippaniyan The Hindu Ekta Manch in Kathua is in favor of the accused, while the entire BJP and Yogi government in UP seems to be in defense of MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar
 unnav kii ladki bijepi vidhayak kuldeep senger par hatya ke aarope laga rahi he, aap unke hansate hue bayaan dekhie
 The girl's father was beaten to death, the allegation was leveled against the brother of the MLA
 ab to supreme court or hycourt ne sangyaan liya
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also sent a SIT to this girl's village after the commotion
 lekin esaiti se pehle hi vidhayak ke saikadon samarthak vahaan pahunch gaye, hangaamaa karne lage or vidhayak ko nirdosh bataane lage
 But someone's conscience is awake
 upi main bijepi kii media cell kii sadsy dipti bharadwaj ne twit kiya he ki 'aadarneey bhai amit shah ji, uttar pradesh ko bachaa lijie, sarkaar ke nirnay sharmasaar kar rahe hai
 These stains will not be washed away
 aadarneey bhai narendra modiji or aapke saath ham sabake sapane chur-chur honge
 ' bijepi apane vidhayak ke prati sahanubhuti rakhti he
 She does not want arrests based on media trials or charges
 kya yahi paimaana bijepi khud apanaati he
 In Jammu, where the investigation is being done, the charge sheet is being done, then its ministers are defending the accused
 ladki ke pita ko police kii hiraasat main maaraa gaya he
 Keep looking at where the scales of justice tilt
 dharm dekhakar jhukta he yaa jati dekhakar jhukta he
 We also believe that nothing should happen under the pressure of the mob but one father died in police custody, the brother's name is not even added in the FIR
 kiske dabaav main pita kii giraptari hui, uski hatya hui

 desh ke sabhi computaron par najar rakhane ke liye narendra modi sarkaar ne ek bada faisla liya he
 The Union Union Ministry of Home Affairs on Friday has allowed 10 central agencies to spy on any computer running in the country by breaching it
 modi sarkaar ke is faisle par asaduddin ovaisi ne shakht etraj jataate hue tanj ksaa or kaha ki ab samaj main aayaa ki ghar-ghar modi kaa matlab kya he? aap saansad sanjay singh ne kaha ki loktantr khatm karke modishahi ghoshit karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 However, when questioned by the opposition on Home Ministry notifications, Union Law and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad objected strongly and said that this notification is within the scope of the Constitution and the law
 yah tab tak lagu nahin hoga jab tak vyaktigat cese main grih sachiv is par apni sahmati nahin de dete
 He said that the Congress is questioning us who imposed Emergency
 nira radia tepe unke jamaane main hua
 Ravi Shankar Prasad says that opposition was opposed by the opposition, especially the Congress, without knowing the truth
 desh kii suraksha par sawaal khadaa kiya gaya
 The security of our country is of paramount importance
 iske koi samjhauta nahin ho saktaa
 'now understood the meaning of house to house Modi' Earlier, Asaduddin Owaisi tweeted that he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he has issued orders to 10 central agencies to monitor your computer
 ovaisi ne aage likhaa ki ab samaj main aayaa ki ghar-ghar modi kaa matlab aapke computer main jhaankna he

 After losing the election, the Modi government has now come down to scan and spy on your computer
 abaki baar,niztaa par waar! congress netaa ne kaha ki 'big brother syndrome' vastav main endie ke diene main samahit he
 Spying of the public is a condemnable tendency of the Modi government
 har bhartiya apradhi!vahiin, sipiai (em) mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne har bhartiya ko apradhi kii tarah kyon dekha ja rahaa he? sarkaar ne desh ke har computer par kendriya agenciyon ke dwaara najar rakhane kaa jo aadesh he vah puri tarah se asanvaidhanik he
 This is a decision that violates telephone tapping guidelines and privacy
 bataa den ki kendriya grih mantralay ke aadesh ke mutabik desh kii ye 10 suraksha agenciyaan kisi bhi vyakti ke computer main kisi bhi samay jenerate, transmit, risive or store kiye gaye kisi soochna yaa dastavej ko dekh sakati hai
 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Sanjay Singh, criticizing the government's decision to 'modi Shahi instead of democracy', said, 'this government wants to enter the bedroom of every human being
 yah notification bahut hi aloktantric or taanaashaahee purna he
 i believe that in the past, after the student leaders' tapped phones in Uttar Pradesh, there has been a ruckus on this method, to reduce the matter, a notification has been issued by the Central Government
 ' unhone aage kaha ki is desh ke andar taanaashaahee ghoshit kar do
 Tap anyone's phone
 kisi ke bhi ghar main ghus jaao, kisi ko bhi chauraahey main pakadakar maar do, yahi to kar rahi he yah sarkaar
 Sanjay Singh said that the case, which is considered by the Supreme Court as a matter of privacy, cannot tap someone's phone without permission, a process has to go through
 aap kisi kaa bhi phone tepe karne kii puri aazaadee de rahe hai
 In this country, democracies are declaring Modi Shahi
 har sawaal kaa jawaab nahinhaalankigrih mantralay ke nae notificationako lekar kendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki jo bhi sanvaidhanik or takneekee rup se sahi hota he, usee kaa faisla mantralay or sarkaar karti he
 It is the habit of the opposition to raise questions and every question of theirs cannot be answered
 maryaada main rahen jaanch agenciyangrih mantralay ke nae aadesh par saansad rakesh sinha ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki soshal media or internet kaa lagaataar durupyog ho rahaa he
 As and when terrorist incidents increase, investigations of this method increase
 jab ek karod thik kar rahe hon or ek vyakti galat kar rahaa ho to vahi desh ke liye ghaatak ban jaataa he
 i would say that the investigating agencies should investigate with dignity
 kisi kii privesi kaa ulanghan na ho, is baat kaa jarur dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie
 i think that the Ministry of Home Affairs will take care of it which maintains the privacy of the person
 duusari ore, rajyasabha saansad keties tulsi ne kaha ki yah sab snooping ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se kiya ja rahaa he
 India has a constitution and no one can interfere in the freedom it has been given
 sansad bhi dakhal nahin de sakati to grih mantralay kis tareeke se dakhal de saktaa he
 It seems that the Modi government is trying to establish dictatorship, we will raise our voice against it

 But in this court, devotees have darshan of the mother from a small window

 It is believed that Mother Bagulamukhi is the Pitambara Devi, so yellow things are offered to her
 lekin maa ko prasann karnaa itnaa aasaan bhi nahin he
 For this, special rituals have to be done, in which the devotee has to wear yellow clothes, yellow things are offered to the mother and then they are asked to ask
 manyata he ki vidhi vidhaan se agar anushthathan kar liya jaae to maa jald hi bhakton kii manokamanaayen puri kar detii hai
 Mother Pitambara is considered to be the goddess of royalty and devotees worship her in this form

 Mother Pitambara is the presiding goddess of enemy destruction and the worship of mother has special significance in attaining the kingdom

 On the right side of the temple sits Khandeshwar Mahadev, who is worshiped in a tantric form
 mahadevake darbar se baahar nikalate hi das mahavidhyaon main se ek maa dhoomavati ke darshan hote hai
 The most unique thing is that devotees get the privilege of seeing Maa Dhumavati only during the aarti because the doors of the temple remain closed for the rest of the time

 In fact, Rahul Gandhi accused the Defense Minister of misleading the country by not revealing the prices of Rafale planes under the pressure of the Prime Minister and said that PM Chowkidar is not a partner
 kangras adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne france ke saath hui rafel deal kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki modi sarkaar ne upie kii deal ko radd kar france se rafel vimaanon ko lekar jo deal kii uski vajah se rafel kaa daam 1600 karod ho gaya
 Rahul pointed to the Defense Minister, saying that he had earlier said that the price fixed in the Rafale aircraft deal will be conveyed to the country
 lekin baad me unhone france ke saath is saude ko lekar gopniyata kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki vah daam nahin bataa sakati
 Rahul Gandhi accused the Defense Minister of lying and said that i myself met the President of France when he came to Delhi
 is mulaakaat ke dauraan unhone france ke raashtrapati se poocha ki kya is tarah kii koi deal hui he jisame rafel ke vimaano ke daam gupt rakhane kii baat he, tab france ke raashtrapati ne unase kaha ki aisi koi deal nahin he
 You can tell the whole country about Rafale prices
 rahul gandhi ne raksha mantri par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke dabaav me jhooth bolne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki ek udyogpati jo pradhanmantri ke mitra hai ko phayda pahunchane ke liye upie ke dauraan hui rafel deal ko badla gaya
 The Saudis from Hindustan Aeronautical Limited were snatched away and given to an industrialist who had a debt of Rs 36000 crore and had no experience in making aircraft

 Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the deal to keep the price secret in Rafale aircraft deals was done during the then UPA government
 jiskaa unki sarkaar paalan kar rahi he
 Nirmala Sitharaman, citing Rahul Gandhi's meeting with the President of France, said that in some media reports, on behalf of the President of France, it was said that if the price was given, the competing companies could benefit
 rahul gandhi ne pradhanmantri par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki unke dabaav me rafel deal ko badla gaya
 The Prime Minister should tell the country about this defense deal
 piem par tanj kasate hue rahul ne kaha ki piem muskaraa rahe hai lekin vah mujhase najar nahin mila sakate or ye sachai he jo puraa desh dekh rahaa he
 Rahul said that the Prime Minister calls himself a janitor, but i say PM is not a janitor, he is a partner
 agle maheene hone vaale raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar desh kii raajnneetik sargharmiyaan bad gai he
 In view of this, Venkaiah Naidu, a member of the committee formed by the Bharatiya Janata Party, and Rajnath Singh met Congress President Sonia Gandhi at his residence on Friday
 aapako bataa den ki centre sarkaar chaahati he ki nae raashtrapati kaa chunaav aam sahmati se ho or congress adhyaksh se mulaakaat inhen koshishon ke tahat thi
 However, this meeting could not last even 30 minutes
 vahiin is baithak ke baad samvaadadaataaon ko jaankaree dete hue varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha, bijepi netaaon ne koi naam hi saamne nahin rakhaa, balki hamase hi poochhate rahen
 Azad said, they had come to support us, but the question is, if you do not know the name (of the presidential candidate) then what should be the agreement
 agar aap naam nahin jaanate, to phir kaise bataaenge ki sahyog denge yaa nahin
 After this, BJP leaders Venkaiah Naidu and Rajnath Singh also met CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury
 vahiin yechuri ne india today se baatcheet main raashtrapati pad kii ummdwari ke liye laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi ke naam par rajamandi se inkaar kar kiya diya he
 Yechury said, 'I know BJP leaders are coming and they are welcome
 lekin ab isamen der ho gai, aakhir unhen aam sahmati chahie thi, to phir itnaa intjaar kyon kiya? ham kisi aise ko raashtrapati bananaa chaahate hai, jisaki dharmanirpeksh chhavi sawaalon main na ho
 And the court has questioned Advani, Joshi's image, not only us
 congress netaaon se milin soniarashtrapati pad ke liye ummidavaar ko lekar congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne guuruuvaar ko party ke varisht netaaon se mulaakaat kii thi
 Leaders meeting with Sonia included Mallikarjun Kharge, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ahmed Patel
 kya jawaab dengi sonia?sutron ke mutabik, baithak main tay hua ki jab endie ke netaa aaenge to sonia gandhi kya pratikriya dengi
 The Congress hopes that NDA leaders can come up with a two-pronged strategy
 pehla ye ki, wo kuch naam suza sakate hai or sonia kii raay maang sakate hai or doosraa, wo kah sakate hai ki janamat hamaare saath he, isliye ham jo bhi ummidavaar tay karen vipaksh ko uskaa samarthan karnaa chahie
 On this meeting, Congress leader Anand Sharma said that on the basis of what NDA leaders talk about, Sonia will answer
 mulaakaat se pehle kya kaha ja saktaa he?anya partiyon ko bhi saath laane kii koshishaiske pehle bijepi kii team ne bispi saansad satish chandra mishra, ensipi netaa prafull patel, or seetaram yechuri se phone par baat kiya he
 a decision on any name could not be made in the meeting of the opposition sub-committee on the presidential candidate on Wednesday
 sutron ke mutabik, sonia ne tay kiya he ki vah koi sidhaa jawaab endie ke netaaon ko nahin dengi, balki ve kahengi ki vipaksh kii 17 partiyon se baat karke hi koi faisla karengi
 Sonia Gandhi believes that the Congress is already discussing this issue with 17 opposition parties, so only after talking to them, they will decide and the decision will be collective of the opposition
 20 yaa 21 june ko phir ho sakati he vipaksh kii baithksutron kaa ye bhi maananaa he ki endie ke netaaon se mulaakaat karne ke baad sonia 20 yaa 21 june ko ek baar 17 vipakshi partiyon kii baithak bulaaengi, jisamen sonia samet sabhi netaa apni apni raay rakhenge, kyonki endie ke netaa sonia ke alaava or bhi vipakshi netaaon se is bich mulaakaat kar lenge
 In fact, the Congress and all the opposition parties feel that the government is seen to be just a formality to talk to the opposition
 vah apni vichaardhaara kaa hi ummidavaar thopanaa chaahati he, jis par shaayad hi vipaksh kii sahmati mili
 So, without knowing the name, the opposition of the NDA candidate stayed backing
 isliye endie ke ummidavaar ke saamne aate hi vipaksh bhi apana ummidavaar tay kar degaa
 What does history say? However, history shows that during the Vajpayee government, Kalam Saheb's name was tossed by the Samajwadi Party, on which Congress and BJP came together, although the number game was not in favor of BJP then
 lekin baad main jab upie kii sarkaar bani to usne apana hi raashtrapati banaaya or bijepi ke ummidavaar se uskaa muqabla hua or nambar ke aadhaar par raashtrapati upie kaa ummidavaar bana, phir chaahe wo pratibha patil, bhairon singh shekhavat ko haraakar bani hon yaa pranab mukherjee, pi e sangama ko haraakar bane
 Overall, the situation is exactly the opposite today
 upie vipaksh main he, nambar endie ke paas he
 The NDA is ready to field its candidate and the opposition is in spite of the possibility of defeat
 yani ek baar phir raashtrapati chunaav main satta paksh or vipaksh takaraane kii taraf bad rahe hai

 Rabri Devi, Tejashwi Yadav, Misa Bharti and other senior leaders of the party attended this meeting but Tejapratap kept himself away from this meeting despite being present at home
 baithak main shaamil nahin hone ko lekar safai dete hue tejpratap ne kaha ki vah us din kaaphi biimaar the or is vajah semiting main shaamil nahinho paae the
 There was also increased speculation that Tejapratap is now being isolated from the RJD

 Tejapratap said that BJP and RSS, along with some leaders of his party, are also trying to get into a quarrel between the two brothers but this is not going to happen
 tejpratap ne kaha ki party ke andar tejasvi ke saath unka koi satta sangharsh nahin chal rahaa he or vah is koshish main lage hue hai ki 2020 main unka chota bhai bihar kaa mukhyamantri bane
 Tej said that the two brothers are working together in the party and will continue to do so
 gauratlab he ki pichley kuch maheenon main lalu parivaar main donon bhaaiyon ke bich jhagade kii khabaren baar-baar aati rahi hai
 In July, Tej Pratap Yadav posted a Facebook and said that Rabri Devi ignores her complaints
 haalanki, vivaad hone ke baad tejpratap ne kaha ki unka fasebuk acount bhaajapa dwaara hack kar liya gaya tha
 Tejapratap also said against the party's state president Ramchandra Poorve that he does not listen to them
 party ke sthapana diwas kaarykram ke dauraan bhi bolte hue tejpratap ne kaha tha ki vah apni party main sabhi varisht netaaon ke master hai

 In such a case, Dhoni is considered the biggest weapon of Virat in case of taking DRS

 Chahal then talked to Dhoni and Kohli

 Babar was batting at a personal score of 34 at the time

 Had Kohli not listened to Dhoni on the fifth ball of the 19th over and taken the DRS, there would not have been a 104-run partnership between Babar Azam and Fakhar Zaman

 We will give practice permission, as the matter of fact is that Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium, which comes under the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA), which GDCA has leased partially to the BCCI member Kerala Cricket Association for organizing Test matches for a period of 30 years But has given yun to bisisiai dwaara pratibandhit srisanth us stadium par practice nahin kar sakate lekin jisidie ke adhyaksh en venugopal kaa kahana he ki bhale hi srisanth ne ab tak stadium main net par abhyaas karne ke liye sanstha se sampark nahin kiya he lekin yadi vah aisa karata he to phir unka jawaab nishchit taur par haa hoga

 He said that if the KCA first informs that it will host a Test match at the stadium, the GCDA will hand over the entire stadium under their control until the tournament ends
 venugopal ne kaha, 'ham stadium ke maalik hai
 It is our right to decide who should be allowed to play in the field
 'kerala se sautela vyavhaar karata he bisisiiapako bataa den ki srisanth ne ravivaar ko adappali main sarkari skool ke maidan par net practice kii thi

 bisisiai par kerala ke prati sautela vyavhaar apnaane kaa aarope lagaate hue venugopal ne kaha ki kochi stadium jise ki mahaan cricketer sachin tendulkar ne sarvshereshth cricket stadium bataaya tha

 is
 unhone kochi stadium ko nahin chunaa jise ki mahaan cricketer sachin tendulkar ne sarvshereshth cricket maidan qaraar diya tha

 You must be thinking that Patna will become serious after this devastation, then you read Phanishwar Nath Renu
 baadh par usase acchhee reporting aapako nahin milegi
 Report of the flood of 1975 is published under the name Debt Water Dhanjal
 usamen jo patna dikh rahaa he wo aaj bhi vaisaa hi he
 By destroying all the concepts of time, the people of Patna are looking towards water, not towards the helpless government, beyond their chaos
 pani kitna kam hua, pani kitna aa gaya
 The difference is that people used to watch selfies now
 isi ko samajhane ke liye renu ke darj kiye gaye hisse ko padhanaa chahta hum
 But the pictures will be of today
 taaki aapako sunai de 1975 kaa patna or dikhaai de aaj kaa patna
 Renu writes, "on motor, scooter, tractor, motorcycle, truck, gig cycle, rickshaw and pedestrians are going to see water, people are returning after seeing water

 Those who were given the responsibility to see Patna also could not do more than see water

 The Patna that you are seeing flooded in Hindi there, it was built by architect Joseph F
 Mannings, who studied in Australia
 bihar odisha ke pehle leftinent governor charles stuart beli ne dhaka main kaam kar rahe manings ko bulaayaa tha
 At the same time there was a discussion about the new capital of Lutyens in Delhi, but another capital in India was ready to be built by Manning which was completed between 1912 and 1916
 e aakaar kaa sachivalay bana
 The Raj Bhavan and Patna Post Office are also the imagination of Mannings

 Except for the Patna High Court, all the buildings were built by Mannings
 patna hoicourt ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki newzealand ke sarkari imaaraton kii tarah he
 Much research has been done in New Zealand about Manning's Patna
 kyonki manings kii paidaaish newzealand kii thi
 Mannings regretted that he should not have settled Patna in the river plain
 manings ne kaha tha ki us ilaake main log naavon main savaar ghumaa karte the
 City was not to be settled there
 son nadi ke chode hue maidan par patna ko basaaya tha
 In 1925, Mannings had said that the drainage plan he had planned for Patna was not implemented
 ye sari jaankaree hetukar jha, vishwamohan jha or vishaal sharan naam ke itihaaskaar or shodharthiyon se mujhe mili thi
 In less time and less expenses, Mannings created a new city that was compared to Delhi
 manings ke patna banane ke baad hi purana patna patna city kaha jane laga
 The Gol Market built by this Mannings was demolished for Smart City
 patna ke kawarej main rajend nagar zyada he, kankarbagh zyada he kyonki vahaan patna ke bache hue elit rahete hai
 Elite patna ke garib ilaakon kaa kya haal he yah pataa nahin chal paa rahaa he

 During the press conference, Pelosi was asked whether the opposition Democrat was moving forward on the impeachment motion due to his personal disapproval of the 73-year-old US president
 pelocy jab saptahik press conference se baahar nikal rahi thi tabhi ek samvaadadaata ne unase poocha ki kya vah raashtrapati trump se nafrat karti hai

 But, it is about the election
 '' pelocy ne kaha, ‘‘yah america ke samvidhan ke bare main or raashtrapati ke pad ke ulanghan kii ore le jane vaale tathyon ke bare main hai
 And as a Catholic i am offended by you using the word 'hate' in a sentence
 ''unhone sinclair broadcast group ke samvaadadaata ko jhidakate hue kaha, ‘‘isliye jab is tarah ke shabdon kii baat ho to mujhase mat ulajhie

 The school runs in the empty lab of the college before regular college classes begin
 college ke chaatr or karmchaaree samay nikaal kar yahaan padhaate hai or samaaj ke kamjor tabake ke bachche yahaan padhane ke liye aate hai
 After checking the qualification level of the children in the school, they get admission in different classes

" ''majdoor jab jagah chhodkar kahin jate hai to un bacchon ke liye skool main apni padhai jari rakhana sambhav nahin ho paata
 In such a situation, professional education can be made a means of livelihood
 bacchon ko paper packet, jute kaa saamaan or chocolate banane ke liye workshop yojit kar training di jaati he
 Teach girls sewing-embroidery
 naitik shiksha or yoga ke liye art of living or sahaj yoga ke satr yojit kiye jate hai

 Veteran leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee made Uttar Pradesh capital Lucknow a BJP stronghold in his time
 lekin beete vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke paksh main chali aandhi main sameekaran is kadar badale kii bhaajapa kaa yah abhedya garh bhi dhah gaya
 The BJP, which was badly beaten in the assembly elections in Lucknow, is now trying to save the reputation in Atal's stronghold in the civic elections
 is baar bhaajapa pratyaashee dinesh sharma or congress ke ummidavaar niraj bora aamane-saamne hai
 If you look at the history, since 1995, BJP has occupied this prestigious municipal corporation seat of the state
 sharma se pehle atal ke najdiki maane jane vaale es
 C
 raay do baar yahaan se mahayor rahe
 In the year 2006, Sharma replaced Rai and became the Mayor
 bhaajapa ne ek baar phir sharma par daav khelaa he, or ab yah kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa he ki shamaa, raay kaa itihaas doharaa paaenge yaa nahin
 This time the challenges are too much for the BJP candidate
 party ke bheetar bhi unka virodh ho rahaa he
 The protest even went so far that only three BJP people filed a claim against him
 varisht netaaon ke samajhane ke baad unhone naam to waapas le liye lekin unke log abhi bhi sharma ke khilaaf prachaar main jute hai
 Atal is neither a MP from Lucknow nor is there any hope of his return to Lucknow
 atal antim baar varsh 2006 ke nagar nigam chunaav main ek din ke liye yahaan prachaar karne aae the
 He was then an MP from Lucknow
 atal ne lakhanu ke kapoorthala main saarvajanik sabha main kaha tha, 'kishoravastha se hi lakhanu ke logon se hameshaa maangata rahaa hum or miltaa bhi rahaa he
 Now i am old and i hope that Lucknow, which gives everything to teenagers and young Atal, will not disappoint even old Atal
 'atal kii un maarmik panktiyon ko yaad karte hue lakhanu ke ek vayovridgh samajasevi, 75 varshiya ramesh sangwan kehete hai, 'atal ji kii panktiyaan aaj bhi kaanon main goonjati rahati hai
 People of Lucknow do not know when he will have his darshan, but if he were in the electoral scenario today, the BJP would not have suffered so much
 'bhaajapa ke ranneetikaron ko bhi atal jaise prakhar vaktaa kii kami mahasoos ho rahi he
 Because of Atal, Lucknow remained a BJP stronghold for years, but now the situation has reversed
 atal ke garh main bhaajapa kii pratishtha bachaane ke liye sharma ko edi-chotii kaa jor lagaana hoga or vah bhi aise samay main jab unke apane hi unki naiya duubone main lage hue hai
 The situation between India and Pakistan is becoming tense
 lekin bharat kii aadhikarik pratikriyaayein behad sadhi or sanyamit hai, jabaki iske thik ulat pakistan kii aadhikarik pratikriyaayein bhi jhooth kii buniyaad par tiki hai
 Pakistan's media is serving lies
 aapako bataate hai ki mangalvaar ko jab bhartiya vayusena ne ection liya tha tab se lekar ab tak pakistan ne kaisaa-kaisaa jhooth bolaa he
 Meanwhile, India has summoned the acting High Commissioner of Pakistan regarding each and every act of Pakistan
 pakistan ne naa sirf hawaii seemaa todi he, balki sainya thikaanon ko target kiya he
 Whereas India took anti-terror - non-military action in Balakot on 26 February
 kyonki pakistan aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf ection lene main naakaam rahaa he
 Pakistan's 10 F-16 aircraft flew from different places
 inkaa target naushera main army brigade headquarter or oil depo tha
 These fighter jets flew from Islamabad, Nurkhan and Sargodha airbases
 bhartiya radar kii pakad main ye subah 9 bajkar 52 minute par aa gaye the
 Immediately 4 Sukhoi-30 and 2 mig-21 fighter aircraft flew from Srinagar and Avantipura
 naushera sector main subah 10 baje bhartiya vayusima main pakistan ke ladaaku vimaan ghuse
 Within two minutes, he had an encounter with Indian fighters in the sky of Rajouri
 pakistani ladaaku vimaan turant waapas laute or lautate-lautate hi unka ek F-16 vimaan ko bhartiya sena ne maar giraaya
 But in this air encounter, we had to lose one of the two mig-21 aircraft
 ab pakistan ne jo harakat kii he, us par bharat ke paas jawaab dene kaa adhikaar he
 It is an attacking act on which decisive action will be taken
 pakistan kii sena or sarkaar aatankiyon par aankh moond kar baithi he
 Documents on the evidence of jaish-e-mohammed being involved in the Pulwama attack are given
 pakistan inkaar naa kare balki in sabooton ke dastauez ke aadhaar par turant ection le
 Pakistan was also told that the Indian pilots who are in their possession should be released immediately
 jis tarah se bhartiya payalat ke saath bartaav kiya gaya, wo geneva kanvension ke khilaaf he
 The injured Indian soldier has been treated uncivilly by going against international rules
 pakistan samaj le ki bhartiya payalat ko koi bhi nuksaan nahin pahunchnaa chahie

 Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a military court in Pakistan for espionage, is not even aware of where and under what condition he is presently
 bhartiya videsh mantralay ne kaha ki pakistan ne is bare main koi jaankaree nahin di he
 Every effort will be made to save Jadhav, the son of the whole of India, with this, the Government of India made it clear that whatever is possible will be done to save Kulbhushan Jadhav from the gallows
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa gopal baagle ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki jadhav sirf apane parivaar kaa nahin, balki puure bharat kaa betaa he or puure desh ke logon kii bhavanaaen unase judi hui hai
 When the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson was asked what steps the Indian government could take to save Jadhav, he refused to elaborate, but said that efforts are going on in this regard
 videsh mantralay ne kaha ki kulbhushan jadhav ke upar jasusi ke aarope to lagaae ja rahe hai, lekin bharat ke pratinidhi ko unase nahin milane diya ja rahaa he
 For this request has been sent to Pakistan 13 times and further efforts will continue
 pakistan ke daavon main bad jholgopal baagle ne kaha ki ki yah hairaani kii baat he ki kulbhushan jadhav par jasusi kaa aarope bhi lagaaya ja rahaa he or yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki unke paas se bhartiya passport mila
 Any man can understand that an agent who has gone for espionage will not travel with his country passport in his pocket
 videsh mantralay ne kaha, sachai yah he ki jadhav ek nirdosh bhartiya naagarik hai, jo pehle nausena main kaam karte the or ritairement lene ke baad iran main apana bijness kar rahe the, jahaan se unka apharan kar liya gaya
 Bagle also said, but how he reached Pakistan can be known in detail only if the Government of Pakistan gives permission to meet him
 unhone kaha ki kulbhushan jadhav ke saath jo kuch hua he, use iran sarkaar ko bhi bataaya ja chukaa he, kyonki vah iran main hi apana bijness kar rahe the
 The External Affairs Ministry spokesperson reiterated the statement given by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj that India is constantly saying that the way Kulbhushan Jadhav was sentenced to death is against the whole process of justice
 agar unke khilaaf koi bhi kadam uthaaya jaataa he, to bharat ise sochi samajhi hatya hi maanegaa
 Kulbhushan Jadhav, arrested in March 2016 on charges of being an Indian spy in Pakistan, has been sentenced to death

 pehla jhatka shivasena ne diyabijepi ko pehla jhatka shivasena ne diya he
 Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray passed the proposal to single-handedly contest the 2019 elections at the party's national executive meeting
 itnaa hi nahin unhone kaha, 'main kasam khaataa hum ki apane dam par desh ke sabhi rajyon main chunaav ladenge
 Whether win or lose
 ' shivasena ne somvaar ko dobaaraa bijepi ko gherte hue saamana main likhaa ki bijepi yuti (gathbandhan) dharm kaa paalan nahin karti balki mitra dalon ko kamjor karne main use anand miltaa he
 The Shiv Sena said, "this is the bjp's practice that it should be in power in alliance with regional parties in the state and then gradually spread its hands and feet by clawing at the allies
" saamana main kaha gaya ki saal 2014 kii modi lahar ko ekataraf rakh do, ab 2019 ke chunaavon main dekhenge ki bijepi ke kitne saansad jitkar aate hai
 The time has come that BJP will no longer get good friends for the alliance in the country's politics, so they will have to find friends from another planet
 'shivasena ke is tevar se saaf lag rahaa he ki donon dalon ke rishte ab bahut dinon tak chalane vaale nahin he
 In such a situation, if the two parties separate, then not only BJP but Shiv Sena may also have to suffer loss in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bataa den ki donon partiyon ke ek hi votbank he
 In such a situation, there will be a split of votes due to the two fighting separately and the congress-ncp alliance is expected to get its political advantage

 Not only this, the closeness between BJP and Jagan Reddy's party has also increased

 Rajbhar, while giving a warning in PM Modi's constituency, attacked his own government and said that corruption has not decreased during the tenure of this government but has increased
 unhone kaha ki centre kii sarkaar pichde or garibon ke boote bani he

 (plastic surgery done by Hema Malini, driver released on bail) banpar fasal kii vajah se bharat kaa 'tuar daal' main vishwa ke sabase bade utpaadak desh kaa darja barkaraar he
 The condition of farmers is poor due to the price of tur dal, also known as yellow pulse, being lower than the minimum support price of the government in the open market
 unke jakhmon par namak chhidakane vaali baat ye he ki desh main banpar utpaadan ke baavjood sarkaar ne is daal kaa baahar se aayaat karnaa jari rakhaa hua he
 Domestic producers are paying only half the price the government is asking for from outside
 protein kii prachurtaa kii vajah sepili dalko aam aadmi ke liye protein kaa aasaani se uplabdh hone vaala saadhan mana jaataa he
 But now these lentils have become the net of life for its producers
 madhya pradesh ke narsinghpur jile main kisaanon main se ek deepak hai jo adhik jameen par pili daal kaa utpaadan kar pachhataa rahe hai
 Deepak decided to produce it in more area after the price of yellow dal reached Rs 200 per kg in the retail market last year
 centre sarkaar ne jab mozambik se 9000 rupye prati quintal ke hisaab se pili daal mangane kaa elaan kiya to deepak ko apana faisla sahi najar aayaa
 Like Deepak and farmers, yellow dal was grown in more area
 is saal pili daal kii bahut acchhee paidaavaar hui lekin kisaanon ke chehre phir bhi murajhaae hue hai
 Actually, prices of yellow lentils have also come down sharply
 kharaab quality ke naam par nahin ho rahi kharidariek taraf sarkaar mozambik se 9000 rupye prati quintal ke hisaab se pili daal kharid rahi he
 For domestic producers, the support price of yellow lentils has been kept at Rs 5050 per quintal
 deepak ne india today ko bataaya ki sarkaar 5050 rupye prati quintal ke hisaab se pili daal kharid to rahi he lekin adhiktar maatra ko kharaab quality ke naam par khaarij kar rahi he
 Another farmer Sunil Jat raised similar concerns
 sunil jat ne kaha, 'hamane pichley saal pili daal kaa adhik jameen par utpaadan karne kaa faisla kiya
 Some lentils have deteriorated due to rain and hail
 ab sarkaar ise ghatiya quality kaa bataa kar nahin kharid rahi
 'where the farmers are taking advantage, the farmers are suffering and the traders have become there
 jab sarkari agenciyaan kisaanon se daal kharidne se inkaar kar detii hai to ye kaarobaari kisaanon se oune-paune daamon main daal kharid lete hai
 Farmers also have no other choice
 agar wo daal ko waapas le jaaen yaa khule main choden to or nuksaan kaa dar rahata he
 In Narsinghpur, traders are paying Rs 3000 to 4000 per quintal for yellow pulses
 krishi mantri gauri shankar bisen sekisaanon keebadahali par ajtak ne baat kii to ye jawaab mila, 'ye sach he ki sarkaar ne mozambik ke saath dirghakaalin daal kharid samjhauta kiya tha or wo ab bhi jari he
 This is because the government has to honor the agreement
 lekin ab ye kisaanon ke hiton se takaraa rahaa he
 'the government while signing a long-term import contract in July 2016 had made it clear that as domestic production increases, the import of pulses will be reduced
 lekin lagata he ki sarkaar ko apni ye baat yaad nahin rahi he or 'anndaata' kisaan ko pareshaan hona pad rahaa he

 baithak shuru hote hi sabhi netaaon ne ek sur main rahul gandhi se adhyaksh bane rahane kii apil kii
 It was said in the meeting that without Rahul Gandhi how will the party run? However, Rahul once again refused to take up this position

 in teen naamon main rahul gandhi, priyanka gandhi or mukul vaasanic ke naam shaamil hai
 However, very few people have taken the name of Wasnik, but apart from Rahul and Priyanka, only their names have been taken
 congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhirahuunga sakriy- rahulavahin, rahul gandhi ne ye bhi kaha ki aap log ye mat sochie ki, main adhyaksh nahin rahoonga to sakriy nahin rahoonga
 You guys are getting it wrong, i will be active many times more
 janata ke bich zyada rahoonga
 i will have more time
 isliye aap log nayaa adhyaksh chun lijie
 Earlier, after the meeting, the media in-charge of the Congress, Randeep Singh Surjewala, said that a strong opposition is needed in view of the current situation and Rahul Gandhi is the only person to lead it
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki sabhi ne rahul gandhi se adhyaksh bane rahane kii apil kii, lekin unhone apana istipha waapas lene se inkaar kar diya
 Surjewala said that five committees have been formed for the selection of the chairman
 ye cameti raat ko apni report pesh karengi
 It is being told that at around 8 pm on Saturday night, the Congress Working Committee will meet again and once again there will be a churn in the name of the Chairman
 isus pehle baithak shuru hone ke baad jone ke hisaab se suzav ke liye netaaon kii paanch team banaai gai, jisamen sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke naam bhi the
 But Sonia Gandhi objected to this and said that she and Rahul Gandhi cannot be part of the election process of the president
 iske baad sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi congress varking cameti kii baithak se baahar chale gaye hai
 After coming out, Sonia Gandhi said that it is not right to put Rahul and his name in the process of president selection
 sonia gandhi ne yah bhi bataaya ki cameti kii list main rahul or unka naam galati se aa gaya tha
 However, now it has to be seen that when the five groups put their report before the CWC at eight o'clock, whose name comes up as the Interim President of Congress

 In his childhood, Jeet Bahadurjit Bahadur, the son of Modi's religion, left the family and came to India in search of livelihood, but luck struck him with Narendra Modi
 narendra modi ne jeet bahadur ko apane dharm putr, apane chote bhai kii tarah rakhaa
 Wrote her studies like an ideal guardian, took care of all her happiness
 narendra modi ko jeet bahadur bada bhai kahata he, saath hi wo mahasoos bhi karata he ki narendra modi uske liye bade bhai hi nahin jindagi main sab kuch hai
 Prior to Narendra Modi's visit to Nepal, his family members had hoped that Modi would come to Nepal with Jeet Bahadur and hand over his son to his mother
 jeet bahadur kaa jo parivaar kuch vakt pehle tak roji roti ke liye pareshaan tha, do june kii roti jiske liye muhaal thi, wo dekhte hi dekhte surkhiyon main chaa gaya tha
 The entire family was going live on Nepali television channels

 jis andaaj main narendra modi ne jeet bahadur ke ghar waalon ko khoja tha, wo to or bhi anokhaa tha
 Actually, this whole story is like the script of a film
 fark bas ye he ki ye kahani puri tarah sachhee he
 The story of this unique relationship flowing between the hearts was first shown to you by Aaj Tak
 ajtak ne hi pehali baar 31 july ko narendra modi ke is dharmaputra kii daastaan aapako dikhaai thi
 For the first time, people had seen this Jeet Bahadur of Nepal, whom Narendra Modi brought up, like no one gives to his friends
 hamane pehle hi kaha tha ki jeet bahadur kii jindagi daastaan kisi film kii patakatha jaisi he
 We have to take you to the flashback to show his full story
 nepal ke navalparasi jile kaa laukaha gaanv
 The poverty rate in this village is much more spread
 isi gaanv main jeet bahadur ne ankhen kholi thi
 In 1998, at the age of just ten, Jeet Bahadur left home in search of work
 saath main uskaa bada bhai dasharath bhi tha
 Some days he worked in Delhi and then moved to Rajasthan
 rajasthan main uskaa man nahin laga or wo vahaan se bhagkar apane ghar pahunchnaa chahta tha lekin jeet bahadur kii kismat main to kuch or hi likhaa tha
 He wanted to go back to his village from Rajasthan
 gorakhpur ke liye use train pakadani thi, lekin galati se wo gorakhpur kii bajaay ahmedabad kii train main baith gaya
 He had to go to Gorakhpur and reached Ahmedabad
 ahmedabad jeet bahadur ke liye ek nai duniya thi
 Luckily, he met Narendra Modi
 narendra modi us vakt gujarat ke mukhyamantri the
 This is in 2002, when Jeet Bahadur was 14 years old, Narendra Modi made arrangements for his living, reading and writing, seeing his future
 jeet bahadur kii kismat badal gai
 He was possessed by a person like Narendra Modi
 lekin nepal ke uske gaanv main logon ne aas kho di thi ki kabhi ab jeet bahadur se bhent hogi
 Modi completed his promise in 2011
 us vakt nepal ke udyogpati vinod choudhary fikki ke nimantran par ek kaarykram main ahmedabad gaye the
 Narendra Modi also reached that event
 vinod choudhary ne mulaakaat ke dauraan narendra modi se nepal aane kaa nyotaa de diya
 Then Narendra Modi conditioned him to come to Nepal
 kaha ki agar wo unke ghar rah rahe jeet bahadur naam ke nepali ladke ke parivaar kaa pataa laga den to wo nepal jarur aaenge
 Vinod Chaudhary not only traced Jeet Bahadur's family within 30 hours after his return from Ahmedabad, but also got the family members to talk to Jeet Bahadur
 aakhirkaar 12 baras baad 2011 main jeet bahadur apane ghar pahunchaa
 She also had that picture in which Narendra Modi was shaking hands with her
 puure parivaar se jab unhone (modi ne) jeet bahadur ko milwaaya to vahaan jaise khushiyon kaa mela lag gaya
 Found a separated son from his mother
 bahan or bhai se bichhada bhai mila
 In this union there was a confluence of blood and heart relationships
 jeet bahadur kii kahani nepali media main pahunchi to wo vahaan hero kii tarah chaa gaya
 This is Modi's first visit to Nepal after becoming Prime Minister and when Modi reached there, he was accompanied by Nepal's son and his son Jeet Bahadur
 do baras baad jeet bahadur ek baar phir pahunchaa to wo nepal ke liye kisi viipi se kam nahin tha
 After all, Jeet Bahadur is the son of Nepal, whose guardian is the Prime Minister of India

 All the mlas had already been informed about Prime Minister Modi's contact on the phone

 You can either go to Badrinath and Kedarnath or go to the Golden Temple
 ’gadakari ne kaha ki purv doorsanchaar mantri e
 Raja is repeatedly saying that he was not alone in the 2G spectrum scam and some Congress people were also involved in it
 bhaajapa adhyaksh ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki janata party ke netaa subrahmanyam swami ne unhen bataaya he ki kal vah ucchtam nyaayalay main kuch aise dastavej pesh karne ja rahe hai, jo khalabali machaa denge
 Gadkari cited corruption and misplaced policies in the Congress-led UPA government as the cause of rising inflation and poverty
 unhone kaha ki uttarakhand ko audyogic package dene se inkaar kar centre sarkaar rajya ke logon ko bhaajapa ke paksh main matdaan karne kii sajaa de rahi he
 Gadkari said, 'you can oppose the BJP, but you should not punish the people
 is package se yuvaaon ko badi sankhya main naukariyaan di ja sakati thim
 ' loksabhaa chunaav kii ghoshnaa hone main ab sirf kuch din dinon kii baat he
 But the question is whether the opposition is not able to find any major issue against the BJP under the power of the Center and Uttar Pradesh under the leadership of PM Modi
 centre main congress rafel ko mudda banane kii koshish kar rahi he lekin uskaa saath baaki badi vipakshi partiyaan nahin de rahi hai
 In Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the death toll from poisonous alcohol has reached 72
 is mudde par bhi vipaksh kii ore se sarkaar ko katghare main khadaa karne kii koi koshish nahin dikhaai de rahi he
 Let us tell you that in Uttar Pradesh, the death toll due to drinking poisonous liquor has reached 44
 marane waalon main 36 log saharanpur ke hai jabaki 8 log kushinagar ke hai
 After the incident came to light, the police has arrested more than 30 people in this case so far
 kai police adhikariyon ko tatkaal prabhaav se nilambit kar diya he
 Apart from this, the Excise Officers of both the districts have also been directed to run a joint operation against the illegal liquor with the police for 15 days
 uttar pradesh ke alaava uttarakhand main bhi shuukravaar ko 28 logon kii maut kii khabar ai thi jahaan 8 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 The Uttarakhand government has ordered an inquiry from the magistrate in the case
 donon rajyon ko milakar marane waalon kii sankhya 72 ho gai he
 The question is whether the governments were waiting for the death of these 72 people before this swift action
 jahrili sharaab se mauton kii ye ghatnaayen koi nahin he or yah bhi tay he ki bina sthaneey prashasan kii mileebhagat ke jahrili sharaab kii bhatthiyaan nahin sulgaai ja sakati hai
 The question is that every time people lose their lives and the governments divide the compensation and defend the case
 hairaani kii baat yah bhi he ki vipaksh bhi sarkaar se in mauton kaa jawaab nahin maang rahaa he
 Perhaps the reason may be that the tenure of any party is not untouched by these events
 rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne anuchhed 370 hataane or naagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak jaise ahm muddon par vipaksh ko bharose main na lene ke liye narendra modi sarkaar kii aalochana kii he
 In an interview, the Congress leader also expressed concern over the economic slowdown in the country and said that the bjp-led NDA government's attitude towards running the country was "not good"
 gahalot ne kaha ki loktantr main logon kii raay or vipaksh myne rakhata he or sarkaar ke khilaaf asantosh ko rajdroh ke mukademe daayar kar yaa logon ko raashtra-virdohi bataakar dabaaya nahin ja saktaa

 The Supreme Court has upheld the death sentence of the culprits of the Nirbhaya incident
 puure desh ne sarvocch adaalat ke is faisle kaa swaagat kiya he
 Five years later, justice was received in this case, but in the meantime a big question is also in front of everyone, will these culprits really be hanged? Actually, there are many strong reasons for this question to arise, which somewhere makes this question stronger
 das varshon main 1300 ko faansee kii sajabharat main sajaa-e-maut virale se virale maamalon main hi die jane kaa praavdhaan he
 If the tendency of crime is very serious, then the convict is sentenced to life imprisonment
 adaalatein bhi sajaa-e-maut kam hi maamalon main sunaati hai
 According to a report of 2014, during the last 10 years, more than 1300 criminals of Kofansi have been convicted in India
 keval paanch logon ko mili fonsijin 1300 logon ko faansee kii sajaa di gai, unamem se keval paanch logon ko hi faansee ke fande par latakaaya gaya
 There is a huge difference in the number of people getting punished and hanged
 yaheen antar us sawaal ko bal detaa he ki kya nirbhaay ke doshiyon ko bhi sajaa-e-maut di ja sakegi
 They were hanged only in 22 years
 During the last 22 years, only five people were hanged
 jisamen 1999 main auto shankar, 2004 main dhananjay chatarji, 2012 main aamir ajmal kasaab or 2013 main afjal guru or 2015 main yaqub memon ko faansee par latakaaya gaya
 According to an estimate, about 125 people get hanged every year in India, but they are not implemented
 jisaki vajah he is sajaa kii lambii prakriya or uske baad ke vikalp
 Three options even after the sentence In fact, three options remain open to challenge the verdict even before the Supreme Court sentenced to death
 jinamein punarvichaar yachika, raashtrapati ke yahaan dayaa yachika or curative yachika kaa vikalp shaamil hai
 These options are also seen to be the cause of this question being born somewhere
 punarvichaar yachikanirbhaya gang rape or hatya ke chaaron doshiyon kosupreme courtki teen jajon kii khandpeeth ne faansee kii sajaa sunai he
 But these three can still file a review petition before the big bench to avoid death
 badi khanthpeetha se aashay he, teen jajon se zyada jajon vaali khandpeeth
 In which the matter can be heard again
 raashtrapati ke samaksh dayaa yachikugar doshiyon kii punarvichaar yachika bhi khaarij ho jaati he, to ye chaaron raashtrapati ke samaksh dayaa yachika daakhil kar apni jaan bakhshane kii guhaar laga sakate hai
 After this, it is entirely up to the President to either uphold his death sentence or convert him to life imprisonment
 raashtrapati mantrimandal kii salaah par is bare main faisla lete hai
 Curative petition: a petition is filed when both the mercy petition sent to the President of a convict and the review petition filed in the Supreme Court are dismissed
 iske tahat supreme court apane hi faislon par punarvichaar karne ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he
 But the petitioner has to explain on what basis he is challenging the decision of the Supreme Court
 ab kya karenge nirbhaya cond ke doshibharat main sajaa-e-maut kaa itihaas is baat kaa gavaah he
 Even criminals who have been sentenced to death by the Supreme Court are not able to go to the gallows
 jisaki vajah he kanoon main doshiyon ko milane vaale vikalp or maanav adhikaar sangrakshan sambandhi praavdhaan
 However, now it will be interesting to see what option the four convicts in the Nirbhaya case will now use after getting the punishment

 The Supreme Court-appointed SIT has stamped the 'action and reaction' principle of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in the Gulberg Society massacre case, saying that in 2002, 69 people died as a result of the firing of former MP Ehsan Jafri
 esaiti ne jaafaree kii vidhwaa jakia jaafaree dwaara modi par lagaae gaye is khaas aarope ke sandarbh main unhen paak saaf qaraar diya he ki unhone (modi ne) ek nijee televijan channel or akhbaar ke saath saakshaatkaar main aapattijanak bayaan diya tha or newton ke kriya or pratikriya siddhant kaa hawala diya tha
 The SIT said that according to the correspondent of the private TV channel, Modi had described Jafri's firing as 'action' and the subsequent massacre as 'reaction'
 esaiti report main kaha gaya he, ‘saakshaatkaar ke dauraan jab gulburg sosayadi narsanhaar ke bare main sawaal kiya gaya jisamen purv saansad ehsaan jaafaree or 69 maare gaye the, tab mukhyamantri ne in khabaron kaa hawala diya ki jaafaree ne pehle hinsak bheed par goliyaan chalaai thi jisase bheed bhadak gayi or uske baad vah houseing sosayadi par tut padi or usamen aag laga di
 The SIT report stated that the exact statement was- 'the action reaction chain is moving
 ham chaahate hai ki na kriya ho or naa pratikriya
 When the reporter was asked by Modi about the widespread violence that followed the Godhra carnage in Gujarat, he replied, "the day after in Godhra, where 40 women and children were burnt alive, it led to the nation and abroad It was natural to get shocked
 godhra ke is ilaake ke logon kii criminal tendency rahi he, in logon ne pehle mahila teacher kaa khun kiya tha or ab ye jaghanya aparaadh kiya he jisaki pratikriya ho rahi he
 Modi gave this interview on March 1, 2002 while the Godhra train fire incident took place on February 27, 2002
 esaity ne unke is bayaan ke liye unhen paak saaf qaraar dete hue kaha ki mukhyamantri narendra modi ke ye tathakthith bayaan unke khilaaf maamla banaae jane ke liye kaaphi nahin hai
 In its conclusion, the SIT said, "in this connection, it should be said that Narendra Modi in his interview clearly stated that it was the late former MP Ehsan Jaffrey who first fired at the violent mob and the angry mob cracked down on the society and it Set fire apane saakshaatkaar main unhone spasht rup se jaafaree kii golibari ko kriya or uske baad hue narsanhaar ko ‘pratikriya’ bataaya
 The SIT report further states, "it can be clarified that Jafri's firing on the mob could have led to immediate provocative action which was gathered there to avenge the Godhra incident of Muslims
" ’newton ke siddhant kaa hawala dekar godhra pashchaat cond ke bare main press bayaan ke silsile main modi ne kaha ki unhone ek pramukh dainik ko koi saakshaatkaar nahin diya
 The SIT report says that according to Modi no reporter met him
 unhone aage kaha ki unke tathakthith ‘kriya-pratikriya’ story ke bare main jhooth is tathy se ujagar ho jaataa he
 The SIT says that Modi has categorically denied the allegations that he had justified the riots by citing the 'action-reaction' theory
 mukhyamantri ne yah bhi kaha ki yah unka mat rahaa he ki hinsa ke badale hinsa nahin ho sakati he or unhone shanti kii apil kii thi
 The SIT vigorously defended the Chief Minister against this charge, citing his interrogation of Modi in March 2010
 usne kaha, ‘ek march, 2002 ko jitivi ke saakshaatkaar ke silsile main modi ne esaiti se kaha ki aath saal baad vah sateek shabd to yaad nahin kar paa rahe hai lekin unhone hameshaa hi shanti or bas shanti kii apil kii
 "the SIT report says," he (modi) also said that if his vocabulary is considered in the right context on this question, it will become clear that the honest appeal to people to stay away from any form of violence Was done
 ’editors gild kii pustak ‘ritis and rong’ main tivi saakshaatkaar ke ansh hai
 The SIT had questioned the TV correspondent and asked him to give the CD of the interview
 lekin samvaadadaata ne esaiti kaha tha ki unke paas sidi nahin he lekin usne samaran kar kaha ki modi ne usase kya kaha tha

 jab ek baar khilaadi sirf manoranjak kii apni bhoomika nibhaate hue marane se batch gaya ho or uske baad bhi aap use paise na dekar apamaanit kiye ja rahe hon, to yah uski gaal par ek joardaar tamaacha hota he
 
 
 When Tillakaratne raised the issue of fixing in his days and expressed his doubts about this team, his own board fell behind him
 pakistani wicketiper julkarnain haidar ne 2010 main bataaya ki fiksaron ke saath khilne se manaa karne par unhen dhamkaaya gaya
 The players and the Pakistan Cricket Board together questioned their understanding and mental state at that time
 jab unhone suraksha kaarnon se dakshin africa ke khilaaf dubai main kheli jane vaali siries se haath khinch liye to un par jurmaana thok diya gaya
 Essex player Tony Palladino, who described fixing, was treated so lonely (he complained of spot-fixing against fellow player Mervyn Westfield in a 2009 County match against Durham)
 bisisiai ne ek doshi fiksar mazhar majid ke us daawey ko gambhirtha se nahin liya ki uski pahunch bhartiya khiladinnon tak he
 xxrep 4 * The looted empire Modi Kamodi says that he opposed the underworld's attempts to fix the match, the ACSU (anti Corruption and Security Unit) record in prosecuting players is not good
 2000 ke baad se sirf do khiladinnon par faisla hua he
 One is West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels, who was banned for two years for providing information to a bookie
 or duusare khilaadi hai kenya ke purv captain morris odumbe
 He was banned for five years in 2004 on charges of taking money from bookies
 asiesu mazhar majid se paidaa hue khatre se nibatane ke maamle main bhi dhimaa rahaa
 Twice he missed the opportunity
 srilanka main 2010 main asiesu kaa afasar jaanata tha ki salmaan bat or uske ek saathi ne hotel se baahar nikalne ke liye team prabandhan se jhooth bolaa he
 He said that he wanted to go and eat Pakistani food while he was going to meet Majeed
 is ‘khel’ se waakif ek shaks ne 2010 kii garmiyon kii shuruyaat main majid ke blueberi se downlod kiye hue sandesh asiesu ko mail kar die
 ACSU said it did not have enough people to act on it
 tab us shaks ne news of da world kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 ACSU does not have the knowledge of betting
 southwork main spot phixing kii sunwaayee ke dauraan jab asiesu ke mahaprabandhak ke pad se 2011 main hate ravi savani ne kaha ki unhen nahin maaloom bracket kya hota he, to court main logon ko vishwaas hi nahin hua
 This was a major push to acsu's credibility
 condon (asiesu ke purv adhyaksh lord paul condon) or main is baat se asahmat hai ki asiesu ne pehle jin ajeebgarib pahaluon par satta laga hone kii baat kahi thi, bharat main un par satta lagaaya janaa vastav main mumkin he? masalan, gendbaaj kis chor se gend phenkega, fielding kii sthiti, alag-alag gendon ke no ball yaa wide hone par satta
 i suggested to him that despite having a thick understanding of the gambling here, there seems to be a doubt that such betting is possible here
 vajah: sattebaajon kii kaam karne kii style
 i told Lalit Modi that in Lord Kondon's opinion, India's illegal speculative businesses are not run by people whom Modi claims are bent on killing him
 modi ek tarah se cheekhte hue poochhate hai, ‘‘ye log kahaan rahete hai? kis grah par rahete hai? main yah sunakar sadame main hum
 i have been attacked three times due to my attitude against corruption
 ’’iske baad modi un teenon ghatnaon ke bare main bataate hai or daawa karte hai ki ye hamale isliye karwaae gaye kyonki unhone ipiel maichon ko fiks karne main gangstaron ke aage ghutane techne se inkaar kar diya tha
 An attack took place in Mumbai in late March 2009
 ve bataate hai, ‘‘mere ghar ke baahar goli chali jisamen ek maaraa gaya or ek pakadaa gaya
 The second attack took place in South Africa in April of the same year and again in January 2010 in Phuket, Thailand
 har maukey par unhen police ne yaa guptchar agenciyon ne aagaah kar diya tha
 "the entire system of underground betting in India ends at the tip of a pyramid," says Modi
 ve log ‘book’ hote hai
 Everyone else is bookie
 kuch bharat main hote hai, kuch baahar, kuch madhya-purv main bhi
 Their reach in India is also well known in other industries
 kai logon or netaaon ke saath bhi unki acchhee pahunch hoti he
 Many of them are people with very respectable faces
 saamne aane vaale chehre aapako is baat kaa ehsaas bhi nahin hone denge ki unke peeche koun he
 "what were the allegations of match fixing in the IPL tournament? In his words, was Modi the respected face?" He says, "concocted blank imagination, just to discredit
" kuch log mere peeche pade hai or ve mere khilaaf maahaul bananaa chaahate hai
 This is very bad
 ’’bhrashtachar ko lekar ipiel kii chhavi pehle se hi kharaab he
 ACSU was concerned that it did not have enough people in the IPL to monitor corruption in the first two years from the ICC
 duusari ore vinay or parthiv jaise sattebaaj maichon ke fiks hone kii ummid lagaae baithe the
 Even the bookies sitting in the UK had great doubts about this tournament
 modi kehete hai, ‘‘spot phixing to khub chalati he
 i am talking about the world
 yah bhaanumati ke pitare jaisaa he
 It is happening right under your nose, but you cannot prove it
 lagbhag naammumkin he
 i am telling from my cricketing experience: after years of experience as an audience, broadcaster and administrator
 main dekhtaa or sunata rahaa hum lagaataar ki cricket main kya ho rahaa he, akele ipiel main hi nahin
 IPL is a tournament that is most closely monitored
 aisa nahin ki duusare nahin hai, lekin kya ham paryaapt intjaam kar paa rahe hai?’’‘‘phixing kai tareekon se kii ja sakati he, akele khiladinnon ke bharose ye nahin hoti
 In addition to the players, fixing happens with the people associated with the game, who have influence on the game
 jaise pich ke halaat or team ke bare main suchanaaen dene ke liye
 “obviously, the two initial ipls would not have been clean without ACSU monitoring
 kya unke bhrashtachar mukt hone kaa daawa sambhav he? modi kehete hai, ‘‘main maanata hum ki ve saaf-suthere the, lekin aaj yahaan baithkar main aapako ye to nahin kah saktaa ki hamane spot phixing kii ek-ek gunjaaish hi khatm kar di thi, or yah to ipiel kya, har khel main hota he
 It is very difficult to catch
 hamane stadium main kuch avaanchit tatv dekhe, unhen turant nikaal baahar kiya
 We saw that they were going around with the managers of the players who were in contact with the players or the bookies and we removed them
 ’’modi ne pichhali mulaakaat main mujhe kuch khiladinnon ke naam die the jinke bare main ve maanate the ki ve ‘avaanchhiton’ ke saath jude hai
 This was, however, before Cairns' case won by defamation suit against him
 isse unki baat juthi sabit ho gai
 He now laughs and says, "I have to be cautious now
 main manahani kaa ek or mukadmaa nahin chahta, na hi goli khaanaa chahta hum
 "the players whom he named, there are so many big stars that the language will be cut off by taking names
" ve kehete hai, ‘‘haa, bade naam to hai
 And today i know big players from all over the world who play friendship with big bookies
 yah kanoonee ho yaa gaiyr-kanoonee, lekin mujhe samaj nahin aata ki isaki ijaajat kyon di jaani chahie
 "modi said," Sometimes i had to talk to the players
 or yah baat kuch aisi hua karti thi, ‘‘hamane nahin kiya, yah sach nahin, yah paristhitigat tha, main? ye kaise ho saktaa he? main? ’’ or aise hi baat chalati thi
 i used to say, "we know about ourselves, we know about you too, so keep it out of the game
" agali galati nahin honi chahie
 He had an excuse for everything
 har cheez kaa jawaab tha
 Modi kept saying, "if players are easy victims, then there is nothing anyone can do about it
" iske liye ipiel ko dosha nahin diya janaa chahie
 What is the fault of Twenty20? ACSU has blamed the first Twenty20
 ab chaahe vah twanti-20 ho, vanade ho yaa test, vahi saare khilaadi alag-alag formet main khelte hai
 Once the bookie tasted the money, he would take his share from you instead
 vah yah bhi tay kar legaa ki kisi bhi formet main aapkaa sahyog mil jaae

 He is a cricket photographer who travels around the world during the Indian team's tour

 Pakistani-origin Bollywood actress Veena Malik has claimed to be involved in his fixing
 unhone is kahani main romaanch daal diya
 Everything else was already there in Pakistan's spot fixing scandal
 vinaa malik pakistani cricket khilaadi mohammad asif kii garlfriend rahi hai, vahi asif jinhen no ball phenkane kaa doshi paaya gaya tha or sajaa mili thi
 Veena came to expose Dixit's fixer on Indian television
 unhone kaha ki dikshit or asif phixing ke liye bangkok main mili the or unhone apni baat sabit karne ke liye isisi ke asiesu ko unki phone recording muhaiyaa karai he
 On Dixit's claim, Veena gave a TV statement, "come with evidence
" 
 
 kisi mahila ke charitra par keechad oochaalnaa sabase aasaan kaam he
 "dixit, who considers himself Asif's" very good friend ", was also not silent and a quarrel-like war started between them
 dikshit bole ki veena hi sattebaaj mazahar majid or khiladinnon ke bich kii kadi thim
 The same Mazhar Majeed who was jailed in the Southwork trial of Asif, Salman Butt and Mohammad Aamir
 dikshit ke mutabik, vinaa unke paas ai thim ki unhen bhartiya cricketron ke sampark main rakhaa jaae
 ACSU learns about Dixit while she has 'talked' to Veena

 Dixit knows many celebrities of India

 Seen the picture? Apparently his good reach to the players attracted Veena to Dixit
 dikshit kaa kahana he ki jab ve janvari, 2010 main bhartiya team ke saath bangladesh ke daure par the to veena ne ‘‘12 baje’’ ke baad teen baar unako phone kiya or har baar unki patni ne phone uthaaya
 Veena said, "ok, can you give her mobile number of Bangladesh?" He gave

 He told me, "I am a Hindu and people in Pakistan are not safe

 She wanted to meet Indian players
 unhone kuch khiladinnon kaa naam bhi liya tha, jinase ve mil chuki thim lekin main unke naam nahin le saktaa kyonki yah samvedansheel maamla he
 Did they meet Indian players? "yes
 ’’aakhir vinaa malik bhartiya khiladinnon se kyon milanaa chaahati thim? dikshit ke anusaar, yah pakistani spot phixing main ek pech he
 He says that Veena worked for Asif and Majeed
 ‘‘majid bahut chaalaak shaks he
 i do not know him nor have i ever met him
 ’’dikshit kaa kahana he ki majid pakistani khiladinnon par apni pakad kamjor hota dekh rahaa tha
 He feared that his rival bookies were buying players, so they needed new players to corrupt them
 ‘‘majid har pakistani khilaadi se daraa hua tha
 Veena once said that she cheated Majeed
 yahi vajah he ki vah bhartiya khiladinnon ko talash rahaa he
 He told me that they ask for four times the money
 yahi vajah he ki vah mere paas ai he
 Asif said that only one man can do this work and "he is patient

 She wanted to interrupt me
 maine ‘‘manaa’’ kar diya
 i did not even get a pie

 They said to me, "come to London

 "this year's matches have already been fixed

 "dixit says that he has met Veena 'only once' and has spoken to her on the phone 'many times'
" unka daawa he ki ve vinaa kii peshkash ko record karke mukhabiri karnaa chaahate the
 He says he went to a newspaper reporter whom he considers his friend
 ‘‘maine ek senior reporter ko phone kiya ki ek pakistani ladki mujhe bharat main match fiks karne ke liye paise kaa ofer de rahi he
 He has also asked me to keep an eye on big businessmen in India
 usne mujhase jo kuch kaha tha, maine reporter ko bataa diya
 i do not want to name him
 usne mujhe bataaya ki kis prakaar uski aawaaj record kerani he
 But i did not come to record the voice while talking
 usne mujhe phone kiya or poocha, ‘‘aapane is bare main kya sochaa? main bhartiya khiladinnon se mil bhi chuki hum
 "I can't tell who he is because i can get in trouble
" maine do khiladinnon kaa naam liya jinke bare main maine bahut sun rakhaa tha ‘‘kya ye hai, hai naa

 "madhavan's first question after convincing Azharuddin was," and how long have you been selling the country
 ’’ azahruddin ne apane haathon se apana cheharaa chupa liya
 Despite all his feelings and troubles, Azharuddin was not ready to cooperate at all
 unhone apana bachaav kiya
 Although Ganapathi reported he had confessed to 'making' in three matches, but he completely denied it in front of Madhavan
 madhavan kaa kahana he, ‘‘bharat main jo koi bhi pakadaa jaataa he vah ant tak usase inkaar karata rahata he
 Even when the Supreme Court convicts, they continue to deny it
