 PN Mishra said that the High Court had admitted that Muslims could not give any evidence in this regard that Babur had made
 is babat saboot nahin hai ki 1528 main masjid kaa nirmaan kiya gaya or na hi is baat ke saboot hai ki iskaa nirmaan babar ne kiya tha
 PN Mishra said that it is clear that the mosque was built on top of the temple as the remains of the temple have been found from that place
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki mandir ko giraakar masjid bani jabaki kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki mandir ko dhwast karke masjid banaai gai
 PN Mishra said that Allahabad High Court said in its judgment that it has not been proved that Babur or Aurangzeb built the mosque by breaking the temple on the disputed land? Mishra said that Babur was not the owner of the disputed land
 aise main meraa kahana he ki jab koi saboot hi nahin he to muslim pakshakaar ko vivaadit jameen par kabja yaa hissedari nahin di ja sakati
 Mishra said that Babur did not construct the mosque nor was he the owner of the disputed land
 jab babar jameen kaa maalik hi nahin tha to sunni vakf board kaa maamle main daawa hi nahin banataa
 Justice Bobde asked PN Mishra to clarify three points that there was no dispute about whether there was a structure, but whether the structure is a mosque or not? This is the debate
 vah dhaancha kisko samarpit tha? pien mishra ne kaha ki 1648 main shahjahan kaa shashan tha or aurangzeb gujarat kaa shaasha tha
 Advocate Rajiv Dhawan of the Muslim side objected to this
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ab tak 24 baar mishra sandarbh se baahar jaakar kisse kahaniyaan suna chuke hai
 Justice Chandrachud said that he was keeping his facts, but he also asked Mishra to just give reference
 pien mishra ne kaha ki sirf court mujhe guide kar saktaa he, mere saathi vakil nahin
 Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said that you are free to keep your facts, you should be on your side
 mishra ne kaha ki is baat ke saboot nahin hai ki masjid kaa nirmaan babar ne karaayaa tha
 Justice Bobde asked that this meant Babur was not the owner of the land? PN Mishra said that the High Court had accepted by a majority that there was no evidence that Babur was the owner of the land
 unhone kaha ki hai court ne mana tha ki masjid kaa nirmaan mandir ko nasht kar kiya gaya tha
 The High Court held that the construction of the mosque was done by demolishing the temple
 babar ke kehane par mir baaki ne nirmaan kiya tha
 Justice Chandrachud asked whether this meant that the High Court had majority believed that there was no evidence that Babur had built the mosque? Mishra said that yes, there is no evidence that Babur had built the mosque
 pien mishra ne masjid banane ke bare main bahes kii ki islam main masjid banane ke kya kanoon hai
 a mosque can be built at the same place when its owner is allowed to build the mosque
 vaqf ko di gai jameen maalik kii honi chahie
 Mishra said that the Quran did not state that a mosque could be built on such land
 mishra ne kaha ki islam ke anusaar duusare ke puja sthal ko giraakar yaa dhwast karke us sthaan par masjid nahin banaai ja sakati
 a land that is occupied by two people and opposes the construction of a mosque, then a mosque cannot be built on that land
 unhone kaha ki kisi duusare dharm sthal ko giraakar uskaa saamaan istemaal karke masjid bananaa makaruh he
 He said that it is true that a mosque cannot be built on someone else's religious site by forcibly demolishing it, the mosque is built for the worship of Allah
 pien mishra ne kaha ki vivaadit dhaanche ko jume kii namaaj ke liye 2-3 ghante ke liye hi kholaa jaataa tha
 According to Islamic law, if there is an offering in the mosque and there is no two-time prayer, then it is no longer a mosque
 justise bobade ne poocha ki kya koi raja rajya kii sampatti se vakf bana saktaa he yaa use pehle sampatti kharidni hogi? mishra ne tarkhi firoz shahi kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki vijit sampatti se vijeta paarishramik ke rup main 1 / 10 kaa maalik he
 And from his remuneration he can make a waqf
 mishra ne kaha ki 1860 tak ayodhya main vivaadit dhaanche main musalamaanon ke namaaj padhane kaa koi saboot nahin he
 Justice Chandrachud asked if a king can waqf someone's property? Mishra referred to the conversation between the emperor and the Mufti, citing historical accounts
 iskaa saar tha ki raja jajia vasuul saktaa he par kisi kii jameen chhinakar vakf nahin kar saktaa
 Mishra gave details of the conversation between Hazrat Mohammad and his followers in the history of Islam about the land purchased in Khyber
 yani zamin kharidkar hi aap makbara, masjid yaa dharmik imaarat bana sakate hai
 Not by forcibly threatening, snatching or taking possession
 mishra ne kaha ki koi kitna bhi bada raja yaa hukmran ho, islam ke niyamon se alag kuch sthapit nahin kar saktaa
 No matter how powerful a king is, we cannot say that we want Hajj to be in our Sultanate from now on, it cannot be done
 masjid main paanchon vakt ke saath shuukravaar kii samuhik namaaz or azaan ho tabhi uski masjid ke rup main manyata rahati he
 If there is a Naga for two time prayers, then the mosque is not recognized
 jajia kar ke jamaane main bhi teen-teen din tak jajia ke rup main muslim sipaahi yaa log mandiron main namaaz adaa karte the lekin isse kabhi mandir masjid nahin bana
 Because, as Jaziya, that place was taken to offer Namaz
 san 1860 tak jajia kar lagu rahaa
 In lieu of this, Mughal and Muslim had been offering namaz in the temple building
 court ne poocha ki jab mandiron kii imaarat main namaaz ho sakati thi to kya masjid kii imaarat main puja nahin ho sakati? mishra ne kaha ki hindu sadiyon pehle se hi vahaan puja karte rahe hai
 Muslims later forcibly offered prayers there
 maamle kii sunwaayee shuukravaar ko bhi jari rahegi

 The special investigation till date has exposed this dangerous game of issuing fake citizens to real passports
 taaki desh kii suraksha main bheetar se paidaa kiye gaye suraakh ko band kiya ja sake
 The team investigated three passports issued at the same address
 teenon passport dilli ke humayunpur gaanv ke ek pate par jari kiye gaye the
 These passports in the names of Paru Sharma, Manisha Dubey and Barkha Yadav were issued from the Delhi Passport Office in 2015

 The fake documents were not found by looking at the papers of this passport
 lekin jab team ne maukey par jaakar pate kii asaliyat janchi to saaf ho gaya ki pataa galat he
 No address by the name of K-77, Humayumpur village is present on the spot
 humayunpur gaanv ke kai logon se poochtacha kii gai, to pataa chalaa ki ye pataa hi galat he
 Similarly, Nepali citizens have also obtained passports with wrong name and address
 sumitra mallapita kaa naam- top bahadurpata- 65-je, humayunpur village, dillisantoshpita kaa naam-rudra bahadurpata-65-je, humayunpur village, dilhihumayunpur gaanv se jude in donon passport kaa pataa bhi galat niklaa
 When Sumitra Malla and Santosh were investigated, people refused to identify the address, including passport photographs

 From Humayumpur village, Aaj Tak team moved towards some other areas of Delhi
 yahaan ke naam pate par passport daftar ne bagaiyr kisi padtaal ke hi passport jari kiye hai

 kaise passport daftar ne bagaiyr police kii jaanch report or local intelegence se padtaal karaae passport jari kiye
 When these questions were kept in the Delhi Regional Passport Office, they got a surprising answer

 At the same time, he called upon the Patidars to oppose this honor ceremony
 saath hi ye bhi kaha ki wo virodh kaa kya tarika apanaayenge iskaa khulaasa abhi nahi karenge
 Hardik objected to this honor ceremony and accused some people of his own society that some businessmen of Patel society have met BJP

 He questioned that when this honor ceremony is held for the Patidars, then why are non-patidars like Amit Shah and Vijay Rupani being respected in it
 hardik ne kaha ki bijepi kii or se mujhe badnaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Simultaneously, efforts are being made to weaken this movement
 patidaar shabd kaa istemaal karne par aitarajhardik ne aapatti jataai ki jab is kaarykram main duusare samaaj ke vidhayak or netaa aa rahe hai
 So why is the word patti being used in it
 yahi nahin patel ne bijepi ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki bijepi patidaar andolan ke baad se patidaaron ke bich nahin ja sakati thi
 Therefore, she is trying to get among the Patels by organizing such programs
 hardik ne is sammaan samaaroh kaa patelon kii ore se kiye jane vaale virodh ko lekar bhi apni pratikriya di
 Hardik made it clear that the protest from the Patidars will continue continuously and this time what is the strategy of protest? There is no need to tell him

 This victory of RJD is special in many ways, because in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP led by Narendra Modi won a big victory in Bihar and now with the coming of Nitish, it was believed that the alliance of BJP and JDU RJD may be overshadowed, but it did not happen and RJD has managed to save its seat
 yahi nahin argedy ne jahanabad or bhabhua vidhansabha upachunaav main bhi bijepi-jadyu gathbandhan ko kadi chunauti di he
 BJP has managed to save Bhabhua Assembly seat
 haalanki jahanabad main bijepi-jadyu gathbandhan ko karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The defeat of the BJP-JDU alliance in Lalu's jail, rjd's sympathy for Bihar by-election has made it clear that Lalu Yadav will not prove weak despite being separated from Nitish

 While expressing support for Lalu, the public has given public opinion in favor of RJD in Araria and Jehanabad
 arriya or jahanabad kii jeet bijepi-jadyu ke liye pachaa paanaa kaaphi mushkil hoga
 muslim-yadav equation fits in Lalu's favor The result of the bye election is a matter of great concern for Nitish Kumar, as the muslim-yadav equation in Lalu's favor fits here
 arriya main jahaan 42 pratishat muslim voter hai, vahiin 10 pratishat yadav hai
 Both these sections are considered to be Lalu's vote bank and the verdict has been in favor of RJD
 nitish ke liye chintaa kii baat ye he ki jab ve pehali pari main endie ke saath the to 2004 or 2009 ke chunaavon main muslimon kaa vot jediu ko miltaa tha, or donon baar nitish kii party ke ummidavaar ko jeet mili thi
 But in the 2014 and now 2018 by-elections, the Muslim voter has lost to Nitish
 or jadyu ke liye ye thik sanket nahin he
 While rjd's Mohammad Taslimuddin received 4,07,978 votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Pradeep Singh of BJP got 2,61,474 votes
 yaheen nahin jediu ke vijay kumaar mandal ko 2,21,769 vot mili
 Not only this, just before the elections, Sukhdev Paswan broke with the BJP and joined the RJD

 Ramdarash Mishra is the author of the book 'raat Sapne Mein', a poetry collection published by Indraprastha publisher
 kabhi kavi dushyant kumaar ne jalte hue van kaa vasant main likhaa tha, ''ab umr kii dhalaan utarate hue mujhe / aati he teri yaad tuje kaise bhul jaaun
 It is only natural that Ramdarash Mishra, the eldest poet, is returning to his previous days in his poems, stories, memoirs and novels
 haal hi main unhone patni saraswati mishra par kendrit upanyaas likhaa to isi saal apane charitra abhinayta divangat putr hemanth mishra par ek upanyaas ke bahaane unhen yaad kiya
 These days, even though they are not taking any story of a big plank, the ghazals sit on the loom of their creation, the poems continue to descend and they get filled with the joy of writing by telling them to the visitors
 raat sapane main haal hi main aayaa unka beesvaan kavita sangrah he
 There was a time, when spring came, it used to come straight into his poems, date-festival and man-manuhar resonated in his songs
 unki ganwai nayika apane priy se yah manuhaar karti thi, baar-baar bansuri bajaao na piya
 Do not call and drink through the waves
 geeton-kavitaaon or kahaniyon se pahachaane gaye ramdarsh mishra ne kab gazalon kaa rukh kiya, pataa hi na chalaa or ab tak ve saikadon aisi gazalen likh chuke hai ki munwwar rana tak unki yaad kar romani ho uthte hai
 In the night, it seems that they no longer go in search of poems, poems come in search of them, flying like butterflies
 ek sadi ko jin ankhon ne nihara he, paaramparikta, aadhuniktaa or uttar aadhuniktaa ke daur ko dekha he, bazaar ko chupchaap gharon or drawing room se lekar ichchhaaon ke anant atrupt bhukhand main vyapte dekha he, un budhi ankhon main ab bhi yuva sapane hai
 Every poem is an account of life seen in the body of their sight and experience
 ve pehali hi kavita main jis pani or aag ke sahakaar kii kaamana karte hai, sahyog ke chand main pratirodhi tatwon ke samras ho jane kii baat karte hai, vahi to hamaari samaanath aasthaa kaa moort rup heru sangachhdadhvan sanvadadhvan sanvomnansi jaantaam
 They consider books as their companions, they live with poetry even while away from the hustle and bustle of the world
 mobile par logon se batiyate hue unhen berang benaam chitthiyaan yaad aati hai or yah bhi ki chitthiyaan kaise ab chalan se baahar ho gai hai, jabaki unheen ke shabdon main, mobile tum akhbaar ho, chitthiyaan kavita hoti thim
 In spite of the simplicity of art and craft in these poems, the answer is the learning of life, the lessons, the stress on people's ambiguity and also the call to hold the hand of a lonely man in the path, keep giving him voice, do not leave alone, So that a group takes a bath with laughter / even the floor / that a caravan is coming towards it / full of life

 yah koi sanyog nahin he ki mafia ne bhupendra kii jaan usee din lee jis din yah swayambhu sadhu maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke saath stage par dikhaa
 The Aam Aadmi Party has demanded arrest of the real culprits

 Till yesterday it was difficult to imagine Team India without Sachin, but now the master blaster is starting to look like a burden on Team India
 ek-do siries main naakaami kii baat hoti, to sachin par sawaal uthaane kii majaal koi nahin karata, lekin pichhali das test pariyon main unke ran banane or out hone kaa andaaj dekhakar ab har koi chutki le rahaa he ki aise kab tak khelenge sachin
 The synergy of the legs, eyes and bat has disappeared
 umr haathon se phisalati ja rahi he or 22 gaj kii pattee par aundhe munh gir gai he wo shoharat, jise sachin tendulkar ne international cricket main 23 saal kii tapasya se hasil kiya he
 Match by match, series by series, Sachin is facing the same question as to how long Team India will carry the burden of Sachin's failures
 duniya unhen cricket kaa bhagwaan kahati he, lekin ab wo sammaan bhi sachin par taana maarane kaa jariya ban gaya he
 Sachin had achieved this right on his own, to play international cricket as long as he wanted
 unka behtareen record or cricket main unka rutaba kisi ko khulkar bolne nahin detaa ki ab unhen apane bhavishya ke bare main sochna chahie, lekin pehle newjiland or ab england ke khilaaf sachin kaa pradarshan dekhakar sunil gavaskar tak ishaara kar rahe hai ki sachin ke liye ritairement plan banane kaa vakt aa chukaa he
 Gavaskar says, 'I think, considering the current form of Sachin, now the selectors will talk to Sachin about their future plans and then take a decision
 ' sachin ke kadradaan rahe gavaskar aisa kyon kah rahe hai, ye baat cricket ke record book main darj ho chuki he
 15 and 8 runs in Perth Test against Australia, 25 and 13 runs in Adelaide Test, 19 runs in Hyderabad Test against New Zealand, 17 and 27 runs in Bangalore Test, 13 runs in Ahmedabad Test against England and now 8 in Mumbai Test And 8 runs
 ye he sachin kaa pichley 6 test match kii das pariyon main batting kaa record
 15
 30 kii ausat se 153 ran unke balle se nikle hai or sabase bada score rahaa he 27 ran
 Sachin's poor performance has made his big supporters face pale
 ganimat he ki unka sammaan bachaane ke liye bisisiai dhaal banakar khadi he
 Surely Sachin deserves a respectful farewell from the cricket field, but if his bat does not go to his honor in the field, then how long will the shield of words save Sachin's honor? desh kii sarvocch adaalat shuukravaar ko is baat par faisla karegi kii bhartiya vaayu sena ke liye france se kharide jane vaale arabon rupe ke rafel vimaan deal kii jaanch kii jaae yaa nahin
 The petitions filed for investigation under the court supervision of the deal to buy this fighter aircraft will be decided

 Public interest litigation was first filed by advocate Manohar Lal Sharma alleging alleged irregularities in the deal
 iske baad, ek anya adhivaktaa vineet dhanda ne yachika daayar kar sheersh adaalat kii nigaraanee main is saude kii jaanch karaane kaa anurodh kiya tha
 a separate petition was filed by advocate Prashant Bhushan along with AAP party MP Sanjay Singh and two former ministers and BJP leaders Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie on the deal
 is yachika main anurodh kiya gaya ki ladaaku vimaanon kii kharid ke saude main kathith aniyamittaaon ke liye sibiai ko praathmiki darj karne kaa nirdesh diya jaae
 The central government had defended the deal to purchase 36 fighter jets from France and opposed the demand to make information related to their price public
 bharat ne kareeb 58,000 karod rupe kii keemat se 36 rafel vimaan kharidne ke liye france ke saath samjhauta kiya he taaki bhartiya vayusena kii maarak kshamta main sudhaar kiya ja sake

 America has given this certificate to Pakistan
 america jaldi hi pakistan ko 53
 a $ 20 million aid package will be provided to support economic growth, community development and counter-terrorism efforts
 yah baat aaj yahaan america rajdoot ne kahi
 US Ambassador to Pakistan Richard Olson told Finance Minister Isaac Dar that the grant will be provided as soon as possible, as the US Congress has approved it
 vitt mantralay ke mutabik, naagarik sahaayta package 'kerri-lugar adhinium 2010' ke tahat diya jayega, jisaki avadhi sitambar 2014 main samaapt ho gai
 Olson said that this amount will be given for energy, action against terrorism, economic growth, community development, education and health sector
 pakistan ke liye america rajdoot richard olson ne is baat kaa khulaasa kiya ki yah praaanpatr pakistan ko naagarik sahaayta ke liye kerri-lugaar vidheyak ke tahat aarthik madad kii ek shart he

 Congress has given its approval to President Obama
 america videsh mantri jon kerri ke is maheene ke ant main islamaad kii yatra par jane se pehle yah praaanpatr jari kiya gaya he
 However, Kerry is also scheduled to visit India before Obama attends the Republic Day celebrations as chief guest
 gandhinagar main 11 janvari se hone vaale 'wibrant gujarat' sammelan main kerri ke shariq hone kaa kaarykram he
 Meanwhile, India received a strong response after Pakistan received a US certificate to rein in terrorism, paving the way for financial aid, saying that its neighbors were not against terrorist organizations, including the lashkar-e-taiba and Al Qaeda Showing continued commitment, nor withholding support being given to them
 iske saath hi unke thikaane bhi nestnabud nahin kiye ja rahe
 However, the State Department said that whatever the US government decides to spend American taxpayers' money, it is its prerogative
 bharat is khabar par tippanee kar rahaa tha ki america ne pakistan ko is aashya kaa praaanpatr diya he ki usne apni sarajameen se alqaida, taliban or isse jude lashkar e taiyaba tathaa jaish e mohammad jaise aatanki sanghathanon ko sanchalit hone se roka
 After the meeting of senior leaders of the party with Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi, a list of issues is ready to surround the government in the monsoon session
 monsoon satr main party ko lagata he ki is baar tamaam aise mudde hai jin par tamaam kshetreey dal bhi sarkaar ke khilaaf khadey honge or sarkaar ko baikfoot par janaa padegaa
 In the search of issues, the Congress has taken special care that it does not cost to fight only for that paragandhi family and the opposition should not be dispersed
 congress un muddon ke saath utregi jo janata se jude hon yaa phir rajya sarkaron ke haq ke hon, jisase wo vipakshi ekta ko majboot kar sake
 This time the Congress has made the top 5 of its issues, through which it will surround the government-1
 arunachal or uttarakhand main centre or rajyapal kii bhoomika:congress is mudde parasarkaar se javabmangegi
 He feels that all political parties will support him on this issue
 yahaan tak kii sarkaar kii sahyogi shivasena ke rukh ke baad to wo khaasi utsahit he
 2
 mahangaai:ye wo mudda he jis sarkaar ke khilaaf aasaani se vipaksh ko lamaband kiya ja saktaa he
 But the role of the Congress is important, that is why on July 20, the party will organize a huge protest at Jantar Mantar on the same issue
 party kii taiyaari upie ke kaarykaal kii aaj kii mahangaai se kii jaae or us vaqt bijepi netaaon ke bayaan yaad dilaae jaaen
 3
 kashmir mudda:jammu kashmir ke halaat chintajanak hai, party is masale ko bhi sansad main uthaaegi or thikra centre or rajya sarkaar par phodegi
 4
 videsh niti:haal main kashmir par pakistan kaa badbolapan, enesji kaa maamla or china kaa ravaiya, is sabko milakar sarkaar ko uski videsh niti par gheraa jayega
 5
 centre or rajya kaa mudda:haal mencendre or rajya ke bichhui baithak ke baad mamata, kejariwal or akaliyon ke rukh se congress ko bal mila he
 She wants the regional parties to criticize the Centre's stand and that she should be the leader and confront the government with opposition unity on this issue
 vipakshi dalon ke netaaon se sampark main congressin muddon par congress jediu, ensipi, argedy, left sareekhee tamaam partiyon se sampark banaae hue he
 He is cautious about BSP and SP in terms of UP elections
 GST bill par baikfoot par congresis bill par tamaam dalon ke hami bharne ke baad congress jarur baikfoot par he
 There is a dispute between the government and the party to put the cap on constitutional amendment at 18 per cent
 haalanki, sutron ke mutabik, party ne is par lacheela rukh apanaate hue isko ab samvidhan sanshodhan main rakhane kii maang par nahin adegi
 The government will seek some legal protection as an alternative to this and will wait for the government's reply
 rosemara ke muddon par bhi nigahenisi bich sansad satr ke dauraan agar koi bada mudda saamne aata he to party usko bhi lapakane main deree nahin karegi
 The Congress will know that the arithmetic in the Lok Sabha is weak
 isaliye uskaa zyada jor rajyasabha main hi rahegaa
 In fact, due to Rajya Sabha, she is delaying her plan to decide UP, because UP in-charge Ghulam Nabi Azad is the Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Raj Babbar, Sanjay Singh, Pramod Tiwari, PL Poonia are also Rajya Sabha mps
 rajyasabha main inaki maujuudagi behad ahm he, isi chakkar main lakhanu main nai team ke padbhaar sanbhaalane ke liye ravivaar kaa din chunaa gaya or agle din somvaar ko sabhi ko sansad main maujuud rahane ko kah diya gaya
 Overall, this monsoon session of Parliament will be ruckus and the opposition will try its best to release the sweat of the government in the rainy season

 isse is vidheyak par aam raay banane or sansad main paarit hone kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 While presenting the Nuclear Liability Bill, 2010 in the House, Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office Prithviraj Chavan said, "this unprecedented bill has been introduced which seeks to build a consensus involving the concerns of all opposition parties
" ’’vidheyak ke mul swaroop main 17 (bi) upbandh main sanshodhan karne kaa prastaav kiya gaya tha jisaki bhaajapa or vam dalon ne kadi aalochana kii thi
 It was said to prove the intention of the supplier in the event of a compensation claim in the event of an accident
 chavaan ne mul vidheyak main nayaa sanshodhan pesh karte hue kaha ki ab 17 (bi) upbandh main ‘iradatan’ shabd nahin he or iske sthaan par ‘aapurtikarta yaa uske karmchaariyon ke kaary ke maddenjar parmaanu durghatana jo ghatiya yaa trutipurna upkaran, saamagree yaa seva ke kaaran hui ho’ ko rakhaa gaya he
 Taking part in the discussion, Jaswant Singh of the BJP proposed some further amendments in clause 17 of the bill which matches the amendments introduced by the government
 makapa ke basudev acharya or bhakpa ke gurudaas dasgupta kii ore se pesh alag alag sanshodhano main bhi yah baat kahi gayi he
 Chavan said 'the purpose of bringing this bill is to protect the interests of' victims' in the event of a nuclear accident
 ’ mantri ne kaha ki 2005 main pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii america yatra ke dauraan is samasya ke nidaan ke liye ek qaraar karne kii ruparekha bani lekin is disha main parmaanu daayitv kanoon na hone se ek kami aa rahi thi kyonki parmaanu urja utpaadan karne vaale 30 deshon main se 28 main aisa kanoon he
 There is no such law only in India and Pakistan
 unhone kaha ‘hamane vidheyak taiyaar karne main sabhi vipakshi dalon, visheshgyon evam sabhi pakshon ke saath vyapak vichaar vimarsh kiya he or is disha main mul vidheyak main 18 sanshodhano ke baad ise pesh kiya gaya he jisamen bhaajapa, vam dalon or sapa jaise dalon ke sujhaavon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Chavan said "left parties still have some concerns but i want to tell them that this is not for the help of any country

 kebisi sijan 11 main avinaash kumaar mahanta ko traasadee bhari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Actually Avinash had answered 10 questions without using any lifeline and was successful in winning Rs 3 lakh 20 thousand

 12 lakh 50 hajaar ke sawaal par unhone flip di queshchan lifline kaa istemaal kiya
 Although his answer on the question of 12 lakh 50 thousand was perfectly fine, but Avinash did not want to take the risk and he flipped the question
 ye sawaal flip hone ke baad avinaash se cricket se judaa sawaal poocha gaya or ve is sawaal par kanphyus najar aae
 The question was, who are the players who scored the first century from India on foreign soil? Despite being fond of cricket, Avinash appeared confused on this question and used an audience poll using another lifeline
 amitabh ne bhi di thi salayeemitabhane unhen chetaya bhi tha ki 12 lakh 50 hajaar ke sawaal kathin hote hai or jaruri nahin ki audiyans kaa anumaan thik hi ho
 However, in spite of this, he used the audience poll and after the audience poll came out that the third option of this question was considered the most, ie 39 percent of the people were right
 avinaash ne bhi audiyans ke saath jane kaa faisla kiya or unhone opshan si yani lala amarnath chunaa
 However, this option proved to be wrong and the correct answer to this question was Syed Mushtaq Ali i

 Option B

 Lalu Yadav had claimed two days ago that the UGC has sent an order from the speed post to the universities to abolish the reservation of obcs on the posts of Professor and Associate Professor
 usase baad lalu yadav ne isko lekar aasmaan sir par uthaa liya
 The UGC denied Lalu's claims that the government was doing all this at the behest of the Sangh and Mohan Bhagwat had already spoken of abolishing reservations
 lalu yadavane kaha ki wo aarakshan khatm karnaa katai bardaasht nahin karenge or iske liye andolan karenge
 When the matter caught fire, the UGC issued an explanation and said that there has been no change in the policies regarding reservation
 bas phir kya tha ujisi ke isi spashtikaran ko aadhaar banaakar lalu ne jeet kaa daawa kar diya or twit karke kaha, 'ye lalu kii nahin desh ke 85 fisadi bahusnkhyakon kii damdaar aawaaj kaa asar he

 UGC Vice Chairman h Devraj said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that there has been no rollback

 h Devraj made it clear that since 2007 there has been no change in reservation in UGC so there is no question of rollback
 2006 bane kanoon ab bhi jarigauratlab he ki college or uniwarsity main shikshakon ke teen pad hote hai
 The earliest assistant professor is first called the lecturer
 uske baad associat professor or phir professor hote hai
 Scheduled Caste people get the benefit of reservation on these three posts and they are still continuing

 Therefore, the decision of Lalu Yadav to rollback the decision of the UGC is not actually done
 mandir main puja ke liye jaaen to andar ghusane se pehle ghanti bajaane kaa niyam he
 The reason is not only religious but also scientific
 bataaya jaataa he ki jab ghanti bajaai jaati he to vaataavaran main kampan paidaa hota he or yah vayumandal ke kaaran kaaphi dur tak jaati he
 The advantage of this vibration is that all the bacteria, viruses and micro-organisms that come in its area are destroyed and the environment is purified
 jaane kya he karthik poornima kaa mahatv
 
 
 That is, the environment of the places where the sound of bells comes regularly is always pure and pure
 isse nakaaratmata dur hone ke saath hi dhanavarsha bhi hoti he
 4 reasons for which the bell should ring: 1
 mana jaataa he ki ghanti bajaane se mandir main sthapit devi-devataaon kii murtiyon main chetana jaagrit hoti he jiske baad unakipuja or aradhanaddhik faldaayak or prabhaavshaalee ban jaati he
 2
 ghanti kii karnpriy dhwani man-mastishk ko aadhyatm bhav kii ore le jane kaa samarthy rakhti he
 The bells are played with a rhythm and special tune whenever there is worship or aarti in the temple in the morning and evening
 isse shanti or divine upasthiti kii anubhuti hoti he
 3
 jab sristi kaa prarambh hua, tab jo naad (aawaaj) gunji thi vahi aawaaj ghanti bajaane par bhi aati he
 The bell is considered a symbol of this sound
 yahi naad'onkaar'ke uccharan se bhi jaagrit hota he
 4
 mandir ke baahar lagi ghanti yaa ghante ko kaal kaa pratik bhi mana gaya he
 Assumptions include ringing the bell to avoid catastrophe
 ye hai bhagwaan vishnu ke 10 prasiddh mandir
 
 
 At the same time, there are not one, but 4 types of bells in temples
 ye hai -1
 Garuda bell: It is a small bell that can be played with one hand
 2
 Door bell: a medium-sized bell that hangs at the door
 3
 Hand bell: The solid of brass is like a round plate, which is pushed by a wooden mattress
 4
 Hour: It is very big and when playing it the sound goes for many kilometers
