 com / 3muxtdseop Following the release of top separatist leader Masrat Alam on the orders of Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Saeed, the BJP has said that this could pose a 'threat' to the ruling coalition
 vahiin, suraksha balon ne bhi is par chintaa jataate hue kaha he ki isse jammu-kashmir kii shanti khatre main pad sakati he
 Ravindra Raina, the head of the youth wing of the state BJP and the party's MLA from Nowshera, said, 'masrat Alam is a threat to national security as he is not a political prisoner but a terrorist
 bijepi uski rihaai kabhi bardaasht nahin karegi
 If such anti-national, pro-pakistan leaders are released, it will be very difficult to run a coalition government
 ' unhone kaha, 'yah gathbandhan khatre main padegaa kyonki ham ise kabhi sweekaar nahin karenge
 'we will oppose the release of the anti-india leader
 ' raina ne kaha ki rashtradrohi netaaon kii rihaai us nunatam saajha kaarykram (siempi) kaa ulanghan he jisapar gathbandhan sarkaar banane ko lekar sahmati bani thi
 Describing Alam's release as a 'major threat' to national security, Raina said that this could increase terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha, 'alam aatankwaadiyon se bhi zyada khatarnaak he
 BJP will oppose this and we will definitely talk to the central government on this issue
 'alam kii rihaai suraksha ke liye khatra: suraksha balsuraksha balon ne bhi alam kii rihaai se jammu-kashmir kii suraksha ko khatra bataaya he
 a senior police officer said, "this will be a big threat to security
" jammu-kashmir, khaskar kashmir ghati, kii shanti ke liye yah bada jokhim hoga jahaan alam ne patharbaji se las do bade pradarshan karaae or jisamen kai logon kii jaane gayi
 The official said that he is a more powerful leader than Syed Ali Shah Geelani and has a large army of stone-pelts and youth
 bhashaa se input There is a strong connection between cinema and festivals
 bollywood main aksar bade binar apni filmon ke liye tyoharon ko chunate hai or aise main sabase rangila tyohaar he holi
 In colorful festivals like Holi, Bollywood songs add fun
 chaahe holi se lagbhag ek maheene pehle relies hui akshay kumaar kii film 'jolly elelbi 2' kaa gaanaa 'go pagal' ho, yaa phir holi se thik 2 din pehle relies hui varun dhawan or aalia bhatti kii film 'badrinaath kii dulhaniya' ho, holi kaa rangila rang in donon hi filmon main saal kii shuruyaat main hi chadha diya he
 But whenever it comes to the songs of Holi, it automatically hits songs like Amitabh Bachchan's 'rang Barse Bhige Chunariya', and the film Sholay's 'holi Ke Din Dil Milte Hain'
 ham aapke saamne kuch aise hi gaanon kii list de rahe hai jinhen aap is baar holi par apni plalist main jarur bajaaenge
 The song 'go Pagal' from the film 'jolly LLB 2'
 'badrinaath kii dulhaniya' kuch is rang main dikhi sarabor
 Holi color is incomplete without Amitabh Bachchan's song 'rang Barse'
 saalon baad bhi amitabh bachchan or hema malini kaa 'hori khelen raghubira' aapaki list kaa hissaa jarur hona chahie
 Dancing on this song of the film 'kati Patang' is not necessary
 haalanki ranbir kapur kaa kahana he ki unhen holi zyada pasand nahin he lekin film 'ye javaani he divaani' main ranbir or deepika padukon kii 'balam pichakaari' main masti aapako is baat kaa ehsaas nahin hone degaa
 The song 'mere Brother Ki Dulhania' is a song filmed on Yun To Dhaba, but the fun of this song will remind you of Holi itself
 dar film kaa yah gaanaa, 'ang se ang lagaana' jaise holi par bajnaa to jaruri he
 And finally, on the song 'jogi ji slowly' from the old film 'nadia Ke Paar', no matter how tired you are, you will not be able to stop without your snort
 film 'sholay' kaa vah dialog to aapako yaad hi hoga, 'holi kab he, kab he holi
 
 
 'so this song of Holi is made to be heard on this Holi
 tippaniyan So dance with these songs in fun filled colors, sing and celebrate the festival of Holi
 film 'jolly elelbi 2' kaa gaanaa 'go pagal'
 'badrinath Ki Dulhaniya' looked dull in this color
 amitabh bachchan ke gane 'rang barase' ke bina holi kaa rang adhuraa he
 Even after years, Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini's 'hori Khel Raghubira' must be a part of your list
 film 'kati patang' kaa yah gaanaa 'aaj na chodenge' par naachna to jaruri he
 Although Ranbir Kapoor says that he does not like Holi much, but the fun in Ranbir and Deepika Padukone's 'balam Pichkari' in the film 'yeh Jawani Hai Divani' will not let you realize this
 'mere brother kii dulhaniya' kaa gaanaa yun to dhabas par filmaaya gaya ek gaanaa he lekin is gane kii masti aapako holi kii hi yaad dilaaegaa
 This song from the film Der, like 'ang Se Ang Ang Lagana' is a must to play on Holi
 or aakhir main puraani film 'nadiya ke paar' kaa gaanaa 'jogi ji dhire-dhire' par chaahe aap kitna bhi thak jaaen, aapke thirake bina nahin ruk paaenge

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni took the responsibility of a three-run close defeat against England in the only T20 International cricket match and said that he failed to finish the game in the last over
 bharat ke saamne 181 ran kaa lakshya tha, lekin vah viraat kohli ke england daure main pehle ardhashatak ke baavjood paanch wicket par 177 ran hi bana paaya
 Dhoni said, it is always difficult to score 17 runs off six balls
 maine pehali gend par chaukaa lagaaya
 In the final over, i missed at least two such shots on which i could hit the boundary
 yah mushkil kaam tha or yah un dinon main se tha jab chijen aapke paksh main nahin jaati
 At the other end was Ambati Rayudu, but the Indian captain decided to take responsibility on his own and did not take a single run in the middle
 unhone kaha, mujhe laga ki gend mere balle ke bich main aa rahi he isliye mujhe jimmedaari uthaani chahie, lekin aisa nahin hua
 Rayudu came at the same time as the balls he played, he could not play the shot from the middle of the bat, so i thought i would have to take responsibility
 dhoni ne kaha, maine over ke shuru main hi faisla kar liya tha ki main isko finnish karne kii koshish karuunga
 It is important to encourage yourself
 rayudu bhi aisa kar saktaa tha, lekin yah meri takat he or iske liye main jimmedaari letaa hum
 The Indian bowlers again failed to curb the runs in the death overs, and instead of yorking, they did a low full-toss
 dhoni ne mana ki yah chintaa kaa vishay he
 "yarker is still a concern, but after the difference in format, it has become difficult," he said
 hamaare paas aaj teen spinner the isliye gend ne zyada ragad nahin khai thi or aise main deth overon main gendbaaji karnaa aasaan nahin hota
 But when you don't do the right yorker, the batsmen could be tricked
 aapako apni line or length badalane kii jarurat padati he, lekin hamaare gendbaajon ne aaj sudhaar nahin kiya
 India lost the Test series 1-3, but managed to win 3–1 in the ODI series
 do maheene ke puure daure ke bare main dhoni ne kaha, hamaare saath is daure par kai yuva khilaadi the
 The five-test series is a series of links
 isse pehle hamaare kisi khilaadi ne paanch test maichon kii shrunkhlaa nahin kheli thi
 We did well in the first two matches, but we could not play well in the last three matches
 iske baad vanade main acha pradarshan karnaa mahatvapurn tha or hamane aisa kiya
 He said, 20 in between visits
 25 din tak ham acchhee cricket nahin khel paae
 This would happen with every team
 yahaan ke anubhav se sikh lenaa mahatvapurn he
 After that we have to play from the West Indies and Australia and if we can apply the learning here and then i will be happy

 The government has given another opportunity to over 1500 Non CTET Guest Teachers who have been expelled from the government schools of Delhi on 1 July 2019
 ol india guest teachers association ne unhen waapas schoolo main jwining ko lekar dilli sarkaar or saansad manoj tiwari ko dhanyavad diya he jinke prayaason kii vajah se Non CTET guest teachers ko ek baar phir se rojgaar mil gaya he
 Shoaib Rana, a member of the All India Guest Teachers Association, said that for a long time the organization had been demanding a 60-year policy
 saath hi Non CTET guest teachers ko kam se kam do baar sitate karne kaa mauka diya jane ko sangharshrat tha
 Let us know that about 22 thousand guest teachers were teaching in Delhi government schools
 11 farvari 2019 ko shiksha vibhaag ne circular jari karke kaha tha ki is satr (2018-19) ke baad dilli ke sarkari skulon main padhaa rahe atithi shikshak CTET (central Teachers Eligibility Test) pariksha paas karne ke baad hi skulon main padhaa sakenge
 The association had demanded from the government and LG (deputy Governor) that guest teachers be given a chance at least twice
 lekin, unhen ye mauka nahin diya gaya tha or 1 july 2019 ko lagbhag 1500 Non CTET guest teachers ke naam shiksha vibhaag ke online modul se hataa die gaye the us dauraan sitate main fail hone ke baad kareeb 1500 guest teachers ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya tha
 These 1500 teachers became unemployed
 shoeb rana kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ke is kadam ke liye sabhi atithi shikshak shiksha mantri, saansad manoj tiwari or LG sahab ke abhaari hai
 In view of the future of students and employment of guest teachers, they have extended their deadline to 31 / 10 / 2019, allowing non Ctet guest teachers to pass Ctet
 bataa den, badi sankhya main Non Ctet guest teachers ne 7 july 2019 ko hone vaali CTET kii pariksha paas bhi kar lee he
 Now they are waiting for their joining that a mail has been put in the schools for joining the non CTET or CTET pass guest teachers in the district and joining
 lekin, kai district ke skulon main abhi bhi NON CTET guest teachers kii jwining ke liye mail dwaara dishanirdesh nahi die gaye hai
 Due to this, the guest teachers of those schools are not able to join because the head of the schools clearly says that they are unable to join anyone until there are no guidelines in their school from the Department of Education
 is
 kuch guest teachers abhi bhi CTET kii pariksha paas nahi kar paae hai jinke liye CTET paas karne kaa shiksha vibhaag ne 31 / 10 / 2019 tak kaa samay diya he
 The organization has requested the Education Department that the names of NON ctet guest teachers should be put in the online module as soon as possible so that their joining can be done as soon as possible
 saath hi nivedan he ki NON CTET guest teachers ko CTET paas karne kii chhot aagaamee CTET kii pariksha hone tak or badha di jaae kyonki 31 / 10 / 2019 tak CTET kii pariksha kaa aayojan prastaavit nahi he
 Most users of India use pirated Ms Word
 agar aap bhi unamem se ek hai to aapako saavdhaan ho zarurat he
 Because researchers have found security flaws in Microsoft Office, which the company has also accepted
 iske jariye bheje gaye mailaware yugers ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Although it is not direct, you may have problems with the word file sent by the sender
 security riserchars kaa maananaa he ki is bag se microsoft ke productivity suut se generat kiye gaye main problem ho sakati he
 That is, all versions of Word can be affected by it
 isamen Windows 10 ke liye diya jane vaala Office 2016 bhi shaamil he
 Significantly, built-in systems are provided to prevent dangerous files in Microsoft Office and Windows operating systems
 lekin is atake ke dauraan havers un security ko bhi bhedane main kaamyaab ho sakate hai
 Security firm Proofpoint has investigated this and found that the malware starts working as soon as the user opens the word file
 yani yujar jaise hi padhane ke liye bheji gai verde file ko kholegaa uskaa computer infect ho saktaa he
 Researchers at mcafee first discovered this flaw
 haalanki fireeye ke expartska maananaa he ki unhen is baat kii jaankaree thi, lekin unhen pehle microsoft ko isaki jaankaree deni jaij samajhi
 Fire Eye stated in its blog post, 'this attack includes emails in which word documents are attached
 torget yujar ko bhejkar ise trigar kiya jaataa he’jaise hi yujar atech kiye gaye verde document ko kholta he vaise hi Windows
 exe sends HTTP request to remote server
 request milte hi sarwar 
 hta sends a file which is a fake rich text format, but to the users it looks exactly the same as real
 dhokhe se yugers ise clic karne par majaboor ho jate hai
 However, it has been done before that through email attachments, hackers target a computer
 lekin aamtaur par verde file ko sef mana jaataa he
 So the security flaw found this time is certainly nothing short of a warning bell
 saadhaaran shabdon main ise samajhen to sender email ke jariye infectedward file bhejkar aapkesystem main mailaware inject kar saktaa he
 Although such cases have happened before, people usually open the Word file with confidence
 microsoft ke pravaktaa ne is khami ko mana he or kaha he ki ise manthali security ptch ke jariye fiks kar liya jayega
 On its second day, the company claims to have fixed it with new updates
 hamaari salaah he ki anjaane email se bheje gaye verde file ko downlod na karen

 For five days, there have been many big incidents of loot only
 chinahat, hindola, kakori or malihabad main lut kii ghatnaayen hui hai
 The devastation caused by the massive fire in the country's only All India Institute of Medical Sciences, AIIMS and Delhi, could have been prevented to a great extent
 zarurat thi to sirf isaki ki, aspataal prashasan or parisar main chappe-chappe par faile privet security agency ke guards alert hote! dilli damakal vibhaag ke karmchaaree to puri takat jhonkne par amada the, magar unhen yah sab kar guzarane kaa mauka talashne main hi kaaphi vakt barbaad ho gaya
 Talking to IANS, Delhi Fire Service Director Vipin Cantal on Sunday endorsed several of these points
 aag kii shuruyaat kab hui is sawaal kaa makul jabaab ames prashasan main abhi tak kisi ke paas nahin he
 Except to indicate the possibility that the fire may have been caused by the short circuit! Vipin Cantal told IANS that the fire was reported to the Delhi Fire Control Room around 5:30 PM
 soochna milte hi tatkaal 15 fire tender (aag bujhane kii gaadi) maukey par ravaanaa kar diye gayi
 The fire was completely brought under control around 11
30 pm
 jabaki pisi block kii paanch manjila imaarat (jisamen aag lagi) main faile dhune or halki phulki sulag rahi aag ko ravivaar subah kareeb saat baje puri tarah shant kiya ja sakaa
 AIIMS sources say that due to this fire, all the telephone land lines in the hospital premises have also stopped working, due to which there is a lot of trouble
 dilli damakal seva ke nideshak vipin cantal ne ieenes se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki, aag ko kaabo karne ke liye kul 34 fire tender lagane pade
 Cantal said, 'on arriving at AIIMS, we had guessed that the fire broke out from the second floor of the PC block
 isi manzil par prayogshaala he
 There is also an ICU here
 jisamen kai marij ventilator par gambhir haalat main the
 First get them out
 uske baad or bhi tamaam marijon ko sabase pehle bachaana dilli damakal kii praathamikta main rahaa
 We also got success in this, but after much effort
 'aag bujhane main kya kuch khaas kathinaayeeyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa, yah poochne par cantal bole, 'pisi building ke peeche kii said main (jisaki second floor par aag kii shuruyaat hui) bhu-tal par aspataal prashasan ne kuch baari-bharkam ucch kshamta vaale janarator set sthapit kar rakhe hai
 Delhi Fire employees had to place their highrise platforms here to reach the place where the fire started
 lekin ve aisa nahin kar sake, agar usee jagah par hirise platforms vakt rahete lag gayi hote to ham aag ko shaayad anya manjilon par pahunchane se roak sakate the
 In compulsion, we had to take highrise platforms in front of the affected building
 joki zarurat ke hisaab vaali jagah se kaaphi dur the
 According to IANS sources, it is still believed that the fire is from the short circuit
 jabaki duusari ore aspataal kii band prayogshaala main aag lagane ke kaarnon ke bare main puche jane par dilli damakal seva nideshak vipin cantal ne kaha ki, "yah jaanch kaa vishay he
 Short circuits can be a cause or cause of fire
 magar short circuit hi aag kii vajah thi, yah majboot tareeke se kahana thik nahin hoga
 "he argues that 'the fire started in the closed laboratory of the institute
 shanivaar kaa din avkaash kaa din tha
 In such a situation, it is not appropriate to say that the fire short circuit inside the closed laboratory is present
 kyonki aag kii pehali chingaari band lab ke andar kisi ne uthati dekhi hi nahin he
 Sources at IANS do not currently put a full stop on the possibility of fire from any flammable material in a closed lab
 dilli damakal seva nideshak vipin cantal is baat ko baar-baar doharaate hai ki, 'aspataal prashasan ne agar agni se prabhavit hui paanch manjila imaarat ke pichley hisse ke bhu-tal ko baari-bharkam janaretaron se na gheraa hota to dilli damakal seva har haal main aag paanch manjila tak nahin pahunchane detii
 'according to him there were no casualties in the fire
 nuksaan ke bare main poochne par cantal ne kaha, paanch manjila imaarat main kareeb paanch kamaron ko aag ne chapet main liya
 The loss of records and valuable machinery was definitely very high
 nuksaan kii keemat or record khaak hone kaa aankada ames or police kii jaanch ke baad hi sahi-sahi pataa chal paayegaa

 Looking at the political developments before it, it has been seen that Rahul Gandhi does not share the stage or meeting with Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, but reached Sharad Pawar's house for a meeting at the behest of opposition leaders
 aap-congress gathbandhan ko lekar bada pench bhi he ki kya gathbandhan sirf dilli main yaa punjab or haryana main bhi?isse pehle congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne buudhvaar ko rakanpa adhyaksh sharad pavaar se yahaan mulaakaat kii

 1 maheene pehle tak sarfaraj alam jediu se vidhayak the
 But Sarfaraz Alam had already realized that there is a lot of anger against Nitish Kumar among the Muslims of Araria, it would not be wrong to say so and to take full advantage of this anger, he left his party and joined the RJD

 Born on July 7, 1981, Dhoni married Sakshi in a mountainous manner with Sakshi in Dehradun three days before his 29th birthday but he would not be able to spend a holiday with his life partner as the Indian team headed by him would soon visit Sri Lanka where he It is to participate in a three-test series from July 18
 bharat ko apni captaini main kai aitihaasik jeet dilaane vaale dhoni ke liye yah bahut mushkil chunauti hogi kyonki bhartiya team ne srilankai sarajameen par 1993 se koi test shrinkhalaa nahin jiti he jabaki is bich use pichhali teen shrinkhalaaon main se do main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Under Dhoni's leadership, India won the Asia Cup after 15 years by defeating Sri Lanka on their soil last month
 bhartiya team kaa yah srilanka kaa chatha daura he lekin dhoni test shrinkhalaa khilne ke liye pehali baar is padosi desh main jaaenge 
 Dhoni took a break when India went on a tour of Sri Lanka to play a three-match series in 2008
 mohammad ajaharuddin jab 1995 main team lekar srilanka gayi to tab bharat ne colombo main 27 july se ek agast tak khelaa gaya doosraa test match 235 ran se jitkar teen match kii shrinkhalaa 1-0 se apane naam kii thi
 It was the same match in which Sachin Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 104 in the second innings while his boycott Vinod Kambli scored 125 runs in the first innings
 bhartiya team ne iske baad srilanka main do test match jarur jite lekin vah kabhi shrinkhalaa apane naam nahin kar paaya
 When India went on a Sri Lankan tour in 1997, both the Test matches did not yield results, while in the 2001 tour, they suffered a 1-2 defeat in a three-match series
 iske saat saal baad 2008 kii shrinkhalaa kaa parinaam bhi yahi rahaa
 Ajanta Mendis then entangled the Indian batsmen in the trap of his mysterious balls and won his team 2–1
 ab sabhi ko dhoni se karishme kii ummid he jinhen srilanka main pehali baar test match khelnaa he
 By the way, Sri Lankan soil is not new to them
 unhone ab tak 23 ekadivasiy match srilanka main khele hai jinaki 22 pariyon main 50
 Has scored 803 runs at an excellent average of 18

 JDU has started projecting the face of Nitish Kumar, who holds the power of the state, for 2020
 aise main sahyogi bijepi se nitish ke khilaaf awaajen uth rahi hai to argedy unhen dobaaraa se mahagathbandhan main vaapasi kaa nyauta dene lagi he
 nda's third ally LJP is seen standing openly with Nitish Kumar
 bihar main nitish kumaar kii branding ke khilaaf bijepi ke netaa sanjay paswan khadey hue or unhone kaha ki bijepi ne jadyu ko or nitish kumaar ko 15 saal satta main rahane kaa mauka diya he
 So now he should give this opportunity to BJP as well
 itnaa hi nahin sanjay paswan ne kaha ki ab bihar ko nitish model kii nahin balki modi model kii jarurat he
 After Paswan's statement, BJP leader and Bihar deputy CM Sushil Modi had to come forward in view of the deteriorating relationship with JDU
 unhone twit kar kaha tha ki nitish kumaar bihar main endie ke captain hai or unheen kii captaini main agle saal vidhansabha chunaav ladenge
 There is no crisis regarding leadership in NDA
 bhale hi susheel modi damege control karne kii koshish kar rahe hon par yah sach he ki bijepi ke ek bade varg kaa yah maananaa he ki bihar main party ke udai kaa sahi vakt aa chukaa he
 BJP leaders feel that BJP got 23 per cent of the votes in the Lok Sabha elections and also the maximum number of seats
 aise main party ke liye satta main kabiz hone kii sambhaavnaaen prabal ho rahi hai
 Another major reason for the enthusiasm of BJP leaders is the weakening of Lalu's position and BJP is continuously engaged in helping Yadav voters
 lagata he isi baat ko samajhate hue susheel modi ne nitish ke paksh main likhe gaye apane twit ko 15 minute ke andar hi delit kar diya
 In Bihar, Nitish Kumar's JDU and BJP are constantly trying to stand against each other to measure their political fold
 isiilie lagaataar donon taraf se koshishon kii ja rahi hai
 However, both the BJP and Nitish Kumar have become aware of each other's political strength by fighting separately in the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2015 Assembly elections
 aise main bijepi or jediu is baat ko bakhubi samajhate hai ki bihar main donon ek duusare kii majaburi bhi hai or jaruri bhi
 RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh admitted that he was welcome if Nitish Kumar returned to the grand alliance to defeat the BJP
 isse pehle argedy ke varisht netaa shivanand tiwari ne nitish kumaar ko nyotaa diya tha or kaha tha ki nitish kumaar mahagathbandhan main aaen or vah pradhanmantri material hai
 In such a situation, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh's statement matters more to Nitish Kumar than Sushil Modi and Ram Vilas Paswan
 darasal nitish kumaar pehle jab mahagathbandhan ke netaa the to raghuvansh prasad tab har baat par aalochana karne se parhez nahin karte the
 It was believed that even though the voice was his and the thinking was behind RJD supremo Lalu Yadav
 aise main ab shivanand or raghuvansh ke bolne kaa ek hi arth he ki yah lalu yadav ke bina sahmati ke nahin bol rahe hai
 Senior journalist Himanshu Mishra said that since the Lok Sabha elections, Lalu Yadav has not relied on the ability and ability of his son Tejashwi Yadav in the current political situation
 haalanki argedy kaa 80 fisadi votbank anti bijepi he, lekin loksabhaa chunaav ke baad yadav vot ko bijepi apane paale main laane kii kavayad kar rahi he
 Whereas Nitish Kumar is eyeing Muslim votes
 lekin is baavjood nitish kumaar or bijepi kaa saath philhal nahin chhodane vaale hai, kyonki inke donon ke alag hote hi argedy badi takat banakar ubhar sakati he

 Murugadoss Artist: Akshay Kumar, Sonakshi Sinha, Sumit Raghavan and Freddy Daruwalla
 Akshay Kumar does three to four films a year and is looking to return to the golden phase once again
 unki pichhali filmein bos or vans apon a time in mumbai dobaaraa box offis par jalawaa nahin dikhaa saki thim
 This time they are on the test of the audience with plenty of action
 gazani fame diarector e
 R
 murugados kii yah film he
 He has tried to tie the film in plenty
 akshay ke behtareen acshan najar aate hai or acchhee acting bhi
 The story is a little difficult to guess
 film kii lambaai thodaa pareshaan jarur karti he
 But its action definitely makes it worth a look
 kahani main kitna damcaptain viraat bakshi (akshay) mumbai aata he or apni bhavi dulhaniya sahiba (sonakshi) se miltaa he
 The story goes on
 is bich aatank kii paraten khulti hai or slipper cell kaa maamla saamne aata he
 Then begins the familiar war between terrorists and patriots
 beshak kahani kuch kamiyon ke saath aage badhati he lekin film kaa acshan seat par baandhe rakhane kaa kaam karata he
 Running behind the terrorists on the streets of Mumbai and many other amazing acts are great
 film kii editing thodi tite kar di hoti to majaa aa jaataa
 It takes about three hours too much
 gambhir acshan hero film main romance farmaate hue kahani ke jaayke ko bigaadane kaa kaam karata he
 The same thing gets stuck
 star apilaise puri tarah se akshay kumaar kii film kaha ja saktaa he kyonki shuru se aakhir tak akki hi chhaae rahete hai
 In the film, he speaks in a very simple way
 bos kii tarah challebaaj dialog to katai nahin
 Hence, fewer seats are heard in the hall on dialogue and more on action
 sonakshi sinha ke liye kuch karne ke liye he nahin
 They only come to lighten the songs and some atmosphere
 shaayad yah baat thodi khalati he
 Freddy also could not leave a special impression as a villain
 kamai kii batfilm kaa bajet 60 karod ru
 Being told aise main ise majboot opening se hi bade bijness kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 It is a remake of the 2012 Tamil film Tupakki
 tamil main bhi murugados ne banaai thi or bahut badi hit rahi thi
 The film is an imitation of hu-bu-boo Tupki but not the same
 akki ko ab thodaa rimex ko lekar sochakar kadam badhaane chahie
 Overall, the film will not disappoint Action fans and Akshay's fans

 There was a fierce debate between Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala and the country's defense minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Panchayat Aaj Takat program of 'aaj Tak' about this model of development
 vikaas ke pagal hone ko lekar apane netaa rahul gandhi ke bayaan kaa bachaav karte hue surajevaala ne kaha ki hamen jumalon se aage badhkar ab jimmedaari tay kerani hogi

 unhone kaha ki jab gujarat main patel samudaae ke logon par 12 hajaar mukademe darj honge or police ghar main ghuskar mahilaon-bujurgon par danda barasaayegi to vikaas pagalaa hi jayega
 Congress spokespersons did not stop here, Surjewala also offered more examples of development going crazy
 unhone kaha ki jab una main dalit saathiyon kii chamadi udhed di jaaegi to vikaas pagalaayegaa hi
 He said that the youth of the state will be hired on temporary jobs and if full salary is not given, then development will be crazy
 yuvaaon ro naukari nahin milegi or wo idhar-udhar bhatakegaa to vikaas pagalaayegaa hi

 Parsekar's decision to contest as a BJP candidate shocked his family and village

 Regarding this, Parsekar said, 'I almost packed my bag and left the house because my family did not understand that i am contesting against Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) candidate Ramakant Khalap
 yah varsh 1988 kii baat he jab bhaajapa ke bare main logon ko bamushkil hi kuch pataa tha

 ' parsekar kii kismat ne 1999 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi unka saath nahin diya, lekin tab tak bhaajapa is tateey rajya main ek takat ban chuki thi
 Goa was in discussion for its political instability and the government often collapsed due to defection
 unhone kaha, 'mere liye tasalli kii baat bas itani thi ki main jamaanat bachaane main kaamyaab rahaa
 'but these tremors did not stall his footsteps and he again contested the assembly elections in 2002 and won by defeating mgp's Khalap, considered invincible, by 750 votes
 tab se unhone peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 In 2007, he doubled his winning margin
 varsh 2012 main jab bhaajapa ne vidhansabha kii 40 main se 21 siten jeet leen tab parsekar phir nirvaachit hue
 It was a historic election, after a long time the party got a clear majority in the assembly and hoped for political stability in the state

 With the help of a friend, he got land near the Western Ghats in the mountain range of Brahmagiri
 is jameen ko kharidne ke liye unhone hawaii main sthit apni jameen bech di or yahaan aa gaye
 But soon they understood that as long as other people near their land used to use pesticide, their work of taking care of the forest and grooming it would not be completed
 jaanwaron ko shikariyon se bachaane ke liye forest vibhaag se bhi lee madad:unhone iske baad jharne ke aas-paas vaali jameen bhi kharidni shuru kar di
 Most of the farmers in this region were not able to produce good yields from these parts of the land
 unhen iske badale jab acchhee rakam milane lagi to unhone jameen bechnaa sweekaar kar liya
 On this wild ground, he started planting all kinds of trees

 In this work, people of many trusts also started helping

 raghuvansh prasad yun to hameshaa nitish kumaar ke khilaaf bayaan dete hai, lekin is baar manch par apane rashtriya adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ko jagah naa milane se vichlit dikh rahe the
 He said that Nitish Kumar is ignoring the alliance and there is resentment among the people
 varisht argedy netaa ne kaha ki bihar main mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar he, vyavastha mahagathbandhan sarkaar kii he, aise main keval nitish kumaar ko credit kyon diya ja rahaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and Bihar Governor besides two Union Ministers Ram Vilas Paswan and Ravi Shankar Prasad were also present on the dais during the main function of Prakash Parv
 vahiin argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav apane donon bete upmukhyamantri tejasvi or swasthya mantri tejpratap yadav ke saath samaaroh main to aae, lekin unhen manch par jagah nahin mili
 Lalu remained seated like a spectator instead of sitting for vips at the ceremony
 unke saath vahaan bihar ke kuch mantriyon ke alaava patna sahib se saasand shatrughna sinha, punjab ke upmukhyamantri sukhbir singh badal, kendriya mantri harsimrat cor bhi baithi thim
 Here Chief Minister Nitish Kumar named RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav in his address, but the Prime Minister did not even name him
 shatrughna sinha kaa kahin koi zikr nahin hua, jabaki vah patna sahib ke saansad hai or unheen ke sansadeey kshetra main yah bhavy aayojan ho rahaa tha
 In such a situation, former Union Rural Development Minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh got an opportunity and took out his anger on Nitish Kumar
 darasal manch par koun-koun baithenge, iske liye protocol tay hota he or usee niyam ke tahat intjaam kiya gaya tha
 But provoking Raghuvansh Prasad Singh even said that Nitish Kumar supported demonetisation, so the Prime Minister has supported liquor ban
 haalanki raghuvansh babu ne ant main yah bhi kaha ki lalu prasad yadav ko neeche baithaana aam logon ne pasand nahin kiya, lekin isse kya hota he vah karodon logon ke dil main basate hai

 Kuldeep's wrist action is tricky and it is very difficult to detect after missing the ball
 root ne unki kalai ke pojishan ko jaldi bhaanp liya or khilne main kaamyaab rahe
 "since the pitch will be dry due to the sun, the spinners will prove useful when asked if this is a bad sign for the Indian team," Tendulkar said, "I don't think other England batsmen are able to play Kuldeep so well
" england main is samay dhoop he, isse pich sukhi hogi
 In such a situation, Kuldeep and the rest of the spinners will prove to be very useful
 ’unhone kaha, 'pich isi tarah sapaat or sukhi rahi, to bharat ke liye acha mauka he
 England's fast bowlers will dominate when the pitch is green
 ’ unhone sweekaar kiya ki pehle teen test main bhubaneshwar kumaar or pehle match main jasprit bumraah kii kami bharat ko khalegi
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar's injury to India, Tendulkar said, 'bhuvi's injury is a shock to India

 He could play the lower order partnerships

 He said, 'virat's 2014 performance has nothing to do with that series
 yadi aap mujhase puuchhen ki kya mujhe viraat se achche pradarshan kii ummid he, to meraa jawaab hoga ki sirf viraat hi kyon, mujhe puri team se achche pradarshan kii ummid he

 aisa ek tivi report main bataaya gaya he

 'dusht' britain or bade shaitan america par vishwaas karnaa ek badi galati hogi
 He said, 'we will not cooperate with the United States on regional issues
 unke lakshya hamase ekadam vipareet hai
 ' gauratlab he ki khumaini iran ke sabase shaktishaalee vyakti hai
 He also said that the US was not committed to the nuclear deal that Tehran had done in 2015 with six major forces
 samjhauta iran ke vivaadit newclear kaarykram ko rokane ke liye hua tha
 Significantly, Khomeini is the most powerful person in Iran

 'it is believed that oil companies can reduce the price of petrol during the Gujarat and Himachal assembly elections
 haalanki, daam ghataane ke samay ke bare main companiyaan philhal kuch bhi kehane se batch raheen hai
 Oil companies are benefiting on petrol but heavy losses on diesel, cooking gas cylinders and kerosene
 isse pehle, petrol kii keemat 24 july ko sanshodhit kii gayi thi
 At that time it was increased by 70 paise making it 68 in Delhi

 Companies are expected to benefit more from this situation

 All these developments have benefited the oil companies on the sale of petrol, although the companies have already incurred a loss of Rs 6,000 crore by selling petrol at a lower price than before

 The Aam Aadmi Party received more good news after Delhi came to power
 lekin buudhvaar ko siyasat ke kai kadave ghunt unhen ek saath pine pade
 It was a very bad day for a year old party
 laksminagar se vidhayak vinod kumaar binni kii baghawat se subah shuru hui
 In the afternoon, it was not until Kejriwal was called a 'liar'
 phir amethi main or uttarakhand main party netaaon ko virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The party was thinking of Damage Control Measures that opposition within the party arose on the issue of FDI
 buudhvaar ko jo kuch bhi hua, vah buudhvaar ko hi khatm nahin ho gaya
 The stalemate born from here can prove to be a sore throat for the party and the government
 phir binni kii press conference bhi abhi baaki he
 Binny again put up a hurdle, will hold a press conference tomorrow
 AAP MLA from Laxminagar Vinod Kumar Binny rebelled against the party leadership once again for being angry over not getting the post of minister
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki party kii kathani-kerani main fark aa gaya he or ab vah un muddon se bhatak gai he jiske dam par use satta mili
 He claimed to open some secrets in this regard by holding a press conference on Wednesday
 jab dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se is babat poocha gaya to pehali baar binni ko mahatvakankshi bataate hue unhone kaha, 'binni pichhali baar mantri pad chaahate the, ab loksabhaa kaa tikat chaahate hai
 Binny was badly hurt by Kejriwal's statement
 bole, 'agar kejariwal ne aisa kaha he to yah ghinauna bayaan he
 While denying that he wanted a Lok Sabha ticket, he even told Kejriwal to be a 'liar'
 haalanki sutron ke mutabik, binni purvi dilli se loksabhaa tikat chaahate the
 While currently in the race, former TV journalist Ashutosh who recently joined the party is ahead
 khabar he ki binni isi baat se bhannaae hue hai
 Ticket pre-decided, then why the forms are being filled: Tina Sharma, who left BJP after Tina Sharmaparty's second rebellion, came to AAP
 unhone apni hi party par satta ke liye kaam karne kaa aarope laga diya
 However, he openly questioned the ticket distribution
 unhone kaha ki party pehle hi dilli kii paanch loksabhaa siton ke liye ummidavaaron ke naam tay kar chuki he or tikat ke liye form bharne kii prakriya mahaj dikhaava he
 Tina Sharma said, 'the names of the candidates for the five Lok Sabha seats in Delhi have been decided
 party ko shajia ilmi, ashutosh kumaar, gopal raay, dilip pandey or ashish talwaar ko tikat degi
 He alleged that the party has not done any work on the 2013 manifesto so far, its focus is only on the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 'amethi main anda, rishikesh main chali kursiyambuudhvaar ko ek baar phir amethi main kumaar vishwaas par anda phenkaa gaya
 Then, during the press conference in Rishikesh, AAP leaders Ashutosh and Sanjay Singh have to face heavy opposition
 press conference ke dauraan hi kursiyaan chalane lageen, jiske baad donon ko bich se hi janaa padaa
 Earlier, party workers clashed with each other to sit on the dais
 sadak par kaise karun faisla, bole kejarivaldilli sachivalay ke baahar shikshak apni maangon ko lekar jamaa hue the
 As soon as CM Kejriwal came out he was surrounded by protesters and started demanding answers
 kejariwal bole, 'sadak par to kaise faisla kar duun
 i have meetings right now
 aapmen se 4-5 log kal milane aaie
 'this statement of Kejriwal, who had once gathered all his political power through street struggle, was a bit startled
 ek sawaal bhi khadaa kiya ki kya vaaki satta paane ke baad kejariwal or unki party badal gai he
 Even in Yogendra's press conference, AAP leader Yogendra Yadav, who was engaged in preparing the party's land in Hungamahariana, also faced opposition
 kurukshetra main unki press conference main jamkar hangaamaa hua
 a person who described himself as the head of the Jat Sabha asked Yogendra to go out, after which the uproar started
 epadiai par party main matbhedam aadmi party din khatm hone kaa intjaar kar rahi hogi ki ek or raajnneetik bam us par fat gaya
 Captain Gopinath, who recently joined the party, opposed the Delhi government's decision on the FDI issue
 retail main epadiai ko manjuuri ke shila sarkaar ke faisle ko haal hi main kejariwal sarkaar ne palat diya he
 Captain Gopinath says that this has sent a wrong message to the investors, so the party should withdraw its decision
 unhone lage haath party ko hadabadi main faisle na lene kii naseehat bhi de daali
