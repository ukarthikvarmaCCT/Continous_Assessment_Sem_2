 Hyderabad, India's second largest city, is without doubt the most active city in the country in terms of sex
 is baat kii pushti 2008 main hue india today-asi nilsan-oarji-maarg sex surveykshan main hui thi
 The city is at the forefront of experimentation with sex and in these cases - most illegal relationships, wife swapping (interchange of wives), sex with prostitutes, acceptance of homosexuality and its prevalence in society, sex toys (sex toys) Experiment), sex relations at an early age, role playing, different postures during coitus, video pornography and making your own porn videos
 hyderabad kii kaamuktha kaa varnan to sexuelity vid rispect tu sex or asian homosexuelity jaisi kitabon main bhi he
 Arrival of sexuality Hyderabad was a thriving city during the rule of Nizam (1724–1948)
 sex kaa us daur main khub anand liya jaataa tha
 Polygamy, alternative sexuality, including homosexual relationships and sexual exploitation of children, was considered common
 hijde haram kii auraton kii raksha ke liye to hote hi the, ve samalingi yon krida main bhi saath dete the
 There is also evidence of the former Nizam's sons stabbing their brother in love with a beautiful eunuch named Rahman
 hyderabad main duusare logon ke aagaman se saamanti or devdasi se judi kaamuktha kaa bhi aagaman hua
 Not surprisingly, many Hyderabadi men continue to be the custodians of prostitutes, participate in the exchange of wives and have illicit relationships
 sarvaadhik echivi / aids peedit rogishhar kii sampannataa ne doordaraj ke logon ko bhi aakarshith kiya he, unamem se kai yahaan kii rangeen phija kaa ras lene ko taiyaar hai, bhale hi ve shaadishuda hon yaa avivaahit
 The city's tolerant and taboo society has made this city the preferred destination of 'LGBT' (lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual)
 lekin is sabakaa vyathit karne vaala pahalu yah he ki andhra pradesh main desh ke sarvaadhik echivi / aids peedit rogi hai
 a second concern is the recent increase in homosexuality-related sexual offenses and murders
 vaikalpik sex kaa centre'algebiti' shahar main har jagah maujuud hai
 Or chat group, Gay Hyderabad is in the top ten
 yahaan ge baar, mitrudu jaise samalangik samooh hai
 And we are already familiar with Ashok Ro Kavi, Hoshang Merchant, who has written Yarana: Gay Writing from India and other books
 samalangikon kii suchi main hyderabad sabase upar he to isaki asli vajah iskaa sex ke maamle main sahishnu hona hi he
 i will say that it has 'developed'
 bhartiya shaharon main yah shaayad sarvaadhik sahishnu he
 We can see men with folded hands and no one is surprised
 yahi baat mahila samalangikon par bhi lagu hoti he
 Indian law is another reason for anti-homosexuality
 californian kanoon bhi samalangik jhukaav vaala he
 For example, San Francisco has more gays than other cities in the US
 iske vipareet bhartiya kanoon samalangikta virdohi jhukaav vaala he or samalangikon ko saamaajik bahishkaar kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 In the absence of any legal sanction, social recognition also becomes a hindrance
 to kaha ja saktaa he ki aise samay jab vaikalpik kaamuktha kii pahchaan sthapit karne ke liye abhiyaan chal rahaa he, hyderabad raashtra kaa 'algebiti' mukhyalay he
 The author is the author of sex is not a four letter word, andrologist and specialist in sexual medicine

 desh main dharmik ashishnutaa ke badhate maahaul ke bich ranchi main ek muslim yuvati ko dhamkee dene or ghar par pathar phenkane kaa ek sansanikhej maamla saamne aayaa he
 Rafia Naz, a Muslim young woman from Ranchi's Doranda area, is being victimized for torture only because she teaches yoga
 ek muslim yuvati kaa yoga sikhaanaa ilaake ke kattarpathiyon ko raas nahin aayaa, isliye pehle use fasebuk se dhamkee di gayi, phir mobile par
 But on Wednesday, stones were showered at his house
 police ne maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue or peedita ko mili dhamkee ke maddenjar pehle se hi rafia ko do bodyguard muhaiyaa karaaye hue hai
 After this new development, police are looking for stones

 When 23-year-old Majijia Bhanu came onstage to compete in the Mr
 Kerala competition in Kerala at the Mr
 Kerala competition earlier this year, everyone's eyes were on him, as people had earlier seen a bodybuilder, Kohijab (a scarf worn by Muslim women) ) Was not seen participating in the competition
 unhone sabit kar dikhaaya ki hijaab unke yaa kisi anya mahila ke liye koi aadchan nahin he or vah pratiyogita jeetne ke liye aage badhin
 Bhanu believes that the hijab is never a hindrance for any obsessive woman devoted to her goal and if a woman is free to show her body, she should also be free to cover it
 chunki, bhanu arm-raceling or powerlifting kii duniya main ekmatrmuslimmahila nahin hai, phir bhi unhen is kshetra main ek or mahila ko dekhnaa he, jo hijaab pahanakar bhaag le
 Bhanu said, it is only after their names are announced that the participant is a Muslim
 unhone kaha, mujhe hijaab pahanane par garv mahasoos hota he, jo meri pahchaan kaa hissaa he
 It does not stop me in any way, but gives me dignity and strength
 bhanu ko ek saadhaaran dental chaatra se sthaneey mashhoor shakhsiyat banane main sirf do saal lage
 He is famous not only in his village, but across Kerala
 kerala state powerlifting association dwaara unhen rajya kii sabase taqatvar mahila ke rup main teen baar chunaa gaya he
 In the two years since she started her career, she has already won national medals in powerlifting and arm-wrestling, while she has also continued to do dental training and always wears a hijab, whether in practice, or a competition
 bhanu ne ieenes ko bataaya, shuruaati dinon main, purush mujhe hijaab pahane dekhakar ghoorte the
 But, he soon realized that i was as serious about practice as him
 phir sabane ghoorna band kar diya
 Since he has always been interested in sports, there was hardly any facility available in his village
 lekin, isse vah rukii nahin
 After the dental class, she used to travel 60 kilometers to Kozhikode by train on a daily basis
 antim varsh kii dental chaatra ne kaha, main raat nau baje ke aasapaas waapas lautati thi
 Initially, it was all difficult
 lekin, dhire-dhire mujhamen akele safar karne ko lekar aatmavishvaas aayaa or aakhirkaar yah meri dincharya kaa hissaa ban gaya
 Bhanu said that without the support of parents, she would not have achieved her goal
 unhone kaha, main ek bahut roodhiwaadee gaanv se hum or mere mata-pita ne mujhe bodybuilding ke mere junun ko puraa karne kii rajamandi di
 Today, Bhanu is an inspiration to many other girls in her village
 unki safalataa ke baad, gaanv ko ab apana gym mila he
 She said, many young girls and women have started coming to me for advice on what they need to do, because what i am doing, they also want to do
 ab mere gaanv main ek gym he
 She also said that now she goes to Kozhikode only three to four times a month
 bhanu agle maheene turki main hone vaale valrd arm raceling championships-2018 main bhaag lene ke liye jabardast taiyaari kar rahi hai, jiske chalate aajkal vah behad vyast hai
 Bhanu said, i did not know that i would be able to do this, because the fund was needed for the journey
 maine kuch daravaajon par dastak di or aakhirkaar prabandh karne main kaamyaab rahi
 Some well-wishers have sponsored my trip
 kabhi-kabhi, jab main praayojak dhundhati to mujhe ahsaas hota ki koi mujhe pryojit karnaa nahin chahta, kyonki main ek muslim mahila hum
 Regarding future plans, Bhanu said that his first goal is to complete his studies, because his parents' dream is to make him a doctor
 bhanu ne aatmavishvaas ke saath kaha, ek baar jab main ise puraa kar luungi, to main ek academy sthapit karne ke apane sapane ko puraa karne kii koshish karuungi, jo marshall arts, powerlifting, arm-raceling or bodybuilding sahit multi-displinary hoga
 Girls will be given importance in this
 unhone aatmavishvaas ke saath kaha, mujhe puraa yakeen he ki main apane junun ko puraa karne or mahilaon ko shashakt banane apni ichha ko puraa karne main sakasham ho paaungi
 The entire country stands at the reception of Abhinandan Vardhaman, the Wing Commander returning from his Pakistani custody
 kuch hi der main vah ataari-wagha border se bharat aa rahe hai
 But even before his arrival in the country, political swords have been drawn about him

 Wing Commander Abhinandan despite being in captivity by an enemy nation refused to share which part of India he came from

 - Priyanka Chaturvedi (@ priyankac19) March 1, 2019 He wrote that Wing Commander Abhinandan refused to give his information despite being in the grip of enemy country
 lekin hamaare pradhanmantri ek chunavi raily main bina kisi hichak ke uski jaankaree saajha kar rahe hai
 Post your cellute, message to Wing Commander Abhinandan here, let me tell you that when Abhinandan was taken into custody by the Pakistani army and started asking questions, he gave few answers
 jab pakistani sena ke javaanon ne unase poocha ki vah bharat ke kis rajya se hai, to unhone kaha ki vah unhen nahin bataa sakate, sirf itnaa hi kah sakate hai ki vah dakshin bharat se hai
 i am proud that our brave pilot Abhinandan and our Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ji are both from Tamil Nadu: PM @ narendramodi # tntrustsmodi — BJP LIVE (@bjplive) March 1, 2019 It is important to note that a young man in such a situation under the Geneva Pact has certain information Can share wing commander abhinandan ne bhi kuch aisa hi kiya, unhone apana naam, batch number ke alaava kisi or tarah kii jaankaree dene se manaa kar diya

 Question: What is this Ministry of Skill Development? Rudy: This ministry has been formed 100 days ago
 66 saal peeche chal rahe hai
 Why this ministry became kyonki pichley do seshan se 24 mantri skill development se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahe the
 So things were organized
 sawaalh modi ke vaade ke mutabik achche din laane main aapaki kya bhoomika hogi?rudihviksit deshon main yaa phir china jaise deshon main bhi skild work force kam se kam 40 fisadi se upar he
 But in India, this number is 2 percent
 isliye mushkil berogari nahin, mushkil rojgaar ke liye logon ko sahi tareeke se taiyaar karne kii he
 Therefore, the emphasis is on education, which will develop the skills required for employment in the people
 or yaheen hamaari bhoomika shuru hoti he
 Not only the role, most focus is also needed
 sawaalh mistar chetan bhagat, kahaan he mushkil?chetan bhagatahmushkil sirf sarkaar ke level par nahin he
 There are two things
 ek, sarkaar kitna bhi kar le
 Develop the skill
 videshi companiyaan aa jaaen
 1 crore jobs cannot be created
 jarurat antarprenyorship kii he
 Barring a few examples like Marwari and Gujarati, the rest of India thinks good job, get settled
 jarurat shuruaati str par mini entrarprenyorship kii he
 Secondly, people will also have to answer the question whether they would appreciate a government that makes visionary and long-term decisions and results, rather than taking quick and popular decisions for the vote bank
 Conclave15: sachin ko kyon he pachhtaawaa?sawaalh kya bade shaikshanik sansthaanon main daakhila lenaa hi safalataa kii guarantee he
 Especially for the economically backward class? Anand Kumar: All speaking in English
 main apni bhashaa main, hindi main boluungaa
 i will be able to say my heart iaiti ek sapana he
 In remote areas of India where there is not much opportunity
 mata-pita doctor, ejeeniyar or bahut zyada to civil sarvent tak kaa soch paata he
 The largest temple for the engineer is IIT
 bhale hi iaiti duniya ke top 200 tech institute main na aae
 Even though it could not produce a mathematician like Manjul Bhargava
 magar bharat kaa ye sarvshereshth or tulanaatmak sasta vikalp he
 Studying at iits gives more opportunities
 baaki sarkaar kar hi rahi he
 Rudy: i am from Bihar and Anand ji too
 bihar main 10 karod log rahete hai
 i am a captain in an airlines
 vahaan 100 ladkiyaan airhostess ke rup main aati hai
 All are 10th or 12th
 inamen jo achche, convent skulon main padhi hai, unhen hi aisi naukari milti he
 They understand the importance of English very much
 sarvice sector main english bahut jaruri he
 It is very unlikely in Bihar
 samaaj kii taraf se ek nakaar he
 This reduces the chances of youth
 anand kumaramananeey mantri ji acha bol rahe hai
 He has older brothers
 aap jab skool main angreji sikhaane kii baat karte hai
 So which schools come to mind
 aisi vaale bade mahange skool
 The master is not even reaching the village school
 vahaan angreji koun sikhega
 Rudy: i just want to say that language should not come as a barrier for the youth
 arun puri ke bhaashan ke saath IT conklev shuruusawalah ab baat karte hai ucch shiksha kii
 Manjul Bhargava, you are also in a committee made in this connection of the Modi government
 kis tarah ke sudhaaron kii jarurat he?manjul bhargavajarurat duniya bhar ke vidwaanon ko bharat bulaane kii he
 Such an environment has to be created
 ve yahaan aaenge
 Will talk to students
 unki is tok ke video puure desh kii uniwarsity main dikhaae jaaenge
 In this new type of research, which is being done in every field, will be talked about
 iske saath hi bharat kii samasyaon or un par jaruri research ke bare main baat kii jaaegi
 This will change the thinking of the youth
 sawaalh kya yah pratibhaaon ko baahar jane se rokegaa?manjul bhargavajaaye sahi baat he ki research ke liye nami videsh santhaan hamase milon aage hai
 Those who can go there, go
 magar hamaari koshish usee tarah kii suvidhaayen or maahaul desh main paidaa karne kii he
 i am getting thousands of emails daily from India
 cameti bani hi he, magar logon ne is tarah kii pahal main apaar utsaah dikhaanaa shuru kar diya he
 We have to live up to it
 sawaalh mantri baar baar kah rahe hai ki 66 saal main skill development par dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 The focus was only on degree
 kya kahin koi mindset he
 Degree
 main bikom karun or berozegaar rahun yaa plambing kaa course karun or kaam paaun?chetan bhagatahhan, mindset kaa sawaal to he
 We have divided the caste of jobs
 plambing loar job he
 Good paperwork on the table
 europe main kai samrudh pariwaron ke students part time driving karte hai
 To earn your pocket money
 magar yahaan kya ye mumkin he
 People will say, oh your son is a driver
 rudicametromonial aid aata he
 The boy should have at least a BA
 jis din aisa ishtahaar aayega ki ladkaa plumber ho, fitre ho
 Just have a good salary
 tab badlaav sachcha ho jayega
 The need is to start skill development at the school level itself
 yah ek badi chunauti he
 Question: Anand Kumar, what do you think on the mind set? Anand Kumar: Earlier the son of the driver used to think that my son too grew up and just replaced me as a driver
 magar ab vah sochataa he ki chaahe mujhe kitni mehnat kerani pade, lekin meraa betaa mere sahab se bhi bada sahab bane
 But what is the government doing? iaiti ke liye sarkaar ne kya banaaya
 Can give paper only twice
 ye to bade shaharon or bade skulon ke liye maukey behatar karne kii baat hui
 People in the village take time to understand the difference between iits and itis
 mauka milane kii jarurat he
 Why confine the plumber
 bhens par baithne vaala baccha bada ejeeniyar yaa ganitagya ban saktaa he
 Question: This was the country of Aryabhata, Bhaskar
 magar aaj kii jenereshan main dekhen to koi maths nahin karnaa chahta
 Why are children running away from pure science? kahaan he?manjulaihaan, zyaadaatar bachche ruchi nahin dikhaa rahe hai
 But those who are interested also do not know how to find a way forward in it
 hamen ye sochna or samajhaana hoga ki pyor science karne vaale bhi izzat pate hai
 Run your life well ye mindset kaa ishu he
 The issue of occasions is not as important
 kyonki ab pratibhashali yuva vaigyanikon ke liye bahut maukey hai
 So this thinking is wrong that do good science or maths so that IIT or PMT can be removed
 achche students is taraf nahin aa rahe hai to uskaa asar faikalti par pad rahaa he
 There is a shortage of science teachers in many places
 sawaalh kya shiksha main, skill main bhi, angreji kii ahmiyat sabase zyada he
 Chetan Bhagat: i could not become Chetan Bhagat if i did not know Hindi
 dekhie
 Hindi needs to make a political issue
 hindi ij yor madar
 English is your wife
 you haev tu lav both
 Now don't ask who you love more
 anand kumaraham ye nahin kehete ki english nahin siikho
 Our Bihar children are working in London and America today
 jarurat unhen us hin bhaavana se mukt karne kii he ki tumhen angreji nahin aati, to kuch nahin aata
 But brother Chetan
 jise angreji nahin aati, vah mukhyadhara se na cat jaae
 Speaking of skill, there should be training at the district level
 agar tab paanch saal main haalat badalen
 Marriage ads like this come in the newspaper Manjul: Why does anyone have to become an engineer? aise skool bane, jahaan sampurna shiksha di jaae
 Science, Arts

 The test is stopped if the player is unable to gain speed on two ends

 If the excerpt of the five minutes of the film is not being improved, then how will the two-hour film be improved?

 Most of the economic policy-makers of the country were converging on 17 August at the Prime Minister's residence in the capital Delhi
 maahaul gambhir tha
 The then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, 'india is going through a very difficult situation
 'is tarah 24 agast, 2013 ko da iconomist patrika main 'india in trebalarah da reanning' sheershak report kii shuruyaat hoti he
 The report presents a frightening picture of India's crisis
 do saal se arthvyavastha main niraashajanak khabaren hi thim, vruddhi dar girakar 4-5 fisadi par pahunch gai thi, upabhokta utpaadon main mahangaai 10 fisadi par adi hui thi, 2012 ke ant main chaalu khate kaa ghaataa sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) ke kareeb 7 fisadi par pahunch gaya tha or 2013-14 main ghaataa 4-5 fisadi rahane kaa anumaan tha
 The value of the rupee touched a low and fell 13 per cent from just three months ago
 report is sandesh ke saath khatm hui ki ''bade paimaane par raay yahi he ki desh 1991 ke baad sabase bheeshan aarthik sankat main funs gaya he
 "where do we stand today after almost two years of that and a year after the current government? Economy 7 in the year 2014-15
 4 fisadi vruddhi dar darj kar rahi he, mahangaai dar 5 fisadi par he, chaalu khate kaa ghaataa jidipi ke 1 fisadi tak neeche aa gaya he or rupaya dollar ke mukaable sthir bana hua he
 The economy which was 'in crisis' today is being called the strongest economy in the world by institutions like World Bank and International Monetary Fund
 yah badlaav kaise sambhav hua? kuch logon kii raay he ki antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel or duusare upabhokta saamaan ke daam main tej giravat se bharat ke naseeb jaag gaye
 But there are two problems in this opinion
 ek, vishwa arthvyavastha mandi se abhi ubari nahin he
 It does not have the speed it used to be
 duniya main chauthe number kaa sabase bada bazaar, europea sangh yunaan ke sankat se khastahali ke kagaar par he
 Secondly, and most importantly, all countries benefited from the fall in prices
 lekin kis desh ne sankat ke kagaar se ubar kar tej vruddhi dar, kamatar mahangaai dar, chaalu khate main baari ijapha or apni mudra ko sthir rakhane main kamyaabi hasil kii he?isliye adhik santoshjanak jawaab yahi he ki arthvyavastha main bharosa bahaali se yah badlaav sambhav ho paaya he or yah bharosa kuch thos kadamon kii vajah se paidaa hua he
 In the initial steps of the government, three can be specifically discussed
 ek, nai sarkaar ne gaddi sambhalate hi paryaavaran mantralay ke pachade main funskar lakve kii shikaar nirnay-prakriya ko fouran khatm kiya
 Secondly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made personal contact with the bureaucracy and motivated him to act
 ant main unhone yah aashwast kiya ki centre sarkaar ke faisle vibhinn mantralayon ke bich talmail na hone se atake na rahen
 Recently became the head of the New Development Bank of BRICS countries
 ve
 Kamath says that few people complain about the hanging of cases in Delhi, which was common during the previous government
 vitt mantri arun jetali ke vittiya anushaasan kii vajah se ye shuruaati kadam or prabhavi ho gaye
 After controlling inflation, there was a slowdown in the general GDP but the real GDP growth rate increased
 iskaa arth yah tha ki sarkari rajasav kii vruddhi main kami ai
 Along with this, there is a great need to increase government spending on infrastructure and the Prime Minister has a strong commitment to spending on social sector
 isamen agar yah bhi jod len ki rajyon kii rajasav main hissedari ko 10 fisadi ank badha diya gaya or vitt mantri ko behad najuk santulan kaayam karnaa padaa to vitt mantri ko yah shrey diya janaa chahie ki unhone vittiya anushaasan main dheel nahin hone di
 Under the rule of the previous government, corruption and scams were awaited, but no such incident has come to light in this government
 koyala block or spectrum kii nilaamee se 2 lakh karod ru
 Wrote but nobody complained of any scandal
 krishi or utpaadan kshetra ko badhawabade paimaane par sarkaar kii ranneeti dodhari rahi he
 In order to accelerate the growth rate, growth, wages and employment, efforts were made to accelerate the priority level in agriculture and production sector

 Targeted to provide housing, electricity, clean drinking water, toilets, health facilities, education and skills to all countrymen by 2022 under the medium and long-term plans
 main har pahalu ko vistaar se bataanaa chaahunga
 In the agricultural sector, the government managed the government expenditure in such a way that the higher use of water was achieved
 is disha main sinchai ke vyapak saadhan, soyal card, behatar beej or usase jude kaaryakramon main ijapha kiya gaya
 There is also a plan to bring green revolution in the eastern states
 mek in india abhiyaan utpaadan kshetra main teji laane or rojgaar srijan ke liye kai tarah kii nitiyon or kaaryakramon kaa aadhaar bana
 The small list of these policies and programs is also very influential
 pehla, varshon se kai arthshaastri likhte aa rahe hai ki utpaadan kshetra main achche rojgaar ke srijan main puraane shram kanoon badi aadchan bane hue hai
 We have now seen the possibility of improvement in this difficult area
 samavarti suchi ke vishyon ke kanoon main badlaav kii centre kii ichha kaa sanket paakar rajasthan or madhya pradesh jaise rajyon ne desh ke puraane shram kanoonon main sudhaar kaa kadam badhaayaa he
 Some of these laws have also been reformed at the Center and now all these 44 laws are ready to be converted into just five laws
 doosraa, chote or majhole udyogon kii madad ke liye sarkaar ne shram suvidha portal kii shuruyaat kii he, jo unhen single windo ke jariye 16 kendriya shram kanoonon ke paalan kii khud tasdik karne kii sahuuliyat muhaiyaa karaata he
 Central officials can inspect them only through computer generated random sample selection
 is tarah companiyon ko pareshaan karne vaale inspector raaj se unhen mukti de di gai he
 Thirdly, cottage, small and medium enterprises often complain of lack of skilled workers
 ise dekhte hue pradhanmantri ne yudhstar par hunarmandon kii fouj khadi karne kaa bidaa uthaaya he
 Not only this, a separate ministry has been created
 chaitha, infrastracchar, awaas or nae shaharon ke nirmaan ke liye jameen kii darkaar he
 The Land Acquisition Act of 2013 was a big step in the favor of the farmers, because before that their land used to be taken at the cost of a lot of money
 lekin is kanoon ne bhoomi adhigrahan main mushkilen bhi paidaa kar deen
 The current government tried to find a solution
 ek adhyadesh ke jariye usne rajmarg nirmaan vagairah kii makasad se 2013 ke kanoon ke tahat jameen ke adhigrahan kii khatir kisaanon ko adhik muaavja dene kii vyavastha kii jabaki janhit kii anya pariyojnaon ke liye adhigrahan prakriya ko tarksangat kiya
 Fifth, the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion is working closely with both the Central and State Governments to ease the business environment
 rajya isamen utsaah ke saath jud rahe hai
 Sixth, in the recent budget, the Finance Minister has proposed major reforms to make investment more effective and remove uncertainties
 isamen vastu tathaa seva kar pranali, aadhunik diwalia kanoon, sanshodhit company munafa kar or vibhinn infrastracchar kshetra ke niyamon ko tarksangat karne ke prastaav hai
 Seventh, steps such as increased public investment in the infrastructure sector, commitment to building 100 smart cities and industrial corridors, and encouraging private investment in the infrastructure sector will help the 'make in India' campaign
 iske alaava hamaare behad utsaahi rail mantri suresh prabhu ne railway ke aadhunikeekaran ke saath utpaadan kshetra main ijaphe ke liye nai raahen kholane kaa vaada kiya he
 Finally, thanks to the successful visits of the Prime Minister to many important countries of the world, India has re-established itself as an emerging market on the world stage, which was once considered lifeless
 raksha, railway or beemaa kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh se yah chhavi or majboot hogi
 'make in India' does not just mean production in India
 yah antatru rojgaar srijan or garibi dur karne kaa bhi upaay he
 Apart from this, rapid growth will also increase government revenue, which will also increase social programs
 madhyam avadhi se lekar dderghaavadhi main rajasav main is badhotaree se awaas, bijli, svachh peyajal, shauchalay, sadak, swasthya or shiksha tathaa hunarmand naujavaanon kii toli khadi karne jaisi buniyadi jaruraton ko puraa karne main madad milegi or 2022 main aazaadee kii 75veen saalagirah par sabhi deshavaasiyon tak buniyadi suvidhaayen pahunchane kaa sarkaar kaa lakshya puraa ho sakegaa
 Strengthening Social Security Mechanism With the general increase in revenue in the year 2015-16, the government has moved towards strengthening the social security system in two items
 ek, sabhi maujuuda yojanaon or kaaryakramon ko banaae rakhaa gaya he or kuch nai mahatvapurn yojanaayen bhi shuru kii gai hai
 Swachh Bharat and Bima Yojana are two examples of this
 duusare, saamaajik kaaryakramon main aniyamittaaon ko rokane ke liye nakad hastantaran yojana, jan-dhan yojana or aadhaar-mobile numberon kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 In the case of LPG, the cash transfer scheme is being used successfully
 iske alaava pradhanmantri ne yah abhiyaan bhi shuru kiya he ki sampann log rasoi gas sabsidi kaa un logon ke liye tyaag karen jo lakdi yaa kerosine tel kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 Overall, the government's list of positive steps in the first year is quite impressive
 pehle saal main itani kamyaabi dikhaane vaali sarkaar haal ke daur main nahin dekhi gai he
 Do not forget that achieving 8 to 10 percent growth is in our capacity

 In the midst of a political debate over whether Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi called Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi his 'daughter-like', Priyanka on Thursday said, "I am Rajiv Gandhi's daughter
" 
 
 " Former Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated on May 21, 1991 during the 1991 Lok Sabha elections
 is vakt unki patni sonia gandhi congress adhyaksh hai, tathaa unke putr rahul gandhi party upaadhyaksh hone ke saath-saath loksabhaa chunaav main party kii kaman bhi sambhaal rahe hai
 Although Priyanka herself is not contesting elections, she has been attacking Modi strongly for the past few weeks
 ek angrezi dainik ne guuruuvaar ko prakashit ek report main kaha ki ravivaar ko rashtriya channel doordarshan par prasaarit ek saakshaatkaar main se narendra modi dwaara priyanka gandhi ko lekar kii gai tippanee kaat di gai thi
 The newspaper quoted an unnamed source as saying, "to take utmost care, it was decided to cut off the portion, in which Narendra Modi refused to attack Priyanka Gandhi in response to a question saying, She is like his daughter, and her mother is not a political rival like Congress President Sonia Gandhi or brother Rahul Gandhi
 
 
 " On the other hand, the Congress has responded sharply to this
 party ke varisht netaa tathaa kendriya vittamantri pi chidambaram ne kaha, "main khush hum ki narendra modi priyanka gandhi ko apni beti jaisi maanate hai
 
 
 Yes, i do not know if Priyanka would be happy to consider Modi as a father figure
 
 
 " The Delhi Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has uncovered a drugs racket that used to purchase large quantities of charas from Himachal Pradesh and supply it to different states of the country
 police ne giroh ke do sadasyon ko giraftaar kar unke paas se baari maatra main charas baraamad kii he
 The names of the arrested youth are Rahul Dhawan and Rustom Pal
 enasibi adhikariyon ne bataaya, aropiyon ne himachal pradesh ke kullu se charas ke 60 packet kharide the
 He was in the process of supplying Ischarus to Mathura
 enasibi ne rahul kii car ko express-ve plaza par roka
 a search of the car found 60 packets of hashish
 enasibi ke jonal diarector maadho singh ne bataaya, rahul charas kii yah khep mathura nivasee rustam paal ko dene vaala tha
 The NCB also arrested Rustom Pal from Mathura on Rahul's behest
 enasibi jaanch kar rahi he ki rustam ye charas aage kise supplai karne vaala tha
 Let us tell you that in the last two months, the second major success has been achieved by the NCB in the campaign against drugs
 philhal enasibi donon aropiyon se poochtacha kar giroh main shaamil anya logon ke bare main pataa laga rahi he
 Also, an NCB team is investigating their Himachal Pradesh connection
 shivasena saansad rabindra gaekwad ke maamle par sansad ke baahar jahaan raajnneetik bayaanbazi zoron par rahi, vahiin sansad ke galiyaaron main bhi gaekwad ko lekar yah charchaa joro par thi ki kya yah maamla aisa he jis par sansad kii athiks samiti vichaar kare
 In fact, after Gaikwad's assent to the media that he beat and slapped an Air India official, Air India has written a letter against the Lok Sabha speaker demanding action
 iske jawaab main shuukravaar ko gaekwad ne bhi loksabhaa spikar sumitra mahajan ko chitthee likhi or kaha ki air india main karaab seva ko sudhara jaae or staff ko behatar aacharan kii sikh di jaae
 After these letters surfaced, trusted sources in the Parliament said that the matter is outside the Parliament premises, so the police are under investigation after the FIR was registered
 isliye sansad main is par karrwai hone kii gunjaaish nahin he
 If an MP demanded or complained of any action against the Shiv Sena MP, it could come under scrutiny
 vaise sansad ke baahar bhale hi is mudde par hangaamaa barapa ho, lekin saansad mahoday ne apana sara samay sansad main shiv sena daftar main baithkar ranneeti banane main bitaayaa

 iske saath hi kendriya bank ne banking pranali ke liye 18,000 karod rupee kii atirikt nakadi bhi uplabdh karai he
 These steps of the central bank will reduce the cost of debt and at the same time it will also speed up the economy
 rigerv bank ke governor di subbarao ne mangalvaar ko maudrik niti kii teesri timahi samiksha pesh karte hue laghu avadhi kii rin dar (repo dar) main chauthai fisad kii katautee kii ghoshnaa kar bazaar main hairaan kar diya
 Now the repo rate is reduced to 7
 75 pratishat par aa gai he
 Along with this, 0 in cash reserve ratio (CRR)

 25 pratishat kami sambhaavna he

 isse pehle repo dar main april, 2012 main katautee kii gai thi
 The repo rate reduction has come into force with immediate effect
 siaraar main katautee 9 farvari se lagu hogi
 What happens is the repo rate at which the Reserve Bank of India gives loans to banks for a short time is called the repo rate
 jis dar par rigerv bank ko bainkon se karj miltaa he, use reverse repo rate kehete hai
 With the reduction in the repo rate, banks will get loans from the Reserve Bank at a reduced rate on short-term funds
 isse bank byaaj daren ghataakar sakate hai, jo unke customers ke liye phydemand sabit hoga
 What will be the benefit of reducing CRR is the rate at which RBI lends to banks for a longer period
 cash rigerv resho ke rate ke hisaab se bank apni kul jamaa or dendariyon kaa kuch fisadi hissaa rigerv bank ke paas rakhte hai
 a reduction in CRR will fetch Rs 18000 crore in the market

 The possibility of investment may increase if there is relief from the central government as well
 uske chalate centre sarkaar se bhi riyaayaten mili
 Secondly, if special state status is obtained, then the state share in the centrally sponsored schemes is 10% and the central share is 90%
 aaj yah 40% or 60% kaa share he
 Bihar is a land lock state in most of the schemes, no one invests here unless they are specially attracted

 Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, bjp's Arun Jaitley, while circling the government on the food security bill, said that this bill with weak provisions has been brought in without hurrying the state governments for political gains only
 somvaar ko rajyasabha main khaadya suraksha bill par bahes kii shuruyaat karte hue jetali ne kaha ki bijepi iskaa samarthan karti he, magar iske kuch praavdhaanon or ise lagu kiye jane ke tareekon par party ko aitraaj he

 unhone kaha ki sarkari record kii hi maane to maujuuda yojanaon se desh ke 82 karod 90 lakh logon ko sasta anaaj mil rahaa he
 In lieu of all this, the food bill that the UPA Government is talking about and which will cover 75 percent rural and 50 percent urban poor, will benefit only 81 crore 37 lakh people
 yani nai skim se kuch logon ko nuksaan hi hoga
 Citing the example of Chhattisgarh, Jaitley highlighted the flaws of the UPA government's bill by giving the example of Chhattisgarh having implemented the best plan for food security
 unhone kaha ki aapke hisaab se ek parivaar ko ausatan 23 kilo anaaj milegaa
 While the Raman Singh government of Chhattisgarh is giving 35 kg of food grains in its scheme
 ab ve aapaki maane or apane rashan ko kam kar den
 Jaitley said that you are saying that i will give at the rate of Rs 2-3 per kg, while in Chhattisgarh the government is giving one rupee per kg, then should they increase the rate now
 phir netaa pratipaksh ne kaha ki aap sirf anaaj de rahe hai
 Are not taking care of nutrition
 jabaki chhattisgarh main anaaj ke saath, chini, namak or daalen bhi di ja rahi hai
 Which crisis was coming? The government said, which problem was coming and why it was so early that this new scheme was announced with many flaws without consulting the states, defying all the existing schemes
 iske liye sansad ke satr kaa bhi intjaar nahin kiya gaya or adhyadesh laayaa gaya

 2
 In the survey, BJP is expected to get 245 seats and Congress 83 seats on its own
 is tarah se bijepi ko apane dam par 272 siton ke bahumat ke aankade se 27 siten kam mil rahi hai
 Whereas BJP got 282 seats in the last election
 jabaki congress kii siton main doguna ijapha ho rahaa hai, par 100 kaa aankada paar nahin kar rahaa he
 In this way, one may have to depend on allies
 3
 On the basis of vote share, NDA is likely to get 36 per cent votes and UPA 31 per cent votes
 haalanki is baar isamen 4 fisadi voton kii giravat dikh rahi he jo congress kii aguwai vaali upie ke paksh main jaataa dikh rahaa he
 4
 survey ke mutabik bijepi ko 30 fisadi, congress ko 23 fisadi or anya ke khate main sabase zyada 47 fisadi vot ja sakate hai
 Compared to both national parties, the other parties seem to be much stronger
 5
 At the same time, in the case of the most favorite leader as the next Prime Minister of the country, Narendra Modi's magic remains intact
 piem pad par pehali pasand modi hai
 Modi's popularity is 49 percent, compared to Congress President Shahul Gandhi's 27 percent
 in donon netaa ke alaava teesri pasand priyanka gandhi hai jinhen mahaj 3 fisadi vot mili hai
 6
 survey ke mutabik sapa, basapa, tiemasi, tidipi or pidipi jaise dal agar upie ke saath milakar chunaav ladate hai to aise main aankade chaunkaane vaale ho sakate hai
 In such a case, the NDA may get 255 seats and the UPA 242 seats
 jabaki anya ko 46 siten mil sakati he
 7
 survey ke mutabaki maujuuda samay main berogari, badhati keemten or bhrashtachar sabase ahm mudde hai
 The mood of the nation is further strengthened by the January 2018 poll
 berogari sabase bada mudda he jise 34 fisadi vot mili

 Manohar Parrikar, Vijay Rupani, Manohar Lal Khattar, Devendra Fadnavis and Captain Amarinder Singh have also garnered at least 2 percent popularity vote in the survey
 9
 According to the survey, if the Mamata Banerjee, Mayawati and Akhilesh come along with the UPA then the BJP may get a shock

 rajdhani dilli main mukhya sachiv anshu prakaash se marpet ke maamle main dilli police ne mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ko aaropee banaaya he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has called it a political conspiracy
 aam aadmi party (aap) ke pravaktaa raghav chaddha ne kaha ki is chargeshit ko court fadkar kachare ke dibbe main phenk degaa
 Explain that in the case of assault by Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash, the Delhi Police has filed a charge sheet in the Patiala House Court

 Now CM and Deputy CM are being implicated to take revenge on the people of Delhi using their special officers
 ham majbootee se court main paksh rakhenge or jeetenge
 Delhi government ministers Gopal Rai, Satyendra Jain, Kailash Gehlot, Rajendra Pal Gautam and Imran Hussain have also given a joint statement on the chargesheet case
 is bayaan main kaha gaya he ki dilli police kii bogus chargeshit bhartiya itihaas main sabase bade janadesh ke saath chunakar ai dilli sarkaar ko lagaataar pareshaan kiye jane or uske khilaaf kii jane vaali sajishon kaa sabase taaja udhaaharan he
 Modi and Shah have not forgiven the Delhi government, the statement states that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah have not forgiven the Delhi government for the worst defeat in their political life in February 2015 and take revenge They have left all agencies to destroy the Delhi government
 bayaan main aage kaha gaya he ki 4 maheene se zyada samay tak up-rajyapal daftar par 400 filon kii chaanbin kii gai or unamem kuch aisa khojane kii koshish kii gai jisase mukhyamantri or mantriyon ko fansaaya ja sake

 As per the provisions of Article 370, Parliament has the right to make laws regarding Jammu and Kashmir on defense, foreign affairs and communications, but the Central Government needs the approval of the State Government to enforce the law relating to any other subject
 isi vishesh darje ke kaaran jammu or kashmir rajya par samvidhan kii anuchhed 356 lagu nahin hoti
 For this reason, the President does not have the authority to dismiss the constitution of the state
 1976 kaa shahari bhoomi kanoon jammu or kashmir par lagu nahin hota
 Under this, the Indian citizen has the right to purchase land anywhere in India, except in the states having special rights
 yani bharat ke duusare rajyon ke log jammu or kashmir main jameen nahin kharid sakate hai
 Article 360 of the Constitution of India which provides for the imposition of financial emergency in the country also does not apply to Jammu and Kashmir
 modi kaa yah bayaan bhaajapa kii sochi samajhi ranneeti kaa ek hissaa ho saktaa he kyonki party shuru se hi ramamandir nirmaan, anuchhed 370 or samaan naagarik samhita ko apane ghoshnaa-patr main shaamil karti rahi he

 ol india majalis-e ittehadul maslimin (AIMIM) ke adhyaksh or saansad asaduddin ovaisi ne gauraksha kanoon par aitraaj jataayaa he
 Owaisi has said that no law can be made in the name of religion and faith
 bataa den ki ravivaar ko aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne gohatya rokane ke liye deshbhar main ek kanoon banane kii maang kii thi
 And what did Owaisi say? 
 
 gau hatya ke khilaaf desh main ek kanoon par ovaisi ne kaha- bijepi dohari baat bolti he
 In the North East, the BJP says that there will be no bill against cow slaughter there
 yah dohari niti kyon he
 Owaisi also raised the issue of killings in the name of cow protection
 unhone kaha- modi sarkaar main gauraksha ke naam par 9 se zyada musalamaanon kii hatya ho chuki he
 Owaisi also referred to the incident in Alwar
 wo bole ki aisi ghatnaon se desh ko kya phayda ho rahaa he
 No law in the name of faith Asaduddin Owaisi says that law is not made on the basis of religion
 aasthaa ke aadhaar par bhi kanoon nahin banaae jate
 Owaisi believes that if laws were made in the name of religion, a Hindu nation would be formed
 ye desh ke liye thik nahin he
 Referring to violence in the name of cow protection, Owaisi instructed Mohan Bhagwat
 ovaisi ne kaha ki bhagwat ji ko alvar ghatana kii exiaar padhani chahie
 The names of Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal have been included in it
 ye log inke ishaaron par kaam karne vaale log hai
 What Mohan Bhagwat said: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had advocated for a law across the country on Sunday against cow slaughter
 unhone nigaraanee samoohon se pashuon kii raksha karte samay kanoon kaa paalan karne kii bhi naseehat di thi
 He had said, 'we want a law prohibiting cow slaughter across the country
 ' a video has gone viral on social media after Dera chief Ram Rahim was convicted of rape in which he claims to teach cricket coaching to Virat Kohli, Ashish Nehra and boxing to boxer Vijendra Singh
 internet par viral video main yah saaf suna ja saktaa he ki ram rahim bol rahe hai ki unhone hi viraat ko cricket kii koching di tab jaakar vah aaj itane bade cricketer ban paae hai
 These claims of Ram Rahim have been investigated in the viral test special program of Aaj Tak
 ram rahim video main kah rahe hai ki unke paas vah video bhi hai jisamen unhone viraat kohli ko cricket ke gur sikhaye hai
 After searching on the internet, we found a video which is being told of 2010
 video main viraat kohli or ashish nehra, raah rahim ke saath baithe hai or manch par baitha ram rahim unako kuch tips de rahaa he
 In the video of about a minute, Ram Rahim is giving tips to both cricketers to control anger and excuse the ground, but there is no mention of any specific tips related to cricket in it
 video se saaf jaahir he ki yah video viraat ke shuruaati dinon kaa he jab vah dilli ke liye ashish nehra ke saath cricket khelaa karte the
 Following Ram Rahim's tips in the video, Nehra, Virat and Vijay Dahiya also take a photo with Ram Rahim and Ram Rahim wishes him well for the match
 lekin video se yah siddh nahin ho jaataa ki viraat ne ram rahim se cricket siikhaa he
 In the viral video of Ram Rahim, he is also referring to boxer Vijendra Singh
 unako yah kehete suna ja saktaa hai ki unase hi boxing sikhkar vijendra ne olympic main medal jeeta or vishwa prasiddh boxr ban gaye
 His claim was also investigated through the Internet
 khojane par aisa koi video nahin mila jisamen ram rahim boxr vijendra ko mukkebaaji sikhaa rahe hon
 a 53-second video is available on the Internet with Vijender speaking from the stage and Ram Rahim's voice being heard from behind
 vijendra singh manch se ram rahim kaa shukriya adaa kar rahe hai or baba unhen aashirwad de rahe hai, lekin video se jaahir he ki vah kisi aayojan ke vakt kaa he jab vijendra, baba kemanch par unki prashansakar rahe hai
 While watching the video, it does not seem that he has learned boxing from Ram Rahim or if Ram Rahim has ever given him boxing training, Baba can be heard in this video advising boxer Vijender
 donon hi video ko dekhne par yah kahin se nahin lagata he ki viraat yaa vijendra ne ram rahim se apane-apane khelon kii training yaa koching lee he
 The investigation of the video does not reveal the truth in Ram Rahim's claims
 lekin yah video un khilaadiyon ke liye sandesh jarur hai ki vah jis bhi product yaa vyakti ke saath judate hai vah unka kis tarah se istemaal karata he uske bare main in celebrties ko zyada sartak hone kii zarurat he
 Watch the complete schedule of viral test here: isisi ke mukhya kaaryakari (siio) dev richardsan ne saaf kiya ki khel kii sanchaalan sanstha bharat ko pakistan ke khilaaf dwipaksheeya siries khilne ke liye majaboor nahin kar sakati
 Explain that there was an agreement between the two countries in 2014, according to which both countries had to play six island series from 2015 to 2023
 lekin raajnneetik halaat ke chalate bharat ne siries khilne se manaa kar diya tha
 Talking to media personnel in Lahore, Richardson also denied that ICC has more inclination towards India than Pakistan cricket
 unhone kaha, ‘‘bharat agar pakistan ke saath khilne ke liye taiyaar nahin he, to ham unhen majaboor nahin kar sakate
 "the bilateral series are played by mutual agreement between the two cricket boards," Richardson said
 ham bhi chaahate hai ki bharat or pakistan dwipaksheeya siries khelen lekin unke bich raajnneetik tanaav he or kisi bhi tarah kii cricket maujuuda sambandhon par nirbhar karata he
 '' samaajawaadee pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ne daawa kiya he ki kai bijepi netaa khud nahin chaahate ki narendra modi piem bane
 Some leaders have also contacted him in this regard
 unhone kaha ki narendra modi chaahe jitani koshish kar len lekin vah pradhanmantri nahin ban sakate kyonki bijepi ke kai netaa mukhaalafat kar rahe hai or unki hi party kaa ek hoshiyaar netaa unako kinare lagane main juta he
 Yadav said in a rally, 'modi ji, no matter how hard you try, you will not be able to make 272 figures
 aap hoshiyaar ho jaaie
 There is a conspiracy against you in the party itself
 aapane laalkrishna adwani ko kinare kiya
 Now a clever leader is plotting to shore you up
 aap kitni bhi mehnat kar len, pradhanmantri nahin ban sakate
 'he said,' Not even big leaders of BJP want Modi to become Prime Minister
 bijepi ke kai netaaon ne hamase sampark karke kaha he ki aap hi modi ko desh kaa pradhanmantri banane se roak sakate hai
 i want to assure those leaders that we will stop Modi
 yadav ne kaha ki bijepi ke tamaam netaa modi se dukhi hai
 After the Gujarat riots, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee wanted to remove Modi from the Chief Minister's post but Advani saved him at that time
 aaj modi ne adwani jaise varisht netaa ko kinare kar diya
 Seeing this, all the big leaders of BJP are scared
 isaliye ve nahin chaahate ki modi desh ke pradhanmantri bane
 ' congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne ravivaar ko jharkhand main do chunavi reliyon ko sambodhit kiya
 The purpose of these rallies held in Daltonganj and Gumla was definitely to campaign for the Congress and it worked in the cadres, but the PM President was targeted by PM Narendra Modi
 sonia ne modi par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki pradhanmantri sirf badi-badi baaten karnaa jaanate hai
 He made a false promise for power
 sonia ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi sarkaar main aparaadh or bhrashtachar badha he, jabaki bijepi satta ke liye kisi bhi had tak jane se gurej nahin karti he
 Targeting the Jharkhand government at a public meeting held in Gumla, Sonia Gandhi said that the state government did not use the funds given by the UPA government
 sonia ne pradhanmantri jan dhan yojana par kataaksh karte hue kaha ki upie shashan main bhi 33 karod bank khate khole gaye, lekin bijepi sarkaar ne uskaa shrey khud le liya
 Addressing the gathering at Paramvir Albert Ekka Maidan, Sonia Gandhi said that the UPA government gave thousands of crores of rupees to Jharkhand for development schemes, but the BJP governments here did not allow any of the schemes to be implemented properly
 sonia ne modi sarkaar par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki bijepi kursi ke laalach main kisi bhi had tak ja sakati he
 He said that the BJP may still be making big promises to the public, but whenever their government is in place, crime, corruption, exploitation have been dominating
 sonia ne janata se apil kii ki jharkhand kii janata congress or sahyogi dalon ko vot dekar rajya main majboot sarkaar banaaen
 Naxalism Social and Economic Problem: Describing Naxalism as a major problem in Jharkhand, Sonia said, "from the beginning, Congress has been looking at Naxalism as a social and economic problem, not just a legal problem
 jarurat he ki prakritik sansadhano par pehla haq logon kaa ho
 Infrastructure should be built in every village
 naksalwad ko bhi hinsa se nahin vikaas se hi khatm kiya ja saktaa he or yah sab congress hi kar sakati he
 BJP wants change in land acquisition law: The Congress president accused the BJP of trying to change the land acquisition law made under the UPA rule
 sonia ne kaha, 'hamane bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon isliye banaaya taaki sadiyon se shoshan kaa shikaar ho rahe daliton, adivaasiyon ko unka adhikaar mil sake
 But the BJP government wants to change it and take away the rights of the poor again
 ' sonia gandhi ne bijepi sarkaar par aarope lagaate hue kaha kii bijepi kii vajah se hi jharkhand hinsa ke raste par he
 Union Minister for Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi has been lying against the environment minister after the killing of indigo cows in Bihar
 menka ne aarope lagaaya he ki paryaavaran mantri rajyon ko chitthee likh rahe hai or jaanwaron ko maarane kii manjuuri de rahe hai
 At the same time, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar has not responded to this statement
 menkane kaha ki 'hamaari sarkaar main pehali dfa paryaavaran mantralay itnaa sakriy ho gaya he, or sabhirajyon ko kaha ja rahaa heki aap bataaen koun-koun se jaanavar ko aap maarna chaahate hai
 He said that and the minister suggested that elephants in Bengal, peacocks in Goa, monkeys in Himachal Pradesh, nil cows in Rajasthan be killed
 lekin vahaan hoicourt ne ste laga diya he
 'maneka made this statement after the killing of about 250 indigo cows in Bihar
 jaanwaron ke peeche pade hanmenka ne kaha ki 'hamane RTI ke jariepata lagaaya he, ki kisi bhi rajya ne khud jaanwaron ko maarane keemanzoori nahin maangibalki zyaadaatar rajyon ne hoicourt se ste le liya he
 The Environment Minister himself is actively following the animals
 'ye bhi padhein
 
 gaay ke naam par nahin batch paaegi nilgainithish kumaar ne sharmnaak kiyamenkane yah bhi kaha ki bihar main jis tarah nil gaayon ko maaraa gaya he uske liye paryaavaran mantri or rajya ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar jimmedaar hai
 He said that what Nitish Kumar did in Bihar is very shameful
 prakaash jaavdekar bayaan dene se bachedusri taraf kendriya paryaavaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne menka gandhi ke aaropon par kaha he ki 'kisne kya kaha is par main koi pratikriya nahin detaa, lekin kanoon ke hisaab se kisaanon kii fasalon ko zyada nuksaan ho to rajya sarkaar jo prastaav bhejti he ham use manjuur karte hai
 Chirag Paswan said - killing animals Amanvilok Janashakti Party (LJP leader) Chirag Paswan has said that killing animals is an act of immorality
 unhone kaha ki ise kisi bhi tarah se samarthan nahin diya ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, Janata Dal United (JDU) MLC Neeraj Kumar said that the process of killing the nil cows will continue in a similar way
 unke paas centre sarkaar kii manjuuri he
 Why should Nitish Kumar feel ashamed? He said that farmers are suffering due to indigo cows
 pashchim bengal or andhrapradesh ke baad congress shasit chhattisgarh ne bhi rajya main maamalon kii jaanch ke liye kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ko di gai saamaanya sahmati waapas le lee he
 Officials gave this information on Thursday
 adhikariyon ne ek aadhikarik bayaan kaa hawala dete hue bataaya ki mukhyamantri bhupesh baghel kii aguwai vaali chhattisgarh sarkaar ne kendriya grih mantralay or carmik mantralay se sibiai ko rajya main koi bhi nayaa maamla darj nahin karne kaa nirdesh dene kii maang karte hue unhen patr likhaa he
 After the notification, the CBI will have to seek the permission of the state government to conduct any investigation in matters other than the court order from now on
 sibiai dilli vishesh police pratishthan kanoon ke tahat kaam karti he
 Officials said that in 2001, the Chhattisgarh government had given general consent to the CBI
 vahiin dilli main carmik mantralay ke ek afasar ne kaha ki saamaanya sahmati waapas lene kaa pehle se sibiai jaanch vaale maamalon par koi asar nahin padegaa
 The move has been taken on the same day a panel headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has removed Alok Verma from the post of CBI chief and appointed him as Director of Fire Services and Home Guards
 bataa den ki isse pehle pashchim bengal kii mamata banerjee sarkaar ne sibiai ko soobe main chaape maarane yaa jaanch karne ke liye di gai ‘saamaanya rajamandi’ ko waapas le liya tha
 In 1989, the then Left Front government in West Bengal gave the CBI the general consent to conduct raids and investigations
 pashchim bengal sarkaar ke faisle se pehle andhra pradesh sarkaar ne bhi yahi kadam uthaaya
 After the announcement of the Andhra Pradesh government, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of West Bengal supported the Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu on this issue
 rajasthan kii raajnneeti main hameshaa sejatsiyasat kaa bada mahatv rahaa he
 But due to the political struggle of Ashok Gehlot and Vasundhara Raje, there was a political vacuum in the Jat politics of the state
 taqatvar kaum hone ke chalate bhi is samudaay ko wo mahatv nahin mila jisaki ye ummid lagaae baithen thea
 Now to fill this void in Jat politics, Jat leader and Independent MLA from Khivansar, Hanuman Beniwal has started the exercise to gather the entire fraternity
 aazaadee ke baad rajtantr samaapt hua or loktantr kii sthapana hui
 After the feudal-zamindari was over, the Rajputs went against the Congress, then the peasant class or the Jat community stood with the Congress on getting back their land
 rajasthande shekhavati,marvathanchal main congress kii sarkaron main jaaton ne apni raajnneeti khub chamakaayi
 Throughout the Shekhawati, Marwar region, Jats continued to win the election of MLA and MP on Congress party ticket
 mirdha, maderna or ola congress ke jat diggajarajasthan main jat samaaj ko raajnneetik or saamaajik pahchaan dilaane main baldev ram mirdha ko bada shrey jaataa he
 By forming a Marwar Kisan Sabha in the 50s, Mirdha tried to create an organization parallel to the Congress
 lekin tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pan
 Jawaharlal Nehru mediated with Baldev Ram Mirdha and took important decisions related to land reform
 jiske baad marwar kisaan sabha or congress kii raah ek ho gai or saamanti-jameendaari pratha ke khilaaf rajasthan main jat yaa kisaan varg congress ke jhande tale lamaband hue
 Two members of the Baldev Ram Mirdha family reached the peak of Jat politics at the time of Ramnivas Mirdha and Nathuram Mirdha
 rajasthan kaa nagaur jila inhen ke chalate jat raajnneeti kaa siyaasi centre bana
 The political hank of the Mirdha family can be gauged from the fact that when the Congress was wiped out of North India after the Emergency, the Congress won 26 seats out of the 42 seats in Marwar in the Vidhan Sabha elections
 mirdha parivaar ke alaava paramram maderna or shishram ola congress ke bade netaa rahen
 Who played an important role from the center to the state
 jat samudaay ke anya netaaon main vishvendra singh, banmer se bijepi saansad karnal sona ram, richpal mirdha, jyoti mirdha, ramrarayan dudi, mahipal maderna sareekhe nami giraami netaa rahe
 In the political struggle of gehlot-raje, the Jats lost the identity of Ashok Gehlot of Congress and later Vasundhara Raje in 2003, whether entering the politics of Rajasthan, whether Jat or Rajput or Brahmin controlled the political existence of these influential castes
 jo netaa vasundhara raaje or ashok gahalot ke liye chunauti bana unka raajnneetik vajood yaa to khatm kar diya gaya yaa phir ve haashiye par chale gaye
 Examples of the Mirdha family, Maderna family, Ola, Ghanshyam Tiwari or Jaswant Singh Jasol are evident
 jat samudaay ke diggaj netaaon kii dhamak rajya or centre main to thi lekin ye kabhi apana mukhyamantri nahin banavaa paae
 In such a situation, the ambitious youth section of the Jat community, mainly farmers, who see their future in the job due to the not being profitable farming, got angry
 gauratlab he ki gahalot sarkaar ke khilaaf yuvaaon ke gusse kii lahar par savaar hokar vasundhara raaje mukhyamantri to ban gayi, lekin 50 lakh naukari dene kaa vaada puraa nahin kar pain
 Now to gather these youths especially the Jat community, Independent MLA from Khivansar Hanuman Beniwal is visiting the entire state
 rajasthan main tisare morche kii dhamkarajasthan kii raajnneeti main nagaur, sikar, jhunjhanu, bharatpur or jodhpur ko ek tarah se jat belt kaha jaataa he
 The Jat community has influence in about 60 seats
 hanuman beniwal ko jis tarah se jat yuvaaon kaa samarthan mil rahaa he
 This society wants to see Beniwal as the first Jat CM of Rajasthan
 beniwal kii badhati siyaasi takat ko dekhte hue hi bijepi ke alag hokar nai party banane vaale ghanashyam tiwadi ne beniwal ko samarthan dene kii baat kahi he
 He has said that Bharat Vahini Party will contest all the seats in Rajasthan
 lekin jin siton par beniwal ke pratyaashee kii jeet sunishchit hogi un siton par unka samarthan kiya jayega
 Tiwari has also said that he will decide the candidates of his party only after talking to Beniwal
 idhar apane mewar daure par vidhayak hanuman beniwal ne kaha he ki rajasthan main congress-bijepi ke khilaaf tisare morche kaa gathan kiya jayega
 Also, a new party will be announced at the huge rally in Jaipur
 beniwal ne yuvaaon ko 5000 rupaya berogari bhatta dene kii baat kahi he
 Which is in response to the unemployment allowance of Rs 3500 declared by the Congress
 beniwal kaa daawa he ki tisare morche ke samarthan ke bina kisi kii sarkaar nahin banegi
 However, it has to be seen now that what camel of the Jat politics sits on the appeal of Hanuman Beniwal to end the political vacuum that has persisted for decades

 Congress in the mood to surround the government
 On the other hand, the Congress has already made its stand clear that in this session, the BJP will surround the government on many issues like Jai Shah's son Amit Shah's son and the Rafale Agreement
 sansad satr ko lekar sarkaar kii ore se sarvadaleey baithak kii parampara kaaphi puraani he
 Through this, the government talks about the support of the leaders of the opposition in running the parliament smoothly
 saath hi yah aashwaasan detii he ki vah kisi bhi mudde par charchaa karne ko taiyaar hai
 Earlier, the Congress had strongly criticized the government for shortening the Winter Parliament session starting on Friday and not holding it between the Gujarat elections
 usne sarkaar par aarope bhi lagaaya ki usne gujarat chunaav ko dekhte hue sheetakaaleen satr ko samay par nahin bulaayaa
 It also alleged that the government was avoiding issues related to corruption
 jawaab main sarkaar ne safai di ki yah pehali dfa nahin he
 Even before this, the Parliament session was carried back and forth
 congress ke samay main bhi kai satr tarikhon ko aage peeche kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The Modi government says that it is ready to discuss any issue in Parliament and will not back down on any issue
 sarkaar teen talaak ko lekar sheetakaaleen satr main ek bill laane ja rahi he

 The incident occurred in Rohtak, the chief minister's home district, where a woman accused two boys of rape

 input:ians Patna Sahib and Pataliputra were divided into two Lok Sabha constituencies for the first time in the 2009 Loksabha Elections
 
 
 2009 main ranjan prasad yadav jediu se chunaav jite the
 
 tab unhone bijepi ke ramkripal yadav ko 23 hajaar se kuch adhik voton se haraaya tha
 But in the 2014 Modi wave, Ramkripal won this seat and defeated rjd's Misa Yadav
 ramkripal ko 39
 If 16 percent votes were received, Misa Yadav got 35
 04 fisadi vot or jeet kaa antar sirf 41 hajaar voton kaa tha
 But in 2014, JDU was separated and was not part of any alliance
 ab vah bijepi ke saath he to jediu ke 9
 93 percent of the vote will also have to be associated with the BJP
 aise main patliputra loksabhaa kshetra main bijepi or jediu voton kii kul sankhya 49
 It is 09 percent
 vahiin duusari ore patliputra loksabhaa kshetra main sipiimail ko bhi 5
 27 percent votes were received
 is lihaaj se mahagathbandhan ke sabhi dalon yani argedy,sipimes,congress kaa vot jod den to unke kul voton kii sankhya 43
 Reaches 26 percent
 is baar bhi ramkripal yadav or misa yadav maidan main hai
 This battle is also interesting because Ramkripal was at one time a disciple and soldier of Lalu
 yahi nahin ramkripal yadav argedy ke tikat par bihar ke vidhaan parishad ke sadsy rahe
 He was a member of the Lok Sabha thrice and once came on the RJD ticket by winning the Rajya Sabha
 magar 2014 main jab lalu yadav ne patliputra kii seat ramkripal yadav ko na dekar misa yadav ko de di to ramkripal yadav ne naaraaz hokar bijepi kaa daaman tham liya or misa bharti ko haraa diya
 This is the reason that this time also this seat of Pataliputra remains a seat of prestige for the Lalu Yadav family
 yahaan par chunaav prachaar ke dauraan tejasvi yadav ne aarakshan kaa mudda uthaa diya he or pichhadi jatiyon ko yah kah rahe hai ki yadi kendra main modi sarkaar ai to pichhadon kaa aarakshan khatm ho jayega
 Pataliputra Lok Sabha seat is a Yadav dominated area
 yahaan 5 lakh yadav, saadhe chaar lakh bhoomihaar, 3 lakh rajput or kurmi or dedh lakh brahman matadaata hai
 Pataliputra Lok Sabha constituency consists of 6 assembly constituencies covering areas like Danapur, Maner, Phulwari, Pathanathi, Paliganj and Vikram
 isamen se phulwari or masauthi rirjav kshetra hai
 Of these assemblies, the RJD is occupied by Maner, Draft and Pali
 jabaki danapur par bijepi, phulwari par jadyu or vikram par congress kaa kabja he
 That is, out of 6 Vidhan Sabha, 4 are controlled by Mahagathbandhan and two by BJP-JDU
 yahi vajah he ki 2014 kii modi lahar main mahaj 41 hajaar se jeetne vaale ramkripal ke liye misa yadav badi chunauti bani hui hai
 And this is what has made this election thorny and interesting
 congress madhya pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav membespaase haath milakar bijepi ko maat dene kaa sapana dekh rahi thi

 Jayas asked the Congress for 25 seats
 The president told that he has met state president Kamal Nath, party's state in-charge Deepak Babaria and Digvijay Singh for an alliance with Congress in Madhya Pradesh

 Shivraj did not talk to Rahul, he did offer, however, with Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Dr
 heeralaal alaava kii na ko baat hui he or na hi koi mulaakaat hui he
 While he asked state leaders to meet Rahul
 dilachasp baat ye he ki alaava ko 5 agast ko shivaraj singh chouhan ne aamantrit kiya tha, jahaan unhen bijepi main shaamil hone kaa prastaav diya gaya tha
 However, he refused to join the BJP

 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne mangalvaar ko pashchim bengal kii pichhali vampanthi sarkaar ko maujuuda trinmul sarkaar se behatar bataaya
 While addressing a public meeting in Bardaman, Amit Shah lashed out at the Mamata Banerjee government
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki yahaan vipakshi dalon kii reliyon main aane vaale logon ke haath kaat liye jate hens or unhen cigareton se jalaayaa jaataa he, lekin saath hi daawa bhi kiya ki jitna zyada atyaachaar kiya jayega, rajya main camel utani hi majbootee se khilegaa
 Although this gathering was less crowded than the previous rally in West Bengal, Amit Shah thundered as before and said that if the government encourages violence, it will be responded to
 shah ne logon se bhi poocha ki kya ve parivartan ke liye taiyaar hai, or phir unase kaha ki agar ve vikaas chaahate hai, to unhen yahaan bhi bijepi kii sarkaar banavaani hogi
 Amit Shah once again accused the Mamata government of saving the accused in connection with the Bardaman bomb blast through the Bardaman rally
 isse pehle amit shah ne ek raily kolkata shahar main pichley saal kii thi
 In Bardaman's rally, Shah also highlighted the achievements of the central government, 10 times the reduction in prices of petrol and diesel

 This time, like the last election, there is no doubt among the people that voting for the Aam Aadmi Party will destroy their votes

 Kiran Bedi's joining the BJP may have given moral strength to the party, but only time will tell how much crowd Kiran Bedi can gather in her first election rally and also time will tell whether Kiran Bedi will be able to break Kejriwal The Right now it is time, which is lacking at this time

 The reason is that the Liberhan Ayodhya Commission of Inquiry report is rich in its poor language, complicity and naming all the well-known villains of the Sangh Parivar, but is clearly full of flaws (including 'pseudo-liberal' Atal Bihari The name of Vajpayee is definitely surprising, which is probably because Justice M

 aparaadhiyon ko gahare bhagava rang main rangakar ayog ne hataash rajnatik hinduon ko unka ram lautaa diya he
 Liberhan's lengthy article has provided a chance for otherwise staunch and lost BJP leaders to become victims again in this era of secularism

 Discussion is the only solution - with almost half of the monsoon session going through without any special work, the government said that the "respectable path" for the Congress would be that Lalit Modi's alleged foreign minister Sushma Swaraj " He should be ready to hold a discussion in the House on the issue of help

 somvaar ko sarvadaleey is baithak se pehle congress sansadeey dal kii bhi meeting hone ja rahi he, jisamen party adhyaksh sonia gandhi modi sarkaar ko gherne kii ranneeti taiyaar karengi
 The Congress has been rejecting the demand, the government meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party General Unit is taking place before the all-party meeting, when the government and BJP are giving no indication of accepting the demand for the resignation of Sushma Swaraj, Vasundhara Raje and Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 congress or vam sahit vipakshi dal jahaan‘istipha nahin, tab tak koi charchaa nahin’par ade hue hai, vahiin bijepi netaa or mantri lagaataar yah kah rahe hai ki koi istipha nahin hoga or sarkaar vipaksh ko ‘upakrit’ karne nahin ja rahi he
