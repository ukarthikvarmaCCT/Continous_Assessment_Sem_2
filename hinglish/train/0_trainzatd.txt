 Tanwar also questioned Dahiya, but got rewarded for being close to Hooda
 itnaa hi nahin hooda duusare netaaon ke kshetra main bhi apane kai samarthakon ko tikat dilaane main safal rahe hai
 For example, Somveer Singh from Loharu seat and Randeep Meghdra from Badhra seat have got tickets
 yah ilaaka kiran choudhary kaa mana jaataa he, jinke hooda se rishte jagajaahir hai

 aamtaur par daant saaf karne ke liye istemaal hone vaale toothpaste kaa chayan ham uski keemat athwa uske vigyapanon ko dekhakar karte hai, lekin danta visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki galat toothpaste kaa chunaav hamaare swasthya ke liye hanikaarak sabit ho saktaa he
 Dentist Dr
 ankit bahal kaa kahana he ki kathor disergent vaale toothpaston ke istemaal se munh main chhaale ho sakate hai
 Also, if children swallow toothpaste made for adults, it can prove dangerous for them
 unhone kaha ki daanton kii mile saaf karne ke liye toothpaste main kuch rasinic padaarthon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 This can cause problems in people who are sensitive to these substances
 unhone kaha ki toothpaste lete samay is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie ki use kis aayu ke vyakti ko istemaal karnaa he
 Homes that have toothpaste only to be used by adults may choose toothpastes that are specifically designed for adult people
 vayaskon ke toothpaston main dhumrapaan karne vaale logon ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaye gaye toothpaste athwa munh ko tarotaaja banane vaale jail toothpaste shaamil hai
 Dr
 bahal ne kaha ki agar toothpaste aise ghar ke liye lenaa he jahaan uskaa istemaal vayaskon ke saath hi bacchon ko bhi karnaa he to iske chunaav main vishesh satarkta baratani chahie
 In such a situation, you should choose a toothpaste that suits every age group
 danta visheshgy da
 According to Sudhir Kulkarni, toothpastes use sodium fluoride and many other substances to clean teeth and to make them shiny
 aise padaarthon vaale toothpaste bade bacchon ke liye to thik hai, jinhone brush ke dauraan toothpaste ko andar nahin lenaa sikh liya he, lekin yah chote bacchon ke liye thik nahin kyonki ve iskaa swaad lene ke chakkar main kai baar ise andar ghont lete hai
 He said that if adults do not want to use toothpaste made for children, then they should also take children's toothpaste along with their favorite toothpaste so that children can use the same toothpaste
 toothpaste lete samay is baat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana chahie ki aapke daanton main kisi tarah kii samasya he
 You should choose the same toothpaste which is helpful in removing your problem

 Upset over the defeat of Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), captain Virat Kohli has admitted that his team will now have to adopt a 'watch and wait' policy to know the possibility of making it to the IPL-7 playoffs
 team aaarasibi ne apana pichhlaa match sunrisers hyderabad ke khilaaf khelaa tha, jisamen vah saat wicket se haar gai thi
 RCB currently sit fifth in the table and have two more matches to play, but a win in the next two matches will not qualify them for the playoffs, as their fate will now depend on the performance of other teams as well
 viraat kohli ne match ke baad hue samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ''is match se pehle sab kuch hamaare haath main tha
 
 
 We should have won this match to keep things under our control, but now we have to follow the 'watch and wait' policy
 
 
 hamen anya tiimon ke pradarshan par bhi gaur karnaa hoga
 
 
 Hopefully we will get favorable results, but this is not a good situation
 
 
 '' Virat Kohli said, "we were in a similar situation last year, but we played a good cricket and got into a situation where things were under our control, and we could decide how we should play the last three matches
" Huh
 
 
 lekin is saal ham apni lay barkaraar nahin rakh paae
 
 
 '' aaarasibi ke captain viraat kohli isliye bhi niraash the ki unki acchhee pari team ke kaam nahin ai
 He scored 67 runs in this match, but despite this the team RCB could not score big
 unhone kaha, ''aakhir main ham apni ranneeti ke anusaar khel nahin dikhaa paae or hamen uskaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa
 
 
 Sunrisers played well in the second innings
 
 
 hamane bhi acchhee vaapasi kii, lekin ant acha nahin kar paae
 
 
 i mean when we needed 22 runs in two overs, we were in a good position, and we should have defended it
 
 
 yadi aap yorker nahin kar sakate to phir aakhri overon main aapako nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa
 
 
 '' viraat kohli ne kaha ki gendbaaji vibhaag kii kamajoriyon ke kaaran aaarasibi ko sunrisers ke khilaaf match ganvaana padaa
 He said, "in T20, the match is short and you don't need only two good overs, but four good overs are needed to return to the match
 
 
 meraa maananaa he ki hamane 50 pratishat acchhee genden kin, lekin iske baad hamane un kshetron main gend kii, jahaan nahin kerani chahie thi
 
 
 And in the end, we lost the match

" lata mangeshkar kaa hindi filmi geeton ke liye vahi yogadan he jo gaalib kaa urdu adab ke liye or makabool fida hossain kaa painting ke liye

 But there is a lot more to Lata's story
 unhone 1940 ke dashak main 13 saal kii umr main filmon main kadam rakhaa
 His motive then was to help a family suffering after the death of his father
 unhone tab ek aise film udyog main apni jagah banaai jahaan asahmati ke swar zyada hote the or jahaan pitrusatta haaavee thi
 He started a new phase of change by getting trained playback singers like him instead of singing actors himself
 jab unki 'khyaati uthaae ja unke sitam' (andaaj) or 'aayega aane vaala' (mahal) jaise gaanon ke baad aasmaan chune lagi to na keval unki aawaaj kaa jaadu failane laga balki badlaav kii bayaar bahane lagi
 He also struggled with royalty for playback singers and a separate Filmfare Award for him
 jab unki urdu ko lekar sawaal uthe to unhone apane liye ek shikshak rakhaa
 She would practice the songs until her talafuj was fixed
 isi abhyaas ne unhen parfect bana diya

 When the train accident happened, he resigned

 Otherwise, he would also be called a fugitive
 bhagwaan ram ko mata kaikeyi ne 14 saal kaa vanvaas de diya
 The public was with him
 phir bhi vah vanvaas par gaye
 The BJP people also called him an absconder

 Was from UP kisko vot doge

 kyon doge

 is desh ke media ke kuch logon ne desh ke saath gaddari kii he
 Lie has propagated that Narendra Modi ji is a development man

 jhooth bol rahaa hum to media vaale bataa den
 If Modi was a development man, i would stand with him
 saamaanya netaa hote, tab bhi virodh nahin karata
 But after what you have seen, it becomes necessary to protest
 agar kisaanon ne modi ko vot de diya, to aapaki jameen nahin bachegi
 Modi ji took away the farmers' land and gave it to Adani and Ambani
 ye karpshan kar apana dhandha chalaate hai
 His business is worth millions of crores
 ek gaanv main gaya main
 Farmers told there
 ek kisaan bolaa, saadhe saat acre jameen thi
 First company goons came
 phir sarkaar ai
 Stripped the ground paanch saal ho gaye, ek paisa nahin mila
 Told you in another village
 50 lakh acre kaa jameen rate tha
 The government gave compensation of 1 lakh acres by snatching land
 or ye jameen modi ji ne adani ko ek rupee meter ke hisaab se di
 Uncle Modi does not think of Adani Modi
 kuch na kuch to gadabad hui hogi
 The farmers of Gujarat are shedding tears of blood
 modi kii sarkaar banane se pehle sabsidi milti thi, tractor par, thraishar par
 Such situation was created by removing the subsidy that Modi ji is forced to sell the land

 Just before the Lok Sabha elections, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has started his preparations and he is currently on a tour of Rae Bareli
 raibareli main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue unhone piem modi par hamalaa bolaa or kaha ki piem modi ne achche din kaa vaada kiya tha, vah achche din kahaan he? unhone kaha ki chaukeedaar ne sabit kar diya ki vah chor he
 Attacking PM Modi in Rae Bareli, Rahul Gandhi said that the watchman fooled everyone, now a new slogan has come
 log kehete hai chaukeedaar chor ho gaya he
 Narendra Modi means hate
 vah nafrat failaane kaa king he
 How the watchman became a thief in four and a half years is a big question
 kisaan apane paseene se fasal ugaae lekin piem modi or unki sarkaar unka karj maaf nahin karenge
 Rahul Gandhi said that you remember this, do not give one soldier of yours
 
 
 ek nahin ab teen sipaahi hai or aapke liye desh main kaam kar rahe hai
 He further said that i have told Priyanka that she will come here to see you as soon as the general secretary becomes
 unhone aage kaha ki sarkaar kahati he hamaare paas paisa nahin he
 We have waived the debt of farmers in MP, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh within ten days
 hamanen chunaav main vaada kiya tha vah do din ke andar hi puraa kar diya
 PM Modi has forgiven three and a half lakh crores of 15 to 20 industrialists
 wo paisa aapkaa tha
 He was the money of Amethi, UP, and other youth of the country
 narendra modi ji ke saath sathganth karke udyogpati apana karja maaf karaate hai
 It takes 35 thousand crores rupees to run MNREGA in the whole country, PM Modi spent one year of MNREGA money in the name of Nariv Modi
 vah 30 hajaar karod rupee lekar bhaag gaya
 Rahul Gandhi also surrounded the Modi government on Rafael and said that the government has committed corruption in the Rafale case

 parrikar kehete hai hamen kuch nahin pataa
 That is, without asking the Ministry of Defense, PM Modi made the biggest deal in the world
 unhone apane se hi rafel kii keemat badali
 He further said that the CBI director says that i will investigate
 chaukeedaar ne chori kii main jaanch karuunga
 But PM Modi writes the order at half past one in the night to get the CBI director out
 unka offis ratorat sil kiya jaataa he
 PM Modi openly committed theft during the day
 jo karrwai karne ja rahaa he use dedh baje raat main nikaala jaataa he
 The Supreme Court said it was wrong
 phir se use diarector banaaya jaataa he
 The meeting is called again within two hours
 aakhir itani jaldi kyon
 Because the watchman is a thief
 yah har yuva samaj gaya he
 On demonetisation, Rahul Gandhi said that during the period of demonetisation, did Anil Ambani and Mehul Chowk stood? Only honest people, farmers, laborers, women were standing in that line
 aapke jeb se paise nikaalkar narendra modi ne sidhe neerav modi va anil ambani ko diya he
 The loan that was forgiven was your money
 jiesti main hamane ek jiesti kii baat kahi thi lekin inhone paanch jiesti lagaai
 Because they had to be brokered
 aaj chote udyog auki dukandaar mar rahe he
 The economy of India shook itself
 yah chote kaarobaariyon ko khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 It wants all of you to work for Anil Ambani
 aapako ek din main naukari se nikaal diya jaae
 Had said to give employment to two crores
 lekin kisi ko rojgaar nahin diya kaha ki pakora becho
 Rahul Gandhi said that Modi removed the railway line, food park
 empi main chhattisgarh main kaam shuru ho gaya he
 Here we are setting up a potato factory near the farmers' farm, a tomato processing factory near the tomato field
 maine priyanka or jyotiraditya se kaha ki hamen upi main agle chunaav main bijepi ko haraana he
 i will never say BJP free India
 lekin ham aapako chunaav main haraayenge
 We do not do politics of hate
 hamen apni jagah banani he isliye ham apni ladaai ladenge
 The Congress party will play vigorously on the front foot everywhere
 upi vidhansabha chunaav main yahaan congress kii sarkaar banegi
 We will fight with full force in the Lok Sabha
 unhone aage kaha ki main amethi kii janata se kahana chahta hum ki aapkaa hamaara paariwarik rishta he, na kii raajnneetik
 i want to tell you that three of your soldiers are working for the country
 ham apni sarkaar banate hi aapako food park va anya jo bhi chijen aap chahen vah ham denge
 Modi lies in the name of God
 vah bhagwaan kaa naam lete hai or jhooth bolte hai
 i say the food park in Amethi will be 101 percent
 aapkaa vikaas kaa kaam ham karenge
 We will do the work that Modi ji and Yogi have stopped for the past five years
 bas agali baar ek kaam karnaa jab bijepi ke log jab aae to unase kahana he aapkaa piem ne 30 hajaar karod rupee kii chori kii he

 Due to illegal smuggling of liquor from neighboring state of Haryana, the capital of the country is suffering at least 200 to 250 crores every year
 haryana main dilli ke mukaable sharaab bahut sasti he
 Due to the high price of alcohol in Delhi, people smuggling large quantities of alcohol from Haryana
 khaas taur par shaadi, party va anya saamaajik kaaryakramon ke liye badi maatra main taskari hoti he
 The large-scale illegal smuggling is due to inadequate settlement of security along the border and lack of effective surveillance in Haryana
 haryana main sharaab kaa vyavsaay privet haathon main he, jis kaaran sharaab mafia aasaani se lakhon bottle sharaab dilli main taskari karke le aate hai or uske baad unhen dilli main oonchi keemat par bechakar tagada munafa kamaate hai
 Due to this smuggling game, Haryana is also losing tax and revenue
 dilli ke aabkaari vibhaag ne ab is avaidh taskari ko rokane ke liye haryana sarkaar se madad maangi he
 In the current financial year (2012-13), Delhi Government's Excise Information Unit conducted raids at 700 places, including banquet halls, farmhouses and restaurants and bars
 is chhapemari main 1
 25 lakh Baatla Baalis have also been seized, which were trafficked from Haryana
 adhikariyon ke anusaar yah to ek bade racket kaa chota sa hissaa he jo haath main aayaa he
 According to a senior government official, the main reason for the smuggling is the huge difference in the excise duty on alcohol between the two states
 dilli main jahaan aabkaari shulk 60 pratishat he vahiin haryana main shulk kaaphi kam he or sharaab kii keemat bhi
 Apart from this, the liquor business in Haryana is in the hands of private traffickers, while in Delhi the business is under government control
 35-40 adhikariyon kaa aabkaari vibhaag taskari ke vibhinn kendron kii pahchaan karne main sakasham nahin he
 According to one official, 'we cannot put dozens of officers on every border and often smugglers include criminals who carry weapons with them
 do-teen bina hathiyaaron ke adhikari hathiyaaron se las un aparaadhiyon se kaise bhid sakate hai
 'it is also not the police's priority to check the smuggling of liquor
 ek senior adhikari ke anusaar, ‘aksar pulisavaale ghoose lekar sharaab kii taskari karne waalon ko nazarandaaj kar dete hai
 It is not at all the case that local policemen are not aware of smuggling, but they allow them to enter Delhi for a few thousand rupees per vehicle
 haa ye jarur he ki tyoharon ke maukon par ve record ke liye unamem se kuch taskaron ko giraftaar va gadiyon ko jabt main lete hai
 ' bhartiya mul ke karan abhi sirf 14 saal ke hai, lekin unhone apni pratibha se desh kaa naam roshan kiya he

 But a class in this region is still forced to bear the brunt of inequality

 On June 23, Gokulraj, a 21-year-old student of engineering, came to the temple with his female friend from where he was abducted by Yuvraj's servant, the leader of a group of local domineering people
 agle din gokulraj kaa shav erode jile ke najadik palliplaayam main rail kii patariyon par mila tha
 Local people say that the accused first cut Gokulraj's head and separated it and then threw the body on the tracks to make the case a suicide
 is ghatana ko ek maah ho chukaa he lekin maamle kaa mukhya aaropee yuvaraj ab bhi police kii jad se baahar he
 He belongs to Gondar caste and this caste has a lot of dominance in this area whereas Gokulraj was from Dalit caste
 usne keesar college of technology se haal hi main grajuation kiya tha or uski mahila dost bhi isi college kii chaatra thi
 The girl was from the Gondar caste
 yah pichley saal ke ant kii ghatana he jab tamil lekhak perumal murugan ko hinduvadi or jativaadee sthaneey sanghathanon ne kai hakraton tak daraaya-dhamkaaya tha, jiske baad ve tiruchengod se bhaagane ke liye majaboor ho gaye the
 These organizations alleged that Ardhanarishwar and Gondar caste have been insulted in Murugan's recent novel Matorubagan (ardhanari)
 is ghatana main bhi samudaay ke anya netaaon samet yuvaraj kaa haath bataaya jaataa he
 The incident of Gokulraj's murder has revived the 2012 murder of another Dalit youth, Elavarasan
 uske shav ko bhi patariyon par phenk diya gaya tha
 The crime of Elavarasan was that he married a woman of Vanniyar caste equal to Gondar
 darasal, gondar kii tarah vanniar jati pichhadaa varg main hi aati he lekin jameendaar hone ke naate inkaa ilaake main dabadabaa he
 Though there is a history of anti-brahmin and upper caste campaigns in Tamil Nadu, but crimes against Dalits have always happened here
 rajya ke uttari or dakshini jile iske liye kukhyat hai haalanki 1980 ke dashak tak aise maamle prakaash main nahin aae the
 According to some reports, the locals here have settled in western Tamil Nadu, considered comparatively peaceful, although Gondar and Vanniyar are also majority here
 gokulraj ke bade bhai or ejineering graduate 24 varshiya kalai selvan ne india today se kaha, “ve hamen or hamaare (dalit) samudaay ko daraana chaahate hai
 The assassination of Gokulraj is a warning to all educated people who want to get ahead in life and want to bond with women of influential castes
 ” kalai samet tiruchengod ke kuch or dalit jatiyon ke log bataate hai ki kis tarah gokulraj kii hatya ke baad soshal netwarking cites par “daliton ko unki sahi aukaat bataao” jaise sandeshon kii bharmaar thi or is tarah ke sandesh kongu naam se aae the
 This name is commonly used by the people of Gondar caste

 Dalits constitute about 20% of the population of 21 crore

 Despite the anti-caste discrimination movement of Periyar, there is no one here to raise the voice of the downtrodden downtrodden for centuries

 Says Katir, “the problem of caste discrimination is even more complex in western Tamil Nadu
 yahaan kaa dalit arunatatiyar samudaay hameshaa se khamosh rahaa he or isiilie use or bhi zyada dabaaya jaataa he
 This is the reason why there was never any voice against untouchability here
 ” erode jile ke vellakoli main rahane vaale lekhak devibharati kehete hai, “chuaachhut yahaan lambey samay se chali aa rahi he lekin daliton ke saath hinsak vaaradaaten kaaphi bad gai hai
 And it is getting political as well
 ”dalit vidwaan stallin rajangam kehete hai, “hwotsap par ek audio massej main yuvaraj ko kehete suna ja saktaa he ki usne jo kuch bhi kiya he (kathith taur par gokulraj kii hatya) vah samudaay kii behatari ke liye hi kiya he

 According to Thol Tirumavalavan, the leader of Vidutalai Chirutigal Kachi (VCK), an influential Dalit party in the area, many casteist organizations are following the ideology of Ramdas
 ve kehete hai, “daliton se ghrinaa kii raajnneeti hi piemke kii ranneeti he
 In this way they garner support for their caste
 ”unki baat kaaphi had tak sahi he
 In 2012-13, Pongalur Manikandan of the then radical group Kongu Velala Gondargal Peravai (KVGP) waged a major campaign against inter-caste marriages in the western region of the state
 haalanki manikandan kehete hai, “kai jawan ladke mahilaon ko apane jaal main fansaa kar unase alag hone ke liye unke pariwaron se paisa maangate hai
 Our campaign is against such people
 ham antarjaateey vivaahon ke khilaaf nahin hai
 "later Manikandan was removed from his post by the KVGP and now he is leading a farmers' campaign in the state
 unka daawa he ki yah abhiyaan jatigat bandhanon se upar he or ve sabhi samudaayon ke kisaanon ke liye kaam karte hai
 Local Gondar leader and AIADMK MLA U
 taniarasu apane samudaay par lage sabhi aaropon ko sire se khaarij kar dete hai
 According to him, the incidents of assassination of Gokulraj, intimidation of the writer and attack are actually the hand of any inner people who want to bring the administration into disrepute
 ve kehete hai, “hamaara samudaay is tarah kii har koshish kaa virodh karegaa or pashchimi tamilnadu main saamaajik sauhardra banaae rakhane kii koshish karegaa
 "on the other hand, the district administration of Namakkal is silent on the question of what steps the administration has taken to stop the violence related to caste discrimination which is continuously increasing
 uskaa sirf itnaa hi kahana he ki adhikari donon samudaayon ke bich baithken yojit karvaa rahe hai taaki unke bich vyaapt tanaav ko khatm kiya ja sake
 Chitra, the mother of deceased Gokulraj, who struggled day and night for the upbringing of two sons after the death of her husband a decade ago, was rewarded when her two sons became engineers
 lekin aaj ve is baat par afsos kar rahi hai ki kaash! prashasan ne aisi ghatnaon ko rokane ke kadam pehle uthaa liye hote
 This changed the electoral map and the BJP won 104 out of 222 seats in Karnataka, with the majority being from the strong rural strongholds of mumbai-karnataka region in the north, Old Mysuru and coastal Karnataka in the south
 congress se do fisadi vot kam hasil karne ke baavjood lingayaton, daliton, adivaasiyon or obisi ke bich bhaajapa ne majboot paith banaai or 2013 kii tulana main usne shandaar pradarshan kiya, jabaki pichhali baar guton main vibhajit party sirf chalis siten hi jeet saki thi
 However, its seats fell slightly short of the majority figure
 2018 main is bhagava ufaan se congress ko bada jhatka laga
 In a strong anti-incumbency wave, the Siddaramaiah government lost 44 seats compared to the 122 seats it had got in the 2013 assembly elections and was ousted from power
 beshak, pichhali baar kii tulana main congress kaa vot pratishat 36
 From 6 per cent to 38 per cent, his seats were reduced to 78 as his vote spread across the state was the same
 janata dal (secular), jisane sarkaar banane kii koshish main chunaav ke baad congress se gathbandhan kiya, uski sthiti 2013 jaisi hi rahi or teen siten ganvaakar vah 37 par atak gaya
 But it lost two per cent of the votes and 20 of 2013
 2 fisadi kii tulana main 2018 main uske vot 18
 3 percent remain
 bhaajapa ko badi badhat nae ilaakon main mili uski paith or 2013 vaali apni khoi jameen hasil karne se mili
 It was successful in preserving its Lingayat stronghold, which accounted for 17 per cent of the important votes, despite the Siddaramaiah government trying to divide the community into religious minority status with the help of Veerashaiva saints
 takreeban 61 fisadi lingayat vot bhaajapa ko mili, jabaki congress ko 20 fisadi or jad (es) ko sirf nau fisadi
 The Congress vote of the Lingayat community fell from 48 per cent in 2013 to 20 per cent
 15 fisadi vaale vokkaliga vot main se bada hissaa 63 fisadi ke kareeb jad (es) ke khate main gaya, jabaki bhaajapa or congress ko kramshah 19 fisadi or 11 fisadi vot hi mili
 The BJP gained a resounding edge in the obcs, Dalits and Adivasi communities, which rendered Ahinda (an abbreviation for minorities, backward classes and Dalits) redundant, a community alliance that Siddaramaiah cautiously pursued
 asal main congress ko hue nuksaan kaa phayda bhaajapa ko hua
 In addition, it also wrested 20 of the 22 seats won by independents in 2013
 mumbai-karnataka, tateey karnataka or puraane mysuru main congress kaa safaya ho gaya
 However, the party was successful in maintaining its Muslim base and the support of the Kuruba community, which also brings Siddaramaiah himself
 uskaa daliton, adivaasiyon or obosi kaa samarthan buree tarah khisak gaya
 Congress got more votes on reserved seats, but it could win only 12 seats as compared to 16 seats BJP got
 jad (es) ne puraane mysuru main vokkaliga samudaay main paith banaae rakhi, lekin usne muslim vot congress ke haath ganvaa die
 The Congress suffered the most in the mumbai-karnataka region with 50 seats
 party ne 2013 main is kshetra par kabja karte hue 31 siten jiti thim
 This time she could barely win 17 seats
 vahiin bhaajapa ne 2013 kii 13 siton ke mukaable doguna se bhi adhik 30 siten jeetin
 The hyderabad-karnataka region, which has 40 seats, won three times the BJP with 15 seats compared to the previous one
 inamen se adhikansh siten 2013 main nirdaleeyon ne jiti thim
 With 21 seats, the Congress managed to retain its broad base, getting just two seats less than in 2013
 jad (es) pichhali baar kii paanch siton main se chaar bachaane main safal hua
 Old Mysuru, which has 62 important seats, witnessed a triangular contest between JD (S), BJP and Congress
 buniyadi taur par samrudh vokkaliga samudaay ke samarthan ke dam par jad (es) ne chaar siton se apana aankada 27 par pahunchaa diya
 At the same time, Congress lost one-third of the seats and its seats were reduced to 20 from 30 seats in 2013
 bhaajapa jisane 2013 main sirf paanch siten hi jiti thim, is baar 16 siten jeetne main safal hui, jinamein se adhikansh tateey kshetra kii hai
 He also captured Hassan, the stronghold of the Deve Gowda family
 devegoda parivaar iske liye congress ko doshi maan rahaa he
 The BJP won a landslide victory in heavily polarized coastal Karnataka
 yahaan usne 19 main se 16 siten hasil kar leen
 In 2013, it won just three seats
 congress, jisane 2013 main ullekhneey pradarshan karte hue 13 siten jiti thim, is baar teen siton par simat gai
 In the Bangalore region, where elections were held for 26 of the 28 seats, there was not much change in the situation of the parties compared to 2013, although the areas definitely changed
 bhaajapa ne 2013 kii 11 siton par kabja barkaraar rakhaa
 The Congress won 13 seats and gained one seat
 jad (es) ko do siten milin, jo 2013 se ek kam he
 The magic of BJP did not work here
 siddharamaiya ke ahinda saamaajik gathbandhan, jisane 2013 main congress ko satta dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi, is baar uski dhajjiyaan ud gayi
 This alliance worked only for Muslims and Kuruba votes
 matdaan baad surveykshan ke aankadon kaa vishleshan dikhaata he ki daliton or obisi ne congress kaa saath chhodkar bhaajapa kaa daaman tham liya
 12 in total population
 5 fisadi kii hissedari vaale musalamaanon main se bada hissaa 78 fisadi congress ke saath rahaa, jabaki 11 fisadi ne jad (es) ke paksh main vot kiya or sirf paanch fisadi ne bhaajapa ke
 Congress got 60 per cent of the Kuruba community's vote, 27 per cent for BJP and seven per cent for JD (S)
 daliton main, jinaki kul aabaadi main 16
 There is a 2 per cent stake, 40 per cent voted for the BJP, 37 per cent voted for the Congress and 18 per cent in favor of the JD (S)
 obisi main se aadhe se adhik (52 fisadi) ne bhaajapa ko vot diya, 24 fisadi ne congress ko or 14 fisadi ne jad (es) ko
 The same story was repeated in the case of tribals, of which 44 per cent voted for BJP, 29 per cent for Congress and 16 per cent for JD (S)
 bhaajapa ne apni paith majboot kii
 Karnataka's 2018 mandate seems like a reiteration of the 2004 and 2008 assembly elections, when the BJP emerged as the single largest party
 2004 main congress or jad (es) ne chunaav baad gathbandhan banaaya tha
 Now the Governor gave the largest party BJP an opportunity to form the government and BS Yeddyurappa has also taken oath of Chief Minister

 The Large Hydron Collider (LHC) may be relaunched in August with the aim of collecting information about the origins of the universe and the mysteries of the Big Bang
 alechasi ke jariye pareekshan ke liye mashin ke jaanch kaa kaary antim charan main hai
 It is noteworthy that on 19 September 2008, due to some technical flaws in LHC, the investigation work had to be stopped

 ram janmabhumi-babari masjid jameen vivaad ke maamle main bhartiya puratathvik surveykshan (ASI) report par muslim paksh kii ore se pesh minakshi aroda ne buudhvaar ko sawaal uthaaya tha
 But today Rajiv Dhawan, appearing for the Muslim parties, said in the Supreme Court that yesterday's arguments were meaningless
 report kii pramanikta par sawaal nahin uthaaya ja saktaa
 The authenticity of the ASI report is not in doubt
 darasal minakshi aroda ne buudhvaar ko kaha tha ki eesai kii report par koi sin nahin the
 However, the Supreme Court later reported that the report was accompanied by a forwarding letter
 muslim paksh kii ore se minakshi aroda ne guuruuvaar ko eesai kii report par bahes kii
 He said that most of the period described by ASI has nothing to do with the duration of the temple (sunga, Kushan, Gupta etc
)
 justise bobade ne kaha ki aap sidhe vikramaditya par bataaie
 Justice Bhushan said there was no Vikramaditya after Gupta
 minakshi ne kaha vikramaditya kaa sambandh sunga se he, gupt se nahin
 Justice Bhushan said he belongs to the Guptas, please check again
 minakshi aroda ne kaha ki eesai ne khud sweekaar kiya tha ki usko paraton kii pahchaan karne main dikkat hui thi
 a total of 184 bones were found but only 21 by the High Court
 2 pratishat kaa hi adhyayan kiya
 He told about nine time periods based on nine civilizations
 unhone kaha ki eesai ne jin sabhyataaon ke bare main bataaya he unka mandir se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 The ASI in its report has mentioned the time period of Sunga, Kushan and Gupta
 carbon dating kaa istemaal yah pataa karne ke liye kiya jaataa he ki cheez kitni puraani he
 But ASI does not use bones, so they are not carbon dating
 minakshi aroda ne kaha ki ASI kii report main vivaadit bhoomi ke neeche khudaai main kareeb 50 khambhon par tikaa teen stareey nirmaan mila lekin sabhi manzilen alag-alag kaal main baniin
 The first probably collapsed or subsided, then the second one formed
 ASI ne sirf chaar khambhe hi expos kiye the
 Justice Bobde asked whether these pillars were to support the 50 meter wall? Meenakshi said no, the pillars were separate from the wall
 justise bobade ne poocha ki kya kahin ye byora he ki wo chaar khambhe alag kaal main or baaki 46 khambhe alag-alag kaal main bane?ayodhya maamle main ASI kii report par sawaal uthaate hue vakil minakshi aroda ne kaha ki vahaan par hathi or kisi jaanavar kii murti milane se ye nahin kaha ja saktaa ki vahaan par mandir hi hoga
 Because at that time it can also be a toy which cannot be attached to any religion
 aroda ne kaha ki vahaan par 383 architekchar avshesh mili the jisamen se 40 ko chhodkar koi bhi mandir kaa hissaa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 On the lotus mark on the rocks, Arora said that it cannot be said that it is a temple because it can also be a sacred symbol of Jain, Muslim Buddhist and Hindu religions
 is par justise bobade ne poocha ki kya masjidon main bhi camel ke nishaan hote hai? is sawaal kaa minakshi aroda ne sidhaa jawaab nahin diya, unhone kaha ki ho saktaa he
 After this, Justice Bobde sought to know the answer from Judge Justice Nazir sitting in the bench with him, whether the mosque also contains lotus marks
 justise nazeer ne kaha ki meri jaankaree main aisa nahin he
 Meenakshi Arora said that Hindus, Muslims and Buddha have been using the lotus picture
 iskaa istemaal muslim or islamic architect main hota rahaa he
 Meenakshi Arora objected to the use of the word "divine" in the ASI report
 peeth ne kaha ki in sabhi aapattiyon ko pareekshan ke dauraan visheshgyon ke saamne uthaanaa chahie tha
 Meenakshi said that it is not right to say terracotta elephants to Hindus
 ashtakonon ko bhi sirf hinduon main shaamil karnaa sweekaarya nahin he
 Justice Bobde said that the octagon is used only by Hindus
 minakshi ne kaha ki report main galat samay-nirdhaaran diya gaya he
 Different periods are given for the same thing
 ek jagah par unhone iske mughal kaal ke hone kii baat kahi to duusari jagah par wo ise madhyakaal kii shilpakruti kehete hai
 Justice Bobde said that there was mention of any animal in it
 minakshi ne kaha ki haa varah kaa
 
 hinduon ke har devtaa kii sawari hoti he
 On Varah's talk, Justice Bobde said that Varaha cannot be in the mosque
 minakshi aroda ne daleel di ki khudaai ke dauraan ASI ko jo haddiyaan mili hai un par kaatane ke nishaan the
 This may mean that people ate meat or were sacrificed at that place
 jabaki hindu paksh yahaan vaishnav mandir bataa rahaa he
 How can this be possible? The sacrifice is offered in the Shaktipeeth
 isse pehle supreme court ke chif justise ranjan gogoi ne ek baar phir kaha ki 18 aktubar tak sunwaayee khatm hona jaruri he
 If we give the verdict in four weeks, it will be like a miracle
 lekin agar sunwaayee 18 oktober tak khatm nahin hui to faisla sambhav nahin ho paaegaa
 The CJI said that till today we have ten and a half days till 18
 chif justise ne kaha ki 18 aktubar ke baad ek bhi din atirikt nahin he
 Therefore, the parties should complete the hearing within this time frame
 muslim paksh kii ore se minakshi aroda ne kaha ki aaj daleelein khatm kar dengi
 The Hindu side said that it needed three to four days to respond
 muslim paksh ke vakil rajeev dhawan se court ne poocha ki suut number 4 par bahes karne ke liye 2 din paryaapt hai? is par dhawan ne kaha ki kam hai, ham shanivaar ko bhi bahes kar sakate hai
 Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi once again cited the deadline
 unhone rahaa ki aaj sunwaayee kaa 32 waan din he or ab aap kehete hai ki aap bhi bahes karnaa chaahate hai
 We will hear until our last working day
 aap ek hi daleel yaa duusari daleel ke saath aate rahete hai
 The Chief Justice's comment came after a lawyer from a Hindu side, Nirmohi Akhara, sought 20 minutes to argue for management rights
 sijeai ne kaha ki hamane pehle hi shedul de diya he or ab isi vakt par date rahenge
 Take time out for your argument by talking to other lawyers

 jetali bole ki aaj kii jamini hakeekat ye he ki log sarkaar se niraash hai
 Kamal Nath said that Delhi is not a country

 Perhaps hearing this thing may raise eyebrows of many people
 lekin jab 'loyan' ko auskar se nahin nawaja gaya to dil ko thodi raahat mili
 However, it was sad for Dev Patel and his team that the good film missed out on getting an Oscar film
 par ek bhartiya hone ke bahaane thodi raahat bhi mili
 Deepika and Priyanka had such a fire at the Oscars party
 
 
 aakhri aisa kyon hota he ki bharat kii garibi ke naam par hi puraskaar kii ummid kii jaati he
 After all, how long will the poor children of India continue to be the subject of Hollywood films and join the Oscar race in the name of poverty
 haalanki kai log yah bhi kah sakate hai ki asal jindagi kii kahaniyaan auskar kii daud main badi baaji maarthi hai
 But is India's real life only poverty and poor children
 aise bachche yaa to ve mandir yaa masjid ke aage se chappalein churaate hai yaa phir railgadiyaan se koyala churaane kaa kaam karte hai
 Which we see in 'slumdog Millionaire' and 'lion'
 Oscars 2017 main om puri ko aise kiya gaya yaad
 
 
 For decades, the process of cashing India's poverty has not been taking a name in Hollywood
 kabhi bacchon ko koyale kii kaalikh se pota jaataa he to kabhi use apane superstar se milane kii khatir mel main duba dikhaa diya jaataa he
 The relationship between the poverty of Oscar and India is very old, Hollywood also likes India's poverty, then Mehboob Khan's 'mother India', which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film in 1958, also presented a similar picture of India
 uske baad 1989 kii 'salaam bombai' ai jisamen bombai ke sadakon par rahane vaale bacchon ke jivan kii tasviir thi
 'lion' Dev Patel, seen in Oscars with Mummy, was nominated for Ashutosh Gowariker's "lagaan" Best Foreign Language Film in 2002 and featured poor and exploited Indians playing cricket matches with the affluent British
 2009 main 'slamdog milennere' ne to kai auskar jite lekin usamen bhi kahani ek sadak ke bachche kii thi or us kirdaar ko bhi dev patel ne nibhaayaa tha
 This year the Hollywood film 'lion' also presented the same picture of India's poverty
 Osacrs ke red karpet par kaisaa tha priyanka kaa jalawakab badalegaa garibi or auskar se rishtakya bharat kaa matlab sirf garibi or muflisi hi he? yaa hollywood kaa yah maananaa he ki garibi bikati he, isliye use bhunaanaa chahie
 American author Theodore Parker wrote - As society progresses, the level of poverty also increases
 or yah baat hollywood main bakhubi dekhi ja sakati he kyonki kis tarah ek viksit cinema sirf garibi ko ek jashn kii tarah dekhtaa he or use protsaahit bhi karata he
 Confusion in the name of Best Film in Oscars 2017 One can also think that in the eyes of Hollywood even today the picture of India is of the country of snake charmers and spectacles
 ve bharat darshakon ko cash (bollywood ke kai bade sitaron ko badi filmon main maamuli role dekar) to karana chaahate hai lekin use lekar apni rudh chhavi ko hi barkaraar rakhe hue hai
 Maybe Lion's opening of the account at the Oscars would give Hollywood a chance to see other sides of India as well, and for Dev Patel to have a more solid role in the future, in which the poverty side does not dominate! britain main chikitsakon ne chetavanee jari kii he ki sharaab kii lat kishoro ko ‘riski sex’ yani asurakshit yon sambandhon kii ore dhakel rahi he jisaki vajah se anachaahe garbh or yon sankramit bimariyon kaa prasar ho rahaa he

 aamir apane tivi kaarykram 'satyamev jayate 2' ke silsile main maanjhi ke bete or bahu se milane gaye the

 aamir ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'main yahaan aakar, yahaan kii mitti ko sparsh karke vaaki khush hum, jahaan ek akele insaan ne apni ni:swaarth patibaddhta kaa itnaa bada udhaaharan pesh kiya he
 Actor and filmmaker Aamir said that his desire to see Dashrath Manjhi's village was fulfilled
 bhageerath or basanti ne aamir se baatcheet karte hue kshetreey boli magahi main kaha ki ve behad garibi main jivan bitaa rahe hai or apni sthiti sudhaarney ke liye aamir kii madad chaahate hai
 Both Bhagiratha and Basanti, who live in Dasaratha Nagar Dalit Tola in Gehlaur, are physically handicapped and somehow manage to cook mid-day meal at a local school
 aamir se milane ke baad bhageerath ne kaha, 'hamane aamir se kaha ki unhen hamaari asal kahani ko duniya ke saamne laana chahie
 Perhaps this will bring the government's attention to us and help us some
 'basanti ne kaha ki usne aamir ko apni puri vyathaa bataai lekin unhen is baat kaa dukh he ki aamir ne unka banaaya paaramparik khaanaa nahin khaaya
 It is worth mentioning that Dasharatha Manjhi of Bihar, called 'mountain Man', had prepared a 360 feet long, 30 feet wide and 30 feet high road by cutting the mountain located in his village, day and night with just the help of hammer and chisel
 2007 main cancer se unki maut ho gai thi
 Dasharatha Manjhi: History's most amazing love story goa main yojit bricks sammelan ke jariye bharat ne aatankwaad ke mudde par pakistan ko bharsak gherne kii koshish kii
 But Russia and China did not get the kind of cooperation on this issue
 bricks sammelan ke ghoshnaptr main sanyukt raashtra kii ore se pratibandhit aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke khilaaf karrwai kii baat bhi kii gai
 These organizations include jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba, which are growing on the land of Pakistan
 lekin ghoshnaptr main keval iesas or al-kaayda kaa hi naam liya gaya
 ISIS and al-qaeda threaten Russia and China, not India
 rus ne bhi nahin dikhaai dilchaspeechin kerashtrapati shi jinpingne aatankwaad kaa zikr to kiya lekin iske lakshanon or vajahon par dhyaan dene kii jarurat par bal diya
 Pakistan usually uses such words when it comes to terrorism
 duusari taraf, roosi raashtrapati vladimir putin ne to pakistan kii dharti par pal rahe aatankwaad kaa zikr tak nahin kiya
 It is being told that China has put constraints on the inclusion of names of terrorist groups like Jaish and Lashkar in the Goa manifesto
 vahiin, rus ne is masale ko lekar koi dilchaspee hi nahin dikhaai
 Whereas both Russia and China, like India, are facing the brunt of terrorism
 syria ke aatanki sanghathan kaa naam list menmaujuuda vaishvik paridrishy memrusko kisi desh kii tulana main china kii zyada jarurat he
 In such a situation, even if it is an issue related to India's security, it is not so easy for Russia to resist China's stand
 rus ne jaish-e-mohammad kaa naam ghoshnaptr main dalwane main bharat kii madad nahin kii
 But Russia managed to put the Syrian terrorist organization Jabhat al-nusra on its list
 jaish kaa haath pathankot or uri hamale main rahaa he jabaki rus syria main aatanki thikaanon par hawaii hamale jari rakhe hue he
 Pakistan is China and for both Russia and China of course, Pakistan appears as an important ally in their 'anti-jihadi game'
 syria or iraq main iesas or al-kaayda kii chulein hill chuki hai or aise main agar aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf jang aage jari rahati he to ye sanghathan apane sansadhano ko afghanistan kii ore diawart karenge
 This allows Muslim jihadists from Uygar and Russia to be located on the borders of China and Russia
 aise main china or rus ko pakistan ke sahyog kii jarurat padegi
 Confused by the help from the US, it is also interesting that China and Russia have reached the position of capturing the Afghan Taliban as of today
 rus kii ashanka is baat ko lekar badhati ja rahi he ki aatankwaadiyon ke khilaaf jang main america madad degaa yaa nahin
 Last year, when Putin visited New York on a US tour, he stressed the need to forge international alliances to wage war against ISIS
 lekin syria par hamale ke baad rus kii yah galatfahami dur ho gai ki america aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang ko lekar gambhir nahin he
 Russia began to realize that America is opportunistic
 idhar, bharat apane padosi mulk se jujh rahaa he
 India is yet to decide on whether to join the war against ISIS
 aise main bharat rus se pakistan par dabaav banane ke liye kis munh se kahe? iske alaava bharat pakistan ke khilaaf karrwai karne ke liye america se bhi haq se nahin kah saktaa he kyonki yah afghanistan main jarurat ke mutabik suraksha muhaiyaa nahin kara paa rahaa he
 India does not even have the ability to show military strength outside its borders
 aarthik jagat main bhi bharat kii dhak china or rus jaisi nahin he
 If not famous, Pakistan is effective; Pakistan on the other hand has the advantage of negative power
 isaki khufia sevaaon ne jahrile chhadam yuddh ko janm diya he jo is ilaake main khatarnaak chote chote jang ko janm de sakate hai
 It does not make Pakistan famous but it definitely makes it effective
 kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki goa ghoshnaptr main bharat kii chintaaon ko shaamil karne ke liye rus icchhuk tha lekin china ke virodh ke baad usne bhi bharat ke masale ko saport karne se haath peeche khinch liye
 As a result, the Goa Declaration did not mention state sponsored terrorism as the most important form of terrorism in the world

 Bharatiya Janata Party's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi said that now that wherever elections have been done, it seems that a new government is going to come to Delhi, now that there is election left, you should vote so much that from all over the country 300 members of BJP reach Lok Sabha and form a stronger and better Bharatiya Janata Party government
 unhone congress kii upie sarkaar ko bhrashtachar ke aaropon main gherte huye kaha ki mujhe tivi report ke madhyam se jaankaree mili he ki desh ke inakam tex department ne maance niryaat karne vaali ek company ke 60 vibhinn sthanon par chaape maare jo niryaat ke bahaane hawala kaa kaarobaar karata tha tathaa isamen kendra sarkaar ke ek mantri shaamil the or tathaa das janpath ke ek kareebi netaa shaamil the
 But the central government and its ministers are silent about this
 akbarpur loksabhaa pratyaashee devendra singh bhole ke samarthan main do ghante deree se akbarpur aaye modi ne maatr 10 minute main apni sabha samaapt kar di
 He hurriedly took the name of Congress candidate Rajaram Pal by not telling the party candidate Bhole from the stage but later corrected his mistake when other leaders intervened
 unhone bhaashan shuru karne se pehle kanpur loksabhaa pratyaashee murali manohar joshi ke pair chhukar unase aashirwad liya
 He said that the results of the Lok Sabha seats where polling has been held so far have been declared
 jiske aadhaar par ham kah sakate he ki dilli main congress kii sarkaar bachanaa mushkil he or unka janaa tay he
 Modi said that in order to maintain a strong government, i want to ask serious questions to the Congress leaders and the government will have to answer to the people of the country
 iskar vibhaag ne maance niryaat company ke 60 vibhinn thikaanon par jaanch kii thi or aise gambhir maamle saamne aaye jisaki javabdehi bahut jaruri he
 The Income Tax Department has 350 minute telephone call details of the company which is safe with the Income Tax Department
 tivi report kaa kahana he ki yah kaam niryaat kaa nahin tha balki yah ek hawala racket tha
 He alleged that apart from four ministers of the Central Government, a very close leader of 10 Janpath was involved
 yah koun mantri the inkaa naam janata ke saamne aana chaiye, das janpath ke kareebi netaa kaa kitna paisa hawala main laga he, iskaa bhi khulaasa hona chaiye or desh kii janata ko sarkaar or uske mantriyon kii asaliyat pataa chalanaa chaiye
 He said that the government and its ministers sitting in Delhi are not answering any of these questions, the ego of the Congress is on the seventh sky and it is sitting silent
 ab congress ke koyale ke daag kanpur par bhi he is liye isaki safai kerani chaiye
 Modi accused the Congress of being a promising player and said that he promised youths jobs, what happened to them
 garibi hataane kaa vaayada kiya uskaa kya hua
 The Congress only makes promises but does not fulfill them, so give a befitting reply to the Congress in this election and clear the marginalized Congress completely

 Rahul Gandhi himself has accepted this thing in Parliament, but in this video Prime Minister Modi himself is seen giving praise to the girl who called Rahul Gandhi Pappu
 haalanki ye baat hajam nahin hone vaali nahin lag rahi thi
 So, did Prime Minister Modi really bring this girl to school? Did this girl really say what is visible in this video? We investigated this viral video

 His name was Dasaratha
 unki teen raniyaan thim, jinke naam kaushalya, sumitra or kaikeyi the
 The king had four sons, namely Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna
 'aapane dekha or suna? ye bacchee to sidhe or sahaj tareeke se ramayana kii kahani suna rahi thi, lekin soshal media ke khurafatiyon ne edit karke ise kya se kya bana diya
 Actually, Divyangs were specially invited to attend this program of Modi's birth anniversary

 When the Indian cricket team sets off to play the fifth Test match against England on Friday, it will aim to not only win but avoid the series defeat, but also to save themselves from the tremendous defeat in the last two matches and save the lost honor
 Will also be its purpose
 england ne bhartiya cricket team ko manchester main hue chauthe match main maatr dhai dinon main pari or 54 ranon ke sharmnaak antar se haraaya tha
 With this victory, England also gained an unassailable 2–1 lead in the series
 lords main doosraa match haarane ke baad siries main pichhadane ke baad england ne na sirf siries main vaapasi kar lee, balki lambey samay se asafal chal rahe captain elistare cook ke liye bhi pichhali do jeet sanjivani sabit hua
 The way the Indian team in Manchester surrendered the match almost surreptitiously to England, it was not that it was the team that scored 800 runs in both innings, batting brilliantly in the first match at Trent Bridge and the second at Lord's
 Won the match
 pehle do maichon main shandaar pradarshan karne or siries main 1-0 kii badhat hasil kar lene ke baad bhartiya team kaa pradarshan or behatar hone kii bajaay girtaa hi gaya
 With the fourth match having ended two days earlier, the Indian team got extra time to prepare for the last decisive match, but captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni spent the Wednesday at the shooting range instead of practicing before the crucial match
 tisare match kii ahmiyat ko dekhte hue lords main jeet dilaane vaale tej gendbaaj eshanth sharma kii vaapasi par sarvaadhik charchaa ho rahi he
 Ishant could not play in the third and fourth matches due to an ankle injury
 eshanth swasth hokar abhyaas shivi main vaapasi to kar chuke hai, lekin ahm sawaal yah he ki kya vah itane feet hai ki match ke paanchon din kaa dabaav sahan kar saken
 In the event of Ishant's return, Pankaj Singh is set to leave, while Varun Aaron will be retained in the team to accompany him
 eshanth ke alaava bhartiya team main koi or badlaav hone kii sambhaavna to najar nahin aa rahi, lekin yadi madhyam gati se gendbaaji karne vaale harfanmaulaa khilaadi stuart binni ko ravindra jadeja kii jagah bulaayaa jaae to team ko gendbaaji or ballebaaji main thodi or gaharaai mil sakati he
 England, on the other hand, have a golden opportunity to beat India in the series, which they will try to capitalize on at all costs
 haalanki unke liye bhi yah utana aasaan nahin rahegaa, kyonki salaami ballebaaj sam robasan to unki chintaa bane hi hue hai, da ovel kii tej gendbaaji vaali pich par short pich gendon ke khilaaf unki naakaami bhi badi chintaa rahegi

 kai upanyaas va tamaam kahaniyaan pratham swatantraaa sangram ke ird-gird buni gai hai
 Senior writer Suryapal Singh's novel Aanch works to carry forward this link
 srijan kii ek parampara main hote hue bhi aanch ke sarokaar nae hai
 The continuation of the British rule in Awadh, the ouster of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, capturing Bahadurshah Zafar in Delhi, Rangoon Bhijwana are premeditated stories of the novel
 upanyaas main donon charitron ko aise pesh ki yaa gaya he ki unki haalat karunaa upjaati he
 Maintaining established evidence is included in the terms of historical novel writing
 pehle se gyaat ghatnakram srujanaatmak kalpana ke avasar ksheen kar dete hai
 In such a situation, it is very difficult to make a creative association of literature and history
 suryapal ne iske liye puri koshish kii he
 Without tampering with the facts
 upanyaas main badri, hamja, imaan or maulavee fakhruddin jaise paatr suryapal kii hi sristi hai
 But the most important aspect of the novel is the life of Begum Hazrat Mahal
 nawab waajid ali shah ke antahpur kii is agyatkul aurat ke saath upanyaaskaar ne bharsak nyaay kiya he
 Amaman, the mistress of a brothel of tawaifs, found a girl from somewhere
 unhone use naam diya aaysha
 Taught the dance and dance according to the ritual of Kothe
 uski aawaaj or ghunghru kii lay nawab ke kaanon tak pahunchi
 The royal palace was called
 waajid ali uski kaladakshata or khubsuurati par riz gaye or naam diya mahakapari
 The Nawab also married her
 phir naam badla iftikharunnisa begum
 Ayesha, who was left out of the room, was imprisoned in the school
 usne beghamon kii ‘ghaghara palaton’ banaai
 Iftikharunnisa took a vow to mallika-e-alia that the Nawab would not marry again
 nawab kaa man phir ek bandi par aayaa
 He did not get permission from Malika
 khayr, iftikharunnisa ne nawab ke bete ko janm diya, jiskaa naam padaa birjees kadra
 After becoming a mother, Iftikharunnisa got a new name - Hazrat Mahal
 pehle hi mahal se nikaali ja chukin hazrat mahal ne parikhane main vaapasi se inkaar kar diya
 War broke out between rebels and English forces in Lucknow
 panchayat baithi or hazrat mahal kii himmat ne unke bete birjees kadra ko gaddinshin kiya
 Hazrat Mahal, the guardian of the minor Birgis, was made
 unhone shashan apane haath main liya
 Gathering all the kings and rebels of Awadh, the English army was fiercely contested
 is upanyaas main suchanaaen or vivaran khub hai
 Sometimes it seems that this is not a story
 lekin upanyaaskaar katha-anviti ko phir-phir jod detaa he
 The intense activism of Hazrat Mahal from Azamgarh to Kanpur is the essence of fire
 avam ke bich se rajmahal tak pahunchi is stri kaa rekhankan bhartiya itihaas main ugantar kii soochna he
 This story of Hazrat Mahal is introduced like a recitation of a character named Anu in the first chapter 'atha Jyasahasa'
 naanaa kii beti, mahila sena kii pramukh naina, swatantraaa senaniyon kii madad karne vaali ajijan bai, uuda devi, jhalkaari bai, lakshmi bai aadi charitron ko jod den to yah upanyaas 1857 ko stri-drushti se, stri-charitron ke madhyam se rachataa he

 Rathore's mother was also pressurizing the girl for marriage
 vahiin , yuvati lagaataar is shaadi se inkaar kar rahi thi
 The investigation of this case is going on

 Researchers say that those who need a partner and who find themselves insecure in a relationship mostly commit infidelity with their partner
 kehane kaa matlab ye he ki agar ek partner ko duusare kii jarurat he or wo kisi vajah se us vakt uske saath nahin he to jaruratmand partner asurakshit mahasoos karne lagata he or wo kahin or jaakar sahaara dhundne lagata / lagati he
 The research team interacted with 207 newly-married couples six times in four years
 un logon se poocha gaya ki ve apane relationships main kitna surakshit yaa asurakshit mahasoos karte hai or ve apni shaadishuda jindagi se kitna santusht hai
 It was revealed in the study that only those who had feelings of insecurity towards the partner were cheating their partner
 shodhakartaaon ke mutabik research se saamne aae tathy 'lagaav siddhant' par aadhaarit hai
 People who have a safe environment around in childhood, they trust their partner more
 vahiin, jo bachapan se hi thode chintit swabhaav ke hote hai, unamem asuraksha kii bhaavana zyada hoti he or wo apane partner ko dhokhaa dete hai

 aaie jaanate hai wo teen kaaran jis vajah se aapako apane krash ko haal-e-dil jarur bataanaa chahie
 1 - If you love someone, then he must be told
 bhale hi wo aapkaa prapojal naa sweekaare lekin zaahiran use ye baat acchhee lagegi
 And then what if you don't know today, then tomorrow the situation should be such that both of you become one

 If you prove lucky, at least you will join the friend list

 The police are also surprised that the thief's heart did not come on these precious jewels, but on the watches of Rolex
 or agar chor ghadiyon kaa shaukeen hota bhi, to vah sabase mahangi, yani 60 lakh rupee kii ek, ghadi ko churaataa, 90 ghadiyon ko nahin, jinaki kul keemat nau karod rupee he
 If we also assume that the thief is not fond of watches, he is a vicious thief, then why did he steal the watches sold in the Chor markets like Delhi and Mumbai with great difficulty, while in the same showroom there are many heavy sculptures of gold and silver too They were both easy to sell and burn
 yahi nahin, chor ko yah bhi pataa tha ki showrooms ke andar or baahar sisitivi camere nahin lage hai, phir bhi vah showrooms maalik ke prati itnaa rahamdil rahaa ki usne sirf rolex kii un ghadiyon ko churaayaa, jinka beemaa ho rakhaa tha
 In fact, at first the police felt that since the locks on the shutters of the showroom were not broken on either side, a minor thief might have entered the inside by snapping the shutter with an iron rod, and cleaned hands on the clocks, But during the preliminary investigation, fingerprints of a minor have also not been found
 vaise, showrooms main 20 se zyaada log kaam karte hai, so, police un sabase poochtacha kar rahi he
 The night guard says he slept at night, and he is not aware of the theft
 showrooms ke manager ties chatarji kaa kahana he ki unhen kisi par shaq nahin he, lekin unka andaaza he ki chor shater ko tirachha karke andar daakhil hua hoga
 In response to why there were no CCTV cameras in this showroom selling expensive goods, he says that this showroom has been in Connaught Place since the year 1898, and CCTV cameras were supposed to be installed within a few days, but it was already stolen

 The Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court on Monday reserved its verdict in the case after hearing the arguments of the counsel of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), who had filed the relevant petition

 Sources said that the FIA wants to declare Kasab and Ansari as fugitive criminals so that Kasab's confessional statement can be used against 7 Pakistani suspects facing judicial action in planning and carrying out the Mumbai attacks
 in 7 sandigdhon main lashkar-e-taiyaba kaa commander jackieur rahamaan lakhvi, jaraar shah, hamaad amin sadik, abu al kama, shahid jameel riyaj, unus anjum or jameel ahamed shaamil hai
 Another bench of the Lahore High Court had earlier ruled that Kasab's statement could not be used as evidence in a Pakistani court
 aatankwaad-rodhi adaalat ne gat 27 march ko jari aadesh main kasaab or ansaari ko bhagoda apradhi ghoshit karne kii exe kii guzarish ko nakaar diya tha

 Political analysts and party leaders believe that the party has failed to elect a charismatic commander, causing the bjp's mission to flop before 2014 begins

 An official associated with the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha said, 'the party needed a charismatic and aggressive commander but the party has already scrapped its campaign for the Lok Sabha elections by not doing so
 ' vah kehete hai, 'soobe kii kaman varuna gandhi yaa uma bharti jaise logon ko saunpi jaani chahie thi, taaki party ko ek nai soch ke saath khadaa kiya ja sake
 Why the party is reluctant to give responsibility to Varun Gandhi is not understood
 'bhaajapa kaa pradesh adhyaksh banane ke baad lakshmikant vaajapeyi ne sadhi hui pratikriya dete hue kaha tha, "party main aise bahut se kaaryakarta hai jo mujhase zyada kshamtawan hai

 Speaking on the case of social activist Swami Agnivesh being beaten up by Hinduist organizations in Pakur, Jharkhand on Tuesday, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has said that the BJP goons used to beat Muslims, Dalits and tribals earlier and now they are doing so

 agnivesh par hamalaa karne vaale logon kaa yah bhi aarope tha ki vah aise logon kaa samarthan karte hai jo bif khate hai tathaa vah pakistan ke ishaare par kaam karte hai
 The BJP goons thrashing Muslims, Dalits and tribals now started beating the saints like Swami Agnivesh, the 78-year-old Arya Samaji saint

 He hates strong ideological opponents

 ruthik yahaan mangalvaar ko ek vishesh samaaroh main sabhi ko puja se parichit karaayenge
 The comments ruthik ne apane ek bayaan main kaha ki puja ko 'mohan jodado' ke saath sabhi se parichit karaane main kaaphi khushi hogi
 She is a very sweet and hardworking girl
 main aashwast hum ki unhen kaaphi pyaar or sammaan milane vaala he
 The Ashutosh Gowariker-directed film 'mohan Jodaro' will be released on 12 August
 aaie, ab dekhie puja hegade kii kuch tasviren- Hrithik said in one of his statements that Pooja will be very happy to make everyone familiar with 'mohan Jodaro'
 vah kaaphi pyaari or mehnatee ladki hai
 i am sure that he is going to get a lot of love and respect
 ashutosh goarikar nirdeshit film 'mohan jodado' 12 agast ko relies hogi
 Come, now see some pictures of Pooja Hegde- aaie, ab dekhie puja hegade kii kuch tasviren- An official meeting between Indian and Chinese soldiers took place near Bumla in Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh
 isamen donon desh vaastavik niyantran rekha par shanti banaae rakhane or sambandh sudhaarney par sahamat hue
 The meeting took place on China's National Day

 The Chinese delegation was led by Colonel Taing Fu Cheng
 baithak mendonon deshonke rashtriya dhvaj fahraae gaye or donon pratinidhimandal ke netaaon ne aadhikarik rup se apni baat rakhi

 The distance from Maninagar to Raisina Hills is about 1,000 km but to reach here, Narendra Modi had to travel for eight months, 430 rallies and three lakh km of exhausting journey
 desh kaa koi konaa aisa nahin bachaa jahaan narendra modi kii awaz na gunji ho
 The commitment and loyalty with which he connected himself with the people of the country and made them his own is rarely seen in the history of independent India
 yah samvaad sabhi swaroopon main tha, vah bade-bade manchon se ho rahaa tha, tivi channelon se ho rahaa tha or soshal media ke jariye ho rahaa tha
 It is surprising that a tea-selling boy becomes such a big player on social media to leave everyone behind
 twitor jaise samvaad ke madhyam to kuch samay pehle tak ilit class tak hi simit the
 But Narendra Modi had foreseen that this form of social media would take him closer to the youth, closer to the youth who have golden dreams of the future and who want to be a part of the new world
 narendra modi un karodon naujavaanon ke kareeb pahunche or unase samvaad sthapit karne main safal hue
 It may be of interest here to know how Rahul Gandhi forgot the effective weapon of social media while living and studying abroad
 soshal media ne logon ko jodne kaa jo vishaal manch diya he uskaa itnaa badhiya istemaal aaj tak nahin hua tha
 This visit of Narendra Modi will inspire crores of Indians to do something big for years because it was an unprecedented effort to make them their own by communicating with strangers
 soshal media kaa sateek istemaal, har kisi tak apni baaten pahunchaana or in sabase badhkar har baar ek nai baat kahana, in sabhi ne unhen bulandiyon par pahunchaa diya jaae
 As soon as he came to Delhi, he changed his way of communication and now it has become very pithy
 vah bolne kii bajaay apni bhav-bhangimaaon se hi samvaad sthapit kar rahe hai jo pradhanmantri jaise bade pad par baithne vaale ko shobhaa detii he
 Their conversation has become more polite than before and they are overcome by aggression
 chup rahanaa ek kala he jisamen narsingh raav ko maharath hasil thi lekin manmohan singh to itane chup rahe ki usne desh main samvadaheenata kii sthiti paidaa kar di
 Now we can expect from Narendra Modi that the series of dialogues that he has created will continue to be so

 If anti-incumbency is a fact then Rajasthan is a living example of this
 saal 1993 se kisi bhi party kii sarkaar lagaataar duusari baar nahin bani
 Surveys before the elections are also indicating that there can be a change of power in Rajasthan this time too
 saidhantik rup se aisa mana jaataa he ki netritv kii adla-badali arthvyavastha or vikaas main rukaawat paidaa karti he
 But if you look at the figures of Rajasthan, this theory will fail
 rajya main lagaataar bijepi-congress ke bich satta parivartan ke baavjood rajasthan vikaas ke vibhinn maapdandon par acha pradarshan kar rahaa he
 The latest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data shows that the state had an annual growth rate of 5% between 2013-18 under Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's government
 vahiin desh kii GDP main rajasthan kaa yogadan pichley 5 varshon main 5 fisadi rahaa jabaki rajya kii jansankhya desh kii kul aabaadi kaa 5
 7 percent
 jab 7 fisadi tak pahunchi GDP kii vruddhi darhaal ke varshon main rajasthan kii mahatvapurn vruddhi purv kii ashok gahalot kii aguwai vaali congress sarkaar main hui, jab 2008-13 ke bich GDP kii vruddhi dar 7 fisadi tak pahunchi or desh kii GDP main rajasthan kaa yogadan 4
 From 4% to 5%
 yah vruddhi utpaadan ke maamle main pradarshan se prerit thi, kyonki is dauraan bharat ke audyogic utpaadan main rajasthan kaa hissaa 4
 8 per cent to 5
 6 fisadi pahunch gaya
 Whereas Rajasthan contributed 5% to the industrial production of the country in the last five years
 yah pradarshan vasundhara sarkaar ke adhik nivesh ko aakarshith karne ke safal prayaason ke baavjood rahaa
 25 per cent more investment, according to data from the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an organization that monitors economic affairs data, Rajasthan attracted an investment of Rs 90750 crore in the Vasundhara government, 25 per cent more than the former Gehlot government
 
 mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne sarkaar main aane se pehle 15 lakh nae rojgaar kaa vaada kiya tha
 For this, he also made efforts to promote employment
 aisa karne ke liye unhone shram sudhaar kii disha main kai kadam uthaae taaki companiyon ko karmchaariyon kii bhartee karne main aasaani ho
 But these reforms did not show the expected results
 pichley ek dashak main desh kii factriyon main rojgaar bade hai, lekin rajasthan kii bhagidaari desh ke audyogic karmchaariyon kii kul sankhya main 3
 It is only 5 percent
 jo bhi rojgaar paidaa hue ve sanvida karmiyon ke hue
 According to 2015-16 figures, the number of contract workers in Rajasthan industries was 39
 6 fisadi he
 Farmers' income has also increased
 This data shows why the lack of employment is the biggest issue in the csds-lokniti pre-poll survey
 rajasthan kii duusari badi chintaa krishi sankat he
 Let me tell you that 60 percent of the workers of Rajasthan are dependent on farming and in recent times they even took to the road with their demands, while some gave up their lives
 ek research ke mutabik rajasthan ke kisaanon kaa ausat bhartiya kisaanon kii tulana main pradarshan acha rahaa
 According to this study, the income of farmers of Rajasthan increased by 63 percent between 2003-13, while the average increase in income of farmers of the country during this period was 34 percent
 haalanki rajasthan ke kisaanon ko haal ke maheenon main tagada jhatka laga he
 Due to bumper yields of garlic, gram and moong, prices fell and they suffered losses
 kota sambhag main lahasun kaa daam is baar bada chunavi mudda he
 Poverty figures declined as procurement was also weak due to falling prices
 rajya main genhu kii kul kharid desh hui kul kharid se 5 fisadi kam hui jabaki rajasthan desh kaa 9 fisadi genhu paidaa karata he
 Oxford University, the number of people living in poverty in Rajasthan is 32%
 haalanki garibi ke aankadon main 2005-06 kii tulana main 30 fisadi kii kami ai he, lekin yah desh ke ausat 28 fisadi se zyada he
 However, Rajasthan performed well on some parameters of development
 shishu mrityu dar main sudhaar hua he or yah desh kii shishu mrityu dar 41:1000 ke baraabar, jo ki 2005-06 main 65:1000 tha
 As on date, 90 percent of the households in Rajasthan have an electricity connection while the figure is 88 percent in the country
 aankadon main yah sudhaar vibhinn dalon ke shasankaal main dhire-dhire hota rahaa, lekin jin votaron ke or bhi kai mudde hai unhen yah aankade prabhavit kar paaen isaki ummid kam he
 Beyond jobs and agrarian crises, ethnic conflicts have played a major role in the recent politics of Rajasthan and are believed to have an impact on voting

 aam taur par aisa aarope kisi aatanki ke upar hi lagaaya jaataa he lekin mumbai police kii najar main yah kaam kiya he cartoonist aseem trivedi ne
 The police FIR says that the cartoon created by Aseem could have created a sense of rebellion against the government in the country
 ravivaar ko aseem kii hiraasat ke liye adaalat main peshi ke dauraan police ne kaaphi oonche daawey kiye
 Police told the court that apart from Aseem, they are looking for more people who helped Aseem to make cartoons and upload them on the Internet
 kanoonee jaankaar aseem kii hiraasat par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Former IPS YP Singh says, "if the magistrate's order has also come to the police, then the police would continue to register the case and investigate, but the arrest of the Supreme Court has been disregarded
" " According to Singh, "the Supreme Court has clearly said that the arrest should be made when the direction of investigation is not found and the accused does not cooperate in the investigation, but in the case of Aseem, both of them do not fit
" " Knowing the legalities, they say that Aseem has been arrested, but even if the police wants, the matter cannot be brought for hearing in the court
 police ko adaalat main bataanaa hoga ki kya aseem ke cartoon se desh main vidroh kii bhaavana bani he
 
 
 Have Asim's cartoons been shown to people by making them under a conspiracy
 
 
 kya aseem ke cartoon ko dekhakar kisi ne sarkaar ke khilaaf baghawat kii he
 Experts are now also raising the question that when the police did not want the custody of Aseem, then why was Aseem's custody demanded during the appearance on Sunday
 kanoonee jaankaar ashish chavaan ne bataaya, "maine abtak ke mere kariyar main aisa maamla nahin dekha jab pehle police hiraasat maangati he or phir agle din hi use sarender kar detii he
 This shows the intention of the police how she is working on the case
 " Now that Aseem says that he will neither hire a lawyer nor bail for the hearing of the case, there are only a few options left for Aseem to come out of jail
 chavaan ke mutabik, "police chaahe to section 169 ke tahat yachika daayar kar aseem par se maamla kaarij karne kii maang kar sakati he or aseem kii jamaanat kaa virodh na kar use jamaanat dene main madad bhi kar sakati he lekin aise main bhi aseem ko adaalat ke kuch niyamon kaa paalan karne kaa vaayada karnaa hoga
 "comments duusari ore, aseem kii mushkilen kam nahin hui hai
 The government cannot end the case even if it wants to, because the complainant in the case has every right to raise his voice against the investigation of the police and demand to re-investigate the case as well as get the investigation done by another agency Can request lekin, aseem ke khilaaf sirf mumbai main hi nahin, maharashtra ke bid jile main bhi deshadroh kaa maamla darj he
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see whether the Beed Police also arrests Asim in a cartoon controversy after seeing the action taken by the Mumbai Police against Aseem
 police kii exiaar kahati he ki aseem ke banaae gaye cartoon ke chalate desh main sarkaar ke khilaaf vidroh kii bhaavana nirmaan ho sakati thi
 The police made very high claims during the court appearance for Asim's custody on Sunday
 police ne adaalat ko bataaya ki aseem ke alaava unhen or bhi logon kii talash he jinhone aseem ko cartoon banane or inhen internet par aplod karne main madad kii
 Legal experts are questioning Asim's custody
 purv ipies wipi singh kaa kahana he, "agar police ke paas magistrate kaa aadesh bhi aayaa he to police maamla darj kar jaanch karti rahati lekin giraftaar karnaa supreme court ke disha nirdesh kii avhelnaa kii gai he
 " singh ke anusaar, "supreme court ne saafe kaha he giraftaar us vaqt kii jaani chahie jab jaanch kii disha na mil paae or aaropee jaanch main sahyog na kare lekin aseem ke maamle main ye donon hi sahi nahin baithte hai
 " kanoonee jaanakar bataate hai ki aseem ko giraftaar to kar liya gaya he lekin agar police chaahe bhi to yah maamla adaalat main sunwaayee ke liye nahin laa sakati
 The police will have to tell in the court whether the cartoon of Aseem has created a sense of rebellion in the country
 
 
 kya aseem ke cartoon ko kisi sajeesh ke tahat banaakar logon ko dikhaaya gaya he
 
 
 Has anyone revolted against the government after seeing Asim's cartoon? jaankaar ab yah sawaal bhi uthaa rahe hai ki jab police ko aseem kii hiraasat nahin chahie thi to tab ravivaar ko peshi ke dauraan aseem kii hiraasat kii maang hi kyon kii gai
 Legal expert Ashish Chavan told, "I have not seen such a case in my career so far when the police first asks for custody and then surrenders it the very next day
 yah police kii manshaa bataati he kii vah cese ko lekar kis tarah kaam kar rahi he
 " ab jabaki aseem kaa kahana he ki vah maamle kii sunwaayee ke liye na to vakil kii seva legaa or na hi jamaanat to aise main aseem ke jail se bahaar aane ke sirf gine-chune vikalp hi bachate hai
 According to Chavan, "if the police wants, then by filing a petition under section 169, Aseem can demand the dismissal of the case and by not opposing Aseem's bail, he can also help in giving bail to Aseem
 We have to promise to follow certain rules
 "tippaniyan On the other hand, Aseem's troubles have not diminished
 agar sarkaar chaahe to bhi maamle ko khatm nahin kar sakati he, kyonki maamle ke shikayatakarta ke paas police kii jaanch ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane kaa puraa haq hota he or vah maamle kii phir se jaanch kii maang ke saath-saath jaanch kisi or agency se karaane kii darkhwaast kar sakati he
 However, sedition cases have been registered against Aseem not only in Mumbai but also in Maharashtra's Beed district
 ab aise main yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki mumbai police kii aseem ke khilaaf kii gai karrwai ko dekhakar kya bid police bhi aseem ko cartoon vivaad main giraftaar karti he

 purv ipies wipi singh kaa kahana he, "agar police ke paas magistrate kaa aadesh bhi aayaa he to police maamla darj kar jaanch karti rahati lekin giraftaar karnaa supreme court ke disha nirdesh kii avhelnaa kii gai he
 " singh ke anusaar, "supreme court ne saafe kaha he giraftaar us vaqt kii jaani chahie jab jaanch kii disha na mil paae or aaropee jaanch main sahyog na kare lekin aseem ke maamle main ye donon hi sahi nahin baithte hai
 " kanoonee jaanakar bataate hai ki aseem ko giraftaar to kar liya gaya he lekin agar police chaahe bhi to yah maamla adaalat main sunwaayee ke liye nahin laa sakati
 The police will have to tell in the court whether the cartoon of Aseem has created a sense of rebellion in the country
 
 
 kya aseem ke cartoon ko kisi sajeesh ke tahat banaakar logon ko dikhaaya gaya he
 
 
 Has anyone revolted against the government after seeing Asim's cartoon? jaankaar ab yah sawaal bhi uthaa rahe hai ki jab police ko aseem kii hiraasat nahin chahie thi to tab ravivaar ko peshi ke dauraan aseem kii hiraasat kii maang hi kyon kii gai
 Legal expert Ashish Chavan told, "I have not seen such a case in my career so far when the police first asks for custody and then surrenders it the very next day
 yah police kii manshaa bataati he kii vah cese ko lekar kis tarah kaam kar rahi he
 " ab jabaki aseem kaa kahana he ki vah maamle kii sunwaayee ke liye na to vakil kii seva legaa or na hi jamaanat to aise main aseem ke jail se bahaar aane ke sirf gine-chune vikalp hi bachate hai
 According to Chavan, "if the police wants, then by filing a petition under section 169, Aseem can demand the dismissal of the case and by not opposing Aseem's bail, he can also help in giving bail to Aseem
 We have to promise to follow certain rules
 "tippaniyan On the other hand, Aseem's troubles have not diminished
 agar sarkaar chaahe to bhi maamle ko khatm nahin kar sakati he, kyonki maamle ke shikayatakarta ke paas police kii jaanch ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane kaa puraa haq hota he or vah maamle kii phir se jaanch kii maang ke saath-saath jaanch kisi or agency se karaane kii darkhwaast kar sakati he
 However, sedition cases have been registered against Aseem not only in Mumbai but also in Maharashtra's Beed district
 ab aise main yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki mumbai police kii aseem ke khilaaf kii gai karrwai ko dekhakar kya bid police bhi aseem ko cartoon vivaad main giraftaar karti he
 According to Singh, "the Supreme Court has clearly said that the arrest should be made when the direction of investigation is not found and the accused does not cooperate in the investigation, but in the case of Aseem, both of them do not fit
" " Knowing the legalities, they say that Aseem has been arrested, but even if the police wants, the matter cannot be brought for hearing in the court
 police ko adaalat main bataanaa hoga ki kya aseem ke cartoon se desh main vidroh kii bhaavana bani he
 
 
 Have Asim's cartoons been shown to people by making them under a conspiracy
 
 
 kya aseem ke cartoon ko dekhakar kisi ne sarkaar ke khilaaf baghawat kii he
 Experts are now also raising the question that when the police did not want the custody of Aseem, then why was Aseem's custody demanded during the appearance on Sunday
 kanoonee jaankaar ashish chavaan ne bataaya, "maine abtak ke mere kariyar main aisa maamla nahin dekha jab pehle police hiraasat maangati he or phir agle din hi use sarender kar detii he
 This shows the intention of the police how she is working on the case
 " Now that Aseem says that he will neither hire a lawyer nor bail for the hearing of the case, there are only a few options left for Aseem to come out of jail
 chavaan ke mutabik, "police chaahe to section 169 ke tahat yachika daayar kar aseem par se maamla kaarij karne kii maang kar sakati he or aseem kii jamaanat kaa virodh na kar use jamaanat dene main madad bhi kar sakati he lekin aise main bhi aseem ko adaalat ke kuch niyamon kaa paalan karne kaa vaayada karnaa hoga
 "comments duusari ore, aseem kii mushkilen kam nahin hui hai
 The government cannot end the case even if it wants to, because the complainant in the case has every right to raise his voice against the investigation of the police and demand to re-investigate the case as well as get the investigation done by another agency Can request lekin, aseem ke khilaaf sirf mumbai main hi nahin, maharashtra ke bid jile main bhi deshadroh kaa maamla darj he
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see whether the Beed Police also arrests Asim in a cartoon controversy after seeing the action taken by the Mumbai Police against Aseem
 kanoonee jaanakar bataate hai ki aseem ko giraftaar to kar liya gaya he lekin agar police chaahe bhi to yah maamla adaalat main sunwaayee ke liye nahin laa sakati
