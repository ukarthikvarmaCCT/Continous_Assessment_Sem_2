 spain ke madrid main shuru hui 25veen conference of da parties (siopi / cop) kii kaarywahi main do mudde sabase zyaada chhaae rahenge—carbon credit or jalwaayu badlaav ke kaaran ho rahe nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye funding
 As such, more big issues are facing the COP
 mukhya rup se yah utsarjan main us gahari katautee ke bare main he jo vaigyanikon ke anusaar is dharti ko varming ke khatarnaak str tak pahunchane se rokane ke liye bahut jaruri he
 So many countries will have to set big targets by next year to achieve this
 carbon credit darasal carbon dioxide kii vah dharnatmak maatra he jo aap apni audyogic prakriyaaon main sudhaar laakar utsarjit hone se bachaate hai
 The same carbon dioxide is traded as a commodity, that is, you deposit a carbon credit in your account
 ab madrid main bahes kaa ek bada mudda yah he ki kioto protocol ke tahat companiyon or deshon ne jo carbon credit jamaa kiye hai, kya unhen 2020 ke baad bhi khaaton main banaae rakhaa ja saktaa he? bharat sarkaar ke paas 75 karod siiaar credit hai
 Her and the Brazilian government argue that previous carbon credits should also be accepted under the Sustainable Development Mechanism replacing the Clean Development System of the Kyoto Treaty
 ab is baat kaa virodh karne vaali in daleelon main bhi kuch dam to he ki pramanikaran kii gadabad prakriya ke kaaran kai companiyon ne farji tareeke se credit hasil kar liye hai
 But the point is that to reject this credit outright would also undermine the market process that some see as a way to move forward
 haalanki samasya isse gahari he
 The main stated target ie emission reduction is far-fetched
 2008 ke vittiya sankat ke baad or kuch pramukh deshon ke kioto sandhi ke duusare charan se haath khinch lene ke kaaran siiaar kaa mulya dhadaam se gira
 At present, carbon emissions are 60 per cent higher than the level of coop process started 25 years ago
 carbon credit aam taur par companiyon ko phayda pahunchaate hai, jabaki haani ke liye funding se mote taur par prabhavit samudaayon ko madad mil sakati he
 The 2013 Warsaw International Mechanism for Losses was incorporated into Article 8 of the Paris Agreement to include not only the damage caused by any climate impact but also to contain early warning systems and emergency preparedness
 
 bharat or duusare deshon kii yah maang jaij hi he ki aisi karrwai or madad ke liye viksit desh kharch uthaaen
 The implicit understanding behind this is that developed countries / blocks are more responsible for historical emissions since 1750
 is disha main koi khaas laabh nahin hua he
 There is no indication that there will be any significant progress in Madrid on this issue
 na hi vaastavik vittiya madad ke mudde par nikat bhavishya main khaas pragati kii sambhaavna he kyonki is mudde par jor daalane kii hamaari kshamta nahin he
 At the moment, there is a similar situation of economic decline in the whole world
 is gatirodh se baahar nikalne kaa ek rasta pichley hakrate ek saarvajanik baithak main enjio ection aid ne sujhaayaa tha—ki saarvajanik vitt ugaahna or is mad main aavantit kiya janaa chahie or ise sakasham banane ke liye vyapak vittiya suvidha honi chahie
 The Government of India, while expanding the Madrid agenda, advocated that developed countries fulfill pre-2020 commitments such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions
 haalanki, isamen bhi, bharat sarkaar mul dikkat ko samajhane main naakaam rahi he
 The US was absent in the Kyoto treaty, China and India did not come under its purview, and Russia, Japan dropped out of its second phase — so only a small portion of the world's emissions come in the pre-2020 period
 zyada gambhir mudda yah he ki paris samjhaute ke tahat saare desh apni patibaddhtaon ko puraa kar den to bhi ausatan 3 degree ke hisaab se dharti kaa taapmaana badhegaa jo prithvi par pichley chalis lakh saal main nahin hua he
 All parties have to make commitments by next year
 bharat kii pramukh patibaddhta he 2030 tak jidipi ke saapeksh utsarjan kii tivrata main 33-35 fisadi katautee laana
 It is less
 agar hamaari taraf se apni patibaddhta main bina shart ijapha hoga to hamen chote dweep deshon or anya vikasshil deshon kaa samarthan mil sakegaa or ham viksit deshon par teevr katautiyon kii vachanabaddhata kaa naitik dabaav daal sakenge
 Madrid is an important stop in this very serious race

 com / kqlurjwl7c Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a prolific sportswoman, has once again proved that she favors better relations with neighboring countries, but India's sovereignty cannot be compromised under any circumstances
 shanghai sahyog sanghathan (SCO) shikhar sammelan main shirkat karne pahunche piem modi ne china kii tamaam koshishon ke baavjood use tagada jhatka diya he
 China has been trying to get India on its ambitious project 'one Belt One Road' (OBOR) for a long time, but it has to face failure repeatedly
 is baar bhi aisa hua or SCO shikhar sammelan main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne china kii van belt van road pariyojna kaa samarthan karne se inkaar kar diya
 It also advised China to respect transparency and sovereignty
 scosaxasya deshon main bharat iklauta desh he, jo china kii is pariyojna kaa samarthan nahin kar rahaa he
 Actually, this project of China passes through Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok), which India has been strongly opposed to
 bharat isko apni samprabhutaa kaa ulanghan maanata he
 India says pok is an integral part from where China cannot do such a construction without its permission
 SCO shikhar sammelan main rus, pakistan, kazakhstan, kirgistan, uzbekistan or tajikistan ne china kii van belt van road pariyojna ke samarthan ko doharaaya, lekin bharat ne is par kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 It was clear that India still does not support this project of China
 philhal ise china kii koshishon ke liye ek jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 At the SCO summit on Sunday, PM Modi certainly put India's perspective on connectivity projects, but he did not support China's OBOR project
 unhone connactivity projecton par paardarshita or samprabhutaa kaa sammaan karne kii baat kahi
 Addressing the SCO summit for the first time, PM Modi said that today we are again at a place where physical and digital connectivity are changing the definition of geography
 visheshkar SCO kshetra or padosi deshon ke saath connactivity bharat kii praathamikta he
 We welcome new connectivity projects that are inclusive, transparent and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries
 chhattisgarh kaa puraa bastar divijan kaa odief matlab khule main shouch se mukt hona rajya ke liye gaurav kii baat he
 But within a few days, schemes related to construction of toilets went to waste in most areas
 iskaa mukhya kaaran shauchalay ke istemaal ke liye pani kaa naa hona he
 In a large part of Bastar, neither the tap water schemes have been expanded nor the hand pumps have been installed according to the population
 iske chalate pani ke liye jyadatar logon ko subah se lekar raat tak do chaar hona padataa he
 Their priorities are fixed, first for drinking water, then for cooking and cleaning utensils, after this, water requirements for washing clothes and then defecation are fixed
 shauchalay ke liye paniunki antim aavashyaktaa he
 This is clearly visible in rural areas
 ek badi aabaadi gharon main shauchalay hone ke baavjood khule main shouch kii raah pakadati he
 The condition of water in urban areas is as strong as the condition of rural areas
 log jangal, pahari ilaakon, jharanon, talabon or kuon se pani laa kar guzaara karte hai
 In such a situation, the appropriateness of the ODF scheme has been questioned
 shauchalay he, pani nahinchhattisgarh ke bastar main aadha darjan jile ODF ghoshit kar die gaye hai
 The government claims that toilets have been built in 100 percent of the houses in all tribal areas
 lekin shauchalay ban jane ke baavjood kai log gharon se baahar shouch ke liye ja rahe hai
 He tried to go to the toilet in his house several times to defecate but remained upset all day because there was no water in the house
 iske chalate khule main shouch main jane ke baad hi unhen raahat mil saki
 In fact, most areas of Bastar are declared ODF on paper only
 hakeekat main inhen ODF kii sthiti main aane main lambaa arsa lag saktaa he kyonki jab tak gaanv main water supplai line nahin aegi, paryaapt hand pump nahin lagenge, tab tak log khule main shouch jate rahenge
 People can be seen with a box of water in hand as they go out of Jagdalpur
 unase poochne par unki daleel bhi gauratlab hoti he
 The villagers clearly say that from where to get water for the toilet, drinking water is very difficult
 bastar ke vidhayak or bastar vikaas praadhikaran ke sadsy santosh bafnas ke mutabik sarkaar har sambhav prayaas kar rahi he ki logon ko paryaapt pani muhaiyaa ho sake
 According to him, the thinking of the villagers is changing rapidly and they have started using the toilet
 haalanki abhi bhi bahut kuch kiya janaa baaki he
 Districts got certificates After the declaration of Dantewada, Sukma, Kondagaon and Bijapur of Bastar division in Chhattisgarh as ODF districts, the administration not only breathed a sigh of relief but also patted their backs on this
 in tamamjilon ko ODF pramaan patramila or rajya ke mukhyamantri raman singh ne chaaron jilon ke colectoron ko shaabaashi bhi di thi
 The administration is busy in the matter of how to improve the habits of the villagers, they are being trained to defecate at home
 lekin pani kaa bandobast karne ke maamle main afasar chuppi saadh lete hai
 He argues that the villagers should bring water right away and save it in their home
 ab ODF kii hakeekat bataane par afasar jaanch kii baat kah rahe hai
 The government put in full force to declare the Bastar Division as ODF
 colectoron ko target fiks kar jald se jald unke ilaakon ko ODF ghoshit karne ke liye dabaav daalaa gaya
 Collectors also left no stone unturned in following government orders
 unhone naa to nal-jal yojanaon ke vistaar kii ore dhyaan diya or naa hi ek badi gramin aabaadi ko sahajata se pani muhaiyaa ho, iskaa koi prabandh nahin kiya
 As a result, more than half of the hundred and not two hundred people are still defecating in the open
 iske chalate shauchalay nirmaan kii kavayad dhari kii dhari rah gayi
 Not only this, the justification for declaring ODF in these areas has also been questioned
 kutton ko yun hi darvesh nahin kaha jaataa
 An incident in Mumbai is an example of this
 yahaan lucky naam ke kute ne jaan dekar apni malkin kii jindagi bachaa lee
 On Sunday afternoon, a man named Venkatesh in the Sion Kolliwada area of mumbai became so mad after an altercation with his girl friend that he ran after her with a big knife to attack
 ladki jaan bachaane ke liye ek ghar kaa darwaja khulaa dekhakar usamen ghus gai
 In retrospect 23-year-old Venkatesh also reached there
 ghar kii malkin sumati ne venkatesh ko rokane kii koshish kii to usne usee par hamalaa kar diya
 Seeing this, Sumati's one year old dog pounced on Lucky Venkatesh
 lucky ne pehle bhunk kar venkatesh ko bhagane kii koshish kii
 If he did not agree, then Lucky cut him twice
 venkatesh ke sir par to phir khun savaar ho gaya
 He stabbed Lucky in his stomach
 lucky kii maukey par hi maut ho gai
 After this Venkatesh fled from there
 sumati ne 'aaj tak' ko bataaya, "maine venkatesh ko rokane kii koshish kii
 He had a big stab
 usne mere par hamalaa karne kii koshish kii
 Pushed me and grabbed by the hair
 ye dekh lucky mujhe bachaane aayaa
 "sumati filed a case with the police under Section 429 of the IPC
 aarope sabit hone par venkatesh ko paanch saal tak sajaa yaa jurmaana ho saktaa he
 Police arrested venkatesh
stab was also recovered from uske paas se chura bhi baraamad kiya gaya
 However Venkatesh was released the same day on a bond of Rs 5000
 sumati kaa kahana he ki lucky hi uske liye jeene kaa bada sahaara tha
 According to Sumati, her parents had died a long time ago
 wo is ghar main apane bhai ke saath rahati he
 a year ago, some street children left the door at her doorstep
 tab se hi usne kute ko ghar main rakh liya or lucky naam diya
 According to Sumati, Lucky was so moved with her that if she went anywhere, she would stay back and forth
 sumati nepulicepar venkatesh ke saath dhilaai baratane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Sumati says that she should be lucky for everything
 chhattisgarh ke ambikapur or durg jile ke baad ab mahasamund main bhi nakli noton ke bade kaarobaar kaa gorakhdhandha saamne aayaa he

 These people used to print new notes ranging from hundred rupees to two thousand rupees
 pichley ek dedh saalon main rang birangi nai karency bazaar main ai he
 Therefore, the accused did not take any pleasure in printing the new currency
 nae noton se abhi bhi log bhaleebhanti parichit nahin he, isi kaa phayda aropiyon ne uthaaya or nakli karency ko khapaane ke liye petrol pump, bheed bhaad vaale ilaakon kii dukaane or mukhya bazaaron kaa sahaara liya

 patna main aparaadhiyon kii himmat itani bad gai he ki aaj purv IPS adhikari ajay verma ke parivaar ko unhone nishaanaa banaaya
 The police senses flew as soon as live shots of the fight with the IPS officer surfaced
 IPS ajay verma kii patni ne kaha ki hamaari baat jab patna police ne nahin suni to aam janata ke saath kya karti hogi?patna main bikers gang ne kis kadar utpaat machaa rakhaa he, ye kisi se chhipi nahin he
 The police do not take any strict action against them, due to which their courage is increasing daily
 aaj bikers gang kaa shikaar purv IPS adhikari ajay verma or unke parivaar ko hona padaa
 The whole family was beaten up, their car glass shattered
 puri ghatana kii live footage jab soshal media par viral hue to police ke aalaa adhikari sakriy hue
 At the time of the incident, IPS wife Sampa Sinha dialed 100 numbers, but did not get any help
 ghatana kii soochna ucch adhikariyon ko di gai, lekin is dauraan koi police ghatnasthal par nahin pahunchi
 The criminal youth left himself after being vandalized
 iske baad IPS kaa puraa parivaar kisi prakaar se apane ghar nageshwar colony pahunchaa
 Thankfully no one got hurt
 is dauraan badmaashon ne gaadi ke saath todphod kii
 The police tried to suppress the incident that happened during the day, but the video of the incident went viral on social media
 iske baad police harakat main ai
 In a hurry, a case was registered against unknown people
 maamla bhi abhi duusare thane main he, jabaki ramkrishna nagar thane main maamla abhi tak transfar nahin kiya gaya he
 IPS Ajay Verma and his wife Sampa Sinha told that today there is no such thing as good governance left in Bihar
 police kaa khauf ab khatm ho gaya he
 Even after giving information, police did not reach the spot on time
 isse aparaadhiyon kaa manobal bad gaya
 After seeing the attitude of the police with the people, we can say how the attitude of the police with the common people would be
 hamane ghatana ke saare video police ko saunp die hai
 About the incident, Sampa Sinha said that we had gone to a marble shop
 bypass enech-30 par sadak par jam laga hua tha
 During this time, the youth who came from the bike hit our car
 hamane jab iskaa virodh kiya to unhone hamaare saath marpet shuru kar di
 Meanwhile, 40 to 50 people came with him
 purv IPS adhikari ajay verma ne bataaya ki jab DGP pulicekarmiyon se der se jane kaa kaaran puuchhenge to wo kahenge ki isse jaruri kaam aa gaya tha
 When the police were not taking any action on our phone, then how would the general public be treated
 bhartiya fouj ke jaanbaaj commando ne abhi to bas zaraa sa trailor hi dikhaaya tha ki pakistan main baithe bharat ke dushmano ke paseene chhot gaye
 The fear of his death started to frighten him so that after a few hours after the attack, all of them have gone out of their homes and hidden in the bills
 sirf is dar se ki kahin ki ab bhartiya fouj unke gharon main ghus kar unhen naa maar den
 According to reports coming from Pakistan, India's three biggest enemies are Lashkar Chief Hafiz Saeed, Jaish chief Masood Azhar and 93 Mumbai serial blasts convict Dawood Ibrahim are hiding at intelligence bases
 pioke main bhartiya commando ke sargical strike ke baad pakistani media main guuruuvaar din bhar hafiz said oramasood ajahar kii surakshako lekar kai channelon par charchaa tak hui
 Since Pakistan has been denying Dawood's presence in Pakistan since the beginning, there was no talk about Dawood
 ye baat samajhi ja sakati he
 But now as soon as Indian commandos entered into pok and killed Saeed and Masood Azhar & Co
 militants, both Saeed and Masood Azhar remembered Osama
 osama ko america ke sil commando ne aise hi ek oparation main abtabad main uske ghar main ghus kar maaraa tha
 Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar changed their bases on Wednesday after receiving news of the surgical strike
 sutron ke mutabik ab donon apane-apane madrason or sanghathan ke headquarter se dur kuch chuninda gurgon ke saath ghani aabaadi ke bich rahane chale gaye hai
 Their thinking behind this is that it is more secure to live among the densely populated
 kyonki aisi jagahon par koi bada oparation karne kaa jokhim nahin letaa
 After entering the pok, the Indian army killed the terrorists hiding in the Terror Camp, and the Terror Camp was destroyed
 khabar he ki elosi ke kareeb adhikrut kashmir main chal rahe kam se kam 16 se 17 teror camp affin jagah se dur bastiyon ke bich shift kar die gaye hai
 Not only this, Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar are also hiding among people in dense settlements to save their lives
 jabaki daaud ibrahim ko paak army ke afasaron ke rihaishi ilaake main shift kar diya gaya he
 The soldiers of Bihar and Dogra Regiment have taken revenge by the way of surgical strike of Indian Army, who have gone to enemy of India sitting in Pakistan
 darasal uri hamale kii tis vaise to har hindustani ke dil main thi
 But he was a soldier of Bihar and Dogra Regiment who felt the most of this pain
 kyonki us hamale main inhen regiment ke jawan aatankiyon kaa nishaanaa bane the
 In such a situation, when the Hindustani army carried out the surgical strike in pok, only the soldiers of these two regiments took the revenge of their comrades by choosing
 ghaatak naam ke commandos utane hi jeedaar hai bas yun samaj lijie ki hindustan fouj ke ye commandos jis taraf chal padate hai, dushmano ke chakke chhot jate hai
 When the other units of the Hindustan army joined these deadly commandos in the pok's surgical strike, there was a furore that the enemy was engulfed
 parde par filmi star kii body yuvaaon ko khub lubhaati he
 And every youth going to the gym wants to be like them
 gym main ghanton pasinaa bahaanaa or diet supplement lenaa nai jenereshan kaa shagal he
 Normally a healthy man does not need any food supplements
 par body building karne vaale logon ko protein, sodium, kaborhydrate or potacium kii zyada aavashyaktaa hoti he
 This can also be accomplished by making changes in catering
 agar khanpan main badlaav nahin kar sakate to in tatwon kii kami ko puraa karne ke liye doctor kii salaah se achche food supplement liye ja sakate hai
 Types of supplements: Protein powder: fulfills the protein requirement of the body
 critin:mansapeshiyon kaa ghanatv badhaata he
 Glutamine: Completes the lack of chemicals in the body during exercise and prevents the size of the muscles from decreasing
 kaabre:kaam karne kii urja detaa he
 Amino acid: taken immediately after exercise, acts as a protein
 agar aap body building kar rahe hai to in baton kaa dhyaan rakhana jaruri he:doctoron ke mutabik steroid kaa istemaal sirf visheshgy kii salaah par karnaa chahie
 But most of the youth take the help of diet supplements in the process of body building as soon as possible, which can have a bad effect on their health
 jaankaar maanate hai ki steroid yukt diet supplement khaane se napunsakata, harmen se judi bimaariyaan or heart atake ho saktaa he
 Taking steroids for health can disturb their mental balance
 steroid sharir kii rog pratirohak kshamta ko dhire-dhire khatm kar detaa he
 In such a situation, even a powerful body becomes hollow from inside
 steroid sharir main protein ko sakriy karata he
 This makes the muscles swell and the body looks good
 lekin ye shwet rakt kanikaon par bura asar daalata he, jisase pratirohak kshamta khatm hone lagati he
 Gym instructors themselves believe that diet supplements should not be used to build a body
 ji haa, body banaaie, feet rahiye lekin saath hi apni sehat ko lekar saavdhaan rahiye
 Otherwise, this desire for a good body can go ahead and ruin your life

 However, Shahrukh has become the king of romance through his romantic characters in films
 aaiye daalate hai shahrukh khan kii kuch aisi hi filmon par najar jinhone unhen romance kaa badshaah banaaya
 'dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' is one of the most beautiful love stories of Bollywood

 shahrukh aap sach main romance ke badshaah hai
 Read Shahrukh Khan's tweet here: ‘romance Like SRK’ uff the irony of this trend!! Let me see if i can do a romantic Valentines msg for all of u when i wake up
 - Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) February 13, 2017 asal jindagi main shahrukh behad sharmile hai, unhone ek intervyuu main bataaya tha ki unki patni gauri iklauti mahila hai jinhen unhone approach kiya tha
 However, Shahrukh has become the king of romance through his romantic characters in films
 aaiye daalate hai shahrukh khan kii kuch aisi hi filmon par najar jinhone unhen romance kaa badshaah banaaya
 'dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' is one of the most beautiful love stories of Bollywood
 film main shahrukh kaa kirdaar raaj ek charming ladkaa he jo simran (kaajol) kaa dil jeetne ke baad uske pita ko manaane landan se bharat aata he or apni baton se simran ke kadak pita kaa dil bhi jeet letaa he
 Raj's love for Simran became an example in this film
 aaj bhi kai ladkiyaan apane liye raaj ke sapane dekhati hai
 In 'dil To Pagal Hai', Rahul's love for Pooja, his reaction to the break up, his insistence on revealing his heart through his art, everything in this film is what makes Rahul attractive and this film Shah Rukh's musical and romantic avatar managed to win people's hearts
 iske baad 'kuch kuch hota he' ke rahul ne har kisi ko apana divaana banaaya
 Love and then marriage to new college girl Tina in the film
 uski maut ke baad apni puraani dost anjali se milanaa or phir ant main usase shaadi
 Whether as a college boy or as a businessman, Rahul ruled the hearts of all
 'vir jaaraa' kaa vir ke sapane ek samay par har ladki ne dekhe honge
 Veer who goes to Pakistan to meet his Zara and is also ready to face jail for years for his sake
 lekin kai saalon baad samiya siddiki kii koshishon se vir jail se chhootakar bharat aata he jahaan uski jaaraa uskaa intjaar kar rahi hoti he
 The comments shahrukh ne kai aisi filmein bhi kii jinamein unhen unka pyaar nahin mila par logon ko charm karne main vah kaamyaab rahe
 Then even if it is Sunil of 'kabhi Ya Kabhi Na' who tries till the end to come to him, but in the end he lets himself come and get married to Chris
 or phir 'kal ho na ho' kaa aman jo naina se bahut pyaar karata he par apni beemaari kii vajah se usase shaadi nahin kar saktaa
 He proposes to Naina for Rohit, tells his heart to Naina through Rohit
 in filmon ke jariye pyaar or romance kaa jo rup shahrukh ne hamen dikhaaya vah kaaphi alag he
 When 'DDLJ' insists on persuading the girl's family and not going against them, her charm in 'kuch Kuch Hota Hai', Shah Rukh's dedication as a lover in 'veer Zaara' was seen when 'kal Ho Na Ho' i dare to be separated from love for the sake of love
 shahrukh aap sach main romance ke badshaah hai
 'romance Like SRK' uff the irony of this trend !! Let me see if i can do a romantic valentines msg for all of u when i wake up
 'dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge' bollywood kii sabase khubasurat prem kahaniyon main se ek he
 Shah Rukh's character in the film Raj is a Charming boy who comes to India from London to convince his father after winning the heart of Simran (kajol) and also wins the heart of Simran's tough father
 is film main simran ke liye raaj kii mohabbat ek misaal ban gai
 Even today many girls dream of Raj for themselves
 'dil to pagal he' main puja ke pyaar main pade rahul kii mohabbat, dil tuutane par uskaa riection, apane art ke jariye apane dil kaa haal bataane kii uski jid, is film main sabakuch he jo rahul ko charming banaati hai or is film main shahrukh kaa musical or romantic avatar logon kaa dil jeetne main kaamyaab hua
 After this, Rahul of 'kuch Kuch Hota Hai' made everyone crazy
 film main college kii nai ladki tina se pyaar or phir shaadi
 After her death meet her old friend Anjali and then finally marry her
 chaahe college ke ladke ke rup main ho chaahe bijnesaman ke rup main rahul sabake dilon par raaj kiya
 Veer's dreams of 'veer Zara' must have been seen by every girl at one time
 vir jo apni jaaraa se milane pakistan jaataa he or uski khatir saalon tak jail kii sajaa bhugatne ko bhi taiyaar ho jaataa he
 But after many years Samiya Siddiqui's efforts leave India from Veer jail and come to India where she is waiting for him
 tippaniyan Shah Rukh also did many films in which he did not get his love but he managed to charm people
 phir chaahe 'kabhi haa kabhi na' kaa sunil ho jo aakhir tak koshish karata he ki aana uski ho jaae par ant main vah khud hi aana or kris kii shaadi hone detaa he
 And then Aman of 'kal Ho Na Ho' who loves Naina very much but cannot marry her due to his illness
 vah rohit ke liye naina ko prapoj karata he, rohit ke jariye apane dil kii baat naina se kahata he
 The form of love and romance Shahrukh showed us through these films is quite different
 'didlje' main ladki ke parivaar ko manaane or unke khilaaf nahin jane kii jid he to 'kuch kuch hota he' main unka charm, 'vir jaaraa' main ek premi ke rup main shahrukh kaa dadication najar aayaa to 'kal ho na ho' main pyaar kii khatir pyaar se hi alag ho jane kii himmat
 Shahrukh you are truly the king of romance

 In my childhood, Malgudi was really a city
 isi soch ke saath ham do teen pakke doston ne ek kasam khai thi ki jab bade ho kar paise kamaane lagenge, to sab mil kar puraa ek maheenaa malgudi main rahenge
 Where then did we know that in every house in the city where we live, a Malgudi dwells
 
 
 ek din jab rahaa nahin gaya or ro kar papa se jid kar di ki in garmi kii chhuttiyon main malgudi janaa he bas
 He explained very much that it is imaginary and not real
 uske baad se jab bhi apane paitrik gaanv janaa hota usee ko malgudi samaj kar khud ko 'swami' (swami and frends upanyaas kaa kirdaar) samaj lete the
 What makes Malgudi so alive and real is RK Narayan
 bharat main angreji sahitya ke sabase mahaan upanyaaskaaron main gine jane vaale narayan ne apni rachanaaon main jivan kaa jo chithran pesh kiya vah aaj bhi utana hi sarthak or jeevant he, jo rachana ke srijan ke samay tha
 T
 of Padmarag Films es
 Narasimhan decided to make a serial on Malgudi
 malgudi days kaarykram kii shuruyaat main jo chitra dikhte the, jaanate hai unhen banane vaale khud jane maane aar ke lakshmana hai, jo aar ke narayan ke bhai hai
 This serial was so effective that even today, whenever the subject is discussed, the same tune comes on everyone's mouth
 
 
 ta xxwrep 5 naa naa
 
 
 Narayan is one of the three famous English literary writers of the time
 unke alaava raaj anand or raja raav bhi us samay ke angreji lekhakon main apana alag hi sthaan rakhte hai
 These three writers are said to be the father of Indian English literature
 angreji upanyaas kii duniya main puri duniya main apni pahchaan banane vaale narayan narayan khud angreji main fail ho gaye the
 Yes, Narayan failed in English subject in graduation
 baad main dobaaraa pariksha dekar ve paas hue
 It was during these days that Narayan started writing
 aar ke narayan ne lekhan kii shuruyaat ‘da hindu’ main prakashit laghukthaon se kii
 How strong and sensitive Narayan's imagination is will be shown by reading his stories, novels
 ve har paristhiti ko is tarah chitrit karte ki pathak ke man main uski ek film si chalane lagati thi
 Perhaps that is why his novels and short stories were heavily filmed
 narayan ke upanyaas ‘guide’ ke liy unhen sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 World-class creator Narayan was decorated with Padma Vibhushan
 ve mausur ke yadav giri main kareeb do dashak tak rahe
 He moved to Chennai in 1990 due to illness and in 2001 he took his last breath
 jis makaan main narayan rahete the, wo makaan aaj bhi hai
 Narayan's followers want that his house be saved as an inheritance

 Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has named Virender Sehwag and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni as players in the Indian team who have the ability to dominate the bowlers of the rival team and turn the match with powerful batting
 harbhajan ne kaha, hamaari team main aise kai khilaadi hai, jo match kaa rukh palatney kii kshamta rakhte hai
 Virender Sehwag is one of them
 har baar vah ballebaaji karne jaataa he, to hamen pataa rahata he ki vah sabhi gendbaajon par dabadabaa banayega
 He has changed the stance of the match for us in difficult conditions

 His shot has plenty of energy to hit the ball around the field
 hamaari team ye donon aise khilaadi hai, jo match kaa rukh palat sakate hai
 Harbhajan described Pakistan off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq as an inspiration for his second, due to which he has made many players a victim in his career
 harbhajan ne kaha, jab main baccha tha or chandigarh main abhyaas karata tha to main sakalan mushtak ko doosraa phenkate hue dekha karata tha
 i used to watch them carefully and acquired the art of throwing perfect balls
 unhone kaha, main apane saathi arun verma (wicketiper) ke saath kaaphi kadaa abhyaas karata tha or apni takanic se gendbaaji karata tha
 i have worked hard for this wicket-taking ball
 harbhajan ne kaha, mujhe yaad he ki doosraa ne mere liye nahin, balki bharat ke liye kaaphi baar match kaa rukh badla he
 i remember when we were playing against Australia in Kolkata and they were taking away our bowlers
 maine achaanak ponting ko doosraa gend phenki or vah pagabaadha out ho gaya
 This 30-year-old player is only seven wickets away from taking 400 wickets in Test cricket
 unhone kaha, maine isi match main bharat ke liye apni pehali hetric (ponting, adam gilcrist or shen warn) hasil kii thi
 Certainly this changed the stance of the match

 The report reads: "in the committee's view, public screening of the film 'PM Narendra Modi' during the period of the code of conduct will benefit the special political party
 isliye film ko 19 may se pehle relies hone kii anumati nahin di ja sakati he

 chaahe blad pressure kii vajah se ho yaa kuch or amit shah ke bayaan se yah to sabit ho gaya ki maury ke mukhyamantri banane kaa chance bahut kam he
 It is not likely that Maurya himself will advance his name as Chief Minister
 phir kuch der ke baad whatsap main ab ek nayaa naam saamne aata he or vah he grahamantri rajnath singh
 After the result, Rajnath Singh's name was never in the discussion as Chief Minister but the message started spreading on whatsapp that Rajnath Singh will be the next Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 yah bhi khabar ai ki rajnath singh ke staff bhi lakhanu pahunch chuke he or taiyaari shuru ho chuki he
 Not only this, a message started coming in whatsapp that after Rajnath's departure, Arun Jaitley will now take over the charge of Home Minister and Piyush Goyal will be the Finance Minister
 lekin bijepi ke taraf se aisi koi bhi aupchaarik ghoshnaa nahin hui he
 The comments phir kuch der baad ek or naam charchaa main aa jaataa he - kanpur se saat baar vidhayak rahe satish mahana
 It was also discussed that Mahana was called to Delhi and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah
 ab kuch der baad koi saathi ne kaha ki satish mahana nahin banenge
 Then Dinesh Sharma's name came up on whatsapp quoting the source
 kuch der ke baad dinesh sharma kaa naam kaarij kar diya gaya or whatsap par ek or chaunkaane vaala naam tapakaa maniram, kaha gaya ki yah sangh prachaarak he
 Then we do a Google search on the name of Maniram, then it is also written about them that the RSS pracharak Maniram got rid of the kidnappers but we could not confirm whether it is the same Maniram or someone else
 phir maniram ke baad raamalaal kaa naam saamne aata he
 The message comes that quoting the sutra has revealed that Manoj Sinha's name is Confirm
 unke ilaake ke log khush hai ki vah 21 march ko shapath lenge
 Then a companion tells that an astrologer has told that a woman leader will become the Chief Minister and she is Smriti Irani and Smriti has also gone to visit Somnath temple
 yah sab naam sutara ke hawaale se whatsap par chal rahe hai
 Now you decide yourself who will become the Chief Minister
 agar whatrup kii maani jaae to uttar pradesh main das se bhi zyada naam mukhyamantri ke liye charchaa main he or un main se kuch naam 'shortlist' bhi ho chuke hai
 After the resounding victory in Uttar Pradesh, the four names of the BJP who were the most talked about in the media for the Chief Minister are Manoj Sinha, Dinesh Sharma, Keshav Prasad Maurya, Shrikant Sharma
 kuch din tak in naamon par kaaphi charchaa hui
 Meanwhile, Keshav Prasad Maurya's health deteriorated and he had to be hospitalized
 isse pehle amit shah ne yah elaan kar diya ki keshav prasad maury hi tay karenge koun hoga uttarapradesh kaa aglaa mukhyamantri
 Then came the news that Maurya is all right and this routine is checked up
 chunaav vyastata kii vajah se thodaa blad pressure badha hua he
 Whether it is due to blood pressure or something else, it is proved by Amit Shah's statement that there is little chance of Maurya becoming Chief Minister
 lagata nahin ki maury khud apana naam mukhyamantri ke rup main aage badhayenge
 Then after a while, a new name now appears in whatsapp and that is Home Minister Rajnath Singh
 nattejey ke baad rajnath singh kaa naam kabhi bhi mukhyamantri ke rup main charchaa main nahin tha lekin whatsap par yah sandesh failana laga ki rajnath singh uttar pradesh ke agle mukhyamantri honge
 It was also reported that the staff of Rajnath Singh have also reached Lucknow and preparations have started
 sirf itnaa nahin whatsap main yah bhi sandesh aane laga ki rajnath ke jane ke baad ab grahamantri kaa bhaar arun jetali sanbhaalenge or piyush goyal vittamantri honge
 But no such formal announcement has been made by the BJP
 tippaniyan After some time another name comes up in the discussion - Satish Mahana, a seven-time MLA from Kanpur
 yah bhi charchaa hui ki mahana ko dilli bulaayaa gaya or unki mulaakaat pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se hui
 Now some time later some fellow said that Satish will not become Mahana
 phir sutara ke hawaale se whatsap par dinesh sharma kaa naam aayaa
 After a while, Dinesh Sharma's name was dropped and another shocking name, Tapika Maniram, on whatsapp, was said to be a Sangh pracharak
 phir ham maniram kaa naam google search karte he to inke bare main yah bhi likhaa aata he ki aparankartaaon ko chakma dekar chute aresas prachaarak maniram lekin ham conform nahin kar paae yah vahi maniram he yaa doosraa koi he
 Then Ramlal's name appears after Maniram
 sandesh aata he ki sutara ke hawaale se pataa chalaa he ki manoj sinha kaa naam conform he
 People of his area are happy that he will take oath on 21 March
 phir ek saathi bataate he ki ek jyotish ne bataaya he ki koi mahila netaa mukhyamantri banegi or vah smriti irani he or smriti somnath mandir darshan karne bhi gayi he
 All these names are running on whatsapp quoting the sutra
 ab aap khud tay kar lijie mukhyamantri koun banegaa

 Here in Navarangpur district, a woman gave birth to a girl in an auto-rickshaw
 yah navjaat auto se phisalkar girakar gaya jisase uski maut ho gai
 The incident is related to Jamuna Bhatra of Chalanaguda village in Umarkot block of the district, who was undergoing labor pain since Monday morning
 uske pati madhu bhaatraa ne paas khospataljane ke liye 'janani express' ko kol kiya
 This service has been started to deliver pregnant women to a nearby hospital
 lekin ghanton tak intjaar karne ke baad jab jamuna kaa dard badhane laga to majaburi main is danpati ne auto-rickshaw bulaayaa
 The Civil Hospital at Umarkot is about 20 km from his village
 is kachche raste se danpati aspataal ja rahaa tha ki jamuna ne civil aspataal se kuch dur pehle hi auto-rickshaw main hibacchee ko janm de diya
 The woman had become so weak that she could not hold her newborn child properly and the child slipped and fell, causing her death
 sarkaar ne 'janani express' kii shuruyaat to kar di he lekin navrangpur jile main kareeb 362 gaanv aise hai jahaan yah suvidha nahin pahunchi he
 There are 221 villages in the district which do not have good roads

 bahujan samaaj party (basapa) supremeo mayawati ke baad rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke prati 'anargal' bayaanbaji karne vaale ek pravaktaa ko somvaar ko party se nikaal diya
 During the discussion on the motion of no confidence in the Lok Sabha on Friday, Congress President Rahul Gandhi hugged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then looked at one of his colleagues
 is par argedy ne unki tarif kii thi, lekin unki party ke ek rashtriya pravaktaa ko rahul kii aalochana karnaa mahangaa pad gaya he
 The criticism given to RJD by his national spokesperson Shankar Charan Tripathi for embracing the Prime Minister was so vicious that he was shown the only way out of the party
 darasal, rahul gandhi kii is harakat par shankar charan treepathi ne bayaan diya tha ki unka aacharan kaaphi bachakaana tha or 2019 main pradhanmantri banane kaa sapana dekhne vaale kisi vyakti ko shobhaa nahin detaa tha
 This statement of Shankar Charan Tripathi went to RJD exasperating and he first issued a show cause notice to him and sought his reply
 magar 2 dinon ke baad bhi jab unki taraf se koi jawaab nahin aayaa to aaj party ne unhen baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Significantly, Shankar Charan Tripathi is an astrologer and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav made him the national spokesperson of his party last year, despite which there was a lot of ruckus about his decision
 rahul ke khilaaf bayaan ke kaaran giri gazargedy se pehle basapa pramukh mayawati rahul gandhi ke prati 'anargal' bayaanbaji karne vaale party ke upaadhyaksh jaiprakash singh ko party se nishkasit kar chuki hai
 Soon after making this statement, Mayawati had removed Singh from all party posts on charges of indiscipline
 singh kii 'anargal' bayaanbaji ko basapa ke siddhanton ke khilaaf bataate hue unke viruddh anushaasanamak karrwai ke tahat yah faisla kiya gaya tha

 He said that by paying attention to Jharkhand in this way, his faith in the Central Government has increased
 unhone kaha, 'pradhanmantri ji aapke jivan or mere jivan main anek samanthaayen hai
 i heard your speech from Red Fort on 15 August very carefully and i am impressed by your sensitivity towards the poor
 saath hi main yah bhi bataanaa chahta hum ki aap ke kahe ke anusaar aap chaay bechakar jivan main sangharsh karte hue aaj desh ke pradhanmantri bane hai
 In the same way my mother washed me in people's homes and made me so that today i have become the Chief Minister of this state
 ' In the general meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi here today, on the lines of Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Hooda, the Chief Minister of Jharkhand Hemant Soren was also fiercely hooting, but he not only completed his speech but also gave the advice to the people to maintain the dignity of the stage

 The mantra goes like this: 'ramaye Rambhadraya Ramachandraya Vedhseerghunathaye Nathaye Sitaya: Pataye Namah:' There is another mantra: Rajivanayana dhare dhanu saik
 bhagat bipati bhanjan sukhadaayak
 
 suryoday se purv uthakar snaan aadi karke is mantra kii 7 maalaaen (108 dane kii) japana chahie
 At the end of every rosary, one should offer sacrifices in the fire of incense and guggul
 saaton maalaaen puri ho jane par us bhasma ko saavdhaanee se uthaakar rakh lenaa chahie
 Before engaging in work every day, the ash should be applied on the forehead
 jap karne or bhasma lagane se badi se badi baadhaaen dur hoti hai or har kaam main safalataa milti he
 This experiment is only for theists

 These elections can be held in early 2019
 lihaaja piem modi bhi is baat kaa puraa dhyaan rakhenge ki laal kile se vah apane kaarykaal kii sabhi uplabdhiyon ko puure desh ke saath saajha karenge

 piem modi apni vessite ke jariye bhi desh ke nagarikon se apil kar chuke hai ki vah desh hit main apane vichaar saajha karen or nae bharat ke udai main apni sahabhaagita ko darj karaaen
 In such a situation, on which issues can PM Modi express his opinion from the ramparts of the Red Fort?

 However, since its implementation, the Central Government and the State Governments are constantly trying to remove the ongoing flaws in it
 aise main sambhav he ki piem modi apane laal kile ke bhaashan main jiesti ko lekar kuch ahm ghoshnaaen karen

 kitna aayaa kaladhandesh main kaarobaar ke saath-saath sarkaar ke kaamkaaj main pardarshita laane ke liye beete 5 varshon ke dauraan kai ahm kadam uthaae gaye hai
 At the same time, the Modi government has also taken many important decisions to stop money laundering
 kya in faislon se desh main kaledhan par lagaam lagane main koi madad mili, is aashay bhi piem modi laal kile se kuch ahm khulaasa kar sakate hai

 sabake liye ghar kii yojanapiem modi ne 2022 tak desh main sabhi ke liye ghar banane kii yojana shuru kii he
 At the same time, the real estate sector has been the victim of recession during the last four years
 sector main rera jaise nae praavdhaan or kaledhan par lagaam ke baad mana ja rahaa he ki aam aadmi ke liye ghar kharidne kaa sapana puraa karnaa aasaan ho jayega
 In his Red Fort speech, PM Modi can include the house plan for everyone running across the country in his speech and make a big announcement before stepping into the general elections

 But the central government has tried during the last four years to introduce better and cheaper free health facility in the country at the lower level of its health network
 lihaaja, is baar laal kile se piem modi is maamle main bhi kuch ahm kah sakate hai

 vishwaas ne ek stage sho ke dauraan kaha tha ki pehle aspataalon main kerala se ain kaali-pili norse hotin thi, jinhen dekh log swaabhaavik rup se unhen sistar kehete the
 Kumar's statement received a lot of criticism
 kerala ke mukhyamantri oman chandi ne is aapattijanak bayaan par arvind kejariwal se maaphi maangane ko kaha
 However Kumar Vishwas later apologized for his objectionable statement
 kumaar vishwaas aam aadmi party ke rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy hai

 This movement is being driven by some natural force

 Our ears are very sensitive
 yun to hamaare kaan kii banaavat hi kuch aisi he ki ve kaaphi had tak surakshit rahete hai lekin kai baar inamen sankraman ho jaataa he
 Sometimes water goes into the ear, sometimes some foreign thing or some insect-moth
 jise nikaalane ke liye ham koi bhi cheez kaan main daal dete hai
 But earrings are very fine and very soft
 aise main chot lagane kaa khatra ho saktaa he, jisase sunne kii kshamta bhi ja sakati he
 Apart from this, some people also use sharp things to clean the earwax, which can be dangerous
 yearvax yun to kaan ko suraksha dene kaa kaam karata he lekin ise samay-samay par saaf karte rahanaa chahie
 But this work should be done carefully
 yun to bazaar main kai aise product maujuud hai jinke istemaal se kaan kii mile saaf kii ja sakati he lekin isamen khatra bhi he
 With the help of white vinegar and rubbing alcohol, you can clean the earwax if you want
 ye puri tarah natural tarika he
 The combination of these two works to give relief to earache
 iske alaava iske istemaal se sankraman bhi hone kaa khatra nahin rah jaataa
 White vinegar is an excellent anti-biotic, which does not allow infection
 agar aapke kaan main kisi tarah kaa koi sankraman ho gaya ho yaa phir pani chalaa gaya ho to bhi aap is upaay ko apana sakate hai
 Remedy: For this remedy you will need one teaspoon white vinegar and one teaspoon rubbing alcohol
 donon kaa ek-ek hissaa lekar acchhee tarah mila len
 Put this mixture in the ear by dropping it head-on and drop-by-drop
 din main do baar ye upaay karne se phayda hoga
 However, even after doing these remedies for three days, if you do not see any difference then it is better to go to the doctor

 aakhir acchhee baat thi ki desh kii prakritik sampada bhi batch rahi thi, aayran ore vagairah kisi kii zarurat nahin thi
 Steel made overseas was processed and used
 lekin in phaaydon ke baavjood aaj yahaan kii 130 main se bamushkil 25 se 30 milen hi thik se kaam kar rahi hai or 80 se zyada to puri tarah se band hai
 So what happened after that it came to light
 is vyavsaay kii mushkil shuru hui 2008 main jab beuro ouf indian standerds (biies) ne kaha ki steel ke liye uske sujhaaye maanakon par khara utarana jaruri he
 And since the old steel was being processed and used again
 isliye yahaan ke steel ko kam acha ghoshit kar diya gaya
 One slowdown, such a difficult scale from above - but still work like it was going on
 lekin pichley do saalon ne is vyavsaay kii qamar tod di he
 Ready-made goods are coming from China indiscriminately, which is much cheaper than their goods
 doosraa mandi kii vajah se desh main steel kii maang kam he, steel kii keemten bhi aantararashtriya bazaar main bahut giri hui hai
 In such a situation, the big steel producers of the country or, say, big companies have also come into the business of small cities
 kyonki vahaan bhi maang kam hone kii vajah se naye naye bazaar talaashe ja rahe hai
 They have broken the back of this small scale industry
 isi vajah se pichley do saalon main hi kareeb 15000 se zyada mazaduron ko duusare rojgaar kii talash kerani padi he or puure ilaake ki arthvyavastha tut rahi he
 The comments mil maalik bhi behad mushkil daur se guzar rahe hai
 They are also finding avenues in other businesses - after all, like big companies, they do not have the means to sell cheap nor have many money for marketing
 logon ko dar sataane laga he ki agar sarkaar ne is laghu udyog ko bachaane ke liye jald kadam na uthaaye to kahin is ilaake main berojgaare kii vajah se log kanoon vyavastha bigaadane jaise chori or anya kaamon main na lipt hone lagen
 But despite these benefits, barely 25 to 30 mills out of 130 are functioning properly and more than 80 are completely closed
 to aakhir kya hua ki ye naubat aa gai
 The business's difficulty began in 2008 when the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) said it was necessary for steel to meet its suggested standards
 or chunki purana steel process karke dobaaraa upyog main laayaa ja rahaa tha
 Hence the steel here was declared less good
 ek to mandi, upar se is tarah ke mushkil paimaane - lekin phir bhi kaam jaise taise chal rahaa tha
 But the last two years have broken the back of this business
 dhadlle se china se taiyaar maal aa rahaa he jo inke maal se behad sasta he
 Second, steel demand in the country is low due to recession, steel prices have also fallen in the international market
 aise main desh ke bade bade steel utpaadak yaa yun kahen ki badi badi companiyaan bhi ab chote shaharon ke vyavsaay main aa gai hai
 Because there are less demand, new markets are being discovered
 inhone is laghu udyog kii qamar hi tod di he
 For this reason, in the last two years alone, more than 15000 workers have had to look for other employment and the economy of the entire region is collapsing
 tippaniyan Mill owners are also going through a very difficult period
 wo bhi anya vyavsaayon main raste dhund rahe hai - aakhir badi companiyon kii tarah unke paas sasta bechney kaa zariyaa nahin he or na hi marketing ke liye dheron paise
 People are starting to fear that if the government does not take quick steps to save this small scale industry, then due to unemployment in this area, people will not indulge in theft and other activities like spoiling law and order

 In fact, after the nationwide atmosphere against corruption and Anna's movement, the activism of Lokayuktas has increased considerably
 unke daftaron main shikayaton kii taadaad bhi badhati ja rahi he
 In Uttar Pradesh, only 30 to 40 percent of the complaints have come in the Lokayukta office
 is saal 20 sitambar tak shikayaton kii sankhya 2,786 tak pahunch gai thi, jabaki beete varsh 31 disambar tak 2,622 shikaayatein pahunchi thim

 However, limited rights and lack of appropriate staff have tied the hands of the Lokayuktas
 masalan, jahaan karnataka or madhya pradesh ke lokayuktaon kaa apana police bal or staff he, vahiin chhattisgarh or uttar pradesh main unke paas koi jaanch agency nahin he
 Mehrotra says that he has only two deputy sps and one Additional District Judge (ADJ) rank officer
 aise main zyaadaatar maamalon kii jaanch unhen khud kerani padati he
 Over the years, under the MGNREGA, there has been considerable government funding in the village and there has been a large amount of monkey funding
 lekin isaki jaanch lokayukta nahin kar sakate
 Justice Mehrotra says that in cases of corruption involving the village head, they do not have the right to investigate
 yahi nahin, sarkaar ke mantriyon ke khilaaf lokayukta jaanch kar sakate hai, par mukhyamantri ke maamle par kanoon khamosh he
 The Lokayuktas cannot investigate corruption in state universities or subsidized educational institutions due to being bound by the laws of law
 uttar pradesh ke lokayukta karyaalay ke janasuchana adhikari arvind kumaar singhl kehete hai, ''jab koi aisi shikaayat aati he, jisaki jaanch lokayukta nahin kar sakate to use sambandhit jile ke jiladhikari ko bhej diya jaataa he
 "by the way, the Lokayukta cannot initiate an investigation on his own knowing about the corruption case
 uttar pradesh main lokayukta jaanch ke daayre main philhal mantri, vidhayak, nagar nigamon ke mahayor or parshad, nagarpalika parishad or nagar panchayat ke adhyaksh tathaa sadsy, jila panchayat ke adhyaksh or sadsy, sabhi sarkari vibhaagon tathaa companiyon ke adhikari evam karmchaaree aate hai
 An official of the Lokayukta office says that sometimes the investigation takes three to four years
 madhya pradesh main sthiti kuch alag he
 The Lokayukta is working as a strong organization there
 uske paas police mahanideshak se lekar nichle str tak apana staff he
 Justice Navelkar recently summoned the state Home Minister and Home Secretary to his office and directed him to provide staff of SP level officers and 12 other police officers for the new divisions in Rewa, Shahdol and Chhindwara
 lekin jaruri nahin ki sarkari vibhaag lokayukta kii sune hi
 For example, more than 350 cases against officers and employees of the Urban Administration Department are pending in the Lokayukta but the Department does not send information to the Lokayukta
 chhattisgarh ke lokayukta ne to report main afsos jataayaa ki sarkaar unki siforeeshon par amal nahin karti
 However, recent developments have proved that this institution is also able to crack down on corruption if it gets sufficient resources and freedom to work
 -saath main jayshri pingale or samir garg Jharkhand Assembly Election 2019: On Saturday evening in Jharkhand politics, it was decided that BJP will not give ticket to its senior minister Saryu Rai
 raay ke tikat par suspence khud unhone yah kah kar khatm kiya ki lagata he party ke kendriya netritv ko rashtriya or antarrashtriya samasya se nipatane main itnaa samay lag rahaa he ki unhen jamshedpur pashchim se ummidavaar koun ho tay karne kaa samay nahin he
 Therefore, he can now come to the field against Chief Minister Raghubar Das after considering with his supporters
 lekin jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki sarayu raay jinhone ab tak do-do mukhya mantriyon - lalu yadav or madhu kodaa ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke maamle ko ujagar kar jail bhijwane main sakriy bhoomika nibhaai thi, unka tikat katnaa is aadhaar par tay tha ki mukhyamantri raghubar das (raghubar Das) or party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah (amith Shah) unhen naapsand karte the
 One of the reasons for this has been publicly criticizing Chief Minister Das and he has almost stopped attending cabinet meetings
 jharkhand main bijepi pehali baar ajasu se puri tarah juda hokar vidhansabha chunaav ladegilekin party kii chunaav samiti kii baithak main amit shah ne unke prati apana virodh khul kar zaahir kiya tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also present in this meeting and Shah said that Rai had released one of his books to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 haalanki bihar bhaajapa ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki raay or nitish kumaar kii mitrataa jagazahir he
 Jharkhand: BJP fielded former Congress state president Sukhdev Bhagat from Lohardaga, but when Nitish Kumar released the book in December 2017, the NDA government was formed in Bihar
 haa, ye baat alag he ki jab 2013 main nitish kumaar ke saath sambandh tut gayi the or bihar main bijepi ke varisht netaa susheel modi hameshaa chaara ghotaale main nitish kumaar ko aaropee banane kii maang karte the, tab sarayu raay ne saarvajanik rup se kaha tha ki nitish kumaar kaa chaara ghotaale main koi lenaa dena nahin he or ye maang raajnneetik pratishodh se kii ja rahi he jo galat he
 Sushil Modi, however, tried not to get Rai a ticket in the last election
 baharhaal bhaajapa chunaav samiti ke sadasyon ko is baat kaa bhram nahin tha ki bhale raay kaa tikat hold par ho lekin amit shah ko unki nitish kumaar se dosti nagavar guzari he
 Jharkhand Assembly Election: BJP and Congress launched their slogans but Jharkhand BJP leaders believe that a message has been given to the party like Bhanu Pratap Sahi, accused of the Madhu Koda scam by cutting the ticket of Rai, that the party has raised the issue of corruption Has reached an agreement
 unhen is baat kii bhi parvaah nahin ki vipaksh ise mudda banaakar janata ke saamne gheregi
 Such a mutually contradictory decision may have to be borne at the time of election
 haalanki party ke netaa is baat ko lekar aashwast hai ki nirdaleey maidan main rahane ke kaaran sarayu raay chunaav main to koi khaas asar nahin daalenge
 But if he made public any thing on the issue of corruption after the election, then the problem of Chief Minister Raghubar Das can be increased
 unhen chunavi ranneeti banane main maahir shaks mana jaataa he
 When he became the mastermind of the historic victory of the Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself won him the title of man of the match
 ve swabhaav se ruukhe lekin behad mukhar or kaam ke prati jujharu hai
 These days, his strategy has focused only on the Bihar assembly elections
 unhen ehsaas he ki yah chunaav kai myanon main loksabhaa or uske baad ke chunaavon se alag he jo desh or bijepi kii raajnneeti kii nai patakatha likhegaa
 Watching the live telecast of Prime Minister Modi's rally with the TV turned off, BJP national president Amit Shah had a special conversation with India Today editor Anshuman Tiwari and special correspondent Santosh Kumar at his official residence at 11 Akbar Road 
 unhone bijepi kaa yashogaan karne kii bajaae un tamaam tikhe sawaalon kaa sahajata se jawaab diya, jisko lekar party lagaataar nishane par he
 Here is the excerpt from his talks on various issues like Bihar's electoral strategy including reservation, government, bureaucracy, beef, organization, familyism, black money, U-turn on Aadhar card: Whatever the outcome of Bihar election, what will be the impact on the organization and the government? There may be doubt in your mind about main bihar main 22 jilon main hokar aayaa hum
 i have met millions of people, there is a big wave in favor of BJP and by the third phase elections, the wave will turn into a tsunami
 hamaari jeet sunishchit he
 What will be its effect on BJP, this assessment can be done only after the elections
 bijepi jeet ke prati aashwast he to itani takat kyon jhonkani padi he?mujhe lagata he ki chunaav abhiyaan ko dekhne kaa yah najariya sahi nahin he
 We are a party based on ideology
 chunaav hamaare liye mahotsav hota he, chunaav hamaare vichaaron or siddhanton ko zyada se zyada logon tak pahunchane kaa ek jariya hota he
 It does not always mean electoral victory or defeat
 jab jansangh ke jamaane main hamaari jamaanat jabt ho jaati thi tab bhi jitne kaaryakarta the, itnaa hi parishram karte the
 The same question was asked to me everywhere in UP, Gujarat, Maharashtra but everywhere we live
 zyada logon ko sampark main lagaana bahupaksheeya loktantric vyavastha ke liye acchhee baat he
 Amit Shah is said to have expertise in the matter of micro management
 to dilli chunaav or bihar chunaav ke micro management main kya antar he?dekhie, donon rajya hi alag prakaar ke hai
 Delhi is 85 percent urban, while Bihar is 85 percent rural
 swaabhaavik rup se donon kii ranneeti main badlaav hoga
 The election of Bihar had started on the issue of development, but later came to caste
 kya aapako lagata he ki matdaan hote-hote jati hi ahm ho jaaegi or vikaas peeche chhot jayega?jahaan tak bijepi kaa sawaal he to saare bhaashanon, conference kaa vishleshan kar lijie to hamane vikaas ko hi mudda banaaya he
 Since there has been an unholy alliance in Bihar, which the country knows as the 15-year-old Jangraj, and BJP ended it with Nitish Kumar
 ab nitish us jangalraj ke mukhiya ke saath gathbandhan kar chuke hai
 So Bihar cannot be developed by this alliance, this is what we mean to say
 to kya bijepi kii ranneeti main jati koi factor nahin rahaa he, tikat bantwaare se lekar sabhi kuch vikaas par hi rahaa?aaj bijepi kaa sanghathan kul milakar sarv samaveshak he
 In which every part of society is represented
 swaabhaavik rup se ham jitau ko ek paimaana maanate hai kyonki hamaare paas samaaj ke sabhi tabakon ke kaaryakarta-netaa uplabdh hai to jitau ummidavaar main swaabhaavik rup se jati aa jaati he, lekin vah hamaara kaaryakarta he
 But in the number of candidates in Bihar, you gave tickets to 40% upper castes, whose population is 16%? This shows that we have not given importance to caste
 (thodaa rukkar
 
 ) aap samaj rahe hai naa main kya kah rahaa hum
 In Bihar, there is a picture of different polarization among Dalits, obcs
 
 
 is dhruvikaran kii baat lutiuns jone tak hi he, neeche nahin
 If you want to see this then i explain
 atipichhadon, daliton or mahadaliton ko tikat bijepi ke ghatak dalon ne zyada diya he
 Since the Mahagathbandhan has given a large number of tickets to people of the same caste and does not mix it with the most backward, they give figures by backward and very backward and people do not go deep, so there is so much confusion
 chunaav kii disha aarakshan or gomance kii bahes kii taraf mudati dikh rahi he
 One side is talking about reservation and the other side is choosing to choose between eating beef and non-eaters
 aap bataaie, gomance kaa mudda kisne uthaaya? ham par kyon aarope kar rahe hai
 We did not raise the issue of beef to appease, we just responded
 lekin upi se uthaa mudda bihar pahunchaa or mudda ban gaya
 
 
 So what did we pick? What did the BJP worker raise? We did not raise the issue of beef
 agar saamne vaala koi bayaan degaa to ham bhi jawaab denge
 The statement of the Sangh chief came on the reservation
 
 
 aarakshan kaa mudda bhi hamane nahin uthaaya
 Bhagwat ji did not raise any such issue, he has already made it clear on behalf of the Sangh
 jammu-kashmir vidhansabha main bijepi ke vidhayakon ne ek nirdaleey vidhayak ko vidhansabha ke bheetar bif khaane ke maamle main peet diya, yah koun si samskruti he?bijepi vidhanmandalon or sansad ke sadanon main is tarah kii ghatana kii ninda karti he, bhatrsana karti he
 We do not support this
 dadri kii ghatana par bayaanbaji hui, phir piem modi ko kahana padaa ki netaaon kii bayaanbaji par dhyaan nahin dena chahie to sawaal yah he ki sheersh netritv jab asahmati jataa rahaa he, phir bhi 15 maheenon main kuch saansad-netaa aisi bayaanbaji karte rahe hai
 So is there a lack of discipline in the party? Who went to Dadri first after the incident? Rahul went to Gandhi, then to Arvind Kejriwal, later to Akbaruddin Owaisi
 bijepi kii ore se ek hi netaa gaye mahesh sharma jo vahaan ke sthaneey saansad hai
 Who is making the point? Yogi Adityanath's statement in Banaras that if goat blood can be shed then what is the objection in idol immersion? See, Yogi ji has his own opinion
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki vahaan santon par lathi charge nahin hona chahie tha
 The administration should have maintained decorum
 aapane kaha tha ki bif ek food habit ho saktaa he, lekin bhaawanaaon kaa khyaal rakhana chahie
 Consent against cow slaughter was also said about the law, like some states are made
 to kya centre sarkaar koi rashtriya kanoon kaa masauda laa rahi he?bijepi kii jahaan-jahaan rajya sarkarein hai vahaan gohatya par pratibandh to lagaaya hi he
 i think if we are winning the state one by one slowly then it will be everywhere itself
 (hansate hue
 
 
 ) If you win Bihar then it will be there too
 bihar main aap logon ne nitish se zyada lalu par hamalaa kiya he
 Is the issue not possible because of Nitish's image? No, we feel that the media either does not understand our words or does not want to understand even by understanding
 hamaara mudda yahi he ki nitish jab lalu ke saath jate hai to vikaas nahin ho saktaa
 If Nitish Kumar could have developed with Lalu, why did they break up? They were also there earlier
 jangalraj kii vajah se alag hue
 What is happening today, what change has come? sirf satta praapt karne ke liye jarurat he
 You are saying that your victory is easy
 140-150 siten milengi
 But what is the reason that the graph of Nitish's popularity seems to be far ahead
 aapaki najar main aisa mahatvapurn kaaran kya he ki log bijepi ko vot karenge or nitish ko nahin?main maanata hum ki ek kandhe par lalu kaa aparaadh or jangalraj or duusare kandhe par congress kaa 12 lakh karod ru
 If you talk about development with corruption, then it will look very hollow
 bihar main aaj yahi janata mahasoos kar rahi he
 Naturally he has a good track record about BJP
 madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, gujarat, rajasthan, goa, maharashtra, haryana, jharkhand main jite
 a year ago, Jharkhand was ranked 29th in the Ease of Doing Business Index, Bihar was at number 27, but within a year, Jharkhand came at number three, and Bihar is there
 bijepi kaa yah trek record he
 There is confusion about the candidate for the Chief Minister, Giriraj Singh said that there will be no upper caste Chief Minister
 koi uhapoh nahin he
 The BJP is going to become the Chief Minister and will be elected by the NDA Legislature Party and the BJP Parliamentary Board
 lekin kya siem koi bhi ho saktaa he, pichhadaa yaa savarna jaisi koi baat nahin he?maine kaha ki abhi koi baat tay nahin he
 Nitish Kumar had said that if there are states like bjp-ruled Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh beyond Bihar in terms of crime, then Jungleraj cannot be talked about
 mukademe registerd honge tabhi to aankade aaenge
 Crime is not allowed to be registered there
 aap log 25 saal ke nitish-lalu raaj par hamalaa kar rahe hai, lekin usamen bijepi bhi saat saal nitish ke saath rahi he
 Whatever the government is, most of its say depends on the head of the government
 phir bhi saat saal main kaaphi vikaas hua tha
 Development took place as long as the BJP remained
 aap baad ke do saal ke aankade nikaal kar dekh lijie vikaas main lagbhag 82 fisadi kii giravat he or aparaadh kii dar main 40 fisadi kii vruddhi he
 Who is bjp's biggest rival among Nitish and Lalu? i think
 
 
 
 
 sab saath main hi he
 It is not good to see them separately
 nitish ji ko lalu se alag karke nahin dekhnaa chahie
 BJP has always raised the question that other political parties distribute laptops etc
 for free, but the party has also talked about scooters, petrol, houses etc
 in Bihar, why this change in thinking? Bihar's per capita income is down today Is ranked first
 hamaara vijan dastavej bihar ke har kshetra or har vyakti ke vikaas ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaya he
 In the development of every field, electricity, pure drinking water, irrigation, procurement of paddy at support price, education, improving power system, stop duplication in examinations, bring business to industry, giving employment, all these things are also in the vision document
 chunki prati vyakti aay kam he to logon ko samaan manch dene ke liye vyaktigat sahaayta dena bihar jaise rajya main bahut jaruri he
 Bihar is not Gujarat
 isliye bijepi ne puure bihar ke kshetra kaa vikaas or us vikaas ko or neeche le jaakar sarv samaveshak banane vaala ek vyapak vijan dastavej banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 It should not be associated with election promises
 bihar main hytech waar room banaaya he or aap dilli main baithkar bhi sidhi nigaraanee kar rahe hai, jabaki bihar main aapane kaha ki 85 fisadi gramin kshetra he
 How do you manage it? See, we have taken the help of technology for this
 hamaare teen prakaar ke abhiyaan chale haih ek, har booth ke gathan ke liye 243 vidhansabha main purnakalik pichley ek saal se kaam kar rahe hai; doosraa, prachaar kaa he, jisamen hamane har booth par paanch-paanch waal painting kiye hai

 is baar hamane prachaar main sabase zyada matadaataaon se sampark kii ranneeti apanaai he
 In a 40-day campaign, we are reaching one crore voters directly
 puri monitering bihar main hamaare waar room se ho rahi he
 i would like to say in particular that our in-charge Bhupendra Yadav and election incharge Anant Kumar have worked very hard
 bihar kii puri team ne pradesh se lekar booth tak ekajute hokar ise safal karne main lagi he tab jaakar bahut acha maahaul bijepi ke paksh main dikhaai de rahaa he
 How much does the RSS play in this election? It should be in every election
 bijepi ne vipaksh main rahete hue aadhaar card kii aalochana kii thi, yashavanth sinha kii adhyakshata vaali sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne iskaa bill khaarij kar diya tha, smriti irani ne ise rashtriya suraksha ke khilaaf or anant kumaar ne sibiai jaanch or ise shuru karne waalon par aapraadhik mukademe kii baat kii thi
 Now why change the attitude? i do not know Anant Kumar's statement
 lekin jab yah shuru hua to main gujarat kaa grih mantri tha
 i had written a letter to the Prime Minister of the country that the provision of citizenship on the basis of Aadhaar card is not right and now that provision is not in it
 hamaara rukh rashtriya suraksha tak hi simit tha
 There is a lot of pressure on banks about the Mudra scheme and the NPA is expected to increase substantially due to guarantees and loans without the necessary documents
 yah lone mela nahin he

 Never take a small loan NPA

 kaale dhan ke mudde par bijepi kaaphi asamanjas main rahi
 The statement was given in the first election, now when the government opened the window of black money, it completely flopped
 aapako lagata he ki is mudde par sahi taiyaari nahin hui?hamaari sarkaar banane ke baad pehali cabinet kaa pehla prastaav kaale dhan par esaity kaa paas kiya
 The SIT was made in a week and all the information was provided to the SIT
 duniya bhar main jahaan-jahaan piem or vitt mantri gaye, kaale dhan par duniya bhar main ek saajha man banane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Changes in laws were necessary for this, the government also did that
 uske baad main ham ek kanoon lekar aae
 In which after the constitution was made, for the first time in India the provision for punishment for financial irregularities was made
 kathor se kathor kanoon lekar bijepi kii sarkaar ai
 But if the law is already in force, even if there was black money five years ago, it should be punished
 lekin nyaay kaa siddhant kahata he ki unako waapas laane ke liye ek rasta dikhaaya jaae
 That is, the government gave an opportunity to make a mistake, but now come
 ab agar kam aae hai to kanoon aage apana kaam karegaa
 Arun Jaitley said that there is no black money abroad, most of the black money is in India, earlier there was a debate that big budget of India is in tax haven
 nahin, jetali ji ne aisa nahin kaha, maine unke bhaashan ko padhaa he or khud unase baat bhi kii he
 They have said that black money is more in India than abroad
 desh ke baahar jo kaala dhan jaataa he vah hawala ke jariye jaataa he or desh main jo kaala dhan he vah tex chori kaa he
 There is a big difference between the two black money
 aapane pehali baar obisi morcha banaaya he, kya yah bhi anya morche kii tarah hoga yaa aapaki kuch alag soch he?koi alag soch nahin he
 Just as there is youth, women, minority front, so is OBC front
 swaabhaavik taur se obisi jati ke sanghathan ke liye kaam karegaa
 If we look at the existing structure of the organization, a lot becomes focused on one person, so there is talk of decentralization
 11 karod sadsy koi ek vyannti nahin bana saktaa

 kya yah aankada kam he?bihar chunaav ko aap apane liye kitni badi chunauti ke rup main dekhte hai kyonki rashtriya adhyaksh kaa chunaav hone vaala he, agar aapako doosraa turm miltaa he to kya badlaav karnaa chahenge?kisi chunauti? rashtriya adhyaksh kaa chunaav kisi anya party ke liye ek ghatana ho sakati he
 We have it here every two years
 ek hi party aisi he ki jahaan sanghathanaatmak chunaav samay par hote hai
 Particular planning is not a matter, the party is a continuous process, it goes on
 gujarat kaa jo patidaar andolan he us par aapaki apni rajnatik soch kya he? yah andolan kitna badhegaa kyonki pichhadon main iskaa judaav bad rahaa he
 i cannot have any personal thinking or policy

 i believe that the Gujarat unit is handling it properly
 ek ghatana hui he gujarat ikai jise thik se dekh rahi he
 a post on social media about Aam Aadmi Party candidate Raghav Chadha from South East Delhi is going viral
 ek akhbaar kii cliping ke jariye yah daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki chaddha ne kaha he ki agar punjabi voter unka saath den to ve dehati jat-gurjaron or bihariyon ko dhul chataa denge
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) did not find any such statement publicly in Raghav Chadha's investigation
 viral post kaa archivd varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 This newspaper clipping is becoming increasingly shared on Facebook and Twitter
 isamen chhapi khabar kaa sheershak he: "punjabi voter meraa saath den to dehati jat-gurjar or bihariyon ko dhul chata duungaa- raghav chaddha"
 Through this whole news, an attempt has been made to show Chadha against Jats, Gurjars and Bihar
 viral bayaan ke bare main jab hamane internet par khoj shuru kii to hamen aisi koi media report nahin mili jisase chaddha ke aise bayaan kii pushti ho
 However, we did find a post on Chadha's official Facebook account, in which he himself has denied this viral statement
 11 may ko chaddha ne fasebuk post par likhaa: "ye khabar bilkul juthi he, is photoshop se banaai news par vishwaas naa karen
 If you see it on Facebook, report it immediately
 "viral post kii bhashaa bhi sandehaaspad he
 There are many mistakes in this post like 'chata' is written as 'chata' in the title of the news
 iske alaava bhi puri khabar main bahut sari galtiyaan hai
 Generally, there is no scope for such mistakes in newspapers
 is khabar ke paragraph bhi dhang se aline nahin kiye gaye hai
 Where the news ends, even some places appear empty
 amuman akhbaar main is tarah khabar khatm hone ke baad jagah nahin chodi jaati
 Not only this, there is neither dateline nor byline nor any agency is mentioned on this news
 akhbaar main har khabar ke saath yaa to use likhane vaale reporter kaa naam yaa phir agency, beuro yaa kisi na kisi sorce kaa naam hota he
 Overall, at first glance, this clipping seems fake, while Raghav himself has denied this statement

 rashtraputra, chandrashekhar aaazaad par aadhaarit film he
 It features his personality and gratitude
 lekin is film kii sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki isamen aaazaad ko mahatma gandhi kaa kattar virdohi bataaya gaya he
 Or rather, this film is Gandhi against Azad
 is film ke lekhak-nirdeshak aaazaad kaa bhi maananaa he ki gandhi ne aaazaad ke saath nyaay nahin kiya tha jisase film ko us par zyada focus kiya gaya he
 He said, 'I thought of making a film on Chandrashekhar Azad because i was influenced by him since childhood
 maine apana naam bhi aaazaad rakhaa
 Among the revolutionaries of the country, more films have been made on Bhagat Singh
 lekin aaazaad par unke vyaktitv or krititv ko lekar filmein nahin bani hai
 He says, 'I did research for two years after completing my studies from Sainik School to make a film on this great revolutionary
 phir maine sochaa ki jis soch ke saath yah film bananaa chahta hum, use duusare lekhak or nirdeshak film main puraa nahin kar paaenge
 Then i wrote and directed the script myself
 aaazaad kii bhoomika ke liye bhi khud ko taiyaar kiya
 i increased my weight by 15 kg
 ' ab jab film relies ke liye taiyaar ho gai he to ve khush hai ki jis makasad se banaai usamen ve safal hai
 They have produced it in 26 languages
 sanskrit sahit paanch bhashaaon main shooting kii he to 21 bhashaaon main dab kiya he
 The film is planned for release next month on 14 September
 sanskrit ke darshak nahin hai to ise theatre main kaise relies kar paaenge?is sawaal par ve kehete hai, `da bambe takies studios iske nirmaataa hai or distributor bhi hai
 Therefore, there is no problem in getting the theater
 yah bhi sach he ki aaj apane hi desh main sanskrit kii haalat bahut kharaab he
 But if even a Sanskrit lover sees this film, then the purpose of making his film will be fulfilled
 ' vaise, aaazaad is film kaa bajet bataane se inkaar karte hai
 He says that only after the release of the film, the producers will be able to tell its budget

 lekin unke kuch kaamon se ve naaraaz the
 Godse was later hanged
 desh ke bantwaare ke dard ko kai log jhel nahin paae the
 Today, our Benares district has been divided into Chandauli and Bhadohi districts
 jisase main bhi dukhi hum
 The one who was a Banarasi was cut off from Bhadohi, the people of Kashi, the city of salvation, now belonged to Chandauli
 ve kehete hai ki angrejon ne jaat ke aadhaar par hamaare samaaj ko baanta tha
 As a result, we are suffering, reservation is being demanded
 log ab raashtra ke bare main kam sochate hai jabaki raashtra he to humlog hai
 With this film, we will try to spread Azad's thinking of nationalism
 ve bataate hai ki is film kii elahabaad, kanpur, lakhanu, banaras, jhaansi main shooting kii gai
 Has shown the personality of Azad
 aaazaad kii maut ke baad unki kahani ko todaa-maroda gaya
 Azad's ideology was different
 aaazaad kii maut ko lekar vivaad he lekin film dekhne ke baad asal baat pataa chalegi
 The film depicts Azad as an inspiration to young revolutionaries
 bhagat singh or sukhdev bhi unase prerit hokar unke paas aae the
 The film also focuses on why Subhash Chandra Bose and Lala Lajpat Rai were angry with Gandhi
 vande maataram gane ko vishesh rup se film ke liye shoot kiya gaya he
 Yashpal's books have also been used for this film
 aaazaad maanate hai ki film unke liye vyavsaay nahin he
 It is a literary work
 ve kehete hai, ek filmmekar kisi bhi film ke jariye saahitiyik yuddh hi ladata he

 Sachin Tendulkar has also made many sensational revelations in his autobiography 'playing it My Way', one of which was that Greg Chappell wanted Rahul Dravid to be removed and captained before the 2007 Cricket World Cup
 sachin tendulkar likhte hai ki greg chapel ek baar unke ghar aae the, or baton hi baton main unhone kaha, "ham log saath milakar bhartiya cricket par varshon raaj karte rah sakate hai
 
 
 Help me take the reins of captaincy from Rahul Dravid
 
 
 main hairaan rah gaya

" 
 
 worldcup shuru hone main kuch hi maheene bache the
 
 
 The coach had no respect for the captain

 Also, Greg Chappell wanted to make many changes to the team, which the senior players never liked

 For the last two decades or more, human development indicators have not improved significantly
 haalanki yah ahm he ki sarkaron ne haashie ke samoohon, alpsankhyakon vagairah ko apane aupchaarik tantra ke jariye madad pahunchane ke liye swasthya, shiksha, aarthik avasar main sudhaar ke liye sevaayen muhaiyaa karai hai
 Small local markets have been created for the exchange of goods and services

 Such a large number can be called minorities only when they are deprived and tortured
 musalamaanon main alpsankhyak hone kaa yah ehsaas 30 saal pehle '80 ke dashak main hindu dakshinpanthi takaton ke badhate dabadabe ke saath gaharaaya
 To understand the Muslim identity more clearly, we have to look into 1986 and subsequent years
 us samay ham shahbaano maamle, salmaan rushdi kii kitaab par pabandi or obisi aarakshan ke saath hindutvvaadi takaton ke us rashtravyapee andolan ke gavaah bane, jisaki bulandi ayodhya main puraani babari masjid ke dhahaae jane main dikhi
 When all this was going on in the interior of India, only then did the Muslim majority in the Kashmir Valley break their ambiguous image and revolt against the Center
 siyaasi muddon kaa pheraapachaas se lekar '80 ke dashak tak muslim siyasat urdu ke ird-gird gumti thi lekin angreji or hindi main padhi ek puri peedi ke aa jane se yah masalaa khatm ho gaya
 Aligarh Muslim University's minority status case also came to an end with the government's submission of subpoena to the court
 yah dukhati rag is saal phir ched di gai he kyonki uttar pradesh main agle saal ke shuru main chunaav hone vaale hai
 Then, let's explore the eighties
 us vakt bahes personal lau or shiksha, naukariyon tathaa raajnneeti main anupatik pratinidhitiv kii ore mud gai thi
 It sparked so much that the BJP gained strength by appeasing appeasement
 personal lau kaa mudda to sulagta rahaa or jab bhi bijepi satta main aati he yah mudda lapten pakadaaey lagata he
 But a historical report made the appeasement debate meaningless with its results that most Indian Muslims are living in a grave predicament
 nyaayamurti rajendra sachhar cameti ne 2007 main sarkari aankadon se khulaasa kiya ki musalmaan har kshetra main haashie par hai
 The share of Muslims, especially in government and formal jobs, school-universities and political posts, was found to be very low
 unki aamadani duusare samoohon se kam he
 The help of banks and other financial institutions also reaches them less
 unke bachche skulon main kam saal gujaarte hai or unamem sakshartaa dar bhi kam he
 a small amount of them are able to reach the army or police forces
 shahari ilaakon main sabase badi sankhya main kareeb 46 fisadi musalmaan swa-rojgaar par nirbhar hai
 Just 30 in cities
 4 fisadi musalmaan hi vetanbhogi naukariyon main hai, jo duusare samoohon ke mukaable sabase kam taadaad he
 By the late eighties, Muslims were divided
 bakaul hasan sarur, siyaasi or majahabi maamalon main udaar or sahishnu log ''achche musalmaan" kehalaae or dakiyanoosee tathaa kattar nazariye vaale ''bure musalmaan" ho gaye
 By now cricket had become the national obsession of India and these evil Muslims started supporting the Pakistani team
 khadi deshon kii arthvyavastha oochaal le rahi thi
 So, in Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other parts of the country, new mosques started to be built with modern sound system, which led to some loud voices

 The Mandal Commission gave a new identity to the backward castes and two important movements were seen emerging in these two most populous states

 Three decades of tragedy, the thirty years have been filled with tragedy

 It also has some sentimental accounts when Shakari, history, shared residences, shared proverbs, shared hindu-muslim or ganga-jamuni culture under the Awadh of Naqvi flowed and an economic balance was a sign of dignity and nobility
 haalanki vahi avadh unke hi jivan main baari khun-kharabe vaale jang ke maidan main tabdeel ho gaya or babari masjid dhaha di gai
 However, after Indira Gandhi's return to power in '80, her Hindu agenda came out openly, in which Sikhs were also considered alien
 durbhaagya se, unke liye yah anhoni sabit hua or vahi unki dukhad maut kaa kaaran bana
 But the contradictions remained
 rajeev gandhi ko loksabhaa chunaav main aitihaasik janadesh mila
 The Congress has forgotten that its anti-sikh strategy proved effective
 uske baad rajeev gandhi ati virodhabhasi ranneeti par aage bade, jo uske pehle desh kii raajnneeti main nahin dekhi gai thi
 He first tried to appease the Muslim by banning the Shahbano case and the book of Salman Rushdie
 phir, ve duusari disha main chal pade or hindu vot bank ke liye apni ayodhya muhim shuru kii
 This two-pronged strategy was to no avail
 rajeev gandhi kaa dukhad ant ho gaya
 But the communal political agenda continued
 aisa lagata he ki tatkaaleen grih mantri, pradhanmantri, vipaksh ke netaa tathaa baad main pradhanmantri bane atal bihari vaajapeyi sabko aage hone vaale (babari masjid) vidhwans kii jaankaree thi
 All had given such statements before the incident in which there were apprehensions
 dilachasp yah bhi he ki us traasad ghatana ke baad jo exiar darj kii gai, usamen bijepi kaa naam nahin tha, ajeeb taur par police ne vidhwans kaa aarope balasaheb thakare par lagaaya
 The new millennium Sahasradabradi opened in the new millennium began with the ominous incident of the 9 / 11 attack in New York
 bharat main bhi aatankwaad virodh muhim shuru hui
 For a few years, the biggest issue for Muslims became illegal confinement and arbitrary arrests under black law like TADA
 satta hasil karne ke liye avaanchit logon ke khilaaf farji muthbhed or gaiyr-kanoonee kaid ko aujaar kii tarah istemaal kiya jane laga
 The number of Muslim prisoners in jails has become proportionately higher

 According to the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO), the average per capita expenditure of a Sikh family every month in 2009-10 is Rs 1,659
 tha jabaki musalmaan parivaar main 980 ru
 Was
 hindu or isai pariwaron ke maamle main yah aankada kramshah 1,125 ru
 And Rs 1,543
 tha
 The NSSO figures also show that urban Indian (average per capita spending per month is Rs 1,773)
 ) graminon (prati maah ausat prati vyakti kharch 901 ru
 ) Were nearly twice as rich
 lekin desh ke gramin ilaakon main bhi musalmaan sampatti or kharch kii kshamta ke maamle main sabase nichle paaydaan par the
 Sikhs had the highest spending capacity, while Hindus and Christians were in the middle
 sikh or hinduon ke mukaable musalamaanon kii ucch shiksha paane kii sambhaavna bhi kaaphi kam he
 The NSSO report states that urban Muslim boys and girls have the highest drop out rate
 ucch shiksha main yah fark kaaphi bad jaataa he
 Out of every 1,000 Hindu boys, 30 reach MA (postgraduate) while in the case of Hindu girls this ratio is 32
 lekin har 1,000 muslim ladakon main sirf 10 hi eme tak pahunch pate hai jabaki muslim ladakiyon ke maamle main yah aankada mahaj 2 kaa he
 In rural areas, they do not get work under the government's National Employment Guarantee Scheme
 1999 se 2011 ke bich musalamaanon kii prati vyakti aamadani main maamuli fark hi aayaa
 It is also half as compared to scheduled castes and tribes and backward castes
 jin kshetron main pragati or vruddhi se musalamaanon ko sabase zyada laabh mil saktaa tha, unamem us paimaane par teji nahin ai jaise takanic, dawa or duusare kshetron main baari vruddhi dikhi he
 For example, exports of handicraft items amounted to Rs 17,000 crore in 2015-16

 It dropped from 4 per cent in 2001-02 to a little under 1 per cent in 2011-12
 desh kaa hastkala udyog bikharaa-bikharaa he
 There are more than 7 million handicraftsmen in different regions of the country and there are more than 67,000 exporters / export houses who deliver their goods to the markets of India and abroad
 sachhar cameti kii report ke baad musalamaanon kii haalat ke akalan ke liye pro

 The most worrying is that according to the NSSO, between 2004-05 and 2011-12, the per capita spending capacity of Muslims increased by 60 per cent whereas it was 69 per cent among Hindu tribals, 73 per cent among Hindu Dalits, 89 per cent among Hindu backwardes and "upper caste Hindus" rose 122 percent
 yah fark khaskar shahari ilaakon main badhata ja rahaa he, jahaan garibi rekha ke neeche rahane waalon main muslim pichhadon kaa anupaat hindu daliton se badhata ja rahaa he
 The Constitution of reservation says that reservation will be given only to socially and economically backward classes, but the Mandal Commission recommendations were based on caste
 badi sankhya main hindu jatiyon ko iske daayre main laayaa gaya jabaki gaiyr-hindu alpsankhyak isse baahar rakhe gaye
 The method of inclusion of castes in this list has been very complicated and opaque
 iske paimaane kabhi saaf nahin ho paae
 This is also evident from the guidelines laid down in the Indira Sawhney case
 kai kanoonee visheshgyon ne daleel di ki ab vakt aa gaya he ki is paimaane kii samiksha kii jaae or samaaj ke sabase vanchit tabakon ko aarakshan ke daayre main laayaa jaae
 Being left out of the reservation policy, the Muslims were left behind
 eneseso ke aankade bhi gavaahi dete hai ki haalanki hindu pichde 1999 main ausat logon se maamuli neeche the, ab unki sthiti takreeban oonchi jatiyon ke baraabar ho gai he
 But the Muslims who are equal to the backward are left far behind
 unki haalat chalis saal pehle ausat darje kii thi lekin ve sabase, yahaan tak ki essi-asti se bhi, neeche pahunch gaye hai
 Vice President Hamid Ansari also said in September 2015, "there is a need to amend the categories for government policies in the country that exclude Muslims (scheduled Caste status) or to some extent (in the list of obcs)
" has been done
 uplabdh aankadon se jaahir hota he ki musalamaanon kii badi sankhya in do badi shreniyon main aati he
 "constitutional Rights of Minorities These days there is a debate on the constitutionality of government programs in which beneficiaries are selected on the basis of religion
 kuch logon kii daleel he ki yah dharm ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav baratane jaisaa he
 But a close study shows that the Indian Constitution does not forbid the selection of beneficiaries on the basis of religion
 asal main samvidhan main dharm kaa zikr nasl, jati, ling or janmasthan kii tarah hi kiya gaya he
 Caste, gender and birthplace are used liberally in the selection of beneficiaries of government policies
 bharat main saamaajik samoohon kii vividhta or ekarupata ke maddenjar yah jaruri he ki samaan avasar ko badhaava dene vaale sarkari kaaryakramon ke labhaarthiyon ke chayan ke liye dharm samet vibhinn shreniyan banaai jaaen
 The Constitution of India talks about providing equal status and opportunity to all citizens and directs the government to take proactive steps to provide equal opportunities
 samta, samaan adhikaar or samaan avasar kii avadharana kaa anuchhed 14 (samanta kaa adhikaar), anuchhed 15 (shiksha kaa adhikaar) or anuchhed 16 (rojgaar kaa adhikaar) kaa vistaar se zikr he
 Article 16 talks about equal opportunities in government jobs and it is forbidden to discriminate on the basis of religion, race, caste, etc
 isaki dhara-4 main sarkari niyuktiyon main aise ''pichde varg" ko aarakshan dene kaa praavdhaan he jiskaa sarkari sevaaon main paryaapt pratinidhitiv na ho
 The state is responsible for determining which group and class is "backward"
 shaharikaran se kya fark?musalmaan shuru se hi gaanvon se adhik shaharon main rahe hai
 Their urban population 17 in 2001
 3 fisadi or gramin aabaadi 12
 Was 5 percent
 isi tarah 2011 main shaharon main 35 fisadi musalmaan rahete the to gaanvon main 28
 6 per cent
 saath hi, kul muslim aabaadi kaa 10 fisadi 50 lakh se adhik aabaadi vaale mahanagaron main rahata he
 Overall urban population of India 23 in 1981
 7 fisadi se 2011 main 31 fisadi tak badi
 During this period, the Muslim population in urban areas increased from 34 percent to 39 percent
 iskaa matlab yah he ki aam aabaadi kaa shaharikaran 7
 If 5 per cent, urbanization of Muslims is only 5 per cent
 ise kaise samaj sakate hai? krishi sankat ne badi sankhya main aam aabaadi ko gaanvon se shaharon kii ore thela he lekin musalamaanon ke pravaas ko iske jariye nahin samajha ja saktaa
 The reason is that Muslims are not farm owners except for a few districts
 gaanvon main gaiyr-krishi rojgaar main musalamaanon kii hissedari kaaphi adhik he
 So, it is more likely that due to the poor economy of the rural economy, Muslim families may have gone to urban centers in large numbers
 haalanki aisa hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 Statistics show that our cities no longer welcome minorities
 2004 or 2011 kii avadhi main shaharon main dalit aabaadi main 1
 4 per cent increase while Muslims 2
 2 fisadi bade or oonchi jati ke hindu 3
 Grew 8 percent
 chote shaharon main yah rujhaan or saaf dikhaa
 In the third and fourth grade cities, the Muslim population in the last decade is just 0
 2 fisadi badi he jabaki kul badhotaree isse takreeban das guna zyada he
 Another change in the country, especially in the last three decades, is the increase in rural-urban settlements
 ye basaawatein kisi bade shahar ke chaaron ore badi bastiyaan hai, jo na shahar hai, na gaanv
 These settlements are settled on lands which once used to be fields but are no longer cultivable
 bade shaharon ke kareeb hone se aisi jameenon kii keemten kai guna bad gai hai
 Those who have sold their land have cash but they do not have the skills to put that capital into any productive work
 shaharon main sabase saaf dikhne vaala rojgaar ke taur-tareekon main badlaav he
 There we see a huge decline in self-employment
 musalamaanon ke maamle main yah giravat baaki samoohon se adhik tikhi dikhti he
 There has been an increase in regular employment but it shows a dangerous trend
 musalamaanon ke liye niyamit rojgaron main gramin ilaakon main teji se vruddhi hui he, lekin shahari ilaakon main vah baaki samoohon se kaaphi peeche he
 However, in the case of Muslims in large cities, there has been a rapid increase in temporary employment
 shaharikaran ab garibon ke liye kaaphi mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 The rents are quite expensive, dense settlements are increasing immensely and life is becoming increasingly unsafe due to poor law and order
 duusari samasya beshak yah he ki shahari rojgaar ab hunarmand logon kii maang karata he
 Migrant laborers from marginalized communities such as Dalits, Adivasis and Muslims, usually do not know any skill or specialize in outdated skills
 isliye ve hamaare shaharon ke pratikul maahaul main or alag-thalag mahasoos karte hai
 So, is there no future? In the last thirty years, the lives of the people have improved and the wave of GDP growth has brought some greenery in the lives of the minorities of India
 lekin daliton or musalamaanon ke madadgaar bane chamada or maance niryaat jaise kshetra desh main paabandiyon kii nai samskruti ke shikaar ho rahe hai
 However, with the improvement in primary education, the emergence of a strong private sector and the preparation of a middle class, the situation for minorities has improved somewhat
 desh main digital kranti, bijli kii aapurti main sudhaar or yatayaat aasaan hone se sthitiyaan bhi teji se sudharengi or vanchiton ko laabh ho saktaa he
 In our democracy, the rule of law prevails, so a large minority group is set to gain political hegemony, especially at the local level
 bharat bhale philhal thode samay ke liye ativaadee, antarmukhi soch ke dakshinpanthi daur se guzar rahaa he lekin iske baad musalamaanon ke liye bhi ''achche din" aane vaale hai

 ) congress mahasachiv or purvi uttar pradesh kii prabharee priyanka gandhi varanasi se pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav lard sakati hai
 According to information from sources, Priyanka herself has agreed to contest elections but the final decision in this regard is to be taken by the Congress President and her brother Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka's mother Sonia Gandhi
 party main mahasachiv banane ke baad priyanka kaaphi sakriy hai or lagaataar party ke liye upi ke vibhinn ilaakon main prachaar kar rahi hai
 Recently, he had also asked Varanasi to contest against Modi on the question of a supporter
 sapa, basapa or ralod ne mahagathbandhan karke congress ke liye upi main sirf do siten chhodin to aakhir congress ne apana wo patta chal diya jisko wo apana turup kaa ikkaa bataati rahi
 That is, Priyanka Gandhi became a formal entry in the politics of Vadra
 purvi upi kii prabharee mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ne apane pehle daure kii shuruyaat prayag se banaras tak boat yatra ke jariye kii
 Baba Kashi Vishwanath's temple was also visited in Sankarabarnas from the road show, met the families of the martyrs and did the road show
 iske baad kayaas lage ki kya priyanka loksabhaa chunaav ladengi? sutron kii maane to priyanka khud sidhe pradhanmantri modi ke khilaaf banaras se chunaav ladane par gambhirtha se vichaar kar rahi hai
 Sources close to Priyanka told Aaj Tak that AAP, SP, BSP and Congress had contested in front of Modi in the last election
 2014 main modi ke paksh main hawa thi, narendra modi apane nikatatam pratidwandvi aam aadmi party ke arvind kejariwal se 3,71,784 voton ke antar se jite
 Narendra Modi received a total of 5,81,022 votes
 vahiin, duusare sthaan par arvind kejariwal ko 2,09,238 mat mili
 Congress candidate Ajay Rai finished third with 75,614 votes
 varanasi loksabhaa main bahujan samaaj party ke pratyaashee vijay prakaash jaiswal chauthe sthaan par rahe
 He got 60,579 votes
 uttar pradesh kii sattarudh samaajawaadee party ke pratyaashee kailash chaurasia 45,291 maton ke saath paanchaven sthaan par rahe
 It is no longer close to Modi Leharpriyanka says that if Modi united his vote of opposition, then the difference of Modi's victory in 2014 would have reduced considerably and now there is no Modi wave
 isliye agar priyanka jaisaa majboot cheharaa banaam modi chunaav hota he to banaras fatah ho saktaa he
 But for this, SP and BSP will also have to come in favor of Priyanka, which is quite possible
 khud priyanka bhi isko lekar gambhir hai, isiilie jab band kamare main raibareli ke kaaryakartaaon ne kisi bhi seat se chunaav ladane kii maang kii to priyanka ne muskuraate hue kaha ki, banaras se lard jaaun kya?modi ke khilaaf ladane ko taiyaaraiske baad jab ajtak ne priyanka gandhi se banaras se ladane par sawaal kiya to wo tapaak se boleen ki, main taiyaar hum, party faisla karegi, jo party kahegi wo karuungi
 Overall, even today, Priyanka's close friend said about Priyanka's fight with Benaras, that Priyanka and the party are seriously considering the matter
 vaise to shuruyaat se hi priyanka chunaav ladane ke bajaay upi main party ko majboot karne ke mood main raheen, lekin badi chunauti ke maddenjar wo banaras se ladane ko taiyaar hai
 However, before the final verdict, she is also holding the stance of other opposition parties and final discussions with big leaders including Rahul Sonia
 yani agar aakhir main priyanka ne banaras se ummidavaari jataa di to 2019 main puraa desh banaras main ek aisa chunaav dekhegaa, jiskaa nateeja kuch bhi ho lekin itihaas main hameshaa yaad kiya jayega

 Rahul had promised to revive the Congress in Bihar, but his interest in the state ended after the party was wiped out in the 2010 assembly elections

 This was his worst performance in Bihar's electoral history
 rahul july, 2011 main aakhri baar bihar gaye the or unki berukhi ne party ko anaath kar diya
 The decision to contest the elections alone was rejected by all coalitions in Bihar because they knew that the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) or the Lok Janshakti Party all grew up at the expense of the Congress
 ek varisht netaa ne india today ko bataaya ki kai bade netaa loksabhaa main apni jeet kii khatir argedy ke saath janaa chaahate hai
 Today, if Rahul seems ready to go with the RJD, then the only reason is that the Congress leaders have made him understand that without Lalu's support, he will not cross his eyes

 In Bihar, Nitish Kumar has now got divorced in Janata dal-united (JD-U) and BJP

 If the old loyalists are turning to the BJP, how will the Congress' desire to stop the bjp's move towards power come true? party ne hameshaa khandaan kaa saath diya he or uskaa phayda uthaaya he

 The Rashtriya Lok Samata Party contested the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar along with the BJP and won three seats
 party ke adhyaksh upendra kushvaha ne kaha ki nitish kumaar ne bihar main lalu prasad ke netritv ke dauraan ‘‘jangal raaj’’ kaa muqabla karne ke liye ek samay samta party kaa gathan kiya tha or ab waapas unke saath ho gayi hai
 Nitish Kumar resigned from the post of Chief Minister taking moral responsibility for his party's defeat in Bihar in the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections and a new government formed under the leadership of Jitan Ram Manjhi in the state has been given unconditional support by Lalu

 Gujarat's role will be very important for Narendra Modi's return to power in 2019 as last time BJP did a clean sweep from here, the party understands this situation very well, so the party has already started planning and organizing there
 Speaker Amit Shah is going to participate in the Chintan camp in which many important topics will be discussed about the Lok Sabha elections

 Preparation on electoral strategy: Gujarat BJP has set for itself the target of 26 out of 26 Lok Sabha seats in the next general election to be held in 2019
 puure 26 siten kis tarah hasil kii jaae uske liye bhi is shivi main chintan hoga
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had got 15 seats in Gujarat, while in the 2014 elections, the BJP had won 26 seats in the entire 26 seats
 party apana pichhlaa pradarshan is baar bhi doharaana chaahati he, haalanki is baar bijepi ke liye raah aasaan nahin dikh rahi kyonki kam se kam 10 siten aisi hai jahaan par party ko seat bachaane ke liye khaasaa sangharsh karnaa pad saktaa he, vahaan par satta virdohi lahar ke alaava kai anya kaarnon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 It is believed that in the seats where the Gujarat BJP is facing a crisis of defeat, it can bet on changing its candidate
 chintan shivi main party ummidavaar badalane ko charchaa karegi
 Advani's ticket will be cut! With regard to the Lok Sabha elections, BJP is making bridges between the reality and Lakshyank

 Similarly, actor-turned-politician Paresh Rawal who no longer wants to contest the elections himself, the BJP will have to put up a strong Dalit leader in front of Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani in Gujarat

 On the other hand, Patidar caste dominated the Patidar-dominated areas in Saurashtra in the last year's assembly elections

 In the presence of Amit Shah in the Chintan camp, further strategy and possible candidate will also be discussed in these seats through micro level planning
