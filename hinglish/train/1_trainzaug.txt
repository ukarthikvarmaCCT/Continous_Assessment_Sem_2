joshi sar jaanate the yah
 In those days too, there was a lot of writing and reading
 is vajah se kabhi-kabhi padhai bhi peeche chhootane lagati
 Even in Joshi sir's class, sometimes he was a bit lost
 is par ve akasar mithi-si chutki lete
 But he has never been discouraged from reading or writing literature in the name of career
 kabhi-kabhi musakarakar yah bhi kehete ki "dekho bhai, hameshaa jo li chhodkar chalate hai, ve hi jindagi main kuch kar pate hai
 But yes Paresh, one thing must be kept in mind
 li chhodkar usee ko chalanaa chahie jisamen nai li banane kaa hausala or uske liye badi se badi takaliphen jhelane kaa madda ho
 "it was probably the result of Joshi sir's blessings that he stumbled a lot in life, but never lost
 yahan tak ki jaan-boojhkar vipattiyaan bulaata rahaa, aa bail mujhe maar! dost kehete, "pagalaa gaya he paresh, pataa nahin kis nashe main rahata he! bhala aise bhi jindagi ko koi daanv par lagaataa he?" par yakeen tha ki main joshi sar kaa shishy hoon, koi meraa kuch nahin bigaad saktaa
 No matter how much misery or troubles come, i will not give up
 or yahi cheez hameshaa badi se badi mushkilon se bachaa leti thi
 That is, the one who believed in his Guru Prannath Joshi, later became the foundation of faith in himself
 2haalaanki yah bhi sach he ki jab ham unase padhate the, nawein-dasven darje main- tab itnaa dar lagata tha unase ki akasar hawa kharaab ho jaati
 He never hit - never touched his hand, but torture was nothing to us more than his anger
 yah digar baat he ki is sabake baavjood sabase zyada pyaar bhi ham unheen se karte the
 Thus, there was one to one good teacher in Adarsh vidyabhavan, the best school in our town, but we were only murdered by Joshi sir
 shaayad isliye ki or adhyaaapak sirf padhaate the
 And used to teach well
 par joshi sar main padhaane kaa jaise junun-sa tha
 His teaching started from the text books and soon reached the open book of life
 or yah aisi jagah thi jahaan guide karnaa to chhodie, kuch bhi bataane, sunne yaa samvaad karne laayak us vakt hamaare kasbe main koi na tha
 One interesting thing is that they would keep the entire class alert like they used to
 majaal he ki jab ve class main hon or padhaa rahe hon, kisi ko jamuhai aa jaae
 Suddenly, the style of asking the question by turning the neck behind while teaching Joshi sir was so sweet that all of us would suddenly run a lightning and start competing very well to answer
 isliye ki ve sirf sawaal poochhate hi nahin the, balki koun kis andaaj main jawaab detaa he, is par bhi unki paini najar rahati thi
 If something went wrong, it would have been fun to interrupt immediately and in front of the whole class
 or jawaab badhiya hota to itani tarif karte ki lagata, oh, hamaara is duniya main janm lenaa or adarsh vidyabhavan main aakar joshi sar se padhanaa dhanya ho gaya
 It is as if we come to the school that if Joshi asks Sir, we can quickly answer his question
 man baag-baag ho jaataa! ahaa, joshi sar ne tarif kar di, to ab jindagi main bhala paane ko rah hi kya gaya?or ve koi ek-do se poochkar santusht ho jane waalon main se nahin the
 One by one, every student would stand up and sometimes they would make the whole class stand up
 aakhir main main or subodh hi rah jate or ham bijli ke-se chaukannepan se joshi sar kii ore takataki lagaae dakhte ki kab ve puuchhen or ham bataaen
 And by the time the number arrives, the heartbeat would have increased so much that it seems that just now, we will faint and fall to the ground
 kai baar to main or subodh ghar se hi itani taiyaari karke jate ki jaise kisi antarrarashtriya seminar main janaa ho
 Being Joshi himself, he would have put a series of questions to himself
 baar-baar bheetar se sawaal footataa- ki acha bataao, agar joshi sar ne yah poocha, to bhala kya jawaab doge? hamaare subject to puure aath the, par sachhee baat to yah he ki subject hamaare liye ek hi tha- angreji
 The rest of the subjects were read, that's all
 par angreji? isamen to ham lot lagaate the, isliye ki yah joshi sar kaa subject jo tha
 Such a strict competition
 
 
 ki akasar vahi hamaare liye puure din kii safalataa kaa mayaar ban jaataa!subodh mujh jaise ati bhavuk or chuppa shaks kii tulana main kaaphi vity tha or kabhi-kabhi majaak main kaha karata tha, "yaar paresh, kahin hamen joshi sar se ishk to nahin ho gaya? aaj subah hi main soch rahaa tha ki pataa nahin, yah kya chakkar he ki class to or bhi hai, par ham shaayad sirf joshi sar ke period ke liye skool aate hai
 You do not think so Paresh
 
 
 ?""haan, baat to sahi he
 "I used to laugh so much, so much that i smiled like a burst of laughter burst from within
 subodh ne bilkul thik kaha tha
 We were really crazy
 joshi sar hamase khush hai, yahi hamaare khush hone or jeene kaa sabase bada kaaran tha
 We would be willing to die for their happiness! If you do not call it crazy, what to say? Such Joshi sir will also go, and this world will be without him, never thought
 
 
 
 And even today those days are hovering in my eyes like kites, when me and Subodh used to go to their house to study
 bachche kii tarah unke paas baithkar siikhnaa kya kabhi bhuulaa ja saktaa he? haalaanki jab ham log naukariyon par lag gaye, to milane ke liye unke yahan jane par kabhi-kabhi thode tanj ke saath bhi ve kehete, "bhai, ab main kya kahoon? ab to tum log kaaphi sikh gaye ho
 You will think that this old man is doing painfully and we have to listen in due course
 vaise bhi ab mere paas kya he tumhen bataane ko? ulataa kya kuch aaj kii duniya main ho rahaa he, yah tumhiin sikhaaoge
 Then pointing at me and saying, Paresh, you have a very big name, be a writer-journalist
 suna he, khub naam ho gaya he tumhaara
 Not much, but i read and read a few magazines in between, then i am very proud that my student has reached so far
 "sunakar main pani-pani ho jaataa
 Silently, he would say, "sir, if i do more khichdi, i will get up and leave
" "is par joshi sar musakaraane lagate
 Although last time a similar incident took place and i became very much apprehensive, then Joshi sir went ahead and held me with love
 meri ankhen us samay geeli thim
 3 Prannath Joshi
 
 
 ! ye hamaare liye keval shabd nahin, sachmuch praanon se badhkar koi cheez the
 Deep emotion and warm words in the heart
 isiilie ‘hamaare angreji ke adhyaaapak prannath joshi’- sirf itnaa kehane se baat nahin banati
 To be honest, they were something else
 sabase alag or itane bade
 
 
 That it was almost impossible to touch them
 hamaare bade se bade adarsh se bhi ve bade the
 Yes, they were teachers
 magar aise adhyaaapak jisaki ek adarsh or kalpit tasaveer hameshaa hamaare dil main rahati he
 Perhaps that's why i would like to say about him in one sentence, Prannath Joshi could have been only one Prannath Joshi in the whole world! It may not be possible to create another person like him, even for God himself
 bahut-si baaten ham kabhi na samaj pate, agar joshi sar kii class main na gaye hote
 For example, what is teaching? Ask me or Subodh, we will say that teaching is what we used to feel in Joshi sir's class when he was teaching
 padhaate the to bilkul dub jate the
 And he used to teach in such a dramatic way that his magic used to be appreciated on the whole class
 kai baar class main unki mudraayen dekh-dekhakar ham maano hakke-bakke-se rah jate the
 Perfectly written
 unka padhaayaa hua paath ‘ankal poger hangs a pikchar’ ab bhi yaad he
 And why am i still saying? Because it is not enough for me to forget it even for life
 uf, unhone kis kadar puri class main naach-naachakar yah paath padhaayaa ki kis tarah ankal poger tasaveer taangne ke liye ek stool par chadhate hai or phir kya-kya tamaashe hote hai
 In this way, he put a nail on the wall, drove such a hammer so that the plaster of the wall fell away, and then Uncle Pauser fell with it
 
 
 m! naatak main naatak main naatak
 
 
 Taoba-taoba! The specialty of this play of Joshi sir is that he only took a lot of voice and he used to have a lot of discrepancies and scenes were created from scene to scene
 us sabaki yaad se main aaj bhi chakit or visfaarit rah jaataa hoon ki kya sachmuch yah hua tha! or vah bhi adarsh vidyabhavan ke padhaaku magar kinchit dakiyanoos vaataavaran main- ki ek naatakeey paath ko uske asal or puure naatak ke saath yon padhaayaa gaya ki maano aap class rup main nahin, mandi house main baithe hai!or yahi nahin, har roj jab ve padhaa rahe hote to apane desh, samaaj or kabhi-kabhi to adarsh vidyabhavan ke bare main bhi unki tikhi aalochanaayen or katuktiyaan tak sunne ko mil jaati thim
 In exactly the same way as you are watching a sarcastic satirical drama at mandihouse, with a dose of horrific absurdity from beginning to end
 
 
 !joshi sar kii ek khaasiyat yah thi ki ve bade nafis kism ke aadmi the
 The white immaculate dhoti-kurta was always seen in the wood
 jameen se jaise aadha foot upar hon
 And he was a critic of almost everything
 khud hamaare skool ke rang-dhang kii aalochana ve jis dhakdi se karte the, usase ham chakit hone ke saath-saath kuch aatankit or ashankit bhi hote the ki ye sari baaten adarsh vidyabhavan ke maha shaktishaalee principal da
 If Balwantdev reaches Makhija, do not know what will be wrong! But while talking to Joshi sir, there was no need to look right-left
 joshi sar se judaa ek prasang or he jise main aaj tak nahin bhul paaya or shaayad is jindagi main to kabhi nahin bhul paaoonga
 It happened once that he taught grammar lessons in class and gave any of the same work to all the children, to bring it from home
 unka kaam ham bachche sabase pehle karte the, isliye ki unke gusse or isse bhi adhik unke bhaashanon se bada dar lagata tha
 To be honest, sometimes they used to make us giant
 
 
 vishalakaar daitya! to unhen kaise bhulaayaa ja saktaa tha? lekin is dfa hua yah ki unhone homework diya, phir lambii chhuttiyaan ho gayi
 So no one remembers the class
 chhuttiyon ke baad ham class main aae to joshi ji ne kaam ke bare main poocha
 No one had done homework except ace in the entire class, so their anger reached the seventh sky and they ordered the whole class to become 'cock'
 sabhi sann! sabhi jaanate the ki joshi ji kaa kaha pathar kii lakeer he
 There is no choice without considering it
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki ankhane par ve gusse main sajaa or badha den
 So one by one, all the children came forward and became cock
 rah gaya main jo joshi ji kaa bahut sammaan karata tha, par murga bananaa mujhe bura lagata tha
 i used to think that when God has made a good man, i have no right to make a cock - not even to Joshi sir, no matter how reverend they may be
 alabatta main murga nahin bana
 He did not make up even after saying it again and again
 joshi sar ne bahut dhamkaaya
 Asked to leave class immediately and not to attend class for a week
 main is par bhi taiyaar nahin tha
 The only response i had to his threats and angry words was, "sir, you kill me
" aap kitna hi maariye, main bilkul chun nahin karunga
 But i will not be a cock
 "ek period puraa nikal gaya isi chakkarbaji main
 Joshi sir used to calm down and explain to me that "look Paresh, you have to be cock
 iske bagaiyr koi chaara nahin he
 Rather, my punishment may increase further
 isliye acha he ki pehle hi maan lo
 "I used to scold in a fit of anger
 ant main period khatm hone kii ghanti baji, to mujhe kuch chaiyn padaa
 When Joshi started going from class, he said in a decisive voice, "look Paresh, because of you, the entire period of so many students was spoiled
 puri class kaa bahut nuksaan tumne karaayaa he
 Now in the next period, either do not come to my class, or come here and become a rooster as soon as the period starts
 acchhee tarah soch lo ki tumhen kya karnaa he, varanaa mujhe sakht kadam uthaanaa padegaa
 You are the best student of the class and you know yourself, how much i love you
 par disiplin ij disiplin
 Here i can not compromise
 aaj tumhen chhodoonga, to kal ko class ke duusare bachche bhi yahi kahenge
 So you deside, want to sit in my class or not? ”I was shocked with my head
 main to soch rahaa tha ki period khatm hua to is bhalaa se chhutkaaraa mil gaya
 That is why i had been praying to God for so long that "O Lord, make the hour be played at the earliest, so that i can avoid this disaster
" "or ab ghanta baja bhi to yah afat!
 
 
 Oops, killed Gulfam! The children of the class who had just got rid of this calamity by becoming cock one or half minute in the beginning, were looking at me with such kindness as to go for a halal You are going alabatta class main jo do-teen ladkiyaan thim or jinhen is sajaa se swaabhaavik rup se mukti mili hui thi, kaaphi prashansa bhari najaron se meri ore dekh rahi thim
 And this really increased my spirits
 khaskar saanwali salotaree devaki, jo teenon ladakiyon main sabase hoshiyaar thi- kaa dekhnaa to kuch alag-sa hi tha
 i felt that those eyes were telling me, "stay tight Paresh, stay strong
" tum sahi ho, ekadam sahi
 So don't give up at all, i swear to you! "after that several periods came, one by one
 mujhe kuch hosh nahin tha
 As if i have been spiked! All my attention was on the time of the murder which was going to come in the next period of English i
e
 the eighth period
 kya koi aisa tarika ho saktaa tha jo mujhe aane vaali badi afat se bachaa le? par nahin, afat jo aane vaali he, vah to aakar hi rahati he
 Who has been able to stop him? There was no way to avoid him, except to prove myself right after hitting Joshi's head
 par kya joshi sar se main bhid saktaa tha? mere pair kaanp rahe the, jabaki andar se man kah rahaa tha, “tum sahi ho paresh, tum ekadam sahi ho
 Why do you need to be a cock? "I added to this tone, i said to myself," If you want to punish Joshi sir, then scold me, or whatever you kill, but the cock
 
 
 ? nahin-nahin, yah to galat he, behuda he, anyaay
 
 
 ! And injustice is injustice, even if it is our respected Joshi sir who does it! ”courage on the one hand, on the other hand
 vikat pasti main thar-thar kaanpati taangen
 It was amazing ghabrahat ke maare pasinaa chhot niklaa tha
 The tongue clung to the palate and the lips were dry
 hai, ab kya hone vaala he?
 
 
 Paresh, what will happen next? Thus, the eighth period started after ram-ram
 meri upar kii saans upar, neeche kii neeche
 Pran was dying for fear that he did not know what happened! Joshi sir asked his same ruthless neutrality when he came to class, "yes Paresh, what did you think
 
 
 ?"main jawaab dena chahta tha, par hont to jaise papadiya chuke the! balki joshi sar kii subah vaali class main bolte hue swar main jo hath or majbootee thi, vah ab nahin rah gai thi
 i saw a dead voice come out of my mouth, "sir, you kill me as much as you want, but
 
 ? "but what
 
 
 ? tum saaf-saaf bataao ki murga banoge ki nahin? main kuch or nahin sunanaa chahta
 "joshi sir suddenly said in anger
 meri phir hawa gol hone lagi, par maine jaise-taise himmat banaae rakhi
 "sir, i will not be a cock, but kill you
 " kehete hue maine haath aage kar die
 The whole class was watching this drama, which was now reached at the climax
 "dekho, tum meraa hi nahin, class ke saare bacchon kaa time barbaad kar rahe ho paresh
 Even if the whole year goes out like this, but
 
 
 sajaa to tumhen milegi or tumhen murga bananaa padegaa
 Otherwise i will not teach
 socho, kitna nuksaan puure class kaa hoga tumhaari vajah se
 "sir, you kill
 " meri vahi tech
 i again put my hands forward
 meraa haath thar-thar kaanp rahaa tha
 Really, even if there were twenty poles after each, i would not have felt it
 par bhala murga kaise banun main, jabaki man nahin he murga banane kaa? or phir us saanwali si devaki ne jis himmat or saraahna bhari najaron se meri ore dekha tha, use kya main samajhataa nahin tha? naveen main tha, par samajhataa tha ki jab koi ladki is tarah kisi kii ore dekhe, to sab kuch bhul, jaan par khel janaa chahie
 On
 
 
 ?to yon murga main na bana
 Joshi sir showed great fear, his condition was also bad due to anger
 itani der se ve lagaataar bolte ja rahe the kabhi gusse main, kabhi pyaar se
 Psychological fear in between
 
 
 
 He had gone all three of his quiver
 par kya karte! ve mujhe pyaar bhi bahut karte the
 So they found a middle ground
 bole, "acha, itnaa hi tum kehete ho to bas, ek tarika he
 
 
 
 agar class ke bachche kahenge ki paresh ko chhod dijie, to main chhod doongaa
 "oh, thank God a million!" o God, how kind you are, how much
 
 
 kitna mamatvapurn!" unki baat abhi puri bhi na thi, ki puri class ek saath cheekh padi, "chhod dijie sar, chhod dijie
 
 
 Leave! ”and thus the pending victory and defeat in the court was not only a matter of dying and living, but barely ended
 haalaanki ab bhi antartam main buree tarah ‘thar-thar
 
 
 It was moving
 ankhen jaise aansuon se umad uthanaa chaahati hon or ansu nikal bhi na rahe hon! badi vicitra haalat
 ∙∙ Well, that day i got out of school on full leave, then i had become the 'hero' of all the children of the class, because a child, like a nachiketa for the first time, with his humility, like Joshi sir with a strong and strict mood
 The teacher was victorious
 
 
 or kahie ki ek sahi mudde par vijay pai thi
 This victory was over that dear teacher whom we wanted to live with, and whose anger we felt no less terrible than Yamraj! 4 However, Joshi sir did not always remain the same
 or jab teen saal baad meraa chota bhai attu unki class main pahunchaa, unka mizaaj kaaphi badal gaya tha
 They were beginning to look more tender and affectionate
 chaatro ko sajaa dene vaali sakhti bhi kam hoti gai
 However, she was eager to give all of her lessons while teaching the disciples and she stayed in them till the end! Probably because no student had a roll number empty for them! He knew everyone from inside and outside and tried not only to teach but also to groom his personality as much as possible
 or mere prati mamtalu kism kaa unka pyaar to shuru se hi tha
 It was my first day in his class, when he answered my question in good English, his eyes were stuck on my face
 kuch chaukakar unhone poocha, "paresh, kya tum anglo indian ho?""nahin sar
 "I said shocked
 "par tumhen angreji aati he
 "looking at such loving eyes, he said that i have not forgotten him till today
 or phir unke kuch aise hi saraahna bhare shabd darjanon baar sunne ko mili
 He used to praise but not just say a few words, but his whole personality sparked a different kind of happiness which i did not see anywhere other than him
 or kabhi chukta to puri class ke aage pani utaar dete, "are, kya ho gaya paresh tumhen? tum bhi jawaab nahin de paae itane maamuli sawaal kaa, yah to badi shame kii baat he
 "I used to listen, as if the earth bursts and i can fit into it! In fact, this was their way of getting into someone's heart
" ve jaise aapaki har cheez se cancerd the, isiilie unhen or unki kahi hui baton ko bhula paanaa asambhav hota
 Atu was telling, "on the very first day after going to Joshi sir's class, he came to know that i am your brother
 or jaise hi maine bataaya ki sar, main paresh kaa chota bhai hoon, unki aankhon main pyaar ke badal umad pade
 His face was so full of affection that he could not speak for a minute
 phir bahut bhavuk hokar poocha- acha, kaisaa he paresh
 
 
 The Is it ok! Ever remembers me or not? Tell him, never come to see me
 kya vah mujhe bhul gaya he?
 
 
 And then do not know how long they kept telling the whole class that Paresh was such a brilliant and loving student whom they will never forget
 "usee din se attu class main unka sabase zyada snehabhajan ban gaya
 They used to take care of every single thing about him
 agar galati bhi karata, to pyaar se samajhaate
 Sometimes he used to scold me that "work hard, Amit
" tum paresh ke bhai ho, yah pataa to chalanaa chahie
 
 
 
 haan, agar koi mushkil aae to ek nahin, das baar pucho
 But don't do that i have to scold you
 kahin paresh kaa naam mat dubo dena
 Mind It, my favorite student was that
 "hamaare skool ke bahut-se teacher the jo padhaate to the, par jinhen padhaanaa afat lagati thi
 Therefore, before the period was over, he used to sit in the register keeping track of the hour when he started the routine of the next class
 par joshi sar ke liye padhaanaa jaise nasha tha
 He really enjoyed it and i think, even if he was taught to teach for twenty-four hours continuously, he would not get tired
 class main bhi akasar aisa hota ki ghanta baj gaya, par joshi sar naatakeey dhang se kisi kavita-kahani kii vyakhya yaa phir kisi kairactor kii kisi khaas adaa ko bataane main itane tallin ki pataa hi nahin
 Then we had to be reminded that the period is over, sir and they would interrupt their thought flow by saying 'sorry' and perhaps reluctantly leave class
 yahan tak ki imtihaanon ke najadik aa jane par to ve hamen itvaar ko ghar bulaane lage, taaki grammer ke jaruri nots likhva saken
 And all his old students used to say that these notes are pure gold, gold in which all their knowledge is squeezed
 khaskar diarect-indiarect ke liye to unase acchhee gidence kahin se mil hi nahin sakati!"sab log yahan galati karte hai, par tum mere student ho main chaahoonga ki tumme se koi yah galati na kare
 "while listening to Joshi's head while teaching, i used to feel very good
 "inglish grammer
 
 
 ! Remember, this is a boon for you to bring Distinction marks in English
 isi se number milenge
 Just like if the question is correct in Mathematics, you get the whole number, similarly if you read my notes carefully, you will not be killed
 " joshi sar kaa daawa tha, jisamen koi atiranjana nahin
 Many older batches of his students could bear witness to this
 ∙∙yahi vajah thi ki hiskool ke papers se pehle jab pripareshan livj thim, main or subodh tab bhi daudkar unke paas ja pahonchte
 And on the last day when he had told everything related to the paper, there was just a request in his eyes, "work hard
 apane joshi sar ko niraash mat karnaa
 Remember, you two are my two eyes
 "usee din unhone bataaya, "dekho, pehali baar tumhen yah ek raaj bataa rahaa hoon
 That is that i had insisted with Principal Makhija Sahab himself and asked him for his Tenth class from you
 unhone meraa kahana nahin taala
 That is why i have so many expectations from you now
 "or tabhi pataa chalaa ki joshi sar ko barason se is bina par dasvin or barahavin kii classes nahin di ja rahi thim
 
 
 If they do Tharoo study, then there will not be much number of children
 par hamaari class ke liye joshi sar ad gaye ki "aap is baar tenth kii class mujhe dijie
 This time in English I'll give you at least two distractions! "" What! In Distinction English
 
 
 ? aaj tak to aisa hua nahin
 "makhija, the chubby principal with a fluffy mustache, was surprised
 "par jo kabhi nahin hua, vah bhi to kabhi na kabhi hota hi he
 "joshi sir laughed
 unki hansee main itani dridhtaa or aatmavishvaas tha ki principal makhija ko unki baat manani padi or unhone ‘haan’ kar diya
 However, what a huge challenge it must have been for Joshi sir, we were now getting an idea of it! We left by touching his feet
 phir jis din inglish kaa paper tha, usase ek din pehle bhi main or subodh unke ghar gaye
 Tapping the shoulders of both of us, he said, "I am sure, both of you will do something amazing this time
 tumhen kisi se ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he
 Even if there is a difficult issue, no one can stop you from bringing a distortion in English
 aakhir tum mere sabase laayak student ho!"itnaa bada ummiido kaa bhaar unhone hamaare sir par rakh diya tha ki use uthaate hue hamaare pair kaanp rahe the
 But when the high school results came, that dream had become a reality, which we were afraid to imagine
 us saal pehali baar inglish main do distinction ai thim or hamaare skool main vaaki ek nayaa ricard bana tha
 Subodh and i became known throughout the school
 5yon joshi sar jaise padhaate-padhaate hi buudhe hue
 Where did he retire even after retiring? The students studying in their homes would continue to be as usual and they would teach in great fun
 unke saath ke adhyaaapak shiksha kii dukaane lagaakar baithe the or joshi sar gyaan kii nadi baha rahe the
 Any Anjali could fill it with water
 haalaanki unke parivaar ke log, khaskar pita jo ritred sarkari afasar the, is sab se khush nahin the
 "hey Pran, people did tuition and built havelis, and you
 
 
 ! bas, yahi chota-sa ghar he na tumhaare paas
 "once the father came to meet him, he expressed his unhappiness
 joshi sar hanskar bole, "nahin-nahin pita ji, chota-sa kahan? hamaare liye to itnaa hi kaaphi he
 Who will handle it bigger than this? ”and the truth is that even that small house of his would always be full of books
 misses joshi—joshi sar jinhen kabhi damayanti to kabhi pyaar se dammo kahkar bulaate the- zyada padhi-likhi to na thim, par ve bhi saubhaahgya se bahut snehil thim or samay-asamay deraa jamaane vaale ham jaise students se katai chidhati na thim
 Sometimes she would also sit there
 hamaari or joshi sar kii baaten sunatin or musakaraati rahati thim
 The truth is that we have seen many houses, but there can be a house made of love, this feeling was only when Joshi sir went home
 joshi sar kaa betaa sukant idhar barason se america main tha
 He did engineering from Allahabad and got a good job
 company ne paanch saal ke liye use america bhej diya or phir vahiin apni pasand kii ladki se shaadi karke, usne america main hi basane kaa faisla kar liya
 Only husband and wife are left
 
 
 yani joshi sar or misses joshi
 Ideal Hindustani couple surrounded by simplicity and love
 kai baar ham log sochate, “ghar par itnaa samay ham joshi sar kaa lete hai
 Doesn't it bother Mrs
 Joshi? "but she knew her husband and his beloved craze and that he was alive
 isiilie sukant ne bhale hi bisiyon baar unhen america bulaayaa, par ve nahin gaye
 Mrs
 Damayanti Joshi was also no less than Joshi sir in this matter
 koi teen baras pehle misses joshi gujarin heart atake se
 For the first time after his departure, Joshi sir felt a little weak and broken
 ve kahin na kahin akele padate ja rahe the
 However, his courage and life-style were not broken
 maine kabhi unhen duusare ritred logon kii tarah maujuuda vakt yaa nai peedi ko koste nahin dekha
 Used to say, "in every round, time determines its mood
 haan, ham puraane samay ke log hai, to apana tarika chhod nahin sakate
 "even at this age he used to get pleasure by doing all the work himself
 bete sukant kii jid, "papa, aap choubees ghante kaa koi naukar rakh lijie
 Do not worry about money at all
 main sara kharchaa doongaa
 "joshi Sir replies to this," Son, slowly from morning to night, i do all the work and the car is moving
 ek baar baitha to phir baitha hi rah jaaounga
 Then no servant will be able to do anything
 or america main baithe hue tum bhi bhala kitna kar loge?"is bich bete sukant kaa america aane kaa aagrah nirantar badhata gaya
 But Joshi sir's insistence in his place saare student, jo unase maar kha-khaakar pakke hue the, har din unka haalchaal pataa karte hi rahete the
 There were people sitting on high positions like bank manager to secretary, who proudly told us that we are Joshi sir's students
 or jab unke student milane aate, to joshi sar kii khushi band todakar bah nikalati
 He would become very young while talking, as if he had thrown down the mountain of age
 6abhi koi saal bhar pehle kii baat, main or subodh unase milane gaye the
 Joshi sir was so happy that happiness was bursting from inside and outside
 "kaise ho tum log?" unhone canpakanpate honton se poocha
 He kept asking about family and family till late
 phir khud hi chaay banane ke liye uthne vaale the ki unhen badi mushkil se hamane is baat ke liye raji kiya ki chaay main or subodh milakar banaayenge
 After a while, placing the cup of tea in front of him, i said, "sir, we too are your sons
 " sunakar unki ankhen thodi bhig gain
 "you guys are so nice, or who remembers who these days?" Saying that the voice of Joshi sir was drenched
 "nahin sar, aisa na kahen
 You made us khud apane haathon se aapane hamaara vyaktitv gadha he, jisase kabhi koi galat kaam nahin hua hamase or kabhi ham kisi ke aage jhuke nahin
 "subodh said
 mujhase to itnaa bhi nahin kaha gaya
 Don't know what i wanted to say? Throat strangled There was no speech from the lips
 "ejineering main aakar vah inglish to chhot hi gai jis par aap jor dete rahe, par joshi sar, main aaj bhi vahaan sabase acchhee angreji likhata-bolta hoon!" subodh ne kaha to unke chehre par ajab-si ardrata thi
 It was not self-realization, a feeling of being full and broken
 mujhe yaad ai barason pehle kahi gai joshi sar kii baat ki, "dekho paresh, maine tumhen itnaa pakkaa or majboot base diya he ki tumhen kahin kisi ke aage jhukne kii jarurat nahin he
 Never forget that you are my student
 "maine unhen yaad dilaayaa to hansane lage
 a weak laugh, but sweetly paced
 par agle hi pal na jane kaise mujhe nawein darje kaa murga na banane vaala prasang yaad aa gaya
 i chuckled, "and yes sir, i don't even need to be a cock - even if i have to do a satyagraha in front of you or someone else!" They laughed blissfully in that state of weakness
 phir kuch rukkar bole, "paresh, sach kahoon to usee din se mere man me tumhaari ek alag image bani
 You did not see that in fifteen minutes the whole class became cocky
 sab murga banate gaye or apni apni seat par baithte gaye
 Even comprehensible
 lekin us din kaa baaki puraa period or aglaa period bhi tumhaare saath jhik-jhik karte beetaa
 On the same day, i understood which paths your life will follow
 or aaj tumhen bataa rahaa hoon ki us din maine haar maani thi tumse
 You were small, but there was something in you that i had to lose
 vah ab bhi he tumme or main chaahoonga ki hameshaa bani rahe
 "I and Subodh touched my feet while walking, so they blessed," Be happy and do great things in life
 
 
 !"phir subodh ko ishaare se paas bulaakar kaha, "dekho subodh, mujhe pataa he, tum to sab sanbhaal loge
 But i still worry about Paresh sometimes
 agar kabhi vah kisi musiibat main pade to tum use sanbhaalanaa
 "and Subodh's hand was tight on my shoulder
 yah sab itnaa aakasmik tha ki main hakkaa-bakka rah gaya
 i felt that if i did not stop myself, i would start crying bitterly
 unhen pranaam karke ham nikle, to baahar aakar gaadi start karte hue subodh ne kaha tha, "meraa man kahata he paresh, ab zyada samay nahin he
 Probably a year-six months at the most
 dekh nahin rahe the, kaise unke haath canpakanpa rahe the chaay pite vakt!" kehete-kehete uski ankhen bhar ai thim, meri bhi
 4 and today
 
 
 ! usee subodh ko phone karuun or phone par soochna don ki hamaare pyaare or duniya main sabase niraale or laajawab joshi sar nahin rahe- yah jimmaa mujh par he
 But how can i say, how is it possible that our Joshi sir is no more? Words will come out of my throat? i have picked up the phone, but my hands are still shivering

 In the new era, the mobile phone resting on your palm is also entertaining and creating new stars
 kya virtual duniya ke in sitaron ke paas kisi bollywood nayak kii tarah kii prashansakon kii fouj or sabase badi baat, utani badi kamai he?beshak he
 Its best example is youtuber Bhuvan Bam, whose channel has more than 1
5 crore subscribers and their videos get millions of views
 balm ke channel ko duniyabar main 218veen rekking hasil he or yah duniya ke sabase adhik dekhe jane vaale channelon main bhi shaamil he
 And earning? No less than any Bollywood celebrity
 media reports ke mutabik, balm kii salanaa kamai karodon rupye main he
 Bhuvan Bam did not become famous like this
 unamem kai fan hai
 He plays many roles in his videos ranging from Titu Mama and Janaki Ji to Banchodas and shoots himself
 isse unke darshakon main kabhi-kabhi bhram kii sthiti paidaa ho jaati he, jisamen unhen bada anand aata he
 He says, "my characters are superfluous versions of ordinary people
" kai baar log samaj hi nahin pate ki sabhi kirdaar maine hi nibhaae hai
 If they address me as Tito Mama, that's right
 ''haalanki, balm kii sangeet main gahari dilchaspee he or unhone kai manchon ke jariye apni is medha kaa pradarshan bhi kiya he, par mashhoor hone kaa jariya to utyub hi bana
 a satirical video of Bam, inspired by Johnny Lever, Kader Khan and Govinda, then went viral in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal and began to become a well-known name on youtube
 par tab tak unke gharavaale isse bekhbar the
 In his mother Padma Bam's office in Faridabad, someone shot a video of Bhuvan in a loud voice
 maa ne poochtacha kii to bhuwan ne papa ko nahin bataane kaa anurodh kiya
 Bam smilingly says, "it cannot be that you ask the mother-father to hide something from each other and they agree
" donon ek-duusare ke bahut sage hote hai
 "as a result, at dinner, Father Avanindra Bam had said softly, show us the video which the mother saw in the office
 video dekhakar papa ne ummid ke ulat pratikriya di thi or kaha, ''are, ye to ham bhi karte the skool main
 Talking about the various characters he played, Bhuvan says that he tries to tell the previous stories of those people in a new way and in terms of new people but a little exaggerated
 unki yah koshish kaamyaab he or unke charitra aam logon jaise dikhne lagate hai
 His characters are middle-class and probably also very popular for the same reason
 balm maheene main mahaj ek yaa do video hi post karte hai
 He says, "I think, that's enough
" itnaa kaam karne se main khush rahata hum
 Need time to do good work
 ek karod logon kii ummiido par khara utarana jaruri he
 "he says with a laugh," If you are abused, then the misbehavior of one crore people will come together and you cannot bear it
 ''balm kehete hai, ''main kabhi-kabhi taarkik hone, adhik mazaakia banane or behatar saamagree taiyaar karne kii koshish karata hum
 i don't think i have even achieved two percent of what i imagined
 kai baar to shaq hota he ki jo maine banaaya vah logon ko pasand aayega bhi yaa nahin
 "but the truth is that there is no scope for doubt now
" bhuwan balm ne apane kaam se vah haisiyat or shoharat hasil kar lee he jiske aage bollywood ke sitare bhi phna hai
 The first video was just 15 views at matching point 2015, when the first video on youtube went viral in Pakistan and Nepal
 More than 150 million youtube subscribers, more than 2 billion views, millions of successes alone work
 likhane se lekar shooting or sampadan tak
 Less videos post but do not compromise quality
 Popularity factors always speak of the middle class

 His characters are among the common people *** rajasthan ke dhaulpur main barish ke liye kuch logon ne teen naaballig ladakiyon ko in bheeshan garmi main aag ke paas bhukhe-psaase baitha rakhaa he
 The three girls have been sitting on austerity in the midst of fire for the last five days and people sitting around them are doing bhajan kirtan
 barish na hone se pareshaan kisaan is tarah keandhvishwaska sahaara le rahe hai
 According to traditional stories, to celebrate Indra, the god of rain, he is feeding children a meal of Anga-dal by setting them in the sun at the Siddha sites and squares

 in teenon ladakiyon ne is dauraan khaanaa to dur pani kaa ek boond tak nahin piya he
 It is believed that these houses and villagers are the only hand in pushing these girls into the fire of superstition, but to avoid the police-administration, these people are saying that these girls sat on austerity without telling them
 vahiin prashasan bhi isaki khabar milane par bacchiyon ko uthaane ke liye pahunchi, lekin un bacchiyon ne yah kahkar vahaan se uthne se inkaar kar diya ki jab tak barish nahin hoti, ve vahaan se hilengi nahin
 As soon as the news of this tenacity of these girls spread, women and men from the vicinity are also reaching there in large numbers
 ye log tap kar rahi in bacchiyon kii puja kar rahe hai or bhajan kirthan main jute hai
 Despite the forecast of good monsoon from the Meteorological Department this year, due to lack of rain in the Dholpur district, lines of concern have started appearing on the face of farmers
 july kaa puraa pakhwada sookhaa guzarane ke baad kharif kii bubaai main baithe kisaan ab akaash kii ore aashaa bhari najaron se dekh rahe hai
 Fateh Singh, a farmer of the area, says that the month of July is coming out
 barish nahin hone ke kaaran buvaai bhi deree se hui or ab pani nahin hone se fasal nasht hone kii kagaar par he
 Due to lack of rain, the kharif crop is suffering a lot and now we are in the shelter of God
 maukey par maujuud pratap singh kehete hai ki june or july ke maheene main do-teen baar barish hui, lekin uske baad barish nahin hone ke chalate kharif kii bubaai kaa samay lagbhag nikal sa chukaa he or saare khet viraan dikh rahe hai
 Let me tell you that the last time similar minor girls were seated on austerities for rain, then the police-administration sued the families and admitted the girls to the hospital

 In everyday life, some words of English have climbed our tongue in such a way that we are speaking them without thinking
 kai shabd to aise hai jinka koi matlab hi nahin he bas, ham hindi main unhengis tarah boltehain usee tarah hamane english main bhibolnaa shuru karadia he
 Apart from this, there are some words which we do not know the correct meaning and we use them in the wrong sense
 aaie jaanate hai kuch aise hi shabdon ke bare main:1
 Often we speak First Come First Serve
 iskaa matlab hota he jo pehle aayaa he wo un logon ko sarv karegaa jo baad main aae hai
 Speaking First Come First Serve is incorrect
 agar ise sahi bolnaa he to ham bolengexirst Come First Served, jiskaa sahi matlab he ki agar aap pehle aae ho to aapako pehle sarv kiya jayega
 It is clear that removing and applying just one alphabet changes the meaning of the entire word and sentence
 2
 Often, the college or school from which we have studied, we tell ourselves the Pass Out student there
 lekin asal main jab aap kisi ajukeshan institute se padhai kar chuke hote hai to aap vahaan ke graduate hote hai
 You are not a Pass Out from that institute
 Pass outka matlab hota he to become unconscious for a short time yani kuch samay ke liye behosh hona
 4
 kai log bolte handdhischuss About
 For example, let's discuss about politics
 lekincdhischuss aboutkoi phrase nahin he
 Discuss only means Talk About
 isliye alag sendhischusske badasaboutshabda lagane kii jarurat nahin hoti
 For example: Let's discuss politics
 5
 Most of us often speak Do One Thing, which is meant to work
 vastav main iskaa koi sens hi nahin he
 You will be mocked for speaking like this abroad
 6
 When we ask someone's name in Hindi, they say what is your auspicious name? In translating this, we are also asking in English what is your good name? This is absolutely wrong
 sahi taur par poocha janaa chahieithhat is your name?7
 Another common mistake we make is also using Kindly Revert
 kindlyrevertko hamasheplyyani ki jawaab paane ke arth main bolte hai, jo ki galat he
 Revert means: Go back to a previous state
 yani ki apni puraani sthiti main waapas aana
 Therefore it is wrong to use Kindly Revert for Reply
 8
 Often people are not able to differentiate between Sneak Peek and Sneak Peak
 peekka matlab hota hessduichk lookora peakka matlab hota he pahaad kii chotii
 With both e and a removed, the meaning of both changed
 jab hamakshnlak peakbolemge to iskaa koi matlab nahin hoga
 So the correct Phrase that is spoken is Sneak Peek, which means getting a chance to see something before it is officially launched
 9
 Most of us speak Prostate as prostrate
 sirfshelfabet ko lagane se hi arth badal gaya he
 Prostrate means when you are sitting with your face down
 vahiin, purushon ke janaanangon main pai jane vaali granthi conefrosttekaha jaataa he
 If you speak Prostrate Cancer, then it means cancer that has been caused by you sitting face down
 isliye iskaa sahi Phrase harrfrostte Cancer
 10
 agar koi apni baat se you-turn letaa he to ham kehete hai360-degree Turn
 Whereas 360-degree Turn means coming back to the place from where it started
 hamen kisi ke you-turn lene par kahana chahie180-degree Turn, jiskaa matlab hota he ki vah apni pehali kahi gai baat se thik ulataa kar rahaa he

 On 26 May, one year of opposition is being completed
 sarkaar ke saath-saath vipaksh kaa bhi moolyankan kiya janaa chahie
 What has been the role of the opposition during the entire year and what is its action plan in terms of the completion of one year of the Modi government
 kya vipaksh ne is maukey par satahi narebaazi ke alaava koi thos aalochana pesh kii he
 The opposition has acted to deny the claims of the government, but whether such options have been presented on its behalf, such arguments have been formed which raise a lot of doubt in the minds of the public towards the intention of the government
 sirf chand maukon par sarkaar kii chook kaa laabh uthaakar virodh karnaa hi vipaksh kaa kaam nahin he
 i also do not want to evaluate the opposition on how many policies played a positive role by supporting the government, but also on what concrete challenge was given to the big plans of the government at ideological level
 ho saktaa he vipaksh ne chunauti di bhi ho lekin wo chunauti bade str par darj ho iskaa prayaas to kam hi dikhataa he
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh leaves the preparations for his son's marriage and press conference to raise questions on the Modi government, there are two press conferences from the Congress side but nothing more
 baaki dalon kii sakriyata bhi press conference se zyaada kii nahin he
 As the work of the government has remained to be claimed, the work of the opposition has been dismissed
 main tivi kam dekhtaa hum lekin phir bhi andaaza he ki pichley ek hafte se sarkaar ke mantri news channelon ke studio main is tarah se haazir rahe hai jaise vahi unka mantralay ho
 Many times, the minister was seen leaving this studio and going to the studios of that channel
 yahaan ravishankar prasad to vahaan nitin gadakari
 By converting strict or serious programs of question and answer into Jalsa, the friendly formality of asking was completed
 vahi buniyadi sawaal puche gaye jo ek saal se tivi kaaryakramon main puche hi ja rahe the
 The spokespersons of the government or BJP were answering those questions very well, but on the occasion of one year, our journalists with ground research, including myself, were not present
 khaaskar tivi vaale patrkaar
 Like the audience, the opposition is watching TV or on the call of journalists, goes to the studio and refutes every claim
 sabane is tathy ko sweekaar kar liya ki ab centre sarkaar rose 12 kimi sadak bana rahi he lekin sadak parivahan or haive mantralay kii site se kuch or jaankaree milti he
 It is written on the website that in 2013-14 and 2014-15, there was a target to build 6,300 km of roads
 2013-14 yani upie ke samay 4,260 kimi sadaken baniin or endie ke samay 4,410 kimi
 Why did the new government set the target of the old government and why is there a slight difference in terms of completion? yah kendriya sadak parivahan rajya mantri kaa rajya sabha main diya gaya bayaan he
 In the same way, some reports of cleanliness campaign exposed type were heard but no one asked how many cleanliness workers have been hired under this campaign
 shahar-gaanv saaf rahe iske liye kya system banegaa
 The goal of cleanliness is not met only by having toilets in every house
 gandagi dikhni kam bhi nahin hui he balki waisi hi dikhti he jaisi dikhti thi
 Shouldn't it have been asked how many accident insurance have been received so far under the Jan Dhan Yojana
 kitne khate main sarkaar paise jamaa kara rahi he
 How many accountants of Jan Dhan have overdrafted Rs 5,000
 jab yah pataa chal saktaa he ki 15,500 karod jamaa ho gaye hai, to ye sab kyon nahin pataa chal saktaa
 i do not say that no one would have asked or answered
 diya hoga magar in antarvirodhon ko ubhaarne kaa kaam sirf patrkaar kaa nahin he
 The task of reaching out to the public is also that of the lazy opposition who counts every day the government's chances of faltering and fulfills its obligation by holding a press conference
 thik he ki kisaanon ke mudde par kuch netaaon ne daure kiye or sakriyata dikhaai lekin uske baad kya
 Did this Opposition present any policy on behalf of the government's agricultural policies and forced you to go this way or else the farmers would be killed
 vipaksh kaa kaam rokna nahin he
 His job is also to get the government to do good work
 yah poochna hota he ki kitne logon ko naukariyaan milin or milin to iskaa vishwasaneey aankada kahaan se aata he
 Even if it does not come in the earlier government, but the questions of expectations from this government can be questioned
 tippaniyan The government has been active in delivering its views for the last one week
 mathura main pradhanmantri raily karne vaale hai
 The government and BJP together will hold 200 press conferences across the country
 arun jetali lagaataar press conference kar rahe hai
 But the opposition has been slow in the mid-summer
 sarkaar ke daavon ko chunauti dene kii uski koi yojana nazar nahin aati
 Will the Congress also hold 400 press conferences in response? kya rahul gandhi press ke saamne aakar sarkaar ke daavon ko chunauti denge
 The slogans of 'suit, boot ki sarkar' or 'government of a few industrialists' are easy slogans
 zarur in naaron se sarkaar ko pareshaani hui he or wo lagaataar apni garib virdohi chhavi ko counter karne main juty hui he magar iske alaava vipaksh kya kar rahaa he
 Probably happy to see his slogans becoming headlines
 rahul gandhi kii padayatraaen kaaphi nahin hai vipaksh kii bhoomika kaa moolyankan karne ke liye
 There should also be a strict assessment of the opposition this year
 sansad ke donon sadanon main chand muddon par sakriyata ko chhod den to vipaksh ko samaj hi nahin aa rahaa he ki baaki yojanaon ko lekar sarkaar ko kaise gheraa jaae
 Not only to circle but also to educate the public about why these schemes are not in its interest
 vipaksh se poocha janaa chahie ki sarkaar kii badi yojanaon ko lekar vaicharik or vyaavhaarik soch kya he
 The opposition did not present any political outlook on the smart city
 jandhan yojana yaa beemaa yojana ke bare main koi sawaal nahin kiya
 Except to say that this was our only plan
 shram kanoonon main jo sudhaar hue he wo mazaduron ke liye acha he yaa bura he
 What are its claims different from the government's claims on collaborative federalism
 ye sab wo mudde hai jin par gambhir adhyayan karnaa padataa he, chintan kii lambii or eemaandaar prakriya se guzaranaa hota he
 Yourself has to be dismissed and raised anew
 vipaksh kaa bartaav us vidhyaarthee kii tarah he jo bas yahi sochakar nakhun chabaata rahata he ki agle ke usase do number kam aa jaae
 It was known that after losing the election, the leaders start sleeping in the afternoon and the government stumbles over its mistakes and goes back to power
 janata parivaar kii ekta ke asafal naatak jaise javaabon ko bhi vipaksh ke hisaab main shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 The Congress may be less in number against the BJP, but there are many parties in the opposition with the numbers around it
 kya in sabhi dalon ne milakar koi saajha kaarykram ke bare main sochaa jisase sarkaar ko bhi chunauti milti or ek behatar pratispardhaa bhi hoti
 It may have been a challenge from the opposition, but the challenge should be recorded on a large scale
 congress netaa digvijay singh apane bete kii shaadi kii taiyaariyaan chhodkar press conference kar modi sarkaar par sawaal to khadey karte hai, congress kii taraf se ek do press conference bhi hoti he lekin isse zyaada kuch nahin hota he
 The activism of the other parties is not more than the press conference
 jaise sarkaar kaa kaam daawa karnaa rah gaya he vaise hi vipaksh kaa kaam khaarij karnaa ho gaya he
 i watch TV less but still know that for the last one week, the ministers of the government have been appearing in the studios of news channels in such a way that they are their ministry
 kai baar to mantri is studio se nikalakar us channel ke studio main jate bhi dikhe
 Ravi Shankar Prasad here and Nitin Gadkari there
 sawaal-jawaab ke sakht yaa gambhir kaaryakramon ko jalsa main badal kar puch lene kii dostana aupchaarikta hi puri hui
 The same basic questions were asked which were being asked in TV programs for a year
 sarkaar yaa bijepi ke pravaktaa un sawaalon kaa koob jawaab de rahe the lekin ek saal ke maukey par jamini shodh ke saath hamaare patrkaar, jisamen main bhi shaamil hum, kam hi haazir rahe
 Especially the TV journalist
 vipaksh bhi darshakon kii tarah tivi dekh rahaa he yaa patrakaron ke bulaane par studio jaakar har daawey kaa khandan kar aata he
 Everyone accepted the fact that now the central government is constructing 12 km of road every day, but some more information comes from the site of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
 website par likhaa he ki 2013-14 or 2014-15 main 6,300 kimi sadak banane kaa lakshya tha
 In 2013-14, 4,260 km of roads were built during UPA and 4,410 km at the time of NDA
 nai sarkaar ne puraani sarkaar ke hi lakshya ko kyon rakhaa or puraa karne ke maamle main maamuli antar kyon he
 This is the statement made by the Union Minister of State for Road Transport in the Rajya Sabha
 usee tarah se swatchta abhiyaan kaa pardaafash tip kii kuch report kaa zikr to suna lekin kisi ne nahin poocha ki is abhiyaan ke tahat kitne safai karmchaariyon ko rakhaa gaya he, rakhaa jayega
 What system will be in place to keep the city and village clean? sirf har ghar main shauchalay banane se hi swatchta kaa lakshya to puraa nahin ho jaataa he
 The dirt is not reduced to look but looks like it used to look
 kya yah nahin poocha janaa chahie tha ki jandhan yojana ke tahat abhi tak durghatana beemaa kitnon ko mili he
 How many accounts are the government depositing money into
 jandhan ke kitne khatedaaron ne 5,000 rupee kaa overdraft kiya he
 When it can be known that 15,500 crores have been accumulated, then why cannot all this be known
 main yah nahin kahata ki kisi ne nahin poocha hoga yaa jawaab nahin diya hoga
 It may have given, but it is not just the work of the journalist to highlight these contradictions
 janata tak pahunchane kaa kaam us aalsee vipaksh kaa bhi he jo har din sarkaar ke ladkadaane ke maukey ginata he or press conference kar apana daayitv puraa kar detaa he
 Well, some leaders have visited and shown activism on the issue of farmers, but what after that
 kya isi vipaksh ne sarkaar kii krishi nitiyon ke vikalp main apni taraf se koi niti pesh kii or baadhya kiya ki aap is raste chaliye varna kisaan maare jaaenge
 The work of the opposition is not to be stopped
 uskaa kaam sarkaar se achche kaam karana bhi hota he
 One has to ask how many people got jobs and where does the reliable data come from
 bhale hi pehle kii sarkaar main nahin aata ho, lekin ummiido kii is sarkaar se dhang ke sawaal to kiye hi ja sakate hai
 The comments sarkaar pichley ek hafte se apni baat pahunchane ke liye sakriy he
 The Prime Minister is about to rally in Mathura
 sarkaar or bijepi milakar desh bhar main 200 press conference karne vaale hai
 Arun Jaitley is constantly holding press conferences
 lekin vipaksh garmi kii dopahari main susta rahaa he
 It does not see any plan to challenge the claims of the government
 kya congress bhi jawaab main 400 press conference karegi
 Will Rahul Gandhi come before the press and challenge the government's claims
 'suut, boot kii sarkaar' yaa 'chand udyogpatiyon kii sarkaar' ke naare to aasaan naare hai
 Surely the government has been troubled by these slogans and is constantly trying to counter its anti-poor image, but apart from this what is the opposition doing
 shaayad apane naaron ko hedline banate dekh khush ho rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi's footsteps are not enough to evaluate the role of the opposition
 is ek saal main vipaksh kaa bhi sakht moolyankan hona chahie
 Except the activism on a few issues in both the houses of Parliament, the opposition does not understand how to surround the government with the rest of the plans
 na sirf gheraa jaae balki janata ko is bare main bhi shikshit kiya jaae ki kyon ye yojanaayen uske hit main nahin hai
 Opposition should be asked what is the ideological and pragmatic thinking about big schemes of the government
 vipaksh ne smart city par koi rajnatik nazariyaa pesh nahin kiya
 No questions asked about Jan Dhan Yojana or Bima Yojana
 sivaay yah bataane ki ye to hamaari hi yojana thi
 The reforms in the labor laws are good or bad for the workers
 sahyogi sanghavaad par sarkaar ke daavon se alag uske daawey kya hai
 These are issues on which serious study has to be done, going through a long and honest process of thinking
 khud ko kaarij kar nae sire se khadaa karnaa hota he
 The opposition behaves like a student who just chews the nail thinking that the next number is two less
 wo zamana gaya ki chunaav haarane ke baad netaa dopaher kii neend khinchne lagate hai or sarkaar apni galatiyon se ladkadhaakar chali jaati he or ve phir satta main aa jate hai
 Responses such as the unsuccessful drama of Janata Parivar unity should also be included in opposition
 bijepi ke kilaaf congress bhale hi sankhya main kam ho lekin iske aas paas kii sankhya vaale vipaksh main kai dal he
 Did all these parties together think of a common program that would challenge the government as well as a better competition
 main tivi kam dekhtaa hum lekin phir bhi andaaza he ki pichley ek hafte se sarkaar ke mantri news channelon ke studio main is tarah se haazir rahe hai jaise vahi unka mantralay ho

 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Sachin Tendulkar, who was an important part of the Indian team in the last six World Cups, will not be seen in this cricket maha Kumbh for the first time, but despite this, many records of master blaster in this tournament to be held every four years will remain untouched
 tendulkar ne 1992 se 2011 tak lagaataar chah vishwacap main hissaa liya, jisamen unhone 45 match kii 44 pariyon main 56
 He scored 2278 runs at an average of 95, which is the record for this tournament
 yah sunishchit he ki unka yah record is baar achoota rahegaa
 In the list of batsmen who have scored the most runs after Tendulkar in the World Cup, former Australia captain Ricky Ponting is named who has retired from cricket like this Indian
 ponting ne 46 maichon main 1743 ran banaae hai
 Among the players who will play in the World Cup starting from 14 February in Australia and New Zealand, Kumar Sangakkara has the highest score of 991 runs
 unke baad srilanka ke hi ek anya ballebaaj mahela jayavardhane (975 ran) kaa number aata he
 Sangakkara would need 1287 to reach Tendulkar's parity and Jayawardene to 1303 which seems unlikely
 kisi ek vishwacap main sarvaadhik ran kaa record tendulkar ke naam par hi he
 He scored 673 runs in 11 matches in 2003
 tendulkar kaa kisi ek desh main sarvaadhik ran banane kaa record bhi bana rahegaa
 He has scored 977 runs in 15 matches on Indian soil
 vartmaan samay ke kisi bhi khilaadi ne abhi tak australia yaa newjiland main vishwa cap match nahin khelaa he
 Tendulkar, who has scored 100 centuries in international cricket, has set a record six hundreds in the World Cup
 vartmaan ke ballebaajon main abi divilliars or jayavardhane ke naam par teen-teen shatak darj hai
 Both these batsmen are in good form and in such a situation, their eyes will be on the record of Tendulkar's most centuries
 lekin tendulkar ke ardhshtakon ke record tak pahunchnaa kisi ke liye mushkil hoga
 This star batsman has scored 15 fifties in this 50-over competition
 unke baad jaak kallis (nau ardhshtak) kaa number aata he jo sanyas le chuke hai
 Among the players participating in the World Cup, Sangakkara is on top with seven fifties
 vishwacap main sarvaadhik chakke jadne kaa record riki ponting ke naam par he
 He has hit 31 sixes
 unke baad harshal gibs (28), tendulkar or jayasoorya (donon 27 chakke) kaa number aata he
 But Tendulkar is number one in terms of fours
 unhone chah vishwacap main ricard 241 chauke lagaae hai
 Tendulkar is followed by Ponting (145) and Adam Gilchrist (141)
 vartmaan ballebaajon main jayavardhane or sangakaara donon ne samaan 90 chauke lagaaye hai
 To reach Tendulkar's record, he will need to hit 151 fours
 record ke liye bataa den ki kisi ek vishwacap main sarvaadhik 75 chauke lage the
 Tendulkar did this feat in the 2003 World Cup played on the African continent
 vishwa cap udghaatan match 14 farvari ko srilanka or newjiland ke bich khelaa jayega or tab sangakaara 91 ran banaate hi record bana denge
 De Villiers will also reach this record by Tendulkar after scoring 102 against West Indies
 dakshin africa or westeindies 27 farvari ko sidney main aamane saamne honge
 The record of facing the most balls in the World Cup and spending the most minutes at the crease is also in Tendulkar's name
 unhone vishwacap main 2560 gendon kaa saamana kiya he
 Apart from him, only one other batsman faced more than 2000 balls
 vah ponting (2180 genden) hai
 Sangakkara and Jayawardene lead the current batsmen in this record
 unhone kramash: 1259 or 1112 genden kheli hai
 Sangakkara would have to play 1301 and Jayawardene 1448 balls to reach Tendulkar's record
 krij par sabase adhik samay bitaane kii baat karen to tendulkar ne vishwacap main 3641 minute ballebaaji kii
 Ponting (2899 minutes) is in second place while Sangakkara (1908 minutes) tops the current time
 tendulkar se yah srilankai ballebaaj 1733 minute peeche he

 upi kii yogi adityanath sarkaar ke mantri swami prasad maury teen talaak ko lekar apane bayaan par kaayam hai
 On Friday, he said that some Muslim men divorce their wives due to lust
 ajtak ke saath khaas baatcheet main maury apane bayaan par kaayam rahe
 He reiterated that behind the triple talaq there is some bad mentality and humility
 unhone teen talaak ke masale ko raajnneeti se dur rakhane kii piem modi kii apil kaa bhi samarthan kiya
 The Prime Minister's response was welcomed by the Prime Minister's statement in this regard
 unka kahana tha ki piem kaa bayaan puure desh ke liye ahm he
 According to Maurya, the way Muslim women are walking around on the street is a serious issue for any society
 unhone kaha ki koi bhi majahab insaaniyat ke saath darindagi kaa paigaam nahin detaa he
 In the opinion of Maurya, the issue of triple talaq has become a joke
 unka daawa tha ki log ghar aane main deree or chaay main chini kam hone jaisi choti-choti baton par bhi talaak de rahe hai
 According to Maurya, this brings Muslim women on the road and their children's lives are also destroyed
 'teen talaak ke peeche ochhi maansikta'maury maanate hai ki teen talaak ke peeche choti soch he
 He said that already the number of women in the country is much less than men
 lihaaja teen yaa chaar baar shaadi karnaa bhartiya samaaj main vyavhaarik nahin he
 He claimed that in Sharia also, divorces are not allowed unnecessarily
 maury ne daawa kiya ki bijepi muslim mahilaon ko unka haq dilaane kii koshish kar rahi he or baaki partiyon ko bhi iskaa samarthan karnaa chahie
 The Nishamuslim Personal Law Board on the Muslim Board is strongly opposed to the government's stand on triple talaq
 maury kaa kahana tha ki board ke jo moulana is masale par bol rahe hai unhen muslim mahilaon ko adhikaar dilaane ke liye jubaan kholani chahie
 He also advised the board members to look into Gireban

 Here BJP candidate VK Singh and Aam Aadmi Party's Shazia Ilmi are face to face
 AAP pratyaashee ne jubaani prahaar kii shuruyaat karte hue kah diya he ki army ke general ko raajnneeti main nahin aana chahie
 He said that by taking the general from Ghaziabad, the BJP has made a scapegoat
 shajia ne wike singh ko naseehat dete hue kaha ki hamaari army pakistan kii army nahin he
 General VK Singh is stung by this statement of Shazia
 unhone shajia kii shikaayat chunaav ayog se kar di he
 VK Singh interpreted it in such a way that Shazia was saying that if a military contests elections, then there will be a situation like Pakistan
 baharhaal shajia apane bayaan par kaayam hai 
 He has even told Smriti Irani and Rahul Gandhi the same plate
 shajia ne rajnath singh ke gajiabad seat chhodane par chutki lete kaha ki bijepi adhyaksh seat chhodkar bhaag gaye the
 In the eyes of the Election Commission, whether these statements are objectionable or not, only time will tell
 lekin isse gajiabad main bijepi or AAP pratyaashee aamane-saamne jarur aa gaye hai
 Meanwhile, VK Singh said that he is putting the issues of getting Ghaziabad on the lines of Delhi
 unke prachaar vaale panfalet main yah bhi likhaa he ki unki tarif anna hajaare bhi kar chuke hai
 Shazia Ilmi is also making claims of development
 unka kahana he ki vah chunaav main front ranor hai or aam aadmi party yahaan se chunaav jeetne ja rahi he
 However, Shazia has already won another controversy in Ghaziabad
 vah ek mandir main gai thim, jiskaa ulimaon ne virodh bhi kiya tha

 lekin isamen sarkaar ne suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye driveron ko training dene kii bhi vyavastha kii he
 The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has taken this decision to benefit skilled people from economically weaker sections of the society
 bataa den ki kendriya motor vaahan niyam, 1989 ke rule 8 ke antargat driveron ko kaksha 8 paas hona jaruri he
 They also had to meet at least an eighth qualification qualification for the license
 desh main vishesh rup se gaanvon main badi sankhya main aise berozegaar hai jinke paas digriyaan nahin hai
 They are literate and skilled despite not being formally trained
 mantralay kii is pahal se unhen rojgaar ke maukey milenge
 Referring to the recent meeting held in the Transport Ministry, the Haryana government had requested to remove the condition of educational qualification for drivers of the economically backward Mewat region
 yah aisa ilaaka he jahaan kam aay vaali badi aabaadi kii aajeevika driving par nirbhar he

 But the cold and cold wave is going on in Bihar

 Tejashwi said that there has been a law against child marriage and dowry for many years, but it has not been strictly implemented in Bihar in the last 13 years and Nitish Kumar should answer for it
 tejasvi ne kaha ki bal vivaah or dahej pratha ke khilaaf jhootha shrey lene ke liye nitish kumaar maanav shrinkhalaa kaa aayojan kar rahe hai
 Tejaswi expressed his condolences to the Chief Minister, demanding that the program that shines its face in the cold of the sizzle should be carried forward and when the weather is favorable, they should promote and spread it
 tejasvi ne kaha ki nitish sarkaar agar is kaarykram kii tithi ko aage badha detii he to isse bacchon ko kaaphi sahuuliyat hogi
 Tejashwi said that he is not against creating a human chain against marriage and dowry, but ignoring the human aspect to make his face shine is completely wrong

 lekin sensor board tital badalane ke faisle par adig rahaa
 When the producers felt that there was less than two weeks left in the release, they agreed to the suggestion of the censor, not escalating the controversy

 When the SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav came out of the Lok Sabha to meet the media in the Parliament House precinct at around 4 pm on December 19, the party MP Yashveer Singh's face in the house was not the fury of a scuffle with a Congress MP but victory
 And there was a sense of confidence
 lambey samay baad tan kar chalate hue khud media ke liye bane stand tak pahunchakar netaji bole, ''congress ke haath main sarkaar he
 Do the majority, which is arbitrary, but will have to answer among the public
 congress ne bahumat ke bal par hamaare saansad ko apamaanit kiya he
 "but when he was reminded that the majority of the government is on his own, he only said," The public is watching
 ”sarkari naukariyon main padonnati main aarakshan kaa maamla ab lokapal or mahila aarakshan bill kii qatari main khadaa ho gaya he, jahaan chaah to he lekin vot bank kii raajnneeti main sahmati kii koi raah nahin dikh rahi
 The same view was repeated in the Lok Sabha on 19 December in the Winter Session, as was the scuffle between the SP-BSP mps in the Rajya Sabha over the opposition to the same bill on 5 September in the monsoon session of Parliament
 sapa ne pehle se tay script ke mutabik carmik rajyamantri ve
 In order to snatch the bill from Narayanasamy, he pushed forward Dalit MP Yashveer Singh from Nagina reserved seat
 lekin achaanak congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne lapakkar yashavir se bill waapas lene kii koshish kii or kuch hi pal main congress saansad vilaas mutemvaar congress adhyaksh ke bachaav main yashavir se bhid gaye
 After this development, Mulayam alleged, "no incident of snatching the bill has happened in Parliament for the first time
" aisa pehle bhi hota rahaa he, lekin congress ke sadasyon ne hamaare pratishthit sadsy ko maarna shuru kar diya
 "but the very next day Yashveer expressed regret in front of the Lok Sabha speaker
 iske baavjood padonnati main aarakshan se sambandhit 117waan samvidhan sanshodhan bill loksabhaa main aakar atak gaya
 Despite sp's opposition in the Rajya Sabha on 17 December, the matter reached a decisive political turn with the passage of the bill by 206 votes, but the SP continued to protest in the Lok Sabha as per Mulayam's announcement
 unhone ek din pehle hi kah diya tha, ''yah bill asanvaidhanik or samaaj main bhedbhaav paidaa karne vaala he, isliye ham is bill kaa virodh karte rahenge or iske liye ham har parinaam bhugatne ko taiyaar hai
 "but the BSP supremo Mayawati has become sharper due to the stuck bill in the Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa main bill par bahes ke dauraan mayawati apane dal-bal ke saath vishesh gailaree main maujuud hokar puri kaarywahi dekh rahi thim, to udhar mushkil main fansi congress bill par aage badaae kii himmat nahin juta pai
 But Mayawati has now directly doubted the intention of the government
 apni naaraazgi kaa izhaar karte hue unhone kaha, ''loksabhaa main jab sapa saansadon ne bill kii prati phadi thi or sadan main hangaamaa kar rahe the to sarkaar ne un sadasyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii pahal nahin kii
 "she said that she would soon write a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and demand a special session of Parliament
 lekin maaya ke aaropon par grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia ne kaha ki loksabhaa main is bill ko paarit karaane ke liye khud sonia gandhi ne jo aakraamak tevar dikhaae, usase sarkaar kii gambhirtha kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 However, the biggest difficulty of the weak Congress in the statistics game is to carry both the SP-BSP together, so it is calling on both of them
 rajyasabha main mayawati ke tikhe tevar or sidhe sabhapati hamid ansaari par nishaanaa saadhane ke baad congress ne bijepi ke samarthan se bill ko paas karvaa liya, lekin loksabhaa main halaat vipareet ho gaye to sarkaar ne bhi ichhashakti nahin dikhaai
 sp's opposition did not find any partner in the Rajya Sabha, but it got Sanjeevani in the Lok Sabha at a time when the BJP got entangled in itself
 bijepi ke murali manohar joshi, yogi adityanath, menka gandhi sareekhe saansadon ne is bill kaa samarthan karne par pichhadon-savarnon kaa vot khisakane kii daleel di
 However, this matter was also raised in the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting
 lekin donon sadanon main alag-alag rukh apnaane par hone vaali fajihat se bachane ke liye bijepi ne spikar ke saath hui baithak main is bill par supreme court kii raay lene kaa pintara chal diya
 BJP leaders argued that the Parliament seems to be divided on the basis of caste, which may have a negative impact on the society
 haalanki is bill ko lekar carmik rajyamantri narayansami ne rajyasabha main spasht kiya ki aarakshan kii seemaa 22
 5 percent will remain
 unhone yah bhi spasht kiya ki 1995 se pehle pramotion paa chuke adhikariyon par is bill kaa asar nahin padegaa or iske liye ve rajyon ko chitthee likhenge
 According to a statement from the Ministry of Personnel, "there was a demand to maintain Article 335 regarding the efficiency of reservation in promotions
" jiske baad vidheyak main sanshodhan karke ''yaa anuchhed 335 main’’ shabdon ko hataa diya gaya tha, taaki anuchhed 335 main ullikhit kushalta kii shart samvidhan kaa hissaa bani rahe or ise hataaya na jaae
 Apart from this, it also ensures that the effect of the provision of Article 335 is maintained, in which the criteria for SC-ST related candidates are allowed to be relaxed in case of promotion on reserved vacancies
 ”upi main saamaanya or pichde varg ke karmchaaree-adhikariyon ne 'sarvajan hitay sangrakshan samiti’ ke binar tale congress-bijepi, bispi netaaon ke gharon kaa gheraav kiya
 And the symbolic cremation of leaders and the hanging of locks on offices broke out
 jabaki duusari ore 'aarakshan bachaao sangharsh samiti’ ne sarkari daftaron main chaar ghante zyada kaam karne kaa elaan kar diya
 Shailendra Dubey, chairman of Sarvajan Hitaya Patraan Samiti, says, "after the constitutional amendment, the SC-ST class will get the benefit of quota in promotion as well as the resultant seniority
 iske prabhaav main rajya ke 18 lakh karmchaaree aaenge
 In government departments, a junior employee of SC-ST will become the boss of a senior general class employee more than himself
 isse prashasnic mashinari dhwast ho jaaegi
 "however, there is the argument of Avadhesh Verma, chairman of Save Reservation Sangharsh Samiti," SC-ST officers will not be able to deploy to higher positions due to non-implementation of reservation in promotion
 ”spasht he ki pramotion main aarakshan kaa maamla adhar main latak gaya he or rajnatik dal ab supreme court se raay lene par jor de rahe hai

 For Royal Challengers Bangalore, Bangalore has been a matter of concern that despite batsmen like Kohli and AB de Villiers, she has not been able to win in her account
 pichley match main parthiv patel ne jarur ardhashatak jamaaya tha lekin unhen duusare chor se saath nahin mila tha

 He has been able to score less than 20 runs in four matches

 Australia defeated India 3–2 on the basis of a penalty shootout in the third Test match played at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium on Monday to win the three-match series 2–0
 nirdhaarit samay kii samaapti tak bharat ne yah match 3-2 se jeeta tha lekin siries kiske naam hoga, iskaa faisla penalty shootout se hona tha
 The reason for this was that both teams scored six goals in this series and both won one match each
 aise main siries ke vijeta kaa faisla karne ke liye shootout aprihaary ho gaya tha
 In the stipulated time, India took the lead by converting the first penalty corner into the goal
 bharat ke liye yah gol viaar raghunatha ne 17wein minute main kiya tha
 After this, in the 36th minute, Trent Mitton scored an excellent field goal, bringing his team on par
 match kaa teesraa or bharat kaa doosraa gol rupinder paal singh ne penalty carnor par kiya
 With this, India took the lead
 yah gol 41wein minute main hua
 But Trent Mitton scored a field goal in the 54th minute to put his team on par
 match barabari par samaapt hone kii sthiti main australia yah siries 1-0 se jeet letaa kyonki usne raipur main khele gaye duusare match main jeet hasil kii thi
 India probably did not approve of this
 usne apane hamale tej kar die
 It was in this battle that Akashdeep Singh gave his team a 3–2 win in the final minute, but the name of the series would be decided by a penalty shootout and Australia won it
 bharat kii ore se shootout ke dauraan jo do gol hue unamem se ek penalty stroke par hua lekin dharmaveer singh dwaara hasil duusare penalty stroke par raghunatha gol nahin kar sake
 If Raghunath had scored this goal, then both the teams would have got one chance each and in such a situation anything could have happened

 This series was very important for both the teams

 Apart from this, there is no mention of how the rich countries will fulfill their responsibility
 ection aid ke harjit singh ne kaha ki "morocco sammelan main viksit desh 2020 tak carbon utsarjan kam karne kii zimmedaari se bhaagate nazar aae hai or paris deal ke tahat jo madad di jaani he, us par amal karne ke bajaay aankadon kii baazeegari karte dikh rahe hai
 " haalanki aupchaarikta ke liye morocco main paas hue prastaav main global warming se ladane ko praathamikta dene kii baat kahi gai he or ye bhi mana gaya he ki dharti bahut tezi se garam ho rahi he, jisase halaat chintajanak bane hue hai, lekin jaankaar morocco main paas hue prastaav ko khokhla or prabhaavaheen bataa rahe hai
 Climate Action Network (south Asia) director Sanjay Vashisht told NDTV India, "all the countries in Paris came together and raised an expectation and then within a year all the countries implemented the Paris deal, in which the responsibility of all the countries was fixed
 At the same time, in Morocco's conference, developed countries are seen running away from the responsibility of financial help in fighting global warming
 " tippaniyan Vashistha told NDTV India that "in fact, the rich countries had already given more than half of the $ 100 billion in climate funds to be given by 2020 in their report even before the proposal was passed
 sachai yah he ki amir desh apni zimmedaari se bhaag rahe hai
 So far, only $ 10 billion has been promised in this fund
 america ke nae raashtrapati donald trump ke aane par to jo paisa milanaa he, us par bhi khatara mandara rahaa he
 "the idea of creating a climate fund was first introduced in 2010, under which rich and developed countries have to fund a fund to fight global warming so that developing and poor countries can find ways to create clean energy and create more carbon in space
" Not to accumulate, but the stance that rich countries have expressed in Morocco is disappointing
 bharat ke paryaavaran mantri anil madhav dave ne climet finance yani amir deshon kii ore se milane vaale paise kii kami ko lekar pehle hi apane bhaashan main chintaa jataai thi
 Apart from this, there are many issues on which the talk in this conference did not go ahead

 This debate has been going on for a long time that the impact of climate change due to carbon emissions of developed countries is increasing the devastating calamities
 isliye in deshon ko isaki zimmedaari leni chahie, lekin morocco sammelan main philhal is mudde par vaarta tal gai he
 Harjit Singh of Action Aid said that "developed countries have been running away from the responsibility of reducing carbon emissions by 2020 at the Morocco conference and are looking to juggle the data rather than implementing the help that is to be provided under the Paris deal" Huh
 " Although the proposal passed in Morocco for formalization, it has been said to give priority to fighting global warming and it is also believed that the earth is warming very fast, which makes the situation worrying, but the knowledgeable Morocco has Calling the proposal hollow and ineffective
 climet ection network (south asia) ke nideshak sanjay vashishtha ne enditivi india se kaha, "paris main saare deshon ne saath aakar ek ummid jagaai or phir saal bhar ke bheetar sabhi deshon ne paris deal ko lagu kiya, jisamen sabhi deshon kii zimmedaari tay kii gai he, vahiin morocco ke sammelan main viksit desh global warming se ladane main aarthik madad kii zimmedaari se bhaagate dikhe hai
 "comments vashishtha ne enditivi india ko bataaya ki "asal main amir deshon ne is prastaav ke paas hone se pehle hi apni report main ye kah diya ki 2020 tak climet fund main di jane vaali 100 arab dollar kii rakam kaa aadhe se adhik vah de chuke hai
 The truth is that rich countries are running away from their responsibilities
 abhi tak is fund main sirf 10 arab dollar kaa hi vaada kiya gaya he
 The money that is to be received when the new President of America Donald Trump arrives, is also under threat
 " climet fund banane kii baat 2010 main pehali baar hui, jiske tahat global warming se ladane ke liye amir or viksit deshon ko ek fund main dhan jamaa karnaa he taaki vikasshil or garib desh saaf suthri urja banane ke tareeke dhund saken or spes main or carbon jamaa na ho, lekin amir deshon ne morocco main jo rukh jataayaa he vah niraash karne vaala he
 India's environment minister Anil Madhav Dave had already expressed concern in climate speech in his speech about lack of money from rich countries
 iske alaava kai aise mudde hai, jin par is sammelan main baat aage nahin badi
 One of these is the devastating impact on the poor and developing countries from the ever increasing disasters
 ye bahes lambey samay se chal rahi he ki viksit deshon ke carbon utsarjan kii vajah se jalwaayu parivartan kaa prabhaav vinaashkari aapadaayen badha rahaa he
 So these countries should take responsibility for this, but at the moment the talks on this issue have been postponed at the Morocco conference

 railway ne is par spashtikaran dete hue kaha he ki buniyadi dhaanchon ke vistaar ke liye ‘atikaraman’ ko hataane ke liye yah karrwai jaruri thi

 Initial investigation reveals that when the child's family was preparing to move out of the slum, a pile of clothes fell on the child which led to his death, so no case is made in this regard, police said
 kejariwal ne railway par nishaanaa saadhaa he or bedakhal hue logon ke liye bhojan or aashray kii vyavastha karne main vifal rahane ke kaaran do sab-diviginal magistrate or ek anya varisht adhikari ko nilambit kar diya he
 Following the controversy, Delhi Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Arun Arora said at a press conference here that the death of the child was not related to the removal operation of encroachment that has become a 'risk' for the train's operation
 jhuggi basti suraksha jone ke 15 meter ke andar tak basii thi
 He said that the National Green Tribunal had also instructed to keep the tracks free of solid waste and ensure that the railways remove its source
