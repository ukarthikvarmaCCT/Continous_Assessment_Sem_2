 In view of the hostel problem, the students of JNUSU have been on hunger strike for 6 consecutive days, but the administration is maintaining an indifferent attitude about it
 bhukh hadtaal kar rahe students kaa aarope he ki rupee aavantit hone ke baavjood bhi tay seemaa ke andar hostel kaa nirmaan nahin ho paaya he
 The construction of a hostel on the campus named Shipra-2 has been hanging in the balance for almost two years
 chaatr sangh ke mutabik,studentske liye unhone dormetary kii jagah bhi sujhai thi, lekin prashasan ne uske liye bhi kuch nahin kiya
 For the convenience of students inside the campus, the bus was also to be run, but that too has not been completed
 jeenuasu ke vaais president anant prakaash kaa kahana he, 'prashasan ne hostel nirmaan main deree ke bare main jitani adchane bataai thim, wo sari jeenuasu ne dur kar di he
 But still the administration is not able to overcome the hostel problem

 He further said, 'the student union is not sitting on hunger strike for the first time, even before this, 9 days hunger strike has been done by the students in the month of January
 'prashasan ne dormetary ke nirmaan ke liye 10 july tak kaa samay liya tha, wo bhi biit chukaa he

 ’siem ke grih jile main bhi gadbadamukhyamantri chouhan ke grih jile sihor main prashasan ne 136 logon ko awaas kaa nirmaan nahin karne ke liye recovery notice jari kiye hai
 The administration says that these people did not get the houses constructed despite taking a sum of Rs 1
25 lakh under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 yojana ke tahat praarambhik kisht milane ke baad 68 logon ne nayaa awaas banavaane ke liye apane kachche makaan tod die
 These people have now been disqualified for the scheme
 in logon main pappu khan bhi shaamil hai
 Pappu Khan does not know that he has got the entire amount in the paper, which was fixed under the scheme
 ab suniye pappu khan kya kehete hai- ‘maine apana makaan tod kar nirmaan karana shuru kiya
 i made the construction possible from the money i was given
 mere paas paisa nahin he, ab main kaise nirmaan puraa kara saktaa he
 'yogendra Roy, Program Officer of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in Sehore, says,' 136 people have been given recovery notices because they did not build the house despite taking full money

 is yojana kaa makasad yah he ki asvachh halaat main rahane vaale logon ko svachh awaason main rahane kaa mauka mili jo unke swasthya ke liye bhi surakshit hon
 But the way the goals of the housing scheme are being met, it will bring about a change in the living conditions for the poor, there is a big question mark on this

 Congress never talked about it
 @pbhushan1 ne maujuuda chunaav ayukta par chunaav ayog kii swatantraaa ko nasht karne kaa aarope laga diya
 It is said that he was first made the Chief Secretary by Modi, then the chairman of GSPC, an organization about which the CAG has alleged the robbery of 20,000 crores
 hamaare sahyogi akhilesh sharma ne kaha ki isi chunaav ayog ne jab ahamed patel ke chunaav ke samay do maton ko avaidh ghoshit kiya tha tab chunaav ayog kii tarif hui thi
 Take care of one thing
 har faisle kii samiksha usee faisle se hogi
 If the roadshow is wrong then it cannot be right what Chawla was and AK Jyoti
 mumkin he chunaav ayog ke or faisle sahi hon, aaj bhi or ateet main bhi lekin kya rahul gandhi kaa intervyuu dena or pradhanmantri kaa road sho karnaa aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he? in donon par karrwai na kar kya chunaav ayog ek sanstha ke rup main apni saakh daanv par laga rahaa he? congress party ke netaa ne bhi pradhanmantri ke matdaan ke baad car se bheed main haath hilaate hue jane kii aalochana kii
 Randeep Surjewala and Ashok Gehlot, p Chidambaram reacted strongly
 chunaav ayog ko bhi turant saaf karnaa chahie
 If you take notice on Rahul Gandhi's interview, then you should tell whether it was a mistake or not
 yah bhi bataanaa chahie ki usee din jab rahul kaa intervyuu chalaa tab fikki ke kaarykram main shaamil ho rahe pradhanmantri kaa lanbaa bhaashan par sabhi channelon par prasaarit kiya gaya
 People will be satisfied with the Election Commission that there is a difference between the two or whether the Commission is acting on one and not on the other, then someone gave an example that the Prime Minister's advertisement was published in the newspapers of Gujarat on the day of polling and in which There was also an election symbol
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri kaa bayaan sunate hai
 Vijay Rupani said that PM showed fingerprints, did not show lotus marks
 camel kaa nishaan to pradhanmantri ne 2014 ke chunaav main matdaan ke baad dikhaaya tha
 So, according to Rupani ji, it was wrong
 chaliye agar yahi paimaana he to kya rupani ji ke anusaar unki party ke rashtriya pravaktaa sambit paatra ne aachaar samhita kaa ullaghann kiya he
 Sambit Patra tweeted in Hindi with the hashtag Gujarat with Namo that 'in the second and last phase of the election, appealed to the people of Gujarat to vote on the lotus symbol and make development victorious
 pehle matdaan phir jalpan
 ' sambit ke twit par rajdeep ne twit kiya ki chunaav ayog haazir ho
 BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav said that Congress's rope was burnt but the force did not go away
 aachaar samhita ko koun gambhirtha se letaa he, iskaa ulanghan chunaav ke samay hi than than karata he, phir kuch pataa bhi nahin chalata ki jo ulanghan tha uskaa kya hua
 But did Congress workers protest by performing at the Election Commission headquarters? The Congress workers alleged that the Election Commission was adopting a double stance
 nishpaksh tareeke se chunaav nahin karvaa rahaa he
 The Mahila Morcha of the Congress also raised slogans and demanded action against the Prime Minister and other BJP leaders who violated the code of conduct
 mahila congress kii pramukh sushmita dev is pradarshan kaa netritv kar rahi thim jo ek saansad bhi hai
 He says that the Election Commission takes action against the Congress leaders but when the turn of the BJP leaders comes, it softens
 naaraazgi or aarope lagane se aage jaakar chunaav ayog ke baahar pradarshan karnaa kya congress ne bhi seemaa nahin todi
 On December 14, BJP leaders also visited the Election Commission headquarters and met the Chief Election Commissioner
 raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman, kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad, alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantri muqataar abbaas naqvi samet kai mantri or netaa chunaav ayog ke mukhyalay gaye
 After the meeting, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that the Prime Minister did not violate any code of conduct by doing road shows
 unhone koi bayaan nahin diya
 We have never dismantled constitutional bodies
 yah road sho galat tha yaa nahin iskaa jawaab kya isse milegaa ki em es gil ko mantri banaaya gaya yaa nahin
 So it is important that the Election Commission answers

 It is possible that more decisions of the Election Commission are correct, even today and in the past, but is giving Rahul Gandhi an interview and the Prime Minister's roadshow a violation of the code of conduct?

 chunaav ayog ke prati bharosa rakhane or sammaan zaahir karne kii parampara kaa nirvaah karte hue ke je raav ne ishaare main jo baat kahi he wo mahatvapurn he
 They are saying that sometimes there is a lapse which is corrected and they are also saying that the media should not be shown
 kya media ko pradhanmantri ko road sho ke bare main nahin dikhaanaa chahie tha
 Did the Commission give such guidelines to the media before the election or during the election, or is everyone shooting arrows in the dark
 @tavleen_singh ne twit kiya ki naveen chawla mukhya chunaav ayukta banane se pehle dianasti ke nishthavan sevak the
 Chief Election Commissioner MS Gill was made a member of the Rajya Sabha and also a minister
 congress ne kabhi is par baat nahin kiya
 @ pbhushan1 accused the current Election Commissioner of destroying the independence of the Election Commission
 kaha ki unhen modi ne pehle chif secetry banaaya, phir jiespisi kaa chairman bana diya jis sanstha ke bare main sieji ne 20,000 karod kii lut kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Our colleague Akhilesh Sharma said that the Election Commission was praised when the same Election Commission declared two votes invalid during the election of Ahmed Patel
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhie
 Every decision will be reviewed with the same decision
 agar road sho galat he to isliye sahi nahin ho saktaa ki chawla kya the or e ke jyoti kya hai
 It is possible that more decisions of the Election Commission are correct, even today and in the past, but is giving Rahul Gandhi an interview and the Prime Minister's roadshow a violation of the code of conduct? By not acting on these two, is the Election Commission putting its credibility at stake as an institution? The Congress Party leader also criticized the Prime Minister for moving his car in the crowd after the vote
 randeep surajevaala or ashok gahalot, pi chidambaram ne kadi pratikriya zaahir kii
 The Election Commission should also be cleared immediately
 rahul gandhi ke intervyuu par notice liya to bataanaa chahie ki galati thi yaa nahin
 It should also be mentioned that on the same day when Rahul's interview was run, the long speech of the Prime Minister attending FICCI program was broadcast on all channels
 log chunaav ayog se hi santusht honge ki donon main kya koi antar he yaa phir ayog ek par karrwai kar rahaa he or duusare par nahin kar rahaa he, phir kisi ne udhaaharan diya ki matdaan ke din gujarat ke akhabaaron main pradhanmantri kaa vigyaapan chapa or jisamen chunaav chinh bhi tha
 Listen to the statement of the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 vijay rupani ne kaha ki piem ne ungali kaa nishaan dikhaaya, camel kaa nishaan nahin dikhaaya
 The lotus sign was shown by the Prime Minister after voting in the 2014 elections
 to kya rupani ji ke anusaar wo galat tha
 If this is the scale, then according to Rupani ji, his party's national spokesperson Sambit Patra has violated the code of conduct
 sambit paatra ne baqayada hashtag gujarat vid namo ke saath hindi main twit kiya ki 'chunaav ke duusare or antim charan ke matdaan main gujarat kii janata se apil ki ve camel ke nishaan par apana mat den evam vikaas ko vijayi banaayen
 First voting then refreshments
 ' On Sambit's tweet, Rajdeep tweeted that the Election Commission should be present
 bijepi netaa bhupendra yadav ne kaha congress kii rassi jal gai magar bal nahin gaya
 Who takes the Code of Conduct seriously, the violation of it is cool at the time of election, then nothing is known about what happened to the violation
 lekin kya congress kaaryakartaaon ne chunaav ayog mukhyalay par pradarshan kar thik kiya? congress kaaryakartaaon kaa aarope tha ki chunaav ayog doharaa ravaiya apana rahaa he
 Not conducting elections in a fair manner
 congress kii mahila morcha ne naare bhi lagaae or aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan karne vaale pradhanmantri or anya bijepi netaaon ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii
 Sushmita Dev, the head of Mahila Congress, was leading the demonstration which is also an MP
 unka kahana he ki chunaav ayog congress netaaon ke khilaaf karrwai to karata he magar bijepi netaaon kii baari aati he to naram pad jaataa he
 Going beyond protest and accusations and demonstrating outside the Election Commission, did the Congress not break the boundary
 14 disambar ko bijepi ke netaaon ne bhi chunaav ayog ke mukhyalay jatakar mukhya chunaav ayukta se mulaakaat kii
 Several ministers and leaders, including Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, visited the Election Commission headquarters
 baithak ke baad mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ne road sho kar kisi aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan nahin kiya
 He did not make any statement
 hamane kabhi bhi sanvaidhanik sansthaaon kii dhajjiyaan nahin udaayi
 Whether or not this roadshow was wrong, the answer will be whether MS Gill was made a minister or not
 isliye zaruri he ki chunaav ayog jawaab de
 Outlook and BBC Hindi have spoken to BB Sven, Gujarat's chief executive officer
 swen ne kaha he ki pradhanmantri kaa kafila jaanch ke daayre main he
 When Prime Minister Modi came out of the booth to vote, the Committee on Code of Conduct was present there, which videographed every activity
 hamane ahmedabad ke zila nirvachan padaadhikari se is bare main report maangi he
 It is too early to say that the convoy was in violation of the code of conduct
 dilli main chunaav ayog main varisht up chunaav ayukta umesh sinha ne media ko sari jaankaree di he
 He said that the Chief Election Officer of Gujarat has sent a report on all the allegations made by the Congress
 us report kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 We will consider it soon and inform
 pradhanmantri ke road sho ke vivaad kii bhi jaanch kii jaaegi
 The comments gujarat chunaavon kii taarikh ko lekar hi chunaav ayog kii bhoomika par sawaal uthne lage the
 Gujarat elections were not announced with Himachal Pradesh on 12 October
 bataaya gaya ki pehle bhi aisa ho chukaa he or baadh ke kaaran prashasan ke zarie kuch hafte kaa samay maanga gaya tha
 Then former Chief Election Commissioner SY Qureshi said that it is unfortunate not to announce elections simultaneously
 7 disambar ko gujarat hai court ne chunaav ayog ko notice jari kiya he ki vivipat kii parchi kii bhi saath-saath ginati kii jaae
 a person from Rajkot had filed a plea that since there were serious allegations about evms, slip of VVPAT along with evms should be counted
 is bare main antim jaankaree hamaare paas nahin he
 We tried to talk to several former Election Commissioners about the controversy regarding the Gujarat elections
 sabane manaa kar diya
 KJ Rao definitely spoke

 @pbhushan1 ne maujuuda chunaav ayukta par chunaav ayog kii swatantraaa ko nasht karne kaa aarope laga diya
 It is said that he was first made the Chief Secretary by Modi, then the chairman of GSPC, an organization about which the CAG has alleged the robbery of 20,000 crores
 hamaare sahyogi akhilesh sharma ne kaha ki isi chunaav ayog ne jab ahamed patel ke chunaav ke samay do maton ko avaidh ghoshit kiya tha tab chunaav ayog kii tarif hui thi
 Take care of one thing
 har faisle kii samiksha usee faisle se hogi
 If the roadshow is wrong then it cannot be right what Chawla was and AK Jyoti
 mumkin he chunaav ayog ke or faisle sahi hon, aaj bhi or ateet main bhi lekin kya rahul gandhi kaa intervyuu dena or pradhanmantri kaa road sho karnaa aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he? in donon par karrwai na kar kya chunaav ayog ek sanstha ke rup main apni saakh daanv par laga rahaa he? congress party ke netaa ne bhi pradhanmantri ke matdaan ke baad car se bheed main haath hilaate hue jane kii aalochana kii
 Randeep Surjewala and Ashok Gehlot, p Chidambaram reacted strongly
 chunaav ayog ko bhi turant saaf karnaa chahie
 If you take notice on Rahul Gandhi's interview, then you should tell whether it was a mistake or not
 yah bhi bataanaa chahie ki usee din jab rahul kaa intervyuu chalaa tab fikki ke kaarykram main shaamil ho rahe pradhanmantri kaa lanbaa bhaashan par sabhi channelon par prasaarit kiya gaya
 People will be satisfied with the Election Commission that there is a difference between the two or whether the Commission is acting on one and not on the other, then someone gave an example that the Prime Minister's advertisement was published in the newspapers of Gujarat on the day of polling and in which There was also an election symbol

 Vijay Rupani said that PM showed fingerprints, did not show lotus marks

 Sambit Patra tweeted in Hindi with the hashtag Gujarat with Namo that 'in the second and last phase of the election, appealed to the people of Gujarat to vote on the lotus symbol and make development victorious

 unka kahana he ki chunaav ayog congress netaaon ke khilaaf karrwai to karata he magar bijepi netaaon kii baari aati he to naram pad jaataa he
 Going beyond protest and accusations and demonstrating outside the Election Commission, did the Congress not break the boundary

 Several ministers and leaders, including Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, visited the Election Commission headquarters

 But did Congress workers protest by performing at the Election Commission headquarters? The Congress workers alleged that the Election Commission was adopting a double stance
 nishpaksh tareeke se chunaav nahin karvaa rahaa he
 The Mahila Morcha of the Congress also raised slogans and demanded action against the Prime Minister and other BJP leaders who violated the code of conduct
 mahila congress kii pramukh sushmita dev is pradarshan kaa netritv kar rahi thim jo ek saansad bhi hai
 He says that the Election Commission takes action against the Congress leaders but when the turn of the BJP leaders comes, it softens
 naaraazgi or aarope lagane se aage jaakar chunaav ayog ke baahar pradarshan karnaa kya congress ne bhi seemaa nahin todi
 On December 14, BJP leaders also visited the Election Commission headquarters and met the Chief Election Commissioner

 com / 2uixa8r8in — Mumbaicha Engineer (@berozgaarhoo) August 21, 2017 Let us know that this photo is one of the photoshoot during Amrita and Saif's wedding
 ab ye kapal saath nahin he or in donon kii beti sara jald hi bollywood main entry karne vaali hai
 Saif married a 12-year-old girl, kissing Amrita on the first date abhinayta leonardo dicapriyo kaa ek video saamne aayaa he, jisamen abhinayta hollywood sthit ‘ago’ naamak ek hotel se apane ‘sarvshereshth abhinayta auskar’ puraskaar ke bagaiyr hi baahar jate hue dikh rahe hai
 According to 'female First', the 41-year-old actor, who won the award at the 88th Academy Awards, was captured on camera while stepping into a car from 'ago'
 tippaniyan In this video clip, "the Revenant" actor holds a bottle of liquor in his hand and a man holding the Oscar trophy comes running to him and tries to give it to dicaprio
 vyakti unase poochta he : ‘‘kya aapako yah chahie?’’ is sawaal par abhinayta bade shant lahaze main use jawaab dete hai : ‘‘ise aap dan ko de dijie
 "dolby attended a celebration after the award ceremony was over at the theater, after which he was supposed to go to 'governors Ball' and 'vanity Fair', but before that he decided to go to Ago to celebrate with his friends
 Can convince ‘femail first’ ke anusaar, 88wein academy puraskaron main puraskaar jeetne vaale 41 varshiya abhinayta kii ‘ago’ se nikalakar ek car main jane ke dauraan kii tasviren camere main kaid ho gayi
 The comments is video clip main ‘‘da revenant’’ ke abhinayta ke haath main sharaab kii bottle he or auskar trophy pakadaa ek shaks unke paas daudte hue aata he or ise dicapriyo ko dene kii koshish karata he
 The person asks him: "do you want this?" On this question, the actor replies to him in a very calm tone: "give it to Dan
" ’’ dolbi theatre main puraskaar samaaroh khatm ho jane ke baad ek jashn main shariq hue the, jiske baad unhen ‘governors ball’ or ‘venity fere’ janaa tha, lekin isse pehle unhone ago jane kaa faisla kiya taaki vah apane doston ke saath jashn manaa saken
 In this video clip, "the Revenant" actor holds a bottle of liquor in his hand and a man holding the Oscar trophy comes running to him and tries to give it to dicaprio
 vyakti unase poochta he : ‘‘kya aapako yah chahie?’’ is sawaal par abhinayta bade shant lahaze main use jawaab dete hai : ‘‘ise aap dan ko de dijie

 Can convince chunaav kii taarikh kaa elaan hote hidilli main siyaasi halchaltej ho gai he
 BJP, AAP and Congress are creating a rapport between the public
 muqabla trikoniya he
 Every leader and party is distributing promises of gifts to woo voters
 dilli main badi taadaad daliton kii he
 This is the reason that political parties are also eyeing Dalit voters
 takreeban paune do karod kii aabaadi vaale dilli rajya main kareeb sava karod matadaata hai
 There are 25 lakh Dalits
 yani 20 fisadi
 But they affect 20 of the 70 seats in Delhi
 aise main koi bhi party inaki ahmiyat ko kam nahin aank sakati
 The BJP, which formed a majority government for the first time at the Center, has a special focus on Dalits
 bijepi ke paas dilli kaa koi damdaar dalit cheharaa nahin he, lekin party ne uttar-pashchimi dilli se saansad udit raaj ko dalit votaron ko ekajute karne kii jimmedaari di he
 In December 2014, the BJP focused on membership campaigns in Gokulpuri, Mangolpuri, Trilokpuri and Sultanpuri, keeping the Dalits in mind
 in ilaakon main 37 se 45 fisadi tak aabaadi daliton kii he
 bjp's plan does not end here
 beete saal jab oktober main swatchta abhiyaan kaa elaan kiya gaya to uskaa aagaaz piem modi ne dilli kii ek dalit basti se hi kiya tha
 And now just after the election date is announced, BJP President Amit Shah is holding a Dalit rally in Delhi
 dalit voton ko lubhaane main aam aadmi party bhi peeche nahin he
 In 2013, the AAP also captured 12 reserved seats in the Delhi Assembly
 us vakt congress kaa lagbhag sara dalit vot aap ke khate main gaya tha
 Kejriwal's strategy of cheap water and seedli came behind it
 unhone dalit bahul ilaakon main kai suvidhaayen dene kii baat kahi thi
 The party still lives up to its promise
 dilli ke slam or pichde ilaakon main rahane vaale dalit or garib log pehle din se hi aap ke saath jude rahe hai
 This time the party has given special attention to these areas in its campaign
 party ke netaa raat-din slam or jhuggiyon main rahane vaale logon ke sampark main hai
 The most important thing is that the Aam Aadmi Party has many Dalit faces from Delhi itself
 use baahar se kisi dalit netaa ko laane kii zarurat nahin he
 Congress, which has lost power in Delhi, is also ready again with hope
 party ne sabhi jatigat samikarnon ko dhyaan main rakhkar apane ummidavaaron ko chunaav maidan main utaara he
 The ala-kaman has planned to send large Dalit faces of the party to campaign in the Dalit dominated areas of Delhi
 dilli kii gaddi ko paane ke liye taiyaari to teenon partiyon ne jamkar kii he
 But for which party the Dalits of Delhi will vote, the results of the Delhi Assembly elections will have to wait
 five star hotalon ke discothek main sirf naach-gaanaa hi nahin hota balki luutane or lutane kaa jaal bhi bichaaya jaataa he
 But this crime story starts with alcohol, youthfulness and song and music and finally ends up in the grip of law
 husn or dosti ke baad vaardaat kii is daastaan main dilli police ne ek yuvati samet chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 In fact, a friend of the Delhi businessman was very expensive to find a friend in the discotheque and then meet him alone
 ladki ne pehle to use akele bulaayaa phir ek flats main le jaakar apane doston ke saath milakar uski ghadi, phone or atm card lut liya
 According to information from the police, four people, including the woman, have been arrested for allegedly robbing a businessman
 aropiyon kii pahchaan sunil kumaar gupta (23), joya (19), sunil kumaar (28) or rinku sharma (25) ke rup main hui he
 Begins to partner, Khelpolis told that Gupta came in contact with Zoya through a female friend
 vah dilli ke ek charchit disco main baraabar jaataa rahata tha
 Zoya has left school
 vah niyamit taur par disco jaati he or vahaan un logon se sampark karti he jo disco jane ke liye mahila saathi kii talash kar rahe hote hai
 After becoming a partner, Zoya befriends her by trapping her beauty and then starts the game of robbing
 kya or kaise hui lootdakshin-purv dilli ke police upayukta pi karunakaran kehete hai, 'yah ghatana ek april kii he
 The report was filed by police by Deskyang Namgyal
 unhone police ko bataaya ki hotel ashok ke discothek main vah vah ek ladki se mili, jahaan donon ne ek-duusare kaa mobile number share kiya
 The next day the girl called him to meet him at Garhi area near Neem Chowk, where the robbery was carried out
 'namagyal ne police ko bataaya ki yuvati se milane pahunche to vah unhen paas ke ek didie flats main le gai
 But as they were getting down from the car, suddenly three people came from somewhere and attacked them
 un logon ne unase ghadi, ai phone or atm card lut liya or phir ladki sahit faraar ho gaye
 Mulayam's threat, Manmohan's trust and bjp's guess
 aakhir kabatak chalegi ye sarkaar, kyonki ye to sach he ki agar mulaayam ne samarthan waapas liya to upie-2 sarkaar 14 ke bahumat se sidhe 8 ke alpamat main aa jaaegi
 But the question is whether Mulayam is ready to try this option or is he trying the opportunity as it is now? The government is elected for five years
 phiramanmohan sinhako durban se dilli lautate hi ye bataane kii jarurat kyon padi ki unki sarkaar paanch saal puure karegi
 The reason for this is the election ultimatum of Mulayam Singh, who is giving support but at the same time, he is also saying that in November, prepare for a new government
 bijepi ne badhaai sarkaar kii dhadkancongress kii dhadkan bijepi ne bhi badha di he
 She is also preparing to fight the 2014 battle in 2013 itself
 party ke pramukh pravaktaa ravishankar prasad manmohan singh kii teesri tajposhi ko adhuri mahattvakanksh kaa naam de rahe hai
 But BJP is unable to convince Sharad Yadav
 sharad yadav ne saaf kaha ki congress aise hi nahin itane saalon se sarkaar chalaa rahi he, chalaa le jaaegi
 The leaders are preparing for elections in November, but when will the government run
 ek baar phir se mulaayam singh yadav par lautie
 The leader is busy preparing for November and his Samajwadi Party spokesperson is saying that he will continue to run as it is now
 matlab jazbaat kuch, jubaan kuch
 The Samajwadi Party will not withdraw support and without it the government will not move
 congress ko phooti aankh na dekhne vaali communist party tak ko lag rahaa he ki sarkaar chalati rahegi
 If we look at the current arithmetic of the Lok Sabha, except the Speaker in the House of 542 members, then the magic figure of the majority is 271
 isamen congress kii taaqat sirf 203 kii he
 upa's own account reaches only 227, including 9 of NCP, 3 of rld's 5 National Conference and 7 others
 ab dekhie ki jab upie sirf 227 saansadon ke kunbe kaa naam he to manmohan singh kii sarkaar itane aatmavishvaas ke saath ud kaise rahi he
 We tell you how
 upi ke bharosemulaayam singh ke 22, mayawati ke 21, lalu-devgauda ke 3-3 or anya 9 saansad baahar se bahumat banaae hue hai
 This 58 parrot has the life of UPA
 or is tote kii jaan he mulaayam singh ke haath main
 When Mulayam's bicycle left the hand, the government went
 kyonki 58 se 22 jate hi udhaar kaa aankada 36 par pahunch jayega or samarthan 285 se 263 par
 Means 8 less than majority
 is aath main sarkaar kaa thaath dharaa rah jayega
 But the government is carefree and the government-run restless
 isi beficri or bechaini se ye sawaal khadaa hota he ki sarkaar kabatak

 a controversy is set to escalate amid frequent disputes in the Center's Ministry of Human Resources
 centre ke prastaavit im bill ko lekar mantralay or im ke nirdeshkon ke bich tanaav bad rahaa he
 IIM Ahmedabad director Ashish Nanda and chairman AM Nayak have openly stated that they are unhappy with this bill and if this bill is passed in Parliament, institutions like IIM will lose their reputation in the world
 aaie jaanate hai ki aakhir vivaad kya he? The Ministry of Human Resources has presented the draft Indian Institute of Management Bill, 2015 on its website
 is draft main aise kai praavdhaan hai, jinhen lekar kaaphi vivaad honevaala he
 According to these provisions, IIM boards will not only play a major role in the functioning of the institute, but the board will also have a visitor appointed by the central government, who can change the decisions of the board
 is bill ke section 35 or 36 ko dekhen to zyaadaatar faislon par centre sarkaar kii manjuuri leni jaruri hogi, jisamen fees tay karne se lekar, diarector va chairman tak ke kaarykaal par bhi centre sarkaar kaa faisla hi aakhri hoga
 The cost of building a house will also have to go to the central government, which makes the board of IIM feel that such a decision will completely undermine the autonomy of IIM
 mahatvapurn he ki im ahmedabad desh kii sabase pratishthit sansthaanon main se ek he
 It is counted among the leading management institutes around the world, in such a situation that the policies of the government can be grim if it also confronts the central government on the issue of its autonomy

 If you look at sections 35 and 36 of this bill, it will be necessary to get the approval of the central government on most decisions, in which the decision of the central government will also be the last on the tenure ranging from fixing fees, to director and chairman
 makaan banane ke liye ho rahe kharch ko lekar bhi centre sarkaar ke paas janaa padegaa, jisase im ke board ko lagata he ki is tarah ke faisle se im kii swaittata puri tarah se nestnabud ho jaaegi

 The comments philhal to ashish nanda ne kaha he ki vah maanav sansaadhan mantralay ke saath baatcheet kar rahe hai or unhen umid he ki kuch rasta nikal sakegaa
 On the other hand, information is that most IIM teachers and governing boards in the country have made up their mind to object to these provisions

 Nagpur Lok Sabha seat is in the headlines because of Nitin Gadkari

 Pitchers imported from China have blown the color of Indian companies
 vaise to ab har bhartiya tyohaar par china kii chhap rahati he, lekin holi par dragon kaa rang kuch zyada chadha dikhaai de rahaa he
 So many colorful and designer pitchers have come from China this year that domestic companies are not getting buyers
 vyapaariyon kii maane to pichakaariyon ke 90 pratishat bazaar par china kabiz he, haalanki rangon tathaa gubbaaron par abhi bhi bhartiya chhap kaayam he
 According to traders in the capital's major wholesale market, Sadar Bazar, the price of Chinese pitchers ranges from Rs 10 to Rs 2,000
 isaki tulana main bhartiya pichakaariyaan 30 se 40 pratishat mahangi pad rahi hai
 This time tanks, pumps and pressure gun pitchers have arrived from China
 holi ke utpaadon kaa kaarobaar karne vaale vasudev trading company ke indrajit khurana ne kaha, ‘‘china ne pichakaariyon main itani vairieti utaar di he ki isse bhartiya companiyon kii qamar hi tut gai he

 "china has the highest demand for tanked pitchers
" tanks vaali pichakaari main ek saath kaaphi pani aa jaataa he
 The price of this atomizer ranges from Rs 100 to Rs 400
 vahiin pressure gan pichakaari kaa daam bhi 70-80 rupee se shuru hokar 600 rupee tak he
 Such pitchers are offered in the shape of AK 47 and AK 56 rifles
 isi tarah pipe yaa pump pichakaari kaa daam to 10 rupee se shuru hokar 300 rupee tak he
 Another businessman, Pawan Aggarwal, said that domestic companies are not able to give pitchers like China at a low price, so the Chinese pitchers on Holi are increasing year after year
 agarwal ne kaha ki is baar pichakaariyon ke daam pichley saal se 10 se 15 pratishat zyada hai
 Devaraj Baweja, general secretary of the Confederation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association, says that Chinese exporters always bring something new to the market and Indian companies are unable to break it
 baveja ne kaha ki is baar holi der se padane kii vajah se china se kaaphi maal aayaa he
 The business is gaining momentum as the cold subsides
 is baar china se lanchar vaali pichakaari bhi bazaar main aa gai he
 In this atomizer, a water balloon can be hit by filling it
 bacchon main iskaa kaaphi craij dikhaai de rahaa he
 It costs Rs 1,800 to 2,000 in the wholesale market
 isi tarah aage-peeche donon ore pani kii bauchhaar karne vaali dabl trubal pichakaari bhi he
 Due to the unorganized sector, official figures on the business of Holi, color and balloons are not available on Holi
 haalanki, udyog se jude logon kaa kahana he ki deshbhar main pichakaari or rangon kaa kaarobaar 300 se 400 karod rupee rahane kii ummid he
 Of this, 80 percent is from Chinese products
 yani sirf 20 pratishat kaarobaar hi bhartiya vinirmaataaon ke hisse aayega
 Traders say that in terms of color and balloons, Chinese manufacturers are yet to establish their colors
 rangon main china se is saal sirf spray color aadi hi aaen hai
 Chinese manufacturers are far behind in making gulal etc
 khurana ke mutabik, china se aaayaatit gubbaaron kii gunvattta bhi acchhee nahin he
 Where the price of pack of 100 pieces of Chinese balloons is 4
 50 rupee se 5 rupee he, vahiin mumbai main banane vaale gubbaaron kaa daam 12 rupee packet he, iske baavjood maang bhartiya gubbaaron kii he

 ab diene test kii report kaa intazaar he
 On Wednesday, when the lid of an old septic tank was opened while building a new toilet at the MCD School in Mukhelpur village in outer Delhi, everyone lost consciousness

 It looked like 15 to 20 years old after seeing hell
 pankaj rana naam ke chashmadid ne bataaya, 'hamane jaise hi chembar ko hataaya, kriim color kii pant thi or kuch haddiyaan dikhin, phone kaa istemaal kar andar ghusaa, is said main scal giri hui thi, khopadi, saamne kuch haddiyaan or jo upar kaa hissaa tha chest or tishart wo is taraf the, kapade kaa color tha blue patta or orange patta
 ' logon ne police ko narkankal kii jaankaree di lekin isi bich is gaanv main hi rahane vaale shaukat ali bhi pahunch gaye or is tanks se 18 saal puraane ek maamle kii paraten khulne lageen

 He then went to return the bottle of cold drink to the neighborhood store

 But no clue was found
 jis skool main ye narkankal mila vahaan javed padhata bhi nahin tha, 1993 main bana ye septic tanks tab se band hi padaa he kyonki ye prayog main nahin tha
 The question is, who put the child inside by lifting such a heavy lid
 police kaa kahana he ki diene test ke baad hi saaf hoga ki narkankal javed kaa he yaa nahin
 The eyewitness named Pankaj Rana said, 'as soon as we removed the chamber, there were cream colored pants and some bones were seen, entered inside using the phone, the skull fell on the side, the skull, some bones in front and the top The part was the chest and t-shirt were on this side, the color of the fabric was blue strap and orange strap
 ' People informed the police about the hell, but in the meantime, Shaukat Ali, who lives in this village, also reached and layers of an 18-year-old case began to open from this tank
 kankal par jo kapade the unase shaukat ali ke bete ke ghar lautne kii ummid puri tarah se tut gayi
 His son Javed disappeared from home on 22 June 2000 at the age of 13 and a half
 tab wo cold drink kii bottle pados kii dukaan main waapas karne gaya tha
 The comments javed ke gaayab hone ke baad pita shaukat ne police main cese bhi darj karaayaa tha

 lekin phir koi phone nahin aayaa

 lekin uskaa koi suraag nahin mila
 Javed did not even study in the school where he got hell, this septic tank built in 1993 has remained closed since it was not in use
 sawaal ye he ki itane baari dhakkan ko uthaakar bachche ko andar kisne daalaa
 Police say that it will be clear only after DNA test whether Narkankal belongs to Javed or not

 At least 26 patients had received counseling while we were at the center
 ummid he ki ve sabhi santusht hue honge
 'health Department Principal Secretary Nitin Kulkarni had earlier informed that the facilities available in these clinics are more or less similar to' Mohalla clinics' operated in Delhi NCR
 jharkhand main isi saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 The government has started this ambitious scheme vigorously
 lekin jharkhand kii sachai ye bhi he ki yahaan marijon par doctor kaa anupaat bahut kam he

 It is not the name of a bar or pub, but rather a group of eminent people, among the most famous musicians and Rebel artists around the world who died at the age of 27
 inamen se zyaadaatar artists aise the jo satta ke khilaaf apana virodh pradarshan jataate the or mukhyadhara se alag soch rakhane vaale radical artists ke taur par pahachaane gaye
 Great filmmaker Gurudutt may have passed away at the age of 39, but he should have been included in the 27 club from the point of view because of his hard work and stubbornness amidst limited resources, in a social propaganda-ridden era, he was unimpressed by his films
 Managed to save the soul of, it is seen only in the cases of real artists
 50 kaa dashak ek aisa daur tha jab sara desh pandit nehru ke golden india ke khumaar main tha
 This was the period when the stream of nationalism was in full swing and the youth of independent country had many expectations about the new India
 inhen ummiido ko amalijama pehanaane ke liye filmon kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa tha
 Pessimism and existentialism in the new India with 'economic transformation and modernization' by Pandit Nehru's government and the expectations that arose after independence from the British was no place for cinema
 saal 1957 main ai film nayaa daur nehruvian model kaa clasik udaahan kahi ja sakati he
 The villages of this film appeared to be flourishing and full of development
 film kaa nayak garv ke saath 'ye desh he vir javaanon kaa' or 'mere desh kii dharti' gane ko gunaguna rahaa he
 The film's Modern heroine arrives in the village from the city
 ye vahi film thi jisamen pehali baar ude-ude jab julfen teri gane ke saath koi nayika khule taur par pehali baar nayak ke liye gaanaa ga rahi thi
 Everything seems happy in the village
 modern takanic ke himachati nehru or mashiinon kii khilaafat karne vaale gandhi ke bich film ne ek creative santulan bhi pradaan kiya jiskaa saar tha ki bina mashiinon ke mordan hoti duniya ke baraabar khadaa hona mushkil he jo ki kahin naa kahin nehru ke mordenigeshan se miltaa julata tha
 In the year 1960, the song 'chhoti Kal Ke Baat Kal Kal Ki Baat Purani', or the film Hum Hindustani Ka Sutal Nationalzim film ab dilli dur nahin main ek bachche dwaara apane pita ko nyaay dilaane ke liye pandit nehru ke paas tak chalane kii koshish kar di thi or us daur main kai aisi filmein ai jisane nehruvian model ko majboot karne kaa kaam kiya
 Nehru's New India was challenged by Gurudutt's cinema, however, between the mainstream and the happy cinema, Gurudutt tried to explore the picture of bright India on the cinematic screen through a dark blur
 unhone nehru ke new india ko chunauti di or cinema ke dark rup se logon ko rubaru karaayaa
 He touched on issues like poverty, unemployment, prostitution with the help of his cinema
 italian cinema main nio realist cinema kii tarj par aisi filmein banaain jo logon ko asahaj karti thi or unhen niraashaa ke anant sagar main le jaakar jhakzorti thim
 These films of Gurudutt had a tragedy filled with climax and questions related to survival
 lekin yahi filmein desh ke logon ke sapanom or ummiido ke mugalate par pani pher rahi thi jisase kadave sach ko pachaa paanaa mushkil ho rahaa tha
 Gurudutt's films were romance tragic
 samaaj or vyavastha dwaara shoshit kirdaar the, jinaki reyalti dark thi, mahatvakankshaayen keval guzaara bhar karne ke liye hi simit thi
 Clearly, the people of that era filled with expectations of new era and new India kept distance from the dark aspects of cinema and most of their films proved to be flops
 haalanki ve nehruvian daur main ek alternet cinema kii neenv rakhane main kaamyaab rahe
 Gurudutt was socially aware, and as a filmmaker, he proved to be a trendsetter on many levels
 unhone apni filmon main pratikatmakataa kaa behtareen istemaal kiya he or kahin naa kahin filmameking ko lekar us theory ko bhi apane cinema ke sahare majboot kiya tha ki filmein vijuel madhyam hoti he or expojishan yani dialogs kii madad liye bina bhi film ko kai diemension main dikhaaya ja saktaa he
 An example of this is seen in the film Pyaasa when most of the conversation between Vijay and Gulab is shown in the stairs which shows the hierarchy between them
 iske alaava unhone apni film sahib bibi or gulam main ek song main becoground dancers kathputliya yaa shadows kii tarah dikhaai dete hai
 Gurudutt used to take a special kind of closeup shot during that period, which was later called till Gurudutt shot
 in prayogon ko aaj duniya bhar kii filmon main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 As a visionary director, he knew that if the country kept running away from its shortcomings, things would go from bad to worse
 ve paaramparik madhyam se aage badhanaa pasand karte the
 In his films, the role of women was also quite challenging and he used the lights and shadows in his films wonderfully, due to which he is also called Orson Wells of India and even today many filmmakers and actors are influenced by Gurudutt
 gurudutt naa keval apni filmon balki gaanon ke sahare bhi nae navele aaazaad hue bharat main rashtrawaad kii lahar kaa counter nerrative taiyaar kar rahe the or ve us daur ke sambhraant rashtravaadiyon ko is gane ke sahare chunauti dete dikhaai de rahe the

 congress adhyaksh shrimati sonia gandhi, party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi, samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh sahit 55 saansad aise hai jinhone paanch saal ke dauraan ek bhi sawaal nahin poocha
 This report was released by Speaker of Lok Sabha Sumitra Mahajan on Thursday
 is report main loksabhaa saansadon ke paanch saal ke kaarykaal ko bahes main unki bhagidaari, sadan main upasthiti, saansad vikaas nidhi kharch karne, kaarywahi main vyavdhaan, bahirgaman or privet member bill jaise vibhinn loktantrik maapdandon kii kasuti par ksaa gaya he
 In view of the questions asked in the Lok Sabha, Anandrao Adsool of Shiv Sena stood first by asking 1,280 questions
 report ke aankade kehete hai ki lakshadweep, maharashtra, kerala, odisha, gujarat, or tamilnadu se jude saansadon ne sarvaadhik prashn puche
 There are also many interesting aspects of the Question Hour such as, according to the business, mps from industrial background asked 447 questions on average and most of the questions were asked in the Lok Sabha on the subject of finance
 railway, maanav sansaadhan, grih mantralay, swasthya or krishi par bhi sarvaadhik sawaal daage gaye jabaki saansadon kii sansadeey maamalon, antariksh, pradhanmantri karyaalay or purvottar kshetron par kaaphi kam dilchaspee dekhne ko mili
 The participation of most of the Lok Sabha mps in matters of debate in Parliament has been good
 iskaa andaaza is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 93 pratishat saansadon ne bahes main hissaa liya
 bjp's Arjun Ram Meghwal is the first in this case, while there are 35 mps who did not consider it necessary to attend the debate
 apane kshetra ke vikaas ke liye milane vaali saansad vikaas nidhi ko kharch karne main bhi tamaam bade naamon kii ruchi nahin dikhaai detii
 The negligence of mps regarding the use of MP Development Fund is not hidden from anyone anyway
 aadhe se zyada saansadon ne puri tarah se is paise kaa upyog hi nahin kiya
 Only a few mps have fully utilized this fund in the development of their region
 hamaare saansad paanch saalon main kul saansad vikaas nidhi kaa 30 fisadi bhaag hi kharch kar sake hai
 That is, after the adjournment of the 15th Lok Sabha, out of the Rs 19 crore allocated as on March 1, 2014, Sonia Gandhi only 69 percent, Rahul Gandhi 61 percent, Advani 57 percent, Mulayam Singh Yadav 76 percent, Sharad Yadav Sharad Pawar has spent 62 percent, 67 percent on the other side, Govind Chandra of Trinamool Congress, Abdul Rahman of DMK, Prem Chandra Guddu of Congress, Trinamool Kang Race Dr

 On the other hand, KP Dhanapalan of Congress is the only MP who has 100 percent attendance
 umr ke lihaaj se dekhen to 25 se 40 varsh ke saansadon kii upasthiti 67 pratishat rahi jabaki 41 se 60 varsh tathaa 60 saal se upar ke saansadon kii upasthiti kramshah 72 evam 74 pratishat rahi
 According to the business mps, mps from the film background were the worst with 57 percent attendance
 hamaare saansad loksabhaa main vyavdhaan tathaa sthagan ke liye sabase zyada jane jate hai

 The public will deny it

 " film 'parinda' kaa villen 'anna' kaa kirdaar sabko yaad hi hoga jise naanaa patekar ne nibhaayaa tha
 Anna not only gave great recognition to Nana, but this character became an iconic character of Bollywood and always will be
 magar is kahani ko shaayad hi koi jaanata hoga kii naanaa patekar film 'parinda' main anil kapur ke bade bhai kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale the
 The same role that Jackie Shroff played and won the award
 magar wo anil kapur hi the jisane naanaa patekar ko bada bhai nahin banane diya or naanaa ko anna kaa ikonic role dilvaaya
 Let me tell you that in the mind of director Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Naseeruddin Shah's name for Anil's elder brother was also in the thoughts, but Anil Kapoor brought Jackie in the role of elder brother
 ab naanaa or anil ek baar phir 'welcome back' main saath-saath aa rahe hai or is film ke prachaar ke dauraan naanaa ne khulaasa kiya or anna ke us kirdaar se judi yaadon ko or bataaya ki unhen anna banane vaale anil kapur hi the
 Laughing fun, Anil Kapoor said, 'nana and Jackie should thank me because Nana was being made my elder brother in Parinda
 ' vahiin naanaa ne bhi mazaakia lahaze main kaha, 'ye baat sahi he, us vakt anil star tha
 
 
 Because of its will, the casting was reversed, so it got me the role of Anna
 'tippaniyan Anil Kapoor praised the role and said, "no artist other than Nana Patekar can do justice to that role
 jis tarah us kirdaar ko naanaa ne nibhaayaa he mujhe nahin lagata kii naanaa se behatar koi bhi anna kii bhoomika ko nibhaa saktaa tha or main aisa film kii behatari ke liye chahta tha isliye acchhee casting chahta tha
 ' vaise puraani kahawat he ki jo hota he wo achche ke liye hota he or jo hoga wo bhi achche ke liye hi hoga
 Looking at the casting of the film Parinda, this saying proves right
 anna ke kirdaar ne naanaa ko alag pahchaan di or bade bhai ke role ne jaiki shroff ko puruskaar
 But hardly anyone knows this story that Nana Patekar was going to play Anil Kapoor's elder brother in the film 'parinda'
 vahi bhoomika jise jaiki shroff ne nibhaayaa or puraskaar hasil kiya
 But it was Anil Kapoor who did not let Nana Patekar become the elder brother and got Nana the iconic role of Anna
 aapako bataa den ki nirdeshak vidhu vinod chopra ke dimag main anil ke bade bhai ke liye nasiruddin shah kaa naam bhi vichaaron main tha magar anil kapur, jaiki ko bade bhai ke role main le aae the
 Now Nana and Anil are coming together once again in 'welcome Back' and during the promotion of the film, Nana revealed and shared more memories of Anna's character that it was Anil Kapoor who made him Anna
 hansi mazaaq ke andaaz main anil kapur ne kaha, 'naanaa or jaiki ko meraa shukriya adaa karnaa chahie kyonki naanaa ko meraa bada bhai banaaya ja rahaa tha parinda main
 At the same time, Nana also said in a funny tone, 'that's right, Anil was a star at that time
 
 
 isaki marzi se casting kaa ulat pher ho jaataa tha isliye isane mujhe anna kaa kirdaar dilvaaya
 Comments anil kapur ne us bhoomika kii taareef karte hue kaha, 'naanaa patekar ke alaava us role ke saath koi bhi kalakaar insaaf nahin kar paata
 The way Nana has played that role, i do not think that anyone could play the role of Anna better than Nana and i wanted that for the betterment of the film and hence wanted a good casting
 ' By the way, the old saying is that what happens is for good and whatever happens will be for good
 film parinda kii casting ko dekhakar ye kahawat bilkul sahi siddh hoti he
 The character of Anna gave a different identity to Nana and the role of elder brother rewarded Jackie Shroff

 However, after the criticism on the tweet, he clarified his stand
 apane bayaan ko dharmik bhaawanaaon se alag bataate hue unhone kaha tha ki vah apane bayaan par kaayam hai or unke anusaar mandiron or masjidon main laudspikar kaa prayog nahin hona chahie
 If anyone can prove that my point is anti-muslim then they are ready to apologize
 bijepi ne is baar emsidi chunaav main tay kiya tha ki kisi bhi maujuuda parshad yaa unke kareebi rishtedaar ko tikat nahin diya jayega
 This decision was taken by the party's national president Amit Shah and it is being described as the bjp's Gujarat electoral model, in which the BJP has already tried in the Municipal Corporation elections of Gujarat
 dilli bijepi kii list main party ne ye daawa bhi kiya he ki shah ke formule ko puri tarah lagu kiya gaya he
 But a BJP leader played such a game that good BJP strategists ate
 chaliye, ab aapako bataate hai ki kaise shah ke formule ko fail kiya gaya
 Actually, BJP gave ticket to Harish Sharma from Wazirpur ward
 Although Harish Sharma is brother of the incumbent councilor Poonam Bhardwaj, but he fit the formula with bjp's plea that he does not live in the same house and husband, wife, Son, daughter-in-law are out of the daughter's category
 yahaan bhi thik tha, lekin khel to kahin or hona tha
 The nomination was filed by Harish Sharma, but when the nomination was scrutinized, the nomination of this candidate from Wazirpur ward was rejected due to technical flaws, now according to the rule the covering candidate is the official candidate of the party, if his nomination is found to be correct
 
 dilachasp baat ye he ki is seat se kavring candidate suresh bharadwaj the, jo ki bijepi ke purv parshad hai or 2007 main bijepi ke tikat par jite the
 In 2012, when the seat was reserved for women, she gave her ticket to her daughter-in-law Poonam Bhardwaj, who also won and the sitting councilor is also present, but now that bjp's official candidate form has been rejected, then Suresh Bhardwaj BJP Became a candidate for
 matlab bahu kii seat par ab sasur bijepi ke tikat par chunaav ladenge
 According to party sources, the whole game of rejecting the official candidate form of BJP was already decided
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ummidavaar ke parche main jaanboojhkar kami chodi gai, taaki kavring candidet ko aadhikarik ummidavaar banaaya ja sake
 Interestingly, Suresh Bhardwaj left the BJP and joined the AAP in the 2015 assembly elections and the AAP had made him its candidate but the BJP had convinced its leader and Bhardwaj returned the Aam Aadmi Party ticket
 And had joined BJP again
 lekin is baar shah kaa formula unke tikat kii raah main roda ban gaya

 No one can tell when an earthquake will occur, but everyone knows that there will be an earthquake in the Himalayan region
 vaigyanikon ke mutabik qareeb pachaas karod saal pehle dharti do bade mahadwipon main banty hui thi
 
 
 Eurasia and Gondwana Land
 dharti ke vikaas kram main gondvanaa land kai tukdon main tuutakar alag-alag dishaao kii ore badha
 a part of it which became the Indian subcontinent collided with the Eurasian Plate
 donon platon ke bich isi takkar or ragad se bani silavaton se himalay bana he
 The Indian plate is still under pressure on the Eurasian plate at the rate of five centimeters per year, or rather, sliding under it
 donon platon ke bich bad rahe is dabaav main chuphi urja rah rahakar jab release hoti he to yahaan bukamp aate hai
 There have been earthquakes of around eight magnitude in this Himalayan region
 jaise 1905 main kangra, 1934 main bihar-nepal border, 1897 main shilong or 1950 main assam
 But the red streak that you are seeing in this graphics, there has not been an earthquake of magnitude eight in the last two hundred years
 isi lakeer ke purvi chor par haal main bukamp aayaa he
 According to geologists, this red streak, called the Central Psychological Gap, is prone to a large earthquake because there is a lot of pressure below the ground and its energy can take the shape of an earthquake at any time
 is laal lakeer yani central sizmik gap se hindustan kaa bada hissaa laga hua he
 The Himalayan region is an active zone, but Gondwana is six hundred million years old, which is the most stable and permanent land plot in the world

 At present, all of us are stuck in the Himalayan and Eurasia Plate push

 lekin is graphix main jo aap laal lakeer dekh rahe hai vahaan aath kii tivrata kaa bukamp beete qareeb do sau saal main nahin aayaa he
 a recent earthquake has occurred at the eastern end of this line
 bhuvaigyanikon ke mutabik is laal lakeer jise central sizmik gap kehete hai us par bada bukamp aane kii ashanka lagaataar bani hui he kyonki yahaan zamin ke neeche kaafii dabaav bana hua he or isaki urja kabhi bhi kisi bukamp kii shakl le sakati he
 a large part of India is covered by this red streak, ie the Central Scientific Gap
 himalay kaa ilaaka to sakriy zone he lekin gondvanaa to saath karod saal purana he, jo duniya kaa sabase sthir or sthaayee bhukhand he vahaan bhi bhuncup aa gaya
 The earthquakes in Koyna and Latur in Maharashtra shocked everyone
 philhal himalay or uresia plate kii dhakka mukki main ham sabaki jaan ataki hui he
 The house of our dreams hangs
 har bukamp ke baad ham sab apane hi ghar main beghar mahasoos karne lagate hai
 The roof of the house which we feel safe is deadly these days
 aap pichley do teen dinon se akhabaaron main pard rahe hai ki purvi se uttar bharat ke bade hisse ko sismik zone chaar or paanch main baanta gaya he
 The area where your anchor lives and another panelist of today does not know who trusts
 pichley do dinon se jis kisi ko dekh rahaa hum wo apane flats ko shaq kii nazar se dekh rahaa he
 Experts say that if an earthquake strikes, it should be seated at the corner of walls inside the house
 sar jhukaa liya jaae or mumkin ho to kisi chiz se dhank liya jaae
 It is also advisable to sit under the table, but when you looked at your table, it felt that it could barely handle the crockery, it would be further subdued by concrete
 lihaaza kone or teble ko chhod aapkaa yah ankar lift kii taraf bhaaga, jab khyaal aayaa ki lift khatarnaak he to sidhiyon se utarane laga
 Repeated this mistake twice
 baahar nikal kar dekha to main akelaa nahin tha
 Like me, most people did the same thing
 tippaniyan If this is an earthquake affected area then we need to be educated again and again
 sirf oonchi imaaraton kii baat nahin he, gali mohalle or dukaanon kii imaaraten bhi surakshit hai yaa nahin, kisi guideline ke aadhaar par banati hai yaa nahin yah sab lagaataar jaanane or dekhne kii zarurat he
 Twenty percent of the world's earthquakes occur in Japan
 yahaan bukamp kii tivrata 6 yaa usase zyada hoti he
 In total, there are more than 2000 tremors every year
 2011 ke bukamp or tsunami main vahaan 18000 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Fewer people died due to the earthquake
 tsunami se zyada
 Japan buildings are considered the best in terms of anti-earthquake technology
 japani imaaraton kii neenv kaaphi gahari hoti he, shock abzarwar lage hote hai
 Buildings move along the earth so they avoid falling
 har skool ke bachche ko pataa hota he ki dharti hilne par kya karnaa he
 There is a drill in the school every month
 japan ne 1995 ke bukamp ke baad kaaphi kuch niyam banaae or apana tarika badla he
 As a civil society, how Indians behave differently from Japanese
 japani system kya he
 This is also talked about in prime time
 bharat kii sansad ne nepal ke shok ke saath apni samvednaa jataai he or sabhi dalon ke saansadon ne tay kiya he ki ve apana ek maheene kaa vetan nepal or bharat main punarvaas kaam ke liye denge
 The mps whom we have been criticizing day and night have also come forward

 Is the reason for the delay in the duly announced seat sharing in Bihar waiting for NDA leaders to accompany Upendra Kushwaha's RJD? bihar main janata dal united, bhaajapa or ramvilas paswan kii lok janashakti ke bich agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav ke liye siton ke talmail par baatcheet puri ho chuki he
 However, the leader of any party is not speaking openly about the number of seats
 lekin iske bare main pehali baar janata dal united ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar ne apni party kii rajya kaaryakarini kii baithak main khulkar sanket diya
 Nitish Kumar had said in front of about 260 leaders of his party that i have already spoken to the BJP national president, the seats have been divided
 siton kii sankhya bhale nitish ne nahin bataai lekin kaha ki sammanjanak sankhya he
 Although jokingly said in this meeting that 'I will not say the number yet, it will be announced separately
 tyaagi ji yahaan baithe hai isliye yahaan nahin boluungaa nahin to media ko bol denge
 ' lekin wo chaahe janata dal united ke netaa hon yaa bhaajapa ke, sab maan rahe hai ki agar nitish bol rahe hai to ve bina kisi aadhaar ke nahin bolenge
 He is not a talkative leader
 lekin jaankaar bataate hai ki jab bhi siton ko sankhya kii ghoshnaa hogi ve bhaajapa jiske vartmaan main 22 saansad hai or janata dal united jiske do, unke bich ek do siton se zyaada kaa antar nahin hoga
 But the hurdle in this announcement right now is about Upendra Kushwaha as to what his stand will be
 tippaniyan Bihar BJP leaders are assuming that when Nitish Kumar is with them, then Upendra Kushwaha even goes with RJD, then it will not have any adverse effect on NDA
 iske peeche unka tark he bihar vidhansabha kaa pichhlaa chunaav kaa parinaam, jahaan is baat kaa koi aadhaar nahin dikhaa jisase kushvaha votaron par upendra kii pakad dikhe
 Therefore, if they leave, both Nitish and BJP are confident about it and want to announce it duly soon
 isliye nitish ne apane pravaktaaon ko ab unke bayanon ko notice na lene kii salaah ye kehete hue di he ki unka aglaa kadam kya hoga mujhe andaaza he
 Kushwaha knows that the current NDA did not need him, but he does not want to leave the post in a hurry and the RJD has a problem
 jin siton par upendra nazar lagaae hai ve tejasvi yadav ke nazadiiki netaa jaise alok mehta kii puraani jiti seat hai
 Negotiations have been completed between the Janata Dal United, BJP and Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti in Bihar for the next year's Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki siton kii sankhya ke bare main kisi dal kaa netaa khulkar nahin bol rahaa
 But for the first time, Janata Dal United national president Nitish Kumar gave an open signal in his party's state executive meeting
 nitish kumaar ne apni party ke kareeb 260 netaaon ke saamne bolaa tha ki meri bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh se baat ho chuki he siton kaa bantwaaraa ho chukaa he
 Though Nitish did not give the number of seats, he said that the number is respectable
 haalanki is baithak main majaak karte hue kaha tha ki 'abhi main sankhya nahin boluungaa, alag se uski ghoshnaa hogi
 Tyagi ji is sitting here so i will not speak here, otherwise i will speak to the media
 ' But whether they are leaders of Janata Dal United or BJP, everyone is assuming that if Nitish is speaking then he will not speak without any basis
 ve halki-phulki baat karne vaale netaa nahin hai
 But experts say that whenever the number of seats will be announced, the BJP, which currently has 22 mps and the Janata Dal United whose two, will not have more than a difference of two seats between them
 lekin philhal is ghoshnaa main aadchan upendra kushvaha ko lekar he ki unka kya rukh hoga
 The comments bihar bhaajapa ke netaa maanakar chal rahe hai ki ab jab unke saath nitish kumaar hai tab upendra kushvaha rajd ke saath chale bhi jate hai to uskaa endie ke upar koi pratikul asar nahin padegaa
 Their reasoning behind this is the result of the last election of Bihar Legislative Assembly, where there is no basis to show that Upendra's hold on the Kushwaha voters
 isliye agar ve chale jaaenge jisko lekar nitish or bhaajapa dono aashwast hai or chaahate hai ki isaki vidhivat ghoshnaa ve jald karen
 That is why Nitish has advised his spokespersons not to take notice of his statements anymore, saying that i know what his next step will be
 vahiin kushvaha ko maaloom he ki vartmaan endie ko unki zarurat nahin rahi lekin ve jaldibaji main mantri pad nahin chhodana chaahate or rajd main dikkat he
 The seats that Upendra has been eyeing are old seats won by leaders close to Tejashwi Yadav such as Alok Mehta
 lekin wo chaahe janata dal united ke netaa hon yaa bhaajapa ke, sab maan rahe hai ki agar nitish bol rahe hai to ve bina kisi aadhaar ke nahin bolenge
 He is not a talkative leader
 lekin jaankaar bataate hai ki jab bhi siton ko sankhya kii ghoshnaa hogi ve bhaajapa jiske vartmaan main 22 saansad hai or janata dal united jiske do, unke bich ek do siton se zyaada kaa antar nahin hoga
 But the hurdle in this announcement right now is about Upendra Kushwaha as to what his stand will be

 vaise to wahidaa is bechaini ko sweekaar karti hai, lekin aaj 60 saal baad bhi unke jawaab paraton main lipte hue hai
 That day Guru Dutt ji was sitting in a distributor's office in Hyderabad, when he heard some noise outside
 guru dutt ji ne poocha ki sadak par bavaal kyon ho rahaa he to unhen bataaya gaya ki ek lokapriy telegu film ke sitare vahaan se guzar rahe hai or unke utsaahi prashansak shor machaa rahe hai
 The distributor then said, "A song has been shot on a new girl in the film
 us ladki ne tahalaka machaa diya he
 Whenever the stars go to any stage, the audience is excited to see that girl
 uskaa naam wahidaa rahamaan he
 Guru Dutt ji asked surprised, "waheeda Rehman? This is a Muslim name
 kya vah urdu bolti he?” jawaab mila, “suna he ki vah telegu or tamil bhi bolti he
 "then Guru Dutt ji told the distributor that he would like to meet me because he is looking for new actors for his film
 distributor ne prasad ji se mulaakaat tay karne ke liye sampark kiya
 Prasad ji had not heard the name of Guru Dutt ji till then
 50 ke dashak ke madhya main dakshin bharat main bahut kam log unke bare main jaanate the
 Probably there were not many film magazines in those days and my family and i did not even read all that
 isliye hamane unka naam nahin suna tha
 The distributor told Prasad ji that his friend is a famous director of Bombay and has made many successful films
 prasad ji ne meri maa se sampark kiya or hamen bataaya ki guru dutt ji mujhase milanaa chaahate hai
 My mother and i arrived at the distributor's office the next day
 mere khyaal se yah mulaakaat kareeb aadha ghanta chali hogi
 Guru Dutt ji hardly said anything
 unhone hamase hindi main kuch sawaal kiye, jaise ham kahaan ke rahane vaale hai
 All this happened
 ham apane hotel laut aae, jahaan ham tehre hue the
 When Prasad ji asked how was the meeting, my mother replied that Guru Dutt ji spoke very little
 prasad ji bole ki kuch log aisi hi mitti ke bane hote hai
 a few days later we returned to our home in Madras
 unhone meri film nahin dekhi thi
 He did not know what i look like on camera
 unhone bas meraa naam suna or mujhe dekhe bina hi milane ke liye bulavaa liya
 Now why would any distributor even mention my name? There was no reason for this
 phir mujhe kaise yah yakeen na ho ki meri kismat main yah likhaa tha?hyderabad main hamaari pehali mulaakaat ke baad teen maheene guzar gaye
 Then one day someone came to visit our house in Madras
 usne kaha ki vah bombai se aayaa he
 i thought there was a film distributor
 usne bataaya ki vah usee diarector kii taraf se aayaa he, jisase ham hyderabad main mili the
 In fact, by that time, we had forgotten the name of Guru Dutt
 is par hamaare mehmaan ne kaha, “dekhie, guru dutt ne mujhase kaha he ki main aapako apane saath bombai le jaaun
 They want to sign you
 ” meri maa bahut hairaan thim
 He considered it appropriate to seek the opinion of friends about it
 doston ne salaah di ki bismillah karo or jaao
 She was very hesitant
 bombai hamaare liye videsh se kam nahin tha
 As usual he asked Prasad ji for advice and he replied, "go on Mrs
 Rahman, there is no harm in her working in Bombay
" par yaad rakhie ki yah kisi kii gulam nahin he
 Do not accept everything
 agar koi baat manamafik na lage to kah dijiega
 If you don't like being there, you will come back
 darane kii jarurat nahin he
 "so three of us, my mother, a friend of the family, Mr
 Lingam and I, reached Bombay in late 1955
 ham charchget par ritz hotel main tehre the
 There was no audition or camera test
 bas unhone kuch photo khinche or phir contract sin karne kaa vakt aa gaya
 The meeting was held in the office of Guru Dutt Ji on the first floor of Famous Studio in Mahalakshmi, in which many people were present
 sabase pehali baat raaj khosla ne kahi ki meraa naam bahut lanbaa he
 It will have to change
 maine kaha, “mere mata-pita ne yah naam diya he or mujhe apana naam pasand he
 i will not change it
 ” ekadam sannata chaa gaya
 Raj Khosla was completely upset
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki kahaan se mujhamen itani himmat ai
 But i did not stop saying that
 maine yah bhi kah diya, “maine telegu or do tamil filmein kii hai or mujhe apana naam nahin badalanaa padaa
 i have not run away from home nor hiding from my family
 meri maa yahaan saamne baithi hai
 i see no reason why i should change my name
 ” guru dutt ji kii ek aadat thi ki ve kuhaniyaan mej par tikaakar or apni thodi ko donon haathon se pakadakar baithte the
 They kept listening quietly
 mujhase kaha gaya ki unhen sochane ke liye vakt chahie
 We stayed in Bombay for over a week because the talk about my name got stuck
 mujhe us din kii ek-ek baat yaad he
 Guru Dutt ji sat silently, did not say a word, but Raj Khosla kept jumping on his chair
 aakhirkaar agali mulaakaat main tay ho gaya ki main apane naam se hi kaam kar sakati hum
 i was under 18, so they asked my mother to sign the contract
 lekin isse pehle ki maa kaagaj par kalam tikaatin, main bol padi, “main contract main kuch jodpha chaahati hum
 "raj Khosla said with astonishment," New people generally do not keep demands, you sign
 ” guru dutt ji chup rahe
 Then i told him that if i do not like any costume, i will not wear it
 guru dutt ji kursi se uth gaye
 Then said in a calm voice, "I don't make such films
 tumne meri koi film dekhi he?” “nahin
 " "alright then
 shahar main mistar and misses 55 chal rahi he
 Go see and come
 costum ke bare main ham baad main baat karenge
 "we were given a ticket to the cinema and we went to see Mr
 and Mrs
 55
 agle din ham phir offis pahunche or hamane kaha ki film ke costum main to koi dikkat nahin thi
 But despite this, i wanted the condition condition to be added
 raaj khosla ne guru dutt ji kii taraf dekha or phir bole, “ajeeb baat he guru, tum is ladki kii baaten sune ja rahe ho or kuch bolte nahin
 Costumes are chosen according to the scene, not according to the actress
 ”mujhe yakeen nahin hota ki main itani badboli thi, par us din main ad gai, “jab badi ho jaaoongi to ho saktaa he ki swimasoot pahan luun par abhi nahin, kyonki mujhe bahut shame aati he
 "raj Khosla replied," If you feel so ashamed, why do you want to work in films? " i calmly replied, "I have not come here by myself
 aapane hamen bulaayaa he
 "there was no decision
 hamen car se ritz hotel chhudvaa diya gaya
 The next day we reached office again
 meri costum vaali shart jodi gai or meri maa ne guru dutt films ke saath mere teen saal ke contract par sin kar die
 i was only 18 when we were making thirsty
 main ek insaan ke taur par guru dutt ji ko pard nahin saki
 This was my second Hindi film and i used to be immersed in my work all the time
 lekin ve bahut chupchaap rahete the or hameshaa filmon ke bare main sochate the
 Sometimes they would ask me if i had read such and such book, on which they wanted to make a film
 jab main unke saath baithi hoti or koi teesraa aadmi aasapaas ho or ham baat karne lagate to hamen pataa lag jaataa tha ki guru dutt ji hamaari baaten nahin sun rahe hai
 He was always lost in his thoughts
 jab ham unki taraf palatate to ve yah bhi bhul jate the ki baatcheet kahaan se shuru hui thi
 If someone could see it in their eyes, they would often find that they were not present there
 agar koi mujhase puche ki unhen duniya main sabase zyada kya pasand tha to vah tha unka kaam
 Everyone makes films that are not very successful
 unki bahan laali (lalita laazmi) ne ek baar mujhe bataaya ki guru dutt ji depressant main the
 In the last years of his life, he used to be very confused
 ham sab unki uljhan dekh paa rahe the
 He was unhappy, but none of us could understand how deep he was in depression
 unhone raaj film shuru kii, jisamen mere saath sunil dutt the
 i did many good scenes, but Guru Dutt ji stopped that film
 jab hamane kaaran poocha to bole, “jam nahin rahaa he
 "he then started the film Gauri with Geeta
 gita acting karnaa chaahati thim, lekin guru dutt ji ne use bhi bich main hi chhod diya
 My husband was also in depression and we could not understand this
 ve apane aasapaas kii har cheez main dilchaspee khone lage the
 They did not want to meet people
 darasal unamem kuch bhi karne kii ichha baaki nahin rahi thi
 In the same way nobody could understand what Guru Dutt ji was feeling
 unki maut ek rahasy thi
 Nobody was able to say for sure whether it was a suicide or an accident
 sab jaananaa chaahate the
 His death was a shock to us all
 ve sirf 39 saal ke the
 Was still young
 sabaki jabaan par ek hi sawaal tha, “unki maut aise kyon hui?” mere filmi saathiyon main se kisi ne kabhi hamaare rishte ke bare main koi nijee sawaal nahin poocha
 Always other people and media people were desperate to know this and today even after 60 years we want to know about our relationship
 main maanati hum ki ham public figure hai, par meraa yakeenan yah bhi maananaa he ki meri nijee jindagi nijee hi rahani chahie
 The world should only be concerned with what work we leave behind
 mere pati shashi rekhi se meri mulaakaat film shagun ke set par hui thi
 Initially i used to call him by his film name Kamaljeet and sometimes just called Kamal
 lekin jab zyada jaan-pahchaan ho gai to unka asli naam shashi lene lagi
 He was not very popular and was also new in the film world
 1960 ke dashak tak meri haisiyat aisi ho gai thi ki main nae kalakaaron kii madad karne lagi or nae actors or diarectors ke saath kaam karne ke liye taiyaar rahati thi
 Kamal was very shy and quiet
 shagun ke dauraan hi mujhe lagane laga tha ki ve mujhe pasand karte the par unhone kaha kuch nahin
 On Eid they sent me a big box of chocolates
 meri bahanen or unke bachche us vakt mere saath hi rahete the
 Seeing the box of chocolates, i said, "what a nice man to send chocolates to us
 ” meri bahan saidaa ne meri taraf ghurkar dekha or boli, “are bevakoof! ye hamaare liye nahin, tere liye he
 Shagun did not work at the box office
 kamaljit ne filmon main kaam karnaa band kar diya
 He settled in Toronto and opened a few shops there
 ve jab bhi bombai aate the to apane kaaphi kareebi dost yash or hiru johar ke paas thaharte the
 They were also close friends of mine, so often all three used to come to me
 1972 kii baat he
 i said that i also want to open an Indian restaurant in Paris
 is par shashi ne kaha, “are meraa partner or main san diego main restaraan kholane vaale hai to kyon na ham milakar yah kaam karen?” kuch din baad shashi kaa phone aayaa or ve bole, “main tumse kuch baat karnaa chahta hum
 Can i come over i thought they liked me a lot, but i thought they would like to talk about putting money in restaurants
 ham coffee pi rahe the, tabhi achaanak shashi ne kaha, “main tumse shaadi karnaa chahta hum
 Will you marry me? ”I was completely shocked
 kya maine sahi suna tha? maine nazren jhukaa leen
 i could not understand what to say
 ve ek minute tak chup rahe or phir bole, “maine tumse kuch poocha he, tumne jawaab nahin diya
 "I just said that i need time to think
 sabaki jindagi main ek vakt aata he, jab ham ghar basaane or bacchon ke bare main sochate hai
 i was 34 years old and frankly, my career was not even at that high now because Hindi cinema does not have good roles for women above 30 anyway
 main shaadi karnaa chaahati thi
 So started thinking on his proposal
