 ' After the Delhi election results, Arvind Kejriwal advised the common man party workers to avoid arrogance
 tab unhone congress or bijepi kii misaal dete hue kaha tha ki ahankaar ne donon ko kis tarah barbaad kar diya, sab dekh rahe hai
 What did Kejriwal mean by egotism? What kind of arrogance was he talking about? Are they able to save themselves from the shadow of ego? In a tweet, AAP leader Ashutosh described the party's fight as a struggle of ideas
 kya vichaaron ke sangharsh or varchasv kii ladaai main koi fark nahin hota?kaisaa loktantr, kitni paardarshita?kehane ko to aam aadmi party aantarik loktantr se lekar lokapal or kaamkaaj main paardarshita kii baat jor shor se uthaati or prachaarit karti rahi he
 But are there more teeth to eat and more to eat? Are these things just to enhance the speech of the spokespersons on TV? What is the meaning of how Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan were removed from the party's most important PAC? After all, voices of protest were raised about the fact that a man should not remain in two positions
 len-dein ke saath kharchon ke maamle main bhi paardarshita laai jaae
 Voting was held on the matter with 11 votes in favor and eight in opposition
 yani ye aath sadsy ve the jo maanate hai ki yogendra or prashanth kii baaten sahi hai
 Was the crime of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan so big, whose punishment could not be less? Will the opinion of those eight people change after this decision? Ekla Chalo Re or something
 
 
 kejariwal ab tak kamyaabi ke raste par badhate chale hai, bhale hi unke saathi peeche chhot jate hai
 Even before the Anna movement reached Ramlila Maidan, many social activists like Rajendra Singh and PV Rajagopal were separated from the path
 in logon kaa kahana tha ki kejariwal kisi kii baat nahin sunate, sirf man kii karte hai
 The reason for the separation of Anna Hazare and Kejriwal was also the reason that Kejriwal was talking about forming a party and Anna wanted to be limited to the movement only
 kejariwal apane raste par badhate gaye, anna peeche chhot gaye
 Yes, the ritual is definitely paid when you meet
 kiran bedi bhi bijepi jwine karne se kaaphi pehle kejariwal kaa saath chhod chuki thim
 Justice Santosh Hegde had already opted out
 kejariwal ke shuruaati andolan main saath raheen aruna raay se bhi matbhed ke kuch aise hi kaaran bataae jate hai
 Did Kejriwal really stay away? Was there no consensus between Arvind Kejriwal in terms of shortening the height of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan? Several days after the uproar within AAP, a day before the party's national executive meeting, Kejriwal tweeted and expressed regret that he was unhappy about what was going on in the party
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki wo is maamle main nahin padenge
 Coincidentally, something happened that due to ill health, he could not even reach the executive meeting
 takneekee taur par is karrwai main kejariwal kii koi bhoomika nahin maani ja sakati, lekin kya isamen unki koi sahmati nahin thi
 Did Kejriwal, rather than Kejriwal, have a problem with the voice of opposition? Kejriwal has come into politics through the movement
 kejariwal kii ladaai system se thi
 They are now part of the system
 andolan virodh kaa swar buland karata he
 Is Kejriwal no longer tolerating voices of protest? kejariwal virodh karen to sahi, unke saathi virodh jataaen to galat
 What kind of democracy is this? As the Chief Minister of Delhi, Kejriwal had staged a sit-in protest and protested against some policemen
 ab unke rangarut unheen ke varisht saathiyon dhakka dekar daravaaje se baahar nikaal rahe hai - or wo chup hai
 Whatever the meaning of Kejriwal's ego line, the results are no different
 maafee or bhul sudhaar kii gunjaaish hameshaa nahin bani rahati

 com / ijqol8thul Ginni Mahi, 20 years old, singer, activist, Jalandhar, Punjab After crossing many narrow streets of Jalandhar (old), when we reached her house, she was looking at the cemented roof of her house and looked towards the city
 ve kahati hai ki jab main apane geeton kii lokapriyata ke bare main sochati hum to, kai baar yakeen nahin hota
 Ginni Mahi, who belongs to the Jatav community of Punjab, says, "I sing what i have felt very strongly about
 mere andar kabhi yah laalasaa nahin rahi ki log mujhe star kahkar bulaaen
 "while most Punjabi contemporary music on one hand revolves entirely around the stories of" Jat "gaurav and his" bravery ", Mahi's lyrics take seriously the larger social themes of equality in the struggle of everyday life, women's empowerment
 Are drawn from maahi jor dekar kahati hai, "beshak main daliton ke saath hone vaale bhedbhaav par jor detii hum, lekin sabko saath lekar chalane kaa bhav mere geeton kaa anivaary hissaa he
 This is what helps me reach a large audience
 '' maahi aaj na keval bharat main hi balki yunaan, germany, canada or england jaise deshon sahit duniyabar main apana parformens de rahi hai
 Mahi's father social worker Rakesh Chander has played an important role in giving direction to Mahi's life
 unhone apni beti main sangeet ke prati vishesh rujhaan ko choti umr main hi bhaanp liya tha
 Rakesh says, "whenever radio or television was on, she used to rum
 hamen shuru se hi lag gaya tha ki hamaari beti khaas he
 Singles such as Danger Chamar, Haq, Fan Baba Sahib Di, Ki Hoya Jay Main Dhi Hai, besides two albums, Guran Di Deewani (2015) and Gurupurb Hai Kanshi Wale Da (2016) are his big hits
 apane shahar ke hansraj mahila mahavidhyalay se snaatak maahi is baat se ittefaq nahin rakhti ki log punjabi geeton main keval dance number ko hi pasand karte hai
 Mahi says, "socially relevant songs have always resonated the strings of people's minds
 '' maatr aath saal kii choti umr se live sho karne vaali yuva gayika kaa sapana, hindi film udyog main becoground singer banane or sangeet main doctoret kii degree hasil karne kaa he
 Baat Pate Ki: Most of his songs, especially Fan Baba Sahib Di and Raj Baba Sahib Da, have created a storm on social media with over 13 lakh and 12 lakh hits respectively
 *** Internet search engine Google has made its much hyped social networking service 'google Plus' available to all

 Till now the service was available on invitation only as a trial
 iske anusaar beete 12 hafton main company ne pareekshan kiye hai or bahut kuch puraa kar liya gaya he
 But based on the improvements so far, the company is offering a beta version

 Despite being one of the strongest parties in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, Mayawati finally said that if she did not get a clear majority after the election, she would prefer to sit in the opposition and not form a government in alliance with any political party
 satta ke pramukh daavedaaron main or koi party aisa bayaan detii nazar nahin aa rahi he
 Be it BJP or sp-congress alliance, no one is willing to say anything less than two-thirds majority
 mayawatishayad akeli netaa hai jo aise samay main yah jokhim le rahi hai jab chah charnon main 330 siton kaa matdaan bachaa hua he
 Mayawati said- It was not acceptable to sit in the opposition but never with the BJP
 When the first phase of voting was completed last week, BJP President Amit Shah had reiterated the statement of claim on power and said that he is facing the BSP in the first and second phase and the rest
 From the alliance of Samajwadi Party and Congress in five phases of
 aisa kehane ke peeche darasal manshaa yah thi ki bhaajapa virdohi vot bante or jeet ke liye do dhadon ke bich takaraav tindhruviya ban jaae
 BJP can benefit from this
 kisi ek party yaa gathbandhan ke saath takaraav bhaajapa virdohi maton ko lamaband karegaa
 But at the root of this statement, there is also competition to say that you are stronger than others
 mayawati ke liye yah bahut aavashyak he ki wo logon ko bataaen ki wo majboot hai or unamem vishwaas karke log basapa ko vot den
 In order for Mayawati to establish such a thing, it is first important that she can keep her election equation tied
 mayawati kaa daanv isbaar dalit-muslim sameekaran par he or isamen unhen send lagati nazar aa rahi he
 Among the Muslim voters, the SP is still getting more priority than the BSP
 uski vajah he mayawati kaa bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhanon kaa itihaas
 If the Muslim voter feels that there is a shortage of seats, Mayawati should not form a government with the BJP again
 aisa hua to wo thage jaaenge or isiilie wo is sthiti se bachane ke liye sapa ko shaayad pehali praathamikta de rahe hai
 If Mayawati only continues to win, then the Muslim vote will slip inside and the situation will become difficult for them
 aise main unhen tatkaal yah samajhane kii zarurat he ki wo kisi bhi haal main bhaajapa ke saath nahin jaaengi
 Not a compromise with the BJP, even if it has to sit in the opposition, such a statement is actually Mayawati's message to the Muslim voters of the state so that they can overcome doubts and fears and vote for them
 aisa agar ho paata he to ek nakaaratmak dikhne vaala bayaan mayawati ke liye ek sakaaratmak tasviir taiyaar kar saktaa he
 It is obvious that Mayawati's opponents will act to show this statement as a confession of her defeat
 lekin vipaksh ke is hamale se mayawati kamazor kam, patibaddh zyaada nazar aaengi
 The assembly election of this bar in the state is crucial for Mayawati
 unki party, unka netritv or desh main dalit raajnneeti ke varchasv kii drushti se mayawati ke liye yah chunaav jeetna bahut zaruri he
 Mayawati understands this very well
 or shaayad isiilie vipaksh main baithne kii baat kahkar unhen ek bada daanv khelaa he
 However, how much Muslims obey his statement, it will be decided only after counting of votes on March 11

 vishesh cell ne tunda ko 16 agast 2013 ko bharat-nepal seemaa se giraftaar kiya tha
 During the arguments on the allegations, advocate MS Khan, appearing for Tunda, argued that there was no evidence in the case and the confessions of the other accused arrested in the case could not be grounded against his client
 khan ne yah bhi kaha ki tunda ko visphotak saamagree kii kathith baramadagi se jodne ke liye koi saamagree nahin he
 Public prosecutor Rajiv Mohan had argued that the statement of the other co-accused who had been convicted in the case related to the provisions of the Explosive Substances Act was about to be disclosed

 The results of the panchayat elections are coming in Rajasthan, but one thing is clear that if the BJP has improved its mathematics in the district councils and panchayat committees as compared to 2010, then the Congress has given them a good fight this time
 ab tak aae parinaam ke anusaar, 33 jila parishad main 20 bhaajapa ke paas he, jabaki aath congress ko mili hai
 Results of four are yet to come
 panchayat samitiyon ke kul siten 6236 hai, jinamein 2960 bhaajapa ko mili hai or 2490 congress ko, lekin in rujhaanon main jo aankade gaur karne ke hai, ve hai loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon ke mukaable is baar bhaajapa kaa vot share gata he
 According to Congress President Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan giving these elections the return of Congress, BJP got 55% vote share in Lok Sabha elections, now after 8 months it has become 46% whereas Congress vote share is 30 in Lok Sabha elections
 %, Which has increased and increased to 45%
 yani ki panchayat chunaavon main bijepi or congress ke bich jeet kaa antar sirf 2% rahaa he
 The BJP says that the figures for the assembly elections should not be compared to the panchayat elections
 1995 se lekar ab tak bijepi kaa gramin ilaakon main vot share lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he or panchayat chunaav ke nattejey sirf gramin voton kaa rujhaan hota he
 There is currently no anti-incumbency against the Vasundhara government
 bhaajapa ke pravaktaa kailash nath bhatta kaa kahana he ki 1995 se pehle bijepi ko 32% vot mila tha, uske baad agle chunaav main 40% mila or phir 42% milane ke baad ab 46% par pahunchaa he isliye main kah rahaa hum ki ye hamaari sweep he
 Each party is making different claims about the figures
 kya panchayat ke chunaavon ke ye nattejey is baat ko darshaate hai ki bijepi ke khilaaf hawa badal rahi he yaa phir gaanvon ke sthaneey mudde haaavee rahe hai
 
 
 This time will tell, but the Panchayat elections in Rajasthan were also special because for the first time in the country, there was provision for education in them
 sarpanch kaa chunaav ladane ke liye 8veen kaa certificate dikhaanaa zaruri tha or panchayat samiti or jila parishad kaa sadsy banane ke liye 10veen kaa, lekin kai aise bhi gaanv hai jahaan padhaa likhaa vyakti mila hi nahin
 In 13 villages of Rajasthan, the sarpanch did not go because he could not find an educated candidate
 bhilwara ke paas ek aisa hi gaanv tha bhadu seat adivasee mahila ke liye arakshit he, lekin is gaanv main paanchavin paas mahila bhi nahin mili
 Khan Singh Chundawat, a resident of the village, said that our village has a population of 20% of the tribe, but there is not a single female fifth

 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki jab se hamane in fasalon ko upjanaa shuru kiya he, tab se ab tak itani buree haalat main kabhi nahin rahe jitani ab he
 The condition is that tomato and garlic farmers are throwing roadside animals to eat
 jaipur kaa sarna duunger kaa khora bisal ilaaka deshbhar main tamaato ke utpaadan ke liye janaa jaataa he
 There is hardly any place in the country where tomatoes are not loaded by trucks, but this time the condition is that the tomatoes of the farmers are rotting in the fields and no one is going to buy them
 mandiyon main he jaanwaron kaa dirakisaanon ne khet ke paas jo mandi banaai hui hai vahaan in dinon jaanwaron kaa deraa he
 Sheep, goats and buffaloes sit here in flocks to eat tomatoes
 kai dinon tak kisaanon ke paas koi kharidaar nahin aata jiske baad unhen jaanwaron ke saamne phenkane ke alaava koi doosraa rasta nahin bachataa
 The condition of the farmers is that they are ready to sell tomatoes in the range of 1 to 2 rupees per kg, but no one is coming to buy them
 kheton main sad rahi kisaanon kii fasalakisaanon kii fasal kheton main hi sad rahi he
 Farmers say that since the relationship between India and Pakistan has deteriorated, their condition has also deteriorated
 jab desh main fasal zyada hoti thi to tamaato pakistan jaataa tha lekin pakistan border sij he or desh main tamaato kii fasal itani zyada hui he ki koi kharidaar nahin he
 Actually, last time people had planted less tomato crop because it did not get good prices, due to which their price was very high
 isi ke chalate is baad acchhee fasal paidaa kii gai lekin ab iske kharidaar nahin mil rahe hai
 Tomato grower is Rameshwar Yadav
 jinhone ek ek bigha main 3 lakh ke tamaato lagaae hai lekin ek lakh bhi kamai bhi nahin ho rahi he
 In such a situation, a debt of 2 lakh has gone up to them
 mirch ugane vaale kisaan bhi pareshantamato ugane vaale kisaanon ke alaava mirch, pyaaj or lahasun ugane vaale kisaan bhi pareshaan hai
 He says that chili is not buying even a rupee a kilo and that the farmer's house is getting spoiled
 lahasun ke bhi nahin mil rahe damrajasthan ke kota main lahasun kii banpar paidaavaar hoti he or har baar kisaan ko lahasun kaa uchit mulya nahin mil paata
 The farmer here is forced to throw garlic
 kota main asia kii sabase badi mandi bhamashah mandi he or yahaan par puure hadoti kaa kisaan lahasun lekar aata he lekin is baar bhi kisaan ko lahasun kaa daam nahin mil paa rahaa he
 His garlic is being sold in the market for three to four rupees per kg, which is not even his cost
 aise main kisaan mandi main maal nahin laa paa rahaa he or use kheton main hi phenk rahe hai
 Kota has produced 8 to 9 lakh metric tons of garlic, out of which 1,54,000 metric tons of garlic has been targeted to be procured under the Market Intervention Scheme, which has been set at Rs 3,257 per quintal, but strict criteria have been laid for it
 The thickness of garlic should be more than 25 MM and the garlic should not be yellow, but thick
 iske saath hi kisaan ko online registration karakar token lenaa padegaa jisamen usko bhamashah card, girdaavari report, passbook, aadhaar card kii anivaaryta rakhi gai he
 In such a situation, many farmers are unable to complete these formalities
 jab kisaan is maapdand ko puraa nahin kar pate to unhen majabuuran bazaar main 3-4 rupee prati kilo ke hisaab se lahasun bechnaa padataa he
 Kota MP Om Birla had met the Union Agriculture Minister recently and talked about the purchase of garlic in the market intervention scheme
 uske baad sahakaarita mantri ne 26 april se bazaar hastkshep yojana se lahasun kii kharid kii ghoshnaa kii lekin kade maapdandon ke chalate ismenkisanon kaa lahasun nahin kharidpa rahaa he
 Only 1500 quintals of garlic have been purchased so far
 kisaan rajendra prasad kaa bataaya ki wo 100 katte lahasun laae hai jinaki keemat unhen 1100-1200 rupee mil rahi he
 In such a situation, he is forced to throw it
 unhone bataaya ki itani keemat main unhe iskaa laagat mulya bhi nahin mil paa rahaa he
 Onion is also crying, there is a lot of anger among the farmers about the decision of the Central Government to purchase at the government rate while determining the length of the onion
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki centre sarkaar betuke faisle jari kar kisaanon ke saath majaak kar rahi he
 Farmers expressed their anger at the decision to purchase 35 MM onion at the government rate and said that onion grows in the field and does not get made in the factory to prevent its length and breadth
 desh main sikar pyaaj utpaadan ke liye nasik ke baad duusare paaydaan par he yahaan sikar main pyaaj kii paidaavaar banpar hoti he lekin kisaanon ko unki laagat nahin milane se niraashaa hi haath lagati he
 Onion is being sold for Rs 5-7 per kg in Sikar
 kisaanon ne 35 MM ke pyaaj kii lambaai ke faisle ko nakaarte hue sarkaar se is faisle ko waapas lene kii maang kii he

 Kejriwal wrote that he would withdraw his candidature from the Legislative Assembly if the complaint of wrong use of money came out right

 ) Imran Khan is going to become the new Prime Minister of Pakistan
 chunaavon main mili aankadon main jeet dikhaai dene ke baad imran khan ne press conference kii
 In this press conference, Imran Khan drew the vision of New Pakistan before the country
 aaazaad mulk banane ke baad se ab tak pakistan kya bana or ab vah apane kaarykaal ke dauraan kaisaa nayaa pakistan banaaenge? lekin kya imran khan kii daleelein sirf yah kah gayi ki nayaa pakistan banane kaa formula unhen bharat se mila he or us formule ko kargar karne ke liye vah china ke model par bharosa karne ja rahe hai?imran khan ne satta kii bhanak lagane ke baad daawa kiya ki vah beete 70 saal se pakistan ke saath ho rahe khilwaad ko band karne kii disha main kadam uthaaenge
 Imran made it clear that till now work has been done for the good of those sitting around power in Pakistan
 iskaa nateeja he ki aaj pakistan main ek bada garib tabaka shiksha, swasth jaisi moolbhoot suvidhaon se vanchit rahaa he
 Therefore, he will now try to reverse the winds of politics in such a way that the assessment of development in Pakistan will be started on the basis of the situation of the poor there
 gauratlab he ki bharat ke chunaavon main garibon ko raajnneeti ke kendra main laane kii kahani 1970 ke dashak main hui or lagaataar 2014 ke aam chunaavon tak gunj rahi he
 But along with adopting this formula, Imran also made it clear that he will turn to China to remove poverty from Pakistan
 china se sabak lete hue vah apane mulk main garibon ko vikaas kii mukhyadhara main laane kaa kaam karenge
 Imran even claimed that the dog would not be allowed to remain empty stomach in his state
 lihaaja, nayaa pakistan garibi se mukt hoga
 Sharing the vision of a new Pakistan, Imran Khan claimed that now law will be dominated in Pakistan
 iske saath hi nae pakistan main bhrashtachar par lagaam lagane kii kavayad ko jor diya jayega
 For this work, Imran indicated that now during his tenure, the fight against corruption will be fought by a central agency
 is agency ke daayre main sabase pehle desh kaa pradhanmantri or unke mantri ko rakhaa jayega
 Therefore, even Imran Khan told the formula of Lokpal exercise in India to his country
 lekin iske baad misaal ke taur par imran ne kaha ki vah iske liye china kaa rukh karenge
 According to Imran, after taking command of the government, he will send a special team to China, who will learn from the Chinese government the basics of curbing corruption and pledge to eliminate corruption from Pakistan
 haalanki imran ne virodhabhas yah kah kar dikhaa diya ki unki is muhim main raajnneetik vidwesh se kaam nahin kiya jayega
 So, now it needs to be seen how this formula for India will proceed on the Chinese model without any political rancor
 pakistan kii maujuuda chunautiyon kaa zikr karte hue imran khan ne kaha ki unke desh kii sabase badi jarurat ek bada nivesh he
 This investment will generate huge employment resources in Pakistan
 nae rojgaar laane se desh main bhatke hue yuvaaon ko jivan kii mukhyadhar main khinchaa ja sakegaa
 Pakistan needs to make a big improvement in its Ease of Doing Business Index to attract this large investment
 yah sudhaar karne ke baad vah pakistan main surakshit kaarobaar kaa daawa karne ke liye apravasi pakistaniyon ko lubhaayenge jisase vah apana nivesh dubai le jane kii jagah pakistan lekar aaen
 After explaining this entire formula, Imran bluntly said that he will decide the way of big investment by China
 imran ke mutabik pakistan main chal rahe china silk road project ke bharose vah pakistan main bada nivesh laaenge or desh ko vikaas ke hai-speed haive par rakh denge
 Finally, Imran Khan said that Pakistan is a country which is among the 5 major bailout countries in the world
 lekin pakistan main log apni sarkaar ko tex adaa karne ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Imran Khan assured that now the new Pakistan needs to pay tax
 imran ne bharosa dilaayaa ki unka diya gaya tex puri tarah se surakshit rahegaa kyonki vah khud pakistan ke khajaane kii chaukeedaari karenge
 Now it remains to be seen how Imran Khan, after assuming the reins of power, takes China’s model on these formulas of India and takes Pakistan with full balance towards the new Pakistan

Why do you think that what your legal department has said is the last truth? Expressing his displeasure at the Modi government, Chidambaram said, "it would have been better to have spent time in enacting such a law, that it would be a deteriorating economy, unemployment and Mob focused on dealing with lynching

 It is hard for the boys not to love, to express it
 ladkiyaan is maamle main unase thik ulat hai
 This is where the insecurity starts between two love birds
 aksar ladakiyon or patniyon ko shikaayat hoti he ki unke bwoyfriend yaa pati unhen 'ai lav you' nahin kehete hai

 He has been awarded many awards worldwide for his contribution in the field of literature
 2008 main da times ne 50 mahaan british lekhakon kii suchi main naypaul ko saatvaan sthaan diya tha
 The special thing was that the works from 1945 onwards were to be given place in this list
 naypaul kii kuch ullekhneey kritiyon main in e free state (1971), e ve in da world (1994), half e life (2001), magic seeds (2004) jaisi kitaaben shaamil hai
 The said introduction is necessary because a large part of the general reading enthusiast buys the book only after knowing about the author at the book stall
 haalanki bhartiya mul ke naypaul kisi parichay ke mohataaj nahin rahe, lekin yah parichay or parichay main yah likhnaa ki lekhak ne lekhan ke alaava koi or vyavsaay nahin chunaa, jaruri he
 One of his books is 'A Writer's People', which is quite interesting
 jaisaa ki naam se hi spsht he ki yahkitabun logon ke bare main he, jisase lekhak kaa sambandh rahaa he, jinase unke lekhan kaa sambandh rahaa he yaa phir yah ki vah jinhone unhen likhane ke liye prerit kiya
 Naipaul has worked in this book to cover his writing journey
 yah ek kahani he, us 10 saal ke bachche kii jo lekhak bananaa chahta he, likhnaa chahta he
 He starts it with his diary and then Rama keeps thinking about what to write, what not to write
 yah kitaab ek lekhak ke rup main naypaul kii soch he
 He says, 'I have been thinking of ways to see my whole life and how they change the outline of the world
 ' During the elections, BJP candidate from Bhopal Pragya Singh Thakur was asked to speak less often, his attitude did not soften even after the election

 On the removal of Article 370 from Kashmir, Pragya said that after this, the category of those who are patriots has been separated
 deshbhakt ullas manaa rahe hai or jo ro rahe hai vah desh bhakt to ho hi nahin sakate
 Those who are happy with the removal of Sections 370 and 35A are proud of our country, those who are proud of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah are patriots
 unhone kaha ki yah paribhaasha is baar siddh ho gai he ki koun desh ke saath he or koun desh ke viruddh he'
 On the opposition of Digvijay Singh on the removal of Article 370 from Kashmir, Pragya said that 'we had fought elections because people working for national religion should come in the middle
 vahiin janata ne un logon ko bilkul nakaar diya he jinhen yahaan nahin hona chahie
 Earlier, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, during the membership drive in Odisha, called the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru a criminal for imposing Article 370 in Kashmir, after which a controversy arose across the country
 haalanki baad main bhopal aakar shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha tha ki jawaharlal nehru ko lekar unhone jo kuch bhi odisha main kaha, vah tathyon ke aadhaar par kaha
 The Congress has retaliated in this matter
 madhyapradesh congress kii media prabharee shobhaa ojha ne kaha ki pragna thakur ke andar kaa godse bol rahaa he
 Pragya Thakur Ji's history is not hidden from anyone, he is not speaking from Godse inside him
 pragna thakur ho, shivaraj singh chouhan ho ye godsevaadi vichaardhaara ke log hai
 Those who say abusive words to Gandhi ji, sometimes they say abusive words to Nehru ji, they have neither had anything to do with freedom struggle nor have anything to do with martyrdom and neither have people ever worried about the country

 rishte main kadavaahat aane kii bahut si vajahen ho sakati hai
 Sometimes they are very serious, sometimes they are so common that they do not get our attention
 haal main hue ek survey ke anusaar, ladaai-jhagade ke dauraan galat shabdon kaa istemaal bhi rishton main bikharaav kii vajah ban jaataa he
 a study in the UK has revealed that it is a good thing to be true to your relationship, but excessive openness can spoil your relationship
 aise main partner se ye 6 baaten chhipaakar rakhana hi aapke rishte ke liye behatar hoga
 1
 kabhi bhi rishta khatm karne kii baat na kahenkai baar aisa hota he ki aapas main kiye vaade or baaten samay par nahin puri ho pate
 This does not mean that your partner does not love you and you start talking about ending your relationship because of that one promise not being fulfilled
 kya karen:apanepartner se zyada se zyada baat karneki koshish karen or unki baton ko samajhnaa bhi seekhen
 What not to do: Do not talk unnecessarily whenever a situation of fighting and fighting takes place
 2
 Avoid saying the partner is unfortunate, anger is not the solution to anything
 aise main koi bhi aisi baat na kahen jiskaa asar lambey samay tak bana rahe
 What to do: It is good to remain silent during the anger
 gussa tanaav ko badha detaa he isliye jab bhi aisa ho kisi shant jagah jaakar baithen
 What not to do: Avoid being angry at the partner
 3
 By remembering the relationship days, remember to avoid calling your partner and your relationship good and bad
 aisa karke aap apane rishte main kadavaahat hi paidaa karenge
 What to do: Everyone has the right to live freely, so share the responsibilities of the house so that you do not feel tied
 aisa karke aap khud ke liye bhi time nikaal paaenge
 What not to do: Do not sit with cries of responsibility
 4
 Avoid comparing yourself to family, do you want to make me like your mother or why you are like your father
 
 
 aisi baaten karne se bachein
 These things of yours are enough to hurt your partner and spoil your image
 kya karen:soch kar dekhen ki agar aapke parivaaravaalon ke bare main aapkapartner aise bole to aapako kaisaa lagegaa
 What not to do: Do not target family even in jest
 5
 Do not talk about any of your crush if you have liked someone in your office or a party, then avoid comparing it to your partner
 kai baar stress ke kaaran yaa phir rishte main utaar chadhaav ke chalate aisi sthiti saamne aa jaati he
 What to do: Just keep any such crush or likes up to your dreams
 hakeekat main aapke partner se behatar kuch nahin he
 Don'ts: Never allow yourself to be vulnerable in such a situation
 6
 Stop talking to the heart when you were in the beginning of a relationship and used to ignore things
 agar aap donon ke bich kisi baat ko lekar bahes ho rahi he to baat ko vahiin khatm karne kii koshish karen
 What to do: Instead of pulling the talk, saying sorry for yourself at the fault of the partner will also end the matter and new freshness will remain in the relationship
 kya na karen:baat agar gambhir vishay par ho rahi he to use ignor karne se bachein

 jepi ko yaad karnaa kya itnaa aasaan he
 After decades, JP can now only be remembered as an idol
 unki sampurna kranti ko sampoornataa main dekhne kaa kahaan vakt he
 If many generations have changed, then it is better to perform the ritual of wreathing and remembering
 par loktantr ke liye sukhad he ki jepi kaa naam kisi na kisi bahaane lautataa rahe
 Unsuccessfully, but the questions raised about democracy in post-independence India are the first stop of those questions
 jepi ko yaad karne kaa matlab he loktantr ke sawaalon ko yaad karnaa
 Recall of failures brings positiveness
 sirf sakaaraatmakataa kii chaasani pasand karne vaale wo dhoort log hote hai jo iske naam par jivan kii sachchaaiyon ko khatm kar dena chaahate hai
 B

 It was raining heavily in Patna's Gandhi Maidan that day

 agar mujhe thik thik yaad he to lakhon logon kii bheed main us budhi nani kaa haath pakad kar maine bhi jepi ko dekha tha
 After that, when he regained consciousness, JP found himself alive in every debate
 wo us aatma kii tarah the jo har bahes main bhoot kaa rup dhar kar tapak aate the
 Debaters quickly ran away with his name
 aaj usee jepi ko yaad karne ke liye divangat patrkaar prabhaash joshi ke lekhon ko palatney laga
 Rajkamal Prakashan has published a collection of his articles
 ek lekh he jab top mukabih ho sangrah main or doosraa lutian ke tile kaa bhugol
 i just want to put the questions raised by JP here on the pretext of that article so that jp's ghost becomes alive again and then whoever has to run away
 jepi or indira gandhi lekh kaa sheershak he
 Prabhash Joshi writes that “four crores of rupees were collected from UP and Odisha assembly elections
 isse jepi itane chintit hue ki indira ji se milane gaye or kaha ki congress agar itane paise ikatthe karegi or ek ek chunaav main lakhon rupaya kharch kiya jayega to loktantr kaa matlab kya rah jayega
 Only those who will have the power and muscle power will be able to contest
 maamuli aadmi ke liye to koi gunzaaish rahegi nahin
 JP told that Indira kept clipping her nails throughout the conversation
 indira ke is ravaiye se jepi bahut dukhi hue
 " kya aaj jepi kaa naam lene vaale is sawaal se takaraana chahenge
 Which leader who took the name has also played the formality of speaking against the expensive electoral politics
 jepi bas maale ke manake samaan he
 Quickly count and chant

 These are questions of JP

 Family wise is not the only disease
 sthaneey se lekar rashtriya str par raajnneeti main shaamil logon kaa ek network ban gaya he jo thekon se lekar dilarship ke sahare falphul rahaa he
 It is not easy for an ordinary person to participate in democracy in this network
 raajnneetik dal ab is network ko kiraaye par lene lage hai
 This network can now be made by any party and any party can join it and get power
 tab jepi kaa naam lekar satta main aae netaaon ne aisa kuch nahin kiya jisase janata or indira banane vaale netaaon ko sabak mil sake
 Today, Indira's image is easily discovered in a leader
 netaaon ko isse dikkat bhi nahin hoti
 We could not decide whether Indira was the villain of the Emergency or the plaster of Paris to become the ideal leader in which anyone becomes a leader like Indira
 prabhaash joshi aakhir main likhte hai ki is tarah indira gandhi ko pakadaney, jail bhejne or sajaa dene kii janata sarkaar kii koshish nautanki main samaapt ho gai
 JP had said not to take retaliatory action

 After the Emergency all those parties and all those leaders who have been in the JP movement - from Morarji Desai to Atal Bihari Vajpayee - have come to power
 pehle janata party kii aguai thi phir janata dal kii hui phir tisare morche kii or ab bhartiya janata party kii
 They have all come up the ladder of the JP movement and have now left the way to reach the public by lifting the ladder

 Any leader and party who came to share the monarchy of power, proved that there is only one way to run the rule and that is the Congress way
 "bechaare jepi kaha karte the ki yah andolan inamen se kisi rajaneta ko indira gandhi kii jagah baitaane or gaiyr-congress partiyon kaa raaj sthapit karne ke liye nahin he
 This is to place the people on the throne, who are getting up from the hut and traveling towards the capital
 jepi aandolan or sampoorn kranti ke netaaon ne janata ko waapas jhonpadiyon main bhej diya or singhasano par khud kabja kiye hue hai
 '' prabhaash joshi kii yah baat aaj bhi kah rahi he ki har raajnneetik andolan kaa sakht moolyankan hona chahie
 It is good that we remember our leaders and keep running their names on one pretext or the other, but it will be better when we also keep their questions in front

 Is India angry at not joining the One Belt One Road project, is it annoyed with the close proximity of India and the US, is the anger of the Dalai Lama going to Arunachal Pradesh, there is no clear reason
 2014 main jab china ke raashtrapati bharat aae the tab unka bhavy swaagat kiya gaya tha
 On the banks of the Sabarmati, a swing was also made, even then China had infiltrated the Ladakh region
 tab bhi kya us ghuspaith ko ham in kaarnon ke sandarbh main dekh sakate hai
 At that time, India did not even oppose the One Belt One Road
 aapako bataa den van belt, van road china kaa ab tak kaa sabase mahatvakankshi project he, jiskaa bajet he das kharab america dollar yani saat sau kharab rupye jo bharat kii kul arthvyavastha kaa qareeb ek tihaai he
 One Belt One Road is the dream of Chinese President Xi Jinping
 jiskaa makasad bataaya gaya he asian deshon ke saath china kaa sampark or sahyog behatar karnaa or africa or europe ko bhi asian deshon ke saath qareebi se jodna
 Representatives of 29 countries including China and representatives of 70 other countries were present at its inauguration in Beijing

 At that time, China had issued a statement saying that its border dispute with India was going on, so there was restraint in building infrastructure in Northeast India
 arunachal pradesh main dalai lamas kii yatra ke samay china ne aisi pratikriya vyakt kii thi
 But this is the reason, the Dalai Lama went to Arunachal Pradesh even during the UPA era and then India has made some special changes in its policy regarding Tibet or has added aggression in the old policy, it is also not clear
 zaahir he china hamaare saamne maujuud kaarnon se nahin chidhaa hoga, kaaran kuch or honge
 We are accustomed to looking at the immediate cause of China, it is better to review its long-term policies along with the immediate reasons
 ho saktaa he duniya ke str par samrik gathbandhan badal rahe hon
 The Prime Minister of India openly talks about the century of Asia, China has a strong desire to lead Asia

 The Royal Bhutan Army, which is patrolling there, stops and the Indian Army also joins it
 khabar ai ki china ne bharat ke asthaayee bunker dhwast kar diye
 The media report said that there was a rift between the soldiers of China and India
 hathiyaaron kaa istamaal nahin hua
 India does not want China to complete the road there, so that it will reach very close to the Siliguri Corridor
 udhar china kaa daawa he ki vah apni seemaa main sadak bana rahaa he
 India is accusing it of encroaching on its border
 vahaan kii sena piele ke pravaktaa ne bharat ko 1962 yuddh kii haar kii yaad dilaate hue kaha ki bharat kii sena yuddh ke liye zyaada baichaiyn na ho
 Why was there a need for rhetoric to this extent? bharat ke thal senadhyaksh general bipin ravat ne kaha tha ki bharat apni aantarik ugravad se jujhate hue bhi do tarafa yuddh jhel saktaa he
 India does not feel under the psychological pressure of China from anywhere
 balki shuukravaar ko videsh mantralay ne ek bayaan diya ki bharat china ke tazaa kadamon ko lekar chintit he or china kii sarkaar ko apni chintaa se avgat kara chukaa he ki is tarah ke nirmaan se yathasthiti main kaaphi badlaav aa jaataa he

 bharat ke raksha mantri arun jetali ne india today channel ke kaarykram main bayaan de diya ki bharat bhi 1962 vaala bharat nahin he, 2017 kaa bharat he
 a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry also did not lend a reply
 kaha ki china bhi 1962 vaala china nahin he
 Defense Minister Jaitley says that the confrontation in the area was initiated by Beijing with the road construction initiative, which India is concerned about
 dokalam kaa maujuuda vivaadit kshetra maatr 90 varg kimi kaa pahari ilaaka he
 China is building a road via Doklam to reach Bhutan's border
 china kaa kahana he ki sikkim par 1890 kii china or britain kii sandhi kaa bharat ke purv pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne bhi samarthan kiya tha
 He supported this in a letter sent to the then Prime Minister of China, Chou En Lai
 china kaa kahana he ki bharat is sandhi kaa sammaan kare or doklam se apni sena ko waapas bulaae
 Bhutan has told China that it is encroaching its border, on which China says that India is using Bhutan as a shield
 bharat or bhutan ke bich samjhauta he ki bharat bhutan kii simaaon kii suraksha karegaa
 Claiming on a geographical area by showing a letter is also strangely ridiculous
 antarrashtriya simaaon par chitthee or bayanon se daawa kiya jane lage to ho chukaa
 Obviously, experts are trying to understand why China is so aggressive
 kya bharat ke van belt van road project main shaamil na hone se naaraaz he, kya bharat or america kii nazadiiki se naaraaz he, kya dalai lamas ke arunachal pradesh jane se naaraaz he, koi ek spasht kaaran nazar nahin aata he
 When the President of China came to India in 2014, he was given a grand welcome
 sabarmati ke tat par jhula bhi jhulaayaa gaya tha tab bhi china ne ladakh kshetra main ghuspaith kar di thi
 Even then, can we see that intrusion in terms of these reasons
 tab to bharat ne van belt van road kaa virodh bhi nahin kiya tha
 Let us tell you, One Belt, One Road is the most ambitious project of China so far, whose budget is one trillion US dollars i
e
 seven hundred trillion rupees which is about one third of the total economy of India
 van belt van road china ke raashtrapati shi chinafing kaa sapana he
 The aim of which has been stated to improve China's contact and cooperation with Asian countries and also to connect Africa and Europe closely with Asian countries
 beijing main iske udghaatan ke maukey par china samet 29 deshon ke rashtrapramukh or 70 anya deshon ke pratinidhi maujuud rahe
 Under this project, trade routes will be improved through land and sea routes
 kai hai speed rail network honge jo europe tak jaaenge
 This route will pass through several ports in Asia and Africa and many free trade zones will come through it
 china duniya ke pansth deshon ko ek duusare ke qareeb laaegaa or duniya kii do-tihaai aabaadi ko apni arthvyavastha se sidhe jod degaa
 The comments bharat ne tab bhi apni bhugolic samprabhutaa ko praathamikta di or itane mahatvapurn project se khud ko alag kar liya
 Why was China upset in May when Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi went to inaugurate the bridge connecting Assam and Arunachal Pradesh
 tab to ve trump ke america bhi nahin gaye the
 At that time, Trump had praised the President of China
 brahmaputra nadi par bane is pul ke kaaran assam or arunachal pradesh kaaphi kareeb aa gaye
 This bridge is very close to the india-china border
 tab china ne bayaan jari kar kaha tha ki bharat ke saath uskaa seemaa vivaad chal rahaa he isliye purvottar bharat main buniyadi dhaanchon kaa nirmaan karne main sanyam barte
 China had expressed such a reaction during the Dalai Lama's visit to Arunachal Pradesh
 magar yah kaaran he to upie ke daur main bhi dalai lamas arunachal pradesh gaye the or phir tibet ko lekar bharat ne apni niti main koi khaas parivartan kiya he yaa puraani niti main aakramta kaa put daalaa he, yah bhi saaf nahin he
 Obviously, China will not tease us with the reasons, the reasons will be different
 china ko ham taatkaalik kaarnon kii nazar se dekhne ke aadi rahe hai, behatar he taatkaalik kaarnon ke saath-saath uski doorgaami nitiyon kii bhi samiksha kerani chahie
 Strategic alliances may be changing at the world level
 bharat ke pradhanmantri khulkar asia kii sadi kii baat karte hai, china asia ke netritv karne kii dabi ichha rakhata he
 If it sometimes surrounds India with Pakistan through Gwadar project, India meets Iran 72 km away from there and gets out of China through the Chabahar project
 par kya china bhartiya seemaa par saamaanya se zyaada sakriy ho rahaa he? India and China have been hitting near the Line of Actual Control on the Jammu and Kashmir border
 2013 or 2014 main china ne bharat kii seemaa main ghuspaith kii thi
 Doklam's controversy has become so popular for the first time
