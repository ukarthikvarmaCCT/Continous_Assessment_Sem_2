 That's because the beginning of the role of 'an Atlas of Love' is something like this- have you ever loved someone enough to become a pain? Has love ever peeked into your life when you haven't even thought about it? Can love be infinite and forgiving beyond time? Of course, after reading these lines, you would think that this is one of those innumerable books drenched in the pain of love, which nowadays are laced in shops like a rainy worm
 asal main yahi vah pal he jab yah kitaab aapako galat sabit karti he
 There is no fixed definition or interpretation of love
 lekin kehane vaale kah gaye hai ki vah pyaar hi he jo duniya ko chalaata he
 Getting a spouse transmits such energy to a person that if needed he can do two hands with the world
 yahi nahin jo apaar prem or prashansa paata he, vah ek khushhaal vyakti he or aanandamay jivan ke sapane sanjota he
 In the midst of all the challenges of life, one who loves and finds love begins to see the world through the pink spectacles of love
 'en atlas of lav' 16 aisi kahaniyon kaa sankalan he, jo aapako aise hi vichaaron or virodhabhaason ke bich gote lagavati he
 All the 16 short stories included in the stories written by the common people have been selected after a national level competition organized by Rupa
 kathaon kaa sampadan anuja chouhan ne kiya he, jo khud prem kahaniyon kii jaani-maani lekhika hai
 The authors whose stories are given place in the book are many journalists, bank workers and many hometowns
 asal main yah kitaab in 16 kahaniyon ke jariye prem ke padchihnon par chalate hue un sabhi ayaamon tak pahunchane kaa prayaas karti he, jahaan khushi he, gam he, dukh he, niraashaa he, aashaa he or punarjagran he
 Regardless of the form, time and situation in which love has come into your life, one thing is certain that you will feel connected to the love stories included in the book somewhere
 Just one glance or Blossoms jaisi kahani skool ke un dinon kii yaad dilaati he jab ham class main kitaab ke pannon ke bich apane saathi ko nazren bachaakar jhaanka karte the
 Or those paths on which our only aim was to walk for a moment to behold our love
 pyaar kii khoj se lekar aashaa takephoenid mills main aap bataur pathak ek jawan aadmi ke saath pyaar kii khoj main nikalate hai, jabaki Jilted main aapkaa parichay prem ke saahsee rup se hota he
 The Impasse is the story of the love of a husband who cannot stop his wife from leaving
 Something about Karen main aap us nayika ke dard ko mahasoos karte hai jo aspataal main apane premi se yah jaanate hue bhi milane jaati he vah use pahchaan nahin paaegaa
 Apart from this, Death of a Widower and Siddharth have a depiction of the hope of love
 kyon padhaa jaaeyah kitaab is myne main khaas he ki yah prem ke bare main hamaari samaj ko viksit karti he
 Beyond the definitions of traditional love, it discusses those forms of love that are real
 kitaab main aisi kai rachanaatmak or rochak kahaniyaan hai jo hamen prem se prem karne ko majaboor kar detii hai
 In The Affair, a story in the book, we encounter the reluctance and pain of the woman who loves a married man
 post-coital Cigarette main hamen us jununee pati se hamadardi hoti he jo apni patni se beintahaan pyaar karata he, lekin saath hi use yah bhi shaq he ki uski patni kaa vishwaas rishte se uth chukaa he or wo usase alag hone ke bare main soch rahi he
 At that time, when he sleeps at night, he thinks why not burn the whole house and commit suicide along with the wife, so that they can never be separated
 ek kitaab ke rup main 'en atlas of lav' prem ke har sambhav andaaj or uske sabak ko pathak tak pahunchane kaa kaam karti he
 The stories of different narrators are both the hallmark and hallmark of the book
 haalanki yah dukhad he ki in 16 kahaniyon main prem kii kuch nai paribhaashaon yaa yah kahen ki 21veen sadi main prem ke nae or aadhunik ayaamon ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he

 videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne shuukravaar ko sansad main kaha kiitaly ke nausainikonko sajaa-e-maut nahin di jaaegi
 Earlier, Khurshid said that diplomacy did its job in ensuring the return of India to the nine soldiers of Italy accused of killing two Indian fishermen and this cannot be dismissed
 khurshid ne kaha, ‘aapako kootneeti ko jald khaarij nahin karnaa chahie
 It can be said that diplomacy works even when all things fail
 kootneeti ko apana kaam karne kaa mauka dijiye
 'sonia, who ranted on Italy, said fulfilled the promise, gave credit for success in this matter to Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 khurshid ne kaha, ‘yah sarkaar jis kootneeti kaa anusaran kar rahi he, uskaa netritv pradhanmantri va congress adhyaksh hi kar rahe hai
 It would be unfair for anyone among us to take credit for this
 ’videsh mantri ne kaha ki supreme court ko agle saptaah vaidhanik prakriyaaon ke anusaar taaja ghatnakram kii jaankaree di jaaegi
 He also spoke of taking Parliament into confidence on this issue
 italy ke rajdoot ke desh chhodane par roak rahegi jarikhurshid ne kaha, ‘ham is mudde par sansad ko bhi bharose main lenge
 This will be conveyed to Parliament, as it was a major issue during the Parliament session
 ’isse pehle centre sarkaar ne aaropee italvi nau sainikon ke desh lautne kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin wrote on microblogging site Twitter, 'after being contacted at the diplomatic level, Italy reported that the nine soldiers would return within the time limit set by the Supreme Court of India
 ’italy ke rajdoot danniel mensini ne supreme court se vaada kiya tha ki desh ke aam chunaav main matdaan ke baad ve 22 march tak bharat laut aaenge
 But on March 11, Italy refused to send nine of its troops here, after which diplomatic tension between the two countries had erupted
 supreme court ne italy ke rajdoot ke desh chhodane par bhi pabandi laga di
 On February 15, 2012, nine Italian soldiers were accused of shooting Indian fishermen's boat in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Kerala as a pirate in which two fishermen were killed

 For this, approval from Parliament is necessary

 The state government will decide to send a proposal to include these castes in the Scheduled Castes to the Central Government only after seeing the decision of the Court
 yogi sarkaar se pehle akhilesh yadav or mulaayam singh yadav ne bhi in 17 obisi jatiyon ko essi main shaamil karne kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 Mulayam Singh had issued an order in 2005 to include these 17 backward castes in the Scheduled Castes
 mulaayam ke is faisle par hoicourt ne roak laga di thi
 After this, the government in Uttar Pradesh changed and Mayawati became the Chief Minister in 2007 when the proposal was rejected
 iske baad in jatiyon ke anusuchit jati ke shaamil hone ke mansoobey par pani phir gaya
 Though Mayawati later wrote a letter to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh demanding her inclusion in the Scheduled Castes to help these castes, but the Central Government did not pay any heed to it

 Accepted on man-manawwal, 11 rupayedulhe of Shagun said- i had decided, i will not take dowry society today when dowry is becoming greedy
 kai bahuen dahej kii balivedi par chadha di ja rahi hai
 In such a war against Mendejich's evil practice, a CISF jawan in Rajasthan has set an example by marrying without dowry
 jawan ne apni shaadi main 11 lakh rupee kaa dahej vinamrata se thukraa diya
 This groom from Rajasthan returned a plate filled with a dowry of Rs 11 lakh
 duulhe ne shagun ke taur par mahaj 11 rupee lekar shaadi kii
 The groom is posted as constable in the ISF
 uski tainaati chhattisgarh main he
 This sentence is being discussed everywhere
 log duulhe ke is kadam kii jamkar prashansa kar rahe hai
 It is said that Constable Jitendra Singh was married to Chanchal, the daughter of Govind Singh
 shaadi ke liye tay tithi ko baraat jaipur ke ambawadi pahunchi thi
 Wedding rituals were being performed
 sabakuch saamaanya chal rahaa tha
 On the bride's side, a platter filled with Rs 11 lakh in dowry was handed over to the groom Jeetendra
 thaal ko lene kii bajaay jitendra ne use lekar dene ke liye khadey sasur ke saamne haath jod liye
 This made the bride and the bride both people restless
 har kisi ko laga ki duulhasarkari naukreemen he to kahin aisa na ho ki vah dahej main zyada raashi ke liye naaraaz ho gaya he
 There was also a discussion that there was lack of reception of the procession, due to which he is angry but Jitendra had something else in mind
 maan-manouvval kaa daur shuru hone par jitendra ne khud ko dahej kaa virdohi bataate hue rupayon se bharaa thaal lautaa diya, tab sabko maajaraa samaj aayaa
 After much persuasion, Jeetendra accepted 11 rupees and a naryalleena as an omen and the rest of the marriage rituals were completed
 duulhe ne kya kahajitendra ne kaha ki use jab pataa chalaa ki uski hone vaali patni ne elelbi kar rakhi he aurpiechadikar rahi he, tabhi tay kar liya tha ki shaadi main dahej nahin luungaa
 The bride is more than the money
 duulhe ne patni ke nyaayik seva kii taiyaari karne kii jaankaree di or kaha ki jab vah jaj banakar nyaay karegi, tab vah dahej kii rakam se bhi badhkar hoga
 This step of Jitendra remains a matter of discussion

 i remember that once in a big tarannum, i wrote my own song of the new crop of 'nayi Umar', 'keep watching, keep watching today, i love you, this love will come out', so that everyone has forgotten himself 
 meri buaa ne na jane kitni nazmon ko unki awaz main saheja
 Today, all seems just like yesterday
 haalanki mere liye unki kavita kaa asar tab aayaa, jab inter main padhate hue ek din 'tere mere sapane' film kaa unka geet 'jaise radha ne maala japi shyaam kii' mujhe sunne ko mila
 What was the magic in that song, which once in such a time, in the hypnosis of Neeraj Ji's poem, so that it is not possible to enter this life now prem or rumaan ke is geetkaar ne jaise antas chhu diya ho
 
 phir to unki kavita or uske maadak saundarya ne kabhi aasav to kabhi madiraa kaa kaam kiya
 
 unke saare geet, jaise bheetar kii pukaar banate chale gaye
 Capturing the meaning of those songs, like every time there is a yearning to find the color of musk inside itself
 
 
 'sabake angan diya jaale re', 'more angan hia', 'hawa laage shul jaisi', 'taana maare chunariya', 'aayi he aansu kii baraat', 'bairan ban gayi nindiya
 
 
 'lata ji's voice in this song, the beautiful but painful echo of Raga Patdeep and the pen calling Neeraj's innocence, gave me an expression of grief forever
 aaj tak saikadon baar sune ja chuke is geet ke rumaan se ab bhala koi kyon baahar nikalnaa chahega? wo jaise niraj ko samajhane kii bhi drushti de gaya, jiske peeche kanpur main chhot gaya unka asafal prem shabd badal-badalakar unki raah roktaa rahaa
 You can easily find scattered beads of his famous eyes on Kanpur in his film songs
 'prem pujari' main unka kahan dekhie- 'na buje he kisi jal se ye jalan', jaise sari alaknandaaon kaa jal bhi prem kii agan ko sheethal karne main naakaafi ho
 He also said very beautifully- 'this is my heart, not a bangle
 
 'hi, what a favor, make your heart bangle for the delicate wrists of the beloved
 
 Then, a new way of defining love is drunken in 'shokhi Geh Jaale Phool Ka Shabab'
 
 
 geeton main tadap, rumaan, ehsaas, jazbaat, dard, bechaini, israar, manuhaar, samarpan or shringaar sabhi kuch ko niraj ke ashiq man ne ibaadat kii tarah saadhaa
 Listen to a song of shyness, 'today drunk my heart, my mind', then you will know how different, large and full of freshness and writing range of poet Neeraj was at that time
 
 o ri kali dard tu tu doli / o re wave wave tu tu payal / o ri river dikha tu darpan / o re kiran odha tu aanchal / Ik jogan hai bani aaj dulhan o Go, my mind
 
 
 
 It is difficult to find another songwriter who creates a makeup like Neeraj, who specializes in creating a beauty that goes beyond dreams
 
 However, Neeraj is not just enough
 wo isse bhi paar jate hai
 By becoming a philosopher
 ek banjaare, sufi yaa qalandar kii tarah kuch aisa rachate, jo hosh uda de
 
 'e bhai zaraa dekhake chalo', 'dil aaj shaayar he, gam aaj nagma he,' 'kaaravaan guzar gaya, ghobaar dekhte rahe', 'suuni-suuni saans ke sitar par' or 'kaal kaa pahiyaa, ghume bhaiya
 
 
 'rich philosophicalism, unabashed love, the melodious images flowing in sentiment, his caustic pain making Ragini make him completely different from other Hindi songwriters Pt Narendra Sharma, Gopal Singh Nepali, Bharat Vyas, Indivar, Rajendra Krishna and Yogesh

 aaj, jab wo nahin hai to bahut si baaten, yaad aati hai
 His lyrics are disturbing to the extent of hypnotizing
 mere pita se kahi unki baat jehan main kaundhti he ki 'mere geet hit hote gaye or filmein flop, isliye jaldi hi mujhase geet likhavana logon ne band kar diya'
 But, with the color of flowers, the mind of this passionate mind, writing from the pen of the heart, will never be forgotten
 unki kavitaayen or geet aise hi dukhte man ko tasalli de, bhigote rahenge
 Making the inside and outside wet with the moisture of words
 main aaj bhi, 'tere mere sapane' ke puure soundtrack main khoyaa hua niraj ji ko bade adab se yaad karata rahoonga
 
 
 Then his poetry and its intoxicating beauty sometimes served as infusion and sometimes alcoholism
 
 All his songs, as the inner call went on
 un geeton ke arth ko pakadana ,jaise kuch apane hi andar kasturi ke rang ko khojane kii ek tadap bhari koshish rahi har baar
 
 
 'sabke aangan diya jale re', 'more courtyard hiya', 'hawa lage shul jasi', 'tana mare chunariya', 'aayi hai tearu ki baraat', 'baron became nindia
 
 
 ' is geet main lata ji kii awaz ne, raag patdeep kii sundar magar dard bhari gunj ne or niraj kii beganapan ko pukaarti kalam ne jaise mere liye hameshaa ke vaaste dukh ko shakl dene vaali ek ibaarat de di
 Having heard this song hundreds of times till date, why would anyone want to get out of this song? Like he also gave a vision to understand Neeraj, behind whom his failed love word was left in Kanpur and kept changing his path
 kanpur par unki mashhoor nazm ke bikhare moti aap unke filmi geeton main badi aasaani se dhund sakate hai
 See his saying in 'prem Pujari' - 'no extinguishment is jealous of any water', as if the water of all the Alaknanda is also insufficient to cool the fire of love
 unhone ye bhi badi khubsuurati se kaha- 'chuudi nahin ye meraa dil he, dekho dekho toote naa
 
 ' hai, kya adaa he, preyasi kii najuk kalaayiyon ke liye apane dil ko chuudi bana dena
 
 phir, shokhiyon main ghola jaae phulon kaa shabaab' main nasha tarashte hue pyaar ko paribhaasha dene kaa nayaa andaaz
 
 
 The songs include yearning, romance, feeling, emotion, pain, restlessness, israar, manuhar, dedication and adornment, all of Neeraj's loving mind like a prayer
 sharmili kaa ek geet 'aaj madahosh hua jaae re meraa man' suniye, to jaan padegaa, ki kavi niraj ke likhane kaa form or uski range kitni alag, badi or us daur main bilkul taazgi bhari thi
 
 o ri kali sajaa tu doli / o ri lahar pahana tu paayal / o ri nadi dikhaa tu darapan / o ri kiran odha tu anchal / ek jogan he bani aaj dulhan ho o / aao ud jaaen kahin ban ke pawan ho o / aaj madahosh hua jaae re meraa man
 
 
 
 niraj jaisaa shringaar rachane vaala doosraa geetkaar milanaa mushkil he, jo sapanom ke paar jaati hui sajalataa rachane main maahir ho
 
 haalanki, niraj bas itane bhar nahin he
 They go beyond this
 darshanik banakar
 Like a Banjara, Sufi or Kalandar, create something that will blow your senses
 
 'A Bhai Zara Dekhke Chalo', 'dil aaj shair hai, Gham aaj nagma hai', 'caravan passed away, Gubar dekhte rahe', 'soo-suni sans ke sitar' and 'kaal ka wheel, Ghoom bhaiya
 
 
 ' bharpoor darshaniktaa, labalab chhalakta prem, bhavukta main behate niraale bimb, dard ko raagini bana dene kii unki kaifiyat ne unhen hindi pattee ke anya geetkaaron pan narendra sharma, gopal singh nepali, bharat vyas, indivar, rajendra krishna or yogesh se bilkul alag unki apni banaai li main anuthe dhang se sthapit kiya he
 Today, when they are not there, many things are missed
 unke geet sammohit karne kii had tak pareshaan karte hai
 His words to my father echo in my mind that 'my songs became hits and movies flopped, so people stopped writing songs soon'
 magar, phulon ke rang se, dil kii kalam se paati likhane vaale is bhavuk man ke chitere ko kabhi bhi bhulaayaa nahin ja sakegaa
 His poems and songs will soothe the grieving mind and continue to soak
 shabdon kii nami se andar-baahar ko geela banaate hue
 Even today, throughout the soundtrack of 'tere Mere Sapne', i will keep remembering the lost Neeraj ji very fondly
 
 
 aaj tak saikadon baar sune ja chuke is geet ke rumaan se ab bhala koi kyon baahar nikalnaa chahega? wo jaise niraj ko samajhane kii bhi drushti de gaya, jiske peeche kanpur main chhot gaya unka asafal prem shabd badal-badalakar unki raah roktaa rahaa
 You can easily find scattered beads of his famous eyes on Kanpur in his film songs
 'prem pujari' main unka kahan dekhie- 'na buje he kisi jal se ye jalan', jaise sari alaknandaaon kaa jal bhi prem kii agan ko sheethal karne main naakaafi ho
 He also said very beautifully- 'this is my heart, not a bangle
 
 'hi, what a favor, make your heart bangle for the delicate wrists of the beloved
 
 Then, a new way of defining love is drunken in 'shokhi Geh Jaale Phool Ka Shabab'
 
 
 geeton main tadap, rumaan, ehsaas, jazbaat, dard, bechaini, israar, manuhaar, samarpan or shringaar sabhi kuch ko niraj ke ashiq man ne ibaadat kii tarah saadhaa
 Listen to a song of shyness, 'today drunk my heart, my mind', then you will know how different, large and full of freshness and writing range of poet Neeraj was at that time
 
 o ri kali dard tu tu doli / o re wave wave tu tu payal / o ri river dikha tu darpan / o re kiran odha tu aanchal / Ik jogan hai bani aaj dulhan o Go, my mind
 
 
 
 It is difficult to find another songwriter who creates a makeup like Neeraj, who specializes in creating a beauty that goes beyond dreams
 
 However, Neeraj is not just enough
 wo isse bhi paar jate hai
 By becoming a philosopher
 ek banjaare, sufi yaa qalandar kii tarah kuch aisa rachate, jo hosh uda de
 
 'e bhai zaraa dekhake chalo', 'dil aaj shaayar he, gam aaj nagma he,' 'kaaravaan guzar gaya, ghobaar dekhte rahe', 'suuni-suuni saans ke sitar par' or 'kaal kaa pahiyaa, ghume bhaiya

 The Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PASS) has called a special meeting in Udaipur on 29 August to answer Hardik's opponents where he has gone after getting bail from the Gujarat High Court
 yah samiti naukariyon evam shiksha main patelon ko aarakshan dene kii maang ko lekar muhim chalaa rahi he
 Two days ago, two former Patel colleagues, Chirag and Ketan Patel, accused Hardik in an open letter that indicated a rift in the organization
 patr main donon ne aarope lagaaya tha ki 23 varshiya hardik ne netaa ke rup main ubharne kii apni aakanksha ko tusht karne tathaa uske shuru hone ke salbhar ke andar karodpati banane ke liye is andolan ko aujaar tak istemaal kiya
 On these allegations, Hardik said that Chirag and Ketan are falsely accusing the BJP government of the state
 hardik ne kaha, ‘‘meraa pakkaa maananaa he ki chiraag or kethan rajya sarkaar ke kuch logon ke haathon khel rahe hai jo meri chhavi kharaab kar andolan ko kamjor karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 But they will not succeed because people know that i am immaculate
 patel samudaay ko maaloom he ki main koun hum
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘in aaropon par safai dene kii jarurat nahin he kyonki main jaanata hum ki main galat nahin hum
 This is not new to me
 jab main jail main tha, tab bhi kuch tatwon ne yah daawa kar meri chhavi dhoomil karne kii koshish kii thi ki maine andolan ke madhyam se 80 lakh rupee arjeet kiye
 Finally, i came out as Paksaaf
 ’’ Hardik has gone to Jaipur in Rajasthan after getting bail from the High Court in two sedition cases last month
 jamaanat kii ek shart yah he ki vah agle chah maah tak rajya ke baahar rahenge
 Hardik was charged with sedition in Ahmedabad and Surat
 hardik kareeb nau maheene tak jail main rahe the
 Chirag and Ketan along with him were behind bars for about eight months as they too were accused by the Ahmedabad police in a sedition case
 shahar main 25 agast, 2015 ko paas kii ek raily ke baad gujarat main bade paimaane par hinsa faili thi
 The comments hardik ke kareebi dinesh bambhania ne kaha ki unhone donon ke aaropon kaa karaara jawaab dene ke liye apane mahatvapurn sanyojakon kii udaipur main ek baithak bulaayi he
 Dinesh is also an accused in the sedition case

 hindi ke jumalon ke saath chote parde ke kamedi sho main najar aane vaale bijepi ke purv netaa or beete jamaane ke team india ke opening batsman rahe navjot singh siddhu ek baar phir charchaa main hai
 The speculation market is hot on which side Navjot Singh Sidhu will sit in the upcoming Punjab Assembly elections
 andarkhaane se mili khabaron ke anusaar kabhi team india main navjot singh siddhu ke captain rahe mohammad ajaharuddin ek baar phir unhen team main lene kii koshishon main jute hai
 Although this time the team is not of cricket but of politics
 ajahar unki (siddhu kii) party or congress ke bich gathbandhan ke liye pul kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Today even though the closeness between these two cricketers is increasing, in 1996 there was a sour relationship between the two on the cricket field, which has just ended last year
 cricket ke maidan par kaise panpi khatas?purv cricketer navjot singh siddhu or mohammad ajaharuddin ke bich 1996 main rishte talkh ho gaye the
 The Indian cricket team visited England in 1996
 us daure par ajahar baar baar siddhu kii khinchaai kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, on the day of the third ODI against England at Old Trafford, Sidhu felt that he did not want to be part of this team anymore
 darasal, unhen naa to captain ajahar or naa hi manager sandip patil ne kaha ki wo teesraa vanade nahin khel rahe, balki team ke kuch sadasyon ne bataaya ki dressing room main ek chit lagi he jisapar unhen team se baahar kiye jane kii baat likhi gai he
 Azhar won the toss and took the first batting
 siddhu pad lagaakar batting ke liye taiyaar the
 After this, some members of the team made fun of him and this made Sidhu extremely angry
 siddhu daure ke bich se hi team chhodkar waapas laut gaye
 However, in the month of October last year, Azhar reached the hospital to meet the ailing Sidhu and with this, the reports of estrangement between the two had been going on for the last 19 years
 belt kasi, ab patalun sanbhaalane main lage siddhukptain ajahar ek baar phir cricket team ke puraane openar ko congress ke saath jodne kii kavayad main to lage hai lekin siddhu kaa haath congress ke saath sambhav ho sakegaa yaa nahin yah kahana mushkil hai kyonki punjab congress ke kaddavar netaa amarinder singh par vigat dinon main unhone (siddhu ne) bahut hi chhintakashi bhare bayaan die hai
 On Amarinder, he spoke of supporting Akali leader Badal's family behind the scenes
 apni party ko launch karne ke dauraan unhone yah bayaan diya or kaha ki sahi or galat main se ek kaa chayan karnaa he
 Politics is a mission and not a profession, there is no question of cheating the people of Punjab
 duusari ore amarinder singh ne bhi siddhu ko ek kamedian bataaya or kaha ki aawaaj-e-punjab ‘tanga party’ he
 He even went on to say that Sidhu has no stature among the masses
 siddhu ko bhi yah pataa he ki punjab main congress ke paas amarinder singh se bada netaa nahin he or unke sahare hi aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav kii naiya paar karne kii koshish hogi
 You have to choose between tightening your belt or losing trousers
 yah siddhu kaa ek or jumala he or vartmaan main raajnneeti main unki sthiti bhi kamobesh aisi hi he
 Since leaving BJP, Sidhu's condition is also such that he needs the support of a big party to stay on the political pitch
 aise main unhone belt to kas liya he or patalun sanbhaalane kii kavayad main congress kaa daaman thaamne main lage hai
 The BJP, which does not throw dice left in the hope of hitting a six, can never hope to hit a six
 yah siddhu kaa khaas jumala he or isi andaaj main apane raajnneetik kariyar ke ahm mode par, jabaki unhen rajyasabha sadsy manonith kar diya gaya tha, siddhu ne bijepi kaa daaman chhod diya
 Because of this, he was disillusioned with the party
 bijepi ne 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan siddhu ko punjab ke amritsar se tikat nahin diya
 While he has won the same seat in the Lok Sabha twice before, after leaving the BJP, he defeated the BJP and its allies and the ruling party of Punjab, Akali Dal, in the upcoming assembly elections, asking to have political ties with a similar minded party
 Pledged to lekin yahaan se unke raajnneetik sitare kuch dagamagane lage
 From the beginning of July, there was a lot of talk of his joining the Aam Aadmi Party
 lekin kuch dinon baad hi iskaa nateeja bhi sifer rahaa jab bhitarkhaane se mili khabaron ke mutabik punjab chunaav main ‘aap’ kaa mukhyamantri cheharaa ghoshit kiye jane kii siddhu kii maang ko nakaar diya gaya
 Launching omelette by bursting egg, awaaz-e-punjab Launch without egg boils You cannot make omelette
 ye siddhu kaa ek or jumala he
 On the same lines, on the eighth day of the last month, Navjot Sidhu announced his political party awaaz-e-punjab in association with former Olympian Pargat Singh, amid the confusing equations after quitting BJP and being rejected from AAP
 is dauraan wo kejariwal ke saath lambey samay se chal rahi baatcheet par bhi bole
 He targeted Kejriwal saying that all he needs is 'yes Man' ie yes people
 itnaa hi nahin siddhu ne yah bhi kaha ki kejariwal ne unhen punjab vidhansabha chunaav nahin ladane kii salaah di or badale main unki patni ko mantri banane kii peshkash di
 Only dandruff can be found without effort! Even after launching his party, Sidhu is getting support from another regional party of Punjab
 oktober maheene kii pehali taarikh ko aam aadmi party se nikaale gaye succha singh chhotepur ne apni raajnneetik party apana punjab party (AAP) kii ghoshnaa kii or siddhu ko iskaa netritv karne kaa nimantran bhi diya
 Now Ball is in Sidhu's court, he is still trying to fulfill his political intentions
 unke ek or jumale ke mutabik jivan main koshish kiye bina sirf dendraf mil sakate hai
 What will be the efforts of Sidhu, it will tell the time to come
 unki party kaa gathbandhan congress yaa anya party ke liye kitna kargar sabit hoga is par bhi bahut kuch nirbhar karata he
 AAP, which has occupied Delhi's power and has made its mark in Punjab in the Lok Sabha elections, has left them and the Congress is left to assess their stature
 aise main siddhu kaa raajnneetik kariyar philhal dhimi pich par batting karne ke samaan hota ja rahaa he

 When has the man reached the moon? ab to chand par pani bhi khoj liya gaya he
 Still, if it seems that settling on the moon is just a dream, then it is probably not true
 bas itnaa jaan lijie ki chanda mamaa kaa ghar ab bahut dur nahin he
 After the successful discovery of water on the human settlement on the moon, ISRO has now predicted that 10 years later, human settlement can be settled on the moon
 chand par chota sa bangala banaakar nai duniya basaane kaa khwab ab filmon ke parade se nikalakar bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan yani isro ke vaigyanikon kii ankhon main bhi chamakane laga he
 ISRO scientists are now fighting over how to build a bungalow on the moon
 vaise aadhi mushkil to isro ke mishan chandrayan-ek ne dur kar di he

 These places are a huge crater near the north pole of the moon, where the atmosphere is perfectly fit for human settlement
 chand par maujuud he communication satellitewaise chand par paardarshee iglu main rahanaa bhi kam romaanchak nahin hoga
 Just think that you are in your home on the moon, it is night on the moon
 us vakt dharti par failaa he suraj kaa ujaalaa, tab chand ke angan main dharti vaise hi chamakati nazar aegi, jaise ki dharti se nazar aata he chand
 Right now you can not fight with anyone on the moon by calling, but after settling on the moon, it will be fun that you will be able to call any of your acquaintances and ask about the moon's movement
 chand par phone seva shuru karne main vaigyanikon ko koi dikkat nahin aegi, kyonki iske liye communication satellite pehle se maujuud hai
 It will take 42 days to travel - a problem will surely come in front of the house dwellers on the moon and that is the time it takes to measure the distance of the moon from the earth
 isro ke chandrayan-ek ko kareeb 21 din lage the chand tak pahunchane main
 If spacecraft like Chandrayaan have to travel to the moon, then weekend and two-four days of casual leave will not work, because 42 days will be spent in transit
 haa, agar tab tak chandrayan se bhi zyaada speed vaala antariksh yaan ban gaya, to phir chand kaa chakkar lagane main koi jhanjhat nahin

 enesji ke jin commando ko mumbai ko bachaana he
 Their officers wash their clothes
 biviyon kii saadiyaan sanbhaalane kii duty lagaate hai
 These allegations have been made by a commando himself
 usne sawaal poocha he ki ek jawan ko commando banane main jab sarkaar itnaa paisa kharch karti he to uskaa istemaal kisi afasar ke ghar kii chakri main kyon ho rahaa he
 NSG commando Omprakash Shukla has sent an application to the DG alleging this and has also written a letter to the country's Home Minister
 mumbai ke hamale ke hero enesji commando rahe hai
 Following the attack, a contingent of NSG commandos has been permanently stationed in Mumbai
 om prakaash pehle ardhsainik bal kaa hissaa the
 Then elected to NSG
 tranning lee or mumbai main duty par bhej die gaye
 But now the senior officers want to make the commandos orderly
 ardli yani afasar ke khaane-pine se lekar uske kapade dhone or boot paalish tak kaa kaam karanevaala sahaayak
 But the commandos who came to die for the country are not lost
 om prakaash ne tark he ki sarkaar ne lakhon kharch kar commando banaaya kya afasaro boot polish ke liye
 a commando has a salary of around 18 thousand and he is fit to fight terrorists
 omprakash ko apane major mohammad israel ke ghar or offis main tainaat hone kaa aadesh mila he
 NDTV also tried to talk to Mezar Saheb in this matter, then he refused to recognize the commandos
 omprakash kii daleel he ki wo jis kaam ke liye chunaa hi nahin gaya wo kyon kare
 There have been constant voices on this use of soldiers in the army and paramilitary forces, but Omprakash now wants to fight across
 ab shikaayat enesji ke dector general se kii he
 The big question is whether in the name of Discipline, Major Colonel and big officers will continue to force the soldiers to do so, or will there be a law which can save them from this forced labor

 in pariwaron ke bachche maithili likhnaa, padhanaa va bolnaa bahut kam jaanate hai, kyonki unako maithili kii shiksha nahin mil pai he
 Since our language has a profound effect on a person's personality, this culturally disconnected young generation needs to be taught to speak Maithili
 "mithilalok phandation ne do modeul main paathyakram dizin kiya he
 The first is the Beginners 'course for Beginners' Knowledge, while the Advanced Course is designed to achieve language proficiency
 unhone kaha ki gaiyr-maithili bhashi logon ke liye bhi yahaan avasar he ki ve is bhashaa ko sikhkar mithila kii saanskrithik viraasat se rubaru ho sakate hai
 This will also lead to intercultural interaction
 jha ne kaha ki jagat janani sita kii janmabhumi mithila vaidic kaal se gyaan-vigyaan kaa centre rahi he

 in the guru-shishya tradition

 counselling ke saath hi ham sharir ko is tarah se dhaal sakate hai ki tanaav kaa ham par asar naa ho
 We can do this by learning the art of pranayama, meditation and regular exercise
 " Aggarwal said, "research has revealed that anger, malice and aggression are emerging as new threats to heart diseases

 cabinet kii baithak ke baad bina laal batti kii gaadi main pradhanmantri manmohan singh se milane pahunche kapadaa mantri dayaanidhi maaran ne piem ko istipha saunpa

 DMK chief m Karunanidhi also did not object to this
 maaran par aarope tha ki kapadaa mantri dayaanidhi maaran ne telecom mantri rahete hue ek malaysian company ko phayda pahunchaaya tha
 The CBI said this in its status report submitted to the Supreme Court on Wednesday
 maaran par shaq kii sui isliye he kyonki jab sanchaar mantri the to do saal se zyada vakt tak unke paas license ke liye argiyaan lambit padi rahi
 The question arises as to whether Maran was deliberately giving in to the license? The question is also why the promoter of Aircel put license in his bag immediately after the stake was sold to Maxis Group
 sibiai in tamaam pahaluon par jaanch kar rahi he
 Significantly, Aircel promoter Sivasankaran has repeatedly reiterated that he was forced by Maran to sell the stake

 ahm ye he ki airsel ke pramotor shivashankaran baar baar doharaate rahe hai ki unhen maaran ne hissaa bechney ke liye majaboor kiya tha
 The bench headed by Justice GS Singhvi said in gestures that the condition and direction of the investigation will now be on the questioning of Sivasankaran on July 13
 supreme court ne sibiai ko hidaayat di ki maamle kii taknikiyon or mani trail ke pahaluon ko dekhte hue agar wo chaahe to visheshgyon kii madad le sakati he
 The court also commented, 'we know that there will be efforts to cover up, but we all want the investigation to reach its end
 court ne kaha ki jaanch ko bhale hi saidetrack karne ki koshish kii jaae lekin agency ise prabhavit na ho
 The Supreme Court will now hold the next hearing in the case on July 11

 31 aktubar kii subah jis vakt bhopal central jail se bhaage simi ke aath vichaaradhin aatankwaadiyon kaa encounter chal rahaa tha tab bhopal police control room main jabardast gahamagami thi
 An officer of SP rank was sitting in the control room himself and was ordering the police team from the wireless set
 police control room kii us baatcheet kaa audio vaardaat team ke paas he
 After listening to this conversation, it is clear that the Bhopal Police had decided in advance that not one of those eight should be caught alive
 balki un sabhi kaa kaam tamaam karnaa he
 After listening to the audio of the police control room, there is no doubt or question about the fact that the Bhopal police had already decided to kill the eight accused who had escaped from the jail
 police ne pehle hi tay kar liya tha ki inamen se ek ko bhi jinda nahin pakadana he
 This audio also shows that the Bhopal Police and other teams involved in the operation accidentally opened fire on each other
 lihaaja bich-bich main baar-baar ye massej aata he ki cross firing naa karen
 The most shocking part in the audio is the police team continued firing even after the encounter was over and the eight were killed
 jabaki unhen firing rokane ke liye baar-baar control room se hidaayat di ja rahi thi
 It is not known how many rounds of firing took place, but a total of 25 bullets were fired to the eight undertrials killed in the encounter
 postmortem karne vaale doctor ke mutabik in 25 goliyon main se sirf ek goli aisi thi jo ek ke qamar ke neeche lagi thi
 One bullet hit one's head
 baaki sari kii sari goliyaan aathon ke seene or pet par lagi thim
 Obviously this is possible only when the bullet is shot very close
 jabaki encounter main aisa mumkin nahin hota
 Because the encounter is always from far away

 The Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Ministry of Defense said in its report tabled in the Lok Sabha, "it is disturbing that 1,86,138 bullet-proof jackets have not been procured yet, for them, on October 19, 2009, the Defense Acquisition Council Approval was received and a request for proposal was issued on 7 December 2012 via the capital route

 The lump sum was said by the opposition that the Prime Minister's rally is in the day, which is why the EC has banned the night
 vipaksh jab mamata ke saath aayaa, to unhone bhi twit kar har kisi kaa dhanyavad diya
 Before the election results, this unity of the opposition can raise the concern of the Bharatiya Janata Party, while at the same time it can also put Mamata Banerjee ahead in the main race of opposition leaders
 Thanks and gratitude to@mayawati,@yadavakhilesh,@incindia,@ncbnand others for expressing solidarity and support to us and the people of # Bengal

" " According to an estimate, there are around 20 lakh traders in Delhi which is important from the political equation, hence Aam Aadmi Party has a lot of eye on them

 Questioning his ticket being cut, Udit Raj said that BJP cites an internal survey on ticket distribution
 party ke is internal survey main uttar pashchim dilli seat par jeet kii report saamne ai, iske baavjood meraa tikat kaata gaya
 Udit Raj alleged that my ticket was cut because on April 2, 2018, when Dalits called Bharat Bandh protesting against the Modi government's move to weaken the law, i supported it
 udit raaj ne kaha ki agar main aisa na karata or chup rahata to meraa tikat nahin kaata jaataa
 Udit Raj claimed that the BJP and RSS get a reward for being silent
 unhone ramnath kovind kaa udhaaharan dete hue apni baat ko rakhaa
 Udit Raj said, 'on 20 May 2014 Ramnath Kovind came to me with his biodata
 vivek sonkar iske chashmadid hai
 Kovind ji told me that brother should do something for me
 kyonki bijepi ne ramnath kovind ko 2014 main tikat ke laayak bhi nahin samajha tha jabaki wo tikat chaah rahe the
 But he kept quiet and you saw his reward '
 udit raaj ne kaha ki agar main bhi chup rahata to bijepi ramnath kovind kii tarah hi mujhe bhi koi inaam de detii
 Udit Raj even said that if i had lived peacefully, i would have probably made me PM, but i did not do so and kept raising voice on the issue of Dalits
 yahi vajah rahi ki bijepi ne meraa tikat kaat diya
 What will Udit Raj Udit Raj do now not have the option to contest elections in Delhi
 aise main unhone apni planning kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Udit Raj said that i have said that i do not want anything, i will only campaign
 daliton se bijepi kitni nafrat karti he ye main hi samaj saktaa hum or agar daliton ko ye pataa lag jaae to ek bhi vot dalit bijepi ko na de
 Udit Raj, while clarifying on joining Congress, said that i never said anything against Congress while staying in BJP
 aap google kar lijie
 This meant my silent support for the Congress
 ab udit raaj ne kaha ki uttar pashchim seat par bijepi kii jamaanat jabt hogi

 The problem is that this condition of Team India is constantly happening
 khaaskar videshi pichon par bhartiya ballebaazon ko kai baar is tarah kii chunauti kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Indian bowlers have largely failed to curb opposition batsmen on foreign pitches
 videshi pich par ek baar phir bhartiya gendbaaj phir pit gaye
 This story is not new, but it is surprising that the story of failure in bowling is being repeated in the same way
 gendbaaz vahi galatiyaan duhraate rahe hai
 Sometimes making short balls, sometimes not using creases, sometimes trying to get the lower order batsmen out with a bad bouncer - there are many mistakes that bowlers have been repeating match-by-match, trying to take lessons on the field
 But have not seen team india ke gendbaazon ne kai mauqon par naa sirf haath main ai baazi haath se nikal jane di, balki zyaadaatar mauqon par itane ran lutaae ki ballebaazon ke liye utane ran batorna aasaan nahin rahaa
 In the last four years, from 2011 till now, the Indian team played two dozen Tests on foreign land, but despite so much experience on foreign land, there was no improvement in India's record

 zaahir he isaki vajah yah he ki is dauraan team videshi zamin par kahin or jeet hasil karne se dur hi rahi
 In all these matches, there were many reasons for the defeat on the foreign land, but a big reason was that the host opposition teams scored many times more than 500, reaching the Indian batsmen
 pichley chaar saal main videshi jameen par khele gaye 24 test maichon main maujuuda test ko milakar vipakshi team ne 12 baar 500 se bada score khadaa kiya
 Out of these, in ten Tests, Team India suffered a loss, while one match was a draw

 filhal yah daawa nazar aata he, agar aisa sachmuch ho paata he to melbern main team india itihaas kii ore kadam rakhegi, lekin itihaas or bhartiya team ke pradarshan ke bich faasla philhal bada nazar aata he

 Joshi objected to making caste the norm of the poverty line and said that poverty is not tied to the boundaries of caste, community and religion
 unhone sarkaar se spasht karne ko kaha ki garibi ke aankalan kaa aadhaar jati hogi yaa aarthik sthati
 He said that by making caste a criterion of poverty, there is also an attempt to avoid the determination of BPL
 unke anusaar jatigat janaganana 2012 tak puri hogi, jiskaa matlab he ki kam se kam tab tak garibi rekha ke neeche rahane waalon kaa aankalan nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 Meanwhile, amidst all-round criticisms about the definition of poverty, Ahluwalia tried to separate himself from the controversy
 unhone kaha ki samaaj ke vanchit virgon ko sabsidi dene main nyaayalay main prastut aankadon ko aadhaar nahin banaaya gaya he
 He offered his clarification saying that the idea of definition of poverty is not his own
 unhone kaha ki in aankadon ke istemaal se samaaj ke pichde tabakon ko sarkari sahaayta se vanchit karne kaa koi iraadaa nahin he

 vanshavaad bhartiya raajnneeti kii hakeekat he
 This was agreed by Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi last month while answering a question in Berklee University of America
 rahul ne kaha tha ki vastav main bharat main adhiktar partiyon main ye samasya he, isliye sirf ham par nahi jaaie
 How much dynasty dominates among Congress leaders is known only by looking at the list of candidates released by the party for the Himachal Pradesh Assembly elections
 himachal pradesh kii raajnneeti kii baat kii jaae to vahaan vanshavaad koi nai baat nahin he
 Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh's family itself is its biggest example
 pehle mukhyamantri ne 2013 main mandi loksabhaa seat par khud ke istipha dene kii vajah se hue upachunaav main patni pratibha singh ko congress se tikat dilvaaya
 Pratibha Singh won the by-election, but in the next year in 2014, she had to face defeat in front of bjp's Ramswaroop Sharma
 mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ne 9 november ko hone vaale himachal pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main bete vikramaditya singh ko shimla gramin seat se tikat dilava kar phir vanshavaad ko tarjeeh di he
 However, Vikramaditya does not consider the party ticket to be the result of dynasty
 unke mutabik vah himachal pradesh yuva congress ke adhyaksh hai or unhone 5 saal shimla gramin kshetra ke logon kii seva kii he, isi vajah se vidhansabha kshetra main unka kaaphi janaadhar he
 It is not that dynasty is confined only to Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh's clan
 congress ne pradesh main is baar vikramaditya samet saat aise ummidavaaron ko tikat diya he jo maujuuda yaa purv mantriyon ke bete yaa beti hai
 The Congress has fielded Ashish Butel, son of Himachal Legislative Assembly Speaker and state Congress leader Brij Bihari Lal Butel, from Palampur
 ashish bootel tikat milane ko party alaakaman kaa aashirwad maanate hai
 According to him, getting a party ticket is not dynastic
 virbhadra singh cabinet main swasthya mantri kaul singh thakur kii beti champa thakur ko mandi vidhansabha seat se congress kaa tikat mila he
 When asked about dynasticism with Champa Thakur, he said that he has a separate family due to being married, so getting him a party ticket is no familyism
 vaise bhi meraa vidhansabha kshetra pita se alag he or sasuraal main padataa he
 The party has fielded Aditya Vikram Singh, son of late Karan Singh from Banjar Vidhan Sabha constituency of Kullu
 karan singh virbhadra singh cabinet main mantri the or unki mrityu ke baad unke bete aditya vikram singh par party ne daanv khelaa he
 When Aditya was talked about dynasty, he advised the BJP, who questioned the Congress tickets, to peek into his campaign
 aditya ne kaha, "bhartiya janata party ke netaaon ko pehle apane girebaan main jhaankna chahie
 When a doctor's son can become a doctor, a lawyer's son can become a lawyer, then why can't a leader's son become a leader
 agar usamen kaabiliyat he to use party kaa ummidavaar banaae jane main dikkat kya he
 BJP leaders who accused the Congress may have forgotten that when the BJP government was in the state, Anurag Thakur, son of the then Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal, also became an MP
 "chah baar loksabhaa saansad rahe congressi netaa krishnadutt sultanpuri ke bete vinod sultanpuri ko bhi congress ne tikat dekar kasauli vidhansabha chunaav kshetra se maidan main utaara he
 Vinod says on the question of Sultanpuri dynasty, "it doesn't matter who has a son or whose daughter is a daughter
 jeet is baat par nirbhar karti he ki usne kitni mehnat kii he
 i have contested elections before and i am still contesting elections
 pichhlaa chunaav haar gaya tha lekin is chunaav main main jeet darj karuunga
 The person who has the right must fight the election
 "congress sarkarmen vidhansabha upaadhyaksh rahe ram nath sharma ke bete vivek sharma ko oona ke kutlehad vidhansabha kshetra se party tikat diya gaya he
 Vivek also does not consider party ticket as dynasty
 congresski ore se maujuuda mantriyon or purv mantriyon ke beti-beton ko tikat die jane ke baad bijepi ko bhi nishaanaa saadhane kaa mauka mil gaya he
 Satpal Satti, president of Himachal Pradesh BJP, says, "congress has always been the mother of familism and corruption, it has always promoted familism
 " The recession in the country is knocking

 It is 71 and this is the third week of consecutive falls
 ab tak ginaae gaye andeshe to phir bhi dikhne or naaptul karne laayak hai
 Apart from these, there is no attention towards unemployment
 jabaki dedh saal pehle raajnneetik badlaav kaa maahaul banane ke liye in berozegaar yuvakon ko hi sabase zyada ummiden bandhai gai thim
 Alam is that in the last one and a half years, an army of at least two crore unemployed youth has already been added to the five crore unemployed
 idhar desh kii jansankhya main 65 fisad yuvakon kii sankhya hone ko jis tarah apni beshkeemtee dharohar bataae jane kaa prachaar is samay ho rahaa he use kab tak prachaarit kiya ja sakegaa? Finally, the question may arise that if the circumstances of the country are really like this, then what can be the reasons for the amazing certainty from the government and the administration? The answer may be that some governments think feel good is also a strategy
 bhojan kaa ek tihaai hissaa daalen hai
 All the measures announced on the increase in the prices of pulses from double to two and a half times in two and a half months have not been shown yet
 godaamon par chhapemari ke baad un daalon ko upabhoktaaon tak saste daam par pahunchane kaa kaam yudhstar par pataa nahin kyon shuru nahin ho paaya
 Whereas pulses do not last more than two months
 unamem ghun laganaa shuru ho jaataa he
 The practice of keeping pulses in cold storage to sustain them has not yet begun
 or phir daalon ke daamon main dogani dhai guni badhotaree se mache haahaakaar ke baad ise jamaa rakhana itnaa samvedansheel ho gaya ki vyapaaree kam se kam daalon ke vyapaar se zyada munaafe ke laalach main ab bilkul nahin padana chaahate
 The sensational defeat of the ruling party at the Center in the Bihar elections is yet to be analyzed, but the two major reasons behind this defeat have been identified by the media as Dal and Dadri
 haarane ke baad bhi or chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhi
 But showing itself very vigilant and attentive, what kind of heap was delivered by the government which came to power one and a half years ago
 sirf tab hi nahin, balki musalasal abhi tak
 Inflation in pulses is such a serious matter that pulses will not prove to be just a seasonal issue
 jab krishi utpaadan kaa hisaab-kitaab dekha jayega, to aankade chaunkaane vaale aa sakate hai
 Now only the words of arhar, moong and urad have been heard
 isaki kami kii bharpai ke liye chhapemari or videshon se aayaat ke prachaar ke sahare tadarth rup se baat ai gai karne kii koshish hui he
 What happened in this affair? It is also important to discuss this
 jab daal ke thok vyapaariyon se daalon ke vyapaar yaa aadhat kii baarikiyaan jaanane kii koshish kii gai, to bade dur kii baat pataa chali
 It was asked whether there is any alternative to pulses with about one-third share in Indian food
 jawaab tha ki arhar, mung or urad ke mahange hone ke baad duusari sasti daalen vikalp banakar ubhari hai
 Of these, there are two main ones - Chana and Rajma
 lekin chanaa bhi mahangaai kii chapet main aayaa he
 Rajma remains raajma par zyada asar kyon nahin hua? yah sawaal khush hone kii bachaay had se zyada chaunkaane vaala he
 The firm figures of Rajma's production and its trade are not currently in hand
 phir bhi is charchaa main yah jaankaree mili ki ab tak madras, punjab or jammu kaa raajma hi mashhoor tha
 Especially the Rajma of Madras the highest
 lekin mahangaai kii afratfari main achaanak china kaa raajma bhartiya bazaar main bad gaya
 It is inexpensive and dominates all varieties of Desi Rajma
 sastepan ke kaaran itani dabish ban gai ki desi raajma paidaa karne vaale bhartiya kisaanon ko laagat nikaalane ke laale pad rahe hai
 Stuck on Rajma in the discussion of the economic situation of a country with a population of one hundred and thirty crores may seem strange to some, but this new trend in the Indian market is pointing towards a dangerous trend in the near future
 khaastaur par tab to or zyada jab hamane 'mek in india' ke naare se badi ummiden laga rakhi hon
 If this condition of the agricultural produce of the agricultural country is happening, then what will be the thing, which we will be able to produce at the cost of the global market
 tippaniyan It was said that pulses are the exception and this will not affect inflation figures

 When an attempt was made to know the specifics of the pulses trade or aadhata from the wholesale traders of pulses, a great distance was known
 poocha yah gaya tha ki bhartiya bhojan main lagbhag ek tihaai hisse vaali daalon kaa kya koi vikalp bhi he
 The answer was that other expensive pulses have emerged as an alternative after arhar, moong and urad are expensive
 inamen do pramukh hai- chanaa or raajma
 But gram is also vulnerable to inflation
 bachataa he raajma
 Why was there not much effect on Rajma? This question is more shocking than the extent of happiness
 raajma ke utpaadan or iske vyapaar ke pakke aankade haal philhal haath main nahin hai
 Nevertheless, it was learned in this discussion that till now the Rajma of Madras, Punjab and Jammu was famous
 khaastaur par madras kaa raajma sabase zyada
 But in the wake of inflation, China's rule suddenly increased in the Indian market
 yah sasta he or isane desi raajma kii sabhi kismon par dabish bana di
 Due to cheapness, it has become so pressing that Indian farmers who produce indigenous kidney beans are forced to extract the cost
 ek sau tees karod kii aabaadi vaale desh kii aarthik sthiti kii charchaa main raajma par atakana kuch logon ko ajeeb lag saktaa he, lekin bhartiya bazaar main ai yah nai pravriti nikat bhavishya ke khatarnaak rukh kii taraf ishaara kar rahi he
 Especially more so when we have high expectations with the slogan 'make in India'
 agar krishi pradhan desh ke krishi utpaada kii yah haalat ho rahi ho, to vah koun si cheez hogi, jiskaa utpaadan ham vaishvik bazaar ke daam par kar paaenge

 Retail inflation 4 in October, despite the steep fall in crude oil prices in the international market

 It is said that when Mahadev is in anger, he begins to perform Tandava
 iske alaava unke tandav ke chalate samast sristi kaa bhi vinaash ho saktaa he
 But let us tell, Tandava is not done only in anger but also on the occasions of happiness
 tandav ke kai swaroop hote hai or isse judi anek kathaayen hai
 Let us tell you today the meaning of the Tandava of Shiva and the stories related to it - there is a belief that there are two main forms of Mahadev
 ek hota he samadhi or doosraa hota he tandav
 Now two stories are widely discussed in connection with Lord Shiva's Tandava
 ek baar mata sati bhagwaan shiv ke saath apane pita daksh dwaara yojit havan main hissaa lene ai thim
 Seeing Bholenath being insulted there, Mother Sati jumped into the fire and committed self-immolation
 is ghatana se mahadev itane krodhit ho gaye ki unhone rudra tandav shuru kar diya
 Due to that orgy, a holocaust-like situation arose on the whole creation
 tandav se judi ek or katha he jo bahut rochak he
 In that legend it is claimed that Lankeshwar Ravana started Shiva Tandava
 ek baar ravan ne bhagwaan shiv se milane ke liye lanka se kailash kii ore kooch kiya
 He continued to remember Bholenath all the way and sang his praises
 parantu ye wo samay tha jab mahadev apane dhyaan main magn the jiske chalate unhen is baat kaa ahsaas hi nahin hua ki unka parambhakt unki pratiksha kar rahaa tha
 Ravan was hurt by this and lifted the entire Kailash mountain from his hands
 is halchal ke chalate mahadev kaa dhyaan bhang ho gaya or unhone krodh main aakar apana panja kailash parvat ke upar rakh diya
 Now Ravana's hand got buried under that mountain and he started to suffer in pain
 use uski galati kaa ahsaas hua or uskaa ghamand tut gaya
 Now to appease Bholenath, Ravana started singing Shiva Tandava Stroth
 bataa den, is sangeet ke madhyam se mahadev kii mahanata kaa bakhaan kiya gaya he
 Hearing such beautiful music for himself, Mahadev became pleased with Ravana and lifted his paw from the top of the mountain
 isliye lankesh ravan ko shiv tandav kaa rachayita kaha jaataa he
 Orgy is also done in happiness
 Bholekai people have the misconception that Mahadev only does the Tandava in anger
 jab mahadev behad prasann hote hai, tab bhi ve tandav karte hai
 Let me tell you, in happiness, Shiva does Anand Tandava, which makes the whole environment beautiful
 iske alaava, tripura, sandhya, samaara, kaali, uma bhi tandav ke prakaar he jo mahadev dwaara vibhinn avasthaa main kiye jate hai
 a summary of the entire creation is contained within the Tandava
 ye mrityu, janm, vinaash, rachana sabhi ko darshata he

 There was a time when Amar Singh used to speak in Samajwadi Party (SP) and Mulayam Singh used to look at him with his every decision
 lekin vakt badla to unki siyasat kaa rang bhi feekaa padataa chalaa gaya
 Amar Singh was shown the way out of the party after the SP took over the reins of Akhilesh Yadav
 netaji ke khasmkhas rahe ye thakur netaa ab pradhanmantri narendra modi ke fain ban chuke hai
 The result of this is that they have started eating saffron color a lot
 ravivaar ko amar singh lakhanu main piem modi ke kaarykram main bhagava libaas main najar aae
 After this, there was also speculative speculation about his joining BJP
 sapa ke purv netaa aurarajyasabha saansad amar sinhako ek daur main mulaayam singh yadav kaa sabase kareebi netaa mana jaataa tha
 Without Amar Singh's wishes, the leaf did not move in the SP
 loksabhaa or vidhansabha main tikat se lekar mantri banane tak kaa faisla ve karte the
 Netaji used to call him his brother
 amar singh ke chalate mulaayam singh yadav ne raaj babbar ko party main sidline to ajam khan ko party se baahar kar diya tha
 During Mulayam's time, he used to take up the task of lobbying for the party in Delhi and establishing better rapport with the media
 yahi vajah thi ki ve mulaayam ke aankh ke taare the
 Time changed and the political leadership of SP came into the hands of Akhilesh Yadav, then Amar Singh started knocking in the eyes of the party
 haalat ye hui ki akhilesh ne unhen party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Since being expelled from the SP, the saffron color of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has started growing on Amar Singh
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii nitiyaan bhi unhen pansad aane lagi
 This is the reason why the time-barred Amar Singh has started reading ballads in the pride of Modi
 amar singh ravivaar ko lakhanu main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kaarykram main maujuud the
 Amar Singh sat in the first line wearing saffron colored kurta at the event
 modi ne amar singh kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha ki yahaan amar singh baithe hai, ve sabaki history nikaal denge
 During the foundation stone of Rs 60 thousand crore industry projects, PM Modi, while referring to Amar Singh, targeted the corporate lobbying behind the scenes during opposition governments

 In this conversation he said, 'modiji likes us

 'amar Singh said that the character of Modiji is such that with whom he belongs
 mard kii tarah rakhte hai
 They do not look big or small
 jabaki desh ke tamaam netaa hai jo poojipatiyon se chanda lete hai, lekin unke saath rishte jaahir nahin karte hai
 There is a difference in their actions, but not Modi's
 bijepi main shaamil hone ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki amit shah ko adhikaar he
 i am a Kshatriya, do no work in secret, the day you have to join BJP will go to press conference

 During Rajiv Gandhi's time, he became close to the then Chief Minister Veer Bahadur
 iske baad amar singh saal 1995 main mulaayam ke kareeb aae or ek saal ke bheetar hi donon ek duusare ke behad kareeb aa gaye
 The credit for bringing corporate culture to the Samajwadi Party and the entry of Bollywood leaders goes to Amar Singh
 sapa main entry ke ek saal baad hi mulaayam ne amar singh ko rajyasabha bhej diya
 He was subsequently elected to the Rajya Sabha in 2002, 2008 and 2016 as well
 amar singh khud ko mulaayam kaa chota bhai or sevak bataate rahe hai
 In 2010, there was a rift between the Yadav family and Amar Singh over the defeat of Gajnambar in 2010, sp's defeat in Firozabad by-election in 2009
 is chunaav main mulaayam singh ne apni bahu dimple yadav ko tikat diya tha
 After the defeat, Amar Singh said that the SP was overwhelmed by his superstition
 janvari, 2010 main amar singh ne mahasachiv samet party ke teen padon se yah kehete hue istipha de diya tha ki ab wo apane swasthya kaa khyaal rakhana chaahate hai
 However, it was said at the time that Singh was unhappy with his declining stature in the party
 das dinon tak istife par chup rahane vaale mulaayam ne baad main unka istipha sweekaar kar liya
 The formation of the National Lok Manch Party was not made even by forming its own party
 After the resignation, SP chief Mulayam dismissed Amar Singh from the party
 amar singh kuch dinon tak raajnneetik rup se niskriy rahe, haalanki kuch hi dinon baad unhone apni party 'rashtriya lok manch' banaai
 They did not get any benefit from it
 iske baad 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav unhone areldi jwine kar liya or fatehpur sikri sansadeey seat se maidan main utre lekin wo jeet nahin paae
 After this, his closeness with Mulayam Singh increased again

 raksha utpaadan kii yogyata badhaane ke liye japan, dakshin korea, taiwan, america, israel or europea union ke kuch chuninda deshon ko bhagidaar banaaya ja saktaa he
 Trade with diplomacy: India's security and foreign policy challenges and priorities are evident for five years
 kootneeti, vyapaar or nivesh ke protsaahan ko saath-saath chalanaa hoga
 Like Australia and Canada, India should bring its foreign policy, foreign trade and foreign cooperation under one ministry and this ministry can be named as Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade
 is mantralay main civil seva ke saamaanya adhikariyon ko niyukt karne kii jagah aise adhikariyon ko niyukt karnaa chahie jo videshi maamalon main nipun hon or vyapaar ko badhaava dene kii ichha rakhte hon
 Such officers should include professional diplomats as well as private sector business executives for short-term tenures
 hamen padosi deshon ke saath aarthik sahyog ko zyada praathamikta deni chahie
 Economic partnership with the oil rich Gulf countries and Iran, along with our eastern neighbors with a good economy including China, should be increased so as to promote investment and energy cooperation
 afghanistan ko lekar ek phydemand niti banane kii sakht jarurat he, kyonki bharat afghanistan kii sena ko majboot banane ke prati zyada ruchi dikhaa rahaa he
 By adding diplomacy to foreign trade, national interests will not be ignored in any way
 niti-nirmaan main senanai sarkaar agar bharat ke prati antarrashtriya vishwaas phir se kaayam karnaa chaahati he to use yah sanket dena hoga ki vah satta main aane ke turant baad arthvyavastha ko teji se patari par waapas laana chaahati he
 The bureaucracy of the Ministry of Defense on security issues has been against any changes that affect its status
 naresh chandra samiti kii kuch siforishein ab aam ho gai hai
 It is no longer a secret that the control structure of our strategic nuclear forces has not been satisfactory by not having a full-time chairman among the staff committee heads
 duniya ke kisi bhi desh main sena or vibhinn vishyon kii jaankaree rakhane vaali naukarshahi itani sakhti se alag nahin kii gai he
 The government should show willingness to change this structure and by the end of the first year of its tenure, the Army should also give a clear indication of its involvement in defense policy-making
 pehle chah maheene ke bheetar raksha udyog main videshi nivesh kii bhoomika main nitigat badlaavon, raksha or antariksh udyog main teji se vruddhi ke liye videshi saajheedaaron tathaa hamaare apane nijee kshetra ko aamantrit karne kii disha main kadam badhanaa chahie
 Increase There is no need to make any unexpected announcement in the matter of regional foreign trade policy
 rashtradhyakshon ke saath telephone par apni pehali baatcheet main pradhanmantri or videsh mantri ko phir se yahi baat doharaani chahie ki ve padosiyon ke saath shantipurna sambandh or aarthik sahyog badhanaa chaahate hai
 It is necessary that within the first 100 days, studies should be started on the change in policies to make the country more investor and business friendly and these policies should be implemented within a year
 pradhanmantri ko apane kaarykaal ke pehle hi varsh main prastaavit nitigat badlaavon kii charchaa apane kshetreey or global manchon jaise ji-20, east asia summit or asian par kerani chahie
 This can provide direct feedback to the Prime Minister about his proposed policies and can help him to increase the monetary trade
 china-pakistan se baat hopakistan ke saath ab tak chali aa rahi jubaani jang se bachanaa chahie
 We should try to cooperate and build good relations with him
 padosi desh main shanti bharat ke liye behatar rahegi isliye vahaan kii naagarik sarkaar kaa sahyog karnaa chahie
 Promotion of democracy in Pakistan will bring prosperity in the country and it will be better for India
 lekin pakistan agar aatankwaad ko badhaava dena jari rakhata he to uske liye prabhavi kadam uthaane ke liye bhi taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 There is little chance of finding a solution soon to end the border dispute with China
 lekin is samay china jis tarah se padosiyon ke saath samudri kshetra ke vivaad main ulajh hua he, use dekhte hue vah bharat ke saath seemaa par tanaav badhanaa nahin chahega
 Negotiations with China on the border dispute to create a lasting power balance in Asia, as well as its neighboring countries such as Japan and Vietnam, and efforts to increase strategic and economic cooperation with the US

 Speaking on this much talked about controversy, Kapil said, i am a bit confused about this issue

 So what is the reason? The Rajput organization has raised its voice against the film, saying that the film hurts the sentiments of their community

 lekin aap kisi kaa sir nahin kaat sakate
 On one hand, it is said that Deepika has illuminated the name of the country
 saath hi mahila shashaktikaran kii baat bhi karte hai
 These types of threats hurt people
 padmavati kii relies par unhone kaha, sensor board ko film ko dekhni chahie
 If they find something objectionable, they can find a solution

 After these constant threats, the security of Bhansali and Deepika has been increased

 Former Jharkhand Chief Minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief Shibu Soren denied that he had said anything in support of the Maoists in Kolkata on Wednesday
 shibu sorain ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘media ne meri baat samajhi nahin or meri baat ko tod marod kar pesh kiya he
 i have not said a word in support of the Maoists
 ’ kolkata main shibu sorain ne kaha tha ki vah maovadiyon ke andolan evam sangharsh ke samarthak hai sirf vah unki hinsa ko uchit nahin maanate hai
 Shibu Soren said that there might have been some misunderstanding between the questions asked by journalists in Kolkata in Bengali and English and in my Hindi answers
 samvaadadaata sammelan main maujuud rajya ke swasthya mantri or jhamumo netaa hemlaal murmu ne shibu sorain kii baton ko or spasht karte hue bataaya ki kolkata main vah bhi guruuji ke saath maujuud the or vahaan guru ji ne aisi koi baat nahin kahi thi
 Murmu said that Guruji only said that he supports the people's movement but he does not support those who commit any kind of violence
 unki baton ko patrakaron ne shaayad thik se samajha nahin
 He also accused the Left Government of West Bengal through the 'harmad Vahini' for atrocities on the poor minorities and backward tribes
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki garib adivasee to ‘harmad vahini’ or ‘aaparishan green hunt’ ke bich aise funs gayi hai jaise vah kune or khai ke bich main fanse hon
 Shibu Soren made it clear that he never said that there are no Maoists in West Bengal, but the only thing is that poaching only becomes poor and not Maoists
 unhone kaha ki pashchim bengal ke rajyapapal se milakar jhamumo ne apni chintaaon se unhen avgat kara diya he or unase aagrah kiya he ki vah yah sunishchit karen ki garibon or adivaasiyon ke khilaaf koi karrwai na ho
 He said that he has demanded the Governor to give a grant amount of ten lakh rupees to the families of innocent people killed in 'harmad Vahini' and 'green Hunt' and eight lakh to seriously injured and five lakh rupees to the injured
 unhone is mudde par trinmul congress se koi baatcheet karne kii afvaah se inkaar kiya or kaha ki is maamle main hamaari raay alag he
 The Supreme Court has given the central government one last chance in the NRI voting case
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne centre ko 21 july tak yah bataane ko kaha he ki enarai ko matdaan kaa adhikaar dene ke liye sarkaar sirf niyamon main badlaav karegi yaa phir act main badlaav karnaa hoga
 Significantly, in 2014, the Central Government said in the Supreme Court that it has approved the recommendation of the Election Commission, which talks about giving the right of vote to nris

 That is, they should be given an e-ballot and send it back from the post later, for this all nris should register in their embassy
 philhal sarkaar ne kaha tha ki is prakriya main kuch vakt lagegaa, kyonki iske liye maujuuda kanoon main badlaav se lekar videsh mantralay se vichaar sambandhi kadam uthaae jane hai
 Also, a committee has been formed to implement it
 philhal supreme court ne sarkaar ko aath hafte kaa vakt diya he

 yani unhen i ballat diya jaae or wo baad main post se ise waapas bhejein, iske liye sabhi enarai apane duutavas main register karaae
 At present, the government had said that this process will take some time, because for this, the changes in the existing law, from the Ministry of External Affairs, are to be considered
 saath hi ise lagu kiya jaae iske liye ek cameti bana di gai he
 At present, the Supreme Court has given the government eight weeks
 philhal sarkaar ne kaha tha ki is prakriya main kuch vakt lagegaa, kyonki iske liye maujuuda kanoon main badlaav se lekar videsh mantralay se vichaar sambandhi kadam uthaae jane hai
 Also, a committee has been formed to implement it
