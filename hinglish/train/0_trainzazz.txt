 Boland made his international debut on Tuesday in the Napth ODI and conceded only 12 runs in the first four overs but after that the batsmen taught him a tough lesson and finally his bowling analysis was no wicket for 74 runs in ten overs
 unke aakhri do overon main bharat ne 30 ran batore
 Rohit Sharmane broke the record of Sir Vivian Richards by scoring 171 not out in this match
 boland ne kaha ki vah deth overon main kuch yarker ko sahi jagah par pich nahin kara paae or adhik maichon main khilne se vah isamen sudhaar kar lenge
 The Victoria bowler said, "I could not pitch a couple of balls to the right place by some margin
" lekin jab kisi aise ballebaaj ke liye gendbaaji kar rahe ho jo 150 ran (rohit) bana chukaa ho to phir vah aisi gendon par chakka jadega

 He has 12,271 runs and 38 centuries to his name
 unke baad england ke elistare cook kaa number aata he jinhone 9,000 ran or 27 shatak lagaae hai
 The star batsman will hardly break Sachin Tendulkar's record of 15,921 runs and 51 Test centuries but he has 11 double centuries to his name and he is close to matching Don Bradman's record of 12 double centuries
 maithyuj ne is baat kaa khandan kiya ki srilanka kii gaale main pakistan ke haathon das wicket kii haar ke kaaran sangakaara ne sanyas kaa faisla taala
 He said, 'he was talking with the selectors before the series started
 meraa maananaa he ki kumaar ne yah faisla karne adhikaar hasil kiya he ki unhen kab sanyas lenaa chahie
 He has served Sri Lanka for the last several years and whenever he retires he will miss a lot
 maithyuj ne kaha, ‘lekin ab yuva khilaadi kumaar or mahela (jayavardhane) kii jagah lene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 It is not easy but they have a good chance of earning a name
 jayavardhane ne pichley saal test or tii20 cricket se sanyas le liya tha

 He said, 'we want to change Uttar Pradesh
 mujhe gussa aata he ki baaki hindustan aage bad rahaa magar upi peeche ho rahaa he
 Taking a dig at Mayawati, Rahul said, "mayawati ji said last evening that she never called NREGA a non-essential plan, but the truth is that she said such thing at a rally in Lucknow on October 9, 2007

 The Foreign Minister has made a very important point that to counter terrorism, we have to break the old equation
 moh tyaagane honge or ahsaanon ko bhulaanaa hoga

 kya inaki baton main bharat pakistan ko lekar koi chintaa he? Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said that terrorists are killing people everywhere

 18 sitambar ko udi sena camp par aatanki hamalaa hua tha
 But when the United Nations session begins two days later, none of the countries in India's neighboring countries speak out loudly about terrorism
 bade desh bhi nazarandaaz kar dete hai
 While it is being claimed in India that many countries of the world are with India against terrorism
 america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ne to apane neuyork main hue aatanki hamale kaa zikr nahin kiya
 9 / 11 was not mentioned, while Sushma Swaraj mentioned both these incidents
 america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ke bhaashan main aatankwaad kaa bahut hi kam zikr he
 He did not even mention the incident in New York, while Sushma Swaraj mentioned the terrorist incident there
 baraak obama ne itnaa bhar kaha ki aatankwaadi network soshal media kaa istamaal kar naujavaanon ko bahala rahe hai
 Are inciting people against Muslims and innocent migrants
 teen chaar line main hi baraak obama ne aatankwaad par apni baat samet di
 He definitely said that we are seeing that many governments are silencing journalists
 asahmati ko kuchal rahi hai
 i want to say very politely that after reading the speeches of the heads of the seven eight countries, it seemed that this much publicized platform of the United Nations is nothing but a provocative speech
 aap yuan kii website par jaakar in bhaashanon ko padhakar apana nirnay bana sakate hai
 Nowhere will you find such a magnificent collection of simple and superficial speeches
 agar bharat kii videsh mantri kaa bhaashan nahin hota to is par baat ho sakati thi ki sanyukt raashtra kii is sabha main die gaye saikadon bhaashan kaa matlab kya he
 Bangladesh did not even name India, while India's foreign minister took the name of terrorist attacks in Dhaka and Kabul

 sena ko upkarnon se las karnaa hoga taaki ve inkaa muqabla kar saken
 France urges the United Nations that for how long we will continue to speak of condemnation and sympathy in case of a terrorist attack against the Allies
 agar france hamale kii ninda ko khanaapurti nahin bananaa chahta tha to kam se kam udi main hue aatanki hamale kaa zikr kar saktaa tha
 It was being projected as a big success in India that France has also strongly condemned it
 saaf he aatankwaad par bharat akele kii ladaai lard rahaa he, baaki desh khanaapurti kar rahe hai
 For them, fighting against terrorism means more than installing CCTV
 britain kii pradhanmantri ne somalia se aatankwaad bhagane main apane desh kii bhoomika kaa lanbaa gungan kiya or kaha ki aaj aatankwaad ke jis khatare kaa ham saamana kar rahe hai wo kisi ek desh se nahin aata he

 Pathankot, Bahadur Ali and Uri
 bahadur ali hamaare kabze main ek aatankwaadi he jiskaa qaboolnamaa ek zindaa saboot he ki pakistan seemapar aatankwaad main shaamil he
 Finally, the Foreign Minister went on to say that since 1996 India has been demanding a detailed discussion and resolution on terrorism, the United Nations Assembly has not reached it till date
 videsh mantri ne kaha ki ham aaj tak koi antarrashtriya maanak nahin bana sake, jiske tahat antkavaadiyon ko sazaa di ja sake yaa unka pratyrpan ho sake
 Kulmilkar's speeches i read, Sushma Swaraj spoke very clearly on terrorism
 bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ne videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko tag karte hue twit kiya he ki 'videsh mantri ko badhai, sanyukt raashtra kii aam sabha main vyapak vaishvik muddon par thos, prabhavi or spasht rup se apni baat rakhane ke liye
 ' twit angrezi main tha, maine anuwaad kar bataaya he
 Congress has not found the Foreign Minister's speech effective
 congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala kaa twit he ki sushamaa swaraj ke bhaashan se niraashaa hui he
 Why Sushma Swaraj, who has been hesitant to call Pakistan a terrorist nation, had responded to the four-point resolution of peace by Nawaz Sharif in this meeting
 kaha tha ki hamen chaar bindu kii zarurat hi nahin he
 Just leave terrorism and sit and talk
 kerala main pradhanmantri ne pakistan se yuddh kii jagah milakar garibi, berojgaare or kuposhan ke khilaaf yuddh kii baat kahi he lekin pakistan ko alag thalag karne kii baat bhi kahi he
 Is this speech of Sushma Swaraj an aggressive step in that direction? bangladesh kii pradhanmantri shaikh hasina ne kaha ki aatankwaadi har jagah logon ko maar rahe hai

 saujany- Newsflicks The Shiv Sena, which is part of the NDA government at the Center, has questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi about Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Balochistan through the mouthpiece 'saamana'
 sampadakeey lekh main balooch netaaon par hui karrwai kaa zikr karte hue party ne likhaa he ki aisa bharat or modi kaa samarthan karne par hua he, to kya ab unhen mukt karwaane ke liye pioke main sarkaar sena bhejegi?buudhvaar ke ank menshivsenaane likhaa he, 'piem modi kaa samarthan balooch netaaon ko baari pad rahaa he
 a case of treason is being filed against them
 unhen jail kii hawa khaani pad rahi he
 What will Modi do now? In order to free the leaders, Pakistan will enter the army in occupied Kashmir or will protest against the oppression on the Baloch leaders and will reject it
 'pakistan ke atyaacharon se chaahate hai mukti'saamana'main aage likhaa gaya he, 'modi ke bayaan kaa balooch netaaon ne swaagat kiya tha
 Pakistan was reprimanded by Prime Minister Modi on 15 August from the Red Fort
 is kaaran baluchistan, gilgit kii janata un par hone vaale atyaacharon ke khilaaf sadakon par utari he
 They want freedom from the atrocities of Pakistan
 modi ne baluchistan ke logon kaa abhinandan kiya, yahi vajah he ki ab unhen karrwai kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 In the editorial article, "what action was taken on waving the flag of PAK?", The party has also targeted the bjp-ruled Center and the jammu-kashmir government
 shivasena ne poocha he ki pioke kaa mudda uthaaya gaya, jabaki kashmir main bhi roj pakistan kaa jhanda lahraane vaale or pakistan kaa gungan karne vaale kam nahin he
 Was any action taken against them in India? Freedom fighters are Baloch leaders: Shiv Sena has written that people killed and committed in Kashmir will be freedom fighters in Pakistan's eyes
 is lihaaj se hindustan main aane ke liye sangharsh karne vaale balooch netaa bhi swatantraaa senaanee hi hai, aisa ham maanate hai
 The party has questioned what the PM has to say on this

 Although these political parties are not contesting on their election symbols, but the head of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS)
 chandrashekhar raav vidhansabha chunaavon kii apni haalia kamyaabi ke baad in gramin chunaavon ko apni party ke daayre ko vistrut karne ke maukey ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 The direct strategy of the Chief Minister is that the popular support that his party enjoys can be redeemed to the maximum so that he can have a strong hold on local bodies and can play an important role in the expenditure of the Rural Development Fund

 The important thing is that these elections will also test the popularity of KCR after the decision to reduce reservation
 vipakshi dalon kii maang thi ki panchayat chunaavon ke elaan se pehle pichde virgon kii gananaa kaa kaam puraa kar liya jaae, lekin kesiar ne 31 janvari se pehle chunaav kara liye jane ke hycourt ke aadesh kaa paalan karne kaa faisla liya
 kcr's cabinet, which has only one deputy chief minister besides him, reduced the reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes by bringing an ordinance on 16 December
 iskaa sabase zyada prabhaav pichde virgon par padaa tha jinka hissaa 34 fisadi se ghatakar 23 fisadi rah gaya jabaki aabaadi main unka hissaa 54 fisadi he

 aam aadmi party loksabhaa chunaav se pehle apane har morche ko majboot karne main lagi he
 In the Delhi Assembly elections, the auto drivers played a key role in getting Kejriwal to the Assembly
 jiske chalate loksabhaa chunaav se pehle aap party ko ek baar phir se auto vaale or i-rickshaw waalon ko yaad aane lagi he
 The memory of the posters of Kejriwal vs Sheela behind the auto during the 2015 assembly elections may be blurring with people's minds right now
 teen saal pehle aap party ke vidhansabha main pahunchane ke baad auto waalon ko bhuulane lagi thi
 But before the Lok Sabha elections due next year, AAP once again remembered the auto owners
 aakhir poster to inke peeche hi lagane hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why by calling the auto people in the party office, a new wing is being tried to connect them with the party
 har raajnneetik dalon ne haq dilaane kaa vaada kiyisase pehle jab dilli main congress kii sarkaar thi us samay dilli waalon ko bas stesan or metro stesan tak pahunchane ke makasad se shila sarkaar ne galiyon ko sadakon se jodne ke liye i-rickshaw kii shuruyaat kii thi
 The introduction of e-rickshaws also brought many legal hurdles
 court kii dakhsandaji ke baad hi i-rickshaw kii bydaree charge ho saki
 Every political parties promised to give rights to e-rickshaws, but the AAP party has also made them into the color of politics by creating a new wing
 i-rickshaw ke sahare chunaav kaa safar tay karne kii firaqaap aadmi party bhale hi auto or i-rickshaw ke sahare chunaav kaa safar tay karne kii firaaq main ho par auto wing or i-rickshaw wing waalon ke party se matbhed abhi se dikhne lage hai
 It should not happen that the auto people turn somewhere else before reaching the floor and the party stays on the middle road
 aap aadmi party auto or i-rickshaw ke sahare chunaav kaa safar tay karne kii firaaq main he
 He is in the process of crossing the Styx of the Lok Sabha elections with them
 iske liye 'aap' ne auto or i-rickshaw waalon kaa ek nayaa wing bana diya he

 Iran's Elite Revolutionary Guard has blamed Saudi Arabia and the US for the terrorist attack on Parliament and Khomeini's tomb on Wednesday
 usne kaha he ki saudi ne tehran sthit sansad or khumaini makbare par hamale ke liye khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan iesas kaa samarthan kiya
 In addition to these terror attacks on Wednesday, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister Abdel Zubeir openly threatened that Iran would certainly have to bear the brunt of interfering in the Gulf and supporting terrorist organizations
 # UPDATED # saudifm: # Iranmust be punished for its interference in regionhttps: / / t
 co / sifv9sipbr — Al Arabiya English (@alarabiya_eng) June 7, 2017 While the Revolutionary Guard of Iran has pledged to avenge the double terrorist attack in Tehran
 unhone ek bayaan main kaha ki revolutionari guard aatanki hamale main jaan ganvaane vaale bekasooron ke ek kataraa khun ko bhi vyarth nahin jane degaa
 The terrorist attack comes a week after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and the leader of a reactionary government in the region (saudi Arabia), indicating that he was involved in the incident
 maaloom ho ki saudi arab or iran lambey samay se ek-duusare ke virdohi rahe hai
 Recently, US President Trump attacked Saudi with Iran on his first foreign tour
 paris daure par juber ne kaha ki iran alqaida samet anya aatanki sanghathanon ke sargana ko sangrakshan de rahaa he
 The terrorist attacks in Iran took place just hours after this threat from Saudi Foreign Minister Zubeir
 iran shiya bahul muslim raashtra he, jabaki saudi sunni bahul muslim raashtra he
 There is a figure of thirty-six between these two countries
 haal hi main donon deshon ne ek-duusare se rajanyik sambandh tak khatm kar liye the
 Now a situation of confrontation has arisen between Saudi and Iran
 isse pehle saudi samet saat deshon ne katar se rajanyik rishte khatm kar liye the
 Iran supported Qatar on this
 isse saudi arab samet kai desh iran se bhi behad khafa ho gaye hai

 He said that the firing between the attackers and the security forces is going on, but now the situation is under control
 sansad kii ore jane vaale sabhi raste band kar die gaye hai
 At the same time, Iran's Home Minister Abdolrej Rahmani Fazli said that Tehran is going to hold an emergency meeting of the Provinces Security Council
 haalanki unhone is babat zyada jaankaree dene se inkaar kar diya he
 Today is the 16th anniversary of the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament
 endie ke shasankaal ke dauraan 2001 main sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr chal rahaa tha or 13 disambar ko lashkar-e-taiyaba or jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankiyon ne vahaan par hamalaa kar diya
 The attack killed 14 people and injured 18, including 5 terrorists
 bhartiya suraksha agenciyon kaa daawa he ki is puure ghatnakram ko pakistan main baithe 3 khoonkhaar aatanki moulana masood ajahar, gaji baba urf abu jehadi or tarik ahamed ne anjaam diya
 16 years ago, there was a government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the Center led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and now the BJP government led by Narendra Modi is ruling in the country
 lekin loktantr ke mandir kahe jane vaale sansad par aatanki hamale ke asal gunahagaaron ko abhi tak sajaa nahin mil saki he
 Although India made many efforts to catch these terrorists, but even today they are out of our grip
 jaanate hai, hamale ke samay pakistan main baithe 3 bade mastermind aatanki kahaan hai or kya kar rahe hai
 Maulana Masood Azhar: Maulana Masood Azhar's name comes out on top among the famous terrorists, jahar-e-mohammed Azhar, who was roaming in Srinagar in 1994, was arrested in February
 is aatanki ko chhudaane ke liye 1995 main uske saathiyon ne kuch videshi paryatakon ko agava kiya
 Although one of them managed to escape, the rest of the tourists were killed
 iske baad 1999 main qandahar vimaan apharan kar aantki use chhudaane main kaamyaab rahe
 He attacked the Indian Parliament only 2 years after his release from India under Vajpayee rule
 vah yaheen nahin tehra, mana jaataa he ki 2008 main mumbai main hue aatanki hamale main bhi uski ahm bhoomika rahi
 He is also believed to have a suspected role in the 2016 Pathankot terror attack
 bhartiya sena or suraksha agenciyon ne ajahar or uske bhai ko is vaardaat ke liye doshi mana
 After this, India told about his antics at the international level, then Interpol issued a red corner notice against him for the second time
 bharat kii koshish rahi he ki ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kiya jaae, jis par america sahmati jataata he
 But China always veto in this matter
 uske sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ko bharat samet america, australia or england jaise kai desh aatanki group ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 Whereas in Pakistan he has a hero status

 sabaki kahani main ek amitabh jarur hota he
 For example, in Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Jamal describes how he was locked up in Sundas when Amitabh's helicopter landed in his neighborhood
 yaa phir kisi ke paas amitabh kaa dialog hi hoga, koi aisi line jise takhllus yaa abhivadan kii tarah istemaal kiya ja sake
 For example, the "hain", or the dialogue of the wall (1975) of Kharkharate Gale with Agneepath (1990), "bring the man's sign first
" ” unke bal ab tak puri tarah nahin pake hai
 We all have Amitabh in one form or the other and in the roles he played, we all find ourselves somewhere: from an angry young man to a romantic youth, a bitter father and a TV host
 , Whose innate attraction overcomes any discomfort associated with their aura
 naujavaanon ke pahn main or rudhipoon ke khilaaf bolne vaale or kisi bhi ugte suraj ko salaam karne vaale is nae bharat main amitabh kaa jaadu ab tak kaayam he, na sirf unke bich jo amitabh ko dekhte bade hue hai balki unke bich bhi jinhone pehali baar diarect tu home boxes par unhen dekha he
 Social commentator Santosh Desai says, "amitabh does not seem to shrink at any time
 ve kisi ek daur ke nahin hai balki har baat main praasangik hai
 Even in Amitabh's life, however, there was a time in the early '90s when, like other aging actors, he was also trying to prolong his youth
 us vakt kii tufaan (1989) or ajooba (1991) jaisi unki filmein iskaa udhaaharan hai
 Amitabh's comeback can be attributed to Yash Chopra's Mohabbatein (2000) and Sameer Nair's TV show Kaun Banega Crorepati
 ham aaj unki jo image dekhte hai, use banaakar unhone badlaav kaa formula dhundh liya
 Amitabh's beard may be white but his hair is not fully ripe yet
 70 varsh kii umr main bhi ve ekaadh ghante gym main varjish karte hai or lekhan, blog or twit karte hue kaaphi vakt gujaarte hai
 His stature is not made by his rule over Bollywood for two decades, but he has worked hard to keep himself relevant

 "along with this, Sharad Yadav also claimed that he is not afraid of these things and if he had to choose between life saving and struggle, he would choose the path of struggle
 sharad yadavane ye bhi kaha ki sarkaar virodhiyon ko chun-chun kar nishaanaa bana rahi he

 unhone kaha, "arvind kejariwal ke raajnneeti se kisi ko aitraaj ho saktaa he lekin unke or unke saathiyon ke upar bhrashtachar kaa aarope gale ke neeche se nahin utarane vaala he

 karnataka vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ne sattarudh congress ko patkhni de di he
 The Congress has got this defeat in all the 6 political zones of Karnataka, out of which at least three have been called Congress strongholds
 rajya vidhansabha kii 222 siton par voton kii ginati puri hone ke baad bijepi sabase badi party ke taur par ubhari or 36
 Won 104 seats with 2% vote share
 vahiin 38 fisadi vot share ke saath rajya main sattarudh congress ko mahaj 78 siton par jeet mili
 The state's regional party JDS 18
 3 fisadi vot share ke saath 38 siton par jeet hasil hui
 If all the zones of Karnataka, Old Mysore, coastal-karnataka, bangalore-karnataka, mumbai-karnataka, Central Karnataka and hyderabad-karnataka are responsible for this victory of BJP, then for Congress, along with the poor performance in all these zones, Coastal Karnataka, central-karnataka, Hyderabad lost their strongholds in Karnataka and Old Mysore
 old mysore kshetraold mysore kshetra main congress kaa pradarshan behad kharaab rahaa
 However, the alliance with bjp's regional party JDS proved to be a trump card here
 in chunaavon main congress ko 17 siton par jeet mili to bijepi ko 9 siton par jeet darj hui
 The BJP-JDS mobilization against the Congress won a total of 28 seats in the region
 ise padhein: ulta padaa congress kaa daanv, tipu sultan ke ilaake main BJP par barase votevahin 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main is kshetra main congress ko 40 seat to 2008 ke chunaavon main use 41 siton par jeet mili thi
 In 2008, JDS won 18 seats in Old Mysore region and in 2013 it won 30 seats
 vahiin 2013 main bijepi ko is kshetra main mahaj 5 siton par jeet darj hui thi
 It is clear from these figures that the Congress had to lose this stronghold in the region due to the BJP-JDS alliance
 vahiin bijepi ne is kshetra main congress ke baraabar pakad banaai to sabase zyada siton par jeet darj kar jedies ne congress kii sarkaar banane kii kshamta ko sabase karaara jhatka diya
 coastal-karnataka region: Congress led the state government in 2013 because of Karnataka's good performance in the coastal region, but in these elections, the Congress had to face the BJP here
 in chunaavon main jahaan congress ko mahaj 3 seat jeetne ko mili vahiin kshetra kii 21 siton main bijepi ko 18 siton par jeet hasil hui
 At the same time, 3 seats have gone to the account of others
 thik isi tarah 2013 ke chunaavon main bijepi ko is kshetra main munh kii khaani padi thi or vah sirf ek seat jeetne main safal hui thi
 At the same time, in the 2008 elections BJP had won 13 seats in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts of the region
 gauratlab he ki 2013 se pehle is kshetra ko bijepi kaa sabase majboot kila samajha jaataa tha or ab 2018 main is pradarshan ke baad ek baar phir costal karnataka rajya kii satta ko bijepi ke haath supurd karne main sabase kargar bhoomika main rahaa
 bangalore-karnataka region: The direction of Karnataka politics is also determined by voting in Bengaluru
 rajdhani bengaluru or irdagird kii vidhansabha siton par aamtaur par vikaas ke naam par voting dekhne ko milti he
 In these elections, Congress won 15 seats in this region, while BJP candidates were dominating 11 seats
 yahaan 4 siten jedies ke khate main gai
 Read this: BJP emerged as the largest party in Karnataka, but no one got majority in assembly elections
 In 2008, the region had expected BJP but in 2013 elections the region relied on Congress for development
 2013 ke chunaavon main bijepi ko kangras se ek kam seat par jeet darj hui thi
 In the total 28 assembly seats in the region, BJP won 12 and Congress 13 seats in 201 elections
 vahiin 2008 ke chunaavon main is kshetra main bijepi ko kul 17 siton par jeet darj hui thi
 In the 2018 election results, once again BJP is getting more seats than Congress
 mumbai-karnataka kshetrakarnataka ke mumbai-karnataka kshetra main uttar karnataka ke saat jile shaamil hai
 In the results of the 2018 assembly elections, the Congress has won just 17 seats in the region and BJP 30 seats
 vahiin jedies ke khate main 2 or anya ke khate main 1 seat darj hui he
 This is an important area for forming a government in the state
 vidhansabha chunaav 2013 ke nateezon ke aadhaar par is kshetra ko congress kaa garh mana gaya kyonki in chunaavon main congress ne bijepi ko tagdi shikast dete hue apni ummid se bhi adhik 34 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 At the same time, BJP had to be satisfied with only 14 seats
 vahiin 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ko is kshetra main 38 siton par apratyaashit jeet dekhne ko mili thi
 The Congress lost its stronghold of Central Karnataka in the Central Karnataka Legislative Assembly Elections 2018
 is kshetra main karnataka ke tumkur, daavangere, chitradurg or shimoga jile kii vidhansabha siten shaamil hai
 In these elections, the Congress won 11 seats in the region and the BJP won 24 seats
 vahiin jedies ko bhi is kshetra main ek bhi seat par jeet nahin mili
 In the 2013 assembly elections, Congress won 18 seats
 vahiin jedies ne in chunaavon main kul 10 siton par jeet darj karte hue bijepi ko mahaj 2 seat par simit kar diya tha
 hyderabad-karnataka region Hyderabad region is the area of the state adjoining Andhra Pradesh
 is kshetra main kul 31 vidhansabha siten shaamil hai
 In these elections, the Congress has found some success in saving its credibility on this area
 congress ke 15 ummidavaar is kshetra se vijayi rahe jabaki bijepi ko yahaan 13 siton par jeet darj hui he
 JDS has won 3 seats here
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main congress ko is kshetra main 19 siton par jeet darj hui thi vahiin bijepi ko mahaj 4 siten mili thi
 So FIR can be filed against that builder
 jaahir he graahakon kii drushti se ye bahut hi dilasa dene vaala he
 Prashant Balakrishnan, a persecutor of one such well-known builder in Mumbai, says that this is expected to curb the arbitrary attitude of the builders
 lekin builder ise vyavsaay ke liye ghaatak maan rahe hai
 According to Dharmesh Jain, president of Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry CREDAI, a project requires 50 to 60 permits from all government departments, which is common to take 2 to 3 years
 uske baad bhi agar bich main koi niyam badalata he to phir se sari kavayad kerani padati he
 Then to blame the builder alone means ending the construction industry
 bilders association of india ke sadsy anand gupta ke mutabik mumbai taqariban 50 hajaar buildingon main log bina okupashan praaanpatr ke rahete hai
 It is meaningless to just blame the builder for this
 agar koi jimmedaar he to biemasi se lekar duusare sarkari vibhaag or netaa hai jo building banane main 50 tarah ke rode atakaate hai lekin jhopra banane kii khuli chhot de rakhi he
 Now the police has given a new weapon to harass the builders
 tippaniyan With a view to regularizing the building business and securing the interest of the customers, the central government has enacted a regulatory bill along with legislation and has asked all the state governments to make their own draft bills within 6 months
 bilderon kaa kahana he ki bina regulatory body banaaye achaanak se is tarah kaa circular nikaalnaa naa sirf bhawan nirmaan vyavsaay ke liye nuksaandeh he balki graahakon ke liye bhi ghate kaa sauda he
 Today, there is a need for a transparent policy to fix responsibility for builders as well as government departments so that the building construction business can be promoted and everyone can get the house cheaply
 lekin maharashtra main to ulta hi ho rahaa he
 But the builders consider it fatal for the business
 maharashtra chembar of houseing industry cridai ke adhyaksh dharmesh jain ke mutabik ek project ke liye tamaam sarkari vibhaagon se 50 se 60 parmishan leni padati he jisame 2 se 3 saal laganaa aam baat he
 Even after that, if a rule changes in the middle, then all the exercise has to be done again
 phir akele builder ko jimmedaar tehraane kaa matlab construction industry ko khatm karnaa he
 According to Anand Gupta, a member of the Builders Association of India, around 50,000 buildings live in Mumbai without occupation certificate
 iske liye sirf builder ko jimmedaar tehraana bemaani he
 If someone is responsible, there are other government departments and leaders ranging from BMC to 50 types of obstructions in the construction of buildings, but have given an open hand to build a slum
 ab police ke haath main bilderon ko pareshaan karne kaa nayaa hathiyaar de diya gaya he
 The comments building vyavsaay ko regularise karne or graahakon ke hit ko surakshit karne ke uddeshy se centre sarkaar kanoon banane ke saath ek regulatory bill bhi bana chuki he or sabhi rajya sarkaron ko bhi 6 maheene ke bheetar apane-apane draft bill banane ko kaha he
 The builders say that suddenly removing this type of circular without creating a regulatory body is not only harmful for the building business but also a loss for customers
 aaj jarurat he bilderon ke saath hi sarkari vibhaagon ko bhi jimmedaari tay karne vaali paardarshee niti kii taaki bhawan nirmaan vyavsaay ko badhaava mili or sabhi ko saste main ghar mil sake
 But in Maharashtra it is going upside down
 bilders association of india ke sadsy anand gupta ke mutabik mumbai taqariban 50 hajaar buildingon main log bina okupashan praaanpatr ke rahete hai
 It is meaningless to just blame the builder for this
 agar koi jimmedaar he to biemasi se lekar duusare sarkari vibhaag or netaa hai jo building banane main 50 tarah ke rode atakaate hai lekin jhopra banane kii khuli chhot de rakhi he

 Mahabali of the arena, Bollywood's first hymn and the most perfect Bajrang Bali Dara Singh of the silver screen are no longer among us
 dil kaa daura padane ke baad mumbai main unka nidhan ho gaya
 He was 84 years old
 pichley 60 saal main daara singh ne hindustan ke dil par raaj kiya
 Today's generation may not even know that Dara Singh, who landed in the arena from the arena to the actress, is considered to be the first Heeman of Bollywood
 wo tarajan series kii filmon ke hero rahe hai
 The biggest support in the career of film actress Mumtaz also proved to be with Dara Singh
 bollywood main body dikhaakar staradam paane kaa rasta naa khulata, agar daara singh naa hote
 Yes, in Bollywood today, the trend of opening the shirt on every superstar and showing the muscle was started through Dara Singh
 jis vakt puri duniya main daara singh kii pahalwani kaa sikaa chal rahaa tha, tab 6 feet 2 inch lambey is gabaru jatt par bollywood is kadar fida hua ki pahalwaan daara singh ban gaye actor daara singh
 Even today, Bollywood knows Dara Singh as a star whose actresses like Mumtaz rose to prominence only after coming to fame
 daara singh kii pehali film 'sangdil' 1952 main release hui, jisamen dilip kumaar or madhubala lead role main the
 In 1955, he came out as a wrestler in the film Pehli Jhalak in which Kishore Kumar and Vyjayanth Mala played the main characters
 kushti or filmon main ek saath maujuudagi darz karaate rahe daara singh kii bataur hero pehali film thi 'jagga daaku
 After which he became the first action hero of Bollywood
 mumtaj ke saath daara singh kii jodi bani 1963 main film 'faaulad' se
 The magic of the pair of Shokh-bubbly Mumtaz and Heiman Dara Singh dominated the silver screen for nearly five years
 daara singh or mumtaj ne 'vir bhimsen', 'harculis', 'aandhi or tufaan', 'raaka', 'rustam-e-hind', 'samson', 'sikandar-e-aazam', 'tarazan kams tu dely', 'tarazan and kingkong', 'boxr', 'javaan mard' or 'daaku mangal singh' samet kareeb dedh darjan filmon main saath kaam kiya
 Till age, Dara Singh remained the most liked artist of filmmakers in Bollywood making action and religious films and after becoming old he became the father of superstar
 kushti ke baad daara singh ko sabase zyaada pyaar filmon se hi rahaa
 He built Dara Studio near Mohali and many other films as well
 daara singh ne hindi or punjabi main 8 filmein produs kin, 8 filmon kaa nirdesan kiya or 7 filmon kii kahani bhi khud hi likhi
 Dara Singh's last memorable film which has acted in more than 100 films was Jab We Met, in which he played Kareena Kapoor's grandfather
 wo aakhri dam tak filmon main judaa rahanaa chaahate the, lekin badhati umr or bigadati sehat saath nahin de rahi thi, lihaaza daara singh ne 2011 main lite-camera or ection ko alavida kah diya
 Dara Singh is an example of how one character changes one's entire identity
 serial ramayana main hanuman ke kirdaar ne unhen ghar-ghar main aisi pahchaan di ki ab kisi ko yaad bhi nahin ki daara singh apane jamaane ke world champion pahalwaan the
 This is the character who changed the entire identity of wrestler-turned-actor Dara Singh
 1986 main ramanand sagar ke serial ramayana main daara singh hanuman ke role main aise rach-bas gaye ki iske baad kabhi kisi ne kisi duusare kalakaar ko hanuman banane ke bare main sochaa hi nahin
 In the second mythological serial Mahabharata that came after the Ramayana serial, Dara Singh also appeared as Hanuman
 1989 main jab 'lav kush' kii puranic katha chote parade par utaari gai, to usamen bhi hanuman kaa role daara singh ne hi kiya
 Hanuman also became Dara Singh in the 1997 film Love Kush
 dilachasp baat ye he ki bollywood ko apane hanuman un daara singh main dikhe, jinaki filmi pari pahalwaan or daaku jaisi bhoomikaaon se shuru hui thi
 Later he also became the king and the prince of romance
 or jab 1960 or 70 ke dashak main puranic filmon kaa daur lautaa, to daara singh kii kadalathi dekhte hue unhen kabhi bhim banaaya gaya, kabhi balram to kabhi mahadev shiv
 In 1964, Dara Singh played the role of Bhima in the film 'veer Bhimsen'
 agle saal ai film 'mahabharat' main bhi daara singh hi bhim bane
 In 1968, in the film 'balaram Shri Krishna', Dara Singh appeared as Balaram, Krishna's elder brother
 1971 main film 'tulsi vivaah' main daara singh pehali baar bhagwaan shiv ke role main saamne aae
 He also played the role of Lord Shiva in 'hari Darshan' and 'har-har Mahadev'
 daara singh ko pehali baar hanuman banaaya nirmaataa-nirdeshak chandrakant ne
 Dara Singh played Hanuman in the film 'bajrang Bali' released in 1976
 is film main tab tak chocolati hero vishwajit ram ke role main the, jabaki lakshmana kii bhoomika shashi kapur ne nibhaai or ravan bane the premnath
 Twelve years after the release of 'bajrang Bali', when the Ramayana serial started, there was no dilemma about the role of Hanuman in Ramanand Sagar's Jehan
 wo puri tarah is baat se sahamat the ki hanuman kii bhoomika ke liye daara singh se behatar koi ho hi nahin saktaa
 Dara Singh can also be ill, it is a wonder for those who have heard stories of Dara Singh's strength
 punjab ke amritsar ke chote se gaanv dharmuchak ke gathile badan vaale is pahalwaan ne kushti main neshnal champion banane se pehle hi duniya main apane naam kaa danka baja diya tha
 There was no such wrestler from King Kong to the world, whom Dara Singh has not dusted in the arena
 kushti ke akhaade main isse bada naam shaayad duniya main koi doosraa nahin
 In front of this Rustam of Hind, every big wrestler of the world took his face
 tarif jitani bhi kii jaae, kam hi he or hakeekat bhi yahi
 rustam-e-hind, the world champion of wrestling of his time, Dara Singh, born on 19 November 1928 in Dharmuchak village in Amritsar, Punjab, was fond of becoming a wrestler since childhood

 bharat ne keval ek baar aisa kiya jab usne 2010 main chennai main brazil ko haraaya
 Somdev then won the fourth and Rohan Bopanna won the fifth match

 However, another aspect of this picture is that more than 50 percent of the donations received had to be thrown away
 is aashay kii khabar angreji akhbaar da times of india ne prakashit kii he
 The reasons responsible for the eye deterioration also include the negligence of the donor's family, who do not timely inform the nearby Eye Bank about the donor's death

 Ashwin Aggarwal said that at the time of mourning, the family of the donor forgets about informing the bank
 unhone kaha ki agar parijan suchit bhi karte hai, to maut ke 6 ghante ke bheetar aankh ko sangrakshit rakhane main samay antaraal bahut kam mil paata he
 Significantly, the donor's eyes should be implanted or preserved in the Eye Bank within the next 24 hours
 ai bank main ankhon ko 14 din ke liye sangrakshit kiya ja saktaa he
 In the midst of all this, many eyes received by donations go bad due to infection
 dow
 Aggarwal said, 'we do blood tests on diseases and if an infection is found in the test, the eye is declared unusable for the transplant
 unhone kaha ki jin logon ko maansik bimaariyaan yaa surgery hui hoti hai, unki ankhen transplant ke liye zyada upyogi nahin hoti

 While trying to make the railways not a pawn of coalition and power politics, the opposition BJP wanted to know from the government that when the railway was earning so much profit during the tenure of former railway ministers Lalu Prasad and Mamata Banerjee, how did its economic condition suddenly deteriorate? It was said that there was an opportunity to increase the passenger fare
 rajyasabha main rail bajet par charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue bhaajapa netaa balbir punj ne kaha ki yah kisi sarkaar he jisamen pradhanmantri pehle rail mantri ke bajet kii tarif karte hai or kiraaya badhaane ke kadam ko jaij tehraate hai
 Later, the Prime Minister leaves Dinesh Trivedi out of the Cabinet
 punj ne kaha ki rail bajet trivedi kaa koi nijee bajet nahin tha
 Its proposals would have received consent from both the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister
 unhone kaha ki yadi bajet main koi gadabadi he to usase pradhanmantri or vitt mantri kaise bari ho sakate hai
 He said that instead of Trivedi, a person has been made Railway Minister, who had refused to accept the instructions given by the Prime Minister to take stock of the railway accident in Assam
 punj ne kaha ki trivedi ke istife main kai rahasy chhipe hue hai
 Did the Trinamool Congress not know that railway passenger fares were going to increase? unhone kaha ki yah ek behad jatil maamla he or trivedi ko swayan aa kar is maamle main apana paksh sadan main rakhana chahie
 Punj said, “the remote button was pressed while sitting in Kolkata and there was an earthquake in Delhi
 ’pradhanmantri par gathbandhan kii raajnneeti ke aage sir jhukaa dene kaa aarope lagaate hue unhone kaha, ‘remote se sarkaar chal sakati he, desh nahin
 The BJP leader questioned the government whether passengers would be provided the proportion in which the fare was increased in the railway budget
 unhone kaha ki yatriyon ko na to pehle suvidha mili thi or na hi aage zyada suvidhaayen milane kii ummid he
 He said that the freight was put on the entire country by increasing the freight a week before the railway budget
 unhone sarkaar se sawaal kiya ki purv rail mantri lalu prasad yadav or mamata banerjee jab baar-baar yah kehete rahe ki railway kii sthiti acchhee he or railway munaafe main he to aaj yah sthiti kaise ban gai ki rail yatri kiraaya badhaane kii naubat aa gai
 He said that it should be appreciated that at least Trivedi has presented the real picture of the Railways in the Railway Budget speech

 lekin mangalvaar ko vidhansabha main jab ajam khan se amar singh ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone apane man kii baat bayaan karne ke liye ek mjedaar kahani sunai
 In fact, a day before in Amar Singh in Delhi, in a special interview given till date, he was fiercely angry and even said that he is thinking of resigning as a Rajya Sabha MP
 amar sinhane kaha ki mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav galat logon se ghire hue hai or haalat yah he ki unhen mulaakaat kaa samay bhi nahin diya ja rahaa he
 On Tuesday, when Amaz Khanse was asked about Amar Singh's statement, Amar Singh told the story of a dog
 kahani ye he ki ek parivaar ke paas khaane ko kuch bhi nahin tha or ghar main sab bhukhe the
 When the mother could not think of anything, she caught the dog going in front of her and cut it and cooked it to eat
 jab pita ghar lautaa to usne apane bachche se poocha ki aaj ghar main khaane main kya bana he
 The poor child was wondering what to say
 usne sochaa ki agar sach bolta hum to maa ko maar khaani padegi or agar jhooth bolta hum to pita ko kutta khaanaa padegaa
 Azam Khan said that on Amar Singh's question, my position in the party is like that of a child
 darasal dobaaraa samaajawaadee party main aane ke baad amar singh ko vah mahatv nahin mil rahaa he jisaki unhen ummid thi
 That is why they are very angry

 Last Thursday, Trump wrote a letter to Kim Jong Un, citing Pyongyang's hostility towards the cancellation of the conference
 haalanki iske ek din baad hi trump ne kaha tha ki sammelan purv yojana ke anusaar hi ho saktaa he
 Earlier, South Korean President Moon Jae-in had said on Sunday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is committed to a surprise meeting with US President Donald Trump and to free the Korean Peninsula completely from nuclear weapons
 moon ne kaha tha ki vah or uttar korea ke netaa is baat par sahamat hue hai ki agar 'jarurat padi' to vah vyaktigat rup se milenge, yaa baat karenge
 Let us know that earlier Trump had shocked the world by announcing the cancellation of his meeting with Kim
 lekin is baatcheet main nayaa mode tab aayaa jab somvaar ko trump ne twit kar kaha he ki 'hamaara america dalkim jong unaur mere bich hone vaali vaarta kaa prabandh karne ke liye north korea pahunch gaya he'
 For now, the whole world is eyeing whether this meeting can be held in Singapore on June 12

 Angered by her husband's absence, the sub-inspector wife, along with her brother and uncle, went to husband Hitendra's school
 pati ke skool main hi esai patni aapa kho baithi
 There was a ruckus between the first husband and wife and after that Naubat reached the beating
 skool ke staff ke saamne hi patni belt lekar pati par tut padi

 Now there is no place where its roots have not reached
 yahi vajah thi ki varg, jati or majahab ke daayaron se upar uthakar logon ne anna kii ore rukh kiya
 This movement also bridged the party divide as Anna remained far away from the old trick of describing one party as better than the other
 unke anshan sthal par vipaksh kii rangath sirf isliye zyada rahi kyonki koi sattadhari party apane hi khilaaf virodh pradarshan nahin kar sakati

 This is the contradiction, which is expected to blow up LK Advani's proposed Rath Yatra against corruption
 yah aisi yatra hogi, jiskaa koi saaf mukaam nahin he
 Personally, Advani can legitimately claim that he resigned from Parliament after the Narasimha Rao government accused him of taking bribe from a businessman during elections and only after he was acquitted from court Came back par 2011 kii yah yatra ve apni nijee pratishtha ko or pukhta karne ke liye nahin kar rahe hai
 He is also a leader of the BJP
 ve itane bhi anaadi nahin ho sakate jo yah kahen ki bhaajapa ne daagi rakam ko kabhi haath nahin lagaaya
 If they did, obviously no one would believe them

 But it is such an advantage
 jaise hi usne khud ko eemaandaaree kaa avatar bataane kii koshish kii, vah mushkil main funs jaaegi
 The parties involved in the Janata Party had similarly taken advantage of Jayaprakash Narayan's movement of 1974 and 1975 in 1977

 No one is going to show that kind of favor to the opposition parties in 2011
 udhar uttar pradesh main to jaise yatraaon kii mahamari kaa khatra aa khadaa hua he, jahaan siyasat ek tour guide ban jane ke kagaar par ja pahunchi he

 Is it not possible that after convincing the end of the game with the Congress, the BJP leaders are busy dealing with each other? It is too early to say right now
 yah shoshebaaji, dhol-dhamaaka tab tak chalata rahegaa, jab tak ki chunaav ayukta naam kii vah sthulkaay mahadevi apana bhompu na baja de
 There is always time to make mistakes in politics

 After this he escaped
 greval ke jane ke baad mahila ne britain se baahar apane dost ko phone par aapbeetee sunai jisane police se sampark kiya
 After this, the police arrested him
 maamle kii jaanch karne vaale adhikari ne mark palmer ne kaha, "mujhe yah bhi ummid he ki yah yon utpeedan ke shikaar logon ko aage aane ke liye protsaahit karegaa
 It will also convince them that the authorities take such crimes seriously
 " The last date for filing income tax returns for the financial year 2018-19 is 31 July
 naukareepesha logon ko unke daftar se form 16 milane bhi shuru ho gaye hai
 In such a situation, it is important to know that while filling the income tax returns of this year, what will be the items which have been brought by the department from this year
 masalan, form ke praaroop main badlaav, koun si jaankariyaan zyada deni hongi aadi
 Chartered accountant Ankit Gupta says, "this year there have been many new changes that are important to know not only for individual taxpayers but for all types of taxpayers
" in badlaavon ke peeche sarkaar kaa uddeshy karadaataaon kii aay or kar se judi zyada se zyada jaankariyaan jutanaa hai, jisase kar chori par lagaam lagaai ja sake
 "these new changes happened this year
 When a taxpayer sits down to file his income tax return this year, he must first link his PAN number to Aadhaar
" beete varsh tak keval form main isaki jaankaree deni jaruri hoti thi
 But from this year, there is an imperative to link PAN and Aadhaar
 aise karadaata jinaki salanaa aay paanch lakh rupye tak he or koi inakam tex rifund clem bhi nahin he, ve ab ofline ritern file nahin kar sakate
 It is mandatory for them to file online returns which were not there till last year
 pichley saal tak karadaata paper ke jariye bhi apana ritern file kar sakate the
 a new column has been added to the income tax return form with the name of the pensioner
 aise karadaata jinako pension ke rup main aay praapt hoti he unhen aay ke strot main spasht karnaa hoga
 It will also be necessary to disclose income from other sources from this year
 ab tak anya strot se praapt aay kii rakam likhi jaati thi
 But from this year it has to be told what is the source of income? Two new sections 80 TTB and 80 GGA have been included in the income tax form this year
 80titibi senior citigen ko epady par milane vaale byaaj par kar laabh se sambandhit he
 At the same time, 80 GGA is related to the interest received on the amount given for donation
 is saal se property bechney par hone vaale capital gen ke sambandh main zyada jaankaree deni hogi
 For example, buyer's name, PAN number, full address of property, amount of sales, buyer's stake in property, etc
 aise karadaata jisaki krishi se aay paanch lakh se zyada he unase pehali baar detail maangi gai hai
 In the information sought, various information will have to be given, including the address of the cultivated land, the measurement of the land, the ownership of the land or on the share
 agar kisi karadaata ne vitt varsh ke dauraan daan ke rup main raashi di he to use bataanaa hoga ki kitni raashi nakad main or kini anya madhyam se di gai he
 This is because more than two thousand donations cannot be given in cash and the tax benefit limit is also 2000 rupees
 agar koi karadaata inakam tex rifund kii raashi jald paanaa chahta he to use aise khate ko ritern bharte samay darj karnaa hoga jo pehle se vaid ho yani iskar vibhaag kii kitabon main darj ho or vibhaag ke saath us khate main len-dein kiya ja chukaa ho
 If TDC is deducted on any income during the financial year, at the time of the claim, it has to be told under which item the income is shown
 yah vahi aay honi chahie jis par kataa tex karadaata clem kar rahaa he
 Individual taxpayers who are directors in a company cannot fill ITR 1 or 4
 unke liye itiaar 2 bharna jaruri hoga
 Apart from this, taxpayers filling ITR 4 will be required to register all GST numbers at the time of filing income tax along with turnover
 to is saal iskar ritern file karte samay rakhen is baton kaa khyaal
 You will also face penalty for not filing income tax returns on time
 aise main samay rahete apana ritern bharna na bhoolen

 Be it masala films or movies like October and Badlapur, they have beat every genre
 varun ab jald hi sharat kataaria kii film "sui dhaagaa" se vaapasi karne vaale hai
 This is the most different film for Varun ever
 isse pehle unhone is tarah kii film nahin kii he
 This film of Varun not only does emotional but also gives quite a strong message
 'mek in india' campan se prerit hokar banaai ja rahi yah film khud apana kaam shuru karne ko prerit karti he
 While many actors like to be associated with their own genre, Varun prefers to experiment with his characters
 ab tak ke unke trek record ko check karen to samaj aata he ki unhone har kism kii filmein kii hai
 Speaking to DNA, Varun wrote, "I am the person who did Badlapur in 2015
 lahar ke vipareet tairnaa mere diene main he
 i can't stick with chocolate boyimage

 Coming to India can now be more expensive for tourists

 It is simply a matter that the buyer will have to bear
 air condishan vaale restaurant or baar ko bhi 28% kii dar se tex dena hoga
 Tourism ranks third in providing employment opportunities in the country
 prayek sailaani jo desh main aa kar hotel main rukta he
 After that 28 people get employment opportunities
 aise main tex kaa bhaar is udyog par baari pad saktaa he
 The comments gaanv main heritage hotel chalane vaale sanchaalak chintit he khaskar isliye kyonki GST ke daren ek samaan he
 From Rs 5000 per room to five star hotel or villa properties, everyone has to pay tax in a normal way which is unfair
 heritage hotel association ke general secretary ranbir singh madhava kaa maananaa he ki bharat kaa bijnes duusare deshon main shift ho saktaa he
 He said - Tourism in India will be less and the employment of the people will be affected

 He argues that in a country like France, 80 million tourists come but there is only 5 tax in the tourism sector
 5% he
 Khalid Khan, president of Rajasthan Association of Tour Operators, says - coming to India has never been cheaper and we have sold hotel rooms to foreign agents for this year
 ab nayi tex daaron ke mutabik khamiyaja yaa to tour oparator kaa hotel maalik ko bhugatna padegaa

 Restaurants and bars with air condition will also have to pay tax at the rate of 28%
 paryaton desh main rojgaar ke avasar uplabdh karwaane main tisare sthaan par he
 Every tourist who arrives in the country stops at the hotel
 uske peeche 28 logon ko rojgaar ke avasar milte hai
 In such a situation, the tax burden on this industry may be heavy
 tippaniyan The operator running the heritage hotel in the village is worried especially because the GST rates are the same
 5000 rupee prati kamare se lekar paanch sitara hotel yaa phir vila properties, sabko ek saamaanya tareeke se tex dena hoga jo anfere he
 General Secretary of Heritage Hotel Association, Ranbir Singh Madhwa believes that India's business can shift to other countries
 unhone kaha- hindustan main tourism kam hoga or logon ke rojgaar par asar padegaa
 Tourism, hotels and tour operators are now urging the government to reduce this tax
 unki daleel he ki france jaise desh main 80 million paryatak aate hai lekin vahaan paryaton ke kshetra main tex sirf 5
 Is 5%
 rajasthan association of tour operators ke adhyaksh khalid khan kaa kahana he- india aana kabhi bhi sasta nahin rahaa he or hamane videshi agents ko is saal ke liye hotel kamare bech die hai
 Now according to the new tax charges, the hotel owner of either the tour operator will have to suffer

 "that means Sarita
 sarita kii kahani surkhiyon main kabhi nahin aati, agar usne 9 june, 2008 ko haryana ke dijipi offis main aatmahatya na kii hoti
 Sarita was forced to commit suicide because the policemen raped her and the entire police department and the elder officers refused to take action against the culprits

 After the sentencing, both have told the media that high officials were also complicit in the matter, they are being implicated to protect them
 doshi pulisavaale ab hycourt main apil karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 However, Sarita's husband Subhash is also not satisfied with this decision and plans to appeal in the High Court
 haalanki india today se baatcheet main rohtak range ke iji anil kumaar raav kehete hai, “is maamle kii jaanch sibiai ne kii he
 We cannot interfere in the court case, but we are happy that the culprits were punished

 We have no role in this
 ” ve bataate hai ki is maamle main balaatkaar or aatmahatya ke do cese darj hai, jinamein se ek par faisla aayaa he
 The Haryana Police may be trying to call it a case of the Central Investigation Agency, but a bitter truth is that due to the threats being received in Rohtak, Subhash was forced to shift to Jhajjar from 7-8 months ago
 subhash kehete hai, “pulisavaale or unke rishtedaar aksar rohtak main unke ghar pahunchakar dabaav banaate or paison kaa laalach dete
 20-20 lakhs sometimes
 kaa laalach diya karte or dhamkee dete ki paise le lo betiyon kii jindagi sudhar jaaegi varanaa tumhen bhi kuch ho gaya to inkaa kya hoga
 Fearing these threats, Subhash once refused to even identify Balraj and Silak
 lekin phir baad main court main unhone puri baat bataai
 When the Special CBI Court of Ambala was delivering the verdict, Subhash was in his native village Baghpur in Beri tehsil of Jhajjar district, about 225 km from there

 The next day Sarita was summoned to the Central Investigation Agency office to sign some papers and Rs 6,000
 rishwat maangi gai, lekin usne manaa kar diya
 After this Balraj Singh and Silak Ram raped her in the police station
 25 april ko subhash ke reeha hone ke baad sarita ne use isaki jaankaree di
 After this, both of them gave a written complaint to the Rohtak SP, which was sent to the DSP

 She became nervous for her husband and children
 aakhirkaar sarita ne suicide note likhakar jehar kha liya or edijipi daftar main jaan de di
 Subhash explains, “for the sake of justice we wandered from Rohtak to Panchkula for two months

 Subhash shows the old newspaper clippings and Sarita's applications from a file, "she was very understanding

 ) England fast bowler James Anderson has made a big attack on Indian captain Virat Kohli
 anderson ne kaha, 'kohli ko lagata he ki jab tak bharat jeet rahaa he, tab tak agar vah ran nahin banaate to yah myne nahin rakhata' to wo jhooth bol rahe hai
 According to James Anderson, if the Indian captain says that the individual form will not matter in the five-test series starting on August 1, then he is lying
 darasal, kohli ko england main saal 2014 main ran banane ke liye jujhna padaa tha or vah paanch test main 134 ran hi bana paae the jo test cricket main unke sabase kharaab pradarshan main se ek he
 Kohli, however, managed to score 655 runs in five Tests during India's 4–0 win against England during the 2016–17 home series against England
 maujuuda daure kii shuruyaat main kohli ne apane form ko lekar kiye sawaal ko hansi main taalte hue kaha tha ki vah yahaan khilne kaa lutf uthaanaa chaahate hai or jab tak team acha kar rahi he, tab tak vah apni vyaktigat form ko lekar chintit nahin hai
 Anderson said, "of course it matters to win here in India, Virat will be desperate to score runs for his team, as you would expect from a captain and one of the best players in the world
" 'is 35 varshiya tej gendbaaj kaa kohli ke khilaaf record shandaar he, unhone 2014 ke daure main 6 pariyon main chaar baar kohli ko out kiya tha
 Overall, in Test matches, Anderson has dismissed Kohli five times
 anderson ko haalanki 2016 ke bharat daure ke dauraan jujhna padaa tha or vah teen test main chaar wicket hi hasil kar paae the
 Anderson said, "today cricketers learn not only by watching match footage, but also from past experience, so i expect Kohli's level batsman to have learned from the previous series (in 2014) here
 'unhone kaha, 'mujhe yakeen he ki vah apane khel ke vishisht pahaluon par kadi mehnat kar rahaa hoga or isse uske tathaa sirf mere hi nahin balki uske or hamaare baaki gendbaajon ke bich sangharsh kaaphi romaanchak hoga
 'it is very hot in England at present and the conditions may be more favorable for India in the upcoming series

 bharat ne tii 20 antarrashtriya maichon kii siries 2-1 se jiti, jabaki england ne ekadivasiy antarrashtriya siries isi antar se apane naam kii
 Kohli hit two half-centuries during the ODI series (75 in Nottingham and 71 in Leeds), indicating that he is in good form
 anderson se jab is bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'iskaa jawaab dena kaaphi mushkil he kyonki aapako lagata he ki laal gend adhik swing karti he or adhik seem hoti he lekin aisa nahin he
 He said, 'A batsman like Virat plays the ball so late that he has a lot of time and feels that you are a slow bowler, sometimes in white ball cricket when the batsman is more aggressive than the red ball cricket
 If you try to be, then you can create more opportunities
 kul milakar kuch kahana mushkil he
 After the retirement of AB de Villiers, Steve Smith's one-year ban and the New Zealand winters, Kane Williamson's break this summer will be exciting in place of runs between two in-form batsmen Kohli and England's Joe Root
 in sabhi ko gendbaaji kar chuke anderson se jab philhal duniya ke sarvshereshth ballebaaj ko chunane ke liye kaha gaya to unhone kaha, 'eemaandaaree se kahuun to mujhe inamen se kisi ko bhi gendbaaji karnaa pasand nahin he
 He said, "it is difficult to choose one of these because they are all different in their own way, they have a lot of characteristics, the thing that puts them above other batsmen in the world is to harmonize in different formats of the game
