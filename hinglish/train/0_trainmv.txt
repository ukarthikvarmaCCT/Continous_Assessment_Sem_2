 Significant changes have been made in the entrance exam of IIT, the country's premier institute of technology
 ab 2017 se hone vaali pravesh pariksha main chaatr kii ranking tay karne main uske 12veen kii pariksha main laaye gayi numberon kii 40 pratishat kii arhata ko samaapt kar diya jaayegaa
 But this year in 2016, this examination will be done under the rules of the previous year
 upie sarkaar ke vakt ye niyam bane the kii kisi bhi chaatr ke 12veen ke numberon kii 40 pratishat vettege hogi
 That is, in deciding its ranking, 40 percent roll will be of 12th numbers
 ab ise samaapt kar diya gaya he lekin chaatr ko 12veen main 75 pratishat number laane honge
 It will be mandatory for SC / ST category students to bring 65 percent number
 tippaniyan Kapil Sibbl, who was the Education Minister during UPA-2, brought these changes by saying that he wants to end the dependency of the students on the coaching institutes
 haalanki rajyon ke kai board is system kaa virodh bhi karte rahe, kyonki rajyon main chaatro ke liye sibiesai board kii tarah number laana mumkin nahin ho paata
 In this context, now the condition of bringing 75 percent number in the new rules and 65 percent for scheduled caste students can also be opposed

 However, many boards of states also opposed this system, because it is not possible for students in the states to bring the number like CBSE board

 maharashtra main muslim aarakshan khatm ho rahaa he
 The bjp-shiv Sena government of the state has 'deleted' the matter of upholding Muslim reservation from the reservation bill laid in the assembly on Tuesday
 jabaki keval maratha aarakshan ko kaayam karne kii baat par jor diya he
 This has raised the question of the future of Muslims in the state
 maratha va muslim aarakshan kanoon ko court se sampoorn manjuuri na milane ke chalate sarkaar par 24 disambar se pehle faisla lene kaa dabaav bana tha
 The government ordinance implementing the reservation expired on December 24
 kanuunan adhyadesh ko chah maheene ke bheetar vidhanmandal kii manyata jaruri hoti he
 Earlier the congress-ncp government had implemented 16 per cent reservation for Maratha society and five per cent for Muslims through special ordinance
 yah aarakshan shiksha ke saath sarkari naukariyon main bhi lagu hona tha
 The then congress-ncp government, while implementing the reservation, claimed that this reservation was being given to end the backwardness of Marathas and Muslims
 patrkaar kethan tirodakar ke saath anya logon ne is nae aarakshan kaa virodh kiya or bombai hoicourt main ise radd karne ke liye yachika pesh kii
 Those opposing Maratha and Muslim reservations claimed that with this new 21% reservation, the total reservation in Maharashtra is going up to 74%
 jo ki gaiyr-sanvaidhanik he
 In Maharashtra, 52 per cent reservation is already in operation
 isi ke saath aarakshan ko hataane kii maang karte hue yah bhi kaha gaya ki, maratha varg pichhadaa nahin he
 Maratha is the ruling Jamaat of Maharashtra
 jo chaaturvarnya main kshatriyon kii sharenee main gini jaati he
 The Bombay High Court, rejecting the Maratha and Muslim Reservation Act, accepted these claims and approved the continuation of only five per cent reservation in education for Muslims in Maharashtra
 supreme court ne bhi is faisle ko kaayam rakhaa
 In such a situation, after increasing political pressure, the Fadnavis government had to try to implement the reservation again through the bill as per legal advice
 lekin, is vidheyak ke masaude se muslim aarakshan kii baat hataa di gai he
 As soon as this decision was announced, the atmosphere of the winter session of Nagpur in Maharashtra Legislature is hot
 ensipi vidhayak ajit pavaar ne is par aapatti uthaate hue kaha he ki, "bhaajapa kii sarkaar sangh ke ajenda par kaam kar rahi he
 This decision will create a rift in the society
 " Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis did not say anything openly on this decision but, on the go, he said that "muslim reservation of previous government will be released till current financial year i
e
 31st of 2015"
 " At present, it will be a challenge for the BJP government to approve the Reservation Bill Act in the Legislative Council on the last day of the session

 Tamil superstar Rajinikanth on Tuesday called Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Narendra Modi) a "charismatic" leader like Jawaharlal Nehru and Rajiv Gandhi, crediting the bjp's landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections (loksabha Elections 2019)
 Given to leadership
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki congress (congress) adhyaksh rahul gandhi (rahul Gandhi) ko party kii karaari haar ke baad istipha dene kii jarurat nahin he
 He said that he is young and probably did not get the support of senior party leaders
 rajnikant (rajinikanth) ne kaha ki vah guruuvar ko pradhanmantri ke shapath grahan samaaroh main bhaag lenge or unhen is samaaroh main shaamil hone kaa nyauta mil gaya he
 "the victory in the Lok Sabha elections is the victory of single leadership and that is Modi," he told reporters here
 yah jeet ek karishmai netaa kii jeet he
 "this senior cine artist has placed Modi (PM Modi) in the ranks of India's tall leaders Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, k Kamaraj, CN Annadurai, MG Ramachandran, m Karunanidhi and j Jayalalithaa" "after him (the country) got Modi, a charismatic leader," he said
 agar aap tamilnadu main dekhen to yahaan kamraj, anna, kalainar, mjiaar, jayalalita jaise netaa hue hai
 On the same lines, this victory has been achieved by Modi's leadership
 ''unhone (rajinikanth) kaha ki dakshini rajyon tamilnadu or kerala main ‘modi virdohi' lahar ke kaaran bhaajapa (BJP) ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa jabaki desh ke baaki ilaakon main modi ke samarthan kii hawa bah rahi thi
 He said, "when there is a political wave, no one can swim against it and it will flow
" '' superstar ne kaha ki tamilnadu main tutikorin ke sterlite maamle, kaveri muhane main methane gas nikasi pariyojna or vipakshi dalon ke ‘‘bade str ke prachaar'' ke kaaran bhaajapa ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 He (rajinikanth) replied to the question of Rahul Gandhi's resignation, "he should not resign
 ' unhone kaha, ‘‘main yah nahin kahata ki unamem netritv ke gun nahin hai
 i think it is a really difficult task to manage a Congress party where there are a lot of senior people
 ''tamil superstar ne kaha ki gandhi ko tyaagptr dene kii aavashyaktaa nahin he kyonki loktantr main vipakshi dal bhi mahatvapurn hota he
 In response to a question, he (rajinikanth) said that the Center should solve the water crisis of Tamil Nadu immediately
 unhone centre ke is ruukh kii prashansa kii ki vah godavari or krishna nadiyon ko jodne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 (from input language) bijepi ke louhpurush kahe jane vaale varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani apane kareebi saathi or purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke ghar main hi begaane ho gaye hai
 His own people have done this
 adwani kaa shahar main aagaman ho rahaa he, lekin puure shahar main lagi hordingon, bannron va postaron se adwani gaayab
 On Friday, Advani's former President A
K
 pi
 J
 abdul kalam ke saath shahmina road par bane scientific kanvension centre ke udghaatan kaarykram main shaamil hona tha
 He also joined the program
 lekin kaarykram ko lekar puure shahar main jo hording, binar va poster lagaae gaye the, usamen adwani kaa kahin ata-pataa nahin
 According to BJP sources, at the behest of Lucknow MP Lalji Tandon, people associated with the party had put up big banners, posters everywhere
 lekin poster or hordings main atal kii tasviir to thi, lekin 'louhpurush' kii tasviir gaayab
 a party official said, 'only those who want Modi can do this
 varanaa atal ke saath adwani kii tasviir na ho, yah to bade hi dukh kii baat he
 All this has been done in a planned manner on behalf of the Modi camp
 'lakhanu main kanvension centre, pradesh karyaalay, kaisarbagh, nur manzil or nishatganj sthit gomti pul ke paas lagi badi-badi hordingon se adwani nadaarad rahe
 When asked the reason for the organizers, no one is ready to open their mouth
 is baat kii bhi charchaa rahi ki is kaarykram main party adhyaksh rajnath singh ko shaamil hone kaa nyotaa jaan-boojhkar nahin bheja gaya
 Apart from Rajnath, no invitation was also sent to Narendra Modi, while Modi's close friend Amit Shah was to come to Lucknow on Friday
 lekin kuch kaarnon se der raat unka daura tal gaya
 Regarding the program, local MP Lalji Tandon has only said that the program should not be viewed through political glasses
 bijepi pravaktaa chandramohan singh se is babat poocha gaya, to unhone is masale par koi pratikriya dene se inkaar kar diya
 Significantly, in 2012, a meeting of the National Executive was held in Lucknow
 tab bhi bannron va postaron se adwani ko gaayab kar diya gaya tha
 But when the matter caught fire, overnight banners and hoardings were changed at the behest of a big leader
 9321933400 or 7804907062, yahi wo do mobile number hai jinamein tamaam raaj kaid hai
 These are the two numbers with the help of which the Jodhpur Police wants to tighten the screws around the law around Asaram so that it becomes difficult for Asaram to come out of jail
 darasal iff do numberon main se pehla number yani 9321933400 asaram kaa he
 Asaram used to talk to specific people just at this number
 par wo phone khud nahin uthaate the, naa hi phone ko choote the
 His cook picked up the phone and put the same phone in Asaram's ear
 doosraa number yani 7804907062 shilpi kaa he
 The same artisan who is accused of preparing girls studying in Asaram's Gurukul and sending them to Asaram's confinement
 asaram or unki gurukul kii warden shilpi khud ko chaahe lakh paak-saafe bataae par kol detail donon ke daavon kii chugali karte hai
 The craftsman who was refusing to even know Baba till March this year, the same craftsman not only starts talking to Baba suddenly after a month i
e
 from April, but as the time passes, the conversation between Shilpi and Baba gets longer
 And it is a coincidence to see that this process of conversation started with one or two calls gradually increases and all this goes on till the student studying in the Gurukul of Chhindwara The girl is not taken to Asaram's stigma
 asaram or unki chalaabaz chaukadi ke paas is telefonic baatcheet ke haq main chaahe koi bhi daleel ho, lekin police kii tafteesh jo kahani bayaan karti he wo behad chaunkaane vaali he or usase bahi zyada chaunkaane vaali cheez hai phone kol kii ditels or taarikh
 This call detail and date hide the full truth of the conspiracy of sexual abuse
 , ajtak
 On March 15, Shilpi was sent as a warden of Chhindwara Gurukul from Haridwar at the behest of Asaram
 chhindwara pahunchate hi shilpi ne nayaa phone number liya or wo number he 7804907062
 After reaching Chhindwara, there is no talk between Shilpi and Asaram on phone from 15 March to 23 April
 shilpi asaram ko pehali baar 23 april ko phone karti he
 After this, for the second time she calls Asaram on 27 April
 phone asaram ke mobile number 9321933400 par kisia gaya tha
 This number is registered in the name of a Mandeep Chhabra
 april main do baar baatcheet hone ke baad shilpi teesri or chauthi baar 10 or 11 june ko asaram ko phone karti he
 Then comes a long gap
 june ke baad shilpi 22 or 31 july ko phir asaram ko phone karti he
 There are long talks both times
 is tarah 23 april se lekar 31 july tak yani kareeb sava teen maheene main asaram or shilpi kul mila kar sirf chah baar phone par baat karte hai
 After this, on August 6, the victim's girl has a stomach ache
 idhar dard uthaa udhar agle hi din yani saat agast ko shilpi phir asaram ko phone karti he
 The next day i
e
 on August 8, he talks to Asaram on the phone, but as the time comes for the girl to be taken to Asaram, the conversation between Shilpi and Asaram increases
 9 agast ko jab ladki chhindwara gurukul se jodhpur asaram ke paas jane ke liye ravaanaa hoti he, tab bhi shilpi asaram ko telephone karti he
 After this, the two also hold talks on 10 August
 13 agast ko jab peedit ladki asaram se milane jodhpur pahunchati he, tab bhi shilpi or asaram ke bich mobile par baatcheet hoti he or ye sab kuch 17 agast tak chalata he
 According to the complaint of the victim girl, Asaram had tortured her on 15 August
 haalanki ahmedabad ashram ke media prabharee udai sangani kaa kahana he ki shilpi or asaram ke bich ye baatcheet gurukul main khaane-pine ke intazaam ko lekar hui hogi lekin ye puche jane par ki pehle donon ke bich aisi baatcheet kyon nahin hui, sangani ke paas iskaa koi pukhta jawaab nahin tha
 Now the question is why from August 6 to August 17, there was so much conversation between Shilpi and Asaram and why suddenly the conversation between the two stopped after August 17? The Jodhpur police is searching for the answer to this question
 asaram or shilpi ke kol ditels kii ek or chaunkaane vaali sachai he or wo he batcheet kaa vakt
 From July 23 to July 31, out of the six calls that Shilpi had made to Asaram, the longest conversation was held on July 31
 shilpi ne asaram se ek minute 18 second tak baat kii thi jabaki baaki pach baar mushkil se donon main paanch se pandrah second tak hi baatcheet hui
 But on 6 August, the victim girl falls ill and the next day, on 7 August, Shilpi talks to Asaram for a total of six minutes and five seconds
 ab tak kii sabase zyada lambii baatcheet
 On the morning of August 7, Chhindwara Gurukul director Sharat Chandra calls Asaram from his mobile number 9354719340 and talks for 6 minutes 32 seconds
 sharat chandra ne isse pehle pichley chah maheene main kabhi asaram ko phone nahin kiya tha
 After this, on August 8, Shilpi talks to Asaram for 4 minutes 34 seconds
 usee roj asaram ko shiva bhi apane mobile se phone karata he or 2
 Talks 34 seconds
 nau agast ko peedit ladki gurukul se apane ghar ke liye ravaanaa hoti he or das agast ko shilpi baapu se saat minute phone par baat karti he
 Then on August 13, when the girl reaches Baba, Shilpi 5
 30 minute tak phone par baba se baat karti he
 Shilpi's last conversation with Asaram takes place on August 17 and the last time the two ever talk is eight minutes
 kamaal ye he ki asaram ke desh bhar main kareeb saadhe chaar sau ashram or gurukul hai par shilpi ko chhod kar asaram se sidhe phone par baat karne kii himmat or ijaajat kisi or warden ko nahin thi
 The most important thing is that from August 7 to August 17, the location of Asaram's phone was continuously in Rajasthan

 The Bar Council on Monday announced an intervening issue of four Supreme Court judges objecting to the functioning of the Chief Justice of India (CJI), but some questions are still alive
 inamen se ek he jajon kii varishthata kaa
 It is mentioned in the letter of four judges that the Chief Justice "first Amang Equals, Nothing More Nothing" means that the CJI is equal to the rest of the Supreme Court judges, not more or less
 ye bhi ek parampara yaa dharna par aadhaarit vyavastha he
 Many things are going on in the Supreme Court and traditions are unwritten
 varishthata kaa maamla bhi isi main aata he
 Current Chief Justice Justice Deepak Mishra and second-most senior judge Justice J
 chelmeshwar kii niyukti ek hi din 10 aktubar 2011 ko hui
 The question is what does the system say on the issue of seniority
 do jaj agar ek hi din niyukt honge to koun senior mana jayega
 On this, the system says that if two judges are appointed in the Supreme Court on the same day, then the tenure of their High Court in terms of seniority will also be taken into consideration
 justise chelmeshwar isi maamle main justise deepak mishra se pichhadate hai
 His retirement is also being held before Justice Mishra (2 October 2018) ie on 22 June this year
 mukademon kii bench tay karne ke alaava jahaan tak faislon kaa sawaal he to kisi jaj kaa faisla kisi se bada nahin hota
 The decision of the bench of two judges can only reverse the bench of judges with a higher number
 nyaay ke maamle main chif justise or baaki jaj ek baraabar hote hai
 The triple talaq case is a fine example of this when the then Chief Justice J
J
 es
 Khehar and Justice Abdul Nazir were not of the view to make triple talaq illegal
 lekin baaki teen jajon ne ise gaiyr kanoonee mana or 3 : 2 ke bahumat se faisla sunaaya gaya
 Obviously, in the matter of administrative powers, the Chief Justice is paramount and the situation has become clear from the decision taken in the past in the matter of deciding the bench of the Master
 jajon kii likhi chitthee main virodhabhas ye he ki ek taraf ve kehete hai ki nyaay ke maamle main chif justise baaki jajon ke baraabar hai or duusari taraf ve apni varishthata kaa hawala dekar mahatvapurn maamalon ke alotment par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 When all the judges are equal then it is reasonable to see senior-junior in the case allocation
 bataa den ki film main maadhuri dikshit, anil kapur, reetesh deshmukh, arshad varsi, boman irani or javed jaafaree bhi hai

 Owaisi said that the court should pronounce a verdict on the Ayodhya dispute at the earliest
 kisi se baat nahin karegaa muslim personal lau boryodhya maamle par supreme court kii tippanee par hyderabad se saansaisduddin ovaisika kahana he ki yah koi order nahin he balki ek objaraveshan he
 The quarrel is with the title, who has the title, it will be decided in their right
 isse pehle bhi kai baar baatcheet ho chuki he, jiskaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has decided that now they will not talk to anyone
 personal board ne kaha he ki is masale kii roj sunwaayee ho or jald se jald faisla kiya jaae
 courtowasi should decide on Ayodhya dispute soon, says that while the Supreme Court can sit on the issue of triple talaq during the holidays, Ayodhya issue should also be heard continuously
 supreme court kah rahaa he ki yah gambhir maamla he
 When three are listening to the issue of divorce, then listen to this issue with them
 jaldi faisla kar lijie kyonki chah baar is mudde par pehle bhi baatcheet ho chuki he
 On BJP Yogi becoming the Chief Minister, Owaisi said that we have opposition from both BJP and Yogi
 donon kii vichaardhaara hindu raashtra banane kii he
 We are opposed to the BJP and will continue to be so
 duusari baat yah he ki agar uttar pradesh ke boojadkhaane band ho jaaenge, to pradesh ko 11 hajaar 680 karod kaa nuksaan hoga
 On the talk of 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' CM Adityanath's 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', Owaisi said that we know that it is just a slogan, there is no reality in it
 agar sabake vikaas kii baat hoti, to kisi musalmaan ko bhi tikat diya gaya hota
 This clearly shows that with the creation of a Hindu nation, all efforts are being made to weaken India

 rajasav mantri or barmer se jaaton ke ek pramukh netaa hemaram choudhary ne 24 july ko istipha de diya tha
 After this, he also returned his car and bodyguards and opted out of government work
 istife se pehle ve leelana main congress samarthak kisaanon ke saath baatcheet kar rahe the, jahaan se prastaavit rifinary ko pachapadara sthanantarit kar diya gaya he
 The refinery is being set up with the resources of the state
 ghoshnaa ke pehle hi din se ise lekar koi na koi vivaad khadaa ho rahaa
 The BJP questioned Gehlot for not getting the grant from the Center for the refinery and publicized that it would lead to lack of resources in the state
 yah bhi ki chaar saal main chaalu hone ke vaade ke ulat isamen das saal lagenge
 The government's contract with the refinery-setting company Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd
 was refused to provide information under RTI
 sarkaar ko dar tha ki isse uske kuprabandhan kaa rajfash ho jayega
 The farmers demanded more compensation after Gehlot announced compensation to unrealistic levels for oil and gas projects in Barmer
 iske baad paas kii hi jagah pachapadara main jameen ke saude kiye jane shuru hue, jahaan benami saudon ke tahat netaaon ko jameendaaron ne coditon ke daam jameen bech di
 The Gehlot government was also accused of land scam on the announcement of taking the refinery to Pachpadra
 is maamle par bhadke bujurg congressi vidhayak karnal sonaaram ne gahalot par aarope lagaaya tha ki ve apane bete vaibhav gahalot ko pachapadara se chunaav main utaarne kii jameen taiyaar kar rahe hai
 The allegation was also made in front of Gurdas Kamat, national general secretary of the Congress and in-charge of Rajasthan
 gahalot ne isse inkaar kiya
 Sonaram also accused Hemaram of not protecting the interests of the farmers
 is ilaake ke jameen vaale zyaadaatar garib hai
 He has suffered the most damage in both Leelana and Pachpadra

 The government continued to deny this until 18 hours after his resignation
 25 july ko gahalot bole, ''hemaram bahut bhavuk hai
 This issue is very local
 '' gahalot ne sanket die ki hemaram ko istipha waapas lene ke liye manaa liya jayega
 But this whole incident revealed the truth of the refinery issue
 gahalot chaar saal tak ise dabe baithe rahe or chunavi varsh main yaad aa gai
 a few days ago, on July 22, Gehlot's trusted Public Works Minister Bharat Singh said in a Congress meeting in front of Kamat that he would not contest the next election

 ek transgender kaa ek nami magazine ke cover par aana apane aap main ek bahut badi kamyaabi he or ye koi iklauta udhaaharan nahin he
 In the city of Kochi itself, a transgender is a cashier in a prestigious restaurant
 24 saal kii dipti nair kaa kerala kii nami magazine vanita par aana na keval unke liye badi uplabdhi he, balki ye samaaj ke liye bhi bahut khaas he
 Deepti was Shinoz till two years ago but today she is a successful model
 kuch hi kilometre kii duuri par rahane vaali 29 saal kii tripti kochi ke ek femes restraan Pappadavada main kaisier hai
 Satpati is a transgender and stands on her feet
 tripti kahati hai ki duniya main koun aisa hoga jo bheekh mangakar jeena chahega
 Transgenders never progressed because people never accepted them at social level
 unhen kaam karne kaa mauka hi nahin diya
 She says that when she started a job here, she had not told anyone other than the restaurant owner that she was transgender
 wo bataati hai ki unke man main logon kii soch ko lekar ek bada dar tha
 a month later, Satisfy told the truth to everyone, but the good thing is that no one treated Abhuti badly
 restraan ke sabhi log unhen chhechi kehete hai, jiskaa matlab he badi bahan
 Three years ago, Triti Shetty was Kiran Shetty

 bharat ne 8 november 2016 ko aadhi raat se desh main 500 or 1000 rupee kii karency ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kiya gaya to iskaa asar dakshin asia kii sabhi arthvyavasthaaon par padaa
 Particular impact was felt on the two neighboring countries Bhutan and Nepal as India is the largest trading partner of these two countries
 iske chalate in donon deshon main bhartiya karency kii chamak thik usee tarah he jaise bharat samet puri duniya main dollar chamakta he
 This is the reason why the rupee was as dirty (black) in India as it was in both these countries
 kitna bigadaa bhutan kaa hepiness index?bhutan kii baat karen to isaki arthvyavastha kuch is tarah gadhi gai he ki yah desh hameshaa bharat se emport karata rahegaa
 The trade balance of this country will always be negative
 bhutan kaa kendriya bank bhartiya rupee ko legal tender maanata he, yani gharelu karency ke baraabar bhartiya rupee ko bhi darja mila hua he
 With this, Bhutan will always depend on the Indian rupee for its economic development
 iskaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki bhartiya videsh mantralay ke vaarshik bajet kaa sabase bada hissaa (lagbhag ek-tihaai, 5 hajaar karod rupee se adhik) bhutan par kharch hota he
 That is why, on the night of 8 November, when 500 and 1000 rupee notes were declared to be canceled, on the morning of 9 November there was a long queue like a bank in New Delhi in front of the banks of the border city of Funtsholing in Bhutan
 9 november kii subah bhutan kii rajshahi paidaa hui sthiti se nipatane ke liye lagaataar videsh mantralay se sampark saadhane main juty thi
 But amid the demonetisation started under the command of the PMO in the country, the Ministry of External Affairs itself had no suggestion to fight the situation
 bhutan kaa royal kendriya bank lagaataar rigerv bank or state bank of india ke sampark main bhi rahaa ki use note badalane ke liye kya karnaa or kya nahin karnaa chahie

 Cash economybhutan's daily English newspaper Qinsel continued to report that the people of Bhutan are queuing up to change the Indian currency that was declared illegal
 akhbaar main yah bhi kayaas chhapata rahaa ki seemapar se bhartiya kaarobaari bhutan ke nagarikon ko kamishan ke laalach par bainkon ke baahar qatari main lagava rahe hai
 At the same time, there was also the possibility that due to the economic relations with India, a large amount of black money in the country is present in the Indian currency, which is considered more secure, which is coming out
 nepal main notebandi se dhwast hua pakistani racketbhutan kii tarah nepal doosraa desh he jahaan rupaya ek legal tender ke taur par kaam karata he
 Customers in Nepal's banks can deposit Indian rupees in their accounts without any discrimination
 antarrashtriya mudra bazaar main nepal kii karency bhartiya rupee ke saath bandhi hui he(pegs karency) jiske chalate dollar ke mukaable jab rupee main giravat darj hoti he to utani hi giravat nepal kii karency main jodi jaati he
 Although distinct from Bhutan, Nepal is a country which does large business with India as well as China
 lekin badi sankhya main nepal ke naagarik (5 million se adhik) bharat main kaam karte hai or apni kamai ko nepal main rakhte hai
 The Indian government invests heavily in Nepal's economy
 nepal ke kendriya bank main badi maatra main bhartiya karency maujuud rahati he
 Taking advantage of these two things, black money exists in Nepal as well as Indian citizens
 bharat or nepal ke bich karency sambandh kaa sabase bada phayda pakistan kii khufia agency iesai uthaati he
 According to official statements, Pakistan has been putting fake currency in the Indian economy by the same means to deploy terrorism in India
 lihaaja achaanak aae notebandi ke faisle ne nepal main bhi afra-tafari kaa maahaul paidaa kar diya tha
 The foreign ministry, including the central banks of the two countries, remained in constant contact to deal with this problem
 haalanki notebandi ke ek saal baad bhi bhartiya rigerv bank or vitt mantralay kii taraf se aisa koi aankada jari nahin kiya gaya he jisase pataa chal sake ki in deshon main kitna rupaya ekatra hua
 But during the last one year, the Indians doing business in these countries, including the citizens of Bhutan and Nepal, have made it clear that the ban on Indian currency will not go away so soon

 DNA quoting Bookmyshow's live events head Kunal Khambati - The response to Ed Sheeran's concert is truly shocking

 Why did Bieber come suddenly from Mumbai after the show, Bieber also came in the recent time Bharatmai Mangestin Bieberka also took place at the DY Patil Stadium in Mumbai where all the big stars of Bollywood arrived
 khabar thi ki bollywood unke liye party bhi host karne vaala tha lekin vah sho ke baad chupake se chartd plane se waapas laut gaye the

 sicurity se lekar khaane tak
 
 
 He was given a grand welcome
 baharhaal ab bibar to aakar ja chuke hai or nazren ab sheeran ke concert par tiki hai
 Let's see what demands he keeps before coming to India and what Salman Khan's Shera seems to be in his security, like Bieber was taking care of! chhattisgarh main fasal beemaa yojana kisaanon ke gale kii fans ban gai he
 Thousands of farmers had reached Chief Minister Raman Singh's hometown Rajnandgaon to narrate their complaint to him, but he could not meet Raman Singh
 darasal mukhyamantri dilli main bijepi sansadeey board kii baithak main shaamil hone ke liye do din tak rajya se baahar hai
 Therefore, the Agriculture Minister of the state took the front
 darasal peedit kisaan yah maang kar rahe hai ki fasal beemaa yojana ko beemaa companiyon ke phaayde ke liye nahin balki kisaanon ke hit main lagu kiya jaae
 With this demand, these farmers arrived here from remote areas
 wo mukhyamantri raman singh ko bataanaa chaahate hai ki fasal beemaa yojana se aakhir kinakaa bhala ho rahaa he?kisaanon ke mutabik unhen ye bataaya gaya tha ki fasal beemaa yojana lagu hone ke baad unka bhala hoga, basharte wo apni fasal kaa sahi vakt par beemaa karvaa len
 Also, care should be taken that his premium is paid on time
 kisaanon ne in sabhi baton ko maanate hue apnifasal kaa beemakaravaaya or samay par uske premium kaa bhugtan bhi kiya lekin jab baari fasal nuksaan ke bime kii adaayagi kii ai to beemaa companiyon ne apane haath khadey kar diye
 The companies made it clear to the farmers that their crop loss cases do not meet the criteria of the crop insurance scheme
 kisaanon ke hangaame ke baad beemaa companiyaan bhugtan ke liye raji to huin lekin apni sharton par
 The insurance companies paid the crop loss amount to farmers at one, two, five and ten rupees per acre
 vahiin varsh 2017 ke nuksaan kaa ab tak bhugtan nahin ho paaya, lihaaja ye kisaan rajanandgaanv main pahunch kar mukhyamantri ko apane halaat se rubaru karana chaahate hai
 According to farmer Tikam Verma, who is spending thousands of rupees in premium, according to farmer Tikam Verma, hundreds of farmers in his village have received loss insurance ranging from Rs 2 to Rs 30, while farmers have paid thousands of rupees in insurance premium
 unhone bataaya ki beemaa companiyaan fasal bime se khub kama rahi hai lekin sarkaar kaa dhyaan us ore nahin he
 Farmer Chandu Sahu also told the same situation
 unhone bataaya ki isyojna kaa koi phaaydakisaanon ko nahin hua he
 He demanded that crop insurance should be done for the farmers individually and not as a unit of Grampanchayats
 unhone kaha ki isse kisaanon kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 On the other hand, Agriculture Minister of State Brijmohan Agrawal has argued that this scheme is proving beneficial for the farmers
 unke mutabik pichley varsh lagbhag 300 karod rupee bataur premium beemaa companiyon ke khate main gaya, jabaki kisaanon ke khate main 1200 karod se zyada kii rakam muaavje ke rup main beemaa companiyon ne jamaa karwaai
 Chhattisgarh had a severe drought in the year 2017
 sarkaar ne 21 jilon kii 96 tahseelon ko suukhaagrast ghoshit kiya tha
 During this time the crop of thousands of farmers was completely destroyed, only few farmers were able to extract the cost of their crops
 or zyaadaatar kisaanon ke haathon main kuch nahin aayaa
 In such a situation, the farmers hoped that they had spent thousands of rupees as crop insurance premiums to compensate them for the loss, but the insurance companies dismissed most of the cases of the farmers outright
 13 lakh main se 5 lakh kisaan hi the muaavje ke yogyakharif sijan 2017 main rajya ke lagbhag 13 lakh kisaanon ne fasal beemaa karavaaya tha, ye sabhi kisaan sahakaari bainkon ke karjadaar the
 The premiums were transferred to the insurance companies account only through banks
 sookhe ke baad jab beemaa companiyon ne kisaanon ke khet khaliyaanon kaa jayja liya to 13 lakh main se maatr 5 lakh kisaan hi muaavje ke yogya paae gaye
 Of these, 30 percent were farmers who received two, five and ten rupees as compensation
 chhattisgarh main 37 lakh se zyada registerd kisaan hai lekin bamushkil 12 se 13 lakh kisaan hi fasal beemaa karavaate hai
 In fact, it is necessary to take loans of these farmers for farming, hence crop insurance has become their compulsion
 bagaiyr fasal beemaa karawaaye bank kisaanon ko lone nahin dete
 On the other hand, after crop insurance, insurance companies turn their back on their behalf
 aise main kisaanon ko lag rahaa he ki fasal beemaa yojana unke phaayde ke liye nahin balki beemaa companiyon ke phaayde ke liye he

 What are they asking for? ham to sanvaidhanik body laaenge
 Will bring in time
 ham hairaan rah gaye
 There is no simple majority in the Rajya Sabha
 kaise laaenge
 Shocked
 uske baad aapane dekha kya hua
 The law was introduced on 17 December 2013
 let kar diya
 Our movement was for the Lokpal Bill
 loksabhaa main unke paas number the
 The BJP had numbers in the Rajya Sabha
 ham unke saath sampark main the
 Jaitley saheb, Swaraj sahab, Advani ji
 sab sahamat ho rahe the
 They were welcoming our suggestions
 congress netaa satyavrath chaturvedi ne ahm role nibhaayaa
 But the point is that Rahul Gandhi missed a golden opportunity
 surajevaala:ham sab aadarneey kiran bedi kaa bataur noujvaan sammaan karte hai
 He has a new love for BJP
 magar main kahana chahta hum ki ramlila maidan main baithkar sansad par dabaav kii raajnneeti kab tak chalati rahegi
 Kiran Bedi: Anna sat on hunger strike after the Congress tussle
 tab tak chaar jagah congress chunaav haar chuki thi
 Anna also sat down
 dabl pressure ho gaya
 And how much loss
 udhar narayan swami sahab tivi par bolte najar aane lage
 That we are bringing the bill
 maine rajyasabha sachivalay main phone kiya
 Told that it has not even come on the agenda
 maine anna ko bataa diya ki jhooth bol rahe hai
 Then Anna said where are the agenda
 sarkaar phir jhooth bol rahi he
 The government sat on the bill from November 2012 to December 2013
 isiilie bill paas hone par anna ne sapa ko chhodkar sabko dhanyavad kiya sapa chhodkar
 Kumar Vishwas: If Kiran ji is saying that BJP was supporting Anna Hazare's movement
 to vah karodon logon kaa dil tod rahi hai
 If the BJP or the Sangh supported, it cannot be denied
 magar manch par unka koi vyakti nahin tha
 Digvijay Singh used to say repeatedly that the people of the Sangh are
 kiran ji samet sab netaa bole the ki aisa nahin he
 Question: When Anna agitated, there was a movement in 20 thousand places in the world
 magar jab bill paas hua, tab ek jagah khushi nahin hui
 Why? Kiran Bedi: This is the question i want to raise
 aam aadmi party ne bina bill padhe ise khaarij kar diya
 Said, even a rat cannot die
 aditya thakare:mudda hona tha ki kiskaa haath yuvaaon ke saath
 Those studying in college
 canteen bathroom kharaab hai
 Jobs are not coming
 padhai ke baad kya karnaa he, ye nahin pataa
 Whether anyone is thinking about those posted on the outskirts
 chunaav honge
 There will be charges
 magar jo jitkar aaenge
 They will work together
 sawaal: aapaki party 40 saal se puraani he
 The image of Shiv Sena is Goya is a party to hooliganism
 kya he aapaki party kaa agenda
 What has changed aditya:badlaav se zyada kaam bad rahaa he
 i myself am 23 years old
 ham yuva sena ke taur par jo kaam kar rahe hai
 Today i can rightfully say
 mumbai main 30-40 collejon main vahaan nae canteen or bathroom ham de sake
 The issue of Mumbai Press Club was talked about
 vahaan koi vandlism nahin hua
 Disrupted
 ham kaam lekar ja rahe hai
 New people are joining ham tamilnadu ke har jile main yuva sena bana rahe hai
 What is the need to wear a mask? ham maharashtra ke baahar ja rahe hai
 Question: Nowadays the face which Modi is presenting, is talking development oriented
 magar vah hindutv kii baat bhi karte hai
 Will the country be rebuilt or Hindu nation be built? Anurag Thakur
 desh ko vikaas or sushasan chahie, hamane rajyon main kiya, desh main karke dekhaayenge
 People who are repeatedly talking of communalism, communalism
 unki dikkat ye he ki apane das saal ke kaarykaal main bataane ko kuch nahin he
 Elections were held in four states
 70 fisadi siten jite
 No slogan of Hindutva was given
 hamane madhya pradesh ko bimaaru rajya se agada rajya bana diya
 Our agenda is good governance and development, not Hinduism
 jab ham aazaadee kii 75veen varshganth manaae hai
 So say PM from Red Fort
 desh main 100 fisadi sakshartaa he
 Aditya: Development is important for us as well
 magar hamen ye kehane main shame nahin ki ham hindu hai
 Our Hindutva is that when our soldier Hemraj was beheaded and the people of Ajmer Sharif's dargah said that we will not allow the people of Pakistan to enter
 to hamaari party ke saansadon ne jaakar unka sammaan kiya
 This is our Hindutva
 surajevaala:yuvaaon kaa skill development
 Will have to give a chance
 partiyon main matbhed ho sakate hai
 But the path is clear
 ham usee kii baat karte rahe hai
 Aditya Thackeray: Whoever became PM
 neshnal youth council bana de
 Youth in every field should be there
 piem se sidhaa interection ho

 ) It was only nine years ago that when a Ranchi player came to Team India in gray-black waving hair, fellow players felt strange
 kuch uskaa mazaaq bhi udaate the
 Cricketer Akash Chopra joined Team India in 2004 and was Dhoni's roommate
 akaash ne badi saralata se kubula, ''maine usase kaha tha, ye lambey bal kataa le
 Won't run here
 ajeeb-se lagate hai
 Then he said to me, what do you know about the whole country having these hairstyles tomorrow
 ”maahi kii yah baat sach hone main chand maheene hi lage
 Dhoni cut the same in every town saloon
 dhoni ke bal ab safedi se bhare hai, laharaati julfon kii jagah commando cat he—par ve ab bhi utane hi bade style iken hai
 His hair was previously curly, straightened and dyed by Dheeraj Kumar of Kaya Salon, Ranchi
 yaheen se dhoni ko lambey bal rakhane kii prerana mili
 However Mahi's friends say that they neither care nor know much about style and fashion
 captain banane ke baad press conference karne ke liye angrezi to chamakaani padi, lekin doston ke bich unka andaaj abhi-bhi desi he
 There is also the story behind Mahi's commando cut
 patni sakshi ko unki lambii julfen pasand nahin thim
 Second is his army love
 dhoni se jab poocha gaya ki cricket se sanyas ke baad kya ve baaki saathiyon kii hi tarah camentator banenge? unhone jhat kaha, ''bilkul nahin
 i will spend time with the army
 ” maahi sena ko lekar bahut pashnet hai
 The country wants to serve, that too by being stationed on the outskirts
 jab teritorial army main shaamil hue the to kaha tha, ''main rajput hum, sena mere khun main he
 "now Mahi wants to jump
 lekin iske liye training anivaary he
 At least 14 days are required simultaneously
 or yah unke shedul main manage kar paanaa naammumkin he
 He is very tight about this
 isiilie cricket ko alavida kehete hi pehla kaam yahi karnaa chaahate hai
 Last year, he took time to go to the loc in Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu, rajouri, uri, srinagar or leh se lekar siyaachan base camp tak gaye
 Stayed in the bunker with the soldiers
 phir arunachal bhi gaye
 Took arms training there, interacted with fellow soldiers
 cricket se vakt nikalataa he, to andorsement karne hi padate hai
 The time that is left from that, Dhoni tries to distribute it equally in the house and the army
 maahi kaa army, banduukon or bikes se lagaav kisi se chupa nahin he
 But wonder that Mahi's love has not changed for years even in the changing world
 jin shaharon main unka zyada vakt bitta he, vahaan ve apni motorcycle jarur rakhte hai
 Mahi's 4 bikes are parked in the hotel in Chennai
 roj in par sawari karte hai maahi
 They are relaxed in speed
 ve chalaate bhale tej hon par bahut surakshit rider hai
 Once during a fielding practice in South Africa, he was giving such details of his dream bike to Gautam Gambhir that Gautam said, "if you are so fast then buy a jet, not a bike
 ”aaj 30 bikon ke unke bede main 28 lakh ru
 Is also the strongest Hellcat bike
 kabhi koi deshi motorcycle bhi unke liye sapana thi
 Robin Kumar, who was a roommate with Dhoni in Kharagpur, says, "he rode a bicycle
" maine sabase pehle laal pulsar kharidi
 When we went out, he would insist on sitting behind me
 jo shaks 350sisi kii bullate se irshyaa karata tha, aaj vah eks12 helcat kaa maalik he
 Kumar also denied that Dhoni was fond of milk, saying that he had a cold addiction
 chocolate dhoni kaa pehla pyaar tha
 a friend says that it is not possible to separate Dhoni and chocolate
 doston ne lekin unhen kabhi sharaab pite hue nahin dekha
 Earlier girls also did not like them
 bhartiya cricket team main 9 saalon ke baad lagata he, maahi kii jindagi ab khuli kitaab he
 But this is your illusion
 ve duniya ko vahi or utana hi dikhaate-bataate hai jitna ve chaahate hai
 The real mahi is a very common man who finds his world in his family and friends
 dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ke liye raahat kii khabar he
 The Delhi Government and the Joint Committee of Delhi Police have recommended withdrawal of the cases registered during the dharna against all the leaders including Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia
 yani alag-alag partiyon ke netaaon ke khilaaf aise kareeb 35 maamle waapas liye jaaenge
 The case of the 49-day government will also be returned
 The 49-day Kejriwal government had challenged the central government to sit on the Rail Bhavan directly
 tab pehali baar siem bane kejariwal khud bhi dharne par baithe the
 The case was about sitting on a dharna where they were not allowed to perform
 isliye police ne maamla darj kiya tha
 Most of the cases of the case against India Against Corruption will be withdrawn, most of them were filed against Kejriwal and his associates when they performed under the flag of India Against Corruption
 in netaaon ko mili raahatgin netaaon ko raahat mili he unamem kejariwal or manish sisodiya ke alaava mantri kapil mishra, purv mantri raakhi birlan, vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa bijendra gupta, BJP saansad pravesh sahib singh verma or vijay goyal or congress netaa mukesh sharma kaa naam shaamil he
 Therefore, all the withdrawn casein have got relief because in one such case last year, BJP leader Dr
 harshavardhan ke khilaaf tab maamla waapas liya gaya jab dilli main raashtrapati shashan tha
 Based on this case, now Kejriwal and the rest of the leaders are relieved
 15 maamalon par vichaar hi nahin kiyaalag-alag partiyon ke netaaon ke khilaaf dilli main kareeb 50 cese darj hai, jinhen netaa rajnatik maamle bataate hai
 When the government and police committee sat together, it was not considered appropriate to consider 15 of these, because it was not possible to take them back
 baaki 35 maamle cameti ne waapas lene kaa faisla kiya
 65 Company Central Armed Police Forces (capfs) were also allotted to the state for election
 iske alaava police, piesi va homeguard ke javaanon kii alag se tainaati kii gai

 unhone kaha ki padosi deshon ke alpsankhyakon ko sankat kii sthiti se nikaalnaa or unke hiton kii raksha karnaa is bill kaa makasad he, afghanistan or bangladesh main alcenkhyak samudaay ke adhikaron kii raksha kii ja sakati he
 The government had already issued orders to protect the rights of the people of these communities
 vahiin shivasena ke saansad arvind saavant ne kaha ki hamaare hi khun ke logon kaa utpeedan ho rahaa he or ab kis had tak yah utpeedan ho rahaa he iskaa bhi pataa lagaana chahie
 He said that we should protect the people of these religions and if they are not able to do so then what is the benefit
 saavant ne kaha ki assam ke logon ko bhi aashwast karnaa hoga or unki chitaayen dur kerani padengi kyonki assam ke logon ko apane adhikaar chhinane kaa dar he
 BJD MP Bhartrihari Mahtab said that the JPC tried to reach a consensus on the bill
 unhone kaha ki pakistan se aae sharnaarthiyon ko naagarikta dene kii baat 2009 main bijepi ne apane ghoshnaptr main kii thi
 But then the UPA government came back to power
 mehataab ne kaha ki padosi deshon ke hindu or buddha alpsankhyakon ke paas koi vikalp nahin he jabaki isai samudaay ke logon ke liye vikalp he
 Bhartrihari Mahtab said that the Constitution does not discriminate on religious grounds in granting citizenship
 bill main sharnaarthi, pravasi shabd kaa kahin istemaal nahin kiya gaya, lekin sharnaarthi desh ke liye samasya hai kyonki vah hamaara haq maar rahe hai
 Saugata Roy said that the bill mentions Hindu, Parsi, Buddhist, Sikh, there is a need to make it secular
 hamaari maang thi ki bangladesh sharnaarthiyon ko is bill main shaamil na kiya jaae lekin cameti ne hamaari maang ko thukraa diya
 Why only Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are named in the bill
 isamen nepal or srilanka kaa bhi naam ho kyonki anya mulkon se aane vaale har dharm ke logon ko apane desh main panaah deni chahie
 What is the Citizenship Bill, the Citizenship Bill 2016 has been introduced in the Lok Sabha to amend the Citizenship Bill 1955

 krishak mukti sangram samiti enjio or ol assam students union bhi is bill ke virodh main saamne aae hai
 Opposition parties Congress and All India United Democratic Front have also opposed giving citizenship to a person on the basis of religion

 From social media, hologram avatars and selfie clicks, Modi has done everything in this election to woo voters
 soshal media ko hathiyaar banaakar chunaav ladane kaa idia bijepi ne baraak obama ke chunaav abhiyaan se uthaaya tha
 When Barack Obama made his name in the White House race by chanting 'yes we can' in the virtual world
 obama kii hi tarj par modi or bijepi ne apana master plan banaaya
 In the virtual world, Narendra Modi is active on Twitter and Facebook
 soshal media ke in donon plateformon ne chunaav main badi bhoomika adaa kii he
 The election campaign of BJP and Narendra Modi also remained social media focused

 Modi was tagged in 8 million tweets

 While 40 thousand people called him a favorite
 lekin sawaal ye he ki modi ke paas phone koun sa he jisase wo apni selfi lete hai
 This phone covered by the cover is the iphone 5S, so Modi is often seen in the news taking his selfie

 So far, the Congress of Himachal Pradesh, which has been in the paws of aged leaders, has now come to the hands of the new youth team
 pehle 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav or phir disambar, 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main congress kii haar ke baad sanghathan ko tarotaaja karne ke liye ‘formula bhaajapa’ talasha gaya
 After the manner in which the Congress veterans got knocked out in the assembly elections, the organization is handed over to the new younger generation
 haalanki nai peedi main bhi zyaadaatar puraane kaddavar netaaon kii santan hai
 State party president Sukhvender Sukhu has started the work of giving preference to general workers
 isko lekar party ke kuch diggajon main bechaini bhi he
 The party's new influential Rajni Patil has kept the organization tight
 unhone nae-puraane, chote-bade, sabhi netaaon ko modi sarkaar ke khilaaf sadakon par utaara he
 The Congress's defeat in the assembly elections has been just nine months, but the hank with which the Congress Kunba is taking to the streets indicates the party's tough attitude for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki party main abhi bhi netritv kii ladaai jari he
 The party has so far been dominated by former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh
 lekin purv kendriya mantri anand sharma bhi jor-aajamaaish karte rahe hai
 When Virbhadra Singh was made Chief Minister in the 2012 assembly, Sukhvender Sukhu, a supporter of Anand Sharma, became party president
 sukhu sanghathan main nai yuva ko team ko panaah dete gaye
 Now when the Congress minister or the heavyweights sitting on creamy posts in boards and corporations lost in the last assembly election, the Virbhadra camp became weak
 haarane vaale kaul ngkshasah or ji

 However, former ministers Asha Kumari and Mukesh Agnihotri won the elections
 jab virbhadra kheme ne congress vidhayak dal ke netaa ke rup main mukesh ko chunaa, to bataur party adhyaksh sukhu ne sanghathan main dbralak se jila str tak apni nai team khadi kar di
 At the same time, Vikramaditya, son of Virbhadra Singh, also has great aspirations

 The Virbhadra camp wants to remove Sukhu from the post of party president before the Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin anand khemaa aisi sthiti main bhi apana mohara baithaana chahta he
 But the way Sukhoo kept the organization active and made a strategy for the attack on the central government, it is possible that the Lok Sabha elections would be fought under his chairmanship
 congress rajya main digital taur par bhi mustaid he
 It has also formed teams at the booth and block level, which have been connected through mobile

 lekin mandi seat par virbhadra parivaar kaa acha-khaasaa asar dikhaa
 This time, Sukhram has joined BJP from Mandi, which has the potential to reverse the stakes of the Virbhadra family
 vahiin congress raaj main virbhadra ne bhaajapa ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke bade mudde uthaae the
 But till now Congress has nothing to speak against Jayaram government
 haalanki congress ke pradesh pravaktaa naresh chaihaan kehete hai, ''hamane kai nae wing banaae hai
 Farmer farming, worker wing etc
 through which we are in contact with people
 ham pradesh main badhate nashe ke khilaaf bol rahe hai or kharaab sadak vyavastha par bhi
 Congress is looking for new people for the Lok Sabha elections
 party adhyaksh kehete hai ki iske liye aantarik survey chal rahaa he

 lords main pakistan or england ke bich test match khelaa ja rahaa he
 Pakistan's captain is playing here for the first time and in his very first Test, misbah-ul-haq scored a century
 unhone 114 ran banaae
 With this, Misbah has now become the Pakistani captain with the most centuries
 unhone injamaam ul haq ke record ko todaa he
 This is the eighth century of Misbah as captain
 injamaam ul haq ne saat shatak jade the
 According to cricket records, Misbah is not the first Pakistani captain to score a century on Lord's
 unase pehle javed barki or injamaam ul haq bhi lords par shatak jamaa chuke hai
 Then the captaincy of the team was also in the hands of both of them
 test centuri thokane vaale sabase umradraj captanlords main shatak ke saath hi misabah ul haq ne ek or record apane naam kar liya
 Missbah is 42 years 47 days old
 umr kii lihaaj se ab misabah test shatak lagane vaale cricket itihaas ke sabase umradraj cricketer hai
 He has broken the record of Australian captain Bob Simpson
 simpasan ne bharat ke khilaaf 1977-78 main 41 saal 359 dinon kii umr main shatak thoka tha
 Also, Misbah has made six centuries since he crossed the age of 40
 cricket record ke mutabik misabah ke alaava koi bhi anya captain 40 kii umr paar karne ke baad teen se adhik shatak nahin bana sakaa he
 This is Pakistan's seventh Test match at Lord's on the Lords at 133rd Test
 england inamen se 51 test jeet chukaa he
 In 30 matches, the foreign team won here while 49 matches were drawn
 misabah kaa shatak lords par banaaya gaya 235waan shatak he
 With this century, Misbah became the seventh Pakistani cricketer to score a century on Lord's ground
 lords ke maidan par shatak jadne vaale pehle pakistani cricketer javed barki hai jo us test main team kii captaini bhi kar rahe the
 The test began on 21 June 1962
 isi test main naseem-ul-ghani ne bhi shatak jadaa tha
 Pakistan captain's 43rd century: In Pakistan cricket, so far Pakistani captains have scored a total of 43 centuries
 misabah ul haq or injamaam ul haq ke baad sabase adhik shatak jadne vaale captain imran khan or javed minyaadaad hai
 Both of them have scored five five centuries as captain
 hanif mohammad ne chaar, saleem malik or mushtak mohammad ne teen teen to younis khan ne apni captaini main do shatak jade hai
 At the same time, Zaheer Abbas, Wasim Akram, Saeed Anwar, Mohammad Yusuf, Aamir Sohail and Javed Barki have scored one century each as captain
 sarvaadhik shatak kaa record younis khan ke namlords main apana 105waan test khel rahe pakistan ke middle order batsman younis khan ke naam he sabase zyada shatak lagane vaale pakistan cricketer kaa record
 He has so far scored 31 Test centuries for Pakistan
 younis ke baad 25 shatakon ke saath injamaam duusare jabaki 24 shatakon ke saath mohammad yusuf tisare number par hai
 After this comes the number of Pakistani Little Master Javed Miyanadad who has scored 23 centuries
 is list main chauthe sthaan par saleem malik kaa naam he jinhone 15 test shatak jade hai
 At number five are Zaheer Abbas, Hanif Mohammad and Ijaz Ahmed with 12 Test centuries
 vahiin said anwar or asif ikbaal ne 11 test shatak to mustaa mohammad or mudassar najar ne misabah ke baraabar hi 10 test shatak jade hai
 Javed Barki had scored the first Test century
 In October 1952, the Pakistani team, which played the first Test, had to wait for the next 10 years for their captain's century
 is dauraan pakistan ne 38 test khele lekin koi bhi captain apane score ko tihare ank tak le jane main kaamyaab nahin hua
 For the first time, Pakistan's captain hit a century on Lord's ground
 tab javed barki ke netritv main team england ke daure par gai thi
 After Barki and before Misbah only Inzamam ul Haq has scored a century on Lord's as captain
 kul milakar lords par shatak banane vaale misabah keval tisare captain hai
 Pakistan did not lose Test on Misbah's century, another special thing which can affect the outcome of this match
 jin aath maichon main misabah ne bataur captain shatak banaae unamem se chah mukaable pakistan kii jholii main gaye hai
 There was a match draw
 itnaa hi nahin, jin test maichon main misabah ne apni team ke liye shatak banaae hai unamem se ek bhi pakistan nahin haara he
 Misbah scored two Test centuries before getting the captaincy
 donon hi bharat ke khilaaf or ye drow rahe
 Overall, Pakistan has not lost a match when missbah-ul-haq has scored a century in Test cricket

 Before sting against any government official or employee, it is necessary to tell the police or (anti Corruption Branch) about this, so that the purpose of the sting is not questioned

 rajasthan bijepi ke pramukh madan laal saini itihaas kaa galat hawala dene kii vajah se trol ho rahe hai
 According to Saini, there was a discussion between Humayun and Babar about the cow
 saini ke mutabik mughal badshaah humayun jab mrityushaiya par the tab unhone babar ko bulaakar kaha tha ki agar tumhen hindustan par raaj karnaa to teen chizon kaa dhyaan rakhana
 Cow, Brahmin and woman
 inkaa apmaan nahin hona chahie
 Hindustan does not tolerate them
 in kaa sammaan hona chahie
 Saini is being mocked on social media because Babar died earlier
 humayun kii mrityu 25 saal baad 1556 main hui thi
 Was what the BJP leader said was completely wrong? India Today's Fact Check team researched articles and documents related to the Mughals and tried to find out from the historians what the policy was about cows at that time
 (or testament) was told, referring to this
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki us kitaab main babar kii ore se bete humayun ko gohatya ke khilaaf aagaah karne kaa zikr he
 But there is also a warning about the book that it is fake
 babar or humayun donon 16veen sadi main sakriy rahe, jabaki kathith ‘vasaaya’ shahjahan kii badshahath ke dauraan ai bataai gai
 According to experts, this book was brought out so that more support could be given for a complete ban on cow slaughter, citing that this ban was in force even at the beginning of Mughal rule
 itihaaskaaron ke mutabik babar kii jeevani ‘tujuk-i-babari’ main gohatya kaa koi zikr nahin he
 It only states that cow is considered sacred in India
 isse ye saaf nahin hota ki mughal badshaah ne gohatya par puri tarah pratibandh lagaaya tha
 The rule of Babur's son Humayun was in great turmoil
 humayun kii jeevani ‘humayunnama’ main bhi gohatya ko lekar koi sidhaa zikr nahin he
 However, the book 'tejkereh-al-vakiyat' by a Khidmatgar Johar of the Emperor mentions the personal memoirs of the Mughals
 british east india company ke major charles stuart ne iskaa anuwaad kiya tha
 It highlights the question of the cow
 johar ne ek ghatana kaa zikr kiya he jisamen humayun ne saaf taur par gohatya kaa virodh kiya tha
 The book states that beef was served at dinner on behalf of Humayun after expelling rebellious brother Kamran from the city of Kabul
 kitaab ke mutabik badshaah ne use khaane se manaa kar diya tha
 Humayun is quoted in the book as saying- Oh unfortunate Kamran! Was this your way of living? And did you feed the hideout of Pakijgi from the flesh of the cows? 
 
 ye khaanaa to un logon ke liye bhi sahi nahin jo hamaare walid kii kabr par intjaar karte hai
 Couldn't we, his four sons, honor his sign? Although historians doubt the British officer's ability to translate, there is still enough indication that the early Mughal emperors were against cow slaughter and beef eating
 akbar ke kaarykaal me gohatya par sakht pabandi thi
 It was also followed by his son Jahangir and grandson Shah Jahan
 ye sarvavidit he ki badshaah aurangzeb ne hinduonke khilaaf kattar rukh apanaaya tha
 Jay Gordon Melton, in his book 'faiths Across Time: 5,000 Years of Religious History', wrote that Aurangzeb killed a cow in the premises after desecrating a Jain temple
 visheshgy, haalanki is par shaq jataate he ki aurangzeb ne apane purvajon kii ore se gohatya par lagaaya gaya pratibandh hataa liya hoga
 Later in the Mughal period, documentary references are given regarding the ban
 badshaah farrukh sier kii hukumat ke dauraan bhi gohatya ke aarope main shahi adaalat main sunwaayee hone ke likhit sakshya maujuud hai
 There are also mentions that the ban on Bakrid was relaxed
 fact check se saaf he ki bijepi netaa ne farji dastavej kaa hawala dete hue jo kaha wo tathyaatmak taur par galat tha
 But at the same time it is also an established fact that cow slaughter was strictly prohibited during the Mughal period

 uri hamale ke baad se hi hindustan ke dil main laga jo zakhm lagaataar ris rahaa tha puure das rose baad jaakar us par thandak padi thi
 However, after this, it has raised the expectations of Awam from the government far more
 ummid ye ki ab baaki ke dushman bhi nahin bachenge
 The most recent address of enemy No
 1 Dawood Daud is a bungalow named D-13 in the Clifton area of karachi
 ikbaal kaaskarke ikbaalia bayaan ke baad ki daaud pakistan main hi he, is baat kii sambhaavna bad rahi he ki bharat daaud ko pakadaney yaa maarane ke liye koi bade plan ko anjaam de saktaa he
 Dawood's brother Iqbal Kaskar confessed to Dawood's presence in Pakistan in the arrest of Thane Crime Branch
 thane police kamishnar parambir singh ne bataaya ki ikbaal ne unhen bataaya he ki bharat kaa most wanted daaud pakistan ke karachi main rahata he
 He has four bungalows there
 1993 kaa mumbai dhamaakaa, yani pehla aisa aatankwaadi hamalaa, jisane pakistan ko sidhe katghare main khadaa kar diya tha
 Since then, this trend has continued continuously in the last 23 years
 naa jane hindustan ke kitne shahar jakhmi or chalni ho gaye
 But the terror coming to India through Pakistan did not stop
 darasal pakistan ko aatank kaa adda banane waalon main vahaan kii sarkaar se zyada fouj or iesai kaa haath rahaa he
 Dawood has been a favorite of the Pakistan Army and the ISI since the 1993 Mumbai blasts
 dushman number 2 haafiz saidathik isi tarah haafiz said bhi pakistan ke hi mureed ke ilaake main rah kar alag-alag naamon se dehshat kii dukaan chalaata he
 Let me tell you that since the surgical strike, Hafiz Saeed has changed his base from fear
 hafiz said apni jaan bachaane ke liye ghani bastiyon main logon ke bich ja chupa he
 The effect of India's surgical strike and international pressure is that Pakistan is no longer able to support Hafiz Saeed openly
 sutron ke anusaar pakistan ke punjab praant ke adhikariyon ne hafiz said kii najarbandi ek maheene ke liye badha di he
 Pak says that its activities are a threat to peace in the country
 bataa den ki jamaat-ud-daawa kaa pramukh said is saal ke 31 janvari se najarband he
 Along with Hafiz Saeed, the Punjab Home Department has extended the detention of four of its associates Abdullah Ubaid, Malik Zafar Iqbal, Abdul Rahman Abid and Qazi Kashif Hussain for 30 days with effect from 25 September
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main khabaren ai thi ki mumbai aatanki hamale kaa mastermindafiz saidka sanghathan jamaat-ud-daawa pakistan main swatantra he or pakistan main chunaav ladane kii yojana bana rahaa he
 In such a situation, the people of India are waiting that the Indian Army will take revenge for the Mumbai attacks by performing a surgical strike
 dushman number 3 masood ajharbahawalpur main madrason ke naam par hindustan kaa dushman number teen yani masood azhar pakistan se dehshatgardi kii dukaan chalaa rahaa he
 Jambaz commandos of the Indian Army had shown just a little trailer that the enemies of India sitting in Pakistan lost their sweat
 masood ajahar bhi sargical strike ke baad nae thikaane par rahane laga he
 According to sources, now both Hafiz Saeed and Masood have moved away from their madrassas and the organization's headquarters to live among the densely populated with a few select operatives
 iske peeche unki soch ye he ki ghani aabaadi ke bich rahanaa zyada mahfuj he
 The government is exploring new ways on this issue with China's continuing veto over attempts to ban Masood Azhar, the mastermind of the Pathankot attack and the mastermind of terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 bharat ke paas pathankot hamale kaa badla lene or jaish-e-mohammad jaise aatanki sanghathan par lagaam lagane ke liye sargical strike kaa opshan jarur maujuud he
 Like Osama, his elimination terrorist Osama bin Laden was killed by the American Navy Seal after entering his house
 wo din dur nahin jab hindustan bhi aisa hi oparation anjaam degaa or nishane par koi or nahin balki honge hindustan ke dushman number ek, do or teen yani daaud ibrahim, haafiz said or masood azhar
 By the way, these three have already been on the radar of Indian agencies
 lekin maujuuda sarkaar ne jis tarah pakistani karatuuton kii eent kaa jawaab pattharon se diya he, usase logon ko bhi ye ummid bandhane lagi he ki aaj nahin to kal, hindustan ke in teenon dushmano kaa hashr bhi vahi hoga, jo kabhi osama bin laden kaa hua tha

 The film 'rahasya', based on the well-known Aarushi Murder case in Noida, in which the slain child Ayesha plays the role of Sakshi Sem, Ashish Vidyarthi and Tisca Chopra as the doctor's parents and KK Menon is the CBI officer, Who are investigating Ayesha's murder
 'rahasy' ke shuru hote samay disclemur lagaaya gaya he, jiske mutabik yah ek kaalpanik kahani he
 Looking at the method of Taftish, this disclaimer may be correct, but looking at the story of 'mystery', it is clear that the film is based entirely on the Aarushi murder case
 aarushi ke mata-pita kii tarah 'rahasy' kii aesha ke mata-pita bhi doctor hai
 Like Aarushi's servant Hemraj, Ayesha's servant also has blood
 yahaan tak ki jis tarah ke rishton ke rahasy aarushi murder cese main sunai pade the, usee tarah ke kai rahasy is film main bhi dikhaae gaye hai
 Just as his parents are in jail for the murder of Aarushi, there is someone in the film too, but who is his, you have to watch the film
 haa, 'rahasy' ke prachaar ke samay kalakaaron ne bhi kabool kiya ki film aarushi hatyakand par aadhaarit he
 One thing has to be said that director Manish Gupta has kept the film engaging
 suspence acha he or pehla half khaastaur se ksaa hua he
 Taftish has been given good twists and Ashish Vidyarthi and KK Menon have done well
 lekin film kaa doosraa hissaa thodaa khinchaa hua lagata he, or climex kuch zyaada hi aasaani se khul jaataa he
 If you like to watch Murder Mystery, you can watch 'mystery' once, because knowing the decision of Aarushi Murder Case, you will not feel boredom in this film
 is film ke liye meri reating he - 3 star
