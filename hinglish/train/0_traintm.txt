 On seeing the white sheet of ice on the slope of Khumbu Glacier, it started bursting from many places
 pairon ke neeche thos barf dhansane lagi
 Any snow crack could swallow the climbers
 raste main bichhi is safed maut ke bich se nikalne ke liye tezi or sabar donon kii zarurat thi
 That's when the snowstorm passed from above
 
 
 
 Aamir told, when we were running down, a snow storm came with the run down, due to which we had to sit down and we covered our mouths
 jab hamane paanch minute ke baad apni ankhen kholin to hamaare upar paanch se das inch tak barf jamaa thi
 Now we came downstairs, when we reached the base camp, there was our Rakesh Solanki sir, who covered the base camp
 base camp main jo upar se himaskhalan hua tha, vah utarkar base camp par aa gaya
 
 
 Aamir said, for two minutes we felt like we were waiting for death with our eyes closed
 khumbhu glacier par jab aap khadey hon or aapke chaaron ore se barf kii chattaane gir rahi hon or aap jis glacier par khadey hon, vah bhi hill rahaa he to aap soch sakate hai hamane maut ko kitne qareeb se dekha he
 Major Jamwal in the Indian Army said, when we reached the bottom, we saw everything was safe
 kuch nahin bachaa he
 We had nothing left of ourselves
 hamaari bagal main echaare he, vahaan par cazmultiz lagaataar aani shuru ho gai thim
 There was a scream around Everest Base Camp
 rakesh solanki ne bataaya, ham saat se aath log neeche the
 Then at around 12:40 Earthquake arrived
 jaise ham log baahar tent se nikle or dekh hi rahe the, maine camera nikaal kar shooting karnaa shuru hi kiya tha ki utane main hamaare saamne bahut nazadik puraa barf kaa ek pahaad tut chukaa tha or vah hamaari taraf aane laga
 We left the camera right then and ran to save our lives
 mujhe ek choti-si chattan mil gai
 i sat behind him
 vahaan par main or ek sherpa bache
 The whole tent came and fell on us, that is why our shelter was done and we were saved
 vah sab jaise hi khatm hua to turant hamane camera nikaala
 When i started shooting, i saw everything was destroyed and the base camp was in very bad condition
 bahut zyada log ghayal hue the, sir kii choton se qareeb 22 log maare ja chuke the
 Major Jamwal said that no one had expected that inside the base camp, that too would be an avalanche from Pumori that would blow up the base camp
 iske baad mount everest base camp bikharaa padaa tha
 The climbers' tents were devastated by the snowstorm
 khaane-pine se lekar parvatarohan tak kaa saamaan saikadon meter dur kahin barf main dab chukaa tha
 Then the process of the arrival of the injured started
 bhartiya sena kaa abhiyaan dal turant raahat or bachaav main jute gaya
 Major Jamwal told that, we divided ourselves into two teams
 maine ek doctor kii team banaai
 He shared eight men with him
 
 
 or baaki team ko maine apana saamaan dhundne ke liye lagaaya, jo ki bahut jaruri tha, kyonki hamaara sab kuch ud chukaa tha
 Actually, it was necessary to collect scattered things in the storm
 ye saamaan vahaan maujuud jidangiyon ko bachaae rakhane kii door tha
 Only the injured could be treated
 sena kii team ne ek-ek kar sab jutaya
 Tents were renovated
 kuch hi der main bhartiya sena kaa field hospital shuru ho gaya tha
 According to Major Jamwal, we had a lot of medicines
 echaare se bhi zyaada davaaiyaan hamaare paas thi
 We had very capable doctors and they helped a lot
 puri raat hamaara doctor ghayalon saath rahaa
 He was handling the head injuries department, which was a main department, as most of the climbers suffered head injuries
 barf kaa toofaan apane saath chattaane or pathar todakar jo laayaa tha
 After this, the work of sending climbers who received serious injuries through helicopters immediately sent them to the capital Kathmandu or the nearest hospital in Lukla
 himaskhalan ke baad base camp par maujuud kai sherpa apni tiimon ko chhodkar waapas nikal gaye
 There were two reasons for this
 ek to ye ki himaskhalan main maare gaye 22 parvatarohiyon main se 16 sherpa the or doosraa nepal main ai tabaahi main kaiyon ke ghar afat tut padi thi
 Aamir told that after that when we came down, all the Sherpas were leaving the base camp as soon as we came down, because last year there were 16 Sherpa deaths in the avalanche
 is saal bhi vahi hua
 16 out of 19 were Sherpas
 saare ke saare sherpa jab bhaagane lage to saare parvatarohi hi bache rah gaye
 Climbers don't know that much
 is bich kai videshi parvatarohiyon kii timen ab bhi base camp par nahin lauti thim, jo parvatarohi ek do din pehle hi everest kii ore chadhaai kar chuke the, sabko unka intazaar tha
 Everest's base camp was cut from Camp One Camp Two
 sabko waapas lautne kii jaldi thi, nahin thi to sirf bhartiya sena ke abhiyaan dal ko
 Aamir told that the Indian Army played a great role here
 ve bhi nikal sakate the, lekin nahin nikle, kyonki vahaan par jo log fanse hue the, pehle unhen dhundhakar kar raahat pahunchnaa jaruri tha, kyonki kisi ke paas koi khaanaa-pinaa nahin bachaa tha
 Only the food that was left with the Indian Army was distributed
 base camp par kuch videshi parvatarohiyon ke saath bhartiya sena morcha sanbhale rahi
 The war of life continued at Everest Base Camp
 everest base camp par utre barf ke toofaan main jo batch gaye wo bhagwaan kaa shukriya adaa kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, small earthquakes coming one after the other were frightening everyone
 bukamp ke saath hi sabaki nigaah oonchi chotiyon par chali jaati ye dekhne ke liye ki kahin phir maut barf ke toofaan kii shakl main neeche to nahin utar rahi
 Major Jamwal told, we are on sentry duty
 agar koi aisi awaz aati he, teenon taraf, aap pomori kii baat kar sakate hai, lola kii baat kar sakate hai yaa nubse kii, jis taraf se bhi avalanche aayega, ye ladke hamen saavdhaan karenge
 The first day passed as usual
 agali subah bache hue logon ko nikaalane kaa kaam phir shuru hua
 Meanwhile, in the afternoon another big earthquake shook everyone
 dharti ke baad ab aasmaan kii baari thi
 The base camp was surrounded by clouds and snowfall started
 aamir ne bataaya ki lagaataar barfbaari ho rahi tha
 Tremors were coming in every day and night
 bhartiya sena teen santariyon ko lagaakar rakhti thi, jo raat bhar camp ke aasapaas rahete the
 As soon as the voice of Evlansh was coming, they used to shout at us, get out
 
 
 to ham shelter dhundte the
 Used to bow in front of the stone
 tippaniyan Gradually, the remaining teams at the base camp began to consolidate their operations, but the Indian Army expedition was still engaged in relief and rescue work at the base camp
 is bich base camp se hamaare lautne kaa vaqt bhi aa gaya
 With good heart, we bid farewell to the colleagues present there
 25 april, 2015 ko everest base camp kii wo syah yaad hameshaa dimaag main tazaa rahegi, lekin ham lautenge ek nae haunsale ke saath, ek nayaa mukaam, ek nai oonchai hasil karne ke liye
 
 
 Aamir Rafiq of NDTV said that right now we were with 30 people of Indian Army at Everest Base Camp
 ham base camp-1 tak hi gaye the
 While we were returning, the Khumbhu Glacier, which is considered the most dangerous world, started moving
 hamaare left-rhite donon sids se himaskhalan hone laga or puri army kii team jo major jamwaal kii leadership main thi, kaha ki aap rope pakadakar rakho or neeche raho
 We stayed for two minutes and waited for some time
 
 
 
 We are about to die now
 
 
 tabhi kisi ne kaha, bhaago-bhaago
 
 
 
 khumbhu glacier kii dhalaan par barf kii safed chadar dekhte hi dekhte kai jagah se fatne lagi
 Solid snow began to sink under the feet
 koi bhi him daraar parvatarohiyon ko nigal sakati thi
 It took both speed and patience to get out of the midst of this white death on the way
 tabhi upar se barf kaa toofaan guzara
 
 
 
 aamir ne bataaya, jab ham neeche bhaag rahe the to neeche bhaagane ke saath barf kaa tufaan aayaa, jisaki vajah se hamen neeche baithna padaa or hamane apana munh dhakaa
 When we opened our eyes after five minutes, we had five to ten inches of snow
 ab ham neeche bhaag-bhaag ke aae, jab ham base camp par pahunche, vahaan par hamaare rakesh solanki sar the, jinhone base camp ko cover kiya
 The avalanche that took place at the base camp landed and landed at the base camp
 
 
 aamir ne kaha, hamen do minute ke liye laga jaise ham aankh band karke maut kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 When you are standing on the Khumbu Glacier and there are rocks of snow falling around you and the glacier you are standing on is also shaking, then you can imagine how close we have seen to death
 bhartiya sena main major jamwaal ne bataaya, jab ham neeche pahunche to hamane dekha sab safaa he
 there's nothing left
 hamaara khud kaa kuch nahin bachaa tha
 We have HRA on our side, Casualties started frequenting there
 everest base camp par chaaron ore cheekh pukaar machi thi
 Rakesh Solanki told, We were seven to eight people down
 tabhi qareeb 12:40 par arthquek aa gaya
 As we got out of the tent and were watching, i started shooting out by taking out the camera that in that way a mountain of snow was broken very near to us and it started coming towards us
 ham usee vaqt camera vahiin chhodkar apni jaan bachaane ke liye daude
 i found a small rock
 uske peeche main baith gaya
 i and a Sherpa survived there
 hamaare upar puraa tents aakar gir gaya, isi vajah se hamaara shelter ho gaya or ham batch gaye
 As soon as that was over, we immediately took out the camera
 shoot karnaa start kiya tha to dekha sab tabah ho chukaa tha or base camp main bahut hi bure haal the
 Many people were injured, around 22 people were killed due to head injuries
 major jamwaal ne bataaya ki kisi ne ye expect nahin kiya tha ki base camp ke andar vah bhi pumori se aisa himaskhalan hoga, jo base camp ko uda ke le jayega
 After this, Mount Everest Base Camp was scattered
 parvatarohiyon ke tambu barf ke toofaan main ujaad chuke the
 Everything from food to drink to mountaineering was buried in ice somewhere hundreds of meters away
 phir ghayalon ke aane kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 The expedition team of the Indian Army immediately engaged in relief and rescue
 major jamwaal ne bataaya, hamane apane aapako do tiimon main baanta
 i made a doctor's team
 uske saath aath bande baante
 
 
 And i engaged the rest of the team to find our luggage, which was very important, because our everything had flown
 darasal, toofaan main bikhri chizein jutanaa zaruri tha
 These goods were the door to keep the lives alive there
 ghayalon kaa ilaaj bhi tabhi ho paata
 The army team collected everything one by one
 nae sire se tambu lagaae gaye
 The field hospital of the Indian Army was started shortly
 major jamwaal ke mutabik, davaaiyaan hamaare paas bahut thi
 We had more medicines than HRA
 hamaare paas bahut kaabil doctor the or unhone bahut help kii
 Our doctor was with the injured all night
 vah sir kii choton kaa department sambhaal rahe the, jo ek main department tha, kyonki adhiktar parvatarohiyon ko sir par chot lagi thi
 The snowstorm that he brought by breaking rocks and stones
 iske baad helicopteron ke jariye jin parvatarohiyon ko gambhir chotein ain, unhen turant rajdhani kathmandu yaa sabase qareeb lukala ke aspataal bhejne kaa kaam shuru hua
 After the avalanche, many Sherpas at the base camp left their teams and withdrew
 isaki do vajah raheen
 One is that out of the 22 climbers killed in the avalanche, 16 were Sherpas and the other was the devastation in Nepal in which many houses were broken
 aamir ne bataaya ki uske baad jab ham neeche aae to neeche utarate hi jitne bhi sherpa the, saare ke saare sherpa base camp chhodkar nikalne lage, kyonki pichley saal himaskhalan main 16 sherpa kii mautein huin thim
 The same thing happened this year
 19 main se 16 sherpa the
 When all the Sherpas started running, only the climbers were left
 parvatarohiyon ko utani jaankaree nahin hoti
 Meanwhile, many foreign mountaineer teams have still not returned to the base camp, which climbers had climbed towards Everest a couple of days before, all were waiting for them
 everest kaa base camp, camp van camp tu se cat chukaa tha
 Everyone was in a hurry to return, if not the Indian Army expedition
 aamir ne bataaya ki bhartiya sena ne yahaan great role nibhaayaa
 They could also leave, but did not leave, because those who were trapped there, it was necessary to find relief by finding them first, because no one had any food and drink left
 sirf indian army ke paas jo khaanaa bachaa tha vah baanta gaya
 The Indian Army front with some foreign climbers at the base camp
 everest base camp par zindagi kii jang jari thi
 Those who survived the snow storm landed at Everest Base Camp, thanking God
 is bich ek ke baad ek aa rahe chote bukamp rah rahakar sabko daraa rahe the
 With the earthquake, everyone's eyes would go to the higher peaks to see if death was coming down in the shape of snow storm
 major jamwaal ne bataaya, hamane santari duty par lagaae hue hai
 If there is such a voice, on all three sides, you can talk about Pomori, you can talk about Lola or Nubsey, which way Avalansh will come, these boys will warn us
 pehla din jaise-taise guzara
 The next morning, the work of evacuating the survivors resumed
 is bich dopaher main ek or bada bukamp sabko dahala gaya
 After the earth, it was now the turn of the sky
 base camp ko badalon ne gher liya or barfabaari shuru ho gai
 Aamir told that it was snowing continuously
 har din or raat ko traders aa rahe the
 The Indian Army employed three sentries, who lived around the camp overnight
 jyon hi avalanche kii awaz aa rahi hoti to ve hamen chilla ke bolte the, baahar niklo
 
 
 So we used to find shelter
 pathar ke saamne jhuk jate the
 The comments dhire-dhire base camp par bachi tiimon ne apana abhiyaan sametanaa shuru kiya, lekin bhartiya sena kaa abhiyaan dal base camp par raahat or bachaav ke kaam main ab bhi juta tha
 Meanwhile, the time has come for our return from base camp
 bhare man ke saath hamane vahaan maujuud saathiyon se vidaa lee
 That dark memory of Everest Base Camp on April 25, 2015 will always be fresh in the mind, but we will return with a new spirit, a new place, a new height

 The field hospital of the Indian Army was started shortly

 Our doctor was with the injured all night

 After the avalanche, many Sherpas at the base camp left their teams and withdrew
 isaki do vajah raheen
 One is that out of the 22 climbers killed in the avalanche, 16 were Sherpas and the other was the devastation in Nepal in which many houses were broken
 aamir ne bataaya ki uske baad jab ham neeche aae to neeche utarate hi jitne bhi sherpa the, saare ke saare sherpa base camp chhodkar nikalne lage, kyonki pichley saal himaskhalan main 16 sherpa kii mautein huin thim
 The same thing happened this year
 19 main se 16 sherpa the
 When all the Sherpas started running, only the climbers were left
 parvatarohiyon ko utani jaankaree nahin hoti
 Meanwhile, many foreign mountaineer teams have still not returned to the base camp, which climbers had climbed towards Everest a couple of days before, all were waiting for them
 everest kaa base camp, camp van camp tu se cat chukaa tha
 Everyone was in a hurry to return, if not the Indian Army expedition
 aamir ne bataaya ki bhartiya sena ne yahaan great role nibhaayaa
 They could also leave, but did not leave, because those who were trapped there, it was necessary to find relief by finding them first, because no one had any food and drink left

 The Indian Army front with some foreign climbers at the base camp
 everest base camp par zindagi kii jang jari thi
 Those who survived the snow storm landed at Everest Base Camp, thanking God

 With the earthquake, everyone's eyes would go to the higher peaks to see if death was coming down in the shape of snow storm
 major jamwaal ne bataaya, hamane santari duty par lagaae hue hai
 If there is such a voice, on all three sides, you can talk about Pomori, you can talk about Lola or Nubsey, which way Avalansh will come, these boys will warn us
 pehla din jaise-taise guzara
 The next morning, the work of evacuating the survivors resumed

 After the earth, it was now the turn of the sky
 base camp ko badalon ne gher liya or barfabaari shuru ho gai
 Aamir told that it was snowing continuously
 har din or raat ko traders aa rahe the
 The Indian Army employed three sentries, who lived around the camp overnight
 jyon hi avalanche kii awaz aa rahi hoti to ve hamen chilla ke bolte the, baahar niklo
 
 
 So we used to find shelter
 pathar ke saamne jhuk jate the
 The comments dhire-dhire base camp par bachi tiimon ne apana abhiyaan sametanaa shuru kiya, lekin bhartiya sena kaa abhiyaan dal base camp par raahat or bachaav ke kaam main ab bhi juta tha
 Meanwhile, the time has come for our return from base camp
 bhare man ke saath hamane vahaan maujuud saathiyon se vidaa lee
 That dark memory of Everest Base Camp on April 25, 2015 will always be fresh in the mind, but we will return with a new spirit, a new place, a new height
 
 
 rakesh solanki ne bataaya, ham saat se aath log neeche the
 Then at around 12:40 Earthquake arrived
 jaise ham log baahar tent se nikle or dekh hi rahe the, maine camera nikaal kar shooting karnaa shuru hi kiya tha ki utane main hamaare saamne bahut nazadik puraa barf kaa ek pahaad tut chukaa tha or vah hamaari taraf aane laga
 We left the camera right then and ran to save our lives
 mujhe ek choti-si chattan mil gai
 i sat behind him
 vahaan par main or ek sherpa bache
 The whole tent came and fell on us, that is why our shelter was done and we were saved
 vah sab jaise hi khatm hua to turant hamane camera nikaala
 When i started shooting, i saw everything was destroyed and the base camp was in very bad condition
 bahut zyada log ghayal hue the, sir kii choton se qareeb 22 log maare ja chuke the
 Major Jamwal said that no one had expected that inside the base camp, that too would be an avalanche from Pumori that would blow up the base camp
 iske baad mount everest base camp bikharaa padaa tha
 The climbers' tents were devastated by the snowstorm
 khaane-pine se lekar parvatarohan tak kaa saamaan saikadon meter dur kahin barf main dab chukaa tha
 Then the process of the arrival of the injured started
 bhartiya sena kaa abhiyaan dal turant raahat or bachaav main jute gaya
 Major Jamwal told that, we divided ourselves into two teams
 maine ek doctor kii team banaai
 He shared eight men with him
 
 
 or baaki team ko maine apana saamaan dhundne ke liye lagaaya, jo ki bahut jaruri tha, kyonki hamaara sab kuch ud chukaa tha
 Actually, it was necessary to collect scattered things in the storm
 ye saamaan vahaan maujuud jidangiyon ko bachaae rakhane kii door tha
 Only the injured could be treated
 sena kii team ne ek-ek kar sab jutaya
 Tents were renovated
 kuch hi der main bhartiya sena kaa field hospital shuru ho gaya tha
 According to Major Jamwal, we had a lot of medicines
 echaare se bhi zyaada davaaiyaan hamaare paas thi
 We had very capable doctors and they helped a lot
 puri raat hamaara doctor ghayalon saath rahaa
 He was handling the head injuries department, which was a main department, as most of the climbers suffered head injuries
 barf kaa toofaan apane saath chattaane or pathar todakar jo laayaa tha
 After this, the work of sending climbers who received serious injuries through helicopters immediately sent them to the capital Kathmandu or the nearest hospital in Lukla
 himaskhalan ke baad base camp par maujuud kai sherpa apni tiimon ko chhodkar waapas nikal gaye
 There were two reasons for this
 ek to ye ki himaskhalan main maare gaye 22 parvatarohiyon main se 16 sherpa the or doosraa nepal main ai tabaahi main kaiyon ke ghar afat tut padi thi
 Aamir told that after that when we came down, all the Sherpas were leaving the base camp as soon as we came down, because last year there were 16 Sherpa deaths in the avalanche
 is saal bhi vahi hua
 16 out of 19 were Sherpas
 saare ke saare sherpa jab bhaagane lage to saare parvatarohi hi bache rah gaye
 Climbers don't know that much
 is bich kai videshi parvatarohiyon kii timen ab bhi base camp par nahin lauti thim, jo parvatarohi ek do din pehle hi everest kii ore chadhaai kar chuke the, sabko unka intazaar tha
 Everest's base camp was cut from Camp One Camp Two
 sabko waapas lautne kii jaldi thi, nahin thi to sirf bhartiya sena ke abhiyaan dal ko
 Aamir told that the Indian Army played a great role here
 ve bhi nikal sakate the, lekin nahin nikle, kyonki vahaan par jo log fanse hue the, pehle unhen dhundhakar kar raahat pahunchnaa jaruri tha, kyonki kisi ke paas koi khaanaa-pinaa nahin bachaa tha
 Only the food that was left with the Indian Army was distributed
 base camp par kuch videshi parvatarohiyon ke saath bhartiya sena morcha sanbhale rahi
 The war of life continued at Everest Base Camp
 everest base camp par utre barf ke toofaan main jo batch gaye wo bhagwaan kaa shukriya adaa kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, small earthquakes coming one after the other were frightening everyone
 bukamp ke saath hi sabaki nigaah oonchi chotiyon par chali jaati ye dekhne ke liye ki kahin phir maut barf ke toofaan kii shakl main neeche to nahin utar rahi
 Major Jamwal told, we are on sentry duty
 agar koi aisi awaz aati he, teenon taraf, aap pomori kii baat kar sakate hai, lola kii baat kar sakate hai yaa nubse kii, jis taraf se bhi avalanche aayega, ye ladke hamen saavdhaan karenge
 The first day passed as usual
 agali subah bache hue logon ko nikaalane kaa kaam phir shuru hua
 Meanwhile, in the afternoon another big earthquake shook everyone
 dharti ke baad ab aasmaan kii baari thi
 The base camp was surrounded by clouds and snowfall started
 aamir ne bataaya ki lagaataar barfbaari ho rahi tha
 Tremors were coming in every day and night
 bhartiya sena teen santariyon ko lagaakar rakhti thi, jo raat bhar camp ke aasapaas rahete the
 As soon as the voice of Evlansh was coming, they used to shout at us, get out
 
 
 to ham shelter dhundte the
 Used to bow in front of the stone
 tippaniyan Gradually, the remaining teams at the base camp began to consolidate their operations, but the Indian Army expedition was still engaged in relief and rescue work at the base camp
 is bich base camp se hamaare lautne kaa vaqt bhi aa gaya
 With good heart, we bid farewell to the colleagues present there
 25 april, 2015 ko everest base camp kii wo syah yaad hameshaa dimaag main tazaa rahegi, lekin ham lautenge ek nae haunsale ke saath, ek nayaa mukaam, ek nai oonchai hasil karne ke liye
 
 
 i found a small rock
 uske peeche main baith gaya
 i and a Sherpa survived there
 hamaare upar puraa tents aakar gir gaya, isi vajah se hamaara shelter ho gaya or ham batch gaye
 As soon as that was over, we immediately took out the camera
 shoot karnaa start kiya tha to dekha sab tabah ho chukaa tha or base camp main bahut hi bure haal the
 Many people were injured, around 22 people were killed due to head injuries
 major jamwaal ne bataaya ki kisi ne ye expect nahin kiya tha ki base camp ke andar vah bhi pumori se aisa himaskhalan hoga, jo base camp ko uda ke le jayega
 After this, Mount Everest Base Camp was scattered
 parvatarohiyon ke tambu barf ke toofaan main ujaad chuke the
 Everything from food to drink to mountaineering was buried in ice somewhere hundreds of meters away
 phir ghayalon ke aane kaa silsilaa shuru hua
 The expedition team of the Indian Army immediately engaged in relief and rescue
 major jamwaal ne bataaya, hamane apane aapako do tiimon main baanta
 i made a doctor's team
 uske saath aath bande baante
 
 
 And i engaged the rest of the team to find our luggage, which was very important, because our everything had flown
 darasal, toofaan main bikhri chizein jutanaa zaruri tha
 These goods were the door to keep the lives alive there
 ghayalon kaa ilaaj bhi tabhi ho paata
 The army team collected everything one by one
 nae sire se tambu lagaae gaye
 The field hospital of the Indian Army was started shortly
 major jamwaal ke mutabik, davaaiyaan hamaare paas bahut thi
 We had more medicines than HRA
 hamaare paas bahut kaabil doctor the or unhone bahut help kii
 Our doctor was with the injured all night
 vah sir kii choton kaa department sambhaal rahe the, jo ek main department tha, kyonki adhiktar parvatarohiyon ko sir par chot lagi thi

 If there is such a voice, on all three sides, you can talk about Pomori, you can talk about Lola or Nubsey, which way Avalansh will come, these boys will warn us

 The next morning, the work of evacuating the survivors resumed

 iske baad helicopteron ke jariye jin parvatarohiyon ko gambhir chotein ain, unhen turant rajdhani kathmandu yaa sabase qareeb lukala ke aspataal bhejne kaa kaam shuru hua
 After the avalanche, many Sherpas at the base camp left their teams and withdrew
 isaki do vajah raheen
 One is that out of the 22 climbers killed in the avalanche, 16 were Sherpas and the other was the devastation in Nepal in which many houses were broken
 aamir ne bataaya ki uske baad jab ham neeche aae to neeche utarate hi jitne bhi sherpa the, saare ke saare sherpa base camp chhodkar nikalne lage, kyonki pichley saal himaskhalan main 16 sherpa kii mautein huin thim
 The same thing happened this year
 19 main se 16 sherpa the
 When all the Sherpas started running, only the climbers were left
 parvatarohiyon ko utani jaankaree nahin hoti
 Meanwhile, many foreign mountaineer teams have still not returned to the base camp, which climbers had climbed towards Everest a couple of days before, all were waiting for them
 everest kaa base camp, camp van camp tu se cat chukaa tha
 Everyone was in a hurry to return, if not the Indian Army expedition
 aamir ne bataaya ki bhartiya sena ne yahaan great role nibhaayaa
 They could also leave, but did not leave, because those who were trapped there, it was necessary to find relief by finding them first, because no one had any food and drink left
 sirf indian army ke paas jo khaanaa bachaa tha vah baanta gaya

 himaskhalan ke baad base camp par maujuud kai sherpa apni tiimon ko chhodkar waapas nikal gaye
 There were two reasons for this
 ek to ye ki himaskhalan main maare gaye 22 parvatarohiyon main se 16 sherpa the or doosraa nepal main ai tabaahi main kaiyon ke ghar afat tut padi thi
 Aamir told that after that when we came down, all the Sherpas were leaving the base camp as soon as we came down, because last year there were 16 Sherpa deaths in the avalanche
 is saal bhi vahi hua
 16 out of 19 were Sherpas
 saare ke saare sherpa jab bhaagane lage to saare parvatarohi hi bache rah gaye
 Climbers don't know that much
 is bich kai videshi parvatarohiyon kii timen ab bhi base camp par nahin lauti thim, jo parvatarohi ek do din pehle hi everest kii ore chadhaai kar chuke the, sabko unka intazaar tha
 Everest's base camp was cut from Camp One Camp Two
 sabko waapas lautne kii jaldi thi, nahin thi to sirf bhartiya sena ke abhiyaan dal ko
 Aamir told that the Indian Army played a great role here
 ve bhi nikal sakate the, lekin nahin nikle, kyonki vahaan par jo log fanse hue the, pehle unhen dhundhakar kar raahat pahunchnaa jaruri tha, kyonki kisi ke paas koi khaanaa-pinaa nahin bachaa tha
 Only the food that was left with the Indian Army was distributed
 base camp par kuch videshi parvatarohiyon ke saath bhartiya sena morcha sanbhale rahi
 The war of life continued at Everest Base Camp
 everest base camp par utre barf ke toofaan main jo batch gaye wo bhagwaan kaa shukriya adaa kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, small earthquakes coming one after the other were frightening everyone
 bukamp ke saath hi sabaki nigaah oonchi chotiyon par chali jaati ye dekhne ke liye ki kahin phir maut barf ke toofaan kii shakl main neeche to nahin utar rahi
 Major Jamwal told, we are on sentry duty
 agar koi aisi awaz aati he, teenon taraf, aap pomori kii baat kar sakate hai, lola kii baat kar sakate hai yaa nubse kii, jis taraf se bhi avalanche aayega, ye ladke hamen saavdhaan karenge
 The first day passed as usual
 agali subah bache hue logon ko nikaalane kaa kaam phir shuru hua
 Meanwhile, in the afternoon another big earthquake shook everyone
 dharti ke baad ab aasmaan kii baari thi
 The base camp was surrounded by clouds and snowfall started
 aamir ne bataaya ki lagaataar barfbaari ho rahi tha
 Tremors were coming in every day and night
 bhartiya sena teen santariyon ko lagaakar rakhti thi, jo raat bhar camp ke aasapaas rahete the
 As soon as the voice of Evlansh was coming, they used to shout at us, get out

 But are the people now beginning to see villains in politicians? For this, India today-synovate conducted a poll of youth from five metros
 isamen ubharkar aae raajnneeti ke villen top 5
 Sharad Pawarmhangai grew like the mouth of Sursa, the prices of food items kept touching and the attitude of Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar remained irresponsible
 shahari yuvaaon ko lagata he ki pavaar khud to shahi jindagi jite hai, lekin jinaki rahanumai karte hai, unka koi khyal nahin rahete
 That is why the youth in the survey have called Pawar as Villain No
1 of politics
 jis vakt desh ke kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe the, tab krishi mantri sharad pavaar isisi or bisisiai kii raajnneeti main vyast the
 When the people of the country were groaning in the face of inflation, then Sharad Pawar was stating that he is not an astrologer
 sharad pavaar ke ye tevar desh kii yuva peedi ko behad nagavar gujarey hai
 In the India today-synovate survey, youths from five cities considered Sharad Pawar, the biggest villain of politics and 6 out of 10
 9 number diya he
 Sharad Pawar is considered a veteran of Maharashtra politics, but he is most disliked by the youth of Mumbai
 naapsandida netaaon ke survey main sharad pavaar ko sabase zyaada 8
 Number 1 was found in Mumbai only
 bangalore or kolkata ke yuvaaon ne bhi unhen villen number van mana, jabaki dilli ke naujavaanon kii najar main pavaar raajnneeti ke chauthe sabase bade khalanaayak hai
 Sharad Pawar, who has run the politics of the country and cricket from Maharashtra, will now have to think how to run a coin of confidence on the new generation of the country
 dinesh trivedidinesh trivedi ko rail mantri bane paanch maheene bhi nahin hue ki paanch rail haadase ho gayi
 Far from taking any concrete steps to prevent such accidents, he always kept a statement that hurt the heart of the victims
 rail mantri ke isi ravaie ne unhen desh ke paanch mahanagaron ke naujavaanon ke bich bana diya he raajnneeti kaa villen number 2
 India today-synovate's Hate Meter means 6 out of 10 youth in the list of disliked leaders
 74 number die
 The youth of Delhi disliked him the most and 8 out of 10
 57 number de daalaa
 He is second in Bangalore and fourth in the list of disliked leaders in Mumbai
 dinesh trivedi 2009 main pehali baar saansad bane or do saal baad cabinet mantri
 But the faster the speed of his political journey, the faster the anger of the youth has increased
 manmohan sinhamhanagareey yuvaaon kii najar main raajnneeti ke villen number 4 laal krishna adwani gaahe-bagaahe pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko sabase kamjor pradhanmantri kehete hai
 Incidentally, see that urban youth consider the same Manmohan Singh as Villain No
 3 of politics
 mahangaai or bhrashtachar ke masale par pradhanmantri kaa dhulmul ravaiya shahari yuvaaon ko raas nahin aata
 Manmohan Singh, considered economist but non-political, had high expectations from the people when he took over the reins of the country on 22 May 2004
 lekin bhrashtachar se lekar mahangaai tak har masale par inke deele-dhaale ravaiye or deree se kadam uthaane kii aadat se yuva inhen pasand nahin karte
 According to the indiatoday-synovate poll, the youth are not sure about Manmohan's trust and promise
 mahangaai aasmaan chhu rahi he or aarthik vikaas dar 7 fisadi ke neeche ludhakne lagi he
 That is why Manmohan has got 6 points for Villain in 10 points
 65 point
 Manmohan is the number two villain for the youth of Delhi and Kolkata
 is survey main manmohan desh ke teen mahanagaron- mumbai, kolkata or chennai main duusare sabase zyada naapsand kiye jane vaale netaa hai
 In the LK advaniindia today-synovate Public opinion poll, if the urban youth consider Gadkari as Villain number 5, the bjp's veteran leader also comes at number four
 ji haa, wo hai laal krishna adwani
 Advani's image in the eyes of urban youth is that of a leader who has neither a comprehensive view nor a concrete strategy to change the system
 84 saal kii umr main bhi rathyatra par nikal jane vaale bijepi ke vayovruddh netaa laalkrishna adwani ko desh kaa yuva varg villen maanata he
 Advani is the number 4 in the opinion of the youth of 5 metros in the age group of 18 to 25 in the India today-synovate poll
 naapsandi ke 10 point main unhen mila he 6
 36
 paanch mahanagaron main dilli, mumbai or bangalore main tisare number par sabase zyada naapsand kiye jate hai adwani to chennai main paanchaven number par
 Advani, who emerged as a hero of staunch Hindutva in the 1990s, may have been pointing to a change in his mind for some time, but this change has not left an impact on the youth
 yuvaaon kaa maananaa he ki kabhi piem in vatting rahe adwani ke paas desh ke liye koi thos or vaikalpik agenda nahin he or isiilie wo hai villen number 4
 Nitin Gadkari Villain is number 5 BJP President Nitin Gadkari
 shahari yuvaaon kii raay he ki korporate culture vaale gadakari naa to bijepi ko yuva peedi se jod paae, naa budhi ho chali rathyatra kii raajnneeti se use baahar nikaal paae
 While giving the command of BJP to Nitin Gadkari in 2009, the Sangh and BJP thought that the party led by Gadkari would easily catch the pulse of young India
 lekin lagata he ki gadakari naa to bijepi par pakad bana paae or naa hi yuvaaon ke dil main jagah
 The image also deteriorated due to his poor lyrics
 india today-sinovet ke tazaatreen survey main gadakari un top five netaaon main paanchaven number par hai, jinhen desh kii yuva peedi sabase zyaada naapsand karti he
 India today-synovate interviewed people aged 18 to 25 in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Bangalore, 6 among the list of most disliked leaders nationally
 04 number paakar paanchaven number par hai gadakari
 Nitin Gadkari has the responsibility of making the BJP shine in national politics, but the image of Gadkari is not good in the eyes of the youth only in Delhi, the political headquarters of the country
 dilli ke yuvaaon ne gadakari ko 10 main se 6
 Gave 95 numbers and made him second in the list of disliked leaders
 apane agalgau bhaashanon ke liye mashhoor gadakari ko ab sochna hoga ki wo yuvaaon ke dil main sulag rahi nafrat kii aag kaise bujhaaen
 Urban youth neither like Sonia Gandhi, nor Rahul Gandhi, neither Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi nor UP Chief Minister Mayawati
 lekin in sabamein agar yuvaaon ko koi sabase kam naapsand he to wo hai mayawati
 Do not change the colors of the country's leaders, but the thinking of the youth of the country is now changing rapidly
 congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi upi main mayawati ke khilaaf hunkaar bhar rahe hai, lekin india today-sinovet ke survey main shaamil yuvaaon ko rahul kii lalkaar se zyaada mayawati ke tevar pasand aa rahe hai
 While Rahul Gandhi is at number fourteen in the list of disliked leaders, Mayawati's number comes after him
 is survey main shaamil yuvaaon ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kaa graph or gira he
 In the India today-synovate survey, youths from five metros in the country have placed Sonia Gandhi at number 11 on their list of dislikes
 khaas baat ye he ki sonia kii list main sonia se ek kadam aage hai narendra modi, jo naapsandgi kii list main 10wein number par hai
 From this perspective, the image of Mayawati, which has become the center of criticism for its curiosity and idols, is better than the three Sonia, Modi and Rahul
 koi bhi aisa raajnneetik dal nahin he, jiske netaa shahari yuvaaon ko pasand aa rahe hai
 From Left to Lalu and Karunanidhi are included in the list of dislikes
 or to or, wo jayalalita bhi mahanagaron ke yuvaaon ko nahin suha raheen, jinhen haal hi main tamilnadu kii janata ne mukhyamantri kii kursi par bithaaya
 However, the opinion of the youth is also not good for the other leaders
 yuvaaon kii najar main prakaash karaat hai villen number sicks
 CPM general secretary Prakash Karat is considered to be the young face of the Marxist party, but the youth polled in the survey gave Karat 5 out of 10
 88 number dekar naapsandida netaaon main chatha number diya
 In the eyes of the youth, m Karunanidhi is the villain number seven in politics
 2-ji ghotaale ke nishaan karunanidhi ke ghar ke darvaaze tak dikh rahe hai
 The color of Karunanidhi's politics is most disliked by the youth of Chennai, while the youth of the rest of the metros have Karunanidhi 5 out of 10
 83 number dekar naapsandida netaaon kii list main saatven number par rakhaa he
 Jayalalitha is the villain of politics number 8 in the eyes of the youth
 tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri jayalalita bhi khush nahin ho saktin, kyonki naapsandida netaaon kii list main unka naam thik karunanidhi ke baad aata he
 Jayalalithaa was voted 5 out of 10 by the youth
 7 number dekar naapsandida netaaon main aathvin rank di he
 In the eyes of the youth, Home Minister p Chidambaram is Villain No
 9 of politics
 grih mantri pi chidambaram ke bare main bhi yuvaaon kii soch bahut acchhee nahin he
 The youth in the India today-synovate survey ranked Chidambaram at ninth among disliked leaders and ranked him 5 out of 10
 69
 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi is the villain number 10 of politics
 narendra modi apni kattarpanthi chhavi se baahar aane ke liye chatapata rahe hai, lekin vikaas purush banane kii unki chahat bhi mahanagaron ke naujavaanon ko lubhaa nahin rahi
 Narendra Modi 5 out of 10
 66 number ke saath naapsandida netaaon kii list main dasven sthaan par hai
 The list of dislikes includes Sonia Gandhi at number 11, Petroleum Minister Jaipal Reddy at number 12, RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav at number 13, Rahul Gandhi at number 14 and UP Chief Minister Mayawati at number 15
 india today-sinovet kaa ye survey is baat kaa ishaara he ki ab yuvaaon ko partiyon ke naare nahin lubhaate
 He likes the work of politicians, their honesty and cleanliness

 The BJP, which is trying to convince the veteran OBC leaders angry in Maharashtra and Pankaja Munde, is witnessing a big upsurge in the politics of Maharashtra
 shivasena-congress-ensipi kii sarkaar banane or maharashtra kii satta se bijepi ke dur hote hi party ke andar baghawat ke swar uthne lage hai
 Eknath Khadse and Pankaja Munde, considered to be the OBC face of the BJP in Maharashtra, have taken a rebel stance since the election, while Vinod Tawde has been silent
 isane maharashtra bijepi kii tension ko badha diya he or party damege control main jute gai he
 bjp's OBC face of BJP upset with Khadse's rebellion Eknath Khadse has been expressing his displeasure over some party leaders ever since the Maharashtra Assembly election results were out
 unhone ravivaar ko kaha tha ki agar party main meraa apmaan jari rahata he to mujhe duusare vikalpon par vichaar karnaa hoga
 Khadse also claimed that some BJP leaders and workers are responsible for the defeat of BJP candidates Pankaja Munde and Rohini Khadse
 bijepi netaa ekanath khadse ne mangalvaar koshivsena supremeo or maharashtra ke mukhyamantri uddhav thakrese mulaakaat kii
 Khadse spent about 40 minutes with CM
 isse pehle vah somvaar ko ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar se bhi mulaakaat kar chuke hai
 Not only this, Khadse has also held a meeting with Pankaja Munde, who is angry with BJP
 bataa den ki chunaav se pehle tikat bantwaare ke dauraan bhi ekanath khadse naaraaz ho gaye the or nirdaleey pratyaashee ke taur par apana namakan daakhil kar diya tha
 The party then gave his daughter Rohini Khadse a ticket from Muktainagar seat, but lost to Independent candidate Chandrakant Nimba Patil by 1957 votes
 yahi vajah he ki vipakshi dalon ke netaaon ke saath khadse kii mulaakaat ke siyaasi myne nikaale jane lage hai
 Pankaja Munde's power show yesterday: Pankaja Munde, who is handling the political legacy of Maharashtra bjp's strongman Gopinath Munde, has been rebelling since her election defeat to her cousin and NCP leader Dhananjay Munde from Parli seat
 pankaja munde 12 disambar ko apane pita gopinath munde kii jayanti par maharashtra kii siyasat main apni raajnneetik takat dikhaanaa chaahati hai, jisamen vah koi bada siyaasi faisla le sakati hai
 His supporters allege that some BJP leaders defeated Pankaja Mande in the election to end leadership in the OBC class and the party
 pankaja ne fasebuk post likhakar siyaasi sargarmi badha di thi
 He wrote, 'looking at the changed political environment, one needs to think what to do next
 Need to recognize your power
 mujhe swayan se baat karne ke liye 8-10 dinon kii jarurat he
 With this, he also removed the tag of 'BJP' from his Twitter profile
 iske baad se vah bijepi main sakriy nahin hai
 Pankaja Munde was also Nadrad from the BJP Core Committee meeting on Tuesday
 bijepi damege control main jutibhajpa netaa sudhir mungantiwar ke bataaya ki hamane party kii kor cameti kii baithak main ekanath khadse ke saath vichaar-vimarsh karne kaa nirnay liya, unki chintaaon par dhyaan diya jayega
 Khadse ji has given some evidence regarding the workers working against the BJP
 jisane bhi party ke khilaaf kaam kiya he use nishkasit kar diya jayega
 Thirty-six figures are believed to be between Pankaja Munde and Eknath Khadse's former CM Fadnavis in the state of Maharashtra
 vahiin, obisi varg ke kaddavar netaa maane jane vaale vinod taavade tikat katane ke baad se khamosh hai, jinase haal hi main ekanath khadse ne mulaakaat kii he
 It is believed that a political khichdi is brewing between these three OBC leaders
 maharashtra main bijepi teen obisi said linedrasal maharashtra main gopinath munde, ekanath khadse or vinod taavade kii vajah se bijepi ko obisi samudaay main paith banane main kamyaabi mili, lekin badakismati se 2014 main ek car haadase main munde kaa nidhan ho gaya
 His daughter Pankaja and Pritam then took over his legacy
 2014 main maharashtra main jab bijepi ne sarkaar banaai to pankaja munde, ekanath khadse or vinod taavade bhi mantri bane
 But these three OBC leaders have been completely sidelined from the scene of politics in Maharashtra for different reasons
 ekanath khadse or taavade ko party ne jahaan tikat nahin diya to vahiin pankaja munde chunaav haar gayi
 If we look at the current scenario of Maharashtra's politics, BJP does not see any major leader of OBC category
 lekin bijepi obisi ke itane bade votbank ko bina netritv ke nahin chhod sakati he
 That is why BJP has appointed Sudhir Mungantiwar and Bhupendra Yadav to convince Khadse and Pankaja Munde
 aise main dekhnaa he ki bijepi ke obisi chehre koun sa siyaasi kadam uthaate hai

 Attacking Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for his comments on Sir Creek, External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said on Friday that Modi should not 'compromise national interests' for electoral gains
 modi kii soochna ke strot par sawaal uthaate hue khurshid ne kaha ki bharat or pakistan sar creek samet kai samvedansheel muddon par vaarta kar rahe hai or ‘hamane unhen is vaarta ke bare main abhi tak kuch nahin bataaya he
 If someone is not telling them all this from across the border then how do they know all this
 ’modi ne buudhvaar ko pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko bataur ‘aam aadmi’ likhe ek patr main maang kii thi ki vivaadaaspad sar creek ko padosi desh ko nahin saunpa janaa chahie
 The Prime Minister's Office strongly denied the charge, terming the allegations as 'baseless' and 'mischievous'
 pradhanmantri karyaalay ne modi ke patr kaa jawaab dete hue kaha tha, ‘patr main lagaae gaye aarope ki sar creek ko pakistan ko saunpa jane vaala he, jhooth he
 The conclusion drawn by Modi on this alleged fact is also not correct
 ’myama kii teen divasiy yatra par aae khurshid ne yah bhi kaha ki modi ko apana dhyaan ‘chunaav par kendrit karnaa chahie or desh chalaane kaa kaam ham par chhod dena chahie
 The External Affairs Minister said that India and Pakistan have held composite talks and decided to do 'practical' work and Sir Creek is also an issue in these but Modi should know that these issues are not resolved overnight
 khurshid ne kaha, ‘lekin vah vaarta kaa matlab nahin jaanate

 The nation will never forget the martyrdom of Indira Gandhi, the first woman Prime Minister of the country
 31 aktubar, 1984 hi vah taarikh thi, jab indira gandhi desh kii ekta or akhandta ke liye qurbaan ho gayi
 Wednesday, October 31, 1984
 aktubar kii aakhri subah
 The weather has turned completely
 thand dilli main dastak de chuki he
 Light chill is blowing amidst the warm sunshine
 ek safadarajang bangale ke lon main chaaron taraf lage neem or imali ke pedo ke saath phool bhi khilakhilaa rahe hai
 1, Safdarjung has two bungalows inside its premises
 ek bangale main pradhanmantri kaa daftar or logon se milane-julne ke liye kai kamare hai, jabaki doosraa bangala pradhanmantri kaa privet quarter he, jisamen indira gandhi apane bete rajeev gandhi, bahu sonia gandhi or pote-potee rahul or priyanka ke saath rahati hai
 At this time the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her elder daughter-in-law Sonia Gandhi are present in the bungalow
 rajeev gandhi janvari 1985 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon kii taiyaari ke silsile main pashchim bengal ke daure par gaye hue hai, jabaki indira gandhi ke donon pote-potee priyanka or rahul gandhi subah-subah hi skool ke liye nikal chuke hai
 After sending Priyanka and Rahul to school, hugging Indira Gandhi walks for some time on the lawn
 66 saal kii umr hone ke baavjood wo naa sirf puri tarah feet hai balki paanchavin baar desh kii pradhanmantri banane kii taiyaari me juty hai
 Indira Gandhi often worked late at night and woke up at four in the morning
 wo akasar kaha karti thim ki chaar ghante kii neend bhi bahut hoti he, par 31 aktubar ko subah wo thodi der se sokar uthin
 In fact, she returned a day before the exhausting election rally in Orissa
 marning walk or routine yoga ke baad indira gandhi ab apane daftar jane ke liye taiyaar hone lageen
 This morning is special for them
 baahar compound main hi bane unke daftar main ek british patrkaar peter ustinov unka intazaar kar rahaa he
 Actually Peter is making a documentary on the life of Indira Gandhi
 or isi documentry ke liye wo indira gandhi kaa intervyuu karne ja rahaa tha
 Peter has returned to Delhi a day earlier after spending two days in the Orissa tour with Indira Gandhi
 chunki intervyuu kaa vaktt tay he or intervyuu ek documentry kaa hissaa, lihaja british patrkaar kii guzarish par indira gandhi apane daftar main hi mechap karwaane lagati hai
 Right now, Indira Gandhi was getting her makeup done when her personal secretary RK Dhawan arrived at the office
 unhen bhi is intervyuu ke bare main pehle se pataa tha
 The makeup of Indira Gandhi was completed shortly
 iske baad wo aarake dhawan ko saath lekar daftar se baahar nikali padin
 At 9:27 am, Indira Gandhi starts moving from her bungalow to her office on an Akbar Road
 ek ghante kaa intervyuu yaheen ricard hona he
 Indira is leading the way, while the Indian Tibet Border Police security guards and RK Dhawan are two-three steps behind them
 safadarajang bangale se ek akbar road daftar jane ke liye sirf ek get paar karnaa hota he or indira gandhi ab usee get kii taraf bad rahi hai
 Indira is slowly becoming closer to the gate
 unki raftaar se raftaar milaate hue suraksha guard or dhawan ab bhi peeche-peeche chal rahe hai
 Till now everything is quiet and silent and everything is happening as per the routine and time of the Prime Minister's Office
 9 bajkar 28 minute par indira gandhi get ke bilkul kareeb pahunchati hai
 Seeing them coming closer, both the security guards Satwant Singh and Beant Singh posted at the special gate are immediately alerted
 indira gandhi kii suraksha main philhal yahi donon akele sikh guard hai
 In fact, after Operation Blue Star in Amritsar's Golden Temple on 6 June 1984, all Sikh guards deployed under the protection of Indira Gandhi were removed
 aisa khufia agenciyon kii report ke baad kiya gaya tha, lekin jab indira gandhi ko ye baat pataa chali to unhone iskaa kadaa virodh kiya or sabhi sikh guards ko waapas bula liya
 Indira Gandhi has known guard Beant Singh at the gate for ten years
 ye unka favorit guard he, jabaki beant singh se kuch kadam kii duuri par khadaa satamvat singh pradhanmantri kii suraksha main sirf paanch maheene pehle hi aayaa he
 Just two months ago, after seeing Satwant Singh and Beant Singh at the Prime Minister's residence, someone had asked Indira Gandhi that despite her controversial decision to send an army to the Golden Temple, does she trust her Sikh security guards? Then Indira Gandhi gave this answer after looking at Beant Singh that as long as i have such Sikhs, i need not fear
 vahi beant singh satvant singh ke saath get par duty de rahaa tha
 Seeing Indira Gandhi coming closer to the gate, both of them suddenly get faster
 9 baj kar 29 minute par naarangi rang kii print sari pahanin indira gandhi ab get se mushkil se saat feet kii duuri par hai
 That is when Indira Gandhi's eyes hit the eyes of both the guards
 nazaren milte hi satvant or beant singh unhen namaste kahata he
 Indira Gandhi also answers both smilingly
 
 
 namaste
 This was the last word that came out of his mouth
 9 baj kar 30 minute par idha indira ne donon kii namaste kaa jawaab diya, udhi usee pal beant singh ne palak jhapakate hi apni qamar par lage point 38 bor kaa sarvice revolver nikaala or behad kareeb se ek ke baad ek teen goliyaan daag deen
 Indira Gandhi fell on the ground as soon as the bullet started, but before the security guards or RK Dhawan, who was accompanying her, could think anything, then Satwant Singh then turned his stenchon to the ground and swung towards Indira Gandhi and deposited in the magazine
 Emptied 27 bullets of 27
 is tarah desh kii ek mahaan netaa hameshaa ke liye ihalok ko tyagkar paralok sidhaar gayi
 The country is still indebted to the gratitude of Indira Gandhi

 Modi then greets the audience by shaking hands in his 'victory' sign style and then his roar begins with Bharat Mata's cheering
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav kii tarah ab modi ke mukhute unke chunaav prachaar main nahin dikhte
 This experiment was highly successful in the 2007 election

 He is taking more support from Google Plus and social networking sites and is also running Namo TV

 Not only this, where he used to give his speech in 20 minutes in the election rallies of 2007, in almost every meeting of this election he is giving hours of speech
 bhaashan dene ke dauraan vah pehle kii hi tarah janata se sidhaa samvaad jarur karte hai
 In order to deliver a speech from the stage, a new style of Modi is being seen
 jab janata kaa josh thodaa kam hota he to vah baayen haath se dahini hatheli par amitabh bachchan kii tarj par khud se ek tali bhi bajaate hai
 In between, he also performs a variety of gestures by placing his hands in the front

 surat main aisi hi ek chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karte hue modi kehete hai, ‘madam sonia, manmohan singh or yuvaraj, gujarat aane ke dar se tension main hai
 The tension is that while giving a speech, the words do not come out of their tongues
 isliye congress ke jo netaa bhaashan bhi de rahe hai to unke bhaashanon kii bhi 15 baar screening ho rahi he
 "in Bhavnagar, he pinches on the factionalism of the Congress leaders and says in a cricketing style," Cricket (election) match was taking place

 The umpire said let's send the vice-captain only
 is par uske kai khilaadi khud ko upakptain kehete hue maidan main aa gaye
 So this is the condition of the Congress
 ’modi apane bhaashanon main apni uplabdhiyaan bhi ginate hai
 He talks about the development work done in the area where he holds a rally and also explains to the people in detail about what he will do after winning the election

 As Dilip Vengsarkar left the mention of Dawood Ibrahim coming to the Indian cricket team's dressing room in Sharjah on Monday, new layers of verbal encounters between the country's most wanted terrorist and Kapil Dev began to emerge
 vengsarakar ke mutabik daaud ko kapil dev ne room se bhaga diya tha
 According to Javed Miandad i told Vengsarkar that Dawood is angry with Kapil Dev
 or us vakt team main rahe ravi shastri ne ab bataaya ki jaise hi kapil dev ko pataa chalaa ki daaud koun he, vah usase maafee maangane gaye
 Let us first know by quoting different people what happened at the Australasia Cup in Sharjah in 1987
 
 
 kamedian mahmud ke saath aayaa smagalangale din bharat or pakistan kaa match tha
 All the players of the team were in the dressing room after the practice session, while Kapil Dev was attending the press conference outside
 tabhi hindi filmon ke mashhoor kamedian mahmud ek shaks ke saath dressing room main pahunche
 This man was Dawood Ibrahim, who by that time was recognized as a popular smuggler
 koi bhi daaud ko nahin pahchaan paaya vengsarakar ke sivaay
 Vengsarkar comes from Mumbai and had seen Dawood's photo in the local media there
 jab vah mahmud ke saath najar aayaa, to vengsarakar kaa andaja yakeen main badal gaya
 On the other hand, when Mahmud introduced his friend to the Indian cricketers, he just said that he is my friend, he does business here in Sharjah and has brought a big offer for you all
 kya bolaa daudadaaud bolaa, agar aap kal pakistan ko haraa dete ho, to main sabhi players ko ek ek car duungaa
 Jaywant Lele was the manager of the team at that time
 vah bhi dressing room main maujuud the
 After hearing this offer, he asked Dawood, i am the manager, will i get a car too
 daaud muskuraate hue bolaa, haa haa tumhen bhi milegi
 Players found out which car was being offered, then the answer came Toyota Corolla, which was a very popular car at that time
 phir hui kapil kii entriye baatcheet chal hi rahi thi ki kapil press conference nipataakar dressing room main ghuse
 He wanted to talk to the players
 unki najar mahmud par padi
 Kapil said, Mahmud sir, you get out
 or phir daaud kii taraf ishaara kar vah bole,or ye koun he
 Let's walk outside
 kapil ke ye bol sunakar daaud dressing room se chupchaap baahar nikal gaya or bolaa, ye car cancel haa
 Why did Javed Miandad come, according to Vengsarkar, after this incident, Pakistani player Javed Miyanadad came to his dressing room
 unhone kaha ki kapil ko daaud se is tarah pesh nahin aana chahie tha
 Javed said, he does not know, he is Dawood Ibrahim
 usko kuch problem karegaa
 To this Vengsarkar replied that no problem can arise to Kapil
 na india main or na baahar
 On this entire episode, Kapil Dev says that i do not remember much
 koi tha jo team kaa nahin tha or jise maine baahar jane ko kaha
 Kapil confessed that Javed Miandad was also in the dressing room at that time
 ravi bole, kapil ne maangi maafeeis puure prakaran main twist tab aayaa, jab ravi shastri ne kaha ki haa kapil dev ne daaud ko baahar jane ke liye kaha tha, magar jab unpar smagaller kii pahchaan jaahir hui to kapil dev ne jaakar daaud se maafee maangi
 Ravi said yes, Dawood used to come often
 sharajah main bhi vah aayaa tha
 i came to know of it before his arrival and i slipped on the pretext of tea
 baad main kapil daaud ke paas gaye or maafee maangi
 Dawood used to be in every party of Sharjah, Spinner Maninder Singh, who was part of the team at that time, also said that Dawood was present not only in every match but also in every party happening there
 maninder ne kaha ki us vakt hamen phixing jaisi kisi cheez ke bare main pataa nahin tha or dressing room main aane jane waalon ko lekar koi pabandi jaisi cheez bhi nahin thi

 The letter was sent to Netaji's nephew Shishir Kumar Bose in remote Kolkata, but it was read before reaching there
 yah pehla khat nahin tha jise padhaa gaya tha
 Even before he was read, several Intelligence Bureau (IB) officers had quietly made copies of the letter and placed it in secret files belonging to the Bose family
 aadhi sadi se zyada samay tak isaki or aise tamaam patron kii pratiyaan kolkata sthit rajya ibi mukhyalay ke daraajon main band padi thim
 Recently, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs removed the issue of secrecy from it and has been kept in the National Archives of Delhi

 That is, for two decades between 1948 and 1968, the government had extensively spied the members of the Bose family
 sarkari jasoos us swatantraaa senaanee ke parijanon ke patr padhate or darj karte rahe jo 25 varsh tak nehru kaa rajnatik sahakarmi rahaa tha
 The detectives of the IB continued to chase the family members during their domestic and foreign visits and record the finer details of those they met and what they said
 yah nigaraanee bilkul usee tarj par thi jaisaa aaj kisi vaanchit aatankwaadi ke parivaar par rakhi jaati he-behad saghan, vyavasthit or satarkta bhari
 These revelations have shocked the Bose family

 Netaji and his family fought for freedom, then what was the need to keep an eye on him? ”anita bose-foff, the only daughter of Subhash Chandra Bose, is an economist in Germany

 She says, "my uncle (sharat Chandra Bose) was politically active till the fifties and was opposed to the then Congress leadership, but what surprises me is that my cousins are also under the scanner Whereas it did not make sense in terms of security

 Speaking on his anniversary last year, he promised that Netaji's files would be made public if his government came to power
 aaj ve sarkaar main hai lekin uski pratikriya bhi upie jaisi hi he
 On 2 February, the Prime Minister's Office told RTI activist Subhash Chandra Aggarwal that the inauguration of Netaji's files with the PMO "may prejudicially affect relations with other countries
" '' piemo ne bilkul aisa hi jawaab ''mishan netaji'' ko diya he
 This is a pressure group of some activists who have been fighting the battle to make these files public since 2006

 This was the time when Sharat Chandra and his younger brother Subhash Chandra Bose emerged as the leaders of the independence movement in Bengal

 It is known from this incident that once a CID officer seized a letter sent to Sharat Chandra in the middle and got a copy of it, but accidentally sent a copy to him
 jab vah apni galati ko swikaarne bose parivaar ke paas aayaa to bade bhai ne usase kaha ki kuch din baad aakar use le jaae
 Netaji was placed under house arrest in 1941

 The British then called him an ally of the fascist forces and increased surveillance on their families

 Netaji's two nephews Shishir Kumar Bose and Amiya Nath Bose did not have much political weight at the time they were being monitored
 dastavejon ke mutabik ibi ne jab un par apni nigaraanee dhili kar di thi, uske kai saal baad unhone chunaav ladaa
 Amiya Nath was elected as an MP from Arambagh in 1968 on the All India Forward Bloc ticket while Shishir Bose was elected MLA in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly in 1987 on a Congress ticket
 aisa lagata he ki ibi ko is baat main zyada dilchaspee thi ki bose parivaar kya karata he or kisase miltaa he
 a series of handwritten messages that have been made public show that IB agents used to call IB headquarters "security Control" to give information about the family's antics, although it was only through family letters that IB could find out what the family was doing
 Is thinking is patrachaar main netaji kaa zikr khub hota tha
 Obviously, what else would the family talk about? These letters were largely about general family issues
 netaji kii patni apane khaton main parivaar ke aarthik sankat, beti ke paalan-poshan or vienna vaale makaan kii marammat kaa zikr karti thim
 From Kolkata, the Bose family used to send them money for running the expenses

 This shows what Ib was interested in

 The response of Krishna Bose, 85-year-old wife of Marhum Shishir Kumar Bose, was overturned by the documents, which were made public in the house at 38 @ 2 Elgin Road, which has become the Netaji Bhawan Museum, "it is very mysterious and shocking!" After all, why did they want to follow us? ”she has been a three-time Lok Sabha MP from the Trinamool Congress

 She says, "my husband used to say that while going to the hospital or boarding the tram, he felt that he was being followed
" 
 
 par yah angrejon ke daur kii baat thi
 Looking at these detective revelations, one gets an idea of how an IB used to work in the world's oldest intelligence agencies

 Anuj Dhar, author and activist of India's Biggest cover-up, a book on the mysteries associated with Netaji, says, "when the Bhadralok of Bengal was taking a look at Byomkesh Bakshi, a fanciful man who solved petty crimes, the IB detectives were Among the exploits were Mubtila, in front of whom CIA and KGB would have had to fill water

 Despite this, Netaji had no ill-feeling about Nehru, eight years older than him
 ve unhen apana bada bhai maanate the or yahaan tak ki unhone iene kii ek regiment ko hi nehru ke naam par rakh diya tha
 Nehru publicly cried when he got the news of Bose's death in 1945

 After all, what did the Congress need to be skeptical about? Bose was the only charismatic leader who could unite the opposition against the Congress and pose a serious challenge in the 1957 elections
 yah kahana behatar hoga ki agar bose jinda hote to jis gathbandhan ne congress ko 1977 main haraaya, usne 1962 ke chunaav main yaa phir 15 saal pehle hi congress ko dhwast kar diya hota

 ye diariyaan 2012 main prakashit hui thim jisamen british aantarik suraksha sevaaon ke saath ibi ke nabhinal rishton kaa zikr tha
 The priority of MI5 was to keep an eye on the communists
 yahi viraasat ibi ko bhi praapt hui
 On his tour of India in March 1947, Liddell claimed that he had obtained approval from Nehru to hire a security lion officer of MI5 in New Delhi after the British Raj was abolished
 balachandran kehete hai, ''communiston kaa peechha karne kii ibi kii sanak 1975 tak jari rahi jab tak ki indira gandhi ne viraam nahin laga diya

 sarkaar ne netaji kii filon ko saarvajanik karne se inkaar nahin kiya hota to in tamaam kathaon par kab kaa viraam lag gaya hota

 All governments after Nehru have said the same thing to leaders, researchers and journalists that the contents of more than 150 files related to Netaji are so sensitive that exposing them can cause law and order problems, especially in West Bengal can it happen

 In the event of any disaster or emergency in the country, it has been proposed to provide a single number 2611 by connecting all the helplines
 is ek number main desh bhar kii sabhi helplinon ko jodne kaa prastaav he
 Dial 2611 as National Emergency Telephone Number System (NETNS) has been conceptualized by Dinkar Borde, a telecom engineer in Pune
 borde ne kaha ki is telephone number main sthaneey, kshetreey or rashtriya helplinon ko ekikrut karne kii baat he
 It is also easy to remember
 borde ne apana yah prastaav pichley saal aktubar main grih mantralay ke beuro of police research and dawalpment ke paas bheja tha
 Borde stated that NETNS has been designed in such a way that it will inform and coordinate the task forces in the event of an emergency
 yah puure desh ke liye ek hi number hoga
 Borde, a former technical advisor with the Government of India, stated that in his proposal he suggested that all existing emergency helpline numbers should be added to dial 2611
 unhone bataaya ki is number ko do kaarnon se chunaa gaya, pehla yah surakshit he or doosraa mumbai hamalon se judaa hone ke kaaran ise aasaani se yaad rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Borde said that the person who would call this helpline, where he is, would be informed on the basis of a central mechanism and the rescue teams would reach him within a few minutes
 telecom visheshgy ne bataaya ‘jab aap apatkaal se guzar rahe hote hai, to aapako is bare main bahut spasht bataanaa hoga he ki aap kahaan hai
 NETNS has a powerful telecom and info-tech system for this
 ’borde ke mutabik, ‘maine isamen artificial intelligence or bahubhasha tantra viksit kiya he, jisase sthaneey bhashaa main bhi pratikriya dene kii suvidha milegi
 'whenever someone calls 2611, after that the call will go to the national switchboard, from where the callers will be found
 iske baad ise switchboard najdiki public sefti ancering point (piesapi) tak jodta he, jahaan vishesh taur par prashikshit adhikari phone karne vaale ke liye sthaneey bachaav dal kii vyavastha karte hai
 Light Voice Commands can break into products
 Light Commands can send commands to be heard and not seen remotely
 If you are using popular voice assistance products from top technology companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, then this news is for you
 
 uniwarsity of electro-telecommunications, tokyo or uniwarsity of mishigan kii research team ne ek demonstrishan main dikhaaya ki “hamalavar dur se hi leisure lits kii madad se sunai or dikhaai naa dene vaali commands ko wais assistants main inject kar sakate hai
 These are voice assistance - Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Facebook portal and Apple Siri ”
 ‘lite commands’ ke code-nem vaali is takanic ke jariye ‘galat makasad vaali cmand ko wais controld divices’ jaise ki spikars, tablets or phone main inject kiya ja saktaa he
 The research team released a demonstration video earlier this week
 is video main dikhaaya gaya ki target tak commands ko badi duuri tak, yahaan tak ki lock kiye gaye kamaron main bhi shishe kii khidakiyon ke jariye bheja ja saktaa he
 (the Light Commands setup hacks the voice assistance system using a laser beam) The research team claims that 'taking advantage of a similar flaw in these popular devices, an attacker can send remote and unheard commands, Then these devices adopt that command on their own
 ’ek baar agar wais assistance systams main send lag jaati he to phir hamalavar isi khami kaa anya systams par hamalaa karne ke liye bhi istemaal karata he
 According to the research team, the attacker can also use this drawback to gain unofficial control over your "online purchases, smart home switches, smart garage doors, certain vehicles, smart locks"
 kaise karata he kaam?research team main takeshi sugavara, benjamin sir, sara rampajji, danniel jenkin or kevin phu shaamil hai
 Explaining the drawback in a research paper published by researchteam, it said that apart from audio, the microphones of these devices also react to the light that comes directly on them
 smart wais assistant aadhikarik yugers se interact karne ke liye upabhokta kii awaz par nirbhar karte hai
 In the 'light Commands' set-up, the flashing laser is used to access the microphones and the voice assist is effectively hijacked
 phir naa sunai dene vaali commands ko alexa, siri, portal or google divices par bheja jaataa he
 Based on this principle, the research team was successful in tricking the microphones to produce such an electric signal as if they were actually receiving audio
 iske liye electric signal ko lite beam kii tivrata ke mutabik modewllett kiya gaya
 How much does it cost? The set up uses products available in the open market such as telephoto lenses, laser drivers, telescopes or binoculars and other equipment
 shodhakartaaon ke anumaan ke mutabik ‘lite commands’ ke liye aavashyak sabhi upkarnon ko 600 dollar se bhi kam main hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 The basic drawback of devices such as voice assistance cannot be overcome until the microphones used in them are redesigned
 haalanki shodhakartaaon ne google, amejon, appal jaise popular nirmaataaon se is samasya ke sambhavit samaadhaan ke liye sampark kiya he

 While 75 percent of the tribals and 71 percent of the Dalits do not use social media, their number is 54 percent among the dominant castes
 soshal media platform par musalmaan mukharmusalmaan, jiskaa bada tabaka shaikshik or aarthik taur par dalit or adivasee samudaay se peeche bataaya jaataa he, wo soshal media par zyada mukhar he
 After the Upper Cast Hindu in India, it is the people of the minority community who are using social media most fiercely
 soshal media par mukhar hone ke maamle main alpsankhya samudaay ke log hindu obisi se bhi aage hai
 If we look at it personally, this pattern of Muslims becoming active after the upper cast is equally common on all social media platforms
 apper cast hindu ke baad muslim hi sabase zyada sabhi soshal media platform kaa yuj karata he
 Statistics show that people from upper castes are the most active on Facebook, whatsapp, youtube, Twitter and Instagram as compared to other communities
 yah pattern pichley paanch saal se lagaataar chalaa aa rahaa he
 At the same time, Muslims are in second place, followed by the turn of Dalits and Adivasis
 uttar pradesh or punjab ke vidhansabha chunaav ke liye congress kii prachaar ranneeti ko anjaam de rahe prashanth kishor yani pike ab uttarakhand main bhi sakriy ho chuke hai
 If sources are to be believed, Prashant Kishore will also be active in Uttarakhand in terms of electoral management and campaigning
 darasal congress ko ehsaas hua he ki harish ravat ne bhale hi kaam behatar kiya ho, lekin janata ke bich prachaar prasar paane main or naaron ko lokapriy banane main vah naakaamayaab rahe hai
 That is why Congress has now decided to use Rahul Gandhi's special strategist Prashant Kishore in UP and Punjab followed by Uttarakhand
 team pike kaa naaraa- 'baaki sab sapane hai, harish ravat apane hai'yah faisla hone ke turant badatim pikene ek naaraa diya- 'baaki sab sapane hai, harish ravat apane hai'
 
 
 On getting a fair response to this slogan, Congress general secretary and in-charge of Uttarakhand Ambika Soni has given a report to Nehru Gandhi
 unhone isamen kaha ki prashanth kishor or unki team agar uttarakhand main prachaar kii jimmedaari sanbhaalegi or congress party ke booth level ke workars or baaki netaaon, kaaryakartaaon ke saath milakar aage badhegi, to party ko phayda hoga he
 After this, Rahul also approved the proposal and Prashant Kishore became the poll manager of the Congress in UP and Punjab followed by Uttarakhand
 is babat jab ajtak ne ambika soni se baatcheet kii, to unhone kaha ki prashanth kishor pehle hi upi or punjab main congress kii team kii madad se prachaar prasar or management kaa jimmaa sambhaal rahe the
 He is a professional
 unhone khud uttarakhand main sahyog karne kaa prastaav rakhaa, to ham sab ne usko maan liya
 He said, 'now Prashant Kishore and the team will work together with the booth level workers of PK State Congress to create a strategy to create an atmosphere for the Congress party
 ummid karte hai ki iskaa hamako phayda hoga
 If sources are to be believed, the increased stature of Harish Rawat in Uttarakhand can benefit the Congress, but the way in which the matter has to be bounced among the people is to be taken advantage of by the policies of the Uttarakhand Congress Government
 Somewhere Harish Rawat's government was not able to succeed
 aise main ab congress party ne punjab or upi ke baad pike ko uttarakhand main bhi land kara diya he
 In the case of the shooting and killing of a grocery businessman in Samastipur district of Bihar, the police have solved the mystery of murder within 24 hours
 police ne kiraanaa vyavsaayee kii hatya ke aarope main 5 kukhyat aparaadhiyon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Three pistols, 5 cartridges, a Bolero, a Pulsar and 11 mobiles have been recovered from the arrested criminals along with the Swift Dzire car used in the murder
 giraftaar aparaadhiyon main chaar vaishali ke rahane vaale hai, jabaki ek apradhi madhubani kaa rahane vaala he
 In the interrogation of the police, the criminals have confessed that they murdered a grocery businessman while protesting during the robbery
 lutpaat ke dauraan kiraanaa vyavsaayee or aparaadhiyon ke bich kaaphi der hathapayee hui thi
 In the meantime, a bullet fired from the pistol hit the grocery businessman and a bullet to the criminal, who was arrested by the police in an injured state
 ghayal apradhi kaa ilaaj piemasiech patna main chal rahaa he
 How the incident happened Pankaj, a resident of Kothia under Bangra Thanam in Samastipur, was preparing to close his shop at around 11 pm on Friday that the criminals who were riding in Swift Desire first bought cigarettes, then robbed a bag full of serpents near Pankaj
 Wanted pankaj ne virodh kiya to aparaadhiyon ke saath unki hathapayee shuru ho gai
 During this scuffle, criminals opened fire with pistols
 ek goli jahaan vyavsaayee pankaj ko lagi, vahiin lutpaat karne vaale aparaadhiyon main se bhi ek goli lagane se ghayal ho gaya
 Taking advantage of the opportunity, the culprits escaped
 baad main goli kii aawaaj sunakar jute logon ne pankaj ko sadar aspataal main bhartee karaayaa, jahaan ilaaj ke dauraan uski maut ho gai
 However, during interrogation, Tausif also claimed that he had emailed several mps but none of the mps replied to his mail

 In western UP, the alliance between Samajwadi Party and RLD has not been agreed
 lekin congress ke bheetar bhi ajit singh kii party ke saath milakar chunaav ladane par ek raay nahin he
 How will Ajit win? Actually, one faction of Samajwadi Party and Congress believes that the political arithmetic of Western UP has changed after the Muzaffarnagar riots
 areldi kaa aadhaar votbank jat- muslim mana jaataa tha lekin areldi se gathjod ke virdohi kheme kii daleel he ki dangon ke baad jat or muslim kaa ek paale main aana mushkil he
 Will RLD harm BJP? BJP is eyeing large sections of Jat vote bank
 ajit singh ke paas thode jat votbank ke alaava kuch bachaa nahin he
 
 
 In such a situation, the RLD can only draw votes of the Jat community which will harm the BJP
 is baat kii ummid kam hi he ki areldi ko muslim tabaka vot degaa
 With the help of this arithmetic, a section of Congress leaders is not advocating for alliance with Ajit Singh's party after SP
 gathbandhan ke paksh main daleeldusri taraf, areldi se gathjod ke himachati congressi dhade kaa maananaa he ki bhale hi choudhary ajit singh kii party ko jat-muslim bikharaav kaa nuksaan uthaanaa pade lekin sapa- congress - areldi gathjod congress ke jat or baaki hindu ummidavaaron ko phayda pahunchayegaa
 Looking for the middle way, after listening to the two camps, the Congress high command decided that it would be better if the RLD is aligned with a few seats
 lekin ek seemaa se zyaada siten dene ko congress taiyaar nahin
 The screw is stuck for this reason
 philhal na ajit jhukna chaah rahe hai na hi congress
 Both are doing politics to increase pressure on each other
 pasopesh barkaraarek taraf areldi ke mahasachiv trilok tyaagi akele ladane kaa elaan kar chuke hai to duusari taraf congress ke prabharee mahasachiv gulam nabi azaad aadhikarik taur par abhi tak sirf congress or sapa ke gathbandhan kii baat karte aae hai
 He has on several occasions deferred the question of deliberately coming with RLD
 haalanki abhi bhi congress or areldi ke bich vatting game jari he
 The Congress hopes that either Ajit Singh or his son Jayant will accept the Congress' offer or will declare fighting alone

 Gilani said in this rally held on Friday that the annual Amarnath Yatra in South Kashmir should be reduced to 30 days for the safety of the devotees and the environment

 The incident on the highway is not taking the name of stopping
 gajiabad ke masuri thana chhetra main enech 24 se mahaj 200 meter andar musuri-bhudgadi ke raste par car savaar teen badmaashon ne car se ja rahe parivaar ke do bacchon ko gan point par lekar jevar or kareeb das hajaar rupee sahit mobile lootakar faraar ho gaye
 Angry relatives blocked the highway on this incident
 police is maamle main cese darj karke badmaashon kii talash main juty he
 The victim's family was traveling from Vegan r to Dadri to Meerut
 tabhi teen car savaar badmaashon ne hathiyaar ke bal bandhak bana liya or unhen aatankit kar unase jevaraat or rupee lut liye
 Even after calling, the police arrived in an hour
 isvaardator police kii laaparvaahee se gussaye parivaaravaalon ne enech 24 par jam laga diya
 As usual, the police was seen to be a granddaughter in the entire case
 police ke anusaar lut kii vaardaat ko anjaam dando ke bal par diya gaya he
 In such a situation, the question arises, what does the police want to prove by insisting on weapons, bypassing Kilutco
 vande maataram par vivaad main phir se ubaal he
 The new fledgling BJP government of Uttarakhand is going to make the recitation of Vande Mataram mandatory in the inter colleges of the state
 vande maataram ko lekar muslim samudaay kii apni aapatti rahi he
 That is, the new installment of the dispute on Vande Mataram has been fixed
 ragon main deshbhakti kaa jajba paidaa karne vaali in panktiyon (vande maataram) par phir se fasaad shuru ho chukaa he
 Some governments of the country are in favor of making the text of Vande Mataram mandatory
 magar muslim samudaay iskaa kadaa virodh kar rahaa he
 a new attempt has been made in Uttarakhand to make Vande Mataram necessary
 rajya sarkaar main ucch shikshaamantri dhan singh ravat kah rahe hai ki is maamle main sabhi samudaayon ne sahmati jataai he
 Let us tell you that Minister Dhan Singh Rawat had earlier said in an almost threatening tone in Roorkee Engineering College, 'if you have to live in Uttarakhand, you have to say Vande Mataram
 'unhone ye bayaan mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat or vidhansabha spikar kii maujuudagi main diya tha
 It is worth noting that before Uttarakhand, in many cities of UP, there has been a war on Vande Mataram
 alpsankhyak ade hai ki wo is geet ko nahin gaayenge, or satta main baithe kuch log amada hai kiwande maataramsabko gaanaa hoga
 The song Vande Mataram is Kufr for one, and the certificate of being patriotic for the other
 vande maataram par uthaa vivaad adaalat kii had tak bhi pahunchaa, lekin asli sawaal vande maataram ko deshbhakti se jodne or ghataane ko lekar he
 At present, the Uttarakhand government does not seem to be coming on the back foot with this decision
 dharne par baithe dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal par kabhi unki saathi raheen kiran bedi ne hamalaa bolaa he
 Bedi, who recently praised bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi, has said that the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi has become unbridled
 bedi ne dharne par baithe kejariwal par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki sadak chalane ke liye hoti he, dharne ke liye nahin
 Bedi said on the dharna of Kejriwal and his ministers, 'this does not happen
 sadakon par chalaa jaataa he
 Petroling happens on the roads
 'gauratlab he ki dilli police ke teen afasaron ko suspend karne kii maang kar rahe arvind kejariwal rail bhawan ke baahar hi dharne par baith gaye hai
 Bedi also made several tweets targeting Kejriwal
 unhone kaha ki aam aadmi party ke netaa tivi ke jariye lokapriyata hasil karne ke makasad se dharna-pradarshan par baithe hai
 Now the people of Delhi must have realized that their vote was rendered useless
 unhone kaha ki saarvajanik jivan main activism or gavarnence main antar hota he
 The government of Delhi is trying to avoid the accountability of governance
 AAP ke netaa apni giraftaar ke liye police se takaraav ke mood main hai
 Read below, some tweets of Bedi targeting Kejriwal and his government

 'the meeting condemned the use of force against farmers and it was resolved to fight for their rights
 nehru-gandhi parivaar main ek baar phir siyaasi talwaar tan gai he
 Priyanka reached Amethi to file her brother Rahul Gandhi's form, opened a front against cousin Varun Gandhi
 priyanka ne sultanpur kii janata se apil kii ki bijepi ke tikat par lard rahe varun gandhi ko sahi raste par laane ke liye wo unhen haraa den
 Rahul Gandhi is two years older than Priyanka in age while Varun is 8 years younger
 badalte raajnneetik or paariwarik halaat main varun kaa rasta rahul or priyanka se alag bhale rahaa, lekin nijee taur par parivaar ke masale par ye chup hi rahete hai
 In fact, Priyanka also showed the sweetness in the relationship many times, even among the political sour
 lekin chunaav kii garmi main rishte pighalane lage
 Talking to activists in Amethi said, 'blood and hate do not run in our veins, love and unity run
 agar galat raste par koi chal rahaa he to raajnneeti main kabhi-kabhi janata kaa vivek sahi rasta dikhaa detaa he
 In the meantime, when the political attack on the son was called, the mother came back again
 menka ne priyanka ko ulte samajhaayaa ki desh bhakthi or deshprem kya hota he, iske certificate kii jarurat nahin
 He said, 'to serve the country is to be lost, then the country will tell who has lost the way
 'bhai ke khilaaf priyanka kaa prachaagmethi-raibareli or sultanpur seat se nehru gandhi parivaar kaa bahut purana naata he
 It is also a coincidence that this time, one candidate each of these three seats is frozen in these three seats
 raibareli seat par congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi lard rahi hai to amethi seat par rahul gandhi jabaki sultanpur seat par bijepi ke mahasachiv varun gandhi
 Although the last time Varun Gandhi won from his mother Maneka Gandhi's traditional seat at Pilibhit, this time there is a domestic furore in the area surrounded by houses
 congress ne sultanpur seat se amethi rajgaraane ke sanjay singh kii patni amita singh ko maidan main utaara he
 See the helplessness of the election that a sister has to campaign against her brother
 wo bhi use sudhaarney ke naam par
 Congress's Sanjay Singh won the Sultanpur seat of Congress, which was united against Varun in eastern UP
 lekin tab sanjay singh kaa prachaar karne na sonia gayi, na rahul or priyanka
 On the other hand, Sanjay Singh never used to go to Rahul Gandhi's form admission
 party ek thi lekin rishton main ek alag kism kii khatas rahi lekin is baar sultanpur main varun ne chunaav ladakar inke rishte ko badal diya
 When Sanjay Singh was called in Rahul's nomination, Priyanka came to Sultanpur to ask for votes for Sanjay Singh's wife, that too against her own brother
 varun ne kii thi bhai rahul ke kaam kii tarifjis varun ko haraane kii baat priyanka ne kii, usee varun ne kuch dinon pehle amethi main kiye rahul ke vikaas kaary kii saraahna kar di thi
 The Congress, including Rahul, did not flourish with joy but the BJP received a loud blow
 tab varun kii taraf se unki maa menka gandhi ne morcha sambhala- sidhe rahul ke khilaaf
 a few days earlier, Maneka Gandhi had questioned Sonia's wealth
 unhone kaha tha ki vah dahej main ek paisa bhi saath nahin laai thim to aaj amir kaise ho gayi
 This quarrel is quite old, the roots of this quarrel are about three and a half decades deep
 sanjay gandhi kii akaal maut ke baad unki patni menka gandhi kaa rasta ek baar jo alag hua to phir rajeev or sanjay kaa parivaar phir se ek saath kabhi nahin hua
 Three years ago, when Varun Gandhi went to get married, he himself came to invite his Tai Sonia and elder siblings Rahul Priyanka
 tab laga tha ki us shaadi ke bahaane hi unke rishton kii girah shaayad khul jaae or tees saal se chali aa rahi khatas khatm ho jaae
 But this could not happen
 shaadi main naa sonia gayi, naa rahul or naa hi priyanka
 That knot of relationships is still tied, which is reflected from the tongue
 rishton main is kadavaahat kii beej to usee vakt pad gai thi, jab vimaan haadase main sanjay gandhi kii mrityu hui
 a few days later, Maneka Gandhi left the house of the then Prime Minister and her mother-in-law Indira Gandhi
 kaha jaataa he ki unhen pradhanmantri awaas se nikaal diya gaya
 After this, in the 1984 elections, Maneka Gandhi took a front against her brother Rajiv Gandhi in Amethi, but could not save her bail
 rishton par padi barf tab pighalati dikhi, jab 1997 main priyanka gandhi kii shaadi main varun bhi aae
 The presence of younger brother was enough to tell that everything is going well in the family
 haalanki tab bhi menka nahin pahunchi thi
 Meanwhile, Varun Gandhi also joined the BJP
 maa menka to pehle se hi thim
 The battle of the bus family started turning into a party war

 The Shivraj Singh Chauhan government started the 'deendayal Rasoi Yojana' with great fanfare in April this year
 pandit deen dayaal upaadhyaay ke janmashti samarohon ke tahat shuru kii gai is yojana main garibon ko 5 rupye main bhojan uplabdh karaane kii baat kahi gai thi
 According to the ideals of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay, the goal of this scheme was to bring relief to the person standing on the last rung in the society
 lekin ab kareeb 8 maheene baad is yojana kii jamini hakeekat bhi jaan lijie
 Shivraj Sarkar has not released a single penny for this scheme yet
 aisi sthiti main jinhen is yojana ko chalaane kii jimmedaari saunpi gai thi wo ab haath peeche khinchne kii baat karne lage hai
 Let us first consider the statement made by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan at the inauguration of 'deendayal Rasoi Yojana' on 7 April 2017 in Gwalior
 mukhyamantri ne kaha tha, “ek vichaar mere man main aayaa
 i thought of poor people
 wo jo majdoor hai, purush or mahilaayein jo gujaarey ke liye haadtod mehnat karte hai
 Those who come to the cities in search of livelihood
 maine sochaa ki unhen bhookha nahin rahanaa chahie
 With this idea, 'deendayal Rasoi Yojana' was born
 garibon ke maseehaa deen dayaal upaadhyaay ke naam par yojana jisamen garib logon ko maatr 5 rupye main paushtik or swaadisht khaanaa uplabdh karaayaa jaae
 My dream is that nobody should be hungry
 ”mukhyamantri chouhan ne is yojana ko pandit deen dayaal upaadhyaay ke janmashti varsh main unhen yaad karne kaa sabase acha tarika bhi bataaya tha
 Shocking facts came to light when 'aaj Tak / India Today' did a reality check of Deendayal Rasoi Yojana launched in Madhya Pradesh on the lines of 'amma Canteen' of Tamil Nadu late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa
 mukhyamantri chouhan ke grih jile sihor mendinadayal rasoi yojanachalane kii jimmedaari pradeep sharma par he
 Since April 7 this year, Sharma has been providing food to 500 people at the rate of Rs 5 per person every day
 unhen gehun or chaaval ek rupye prati kilo ke hisaab se miltaa he
 But Sharma claims that he has spent Rs 8 lakh out of his pocket since the scheme started in April
 yojana kii shuruyaat ke vakt sarkaar ne vaada kiya tha ki hone vaale kharch or 5 rupye prati vyakti ke hisaab se praapt hone vaali rakam main jo bhi antar hoga, uski bharpai sarkaar kii ore se kii jaaegi
 Sharma claims that he has not received even a single penny from the government
 sharma ke mutabik wo is silsile main kai baar sarkaar se guzarish kar chuke hai lekin koi jawaab nahin mila
 Sharma also said that in such a situation he would have to close the 'deendayal Rasoi'
 dinadayal rasoi main yojana ke jo binar tange hai unamem mukhyamantri chouhan kii tasviir pramukhataa se najar aati he
 What has been written about the scheme on the walls and the token book, clearly states that it is a government scheme
 jo log rasoi main khaanaa khaane aate hai, unhen ye dekhakar yahi lagata he ki sasta khaanaa muhaiyaa karaane ke liye sarkaar madad detii he
 a person eating food in the kitchen said, "this is a government scheme and it will be very sad if it closes
 ”sihor ke chif municipal officer sudhir kumaar singh kaa is prakaran par kahana he, “ye sarkari yojana nahin he
 It was to be run with the help of donors
 sihor main daan dene vaale nahin mil rahe hai
 We are trying our best to find donors on our behalf
 ”sihor akelaa jila nahin he jahaan dinadayal rasoi yojana dam todatii najar aa rahi he
 Prakash Smriti Sewa Sansthan is running Deendayal Rasoi in Khargone
 is santhaan ke manager vikram singh chouhan kaa kahana he, “yojana shuru hone ke baad se ab tak ham aath lakh rupye kharch chuke hai lekin badale main kuch bhi waapas nahin mila
 We cannot run it for long
 agar hamaara paisa jari nahin kiya gaya to ham march main ise band kar denge
 "similar plight of Deendayal Rasoi Yojana was also seen in Morena, Bhind and Alirajpur districts
 muraina main rasoi chalaane vaale maa vaishno devi bhandar trust ke manager ghanashyam botham ne kaha, “yojana april main shuru kii gai to kuch daankarta saamne aae
 But now nobody is giving anything, everything has to be spent from one's own pocket
 aise hi chalata rahaa to rasoi ko bahut jaldi band karnaa padegaa
 Laxman Rajawat, manager of the entire development service committee that runs the kitchen in Bhind, expressed the same agony
 alirajpur main dinadayal rasoi ke manager santosh tehpadia ne kaha ki garibon ke liye ye badi acchhee yojana he, lekin sarkaar ke fund relies nahin karne kii vajah se ye lanbaa nahin chal paaegi
 Opposition party Congress has also got a chance to target the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government on the plight of Deendayal Rasoi Yojana
 madhya pradesh vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa ajay singh ne kaha, “ye sab vaaki bahut dukhad he
 He talks about Deendayal Upadhyay and the last person standing in the queue
 or yojana kaa naam dinadayal rasoi rakhaa jaataa he
 
 
 And now the scheme is on the verge of closure due to lack of funds
 jis tarah yojana ko chalaaya ja rahaa he wo sarkaar ke chehre par dhabba he
 "urban Development Minister Maya Singh said that the government had never promised to give money for the scheme, the scheme was to be run with the help of donations
 mantri ne ye bhi daawa kiya ki unhen is baat kii jaankaree nahin he ki kai jilon main rasoi ko chalaane vaali sansthaaon inhen band karne kii baat kah rahe hai
 The minister does not know this, but just below the government's nose, Abhijit Asthana, manager of Ghanshyam Seva Samiti, which runs Deendayal Rasoi in Bhopal, said, "we have written a letter to the Municipal Corporation
" saath hi 30 november kii dedline rakhi he
 If we have not received the money by this date, we will close the kitchen
 ab dekhnaa he ki dinadayal rasoi yojana kii shuruyaat ke vakt prachaar se apane liye khub vaahvahee batorne vaali shivaraj sarkaar kab jaagti he? kab aakhri saansen le rahi is yojana kii sud leti he jiske jariye kisi ko bhookha nahin sone dene kaa daawa kiya gaya tha

 Friedman's world-famous masterpiece 'the World I'
 ja flats' kaa yah hindi anuwaad ikkisvin sadi kii vaishvikrut duniyaan kaa ek jeevant vivaran he, jisamen badalati vaishvik vyavastha kaa chithran he
 To understand this book, one has to go back a little in history, when Soviet Russia was shattered in the typhoon of market forces
 us vakt ke yug purush mikhail gorvachev shaayad duniya main satta ke santulan ko badalane vaale sabase bade kirdaar the
 The truth at that time was believed to be that the world has become a polar and that the only pole was America
 america ke vaishvik ekadhikaar or prabhutv par koi prashnchikk nahin laga saktaa tha
 All this also lasted for two decades
 lekin ab itihaas main aglaa panna palatakar saamne aa rahaa he
 This book is the description of the same front page
 duniya ab samtal he or samtal duniya main kai nae or prabhavi khilaadi america aarthik prabhutv ko chunauti de rahe hai
 Mainly two Asian superpowers India and China
 shaayad isi chunauti ke alok main fredman america ko swayan ko punarsthapit karne ke liye prerit karnaa chaah rahe hai or suzav bhi de rahe hai ki america ko apni jeevanstyli main kaise badlaav laane honge
 The worldwide recession and economic crisis of 2008 presented two different views
 ek taraf isane jahaan america netritv vaale khule bazaar or vaishvikaran par aadhaarit poonjeevaad kii pashchimi avadharana par sawalia nishaan khadaa kiya vahiin duusari ore china or bharat ke rup main duniya ko aisi aarthik takaton kaa udhaaharan prastut kiya jo vishwavyaapee mandi ke prabhaav se lagbhag achoote rahe
 This recession only confirmed the concept that the world is rapidly leveling
 or is samtal duniya kaa ek nayaa lekin prabhaavshaalee khilaadi bharat hoga
 The author's statement that "I had come to Columbus in Silicon Valley, Bangalore, India" is a thrill
 yah thik hi he ki jab columbus bharat kii khoj main aayaa tha to use jis sampada kii talash thi vah dhaatu, resham or samale jaisi chijen thim, jise lekhak ne hardware mana he
 In those days he used to get rich from these things
 lekin ikkisvin sadi ke dhanarjan ke strot hai software, computer program, kollcenter ityadi
 The basic issues raised in the book relate to the power of the same software
 aakhir kya vajah he ki america or anya audyogic deshon main soochna hnaudyogiki or sevaaon ke outsorcing ke liye bharat mahatvapurn ho gaya he? lekhak ke us kathan kii badi sarthakata he ki columbus bharat ke bhram main america pahunch gaya or usne sochaa ki vah bharat kaa hi ek hissaa he
 But the writer really came to India and found it similar to America
 is pustak main bharat kii software udyog kii kshamta or sambhaavnaaon kii kaaphi sargarbhit vyakhya kii gai he
 It is true that today India is a world-class player due to the capability of its software industry and America is also feared by it
 yahi gyaan yug kii dein he
 Even if the American philosopher Benjamin Franklin said that knowledge is power
 aaj ise sabit to bharat ne hi kiya
 And this knowledge power made the world flat
 lekhak ne vaishvikaran ko teen yugon main baanta he
 The first phase was from 1492 to 1800, when Columbus, through his travels, opened the way for mutual trade between the new and old worlds
 doosraa daur lekhak ne 1800 se 2000 tak ko mana he, jisamen duniya ko ekikrut karne vaali shaktiyaan mukhya rup se bahurashtriya companiyaan raheen
 The third phase of globalization is the current era, in which software and digital technology has made many new players globally influential
 lekhak ne america ke liye kai yuktiyaan bataai hai taaki uskaa vaishvik pratispardhaa main tike rahanaa sambhav ho sake
 Talking primarily about emphasizing action and imagination, the author has once again instructed America to change its thinking and accept the fact that the world is no longer round
 rochak or behad tathyaparak pustak
 An eye-sighted tale of today's era
 par iske kritrim anuwaad ne puri kitaab kaa majaa kirkira karke rakh diya he

 In exclusive talks with Aaj Tak, Hamid Karzai, who has visited India, said that the talk of repression of the Pakistan Army in Balochistan constantly comes to light and that the policy of Pakistan has to bear the brunt of the people of the neighborhood and other areas
 'PAK aatank kaa sef heaven'aatankwaad ke maamle par pakistan ko nishane par lete hue hamid karaji ne kaha ki pakistan aatankiyon ke liye sef hewan bana hua he
 Hamid Karzai also said that terrorism is constantly being promoted by Pakistan, which is a threat to the peace of the entire region
 ye kisi ke bhi haq main nahin he
 Terrorism is not in anyone's favor and Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and everyone should find a solution to the issues with peace

 desh main jab kisi ko faansee kii sajaa di jaati he to us vakt vahaan doctor kaa rahanaa bhi jaruri hota he, lekin ab desh main doctoron kii sanstha indian medical association (IMA) ne medical council of india (MCI) ko chitthee likhakar is par aitraaj jataayaa he
 In the letter, forcing a doctor to be present at the time of hanging is stated to be against medical principles

 K
 ke agarwal ne MCI adhyaksh ke naam bheji chitthee main kaha he ki kisi doshi ko faansee die jate vakt doctor kii maujuudagi medical siddhanton kaa ulanghan he or ek taraf se peshewar taur par galat aacharan he
 At the time of hanging, the doctor has to monitor how the vital signs of the body of the person to be punished are working
 faansee die jane ke baad mrityu kii ghoshnaa bhi doctor dwaara hi kii jaati he
 The presence of doctors at the time of official hanging is a very controversial issue in view of medical principles
 medical siddhant kehete hai- 'nuksaan naa karo' or 'acha karo'
 The presence of a doctor at the time of hanging is against both these things
 IMA kii chitthee main hawala diya gaya he ki world medical association (WMA) ne pehle 1981 main ek prastaav paas karke is mudde par virodh jataayaa tha
 This issue was raised again in 2008 through amendments

 Agrawal told India Today that the revised Geneva Declaration of WMA 'the Physician Pledge' was adopted on 14 October 2017 in the WMA General Assembly
 is prastaav ke mutabikphysician (doctor)ko maut kii sajaa se judi kisi bhi prakiya ke vakt kisi bhi tareeke se upasthit rahanaa aniatik he
 In the proposal, all doctors have been asked to run a campaign in front of their governments or legislatures to end this obligation
 IMA ke WMA ke sadsy hone kii vajah se uske prastaavon ko maananaa jaruri he
 Dr
 agarwal ke mutabik IMA kaa bhi yahi mat he ki faansee dete vakt koi doctor upasthit nahin rahanaa chahie
 Dr
 agarwal ne kaha ki is vishay main MCI se sheeghra kadam uthaane ke liye aagrah kiya gaya he
 If this does not happen, the IMA will pass a resolution on the subject in its meeting in December
 IMA main 3 lakh doctor sadsy hai
 It has 1700 local branches and 31 state branches

 puri duniya ko intazaar he saal 2018 kii sabase badi raajnneetik ghatana kaa
 When US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Marshal Kim Jong Un meet in May
 magar is mulaakaat se pehle kaa ek sach jaan lijie
 For the last seven years, Kim Jong Un has been in power in North Korea
 lekin in saat saalon main wo kabhi kisi desh ke rashtradhyaksh se nahin mila
 He has not been out of North Korea even once in the last 17 years, that is, he has been imprisoned in his own country for 17 years
 uttar korea se baahar nahin jaataa kimtanashaah kim jong un pichley 17 varshon se kabhi uttar korea se baahar nahin niklaa
 He has not met any head of state for the last seven years
 wo kabhi sanyukt raashtra main bolne nahin gaya
 Nobody ever saw him at the Global Summit
 korea kaa rashtradhyaksh hote hue usne kabhi koi videsh yatra nahin kii
 Kim is afraid of moving to another country, he is afraid to get out of his country
 use duusare desh jate hue dar lagata he
 Do you know why? Because his heir is still very young
 or jab tak wo gaddi sanbhaalane laayak nahin ho jaataa, wo apni jaan kaa risk nahin lenaa chahta
 With the reality of North Korean dictator Marshall Kim Jong being exposed, it is feared that he will not even go out of the country to meet Donald Trump in May? Very few people study in Switzerland school You might know that Kim Jong Un, who is imprisoned in his own country, has done his schooling from Switzerland
 switzraland kii rajdhani bern ke nazadik ek international skool main kim jong un ne naam or pahchaan badalakar padhai kii
 According to school records, from 1993 to 98, he used to study in the school under the name Chola Pak
 sharmile mizaaj or basketbaal ke shaukeen kim jong un kii suraksha ke liye senior student ke bhesh main har vakt uske bodyguard uske aasapaas hote the
 It is believed that Kim Jong Un lived in Switzerland until 2001 and then returned to Korea to complete further studies with Kim Il Sang University
 yani kareeb 17 saalon se kim korea main hi or phir kabhi desh ke baahar nahin gaya
 Nobody knows Kim's birthplace, Kim Jong Un's father Kim Jong Il always kept his son hidden from the world
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki kisi ko kim ke janm kii sahi taarikh nahin pataa
 It is believed that he was born on 8 January
 magar 1982 main hua
 Nobody knows whether it happened in 83 or 84
 duniya ke saamne kim jong il apane is bete ko pehali baar tab laae jab apni beemaari ke kaaran kim ko taiyaar karne kii niyas se unhone use cabinet main pehali aadhikarik post di
 China and Russia are friends, yet did not visit
 North Korea's command Kim Jong Un has been in the hands of India since 2011
 or satta par kaabiz hone ke baad se hi ye ghaatak hathiyaaron kii apni sanak ko puraa karne ke liye aisa laga ki phir isane kisi desh yaa kisi pratibandh kii parvaah hi nahin kii
 Meanwhile, neither did it meet the head of state of any other country nor did it meet any head of state
 china or rus ko north korea kaa dost bataaya jaataa rahaa he, magar in deshon kii bhi kim jong un ne kabhi yatra nahin kii
 In 2015, China also invited Kim, but he refused to go there
 train se rus jate the kim ke pitamai 2015 main kim jong kaa rus jane kaa bhi ek kaarykram bana tha
 But he was later canceled by a Russian government spokesman, saying that Kim did not want to come out of his country
 bataaya jaataa he ki kim jong un ke pita kim jong il rus or china ke daure par jate the, lekin wo bhi flite kii bajaae train kii sawari karte the
 In media reports, apart from security reasons, it has always been speculated that Kim Jong-un does not want another leader to take a major decision in North Korea in his absence
 26 deshon se rajanyik sambandhuttar korea ke duniya main 26 deshon se rajanyik sambandh hai, jisamen bharat bhi shaamil he
 However, no ruler of North Korea has come to India till date
 alam ye he ki kim jong un duusare deshon ke sarvocch netaaon se baat karnaa bhi pasand nahin karata
 Many times the leaders of other countries did not succeed when they tried to talk to Kim
 winter olympic ke dauraan bhi dakshin korea se baatcheet ke liye usne apni bahan ko hi aage kar diya tha
