 aadhaar ke sahare is yojana ko lagu kiya jayega
 The government estimates that by implementing both these steps, it will save Rs 5000 crore annually

 motorola, jo ab chini company lenovo kii ek sahaayak company ban chuki he Moto z ke baad ek nayaa smartphone laane ja rahi he
 Moto M, the photos and details of this smartphone have been leaked and it can also be launched on 9 November
 ise dekhakar aisa lagata he ki yah lenovo kaa koi smartphone he
 However, after the acquisition of Motorola, its president, Rick Aussie, was clear from the time he left the company that what Motorola is now known for will not be the case
 ah rik google ke hardware divijan ke head hai or iskaa parinaam or google Pixel se andaja laga sakate hai
 Now talking about adulterated Android instead of pure, then next Motorola's next smartphone Moto M

 This will be Motorola's first smartphone in which Lenovo's interface will be used instead of pure Android
 isse pehle tak company apane smartphone main pyor android detii thi jo isaki khaasiyat thi
 Stock or Pure Android means that there is no adulteration
 lekin ab isamen milawat dekhne ko milegi
 It will have the user interface of Motorola and Lenovo, there will be some apps that you will never be able to remove, there will be some features that will slow down the smartphone and there will be some features that will cause you a lot of trouble
 philhal metal body smartphone kaa trend he isamen bhi vaisaa hi he
 Fingerprint scanner is provided in the rear
 peeche se dekhakar aap ise lenovo main shaomi kaa smartphone samaj sakate hai
 Metal design, which can be called Xiaomi or Lenovo, this time the company has decided to say goodbye to its signature style
 is baar phul metal body hogi jiske peeche motorola kaa signechar m logo vaala dimple bhi nahin hoga
 Now the company will provide fur fingerprint scanner here and below it will be the Motorola logo
 agar aap motorola smartfones ke phens hai to aap isaki licd photo dekhakar ye andaja laga sakate hai, kaise dhire dhire ab motorola lenevo banati ja rahi he
 According to hardware specification reports, it will be a mid-range smartphone, but the specifications given in it will be right
 licd spacification ke mutabik Moto m main Helio P15 octacor procesar ke saath 4GB ram or 32GB kii internal memory di jaaegi
 It has 5 as a display
 5 inch kii phul echdi screen hogi or photography ke liye isame 13 megapixl rier camera hoga
 It is reported to have an 8 megapixel front camera for selfie
 isaki bydaree 3,050mah kii hogi
 It is being guessed from the leaked image that it will have its own user interface UI of Android Marshmallow based company
 connactivity ke liye is baar micro yuasabi conector kii jagah USB Type c yuj kiya jayega
 It will be interesting to see how the company will lure users with the first smartphone without stock Android
 kyonki maujuuda daur main jinhen stock android yuj karnaa hota he wo yaa to motorola ke smartphone lete hai yaa google nexs yaa picksal

 com / hwbkp1a5sm Sourav Ganguly, one of the most successful captains of Indian cricket and new rising star Ravichandran Ashwin are talking about what it takes to reach the pinnacle of the game
 aswin yaad karte hai ki kaise unhone bataur ballebaaj shuruyaat kii thi, phir madhyam gati ke gendbaaj bane or aakhirkaar of spin par aa gaye, jisamen ve behad kaamyaab ho rahe hai
 He also reminds Ganguly how big he was when he saw him playing Ganguly: You got a chance to see your records? Ravichandran Ashwin: Yes, i have seen and i know you keep an eye on the records
 ek vakt main un bacchon main tha jo aapako khelte dekha karte the or bhartiya cricket team ke khilne ke tareeke se prerit hote the
 It is thrilling to be on a stage with you now
 soravayaap kya pasand karte hai, ballebaaji yaa gendbaaji?asvinanijee taur par gendbaaji
 But i also like batting
 shuruyaat main main salaami ballebaaj tha
 Off-spin bowler i became the latter, after bowling medium fast
 soravayaapaki lambaai tej gendbaaj hone ke liye mufeed he par aap spinner ban gaye
 i have also done some medium pace bowling and when i used to get a wicket, i was as happy as making a half century in the Test
 meri ballebaaji acchhee thi, gendbaaji nahin
 But you are good at both
 maine aapkaa khel dekha he, khaskar batting
 You have played some good innings, against England and also against New Zealand
 aapaki ballebaaji main kya khaas baat he?asvinamaine jab se pratham shrenee cricket khelnaa shuru kiya, meri gendbaaji ne meri ballebaaji kii bahut madad kii, khel ke charnon ko samajhane ke lihaaj se
 In my first-class career, i quickly became a captain and began to understand the ups and downs of the game, which i use in my batting, especially when i come in the middle order
 asvinaapake shatakon se zyada, aapaki kai tejatarraar paariyaan mere dimag main hai
 Can you tell us about the natwest Series (2002) in which you blew away the bowlers? Sourav: Actually i was not able to score runs in that series
 ek half centuri lagaai or phir baahar kar diya gaya tha
 In fact, i had a brief conversation with John Wright and the next day i went to do a meeting
 ham 325 ran ke lakshya kaa peechha kar rahe the or main rakshaatmak nahin ho saktaa tha
 i had to give a good start to the Indian team
 sahvaag or main ballebaaji karne gaye or yah ve din the jab aap gend ko achche-se maaro to vah sidhe udati hui stand main chali jaati thi
 He was a fantastic lakhaha and i keep watching it on TV when i took off my shirt
 aisa bhi nahin tha ki meraa sharir viraat kohli kii tarah he jis par kats or tatu bane hon
 This is a different generation
 asvinayaap logon ne jo kiya, vah ek kism kaa kayapalat tha
 We are taking it forward
 mujhe yaad he jab aapane chequipayans trophy (2000) main jahir khan kii gend par adam gilcrist kaa kaich pakadaa tha
 Saurav: He was an easy catch, i showed him that he looked a bit difficult
 asvinabaat yah nahin ki vah kaich kitna mushkil tha
 It is about the message he gave to the next generation
 main paanch yaa chah saal kii umr se test cricket dekh rahaa hum
 i used to listen to commentary on radio and in those days India could hardly win a match
 sauravohamen apni padhai ke bare main kuch bataaie
 Ashwin: i did well in school and completed engineering from Anna University
 apane aasapaas pratibhashali khiladinnon ko dekhnaa kaisaa lagata tha, or khaskar us vakt jab ve kabhi-kabhi acha pradarshan nahin kar pate the?sauravakkuch der ke liye aap pareshaan ho jate hai or phir aapako ehsaas hota he ki aakhir ve bhi insaan hai, unase bhi galtiyaan ho sakati hai
 i was upset that we had to chase 325 runs in the natwest final
 ballebaaji ke liye ground main jate vakt virendra sahvaag mere peeche aa rahe the
 They were humming a Hindi song
 maine unase poocha, yah kya ho rahaa he? unhone kaha ki ham yah match jeetenge
 Sachin, Azhar and Rahul have similar experiences
 asvinain logon kaa maargdarshan karnaa kaisaa anubhav tha? 325 ran jaise score kaa peechha karnaa un dinon badi baat thi
 i remember the previous best score of Indian team was 315 runs in Dhaka (1998)
 us match kii aapaki kya yaaden hai?sauravamatch ke dauraan andhera ho gaya
 Stadium lights were not as they are now
 vah multiprapaj stadium tha or vahaan footbal bhi khelaa jaataa tha
 Later in that match, Pakistani players could not know where the ball was going
 un dinon agar donon captain raji hon to liten jala di jaati thim
 Sachin played well in that match as well
 un jaise khilaadi ke saath khilne main acchhee baat yah thi ki ve aapkaa sara dabaav apane upar le lete hai
 In the current Indian team, Virat Kohli does the same
 sauravangkis gendbaaj se aap prerana lete hai?asvinashen warn se
 Saurav: In media it is said that Ashwin is Chennai's most humble cricketer
 pehle ke
 Srikanth, Dinesh Karthik and Sadgopan Ramesh
 ravichandran aswin chennai kii alag tarah kii paudh hai
 Is that right? Ashwin: i think you are 40 percent the same as you are raised, 40 percent is your training and 20 percent is how you use them
 meri maa tamilnadu ke ek gaanv se hai or mere liye badi prerana rahi hai
 She came to Chennai, studied here and started working with a corporate company
 aapke liye left arm spin yaa kisi bhi kism kii spin ko khelnaa itnaa zyada aasaan kyon tha?sauravatej gendbaaji par main zyada ran nahin bana sakaa
 i had to take advantage of left arm spin
 main aapke jitna bhaagyashaalee nahin hum
 Ashwin: With 141 runs scored in Adelaide (against Pakistan in 2000), it does not seem so
 aapane wasim akram ko itani aasaani se khelaa
 Saurav: i had to retain my place in the team as well
 asvinasrilanka main jeetna aasaan nahin hota
 Saurav: Remember, we went there when there were no neutral umpires
 arvind disilva ko out karnaa bure sapane kii tarah hota tha
 He annoyed even Abhay Kuruvilla, who was polite like you, so you can imagine how many times desilva had to be dismissed
 srilanka kii baat chal rahi he, to gaale (2015) main aap log pehla match haar gaye the, phir unhen 2-1 se haraaya
 How was this return? Ashwin: There is a lot of honesty in this team
 jab ham gaale kaa match haar gaye to sabhi behad dukhi the
 We were talking about it, so i said why don't we play the way we play on the nets? Cheteshwar Pujara had not played a single Test match for a year and was hungry for runs
 phir unhen saikadaa lagaate hue ham dekh sakate the
 Sourav: Apart from Kohli, you are the most valuable person in this team
 india today ne mujhase poocha ki team main sabase keemtee khilaadi koun he? maine kaha ki main viraat ko aadha fisadi zyada duungaa
 Where will Indian cricket go from here? Ashwin: We can win by going overseas too
 ham har maamle main puri takat laga rahe hai
 The first thing for me was fitness
 tej gendbaajon ke maamle main bhi hamane use sambhaal liya he
 Now the thing is for the fast bowlers to maintain their consistency
 bijepi ne police ke nirdesh ke maddenjar pichley dinon vivadaspad bayaan dene vaali kendriya mantri sadhvi niranjan jyoti kii aaj hone vaali nukkad sabha kaa sthaan badal diya he
 Sadhvi was scheduled to address the Nukkad Sabha in Block-36 of Trilokpuri in East Delhi this evening, but her meeting will now take place in Block-34
 kuch dinon pehle hi trilokapuri main sampradayik hinsa bhadki thi or isaki jad main block-36 bhi aayaa tha
 Police had told BJP this morning to look for another venue for the meeting
 bhaajapa ke ek pravaktaa ne bataaya, 'hamane sadhvi niranjan jyoti kii nukkad sabha ke sthaan ko badal diya he
 We have made a slight change in the location keeping in view the law and order situation
 nayaa sthaan block-34 he

 He did not watch television, did not spend time outside the house having fun with friends, studied for four hours every day and scored 95 per cent in the 12th class CBSE (central Board of Secondary Examination) examination
 kolkata main rahane vaali anoushka ko ummid thi ki uske shandaar ankon kii vajah se use dilli vishvavidhyalay ke top collejon main se kisi ek main daakhila mil jayega
 But when Sri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) released its first cut-off list and 96

 Union Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal termed the impossible cutoff lists as absurd, and Vineet Joshi, president of the CBSE, the premier national examination institution, admitted that the 12th marks were not the appropriate criterion to be selected for higher education

 And during the same period, the number of students scoring more than 95 per cent increased from 1,202 to 2,097, which is even more surprising

 ek mantralay ke adhikari kaa kahana he ki kuch board apane chaatro ko rajnatik dabaav ke kaaran yaa college main daakhila dilaane ke liye jaan-bujhkar zyada ank dete hai
 According to him, students do not necessarily become so meritorious that they are scoring so many marks
 haa, ve yah samajha gaye hai ki kis jawaab yaa mahatvapurn shabd (yaa kii verde) ke kaaran unhen achche ank milenge
 Shyam Menon, vice-chancellor of Ambedkar University in New Delhi, says, "now people are starting to question 100% marks
 hamen pehle hi chaukanna ho janaa chahie tha

 But an elite education system like the University of Delhi, in which everyone (with 54,000 seats) vies for admission to 10 of 84 major colleges, maintains a select system of India in which centers of excellence, model schools and innovative experiments The centers are few
 kuch visheshgy pariksha paddati ko doshi tehraate hai ki vah chaatro ko aisi vyavastha ke anukool khud ko dhaalane ke liye majaboor karti he, jo spasht rup se doshapurn he
 Under this system, meeting the only standard of higher education (12th standard examination) creates a do or die situation for the students

 CBSE has started giving grades by continuous and comprehensive assessment instead of board examination in class 10th
 lekin 12veen kii pariksha main ab bhi ank die ja rahe hai
 In a way, teachers have also given up their responsibility of assessment due to public examination, due to which the trust between the teacher and the student is reduced
 yahaan tak ki maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay bhi apni vyavastha durust nahin kar paa rahaa he
 The reforms have come to a halt after the passage of the Right to Education program and the introduction of grading system in place of the CBSE examination of 10th standard
 videshi shaikshik sanstha vidheyak, technical evam medical institution main anuchit tareekon ko rokane ke liye vidheyak, innovative vishvavidhyalay vidheyak jaise shiksha se jude mahatvapurn vidheyak latake hue hai

 Sadly, in today's school education system, students are told not to learn but to collect marks

 In this new style, instead of repeating and rote content, emphasis is placed on synthesis, analysis, argumentation, understanding, application and assessment

 Former NCERT Director A

 Sharma says, "CBSE reforms focused only on testing knowledge
 usamen 1986 kii rashtriya shiksha niti ke tahat tay uddeshy ko lagu karne par dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 The objective of that policy is to inculcate research, creativity, objectivity, enthusiasm to ask questions, and aesthetics in students
 ''chaatr adhik ank hasil karne ke liye 10veen ke baad sibiesai chhodkar rajya board ke skulon main daakhila le rahe hai
 But this change is not true in the case of West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education (WBCHSE), which does not give open marks
 kolkata ke prasiddh south point haai skool ne rajya board ke saath hi sibiesai bhi lagu kar diya he
 Principal Roopa Sanyal Bhattacharya says the state boards aim to be as close as possible to the CBSE
 chaahe vah grading ho yaa ank, yaa aptitude test yaa board akzam, dekha sirf yahi jaataa he ki chaatr ne kitne ank hasil kiye
 The cutoff marks kept increasing with time, but how and why are the students getting such marks? The English teacher of class VII in a government school in Delhi says, "it is possible to get 100% marks in English also under the current poor marking scheme

 In this, only a word is given to refer to it, even if the grammar, spelling and expression in it are wrong
 sawaal ke saath die gaye uddhran main hi uttar hota he
 Long questions are divided into several sections, which makes it easier to collect marks
 12veen class kii ek anya teacher kaa kahana he ki bhale hi ve chaatro ke asli gyaan ko parakhane ke liye kuch uttar pustikaon ko sakhti se jaanchen par pramukh pareekshak ank praayah badha dete hai

 Changes in the education system range from preparing similar entrance exams like the US 'SAT', which is the standard of higher education qualification, to raising the quality of educational institutions, raising funds for research as well as better facilities in private universities, courses
 Efforts will have to be made to nationalize and standardize examinations that focus on regular assessment of students

 According to TMC sources, the party does not agree with Stalin's stand
 trinmul congress (tiemasi) ke ek netaa ne kaha ki puure vipaksh kaa maananaa he ki piem pad ke liye kisi bhi naam kaa aage badhanaa swaagatyogy nahin he
 We have said earlier that the Prime Minister's name will be decided only after the election results
 is kadam kaa asar bijepi ke khilaaf vipakshi dalon ko ekajute hone main pad saktaa he
 TMC said that the Congress is not even furthering the name of any leader, so why are other parties taking such steps
 tiemasi ke alaava anya kai vipakshi dalon ke kai netaa bhi 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main vipakshi gathbandhan kii ore se kisi kaa naam pradhanmantri pad ke liye pesh kiye jane ke khilaaf hai
 Sources in the opposition camp gave this information
 vipaksh ke ek varisht netaa ne bataaya, "vipaksh ke kai netaa pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee ke rup main kisi kaa naam ghoshit kiye jane ke khilaaf hai
 The SP, TDP, BSP, Trinamool and NCP do not agree with Stalin's announcement
 yah jaldibaji he
 The Prime Minister will decide only after the Lok Sabha results
 " BJP MP from north west dilli se bijepi saansad udit raaj vivaadon main ghir gaye hai, aarope he ki rehadi-patari lagane waalon se sanghathan banane ke naam par ₹200 liye gaye or badale main kaha gaya he ki unhen koi pareshaan nahin karegaa
 On the matter, Udit Raj says that the BJP has a different color, the Congress is different, the Army is different, in this way we have given a different color to the street vendors
 unhen billaa or topi di gai he
 In return for which two hundred rupees have been taken from them
 saansad kehete he ki police vaale unase vasuuli karte he to kyon naa unhen suraksha di jaae
 Said, what more money will i take from you? Aaj Tak's questions provoked BJP MP Udit Raj saying that i have formed and will build a dozen organizations
 chaahe jitna man karegaa utane paise luungaa aapse kya? rehadi-patari lagane vaale ko adhikaar kisne diya ye puche jane par udit raaj ne kaha ki hamane unako license nahin die hai bas unako unka pahchaan di he
 Accused on Delhi Police, said the police makes recovery, Udit Raj said many times in his statement that the police charge money from street-side street workers, so for their safety we formed their organization and gave them an identity
 haalanki baad main jab ajtak samvaadadaata ne kaha ki sarkaar aapaki he police centre sarkaar ke hi adheen he to udit raaj baat ghuma baithe bole ilaake ke gunde log unase paise lete hai
 The media does not see good work, BJP MP said it is reasonable to take money from the street laborers in the name of organization, as the BJP MP said, the media does not see good work
 maine paise sanghathan ke naam par liye jitna man karegaa utana luungaa
 After the prime time that Marathi films got in the multiplexes of Maharashtra, now the hope of reservation among filmmakers for independent cinema or even small budget films is starting to arise
 badi commercial filmon ke saamne in filmon ko box ofis par vajood talashne main badi mushkil pesh aati he
 Therefore, after the Maharashtra government's admiration for Marathi films, expectations are also raised for filmmakers who believe in low budget films and strong storylines
 choti filmon ko bhi cinemaghar naseeb hon isliye jane maane filmkaar dibaakar banerjee or sanjay pooran singh chouhan jaise filmkaaron ne enditivi se kaha ki kam bajet kii acchhee filmon ko bhi screen mili isliye har zarurat madad unhen milani chahie
 TV actor Jai Bhanushali also joined the campaign and said that by doing this, new producers will get an opportunity to come forward and actors in the industry will get good acting opportunities
 har saal kareeb 150 marathi filmein release hoti hai vahiin 100 ke kareeb swatantra filmein, jinhen bade binar or bade star kaa koi sahaara nahin miltaa
 So after seeing the criticism given to the Marathi films being given, it will have to be seen whether the government looks at this new hope or not? bhartiya praudyogiki santhaan (iity) bombai ke chetan solanki se baat karte hue aapako nahin lagegaa ki ve urja or ejineering vibhaag main professor hai
 He would like you more than a spiritual sociologist, who almost disowns us with his arguments especially on solar solutions to energy needs
 saura urja ke kshetra main unke kaam ko dekhte hue unhen 'solar main of india' bhi kaha jane laga he
 "technology that purifies human behavior and thinking is ultimately acceptable
" vigyaan or praudyogiki ko antim satya maan lene se jo samasyaayein paidaa hui hai ve ab nae-nae rup dharti ja rahi hai
 The character of technology is variability
 vah baadhaon se ladgaye kii kshamta to badhaati he lekin shanti, ahimsa, dayaa, karunaa or maitribhav jaise shaashvat mulyon ke bina adhuri rah jaati he
 Since we have deviated from the eternal values, we are also left behind in reconciling technology
 technology kaa laabh lene ke liye aadhyatmik gunon kaa vikaas bhi nirantar jari rahe
 This is necessary for every society
 ''solanki in dinon gandhi global solar yatra par hai
 Starting from Gandhiji's Sabarmati Ashram last year, he has traveled to 30 countries so far
 mishan he solar urja ke upyog ko badhaava dekar vaishvik tapan or jalwaayu parivartan ke khataron se logon ko aagaah karnaa
 He shared some of his experiences last week before returning from a visit to the US, Europe and African countries and then to Australia, New Zealand via Thailand, Cambodia
 mahatma gandhi kii 150veen jayanti ke maukey par professor solanki chaahate hai ki agle 2 aktubar ko puri duniya ke 10 lakh bachche milakar ek saath apana solar lamp banaaen or roshni kaa adhikaar sabit karen
 They believe that this is a good opportunity to put Gandhi's ideas into practice
 puri duuniya ko isaki jarurat he
 "sunlight is for everyone and everyone has the right to light
" iskaa upyog karte hue prakruti se dosti badhanaa bhi is mishan kaa uddeshy he
 Every child should get the light of his need irrespective of the country he lives in
 solar urja technology se yah sambhav he
 "combining nature and technology: Solanki believes that" Technology that deepens the friendship between society and nature is in dire need today
 prakruti ke prati hinsak sabit ho rahi technology kaa ham beja istemaal kar rahe hai or iske dushprinaamon ke prati laaparvaah bhi hai
 From this perspective, i consider solar energy technology to be a humanistic technology
 yah maanavtaa ke mahaan chintak gandhi ke us vichaar ko bhi abhivyakt karti he ki prithvi har manushya kii aavashyaktaa kii purti to kar sakati he lekin laalach kii nahin
 "lack of Committed Leadership: Sharing Experiences of Overseas Tours Taking Solar Energy Technology and the" One Million Solar Lamp "mission, Solanki explains," From America to South Africa, there is a common problem that technology wants everyone But there is no way to show gratitude to nature
 duusari badi samasya he technology ke bich takaraav
 Solar energy provides electricity and light, but the violence towards nature by running air conditioners continues
 ab puure vishwa main sirf prakruti hitaishi technology chunane kaa samay aa gaya he
 "can this work be done by governments?" According to Solanki, "this is not possible because governments want immediate results
" ve aise kaam main apni urja or sansaadhan lagane se bachati hai jiske dirghakaalik parinaam milte hon
 This is possible only with the moral pressure or behavior change of the conscious people
 phir bhi yah koi mushkil kaam nahin lekin har desh main patibaddh netritv kii jarurat he, chaahe vah rajnatik ho yaa vaigyanik yaa phir saamaajik
 "technology Literacy: One of the most prestigious institutions of technical education in the world, referring to the Gandhi Global Solar Tour and lectures on his mission at MIT, USA, Professor Solanki explains that there" The air conditioner user Everyone is behaving violently towards the environment
 jo air condishan thandak dete hai, yadi unase nikalne vaali hydrophlorocarbon kamare main hi chhod di jaae to chand minuton main dam ghut jayega
 After the lecture, several people sitting in the hall recently appeared to agree not to use the air conditioner
 solanki kaa kahana he ki technology sakshartaa bhi ab saath-saath chalani chahie taaki logon ko kisi bhi technology ke gun, avagun kii acchhee jaankaree rahe
 Urja Swaraj: Professor Solanki has shown how to use natural energy by setting up an education park school in a small Bhikangaon district in Khargone, Madhya Pradesh
 is bhawan kii dizin kuch yun kii gai he ki yah prakritik air condishnar kii tarah kaam kare
 It was here that he took primary education in the nearby village of Nemit where the school had a teacher and a class
 yahaan mitti tel ke chiraag kaa upyog hota tha
 On his journey from here to become a phd from IMEC in Belgium and a professor at IIT Bombay, Solanki has set out to pursue technology knowledge and expertise in the interest of society
 gandhi ji ke vyaktitv or darshan se gahare prabhavit solanki aajkal urja swaraj par kitaab likh rahe hai
 He explains, "my experiments with truth are the inspiration of the book
 Gandhiji's autobiography
 solar technology kaa jo satya he uske saath prayog par bhi nai drushti ke saath likhaa jaae taaki ise samajhnaa or aasaan ho jaae
 His simple argument is: Solar technology is purely natural
 har vyakti ko apni jarurat kii urja aasaani se mil sakati he
 In every society of the world, Sun is considered as a symbol of power and is respected
 isse prakruti ko samajhane kaa mauka miltaa he ise aadar bhav se dekhne kaa sanskaar bhi
 Nature itself is a vast technological system
 yah karodon jeev jantuon ko jivan jeene main sahyog karti he
 How to adopt technology? In response, he describes the experience of setting up a Dungarpur Renewable Energy Technology Limited company with a solar module in Rajasthan, how tribal women are running their company and training others
 is pahal ke liye unhen or duungrpur jila prashasan ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne sammanit kiya tha
 "there has been a considerable change in the social behavior and way of thinking of these women
 ve prakruti ko bhi samaj rahi hai or technology ko bhi

 insaan apane karmon se apni takadir likhata he or karmon ke aadhaar par hi vah apane bhavishya kaa nirmaan karata he
 But in the process, some such misdeeds happen inadvertently, due to which a person becomes a victim of some curse
 isaki kai vajahen ho sakati hai, masalan usne apana daayitv sahi tarah na nibhaayaa ho yaa phir use yah vriksh vagairah kaatane se mila ho
 But there are only Goddesses in this world who can get you free from any kind of curse
 kya hota he shrapais sansar main kai tarah ke shraap hote hai or ye kai alag-alag kaarnon se paidaa ho jate hai
 When a person does not know the cause and prevention of the consequences of misdeeds, it is called curse
 shraap ko ek nishchit avadhi tak bhogana padataa he or kabhi-kabhi yah itnaa kathor hota he ki kai janmon tak peechha nahin chodta
 Shiva can somehow relieve the pain and suffering
 kya aapaki kundali main shraap haishrap ke bare main kundali se pataa karnaa hi sabase sateek tarika mana jaataa he
 Curses occur in the horoscope
 
 
 - jab kundali main rahu kii sthiti karaab ho- jab kundali main surya or shani kaa sambandh ho- jab kundali main shani ke saath rahu kaa sambandh ho- jab haathon ke bichombich til hokin dushkarmon se miltaa he shraapaye kuch aise kaaran hai jinke bare main insaan sochataa bhi nahin he or kabhi kabhi jane anjaane main galtiyaan kar baithta he
 In such a situation, curses do not give up the pursuit of human beings for many births: - not fulfilling their obligations, due to which people suffer - cutting green trees without need or using green trees for their own selfishness - abortion or getting done - special Killing or getting a woman's womb in form - deceit with her husband, wife or friend - disobeying her master's command - insulting the teacher to get rid of curse Ways if you do not fulfill your responsibilities - carry out your responsibilities properly in the future - distribute medicines in the hospital and serve the patients if green trees are cut down - plant lots of trees that live long - add water to plants everyday - waste water Avoid- Chant 'un Gangadharay Namah' every morning in the morning- 'awake Namo Bhagwate Rudray' before sunrise Chant and do not eat food grains on Monday, if you have been forced or have done it - go to any place of Jyotirling and stay for a month - offer water and bell letters to Shiva Ji every morning - recite 'shiva Crime Pardon Stotra' - poor girls If you have insulted Guru for taking responsibility of marriage - ask for regular forgiveness from him- show the path of knowledge and liberation to other people - recite Rudrashak any Remember the expressions of devotion to Lord Shiva from the curse of living for those as well as you can create a happy life through these measures
 india get se gaayab hui maasoom jahnavi kii jindagi main gujarey yahi wo aath din the, jo kabhi naa bhulane vaale din sabit hue
 Lucky Jahnavi gets back to her family, but where and how did she stay in these mysterious eight days? And how did this girl's family member become a victim of the whole of India? In the incident, each day they had a shocking truth
 darasal, dilli ke raghubeeranagar main rahane vaala ahuja parivaar 28 sintabar yani ravivaar kii shaam ko india get par ghoomane gaya tha
 But it is no night 9
 15 baje kaa vakt rahaa hoga, jab jahnavi ke gharavaalon ne achaanak ye mahasoos kiya ki unki ladli ab unke saath nahin he
 Apparently, the sudden disappearance of Kaleje's piece was nothing short of a shock to the Ahuja family
 wo paaglon kii tarah jahnavi ko dhundhate rahe or india get kaa chappa-chappa chaan maaraa
 But the result cipher
 haar kar jahnavi ke gharavaalon ne police se shikaayat kii or police ne der-saver is silsile main report darj kar tafteesh shuru kar di
 But in this connection, when police searched footage of CCTV cameras installed around India Gate, a shocking picture of Jahnavi was seen in it
 kyonki in tasveeron main jahnavi chalati hui apane gharavaalon se dur to jaati dikhi or iske baad wo camere kii range se baahar chali gai
 In such a situation, who had taken Jahnavi and on which side, no one had the answer
 maa-baap kaa dil aakhir chup kaise baithta?jaahir he, in halaat main police bhi chaah kar kuch nahin kar sakati thi
 But how does the parents' heart sit silent? So, the Ahuja family started a campaign in search of Jahnavi, who moved out of this house in Raghubir Nagar a few days later to become the campaign of the whole of India
 ek aisi muhim jiske peeche naa to kisi siyaasi party kaa haath tha or naa hi kisi badi company kaa paisa
 But social media and then media efforts like this campaign gave wings
 whats app or fasebuk par ab jahnavi kii tasviren viral ho gayi
 Not many, but many photographs of Jahnavi passing over two days
 smartphone or televijan ke jariye har kisi ke ab ghar main pahunch chuki thi
 And perhaps it was the wonder of social media and media that despite being unaware of Jahnavi, crores of people started feeling connected with Jahnavi
 kahin naa kahin har dil main jahnavi ke gaayab hone kii kasak paidaa ho gai
 And somewhere, everyone started wishing that Jahnavi returned to his house as soon as possible
 ye media kaa kamaal hi tha ki kal kii gumnaam jahnavi ko ab puri duniya jaanane lagi
 And it was the wonder of the media, which caused the disappearance of Jahnavi in every heart
 har koi ab ye chaahane laga tha ki chaahe jaise bhi ho, jahnavi uske gharavaalon ko waapas mil jaae
 But this task was not so easy
 lekin jahnavi ke gaayab hone or milane ke in saat dinon ke pal-pal kii kahani bhi kam chaunkaanewaali nahin rahi
 It was not easy, because of the condition of innocent policeman Janhvi who had gone missing, it was so clear that this girl did not go anywhere on her own
 balki india get jaisi bheed-bhaad or hai security vaali jagah se uskaa gaayab hona ye sabit karne ke liye kaaphi tha ki jahnavi ko koi maukey se uthaa le gaya
 Apparently, whoever did this did not want to return Jahnavi in any case, nor did he allow this distinction to be revealed and it was these things that made the police work even more difficult
 police ne jahnavi ke gaayab hone kii report darj kar uski talash shuru kar di thi
 From the entire CCTV footage of India Gate, the entire area was searched
 ek taraf jahaan police ne uski talash main parche chhapavaaye or unhen dilli ke tamaam thanon or rihaayshi ilaakon main lagavaaya, vahiin duusari taraf paanch alag-alag timen bana kar is bacchee kii talash shuru kii gai
 On the other hand, people were continuously intensifying their campaign on social media in search of innocent Jahnavi
 lekin jahnavi kaa koi suraag nahin tha
 Till the track The Missing Children, the police had also reported the disappearance of Jahnavi to several websites such as Track the Missing Children including the nodal agency ie CBI
 chunki gharavaale india get aane se pehle gurudwara bangala sahib jane kii baat police ko bataa chuke the, police ne bangala sahib samet tamaam gurudwaron ke aas-paas bhi jahnavi ko dhundha
 But nothing came out
 sisitivi se koi suraag nahin milane kii baat sun kar ab gharavaalon kaa hausala kamjor padane laga tha
 But he did not give up hope
 or soshal media ke baad ab media ne jahnavi ke gharavaalon kii aawaaj buland kerani shuru kar di
 Here, due to non-availability of Jahnavi, the family members were constantly complaining to the police
 or udhar police maamle kii najaakat ko dekhte hue bacchee ko ji-jaan se talashne main lagi thi
 Apart from this, Delhi Police also put their Super Cops team ie Special Cell and Crime Branch in search of Jahnavi
 police intelligence develop karne par jor dene lagi
 But no clue was found even this day

 On Christmas day when the whole country was celebrating
 usee din dilli ke sarojini nagar ilaake main teen yuvakon ne ek 19 saal kii ladki ke saath gangrape kii sharmnaak vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 Information about the incident was given to the police by calling the victim's number 100
 ladki ne police ko bataaya ki wo modelling kii duniya main apni kismat aajamaa rahi he
 About two months ago, she was in Mumbai in this connection
 vahaan uski mulaakaat dilli ke satish naam ke ladke se ho gai
 Satish told the girl that she had a good acquaintance in Delhi
 agar ladki dilli chalegi to vahaan uski mulaakaat wo ek doirector se kara saktaa
 The girl came under the influence of accused Satish
 ladki dilli aa gai or yahaan par jamiya nagar main kiraye par rahane lagi
 The girl alleges that for the last 15 days, Satish was twisting the girl somewhere
 christmas se ek din pehle 24 ko aaropee ne peedit ladki ko kol karke south dilli ke ek bade mal main bulaayaa
 There he also had a friend named Jaggi along with Satish
 mal main sabhi logon ne party kii or uske baad satish ladki ko lekar sarojini nagar ilaake main ek flats main pahunchaa
 There he already had a friend named Harendra
 aarope he ki yaheen par kuch nashila padaarth khilaa kar ladki ke saath teenon nerepakia
 On the night of 25, when the girl was fully conscious, she immediately called 100
 maukey par police turant pahunch gai or aaropee satish or jaggi ko vahiin se hiraasat main le liya
 Later, after confirming the rape in the medical police, the police arrested the two accused by registering FIA under the section of gang rape

 a hallmark of what leaders do for publicity was seen when BJP leader Vani Tripathi created a ruckus over an incident in the incident
 lekin ajtak ke paas wo dastavej he jisase vaani kii pole khul gai
 Misbehavior and molestation of the national female leader of the National Party in Delhi
 sunakar yakeen nahin ho rahaa he lekin bijepi kii rashtriya sachiv vaani treepathi ne 5 ladakon par bilkul yahi iljaam lagaaya he
 BJP national secretary Vani Tripathi, who lives in Delhi, alleges that when she was passing in her car from the area of greater Kailash Part 2 in Delhi at around 9
30 pm on Thursday night, her car was hit by an SUV from behind
 Granted
 us gaadi main kareeb 4-5 log baithe the or wo nashe main bhi the
 Later on protesting, they not only misbehaved with Vani but also tried to molest him
 badasluki kaa aarope or wo bhi bijepi kii rashtriya sachiv ke saath
 Apparently there was an uproar in a short time
 lekin is maamle kaa ek doosraa pahalu bhi he
 The boys accused of misconduct say that this is just a case of a small road accident in which Vaani Tripathi is also at fault
 baavjood iske unhone vaani treepathi ko 15 hajaar rupye diye or siaar park thane main likhit samjhauta bhi hua
 On which Vani is signed by Tripathi, despite this she is making false statements
 aropiyon ke sawaal isliye bhi vaazib ho sakate hai kyonki jab vaani tripani ne samjhaute ke tahat 15 hajaar rupye hasil kar hi liye to phir baad main itani haituba kyon machaai
 If the boys had committed a serious crime, then why did they agree with the money
 sachai chaahe jo bhi ho lekin saream hue is maamle me donon paksho ke paas apane apane tark hai
 Therefore, the police also do not want to hurry in this case and after conducting an investigation, are talking about registering a case

 telecom sector main chal rahi pratispardhaa ke bich ab vodaphone ne 199 rupee or 399 rupee vaale apane do preeped plance main kuch badlaav kiya he
 These changes have been made in select circles
 badlaav ke baad in donon plance main graahakon ko ab zyada data milegaa
 Let us tell you that before Airtel also changed its plan of Rs 199 and started more data
 vodaphone ab apane 199 rupee or 399 rupee vaale donon preeped plan main roj 100MB data zyada degaa
 That means now 1 daily total
 5GB 2G / 3G / 4G data graahakon ko milegaa
 In this way, customers will get a total of 42GB 4G data with a validity of 28 days in the plan of Rs 199
 data ke saath hi analimited neshnal, local, roming kol or SMS bhi milegaa
 First, 1 daily in this plan
 4GB data diya jaataa tha
 After the change, in the plan of Rs 399, the customers are now 1 with a validity of 84 days (select users)
 5GB data milegaa
 Also, the benefits of calling and SMS will be given in this plan
 aapako bataa den pehle isi plan main 70 dinon kii validity ke saath roj 1
 4GB of data was provided
 yani ab validity ko bhi badha diya gaya he
 However, the benefit of 84 days validity is being given only to Chunninga users
 graahak ye bhi dhyaan rakhen ki in donon plance main badlaav philhal chuninda cirkilon main hi kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, customers should also keep in mind that some limits have also been fixed in these plans
 graahakon ke liye in plan main colling ko lekar rojaanaa 250 minute or ek hafte main 1000 minute kii baadhyataa rahegi
 Similarly, once the daily fixed data is over, customers will have to pay 50 paise per MB for the data
 airtel ne bhi badla planhaal hi main airtel ne bhi apana 199 rupee vaala plan badla he
 According to the report of telecomtalk, Airtel first in its 199 rupees plan
 4GB data detii thi, ab company roj 1
 Will provide 5GB of data
 haalanki zyada data dene ke baavjood company abhi bhi jeeyo ke 198 rupee vaale plan se peeche he
 Because 2GB data is given daily in Jio's Rs 198 plan
 yani airtel ke plan main ab kul 42GB 4G milegaa vahiin jeeyo kii ore se kul 56GB data diya ja rahaa he
 It is expected that in the coming days, Vodafone Idea will also make some changes in the plan of Rs 199
 airtel ke 199 rupee vaale plan ke bare main vistaar se baat karen to ye ek open market plan he jo sabhi airtel preeped yugers ke liye maujuud he
 As a reminder, the Rs 199 plan has been introduced earlier this year, when live 1 per day
 5GB or 2GB data vaala plan lekar ai thi
 Now 1 daily in this plan of Airtel
 5GB data, analimited local, astidi or neshnal roming colls ke saath 28 dinon ke liye 100 SMS milegaa

 6 pakistan kii napak harkaton kaa munhtod jawaab dene ke liye bharat har vikalp par vichaar kar rahaa he
 India can review the waters of the Indus River
 iske liye piem modi ne somvaar ko jal sansaadhan or videsh mantralay ke adhikariyon kii baithak lee he
 The advantages and disadvantages of this agreement are discussed in the meeting
 haalanki is mudde par abhi kya faisla hua he uski jaankaree abhi nahin mili he
 Experts - Immediately cancel the agreement
 The way the Ministry of External Affairs of India, the spokesperson of Indus Water Agreement, from the experts to the political corridors welcomed this statement, because if India takes this step, then a large part of Pakistan will be given to the people
 You may have to yearn for every drop of water
 videsh maamalon ke jaankaar brahmachelani kaa maananaa he ki bharat ko bina vakt gavaaye 1960 main hue sindhu nadi jal samjhaute ko radd kar dena chahie, kyonki aisa hone par pakistan kaa bada ilaaka registan main tabdeel ho jayega
 The Indus River flows through Jammu and Kashmir into Pakistan
 bharat kii ore se sindhu nadi jal samjhauta radd kiye jane par pakistan ko diya jane vaala sindhu nadi kaa pani roak diya jayega
 The Indus River is called the lifeline of Pakistan
 sindhu nadi par hi pakistan kii sinchai vyavastha or kheti tiki he
 In a special conversation with 'aaj Tak', Brahmachelani said that just as China does not believe in any kind of water treaty and takes water from the rivers that connect India with the Sutlej and Brahmaputra according to their mind, in the same way, India is without any mercy with that Pakistan
 The treaty must be broken, which has been fighting a proxy war with India for years without stopping
 raavi or jhelum kaa pani bhi roka jayega!gauratlab he ki 1948 main donon deshon kaa bantwaaraa hone ke kuch maheene baad hi bharat ne sindhu nadi kaa pani roak diya tha
 For this, Pakistan had to work hard from 1953-1960
 pakistan ke saalon tak gidgidaane ke baad 19 sitambar 1960 ko bharat ke saath sindhu nadi jal samjhauta hua
 Since then, Pakistan has been using this water indiscriminately
 pakistan ke liye isse bhi badi chintaa kii baat yah he ki raavi or jhelum nadiyaan bhi bharat se hokar pakistan ke punjab praant main jaati hai
 If the Indus river water agreement is canceled, the water of Ravi and Jhelum rivers can also be stopped
 aisa hone se pakistan kii krishi vyavastha chaupat ho jaaegi

 This person is nominated by Roy and is an international photographer today
 bachapan main kooda binane vaale us mashhoor photographer viki roy kaa janm pashchim bengal ke purulia main hua tha
 There was an atmosphere of poverty and violence in the house
 isliye viki ghar se bhaag gaya
 But before fleeing, he stole Rs 900 from his uncle and reached Delhi with a railway ticket
 dilli aane par vah kooda binane vaale bacchon ke saath milakar apana guzaara karne laga
 Then got work in a restaurant
 vahiin ek graahak ne viki ko 'salaam balak trust' se sampark karaayaa
 When Vicky's Trust met two photographers, Vicky got admission in 6th class and somehow he passed 10th class
 viki open larning ke ek santhaan main jaataa tha jahaan uski mulaakaat 2 photographer se hui
 Actually, the photographers there used to give photography training to the children, Vicky also started seeing all this and learned a lot about photography
 phir ek din saal 2004 main dixi benjamin 'salaam balak trust' aae
 When Dixie offered to become an assistant in front of Vicky, Vicky was no longer happy
 viki ko dikji ne ek camera bhi kharid kar diya
 After this, Vicky's feet were not on the ground
 (viki roy kii lee hui tasviren)nahin dekha peeche mudakarye din tha or aaj kaa din he, viki ne kabhi peeche palat kar nahin dekha
 In 2007, Vicky did a solo show
 saal 2009 main use america ke 'baak foundation' ke ek mentorship program ke liye chun liya gaya
 Here he spent 6 months photographing the reconstruction works of the World Trade Center in New York
 yahaan usne jo kaam kiya vah bahut saare antarrashtriya pradarshaniyon kaa hissaa bana
 His photography has also garnered many accolades at such famous places as London's Whitechapel Gallery and Switzerland's Photo Museum

 His first book was released in 2013, titled 'home Street Home'
 jise logon ne khaasaa pasand kiya
 Vicky now helps economically weaker students in her own way and also teaches photography to them

 aam aadmi sochataa he ki raksha mantralay kaa arth sirf seemaa, chhavniyaan or hathiyaar jutanaa hi hota he
 He also said about the terror attack in Nagrota that it is painful to see the soldiers dying
 iske alaava rakshaamantri ne kaha ki badlaav ko sweekaar karnaa hameshaa mushkil hota he
 It is not easy for the common citizen to accept any change, and traditions are very important
 sena main bhi puraani manyataon ko badalanaa aasaan nahin he

 Congress leader and Punjab government minister Navjot Singh Sidhu's statement in Katihar may weigh on him
 jis tarah ke bayaan ke aadhaar par chunaav ayog ne mayawati par 48 ghante chunaav prachaar karne par pratibandh lagaaya he usee tarah kaa bayaan siddhu ne katihaar se chunaav lard rahe tarik anwar ke paksh main prachaar karte hue diya tha
 Meanwhile, the Election Commission has taken cognizance of Navjot Singh Sidhu's statement in Katihar
 chunaav ayog ne katihaar ke chunaav adhikari se report talab kar lee he
 The Election Commission has sought a CD of the statement of Navjot Singh Sidhu and a transcript of the statement
 netaaon ke bhaashan par chunaav ayog kii sakhti lagaataar badhati ja rahi he to netaaon kii badjubaani bhi rukne kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 Addressing a gathering in Balrampur assembly light of Katihar parliamentary constituency, Navjot Singh Sidhu told the Muslim voters that you should be a majority here even though you are a minority
 navjot singh siddu ne kaha apane sambodhan main ye bhi kaha ki aap agar ekajutata dikhaaenge to ummidavaar tarik anwar ko koi nahin haraa saktaa
 The BJP has decided that Sidhu will be lodged with the Election Commission regarding this statement
 ab congress ke star prachaarak navjot singh siddhu kaa ek bayaan saamne aayaa he, jisamen vah muslim samudaay se ekajute hokar congress party ke liye matdaan karne kii apil kar rahe hai
 Sidhu has given this statement in Katihar, Bihar
 katihaar loksabhaa kii balrampur vidhansabha main jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue navjot singh siddhu ne kaha ki aap kii aisi loksabhaa he jahaan alpsankhyak bhi bahusankhyak he, isliye aap agar ekajutata dikhaaenge to tarik anwar ko koi nahin haraa saktaa he
 Navjot Singh Sidhu said in the rally, "here politics is being divided in casteism, i have come to say the same thing to my Muslim brothers, your area is where you are not being a minority but a majority
 is kshetra main aapkaa varchasv 62 fisadi kaa he or ye bijepi vaale shadyantrakaari log aapako baantne kaa prayaas karenge, aap ikaithe rahen to congress ko duniya kii koi takat haraa nahin sakegi
 "apart from this, Navjot Singh Sidhu also targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party at this rally and compared PM Modi to Fangoo
 isse pehle basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne bhi aisa hi bayaan diya tha, jise aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan maanate hue chunaav ayog ne 48 ghante ke liye mayawati ke prachaar par pabandi lagaai he
 Mayawati had also made a similar statement prohibiting the campaigning of Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati for 48 hours
 mayawati ne devband kii raily main muslim samudaay ke logon se ekajute hokar mahagathbandhan ke liye matdaan karen
 Under the rules of the Code of Conduct, no leader, candidate or party can ask for votes on the basis of religion nor can it appeal to any community for a united vote
 mayawati ke alaava chunaav ayog ne upi siem yogi adityanath ke ali-bajrangbali vaale bayaan par bhi sakhti dikhaai thi
 The commission had banned the promotion of Yogi for 72 hours
 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main
 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter jharkhand chunaav main bijepi ko apano se hi khatradusri party se aae netaaon ne badhaai chintajharkhand main bhaajapa kaa badhata kunba vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan party ke liye hi musiibat ban saktaa he
 Congress and JMM mlas joining the BJP can cause trouble for the old BJP
 bhaajapa main shaamil hue vidhayakon ko unke kshetron se tikat milane kii puri sambhaavna bhi he
 In such a situation, BJP leaders already preparing for the election may get a shock and they can also give a blow to the party
 pichley 4 maheene main hajaaron logon ne gaaje-baaje ke saath bijepi kaa jhanda thama he
 a competition is being seen these days among the people who have come from other parties to the BJP and the old claimants of the party
 isse kuch siton par bhitarghaat kii ashanka bad gai he
 Simply put, during the elections, the BJP may face a big challenge from its own leaders
 haalanki, pradesh adhyaksh lakshmana gilua kaa kahana he ki sabhi ko bina shart party main shaamil karaayaa gaya he or jeetne vaale candidet ko hi tikat milegaa
 In recent times, 5 mlas who have joined BJP have increased the concern of BJP leaders
 ipies arun ne bhaajapa kaa daaman thamkar vidhansabha adhyaksh sah sisai vidhayak dinesh uraanv or gumla vidhayak shivashankar uraanv kii dhadakanen badha di hai
 Sameer Mohanty, who has been waiting for tickets for years due to Kunal Shadangi, who entered BJP from JMM, has joined JMM
 isi tarah barhi se congress vidhayak manoj yadav ke bijepi main aane se akelaa yadav kii mushkilen bad gai hai
 Yadav alone said that he will go to jail for the workers and Manoj Yadav will not get the ticket
 ashanka he ki tikat kii ghoshnaa hone ke saath hi kuch netaa khulkar baghawat kar sakate hai to kuch asahyogaatmak ravaiya akhriyaar kar sakate hai
 With the involvement of Sukhdev Bhagat in Lohardaga, allies of Ajsu are being seen
 haalanki, abhi tak yah tay nahin he ki yah seat bhaajapa ke paas rahegi yaa ajasu ke paas
 Apart from this, there are many other seats from where the claimants of BJP have been shocked by those who joined the party from other parties
 jeemem se bijepi main aane vaale mandu se vidhayak jepi patel kii vajah se vahaan ke tikat kii aas main kaaryakartaaon kii bechaini kaaphi bad gai he
 The party's Rajya Sabha MP Sameer Oran says that it is not possible to give tickets to all the leaders joining the BJP
 party main tikat kii ghoshnaa se purv bhaajapa main is vishay par charchaa se har koi kataraa rahaa he
 But the possibility of this internal infighting of the BJP after the announcement of the ticket cannot be ruled out
 jaahir he bhaajapa ko bhi is baat kaa ehsaas he or vah abhi se is aantarik takaraav ko taalane kii jugat main jute gai he
 In the last session of India Today sos Bihar, Chief Minister of the state Nitish Kumar attended the closing speech
 nitish ne mukhyamantri ke rup main november, 2005 main kursi sanbhaalane se lekar ab tak bihar main apane netritv main hue vikaas or saamaajik badlaav kaa khaakaa pesh kiya
 During this, he discussed the policy of development with justice and also said that politics would be done not only by playing the tongue but also by working
 is dauraan unhone alag-alag muddon par apni baat rakhi
 Twelve and a half% children were from schools, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said during the closing speech, "I took charge as CM in November 2005
 hamane sabase pehle survey kiya ki shiksha, swasthya or buniyadi dhaanche ko lekar rajya kii kya sthiti he
 Then it turned out that 12
 5 fisadi bachche skulon se baahar hai
 Why did i take initiative on education and health? aapako ek vakya bataata hum
 i was returning from my parliamentary constituency
 ek gaanv main main rukaa or logon se baat karne laga
 Found a child
 usne poocha ki sar, kya ham log padhenge nahin? skool main master nahin hai, skool kii building nahin he
 Let me tell you one more thing that people in our village can also be heard saying Sir
 siem banane par hamane muft main poshaak, copy-kitaab or cycle dene jaisi yojanaayen lagu kin
 Today the number of out of school children is less than 1 percent
 ek duusari ghatana bataata hum
 We were sitting in the meeting in our parliamentary constituency
 ek garib aadmi dur se dekh rahaa tha
 i let him come forward
 tab usne kaha ki sarkari aspataal thik se kaam kare
 When we conducted the survey, it was found that on average, only 39 patients used to go to a PHC every month in Bihar
 tab hamane doctoron or para-medical staff kaa tabadalaa piechasi main karne kaa nirnay liya or muft main dawa dene kaa bhi faisla kiya
 Now 11 thousand people are going to a PHC in a month
 or main kya kahuun? aspataal kii sthiti sudhari he
 But people's expectations are increasing
 pehle to koi ummid bhi nahin karata tha
 It took 3 hours to go 50 km
 Nitish Kumar said that what was the condition of the roads when he was not the Chief Minister
 unhone apana anubhav saajha karte hue kaha- patna se nikalne par 20 kilometre kii duuri se meraa sansadeey kshetra shuru hota tha
 It took three hours to cover a distance of 50 kilometers in that round
 ham kai baar chunaav prachaar karne bakhtiyarpur tak train se jate the
 This was the condition of the National Highway
 siem banane par hamane sadakon ko durust karne kaa nirnay liya
 First rectified the state roads and then requested the Central Government for the National Highway
 us par 900 karod rupye kharch kiye, vah paisa aaj tak nahin mila
 Village hamlets also connected the main roads
 baad main 6 ghante main kisi bhi andruni ilaake se patna pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa
 That goal is now almost done
 ab 5 ghante kaa lakshya tay kiya he
 Fixed a 7-year policy for maintenance of roads
 sirf badi sadakon ke liye nahin balki gramin sadakon ke liye bhi mentanence policy banaai
 How was the bicycle scheme made? Nitish Kumar said, We are doing the work to fulfill the basic needs
 ham logon kii buniyadi niti nyaay ke saath vikaas kii he
 We planned to dress for girls in middle school
 jab skool main poshaak yojana shuru kii to gaanv kaa maahaul badal gaya
 An equal development plan was started during the NDA government
 patna jile main isi skim ke tahat 180 ladakiyon ko cycle di gai thi
 i loved that scene
 us kaarykram se lautate samay varisht adhikariyon ko bulaakar poocha ki kitni ladkiyaan 9 veen class main padhati hai? tab pataa chalaa ki 1
 70 lakh girls study in IX
 tab hamane ladakiyon ko cycle dene kaa faisla kiya
 When the girls got bicycles, they started going to school in village-to-village groups
 tab logon ke dimag main badlaav aa gaya
 After two years, this scheme was implemented for boys also
 aaj 8 lakh ladkiyaan sarkari skulon main 9 veen class main pard rahi hai
 He is giving loan for education Nitish Kumar said that we had made seven decisions
 usamen ek nishchay yah tha ki student credit card ke jariye chaatro ko ucch shiksha ke liye bataur karj 4 lakh rupye 4 fisadi byaaj kii dar se dene kii yojana lagu kii
 This loan is being given at the rate of 1 percent to girls, disabled and transgender
 ab tak 18 hajaar chaatro ko yah karj diya ja chukaa he
 Implemented Skilled Youth Program for non-studying youth

 First computer, second- communication skills and third- behavioral skills

 We created the Agriculture Roadmap
 pehla rodmap 2008 main lagu karne ke baad 2012 main ham rashtriya ausat tak pahunch gaye

 bharat, england or america in teen mahadeshon kaa lagaataar daura kar raheen nandana sen ‘rang rasiyaa’ ke pramotion ke liye bharat lauti hai
 Nandana is very happy with the response the film is receiving
 abhinay ke alaava bacchon ke liye likhane main juty nandana se unki film ‘rang rasiyaa’ ke silsile main hui khaas baatcheetahraja ravi verma ke liye sugandha prerana thi jise unhone devi ke rup main darshaya
 What is Sugandha for you? Sugandha was not just Raja Ravi Varma's art but it was his love
 sugandha ek devdasi hone ke baavjood itani pavitra thi ki raja ravi verma ko usamen divine gun najar aae
 Her inner beauty and faith-filled innocence were her qualities
 itnaa sab hone ke baavjood sugandha ek saadhaaran ladki thi, jo bhavuk hone ke saath saath adhikaar jamaanevaali, pyaar kii bhukhi tathaa swayan ko us purush par arpan karne ke liye tatpar thi jise vah behad pyaar karti he
 The fragrance was a beautiful blend of sensuality and otherworldliness
 sugandha ke liye aapane kis tarah kii taiyaari kii?mere liye sabase zyada madadgaar raja ravi verma kii paintings sabit huin
 He has portrayed his heroines very beautifully
 jis adaa se vah khadi hai, jis adaa se vah apane haathon se khel rahi hai, jis adaa se vah apni palkon ko jhukaae dekh rahi hai, yah sabhi chijen dekhne yogya hai
 Raja Ravi Varma has portrayed his heroines quite beautiful and attractive
 mere paas raja ravi verma se sambandhit jitani kitaaben thi, vah sab padhi, jisase sugandha ke jivan ko main acchhee tarah se samaj sakuun
 Sugandha was Devadasi, so i read some books related to Devadasi system too
 is kirdaar main khud ko dhaalane ke liye main sara din navvari sari pahana karti thi
 Even in the same veneer, i saw the film 'spiderman' with Siddhivinayak Temple, which was released during that time
 iske alaava sabhi clasical nayikaon, shakuntla, damayanti, urvashi aadi par dobaaraa vichaar kiya kyonki devdasi hone ke baavjood sugandha ek sanskari bhartiya mahila thi
 How was the experience working with Randeep? i am happy that i worked with Randeep Hooda through Rang Rasiya
 main yah baat puure yakeen se kah sakati hum ki is kirdaar ko randeep se acha or koi nahin nibhaa saktaa tha
 Sometimes we used to have mutual differences on some issues, but i ask which there are no differences between thoughtful people
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki in matbhedon ke baavjood hamane eemaandaaree se apana kaam kiya
 Any memorable moment associated with this film? For me the whole film is a memorable moment but living the character of Sugandha has become a memorable moment for my life
 haalanki film ke dauraan kaaphi jabardast durghatana hui thi
 i sprained my leg during a dance sequence with Randeep
 yah jakhm bharaa bhi nahin tha ki achaanak ek seen ke dauraan set par aag lag gai
 Thank God there was no casualty in spite of both these accidents we continued shooting, during that time my legs were in great pain
 aapke pita or pati jon maikinson ne ‘rang rasiyaa’ dekhi?ji haa donon ne yah film dekhi he
 While John is busy arranging screenings for his friends in England, New York and London, Papa is proud of me
 mujhe yaad he is film ko sin karne se pehle apane kirdaar ke bare main maine unase hi ghanton charchaa kii thi to jab unhone yah film dekhi to unhone kaha, 'is kirdaar se adhik mujhe tumhaare abhinay par garv he
 I'm glad you made the right decision at the right time
 iske alaava unhone kethan sar ko bhi kai baar dhanyavad diya ki unhone rajnatik drushti se mahatvapurn or samaaj se sambandhit film banaai
 What would the nude scenes shown in the film have to say regarding the approval of the censor board? i am not surprised to learn that the nude scene of the film has received the approval of the censor
 film kaa vah drishy film kaa kendra bindu he or yah baat vah bhi bhalee bhaanti jaanate hai
 The political message and emotional theatricality in the film revolve around this scene, which is very important to describe
 abhi tak logon ne yah film dekhi nahin he isiilie vah is seen ko prem prasang par aadhaarit seen samaj rahe hai
 An artist creates his art through this scene
 kalakaar ke nazariye se bayaan kiye gaye is seen ke bagaiyr naa sirf hamaari film kii moulikta par prashnchinh lagata balki puri film hi adhuri lagati
 According to everyone who has seen this film, this scene is filmed very beautifully
 mujhe khushi he sensor board ne bhi is film ko sachche darshak ke rup main dekha
 How comfortable was Randeep for this scene? i had 100 percent faith in the film but it was very difficult for me to decide to play this character because personally i am a very private and shy girl
 is kirdaar ko apnaane tathaa nibhaane main randeep se adhik badi bhoomika mere parivaar ne nibhaai
 My parents thought that putting a question mark on this scene is like putting a question mark on the story
 ve bhi is baat se sahamat the ki iske bina film yatharth or prabhaavshaalee nahin ban paaegi
 When i did this scene, i was completely in my character
 tab main sharmili ladki nandana nahin balki sugandha thi jisane apane samay ke saare niyam tod die the
 You have lived a 130 year old character
 saath hi us yug ko parde par saakaar karne main ek bahut badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 What would you like to say about that era, especially about women? i am sad that despite developing economically and socially, there are some evils in our society even today that were in that era
 us yug main sugandha tathaa raja ravi verma ko adaalat main laakar un par mukadmaa chalaaya gaya tha kyonki unhone ek devdasi ke chehre ko devi ke rup main darshaya tha
 This is exactly the same way as i read a controversy in the newspaper about painting my face in the picture of Goddess Lakshmi in this film
 yah bilkul sach he ki is film main meraa cheharaa sirf lakshmi hi nahin balki maa saraswati, menica, sita, draupadi tathaa urvashi ke rup main darshaya gaya he
 i am a religious person myself and i do not want to hurt anyone's religious feelings
 lekin mujhe ham donon ke vivaad main koi fark najar nahin aata
 If the 130-year-old incident is still being repeated today, what did we develop in all these years? asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha-sabhi pakshon ko puraa vakt milanaa chahierushchh ne vivaad main bahes 18 oktober tak khatm karne ko kahasupreme court main ayodhya bhoomi vivaad ko lekar chal rahi bahes khatm hone kii dedline tay ho gai he

 Along with the hearing, on the court's order of arbitration, Asaduddin Owaisi said how the letter was leaked
 mujhe chitthee kaa khel samaj nahin aa rahaa he
 He said how the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena knew that a decision would come in their favor
 abhi to sunwaayee chal rahi he
 The BJP, not the Shiv Sena, will deliver the verdict and we have full faith in that
 asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki har party ko apana paksh rakhane kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 They are keeping their sides
 unhone aage kaha ki meraa kya jawaab ho saktaa he
 The Supreme Court itself has fixed the deadline of 18 October
 sabhi bahes puure hone chahie
 a decision will be given on this
 shivasena kii tippanee par ovaisi ne kaha ki maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav aa rahaa he
 They have nothing to fight in the elections, in which case they are using this matter for their own benefit
 kasee tyaagi ne kaha- jald ho faislasupreme court ke faisle par kasee tyaagi ne kaha ki sabhi log chaahate the ki aapasi baat hi se is maamle kaa hal nikaala jaae
 The other way is the court
 sabhi paksh jaldi sunwaayee ke liye taiyaar the
 He welcomes the court's decision
 hamen ummid he jo faisla hoga, samaaj ke sabhi virgon ko maanya hoga
 On the claim of BJP leaders to build Ram temple, some Tyagi said that this is an attempt to obstruct the ongoing action inside the court
 jab pradhanmantri narendra modi kah chuke hai ki adaalat ke faisle kaa intjaar karnaa chahie, to aisi tatparta kyon he, yah samaj se pare he
 Everyone has the right to speak in his favor
 maamla bahut purana he lihaaja faisla jaldi aae to acha hoga

 bamushkil do hafte baad bharat main sabase zyada aabaadi vaale rajya kaa mukhyamantri apni hi dushman ban chuki samaajawaadee party or apane vibhramit pita ke haathon kathputli main tabdeel kar diya gaya he or unki ungaliyon par naachne ko majaboor he
 It seems that the 76-year-old Mulayam Singh Yadav has come to mind that if the party had not been reduced to five seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections after Akhilesh became the Chief Minister, he could have become the Prime Minister of India
 baar-baar apane milane waalon ke saamne ve is baat ko ab duhara rahe hai
 As a result, Akhilesh has once again ceased to be the chief minister of the same name — this was the notion that he had been trying to throw off the last one and a half years
 party ab puri tarah mulaayam ke niyantran main he jinhen party main dobaaraa ubhare amar singh hawa de rahe hai
 In the language of Akhilesh, the "outsider" hosted by him in Delhi on 11 September became a party to the present crisis of the party
 mulaayam ke sabase chote bhai or akhilesh ke 61 varshiya chachaa shivpal singh yadav is dauraan ek aise shaks ke rup main ubhare jo is haalia paariwarik naatak main akhilesh ke dhur virdohi the
 He has now been made the president of the party in the state instead of Akhilesh
 akhilesh ne jis vivaadaaspad khanan mantri gayatri prajapati ko bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii vajah se unke pad se hataaya tha, unhen bhi behaal kar diya gaya he
 Barring Mulayam's cousin and party general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav, the entire army of uncles and nephews stands firmly behind Shivpal today
 yah aise samay main ho rahaa he jab chunaav ke liye tikat bantwaare kii prakriya shuru hone vaali he
 Akhilesh just has to be content with two things - one is to remove Shivpal from the creamy Ministry of PWD and the other to circumvent the tainted former Chief Secretary of State, Deepak Singhal
 jaisaa party ke ek kaaryakarta ne kaha, ''sandesh saaf he—aap agar bhaiya ke saath khadey hai to samajhie, party ke khilaaf khadey hai
 "what has happened during the past two weeks and the manner in which Mulayam has publicly lynched his son, nothing can be more concise than this (see graphic: Chief Minister's declining stature)
 lakhanu main party mukhyalay main 17 sitambar ko kaaryakartaaon se baatcheet main mulaayam ne gusse main kaha tha, ''akhilesh agar shivpal ko rajya main sapa kaa mukhiya banane se naakhush hai, to unhen yaad rakhana chahie ki janata ne unhen mukhyamantri ke bataur isliye sweekaar kiya he kyonki ve mere bete hai
 He had no standing in politics
 "siyaasi aatmghaatis samooche ghatnakram kii vidambnaa yah he ki agar akhilesh ke liye faislon ko palata nahin gaya hota to aagaamee chunaav main sapa ko bahut madad milti
 Firstly, the Allahabad High Court had to confirm the CBI inquiry order of the alleged mining scam in the state behind the removal of Prajapati
 singhl ko isliye hataaya gaya kyonki amar singh ke saath ve ek khatarnaak jod-tod main lage hue the
 Amar Singh gave a party in Delhi on 11 September
 akhilesh ne usamen jane se inkaar kar diya tha lekin singhl usamen gaye
 There the light talk slowly reached to make fun of Akhilesh in which Singhal was also a happy participant
 yah baat akhilesh tak pahunch gai
 Akhilesh had initially opposed Singhal's appointment on the grounds that his image was that of a broker (he was sent by the Center to the state due to allegations of corruption from the Union Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers)
 akhilesh ne singhl ko is par turant barkhaast karne kaa faisla liya
 Akhilesh felt that both the party and the public would be happy with these decisions and it would work in establishing a clean image before the election, but the opposite happened
 mulaayam ke saath prajapati kii nikatataa or amar singh tathaa shivpal ke saath singhl kii kareebi kii vajah se bade netaaon ne mulaayam ko is baat par raji kar liya ki noujvaan mukhyamantri ke sir par apni vikaas pariyojnaon kii kamyaabi or satta kaa nasha chadh gaya he
 Angry with these decisions, Mulayam first removed Akhilesh from the post of party president in the state and then handed over this responsibility to Shivpal
 akhilesh ne badale main shivpal ko mantripadon se hataa diya jiske baad silsilewar aisa ghatnakram hua jo khud akhilesh kii sharmindagi kii vajah bana
 Now that Shivpal is back in power, he has fallen behind Akhilesh's supporters
 pichley hakrate akhilesh ke samarthan main sadak par utarkar pradarshan karne vaale sapa ke saat yuva kaaryakartaaon ko party se nikaal diya gaya he
 Akhilesh, who is a supporter of the party's student and youth unit, has been warned that action could be taken against him
 ek yuva netaa kehete hai, ''chunaav se pehle hamaara istemaal karne ke bajaae party ne hamen hi nishaanaa banane kaa faisla le liya he
 This is political suicide
 cheharaa sundar banane ke liye ve apni naak kaat rahe hai
 "no matter what the plan b Mulayam thinks, but for Samajwadi Party, this internal war which is open is very damaging
 mulaayam teen baar rajya kii kaman sambhaal chuke hai or akhilesh ne beete dedh saal main jis tarah apane kadam aage badaye the, usase ve ek taaja vikalp ke rup main sthapit ho rahe the
 He was seen as a proud man in comparison to his father's father; He was perceived to be cleaner than his allegedly corrupt uncles
 log unhen aise shaks ke rup main dekh rahe the jo parivaar ke bandhanon se agar aaazaad hota he to badlaav kaa vaahak banane kii kshamta rakhata he
 Now that Akhilesh's face will not be in the front line, the SP will have to find a credible face
 samaajawaadee party ne apni hi daal ko katkar duusare dalon ko mauka de diya he
 They will exploit it
 mayawati kii bispi is maukey kaa istemaal musalamaanon kaa dil jeetne ke liye karegi
 The Congress will try to replace one "youth symbol" with another and hopes that Akhilesh Yadav's votes will be passed on to Rahul Gandhi
 bijepi ko sapa ke pichhadaa vot bank kii darkaar he taaki vah hindu voton ko sangathit kar sake jaisaa usne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kiya tha
 So she will break into a chunk of Yadav votes
 agar is sab kii keemat aakhir main samaajawaadee party ko chukaani padi, to sabase buree haar akhilesh kii hi hogi
 After five years out of power, the SP will be marginalized, especially because Mulayam's health is not good
 akhilesh ab bhi unke iklaute vaaris ke rup main nahin ubhar sake hai, aise main satta se baahar hona unke siyaasi bhavishya ko hameshaa ke liye nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 This was the reason that Akhilesh was constantly trying to embody a parallel idea
 pichley ek saal ke dauraan unhone khud ko vikaas purush ke bataur gande kii koshish kii or is chhavi ko shashakt karne ke peeche unki chah vishaal pariyojnaayen maujuud thim—dilli-lakhanu expresve, 44 jilon ko jodgaye vaale state hive, cancer aspataal, lakhanu metro, antarrashtriya cricket stadium or ity city
 Akhilesh was hopeful that all these projects, to be commissioned by the end of this year, would reflect his forward thinking
 apane raaj ke aarambhik teen varshon main kanoon, bhrashtachar or yadavvaad ke lage aaropon ko unhone apane nijee vyaktitv se santulit karne kaa prayaas kiya tha, lekin chunaav se pehle ve apni vishwasaneeyata ko sthapit karne kii raah par chale hi the ki ain maukey par bhitari kalah ne unki sambhaavnaaon par pani pher diya
 Akhilesh's problem is that he has no alternative plan
 unhone khud ko jamini netaa ke taur par sthapit karne ke liye na to mehnat kii he or na hi party kaaryakartaaon ke sang samay hi bitaayaa he
 He still needs Mulayam to be recognized as the real heir, so he also needs the organizational skills of Shivpal to command the social engineering needed to return to power
 mulaayam chunki achaanak akhilesh se naaraaz ho gaye hai, to akhilesh ko yah baat akhar rahi he kyonki chaar saal se zyada samay mukhyamantri rahane ke baavjood party par unki koi pakad nahin he
 The same thing is now frightening them
 jis samay akhilesh bijepi, bispi or congress kii aage badhati phujon ko rokane ke liye khud ko taiyaar kar rahe the, thik usee dauraan unke apane parivaar ne unhen patkhni de di
 The Samajwadi Party will have to answer that is it not digging its grave by targeting Akhilesh? deshbhar main in dinon rohingya muslimon ke mudde par hangaamaa ho rahaa he
 The central government has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court saying that Rohingya refugees are not intruders and threaten the security of the country

 The comments khilaadiyon-adhikariyon ne kiya bich-bachaav Players and officials intervened faijabad ke ek chote se gaanv kusamah main april, 2013 main meri mulaakaat bhudukanath baba se hui
 Some 22-23-year-old Baba's court had hundreds of people standing with their heads bowed
 koi murgi to koi apni gaay unhen daan main de rahaa tha
 Baba had become the owner of hundreds of cows and chickens with donations from devotees
 ye sampatti unhone bamushkil ek hafte ke bheetar juta lee thi
 Go to the village of Faizabad, where the miracles of Bhukadnath were going on
 koi kahata baba ke sparsh se asaadhya bimaariyaan dur ho jaati hai
 Someone says Baba, who has a close look at his eyes, the misery of sorrows ends
 or to or, bhoot-pret kii baadha kaa ilaaj karne main to baba maahir the
 So i thought why not once we see the miracle of this magical Baba with our own eyes
 aath bai das ke kamare main 51 ghi ke deepak jalaae baithe baba ne ek dhoti se jaise-taise khud ko dhank rakhaa tha
 However, Baba's Bermuda and T-shirt were also hung in one corner of the room
 us kamare main khargosh or mor idhar-udhar daud laga rahe the
 People used to come there and Baba would give them something to drink and say, now you will not even be able to touch the shadow of sorrow
 bhakt bhavavihval ho jaataa or baba kaa jayakaara karte hue baahar chalaa jaataa
 My curiosity grew that what is there in this decoction that takes both mental and physical sufferings in a moment
 kaadhe ke avyavon ke bare main maine poocha
 Baba said, there are herbs of the Himalayas
 maine kaha kripaya un bootiyon ke naam bataa den jisase faijabad se dur anya jilon ke logon ko bhi iskaa laabh diya ja sake
 Baba stumbled and said that 'rare' herbs are not available to everyone
 baba ke bhakton ne mujhe chetaya agar or sawaal puche to parinaam bura hoga
 After two minutes of silence i asked Baba again, what will we do with so many chickens and cows? Baba said that we are collecting money
 lakhanu ke scooter nagar main shiv kaa ek mandir banvaanaa he
 wonderful! On one hand, the devotees had resolved to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya, on the other hand they were determined to build Bhuknath Shiv temple
 mere in sawaalon se na keval baba, balki bhakton kaa paara chadhataa ja rahaa tha
 i said sorry Baba, but why only Shiv temple? He told a very strange anecdote
 suniye, lakhanu main ek baar saanp ne mujhe kaat liya lekin tabhi ek gaay ne aakar mujhe chaat liya or main batch gaya
 Baba also showed a photo of this biting episode
 ab maine baari khatra uthaate hue poocha baba jab ye ghatana hui to us vakt camera kahaan se clic ho gaya
 i said a little nervous, Baba is just a curious curiosity
 baba ne kaha, mujhe raat main sapana aayaa tha so maine apane mitron ko ye khabar di thi
 Now the media people will know from there
 baahar nikali to logo se jaananaa chaha ki baba ke bare main unki jaankaree kya he? jisase pucho bas vah yahi kahata baba ke bare main kuch kah paane kii unki haisiyat nahin
 Only God knows who Baba is
 ishwar ne bas hamaare dukh harne ke liye baba ko bheja he
 People were offering money, animals, grains and even some piece of land at their feet without knowing Baba's background
 ek samay central upi main aise hi ‘nirmal baba’ ke chamatkaar ke kisse har doosraa vyakti sunaata tha
 Bhuduknath was famous at the state level or in some parts of the state, but Nirmal Baba's fame had spread to many states of North India
 nirmal baba kaa gungan karte hue koi kahata unke bete ne iity kii pariksha paas kar lee to koi kahata unki beti ne embibies nikaal liya
 If someone got a job, then his daughter got married to Baba's expectation
 or baba ke totake bhi jaraa suniye
 Green chutney with samosas
 dukaan main rakhi kaali purse kharidne kii salaah
 The interesting thing is that not only educated people were adopting these tricks
 asaram, ram rahim, radhe maa, satya sai baba samet anginat kisse aapako sunne ko mil jaaenge
 Does Baba really do miracles? The question arises whether such Baba is truly miraculous? The public will understand this
 gurukul kangri ke professor si
 p Khokhar explains
 '‘chamatkrit karne vaali kahaniyaan saamaanya logon ko aakarshith hi nahin karatin balki apekshaakrit ek aasaan suraksha kaa gheraa bhi uplabdh karaati hai
 "they say that just as they are soothed by the practice of deeds, in the same way, by listening to these miraculous stories repeatedly and not arguing on them, people become" foolish fools "
 ames main cycatri department main professor rajesh sagar bhi dow
 He agrees with Khokhar, he says, "this security circle is actually a personal world made of relaxed and positive thinking, or rather a virtual support system
" ’dow khokhar kehete hai, bas yahi bhramjaal andh bhakton kii bheed khadaa kar detaa he
 Because raising questions is not part of our culture! Dr
 Khokhar says, 'there is no concept of' self concept 'in our society
 ’sosayadi aane vaali jenereshan ko viraasat main keval bhautik chijen hi nahin transfar nahin karti balki kuch aisi chijen bhi transfar karti he jo hamaare bilive system ko viksit karti he
 Many beliefs inadvertently take root in us
 hamaare yahaan dharanaon kii taarkik vyakhya karne waalon ko hatotsahit kiya jaataa he
 That is, those who try to develop a self-concept, the society considers it an insult to the thinking of the elders
 iske ulat jo sosayadi jitna viksit hogi vahaan utana hi vyakti ko anubhav aadhaarit bilive system viksit karne ke liye prerit kiya jayega
 So how do highly educated people, big and big officials get involved in this confusion? Dr
 khokhar kehete hai ‘zyada padhai likhaai yaa phir sampannataa aapako andhvishwaason se aaazaad nahin karaati he
 i again say that as soon as the matter rises above the temporal, it is supernatural
 log dimag ke bheetar upajane vaale tarkon ko shaitani khuraafaat kaa nateeja maanate hai
 'asaram Bapu or Baba Ram Rahim or some other Baba, these people cheat and trick people by taking advantage of this lively system of society
 aisa dar samaaj main paidaa kar diya jaataa he ki tathakthith kisi chamatkaar kaa vishleshan karne ko ghor paap maan liya jaataa he
 Rajesh Sagar, a professor in the Psychiatry Department at AIIMS, also considers blind faith and faith to be a culture-related issue
 ve kehete hai ‘ham jis samaaj main ji rahe hote hai
 Almost the same system of thinking and understanding develops within us
 khaastaur par bhartiya sabhyataa main dharm kii bahut badi bhoomika rahi he
 We have been hearing words like God, miracles and related stories since childhood
 hamaare dimag kii training is tarah se hoti he ki hamen ishwar, aasthaa, dharm, paraloukik baton par sawaal uthaane se roka jaataa he
 The funny thing is that a rational person does not get to know that there is a corner in his mind that he is not controlling the perceptions of society and home
 ’ve aage kehete hai, ‘har vyakti ke bheetar ‘fier of isolation’ yani ye bhi dar baitha hota he ki agar usne aasthaa, shraddha jaise masalon par sawaal uthaae to use samaaj main alag-thalag kar diya jayega
 The possibility of evil makes our arguments blunt
 si
 P
 khokhar bhi kuch isi tarah kaa vishleshan kehete hai, ‘hamaare bheetar ek dar paidaa kiya jaataa he ki agar hamane tarkon kii kasuti main dharm yaa aasthaa ko kasne kii koshish kii to hamaara anisht ho jayega
 Our family and friends will have to burn in the fire of this evil
 isliye zyaadaatar maamalon main aasthaa ek dar ke rup main man ke kone main gahari or majboot jad jamaa leti he
 'becomes a strong Believe system
 bilkul vaise hi jaise ve hansate hue kehete hai, hamaare yahaan kahawat he na, ''karat-karat abhyaas se jadmati hot sujan, rasri aavat jaat sil par padat nishaan
 So by constantly practicing superstition and these beliefs, people become foolish people
 '' yani lagaataar lagaataar in dharmik dharanaon ko poshan karne se dimag ise sach maan letaa he
 And for those questioning, many arguments in favor of these assumptions begin to form
 professor rajesh kehete hai, 'dar' or 'asuraksha' kii bhaavana hamen aasthaa ke andhe kuen main phenk detii hai
 Where to get out is difficult
 yahi vajah hoti he ki jab kisi dharm guru yaa baba kaa pardaafash hota he to uske bhakt or jor-jor se chillaate hai
 Actually, that devotee is trying more to save a false support system designed for himself than Baba
 kyonki jab kisi mashhoor baba ko police, prashasan ke saamne uske bhakt laachaar dekhte hai to unhen apana astitv dagamagaataa sa lagata he
 Dr
 si
 P
 khokhar kehete hai, hamaari sosayadi aisi he jahaan bado ke saamne sawaal uthaanaa galat mana jaataa he
 Arguing parents' decisions is misunderstood
 aise main jab ye kaha jaataa he ki dharm or ishwar or inke tathakthith swaghoshit agenton kaa darja to maa-baap se bhi upar he
 In such a situation, then questioning these issues will be considered as crime-e-azim! Will this imaginary world of miracles ever break? But can this native system be broken? Dr
 khokhar kehete hai, ye system saalon yaa kahen sadiyon ke baad bana he
 This Believe system has traversed the subconscious mind of many generations
 is bilive system ko banane main itnaa vakt laga he to tuutane main bhi vakt lagegaa or mehnat bhi
 The question arises whether the society will have to be more alert now? Will not only the administration but the society also have to launch a campaign against the hypocritical babes wearing saintly garments? Because Dr
 si
 P
 khokhar ke mutabik sadiyon se bane is bilive system ko todane vakt to lagegaa hi saath hi khaasi mashkkat bhi
 We also have to come out of the false security circle that Dr
 rajesh sagar ne kiya he
 Faith and religion have to be tested on the basis of arguments

 Therefore, it is not necessary to answer any of their lies, neither is it fair nor emergency
 varna ham kal hi de dete
 We say that if the Congress party also supported BJP yesterday
 to vah bijepi ko samarthan nahin tha
 He, like us, was criticizing Somnath Bharti's indecisive conduct and demanding his dismissal
 ambani sahab ko koun phayda pahunchaana chahta he, ye aaj saaf ho gaya
 We saw that at first, Kejriwal ji told the company of Ambani ji, on one side, people would reduce the price of electricity

 maine hi sadan main vah pesh kiya tha
 If our party was anti-jan Lokpal bill, then our party's CM Khanduri in Uttarakhand would not have introduced it in the country first
 agar hamaari party janalokapal bill ke paksh main na hoti, to loksabhaa main bane is kanoon ko hamaari party kaa vyapak samarthan na miltaa
 Mr

 Jaitley Ji, everyone supported it
 hamane pehle bhi kaha tha
 Said even today
 kanoon banane ke liye kanoon kaa, samvidhan kaa apmaan, ham kisi bhi keemat par bardaasht nahin karenge
 Today the Honorable Lieutenant Governor of Delhi gave a clear message in the Assembly that if the Jan Lokpal Bill is to be brought, then the legal process has to be completed
 meraa kejariwal ji ko suzav he ki agar vah mukhyamantri rahane vaale hai
 i don't know if he is going to stay or not
 unhone kaha tha ki janalokapal bill paas nahin hua, to vah istipha denge
 i want to tell him that if he will bring the Jan Lokpal bill to the House with all constitutional procedures
 ham bijepi ke vidhayak unki party se zyada takat ke saath use dilli kaa kanoon banaaenge
 Now after a few hours, try not to lie to the people of Delhi and the country
 vah ek jhooth bolenge to ham unke das jhooth ujagar karenge
