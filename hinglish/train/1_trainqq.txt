 And exactly 15 days later the news came that Furkan was killed in the Kipolis encounter
 police kaa farjivada?haalanki police kaa daawa tha ki phurkan saharanpur, shamali or muzaffarnagar main kai dakaitiyon main shaamil tha

 This letter is not meant to show any address or even to know your well being

 Now you must be thinking why apology? i am going away from you with a heavy heart, i can no longer accept you socially
 ye to meraa dil hi jaanata he ki meraa or tumhaara prem amar he, lekin main saamaajik daayaron main bandhaa manushya hum
 This society is not letting me love you anymore
 log kehane lage hai ki raajnneeti ab gandi ho gai he
 
 
 
 dekho ganda hona koi paap nahin he, haa, basharte tum agar ganga main nahaane ke vakt alag- alag angel vaale camere nahin le gai hoti to mujhapar samaaj kaa dabaav nahin aata
 Now if it is a matter of one occasion, then i should also make him come and go, but the same thing happens with you every day that you are getting dirty day by day
 ab bataao bhala sena ke jawan to mere mata-pita tulya hai, bhai tulya hai, lekin tumne unhen bhi nahin choda, sirf chand logon ko apni ore aakarshith karne ke liye tumne unki jabanji ko desi lowki kii tarah kadaahi main pakaane kii koshish kii

 meri priy raajnneeti, tum pehle aisi nahin thi! 50 se 80 ke dashak tak to tumhaari eemaandaaree or khuddari ke anginat kisse hai, inhen ko padhakar to main tumse prem main pad gaya tha
 i started to like you so much that i always wanted to keep myself around you, when you returned home at night, you had stories, people started thinking of me as someone who chanted the name of Laila day and night
 Used to live ab dekho samaaj tumhaare bare main kya- kya kehane laga he?sach kahuun to main bhala aam aadmi kisi aam kii tarah chus kar kahi bhi phenk diya jaaoongaa, lekin tumhaari praasangikta kabhi kam nahin hogi

 Now look, i too am patient and writing the love letter of this breakup
 dekho, tumse dur jane kaa dil nahin tha lekin ab main karun to kya karun, tumhaari khatir hi to bihar main vikaas purush ke naam se jane jane vaale ek shikhar purush ne brallep or phir packp kaa anoothaa daur shuru kar rakhaa he
 This has put your credibility in danger and it has become very difficult to believe you
 dekho koi ek martabaa ho to shikawa-gilaa kar is jhijak ko dur karata, lekin dilli main bhi ek raja babu aise hai jinhone you turn maarane ke aise record banaae hai, jisase bahutayat logon kaa dil tut gaya
 Now look, there is no radar in my heart that can be deceived by the clouds of love like your antelope
 main vakt rahete khud ko tumse dur isliye karnaa chahta hum, taaki mujh aam aadmi kaa murabba koi doosraa munva banaakar naa kha sake
 Oh my dear politics, i used to love you, do it and will keep doing it, but like i told you earlier, i am a common man working 10 to 7 daily in a poor bus, who never snatches a mobile
 If it is taken, sometimes someone kills the purse
 
 
 aise main samaaj ke bich rahakar tumhaara meraa prem amar to ho saktaa he, lekin saath basar nahin ho saktaa, isliye ab is sambandh par aaj se mitti daalane kii mai shuruyaat kar rahaa hum

 a special program was going on in the country of South America on the occasion of completion of 81 years of National Guard
 raashtrapati apane desh ke suraksha gards kaa hausala badhaane ke liye joshila bhaashan de rahe the
 Then suddenly something flying from the sky comes close to the President
 phir isse pehle ki koi kuch samaj pataa achaanak hawa main hi ek zordaar dhamaakaa hota he
 There is chaos on the spot as soon as the explosion takes place
 raashtrapati ke suraksha guard fouran eashtrapati ko apane ghere main le lete hai
 But what happened in the air? This is revealed when bullet-proof armor is removed from the front of the President
 4 agast 2018, shaam 5:41 baje, caracas, venezuelarajdhani caracas main neshnal guard ke 81 saal puure hone par ek samaaroh yojit kiya gaya tha
 As the chief guest, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro himself arrived to encourage the National Guards
 rashtriya channel par is bhavy samaaroh kaa sidhaa prasaaran kiya ja rahaa tha
 The entire nation's eyes were on the President's speech as the country has been getting worse from last one year and President Nicholas had to answer all the allegations against him
 gale main golden chen or tirangaa pahane hue raashtrapati joshila bhaashan de rahe the
 Then suddenly there was a blast in the sky just above the President
 raashtrapati par drone se hamalaa!neshnal gards ne halaat ko sambhaal liya
 The bodyguards made a human shield in front of the president
 or duusari taraf jis path par parade chal rahi thi vahaan se hazaron kii taadaad main gards bhaagane lage
 The escape of the guards is not considered good in the army
 lihaaza rashtriya channel ne fouran sidhaa prasaaran roak diya
 The question was that what happened in the beginning whose blast sound was heard but nothing was seen
 yaa asal main samaj main hi nahin aayaa ki aakhir hua kya
 This attack was done for the purpose of targeting the President and it was not understood because it was done with something flying in the air
 jo ki ek drone tha
 First Drone Attack on Head of State: It was the world's first drone attack on a Head of State
 raashtrapati nicholas par visphotak bhare drone se hamalaa kiya gaya
 It is considered to be the largest political attack in Venezuela ever
 bhaashan dete hue abhi kuch der hi hui thi
 That the sound of the explosion scared everyone
 dhamaake se camera hill gaya or sena kii parade kii taraf dekh rahe sabhi mehmaanon kii nazar aasmaan kii taraf atak gai
 No one understood what appeared in the sky
 bas ek jagah par kaala dhuna uthta hua dikhaai diya
 The President was escorted by bodyguards, the National Guards opened the bullet proof cover and stood in front of the President so that he would not suffer any harm
 magar naa to gards ko samaj aa rahaa he or naa hi raashtrapati nicholas ko ki hamalaa kis taraf se hua he or bachanaa kidar se he
 So they were covered from all sides
 dar ye tha ki kahin koi hamalavar dhamaake kaa phayda uthaakar saamne se goliyaan naa chalaane lage
 a similar furore was seen in the second picture of the firecrackers in the buildings after the blast, when the soldiers, who were all over the audience, ran away after hearing the blast
 jis jagah drone dhamaakaa hua, vahaan aasapaas kii building main aag lag gai
 The windows of the windows were broken due to the explosion
 raashtrapati ko fouran neshnal gards ke jawan samaaroh sthal se mahfuz jagah par le gaye
 7 soldiers injured, 6 suspects arrested
 7 soldiers have been injured in this attack on President Nicholas
 magar abhi tak ye saaf nahin ho paaya he ki hamalaa kisne kiya
 It is only stated that the drone was loaded with explosives and it was being operated with remote control
 baharhaal is drone hamale ke maamle main chah logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Several vehicles have been confiscated, while several hotels have also been raided in the capital, Caracas
 saath hi, aage kai or giraftaaryaan bhi ho sakati hai
 Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has accused the extremist groups and outgoing Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos of accusing them of attacking extremist groups
 nicholas ne kaha "meri hatya karne ke makasad se hamalaa kiya gaya he
 i have no doubt that all aspects related to this attack show that Venezuela and Colombian right forces and Colombian President Khuan Manuel Santos are behind it
 "vipaksh ne bataaya- raashtrapati kaa stantaaalanki venezuela kii vipakshi partiyon kaa kahana he ki ye raashtrapati kaa stant he, jo apni naakamayaabi ko is tarah chupaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 And want to gain sympathy
 aapako bataa den ki venezuela philhal apane sabase kharaab daur se guzar rahaa he
 The government seems to be failing in every matter from economy to social security
 jisaki vajah se khud desh ke andar kai vidrohi sanghathan raashtrapati ke khilaaf khadey ho gaye hai
 It is possible that they have a hand behind this attack
 pichley saal bhi hua tha hamalaek khabar ke mutabik hamale kii jimmedaari neshnal movement of solgers in tishart naam ke ek sanghathan ne lee he
 But no such evidence was found by the security agencies
 ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki isamen videshi takaton kaa haath ho saktaa he
 Let us tell you that earlier in June 2017, bombs were dropped from a helicopter on the Supreme Court of Venezuela
 helicopter ke payalat auskar perej ne venezuela ke nagarikon se maduro ke khilaaf khadey hone kii apil kii thi
 Who was later killed

 Assam's victory and good performance in 4 states have brought smiles on the faces of BJP leaders and activists who went missing after defeats in Bihar and Delhi
 ab jashn jeet kaa bhi he or centre main narendra modi sarkaar ke 2 saal puure hone kaa bhi
 But BJP President Amit Shah, who is reviewing these results, is still facing future questions
 unki pehali press vaarta main baar-baar agar koi sawaal unhen gher rahaa tha to ye ki ab uttar pradesh main party kii ranneeti kya hogi, kya mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa party degi? amit shah kaa jawaab ek hi tha kii vaqt aane par tay hoga
 Behind Amit Shah's official reply, a streak of concern can be seen which gets deep in the name of Uttar Pradesh elections on the face of every leader of the party
 wo party jisane modi lahar main pradesh kii record 72 siten jiti ab vidhansabha chunaav ke liye us formule kii talash main he jo mayawati or samaajawaadee party ko maat de sake
 Asam's victory brought the face of the party chief minister ahead of the election has brought many lessons for the party
 dilli main mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa chunaav se pehle saamne laane kaa nuksaan party ko hua or usne bihar main modi or amit shah ke chehre par hi chunaav lard daalaa, nateeja sabake saamne he
 Considering the local unit in Assam, the advantage of making the most favorite face Sarbananda Sonowalco candidate was recorded in the party's historic victory
 assam se sikh lekar bijepi ne abhi se upi main party ke chehre ko talashna shuru kar diya he
 The party is looking for a leader who can compete with Behenji, ie Mayawati, and can also establish caste equations
 smriti irani, mahesh sharma, yogi adityanath ko jimmevary dena is ranneeti kaa hissaa hi he
 Do not ignore the local leaders Hoparty is working on a strategy to pay attention to the local leaders in UP
 party pradesh adhyaksh keshav prasad maury ne jila adhyakshon kii ghoshnaa main is baat par puraa jor diya he
 In every district, on the basis of caste, such leaders were chosen who have been engaged in the work of the party for years
 yahi nahin, varisht netaa kalyaan singh or rajnath singh ke karibiyon ko bhi jagah di gai taaki gutbaji par lagaam kasi ja sake
 Message from Assam: Change in style of campaigning: In this party the party put forward local issues
 bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon ke khilaaf bayaanbaji hui magar ye dhyaan rakhaa gaya ki dhruvikaran na ho sake
 The BJP continued to distinguish Bangladeshi Muslims from Indian Muslims
 party kii koshish rahegi kii upi main is sikh ko apanaaya jaae
 Along with the slogan of Mandal Kamandal, the development and functioning of the center should be made known among the public
 ye sanket amit shah ne dene shuru bhi kar die hai
 Like in Assam, the party will have to rein in internal factionalism
 sarbanand sonoval or hemanth biswa sarama ke aapasi matbhed kisi se chhipe nahin lekin rajya main ranneeti is hisaab se banaai gai ki donon kii mahatvakanksha party par baari naa pade
 If, in Uttar Pradesh too, like Amit Shah, can overcome this sadness of the party in the assembly like in the Lok Sabha elections, then the iron of his political doctor will probably start to be considered as hostile
 deepika padukon or ranvir singh kii shahi shaadi kaa samaaroh 14-15 november ko italy ke lake komo main hone ja rahaa he

 aasaraam baapu to yaad honge? ji haa, vahi asaram baapu jo pichley sava saal se zyada vakt se jail ke andar hai
 In the charge of sexual abuse
 baap ke peeche-peeche baad main bete narayan sai ko bhi isi tarah ke iljaam main jail le jaaya gaya
 The news is that since the duo went to jail, a total of six people have been killed so far, who are connected in some way to these father-son cases
 inamen se do kaa to katl hi kar diya gaya
 And the second murder took place on this Sunday
 amritbhai gulabchand prajapati, raju chandok, surat kii peedit bahanon main se ek (narayan sai kii purv anuyaayi) or akhil gupta in sabhi ke sabhi kirdaaron ke saath teen baaten behad ajeeb hai
 Firstly, they have been close to the so-called saint Asaram Bapu or his son Narayan Sai, surrounded by all the rapes and accusations of hypocrisy
 doosraa ye ki badalte vakt ke saath in sabhi ne asaram or unke bete narayan sai ke khilaaf sach bolne kii himmat jutai he or teesraa ye ki in chaar main se do ko gumnaam qaatilon ne maut ke ghat utaar diya he or baaki do khud par hue jaanaleva hamale main bal-bal bache hai
 Akhil Gupta, a resident of Muzaffarnagar, was once very close to Asaram and especially his son Narayan Sai
 wo naa sirf baap-bete ke liye rasoie kaa kaam karata tha balki unki tamaam jaruraton kaa bhi khyaal rakhata tha
 In this connection, he also lived in his Ahmedabad ashram for about ten years, but later after marrying a girl there, he returned to his home Muzaffarnagar
 iske baad wo yaheen rah kar deyari kaa kaarobaar kar rahaa tha, lekin ravivaar kii raat kareeb paune aath baje jab wo scooter par apane ghar laut rahaa tha
 Suddenly some attackers on the bike shot him from behind and took advantage of the darkness and escaped
 baad main akhil ko aspataal le jaaya gaya, lekin tab tak uski maut ho chuki thi
 In fact, Akhil had been accused of rape with Asaram and Narayan Sai after complaining to two sisters from Surat, because in those days, Akhil also allegedly supported him in the father-son act
 mujffanagar main asaram ke rasoiyaa rahe akhil ko bike par aae do logon ne apni goli kaa nishaanaa banaaya or andhere main gum ho gaye
 
 
 In the same way as Amritbhai Prajapati, who was Vaidya of Asaram last year, two people came to Rajkot's clinic and targeted the bullets
 
 
 to kya, asaram ke khilaaf munh kholanewaale in donon gavaahon ke qatl kaa bilkul ek jaisaa ye tarika bhi mahaz ittefaq he? yaa phir ishaara kuch or he?asaram kaa purv vaidya, sevadaar or raazdarji haa, ye wo shaks tha jisane dharm ke aabhamandal se jite-ji bhagwaan ban chuke asaram ke chehre se pehali baar sharafat kaa naqaab noch phenkaa tha
 It is a matter of fact that Prajapati has told the world for the first time how Asaram was running a shop of hypocrisy in the name of Bapu Dharma and how he was teaching Brahmacharya to others, but not one in his own ashram Was building relationships with girls and women
 faqat paakhand kii badaulat lakhon logon ke dilon dimag par raaj karanevaale kisi shaks ke khilaaf yun morcha kholana koi aasaan baat nahin thi
 So, as soon as Prajapati opened his mouth, a series of attempts to intimidate him started but Prajapati was neither going to stop nor stopped, but he destroyed the secrets of Asaram that no one could think of
 asaram kii isi asaliyat se waakif hone ke baad prajapati ne unka saath chhod diya or unke khilaaf darj kai maamalon main gavaah ban chuke the
 But unfortunately, one day he was the one who was afraid
 prajapati ko rajkot ke unke clinics main marij ban kar aae do gunahagaaron ne najadik se goli maar di or aspataal main puure 19 din tak maut se do-do haath kare ke baad unki jaan chali gai
 After being accused of sexually abusing a 16-year-old innocent, Asaram's stars went to such an extent that they never lighted up again
 ek wo din he or ek aaj kaa din, asaram jail se baahar aane kaa har jatan kar chuke hai
 Every argument has been made, every complaint has been heard, but for the court and the law, all of them proved to be meaningless and vain
 haal hi main asaram ne apni beemaari ko hathiyaar banaakar khuli hawa main saans lene kii koshish kii
 But sadly, this attempt also went in vain

 isse pehle jab bhi arvind kejariwal press conference karte the to yaa to dilli sachivalay main yaa phir civil lines ke apane sarkari nivas par kiya karte the
 The Aam Aadmi Party shifted its headquarters to the existing site in January 2016, which was actually a residence for a cabinet minister in the Delhi government
 yahaan par mukhyalay shift hone ke baad arvind kejariwal ek-do baar yahaan aae to zarur lekin kabhi press ko sambodhit nahin kiya
 Party sources are telling that now the party's headquarters will be the center of all the strategy for the Lok Sabha elections
 aam dinon main varisht netaa yahaan press ko sambodhit karne ke liye yaa kisi khaas baithak ke liye hi aayaa karte the lekin loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan party mukhyalay main niyamit rup se varisht netaaon kii tainaati kii jaaegi jo kisi bhi samay party netaaon, ummidavaaron yaa kaaryakartaaon kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan karenge
 They will also answer media questions
 mana ja rahaa he ki arvind kejariwal kaa party mukhyalay se press conference karnaa puri party ko sandesh hoga ki ab yahaan zyaada se zyaada bitaayen or party ke liye puri taaqat lagaaein

 Hazare, who arrived in Delhi from Pune to attend the Lokpal Drafting Joint Committee meeting to be held on Wednesday, said that the members of the society and the government are no different
 donon ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 If the two work together for an issue like Lokpal, then there should be no problem in this

 Questions can be answered only by discussion
 matbhed apni jagah hai lekin charchaa bhi ek vikalp he
 Significantly, the Hazare side boycotted the last meeting of the Lokpal Drafting Committee on June 6 to protest against the police action on Ramlila ground during Baba Ramdev's fast and the government's stand to tackle corruption
 isse pehle, 30 may ko hui baithak main sarkaar or hazaare paksh ke bich gambhir matbhed ubhare the
 Hazare, however, warned the government that if she takes the public lightly, then she will also be responsible for the results

 Hazare said, "I have been facing similar allegations for 20 years
 mujhe lagata he ki raashtra or samaaj ke liye apmaan ko bardaasht karnaa aana chaiye
 "he said without naming the Congress or its leaders," what is being said against me is being said deliberately

 When the country became a republic on 26 January 1950, then the general public became the owner of this country

 Regarding the question being raised recently on his letter to Congress President Sonia Gandhi, he said, "I have not made any mistake by writing a letter
" maine apane anubhavon ke aadhaar par hi patr likhaa he
 Earlier, in a conversation with reporters, when Hazare was asked if he considered the BJP to be a corrupt party as well, the Gandhian leader said, "why should i say anything about it?" desh kii janata behatar jaanati he
 On Mukherjee's statement, he said, "we do not deny that Parliament is supreme
" lekin sansad sirf dilli main nahin he
 The gram sabhas are larger than the Parliament of Delhi

 There is a deadlock between the Hazare party and the government over the issue of bringing the corrupt conduct of mps within the Prime Minister, the High Judiciary and Parliament under the scrutiny of the proposed Lokpal

 The BJP has got more than 80 lakh votes in the Lok Sabha and elections of these bodies and panchayats will clear the Congress in Rajasthan and the foundation of Congress-free Rajasthan will be in Rajasthan
 'duusari taraf congress kigalot sarkaarka maananaa he ki toll tex se pradesh kii sarkaar ko rajasav milegaa

 The BJP has also taken a dig at the Gehlot government by saying that Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is doing this because the Department of Public Works is under the charge of Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot and that is why the Gehlot government has done this to tarnish the pilot's image in public The decision is taken

 'aage unhone kaha, 'bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar main ki unase toll vasuul nahin kiya jayega
 This does not mean that we waived the entire toll
 jo maal dhone kii gaadiyaan hai, jo trek he un par yadi toll lagata he, to koi dikkat nahin he
 If there is a toll on private vehicles on the national highway, then certainly they will be asked to give relief to them and demand that their toll be waived

 This is the third time they have reached the league finals
 star redar pradeep narwal kii team ne qualifire-2 main guuruuvaar ko khele gaye match main bengal warirs ko maat dekar khitaabi mukaable main kadam rakhaa
 At the same time, Gujarat entered the finals by defeating Bengal in Qualifier-1
 pro-kabddi ne navy ke is hawaldaar ko karodpati banane ke kareeb pahunchayadonon hi timen damdaar hai
 Both Patna and Gujarat have excellent raiders
 gujarat haalanki lig main ek majboot team ke rup main ubharkar ai
 His raiding has been superb on the strength of players like captain Sukesh Hegde, Mahendra Rajput and Sachin Tanwar, but Abojar, Fazel Atracheli and Parvesh Banswal have been impossible for the other 11 teams to break their strong defenses this season
 in teenon ne gujarat ke dephence ko is sijan kaa majboot dephence sabit kiya he
 Gujarat and Patna have clashed twice in the most expensive player of pro-kabaddi season-5 (2017)
 donon hi baar sukesh kii team ne patna ko maat di he
 On September 29, Gujarat defeated Patna 30–29 in the Interjonal Week Challenge, while on October 8, in the Interjonal Wild Card Week, Sukesh's team won 33–29 against Pradeep's team
 gujarat ke coach manpreet singh bhi final mukaable ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar hai
 He once said that he would not let Pradeep beat Super-10 in any match against Patna in the league and this happened
 patna kii baat kii jaae, to uske paas 'dubkee king' pradeep or monu goyat ke rup main do behtareen redar hai, lekin uskaa dephence kamjor he, jiskaa phayda gujarat ko mil saktaa he
 Captain Pradeep himself has admitted to the weak defense of the team
 unhone kaha, 'meri team main rading kii jimmedaari main or monu goyat mukhya rup se sanbhaalenge, lekin hamen apane kamjor dephence ko behatar karnaa hoga
 ' 'khamosh' aisa kehane vaale actor se netaa bane shatrughna sinha 16veen loksabhaa main puri tarah se khamosh rahe
 In the last five years, he has not asked a single question in the Lok Sabha nor participated in any discussion
 itnaa hi nahin, unhone is dauraan sadan ke patal par koi privet member bill bhi nahin rakhaa
 However, he made a record in terms of spending from MP fund
 beete 5 varshon main saansad nidhi kharch karne ke maamle main shatrughna sinha baaki saansadon se kahin aage hai
 Shatrughan Sinha is an MP from Patna Sahib in Bihar
 unhone bijepi ke tikat par patna sahib se duusari baar saal 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav jeeta tha
 Now he is planning to leave the Bharatiya Janata Party and join the Congress Party
 saal 2014 se lekar 2019 tak loksabhaa main shatrughna sinha ne bhale hi ek bhi sawaal nahin poocha ho, lekin sadan se baahar apni puraani party bijepi or pradhanmantri narendra modi se sawaal karte rahe
 By asking questions in the Lok Sabha, mps take stock of the development work in their parliamentary constituency
 saath hi is baat ko lekar sawaal uthaate hai ki unke ilaake main sarkaar kii ore chalaai ja raheen tamaam yojanaon main se unke sansadeey kshetra main koun si yojana kaa laabh pahunchaa or koun si yojana kaa laabh nahin pahunchaa
 Through this, the mps also indicate the accountability of the government
 kisi bhi saansad dwaara koi sawaal poocha jaataa he yaa charchaa ke dauraan jo baat kahi jaati he, vah loksabhaa kii kaarywahi main darj hoti he
 Asking questions and joining the discussion shows how concerned the local MP is about his area
 iske alaava saansad 60 privet member bill pesh kar sakate hai
 At the same time, in the 16th Lok Sabha, Supriya Sule of NCP asked one thousand 181 questions, Dharmendra Yadav of Samajwadi Party asked one thousand 25 questions and Rajiv Satav of Congress asked one thousand 115 questions
 loksabhaa main nae navele saansad nahin hai shatrughna sinhapichley paanch saal se loksabhaa main ek bhi sawaal nahin poochne kaa record banane vaale shatrughna sinha pehali baar saansad nahin bane hai
 He is not the newly elected MP in the House, but has been elected to the Lok Sabha MP for the second time
 isse pehle wo do baar saal 1996 se lekar 2008 tak rajyasabha saansad rah chuke hai
 Not only this, he has been the Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare and the Union Minister of Shipping in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government
 bijepi ne shatrughna sinha kaa tikat katashatrughna sinha kai maukon par pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah samet party ke netritv par hamalaa bolte najar aae hai
 He was also in the news for the attack on the BJP leadership
 saarvajanik rup se bijepi netritv par hamalaa bolne ke chalate party ne is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main unka tikat bhi kaat diya he
 This time the Bharatiya Janata Party has fielded Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad from Shatrughan Sinha's Patna Sahib seat

 The court ordered that within six weeks the government should submit its draft plan to RT, which would also keep track of the number and timing of the fast track court so that the case against any tainted public representative can be settled within a year
 aapako bataa den ki abhi haal hi main ai ediaar ne 4852 vidhayakon or saansadon ke halafname kaa adhyayan karne ke baad yah report prakashit kii thi
 In which there were many revelations about tainted leaders

 In the fifth convocation of the National Sanskrit Sansthan, Irani said, if we want to make Sanskrit the language of the people, then easy Sanskrit should be promoted
 unhone kaha ki sanskrit kii shiksha aadhunik jaruraton ke anusaar badalani chahie or ise badhaava dene ke liye aadhunik technology kaa prayog kiya janaa chahie
 Smriti said that the courses should also be improved
 agle das varshon main sanskrit ke liye apane drushtikon ke bare main kendriya mantri ne kaha, prayek rajya ko is kshetra main kam se kam do-teen vidwaan taiyaar karne chahie
 input language loksabhaa main naagarikta sanshodhan bill (citizenship Amendment Bill) paas hone ke baad yah bill rajyasabha (rajya Sabha) main bhi pesh ho gaya he
 The Lok Sabha (lok Sabha) polled 311 in favor of the bill, while 80 votes were opposed
 loksabhaa main bill ke paas hone ke baad se hi is logon ke riection aane shuru ho gaye the
 Even many Bollywood actors opposed the citizenship amendment bill
 haal hi main is bill par bollywood actor adil hossain ne twit kiya he, jisane dekhte hi dekhte khub surkhiyaan batori hai
 Regarding this bill, Adil Hussain said that he is very worried because of the Citizenship Amendment Bill and NRC
 In All THESE chaos of NRC and CAB, # citizenshipamendmentbill i am most concern and deeply saddened that the fundamental "identity" of ours as human is massacred
 In this fight no body will win
 Everybody will loose
 The greatest loss of our times will be humanity itself
 adil hossain (adil Hussain) ne apane twit main enarasi (NRC) or naagarikta sanshodhan bill (citizenship Amendment Bill) ko lekar kaha, "enarasi or naagarikta sanshodhan bill kii araajaktaa ke bich main sabase zyada dukhi or chintit hum kyonki ek insaan ke taur par hamaari moulik pahchaan khatm kii ja rahi he
 Nobody will win in this battle
 har koi haaregaa
 The biggest loss of our life will be of humanity
 " iske alaava adil hossain ne ek or twit kiya, jisamen unhone kaha ki agar hamaari praathmik pahchaan hi khatm ho jaaegi to muslim, hindu, asmi or bengali kaa prayog karke ham kya kar lenge
 When we were born, our families had cheered because our mothers had given birth to a Human & not a squirrel! We were born a human FIRST
 If we cannot retain, protect & celebrate the PRIMARY identity than what's the USE of calling ourselves a Muslim, Hindu, Assamese or a Bengali?adil hossain (adil Hussain) ne kaha, "jab ham paidaa hue the, to hamaara parivaar khush hua tha kyonki hamaari maa ne ek insaan ko janm diya tha, kisi gilahari ko nahin
 We are born first as a human being
 agar ham ise apni praathmik pahchaan ke taur par dhaaran nahin kar sakate, bachaa nahin sakate or ise manaa nahin sakate to khud ko muslim, hindu, asmi or bengali bulaane kaa kya phayda hoga?" vahiin naagarikta sanshodhan bill kii baat karen to grih mantri amit shah (amit Shah) ne isapar kaha tha ki yah bill sharnaarthiyon ko naagarikta dene kaa kaam karegaa
 He said that this bill is not non-constitutional in any way nor does it violate article-14

 Four PDP mlas have given statements against the party
 PDP vidhayak abdul majid paddar kaa kahana he ki vah party se khush nahin hai or anya vidhayakon ko bhi sarkaar banane kii koshishen talashni chahie
 Before him, Imran Ansar, Abid Ansari, Abbas Ahmed have also spoken about their displeasure with the party
 darasal, is sugabugahat ke peeche rajya ke prabharee ram madhav dwaara 27 june ko kiya gaya ek twit he
 In a photo posted through this tweet, Ram Madhav is seen discussing the state roadmap with Sajjad Lone, a minister in the previous government in Srinagar

 This time, the terrorist is hovering on the journey
 koi bhi nahin chahta ki is yatra main kisi bhi tareeke kaa khalal pade
 In such a situation, it is believed that the BJP is brainstorming on every possibility to form a government and will try to implement it after the Amarnath Yatra is over

 com / 2bvfvqigol— Ram Madhav (@rammadhavbjp) June 27, 2018 Two-and-a-half-year tenure after 'breakup' has given rise to discussions about the formation of a new government in the state
 darasal pidipi-bijepi ke ‘brallep’ ke baad sarkaar ke dhai saal kaa kaarykaal bachaa hua he
 For so long, no political party wants to stay away from power despite the possibility of government formation
 lone se ram madhav kii mulaakaat bayaan kar rahi kahanelon ne 2009 main baraamula se loksabhaa chunaav ladaa tha, lekin isamen unhen haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 After this, Lone, who won the assembly elections from Handwara in 2014, was given the position of minister at the behest of the Center
 iske baad se lone modi ke mureed ho gaye
 Lone was advocating new politics by liberating Kashmir from the Mufti and Abdullah families during the campaign in 2014
 lone kashmir main nai leadership chaahate the
 Even PM Modi has appealed to the people of Kashmir several times during the campaign to end the monopoly of the father-son and father-daughter government
 lekin chunaav baad kisi bhi dal ko spasht bahumat nahin milane par bijepi ne pidipi se dosti karte hue sarkaar banaai, jisaki kaaphi aalochana hui
 The 19 'magic figure' for the BJP is the current political arithmetic of power in the state that no party can form a government without any cooperation
 rajya main 28 vidhayakon ke saath pidipi sabase badi party he
 At the same time, BJP is second with 25 mlas
 sarkaar banane ke liye jis ‘magic figar’ kii jarurat he, wo he 44
 That is, if BJP tries to form a government then it will need 19 mlas
 naaraaz vidhayakon main dikh rahi ‘sambhaavnaaen’neshnal conference ke paas 15 vidhayak to hai, lekin umr abdulla sarkaar girane vaale din hi saaf kar chuke hai ki ve rajya main jod-tod kii sarkaar banane kii bajaae phir nae sire se chunaav chaahate hai
 At the same time, the Congress with 12 mlas tried, but the matter did not work out
 aise main 19 vidhayakon kii jarurat ke liye bijepi sajaad lone kii pipuls party ke do vidhayak or anya nirdaleey vidhayakon ke saath-saath pidipi or neshnal conference ke naaraaz vidhayakon main sambhaavnaaen dekh rahi he
 The state has one CPM, one PDF and three independent mlas
 pidipi ke teen baagi vidhayak aasaan karenge rastapidipi ke teen vidhayak imraj raja ansaari, aabid ansaari or mohammad abbaas vaani to khulkar mahabuuba mufti kii khilaafat kar chuke hai
 Apart from these, 15 more mlas are also said to be angry with the party chief
 naaraaz vidhayakon ko uttari kashmir ke patan se vidhayak imran raja ansaari ekajute kar bijepi kii raah or aasaan kar rahe hai
 Ansari attacked Mehbooba accusing her of promoting familism

 Significantly, Haseeb Drabu played an important role in forming the BJP-PDP coalition government along with Ram Madhav

 'salaam cricket-2019'- landan main ravivaar ko 'ajtak' ke is khaas conklev ke seshan 'jab-jab jeeta hindustan' main pakistan ke purv captain misbah ul haq ne team india ke purv captain mahendra singh dhoni kii tarif kii he
 Misbah said that Dhoni has a major contribution to change in Indian cricket
 haalanki dravid or ganguli ne bhi acha kiya, lekin dhoni ke aane se team ne jo paaya wo badi baat he
 At Lord's on Sunday, Bhajji said that Dhoni is the best captain in world cricket after Ganguly
 kaha jaataa he ki captain ko do kadam aage hona chahie, lekin dhoni 10 kadam aage hai
 Misbah named Sachin Tendulkar as his favorite Indian cricketer
 bhajji ne kaha ki pakistan main mere bahut fevorett rahe hai
 He said that Wasim Akram has been my favorite
 saath hi unhone kaha ki injamaam ul haq sabase khatarnaak ballebaaj hai, jinhen gendbaaji karne main mujhe bahut dikkat hui
 Bhajji described Rohit Sharma and Warner as the best opener in the World Cup 2019
 bhajji ne kohli ko number teen ke liye chunaa
 Apart from this, when it came to bowlers, Bhajji chose Jaspreet Bumrah, Kagiso Rabada as the fast bowler
 bhartiya of spinner harbhajan singh ne pakistani khilaadi babar ajam kii jamkar tarif kii
 Misbah said that Virat Kohli is the biggest player
 unki match jeetne kii bhukh laajabaav he
 They are very positive
 unke alaava rohit or dhoni hai
 Apart from this, India's bowling is very strong
 harbhajan ne kaha ki 2019 world cap main bharat or pakistan match se pehle dabaav bharat par dabaav zyada hoga, kyonki jo pahalwaan damdaar hota he uske jehan main yah baat hoti he ki kahin haar na jaaen
 The second thing is that there will be pressure on Team India because then the reactions in the country are different
 pakistan ke paas khone ke liye kuch bhi nahin he, agar wo jeet jaati he to uske liye bonus hoga, lekin bharat harata he to wo bharat ke liye bahut kharaab baat hogi
 On political tension, Harbhajan Singh said that whenever we meet the players of Pakistan, we never feel that there has been any change
 ham agar inhen janmdin kii shubhakamanaayen bhi dete hai to desh main hamen gaaliyaan padani shuru ho jaati hai
 There will be some such people in Pakistan too
 lekin iskaa matlab ye nahin ki puraa pakistan or puraa bharat kharaab he

 The way Rani plays a challenging role after marriage is being praised
 rani ne ek intervyuu main hiroinon kii shaadi ko lekar bane dabl standard ke bare main khulkar baaten kin
 When Rani spoke on CBSE paper leak, students are preparing, then what is the harm in the exam? In an interview given to "indian Express", when Rani was asked about her face glow, she said, "this glow is because of my daughter
" is
 hitchkee ko logon kaa jo positive respons mil rahaa he ye bhi unke khush hone kaa ek kaaran he
 In response to a question, he said, it is double standard in Bollywood that it is not easy to reconcile personal and professional life after marriage
 khaskar tab jab aap maa bhi hon
 Rani said, i can say with confidence that my daughter is my biggest inspiration and because of that i feel fresh
 REVIEW: 'hitchkee' main rani mukherjee kii damdaar acting, par screenple kamzorrani ne yah bhi bataaya ki kai log aise hai jo mujhe shaadi ke baad bhi vaise hi prerit karte hai jaise pehle karte the
 They have no problem with me getting married or being a mother
 rani ke mutabik ''main abhi bhi waisi hi ladki hum jaisi shaadi ke pehle thi
 Changes in personal life cannot affect my career ''
 rani ko he beti kii chintaa, rakhana chaahati hai is cheez se durraani ne kaha ki abhinaytaon ko is baat (shaadi) kii parvaah nahin hoti
 Even after marriage, his career continues well
 sirf mahilaon ko lekar hi ye dharna he ki shaadi ke baad unka kariyar khatm ho jaataa he
 i do not agree with this
 mahilaayein bhi shaadi karne ke baad apane acting kariyar ko utani hi kamyaabi ke saath aage badha sakati hai

 Accusing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of being involved in everything related to 2G spectrum allocation, BJP said that the guilty person cannot impose his conditions
 usne kaha ki singh or grih mantri pi chidambaram ko ghotaale se sambandhit har sawaal kaa jawaab dena hoga
 PM, Sonia, clarify in 2G case: AIADMK main opposition party claimed that in the allocation of 2G spectrum, the Prime Minister was aware of all the minor things from first come first serve to alliances from foreign companies but now he has to overcome it

 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘e raja ne pradhanmantri ko nau patr likhe or donon ke bich 18 patron kaa aadan pradaan hua
 It has been clear that the Prime Minister was involved in the management of even the smallest case of spectrum allocation
 ’ unhone kaha ki raja or chidambaram ne saat april 2007 kii baithak main kuch videshi companiyon ko atirikt equity diye jane ko pratyaksh videshi nivesh ke anuroop bataaya tha
 But the Prime Minister, who has 'a tendency to distance himself from these matters', is now ignorant about it
 2ji maamle se meraa koi lenaa-dena nahin: pranavajetali ne kaha, ‘pradhanmantri jane maane arthshaastri he
 But when he came across the subject of additional equity allocation to the foreign partner, he did not doubt it
 yah koi jatil praudyogiki kaa vishay nahin he
 The Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha said, "the rules were twisted in the middle and the Prime Minister is adopting a strategy of attacking the opposition instead of answering these important questions
" ’ unhone kaha, ‘doshi vyakti apni sharte nahin thope saktaa he, pradhanmantri or chidambaram ko sab baton kaa jawaab dena hi hoga
 'significantly, on Sunday, an explanation came in the media on behalf of the PMO regarding the noting of the Prime Minister's private secretary in which the Prime Minister's instructions have been sent in the matter related to the allocation of spectrum

 After getting the information of the incident, the police has sealed the border of Noida

 The country's Finance Minister p Chidambaram has said that Narendra Modi's track record is tainted
 unhone kaha he ki modi atal bihari vaajapeyi or laalkrishna adwani se bade netaa kabhi nahin ho sakate
 Targeting the bjp's PM candidate, Chidambaram said in an interview to Reuters that the media exaggerated Modi and brought him to the national political stage
 ye sab media kaa banaaya hua he
 He also rubbished the talk of Modi becoming popular and the biggest leader emerging fast in the opposition
 haalanki vitt mantri ne kuch baton ke liye modi kii tarif bhi kii
 He said 'modi has united BJP workers
 unase desh ke shahari yuva bahut prabhavit hue hai
 On the weak state of the economy, he said that it is wrong to believe that all this is happening due to the Congress Party
 congress se pehle bhi satta main gathbandhan sarkarein ai hai or ghotaale hue hai
 On the situation of the falling rupee, he said, 'we feel that the message has been given on our behalf
 rupee kii sthiti par kayaas naa lagaae jaaen
 He said that the next Congress leader would be Rahul Gandhi
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe khushi hogi ki agar rahul gandhi piem banate hai
 He supported giving command in the hands of the youth
 unhone kaha, 'vakt aa gaya he ki ab satta yuva peedi ke haathon main saunpi jaae

 Certainly there is no doubt that the most benefit has been the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United and Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party
 in donon ko saath rakhane ke liye bhaajapa ne siton or saansadon dono kii gathbandhan dharm nibhaane ke liye qurbaani di
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is seen in the biggest benefit, whose party won only two seats in the JDU Lok Sabha elections, but this time it will contest seventeen seats
 aaj se dhai maheene pehle tak kisi ko ummid bhi nahin thi ki bijepi nitish kumaar ko baraabar ke formule par 17 siten dene par raji ho jaaegi
 But you call it Nitish's political status or the BJP realizes the ground reality in the present situation
 bhaajapa ne nitish kii sirf isi ichha ko nahin mana, balki pehle jithan ram maanjhi ko or baad main upendra kushvaha ko endie se bhi baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 BJP had two opinions about Kushwaha
 lekin 2019 ke chunaav main nitish kumaar ko khush rakhana bijepi kii badi praathamikta thi he
 Nitish had also signed a tie-up agreement with BJP President Amit Shah two months earlier as he knew that the bjp's stance could change even more if the results of the three state assembly elections are favorable
 lekin in chunavi nateezon kaa phayda lok janashakti party ke adhyaksh ramvilas paswan ne bhi khub uthaaya
 Ram Vilas Paswan's son Chirag Paswan started public tweets and rhetoric on the whistleblower attitude of the BJP
 ek bayaan main unhone notebandi par bhi sidhe piem modi se sawaal kar liya
 The BJP certainly came under pressure as they were aware that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also wanted the Rajya Sabha's assurances to be fulfilled
 bijepi is baat se bhi dari thi ki agar paswan ruuth gayi to mahagathbandhan kaa daravaaza unke liye khulaa he jo bijepi ke liye bahut hi nuksaandaayak sabit ho saktaa he
 At the same time, BJP leaders say that for the first time after 1996, BJP and JDU will contest in equal number of seats in Bihar politics
 saal 2014 ko chhod den to janata dal united or uske pehle samta party bijepi se hameshaa kai adhik siton par chunaav ladate rahi he
 The 'sacrifice' that the BJP has made for its allies in Bihar has sent a message of how much we give respect to our allies
 jahaan tak paswan ko rajyasabha seat dene kaa sawaal he to nishchit rup se iskaa ek sakaaratmak asar dalit votaron par hoga
 It seems that the impact of what Rahul Gandhi had said to learn from the Aam Aadmi Party after the defeat of the Congress in Delhi has started showing its effect in Bihar
 vichaaron ke str par congressi kitna sikh rahe hai, yah kahana to mushkil he, par congressiyon ne haath main jhaadoo jarur tham lee he
 In Delhi, the 'broom' cleaned the 'hand', while in Bihar the 'hand' held the 'broom'
 chaukiye mat, dilli chunaav ke baad bihar ke congressiyon ne sachmuch haath main jhaadu tham lee he
 Before the Aam Aadmi Party comes out on the streets with a broom, the Congressmen have already come to a halt
 bihar pradesh congress adhyaksh rajya main anoothaa prayog kar rahe hai
 Every week on Sunday, a group of Congressmen are taking to the streets and taking the initiative to clean the streets
 yahi he bihar congress kii nai muhim
 This is unique to see, because no one has seen Congress on the streets for years
 haalanki congressiyon kii yah muhim pradesh main 'photo seshan' zyada lag rahaa he or muhim kam, par isane bihar main congress ko surkhiyon main rahane kaa mauka jarur de diya he
 According to the state Congress, by clearing the road with the broom, they have come down to real politics

 In the 5 years between 2012 and 2017, 1062 children were kidnapped or disappeared from Gurugram

 So far, no clue of 365 minor children has been found
 aankadon kii maane to sirf 2017 main hi gurugram se 154 maasoom kidanap kar liye gaye laapata ho gaye
 The missing include 115 girls
 gurugram police ne yah aankade jari kiye hai
 The disappearing innocent people in Cyber city Gurugram are becoming a headache for the police administration
 khule aasmaan main chahak rahe in masuumon ko kya pataa kii laalach kii tokari main napak mansuba hota he
 Recently, many such cases have come to light in Gurugram, where the innocence was reached by getting entangled in relationships or by coveting toffee
 gurugram police ke aankadon par gaur karen to saaf ho jaataa he ki gurugram main maasoom surakshit nahin hai
 Since 2012, 1062 children have been victims of missing or kidnapping incidents, of which 677 were girls
 inamen 312 ladakiyon ko police ne sakushal barmaad kar liya, lekin 365 ladakiyon kaa abhi bhi koi suraag gurugram police kachildren missing selanhin laga paaya he
 While the situation of minor boys is not much improved in cyber city of missing or kidnapped
 isamen bhi beete 5 saal yani 2012 se 2017 tak 385 naaballig bachche gumshuda hue yaa apharan kar liye gaye
 Out of these 180 Gurugram police have successfully done so, but even in these, Gurugram police have not been able to find any clue about 205 children

 Not only this, Haryana and Rajasthan have the highest number of girls
 vahaan kai aise kasbe or gaanv hai jahaan ladakiyon ko shaadi karne ke liye bechaa jaataa he
 It is also believed that behind the disappearance of children below ten years, the hand of the gangs who have come to eat on a large scale
 gurugram main aadha darjan se zyada gang apana jaal bichhaae hue hai
 The gangs operating here transfer the gangs operating in other cities after stealing the children

 Akhilesh government used to give 500 rupees every month to women under socialist pension which he had promised to do 1000 rupees during election but Yogi government is ready to stop it and do something new

 com / 4gedumv4oi bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav par joardaar hamalaa bolte hue mangalvaar ko kaha ki vah rajya ko bhi usee tarah chalaanaa chaahate hai, jis tarah se samaajawaadee party (sapa) ko chalaate hai
 BJP has requested the Chief Minister that he should accept his mistake with a big heart
 bijepi kii pradesh ikai ke pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak ne kaha, "akhilesh soobe ko bhi apni party kii tarah hi chalaane par amada hai
 What they feel will be good, what they don't feel will not be
 apni suvidha ke anusaar vah soobe ko chalaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 " pathak ne kaha ki sapa ke netaa kabhi bina iees ke sarkaar chalaane kaa bayaan dekar apni khiz utaarte hai to kabhi netaaon ko upra na aane tak kii salaah de daalate hai
 He said, "in the case of suspended IAS officer Durga Shakti Nagpal, the government should accept its mistake with a lot of heart
" kai muddon par role back karne vaali sarkaar is maamle main apni bhul ko kyon nahin sweekaar kar rahi he
 After all, under whose pressure the government is avoiding accepting its mistake
 " He said that senior SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav had recently admitted that very strict action was taken against Durga Shakti Nagpal
 achaanak hi unka you-turn lete hue yah kahana ki bina iees adhikariyon ke hi pradesh chalaa lenge, pradesh ko araajaktaa kii ore dhakelne kii badi sajeesh kaa ek hissaa he
 The comments pathak ne kaha ki sthaneey abhisuchana ikai (elaiu) report ke samaane aane ke baad bhi yah baat sabit ho gai he ki durga shakti nagpal kaa nilamban kahin se bhi jaij nahin he
 The Chief Minister is referring to the suspension of Durga Shakti Nagpal that she was suspended on the basis of the report of the Intelligence Department, the same report does not even mention any such thing against Durga Shakti
 pathak ne kaha ki vibhinn reporton se yah sabit ho gaya he ki sarkaar is puure prakaran main sirf apni manamaani karne par tuli hui he or iskaa dushprinaam ek eemaandaar mahila iees adhikari ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 BJP state unit spokesperson Vijay Bahadur Pathak said, "akhilesh is intent on running the state like his own party
 unhen jo thik lagegaa vah rahegaa jo nahi lagegaa vah nahin rahegaa
 He is trying to run the state as per his convenience
 " Pathak said that SP leaders sometimes give vent to their anger by giving a statement of running the government without IAS, sometimes they advise the leaders not to come up
 unhone kaha, "nilambit iees adhikari durga shakti nagpal ke maamle main bade man se sarkaar ko apni bhul sweekaar kar leni chahie

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi will fill his nomination papers from Wayanad Lok Sabha seat in Kerala on Thursday
 gandhi parivaar se rahul gandhi tisare aise shaks honge jo dakshin bharat kii kisi seat se chunaav ladenge
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claims that the Amethi seat was no longer safe for Rahul Gandhi, so he went to Kerala in search of a safe seat
 haalanki congress ne bijepi ke is daawey par palatwaar karte hue kaha ki rahul gandhi apni daadi indira gandhi or maa sonia gandhi kii tarah hi rashtriya netaa ke taur par ubhar rahe hai, aise main unka do siton par chunaav ladanaa uttar or dakshin bharat ke bich sethu kaa kaam karegaa
 The biggest discussion in political circles is whether Rahul will be able to succeed like his grandmother and mother by contesting from safe seat? Let us know which leaders of the Gandhi family and which Congress presidents made the party successful by contesting elections from South India

 donon jagahon se jeet hasil karne ke baad unhone raibareli seat chhodkar madak seat kaa chayan kiya
 Sonia Gandhi: Former Congress president Sonia Gandhi had contested the elections simultaneously from Bellary in Karnataka and Amethi Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh in 1999
 unhone donon siton par jeet hasil kii, lekin unhone bellari seat chhodkar amethi seat se saansad bananaa pasand kiya
 He defeated veteran BJP leader Sushma Swaraj from Bellary
 sonia gandhi ko 1999 kaa chunaav jeetne ke baad kareeb do maheene baad hi congress party kaa adhyaksh bana diya gaya
 When there was talk of making him Prime Minister, then Congress leaders Sharad Pawar, PA Sangma and Tariq Anwar objected to Sonia being a foreign citizen and opposed becoming Prime Minister
 teenon ne baad main congress se alag hokar nesanalist congress party (ensipi) bana lee
 Rahul Gandhi: Like his grandmother and mother, the current Congress president Rahul Gandhi is trying his luck this time from Amethi in Uttar Pradesh as well as from Wayanad parliamentary seat in Kerala

 At first, there was an attempt to explain it differently
 ab ise phir se samajhane-samajhane kii koshish ho rahi he
 When the Modi government started a cleanliness campaign in the name of Gandhi, the Congress was left in a mood
 haalanki baad main congress netaa shor machaane lage
 It is alleged that Congress icons are trying to grab men by Prime Minister Modi and BJP
 congress shashan main namakaran ke maamle main sarkari yojanaayen nehru-gandhi parivaar kii milkiyat najar aati thim
 Now, he will probably be replaced by the names of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and bjp's symbol men
 vaajapeyi ko bharat ratna dekar nai sarkaar ne un iraadon par muhar bhi laga di
 By going a little further, it was found that now the days of the schemes going on in the name of Nehru were over
 ab atal mishandesh ke pehle pradhanmantri nehru ke naam par chalane vaale 'jeenenyuarem' kaarykram ko ab atal mishan for rijuvanet and urban transformation (eemaruti) ke naam se janaa jayega
 The first phase program of 'JNNURM' finally ended last year
 upie-2 sarkaar ne 'jeenenyuarem' ne duusare charan kii taiyaariyaan to kar lee thim, lekin skim ko manjuuri nahin mil pai thi
 The new system did not have to put much effort into it
 sushasan ke naam palatal bihari vaajapeyi ke janmdin ko sarkaar ne sushasan diwas ke taur par manaane kii yojana banaai
 When the news came in the media, there was a round of statements - there was a lot of ruckus
 kaaryakramon main pherbadal ke saath rasm adaayagi se hi santosh karnaa padaa
 On which, like the Talwar JNNURM, the Central Government has a scheme - Jawaharlal Nehru Rojgar Yojana
 sambhav he kuch din baad iskaa bhi naam badal diya jaae [haalanki, abhi aisi koi khabar ai nahin he]
 Apart from this there are hundreds of awards, scholarships and institutes which are named after Nehru
 aaie ab najar daalate hai un par jin par talwaar lataki dikhti he
 These are - Jawaharlal Nehru International Peace Award, Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Medal, Nehru Bal Samiti Bravery Award, Jawaharlal Nehru Child Welfare Award, Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund, Soviet Land Nehru Award, Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding, Jawaharlal Nehru National Science Competition Awards, Jawaharlal Nehru Prize for Popularization of Science etc
 atal or patelmedia reports par gaur karen to pataa chalata he ki sarkari yojanaon se nehru-gandhi parivaar kaa naam hataane ke liye centre sarkaar dhire dhire kadam badha rahi he
 The way the scheme has been named after Atal in place of Nehru, in the coming days there will be many such schemes that will remove the name of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and replace him with Sardar Patel
 bijepi kabhi party vid diference hone kaa daawa karti thi
 The same BJP has now attacked the name of the nehru-gandhi family in government papers
 kal tak jin baton par bijepi shor machaati thi, satta main aane ke baad ab wo bhi usee ko amali jama pahana rahi he
 Whatever may be the intentions of the leaders - the spirit is probably the same
 vaise bhi sab baaten hai baton kaa kya

 We will be testing different options in select countries where members will be able to watch Netflix on a mobile device at a lower price and subscribe for a shorter time, for example
 haalanki ye opshans har yugers nahin dekh paaenge or ham ise test phej ke baad cancil bhi kar sakate hai
 'netflix has said,' Mobile only plan is for testing only

 lekin ye plan keval mobile / tablet ke liye hi pesh kiya gaya he

 There is a meeting in the morning, i have to prepare the presentation

 ' sunil ne tab apane bete se kaha ki 15 din kii chuttee lekar ghar aa jaao
 Sarveshreshtha's answer- No leave will be given, so the father said, 'they have to say that consider it my resignation
 ' After this, Best said to go to his apartment in an hour and then repeated the matter of returning in the morning
 lekin apane ghar se aadhi mile dur sthit apartment tak sarvshereshth nahin pahunch paae, chuttee par ghar lautne ke badale mata-pita ko san francisco janaa padaa bete kaa shav lene ke liye
 The New York Times report said that Best was liked by people from across the office
 unke kai sahakarmiyon ke mutabik, vah kaam main bahut nipun tha
 Due to efficiency in work and its work ethic, work load was also high on it
 sachin tendulkar ke fain sarvshereshth footbal kii team arsenal or barsilona ke bhi mureed the, lekin investment banking kii duniya main unhen in sab chizon ke liye vakt nahin mil paa rahaa tha
 Best said during a conversation with his father in March 2015, 'this job is not for me, a lot of work is done and there is no time for the rest of the work
 ' us vakt sarvshereshth hafte main sau ghante se zyaada kaam kar rahe the or kai baar to puure hafte tak unhen kaam karnaa pad rahaa tha
 The pressure of work was so high that contrary to the father's wish, Best resigned from his job
 lekin ek saptaah ke andar hi goldman sac ke adhikariyon ne use kaam par waapas lautne ke liye manaa liya
 Sunil Gupta has written, "the company asked him to consider his resignation and under my pressure he started going to work again
 ' After his return to the job, Best's work hours were definitely reduced and he also consulted a counselor to relieve stress during work
 lekin isse unki kaamkaaji duniya main koi badlaav nahin aayaa or mahaj 22 saal kii umr main unki sandigdh paristhitiyon main maut ho gai
 The cause of death has not been known yet

 haalanki, yah dar doctoron main finance sector ke peshewaron se bhi zyada hoti he
 These examples show how the young generation is having to put their lives at stake for the glitter of Wall Street and the hefty salary of thousands of dollars
 is post ke mutabik apane pita ke saath antim baatcheet main 16 april ko dopaher 3
 Best said at 10 o'clock, "enough is enough, for the last two days i have not been able to sleep

 Sachin Tendulkar's fans were also fans of the best football team Arsenal and Barcelona, but in the world of investment banking, he could not find time for all these things
 sarvshereshth ne apane pita se march, 2015 main ek baatcheet ke dauraan kaha tha, 'ye naukari mere liye nahin he, khub sara kaam hota he or baaqi kaam ke liye samay nahin miltaa

 neuyork times kii report main kaha gaya he ki sarvshereshth ko puure daftar ke log pasand karte the
 According to many of his colleagues, he was very skilled at work
 kaam main dakshata or uske work ithik ke chalate us par kaam kaa lod bhi zyada rahata tha
 Sachin Tendulkar's fans were also fans of the best football team Arsenal and Barcelona, but in the world of investment banking, he could not find time for all these things
 sarvshereshth ne apane pita se march, 2015 main ek baatcheet ke dauraan kaha tha, 'ye naukari mere liye nahin he, khub sara kaam hota he or baaqi kaam ke liye samay nahin miltaa
 'at that time the best were working more than a hundred hours a week and sometimes they had to work for the whole week
 kaam kaa dabaav itnaa zyada tha ki pita kii ichha ke vipareet sarvshereshth ne apni naukari se istifa de diya
 But within a week, Goldman Sack officials convinced him to return to work
 sunil gupta ne likhaa he, 'company ne use istife par vichaar karne ko kaha tha or mere dabaav main usne phir se kaam par janaa shuru kar diya
 ' naukari par vaapasi ke baad sarvshereshth ke kaam ke ghante kuch kam jarur hue the or unhone kaam ke dauraan hone vaale tanaav ko dur karne ke liye counslar kii salaah bhi lee
 But this did not change his working world and he died at the age of 22 under suspicious circumstances

 ' darasal, financiel sector main kaam karne vaale logon par duusare kshetra ke mutabik kaam kaa dabaav zyada hota he
 According to the American National Occupational Mortality Surveillance, the suicidal tendency among those working in the finance sector is 1 in the general public

 However, this rate is higher than that of doctors in the finance sector
 ye udhaaharan bataate hai ki kaise wal street kii chamak-damak or hajaaron dollar kii moti pagaar ke liye yuva peedi ko apana jivan daanv par lagaana pad rahaa he
 Best said during a conversation with his father in March 2015, 'this job is not for me, a lot of work is done and there is no time for the rest of the work
 ' us vakt sarvshereshth hafte main sau ghante se zyaada kaam kar rahe the or kai baar to puure hafte tak unhen kaam karnaa pad rahaa tha
 The pressure of work was so high that contrary to the father's wish, Best resigned from his job
 lekin ek saptaah ke andar hi goldman sac ke adhikariyon ne use kaam par waapas lautne ke liye manaa liya
 Sunil Gupta has written, "the company asked him to consider his resignation and under my pressure he started going to work again
 ' After his return to the job, Best's work hours were definitely reduced and he also consulted a counselor to relieve stress during work
 lekin isse unki kaamkaaji duniya main koi badlaav nahin aayaa or mahaj 22 saal kii umr main unki sandigdh paristhitiyon main maut ho gai

 In the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the Congress has suffered a severe defeat
 bijepi or narendra modi kii tsunami is kadar chali ki amethi se congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi hi chunaav haar gaye
 However, it is a matter of relief for the Congress that he will be able to represent his party in the Lok Sabha as he has decided to contest from Amethi this time from Kerala to Wayanad also from where he has won
 rahul to ek seat se chunaav jeet gaye lekin loksabhaa main unki kor team kaa hissaa kahe jane vaale jyotiraditya sindhiya
 Leaders like Deepender Hooda, Sushmita Dev and Mallikarjun Kharge had to face defeat
 loksabhaa main modi sarkaar par sabase zyada hamalavar rahane vaale in netaaon kii kami congress party ko jarur khalegi
 In Mallikarjun Khadgesdan, the Congress party leader Mallikarjun Kharge had the opportunity to speak first from the opposition as he was the leader of the largest party after BJP
 beete 5 saal main khadge ne vibhinn muddon par sarkaar ko aade haath liya
 Kharge, who came from non-hindi speaking states of Karnataka, spoke Hindi in the House and was sometimes seen to criticize the government's policies through shero-shayari
 vah apane raajnneetik kariyar kaa pehla chunaav haare hai
 Prior to this, Kharge has been a two-time MP and 9 times MLA
 unki haar ke baad congress ke saamne sadan main party kaa nayaa netaa chunane kaa sankat bhi aa gaya he
 This time, Shashi Tharoor or Rahul Gandhi himself can be elected as the leader of the Congress party in the House
 jyotiraditya sindhiyarahul gandhi ke thik bagal main baithne vaale jyotiraditya sindhiya is baar loksabhaa ke bheetar nahin dikhenge
 Scindia has been defeated by Bharatiya Janata Party's Krishna Pal Singh alias KP Yadav from Guna
 sindhiya ko rahul gandhi kaa kareebi kaha jaataa he or yahi vajah rahi ki unhen priyanka gandhi ke saath pashchimi upi main congress ko jitaane kaa jimmaa diya gaya tha
 Scindia, the general secretary of the party, could not save even his traditional seat in UP by reviving the Congress
 harvard uniwarsity se padhakar aae sindhiya sadan ke bheetar apane tej-tarraar sawaalon se satta paksh par nishaanaa sadhate aae hai
 Sushmita was among the most vocal female mps of Sushmita Devkangress
 rahul gandhi kii aguwai main unhen mahila congress kaa adhyaksh niyukt kiya gaya or mahilaon se jude muddon par loksabhaa main sushmita congress kii ore se sarkaar se sawaal karti dikhti raheen
 At times Sushmita's speech was also praised by the leaders of the ruling parties
 lekin is baar vah bhi sadan kaa hissaa nahin he
 From Silchar for Assam, bjp's Rajdeep Roy defeated Dev in the election
 sushmita ke kad kaa pataa is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi tak unke liye road sho karne silchar gai thim, jahaan unhone sushmita kii tulana purv piem indira gandhi se kii thi
 Ranjita Ranjan Ranjita Ranjan, who has been the opposition's most fire brand MP on women's issues, has also suffered a defeat this time
 bihar se supaul se ranjita chunaav haar gai hai
 Ranjita, who is known for her different style and innocence, is the wife of former MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav
 mujffarpur main shelter home main ladakiyon se rape ke maamle ko ranjita ne sansad ke bheetar sabase joardaar tareeke se uthaaya tha
 She has never been behind in raising slogans against the government, from protesting against the government
 lekin 17veen loksabhaa main congress party samet samoochaa vipaksh sadan main unki kami mahasoos karegaa
 Deepender Hooda's loss to Rohitak of Deepender Hoodahriyana is nothing short of a shock for the Congress
 yuva netaa hooda ko bijepi ke arvind kumaar sharma ne shikast di
 Deepender is also a part of Rahul Gandhi's youth team and also sits with him in the House
 apane pichley kaarykaal main hooda ne loksabhaa ke bheetar kul 81 sawaal puche jabaki teen baar vah privet member bill lekar aae
 Hooda has repeatedly favored the Congress party in the Lok Sabha on issues surrounding the Modi government, including various issues in Haryana
 iske alaava congress main sanghathan mahasachiv kaa pad sambhaal rahe kasee venugopal bhi aise netaa hai jinhone puure paanch saal tak modi sarkaar par sadan ke bheetar nishaanaa saadhaa lekin is baar unhone sanghathan kii jimmedaari sambhalate hue chunaav na ladane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Venugopal, an MP from Alappuzha in Kerala, is one of the leaders closest to Congress President Rahul Gandhi and this is the reason he has been given the responsibility of organization general secretary after senior leaders like Ashok Gehlot
 venugopal ke alaava aarthik maamle par majboot pakad rakhane vaale virappa moili ko bhi congress party is loksabhaa main jarur miss karegi, jo bajet charchaa ke dauraan sarkaar kii nitiyon ke khilaaf pramukhataa se congress kaa paksh rakhaa karte the

 comlabboluabahamare samay main jaankariyon kaa visphot ho rahaa he
 The system of information has evolved so much and it is happening that everything seems unstable, moving due to the speed
 is sabakaa dabaav sahitya par padana anivaary he
 Along with his object, his forms are also breaking
 vastu kii vyakhya-vishleshan karne waalon kii kami nahin he lekin rup par gambhir vichaar karne vaale kam kya, durlabh hai
 In such a situation, this book, which has a fundamental consideration of the literary forms of eminent storyteller and thinker Arun Prakash, has historical significance
 is kitaab ke prarambh main hi rup-bandha or vidha ko pruthak karte hue farm ke liye rupabandh or jiner ke liye vidha shabd kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 The word-coincidence is fundamental
 hindi aalochana main ab tak rup or vidha main aisa antar nahin kiya jaataa tha
 It is expected that the experiment-difference proposed by Arun Prakash will be valid
 acharya ramchandra shukla ne hi gadhy kii prakharata sthapit kar di thi
 Prose has become almost the only language-form of our social behavior
 isiilie usamen nae-nae rupbandhon or vidhaon kaa avishkaar nirantar ho rahaa he
 Arun Prakash has composed this book in a decisive and unprecedentedly active phase in the history of Hindi prose and has evaluated the problems and analysis-analysis arising out of this activity
 vichaar prakriya se guzarane vaala pathak is baat kaa anubhav aadyant karata rahata he ki lekhak ne jin tathyon ke aadhaar par nishkarsh nikaale hai ve vishwasaneey to hai hi, vichaarak ne unhen antim yaa sthir nahin, nirantar viksmaan or gatvar mana he
 Arun Prakash has chosen a difficult path, not an easy one
 tathy sankalan itane vyapak str par kiya gaya he ki prayek rup-bandha (yaa vidha) kaa itihaas bhi lapet main aa gaya he or uske pramukh naam bhi
 This work has spread not only in Hindi but also in many languages
 pathak kitaab padhate hue anekanek vidya anushasano or saamaajik itihaas kii durlabh (kabhi-kabhi chaunkaane vaali) soochnaaon se mukhaatib hota he
 The reason for these information is undoubtedly the author's knowledge
 lekhak patrkaar to hai hi, ve itihaas main vishesh ruchi rakhte hai
 The book depicts the latest prose genres
 un vidhaon ke udbhav ke saamaajik, aitihaasik sandarbh kaa nepathy bataaya gaya he
 These genres are so mixed and similar that their morphological privacy often disappears
 anbhavi hi jaanate hai ki sahitya kii vidhaon par kaam karne vaale ko manovishleshak ke saath-saath maansik pravritiyon kii bhi pahchaan honi chahieh ''smriti ke val soochna nahin he ki use shuddh rup se phir se hasil kar liya jaae
 Memory also tarnishes our ability to recognize information
 aap khoj rahe hai kuch, mila usase miltaa-julata kuch or
 
 
 That is why the memoir should be viewed with suspicion
 use andeh se pare maanane kii galati katai nahin kerani chahie
 "this book has been written by a journalist, more than that, a creator and more than that, a patriotic multi-person with a socialist ideology
" yah vastutah aalochana kii pustak he
 Due to its writing style, it has also become a book of history of genres with criticism
 bich-bich main arun prakaash kaa rachanaakaar aata he jo is aalochana-itihaas kii pustak ko sarjanaatmak pathneeyata se samprukt kar detaa he

 An FIR has been lodged against Incredible Mafatlal's wife and socialite Sheetal Mafatlal on Friday for falsely accusing his friends of pretending to steal a painting worth Rs 100 crore
 mumbai police kii krime branch kii unit 2 ne yah exiaar tab darj kii, jab sheethal ke devar ajay mafatlal or dost yasmine ne hai court main yachika daayar kii
 Sheetal had falsely accused the two of stealing the painting
 asal main sheethal nisali painting churaakar unhen nakli paintingse badalane kaa yah aarope apane doston yasmine, aarif patel or faruk wadiya par lagaaya tha
 According to Yasmin, when the talk of Sheetal being separated from her husband Incredible, Sheetal's friends agreed to keep these paintings
 lekin baad main sach saamne aayaa ki paintings paramfatlal companika adhikaar tha
 Sheetpal will now go to the case for making false allegations against his friends

 Illegal construction of the Yamuna river has hit its head
 bataa de ki dilli main avaidh nirmaan ko rokane ke liye supreme court ne 2006 main monitering cameti banaai thi, lekin uske baad bhi dilli main avaidh nirmaan thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 In the yamuna-khadar area of okhla, people have started building houses by filling the Yamuna river with debris, because of the illegal construction
 jiske baad monitering cameti ko lekar siyasat hone lagi he
 On the illegal construction in Yamuna Khadar area, chairman of the Monitoring Committee, Bhurelal said that it has complained many times to South MCD, but no action was taken
 monitering cameti ke adhyaksh ne kaha ki rajdhani dilli main jo avaidh nirmaan ho rahaa he, uske liye emsidi, dilli sarkaar or didie teenon jimmedaar hai
 He said that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) did not listen to the monitoring committee's complaint
 emsidi kii satta main bijepi he, jab manoj tiwari se baat kii to unhone monitering cameti par hi sawaal khadey kar die or kaha, monitering cameti ko bhang kar dena chahie
 Let me tell you that for the past several years in Delhi, the genie of sealing and illegal construction is becoming a problem for the leaders along with the people
 netaaon kii najar main monitering cameti hameshaa khatkati rahi he
 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has said many times that he will dissolve the Monitoring Committee as soon as Delhi comes to power

 When the BJP formed a majority government in 2014, even before taking oath as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi had started looking for 'navratnas' for his team
 sutron ke mutabik apane prumakh sachiv pad ke liye unhen aisa kaabil afasar chahie tha, jise na keval centre main kaam karne kaa lanbaa anubhav ho, balki daaman par bhi koi daag na ho
 At the same time, Uttar Pradesh, which gives the maximum number of Lok Sabha seats to the officer, should also have an understanding of the vein
 upi se naata rakhane vaale iees afasar ko isliye bhi modi pramukh sachiv bananaa chaahate the taaki vah apane sansadeey kshetra varanasi ke liye bhi kuch bada kar sakenge
 a strategy can also be chalked out for UP from Delhi
 modi kii yah khoj 1967 batch ke ritred iees nripendra mishra par jaakar khatm hui
 Having worked with two Chief Ministers in a big state like Uttar Pradesh, Nripendra Mishra, who stayed away from the headlines, fit perfectly on Modi's scale
 jiske baad vah 2014 main pradhanmantri ke pramukh sachiv bane
 The confidence of Nripendra Mishra was that he was among the few officers who got such a big chair in the Modi government even without the 'gujarat connection'
 amuman gujarat main mukhyamantri rahete saath kaam kiye afasaron par hi modi ne centre main bharosa jataayaa tha
 Nripendra Mishra, who was successful in winning the trust of PM Modi with his work in the last term, has now become the Principal Secretary, Prime Minister again
 pradhanantri ke pramukh sachiv kaa kaam piemo or cabinet sachivalay ke bich mukhya kadi banakar samanvay karne kaa hota he
 Even the TRAI Act could not be enacted, Nripendra Mishra held the post of chairman of TRAI between 2006 and 2009 after being a roadside coach
 niyam ke mutabik tri kaa chairman aage chalakar centre yaa rajya sarkaar main koi pad dhaaran nahin kar saktaa tha
 When this rule became an obstacle in the way of Nripendra Mishra, the Modi government amended the TRAI Act through an ordinance, paving the way for becoming its Principal Secretary
 yah kadam bhi piem modi kaa unke prati bharose kaa saboot mana jaataa he
 Now, even in the second term of the Modi government, when he is appointed as the Principal Secretary, it is believed that this is due to the complete threat and win confidence in PM Modi's expectations
 jiske inaam ke taur par unhen is baar phir pramukh sachiv banane ke saath cabinet mantri kii rank se bhi nawaja gaya he
 After retirement, Nripendra Mishra joined the Public Interest Foundation (PIF) after retiring from the post of chairman of thinktank
 dilli ke greater kailash sthit daftar main vah kuch research scolers ke saath kaam karte the
 This foundation is known to serve as a think tank to connect marginalized people in the society to the mainstream of development
 jab 2014 main bahumat se bijepi kii sarkaar bani to narendra modi kii ore se unhen piemo sanbhaalane ke liye bulaava aayaa
 After which Nripendra Mishra left PIF and took charge in PMO
 centre-rajya main kaam kaa lanbaa anubhavupi kader ke iees nripendra mishra kabhi mulaayam singh yadav or kalyaan singh sarkaar main pramukh sachiv rahe
 While working in this big state, he made a mark of a flamboyant and honest officer
 jiske inaam ke taur par unhen pratiniyukti par centre main kaam karne kaa mauka mila
 He held many important positions in the center
 department of telecommunications main sachiv rahe
 Also served as Secretary in the Department of Fertilizers from 2002 to 2004
 ritair hone ke baad manmohan sarkaar main vah 2006 se 2009 ke bich telecom regulatory athurity of india (tri) ke bhi chairman rahe
 Not only in the country but also abroad, Nripendra Mishra, who had studied in institutions like Kamjon F
 Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, worked not only in the country but also abroad
 unhone vishwa vyapaar sanghathan(dablutio) main special secretary ke taur par kaam karte hue desh se jude maamalon main majbootee se paksh rakhaa
 Apart from this, he was a joint secretary in the Ministry of Commerce
 iske alaava world bank, asian development bank, nepal sarkaar main salaahkaar ke rup main kaary kiya

 Instead of selecting Suresh Raina and Gautam Gambhir for the Champions Trophy, Dinesh Karthik was questioned by the selectors on social media
 unka maananaa tha ki dinesh karthik gautam gambhir or suresh raina kii tulana main achche khilaadi nahi hai
 He may have performed well in domestic cricket and IPL but he could not do anything special when he got a chance
 vanade main unka sabase zyada score 79 rahaa he
 Their average is 27
 93 he or ab tak 7 ardhshtak jamaaye hai
 The comments aisa nahin he ki unki pratibha main koi kami he
 He holds all cricket shots and specializes in playing spin balls
 vah ek achche wicket keeper bhi hai
 Actually, Virender Sehwag has questioned former captain Sourav Ganguly on his selection
 sahvaag ne yah sawaal champions trophy ke liye bharat or newjiland ke bich chal rahe abhyaas match ke dauraan camentry main poocha tha
 At that time, Dinesh Karthik was batting at the crease
 sahvaag ne chirparichit andaaj main ganguli se poocha ki kya dinesh karthik kaa sellection kisi andhvishwaas kii vajah se kiya gaya he
 Although Ganguly could give some answers, Sehwag himself said that India won the Champions Trophy in 2013, even then Dinesh Karthik was in the team
 aisa to nahin he ki is baar bhi isliye karthik ko jagah di gai ho
 Then Sehwag asked Ganguly another question that when he was the captain, did he believe in such things that a player gets victory by keeping him in the team
 sahvaag kii is baat par ganguli hansane lage or unka jawaab tha 'aise nahin hota he'
 Let me tell you that in this practice match against New Zealand, Dinesh Karthik could not score much runs and fell victim to a bouncer
 lekin mangalvaar ko bangladesh ke khilaaf hue abhyaas match main dinesh karthik ne shandaar ardhshtak banaaya
 In the beginning, he played resiliently, first overcome Team India from the crisis and then made four more shots in the field
 apane is pradarshan ke dam par unhone team india main shaamil hone kaa majboot kiya he
 It is believed that if Yuvraj Singh, who is suffering from fever, is not fit before June 4, then Dinesh Karthik could be retained in the team against Pakistan

 He holds all cricket shots and specializes in playing spin balls

 phir sahvaag ne ganguli se ek or sawaal poocha ki jab vah captain the to kya aisi baton par vishwaas karte the ki kisi khilaadi ko team main rakhane par jeet mil jaati he
 Ganguly started laughing at Sehwag's point and his reply was 'such ain't happen'
 aapako bataa den ki newjiland ke khilaaf is abhyaas match main dinesh karthik zyada ran nahin bana paae the or ek bounsar kaa shikaar ho gaye
 But in the practice match against Bangladesh on Tuesday, Dinesh Karthik scored a brilliant half-century

 On the basis of this performance, he has strengthened his involvement in Team India
 mana ja rahaa he ki bukhaar se peedit yuvaraj singh agar 4 june ke pehle feet nahin hote hai to dinesh karthik ko pakistan ke khilaaf hone vaale match main team main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The MP said, 'I appeal to the governments of India and Pakistan to take a sabbatical and urge them to come to the negotiating table to reduce tensions with the United States
 ' unhone kaha ki vah is maanviya sankat kaa shantipurna hal nikaalane ke liye congress main apane sahyogiyon or prashasan ke saath kaam karte rahenge

 ' bharat ne spasht kar diya he ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 ke tahat jammu kashmir ko mili vishesh darje ko khatm karnaa desh kaa 'aantarik maamla' he
 India defended the imposition of restrictions in the Kashmir Valley, saying it was done to prevent Pakistan from spreading terrorism in the region
 pichley hafte, bhartiya-america congress kii sadsy pramila jaipal or ek anya saansad ne videsh mantri mike pompio se anurodh kiya tha ki vah bharat ko jammu-kashmir main sanchaar madhyamon par se roak ko turant hataane ke liye samajhaayen
