 pehle main apane saathi khiladiyon ko apane faisle se waakif karaungaa
 
 
 But after talking to Sanjay, Dhoni paid one of his duties before making his fellow players aware of his biggest decision
 behad shant andaaj main wo patrakaron ke bich gaye
 When Dhoni was talking about his team's success in the Melbourne Test, there was no feeling on his face that he had decided to take off the white jersey of the Sharifs game
 press conference khatm hui
 Fellow players thought that Dhoni would now strategize for Sydney Victory
 lekin yahaan dhoni ab kuch or karne ja rahe the
 When he left the press conference, he called all the players of his team to the dressing room
 dhoni upar se to saamaanya dikh rahe the, lekin andar bhavukta kaa samandar umad rahaa tha
 While handling himself, Dhoni told his team member- Friends, i am leaving Test cricket
 in saat shabdon ne yangistan ke tamaam ranviron ko saat pataal kii gaharaai main dhakel diya
 Who could have thought that Dhoni would bid farewell to the Test in one stroke
 dhoni 100 test se mahaj 10 kadam kii duuri par the
 Ten Tests could be played for a record
 yaa phir world cap ke baad dhoni istipha de sakate the
 But wandering in the maze of data and records, no matter who it is, Dhoni cannot be
 duniya ko pataa he ki dhoni naa kisi ferewel ke bhukhe hai, naa dhoomadhadake naa kisi boom ke
 No player thought that Dhoni would come suddenly and so big
 
 
 
 Really, i will give such a big decision
 jo jahaan khadaa tha, vahi sann rah gaya
 Whether the next captain is Virat Kohli or Shikhar Dhawan called Gabbar
 yaa phir ajinkya rahane hon yaa cheteshwar pujaara yaa phir wo rahul, jise dhoni ne number 3 par utaara tha
 All emotional
 
 
 sabhi khamosh
 
 
 But that silence of the dressing room was screaming the most
 jis captain ne test main team ko number 1 banaaya
 He did not plead, nor heard the appeal, just came straight and made his decision
 chehre par bagaiyr koi bhav laae dhoni ne bade bade faisle kiye
 Faced controversies
 virdohi team ke hamale se jujhate rahe
 Won but did not fill in the joy of victory
 lekin team ko alavida kehete hue dhoni ke ankhon ne bhi unka saath nahin diya, wo ro pade, phir to team ke liye bhi apane aansuon ko sanbhaalanaa mushkil ho gaya

 With the slogan of 'chowkidar Chor Hai', Rahul Gandhi contested the Lok Sabha elections this time and tried to challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi hard, but his effort did not work for not only him but the Congress
 is baar bhi congress kai rajyon main khaataa tak nahin khol saki or khud rahul gandhi apni surakshit seat amethi sansadeey seat se smriti irani ke haathon chunaav haar gaye
 After the bitter defeat, he showed strong attitude within the party and announced to quit the post of president, but the officials requested him to continue in the post
 ab loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke 28wein din rahul gandhi apana 49waan janmdiwas manaa rahe hai, lekin unka yah janmdin pichhali kai chunavi naakaamiyon ke bich aayaa he
 Long before the announcement of Lok Sabha elections, he started his election preparations and tried to surround Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his own on many fronts including corruption and demonetisation, he was seen to be successful in his motive many times
 But his efforts failed to woo the general public and in the Lok Sabha election he hoped to win after becoming Congress president, i t was facing crushing defeat
 adhyaksh banane ke baad simatati congress2017 main gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle 16 disambar ko rahul gandhi ke congress adhyaksh ke pad par kabiz hone ke baad mana gaya ki party ke andar josh kaa sanchaar hoga or nae mukhiya kii aguwai main party na sirf narendra modi or amit shah kii ajey jodi ko pareshaan karegi, lekin aaj tak aisa kuch hota nahin dikhaa, 5 maheene pehle 3 rajyon kii vidhansabha chunaav main jeet ko chhod diya jaae to har ore bhartiya janata party lagaataar majboot hoti chali gai jabaki congress kaa dayera simatata chalaa gaya
 This time Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also joined the fray with Rahul Gandhi but failed (photo-twitter) In 2014, when Narendra Modi came to power at the Center, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was in power in only 7 states while the Congress There was power in 13 states, but after the assembly elections held in 3 states in March 2018, the BJP was running the government in 22 states, while the Congress was in power in only 4 states ( Njab, went all out in Karnataka, Mizoram and Puducherry)
 haalanki aaj kii taarikh main congress kii 6 rajyon (rajasthan, punjab, madhya pradesh, karnataka, chhattisgarh or pudducheri) main sarkaar chal rahi he
 The Lok Sabha elections were done
 Speaking of the Lok Sabha elections under the leadership of Hatsharahul Gandhi, in this year's Lok Sabha elections, the Congress won only 52 seats out of 543 parliamentary seats
 haalanki 2014 kii tulana main uske khate main is baar 8 siten (44 seat) zyada ain
 The vote share of the party also showed improvement
 is baar aam chunaav main congress kaa vot share 19
 5 percent, which was 2014 vote share (13
 6 fisadi) se zyada he
 In 2019, where the Congress was in the winner or runner-up position on 262 seats, in 2014 it stood first or second in 268 seats
 jabaki 10 saal pehle congress 350 siton par majboot sthiti main thi
 This time 11 states and 5 union territories (andhra Pradesh, Lakshadweep, Delhi, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand, Tripura, Sikkim, Rajasthan, Nagaland, Manipur, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Arunachal Pradesh) i could not even open an account
 rahul gandhi ko abhi bhi badi jeet kaa intjaar he (photo-manish rajput)pehali pariksha main hi fail2017 main congress adhyaksh par kabiz hone ke baad rahul gandhi kii badi pariksha gujarat or himachal pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav main party ko jeet dilaane kii thi, lekin lagaataar prayaas ke baad bhi vah gujarat se bijepi kii satta nahin jhatak sake or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke grih rajya main party lagaataar chhathi baar satta main pakad banaae rakhane main kaamyaab rahi
 Apart from Gujarat, the Congress lost its power in Himachal
 2018 main karnataka main bani number tu2018 main kai loksabhaa or vidhansabha siton par hue upachunaav ko chhod diya jaae to alag-alag maukon par 9 rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav lade gaye inamen se 4 rajyon main bijepi or congress ke bich aamane-saamne kii ladaai thi
 In the beginning of the year, Assembly elections were contested in Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland in February, in which the Congress lost power in Meghalaya, while its performance in 2 other states was disappointing
 iske kareeb 2 maheene baad dakshin bharat main congress ke ekmaatr garh karnataka main chunaav hue jahaan usne satta ganvaa di, lekin saajhe kii sarkaar main vah number 2 ho gai
 Assembly elections were held in Karnataka on May 12 in which the ruling Congress became the second party, but the Congress formed an alliance with the Janata Dal Secular (JDS) to prevent the BJP, which became the largest party, from taking over the power
 congress bhale hi bijepi ko sattarudh hone se rokane main kaamyaab ho gai, lekin uskaa bada nuksaan yah hua ki use gathbandhan main duusare number kii party banane ko majaboor hona padaa or mukhyamantri kaa pad ganvaa diya
 During this time there was tremendous political development and amidst doubt and crisis, this mixed government failed to complete its one year
 5 maheene pehle ai khushirahul gandhi ke party adhyaksh banane ke baad kai rajyon main haar kaa saamana karne vaali congress ke liye saal kaa ant thodaa sukhad rahaa kyonki november-disambar main 5 rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaav main 3 main jeet mili or party ke lagaataar haar ke silsile ko kuch der ke liye roak diya
 In Chhattisgarh, the Congress won a bumper victory by sweeping the BJP out of power
 rajasthan or madhya pradesh main bhi congress ko jeet mili lekin jaisi ummid thi vaisaa parinaam nahin rahaa
 Despite the anti-incumbency wave, the BJP once again performed well in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan except Chhattisgarh and could not return to power with a margin of just a few seats
 rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main satta main lautne ke kareeb 5 maheene baad hue loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko jis tarah se karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa usase yahi lagata he ki congress ko wo jeet mahaj ittefaq se mili thi
 In 2017, assembly elections were fought in 7 states, except in Punjab, in which the Congress lost in other states (goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat) before forming the government in 2 places in 2017
 punjab main congress ko jo jeet mili uskaa shrey bhi sthaneey netritv ko mila
 Despite being the largest party in Goa, the Congress lost its chance to form the government due to its sluggish attitude
 isi tarah manipur main bhi sabase badi party hone ke baavjood congress sarkaar banane kaa mauka chook gai or bijepi ke aakraamak tevar ke aage unki jeet kisi kaam na ai
 Assembly elections were held in March 2017 in Uttar Pradesh and in order to defeat the BJP in this election, Congress President Rahul Gandhi decided to contest the elections together in an unexpected alliance with the Samajwadi Party, but this alliance was defeated
 pradesh ke 403 siton par hue chunaav main bijepi ko 312 siten mili to congress ke khate main mahaj 7 siten hi ain, jabaki samjhaute ke tahat vah 105 siton par chunaav ladi thi
 Continuation of defeat in 2016, Assembly elections were held in 5 states in april-may in 2016, in which only the Union Territory of Puducherry was able to hold the Congress in power, while the party lost in the remaining four states
 assam main bijepi ne satta main pakad banaai to pashchim bengal mamata banerjee kii party trinmul congress (tiemasi) ne phir se satta main vaapasi kii
 While the CPI retained power by defeating the Congress-led coalition in Kerala, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) returned to power in Tamil Nadu, and the Congress was left waiting
 2015 main dilli main vidhansabha chunaav main congress khaataa kholane tak main naakaam rahi to bihar main congress janata dal united or rashtriya janata dal ke saath gathbandhan kar chunaav main utari or jeet hasil kii, lekin yah jeet zyada samay tak kaayam nahin rahaa or 2017 main janata dal united gathbandhan se alag ho gaya jisase congress rajya kii satta se baahar ho gai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has emerged as a mature leader in 2019 as compared to 2014, this time he definitely made him a bigger leader than he contested with seriousness and seriousness
 yah alag baat he ki unka netritv lagaataar sangharsh or prayaas ke baavjood voton main abhi tak badal paane main naakaam rahaa he or yahi unki sabase badi kamajori sabit hui
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, it tried to win the hearts of the people through a breathtaking scheme like justice, but this attempt also proved to be a failure
 agle saal rahul gandhi 50 baras ke ho jaaenge or ab dekhnaa hoga ki 5 saal baad 2024 main jab unki umr 54 saal kii ho jaaegi to kya vah us samay desh main hone vaale agle loksabhaa chunaav main party ko apni umr ke baraabar bhi seat dilaa paane main kaamyaab honge
 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi finally had to back down
 modi ne apni chuppi todate hue kaa he ki adwani hi hai endie ke piem in vatting
 The industry had advocated him to become PM, after which there was a stir in the party
 narendra modi apni party main chal rahi raajnneeti par kam hi bolte hai or agar bolte bhi hai to naap taul kar
 But if the PM raised the issue of waiting, he had to open his tongue
 darasal unke rajya main nivesh karne aae udyogpatiyon ne unhen piem in vatting bataaya tha or is baat par bijepi main bavaal much gaya
 The party high command made it clear that Delhi does not currently have a vacancy for Modi
 lihaaja modi ko saamne aakar adwani kaa gungan karnaa padaa
 The silence of these few days of Modi had put everyone in trouble
 ab bhaajapa ne raahat kii saans lee he
 Narendra Modi has decided that he will remain the CM
 piem in vatting kaa pad adwani ke liye he
 But this decision of Modi has made the question of who among Advani second generation leaders after Advani more complicated
 dilli kii 123 prime property upie sarkaar ne jate-jate vakf board ko de di
 Now the Modi government is investigating it
 kyonki jameen vakf ke naam hui nahin ki uski herapheri shuru ho jaati he
 Let us understand that Waqf and its scams co-waqf is an Arabic word, which means property that has been donated in the name of Allah
 taaki uskaa istemaal garibon kii bhalaai ke liye ho sake
 Waqf organizations have existed in India for 800 years
 shuruyaat hui muslim baadshahon dwaara daan kii gai jameenon kii dekhbhaal karne se
 The Waqf Board now has around three lakh registered properties in the country
 chaar lakh acre ke kareeb to jameen hi he
 Waqf has the maximum land after railways and defense
 lekin zyaadaatar property vivaadon main ghiri hui hai
 Bumblebees Board - Waqf Board scams are almost the same all over the country
 builder yaa bijnesaman vakf kii jameen kii pahchaan kar board memberon se sampark karte hai
 The land is sold at throwaway prices and the members get their share
 - jin rajyon main vakf kii jameen aasaani se nahin bik paati he, vahaan behad aasaan lij par inhen bilderon yaa kaarobaariyon ko saunp diya jaataa he
 Here also the board members get their share, as they make the rules of the lease in such a way that the property can be easily used commercially
 - desh main kai imaaraten, hotel, mal or factoriyaan vakf kii jameenon par khadi hai
 These lands were either sold at a very low price or provided at very low rent
 - ummid to yah kii jaati he ki vakf muslim samudaay ke kalyaan ke liye paison kaa intjaam karegaa, lekin deshbhar ke vakf board main aniyamitata or bhrashtachar kii bharmaar rahi he
 Accountability in this institution is minimal
 netaaon se gathjod- desh main philhal 30 vakf board hai
 There should be at least 5 members in any Waqf Board
 in sabhi sadasyon ko rajya sarkarein nominete karti hai
 That is, they join this board, which the government of that state wants
 - in board main vahi netaa sadsy ban pate hai, jinhen sarkaar main jagah nahin mil pai hoti he
 In such a situation, instead of doing anything special for the poor Muslim community, they always keep an eye on colluding with the land mafia or the encroachers
 - 1995 vakf act ke anusaar sabhi board kaa niyamit audit survey hona chahie, lekin kai sarkaron ne jaanboojhkar aisa nahin karaayaa
 Islam is in danger
 
 
 - jab bhi kabhi vakf board main vyaapt bhrashtachar kii jaanch ko lekar baat aati he to board sadsy akasar ye jumala doharaa dete hai- 'islam khatre main he'
 By saying this, they are protecting themselves
 - bhartiya puraatatv survey dwaara jin makbaron or majaaron kii dekharekh kii ja rahi he, unhen lekar vakf kaa apana daawa rahaa he, lekin in dharmik daavon ke peeche ladaai paison kii hi he
 Encourage encroachment
 
 
 - board khud hi kai smarakon kaa atikaraman karwaata he
 First Muslims are asked to read Namaz
 phir ise ibaadat kii jagah ghoshit karakar aasapaas bastiyon banavaa di jaati hai
 It becomes easy to sell or lease land near these illegal settlements
 in sab gadabadiyon kaa hi nateeja he ki aaj desh main vakf kii 70 fisadi property atikaraman kaa shikaar he
 All this is either due to the kindness of the waqf board members or by ignoring the governmental activities

 Neither Narendra Modi nor Rajnath Singh would have expected this
 magar kal tak utsaah main jhum rahi bijepi par vajrapaat ho chukaa he
 The party's prime ministerial candidate in the last Lok Sabha elections, the most senior leader LK Advani has resigned from all party posts
 party adhyaksh rajnath singh ko likhe khat main adwani ne kaha ki pichley kuch samay se main apane aap ko party main sahaj nahin paa rahaa hum
 i do not think that the party that Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Atal Bihar Vajpayee created, is the same party
 ye disha bhatak chuki he
 With this, Advani said that this letter should be considered my resignation
 adwani ne parliamentry board, rashtriya kaaryakarini or chunaav cameti ke padon se istipha diya he
 However, the stance on whether he will remain the chairman of NDA is not clear yet
 udhar endie ke sanyojak sharad yadav ne adwani ke istife par tippanee karte hue ishaara kiya ki ab unki party endie main bane rahane par nae sire se vichaar karegi
 Baqur Sharad Yadav, 'we were associated with Atal ji and Advani ji in NDA
 unheen ke saath or saamne saare samjhaute hue the
 Now it is not there, so we have to see what the road ahead is
 ’bijepi netritv kii aalochana karte hue sharad yadav ne kaha ki chunaav cameti kaa mukhiya koun banataa he, ye party kaa andruni maamla he, magar goa main netaaon ne jis tarah ke bayaan die hai, ve endie ke darshan ke khilaaf hai
 Sharad Yadav said that the decision on the future strategy would be taken only after consulting all the allies
 adwani ne ravivaar ko apane blog main shar shaiyya par lete bhishma pitamah kaa zikr kiya tha
 He also mentioned Krishna engaged in the war of religion
 tab se hi unke sanyas lene ke aakalnon kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya tha
 It was being told that soon after becoming the chairman of the Election Campaign Committee, Narendra Modi would come to Delhi to meet Advani
 rajnath singh bhi aaj hi dilli pahunche hai
 He denied the difference of opinion before the news of his resignation
 magar ab sab saamne aa gaya he
 Advani left the role of Sangh pracharak and took over the job of Jana Sangh in 1957
 tab vah rajasthan se dilli shift hue the or bataur saansad atal bihari vaajapeyi ko mili nivas main rahete the
 After the assassination of Deendayal Upadhyay, Atal came to the center of the Jana Sangh and Advani as his number two
 1980 main bhartiya janata party banane ke baad bhi satta kaa yahi kram bana rahaa
 It was only after the Ayodhya Rath Yatra from Advani's Somnath in 1989 that the BJP started reaching the lofty heights
 1984 ke chunaav main bijepi ke paas loksabhaa main do siten thim, magar 1989 main ye badhkar 88 ho gayi
 Then in 1991, the BJP formed governments in UP, MP, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh
 1995 main bataur adhyaksh adwani ne hi bijepi ke piem pratruashi ke taur par atal bihari vaajapeyi ke naam kaa elaan kiya tha
 Advani always remained the Home Minister during Vajpayee's rule in power
 2002 main unhen uppradhanmantri banaaya gaya
 Read related news: Sushma is confident, will convince Advani that in 2005 Advani had to leave the post of BJP president due to comments on Jinnah
 
 
 to yah he modi or bijepi kaa game planbijepi main do-faad ho chuki he: congresmodi ko mili kaman, adwani kaa istipha said effectah congress US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will negotiate with the Pakistani leadership in Islamabad to pressure them to end the Haqqani network to facilitate the peace process in neighboring Afghanistan
 rajanyik sutron ne kaha ki hillari ke saath siie pramukh general david petros or joint chinas of staff general martin denpasi bhi maujuud hai
 He said that Hillary would hold meetings with the country's civil and military leadership, including Pak President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and Army Chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani
 hillari kaa yah daura aise samay ho rahaa he, jab america-pakistan rishton kaa str bahut neeche chalaa gaya he
 In fact, senior US officials had alleged that the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI was using the Haqqani network to continue the war in Afghanistan and attack US and foreign forces
 afghanistan-pakistan seemaa par america tathaa afgaan balon kii tainaati sambandhi khabaron ke baad general kayaani ne america ko kabaili ilaake main kisi ekatarfa karrwai ke prati chetaya tha
 The region is considered to be the intelligence base of the Haqqani network and other terrorist organizations
 kayaani ne buudhvaar ko do sansadeey samitiyon ke sadasyon ko bataaya tha ki pakistan parmaanu shakti he, jisaki tulana iraq yaa afghanistan se nahin kii ja sakati
 He said that the US would have to think 10 times before taking any unilateral action in Pakistan

 You must have heard that you leave with you at bad times
 aisa hi kuch gujarat ke nilambit ipies adhikari di
 Yes
 vanjaaraa ke saath bhi hua
 When he realized this, he sent a resignation letter of 10 pages
 unke istife ke masaude ne narendra modi ke kandhon par padi ateet kii potli kaa boj or badha diya
 Vanzara has accused the Chief Minister in his resignation submitted to the Additional Chief Secretary (home) that he had implicated loyal police officers of the state in a fake encounter, but saved his close friend Amit Shah
 jaisi ummid thi, bijepi ke pravaktaa modi kaa bachaav kar rahe hai, lekin party ke bheetar jo gut pradhanmantri pad par unki ummidavaari kaa virodh kar rahaa tha, use badi khuraaq mil gai he
 Legally, this can also cause trouble for Modi
 sutron kaa kahana he ki vanjaaraa kii chitthee ko court se baahar aparaadh kaa kaboolnamaa mana jayega or iske liye kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ko nae sire se unase poochtacha kerani hogi
 "so far, Vanzara has not asked for an apology, but he has a choice," says a senior lawyer associated with the case
 unke bayaan ko dand prakriya samhita (siarpisi) kii dhara 164 ke tahat kisi magistrate ke saamne darj kiya ja saktaa he
 They can become government witnesses, entitled to be pardoned, provided they give full details of their crime
 ” iskaa matlab hoga ki mukhyamantri modi is maamle main shah kii tarah aaropee ban sakate hai
 Shah was the Home Minister of Gujarat from 2003 to 2010
 2005 main soharabuddin shaikh ke saath uski patni kausar bi or ek gavaah tulsiram prajapati ko farji muthbhed main maare jane ke maamle main ve mukhya aaropee the
 Accused in the murder, extortion and kidnapping case, Shah was arrested in 2010 and released on bail within three months
 lekin chah saal se jail main band vanjaaraa kaa daawa he ki police adhikari to sirf ''field officer” the jo 'niti nirmaataa’ modi or shah ke adeshon kaa paalan kar rahe the
 Vanzara, once Modi's trusted officer, is accused in all four cases of fake encounters in Gujarat — Sohrabuddin, Prajapati, Ishrat Jahan and Sadiq Jamal — between 2003 and 2006
 in maamalon kii jaanch sibiai kar rahi he
 He accused Shah of betraying the police officers who sacrificed themselves for the security of the country
 ” unhone shah par mukhyamantri ko gumraah karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 Vanzara's frustration is clearly visible in the letter
 is chitthee ne modi kheme main ghabrahat paidaa kar di he
 Although Modi is silent and has not responded to these allegations against him, his supporters are worried that this letter will lead to a flood of revelations and accusations
 isse rajya main alag-alag muthbhedon main aropit or jail main band 32 duusare police adhikariyon ko bhi munh kholane kaa bahaanaa mil jayega
 If this happens, Modi and Shah's troubles will increase
 modi ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki vanjaaraa kaa gussa thanda karne kii koshishen ho rahi hai
 According to sources, "vanzara will complete seven years of imprisonment without filing a charge sheet
" saat saal ke baad court ke liye unhen jamaanat dene se inkaar karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 They can be explained to be patient
 saath hi unke parivaar kaa khyaal rakhane kaa vaada bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Not only police officers are annoyed by Modi's policy of "use and sweep"
 party main bhi bahut-se log unase us vakt bahut khafa the, jab modi ke aagrah par march main shah ko dilli main party mahasachiv banaakar laayaa gaya tha or baad main unhen uttar pradesh jaise mahatvapurn rajya kaa prabharee bana diya gaya
 a state that can decide Modi's fate in 2014
 rajdhani main modi or shah kii jodi jis tarah duusare sadasyon ko darkinar karke apana dabadabaa kaayam karne main lagi thi, usase party ke varisht netaaon main kaaphi naaraazgi thi
 "these issues will make it difficult for Modi," says a leader who is angry with Modi in the party
 2002 main godhra ke baad ab yah badi pareshaani khadi ho gai he
 Modi's past is following him
 yah sirf kanoonee maamla bhar nahin he
 Will it allow him to sit on the supreme chair of the country? "another BJP leader says," This has come as a big blow to Modi's image of a clever strategist in politics and a warrior for the country's security
 amit shah par unka jarurat se zyada nirbhar rahanaa nuksaandeh hoga
 a leader should not depend on one person by ignoring others
 jo log modi kaa gungan karte the, unka bhram tuutata ja rahaa he
 For example, Vanzara, who considers Modi his god, says that Modi could not support him at the time of need under Shah's influence
 ” andruni logon kaa kahana he ki shah party main akele aise netaa hai, jo modi ke dimag or unki rajnatik ranneeti ko puri tarah samajhate hai, isiilie ve modi ke liye aprihaary ban gaye
 After Vanzara's letter, Shah is soon going to be a burden for Modi
 vanjaaraa or shaayad duusare police adhikariyon ke man main asantosh ke beej november, 2012 main hi pad gaye the, jab shah ke vakil ram jethmalani ne supreme court ko bataaya ki rajya main shah ke pravesh par lage do saal ke pratibandh ko agar hataa liya jaae to maamle kii sunwaayee gujarat se baahar kiye jane main shah ko koi aapatti nahin he
 After this, Shah was allowed to enter his home state, but 32 jailed officers were removed from Ahmedabad and sent to Taloja Jail in Maharashtra
 baad main supreme court ne mukademe kii sunwaayee usee rajya main tay kar di
 This sent a message to these closed police officers that Modi wanted to keep his interests at bay in order to get Shah back in Gujarat
 shah ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki police adhikariyon ko uksaane main congress ke logon kaa haath ho saktaa he
 Keeping the Lok Sabha elections in mind, Congress strategists are busy trying every trick
 shah ko is baat ke liye pehle se hi saavdhaan ho janaa chahie tha ki congress ke ranneetikaar jail main band police adhikariyon par fanda phenk sakate hai
 They can be used against Modi and him
 andeh tabhi jaahir kiye ja rahe the, jab haal hi main ishrat jahaan maamle main jamaanat paa chuke ipies girish singhl samet gujarat police ke chaar adhikari is maamle main modi sarkaar ke khilaaf sabooton kaa khulaasa karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye the
 Significantly, in the Sohrabuddin case on January 12, 2010, there were allegations of bias regarding the order of CBI inquiry
 sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh dene vaale do jajon main se ek tarun chatarji ko do din baad ritair hona tha
 Incidentally, the day he gave this order, he was appointed as the chairman of the Border Disputes Tribunal on behalf of the Center
 duusare jaj aftab alam ko unke ritair hone ke teen maheene ke bheetar hi is saal ke shuru main telecom disputes setlement and apillet tribunel (tidseti) kaa cheirperson bana diya gaya
 Vanzara's letter to the Congress, somehow waiting for Modi to get trapped, has given a face-off
 congress netaa renuka choudhary ne media se kaha, ''agar asaram ko giraftaar kiya ja saktaa he to vanjaaraa ke khulaase ke baad farji muthbhed ke maamle main modi ko kyon nahin giraftaar kiya ja saktaa?” modi ke khilaaf jis tarah gade murde ukhd rahe hai, usase congress main josh kii lahar daudaahe lagi he
 He is getting issues against Modi easily without any effort
 darasal, ajay maakan ke tahat congress kaa media vibhaag 2 or 3 sitambar ko puri tarah sakriy ho gaya jab ek freelans jarnlist ne 2 sitambar ko supreme court main janhit yachika main aarope lagaaya ki bijepi saansad prakaash jaavdekar or bhupendra singh yadav ne prajapati farji muthbhed maamle main jaanch ko prabhavit karne kii koshish kii thi
 The journalist also submitted the CD to the Supreme Court in support of his charge
 congress kii media team ne 10, pandit pant maarg par maakan ke ghar par sidi ko baariki se dekha or phir modi par nishaanaa saadhane kaa faisla kiya
 In Maken's words, "the facts that come out of watching the CD are very serious and important
" yah nishpaksh nyaayik jaanch ko prabhavit karne kii koshish he
 The CBI should investigate the matter and Modi should not continue in his post until the investigation is complete
 unhen istipha de dena chahie
 "however, this matter did not catch much uproar in the media, so when Vanzara's resignation came, the Congress did not have a one-time confidence in its fate
 maakan ne apane sahyogiyon ke saath is chitthee ko do ghante tak baariki se padhaa or usamen se kuch khaas binduon ko uthaakar apana bayaan taiyaar kiya
 He took 9 September on 3 September
 15 baje apane ghar par media ko sambodhit kiya
 He said, "it is happening in Mahatma Gandhi's state that 32 police officers are in jail for human rights violations and encounter cases
" unamem se chah to ipies adhikari hai
 a case is going on against six other IPS officers
 ” gujarat sarkaar se safai maangate hue unhone ek baar phir se modi kaa istipha maanga
 With Modi on the defensive, the Congress has decided to keep the pressure on its side
 loksabhaa chunaavon main salbhar se bhi kam samay rah gaya he, aise main modi or congress ke bich ladaai or bhi tikhi or bhaddi ho sakati he
 Despite all the scams and corruption allegations against it, the Congress has mastered the art of defending itself
 desh kii sabase oonchi kursi par nigahen tikaae modi ko use pachhadgaye ke liye abhi or dam-kham dikhaane kii jarurat hogi

 This will give the military government legitimacy to join the election
 pradhanmantri prayuth chaan-ocha ne agle saal chunaav karwaane kaa vaada kiya he
 Priyutha led the 2014 coup
 kai hastiyon ne chunaa 'haa'matdaan kii prakriya puri hone ke baad janamat sangrah ke parinaamon kii ghoshnaa kii jaaegi
 Prime Minister Prayuth and other prominent government figures had openly announced a few days ago that they would opt for 'yes' by voting in today's referendum
 tay hoga desh kaa bhavishyasaal 2014 main takhtapalat ke baad satta sanbhaalane vaali sena junta ne desh kii ‘raajnneeti ko saaf’ karne ke liye desh kaa samvidhan dobaaraa likhane kaa aahvaan kiya tha
 The referendum may prove to be a defining day in Thai politics
 iske jariye na sirf navarchit samvidhan kaa bhavishya tay hoga, balki iskaa parinaam sena dwaara gathit neshnal council for pis and order jaisi kai ikaayiyon or vibhinn dalon ke netaaon ke liye bhi mahatvapurn sabit ho saktaa he
 Opposition to the referendum Even if the constitution is not approved in this referendum, there is uncertainty about what will happen, but the military government will remain in control
 sainya adhikari jis tarah se janamat sangrah karvaa rahe hai, maanavadhikaar samooh uski ninda karte rahe hai
 Because it prohibits campaigning
 jiske chalate darjanon logon ko hiraasat main liya gaya he or unpar aarope tay kiye gaye hai
 The result is that there is limited information about the draft of the constitution among the people
 sainya sarkaar ne vaada kiya he agar ise manjuur kar liya jaataa he to agle saal chunaav ho sakate hai, jisase loktantric sarkaar behaal ho jaaegi lekin aalochakon kii daleel he ki masavida sainya niyantran ko sthai banaae rakhega kyonki bhavishya main chuni jane vaali sarkaron ko lekar nirnaayak prabhaav sainya balon or niyukt seenet ke haath main hi rahegaa

 samaajawaadee party main kabje kii ladaai ke bich lakhanu offis main nayaa nemplate lag gaya he
 In this, a new plate of Akhilesh Yadav 'national President' has been planted after Mulayam Singh's name
 gauratlab he ki akhilesh gut or pita mulaayam ke samarthakon ke bich party or simbel par kabje kaa maamla chunaav ayog main lambit he
 Both groups have claimed control over the party
 akhilesh gut kaa daawa he ki unke paksh main do-tihaai bahumat he
 While the Mulayam group claims that the president is still Netaji
 party main bade tanaav ke bich 1 janvari ko akhilesh gut ne rashtriya adhiveshan bulaakar akhilesh yadav ko rashtriya adhyaksh ghoshit kar diya tha
 Describing it as illegal, the Mulayam group went to the Election Commission
 is bich, somvaar ko mulaayam singh apane bete akhilesh par janakar barase
 Mulayam met party workers on Monday morning
 kuch kaaryakarta rote hue bole- netaji party bachaa lijie
 On this Mulayam said- i tried a lot, Akhilesh does not listen to me
 koi ise mulaayam kaa vidaai bhaashan kah rahaa tha to koi shivpal ke kaale jaadu kaa asar lekin ek baat saafe ho gai ki ab party karyaalay main maujuud kaaryakarta mulaayam kii sunne ko taiyaar nahin the or mulaayam ke bhaashan ke baad to sab saafe ho gaya ki akhilesh ke kaaryakarta ab mulaayam ke virodh karne main bhi peeche nahin rahenge
 The workers opposed Mulayam as soon as Mulayam walked out of the party office, Mulayam Singh's protest started and the workers started cursing him, many workers started crying and weeping and appealed to save the party and Symbol
 mulaayam ne jaise hi kaha ki maine apni ore se kai koshish kii or akhilesh sunne tak ko taiyaar nahin he, ab chunaav ayog main ham donon aamane-saamne hai hamen koi bhi faisla manjuur hoga, aap se apil he ki aap hamaara saath den
 Many activists started crying and even opposed Mulayam Singh
 mulaayam kaa ye bolnaa tha ki kaaryakarta khadey hokar akhilesh ko aashirwad dene kii apil karne lage lekin mulaayam singh ne unhen chup karakar baitha diya, kai kaaryakarta jo bich-bich main bolte rahe
 The beginning started at 12 o'clock in the day when Mulayam left his 5 Vikramaditya Marg at around 12 o'clock in the middle of the day and started the party office but stumbled into the office and turned the car to Shivpal's house, about 5 minutes meeting
 After Mulayam again entered the party office with lav-lashkar, headed straight to the auditorium where hundreds of supporters were already seated
 vahaan maujuud kaaryakartaaon ko laga ki mulaayam shaayad kuch bada elaan karenge lekin mulaayam ne bataa diya ki wo nahin jhukenge
 Mulayam said, "I don't listen to me
 Akhilesh Mulayam Singh Yadav told the party workers that they have removed big leaders from the party, sacked Balaram Yadav
 What was the mistake of Balaram, i had made Balarama a minister forcibly
" mulaayam ne kaha ki omprakash or naarad raay ko nikaal diya
 Ambika Chaudhary was fired, fired such big leaders, what a mistake it was, they also removed the woman minister
 mulaayam ne kaha ki ab chunaav ayog main chaar baje tak hoga faisalaa court tak jaayegaa maamla akhilesh ko kai baar milane bulaayaa lekin vah kuch sunne ko taiyaar nahin, akhilesh ne jo kiya he usase massej musalmaan virdohi gaya he
 Akhilesh Yadav was called since morning but did not come
 unhone kaha ki subah bhi phone kiya tha usko main jo bhi baat karata hum usko ramgopal ko bataa detaa he ki hamaari sarkaar banegi to alpsankhyak ke liye kaam karuunga usne bura maanane vaali nahin he
 He said that the DGP listens to what he is, Akhilesh did not want to make him, it is the DGP who had written against us in the CBI, but we had forgiven him
 akhilesh hamaara betaa he lekin hamako nahin maaloom tha ki wo virodhiyon se mil jayega, akhilesh ram gopal ke kehane paat kaam karata he
 He calls us only on his request, now Symbol is neither in our hands nor in Akhilesh's hands
 aap log hamaara saath denchunaav ayog somvaar ko hi faisalaa karegaa, jo bhi faisalaa aae ham chaahate hai ki aap log hamaara saath den
 Now Akhilesh does not listen to us, we have put our claim in the Election Commission with our lawyers regarding the election symbol
 un logon ne bhi apni baat rakhi he lekin party hamane banaaya he, party kaa rashtriya adhyaksh main hum to chunaav chinh ham hi ko milegaa
 Mulayam said that once again i am appealing to you to come with me, we have worked for the minorities
 ayodhya maamle main hamane inkaa paksh rakhaa tha, ab akhilesh ko sochna padegaa kii apane pita kaa saath de yaa ramgopal kaa, ramgopal virodhiyon ke kehane par chal rahaa he
 Mulayam said that we will form a majority government again and minorities will be taken care of

 bhartiya captain viraat kohli ne jasprit bumraah ko ‘duniya kaa sarvshereshth (tej) gendbaaj’ qaraar diya or saath hi kaha ki perth ke oochaal bhare wicket par vah bhi uskaa saamana karte hue darate
 Bumrah took a total of nine wickets for 86 runs in the third Test, which helped India beat Australia by 137 runs to take an unassailable 2-1 lead in the four-match series
 test cricket main apane debyue saal main 48 wicket chatakaane vaale bumraah kii tarif karte hue kohli ne kaha, ‘mere anusaar jasprit duniya kaa sarvshereshth gendbaaj he
 He is the match winner, no doubt, even though he has been playing (test cricket) for just 12 months
 ’kohli ne kaha, ‘mere kehane kaa matlab he ki agar perth jaisi pich he to eemaandaaree se kahuun to main jasprit bumraah kaa saamana nahin karnaa chahta kyonki agar vah lay main aa gaya to aapako dhwast kar saktaa he
 The way he bowls is very different from any other bowler and i think he feels it more than the batsman
 yahi kaaran he ki vah apane kaushal ko lekar itnaa aashwast he
 After the Melbourne victory, these veterans congratulated Team India on Twitter, saying that Bumrah's outstanding fitness and honesty for work, apart from his skills, he and head coach Ravi Shastri took him seriously before the tour of South Africa
 Thought
 bhartiya captain kaa maananaa he ki bumraah paristhitiyon se khijane kii jagah pradarshan karne kii maansikta ke saath utarataa he jo unhen match vijeta banaata he
 The captain said, "his mindset makes him different from other bowlers in the world right now
" vah pich ko dekhtaa he or yah nahin sochataa ki in viketon par kaaphi mashkkat kerani hogi
 He thinks how do i get wickets for the team and your mindset sets you apart from the rest
 ’ captain ne khulaasa kiya ki gendbaaji ranneeti mukhya rup se gendbaaj swayan banaate hai or captain ke rup main vah tabhi apni baat rakhte hai jab ‘plan bi’ kii jarurat ho
 Try removing kohli-pujara from Team India, it will be like us: Penun said, 'to be honest, i usually just sit and listen in the bowlers' meeting
 yah samajhnaa behad mahatvapurn he ki gendbaaj kya soch rahe hai or is prakriya ke dauraan aap paalan b par kaam karte ho or aap gendbaajon ko is bare main bataate ho
 This is how we work
 ’ bumraah ke saakshaatkaar main bhi dekhne ko mila ki kis tarah team sabase pehle aati he
 Kohli said, 'even Bumrah's interview about the match was about how i can contribute to the team
 perth main use wicket nahin mili or usne yahaan jis tarah gendbaaji kii vah dikhaata he ki vah maayoos nahin hota or use pataa he ki kabhi naa kabhi wicket milenge
 ' pehali baar 'pariksha par charchaa' kaarykram ke jariye chaatro se sidhaa samvaad kar rahe pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bacchon ke parents kii jamkar class lee
 Actually, the way the students across the country questioned the expectations of the parents, they felt that they are upset with them
 chaatro ne poocha- har mata-pita doctor yaa ejeeniyar hi bananaa chaahate hai
 Don't think about what we are interested in
 kya ye sahi he? jisapar modi ne kaha ki 'lagata he mujhe aaj parents kii class lagaani padegi'
 In 'making Exam Fun: Chat with PM Modi' in Delhi, the Prime Minister said, the question is not about students
 maa-baap bhi kuch isi tarah ke sawaal kar rahe hai ki bacchon ko samajhaaon
 Their mindset is not right
 modi ne kaha- mata-pita par shaq karnaa band karen
 They spend their lives for you
 sweekaar kar chalaanaa chahie ki parents kaa sapana hota he apane bachche ko kuch banate dekhne kaa
 Do not doubt their loyalty
 bharosa hone par aapasi samaj kaa rasta khul hi jaataa he
 LIVE: PM Modi's 'discussion on exam' starts, giving questions to students, advising the students, the Prime Minister said, "do not study after seeing parents
" tanaavpurn vaataavaran tabaahi kar detaa he
 It happens to many fathers that they want to transplant their dreams into children
 maa-baap kabhi-kabhi apane bacchon kii kshamta or parvarish dekhe bina unamem khud ke adhure sapane puraa hone kii ichha paal lete hai
 Modi called it the ghost of desires
 kaha- wo bhoot aapako jakad lete hai
 To avoid this, when the father is in a good mood, talk to him openly
 modi ne chutki lete hue kaha, bharat kaa baccha janmajaat netaa hota he
 Children take out their work for their needs
 unhen maaloom he ki maa, daadi, bhai yaa bahan kiske jariye kaam nikaalnaa he
 Once the sister has made up her mind, the father does not have the strength to refuse
 yahi baat hoti he hamaare pariwaron main
 For the first time, with the 10 crore students and teachers of 6 lakh schools, the Prime Minister's discussion on the examination, Salamodi said to the parents, i will tell the parents who have made it the social status that my son will do it, others will and i did If not, then i am not able to show my mouth - close it
 modi ne kaha, samaaj main pita kisi or bachche kii katha sunakar ghar aate hai or man main sochate hai ki mere bachche bekaar hai
 Scold your wife - what have you taught your children? ghar pahunchaate hi aap mil gaye saamne to khel khatm
 The children asked these questions on the education exam, Modi did not give these answers to social status
 Modi said, i tell the parents that you do not make these things social status aapke bete ke andar jo samarthy he usee kii charchaa kiijie
 Do not see it with the power of others
 har bachche main kuch khaas hota he
 Do not impose borrowed things on it
 bacchon par dabaav na daalen
 Number is not life
 kya ek pariksha hi jindagi he? aap kalam ko dekh lijie
 He wanted to become the pilot of the fighter plane
 fail ho gaye
 Did they fail No, the country got a great scientist
 modi ne kaha, isliye dusron ke bachche dekhakar apane bacchon se moolyankan or apeksha nahin karnaa chahie
 Should talk to children
 parivaar main ek khulaapan or tandurust vaataavaran rahanaa chahie
 We also have it in the scriptures that if a son and daughter are 18 years old, they should be considered friends
 bataa den ki dilli ke talkator stadium main deshbhar ke kareeb 10 karod chaatr-adhyapakon ko video conferencing ke jariye joda gaya
 During the program, Modi gave the children answers to their questions and many tips regarding the exam
 cricket world cap kii shuruyaat 1975 main hui thi
 One-day cricket was then new and the cricketers were known to play Tests
 tab 60 overon kaa vanade match hua karata tha
 The first match of the first World Cup was played between India and England and the batting made by India's great batsman Sunil Gavaskar in this match is still remembered as the most controversial innings of ODI cricket
 lords main khelaa gaya muqabla7 june 1975 ko yah match cricket ke makka kahe jane vaale lords main khelaa gaya
 Then the summer season was going on and England played a big score of 334 for four in 60 overs
 yah us samay vanade cricket kaa sabase bada score bhi tha
 In England's innings, Dennis Amis (137) contributed a century and Keith Fletcher (68) contributed a half-century
 iske baad kris old ne keval 30 gedon par shandaar pachaasa jadaa
 There were then eight teams in the tournament that were placed in two groups, ie a defeat would further weaken the chances of the next round
 ye to sabhi maan kar chal rahe the ki bharat pehla match haar chukaa he lekin tab toornament kaa formet ye tha ki agle daur (semifinal) main jane ke liye agar kisi do tiimon ke ank baraabar rahenge to jis team kaa net ran rate acha hoga wo aage jaaegi
 That is, India will have to try to score as many runs despite defeat
 bharat ne khelaa tha world cap ke itihaas kaa pehla match, ye rahaa tha natijagavaskar ne kheli aisi pari, field par daudte hue aae phansabhartiya pari kii shuruyaat karne vaale sunil gavaskar to us din bas apni hi dhun main the
 He started playing odis like a test
 bhartiya darshakon main niraashaa failane lagi
 They were constantly being played at a slow pace and the resentment of the Indian spectators increased so much that some of them even came running towards them and ran against them
 udhar pavilion main baithe gavaskar kii team ke saathiyon ke chehre par bhi niraashaa saaf jhalak rahi thi
 Interestingly, Gavaskar played 174 balls in this innings and could score 36 runs without being dismissed
 unka strike rate 20
 Remained 69
 unki is pari kii badaulat team india ne 3 wicket ke nuksaan par keval 132 ran hi bana saki or 202 ranon se match ganvaa diya
 This became the World Cup record for losing matches with such a big difference that remained for the next 27 years
 gavaskar kii is pari ke peeche kya tha karanus samay team india ke manager jies ramchand ne daily express newspaper se kaha, ‘maine aaj tak jitne bhi match dekhe unamem se yah sabase sharmnaak pradarshan he
 He said that the wicket was too slow for the shot
 lekin england ne isi pich par 334 ran banaae to aisa kahana bevakoofi he
 There is disappointment in the team
 desh kii pratishtha bahut mahatvapurn he jise is tarah nahin ganvaaya ja saktaa
 'it was understood by some that after the England innings that the Indian team had agreed that they could not win and in the last match played at Lord's before the entire team was dismissed for 42, then probably the team cheaply She wanted to avoid being dismissed
 world cap main records ke shikhar par hai sachin, ab tak koi aasapaas bhi nahingavaskar kii is pari ke baad garm ho gaya tha afvaahon kaa bazaravahin is pari ke baad afvaahon kaa bazaar bhi garm ho gaya ki gavaskar team ke chayan se naakhush the
 For the World Cup, the selection committee preferred spinners over fast bowlers and this was the reason for Gavaskar's displeasure as the spinners had failed miserably in the previous England tour
 ek or afvaah yah bhi thi ki wo venkatraghavan ke captain chune jane se naakhush the
 Gavaskar did not say anything publicly about this innings at that time, but after many years he also believed that it was the worst innings of his life, but at the same time he reasoned it to be 'out of form'
 gavaskar ne kaha ki match ke dauraan unhone out hone kii koshish bhi kii lekin out nahin ho sake
 Other teammates also expressed surprise at Gavaskar's innings and when Gavaskar arrived in the dressing room after the match, no fellow players even spoke to him
 kya gavaskar sach main out of form the?england ke khilaaf is pradarshan ke baavjood gavaskar ko aglaa match khilne kaa mauka diya gaya
 The match was played against East Africa just four days after the match against England and in this Gavaskar scored 65 runs in 86 balls and then 12 runs in 14 balls against New Zealand in the last league match
 jab team laut kar bharat ai to manager ne bhi is pari kii report board se kii lekin board ne gavaskar ko aadhikarik taur par kuch nahin kaha
 With this, the whole matter ended

 Always available to write anything agam-bagdam
 ''rajdhani dilli se pichley 13 saal se vyangy yatra naam kii patrika nikaal rahe or ek darjan se zyada vyangy pustakon / sangrahon ke lekhak prem janamejay chaturvedi ke bazaarwaad vaale pahalu ko thodaa or vistaar dete hai
 Expressing concern, he says, "the way marketism is buying up our language, identity and mindset is a matter of serious concern
" ''asal main vyangy main taatkalikta banaam saarvkalikta bahes kaa ek bada pahalu rahi he
 Chaturvedi, the top satirist of Hindi, has been closely observing the trends of writing and satirism for the last three decades
 is pahalu ko ve thodaa apane andaaj main vistaar dekar samajhaate hai, ''vyangy rachana kaa sthaan badha bhi he or gata bhi
 Now see that the first to write poetry was street-street
 gaanvon main ab bhi hai
 Actually, it has happened that now poets too started writing satire
 pehle vyangy kaa spes kam tha
 Sharad (joshi) ji used to write daily, (harishankar) Parsai ji used to write
 dhire-dhire vyangy ne jarurat or maang ke anuroop akmodet (samavisht) karne kii koshish kii yahi galat kiya
 Satire was limited to instant comments
 ab sampadak rachana kaushal nahin maang rahaa, use contemparari chahie, taatkaalik
 Bad composition will also work
 chapana hi rachana kii quality he
 a cardiologist by profession, Chaturvedi in the world of Hindi literature is a satirist of the thought-provoking tradition of Srilal Shukla, Sharad Joshi, Harishankar Parsai, Ravindra Nath Tyagi and Manohar Shyam Joshi
 yah pahalu gauratlab he ki chota or chota karne ke dabaavon main bhi ve apni style main jagah lekar likhte aa rahe hai
 His ever-growing popularity is due to the fact that several versions of his satirical novels Baramasi, Narakayatra and Marichika have arrived
 narkayatra ke to das se zyada sanskaran chape hai
 Chaturvedi, who avoided being loud, is known for his outspokenness
 tabhi to ve kehete hai, ''maine arundhati roy kaa bhi likhaa hua padhaa he or mujhe lagata he ki unase oonche nahin to neeche bhi nahin he meraa likhaa hua
 Had i been writing in English, i would have got Rs 1 crore
 advance milte
 Writing in Hindi is like opening a laundry shop in the city of Nango
 '' hindi lekhan ke arthshaastra par thodaa or roshni daalate hue ve kehete hai ki kabhi kuch puraskaron se bhale lakh ru

 shuddh fantasy main or vyangy upanyaas kii vidha se bilkul alag dhang se paagalakhaana unhone do saal lagakar likhaa he
 Even editing six drafts
 aakhri chah maheene to unhone is par roj 6-7 ghante kharch kiye hai
 The increasing interference of marketism continued to haunt them
 unheen ke shabdon main, ''apane lekhon main main is par likh to rahaa tha lekin mujhe baar-baar lagata tha ki puri baat kah nahin paaya hum
 a story came to my mind that if my country starts thinking like marketism then what will be the scene
 lokkala, sangeet sab vahi chal rahaa, jise bazaar promot kar rahaa he
 Thought, behavior, culture, literature are all governing the market
 bazaar to sabaki jarurat he par bazaarwaad galat he
 These things scared me
 maine ise ek viraat paagalakhaane kii tarah liya he
 "one aspect in the debate also emerges that now what is written and what is not, the freedom of choice has not been left to the satirist
 naarad kii chintaa, maalish mahapurana or haashie kaa raag vyangy sangrahon ke lekhak susheel siddharth ise samaaj kii ghatati sahansheeltaa se jodakar dekhte hai
 In his own words, "tolerance is such that today it has become difficult to write on politicians by name
" yahi haal saamaajik or dharmik kshetra kaa bhi he
 If you write with your name, then the editor will refuse to print
 yani aisa kuch likhnaa he ki bagbaan bhi khush rahe, raji rahe sayyad bhi
 The Puranic adds another aspect to it
 ve kehete hai ki pehle bazaarwaad par likhte hue ham coca cola or pepsy cola kaa naam lekar tanj kasate the, koi aitraaj nahin karata tha
 Now the editors already say that do not write on such and such brands because they are sponsors of the game as well as advertisers
 sawaal uthta he ki akhabaaron ke liye to joshi, parasaai or shukla ne bhi likhaa lekin apane kathy main unhone kabhi koi samjhauta nahin kiya
 Rather his style and frankness remained, as well as his popularity
 parasaai ne to pandit nehru se lekar siyasat, dharm, samaaj ke bade netaaon main se shaayad hi kisi ko bakchasha ho
 Actually, a big condition of satirical writing is courage
 in lekhakon ke is vidha main agua banane kii yahi vajah thi ki ve kisi bhi vyakti, satta yaa vyavastha se ratti bhar bhi ghabaraate nahin the
 By the way, Chaturvedi does not agree with this aspect as much
 parasaai par ek baar hamalaa hone kii baat unhen yaad he par use ve apwaad ke rup main hi lete hai
 They believe that restrictions were in place earlier, but now they are a bit more
 lekin unke man main ek vichaar agar aayaa he or vah jenuin he to ve kahkar rahenge kyonki dar kaa to koi ant hi nahin he
 He says, "the Madhya Pradesh government had sent my name for the Padma Shri in 2015
 tabhi maine ek vyangy likhaa ki taanashaah ab ek popular leader or garibon ke maseehaa ke chole main aa saktaa he
 Wherever it was printed, the editor of it also touched the face of Narendra Modi
 bhopal main mere ek parichit ne kaha ki ab agar is tarah se likhoge to bhul jaao padmashri
 But i got the award
 ab asal main logon kii khaal moti ho gai he
 i would never personally attack anyone anyway
 ek pravriti par baat karata hum
 And to that i don't think there is any danger
 '' siddharth bhi is par sahmati jataate hai ki agar vyangyakaar main saahas nahin he to vah uske likhe hue main saaf dikhaai degaa
 "if you are hesitant, words will leave you
" vahaan to kabir aapako rasta dikhaate hai ki is dharti par darana kisase bande?''bahes ke daayre main vyangy kii style bhi he
 The composition of an author brings with him a craft
 lekin idhar teji se ubhare kai lekhakon kaa rachaa hua, ek hi colony ke makaan jaisaa lagata he
 Chaturvedi says that "the people writing letters to the editor started writing satire and they started living in the illusion they had created
" vyangy ke texchar ko samajhe bagaiyr vyangy likhaa ja rahaa he
 "siddharth, whose satirical novel Tamashiban and the satirical drama Endless Coming Soon, seems to be missing ideas from satire
" ''jab aap ghatnaon kaa vishleshan karte hai to vichaar aate hai
 You are not doing that because you have to study and observe a lot for analysis
 subah khyaal aayaa ki likhnaa chahie
 Humorously, got sarcastic
 vyangy main reporting ho rahi he
 "janmejaya feels that" This is not the time of Lalu Yadav type
 ab to amit shah kii shatranji chaal ko samajhane ke liye bada dimag chahie
 Chaturvedi is of the opinion that satire is in ultimatally content and it is going to end
 parasaai or joshi ek-dedh pare main hi itnaa gaharaa kuch likh dete the ki vah puure jivan par coment ho jaataa tha
 The Puranic points to a basic aspect as they come to the point, "if you want to write a satire, you have to read Karl Manns, Osho and Lohia
" tabhi aap apane desh or samaaj ko thik se jaan or phir likh sakenge
 "that is, you will be able to fill the ocean in Gagar
" varanaa! jhakh maarthe rahiye

 Manoj Kumar Jhayah Kitab Yogphal is a new poetry collection of famous poet Arun Kamal
 unhone apane shuruaati sangrahon main hi apni kavy-bhashaa arjeet kar lee thi, jo kisi bhi kavi ke liye vaanchhneeya lekin durlabh he
 From his first collection of his only edge, he has been raising big questions of life in poems
 unhone hindi kavita ke vaakya-swabhaav or kathy-swabhaav ko kaaphi—kuch badla he
 In the poem Yogaphal of this collection, the poet wishes to have a fervent appendage on the various appearances of the world - from Vajra, Vyaghra to the dead body
 ye panktiyaan dekhie—kabhi kabhi main us vajra kii tarah laganaa chahta hum / jaananaa chahta hum ki kya kuch chal rahaa us mayur / us kukkut kii deh main is brahm muhoort main
 It is only by reading this poem in full that the compassion-beauty can be interviewed that brings out many forms of youthfulness by refraining from different categories of narrowness
 arun camel kii kavita hameshaa puraa padhgaye kii maang karti he
 Reading them, one realizes that the best poems can occur in many forms — in many ways, in many ways in the architecture of poetry, in different types of clay, in the different presence of air
 is sangrah main ek kavita-shrunkhlaa he ‘pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke ailbum se
 'it has many paintings that bring out rare images of the collectivity of writers-artists
 jaise ki—jabalpur ke us college ke ek haul main / jahaan din main kakshaen chali hongi / maine dekha bhishma ji ne dari bicha di / or chadar duharaakar / peti ko takiya bana let gaye / bagal main pair mode gulam radbrabani taabaan
 It is a simple looking picture, but in its scope is a review of the culture of litfest
 jo peeche chhot gaya he, arun camel kii kavita uske liye badha hua haath he—abhi jab itani tej barish ho rahi he / tab main un logon ke bare main soch rahaa hum / jo apane duube gharon kii chappar par baithe hai / or pani chadhataa ja rahaa he
 Keeping an eye on the entire civilization, his poetry is deeply identified with contemporary
 apni sookshm antardrushti or gahari samvedan kshamta ke jariye ve vahaan tak jate hai jahaan dharti ke neeche jal he
 These are poems that you would like to quote excerpts from, but your reader will stop you or not, not only that, it is just a ventilation, where you can see the living of this house without the whole poem

 After this people caught the woman

 The resentment of the people kept increasing

 Angry people kept beating the woman and making videos in the dark of night, considering her to be a thief
 bheed khud hi mahila ko ghasitate hui thane le jane lagi
 Till then the police came to know about the case
 police maukey par pahunchi or bheed ke changul se mahila ko chhudaakar thane le gai
 Meanwhile, some people told the police that the woman was mentally unwell

 In this era of competition, in every case, the first condition of showing loyalty to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the most exclusive club of the country's self-styled devotees, strategists and planners, has become whether you eat meat or not
 nagpur ke chatur-sujanon ne shaayad bina munh khole hi yah aashwast kar liya ki maharashtra, chhattisgarh, haryana, rajasthan or jammu-kashmir main kuch dinon ke liye maance kii bikri par roak lag jaae
 For this, Paryushan festival of Jain society came to an end, which is ending on 17 September
 haalanki kuch log yah daleel denge ki sarkaar ko jarur hafte bhar ke liye aapaki thali ke vyanjan tay nahin karnaa chahie, magar shaakaahaar main bhala galat kya he
 All these states that ban the sale of meat are also bjp-ruled, so it was felt that the interference of politics in this intervention in food and drink is also huge
 isi se virodh kaa maamla bhi shuru ho gaya
 In fact, the Supreme Court had made a comment in March 2008 that if the Jain community is happy, then what is the harm in eating food without meat for a few days in a year
 ahmedabad ke kasaaikhane par bandish lagane ko jaij tehraane ke dauraan desh kii sarvocch adaalat ne kaha, ''hamaare jaise bahu-samskritiyon or tamaam tarah kii vividhtaon se bhare desh main samaaj ke ek khaas hisse kii bhaawanaaon kii kadra karne kii khatir choti-moti paabandiyon ko lekar ati samvedansheel nahin hona chahie
 "the Supreme Court further said in the meantime," It has been said that even the great emperor Akbar used to take vegetarianism a few days a week to appreciate the sentiments of a section of Indian society and his Hindu wife
 hamen bhi samaaj ke dusron tabakon kii bhaawanaaon kaa khyaal rakhana chahie or unka aadar karnaa chahie, khaskar jab maamla kisi alpsankhyak samaaj se judaa ho
 However, the question is that the population of the country is just 0
 4 pratishat kii hissedari vaale chote magar prabhaavshaalee jain samaaj ko itnaa rashtriya mahatv kyon mil gaya ki usase sarkaar kii jimmedaari banaam logon ke adhikaron par bahes chhid gai he
 The Jain community was given minority status in January 2014 by the UPA government of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 yah jaruri he ki is bahes main aage badaae ke pehle jain samaaj ke nazariye par gaur kar liya jaae
 Paryushan is 8 to 10 days every year
 isaki avadhi isse tay hoti he ki aap shwetambar jain hai yaa digambar
 During this Jain society meditates in the study and fasting is kept, for some days the consumption of fruits and vegetables is also left, so that no organism is disturbed and once a day, it only works by drinking boiled water
 goes
 parv ke aakhir main paryushan diwas par log yaa 'shravak' ek-duusare se pichley saal kii bhul-chook ke liye maafee maangate hai
 According to Jain scriptures, this festival is also an attempt to take the society towards Vishud Ahimsa
 maharashtra, gujarat or rajasthan jaise jain samaaj kii acchhee-khaasi aabaadi vaale rajyon main haal ke varshon main bhi paryushan parv ke dauraan kuch dinon ke liye apane yahaan kasaaikhane band karne kaa prachlan rahaa he, lekin maance kii bikri par pabandi kaa maamla to haal kaa he
 This smells of new politics
 pehle kasaaikhane kii bandi ke maamle par utana virodh nahin hota tha
 While delivering the decision to cancel the ban order in Mumbai, the Bombay High Court said, "the society in Mumbai has always had a progressive outlook
" ye kadam pratigaami hai
 We understand the matter of emotions, but what someone buys is a matter of personal dislike
 ''adaalat ne maharashtra sarkaar se yah bhi poocha ki ahimsa ke naam par usne samudri jeevon (machhliyon vagairah) or andon kii bikri par bhi pabandi kyon nahin lagaai or sirf maance ko pabandi ke liye kyon chunaa? nyayadhishon ne kaha, ''hamen bhumandalikaran ko dhyaan main rakhkar apana najariya badalanaa hoga
 "now it seems that on September 17, on the day of the conclusion of Paryushan festival, there will be a sale and sale of meat in Mumbai but not in the rest of Maharashtra
 rajasthan main 2008 main bijepi sarkaar ne nau dinon kaa pratibandh lagaaya tha, jise congress kii ashok gahalot sarkaar ne ghataakar teen dinon kaa kar diya tha
 This year too, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has ordered that the ban be for only three days
 isamen 17 sitambar shaamil hoga, jis din ganesh chaturthi bhi padati he
 Meat sales in Bangalore will also remain closed that day
 is bich haryana main har koi hairaan he ki maance kii bikri par pratibandh do dinon ke liye he yaa nau dinon ke liye yaa phir ek din ke liye bhi nahin he
 The office of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar neither confirms or refutes the dates of the ban
 kai adhikariyon ne to yahaan tak kaha ki rajya kii shahari sthaneey nikaay mantri kavita jain ne apane samudaay main vaahvahee batorne ke liye pratibandh kaa yah prastaav aage badhaayaa he
 It seems that the Jat-dominated Fatehabad Corporation Council issued a directive to close slaughterhouses on 10 September
 jain ke alaava sabhi iskaa khandan karte hai ki aisa koi aadesh jari kiya gaya he
 Meanwhile, in Chhattisgarh too, enthusiasm has cooled down and the ban has been reduced from four days to two days immediately
 jammu-kashmir main to vahaan ke dipti edwocket general parimoksha seth ne hi ek janhit yachika daayar kii ki 1930 ke dashak ke daur kaa ranvir dand samhita par amal kiya jaae, jab tatkaaleen kashmir ke maharaja hari singh ne vivaadaaspad pratibandh kaa aadesh diya tha
 BJP vice-president Vinay Sahasrabude believes that the media unnecessarily overstated the news of the ban
 ve bataate hai ki maharashtra main bandi kaa maamla kam se kam kuchhek dashak purana he
 He says that the media is "deliberately questioning intentions", whereas there is nothing like it
 ye maamle puraane hai, bijepi shaayad yah pehali dfa nahin kar rahi he
 He was asked whether the High Court has not criticized the Devendra Fadnavis government by canceling the Maharashtra government's order of imprisonment? Sahasrabude's reply was that courts sometimes pronounced "separate and unilateral" decisions in many cases
 bakaul unke, shaayad ab vakt aa gaya he ki sabhi samudaayon ke bich ''aahat bhaawanaaon kii raajaneet'' par bahes shuru honi chahie
 For example, it is common practice that the procession of Ganesh Chaturthi should not pass through a mosque
 lekin, sahasrabude kehete hai ki kisi or vannt main, jaisaa france kii patrika sharli edbrado ke maamle main, cartoon chhapane par bandish kii maang kaa nateeja bheeshan traasadee ke rup main saamne aayaa
 However, the ban on sale of meat in Maharashtra and Haryana, even if only for a few days, has made people realize that if you are not with the BJP, you are against it
 abhi kareeb dedh saal bhar pehle hi jis party ko itnaa baari janadesh mila tha, vah aapaki thali ke vyanjanon jaise chote-mote muddon par dhire-dhire uski bhaawanaaon se dur hoti ja rahi he
 This is not only a violation of that mandate, but it is also like pushing the country towards intolerance
 bijepi or pradhanmantri ko khaskar yah khyaal rakhana chahie ki hamaare daur ke apraasangik masale vikaas ke agenda ko apane saae main na dhak len

 aise maahaul main is kitaab kaa haath main aana vaaki kisi sukhad ehsaas se kam nahin he
 After reading it, it can be said that there is hope yet
 ste hungary ste phulish or karact da dot jaisi bestceller kitaaben likhane vaali rashmi bansal kii yah kitaab ummiden jagaane vaale 20 logon se rou-ba-rou karaati he
 These are the people who, unlike 125 crore other Indians, have decided to do something beyond their comfort zone
 ye aise 20 saamaajik udhyami hai jo ham aap main se hi hai lekin ye kisi kii vyathaa ko dekhakar us par dukh jataakar apana ferj nibhaane vaale nahin hai
 He proceeded on the same path and never looked back
 phir chaahe raah main kitni bhi pareshaniyaan kyon na aaen
 It has always been said that the revolution starts first by itself
 kuch aisa hi sapane sach hue main rashmi bansal ne bhi kaha he
 Napoleon talks about reading this book, "if you want something to be done excellently, then you do it yourself
" ’’ sabhi kahaniyaan yahi baat charitaarth karti lagati hai
 Rashmi has divided the book into three parts to make it interesting: the Meghdoot, the Changer and the Divine Capitalist
 meghdoot main shauchalay prashaadhan kranti ke janak sulabh international ke bindeshwar pathak se shuruyaat kii gai he
 a Brahmin who played an important role in liberating scavengers in India from their works
 bindeshwar kitaab main kehete hai, ‘‘ham mahasoos karte hai ki vaishvikaran kaa laabh nirdhan tak pahunche
 This work cannot be done with the mind, only with the heart
 ’’ isi dil kii baat ko sunakar hi unhone sulabh international ke jariye ek kranti ko janm diya
 Anand Kumar of Super-30 is one such name in the transformer who has changed the lives of thousands of poor children
 ve bharat kii andheri galiyon se naginon ko khojane or unhen taraashne ke kaam main lage hai
 His dream of studying in Cambridge could not be true but he is changing the lives of other students
 kitaab main ve kehete hai, ‘‘main bhagalpur, nalanda va gaya ke vidhyaarthiyon kii kahnaayen mobile phone par letaa
 "his passion for benefiting the students is clearly revealed by this fact
" isi khand main ek or naam arvind kejariwal kaa he
 Those who have raised their voice in favor of the common man these days and the lives of the corrupts have been stirred up with new revelations
 unka khwab ek aise sachche loktantr kaa he jahaan ek saadhaaran aadmi ko apane manamafik jeene kaa adhikaar hasil ho
 The credit of implementing the Right to Information in the country also goes to this former IRS officer
 ve yuva udhyamiyon ko salaah dete hai, ‘‘jis tarah ham apane-apane pariwaron kii bhalaai kii jimmedaari lete hai, usee tarah hamen desh kii bhalaai kii bhi jimmedaari leni chahie

 Is
 sach hue sapane rashmi bansal kii angreji kitaab aai haev a dream kaa hindi anuwaad he
 As usual Rashmi has used a very simple language
 anuwaad main bhi kaaphi had tak angreji kii isi panrapara ko nibhaane kii koshish kii gai he
 However, there are some words which get stuck somewhere and become a bit difficult for the general reader
 udhyami or lekhika rashmi kii pehali do kitabon ste hungary ste phulish or karact da dot kii paanch lakh se zyada pratiyaan bik chuki hai or uske das se zyada bhartiya bhashaaon main anuwaad bhi ho chuke hai
 Rashmi, an MBA from iim-ahmedabad, has the main voice to inspire the youth
 isliye unhen youth oriented subjects kii specialist bhi mana jaataa he
 If we talk about the purpose of writing this book, then clearly it seems to motivate the youth to do more than the statement by exposing us from the concept of us
 rashmi kahati hai, ‘‘ye parivartansheel log udhyamiyon kii tarah sochate hai
 These people are going to follow the concept of HUM from the limelight of me
 ’’ye aise log hai jo management ke siddhanton or aadhunik takanic ke istemaal se vishwa ko rahane ke liye ek behatar jagah banane kii koshishon main lage hai
 Equipped with the concept of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam and empowering the weak, this book can not only act as a source of inspiration for the youth, but also present the reality of the social revolutionaries of our time

 The name of another big actor is being discussed in his place
 khabaron kii maane to behtareen danceron main se ek rithik roshan ab ranvir kii jagah is kaarykram kaa hissaa ho sakate hai
 Please tell that Ranveer Singh was injured during a football match
 iske baad doctor ne unhen 1 maheene tak koi zyada mehnat vaala kaam naa karne kii salaah di he
 Ranveer injured during a football match, will not perform in IPL! There are also reports that Ranveer will continue shooting for the film 'gully Boy', but he will not be a part of the IPL Opening Day celebrations to avoid overstress
 unki jagah aayojak rithik roshan se is bare main baat kar rahe hai
 However, it has not been confirmed yet whether Hrithik has accepted this offer or not
 bataa den ki saal 2015 main kolkata main yojit IPL toornament ke opening de main rithik ne parform kiya tha
 In the IPL opening, this actor will get more money than Ranveer Singh! Varun Dhawan will also be a part of this program and for this he is reported to have been given about 6 crores
 bollywood kii glamras actress jacleen furnandis or pariniti chopra bhi is baar ke aayojan main chaar chand lagane ko taiyaar hai
 Before the elections, the Delhi Pradesh Congress has started sweating to get the youth excited
 party ke pradesh mukhyalay par yojit ek baithak main enesayuai ke kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ko kendriya mantri auskar furnandis ne jeet kaa gurumantra diya
 In this school, a call was made to unite the youth in the name of Rahul Gandhi
 dilli vishwavidhalay main is vakt chaaron siton par enesayuai kaa kabja he
 In such a situation where the challenge is to win all the seats again in the DUSU elections, then it is also important to prepare the atmosphere for the assembly elections
 is maukey par fernadis ne kaha ki party kaaryakartaaon or enesayuai ko dusu chunaavon se jeet kii shuruuaat kerani chahie
 Congress leaders know that winning these elections is not easy
 dusu chunaav ke nattejey desh main yuvaaon kii nabj tatolane kaa kaam karti he
 Seeing the way Narendra Modi's popularity has increased among the younger generation, the Congress does not want to leave its side 
 49 nikaayon main se 37 main congress ne jeeta chairman kaa chunaavtin jagah baraabar rahe vot, lottery se hua faislamaharashtra main sarkaar banane ke baad beabaru hokar satta ganvaane vaali bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke liye rajasthan main nikaay chunaav ke parinaam niraashajanak rahe
 Congress won the victory in the civic elections
 pradesh kii sattadhari party kul 49 main se 37 nikaayon main apanechairmanaya meyar banane main safal rahi
 Both parties got equal votes in the three bodies, after which the decision had to be made by lottery
 lottery se jin teen siton kaa faisla hua, unamem se do siton nasirabad or udaipur main congress kaa board bana
 At the same time, one seat went to Chhabra bjp's court
 upmukhyamantri sachin payalat ke liye bhi badi raahat kii khabar ai
 In Tonk, a Congress board was formed, where only 24 councilors of Congress won while 36 councilors voted for Congress

 Elections were held in three places of the Municipal Corporation and BJP got a good lead in all three, but the Congress was successful in making its Mayor by breaking independents and councilors in Bharatpur

 bhaajapaane chunaav ke dauraan dhara 370 or ayodhya main ram mandir ke mudde par supreme court ke faisle ko bhi khub prachaarit kiya, lekin yah bhi kaam nahin aayaa
 Bollywood is the biggest example of nepotism like Indian politics
 jahaan kapur, chopra, roshan or khan kaa kabja he, or film industry main outsidar ke liye jagah bananaa koi aasaan kaam nahin he
 But if there is a star kid then there are plenty of opportunities
 flop zyada myne nahin rakhti or kariyar hichkole khate hue chalata hi rahata he
 Last week, Anil Kapoor's brother Sahebzade and Sonam Kapoor's brother Harshvardhan Kapoor knocked at the box office
 film aundhe munh box offis par giri
 The pair of Sayami Kher, who belonged to Kapoor Sun and the film family, had no current and the pair failed miserably to bring viewers to theaters
 harshavardhan kapurko is baat se saavdhaan ho janaa chahie kyonki yah sanket unke liye achche nahin hai
 Being a star father, the viewers find the same skill in the son and the same mastery
 agar betaa baap se kahin bhi unniis niklaa to uskaa hashr bura hota he
 As happened to Jitendra's son Tusshar Kapoor
 vah jumping jaik pita ke aasapaas kahin bhi nahin the or sirf apni bahan kii filmon ke sahare hi kariyar chalaa rahe he
 But the most dangerous for Star Kids is the active father and that too if he is in the main role
 jaisaa abhishek bachchan ke maamle main hai
 When Abhishek started his career with Refugee in 2000, his father Amitabh Bachchan was doing films like 'muhabbatein' and 'aankhen'
 unka film industry main puraa jalawaa tha or unhen lekar filmein likhi ja rahi thim
 His style dominated everyone's hearts and minds
 aise main abhishek kii entry hui or vah lakh koshishon ke baavjood darshakon kaa dil us tarah jeetne main kaamyaab nahin ho sake, jis tarah kaa jalawaa unke pita ne bikheraa tha
 He was unsuccessful despite millions of attempts and is running a kabaddi league with films (mostly multistarrer) nowadays
 harshavardhan kapur ko is baat ko bahut saavdhaanee se lenaa hoga kyonki unke pita anil kapur filmon main sakriy hai
 These days he is showing his Jhakaas style with 24 on TV
 khaas yah ki 24 kaa yah sijan-2 he
 That means success is still kissing his steps and that too on both big and small screen
 vah hollywood main 'mishan imposible' jaisi film kar chuke hai or 'slamdog milinyar' to sabko yaad hi he
 His race franchises are quite popular in the audience
 anil kapur 59 saal ke hai or apane luk or bindaasapan kii vajah se unki umr kaa koi andaja hi nahin laga saktaa he
 Then the kind of energy he brings is amazing
 unki kamedi film 'vailcom back' bhi hit rahi he
 Harshvardhan will not let the glimpse of the father dominate himself anywhere
 unhen na to anil kapur jaise naachne kii jarurat he, na hi hansane kii or na hi chalane kii or na hi jhakaas bolne kii
 'mirziya' can be an accident
 lekin harshavardhan ko kahin bhi aisi koi koshish nahin kerani chahie jisase camperijan shuru ho jaae
 Forgetting to be his star kid, he has to rely on the story of the film and his talent because being a superstar sun, he can get films, but will get success on his own

 bhaajapa ne sonia gandhi ke hamale par kaha ki use congress se jimmedaari kaa pramaan-patr lene kii aavashyaktaa nahin he, use usase javabdehi ke aacharan kii apeksha he
 BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the government only talks about discussion within Parliament but not about accountability
 vahiin, bhaajapa kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne saaf kaha ki sarkaar party kii teen sharton ko sweekaar kar legi tab vah sansad main apane kadam peeche khinch legi
 The first condition is that PM will resign
 iske alaava sabhi 142 aavanton radd kiye jaaen or teesri shart in sabhi maamalon main jaanch kaa aadesh diya jaae
 The comments udhar, kaig report par bijepi ne ab sansad kii ladaai ko sadak par le jane kaa faisla kar liya he
 The party has decided in a meeting of top leaders that the party will open a road front against the government and make people aware against the scams of the government
 gauratlab he ki kol block aavanton ke mudde par bhartiya janata party ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh par sidhaa hamalaa bolaa he or piem ke istife kii maang par adi hui he
 At the same time, BJP leader Sushma Swaraj clearly said that if the government accepts the three conditions of the party, then it will step back in Parliament
 pehali shart he ki piem apana istipha denge
 Apart from this, all 142 allocations should be canceled and the third condition should be ordered inquiry in all these cases
 tippaniyan On the other hand, on the CAG report, the BJP has now decided to take the Parliament battle on the road
 party ne aalaa netaaon kii baithak main faisla kiya he ki party sarkaar ke khilaaf sadakon par morcha kholegi or logon ko sarkaar ke ghotaalon ke khilaaf jaagruk karegi
 Significantly, on the issue of coal block allocation, the Bharatiya Janata Party has directly attacked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and is adamant on the demand for pm's resignation

 It may be a coincidence that discord within the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has come to the surface when the BJP broke its three-and-a-half-year-old alliance with Mehbooba Mufti's government in Jammu and Kashmir
 haalanki iskaa andeshaa to pehle se hi tha ki pidipi ke bheetar sab kuch thik nahin he
 Now the six party mlas have openly waved the rebellion against Mehbooba Mufti
 lekin zyaadaatar logon kii ummiido ke ulat, pidipi main upje is asantosh ke peeche bhaajapa kaa haath nahin lag rahaa
 Actually, this is the result of Mehbooba's efforts to continuously promote her family's loyalists in the government as well as the party
 andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki gambhir matbhed pehle bhi saamne aae the, jab mahabuuba ne apane chote bhai or peshey se cinemetographer tasadduk mufti ko apni cabinet main shaamil karte hue paryaton mantri bana diya tha
 His move created a fury among some mlas who aspired for the ministerial berth
 purv mantri or kaddavar shiya netaa imran raja ansaari ne us vakt aitraaj kiya tha or tasadduk ke shapath grahan samaaroh main shaamil hone se manaa kar diya tha
 Today they are leading the rebels
 unka kahana he ki sari samasya darasal mufti mohammad said kii janvari 2016 main bevakt maut ke baad shuru hui thi
 According to Ansari, Mehbooba has cut her relatives and family loyalists from their father's thinking of sitting everywhere and taking them along
 mahabuuba ke mamaa sartaaj madani or pirjada mansoor hossain jaise chunaav haar gaye vyaktiyon ko kramshah pidipi kaa adhyaksh or mahasachiv niyukt kiya gaya
 This thing did not end with Mehbooba
 madani or hossain, donon ne bhi apane-apane rishtedaaron ko aage badhanaa shuru kar diya
 In fact, Madani's son Syed Arut was elected as the executive officer of the State Khadi Village Industries Board by manipulation, after which a big political mess started in the state
 ansaari kehete hai, ''sartaaj (madani) hi sab kuch chalaate hai
 If your relationship with them is not sweet, then there will be difficulties for you all around
 ''dakshin kashmir main mufti said ke kareebi sahyogi rahe pirjada mohammad hossain ne 2017 main jammu-kashmir vakf board se khud ko beizzat karke baahar kiye jane ke peeche 'rajnatik chatukaaron kii chaukadi' ko doshi tehraaya tha
 He says, "I was punished for speaking the truth
" aaj saare log vahi baaten kar rahe hai
 It was only after the death of Mufti Saeed that i suspected a schism
 '' jadibal ke vidhayak aabid ansaari ne sabase pehle baghawat kii aawaaj buland kii
 He says that a group of unhappy legislators had also met Mehbooba at his home in Srinagar before the government collapsed last month
 aabid kehete hai ki mahabuuba ne saaf kar diya tha, ve apane parivaar ke sadasyon ke khilaaf kisi bhi shikaayat ko bardaasht nahin karengi
 Senior BJP leaders from Kashmir claim that 21 of the pdp's 28 mlas were willing to break the party and form a government with the BJP
 ye chah baagi vidhayak bhi unamem shaamil the
 Former Deputy Chief Minister Kavinder Gupta said openly that "there are still hopes of a new alliance as the Assembly has not been dissolved yet
" ''unhone to yahaan tak daawa kiya ki ''neshnal conference or congress ke kuch vidhayak bhi is sambhavit nae gathan main shaamil ho sakate hai
 Sources said that the BJP has engaged former ministers Haseeb Drabu and Abdul Haq Khan to bring PDP mlas into their ranks
 jaahir he, party main send se mahabuuba baukhalaai hui hai or unhone dilli main bhaajapa ko chetate hue kaha, ''agar dilli se hamaari party ko todgaye kii chaal chali jaati he or party todakar sajaad lone yaa kisi anya ko mukhyamantri bana diya jaataa he to kashmiriyon kaa bhartiya loktantr se vishwaas uth jayega
 "ansari laughs at his point and asks," What does Delhi have to do with us on this issue? They are shedding tears
 kashmir kii avam ne hamen chunaa he, na ki dilli ne
 What is Delhi's deal with our rebellion? ”after the PDP rebellion, the politics of Jammu and Kashmir is seen revolving around bjp's ally Sajjad Gani Lone, President of the People's Conference (PC)
 27 june ko srinagar pahunche bhaajapa mahasachiv ram madhav ne bhaajapa netaaon ke saath-saath lone se bhi mulaakaat kii
 This further fueled these speculations
 dilachasp baat he ki madhav rajya main ek nae gathbandhan kii sambhaavna kii afvaahon par lagaam lagane kii koshish karte bhi najar aae
 In a tweet on 7 July, he stressed that the BJP is in favor of 'continuation of Governor's rule for the restoration of peace in the state'
 vaise do din baad madhav ne pidipi main vidroh kii baat ko sweekaar bhi kiyah ''pidipi main baghawat ke sur ubhar rahe hai par bhaajapa kii pidipi ke baagi netaaon ke saath milakar gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane kii koi baatcheet nahin chal rahi he
 Meanwhile, according to sources, Mehbooba was scheduled to meet on July 8 with 21 PDP mlas, but only 12 mlas arrived
 baagi vidhayak imran or aabid ansaari isse dur rahe, jabaki ek anya vidhayak javed beg ne kaha ki ve aane vaale dinon main mahabuuba se milenge
 Will he support Mehbooba in such a difficult time, he could not avoid saying anything on this question
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki july 2016 main hijbul mujahidin ke ladaake burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad se ghati main mukhyadhara ke siyaasi dalon-mukhya rup se pidipi, neshnal conference, congress—ke liye jagah lagaataar ghati hi he
 Therefore, there can be a lot of opportunity for a new political axis to emerge around Sajjad Lone
 phir bhi, agast maheene tak chunki amarnath yatra chalegi, isliye tab tak rajya main koi badi rajnatik halchal kii sambhaavna kam hi dikhti he
 Even after that a lot will depend on that now Governor N

 yah kahana he ki kendriya mantri dow
 Of Jitendra Singh
 dhara 371 ke tahat hi purvottar ke rajyon ko vishesh rajyon kaa darja mila he
 Jitendra Singh said in a tweet on Friday morning that there is no need to fear the North East, Section 371 will remain the same
 isse pehle grih mantri amit shah ne bhi kaha tha ki 370 or 371 ke bich main antar he
 The opposition is spreading confusion over this
 bataa den ki desh ke 11 rajyon main dhara 371 lagu he jo centre sarkaar ko vishesh takat detii he
 Due to this section, the central government can work related to development, security, safety etc
 in that state
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 371 (ji) main kaha gaya he ki sansad mizos kii dharmik or saamaajik prathaon, bhoomi swaamitv hastantaran ke maamalon par vidhansabha kii sahmati ke bina nirnay nahin le sakati he
 Article 371 (a) of the constitution states that Parliament cannot change the traditional practices, governing, civil and criminal justice rules of the Naga community regarding the ownership of land
 centre sarkaar is par tabhi faisla le sakati he jab rajya kii vidhansabha koi sankalp yaa kanoon na lekar aae
 This law was made when the Government of India and the Naga people reached an agreement on 16 points in 1960
 centre sarkaar ne ek aitihaasik kadam main, jammu-kashmir ko vishesh darja dene vaale dhara 370 ko hataa diya or rajya ko do centre shasit pradeshon main vibhajit kar diya

 Former Mumbai Police Commissioner and BJP MP Satyapal Singh has made a big disclosure about the Islamic campaigner Zakir Naik, who came to the discussion after last week's terror attack in Dhaka
 satyapal singh ne daawa kiya he ki unhone jakir nike kii sandigdh gatividhiyon ko lekar 2008 main centre sarkaar ko report bheji thi lekin us par koi karrwai nahin hui
 Accusing him of tricking people, he said that he was a commissioner when he was commissioner
 jakir ko lekar sarkaar kobhi avgat karaayaa tha lekin sarkaar ne dhyaan nahin diya jiske chalate aaj ye din dekhnaa pad rahaa he
 Zakir Naik Dharma makes changes and trick people, he is also funded from abroad
 upi sarkaar ko bhi gheraabagapat se bhaajapa saansad satyapal singh ne shanivaar ko meerut main patrkaar vaarta karte hue kanoon vyavastha ko lekar upi sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa kiya vahiin vivaadon main aaye dow
 Zakir Naik demanded a funding inquiry
 'nike kii sabhaaon main gaya hum'dow
 Regarding Zakir, Satyapal Singh said that he has known him for a decade
 wo khud bhi unki sabhaaon main gaye hai or vahaan kii haalat dekh chuke hai
 He said that his foundation should be canceled in view of the religious conversion taking place there through foreign funding
 'sarkaar ne gambhirtha se nahin liya'purv mumbai police kamishnar or bagpat se saansad satyapal singh se jab jakir nike par sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha ki 2008 ke dauraan jab ve mumbai police kamishnar the tab unhone uski jaanch kar ek report rajya sarkaar or tatkaaleen centre sarkaar ko bheji thi
 And had asked for action on it but the Government of India did not get serious at that time
 agar gambhir hui hoti to aaj ye din naa dekhnaa padataa
 Today 'bharat Bandh' is closed by the organized organizations against the Scheduled castes-scheduled Tribes (SC / ST) Amendment Act
 sadakon par utarkar savarna SC / ST act ko khatm karne kii maang kar rahe hai, lekin koi bhi siyaasi party unke samarthan main khulkar nahin aa rahi he
 Whereas the Savarna community in the country has a large political power and knows the skill from making power to spoiling
 SC / ST act ke khilaaf savarna samaaj, karani sena, or saamaanya, pichhadaa evam alpsankhyak varg adhikari karmchaaree sanstha (sapaks) sahit savarnon samudaay ke 35 sanghathan 'bharat band' kaa elaan kar sadak par utre hue hai
 During this time, cases of arson and sabotage are coming up in many places
 desh main savarna samudaay kii aabaadi kareeb 15 fisadi he
 These are believed to be the original vote banks
 isiilie bijepi ko savarnon kii party kaha jaataa he
 The BJP, known as the brahmin-rajput-kayastha, Bhumihar and Vaishya's party, is gradually expanding its reach among every section of the society
 2014 ke chunaav ke dauraan se hi bijepi pichhadi-atipichdi jatiyon ke alaava dalit or adivaasiyon ke bich apane janaadhar ko behatar karne kii koshish main lagi he
 This was also seen in the Lok Sabha and Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, in which people voted for the BJP by breaking the caste bond in the name of Modi
 desh main 543 loksabhaa siten hai
 Of these, 131 seats are reserved for the SC-ST community, of which 84 seats are for the scheduled castes and 47 seats for the tribes
 maujuuda vakt main bijepi ke paas is tabake ke 67 saansad hai
 This is why BJP is not willing to take any risky political steps
 jabaki vipaksh lagaataar bijepi par dalit virdohi hone kaa aarope lagaataa aa rahaa he
 As a result, the Supreme Court's decision has forced the BJP to reverse
 modi sarkaar kaa yahi faisla ab use gale kii fans ban gaya he
 The result of this is that the original votebank of the BJP is showing its eye to the BJP, which holds the reputation of the upper caste party
 iskaa nateeja he ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne party netaaon or mukhyamantriyon ko savarna samudaay kii naaraazgi ko dur karne or unhe samajhane kii jimmedaari saunpi he
 The upper caste community is seen against other parties including BJP and Congress
 haalanki savarnon kii naaraazgi kaa sabase zyada nuksaan bijepi ko hota dikh rahaa he
 In order of protest from these upper caste organizations, an appeal is being made to suppress NOTA in the next election
 aise main savarnon samudaay naaraaz hokar baith jaataa he, to phir gorakhpur or phulpur jaise nateezon se bijepi ko rubaru hona pad saktaa he

 vishvavidhyalay ke bayaan ke mutabik is tarah saura mandal ke jivan ke ansh milky ve akaash ganga main lagaataar fail rahe hai

 bharat ne lambey samay tak kootnithik dhiraj kaa paalan karte hue usee sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad se azhar ko global aatanki kii suchi main dalwaaya he jahaan se use 2009, 2016, 2017 or march 2019 main pehle safalataa nahin mili
 This success in the fifth time will become an example of diplomatic endurance
 1 may ko jab 9 baje tak china kii taraf se koi aapatti nahin ai tab elaan ho gaya ki sanyukt raashtra kii al kaayda cameti masood azhar ko al-kaayda se sambandh rakhane ke aarope main global aatanki kii suchi main daalati he
 India had tried to put Masood Azhar in the terrorist list after the Pulwama attack, but China did not agree with India's arguments
 is baar china sahamat nahin hota to is par sanyukt raashtra main khulaa matdaan hota, tab china ke liye mushkil ho jaati
 On 27 February, the United States, Britain and France jointly proposed against Masood Azhar
 usamen yah aadhaar tha ki jaish e mohammad ne ghatana kii zimmedaari lee he
 On March 13, China objected
 is baar 23 april ko phir se is prastaav ko kholaa gaya
 The deadline for filing objections was kept until 1 May
 masood azhar ko aatanki suchi main isliye rakhaa gaya he kyonki cameti ne paaya he ki masood azhar ne jaish-e mohammad ko saport kiya he
 The jaish-e-mohammed, which was banned in 2001 by the same 1267 committee of the United Nations
 jaish e mohammad par aarope tha ki al kaayda se uske vittiya or anya sambandh aatanki sanghathan al-qaayada se rahe hai

 India surrounded Masood Azhar on this basis
 lekin is baar ke prastaav se pulavama hamale ko hataa diya gaya
 Pakistan and China wanted that the reference to Pulwama be removed
 isliye 1267 ke prastaav main pulavama or 2008 ke mumbai hamale kaa zikr nahin he
 The attack on Parliament is not mentioned
 IC 814 kii ghatana kaa zikr he
 India has been demanding that he be tried and punished in the Mumbai attack case
 acha hota ki masood azhar bharat main hui aatanki gatividhiyon ke kaaran pratibandhit hota
 With this, India would have also recognized the terrorist activities of Pakistan in its geographical area
 masood azhar hamaara dushman he kyonki vah bharat kii zamin par hue aatanki hamalon kaa apradhi he
 However, he has been punished for other reasons
 yah khushi kii baat he
 Pakistan can say that Pulwama is not mentioned
 use raajnneetik taur par badnaam karne ke liye iskaa zikr daalaa gaya lekin masood azhar he to usee kaa naagarik
 Is it a shame to be banned for having links with al-qaeda! India and the world will now be looking at when Masood Azhar is arrested
 vah uske kilaaf kya karrwai karata he
 Pakistan has said that it will implement the ban
 2001 main jaish-e-mohammad par pratibandh laga tha
 Even after this, this institution is mentioned in many incidents
 iske baad bhi vahi america or vahi china pakistan ke saath sambandh banaae hue hai
 China has also issued a statement on this incident
 china hameshaa maanata rahaa he ki is tarah kaa kaam vistrut jaankaree, thos saboot, peshewar aadhaar or sarvasammati se hona chahie na ki purvaagrah ke aadhaar par
 Relevant countries have changed their proposal after positive interaction with the parties concerned
 china ko etraz nahin he
 That is, the things that China had objected to have been accepted
 china ne apane bayaan main yah bhi joda he ki pakistan ne aatankwaad se ladane main kaaphi yogadan kaa he
 The international community should give credit to Pakistan for this
 aatank se ladane main pakistan ko sahyog kare
 China a few days ago described Pakistan as its all-weather partner
 pakistan bhi apana spes mishan kaamyaab bananaa chahta tha
 He wants to send a manned vehicle in which China is helping him

 ) rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) bhale hi apane aapako gaiyr raajnneetik sanghathan kahata ho or dharmik, saamaajik or saanskrithik kshetra main kaam karne kaa daawa karata ho
 But he is a major force in the current political scenario of India
 aazaadee ke baad ye pehali baar he jab desh ke teenon sarvocch sanvaidhanik padon par aresas ke swayamsevak kabiz hai
 Not only this, in more than half the states of the country, the chief ministers associated with the RSS are the chief ministers
 30 janvari, 1948 ko mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke baad rashtriya swayamsevak sangh par pratibandh laga diya gaya tha
 The ban on the Sangh was lifted after 18 months on July 11, 1949, when the then Union Chief Madhavrao Sadashiv Golwalkar accepted the condition of the then Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel that the Sangh would prepare its written constitution in which democratic elections And he will remain completely away from political activities
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh pratyaksh taur par raajnneetimen hissaa nahin letaa he or na hi chunaav ladata he
 But he has a lot of interference and control in politics from behind the scenes
 sangh maujuuda daur kii raajnneeti main dhuree bana hua he
 The country's President Ramnath Kovind, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are volunteers from the Sangh's courtyard
 desh ke bees rajyon main bijepi or uske sahyogi dalon kii sarkarein hai
 The chief ministers of most of these states have been directly associated with the union
 upi ke yogi adityanath, uttarakhand ke trivendra singh ravat, haryana ke manohar lala khatter, maharashtra ke devendra fadanvis, jharkhand ke raghuvar das jaise naam inamen shaamil hai
 At the same time, there is a long list of volunteer ministers in the Modi government of the Center
 aresas bijepi sarkaron ke kaamkaaj par paryaapt najar rakhata he
 The Sangh also organizes coordination meetings for this
 is baithak ke jariye sangh padaadhikari bijepi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kii samiksha karte hai
 The union also determines the condition and direction of the government if necessary
 sangh sarkaar par hi nahin balki bijepiper bhi khaasaa niyantran rakhata he
 The RSS appoints one of its officials as an organization minister in the party to act as a coordinator between the BJP and the Sangh
 rashtriya sanghathan se lekar jila str tak par bijepi main sanghathan mantri kii ahm bhoomika hoti he
 The organization minister in BJP attends parliamentary board meetings and is invited to all major meetings of the RSS
 isliye use har jwalanth mudde par us rajnatik sanghathan or uske vaicharik sanchaalak kii soch maaloom hoti he
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh appoints at least one pracharak as organization minister for each of its more than three dozen partner organizations
 pradhanmantri narendra modi khud sanghathan mantri ke rup main sangh se bijepi main aae the
 During the atal-advani era, the Sangh had appointed Govindacharya as the organization minister for the BJP
 isi tarah maujuuda samay main raamalaal sanghathan mantri ke taur par kaam kar rahe hai
 Haryana Governor Kaptan Singh Solanki has been bjp's organization minister in MP
 aaj rashtriya str par bijepi ke sabase kaddavar netaaon main shumaar party mahasachiv ram madhav bhi kuch saal pehle tak aresas ke akhil bhartiya sah sampark pramukh the
 The Sangh also undertakes the work of preparing political ground for the BJP
 yahi vajah he ki jin rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hote hai vahaan swayamsevak party ummidavaar ke liye ghar-ghar jaakar vot maangane kaa kaam karte hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Sangh played an important role in making Narendra Modi the Prime Minister with full force
 kii raajnneeti main dakhal kii shuruyaat jansangh se hoti he
 Dr
 shyama prasad mukherjee ne 1951 main sangh ke kaaryakartaaon ko lekar jansangh kii sthapana kii
 In the general elections held in 1952, the Jana Sangh participated as a political party, it did not get much success in it
 lekin raajnneeti ke kshetra main uski dastak mahatvapurn rahi
 Sangh campaigners Nanaji Deshmukh, Balraj Madhok, Bhai Mahaveer, Sundarsingh Bhandari, Jagannathrao Joshi, LK Advani, Kushabhau Thakre, Rambhau Godbole, Gopalrao Thakur and Atal Bihari Vajpayee played a key role in strengthening the Jana Sangh
 1975 main indira gandhi ne desh main apatkaal lagaaya tha
 The Sangh strongly opposed it
 lokanayak jaiprakash narayan ke andolan main sangh kii pramukh bhagidaari rahi
 When the Janata Party was formed in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with it
 iske baad desh kii satta main janata party kii sarkaar bani, to sangh se aae hue netaa mantri bane
 It was the first time in the Janata Party government that the people of the Union became ministers

 When Gaurav Sethi and Akhili Matta were present at a party
 akhili ko gaurav ke kapadon kii almaari se ek note mila
 Which wrote '25 August 2012: CS Gaurav Sethi' and '11 December 2015: Harley Davidson Iron 883
 'us samay gaurav or akhili garlfriend-bwoyfriend the
 But after reading that note, Akhili realized that Harley Davidsonkitney is important in Gaurav's life
 gaurav us vakt wo bike kharid saktaa to shaayad daaen-baayen bhi nahin dekhtaa lekin harley kii keemat chukaane ke liye uske paas paise nahin the
 This is where the unique story of Akhil Caprem and Dedication started
 unhone tay kar liya ki chaahe ja ho jaae wo gaurav ke is sapane ko sach karke rahengi or unhone paise jamaa karne shuru kar die
 While depositing money, he also compromised many times with many things that he needed
 unka sirf ek hi lakshya tha ki jis taarikh ko gaurav ne apane note main likhaa he wo us taarikh tak kisi bhi haal main gaurav ko wo bike gift kar den
 When that day finally came, he made a film for that whole day
 gaurav kii ankhon par pattee baandhakar unhen harley davidson ke showrooms laayaa gaya
 It is difficult to describe in words what Gaurav was feeling at that time
 kuch maheenon baad gaurav or akhili apni harley davidson se rajasthan ghoomane gaye
 While Bollywood is in a rage due to the rise of Karni Sena on the sets of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavati in Jaipur, Karni Sena itself has no regrets for doing so
 uskaa kahana he ki galati bhansaali kii hi he jo film ke jariye itihaas se chhedchhad kar rahe hai
 Lokendra Singh Kalvi, the founder of Rajput Karni Sena said that the history of Rajputs under our nose is being tampered with the history of our ancestors

 As the winter season approaches, where the entire body starts to dry, there is also the problem of lips breaking
 ye ek behad aam pareshaani he
 You must also know that the skin of our lips is much thinner and more sensitive than any other part of the body
 thandi hawaaon or mausam ke badalane se honton kii nami kahin kho si jaati he or ve fatne lag jate hai
 In such a situation, it becomes very important that we take good care of our lips so that they always remain soft, soft and beautiful
 isse pehle kii ham aapako ye bataaen ki honton kii dekhbhaal kaise karen ye jaananaa bahut jaruri he ki hont fatne ke kya-kya kaaran ho sakate hai
 Along with changing seasons, some of our habits are also responsible for this problem
 jo log apane hont chabate hai, baar-baar honton par jeebh pherate hai yaa kam pani pite hai unhen bhi is samasya se do-chaar hona padataa he
 At the same time, the use of cheap and inferior chemical products also causes lips to crack
 hont fatne kaa ek doosraa kaaran hormones kaa asantulit hona bhi ho saktaa he
 If your lips are also cracked, then follow these remedies: 1
 agar aapke hont fat rahe hai to iskaa sidhaa sa matlab he ki aapke sharir main nami kii kami he
 Whatever you apply externally, but as long as there is no moisture inside, there will be no benefit
 2
 There should be no shortage of water in the body
 sardiyon main bhi koshish karen ki rojaanaa 8 se 10 gilaas pani pien
 If the lips are dry, do not make the mistake of turning the tongue on them
 3
 Any product you use should be of high quality
 aap chahen to baadaam ke tel yaa phir jojoba oil kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 4
 kai baar honton kaa fatna poshak tatwon kii kami kii vajah se bhi hota he
 In this case, take full care of your diet so that the body does not lack any elements
 5
 Massage the lips lightly with a little bit of native ghee in the finger
 isse rakt sanchaar badhegaa or honton ke fatne kii samasya main raahat milegi
