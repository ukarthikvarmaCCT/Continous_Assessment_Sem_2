 ) peedita ko muaavja dene ke liye senger ke paas nahin hai paisewakil ne kaha- aarthik sthiti behad kharaab, do betiyaan bhiunnav rape cese main balaatkaar ke doshi kuldeep singh senger ko kitni sajaa honi chahie, is par donon taraf ke vakeelon kii taraf se court main jirah chal rahi thi
 After hearing the side of CBI and the victim's lawyer, when the judge asked Sanger's lawyer to present his case in this case, the lawyer said that Kuldeep Singh Sengar did not have the money to pay the victim as compensation
 vakil ne kaha ki senger kii aarthik sthiti behad kharaab he
 Apart from this, he has two daughters, whose responsibility for marriage is also on Sanger
 lihaaja peedita ko muaavja diya jaae, to wo senger kii taraf se na diya jaae
 The lawyer argued that the financial condition of Kuldeep Sengar, who became MLA 4 times, is not good
 is tark ko sunne ke baad jaj dharmesh sharma ne kaha ki vaise to koi bhi muaavja peedita ko pahunche aghat kii purti nahin kar saktaa, lekin aap kah rahe hai ki doshi kuldeep singh senger kii aarthik sthiti bahut acchhee nahin, wo chunaav ladate hai, to kya bina paison ke ladate hai
 The Do they have no money? The UP government has paid 25 lakh compensation
 The argument of the Supreme Court in this case was that the Uttar Pradesh government has already given 25 lakh rupees to the victim
 isliye muaavje ke taur par agar kuch or peedita ko court kii taraf se rakam dene kaa aadesh diya jaataa he, to vah rakam senger se naa vasuuli jaae
 However, the victim's lawyer Dharmendra Mishra objected to Sanger's lawyer's plea for compensation
 peedita ke vakil ne kaha ki muaavja dete vakt is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie ki is rape ke baad uske pita kii maut ho chuki he
 She has lost two more family members after the father in a road accident
 iske alaava usko apni jaan bachaane ke liye unnav ko bhi chhodana padaa he or philhal wo dilli main kiraye ke makaan main rah rahi he
 He does not have his own house, so the compensation of 25 lakhs received from the Supreme Court should be kept separate from the present compensation
 peedita ke vakil dharmendra mishra ke aitraaj par jaj dharmesh sharma ne kaha ki aapane kaha ki wo log waapas gaanv nahin ja sakate, aap peedita se ek baar dobaaraa baat kiijie
 The next hearing will be held on December 20, the CBI said that how much compensation should be given to the victim, it should be decided keeping in mind the economic condition of Kuldeep Sengar
 sibiai ne kaha abhi tak supreme court ke aadesh par 25 lakh rupee bataur muaavja uttar pradesh sarkaar de chuki he
 In this case the victim should also be compensated
 peedita ko muaavja guidelins ke mutabik milanaa chahie
 Now the court has instructed Sanger to submit affidavits and documents related to income and assets during the election, i
e
 Kuldeep Singh Sengar will have to give full details of his income and assets

 The heart of Buddha's city was shattered
 bodhgaya hamaare desh kii shaan he
 It has been a witness to centuries of history, so its importance can be understood religiously by the fact that UNESCO has declared it as a World Heritage Site
 gautam buddha ko jahaan gyaan mila, jahaan unhen bhagwaan kaa darja mila, vahaan apane napak iraade lekar pahunch gaye aatanki
 Where first the great mantra of Gunja 'buddha Sharanam Gachhami', where Prince Siddharth did penance, where Siddhartha got knowledge, where Gautama Buddha called Siddhartha after attaining knowledge, he is the center of Gautama Buddha's penance Mahabodhi Temple
 ravivaar ko bodhgaya ke mahabodhi mandir main khaas parikrama hoti he

 Eight consecutive blasts
 aatanki dhamaakon se mandir par to koi khaas asar nahin padaa, lekin yahaan kaa pavitra pipal kaa ped kshatigrast ho gaya
 Bodhgaya is called the city of Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism
 yahi wo jagah he jahaan buddha ko gyaan mila or ve siddharth se gautam buddha kahalaane lage
 This place of knowledge of Gautama Buddha is centuries old
 bodhgaya baudhon kaa sabase bada tirthasthal, he to vahiin gautam buddha kaa mahabodhi mandir baudhon ke liye sabase badi aasthaa kaa centre
 Not only Buddhists, people of all religions and sects of the world come here for spiritual peace
 aasthaa ke yah centre duniya bhar main mashhoor he
 This is the reason why in the year 2002, UNESCO declared Bodh Gaya as a World Heritage Site
 mahabodhi mandir main gautam buddha kii padmasana mudra main jo murti he, vahi buddha kii sabase pratishthit pratimaa he
 In the temples of Nalanda and Vikramashila, the idol has been made by imitating the same idol
 bharat sabhi dharmon kaa sammaan karne vaala desh he
 The faith centers of all religions are here
 hamaare desh main sabhi dharmon or dharmavalambiyon kii aasthaa kaa sammaan karne kii sanathan parampara rahi he
 In such a situation, everyone is hurt by the attack on the city of Gautama Buddha, the biggest pilgrimage of Buddhists and teaching true non-violence to the world

 When Chopra Camp was launched by Ranveer Singh in the band Baja Barat, no one thought that big film makers would ever sign him
 vajah thi ek to unki gali ke ladke vaali acting or doosraa- ranbir kapur kaa bhi usee dauraan industry main aana
 It was being said that Ranbir Kapoor will go ahead in the race because he is associated with the industry and Kapoor's name is behind his name
 lekin box offis ke aankadon main ranvir singh zyada damdaar khilaadi sabit hue
 Not only this, it is believed that he can also replace Shah Rukh and Salman Khan in the coming times
 hema malini kii beti ko ranvir ne diya tha dhokhaditya ke offis main postarbataya jaataa he ki yashraj films ke maalik aditya chopra ke offis main teen hi poster lage hai - salmaan khan, shahrukh khan or ranvir singh
 Now you would call it the value of a star only after Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan
 isaki vajah aditya chopra ne ek dilachasp jawaab se bataai ki jab ranvir unke binar ko acchhee kamai karavaate hai to offis main unka poster laganaa hi chahie
 PHOTOS: On the birthday, Ranveer bought the new car, fitted with Deepika in the frame of Parsha Rukh, Deepika, Ranveeraditya Chopra once made films with Shahrukh Khan
 unke saath unhone teen hit filmein banaain- dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge, mohabbatein or rab ne bana di jodi
 But in the modern version of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, that is, he took Ranvir Singh
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki unke dimag main ranvir kahin na kahin shahrukh vaale frem main feet ho chuke hai
 You will be shocked if you know about the property of Bollywood's Bajirao
 
 
 salmaan khan kii jagah aae bajiravagrand filmein banane ke liye mashhoor sanjay lila bhansaali bhi ranvir singh ke fain hai
 He has made requests to Devdas with Shah Rukh, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam with Salman and Hrithik
 lekin unki pichhali lagaataar 3 filmon main ranvir singh hi chhaae hue hai
 It is obvious that he has also tested Ranveer as an artist in every way
 sindhi parivaar se hai ranvir singh, is vajah se hataaya apana surnameranabira kii jagah kiya khud ko sabitado dil dhadkane do pehle ranbir kapur ko ofer kii gai thi or unki bahan kaa kirdaar karina kapur ko ofer hua tha
 In such a situation, Ranveer's superb performance of the rich boy surprised everyone
 vaise deepika kii life main bhi ranvir ne aasaani se ranbir ko riples kar diya
 He cares for Deepika so much that even 'mastani' will probably be happy with her first breakup
 bade diarector hai intjaar menadhikarik taur par naa sahi lekin ye lagbhag tay ho chukaa he ki dhooma 4 main police kii bhoomika ranvir singh nibhaayenge

 Due to the ban on demonetisation, not only the crowd of note extractors is seen outside the banks, but because of depositing old notes, banks are looking rich
 iskaa asar bhi ab dikhne laga he
 State Bank of India (SBI) has fixed interest rates on fixed deposits with select maturity periods of 0
 15 pratishat tak kii katautee kii he
 SBI has taken this step with the increase in cash following the government's ban on 500 and 1,000 rupee notes

 The smartphone with 6GB RAM, 64GB internal memory and 10 core processor will be fast
 itnaa fast kii kam se kam ek saal tak to slo hone kii samasya na ho
 But is it really so? Do smartphones with this specification not slow down or hang? Perhaps you will also know the answer if you have a high end smartphone
 ham aapako 10 aisi vajahen bataate hai jisase smartphone kii speed lagaataar kam hoti he khaas kar android divaais kii
 Reason number 1: Blotware, which comes preloaded with your smartphone
 kai companiyaan ise hataane kaa opshan band kar detii hai yani aap chaah kar bhi ise nahin hataa sakate
 These are quite a space for smartphones and if they do not clear the cache, then in a few months they play an important role in slowing down your mobile
 vajah number 2: mahatvapurn eps,inke bina aap din nahin guzaar sakate shaayad
 Apps like Facebook, youtube, Gmail and whatsapp are very heavy which use the RAM and memory of the smartphone
 vajah nabanr 3: becoground process,aapane ap band kar bhi diya he phir bhi wo becoground main chalata rahata he jo sipiu or ram kii khapat bhi karata he
 This will obviously affect the speed of the smartphone
 vajah number 4: apadats,har chote bade eps ke apadet aapako har din milenge
 As new updates are downloaded, those apps occupy more space in your device and such a process continues until you manually delete old updates or clear the cache
 aam yujar aisa nahin kar paata or din ba din uskaa smartphone slo hota jaataa he, chaahe 4jibi ram hi kyon na ho
 Reason number 5: App folders, most apps are installed in mobile as well as creating a folder that contains data stores of apps that you cannot see
 dilachasp yah he ki aapane agar us ap ko hataa bhi diya phir bhi wo foulder aapke smartphone main tabatak rahata he jabatak aap use menuali dilit nahin karte
 Many times you do not even understand why your smartphone's memory is getting full, this is also the reason
 vajah number 6: samay,samay bitta jaataa he orendroid smartphone slo hone lagate hai
 This is because new apps become heavy, take more data, have more graphics and start consuming more memory and processing power with every update
 parinaam yah hota he ki ram kaa yuj sau fisadi hone lagata he or ye hang hone lagate hai
 Reason number 7: Operating system, the operating system of any smartphone is the soul of that smartphone
 companiyaan iske nae apadet detii hai jinke jariye nae fitures or security ptch jud jate hai
 These updates settle into your smartphone and its effect is visible on your device
 vajah number 8: garm hona,jaise aapkaa dimag garm hota he to aapaki productivity par asar padataa he thik vaise hi smartphone overhit hone ke baad slo ho jaataa he
 Many times this happens due to over charging, and sometimes when running more programs than necessary
 isse isaki processing frequency bad jaati he or phone garm ho jaataa he
 As the phone heats up, the processor in it reduces the frequency so that it can cool down
 udhaaharan ke taur par agar aapane ek saath wifai, bluetooth, jeepies or enfaysi yuj kar liya to dekhie tamaasha
 Reason number 9: Bad quality, even if the hardware of your smartphone is strong but its quality will be bad, then it will create a problem for you
 yah sunishchit karnaa bhi aapke liye jaruri he ki smartphone ke andar die jane vaale hardware kii quality kya he
 Reason number 10: You may not remember when your laziness, last time is cleaning the inside of your smartphone
 browjing history, kaishe, junk files, phaltu foulder or byaap ko dhote rahete hai or dhire dhire mobile kii processing slo hone lagati he
 Therefore, it is not right to curse mobile companies only for this
 bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne ajtak channel ke sidhi baat kaarykram main hedlins today ke managing editor rahul kanwal se baatcheet kii
 Presenting the major parts
 aapane to nitin ji kaa patta hi kaat diya
 Nobody cut the leaf, everyone wanted them to complete a second term as president, but they resigned themselves if they were unjustly accused
 lekin tyaagptr pehle kyon nahin diya?pehle ham log samajhaate the to ve ruk jate the
 When Nitinji returned to Nagpur, he said that if the BJP government is formed, i will see the people of Income Tax Department
 unka kahana tha ki chaahe kisi bhi rajnatik party kii sarkaar ho, administration system ko puri tarah nishpaksh rahanaa chahie
 RSS officials were insisting that Gadkari be made the president
 aresas kii (aisi) koi jid nahin thi
 First vajpayee-advani pair and now rajnath-modi pair
 isamen do raay nahin ki narendra modi desh ke lokapriy netaa hai, par kise kya jimmedaari saunpi jaaegi, yah kor group kii baithak main tay hoga
 It is being said that keeping ahead of Narendra Modi will benefit the BJP in the 2014 elections
 main party kaa adhyaksh hum or akele nahin kah saktaa ki kya hoga? party aam sahmati se tay karegi ki kise project karnaa he, kise nahin
 Is it not a fact that Advani did not say when the name of Rajnath for the post of President came from the RSS? i have been selected by consensus
 gutbaji hoti to meraa chunaav na hota
 Home Minister (sushil Kumar) Shinde alleged that the BJP-RSS are creating terrorists and they have a hand in the attacks
 scindia sahab ko main jaankaree dena chahta hum ki rajnath singh ne bhi aresas or bijepi ke shiviron main prashikshan praapt kiya he
 Many BJP leaders have gone to the Sangh camps
 ham aatankwaadiyon ko prashikshan dete hai to sabase pehle hamen giraftaar karnaa chahie
 The Ministry of Home Affairs gave 12 names whose names are associated with the Union and action is underway on them
 scindia kaa bayaan gaiyr-jimmedaarana he
 There are many people in the Congress who have gone to the Sangh branches
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki puure sanghathan ko badnaam kar diya jaae
 But there is evidence of RSS being on hand
 to main kahata hum ki sushamaa swaraj, mujhe or arun jetali ko bhi giraftaar karnaa chahie
 Because they are all RSS volunteers
 india today kaa taaja survey bataata he ki karnataka main yediurppa gaye to party ko khatra he
 Attempt will be made to form (again) government in Karnataka
 aap vaada kar sakate hai ki aagaamee chunaavon main kisi aise vyakti ko tikat nahin milegaa, jin par aparaadhik maamle hon?agar jaankaree main hoga to nishchit taur par un logon ko tikat nahin milegaa, khaskar unako jin par rape cese chal rahaa ho
 If Sonia ji brings the Women's Reservation Bill, what will be the bjp's stand? The Women's Reservation Bill has full support

 congress or bijepi ke bich bhagava aatankwaad par aisa ghamaasan he ki bajet satr khatai main pad saktaa he
 The Home Ministry alleges that the BJP and the Sangh run terrorist camps
 saboot kahaan he?jab bhi ellection aate hai, bijepi dharm kii raajnneeti karti he
 All those responsible for some of the blasts have links with the RSS or BJP
 dharm kii raajnneeti to sabase pehle aapke sahyogi ne shuru kii
 We have never done politics of religion
 hamane insaan or insaaniyat kii raajnneeti kii he
 Recently there was a BJP meeting in which clearly BJP / RSS has said that the issue is of Ram temple
 aarope he ki sangh or bijepi aatankwaadi shivi chalaate hai
 Who was Sunil Joshi, belonged to RSS
 aakhir kyon bijepi ke netaa dhamaake ke jimmedaar logon se milane gaye?aap to scindia ji se bhi aage nikle
 The RSS is an organization whose people took part in terrorist activities
 ferj kiijie, congress ke bhi kai netaa murder or rape cese main innvolve hai par kisi ne yah nahin kaha ki congress criminals kii party he
 We did not say that BJP is a criminal party
 kuch log pakade gaye hai, jinka sambandh bijepi or aresas se he
 But where did the talk of bringing religion come from? Budget session is about to begin
 bijepi ne saaf kar diya he ki scindia kaa bahishkaar ho
 How will the session go on like this? Whenever the session is about to start, the BJP brings up some issue that the session cannot go on
 bijepi sansad main charchaa kii bajaae tivi par kyon bhaashan karnaa chaahati he?congress isse chintit he ki modi dilli aa rahe hai
 What would happen to Rahul Gandhi in such a situation? We never did politics on the basis of religion
 yah bijepi kaa khel rahaa he
 When the elections come, BJP talks about sharing
 congress ek soch or majboot netritv ke saath ladegi
 Explain why the government is continuously weakening the Lokpal? This is wrong
 lokapal ko jitna majboot kiya ja saktaa tha, hamane kiya he
 We have adopted 14 out of 16 amendments to end corruption
 congress ne ghotaalon main sabhi record tode hai
 They are all estimated losses
 lakhon karod kii baat karnaa galat he
 And the CAG report is also based on estimates
 to kya sieji siyaasi party kii tarah kaam kar rahi he?nahin, par report aane se pehle hi chijen li ho rahi hai
 There is a need to control this too
 justise verma ne report di ki kis tarah rape ke kanoonon ko sudhara jaae
 But the most important suggestions, you did not accept
 30 din main report ai or aath din main congress ne ise laane kaa kaam kiya
 This is a historic step that law has been enacted so soon

 How was the tenure of the UPA government in the last five years in these questions? Today, which is the biggest problem in the country and which party can meet your expectations? Who should become Prime Minister? Etc
 were included
 janata ne sabhi maamalon par apni bebaak raay di
 "" The first question people were asked was how did the UPA government work in the last five years? Most people termed the last five-year tenure of the UPA government as average
 19 pratishat logon ne upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal ko bahut acha bataaya jabaki 25 pratishat log ise acha maanate hai
 upa's tenure was average for 32 per cent of the people
 is tarah kul milakar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki 76 pratishat log upie sarkaar ke paksh main hai
 12 per cent of the people termed the UPA tenure as bad and 10 per cent termed it as very bad
 " "doosraa sawaal yah tha ki desh ke saamne sabase badi samasya kya he? desh ke zyaadaatar logon kii najar main aatankwaad desh ke saamne sabase badi samasya he
 39 percent of the people believe that terrorism is the biggest problem while 20 percent people think corruption is a big problem
 19 pratishat log mahangaai ko sabase badi samasya maanate hai to 18 pratishat logon ne aarthik mandi ko bhi badi samasya bataaya he
 Electricity is also a big problem for 3 percent people
 " "teesraa sawaal logon se yah poocha gaya ki aap kis mudde ko dhyaan main rakhkar vot denge? logon ne vikaas ke mudde ko sabase zyada ahmiyat di he
 The issue of development is considered to be the most important to vote by 69 percent people
 vikaas ke saamne hindutv or jatiyata kaa mudda mahatvaheen dikhataa he
 15 percent considered the candidate's image to be an important issue to vote for
 " "chauthaa sawaal logon se yah poocha gaya ki aatankwaad se behatar dhang se koun nipat saktaa he? is sawaal ke jawaab main bhi upie hi logon ke liye bharosemand sabit hui
 45 per cent of the people led by the Congress consider UPA to be more capable of dealing with terrorism while the NDA has the support of 42 per cent
 teesraa morcha keval 8 pratishat logon kii pasand ban sakaa
 "the fifth question was, whose government would be most effective in stopping the economic downturn? Congress and UPA also won
 48 pratishat log maanate hai ki upie hi mandi se kargar tareeke se nipat sakati he jabaki 42 pratishat log is mudde par endie kaa samarthan karte hai
 "the sixth question was asked to the people, who should be the next government?" In the eyes of most people, the present UPA government is good
 48 pratishat log chaahate hai ki centre main phir upie kii hi sarkaar bane jabaki 42 pratishat log chaahate hai ki bhaajapa ke netritv main endie kii sarkaar bane
 The third front also appears to be baseless here
 " "logon se saatvaan or sabase mahatvapurn sawaal yah poocha gaya ki desh kaa pradhanmantri kise bananaa chahie? is maamle main laalkrishna adwani ne baaji maar lee
 Advani is considered by 34 percent to be his first choice as Prime Minister while Manmohan Singh has the support of 32 percent

 lakhanu ke haakim tabadalon kii barsaat main masaroof hai or nizaam sudhaarney yaa bigaadane ke liye unhen abhi thode vakt kii darkaar he
 But the story of Rampur, one of the most beautiful cities in the state, is different
 yahaan ajam khan kii hukumat he
 There is no scope of committee and commission to decide right and wrong
 ajam khan kaa intervyuu64 saal ke ajam bhai (rampur vaale unhen isi tarah pukaarte hai) kii aankh kaa ishaara hi police or prashasan ke liye sahi hone kii sabase badi sanad he
 The agenda of the Akhilesh government's strong minister is fixed
 jo vaade chunaav main kiye the, unhen danke kii chot par puraa karenge
 It does not matter whether people call it retaliatory action or the wind of development
 mantri pad kii shapath lene ke ek pakhwaade ke bheetar ajam khan ne shahar main jaise bhuuchaal-sa laa diya he
 The city started getting electricity for 24 hours
 ajam ke darbar main fariyaadiyon kaa jamaavada bad gaya or unki kachhari main turat-phurat shikaayatein nibatane lageen
 Daggamar buses are closed
 nijee aspataalon ke liye jabaran fees fiks kar di gai

 Dansad raids were conducted at Kanshi Ram residences and laws were passed against ineligible people
 avaidh nirmaanon par bulldozer kii chahal kadami ho rahi he
 Why so hasty? Is there any political revenge action behind this pole of governance? aakhir loktantric mulk main koi mantri doctoron ko fees or kurashiyon ko meet ke daam tay karne ke liye kaise kah saktaa he? kya yahi khule bazaar kii arthvyavastha kaa takaza he? ise taanaashaahee kaa naam den to kya harj he?ajam kaa robinhood andaaj vaala jawaab he, ''ye dictatership nahin he, samaajwaad he
 If it is oppression to oppress the oppressors, then i am the perpetrator

 "but would have given people a chance to recover?" The direct answer of the leader, who won by more than 60,000 votes, "if it does not hold his neck now, then it would have been difficult to control him
" ''lekin unke virdohi isse ittefaq nahin rakhte
 Dr Tanveer Ahmed Khan, who contested against him on a Congress ticket, says, "azam Khan is taking political revenge action
 unheen doctoron ke aspataal band karaae gaye hai, jinhone chunaav main meri madad kii
 i am being prevented from practicing myself
 hamaare nae aspataal kaa nirmaan rukvaa diya gaya he
 "actually, his hospital is on the ground right next to the Samajwadi Party office
 doctor kaa aarope he ki ajam khan is jameen par kabja karnaa chaahate the, or aisa na hone par unhone prashasan kaa sahaara lekar nirmaan rukvaa diya
 Did Azam Khan send a direct decree to you to reduce consultancy fees or did his men come? If not, then how to force the fee to be reduced? The answer is like this, "the direct decree did not come, but the hospitals of doctors who did not reduce the fees were closed based on the rules of the Uttar Pradesh Medical Council
 council ke jin niyamon kaa dabaav banaaya gaya he, agar unka sakhti se paalan ho to puure pradesh main ek bhi nijee aspataal nahin chal saktaa
 But action is being taken only on us and our supporters
 ''doctor ke aaropon kaa jawaab dene kii jagah ajam unhen kathghare main khadaa karte hai, ''saadhe baarah sau marij ek doctor dekhtaa he

 ''ajam par doosraa aarope lagaaya rampur transport union ke adhyaksh taahir ali ne
 a dozen of Ali's buses are currently confiscated in different police stations of the city
 in bason ko is bina par jabt kiya gaya ki inke paas permit nahin hai
 Although Ali claims, "we have all the papers
" agar koi kaagaj nahin bhi he to jurmaana lekar basen chodi ja sakati hai
 But until Azam Khan says no, the buses will not leave
 '' kabhi ajam khan ke kareebi rahe ali aajkal congress ke netaa hai or unhen nagarpalika adhyaksh ke liye chunaav ladane kaa prabal daavedaar mana ja rahaa he
 There is a discussion in the city that this action has been taken to destroy their financial condition before the election
 hu-ba-hu yahi aarope shahar main band ho chuki 100 se adhik piling (plywood) mashiinon ke sanchaalak laga rahe hai, lekin ve apana naam nahin chhapavana chaahate or isaki vajah ajam kaa dar bataate hai

 K
 jain kehete hai, ''ajam shuru se hi ziddee hai
 He is really afraid 6 march ko matganana khatm hone se pehle hi tamaam badmaash shahar chhodkar bhaag gaye the
 Azam himself believes that it is not easy to understand him
 ajam ke ajmat dekhne ke liye hamane rajnatik galiyaan chhod aam aadmi kii taraf mukhaatib hone kii koshish kii
 And its biggest hallmark is seen today in the public court of Azam Khan
 rajnatik virodhiyon, kaarobaariyon or doctoron ko 'azmi samaajwaad' ke saamne ghutane techne ko majaboor karne vaale netaa kaa yahaan doosraa rup dekhne ko miltaa he
 The Janata Darbar is held in the Samajwadi Party's office on Topkhana Road, from the Durbar Hall (now the world famous Raza Library) of the former Nawab of Rampur
 nawab ke puraane darbar se is janata darbar kii duuri bamushkil 100 kadam hogi
 There is a large lawn of green grass inside when entered through a large iron door
 andar do bade-bade haul janata darbar ke hai
 One hall is zanana and the other masculine
 mantri ji ke aane se pehle hi karinde bataa dete hai ki fariyadi haul main baith jaaen
 Pardeshin women are sitting on their 50 chairs in Zanana Hall with their respective complaints
 ajam pehle yaheen aate hai
 There is also a chair for her in the hall but she remains empty
 janata darbar kii khaasiyat yahi he ki fariyadi ajam bhai ke paas nahin aata or ajam khud sabake paas chalakar jate hai
 Even during the conversation, they stand on their own and the khatus have to sit and sit
 ek-ek kar fariyaaden sunne ke baad jab ve paanch saal kii bacchee naina ke saath ai uski maa se mukhaatib hue
 So her mother said, "naina has Thalisemia
 ise khun kii jarurat he
 Azam Khan immediately gestured to the man standing behind and he took the girl to a blood bank in a car
 ek budhi aurat jab tak apni beemaari kaa bayaan karti tab tak uske liye bhi ek gaadi se aspataal bhejne kii vyavastha kar di gai
 But when some lady asked for a job, Azam clearly said, "I never made such a promise
" '' galat tareeke se kanshiram awaas main kabiz parivaar kii bedakhli radd karne kii sifarish lekar ai mahila ko bhi ajam se taka-sa jawaab mila
 And when she went to the woman minister's face with displeasure, Azam was seen smiling with peeping eyes through his thin glasses
 mardaana haul main bhi yahi intjaam tha
 Most of the complaints were related to providing houses to the poor and police cases
 kuch log yahaan bhi naukari ke khwaahishamand the
 Regarding the work that Azam takes in his JD, his direct answer is, "inshaallah (if Allah wills) will be done
" aap itminan rakhie
 "when a man came up with a recommendation to free his brother-in-law, Azam first listened patiently to him, but when he pleaded to get the brother freed, Azam got angry when the police got his beard shaved
 ''aap ne to had paar kar di
 You will make the city a disaster
 apane chor bhai ko bachaane ke liye aap fasaad karaane kii had tak ja sakate hai
 Who dares to shave someone's beard in Rampur? hamane to aaj tak nahin dekha
 My testimony of 10 years is in front of me that your brother does not shave
 is maamle ko gaur se dekhnaa padegaa
 "azam Khan has a lot of knowledge of the names, deeds, acts and intentions of the people of his city
 unke janata darbar main ve log bhi maujuud the jin par shahar main satta or jua chalaane kaa aarope he
 When one such person promised to improve further, Azam quipped, "look, you haven't improved before
" ab jab pakade ja rahe hai to sudharne kaa kaul kar rahe hai
 Improve is good, but pay for the last
 '' apni baat kehete kehete jab ek aadmi ke aansu dharak aae to ajam ne is reporter ko bulaakar kaha, ''ye suresh kumaar hai
 Of Parasupura Vaje village of Moradabad
 inaki 13 saal kii beti se 12 june, 2011 ko gangrape hua
 When the girl said that she would recognize the accused, she burst her eyes
 usne kaha aawaaj se pahchaan legi to galaa ghontkar uskaa katl kar diya
 These people have seen a lot of oppression in the last five years
 '' suresh yah fariyaad lekar aae the ki ab tak koi giraftaar nahin hui he, ajam ne bharosa dilaayaa, ''ab hogi
 "the complaints in the masculine could not be resolved until the Zanana Hall was filled once again
" or shikayaton kaa vahi daur dubaara shuru ho gaya
 And when Azam is in Lucknow, he has left three boxes to see the complaints
 dopaher tak janata darbar chalata he or uske baad ajam apane dream project mohammad ali johar vishvavidhyalay chale aae
 He is the lifetime Vice Chancellor of this private university
 250 acre jameen main faile is vishvavidhyalay ke liye jameen adhigrahan ko lekar ajam par bahut se aarope lage hai
 Many people have complained that Azam has forcibly taken possession of their land
 rampur nawab kazim ali khan urf naved miyaan kaa aarope he ki uniwarsity ke liye bade paimaane par sarkari jameen kabjai gai he
 Azam's explanation on this is, "there is not even an inch of land, whose money i have not paid from the check
" agar jameen kabjai thi to pichley paanch saal main sarkaar ne mere upar koi karrwai kyon nahin kii
 "around 9 pm, when people prepare to watch the serial on TV after having dinner, then the second chapter of Janata Durbar opens
 is adhyay main rampur ke sarkari guest house main jile ke afasar apni-apni filein lekar taiyaar rahete hai
 Azam may have a city development department, but officers of all departments, including PWD, irrigation, education, police and administration, are summoned here
 har afasar ko ajam khan se dictesan leni he, bhale hi sidhe taur par uskaa ajam khan ke vibhaag se kuch lenaa-dena na ho
 This is his parallel office where Panchayati decisions are taken on all issues
 darasal, der raat tak chalane vaala yah darbar rampur kaa asli nizaam he
 And after leaving a road from the guest house, Kothi, the luxurious collector of the Nawabi era, walks somewhere under the command emanating from here
 isiilie to jab rampur ke colector anil dhingra se shahar main chal rahi sakht karravaayiyon ke bare main poocha gaya to unka berukha jawaab tha, ''kya kuch galat ho rahaa he?''rampur main nawabon kaa asli mahal 'khaas baag' ab ujaad ho chukaa he
 The 'nur Mahal' of the current Nawabs is inhabited, but is seen as benign
 shahar kaa nayaa nawab amiri se gurbat ke din dekhne vaale divangat mumtaj khan kaa betaa he, jo rampur main typing institute chalaate the
 Azam works with his turrere and in this turrae many times the threshold of the law is exceeded, but the people of Rampur may have liked it, only then Azam bhai is his legislator for eight times
 lekin janata ke is laad-pyaar kii keemat ajam ke siyaasi rakibon ko chukaani pad rahi he, jise sahi tehraana loktantr ke liye bada jokhim hoga

 Kailash Bhiya makes the elderly pass the Vaitarani, takes care of those who have gone to heaven, when the mayor was there, people who reached God were also given pension, has anyone been able to take such care of the people? wo sadhujanon kaa saath kabhi nahin chhodte, yaad kariye jab sab asaram ko akelaa chhod rahe the to unhone kaha tha ki asaram baapu ko fansaaya ja rahaa he, peedit ladki raajnneeti se prerit aarope laga rahi he
 He also went to meet Sadhvi Pragya, accused of the Malegaon blast

They never leave the sadhus, remember when everyone was leaving Asaram alone, he said that Asaram Bapu is being implicated, the victim girl is making allegations inspired by politics
 wo maalegaanv dhamaake kii aaropee sadhvi pragna se bhi milane gaye the
 Kailash Bhiya is very straightforward and simple and these media persons distort his statement and squeeze it many times
 bhiyaa ne kah diya he hamase bade patrkaar ho kya?tippaniyan Remember, once English-speaking Arnab Goswami was also washed away, then his videos were forwarded a lot by the supporters
 madhya pradesh cricket association ke chunaav main wo jyotiraditya sindhiya kii gilli bhale kii naa uda paae hon lekin wo khilli main unka jod nahin
 We have all seen Effortless Khilli on TV, shamelessly like an Indori Seva drenched in poha, Ahaha! Had fun

 Australian captain Steve Smith has been banned for 1 match by the ICC, while he has also been fined 100 percent match fees
 iske alaava cricket australia ne smith ko captaini se bhi hataa diya he
 However, if many cricketers, including Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh, believe this punishment is quite low
 harbhajan ne isko lekar isisi kii manshaa par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 On the other hand, if you look at the rules of Cricket Australia, then according to it, Steve Smith and Cameron Bencroft can be very tough
 bhajji ne isisi ko gheraa!in khilaadiyon ko mili sajaa kii maatra se turbanetor ke naam se mashhoor harbhajan singh khush nahin hai
 He has taken a heavy toll on the ICC on this punishment
 harbhajan ne kaha he, 'vaah isisi
 Wonderful judgment and amazing impartiality

 In 2001, there was a ban on appealing more against six of our players despite no evidence
 or 2008 kaa sidney test yaad he? galati nahin pai gai, phir bhi teen maichon ke liye bain lagaaya
 You have different rules for different people
 'wow@iccwow
 Great treatment nd fairplay
 No ban for Bancroft with all the evidences whereas 6 of us were banned for excessive appealing in South Africa 2001 without any evidence and Remember Sydney 2008? Not found guilty and banned for 3 matches

 According to Rule 42, it can be imposed on a life ban

 Hours after the incident, the Australian government asked CA to remove Steve Smith from the captaincy

 Turnbull said, 'we all were disappointed by the news of South Africa in the morning
 yah puri tarah se vishwaas se pare lag rahaa tha ki australian cricket team dhokhadhadi main shaamil thi
 "what happened in the third Test? Please tell that according to Cricket Australia's website, Bencroft was seen removing a yellow object from his pants during the match
" iske baad ampiron ne unase poocha tha ki unki jeb main wo kya tha
 The video shows Bencroft putting something on the ball and then putting it back in his pocket, with Bencroft admitting it was yellow tape
 iske liye austrailia ke captain steven smith ne bhi maafee maangi thi

 Here PM Manmohan Singh said in his speech that the incidents of riots reveal a communal rift which is against the communist unity of our country and we all should be deeply concerned about it
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki doshiyon ke khilaaf jald karrwai ho
 This meeting of the NIC is being held immediately after the communal riots in Muzaffarnagar and its neighboring districts of Uttar Pradesh, thus increasing its importance
 manmohan singh ne is maukey par kaha ki aisa lagata he ki raashtra virdohi takatein sampradaayon ke bich matbhedon ko gaharaa karne or unka phayda uthaane main samay-samay par kaamyaab ho rahi hai
 The PM emphasized that communal enmity is not going to benefit anyone in the country
 unhone sabhi dalon se apil kii ki desh main sampradayik ekta ko barkaraar rakhane main madad karen
 At the same time, it said that the administration should not only stop the small incidents from becoming big, but also get the people responsible for the communal violence punished at the earliest

 On this occasion, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed concern over the safety of women in the country and said that there is a need to change the mindset to prevent crime against women
 unhone kaha, 'yah shame kii baat he ki mahilaon ke saath uchit vyavhaar nahin ho rahaa he
 Hopefully, this conference will bring good suggestions for prevention of violence against women
 ' unhone kaha, "desh kaa tabhi vikaas hoga, jab mahilaayein aazaadee se baahar aa-ja sakengi, aazaadee se faisle le sakengi
 We need to change the mindset to stop crime against women
 'apane bhaashan main piem ne anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati or anya kamazor tabakon ke viruddh ho rahe atyaachaar bhi chintaa jataai he

 loksabhaa chunaav main desh ke anya hisson main beshak modi kii aandhi chali ho lekin punjab main mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne apane raajnneetik kad ko or ooncha kiya
 Of the 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab, the Congress captured 8 seats
 modi factor samet tamaam jhanjhaavaton ko sahane ke baavjood amarinder singh ne captain kii pari kheli
 Whether it is the Badal family associated with the Shiromani Akali Dal or the BJP or the Aam Aadmi Party, no one has got a chance to make a dent in the 'political sultanate' of the 'maharaja' in Punjab
 loksabhaa chunaav main punjab ke nateezon ne sabit kiya ki captain nirvivaad leader hai
 In the Congress itself, among his opponents, Congress leader and Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, his wife Navjot Kaur Sidhu, besides Pratap Singh Bajwa are also considered
 lekin in sab virodhiyon ko punjab ke nateezon ne baikfoot par dhakel diya he
 Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was on the backfoot with the 'friendly Match' comment and Punjab results, campaigned in Bathinda and Gurdaspur out of the 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab
 ye donon hi siten congress haar gai
 The Captain and some of his cabinet colleagues have demanded action against Sidhu for making a statement against his own party
 bataa den ki siddhu ne ek chunaav raily main dabi jubaan main congress or akali dal kii or se ‘frandli match’ khele jane kii baat kahi thi
 This disputed statement was made by Sidhu at Bathinda rally
 yahaan congress ummidavaar ko akali dal kii harsimrat cor ke saamne maat khaani padi
 The Captain said that Sidhu's statement damaged the image of the Congress
 captain ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki ve jaldi hi congress haikaman ke saamne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan siddhu ke party ko nuksaan pahunchane vaale bayaan kaa mudda uthaaenge jisaki vajah se bathinda seat par party nahin jeet saki
 When asked about the impact of Sidhu's statement on the performance of Congress in Punjab, the captain did not give any direct answer
 captain ne isaki jagah kaha ki siddhu ke pradarshan kii samiksha kii jaani chahie
 The Captain pointed out that the Congress did not do well in urban areas whereas Sidhu is the Minister for Urban Development
 captain ke mutabik har kisi ko apane ko pramot karne kaa haq he lekin ek baar chunavi jang shuru ho jane ke baad siddhu kii ore se vivaadit bayaan diya janaa sahi nahin tha
 The Chief Minister reiterated that our soldiers cannot tolerate 'yari and Jhappi' along with the head of Sidhu's Pakistan Army

 In Gurdaspur, the Congress was able to take a decisive lead in 8 seats behind the defeat of Punjab Congress President in Gurdaspur, but in Gurdaspur, the party's state president Sunil Jakhar had to face defeat in front of actor and BJP candidate Sunny Deol
 kaha ja rahaa he ki unhen purv punjab congress adhyaksh pratap singh bajva kaa samarthan nahin mila, jinhen captain ke virdohi kheme kaa mana jaataa he
 Bajwa was extremely angry when the Captain introduced Sunil Jakhar as the future Chief Minister of Punjab
 haalanki captain ne ye baat gurdaspur ke hindu votaron ko lubhaane ke liye kahi thi lekin ye bajva ko nagavar gujri thi
 Bajwa distanced himself from the party's campaign in Gurdaspur
 gaiyr jamaanti aparaadhon main ab agrim jamaanat kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 After the President's approval for the amendment related to anticipatory bail, the Yogi government of the state has issued its notification
 haalanki isko lekar kai sari sharten bhi lagaai gayi he
 Let me tell you that before that there were many such sections on which advance bail was not available
 is nae niyam ke anusaar, agrim jamaanat kii sunwaayee ke dauraan ab abhiyukt kaa upasthit rahanaa jaruri nahin hoga
 Also, during which time the accused will be called for questioning, the accused will have to appear before the police officer or the discretion
 itnaa hi nahin, aavedak maamle se jude gavaahon or anya vyaktiyon ko ab kisi bhi tarah se dhamka nahin sakenge or naa hi kisi tarah kaa aashwaasan de sakenge
 But apart from all these cases, this advance bail facility will not be available in SC / ST Act
 yani agrim jamaanat kii jo suvidha jo milane ja rahi he, vah SC / ST act samet gambhir aparaadh maamalon main lagu nahin hogi
 Also, cases related to terrorist activities (unlawful Activities Act 1967), Official Act, Narcotics Act, Gangster Act and death penalty cases will not get advance bail
 nae prastaav kii maane to vidheyak ke tahat agrim jamaanat ke liye jo bhi aavedan aaenge unke aane kii tithi se 30 din ke andar nistaaran karnaa hoga
 The court will also be required to send notice to the Public Prosecutor seven days before the final hearing
 agrim jamaanat se jude maamalon main court abhiyog kii prakruti or gambhirtha, aavedak ke itihaas, uski nyaay se bhaagane kii pravriti or aavedak ko apamaanit karne ke uddeshy se lagaae gaye aarope par vichaar kar uske aadhaar par faisla le sakati he

 usase ne yah bhi bataaya ki use naa to uske mata pita se baat karne di jaati thi or naa hi use thik se khaanaa diya jaataa tha
 Telling her point, the girl started crying and told to take it from there
 mahila ayog kii team ne bacchee ko le jane kii koshish kii to uske maalik ne hangaamaa karnaa shuru kar diya
 The commission team then informed the Delhi Police and the police reached the spot

 bacchee ko chikitsiya pareekshan ke liye aspataal le jaaya gaya
 The girl was presented before the Child Welfare Committee from where she has been sent to the shelter home
 dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne kaha, 'naaballig bacchiyon ke saath utpeedan ke badhate maamalon ko dekh kar mujhe bahut chintaa hoti he
 i do not understand how people from such educated and good families treat poor children so badly
 kya unke andar insaaniyat bilkul nahin he? main sabhi laagon se apil karti hum ki agar unhen apane aasapaas kuch bhi galat ghatit hota hue dikhe to turant hamen soochna den taaki ham karrwai kar saken
 ' rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke 22wein sthapana diwas par 5 july ko jab tej pratap party kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karne ke liye khadey hue, tab chote bhai tejasvi ne aahiste-se unase kaha ki 'jaldi nibata dena'
 The elder Yadav got upset and made this statement in a full meeting
 tej pratap ne kaha, ''tejasvi soch rahe honge ki mujhe unako bolne kaa mauka dena chahie
 i will give ve shaam kii udaan se dilli ja rahe hai
 Then i will handle everything here
 ''unhone khud kii tulana 'uhapoh main fanse arjuna' ke saamne khadey 'bhagwaan krishna' se kii or apane pita lalu prasad yadav ke andaaje-bayaan kaa istemaal karte hue parivaar main khud ke senior hone kaa daawa kiya
 During this time, Tejashwi was looking uncomfortable
 yah pehla mauka nahin tha jab bade bhai ne man kii baat khuleam bayaan kii thi
 In June, he expressed his dislike by tweeting how "some people are upset with my emergence as kingmaker"
 '' phir unhone party ko chalaane ke dhang ko lekar pradesh adhyaksh ramchandra purve kii aalochana kii
 He alleged that he was being ignored within the party and reminded him repeatedly of his 'pressure'
 lalu ke bade bete khud ko sambhavit vidrohi ke taur par pesh kar rahe hai
 Both the family and the party are not in a position to ignore it
 tej pratap ko pehle utani ahmiyat nahin di jaati thi
 But now they are trying to create their new image
 party ke baahar or bheetar donon jagah virodhiyon par hamale karte hue ve khud ko lalu ke saanche main dhale jan netaa ke taur par pesh karne kii besakhta koshishen kar rahe hai
 On 9 July, he went to his constituency Mahua
 yahaan puraa din unhone cycle rickshaw par sawari ganthte, mahadaliton ke saath farsh par baithkar sattu khate or phone par sarkari afasaron ko hadakaate or bheed ko spikar par yah baatcheet sunwaate hue bitaayaa
 He even stopped and bathed at a public hand pump
 rajd ke kai logon kaa kahana he ki may main shaadi ke baad se tej pratap badal gaye hai
 Wife Aishwarya Roy is believed to be the reason for this new avatar
 lalu aksar unhen 'sone ke dil vaala aadmi' kehete rahe hai
 He is not as eloquent as Tejashwi, but when he speaks, he speaks docotically and frankly, and at times, suddenly erupts
 tejasvi unke mukaable khaase shisht or chatur hai
 As the leader of the opposition in Bihar, he has been a good and politically correct version of Lalu Prasad
 unhen is baat kaa shrey jaataa he ki july 2017 main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke rishta tod lene ke baad hue teen upachunaavon main unhone apane dam par party ko jitayaa he
 Despite his strong statements, Tej Pratap has a loving association with Tejashwi
 may main shaadi main or june main lalu kii janmdin party main donon khub milakar naache
 Tej Pratap also promised to find a bride for Tejashwi soon
 kam se kam logon ke saamne to ve jigari dost kii tarah najar aate hai
 Tej Pratap still calls younger brother his 'piece of heart' and Tejashwi says that elder brother is his 'friend and guide'
 magar unhone aalochana or twit main saaf taur par party ke kaamkaaj ke tareeke par ungliyaan uthaai hai, jise lalu kii gairmaujuudagi main har lihaaj se unke chote bhai chalaa rahe hai
 "they are not jealous that Lalu chose Tejashwi to lead the party," says a senior RJD leader
 magar tej pratap doum darje kii bhoomika nibhaane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 
 
 They want equal status
 ''par rajd yah jhagada jhelane kii sthiti main nahin he kyonki loksabhaa chunaav agle hi saal hone hai
 The harmony between the two brothers will decide how big a challenge the RJD can present for Narendra Modi and the NDA
 ''main sochataa hum ki main hastinapur kii gaddi arjuna ko saunpkar dwarka chalaa jaaoongaa
 
 
 Some cheaters still think that i am becoming a kingmaker

 The enmity between comedians Kapil Sharma and Krishna Abhishek is well known
 donon aksar ek-duusare ke khilaaf bayaanbaji bhi karte rahete hai
 Sometime back, Krishna Abhishek has come up with a new show
 is sho ke lonching event ke dauraan bhi krishna ne kaha tha ki unki or kapil kii koi tulana nahin kii ja sakati
 Sister Disclosed- Comedian Kapil Sharma, who is struggling with depression, in a recent interview to Hindustan Times, Krishna talked about his and Kapil's relationship
 unhone kaha- log ab cilebs kaa intervyuu dekhakar bor ho gaye hai
 If you have to watch the syllabus interview then you will see 'coffee with Karan'
 kalakaaron se ek hi tarah ke sawaal puche jate hai
 So we have to be different
 isliye hamane sochaa ki kyon naa tivi par theatre laayaa jaae
 Kapil, who was unconscious on the set again, was walking with the team of the film Mubarakan and it is clear that Krishna's gesture is towards Kapil's show
 kapil hi apane sho main kalakaaron ke intervyuu lete hai
 Krishna also denied that he imitated Kapil for success
 krishna ne kaha- maine kapil se apni tulana kabhi nahin kii
 Our style is completely different
 kapil bas van liners bolte hai
 i give performance
 kya wo apni sho main ek ghante parform karte hai?kapil ke sho par kumaar vishwaas ne mahilaon ko kaha samanmen ek ghante parform karata hum
 This is the difference between us
 log kehete hai ki mujhe kapil se problem he
 But there is nothing like that
 main kabhi stand ap kamedian nahin bananaa chahta tha
 But i have done so much comedy that i have moved into the stand up comedian's zone
 soshal media ke hazaron phaayde ginaae jate hai, lekin iske nuksaan bhi kam nahin hai

 On the other hand, this rumor has been denied outright on microblogging website Twitter, and those who broadcast this fake news on 'whatsapp' are also being criticized
 ullekhneey he ki lagbhag 20 saal tak paak cricket kii seva karne ke baad imran khan ne varsh 1996 main ek nai party 'taharik-e-insaaf' kaa gathan kar raajnneeti main pravesh kiya tha, haalanki unhen kabhi koi badi kamyaabi hasil nahin hui
 Recently Imran Khan took out a procession accusing the party of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of rigging the elections, which allegedly involved thousands of people
 imran khan ne pradhanmantri ke khilaaf die bhaashan main yah bhi kaha tha, "agar mujhe kuch ho jaataa he, to sharif parivaar ko chhodana nahin
 
 
 " iske alaava pakistan ke ek dharmik netaa taahir ul-kadri ne bhi imran khan ke saath aakar nawaz sharif ke khilaaf abhiyaan chhedaa, or apane samarthakon ke bich bhaashan dete hue kaha, "agar meri hatya ho jaati he, to mere anuyaayiyon ko pradhanmantri nawaz sharif, unke puure parivaar or cabinet ko zarur maar daalana chahie

 After leaving the meeting, Sonia Gandhi said in response to the question of journalists that in the case of Ishrat Jahan, the party is fully with p Chidambaram
 vah pehle hi apana paksh rakh chuke hai
 Asked whether the Congress leadership is also being targeted by the BJP, Sonia replied that there is nothing new in this
 ve congress ko tab se nishaanaa bana rahe hai, jab ham satta main the
 According to sources, in this meeting of the Congress, it was also decided that the party will respond fiercely to the allegations on the Ishrat case
 avar sachiv aarvies mani par ye kah kar sawaal uthaaya jayega ki ye vahi adhikari hai, jinhone kaha tha ki sansad par hamale ko vaajapeyi sarkaar ne plan kiya tha or mumbai hamalaa upie sarkaar ne plan kiya tha
 Does BJP want to trust the words of such an officer

 The comments gauratlab he ki 29 farvari ko congress mukhyalay main yojit apni ek press conference main ishrat ke maamle main halafanama badale jane ke sawaal par chidambaram ne saafe kiya tha ki ishrat ke aatanki hone se jude sabooton kii kami ke aadhaar par court ne hi us par sawaal uthaae the
 It was also said that things were not clear in the first affidavit and it was brought to their notice

 a letter sent by the Congress on Wednesday to the NIA in 2011 to the Ahmedabad SIT was also issued, in which David Coleman Headley's statement was not recognized as evidence in the court, as his statement was heard
 was based on
 congress ne yah bhi saafe kiya ki 6 agast 2009 ko daakhil halafanaame main ishrat ko lashkar kaa aatanki or encounter ko asli mana gaya tha
 But on 7 September 2009, Metropolitan Magistrate SP Tamang not only called the encounter as fake, but also said that Ishrat and her partner Javed Sheikh were members of the Pakistani terror outfit lashkar-e-taiba
 yah bhi ki ve narendra modi ko maarane aae the ye bhi sabit nahin hota
 Keeping this decision of the court in mind, another affidavit was filed on 29 September

 The Congress also clarified that in the affidavit filed on August 6, 2009, Ishrat was considered a Lashkar terrorist and the encounter was genuine
 lekin 7 sitambar 2009 ko metropolitain magistrate es pi tamang ne na sirf encounter ko farzi qaraar diya, balki yah bhi kaha ki ishrat or uskaa saathi javed shaikh pakistani aatanki sanghathan lashkar e taiyaba ke sadsy the, ye bataane ke liye thos saboot nahin hai

 Janata Dal United (JDU) mlas are waiting for cabinet expansion in Bihar, but Nitish Kumar repeatedly says that there is no thought on this yet
 vipakshi dalon kii chunauti he ki jis din nitish kumaar mantri pad ke sabhi rikt padon ko bharenge, usee din unki sarkaar gir jaayegi
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has the responsibility of the entire state, but at the same time he is also responsible for 18 departments
 bijepi se gathbandhan tuutane ke baad pehle se 7 vibhaagon ko dekh rahe nitish kumaar par 11 vibhaagon kii jimmedaari or bad gai

 saath hi vipaksh kaa ye bhi daawa he ki jis din puure mantri padon ko bhar diya jaayegaa, us din nitish kumaar kii sarkaar gir jaaegi
 When the alliance was broken, the JDU mlas were hopeful that their days would turn around and they too would turn around on a red light carriage, but two months were to pass and their hopes remained unfulfilled till now
 jediu ke adhiktar vidhayak mantri banane ke sapane dekh rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is not only difficult for Nitish Kumar to give the position to everyone

 On Sunday, Nitish Kumar met the Governor, when Aas Kiran burst, but Nitish Kumar said that it was a formal meeting, there was no discussion about cabinet expansion
 haalanki mantrimandal kaa vistaar nitish kumaar ko aaj nahin to kal to karnaa hi hoga
 It is believed that someday after August 15, some will get a chance to become a minister

 ) Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream is to take the country's economy to 5 trillion dollars in the next 5 years
 saal 2018 main unhone switzraland ke daavos main sabase pehle saal 2025 tak bharat ko 5 trillian dollar iconomi banane kii baat kahi thi
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman reiterated the same while presenting the budget
 lekin agle paanch saal main bharat ke 5 trillian dollar iconomi banane main koi rukaawat dikhaai nahin detii
 This is not a difficult thing
 bharat isse tej bhi vikaas kar saktaa he
 According to a Business Today report, India is growing faster than the pace needed to become a $ 5 trillion economy
 notebandi jaise jatke ke baavjood vikaas ke har paimaane (11 or 12% prativarsh ke bich) par bharat 2025 tak 5 trillian dollar kaa target hasil kar legaa basharte rupaya-dollar kii dar lagbhag 70 rupee ho
 But by 2024, India could be a little over 5 trillion on every development scale
 aisa kaise hogadollar main jidipi ko imef yaa world bank maapta he
 They calculate (nominal) GDP from India's GDP at current prices
 agar 190 lakh karod rupee par 2018-19 main bharat kii jidipi dekhen to yah 2
 The economy sits at $ 71 trillion (at an average of Rs
 70 per dollar)
 report ke mutabik, bharat 11 pratishat jidipi kii salanaa vikaas dar se 2024-25 main 5 trillian dollar iconomi, 11
 5 at the rate of 25 percent per year
 15 trillian dollar prati varsh, 11
 5 at the rate of 5 percent annually
 22 trillian or 12 pratishat salanaa kii dar se 5
 a $ 36 trillion economy could be built
 ek doosraa tarika he, jisamen sthir keemton se jidipi ko mapa jaataa he
 The GDP is linked to the base year, which is currently 2011-12
 isamen 'asli jidipi' ko mapa jaataa he, jisamen mahangaai kaa prabhaav shaamil nahin hota
 India's GDP stands at around Rs 140 lakhs at the situated prices
 yah sthir keemton par jidipi kii tulana main puure 50 lakh karod rupee kam he
 In this way, it was just a $ 2 trillion economy
 isse saaf he ki na to sarkaar or na hi imef / world bank is aankade kaa sahaara le rahaa he
 The nominal GDP or current prices of the World Bank are the annual inflation and GDP of fixed prices
 isliye bharat agar 2025 tak 7-7
 Real GDP records an average growth rate of 5 percent per annum and inflation is in the range of 4 percent, so there will be no problem for India to become a $ 5 trillion economy
 isliye bharat ko ab or bada khwab dekhnaa chahie

 haalanki, silband lipaphe main jawaab daakhil karne par hindu pakshakaron ne aapatti bhi jataai he
 Ramlala Virajaman and Hindu Mahasabha have written a complaint in this case to the Supreme Court Secretary General
 jisamen unhone kaha ki supreme court kii paanch sadasyeey peeth ne apane aadesh main kahin nahin kaha ki molding of relif par jawaab sil cover main daakhil kiya jaae
 In such a situation, the Sunni Waqf Board's reply should not be accepted nor should it be placed before the five-member bench
 supreme court main molding of relif ke tahat ayodhya vivaad se jude tamaam pakshakaron ne apana apana jawaab daakhil kiya
 It has information from the Sunni Waqf Board that they are ready for a compromise but other Muslim parties have denied it
 hindu paksh kii ore se nirmohi akhaada ne ramalala yaa kisi bhi hindu pakshakaar ke paksh main faisla hone par apane sevaayat adhikaar ko barkaraar rakhe jane kii baat kahi he
 Apart from building a temple on the disputed land, Ramlala should also have the right to the responsibility of service worship and order
 vahiin, ramalala virajman ne likhaa he ki ram mandir ke liye sara kshetra use diya jaae
 The Nirmohi Akhara or Muslim parties should not get any share of the land
 hindu mahasabha ne likhaa he ki ayodhya main janmasthan par ram mandir ke nirmaan par puri mandir kii vyavastha ke liye supreme court ek trust banaae
 If talking about the Muslim side, according to sources, the Muslim side said that they want the same relief that they had said during the debate
 yani unhen vidhwans se pehle kii haalat vaali babari masjid chahie
 At the same time, information has come from the Sunni Waqf Board that they are in favor of the agreement
 ayodhya maamle main shiya vakf board ne kaha, 'hamane molding of relif ke jariye bhi hoicourt se muslimon ko di gai bhoomi par daawa chhodane kii baat kahi he
 Temples were built there
 'molding of relif par shiya vakf board ne bhi supreme court main likhit jawaab daakhil kiya
 The Shia Waqf Board said that Lord Ram's temple should be built on the disputed land, the land is not owned by the Sunni Waqf Board, but by the Shia Waqf Board
 aise main hai court ne ek hissaa jo sunni vakf board ko diya he use hindu paksh ko diya jaae
 Looking at the answers of all the parties, one thing is coming out that there is some flexibility in the attitude of some parties
 sunni vakf board to samjhaute ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 At present, the judges of the Supreme Court will be writing the verdict after the debate
 lekin us faisle se pehle tamaam pakshon kii ore se aae jawaab par bhi jarur gaur farmaaya jayega
 This is also expected
 kendriya mantri nitin gadakari (nitin Gadkari) ne apane saathi netaaon ko salaah di he
 He said that leaders should not interfere in other fields, but should let the people of universities, educational institutions, literature and poetry world settle their own affairs
 nitin gadakari (nitin Gadkari) ne yah batyavatmal main salanaa marathi sahitya sammelan ke samaapan samaaroh main kahi
 Let me tell you that this conference has been in controversy due to withdrawal of invitation given to writer Nayantara Sehgal
 kaarykram main gadakari ne kaha ki ‘apatkaal ke dauraan durga bhagwat or piel deshpandey jaise marathi lekhakon ke bhaashanon ke dauraan raajnneetik reliyon se zyada bheed jutati thi
 Both these people returned to the field of literature after the elections
 unhone yahaan tak ki rajyasabha kii sadsyta jaisi raajnneetik niyukti kii bhi maang nahin kii thi'
 Durga was openly critical of the Emergency, while Deshpande campaigned for the Janata Party after the Emergency was lifted and elections were announced in 1977

 Actually, Karan Johar shared the posters of this film and praised the film and wrote, 'shabash Swara Tumhari for your continuous efforts
 ' karan ne is twit main film kii tarif bhi kii
 Replying to Karan's tweet, Kamal wrote, "according to Karan Johar Sir KRK, this film will not be a flop or a waste, but it will be a super-dubious nonsense film of the year
" ' Sir @karanjohar it will not be a flop or washout, but it will be super duper disaster of the year coz KRK says so

 The price of one kg of tomatoes has reached 80 to 100 rupees per kg in retail mandis of Delhi
 yahi nahin, anya subjiyon ke daam bhi aasmaan chune lage hai
 Due to this, the pressure on the common man's pocket is increasing
 lagaataar bad rahe damadilli kii retail mandiyonmen saamaanya tamaato 80 rupee prati kilo mil rahaa he, to desi tamaato ke liye 100 rupee chukaane pad rahe hai
 The prices of vegetables are constantly increasing
 dilli hi nahin, dehradun, noida samet anya jagahon par bhi subjiyon ke daam main badhottaree dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Unseasonal rain is responsible for selling vegetable vendors in Mandi Mandi that earlier the number of trucks filled with tomatoes was reduced
 iske liye kuch ilaakon main bemausham hui barish ko jimmedaar mana ja rahaa he
 The rain in these areas has spoiled the tomato crop
 is vajah se aapurti main khalal padaa he, lekin ye sirf ek vajah nahin he keemten badhane kii
 Unseasonal rain or the government's negligence? It is certainly that the rainless rain played an important role in raising tomato prices, but the government's negligence is also responsible for this

 Not giving preference to low yield warnings
 After this warning, it was necessary that the country was given more preference to keep the crop in cold storage than exporting, so that the stock can be used to curb the rising prices in the present time
 Could, but it did not
 agast se mil rahaa aashwaasanaupabhokta maamalon ke mantri ramvilas paswan ne kaha he ki jald badhati keemten niyantrit ho jaaengi
 He informed that as tomato supply increases, prices will start to decline
 haalanki agast maheene main bhi sarkaar ne kuch isi tarah kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 In August too, the government had said that prices would come under control, but this did not happen

 Malik said these things while speaking to reporters in Karachi
 unhone iske saath pakistani khilaadiyon ko kuch salaah bhi deen
 Malik said that the World Cup semi-final between India and Pakistan will be very exciting
 unhone kaha, ‘cricketron ko sabhi bahut pasand karte hai or hamen ummid he ki ve hamaare liye match jeetenge
 We hope they do not disappoint Awam

 thakare ne kaha he ki aise khulaase ke jariye kalam ne apana hi vastraharan karaayaa he or apni hi chhavi ko thes pahunchaai he
 Thackeray has written that Sonia had made a lot of efforts to become a PM but could not become one, that is why a dumb and deaf person was made PM
 thakare kaa kahana he ki log samajhate the kalam ne hi sonia ko pradhanmantri banane se roka tha isiilie logon ke man main unke prati aadar tha lekin kalam ne ye khulaasa karke khai main chalaang lagaakar apane hi haath-pair tudwa liye hai

 thakare ne saamana main likhaa he ki kalam ko iske aage koi bhi missile main naa kahe kyonki unhone das saal tak sach ko chhipaae rakhaa

 a day after making a controversial statement on Sachin Tendulkar, former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi on Sunday said that this champion batsman of India does not need his certificate and he himself is a big fan of Sachin
 afridi ne kaha, sachin tendulkar bahut aalaa ballebaaj he or duniya unke fan kaa loha maanati he
 They do not need my or anyone else's certificate
 unka ricard iskaa gavaah he ki vah kis darje ke cricketer hai
 Afridi, surrounded by controversies, supported his former teammate Shoaib Akhtar's claim that Sachin Tendulkar was uncomfortable with his pace
 afridi ne kaha tha ki unhone sachin ko shoeb ke saamne kaanpate dekha tha
 Afridi upheld this statement and said, i am not retracting that i saw it
 vah 1999 ke bharat daure par kolkata test kii baat he jisamen shoeb ne sachin or dravid ko out kiya tha
 It was just a match, but after that Sachin beat Shoaib heavily, including the 2003 World Cup
 unhone kaha, us samay shoeb nayaa tha or uske paas gajab kii raftaar thi
 No batsman of the world could stand in front of him
 sirf usee ek match main maine sachin ko ghabaraate dekha kyonki main square leg par khadaa tha
 i have not said anything wrong
 afridi ne kaha, kisi bhi ballebaaj ke saath aisa ho saktaa he
 It was Shoaib's day and i have no qualms about what i said
 us match main sachin nervas tha lekin is baat ko media ne anaavashyak tool de diya
 It can be difficult for anyone to face a good bowler on a good wicket, even if it is Don Bradman
 kolkata main 1999 main khele gaye us test main shoeb ne pehali pari main sachin ko khaataa kholane kaa mauka diye bina bold kar diya tha
 Dravid was the victim of Shoaib in both innings
 pakistan ke is purv tej gendbaaj ne apane pehle bharat daure par us match main aath wicket chatkaye the
 Afridi said, i do not mean to say that Shoaib has an edge over Sachin
 sachin ne baad main shoeb par kitne chakke udaaye hai, sabhi ko pataa he
 But there is never a batsman's day
 peshawar main zimbabwe ke khilaaf ek match main main jiro par out ho gaya tha jabaki us samay main jabardast farm main tha or saamne kamjor team thi
 Describing himself as a great fan of Sachin, he said, i am convinced of Sachin who is not only a good cricketer but also a great person
 maine apane ghar ke drawing room main kisi or cricketer kii photo nahin lagaai lekin sachin ke aatograph vaali tasviir frem karke lagaai he
 Asked if he would talk to Sachin in this matter, he said, "sachin is a great cricketer and he must understand that i have not said anything wrong
" afridi ne bhartiya media ko tangadil qaraar dete hue kaha ki media ko donon mulkon ke sambandh behatar banane kii disha main kaam karnaa chaiye lekin bhartiya media aisa nahin kar rahaa
 He said, even after we went to play the World Cup this year, the Indian media ran negative news about the Pakistani team
 bhartiya avam se hamen bahut pyaar mila or pakistan main bhi bharatiyon khaskar sachin ke chaahane waalon kii kami nahin he
 Media should avoid negative news
 antarrashtriya cricket se sanyas le chuke afridi ne vaapasi kii sambhaavna ke bare main kaha, eenshallah main jald hi vaapasi karuunga
 i think i can play two to three years more
 haal hi main raashtrapati or pisibi ke sangrakshak asif ali jaradaari se mulaakaat karne vaale is harfanmaulaa ne kaha, main kisi ke saamne gidgidaane vaala nahin hum lekin mujhe lagata he ki halaat anukool banenge or main phir pakistan ke liye khel sakuunga

 If there is some charisma, then i cannot say
 ' unhone aage kaha ki din pratidin hamaari sthiti pehle se behatar hoti ja rahi he

 Maneka Gandhi says that her son Varun Gandhi also made Sultanpur his karma area and did great things for development
 ab wo khud is baar sultanpur kii seva karne ai hai
 Maneka Gandhi in her speech describes the poor welfare schemes of the Modi government, that the Modi government gave five lakh rupees for the treatment of poor people under Ayushman Bharat Yojana, loans have been given for work in Mudra Yojana

 ab aapako tay karnaa he ki kise chunanaa he kyonki bandookdhaari ne 15 karod rupye main tikat kharida he
