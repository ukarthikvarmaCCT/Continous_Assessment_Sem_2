 kolkata ke captain gautam gambhir shandaar form main nazar aa rahe hai, or na sirf ballebaazi se, balki captaini se bhi diggajon kii shaabassiyaan bator rahe hai
 
 
 Cricket experts are also convinced of his batting as well as his captaincy, as Gambhir has done many experiments this time, giving his team victory in six out of eight matches

 aam aadmi party kisi netaa ko rajyasabha kaa tikat nahin degi
 Sources say that the party will send an expert to the Rajya Sabha in place of the leader
 party ke is rukh se kumaar vishwaas kii mahatvakankshaon par pani phirata najar aa rahaa he jo sawarjanik rup se rajyasabha jane kii ichha jaahir kar chuke hai

 The term of three Rajya Sabha members Janardan Dwivedi, Parvez Hashmi and Karan Singh from Delhi ends in January 2018 and continues on the same issue with the internal tussle of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party of Delhi, which currently has party leader and poet Kumar Vishwas
 haalanki aap ke mukhya pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj aap main gutbaji or khinchataan par tikhi pratikriya dete hue bhaajapa par nishaanaa sadhate hai
 Bhardwaj says, "the mainstream media is influenced by the BJP

 "on the issue of factionalism, you say whether Shatrughan Sinha and Yashwant Sinha's activities are not factionalizing the BJP

 On the other hand, Kumar Vishwas has already said that my supporters want me to go to Rajya Sabha
 aisi tamanna rakhane vaale netaaon kii sankhya or zyada ho sakati he
 The perception in AAP is from top to bottom that Kumar Vishwas is close to the BJP leaders and that is why the party is not paying much attention to them now
 yahaan tak ki unke kisi aarope yaa sawaal par party ne koi pratikriya na dene kaa faisla kiya he
 However, when the AAP leadership opens its cards for the Rajya Sabha in 2018, the names will certainly be over, but the possibility of a new air of discontent cannot be ruled out

 When the communal elements within the Congress party took over the party in the mid-fifties, the specter of communalism that emerged after the partition of India began to dominate again, but in the middle of 1951 when Nehru again took control of the Congress If taken, this apparition was suppressed

 janata party or aresas kii dohari sadsyta ke sawaal par unhen apni hi pangat main jaldi hi darkinar kar diya gaya
 But when the second year of Rajiv Gandhi's tenure as Prime Minister began, communalism had reared its head from February 1986, mainly due to the order of the Sessions Judge of Faizabad district that month in which the doors of Babri Masjid / Ramlala Temple It was said to be opened

 Taking unexpected steps in this debate, the Prime Minister allowed two of his ministers to express different views on that proposal

 In the judgment, Rs

 or kuch paise guzaara bhatta dene kii pushti kii gai thi
 Rather, these views were more related to the comments made in the judgment that seemed to have violated or challenged the Muslim personal law
 haalanki muslim mahila vidheyak kaa uddeshy pehle se tay kanoon ko or majboot karnaa tha, ki khaas taur se tangi ke bare main faujadaari kanoon ke praavdhaan sabhi samudaayon ko sanvaidhanik guarantee dene kii baat ko kamjor nahin karenge

 At the same time, communal tension was spreading in the country at that time due to terrorist activities in Punjab, which started in 1978 in a fierce fight between two constituents of the same sect
 oparation bluestar ne aag main ghi kaa kaam kiya
 Overall, the most serious challenge to the secular tradition of the country was posed by the bitter experience of the bloodshed split in Ayodhya, the Shahbano controversy and the communal terrorism in Punjab
 rajeev gandhi ne sansad main dharmanirpekshata ko ''rashtriyata kaa majboot jod'' bataate hue jo bayaan diya tha vah dharmanirpekshata par sansad main diya gaya bada bayaan tha
 But despite the public apologies and frequent legal actions by Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi, the manner in which the killings of Sikhs took place for three days after Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister raises doubts about his secular image
 unki shahadat ke bees saal baad, yah mahatvapurn he ki ham is aarope par tatasth bhav se dobaaraa vichaar karen ki ''bada ped'' girane kii baat karke rajeev gandhi ne us sampradayik unmaad ko badhaava diya yaa uski andekhi kii jisane indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad rajdhani or desh ke anya bhaagon ko giraft main le liya tha

 According to this decision, the number of soldiers in Delhi was kept low to prevent the possibility of any coup
 nae yuva pradhanmantri ke faisle ne sthiti ko puri tarah badal diya
 The storm of misinformation about the events of those terrible days of the beginning deliberately promoted the lie that Rajiv Gandhi had cited the "big tree" in his first message to the nation after assuming office
 is afvaah kaa khandan jaruri he
 When all forms of violence stopped in Delhi and other places, displaced people were given shelter in the camps, and relief and rehabilitation measures were started, then after a fortnight Rajiv Gandhi did this in a huge rally at the Boat Club
 Commented
 yah raily 19 november ko indira gandhi ke janmdin par yojit kii gai thi
 The words he actually used, and the context in which the "big tree" was spoken, need to be looked into in detail
 is baat par jor dete hue ki ''gusse main uthaaya gaya koi bhi kadam desh ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he'' or ''gusse main koi bhi kaam karke ham keval un logon kii madad karte hai jo desh ko todna chaahate hai'' unhone chetavanee di thi ki ''hamaara gussa yaa hamaara dukh badla lene kaa kaaran nahin bananaa chahie
 "from the beginning of the violence, in all his speeches he was cautioning everyone against such anger (" Don't shed blood, give up hate ")
 He himself followed it till the end
 iske baad hi unhone 'huek vishaal ped'' ke girane kaa chaltau zikr kiya tha
 And to cut this image out of context, he was told that he had made this statement before the violence, when this statement was made when the violence itself was prevented by someone else
 or is jumale ke thik baad jo baat unhone kahi, usamen kahin bhi hinsa ko phir se bhadakaane kii baat nahin thi, rajeev gandhi ne hinsa samaapt karne kaa puraa shrey khud yaa sarkaar ko na dekar unke saamne maujuud congress kaaryakartaaon sahit janata ko diya

 After 3 November 1984, assurances were given to protect the lives and property of the Sikh community across India, even if terrorism continued in the name of the Sikh community for the next decade
 rajeev gandhi ke pradhanmantritv kaa kaal khatm hone tak, punjab ke 47 fisadi thanon ko aatankwaadi vaardaat kii ek bhi jaankaree nahin mili thi
 Terrorism in Punjab was abolished by the mid-nineties, but the sad fact is that by then Rajiv Gandhi himself had become the victim of a human bomb

 hindi ke pathakon ke bich gyaan chaturvedi ne apni aupnyasik kritiyon se sirf vyangy kaa thaath hi khadaa nahin kiya, na hi kisi bhi keemat par pathak ko hansaakar apana banane kaa prayaas kiya, balki kisi bhi vishay va parivesh par unki paini drushti unke lekhan ko vishisht banaati rahi he
 In his fifth novel 'pagalkhana', he has created a huge fantasy about the market
 yahaan ve yah bhi maanate hai ki bazaar ke bina jivan sambhav nahin he
 But whatever the market, it is only an arrangement that we stand for our convenience, but if we start using the same market for our convenience and prosperity? This is happening today
 bazaar ab samaaj ke kinare basaa graahak kii raah dekhtaa ek suvidha-tantra-bhar nahin he
 He has begun to want what we need to decide
 iske liye usne hamaari bhashaa ko hamase behatar dhang se samaj liya he, hamaare instinctus ko padhaa he, samaaj ke rup main hamaari maanviya kamazoriyon, hamaare pyaar, ghrinaa, gusse, ghamand kii sanrachana ko jaan liya he
 Not only this, the market has closely understood our sexual frustrations, our rage of sadism, our mind unleashing murder, and hence it is no surprise that now it wants to rule over us

 a partbook excerpt from his satirical novel 'pagalkhana' on Gyan Chaturvedi's birthday: Pagalkhana was with Bhagwan Bazar because he was not mad
 a wall of the same clinic in the same clinic has a beautiful niche of God
 murti ke samaksh deepaknuma roshni ke balb jal rahe hai
 God is sitting here smiling needlessly
 ve sabakuch itani nirpekshata se taak rahe hai maano ki yah duniya unki banaai duniya hi na ho
 
 
 Or maybe it is a world gone out of their hands! There is a huge crowd at the clinic right now
 rahati hi he
 'what happened to Baba?' a middle-aged woman is sitting with a child
 usee ne, paas baithe buudhe ke saath vaali aurat se, maano yon hi, time kaatane ke liye puch liya
 The old man is rising
 vah apni baari kii pratiksha main sofe par oongh rahaa he athwa doctor dwaara di gai dawaaiyon ke prabhaav main uneenda he, bataanaa bada kathin he
 His wife sitting near him was looking at the tall husband with very anxious eyes when the woman with the child asked him what had happened to Baba? Here the child is sitting silently
 vah bich-bich, bina kisi kii bhi taraf dekhe muskuraane lagata he
 Even once she laughed out loud, the woman who came along asked her to keep quiet
 bachche kii muskaan or hansee bachche jaisi nahin he, or daraanevaali baat yah he ki yah baat yahan kisi ko bhi daraa nahin rahi
 The time is such that even the children are going crazy and everyone considers this to be a normal phenomenon
 'kya ho gaya baba ko?’ usne phir poocha
 'do not know!
 
 
 bas, din-raat dare se rahete hai!’ budhiya ne chintit nigaah se buudhe kii taraf dekhte hue kaha
 'why? What are you afraid of? ”just be nervous
 sote hi nahin
 
 
 
 ek jagah bhi chaiyn se baithte nahin
 Restless roam throughout the house
 
 
 
 Zara-zara is shocked at the sound
 
 
 
 They are wary on the bed all night
 sote nahin
 
 
 
 hardam dare rahete hai
 'when someone is just asking sympathetically, the woman poured all her pain together
 'kehete kya hai?
 
 
 After all, what are you afraid of? " 
 
 bataate shame aati he
 
 
 
 ekadam bacchon jaisi baaten!’'phir bhi
 
 
 ? '' We say that we both have become old stuff now
 
 
 
 At home, we live like an old Atala
 
 
 
 Keep saying that don't let your children expel us on OLX
 
 
 
 There is no place on the Internet to sell old and homely items - OLX, right there! It is always said that if they get their right price from anywhere, then these children will surely sell us online
 ’'aise kaise?’'wo vigyaapan main dikhaate hai na ki bas, saamaan kii photo khinchakar oelex par daal do to koi na koi kareed hi letaa he
 
 
 
 puraane saamaan ke bhi khub graahak hai na aajkal
 "oh that's fine, but why do they feel like this?" Just one day, they were sitting in the verandah, just in a comfortable chair
 bete ne us din nayaa mobile karidaa tha
 He also showed this mobile to him
 usee se inaki tasviir bhi khinch lee
 Then began to show that look, Papa, what a fantastic photo you have! 
 
 bas, usee ke baad inkaa ye haal he
 It is said that we think foolish son that we will not understand the real thing
 'par main to turant samaj gaya
 He has taken such a great picture to sell me so that the customer likes the goods
 ’ us din se, bas, yahi rat laga rakhi he
 The son explained a lot
 auron ne bhi inase baat kii he
 Everyone has explained a lot
 par ye hai ki maanate hi nahin
 Now there is a slight noise somewhere outside the house, even a postman, instead of the doorbell, starts to run around by surprise that a customer has definitely come! 
 
 ’budhiya ruaansi ho gai sara kuch bataate-bataate
 The woman who came with the child listened intently to the entire Ramakatha
 bich-bich main vah us buudhe ko bhi dekhati rahi jo sofe par dubakaa hua-sa baitha he
 The old lady had become silent after saying the whole Ram Kahani
 aurat bhi sabakuch sunakar thodi der tak chup rahi
 Then the woman came near the old lady's ear and said in a very whisper, "do you know that Baba may be telling the truth?" The old lady looked at him with surprise
 'ji haan! ho saktaa he ki baba pagal na hon
 Suppose they are telling the truth? 
 
 maan lo ki sahi baat par hi dar rahe hon, to?’'kisi ajeeb baaten kar rahi hai aap?’'dekhie mataji, duniya main kabhi kahin koi bhi baat jab pehali baar hoti he to hamen shuru main vah ajeeb hi lagati he!’'matlab yah, ki aapkaa bhi maananaa he ki hamaara betaa ab hamen purana saamaan maanata he?’'kyon nahin maan saktaa? bataaie na? or vahi kyon, bahut se bachche aisa hi maanate hai
 
 
 
 haan, maan-baap ko kisi puraane saamaan kii tarah online nikaal dene kaa aapke bete kaa yah idia zarur ekadam nayaa he
 "he has no such idea, you understand?" The old lady started getting angry
 'naaraaz na hon
 God forbid it be so
 
 
 
 But, how do you know that he has no such idea? It may be that
 
 
 
 Why can't it be? 
 
 
 ho saktaa he ki baba to sabakuch samaj gaye hon or aap hi galatafahami main hon?’'kisi ghatiya or ulti-sidhi baaten kar rahi hai aap?’'isamen ulta-sidhaa jaisaa to kuch bhi nahin he antee
 And this is not even such a cheap thing
 zaraa sochie na! yah kyon nahin ho saktaa ki bazaar main buudhe maan-baap ko kareedne kii koi aakarshak skim haal hi main laanch ho gai ho?
 
 
 Nowadays anything can happen in the market
 rose hota rahata he
 Hey, why can't this happen when the garbage buying schemes are being launched? "are you crazy too?" See, don't be angry
 
 
 
 Understand the point
 
 
 
 i am not saying anything wrong
 maine to bas aapako yahi bataaya na ki ho saktaa he ki ankal pagal na hon
 
 
 
 ho saktaa he ki aapke bete ne aapako yahan bas isiilie bheja ho
 
 
 "why are you sent?" 
 
 ’ budhiya taish main aa gai
 'perhaps it is because of this that the uncle of the drug addicts should keep sleeping in the house, and as soon as they are asleep, they can be packed comfortably to catch any buyer
 jaagate aadmi ko bechnaa zaraa mushkil hoga na, tabhi
 
 
 
 pitaaji jaagate rahenge to ve faaltu kaa hallaa bhi kar sakate hai na?
 
 
 Customer will flare up
 
 
 
 The market believes that whatever happens, the customer should not flare up
 graahak sabase upar he
 
 
 "you don't know what are you saying?" 
 
 
 "I just told you one thing
" 
 
 
 Aunt has changed the world
 
 
 
 Be careful inkaa bhi thik se khyaal rakhie
 
 
 
 ye jo bhi kah rahe hai, use bhi thik se suniye or inke kahe ko samajhie bhi
 
 
 
 ho saktaa he ki ankal hi sahi kah rahe hon?’budhiya ghabaraakar us aurat se tanik dur khisak gai
 He stared at the woman sitting together
 yah aurat abhi kisi paaglon jaisi baaten kar rahi thi!
 
 
 Is it not brought here itself for treatment? It is sometimes difficult to distinguish a lunatic as to whether the person who is meeting you right now is a lunatic or a lunatic, or a worker of a madhouse? Here the child sitting with the woman is staring at the old lady
 baccha budhiya ko dekhakar aise khulkar muskuraayaa maano uske man kii baat jaan gaya ho! phir vah baccha hansane laga
 The woman put her hand on the child's back and explained, 'son, don't laugh like that
 
 
 
 All are disturbed
 
 
 
 'but the child kept on laughing
 udhar boodha ekadam chupchaap baitha he
 The child is laughed at the old lady
 budhiya asahaj hokar aale main dhari bhagwaan kii murti ko taakane lagi
 God is smiling needlessly
 
 
 
 Perhaps this was the time when even God was with the market
 
 
 
 As if it had its goodness also

 is tarah ek aloyu se karj lene or phir is karj ko chukaane ke liye nae aloyu hasil karne kaa puraa gorakhdhandha chalata rahaa
 That is, the seeds of this scam were sown seven years ago in 2011 itself

 The last such LOU was released on 2 May last year

 The CBI has so far questioned 13 PNB officers

 Nobody can really understand the ups and downs of life till yesterday where love was knocking in ishita-raman's life

 Raman somehow managed Ishita and prevented her from leaving the house
 ab vah ishita kii madad se khaanaa pakaana sikh rahe hai kyonki pihu ke skool main ek kooking compitishan hone vaala he jise raman ne bhi hissaa liya he
 Now it is to be seen how well he is able to fulfill this responsibility of husband and father

 patel kaa kahana he ki itane logon ke saamne wo kaise kisi par haath uthaa sakate the

 madhyapradesh kii jabalpur loksabhaa seat rajya kii sabase mahatvapurn siton main shaamil he
 The reason behind this is that Jabalpur is the center of politics in the Mahakaushal region of southeast Madhya Pradesh
 yah seat bijepi kaa garh he jahaan use 23 saal se koi nahin diga paaya
 Here BJP has been winning continuously since 1996
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh rakesh singh san 2004 se yahaan ke saansad hai

 While there has been a trend of change in Jabalpur Lok Sabha area before, this trend has changed since 1996
 pichley 23 saal se yahaan ke matadaata nirantar bijepi ko jeet kaa sehara pahanaate aa rahe hai
 After independence from 1951 to 1974, Congress won the seat on this seat
 iske baad yahaan ke matadaata nirantar badlaav karte rahe
 But since 1996, Jabalpur voters did not like the change
 aagaamee chunaav main bijepi ke liye yah seat kahin zyada ahm he kyonki yahaan se uske pradesh adhyaksh rakesh singh kaa chunaav ladanaa tay he
 Since the state is the seat of the president, winning here is a question of the nose of the BJP
 iske alaava uske liye apane 23 saal puraane garh ko bachaane kii bhi chunauti he
 The challenge is for the Congress to regain its old stronghold

 is seat par baad main hue upachunaav main seth govind das chune gaye
 In 1957, Jabalpur and Mandla became two separate parliamentary constituencies
 is saal duusari loksabhaa ke liye hue chunaav main congress ke seth govind das jite
 After this, the winning process of Seth Govind Das continued
 unhone 1962, 1967 or 1971 ke chunaav bhi jite
 The year 1974 was a year of change for the Jabalpur seat
 jabalpur main chaatr raajnneeti main sakriy rahe sharad yadav is saal mukhya dhara kii raajnneeti main kud pade
 He was associated with Jayaprakash Narayan's Vidyarthi Andolan and during student politics he also formed his support base in the Jabalpur region
 us daur main congress ke khilaaf ek lahar bhi ban gai thi
 Seth Govind Das was an industrialist while Sharad Yadav was the face among the general public
 haalanki is baar seth govind das chunaav maidan main nahin the
 Sharad Yadav, who contested on the Bharatiya Lok Dal ticket, defeated Jagdish Narayan Awasthi of the Congress
 unhone congress kaa garh dhaha daalaa
 After the Emergency, Sharad Yadav again won the elections held in 1977

 uttar pradesh kii sthiti to is maamle main or bhi kharaab he
 Such complaints are commonly found that teachers are absent from schools
 lekin aise halaat main bhi ummid kii kiran jagaane vaale kuch shikshak hai, jin par garv kiya ja saktaa he
 Such is the story of two teachers of UP, who were transferred and the school children started crying bitterly
 shikshakon ke jane kaa samay aayaa to chaatr to chaatr, gaanv kaa har shaks dukhi dikhaai diya
 The entire village came to the road and bid farewell to these teachers with the songs of the women singing
 'master sahab, hamen rota chhodkar mat jaao'pehali kahani he shikshak avanish yadav kii
 He was still posted as Principal at Pipradhanni, Primary School, Gauribazar Block, Deoria
 mul rup se gajipur ke babhanavali gaanv ke rahane vaale avanish kii 2009 main is vidhyalay ke liye tainaati hui, to gaanv main shiksha ke halaat bahut hi badahaal the
 The people of the village did not send children to school
 avanish ne harijan basti or majdoor varg main ja-jaakar logon ko bacchon ko skool bhejne ke liye manaaya
 Not only was the principal created in 2013, he also asked the parents to point out the defects of the school
 avanish ne ji-jaan lagaakar bacchon ko padhaayaa
 When needed, she also gave them herself by purchasing a copy-pencil
 apane kaam kii vajah se hi avanish ko 2013 main isi vidhyalay main tarakkee dekar pradhanadhyaapak bana diya gaya
 Avnish's hard work not only changed the situation of education, but she also contributed to the problems of the village
 haal main avanish kaa tabadalaa unke grih janapad gajipur ke liye hua to wo skool se vidaai lene ke liye pahunche to puraa gaanv gamgin tha
 On seeing the children crying bitterly, Avneesh's eyes also flowed out of tears
 kya bachche, kya mahilaayein, gaanv kaa har shaks yahi kahata najar aayaa 'masterji hamen rota chhodkar mat jaao
 "bring our Sirji back, he misses you very much" Munish Kumar's story is similar to Avnish
 munish rampur jile ke shahbaad ilaake ke rampura gaanv main ab tak praathmik vidhyalay main pradhanadhyaapak ke pad par tainaat the
 Prior to this, he has been in the post of assistant teacher in Parota Primary School in the same area
 mainpuri ke mul nivasee munish kumaar ne itani mehnat kii ki unhone gaanv main shiksha kii tasviir hi badal di
 Farewell with Band Baja Seeing his hard work, he was made the headmaster of Rampura Primary School
 munish kaa haal main unke mul jile main tabadalaa hua to wo relive hone ke baad skool pahunche
 School children, teachers and everyone in the village felt as if someone from their home was moving away from them
 phir bhi gaanv waalon ne puure gaaje baaje ke saath munish ko vidaa kiya
 When the Aaj Tak team interacted with the children of Rampura Primary School, they started crying again after remembering their Munish sir
 saath hi kehane lage, 'hamaare sar ko waapas le aaen, unki bahut yaad aati he, unase acha na koi tha or na koi aayega
 'teachers who shy away from teaching in schools, should learn from Avnish and Munish
 yahi he wo jajba jo desh ke dehaton main shiksha kii tasviir badal saktaa he

 After losing the ODI and T-20 series, Team India made a tremendous comeback in Mohali and beat the number one Test team in 3 days
 bengaluru test ke mehmaan team kii pareshaaniyaan or badhati nazar aa rahi hai
 While Vernon Philander is unfit to leave the series, Dale Steyn has crashed out of the second Test, but Indian captain Virat Kohli is not ready to make any concessions

 Speaking to Bollywood Life, producer Asit Modi of "taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashma" said - We have not finalized anyone yet for the role of Dayaben

 bharat vishwa cap group bi main bhale hi sheersh par kabiz ho lekin uski quarter final kii seat puri tarah se pakki nahin hui he or ab bhi mahendra singh dhoni kii team agar magar ke janjaal main funs sakati he
 Although this situation is hypothetical, it cannot be said that the Indian team has reached the quarter-finals
 bharat ke paanch match main saat ank hai or use ab 20 march ko apane antim lig match main westeindies se khelnaa he
 If the Indian team wins in that match then it will go straight to the quarter-finals but it can also make it to the knockout stage before that even though it will depend on the result of other teams
 group bi main abhi sabase najuk sthiti england kii bani hui he or use antim aath main jagah banane ke liye apane agle match main westeindies par har haal main jeet darj kerani hogi
 If Andrew Strauss's team fails, then India will reach the quarter-finals before their next match
 yadi england kii team westeindies ko bade antar se haraa detii he to uske bhi saat ank ho jaaenge
 Conversely, if the Caribbean team overshadows India and Bangladesh wins both their matches in the meantime, and South Africa's team defeats Ireland and then defeats Bangladesh, then the Indian team's problems may increase
 aisi dasha main westeindies, dakshin africa or bangladesh kii timen aath-aath ank lekar agle daur main pahonchegi jabaki bharat or england ke saat-saat ank honge or unamem se quarter final main pahunchane vaali team kaa faisla net ran rate se hoga
 Group a does not see such a situation
 is group se newjiland kii team aaj canada par jeet se quarter final main pahunch gayi he
 He now has eight points from five matches
 srilanka paanch match main saat ank lekar pehle hi antim aath main jagah bana chukaa he kyonki is group se canada or kenya nakout kii daud se baahar ho gayi hai or yadi zimbabwe agle donon match jeet jaataa he to tab bhi uske chah ank hi honge
 Pakistan have six points from four matches and will go on to secure a place in the next leg by registering a win over Zimbabwe tomorrow
 australia bhi kenya par jeet darj karke hi duusare daur main jagah bana legaa
 This means that the top four teams from Group a will reach the quarter-finals but England or India, especially England, in Group b are in danger of being eliminated in the first round

 dilli main sisitivi camere lagavane or rakrakhaav ko lekar hoicourt ne dilli police or dilli sarkaar ko nae aadesh jari kiye hai
 The Delhi government told the High Court that CCTV cameras have been installed at 4388 sensitive places across the city but out of that only 2919 CCTV cameras are working while the rest of the faulty cameras are still under repair
 mukhya nyaayadhish dien patel or nyaayamurti si
 Harishankar's bench asked the Delhi Police's counsel to either complete the repair of the defective cameras or replace it soon
 court ne kaha ki sarkaar kharaab camaron kii marammat kara rahi he or ab is par sunwaayee kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Click here to pay tribute to Sushma Swaraj: The Delhi government had told the court on 15 February during the hearing of a public interest litigation related to women safety that all police stations and police posts would be fitted with CCTV cameras within a month
 vahiin rajdhani dilli ke sabhi samvedansheel ilkon main saal ke bheetar camere laga die jaaenge
 It was also told by the government that all the cameras would be state-of-the-art which would work under any circumstances
 haalanki court ne pehle hi dilli sarkaar ko camere kii gunvattta kaa khyal rakhane kii baat kahi thi
 The court directed the Delhi Police Commissioner as well as the concerned police officers to ensure that the cameras are installed in all the police stations and outposts
 camere kaam karte rahen ise lekar bhi niyamit nigaraanee karte rahen
 The court also said that monitoring work should be given to any independent body like agency like CISF
 bataa den court ne dilli sarkaar ke mukhya sachiv ko pehle nirdesh die the ki ve apni adhyakshata main sambandhit nikaayon or agenciyon ke saath baithak karen or sabhi jagahon par street lite lagavaaya janaa sunishchit karane

 vahiin sarkaar ne kaha tha ki dilli kii samvedansheel jagahon par 1
 4 million CCTV cameras will be installed by the end of the year
 saath hi sabhi camere kendrikrut centre se jude honge
 Therefore, if the court wants, then everyone can be investigated by making the lawyer a court commissioner
 isi se court ko pataa chalaa ki 4388 sisitivi camaron main se philhal 2919 camere hi kaam kar rahe hai

 1 (vibe UI) History is set to be made in Wimbledon on Sunday
 dekhne kii baat yah hogi ki itihaas banaata koun he
 The final of Wimbledon will be a clash between Roger Federer and Andy Murray
 is mukaable main jeet chaahe jisaki ho, itihaas banegaa
 If Roger Federer wins, it will be his seventh Grand Slam title at the Wimbledon ground
 peet sampraas ke world record kii barabari vah kar lenge or unke grand slam kitaabon kii sankhya 17 ho jaaegi
 He is already at the forefront
 vahiin duusari ore, endi mare hai jo 74 saal ke lambey intjaar ke baad wimbledon final main pahunchane kaa karnama dikhaane vaale british khilaadi hai
 But the important question is whether Murray will be able to make history
 
 
 
 In a sense, this match is also an example of the commitment of these two tennis players
 roger federr tennis kii duniya ke sarvakalik mahaan khilaadiyon main gine jate hai
 He has 16 Grand Slam titles to his name but has not won any Grand Slam titles during the last two and a half years
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki federr kaa khel kharaab hone laga tha
 The 30-year-old Federer was facing a tough challenge from Rafal Nadal and Novak Djokovic
 federr apana sarvshereshth khel dikhaane ke baavjood in donon kii teji or court kawarej ke saamne pichhadane lage the
 But Federer is not one to give up easily
 yah baat ek baar phir se unhone sabit kar di
 Djokovic's mother made a statement in 2008 when Novak Djokovic defeated him in the Australian Open final
 
 
 'da king iz ded
 
 
 '
 unka akalan galat sabit hua or federr uske baad bhi grand slam jeetne main kaamyaab rahe
 This time, Djokovic has also said that Federer is fit to become number one again after the defeat at the hands of Federer in the semi-finals
 wimbledon jeetne ke baad federr phir se number van ban jaaenge
 If this happens, Pete Sampras will also match the world record of becoming number one for 286 weeks
 duusari ore, endi mare hai
 Murray's misfortune is that he is playing tennis at a time when Federer Nadal and Djokovic are not ready to leave room for a fourth
 isliye vah sarvshereshth chaar khilaadiyon main chauthe number par hi bane hue hai
 He can make history at Wimbledon but for that he will have to give himself up
 landan main sthaneey darshak bhi mare kaa joardaar samarthan karenge lekin federr se paar paanaa unke liye itnaa aasaan bhi nahin hoga
 Although he has defeated Federer several times, but he has not been able to present any challenge to him in the final of the Grand Slam
 2008 ke yues open or 2010 ke australian open ke final main federr ne mare ko sidhe seton main haraaya he
 The comments kaha jaataa he ki har daur apane aap main pratisparddhi or romaanchakta kaa put liye hota he
 In every round, the race between the two legends is worth seeing, but for tennis fans, this is the best round of tennis
 is daur ke darshakon ko ek saath roger federr, novak jokovich, rafoyal nadal or endi mare jaise damdaar khilaadiyon ko dekhne ko mauka mil rahaa he
 Never before has there been such a great round of tennis at the same level
 vaise bhi jeniyas roj roj paidaa nahin hote
 Tennis will have to wait a long time, at least for a genius like Roger Federer
 yah jarur he ki aane vaale dinon main tennis kaa str or badhegaa
 The capacity of the coming youth will also increase
 lekin tennis main federr to ek hi hoga
 Whichever one wins in this match, history will be made
 agar roger federr jite to yah wimbledon ke maidan par unka saatvaan grand slam khitaab hoga
 He will be able to match Pete Sampras' world record and his Grand Slam title will be 17
 pehle se hi vah sabase aage chal rahe hai
 On the other hand, there is Andy Murray, the British player who has reached the Wimbledon final after a 74-year long wait
 lekin ahm sawaal yah he ki kya mare itihaas bana paaenge
 
 
 
 ek myne main yah muqabla tennis ke in do diggaj khilaadiyon kii patibaddhta kii misaal bhi he
 Roger Federer is counted among the all-time greatest players in the tennis world
 unke naam 16 grand slam khitaab hai lekin beete dhai saal ke dauraan vah koi bhi grand slam khitaab nahin jeet paae hai
 This does not mean that Federer's game was beginning to deteriorate
 30 saal ke federr ko rafaal nadal or novak jokovich se kadi chunauti kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa tha
 Federer, despite showing his best game, was lagging behind the duo's speed and court coverage
 lekin federr aasaani se haar maanane waalon main nahin hai
 He once again proved this
 2008 main jab novak jokovich ne australian open ke final main unhen haraaya tab jokovich kii maa ne ek bayaan diya tha
 
 
 'the King is Dead
 
 
 '
 His assessment proved to be wrong and Federer still managed to win the Grand Slam after that
 is baar to semifinal main federr ke haathon mili haar ke baad jokovich ne bhi kaha he ki federr phir se number van banane ke upyukt hai
 Federer would again become number one after winning Wimbledon
 aisa hua to peet sampraas ke 286 saptaah tak number van banane ke world record kii barabari bhi federr kar lenge
 On the other hand, there is Andy Murray
 mare kii badakismati yah he ki vah us daur main tennis khel rahe hai jab federr nadal or jokovich kisi chauthe ke liye jagah chhodane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 Therefore, he remains at number four among the best four players
 vah wimbledon main itihaas bana sakate hai lekin iske liye unhen khud ko jhonk dena hoga
 Local audiences in London will also strongly support Murray, but it will not be easy for him to overcome Federer
 vaise to federr ko vah kai baar haraa chuke hai lekin grand slam ke final main vah unke saamne koi chunauti pesh nahin kar paae hai
 Federer defeated Murray in straight sets in the finals of the 2008 US Open and 2010 Australian Open
 tippaniyan It is said that each round is itself a competition and thrill
 har daur main do lijends ke bich badshahath kii hode dekhne laayak hoti he lekin tennis ke prashansakon ke liye yah tennis kaa sabase behtareen daur he
 The audience of this round is getting a chance to see such strong players as Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray
 ek samaan str par itani behtareen tennis kaa daur isse pehle kabhi nahin dikhaa
 Anyway, geniuses are not born every day
 kam se kam roger federr jaise jeniyas ke liye tennis ko lanbaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 It is definitely that the level of tennis will increase in the coming days
 aane vaale yuvaaon kii kshamta bhi badhegi
 But in tennis, Federer will be one
 vahiin duusari ore, endi mare hai jo 74 saal ke lambey intjaar ke baad wimbledon final main pahunchane kaa karnama dikhaane vaale british khilaadi hai
 But the important question is whether Murray will be able to make history
 
 
 
 In a sense, this match is also an example of the commitment of these two tennis players
 roger federr tennis kii duniya ke sarvakalik mahaan khilaadiyon main gine jate hai
 He has 16 Grand Slam titles to his name but has not won any Grand Slam titles during the last two and a half years
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki federr kaa khel kharaab hone laga tha
 The 30-year-old Federer was facing a tough challenge from Rafal Nadal and Novak Djokovic
 federr apana sarvshereshth khel dikhaane ke baavjood in donon kii teji or court kawarej ke saamne pichhadane lage the
 But Federer is not one to give up easily
 yah baat ek baar phir se unhone sabit kar di
 Djokovic's mother made a statement in 2008 when Novak Djokovic defeated him in the Australian Open final
 
 
 'da king iz ded
 
 
 '
 unka akalan galat sabit hua or federr uske baad bhi grand slam jeetne main kaamyaab rahe
 This time, Djokovic has also said that Federer is fit to become number one again after the defeat at the hands of Federer in the semi-finals
 wimbledon jeetne ke baad federr phir se number van ban jaaenge
 If this happens, Pete Sampras will also match the world record of becoming number one for 286 weeks
 duusari ore, endi mare hai
 Murray's misfortune is that he is playing tennis at a time when Federer Nadal and Djokovic are not ready to leave room for a fourth
 isliye vah sarvshereshth chaar khilaadiyon main chauthe number par hi bane hue hai
 He can make history at Wimbledon but for that he will have to give himself up
 landan main sthaneey darshak bhi mare kaa joardaar samarthan karenge lekin federr se paar paanaa unke liye itnaa aasaan bhi nahin hoga
 Although he has defeated Federer several times, but he has not been able to present any challenge to him in the final of the Grand Slam
 2008 ke yues open or 2010 ke australian open ke final main federr ne mare ko sidhe seton main haraaya he
 The comments kaha jaataa he ki har daur apane aap main pratisparddhi or romaanchakta kaa put liye hota he
 In every round, the race between the two legends is worth seeing, but for tennis fans, this is the best round of tennis
 is daur ke darshakon ko ek saath roger federr, novak jokovich, rafoyal nadal or endi mare jaise damdaar khilaadiyon ko dekhne ko mauka mil rahaa he
 Never before has there been such a great round of tennis at the same level
 vaise bhi jeniyas roj roj paidaa nahin hote
 Tennis will have to wait a long time, at least for a genius like Roger Federer
 yah jarur he ki aane vaale dinon main tennis kaa str or badhegaa
 The capacity of the coming youth will also increase
 lekin tennis main federr to ek hi hoga

" ’’ khaware ne apane patr main likhaa he ki shikshakon dwaara avaidh tution ke kaarobaar se shiksha pranali main dikhaaya gaya abhibhavakon kaa vishwaas tuutata he
 Therefore action is needed

 The Bharatiya Janata Party says that the issues of development will be the most important in the elections of five states and the party will fight the elections by taking this
 party ko lagata he ki chunaav main vikaas ke mudde ko lekar chalane se zyada phayda hoga
 This will be followed by demonetisation and surgical strike issues
 bijepi ke kuch netaaon se baatcheet main ye baat saaf hui ki chunaav vikaas ke mudde par hi ladaa jayega haalanki netaaon ne notebandi ko kaledhan or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sarkaar kaa ek aitihaasik kadam bataaya he
 Union minister and senior BJP leader Kalraj Mishra says that in the elections of five states, we will carry forward the issue of development
 vahi hamaara bada mudda hoga
 The closure of the note is an important step taken by the government against corruption
 vahiin kendriya mantri sadhvi niranjan jyoti ne kaha ki notebandi mudda nahin he, vikaas hi mudda hoga
 Party spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain also says that we will move ahead in the elections on the issue of development itself
 unhone kaha ki notebandi mudda nahin he agar vipaksh ise mudda banayega tab yah jarur mudda ban jayega
 BJP MP and Uttarakhand leader Satpal Maharaj also says that development will be our primary issue and we will highlight the failures of the Congress in Uttarakhand
 saath-saathuttarakhand ke vikasko ham log aage lekar chalenge
 Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that development will be our issue and only on that we will win elections in five states
 baar-baar notebandi ke bare main poochne par tomars ne kaha ki notebandi bhi mudda ho saktaa he lekin vikaas hi mudda hoga
 After talking to the leaders of the party, one thing is clear that the party has chosen the development issue for the five states in view of the problems faced by the people regarding the decision of the note ban
 kyonki 2014 ke chunaav main bhi vikaas ke mudde par hi narendra modi kii sarkaar bani thi
 After that, BJP in Maharashtra, Haryana, Assam also contested and won in the name of development
 haalanki party adhyaksh amit shah ne apane rashtriya kaaryakarini main die bhaashan main notebandi or sargical strike kaa bhi zikr kiya aurasarkaaraki in kadamon ko lekar kii saraahna kii gai he
 So it is clear that along with development in the election, surgical strikes and demonetisation will also become an issue, but the issue of development will remain ahead

 After the general elections, their aim will be to make the country a non-bjp and non-congress government
 prakaash karaat ne tisare morche kii sambhaavnaaon par kaha ki 2014 ke chunaavon ke baad sarkaar banane main kshetreey dalon kii badi bhoomika rahane vaali he

 At the same time, England lost two places, the team is ranked fourth behind South Africa by 109 ratings points
 agar bhartiya team donon match jeet leti he to vah ek reating ank hasil kar 118 se australia se ek ank aage rahegi tathaa sheersh par pahunch jaaegi
 But if she loses one of the two matches, India will be one place behind Australia by 116 points, losing a rating
 donon maichon main haar kaa matlab he ki bharat do reating ank ganvaa degaa or 115 ank se australia se do reating ank peeche duusare sthaan par rahegaa

 ek taraf jahaan maa bachche ko berahami se peet rahi hai, vahiin duusari taraf mahila kii body language bataati he ki ye sab karne vaali mahila ko is baat kaa ilm bhi nahin he ki wo apane hi bachche ko peet rahi he lihaaja mahila ko bhi turant medical treetment kii zarurat he
 The child's grandmother complained that an FIR has been lodged against the woman
 darasal, dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ke paas somvaar shaam ko shikaayat mili thi ki ek mahila apane bachche kii pitayee karti he
 The grandmother of the complaining child had submitted a CCTV footage to the Commission with the complaint in which the child's mother was beating her badly
 shikaayat par ection lete hue dilli mahila ayog kii adhyaksh swati maliwal ne gita colony ke esechao ko patr likhakar is maamle main turant karrwai karne kii sifarish kii thi, jis par ection lete hue police ne mangalvaar ko aaropee maa par exiaar darj kar lee
 While the child was presented to the Child Welfare Committee, the Welfare Committee gave the child's custody to his aunt
 swati maliwal ke mutabik ye video kaaphi chaunkaane vaala he kyonki koi maa apane kaleje ke tukade ko berahami se pite ye kalpana karnaa bhi mushkil he
 But given the footage seen in the video, it is necessary to keep the mother away from the children for some time so that the mental state of the woman who was assaulting the child is investigated after investigating the case

 bijepi ke varisht netaa murali manohar joshi ne mahatvakankshi project ‘namaami gange’ par apni sarkaar se alag ruukh akhriyaar karte hue shuukravaar ko kaha ki ganga nadi kii safai ke liye jis tarah se pariyojna chalaai ja rahi he, usase agle 50 saal main bhi nadi saaf nahin ho sakegi
 Expressing his objections to the necessary clean Ganga project, Joshi said that as long as there is no uninterrupted water flow in the river, cleaning the Ganges will be a distant dream
 unhone ne kaha, ‘jab tak nadi main nirbaadh jal pravaah nahin hota, ganga kii safai dur kaa sapana hoga
 Just as the river is being cleaned by dividing it into small reservoirs, turning it into small reservoirs, the river cannot be cleaned even in the next 50 years
 ’ unhone kaha ki ganga hamaari jeevanarekha he organgako koi khatra hamaari samskruti or parampara ke liye khatra hoga
 Questioning Gadkari's project, Markshoshi advocated uninterrupted water flow in the Ganga and questioned Union Minister Nitin Gadkari's inland waterway project, which talks about moving large vessels in the Ganges river to carry heavy products
 unhone kaha, ‘ganga main jahaaj chalaanaa to dur, badi naav bhi nahin chal paaengi, is yojana ko lagu karne se pehle ganga kii maujuuda sthiti kii jaanch kara len
 The example given by Madan Mohan Malaviya: Murali Manohar Joshi advised the Ministry of Shipping to first look at the current state of the river and its geographical area, then decide on the project's implementation
 ’ unhone kaha ki pandit madan mohan malviya ne nadi main jal pravaah ko kaayam rakhane ke liye angrejon se sangharsh kiya tha or yahaan tak ki haridwar main ganga nadi main satat pravaah kaa nunatam str kaayam rakhane ke liye ek samjhaute par hastakshar karne ke liye baadhya kar diya tha

 raajnneetik partiyaan chunaav prachaar ke jariye votaron main lubhaane main juty hai
 There are few leaders in the state whose entire politics is centered on his name
 inamen sabase ahm naam he rajya ke pehle mukhyamantriajit jogika
 Ever since the state was formed, the politics of the state has been revolving around Jogi
 ab jabacongressraman singh ko satta se hataane main juty he to ajit jogi ne basapa supremeo mayawati ke saath gathbandhan kar chunaav main nayaa mode laa diya he
 Ajit Jogi started his career as a collector, during which he came in contact with the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was doing a collection in Indore
 1986 ke aasapaas unhone congress jwine kar lee or sakriy raajnneeti main pravesh kiya
 After this, Jogi's political coin began to shine, he was a member of Rajya Sabha from 1986 to 1998
 is dauraan vah congress main alag-alag pad par kaarykar rahe, vahiin 1998 main raigarh se loksabhaa saansad chune gaye
 When the state of Chhattisgarh was formed in the year 2000, the Congress had a majority in that area
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki congress ne bina kuch deree ke ajit jogi ko hi rajya kaa mukhyamantri bana diya
 Jogi remained the CM of the state till 2003
 haalanki, uske baad jogi kii tabiyat kharaab hoti rahi or unka raajnneetik graph bhi girtaa gaya
 He continued to rebel in the party and in the end he chose his own path
 ajit jogi ne 2016 main congress se baghawat kar apni alag party janata congress chhattisgarh ke naam se gathan kiya tha
 Whereas at one time he used to be the face of Congress in the state
 ab wo congress se do-do haath karne ke liye unhone basapa ke saath gathbandhan kiya he

 2013 main vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 8 disambar ko ghoshit kiye gaye the
 Among them, the Bharatiya Janata Party formed the government by defeating the Congress for the third consecutive time in the state
 raman singh kii aguwai main bijepi ko 2013 main kul 49 vidhansabha siton par jeet mili thi
 While the Congress was able to win only 39 seats
 jabaki 2 siten anya ke naam gai thim
 Despite the BJP getting three seats less than in 2008, they formed their government with an absolute majority

 Saint Valentine got many soldiers and officers married
 apane aadesh kaa virodh dekh aakhir clodias ne 14 farvari san 269 ko sant velentine ko faansee par chadhva diya
 Since then, this day has been celebrated in his memory
