 har baar modi sarkaar ke bichhaae jaal main kyon funs jaati he congressrahul gandhi or priyanka gandhi kii khamoshi par bhi uth rahe sawalkshmir se achaanak anuchhed 370 ko hataane kaa faisla lekar modi sarkaar ne congress kii mushkil badha di he
 The Congress may have opposed this move of the Modi government in Parliament, but there is confusion about this within the party
 rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne is mudde par sarkaar ko jamkar gheraa
 Earlier, in the presence of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, the Congress and a few opposition leaders met in the Parliament House complex
 isamen faisla hua ki party iskaa virodh karegi
 The arguments that were set, Azad said all these while speaking in Rajya Sabha
 darasal, congress ke bade netaa is line par dikh rahe hon lekin party kii duusari pankti ke tamaam netaa or kaaryakarta party ke is rukh se pareshaan hai
 Making this the issue, Congress Chief Whip Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned from Rajya Sabha
 vahiin, wiesar congress, bijedy, eidiemke ke saath hi vipakshi dalon main bispi or aap ne is masale par sarkaar kaa saath dekar congress ke maathe par bal badha die
 Many leaders of the Congress Working Committee, who are not currently mps or are in the states, directly say, "whatever stand the party leaders are taking in Parliament, it seems that the ground is far from reality
 ham jameen par siyasat karte hai
 In this way, the party is going to suffer a political loss due to the protest
 ”naam nahin bataane kii shart par is kheme ke netaaon ne kaha, “rajyasabha main baithe bade netaa alaakaman ko gumraah kar rahe hai, jo khud jamini hakeekat se dur hai
 "according to this camp, direct opposition should have been avoided on this issue
" kam se kam koi bich kaa rasta to nikaala hi ja saktaa tha
 Why is it that, on the lines of triple talaq, why does the Congress strategy fall into the trap of the Modi government every time? If sources are to be believed, the members of the Working Committee with such an opinion, who are not currently mps, will be held on August 10
 You can express your opinion in a working committee meeting
 is baithak main sonia gandhi, rahul or priyanka maujuud rahegein
 That is why no one is ready to speak officially yet
 kalita jaise vahi netaa bol rahe hai jo party chhodane kaa man bana chuke hai
 Questions are also being raised on why rahul-priyanka, who has an opinion on social media on all the issues, is still silent
 Is the Congress really stuck in Modi's stakes? However, the leaders advocating the party's stance on the issue say that we know it is a popular decision
 taatkaalik taur par virodh karne par hamako voton kaa nuksaan bhi hoga
 For this reason we cannot support the wrong move
 congress ke rajyasabha saansad anand sharma ne kaha, “itihaas main ham galat kaa samarthan karte nahin dikhnaa chaahate
 "overall, this stance of the Modi government is an attempt to push the Congress on the backfoot, but the Congress' stand is not good for the health of the party, apart from the inner tongue of the party

 Shiv Sena said, 'A lot was spoken about the Gujarat model of development, but now it is shaken
 ham kaamana karte hai ki 2019 ke chunaav tak yah dharashayi na ho jaae
 ' sanyukt raashtra sangh main maanavadhikaar parishad ke adhiveshan main atorni general dwaara bharat ko 'dharmanirpeksh' desh bataane ko lekar shivasena ne bijepi or pradhanmantri narendra modi par 100 karod hinduon ke saath dhokhaa karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Sivasane said that BJP has won all over the country and especially in the name of Hindutva in UP
 ab bijepi ne logon ke saath vishwasghaat kiya he
 The Shiv Sena, through Saamna, termed the term 'secular' as abusive to Hindus, which the secularists used as a weapon to defeat the Hindus
 sampadakeey menmodi sarkaarase sawaal kiya gaya he ki jab puri duniya main 56 islamic desh hai
 China, Japan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar are Buddhism countries and the whole of Europe including America, Russia is Christian, then how shameful to call India a Hindu nation? The Shiv Sena mouthpiece said that millions of Hindu volunteers have now started Sacrificed till desh kaa satyanaash 'secular' yani dharmanirpeksh shabd ne kiya he, jiskaa thikra ham hameshaa nehru ke maathe phodte rahe hai
 It is written in 'saamana', 'the truth is that this country is a Hindu nation
 desh kii aatma, sanskaar, samskruti sab hindutv kaa hi he
 After the creation of Pakistan in the name of religion in 1947, the remaining country should be considered as Hindustan i
e
 Hindu nation
 'shivasena ne kaha ki pakistan ke nirmaan ke baad bhi jo kareeb 2 karod musalmaan bache rah gaye
 We considered ourselves blessed to be called 'secular' for their happiness
 unke 2 karod aaj 22 karod ho gaye or yah 22 karod dharm ke naam par ham par baari pad rahe hai
 According to Shiv Sena, Hindu Rashtra does not mean that all people leave lungi and suit-boots and wear Pitambara, keep peon-janeu, but rather they worship this motherland, obey the civil law, and celebrate Vande Mataram
 'saamana' main likhaa gaya he ki agar yah desh dharmanirpeksh hi rahegaa to ram mandir kaa nirmaan dhong or govansh hatya par pabandi ek dikhaava or voton kii raajnneeti kehalaaegi
 Those who say 'proudly, we are Hindus' rule these days in the country, yet how did they suddenly become secular? a case should be registered against this government for cheating 100 crore Hindus

 IPC was not used there
 lekin dhara 370 ko hataae jane ke baad ab jammu kashmir main puure desh kii tarah bhartiya dand samhita yani ipisi lagu hogi
 Now it is necessary to understand here what was the Ranbir Penal Code? What was the Ranbir Penal Code? The Ranbir Penal Code was in force in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in India
 jise ranbir aachaar samhita bhi kaha jaataa tha
 According to Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, the Indian Penal Code could not be used in the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 yahaan keval ranbir dand samhita kaa prayog hota tha
 The Ranbir Penal Code was in force in this state since British times
 darasal, bharat ke aaazaad hone se pehle jammu kashmir ek swatantra riyasat thi
 At that time, the Dogra dynasty ruled Jammu and Kashmir

 yah samhita thomas babinton maikole kii bhartiya dand samhita ke hi samaan thi
 But some of its streams differed
 ranbir dand samhita main nahin the ye kanoonbhartiya dand samhita (ipisi) kii dhara 4 computer ke madhyam se kiye gaye aparaadhon kii vyakhya or unhen sambodhit karti he, lekin ranbir dand samhita main iskaa koi ullekh nahin he
 Under Section 153 CAA of the IPC, it is considered a punishable offense to deliberately bring weapons during public meetings or gatherings, while this important subject is not mentioned in the Ranbir Penal Code
 ipisi kii dhara 195A ke tahat agar koi kisi ko juthi gavaahi yaa bayaan dene ke liye pratadit karata he, to vah sajaa kaa hakdaar mana jaataa he, jabaki ranbir dand samhita main is sambandh main koi nirdesh nahin he
 Under Section 281 of the IPC, a person who is misleading a sailor with lights, marks or wheels used in perak is entitled to punishment, whereas there is nothing like that in the Ranbir Penal Code
 bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 304B, dahej ke kaaran hone vaali mauton se sambandhit he, lekin ranbir dand samhita main iskaa koi ullekh nahin he
 Under Section 190 of the Ranbir Penal Code, the government can punish any person who publishes or distributes invalid or seized material by the government
 is maamle main aparaadh kaa nirdhaaran karne kaa adhikaar mukhyamantri ko he
 This particular section badly affects journalism, freedom of thought, thought and expression
 ipisi main nahin hai ye kanuunaranbir dand samhita kii dhara 167A ke mutabiq jo bhi sarkari karmchaaree naakarda kaam ke liye kisi thekedaar kaa bhugtan sweekaar karte hai, vah kanoonee taur par sazaa ke haqadaar hai
 This important section related to bribery is not present in the IPC
 ranbir dand samhita kii dhara 420A ke tahat sarkaar, sakasham adhikari yaa praadhikaran kisi bhi samjhaute main hone vaale chal yaa dhokhadhadi kii sazaa kaa nirdhaaran karte hai
 Such a clear explanation is not in the IPC
 ranbir dand samhita kii dhara 204A saboot mitaane yaa bigaadane kii sazaa kaa saaf nirdhaaran karti he
 The IPC does not have such an explanation on this subject
 ranbir dand samhita kii dhara 21 saarvajanik naukari ke daayre kii vyakhya karti he jabaki bhartiya dand samhita main iskaa dayera simit he

 After the sp's displeasure over the statement of Union Minister Beni Prasad Verma, the Minister came to the media today and expressed regret for it
 unhone kaha ki agar kisi ko mere bayaan se ksht hua he to vah is par khed vyakt karte hai
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath was also present on the occasion
 isse pehle sapa kii naaraazgi ke baad piem karyaalay main sonia gandhi or kuch anya varisht netaaon kii maujuudagi main benny prasad verma ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 After this meeting, Beni Prasad Verma came before the media and regretted the statement
 isi ke saath verma aaj apane bayaan se mukar gaye ki unhone kabhi mulaayam singh par kamishan lene kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 At the same time, in response to the question of being satisfied on the regret of Beni Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav said that he will answer it after the meeting of the party's parliamentary party on Thursday
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki mauka aane par pratikriya duungaa
 The comments isse pehle aaj subah sansad main bhi donon sadanon main hangaamaa dekhne ko mila
 Samajwadi Party mps demanded the resignation of Union Minister and Congress MP Beni Prasad Verma
 hangaamen kii vajah se donon sadan dopaher tak ke liye sthagit kar die gaye
 Not only this, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav himself reminded Verma's statement
 unhone kaha ki congress party bataae kii samarthan ke liye vah kitna kamishan sapa ko de rahi he

 ) bharat ke raksha anusandhan or vikaas sanghathan (diardio) ke pramukh vijay saraswat ne 31 may ko sweden ke linkoping main ho rahe ek anaam se airospes seminar main bataur maanad atithi shirkat kii thi
 The missile scientist later flew in the Swedish fighter jet Saab Grippin and gave local journalists plenty of opportunity to capture interesting photographs
 lekin, ant main, jab apane pitare se ek dizin nikaal kar saraswat ne prastuti di to sab hatprabh rah gaye the, kyonki us din se pehle us cheez ko kisi ne dekha tak nahin tha-ve bharat kii ek sainya pariyojna ke dizin se judi aisi tasviren thim, jise aadhikarik taur par ab tak gopneey rakhaa gaya tha
 The DRDO or any other branch of the Ministry of Defense will rarely say anything in this regard
 ye tasviren bhartiya maanavrahit maarak vimaan (aayiuasavi) kii thim jiskaa code naam 'aura' he
 The 'aura' is an advanced type of intelligence bomber that more closely resembles the Cold War-time secretive aircraft than any attempt by India in this direction
 aise aircraft kaa vikaas or isse judi safalataa kii raah jitani mushkil rahi he, is aayiuasavi ko taiyaar karne ke peeche kaa mishan utana hi sidhaa-sada rahaa haih jameen par tainaat sainya-karmiyon dwaara remote-sanchalit udaan; dushmano ke hawaii kshetra main ghusane ke baad bhi pakad main na aana, yahaan tak ki dushmano ke radar par bhi yah najar nahin aata; maarak hathiyaaron ko tay nishaanon par tainaat kar waapas apane thikaane par pahunch janaa
 a government document states the Aura as an 'unmanned self-defense intensive survey aircraft', pointing out that since it can also defend itself from a missile hit, it was used for espionage can go
 diardio ne saat se aath saalon ke andar bhartiya vayusena ko is behad pechide or utane hi mahatvakankshi stealth bombar ko saunpane kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 This confidential Aura program currently costs Rs 100 crore
 ke shuruaati bajet ke saath dizin or pariklpana ke charan par kaam shuru kar diya gaya he
 a top official associated with the program said that the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) —a group of agencies that includes DRDO Lab and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd — expects to get a lot of this complex project within a budget of about a billion dollars
 The greater part will be completed
 dekha jaae to aayiuasavi ko upyogi banane kii vishisht technology se sambandhit kshetra main bharat ko koi khaas visheshgyata hasil nahin, yaa he bhi to naam bhar ko he, aise main diardio ke paas airospes kii sabase mushkil or saahas bhari chunauti khadi he
 This includes flying wing aerodynamics, radar absorbent paint and structural materials, state-of-the-art weaponry for remote targets and, most importantly, complex and impenetrable communications and data-link structures, which are needed to control such aircraft
 Which carries hundreds of miles of destructive missiles
 swadeshi aircraft ke sambandh main bhartiya airospes pratishthan ke haal ke pradarshnon ko agar koi sanket maane to aayiuasavi ko ek dussahsee sapana kaha ja saktaa he
 In the face of such a claim, the DRDO argues in its defense that unmanned combat drones are based on an authorized confidential technology that no country will ever share with India
 beshak is baat main dam he, lekin yah bhi dikh rahaa he ki aura kaarykram main apni-apni praudyogiki ko shaamil karne ke liye france, sweden or england ne apni dilchaspee jatalate hue diardio ke saath charchaa shuru kar di he
 But the truth is that the Indian Air Force (which will be the chief operator of IUSAV) has definitely expressed that foreign cooperation will be kept aside as far as possible on the platform on which it will work and especially on sensitive design issues and With regard to the sub-systems it has decided that no foreign help is to be sought
 is kade rukh ke peeche sena kii apni ashanka kaaphi sahi he ki videshi sarkaar yaa thekwdaar kisi matbhed yaa yuddh kii sthiti main kharid ke baad jaruri madad par roak laga sakate hai
 In March, Defense Minister A
 ke
 Antony informed Parliament that India's hard-hitting unfinished Kaveri jet engine could be fitted in the IUSAV
 iity, kanpur samet kai shaikshanik sansthaanon ko aayiuasavi se sambandhit jaruri ghatakon par ahm shodh karne ke liye saath main shaamil kiya gaya he
 DRDO is working on completely new areas
 agar sab kuch soch ke anuroop hua to bangaloru main pramukh varisht aironotical vaigyanik biju uthup kii aguai vaale edie ke vishisht khand ko ummid he ki aayiuasavi ke namoonay kaa 2016 tak pareekshan kar liya jayega
 At present, IUSAV is the newest face in the line of equally strong 'flying wing' steel drones being developed all over the world

 I'm sure if this movie was a lot shorter, i would have enjoyed it much more
 Instead, it drags on for too long where i found myself nodding off
 
 
 It's another movie based on true events
 Had the movie focused more on the lead up to the Batla House incident and then the aftermath, it may have been more interesting to watch
 The scenes in the courtroom are just ridiculous and disappointing
 
 
 John Abraham was good as the main lead
 He is looking super buff; I'm pretty sure the size of his knee is the size of my thigh
 i found Mrunal Thakur’s character annoying, i can’t put my finger on it but, she was irritating
 Nora Fatehi has a very small role
 Her dancing skills are amazing so watch out for the # osakisaki dance number
 
 
 As far as thriller's go, this movie has no thrills
 If you choose to watch it, make sure you have a strong cup of coffee
 
 
 2 out of 5 stars
 Remember, it’s my opinion!

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may be openly opposed to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, but despite his opposition, Modi's posters are being displayed in his programs and that too, describing Modi as the 'next Prime Minister'
 mukhyamantri seva yatra ke dauraan jab gaya jila pahunche to unke swaagat main modi kaa poster pehle se hi chaspa tha
 These posters show Modi as the future Prime Minister
 aisa nahin he ki yah keval gaya main seva yatra ke dauraan dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Earlier, during the visit in Gopalganj, the Chief Minister got a similar view
 aisa nahin he ki yah poster puure kshetra main lagaae ja rahe hai
 Posters have been placed along the routes that Nitish is going to pass during the Seva Yatra
 poster main likhaa he 'namo namo, jan jan kii aawaaj or 2014 main narendra modi kii sarkaar'
 These are being pasted near the posters of Nitish's Seva Yatra
 gauratlab he ki nitish kii modi se naaraazgi ek vigyaapan ke kaaran hi shuru hui thi
 Following the Gujarat government's help in the Kosi floods in Bihar, a newspaper published an advertisement showing Nitish and Modi together, after which Nitish began to distance himself from Modi
 us samay is vigyaapan ko lekar nitish kii naaraazgi khule taur par sabake saamne aa gai thi
 He even talked about returning help from the Gujarat government

 However, Pandey also says that these posters have not been put up by the State Committee or District Committee
 udhar, jediu ke ek netaa kehete hai ki ye poster bhadakaau or rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) ko nuksaan pahunchane ke liye lagaaya ja rahaa he
 a section of the BJP is against the JDU, which is putting up such posters
 netaa kehete hai ki party in postaron par gaur kar rahi he lekin abhi kuch kahana nahin chaahati
 It is worth mentioning that Nitish has started a service trip in the state from May 1

 The report said that the boys in the party were armed and had taken action against those who attacked themselves, but after this they were caught and then beheaded
 unhone kaha, 'bijepi ne tikat nahin diya, ab maine party chhodane kaa faisla kiya he
 Speaking to NDTV, Udit Raj had said, 'kejriwal's call came yesterday
 aaj maine kol kiya tha wo hans rahe the ki unhone 4 maheene pehle mujhe chetavanee di thi ki mujhe tikat nahin milegaa

 jammu- kashmir vidhansabha bhang ho gai he
 With this, all the exercises to form a government there have been put to a break
 agle maheene 16 taarikh ko rajyapal shashan khatm hone vaala tha
 But before this, the Governor took a big decision
 sawaal uth rahe hai ki rajyapal ke faisle se sabase zyada dhakka kis party ko laga he
 If the parties blink, the three major opposition parties PDP, National Conference (NC) and Congress are cursing the Governor in unison, but the pdp's displeasure is more special
 vidhansabha bhang hone se agar kisi ko sabase zyada ghaataa hua he, to vah pidipi he
 The PDP was in the previous government and Mehbooba Mufti was the chief minister
 unhone sarkaar banane ke liye bhaajapa se haath milaayaa tha, jiske khilaaf unki puraani adaavat thi
 He had said that this had to be done to save Kashmir
 ab vah apni dhur virdohi neshnal conference se haath mila baithi
 Opponent legislators got the issue
 Opponents are saying that Mehbooba can join hands with anyone for power
 pehle bhi un par aarope lagate rahe ki kashmiriyon par palat gan chalavane waalon se haath mila liya
 Now the biggest challenge before him is to keep the mlas in check, because many party mlas are in contact with other parties
 ve kisi vakt paala badal sakate hai
 As soon as the news of the rebellion in the PDP came to light with the formation of a government with the NC and the Congress, many PDP leaders began to rebel
 pehle bhi party ke kai vidhayakon ne mahabuuba par manmarjee se sarkaar chalaane or vanshavaad ko badhaava dene kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The resentment among PDP leaders increased further after the talk of alliance with NC, Congress
 yahaan tak ki party ke varisht netaa or saansad mujffar hossain beg ne bagawati tevar akhriyaar karte hue teesraa morcha banane kii baat kii
 Baig had made up his mind to support the BJP by forming a Third Front with the People's Conference
 haalanki unki yah muraad puri na ho saki kyonki uske pehle hi vidhansabha bhang ho gai
 Now whatever will happen, the decision will be made only through elections
 beg pidipi ke kaddavar netaaon main ek hai
 His statement is significant that 'about a year ago, the Committee on Amendment of the Constitution of PDP was formed and made the Chairman
 unhone kuch sawaal mahabuuba ko bheje the, lekin aaj tak unka jawaab nahin aayaa
 "muzaffar Baig," i will decide my future only when Mehbooba responds to my statement today
 agar pidipi koi notice nahin leti to main sanghathan badal saktaa hum
 'baig's statement is enough to explain what phase Mehbooba Mufti and her party PDP are going through
 aabid raja ansaari bhi kaaphi naarazbeg ke baad aabid raja ansaari kaa naam aata he jo apni hi party pidipi or mahabuuba se khaase naaraaz bataae jate hai
 It was a few months ago when three party mlas expressed their antagonistic intent after making many allegations against Mehbooba Mufti
 unka saaf sanket tha ki mahabuuba siyaasi pintara badalanaa choden anyathaa ve koi or rasta akhriyaar kar sakate hai
 The most special name among these leaders was Abid Raza Ansari, MLA from Jadbal constituency in Srinagar
 ansaari ne party ke netaaon naeem akhtar, wahid paara, pirjada mansoor or sartaaj madani par nishaanaa sadhate hue unpar gambhir aarope lagaae or party chhodane tak kii dhamkee di
 Resentment among 14 mlas: As per Ansari, he is in touch with at least 14 PDP mlas who are dissatisfied and ready to leave the party 
 ansaari ne naeem akhtar, pirjada mansoor, wahid ur rahamaan paara or sartaaj madani par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki party kii sthapana purv mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said kii ore se unke khun kii peshkash se kii gai, jise unki naakaabil beti or anya sadasyon ne barbaad kar diya
 If Ansari has a point and 14 mlas are on the verge of collapse, then the PDP will not survive in the name of the party and it will be difficult to save its existence in the state

 Is sent for doctoron ne bataaya he ki unhen ilaaj shuru karne ko lekar koi aadesh nahin mila he

 com On Monday, there was a holiday in banks on the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti
 aise main baaki dinon kii tulana main atm main cash ke liye logon kii or lambii line lagi
 On Saturday and Sunday, despite the holiday, it was announced to open the bank and post office, but on Monday, the bank employees got a break
 is vajah se somvaar ko eksgenj or baikon main lenden kaa koi kaam nahin hua
 So people got upset
 haalanki, atm ne bhi logon kii pareshaani kam nahin kii
 So far, only 100 notes can be withdrawn from atms, because 500 and 2000 new notes are not coming out in most ATM machines
 sarkaar ne daawa jarur kiya he ki mangalvaar se atm sabhi tarah ke note nikaalane lagegi, lekin lambii linon se kab chhutkaaraa milegaa kisi ko pataa nahin
 On Monday, atms were the only recourse for people, as neither the banks were open nor the post offices, which were engaged in the work of exchanging notes for the last five days
 ek dilachasp tathy ye bhi he ki lambii or badi line note badalawaane kii he, bajaae ki apane khaaton main paisa jamaa karaane waalon yaa khate se paisa nikaalane waalon kii
 The reason for this is also because there is no record of changing the old notes in their account
 idi jarur lee ja rahi he, lekin usamen back kii detail ho, ye jaruri nahin he
 Pankaj Kumar got the first success in three times engaged in ATM lines
 do baar pehle ghanton line main jarur lage the, lekin jab tak unki baari aati note khatm ho gaye the
 The same situation was with Priya, they have sufficient amount of old notes of 500 and 1000, but there are no such notes which can be spent in the market
 ab mushkil ye he ki ek maatr vikalp atm hi he, jisamen unako pataa nahin kitni der line main laganaa pade

 According to reports, the doors have been opened at 12:15 pm
 ab agle saptaah 3 may ko kedarnath or 6 may ko badrinaath dham ke kapaat khole jaaenge
 It is worth noting that every year, Akshaya Tritiya has the tradition of opening the doors of the dham
 kapaat deepawali ke din tak khule rahete hai
 These are then closed
 shrriddhaluon ke liye khule kedarnath ke kapaat, shuru hui chaar dham yatragangotri dham kaa mahatvadharmik manyataon ke anusaar gangotri dham vahiin sthaan he, jahaan dharti par maa ganga avatarit hui thim
 There is a temple of Maa Ganga here
 yahaan ek aisi chattan he jise shivlinga ke rup main puja jaataa he
 It does not appear every month in the year
 thand ke aarambh main jab ganga main pani kaa str neeche jaataa he keval tabhi iske darshan hote hai
 This place is also related to Lord Rama
 puranic kathaon ke anusaar, bhagwaan ram ke purvaj raja bhagirath ne yaheen par bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya kii thi
 Such is the temple of Yamunotri Dhamayhan Devi Yamuna
 iske aasapaas garm pani ke kai strot hai, jo kai kundon main girte hai
 People who come here cook food in the pool of hot water and offer it to the Goddess
 sabase zyada prasiddh surya kunda he, jahaan kaa pani kaaphi garm rahata he
 There is a rock named Divya Shala near this Kund, people worship it before worshiping the mother
 'khamosh' unka sabase pasandida dialog he par lagata he yahi shabd kahin unpar baari na pad jaae
 It is feared that Bahari Babu, who has made everyone 'silent' by saying 'silent', may not have to be 'silent' himself in front of the biggest rally in Bihar this time
 janata shatrughna sinha ke munh se 'khamosh' sune bina unhen nahin chhodti, lekin lagata he modi ke saamne shatrughna sinha ko 'khamosh' bolne kaa mauka bhi na mili, kyonki ab tak bolne waalon kii list main unka naam nahin he
 Shatrughan Sinha, who once raised the flag of anti-modi, is now praising Modi, but there is doubt that Bihari Babu will be able to address the crowd gathered for Modi
 modi kii raily shatrughna sinha ke sansadeey kshetra patna ke gandhi maidan main ho rahi he
 The names of those speaking on the stage have been approved by the BJP so far, the name of Bihari Babu is not there
 bijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh seepi thakur ke mutabik modi ke alaava rajnath singh, arun jetali or sushamaa swaraj bolenge, lekin ab tak duusare bolne vaale netaaon ke naam jari nahin hue hai
 Shatrughan Sinha is also aware that there may be questions on his speech, because till recently his image has been anti-modi
 duusare agar mauka bhi mili to modi samarthak bheed unhen manch par bolne par hangaamaa kar sakati he
 In such a situation, Bihari Babu is trying to get wind
 yahi vajah he ki shatrughna sinha khud ko mejabaan or modi ko duulhaa qaraar de rahe hai
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Sinha said, 'I will not cry or thunder, i will not say it or not, it does not matter much
 isliye ki meraa to home state he, ye meraa ghar he, meraa kshetra he
 The groom on that day is Narendra Modi
 abhi sara josh-kharosh modi ke liye he taaki wo ham sab ko lekar dilli ke liye kooch karen isliye meraa bolnaa myne nahin rakhata
 'in front of the crowd, bjp's eclipse rally in Patna is eclipsed by Bihari Babu from Modi's stage, but every effort is being made to get Bihari Babu to speak
 par ab modi kii reliyon main duusare netaaon ko nahin sunne kii pravriti ne kai netaaon ko khud alag rahane par majaboor kar diya he
 In such a situation many leaders also want to keep themselves out of the list of those who give speeches

 Addressing a meeting of party workers on the first day of her three-day visit to her parliamentary constituency, Sonia Gandhi questioned the functioning of the Mayawati government and said that the central government is paying thousands of crores to the Uttar Pradesh government for various development and welfare schemes
 But it is not being used correctly
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe is baat kii jaankaree he ki pradesh kii janata khaad, beej, bijli, pani jaisi moolbhoot samasyaon se grast he
 'sonia said,' The central government pays thousands of thousands of rupees to the Uttar Pradesh government for various development and welfare schemes
 magar uskaa sahi dhang se upyog nahin ho rahaa he
 The Congress president pointed to the allegations of the Chief Minister's step-dealing with the state on the central government and paying special attention to Rae Bareli and Amethi, saying, "how is the behavior of the Uttar Pradesh government with Rae Bareli and Amethi hidden from anyone?" Is not
 ‘ sonia ne party kaaryakartaaon evam netaaon kaa aahwan karte hue kaha ki raibareli or amethi ke log ekajute hokar apni aawaaj uthaaen, taaki yojanaon evam vikaas ke laabh se unhen vanchit na kiya ja sake
 He said, 'if we all work together, we will vigilantly monitor the central schemes, only then they can be implemented properly and the public will get their benefits
 ' unhone party kaaryakartaaon se apane saamaajik or raajnneetik dayitvon kaa puri nisthapurvak paalan karne kaa aahwan karte hue kaha ki janata kii samasyaon se dil or dimag se judakar hi ham apane dayitvon kaa nirvahan kar paayenge

 vitt mantri pranav mukherjee ne kaha, ‘‘khaadya mudrasphiti main maujuuda rukh swaagat yogya he or hamen aagaamee saptaah main isamen or narmi aane kii ummid he
 However, concerns over the prices of non-food items may remain

 kisi vishvavidhyalay kii paaramparik kaksha ke bare main kalpana kiijie
 Students are moving around in class
 kuch chaatr ekadam aage baithna pasand karte hai kuch peeche ko peeche kii bench par, or kuch to class main aate hi nahin
 The professor lectured for 45 minutes, posing some questions
 kaksha sthagit kar di jaati he or chaatr agali class main chale jate hai
 Every day the same pattern is repeated for a few days or weeks before the exam, then the students start trying to cram everything
 yah niskriy shikshan paddati he kyonki chaatr baithkar bahut kam sakriyata ke saath chupchaap jaankariyaan grahan karte hanchook kahaan ho rahi he?parikshaayen jab tak sir par nahin aa jaatin, shaayad hi kahin seekhney-sikhaane kii koi prakriya dikhti he
 How many students understood what was taught in class? How many people understood anything more than a few phrases without even assimilating it? How many people were not listening? For those who took notes in class, were they understanding their meaning or was it just like dictation for them? If we feel that most of our students understand our lecture for most of the time then as a teacher we are confused
 ham professors apane lectures ko chaahe kitna bhi adhik dilachasp kyon na maanate hon, par kai tarah kii bhaawanaaon main duubate-utaraate kishoron kaa class ke baad, kuch saptaah ke baad, yaa kuch maheenon ke baad, dhyaan banaae rakhana mushkil he
 What is the solution? In active learning, the student participates in it
 yah chaatr ke dimag ko apane saath vyast karata he
 When students are actively involved in class rather than sitting quietly, engagement and focus is maximized
 yah active larning kaa aadhaar he; sakriy bhagidaari dimag ko sakriy karti he, jo badale main seekhney ko badhaava detii he
 Meditation automatically becomes focused
 ham class main upasthiti ko anivaary kar sakate hai, par kisi chaatr ke shaareerik rup se kaksha main maujuud hone kaa matlab yah nahin hota ki vah maansik rup se bhi vahiin maujuud he
 Strategic real time communication or instant communication, what students have learned must go through their mind at the same time and clearly
 har class main, sabhi chaatro ko bulaakar unhen bataane ko kaha janaa chahie ki unhone kya siikhaa he or ve maukhik rup se apni pratikriyaayein de sakate hai
 To keep the mind focused, there is nothing better than asking students to speak on that subject
 class kaa tarika badal denchatro ko class se pehle hi bataanaa chahie ki kis cheez par charchaa honi he taaki ve uske bare main jaankaree lekar aaen or class main us par charchaa karen
 Professors may ask to make short, focused readings in advance, and clarify that students may be asked briefly what they have read
 sirf theory nahin uskaa prayog bhiyadi chaatr keval siddhant ko samaj rahe hai, asal jivan main unke istemaal yaa unke udaahranon se ve parichit nahin hai to phir ve vastav main kuch bhi nahin sikh rahe
 The art of active learning is that in which students are connected to what they already know and who are learning new
 aakhri samay kii rattamari nahinaap puch sakate hai, ''kya jo kuch siikhaa he, parikshaayen use maapne kaa paimaana nahin hai or chaatro ke liye semester ke dauraan lagaataar sikhte rahanaa mahatvapurn kyon he yadi ve pariksha se thik pehle saamagree ko jaldi se grahan kar sakate hai?'' uttar saral he: agar seekhney kaa kaam sirf pariksha se thik pehle ek choti avadhi main ho to chijen jitani teji se sikhi jaati hai utani hi teji se ve dimag se gaayab bhi ho jaati hai
 Use it or lose it
 If you do not keep repeating what you have learned, then the benefit of learning ends soon
 paathyakram or silebus ko niyamit rup se doharaana chahie or jo kuch bhi siikhaa he uskaa istemaal karnaa chahie, use chizon se jodpha chahie
 In this way, exams that are the mainstay of the passive learning method can become a means of powerful active learning if they are conducted more often during the semester rather than just once or twice
 saat minute kaa niyamalakchar par dhyaan kendrit karne ke liye logon ko saat minute tak aatm-niyantran jaruri he
 After this, they retreat from their inner mental world
 yadi professor ko chaatro se samvaad karne kii jarurat he, to yah saat minute se zyada ke packet main nahin hona chahie

 After this, other leaders will get a chance

 The cabinet ministers will get 15-15 minutes while the ministers of state will get 10-10 minutes

 ye wo nishkasit party netaa hai jinhone emsidi chunaavon ke vakt party ke khilaaf baghawat kaa jhanda buland kar diya tha, jiske baad bijepi ne unhen party se nikaal diya tha
 The BJP has offered expelled party leaders and activists to join
 jo log party ko dobaaraa shaamil hona chaahate hai wo sirf request patr dekar shaamil ho sakate hai
 In fact, Delhi BJP has entrusted the responsibility to Delhi BJP General Secretary Ravindra Gupta

 lekin 2019 chunaav ke najadik aate hi party ne apni taiyaari shuru kar di he, jisamen puraane baagiyon ko shaamil karnaa bhi shaamil tha
 Leaders and activists who want to rejoin the party should be given an opportunity, so that the BJP can fight the 2019 Lok Sabha elections with full force and once again repeat the history of 2014 and win all the seven seats in Delhi

 somvaar ko duusari baar hui monsoon kii barish se conot place or puraani dilli ko jodne vaale minto road par 10 feet tak pani bhar gaya
 Dinesh Mohania, vice chairman of Delhi Jal Board and MLA from Sangam Vihar, has blamed the BJP headquarters for filling the water on Minto Road
 prasal aadhe ghante kibarishhote hi minto road par 10 feet tak pani bhar gaya tha jisase bas tak dub gayi thim
 Questions arise about this when water gets collected repeatedly on the Minto Road railway underpass as soon as it rains
 jab isko lekar dinesh mohaniya se sawaal poocha gaya to unhone deen dayaal upaadhyaay maarg par bane bijepi mukhyalay ko iske liye jimmedaar tehraaya
 He said that the Delhi Jal Board closed the huge drain of the British era for the drainage of rainy water near the BJP headquarters for security reasons and connected it to the small drain near the Kali temple
 chota naala pani ke dabaav ko nahin jhel paa rahaa he
 Due to this, the Minto Road gets flooded as soon as there is heavy rain
 unhone ye bhi bataaya ki bahut hi purana bada naala pahadganj main banaaya gaya tha
 Which used to pass in front of BJP headquarters on Deendayal Marg
 isamen aane vaala pani itio ke paas naale main girtaa tha, lekin ab us bade naale ko bijepi mukhyalay ke paas band kar diya gaya or kaali badi mandir ke paas chote naale se jod diya gaya
 Now the problem is that due to the low width, the small drain is not able to withstand water pressure and overflows
 dinesh mohaniya ne kaha ki iskaa samaadhaan tabhi he jab minto road se itio kii taraf jane vaali sadak par bane bade naale se ise jodenge

 saal 2011 main gramin kshetron main purush or mahila shram bal bhagidaari kaa faasla jahaan kareeb 30 fisadi rahaa, vahiin shahari kshetron main yah kareeb 40 fisadi rahaa
 The need to take steps in the interest of women
 Now the question arises as to why the labor force participation of women is decreasing despite all efforts and programs of the Government of India
 asocham ke sujhavonke mutabik shram bal main mahilaon kii bhagidaari badhaane ke liye vishesh skill develop training, chote shaharon main rojgaar ke avasar, bacchon or bujurgon kii dekharekh ke liye care centre, surakshit work enwyrement, surakshit shahar-sadak, mahila orietend bank, ONLY women police stesan jaise kuch mahatvapurn kadam sarkaar ko uthaane honge
 Women activists also expressed concern after the report that if the working women are to be believed then the society will have to change the thinking and attitude towards women
 saamaajik bandishon main jakadane kii bajaay unhen jab tak surakshit maahaul nahin milegaa
 It will not be possible to reduce this gap
 women activist bhi is report ko chintajanak maanate hai
 According to the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, a 10 percent increase in the FLFP rate to 0 in GDP
 3 fisadi vruddhi ho sakati he
 Therefore, it is important that the government seriously implement policies and programs to increase the labor force ratio of women in the country

 In the labor market, women receive lower wages in both urban and rural areas

 But given the way in India women are victims of discrimination in many other areas, it does not seem possible to happen soon

 karnataka main sabhi multiplex or single screen theatre maalik ab ek tikat ke liye 200 rupee se zayaada nahin vasuul paaenge
 The Karnataka government has passed an order that the rate of tickets for all categories except IMAX and Gold class of all theaters can be more than 200 rupees
 haalanki is rakam par manoranjan kar bhi lagegaa
 Kannada films are exempt from entertainment tax in Karnataka, while the government levies 30 percent entertainment tax on second language films
 yani, agar tikat kii dar 100 rupee theatre ke maalik tay karte hai to isaki counter par keemat 30 fisadi manoranjan kar ke saath 130 rupee hogi
 However, in many theaters, one to five rupees are charged for cleanliness, AC also

 karnataka main kannada filmein manoranjan kar se mukt hai, jabaki duusari bhashaa kii filmon par 30 fisadi manoranjan kar sarkaar vasuulati he
 That is, if the theater owner decides the ticket rate to Rs 100, then the counter will be priced at Rs 130 with 30% entertainment tax
 haalanki kai cinemagharon main ek se 5 rupaya saaf-safai, asi ke liye bhi vasule jate hai
 The comments jab sarkaar 200 rupee kaa slab taiy kar rahi thi, tab hamane bengaluru ke brigade road par bane rex theater ke maalik anil kapur se unki pratikriya leni chaahi
 He said that the price of land in the city is skyrocketing and it costs crores of rupees to build a modern theater

 saal 2016 main punjab ke purv mantri bikram singh majithia par dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne 'nashe ke kaarobaar main lipt hone' kaa aarope lagaaya or ab unase maafee maang lee
 By doing this, Kejriwal is demonstrating his tremendous ability to disengage from his words
 19 march ko unhone kendriya mantri nitin gadakari, congress netaa kapil sibbal or unke bete amit sibbal ke khilaaf lagaae gaye apane aaropon ke liye bhi aisa hi pachhtaawaa or malaal jaahir kiya
 In separate written apologies Kejriwal accepted the allegations of 'unverified' and 'baseless' allegations and insisted that he had nothing 'personal' against the people he defamed with his statements
 lekin siyaasi virodhiyon ke khilaaf is kadar jehar ugalane vaale netaa main achaanak itnaa pashchaatap kaise aa gaya? aam aadmi party ke sutron kaa kahana he ki kejariwal 2013 se hi apane khilaaf chal rahe manahani ke 33 mukademon main se harek ko court ke baahar sulah se nibataana chaahate hai
 These lawsuits are having a bad effect on the party's financial resources
 sutron ke mutabik, 18 march ko dipti siem manish sisodiya ke ghar par punjab ke kuch vidhayakon se unhone yah bhi kaha ki shchunavi saal main ve adalati mukademon main uljhe rahanaa nahin chaahate
 Sources said that similar reconciliation agreements are expected soon with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit and BJP leader Ramesh Vidhuri — they have also filed defamation cases against Kejriwal
 jetali se bhi unhone maafee maangi he lekin jetali ne unhen maaf karne se inkaar karte hue cese ko anjaam tak le jane kii baat kahi he
 Kejriwal's efforts to settle the cases against him, especially his 'clean chit' given to Majithia, created a huge crisis within the AAP
 party kii punjab ikai dophaad ho gai or uske 20 main se 14 vidhayak 'dilli se duuri banane' ke liye jor dene lage
 Many of them want to launch a 'new regional party'
 kai vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki kejariwal ne 'nashe ke kaarobaar main mileebhagat ke liye majithia' ko alag se unka naam lekar jis tarah kathghare main khadaa kiya tha, usne us vakt gaddinshin akali-bhaajapa gathbandhan sarkaar ke khilaaf matadaataaon main naaraazgi paidaa karne main madad kii thi
 Sukhpal Khaira, leader of the AAP in the Punjab Assembly, said in a tweet on March 15, "today we are annoyed and shocked by Arvind Kejriwal's apology, we have no hesitation in assuming that we do not advise on the surrender of a leader of his stature Was taken
 ''ek din baad aap ke rajya sanyojak bhagwant maan or sah-sanyojak aman aroda ne bhi apane istife twit kar die, jinamein maan ne is 'nae takalifdeh ghatnakram' ko istife kii vajah bataaya
 On 17 March, 14 Punjab mlas turned down Sisodia's offer of reconciliation with Kejriwal
 khera kii aguai main vidhayakon ne kaha ki chizon ko bigadgaye se bachaane kaa akelaa tarika nai party launch karnaa he
 On the other hand, Sanjay Singh, recently awarded Rajya Sabha membership, refused to support the 'clean chit' of AAP supremo given to Majithia on 17 March
 unhone kaha, ''maine pehle jo kuch bhi kaha he, us par kaayam hum
 "punjab has an immediate result, but it has to be seen how the voters of Delhi react to the 'apologies'
" *** The Aam Aadmi Party has made posters and banners a big weapon for campaigning in MCD elections
 party prachaar ke aakiri kuch dinon main jhaadoo haath main lekar safai kar rahe arvind kejariwal kii tasviir kaa jamkar istemaal kar rahi he
 Banners of a picture of a broom in the hands of Kejriwal have been put up all over Delhi
 dilli ko chamakaane kaa vaadaam aadmi party ne emsidi chunaav main kooda mukt dilli kaa daawa kiya he
 Whose Arvind Kejriwal is seen saying in his public meeting that if AAP gets power in MCD, then it will make Delhi shine like London within a year
 aap netaaon ke mutabik agar dilli sarkaar bijli pani ke vaade ko puraa kar sakati he to arvind kejariwal dilli kii safai ke vaade ko bhi puraa karenge
 According to the promises that will be made in the manifesto, the Aam Aadmi Party will include big claims for its employees in its manifesto
 jisamen safai karmchaariyon ko har maheene kii 7 taarikh ko selary milane, health beemaa or kooda saaf karne ke dauraan istemaal hone vaali suraksha kit dene kaa vaada kiya ja saktaa he
 Significantly, the Aam Aadmi Party is considering the last week of campaign as very important
 yahi vajah he kiarvind kejarivalpani jansabha main safai, bhrashtachar, bijli-pani kaa rate, house tex maaf or emsidi ke ghotaale jaise bade muddon par hi focus rakhane vaale hai
 At present, Arvind Kejriwal himself has held the broom in the MCD election for the public vote, it has to be seen how successful he is in cleaning the Congress and BJP with this new poster

 Mumbai Police also arrested a total of 8 Shiv Sainiks while taking action on them

 a freak attacker showed such devastation of death and destruction in the school of children, in which 28 innocents have died, mostly small children
 hamalavar kii bhi maut ho chuki he lekin puure ilaake main dehshat he
 The firing at the school also shook the US President Barack Obama
 hwite house main patrakaron se baat karte hue america ke raashtrapati ro pade
 His trembling was speaking more than the words of the President of America
 unki aawaaj to sanbhalee hui, dabi hui, buji hui si thi lekin unka cheharaa chilla-chilla kar bol rahaa tha
 He was repeatedly trying to handle the pain that was dripping through the eyes
 chaar minute ke apane is sambodhan main obama ne saat baar aansu pochhe or teen baar kaha ki aaj meraa dil tut gaya he
 There is also a reason for Barack Obama's helplessness
 ye koi aatanki ghatana nahin thi
 It was not even racist violence
 ye ek sanakee kaa paagalpan tha, jo achaanak insaan se shaitan ban baitha, jo maut kaa saamaan ne lekar masuumon ke skool pahucha, andhadhundh firing kar di or khud ko bhi goli maar lee
 The biggest question is that after all, a society that claims to be the most civilized, where the society claims to give the most opportunities to its people
 vahaan is tarah kaa paagalpan baar-baar saamne kyo aa rahaa he
 Sometimes firing in school, sometimes firing in the mall and sometimes slaughtering in the gurdwara
 gurudwara golicond main 7 logon kii maut ke baad raashtrapati obama ne shaayad sach hi kaha tha ki ye america ke liye aatmamanthan kaa vakt he

 sumitra mahajan ne kaha ki hindustan itnaa bada desh he
 It is not right for anyone to say anything anywhere and to disrupt the House on this subject

 After the names of four ministers of Uttar Pradesh government Surendra Singh Patel, Shahid Manzoor, Balram Yadav and Om Prakash Singh and Assembly Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey are seen in the Samajwadi Party's list for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the politics of the party is being viewed with different glasses
 is
 mana ja rahaa he ki in diggajon ko tikat dekar party ne doharaa daanv chalaa he
 If these leaders win, then they will enter the politics of the Center and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav will get rid of the hassle of admiring his seniority
 or kahin inamen se kuch wicket loksabhaa chunaav main gir gaye to unka kad khud-ba-khud kam ho jayega
 With the enthusiasm and humility of these leaders who won the party ticket, it seems that this strategy of SP has been successful to a great extent
 meerut loksabhaa kshetra se tikat paane vaale mantri or kithore (meerut) se vidhayak shahid manjuur kehete hai, ‘‘main puure man se chunaav lard rahaa hum
 It is a great deal for me to get into national politics
 yah kahana ki kisi ko yahaan se hataane ke liye chunaav ladvaya ja rahaa he, saraasar bebuniyaad he
 "but the party has not been able to wield this bet on the powerful minister Azam Khan so far
 tamaam shishtachar ke baavjood ajam khan or mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke bich asahaj rishte kisi se chhipe nahin hai
 Why delay in declaring Rampur ticket? Party's national spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary clarifies, "candidates will be announced by the end of December on all seats, including Rampur
 ” rampur se ajam khan bhi utaare ja sakate hai? ‘‘dekhie, vahaan se ajam sahab chahen to khud chunaav lard len yaa jise chahen ladava den
 They only have to decide Rampur
 ” choudhary kaa jawaab tha
 But Khan does not seem to be in a mood to move away from Uttar Pradesh for the time being
 kya netaji ke kehane par ve loksabhaa chunaav ladenge? tapaak se hajir tha unka jawaab, ‘‘awwal to netaji aisa kahenge hi nahin
 Second is that my city is very poor
 ise nawabon ne itnaa lutaa he ki main iske liye uttar pradesh main rahakar hi kaam kar paaungaa
 i am not interested in the Lok Sabha elections
 ”party ke is kaddavar muslim netaa ke jehan main vaise do-teen naam hai
 "there is a long time in the election
" mere dimag main do-teen naam hai
 The name will be revealed when the time comes
 jahaan tak jai pradaa kaa sawaal he to agar ve party me ain to usase pehle unke ‘wo’ (sanket amar singh kii ore) aaenge
 And the party will not be able to tolerate his 'she'
 ” ajam ke tevar to soobe main hi khunta gaadkar siyasat karne vaale hai
 Now the party has to decide how she creates new equations with them

 Bollywood directors will need better end and second half fuel to make their film run at the box office for a longer period of time
 aise daur main jab kamedi or halke-phulke mizaaj kii filmein aa rahi hai, aurangzeb alag tarah kii ummid jagaati he
 How much of the story is related to two families of Gurgaon

 The police target his son Ajay (arjun Kapoor) to reach Yashvardhan and send his enemy Vishal to his place
 ek taraf jaiki shroff kaa parivaar he to duusari ore ravikant (rishi kapur) kii pulisia family he
 The entire drama is woven around this
 kahani speed ke saath chalati he
 But after the first half, the plot of the story is seen coming out of the hands of the director
 ant bhi thodaa tang karata he
 The story seems complicated at some places
 dialog achche hai lekin saleem-javed ko samarpit hone kii vajah se kahin-kahin thunse hue se bhi lagate hai
 Research is good, but treatment is a bit weak
 star apiorjun kapur chaa gaye hai
 Seeing them, it does not seem that this is his second film

 Rishi Kapoor is getting amazing with his growing age

 Prithviraj can be called Surprise Package
 sasha aagaa kaa kaam film main glamer kaa tadakaa lagane kaa he
 Apart from this, many stars in the film like Jackie Shroff, Amrita Singh and Deepti Naval have also done a good job
 lekin arjuna-rishi-prithviraj kii tikdi kamaal he
 The story earning is the medium budget
 film kii publicity is tarah se kii gai he ki ise lekar darshakon main kaaphi craij he
 But the problem faced with Hindi films also lies with it
 second half jaayaka bigaadta he
 Overall, Aurangzeb is a must-see thriller because in the new era stars like Arjun are few who carry the risk

 Nepal
 
 Rajasthan and not knowing where she was looking, she was wandering in Mohali district of Punjab
 isse pehle use burke main rajdhani dilli kii saiyr karte hue dekha gaya tha
 By the way, Burke saved a little shame from the police
 ab police ke paas kehane ko to he ki dilli main kis-kis kaa burka uthaa kar dekhte ki andar koun he?jab dilli kii sisitivi footage saamne ai thi to usamen jis mahila kohnipritabataya gaya wo badahavaas, baichaiyn or dari hui nazar ai thi
 He wore white salwar, gray coat and black scarf
 haathon main file or purse tha
 On the basis of that footage, Honeypreet's lawyer claimed that the video is from Honeypreet
 sisitivi main uski tasviren us vaqt record hui thi, jab vah agrim zamaanat ke kaagazat par sin karne ke liye dilli ke lajpat nagar main apane vakil ke daftar main pahunchi thi
 Honeypreet's expressions
 uski chaal dhaal se hi uske camere main kaid hone kaa daawa kiya gaya tha
 Actually, the woman seen in the footage was moving her left hand full front and back while walking
 vaise hi haniprit ke chalane ke jo reel or real footage hai

 So, should we assume that the woman seen on CCTV was Honeypreet
 kya vaaki main jis haniprit ko saat-saat rajyon or do mulkon main dhundha gaya wo rajdhani dilli ai thi or phir punjab main jaakar chup gai thi
 If this is so, then it is truly a wonderful honey from Baba
