 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke ishaare par bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari ke kilaaf party ke bheetar se prachaar chal rahaa he
 This allegation has been made by senior RSS leader MG Vaidya in his blog
 vaidya ke mutabik modi pradhanmantri bananaa chaahate hai or unhen lagata he ki gadakari unhen yah hasarat puri nahin karne denge
 Vaidya has written that Advani and Gadkari have refused to be the Prime Minister, whereas Modi has not said this
 vaidya kaa yah bhi kahana he ki agar ram jethmalani ko koi shikaayat he to vah unhen party ke bheetar rakhni chahie na ki saarvajanik kerani chahie
 Vaidya does not stop here, he says that the BJP should not announce its prime ministerial candidate right now
 vahiin sangh ne vaidya ke is bayaan par kaha he ki yah unki nijee raay he sangh kii nahin
 MG Vaidya has advised Jaswant Singh Yashwant Sinha and Shatrughan Sinha to resign from the party like Mahesh Jethmalani if he is so angry
 aresas ke varisht netaa emji vaidya nitin gadakari ke samarthan main khulkar saamne aa gaye hai or narendra modi ko aade haathon liya he
 Vaidya has written in his blog that Modi is running a campaign against Nitin Gadkari
 unka tark he ki jab ram jethmalani ne bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari kaa istipha maanga tha tab unhone narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad ke liye ummidavaar banane kii bhi baat kahi thi
 Vaidya says that Narendra Modi feels that Gadkari can be a barrier between him and the Prime Minister
 yahi vajah he ki modi gadakari ko party ke adhyaksh pad se hataanaa chaahate hai or iske liye ram jethmalani kaa sahaara le rahe hai
 In the blog, Vaidya has also expressed displeasure over BJP MP Ram Jethmalani publicly making statements against Gadkari
 unke mutabik, agar jethmalani ko gadakari se koi shikaayat he to vah party ke manch par apni baat rakh sakate the
 What is the need to go out and make a statement for this? tippaniyan BJP President Nitin Gadkari has issued a statement on this issue
 isamen kaha gaya he ki meraa dhyaan varisht patrkaar emji vaidya ke marathi blog kii ore dilaayaa gaya he
 The essence of this blog has also been published in a section of the media
 lekhak ne haal main party ke ek saansad kii tippaniyon ko narendra modi se jodne kii koshish kii he
 The BJP completely rejects any such attempt, as it has no basis
 party ke sabhi kendriya netaa or mukhyamantri party ke liye puri tarah milakar kaam kar rahe hai
 We are contesting the Gujarat assembly elections with mutual trust and unity
 bijepi puri tarah ek hokar majbootee se narendra modi ke saath khadi he or hamen vishwaas he ki aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko shandaar jeet hasil hogi
 According to Vaidya, Modi wants to become Prime Minister and he feels that Gadkari will not let him fulfill this desire
 vaidya ne likhaa he ki adwani or gadakari pradhanmantri hone ke liye manaa kar chuke hai jabaki modi ne yah baat nahin kahi he
 Vaidya also says that if Ram Jethmalani has any complaints, he should keep them within the party and not make it public
 vaidya yaheen nahin rukate unka kahana he ki bijepi abhi apane pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa elaan na kare
 At the same time, the Sangh has said on Vaidya's statement that this is his personal opinion and not the Sangh's
 emji vaidya ne jaswant singh yashavanth sinha or shatrughna sinha ko salaah di he ki agar unhen itani naaraazgi he to vah mahesh jethmalani kii tarah party se istipha de den
 Senior RSS leader MG Vaidya has come out openly in support of Nitin Gadkari and has taken on Narendra Modi
 vaidya ne apane blog main likhaa he ki nitin gadakari ke khilaaf modi campan chalaa rahe hai
 He argues that when Ram Jethmalani sought BJP President Nitin Gadkari's resignation, he also talked about making Narendra Modi the candidate for the post of Prime Minister
 vaidya kaa kahana he ki narendra modi ko lagata he ki gadakari unke or pradhanmantri pad ke bich roda ban sakate hai
 This is the reason why Modi wants to remove Gadkari from the post of party president and for this he is resorting to Ram Jethmalani
 blog main vaidya ne bijepi ke saansad ram jethmalani ke saarvajanik rup se gadakari ke khilaaf bayaanbaji karne par bhi naaraazgi jataai he
 According to him, if Jethmalani had any complaint with Gadkari, he could have spoken on the party platform
 iske liye baahar jaakar bayaanbazi karne kii kya zarurat he
 The comments bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne is masale par ek bayaan jari kiya he
 It says that my attention has been drawn to the Marathi blog of senior journalist MG Vaidya
 is blog kaa saar media ke ek varg main bhi prakashit kiya gaya he
 The author has recently tried to relate the remarks of a party MP to Narendra Modi
 bijepi aisi kisi bhi koshish ko puri tarah khaarij karti he, kyonki iskaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 All the central leaders and chief ministers of the party are working fully together for the party
 ham gujarat vidhansabha chunaav puure aapasi vishwaas or ekta ke saath lard rahe hai
 BJP stands firmly united with Narendra Modi and we are confident that BJP will get a grand victory in the coming assembly elections
 vaidya kaa yah bhi kahana he ki agar ram jethmalani ko koi shikaayat he to vah unhen party ke bheetar rakhni chahie na ki saarvajanik kerani chahie
 Vaidya does not stop here, he says that the BJP should not announce its prime ministerial candidate right now
 vahiin sangh ne vaidya ke is bayaan par kaha he ki yah unki nijee raay he sangh kii nahin
 MG Vaidya has advised Jaswant Singh Yashwant Sinha and Shatrughan Sinha to resign from the party like Mahesh Jethmalani if he is so angry

 This time, the methods of campaigning in Bihar elections are quite different
 bijepi to 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main hi prachaar ke abhinav prayogon se chaunkaa chuki he, lekin vidhansabha chunaav main mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhi usee raah chal pade hai
 His front-run common front has created a high-tech campaign strategy
 gaur karen to paaenge ki nitish kaa prachaar kuch-kuch vaisaa hi he, jaisaa 2014 loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle narendra modi kaa tha
 The reason for this is Prashant Kishore
 prashanth kishor ne hi loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ke prachaar kii kaman sanbhali thi
 The idea of 'chai Ke Charcha' and '3D Hologram' was a product of his team
 lekin haryana or maharashtra ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi ne prashanth kishor kaa istemaal nahin kiya
 The same Prashant is now commanding the promotion of Nitish in Bihar
 dekhte hai ki 2014 main modi ke or 2015 main nitish ke chunaav prachaar main kisi samanthaayen hai:1
 How much the voters of the political party on Twitter will be affected by Twitter will be a matter of debate, but Prashant Kishore has also played this bet
 nitish twitor par sakriyata se utar aae hai
 He is the first Chief Minister of Bihar to campaign by calling a question-and-answer session on this micro-blogging website
 beete dinon twitor par # asknitish hashtag ke jariye logon ne unase sawaal puche or mukhyamantri ne jawaab die
 At the same time, she became 'bhujang Controversy'
 2014 main narendra modi ke chunaav prachaar kaa ahm tul twitor tha
 The team of Modi supporters worked throughout the day to keep their hashtags on Twitter's top trend
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad bhi modi twitor ko badi takat maanate hai or vahaan khaase sakriy hai
 2
 naare bhi kamobesh ek jaisemodi kaa 'abaki baar, modi sarkaar' kaa naaraa superhit sabit hua tha or ise behtareen locasampark kii misaal ke taur par yaad kiya jaataa he
 Prashant Kishore has created a similar catchy and tongue-slogan for Nitish
 yah he, 'phir se ek baar ho, bihar main bahaar ho, phir se ek baar ho, neetishae kumaar ho
 "nitishe" also has a sense of regionalism
 is geet ko mobile phone tak pahunchane ke makasad se isaki ringtone bhi relies kii gai he
 It is being used during Nitish's campaign 'har Ghar Dastak'
 nitish samarthak naaron main waisi samayikta bhi najar aa rahi he, jaisi bijepi istemaal karti rahi he
 It is not uncommon that the slogan came right after Modi's Muzaffarpur rally, "don't come in a jiggle, you will win Nitish
" '3
 Nitish's discussion on the 'paper-door-to-door' campaign is not a new way, but in 2014 the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party used it in a big way
 'ghar ghar modi, har har modi' kaa naaraa varanasi se uchhla or dilli tak chaaya rahaa
 This time JDU workers are also going door-to-door with handheld leaflets
 30 din main party ke 10 lakh kaaryakartaaon ne 1 karod gharon par dastak dekar 3 karod logon se sampark karne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 Discussion on the form is also being conducted by JDU
 iskaa makasad party ke parchon ke aadhaar par matadaataaon se charchaa karnaa he taaki ardh-shahari or gramin matadaataaon ke saath sidhaa naata joda ja sake
 This method of campaigning also seems clearly inspired by Modi's discussion on the highly successful tea
 maje kii baat he ki vah tarika bhi prashanth kishor ke dimag kii upaj tha
 4
 judane ke liye kol karembijapi ne missd kol campan chalaaya tha
 Nitish Kumar has also released a number
 vigyaapan is tarah he- 'hamase judane ke liye kol karen
 9006290062'5
 10 saal baad kaa vijananitish kumaar fasebuk or twitor par The Bihar@2025 campan launch karne vaale hai
 Under this, the achievements of the government in the last 10 years will be recorded, questions will be answered and suggestions will be invited
 janata tak pahunchane kaa yah tarika modi style kii yaad dilaataa he
 Modi also used to talk about India's future after 10 and 20 years in his speeches
 nitish kumaar apane samarthakon or media se naashte kii baithki bhi karnaa shuru karenge
 6
 modi sarkaar par tathyon ke saath varmodi ne upie ke samay ke bhrashtachar or girti arthvyavastha or vikaas ke sapane ko mudda banaaya tha
 Team Nitish has prepared a very logical strategy for criticizing Modi
 vah hawaii fire or badjubaani karne ke bajaae kaagajon par baat kar rahe hai
 The Modi government is being attacked in relation to the unfinished promises made out of their tongues
 masalan kaale dhan kii vaapasi or sabake acount main 15-20 lakh rupee aane kaa vaada, emspi par yutern, 2022 main sabko ghar dene ke sapane par ab tak koi yojana-sansaadhan nahin, bihar ke liye vishesh rajya ke darje kaa vaada aadi

 Movie Review Bioscopewala: kahani vahi,packaging nayi, danni kaa jabardast andaajakahaani:film kii kahani chambal ke bihadon se shuru hoti he, jahaan ek shaadi ke dauraan dabang shambhu (jaiki shroff) ke haathon ek dulhan ko goli lag jaati he
 After this he has to go to jail
 iske baad usee giroh kaa sadsy kadak singh (ke ke minan) bahubali ban jaataa he
 Also, the minister of the same area is Ram Vijay Tripathi (pankaj Tripathi) who is known for his obscene antics
 ek baar ram vijay treepathi kii najar vahaan kii teacher roji (maahi gil) par padati he
 The teacher dies due to coercion, due to which he has to go to jail
 kahani main radhe (jimi shergill ) kii entry hoti he jiskaa ek ehsaan kadak singh ke upar hota he or us ehsaan ke chalate kadak singh, radhe or uski patni lalli (shriya saran ) kaa khyaal rakhane kaa vachan detaa he, lekin jab ram vijay treepathi jail se chhootakar waapas aata he to kai sari ghatnaayen ghatati hai or antat ek rigelt aata he, jise jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Movie Review Parmanu: The film creates pride for the country, the best acting is a weak link: The story of the film looks quite clichéd and the way its treatment is even weaker
 itane achche-achche kalakaaron kii maujuudagi ke baad bhi film main wo baat nahin he
 Makers have been unable to cash in on these stars
 kaaphi hili duli si editing he
 The sync sound also does not match the dialogues in many places
 behad kaa zikr hota he, lekin film main behad ke kuch chuninda shots hi hai, baaki puri tarah se alag hi kahani he 
 The screenplay of the film is also weak as well as the music has not become popular
 kyon dekhen film:film main pankaj treepathi kaa kaam jabardast he
 Along with that, KK Manon, Jimmy Shergill, Shriya Saran, Deepraj Rana and Mahi Gill have also done a good job in special appearances
 film ke samvaad bhi kai kai jagahon par aapako hansaate hai
 REVIEW: Funny is Deadpool 2, Ryan Reynolds' acting Strong Box Office: The film's budget is low and it is unlikely to be successful at the box office as movies like 'raazi' and 'atomic' are already doing well at the box office
 And with this, 'veere Di Wedding' and 'bhavesh Joshi Superhero' films are being released right now

 puri disple par fingerprint scinar yuj karne kaa anubhav shandaar he
 Finger scan in any part of the display can unlock the phone
 yujar interphes aam vivo smartphone kii tarah hi, settings me kai badlaav hai or kuch eps die gaye hai
 We played audio on it and the quality was very good
 bina spikar gril ke audio sunanaa bhi ek alag tareeke kaa anubhav he
 Charging is easy, there is a magnetic connector and it is also easy to connect the charger
 haalanki magnetic conector charger main stream nahin he, isliye company ko isamen wireles charging dene ke bare main sochna chahie
 You can also transfer data with a charging cable
 said main die gaye wolum rocker or lock sensor bhi thik thaak kaam karte hai
 Since it is still a concept, there are problems in using it many times
 thik vaise hi phul disple fingerprint scinar bhi kabhi kabhi responsive nahin hota he
 Lack of SIM card tray is a big problem, because at present, the trend of e SIM is at least in the Indian market
 haalanki jeeyo or airtel jaisi companiyaan i-sim detii hai
 But it still seems unreal
 phone ke spacifications top ke hai, to kuch samay ke yuj par isamen koi lag notice nahin hua or phone smood kaam karata he
 Will this be the truth? Overall, this smartphone is futuristic, the company has transformed the imaginary into reality
 dekhnaa hoga company ise asal main launch jab karegi to isamen kitne badlaav hote hai
 There is no doubt that this phone will make a lot of headlines, but whether or not this phone will become a mainstream, it cannot be said right now
 haalanki ol disple fingerprint scinar or screen audio feechar vaali technolji ko yuj karnaa kisi duusari company ke liye bhi behatar ho saktaa he
 Just like now companies are launching smartphones with under display fingerprint scanners
 vivo hi wo company he jisane sabase pehle ye technolji vaala smartphone launch kiya tha
 One step ahead in technology
 
 Vivo Apex 2019 Concept - is a futuristic smartphone and can become a trend setter
 lekin company ko is par kaaphi kaam karne kii jarurat he

 Party General Secretary Satish Mishra said, 'it is shameful to make a statement like Chief Minister leaving his opponents to leave the state for criticizing bigamy law and order at all levels in the state and if he does not tolerate the truth then he (akhilesh) will hold his post in public interest

 Referring to several development works from medical colleges and engineering institutes built in BSP Raj to Yamuna Expressway, he said that the Samajwadi Party government has started such a wrong tradition by changing the name of the institutions named after Dalit heroes under the illusion

 The Lokpal may not have come, but many people came to power by coming out of the movement that led to its arrival
 2011 se 13 ke saal main aisa lagata tha ki lokapal nahin aayega to qayaamat aa jaaegi
 Lokpal became law in 2013
 1968 main pehali baar loksabhaa main pesh hua tha
 If it took 45 years to enact the law, it should have taken at least ten to twenty years to be appointed after the law was enacted
 abhi to lokapal kanoon ke bane chaar hi saal hue hai, abhi to 41 saal or baaki hai, magar log itani jaldi bhul gaye ki bhrashtachar agar dur hoga to lokapal se hi dur hoga balki log itnaa bhul gaye ki yaad hi nahin rahaa ki lokapal andolan se nikali do-do partiyon ko dilli nagar nigam ke chunaavon main vot bhi dena he
 The guitarist singing the lokpal-lokpal is very much missing, his song was very good
 bhartiya janata party ne 2014 ke ghoshnaa patr ke pej number 9 par likhaa tha, 'prashasnic sudhaar bhaajapa ke liye praathamikta honge, iske liye ham unka kriyanvayan pradhanmantri karyaalay ke tahat ek uchit sanstha ke zariye karne kaa prastaav karte hai, ham ek prabhavi lokapal sanstha gathit karenge, har str ke bhrashtachar se tivrata or kadai se nipta jayega
 ' kya aapane in teen varshon main prabhavi lokapal kii sanstha gathit hote hue dekhi he
 It is being claimed to remove corruption without the Lokpal, if people are writing a letter to the Prime Minister about the complaints of corruption, then they also copy us
 agar lokapal hota to bhrashtachar kii sari shikaayatein vahaan jaatin or un par karrwai hoti
 Without the Lokpal, a daily certificate is issued that there is no allegation of corruption
 lokapal ko sarkaar itnaa bhul gai ki yaad dilaane ke liye gaiyr sarkari sanstha kaaman coz ko supreme court main yachika daayar kerani padi
 On 27 April, the Supreme Court dismissed every plea of the government
 supreme court ne saafe kah diya he ki centre sarkaar bina netaa vipaksh ke hi lokapal kii niyukti kii prakriya puri kare
 There is no justification for holding the appointment of Lokpal due to lack of Leader Opposition
 lokapal act par bina sanshodhan ke hi kaam kiya ja saktaa he
 The central government argued that the Lokpal cannot be appointed without amending the law
 28 march ko bhi bahes hui thi, court main bharat sarkaar ke atorni general mukul rohtagi ne kaha tha ki vartmaan halaat main lokapal kii niyukti sambhav nahin he
 What are these current conditions? sarkaar kii mukhya daleel rahi he ki vipaksh kaa netaa nahin he or bees ke kareeb sanshodhan karne hai jo sansad main lambit he
 In the last three years, one difficult law has been passed, the law which was not allowed to be passed by all political parties, then passed together so that the public does not feel that there is no corruption, then that law has a slight Why the amendment could not take place
 28 march ko supreme court main sarkaar ne apana paksh rakhaa tha ki nyaaypalika ko adhikaron ke bantwaare kaa sammaan karnaa chahie or sansad ko ye nirdesh jari nahin karne chahie ki vah lokapal kii niyukti kare
 But on April 27, the Supreme Court clearly stated that no excuse will be allowed for the appointment of Lokpal
 lokapal bill main 2014 main sanshodhan prastaav laayaa gaya tha lekin standing cameti ne ek saal kaa vakt le liya
 The Attorney General said that the Parliamentary Committee recommended an integrated framework for anti-corruption institutions
 report main kendriya satarkta ayog, sibiai kii anti karpshan beuro ko lokapal ke saath ekikrut karne kii sifarish kii gai he
 Overall, all the arguments of the government not to appoint Lokpal, could not stand in court
 to kya ab wo din aa gaya he jab lokapal niyukt ho sakegaa
 This institution will do its job and citizens will be able to make complaints of corruption from an autonomous body
 13 april ke indian express main ek report chhapi thi
 The Central Vigilance Commission CVC, which monitors corruption in central institutions, submitted a report in Parliament
 iske anusaar centre sarkaar ke vibhinn vibhaagon ke karmchaariyon ke kilaaf bhrashtachar kii shikayaton main 67 pratishat kaa oochaal aayaa he

 There have been 6,513 complaints against Home Ministry employees
 bank karmchaariyon ke kilaaf 6,018 shikaayatein ain hai
 There have been 2,496 complaints against the employees of the Ministry of Petroleum
 raksha mantralay ke karmchaariyon ke kilaaf 689 shikaayatein ain hai
 This is the report of the Central Vigilance Commission
 jabaki sarkaar ke bhrashtachar mukt hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa rahaa he
 If there was an ombudsman, the corruption claims could be independently confirmed
 sansad main pesh hui kendriya satarkta ayog kii report ke anusaar bhrashtachar kii shikayaton main ek saal ke bheetar bhanyakar oochaal aayaa he
 In 2015, 29,838 complaints were filed
 2016 main 49,847 shikaayatein darj hui hai
 There was a jump of 67 per cent in a year
 yahi nahin, sivisi ko tamaam rajya sarkaron or anya sanghathanon ke afasaron karmchaariyon ke khilaaf bhi bade paimaane par shikaayatein mili hai, isamen bhi 50 percent kaa oochaal aayaa he
 These complaints have also been resolved
 railway ke karmchaariyon ke kilaaf 11,200 shikaayatein mili thim jinamein se 8,852 kaa nipataara kar diya gaya
 But 1,054 complaints have been pending against the employees for six months
 is report ke anusaar rashtriya rajdhani kshetra dilli ke karmchaariyon ke kilaaf bhrashtachar kii shikayaton main kami ai he
 There were 5,139 complaints filed in 2015, down to 969 in 2016
 tippaniyan There is a report by Chetan Chauhan in Hindustan Times of 26 April
 iske anusaar sarkaar soochna ke adhikaar kanoon main nayaa badlaav laane ja rahi he
 The government has given an affidavit during the hearing in the Delhi High Court
 iske anusaar apil ko waapas liya ja sakegaa
 Whose rights activists say that the whistle blower, which exposes corruption, could endanger its life
 log ujagar karne par tarah tarah ke dabaav daal kar apil waapas kara lenge
 Not only this, a provision was also being given that the application would be deemed canceled after the death of the applicant
 kaaryakarta sarkaar se maang kar rahe hai wo aisa na kare
 According to one figure, 65 people who filed rtis have been killed and 400 people have been attacked since 2005
 hindustan times kii report main sarkaar kaa paksh yah bataaya gaya he ki yah sanshodhan nayaa nahin he balki upie ne 2012 main laane kaa prayaas kiya tha, vahi he
 No new changes are proposed
 2014 main sarkaar main aane ke baad pradhanmantri modi or anya mantriyon kaa daawa rahaa he ki pehle hi din supreme court ke aadesh ke tahat kaale dhan kaa pataa lagane ke liye esaiti kaa gathan kar diya gaya he
 a statement by SIT deputy chairman Justice Arijit Pasayat has appeared in the Hindu newspaper of 3 March that 70,000 crore black money has been detected so far, including 16,000 crore abroad
 notebandi se kitne hazaar karod kaala dhan kaa pataa chalaa he isaki aupchaarik soochna nahin ai he, esaiti kaa jo pataa chalaa he wo notebandi main samaapt ho gaya yaa nahin, isaki bhi aupchaarik soochna nahin he
 Then Justice Pasayat said that the SIT had suggested to the government that if the transactions in cash of more than three lakhs were declared illegal, the government agreed but instead the government has now reduced it to two lakhs
 kitne logon ko pataa he ki wo esaiti kaa nek suzav tha
 However, the institution of eliminating corruption is not just the Lokpal
 sabake apane apane daawey hai
 Have you seen the institution of effective Lokpal in these three years? bagair lokapal ke hi bhrashtachar dur karne kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he, log bhrashtachar kii shikayaton ko lekar kabhi pradhanmantri ko patr likh rahe hai to hamen bhi copy kar dete hai
 If Lokpal was there, all the complaints of corruption would have gone there and action would have been taken
 bagair lokapal ke rozaana certificate jari hota he ki karpshan kaa koi aarope nahin laga he
 The government forgot the Lokpal so much that Common Cause had to file a petition in the Supreme Court to remind it
 27 april ko supreme court ne sarkaar kii har daleel ko kaarij kar diya
 The Supreme Court has clearly stated that the Central Government should complete the process of appointment of Lokpal without the Leader of the Opposition
 netaa vipaksh ke na hone kii vajah se lokapal kii niyukti roke rakhane kaa koi auchity nahin he
 The Lokpal Act can only be acted upon without modification
 centre sarkaar kii daleel thi ki kanoon main sanshodhan bina lokapal kii niyukti nahin ho sakati
 The debate was also held on March 28, in the court of the Attorney General of the Government of India, Mukul Rohatgi said that the appointment of Lokpal is not possible under the present circumstances
 ye vartmaan halaat kya hai
 The government's main argument has been that there is no Leader of the Opposition and close to twenty amendments are pending in Parliament
 pichley teen saal main ek se ek mushkil kanoon paas hue hai, jis kanoon ko sabhi raajnneetik dalon ne pehle paas nahin hone diya, phir milakar paas kiya taaki janata ko yah na lage ki koi bhrashtachar ke kilaaf nahin he to us kanoon main ek maamuli sa sanshodhan kyon nahin ho sakaa
 On 28 March, the government submitted its stand in the Supreme Court that the judiciary should respect the sharing of rights and Parliament should not issue instructions to appoint the Lokpal
 magar 27 april ko supreme court ne saaf saaf kah diya ki lokapal kii niyukti ke liye koi bahaanaa nahin chalegaa
 The Lokpal Bill was amended in 2014, but the Standing Committee took a year
 atorni general ne kaha ki sansadeey samiti ne bhrashtachar nirodhak sansthaaon ke liye ekikrut dhaanche kii sifarish kii he
 The report recommends the Central Vigilance Commission, cbi's Anti Corruption Bureau be integrated with the Lokpal
 kul milakar lokapal niyukt na karne ke jitne bhi tark sarkaar ke the, adaalat main nahin tik sake
 So has the day now come when Lokpal will be appointed
 yah sanstha apana kaam karegi or naagarik bhrashtachar kii shikaayatein ek swytt sanstha se kar sakenge
 a report was published in the Indian Express on 13 April
 kendriya sansthaaon main bhrashtachar par nigaraanee rakhane vaali sanstha kendriya satarkta ayog sivisi ne sansad main ek report saunpi

 agar lokapal hota to bhrashtachar ke daavon ke bare main swatantra rup se pushti ho sakati thi
 According to the report of the Central Vigilance Commission tabled in Parliament, complaints of corruption have skyrocketed within a year
 2015 main 29,838 shikaayatein darj hui thim

 According to this report, complaints of corruption have come down against the employees of National Capital Territory of Delhi

 According to this, the government is going to bring a new change in the Right to Information Act
 dilli hai court main sunwaayee ke dauraan sarkaar ne halafanama diya he
 Accordingly, the appeal can be withdrawn
 jise soochna ke adhikaar kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki isse jo visal blor he yani jo bhrashtachar ko ujagar karata he, uski jaan khatare main pad sakati he
 People will put pressure on exposing them and return the appeal
 yahi nahin, ek praavdhaan yah bhi bataaya ja rahaa tha ki aavedak kii maut ke baad aavedan nirast mana jayega
 The workers are demanding from the government that they should not do so
 ek aankade ke mutabik 2005 se ab tak artiai daayar karne vaale 65 logon kii hatya ho chuki he or 400 logon par hamale ho chuke hai
 The Hindustan Times report points out that the government's stand is that this amendment is not new but it is the same that UPA tried to bring in 2012
 koi nayaa badlaav prastaavit nahin he
 After coming to the government in 2014, Prime Minister Modi and other ministers have claimed that the SIT has been formed on the very first day to find out the black money under the order of the Supreme Court
 3 march ke hindu akhbaar main esaiti ke dipti chairman justise arijit pasaayat kaa ek bayaan chapa he ki ab tak 70,000 karod kaala dhan kaa pataa chalaa he jisamen 16,000 karod videshon main he
 There is no formal notice of how many thousand crores of black money has been detected by demonetisation, whether the SIT has found out that it has ended in demonetisation or not
 tab justise pasaayat ne bataaya ki esaiti ne sarkaar ko suzav diya tha ki teen lakh se zyada ke cash main lenden ko avaidh ghoshit kar diya jaae to sarkaar ne maan liya balki sarkaar ne ise ab do lakh kar diya he
 How many people know that this was a good suggestion of SIT

 aapako dharmik granth mahabharat se judi alag-alag kai kahaniyon ke bare main maaloom hoga, lekin inamen kai aisi bhi kahaniyaan hai jinke bare main ap shaayad hi jaanate hon
 Know about 11 such stories related to the religious book Mahabharata: 1
 jab kauravon kii sena pandavon se yuddh haar rahi thi tab duryodhana bhishma pitamah ke paas gaya or unhen kehane laga ki aap apni puri shakti se yah yuddh nahin lard rahe hai
 Bhishma Pitamah got very angry and immediately took five gold arrows and recited some mantras
 mantra padhane ke baad unhone duryodhana se kaha ki kal in paanch tiron se ve pandavon ko maar denge
 But Duryodhana could not believe Bhishma Pitamah and took arrows and said that he would return these arrows tomorrow morning
 in tiron ke peeche kii kahani bhi bahut mjedaar he
 When Lord Krishna came to know about the arrows, he called Arjuna and said that you go to Duryodhana and ask for five arrows
 duryodhana kii jaan tumne ek baar gandharva se bachaai thi
 Instead, he said that ask for one thing to save his life
 samay aa gaya he ki abhi tum un paanch sone ke tir maang lo
 Arjuna went to Duryodhana and asked for arrows
 kshatriya hone ke naate duryodhana ne apane vachan ko puraa kiya or tir arjuna ko de die

 uski sundarataa ko dekh rishi mantra mugdh ho gaye or unke sharir se shukranu niklaa jise rishi ne ek mitti ke bartan main jamaa karke andhere main rakh diya

 arjuna ke bete iravan ne apane pita kii jeet ke liye khud kii bali di thi
 Before he sacrificed, he had a final wish to get married before he died
 magar is shaadi ke liye koi bhi ladki taiyaar nahin thi kyonki shaadi ke turant baad uske pati ko maranaa tha
 In this situation, Lord Krishna took the form of Mohini and not only married Iravan but wept as well as a wife
 6
 Sahadeva, who became intelligent by eating his father's brain
 usamen bhavishya dekhne kii kshamta thi isliye duryodhana uske paas gaya or yuddh shuru karne se pehle usase sahi muhoort ke bare main poocha

 udupi kaa raja na to pandav kii taraf se the or na hi kaurav kii taraf se
 The king of Udupi told Krishna that such a large army of Kauravas and Pandavas would need food and we would cook and feed the armies on both sides
 18 din tak chalane vaale is yuddh main kabhi bhi khaanaa kam nahin padaa
 When the army asked the king about this, he credited it to Krishna
 raja ne kaha ki jab krishna bhojan karte hai to unke aahaar se unhen pataa chal jaataa he ki kal kitne log marane vaale hai or khaanaa isi hisaab se banaaya jaataa he
 9
 jab duryodhana kurushetra ke yuddh kshetra main aakhri saans se le rahaa tha, us samay usne apni teen ungliyaan uthaa rakhi thi
 Lord Krishna went to him and understood that Duryodhana wanted to say that he would have won the war if he had not committed three mistakes in the war
 magar krishna ne duryodhana ko kaha ki agar tum kuch bhi kar lete tab bhi haar jate
 After hearing this, Duryodhana took his finger down
 10

 Karna was winning in this game when Bhanumati saw Duryodhana coming and tried to stand
 duryodhana ke aane ke bare main karn ko pataa nahin tha
 So as Bhanumati tried to get up, Karna wanted to catch him
 bhaanumati ke badale uske motiyon kii maala uske haath main aa gai or vah tut gai
 Duryodhana had arrived in the room by then
 duryodhana ko dekh kar bhaanumati or karn donon dar gaye ki duryodhana ko kahin kuch galat shaq naa ho jaae
 But Duryodhana had great faith in Karna
 usne sirf itnaa kaha ki motiyon ko uthaa len
 11
 karn daan karne ke liye kaaphi prasiddh tha
 When Karna was taking his last breath in the battle field, Lord Krishna wanted to test his charity
 ve garib brahman banakar karn ke paas gaye or kaha ki tumhaare bare main kaaphi suna he or tumse mujhe abhi kuch uphaar chahie
 Karna said in reply that you can ask for whatever you want
 brahman ne sona maanga
 Karna said that gold is in his teeth and you can take it
 brahman ne jawaab diya ki main itnaa kaayar nahin hum ki tumhaare daant todun
 Karna then picked up a stone and broke his teeth
 brahman ne ise bhi lene se inkaar karte hue kaha ki khun se sanaa hua yah sona vah nahin le saktaa
 Karna then picked up an arrow and walked towards the sky
 iske baad barish hone lagi or daant dhul gaya

 - input bhashaa se Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has written a letter to Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari
 unhone isamen likhaa he ki manaregaa kanoon se phayda nahin ho rahaa he or is par bahes honi chahie
 Hindi translation of Vasundhara Raje's letter: i am writing this letter to you with reference to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Project (scheme) Act, an important aspect of the governance system
 mudda yah he ki kyon rojgaar guarantee ek kanoon se hi milani chahie or kyon is rojgaar kii utpatti, balki guarantee, ek skim sunishchit nahin kar saktaa he
 There are hardly any advantages of this law, except that various types of institutions can get a chance of litigation through it
 ise rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee skim hona chahie yaa rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee kanoon, yah bahes or charchaa kaa vishay he
 In both the situations the scheme should have its focal points - long-term wealth and livelihood creation
 is ahm mudde ko dhyaan main rakhkar main nimnlikhit binduon kii ore aapkaa dhyaan aakarshith karnaa chaahati hum, jin par atyaavashyak rup se dhyaan dene kii jarurat he
 1
 vibhageeya kaamon ke jariye utpann hue rojgaar kii ginati naregaa main honi chahie, is aadhaar par ki keval sabase jaruratmand or nirdhan log hi kathin shaareerik shram kii talash main hote hai
 In urban and rural areas such works should be counted under 'employment provided to meet latent demand'
 isse saal main karyanvit karaae jane vaale kaaryon kii sankhya ke sandarbh main vibhageeya kshamta bhi badhegi
 2
 kaary kushalta or unnateekaran par kiye janevaale kharche kaa praavdhaan bhi naregaa main hona chahie
 In this way NREGA can be integrated with the National Rural Livelihoods Mission and both the schemes can benefit from each other
 3
 The 60:40 ratio of labor and material should be considered at the district level
 isse vibhinn kshetron main aavashyaktaa ke anuroop alag-alag kaaryon ko shuru kiya ja sakegaa
 4
 rajya rojgaar guarantee parishad ko puri aazaadee honi chahie ki vah sthaneey jaruraton ke anusaar kisi bhi kaary ko is skim main sammilit kar sake
 It is hoped that my suggestions above will be taken positively and the corrective work of giving a new format to the scheme will be started at the earliest

 They have not broken any morale

 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad will hold a 3-day sant sammelan from May 31 to June 2 in Haridwar on the Ram temple
 sutron kii maane to is sammelan main vishwa hindu parishad or sant samaaj sarkaar par dabaav banayega ki jis tarah se tamilnadu main jalikattu par kanoon banaaya gaya usee tarah centre sarkaar sansad main kanoon banaakar ram mandir banane kaa rasta saaf kare
 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad believes that till now the central government has been saying that it does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 lekin upi or uttarakhand main bijepi ko prachand bahumat mila iske baad 2018 main sarkaar ke paas rajyasabha main bhi bahumat ho jayega
 Therefore, the government will not face any problem in enacting law on Ram temple in Parliament
 sutron kii maane to vishwa hindu parishad ke netaaon or sant samaaj kaa maananaa he kiraam mandirpar donon pakshon ke bich aam sahmati nahin ban sakati or nyaayalay kaa aadesh aane main samay lag saktaa he
 It is now to see what action the Modi government takes on the Ram temple
 kyonki abhi tak sarkaar ke bade mantri or bijepi ke netaaon ne kai baar ye kaha ki rajyasabha main unke paas bahumat nahin he
 Therefore, a law cannot be made in Parliament on the Ram temple
 lekin paanch rajyon ke chunaav ke nateezon ke baad 2018 main rajyasabha main sarkaar ke bahumat kii samasya samaapt ho jaaegi

 Baba Ramdev asked Yechury that Yechury would be able to call the innocent people who were murdered under the rule of Communists, Christians and Mughals, violence and atrocities
 seetaram yechuri ne bayaan diya tha ki ramayana or mahabharat bhi ladaai or hinsa se bhari hui thim, lekin ek prachaarak ke taur aap sirf mahakavy ke taur par use bataate hai, uske baad bhi daawa karte hai ki hindu hinsak nahin he
 Yechury had cited the Ramayana and the Mahabharata and said that what is the logic of linking one religion with violence
 yechuri ke isi bayaan par unki aalochana ho rahi he
 Now yoga guru Baba Ramdev has also spoken openly against Yechury
 baba ramdev ne twit kar likhaa he ki communiston, isaayiyon va mughalon ne apane rajya vistaar ke liye nyaay va kanoon ke naam par 50 karod nirdosh logon kaa katl kiya, kya seetaram yechuri isko atyaachaar va hinsa kehane kaa saahas kar paaenge?communiston,isaayiyon va mughalon ne apane rajya vistaar ke liye nyaay va kanoon ke naam par 50 karod nirdosh logon kaa katl kiya,kya # sitaramyechuryisako atyaachaar va hinsa kehane kaa saahas kar paaenge?seetaram yechuri ke hindoodharm par vivaadit bayaanke virodh main aaj haridwar main 11 baje pressvartabhpiche

 yahaan tak ki angrej itihaaskaaron ne bhi aisa nahin likhaa he, lekin congress ne hindu aatankwaad kaa daag lagane kaa kaam kiya he
 In this episode, Sitaram Yechury has said that the battle of Ramayana and Mahabharata was full of violence
 aise main kisi ek dharm ko hinsa se jodne kaa kya tark he
 This statement of Yechury has now been retaliated by Baba Ramdev and reminds him of the communists and the murder of the Mughal era

 Targeting the Deputy Governor, Sisodia said that for how long did the files sent by the Delhi Aam Aadmi Party government remain stuck in the LG office? Sisodia alleged that the file of higher education loan in the Lieutenant Governor's office was hanging for more than 400 days
 vahiin, mohalla clinics kii file ko bhi 146 dinon tak latakaakar rakhaa gaya
 Sisodia said that on 14 March 2018, the file containing the door-step delivery scheme of ration was also sent to the Lieutenant Governor for approval, but the Lieutenant Governor has kept the file hanging, objecting to it

 With the banner, all the mlas came out of the house and went to the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the assembly premises and started shouting slogans
 vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki is mudde ko ab sadan se baahar sadak par janata ke bich le jaaya jayega or alji anil baijal kaa istipha maanga jayega

 According to him, he found the character of Kashibai quite interesting
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah ek stri charitra he or mere liye yah role karnaa ek alag anubhav tha

 pakistan ke sena pramukh general qamar javed bajva ko or teen saal ke liye seva vistaar de diya gaya he
 It is being said in media reports that this step has been taken in view of the current security situation in the area

 khan ne ek abhootpurv kadam ke tahat bajva ko rashtriya vikaas parishad kaa sadsy bhi manonith kiya tha
 The appointment of the Chief of Army Staff in Pakistan is the prerogative of the Prime Minister and his government
 yahaan sabase varisht sainya adhikari ko sena pramukh banane kii parampara kaa paalan nahin kiya jaataa
 Bajwa has been given extension of service at a time when relations between India and Pakistan are going through a bad phase due to the decision to remove Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 kashmir ke vishesh darje ko samaapt karne ke bharat ke faisle par pratikriya jaahir karte hue pakistan ne nayi dilli ke saath apane rajanyik sambandhon kaa darja kam karne kaa faisla kiya tha or bhartiya ucchayukta ko nishkasit kar diya tha
 With this, Pakistan also put a stop to its business relations with India

 Mamta said in an election meeting in Vardhman district that you saw how Congress and BJP joined hands to form Telangana
 ab ve bengal kaa vibhaajan karne ke liye kah rahi hai
 it's not so easy
 main marane ke liye taiyaar hum, lekin vibhaajan nahin hone duungi
 Emphasizing unity between the people of the plains and the hilly areas, the Chief Minister called for peace in Darjeeling
 unhone congress, bijepi or makapa par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki darjeeling ab muskaraa rahaa he
 Peace has been restored and some people do not like it
 bihar kii satta main saajhedaar rashtriya janata dal (argedy) supremeo lalu prasad yadav ke daaman par ek baar phir bhrashtachar ke daag padate dikh rahe hai
 This time Lalu's family also seems to be under investigation
 shuukravaar ko sibiai to shanivaar idi ne yadav parivaar kii sampattiyon par chhapemari kii
 After this, the BJP intensified the attack on Lalu and intensified the demand to remove Nitish from Lalu's sons' cabinet
 haalanki, siyaasi ganit par agar daalen to nitish ke liye abhi argedy se naata todna aasaan nahin dikhataa
 Allegations of corruption against the RJD supremo's family have also intensified that Nitish Kumar will break the alliance with Lalu Yadav
 haalanki in kuch vajahon par gaur karen to nitish-lalu ke sambandh-viched kii sambhaavna nahin dikhti

 bihar kii satta par pakad badhibihar ke satta sameekaran par najar daalen, to 224 sadasyeey vidhansabha main argedy 80 siton ke saath sabase badi party he
 While JDU has 71 seats, BJP has 58 seats in its account
 aise main congress kii 27 siton ko mila den, to bihar kii sattadhari mahagathbandhan kii 178 siten banati hai
 Nitish Kumar became CM of Kumar Behar despite being second in terms of seats here
 aise main nitish agar argedy ne naata tod bijepi se haath milaate hai, tab bhi vah 129 siton (71+58) ke saath bahumat kaa aankada paar kar satta main bane rahenge
 Nitish's hold on Bihar's power has become stronger after being surrounded by allegations
 aise main nitish shaayad hi lalu se gathbandhan tod bijepi ke paale main jaaen

 2019 tak wet and walchanithish elaan kar chuke hai ki 2019 main ve piem pad ke daavedaar nahin hai or congress ko 2019 ke liye apni ranneeti saaf kerani chahie
 However, his supporters consider him the most reliable face of the opposition
 yahaan gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki nitish abhi jahaan vipakshi gathbandhan ke ahm cheharaa hai or kai jaankaar unhen piem pad ke chehre ke rup main dekhte hai, vahiin bijepi se judane par pradhanmantri narendra modi ke aage unki haisiyat kaaphi bauni banakar rah jaaegi
 Even as the face of the opposition, Nitish does not see much potential in front of Modi in 2019
 isliye 2019 kii res se hatane kaa faisla nitish kaa acha faisla hi kaha jayega

 modi-shah raaj main bijepi se sameekaran mushkil2014 ke chunaav se pehle modi ko cheharaa banaae jane kaa nitish ne jis tarah se virodh karte hue endie se naata todaa tha, aise main unke liye waapas usee gathbandhan se judana aasaan nahin dikhataa
 The Congress is also weakened in the opposition and after advancing Rahul Gandhi, there is a lot of potential in the opposition for Nitish
 nitish iske liye abhi intjaar karenge

 bihar main vot kaa samikarnakendre main kisi badi bhoomika par najar gadaaye nitish kumaar ke liye aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main bihar main shandaar pradarshan karnaa hoga
 In such a situation, the vote equation for Nitish will also have to be practiced
 vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan lalu yadav ke saath kii vajah se unhen yadavon or muslimon ne badhachadhakar vot diya
 Where 16 in Bihar
 8% muslim voter hai, vahiin yadav votaron kii sankhya 14% ke kareeb baithti he
 Lalu Yadav ruled the power of Bihar for 15 years on the strength of this muslim-yadav equalization
 aise main nitish bhi jaanate hai ki bijepi se haath milaane kaa matlab is vot se haath dhone jaisaa hoga
 Chinmayananda has been investigating in the case related to SIT Chinmayananda admitted in KGMU for 20 days due to ill health, Special Investigation Team i

 haalanki esaiti ne abhi tak yah giraftaar nahin kii he
 Meanwhile, after the name of the FIR is filed, the family members of the victim girl are also constantly running for legal help and it is quite possible that a petition for anticipatory bail be made before the Allahabad High Court today

 adaalat yah tay karegi ki vah ab tak kii jaanch se santusht he yaa nahin

 It is said that the rescuer is much larger than the one who kills
 anantnag main amarnath yatra par gaye shraddhaluon par aatanki hamale ke dauraan logon ne aise hi ek bachaane vaale ko dekha
 Name is Salim Sheikh
 saleem us bas kaa driver he, jis par somvaar kii raat aatankwaadiyon ne hamalaa kiya tha lekin andhadhundh goliyon kii bauchhaar ke bich saleem ne apni jaan kii parvaah kiye bagair jis tarah se bas main baithe shraddhaluon kii jaan bachaane kii koshish kii, us par kisi ko bhi naaz ho saktaa he
 The terrorists who used to indiscriminately bombard the innocent devotees of Amarnath were also Muslims, but what is the meaning of Islam and Muslims, it came to know that the place of this terrorist attack came from Valsad, Gujarat, two thousand kilometers from Anantnag
 Because of another Muslim
 ye ek ittefaq hi tha ki haathon main bandook liye jo aatankwaadi hindu shraddhaluon kii bas par goliyaan chalaa rahe the, us bas ko chalaane vaala koi or nahin, balki ek musalmaan hi tha
 Name is Salim Sheikh
 is aatankwaadi hamale ke dauraan usne wo kaam kiya, jo kisi bhi insaan kaa ferj tha
 He himself did not care for his life and continued to drive his bus with all the courage and fervor amidst the barrage of bullets
 or to or hamale ke dauraan ek baar phir bas kaa tair pankchar ho gaya
 But Salim Sheikh did not stop the bus and ran his bus for about one and a half kilometers till she got out of the reach of the terrorists
 iske baad saleem ne apane ghar main telephone kar unhen apane salaamat hone kii khabar to di, saath hi ye bhi kaha ki wo haragiz televijan naa chalaaen, jisase ghar ke duusare logon or khaskar biimaar logon ko tension ho
 The wife said that he continued driving the bus with his head bowed and he removed the bus from the reach of the terrorists
 jammu-kashmir se dur gujarat ke valsad main hamale kii shikaar hui bas ke driver saleem ke ghar ek ajeeb sa maahaul he
 On the one hand, he is relieved and proud that his own Salim not only survived in this attack, but he also tried to save the lives of others by fleeing his bus
 lekin is hamale main jo log maare gaye, unke liye is parivaar ke dil main bhi ek ankahi tadap si he
 Perhaps then, her mother starts smiling to tell an account of Salim's bravery, but her throat is strangled and she starts crying
 maa ko bete par garvaudhar, saleem kii maa kii tarah aspataal ke bistar par padi ab bahut si maataaon or bahanon ke dil se bhi ab bas saleem ke liye duaen nikal rahi hai
 Indeed, if Salim had not shown his bravery at the time of the attack, the result of this act of terrorists would have been terrible elsewhere
 saleem ne kaha ki khuda ne mujhe wo takat di ki main rukuun nahin or bas chalaata rahun
 There was continuous firing so i did not stop, just kept driving
 kul 7 logon kii hui maughamarnath yatra ko gaye shraddhaluon par aatanki hamale main 7 shraddhaluon kii maut hui
 Militants opened fire on the bus at Betangu near Anantnag
 aatankiyon ne pehle police kii gaadi par goliyaan barasaai or phir bas par
 But the understanding of the bus driver Salim Sheikh saved the lives of 51 passengers
 driver saleem shaikh ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet karte hue puure kisse ko saajha kiya
 Salim told that around 8 on Monday night
 15 baje bike par savaar aatankiyon ne pehle police kii gaadi par goliyaan barasaai, phir bas par golibari karne lage
 Salim told that when the terrorists were firing, he bent down and started driving the bus
 unhone bataaya ki us sthaan se kareeb 2 kilometre kii duuri par hi army camp tha, unhone sidhaa vahaan jaakar hi bas ko roka
 Bodies reached Surat Surat The bodies of the devotees killed in the terrorist attack during the Amarnath Yatra have reached Surat city of Gujarat
 vaayu sena kaa vimaan in shavon ko lekar pahunchaa
 Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has announced Rs 10 lakh for all the dead
 aapako bataa den ki aatanki hamale main gujarat ke 5 log maare gaye the
 CM Vijay Rupani also spoke to all the injured
 gujarat ke kul 17 yatri ghayal hue the, sabhi ko surat ke aspataal main bhartee kiya jayega

 But now many things have changed due to the arrival of new brands and now even big budget tvs are available in the market
 1,000 rupee prati-inch kii jo seemaa thi vah bhi ab tut chuki he, ab graahak 20,000 rupee se kam main adhik chizon kii ummid kar sakate hai

 smartphone segment ke baad Xiaomi ne pichley saal tivi segment main kadam rakhaa tha
 Xiaomi's first product was a 55-inch 4K Mi TV 4, but after that Xiaomi launched several affordable tvs in the market
 shaomi brands ke bharat main ab kul saat tivi uplabdh hai jinamein 32-inch kaa Mi TV 4C Pro sabase kifayati vikalp he
 The price of this TV in India is Rs
 12,999
 32 inch kaa Xiaomi Mi TV 4C Pro main HD rizolution (1366x768 picksal) elidi panel he jo 60 hertz rifresh rate ke saath aata he, saath hi isamen deaties echdi tuning ke saath 10 wat ke do spikar bhi hai
 It is a smart TV, remote has a microphone and is equipped with Google voice search feature
 Mi TV 4A (32) beshak isse kifayati he lekin ham is tivi kii salaah dete hai kyonki yah nae wais aneble remote or behatar sound ke saath aata he
 But the price of the Mi TV 4C Pro (32-inch) model is almost the same as the Mi TV 4A Pro (32)
 yah tivi hamaari pehali pasand he kyonki is keemat main yah kai fitures se las he
 This smart TV has a good panel, not only that, its price is also lower than other non-smart tvs
 packwal oes se las is tivi ke saath yuzar content ko aasaani se stream kar sakenge
 Additionally, it has Google service built-in such as Chromecast, youtube and Google Play for casting video and audio
 google play kii madad se aap atirikt eps or anya sarvice ko apane tivi ke liye downlod kar sakate hai
 Xiaomi Mi TV 4C Pro is the most economical option for users wanting to watch online content
 tivi main kai fitures hai to aise main graahakon ko alag se strimming divaais kharidne kii bhi aavashyaktaa nahin ho sakati he
 The TCL range in India is probably the most exciting when it comes to specification
 TCL 40S62FS tivi badhiya spacification se las he
 Priced below Rs 20,000, this TV comes with a 40-inch full-hd resolution display panel that gives customers such features as smart connectivity, stereo speakers, Dolby audio and screen mirroring with a larger display
 yuzar online content aasaani se dekh paaen isliye is tivi main Netflix or youtube pehle se hi bilt-in hai
 TCL also has tvs with Android interfaces but they cost a bit more
 company kaa TCL 40S6500 thodaa mahangaa he lekin yah android tivi he lekin is vishesh model main TCL launture diya gaya he
 However, what is worth noting in this price is its panel resolution and size
 panel sharp he or moshan bhi kabhi-kabhi smooth nahin he
 If you watch online streaming, cable or DTH the most, then TCL 40S62FS can prove to be a good option for you at this price
 upar bataae gaye jin do tivi kii hamane salaah di vah keemat ke anusaar achche tivi hai or unhen keval online hi kharida ja saktaa he
 But if you want to go to the nearest TV showroom and watch it before buying the TV, then we have an option for you

 Apart from this, this TV comes with Indian Cinema Mode
 yah 20,000 rupee se kam main ek acha vikalp he
 Also, before buying a TV, you can also go to the TV retailer and watch it
 haalanki ye sabhi tivi hamaare in-depth rivyuu prakriya se nahin guzare hai
 We have experienced these on the basis of price and specification to keep our list low
 bajet segment main aane vaale tivi kii is list ko hamane spacification, feechar, saise aadi kai chizon ko dhyaan main rakhkar taiyaar kiya he
 Although there is at least one 4K TV available around this price, but our experience with it was not very good
 iskaa matlab is keemat main aapako 32 inch ke tivi hi milenge jo fitures se las honge
 LED-LCD tvs are available in this price segment only
 hamane online keemat evam companiyon kii aadhikarik website par listing se apni is list ko chota kar paaen hai
 Our list includes those tvs which are easily found online, but at the same time we have included those tvs which can also be found in retail stores
 kya is keemat par smart tivi lenaa sahi he The addition of smart connectivity features increases the cost of any TV
 duusari ore agar aap chahen to non-smart tivi kharid sakate hai jo kifayati hoga, aap chahen to strimming divaais ko kharid sakate hai
 However, if you prefer to watch only cable or DTH content, then buying a smart TV will not be right for you
 aap kifayati non-smart tivi kharid sakate hai jo saise, rizolution or panel kii gunvattta par adhik dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 It is a sub-brand of TCL
 is tivi ke bare main dilachasp baat yah he ki yah TCL 40S62FS jaise samaan spacification or fitures ke saath aata he or isaki keemat 16,999 rupee he
 On paper, this is a great option
 viyu brands kaa yah tivi un logon ke liye badhiya or kifayati vikalp he jo badi screen vaale tivi kii talash main hai
 The price of this TV in the Indian market is Rs 17,999
 yah tivi 43 inch phul-echdi rizolution disple ke saath aata he or isamen 20wat sound output he

 This TV of the Cloudwalker brand is equipped with the best specification for less than Rs 20,000
 german brands Blaupunkt aamtaur par car audio system or upkarnon ke liye janaa jaataa he, lekin pichley saal company tivi kaarobaar main utari he

 12,999

 ek taraf duniya bhar main aatankwaad kaa doosraa naam ban chukaa pakistan he or duusari taraf america ko yuddh kii dhamkee dene vaala north korea he, jise america raashtrapati donald trump ne aatankwaad kaa praayojak desh ghoshit kar diya he
 On Monday, Donald Trump, wearing the title of Terror Sponsor of North Korea, announced that now more massive economic sanctions will be imposed on North Korea
 north korea par aatank kaa praayojak desh hone kaa tag lagane ke peeche donald trump ne jo vajah bataai hai
 The main reason among them is that apart from threatening nuclear destruction to the world, North Korea has repeatedly supported international terrorism
 north koreavideshi dharti par hatyaein karwaane kii sajishon main bhi shaamil rahaa he
 Despite repeated calls from the US, the government of North Korea is not stopping its nuclear program
 north korea ko aatanki desh ghoshit karne ke trump kaa faisle swaagat yogya he, lekin sawaal ye he ki trump kii najar main agar north korea aatanki desh he to aatank kaa khalipha ban chuke pakistan ko discount kyon diya ja rahaa he?north korea to sirf dhamkee detaa he lekin pakistan to bharat samet duniya bhar main aatanki hamale karwaane ke liye badnaam he to aakhir wo koun si majaburiyaan hai jinke vasheebhoot hokardonald trumpapakistan ko aatanki desh sabit nahin kar rahe hai
 North Korea became a threat to America When North Korea started dancing on the head of America and instead of fearing the threats of America, instead of threatening America, Donald Trump got North Korea to be a terrorist
 america kii najar main nau saal pehle tak bhi north korea aatankwaad kaa praayojak desh hua karata tha
 But then the tag was removed from it
 jis tarah north korea ne america tak maar karne vaali belastic missile kaa test kiya or parmaanu mixilon ke kaamyaab pareekshan kiye, usase wo ek baar phir america ke liye khatra ban gaya he
 Trump has also expressed this danger
 hona to ye chahie tha kidonald trump, north korea ke saath-saath pakistan ko bhi aatankwaad kaa praayojak desh ghoshit kar dete, kyonki agar trump ye maanate hai ki north korea ke parmaanu hathiyaar puri duniya ke liye khatra hai to unhen ye bhi pataa hoga ki use parmaanu bam banane kii takanic dene vaala pakistan hi tha
 While declaring North Korea as a terrorist country, why did Trump ignore that North Korea only supports terrorism, while Pakistan carries out terrorist attacks in India
 trump ke mutabik agar north korea videshi dharti par hatyakandon ko anjaam dene main shaamil he to wo ye kyon bhul rahe hai ki is kaam main to pakistan north korea kaa bhi baap he
 America's misconception seems that terrorism does not matter for Donald Trump, the only thing that matters is that the whole world is scared and respected by America
 jaisaa ki north korea bilkul nahin kar rahaa, isliye wo aatankwaadi desh he or pakistan ne america ke dabaav main ek america family ko paanch saal baad hakkaani network ke changul se kya chhudaa liya
 Donald Trump got the misconception that he had tightened up Pakistan's nut bolts
 pakistan se pyaar or north korea se nafrat, aatankwaad par america kii ye trump chaal he
 On one side is North Korea which has joined the list of terrorism sponsor countries like Iran, Sudan and Syria, it should have been with it
 lekin duusari taraf pakistan he, jo aatankwaad ke praayojak deshon kii list main number van hona chahie tha, lekin aatankwaad kii dohari niti ke chalate wo is list se baahar he
 The President of Donald Trump, who has been talking big about teaching Pakistan a lesson
 usee pakistan ke prati ab unka hday parivartan ho gaya he
 The truth is that trumps are putting only as much nostalgia in Pakistan's nose as Pakistan can not hurt America

 The charge sheet was filed in the Mumbai Fort Court
 malwani main isi saal june maheene main hue sharaab cond main kul 106 logon kii maut hui thi or 75 biimaar hue the
 It was alleged that liquor mafia had added more chemical in the greed to earn more profits, due to which liquor became poison
 lekin jab jaanch hui to pataa chalaa ki jise sharaab samaj kar logon ne piya tha wo sharaab nahin, balki sirf chemical tha yani methenol
 Mumbai Crime Branch investigating the case has arrested a total of 14 accused, while two accused are still absconding

 In this way, about 80 degrees of methanol would go from about 17 to 18 degrees
 isliye itane saal chemical ne ekadam se asar nahin kiya, lekin haadase kii raat yani 17 june ko lagata he ki methenol or pani kii maatra main gadabad ho gai or jehar ne apana kaam kar diya
 As a result, many houses were destroyed

 # navsarjangujarat vidhansabha main dharne par baithe bijepi ke kareeb 200 mlanamxa kishor gurjar ke samarthan main dharne par baithe vidhayakuttar pradesh kii vidhansabha main mangalvaar ko jo hua wo soobe kii raajnneeti kii ek aisi ghatana thi jise hameshaa yaad rakhaa jayega
 Remembering that the BJP government of Uttar Pradesh on the one hand was counting the achievements of the government in the assembly on the issue of corruption and security, on the other hand, BJP MLA Nand Kishore Gurjar was questioning his government as to why the police and administration Is being harassed on behalf of nand kishor gurjar gajiabad ke loni vidhansabha kshetra se vidhayak hai
 Nand Kishore could not raise his voice in the assembly, after which he sat on a dharna in the House itself and about 200 more BJP mlas also sat on the dharna in his support
 shaam 6 baje ke baad kisi tarah unhen nyaay kaa aashwaasan dekar vidhansabha se uthaaya gaya, lekin vidhansabha ke itihaas kii ye abhootpurv ghatana apane aap me bahut kuch bayaan kar gai
 Read: Yogi adityanath-keshav Maurya's tussle in UP government, what is the significance of the incident on corruption? This incident has serious significance
 lekin usapar najar daale isse pehle ye samajhnaa jaruri he ki aakhirkaar vidhayak nand kishor gurjar kii vyathaa kya he, jiske sahare kisi bade makasad kaa ye sara maahaul paidaa hua
 The MLA sat on the run and created uncomfortable conditions for the government
 yahaan sawaal ye nahin he ki sattapaksh ke ek vidhayak ne apni sarkaar main vyavastha par sawaal uthaa diya
 The question is further than that, why did it happen on such a large scale and what is the real meaning of it? According to the problem of Nand Kishore Gurjar, a food inspector in Loni area wrongly licensed the meat business to the wrong people
 
 unhone iske liye aawaaj uthaai
 It is alleged that the MLA beat up the food inspector
 isi aarope main vidhayak or unke samarthakon ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kara diya gaya
 The MLA complains that he has not been heard in this case and the administration has taken him on target
 nand kishor kaa aarope ye bhi he ki jab is bare main unhone vidhansabha main apni baat rakhane kii koshish kii to unhen bolne nahin diya gaya
 The mla's serious accusation, Nandan Kishore, says that the local authorities are completely engrossed in corruption and openly says that in the earlier SP-BSP governments, the commission of twenty-four percent was used in government work and now this commission has gone up to eighteen percent
 ye baat unhone buudhvaar ko sadan main bhi kahi
 These allegations of the MLA are also serious and blur the government's policy of 'zero tolerance' on corruption
 lekin baat yaheen nahin khatm hoti
 The matter went even further when about 200 BJP mlas sat on a dharna for not letting Nand Kishore Gurjar speak in the assembly
 ye behad gambhir ishaara he
 This raises many questions which may be the cause of uneasiness for Yogi Adityanath
 is maamle main vipaksh ko kisi badi yojana kii bu aa rahi he
 What do the leaders of the opposition Congress state president Ajay Kumar Lallu feel that this is the result of a tussle within the government
 bhrashtachar, mahilaon kii suraksha samet tamaam mahatvapurn muddon par yogi sarkaar fail hui he lihaaja unke netaa ab khulkar aawaaj uthaa rahe hai
 In such an environment, Ajay Kumar Lallu demanded the resignation of Yogi Adityanath on moral grounds
 netaa vipaksh or samaajawaadee party ke varisht netaa ram govind choudhary to isse aage kii baat kehete hai
 Calling the incident of 200 mlas sitting on a sit-in protest against the government historic, he said that these are the notes of revolt which clearly indicate that most of the BJP mlas do not want to see Yogi Adityanath as the Chief Minister
 unhone kaha ki kai vidhayak unke khilaaf dharne par baith gaye, matlab saaf he ki sarkaar alpamat me aa gai
 Ram Govind Chaudhary said that it is entirely a case of going one step further against Yogi Adityanath
 jiskaa asar aanevaale dinon main dekhne ko milegaa
 Whose planning to sit on the dharna? Now the question arises that if such a large number of mlas had sat on dharna in the Vidhan Sabha under such a big planning, then whose plan is this? Who is inside the government, who does not want to see Yogi Adityanath as the chief minister? Is this the next step in the tussle between Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and a powerful minister of the government itself? Well, the people inside the government tell that everything is not going well within the government
 zyaadaatar vidhayak sarkaar main apni baat naa sune jane ko lekar naaraaz hai
 So, is this resentment now moving towards a coup in the form of mobilization? Amidst all these speculations, Yogi Adityanath called some legislators sitting on dharna and dharna
 milanevaale bijepi vidhayakon main se ek harsh vaajapei hai
 He says that we are all in support of Nand Kishore Gurjar
 lekin ye baghawat nahin he
 At least in our government, we got a chance to speak in a democratic manner
 lekin is sawaal par ki agar sarkaar aapaki baat sunati he to aakhirkaar kyon itani badi sankhya main sarkaar ke khilaaf aap logon ko dharne par baithna pada? isapar unhone koi jawaab nahin diya
 Most of the Tamat mlas sitting on the dharna, including Harsh Vajpayee, are considered to be of the anti-yogi Adityanath camp
 jaahir he vidhayakon ne ekajute hokar sarkaar ko sandesh to diya he ki sankhyabal main badi takat hoti he
 By the way, the sources also tell that most of the mlas sitting on the dharna had greeted the birthday of one of the most influential minister of Uttar Pradesh government at home and on that occasion of happiness, also said that if you hint, then your next Birthday we want to celebrate as chief minister purv vittamantri pi chindbaram ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki agar 1991 main rajeev gandhi kii hatya nahin hui hoti, to aarthik sudhaaron ke maamle main ve (rajeev) bhi kul milakar purv pradhanmantri pi

 Google hangout ke jariye walantirs ke saath baatcheet karte hue, kejariwal ne apni sarkaar dwaara vishesh rup se swasthya or shiksha ke kshetra main uthaae gaye kadamon ko lokapriy banane ke liye kaha he
 372 children qualified JEE (mains), Kejriwal said, saying that the AAP government wants to achieve 100 percent literacy in the capital Delhi
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal kaa kahana he ki unhen dilli ke chaatro se shikaayatein mil rahi hai ki ve apane hi shahar ke collejon main admician nahin le paa rahe hai
 Delhi is the capital of the nation
 yah sabhi ke liye he or yahaan sabhi kaa swaagat he
 But some seats in colleges running from Delhi's Tex Pairs should be reserved for Delhi students
 unhone kaha ki maine 28 mahavidhyalayon main aarakshan kaa pataa lagane ke liye manish sisodiya ji se anurodh kiya he
 Aam Aadmi Party had also issued a similar proposal earlier
 dilli ke kai collejon main admician ke liye hai katof ke saath, rajdhani main kai chaatr siten nahin milane kii vajah se shikaayat karte hai
 UGC and AICTE will end soon, know what is the reason Also, the students of Delhi will have to give a tough competition to those who come from outside Delhi to complete their twelfth standard studies
 philhal , dilli technology uniwarsity or indraprastha uniwarsity or indraprastha dilli main rah rahe chaatro ko aarakshan dete hai
 Kejriwal says the proposal of up to Rs 10 lakh has been extended as a guarantor for students seeking education loans under the Delhi government's education scheme
 unhone kaha ki yah yojana dilli collejon main shiksha praapt kar rahe chaatro ke liye shuru kii gai thi
 Now they can avail this scheme to apply for studies anywhere in the world
 yah sahi he ki 30 march ko hue vishwa cap 2011 ke semifinal match main sachin tendulkar kaa kaich vastav main chaar baar choda gaya tha
 He scored a crucial 85 and ultimately Pakistan lost in this match
 mumbai main 2 april ko hue world cap final main bhi bharat kii jeet hui
 These facts support the theory theory that said that this important match was fixed to avoid the embarrassment of Pakistan's Cup win in the city of 26 / 11
 aid hockins kii nai kitaab buki fiksar gambler spi main semifinal match fiks hone sambandhi kiye gaye khulaase ne phir se us vivaad ko hawa de di he jise cricket kii duniya dafnaae rakhana pasand karti he
 Cricket players know that it costs a lot to shock the fans' confidence in the game
 2000 main aadha darjan se zyada cricket ke sitare us vakt kalank kii chapet main aa gaye the, jab dilli police ne ek buki or dakshin africa captain hansee chronie ke bich baatcheet sun lee thi
 This bookie later named Muhammad Azharuddin and Salim Malik
 2010 main pakistan ke teen ubharate sitare spot phixing ke liye rakam lete hue range haath pakade gaye
 It is easy to believe that Pakistan lost the match itself, as its past has been doubtful
 pakistan ke khiladinnon ko cricket se baahar vaid tareeke se dhan kamaane ke zyada maukey nahin milte
 Not only this, it is difficult for him to maintain the opportunities of cricket as there is no stability in the team
 koi gussaya prashansak badi aasaani se is baat par yakeen kar saktaa he ki koi haar maanviya galati se nahin balki haar jane ke liye pehle se tay yojana ke tahat hui he
 It is also easier to believe that Pakistan was sold, than to believe that India had played better on that day
 shaayad srilanka ke prashansak bhi aasaani se yah maan len ki 2012 kaa tii-20 vishwacap final match fiks tha jo yah maanane se zyada aasaan he ki jeetne vaali westeindies team behatar thi
 How can anyone clarify that after chasing West Indies total of 138 runs, Sri Lanka lost four wickets in 13 runs? BCCI Secretary Sanjay Jagdale says that there is nothing that can be done about individuals (in the context of Hawkins) who want to make their mark with sensational claims
 unke shabdon main, ‘‘mujhe nahin lagata ki is tarah ke aaropon se khel kii vishwasaneeyata ke bare main logon kaa bharosa kam hoga
 People understand why there is no evidence for why such allegations are being made and people are also adept at understanding that this is a publicity stunt just to sell their book
 ’’cricket par bani andeh kii chaaya kii tulana lans armastrang ke bare main anwarat chalane vaali afvaahon se karnaa rochak hoga
 Union Cyclists International (UCI), a global organization of cycling, did not pay heed to the allegations of doping
 is bare main nirvivaad sakshya aane par use aakhirkaar karrwai ke liye baadhya hona padaa or vishwa kii mahaan hastiyon main se ek armastrang jameen par aa gaye
 At the same time world cycling also suffered a heavy blow
 bisisiai or isisi ke liye to gadabadi kaa andeshaa hone kii baat uthaane vaale ko hi andeh ke ghere main le aana hairat kii baat nahin
 But by ignoring the message, they are creating a crisis for themselves
 bisisiai or isisi ne agar chetavanee ke sanketon par dhyaan nahin dete hai to unka hashr usiai jaisaa hi ho saktaa he jise is bare main kuch bhi anumaan nahin tha ki doping tantra kitna parishkrut he or kis had tak failaa hua he
 Similarly, the icc's anti-corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) also needs to understand how the betting syndicate is operating
 hawking ne apni kitaab main likhaa he, asiesu ko yah buniyadi jaankaree bhi nahin he ki sattebaaji kii duniya main bracket (khel kii ek tay avadhi jis dauraan sattebaaji hoti he) kaa matlab kya he or tathakthith prashansak kitni aasaani se suchanaaen idhar-se-udhar karte hai
 Hawkins told India Today from London: "ACSU knows nothing about how the betting market in India is doing
 udhaaharan ke liye ravi saavnee (asiesu ke purv pramukh) jaise log to yah bhi nahin jaanate the ki bracket kya hota he
 ACSU needs to double its workforce 
 ek adhikari hi england or westeindies donon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or ek anya adhikari pakistan or bangladesh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 ACSU employees are usually recruited from the police, not a cricket expert who has played the game
 ’’pichley varshon main sattebaaji udyog kaaphi parishkrut hua he
 In-depth statistical description and performance analysis are used to design estimation models
 mausam ke bare main jaankaree aasaani se internet par uplabdh hoti he, pich kaa swabhaav raturaat nahin badalata or aam taur par khel ke ek din pehle hi iske bare main andaja lag jaataa he
 In most cases, the team is largely formed on the basis of logical reasoning - as if the dew is there, India will play with three fast bowlers and a spinner
 soochna gopneey nahin hoti or pradarshan ke pattern kaa vishleshan kar liya jaataa he
 It is common for Chris Gayle and Lasith Malinga to fail on big occasions
 ye donon is baar 7 aktubar ko tii-20 ke final main bhi naakaam sabit hue
 a punter would have guessed that this would happen, simply because he had done his homework well, not because the players were sold
 yadi ek janamat surveykshan sahi sabit hota he to iskaa matlab yah he ki anumaan kaa model kaam rahaa he, yah nahin ki chunaav main dhaandhlee kii gai he
 Bookie fixer Gambler Spy has created a crisis of confidence in cricket
 isane dikhaaya he ki phixing kis had tak fail chuki he
 Bringing legislation on betting is the best treatment because it is not possible for a person to survive in the event of surveillance
 bookies ne to ab gharelu cricket jaise england ke county cricket, ranjai trophy or gharelu or antarrashtriya tii-20 lig main apana jaal failaa liya he
 Former Indian spinner Bishan Singh Bedi says, "ACSU cannot read what is going on in a player's mind
 lekin vah yah to dekh saktaa he ki maidan main kya ho rahaa he
 Players should allow themselves that units like ACSU can monitor them
 masalan, in dinon toss ke liye captainon ke saath match referi kyon jaataa he? isliye ki agar ek baar toss main gadabad kar di gai to unhen rokane kaa koi tarika nahin hota
 Therefore, it is important to understand what is happening on the field and catch it
 ’’ Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar today targeted the Indian Cricket Board after he rejected his demand of $ 1 million (rs five crore) each season for media and governing council related activities related to the Indian Premier League
 gavaskar ne kaha, bisisiai ne mere anubandh par you-turn le liya
 i am surprised that the BCCI refused to pay me pending
 main in reporton ko padhakar hill gaya hum
 The former Indian captain claimed that Sharad Pawar and Arun Jaitley, former BCCI presidents, had promised him that their payments would be approved
 unhone enditivi se kaha, sharad pavaar or arun jetali donon ne mujhe vaada kiya tha ki mere bhugtan ko sweekruti de di jaaegi
 After refusing my offer, Sharad Pawar and Lalit Modi promised me an IPL contract of four crore rupees
 gavaskar ke bisisiai ko patr likhane ke baad yah mudda kal kaaryakari samiti kii baithak main charchaa ke liye aayaa tha
 He said, i requested the BCCI president and he said that he only needs confirmation from Pawar
 pavaar ne iske baad (arun) jetali se baat kii jinhone mujhe aashwaasan diya ki baithak main is mudde par charchaa kii jaaegi
 Gavaskar said he was not worried that the controversy would have any effect on his commentator contract
 unhone kaha, mujhe anubandh ke saath koi takaraav najar nahin aata
 These two are completely different things
 ek prasarankarta kaa anubandh he or doosraa ipel se judi patibaddhta kaa maamla he
 Asked to react to the resignation of Anil Kumble from the post of President of the National Cricket Academy, Gavaskar said, "if anyone talks about a program of his (anil's) credibility, it should be discussed appropriately
" aap bhale hi usase shat pratishat sahamat nahin ho lekin yah dekhnaa hoga ki vah kya kah rahaa he
 The veteran opener believes that the BCCI should have dealt with the Kumble issue better
