 jameen adhigrahan vidheyak kii jaanch ke liye banaai gai sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) ke ek congressi sadsy ne 25 july kii dopaher ko rahul gandhi ko ek text massej bheja
 This was to give him a notice he had received from a fellow JPC member and senior BJP leader: The government would bring back the land bill for the farmers' approval and the social impact assessment sections, both sections of the Manmohan Singh government's 2013 Land acquisition was the basic soul of the law
 congress upaadhyaksh ne sanbhalkar aage badaae kaa faisla kiya or apane jepisi sadsy se kaha ki party ko pakkaa karnaa chahie ki bhoomi vidheyak sansad ke monsoon satr main kisi bhi rup main na aa paae
 After giving a full face to this strategy, Rahul spoke to Youth Congress President Amarinder Singh Raja
 raja ne videsh mantri ke lalit modi kii kathith madad karne ke maamle main 27 july ko sushamaa swaraj ke ghar ke baahar dharne kaa kaarykram banaaya tha or is par unhone rahul kii raay maangi thi
 The plan was set like this: Rahul would lead the 'uproar' in Parliament, Raja's role would be to carry out the spectacle on the road
 rahul 'bhaiya' kii ranneeti ke bare main yuva congress ke adhyaksh kehete hai, ''unhone hameshaa bas ek hi baat kaheeh sadak par utaro, aawaaj uthaao or janata ke harek mudde par unke saath judaav kaayam karo
 "it was Rahul's first and biggest ever victory in the 16th Lok Sabha
" loksabhaa main mahaj 43 saathiyon ke balboote unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sabase thaat-baat vaale vidheyak par sarkaar ko peeche hatane ko majaboor kar diya, vah bhi nichle sadan main endie ke dabang bahumat ke baavjood
 That text message that marked Rahul's first psychological fatah since May 2014, and then his party's rise to some point and leading it to success, eventually led to the next round of state assembly elections Set the mood and tone of the Congress for this - Speak a lot, communicate with the common people and get ready to strike harder than your strength
 fatah ke baavjood ise rahul gandhi kaa doosraa avatar kahana unke samarthakon ko nagavar gujarata he
 Jyotiraditya Scindia, the chief whip of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, says in reality, "this (land Acquisition) Bill is due to him
" is vidheyak ko laane ke liye 2013 main ve sadakon par utre the or ab phir ise bachaane ke liye bhi unhone yahi kiya
 "however, because of Rahul's obsession with the land bill, there has also been a perception that he is against industries - a party that is facing a cash crunch may be further hurt by this perception
" yah tangi is had tak he ki july main congress ke assi-paar koshadhyaksh motilal vora ko chitthee jari kerani padi ki sabhi sadsy party ko 250 ru
 Donate iske alaava party ke mahasachivon ko chhodkar baaki netaaon kii hawaii yatraaon par roak lag chuki he
 "the biggest weakness of Rahul is that he does not have a person like Ahmed Patel who can communicate with corporate houses," says a Congress general secretary
 '' shaayad yahi vajah he ki party main in dinon yah charchaa joro par he ki patel jaldi hi vora kii jagah le sakate hai
 The novelty style is yet to be decided as to how effective this hysterical anti-rahul attitude is and whether this is the best way to re-energize the Congress
 is baat par ek raay he ki unke kaam karne ke tareeke main kai ahm badlaavon ne kaaryakartaaon main jaan foonkane kaa kaam kiya he
 One, Rahul's personal cell phone number has now been given to all the general secretaries and state party presidents
 unke pehle vaale darabanon ko dhata bataakar ab ve unase sidhe baat kar sakate hai
 8 in the morning, seven days including Sunday
 30 baje se der raat 2 baje tak buree tarah thakaa dene vaale andaaj main kaam karte hue in dinon ve phone par sidhe nirdesh bhejte hai ki kis mudde par kya ranneeti apanaai jaani he
 Senior party leaders who had earlier complained that Rahul's office has made him out of reach, are now happy
 unke daftar ke ek sahyogi kehete hai, ''pehle agar ek congress netaa unase milane kaa vakt maangata tha or main kahata tha ki vah agle ek hafte bahut vyast hai, to vah naaraaz ho jaataa tha
 Now he himself says the same thing, but that leader is happy because he has said this directly
 '' yahaan tak ki party ke diggaj netaa bhi khush dikhaai dete hai
 Former Union Minister and Lok Sabha MP Kamal Nath says, "it is easy to meet him and any day he meets more people than the Congress President
" ''ek or ahm badlaav yah aayaa he ki rahul ab kisi ek sthaayee siyaasi team ke bharose nahin rah gaye hai
 Instead they talk to different leaders based on expertise on different issues
 masalan, jab bhoomi adhigrahan kaa mudda bada ho gaya to jairam ramesh ko unki aaramgaah se nikaalkar laayaa gaya
 The mps who have been elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time say, "they are sure to listen to the experts, but the final decision is taken by the Congress Vice President himself; After that they do not do right-left
 misaal ke liye kuch bade netaaon ne sushamaa swaraj, vasundhara raaje or shivaraj singh chouhan ke istifon kii maang ko lekar sansad thap karne kii ranneeti par sawaal uthaae the
 Rahul listened to them patiently but kept to his decision
 ''kareebi sahyogi kehete hai ki sabase ahm badlaav yah aayaa he ki jab apane aasapaas chijen durust nahin chal rahi hon tab bhi ve virodhiyon ko lalkaarane main koi kotahi nahin karte
 Recently in Jaipur, he was discussing with party workers, when a member of the Gram Panchayat interrupted him several times and expressed his frustration over the functioning of the party
 rahul ne apane jawaab ko bijepi par hamale ke maukey main badal diyaaru ''unhone (panchayat sadsy ne) kaha jo unhen kahana tha or ab unhen shanti mil gai he
 But he could say this because he is in Congress
 kya bijepi main koi virodh kii aawaaj uthaa saktaa he? kya koi modi ke saamne bolne kii himmat kar saktaa he?''taatkaalik bhaashan kii kala ko rahul saan par chadhaane kii koshish kar rahe hai—isaki sikh unhen loksabhaa chunaav main modi ke haathon or dilli vidhansabha ke chunaav main arvind kejariwal ke haathon mili congress kii haar se hasil hui he
 Party insiders say they are trying to create a mold that is designed to combine the styles of the two leaders
 chotii ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''muddon ko chunane ke maamle main ve kejariwal ke model par chalate hai, kyonki aam aadmi party kii tivi serial sareekhee siyasat ne dilli main congress ke paaramparik votaron ko chin liya
 At the same time, he learned the importance of spectacle in politics from Modi
 unke hamalon kii dhar or jabaan zyada sahaj or jamini ho gai he
 a trusted confidant of his confesses that Rahul is studying the pre-election speeches in depth — after hearing Modi's speech at Fergusson College in Pune in July 2013, he says that one of his office colleagues He said, "he did not put forward any vision, but the way he spoke, the students liked it very much
" log jo sunanaa chaahate hai vahi baat kahana behad jaruri he
 "perhaps this is the reason why he took recourse to eloquence in a meeting with the students of FTII, Pune on 31 July," a really good film will be made on it — the entire power of the Indian government is trying to sidestep 250 students
 ''rahul jo ek or tarika aajamaa rahe hai, vah party ke liye nae kor group banane kaa he
 In June, he met Delhi sweepers protesting to demand salary and other benefits
 pradarshan main shaamil ek mahila raja rani se rahul itane prabhavit hue ki unhone party ke anusuchit jati prakoshth ke mukhiya ke
 Asked Raju to contact the woman
 40 varshiya yah mahila sarkari karmchaaree hone kii vajah se fouran to nahin jud sakin, lekin party kuch samay baad unhen shaamil karne kaa tarika nikaalane main juty he
 During his visit to Kerala, Rahul met a fisherman, Harapan and after that he was inducted into the party
 dikkatein vahi puranirahul ke himachati kehete hai ki is kism ke nae logon ko laane se party kaa falak bada hoga, vahiin rajyon ke kai netaaon ko lagata he ki sanghathan ke sthaneey dhaanche ko majboot karnaa isse zyada jaruri he
 a top Uttar Pradesh leader says, "they are traveling far and wide, looking for sweepers and haat-market shopkeepers, but why don't they spend some time in their home state Uttar Pradesh?" The road to Delhi goes through Uttar Pradesh and we are a cipher in this state
 '' 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main rajya kii dhaurhara seat se chunaav haar chuke purv kendriya mantri jitin prasad halkaa-phulka bachaav karte hue kehete hai ki party upi ke liye ek ranneeti par kaam kar rahi he
 Rahul will have a big trial in those states where elections are going to be held in the next two years
 inamen se zyaadaatar rajyon main jeetne kii to baat hi chhod den, congress ke thik-thaak pradarshan karne kii ummid bhi kam se kam abhi to dikhaai nahin detii
 The party is playing a third role in Nitish kumar-lalu Prasad Yadav's coalition just before the elections in Bihar this year
 agle saal party do rajyon main dobaaraa satta main aane ke liye vot maangane ko chunaav main utregi
 One of these, the battle between Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and Hemant Biswa Sarma in Assam, which is considered to be the most safe state for the party, is getting worse that the state is also seen going out of the hands of the party
 kerala main mukhyamantri umman chandi or pradesh congress pramukh ve
 M
 sudheeran ke bich badhati khai or saath hi satta-virdohi voton kaa rujhaan party ko rajya kii gaddi se bedakhal kar saktaa he
 Tamil Nadu and West Bengal are also going to elections in 2016 and in both these states, the party has been reduced to a marginal player
 punjab main rahul purv mukhyamantri amarinder singh or rajya congress pramukh pratap singh bajva ke bich chal rahe sankat ko sulajhane main naakaam rahe hai or iske natijatan party 2017 ke chunaavon main ek baar phir kamyaabi se chook sakati he
 Trusting the talk of a senior leader, Amarinder Singh, Lok Sabha MP from Amritsar, has already registered the name of a new party and they are just waiting for the right time to leave the Congress
 aise netaaon kii philhal koi fehrist tak nahin he, lekin jyotiraditya sindhiya ko bharosa he ki rahul party ko nae sire se khadaa karenge or chunaav main fatah dilavaayenge
 Scindia MP from Guna says, very few leaders of India know as much historical and social information about each state as Rahul Gandhi has
 '' apni haal hi kii ek padayatra ke dauraan rahul ko dopaher ke khaane main biryani khate hue jahiraa taur par aparaadh-bodh saalane laga
 It is said that he told one of his colleagues that he is not only eating healthier food, but also is not able to go to the gym - that too sometimes for several days
 kai rajya congress netaaon ko lag saktaa he ki apni gathi hui mansapeshiyon kii rahul ko jitani parvaah he, utani hi phikr unhen vibhinn rajyon main party kii sehat sudhaarney kii bhi kerani chahie
 Of course this is also the only way to get the party out of the ICU in the future
 kya tumne kabhi kisi se pyaar kiya? kabhi kisi ko dil diya? par phir bhi pyaar ekatarfa hokar rah gaya
 There are some who are reluctant to enter this game of commitment
 single rahanaa aazaadee kaa simbel jo ban chukaa he
 But in this race to remain single, most of the boys are seen
 dating ke dauraan ladkiyaan zyada jaldi kamitment dikhaati hai, lekin ladke kanfusion main fanse rahete hai
 Girls do not have much difficulty in identifying the boys running away from commitments
 kuch khaas baton par gaur karne se aap andaja laga sakati hai ki ladkaa kamitment nahin chahta he, jaise:1
 That official prevents you from making your girlfriend
 2
 He repeatedly mentions that his work is important for him and he has to focus on his career
 3
 He does not introduce you to his friends and family
 4
 He does not plan anything in advance, but makes all the plans at the last moment
 5
 The maximum time is available on weekends for dating, but it is not with you on weekends
 6
 It is not emotional
 7
 He befriends and interacts with many girls
 ek ladki ke liye shaayad yah sabase zyada takalifdeh hota he ki jis ladke par wo apana samay or apane imotions invest kar rahi he, wo relationships ko lekar syrius hi nahin he
 In such a situation, the girl does not know where she stands in that boy's life
 man main bas ek hi uljhan, ki wo pasand to karata he lekin pyaar or uske izhaar se bachataa phirata he
 This is not always to be seen
 kai baar koi ladkaa apane kaam ke pressure main ulajhaa hota he, yaa phir apni eks-garlfriend se dhokhaa khaae hota he
 Even in such a case, he shrugs off the commitments
 to aise main ladke ke man ko tatolie
 Perhaps he expects something more than physical relations
 uske saath imotional bonding ke pantare apnaaiye
 Express your concern from office time to dinner
 jab aap apane samay, apni energy or apane imotions kisi ladke main jhonk chuki hai, to phir peeche hat janaa thik nahin
 Understand the needs of the boy of your choice
 or agar kamitment kaa sawaal he, to aap hi pahal kar dijiye

 You would know that Chinese President Xi Jinping is visiting India
 china kaa bharat aana hameshaa hi mahatvapurn ghatana he
 This tour is said to be informal
 koi agenda nahin he
 Both leaders will not give a statement
 lekin iskaa matlab nahin ki daura mahatvapurn nahin he
 In informal conversations, many complex issues are discussed openly
 donon netaa ek duusare kaa man tohte hai
 But look at the coverage in the media
 jab kuch thos bataaya hi nahin gaya he ki saare channel din bhar kya kawarez kar rahe hai
 What information is being given to you more than the rhyme of Mahabali in Mahabalipuram? Every visit is an event in the Modi government's foreign policy
 uski bhavyata itani vishaal he ki sirf camaron se hi adbhut chamak paidaa hoti he
 The nuances of diplomacy do not reach the common people
 isliye aayojan kii bhavyata se sari chhavi bana di jaati he
 Otherwise, the media asks what has changed in the economic relations between India and China from Ahmedabad to 2019 Mahabalipuram in 2014? Media Kashmir will make you an owl while doing Kashmir
 thik he ki seemaa vivaad he
 There is no progress on such issues in a day
 tabhi to netaa aise muddon ko hawa main latakta chhod vyapaarik muddon kii taraf bad bhi jate hai
 It is also okay to do this
 lekin jab aarthik kadam hi aaj kal kii kootneeti kaa ahm paimaana he to us aadhaar par in sambandhon kaa thos moolyankan hona chahie
 What is happening? Some analysis will be found in The Hindu and The Print
 hindi main newzalandry main prakaash ke re kaa vishleshan mil jayega lekin har jagah kapadaa, kaarykram, bhojan par hi baatcheet se is mahatvapurn daure ko nipta diya ja rahaa he
 The trade deficit between India and China has been steadily increasing since 2014
 yani china kaa bharat main niryaat bad rahaa he or bharat kaa china ko niryaat ghat rahaa he
 As a result of this relationship, China has got an open market
 china main naukariyaan paidaa ho rahi hai
 What is India getting? China says 1000 companies are open here
 inamen do lakh logon ko kaam mila he
 That means only 200 in a company
 kya ye kaaphi he?duusari taraf ek chintaa yah bhi he ki agar bangladesh ne china ko apane yahaan vishesh aarthik kshetra banane diya to china bangladesh ke raste bharat ke bazaaron main apana saamaan thel degaa
 It has been five and a half years of the Modi government, but the poor record of the economy is overshadowed by grand events
 ab khabar aa rahi he ki jiesti kii vasuuli kam hogi isliye jin vastuon par riyaayaat di gai thi un par phir se jiesti lagaai jaae
 That means tax exemption for big corporate and GST boot for common people
 aisa aanindyo chakravarti ne apane twit main kaha he
 Meanwhile, there has been news that industrial production 1 in July 2019
 1 pratishat rahaa he
 4 in August 2018
 8 pratishat tha
 This rate of industrial production is the lowest in 81 months
 sarkari press release main 81 maheenaa likhaa he
 Whereas the year should be written so that it was known that 7 years ago had gone so low
 2012 kii tulana main
 - Manufacturing sector has become negative, -1
 2 pratishat
 - The automobile sector growth rate is minus 23 percent
 - scooter kii bikri bhi pichley saal kii tulana main 16
 Has decreased by 60 percent
 - motorcycle kii bikri main 23

 railway main 150 trainon ko nijee haathon main saunpa ja rahaa he
 Looking at the pictures of the Tejas train, you can see how bright it is
 ham bhul gaye ki shatabdi main isi tarah se sahaayak naashtaa or akhbaar varshon se baantta rahaa he
 His costume was not just bright
 aisi chamak paidaa kar bataaya ja rahaa he ki railway kaa pradarshan sudharega
 Is Piyush Goyal failing as Railway Minister? The Railway Minister said in June 2018 that if the train does not run on time, he will not promote the zonal manager
 ek maheene kaa samay diya tha ki trainon ke chalane ke samay main sudhaar karen
 In the year 2017-18, 30 percent of the trains were running late
 uttari kshetra main to 50 fisadi gaadiyaan bhi samay se nahin chal rahi thim
 What happened to that statement? You can also do the research yourself
 kitne kshetreey mahaprabandhakon kaa pramotion roka gaya
 The railway was privatized
 aapako pataa bhi nahin chalaa
 Today, many messages came about train tickets
 patna, aara or gorakhpur kaa kiraaya dekhakar hairaan rah gaya
 The fare of regular running train looks the same as before but the fare of special trains looks unnatural
 1
 The fare for second AC from Delhi to Darbhanga train number 82410 is only Rs 6165
 2
 By the way, if you take the ticket of four numbers in this train, then 2500 will have to be given
 3
 The three AC fare on Patna Suvidha Express to go to Ara on October 24 is Rs 4615
 4
 The fare from Gorakhpur to Motihari on October 27 is Rs 4450
 yah bhi special train he
 Isn't it too much? Special trains are run for the convenience of the people or to rob their pockets? So let's see, the spectacle continues, the pocket is empty
 isliye free kaa tamaasha chal rahaa he
 Result is nothing
 aap kahenge chunaavon main kya hoga, to jawaab he ki maharashtra or haryana main bijepi shandaar jeet hasil karegi
 Everyone is saying this
 is chunaav main bhi koi muqabla nahin he bijepi kaa

 Manish Sisodia, while keeping the book of the donations of the party in front of the public, has raised the demand that political parties should make rules to share the information on the website
 manish sisodiya kaa aarope he ki aam aadmi party kaa sara chanda bank ke madhyam se aa rahaa he or paardarshee tareeke ke baavjood chande ko gaiyrkanoonee bataaya ja rahaa he
 Sisodia also claimed that the charge of not answering the Income Tax Department 34 times is also wrong
 media se baatcheet karte hue manish sisodiya ne khate kaa ek pulinda dikhaaya jisamen aam aadmi party ko chanda dene waalon kii jaanakri maujuud he

 Ashok Prasad donated 123 times from Gurgaon, his bank details, address are all written

 The attack on President and Prime Minister continued during Team Anna's indefinite fast against corruption, while Anna Hazare warned of a fast unto death on the issue of Lokpal
 is bich shanivaar shaam ko jantar mantar par samarthak baari sankhya main umade
 While Hazare talked about going on fast unto death from Sunday, Arvind Kejriwal appealed to Anna that his life is necessary for the country and in view of his health, he should not sit on hunger strike
 unhone kaha ki aazaadee ke turant baad desh ne gandhi ko kho diya, sampurna kranti andolan ke baad desh ne jald hi jaiprakash narayan ko kho diya or ab desh yah sahan nahin kar paaegaa ki anna kii sehat bhi bighad jaae
 In the afternoon, Hazare warned that he would not go on a fast unto death from Sunday, saying that he would not form a political party, but would give good choices to the public by raising good candidates
 congress or bhaajapa ko aade haathon lete hue unhone kaha ki desh in donon ke haathon main surakshit nahin he
 On the other hand, the BJP gave an indirect warning to Team Anna that in democracy, everyone has the right to speak, but while doing so should not cross the limit
 unhone kaha ki log aksar ye sawaal karte hai ki vah raajnneetik dal kaa gathan kyon nahin karte or apane ummidavaaron ko sansad kyon nahin bhejte
 On this, he said that an election costs crores of rupees and he does not have enough money to contest elections, but after the end of this fast, he will visit the whole country and search for such people who will get elections
 To fight
 raashtrapati banane ke baad pranab mukherjee par nishaanaa nahin saadhane ke hajaare or ramdev ke rukh ke vipareet kejariwal ne mukherjee ko nishaanaa banaate hue kaha ki unke raashtrapati banane se kursi kii izzat dooshit hui he kyonki un par bhrashtachar ke aarope hai
 He said that he did not agree that Mukherjee became His Majesty after becoming President and could not be talked about
 unhone kaha ki kya raashtrapati or pradhanmantri bhagwaan se bhi unche hai jo unase sawaal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Democracy means asking questions and if it means treason, then they are ready to face its punishment
 is dauraan hajaare manch par maujuud the
 Prashant Bhushan, another important member of Team Anna, also Mukherjee, Prime Minister Singh and Home Minister P
K
 chidambaram par ek baar phir hamalaa bolaa or apane aarope doharaaye
 Bhushan said, "it is being said that we are spreading anarchy by blaming the Prime Minister and Union Ministers but if the ministers are corrupt then the chaos will only increase
" ’ unhone naksaliyon kaa zikr karte hue kaha, ‘bhrashtachar or garibi se tang aakar hi log hathiyaar uthaate hai or maovadi ban jate hai
 The country is moving towards civil war
 ’ bhushan ne kaha ki sabhi badi partiyaan, chaahe congress ho yaa bhaajapa sabhi badi companiyon kii kathputli ban gayi hai
 Kejriwal said that Manish Sisodia, Gopal Rai and he are sitting on hunger strike and they can continue fasting for the next 60 days, in such a way that Hazare should not go on hunger strike because his life is very important for the country
 udhar chaatr
 About 50 batches of Anna supporters, including girl students, reached the residence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh here and started protesting
 samprag sarkaar or pradhanmantri singh ke khilaaf narebaaji karte hue samarthak shaam kareeb chah baje saat, rescorse road ke baahar ekatrit ho gayi
 Police reached the spot and detained the protesters
 kuch pradarshnakariyon ko pradhanmantri ke ati
 Gates of safe accommodation were also seen climbing, which the police prevented from doing so
 team anna dwaara raajnneetik dal gathan karne kii bahes ke bich kejariwal ne sanketon kii bhashaa main kaha ki bhrashtachar kii samasya kaa samaadhaan koun sa raajnneetik dal de saktaa he, iskaa pataa lagaana he or jab tak samaadhaan nahin nikalegaa vah jantar mantar par hi rahenge
 Kejriwal said that the time has come when the fight is bigger than Janlokpal for the entire revolution
 team anna ke anshan main bheed ke kam hone kii charchaaon par kejariwal ne kaha ki sachai bheed kii muhtaaj nahin he or ant main jeet sachai kii hogi
 i challenge Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to show half of this crowd at their rallies by filling them in trucks and buses
 kejariwal ne media se apil karte hue kaha ki jepi kii kranti main bhi media ne khud ko daanv par laga diya tha or is baar bhi use sachaai kaa saath dena chahie
 He said that the Congress' pole strip is opening up while the BJP is in the same situation
 isse pehle, team anna ke anshan ke chauthe din saptahanth or shaam main khushgavaar mausam hone ke bich khaasi sankhya main samarthakon kii bheed rahi
 a crowd of a few hundred reached around three thousand by the evening, prompting a wave of enthusiasm among the supporters
 logon ke jatthon main aane kaa silsilaa raat tak jari rahaa
 The main opposition party targeted BJP and mps along with Congress on behalf of Team Anna, which is running the movement against corruption, in democracy said that everyone has the right to speak, but should not cross the limit while doing so
 bhaajapa pravaktaa shahanwaaz hossain ne yahaan kaha ki loktantric vyavastha main har kisi ko abhivyakti kii swatantraaa he
 Both society and government have the right to speak
 ve apane adhikaron kaa prayog kar rahe hai lekin kisi ko bhi seemaa ko paar nahin karnaa chahie
 At the Jantar Mantar, the doctors of the Army Hospital also arrived at the hunger strike to take care of the health of the fast
 asian khelon kii vijeta or team anna kii ahm sadsy sunita godara ne apane sambodhan main khel sanghon ke bhrashtachar kaa zikr kiya
 Like Ramlila Maidan last year, a kitchen will be set up for supporters and visitors at Jantar Mantar from Sunday
 purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne apni naveenatam kitaab 'coalishan ears 1996-2012' main likhaa he ki unhen do baar pradhanmantri ke rup main chune jane kii ummid thi
 First in 2004 when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) came to power and secondly before the 2012 presidential election
 congress ke diggaj netaa mukherjee ne yah bhi kaha ki jab sonia gandhi ne pradhanmantri pad ke liye manmohan singh ko apni pasand bataaya tab vah vastav main singh ke adheen ek cabinet mantri ke rup main sarkaar main shaamil hone ke liye anicchhuk the kyonki indira gandhi ke samay main mukherjee vitt mantri the or us samay singh unke junior the
 However, he rejected outright that Manmohan Singh was an 'accidental prime minister'
 tajmahal se jude 6 aise afvaah, jise duniya maanati he sach!mukherjee ne kaha, 'ek majboot rashtravaadi, saahsee or drudh vishwaas vaale vyakti, manmohan singh nishchit rup se ek 'aakasmik pradhanmantri' nahin the
 i am confident that the future will see Manmohan Singh in a different light, like (former Prime Minister) P
K
 ve
 (narasimha Rao) is evaluated today
 mukherjee ne likhaa ki jab sonia gandhi ne 18 may 2004 ko samprag netaaon dwaara rakhe gaye unhen pradhanmantri banane ke prastaav ko khaarij kar diya to party or media main unki (sonia kii) pasand ko lekar atakalein tej ho gai thim
 Know which Indians got apart from Mother Teresa, Nobel Prize Mukherjee wrote, 'there was a general consensus in the Congress party that the Prime Minister to be a political leader as well as experience of the affairs and administration of the party
 is lihaaj se sonia gandhi ke manaa karne ke baad mere pradhanmantri banane kii ummid jataai ja rahi thi
 This finance minister of India had become the first Prime Minister of Pakistan
 He said, 'this possibility was probably being based on these facts because i had extensive experience of working in government whereas Singh had five years as a reformist finance minister
 Apart from this, the civil servant had extensive experience
 aakhirkaar, sonia gandhi ne apni pasand manmohan singh kaa naam aage kar diya or unhen maananaa padaa
 After two consecutive defeats on foreign tours, its effect is now being seen in the team as well
 ab sawaal yah he ki team india ke captanviraat kohliore kocharavi shastrike bich kya sab kuch thik chal rahaa he
 After the recent tour of England, different opinions of both captain Kohli and coach Shastri came up on the issue of practice match
 pehle bhartiya captain viraat kohli ne kaha tha ki vah zyada abhyaas maichon ke paksh main nahin hai
 However, Shastri says that before the start of the Test series in Australia, we have requested the board to organize as many practice matches as possible
 mushfikur kaa bada karnama, dhoni or sangakaara se nikle agebhartiya team 21 november se shuru hone vaale teen maichon kii tii-20 siries se australia daure kii shuruyaat karegi
 India has to tour Australia from 21 November to 18 January for three T20 Internationals, three odis and four Tests
 bataa den ki englad main test siries se pehle abhyaas maichon ko captain kohli ne samay kii barbaadi qaraar diya tha
 But now these things of coach Shastri make it clear that he does not agree with the captain
 asia cap 2018: ye ho sakati he bharat kii plaing ilevanbhartiya team ne england daure par test siries se pehle sirf ek practice match khelaa tha
 This match against Essex was also proposed for the first four days
 baad main team india ke aagrah par ise teen din kaa kar diya gaya tha
 Without a practice match, India lost the series 1-2 in South Africa and 1-4 in England due to no preparation
 aise main nikat bhavishya main kuch faislon ko lekar captain or coach ke bich talmail kii kami yaa vivaad saamne aae to kisi ko hairaani nahin honi chahie

 lekin bihar kii ek beti ke saath jo hua wo nari suraksha ke tamaam naaron par tamaacha he
 This girl, studying in class X, was abducted and sold by two villagers on the pretext of job
 beete 20 maheene main ladki ko desh main alag alag jagahon par kam se kam paanch baar bechaa gaya
 Rohtas Police has recovered the girl from Badaun in Uttar Pradesh and handed over to her family members
 lekin ab bhi is ladki or uske parivaar ko khauf ke saaye main rahanaa pad rahaa he
 Those who kidnapped this girl are being threatened by them
 rohtas jile ke amajhor thana ke tahat saraiya gaanv kii rahane vaali ladki ke sir se pita kaa saaya bachapan se hi uth gaya tha
 The girl's mother raised her with great difficulty
 saath hi use padhane ke liye skool bhi bheja
 On 27 December 2015, Abdul Qureshi, a resident of the village, and his nephew Akhtar Qureshi called Dihri in the name of getting the girl a job
 ladki abdul kuraishi ko chachaa kah kar bulaati thi
 But Abdul Qureshi, taunting the uncle's relationship, sold the girl to someone in Gaya
 gaya main kuch din rakhane ke baad ladki ko phir patna main kanta naam kii mahila ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 She was subjected to many atrocities for forcibly pushing the girl into the swamp of the body trade
 use khaanaa tak nahin diya jaataa
 After some time Kanta was taken to Delhi and sold
 julm kaa silsilaa yaheen nahin thama
 He was then sold to Badaun in Uttar Pradesh
 vahaan ladki se mazdooron kii tarah kaam liya jane laga
 The girl finally got a chance in Badaun one day and informed someone about her phone being in Badaun at her house
 rohtas police ne ek team gathit kar ladki ko laane ke liye badaayun bheji
 On 5 August, Rohtas police rescued the girl from Sarai Mahori village under Faizganj police station in Badaun
 ladki beshak apni maa ke paas pahunch gai he lekin uski pareshaani kaa ant ab bhi nahin hua he
 Abdul Qureshi and Akhtar Qureshi who abducted the girl from the village are absconding
 lekin unke karibiyon kii ore se ladki or uske gharavaalon ko dhamkiyaan di ja rahi hai
 They are being pressured to withdraw the case
 ghar me ghus kar marpet bhi kii ja chuki he
 It is being talked about by the police to go to many places in search of the accused
 udhar, amajhor ke thanadhyaksh benkatesh ojha ne 'aaj tak' ko bataaya ki peedit ladki ke parijanon ne uske apharan kii shikaayat darj karai thi
 During the investigation, the girl has been recovered from Badaun in UP
 bataa den ki naksal prabhavit ilaake se lagaataar ladkiyaan gaayab hone kii soochna milte rahati he
 In such a situation, it is feared that there is no big gang of human trafficking active? However, the girl who has seen hell for 20 months is awaiting justice with security
 dekhnaa he ki bihar main sushasan kii sarkaar ke kaanon tak kab is ladki kii guhaar pahunchati he
 This may sound unbelievable but your toothbrush can be a mine of bacteria

 Toothbrushes can also be contaminated due to being washed with water when we wash our hands
 yaa phir yah isse bhi zyada gande ho sakate he khule flashd toilet kii vajah se
 The dirt falling from the toilet spray floats in the air for a long time until it sits on the surface
 aise main agar aapkaa toothbrush floor par gir jaataa he to paanch second kaa niyam yahaan lagu nahin hota
 Along with bacteria floating in the air, bacteria that grow from your feet on the floor of the bathroom also sit in the brush

 Recently he visited some camps of Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh
 Across the river is myanmar(burma
 ) It's empty now, but a few months ago this area, known as "sabrang," was filled with hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees fleeing Myanmar
 Their trip here was filled with many hardships and tremendous danger
 Many of them made their journey on foot, walking for days through the hills, then floating across the Naf River or the Bay of Bengal on make shift boats
 
 
 many of them injured, pregnant, elderly, etc
 Their ordeal didn't end here
 
 
 after entering Bangladesh, they would often have to wait for days, sleeping in the open fields with no food or water, for aid workers to reach them
 For a lot of the Rohingya children, this ordeal will leave them scarred, physically and emotionally, for the rest of their lives
 With your help, maybe these children can have a chance at a future
 
 
 Because right now, their future is bleak

 In the second half of 2017, the world saw horrific images of ethnic cleansing from the Rakhine State of Myanmar (burma)
 This violence drove nearly 700,000 Rohingya across the border into Bangladesh - 60% are children! Many months later they are still highly vulnerable, living in overcrowded camps with no idea when or where they will ever belong
 
 
 even worse, when they will get their next meal
 AND
 
 
 as they finally start to settle and feel a sense of safety, monsoon season looms
 
 
 threatening to destroy all that they’ve built so far
 This is an entire generation of children that have no future in sight
 Through their smiles i could see the vacancy in their eyes
 These children are at the forefront of this humanitarian crisis, and they desperately need our help
 The world needs to care
 We need to care
 These kids are our future

 unhone likhaa ki, itnaa samay biit jane ke baad bhi rohingya camp main rah rahe bacchon kii haalat bahut kharaab he
 These children will not even know when they will get food next time

 When Mansur Ali, 12 yrs old, first came to the Child Friendly Space (CFS) at the Balukhali camp, he was only drawing scenes of bloodshed and violence
 Helicopters shooting at him and his friends playing soccer
 
 
 or his village and home being on fire with burning bodies all around him
 
 Today, his drawings reflect a more hopeful story, one we would like all these children to have
 Since the # Rohingya children have arrived in Cox’s Bazar, they have been living in overcrowded camps with no real place that to call their own
 Imagine a space that lets you forget your troubles and be a child again
 
 
 even if its only for just a few hours a day
 For the Rohingya children, over 300,000, in the camps in Bangladesh this is the only space that allows them to be kids
 These Child Friendly Spaces created by @unicef give kids access to art, music, dance, sport, and counselling etc
 The space has often proved to be very therapeutic, helping these kids deal with the horrific situations they faced
 
 the @unicef aid workers work tirelessly to make sure these children find their spirit again
 It doesn’t matter where a child is from or what his or her circumstances are
 
 
 NO child deserves a life without hope for the future
 The world needs to care

 'this is little Shohida (8 months old), who stole my heart with her infectious smile
 It's a poignant reminder of the dichotomy of life
 
 
 here she was getting all the help she needed, when just a few months before, her mother, Alada (who was only 19 years old at the time) walked for 15 days, while 6 months pregnant with her ,to get across the border
 It shows us that there is hope left in this world
 When you’re dealing with a mass exodus of thousands of people, who have been displaced from their homes and are desperate for refuge, the need for proper health and nutrition takes center stage
 
 
 especially for women and children
 On the various Unicef Field Visits i have taken, i am always surprised by the simple yet effective solutions that @unicef and their partners develop to deal with the most dire and pressing situations and issues
 This is something i experienced again today during my visit to the Nutrition Center at the Jamtoli camp in Cox's Bazar
 More than 60,000 babies have been born in the camps over the past 8 months, so this center is an essential resource for new mothers to learn about proper feeding and nutrition
 It all begins with the MUAC, a process where the child's middle upper arm is measured to ascertain their nutrition level
 From there, aids create a program for the child and a nutrient rich, ready-to-eat peanut paste is portioned out for each child based on the severity of malnutrition
 At the Center mother's are also taught basic hygiene and good health practices when they are in their homes

 Let me tell you that in 2015 the army of Myanmar launched an aggressive campaign against Rohingya Muslims
 iske baad lakhon kii sankhya main ye sharnaarthi bangladesh aane lage
 Frightened by these conditions, Bangladesh accused Myanmar of destabilizing its country
 bharat bhi in sharnaarthi campon main raahat saamagree detaa he, lekin is samasya kaa koi hal saamne nahin aa sakaa he

 Since 1995, nearly 4 lakh farmers have committed suicide due to drowning in debt, of which around 76,000 farmers have committed suicide from Maharashtra alone
 kheti se judi sabase zyada samasyaayein isi rajya se hai
 Not only Maharashtra, but also in states like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand, farmers have been committing suicide

 Farmers have an important role in the politics of the country
 yahaan kareeb 70 fisadi log pratyaksh-apratyaksh rup se kheti se jude hai
 Generally, before every election, political parties talk about loan waiver of farmers, but after the election is over, they do not pay any special attention to it, forcing the farmers to agitate on the road
 neshnal krime records beuro (enciarabi) kii report bataati he ki karj ke boj tale kisaanon main khudakushi kii dar lagaataar bad rahi he
 If we look at the data of 10 years between 2005 and 2015, then 1 in every one lakh population in the country

 8 farmers are committing suicide
 maharashtra main andolan kar rahe kisaanon kii maang he ki beete saal sarkaar ne karj maafee kaa jo vaada unase kiya tha use puri tarah se lagu kiya jaae
 The debt of all farmers should be forgiven without any condition
 bijli bill bhi maaf kiya jaae
 At the same time, the farmers say that the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission should be implemented and the loans of poor and medium farmers should be completely waived
 kisaanon kii ek or badi maang he ki adivasee vanabhoomi ke aavanton se judi samasyaon kaa nipataara kiya jaae jisase adivasee kisaanon ko unki jameenon kaa malikana haq mil sake
 These are some of the important demands of the farmers, apart from this they also have many other demands which can be improved if they are met
 amuman har sarkaar khud ko kisaanon kii hitaishi bataati he, lekin ek antaraal ke baad kisaan sadak par utarane ko majaboor hote rahe hai
 Thousands of farmers have come on the road again in Maharashtra, the demand of our feeders is not so illegitimate that the government does not have to answer about it

 — varun (@varungrover)august 19, 2019 The next two phases of the Lok Sabha Election 2019 are considered to be a challenge for the BJP and the alliance in Uttar Pradesh
 yah wo suba he, jo sabase zyada loksabhaa saansad chunata he
 a total of 27 seats in the state are to be voted in the next two phases
 sabhi siten upi ke purvi hisse kii hai
 It also includes Lok Sabha seats like Benares and Gorakhpur
 banaras se jahaan pradhanmantri narendra modi chunaav lard rahe hai, vahiin gorakhpur seat mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kaa garh maani jaati he
 In 2014, BJP and allies won 73 seats
 yah pradarshan 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi jari rahaa
 When BJP won 312 seats out of total 403 seats
 2014 kii tulana main is baar loksabhaa chunaav par kai chizon kaa fark pad rahaa he
 This time the election is different from the alliance
 vajah ki 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke vot share kii loksabhaa kshetravaar dalon ke votbank se tulana karne par kai jagahon par gathbandhan kaa vot bijepi ke votbank par baari pad rahaa he
 The other big difference is Priyanka Gandhi Vadra
 rahul gandhi kii choti bahan ne is saal farvari main bahupratikshit rup se sakriy raajnneeti main padaarpan karte hue purvi uttar pradesh prabharee kaa pad sambhala
 For the past few months, people say they have made a big impact and can increase the Congress vote by ten percent
 lekin iskaa vipareet asar mahagathbandhan par pad saktaa he
 Because if the Congress votes will come from the anti-bjp camp then it will be costly for the alliance
 pichhali baar bijepi ko mili 41 pratishat vot ne 85 pratishat siten uski jholii main daal deen
 But 41 percent of the vote is called a wave
 aisi paribhaasha kitabon main to nahin milti
 There was definitely a wave in favor of the Janata Party in 1977, when the party got 48 percent vote share
 vahiin 2015 main, arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party ne vidhansabha chunaavon main 53 pratishat vot hasil kiye the
 The term 'modi Wave' came into force in 2015, it was actually a landslide victory
 wave or landslide main fark jaananaa jaruri he
 The 'wave' means the wave is decided by the 'high popular' vote, while the landslide comes from a large number of seats
 uttar pradesh aisa rajya he, jahaan desh ke anya hisson se kahin zyada dalit or muslim rahete hai
 Here more people live in villages than in urban areas
 magar is baar anusuchit jati kaa vot bijepi se dur ja rahaa he
 The vote is divided between the Congress and the SP-BSP alliance
 muslim vot bhi congress or gathbandhaton ko ja rahaa he
 It is being said that about 15 percent of the Dalits are getting away from the bjp's court
 isamen 10 pratishat vot congress ko or paanch pratishat gathbandhan ko
 The Mahagathbandhan is getting 75 percent of the Muslims and the Congress 25 percent
 aise hi vot 2014 main bhi bante the
 bjp's magic is on the youth
 aise yuvaaon kii taadaad 18 se 25 saal he
 Apart from this, the BJP is also getting the support of women and other backward classes (OBC)
 bijepi ko obisi matadaataaon kaa 55 pratishat, mahagathbandh ko 35 or congress ko 10 pratishat vot milane kii sambhaavna bataai ja rahi he
 At the same time, 50 percent voters of 18-25 years are seen standing in the bjp's court
 gathbandhan ke chalate ucch jatiyon ke bich bhi halchal machane kii sambhaavna he
 The upper class is considered a BJP voter
 uttar pradesh main nau 'bel wedar' siten hai, yani jo siyaasi mausam kaa haal bayaan karne vaaleen maani jaati hai
 These seats have often been chosen by the candidates of the winning party

 Captain Cool Mahendra Singh Dhoni, under his captaincy, made Team India the T20 World Cup, best in Tests, World Jitaya and also made number one in odis
 lekin ab halaat badalte najar aa rahe hai
 It seems that Mahi has started thinking of the team as his property and due to this insistence, the team is constantly getting beaten up
 dakshin africa main mili haar ke baad newjiland main team ko do vanade ganvaa chuki he or iske saath hi ganvaa chuki he vanade main number-1 kaa taj
 In the second ODI on New Zealand tour, Dhoni made 4 such mistakes which also became the main reason for the defeat
 ek najar daalate hai ki kya hai ye chaar galtiyaan-galati number-1toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji kyon? dhoni ne toss jeeta lekin pehle match kii tarah yahaan bhi pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla nahin liya
 When Team India is bowling first and losing again, what is the point of repeating this mistake again? In the last 5 odis, Dhoni won the toss 4 times and bowled first and each time Team India had to face
 galati number-2team main badlaav kyon nahin? vining combination ko naa chhedane kaa logic to sabaki samaj main aata he, lekin lagaataar haar ke baavjood team naa badalane kii ye kisi jid dhoni kar rahe hai? pehle dakshin africa main buree tarah team haari, phir newjiland main pehle vanade main karaari haar hui
 When there was complete scope for at least two changes in the team, then Dhoni fielded the same losing team
 nateeja phir vahi mila or team ne number-1 kaa taj ganvaa diya
 Mistake No
 3 Why in weak team? Players who are proving to be weak links every time, instead of showing them the way out of the team, Dhoni is being given opportunities repeatedly
 gendbaaji main kamjor kadi koun?kehane ko to eshanth sharma team ke sabase senior gendbaaj hai, lekin baar-baar wo na sirf mahange balki puri tarah naakaam sabit ho rahe hai
 Ashwin also has a similar situation, the bowler whose job is to take wickets, he has forgotten the art of taking wickets
 pichhali 7 international pariyon main aswin ko sirf 1 wicket mila he
 In the last 5 odis, Ashwin took 1 wicket after throwing 46 overs
 ballebaaji main kamjor kadi koun?shikhar dhawan, rohit sharma, suresh raina in teenon ballebaajon ne pichley kuch maichon main bahut niraash kiya he
 Shikhar Dhawan has scored just 56 runs in the last 5 matches
 vanade main doharaa shatak jamaane ke baad rohit sharma kaa form aisa gira he ab unase ran hi nahin rahe
 In the last 5 odis, Rohit has scored at an average of just 15
 dhoni ke baad sabase senior ballebaaj suresh raina kaa form ke saath sangharsh lanbaa ho chalaa he
 Why mistake number 4 two spinners? In New Zealand conditions, two spinners are not working well
 upar se aswin or jadeja kii gendbaaji bhi asardaar nahin to 2-2 pes bolers ko bench par bithakar dhoni do spinner ke saath kyon khel rahe hai? jo sikaa baar-baar khota sabit ho rahaa he use naa badalane kii kya majaburi he?ye haar ab isliye bhi chubh rahi he kyonki team india sirf videsh main hi lagaataar nahin haar rahi he, balki ab to vanade ranking main aathven number kii team ne number-1 team ko duusare paaydaan par phisalane par majaboor kar diya he

 aaie jaanate hai ki aakhir kin vajahon se 40 lakh log is suchi se baahar ho gaye
 1
 kadi jodne vaale dastavejalinkage document yani kadi jodne vaale dastavej main jameen ke kagajaat, janm or mrityu kaa certificate, uniwarsity yaa skool kii degree, voter list yaa rashan card main naam or bank / beemaa / post offis ke record shaamil hai
 According to the terms of the NRC, an applicant had to produce any of the above documents to prove his relationship with his Indian ancestors included in the NRC of 1951 or in the electoral rolls up to 1971
 lekin enarasi se baahar bahut se log apni paariwarik viraasat ko sabit kar sakane vaala aisa koi linkage document dene main vifal rahe
 For example, a rural woman had to present a marriage certificate from a Circle Officer, Gram Panchayat Secretary or Sarpanch
 enarasi kaa survey karne vaali team aise dastavejon kii physical veriphication bhi karti thi
 The team came to know that all the married women could not produce proof of their inheritance documents such as fathers, which was obviously a difficult task for women whose maternal uncle is far away or in another state
 enarasi ke koordinator pratik hajela ne ajtak-india today ko bataaya ki linkage document pesh na kar paanaa sabase badi vajah rahi, jisase bahut se aavedakon kaa aavedan khaarij ho gaya
 2
 adhuri matadaata suchiyanaagarikta ko vaid sabit karne ke liye yah mahatvapurn tha ki aavedak ke viraasat kaa pramaan voter list or 1951 kii enarasi main ho
 Voter lists of all districts after 1951 were made available online and in NRC service centers (NSK)
 enarasi ke agjicutive diarector ke daftar main daakhil RTI se mili dastavejon se pataa chalata he ki kai jilon main kuch saal kii matadaata suchiyaan gaayab hai
 This is also one of the reasons why large number of people are rejected in the new NRC draft
 hajela kehete hai ki aavedakon se iske vikalp main kuch or dastavej pesh karne ko kaha gaya tha, lekin aisa lagata he ki unhone kiya nahin
 3
 enarasi 1951 ke aankade kai jagah gaayabsaal 1951 kii janaganana ke baad desh bhar main usee saal neshnal register of citigens yani enarasi taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 It included every person in the 1951 census
 yah register dipti kamishnaron or jilon ke esadm ke daftaron main rakhaa gaya tha
 Later it was handed over to the police
 artiai dastavejon se is baat kii pushti hoti he ki teen jilon-shivsagar, kachaar orcarbi anglangke 1951 ke enarasi data gaayab hai
 Experts fear that this is one of the reasons why many applications are rejected
 hajela kaa daawa he ki saal 2015 main jab draft register banane kii prakriya shuru hui to aisi tamaam baton par vichaar kiya gaya tha
 But it does not appear that any concession has been received in this case
 4
 Those who were unable to provide proof of their citizenship during the amendment of fake voter lists were considered fake voters in Assam
 haalanki unhen 2015 ke enarasi main apana naam shaamil karaane kaa mauka diya gaya
 But the administration said the inclusion of their name in the new register depends on the Foreigners' Tribunal certifying that they are not foreigners
 assam sarkaar ke aankadon ke mutabik rajya main kareeb 1
 There are 25 lakh fake voters
 in sabhi logon ke enarasi aavedan ko lambit kar diya gaya he
 Not only this, unless the tribunal makes a decision about them, their offspring also cannot be included in the register
 5
 The drawback of data entry is that the data entry phase is very important for documents such as the list or NRC
 jaankariyon ko darj karne main hui khami se bhi bahut se log enarasi se baahar ho gaye hai
 Their claims have also been rejected due to mis-spelling of names of many people
 6
 The laxity of other states The nrc's nodal office had sent about six lakh applications to other states for verification
 inamen se 30 fisadi ke bare main hi jaankaree waapas bheji gai
 The NRC had told the affidavit to the Supreme that only 11,4971 cases were sent for verification by the Mamta government of West Bengal, in which people claimed that their origin is in West Bengal

 The 17th Lok Sabha has begun

 The 40-day session has started with the oath of mps
 is dauraan har kisi kii nazar is baat par rahi ki aakhir koun kis seat par baithegaa
 Because with the formation of cabinet, the question of 'who is the number two in the government' started to resonate
 ab ye tasviir saaf ho gai he, sadan ke netaa ke taur par pradhanmantri narendra modi pehali seat par virajman hai to unke baad rajnath singh or amit shah kaa number aayaa he
 Rajnath Singh, who is the deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, tell us that Defense Minister Rajnath Singh is the deputy leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Lok Sabha
 pradhanmantri narendra modi sadan ke netaa hai
 That is, Rajnath Singh's stature is number two in the House
 yahi kaaran he ki rajnath thik narendra modi ke bagal main baithe hai
 In the last house too, he sat with PM Modi
 bataa den ki jab cabinet main unhen grih mantri pad se hataakar raksha mantri kaa jimmedaari di gai to raajnneetik charchaa hui ki unka kad number do se ghataakar number teen kar diya he
 Shah, in place of Sushma, Gehlot BJP President and Home Minister Amit Shah have also elected to Advani's seat this time in Lok Sabha
 vah sattapaksh kii pehali hi line main rajnath singh ke bagal main baithe hai
 Earlier, Sushma Swaraj used to sit on this seat
 unke bagal main thavarchand gahalot hai, jo ki bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani kii seat par virajman hue
 Apart from all these seats, Thawarchand Gehlot was followed by Nitin Gadkari, Sadanand Gowda, then Ravi Shankar Prasad, Narendra Singh Tomar and Harsimrat Kaur in the first row
 unke baad ramvilas paswan bhi dikhe, haalanki vah is baar loksabhaa saansad nahin hai
 But as a minister, he appeared in the House
 aapako bataa den ki sadan main seat mantri pad main varishthata yaa phir kitni baar jeet darj kar ve aae, is aadhaar par milti ai he
 Significantly, this time many senior and old mps are not seen in the House, including big names like LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Sushma Swaraj, Mallikarjun Kharge, Jyotiraditya Scindia
 5 disambar ko jayalalita ke nidhan ke hafton baad deepa jayakumar ne apane samarthakon se kaha tha ki raajnneeti main unki entry ko koi nahin roak saktaa
 He said to announce soon
 iske liye deepa ne AIADMK ke sansthaapak or jayalalita ke guru emji ramchandran kii 100veen jayanti ko chunaa
 Experts also believe that by doing so Jayakumar might want to win over MGR fans and his loyalists, who form a large part of the ruling party in Tamil Nadu
 tippaniyan For the past few weeks, the number of supporters for Jayakumar seems to be growing slowly
 kai AIADMK kaaryakartaaon ko chennai main unke ghar ke baahar dekha ja rahaa he
 Recently, on the 30th day of her death in Jayalalithaa's RK Nagar constituency, a faction of the AIADMK cadre openly said, 'we will not allow Sasikala to stand from here
 hamen deepa chahie
 Activist MM Kumar said, 'we see his beloved Amma in Deepa
 ' However, it cannot be called a purely party view
 jaise ki AIADMK ke pravaktaa siaar saraswati ne kaha 'itane saalon tak deepa kahaan thi? party ne aupchaarik rup se shashikala ko apana netaa chunaa he or chinamma (mausi) ke saath hi puraa kader hai
 ' pichley kuch hafton se jayakumar ke liye samarthakon kii taadaad dhire dhire badhati dikh rahi he
 Many AIADMK workers are seen outside their house in Chennai
 haal hi main jayalalita ke aarake nagar nirvachan kshetra main unki nidhan ke 30wein din AIADMK kader ke ek gut ne khuleam kaha tha 'ham yahaan se shashikala ko nahin khadaa hone denge
 We need Deepa
 ' kaaryakarta mem kumaar ne kaha 'hamen deepa main apni pyaari ammaa najar aati hai
 ' haalanki ise puri tarah party kaa nazariyaa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 As AIADMK spokesman CR Saraswati said, "where was Deepa for so many years?" The party has formally elected Sasikala as its leader and is full cadre along with Chinamma (aunt)
 ' However, it cannot be called a purely party view
 jaise ki AIADMK ke pravaktaa siaar saraswati ne kaha 'itane saalon tak deepa kahaan thi? party ne aupchaarik rup se shashikala ko apana netaa chunaa he or chinamma (mausi) ke saath hi puraa kader hai

 In this sequence, SP Chief Mulayam Singh defended Bahubali Mukhtar Ansari
 mulaayam ne kaha ki mukhtaar kaa parivaar eemaandaar he
 The vice-president comes from that family

 Mulayam Singh Yadav managed to merge this despite Akhilesh's opposition

 Mukhtar won the Mau seat in the 2012 assembly elections

 Mukhtar Ansari has several criminal cases against him including the murder of BJP leader Krishnanand Rai
 bahubali mukhtaar couparashtrapati conectionfilhal jail main band mukhtaar ansaari kaa taalluk uttar pradesh ke gajipur se he
 Mukhtar Ansari's grandfather Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari has been the president of the Congress and the Muslim League during the independence movement
 desh ke maujuuda up raashtrapati hamid ansaari kaa mukhtaar ansaari ke parivaar se conection he
 Even though Hamid Ansari was born in Kolkata, his family has its roots in the family of Ghazipur from which Mukhtar Ansari belongs
 hamid ansaari mukhtaar ahamed ansaari ke 'grand nefyu' hai
 This is the reason that when Mulayam Singh Yadav taught Akhilesh the politics, he explained why it is important for the Qaumi Ekta Dal to stay with the Samajwadi Party
 mulaayam ne akhilesh ko bataaya ki ham mushkil daur se guzar rahe hai or poocha ki kya wo akele party ko chunaav jita sakate hai? Team Anna, who started an indefinite hunger strike on Wednesday, also did not spare Pranab Mukherjee, who was on an indefinite hunger strike demanding the passage of the Jan Lokpal Bill and an independent body to investigate alleged corruption allegations against some members of the Union Cabinet

 On Union Minister Salman Khurshid's remarks about making Team Anna a plea in the United Nations, Sisodia said that people have sent mps with sweat and blood
 majboot jan lokapal kanoon desh ke bheetar or janata ke bich hi banegaa
 There is no need to go to the United Nations

 Until a Special Investigation Team (SIT) is formed against them and the Lokpal Bill is not passed to investigate the allegations

 asal main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa haal main yah bayaan aayaa tha ki vah bijepi or RSS se muqabla karne ke liye aajkal gita or upanishad pard rahe hai
 Assuming that he will not be able to read and understand Bhagavad Gita in Hindi, Tejinder Bagga has prepared Gita in Italian language

 ' bagga kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi ko apni hi bhashaa (italian) samaj aati he, kyonki vah italy se sambandh rakhte hai
 That is why Geeta has been prepared in the language of the same place

 On December 6, Sadar Asif Ali Zardari apparently left his country and went to Dubai to seek treatment for you
 jaradaari jabardast kayaason ke bich 19 disambar ko pakistan laut aae ki ve ek baar phir laapata ho jaaenge, or is baar jaraa zyada hi dil kholkar gaiyr-hajir rahenge
 In such a situation, it seems that the must-haves of a community will remain on a doubt
 doctor sahab, aapane hamen sirf yah bataaya he ki jaradaari ko ''stroke jaise lakshan'' the
 This information, made very neatly mysterious, has made us a little confused and a little anxious to get more information
 stroke jaise lakshan har stroke main ho sakate hai, lekin aisa lagata he ki har lakshan stroke se hi paidaa nahin hota
 Sir, so whether he had a stroke or not? If it was a stroke, where was it? If he was just "stroke-like", you can probably tell us what he was like
 doctor sahab, aap meharbaani karke bura na maane, lekin kya in ''lakshanon'' main aisa kuch khaas tha ki unke liye dubai main ilaaj kii or aapke 'narmand haathon kii or beshak aapke shandaar dimag kii jarurat pad gai?kya islamabad, yaa lahore, yaa karachi main aise kaabil doctor nahin hai, jo in namardood lakshanon kaa ilaaj kar sakate? sawaal isliye paidaa hota he kyonki pakistan ke beadab masakhre or bharat ke neech afvaah-farosh ye baat failaa rahe hai ki pakistan ke sadar ko apane mulk ke kisi aspataal par bharosa nahin he, or ve darate hai ki unhen jehar diya ja saktaa he yaa aisa ki kuch ho saktaa he
 Of course, this cannot be right, because if a Sadar cannot trust his own people, he has no right to continue in office
 lekin jaahiri taur par jab aapane un bure lakshanon ke bare main bataa diya to pashchim ke nalayak patrakaron ne yah khabar failaa di ki jaradaari ''dubai main apane ghar par sehat sudhaarney ke liye aaraam kar rahe hai
 "if Islamabad is not safe enough to take necessary rest for its Sadar, then the situation is very bad
" he naa?doctor sahab, aapako bimariyon kii kaaphi jaankaree he, lihaaja mujhe ummid he ki aap boqaraat (hipokrate) kii half tode bagaiyr iske bare main kuch bataa sakate hai
 Is it possible for a Sadar to suffer a stroke from a memorandum? Apparently, i am referring to the memorandum that was allegedly delivered by pakistani-american businessman Manzoor Ejaz to the Pentagon on behalf of Zardari's Ambassador to Washington, Hussein Haqqani
 
 usamen america generalon se guzarish kii gai thi ki ve islamabad main mumkin takhtapalat ko roke
 As expected, Haqqani flatly denied that he had written the letter, but the things written were so poisonous that Haqqani's senses were shattered
 22 november ko unke istife kaa us infections par jaraa bhi asar nahin padaa jo chitthee kii vajah se bepanaah failata ja rahaa tha
 Haqqanis are neither diplomats by profession nor mood; He was and is the star of the Zardari court
 washington main unki niyukti jaradaari kii taraf se ek tohfa tha
 Combine the two points and you will understand the present crisis of Pakistan
 jaradaari faraar hue lekin chhip na sake
 His' kumat revolved around saying that the Parliament, the press, and his friends in Lahore and around the world would not tolerate another coup
 khaas taur par general parvaiz ashfak kayaani par in bandar ghudakiyon kaa koi asar nahin hua
 The army filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking an inquiry into where the letter started, which has tried to "undermine the Pakistani army
" '' kya baat haih chitthee to naakaam rahi, phir bhi uski niyat baghawat kii thi
 If the Supreme Court, after completing all the process, 'finds a high ranking officer in the court, then the tweezers will bite Zardari
 aise main yah pakistan ke itihaas kaa kanuunan sabase jaij takhtapalat hoga
 As a result, Kayani will regain his fame, and the military's fame, by refusing to sit on the vacant chair and conduct a general election and elect the next wazier Azam and Sadar
 jaradaari ko faisle kii ghadi kaa ehsaas khud-ba-khud ho jaataa he
 Kayani's meeting with Wazier Azam Geelani lasted for three hours on the night of the 16th, which was a non-trivial matter in terms of the gossip of peace
 iske 48 ghante kii bheetar jaradaari dubai main apane ashiyane se islamabad main apane qayaam par aa gaye
 It should not be assumed that no goat of the sacrificer can hear the sound of the knife being sharpened; Actually his imagination makes the voice very loud
 jab leftinent general (rita
 ) Talat Masood, as a military-political commentator belittles, saying that military and civilian leadership are on the path of confrontation, so Zardari does not need any advice to know who will be in the middle of this confrontation
 56 saal kii umr main dubai main aspataal kaa ek bistar atak kii sillen bhari jail main kai baras kaatane se kahin zyada behatar hone chahie, bhale hi vah jail sindhu nadi ke tat par ho or vahaan se himalay ke madahosh kar dene vaale najaare dikhte hon
 So doctor, you saw how important these "stroke-like symptoms" are
 When you get a chance, you will definitely answer

 On the morning of Banaras, the first name comes on the tongue of the people of Banaras, when asked about the delicious breakfast, Pudi Jalebi and gram vegetable and finger pointing to the aunt's shop near Lanka
 ve itnaa hi kehete hai, ''jo majaa yahaan kii jalebi-kachadi kaa he, vah kahin or kahaan
 Ravidas Gate is just a little further away from Banaras towards Lanka to Cantt
 isi chairaahe par kaint jane ke muhane par ek puraani-si dukaan par logon kaa hujum dekh aap chank uthenge
 Alam of the evening is such that here, along with the traffic, customers are seen tasting jalebis while pushing
 inamen apni skuti bagal main khadi kiye branded kapadon main saji biechayu kii management chaatra 26 varshiya kavya bagga mil jaaengi to sthaneey raajnneeti main page adhed pramod kumaar bhi
 This is aunt's shop
 aise main dukaan ke maalik raamji yadav kii is baat main koi shaq nahin ki purv pradhanmantri chandrashekhar jaise diggaj netaa tak yahaan kii jalebi kaa swaad le chuke hai to mashhoor shastreey gayak rajan-saajan mishra idhar se guzarate hai to inkaa swaad lenaa nahin bhoolatey
 Ramji Yadav, the third of the six sons of the late aunt who worked as a gallery attendant at Kala Bhavan, BHU, says, "film actor Rajesh Khanna also once tasted Jalebi while going to Vindhyachal and had abused his aunt 
 ''1908 main khuli chachee kii dukaan ke paas kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay (biechayu) se lekar kareeb chaar-paanch kilometre dur sthit kaashi viapeeth samet tamaam skool-collejon ke chaatro kaa to yah niyamit thor he
 Says Pramod Kumar, "60 percent of the city's people start their day with kachori-jalebi
" chachee kii dukaan se shuruyaat ho to sone par suhaaga
 In fact, in other shops, only kachori-jalebi was available, but at aunt's shop, it was accompanied by aunt's khunti banarasi utterances and abuses adding sweetness to Jalebi
 so yahaan kii aadat-si lag gai
 Parvati aka Channo Devi, whom people used to fondly call aunty, has now passed away
 lekin apane beton ko apana hunar saunp gai hai
 Therefore, that old special taste and charm is still intact
 raamji yadav bataate hai, ''jalebi banane vaali maidani par ham besan kaa halkaa-sa phent maarthe hai
 How delicious the jalebis will become depends on the sensibility of whipping
 kitni der tak or kaise phenta maarna he yah maa ne hamen sikhaa diya tha
 "they tell that they were piled up only when there was a slight mistake," "this is how the shop was looted
 '' raamji chunauti dene ke andaaj main kehete hai, ''hamaare yahaan kii jalebi ko do din tak rakhkar bhi khaaie, uskaa kurkuraapan or swaad bana rahata he
 And the cake is very soft
 ''kachaudee-puri kii hi baat karen to banaras se takreeban 750 kimi dur madhya pradesh kii rajdhani bhopal ke agarwal puri bhandar kaa kuch aisa hi jalawaa he
 This shop, which has been present in the old city since 1947, has gradually made a place that there is hardly any resident of the city who has not come here
 agarwal puri bhandar ke pradeep agarwal kehete hai, ''ham puri or aalu kii sabji ke saath-saath raita or kaddu kaa achaar bhi paroste hai
 People come from far and wide to eat it
 darasal yahaan kaa swaadisht masala ise anya dukaanon se alag bana detaa he
 Similarly, the shop of Mohanji Puri in Harki Pauri of Haridwar, the center of religious tourism of Uttarakhand, has remained the first choice of locals and devotees for 70 years because of its delicious puris
 haridwar main aane vaale shraddhalu ek or dukaan kaa pataa poochhate najar aate hai
 That is the old store of Mathura people located in the cool well in Moti Bazaar, which has been famous for Chandrakala and Malai samosas for almost 92 years
 ise mathura se aae pandit muralidhar sharma ne shuru kiya tha
 It is now run by his grandson Sri Krishna Sharma
 shahar-dar-shahar: apane-apane pakwaan or thikanepichley 80 varshon ke dauraan uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu to bahut badal gai he lekin yahaan ratti ke khaston kaa jaayaka ab bhi barkaraar he
 There is hardly any resident here, who once did not reach Rattilal Khasi shop on Hewett Road, two km north of Charbagh railway station
 khaas vidhi se taiyaar maide kii loi ke bich urad kii daal kii pitthee ko bharkar taiyaar kiye gaye khaste ke saath khaas kism ke chatapate masaale main lipati aalu kii sabji ke diwane subah chah baje se hi rattilal kii dukaan par jutane lagate hai
 This shop, spread over 200 square feet, was opened in 1937 by Rattilal Gupta
 unhone rajasthan ke paaramparik pakwaanon main thodaa sudhaar karke khaste ko ijad kiya tha
 These ravages made the people of Lucknow so much that their name became rusty
 rattilal ke dehanth ke baad is parampara ko unke 50 varshiya bete rajkumaar gupta ne kaayam rakhaa he
 "the specialty of Ratti Khasta is that it is delicious as well as beneficial for health," he explains
 ise is tarah se taiyaar kiya jaataa he ki chiknayee kii maatra behad kam rahe
 "alam is such that at least 500 customers reach here every day
" inhen main se ek 75 varshiya bhimsen sethi kehete hai, ''main pichley 60 varshon se yahaan kaa khasta kha rahaa hum, iske swaad main vahiin jaadu kaayam he
 "not only this, when a customer comes to get crispy for his acquaintances living in another city, Gupta packs it in a special way so that it remains fresh for two weeks
 bhagwaan buddha kii gyanabhumi or pitaron kii mokshabhumi ke taur par bihar ke gaya kii prasiddhi to pracheen kaal se hi rahi he
 But there is another thing that has become the identity of Gaya for the last 150 years
 vah he yahaan kaa tilkut or til kii bani mithaiyaan
 Its story is also interesting
 kasturi tilkut bhandar ke maalik lalji prasad kaa maananaa he, ''kareeb 150 saal pehle divangat gopi saav ne lakhanu kii prasiddh rabadi kii nirmaan kala main sudhaar karke tilkut kaa ijad kiya tha
 However, the presence of Manohar Prasad Kesari Tilakut, the owner of the famous Sri Ram Tilkut store, tells us of the reign of Emperor Ashoka
 jo bhi ho, november se march tak khaskar makar sankranti ke dauraan in dukaanon par aisi bheed umadti he ki logon ko dhakka-mukki karke tilkut khareednaa padataa he
 Bablu Mehta of Mandi Ramna Bazaar, the main shopkeeper of Tilkut, says, "the craze of Tilakut here is such that relatives, leaders and officers and employees of other cities also like Tilakut as bribe
 '' baharhaal tilkut ek alahada mishthann he jo mukhya taur par bihar or khaskar gaya main hi banaaya jaataa he
 If you go to Motihari town of East Champaran in North Bihar, you cannot forget to taste papaya ladoos
 yahaan tarah-tarah ke ladduon ke liye mashhoor dukaan gelord kaa khaas brands hi ban gaya he papite kaa laddu
 Shopkeeper Ashok explains, "about a decade ago papaya sales were low in this area, so my friend's garden papayas were ruined
 aise main hamane papite ke laddu banane kii sochi or yah kaamyaab bhi rahaa
 "rajesh Narayan Sinha, a descendant of King Todarmal, one of Akbar's Navratnas, says," In the last three years after the daughter's marriage, i have taken about 40 kg of laddus to her in Gujarat
 swaad aisa ki uske padosi bhi demand karte hai
 "similarly, the Mirchi Bada of Pokhram Bhati's shop on the new road in Jodhpur, Rajasthan and Kishanlal Agarwal's Lassi shop near Five Batti intersection near MI Road in Jaipur have a different flavor
 kishanlaal ne 1944 main lassi kii dukaan shuru kii thi or unki chauthi peedi ise sambhaal rahi he
 People like Natwarlal Soni come here to taste it from 16 km away from their home, so there is also a crowd of foreigners
 fast food culture main bhi sthaneey pakwaanon kaa jalawajodhpur main mirchi bade kii shuruyaat pokrram ne 1962 main kii thi or ab unki dukaan kii jodhpur main chaar or jaipur main ek branch khul gai he
 Actually people here also use Mirchi Bade with roti
 khanpan ke shaukeen goldi bissa kehete hai, ''bhale hi pizza-burgers kaa jamaana aa gaya ho, lekin yahaan pehali pasand mirchi bade hi hai
 Regarding Banaras aunt's kachori-jalebi, Mayor Ram Gopal says, "it fits in the socio-cultural fabric of Kashi
" yuva bhale hi sadak par khadey hokar ise na khaaen lekin vah bhi pack karakar jarur le jate hai
 "obviously, these cities have their own cultural tradition and identity that such catering has been made in the era of fast food culture
 iske alaava in pakwaanon ko parosane vaale dukandaaron ne apane swaad, innovations or vyavhaar kii badaulat apana jalawaa banaae rakhaa he
 For example, Gaylord of Motihari prepared papaya ladoos, which are also healthy
 sarkari seva main karyrat raviprakash bataate hai, ''mere bachche bhi ise khub pasand karte hai
 It is the best in terms of taste and health, so we do not have any problem
 ''isi tarah lakhanu ke ratti khaste vaale rajkumaar khud to khasta taiyaar karte hi hai, duusare kaarigaron ko bhi khasta banane kaa prashikshan dete hai
 In two dozen places of Lucknow, the artisans trained with them are taking care of their family by putting a hand cart
 rajkumaar ke 27 varshiya bete ravi gupta ne beatech karne ke baad naukari karne kii bajaae apni dada kii parampara ko aage badhaane ke liye pita kaa haath bantaana uchit samajha
 Ravi has opened a new shop in front of his old shop so that customers can enjoy Ratti crispy in a clean environment, not on the road
 iske alaava unhone soshal media ke jariye bhi ratti khasta kii jaankariyaan de rahe hai
 Now advance booking of Ratti Crispy can also be done by messaging on whatsapp
 ravi bataate hai, ''khaston ko graahakon tak pahunchane ke taur-tareeke main samay ke mutabik thode badlaav kiye gaye hai, lekin swaad se bilkul samjhauta nahin kiya gaya he
 Sri Krishna Sharma, owner of the shop in Mathura, Haridwar, says, "it is in the same condition as my maternal grandfather started the shop
" iskaa koi mordenigeshan nahin kiya gaya he or na koi saaj-sajja
 Still people come here asking their names
 '' bhopal ke agarwal puri bhandar ke ashok agarwal kehete hai, videshi khaane kaa swaad kitna bhi bad jaae, paaramparik khaanaa aaj bhi utana hi aakarshith karata he
 "perhaps it is the indigenous cultural-social culture, the traditional taste, and the talent and taste of the shops serving these special dishes that the customer reaches them even through the narrow streets

 lekin rahul gandhi ko 10 maheene tak isaki koi jaankaree nahin the kyonki wo apane sansadeey kshetra kii zaruuraton ke lekar gambhir nahin the

 ' Whenever there is talk of 'big fat wading', Indian marriages first come to mind
 
 
 hamaare desh main aamtaur par shaadi ko itnaa bhavy banane kii koshish kii jaati he ki mehmaanon ko lage, ve kisi raja-maharaja kii shaadi main pahunch gaye hai
 
 
 It is very common for anyone to get mesmerized by seeing weddings in India
 
 
 duniyabar ke chatakile-bhadkile rangon se saji hindustani shaadiyon main mehmaan bhi saikadon, kahin-kahin to hazaron, kii taadaad main pahunchate hai, or phir nibhaane ke liye rasmen bhi bahut hoti hai, jinke liye alag-alag samaaroh hote hai
 
 
 Now think, you are completely 'covering' any such wedding with the iphone held in your hand
 
 
 laga na jhatka
 
 
 ? Comments lekin israel ke puraskrit photographer sephi burgerasan (sephi Bergerson) ne thik aisa hi kar dikhaaya he
 
 
 He recently shot a spectacular wedding in Udaipur city of Rajasthan only through his iphone 6S Plus, and believe it, the results are more spectacular than any wedding album
 
 
 Mashable se baatcheet karte hue sephi ne bataaya, "photography ke liye koi khaas tarkiben nahin hoti hai
 
 
 If i hold the guitar of Jimi Hendrix in your hand, you won't be playing guitar like that
 
 
 yah upkaran ke bharose nahin hota he
 
 
 "after seeing the pictures of this wedding drawn by him, we too have completely agreed with Sephi
 
 
 utyub par aplod kiye ek video main yphone se itane bade samaaroh kii photography karne ke bare main vistaar se samajhaate hue sephi ne Mashable se kaha ki ye tasviren fine art bhi hai, or photo jarnalism bhi
 
 
 He says, "I always tell my clients that taking a photo is not about who attended the wedding, but about how you feel at that moment
 
 
 baad main jab aap un tasveeron ko dekhen, to usee ehsaas ko dobaaraa mahasoos kar paaen, tabhi kamyaabi he
 
 
 " ham aapako bataanaa chahenge ki sephi ne na sirf ye tasviren yphone ke jariye khinchin, balki un tasveeron par post-production kaa kaam bhi yphone par hi kiya
 
 
 So, for those of us who are interested in iphone or photography or Indian weddings or all three, this video will prove to be a great reward, but we are wondering if the iphone will replace DSLR cameras in the coming times
 
 
 
 khayr, jawaab to aane vaala vakt hi degaa, so, philhal yah video dekhie
 
 
 But Israel's award-winning photographer Sephi Bergerson has done just that
 
 
 unhone haal hi main rajasthan ke udaipur shahar main hui ek shandaar shaadi ko sirf apane yphone 6es plus (iphone 6S Plus) ke jariye shoot kiya, or yakeen maniye, nattejey kisi bhi shaadi kii aam album ke mukaable kahin zyaada shandaar hai
 
 
 Talking to Mashable, Sefi said, "there are no special tricks for photography
 
 
 agar main aapke haath main jimi hendrix (jimi Hendrix) kaa guitar pakadaa duun, to aap uski tarah guitar bajaane nahin lagenge
 
 
 It does not rely on equipment
 
 
 " unki khinchi hui is shaadi kii tasveeron ko dekhne ke baad to ham bhi sephi se puri tarah sahamat ho gaye hai
 
 
 In a video uploaded to youtube, explaining in detail how to photography such a big event from the iphone, Sephy told Mashable that these photos are also fine art, and photo journalism
 
 
 vah kehete hai, "main apane graahakon se hameshaa kahata rahata hum ki photo kheenchna is bare main nahin hota ki shaadi main koun-koun shaamil hua, balki is bare main hota he ki aap us kshan kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 
 
 Later, when you look at those pictures, you will be able to feel the same feeling again, only then is the success
 
 
 " We would like to tell you that Sephi not only captured these pictures through iphone, but also did post-production work on those pictures on iphone itself
 
 
 so, hamaare khyal se jin logon ko yphone yaa photography yaa hindustani shaadiyon yaa teenon main dilchaspee he, unke liye yah video behad khubasurat inaam sabit hoga, lekin ham yah soch rahe hai ki kya aane vaale vakt main yphone hi DSLR camaron kii jagah le lenge
 
 
 Well, the answer will only give time to come, so watch this video right now

 How will the Kashmiri separatists face now? Ahead of the beginning of a new chapter in Jammu and Kashmir, a big question is: what is the strategy for the separatist leaders of Kashmir now?

 navjot singh siddhu kaa aawaaj-e-punjab front puri tarah se tuutane ke mukaam par ja pahunchaa he or punjab ke liye apana sab kuch qurbaan karne kii baat karne vaale siddhu pichley 4 maheenon se punjab main kadam tak nahin rakh paae hai
 Sidhu's philosophy is simply t he people of Punjab
 ve
 But the situation is happening now that Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was emerging as a king maker at one time, is neither being asked by any political party nor the voice should stand with him while raising a Punjab front His colleague, who is standing shoulder to shoulder with him, but his two special associates, Ludhiana MLA Bains, have also joined the Aam Aadmi Party without consulting Sidhu and Pargat Singh has also hinted
 We have already said that they too cannot wait much and that their departure in the Congress has been decided
 pehle 'aap' ke saath jane kii thi ummidek vakt tha jab aam aadmi party or congress donon hi navjot singh siddhu ko apane paale main laana chaahati thi
 He was being given a huge offer, in these offers there was also a ministerial post for Navjot Kaur, wife of Navjot Singh Sidhu and the post of deputy CM for Navjot Singh Sidhu
 par shaayad siddhu kii mahatvakanksha isse kahin zyada thi isi vajah se siddhu kabhi aam aadmi party to kabhi congress se baatcheet karte rahe
 Though Sidhu's aide Pargat Singh and Ludhiana MLA Bandhu Bains Brothers gave him full opportunity and time to take a decision, Sidhu might not give up his TV fascination and the result was that now Sidhu's associate Bains Brothers He has left his side and Pargat Singh is also going to give up the hand of Congress by leaving the hand of Sidhu
 ja sakate he congress menwajot singh siddhu haalanki lagaataar surkhiyon main bane hue hai kabhi congress to kabhi aap main jane kii charchaaen bhi aam hai lekin bhaajapa chhodte hi banaaya gaya unke front aawaaj-e-punjab ko us vakt ek bada jhatka laga jab unke front ke do bade netaa ludhiana se vidhayak simrajit singh or balvinder singh jinhen bains bros ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Both formed an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party, without Navjot Singh Sidhu and his ally Pargat Singh
 bains bros kii party lok insaaf party or aam aadmi party ke bich hue gathbandhan ke mutabik lok insaaf party paanch siton par apane ummidavaar khadey karegi or baaki siton par aam aadmi party ko samarthan karegi
 However, on this occasion when Bains Brothers were asked that they had formed this alliance without Navjot Singh Sidhu, they said that they have formed this alliance on the demand of the people and Navjot Singh Sidhu and Pargat Singh are their elder brothers
 And both of them have also been informed about this alliance
 lekin pargat singh se baat kii gai to unhone is par afsos or hairaani jataai or kaha kaash bains bandhu baat karke jate saath hi pargat ne sanket bhi diya kii wo bhi ab congress main jald ja sakate hai
 Decision has to be taken soon, because of this, there is a lot of pressure on Navjot Singh Sidhu to take a decision about his political future as soon as possible or else he will be isolated in the politics of Punjab
 siddhu ke paas ab aakhri mauka yahi bachaa he ki vah yaa to bina shart bains bros ke saath aam aadmi party kaa saath den yaa phir congress kii taraf se jo unhen bina shart party main aane kaa nimantran pichley lambey vakt diya ja rahaa he use vah sweekaar kar len
 However, in both these cases, Sidhu and his wife are not expected to get any huge political advantage
 aise halaat main kaha ye bhi ja rahaa he ki ab siddhu ke paas sirf ek hi vikalp he or wo he congress kyonki akali dal or aam aadmi party donon hi badi partiyaan apane zyaadaatar ummidavaar bhi ghoshit kar chuki hai lihaaja congress hi siddhu ko kahin edjust karne kii kshamta main he or shaayad ab siddhu ko punjab punjabiyat or punjabiyon kii baat bhi yaheen kerani hogi

 For example, all politicians are thieves and those who are on trial are guilty until they prove themselves innocent
 nateeja yah hota he ki aise maamalon se nibatane ke ve apane tareeke khoj nikaalte hai: vishesh fast tarrack adaalatein jahaan unhen jaldi insaaf mil sake
 This is another vivid example of how the privileged people here separate themselves from the system and leave the rest in hell
 yah vaise hi he jaise ek bheed bhare gandale sarkari aspataal main koi viypi ward yaa netaaon kii apni adaalat jaise ki dilli main naukarshahon ke bacchon ke liye apana samskruti skool maujuud he
 The pattern is that if you can open special schools for your children, then i can also open my courts for speedy justice

 It is not easy to explain the reasons for this change
 ho saktaa he aisa isliye hua ho kyonki ab hamaare yahaan yuvaaon kii taadaad kaaphi zyada he or ham aarthik sudhaaron kaa fal chakh chuki teji se badhati ek arthvyavastha kii paidaaish hai
 The product of a society that became hyper-connected (part of the state-of-the-art information system) before being educated or, say, literate
 main aisa kehane ke khatre samajh rahaa hum
 i can be accused of being didactic
 lekin, bharatiyon kii yah samoochee peedi gyaan kahaan se arjeet kar rahi he? aanshik taur par siyaasi muhaavaribaagiyon se, yaa phir sthaneey upadeshkon ke dharmik yaa vaicharik pravachanon se, tivi par prachaar karne waalon se (or meraa aashay puri tarah secular he) yaa phir media se, jisase aprabhavit rahane kii ummid nahin kii ja sakati, jabaki khud nyaaypalika is pravriti kaa shikaar ho chuki ho
 Kargil's war taught the media that patriotism can be a salable commodity, especially in a situation where you have won the war
 lekin pichley kuch barason ke dauraan is deshbhakti ne ek aise rashtrawaad ke liye raah banaai he jahaan yah maan liya jaataa he ki meraa raashtra to kabhi galat ho hi nahin saktaa
 The same thing is disturbing
 deshbhakti or rashtrawaad kaa fark agar aap or behatar shabdon main samajhnaa chaahate hon to main 70 saal puraane jorge orvel ke ek niabandh se kuch vaakya udhaar lenaa chaahuungah “rashtrawaad ko deshbhakti ke saath digbhramit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Here we are talking about two different and opposing views
 deshbhakti se meraa aashay ek vishisht jagah or jivan kii vishisht style ke prati samarpan se he jise aap duniya main shreshth maanate hon lekin jisamen use duusare par thopane kii aakanksha na ho
 "when Europe was ablaze with nationalism, Orwell wrote this precious essay:" Patriotism is a category of defensive nature in both military and cultural contexts
 duusari ore rashtrawaad ko satta kii aakanksha se alag karnaa sambhav nahin he
 He concluded that nationalism is the most dangerous enemy of peace
 is fark ko samajhane kaa ek or tarika he
 i can disagree with my nation, its national policy on any issue, even on sensitive issues like Kashmir and still be patriotic
 lekin yadi main rashtravaadi hum, tab meraa raashtra jo kuch bhi karata yaa kahata he vah mere liye sahi hi hona chahie
 This argument can be strangely transcending boundaries
 aap dekhie ki kaise ham sab ne anderson se hui jhadap ke baad rabindra jadeja ko nirdosh ghoshit kar daalaa tha
 When a judge ruled that the fault of both was equal, we shouted prejudice and partiality
 yah haalat tab he jabaki duniya ke cricket par takreeban bharat kaa hi kabja he
 What Simon Barnes wrote in his book The Meaning of Sport was not for such a changed India: “patriotism is not like nationalism
 apni team kaa utsahvardhan karnaa ek cheez he jabaki yah sochna ki aapke desh ko hi vishwa cap jeetne kaa adhikaar he, team ke haarane par kisi ko to isaki sajaa milani hi chahie, ki aapkaa desh hi duniya ke liye agenda tay karegaa or isse asahmat hone vaala na sirf galat he balki veikshipt he—yah alahada cheez he
 "it should be a very fine thing for India on the 68th anniversary of independence, but this new, conservative and impatient rise of nationalism is bringing problems with itself
" masalan, agar meraa raashtra hameshaa sahi he or aap usase asahmat hai to aap rashtradrohi hai yaa duusare grah ke hi praani hai
 This problem has arisen because Mohan Bhagwat, the head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has just given us a new definition of nationalism: Nationalism i
e
 Hindutva
 yadi aap hindustan main rahete hai to aapako hindu hona padegaa, phir chaahe aap kisi bhi ishwar kii aradhana karte hon
 Do you disagree with this? How dare you challenge our nationalism? Now you have probably understood why i am frustrated despite the round-the-clock change in this nation by ambition to do anything, empowerment of small town-towns, high communication system and up gradation of gadget lifestyle

 rafel maamle par congress or uske adhyaksh rahul gandhi lambey samay se centre kii modi sarkaar par hamalaa bol rahe hai
 Once again, the Congress accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of compromising with the country in the Rafale plane deal
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki unki party kii rafel maamle par jepisi jaanch kii maang sahi he kyonki is masale par court nahin balki sansadeey samiti hi jaanch kar sakati he
 Congress leader and former finance minister p Chidambaram while referring to the report in the media said that in the deal, the Indian Air Force (IAF) made a profit of Rs 186 crore on every aircraft from the government exchequer, depriving them of 90 aircraft of their need
 Given
 2015 main 36 jet ladaaku vimaan ko lekar die gaye order main prati vimaan 41 fisadi adhik keemat par qaraar kiya gaya
 After p Chidambaram's comment, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley responded by tweeting that the Supreme Court has investigated the Rafale prices
 CAG bhi isaki jaanch kar rahaa he
 The new article on Rafale is based on fudged arithmetic - ignore the escalation of the 2007 non-deal offer and compare it with the 2016 price and invent a scam
 — Arun Jaitley (@arunjaitley)january 18, 2019the Supreme Court has examined the prices
 The CAG is examining the same

 chidambaram ne aage kaha ki is sawaal kaa jawaab kabhi kisi ne nahin diya, chaahe pradhanmantri hon yaa raksha mantri (nirmala sitaraman), vitt mantri (arun jetali) yaa kanoon mantri (ravishankar prasad)
 Everybody somehow just defended the Rafale deal

 3 billion euros, which was to be paid for in both the UPA and Modi's deal
 unhone kaha ki agar 126 vimaan kharide jate to daso ko saadhe das saal se adhik avadhi main 1
 4 billion euros would have been received, but in this new deal only 36 aircraft are being purchased and will be received in 36 months
 unhone kaha ki daso company ko do taraf se phayda hua
 First, the price per aircraft has increased and secondly now the government will order 90 planes again, and then the Indian-centric reform will be charged
 modi sarkaar ne desh ke saath do tarah se nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 First, the Indian Air Force has been deprived of 90 aircraft which it desperately needs and second is that 2 on every aircraft

 Digvijay Singh said that though it depends on the creativity of the occasion
 unhone ramlila maidan main haal hi main ramdev ke pradarshan par hui karrwai kaa zikr kiye bagaiyr kaha, ‘‘yadi anna nai dilli main anshan par baithte hai, to maukey kii najaakat ko dekhte hue un par bhi karrwai kii jaaegi
 The Congress general secretary described social activist Anna Hazare as a Gandhian and an elderly leader, and said that his supporters put him on hunger strike by putting him on the 'fuck of gram', whereas it is not right for him to go on hunger strike

 The Congress leader said that the purpose of these so-called organizations is only to collect donations
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main singh ne kaha ki shankaracharya swami swaroopanand swatantraaa sangram senaanee hai or aazaadee kii ladai main ve jail bhi gayi the, jabaki kathith hinduvadi sanghathanon ke log us samay angrejon kii gulaami kar rahe the

 bollywood ke khandaani bacchon ne bachapan se hi cinema khelaa, cinema padhaa or bade hue to cinema ko samajha phir use apanaaya
 These children themselves also became stars and began to pursue their film dynastic legacy
 kapur and family se dharmendra and sans tak, khans ke khandaan se roshans ke raushan chiraag rithik raushan tak, bollywood main jidhar bhi najar daaliye, gujarey jamaane ke sitaron ke bachche jarur najar aate hai
 Some of these children got stardom in the name of Star Guardians, but not everyone got the honor of Star
 kuch ne iske liye khud mashkkat kii or hasil kiya to kuch bacchon ke liye unke abhibhavakon ne jor lagaaya
 For some of these, stardom was still far away
 vahiin kuch aise bachche bhi hai jinhone kamyaabi ke maamle main apane mom-dead ko bhi peeche chhod diya
 In this procession of stars, except Shah Rukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra, everyone else got lucky in the Star Family
 ye bachche janm se hi star ban gaye
 If you look at the actors, be it Salman Khan or Aamir Khan, Ajay Devgan or Hrithik Roshan or new stars like Ranbir Kapoor
 harek ne bollywood ko bachapan se hi acchhee tarah dekha samajha or phir ek din bollywood ne inhen bade aaraam se apana liya
 Bollywood not only adopted these actors but also made Sartaj
 ab salmaan khan ko hi lijie, salmaan kaamyaab film riter saleem khan kii pehali santan he
 Very few people know that Salim Khan himself wanted to become an actor at one time but he became a film writer
 isiilie jab apane sapane ko dohraane kaa number aayaa to unhone apane bete salmaan ko aage badhaayaa or aaj kamai ke maamle main salmaan ban gaye hai bollywood ke tiger
 Similarly, Aamir also carried on the tradition of his uncle producer director Nasir Hussain's film making
 aamir ne shuruyaat chilt artist banakar kii or javaani kii shuruaati filmon main assitant dector rahe lekin phir khud hi actor bhi ban gaye
 This star kid has extended his family's streak of film making to such an extent that Aamir is called Mr
 Perfect of Bollywood
 apane apane pariwaron ke liye aisa hi karishma rithik roshan or ajay devgan ne bhi kiya he
 Hrithik's father Rakesh Roshan himself is an actor director
 haalanki unki kamyaabi kaa graph utana nahin tha
 But when Hrithik worked in his father's films as an actor, he made his father as well as a superhit
 stant diarector veeru devgan ke bete ajay devgan ne bhi stant hero banakar filmon main shuruyaat kii lekin dhire-dhire papa style kii ection filmon se wo shift ho gaye
 In comedy and emotion, and today the situation is that someone else's film demands water at the box office but no one can stop Ajay's victory
 ranbir kapur or imran khan jaise nae star bhi apni apni filmi family kii paramparaon ko hi aage badha rahe hai or kamyaabi paa rahe hai
 Not only actors, daughters of film families are also second to none
 chahen aap thodi si senior star karina ko dekhie yaa phir new qamar sonakshi sinha or sonam ko, har kisi ne filmon main apane apane filmi family kaa agenda aage badhaayaa he
 It is a simple matter, all these stars are those who have been associated with films, and the family of filmgoers since childhood
 jo janm se hi chaandi kaa chammach munh main lekar paidaa hue
 Film lenses, played with cameras, saw his youth in film reels and then made his childhood dream come true on the cinema screen
 rajkpur se lekar shammi kapur, shashi kapur tak or randhir kapur se lekar rishi kapur or ranbir kapur tak
 kapoor-khan's family children have always made their way into Bollywood
 or ab karishma ke baad karina or karina ke baad ranbir ne ye jimmedaari apane kandhon par le lee he
 Sonakshi Sinha, daughter of shotgun Shatrughan Sinha, is one of the fast-moving heroines in Bollywood today
 unke khate main ek se ek badi filmein hai
 Whether 'son of Sardar' or 'dabangg 2', it can be guessed that Sonakshi is another name of superhit these days
 anil kupar kii beti sonam kapur ne bhi film industreat main apni alag jagah bana lee he
 Sonam has proved herself to be a style icon due to her films and more than that her style and her stylish attitude
 aaj bhale hi sonam ke khate main hit se zyada ausat kaamyaab or flops shaamil hon lekin phir bhi sonam ko nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa

 It has been more than a week since the Yogi government assumed power in UP
 pehle hi din se yogi sarkaar ection mod main he
 CM Yogi has taken more than 50 decisions without a single cabinet meeting
 khaskar anti romeo dasta or boojadkhaanon ke khilaaf yogi sarkaar kaa ection charchaa main he
 Apart from this, CM Yogi has special emphasis on improving power system, streamlining government system and discipline in offices
 iskaa kaaran he ki yogi sarkaar ke paas 5 nahin, bas do saal hai
 In this two years, you have to prove your work and win the political battle of 2019 on this work
 piem modi ke bharose upi kii janata ne bijepi ko bahumat diya he or ab desh ke sabase bade rajya menchamatkaarik badlavlaakar modi or yogi kii jodi ko 2019 kaa ran jeetna he
 These are the five promises of PM Modi from UP, on which the Yogi government will first work with priority and will try to make the path of 2019 easier
 1
 Time-less challenges Even though the thousand-year-old government has come to power for 5 years, but now only two years are left in the 2019 general election
 centre kii siyasat main apni duusari pari ke liye upi modi ke liye khaas myne rakhata he
 UP has 80 Lok Sabha seats
 2014 ke chunaavon main bijepi ne 80 main se 71 siten jeetin thi
 Bumper victory has also been won in the assembly elections
 ab chunauti ise barkaraar rakhane kii he
 Modi campaigned among the people with the promise of changing UP
 ab yogi sarkaar par ise puraa karne kii jimmedaari he
 This is why Yogi Sarkar is in action mode from day one
 ek hafte main bhale hi ek bhi cabinet baithak nahin hui ho, lekin50 se bhi adhik tabadatod faisleho chuke hai
 Especially in the system and government offices, the problems of common people are heard, so that CM Yogi is looking tough on government officials and employees
 2
 Not only industry will make agriculture the engine of development, soon after coming to power, CM Yogi announced on the first day that agriculture will make UP the basis of progress
 iske saath hi yuvaaon ko rojgaar dilaanaa or palaayan rokane ko apni praathamikta bataai
 As soon as the new government took power in UP, PM Modi presented his roadmap for the state government
 piem ne kaha- vikaas hamaara moolmantra or makasad he or uttar pradesh ke vikaas se desh kaa vikaas hoga
 Now Yogi Sarkar has to perform
 uttar pradesh kii aabaadi 22 karod he yani desh kii aabaadi kii 16 fisadi, lekin jidipi main upi kaa hissaa sirf 12 fisadi he
 UP ranks 31st in per capita income
 upi main 30 fisadi garib hai, jabaki rashtriya str par ye aankada 22 fisadi he
 According to experts, if there is development in UP, the country's growth rate will increase by one percent
 lihaaja modi sarkaar ko uttar pradesh ko vishesh mahatv dena hoga
 This is the reason why PM Modi sent his most trusted officer Nripendend Mishra to Lucknow to help the Yogi government to gain a foothold
 3
 Law and order challenges will end with anti Romeo law? During the election campaign, PM Modi directly hurt Akhilesh government for law and order
 modi baraabar kehete rahe ki akhilesh sarkaar main kanoon-vyavastha kii haalat ekadam dhwast he
 The daughters are afraid to leave the house in the evening and if the BJP comes to power, the police stations will be converted back from the SP office to police stations
 ab sarkaar bijepi kii he or chunautiyaan bhi bijepi kii
 On the very first day of the Yogi government assuming power, a leader of the BAPAP was shot dead in Allahabad
 lakhimpur khiri main do bahanon kii rape ke maamle ne chunautiyaan or badha deen
 The Yogi government has taken steps towards women safety by creating an anti-romeo squad in every district, but more stringent steps will have to be taken to prevent crime against women
 is morche par safalataa upi ko baaki rajyon ke saamne role model ke rup main pesh karegi
 4
 kisaanon ke chehre par kab aegi muskaraahat?jonpur main 4 march kii raily main piem modi ne kaha tha ki holi ke baad nai sarkaar banegi or sarkaar banane ke baad pehali cabinet meeting main kisaanon kii karjamaafee kaa faisla liya jayega
 It has now been 8 days for the Yogi government to take power
 upi ke lakhon kisaan karj maafee ke faisle kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 SBI and RBI have termed the debt waiver trend as harmful and Finance Minister Jaitley has also announced in Parliament that the Center will not forgive farmers' debt
 jaahir he ab yogi sarkaar ko apane sansadhano ke dam par kisaanon kii karj maafee kaa elaan karnaa padegaa
 The central government knows that if the debt of UP farmers is waived, it will have to be done in other states and resources will be challenged again
 2019 kii jang se pehle yogi sarkaar ko na keval kisaanon kaa karj maaf karnaa he balki kheti ko badhaane or kisaanon kii aay doguni karne ke modi ke vaade ko bhi puraa karnaa hoga
 5
 hindutv ke agenda par atal?bina ek bhi muslim candidet ke upi ke chunavi samar main utari bijepi ne sarkaar main aate hi ek muslim mantri ko cabinet main jagah di
 The selection of Yogi was termed by analysts as an extension of Modi's Shamsan vs Ramadan statement
 khud yogi apane chunavi reliyon main kairana, lav jehad jaise muddon ko pramukhataa se uthaate rahe hai
 The issue of Ram temple is not a yogi issue, but an emotional matter
 ab yogi satta main hai or unhen bijepi ke in saare vaadon par khara utarana he
 They do not have a lack of majority, there is also a plentiful majority in the center and also in the state
 yani ab janata ke saamne koi bahaanaa nahin chalegaa
 Yogi fulfilled the promise in the first week of shutting down illegal slaughterhouses, making anti-romeo squads
 lekin iske liye unhen virodh kaa saamana bhi karnaa pad rahaa he
 BJP leader and Yogi Adityanath himself has been raising the issue of triple talaq very prominently
 ab kya karenge isapar sabaki najar hogi
 Along with this, the challenge of working towards this soon after moving towards the resolution of Ram temple issue and the Supreme Court's comment for out-of-court settlement is also in front of the Yogi government

 The Congress won this seat in 1984, 1991, 2004 and 2009
 lekin bijepi kaa camel yahaan pehali baar modi lahar main pichhali baar khilaa
 The victory also got such that Naveen Jindal, who has been MP for two consecutive terms from here, reached the third position
