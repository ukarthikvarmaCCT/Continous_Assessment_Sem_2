 ' karnataka ke coppal main chunavi raily ke dauraan bijepi adhyaksh amit shah rajya ke siem siddharmaiya or congress party par jamkar barase
 Amit Shah accused the ruling Congress government of corruption and said that the money that the Modi government sends from the center goes into the pocket of the Siddaramaiah government
 amit shah ne kaha ki karnataka main bijepi netaaon kii reliyon main umadi bheed dekhakar lagata he yahambijapi kii aandhinahin tsunami chal rahi he
 He said that the Congress is about to blow in this tsunami
 shah ne kaha ki centre main modi sarkaar ke gathan ke baad karnataka ke liye di jane vaali raashi ko badha diya gaya he
 Shah said that the state received Rs 88,583 crore in the 13th Finance Commission, which was increased to Rs 2,19,506 crore
 amit shah ne na sirf congress sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa balki rajya ke siem siddharmaiya par vyaktigat hamale bhi kiye
 Shah said how many people can wear a watch worth 40 lakh rupees, but Siddaramaiah wears a 40 lakh watch and this proves how he has done corruption in the state
 bijepi adhyaksh ne aarope lagaaya ki siddharmaiya sarkaar ne rajya ke vikaas ke liye kuch bhi nahin kiya
 BJP President Amit Shah also targeted Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 unhone vande maataram vivaad kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki jis rahul gandhi ke man main vande maataram ke liye sammaan nahin usapar desh kii janata kaise bharosa kar sakati he

 petrol or dijal bhale hi aapaki jeb par philhal boj banate ja rahe hon, lekin sabakuch thik rahaa to jald hi ye aapako kamaane kaa ek mauka bhi de sakate hai
 The Indian Commodity Exchange (ICEX) has sought permission from stock and commodity market regulator SEBI to start futures trading in petrol and diesel
 petroleum mantralay isamen vaayada kaarobaar shuru karne kii ijaajat de chukaa he
 Now the final decision has to be taken by SEBI
 agar petrol-dijal kaa vaayada kaarobaar shuru karne ke liye agar sebi kii ijaajat mil jaati he, to aap petrol or dijal ke bhav ghatane par kaaphi zyada maatra main ise kharid sakenge or phir bhav badhane par ise bech sakenge
 This way you will be able to earn profits
 sebi kii manjuuri ICEX yaa anya kisi exange ko mil sakati he
 After this, any person will be able to buy and sell petrol and diesel under futures trading on the exchange as per the rules
 kya hota he vaayada kaarobaar:camodities kii kharid-bikri ke liye exenjon par hone vaale kaarobaar ko vaayada kaarobaar kehete hai
 Usually each commodity has different futures
 vaayada kaarobaar main kaarobaari apni suvidhanusaar kharidari or bikwaali karte hai
 Its condition is that you must buy or sell at least one lot
 iske liye aapako tay margin bhi deni hoti he
 Risky Business: While trading in futures is more profitable, but there is also a lot of risk in it
 aapane kharidari kaa sauda daalaa he or bhav badhane kii bajaay ghat jate hai to aapako nuksaan hoga
 At the same time, if the price increases in the sell deal, then also you will have to bear the loss
 isliye vaayada kaarobaar main vahi log daanv lagaate hai, jinke paas iskaa kaaphi zyada anubhav he
 You will not have to keep petrol: You do not have to keep any commodity you currently buy in futures trading, but you buy it directly on the platform of the exchange
 ab ye dekhnaa hoga ki agar petrol or dijal main vaayade kaarobaar ko manjuuri mil jaati he, to iske liye kya niyam va disha-nirdesh tay hote hai

 desh ke niyantrak evam mahalekhapareekshak (sieji) ne sansad main pesh ek report main mumbai ke kandivali main ek raksha bhukhand kii nijee builder ko kii gai bikri par gambheer aapatti uthaai he
 The report was presented on Friday
 yah 5,166 varg foot bhukhand ke bare main he
 The land was under the Army's Central Ordnance Depot (COD) since 1942
 bhoomi ko ek nijee company ko awasaiya bhawan banane ke liye de diya gaya
 The CAG, after an audit conducted in April 2011, stated that the deal was done on the basis of irregular NOC issued by the Defense Estate Officer (DEO)
 report main kaha gaya ki haalanki is bhoomi se judi kuch bhrasht gatividhiyon kii jaankaree mili he, lekin siodi mumbai rajya sarkaar se is bhukhand ko apane naam nahin kara saki
 The DEO paid rent for it till December 1981, but no rent was paid thereafter, as the state government did not send the bill
 june 1994 main mumbai upshahri jila adhikari ne sena ko bataaya ki ek nijee company ne bhoomi par awasaiya bhawan banane ke liye aavedan kiya or sena se anaapatti praaanpatr maanga gaya
 In August 1994, the COD protested saying that multi-storeyed buildings could not be built around sensitive areas
 or is maamle kii jaankaree usne diio ko di thi
 Later in August 1994, after meeting the representative of the company, the DEO gave the No Objection Certificate but kept the condition of not building the multi-storey building and informed the District Magistrate that there was no objection to the plot being given to the private party
 report ke mutabik siodi ko diio dwaara jari anaapatti praaanpatr ke bare main pataa tha, lekin usne apni kirayedari kii pushti ke liye kuch nahin kiya or na hi apni charadivari sunishchit karai
 About 13 years later, in June 2007, a representative of the private company approached the COD with a copy of two letters issued by the Collector
 sieji ne kaha ki asaamaanya gati se jiladhikari ne 5,166
 The 50 square meter plot was released to him
 isaki keemat bazaar mulya par 5
 94 crores was taken and was captured on 9 July 2007
 tippaniyan In the same month, the DEO requested the District Magistrate to dismiss the land sale, to which the District Magistrate said that the then Revenue Minister had examined the status of the land and confirmed that it was the land of the state government
 iske baad hi ise company ko jari kiya gaya tha
 Two months later, the company told the DEO that its claim had been accepted and it would begin work on it, but the COD is still deploying troops on that land
 report shuukravaar ko pesh kiya gaya
 It is about 5,166 square feet of plot
 sena ke kendriya aayudh depo (siodi) ke adheen yah bhoomi 1942 se thi
 The land was given to a private company to build a residential building
 sieji ne april 2011 main kiye gaye lekhapareekshan ke baad kaha ki yah sauda raksha estate adhikari (diio) dwaara jari aniyamit anaapatti praaanpatr ke aadhaar par kiya gaya
 The report said that although some corrupt activities related to this land have been reported, the COD could not get this plot named after the Mumbai state government
 diio ne disambar 1981 tak iske liye kiraaya diya, lekin iske baad koi kiraaya nahin diya gaya, kyonki rajya sarkaar ne bill nahin bheja
 In June 1994, a Mumbai sub-district district officer told the army that a private company applied to build a residential building on the land and a no objection certificate was sought from the army
 agast 1994 main siodi ne yah kah kar iskaa virodh kiya tha ki samvedansheel kshetra ke aasapaas bahumanjila imaarat nahin banaaya ja saktaa he
 And he informed the DEO about this matter
 baad main agast 1994 main hi company ke pratinidhi se mulaakaat ke baad diio ne anaapatti praaanpatr de diya lekin bahumanjila imaarat nahin banane kii shart rakhi or isaki jaankaree jiladhikari ko de di ki nijee paksh ko bhukhand die jane par koi aapatti nahin he
 According to the report, the COD was aware of the No Objection Certificate issued by the DEO, but did nothing to confirm his tenancy and ensure his boundary wall
 kareeb 13 saalon baad june 2007 main nijee company ke ek pratinidhi ne jiladhikari dwaara jari do patron kii prati ke saath siodi se sampark kiya
 The CAG said that at an unusual pace, the District Magistrate has paid 5,166
 50 varg meter bhukhand use jari kar diya
 5 at its market price
 94 karod rupee lee gai or nau july 2007 ko kabja de diya gaya
 The comments usee maheene diio ne jiladhikari se bhoomi bikri khaarij karne kaa anuredh kiya, jisapar jiladhikari ne kaha ki tatkaaleen rajasav mantri ne bhoomi kii sthiti kii jaanch kii thi or isaki pushti kii thi ki yah rajya sarkaar kii bhoomi he
 Only then was it released to the company
 do maheene baad company ne diio ko bataaya ki uskaa daawa sweekaar kar liya gaya he or vah is par kaam shuru karegi, lekin siodi ab bhi us bhoomi par sainik tainaat kiye hue he

 kya ek duje ke honge salmaan khan or lulia vantoor? kya is saal disambar main salmaan apane janmdin par hi ghodi chadhenge? iskaa jawaab jaanane ke liye salmaan ke fens bekaraar hai
 This is the reason that Salman is asked questions of marriage wherever he goes
 lulia ke saath shaadi kii khabar jabase jor pakadi he, salmaan media se dur dikhe par ifa awords kii press conference main salmaan jaise hi hajir hue 
 
 
 This question was first posed
 lulia ke saath ai tasviren or garm ho rahi shaadi kii khabaron par salmaan ne kaha ki vah apni shaadi kii jaankaree media ko nahin balki twit kar sidhe apane fens ko denge
 Salman said, 'no Baba, why should i tell you people, i will tweet and tell my fans
 ''tippaniyan In the same way, the marriage also started with Sohail Ali Khan, Salman's younger brother, who had abused the reporter on the question related to salman-lulia's marriage
 is bare main tasviren jaise hi saamne ain, viral huin or vivaad khadaa hua or salmaan ko is par bhi safai deni padi
 Salman said that questions about his marriage should not be asked to his family
 baar-baar media kaa mike unke pita saleem khan ke kareeb le janaa reports kii galati thi isliye unke bhai sohail ne reporter ko apshabd kahe
 Looking at the flood of questions related to marriage on Twitter, Salman's care of marriage is more like him and his fans are getting more than his family
 ho bhi kyon na kyonki bollywood ke 'da most eligible bachaler' 50 saal ke ho chuke hai or unki jindagi se kai mashhoor actress jud chuki hai
 In such a situation, the curiosity to know who will stop talking will be more
 philhal to intjaar he salmaan ke twit kaa! Ever since the news of marriage with Lulia caught on, Salman looked away from the media but Salman attended the IIFA Awards press conference
 
 
 sabase pehle yahi sawaal daaga gaya
 On the pictures with Lulia and the news of the wedding getting hot, Salman said that he will not give information about his wedding to the media but tweet directly to his fan
 salmaan ne kaha, 'nahin baba, aap logon ko kyon bataaun, twit karke apane fens ko bataaungaa
 '' Comments vaise baat shaadi kii chhidi to zikr salmaan ke chote bhai sohail ali khan kaa bhi chhidaa, jinhone salmaan- lulia kii shaadi se jude sawaal par reporter ko apshabd kahe the
 As soon as the pictures about this came out, the controversy went viral and the controversy arose and Salman had to explain this too
 salmaan ne kaha ki unki shaadi ke sawaal unke parivaar se nahin puche jane chahie
 Repeatedly moving the media mic closer to his father Salim Khan was the report's fault, so his brother Sohail called the reporter abusive
 twitor par shaadi se jude sawaalon kii baadh ko dekhen to, salmaan kii shaadi kii parvaah jaise unase or unke gharavaalon se zyaada unke fens ko hone lagi he
 Why not, because Bollywood's 'the Most Eligible Bachelor' is 50 years old and many famous actresses have been associated with her life
 aise main kis par aakar baat rukegi, yah jaanane kii utsukata jaraa zyaada he
 Salman's tweet is waiting for now! vaise baat shaadi kii chhidi to zikr salmaan ke chote bhai sohail ali khan kaa bhi chhidaa, jinhone salmaan- lulia kii shaadi se jude sawaal par reporter ko apshabd kahe the

 a survey showed that 1 in 6 married women did not let their husband see themselves in a naked state for more than a year

 survey main shaamil16 fisadi mahilaon ne daawaakia ki pichley 12 maheenon ke dauraan yaa isse bhi zyada vakt se unhone ek baar bhi apane partner ke saamne kapade nahin utaare hai
 About half of the women said that this is because they feel insecure about their figure and appearance, while every third woman blamed the lack of sex drive
 lagbhag 40 fisadi ne kaha ki isse unka rishta prabhavit hua he or 36 fisadi ne mana ki lagaataar khud ko dhake rakhane kii koshish ke chalate pati ke saath unka jhagada hota he
 ukmedix conducted this poll
 com kii sara baile kaa kahana he, 'mahilaon kii sex life ke liye shaareerik aatmavishvaas behad jaruri he or aisa lagata he ki isamen kami aa rahi he, jisase dikkatein bad rahi hai
 'she told,' Most women say they did not let their husband see themselves for 12 months or even longer
 'sara ne kaha, 'mahilaon ko ye yaad rakhana chahie ki ho saktaa he ki unhen apni body pasand naa ho, lekin unke partner use pasand kar sakate hai

 kehete hai is duniya kaa sabase bada boj hota he, kisi baap ke kaandhe par bete kii laash kaa boj
 If the burden of any father's shoulder falls on him due to reasons like destiny, nature, destiny or being, then people give him comfort
 lekin log tab kya karen, jab ye boj kisi baap ko bas, system ke nikammepan kii vajah se uthaanaa pade? kanpur main kuch aisa hi hua, jahaan kab ke mar chuke system ne jite ji ek baap ke kaandhe par usee ke maasoom bete ko maar daalaa
 In a government hospital in Kanpur, a father ran his sick son from one ward to another on the shoulder
 isi bich kab us maasoom kii jaan chali gai, khud us badanaseeb baap ko bhi pataa nahin chalaa
 This painful story that haunts the heart belongs to the Halat Hospital in Kanpur
 aspatal main na strechar mila na wheelchairfajalganj ilaake ke rahanevaale sunil 26 agast ko apane biimaar bete ansh ko lekarilaaj ke helat aspataalapahunche
 But there was neither a wheelchair nor a stretcher
 ansh kii haalat behad kharaab thi
 So, Sunil reached the emergency ward of the hospital with him, but the doctors there showed him the way to the children's ward before examining the child or getting any initial treatment
 strechar yaa duusari koi madad nahin milane ke kaaran sunil bachche ko kaandhe par ladakar immergency se children ward tak pahunche
 The innocent part lying on his shoulder lost his life
 aspataal se nahin mila ambulanceyah ek baap kaa dil hi tha, jo maasoom kii maut kii sachai ko bhi maan nahin sakaa
 Even after this Sunil kept pleading with doctors with Ansh's body on his shoulder, but by then it was late
 harkar unhone ab ansh kilash ghar le janeka faisla kiya, lekin system kii sadaandh ne yahaan bhi unka rasta roak liya
 No corpse vehicle nor ambulance was found from the hospital
 kaandhe par laash or mukhya sadak tak paidal safarsystem ke maare sunil ne kaandhe par hi bachche kii laash rakhkar aspataal se baahar kareeb do sau meter main road tak kii duuri tay kii
 From there he somehow got out of the house in an auto
 lekin in tasveeron ne ye dikhaa diya ki tarakkee ke lakh siyaasi daavon ke baavjood uttar pradesh ke is sabase bade shahar main medical suvidhaon kii asaliyat kya he or sarkari tantra kaise kaam karata he

 Fairs and Festivals Countries Every festival in India is associated with mythology, but it has temporal meaning and significance
 aise hi tyoharon main rakshabandhan bhi he jise shravan maheene kii poornima ko manaaya jaataa he
 According to common practice, on this occasion, the sisters tie the Raksha Sutra on the right wrist of their brother and the brother in turn gives the gift according to the strength
 rakshabandhan main raakhi yaa rakshasutra kaa sabase adhik mahatv he
 Rakhi can range from inexpensive items like raw yarn to colorful arts, silk yarn, and expensive items like gold or silver
 saamanyat: bahanen bhai ko hi raakhi baandhti hai, lekin brahmanon, guruon or parivaar main choti ladakiyon dwaara sammanit sambandhiyon ko bhi baandhi jaati he
 Girls and women decorate a plate of worship after retiring from the bath in the morning

 raakhi kaa tyohaar kab shuru hua yah koi nahin jaanata
 But there is a description in the Bhavishya Purana that when the war started between Devas and Demons, demons started dominating

 Incidentally, it was the day of Shravan Purnima
 skandh puraana, padmapurana or shrimadbhagwat main vaamanavatar naamak katha main rakshabandhan kaa prasang miltaa he
 Lord Vishnu took the Vamana avatar to destroy the arrogance of Danavendra king Bali and came to ask alms to King Bali in disguise as a Brahmin
 bhagwaan ne bali se bhiksha main teen pag bhoomi kii maang kii
 The Lord measured the entire sky, the earth and the earth in three steps and sent King Bali to the abyss
 bali ne apni bhakthi ke bal par bhagwaan se raat-din apane saamne rahane kaa vachan le liya
 Narada told Lakshmi ji a remedy to bring back the god
 lakshmi ji ne raja bali raakhi baandh apana bhai banaaya or pati ko apane saath le ain

 The story of Rakshabandhan also connects to Mahabharata

 har saal vailentins de aata he, lekin usase pehle hi aa jaati hai iskaa virodh karne kii dhamkiyaan
 This year is no different
 bajrang dal ne vailentins de par parkon, restraon jaisi jagahon par pyaar kaa izhaar karne vaale jodon ko sabak sikhaane kii dhamkee di he
 Bajrang Dal District President Subhash Bajrangi in Ghaziabad says that any couple found in parks and restaurants will be photographed and uploaded on social media so that their families can also see
 subhash bajrangi ne kaha ki unka sanghathan pyaar kaa virdohi nahin he lekin pyaar ghar ke andar hota he, sadak par nahin
 The Bajrang Dal believes that Valentines Day is a conspiracy to corrupt the culture of India, which we will oppose in any case
 jab subhash bajrangi se poocha gaya ki unke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai bhi ho sakati he to jawaab mila ki samskruti kii raksha kii khatir ve har karrwai bhugatne ko taiyaar he
 The question is why the perceived culture love of Bajrang Dal wakes up every year on Valentine's Day itself? They should also be asked which law gives the right to Bajrang Dal or other organizations like this to become 'moral Police'

 jarine ko bollywood main entry salmaan khan kii vajah se mili thi
 When Salman was shooting for the film Yuvraj, Zarine also came to see the shooting there
 jab salmaan kii najar jarine par padi to unhen laga ki jarine princej jaisi dikhti hai or unki agali film vir ke liye sahi chaharaa hongi
 The weight of this heroine of Salman was 100 kg, now looks like she became the lead actress of Veer film
 haal hi main jarine amtivi par prasaarit hone vaale tivi sho amtivi trol police main host kii bhoomika main najar ain
 In this, he replaced Rannvijay Singh
 maal va seva kar (jiesti) kii nai vyavastha ke lagu hone ke pehle sau din ke dauraan uske kharaab kriyanvayan ko lekar khaasi aalochana hui
 Hence, a slight change in the tax structure and policy was announced in the GST Council meeting on 6 October chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 saakh bachaane ke pher main der-saver is tarah ke kisi kadam kaa andeshaa to tha hi, khaastaur par yah dhyaan main rakhte hue ki jald hi kuch rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai
 The latest announcements were intended to provide relief to exporters and small traders and reduce tax rates of 27 items
 lekin 1 july ko jiesti lagu hone ke baad se in kshetron ne jo takaliphen sahi hai, unki bharpai karne ke liye maujuuda kadam paryaapt hai?esemai ke liye thodi raahatajiasti ke mul disha-nirdeshon ke tahat salanaa 75 lakh rupye tak turnover vaale chote or majhole upakramon ko compojishan skim ke tahat 1 se 5 fisadi tak kaa ekamusth kar dene kii chhot di gai thi
 But there was no provision for taking input tax credit (ie to deduct tax burden on the basis of tax already given on inputs)
 iske alaava yah skim un logon ke liye bhi nahin thi jo duusare rajyon ko aapurti karte hai
 Then, those who were doing business with non-registered suppliers were obliged to pay GST under the reverse charge mechanism (RCM)
 saamanyatya aapurtikaron ko bikri par jiesti adaa karnaa chahie, lekin jahaan aapurtikar gaiyr-panjikrut hai, vahaan jiesti vah adaa karegaa jo vastu yaa seva praapt kar rahaa he
 The demand for the withdrawal of such anomalous rules had grown rapidly
 jiesti main ab jo sanshodhan kiye gaye hai unamem compojishan skim ke liye paatrata ko 75 lakh rupye ke salanaa turnover se badhaakar 1 karod rupye kaa salanaa turnover kar diya gaya he
 Apart from this, the issue of eligibility for composition scheme for inter-state traders was also referred by the GST Council to the Group of Ministers
 phir gaiyr-panjikrut companiyon (jinhen jiesti se chhot mili hui he kyonki unka salanaa turnover tay seemaa se kam he) ke saath vyapaar karne waalon ke aaarasiem prakriya ke sambandh main aavedan ko bhi 31 march, 2018 tak ke liye taal diya gaya he
 Another amendment emphasizing inter-state services is in relation to inter-state traders
 mul rup se to jo log inter state supplai karte hai, antar-rajya shramikon ko chhodkar, unhen anivaary rup se panjikrut karana hi hota tha, bhale hi unka turnover kuch bhi ho
 In other words, the exemption from compulsory registration to companies with an annual turnover of less than Rs 20 lakh (rs 10 lakh in the context of north-east states) was not available to inter-state suppliers
 ab council ne sevaaon ke chote saplyrs ko raahat dete hue seva pradaataaon ko antar-rajya panjikaran praavdhaan se mukti de di he
 Inter state service providers are also eligible for exemption if their turnover is below the exemption limit
 yah chhot vastuon kii inter state supplai par lagu nahin hoti
 Quarterly filing of returns
 5 karod rupye tak turnover vaale esemai ko raahat dete hue jiesti council ne yah praavdhaan kiya he ki aise karadaataaon ko masik aadhaar par na to kar adaa karnaa hoga or na hi ritern daakhil karnaa hoga
 From the third quarter of this financial year, such taxpayers will be able to file quarterly returns
 aise karadaataaon ke liye timahi kar ritern daakhil karne kii nirdhaarit tarikhon kaa elaan baad main kiya jayega
 Till then all taxpayers will have to file GSTR-3B every month by December this year
 iske alaava sabhi karadaataaon ko july, agast or sitambar, 2017 tak ke maheenon ke liye form jiestiar-e1,2 va 3 bhi daakhil karnaa hoga
 The deadline for filing returns for August and September is yet to be announced
 ye saare kadam madadgaar to hai lekin behatar hoga ki jiestn ko apane kaamkaaj main sthirataa laane ke liye thodaa or vakt diya jaae, kam se kam ek or saal
 It should also be realized that the mandatory procedures related to GST are registration, filing of returns, payment of taxes and refunds
 samajhadaari isi main hogi ki philhal in prakriyaaon ko sthir hone diya jaae or invais-maiching jaisi baaki prakriyaaon ko philhal taal diya jaae
 Relief to exporters The council has decided to start the process of IGST refunds on goods exported between July and October 10

 In such circumstances, all the Taliban will put their weapons here
 lekin agar aisa nahin hua to phir ham yudhviram ke apane faisle ko palat bhi sakate hai
 The Taliban have created such panic in the tribal areas of Pakistan that people are forced to live with suffocation
 pakistan sarkaar chaah kar bhi taliban kaa kuch nahin bigaad paa rahi he or ab hukumat-e-pakistan ne taliban ke saamne sir jhukaa diya he
 Now only Taliban law will work in Swat
 ab sawaal ye he ki kya taliban ke sharai kanoon main waisi hi zyadatiyaan likhi hai
 As he has been persecuting people till now
 kya aise hi bevajaah log taliban ke kode khate rahenge
 Is it helplessness or politics? dushman kii taraf dosti kaa haath badhaane ke peeche paak sarkaar kii manshaa bhala kya ho sakati he
 Pakistan is demeaning the US threatening to wipe out the Taliban terrorists hiding in it, or else it is trying to keep the fundamentalists who are walking in the country happy at all costs
 manshaa jo bhi ho pakistan ko bahut mahangi pad sakati he
 Swat is in the grip of Taliban law
 kahin skool tode ja rahe to kahin logon par kode barasaaye ja rahe
 Somewhere innocents are being necked
 phir bhi taliban se nahin ladanaa chahta pakistan
 He is compromising with him, saying that do whatever you want in Swat but do not pick up the gun
 sawaal he aakhir kyon ghutane tech rahaa he pakistan
 The agreement with Taliban in Swat is not Pakistan's new trick to throw dust in the eyes of the world
 sharia kanoon lagu karne ke evaj main taliban se shanti samjhauta kar rahaa he pakistan lekin jaankaro ke mutabik america kii tedi najaron se bachane kii ye pakistani chaal he
 The United States, which has been carrying out constant drone and missile attacks in the FATA region of Pakistan, has clearly said that it will not hesitate to do so if it needs to enter Pakistan and attack it for the elimination of the Taliban
 swat main taliban kii lagaataar badhati aatankwaadi harkaton par bhi america kii najar he
 It is clear that Zardari rule is only good for showing your control in Swat at any cost
 itnaa hi nahin daramil yudhviram ke samjhaute se ek tir se do shikaar karnaa chaahati he paak sarkaar
 In Swat, the Taliban leader Mullah Fazlullah, the biggest proponent of Sharia law, and his father-in-law Maulana Sufi Muhammad, dominate the area
 talibani netaa sufi mohammad ke sharia kanoon lagu karne vaali muhim taharik-e-nifaaz-e-sharia-e-muhammadi ko pakistan kii kai siyaasi partiyon samet army or iesai kaa bhi khulaa samarthan mil rahaa he
 Former Pakistani General Pervez Musharraf also believes that the dominance of fundamentalists on Pakistan is increasing
 jaahir he jaradaari hukumat kii bhi hifaazat tabhi tak he jab tak iesai, army or kattarpathiyon kaa ye gathjod khush he
 At the same time, Pakistan also wants to show the US that it is not right to fight the Taliban on the strength of strength and it will be better to resolve the issue only through dialogue
 lekin america is deal se khush nahin or pehle bhi sij fire kii koshish bekaar gai he
 Therefore, this move of the Pak government can also be a big burden on him
 swat main sharia kanoon lagu ho jane se pakistan kii muskilen khatm nahin ho jaati
 Rather the troubles on Pakistan will start to break from here
 ye taliban kii pakistan sarkaar par pehali jeet he
 How far its Taliban will go, it can be clearly estimated
 taliban chahta he ki puure pakistan main hukumat-e-taliban
 From Swat Valley to Karachi and then Islamabad, followed by Lahore
 kya dhire-dhire karke taliban kar legaa puure pakistan par qabza
 The evil intentions of the Taliban are clearly pointing towards this
 taliban kii zid ke aage swat main pakistan sarkaar puri tarah se ghootane tech chuki he
 The Pakistani government has surrendered and said that the Taliban will do whatever they want in the Swat Valley
 ab sawaal ye he ki aaj zaradaari ji ne swat main taliban se haar maani he
 But the Taliban is a cancer for Pakistan which is spreading and will gradually make Pakistan so weak that the government of Pakistan cannot do anything and the introduction of Sharia law in the Swat Valley is the first victory of the Taliban
 taliban ke sargana batulla mehsood or moulana fazalulla ne khuleam elaan kar diya he ki ab unka aglaa target islamabad he
 a newspaper of Pakistan International The News recently reported that this Taliban threat is being written on the walls of Islamabad, which the city's administration is trying to wash away
 taliban ke dabadabe vaale ilaake swat se islamabad kii duuri mahaj kuch sau kilometre hi he
 The Taliban also demonstrated their strength by attacking a police check point in Mianwali district in Pakistan's Punjab province last week
 karachi main pichley dinon jis tarah se 85 talibani aatanki pakade gaye hai usase zaahir hota he ki taliban karachi main apana adda bana chukaa he
 Not only this, the Taliban have carried out many fidayeen attacks in Rawalpindi too
 taliban kaa makasad ek he pakistan par hukumat-e-taliban or wo gaahe begaahe iskaa muzahiraa bhi kar rahaa he
 The strength of the Taliban is increasing due to the internal cooperation of Pakistan and it is not surprising that one day the Government of Pakistan will have to surrender to the Taliban all over Pakistan
 aaj beshak taliban pakistan ke vajood par hamalaa kar rahaa he
 But once the same Taliban was climbing in the lap of Pakistani intelligence agency ISI and Pakistani army
 parvej musharraf ne apane mulk ke angan main inhen phalne-phoolne kaa mauka diya
 Now the same Taliban has grown up showing them not only eyes but they have started swallowing the whole of Pakistan
 pehle afgaan-paak seemaa ke kabeelai ilaake, phir phata, phir swat, phir peshawar, phir baluchistan or ab najar sidhe islamabad par
 The pictures of all these areas of Pakistan are constantly getting scary
 auraton ko burke main kaid kiya ja rahaa he, ladakiyon ko skool se dur rahane ke farmaan jari ho rahe hai
 There is a ban on making shaves of men
 naujavaanon ke haathon main hathiyaar thamaaye ja rahe hai or chote bacchon ke jism par barood baandhakar unhen maanav bam banaaya ja rahaa he

 Despite nearly 90 lakh mobile piracy in the financial year ended 31 March 2013, the Central Registry scheme of the government has not been started yet
 is yojana ke tahat chori hue mobile kaa pataa lagaaya janaa tha
 According to a dot official, a trial in this regard was started by the American company Telecordia Technology in January which did not succeed
 kyonki bharat main badi taadaad main aise mobile handset kaa istemaal ho rahaa he jo kisi naa kisi phone kii chloning kar banaai gai he
 Every year a large number of cheap mobiles are coming to our country from China
 dot or TRAI ke in mobile phone kii chloning ko rokane ke saare prayaas vifal ho chuke hai
 And now they are becoming a matter of concern for the security of our country
 ek varisht adhikari ne hamen bataaya ki bharat main hajaaron mobile phone kaa IMEI number ek he
 There is widespread cloning of mobile phones coming from China
 china se farji IMEI number vaale mobile kaa aayaat rokane ke liye tri ne 2011 main vaanijya mantralay se anurodh kiya tha
 But TRAI has not yet received any reply in this regard
 tri ne is baat kii maang bhi kii thi ki china se sirf certyphoid mobile phone kaa hi aayaat kiya jaae
 The funny thing is that the current chairman of TRAI, Rahul Khullar, was the commerce secretary in those days
 telecom secretary emef faruki ne bataaya, ' mobile handset ko lekar soochna ikattha karne kii hamaari koi yojana nahin he
 But if anyone needs any information about a cloned mobile or SIM, we will provide it
 'cellular oparator association of india ke diarector general rajan es mathew ke mutabik har mobile handset kaa ek unic sicurity code naa hone se bharat main chloning kii samasya teji se badhati ja rahi he
 It should be stopped immediately, otherwise the antisocial elements of the original handset may be misused

 During an investigation in 2011, 18000 mobile handsets of the same IMEI number were found in a certain area

 This strike by the lawyers had a major impact on the judicial functions

 Congress will show in Delhi on Saturday, Mighty Priyanka Gandhi is busy mobilizing the crowd in Delhi, after the rout in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress is now trying to stand again
 is kadi main congress shanivaar ko dilli ke ramlila maidan main 'bharat bachaao raily' kar rahi he
 Which will be addressed by party president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 is raily main priyanka gandhi kaa raajnneetik effect bhi najar aaenge
 Ever since Priyanka Gandhi got the command of Uttar Pradesh, the Congress has been seen agitating on the streets in the state
 aise main charchaa joro par he ki 14 disambar ko dilli ke ramlila maidan main hone vaali raily main priyanka gandhi kaa siyaasi asar bhi dikhegaa kyonki raily ko safal banane ke liye unhone lakhanu main teen din rukkar rup rekha banaai he
 After this, it is believed that Uttar Pradesh's participation in the rally crowd is going to be big
 siyaasi napha nuksaan ke nazariye se dekhen to uttar pradesh main congress ko philhal koi badi safalataa haath nahin lagi he
 It was fought under the leadership of Priyanka Gandhi, whether the Lok Sabha elections or the by-elections in 13 assembly seats, the Congress has not performed well in this
 iske baavjood soobe main priyanka gandhi kaa asar hone laga he
 This matter is being discussed in Uttar Pradesh political circles
 priyanka gandhi lagaataar twitor or apane bayanonke jariye yogi sarkaar par hamale bol rahi hai or yogi sarkaar bhi priyanka gandhi ke bayanon or twitor par jabaab dene main vakt nahin lagaati he
 Whether it is the case of land massacre in Sonbhadra or the case of burning the rape victim in Unnao, Priyanka Gandhi has turned twenty from her opponents in both the places
 soobe main badi ghatana hone par jis tareeke se priyanka gandhi apane ko duusare siyaasi netaaon se aage rakh rahi hai, yah unhen uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti main alag mukaam de rahaa he
 In the sonbhadra-unnao case, Priyanka showed that the party's position may not have improved even after getting the charge of Uttar Pradesh in the active Lok Sabha elections
 bhale pehali baar amethi kaa chunaav bhi haar gai ho lekin in sabake baavjoodpriyanka gandhi effect uttar pradeshmen party par dikhaai de rahaa he
 Priyanka Gandhi was the first to dodge the administration in Sonbhadra, but when the administration stopped her on the way, the entire political party Priyanka was robbed, because Priyanka Gandhi was seen standing with the victim's family in this case
 es hi kuch maamla haal main unnav kii rape peedita cese main bhi hua, jab use jalaakar maar dene kii ghatana saamne ai to priyanka gandhi sabase pehle peedita ke gaanv pahunch gayi
 On the one hand, Priyanka reached the village of Unnao victim, on the other hand, Congress leaders and activists came out on the streets to encircle the BJP office and eat lathis fiercely
 congress ke log bataa rahe hai ki pichley kai dashakon se congress ke netaaon ne sadakon par aisi laathiyaan nahin khai he
 Perhaps it was the Priyanka effect that Akhilesh Yadav also sat on a dharna in front of the assembly at the same time and Mayawati also reached to meet the Governor
 upi main congress nibhaa rahi he mukhya vipaksh kii bhoomikacongress ke upi pravaktaa or priyanka kii team ke ahm sadsy rajeev tyaagi bataate hai ki priyanka gandhi kii samvaad style bahut hi behatar he, jisaki vajah se vah pradesh ke kisaanon, naujavaanon or mahilaon se sidhaa samvaad kar paa rahi hai
 Priyanka Gandhi prominently raised issues like DHFL, Midday Meal, LDA Scam, including Sonbhadra Shahjahanpur Unnao and UP Government corruption cases
 iskaa hi nateeja he ki pradesh sarkaar ko jhukna padaa or maange manani padi
 Clearly, the 'priyanka Gandhi Effect' has started appearing in Uttar Pradesh's politics
 congress pramukh vipakshi dal ke rup main apane aapako pradesh kii siyasat main sthapit kar pai he
 The same, according to BJP spokesperson Dr
 Chandramohan, the people who talk about the Priyanka effect in UP have seen how the party under Priyanka has lost Rahul Gandhi's seat and how the vote share in Sonia Gandhi's seat went to the abyss is
 itnaa hi nahin upachunaav main bhi congress apni seat nahin bachaa pai
 However, due to Priyanka Gandhi's activism, the Congress has started moving around and the government also seems more cautious
 iske alaava priyanka gandhi ne 14 disambar ko dilli main hone vaali raily ko safal banane ke liye jis tarah mehnat kiya he
 The result will be seen on Saturday

 May the year 2019 be good for all of you, with this blessing, let us look today in those wishes of the year 2018 which could not be fulfilled
 naa daaud ibrahim bharat laayaa ja sakaa
 Neither Hafiz Saeed could be dragged to the threshold of Indian law
 naa pakistan sudhara naa kashmir main halaat patari par laute
 Neither Nirbhaya's criminals could be hanged or the death certificate of Baghdadi was signed
 nahin aayaa daaud ibrahimpiem narendra modi or grahamantri rajnath singh ne apni spich main kai baar kaha ki jald hi anderworld don daaud ibrahim ko bharat laayaa jayega
 So what happened to Dawood kahaan he daaud
 The new government had promised that Dawood would be brought to the knees by the court
 93 ke dhamaakon ke vakt jo paidaa hue the wo jawan ho gaye
 And those who were killed became old by the path of justice
 magar hindustan ke sabase bade gunahagaar ko 2018 main bhi nahin bharat nahin laayaa ja sakaa
 Even today the court of India is waiting for Dawood
 sarkarein ye bhi to dilasa nahin de saktin ki wo daaud ko dhund rahi he
 Because sadly, the home minister of the country knows where Dawood's whereabouts are
 aapako haq he janaab aap ninda kiijie
 Condemn magar itnaa to bataa dijie ki unka kya karen jinhone apano ko in dhamaakon main khoyaa he
 Should they make a decision by changing the calendar just this time too
 aap hi kah dijie
 We will assume that this too was a jumla
 phir kisi or par bharosa karenge
 And then we will wait for the next five years
 or ham kar bhi kya kar sakate hai
 And what have we come to do
 hafiz said ko nahin mili sazabollywood kii is film ne bataa diya ki jab ghi sidhi ungali sa nikle to use tedhi kar lene main hi ganimat he
 Now it would be utterly unfair to expect Pakistan to punish his trump card for the crime he committed in India
 lihaaza pakistani adaalat main jo kuch hota hua aapako dikh rahaa he use bas chhalaava maan lijie
 It is just a brainchild
 jab tak duniya pakistani hukmaraanon par nakel naa kasegi 26 / 11 kaa ye darinda yun hi azaad parinda bana rahegaa
 America banned jamaat-ud-dawa
 hafiz par inam ghoshit bhi kiya or yuan main pakistan ko gherne kii koshish bhi kii lekin baar baar china aade aa gaya
 Now Alam is that Hafiz Saeed is not only roaming free in Pakistan but also fighting his party in elections
 beshak hafiz ke karindon kii zamaanat zabt ho gai ho lekin uski ye koshish bataa rahi he ki pakistan kaa bhavishya khatre main he or padosi hone ke naate bharat ko bhi sachet rahanaa hoga
 Still free, Masood Azharkandhar, released in lieu of the Hijack, is the most feared terror in the world has been a problem for Indian security agencies since his release

 And now its fire-burning audio tape against India sitting in Pakistan
 bharat ko dhamkaane kaa masood azhar koi mauka nahin chodta he
 If Hafiz Saeed is involved in plotting against Hindustan, then Masood Azhar is Pat
 is baar to isane bharat sarkaar or pradhanmantri modi ko ye kehete hue dhamkaaya he ki agar ayodhya main babari masjid kii jagah mandir bana to dilli se kabul tak ye tabaahi machaa degaa
 Along with this, he has also made it clear that his terrorists are in India

 or naa sirf manch balki beete paanch saal main bhaajapa ke sankalp patr main bhi puri tarah se badlaav dikhaa
 Who was present on the stage
 
 
 ?somvaar ko bijepi mukhyalay sankalp patr jari karte vakt pradhanmantri narendra modi, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah, grih mantri rajnath singh, videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj, vitt mantri arun jetali, sanghathan mantri raamalaal or kendriya mantri thavar chand gahalot maujuud the

 haalanki, is baar inamen se kisi kii tasviir shaamil nahin he
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manohar Parrikar are no longer in this world, while shivraj-raman-vasundhara Raje is no longer the chief minister

 For this reason, senior leaders like Advani, Joshi were being offended by the party

 It often happens that we like something that immediately buying is out of our budget
 aise samay main hamaara saath detaa he credit card jisase ham cash na hone par bhi manachaahi cheez kharid lete hai or agar gres period ke andar hi bhugtan kar den to byaaj kaa nuksaan bhi nahin hota
 The biggest advantage of this is that the payment is not immediately deducted from your bank account, while the debit card is immediately deducted
 lekin kya aap jaanate he ki agar aap kuch baton kaa dhyaan na rakhen to aapako kaaphi nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 1
 aapane aksar dekha hoga ki jab kabhi bhi aapke acount main balance minimum se neeche aa jaataa he to mobile par massej kaa ambara lag jaataa he
 But you do not get any message for depositing the bill of credit because the company does not want you to make all the payments in the first month itself
 balki companiyaan to ye chaahati hai ki aap or let karen or baad main let fees bharen
 2
 graahakon se aksar free iemai credit card par jiro percent par iemai kaa vaada kiya jaataa he
 But you will be surprised to know that the terms and conditions apply to EMI at zero percent interest
 agar ek bhi shart kaa ulanghan karte hai to 5 yaa 10 nahin balki 20 pratishat se bhi zyada byaaj chukaana pad saktaa he
 3
 bank aapako kabhi bhi khud se nahin bataata he ki aap apane points ko kaise ridim kar sakate hai
 In such a situation, due to lack of information, millions of points are left lying and the credit card expires
 iske alaava jab aapke points 1000 se 10,000 jaise landmark ko cross karte hai tab bank aapako ye nahin bataata ki aapke itane point ho gaye hai or aap unhen ridim kar cashbek laabh le sakate
 4
 bank aksar aapako ofer dete hai ki aapafri of cost apane silver card ko goldemein or gold ko platinum main apgrade karvaa sakate hai, lekin ye nahin bataate ki naye credit card ke liye aapako 500 rupye se lekar 700 rupye tak kaa shulk bhi dena padegaa
 5
 credit card dharakon ko aksar ek kol aati he ki aap ke credit card kii credit limit muft main badhaai ja rahi he lekin bank aapako kabhi ye nahin bataata ki iske baad aapkaa vaarshik shulk bad jaayegaa
 The Congress had become hopeful after the 2013 debacle in Delhi
 aalaa kaman ne bedaag netaa ke rup main ajay maakan ko dilli chunaav kii kaman saunpi
 His team was so excited by Maken's project that he even prepared a Victory Speech for him before campaigning
 uski ek copy unke ghar ke paas puraani magazine or raddi akhabaaron ke saath mili
 That was provided to us
 maje kii baat ye he ki bhaashan kaa print out 14 disambar 2014 ko liya gaya tha
 The Congress has been given less than five seats in the exit poll, but it is still possible to take a look at this speech prepared for Maken, brothers and sisters

 mere bujurgon or mere tamaam saathiyon
 Today Delhi has proved that she trusts her own
 meri jeet, meri party kii jeet
 
 aapaki jeet he
 Delhi people win
 har dharm, har varg ke logon kii jeet he
 The anger Delhi people showed 14 months ago returned us by making them love and blessings
 congress party par bharosa karne ke liye ek baar phir aapkaa yani puri dilli kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad
 i want to thank you
 or apni party kaa bhi jisane mujhe dilli ke liye ye jimmedaari saunpi thi
 i want to thank Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi
 jinhone meri seva or dilli waalon ke pyaar ko samajhate hue mujhe ye ahm mishan diya
 You once again respected the work of my party and my family, thanks to the people of Delhi and all the voters of Sadar Bazar Assembly for this again
 mujhe aaj bhi wo din yaad he, jab 1993 main, 28 saal kii umr main pehali baar mujhe party ne rajouri garden se tikat dekar aapaki seva ke liye bheja tha
 And showing confidence, the people of Delhi sent me to the assembly for the first time by winning 3000 votes
 dilli kii janata kaa pyaar badhata rahaa or phir se rajouri garden kii janata ne 1998 main mujhe 18 hajaar voton se jitakar vidhayak banaaya
 Not only this, in 2003 also the people of Delhi gave me love and won with 24 thousand votes
 bhaaiyon
 
 
 When the party high command fielded me in the Lok Sabha elections against Jagmohan from New Delhi in 2004, the same Delhi sent me to Parliament by winning 15 thousand votes
 iske baad dilliwaalon ne mujhe phir se 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 1 lakh 90 bazaar voton se jeet dilaai
 And today again gave me my love and blessings by winning me from Sadar Bazar assembly seat
 is pyaar or arshivaad kaa sila main apane kaam or seva se duungaa
 i am glad that the people of Delhi rejected the false promises
 sampradayik takaton ko karaara jawaab diya
 Those who left the field were defeated
 dilli vaale jaanate hai ki baaten karne vaale or vaade karne vaale kya kar rahe hai
 What the central government of BJP is doing was also in front of the public
 dilli waalon ne sabit kar diya ki wo jhooth bolne waalon or dharm kii raajnneeti main nahi balki vikaas or sachai kii raajnneeti karne waalon ke saath he
 i want to tell you, the work done by our Congress Party government in Delhi in the first fifteen years is not hidden from anyone
 wo chaahe sadakon kii baat ho yaa phir fliover banane kaa kaam, sabhi hamaari sarkaar ne dilli ko viksit karne kaa kaam kiya tha
 And now this new government of Congress will also continue its development journey
 main vaada karata hoon ki ham apni un galatiyon ko sudhaarenge jinaki vajah se hamen pichley chunaav main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 Brothers 
 Sisters
 
 
 congress party ne dilli ke is chunaav se pehle jo vaade kiye the
 Our government will work hard to fulfill them in the next 5 years
 aapako yaad hoga ki hamaari pichhali sarkaar ne hi dilli ko pradooshan mukt karne kaa kaam kiya tha
 When i was the Transport Minister of Delhi, i myself prepared the draft of the CNG project
 kai logon ne or virodhiyon ne kaha tha ki ye kaam mumkin nahin hai lekin aapke arshivaad se maine is kaam ko anjaam diya tha
 Reduced pollution of Delhi
 hamaari sarkaar aage bhi dilli kii behatari ke liye, dilli ke vikaas ke liye aise hi kaam karegi
 We all have a feeling of electric water problem or problems of slum dwellers
 iske hal ke liye ham milakar kaam karenge
 Brothers 
 
 bahanon
 
 
 Our aim is to give Delhi a corruption-free government
 isamen aap sabakaa sahyog chahie
 The government will take strong measures from where corruption will come
 or main ant main ye kahana chahta hoon ki dilli ke saath jo rishta lalit maakan ji kaa rishta tha use maine aage badhaaya to aapane mujhe pyaar or arshivaad diya
 And i will work to strengthen our relationship through this government
 main aabhaar jataata hoon aap sabakaa
 
 
 For this trust of the party and the honorable Sonia ji and Rahul ji
 ummid karata hoon aap sabakaa pyaar isi tarah milegaa or ham dilli ke vikaas or tarakkee kii ek nai kahani likhenge

 When you hear the name – # kareenakapoorkhan, you know that she was born a star
 The beauty has graced filmfare covers many times but this time it's all the more different and special since the country's favorite now has an adorable son, Taimur Ali Khan
 And boy, Kareena is looking hotter than ever in this photo shoot
 She has nailed every look with such ease and elan - and this time around the icon is looking like an ultimate seductress with her bold kohl eyes
 Kareena Kapoor Khan is not only a talented actor but also a fashion icon and that's the reason we picked her to be the cover star of our annual fashion issue
 High on style and oomph, these are Kareena's best pictures till date

 chidambaram kii idi remand 30 oktober tak badi Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that till now 11 PM has happened in the country, Narendra Modi (PM Narendra Modi) is the 12th PM but Modi is the first PM in whose time job destruction has happened rather than job creation
 
 itihaas modi ko iske liye naukari vinaash piem ke taur par pukaaregaa
 Jairam Ramesh said in a press conference that PM has no right to lie
 piem baar-baar kehete hai ki unke kaarykaal main record rojgaar die gaye
 Whereas one crore people have been unemployed in the last year due to demonetisation and GST
 unhone kaha ki 16 november 2018 ko piem modi ne kaha ki mudra yojana ke tahat har ek ne 4-5 logon ko rojgaar die
 On 24 November 2018, PM said in Chhatarpur that today 25 crore families in the country benefited from the Mudra Project
 unhone kaha ki 90 fisadi mudra yojana ke tahat sahaayta raashi 25 hajaar rupee ausatan he
 What employment can it stand for? agar 25 hajaar rupee main se koi vyakti 3-4 logon ko rojgaar de saktaa he
 There are three types of loans under the Mudra scheme
 rojgaar nirmaan karne waalon main tarun or kishor ketegory aa sakate he jabaki sarkaar khud kahati he ki 90 fisadi lone ketegory shishu ke tahat thi
 This is from 1999
 tab 29 varshiya rahul gandhi apni maa sonia gandhi ke saath haryana main hisar kii ek raily main maujuud the
 Many party leaders were sitting on the dais, but Rahul stood like a spectacle and was trying to understand the entire atmosphere of the rally
 raily ke dauraan hi unhone bheed ke bich se plastic kii ek safed rang kii kursi manch kii ore khinchi or use congress vidhayak dal kii netaa karatari devi kii taraf badha diya, kyonki ve manch par khadi thim
 This heir of the Gandhi dynasty is characterized by a sense of sympathy, reflected in his public life for years, but his personality as a leader appears weak
 haal hi main tej-tarraar patrkaar arnab goswami ko die gaye ek intervyuu main congress party ke upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne zyaadaatar sawaalon kaa sidhaa jawaab diya
 But he looked absolutely inexperienced
 us intervyuu main unka koi rutaba bhi nahin najar aa rahaa tha, na hi intervyuu ko apane hisaab se apni disha main le jane kaa koi chaturaai-jabaki kisi mahatvapurn rajaneta ke vyaktitv ke liye ye saare gun behad jaruri hai
 Rashid Kidwai, who wrote a biography of Sonia Gandhi, says, "what is the brand Rahul? It is not clear at all
 ” kidawai haryana kii us raily main maujuud the or netaa ke taur par rahul ke safar ko kareeb se dekhte rahe hai
 But the opinion of a dialogue expert is different
 ve rahul ke bare main bani is aam raay se sahamat nahin hai ki ve janata ke saamne nausikhua najar aate hai
 He says, "in face-to-face conversation, he seems very conscious
 ” dilli ke ek brands kansaltent kaa kahana he ki rahul nae vichaaron kaa puraa swaagat karte hai
 Their views may be offbeat, but deliberate
 rahul ke saath jo log kaam kar chuke hai, ve maanate hai ki unke vyaktitv main kai paraten hai
 Rahul's advertisements have been rejected by many brand experts, saying they are half-baked, redundant, scattered and delayed
 in par 500 karod ru
 Expenditure is being told
 parfect relations ke sansthaapak or image manager dilip cherian kehete hai, ''un logon ne yuva chhavi ko to acchhee tarah se pesh kiya he, lekin itnaa hi kaaphi nahin he
 "another communication expert, Santosh Desai, says that the brand is the idea that you give and" that connects people on a human level
 ” rahul gandhi khud ko aise netaa ke taur par pesh karne kii koshish kar rahe hai, jo nai tarah kii raajnneeti kii kalpana kar rahaa he, ek jamini netaa, mahilaon or yuvaaon kaa netaa
 Desai, managing director and CEO of Futurebrands India, says, "these points are not emerging effectively in their advertisements
 unka prachaar sandarbhheen dikhaai detaa he
 "where is the basic work that must be done to build a brand of Rahul Rahul, compared to Modi, that too has not happened in the case of Rahul in view of the general elections starting from 7 April
" unka prachaar disambar 2013 se shuru hua jabaki us samay tak modi kaa prachaar apni raftaar pakad chukaa tha
 Nobody in the party set on dynasty dares to give Rahul the right advice
 goswami ko die ghante bhar ke intervyuu ke pehle bhi shaayad yahi hua
 Many in the party openly admit that giving interviews was a huge mistake
 desai kehete hai, ''aise mahatvapurn samay main 80 minute kaa intervyuu dena badi chook thi
 It should have been made smaller and impressive
 ”bich-bich main rahul kaa ubaal asangat or kai baar bachakaana maaloom hota he
 Whether it is to tear the bill protecting the convicted mps as rubbish or to enact an anti-corruption law through the ordinance, all these antics show their inexperience
 congress ke liye janalokapal bill andolan kaa phayda uthaane kaa acha avasar tha
 Desai says, "he was presented this opportunity by serving it on a plate
" lekin unhone uskaa laabh uthaane main bahut der kar di
 "when compared to Modi, Modi's past record as an administrator in Gujarat has been good, Rahul has nothing to show for his work in the last 10 years except the changes he has made in the Youth Congress
 kidawai kehete hai, ''unke paas safalataa kii koi kahani nahin he
 "he says that Rahul's father, the late Rajiv Gandhi", when he became Prime Minister, was younger than Rahul
 do bacchon ke pita the or ek naukareepesha vyakti the
 Although initially he was hesitant to take responsibility, but after taking responsibility, he was fully involved in his work
 ” party karyaalay main rahul kii gaiyr-maujuudagi or sansad kii bahason main kabhi-kabhaar hi dikhaai dena party ke yuva kaadaron ke liye bhi acha sanket nahin detaa
 Rahul, who likes technology, is not active at all on social media
 'frends of congress’ naam ke sanghathan ne jab unase twitor par aane kaa anurodh kiya to unhone use bhi ansuna kar diya
 By doing so, they have missed opportunities through which they could give voters a glimpse of their ideas
 marketing main kejariwal agservind kejariwal ne badi chaturaai se aam aadmi party kaa brands taiyaar kiya
 He has achieved this feat in a year by making his debut from zero
 desai kehete hai, ''yah joardaar idia he, jo sabko prabhavit kar rahaa he, chaahe vah party kaa chunaav chinh jhaadu ho yaa uski topi
 "kejriwal looks sweaty in the pictures, which gives the message that he is a working man
 modi tasveeron main ek majboot shaasha najar aate hai, jabaki rahul bhramit dikhaai dete hai
 They have not succeeded in removing their 'baba' (rich and influential house child) image
 rahul kuliyon, mahilaon, rickshaw-chaalkon or chaatro ke saath choti-choti sabhaayen kar rahe hai
 They want to show that they are not leaders sitting on the stage, but want to be among the people
 khud ko satta se dur rahane vaale netaa ke taur par pesh karne kii unki ranneeti brands ke jaankaar logon ko sahi nahin lag rahi he
 The biggest problem in building Rahul's brand is his introvert
 parfect relations ke cherian kehete hai, ''rahul swabhaav se nitant ekaaki hai
 They talk openly with some of their close ones
 lekin aise kareebi logon kii sankhya bahut kam he
 "modi, on the contrary, has given him the brand of discussion on tea and has taken advantage of Indians' habit of drinking tea
 is charchaa ke madhyam se ve badi chaturaai se yah bhi dikhaa rahe hai ki bijepi kaa yah netaa kaise ek chaay bechney vaale se uthakar is oonchai tak pahunch gaya he
 Congress insiders say that in the next phase of campaigning for Rahul and the party, special sections will be targeted
 lekin tab tak to brands rahul viraasat or asamanjas ke bhavar main hi fansaa rahane vaala he
 SKA Advisors Chairman Sunil Alag says, "rahul Gandhi is such a product saying that i am in the process of R&D right now
 modi chaay-biscuit vaale aadmi hai, jo hamaari roj kii jindagi kaa hissaa he
 Rahul Gandhi is a chocolate biscuit brand, and today i don't need chocolate
 ” The encounter with militants outside the Indian consulate in the Afghan city of mazar-e-sharif finally came to an end on Monday night
 25 ghanton tak chali is muthbhed main suraksha balon ne sabhi aatankiyon ke maar giraaya
 Terrorists who tried to enter the embassy tried to sneak inside the Indian embassy
 is ghatana main koi hataahat nahin hua he
 The consulate was attacked Sunday night by a group of terrorists
 ve imaarat main ghusna chaahate the, lekin surakshabalon ne unke iraadon ko naakaam kar diya
 Three terrorists who were killed in installments were killed on Sunday night while the rest were shelled the next day
 bharat sarkaar ke ek sutara ne kaha, 'afgaan adhikariyon ne abhiyaan khatm hone kii pushti kar di he
 According to AFP, provincial police spokesperson Syed Kamal Sadat said, "the cleanliness (of the terrorists) operation is over and all terrorists have been killed
" ' kuch khabaron main kaha gaya ki hamalaavaron main se ek ko jivit pakad liya gaya, lekin isaki koi pushti nahin ho pai he
 Benefit of the terrorists' mistake, official sources said, the terrorists attacked from a marriage hall located 100 meters from the embassy
 unka nishaanaa duutavas hi tha lekin aatankiyon ne galati se paas vaali ek manzil par hamalaa kar diya
 This led ITBP commandos to retaliate against the terrorists
 purv main aadhikarik sutron ne kaha tha ki afgaan neshnal police kii vishesh ladaaku ikaayiyon ne bhartiya vaanijya duutavas ke baahar se teen shav baraamad kiye
 The rocket launcher is also at 9 pm from 9 pm on Sunday night
 15 baje tak ITBP ke commando ne aatankwaadiyon par baari golibari kii
 Sources say that at least seven rocket propelled grenades were fired towards the embassy but all missed the target
 raat kareeb 12 baje suraksha balon nebhartiya vaanijya duutavasako bachaa liya
 Modi spoke to the Afghan President on a phone call between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday evening and Modi told Ghani that India is always standing with the people of Afghanistan
 gani ne modi ko ghatana ke bare main jaankaree di or modi ne aatanki iraadon ko naakaam karne main afgaan neshnal police dwaara dikhaai gai bahaduree or saahas kii tarif kii
