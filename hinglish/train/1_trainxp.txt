 Exclusive information on the hand of India Today shows how an uproar took place within the party throughout the day
 pesh he tafsil:-ravivaar subah kumaar vishwaas ne arvind kejariwal ko phone kiya or bataaya ki wo unase milane aa rahe hai
 Vishwas was in Indore at that time
 dilli lautate hi wo airport se sidhe apni patni ke saath kejariwal se milane pahunche
 As soon as they arrived, Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and Kumar went to a separate room for Vishwas
 kuch der baad sanjay singh or ashutosh bhi baithak main shaamil ho gaye
 These five questions are also necessary to ask Kapil Mishra? Click to read - Kumar Vishwas first asked the reason for Mishra's dismissal
 wo is ection se khafa the
 To this, Manish Sisodia asked if he could accept Mishra's recent tweets? He was presented with a report on the defeat in the MCD elections in which about 50 party mlas termed the water crisis in his circles as the reason for the defeat
 -kumaar vishwaas ne mana kikapil mishra ko twitor par sawaal uthaane ke bajaaeparty forum par shikaayat kerani chahie thi
 Sanjay Singh and Manish Sisodia told Kumar Vishwas that if Kapil were to disclose the tanker scam, he was free to do so
 lekin unhen kejariwal se milane kii juthi baat kehane kii kya jarurat thi?-kumaar vishwaas ne kejariwal se poocha ki kya wo is silsile main kapil mishra se mili the? kejariwal ne is baat se inkaar kiya
 He said that he was hurt by Mishra lying in public
 kejariwal ne ye bhi kaha ki party or piesi maanati he ki cabinet main koun rahegaa, is baat kaa aakhri faisla sirf mukhyamantri kar sakate hai
 On this, Kumar Vishwas replied that this decision could be taken later by taking Mishra in confidence
 -iske baad kumaar vishwaas baithak se chale gaye
 He said that he would talk to Kapil Mishra
 ab tak subah ke 11 baj chuke the
 After a while, he returned from Kejriwal's house through the back door
 -kumaar vishwaas ke jane ke baad gopal raay, satyendra jain or dilip pandey baithak main shaamil ho gaye
 On this occasion, Kumar Vishwas told the leaders involved in the meeting that he was not able to talk to Kapil
 -iske baad baithak main shaamil netaaon ne tivi par kapil ke aarope sune
 Everyone was shocked at Mishra's statement
 bifere hue vishwaas ne kaha ki wo kapil mishra ke aaropon par katai yakeen nahin kar sakate
 After some discussion, Kumar Vishwas admitted that Kapil Mishra has exceeded his limits
 manish sisodiya ne poocha ki kya mishra kaa bayaan amanatulla ke aaropon jitna hi sanjeeda nahin he? kya koi bhi party netaa kejariwal ke khilaaf in beja aaropon par yakeen kar saktaa he?-kumaar vishwaas manish sisodiya kii baat se sahamat the
 He said that he was not so hurt by Amanatullah's allegations as well
 unke mutabik matbhedon ke baavjood wo kejariwal ke bare main aisi baat soch bhi nahin sakate
 Kejriwal told the leaders that there is no need to answer Mishra's allegations
 haalanki wo hairaan hai ki kapil mishra is had tak gir sakate hai
 -kumar was advised not to give a statement on this issue
 lekin kumaar vishwaas ne kaha ki is maukey par jaruri he ki party ekasur main sandesh de
 So they will give a statement
 -kumaar vishwaas ne ye bhi kaha ki satyendra jain ke khilaaf lage aaropon par bhi sanjidagi se vichaar hona chahie
 In his opinion, the party and leadership cannot be seen defending a leader who has even the slightest stain of corruption
 unhone satyendra jain se kaha ki wo piesi kii agali baithak main apane bachaav main dastavej pesh karen
 After this, the final decision will be made about Satyendra Jain
 -party netaa is baat par ekamat the ki kapil mishra ne apni hadein langhi hai
 But there was no talk about action on them
 - is maukey par kumaar vishwaas jajbaati ho gaye
 He reiterated that no matter what happens, he cannot believe that Kejriwal is corrupt
 -kumaar vishwaas ne ye bhi kaha ki agar samarthakon ko ye lagata he ki party ke bheetar dhade ek duusare par waar kar rahe hai to ye aatmghaatee hoga
 Therefore, there should be no action against anyone till the leadership is established
 -sanjay singh ne kumaar vishwaas se poocha ki kapil mishra ye kyon nahin bataate ki unhone kab kejariwal ko 2 karod rupee lete dekha tha? unki raay main sisitivi footage se is baat kii tasdik honi chahie
 He said that Mishra should tell which of the relatives of Kejriwal from Satyendra Jain has helped in the land deal
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki mishra party ko khatm karne kii sajeesh kar rahe hai
 Kumar Vishwas reiterated that this cannot be tolerated

 Russia has called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) a tense organization
 rus kaa kahana he ki yah apane astitv main rahane kii vajah talashta rahata he or is kram main tanaav paidaa karata rahata he

 Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI and Hafiz Saeed, who are sitting in Pakistan, are always hatching new conspiracies
 khufia sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, pakistan ab lashkar ke aatankiyon ko fund muhaiyaa karaane ke liye nai chaal chal rahaa he
 According to sources, Lashkar currently has a shortage of funds due to international pressure
 fund jutaney ke liye hafiz said ne PAK adhikrut kashmir main chal rahe iconomic coridor yani sipiisi project main apane technocrate lagaakar paise kamaane kaa plan taiyaar kiya he
 For this, Hafiz Saeed has appointed 26 / 11 mastermind Abdul Rahman Makki as a professor with the help of ISI
 jo PAK adhikrut kashmir ke alag-alag ilaakon main 300 technocrate yani lashkar or jamaat-ud-daawa ke logon ko trend karegaa
 After the course has been conducted, they have been asked to work in the Pakistan Economic Corridor being built with the help of China
 300 pakistani ejeeniyar jinhen aane vaale dinon main back door se china ke dwaara banaae ja rahe sipiisi project main bhartee karaayaa jayega
 Through this a part of the money will be given to jamaat-ud-dawa and lashkar-e-taiba
 bataa den ki lashkar in dinon pakistani ejiniers ke batch ko management course kara rahaa he
 According to the agencies, Abdul Rahman Makki, the Lashkar terrorist and mastermind of the Mumbai attack, has been given the responsibility to conduct this course of Lashkar
 course karne ke baad in ejeeniyar ko lashkar ke ek or centre abtabad main bheja jayega
 Where they will be given some months of physical training
 course karaae jane ke baad inhen china kii madad se ban rahe pakistan iconomic coridor yani sipiisi main naukari karne ko kaha gaya he
 300 Pakistani engineers have been asked to join CPEC, who have undergone training from terrorist organizations
 yahi nahin pakistan kii khufia agency iesai hafiz said ke jamaat-ud-daawa ko puri shah dene ke liye kai kadam uthaa rahaa he
 According to the information, Pakistan is helping jamaat-ud-dawa and lashkar-e-taiba to raise funds by creating small trusts
 haal hi main jamaat-ud-daawa ne kai chote- chote trust (al imam naam kaa trust banaaya he) banaakar kashmir main aatank failaane ke liye paisa juta rahaa he
 In fact, due to international pressure, many of the jamaat-ud-dawa trusts in Pakistan have economic restrictions
 jiske chalate naa to usase paisa nikaal saktaa he or naa hi kahin paisa bhej saktaa he
 This is the reason why Hafiz Saeed and his henchmen are trying to raise money by creating new small trusts

 That too in the race for an international level

 bjp's PM candidate and 'controversial Hindu nationalist' in the words of the Times, Narendra Modi is currently running second
 mangalvaar ko vah sabase aage the lekin buudhvaar ko singer-actor mili sires or america kii internet jasusi kaa khulaasa karne vaale edward snowden se pichhadakar tisare number par khisak gaye
 But after the aggressive Facebook campaign of the brothers, Modi has regained the second position
 unhen ab tak 13
 Got 8% votes
 ab sthiti kuch is tarah he,mili sires:26
 8% Narendra Modi: 13
 8 %abdel fatah al-sisi:9
 3% Edward Snowden: 8
 5 %kal tak fasebuk-twitor ke galiyaaron main charchaa thi ki rahul gandhi ko is daud main shaamil na kiye jane se kongi bandhu aahat hai
 Now they have very little work left to do on the social site
 mangalvaar tak ve itnaa to samaj gaye ki modi ko jeetne se rokane ke liye unhen kisi or ko dhadadhad vot karne honge
 But to whom, Snowden or Cyrus, they seemed confused with it
 lekin taaja rujhaanon se lagata he ki kanfusion kii rekhaaen mit gai hai
 Congressmen have also taken this race on Ego
 twitor par vyangy ke zyaadaatar suurama likh rahe hai ki anti-modi vot ab mili sires ke hisse ja rahaa he
 Hence Snowden's vote has fallen sharply and he has slipped to fourth
 4 disambar tak yah res chalegi
 If Modi loses, what is the need to celebrate some internal celebrations in Lutyens' zone? note: yah khabar un logon ke hawaale se likhi gai he jo fasebuk-twitor par anand le rahe hai
 Take it lightly, it will remain light

 a youth living in Dadri, Gautam Budh Nagar was murdered by unknown miscreants
 yuvak kaa naam anshul tha
 He left the house saying that he should go to Jagran
 lekin agali subah wo ghar nahin lautaa balki uski laash uske ghar pahunchi
 The family members of Anshul present in Dadri are in a bad state
 unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki aakhir kisne or kyon anshul kihatyaki he
 The family members of Anshul told the police that around 8 o'clock in the night, Ashunl said that he was going to Jagran held near the house and would come back after two hours till ten o'clock in the night
 lekin anshul jab raat ke baarah baje tak ghar waapas nahin lautaa to uske gharavaale jaagran main pahunche
 They started searching for Anshul but after going there, they found that no one had seen Anshul in Jagran
 iske baad puri raat anshul ke gharavaale or uske dost use dhundte rahe
 Police was also informed about the disappearance of Anshul
 lekin police bhi anshul ko dhund nahin pai
 The next morning, the family members of Anshul found out that the dead body of a young man was lying in the nearby forest, when the family members went and saw that the body was that of Anshul
 police kaa kahana he ki dekhakar lag rahaa he ki anshul kii hatya galaa dabaakar kii gai he
 But for what purpose, who carried out the incident, it is not clear
 anshul ke paas koi keemtee saamaan bhi nahin tha
 So the police seems less likely to suspect that the murder may have been committed for looting
 ab police anshul ke tamaam doston se bhi poochtacha kar rahi he

 Hooda's strong face and caste equations came Kamashok Tanwar could not win a single election in 6 years
 Congress has made a big change in the Haryana Congress just before the election of the dalit-jat equation in Haryana
 purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda kii congress chhodane kii dhamkee kaam ai
 The Congress high command has handed over the command of the state president from Ashok Tanwar to former Union Minister Kumari Selja
 congress sheersh netritv ne hooda ko haryana vidhansabha chunaav main chunaav abhiyaan cameti kaa chairman or congress vidhayak dal ke adhyaksh banane kaa faisla kiya he
 Clearly, the Congress has decided to enter the electoral arena with the face of Bhupendra Hooda
 congress pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar or purv mukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ke bich lagaataar takaraav jari tha or jiskaa khamiyaja loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi party ke safaaye ke rup main saamne aayaa
 After this, Bhupendra Singh Hooda was constantly pressurizing the Congress president to change in Haryana and for some months there was a feeling from his attitude that if the high command did not listen, he can also cut his way
 varisht patrkaar shakeel akhtar kehete hai ki ashok tanvar pradesh adhyaksh ke taur par puri tarah se fail rahe hai
 The Congress could not win a single election under his leadership
 itnaa hi nahin tanvar apane dalit samudaay ko bhi congress ke saath jodakar rakh paane main asafal rahe he
 Whereas in the politics of Haryana, the Congress has no bigger face than Bhupendra Singh Hooda
 isi maddenjar hooda ko vidhansabha main congress vidhayak dal kaa netaa or rajya chunaav samiti kaa adhyaksh banaakar haryana ke jaaton ko saadhane kii bhi koshish kii he
 Ashok Tanwar was given the command of the Congress in Haryana in February ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when the Congress was in power in Haryana
 tanvar ke netritv main 2014 or 2019 do loksabhaa or ek vidhansabha chunaav hue, lekin ek bhi chunaav vah congress ko nahin jita sake
 Since 2014, the Congress graph has steadily declined in Haryana
 iskaa nateeja rahaa ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress pradesh main khaataa bhi nahin khol saki
 Senior journalist Arvind Singh says that Congress President Sonia Gandhi has not only convinced Hooda but has also taken the bet to keep the traditional Dalit support base of Congress with her by changing the leadership in Haryana Pradesh Congress and handing over the command to Kumari Selja
 singh kehete hai ki hooda jamini or janaadhar vaale netaa hone ke saath-saath unke paas saare sansaadhan hai
 Hooda also has better relations with the top Congress leaders, due to which he has managed to get his say to Sonia
 arvind singh kehete hai ki rahul gandhi ke chalate ashok tanvar pichley chah saalon se haryana congress adhyaksh bane rahe, lekin is dauraan na to vah sanghathan khadaa kar sake or na hi apni jati ko party ke paksh main ekajute kar sake
 The same thing has gone against him
 jabaki hooda 18 agast ko rohtak main raily karke apni takat ke congress netritv ko sandesh dene main safal rahe
 At the same time, by upsetting Hooda, the Congress did not want to give the name of being anti-jat
 yahi baat hooda ko majboot karne kaam kiya he
 Through Hooda and Shailaja in Haryana, the Congress will try to form a strong alliance of Jats and Dalits in Haryana politics
 chautaala parivaar kii aapasi ladaai kii vajah se haryana ke 30 fisadi jaaton kii pehali pasand ab bhupendra singh hooda ban sakate hai
 Also, the popularity of Kumari Selja and her father in about 20 percent of the Dalit population of the state can unite the traditional Dalit support base of the Congress
 isi raajnneetik sameekaran ko dekhte hue sonia gandhi ko tanvar ko hataane or hooda kii sharton ko maanane ke liye majaboor hona padaa he

 deepawali ke bare main hindu dharm main yah manyata he ki treta yug main is din bhagwaan ram 14 varsh ke vanvaas or ravan kaa vadh karne ke baad ayodhya laute the
 In this joy Ayodhya residents celebrated the entire city by lighting it with the light of lamps and in this way the festival of Deepawali started to be celebrated

 Among them, Bhupen Hazarika and Nanaji Deshmukh will be given this honor posthumously

 At that time there was also a section in the Congress party that did not want Mukherjee to participate in the Sangh program
 haalanki, in baton ke baavjood mukherjee nagpur gaye the
 As far as the matter is about Bhupen Hazarika

 In such a situation, by giving Bhupen the country's highest civilian honor, the BJP has saluted the regional identity of Assam in a way

 team india ke of spinner raviuundan aswin ne badi hi bebaaki se mana ki gend fenkate vakt isisi ke 15 degree tak haath ke modane ke niyam kaa istemaal unhone apane faayde ke liye kiya he
 They say that it is not their job to make rules, but if there is a rule then why should i not use it in my own right in this very competitive time? lekin bhartiya team ke purv of spinner sarandeep singh kehete hai ki aswin ko saavdhaan rahanaa chahie
 Because rules can be availed
 lekin ek baar jab of spinner ko maar padane lagati he to gendbaaz iskaa baraabar istemaal kar saktaa he
 In such a situation, there can be mistake of going beyond the rules
 isisi ke niyam 24 kii dhara 3 ke mutabik gend daalate vakt jab haath kandhe tak pahunchataa he to vahaan se gend fenkate samay haath kohni ke jod se 15 degree se zyaada nahin mudana chahie
 Although initially these rules are 10 degrees for fast bowlers, 7 for medium pacers
 5 degree or spinners ke liye 5 degree tak kaa tha lekin baad main spinners ko 15 degree tak kohni modane kii chhot de di gai
 Ashwin from Chennai is one of the bowlers whose bowling action is considered clean
 lekin maujuuda niyam ke 15 degree tak hone kaa wo bhi faaydaa uthaa rahe hai
 Ashwin is sympathetic to the players who commit such mistakes and who are banned
 unhen lagata he ki agar koi khilaadi training lekar of spinner banataa he or us par achaanak sazaa sunai jaati he to unhen bahut dukh hota he
 Ashwin is deeply saddened by the speculation about his relationship with Harbhajan Singh
 25 test main 124 or 99 vanade main 139 wicket le chuke aswin kehete hai ki harbhajan singh unke role model hua karte the
 Ashwin, 28, says that he used to bowl moderately fast with the new ball and used to bat openings
 lekin chot ke baad unhone spin gendbaazi ko apana liya
 He recalls Bhajji's adventures in 2001 (when Ashwin was 14) and says that Turbonator's exploits against World Champion Australia have convinced him of the art of spin

 According to party sources, many sitting mlas and other party leaders in Gujarat are also in touch with the party
 vahiin aam aadmi party kaa kahana he ki gujarat main vipaksh behad kamjor he or aise main maujuuda sarkaar ke khilaaf naaraazgi ke baad nai party ke liye kaaphi ummid he
 Gujarat is the stronghold of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP
 jahaan se wo 3 baar mukhyamantri rahe
 In such a situation, Arvind Kejriwal will now challenge Modi in his stronghold

 gahare hare rang kii sari pahane hue je
 Jayalalithaa sworn in as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for the fourth time on 23 May
 kuch utsaahi logon ne unhen naam diya he puraachi talavi yani krantikari netaa
 So this revolutionary leader has just got his political rival DMK chief M
K
 karunanidhi ke baraabar pahunchane ke liye ek baar or chunaav jitkar mukhyamantri kii kursi tak pahunchnaa hoga
 However, in this list of victory, he was his mentor and guide M
 ji
 She has left behind Ramachandran, who has won the Assembly elections three times in a row and has been Chief Minister for the entire decade since 1977 to 1987
 agarache 2011 ke mukaable ammaa ko siten kuch kam milin, lekin jeet aasaan or mukammal rahi or mjiaar ke baad yah pehali baar hua he ki tamilnadu kii janata ne pehle se kursi par virajman mukhyamantri ko hi dobaaraa kursi tak pahunchaa diya
 Jayalalithaa's swearing-in ceremony was also grand
 jane-maane sitaron, kadamon main sir jhukaae bhakton ke alaava diemke netaa or karunanidhi ke bete em
 K
 stallin bhi samaaroh main maujuud the
 However, the market of whispers in the media over the seating arrangement was hot as Stalin's seating seat was far from the main location
 jaahir he ki stallin ke pita ko bura laga or unhone jayalalita par jaan-boojhkar apamaanit karne kaa aarope bhi madh diya
 With the completion of the oath form, Jayalalithaa engaged directly in the work
 or paanch mahatvapurn filon par hastakshar kiye
 One of these immediate decisions was to forgive crop loans of small and medium farmers, which Amma had promised in the elections
 fasal karj maaf karnaa ek aisa faisla tha, jise janata kaa apaar samarthan mila
 Jayalalithaa is adept at making big decisions — waiving debt, free electricity, gold, and 50% off scooters for working women
 pichley paanch saalon main tamilnadu kii arthvyavastha 6
 It has grown at an average rate of 5 per cent, but this pace is not predictable
 varsh 2016-17 ke rajya ke bajet main rajkoshiya ghaataa 9,000 karod ru
 Of which is almost double of last financial year
 tamilnadu ke jidipi (sakal gharelu utpaada) ke anupaat main rajkoshiya ghaataa lagaataar bad rahaa he
 2 of the total GDP in 2012-13
 2 fisadi tha, vah 2015-16 main badhkar 2
 Reached 9 percent
 haalanki yah sankhya vitt ayog ke sujhaaye gaye 3 fisadi ke rajkoshiya ghate ke aankade se paar nahin gai he
 But now it is the next new phase of subsidies and free gifts
 agle vitt varsh main free bijli or saatven vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lagu karne ke saath rajkosh par dabaav badhane vaala he or yah baat arthshaastriyon ke liye chintaa kaa sabab bani hui he
 Former Director of Madras School of Economics Drs
 paul appaswami kehete hai, ‘‘gramin ilaakon main or shahari garib aabaadi ke liye kalyankari yojanaon kaa makasad aarthik vikaas ke phaayde or ek hisse ko un logon tak pahunchaana he
 But on the one hand, when the economy of the nation and the state is going down, in such a situation, these schemes will have a negative impact on the development and financial condition of the state
 ’’ saamaajik kaaryakarta em
 Yes
 devsahaayam kehete hai, ‘‘hamen apni maansikta badalane kii jarurat he
 If we really want good days then we need to be free from this free culture
 ’’tamilnadu kii is tathakthith muft kii samskruti ko lagaataar jayalalita ke khilaaf ek hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Union Minister of State for Power Piyush Goyal blames both the DMK and AIADMK for the power shortage
 jayalalita ke shabdon main tamilnadu ‘‘atirikt bijli vaala rajya’’ he
 It is possible that this may have been true at some point, but today's reality is something else
 aaj rajya ke bahut bade hisse main kai-kai ghanton kii bijli katautee hoti he, jiskaa udyogon par padane vaala nakaaratmak prabhaav kaaphi ghaatak he
 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh says that with the same amount of money the two big parties of Tamil Nadu spend on distributing gifts to the people, "25,000 schools can be found in the state"
 ’’siton kii sankhya ke lihaaj se tamilnadu vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey nirnaayak rahe hai, lekin voton kii sankhya ke lihaaj se mahaj ek fisadi kaa faasla he eiediemke or uski virdohi party ke bich main
 The dmk's leaf was cleared in the last elections, but this time it has emerged as a strong opposition
 sankhya or siyaasi anubhav, donon lihaaj se tamilnadu kii kisi sarkaar ne shaayad hi aise majboot vipaksh kaa saamana kiya ho
 Jayalalithaa has just won a resounding victory in the elections and is now gearing up confidently to face the opposition
 aankadon ko apane paksh main modate hue 2014 ke aam chunaavon main 39 main se 37 loksabhaa siten jayalalita ne eiediemke ke paksh main kar lee thim
 That victory strengthened his confidence
 apana naam ujagar na karne kii shart par eiediemke ke ek purv mantri bataate hai, ‘‘eiediemke main jo bhi hota he, ammaa kii marji se hota he
 We win or lose in their name
 ’’ haalanki ve badi tatparta se yah bhi kehane se nahin chookte ki yah sirf khushaamad bhar nahin haih jayalalita ke paas ‘suniyojit ranneeti he
 Amma's promise to women, for example, proved to be very effective, such as gold, two-wheeler discounts and maternity support
 jin chunaav kshetron main mahila matadaataaon kii sankhya purushon se adhik thi, vahaan eiediemke ke voton main 62 fisadi tak kaa ijapha hua
 But there is a big difference between governance and electoral strategy
 ‘‘vijan 2023’’ document main naukari, infrastracchar, udyogon or vikaas kii ruparekha he
 This is an ambitious document
 2019 ke aam chunaavon se pehle rashtriya str par apane rajnatik kad or mahatv ko badhaane ke vaaste jayalalita ke haath main dikhaane ke liye kuch to thos kaam or parinaam hone chahie
 However, now the ball is in his court
 abhi ve jo karengi, usee se tay hoga ki ve bataur netaa karunanidhi or mjiaar se aage ja paaengi yaa nahin

 darasal, somvaar ko vidhansabha main floor test hona he aise main agar baagi vidhayak sarkaar ke paksh main vot nahin karte hai to echdi kumaraswami kii sarkaar kaa ye aakhri din hoga
 That is why efforts are being made by the Congress and JDS to save the government
 aise main kumaraswami ke liye mukhyamantri pad tyaag kar sarkaar bachaana aakhri rasta ho saktaa he
 Significantly, when the mlas started resigning from the Congress in early July, there was a crisis on the government
 lekin kuch hi din baad jab maan-manouvval kaa daur chalaa to ek awaz saamne ai thi
 In which 4 MLA out of the rebel mlas said that if Siddaramaiah takes charge of the state, he can withdraw his decision and support the government
 bataa den ki baagi vidhayakon ko hataakar congress-jedies kii sarkaar ke paas 100 kaa aankada he, jo bahumat se dur he
 But if the rebel MLA is considered as the Chief Minister of the Congress, then the way to escape the government can also be cleared
 2018 main jab karnataka main chunaav hue to congress bahumat se dur rah gai thi, lekin BJP ko dur karne ke liye congress-jds saath ai or kumaraswami kaa mukhyamantri bananaa tay hua
 Despite being half the MLA from the Congress, the Chief Minister became JDS but some of the Congress Chief Ministers did not like it

 The flames of violence arising from Greater Noida soon turned to Agra

 In protest against the Yamuna Expressway, farmers set fire to the private builder's office and threw stones at the police

 On Sunday, farmers set fire to the Yamuna Expressway office against land acquisition
 iske baad hinsa kii aag bhadki to police or siarpief ke jawan maukey se bhaagane lage
 In fact, the team of Yamuna Expressway project reached the spot in Chaugan village of Agra
 sadak banane ke liye ilaake khaali karaae ja rahe the or maukey par todphod kii ja rahi thi, lekin isse gaanvvaalon kaa gussa bhadak gaya
 The people of the village were running the police with sticks
 pulisavaalon ko kuch log lathi se maar rahe the, to kuch log pathar barasaa rahe the
 Some policemen were injured in the farmers' attack, but the villagers were taken hostage by those who could not escape in this chaos

 On the second day of the violent clash, the police personnel went out in search of the accused in the village and went on setting fire in the people's fields
 gaanvvaalon kaa kahana he ki pulisavaalon ne ye bhi nahin dekha ki wo aaropee kaa nuksaan kar rahe hai yaa aam logon kaa
 Anyone who came to the front to stop the fire was beaten badly

 The elderly are also crying over their situation
 shanivaar ko muaavje kii maang ko lekar gaanvvaalon ne roadways ke teen karmchaariyon ko bandhak bana liya tha
 After this, the district administration reached Greater Noida with about two thousand PAC jawans, but the farmers got angry after seeing such a large number of soldiers
 police or javaanon ke bich jab ghamaasan shuru hua to teen ghante tak kisi ke roke nahin rukaa
 In this bloody game played for the ground, Gautam Budhnagar DM Deepak Aggarwal was also shot in the leg and he somehow escaped from the spot

 The information given by Mehta to the Supreme Court recently about the Taj Mahal is worrying - if we are not serious about saving the Taj, it may soon turn into ruins
 imaarat main daraaren dikhne lagi hai
 The towers are starting to bow down
 deevaaron se pathar or duusari chijen jhadakar aksar gir padati hai
 Abundant poison has dissolved in water and air, the result of which is that the whitewash of marble is now turning from light yellow to brown
 aasapaas ke ilaake main avaidh atikaraman bahut zyada he, sisitivi kaam nahin karte or taj ke aasapaas ke saare naale jam ho chuke hai
 And Yamuna, who is taking care of the Taj, is dying, which is putting a serious threat on the foundation of the tomb
 nadi kii gandagi main paidaa hone vaale keede lakhon kii taadaad main imaarat par jaakar baithte hai use ganda kar rahe hai
 It seems as if evergreen gazal written on stone has now become the home of diseases
 ''aap taj ko band kar sakate hai
 You can also demolish it if you want
 aap chahen to isse pallaa bhi jhaad sakate hai
 Hearing Mehta's plea, this desperate comment of the Supreme Court bench regarding the Taj Mahal tells the whole story of the plight of 'this great wonder of the world' and its carelessness over its preservation
 duniya ke anya prasiddh smarakon ko bhi sangrakshan se judi aisi chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 a thick layer of soot was also added to the Colosseum in Rome by the smoke of trains running on the streets of the city, and three years of renovation efforts took place to revive it
 tab jaakar haal hi main ise punah vyavasthit kiya gaya he
 UNESCO, the World Heritage Monitoring Organization like the Taj, recommends an integrated management plan to maintain the current state of the monuments, especially for the correct management of the pressure on buildings due to the large number of tourists
 There should be proper implementation
 baharhaal taj kii pareshaani mahaj ise nazarandaaj karne se kahin badhkar he
 This is the story of how disinterested we are about protecting the environment and our heritage
 taj kahata he ki hamamen to paryaton kii apni apaar sambhaavnaaon kaa istemaal karke paise kamaane kii sahi kaabiliyat bhi nahin he
 One crore tourists visited India last year
 singapore, jiske paas taj kaa dur-dur tak muqabla karne ke kaabil ek imaarat bhi nahin he, vahaan 17 lakh sailaani aae the
 In this special issue the cover story 'save the Taj' prepared by Executive Editor Damayanti Dutta attempts to underline that the ravaged waste management, pollution, insect-moths and wild crowds of tourists, for this great wonder of the world How the irony has become haunted and its existence is in danger
 yah galatiyon, tandra, upeksha, kuprabandhan ke aparaadhon, adoordarshita or saaf taur par laaparvaahee kii ek dukhad kahani he
 It is the monument with which the world sees India connecting
 aksar jab aap kisi ko bataate hai ki aap bharat se hai, to ve swatah hi bol padate hai- jahaan 'taj mahal' he
 The Taj has successfully withstood many rulers, natural disasters and wars in India for 370 years
 jaise bharat ke duusare smarak nasht ho rahe hai usee tarah nasht hone ke liye ham 'vishwa ke is mahaan aashcharya' ko nasht hone ke liye kaise chhod sakate hai? maine darjanon baar taj kaa didaar kiya he or har baar yah mujhe achambhit kar detaa he
 We cannot become that generation of people who would simply let the beauty of this great monument be destroyed
 is saptaah se india today group apane sabhi plateform par # savethetaj abhiyaan launch karegaa
 Every week, we will put a big problem related to this in front of everyone
 main aap sabhi se is abhiyaan main shaamil hone kaa aagrah karata hum
 Send us your thoughts on how we can protect this magnificent building
 yah ek adbhut dharodhar he jise hamen sangrakshit karnaa hoga
 If we don't do this, this world will not forgive us

 mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh ke lagaataar bad rahe maamalon se puraa desh chintit he
 In such a situation, social activist Swami Agnivesh has said that if people stop consuming non-vegetarian and alcohol, then there will be a decrease in rape cases
 agnivesh ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘ham balaatkaar jaise aparaadh ko sirf police ke jariye nahin roak sakate
 i believe that if people stop eating meat, there will be a big reduction in the incidence of rape
 is par bahut se anusandhan hue hai
 If alcohol consumption is stopped, there will be significant reduction in rape cases
 ’ agnivesh ne kaha ki bahut se aparaadh or haadase sharaab pine se hote hai
 Regarding the importance of vegetarianism, Agnivesh said that Japanese scientists recently conducted a study on the oldest person on Earth and found that he was a vegetarian
 unhone kaha, ‘is duniya main hua har research yah bataata he ki bakre kaa maance (red meet) sabhi bimariyon kii jad he
 Agnivesh said that all the 6 accused of barbaric gang-rape of a girl in a moving bus in Delhi on the night of 16 December last year had drunk alcohol and even the accused of raping a 5-year-old girl recently drank alcohol was
 unhone kaha, ‘donon maamalon main aropiyon ne sharaab pi rakhi thi
 It is clear that he committed the crime due to alcoholism
 sharaab aadmi kii naitik soch ko khatm kar detii he
 Agnivesh said, "the government is not stopping the production of liquor because it gives revenue
" sabhi rajyon main ab sharaab utpaadan ke maamle main ek-duusare se aage nikalne kii hode shuru ho gai he
 It has become a trend
 ’ is tathy par chintaa jataate hue ki har roj ek arab pashuon kaa vadh kiya jaataa he, unhone kaha, ‘iske gambhir parinaam honge
 Asked if the death penalty would stop rape incidents, Agnivesh said, "the death penalty will do nothing
" main iskaa samarthan nahin karata
 No one should be given the death penalty, even those who attack Parliament

 Let us now know who are those brave sons who sacrificed their lives for us and you
 pehle baat nayak niraj kumaar singh kii
 It was August last year
 kupwada ke jangalon main aatankiyon ke jabardast golabari ke chapet main nayak niraj kaa saathi aa gaya
 Not caring for his life, the hero Neeraj saved his companion
 ek aatanki ne niraj ke upar grenade phenkaa or baari golabari karne laga
 Showing great courage, Neeraj went close to the terrorist and shot him 
 usee dauraan ek-duusare aatanki ne us par hamalaa kiya jisase unki rifl jameen par gir gai or seene main goli lag gai
 In spite of being badly wounded, he showed indomitable courage and captured the terrorist and snatched his weapon and eventually killed him
 jab tak wo hosh main rahe maidan chhodane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Fainted, he was evicted from there, but by then he had lost his life
 nayak niraj ke do bete hai
 His wife Padmeshwari Devi wept while remembering her husband and says, "I am glad i got this award, but it would have been better if he had been
" padmeshwari devi ye bhi kahati hai ki bachche to samajhate hai ki papa duty par hai
 The younger son himself insists on going into the army himself and i would also like my two children to go in the army
 vahiin, major mukunda varadarajan ko jab pichley saal 25 april ko kashmir ke shopiyaan main khabar mili kii ek gaanv main teen aatanki chhipe hai
 He left with the team as soon as the news was received oparation kaa netritv karte hue us ghar main ghuse jahaan aatanki chhipe the
 Killed the terrorist hiding in the room with a grenade
 jabaki us vakt aatankiyon ke saathiyon ne un par jabardast golabari shuru kar di
 Despite being badly injured, he killed another terrorist
 jab major mukunda ko baahar nikaala gaya tab tak wo gambhir rup se ghayal hone kii vajah se shahid ho gaye
 Major Mukund's wife Indu says that looks good, but also sad
 unke rahete hue ye miltaa to zyada acha lagata
 The four-year-old daughter realizes that the father has gone to God
 badi hone par wo agar fouj main yaa or jahaan kahin bhi chaahegi to vahiin bhejuungi
 Major Mukund Apani sacrificed his life while fighting for the country at the age of 31
 aaj indu kahati hai ki main to deshavaasiyon se bas itnaa ummid karti hum ki wo mukunda kii shahadat ko yaad rakhen
 They should not be forgotten
 koshish ye bhi ho kam se kam log shahid hon
 She also says that there is still patriotism left in the country
 akhbaar se lekar televijan tak main in shaheedon par ek choti si khabar chal / chap jaaegi par jitani charchaa parade kii duusare khabaron ko mil rahi he, uski tulana main to ye khabar kisi kone main dab jaaegi
 By the way, neither Major Mukund nor Naik Neeraj's wife will complain to the country that why this country does not remember the sacrifices of the sons as much as it should be kept
 par kya hamaara koi ferj nahin banataa
 Let their kubarnis go like this

 ek taraf surakshabalon ke jawan apni jaan par khelkar is shahadat kaa badla lene ke liye pulavama main aatankiyon ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaa rahe hai
 At the same time, in the media discussion, leaders of political parties are not refraining from doing politics

 Amit Malviya, the head of the bjp's IT cell, said that in the last 5 years, the army's dominance in the valley has been increased, but the political leaders, separatists and some political parties there have pushed the stone-pelters forward
 amit malviya ne endie or upie sarkaar ke dauraan javaanon kii shahadat or nagarikon kii maut kaa aankada pesh karte hue kaha ki upie ke 10 saal ke kaarykaal main 1228 surakshabalon ke jawan maare gaye jabaki endie main 'sirf' 405 javaanon kii maut hui, jo ki pichhali sarkaar kii tulana main 33 fisadi kam he
 Malaviya said that 211 local civilians died in Kashmir during the NDA government, while 1830 civilians died during the tenure of the UPA
 unhone kaha ki hamen maananaa hoga ki yah yuddh jaisi paristhiti he
 But some political parties did not desist from doing politics on Pulwama

 But when BJP started politics, the Congress party would like to remind them that when the security forces were fighting the terrorists during the 2008 Mumbai attacks, then the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi held a conference at the Gateway of India
 bijepi kii taraf se rakt ranjit ishtihaar prakashit kar sarkaar ko kamjor dikhaane kii koshish kii gai

 Not a single incident happened that Kashmiri children were oppressed

 Some politicians go to any lengths to prove their political dominance in elections

 Apparently such works are done in a stealthy manner, so such illegal works are less visible
 avaidh hathiyaaron kaa khulaasa tab hua jab buudhvaar ko punjab ke batala main avaidh hathiyaaron kii ek factory ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Many illegal weapons are being manufactured in this factory
 batala kii is factory main na keval hathiyaar banaae ja rahe the balki hathiyaaron kii testing kaa kaam bhi kiya ja rahaa tha
 In Punjab, arms licenses are still being given despite the code of conduct being implemented
 pichley hafte rupnagar jile main kii gai ek food and drug administration(epad) mahila adhikari kii hatya main istemaal kiya gaya 32 bor kaa revolver 8 march ko hi kharida gaya tha
 His license was issued the next day after the code of conduct came into force
 chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki na to revolver kharidne vaale aaropee balvinder ne or na hi gan dealer ne hathiyaar kii kharid-farokht kii soochna prashasan ko di
 Although the state government has issued instructions to the lawmakers to deposit their weapons, there is a huge stock of illegal weapons in its state

 Even today the people of Bihar's acid attack are not forgotten
 isi sansanikhej cond ke baad surkhiyon main aayaa tha bihar ke bahubali mafia or netaa shahabuddin kaa naam
 This is the case due to which Shahabuddin had to go to jail
 or isi maamle main koi gavaah na milane kii vajah seshahabuddinko adaalat ne jamaanat par reeha kiya gaya tha lekin supreme court ne unki jamaanat radd kar di
 With Shahabuddin coming into the discussion, this matter is once again reminding people of the dreadful incident, which is known as acid attack
 aisa tutaa tha ek parivaar par kaharbaat varsh 2004 kii he
 Chandreshwar Prasad alias Chanda Babu lived with his wife, daughter and four sons in Siwan district of Bihar
 unki mukhya bazaar main do dukaane thim
 One grocery and the other groceries
 ek dukaan par unka betaa satish baithta tha, duusare par girish
 The day of August 16, 2004 came as a doom for the family
 kuch log chanda babu se rangadari maang rahe the
 But he refused to give
 vahi log us din unki kiraane kii dukaan par ja pahunche
 His son Satish sat at the shop
 un logon ne satish se rangadari ke do lakh rupee maange
 Satish said to give 30-40 thousand rupees
 rangadari vasuulne aae log zyada the
 They had weapons in their hands
 un logon ne satish ke saath marpet shuru kar di
 Also took out more than two lakhs kept in the flock
 satish kaa bada bhai bhi vahaan aa gaya
 He too was watching everything
 pitane ke baad satish ghar main gaya
 And brought the acid cleaning the bathroom into a mug
 sara tejaab usne rangadari vasuulne aae badmaashon par phenk diya
 The acid splashed on his brother Rajiv
 iske baad vahaan bhagdad much gai
 Two brothers were bathed in acid on the shop, the miscreants caught Satish
 uskaa bhai rajeev bhagkar kahin chhip gaya
 Then his shop was robbed
 uske baad dukaan main aag laga di gai
 The crooks put Satish in a car and took him along
 duusari dukaan par baithe girish ko is bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 After a while the armed crooks came to him and he was also abducted from there
 iske baad satish or girish kaa bada bhai rajeev bhi un badmaashon ke hathe chadh chukaa tha
 Both their shops were looted for not paying extortion money
 phir teenon bhaiyon ko ek jagah le jaaya gaya
 Where Rajiv was tied with a rope
 uske baad saream satish or girish ke upar tejaab se bhari baaltee udel di gai
 Satish and Girish were burned to death in front of the elder brother's eyes
 iske baad un donon kii laash ke tukade tukade karke bore main bharkar phenk die gaye
 Chanda Babujis was in Patna on the day of the incident, this sensational incident was carried out on that day, Satish and Girish's father Chanda Babu went to his brother Patna
 vaardaat kii khabar puure sivaan main aag kii tarah fail gai
 Someone called Chanda Babu in Patna and asked him not to come to Siwan
 agar aae to maar die jaaengen
 He was told that two of his sons had been killed, while one son was in captivity
 rajeev vahiin badmaashon kii kaid tha
 But two days later he managed to escape
 vah kisi tarah se ganne se laden ek tractor main chhipakar channpur ja pahunchaa
 From there he reached Padauna in Uttar Pradesh
 vahaan usne sthaneey saansad ke ghar sharan lee
 During this time, Chanda Babu's wife, both daughters and a disabled son had also left home
 sara parivaar bikhar chukaa tha
 During this time, Chanda Babu got the news that her third son had also been killed
 chanda babu ko maarane kii thi sajeeshais puure ghatnakram ke dauraan ek din kisi ne chanda babu ko phone karke soochna di ki aapkaa betaa chat se gir gaya he
 But the real motive behind this information was to finish calling them
 iske liye badmaashon ne yah ek sajeesh rachi thi
 Despite this Chanda Babu mustered courage and reached Siwan
 unhone vahaan police adheekshak se milane kii koshish kii lekin unhen espi se milane nahin diya gaya
 When he reached the police station, the inspector said that you should leave Siwan immediately
 uske baad chanda babu chhapra ke saansad ko lekar patna main ek bade netaa ke paas gaye
 But the leader brushed aside saying that if the matter is of Siwan, he cannot do anything
 is dauraan badmaashon ko chanda babu ke netaa se milane kii khabar lag gai
 He called Chanda Babu's Patna brother and threatened him
 wo dhamkee se itnaa ghabara gaye ki unhone fouran chanda babu kaa saath chhod diya or fouran apana tabadalaa patna se mumbai kara liya
 Even after going there, he received threatening calls, due to which he suffered a heart attack and died
 jila police ne nahin kii thi madadiske baad chanda babu patna main hi rahane lage
 He was completely unconscious
 unki haalat kisi sadhu kii tarah ho gai thi
 He wandered from here to there for several days
 baad main ek vidhayak ne unhen sharan di
 Meanwhile, Chanda Babu came to know that his son Rajiv is still alive
 is khabar ne unamem ek nai urja bhar di
 After this, in Patna, Chanda Babu somehow met a prominent leader of Sonpur once again
 or unase suraksha dilaane kii guhaar lagaai
 The leader assured help and directed Bihar DGP Narayan Mishra
 dijipi ne aiji ko patr likhaa
 IG wrote to DIG and then DIG wrote to SP
 magar hua kuch nahin
 Disappointed Chanda Babu went to Delhi
 vahaan unki mulaakaat rahul gandhi se hui
 But only got assurance
 himmat karke chanda babu phir sivaan aae
 Made up my mind to go to SP
 magar unka koi rishtedaar yaa dost unke saath jane ko taiyaar nahin hua
 When nothing happened, Chanda Babu went to his house alone to meet the SP one morning
 espi milakar suraksha kii guhaar lagaai
 The letter of DIG was also given to the SP
 magar espi ne bhi chanda babu ko sivaan chhod dene kii baat kahi
 Chanda Babu was again DIG a after Rajiv's public assassination
 ke
 Arrived to meet Beg
 diaiji ne unki baat sunakar espi ko fatkaar lagaai or fouran suraksha dene ke liye kaha
 After that Chanda Babu got protection
 tab vah sivaan main hi rahane lage
 Meanwhile, one day his son Rajiv returned
 uske saath chanda babu kii patni, betiyaan or viklang bhai bhi waapas aa gaye
 a few days later, Rajiv got married
 magar mushkilen abhi khatm nahin huin thim
 Rajiv was shot dead in public on 16 June 2014, on the 18th day of marriage
 rajeev apane bhaiyon kii hatya kaa akelaa chashmadid gavaah tha
 Rajiv had already made a statement in the court in this regard
 tab bhi use jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di gai thi
 Shahabuddin's arrest In 2004, a case under Section 302 of the IPC was registered against Shahabuddin in the sensational murder case known as Tezaab
 lekin giraftaar nahin hui thi
 But in the year 2005, the Nizam of Bihar changed
 nitish kumaar kii sarkaar aa gai
 And the screws on Shahabuddin were tightened
 usee saal shahabuddin ko dilli se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Since then, Shahabuddin was kept in jail under strict surveillance
 videon coffrencing ke jariye hi adaalat main unki sunavai hoti thi
 Shahabuddin was sentenced by the trial court in several cases in the meantime
 unke khilaaf 39 hatya or apharan ke maamle the
 At 38, he was granted bail
 39waan cese rajeev kaa tha
 Who was an eyewitness to the murder of his two brothers
 magar 2014 main uski hatya ke saath hi shahabuddin kii jamaanat kaa rasta saaf ho gaya tha
 And finally 11 years later Shahabuddin came out on bail
 lekin unke baahar aane se soobe kii siyasat main halchal much gai
 Now once again, all eyes are on Nitish Kumar in this matter

 These days, there is confusion regarding the retention age of doctors of Delhi Government
 centre sarkaar ne doctoron kii ritairement umr 60 saal se badhaakar 65 saal to kar di, lekin dilli sarkaar abhi tak is par koi bhi faisla nahin le paa rahi he
 Meanwhile, some doctors have also approached the court regarding the confusion of retirement age
 ritairement kii umraper pahunche doctoron ko is baat kaa intjaar he ki dilli sarkaar kab doctoron kii ritairement age ko badhaane kaa notification jari karti he
 Despite almost 2 months passed, the Delhi Government has not yet implemented the Central Government's decision to make the retirement age of doctors 65 years in Delhi
 rohinee kebaba sahab ambedkar aspataalmen darmotoliji vibhaag ke doctor es bi shrivastav bhi aise hi doctoron main se ek hai
 On 30 June, Dr
 Srivastava was retiring but due to not implementing the Central Government notification on the retirement age of doctors of Delhi Government, Dr
 Srivastava had to approach the court
 dilli main automatic lagu hota he centre kaa adeshdoctor shrivastav ke edwocket ajesh luthra ke mutabik dilli health sarvice allopathy ke niyamon ke mutabik kendra sarkaar kaa aadesh dilli main automatic lagu ho jaataa he, lekin dow esabi shrivastav ko isliye court janaa padaa kyonkidilli sarkarritairement age ke nae aadesh ko notiphoi nahin kar rahi he
 At the moment Dr
 Srivastava has got a stay
 lekin ye fori raahat he
 Like Dr
 Srivastava, doctors who are approaching the retirement age, their concern is increasing
 dilli main 62 hi he doctoron kii ritairement agedrasal dilli main doctoron kii ritairement age abhi tak 62 hi bani hui he jabaki dilli health sarvice allopathy ke niyamon ke mutabik kendra sarkaar ke niyam dilli main yathaavat lagu hota he
 That is, the rule has come into force but till Delhi government notifies it, there will be a phase of confusion regarding paperwork and pay scale
 aspataalon ko ab tak dilli sarkaar kaa age badhaane kaa aadesh nahin mila, lihaaja ab jo doctor ritairement age par he unhen kiske niyam maanane honge, ye sawaal doctoron ko din-raat pareshaan kar rahaa he
 There is also the HR of hospitals
 The HR department of Confuse hospitals is also unable to decide whether the salaries will be made next to the doctors

 The Health Minister's response is pointing to the wavering attitude of the government
 baharhaal, notification jari nahin karne ke peeche manshaa raajnneetik he yaa kuch or ye to mantri sahab hi jane, lekin sarkaar ke notification nahin jari karne se dilli sarkaar ke aise doctor zarur pareshaan he jo is maheene ritair ho rahe hai

 In such a situation, Shivanand Tiwari, who is considered to be Lalu's special, has also opted out of the post of National Vice President of the party

 He has written in his statement that i am feeling tired

 Tiwari did not stop here
 unhone aage likhaa ki sansmaran likhnaa chahta tha
 i am not able to do that either
 isliye jo kar rahaa hum, usase chuttee paanaa chahta hum
 Shivanand Tiwari told the reason for leaving the post, Shivanand Tiwari has written that i will try to write a memoir
 likh hi duungaa aisa bharosa bhi nahin he, lekin prayaas karuunga
 So i am taking a leave from the role i was performing till now on behalf of RJD
 haalanki, is bayaan se yah saaf he ki unhoneargedise naata nahin todaa he, balki keval party main apni jimmedaari se chuttee lee he
 But it is believed that Shivanand Tiwari is very sad due to his neglect in RJD and in a way he has given a message to the party that if his neglect continues, he can also leave the party
 netaa badale, badali party lekin nahin badali nishthaghor samaajawaadee prishthbhumi ke netashivanand tiwarijis party main rahe, jiske saath rahe, uske saath puri nishtha ke saath rahe
 Whether it is Lalu Prasad Yadav or Nitish Kumar, his arguments along with the party keep changing, but no loyalty
 tiwari kii ginati aise netaaon main hoti he, jo apni apni upeksha bardaasht nahin kar sakate
 While being a Rajya Sabha MP from JDU, Shivanand Tiwari's words did not go down when the party's national executive meeting in Rajgir made Narendra Modi the Prime Ministerial candidate from the alliance partner Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 nateeja yah hua ki rajyasabha kaa tikat cat gaya or party ne baxur se 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ladane kaa farmaan jari kar diya
 Shivanand Tiwari told politics to retire, but RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav not only invited him to his party, but also made him the national vice-president
 majbootee se rakhte hai apni batjab tak shivanand tiwari jediu main the, tab tak unke nishane par argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav rahe
 As soon as he returned to the RJD again, his target went to Parnitesh Kumarua
 chaara ghotaalaa maamle main yachikakarta rahane ke baavjood jab argedy adhyaksh ko isi maamle main sajaa hui, tiwari ne uskaa khulkar virodh kiya
 Even if he has to go for this backward-backward politics, this is also his specialty
 vah apni baat ko puri majbootee se rakhte hai
 There was a lot of questioning in the Lalu period, till Lalu Prasad Yadav, the head of RJD, did not go to jail, there was a tremendous ask in Shivanand Tiwari's party
 padhane-likhane vaale netaa hai, isliye argedy ke liye or mahatvapurn the
 However, like other senior leaders, when Lalu went to jail, his younger son Tejashwi Yadav, who took command of the party, fell victim to neglect
 party kii nitiyon kaa nirdhaaran ho, kisi vishay par koi stand lene kii baat, tejasvi ne anbhavi netaaon kii raay lene ke bajaay party chalaane main nae logon kii raay ko tarjeeh di or yah shivanand tiwari ko raas nahin aata tha
 Tiwari continued to defend the RJD despite the neglect of the senior leaders, but the future of the party continued to frighten him
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi ki unhone kai baar nitish kumaar ko phir se maha gathbandhan kaa netaa banane kaa nyauta diya or jamkar tarif bhi kii
 After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, when Tejashwi Yadav was away from the party's meetings, the party's programs and no one was aware of where he is, Tiwari also advised him
 aise samay main jab party kaa mukhiya jail main he, lalu parivaar main bhi sabakuch thik nahin chal rahaa, tiwari jaise anbhavi netaa kaa party kii santhnik jimmedaariyon se kinaaraa karnaa bada jhatka he

 Let us know about some measures which are also easy to do and by adopting this you can avoid heat stroke to a great extent
 jab bhi ghar se baahar nikalen, ek-do gilaas thanda pani pikar hi nikalen taaki is mausam kii tej lapat or jhulasa dene vaali garm hawa ke kaaran hone vaala dihydration aap paraturant haaavee na ho
 Increase the intake of water, drink at least 10 to 15 glasses of water throughout the day
 isamen koi kotahi na karen
 You may forget to eat, but do not forget to drink water, because due to heat, most of our body's water gets washed away through sweat

 So avoid spicy and fried foods a little

 Whenever you go out of the house, take steps to protect the head and skin from strong sunlight
 iske liye chaataa, topi, scorf, tauliya or gloves kaa istemaal karen
 Dark sunglasses and goggles prove to be very helpful in protecting the eyes from the sun's strong rays, as well as you will look fashionable
 so inkaa yathochit prayog karen
 To protect your skin from hitstroke, use good quality sunscreen lotion
 sharir kaa immune system majboot ho iske liye subah uthakar taaji hawa kaa seven karen
 Take bath with cold water as far as possible
 sooti vastra ko garmi ke mausam ke liye sabase badhiya mana gaya he, isliye isse bane vastra adhik se adhik pahanen
 Another advantage of this is that cotton clothes are better at absorbing sweat
 aap agar thakaan adhik mahasoos karte ho to chehre par taaje pani ke chhinten maaren
 This will make you feel fresh
 sada pani hamaari twachaa ko narm or tarotaaja rakhata he, saath hi prakritik moischariser kii tarah kaam karata he
 At night or when you are free, apply cucumber juice (juice) on the face
