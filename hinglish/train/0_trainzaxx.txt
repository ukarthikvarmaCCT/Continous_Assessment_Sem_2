 har chunaav main tisare morche kii sarkaar kii baat karne vaale or uski dhuree banane vaale left front kii apni haalat patali he
 In such a situation, the question is, how will this front reach the majority figures even with the UPA? jis sipiem ne bharat-america parmaanu samjhaute ko lekar upie ek sarkaar se samarthan waapas liya tha, vah na sirf congress ke saath sarkaar banane ke liye icchhuk dikh rahi he, balki sarkaar main shaamil hone kaa sanket bhi de rahi he

 The woman's parents alleged in the complaint lodged against Rajbir, a resident of Delhi, that her daughter was tortured and treated her mercilessly for dowry
 adaalat ne rajbir ko andeh kaa laabh diya or use ipisi kii dhara 498e (pati yaa pati ke rishtedaaron dwaara mahila se nirmamata baratna) se bari kar diya
 The court said that it is necessary to impose this provision that the husband or his relatives act ruthlessly
 metropolitan magistrate ne kaha ki is maamle main peedita or aaropee ke bich shaadi khud hi sandehaaspad he, isliye aaropee ko peedita kaa pati nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The court said that the separated couple does not have the right to remarry as the first marriage is not over
 gauratlab he ki peedita ke pita ne rajbir ke khilaaf shrinivasapuri police thana main ek shikaayat darj karai thi

 farhaan akhtar ab film 'rais' main abhinay nahin karenge
 Farhan was to play an important character in this film alongside Shahrukh Khan, but Farhan left the role as he had to choose between rockone and Raees and Farhan chose rockone
 darasal, film rais ko jo company produs kar rahi he uske ek hissedaar farhaan bhi hai, yani farhaan khud film rais ke nirmaataa bhi hue
 He could have acted comfortably in Raees if he wanted, but Farhan chose rockon-2, as shooting time for Rais and rockon-2 was colliding
 tippaniyan Farhan told that 'I have given up the rich
 ab main rais main abhinay nahin kar rahaa hum, kyonki rockon-2 kii shooting or rais kii shooting ek hi samay par ho rahi he
 My look is different in rockon-2 and different look in Raees
 aise main ham donon filmon kii shooting ek samay par nahin kar sakate the, isliye hamane rockon-2 karne kaa faisla kiya, kyonki rockon mere liye bahut khaas film he
 There is a film very close to my heart, so i could not leave it
 ' Well, Farhan is also right, because Rockon is the film through which Farhan came to the world as an actor and singer
 lihaaja, iske sikval ko chunanaa farhaan ke liye mahatvapurn faisla he
 Actually, the company producing the film Raees is also a part of Farhan, that is, Farhan himself was also the producer of the film Raees
 agar wo chaahate to rais main bade aaraam se abhinay kar sakate the, magar farhaan ne rockon-2 ko chunaa, kyonki rais or rockon-2 kii shooting kaa samay takaraa rahaa tha
 The comments farhaan ne bataaya ki 'maine rais chhod di he
 i am no longer acting in Raees, as rockon-2 is shooting and Raees is shooting at the same time
 rockon-2 main meraa luk alag he or rais main alag luk
 In such a situation, we could not shoot both films at one time, so we decided to do rockon-2, because rockone is a very special film for me
 mere dil ke bahut kareeb film he, isliye main ise nahin chhod saktaa tha
 ' vaise farhaan kii baat bhi sahi he, kyonki rockon hi wo film he, jiske jariye farhaan bataur abhinayta or gayak duniya ke saamne aae
 So, choosing its sequel is an important decision for Farhan

 All the people who were present in the defense colony house of Rohit Shekhar Tiwari were on the radar of the police
 police kaa kahana he ki kisi ko bhi abhi tak clin chit nahin di gai he
 In fact, after the testimony of police, electronic surveillance, CCTV cameras, forensic experts and eyewitnesses, it is reassuring that no one came from outside the house or went out of the house on the night of 15 and 16 April
 yani jo bhi sajeesh or saboot he wo ghar ke andar hi he
 On April 15, Monday, the first phase of voting was held on April 12 in Defense Colony, Delhi, Uttarakhand
 rohit shekhar kaa vot uttarakhand main tha
 So he went there with his mother
 15 april kii raat rohit uttarakhand se dilli lautataa he or sidhe apane ghar aata he
 That night, Rohit's defense colony was in the house, Rohit's wife Apoorva, elder brother Siddharth Sharma, maid Martha, servant Golu, driver Akhilesh were present
 dinar ke baad chali gayi marohit kii maa kaa ek sarkari ghar tilak len main bhi he
 She lives there too
 15 april kii raat rohit kii maa ujjwala sharma bhi rohit ke dephence colony vaale is ghar main ai thim
 But after dinner, she went to Tilak Lane house
 ujjwala ke mutabik us raat rohit ko jab unhone dekha to wo thik-thaak tha
 Just seemed a little drunk
 15 april, somvaar, raat 10 bajeus raat rohit kii maa ujjwala dinar karne ke liye rohit ke ghar ai thim
 According to Rohit's mother, then Rohit was not in the living room
 jab unhone rohit kii patni apurva se poocha to usne bataaya ki rohit thak gaye hai or apane kamare main so rahe hai
 However, shortly after, Rohit came downstairs and after dinner got his mother in his car and went to sleep again
 16 april, mangalvaar, shaam 4 bajerohit kii maa ke mutabik wo agle din 16 april ko dopaher kareeb 2 baje wo waapas ain to apurva ne bataaya ki rohit abhi so kar nahin uthaa he
 Ujjwala then asked Rajiv Kumar, nephew and former OSD of ND Tiwari, to take a doctor's appointment at Max Hospital for treatment of his thumb
 unhen 4
 Got time at 45
 ujjwala driver akhilesh or rajeev ke saath maiks aspataal chali gayi
 But just about 4 had reached the gate of the hospital
 30 baje ujjwala ke purv karmchaaree ramesh kaa kol aayaa or usne bataaya ki rohit kii tabiyat bighad gai he
 When Ujjwala herself reached home with an ambulance, Apoorva was lying in her car
 magar phir usee ambulance main rohit ko aspataal le jaaya jaataa he
 Where doctors declared him dead
 postmortem report ne badali kahanerohit kii achaanak maut se ghar vaale hairaan to the, par sabko yahi laga ki maut natural he
 But three days later, when the post mortem report came, the whole story was overturned
 19 april ko ai postmortem report main kaha gaya ki rohit kii maut dam ghutane se hui he
 There are also marks on the throat
 shaq he ki takie se rohit kaa munh dabaaya gaya hoga
 While in the report, the time of death has been told between one and half hour
 or bhi ho sakate hai kaatil ke madadgamb agar rohit kii maut galaa dabaane se hi hui he to sawaal ye he ki tandoorust or thik-thaak rohit ko koi akele gola ghont kar kaise maar saktaa he? to ek shaq ye bhi he ki us raat rohit ne kaaphi sharaab pi thi or zyada nashe main tha
 So he could not defend himself perhaps due to intoxication
 yaa ye bhi bahut mumkin he ki kaatil ek se zyada hon
 That is, someone has helped the murderer in the murder

 meerut kii ek raily main bijepi vidhayak sangeet som ne kaha ki upi kaa aglaa chunaav hindustan or pakistan ke bich jang kii tarah he
 In this, defeating BJP is equivalent to making Pakistan here
 gaiyr-bhaajapai dalon main is bayaan kii tikhi pratikriya hui or bhaajapa kaa kahana he ki vah is bayaan kii samiksha kar rahi he
 Perhaps Sangeet Som thinks that if BJP wins in UP assembly elections, Hindustan will win
 lekin agar gaiyr bijepi party jiti to yah jeet pakistan kii hogi
 Sangeet Som said that the fight here is between India and Pakistan, keep in mind
 ek taraf pakistan he, ek taraf hindustan he
 Think about what you have to do
 kya karnaa he? ekatarfa kar lo maamla
 Sangeet Som is an MLA from Sardhana seat of Meerut
 mujffarnagar dangon main bhi unka naam aayaa he
 He believes that even if he loses and Imran Yakub of BSP wins, Pakistan will become here
 sangeet som ne kaha ki bhaajapa ekatarfa he, agar koi thodaa bahut chunaav main rahegaa to basapa vaala rahegaa, ye sachai he yaa nahin? sapa vaale kah rahe hai ki ham to haar hi gaye, hamen to ye vidhayak haraana he
 Tell me what to make Pakistan after defeating the MLA
 sangeet som ke is bayaan ko lekar gaiyr bhaajapai dalon ne tikhi pratikriya di he
 The comments upi sarkaar main rajyamantri naved siddhiki ne kaha ki jis tarah kii vah baat kar rahe hai mulk ko baantne kii baat kar rahe hai
 He is bringing this issue (of Hindustan Pakistan) from somewhere
 pakistan kisko kah rahe hai is desh ke andar
 He is saying Pakistan to a community
 upi bijepi ke adhyaksh keshav prasad maury ne kaha ki ye bhaajapa nahin kah rahi he or na ham is baat kaa samarthan karte hai, lekin ham is bayaan kii samiksha karenge
 Will take a decision only after that
 shaayad sangeet som ko yah lagata he ki upi vidhansabha chunaavon main agar bijepi jiti to hindustan jitegaa
 But if non-bjp party wins, it will be Pakistan's win
 sangeet som ne kaha ki yahaan ladaai hindustan or pakistan kii he, ye dhyaan rakhie
 On one side is Pakistan, on the one side is India
 tumhen kya karnaa he ye soch lo
 What is the plan? One sided case
 sangeet som meerut kii sardhana seat se emele hai
 His name has also figured in Muzaffarnagar riots
 vah maanate hai ki agar vah haar gaye or unki jagah bispi ke imran yakub jeet gaye to bhi yahaan pakistan ban jayega
 Sangeet Som said that the BJP is one sided, if someone stays in the election a little, the BSP will remain, is this true or not? The SP people are saying that we have lost, we have to defeat this MLA
 vidhayak ko haraa ke kya pakistan bananaa he, mujhe bataa do
 non-bjp parties have reacted sharply to this statement of Sangeet Som
 tippaniyan Minister of State in UP Government Naved Siddiqui said that the way he is talking, he is talking about dividing the country
 vah kahin na kahin se yah mudda (hindustan pakistan kaa) lekar aa rahe hai
 Whom Pakistan is telling inside this country
 vah pakistan ek kaum ko kah rahe hai
 UP BJP President Keshav Prasad Maurya said that this BJP is not saying nor do we support this, but we will review this statement
 uske baad hi koi nirnay lenge
 Sangeet Som said that the fight here is between India and Pakistan, keep in mind
 ek taraf pakistan he, ek taraf hindustan he

 maury ne kaha ki sattarudh dal kii shah par kanoon ko apane haathon main lekar pathar laane vaale log desi antkavaadi hai
 These people have no meaning with the law
 ye log keval saamaajik sauhaard bigaadane ke liye aisi harakatein kar rahe hai
 On the target of the SP too, he called a press conference on Tuesday and said that during the Lok Sabha elections, the ruling SP and BJP had burnt the entire state in the fire of riots
 ye phir se waisi hi harakatein karne ke prayaas hai
 Maurya said, 'the hindu-muslim unity of the state is getting disintegrated in the Nurakushti of SP-BJP
 ram janmabhumi kaa puraa maamla sarvocch nyaayalay main vichaaradhin he, phir bijepi ke logon ko kanoon haath main lene kii jarurat kyon padi?' sapa main panchayat chunaav ko lekar mache ghamaasan ko lekar swami prasad maury ne kaha ki pradesh ko pehle se chaar mukhyamantri chalaa rahe hai to antardvad to hona hi he
 The controversy within the party is now coming out freely, which will be very harmful for the SP in the 2017 assembly elections
 sarkaar par lagaae jaateey bhedbhaav ke aaropawah pradesh main chal rahe adhikariyon ke padaavnat ko lekar bhi pradesh sarkaar par jamkar barase
 He said that the government is deliberately harassing the SC and ST officials
 isamen sarkaar kii kuntha or saamanti soch dikhti he
 Maurya said that due to this discriminatory attitude of the government, so far 15,226 employees and officers have been demoted from their posts
 iske alaava sarkaar 50,000 shikshakon ko bhi padaavnat karne kii yojana bana chuki he
 He said that the police department is also not untouched by racial oppression
 padonnati praapt 212 sab inspectoron ko padaavnat kar head consteble bana diya gaya he
 58 sub-officers have also been sent to lower posts against the law
 unhone kaha ki is maamle main mukhyamantri va mukhyaschiv se vaarta ho chuki he, lekin kuch bhi hal nahin niklaa
 The number of employees and officers who have been demoted has reached three lakhs
 maury ne chetavanee di ki sarkaar is maamle main sajag hokar bhedbhaav band kare, anyathaa aath lakh padaadhikari andolan ke liye sadakon par utar sakate hai
 An interesting case has come to light in the Bombay High Court
 78 saal kii ek mahila par aarope he ki usne 55 saal kii duusari mahila ke saath chhedchhad kii he
 The court on Monday asked the prosecution and the petitioner (who may also be the culprits in the case) to find out if a woman can be arrested in such a case
 court ne yah bhi nirdesh diya he ki duusare deshon ke kanoonee pahaluon kaa adhyayan kar pataa lagaaein ki is tarah ke maamle main kisi mahila ko sajaa dene kaa praavdhaan he
 In his petition, 78-year-old Vimalabai Shah, who lives in Borivali (west), said that on 27 February 2010, on the complaint of 55-year-old Prabha Jain, the police arrested her and her family members under Section 354 of the IPC
 vimalbai kaa aarope he ki borivali police stesan ke inspector enem more vishesh rup se unke peeche pade hue hai jo unke parivaar se badla lenaa chaahate hai
 According to Shah, his son-in-law Kirti Padesia sent a notice to Suryakant Sharma for illegal flat transfers when he was the secretary of Shashi Tara Apartments
 yachikakarta kaa aarope he ki sharma ne shah parivaar se badla lene ke liye more ke saath milakar chhedchhad kaa cese banwaaya
 While Jain, along with the police, filed a case to pressure the Shah family
 taaki shah family uske khilaaf kii gai shikaayat waapas le le
 The petition said that 78-year-old Shah lay in bed
 aise main senior citigen chhedchhad kii aaropee kaise ho sakati he
 The next hearing of the case will be held in June

 His favorite songs by BJP President Nitin Gadkari
 jindagi kisi he paheli ko lekar lagaav ne, lagata he, unhen ek acha paheli boojhne vaala bana diya he
 It is a matter of fact that in this sequence they create a new puzzle
 vastav main gadakari ne gaiyr-bharosemand jharkhand mukti morcha (jhamumo) or utane hi apratyaashit shibu sorain ko us formule par raji kara liya jise teen maah pehle unhone hi khaarij kar diya tha
 By doing this, he has worked like a magician to get the rabbit out of the Jharkhanduma cap
 bhaajapa ke arjuna munda ke netritv main rajya main sarkaar kaa gathan ho jane ke saath hi jharkhand main pichley 10 saal ke itihaas main aathvin sarkaar satta main aa gai he
 This is the second government formed during the tenure of the current Vidhan Sabha, formed in December 2009
 jhamumo ke alaava, munda sarkaar ko ol jharkhand students union (5 vidhayak), janata dal-united (jad-you)(2 vidhayak) or do nirdaleey vidhayakon kaa samarthan praapt he
 The deadlock between the JMM and the BJP was created in May when Shibu Soren and his son Hemant said that they would support only if the post of the Chief Minister of the state was given to someone else instead of Munda
 chunki donon partiyaan is gatirodh ko todane main kaamyaab nahin ho sakin, isliye 1 june, 2010 ko rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagu kar diya gaya
 It seems that it was the fear of dissolution of the assembly that brought the two parties closer and the JMM quietly agreed to join the Munda-led government
 badi baat to yah he ki gathbandhan sambandhi yah bandobast do partiyon main saliyat ke saude ke alaava kuch or nahin he, jo sirf apane raajnneetik khel ko or parishkrut karne ke liye sahamat hui hai
 During the three months of President's rule, Soren and Hemant realized that the continuing discontent in their party, with a section of legislators openly challenging their supremacy, could be uncontrollable
 unke vafaadaar vidhayak bhi utsuk the ki jhamumo pramukh apane paale ko ekajute rakhane ke liye jitani jaldi ho sake, kisi ke bhi saath milakar sarkaar kaa gathan kar len
 According to sources, this feeling prompted Hemant to start talks with Ghadkari afresh
 gadakari ne sthiti kaa jayja lene ke liye munda ko tainaat kar diya
 The JMM was ready to take second place, ie Hemant, who became a first-time MLA, as Deputy Chief Minister
 natijatan, chaalaak munda ne vidhayakon kii laalasaa or hataasha ko apane hit main bhunaaya or sarkaar kaa gathan kar liya
 The question arises here, how long will this settlement last? The Soren father-son duo is notorious for their ambitions and gains
 koi tajjub nahin ki donon partiyon ko iske chalane kii kam hi ummid he
 But both were desperate to form the government as they wanted that their government would enable the legislators to carry out some development work in their assembly constituencies, so that if the mid-term elections are held then they can be shown in it
 darasal, jhamumo ne pehle congress ke dwaar par dastak di thi
 But after his cold reaction it became easy to bargain with the BJP
 vaise, sarkaar gathan kii is prakriya ne bhaajapa main kai tarah ke matbhedon ko paidaa kar diya he
 It is said that the veteran party leader LK Advani and some other senior leaders were reportedly expressing dissatisfaction with Gadkari's stand alone efforts in the Jharkhand case
 iske alaava, bhaajapa netritv kaa ek dhada is saude ke khilaaf tha kyonki is saal may main jhamumo ke saath party ke 'aruchikar' anubhav rahe the
 Shibu Soren then voted against the bjp-sponsored cut motion in the Lok Sabha despite a bjp-backed government in Jharkhand
 kayaas lagaae gaye ki party ise lekar banty hui he, or yah baat us samay sabit ho gai jab 11 sitambar ko ranchi main munda ke shapath grahan samaaroh main party ke kai sheersh netaa najar nahin aae
 Some highly offended leadership of the BJP seems to be at the end of Munda's list of concerns
 mukhyamantri ne jis tarah ke doston ko chunaa he, uske chalate unhen bamushkil hi dushmano kii jarurat he
 The number of ministries in the state government cannot exceed 12, so that they have to divide the departments in such a way that the JMM and JD (U) create the least conflicting conditions
 sabko santusht karnaa bhale hi munda ke bas main na ho, lekin jharkhand kii paristhitiyon ne unke kad main jabardast ijapha kiya he
 After all, the 42-year-old general secretary of the BJP is a politician who has managed to instill confidence in Gadkari and his predecessor Rajnath Singh that he was ready to push back those who oppose his name at any cost
 or phir, bhagava party main munda akele adivasee netaa hai jinako lekar sorain pita-putr chintit rahete hai
 Of course, he does not have the charisma like Babulal Marandi or the old-fashioned status of Shibu, but he is a dependable leader who believes strongly in honoring friendship
 unhone rajya ke raajnneetik paridrishy main sabhi dhurandharon ke bich apane liye ek khaas jagah kaayam kii he
 From the 2003 Chief Minister to the Chief Minister today, he is the party's first and only choice for the post
 lekin jhamumo munda par bharosa kyon nahin karata? munda ne raajnneeti main sorain ke shishy ke rup main hi jagah banaai thi or ve 1995 main vidhayak bane the lekin 1999 main unhone apane guru ko chhod diya or bhagava party main shaamil ho gaye, is kadam ne unhen khaas mukaam hasil karne main khaasi madad kii
 If Munda had stayed with Soren, he would not have got a ministerial position yet, because he is a party where the family is given the first place
 jab se donon alag hue hai unke bich sirf virodh kaa hi rishta chal rahaa he
 In the past, Soren and Munda have been instrumental in removing each other from the chief minister's post
 donon hi ne teen baar rajya ke is sheersh pad ko hasil kiya he lekin munda kii mukhyamantri pad par rahane kii avadhi sorain kii avadhi se doguni se zyada he
 After jmm's support to the BJP, many people are now saying that this love is not going to last long in both the parties
 isamen antarnihit virodhabhaason ko dekhte hue munda sarkaar bahut aaraam ke saath apana kaarykaal puraa kar sakegi, iskaa bharosa bahut kam logon ko he
 Meanwhile, Soren will head the Steering Committee to ensure that all allies of the coalition work together
 ek aisa pad jis par rahakar ve samasya kaa samaadhaan karne ke bajaay use paidaa karne kaa kaam karenge
 Soren has indicated that he will not maintain the same distance as he said earlier
 lekin jo log guruji ko jaanate hai, ve daawa karte hai ki ve is baar sambhawatah sarkaar ko chalane den kyonki unka betaa hemanth sorain sarkaar main up-mukhyamantri pad par jo asin he or isliye bhi ki shaayad kisi tarah se vyaavhaarik samaj bhi unhen aa gai ho
 The National Eligibility Test will be conducted on 28 December 2014 across the country
 ab is exam kii taiyaari ke liye kaaphi kam samay bachaa he
 So keep these points in mind while revising in the last time
 taiyaari kii samay seemaa ko badaye:net ke exam kaa silebus bada hota he, or ab bahut kam samay batch gaye hai
 In this case, you should make a schedule correctly
 zyaadaatar net pariksha main safal hue students kaa maananaa he ki last samay main shedul banaakar kii gai padhai exam paas karne main zyada madad karti he
 Pay more attention to basic things: In NET exam, many questions are related to the basic information of that subject, so increase the basic information
 Syllabus and Pattern: Before preparing for the exam, do check syllabus once, lest the last time
 i know you have some topic left
 taiyaari kii ek ranneeti banaaen:kam samay main taiyaari karne ke liye ek ranneeti kaa hona bahut jaruri he, aap kuch sawaal khud se taiyaar karen or jawaab dhudhane kii koshish karen
 If you do this daily then your preparation will continue to move in the right direction
 practice:angreji main ek kahawat practice mex main parfect, ji haa practice se aap koi bhi kaam achche tarah se kar sakate hai
 Keep a clear vision, time management and key factors with you and repeat it
 aisa karne par aap zyada sikh paaenge
 Follow Study Materials: Many times students hurry and buy those books from the market, whose study material is very poor, due to which your preparation can go in the wrong direction
 net kii taiyaari karne ke liye hameshaa soch-samajhakar or salaah lekar hi koi kitaab khariden
 Make shortnotes: When you understand how much time to spend on which topic, then after that you can make shortnotes of those topics, in which at least you can get complete information about that topic
 revijan:exam se pehle sabase zyada jaruri revijan karnaa hota he, revijan safalataa dilwati he
 a few days before the exam, decide beforehand that these days only and only revision has to be done
 kai sari aisi chijen hoti hai jise aap exam se pehle to pard lete hai, lekin baad main bhul jate hai
 To avoid this mistake, make revision

 dilli uniwarsity se 4 saal kaa grameuation course to hat gaya, lekin ab bhi kuch uniwarsities is par kaayam hai
 Controversy has arisen over the ongoing 4-year graduation course at the Indian Institute of Science (IISC) in Bangalore
 ujisi notification milane ke baavjood yah college apane FYUP program ko lekar tus se mas hone ko taiyaar nahin he
 IISC director Professor Anurag Thakur said in a conversation with a newspaper, 'it is not hidden from anyone that we have received the letter from UGC
 philhal ham ujisi ke senior adhikariyon ke sampark main hai or unase baatcheet kar rahe hai
 Our institute is successfully conducting this course with 425 students, so we are trying to convince them for FYUP
 'buudhvaar ko kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri smriti irani ne loksabhaa main is baat kii jaankaree dete hue kaha ki IISC ke alaava desh ke 2 pratishthit sansthaanon simbyosis international uniwarsity (pune) or shiv nadar uniwarsity (noida) abhi bhi FYUP program chalaa rahe hai

 aae din hamaare samaaj main mahilaon ke saath hinsa kii khabaren aati rahati hai
 The highest number of cases are domestic violence
 in maamalon main mahilaon ke prati hinsa dekhne ko milti he
 Let us know in detail what is the domestic violence law
 kya hoti he gharelu hinsakisi bhi mahila ke saath ghar kii charadivari ke andar hone vaali kisi bhi tarah kii hinsa, marpet, utpeedan aadi ke maamle isi kanoon ke tahat aate hai
 Sexual harassment cases have separate laws but can be linked to it
 mahila ko taane dena, gaali dena, uskaa apmaan karnaa, uski marji ke bina usase shaareerik sambandh banane kii koshish karnaa, jabaran shaadi ke liye baadhya karnaa aadi jaise maamle bhi gharelu hinsa ke daayre main aate hai
 Forcing the wife to leave the job, or to stop her from doing the job, for demanding dowry, etc
 can also come under this
 kya he gharelu hinsa adhiniumgharelu hinsa adhinium kaa nirmaan 2005 main kiya gaya or 26 oktober 2006 se ise desh main lagu kiya gaya
 Its purpose is to provide immediate and emergency relief to women facing violence in domestic relationships
 yah kanoon mahilaon ko gharelu hinsa se bachaata he
 In India alone, about 70 percent of women are victims of this in one form or the other
 yah bharat main pehla aisa kanoon he jo mahilaon ko apane ghar main rahane kaa adhikaar detaa he
 Under the anti-domestic Violence Act, a wife or a woman living with a man without marriage can take action in cases of assault, sexual exploitation, financial exploitation or use of abusive language
 centre or rajya sarkaar he javabdehyah kanoon gharelu hinsa ko rokane ke liye kendra va rajya sarkaar ko javabdeh or jimmedaar tehraata he
 According to this law, evidence of domestic violence against a woman does not have to be certified
 mahila ke dwaara prastut saakshyon ko hi aadhaar mana jayega kyonki adaalat kaa maananaa he ki ghar ke andar hinsa ke sakshya milanaa mushkil hota he
 Woman gets help Any woman suffering domestic violence can take a protective order before the judge for her own safety before herself or with the help of a lawyer, service provider or protection officer
 peedit mahila ke alaava koi bhi padosi, parivaar kaa sadsy, sansthaaen yaa phir khud mahila kii sahmati se apane kshetra ke nyaayik magistrate kii court main shikaayat darj karakar bachaavkaari aadesh hasil kar sakati hai
 In case of violation of this law, jail can be subject to fine as well

 The man of the tournament at World Cup 2011, Yuvraj could have given the team success with his bowling

 He also brought Kedar Jadhav, who changed the direction of the match against Bangladesh, after a long time

 mumbai hamalon ke sargana jacki ur rahamaan lakhvi ko mili jamaanat ko pakistan sarkaar shaayad dobaaraa chunauti nahin degi
 a senior official said this while referring to the government's 'own weaknesses' in the cancellation of bail, while the deadline for completion of the 26 / 11 case has expired by more than a month
 islamabad ucch nyaayalay ne lakhvi kii jamaanat ko radd karne ke liye daayar sarkaar kii yachika kaa nipataara karne ke dauraan mumbai hamalaa maamle ko sampann karne ke liye april main do maheene kii samay seemaa tay kii thi
 The High Court had also announced that if the lower court fails to conclude the case in two months and by mid-june, it will cancel Lakhvi's bail
 haalanki, ucch nyaayalay dwaara tay samay seemaa ko khatm hue dedh maheenaa guzar gaya he lekin lakhvi kii jamaanat ko dobaaraa chunauti dene ke bare main sarkaar ne aadhikarik taur par kuch nahin kaha he
 a senior government official said the government is unlikely to challenge Lakhvi's bail again
 mul rup se ucch nyaayalay ne sarkaar kii yachika kaa nipataara karne ke dauraan yah bhi kaha ki yadi bachaav paksh (lakhvi) ke vakil maamle main der ke liye jimmedaar paae jate hai to adaalat uski jamaanat radd kar sakati he lekin jamini sthiti bilkul alag he
 The comments unhone kaha ki maamle main der abhiyojan paksh ke kuch sadasyon kii ore se kii gai jinhen sarkaar har sunwaayee main pesh hone ke liye acchhee khaasi rakam detii he
 He said, "how can the government challenge Lakhvi's bail again after the High Court has passed the two-month deadline, when some of its own prosecutors are responsible for delay in the case
" ’ The government hired Lahore's lawyer misbah-ul-hasan Qazi and retired Justice Akram Qureshi a few months ago as the Mumbai attack case prosecutors wanted to actively pursue the case

 ucch nyaayalay ne bhi ghoshnaa kii thi ki yadi nichali adaalat do maheene main or madhya june tak maamle ko sampann karne main naakaam rahati he to vah lakhvi kii jamaanat radd kar degaa
 Although a month and a half has passed since the deadline set by the High Court, the government has not officially said anything about Lakhvi's bail challenge again
 ek varisht sarkari adhikari ne bataaya ki sarkaar dwaara lakhvi kii jamaanat ko dobaaraa chunauti dene kii sambhaavna nahin he
 Originally, the High Court, while disposing of the government's plea, also said that if the defense (lakhvi) lawyers are found to be responsible for the delay in the case, the court can cancel their bail but the ground situation is completely different
 tippaniyan He said that the delay in the case was done on behalf of some members of the prosecution whom the government gives a considerable amount to appear in every hearing
 unhone kaha, ‘ucch nyaayalay kii do maheene kii samay seemaa ke guzar jane ke baad sarkaar lakhvi kii jamaanat ko dobaaraa kaise chunauti de sakati he, jab iske apane hi kuch abhiyojak maamle main der ke liye jimmedaar hai
 ' sarkaar ne lahore ke vakil misabah ul hasan kaaji or sevanivrutt nyaayamurti akram kuraishi ko kuch maheene pehle kaam par rakhaa tha kyonki mumbai hamalaa maamle ke abhiyojak maamle ko sakriyata se aage badhanaa chaahate the

 Chandrayaan was sent from India, which was an unmanned mission
 duniya ke kai desh chand par apane rover yani robotic explorer bhejne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai jisase vahaan kaa adhyan kiya ja sake
 There are only a few countries in the world who have sent a robot, such as a rover, who studies there

 We have reviewed the functional prototype of this rover going to the moon and tried to know how it will be sent to the moon and how it works
 isse behatar tareeke samajhane ke liye hamane team inds ke lead rover sist system ejeeniyar karan vaisya se baatcheet bhi kii he jinhone ise banane main ahm role nibhaayaa he
 After walking 500 meters on the lunar surface, Google will pay 20 million dollars
 This small and powerful rover has been named 'ek Little Hope' (ECA)
 team inds kaa sellection Google Lunar Xprize ke liye bhi hua he
 Under this, this rover will first be made soft land on the moon and it will be run 500 meters on the surface of the moon
 agar yah ECA rover chand par 500 meter chalane main kaamyaab rahaa to ise Google Lunar Xprize kaa vinar mana jayega or google team inds ko 20 million dollar degi
 Vaishya has said that this roverization will be only 7 kg, 'its specialty is that all the rovers that have been sent to the moon so far are very heavy and now China, Russia and America have sent them
 yah 6
 Weighs 5 to 7 kg and is the lightest
 ’ECA rover ke bare main vistaar se jaankaree dete hue karan ne kaha, ‘yah 4 wheel drive rover jiske tahat har chakke ko alag alag control kiya ja saktaa he
 It has two high definition cameras in front which are 4 megapixels
 ye donon camere hamaari aakhon kii tarah kaam karte hai
 By clicking on the photo first, then left and right, you will be able to know from the image processing how the moon's surface stone and this rover will be able to run on it
 This rover has solar panels that charge the given lithium on battery and This makes the motor, camera and processor in the rover work

 Soft landing means that it will land in such a way that it can move there
 spescraft ECA rover ko sataha tak utaaregaa or iske baad yah rover sataha par chalanaa shuru karegaa
 What will India gain from this According to Vaishya, till now there are only three countries in the world which have gone to the moon
 rus, chini or america ke baad ab bharat is mishanke jariye us lig main shaamil ho saktaa he
 India can be included in those few countries
 karan vaisya ne kaha he, ‘ham is mishan ke jariye duniya ko dikhaa sakate hai ki world class technology or awwal darje kii ejineering ye bharat se bhi mumkin he
 At present, India is mostly known as a computer science and coding, software service delivery country, which is not right
 humlog manuphaccharing, technology, electronics or hardware sabakuch yahaan kar sakate hai or yah mishan uskaa pruf he
 How is this moon mission different from Chandrayaan? Karan Vaishya has said, 'india has sent Chandrayaan 1 which rotates in the moon's orbit and is a small device that leaves towards the moon and as it falls on the moon's surface Then he stops working
 is rover kaa kaam vahiin se shuru hota he
 That is, this rover starts working after reaching the lunar surface, so it is different from Chandrayaan

 30 se 35 bacchon se yon duraachaar or hatya kii baat vah sweekaar kar chukaa he
 Still, he narrates the story of his humanity as if it was not a massacre but a minor theft
 itane saare bacchon ke katleam ko bas nashe kii galati bhar maanata he
 Its gesture, the conversation does not seem to make it any less common
 bilkul normal dikhataa he auranormal hi baat karata he
 It also remembers the story of Nithari and the man-eater of Surendra Koli
 padhie isse exclusive baatcheet main isane kya kya sweekaara:1
 i don't remember exactly how many children i killed
 30 se 35 bacchon ko markar unke saath galat kaam kar chukaa hum
 i will tell as the count misses
 krime to maine kiya hi he
 There is no benefit from hiding
 2
 (do you consider yourself a human being? On this question) No, i do not consider myself a human being
 kyonki maine itane saare galat kaam kiye hai
 3
 nithari cond ke bare main suna tha
 He used to kill children and eat them
 sunakar ajeeb lagata tha
 4
 2008 main pehali baar ye kaam kiya
 i had left school then
 main sharaab peetaa tha or flud kaa nasha karata tha
 After that my brain used to get blocked
 phir raat main main ghoomane nikal jaataa tha
 Outside the slums or on the road, they used to pick up children
 unhen dur kheton main le jaakar galat kaam karata tha
 5
 jab bachche chillaate the to unhen markar unki laash se galat kaam karata tha
 i knew that what i was doing with children was wrong
 par bacchon ke rone-chillane kaa mujh par koi asar nahin hota tha
 6
 chote gharon kii diwaar kudakar andar se kundi khol detaa tha
 Then he took the sleeping children away
 do-teen maheene chhodkar main ye kaam karata tha
 In 2014, i had two friends with me in a case
 baaki sari ghatnaayen maine akele kin
 If my family members know, then i will think that i either die or am not born
 7
 i would have done the same with my children if i had the opportunity
 majri gaanv, kanjawala, ghevra mode mundaka ke paas, noida, jain nagar, bhalswa dairy ke paas, narela ke paas, apni buaa ke yahaan, apane mamaa, mausi ke yahaan, apane gaanv main, faridabad main maine bacchon ke saath kaam kiya
 8
 dhai-teen saal se lekar 12-13 saal tak ke bacchon ke saath galat kaam karata tha
 He used to do with the child he got
 sunsaan jagah par le jaakar kaam karata tha
 9
 jab main ye karata tha to nasha karke dimag bilkul alag ho jaataa tha
 i had seen one or two films, which used to do the same with children
 bacchon ko markar unke saath galat kaam kiya jaataa tha film main
 That's why i used to do it too
 10
 Remember the appearance of the children with whom you did wrong
 lekin ilaake ke hisaab se yaad nahin
 Because many places were previously slums
 ab vahaan makaan ban gaye hai
 Everything i did should be punished by death
 mujhe faansee honi chahie

 jail main band argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ke duusare damaadaraahul yadavapravartan nideshaalay ke nishane par aa gaye hai
 The ED has issued a notice to Rahul Yadav and called him for questioning
 rahul yadav ke upar aarope he ki unhone ek karod rupee apni saas rabari devi ko lone ke rup main diya
 On this issue, JDU has said that the Lalu family has become a gang of complete corruption
 party ne kaha he kilalu parivaramen bhrashtachar ke taar ek duusare se judate chale ja rahe hai
 Party Spokesperson Sanjay Singh said that Lalu Prasad Yadav by corruption implicated all the people in his family who were once innocent
 lalu par tanj kasate hue sanjay singh ne kaha ki argedy supremeo ne us jameendaar kii tarah kaam kiya, jiske upar sarkaar ne dabaav banaaya to usne apni jameen naukaron ke naam kar di or yah sochaa ki sab kuch thik ho gaya
 The JDU spokesperson said that Lalu's condition has become like an ostrich, who feels that he has put his head inside the ground, the danger is averted
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki lalu ne pehle apane patni, uske baad beti, phir bete or ab apane damaad ko bhi fansaa diya, kyonki ab lalu ke damaad bhi iskar vibhaag or pravartan nideshaalay ke nishane par aa gaye hai
 The JDU spokesperson said that it is the same thing for the Lalu family as it is to be done
 purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav par nishaanaa sadhate hue sanjay singh ne kaha ki pataa nahin kyon lalu parivaar dhan ke liye itnaa hai hai kyon karata he ? sanjay singh ne kaha ki lalu kabhi kaha karte the ki vah garibon ke netaa he magar aaj ke din unhone itnaa paisa ikattha kiya he ki unase bada bihar main koi nahin he
 JDU said that Lalu Yadav became the leader of the mafias, because these mafias loot the poor of Bihar and feed Lalu
 jadyu ne kaha ki mafiaon ne lalu parivaar ke sabhi sadasyon kaa daaman paise se bhar diya he, jiskaa parinaam yah he ki aaj ke din lalu parivaar kaa koi bhi vyakti arbapati se kam nahin he
 Sanjay Singh said that the Lalu family has probably forgotten that there is no pocket in the shroud
 tejasvi ke shaikshanik yogyata par tanj kasate hue sanjay singh ne kaha ki desh ke lakhon pratibhavan yuva is vishay par shodh karne ke icchhuk he ki tejasvi yadav bina shaikshanik yogyata ke itani kam umr main akut sampatti ke maalik kaise ban gaye ? jadyu pravaktaa ne tejasvi yadav se kaha ki unhen aaj ke yuvaaon ko kuch tips de dena chahie, kyonki yogyata rakhane ke baavjood bhi unhen naukari ke liye sangharsh karnaa padataa he
 JDU said that Tejashwi Yadav, who became the owner of thousands of crores at the young age of 28 years, should take a class in the management institutes of the country and tell how wealth can be created without hard work and without any business

 - Randeep s Surjewala (@rssurjewala) July 7, 2016 On every front, the government failed, before Surjewala opened a front against the government by holding a press conference on the completion of two years of the Modi government
 unhone kaha, 'centre main 2 saal pehle bahumat main ai modi ke netritv membijapi sarkarhar morche par naakaara sabit hui he
 Even after 2 years, the agenda of real governance of the government has not started yet
 'PM ke kaarykram main big bi kii maujuudagi par bhi uthaae the sawalsurajevaala ne piem modi ke sarkari kaarykram menpanama papersamaamle main jaanch kaa saamana kar rahe amitabh bachchan ke shaamil hone par bhi aapatti jataai thi
 He had said that this would send a wrong message to the investigating officers and agencies
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke nirvachan kshetra varanasi ke gaanv jayapur, jise piem modi ne god le rakhaa he, us gaanv ke logon ko bhi 500-1000 ke notebandi ke sarkaar ke aadesh ke baad kaaphi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Here people have lined the slippers
 chappal par apane naam kii slip bhi laga rakhi he jisase koi gafalat na ho
 In the picture, the slippers in the line are actually meant to replace the old 500 and 1000 notes
 ji haa, aap soch sakate hai ki aakhir chappal kaise note badalegi par ye sach he, log subah 5 baje se hi line main lage he 500, 1000 ke puraane note badalane ke liye
 Standing tired, so putting your footsteps or say slippers in the line
 bilkul vaise hi jaise ramayana kaal main jab ram van chale gaye the to bharat ne unki khadaaoon (lakdi kii chappalein) rakhkar 14 varsh raaj paath kiya tha
 So how can their slippers not take 14 hours in line for everyday needs
 is line main kai tarah kii kahani bhi he
 If a girl needs money to go to school, then there is a marriage in someone's house
 tippaniyan People feel that if the note is not received then life will come to a standstill
 shaharon main to card kii sweaping ho ja rahi he
 But there is no swapping in the village market where they have to buy goods
 lihaaja line main lag kar note badalanaa hi ekmaatr upaay he
 Earlier there was a struggle to earn and now it is to change the note
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke god liye gaanv jayapur main pehle bank nahin tha
 When Modiji adopted this village, the bank came
 ab ye bank aas-paas ke chaar-paanch gaanv ke liye bada sahaara ban gaya he
 Obviously, when 500 and 1000 notes are closed, people will crowd here to change notes
 tasviir main line main lagi chappalein darasal puraane 500 or 1000 ke note badalane ke liye lagi hai
 Yes, you may wonder how the slippers will change the notes, but this is true, people have been in the line since 5 in the morning to replace 500, 1000 old notes
 khadey-khadey thak jate hai lihaaja line main apni charan paduka yaa kahen chappalon ko hi laga de rahe hai
 Just like when Ram had gone to the forest during the Ramayana period, Bharat had secretly taught Raj for 14 years by keeping his khadoon (wooden slippers)
 to bhala inaki chappal rosemara kii zaruuraton ke liye kaise nahin 14 ghante line main lag sakati hai
 There are many types of story in this line
 kisi ladki ko skool jane ke liye paisa chaiye to kisi ke ghar main shaadi he
 The comments logon ko lag rahaa he ki note nahin milegaa to zindagi thap pad jaaegi
 Card swapping is happening in cities
 par inhen jis gaanv ke bazaar se saamaan khareednaa he vahaan sweaping nahin he
 So the only solution is to change the note by putting it in line
 pehle kamaane kii zaddozahad thi or ab note badalane kii he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's adopted village Jayapur did not have a bank earlier
 modi ji ne jab is gaanv ko god liya to bank aa gaya
 Now this bank has become a big support for the surrounding four-five villages
 jaahir he jab 500 or 1000 kaa note band hua to note badalane ke liye log yahaan bheed to lagaayenge
 People feel that if the note is not received then life will come to a standstill
 shaharon main to card kii sweaping ho ja rahi he

 daab kya he? dravon main daab kaa kya niyam he? galnaank tathaa kvathanank par daab kaa kya prabhaav padataa he
 Press to know
 daab (pessure):kisi sataha ke ekank kshetrafal par lagane vaale bal ko daab kehete hai yani kidaab(p) = f / a = prishth ke lambavat bal / prishth kaa kshetrafaldaab kaa S
 I
 maatrak n / m^2 hota he, jise pascal (pa) bhi kehete hai
 Pressure is a scalar sign
 vayumandaleey daab (atmospheric pressure):saamanyata vayumandaleey daab vah daab hota he, jo paare ke 76 semi
 Is equal to the weight of the long column
 vayumandaleey daab kaa S
 I
 maatrak baar (bar) hota he
 1 bar = 10 ^ 5 n / m ^ 2 atmospheric pressure is equal to 10 ^ 5 newton / m ^ 2 ie once
 prithvi kii sataha se upar jane par vayumandaleey daab kam hota jaataa he, jiske kaaran(i)pahaado par khaanaa banane main kathinaayee hoti he
 (ii) The ink fades from the fountain pen of the passenger sitting in the aircraft
 vayumandaleey daab ko barometer se mapa jaataa he
 With this help, weather forecast can also be made
 barometer kaa paathyank jab ekaek neeche girtaa he, to aandhi aane kii sambhaavna hoti he
 There is a possibility of rain when the barometer reading falls slowly
 barometer kaa paathyank jab dhire-dhire neeche-upar chadhataa he, to din saaf hone kii sambhaavna hoti he
 Pressure in liquid: The force exerted by the molecules of the fluid on the surface area of the vessel or the surface against the floor is called the pressure of the fluid
 drav ke andar kisi bindu par drav ke kaaran daab drav kii sataha se us bindu kii gaharaai (h) drav ke ghanatv (d) tathaa gurutveey twaran (g) ke gunanfal ke baraabar hoti he
 That is, p (pressure) = hxdx g
 Laws of pressure in liquids: (i) The pressure is constant at all the points in the same horizontal plane in a stationary fluid
 (ii)sthir drav ke bheetar kisi bindu par daab prayek disha main baraabar hota he
 (iii) The pressure at a point inside the fluid is directly proportional to the depth of the point from the independent plane
 (iv)kisi bindu par drav kaa daab drav ke ghanatv par nirbhar karata he
 The pressure is also high when the density is high
 dravon main daab ke niyam:pascal ke niyam kaa pratham kathan:-yadi gurutveey prabhaav ko naganya mana jaae to santulan kii avasthaa main drav ke bheetar prayek bindu par dabaav samaan hota he
 Second statement of Pascal's law: - The force exerted on a part of a closed fluid in a vessel is transmitted by the fluid in all directions in the same magnitude
 pascal ke niyam par aadhaarit kuch yantra hai: hydrolic lift, hydrolic press, hydrolic brake aadi
 The pressure of the fluid does not depend on the size or shape of the vessel in which the fluid is kept
 galnaank tathaa kvathanank par daab kaa prabhaav (effect of pressure on melting point and boiling point):galnaank par prabhaav:(i)garm karne par jin padaarthon kaa aaytan badhata he, daab badhaane par unka galnaank bhi bad jaataa he: jaise- mom, ghi aadi
 (ii) For substances whose volume decreases on heating, their melting point is also reduced by increasing the pressure: eg- Effect on ice boiling point: Pressure is increased by increasing boiling point of all liquids

 The Railway Minister has once again opened the box of schemes for the local of Mumbai, but his own colleague in the Central Government has questioned this box
 in sabake bich local train linon par maut ke aankade puure hafte khatarnaak tareeke se badhate rahe
 From August 15 to August 20, 60 people have died in accidents involving local trains
 somvaar ko mumbai main railway ke kaarykram ke dauraan saamaajik nyaay rajyamantri ramdaas athawale puch baithe ki asi local kab chalegi, lekin kendriya mantrimandal main apane sahyogi mantri ke sawaal kaa jawaab shaayad prabhu ke paas bhi nahin he
 The AC has been lying in the local carshed for six months
 train ke daravaaje, asi, motor kaam nahin kar rahe
 Its height is also hindering its operation
 baharhaal karodon kii is train ke aaraam farmaane ke baavjood railmantri ne danaadan footover brij, escolator, vaai-faai jaisi aasamaani baton kii jhadi laga di
 Many schemes such as double-decker trains, elevated corridors are incomplete, forgetting that done two years ago
 or to or trainon kii frequency sudhaarney vaale cab signling ko bhi red signal dikhaa diya gaya he
 The comments mumbai saurban system philhal fiks block par kaam karata he
 That is, a special difference is maintained between two trains running on a track
 in blox ko signling kshetra kaha jaataa he
 At the same time, the cab signaling included in the MUTP would give the motormen information about the location, speed and distance of the two trains in the cabin itself
 isse trainon kii nirantarata badhati, bheed kam hoti or shaayad local par laga kaatil kaa tag hatataa
 But the minister is currently playing politics on this issue
 unhone kaha yah kaam 15-20 saal pehle ho jane chahie the, lekin nahin hue
 Now it will take time
 mumbai kii local kii pehali jarurat he suraksha
 About 3500 people die every year in the suburban train service, which accounts for an average of nine deaths every day
 phir bhi lagata sarkaar kii praathamikta vaai-faai he suraksha nahin
 The Mumbai suburban system currently works on the fix block
 yani ek trek par chal rahi do trainon main khaas antar rakhaa jaataa he
 These blocks are called signaling regions
 vahiin emutipi main shaamil kiye gaye cab signling se motorman ko cabin main hi train kii lokation, gati or do trainon kii duuri kii jaankaree mil jaati
 This would increase the continuity of trains, reduce congestion and perhaps remove the tag of the murderer on the local
 lekin philhal is mudde par mantriji siyasat-siyasat khel rahe hai
 He said that this work should have been done 15-20 years ago, but not done
 ab isamen vakt to lagegaa

 com / vmgaiurlyr— ANI (@ani_news)22 July 2017 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who once occupied Bihar's power, has announced a complete ban on liquor in the state
 nitish ne kaha he ki bihar main ek april 2016 se purna sharaab bandi kaa kanoon lagu ho jayega
 CM Nitish Kumar, who reached to participate in an event organized in Patna, said that the government is preparing the agenda, which will make the state free from alcohol
 unhone kaha, ‘rajasav prapti ke bahaane nai peedi ko barbaad hone ke liye nahin choda ja saktaa
 Profit and loss are in trade, not in alcohol
 'ek jatke main kiya tha chunavi waadadarasal, beete saalon main nitish ke shashan main rajya main kaaphi aparaadh badha, jisaki vajah se unhen aalochana bhi jhelni padi
 When the re-election riots started in the state, Nitish played bets and promised to impose liquor ban in Bihar
 chunaav jeetne or satta sanbhaalane ke turant baad nitish kaa yephaislajanata ke bich gaharaa asar chhodega
 He said that the government will first discuss with the parties involved in this matter and then implement the rules
 nitish ne yah ghoshnaa us vakt kii thi jab patna main ek kaarykram ke dauraan kuch mahilaon ne sharaab kaa mudda uthaate hue is par bain lagane kii maang kii thi
 After which the Chief Minister himself assured it
 pehle sharaab bandi par khamosh the nitishanithish kumaar ne sharaab bandi kaa elaan to kar diya lekin kuch saal pehle isi mudde par unki raay juda thi
 Nitish had said some time ago that those who want to drink should keep drinking by paying tax, tax money will come in the government treasury, only then public interest schemes can be started and development will happen
 yahi nahin, unhone kaha tha ki sharaab pine vaale apana tarika dhundh hi lete hai
 Sales increased 10 times in 10 years! Liquor business contributes to Bihar's revenue
 sarkaar ne avaidh sharaab bikri ko lekar pehle bhi kaaphi kadam uthaae or nitiyaan banaai
 According to sources, sales of liquor have increased by more than 10 times in the last ten years
 saath hi 2014-15 main isse kareeb teen hajaar karod rupee rajya sarkaar ke kosh main pahunche
 This can be a big problem
 The ban on smuggling in the state can increase after the ban on alcohol
 sarkaar ne pehle bhi avaidh sharaab kii bikri par nakel kasne kii koshish to kii he lekin puri tarah safalataa nahin mil saki
 If liquor is banned in the state, then the chances of illegal business like Gujarat increases
 pehle argedy ne bhi uthaae the sawaal
 
 
 When RJD was in opposition, he also accused Nitish Sarkar's complicity in illegal sale of liquor in the state
 argedy ne thekon ke license die jane par bhi sawaal uthaaya tha, ab rajya main argedy or jediu donon kii mili-juli sarkaar he
 How the two parties work together is a serious matter

 That side is their stay on the Himalayas
 modi ke bare main kaha jaataa he ki unhone agyatavaas ke taur par kai saal himalay par jaakar bitaye
 During that time, even his family did not know where he is, whether he is alive or not and what he is doing? How to reach Kedarnath? There is no complete information about how Narendra Modi reached Kedarnath during his Himalayas stay
 is dauraan kii baaten modi ne kabhi vistaar se to nahin bataayin, lekin belur math or himalay jane kii baat wo jagah-jagah manchon se kehete rahe hai
 According to unconfirmed sources, after spending some time in Belur Math, Modi traveled to the Himalayas, where he lived for some time in Uttarakhand
 kaha jaataa he ki himalay pravaas ke dauraan modi kedarnath ke paas garudachatti main rahe

 After the election results were announced, there was a discussion in the US about how Modi is a leader, what kind of government will be formed and what kind of India will lead that government
 bharat kii hi tarah adhikariyon, kaarobaariyon, visheshgyon or media main hone vaali in charchaaon main jigyaasa, ummid or chintaa sab kaa mishran tha
 In April, comedian John Oliver condemned the US media for not covering India's election completely, yet this time the American media was more interested than ever
 america akhabaaron main sampadakeey or lekhon tathaa samaacharon or kamedi sho main bhi chunaavon kii khub charchaa rahi
 The election results, the presence of celebrities including Modi, publicity in the American style, readily available information, the presence of a large number of American correspondents in India and social media combined to provide more coverage than ever before
 nattejey aane par, khaskar bijepi kii abhootpurv jeet ne logon kaa dhyaan khub khinchaa
 The most prominent feeling in the media has been curiosity about Prime Minister Modi
 unke bare main charchaa to khub hui he, lekin jaankaree bahut kam he
 The question is not limited to whether Modi will be able to fulfill his promise of good growth and good governance, but people also want to know how he will be Prime Minister, mean, practical, reformer or ultra nationalist Bahubali, tolerant or intolerant
 , Will look at America with suspicion or will America have practical partners? The business sense is full of expectations
 bijepi ko mili bahumat ne yah bhav or prabal kar diya he kyonki ummid jaagi he ki nai sarkaar sthir hogi or niti ke maamle main nishchit disha de sakegi
 It is also expected that the business environment will improve and the government will insist on economic reforms, which will bring the sleeping Indian economy into action
 log yah bhi soch rahe hai ki donon sarkaron ke bich sambandhon main garmaahat bhale hi na aae, modi america companiyon par iskaa asar nahin padane denge
 However, there is also concern that the government may not be able to meet the expectations

 There are reasons for apprehension and concern for US officials as well
 pichley kuch maheenon main bharat main kuch samikshakon ne yah jhanda phir uthaa liya ki america bharat kaa sammaan nahin karata or use khadey hone se rokna chahta he
 But in reality, most people in America want to see India succeed and the Obama government has not stopped saying this
 usne saaf taur par kaha he ki america maanata he ki kul milakar bharat kaa udai, ‘‘america ke hiton ke liye
 
 
 For international order
 
 
 vishwa arthvyavastha ke liye acha he
 "it is also being understood that India and America will not always agree
" phir bhi baar-baar kaha ja rahaa he ki chaahe jo ho jaae, america bharat ke udai kaa samarthan karegaa or sabhi dal is par ekamat hai
 Therefore, the US government would like to see a "strong, developed and inclusive India that is closely aligned with the world community" and Narendra Modi has promised it
 is baat ko lekar sawaal or chintaaen maujuud hai ki mukhyamantri pad par rahete hue modi ke saath america ke simit aadhikarik sampark kaa asar kya hoga
 President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security Advisor Swallow Rice have quickly announced that the US is keen to work with the new government to continue to develop a strong partnership between the two democracies
 sarkari adhikari or bahari visheshgy, donon ko america ke liye modi ke shuruaati sanket anukool najar aate hai
 Modi has recently used the words "natural allies" and emphasized that mutual relations are important for both countries
 america ko is baat main bhi aapatti nahin hogi ki bharat apane anek sahyogiyon ke saath behatar sambandh viksit kare or purvi deshon ke saath adhik thos sambandhon kii niti apanaae
 It called it an auspicious gesture to invite South Asian leaders, especially the Prime Minister of Pakistan, for the swearing-in ceremony
 phir bhi america sarkaar or sansad main kuch log aise hai, jinhen sampradayik muddon par modi kii chhavi ko lekar chintaa he
 This fact should neither be ignored nor given too much importance
 america satta pratishthan main modi ke aalochak sakriy to rahenge, lekin unhen milane vaala samarthan ghatata najar aa rahaa he
 There are also widespread concerns about the tide of expectations
 kuch samikshakon ne tulana karne kii koshish kii he ki 2008 ke chunaav main raashtrapati obama bhi oonchi ummiido ‘‘ham kar sakate hai’’ ke vaade or badlaav kii apekshaaon ke saath satta main aae the, lekin ve vaade puure nahin hue
 Despite this, it is expected that the Modi government will fulfill the economic objectives, promises of good governance, inclusive and stable government and India will surely return
 modi kah chuke hai ki janadesh isi uddeshy se mila he

 244 Second Floor (faculty Building) IIT, Kanpur, Pin 208016, Uttar Pradesh abhilash pillai kabhi bhi dil or dimag ko sukun dene vaali prastutiyon ke liye nahin jane gaye
 "melting" text, acting, design and technology, etc
 They present something in such a way that the audience may be uncomfortable
 pandrah saal pehle babarnama par unke prayog ko babar chyavanprash tak kah diya gaya tha
 But he is quite popular among the modern, techno-savvy and students
 landan kii royal academy of drametic arts (rada) se padhe or rashtriya natya vidhyalay (enesdy) main abhinay ke shikshak pillai kisi vaigyanik kii tarah apane naatakon main hameshaa kuch dhundne kii koshish main dikhte hai
 But recently staged with third-year students of the school, the novel Blindside, the play on novelist Srimoyi Piyu Kundu's novel Cut, continued to evoke a deep emotion despite all the elements and tricks of his style
 isliye ki iskaa taalluk mashhoor shakhsiyat or unke rang guru ba

 karant se bhi tha? senior assistant editor shivakesh kii unase lambii baatcheet ke chuninda ansh aap bhi padhehsawaal-shrimoyi piyu kundu ke upanyaas cat ko aapane karant se kaise joda?main asal main bahut dinon se (ba
 and
 ) karant ji kii aatmakatha par kuch karnaa chaah rahaa tha
 And in 2014-15, Srimoyee shared the manuscript of the novel being written on the life of a color worker
 tab maine unhen karant ji kii jindagi ke bare main bataaya tha
 My coming to the theater was also associated with him
 ve living lijend the
 i saw him in Kerala and in Rangayan (mysuru)
 chhutpan main bharat bhawan main hue charchit vibha-karant cond kii khabaren bhi pehle panne par padhata aayaa tha
 Then while teaching in NSD, he used to go to the morning walk with him while staying in the guest house
 ve kehete the ki ''itnaa kuch kiya, par santan nahin, jo ise aage badaye, par shaayad na hona hi acha tha, jo main theatre ke liye itnaa kar sakaa
 "so these things were in mind
 par laga ki abhi karant ji par kuch karuunga to aaj jaisaa rajnatik maahaul he, usamen pataa nahin kya arth nikaala jayega
 When it comes to doing drama with students, it is thought that through this novel, things related to Karant ji can be said in third person
 sawaal- blindside main ek charchit rangakarmi ke khaase utaar-chadhaav vaale jivan kaa kissa he
 In spite of all your experiments, the emotional thread of the narrative remains in the viewer's grip
 to kya abhilash pillai ne apni ek style paa lee he?yah to pataa nahin, par haa, koshish kar rahaa hum
 i will try to break my style if it has become a style for me
 style banate hi aap ek tareeke se sef ho jate hai, ek jone main ghus jate hai
 But Great Artists have taken that style a lot
 sawaal-karant ne rachanaatmak str par aakhir kitna, kaise prabhavit kiya?karant ji pathar or mitti se bhi mujic rachate the
 Used to see creativity in everything
 kehete the, theatre kii koi seemaa nahin he
 Whatever comes new, take it and adapt it to your definition
 ham jaison ke liye vah vichaar ek khidki kii tarah tha
 He believed in Total Theater, everyone has to learn everything, acting, music, design all
 hamaare hi kuch teachers bolte the ki (ibrahim) alkaji kii ek style thi, karant ji ne aakar sab khichdi kar diya
 i liked the style of Karant ji
 sawaal- is naatak main kahani mote taur par samaj main aane ko aap apni kamyaabi maanate hai yaa naakaami?(muskaraate hue) pataa nahin kamyaabi he yaa naakaami
 i love to enter the darkness and find something every single time
 ek scientist yahi karata he, to ek artist kyon na kare! hamane students se class main kaha ki mobile phul charge karke or on rakho
 It was also a shock to him
 ek tukdaa bhejte, chaatr ek kuar code se use kholte
 He did not know the whole story
 20 din sara impruveigeshan mobile par hua, usee par khul-khul kar ye kahaniyaan ain
 Then brought to the big screen and then entered into acting
 to bahut baar prayog naakaam ho jate hai par koshish jenuin dhang se dhundne kii he
 Question- Many color workers / students value your teacher over your director
 kareeb 20 saal se padhaa rahaa hum
 While teaching, the process is important, not production
 isamen kuch chaatr bahut disturb the, class main nahin ghuste the, manochikitsakon ke pesheynt the
 So understand them, bring them, make scenes according to them so that they too can open up
 maansik rup se pareshaan ek student doctor se mil-milke thak gai thi, to use doctor ke hi role main rakhaa, to ek therapy (jaisaa hua)
 We have to see what is good for students
 sawaal-darshakon ke bare main aapaki reeding, aapaki samaj kya he?audiens ko bahut saare chalanges alrady hai
 He is getting popular Bollywood and regular theater items
 mujhe lagata he, darshak aae to uske liye naatak thodaa chalanging ho, use kuch sochane ke liye mili
 a language that forces them
 main audiens ko thodaa-sa push karne kii koshish karata hum
 i tell the students, our meaning should be clear, research should be firm
 audiens bahut samajhadaar hoti he
 If we believe in our actions, then it is possible to understand the things ahead
 par koshish yahi hoti he ki audiens ko ham itnaa zyada simpliphoi na karen
 Question- Fifteen years ago, there was a lot of criticism of your experiment on Baburnama
 use babar chyavanprash tak kaha gaya
 If we think about it today, what do we get? Here we were not able to do a good show but it was good in Japan
 theatre main is paimaane par technology laane or karne kaa confidence hasil karne ke liye vah prayog jaruri tha
 It is now understood that what is energy, mechanical energy and human energy of technology
 sawaal-par aapane naatak mahange bahut padate hai
 i don't need money but yes, for technology and setup
 kharch to he par is desh main aisi koshishen jaruri hai
 After all, there are such experiments in mobile theater and Jatra etc

 unhone kaha,ruthik roshanabahut "sammanit" vyakti hai
 The things that have been spread about Hrithik sir and me are absurd and gossip
 in bekaar kii baton ne tool pakad liya he
 On all this, i would just like to say that this is completely untrue
 maine ruthik sar se bas thodi-bahut baatcheet kii he
 During that time i felt that he was a very distinguished person
 main unka bahut sammaan karti hum
