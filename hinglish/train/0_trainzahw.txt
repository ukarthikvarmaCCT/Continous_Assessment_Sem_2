 The BJP strongly criticized Congress President Digvijay Singh's statement that he was not exposing the cases against the kin of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and former Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani for 'generosity'
 party ne kaha ki use digvijay singh se aisi udaartaa kii darkaar nahin he or vah ‘subooton’ ko saarvajanik kar sakate hai
 Evidence against the relatives of vajpayee-advani: Digvijayparty spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said that we do not need this 'generosity' of Digvijay Singh, these are very petty claims

 It is a matter of corruption, not of family
 unhone kaha ki congress kabhi bhi apane pratidwandviyon ke prati ‘udaartaa’ ke liye nahin jaani gai
 He challenged Digvijay Singh to make public if he had evidence of corruption against Vajpayee and Advani's family
 digvijay yani 'bol kii lab aaazaad hai tere'sitaraman ne kaha ki digvijay singh kii yah puraani aadat he ki ve bade bade daawey karte hai or phir un daavon ko sabit nahin kar pate hai
 He said that this is the character of the entire Congress, it is part of the functioning of the Congress
 aap usase kisi aarope kaa kabhi subut nahin paa sakenge
 Digvijay has claimed in an interview that he has evidence of financial irregularities against the relatives of Vajpayee and Advani but will not disclose them as the Congress is against targeting the kin of rival leaders

 '' Senior BJP leader LK Advani, who was in the news yesterday with his statements about the possibility of a repeat emergency in India, said that whoever comes to power does not want to lose it
 unhone aagaah kiya ki jo bhi satta kaa durupyog karegaa, voter use sabak sikhayenge
 When Karan Thapar asked Advani on the India Today channel that if a politician is forgetful about power or wants to abuse his rights, will Indian voters teach a lesson to such a politician, then the BJP leader's answer was, 'correct 
 ' The BJP leader said that a second emergency could not be imposed in India easily, but cautioned that "those who have power or who can come to power will always have greater sensitivity
" ' He said, 'whoever comes to power does not want to lose it
 jis tarah kisi ko dhan miltaa he to vah use khona nahin chahta
 ' isse pehle unhone indian express akhbaar ko die intervyuu main kaha tha, 'philhal loktantr ko kuchal sakane vaali takatein adhik majboot hai'
 Referring to this statement, Advani dismissed any speculation when asked if it was a comment made in the current perspective
 tippaniyan Advani said, 'I don't know if i said stronger
 maine keval majboot kaha tha
 i wonder whether or not that those who imposed such a terrible emergency in the country have no guilt for it
 mujhe isse ksht hota he
 ' jab adwani se poocha gaya ki kya loktantr ke sangrakshan ke liye paryaapt sanvaidhanik suraksha maanak hai to unhone kaha, 'sanvaidhanik suraksha maanakon kii itani jarurat nahin he jitani satta main baithe logon kii raajnneetik ichhashakti jaruri he

 is bayaan kaa zikr karte hue jab poocha gaya ki kya yah maujuuda pariprekshya main kii gai tippanee thi to adwani ne kisi bhi tarah kii atkal ko khaarij kar diya
 The comments adwani ne kaha, 'mujhe nahin pataa ki kya maine zyada majboot kaha tha

 mujhe hairaani is baat kii hoti he yaa is baat se ksht hota he ki jinhone desh main itnaa bhayaavah apatkaal lagaaya tha, unhen iske liye koi aparadhbodh nahin he

 It is a matter of concern ' Formula Onestar Lewis Hamilton, who calls India his second home, believes that to make Indian Grand Prix successful like the rest of the world, the audience needs to be gathered in large numbers
 maclaren marcidies ke driver hamiltan ne kaha, ‘buddha international circuit duniya ke behtareen trek main se ek he
 To make the Indian Grand Prix more successful, it is necessary that the audience gathers to see it in large numbers
 ’unhone kaha, ‘kisi bhi res ko darshak hi kaamyaab banaate hai
 There will be awareness among Indians about F1
 unhone bataanaa hoga ki sirf cricket hi nahin balki formula van bhi kaaphi dilachasp or romaanchak khel he
 The British driver, however, said that people in India are now taking an interest in Favan and are confident of the second Indian Grand Prix to be held from October 26 to 28
 unhone kaha, ‘yah meraa saatvaan bharat daura he or ab yah desh mere liye duusare ghar jaisaa ho gaya he
 i feel that people are now becoming more interested in F1
 ummid he ki duusari indian graan pre behad safal hogi
 Hamilton, who will replace seven-time champion Michael Schumacher in the Mercedes team next season, described it as a privilege
 yahaan team praayojak vodaphone dwaara yojit ek samaaroh se itar hamiltan ne kaha, ‘main yah nahin kahuunga ki main shoomakar kii jagah le rahaa hum
 He is a great player
 unhen dekhakar maine bahut kuch siikhaa he
 It is a privilege for me that i will drive the car they have driven
 ’ shoomakar is satr ke baad formula van ko alavida kehane ja rahe hai
 In the current season, Hamilton won three of the 16 (canada, Hungary and Italy) Grand Prix, while his partner Jenson Button (australia and Belgium) won two
 satr kii chaar res baaki he or hamiltan ne kaha ki unka lakshya team championships jeetna he
 He said, 'now our goal is to win the team championship
 main jaanata hum ki yah bahut mushkil hoga lekin yadi baaki chaar res main ham chamatkaarik pradarshan kar sake to ummid bandhati he
 In the team championship, Redbull (367) is on top, while in second place is Ferrari (290) with six points more than mclaren
 maclaren ne aakhri baar 2008 main team championships jiti thi
 Speaking about his performance in the season, Hamilton said, 'we have won two to three races every year
 is satr main ek team ke rup main hamane kuch maukey ganvaaye
 The first seven races had some problems with the car's tires
 ye pareshaaniyaan nahin hoti to hamaara pradarshan behatar hota
 While advising Naren Karthikeyan, the only Indian driver in F1, to join Force India, Hamilton said that the joy of playing for his country's team is something else
 unhone kaha, ‘naren ke paas acchhee car nahin he
 There are many drivers in Efvan who should have better cars
 yadi vah agle satr main force india se judata he to uske liye acha hoga
 What would be better than joining your country's team
 force india kaa pradarshan bhi is saal acha rahaa he
 Naren, the driver of the HRT team, is in 23rd place and there is speculation that he will join another team next season

 The film's steadily rising earnings have created strong records at the box office
 relies se pehle hi pre-booking ke jariye 32 karod rupee kamaane vaali 'war' jald hi 300 karod kaaankada paar kar legi
 Considering the film's consistent earnings, it is estimated that 'war' (hindi version) has earned Rs 3 crore on the previous day

 'war', released on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, won a lot of hearts in the country as well as abroad
 kamai se itar film darshakon or samikshakon ke din main jagah banane main bhi kaamyaab rahi

 bataa den ki film 'war (war)' kii kahani 'kabir' ruthik roshan (hrithik Roshan) or 'khalid' tiger shroff (tiger Shroff) kii he
 The situation in the film is such that the Guru and the disciple are forced to collide with each other

 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati on Sunday blamed the Congress for betraying the minorities, saying that the Congress only took advantage of the votes of Muslims
 centre or rajya main congress ke shasankaal main kai baar dange hue or musalamaanon ke saath atyaachaar hua
 He called upon the party workers to win back the BSP with a majority and return to power
 lakhanu ke ramabai ambedkar maidan main muslim, kshatriya or vaisya sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue mayawati ne kaha, "aazaadee ke baad musalamaanon ne congress ko apana hitkaari maanakar saath diya, lekin usne hameshaa musalamaanon ke saath dhokhaa kiya
 The Congress made promises with the Muslims on promises, but gave them nothing but assurances
 musalamaanon ko unke sanvaidhanik adhikaron se maharoom kiya gaya
 The Sachar Committee report is proof of this
 " unhone kaha, "centre va rajya main 40 saal ke congress raaj main meerut or muradabad (uttar pradesh), bhagalpur (bihar), mumbai, bharatpur (rajasthan) main kai dil dahala dene vaale dange hue, jinka muslimon ke man par gaharaa prabhaav padaa
 During the Congress rule, Muslims were forced to live under the shadow of fear
 " congress par bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke prati naram ravaiya dikhaane kaa aarope lagaate hue mayawati ne kaha ki congress ke naram ravaiya ke kaaran hi bhaajapa se jude sanghathanon rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) or bajrang dal ko badhaava mila
 Condemning the Babri Masjid demolition in Ayodhya, Mayawati said that no untoward incident took place anywhere in the state after the court's verdict on the Ayodhya case last year due to her government's sound governance
 muslim aarakshan kaa samarthan karte hue mayawati ne kaha, "hamaari party kaa kahana he ki centre kii sarkaar desh ke pichde varg ke logon ko mil rahe 27 pratishat aarakshan main yadi dharmik alpsankhyak samaaj kii ati pichhadi jatiyon ko shaamil karti he to phir unki aabaadi ke hisaab se usee anupaat main obisi aarakshan kaa kota bhi jarur badhanaa chahie
 "mayawati said," She has written several times to the Central Government that the real benefit of reservation of religious minorities in education and jobs in the country will be only if a national policy is made in this regard and every state of the country People of this society should also get the same reservation facility
 " basapa ko musalamaanon kii hitaishi qaraar dete hue unhone kaha ki basapa sarkaar main musalamaanon ko aabaadi ke aadhaar par satta main bhaagedari di gai
 Giving the example of Nasimuddin Siddiqui, the cabinet minister handling more than a dozen departments, Mayawati said, "during all my four-time rule, the leaders of Muslim society were not only made ministers, but were given fair participation
 " congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi par prahaar karte hue basapa pramukh ne kaha ki congress ke netaa basapa se is kadar bhaybheet hai ki sote-jaagate or khate-pite unhen basapa kaa hathi khadedta dikhataa he
 Reversing Rahul Gandhi, Mayawati said, "with the dwindling mass base, the mind of the Baokhalai Congress has become so bad that its leaders see elephants eating money
" " gauratlab he ki uttar pradesh ke apane jansampark abhiyaan ke dauraan rahul ne kaha tha ki mayawati ne lakhanu main ek hathi paal rakhaa he, jo ghaas-phoos nahin, balki paisa khaataa he
 Mayawati said, "the Crown Prince of Congress tells the people of Uttar Pradesh that give him five years, he will change the state
 garibon ko kamaane ke liye duusare rajyon main nahin janaa padegaa
 i say that the Congress party, which ruled the state for forty years, did not do good to the poor, now how will it provide them employment in five years
 congress ke yuvaraj pradesh kii bholi-bhali janata ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 "mayawati retaliated when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) issued booklets and documents related to allegations of corruption on the BSP government from time to time," the party should spend its energy to increase its declining mass base in the state 
 bhrashtachar kii jaanch kaa kaam centre sarkaar ke iskar vibhaag kaa he or yah kaam bhaajapa usee par chhod de, to zyada behatar hoga
 Hitting out at the Samajwadi Party (SP), Mayawati said that corruption and crime had become part of the system during sp's rule
 vyapaariyon se khuleam gunda tex vasuul kiya jaataa tha
 Slamming the party workers for 'climbing on the elephant by pressing the button on the chest of the opposition', Mayawati said, "you people should win the BSP candidates in your constituencies with a large majority and give a befitting reply to the opposition parties by ruling in Lucknow
 " mayawati ne kaha, "mujhe pataa chalaa he ki agle do-teen dinon main nirvachan ayog vidhansabha chunaav kii taarikh kii ghoshnaa kar saktaa he
 
 aise main aap log is baar 15 janvari ko meraa aane vaala janmdin garibon kii alag-alag tareeke se madad karke nahin manaa paaenge

 kunte ne kaha ki congress ke netaa ne apane bhaashan ke jariye sangh kii pratishtha ko chot pahunchane kii koshish kii
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had said that Nathuram Godse killed Gandhiji, RSS people killed Gandhiji, there is a lot of difference between these two things

 You cannot mass condemn anyone

 The court had indicated that the trial could be quashed
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki ham maanate hai ki rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki unhone mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke liye RSS sanghathan ko hatyara nahin kaha tha, sirf jude logon ke liye kaha tha
 In such a situation, it does not seem to be defamatory for RSS

 He said that we did a better job in Uttar Pradesh, yet our work did not say, the same fate will happen to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 purv siem ne kaha ki bijepi loksabhaa chunaav haaregi, kyonki usne jameen par kaam nahin kiya he
 Akhilesh Yadav said that BJP had said that if a government is formed, farmers will buy potatoes, no one kilogram of potatoes was purchased from any farmer
 kaha tha 14 din main ganne kaa bhugtan karenge, kisi kisaan kaa bhugtan nahin hua
 The Yogi government stopped all our work
 unhone kaha ki jab meri sarkaar satta main thi to uttar pradesh ke gaanvon ko shashakt banaaya gaya tha
 Akhilesh's attack on BJP did not stop here

 When coalition was not held due to fear of Modi, Akhilesh was asked whether the alliance with BSP was due to fear of Modi, he said that this alliance was not formed due to any fear
 unhone kaha ki main mayawati ko dhanyavad dena chahta hum ki unhone gathbandhan ko sweekaar kiya
 At the same time, he termed the guest house scandal as bjp's language
 unhone kaha ki ye un logon ko hataane kaa sangam he jinhone desh ko barbaad kar diya he
 In response to the question whether Netaji (mulayam Singh Yadav) is also involved in the confluence of thoughts, he said that Netaji is the reason Netaji is because he is involved in it

 The Chief Minister's Secretariat is going to stamp its verdict on Wednesday
 rajya sarkaarake is faisle ko lekar raajnneeti garma gai he
 There is a fear of costly treatment due to the private hands of government hospitals
 yahi nahin karodon kii laagat se in aspataalon ko banaaya gaya tha, lekin nivida ke jariye chand paison main ise nijee haathon main saunp diya jayega
 All the equipment of the hospital will also go into private hands
 haalanki sarkaar kii apni daleel he ki aspataalon ke nijee haathon main jane se swasthya sevaaon kii gunvattta main sudhaar aayega, jabaki vipaksh kaa aarope he ki sarkaar ne apni jimmedaari puri karne ke bajaae apane logon ko sarkari aspataal dekar upakrit karne kaa rasta kholaa he
 The opposition also alleges that providing healthcare is the primary responsibility of the government
 duusari ore, sarkari aspataalon kii lachar vyavastha ke chalate beete 10 saalon main dhai hajaar doctor istipha de chuke hai
 The posts of about one and a half thousand doctors in various government hospitals are vacant
 philhal sarkari aspataalon ke nijeekaran se bijepi or rajya ke mukhyamantri raman singh vipaksh ke nishane par hai
 There has been a ruckus about the government's decision to award 9 civil hospitals on contract
 hairaani is baat ko lekar he ki aakhir shahari ilaakon ke hi aspataal ko hi nijee haathon main kyon saunpa ja rahaa he, jabaki shahari ilaakon se zyada kharaab haalat gramin ilaakon ke aspataalon kii he
 At the same time, in an important meeting chaired by the Chief Secretary of the state, the proposal to operate 9 civil hospitals of the state under public private partnership process was discussed
 mukhya sachiv ne vibhageeya adhikariyon ko pipipi mode par sanchalit kiye jane vaale aspataalon main marij ko di jane vaali suvidhaae, shulk, chakitsakarmi, chikitsak, aspataal sanchaalan ke liye anubandhit sansthaae, anubandh kii sharten or anya suvidhaon kii uplabdhta ke vishay main vistrut jaankaree evam kaary yojana banaakar prastut karne ke nirdesh die

 chhattisgarhke shahari ilaakon main gramin ilaakon kii tulana main swasthya sevaayen kuch behatar he
 On the other hand, there is a severe shortage of health services in remote areas, especially in areas like Bastar, Surguja
 in ilaakon main aspataal he to doctor nahin or doctor he to stoff nahin he
 There have been constant efforts to address the shortage of doctors in rural areas
 lekin iske koi achche parinaam saamne nahin aae
 The opposition argues that public private partnership diversion would have been appropriate if implemented in such areas
 congress netaa murali agarwal ne patrakaron se charchaa ke dauraan aarope lagaaya ki shahari ilaakon ke suvidhayukta civil aspataalon ko nijee haathon main saupane ke peeche sattadhari dal kii vyavsaayik bhoomika he

 According to the report, in the coal block allocation, private companies were benefited by 1 lakh 86 thousand crore

 The CAG in its report has also mentioned the stiff competition over allocation

 BJP has said that the Prime Minister should answer on the whole matter

 BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar has described the UPA as the most corrupt government ever

 Murali Manohar Joshi, former Union Minister and Chairman of Lok Lokakha Committee of Parliament, is also serious on the CAG report
 unhone kaha kii unki samiti report kii sachai ko parakhegi or sabhi jimmedaar logon ko saamne bulaaegi
 Samajwadi Party general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav said that responsibility should be fixed and whoever is responsible should be punished

 Ravi Shankar said that the Prime Minister was with the coal ministry, so he could not escape this responsibility

 These three reports will reveal some more scams, giving the opposition another chance to corner the government

 dilli, gudgaanv, kolkata or hyderabad main uske sahyogiyon ke thikaanon kii bhi talaashi lee gai thi
 It is reported that Hasan Ali's relationship with arms dealer Adnan Khashhoggi has been revealed, which if proved, can be imposed on him with very strict clauses
 ye giraftaar is myne main ahm he ki aaj blike mani ke mudde par supreme court main sarkaar ko is par jawaab dena he
 Taking a dig at the Center on Thursday, the Supreme Court had asked why Hasan Ali was not questioned in custody
 sarkaar aaj court ko bataaegi he ki wo kaala dhan rakhane vaale aparaadhiyon se nipatane ke liye kya kar rahi he? He was warned by his daughter and Congress leader Sharmistha Mukherjee a day before former President Pranab Mukherjee went to the Union Headquarters, Nagpur on Thursday
 sharmishtha ne twit main apane pita ko sangh mukhyalay main jane ke prabhaavon ko lekar sachet kiya tha
 Sharmishtha had said in the tweet, "the speech will be forgotten, photos will be retained
 nagpur jane se aap bijepi / aresas ko ko juthi kahaniyaan, afvaahen failaane ke liye khulaa haath de rahe hai or inhen kuch vishwasaneey banaaenge!”hope@citiznmukherjeenow realises from todays’ incident, how BJP dirty tricks dept operates
 Even RSS wouldn't believe that ur going 2 endorse its views in ur speech
 But the speech will be forgotten, visuals will remain & those will be circulated with fake statements

 @citiznmukherjeeby going 2 Nagpur, u r giving BJP / RSS full handle 2 plant false stories, spread falls rumours as 2day & making it somewhat believable
 And this is just d beginning! 2 / 2 — Sharmistha Mukherjee (@sharmistha_gk) June 6, 2018 Sharmishtha's apprehensions did not take even a day to really change her fears
 yadhyapi ye kehane ke liye koi saboot maujuud nahin he ki aisa karaane ke peeche bijepi yaa aresas kaa haath he
 The evening on which Pranab Mukherjee shared the stage with Nagpur chief Mohan Bhagwat in Nagpur, a photo started going viral on social media like wildfire
 is tasviir main sir par kaali topi ke saath pranab mukherjee ko ‘dhvaj pranaam’ karte dikhaaya gaya
 Soon this picture also reached Sharmistha
 sharmishtha ne phir twit karne main der nahin lagaai- ‘dekhie papa, ye he wo jiske bare main maine aapako aagaah kiya tha
 'see, this is exactly what i was fearing & warned my father about
 Not even few hours have passed, but BJP / RSS dirty tricks dept is at work in full swing!https: / / t
 co / dii3nbsxb6 — Sharmistha Mukherjee (@sharmistha_gk) June 7, 2018 Many Congress leaders also started uploading this picture on social media with their comments
 unhone saath main nagpur sangh mukhyalay main kaarykram ke dauraan pranab mukherjee kii asli tasviir bhi aplod kii
 In the real picture where Pranab does not have a cap on his head and his hands are in a careful pose
 ye pataa lagaana mushkil nahin ki pranab jis tasviir main sangh kii topi main dikh rahe hai wo photoshop se gadhi gai
 Nagpur's program was telecast live on all news channels
 akhabaaron ne bhi har angel se pranab kii tasveeron ke saath report prakashit kii
 For the viral test, we decided to investigate what was the original source of Pranab Mukherjee's photoshopped photograph at the Sangh headquarters? After all, who were the people behind this photo? Going deeper into cyberspace, it was found that a large number of this picture was shared on the Internet
 jin kuch logon ne ise sabase pehle share kiya tha, unhone ise apni timeline se delit kar diya
 This further deepened our suspicion
 aakhir unhone ise delit kyon kiya
 If they had uploaded it first, then why did they hide their connection with it? We focused on two people and tried to retrieve their deleted posts
 phir jaldi hi sara khel saamne aa gaya
 Shortly after Pranab Mukherjee's program ended at the Sangh headquarters in Nagpur, media reports surfaced with several photographs of the same
 aisi hi ek tasviir ko mihir jha (@mihirkjha) ne chunaa or twitor par apane mitra @athiest_krishna ko tasviir main pranab ke sir par kaali topi rakhane ke liye kaha
 The two follow each other on Twitter
 ye he jo twitor par @athiest_krishna se kaha gaya- “bhai @athiest_krishna kya aap unke sir par ek kaali topi rakh sakate hai or unke haathon kii mudra ko badal sakate hai? congress iti cell se ek mitra ne aisa karne ke liye kaha he
 "@athiest_krishna in Vizag is definitely the right person to do this trick
" apane twitor profile par wo khud daawa karata he ki main maje ke liye tasveeron ko photoshop karata hum
 But before @athiest_krishna tried to photoshop on Pranab's picture, another Twitter friend of @mihirkjha Abhi Jha (@darrkeaage) did it
 abhi bhi mihir or krishna kaa mitra he
 The three follow each other on Twitter
 abhi ne mihir kopranab mukherjeeki chhedchhad vaali photo bheji jisaki ab har jagah charchaa ho rahi he
 Then Mihir uploaded this picture on Twitter and claimed that a friend of his who was present in the program took this great picture
 ab is post ko bhi delit kar diya gaya he
 When the profiles of these three people were investigated, more interesting things were learned
 mihir ne apane twitor profile par likhaa hua he- “pm@narendramodi kii ore se follow kiye jane par garvit hum
 "if we wanted to know the truth of his claim, we saw that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is actually following Mihir
 uske do anya dost abhi jha (@darrkeaage) or krishna (@atheist_krishna) bhi twitor par kaaphi sakriy hai or unhen bijepi iti cell ke head amit malviya samet hajaaron or bhi log follow karte hai
 We were able to reach all three
 krishna kaa isamen koi role nahin tha isliye nishcint paaya gaya
 Krishna agreed to photoshop photos for fun
 krishna kii aisi kuch photoshop tasviren pehle viral bhi ho chuki hai
 However, Krishna has nothing to do with the above picture of Pranab
 abhi or mihir donon ne tasviir ko lekar apni bhoomika maani lekin saath hi kaha ki iske peeche koi durbhaavna nahin thi or ye sirf maje ke liye tha, jisase kisi kaa nuksaan nahin ho
 Both became nervous when the photo became viral and Sharmishtha Mukherjee commented on it
 donon ne daawa kiya ki unhone kisi party yaa sanghathan ke kehane par aisa nahin kiya
 It was just for entertainment like a cartoon
 is beej aresas ne bhi tasviir ko farji or durbhaavnapurna bataaya he
 There was a lot of uproar during the budget meeting in Jaipur Municipal Corporation
 shahar kii safai vyavastha ko lekar naaraaz ek nirdaleey parshad haji nawab ne safai samiti ke chairman roshan saini par kachra phenk diya
 After this Roshan Saini ran after Haji and Haji hit a table in an attempt to escape
 iske baad vahaan maujuud bijepi ke sabhi parshad un par tut pade or sadan main hi unki pitayee kar di
 Amidst the uproar, Mayor Jyoti Khandelwal continued to witness the spectacle and the budget of one thousand 11 crore was passed without debate
 iske baad roshan saini haji ke peeche bhaage or haji batch nikalne kii koshish main ek teble se ja takaraae
 After this, all the BJP councilors present there broke down on him and beat him in the house
 baari hangaame ke bich meyar jyoti khandelwal tamaasha dekhati raheen or ek hajaar 11 karod kaa bajet bina bahes ke paarit kar diya gaya
 These days, Yoga Day is celebrated in Delhi
 sabase bada aayojan dilli ke dilli yani conot place main ho rahaa he
 But the biggest mess is happening with the health of the youth in every corner of the same Connaught Place
 yaa yun kahen ki dilli ke sabase zyada nashakhor bachche yaheen nashe ke shikanje main jate aapako dikh jaaenge
 When the 'aaj Tak' team was circling Connaught Place a day before Yoga Day, then the youngsters also showed up at the same time
 jahaan yoga de par har jagah swasth bhavishya kii baat ho rahi he vahiin kai bachche drugs se jujhate sadakon par hi dikh jate hai
 But there is also a silver lining here and that is Ali
 conot place main nashe se bigadataa bachapan or ali kii muhimadilli kaa dil maane jane vaale si pi yani conot place main aise bacchon kii bharmaar he
 Most of the children who get intoxicated here are under 10 years of age and intoxication has become the sole purpose of their life
 tajjub kii baat ye he ki dilli sarkaar or dilli police aise bacchon ke punarvaasan ke liye ab tak kisi bhi tarah ke thos kadam nahin uthaa saki he par inhen sadakon par bade hote ali ne khud ke maasoom kandhon par nasha karte bacchon ko waapas mukhyadhara main jodne kaa bidaa uthaaya he
 It has been 3 years since Ali sold flowers to passers by at CP
 noida ke sector 62 se wo roj subah yahaan phool bechney aata he
 Secondly, we do everything possible to stop our children from getting intoxicated
 naash mukti centre ko kol karne se lekar aise bacchon kii pitayee karne se bhi wo gurej nahin karata
 "ali has explained me a lot about not getting intoxicated, he has also beaten me and now for the last two months i have not given up drinking
 ab main bhi uske saath mil kar duusare bacchon ko roktaa hum
 "this is to say that Dilshad, who is 13 years old, and who has now decided to join hands in this campaign, shoulder to shoulder with Ali
 desh kii rajdhani main khuleam chal rahe saste nashe ke kaarobaar par ab tak nakel kyon nahin lag paa rahi he ye samaj paanaa mushkil he
 It is not that the drug trade is limited to the streets of Delhi only
 pahaad ganj, anand parbat or puraani dilli ke kai ilaakon main madhyam vargeey parivaar ke zyaadaatar bachche or yuva nashe kii giraft main hai
 The biggest question among all of these is that what is the reason that the Delhi government is blind to this
 kai bade tourist spots kii sadaken bhi baniin nashe kaa addasbhi bade red lits, mandir, gurudwara or tourist spots par ye bachche saste nashe kii giraft main kaid ho kar bheekh maangate hai yaa chote-mote saamaan bechate hai
 Neither their families nor the administration care about them
 rajdhani main duniya bhar se ghoomane aane vaale sailaani hon yaa phir dilli ke bascindia sabhi in bacchon ke liye kamai ke saadhan hai or din bhar kii kamai kaa ek hissaa nashe ke saamaanon ko kharidne main kharch hota he
 In Delhi people from every corner of the country bring a good future
 khaas kar bihar rajasthan, uttar pradesh jaise bade rajyon ke mazdooree karne vaale pariwaron koroji roti kii talashdilli le kar aati he
 But here these families have to spend their lives on the roads due to lack of facilities and most of these families are forced to beg on the streets
 dilli ke har bade ilaake main chaahe wo rajendra nagar, karol baag, si pi yaa phir india get ho yahaan har red lite par bheekh maangate bachche trephic police se lekar sabhi rahgeeron ke liye aam baat hai or aam he inkaa nashe main duba hona
 Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand won the London Classic Chess tournament title for the first time by defeating British Grandmaster Michael Adams in the fifth and final round
 chah khilaadiyon ke bich round robin aadhaar par khel gaye toornament main anand ne pehali chaar baziyaan dra karavaayi thi

 After the income tax raid, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Kartar Singh was found to have illegal property, jewelery and farm houses
 vidhayak ke daftar ne buudhvaar ko kuch kagajaat saamne rakhte hue apni safai pesh kii he
 Also, unlike the Income Tax Department, it has claimed that Kartar Singh does not have illegal property
 vidhayak kartaar singh ke daftar ke mutabik, 27 or 28 july ko chhapemari ke dauraninakam taxco likhit main diya gaya ki unke paas koi bemaani sampatti nahin he
 The office has claimed that till now the Income Tax Department has not asked anything after the raid regarding the illegal property and the confiscated phone of the MLA has also been returned
 agency ko di gai property kii jaankarividhayak ke daftar ne inakam tex vibhaag kii red ke baad vidhayak ke ghar se jabt nagad raashi kaa bhi byoraa diya he
 According to this, a total cash of Rs 11 lakh 25 thousand 75 was seized during the raid from Kartar Singh's house
 singh ke karibiyon ke mutabik, vidhayak ke parivaar ke paas sainkado acre pustaini jameen thi
 After dividing the property, the property that the MLA has, now has a farm house
 daftar kaa kahana he ki parivaar ke sadsy ke paas jo bhi property he, uski jaankaree inakam tex yaa baaki agency ko baqayada di gai he
 Not knowing the cost of the jewelery, while clarifying the jewelery seized during the Reduction of Income Tax, Kartar Singh's office said, 'the jewelery seized is jewelery of wife, daughter and daughter-in-law
 ' vidhayak ko jewelri ke laagat kii jaankaree nahin he
 According to papers from the mla's office, Kartar Singh is a director in 4 companies, whereas earlier he had been a director in 7 companies
 daftar ne mana he ki inamen se ek company VN Horticultures Private Limited main vidhayak kii property he
 Interestingly, the Aam Aadmi Party has not come forward to give a statement on the illegal property stains on the MLA
 khud vidhayak kartaar singh on camera sawaalon kaa jawaab dene se bachate najar aae
 However, sources indicate that the party is in constant contact with the MLA and the mlas are also seeking legal advice in the entire matter
 upi kii siyasat main tanatani or mail-milaap kii koshishon ke bich shivpal yadav ne akhilesh cabinet main mantri pad or samaajawaadee party main sabhi padon se istipha de diya he
 He submitted his resignation to CM Akhilesh after meeting Mulayam late on Thursday
 haalanki, akhilesh yadav ne mantri pad se unka istipha naamanzoor kar diya he
 Akhilesh Yadav has told Shivpal that he will not let him go from the cabinet
 lekin bataaya jaataa he ki shivpal ade hue hai
 Meanwhile, sources are quoting that Shivpal's son Aditya has resigned from the regional co-operative federation, while his wife Sarala Devi has also resigned from all posts
 ghar ke baahar samarthakon kii bheed, jamkar narebaajiis bich shivpal ke ghar ke baahar samarthakon kii baari bheed jamaa ho gai he
 They are raising slogans, 'shivpal, you go ahead, we are with you
 ' shivpal bhi aadhi raat ke baad bheed se milane ghar se baahar nikle
 There are more than 12 lawyers outside their house
 shivpal ne samarthakon se kaha, 'aap sab hamaare saath hai
 We are also standing by you
 kaaphi raat ho chuki he
 You guys go home, sleep and let us sleep too
 'isse pehle guuruuvaar ko dilli se lekar lakhanu tak dinabhar baithkon kaa daur chalaa
 After the resentment, for the first time, a 15-minute meeting between Shivpal Yadav and Akhilesh Yadav was also held in Lucknow
 shivpal yadav kaa istipha is myne main chaunkaane vaala kadam he ki dilli main bade bhai mulaayam singh se milane ke baad unke sur thode naram pade the
 After this, Mulayam himself along with Shivpal had said that he will not resign from the post of minister
 kaam nahin aayaa koi formulabataya yah bhi ja rahaa he ki mulaayam singh ne sapa ko do faad hone se bachaane ke liye 'sanghathan' or 'sarkaar' kaa formula nikaala
 Under this, it was decided that Akhilesh Yadav would be the electoral face of the SP and the government would run according to him, while Shivpal would look after the functioning of the party and the organization
 lekin takaraav or kadavaahat is kadar haaavee hui ki netaji kii baat bhi ansuni kar di gai
 Of course, it is understood from the circumstances that have come to light that for the first time things in Samajwadi Party have gone out of the grip of Mulayam Singh Yadav
 upi chunaav se pehle party main yah ghamaasan nishchay hi nakaaratmak chhavi pesh karte hai
 But CM Akhilesh has made it clear in front of the party that he is not going to bow down
 
 
 
 So what is certain, in the politics of Bantwaryup, Shivpal is considered to have a strong hold as the leader of the organization
 haalanki, shivpal yadav bhi is baat kaa zikr kar chuke hai ki aakhri faisla mulaayam singh lenge or vah hameshaa party ke liye, mulaayam singh ke liye kaam karte rahenge
 But the way Shivpal resigned from the post of party state president and minister, it is obviously going to be a difficult time for the SP
 akhilesh se mulaakaat ke baad shivpal kii chuppiisse pehle soobe kii rajdhani main paanch kalidas maarg par bhattije siem ke saath chachaa shivpal yadav kii baithak hui
 While leaving the meeting, Shivpal did not make any statement
 akhilesh der shaam pita mulaayam se milane der shaam unke vikramaditya maarg sthit awaas pahunche
 Mulayam has especially reached Lucknow from Delhi to settle the quarrel between uncle and nephew
 akhilesh yadav or unke chachaa shivpal yadav ke bich kii mulaakaat 15 minute tak chali
 This was the first meeting after an open confrontation between the two
 akhilesh se mili chachaa ramgopalaisase pehle guuruuvaar ko din main akhilesh yadav se unke duusare chachaa ramgopal yadav ne bhi mulaakaat kii
 This meeting of Akhilesh with Ram Gopal who reached Lucknow from Saifai lasted about an hour, while Shivpal Yadav also met Mulayam Singh Yadav in Delhi
 akhilesh se mulaakaat ke baad ram gopal ne bina kisi kaa naam liye kaha ki sirf ek shaks party kaa nuksaan karne par tula hua he
 He also blamed Akhilesh's removal as the party's state president
 peshey se teacher rahe ram gopal yadav is samay sapa ke tikat par upi se rajyasabha ke sadsy hai
 Ram Gopal is also on the post of national general secretary and spokesperson of SP
 amar singh or mukhtaar ansaari ke naam par badi dooriyanmulaayam ke chachere bhai ram gopal kii akhilesh se acchhee banati he, jabaki saadhe chaar saal pehle chachashivpal yadavase akhilesh ke rishte us vakt kharaab ho gaye the jab unhen siem banaaya gaya tha
 Even after that there were many occasions when the distance between Akhilesh and Shivpal was clearly visible
 chaahe wo amar singh kii vaapasi kaa masalaa ho yaa bahubali mukhtaar ansaari kii party kaumi ekta dal ke sapa main vilay kii
 Such increased strife and bitterness Shivpal said after meeting elder brother Mulayam that Mulayam is also happy and he too
 akhilesh or shivpal main taaja takaraar tab shuru hui, jab mulaayam singh ne akhilesh kii jagah shivpal koyupi sapa kaa adhyakshaniyukt kiya
 Akhilesh then discharged two cabinet ministers and the chief secretary close to Shivpal
 yahi nahin unhone shivpal se kai vibhaag bhi chin liye

 The package is not expected to be approved when it arrives in the Senate, leaving Congressional Democrat leaders and the administration at a deadlock, which seems no closer to resolving the partial closure

 It is not easy for anyone to understand the social fabric, but Asghar Wajahat has not only understood this complexity very well but the craft of narrating it is also amazing
 ye shabd janemaane sahityakar sarveshwar dayaal saxena ke hai, jinhone asagar vajahat kii kahaniyon ko padhane ke baad kahe the
 The writing of Asghar Wajahat, born of social and cultural concerns, has met any criterion and many critics have confirmed this from time to time
 asagar vajahat kaa naam un lekhakon main shumaar kiya jaataa he, jo is baat ke kaayal hai ki is khubasurat duniya ko behtareen banane ke liye sahitya kii bhoomika ahm ho jaati he or unki is baat ke haq main gavaahi khud asagar vajahat kii kitaab 'safai ganda kaam he' ne saamne aakar di he

 ki ham mugalate main hanis sangrah main lekhak ne hamaare samaaj main faili un baton kii taraf dhyaan khinchaa he, jiske bare main ham sabhi ne apni-apni suvidha ke mutabik kuch gumaan paal liye hai
 It has been assumed that perhaps we have become the best in the world and there is no scope for any modification in it
 lekin lekhak ne chote-chote lekin bade dilachasp kisse or kahaniyon ke jariye is tarah se apni baat rakhi he ki baat dil main bahut gahare utar jaati he or tab ye mahasoos hota he ki ham sabhi kitne bade mugalate main jindagi ko ek dharre main jeene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 While the scope of life is very large, for which we need to learn from the civilization spread in many countries of the world and the cultural fabric of it

 Justice Kurian Joseph, a member of the five-member constitution bench that ruled not to include tainted persons in the cabinet, raised this question in a separate written decision
 nyaayamurti courian ne sawaal kiya he, 'kya koi budhimaan vyakti apni tijori kii chaabiyaan aise naukar ke paas chhodega jisaki nishtha sandigdh ho?' nyaayamurti courian ne kaha ki is baat kaa zikr karnaa asangat nahin hoga ki sandigdh nishtha vaala vyakti shashan ke mahatvapurn ang main niyukt nahin kiya jaae jiskaa kaam kanoon kii vyakhya karnaa or nyaay dena he to phir sandigdh nishtha ke bare main baat hi kyon ho
 He said that a candidate facing trial in a criminal case is also not appointed to the civil service because of his or her alleged criminal background
 ' The apex court has left the issue of recommending the President and the Governor to make tainted persons a minister in this judgment at the discretion of the Prime Minister and the Chief Ministers

 pesh hai pramukh ansh
 The biggest debate in BJP at this time is whether to declare Narendra Modi as Prime Minister or to contest further under Collective Leadership
 aap kya maanate hai?is vakt desh main jis tarah kii aarthik or saanskrithik paristhitiyaan hai, usamen anbhavi haath kii aavashyaktaa he
 i believe that LK Advani should be the Prime Minister and Narendra Modi and Rajnath should try their hand as a cabinet minister
 wo anubhavon se khud ko pukhta karen
 This will be fine for the country
 lekin kai log kahenge ki is vakt narendra modi ke liye demand he?sawaal demand kaa nahin, deshhit kaa he
 Advani ji is healthy, experienced, most senior, he has proved his ability to take everyone along
 narendra modi ko to bahut kuch siikhnaa he
 They should not be spent so soon
 lekin teen turm se modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri rahe hai
 There is a discussion of his work
 gujarat puraa desh nahin he
 There are variations, complexities, many contradictions throughout the country
 un sabhi kaa saamana karnaa, unase nipatna
 He needs flexibility, and skill in behavior, which he has not yet proven
 mujhe lagata he ki adheeratha kaa maahaul ban rahaa he jo na modi ke liye acha he or na desh ke liye
 We interviewed Maulana Mahmood Madni
 unhone kaha ki gujarat main musalamaanon ne modi ko vot diya he
 Do you think the same pattern will be seen elsewhere? Time is the best healer
 par iske baad bhi kya provocation honge, local leaders usko kaise counter karenge, is par bahut-si baaten nirbhar hai
 The situation that is being created in 2014, it seems that there will be a Modi vs Rahul collision
 aap ise kaise aankate hai?rahul ko bahut kuch seekhney kii jarurat he
 It is better not to hurry
 ve jitna zyada ghumenge, utana zyada vot katane kaa bhi andeshaa rahegaa
 We have seen this in previous elections

 In view of the demands of reservation of people of different castes in recent years, the question arises whether these demands are justified or illegitimate
 aarakshan kii maang ke samarthan main yojit reliyon yaa andolanon main baari bheed umadti dekhakar yah sawaal uthanaa bhi lajimi he ki nihit swaarthon kii vajah se itani baari taadaad main log jamaa hue hai yaa rajnatik mahatvakanksha se bhare siyasatdan unhen khinch laane main “kaamyaab” ho gaye hai? yaa berozegaar naujavaanon kaa yah vishaal jamaavada aarakshan kii maang ko unke swatahsfoort samarthan kaa nateeja he? aise sawaal uthaanaa bhale aasaan ho, magar sidhe “haa” yaa “nahin” main unke jawaab de paanaa mushkil ho saktaa he
 Actually, who should get reservation and who doesn't, on what basis it can be given and on which criteria can be rejected, these are issues that have been debated for a long time, but recent protests They have started getting attention due to the demonstrations
 haal hi ke dinon main gurjaron ne sarkari naukariyon main 5 fisadi aarakshan ke liye rajasthan main andolan chalaaya tha
 This movement also became violent and became a cause of loss of life and property
 reportein bataati hai ki 2007 se aise andolanon main 70 se zyada log apni jaan ganvaa chuke hai
 The Jats of Haryana launched a movement demanding that they be included in the OBC category so that they can get the benefit of reservation
 march 2014 main centre sarkaar ne jaaton ko obisi kaa darja dete hue adhisuchana jari kar di, jise march 2015 main supreme court ne radd kar diya
 And now in Gujarat, Patel is demanding OBC status
 telugana main musalmaan naukariyon or talim main aarakshan kii maang kar rahe hai
 The Maharashtra Assembly had passed the Maratha Reservation Bill to reserve 16 per cent of jobs for the Maratha community, but the High Court stayed it
 sawaal yah he ki aazaadee ke itane varshon baad ye maangen kyon uth rahi hai or apane-apane rajyon main aarthik taur par samrudh tathaa siyaasi taur par prabhutv-sampann jatiyaan apane liye aarakshan kii maang kyon kar rahi hai?jat, maratha, gurjar or patel sareekhee jatiyon ke liye aarakshan ke khilaaf daleel yah di jaati he ki in jatiyon ko aarakshan kii jarurat nahin he, kyonki ye na keval shaikshik or aarthik taur par samrudh hai, balki inhen rajnatik varchasv bhi hasil he
 It is often the case that this type of exaggerated talk about the entire community is said without any evidence and the example of two or four successful people of these communities is not given
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki in jatiyon ke kuch log aarthik, shaikshik or siyaasi taur par oonche uth chuke hai, magar aise kaamyaab logon kii ginati bahut kam he
 Such rich people of these castes can be projected as successful figures within these OBC castes, but they should not be used to cover up the bitter truth of the pathetic social and economic status of the majority people within these castes
 yah bhi katai bhoolanaa nahin chahie ki obisi jatiyon ke logon ke vibhinn peshon main jane ke baavjood anya pichhadi jatiyon kii asangat rup se bahut badi taadaad apni aajeevika ke liye ab bhi kheti-kisaani par nirbhar he
 The crisis of agriculture in recent decades "extremely low returns" means their daily life crisis, in which they have to face enormous difficulties
 jab kheti kii upaj ke achche daam milte the, in anya pichhadi jatiyon ne mushkil se hi kabhi rupye-paise kii kami mahasoos kii or mushkil se hi kabhi sarkari naukariyon main jane kii parvaah kii or isliye mushkil se hi kabhi aarakshan kii maang par dhyaan diya
 But now, seeing the high salaries in government jobs, people appear to be willing to leave agriculture and farming and go to government jobs
 yahi vajah he ki haal hi main aarakshan ke liye andolanon main ubhaar aayaa he
 In recent years, the gathering of huge crowds in the agitations for reservation demand is a clear proof of the huge support for the reservation policy
 koi bhi yah soch saktaa he ki in vishaal jansamoohon main keval vahi log aate hai, jo sochate hai ki aarakshan kaa phayda unhen milegaa
 One might also think that these movements are politically motivated
 inamen aadhi hakeekat ho sakati he, lekin baaki aadhi hakeekat kaa pataa lagane kii koshish jarur kerani chahie
 Even after more than six decades of independence in India, there is support for the policy of reservation within all caste communities
 agar aapako lagata he ki baari bheed aarakshan kii niti ke haq main samarthan kaa paryaapt saboot nahin he to ek or pramaan pesh he
 In 2014, the Center for Developmental Society Studies conducted a survey among different sections of Indians, with the result that the majority supported the policy of reservation in Indian educational institutions and government jobs
 jabaki sirf 12 fisadi log iske khilaaf the
 It is true that this support was slightly lower among the upper or upper castes, but it would also be wrong to assume that the upper castes are against the demands of reservation

 kya afsosna ittefaq he ye
 Eight years ago, which gave Mumbai the biggest injury, after eight years, instead of accounting for the same murderer, Pakistan gives it a chance to celebrate independence and cut the cake
 aath saal pehle kii 26-11 wo tarikh he, jo gam or gusse kii kashmakash ke saath baichaiyn karti he
 This day feels like a tear in the eyes of Mumbai
 besharm pakistani sarkaarye aansu ankhon se tab baahar aaenge, jab mumbai ke sabase bade gunahagaar hafiz said kaa ant hoga
 But instead of accounting for lashkar-e-taiba chief Hafiz Saeed, the Pakistani government shamelessly released the biggest culprit of 26 / 11 on 23-11 after ten months of detention
 jashn manaa rahaa he aatanki saidath saal pehle jo hua wo guzar chukaa he, lekin jis gam se mumbai guzari he wo ab bhi uski zindagi kaa hissaa he
 Thousands of eyes that saw Mumbai on 26-11 were constantly in front of you
 ye pehla mauqaa tha, jab khule aam chalati gaadi se goliyon kii bauchhaarein huin
 There were shells and bullets in railway stations, hospitals and hotels and people went on laying like insects
 kaash ye jhooth hota
 But it is a pity that what happened was not a lie, nor is it a lie that even today, after eight years, the biggest murderer of this massacre is not only free but is celebrating his freedom
 aadhi raat ko hua ajadvo das lakh milian dollar inami aatankwaadi hafiz said bilkul azaad he
 What to do? pakistan main rahata he wo isliye sab kuch mumkin he
 His freedom too
 23 november kii raat uske reeha hone ke baad jo tasviren saamne ain, usase pataa chalaa ki kaise aatankwaadi hafiz said lahore main rihaai kaa jashn manaa rahaa he
 In January this year, after all-round pressure, the Pakistani government put Saeed under house arrest
 magar nazarbandi ke 10 maheene baad hafiz said 23 november kii aadhi raat ko chhot gaya
 Then in the morning he reached the headquarters of his terrorist organization jamaat-ud-dawa
 mithai baantkar jashn manaaya gaya
 The cake was cut
 iske baad lashkar-e-taiyaba kaa wo sargana bharat kii tabaahi ke naare lagavane laga
 Pakistan government has hidden evidence of how many cities of Hindustan, as well as the city, can only shame Pakistan for releasing this biggest enemy of Mumbai
 wo pakistani sarkaar hi he, jo bharat kii taraf se hafiz said ke khilaaf saunpe gaye tamaam sabooton ko dabaa kar baith gai
 No evidence was produced against him in court
 alabatta duniya ko dikhaane ke liye court ke saamne ye dhakosla jarur karti rahi ki hafiz said kii rihaai pakistan kii mushkilen badha dengi
 Therefore, it should not be left out
 magar court jab palat kar said ke khilaaf saboot maangati to sarkaar khamosh ho jaati
 Hafiz Saeed has been freed once again due to the kindness of the Pakistani government
 jaahir he apni is aazaadee ke badale ek baar phir wo paristaani sarkaar, sena, iesai ko khush karne kii koshish karegaa
 So soon after getting released, he also announced it
 usne aaazaad hote hi kadave bol bole
 Do not just listen to Hafiz Saeed
 ye pakistan ke bol hai
 Who left a terrorist like Hafiz Saeed, so that the full supply of terror against India should be made
 puraane aatanki agenda kaa vistaarduniya main aisa aatanki desh koun hoga, jo international aatankwaadiyon ko kandhe par baithaata he
 Allows to openly spew poison against another country
 aatank failaane kii dhamkiyaan dene kii ijaajat detaa he
 This started again after Hafiz Saeed left
 darasal, hafiz said jo dhamkee de rahaa he, wo uski dhamkiyaan nahin balki pakistan kii dhamkiyaan hai
 Who is now shamelessly telling the world that he keeps international terrorists
 duniya uskaa kuch nahin bigaad paaegi
 Terrorists used to open rallies yesterday also
 aaj bhi wo bedadak hokar khuleam aatanki jehad kii dhamkiyaan de rahe hai
 It is obvious that this is why it has been abandoned
 hafiz said ko reeha kar pakistan kashmir vaale apane puraane aatanki agenda ko bhi raftaar dena chahta he
 Pakistan is again exposed for the third time when Pakistan has released Hafiz Saeed
 26-11 ke mumbai hamale ke baad bharat ke dabaav ke chalate use do alag-alag maukon par giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 But both were released a few days later
 teesri baar is saal janvari main use hiraasat main lene ke baad lahore ke johar toun main usee ke ghar main use nazarband kiya gaya tha
 That is, Saeed was not sent to jail
 balki usee ke ghar main aaraam se rakhaa gaya tha
 The release of this terrorist has once again exposed the face of Pakistan

 '' aaj (13 janvari) ko punjab or haryana main lohadi kaa tyohaar manaaya jayega
 Today is Saturday and there is also Anuradha Nakshatra of Saturn
 aaj hi til dwadashi bhi he or magh maas kaa pavitra snaan bhi chal rahaa he
 But do you know why the festival of Lohri is celebrated
 lohadi punjab kaa sabase prasiddh tyohaar he
 Traditionally Lohri is a special festival associated with sowing and harvesting of the crop
 is din alaav jalaakar uske irdagird dance kiya jaataa he
 Boys do Bhangra
 ladkiyaan or mahilaayein gidda karti hai
 On this day, married daughters are sent to 'festival' (clothes, sweets, Revdis, Phaladi) from the mother's house
 vahiin, jin pariwaron main ladke kaa vivaah hota he yaa jinhen putr prapti hoti he, unase paise lekar muhalle yaa gaanv bhar main bachche hi revadi baantate hai
 It is believed that the fire is lit in the memory of Sati, daughter of King Daksha, on the day of Lohri
 puranic katha ke anusaar ek baar raja daksh ne yajna karavaaya or isamen apane damaad shiv or putree sati ko aamantrit nahin kiya
 Disappointed with this, Sati went to her father to answer why he did not send Shiva to the Yagya
 is baat par raja daksh ne sati or bhagwaan shiv kii bahut ninda kii
 Sati cried a lot, she was not seen insulting her husband and consumed herself in the same yagna
 sati ke mrityu kaa samachar sun khud bhagwaan shiv ne virbhadra ko utpann kar uske dwaara yajna kaa vidhwans kara diya
 People also narrate the story of Dulla Bhatti on this day, Dulla Bhatti used to live in Punjab during Akbar in the Mughal period
 kaha jaataa he ki dulla bhatti ne punjab kii ladakiyon kii raksha kii thi
 Because at that time rich merchants were being sold to girls instead of Sadal Bar
 ek din dulla bhatti ne inhen saudagaron se ladakiyon ko chhudvaa kar unki shaadi hindu ladakon se karwaai
 Similarly, Dulla Bhatti was awarded the title of hero and this story of his is told to every Lohri

 All of them are in touch with their families
 baharhaal, aise yuvakon par ibi najar rakhe hue he, taaki sahi vakt par uchit kadam uthaaya ja sake
 Now, when the party is getting dirty about 20 mlas, then an attack on Kumar Vishwas is directly done against Arvind Kejriwal
 kumaar vishwaas ne 20 vidhayakon kii sadsyta par chunaav ayog ke faisle ko dukhad or durbhagyapurna bataaya he
 Also said that i had made some specific suggestions earlier, but i was told that it is the privilege of the Chief Minister to appoint people, so i kept quiet
 yahaan par yah saaf he ki kumaar vishwaas ne ishaaron ishaaron main is puure maamle main mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko hi kathghare main khadaa kar diya he
 It is clear here that Kumar Vishwas has put Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the dock in this gesture
 uttar pradesh main chhitput hinsa ke bich 44 fisadi logon ne vot daalaa
 An attempt has been made to loot a booth at Sultanpur in the state
 yahaan police ne samaajawaadee party ke emelsi chandrabhakt singh ko nazar band kar diya he
 This attempt to occupy the booth has been done in Isauli area of sultanpur
 siyaasi rup se sabase ahm soobe uttar pradesh kii jin satraa siton par chunaav hua, unamem rahul gandhi kii amethi seat bhi shaamil he
 But beyond Amethi, the remaining 16 seats are dominated by Samajwadi Party and BSP
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main 17 main se 9 siten akele samaajawaadee party ne hadap lee thi, 6 siten bispi ke khate main gai thi auki ek seat bijepi ko mili thi
 After reaching Azamgarh, BSP President Mayawati raised the issue of terrorism
 mulaayam singh yadav ke chunaav kshetra main apni mahareli main unhone kaha ki jab se bijepi kii sarkaar ai he, musalamaanon ko aatankwaad ke naam par shikaar banaaya ja rahaa he or lav jihad or gauraksha ke naam par un par julm ho rahaa he
 Mayawati has started a series of Maharalis every week
 pichley itvaar ko agra main pehali raily thi or aaj azamgarh main is silsile kii duusari raily he
 Nearly every fourth person is a Muslim in the area where Mayawati was known to the people, and is angry with the tag of terror in her district
 yah sahi he ki ahmedabad dhamaakon se dilli dhamaakon tak, or indian mujahiddeen se iesas tak se jude kai logon ke pate yaheen milte hai
 But it is also true that this is also the case of Kaifi Azmi, Rahul Sankrityayan and Alma Shibli Naumani
 lekin aaj vah kam yaad kiye jate hai isliye aaj yahaan kaa musalmaan baichaiyn he
 Mayawati tried to touch his pain and said, 'muslims have been in panic ever since the Modi government has come
 unke saath sautela bartaav ho rahaa he
 Due to the strengthening of the communal forces in the entire state, Muslims are being exploited in the name of love jihad, cow protection, Hindu nation
 aatankwaad ke naam par musalmaan ko shaq kii nazar se dekha ja rahaa he jiskaa hamaari party virodh karti he
 ' mayawati ne kareeb ghante bhar lambey bhaashan main puure poun ghante modi or bijepi par hamale kiye
 It is said that she wants to be seen fighting the BJP the most so that Muslims can draw votes
 unhone 100 se zyada tikat musalamaanon ko de die hai
 Not only this, she has announced her candidate in 6 out of 10 seats in Azamgarh, out of which 3 are Muslims
 unhone lalit modi cond, maalya cond, puunjipatiyon kii karj maafee, sarkari sansthaaon main aresas ke logon kii bhartee ke liye modi sarkaar par hamale kiye
 Mayawati said that when the people of BSP went to BJP, the condition of BJP was so bad that now this party is not ashamed to take even the rejected goods of BSP and wear Amit Shah strap around their neck
 dalit vot ke liye send lagane ke liye bhi bijepi ke log ghinauni chaal chal rahe hai
 Comments mayawati ne purvanchal ke pichhadepan kaa mudda uthaaya or safai di ki 'tilak taraazoo or talwaar' vaala naaraa unka nahin tha
 He belongs to the upper caste
 unhone mujffarnagar, dadri, mathura or bulandshahr cond ginaae or pradesh sarkaar par araajaktaa or jatvaad kaa ilzaam lagaaya
 On the issue of leaving the BSP, he said, "these people are campaigning that there is a stampede in the BSP
" yah bhi kah rahe hai ki tikat beche ja rahe hai
 i want to ask who is buying the ticket for this party in such a bad condition when there is a stampede in the BSP
 ' The 2012 assembly elections wrested up's power from Mayawati and the 2014 Lok Sabha elections did not give her a single seat here
 ab 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav unke liye karo yaa maro kii jang he jiske liye vah maidan main nikal padi hai
 Now on September 4, his third rally will be held in Allahabad
 mayawati jis ilaake main logon se mukhaatib thim, vahaan takreeban har chauthaa shaks musalmaan he or apane jile pe dehshatgardi kaa tag lagane se naaraaz he
 It is true that addresses of many people from Ahmedabad blasts to Delhi blasts, and from Indian Mujahideen to ISIS are found here
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki yah caphi aazmi, rahul sankrutyaayan or almmaa shibli naumani kii bhi sarazamiin he
 But today he is less remembered, so today the Muslims here are restless
 mayawati ne unki dukhati rag chune kii koshish kii or kaha 'jab se modi sarkaar ai he musalmaan dehshat main he
 They are being treated half-way
 puure pradesh main sampradayik takaton ke majboot hone se lav jihad, goraksha, hindu raashtra ke naam par musalamaanon kaa shoshan ho rahaa he
 In the name of terrorism, Muslims are being viewed with suspicion which our party opposes
 ' In an hour-long speech, Mayawati attacked Modi and BJP for thirty-five hours
 kehete hai ki vah sabase zyada bijepi se ladati hui dikhnaa chaahati hai taaki musalmaan vot khinch saken
 He has given more than 100 tickets to Muslims
 yahi nahin, azamgarh kii 10 main se 6 siton par apane ummidavaar kaa elaan kar chuki hai jinamein se 3 musalmaan hai
 He attacked the Modi government for the Lalit Modi scandal, the Mallya scandal, the debt waiver of the capitalists, the recruitment of RSS people in government institutions
 mayawati ne bispi se nikle logon ke bijepi main jane par kaha 'bijepi kii haalat to itani zyada kharaab he ki ab yah party bispi ke rejected maal ko bhi lene main sharmaati nahin or unke gale main amit shah patta pahanaate hai
 The BJP people are also playing disgusting tricks to dent the Dalit vote
 ' tippaniyan Mayawati raised the issue of backwardness of Purvanchal and clarified that the slogan 'tilak scales and Talwar' was not hers
 vah oonchi jati ke saath hai
 He enumerated Muzaffarnagar, Dadri, Mathura and Bulandshahr incidents and accused the state government of anarchy and casteism
 bispi chhodane ke mudde par kaha 'yah log prachaar kar rahe hai ki bispi main bhagdad machi he
 They are also saying that tickets are being sold
 main poochna chaahati hum ki jab bispi main bhagdad machi he to phir aisi kharaab haalat main is party kaa tikat koun kharid rahaa he
 ' san 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ne mayawati se upi kii satta chin lee or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ne unhen yahaan ek bhi seat nahin di
 Now the 2017 assembly elections are a battle of do or die for her, for which she has left the field

 Delhi Assembly Elections: In these 30 special things, in the results, AAP, which is considered to be opinion poll for Modi, wrote a new speech by defeating BJP and Congress veterans in their own stronghold
 bijepi netaaon ne chunavi haar ko 'jhatka' maanate hue ise sweekaar kiya lekin in sujhaavon ko maanane se inkaar kar diya ki ye parinaam modi sarkaar ke pradarshan par janadesh hai
 This achievement achieved by 'AAP', the three BJP players who saved Modi's honor, is a record for Delhi itself
 haalia varshon main shaayad hi kisi rajya main aisa dekhne ko mila ho
 Only in 1989, Sikkim Sangram Parishad won all 32 assembly seats

 Former minister and Congress candidate Kiran Walia, who finished third on this seat, got just 4700 votes and could not even save her bail
 chunaav parinaam aane ke baad hui 'aap' kii vidhayak dal kii baithak main kejariwal ko netaa chunaa gaya
 Opponents of the attack on Modi also got the biggest blow to the toolkit Bedi, losing to the chief ministerial candidate Kiran Bedi from the Krishnanagar assembly seat traditionally considered a BJP stronghold
 unhone yah seat do hajaar se adhik maton se ganvaayi
 Senior BJP leader Harshvardhan has won from this seat many times with a huge margin
 'main nahin haari, yah bijepi kii haar he'congress ke mukhyamantri pratyaashee ajay maakan ko sadar bazaar seat par raajnneeti main navagantuk 'aap' ke somadatt ke haathon 50 hajaar maton se adhik ke antar se bheeshan paraajay jhelni padi
 For him, this defeat was also overshadowed because he could not save his bail
 maakan ne chunavi paraajay kii jimmedaari sweekaar karte hue congress mahasachiv pad se istipha de diya
 The five highlights of Arvind Kejriwal's speech include BJP leaders Jagdish Mukhi, Ramveer Singh Bidhuri, Krishna Tirath and Congress leaders and former ministers AK Walia, Aaron Yusuf, Chaudhary Prem Singh and Rajkumar Chauhan
 congress ke purv saansad mahabal mishra bhi is baar chunaav haarane waalon main shaamil hai
 Kejriwal to take oath on 14 February Kejriwal will take oath on 14 February at Ramlila Ground
 'aap' netaa mukhyamantri pad se istipha dene ke thik ek saal baad isi maidan main shapath lenge
 There was a movement against corruption in the Ramlila Maidan under the aegis of India Against Corruption
 AAP kii jeet: kuch record toote, to kuch baaki'aap' kii is vijay ne sikkim sangram party dwaara vidhansabha kii sabhi 32 siton ke jeetne or 2010 main jadyu-bijepi gathbandhan dwaara bihar vidhansabha kii 243 main 206 siten jite jane kii yaad taaja kar di
 The aiadmk-congress alliance won 225 out of 234 seats in the state in the 1991 assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, while the dmk-congress alliance won 221 out of 234 in the subsequent assembly elections
 vyangy: kejariwal ko anna hajaare kaa khulaa khatdilli main matdaan ke rujhaan main 'aap' kii shandaar vijay ke sanket spasht ho jane ke saath hi modi ne kejariwal ko phone par jeet kii badhai di
 He assured Kejriwal that the Center would give full support in the development of Delhi
 chunaav nattejey modi kii haara anna hajarepichley varsh may main loksabhaa chunaav main shandaar jeet ke baad hue chunaavon main bijepi ne maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand main sarkaar banaai or jammu kashmir main sabase adhik mat pratishat ke saath duusari sabase badi party banakar ubhari
 After the Delhi results, on Tuesday, some BJP allies and opponents used the occasion to attack them

 Thackeray said, 'delhi has shown that a tsunami is bigger than a wave

 "he said," The election in Delhi is the turning point of the current political situation
 isse pataa chalata he ki raajnneetik shatruta kaa loktantr main koi sthaan nahin he
 The country needs this change
 ' trinmul ke pravaktaa derek o bryan ne kaha ki dilli chunaav kaa sandesh 'bhaag modi bhaag' he
 bjp's ally PMK in Tamil Nadu said that the reason for aap's massive victory was that people were restless for change due to 'corruption' in government administration
 jadyu netaa nitish kumaar ne kaha ki dilli main chunavi nattejey modi ke bare main raishumaari hai or isse desh kaa mood jhalkata he
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said that Delhi has started, the last bet will be for the people of UP
 disambar 2013 tak 15 saal raaj kar chuki congress dilli main apana khaataa bhi nahin khol paayi
 Salute to the people of Delhi: Kejriwal While addressing his supporters, Kejriwal saluted the people of Delhi for doing a miracle to give them a resounding victory
 unhone kaha, 'aapane ek chamatkaar kiya he
 When you are on the path of truth, the forces of the world come together to help you
 main dilli ke logon ko salaam karata hum
 This is the victory of truth
 'bijepi ke liye yah paraajay isliye bhi baari padi, kyonki usne pichley aam chunaav main rashtriya rajdhani main sabhi saaton siten jiti thim
 The party's stance to make Kiran Bedi its chief ministerial candidate was backfired
 bijepi ke liye ek maamuli raahat kii baat yah rahi ki unke purv pradesh adhyaksh vijendra gupta rohinee se jeet gayi
 Kejriwal thanked Modi for his congratulations and said that he would meet him soon to discuss issues related to Delhi

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne duusare daur ke matdaan se ek din pehle ek gujarati channel ko intervyuu diya
 In the interview, Rahul said that the election of Gujarat is going to be one sided
 unhone kaha ki congress netaaon ne mujhe gujarat main zyada campan karne ko manaa kiya tha lekin mujhe kaam main intrest he, rigelt main nahin
 It is written in Gita: Do work, don't worry about the fruit
 main usee ko maanata hum
 Rahul said that the Congress party is an old-minded party, the BJP has no vision in Gujarat
 modi ne gujarat kii janata ke saamne koi vijan nahin rakh sake hai
 Modi either kept talking or kept talking about the Congress but he did not say anything for Gujarat
 rahul ne kaha ki ham log pichley chaar maheene main gujarat ke logon se baat kar rahe hai
 i have worked wholeheartedly for Gujarat in the last few days
 abhi meraa puraa dhyaan gujarat ke chunaav par tha
 Gujaratis have done something new in every dish of food
 rahul ne kaha ki ye chunaav mere or modi ji ke bich nahin he, ye chunaav gujarat ke logon ke liye he
 Congress leaders had said not to campaign in Gujarat, but i said that i will and do not worry about my income
 gita main likhaa he ki kaam karo fal kii chintaa mat karo
 Rahul said that the election of Gujarat should not be seen between Rahul and Modi
 ye chunaav gujarat kii awam, kisaan, noujvaan or mahilaon ke muddon par he
 Rahul said is there any prohibition on my going to the temple? Rahul said that the people of BJP raise this issue
 kya meraa janaa manaa he
 BJP will dissuade this
 main kedarnath main mandir gaya
 i do this, the BJP is getting nervous, are afraid
 koi na koi mudda nikaal rahe hai
 Gujarat has understood that there is no talk of development
 unke saamne mudda nahin mila
 Escape from speaking on the future
 sachai baahar aa gai he
 Rahul said that during a meeting in Gujarat elections we went to a temple
 pujari ne puja kii or bolaa- ye meri beti ke liye? main kanphyus ho gaya? matlab samajha nahin, tab unhone kaha- ye sonia ji ke liye diya he
 When she goes to America, send this shawl with her, then call me after America
 to phir maine unase kaha- main aapaki baat karata dete hum
 He told Momma that he wanted to talk to you
 wo bhi kanfayuj ho gaye
 So tears were coming out of his eyes
 mere andar bhi ronaa aa gaya tha
 Rahul said that the more criticism i get, the stronger i am becoming
 unhone kaha ki mai modi ji se nafrat kar hi nahin saktaa hum
 Rahul said that my image is not a makeover
 rahul gandhi kii ye sachai he
 The BJP stopped him with money and his workers
 bahut paisa laga
 Many people were planted
 image ko kharaab karne ke liye
 i speak the truth
 uske wo roak nahin paae, mekaover kuch nahin hua he
 Rahul said who am I
 maine sirf gujarat kii aawaaj uthaai he
 BJP is afraid of the public
 unhone kaha ki mere or modi ke bich chunaav nahin he
 Feeling of Gujarat is an election
 maine sirf pyaar se logon se gale mila, jo suna bolaa
 i spoke to the merchants of Surat and spoke to the tribals
 usase wo dar rahe hai
 They are scared, nervous by what Gujarat is saying
 rahul ne kaha ki jo mere pardada, daadi yaa papa or maa hon, in sabhi se ye desh hamase bada he
 Listen to this expression of this country, understand it and do whatever can be helped from the heart
 pad se koi matlab nahin he
 Whatever the post, if there is no emotion inside, nothing will happen
 agar kisi insaan ko dekhte hai din bhar kaam kar rahaa he to uski kathinaayee he, uske dard ko samajhane main bahut fark hota he
 The pain of the farmer on joining hands is understandable
 ye ek feeling he
 The judge had asked the police whether the matter had been investigated

 He then went on to Aligarh Muslim University, from where he studied law and earned a Bachelor of Law degree in 1974
 aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay se hi ajam khan ne raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa
 He joined the Janata Party in 1976 and did district level politics
 iske baad jald hi vah chunavi raajnneeti main aa gaye or 1980 main unhone vidhansabha kaa chunaav jeeta
 After this, the sequence of his victory started, he continued to progress election-by-election
 vah kul 9 baar vidhayak ban chuke hai
 While has been a minister in the UP government five times
 ajam khan apane shahar rampur se hi king banate rahe hai
 He contested and won the first election on Rampur seat in 1980 on a Janata Party (secular) ticket
 iske baad 1985 main vah lokdal ke tikat par jitkar aae
 He won on a Janata Dal ticket in 1989 and was elected from the Janata Party in 1991
 darasal, janata party main vikharaav ke kaaran vah 80 ke dashak main kai dalon main aate jate rahe
 Fought on SP ticket in 1993, Mulayam Singh Yadav formed Samajwadi Party in October 1992 and Azam Khan got on SP ticket in 1993 UP Assembly Elections
 is chunaav main vah jeet gaye
 But in 1996 Afroz Ali Khan won the Congress ticket from Rampur
 is bich ajam khan 1996-2002 tak rajyasabha ke sadsy rahe
 Muslim face in up's politics, Aajam Khan is recognized as the biggest Muslim face in UP
 vah hameshaa pradesh va desh ke musalamaanon se jude maddon par apni raay rakhte hai
 However, many times his statements are the cause of controversy
 samaajawaadee party se musalamaanon ko jodne kaa shrey bhi ajam khan ko hi jaataa he
 When Azam Khan became a cabinet minister for the first time in 1989, he was given the responsibility of Muslim Waqf and Haj Department besides Labor and Employment
 1994 main vah bharat ke alpsankhyak forum ke adhyaksh bhi bane
 Their confrontation was also seen inside the party
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main vah sapa kii ummidavaar jaya pradaa ke khilaaf khadey najar aae, unhone jamkar jaya pradaa kaa virodh kiya
 Subsequently, on 17 May 2009, he resigned from the post of General Secretary of the party
 haalanki, jald hi 4 disambar 2010 ko party ne unka nishkasana radd karte hue waapas bula liya
 Azam Khan's great stature is among the tall leaders of UP
 vah mulaayam singh yadav ke sabase puraane saathiyon main hai
 When Akhilesh Yadav became the chief minister in 2012, Azam Khan also served as a cabinet minister in his government
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main jab bhartiya janata party ne ekatarfa jeet darj karte hue 324 siton par kabja jamaaya to us sthiti main bhi ajam khan apni seat bachaane main kaamyaab rahe
 Not only this, he also ensured the victory of his son Abdullah Azam for the first time from the Swar seat
 rajya main ho rahi chunavi bahason kaa mudda is baar yah he ki kya vamadal desh kaa apana aakhri garh bachaa paaenge or kya bhaajapa sabarimala mudde par matadaataaon ke bich itnaa dhruvikaran karne main kaamyaab rahi he ki aakhirkaar vah bhi is rajya main kuch siton par hi sahi, lekin mukaable main khadi najar aae
 Nothing clear yet
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ghoshnaa kii ki ve rajya kii pahari seat vynad se bhi chunaav ladenge
 After this, the sharp reaction of BJP and Left parties came out but soon the dust settled on that debate and Kerala has started asking basic questions back to political parties
 ab tak sipii (em) kii aguai vaale ldf or congress kii aguai vaale united democratic front (udief) ke bich hi sidhi ladaai (2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main ldf ne aath siten or udief ne 12 siten jiti thim) hoti thi lekin is baar bhaajapa apni upasthiti darj kara rahi he to mukaable main teesraa kone bhi khulne kii ummid he
 Although the BJP will be seen challenging in a few constituencies, it is so clear that it is ready to make a dent in the vote bank on both fronts
 ldf pinarai vijayan sarkaar ke sushasan ke record par chunaav jeetne kii aas main he, jabaki sabarimala mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh par virodh pradarshnon or baadh ke baad kerala ke punarnirmaan par hue vivaadon se kinaaraa karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 On March 9, the LDF started the election campaign, announcing the candidates
 vijayan, jo ummidavaaron ke naam par antim muhar lagaayenge, ne congress or indian union muslim lig (aayiumail) ke haath se siten jhatakane ke liye uttari kerala main lokapriy apane chaar vidhayakon ko maidan main utaara he
 The LDF has also played a Hindu card to win SC / ST reserved seats with the dominant Ezhava community
 vidhansabha or upachunaav haarane ke baad udief ke paas khud ko punerjeevit karne kaa ek or mauka hoga
 Congress cadre should be expected to be encouraged by Rahul Gandhi contesting from Kerala
 rajya main bhaajapa ke liye bhi yah paanv jamaane yaa hameshaa ke liye ukhd jane jaisi sthiti rahegi
 The BJP has given five seats to the Bharat Dharma Jan Sena representing the Ezhava community and one to the Kerala Congress (thomas)
 saamaajik samikarnon ko sadhate hue naadar samudaay kii rajnatik ikai, vaikunthaswami dharm prachaaran sabha or nader seva socity ko bhi saath liya he jo ab tak congress kii hamdard thi
 There is speculation that this alliance may be most effective in Thiruvananthapuram seat, which the BJP almost snatched from Shashi Tharoor (congress) in 2014
 is baar tiruvanantpuram se aresas ke diggaj netaa kummanam rajasekharan bhaajapa kii ore se maidan main utre hai
 The BJP has put the bet right, but if it fails to win this seat even after the Sabarimala controversy, then its future cannot be bright
 siyaasi surmapinarai vijayan ne vamadalon ke chunaav abhiyaan kii kamansambhaal rakhi he or ve jamini ranneeti bana rahe hamrahul gandhi congress adhyaksh kii upasthiti se party main gutbaji tham sakati he, cader ekajute hokar chunaav main utar saktaa hapi

 *** After years of playing with chokes, South African captain AB d'villiers announced that this time the World Cup is theirs
 newjiland ke khilaaf2015 cricket world kapke semifinal kii purv sandhya par di’williars puri tarah se aashwast hai
 Both teams have never reached the World Cup finals before
 di’williars ne kaha, ‘ham aatmavishvaas se bhare hai
 i think the team is in a good rhythm at a very good time
 aatmavishvaas se bhare hone ke kai kaaran hai
 'd'villiers said,' If we play to our full potential then no one can stop us in this tournament

 Prior to this, both teams have played six times in the World Cup, out of which New Zealand won four matches and lost two matches
 donon tiimon ke bich world cap main hue pichley teen mukaable newjiland ne jite hai
 d'villiers, however, has no interest in history and said that what matters to him is how his 2015 team performs
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaare ateet or world cap main dakshin africa ke acha pradarshan nahin karne ko kaaphi tavajjo di ja rahi he
 We know that if we play good cricket we will win

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh will share its feedback with the BJP on May 19 next day after the last phase of voting on May 19
 isi feedback ke aadhaar par sangh 3 trek ranneeti tay karegaa
 According to the information received from Sangh sources, the feedback that the Sangh has received after 6 phases of voting is not matching with the feedback received by the BJP
 bhaajapa apane feedback main jahaan yah daawa kar rahi he ki is baar 2014 ke 282 siton se zyada par party apni jeet hasil karegi vahiin sangh kaa aankalan he ki 2014 ke mukaable bhaajapa ko kaaphi sankhya main siton kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he
 The Sangh has analyzed the 2014 and 2009 Lok Sabha election data
 iske mutabik 2014 main bhaajapa ne 282 siten jiti thi jinamein 239 siton par jeet kaa antar, tisare number par rahe pratyaashee ko mili vot se kam tha
 For example, the BJP secured 100 votes while number one, and a party secured 40 votes while in the third position, the candidates who finished second got more than 60 votes
 is lihaaj se 239 siton par vipakshi dalon ke gathbandhan or jahaan sidhaa takkar congress yaa anya dalon se he vah seat bhaajapa ke haathon se nikal jaae iski sambhaavna adhik he
 In such a situation, the Sangh is brainstorming on three options
 pehle vikalp ke tahat endie kaa sarkaar modi ke netritv main banane ke liye kshetreey partiyon ko apane khemen main karne kii koshish karnaa
 The association may suggest assigning responsibility to a senior leader to do this work
 vikalp do ke rup main yadi anya dal aane ko raji nahin hote he us dasha main modi or shah ko is baat ke liye sangh raji kar saktaa he ki vah apni jagah netritv party ke kisi anya netaa ko saunpane par raji ho
 In order to persuade Modi and Shah, responsibility can be given to Bhaiyyaji Joshi, the head steward of the Sangh
 tisare vikalp ke rup main sangh is baat ke liye modi or shah ko raji karne kii koshish karegaa ki yadi vipaksh main baithne ke alaava anya vikalp nahin bachate hai to phir netaa pratipaksh or party ke rashtriya adhyaksh ke rup main modi or shah kii jodi kii jagah kisi anya netaa ko jimmedaari saunpi jaae

 Let me tell you that the pontoon bridge is a temporary bridge that is used when needed and is kept in place when the need is met
 police ne maamla darj kar liya he lekin dindahaade or fursat main hui is chori ne bataaya he ki dilli main kuch bhi chori ho saktaa he
 The police have registered a case but this theft in the broad daylight and leisure has told that anything can be stolen in Delhi
 dilli ke archbishap anil kuto kii ore se likhi ek chitthee ko bhaajapa ne apni sarkaar kii aalochana bataaya he
 It was written in this letter that the country has a "discordant political environment, which is democratic values
 
 And there is danger to the secular fabric of the nation
 '' grahamantri rajnath singh ne sweekaar kiya ki unhone us chitthee ko nahin dekha he lekin logon ko aashwast kiya ki ''bharat un deshon main se ek he jahaan alpsankhyak surakshit hai or kisi ko bhi jati or dharm ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav karne kii ijaajat nahin he
 "minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that the incidents have been viewed in a biased view
 unhone kaha, ''hamen yah dekhnaa chahie ki pradhanmantri kisi bhedbhaav ke bina vikaas ke liye patibaddh hai
 You will not see this progress as long as you suffer from prejudice
 '' bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi is patr kaa ullekh ek patrkaar vaarta main karte hue kaha, ''kisi ko bhi dharm ke aadhaar par logon ke dhruvikaran kii baat nahin kerani chahie
 '' Tourism Minister

 Alphonso said that 'religious leaders' should stay away from politics
 or iske baad sookshm, laghu or majhole udhyam mantri giriraaj singh bhi maidan main kud pade
 He uttered howling in the manner of playing the bugle of war, "the Church wants to create a state of civil war in the country
" ''aapako lagegaa ki yah shaayad unki gusse main kii gai pratikriya thi
 But they did not stop here
 giriraaj singh ne dhamkee bhare andaaj main kaha, ''har kriya kii ek pratikriya hoti he
 i will not take a single step which spoils the communal harmony
 lekin carch agar logon se yah prarthana karne ke liye kahata he ki modi sarkaar na banane paae, to duusare dharmon ke log kirthan-puja karenge taaki modi sarkaar bane
 No political party was named in Cueto's letter
 yah niraashaa or ummid main kii gai ek apil he, jisamen 2019 ke aam chunaavon se pehle har shuukravaar ko prarthana or upwas rakhane kaa aahvaan kiya gaya he
 After all, why has the BJP taken so personal an appeal from any archbishop to pray for Catholics for their country? This letter is written on 8 May which could easily be ignored
 is patr par itnaa ho-halle ke kaaran kuto ko bolnaa hi padaa ki unka patr rajnatik nahin tha balki dharmik upadesh dene kaa prayaas tha
 The archbishop and his secretary, Father Robinson, have both stated that their intention was not to criticize any political party or government
 kya bhaajapa is kadar khoi hui he ki use kuto ke shabdon main ''desh ke dharmanirpeksh taane-bane ke liye khatra'' dikhaai nahin de rahaa he
 His words can also be considered as sarcasm on the Congress because it is also politically interested in the Hindutva line
 is patr ko lekar pratikriyaayein dene main kisi se peeche na rahete hue goa main congress ke ek purv netaa saviyo rodrigs ne twit kiya ki media ko ''dilli ke archbishap ke is sampradayik bayaan'' ko dikhaanaa chahie
 Rodriguez said, "do they mean 'defeat the Hindu forces'"
 kya ve kahana chaahate hai ki hindustan ke liye hindu bure hai?''archbishap ke patr main kahin bhi hinduon yaa tathakthith hindu takaton kaa ullekh nahin he
 His instructions in the letter, which were to be confined only to the clergy of his region, are in very soft words
 to kya iskaa matlab yah he ki patr ko lekar kiya ja rahaa ho-hallaa raajnneeti se prerit he or ise jarurat se zyada tool diya ja rahaa he? a case has been registered against five employees of a transport company and owner of a bus terminal under the blasphemy law for insulting the turban of a Sikh person in Pakistan's Punjab province

 kuch yatriyon ke mutabik, singh ne police ko bataaya ki yah apavitrikaran kaa maamla he or vah pakistani naagarik hai, isliye hamalaavaron par ish ninda kanoon ke tahat maamla darj kiya janaa chahie

 His specialty is his grip on his language, craft and plot
 bundeli par unki pakad kaa kya kahana? vah isi ilaake main paley bade to apane lekhan main is boli ko bhashaayi aadhaar diya, lekin likhte vakt vah utani hi aasaani se ‘dhirasamire’ main brajabhasha or ‘paanch aanganonvala ghar’ or ‘pagalaa baba’ main banarsi-bhojpuri main bhi sarak jate hai
 He has his own distinct identity in contemporary fiction - a presence that makes sense of an entire litterateur, whose writing is of paramount importance, whose concerns rise from contemporary society to the context of a 'man on earth' and whose The writing pane, the rough reality of 'red yellow ground', the softness and poeticity of 'tumara Roshni Mein', the discovery of the Indian tradition of 'dhirsamire', 'huzur Durbar' and 'five ँgnonwala history of the house and Pdtal- today's questions in the context of past boasts together
 govind mishra iskaa shrey apane khulepan ko dete hai
 There are very few litterateurs whose 'range' is so wide and whose number of characters created is above thousand
 unki kahaniyon main ek taraf ‘kachakundh’ ke ganwai gaanv ke master sahab hai to ‘maaykele lobo’ jaisaa aadhunik paatr yaa ‘khak itihaas’ kii videshi maaria bhi

 The almost inhuman and inertial world is one of the main concerns of the writings of Govind Mishra, where he presents only an inside-out raw letter of an environment, even where there is a lack of creative humanism and values
 is
 govind mishra ke lekhan kaa mul swar sakaaratmak he, jo unki rachanaaon main uttarottar saaf hota chalaa gaya he
 'he Apna Face' is a quest that starts from faces to ethics and values through life-style and beliefs, the bureaucratic environment, the daft mentality, the world of files and buildings are brought up through such a tension here Which is as fiery as its nature of waste-red tape
 yahan chehre bhi filon kii tarah gum rahe hote hai, 'apana’ cheharaa 'vah’ ho jaataa he, vahi jiske khilaaf uski ladaai thi
 The characters' deep grip, artistry, and a roughness of language make this novel distinctive
 aaj govind mishra ke janmdin par sahitya ajtak par padhie unke upanyaas vah apana cheharaa kaa anshpustak anshah vah apana cheharaarachana kaa daftar khaali tha kyonki sava paanch ho chuke the, or sarkari daftaron se log-baag vakt ke kuch pehle hi nikal padate hai taaki bason kii kyuu main aage khadey ho saken
 The elevators were also closed, so the stairs had to be held
 maine sochaa amaru se poochhun- 'vah is vakt milegi bhi, phone kiya tha yaa nahin?’ par main haanf rahaa tha tab or vah apni lambi-lambi taangon kii vajah se kuch mujhase aage hi tha
 i did not want to call from behind
 
 
 phir vah har haalat main upar to jayega hi dekhne, isliye main sirf uske peeche ghistata rah saktaa tha, philhal
 Rachna was not in her room
 vahaan keshavadas baitha hua tha
 An important officer of our department
 umr chappan ke paar
 The heavier the position, the heavier the body
 lambe-chaude pathan kii lathi thi vah
 
 
 
 kasi hui hoti to aakarshak lagati
 Was a fuser
 
 
 dhili bandhi kisi moti gathree-sa
 
 
 Something originates here, something flows there
 
 
 kareeb-kareeb bhadda
 We both knew him
 main to khaasaa ghanishtha tha, par tab us jagah tirchhi mej par kaagajon ke upar jhukaa hua vah mujhe bhi ajanabi hi laga
 We knew that he used to sit in the main building of the Secretariat and we did not imagine him to be there then
 kuch udate hue kisse jarur the- rachana or uske sambandh kaaphi kareeb ke bataae jate the
 Rachna was getting every good deployment ahead of time
 
 
 iske peeche jo raaj tha vah uskaa keshavadas se sambandh bataaya jaataa tha
 i did not prefer those things more than some baseless news because the news in the building where we used to work used to fly! No one knew where she used to get up or that she would fly away
 baad main 'agar aisa he bhi to mujhe kya’ sochakar main un kisson se alag ho gaya tha- keshavadas se mere sambandh rachana ke baavjood the or ve jis had tak the, thik the
 My relations with Rachna remained only nominal
 ‘dost’ se utarkar sirf 'parichit’ ke rah gaye the or main unhen or nahin bigaadna chahta tha
 
 
 Amaru hiccup, came out, read the composition name again on the board and started looking at me with a little surprise
 ''aaie
 
 
 Come
 
 
 "keshavadas ne hamen dekh liya tha or jaise hi ham bhaagane ko hue, peeche se hamen bulaayaa
 If there had been someone else in his place, i would have hesitated in that situation, would have tried to avoid it and it was very possible, we would have gone a little by looking around
 lekin keshavadas aisa nahin tha, yah main jaanata tha
 He was too rude for that kind of civilized-decent behavior
 ''kya rachanaji
 
 ?"amaru ne hami bhari, main peeche hi bana rahaa
 "sit down, they just come
" 
 
 "ham baith gaye
 Keshavdas bent over his papers, lifting his head from the papers whenever he looked at me
 tab mujhe aisa lagata jaise vah dekhtaa nahin tha, ghurta tha- jaise usne mujhe koi galat kaam karte hue pakad liya ho
 At the same time, he would have avoided avoiding the matter like a simple thing with the same eyes
 vah amaru ko nahin jaanata tha, maine parichay karaayaa
 After joining hands, Keshavdas smoked a cigarette and put his gold-flak packet towards me
 ''thanks, mere paas he
 
 
 "'" Here you drink me
 "usne mere wills ke packet ko kuch is tarah hikaarat-bhari najaron se dekha ki mujhe laga ki main usase pehali baar mil rahaa hoon
 My informal intimacy with him for days was swept away
 vah apane daftar main is kadar aupchaarik ho baithta to or baat thi
 What does he show in the composition room? 
 
 uskaa cigarette kaa packet is tarah phenk dena jo iske ghar main acha lagata yahan gad rahaa tha
 
 
 But then i started thinking something else - that the level of things, their price is spontaneous, otherwise i know very well that at least cigarettes have their own place
 charminar main jo ek khaas kism kaa tikhaapan hota he, usamen buddhivaadiyon or krantikariyon ke panepan kaa ahsaas bhi swat: chipa hota he phir bhi use log bhukhmaree or bekaari se jod dete hai
 
 
 He probably wanted to show that he is a better officer than us
 ''main 'riforms kamishan’ kaa ek 'chapter’ likh rahaa hoon jo is vibhaag se taalluk rakhata he
 
 
 "he started telling Amaru
 pataa nahin vahaan apni upasthiti kii vajah bataa rahaa tha yaa apni dhak baitaane main laga hua tha
 "the position of the officer of this department is a spider-like trap trapped in the web - public on this side, his staff is always in a circle to kill him legally, here c
 bi
 I
 uski har cheez ko shaq se dekhtaa hua, idhar kamishnar- ek khaas khushaamad kii ummid karata hua
 
 
 From here on the board was instructing him on instructions
 
 
 "vah ek kaagaj par jalanuma koi khaakaa banaata ja rahaa tha
 i saw that his handwriting was small and quite uninteresting, the handwriting could reflect his heavy body
 mujhe apana pehla sahakaari yaad aayaa jisane mere hastakshar dekhakar hi meraa khaakaa khinch daalaa tha, mujhe dekhne se pehle hi
 Probably obese people will be obsessed with their body, so always write short - Gichpich
 vah tikadmi to nahin tha
 
 
 i gave up trying, do you know if he is just being pulled or is he really thinking about his chapter? uski ungliyaan kaanpati thim
 
 ajeeb baat thi ki maine yah pehle kabhi gaur nahin kiya tha
 
 
 Maybe today they are trembling too much, so i can look different
 ve kaanpati thim, cigarette pite vakt or bhi
 
 
 In a strange way
 
 
 jaise parkisans dijis ke marij kii kaanpati hai
 This led to a clumsiness around him
 mujhe ubaas aane lagi, amaru kii taraf dekha
 Amaru was looking at her with some smiles, some applause, would be in a daze to impress her in the first meeting itself! In such a pose, i will look foolish like Amaru, but this is our common 'pose'
 
 
 
 While entering the room, i first saw Rachna as i was sitting here and was neutral with her words at the moment
 vah bade hi swaabhaavik dhang se andar ghusi thi par hamen vahaan dekhakar ekaek hi thithak gai
 Just then, a soot ran on her face
 
 
 vah kaalikh- halki-si syaahi kahana thik hoga- bade hi saaf dhang se chehre ko dhundla banaati uthi or chehre-bhar main failati chali gai
 Amaru must have also seen
 rachana bhi us kaalikh ke prati thodaa sachet dikhaai di
 
 
 Then she quickly hurried towards us and sat on an empty chair lying next to me
 khadi rahati to use zyada hi gaur se dekha jaataa, vah teji se kamare main pehle se hi bichhe maahaul kaa hissaa ban janaa chaahati thi
 "I stayed your guests, thank you
" " keshavadas ne rachana se kaha
 ''thanks
 "ham sabhi hanse, dringrumavaali hansee
 Don't know if that was a satire or just what he used to think
 phir keshavadas aage chal padaa, amaru use purvawat bahut hi dhyaan se sun rahaa yaa
 i did not see any such feature in his talks
 rachana tab mujhe behad choti lagi
 i had never seen him shrink like this before
 har jagah vahi kendrabindu hoti thi, bich main deepashikha-si jalati hui
 
 
 ujli-ujli
 
 
 baaki sab dhundhlaaye hue
 The case here was the reverse
 
 
 kendrabindu vah dhamdhusar bana tha
 
 
 Almost ugly looking
 
 
 khoost
 Rachna's face was no longer black, but the color of her face was still floating in the sun
 ''main inhen is vibhaag ke afasaron kii tang sthiti bataa rahaa tha," keshavadas rachana kii taraf mukhaatib hokar bolaa, ''ab is vibhaag main shukla-jaise bhi hai- hoshiyaar, haalaanki bahut hoshiyaar nahin
 
 
 "she laughed, Amaru and Rachna also supported her
 apana naam sunakar main jaise jaagaa, ekaek hi kamare kii or baton se jod diya gaya tha, jaise dibbon ko joda jaataa he, jatke se, kuch takaraate hue
 i was so isolated until now
 
 
 amaru kii tarah uski baaten nahin suni thim
 
 
 Perhaps Mathuradas said this by getting angry with this
 
 
 isaki kya vajah ho sakati he, yah kisi or vakt kaa sawaal ban chukaa tha
 
 
 i was filled with tension, was going to say something but maybe he was ready and kept on speaking a lot more loudly, calling me 'shutup'
 meraa munh band kar vah phir apane prasang par utar aayaa tha
 According to him, it was enough for me at the moment
 uskaa nishaanaa sahi jagah baitha tha
 i had no special expectation from Rachna, but Amaru's attitude clearly came to me
 aakhir vah tha jo mujhe yahan laayaa tha
 
 
 And he jumped and turned to Keshavdas
 isiilie to afasaron ko bhandua kaum kehete hai
 i was feeling lonely, but even then going out was to carry insult
 sthiti utani saamaanya vaaki nahin thi jitani maine lene kii koshish kii thi kuch der pehle
 
 
 From somewhere she was also for the unusual Keshavdas as i had never seen her so excited
 vah behad hoshiyaar, dimagdar, smart or sabhi kuch dikhne kii joardaar koshish kiye ja rahaa tha
 i do not think that he would have abused me or anyone in his office
 sab kuch ek aurat kii maujuudagi se prabhavit dikh rahaa tha
 First his waiting presence and now his face
 
 
 yaa to keshavadas ko apane ekaant main khalal behad kharaab laga tha or vah aisi kisi or koshish ko aage aanevaale dinon ke liye band kar dena chahta tha
 
 
 Or he was making me feel his rival
 amaru or main donon main se mujh par hi yah role zyada acha or aasaani se thupata tha
 
 
 Because Amaru was a simple boy and looked like
 agar hamen keshavadas kii vahaan upasthiti se koi bhram hota tha to keshavadas ko mere aane par to or bhi zyada ho saktaa tha
 Keshavdas was talking loudly
 mujhe laga jaise vah apni umr ke faasale ko paatane kii koshish main pathar-par-pathar phenk rahaa he
 Generally he was not so talkative as he had difficulty in speaking a lot
 baat karte samay uskaa pet bhi hilta tha
 i found his action teen-like

 Despite the half-centuries of Jonathan Trott (52) and Ravi Bopara (60), England team 45 into the trap of South African spinners
 4 over main 171 ran par dher ho gayi to lagane lag gaya tha ki vah ab agar magar ke bhavar main funs jayega
 But the pitch at MA Chidambaram Stadium proved to be a haven for bowlers
 dakshin africa ne hashim amala (42) kii sadhi hui pari se acchhee shuruyaat kii or ek samay vah ekatarfa jeet kii taraf bad rahaa tha
 At this time, Brad took four wickets for 15 runs and Anderson took two wickets in lieu of 16 runs and tied South Africa for 165 runs

 However, for the first time in a match on the Indian soil, the bowlers were completely dominated by the bowlers

 Off-spinner Graeme Swann brought England the first success

 agle over main du plasis ran out ho gayi jabaki anderson kii swing leti gend ko jepi dumini puri tarah se chook gayi or bold hokar pavilion laute 
 Dale Steyn (20) and Morne Van Wyk (13) raised hopes by sharing a 33-run stand for the eighth wicket when Robin Peterson was out in trouble

 Two balls later, Pietersen also showed the way to the pavilion to explosive batsman Kevin Pietersen (2), who caught Jacques Kallis in the first slip
 petersan ne ian bel(5) ko out karke england kaa score teen wicket par 15 ran kar diya
 Bell failed to understand the flight and Peterson dived to his left and took a great catch

 Bopara, meanwhile, was also successful in scoring the only six of the innings

 After this, South African fast bowlers also showed their fire
 morkal ne mat praayar(10) ko out karne ke baad bopaara ko pagabaadha out kiya
 The batsman asked for a referral for this but it was clear from the replay that the ball was seen between the leg and middle stump

 Someone is needlessly called out of the ground, someone is told that you will have to agree
 aisa ghatiya bartaav nite rides main sirf bhartiya khilaadiyon ke saath hota he, jabaki videshi khilaadi puure mouj main rahete hai
 It is alleged that former cricketer Ajay Jadeja
 ajay jadeja ne kaha ki ise samajhane ke liye kisi blogar kii jarurat nahin
 It is for sure that the Indian staff along with the Indian players in the Knight Riders, in their own domestic cricket league, do a bad job of foreign staff
 main bhartiya khilaadi hum, main us team main bahut se khiladiyon ko jaanata hum
 a player was called out of the field, he asked why, then he got the answer, You Indian, do what i say
 bhartiya khilaadi vahaan kaise sahaj mahasoos karenge
 Indian and foreign players are divided there
 unki soch banty hui he
 i mean like Sourav Ganguly thinks differently so there is no doubt that the team is completely broken
 ajay jadeja kaa daawa he ki ye mahaj aarope nahin, balki sidhe un khilaadiyon kii jabaan se nikali hui baaten hai, jo is naslbhed kii tippaniyan jhel chuke hai
 According to Jadeja, these things have come to know only from the man inside the team
 vaise jadeja kii to baat ab saamne ai he, nite rides to is sijan main shuru se hi vivaadon main rahi he
 First removing Sourav Ganguly from captaincy, bringing foreign players to the maximum number, keeping the talk of foreign captain and coach John Buchanan up
 team main multiple captain theory kii vakaalat karnaa, nite rides shuru se hi isi tarah ke vivaadon main ulajhati rahi he

 a post shared by MONALISA (@aslimonalisa) on Nov 4, 2018 at 8:12pm PST The Family Court of Ahmedabad in Gujarat has rejected a person's plea in which he sought divorce from his wife on the grounds that he has a beard and his voice is like a man's
 nyaayadhish en em karowadiya ke samaksh yachika main vyakti ne daawa kiya ki mahila ke parivaar ne shaadi se pehle use dhokhaa diya kyonki use jaankaree nahin di gai ki mahila ke chehre par bal hai or uski aawaaj mardon kii tarah he
 The petition states that when they met before marriage, the woman was wearing neburka and she had not seen his face as it would be against tradition
 yachika ke jawaab main patni ne kaha ki hormone sambandhi kaarnon se uske chehre par kuch bal hai or unhen upachaar ke jariye hataaya ja saktaa he
 The wife alleged that her husband is giving the wrong reason for getting divorce because he wants to get her out of the house
 mahila kii vakil ne kaha ki talaak dene ke liye pati neadharahin aropalgaaye hai saath hi daawa kiya gaya ki sasuraal vaale unke muvakkil par dahej ke liye dabaav daal rahe hai or unke saath marpet bhi kii gai he
 After hearing the arguments of both the parties, the court rejected the appeal and said in its remarks that divorce cannot be granted for such reasons
 saath hi court ne kaha ki pati or unke vakil pichley kai sunwaayee ke dauraan court main apana paksh rakhane ke liye maujuud bhi nahin rahe hai

 (input bhashaa se) Following the announcement of Team India for the ICC Champions Trophy 2017, questions are being raised over the selection of some cricketers who have done well in the IPL
 vaise jab bhi kisi bade toornament ke liye team india chuni jaati he, to baad main aalochana hona aam baat he
 The players expected to be selected include Kolkata Knight Riders captain Gautam Gambhir, but this did not happen
 is par gambhir ke phans ne karaari pratikriya di, lekin gambhir ne team ke chayan se pehle hi khud ko is daud se baahar samaj liya tha
 KKR captain Gautam Gambhir, who was playing brilliantly in the IPL, also joined veterans like Sourav Ganguly for the Champions Trophy, but the selectors did not consider him worth it
 vaise gautam gambhir kii baton se bhi aisa lag rahaa he ki vah bhi khud ko kamatar samaj rahe the
 Gautam Gambhir, known for his open opinion, said about this, "by doing well in T20, you are only available for selection in T20 team
 ' Gambhir, stating the reason for not being selected in Team India, has said that it is not right to expect selection in one day tournament like Champions Trophy based on form in T20 tournament
 vaise gambhir kaa kahana bhi sahi he, kyonki donon formet main kaaphi antar he or gambhir pichley chaar saal se bharat ke liye vanade nahin khele hai
 According to media reports, Gambhir ignored his own chances of selection for the selection of Team India even before the meeting of the selectors and said, 'if you give players a chance in the ODI team by performing T20, then its Meaning that you do not value domestic ODI tournaments
 gambhir ne kaha ki agar main champions trophy ko dimag main rakhkar ipel main ran banaaun, to mujhe matlabi kaha janaa chahie
 ' gambhir ne yah bhi kaha ki vah ipel main apni team ko jitaane ke liye khelte hai, team india main jagah banane ke liye nahin
 According to him, if the players start doing this, then it will not be in the team's interest
 tippaniyan Gambhir, who has scored 425 runs in 12 matches of the IPL, said, "I play matches to win my team and not for selection in the Indian team
" ' However, Gautam Gambhir's performance in domestic ODI cricket has not been good
 vah vijay hajaare trophy ke 5 maichon main keval 133 ran banaae the
 Perhaps he was referring to this performance and he felt that his claim was weak
 ipel main shandaar khel dikhaa rahe keker ke captain gautam gambhir ko champions trophy ke liye saurav ganguli jaise diggajon kaa bhi saath mila, lekin chayankartaaon ne unhen iske laayak nahin samajha
 By the way, it seems from Gautam Gambhir's words that he was also thinking of himself as inferior
 khulkar raay rakhane ke liye mashhoor gautam gambhir ne is bare main poochne par kaha, 'tii-20 main acha pradarshan karne se aap keval tii-20 team main hi chayan ke liye uplabdh hote hai
 ' gambhir ne team india main nahin chune jane kaa kaaran bataate hue kaha he ki tii-20 toornament main form ke aadhaar par champions trophy jaise vanade toornament main chayan kii ummid rakhana sahi nahin he
 Well, Gambhir's statement is also correct, because there is a lot of difference in the two formats and Gambhir has not played ODI for India for the last four years
 media reports ke anusaar gambhir ne team india ke chayan ke liye chayankartaaon kii baithak se pehle hi khud ke chayan kii sambhaavnaaon ko darkinar kar diya or kaha, 'agar aap tii-20 ke pradarshan se vanade team main khilaadiyon ko mauka dete hai, to iskaa matlab he ki aap gharelu vanade toornament ko mahatv nahin dete hai
 Gambhir said that if i keep the Champions Trophy in mind and score runs in the IPL, then i should be called a meanie
 ' Gambhir also said that he plays to win his team in the IPL, not to make a place in Team India
 unke anusaar agar khilaadi aisa karne lage, to vah team hit main nahin hoga
 The comments ipel ke 12 maichon main 425 ran bana chuke gambhir ne kaha, 'main apni team kii jeet ke liye match kheltaa hum na ki bhartiya team main chayan ke liye
 ' vaise gharelu vanade cricket main gautam gambhir kaa pradarshan acha nahin rahaa he
 He had scored only 133 runs in 5 matches of the Vijay Hazare Trophy
 shaayad unka ishaara isi pradarshan kii ore tha or unhen lag rahaa tha ki unka daawa kamjor he

 This time Hina Khan has returned to mix poison in the life of Anurag and Prerna with strong planning
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki sho main anuraag or prerana kii shaadi ko rokane ke liye hina khan mistar bajaj ke saath haath milaayengi
 It is worth noting that in the show Kasauti Zindagi Ki 2, Mr
 Bajaj ie Karan Singh Grover has recently entered
 karan ke sho main lautne se darshakon main kasuti 2 ko lekar utsukata bad gai he
 Karan has won his acting in many hit serials before hitting the entry in films

 Professor Guy Standing, an economist at the University of London, calls the term precariat a new class
 unke mutabik, yah un logon ko paribhaashit karata he jinaki koi pahchaan nahin he or ve nimna aay par jivan vyateet karte hai; ve log jinka rojgaar anishchit he or asthir jivan ji rahe hai
 Guy believes that India's social policy should be upgraded and income should be promoted rather than subsidies
 ise 2019 ke chunaavon ke liye bade aarthik vichaar ke rup main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 In fact, two years ago, according to the proposal of the then Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subrahmanyan, the BJP has announced a plan to target farmers and give them money
 isaki kaat main congress ne sabhi nagarikon ke liye nunatam aay guarantee yojana kaa vaada kiya he
 Guy has been formulating the principle of promoting income since 1980

 *** tripal talaak ke mudde par siyasat garmati ja rahi he
 Before the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati has openly come out in support of Muslim organizations on the issue of triple talaq
 somvaar ko pradhanmantri ne mahoba main lagbhag saaf kar diya kitripal talaakkhatm hoga or muslim mahilaon ko is pratha se chhutkaaraa milegaa to mangalvaar ko mayawati ne apana muslim card khel diya
 Mayawati issued a press release saying that the issue of triple talaq should be left to the Muslims and their organizations
 saath hi mayawati ne ye bhi kaha ki tripal talaak ke bahaane rashtriya swayan sevak sangh (aresas) ko apana agenda thopanaa band kar dena chahie
 Mayawati said that this issue should be left on the society itself till Muslims form a general opinion and no one should impose it on them
 gauratlab he kipiem modine bundelkhand ke mahoba main pehali baar apni taraf se ye saaf kar diya ki ye pratha ab khatme kii kagaar par he
 Mayawati has political sayings on triple talaq, the election in UP is on the head and Mayawati's victory depends on the outright vote of Muslims
 samaajawaadee party main jis tarah ghamaasan machaa he use dekhte hue pradesh kaa musalmaan mayawati ke peeche khadaa ho saktaa he or mayawati ye mauka haath se jane nahin dena chaahatin
 However, it is now clear that the BJP will try to cash in on the issue of triple talaq before the elections, while the other parties will stand with the Muslim sentiments and their organizations regarding triple talaq being friendly to Muslims

 dilli kaa bhi yahi haal he, alag-alag samskritiyon ko apane bheetar samaae hue jiskaa har konaa kisi itihaas kii gavaahi detaa he, jisaki har patari ke kinare hariyaali bichhi he, jo har badalte mausam ke saath kapade or rang badalati he, lekin mahilaon kii suraksha kii chintaa yahaan agar mahamari kaa rup leti ja rahi he to saath hi ek or cheez he jise har koi mahasoos kar rahaa he-yahaan kii hawa main kuch aisa he jo anishtakaari he, jaharila he, jabardast tareeke se ganda or ghinauna he
 From the WHO organization to the University of Surrey and from the University of California at Berkeley to the iits of Delhi, Kanpur and Mumbai, experts from around the world have given the same conclusion in their surveys conducted during the last two years that this city is now the world Has become the most polluted city of duniya ke sarvaadhik pradooshit 25 shaharon main bharat ke 13 shahar shaamil hai or dilli is kukhyat suchi main awwal he
 PM2, the smallest and most dangerous substance among measurable particles
 5 ke prati ghan meter ke hisaab se dilli kaa ek nivasee ausatan 153 microgram kan apni saans ke saath bheetar le rahaa he, jo dablyuechao ke tay kiye salanaa ausat maanak kaa 15 guna he
 This fact may seem strange to ring the alarm bells, but the shadow of illnesses and death is already looming over the head
 yah kan sabase pehle kamajoro par asar karata he
 The smell of mist, burning of eyes, misty mornings and misty nights are just symptoms of a deep disease
 hawa main latake kan or sulfur dioxide ke bare main doctoron kaa kahana he ki isse mrityu dar badhati he, rugnataa badhati he or fefdon ke kaam karne kii kshamta par asar padataa he
 They say that these fine particles enter our breathing system and can cause changes in our immune system, damage the liver and kidneys and the brain of children, which can lower their IQ, lower their concentration
 And increases activity

 Two studies released in 2012 by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) show that one in five adults and one in four children living in Delhi had upper respiratory tract disease and this number shows an increasing trend
 is baat main ab koi do raay nahin rahi ki kaaphi tej karrwai kii jarurat he
 In these winters when the air quality is at its lowest level, suddenly some emergency measures are coming in and Delhi is going to be an example of some experiments in terms of pollution reforms which have long term consequences like Gwalior, Patna and Ahmedabad
 Will be very effective for cities that are more or less struggling with similar problems (see box)
 arvind kejariwal ke netritv vaali aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne is jang ko chhedgaye ke kuchhek aadhe-adhure lekin durust upaay sujhaaye hai
 The judiciary has added some weight to it
 dilli kii sarkaar chaahati he ki nijee chaarpahiyaa vaahan apane number plate par likhi sam-visham sankhya ke aadhaar par ek din chhodkar sadakon par nikalen
 On the other hand, the court has gone a step ahead and asked for the phasing out of all diesel driven vehicles from the road
 in donon yojanaon par machi cheekh-pukaar or vyavasthaagat dikkaton kii upeksha karte hue karypalika or nyaaypalika ne antat is samasya se ladgaye kaa faisla kar daalaa he
 The issue is fine, so there should be no problem in the debate, but the basic question is how much the problem is so severe, how it has become so vast, whether the measures being taken to fight it will be sufficient or the root of the problem elsewhere
 While trying to tie it to the wrong pegs? The first step to understand Delhi's pollution problem should probably be that we understand this city & this city means its importance
 To aspirations and its structure
 dilli buniyadi taur par kuch rihaaishon kaa ek network he yaa kah sakate hai ki gaanvon kaa ek sanjaal he jo aisi sadakon se aapas main jude hue hai jo aapas main ek-duusare ko katati hai, banty hui hai yaa paraspar gutthamguttha hai
 The city is a series of successive circles where all points of entry and exit exist, but neither is a central commercial site nor is there a clear residential pattern
 yah shahar jitna lanbaa he utana hi chaida he, mumbai se ekadam ulat, jo samudr ke kinare basii ek lambii rekha se dhire-dhire viksit hote hue alag-alag aakaar kii bhujaaon vaale ek trikon main simat gai he
 The population of Delhi is increasing dangerously and in the last two decades it has gone from one crore to two crores
 iske alaava iske ird-gird based nae shahar jaise gudgaanv or noida jinhen milakar rashtriya rajdhani kshetra kaa ise naam diya jaataa he, utane hi vyavsaayik hai jitne awasaiya hai
 It can be said that Delhi has a pot of smoke surrounded by the ground, whose outer area is covered with more smoke
 yahaan tatavarti shaharon kii tarah hawa ko saaf karne kii koi kudarti prakriya maujuud nahin he
 Apart from this, the problem is that the growth pattern of this city is so organized that it is very difficult to create a mass transport system that works for everyone because it is not clear where people live and work
 centre for science and envyranment (siesai) main shodh or edvocacy kii kaaryakari nideshak anumita raichoudhary jaisaa kahati hai, dilli “dizin kii gadabadi se grast he
 According to Rahul Mehrotra, an urban planner and professor of urban design and planning at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, the city is "a victim of poor land-use planning
" ” isi betaratib dhaanche kii dein he ki dilli kaa sabase bada madhyavargeey sapana apane paas ek nijee vaahan hona he, lihaaja yahaan kii parivahan pranali kaa sara jor nijee vaahanon ko badhaava dene par kendrit he
 You are successful in Delhi, the proof is that you have a personal vehicle of your own
 isi kaa parinaam hua he ki shahar main kul 88 lakh vaahan hai or har maheene isamen 1,400 kii khep judati jaati he
 This number is higher than the combined numbers of Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, although 65 per cent of this is two-wheeler
 ek anya dikkat yah he ki bharat ke duusare bade shaharon kii tarah dilli kaa vistaar itnaa teevr rahaa he ki yahaan kaa buniyadi dhaancha usase talmail nahin baitha sakaa he
 Mehrotra says, "the unique situation in India is that public transport operations remain in the back row
 ” yah duniya ke duusare bade shaharon se ekadam ulataa he jahaan saarvajanik parivahan or saste awasaiya avasaron ne nai or behatar tareeke se aapas main judi rihaaishon ko mumkin banaaya he
 Instead of leading urbanization, Delhi's public transport system has always accepted its backlog
 or isse samasya ghaneebhoot hoti jaati he
 For this reason, the use of public transport in Delhi is non-comfortable and they are less efficient than private vehicles
 yah dohari samasya hi ek ahm fark paidaa karti he, kyonki dilli ke adhiktar log jo saarvajanik parivahan par bharosa karte hai, unhen na to samay kaa laabh hota he or na hi unka tanaav kam ho paata he
 For example, if you go from Andheri to Churchgate train in Mumbai, it takes 45 minutes but it can take two hours by car
 isliye car bhale hi shandaar vikalp ho, lekin isse aapkaa samay kharaab hota he
 Conversely, take Delhi where it takes 50 minutes by car to go from South Delhi to Noida, it can take two hours by train, including the time to reach the station and from there to the destination
 yani dilli main saarvajanik parivahan na sirf kshtakaari he balki samay bhi khaataa he
 This is the basic reason that if someone in Delhi has the ability to buy a private vehicle, he does so instead of Mumbai or other better connected cities of the world, where the purpose of private vehicle is limited to family trips or weekly entertainment
 yahi vajah he ki 1 janvari se 15 janvari ke bich aam aadmi party kii sarkaar kaa praayogic rup se lagu kiya ja rahaa sam-visham vaala upaay shaayad naakaam ho jayega
 It is a good thing to give personal convenience to a problem like pollution, but trusting people that they will embrace an inefficient system in the name of "broad interest" is nothing more than goodwill
 isamen bhi kshamta kaa abhaav aade aa rahaa he-urban emishans ke sarat guttikunda ke anusaar sadak par paidaa hone vaale atirikt bhaar ko sanbhaalane ke liye 13,000 atirikt bason kii jarurat hogi, jabaki sarkaar ab tak sirf 6,000 bason kaa intjaam kar saki he
 Therefore, there is enough scope in this plan that it will create a new disturbance in the city
 vyapak sarokaar ke chakkar main iske parinaam vinaashak rup se ghaatak ho sakate hai kyonki iske anupyukt karyanvayan kii surat main niyam ko waapas liya janaa pradooshan ke khilaaf jang ko madad karne kii bajaae use nuksaan hi pahunchayegaa
 This will be no different from Sheila Dixit's ambitious bus rapid transit lane scheme implemented in the government which ended in demand for better bus service
 shaayad kejariwal sarkaar ko is par sochna pade
 Well, if it is implemented as an emergency measure with minimum concessions for a certain period, otherwise the even-odd formula is irrelevant because it is incompatible with the pollution problem
 guttikunda bataate hai ki vaahanon se hone vaala pradooshan teen buniyadi chizon par nirbhar karata he- sadak par chalane vaale vaahanon kii sankhya, har vaahan dwaara tay kii gai duuri or prayek se hone vaala utsarjan
 Due to the odd-even formula, 44 lakh of the 88 lakh vehicles disappeared from Delhi's roads, it is estimated that it will reduce emissions by 50 percent
 yah maamla haalanki saadhaaran ganit se aage kaa he
 The concessions the Delhi government has proposed if taken into consideration - such as the concession of two-wheelers, as the people driving it are a large part of the supporters of the Aam Aadmi Party, concession to women for safety reasons and ambulances and police including patients Concession of 25 lakhs and the vehicles will remain on the road, due to which the total number will be reduced to just 20 lakhs
 iske alaava yah bhi dhyaan dene vaali baat he ki jahaan kahin sam-visham vaala upaay lagu kiya gaya he-jaise mexico city or bogota main-vahaan har vaahan kii tay kii jane vaali duuri bad gai he kyonki phir ek hi vaahan parivaar ke sabhi sadasyon kii seva main kai chakkar lagaataa he
 That is, if the speed of a vehicle has increased by 25 percent, it will bring back emissions of 1
5 lakh vehicles on the roads
 iskaa matlab hua ki keval paanch lakh vaahan hi sadakon se dur rah paaenge
 There will be some short term benefits from this
