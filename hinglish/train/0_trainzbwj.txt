 chunaav main bijepi or narendra modi kii jeet ke baad vadodara main road sho kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 After the road show, Modi addressed the people
 padhein jeet ke baad kya bole narendra modi
 Long live Mother India
 aaj puraa hindustan jis nagari ke liye gaurav kar rahaa he
 My dear brothers and sisters of that Vadodara
 aaj subah se aap sab chaahate the ki main kuch boluun
 But my mind used to say that if i speak, i will go to Vadodara
 agar pehla haq he, to vadodara kaa he
 Good days are coming achche din aa rahe hai
 i have come here to greet you all
 dhanyavad karne ke liye
 As an individual candidate in this election, two important things happened to me
 ek, vadodara ko main mushkil se namakan bharne ke baad sirf 50 minute de paaya tha
 And you won me 5 lakh 70 votes
 main vadodara kii janata ko sir jhukaakar naman karata hum
 Here every single voter worked as Narendra Modi
 bhaaiyon bahanon
 i thank you all from the heart
 pranaam karata hum
 You played a huge responsibility
 duusari baat
 Perhaps for the first time in the history of India, no candidate has had the opportunity to communicate with his voters
 banaras ne modi ke maun par muhar laga di
 i did not get the privilege of speaking about me as a candidate in Benaras
 uske baavjood bhi modi ko maun ko banaras ke logon se jis prakaar se muhar lagaai he
 Both these events are important events in the political life of India, which are associated with me
 aaj aap logon ne nayaa record banaaya he
 Right now the media has not seen this thing
 hamaare desh main jo aam chunaav hote hai
 As it just happened main upachunaav kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 So do not let the media misquote me
 mujhe bataaya gaya ki hamaare desh main ab tak jitne loksabhaa ke general ellection hue hai, usamen paanch lakh 70 hajaar kaa record kisi ne kiya nahin he
 No promotion of a person
 kisi dal kaa prachaar nahin
 No Symbol Promotion
 lekin purna rup se loktantr, matadaata, matadhikaar or matdaan ek jimmedaar, in chaar maton ko lekar vadodara ke buddhijiviyon ne or samaaj ke har varg ke logon ne jo abhiyaan chalaaya, vah aaazaad desh ke itihaas main sabase badi ghatana he
 i congratulate you all
 (manch ke ek taraf vyavdhaan
 Modi sidesteps security personnel) Modi should be anywhere
 aapaki pareshaani use pataa chal jaati he
 In this election Gujarat has made a wonderful record
 26 main 26
 Earlier, people used to make fun of him
 main bataata hum
 Even 25 in 26 would have become evil tomorrow
 bhaajapa vaale jo daawa karte hai, sab farji he, aisa kaha jaataa
 i am grateful to the people of Gujarat
 unhone 26 main 26 siten deen
 Victory is not trivial
 lakh do lakh chaar lakh kii lead aasaan nahin
 i was told that about 60 percent of the voters voted in favor of BJP
 ye loktantr main ek nai misaal he
 The milkman comes, the housewife says, then pours some more milk
 sabji vaale se maango to kuch or sabji de detaa he
 Seven assembly elections were also held
 chah congress kii siten thim
 One belonged to BJP
 janata ne congress kii teen siten jitkar hamako de deen
 We won four seats in the by-election
 teen isliye rakh leen ki kahin unako takalif na ho jaae
 i do not know what the TV debate was today
 agar aa gai ho to abhinandan, nahin kiya ho to
 Brothers and sisters, after independence, most of the Congress party has been in government
 or jab bhi gaiyrcongress sarkaar ai he, to ek prakaar se gathbandhan kii ai
 This is the first time that a non-congress party has got majority on its own
 pehali baar ek rashtravaadi dal ko janata kaa is tarah se aashirwad mila he
 And one important thing
 ab tak desh main jitne chunaav hue, usamen netritv unke paas tha, jo aazaadee ke pehle paidaa hue
 This is the first election, led by those who were born after independence
 chaahe congress ho, chaahe bijepi ho
 This is a wonderful thing in itself
 main nahin jaanata ki is par political panditon kaa dhyaan kyon nahin gaya
 Today, i want to assure the countrymen from the land of Sayajirao Gaekwad that we did not get the privilege of dying of freedom
 hamen aazaadee ke liye jail jane kaa saubhaahgya nahin mila
 We did not get the privilege to bear the oppression of the British government in the war of independence
 lekin bhale hamen aazaadee paane ke liye jeene marane kaa avasar na mila ho, lekin aaazaad hindustan main surajya ke liye jeena, ye hamaara sankalp he
 We could not die for Swaraj
 lekin surajya ke liye ji sakate hai
 There is a manpower, by whose power India is going to be built
 meraa aap par bharosa he
 This is the power of trust
 jo bharat ke saamaanya nagarikon ko takat se las banaata he
 Today the NDA scored a triple century on its own
 endie ko teen sau plus de diya
 i am very grateful to the people of the country
 main prarambh se kahata aayaa hum
 Government is the country
 sarkaar kuch vishesh logon kii nahin hoti
 The government belongs to 125 crore countrymen
 main ek sawaal puuchhuun aapse
 Will understand parishram karne kii meri jo paraakaashtha he
 Does anyone in the country doubt him? ham to majdoor number van hai
 The country will not get laborers like me in the coming 60 months
 or maine chunaav abhiyaan main majdoor kaisaa hota he, ye udhaaharan prastut kar diya
 Four times you gave me responsibility as Chief Minister
 ek din bhi maine chuttee nahin lee he
 Because i believe that you have given me the responsibility
 isko puraa karne main sharir kaa prayek kan kharch ho jaae, to bhi kam he
 Our slogan in Gujarat was, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas
 janata ne hamen spasht bahumat diya
 Mandated a large number of ndas
 (vyavdhaan
 
 
 Gujarati demons modi bole
 gujarati-marathi all will come
 vadodara ne mujhe desh kaa bana diya
 Be patient )vijay kitni hi bhavy kyon na ho
 Why the flag is not flown at any height
 iske baad bhi bharat kaa samvidhan mujhe kahata he
 The same written by Babasaheb Ambedkar
 or ambedkar ko kisne prerit kiya padhane ke liye
 Gaikwad Saheb of Vadodara
 is dharti se baba sahab kii punyasmriti ko yaad karte hue main kahana chahta hum ki sabko saath lekar chaluungaa
 People used to ask what would Modi do if the majority did not come
 main unako kahata tha ki sarkaar chalaane ke liye desh kii janata hamen spasht janadesh dene vaali he
 And he gave it
 lekin maine usamen bhi kaha tha
 Despite the clear majority, we want to keep everyone together to run the country
 sarkaar chalaane ke liye bahut kuch mil chukaa he
 It is our responsibility to take everyone along to run the country
 ham is jimmedaari ko namratapurvak chalaane ke liye aapkaa aashirwad chaahate hai
 i congratulate the political parties who have won the assembly elections held along with these elections, the newly elected mlas
 mujhe vishwaas he ve desh nirmaan main hamaare saath aaenge
 i heartily congratulate all the politicians of all parties
 pratispardhaa apni jagah he
 The strength of democracy is that all are their own
 sava sau karod logon ke liye yah vyavastha he
 Let us go ahead with that
 agar vadodara kii baat karun to aapke pyaar ko vikaas ke rup main savaya karke lautaaungaa
 Once again i salute you for making a record in the history of India's 60-year general election
 raajnneetik kshetra ke un kaaryakartaaon ko bhi pranaam, jo 45 degree main bhi ghar-ghar gaye
 People used to say, there is no need to come
 kaaryakarta kehete the, nahin ye hamaara kaam he
 Heartfelt greetings of those lakhs of BJP workers
 main prachaar ke dauraan chote chote bacchon ke slogan dekhtaa tha
 One year old two two year old child
 abaki baar (bheed chillaati he modi sarkaar
 It was seen on youtube that even the children who have just learned to speak, this time Modi
 
 
 
 This means that after 15–16 years, when the elections will be held for him, his vote is also ready
 yahi loktantr kii takat he
 Generation should be passed on from generation to generation
 kaaravaan badhata chale
 Thank you very much once again

 After the arrest of social activist Anna Hazare, the scene which was seen on the streets of Delhi on Tuesday set a new example of 'gandhigiri'
 haathon main tirangaa or sir par gandhi topi pahane pradarshnakariyon ne na to koi koharaam machaaya or na hi rashtriya sampatti ko tanik nuksaan pahunchaaya vahiin duusari ore baba ramdev va unke samarthakon par laathiyaan barasaane vaali dilli police par bhi gandhigiri kaa prabhaav dikhaa
 Because not a single policeman had a stick nor a weapon
 darasal, anna hajaare ne pradarshnakariyon se khud apil kii thi ki vah andolan ke dauraan hinsa kaa rasta na apanaaen
 On the other hand, Delhi Police also gave strict instructions to their soldiers not to use force
 in apilon kaa asar bhi dikhaa or sambhavat: isiilie itani baari sankhya main hue virodh pradarshan ke baavjood kahin koi apriy ghatana nahin hui
 Before being detained, Anna Hazare gave his message to the countrymen in a new avatar
 pehle se ricard kiye gaye is sandesh ko apni giraftaar ke baad jari karwaakar anna ne kaha, "meri giraftaar ke baad is andolan ko mat rukne dijie
 This is the second freedom struggle
 puraa vishwa jaanata he ki bhrashtachar kis kadar apane paanv jamaa chukaa he

 Speaking to reporters, Gupta said, “we gave strict instructions not to use force
 badi sankhya main adhikari str ke karmchaariyon ko morche par lagaaya gaya tha
 Women police were also deployed in large numbers
 yahi vajah rahi ki kahin se bhi koi hinsak ghatana kii khabar nahin ai
 "the effect of this order of Delhi Police was that its jawans were seen unarmed on the streets and wherever it was necessary, they thought it appropriate to persuade the protesters instead of using force
 kai jagah to police ko pradarshnakariyon ko haathon se pakadakar le jate or samajhaate-bujhaate dekha gaya
 It is to be known that it was the same Delhi Police who lashed out at Yoga Ram Baba Ramdev and his supporters at the Ramlila ground in the middle of the night
 is dauraan dilli police ne bachche, buudhe kya mahilaon tak ko nahin bakhsha tha
 The woman named Rajbala, who was injured in this action, is still in the hospital and is fighting for life and death
 baharhaal, dilli kii sadakon par aaj jo gandhigiri dikhi usase do ashankaaye to jarur dur ho gai
 Firstly, demonstrations in the country can still be held in a non-violent and Gandhian manner and secondly, if the orders are not received from the top level, then even the police personnel will think a thousand times before using force

 php After the crushing defeat of BJP in the Karnataka Assembly elections, the target of the opposition is Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 ab saathi bhi unhen naseehat dene kaa mauka nahin chook rahe
 The Shiv Sena, an important ally of the NDA alliance, has targeted the Chief Minister of Gujarat on the pretext of this defeat
 shivasena ne kaha he ki modi ko hindutv kii jagah sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi par hamalaa karne kii ranneeti kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 In an article printed by Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana', party leader Sanjay Raut has said that Modi had marked Sonia and Rahul in their election campaign in Karnataka even though they should have focused on the Hindutva issue
 kya likhaa he 'saamana' menkarnataka main sidhe-sidhe hindu hiton kii raksha kii bhoomika honi chahie thi
 Narendra Modi went for campaigning in Karnataka
 vahaan sabha kii lekin sonia gandhi or rahul gadhi par tippanee karnaa hi unka pramukh mudda rahaa
 The public is no longer interested in commenting on Sonia and Rahul
 rahul gandhi ko akl nahin he or wo abhi kachche hai
 All these Modi speak again and again but it does not result in public
 modi vahaan par secular matlab dharmanirpeksh rahe
 If everyone has thought of staying secular, then who would think for the 80 crore Hindus of this country? Not the leader of Hindus, not the basis of Hindus
 aisa koi netaa nahin he jisko sachcha hinduvaadi netaa kaha ja saktaa he
 Strong Hinduist leaders also become secular as soon as the election comes and leave the issue of Hindutva to establish their foothold in national politics
 secular shabd ke naam par hinduon ko chalaa ja rahaa he or desh main raajnneeti kii ja rahi he or secular kaa tikaa laga kar bahut netaa gum rahe hai
 This is not the first time the Shiv Sena has targeted the BJP or its leaders on the pretext of the Karnataka results
 isse pehle shivasena supremeo uddhav thakare ne karnataka main bijepi sarkaar kii paraajay par khushi jataai thi use ‘marathi virdohi’ sarkaar qaraar diya tha
 Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray had said, "nobody expected the Congress to win in Karnataka, but i am personally happy because the BJP government, which had always done injustice to the people of the border areas, was ousted from power
" ’gauratlab he ki karnataka main marathi bhashi logon ke varchasv vaale simavarti kshetron kii sthiti ko lekar maharashtra or karnataka ke bich tanatani he
 Now it has to be seen that how much bjp's interest in this edict of Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut

 ’’ In a message sent to Swamy, Rahul Gandhi's office said, "your press conference has got our attention on the afternoon of 1 November
 aapke dwaara lagaae gaye aarope puri tarah galat, niraadhaar or manahanipurna he
 "it said," One can easily understand the reasons why your press conference has been called
 ’’ It said, "we are committed to take all legal action against the allegations made in your so-called press conference on scams
" aapako suchit karte hai ki aapke samvaadadaata sammelan ke makasad evam gairjimmedaarana vishaywastu ke khilaaf ham kanoonee karrwai karenge
 '' isamen kaha gaya, ‘‘aapke tathakthith samvaadadaata sammelan main ghotaalon ko lekar jo aarope lagaae gaye uske khilaaf sabhi kanoonee karrwai karne ko ham patibaddh hai

 gautam gambhir ek aise cricketer hai jinhen bebaak tareeke se apni baat kehane ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Recently in a conversation with ESPN Cricinfo, Gautam Gambhir explained why he feels that Yuvraj Singh will not be able to make a place in Team India in the near future
 gambhir ne selectors ke yuvaraj ko aaraam die jane par uthaae sawalgambhir ne kaha, ummid he ki coach, selector or captain ne yuvaraj se baatcheet kii ho or unhen sahi salaah di ho
 You can say whatever you want to the media but the player should give you the right opinion
 mujhe nahin lagata ki aaraam dena sahi shabd he, kyonki unhone cricket kaaphi dinon se nahin kheli he or vah khelnaa chaahate the
 If you want to see them in the World Cup, then they should be given more chances

 You cannot feed Yuvraj in a series while resting in a series
 sabhi chizon ko dekhte hue, yuvaraj kaa vaapasi karnaa kathin najar aa rahaa he
 Gambhir said, it seems quite difficult to expect Yuvraj Singh's return from here
 is samay team india main kuch behtareen yuva khilaadi apni daavedaari pesh kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, Yuvraj will need to do something different to make a place in the team

 Significantly, Gambhir has also been out of Team India for a long time
 unhone aakhri baar team india ke liye test match 2016 main khelaa tha
 Gambhir said, "you may have done well in the past, but now it is the past
" team main bane rahane ke liye aapako lagaataar acha pradarshan karnaa hoga
 Especially when players like Dinesh Karthik are ready to join the team
 unako jab bhi mauka mila he, unhone acha pradarshan kiya he

 uttar pradesh kii yogi adityanath sarkaar ne sangathit aparaadh par nakel kasne ke liye rajya main upicoca ke rup main sakht kanoon laane kaa faisla kiya he
 Under the proposed law, offenses such as underworld, extortion, land possession, prostitution, kidnapping, extortion, intimidation and trafficking are included
 yogi adityanath ne buudhvaar ko vidhansabha main upicoca (uttarapradesh control of argenised krime act) bill pesh kiya
 Uttar Pradesh is the second state after Maharashtra to implement such a strict law
 haalanki, pehle basapa supremeo mywati aisa kanoon laane kii koshish kar chuki hai, lekin unhen virodh ke baad baikfoot par janaa padaa tha
 Now the law being brought by the Yogi government has also been opposed
 rajya ke mukhya vipakshi dal samaajawaadee party samet duusare dalon ne yogi sarkaar kii manshaa par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 At the same time, organizations that are advocating Muslims are also seen standing against it
 kaha ja rahaa he ki ek khaas samudaay ko target karne ke liye is kade kanoon amal main laane kaa kadam uthaaya gaya
 What is the law against Muslims? Under UPCOCA (uttar Pradesh Control of Organized Crime Act) organized crime will be targeted
 is kanoon ke tahat giraftaar vyakti ko 6 maheene se pehle zamaanat nahin mili sakegi
 Police remand of the accused can be taken for 30 days, while under the rest of the law, only 15 days remand is available
 iske alaava apradhi ko paanch saal kii sajaa or adhiktam faansee kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan hoga
 The Yogi government, which came to power with the slogan of upholding the rule of law in UP, is calling UPCOCA the biggest weapon against crime
 lekin virdohi ise muslimon ko target karne vaala bataa rahe hai
 In fact, one such law was introduced in 2007 after the BSP government led by Mayawati
 isi dauraan azamgarh jaise duusare kuch ilaakon main aatankwaad se jude sandigdhon kii giraftaaryaan huin
 The effect of these arrests was that the law of the Mayawati government was strongly opposed
 us vakt samaajawaadee party vipaksh main thi or uski taraf se mayawati sarkaar ke kadam kaa purajor virodh kiya gaya
 There were allegations of arrests of innocent Muslim youth in the name of terrorism
 natijatan, mayawati ko kanoon waapas karnaa padaa
 Such apprehensions are also being raised about the current law
 basapa supremeo mayawati ne bhi is kanoon kaa virodh kiya he
 He has said that UPCOCA will be used for the suppression of Dalits, backward and minorities
 isliye vyapak janhit main upicoca ko waapas liya jaae
 Releasing platform, which works to protect innocent Muslims from the clutches of law in the name of terrorism, has termed the Yogi government's proposed law synonymous with communal politics and said that it will be used against Muslims
 mayawati ko kyon wapaslena padaa tha kanoonmayawati sarkaar ne jab ye kanoon waapas liya tab upi ke police mahanideshak vikram singh the
 Aajtak in se baatcheet main vikram singh ne bataaya ki us vakt is kanoon kaa durupyog dekha gaya, jiske baad use waapas lene kaa nirnay liya gaya
 Former DGP Vikram Singh, who spoke on UPCOCA, said on UPCOCA being brought by the Yogi government that a law already exists to end crime
 aise main upicoca laane kii aavashyata nahin thi, kyonki iskaa galat istemaal hone kii ashanka he
 They believe that such laws can be brought for terror and anti-national crimes, the rest of the land dispute or crime like extortion can be controlled only by the existing law
 haalanki, unhone ye bhi kaha ki maujuuda kanoon ke tahat senior police officer kii sanstuti ke baad hi cese darj kiye ja sakenge, jo ise sahi myanon main prabhavi rup se lagu karaane main ahm sabit hoga
 The draft of the proposed law also shows the possibility of misuse of the law
 nae kanoon main is baat ke liye bhi niyam banaae gaye hai ki uskaa galat istemaal na ho sake
 Rules have been framed for case registration and investigation, under which the Home Secretary will monitor such cases at the state level itself and the case will be registered only after the recommendation of IG rank officer at the level of the Board
 jila str par agar koi sangathit aparaadh karne vaala apradhi he to uski report kamishnar, jiladhikari denge jiske baad faisalaa kiya jayega ki aaropee ke kilaaf upicoca kanoon lage yaa nahin

 unhone mitu ke aaropee subhash kapur ko lekar apana riection diya
 Angad says prove it if he is accused
 pinkavila se baatcheet main angad bedi ne kaha- 'mujhe sachai ke bare main nahin pataa
 i used to go to the set and act like a professional and come home
 isi tarah meri job khatm hoti thi
 The first thing is that no one is going to comment on what someone does in personal life
 doosraa, aarope kisi par bhi lagaae ja sakate hai
 If many accuse me tomorrow, what will i do? Will it be investigated? Does this prove? There are a lot of questions in my mind about Meetoo
 ''ye ek great movement he
 It was a great voice, but it should have the end result
 mujhe lagata he ki # metoo main and rigelt nahin tha
 My point is that tomorrow you can spoil someone's image, what will that man do? Whether it is right or wrong, its loss is already done
 subhash kapur jaise vyakti ke liye
 i think he is a filmmaker for me
 film main mujhe cast kiya gaya tha, kyonki wo mujhe pasand karte hai
 I'm good, and I've done my job
 yah durbhagyapurna he ki wo is sab se guzar rahe hai
 i sympathize with them, really
 ''main unhen ek aise str par jaanata hum, jahaan maine unke saath kaam kiya or sab thik tha
 i believe that a man to man relationship is very different
 lekin set par women bhi thim or sab thik tha
 i think the movement needs more gravity
 aap ise sabit kariye tabhi wo vyakti doshi ho saktaa he
 Otherwise it can happen to any celeb
 'angad kehete hai- agar koi kuch galat karata he to aap turant exiaar karaie
 Why wait 7-8 years
 aap tabhi chot maarthe hai jab loha garm hota he
 If someone has done something, he should be punished properly

 The senior selection committee headed by Prasad has not selected India's World Champion Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni for the three-match T20 series against South Africa
 dhoni ko team main na chune jane par kai logon ne kaha ki chayankartaaon ne unhen team se baahar kar diya, lekin chayan samiti ke ek sadsy ne kaha he ki purv captain ne agle saal hone vaale tii-20 world cap ko lekar team chunane ke liye samiti ko samay diya he
 According to the selector, he will make a big decision, according to the selector, Dhoni has said that once he is convinced that the future of the team is in the right hands, then he will take decisions on his career
 chayan samiti ke ek sadsy ne kaha ki purv captain ko lekar aae din jis tarah kii baaten hoti rahati hai unako sunakar hairaani hoti he
 The selector said that Dhoni would never respond to such rumors
 unhone kaha, 'unako hataane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Rather they have given us time and have given the freedom to form a team keeping the T20 World Cup in mind
 unako pataa he ki team saamaajik vichaaron se pehle aati he
 He knows that if Rishabh Pant gets injured then we have no other option for him, so Dhoni decided to stay until the T20 World Cup
 is samay unhen hataane kaa koi sawaal nahin he
 He had taken a two-month break even before the Windies tour
 'dhoni ne di aazaadeechayankarta se jab poocha gaya ki world cap-2019 ke baad se dhoni se unki baat hui he kya? is par chayankarta ne kaha, 'nahin, hamen milanaa baaki he or bhavishya ke bare main baat karnaa baaki he
 So they have given us time to plan our strategy for the future and think about our options
 agar pant chotil ho jate hai to dhoni ke baad hamaare paas koi majboot vikalp nahin hai
 'this has once again raised the question whether Dhoni is necessary for the team as a batsman because he does not look like the type of batsman he used to be
 lekin chayankarta kaa maananaa kuch or he
 He said, 'is this what fans think? The team management clearly knows what they can do
 aaj bhi, ek finishar ke taur par hamaare paas unka vikalp nahin he
 Anyone who has played any international level knows how much pressure there is
 'kyon team india ke liye jaruri hai dhoni?chayankarta ne kaha, 'agar hamaare paas finishr hote to ham dhoni ko upar ballebaaji karne bhejte
 Even in the World Cup, we knew that his experience would be necessary in the end so that he can guide the tail batsmen
 aalochakon ne bhi is baat par sawaal kiye the ki semifinal main dhoni neeche kyon aae
 You have seen what they have achieved
 'unhone kaha, 'jab kisi ne 350 vanade or 98 tii-20 match khele hon un par tippanee karnaa behad aasaan he
 He has won as many matches in his career as no one may have seen in his life
 aaj ke takanic ke yug main kya aapako lagata he ki vipakshi team dhoni ke majboot or kamjor paksh par dhyaan nahin detii hon? eemaandaaree se hamen ek baat maan leni chahie ki agar pant chotil ho jate hai to hamaare paas dhoni kaa vikalp maujuud nahin he
 ' loksabhaa main sarkaar ne nagaland sarkaar kii ore se prastaavit inner line permit (ialpi) par jawaab diya he
 The government has said that the Center is currently considering the proposal of the state government
 tab tak is masale par kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 In fact, in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, BJP mps Sakshi Maharaj and Bhola Singh had asked - Is there an obligation of Inner Line Permit (ILP) in the north-eastern states, irrespective of the basic right to move freely in any part of the country
 
 kya sarkaar kaa vichaar nagaland ke dimapur main ialpi lagu karne kaa he
 He also asked the government that the government has a clear policy to bring a specific area under the ILP
 is par grih mantralay main rajya mantri ji kishan reddy ne jawaab diya
 He informed that the Inner Line Permit System is decided through the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations, 1873
 in praavdhaanon ke anusaar bhartiya nagarikon ko arunachal pradesh, mizoram or dimapur ko chhodkar nagaland main yatra ke liye inner line permit kii jarurat hoti he
 The proposal of the state government to implement the inner line permit for Dimapur is currently under discussion
 grih rajya mantri ne bataaya ki is masale par jab nirnay liya jayega, tabhi kuch kaha ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, Yeddyurappa has been very angry with organizing this rally in public and is preparing to take action against Eshwarappa as well as all the leaders and activists who attended this meeting

 Not only Eshwarappa, Santosh, who is responsible for the organization from the RSS, is also openly opposing Yeddyurappa's attitude and Yeddyurappa for giving his special people a position and identity in the party

 Sitting on the couch, Lodhi said, 'it costs 3 to 4 lakhs to get a center of your choice

 We give 2-3 lakh rupees, our work is done
 ’ is rakam kii chaatro se kaise bharpai kii jaati he
 Lodhi's answer to this question was - it is recovered from those, who are weak in studies
 pariksha paas karnaa chaahate hai
 It also depends on the situation at that time
 agar sab kuch makul ho to 10 se 15 chaatro ko is jariye aage badha diya jaataa he
 Lodhi admitted that so far many students have many tools available for open cheating during the exam

 After dealing with multiple channels asked yourself - So, your first reaction? a clear answer did not come from inside
 shaayad isliye chunki khabar apratyaashit nahin thi
 The gestures were clear for the last several days

 The color of the 'discipline Committee' was clear as to which decision had been prepared
 shaayad isiilie faisla aate hi kai pratikriya ek saath man main ghoomane lageen
 How would you feel if you were dragged out of your house (and then vying to know your reaction with the camera)? Just felt like something

 Former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha made a big attack on the Modi government's budget and said that it is like sharing money to get people's votes
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main sinha ne kaha, 'antarim bajet laayaa janaa tha
 But the government presented its sixth budget, taking away the Constitution
 unako janadesh keval 5 bajet tak ke liye mila tha lekin jaisaa ki ye har jagah karte hai, samvidhan kii paramparaon kaa dhyaan na rakhte hue inhone apana chatha bajet pesh kar diya
 Nobody is paying attention to that side
 log sirf yah baat kar rahe hai ki bajet acha he, bura he
 Sinha said, "the only effort of the government in this budget is to make cash available to people of different classes and take votes
" yani cash for vot inkaa mul mantra he
 Elections will be held in april-may, an item of expenditure that has been brought to farmers
 ise pehali disambar se lagu kiya ja rahaa he
 It has never happened before that expenditure should be implemented retroactively but this government is doing it
 march ke ant tak agar yah safal hua to yah sarkaar har kisaan ko 2 hajaar rupaya uplabdh kara degi or april-may main chunaav hoga, to yah chunaav cash for vot nahin to kya he?unhone aage kaha, 'centre sarkaar ne pehle aisa kabhi nahin kiya ki apane vot on acount vaale bajet main aisi baaten kii
 No one questioned that this government had no right to present the sixth budget
 vitt mantri khadey hote hai antarim bajet pesh karne ke liye lekin puraa bajet pesh kar dete hai
 They have abolished the 70-year-old traditions in their country
 'yashavanth sinha ne kaha ki agar ham is bajet ke vistaar main jaaen to paaenge ki kai aavanton kam karke rakhaa gaya he
 The allocation has been reduced in schemes like Green Revolution, White Revolution, Blue Revolution, Prime Minister Irrigation Yonja, Swachh Bharat Mission, Women Empowerment as compared to the previous budget
 iskaa arth yah hua ki realistic estimate nahin banaaya gaya he
 Sinha said that this government is trying to reduce expenditure and increase income by trying to fool the whole world
 kaha ja rahaa he ki rajkoshiya ghaataa 3
 2 percent will remain while this will not happen at all
 bajet ko gaur se dekhne ke baad pataa chalegaa ki vibhinn yojanaon ko kam paisa diya gaya he
 The government is preventing a lot of expenditure for the next year
 'unhone kaha ki krishi ke kshetra main bada sudhaar karnaa chahie tha lekin aisa nahin hua or bajet ko cash for vot kar diya
 There are many such things in the budget, which shows that the government is feeling that it will not come to the attention of the people
 kya ye bajet standing cameti main jayega, iske liye kisi ke paas vakt he?sarkaar ne shuukravaar ko lok chunaav se pehle pesh apane antarim bajet prastaavon main kisaanon, mazdooron or madhyam varg ko lubhaane kii kai badi ghoshnaaen kin
 Taxes have been exempted from giving cash of Rs 6,000 a year to small farmers, pension scheme for unorganized sector laborers and up to five lakh rupees for jobless people
 in teenon kshetron ke liye bajet main sava lakh karod rupye kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 About 25 crore people will benefit from this provision of the budget
 bataa den ki vitt mantri piyush goyal ne antarim bajet main kai lok lubhaavan ghoshnaaen kin
 He started the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana under which small farmers will get Rs 6,000 in annual cash in three installments
 sarkaar par is yojana se salanaa 75,000 karod rupye kaa vaarshik boj badhegaa
 This assistance will be provided to farmers with less than two hectares
 dilli main sattaruqam aadmi party(aap) ne guuruuvaar shaam ko kaha ki varisht netaa prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav ne rashtriya kaaryakarini se istipha de diya he, jabaki donon netaaon ne is baat kaa khandan kiya he
 Making the announcement, party spokesperson Ashish Khaitan said the two leaders were firm on the demand to remove Arvind Kejriwal from the post of party convenor
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki ve nijee taur par kuch, to saarvajanik taur par kuch or bolte hai
 AAP founding members Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav reacted immediately and denied the resignation
 yadav ne kejariwal se istipha patr pesh karne ke liye kaha
 He said that it is ridiculous that he and Bhushan are demanding the removal of Kejriwal from the post of National Convenor
 yadav ne kaha, 'maine ek haasyaaspad khabar suni he ki raajnneetik maamalon kii samiti (piesi) ne hamaara istipha manjuur kar liya
 Will my colleagues present my resignation letter? ”aam Aadmi Party has created a ruckus after being in power in Delhi last month
 kejariwal samarthakon ne bhushan or yadav par aarope lagaaya he ki ve mukhyamantri ko pad se hataane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 However, both the leaders have denied this
 donon netaaon ne 17 march ko diya tha istifah kejarivalam aadmi party ke netaa aurasanyojak arvind kejarivalke ghar hui party piesi kii baithak main yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan kaa istipha sweekaar kar liya gaya he
 The resignation of the two leaders has been accepted from the party's executive
 party netaa ashish khetaan kaa kahana he ki donon netaaon ne 17 march ko istipha diya tha
 After the meeting, party leader Kumar Vishwas said that all the terms and conditions of Prashant and Yogendra Yadav were approved, but only the national executive can take a decision on his insistence to remove Arvind Kejriwal
 kumaar vishwaas ne ise dukhad lekin satya bataaya he
 prashant-yogendra ji accepts all the conditions, but the decision to remove @ arvindkejriwal can be taken by the NC itself
 dukh:da lekin satya— Dr Kumar Vishvas (@drkumarvishwas)march 26, 2015vahiin party netaa ashutosh ne bhi twit kar kaha he ki baatcheet fail ho gai he
 Prashant and Yogendra's persistence to remove Kejriwal from the post of Convenor continued
 i hear funny news about the PAC accepting our resignation
 Will my colleagues please produce a copy of the resignation letter? - Yogendra Yadav (@aapyogendra) March 26, 2015 On the other hand Kejriwal faction has said that all the terms of Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan have been accepted, but Arvind Kejriwal has been appointed as National Convenor He is not ready to be removed from office
 Despite accepting all their demands they are insisting to remove AK
 In public they say AK is the leader, in pvt they insist on his removal
 — Manish Sisodia (@msisodia)march 26, 2015no effort to remove Arvind Kejriwal is accepted to me
 Let the NC decide on 28 March now
 — Manish Sisodia (@msisodia)march 26, 2015iske baad ye tay ho gaya he ki aam aadmi party kii 28 taarikh ko hone vaali rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main ab do masalon par pramukhataa se charchaa hogi, kya kejariwal rashtriya sanyojak pad se hataae jaaenge yaa yogendra or prashanth bhushan ko rashtriya kaaryakarini se baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya jayega

 The cricket world also honored him with the title of Tiger due to his achievements, but the family of Tiger, i
e
 Nawab Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, who gave Team India a new identity in the cricket world, kept his identity alive after his death
 For the cricket board has to fight
 videshi pichon par jab bhartiya cricket team ek jeet ko taras rahi thi tab tiger ne yah karnama karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The Test series between India and England is about to begin, and Tiger's wife Sharmila Tagore wants the board to officially name the series the Pataudi Trophy, playing its promise
 darasal bharat or england ke bich pichley paanch saal se ho rahi test siries ko isibi ne bhi pataudi trophy kaa naam de rakhaa he, lekin bisisiai kii is naam ko aadhikarik manjuuri ab bhi baaki he
 In this regard, Sharmila Tagore has written a letter to BCCI President n Srinivasan, in which he has demanded the official naming of the india-england series as Pataudi Trophy
 is babat unhone board se ek saal pehle hui baatcheet kaa hawala bhi diya he, or iske alaava khat main sharmila ne tiger pataudi ke naam par salanaa lacture shuru nahin hone par bhi naaraazgi jataai he
 The letter also mentions the prolonged legal dispute between the BCCI and Tiger Pataudi, as the matter has been stuck for a year
 khat ke mutabik board ke kai bade aadhikariyon se sharmila kii baat disambar, 2011 main hi ho chuki thi, lekin abhi tak baat aage nahin badi he
 The comments team india or australia ke bich hone vaali test series ko gavaskar-border trophy kaha jaataa he, or ise bisisiai kii manjuuri mili hui he
 This is an annual series, and for this once Team India goes on a tour of Australia, and next year the team of Australia visits India
 jabaki pataudi trophy ke saath aisa nahin he
 She is not played from year to year, so Sharmila Tagore wants to make it an annual series
 saal 2011 main kheli gai pataudi trophy main khud nawab pataudi ne aakhri baar hissaa liya tha, lekin iske kuch hi din baad mansoor ali khan pataudi ne aakhri saans lee
 Now his family is trying to keep Tiger's name always associated with cricket with the Pataudi Trophy
 bharat or england ke bich test siries shuru hone vaali he, or tiger kii patni sharmila tagore chaahati hai ki board apana vaayada nibhaate hue is siries ko aadhikarik taur par pataudi trophy kaa naam de
 In fact, the ECB has also named the Pataudi Trophy for the last five years Test series between India and England, but the bcci's official approval to this name still remains
 is babat sharmila tagore ne bisisiai adhyaksh en shrinivasana ko ek khat likhaa he, jisamen unhone bharat-england siries kaa aadhikarik namakaran pataudi trophy karne kii maang kii he
 In this regard, he has also referred to a conversation with the board about a year ago, and in the letter Sharmila has expressed displeasure even after the annual lecture in the name of Tiger Pataudi is not started
 khat main bisisiai or tiger pataudi ke bich chal rahe kanoonee vivaad ke lanbaa khinchne kaa bhi zikr he, kyon ki maamla ek saal se atka padaa he
 According to the letter, shame was talked to several big officials of the board in December 2011, but the matter has not progressed yet
 tippaniyan The Test series between Team India and Australia is called the gavaskar-border Trophy, and has got BCCI approval
 yah salanaa siries he, or iske liye ek baar team india australia ke daure par jaati he, or agle saal australia kii team hindustan ke daure par aati he
 This is not the case with the Pataudi Trophy
 vah saal-dar-saal nahin kheli jaati, isliye sharmila tagore ise salanaa siries bananaa chaahati hai
 Nawab Pataudi himself took part in the Pataudi Trophy played in 2011, but Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi breathed his last just a few days later
 ab unke parivaar kii koshish he ki pataudi trophy ke saath tiger kaa naam hameshaa cricket se judaa rahe

 Reversing the Congress' sarcasm of Rahul Gandhi being a leader of national stature and Narendra Modi as a state-level leader, the Gujarat Chief Minister on Monday said that Rahul is an 'international leader' and he can contest from Italy as well
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke videshi mul kaa hone ke mudde ko bhaajapa ke is kaddavar netaa ne apni 62veen varshganth par phir se hawa di he
 He made this remark during his one-month campaign for the Gujarat elections and said that he was proud to be a regional leader of the state
 agle loksabhaa chunaav main pradhanmantri pad ke liye modi ke naam par kadaa virodh jataa chuke bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bhi apane gujarat samakaksh ko badhai di or unke lambey jivan kii kaamana kii
 It is expected that a new phase of modi-nitish's tension may begin in the upcoming assembly elections
 modi ne rajkot main swami vivekananda yuva sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ‘haal main congress ke ek netaa ne yah bayaan diya he ki rahul gandhi ek rashtriya netaa he or main ek kshetreey netaa hum
 i am happy to be the leader of Gujarat but i do not agree with Rahul Gandhi as a national leader
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘mujhe gujarat kaa kshetreey netaa hone par garv he
 Rahul is not a national leader but an international leader
 vah bharat ke saath saath italy se bhi chunaav lard sakate hai
 In this statement of Modi, once again, Rahul's mother is of foreign origin, has been targeted
 congress pravaktaa raashid alvi ne pichley hafte yah bayaan is sawaal ke jawaab main diya tha ki kya gujarat kaa aagaamee chunaav ‘modi banaam rahul’ jang hogi
 Alvi had said that there cannot be a comparison as Rahul is the national leader of the Congress while Modi is the regional leader of Gujarat
 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne bhi ravivaar ko rahul ko ek rashtriya jabaki modi ko kshetreey netaa qaraar diya tha
 In Bihar, BJP celebrated Modi's birthday and a state minister from the party cut the cake in his office

 In this post, he told how (by becoming a ghost) one of his friends escaped from the clutches of two poor men who were molesting him on the deserted area of punjabi Bagh on 8 May
 'kareeb 5 minute se uskaa peechha kar rahe do darindon ne sunsaan jagah par achaanak uskaa haath pakad liya
 In such a situation, often someone is scared and shouts for help, but he did nothing of the sort
 usne to aisi acting kii ki jaise vah koi bhoot-pishaach ho or bhutaha aawaaj main bolne lagi
 During this time she would laugh loudly and then awkwardly look at the poor people who were molesting her
 ' khandelwal aage likhti hai ki wo isliye bhi khushkismat thi ki ghar se baahar jate samay usne apane bal nahin baandhe the, jiske kaaran uski bhoot kii acting or bhi nikhar gai
 The comments aakhirkaar khyaati kii dost kii acting safal rahi or unamem se ek gunda vahaan se bhaag khadaa hua
 Perhaps the other person was not afraid of this much, so his 17-year-old friend further increased his drama
 khyaati ne apane fasebuk post par likhaa, 'bina kuch soche, usne us vyakti kaa haath nonch liya or phir uske khun ko apane chehre par potte kar jor-jor se hansate hue or bhi khoonkhaar dikhne lagi

 aisi sthiti main aksar koi bhi dar jaataa he or madad ke liye chillane lagata he, lekin usne aisa kuch nahin kiya
 She acted as if she was a ghost-vampire and started speaking in a ghostly voice
 is dauraan vah bich-bich main jor-jor se hansatii or phir ajeeb tareeke se uske saath chhedchhad kar rahe darindon kii taraf dekhati
 'khandelwal further writes that she was also fortunate that she did not tie her hair while going out of the house, due to which her ghost's acting became even more sparkling

 The nine days of Navratri (navratri 2018) are the days of worship and worship of Mother Durga
 kai shraddhalunavaratrimein apane ghar par mangal ghatsthapana karte hai
 The unbroken flame burns
 nau dinon kaa upwas rakhte hai
 This time Navratri will start from 10 October
 aaie jaanate hai sharadiya navaratri 2018 ke mangalakalashasthapana kii vidhi or niyam
 Navratri festival begins with the establishment of kalash (ghata or Chota Matka) on the first date
 saath hi nau dinon tak jalane vaali akhand jyoti bhi jalaai jaati he
 Even if some rules are followed while doing the installation, it is more auspicious
 in niyamon kaa paalan karne se mata ati prasann hoti hai
 How to do Kalash Sthapana Vidhi in Navratri in Navratri If you are doing Kalash installation at home, first of all make a swastika on the Kalash
 phir kalash par mauli baandhen or usamen jal bharen
 Add whole betel nut, flower, perfume and panchratna and coin in the urn
 isamen akshat bhi daalen
 Kalash installation should always be done in auspicious time
 nity karm or snaan ke baad dhyaan karen
 After this, put a red and white cloth on a floor apart from the place of worship
 is par akshat se ashtadal banaakar is par jal se bharaa kalash sthapit karen
 Do not keep the mouth of the urn open, it should be covered with something
 agar kalash ko kisi dhakkan se dhakaa he to use chawlon se bhar den or uske bichon-bich ek nariyal bhi rakhen
 Put asparagus herbs, halkunds, lotus gattas and silver coins in this urn
 deep prajjwalit kar isht dev kaa dhyaan karen
 Then chant the Devi Mantra
 ab kalash ke saamne gehun va jau ko mitti ke paatr main ronpen
 Worship this tide as the form of mother
 antim din jware kaa visarjan karen
 Right direction of Kalash installation-1
 ishan kone (uttar-purv) devataaon kii disha mana gaya he
 In this direction, it is appropriate to install the idol and components of the mother
 2
 If you burn a monolithic flame in front of the mother idol, then place it in the fiery angle (east-south)
 puja karte samay munh purv yaa uttar disha main rakhen
 3
 ghat sthapana chandan kii lakdi par karen to shubh hota he
 There should not be any mess around the place of worship
 4
 Many people also change the flag in Navratri
 dhwaja kii sthapana ghar kii chat par vivy kone (uttar-pashchim) main karen
 5
 puja sthal ke saamne thodaa sthaan khulaa hona chahie, jahaan baithkar dhyaan va paath aadi kiya ja sake
 6
 ghat sthapana sthal ke aas-paas shauchalay yaa bathroom nahin hona chahie
 If there is a tendon above the place of worship, keep it clean
