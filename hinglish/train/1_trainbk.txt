 isi ko lekar unhone sabhi jail main ek saath chhapemari kaa aadesh diya he
 According to sources, jail manual is not being followed in most of the jails of Bihar and mobile phones and SIM cards are being used indiscriminately there
 bihar main pichley dinon jis tareeke se aparaadh main vruddhi hui he, uski ek badi vajah jail main baithe apradhi or vahaan se unke dwaara sanchalit ho rahi aparaadhik ghatnaayen hai or isi ko lekar sarkaar kii najar khaastaur par jail par he

 team india ke 'gabbar' yani shikhar dhawan kaa balla srilanka ke khilaaf pehle test main khub barasaa
 Due to which India defeated Sri Lanka in the gaol test and also avenged the defeat of 2 years ago
 pichley 4-5 maheenon main shikhar dhawan ab tak kii apni behtareen form main chal rahe hai
 Dhawan has dominated the three formats of the cricket since the Champions Trophy
 bilkul usee tarah jab team india ke purv visphotak openar virendra sahvaag kaa rahaa tha
 Be it Test cricket, ODI or T20 cricket, there is no difference in the way Shikhar Dhawan plays
 dhawan ke liye vaapasi kii raah nahin thi aasancampions trophy ke jariye team india main vaapasi karne vaale shikhar dhawan ke liye raah bilkul aasaan nahin thi
 Last year, Shikhar Dhawan was dropped from the Indian team due to poor form
 test cricket, vanade or tii20 main dhawan kii jagah ke el rahul or ajinkya rahane ne opening kii jimmedaari sanbhali
 The reason for Shikhar Dhawan being out of form was his strike rate
 team main apni jagah par uth rahe sawaalon kaa dabaav shikhar dhawan ke khel main bhi najar aane laga tha
 IPL and Champions Trophy turning point Shikhar Dhawan was dropped from the team due to poor performance in the home Test series against New Zealand last year
 lekin iske baad shikhar dhawan ne haar nahin maani or gharelu cricket or ipel sijan 10 main shandaar pradarshan kii badaulat bhartiya team main apni jagah banaai
 In the Champions Trophy, Shikhar Dhawan continued his previous tournament form and scored the highest number of 338 runs and won the Golden Bat award for the second time in a row
 iske baad westeindies daure par bhi dhawan ne shandaar pradarshan kiya
 After which he was selected in place of injured Murali Vijay in the Test team against Sri Lanka
 shikhar dhawan ne srilanka ke khilaaf pehle hi test main 190 ran thokar apane chayan ko sahi sabit kar diya
 Shikhar Dhawan's strike rate was also excellent during this period
 dhawan ne dilaai viru kii yaadagaal test main shikhar dhawan kaa jo andaaj dekhne ko mila usne team india ke purv visphotak openar virendra sahvaag kii yaad dilaa di
 Shikhar Dhawan completed his century in 110 balls and the subsequent 90 runs in only 58 balls
 isse unki teji kaa andaaj lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Dhawan's innings revealed that an explosive batsman like him is very important for the Indian team
 kyonki team india ko sahvaag ke sanyas ke baad hameshaa se aise hi ballebaaj kii kami khal rahi thi, jo shuruuaati overon main hi virdohi team ko match se bilkul baahar kar de
 Dhawan scored 126 runs in the second session of the first day of the gaol test
 jiske baad bhartiya ballebaajon dwaara kisi bhi seshan main sabase tej ran jodne ke maamle main vah duusare number par aa gaye
 However, he also missed Virender Sehwag's Indian record of scoring the highest 133 runs in a session against Sri Lanka in 2009
 khayr shikhar dhawan kii is pari ne srilanka ko yah chetavanee de di he ki aage aane vaale maichon main bhi unki mushkilen kam nahin hongi

 He was born in the southern Indian state of Kerala in the eighth century
 shankaracharya ke pita kii matyu unke bachapan main hi ho gai thi
 Since childhood, Shankaracharya had a tendency towards ascetic life
 lekin unke maa nahin chaahati thim ki wo sanyasi jivan apanaaen
 It is said that Shankaracharya, at the age of 8, went for a bath in the river with his mother Shivtaraka
 vahaan unhen magaramchh ne pakad liya
 After which Shankaracharya told his mother to allow him to become a sannyasin or else this crocodile would kill him
 jiske baad unki maa ne unhen sanyasi banane kii anumati de di
 Shankaracharya died at the age of 32 in Kedarnath, Uttarakhand
 lekin isse pehle unhone hindu dharm se judi kai ruudhivaadee vichaardhaaraon se lekar buddha or jain darshan ko lekar kai charchaa kii hai

 Even after the announcement of the Lok Sabha elections, even though the vehicles of the leaders started running from the wide streets of the city to the broken roads of the village with a fret, the date of the election has increased the trouble of those who fixed the dates of the marriage during that time
 Have done ab aise log apni tay tithiyaan badalane lage hai
 Astrologers say that there are many auspicious times of marriage in April and May this year
 pandit jai kumaar pathak bataate hai ki mahavir panchang ke mutabik april maheene main 11 din or may maheene main 21 din vivaah ke liye ati shubh muhoort hai, jabaki mithila panchang ke mutabik april main saat din or may maheene main 14 din vivaah ke liye shubh muhoort hai
 Ramnivas of Patna, who has decided to marry his son, says that the biggest problem during the elections will be vehicles
 maalik vaahan kii muhmangi keemat maangenge, yahi nahin vaahanon ko le jane ke liye pramaan patr kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 He says that there will be more trouble for Tilak, if you are taking money and if caught then you will also have to give proof of that
 idhar, chunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone ke baad aise log bhi pareshaan hai, jinhen vivaah main band baaja se lekar laudspikar, hathi, oont or ghode kaa upyog karnaa he
 It is said that for such marriages the law of election code of conduct does not apply but loudspeaker, bandbaja, elephant, horse falls under the purview of the code of conduct, therefore, permission has to be obtained before its use
 gauratlab he ki bihar main matdaan 10 april se 12 may ke bich hona he
 Due to the election, people will have trouble in moving relatives
 sabase zyada pareshaani 17 april, 23 april, or 12 may ke shubh muhoort ke din hone vaale vivaah karne vaale logon ko hogi
 There are seven Lok Sabha elections in Bihar on 17 April and six Lok Sabha constituencies on 12 May
 vaise 23 april ko matdaan nahin he, lekin 24 april ko matdaan he
 Here, for community hall owners and hoteliers too, the auspicious time for marriage and the election date has become a cause of trouble
 patna ke belerode sthit jalataa community haul ke rakesh kumaar kehete hai ki april or may kii shaadiyon ke liye 15 booking hai, lekin chunaav tithi kii ghoshnaa ke baad log aakar ab isamen badlaav karne lage hai
 Here, Patna's Sadar subdivisional officer Mohammad Nayyar Iqbal says that the code of conduct on marriage does not apply, but the use of the band Baja and loudspeaker will have to take orders from the administration three days in advance
 vaise vaahan maalikon ne vivaah ke is mausam main vaahanon ko lekar prashasan se milane kaa man banaaya he
 Uday Shankar Singh, president of Bihar Motor Transport Federation, says that the Election Commission and Transport Department secretary will meet and request to leave 10 to 15 percent of the vehicles according to the number of vehicles in the district
 vah kehete hai ki vaahanon kii koi kami nahin he, sirf inhen vyavasthit karne kii jarurat he
 The Election Commission has ordered registration of an FIR against a news channel showing the interview of Congress President Rahul Gandhi

 chunaav ayog ne rahul gandhi ke intervyuu ko dikhaane par bhi tatkaal roak laga di he
 Apart from this, the Election Commission has also summoned the reply by sending notice to Congress President Rahul Gandhi

 The Election Commission asked Rahul why action should not be taken against you for violating the code of conduct? If Rahul Gandhi does not give his reply by 18 December, the commission can take action against him
 darasal, aaj hi ekagujarati channel main rahul gandhi kaa exclusive intervyudikhaya gaya tha, jisamen rahul ne gujarat sarkaar or modi sarkaar jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Rahul asked PM Modi many questions through interviews and he claimed that the Congress government is going to be formed in Gujarat
 duusare charan kii voting se thik ek din pehle rahul ke ye intervyuu ko lekar bijepi ne sawaal khadey kar die
 According to the BJP, the channel has directly violated the Election Code of Conduct and complained about the matter to the Election Commission, after which the Commission has ordered initial action on the channel and registering an FIR

 intervyuu main rahul ne kaha ki gujarat kaa chunaav ek tarafa hone vaala he
 He said, "congress leaders had forbidden me to do more campaigns in Gujarat, but i have interest in work and not in results
 gitaji main likhaa he- kaam karo fal kii chintaa mat karo
 i obey the same
 ''rahul ne kaha ki congress party ek puraani vichaardhaara vaali party he
 The BJP has no vision in Gujarat
 modi ne gujarat kii janata ke saamne koi vijan nahin rakh sake hai
 Modi either kept talking or kept talking about the Congress but he did not say anything for Gujarat

 Input: IANS gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko america vija nahin dene ke liye raashtrapati baraak obama ko bhartiya saansadon ke patr ko lekar paidaa vivaad ne us samay nayaa mode le liya jab california ke ‘forencik document ekjaminner’ vibhaag ne kaha ki saansadon ke hastakshar ‘vaastavik or pramanik’ hai
 After the forensic examination of the letter, the report said that the documents were prepared at one time and have genuine, authentic signature of wet ink
 loksabhaa sadasyon ke patr main bhi isi tarah kaa nishkarsh paaya gaya
 Letters to Obama were written by members of the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha on November 26 and December 5 respectively and these letters were faxed again on July 21 to the White House
 california ke ‘forencik dacument ekjaminner’ ke nanet em barto ne in patron ke lekhan kii forencik jaanch kii
 The investigation was carried out at the request of the Collision Against Genocide (CAG), a campaign against Modi, after some mps refused to sign a letter written to Obama by CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, CPI MP Achuthan and DMK KP Ramalingam
 chalis bhartiya america sanghathanon kaa samooh sieji modi ko america vija ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaa rahaa he
 Asked for feedback on the forensic investigation report, Achuthan said that he does not remember signing any such memorandum
 unhone kaha ki unhen sirf itnaa yaad he ki unhone bharat ke vibhinn bhaagon khaskar uttari rajyon main muslimon yuvakon ko aatankwaadi bataakar hiraasat main lene par naaraazgi jataate hue ek patr par hastakshar kiye the
 Ramalingam said that it was a matter of privilege that should be sent to Chairman Hamid Ansari
 unhone kaha, ‘main pehle hi kah chukaa hum ki maine patr par hastakshar nahin kiye hai
 Yechury is on a tour of North Korea with a parliamentary delegation, so his remarks could not be taken
 yechuri ne kaha tha ki unhone patr par hastakshar nahin kiye hai or dastavej par unke kathith hastakshar ‘cat and paste job’ he
 Raja Swamy of the CAG claimed that forensic investigations prove that the documents are authentic
 forencik jaanch main sabit hua he ki kaagaj vaali prati yaa electronic praaroop main se kisi bhi dastavej main hastakshar ek jagah se uthaakar duusari jagah chipkaane jaisaa kuch nahin hua he or donon dastavejon main hastakshar alag alag hai
 CAG spokesperson Swamy said that since some Members of Parliament questioned the credibility of these letters, either not signing or missing the signature, the CAG asked professional forensic examiners to verify the credibility of both letters
 Decided to include
 pakistan ke peshawar main ek bazaar main hue jabardast dhamaake main kam se kam 21 logon ke maare jane kii khabar he jabaki kai anya log ghayal ho gaye

 It is also concerned with the continued deterioration of Pakistan's institutions, its internal security and economy
 nitigat maamalon main pakistan pareshaani kaa sabab ban gaya he
 America does not understand that it should maintain its current position, or change its policies to suit the realities of staying with the government and military establishment
 darasal, pakistan sarkaar or faujee pratishthan donon hi america uddeshyon kaa samarthan or virodh ek saath karte hai
 Americans have been fed up in dilemma and have missed their endurance
 21 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india tudamerica ko aatank ke lagaataar khatre se bhi nipatna he
 In the new year, this danger is unlikely to decrease

 The US and Iran have been in conflict for the last 30 years
 america ko is takaraav ke nateezon se bhi nipatna he
 The danger is that arithmetic or wrong decisions of Iran's clerics and American leaders could lead to a fierce war, which would have fatal consequences for the region and the world
 un muddon kaa koi samaadhaan nahin dikh rahaa he jinase in donon ke bich takaraav ko taalane main madad mili
 On the other hand, Israeli leaders are trying to provoke America

 Terrorist organizations like Lashkar and Hizbul Mujahideen in the post-demonetisation Kashmir valley are fond of pie-pie
 grih mantralay kii ore se rajyasabha main die likhit jawaab se yah baat saamne ai he
 It has been said by the Ministry that the militants in the Kashmir Valley have a huge shortage of cash, due to which the terrorists are carrying out the incidents of bank robbery in Jammu and Kashmir
 grih mantralay ne apane likhit jawaab main kaha he, ki pichley saal july 2016 se 15 july 2017 tak jammu kashmir main bank lut ke 9 maamle saamne aae hai or inamen se 5 banketim chori ke maamlebhi suchit kiye gaye hai
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has informed in its report that one crore 17 lakh 61 thousand 550 rupees were looted out of which one lakh 99 thousand rupees have been recovered by the security forces in different operations
 grih mantralay se mili jaankaree ke mutabik is puri lut ke cond main suraksha agenciyon ne 10 vyaktiyon ko giraftaar kiya he jabaki aatanki muthbhed ke dauraan do aatanki maare gaye hai
 Banking terrorist organizations from demonetisation Since the announcement of demonetisation on November 8 last year, there have been many incidents of bank robbery in the Valley
 isse sanket miltaa he ki aatankwaadiyon ke paas nakad kii kami ho rahi he
 Due to strict rules being implemented by the central government, money transactions through hawala have also stopped
 iske kaaran aatankwaadi sanghathanon kii funding or unke vittiya sansadhano par kaaphi asar padaa he or unke saamne paison kii killat paidaa ho rahi he
 These terrorist organizations need money to buy many motives behind the bank robbery and give to their terrorists
 aise main ab aatankiyon ne bank lootakar paisa hasil karne kii nai ranneeti apanaai he
 By robbing the bank, these terrorists not only get lump sums, but since the banks are also associated with the image of the government and the administration, in such a situation, the terrorists find it easier to rob them and also indulge the government
 kashmiriyon kii banking system se kaatane kii koshish!kendriya suraksha agenciyon ko lagata he ki bainkon par lagaataar ho rahe aatanki hamale dohari talwaar sabit ho sakate hai
 Sources said that ever since demonetisation came into force, most people of the valley have started depositing their money in banks
 aatanki in bainkon par hamalaa karke logon ke man main ek kism kii asuraksha or dar baithaana chaahate hai
 Perhaps the purpose of terrorists is to frighten people, so that they keep the money with them instead of depositing in banks as before
 logon ke paas paisa rahane se aatankiyon ko paise milane main sahuuliyat rahati he
 According to information received from the sources of most bank robbery security agencies in South Kashmir, the position of terrorists in the 4 districts of South Kashmir- Pulwama, Anantnag, Shopian and Kulgam is stronger than the rest of the areas
 in chaaron jilon main aatankiyon ko bahut had tak janata kaa bhi samarthan miltaa he
 The maximum incidents of bank robbery and snatching of weapons from policemen have taken place in these four districts

 Nine bogies of the New Farakka Express derailed in Uttar Pradesh's Raebareli on Tuesday morning
 haadase main kul 6 logon ko maut ho gai he
 However, whether this is an accident or a conspiracy behind it, questions are being raised
 kyonki haadase ke turant baadauttar pradeshki aties (anti-terrorism Squad) team maukey par jaanch ke liye pahunch rahi he
 This is the reason why questions like conspiracy are coming up after the incident
 darasal, jis jagah ye haadasa hua he vahaan par patariyaan tuuti hui dikhaai de rahi hai
 Because of which the accident became so big
 ab upi aties inhen pahaluon ko tatolane maukey par pahunch rahi he
 However, the police officers present there are still refraining from making such a statement
 unka kahana he ki pratham drushtya main ye haadase kaa hi maamla lag rahaa he
 Let me tell you that this is not the first time that a conspiracy has been suspected in a railway accident in Uttar Pradesh
 isse pehle pichley saal hue mujffarnagar rail haadase main bhi aties jaanch ke liye pahunchi thi
 The ATS was then searching for a Terror Angle in the accident
 haalanki, jaanch main kuch nahin niklaa tha
 Not only UP but last year, the terrorists in Bihar had put the IED on the track, due to which the suspicion of ATS was deepened

 film nirdeshak mehboob khan kaa janm 9 sitambar, 1907 ko gujarat ke billimoda shahar main hua tha
 Through his amazing art, he introduced Indian cinema to abroad
 madar india film ko bhala koun bhul saktaa he
 The film went on to reach the Oscars
 film aword lene main to asafal rahi magar film ne bhartiya cinema ko nai disha jarur dikhaai
 Mehboob Khan died on 28 May 1964 at the age of 56

 Film director Mehboob Khan directed a total of 24 films in a 30-year career

 Apart from this, he made excellent films like Watan, Aurat, Bahen, Takdir, Anmol Ghari, Andaz, Aan and Amar
 unki filmon main mahilaon ke sammaan ke prati khaas jhukaav hota tha
 Very few people would know that Mehboob Khan was fond of becoming an actor, not a director
 16 saal kii umr main ve ghar se bhagkar acting karne ke liye mumbai aa gaye the
 But when his father came to know about this, he brought Mehboob back home
 magar actor banane kaa sapana unke man main abhi bhi tha
 Time passed by
 jab mehboob 23 saal ke hue to film industry ke ek jaankaar sang mumbai aa gaye or tabele main ghodon kii naal thonkane kaa kaam karne lage

 mehboob ne saath kaam karne kii ichha jataai jis par unhen diarector kii rajamandi bhi mil gai
 But the roll got very small
 iske baad dhire-dheer unhen saporting rolls hi mili
 This is the period when silent films used to run in the industry
 bahut kam log hi ye jaanate honge ki jab bharat main pehali bolti film alam aara ban rahi thi to uske lead role ke liye film ke nirdeshak ardeshir irani ne mehboob khan ko hi pehle cast kiya tha
 But the matter did not become special
 tamaam logon ne ardeshir ko kaha ki pehali film he, isamen zyada experiment karnaa thik nahin he
 After this, the role actor Vitthal played in the film

 And a few months later Nazir was admitted to the Indian Army

 Despite all the controversies, Sania and Shoaib have taken such a decision and that is why this couple does not miss any opportunity to have fun amidst all the troubles
 duniya unke rishte ke bare main kya kahati he is baat se bephikr sania auki shoeb sukun ke do pal nikaalane kaa koi mauka nahin chhodte
 Sania and Shoaib got out of the fun on Monday night as soon as the excitement subsided
 marcides kii agali seat par kajan auki pichhali seat par maujuud the khud sania or shoeb
 Sania and Shoaib went out on the streets of Hyderabad to enjoy ice cream, avoiding the eyes of the media from the media

 It is clear that Shoaib may be troubled by the relationship with Ayesha

 On Monday, when Sania and Shoaib came in front of the media, they tried to give the same message with their gestures

 -input IANS We have always heard that blood pressure rises during anger
 aise main behosh hone kii ashanka bhi hoti he
 But if your blood pressure decreases in anger or stress then there is a need to be more vigilant
 vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki 10 main se do log aise hote hai, jinka tanaav yaa gusse ke vakt raktchaap kam ho jaataa he
 In such a situation, paralysis may attack and even death
 california vishvavidhyalay ke ek shodh ke mutabik vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki gusse ke dauraan aamtaur par logon kaa raktchaap bad jaataa he
 But some people also have lower blood pressure
 jin logon kaa raktchaap kam hota he, unamem lakva hone kii ashanka zyada hoti hai
 Team chief scientist Stephen Clarke says that when you try to control your mind in anger and stress, your blood pressure starts to decrease
 kai baar yah itnaa zyada kam ho jaataa he ki aapako lakva ho jaataa he
 If a paralytic attack is severe, a person may go into a coma and may even die
 doctor mukesh gupta kehete hai, kisi ko lakva tabhi hota he, jab uske sharir main rakt kaa sanchaar bahut kam ho jaae
 Blood pressure is low during stress and if this condition persists for a long time, then there is an increased risk of paralysis
 vah kehete hai, raktchaap kam hone par hamaare sharir kaa tantrika tantra thik se kaam nahin kar paata
 If this condition persists for too long, the nerve cells become dead and paralyzed in the associated organ
 doctor dipankar gupta kehete hai, jinka raktchaap kam rahata he, unhen hameshaa apane paas namak vaala munakka rakhana chahie
 This is the easiest way to normalize blood pressure
 sookhaa namak khaane se raktchaap saamaanya hota he, magar isamen thodaa vakt lagata he
 While rashes have immediate effect
 vah kehete hai, raktchaap zyada hona sehat ke liye kharatnaak he, lekin kam hona zyada khatarnaak hota he
 Fainting if the blood pressure is low, body stiffness are very common problems
 agar kisi kaa raktchaap kam rahata he, to use apni sehat kaa puraa khyaal rakhana chahie

 Aamin writes "I told him that people here consider me a street-imprint but i want an opportunity so that i can roam the world and learn something new
" " phir kya tha, aamin ne duniya dekhi, khub ghumaa or mumbai ke liye uskaa pyaar badhata hi chalaa gaya

 But some channels say that they are following the rules and will go to court against this arbitrary decision
