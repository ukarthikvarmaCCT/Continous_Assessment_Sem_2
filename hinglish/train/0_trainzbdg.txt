 Surjit Singh is coming to India in place of Sarabjit Singh
 haalanki pehle khabar ai thi sarbajit singh kii rihaai kii
 But the Pak government later announced Surjeet's release
 surajeet singh bhi bharat ke wo saput hai jinhen paak jail main varshon yatnaa sahani padi
 Harbans Kaur is the wife of Surjit Singh, another Indian jailed in Pak jail
 punjab ke ferozepur ke ek gaanv main surajeet ke gharavaale tees saal se takataki lagaae baithe hai
 Wife Harvans Kaur's eyes were pelted as if waiting
 harbans cor kaa varshon kaa intjaar ab khatm hi hone vaala he
 Because now the government has announced the release of Surjit Singh, not Sarabjit Singh
 sarbajit par pakistan ke you turn ke baad yahi sawaal uth rahe hai
 Pakistan President's spokesman Farhatullah Babar has clearly said that Sarabjit Singh, who is lodged in Kot Lakhpat Jail, Lahore, neither has to be released nor his sentence has been reduced
 jis shaks kii rihaai honi he, unka naam surajeet singh he
 The Pakistani President's spokesman made it clear that Surjit Singh has completed his life sentence and will be released
 surajeet singh ko 1982 main bharat pakistan seemaa ke kareeb jasusi ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 At that time, General Zia ul Haq was in power in Pakistan
 surajeet par mukadmaa chalaa or unhen maut kii sajaa sunai gai
 In 1989, Surjit Singh was pardoned by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan on the advice of the then Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
 sitambar 2004 main jail main 25 saal bitaa lene ke baad bhi surajeet singh ko reeha nahin kiya gaya tha
 Watch the game of Muqaddar, Surjit Singh was also lodged in the same Lakhpat Jail in Lahore where innocent Sarabjit Singh is lodged after being sentenced to death for the bomb blast and both are residents of Punjab
 sarbajit kii tarah surajeet ne bhi badi qurbaani di he
 Spent precious 30 years of his life in Pakistani prison under torture
 lihaaja surajeet kii rihaai kii ahmiyat bhi kam nahin

 chidambaram ne kaha he ki pakistan ko yah baat sweekaar kerani chahie ki giraftaar aatankwaadi jabiuddin ansaari urf abu jindal kaa 2008 ke mumbai hamale main haath tha
 Chidambaram told reporters on Friday, 'pakistan should accept that Jindal had gone to Pakistan
 vah us samooh kaa hissaa tha, jisane sajeesh rachi or (ajmal) kasaab va anya nau (hamale main shaamil aatankwaadiyon) ko prashikshan diya
 Jindal was one of the architects and leaders of the Mumbai attack
 'chidambaram pakistan ke aantarik mantri rahamaan malik kii us tippanee par puche gaye sawaal kaa jawaab de rahe the, jisamen malik ne kaha tha ki 26 / 11 hamale kaa sutaradhar jindal ek bhartiya naagarik he, lihaaja uski karatuuton ke liye pakistan ko jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Chidambaram said, "I agree with Rahman Malik that Abu Jindal is an Indian citizen, but he was given shelter in Pakistan
" pakistan ko yah sachai bhi sweekaar kerani chahie ki usne jindal ko passport muhaiyaa karaayaa tha
 Two identity cards have been found from Jindal
 'ullekhneey he ki saudi arab dwaara pratyrpit kiye jane ke baad jindal 21 june ko nai dilli pahunchaa
 He was arrested at the airport
 us par 10 pakistani aatankwaadiyon dwaara 26 / 11 ke hamale ko anjaam dilaane main kathith rup se bhoomika nibhaane kaa aarope he
 During the attack, the only terrorist Ajmal Kasab was arrested alive
 vah is samay mumbai kii ek jail main he
 166 people including foreign nationals were killed in this terrible terrorist attack in November 2008
 baat 31 july, 2013 kii raat 11 baje kii he
 Hours ago, the National Spot Exchange (NSEL) decided to stop trading in all its one-day forward contracts for the time being
 raat ke is pahar kareeb 80 brokers ne mumbai ke apat tower par dhaava bol diya tha, jahaan financial technologies (apat) kaa offis he
 He wanted to meet Jignesh Shah, the founder and promoter of FT
 apat hi enesiel kii holding company he
 Brokers have lost crores of rupees due to the closure of the commodity exchange business
 funs chuke the or ve apana paisa waapas chaahate the
 But to avoid them, Jignesh slips through the back door of the house
 enesiel ko kareeb 13,000 inwestors kaa 5,500 karod ru
 Have to pay
 usne inwestors ke bakaayaa bhugtan ke liye aath maheene kii yojana taiyaar kii thi, lekin iske baad bhi vah difolt kar gai
 Until a few days ago, NSEL had invested about Rs 300 crore in investors
rs
 waapas kiye hai, lekin isamen se kareeb 177 karod ru
 The promoters of NSEL have been taken as a bridge loan from Financial Technology
 jignesh lagaataar logon se bachane kii koshish main hai or hamaare baar-baar bheje gaye sawaalon kaa unhone koi jawaab nahin diya he
 Once portrayed as an example in the business community of Mumbai, Shah built an empire of about nine exchanges in India and abroad within 15 years
 lekin enesiel ke asafal hone se unki vishwasaneeyata ko baari batta laga he or iskaa unke duusare kaarobaar par bhi asar dikhaai degaa
 Shah's image began to rebound when it was revealed that many clients of brokers of NSEL had taken positions in long-term forward contracts (futures deals), while the exchange was traded only in spot contracts (spot deals) of the commodity Only permission has been granted
 isse bhi gadabadjhaale kii baat yah rahi ki enesiel ne 25 se 45 din ke forward contract kii manjuuri bina yah jaanch kiye de di ki jis camodity ke liye yah sauda kiya ja rahaa he, vah godaam main vastav main jamaa kii gai he yaa nahin
 But one businessman said on the condition of anonymity, "the exchange had become a bank for us
 isamen puri tarah se funding kaa khel hota he
 We get capital easily without getting entangled in the long process of the bank
 ” baat yah bhi he ki jaruri nahin ki is fund kaa istemaal camodity kaarobaar ke liye hi kiya jaataa ho
 Sources allege that people invested money received from NSEL in other investment instruments like real estate and gold
 lekin gold or real estate donon main mandi aane kii vajah se isamen se paisa nikaalnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Due to this, the incidence of default started increasing
 inakam tex vibhaag kii jaanch main bhi isaki pushti ho rahi he
 Mumbai's Income Tax Department investigation has revealed many startling facts
 visphotak yah he ki enesiel kaa hajir kaarobaar bas dikhaane ke liye hi tha or vah is plateform kaa istemaal udhaar lene or dene main kar rahi thi
 During investigation, the department found that the warehouse receipts submitted to the exchange were fake and no consignment was kept for the same
 zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa he ki enesiel ke jo registerd warehouse (godaam) hai unamem itnaa maal hi nahin he jisase inwestors kaa paisa lautaaya ja sake, isliye shah chaahate hai ki kuch bich kaa rasta nikal jaae
 Ashok Mittal, president of the Commodity Participants Association of India, says, "even if some warehouse has goods, no one knows who owns it
" ho saktaa he ki is maal ko bank yaa kisi anya sanstha ke paas girvee ke taur par rakhaa gaya ho
 "but businessmen insist that they are being unnecessarily targeted
 aasthaa group ke chairman evam managing diarector mohit agarwal kaa maananaa he ki prashasan ke log unke jaise kaarobaariyon ke saath bahut sakhti se pesh aa rahe hai
 The two companies of Aastha Group, Aastha Minmet and Jagranat Projects, received Rs 250 crore from investors
 chukaane hai
 Aggarwal said, "I don't understand why we are being treated like scamsters
 main steel main trade karata tha or vah exange ke paas padaa he
 They can sell that steel to recover their money
 ”enesiel main jo kuch ho rahaa tha, kya iske bare main jignesh shah ko pataa tha? zyada sambhaavna isi baat kii he ki unhen isaki jaankaree rahi hogi
 Sources say that Jignesh himself gave a presentation to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and the Forward Markets Regulator (FMC) about the promised deal
 pehle to har koi paisa bana rahaa tha or kisi ne bhi shikaayat nahin kii
 127 crore to NSEL in FY 2012-13
 kaa shuddh munafa hua jo apat ke consolidated munaafe kaa 56 fisadi tha, iske pichley vitt varsh main iskaa hissaa mahaj 10 fisadi tha
 The NSEL incident is a major setback for FT and Jignesh Shah
 apat kii enesiel or emsiex aadi main hissedari he, lekin apat kii zyaadaatar kamai apane exange ke sabsidari or brokar ko technology kii aapurti se hoti he
 The exchange's stalled means that its large source of earnings will dry up
 isse camodity exange emsiex ko to koi bada nuksaan nahin hoga, lekin vahaan bhi yahi sab kaarobaari hai or enesiel main pement ke difolt hone kii ghatana se uske trading wolum main giravat aa gai he
 FT holds a 26 per cent stake in MCX
 2011-12 main use dividend or technology saport fees ke rup main emsiex se 107 karod ru
 Have met
 lekin sabase zyada jhtka lag saktaa he jignesh ke bade daanv emsiex-eseks ko jo bhartiya share bazaar kaa sabase nayaa exange he
 If the big issues of corporate governance related to FT Group continue to come up in this way, then no institutional investor would want to do business on this exchange
 company ke ek vakil ne kaha, ''jignesh shah or board ke anya diarector ke khilaaf aapraadhik karrwai ho sakati he, lekin ek company ke rup main apat par koi khatra nahin he
 It is a separate company and in this case only the assets of NSEL can be seized to recover the money
 ”motilal oswaal financial services ke siemdi motilal oswaal ne kaha, ''agar unka iraadaa he to unhen inwestors ko aashwast karnaa hoga ki unka paisa waapas milegaa
 Today, we have no confidence in this group and like other brokers, we are advising our clients to withdraw their money from other companies of the group
 ”giyojit bnpi pariba financial services ke managing diarector si
 J
 jorge ne kaha, ''brokar ek exange ke saath kaarobaar kar rahe the jise sarkaar ne license diya he or vah kanoonsammat ikai he
 Therefore, it is the responsibility of NSEL to pay investors whose money is stuck
 kisi kaarobaar ke liye kharidaar or vikreta ke bich exange counter guarantee party hoti he
 The income tax department's investigation has also revealed the shocking fact that many big brokers who created a lot of uproar on it were already aware of the irregularities in NSEL
 iske alaava enesiel jin 24 difolt form kii baat kar rahi he unamem se zyaadaatar sahi tarah kaam karne vaali companiyaan hai
 The Income Tax Department will soon submit its report to the Ministry of Finance
 enesiel se jude 16 brokers main se sheersh 10 ne kareeb 1,000 bade inwestors (echenai) kaa 3,500 karod ru
 Invested
 lekin hairat kii baat yah he ki sansad ke haal main sampann manusan satr main sarkaar or vipaksh donon ne enesiel sankat par vistaar se charchaa karne kii jarurat nahin samajhi
 After all, why are political parties silent on this matter? The government has constituted a committee headed by Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram a few days ago to investigate the matter
 samiti ne apni report mayaram ko saunp di he
 According to sources, there is a reference to violation of Foreign Exchange Law (FEMA)
 is bich enesiel pramanit 20 warehouse kii switzraland kii audit form esgs ne audit karne par inwestors kii chintaa badhaane vaale tathy pesh kiye hai
 Only 15% of the declared goods have been found in these warehouse transactions on NSEL
 sutron ke anusaar kaayade se in warehouse main 2,200 karod ru
 Should have had a consignment of Rs, but there was only Rs 300 crore
 kaa maal mila
 After all, how could a warehouse issue a receipt without checking the value or security of a commodity? Such a huge difference between the shown and actual goods proves that it is not just mismanagement
 isse enesiel ke apane auditor kii bhoomika par bhi sawaal khadey hote hai ki aakhir use pehle yah sab pataa kyon nahin chalaa?enesiel ke auditor mukesh pi
 Mukesh Shah, promoter of Shah & Co, says, "the book of 2012-13 was sound
 hamane to enesiel par hue len-dein ke 75 fisadi hisse kii jaanch kii thi or hamen inamen koi gadabad nahin dikhi thi
 Last year, NSEL moved its auditor firm SV Ghatalia (member firm of Ernst & Young Global) to Mukesh Shah & Co
 sutron ke anusaar esavi ghatalia or enesiel ke bich maal ke milan par matbhed ho gaye the, is vajah se auditor form enesiel ke bahi-khaaton par dastakhat nahin karnaa chaah rahi thi
 We have not been able to get any response from any of the executives of Young and Young
 ek or sawaal kaa jawaab nahin mil paa rahaa ki aakhir trading band hone ke baad enesiel kaa setlement guarantee fund (esagf) rahasyamay tareeke se kaise gaayab ho gaya
 It was earlier being told that the fund was worth Rs 800 crore
 kaa he, lekin ab yah sirf 60 karod ru
 Is visible mukesh shah ne bataaya, ''vastav main july, 2013 tak esagf main 800 karod ru
 Were
 inamen phixd dipogity raseed, mutual fundon main investment to sahi hi the or inaki bainkon ne jaanch bhi kii thi
 "jignesh is trying his best to save his skin from the mess of the National Spot Exchange and is blaming it on his management's head
 enesiel ne apane purv siio anjani sinha or unki team ke khilaaf mumbai police kii aarthik aparaadh shakha (eodblyoo) main aupchaarik taur par shikaayat darj kii he
 The board has alleged that the earlier management was probably in collusion with defaulting firms in payment
 iodblyoo ne isaki jaanch ke liye ek vishesh jaanch dal banaaya he
 Only after this investigation will the Mumbai Police register an FIR
 enesiel ko bhi aapraadhik karrwai kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 The Center is considering taking action against its officials by registering several cases like money laundering
 is tarah kii karrwai hui to sarkaar jignesh kii vyaktigat sampatti ke saath hi apat or uski sahaayak companiyon kii sampatti jabt kar sakati he
 Jignesh is trying to save himself by implicating Sinha
 halaat bahut bure hue to apat, enesiel se apni investment ko baahar nikaal sakati he
 Experts believe that FT Commodity Exchange may also sell its 26 per cent stake in MCX
 bada sawaal yah he kiakhir sarkaar karrwai main itani der kyon kar rahi he? a case of racial discrimination has come to light with three IIT students of the country who went for internship in Italy
 teenon chaatr ventimiglia main train kaa intjaar kar rahe the tabhi sthaneey surakshakarmiyon ne unhen passport check karne ke bahaane roka or shahar se kareeb 110 kimi dur le gaye
 One of the three students, Uday Kusupati, is an IIT Mumbai student and the other two are Akshit Goyal and Deepak Bhatt from IIT Delhi
 ye teenon chaatr inariya sophia atipolis meditarenicompanemen may se internship kar rahe hai or weekend par geneva ja rahe the
 Then the security personnel took them from there on the pretext of seeing the passport
 10 ghante tak kisi se nahin kar paae samparkchaatro ne bhartiya duutavas main is puure ghatnakram kii likhit shikaayat kii he or bataaya ki shuruyaat ke 10 ghante tak wo kisi se madad nahin le paae
 After this he somehow contacted his family
 philhal ve sabhi rome main hai
 So what happened because 
 
 maamla saamne aane par italy ke council general ugo kiyarlatani ne kaha, 'italy ke log racist nahin hai
 You can see that a large number of Syrian people are coming to Italy daily
 yah ghatana isi vajah se hui hogi

 Elections are going to be held in Uttar Pradesh early next year
 sabhi kii nazren is pradesh par tiki hui hai
 Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi has rallied in Phulpur and burnt the election bugle
 is bich uttar pradesh main ek or badi hasti kii maujuudagi ne kaaphi surkhiyaan batorin
 Many people were watching this person
 lakhon logon ke guru shrishri ravishankar pradesh ne kuch behad khaas vidhansabha kshetron main jaakar logon ke bich bhrashtachar ke khilaaf alakh jagaane kaa kaam kiya
 Almost all the major parties were busy turning their four-day program in their favor, but religious gurus are far from it
 apane amethi daure ko achaanak radd karne ke baad shrishri ne khaas baatcheet main bataaya ki kis-kis tarah ke dabaav un par daale jate hai
 Q: What was the purpose of the Uttar Pradesh Yatra and were you successful in it? Answer - Uttar Pradesh Yatra is a part of the routine yatra for me and i have been here for many years
 yahaan ke sthaneey logon kii maang ke anusaar main yahaan aane kii taarikh nishchit karata hum
 No politics should be associated with my Uttar Pradesh tour
 yah yatra mukhya rup se dharmik thi
 Yes, some social issues also arose during this, as has happened in any of our other journeys
 satsang hameshaa hi divya shakti pradaan karne vaale hote hai or logon ke rispance ke saath yah aam baat he
 Q: Why did you cancel the Amethi trip? Was there any political pressure behind it? Answer: Actually the people of Rae Bareli came to Bangalore and they made a program of Satsang
 yahaan hamaare bahut saare anuyaayi hai
 He wanted to raise 1 lakh people in Rae Bareli
 jab ham is sab ke bare main plan bana rahe the, thik usee samay hamen amethi ke tikarmphi ashram se swami harichaitanya ke shatabdi samaaroh main shaamil hone kaa ek nyotaa mila
 Due to lack of time, we made a program to go to Amethi on the same dates except Rae Bareli's program
 jaise hi ham uttar pradesh pahunche, yahaan par hamaare sahyogi swami paramatej ji ko amethi ke swamiji ne phone par bataaya ki un par kis tarah kaa dabaav he
 He felt very sorry and was also ashamed to withdraw the invitation
 yahaan tak ki ve is baat ko hamen bhi nahin bataa paa rahe the
 i did not want to get into any controversy nor cause any trouble, so i agreed to cancel the Amethi Yatra and sent an apology letter to us
 pra- kya aapke saath is tarah ke dabaav vaale or koi prasang bhi hue hai
 Answer - i teach people how to handle pressure, so i know how to deal with pressure
 pra- anna hajaare ne to matadaataaon ko sidhe-sidhe kah diya ki congress ko vot mat do
 Are you going to take any such step in your campaign against corruption? Answer - My objective is very clear
 yah araajnneetik, bhrashtachar ke khilaaf, sadachaar or naitik mulyon par aadhaarit he
 We have raised our voice against corruption and we ourselves have been victims of corruption in Karnataka
 pra- chunavi daur main raajnneetik partiyaan aapako dusron ke khilaaf apana hathiyaar banaati hai
 Have you made a plan for BJP? uttar- main dusron kii avadharanaon or kisi kii agyanta par pratikriya dena pasand nahin karata
 Everyone has the right to show his sense of innocence
 lekin main ek baat saaf kar dena chahta hum ki agar main raajnneetik taur par kuch bhi karnaa chaahunga, to use shat-pratishat karunga
 If i had this feeling, i would go to all 75 districts and spend at least two days everywhere
 main puure teen maheene tak prachaar karuunga or apana 100 pratishat isi main duungaa
 i am smart enough to know that political benefits of any kind cannot be achieved by just a four-day trip
 jahaan tak congress kaa maamla he, to aapke pataa hona chaiye ki mere dada ji ne swatantraaa andolan main hissaa liya tha or ve 20 saal tak mahatma gandhi ke saath rahe the
 He gave all the assets of our family to them
 mere gurujan bhi mahatma gandhi ke kareebi the or unhone bhi unke saath kai dashak tak kaam kiya tha
 Apart from this, my father was a big fan of Pandit Nehru, but he also never participated in politics
 koi bhi vyakti jo bhrashtachar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaata he, use rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke saath jodakar nahin dekhnaa chahie
 Q: An opinion often comes out that religious leaders should not forget their domain and if they want to do politics then they should contest elections
 uttar- dharmik guruon ke peeche umad rahi bheed ko dekhakar raajnneetik netaaon ko ghabraana nahin chahie or kisi bhi tarah kii vipareet tippanee unke liye hanikaarak ho sakati he
 Q: How do you see the allegations of corruption on Team Anna? Is it due to transparency and lack of democracy in such movement? Answer - Government agencies should take action in this matter
 koi bhi vyakti kanoon se upar nahin he
 Any person who messes with the law should be punished
 jahaan tak main jaanata hum, team anna se jude hue log bahut hi patibaddh hai
 Due to some allegations in the media, you cannot call them misleading
 ve log tab tak bekasoor hai, jab tak unke unke khilaaf kuch sabit nahin ho jaataa
 Q- Team Anna is making a constitution for herself and it will be fully implemented in the team
 kya yah jaruri tha?uttar- team kaa prasar karnaa ek swaagatyogy kadam he or isse nirnay or loktantric ho jaaenge or team civil socity ko or acchhee tarah se pesh kar paaegi
 Q: Can a road movement, including fasting, change the parliamentary system? Answer - Not at all, the street movement will pressurize sleeping mps to take action
 pra- agar bulaayaa jaae, to kya aap bhi swami agnivesh kii tarah big bos ke ghar main jaaenge?uttar- main sirf ek ‘big bos’ ko janata hum or main har vakt unheen ke ghar main rahata hum

 bisisiai chif en shrinivasana kii kursi bachegi, bantegi yaa jaaegi
 It will be decided only a few hours from now
 chennai main dopaher kareeb dhai baje bisisiai kii varking kamity kii apaat baithak he
 Though there will be no voting in this meeting, it is believed that Srinivasan can present his resignation
 vaise sutron ke mutabik aisa karne ke liye unhone apni kuch sharte bhi rakhi hai
 According to the first condition, only one of the current board members should be made the chairman of BCCI
 duusari shart ye he ki shashaank manohar ko adhyaksh na banaaya jaae kyonki shashaank manohar ko virdohi kheme yani sharad pavaar kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 The third condition is that Srinivasan will appoint two vacant posts in the board as secretary and treasurer of his choice
 ipel main cricket kii kirakiri or bisisiai se kai bade naamon ke istife ke baad se hi shrinivasana par adhyaksh pad kii kursi chhodane kaa dabaav badhata ja rahaa he
 Now some other members are also getting indications that a lot has happened
 shrinivasana ko singhaasana chhodana hi hoga
 However, it is also believed that if Srinivasan's terms are not considered, then he cannot resign
 aise main meeting ke baad ek saajha formula nikalne kii baat bhi saamne aa rahi he
 In this situation, it is possible that Srinivasan will continue to be the chairman of BCCI while Shashank Manohar is made the executive chairman of the board
 baithak main teen sadasyeey jaanch samiti kii sthiti par bhi baat kii jaaegi, kyonki iske sadasyon main se ek jagadale istipha de chuke hai
 In fact, Srinivasan's son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan was forced to resign when he was detained by the Mumbai Police
 lekin shrinivasana tus se mas nahin hue
 Even senior officials from the BCCI quit irritably
 lekin shrinivasana ade rahe
 IPL President Rajiv Shukla resigned from the post on Saturday ahead of the BCCI Working Committee meeting to be held on Sunday
 rajeev shukla ke istife se shrinivasana ko karaara jhatka laga
 Earlier, two officials, Secretary Sanjay Jagdale and Treasurer Ajay Shirke have left the post
 sanjay jagadale ne jo kiya wo unka apana faisla tha
 But this decision would have shaken n Srinivasan
 kyonki sanjay jagadale adhyaksh shrinivasana ke behad kareebi maane jate hai
 And now N
 Srinivasan is surrounded by all four sides
 ab jo kuch bhi ho, jald ho jisase cricket par or bharat main ise control karne vaale mahanubhaavon par jo daag lage hai
 They should be washed as soon as possible

 Actor Naseeruddin Shah, who will be seen opposite Madhuri Dixit in Vishal Bhardwaj's film Dedh Ishqiya, said that he is a 'fanatic' of Dhak Dhak Girl and is keen to work with her again
 ‘dedh ishkia varsh 2010 main ai film ishkia kii agali kadi he
 Vidya Balan, Naseeruddin Shah and Arshad Warsi were seen in Ishqiya
 is nai film main nasiruddin or arshad to rahenge hi lekin vidya ke sthaan par maadhuri najar aaengi
 The comments aisa nahin he ki maadhuri or nasiruddin pehali baar sunahare parde par ek saath najar aaenge
 Prior to this, both have worked in Rajiv Rai's 'tridev', Pankaj Parashar's 'rajkumar' and MF Hussain's 'gajgamini'
 nasiruddin ne ek kaarykram ke avasar par kaha, ‘‘maadhuri or main pehle bhi kaam kar chuke hai or main unka prashasank hum
 i don't know how many of his films he has seen but i always think that she is a good actress and i look forward to working with her again
 ’’ 'dedh Ishqiya' is the sequel to the 2010 film Ishqiya
 ishkia main vidya balaan, nasiruddin shah or arshad varsi najar aae the
 Naseeruddin and Arshad will remain in this new film, but Madhuri will be seen in place of Vidya
 tippaniyan It is not that Madhuri and Naseeruddin will be seen together on the golden screen for the first time
 isse pehle donon rajeev raay kii ‘tridev’ , pankaj parashar kii ‘rajkumaar’ tathaa em epa hossain kii ‘gajagamini ’ main kaam kar chuke hai
 Naseeruddin said on the occasion of an event, "madhuri and i have worked before and i admire her
" main nahin jaanata ki meri kitni filmein unhone dekhi hai lekin main hameshaa sochataa hum ki vah ek acchhee abhinetri hai or mujhe phir unke saath kaam karne kaa intjaar he

 '' lambey samay se rajyasabha (rajya Sabha) main atka teen talaak bill (triple Talaq) mangalvaar ko paas ho gaya
 In the Rajya Sabha, 84 members voted in support of the bill and 84 in protest
 is bill ko paas karaane main kai kshetreey partiyon ne voting main hissaa na lekar bhi badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 Due to non-participation in voting by these parties, the majority figure was reduced and PM Modi passed this bill in the upper house
 teen talaak bill (triple Talaq Bill) ko lekar jammu-kashmir kii party pidipi ke saansadon kaa ravaiya bhi hairaan karne vaala rahaa
 In fact, two PDP mps did not participate in voting after the bill was introduced in the Upper House
 is vajah se bahumat kaa aankada or kam ho gaya
 And the Modi government was successful in passing this bill
 bataa den ki pidipi party kii adhyaksh mahabuuba mufti ne sadan main bill pesh hone se pehle kaha tha ki vah is bill ko lekar kisi bhi tarah se sarkaar kaa saath nahin dengi
 But the Modi government indirectly benefited from two party mps not participating in voting
 bataa den ki teen talaak bill ko lekar kuch din pehle hi mahabuuba mufti ne kaha tha ki modi sarkaar is bill ke sahare hamaare (muslim) ke gharon main ghusane kii koshish kar rahi he
 He also tweeted a tweet about the triple talaq bill
 unhone likhaa ki main yah nahin samaj paa rahi hum ki aakhir modi sarkaar is bill ko paas hi kyon karwaane par adi he, khaas kar tab jab supreme court ne ise gaiyr-kanoonee bataaya he
 This is being done only to punish the Muslims
 aisi sthiti main jab deshki arthvyavastha kii haalat inti kharaab chal rahi ho to kya sarkaar ke liye yah itnaa ahm mudda hona chahie?fail to understand the need to pass the triple talaq bill especially since the Supreme Court had already declared it illegal
 Undue interference seemingly to punish Muslims
 Given the current state of the economy, should this really have been a priority?gauratlab he ki vipaksh ke kade aitraaj or bill ko select cameti main bhejne kii maang ke bich teen talaak bill (triple Talaq Bill) rajyasabha se paas ho gaya
 Earlier, the opposition's demand to send the bill to the Select Committee also fell in the House
 voting ke dauranbill ko select cameti main bhejne ke paksh main 84, jabaki virodh main 100 vot pade
 Now this bill will be sent to the President for approval
 rajyasabha se teen talaak bill paas hona modi sarkaar kii badi jeet maani ja rahi he
 After the bill was passed, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that today is a historic day
 donon sadanon ne muslim mahilaon ko nyaay diya he
 This was the beginning of a prosperous India

 In such a situation, the crisis in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) may be clouded amid confusion about the formation of government in Maharashtra
 shivasena ko biemasi par kabja barkaraar rakhane ke liye congress ke saport kii jarurat padegi
 If the Congress also supported the Shiv Sena in the BMC along with the government, then the BJP which was still in power in the BMC, will go into opposition in the BMC along with the assembly
 aankadon par gaur karen to 227 parshadon vaali brihanmumbai mahanagarapalika main shivasena ke paas 94 or bijepi ke paas 82 parshad hai
 Together they had gained the power of BMC
 agar shivasena se bijepi alag hoti he to vah 114 ke jaadui aankade ko bhi kho degi
 In such a situation, it will need the support of congress-ncp with 36 councilors
 ek-duusare ke khilaaf ladaa tha BMC chunaavabrihanmumbai mahanagarapalika ke chunaav ke dauraan bhi shivasena or bijepi aamane-saamne aa gaye the
 The two then contested against each other
 is chunaav main bijepi ne shandaar pradarshan karte hue 82 siton par jeet darj kii, jabaki 2012 ke chunaav main use mahaj 31 siten mili thim
 Shiv Sena had got just two more seats from BJP i
e
 84 seats
 iske baad shivasena main emenes ke 6 or teen nirdaleey parshad shaamil ho gaye the
 Apart from this, another councilor had come to Shiv Sena's court
 bijepi ne kiya tha biemasi kii kursi par daawaabiemasi chunaav ke baad ek baar phir shivasena or bijepi saath aae
 During this time, the BJP claimed its claim on the BMC chair
 uskaa kahana tha ki is par hamaara haq banataa he
 Shiv Sena opposed this
 iske baad donon partiyon kii aam-sahmati ke baad biemasi kii kursi shivasena ke khate main gai thi
 Shiv Sena's Vishwanath Mahadeshwar became the mayor Shiv Sena made Vishwanath Mahadeshwar the mayor of BMC, while Hemangi Worlikar was made the deputy mayor

 prakhyat parmaanu vaigyanik anil kakodakar or smriti irani ke bich matbhed ab khulkar saamne aa gaya he
 Questioning the selection of IIT Directors, Anil Kakodkar said that during the selection process, only formalities were completed
 unhone aage kaha ki iaiti jaise bade institute main is tarah kii aupchaarikta puraa karnaa desh ke liye acha nahin he, chayan ke dauraan kaaphi soch-samajhakar faisla lenaa hota he
 Kakodkar believes that it is not right to interview 36 candidates in a day, doing so hinders the selection process, which may not lead to the selection of the right candidate
 darasal iaiti ropar, patna or bhubaneshwar ke diarectors chayan prakriya se asahmati ke baad kakodakar ne bombai iaiti ke board of gavarnence ke adhyaksh pad se 12 march ko istipha de diya tha

 Regarding not going to the meeting, he said that the iit-bombay Board of Governors meeting is over, and that is why i did not go there
 agar ve chaahate the ki main pad par bana rahun to main pad par hum kyonki main ek jimmevaar aadmi hum
 When asked that you will attend a meeting for the directors selection process, he said that this process is over

 Encouraged by a big win in both the previous matches, India will take on the field to name a five-match series in the fourth ODI against England
 duusari taraf kharaab pradarshan se pareshaan england vijayi lay main lautne ke liye koi kasar nahin chhodega
 The team is starting to prove itself with two consecutive big wins after a consistently poor performance in recent times and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will hope that his young players continue to perform well and register an unbeatable lead in the series by registering a third consecutive win
 Will succeed in doing
 bharat ke yuva or anubhavheen gendbaajon ne pichley do maichon main acha pradarshan kiya or jeet kii neenv rakhane main unhone ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Apart from this, the top-order batsmen in poor form have indicated a comeback
 dabaav nishchit taur par england kii team par rahegaa jinhen bharatiyon ko pisie stadium main shrinkhalaa jeetne se rokane ke liye preranadai pradarshan karnaa hoga
 This match is very important for both the teams and hence the match is likely to be exciting
 do badi jeet ke bajwood kuch vibhaag aise hai jo bharatiyon ke liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 These include not being able to walk the salute pair
 gautam gambhir haalanki acchhee shuruyaat kar rahe hai lekin vah ise badi pari main badalane main naakaam rahe hai
 Second opener Ajinkya Rahane is also not looking in rhythm and is unable to score
 isaki vajah se bharat shrinkhalaa main abhi tak acchhee shuruyaat hasil nahin kar paaya he (pehle vanade ko chhodkar)
 The Indian team management will probably not make any changes to the team that won the last two matches
 ravinder jadeja ne pichley do maichon main balle or gend se shandaar pradarshan kiya jisase antar paidaa hua
 The Indians are in dire need of an all-rounder to balance the team and Jadeja has filled the position well
 saurashtra ke is yuva alrounder ko haalanki nirantar acha pradarshan karnaa hoga
 Captain Dhoni is also happy with Jadeja's form as the current rules of ODI matches cannot be oversized by parttime bowlers like Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘vah (jadeja) nishchit taur par hamen santulan pradaan karata he
 In this context, Jadeja is the right player for us
 ham gendbaaji alrounder ke saath sangharsh kar rahe the
 Irfan (pathan) was the only player we had
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘naye niyamon se pehle ham yuvaraj singh or anya parttime gendbaajon se das over karavaate the
 After the new rules, Yuvi will take some time to adjust to them as a bowler
 ’viraat kohli kii farm main vaapasi bharatiyon ke liye acchhee khabar he kyonki haal ke toornament main madhyakram kaa lagaataar asafal rahanaa bharatiyon par baari padaa tha
 Yuvraj played small innings in the last match but he looked better in touch but needed a big innings
 dhoni shrinkhalaa main shuru se hi shandaar farm main chal rahe hai or ummid he ki ve use barkaraar rakhenge
 In the bowling department, fast bowlers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shami Ahmed have given impressive performances but veteran Ishant Sharma has not been able to perform consistently
 aaf spinner ravichandran aswin ne ranchi main acha pradarshan kiya tha
 England, on the other hand, has many concerns as both their batting and bowling departments have failed to meet expectations
 captain elistare cook test shrinkhalaa main jis tarah se bhartiya gendbaajon par haaavee rahe the, vanade siries main vah ab tak vaisaa pradarshan nahin kar paye hai
 The dangerous Kevin Pietersen has also failed to show up
 yah alag baat he ki ranchi main bhagya unke saath nahin tha kyonki unhen galat out diya gaya tha
 England batsmen have to struggle to play Indian spinners
 pichley do maichon main bhubaneshwar or ahamed ne english team ko shuru main jatke diye jisase uski team aakhir tak nahin ubar paayi
 The England captain said, 'we have to get on the field with open thinking

 We need to show our power at the crease by not talking about good batting

 The reason behind their escape from the house is due to beating up by parents, making a career in Mayanagari or meeting Facebook friends

 ' uttar pradesh main kabhi aatank kaa paryaay ban chuke munna bajrangi kii somvaar kii subah bagpat jail main tabadatod firing kar hatya kar di gai
 The purpose of shooting 8 to 10 of Munna Bajrangi inside the jail was clear, not only to kill Munna but also to create panic
 ho bhi kyon na, aakhir munna khud kabhi dehshat kaa doosraa naam rah chukaa tha
 But Munna Bajrangi, who used to fire 400 bullets on Gazipur MLA Krishnanand Rai in 2005, was a name that once emerged as a force of muscle power in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 krishnanand raay kii hatya ke baad faraar hue munna ko lagaataar 2 saal kii mehnat ke baad 2009 main mumbai se giraftaar kiya ja sakaa
 But very few people will know that Munna Bajrangi, who has been in the name of the police of many states and has created panic among people, entered the world of crime with a fine of 250 rupees

 Born in a peasant family in 1965, Prem Prakash did not mind farming, so he started learning carpet work
 14 saal kii umr main gharavaalon ne uski shaadi kar di
 Prem Prakash alias Munna Bajrangi's uncle got into a dispute with Bhullan Singh, a village man, only after 4-5 days of marriage
 bhullan ne bajrangi ke chachaa ko gaaliyaan deen jo bajrangi ko chubh gayi
 He just bought a pistol for 250 rupees and went straight to Bhulna
 munna bajrangi ne us 250 rupee kii pistal se bhullan par fire kar diya
 Bhullan was killed and Munna Bajrangi entered the world of goryam
 jaraayam kii duniya main kadam rakhane ke baad prem prakaash ne khud apana naam rakh liya munna bajrangi
 Just from here, Munna Bajrangi started executing taboo incidents and created such a furore that people started to panic in its name
 mukhtaar ansaari ke gang kaa khaas shooter tha munnamunna bajrangi vaise to 14 saal kii umr main aparaadh kii duniya main kadam rakh chukaa tha lekin jurm kii duniya main asal entry mafia don mukhtaar ansaari ke saath judane ke baad shuru hui
 Mukhtar was identified with Bajrangi by his friends Anil Singh and Kalam, who had been a Biwi Rabia MLA
 mukhtaar ke kehane par bajrangi ne kai hatyaein kin
 Once Bajrangi was shot, Mukhtar saved his life at that time
 phir to donon kaa saath or majboot ho gaya
 At the behest of Mukhtar, Munna Bajrangi murdered Kailash Dubey, the leader of the block and BJP leader, for the first time
 isi dauraan don se mukhtaar safedposh ban gaya or siyasat main uski entry vidhayak ke taur par ho gai
 Then Munna Bajrangi also got political patronage
 prem, shaadi or encounter1998 main munna bajrangi kii apane doston ke ghar seemaa singh se mulaakaat hui, jo baad main pyaar main tabdeel ho gaya
 Both of them got married after saving the eyes of the police in Haridwar
 lekin usee saal upi estf ne munna bajrangi ko gher liya
 Munna Bajrangi received several police bullets
 upi police ne to daawa kar diya ki munna bajrangi maaraa gaya
 When the police took him to the hospital, Bajrangi opened his eyes and thus saved his life, his daughter was born a few days after the encounter
 bajrangi saal 2002 tak tihaad jail main rahaa phir jail se chhootane ke baad mukhtaar kii madad se mumbai main apana thikaana bana liya
 Munna Bajrangi conspired to eliminate BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai after the BJP MLA got the decree from Khattar
 or usee ke chalate 29 november 2005 ko mafia don mukhtaar ansaari ke kehane par munna bajrangi ne krishnanand raay ko din dahaade maut kii neend sula diya

 During the post-mortem, 60 to 100 bullets were recovered from the body of each deceased
 is hatyakand ne soobe ke siyaasi halkon main halchal machaa di
 Everyone started to fear after the name of Munna Bajrangi
 is hatya ko anjaam dene ke baad vah most wonted ban gaya tha
 In front of the murder of the MLA, the reward of lakhs was on Munna's head, in many cases Uttar Pradesh Police, STF and CBI were looking for Munna Bajrangi
 isliye us par saat lakh rupee kaa inaam bhi ghoshit kiya gaya
 He is charged with involvement in several cases of murder, kidnapping and recovery
 wo lagaataar apni lokation badalata rahaa
 Police pressure was also increasing
 mumbai main lee thi panaahaupi police or estf lagaataar munna bajrangi ko talash kar rahi thi
 It was difficult to live in UP and Bihar
 dilli bhi uske liye surakshit nahin tha
 So Munna ran away to Mumbai
 usne ek lanbaa arsa vahiin guzaara
 During this time he also had to go abroad many times
 uske anderworld ke logon se rishte bhi majboot hote ja rahe the
 He was giving directions to his people on the phone from Mumbai itself
 raajnneeti main bhi aajamaai kismatek baar munna ne loksabhaa chunaav main gajipur loksabhaa seat par apana ekademi ummidavaarakhda karne kii koshish kii
 Munna Bajrangi was trying to get a woman ticket from Ghazipur to BJP
 jiske chalate uske mukhtaar ansaari ke saath sambandh bhi kharaab ho rahe the
 This was the reason that Mukhtar was not even helping his people
 bijepi se niraash hone ke baad munna bajrangi ne congress kaa daaman thama
 He went to the shelter of a powerful Congress leader
 congress ke vah netaa bhi jonpur jile ke rahane vaale the
 But lived in Mumbai and used to do politics
 munna bajrangi ne maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main netaa ji ko saport bhi kiya tha
 Such arrests were made in many states including Munna Uttar Pradesh, there were cases against Munna Bajrangi
 vah police ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban chukaa tha
 Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of cases against it
 lekin 29 oktober 2009 ko dilli police ne munna ko mumbai ke malad ilaake main naatakeey dhang se giraftaar kar liya tha
 It is believed that Munna was afraid of his encounter
 isliye usne khud ek yojana ke tahat dilli police se apni giraftaar karai thi
 The Mumbai Police was also involved in this operation of Munna's arrest at the last minute
 baad main dilli police ne kaha tha ki dilli ke vivaadaaspad encounter specialist rajbir singh kii hatya main munna bajrangi kaa haath hone kaa shaq he
 So he was arrested
 tab se use alag alag jail main rakhaa ja rahaa he
 During this time, cases like threatening, recovering people from his jail have also come up
 munna bajrangi kaa daawa he ki usne apane 20 saal ke aapraadhik jivan main 40 hatyaein kii hai
 Empire of 250 crores with 250 pistols, Munna Bajrangi, who made a foray into the world of crime by killing 250 pistols, had created an empire of 250 crores
 AK-47 jaise hathiyaar rakhane ke shaukeen munna bajrangi kii maut se uske kai sau karodon kii sampatti bhi dub jaaegi
 Actually, Bajrangi earned a lot from the crime, but the money was invested only through the police officers
 munna bajrangi na sirf mukhtaar ke saath milakar peedblyoody, sadak or railway ke theke kaa kontract letaa tha, balki akele bhi is dhandhe main pair jamaa chukaa tha
 It has many properties in UP Mumbai Jharkhand

 Saamana's editorial writes that the BJP was a half-chadhi party for Pawar before the election
 apane paap chhipaane ke liye ensipi satta main aana chaahati he
 Pawar's secularism is false
 piem ne ensipi ko nechurali karpt party kaha tha
 The public has completely rejected the NCP Congress

 Our effort is not to pollute the Ganges of development

 ghaaton kii nagari kaashi ke ganga tat par aasthaa kii bhi ganga bahati he, jisame desh-videsh ke bhakt na sirf dubkee lagane aate hai, balki apni aasthaa ko sahej kar bhi rakhte hai
 Ram Ramapati Bank does the work of preserving this faith of the devotees
 desh ke iklaute aasthaa ke is bank main ab tak duniya bhar ke bhakton ke likhe 25 arab ram naam jamaa he or iske khataadharakon kii sankhya lakhon main he
 The spiritual deeds of the people are kept in this bank located in a house in Vishwanath Gali, Varanasi
 ram navami ke din is bank kaa vishesh hota he, kyonki is din saikadon bhakt yahaan saal bhar kii likhi ram naam kii puunji jamaa karne aate hai
 One of them, Meera, has come here to deposit the same capital wrapped in red clothes in his hands, which he took as a loan after opening the account here
 mira kahati hai ki maine isi bank main apana khaataa khulwaaya tha or yahaan se ram naam likhane kaa qarz liya tha aaj vah puraa ho gaya he to usee ko yahaan jama karne ai hum
 Like Meera, there are lakhs of account holders in this Ram Ramapati bank, who have opened accounts here to fulfill their wishes and take the responsibility of writing Ram's name
 takreeban 85 saal se chal rahe is bank main desh hi nahin, balki videsh ke lakhon bhakton ne ab tak lagbhag 25 arab se zyada ram naam jamaa kara chuke hai, jise yah bank sahej kar rakhe hue he
 The account holders of this bank believe that their birth is improved by this, as well as their interest in this capital named Ram also improves their hereafter
 lagbhag 85 saal pehle shuru hue is bank main har kisi ke likhe ram naam ko nahin rakhaa jaataa, balki iske liye baqayada khaataa khulwaaya jaataa he
 For this, the form of Ram Rama Pati Bank has to be filled
 is farm main unke naam pate ke saath unke manorath ko bhi likhaa jaataa he, jise puri tarah gopneey rakhaa jaataa he
 It is not easy to open an account here, because it has the periphery of pickle ideas and their own rules
 jise puraa karne kaa vachan dene vaale ko hi yahaan se ram naam likhane kaa kagaz miltaa he or usee par inhen likhnaa hota he
 Ram Ramapathi Bank's employee development states, 'there are some rules for those who take the loan of Ram name, in which things like alcohol, meat, fish, onion, garlic etc
 are not to be eaten
 ' There is not only faith in the people associated with this bank, but also trust that with the name of Ram, which they deposit here, their public will not only improve, but their interest will also be better than this

 yoga guru ramdev ne congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi or daliton ke khilaaf die gaye apane aapattijanak bayaan ke liye maafee maangi he
 In Vadodara, Ramdev said that if anyone is hurt by his statement, he apologizes for it
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki unke bayaan ko tod-marodakar pesh kiya gaya
 However, before this, an FIR was registered against him in the metropolitan police station of Lucknow
 udhar, ramdev ke bayaan se gussaye congress kaaryakartaaon ne rashtriya anusuchit jati ayog or rashtriya mahila ayog main isaki shikaayat kii thi
 Earlier, Congress leader Digvijay Singh wrote on Twitter that Ramdev's statement is against the Dalits, he should definitely apologize
 ham chaahate hai ki ramdev ke bayaan par bijepi or modi bhi apni raay jaahir karen
 It is noteworthy that Baba Ramdev had made objectionable comments about Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and said that he goes to honeymoon and picnic at Dalits house
 ramdev ne kaha tha ki vah (rahul) daliton ke ghar honeymoon or picnic manaane jate hai
 But if he had married a Dalit girl, his luck would have awakened and he would have become the Prime Minister
 unhone tanj karne ke lahaze main kaha ki modi or baba ramdev rahul kii tarah majaburi main fakir nahin bane hai
 Ramdev said that the fate of that poor fellow is bad
 uski mummy kahati hai ki agar tum videshi ladki se shaadi karoge to pradhanmantri nahin ban paaoge or vah deshi ladki se shaadi nahin karnaa chahta
 His mother wants him to become the Prime Minister first and then bring a foreign girl

 In such a situation, the Ministry of Women and Child Development has given such an answer in Parliament, which everyone should be surprised to hear
 mantralay ne sansad ko bataaya ki rape peeditaaon ke liye banaaya gaya nirbhaya fund kaa zyaadaatar hissaa istemaal hi nahin hua
 This reply was given by the Ministry on 29 November

 himachal pradesh, maharashtra, madhya pradesh, karnataka, jharkhand, rajasthan, pashchim bengal or goa jaise rajyon ko mahila helpline ke liye die paise jas ke tas pade hai
 The Delhi government also did not spend a single penny of the Rs 50 lakhs received under this head, while the biggest agitation for the Nirbhaya case was done eight years ago by Arvind Kejriwal and his associates
 kendriya grih mantralyaki ore se vibhinn yojanaon ke tahat andhra pradesh ko die 58
 Not a single penny was spent out of 64 crores rupees

 Similarly, out of the 12 states to which the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development gave funds, 8 states did not use that money

 number 4 par vijay shankar kii naakaami ke kaaran bharat kaa middle order bich ke overon main ran nahin juta paa rahaa he
 Shankar is unable to show due to Damavijay Shankar's weakness, the lower order is under pressure, due to which India has not been able to score 300 in two consecutive matches

 Shankar was dismissed for just 14 runs off 19 balls against the West Indies
 pant kii maang hui tezshankar kaa world cap main chayan number 4 ballebaaj ke taur par hua tha, lekin vah lagaataar flop ho rahe hai
 Shankar has scored 58 runs in three matches played in the World Cup so far
 world cap ke liye jab team india kaa elaan kiya gaya tab vijay shankar ko mukhya chayankarta emesake prasad ne 3D khilaadi bataaya tha
 Vijay Shankar was preferred over Ambati Rayudu
 bataa den ki shankar ne pakistan ke khilaaf 15, afghanistan ke khilaaf 29 or west indies ke khilaaf 14 ran banaae hai
 After this disappointing performance of Vijay Shankar, the demand for Rishabh Pant to be included in Team India's playing XI has increased

 In Chhattisgarh, the tribals who collect tamarind from the forests and produce it have broken their back
 sthaneey bazaar main imali kaa daam 20 rupye kilo tak aa gaya he
 Middlemen are making a profit by buying cheap tamarind, but nothing is coming in the hands of tribals
 adivasee pradhanmantri seimlika samarthan mulya badhaane kii maang kar rahe hai, lekin unhen sirf aashwaasan hi mil rahaa he
 After the export of tamarind in Pakistan, the economic condition of the tribals is getting worse

 Fall in price In such a situation, the price of tamarind comes down to the ground
 bastar main imali ke daam bazaar bhav 80 rupye kilo se girakar 20 rupye kilo tak pahunch gaya he
 In such a situation, the tribals who collect tamarind from the forests and collect it from the forests are hardly getting 20 to 30 rupees per day
 darasal imali kaa samarthan mulya kai saalon se 20 rupye ke bheetar hi sthir he
 There has been no increase in it
 iske baavjood iske khariddaar samarthan mulya se bhi kam keemat aankatein hai
 So these tribals are demanding a new fix of tamarind government price to remove their economic distress
 taaki inhen ausat mazdooree to mil sake
 The demand for tamarind is only in the southern states of the country
 shesh rajyon main isaki ausatan maang hi rahati he
 Tamarind has a tremendous yield in Bastar
 yahaan iske baari bharkam jangal hai
 This gives tribals the support of livelihood
 teen saal pehle tak yahaan se har maah karodon kii imali kii khariddaari hoti thi
 There has been a lot of shipment, local businessmen, businessmen and middlemen used to get influx here
 imali ke kaarobaari yahaan se imali kii khep pakistan niryaat kiya karte the, lekin pichley teen-chaar saalon se bharat-pakistan ke bich tanaav bharaa maahaul hone se imali kaa niryaat puri tarah se thap pad gaya he
 Due to this, the economic conditions of the tribals became weaker day by day
 pehle ve 80 rupye kilo kii dar par imali bechaa karte the, lekin ab imali kaa uthaav nahin hone se unhen baari chapat lag rahi he
 The price of tamarind has also come down significantly
 imali kaa kaarobaar thap padane or 'aamadani aththni or kharchaa rupaya' vaali sthiti ne bastar ke hajaaron adivaasiyon kii mushkilen badha di he
 There is no concrete means of employment in this area

 In such a situation, the problem of livelihood has become with the tribals

 At the same time, Chief Justice gave some documents to lawyer Fali Nariman of Alok Verma and said that he should look into them carefully
 CJI ne isi ke saath ye bhi kaha ki ye dastavej aapako isliye nahin die ja rahe hai ki aap alok verma ke vakil hai, balki isliye die ja rahe hai kyonki aap desh ke varisht vakil hai
 The Chief Justice expressed displeasure over the ongoing news in the media and said that when the documents were given in a closed envelope, then how did it leak in the media
 sijeai ke is rukh par varisht vakil nariman ne kaha ki unhen ye nahin pataa ki media main ye baaten kaise chali gayi, balki kal jo jawaab talab karne ke samay main badlaav kiya gaya tha wo khabar bhi unhen media se hi mili thim
 Nariman said in the court that the media is independent so we cannot comment on it

 Both independent media and responsible media should be together

 According to this, the story is something like this

 unhone 2001 ke bukamp ke baad saraaf bazaar ke punarnirmaan main tatkaaleen jiladhikari pradeep sharma ke saath milakar sakriy bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Three years later Modi inaugurated the new market

 According to the tape, Shah also asked Singhal to increase the spying of Pradeep Sharma, who then became the corporation commissioner of Bhavnagar
 jasusi main maadhuri kaa peechha karne ke alaava uske kol record ko bhi khangaalana tha
 For about 62 days, Singhal and his team kept reporting on where she went, whom she met and why

 Mobile metadata was investigated to detect its movements

 On one occasion, a policeman was boarded on a flight from Ahmedabad to Mumbai

 Singhal, arrested in February this year in the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case, handed over 267 clips in two pen drives to CBI in June
 is purv aties adhikari ne amit shah se apni puri baatcheet tepe kar rakhi thi
 The BJP alleges that under the UPA government's conspiracy, the CBI did not file a charge sheet within the mandatory 90-day period of Singhal's arrest after promising to cooperate in gathering evidence against Modi and Shah in a fake encounter and in May Let him be released on bail
 singhl ne doston se kaha ki rajnatik netritv ham jaise afasaron kii madad nahin kar rahaa he, isliye maine aisa kiya
 On 15 November Singhal's tapes gave a huge blow to the BJP
 news portal cobrapost or gulel ne aawaaj kaa vah tepe jari kar diya ki kaise shah apane sahib ke kehane par ek mahila architect kii jasusi karvaa rahe the

 On the other hand, Modi's team in Gujarat brought a letter from Pranlal Soni and released it to the media on the same day
 patr main kaha gaya he ki jasusi unke aagrah par kii gai kyonki unhen apni beti kii suraksha kii chintaa thi
 But the release of the letter was reversed
 yah to dosha sweekaar lene jaisaa tha
 Those who defended Modi indirectly admitted that the state machinery was misused to spy on a person
 modi kii team is jasusi kaa do tarah se bachaav karti he
 They say that Soni and her daughter themselves do not want to investigate the espionage case, then what is the problem? Her second defense is that the woman's father wanted the safety of her daughter and believed that she was having an "illegitimate" relationship with the already married Pradeep Sharma
 gujarat sarkaar 1984 batch ke iees adhikari pradeep sharma se naaraaz rahi he
 The Modi government suspended him as collector of Kutch between 2003 and 2010 on corruption charges in five cases of land deals

 They are still suspended

 He expressed happiness in front of a group of government officials over the arrest of Vanzara and two IAS officers
 sutara ke mutabik, modi ne shah ko taal diya kyonki ve badale kii bhaavana kaa izhaar nahin hone dena chaahate the or pradeep sharma ko acchhee niyuktiyaan jari raheen
 Later, in 2009, when Shah presented evidence of Pradeep Sharma's anti-government activities, the Chief Minister took him seriously
 yah vahi samay he jab pranalal soni ne apni beti kii shikaayat modi se kii
 Investigation was set up against Pradeep Sharma for corruption in alleged land deals

 In this way, the procedures of institutional purity and law were defied
 supreme court ke disha-nirdeshon ke mutabik kya jasusi karne kaa adhikaar dene kii prakriya kaa paalan kiya gaya, rajya police ke ek varisht adhikari kehete hai, ‘‘prakriya to jarur apanaai gai hogi lekin aise record saal bhar ke bheetar hi nasht kar die jate hai
 Only Amit Shah can tell this and he has kept his mouth shut
 ’’bijepi kaa sankat, congress kii khusheeis ghatana ke saamne aane se congress ko to maano kamyaabi kaa nuskhaa mil gaya

 yah baithak kareeb maheene bhar pehle congress chunaav ghoshnaa-patr ke liye mahilaon se sambandhit muddon par suzav dene ke liye bulaai gai thi
 But this agenda was defeated and the President of Mahila Congress Shobha Ojha broke the Gujarat government's espionage case in between
 baad main ojha ne daawa kiya ki is masale par upasthit enjio ke logon main bhi rosh he or ve ise aage uthaaengi
 Ojha took two names in this case - Ranjana Kumari and Mohini Giri - clearly
 lekin jab yah mudda baithak main uthaa, usase pehle mohini giri ja chuki thim
 It was an uncomfortable situation for others
 isse chidhkar ranjana kumari ne kaha, ‘‘hamen mahila aarakshan vidheyak or duusare mahatvapurn maamalon main vichaar-vimarsh ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha lekin mujhe takalif he ki congress iskaa rajnatik phayda uthaane kii koshish kar rahi he

 Sreekumar accused Modi of spying talk and said that he was accustomed to misuse the state machinery for personal retaliation
 dilli main ek press conference main shrikumar ne kaha ki bijepi un par nishaanaa saadh rahi he
 He claimed that during his deployment to Gujarat, he was asked to spy on Congress leaders Shankar Singh Baghela and Haren Pandya in 2002, but refused to do so
 2003 main rahasyamay paristhitiyon main maare gaye bijepi netaa haren pandya ko bhi modi virdohi bataaya jaataa he
 The loyalty of the Modi government is bound to be questioned
 varisht vakil tathaa sibiai ke adhivaktaa vikaas paahwa ne india today se kaha, ‘‘bhartiya telegraph kanoon ke tahat rajya ko jasusi karne kaa adhikaar he lekin yah sirf saarvajanik immergency ke halaat main hi kiya janaa chahie, jahaan rajya kii suraksha yaa saarvajanik vyavastha ke bhang hone kaa khatra ho

 Modi's dilemma is complex

 Such a confession will make it extremely difficult for his most valuable political ally, Amit Shah
