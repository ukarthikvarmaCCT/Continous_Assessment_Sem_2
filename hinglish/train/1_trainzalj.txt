 About 2 hours on Monday, there was a fierce debate in the court after which the court ordered a verdict on it tomorrow
 ensipi-congress or shivasena kii ore se maang kii ja rahi thi ki 24 ghante ke andar floor test kiya jaae
 Mukul Rohatgi said that the floor test can take place at any time during the hearing in several floor tests within 24 hours
 ye faisla spikar ke upar he
 Today they are saying that they have 54 mlas, tomorrow i can say the same
 floor test karana spikar kii jimmedaari he, isamen court kii jimmedaari kya he? mukul rohtagi ne kaha ki court kaa koi sawaal hi nahin he
 Here, there is no question of horse trading, rather the whole group has gone the other way
 agar rajyapal kehete hai ki aaj floor test nahin hona chahie or unhen apana kaam karne diya jaae
 On this, the Supreme Court said that it is not yet a position
 is prakaar ke kai cese hai, jinamein 24 ghante ke andar floor test hua he
 The Solicitor General replied that it is the Governor's decision, will the court decide the assembly's agenda? This will have far-reaching consequences
 solicytor ne bataaya ki bijepi ke paas 105 apane, ensipi 54 or 11 nirdaleeyon kaa samarthan he
 The Governor had received a letter of support from all the mlas
 is par supreme court ne poocha ki wo chitthee kahaan he jisamen rajyapal ne fadanvis ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya tha
 
 
 When asked who is from Ajit Pawar, Mukul Rohatgi said that what is happening in the Pawar family does not make sense to him
 ek pavaar mere saath hai or ek court main, vah hastakshar galat nahin bataa rahe hai, balkihorse tradingka aarope laga rahe hai
 The Supreme Court said that we are not saying anything about the Governor here, the matter is different here
 justise khanna ne is dauraan kaha ki aap beete kal kii baat kar rahe hai, yahaan ajit pavaar kii taraf se koi he?iske baad ajit pavaar kii taraf se paksh rakh rahe maninder singh ne kaha ki main hi ensipi hum or main hi netaa hum
 Tushar Mehta said that the governor will also have to see who will give a permanent government? Ajit Pawar's lawyer said that the list i have given is completely correct
 jaise bhi ho faisla nikalnaa chahie, chaahe court se nikle yaa phir rajyapal se
 Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued on behalf of NCP
 singhvi ne kaha ki agar donon paksh floor test ko taiyaar hai to deree kyon ho rahi he
 He said that if something is being hidden then it is fake
 ajit pavaar kii chitthee puri tarah se farji he
 On behalf of Abhishek Manu Singhvi, the letter was called Paramukul Rohatgibhadar and he raised a strong objection
 is dauraan abhishek manu singhvi ne 48 ensipi, 56 shivasena or 44 congress vidhayakon kaa samarthan patr saunpane kii baat kahi
 Mukul Rohatgi objected to this, to which the court said that if you file this then i will have to take a reply from them
 jiske baad abhishek manu singhvi ne chitthee waapas le lee
 Abhishek Manu Singhvi has argued that the court should immediately order a floor test, first the pro tem speaker should be appointed
 bisisiai sachiv ajay shirke ne guuruuvaar ko spasht kiya ki mukhya coach anil kumble kii company main shairdharak hone ke liye purv bhartiya ballebaaj vivies lakshmana ke khilaaf lagaae ja rahe hiton ke takaraav ke aarope galat hai
 Media reports said that Laxman, a three-member Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) member along with Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, was a shareholder in Kumble's company 'tenwick' when he was interviewed for the post of head coach
 haalanki bisisiai ne media vijyapti jari karke spashtikaran diya
 Shirke said in a media release, "the Board of Cricket in India (BCCI) wants to inform all concerned parties that VVS Laxman clarified before the work of the committee began to interview applicants for the post of head coach of the Indian cricket team
" The words made it clear his current position and prior involvement with Tenwick Sports
 ’’tippaniyan He said, "laxman had informed the BCCI that he had sold 5% of his total shares in Tenwick Sports in March 2016 and also declared that he no longer holds any shares in Tenwich Sports and that he is not authorized or Is not in an unauthorized position ’’ Shirke said, "therefore Laxman was not in a conflict of interest at the time of selection of the head coach of the Indian cricket team, so the speculations and conclusions being made in this regard are wrong
" ’’ However, BCCI gave the clarification by releasing a media release
 shirke ne media vijyapti main kaha, ‘‘bhartiya cricket board (bisisiai) sabhi sambandhit pakshon ko suchit karnaa chahta he ki bhartiya cricket team ke mukhya coach pad ke liye aavedakon ke saakshaatkaar lene ke liye samiti kaa kaamkaaj shuru hone se pehle vivies lakshmana ne saaf shabdon main apni vartmaan sthiti or tenvik sports ke saath purv main bhagidaari ko spasht kar diya tha

 '' shirke ne kaha, ‘‘isliye bhartiya cricket team ke mukhya coach ke chayan ke samay lakshmana hiton ke takaraav vaali sthiti main nahin the, isliye is sambandh main lagaae ja rahe kayaas or nishkarsh galat hai

 com / syf23r6dse On 21 December 2018, the CBI special court delivered a strange verdict
 sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ke jaj es je sharma ne kaha ki maamle main saboot paryaapt nahin he isliye sabhi 22 aropiyon ko bari kiya jaataa he
 Not only this, the judge found the death of Tulsi Prajapati right in the police encounter but left the alleged encounter of Sohrabuddin Sheikh unresolved
 donon muthbhedon main koi link nahin sabit hone kaa hawala de kathith sajeesh kii puri kahani ko hi darkinar kar diya
 But it did not tell who killed Soharbuddin and how Kausar Bi died? However, he grieved the death of all three
 sawaal he jab maut hui he to kisi ne to maaraa he par 13 saal main siaidi, sibiai kii jaanch or adalati mukademe ke baad bhi iskaa khulaasa nahin ho paaya
 Why? Sohrabuddin Sheikh's brother Rubabuddin Sheikh said that the law was blind but had heard that the CBI and the judge were also blind
 rubabuddin peedit parivaar se he isliye faisale ke khilaaf uski naaraazgi swaabhaavik he
 But even a person with little knowledge of law and office is unable to digest this decision of the court
 aisa kyon?vishesh sibiai jaj ne 21 disambar ko apana faisla sunaate hue ye mana ki soharbuddin kii maut goli lagane se hui lekin goli kisne maari ye sabit nahin ho paaya
 While on the morning of 26 November 2005, the claim of killing Sohrabuddin was made by the ATS of Gujarat and the police of Rajasthan
 ye sirf daawa nahin tha tatkaaleen dspi em el parmaar ne panchon ke saamne sabhi 8 goliyon ke khaali khol baraamad kar forencik lab main bhi bheja tha or forencik lab main sabit bhi hua tha ki 3 goliyaan ek bandook se, duusari 2 duusari ek bandook se, baaki ke 2 or 1 alag-alag bandook se chali thim
 Now, since all these bullets were fired by the police themselves with their service pistols and revolvers, their records could easily prove whether they had them that day or not? This was done but 2 years later in the year 2007
 tab purana record liya hi nahin gaya
 As a result, the policemen got a chance to retract
 jabaki ethesail kii jaanch main sabhi banduukon se goli chalane kii pushti hui or sabase badi baat he ki soharbuddin shaikh kii jaangh se nikaali gai bandook kii goli artical 27 ke taur par baraamad inspector en ech daabi kii bandook se chali thi is baat kii bhi pushti hui thi
 Moreover, accused serial number-7 Abdul Rahman, accused number-8 Himanshu Singh Rawat and accused number-9 Shyam Singh Charan were recorded in Roznama that they shot Sohrabuddin
 ye baat chargeshit main bhi ai thi
 Secondly, all the articles recovered above were neither recovered in the hospital nor from the body
 jaankaree ke mutabik sabhi artical em el parmaar ne aties ke daftar main panchon ke saamne baraamad dikhaae ye kahkar ki medical afasar gavaah pi dablyoo -74 ne police inspector en ech daabi ko aspataal main diye the
 This makes the matter of daub in the case very clear
 tulsi prajapati ko bhilwara main ek kiraaye ke makaan se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 It is alleged that Tulsi Prajapati was also arrested from Bhilwara on the same day that Soharbuddin had an encounter in Ahmedabad
 kya ye mahaj sanyog ho saktaa he yaa phir sajeesh kaa hissaa jaisaa ki chargeshit main aarope lagaaya gaya he?ye sawaal isliye uthaa he kyonki tulsi kii giraftaar kii taarikh jaan boojhkar 29 / 11 / 2005 ko dikhaai gai taaki donon hi maamalon ko jod kar sajeesh sabit naa ho sake
 Tulsi was picked up from Bhilwara on 26 / 11 / 2005 but the arrest was shown at Hathipol police station on the night of 29 / 11 / 2005
 jabaki udaipur ke espi dinesh em en kii manthali report main likhaa gaya he ki 29 / 11 / 2005 ko shaam 5 baje wo ambamata police thane gaye or vahaan hamid lala kii hatya ke aarope main giraftaar aropiyon se poochtacha kii thi
 While the diary recorded at the Hathipol police station, the time to bring the accused has been written for about 10 nights
 matlab tulsiram ko pehle se hi pakad kar ditten kar rakhaa gaya tha
 SHO Rannvijay witness PW-67 of the Ambamata police station had given a statement under 164 that SP Dinesh MN had told him that the arrests would be shown later
 haalanki adaalat main gavaahi ke dauraan wo apane puraane bayaan se mukar gaya
 Not only this, Tulsi Prajapati was also accused of firing on the Patel brothers in Ahmedabad
 isaliye ahmedabad aties police afasar chargeshit gavaah pi dablyoo -227 ne bhi tulsi prajapati se poochtacha kii thi
 In that report of the inquiry, Tulsi himself said that he was arrested on 26 November 2005 from Bhilwara
 soharabuddin shaikh or tulsi prajapati maamle main link ko sabit karne ke liye ye ek ahm saboot ho saktaa tha lekin hairaani is baat kii he ki mukademe main chargeshit gavaah pi dablyoo -227 ko kii adaalat main gavaahi nahin ho pai
 Similarly, Rajasthan Police officer Sudhir Joshi witness PW 159, under which 164 statement was also made, that accused number-7 means Police Inspector Abdul Rahman and SP Dinesh MN had told on phone only on 26 November that Tulsi Prajapati Sameer name Is hiding in a house in Bhilwara
 uske baad hi tulsi ko usee din bhilwara se pakadaa gaya
 But he retracted during testimony in court
 usne taarikh naa bataakar november maheene kaa aakhri saptaah bataaya
 At that time, it was the duty of CBI senior PPBP Raju to keep his old statements under section 164 in front of him
 lekin unhone aisa jaanboojhkar nahin kiya yaa galati se rah gaya ye pataa nahin
 According to the judge, accused serial number 7 Abdul Rahman has refused to be in Ahmedabad on that day in his discharge application
 rajasthan police ke di vaay es pi sudhir joshi kaa daawa he ki police inspector abdul rahamaan ke phone se unhen kol aayaa tha ki tulsiram bhilwara main kiraaye ke makaan main chupa he
 But neither Joshi nor Abdul Rahman's mobile phones were investigated
 rahamaan ke phone ke sidiaar or data uski lokation pataa chal sakati thi lekin wo bhi nahin kiya gaya
 Puranmal Meena, the driver of SP Dinesh MN of Udaipur, who was an important witness in the case, turned hostile
 log book main bhi sirf es pi dinesh em en ke visit kaa ullekh he
 Sub Inspectors Himanshu and Shyam Singh also could not prove that both were on the spot before or after the incident
 jaanch agency ne unka mobile phone jabt nahin kiya gaya naahi sidi mila jisase unki lokation mil sakati thi
 Even the mobile location of Gujarat ATS police officers was not taken
 aties ke inspector enech daabi jinpar soharabuddin ko 2 goli maarane kaa aarope he uskaa bhi maukey par hona sabit nahin ho paaya
 Because the police drivers also turned hostile in the court
 unka kahana he ki ham vahaan offis kii gaadi nahi le gaye the 
 We did not even go there
 rahi baat soharabuddin kii jaangh se mili goli kaa daabi ke revolver kii hone kii pushti kii to us revolver se goli chali thi ye to egge el main sabit hua, lekin wo revolver us din daabi ke paas thi ye record se sabit hi nahin ho paaya
 There was also no evidence of alleged gunning of the gods
 unke record bhi nahin jamaa kiye gaye
 The question of matching the guns with the empty cartridges could not be answered
 jaj ke mutabik, aspataal main soharabuddin ke shav kii pahchaan karne vaale divyespmail parmaar maamle main ahm gavaah ban sakate the lekin unhen aaropee bana diya gaya
 The judge claims that both the CID and the CBI also failed to prove their story
 sabooton ko sahi tareeke se jutaaye nahin gayi
 Primary evidence also could not be found
 main asahaay hum sibiai kii kahani ke mutabik, soharabuddin shaikh apni patni ke saath indore se hyderabad gaya tha
 The Gujarat ATS team went there
 soharabuddin shaikh apni patni kausar bi ke saath hyderabad se sangli kii bas main ja rahaa tha
 Tulsiram Prajapati was also in that bus
 tabhi 23 november ko hyderabad se peechha kar rahi police team ne bas rukvakar teenon ko utarkar apni hiraasat main le liya
 Tulsiram was later released but Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi were killed
 lekin jaj es je sharma kii maane to puure maamle kii teen-teen agenciyon ne jaanch kii
 But not a single agency could prove the fact that Sohrabuddin Sheikh and Kausar Bi were going from Indore to Hyderabad
 vahaan wo maaruti car se gaya ye bataaya gaya lekin car jabt nahin hui
 His friend Kalimuddin who claimed to have seen Sohrabuddin in Hyderabad was not taken into account
 tulsiram ke vahaan hone kaa daawa kiya gaya tha lekin usase bhi nahin poocha gaya
 The sister of Kalimuddin alias Naeemuddin, who was called Apa and who told the CBI that Sohrabuddin and Kausar Bi had come to Hyderabad, also did not support the CBI story
 unke hyderabad main rahane kaa koi saboot nahin milane se puri yatra kii kahani hi sandigdh he
 Even on the bus
 us bas kaa tikat bhi soharabuddin or kausar bi ke naam naa hokar kisi salmaan or shaikh ahamed ke naam book tha
 But it was not known who they were
 hairaani kii baat he ki naa to trevell agent or naa koi or un donon ke photo pahchaan paaya
 a Apte couple among the passengers had claimed to be in the bus after seeing their photo
 unka 164 ke tahat bayaan bhi hua tha lekin mukademe ke dauraan adaalat ke donon mukar gaye
 Sohrabuddin's brother Rubabudin once said that Sohrabuddin had told that he was going by Sangli bus
 lekin jab jaanch hui to rubabuddin kaa wo phone jamaa hi nahin kiya gaya
 Otherwise, he could know something
 bataaya gaya ki kausar bi us samay pet se thi
 But no medical papers were submitted for her and if she was pregnant, what was the point of sitting in a bus in Hyderabad to Sangli? If they go by car from Indore to Hyderabad then why a bus from Hyderabad to Sangli? It was told that a team from Ahmedabad ATS went to Hyderabad
 lekin koun si gaadi, vahaan kahaan ruke iske bhi koi pukhta saboot nahin pesh kiye gaye
 Even Nathuba Jadeja, driver of Gujarat ATS driving the Kalis car whose number was noted in CRPF guest house records, chargesheet witness PW 105 and another driver Gurudayal Singh charge sheet witness PW-106 who was a star witness
 unhone bataaya ki wo nambar plate unhone 22 november ko badali thi, jabaki registerd main 21 november ko hi wo number note kiya gaya tha
 After the kidnapping of both of them at Sidhu Dhaba in Pune, food is being told that they could not even be proved
 gavaah mukar gaye
 It was told that all were brought to Balsad from there
 balsad se tulsi ko jane diya gaya
 If both were to be killed, why was Tulsi abandoned and killed a year later? If he had to be killed too then only he could be shown killed in the encounter
 maamle main jo shikayakarta he rubabuddin shaikh use pataa hi nahin tha ki tulsiram prajapati bhi un donon ke saath tha
 Rubabuddin had told that Tulsiram had corrected a paper in Ujjain and regretted that it led to the death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh
 ye baat bhi saal 2006 main hui thi lekin usne saal 2011 main bataai
 Why didn't you tell me earlier? This was also heard from the jail inmates
 jail main suni sunai baat ko sach kaise mana ja saktaa he jab jail ke kaidi bhi apni baat se mukar gaye hon
 The cbi's story is that Tulsiram was in a bus from Hyderabad with Sohrabuddin, while the landlord from Bhilwara, from which Tulsiram was arrested, Chandan Kumar Jha has told that Tulsi was in that house for 15 days
 adaalat ke mutabik, jitani bhi kadi jodne kii koshish kii gai wo judi hi nahin
 So who killed Sohrabuddin could not be proved
 kausarabi kaa kya hua ye pataa nahin chal paaya
 The special thing is that despite so many flaws, Judge SJ Sharma has praised the lobbying officer Vishwas Meena and CBI Senior PPBP Raju, saying that both tried a lot to prove the case
 jaj ne apni tippanee main saaf kaha he ki maamle main sibiai ne sach jaanane kii bajaay pehle se likhi likhaai kahani ko sabit karne main lagi rahi
 The entire exercise was done for political purposes
 par ye bhi hakeekat he ki soharabuddin shaikh kii maut hui or kausar bi laapata he
 FIR registered for Sohrabuddin's encounter
 to koi to uske liye jimmedaar he
 But even after 13 years of CID and CBI investigations and trial in special court, it is like losing faith in the truth

 monsoon yun to garmi ke mausam se raahat dene kaa kaam karata he lekin isi monsoon kii vajah se fashneble dikhne ke aapke shauk par thodi si roak bhi lag jaati he
 The biggest problem of rain is that what is worn and what is not, after being soaked with it, many clothes take time to dry, then there is the fear of spoiling some
 aaie jaane, monsoon main kin 5 chizon ko pahanane se bachanaa chahie
 
 
 1
 aapaki fevorett jeensis mausam main genes pahananaa acha idia nahin he kyonki ye agar bhig gai to jaldi sookhegi nahin or agar keechad-mitti lag gai to aapaki pyaari genes kaa kharaab hone kaa dar bhi to he
 In such a situation, you can try jiggings
 yepahanane main comfortablehone ke alaava halki hone kii vajah se jaldi suukh bhi jaati hai
 2
 long scurts or plasomansoon ke mausam main sabase pehle aapako apni long scurts or plazo ko pack karke kuch din ke liye rakh dena hi acha rahegaa
 In this season, the clothes can be spoiled by mud-water and they are more surrounded, due to which there is a fear of getting dirty soon
 3
 Leather bags and clothes, if the leather goes or gets wet, takes a lot of time to dry as well as increases the risk of getting fungus
 isliye is mausam memledar kii chizon ko istemaalan hi karen to behatar rahegaa
 4
 halke color ke diziner shoongar aapke paas halke color ke diziner shoej hai to unhen sambhalakar shu rack main hi rakhaa rahane den
 The mud of rain can spoil their beauty and obviously you would not like it at all
 5
 Linen shirts and pantslinen cloth become very full when wet and at the same time it becomes transparent
 isliye is mausam main linen ke kapadon ko na pahananaa hi behatar he
 Linen clothes are mostly light colored, so even a slight stain on them looks bad

 When Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina celebrated the Awami League's overwhelming majority of 232 seats out of 300 in the general elections on 5 January, something was missing
 vajah thi bangladesh nesanalist party (bnpi) ke netritv main 18 partiyon kaa is chunaav kaa bahishkaar
 a day after the elections, Sheikh Hasina looked happy as well as some aggressors in Dhaka
 unhone apane un aalochakon ko khaarij kar diya jo unase vipakshi dalon ke bahishkaar or hinsa kii vajah se aam chunaavon kii vaidhata par sawaal uthaa rahe the
 24 people were killed in the violence on election day
 agle din unhone apni mukhya rajnatik virdohi begum khalida jiya ko ‘‘chup rahane or baatcheet karne’’ ke liye kaha
 Hasina will have a tough time facing international backlash over the elections
 america ne in chunaavon main vishwasaneeyata kii kami bataate hue dobaaraa chunaav karaane ke liye kaha he
 UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has criticized the Awami League and the BNP and appealed to the two to start a meaningful dialogue
 britain or canada ne bhi nakhushi jaahir karte hue kaha ki 300 siton main se aadhe se zyada par ummidavaar nirvirodh chune gaye
 The estimated 40 percent turnout was the lowest ever in 10 elections in the country
 yahaan tak ki lambey samay se hasina ke samarthak rahe bharat ne bhi saavdhaanee baratate hue bayaan diya, jisamen chunaavon ko ‘‘sanvaidhanik jarurat’’ or ‘‘bangladesh kii andruni prakriya’’ bataaya gaya
 Political scientist Imtiaz Ahmed at Dhaka University believes that re-election is necessary to satisfy international colleagues
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘sansadhano kii kami kii maar jhel rahe bangladesh ko garibi kam karne or vikaas kii yojanaon ke liye salanaa kareeb 3 arab dollar kii jarurat he
 For Hasina, the loss of international credibility is not the only concern
 24 janvari ko unki sarkaar ke paanch saal puure hone ke baad rajnatik gatirodh kii vajah se paidaa hua sankat or gahraane kii ummid he
 The violence triggered by the BNP since elections were announced in November is in danger of affecting the entire economy
 hinsa kii chhitput ghatnaayen jari hai
 The stalemate has led to major disruptions in highways, rail traffic, functioning and education
 desh main aarthik gatividhiyaan tham gai hai or bangladesh kaa mukhya niryaat yani kapadaa udyog, jisamen kareeb 60 lakh log kaam karte hai, gambhir rup se prabhavit hua he
 The factories are not able to function to their full potential as the 75-day long strike has disrupted the supply of raw materials and delivery of finished goods
 pichley saal disambar main hinsa kii vajah se mahangaai kii dar 0
 2 per cent increase to 7
 35 fisadi ho gai
 Nasiruddin Biswas, president of the Nasir Group of Industries, says, "I am eagerly waiting for the deadlock to end
 aisa na hua to khud ko bachaane ke liye mujhe majabuuran kharchon main katautee kerani hogi
 The Nasir Group is one of the largest industrial clusters in Bangladesh, with a turnover of around 25
 6 karod dollar kaa he
 Sheikh Hasina's government has blamed the jamaat-e-islami, which has long been an ally of Khaleda Zia's party BNP, for spreading terror and violence in Bangladesh
 2010 main shaikh hasina kii sarkaar ne jamaat-e-islamic ke un netaaon ke khilaaf mukademe shuru kiye the, jin par 1971 main bangladesh kii aazaadee kii ladaai ke dauraan narsanhaar main sahyog karne kaa aarope tha
 On 13 December, jamaat-e-islami leader Abdul Kader Mulla was hanged following a court verdict hearing the war crimes
 agast main supreme court ne jamaat ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit karte hue us par chunaav ladgaye kii roak laga di thi
 Political experts believe that Hasina will not hold fresh elections next year before the completion of war crimes cases
 bangladesh kii donon beghamon kii ladaai main chunaav kaa bahishkaar bada hathiyaar rahaa he
 Khaleda Zia also boycotted the general elections in 1988
 vah chunaav general hossain mohammad irshaad ke taanaashaahee shashan ke tahat karaayaa gaya tha
 Similarly, Sheikh Hasina boycotted the elections in 1996 when Khaleda was the Prime Minister
 hasina sarkaar ne jab khalida kii is maang ko khaarij kar diya ki 2014 kaa chunaav nishpaksh keretekar sarkaar kii dekh-rekh main karaayaa jaae to khalida ne chunaavon kaa bahishkaar kar diya
 Since then more than 120 people have been killed in violence and more than 900 buses were burnt
 jamaat ke sandigdh ugravadi alpsankhyak hinduon par hamale karte rahe hai, jo sarkaar ke liye chintaa kaa sabab he
 Hindus make up about 10 per cent of Bangladesh's population of 180 million
 satkhira, deenajpur or jessor jilon main hamalon or lutpaat kii khabaren aati rahi hai, jisaki vajah se hajaaron kii sankhya main hinduon ko apana ghar-baar chhodkar asthaayee shiviron main rahanaa pad rahaa he
 At the press conference on 6 January, Hasina opened the doors of conversation
 khalida maan bhi gayi
 He told the BBC, "there is no other way but dialogue
" ’’ par khalida kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kaa maujuuda kaarykaal khatm hone se pehle yah baatcheet honi chahie
 They have also put certain conditions, including that they be freed from informal detention at home
 ab hasina ke liye aage badaae kii baari he
 The eyes of the world are on them
 saal 1989 main tridev naam kii ek hindi film ai thi, jiske mukhya kalakaar nasiruddin shah, sani deol or jaiki shroff the
 After almost 30 years, Tridev has once again come in front of people
 magar is baar yaa kisi film ke rup main nahin, balki raajnneetik ekajutata ke parichaayak ke rup main saamne ai he
 In fact, before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, a poster is being seen in Bihar capital Patna these days, showing the picture of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav together
 in teenon netaaon kaa yah poster 30 saal puraane tridev film ke poster kii yaad dilaataa he
 The three leaders are seen in the film style posters
 rajanetaaon ke tridev ke is poster main ek sandesh bhi likhaa he, jisamen kaha gaya he, 'virodhiyon kaa karenge sarvanaash or kehlaayenge tridev
 'the message is clear that in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, these three leaders will be seen together in the electoral riot and will dust their opponents
 haalanki yahaan sawaal yah uthta he ki tridev ke is poster main dikhne vaali ekajutata kya vaaki jameen par dikhaai degi?yah sawaal yahaan isliye vaazib he, kyonki poster main akhilesh yadav aurrahul gandhisath-saath dikh rahe hai
 But the reality is that these two leaders are currently contesting against each other in the assembly elections in five states
 itnaa hi nahin, akhilesh yadav ne congress par aarope lagaate hue yahaan tak kaha he ki usee kii vajah se paanch rajyon main ho rahe vidhansabha chunaav main samaajawaadee party ke saath gathbandhan nahin ho paaya
 So it is clear that it seems a little difficult to bring the unity of these leaders appearing on the poster to the ground
 dilli main chunavi maahaul kuch aisa ban chukaa he ki lagata he jaise yah emsidi ke nahin, loksabhaa yaa vidhansabha ke chunaav hon

 Ever since the list of National Register of Citizens has come up in Assam, BJP leaders on the other hand tell the number of Bangladeshi infiltrators in Bihar in lakhs and are demanding to implement NRC here too

 Modi said that Jammu and Kashmir and Assam are border states where due to the negligence of Congress governments, the continued infiltration from neighboring countries for several decades had adversely affected the culture of these states, losing employment opportunities to the local people
 There were serious challenges to the security of the country

 supreme court kii nigaraanee main ghuspaithiyon kii pahchaan ke liye enarasi kii jo suchi taiyaar kii gai he, uski kamiyon ko dur karne ke liye kai staron par vikalp bhi diye gaye hai
 Unfortunately, parties like Congress and RJD have not been able to rise above political interest on the issue of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and NRC in Assam

 He does not care whether he is interested in sex or not, which is wrong
 yahi vajah he ki purushon ko chahie ki sex karne se pehle partner kii ichha ko jaane or phir sex kii pahal karen
 Remember that the things we find fun repeat
 saath hi jin chizon ko ham neeras tareeke se karte hai, usase hamaara man jaldi ub jaataa he
 More or less the same principle fits into sexual life as well
 yahi vajah he ki pranay sambandh bana rahe jodo ko chahie ki ve ek-duusare kii bhaawanaaon kaa puraa-puraa khyal rakhen
 Only then the car of life will be able to run with speed

 Both love and career are very different from each other
 jab insaan pyaar main hota he to partner kii khushi se zyada use kuch nahin acha lagata
 Many times this love remains as long as there is no demand for commitment in it
 lekin jaise hi pyaar ke rishte ko aage badhaane kii baat hoti he to kai baar kariyar kaa pishan aage aa jaataa he
 This is not just with boys, in this case girls are also becoming vocal
 haal main bollywood kii sabase hot or luving jodi deepika padukon or ranbir singh kebich bhi daraar padanejaisi khabaren aa rahi hai
 According to the news, Deepika is focusing more on her career and due to this she is not ready to give any commitment to Ranbir
 aisa hi kuch tab hua tha jayeenushka sharma ne viraat kohlike shaadi ke prapojal ko apane kariyar ke liye na kah diya tha
 This is not just happening in the middle of a celebrity couple
 ye baat normal life main bhi dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Where girls do not want to be involved in important turning points like marriage and commitment at the peak of career
 aaie jaane, kyon kamitment kii maang par tut jate hai zyaadaatar rishte
 
 
 1
 ladkiyaan apane kariyar ko shaadi se zyada emportent maanane lagi hai or isi vajah se vah jaldi kamitment karne ko raji nahin hoti hai
 2
 aazaadee kise pyaari nahin hoti
 There is also a reason that independent girls are not able to tolerate much interference in their lives
 3
 There is no significant change in the life of boys after marriage, but girls have a lot of responsibilities
 is vajah se bhi kai ladkiyaan jaldishadi or kamitmentmen padane se bachati hai
 4
 pehle jahaan log ladki kii umr ke hisaab se shaadi karnaa sahi samajhate the
 At the same time, in today's age, age is considered simply a game of numbers
 isliye badhati umr bhi ladakiyon ko apane sapane puure karne se roak nahin paati
 5
 aajkal ladkiyaan shaadi karne se zyada jaruri apni pahchaan bananaa samajhati hai
 So when such a thing comes to the fore, they choose their careers before Vorishte

 In this regard, Karthik Prajapati and his wife Kaushalya Prajapati, who are engaged in the construction of the idol in Dangania, say that para, paddy, husk, ashhad, wood have to be purchased at double the price this year

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday condemned the 2014-15 budget of the central government, saying that the Narendra Modi-led government has been reduced to 'FDI, FDI and FDI'
 darasal, modi sarkaar ne apane pehle bajet main beemaa kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) ko maujuuda 26 fisadi se badhaakar 49 fisadi karne kaa faisla liya he, jabaki raksha kshetra main bhi epadiai ko 26 se badhaakar 49 fisadi kiya gaya he
 Mamta has written on her Facebook page, 'we had heard about a strong and vibrant India before this government came to power
 ham sochate the ki yah sushasan muhaiyaa karaayegi
 "he has written further," but we are disappointed since the beginning
 do bajaton main nai sarkaar kaa keval ek hi sakaaratmak sanket he ki vah epadiai kii, epadiai ke dwaara or epadiai ke liye sarkaar he
 'they have said,' FDI is already in retail
 ab raksha or beemaa kshetron main epadiai ko 49 fisadi kiya ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, 49 percent disinvestment will be done in banking sector
 in sabhi kaa desh kii janata par vipareet asar padegaa
 Mamta has said that the allocation of just Rs 100 crore for 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' scheme is nothing but a joke
 unhone sawaal uthaaya he, 'hamaare rajya main 'kanyashri' yojana pehali baar 1000 karod rupee ke praavdhaan se shuru kiya gaya
 It is indeed sad that important schemes like 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' of girls have been announced for all states and union territories starting from just Rs 100 crore
 'mamata ne 200 karod rupee ke aavanton se chah nae textile cluster main pashchim bengal ko hissedari nahin dene kii bhi aalochana kii he
 He has said, “despite the immense potential of textile sector in West Bengal, it has not been given a place in six new clusters
 ' trinmul congress pramukh ne kaha he, 'pashchim bengal desh main fal-sabji kaa sabase bada utpaadak hone ke baavjood bajet main ghoshit bagwani vishvavidhyalay iske hisse main nahin aayaa, yah dukhad he
 The Chief Minister has said, "not even a single penny has been raised for the 100 day employment scheme for the poor
 duusari taraf petrol, dijal or kiraasana ke saath hi fal-subjiyon ke daam rojaanaa badhate ja rahe hai
 'they have said that the new government is on the path of' political hatred '
 isaki niyat thik nahin he, shaayad isliye iske bajet main koi drushti nahin he
 Every year thousands of villages of the state are hit by disaster in Uttarakhand and it is very difficult to do relief and rescue work in the areas affected by the disaster, in such a situation how to work in the disaster affected areas, the state's SDRF The soldiers are being given 20 days training in different phases
 jisase jawan aapadaa ke vakt har chunauti se paar paane main sakasham ho saken
 Not only this, in the coming days, Adventure Guide Welfare Society is exploring new options to attract tourists as well as a plan to give this training opportunity to the general public
 uttarakhand main chardhaam yatra or kailash maansarovar yatra bhi bahut ahm he
 These trips are also a very important means of tourism and economy of the state
 chardhaam yatra mausam ke lihaaj se behad hi savedansheel maani jaati he
 The kind of disaster that rocked the entire country in Kedarnath in the year 2013, after this incident, as rain and flood became a part of Uttarakhand's life, but now SDRF is being trained to deal with these tough challenges
 
 haldwani ke amritpur main aapadaa prabandhan kii site par is samayuttarakhand sarkaradwara 20 din kaa esadiaref kaa course karavaaya ja rahaa he jisamen esadiaref ke kareeb 25 jawan training le rahe hai
 Since the Kedarnath disaster in the state, SDRF was formed to deal with this disaster
 andiaref se basic training lene ke baad ab esadiaref ke javaanon ko uttarakhand kii bhugolic sthiti ke hisaab se training di ja rahi he taaki ve aapadaa ke alaava bheeshan agnikand main bachaav kaary karne ke saath hi salbhar graminon ko bhi bachaav ke gur sikhaa saken
 These jawans are being prepared to deal with odd situations at the time of disaster, so that more people can be saved at the time of disaster and loss of life and property is minimized
 iske saath hi inhen kai tareekon setrainingdi ja rahi he ki ye apni tainaati vaali jagah par graminon ko isaki training dene ke saath hi unhen jaagruk bhi karen
 So far this training institution has given this training to more than 2200 soldiers and officers of many departments through 67 courses
 training ke gur sikhaa rahe deepak ke mutabik kahin par bhi aapadaa ke samay main kam se kam samay main aapadaa grast ilaakon main pahunch jane ke baad prabhavit logon ko praathmik chikitsa dene ke baad sahi jagah par laakar aspataal tak pahunchaana he
 According to him, the effort is that one person trains 20 people to deal with the disaster and he promotes 20 people in the next 20 years so that everyone in Uttarakhand, from a child to an elderly, has information about dealing with the disaster
 deepak ke mutabik janvari maah tak is training ko aam janata ke liye kholane kii yojana ko antim rup diya ja rahaa he jisase aam janata bhi aapadaa se nipatane kii taiyaari rakh sake, saath hi haldwani or najadik ke ilaakon main paryatakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye vikalp bana rahi he
 The soldiers taking training here have to come down and climb from the mountains to save the people during the disaster and the patient or injured also have to be tied up and brought up, so they must be trained to save the people by crossing the river
 Has been training le rahe jawan ke mutabik ve pehle 45 din kaa basic course kar chuke hai or ab yahaan or 20 din kaa rescue or search kaa course karne ke liye aae hai
 According to him, many new things have been learned here such as river crossing and mountain climbing, which will be beneficial in the coming days in areas where they will be deployed in times of disaster
 baharhaal uttarakhand main aapadaa se nipatane ke liye taiyaar ho rahi esadiaref kii team aapadaa ke samay jahaan raahat or bachaav kaary to karegi hi iske saath hi aapadaa se prabhavit kshetron main jan jaagarukta abhiyaan ke tahat graminon ko bhi aapadaa ke gur sikhaaengi taaki aapadaa ke samay peediton ko turant raahat graminon ke madhyam se mil sake
 Director Naresh Khanna, who directed several Garhwali and Punjabi films, has passed away
 ek kalakar kii jubaani jaane is mahaan nirdeshak ke vyaktitv ke bare main
 When i looked at his Facebook to see his date of birth, i found that Friend Request Sent is showing on his timeline
 ravivaar kaa puraa drishy meri aankhon ke saamne gum gaya
 Around 11 o'clock when Rakesh Gaur ji made Naresh Khanna ji sit in his car from Neelam Chowk Azraunda Metro Station
 main, brijmohan sharmaji, sonu bhai car main pehle hi maujuud the
 This was my first and last meeting with Naresh Khanna
 mulaakaat ke baad shaam ko ghar aakar hi to maine unhen friend request bheji thi
 Yesterday he had a heart attack on the train going from Delhi to Dehradun
 sidhe unhen dilli ke akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan laayaa gaya lekin tab tab unki maut ho chuki thi
 His family is in Mumbai so his body was taken to Mumbai by plane
 unhone gadhwali main 'bantwaaru', 'chakrachaal' or 'subero ghaam' or 'bhuli i bhuli' sahit kai punjabi filmon kaa nirdesan kiya
 'chakrachal' was his hit and popular film
 aajkal ve haalia relies gadhwali film 'bhuli i bhuli' ke pramotion main jute the
 On Sunday (7 August), the film 'bhuli Ai Bhuli' was screened at the Faridabad Neelam Theater
 pehla sho tha isliye gadhwal sabha faridabad ke kai log naresh khannaji kii agavaani main lage the
 We watched the film together in Neelam Cinema
 upsanhaar main maine unase kaha sar aapane film main khanan mafia vishay par acha prahaar kiya
 News of newspapers and channels does not louse the ears of the government, but your film will work for public awakening
 phir cinema gharon kii dasha or uttarakhandee film industry kii dasha-disha par bhi sankshipt baatcheet hui
 In the first small meeting i found that this person is not exactly what i was thinking
 pichley saal dilli ke surabhi studio main 'bhuli i bhuli' kii casting ho rahi thi
 a friend of mine told me that you too come with Naresh Khanna ji and he needs Garhwali artists
 maine sochaa itnaa bada nirdeshak he to pataa nahin kya soche or mumbai se aayaa he
 So even thinking that i did not go
 aaj main jhootha sabit ho rahaa tha or apane aap par afsos kar rahaa tha
 i wish i had gone to Surabhi Studios that day, i would have been a part of the film 'bhuli Ai Bhuli' today
 pehali hi mulaakaat main ve kaaphi ghul mil gaye
 He also assured me to work together before i saw him in a film
 lekin mujhe kya pataa tha ve apane is bharose ko khud hi tod denge
 This first meeting will prove to be the last meeting and will leave a constriction in the heart forever
 arvind kejariwal apni maansik sthirataa kho chuke hai
 This is to say that Manoj Tiwari, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Delhi unit
 manoj tiwari kaa bayaan us baat par aayaa jab unase yah poocha gaya ki arvind kejariwal ne kaha he ki yadi dilli main NRC lagu hua, to sabase pehle aap jaaenge
 In response to this, Manoj Tiwari said, "I would like to ask if the person who comes from Purvanchal is an illegal intruder whom he wants to chase from Delhi
 
 
 "manoj tiwari ne kaha, "jo log anya rajyon se dilli main aakar based hai, unhen aap videshi maan rahe hai
 
 
 The If you want to drive them out of Delhi, then you are one of them
 
 
 agar yah unka iraadaa he, to mujhe lagata he, vah apni maansik sthirataa kho chuke hai
 
 
 How does an IRS officer not know what an NRC is
 
 
 ?"isse pehle dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne dilli main kiraye par rahane vaale logon ke liye ek mahatvapurn yojana kaa elaan kiya
 When the Chief Minister started going out of his press conference, at that time he was questioned by the media person about NRC, in response to which Arvind Kejriwal said that if NRC is implemented in Delhi, Manoj Tiwari will go first
 bataa den, tiwari ne ateet main kai maukon par yah maang kii he ki assam kii tarah dilli main bhi enarasi ko lagu kiya janaa chahie
 Last month, Tiwari said that the situation in Delhi has become 'dangerous' due to the presence of a large number of illegal migrants including Bangladeshi and Rohingya as they have been found involved in criminal activities
 aam aadmi party ke mukhiya or dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal ne madhya pradesh ke bhind main iviem ke saath chhedchhad par rashtriya chunaav ayog par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Kejriwal has demanded to make the data associated with the software of evms public, saying that if the Election Commission does not have the technology to decode the data, then the experts of Aam Aadmi Party can do it in 72 hours
 voting mashiinon kii karai jaae jaanchasomvaar ko ek press conference ke dauraankejariwal nekaha, 'madhya pradesh main ek aisi EVM saamne ai he, jisamen koi bhi batan dabaane par bijepi ko vot ja rahaa he
 It has also been heard that a total of 300 machines, including that machine, have been called from Govindnagar in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, for the by-election in Madhya Pradesh
 in mashiinon main kya khaas tha jo niyam-kanoon ko todate hue ye vishesh EVM hi madhya pradesh bheji gayi hai? aam aadmi party chunaav ayog se maang karti he ki aisi mashiinon kii jaanch karai jaae or sachai janata ke samaksh rakhi jaae
 Citing Kejriwal's accusations on the Election Commission, Kejriwal put the Election Commission itself in the circle of questions
 unhone kaha, 'haal hi main saamne aayaa ki madhya pradesh ke bhind main hone vaale upachunaav main istemaal hone vaali EVM main koi bhi batan dabaane par vivipat mashin se bijepi ke chunaav chinh kii parchi nikal rahi thi

 Not long ago, there was a verbal war between the SP, JDU and RJD to describe themselves as real socialists
 tab har kisi ne khud ko duusare se behatar bataaya tha

 kahin nahin, to kam se kam bagpat main to aisa hi he

 Akshay Kumar is an extremely promising actor
 akshay apni filmon ke liye kadi mehnat karte hai
 His hard work is clearly visible
 akshay kumaar aksar nae diarectors ke saath kaam karte hai
 Now the actor has revealed the reason behind it
 nae diarectors ke saath kaam kyon karte hai akshay?apakaming film good news ke trailor launch main akshay kumaar ne bataaya- main nae diarectors ke saath isliye kaam karata hum kyonki bade diarectors mujhe apni filmon main cast hi nahin karte hai
 He said that when older people do not take you, then you have to start your journey yourself
 jab bade publication main aapako job nahin milti to aap chote publication kii taraf jate hai
 From there you jump
 ye sochate hue ki log aapako kyon nahin le rahe hai aap ghar par khaali nahin baith sakate, jabaki aap itane sakasham hai
 When Akshay was asked that there was a time when the big directors were working with only Khan
 is par akshay ne kaha- bade diarectors unheen ke paas jate hai jo diserv karte hai
 You can see that it is not only Khan, Kapuras End and many others
 maine sochaa ki main diserv nahin karata isliye maine apane tareeke se kamanaa shuru kar diya
 Akshay further said- No big director is still working with me
 wo mere saath film produs kar rahe hai lekin meri film diarect nahin kar rahe hai
 You can ask Karan Johar, Aditya Chopra
 nae diarectors ke saath kaam karne parakshayne kaha- film good news ke diarector raaj mehta mere 21wein nae diarector hai
 i also think that their greed to do good work is more than the old directors
 kyonki unke liye, ye ek karo yaa maro kii sthiti hoti he, kyonki unhen lagata he yadi film nahin chali to ve khatm ho jaaenge

 But he himself is not telling the name of his mentors by being accused
 emdi yani mefedrone drug ko myou-myou naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Recently banned under the NDPS Act, this drug has been holding youth in a big way in Mumbai
 mumbai police ke hi ek hawaldaar ke pakade jane or phir custom or ipies afasar kaa naam uchhalane se ye maamla or bhi pechida ho gaya he

 This time the BJP has made a strategy to leave the entire responsibility to the mps for the MCD elections in Delhi
 dilli main saaton saansad bijepi ke hai or emsidi chunaav bhi party sansadeey kshetra ke aadhaar par hi lard rahi he
 This is the reason why the party has made it necessary for mps to be present in every small and big activity related to MCD elections
 saansadon kii jaankaree ke bagaiyr emsidi chunaav se judaa koi bhi kaam party main nahin ho rahaa he
 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari is one of the seven mps and he says that mps keep a close eye on their constituency
 aise main unki bhoomika to mahatvapurn honi hi chahie
 After winning all the mps and Maharashtra civic elections in the party to win the MCD, the party has given all the mps the responsibility of winning the MCD elections in Delhi
 unhen hi vijayrath ko na rukne dene ke liye sarathi banaaya he
 Significantly, the BJP has divided the entire Delhi according to the areas of seven mps instead of three mcds
 har saansad ko apane-apane ilaake kaa incharge banaaya he or ab saare kaamkaaj main saansadon kii raay jaruri bana di gai he
 For example, from the responsibility of booth management workers to layoffs of ticket claimants and even to decide candidates for the wards in their respective areas for the ticket, mps have also been entrusted with the responsibility
 matlab saaf he ki apane sansadeey kshetra main saansadon ke pasand ko hi tarjeeh di jaaegi
 According to party sources, the tickets of the current councilors have been cut to give free hands to the mps, so that the mps can get freedom to choose candidates in their respective areas
 bijepi saansad pravesh verma ke mutabik is baar party kii ranneeti jeetne kii he or isi ke aadhaar par saare faisle kiye ja rahe hai
 This strategy of the party is likely to be reflected in the workers' conference on Saturday at Ramlila Maidan

 This will also reveal the number of activists from every mp's constituency

 In such a situation, they are moving ahead on the strategy of winning the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from the MCD election
