 china ne 9 june kii shanghai kooparation orgenigeshan (essio) shikhar baithak ke liye aupniveshik daur kii imaaraton or sundar baag-bagichon vaale tateey shahar chingdao ko isliye chunaa tha kyonki yah shi jinping ke belt and road initiative (biarai) kaa mukhya padaav he
 Eurasia is the heart of the BRI, so Xi was preparing an atmosphere to step up his effort by hosting a splendid SCO security group
 rus or china samarthit chingdao shikhar sammelan kaa yah pehla aisa mauka tha jisamen bharat ne purna sadsy ke rup main shirkat kii
 India and Pakistan were formally included in the six-member group that includes China and Russia, besides Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke liye yahaan kootnithik santulan sthapit karnaa jatil tha kyonki unhen yahaan biarai par bharat kii asahmati darj karaate hue, is kshetra ke liye bharat ke drushtikon ko bhi rakhana tha
 The Prime Minister also appeared successful in this
 essio ke mejabaan shi ke shuruaati bhaashan ke thik baad modi ko bharat kaa drushtikon prastut karne ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya
 In his speech, Modi had a vision of India to increase traffic and connectivity, but he was completely different from China
 shi kii maujuudagi main modi ne kaha, ''essio or padosiyon ke saath avaagaman or sampark ko behatar karnaa bharat kii praathamiktaaon main shaamil he
 "but he made it clear that India would welcome such new projects to improve connectivity that are inclusive, sustainable, transparent, and in which there is full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations
" ''bharat ne isse pehle bhi kai baar biarai main paardarshita kii kami or paak adhikrut kashmir se hokar jane vaale china-pakistan iconomic coridor (sipiisi) ko lekar apni chintaaen jaahir kii hai
 India strongly supported the 17-page Qingdao Declaration issued at the SCO
 biarai par kendrit ek paragraph main sabhi essio 'sadsy deshon' ke sthaan par, essio ke chah sadasyon—rus, pakistan, kazakhstan, kirgogistan, uzbekistan or tajikistan kii sahmati kii baat likhi gai he
 However the term SCO 'member country' was used elsewhere in this document
 is prakaar bharat ne china kii aguai vaali biarai pariyojna par apni sthiti spasht kar di ki vah iske paksh main nahin he
 At the same time, China succeeded in referring to the BRI in the manifesto, which an official calls a practical agreement
 china main bharat ke purv rajdoot or institute for chinis studies, dilli ke nideshak ashok kanth kehete hai, ''hamane kshetreey sampark kii disha main badhibia samarthan jataayaa
 "kantha says that it is now being understood that India and China seem to be full of agreement for each other instead of the differences they had before
" chingdao main modi or shi ke bich ek ghante tak chali dwipaksheeya baithak donon ne 'sakaaratmak moolyankan' kiya or isse kuch aisa hi sandesh nikalakar aayaa
 Relations between the two countries have improved since the 'informal summit' held in Wuhan on 28 April
 'vuhaan sahamat' ko aage le jate hue donon deshon ne aane vaale varshon main sambandhon ko pragadh karne kii disha main videsh mantriyon, raksha mantriyon, rashtriya suraksha salaahkaaron ke bich baithkon tathaa aagaamee maheenon main donon deshon ke grih mantriyon ke bich baithak kii pushti karte hue mahatvakankshi blueprint jari kiya he
 For the first time, the two countries will work together in a third country and under this a project of 'capacity building' in Afghanistan will be announced soon
 donon deshon ne brahmaputra ke jal se jude aankade saajha karne—china ne pichley saal ise band kar diya tha—or china ko gaiyr-basmati chaaval kaa niryaat badhaane ke dwipaksheeya samjhauta patr par hastakshar kiye
 Xi said he would happily accept Prime Minister Modi's invitation for the second 'informal' summit to be held in India which is expected to be held in early 2019
 unhone kaha ki vuhaan ne 'ek nae aagaaj' ke dwaar khole hai
 Of course there have been many new beginnings in the ups and downs in india-china relations

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter thailand kii purv pradhanmantri yinglak ke court nahin pahunchane kii nazhal se supreme court ne giraftaar kaa warrant jari kiya gaya hai
 Former Thailand Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra did not appear in court on Friday for a case of negligence as he could be sentenced to jail in the case, following which the Supreme Court today issued an arrest warrant in view of his fear of fleeing his country
 Released and the junta increased control of the border
 haalanki hajaaron samarthak shuukravaar ko thailand kii pehali mahila pradhanmantri yinglak kii ek jhaalak paane ke liye intjaar kar rahe the, lekin vah dikhaai nahin di thi
 After this, there were fears that she had not gone to her billionaire brother Thaksin, who was in self-exile
 mukhya nyaayadhish chip chulamon ne is maamle kii sunwaayee kii agali taarikh 27 sitambar tay karte hue ashanka bhi jataai ki vah desh chhodkar ja sakati hai
 He said, his advocate has said that he is ill and asked to delay the decision
 haalanki adaalat ko is baat par yakeen nahin he ki vah biimaar hai or unke khilaaf warrant jari karne kaa nirnay diya
 It is noteworthy that Yingluck's government was ousted in 2014 through a military coup
 yadi unhen chaaval sabsidi niti main laaparvaahee ke maamle main doshi tehraaya jaataa he, to unhen 10 saal kii jail or raajnneeti se jivan bhar ke liye pratibandhit kiya ja saktaa hai
 Former prime minister advocate Norwait Larleng told reporters outside the court that i had told the court at eight in the morning that he was suffering from Meniere's disease and was dizzy, so he appealed to the court to postpone the hearing
 
 reporter ke adhivaktaa se puche jane par ki kya yinglak thailand main hi hai tab janaab main unhone kaha ki mujhe pataa nahin hai
 Please tell that Yingluck's brother Thaksin Shinawatra is also the former Prime Minister of Thailand, who left the country in 2008 after being convicted of corruption and sentenced to two years imprisonment
 uske baad se vah waapas nahin laute
 His Thailand passport has also been revoked

 Both videos are seen from the same place
 ek video din kaa he, vahiin doosraa video shaam kaa dikh rahaa he
 India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) investigated both the videos and found that the claim of rigging with evms is false

 video main ek aadmi iviem le jane vaale logon se sawaljawab karte hue sunai de rahaa he
 After listening to the entire conversation of the video, it seems that the man is suspected of tampering with EVM
 video main ek jagah ye shaks poochta hua sunai de rahaa he ki ye iviem kahaan se aa rahi hai
 In response, a man carrying an EVM is saying that this EVM is reserved and Sakaldiha is being transported
 video main bhi ek jagah diwaar par "reserve strang room sakaldiha" likhaa hua nazar aa rahaa he
 Sakaldiha is an assembly seat in Uttar Pradesh, which is about ten kilometers from Chandauli
 chandauli main 19 may ko chunaav hue the
 The video has been shared by a Twitter user named Ravi Nair who has been retweeted almost 7000 times
 is bare main hamaari baat chandauli ke dm navaneet chahal se hui
 They told us that these are reserved evms that are used when a technical fault occurs
 unka kahana tha ki ye reserved iviem sakaldiha se chandauli ke naveen mandi sthit reserve strang room main rakhi ja rahi thim
 These evms were brought here the next day after the election
 ravi nair ne is twit ke saath chunaav ayog kaa ek dastavej bhi joda he
 a rule in this letter clearly states that while the evms used for casting votes will be deposited in the strong room, at the same time the reserved evms must also be submitted to the reserved strong room
 is bare main dm kaa kahana tha ki aisa samay kii kami ke kaaran hua
 Here is the EC guidelines for the storage and transportation of reserved evms during and immediately after the election

 This was the month when Uttarakhand was about to face a disaster, which it had no idea of

 In fact, Uttarakhand is like a rainy year every year

 Beautiful courts of Uttarakhand have been struggling with this problem for centuries

 People started reading forcefully on the forehead, looking for the situation to be normal
 abhi bhi barish ke halaaton se uttarakhand puri tarah batch nahin paaya he
 Due to heavy rains across North India, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand created floods and landslides
 isse prabhavit anya rajya haryana, dilli or uttar pradesh hai
 The floods caused heavy loss of life and property and many people were swept away by floods and thousands of people became homeless

 unhone kaha ki yah bataur salaahkaar 1999 se 2002 tak unke kaam kii evaj main die gaye the
 Conflict of interest case: The FIFA court dismissed the corruption charges against the two but found them guilty of conflict of interest
 adaalat ne kaha, 'na to likhit bayaan main or na hi sunwaayee ke dauraan blator is bhugtan kaa koi vaidhanik aadhaar bataa sake
 The court said that Platini failed to act with credibility and morality and was careless about the omission of his duty
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne apane nav varsh ke sandesh main sambhavat: kathin daur se guzar rahi apni sarkaar or congress kii ‘kamiyon or galatiyon’ par chintan karte hue aaj ‘sudharatmak kaary’ kii ‘‘nai shuruyaat' karne kii baat kii
 Wishing peace, security, happiness and prosperity for all in the coming year 2014, Singh said, it is time to maintain hope, achieve goals, start afresh with determination and faith
 apane sandesh main unhone kaha, raashtra ke rup main yah ekajute or bhavi avasaron tathaa chunautiyon ke liye apane aapako taiyaar karne kaa samay he
 His message is seen in the context of facing the challenges of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections

 On Saturday morning, the sky turned blue and then suddenly it was dark
 samudr or akaash ke sandhi bindu par ek shunya pasar gaya jisamen dub gaye pani se bhare kitne hi badal
 Neelabh Mishra breathed his last at Apollo Hospital in Chennai at 7
30 am and went on a journey
 chup rahanaa nilabh kaa swabhaav tha
 He was never making noise like the shore
 atal sagar jaise shant the or shaayad isiilie unhen samudr bahut aakarshith karata tha
 When in the beginning of February it was found out that Neelabh was going to Chennai, since then a doubt had gone home
 tinkaa tinke se mila, tin kaa tin ke paas
 Then when i went to see him before this departure, it was clear that only miracles can bring him back
 lekin nilabh chamatkaar se jeet gaye
 Neelabh did not have to go so fast
 ham sabhi aisa hi maanate hai
 But live as much as Neelabh, live it
 bharpoor jivan se bharaa-puraa jivan
 He remembers that it is more important than going to live and living what he says, it teaches the life of Neelabh
 chal-kapat se rahit, aadambaron or bhrashtachar se mukt, insaaniyat, bhaichaare main yakeen ko jite hue, jan-pakshadharata ke liye bebaak sawaal uthaate or ladate hue, apane andar ke patrkaar ko bakhubi nibhaate hue, prem or aadar ko jivan kaa rasta banaae nilabh jie
 Speaking less, listening more, always taking care of language and spontaneity while speaking, getting peace from the voice away from the charge was the hallmark of Neelabh
 nilabh se pehali mulaakaat jaipur main hui
 In the crowd of demonstrations of mass organizations, Neelabh used to see everything with his eyes like a chatka in a corner
 unke paas hona tab ham jaise nae yuva patrakaron ko urja se bhar detaa tha
 Every meeting went by teaching something
 har baar kuch nayaa drushtikon, koi nayaa pahalu, kuch nae shabd or style seekhney ko mil jate the
 Slowly speaking, a heavy body felt like a mango carcass that had both shade and fruit
 phir wo dilli aa gaye
 Here he started working in Outlook Hindi
 pehle anandalok or phir shahpur jat main unka nivas rahaa
 It was here that i came to live with Arvind Kejriwal with the decision to return to mainstream journalism after my disillusionment with him
 na kabhi nilabh se maine naukari maangi, na kabhi unhone di
 It was probably an undisclosed agreement between us
 unke saath kaam karnaa or unke liye kaam karnaa vaali sthiti ke bich ham apane apane sansthaanon kii zimmedaari nibhaate rahe
 It was also publicized many times about Neelabh and me that this is Neelabh's younger brother
 beshak, ham ghar ke hi the
 Ganga's home is both
 main bhi ganga kinare paidaa hua or wo bhi
 So whether my Ganges was in Awadh and their Magadha
 thi to ganga hi
 For many years Neelabh used to laugh at me by telling me that such a person was saying that i am your brother
 main garv se kahata tha, jhooth kya kah rahaa he vah
 When Nilabh reached Chennai for dah, he also took ab-e-jamjam and Gangajal in his vial
 nilabh ke dah se pehle unke haq kii ganga se unhen milwa diya
 i have brought the rest with some bones
 gadhmukteshwar main ganga kinare unki or meri sabase priy dukaan par kaddu-puri khaakar unhen ganga kii god main khilne ko chhod aaunga
 The steps of the affinity of both of us were food, Hindi language, journalism, music, literature, art-culture, cinema and public concerns
 bhojan sabase pehle likhaa he
 Because this was also the most important
 donon ko bhojan ke suswaadu or suruchipurna hone kii zid thi
 Both could talk for hours on food, could eat at any time, and could tell something right on any type of food
 bhojan kii saamaajik prishthbhumi or raajnneeti se lekar uske prakaar, pravriti or pakaane par hamaara vishesh dhyaan rahata
 He used to bring Misti Doi from Annapurna, i used to cook Jagannathi Dalma at home
 bhaat, raita or kalaunjee ke saath apane daur chalate the
 The same thing has been eaten since Saturday
 bhojan kaa premi vyakti teen saptaah tak tarah-tarah kii davaaiyaan grahan karata rasayanon se bharaa sharir ban gaya
 
 
 i wish i could get up once before going to Neelabh and i would be able to make everything i liked and feed them
 nilabh ko kabhi naaraaz nahin dekha
 He was in no hurry
 na adheeratha, na akulata
 Calm like the ocean
 ankhen bacchon jaisi chapaltaa se bhari, haath hameshaa pitrutv kaa ahsaas dilaate hue
 Such that there is no need to worry
 ghanton ham logon kii bhadaas sunne ke baad dhire se budbudakar shant karnaa unka sahaj vyavhaar tha
 One thing that stood out among all this was work
 kaam samay par or sahi dhang se
 From how to see the news, how to open, how to write, he was even stricter than Dronacharya on the language, impact and formation of the news
 anuwaad aisa ki lage hindi main hi to likhaa gaya tha, baad main angrezi kiya gaya hoga
 And the superiority of the news over the person
 aaj is baat ko kehane main hichak nahin he ki kitne hi sansthaanon main kaam karte hue unke liye likhata rahaa or wo tarah-tarah ke naamon se use chhapate rahe
 Neelabh taught one thing again and again
 khabar kii pradhanta
 Do not stop him nor let anyone stop you
 roktaa he to lado
 If you cannot print, then give it to others
 naam chapana unke mutabik goud tha
 He used to say that it is for deciding responsibility
 baaki mul baat khabar he
 It should be printed
 mere tumhaare yahaan nahin to kisi or jagah sahi
 Neelabh was among the rare people who used their politics and consciousness to research the news
 na ki use prabhavit karne or badalane ke liye
 He was among the people engaged in karma by keeping himself detached
 nilabh wo vyakti hai jinhone mujhe sabase pehle mozart or bithovan se milwaaya
 Kumar Gandharva and Subbalakshmi were dear to both of us
 falon main aam, rason main ganna, khaane main meetha or peya main chaay nilabh ko parampriy the
 Very few people know that cold was also their favorite drink and that is why we used to freeze when given the opportunity
 yah mithaas jeevanabhar unke vyaktitv main rahi

 Lalu is cursing the hour when he was caught in the fodder scam
 or isiilie ab har kadam phoonk-fook kar rakh rahe hai
 His flight from Patna was in the afternoon
 lekin kisi ne kah diya ki subah 11 baje se pehle hi ghar se nikal jaaiega
 He agreed and left
 17 saal se ek ghotaale ke daag or kanoonee shikanje ne lalu ke siyaasi kariyar ko utaar-chadhaav ke kai hichkole khilaae hai
 But till date the law was in force till date
 aaj tamaam bahes or jirah ke baad faisle kaa din he
 How to avoid this legal trap? After all, how to get the decision in your favor? There will be some way to avoid this biggest political crisis
 jaisaa aam logon ke man main aata he, lalu ke man main bhi vaise hi sawaal or vichaar umad-ghumad rahe honge
 It is said that Lalu is already a believer in witchcraft
 or jab sir par itani badi musiibat aa padi ho, tab to kuch bhi karne ko taiyaar hai lalu ji
 It has been reported that someone had advised Lalu that he should leave for Ranchi on Sunday before 11 am
 uske baad kaa muhoort kharaab ho jaataa he
 Lalu also tied things up
 subah saadhe das baje hi lalu patna ke ghar se baahar aa gaye

 Boycott said that the Indian team is going through a phase of change and according to him some star Indian cricketers have gone through their top level
 unhone ‘da daily telegraph’ main apane kollam main likhaa, ‘bhartiya team utani taqatvar nahin he, jaisi vah hua karti thi
 His two great batsmen VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid have retired, while Sachin Tendulkar is no longer as great as he used to be
 ’boycott ne kaha, ‘harbhajan singh or jahir khan achche gendbaaj rahe hai, lekin ve apane sarvshereshth str se guzar chuke hai
 You can say that visiting India has become a little easier now because hotels are better, English food in big cities is fantastic and travel has become easier
 ’unki yah pratikriya england ke test shrinkhalaa main bharat ko uski sarajameen par 2-1 se haraakar 28 saal kaa myth todane ke baad aayi he
 Boycott, a cricketer-turned-commentator, praised the team led by Alastair Cook who bounced back after a crushing defeat in the opening match of the series
 boycott ne kaha, ‘is saal ke shuru main hamane pakistan ke khilaaf teen test or srilanka ke khilaaf ek test ganvaa diya
 We played very poorly in the first Test in Ahmedabad and lost
 achaanak bharat main sabhi ko laga ki england kii team 0-4 se haar jaayegi
 'he said,' He deserves praise for showing such passion, determination and ability
 ’boycott ne kaha, ‘england ne andrew strans ke sanyas ke baad ab nayaa salaami ballebaaj khoj liya he
 He also praised the spin duo of Cook, Kevin Pietersen, fast bowler James Anderson and Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar
 boycott ne kaha, ‘england ne yah shrinkhalaa teen bade gendbaajon james anderson, greem swaan or monti panesar kii badaulat jiti
 'he said,' Alastair Cook, Kevin Pietersen and Anderson were great

 ’ Usman is now caught alive after Kasab, who was responsible for the Mumbai attack
 haalanki abhi is par vivaad chal rahaa he ki aakhir is aatanki ko jinda kisne pakadaa
 Security forces or villagers? If the eyewitnesses and the abducted people believe that the credit of capturing the terrorist Usman lives goes to the villagers, but if the claims of the army, BSF and police, they have caught the terrorist
 in daavon kii padtaal ke liye puri ghatana par najar daalana jaruri he
 a BSF bus, about 15 km from Udhampur, was attacked by two terrorists in the morning
 hamale main biguef ke do jawan shahid ho gaye or kareeb das ghayal ho gaye
 One terrorist was killed in retaliation while another escaped from there
 isi bhaage hue aatanki ne baad main teen graminon ko pakadaa or unhen baahar kaa rasta dikhaane ko kaha
 The villagers are telling that they have caught this terrorist
 jaahir he, police or surakshakarmiyon ko bhi unki talash rahi hogi or unki koshish kii vajah se vah nikal nahin paaya hoga, lekin sabase pehle use nihattha karke jakadane kaa shrey aam gaanv waalon se chhinana thik nahin hoga
 Now the news is coming that this terrorist is from Ghulam Mustafabad village of Faisalabad
 san 2008 main mumbai main hamalaa karne vaale ajmal kasaab ke baad pehali baar koi aatanki jinda haath aayaa he
 There is no doubt that the terrorist's capture alive is a huge success for the Indian security forces
 is aatanki ko pakadaney main gram suraksha samiti ke sadsy vikramjit or rakesh kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 Keep in mind that when a terrorist comes to die, he directly means that he is a suicide bomber and he does not care about his life
 iske baavjood bahadur graminon ne prashikshit or gorilla hamale main maahir aatanki ko dhardabocha
 The comments duusari taraf sena daawa kar rahi he ki uske special forcej ke javaanon ne na keval ek aatanki ko maar giraaya balki duusare aatanki ko jinda bhi pakadaa
 The BSF and the police are also making similar claims
 is sawaal kaa jawaab koi nahin de rahaa ki udhampur jaise sena ke nardan cmand ke headqwater ke paas aatanki suraksha gheraa tod paane main kaise kamayab ho gaye? Despite these claims, now that India has caught a terrorist alive, it will open many such secrets in front of the security forces, which will further strengthen the claims of hatching conspiracy in Pakistan's land
 iske saath hi bharat ke is daawey ko takat milegi ki pakistan kii jameen par bharat ke khilaaf aatanki hamale kii sajishein rachi jaati hai
 This terrorist will also know which terrorist organization he is a member of, what is the attitude of the government of Pakistan behind these attacks
 aatanki seemaa ke kis raste se aane main kaamyaab hote hai or kab hote hai
 It is necessary to look at the entire incident to investigate these claims
 udhampur se kareeb 15 kilometre dur biguef kii ek bas par subah do aatankiyon ne hamalaa kiya
 Two BSF personnel were killed and around ten injured in the attack
 javaabi karrwai main ek aatanki maaraa gaya jabaki doosraa vahaan se bhaag niklaa
 This fleeing terrorist later caught three villagers and asked them to show the way out
 gaanv vaale bataa rahe hai ki unhone is aatanki ko pakadaa he
 Obviously, the police and security personnel must have been looking for him and because of his efforts, he would not have been able to get out, but it would not be right to first take away the credit of unarmed by the villagers
 ab khabar aa rahi he ki yah aatanki faisalabad ke gaanv gulam mustafabad kaa rahane vaala he
 For the first time after Ajmal Kasab, who attacked Mumbai in 2008, a terrorist has come alive
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki aatanki kaa jinda pakadaa janaa bhartiya suraksha balon ke liye bahut badi kamyaabi he
 Vikramjit and Rakesh, members of the Village Security Committee, played an important role in catching this terrorist
 dhyaan rahe jab koi aatanki marane, maarane ke liye aata he to uskaa sidhaa matlab yah he ki vah fidaayin hamalavar he or use apni jaan kii parvaah nahin he
 Despite this, the brave villagers trained and specializes in the gorilla attack
 tippaniyan On the other hand, the army is claiming that the soldiers of its Special Forces not only killed one terrorist but also caught the other terrorist alive
 aisa hi daawa biguef or police bhi kar rahi he
 No one is answering the question how the terrorists have managed to break the security cordon near the Northern Command Headquarters of Army like Udhampur? baavjood in daavon ke ab jabaki bharat ne ek aatanki ko jinda pakad liya he to yah suraksha balon ke saamne kai aise raaj kholegaa, jo pakistan kii jameen main napak sajishein rachane ke daavon ko or bal denge
 With this, India's claim will be strengthened that the plot of terror attack against India on Pakistan's land is planned
 is aatanki se yah bhi pataa chalegaa ki vah kis aatanki sanghathan kaa sadsy he, pakistan kii sarkaar kaa in hamalon ke peeche kya ravaiya he
 How and when do terrorists manage to get through the border
 gaanv vaale bataa rahe hai ki unhone is aatanki ko pakadaa he

 Due to lack of support from Madhesi mps, Prachanda had to stay away from majority in the Constituent Assembly voting

 Now the court should give the verdict, on this or the other side, whichever court gives the verdict will be accepted

 But the idol was kept in the mosque, the mosque was demolished, the court has to decide on the basis of the evidence
 masjid islam kaa ek ang he
 Even after the mosque has been demolished, the namaz will be performed on the ground
 vah jagah masjid kehalaaegi
 The mosque land cannot be given or sold to anyone
 vah hameshaa masjid hi kahi jaaegi
 We believe in the court
 kanoon par vishwaas karte hai
 The court should decide
 idhar kare yaa udhar kare, kyonki iske pehle is par itani raajnneeti kii ja chuki he
 More respect to the namaz in the mosque- Haji Mahboobbari Haji Mahboob, a party of the mosque, says that the way the temple is worshiped, the namaz is offered in the mosque
 yah sahi he ki ham namaaj kahin bhi adaa kar sakate hai, lekin masjid main namaaj adaa karne se adhik sabaab miltaa he
 Therefore it is more legitimate to offer prayers in the mosque
 court de chukaa he faisla, namaaj masjid kaa ang nahin- satyendra dasramajnmabhumi ke mukhya pujari acharya satyendra das kehete hai ki iske pehle usee court main faisla ho chukaa he ki namaaj masjid kaa ang nahin hota
 Namazists who offer Namaz can perform Namaz anywhere
 yah koi jaruri nahin he ki vah masjid main hi padhe or kahin naa padhe
 Prayers are held everywhere on the streets in the mosque in the mosque
 isko puri tarah samajhakar kaha gaya tha ki namaaj masjid kaa ang nahin he
 Now, once the decision has been made, why there is a need to decide again, it will be understood only after the decision of the 27th
 lekin jo yah faisla aayega vah bataa degaa ki namaaj masjid kaa ang nahin he

 Preparations for Diwali are in full swing and the excitement of the festival is also in spate
 lekin ek dar bhi dilli ko sata rahaa he or ye he dhuen kaa
 Every year in Delhi, the amount of air pollution increases around Diwali and also reaches dangerous levels
 yahi nahin diwali ke baad mausam main aane vaale badlaav se bhi dilli main pradooshan kaa khatra or bhi badhata jaataa he
 After 2 days, there is Deepawali and on this occasion the pollution in the air will dissolve
 lekin usase pehle hi dilli kii hawaaen behad pradooshit hai
 The air level in Lodhi Road has reached a low level
 dilli ke mausam vibhaag ke baahar screen ke jariye air quality index ko darshaya ja rahaa he jisamen saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki kis tarah se yahaan kii hawa pradooshit bani hui
 PM2 here
 5 kaa str 266 tak pahunch gaya he
 This situation is when heavy commercial vehicles are banned in Lodhi Road and there is a lot of greenery here
 rajdhani main pradooshan ke khatre ko dekhte hue,dhuen vaale patakhenhin phodne or aatishbaazi ko kam karne kii apil kii ja rahi he or log bhi yahi mahasoos kar rahe hai
 To get the mood of the people, if we went out on the streets of Delhi, fear of pollution was visible in the minds of the people of Delhi, but the excitement of the festival also seems to dominate this fear sometimes
 dilli main fasebuk ke zarie safai abhiyaan kaa group chalaane vaale rajeev jain kai jagahon parasvachh bharat abhiyaanke tahat safai kar chuke hai
 People are also joining their campaign, people's engagement with Clean Delhi's mission shows that people not only want cleanliness around them, but they are also ready to contribute for clean air and clean environment
 
 lekin iske liye unamem jaagarukta laane kii zarurat he
 So this time the group is appealing to the people to celebrate the festival in such a way that the pollution is minimized and there is no loss in enthusiasm
 shahar kii sadakon paradivalike baad hone vaali gandagi ko saaf karne kaa bidaa uthaane vaale dike sharma bhi maanate hai ki tyohaar ke utsaah main log bhul jate hai ki pradooshan or gandagi unki sehat ke liye bhi thik nahin he
 It is also the responsibility of society not to let the mess spread and bring awareness among the people
 dilli main raajnneetik partiyon ko bhi andaja he ki pradooshan kitna bada mudda he, isiilie logon ko pradooshan ko kam karne kii apil kii ja rahi he
 Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay said that last year the government started the odd-even formula to eliminate pollution, but after that nothing was done to curb pollution
 ab phir diwali ai he, log jaagruk ho rahe hai or kam pradooshan faile is tarah ke tareekon se tyohaar manaane kii shuruyaat ho bhi gai he
 He said that he hopes that people will celebrate the festival this time in non-polluting ways, but the government should also have prepared in advance for the poison that dissolves in the Delhi air after Diwali
 ab diwali najadik he or pataakhon ko lekar log taiyaar bhi hai, lekin ummid yahi karte hai ki log kam se kam pataakhe jalaayenge
 This will reduce noise and air pollution, but Delhi will also have to be ready to fight the cold weather pollution after Diwali
 isaki sabase acchhee shuruyaat yahi hogi ki diwali bina dhuen vaali manaai jaae

 dhan kii emspi main ab tak kii sabase badi badhat kii ja sakati he

 Hardly this happens when India's well-known badminton player Jwala Gatta does not live in controversies
 bhartiya pita or chini mata kii santan, dubles kii nami khilaadi 30 varshiya jwaala majaak main kahati hai shaayad sthapit niyamon ko chunauti dena uske khun main hi he
 The disciplinary committee of the Badminton Association of India (BAI), which investigated allegations of alleged misconduct in the Indian Badminton League (IBL), which began in August, recommended a life ban on the strongman before he could complete his work
 She did it
 isaki vajah se jwaala ek baar phir se apane kariyar ko bachaane ke liye ladaai lard rahi hai
 Just a day after the committee's recommendation came on October 10, the Delhi High Court ordered that the ban imposed on them be stayed until the committee's investigation is complete
 kai varisht khiladinnon ne bii or uske taanashaah adhyaksh akhilesh das gupta ke faisle ko ‘jarurat se zyada sakht’ or ‘haasyaaspad’ bataate hue naaraazgi jataai
 These players have termed the decision of the High Court in favor of Jwala a major victory
 lekin jwaala jaanati hai ki abhi to yah jang kii shuruyaat he
 Confident, Jwala told India Today, “I have won on just one front
 mujhe to puri jang jeetni he lekin ve bhi mujhe haraane kii koi kasar baaki nahin chodenge
 i will keep fighting till the end for the good of badminton
 mujhe nahin maaloom ki aakhirkaar maine aisa kya bura kar diya he yaa mere saath itnaa kharaab suluk kyon kiya ja rahaa he
 Perhaps i have not been able to appease the ego of the prominent people associated with badminton of the country
 ”jwaala or unki saathi khilaadi ashvini ponppa desh kii ekmaatr aisi jodi he jisane vishwa badminton championships main bharat ke liye koi padak jeeta he
 He raised his voice in July only because his base price was reduced from $ 50,000 to $ 25,000 at the auction for the IBL players
 jwaala ko bataaya gaya ki bhale hi unka states ‘iken’ player kaa he lekin dubles ke khiladinnon ko itnaa zyada price tag nahin diya ja saktaa
 Jwala said, "it is disgusting
" 
 
 nayaa venture shuru karne kaa yah koi tarika nahin he
 At that time, BAI kept silence
 lekin 25 agast ko ibl match main hui ek ghatana main jwaala ko nishaanaa banane kii koshish kii gai
 The case was that in the final moments before his team Delhi Smashers started the match between Banga Beats in this tournament, the opposition team took their injured player Hong Kong's John Yunsson from Denmark
 jwaala ne apni team kii varisht khilaadi hone ke naate maamle ko adhikariyon ke samaksh uthaaya
 This led the Tamtamai Federation to issue a show cause notice to Jwala asking them to respond within two weeks
 jab maamle kii jaanch chal hi rahi thi to bich main hi 9 aktubar ko federation ke teen sadasyeey anushaasan panel ne jwaala par aaajeevan pratibandh lagane kii sifarish kar di
 The committee played another game in it
 panel ne kaha ki agar jwaala bina shart maafee maangane ko taiyaar hon to “maanviya aadhaar” par bii pramukh pratibandh main utani dheel de sakate hai jitani ve uchit samajhate hai
 Jwala decided that she would neither bow down to BAI nor try to appease the ego of the Federation
 jwaala ne court kii raah chuni
 In court, BAI alleged that his performance in the last three years has not met expectations
 lekin justise ve
 K
 jain ko jwaala kii baat khari lagi or unhone ste order jari karte hue federation se kaha ki vah bina uchit jaanch-padtaal ke khilaadi ko pratadit karne se baj aae
 Jwala says, "this whole game is being played in a very interesting way
 agar maine koi aisa aparaadh kiya he jiske liye aaajeevan pratibandh kii sajaa mukarrar he to isse mujhe sirf maafee maang kar kaise chhot mil sakati he?” khilaadi ko taumr khilne se rokane vaale aise aadesh aam taur par bahut gambhir aparaadh jaise doping yaa match phixing par hi die jate hai
 Vimal Kumar, who was a national coach, says that the order of the High Court has shaken the reputation of Indian badminton
 jwaala ko 10 saal kii umr main khel sikhaane vaale ek anya purv neshnal coach es
 M
 aarif or bhi sakht lahaza apanaate hai, “uske kathith duvryavhaar kii bajaae maafee par jor dena saaf bataata he ki bii kii gaadi patari se utari hui he
 Jwala, who has been a veteran player and current Chief Coach Pullela Gopichand, is also upset with the silence on the matter
 unhone shaq jaahir kiya he ki ve unke khilaaf sajeesh main shaamil hai
 Jwala says, "it is sad that he has not put his side on the matter
 desh main dubles kii aisi koi jodi nahin he jo meri or ashvini kii jagah le sake
 So, will the Chief Coach allow this to happen to us and will the country lose its chance to win a medal? ”jwala and Gopichand have been in a bad relationship
 jwaala kii shikaayat he ki 2006 main jab ve neshnal coach bane to unhone unhen koi tavajjo nahin di thi
 She says, “I was just 23 years old and a national champion in those days, but even then i was thrown out without giving any reason
 coach ne kaha tha ki khel ke lihaaj se meri umr kaaphi ho gai he or ab mujhe juniurs ko aage badaae kaa mauka dena chahie
 Later, when i turned 26, she said that the players who cross the 25-year stage cannot perform better
 yah baat nahin bhuuli ja sakati ki jab unhone ol-england khitaab jeeta tha to unki umr 29 varsh kii thi
 Then i remained silent
 ”khelon main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim chalaane vaale clin spotrs india jaise swatantra sanghathan puri tarah se jwaala ke saath hai
 National Convenor and former Sports Administrator of Clean Sports India b
 ve
 P
 raav kehete hai, “kisi bhi khel kii pehali shart usamen nishpakshta he
 But this did not happen in this case
 yah kisi antarrashtriya str ke khilaadi ke saath purv niojit dhang se ranjish nikaalane jaisaa he
 This is the worst example of how sports organizations are being run like the feudal system of the 15th century
 ”lekin raav ko ummid he ki us samay halaat badal jaaenge jab rashtriya khel vikaas vidheyak ko sansad main paarit kar diya jayega
 Rao says, "we hope that this will be possible in the winter session of Parliament
" ” is vidheyak main teen nikaay banane kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya he
 The first Appellate Sports Tribunal, to be headed by the retiring Chief Justice of the High Court, while the second body will be the Sports Election Commission and the third Ethics Commission
 iskaa makasad yah he ki rashtriya federation main khiladinnon ko mauka mili
 For this, there is a provision of 25 percent reservation in the executive committee of all sports administration related organizations and it is proposed to fix the tenure of the officials
 is bich jwaala ko lagane laga he ki bii ek baar phir se unhen nishaanaa banane ke liye koi harakat karegi
 She says, "the issues i have raised are directly related to how the administration is being run and how it should be run
 ye log aisi koi baat sunanaa katai pasand nahin karte
 But, no matter what happens, i will not stop listening to my heart
 ” The bodies of the Sanatapakshi are being buried in the lake residing with the samples sent to Bareilly and Dehradun for investigation
 The burial of the native and foreign birds in the famous Sambhar lake of Rajasthan is not taking its name
 5 din main 10 hajaar se zyada pakshiyon kii maut ke baad ab centre sarkaar ne sambar jhil main team bheji he
 No one can understand the sudden death of birds in Sambhar Lake in this way
 iske chalate maamle kii jaanch ke liye ab bareli or dehradun main sample bheje gaye hai
 Sambhar lake of Rajasthan is famous for its beauty all over the world
 90 squaire kilometre main faili is vishaal jhil main har vakt 30 hajaar se zyada pakshiyon kii chahak goonjati rahati thi, lekin pichley 5 dinon se yahaan sannata he
 The British made salt from this lake first in the country and even today people like to eat salt of Sambhar Lake 
 magar yah namak hajaaron deshi or videshi pakshiyon ke liye jehar ban gaya he
 This Sambhar lake has been a graveyard for birds for the last 5 days
 jahaan dekho vahaan ret par pakshiyon ke marane ke avshesh dikh rahe hai
 However, the Rajasthan government woke up about two days before the matter, after which the rescue team is working to send the tortured birds out of the lake to the rescue center
 saath hi mare hue pakshiyon ko dafan kiya ja rahaa he, taaki inase sankraman na faile
 SDRF team engaged in searching the bodies of birds in the lake, due to water and swamp in the lake, SDRF team has been engaged in the work of finding the bodies of birds
 sarkari aankadon ke mutabik ab tak 9000 se zyada pakshi dam tod chuke he or kareeb 400 pakshiyon ko ghayal avasthaa main rescue centre main rakhaa gaya he
 Many of the birds who died had flown 5000 km to reach their favorite Sambhar Lake
 marane vaale pakshiyon main sabase zyada 3200 nardan savaler hai
 Apart from this there are 2600 Kentish Plover, 1000 Rough, 600 co-mankot Blackwing and 600 Black Wing Stealth Ring Birds

 Therefore the rule of one person one post can also apply here
 haalanki, is tarah kii koi baat saamne nahin ai he
 Let us know that due to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party elections to be held in September 2018 last year were postponed
 tab party ne tay kiya tha ki pad par rahane vaale sabhi log chunaav nateezon tak apana kaam jari rakhenge

 In the match played at Motilal Nehru School of Sports, Pune defeated Haryana 38-22 in a one-sided match
 pehle half main mejabaan team ne puri tarah se pune ke saamne ghutane tech die the, haalanki duusare half main usne vaapasi kii koshish kii, lekin pune ne use hameshaa roke hi rakhaa
 In this half, the host team scored more points than the first half, but they could not prove enough to win
 tippaniyan Pune's winning heroes were Deepak Hooda and Sandeep Narwal
 donon ne kramash: 13 or aath ank liye
 Deepak Kumar took 11 points for Haryana
 pehle half main monu ne safal red maarthe hue pune kaa khaataa kholaa, lekin deepak kumaar ne turant score baraabar kar diya
 From here, Pune took consecutive points and Haryana went backward
 10wein minute tak pune ne 12-1 kii badhat le lee thi
 The hosts took some points in the remaining 10 minutes, but they were not enough to reduce the difference in points
 pehle half kii samaapti tak pune 18-6 se aage thi
 In the second half, the host team scored faster than Pune
 usne score ek samay 17-26 kar diya tha, lekin pehle half main ank na le paane kii galati kaa use khamiyaja bhugatna padaa or ant main use haar hi mili

 In Delhi, a man burnt his wife alive
 vaardaat ke samay aaropee kaa chota bhai or ek chachaa bhi maujuud tha
 People from the neighborhood and the police admitted the victim to the hospital on the spot, where she died
 haalanki, kisi tarah peedita ne apane bayaan darj kara die
 The police have arrested the accused
 jaankaree ke mutabik, yah maamla vikaspuri ilaake kaa he
 Parvinder Kaur (24) was married to Gurucharan in 2012
 kuch din baad hi sasuraal paksh ne use dahej ke tang karnaa shuru kar diya
 Her husband used to make new demands every day
 isse donon ke bich tanaav bana rahata tha
 After a quarrel in the past, Gurucharan expelled him from the house
 agle din, vah bete or apane kapade lene ke liye sasuraal gai
 Her husband and the rest of the people listened after seeing her
 iske baad gussaye aropiyon ne uske upar kerosine daalkar aag laga di
 Police reached the information of the local people and admitted him to Safdarjung Hospital in critical condition, where he died during treatment
 polisake mutabik, gurcharan ke pita ke dehanth ke baad uske chachaa ravel singh kii najar property par bhi thi
 Parvinder came to know about this, due to which he often provoked her husband
 vah aksar dahej na dene ke taane detaa rahata tha
 In this incident, the victim had burnt about 80 percent
 kisi tarah usne apane bayaan darj karaaen hai
 Photographs of some schoolgirls allegedly assaulting school children in Gurugram are disturbing
 padmavat ke virodh main gurugram main karani sena kii gundgardee kaa alam yah he ki unhone ek skool bas main aag bhi laga di
 Not just Gurugram, there have been reports of Karni Sena infestation in several cities of BJP ruled states including Ahmedabad, Allahabad, Jaipur
 karani sena kaa zyaadaatar ugr pradarshan bijepi shasit rajyon main hi ho rahaa he, aise main yah sawaal uthanaa shuru ho gaya he ki kya is kathith sena kii gundai se nipatane main bijepi kii rajya sarkarein aksham sabit ho rahi hai? aise halaat se in rajyon main aane vaala nivesh bhi prabhavit ho saktaa he
 The biggest example of this inefficiency is the BJP government of Manohar Lal Khattar
 aisa lagata he ki haryana main police naam kii koi cheez nahin he
 Everyone again remembers the violence that happened on August 25 last year
 ek or bijepi shasit rajya gujarat ke ahmedabad main bhi film padmavat ke virodh ko lekar karani sena ne jamkar bavaal kaata he
 Significantly, the governments of the four bjp-ruled states of Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan had earlier banned the performance of Padmavat in their own state
 lekin supreme court ke aadesh or fatkaar ke baad in rajyon main bhi padmavat kaa pradarshan kiya ja rahaa he
 It was astonishing for these governments to openly join this crowd for the benefit of electoral politics
 chaaron rajya sarkaron ne to haath khadey kar liye the ki padmavat ke pradarshan ke baad kanoon-vyavastha kii dikkat hui to ve kuch nahin kar paaenge
 But now despite the order of the Supreme Court, the administration in the four states does not seem to be doing much
 aise main court ko in rajyon ko sakhti se sawaal karnaa hoga ki kanoon-vyavastha rajya sarkaar kaa hissaa he yaa nahin, or ve apane rajya kii seemaa main shanti-vyavastha banaae rakhane main sakasham hai yaa nahin?nivesh kam hone kaa darawaise to kanoon ke dar se in rajyon kaa koi bhi sattarudh netaa koi bhadakaau bayaan nahin de rahaa, lekin har koi jaanata he ki arajak tatv kaabo se baahar hai
 Two days ago, PM Modi has come to Davos to invite the world's leading businessmen to invest in India, does it seem that any sensible investor would want to invest in these BJP ruled states which could not even ensure minimum acceptable law and order
 Investment in the states of North India has already been reduced due to weak infrastructure and law and order problem
 aise main is tarah ke udhaaharan niveshkon ko or hatotsahit hi karenge
 Even in the South Indian state of Kerala, it was recently seen that due to the violence of CPM-RS, the investment there is now reduced than before
 uttar bharat main pehle se hi gaurakshak, naitikta ke thekedaar kanoon-vyavastha kii samasya khadi karte rahe hai
 These people are tarnishing the inclusive image of India
 ye logsarkaronke upar sawalia nishaan lagaate hai ki ve aakhir kuch kar paane main sakasham hai yaa nahin? hc's comment on Uddhav Thackeray's swearing 'avoid such a program in public places' will be sworn in on Thursday evening Uddhav Thakreshv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will take oath as Chief Minister on Thursday evening

 Now they are being described more boldly
 unke banaae gaye chitron main bayaan kaam or ichha kii kahaniyon kii antarrashtriya press main tarif bhari samikshaayen likhi gai hai
 But it is often difficult for these reviewers to keep pace with their cursory knowledge of the arranged marriage or the understanding of the highly used paras of the Kamasutra

 asipi (charminar khand) di venkat narsai ne bataaya, ‘chaar minar ilaake main kharidari ke liye aae satpati par ek naaballig jebkatre ne kathith taur par tab chaaku se hamalaa kar diya jab kuch log uskaa peechha kar rahe the
 On the basis of initial investigation, the ACP said, 'kishore pickpocket whitener seems addicted to sniffing
 charminar ilaake ke nikat kuch logon ne peechha kar use pakadaa or use peeta
 DRDO officers were standing close by and the boy ran away
 ’ police ne bataaya ki ladkaa faraar hone main kaamyaab rahaa or use pakadaney kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The senior police officer said, "the DRDO officer was immediately taken to a hospital and his condition is out of danger
" ’ diardio ke jansampark nideshaalay ke nideshak ravi kumaar gupta ne bataaya ki military airvardiness ke kshetreey centre ke kshetreey nideshak yahaan daure par the
 The incident has nothing to do with the 'DRDO case'
 chunaav ayog dwaara loksabhaa chunaav kaa bigul bajaane ke saath hi jang kii vaastavik shuruyaat ho chuki he
 Elections are marathon races as well as long hurdles, with many hurdles and highs
 isliye daud kii shuruyaat main hi koi anumaan lagaana ghaatak sabit ho saktaa he
 Nevertheless, let me tell you 10 reasons why i feel that at the moment Modi is clearly visible in the forefront
 1
 Today's election is for money, machine and media, today's election is for money, machine and media and Team Modi has a huge edge in this
 bhartiya chunaavon ke itihaas main kabhi bhi media kii soch itani ekatarfa nahin rahi he
 The ruling party has a huge money power and the party's machinery to connect with voters on all the platforms is well-adjusted
 is tarah bijepi jahaan ek chamchamati, acchhee tarah se taiyaar faraari jaisi he to uski tulana main congress ek second hand puraane jamaane kii ambesder jaisi dikh rahi he
 It is no surprise that BJP has already spent many times more than its rivals
 2
 Even now, Modi is the number one leader
 Now Mr
 Modi is number one leader with a lot of gaps
 chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan modi ne athak urja, behtareen sanchaar kaushal or party ke kad se bhi zyada waar karne kii kshamta dikhaai he
 The BJP and the government have got the top one charismatic leadership with the slogan ‘modi hai toh is possible’
 tarifon kii aawaaj chiyarliders jaisi vishaal sena kii vajah se kai guna bad jaati he or hip bana rahata he
 This is a case of the 70s Amitabh Bachchan movie in which even a bad screenplay could not prevent the film from bumper opening
 piem modi kaa vishaal kad bijepi ko lagaataar urja de rahaa he
 He has organized so many rallies and events before the election announcement, as all his main rivals have not been able to do together
 haa, yah sach he ki loklubhaavan jumalon or lagaataar event marketing jaise prayaason se, jo aksar jamini sachai se pare hote hai, logon main niraashaa bhi he, lekin aisa nahin lagata he ki yah votaron kii naaraazgi main badali he
 Modi's balloon has not exploded in that way, his vigilantly hard-working 'karmayogi' and political will and the courage to take risks remain to a large extent the image of Balakot as the latest example of his decisive leadership
 Is going
 3
 Amit Shah's Election Engineering: PM Modi and BJP are getting the benefit of Amit Shah's Election Engineering
 saal 2014 main amit shah upi ke incharge the or rajya main bijepi ko jabardast safalataa mili
 As party president in 2019, he is now in charge of BJP across the country
 haalanki, bhartiya raajnneeti main 'sabake liye koi ek formula' kargar nahin hota- shah ke netritv main bijepi ko 2015 main dilli or bihar main badi haar mil chuki he
 But resourceful and ruthless Shah embodies' Sama, daam, dand, bhed ', his political philosophy is that' more means more than means
 'iske alaava, sangh ke samarpit kaaryakarta, booth tak maujuud kaaryakarta or bijepi kaa majboot sanghathan sambhavit matadaataaon tak party kii pahunch ko aasaan banaate hai
 4
 congress kii kharaab halatahindi pattee ke teen mahatvapurn rajyon main jeet milane ke teen maheene ke baad congress vah raftaar nahin banaae rakh pai he
 The Modi government has rapidly overcome its weaknesses and announced several reliefs for farmers, upper castes, medium and small scale industries etc
 gutbaji, bhitarghaat or nirnay lene main susti kii vajah se yah kaaphi puraani party avasaron ko apane liye bhunaa nahin paa rahi he
 The truth is that the Congress has come out of the ICU, but it needs immediate rehabilitation work
 aise rajyon main jahaan sidhe bijepi banaam congress kii ladaai he, vahaan bijepi phaayde main rah sakati he
 5
 rahul gandhi kaa netritvcongress adhyaksh rahul gandhi rahasyon main lipati hui ek paheli bane hue hai
 The battle of Gujarat in 2017 and the December 2018 assembly elections have earned him respect as a militant campaigner, but he still has not shown any organizational or human management skills, or sharp political knowledge, which has led him to power Can be considered a natural contender for and an attraction for the entire opposition
 udhaaharan ke liye unhone mayawati yaa mamata tak vyaktigat str par pahunchane kii koi koshish nahin kii
 His Rafale-focused campaign is also like a double-edged sword as it diverts attention from important issues like agrarian crisis, jobs
 6
 The grand opposition of the Grand Alliance is still not ready to attack with a common minimum program or a common platform that goes beyond Modi opposition or can identify any collective leadership that challenges the Narrative of 'modi vs Kaun' Could
 sabhi 543 siton par ek saajhe morche par ladane kii jagah vipaksh ab vot vibhajit hone ke jokhim kaa saamana kar rahaa he, khaskar upi jaise mahatvapurn rajyon main
 Congress has to think whether this election is for its own rise or to reduce BJP across the country? Similarly, regional politicians like Mayawati will also have to think strongly about the alliance before the elections
 7
 According to the figures, the BJP had won almost 90 per cent of the seats in north and west India in 2014
 is tarah kaa pradarshan to is baar sambhav nahin lagata, lekin bijepi is baar bhi is ilaake main apane pratidwandviyon ke mukaable 75 se 100 siten zyada paa sakati he
 It should not be forgotten that in the 2014 elections, BJP won 42 Lok Sabha seats with more than 3 lakh votes, 75 seats with more than 2 lakh votes and 38 seats 1
 5 lakh se zyada voton se jiti hai
 So to prevent the BJP from becoming the largest political party this time, it will need to lean heavily to the contrary
 bijepi ko 200 siton se zyada milti he, to endie kii sarkaar phir se ban sakati he
 8
 upi jaisaa mahatvapurn rajyaupi main sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko lekar vipaksh main to baari charchaa he or utsaah he or usee tarah se priyanka gandhi wadra ke 'aupchaarik' taur par raajnneeti main shaamil hone kaa bhi
 But the nephew's nexus is still far from the ground equations
 udaarahan ke liye yah dekhnaa hoga ki kya yadav voter aasaani se basapa kii taraf jayega? isi tarah priyanka ke raajnneeti main utarane kaa bhi koi khaas asar hota nahin dikh rahaa
 On the other hand, the BJP has thrown a lot of its weight in UP
 rajya main bijepi yadi 2014 ke 73 ke mukaable aadhi siten bhi jeet pai to modi sarkaar ko phir aane se koi nahin roak paaegaa
 So the road to Delhi seems certain that this time too it will pass through Lucknow
 9
 From Pulwama, Pakistan, Balakot Airstrike Jayasriram to Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Babar's Aulad to Pakistani Jihadi, from saffron-clad saints to those wearing military uniforms, the Modi government is advancing the agenda of Pulwama and Balakot which is Put national security at the center of political conventions
 aakraamak raajnneeti kaa yah brands ho saktaa he ki seemaant gramin ilaakon or dakshin bharat main simit asar daale, lekin yah shahari ilaakon or mahatvapurn hindi pattee main kaaphi kuch badal saktaa he
 10
 'hidutv' vaala nayaa yuva voterchunaav ayog ke mutabik desh main 8
 40 million people are going to vote for the first time, which is about 10 percent of the total voters
 yah aisa voter he jiske dimag main babari masjid ke dhahne yaa 2002 ke gujarat dangon kii koi smriti nahin he
 This is the young population, influenced by Modi's slogans like 'new India', 'strong Government', 'how is the Josh'
 is yuva jansankhya ko yah baat prabhavit karti he ki 'aatankwaad par sakht niti honi chahie', 'chalo pehle kashmir masalaa nipta len'
 bjp's main middle-class Hindu right-wing supporters suit a confrontation with the 'rogue' Islamic country of Pakistan
 agar vipaksh ek hokar 'kisaan-noujvaan' kii arthvyavastha par zyada kendrit charchaa ko aage nahin badhaata, to bijepi kaa majboot rashtrawaad nishchit rup se 2019 kaa agenda set karegaa
 Conditions apply: Here i would like to mention the atmosphere created before the 2004 elections
 aaj ke maahaul kii tarah tab bhi yahi lagata tha ki atalji ke alaava or koi pradhanmantri nahin ban saktaa
 His re-election was also considered more powerful than today's PM Modi
 lekin vah haar gaye, kyonki dakshin ke do rajyon tamilnadu or andhra ke unke sahyogi chhitak gaye the or upi 'shining india' ke naaron se prabhavit nahin hua
 No wave arises from the eco-chamber or improvised studio analysis of the capital, but in the dust of the country's interior
 isi vajah se bharat ke matadaata kaa vyavhaar kuch-kuch landan ke mausam jaisaa he, jo hameshaa badalata rahata he

 The Congress said that Modi has got the dubious identity of being the world's first leader for insulting the first government abroad and calling it bad
 congress pravaktaa arpyen singh ne kaha ki aisa pehali baar nahin hua he kipradhanmantrine videsh main gharelu raajnneeti kaa vishay uthaaya
 Modi also made controversial comments during official visits to Germany, Canada and China
 ek anyacongresspravaktaa mim afjal ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ko apane pad kii garima rakhni chahie thi
 If he targets the previous governments while in the country, then there is no problem, but on foreign lands, he should avoid doing so
 arpyen ne kaha ki pradhanmantri jab bhi videshi dharti par pair rakhte hai, aisa lagata he ki vah apana maansik santulan kho dete hai
 Insulting your own country on foreign soil is a sign of immature leadership
 unhone kaha ki is tarah ke bayaan raashtra kaa apmaan hai or inaki ninda kii jaani chahie
 RPN said that it is not the policy of Congress to criticize the Prime Minister when he is abroad, but today we had to do it by force

 com / 8kkowvgf4j — Irene (@ ireneiam4) September 23, 2018 pradhanmantri pad kii dobaaraa shapath lene ke baad apane pehle videsh daure par shanivaar ko maldive pahunche narendra modi ne maldive kii sansad main aatankwaad ko lekar bina naam liye pakistan par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said that water is now going over the head
 unhone kaha, ab bhi kuch log good tebrist or bed tebrist main fark karne kii galati kar rahe hai
 He called the Global Conference essential and said that terrorism is the biggest threat to humanity
 piem modi ne kaha ki isse nipatna badi chunauti he
 If we do not take this as a challenge, the generations to come will not forgive us
 unhone kaha ki aatankwaadiyon ke na to apane bank hote hai or naa hi hathiyaaron kii factory, phir bhi unhen paise or hathiyaaron kii kabhi kami nahin hoti
 Taking a dig at Pakistan, PM Modi said that today state sponsored terrorism remains the biggest threat
 unhone ne kaha ki aatanvaad kisi ek desh ke liye nahin, sampurna maanavtaa ke liye khatra he
 This is a challenge for the whole world
 unhone kaha ki aatankwaad or kattarta kii chunauti se ladane ke liye vishwa samudaay kaa ekajute hona jaruri he
 Referring to the old relations between India and Maldives, PM Modi said that there is no greater partner for India than Maldives
 bharat or maldive ke sambandh itihaas se bhi puraane hai
 Sea waves are fortifying the banks of both countries
 ye lehren hamaare logon ke bich mitrataa kaa sandesh-vaahak rahi hai
 Our culture has grown with the power of these waves
 piem modi ne padosi pehle ko apni praathamikta bataate hue kaha ki achche-bure vakt main aapasi vishwaas ko ham or pukhta karenge
 India has always shared its achievements with its neighbors
 unhone kaha ki maldive main swatantraaa, loktantr, khushhaali or shanti ke samarthan main bharat maldive ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar khadaa rahaa he
 PM Modi, referring to the old events, said that whether it was the 1988 incident, the 2004 tsunami or the recent water-crisis
 hamen garv he ki bharat har mushkil main, aapke har prayaas main har ghadi har kadam aapke saath chalaa he
 How much color this message of Modi will bring from Maldives Parliament is in the womb of future
 lekin itnaa jarur he ki piem modi ke is sambodhan se yah spasht ho gaya ki vah aatankwaad ke khilaaf vaishvik ekajutata or sanyukt sangharsh ke apane ruukh par kaayam hai
 This message of PM Modi is also considered to be important when after his second time taking over the power of the country, Prime Minister of neighboring Pakistan Imran Khan has repeatedly expressed the desire to negotiate between the two countries
 duusari taraf kashmir main aatankwaadiyon kii sakriyata main bhi ijapha hua he
 The terrorists have attacked the CRPF camp, which was thwarted by the vigilance of the soldiers
 30 may se ab tak sena ne ghati main ek darjan se adhik aatankwaadiyon ko maar giraaya he
 PM Modi's address is being seen as a clear message of not making any change in the old policy that if Pakistan does not curb terror, India will not back down from carrying out actions like surgical strikes
 skool ke dinon kii yaaden to aaj bhi aapako acchhee tarah yaad hongi
 When there were many faces in a classroom, there was a beauty queen, sportman, gossip girl, topper and a failure
 yahi nahin wo din yaad he jab class room main teacher ke sawaal poochhate hi jawaab dene ke time sab ek duusare kii surat dekhne lagate
 In such a situation, our class topper student would get up and start answering in such a way that everyone would stop speaking
 teachers bhi uski tarife karte nahin thakte
 When the class came to an end, many Gossip girls would find themselves saying that this topper has some setting from the teachers
 ye sunakar tab to nahin lekin magar aaj bahut hansi aati he
 If you want to bring many such memories, then we have brought for you golden memories of school days

 Iraq's largest Shia religion guru last week appealed to the government to jointly choose a new prime minister so that the country could come out of this bad phase
 lekin, iraqi sansad ke shuru hone se pehle hi iesas ke sargana abu-bakar-al-bagdadi ne ye kah kar sabko chaunkaa diya he ki wo 'da independent' ke naam se ek alag desh bana rahaa he
 In this new country, all the areas and cities of Iraq and Syria will come where the extremists have taken possession

 According to experts, after the announcement of Baghdadi, many terrorist organizations of the world can join him

 The terrorists of India are also with Baghdadi! If sources are to be believed, some terrorists of India are also supporting Baghdadi

 The name of this person is being described as Haji Fakruddin Usman Ali

 lekin khufia agenciyon ko dar he ki osman ali bagdadi ke hi ishaare par hindustan aa rahaa he or uskaa makasad yahaan aakar dehshat failaane kaa he
 However, Indian intelligence agencies have not been able to estimate how many Indians in Iraq and Syria are helping abu-bakr al-baghdadi or fighting on its behalf
 lekin unke mutabik bharat se badi taadaad main kam umr ke ladke pashchim asia gaye hai or inamen se kuch ladakon ko aatankwaadiyon ne military training bhi di he
 Clearly, if abu-bakr-al-baghdadi's moves are not stopped quickly, it will become a new headache for the whole world after al-qaeda

 vaise to embibies karne ke liye neshnal entress eligibility test yani neet main paas hona aavashyak he or uski rank ke aadhaar par ummidavaaron ko admician kiya jaataa he
 But the reality is that people are getting admission on getting one or two numbers or zero numbers and they are also studying MBBS
 ji haa haal hi main saamne ai ek report ke anusaar saal 2017 main badi sankhya main aise chaatro ko bhi embibies course main admician mil gaya he, jinke NEET (neet) main ek yaa do yaa phir donon vishyon main jiro yaa single disit number he

 phir bhi in sabhi chaatro ko embibies course main daakhila mil gaya or ve padhai bhi kar rahe hai
 It is being told that these candidates have got admission in private colleges
 is report ke saamne aane ke baad sawaal khadey ho rahe hai ki aakhir is test kaa kya mahatv rah gaya he
 In fact, the newspaper analyzed the marks of 1,990 students who got admission in 2017 and their marks are less than 150
 530 aise students saamne aae jinako fijics, chemistry yaa donon main jiro yaa single disit main number mili

 kumbh par yojit india today ke golmes sammelan ke chauthe seshan main kumbh main mahila sanyasi or saadhuon par charchaa hui
 In this discussion Mahant Devyagiri of Mankameshwar Temple of Lucknow attended
 is dauraan unhone bataur mahila sanyasi apana anubhav saajha kiya, saath hi unhone yah bhi bataaya ki kaise unhen diksha mili
 Actually, when we talk about saints and akharas in Hinduism, we see that there is more participation of men in it
 mahila sanyasi kaa kaam kya hota or vah kya kaam karti hai yah kam hi log jaanate hai
 Mahant Devyagiri said that in the name of the saint, the distinction between man and woman ends in the juna arena
 jab ham sadhu, sanyasi yaa sant bol rahe hote hai to wo apane aap main bhed tod rahaa hota he
 He neither lives in a woman nor remains in a man
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki usko donon kaary karne hote hai
 He said that the origin of the akharas is from around 1780
 13 akhaadon main june akhaada sabase bada he
 And as he is older, his thinking is also bigger
 unhone kaha ki 2003-04 ke bich ujjain kumbh ke dauraan meri diksha hui thi
 After that initiation is considered a complete ascetic
 unhone kaha ki ek aam sabha se nikalakar koi jaataa he to ek stri ke sharir ko lekar uski jo samaj or jhijak hoti he vah diksha hone ke baad tut jaati he
 In front of everyone, we are given two clothes in the group
 24 ghante ek mantra kaa jaap hota he
 He has to do it
 uske baad raatri main 1-2 baje ke bich snaan karaayaa jaataa he
 Only two clothes are given after the bath
 mahant devyagiri ne kaha ki 100 se 120 logon kii saath main diksha hoti he
 But the thing that i felt there was that shame came over here
 yani ki aap nirbhik hokar samaaj ke andar kaam kar paaenge
 This feeling immediately comes inside you
 yahaan aakar yah maaloom pad jaataa he ki koi kaary chota yah bada nahin he
 When we talk of Juna Arena, there is a similarity here
 unhone kaha ki jo bhartiyata kaa vichaar he wo samaan rup se he
 They have to walk together shoulder to shoulder
 stri ko sahyog chahie hota he or sahyog ke rup main purushon kaa saath chahie hota he
 This resemblance is seen in the Juna Arena
