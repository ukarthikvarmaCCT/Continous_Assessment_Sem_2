 After Goa, Bihar, the strategy of defeating BJP in Manipur and Meghalaya is being worked out in its own way
 goa main jahaan congress netaaon ne rajyapal se milane kaa samay maanga he, inke baad bihar main bhi tejasvi yadav ne aisa hi kiya he
 And now former Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh in Manipur, former CM Mukul Sangma in Meghalaya have sought an appointment with the Governor

 goa main kya hua

 yahaan congress ne 20 siten jeetin thi, vahiin bijepi ne keval 2 siten
 Despite this, the BJP formed the government with 6 parties led by the NPP
 karnataka main kya hua he
 
 ?karnataka main 15 may ko jab nattejey aae to bijepi 104 siton ke saath sabase badi party banakar ubhari

 The time has come for all Kashmiri Pandits to be rehabilitated and get the franchise
 ''saamana' main chape lekh ke mutabik 'hamaare desh memhinduon ke matadhikaaraki chintaa kisi ko nahin, lekin musalamaanon ke bare main kuch log vyaktigat hokar bevajaah kulbulate hue 'matam' kar rahe hai
 Has anyone ever thought about the franchise of Kashmiri Pandits

 The BSP chief Mayawati ji should first state that the BSP candidate in Rae Bareli and Amethi will not contest or if the BSP candidate does not fight there, then it is understood that the BSP is trying to cheat the public from the Congress from 2004 to 14
 up's deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya ran the Congress government at the Center, targeting Mayawati after this statement
 unhone twit kiya,' basapa pramukh mayawati ji pehle yah bataaen kii raibareli or amethi main basapa kaa pratyaashee chunaav ladega ki nahin ladega agar vahaan basapa pratyaashee nahin ladega to congress se basapa kaa samajha hota he

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has made special provisions in the General Budget 2018 to double the income of farmers by 2022
 isamen unhone kisaanon ko unki fasal par aane vaali laagat kaa 50 fisadi yani dedh guna emspi badhaakar dene kii baat kahi he
 Let's know what it means, where did this idea come from and how much benefit are the farmers going to actually get
 2004 main upie sarkaar ne kisaanon ke liye rashtriya ayog banaaya tha
 Its goal was to give its suggestions to tackle the problem of farming, food production, drought in India
 is ayog ko swaminathan kamishan ke naam se janaa gaya
 The commission in its report (2006) had asked farmers to pay MSP of 50 per cent of the cost incurred on crops
 bharat main fasalon par aati he teen tarah kii laagatis kamishan ne fasal par aane vaali laagat ko teen hisson- A2, A2+FL or C2 main baanta tha
 A2 costs include all cash costs incurred in the crop production of farmers
 isamen beej, khaad, chemical, majdoor laagat, eendhan laagat, sinchai aadi laagtein shaamil hoti hai
 The A2 + FL cost also includes the cash cost as well as the estimated cost of hard work of family members
 vahiin C2 laagat main fasal utpaadan main ai nagdi or gaiyr nagdi ke saath hi jameen par lagane vaale lij rent or jameen ke alaava duusari krishi pusjiyon par lagane vaala byaaj bhi shaamil hota he
 Jaitley has said nothing, nothing is clear
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that farmers will get 50 percent MSP on the cost of their crops
 haalanki, unhone yah saaf nahin kiya ki yah emspi kis tarah kii laagat par milegaa
 The cost of farmers is counted in three categories since the arrival of the Swaminathan Commission
 kisaanon ko agar C2 laagat par 50 fisadi emspi mili to hi unke liye phaayde kii baat ho sakati he
 At 50 per cent of the A2 cost, they will get a much lower price
 ek kuntal gehun 144 rupee ghate main bechega kisanek anumaan ke mutabik 2017-18 main upjaye gehun kii A2+FL laagat 817 rupee prati kuntal baithti he
 By adding 50 per cent cost to it, the MSP comes to Rs 1325 per quintal
 gehun kii hi C2 laagat 1256 rupee prati kuntal baithti he or isamen 50 fisadi laagat or jodne se emspi 1879 rupee prati kuntal ho jaati he
 The current central government had fixed MSP of wheat at Rs 1735 quintal in October 2017
 is tarah se kisaan ko prati kuntal gehun par 144 rupee kam milenge
 No preparation, how to get MSP done? It should also be remembered that only 6% farmers of the country get MSP on their crop
 baaki kisaanon kii fasal bichauliyon, sahukaron or duusare dallalon ke paas jaati he
 The Finance Minister has also not clarified what arrangements will be made to get 94 percent of the farmers MSP
 unki kharid ko sarkari kharid kendron main pahunchaana kaise sunishchit hoga, yah sabase bada sawaal he
 Without the provisions, how will the income of farmers be doubled? If the agriculture sector is compared to the budget received last year, then the promise of doubling the income of farmers by 2022 also does not seem to be coming down on the ground
 2017-18 main krishi kshetra ke liye 41,886 karod rupee aavantit the, jise baad main riviz karke 41,105 karod rupee kiya gaya tha
 In this budget, this allocation has been increased to Rs 46,700 crore in 2018-19
 yani keval 4,845 karod rupee badhaakar kaise kisaanon kii aay doguni ho sakati he
 This question is also unanswered
 upie-2 banaam endie, kisne kisaanon ko kya diyogendra yadav kaa kahana he ki vitt mantri ne is bajet main kisaanon ko laagat kaa 50 fisadi emspi badhaakar dene kaa vaada kiya he, jo unhen kisi tarah kaa phayda nahin dilaa sakegaa
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Yadav said that the UPA government was giving MSP 70 per cent of the cost
 This table shows why fm's declaration is meaningless
 He has aiming to achieve what the UPA government had already achieved
 In fact his NDA govt has further brought down returns over 'A2+FL'
 pic
 twitter
 com / ukgjibqxoe — Yogendra Yadav (@_yogendrayadav) February 1, 2018 Yogendra Yadav has told in a tweet how the UPA-2 government was giving 70 to 80 percent higher MSP at A2 + FL cost to farmers
 bijepi kisaanon ko isi laagat par 40 se 50 fisadi tak zyada emspi de rahi he
 Through this, they have tried to explain how the NDA government is trying to double the income of farmers
 rashtravaadi congress party ke mukhiya sharad pavaar ke parivaar main bhi viraasat kii siyasat ko lekar ladaai chhidi he
 At the center of this fight are his two grandchildren
 ek pote parth pavaar hai, jinhen sharad pavaar ne is saal apni loksabhaa seat se chunaav maidan main utaara tha
 The other is Rohit Pawar, the grandson of his late elder Bai Appa Saheb Pawar
 jabaki sharad pavaar kii saansad beti supriya sule dilli kii raajnneeti main sakriy ho chukin hai
 In such a situation, these two ships have warped inside to become heirs of Maharashtra's politics
 haalanki do lakh se bhi adhik voton se parth pavaar ke chunaav haar jane ke baad ab rohit pavaar kaa palada majboot lag rahaa he
 Dada became the first member of the Parth Pawar family to lose the election after losing the seat of Sharad Pawar
 'pavaar parivaar' main viraasat kii siyasat ko lekar sangharsh kii pehali jhalak loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan dikhi
 When NCP supremo Sharad Pawar decided not to contest the Lok Sabha elections, he handed over his seat to grandson Parth Pawar
 tab rohit pavaar ne fasebuk post likhakar dada sharad pavaar se apane faisle par punarvichaar karne ke liye kaha tha
 In a report published in the Huffington Post, Partha Pawar says that he (rohit) campaigned in my election
 lekin unke chachere bhai ko is tarah kii fasebuk post nahin likhnaa chahie tha
 Parth said, "if you pick up the phone and write a letter to your father or grandfather instead of calling, i think it's foolish
 unhen sach main apane dada se baat kerani thi na ki sneh dikhaane ke liye patr likhnaa chahie tha
 People took it wrongly
 " vahiin sampark kiye jane par rohit ne kaha, 'ham sabhi saath hai
 None of us have spoken publicly against one of Surrey
 ' haal main sharad pavaar ke saath rohit kii maujuudagi kuch zyada dikhne lagi he
 When Sharad Pawar addressed the media on the ncp's defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Rohit has been appearing alongside him ever since
 isse raajnneetik vaaris banane kii res main rohit ke aage chalane kii charchaaen chal rahi hai
 The political roots of the Pawar family were Dinkarrao Govindrao Pawar alias Appa Saheb Pawar, eldest brother of Sharad Pawar
 vah pavaar parivaar se raajnneeti main utarane vaale pehle sadsy the
 He made a mark in Maharashtra as a major leader fighting for the interests of farmers and laborers
 baad main appa sahib ne apane chote bhai sharad pavaar ko congress se judane ke liye raji kiya
 Sharad Pawar formed the National Congress Party after being expelled from the Congress in 1999 after a confrontation with Sonia Gandhi
 iske baad maharashtra kii raajnneeti main pavaar parivaar kaa dabadabaa or kaayam hua
 Daughter Supriya Sule continued to be an MP from the party
 vahiin sharad pavaar ne apane ek anya bhai anantrao ke bete ajit pavaar ko bhi pramot kiya
 Ajit succeeded in emerging as a politician in Maharashtra
 vah ensipi-congress gathbandhan main dipti siem bhi bane
 Ajit Pawar's son Parth was considered to be the heir to the Pawar family until Appa Saheb's grandson Rohit appeared
 2017 main, rohit ne pavaar parivaar ke baraamati ke home toun se jila parishad kaa chunaav jeeta tha
 Since then he continued to build his land in the state with silence
 rakanpa main kai party kaaryakarta unhen sharad pavaar ke baad vaastavik jananetaa ke rup main dekhte hai
 Unlike Parth, he makes a public appearance with great confidence
 pimpri-chinchvaad main ek party netaa ne kaha," ajit dada sulabh nahin hai, log unase baat karne se darate hai
 Supriya is busy in Delhi politics
 parth khud ko bada rajaneta maanakar vyavhaar karte hai
 Rohit is an exception, he joins the activists
 unamem ham sharad pavaar kii chhavi dekhte hai
 "A section of party workers say that Appa Saheb had brought Sharad Pawar into politics
 aise main rohit ko aage aana chahie
 Asked if he considered himself the political heir of Sharad Pawar, Rohit said, "the party leaders do not decide the political heir
 yah janata tay karti he
 i would like to do something for the society and the state while in politics
 ' udhar parth bhi kisi tarah ke paariwarik vivaad ko khaarij karte hai
 Sources are telling that Rohit Pawar can fight in the upcoming assembly elections by choosing a tough seat
 taaki paariwarik viraasat ke sahare hi safal hone kaa thappa un par na lage
 a party leader says that even if Rohit loses the election, the party workers will sympathize with him
 kaaryakarta sochenge ki ajit pavaar or unke bete ne unhen safal nahin hone diya
 Overall, Rohit is looking ahead in the race
 dilli hai court ne online dawaaon kii bikri par roak lagane ke baavjood court ke adeshon kaa paalan na hone par centre or dilli sarkaar ko notice jari kiya he
 On December 12, the Delhi High Court, while hearing a PIL, banned the online pharmacy
 buudhvaar ko hui sunwaayee main yachikakarta ne bataaya ki court ke pichley adeshon kaa paalan bhi nahin ho paa rahaa he or online farmesi dhadlle se dawaaon kii home delivery kar rahi hai
 Hearing the petition filed by dermatologist Zaheer Ahmed, the court has issued notice to the Central Government and Delhi Government seeking its reply
 court ne is baat ko mana ki logon ke swasthya se khilwaad nahin kiya ja saktaa or is par turant lagaam lagane kii jarurat he
 There is a huge business of online sale of drugs in metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, and there is little control of the state governments as well as the central government on these drugs being sold online
 yahi vajah he ki aksar online bik rahi dawaaon main niyamon ko taak par rakhana aam hota ja rahaa he
 It has been specifically mentioned in the petition that such drugs can be ordered sitting at home through fake prescription of the doctor, which can prove to be risky for life
 iske alaava verified doctor ke prescripshan se bhi jo dawaaen mangai ja rahi hai, wo ek letters head ko anginat baar istemaal karke online farmesi se mangai ja sakati hai
 Drugs under the Drugs and Cosmetic Act 1940 and Pharmacy Act 1948 also cannot be sold online
 yachika main is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he ki kuch websites pratibandhit dawaaon kii bhi supplai kar rahi hai
 But to be honest, monitoring the online pharmacy and enforcing the ban order in full, is also very difficult for the government
 centre sarkaar ne sunwaayee ke dauraan court ko bataaya ki kuch cametiyon kaa gathan kiya gaya he, jo is par vichaar kar rahi hai internet par bechi jane vaali dawaaen logon tak online pahunchaana kitna surakshit he
 However, the central government said that 6 months' time is needed so that a proper decision can be taken in this direction
 court ab is maamle main agali sunwaayee 9 may ko karegaa

 Former CIA officer and currently working at the prestigious Brookings Institute, Bruce Reidel said, "david Headley's confession tells us that the Mumbai attack was hatched by lashkar-e-taiba and how deep it has links with al-qaeda and perhaps even the Pakistan Army
" 
 ’haal hi main sheersh bhartiya adhikariyon ne kaha tha ki hedli se poochtacha ke dauraan mumbai hamalon main iesai kii sanliptata ke bare main saboot mili hai
 To this, Reidel said, "there is no excuse for lashkar-e-taiba and its leading organizations for not taking strict action by the Government of Pakistan and for not 'cleaning' the Pakistani Army
" ’unhone kaha ‘‘agar hedli kaa kahana sahi he to pakistani sena kii aisi tasviir ubhartee he jisamen vah aatankwaad main sahyog kar rahi he or isse hamaare sarvaadhik mahatvapurn sahyogi tathaa bharat ke parmaanu sampann padosi ko lekar chaunkaane vaale sawaal uthte hai

 Gurjit's cook from 'aaj Tak' spoke to Amit Bahadur, the cook of Rana Gurjit in this whole matter, and he said that he has neither been Rana Gurjit's cook nor his cabinet minister in Punjab It has nothing to do with Rana Gurjeet Singh

 unhone kaha ki unka ret kii khaanon kii biding se kuch bhi lenaa-dena nahin he
 If a person named Amit Bahadur has bid heavily and got a tender of sand mines, he has no role in it
 unhen ye bhi jaankaree nahin he ki amit bahadur naam kaa vyakti kab unka karmchaaree rahaa tha or unki company main aise bahut se karmchaaree kaam karte hai
 The order given by the Captain for judicial inquiry, currently the politics on this whole matter has been completely hot
 aam aadmi party ne rana gurjeet ke istife kii maang kii he or ret kii khaanon kii boli kii jaanch karwaane kii maang kii he
 Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh has also ordered the judicial inquiry into the auction of sand mines, realizing the seriousness of this whole matter, but it does not seem that this earthquake in the politics of Punjab is going to stop

 The rhetoric on the Rafael case is reaching a very low level
 rafel maamle par rahul gandhi ne france ke purv raashtrapati oland ke bayaan ke baad kaha ki france ke purv raashtrapati ne hamaare piem ko chor kaha he
 
 phir kya tha soshal media par pradhanmantri kaa majaak banaaya jane laga
 
 soshal media par meraa piem chor he jaise jumalon kii baadh aa gai 
 
 vahaan par jaise maano ki chor-chor kaa shor hone laga
 
 
 The Union Law Minister has even said that Rahul Gandhi is shameless and irresponsible
 
 
 yahi nahin prasad ne aage kaha ki hamaara aarope he ki rahul gandhi ke parivaar ko kamishan nahin mila isliye rafel deal ko dubaara 2012 main kiya gaya
 Rahul Gandhi's family does not work without commission whether it is Bofors, 2G or coal scam
 bijepi ko is baat kaa gussa he ki piem ko chor kyon bataaya ja rahaa he
 Randeep Surjewala of Congress responded to Ravi Shankar Prasad
 unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar kaa naam badalakar modi baba chalis chor rakh dena chahie or ravishankar prasad aaropon kaa jawaab gaali se de rahe hai
 Surjewala said that the Modi government is hiding under the cover of Pakistan
 tender hi 2012 main khulaa to 2008 kii baat kaise? ek jhooth chhipaane ke liye bahut chhot bolne padate hai
 Also Surjewala raised the question whether Modi is Ambani's PM or the country? magar bhartiya raajnneeti main pradhanmantri ko chor kahana koi nai baat nahin he
 We have a terrible history of calling PM a thief
 saal 2013 main tab ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko chor bolaa gaya
 During the UPA government, PM Chor Hai hash tag ran a lot
 bijepi iti cell kii taraf se twit kiya gaya ki kal puraa desh jaan jayega ki hamaara piem chor he
 BJP leader Meenakshi Lekhi had written that PM is a thief, no this government is a procession of thieves, bhashtra, helpless, puppet PM
 
 
 ab thode or peeche chalate hai
 
 rajeev gandhi ke samay jab boforce kaa maamla aayaa tha tab vipaksh ne naaraa diya tha ki gali-gali main shor he, rajeev gandhi chor he
 But now when the situation is changing, Ravi Shankar Prasad is feeling the same slogan
 sabase bada sawaal he ki muddon par baat kyon nahin ho rahi he
 If the allegations are being made then why does the government not make all those documents public
 sarkaar kyon nahin kahati ki wo rafel par shwet patr laane ke liye taiyaar he
 This is where a situation of suspicion arises, is anything being hidden? The statement of former President of France Hollande has done the right thing
 tippaniyan Things have become such that one party holds a press conference, charges something, another comes up with an allegation within an hour
 
 
 bhartiya raajnneeti ke is kaajal kii kothri ke yug main sab ek-duusare ko kaalikh pot rahe hai or chor sabit karne par tule hai
 
 magar sawaal phir bhi vahi rahegaa ki jab france sarkaar yaa desalt company kii taraf se yah baar-baar kaha ja rahaa he ki unki baat to hindustan eronotics limited se ho rahi thi, aakhir ye sauda ek nijee company ko kaise chalaa gaya, jise kisi bhi tarah ke hathiyaar banane kaa koi anubhav nahin he

 kendriya kanoon mantri ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki rahul gandhi besharm or gairjimmedaar hai
 
 
 Not only this, Prasad further said that our allegation is that the family of Rahul Gandhi did not get commission, hence the Rafale deal was done again in 2012
 rahul gandhi kaa parivaar bina kamishan kaam nahin karata chaahe wo boforce ho, 2ji ho yaa koyala ghotaalaa ho
 BJP is angry about why PM is being called a thief
 ravishankar prasad ko jawaab diya congress ke randeep surajevaala ne
 He said that the name of Modi government should be changed to Modi Baba Chalis Chor and Ravi Shankar Prasad is abusive of the allegations
 surajevaala ne kaha ki modi sarkaar pakistan kii aad main chup rahi he
 Tender opened in 2012, so how about 2008? There is a lot of leeway to hide a lie
 saath hi surajevaala ne sawaal uthaaya ki modi ambani ke piem hai yaa desh ke? But in Indian politics, calling the Prime Minister a thief is not new
 hamaare yahaan piem ko chor bolne kaa ek gairavshaalee itihaas rahaa he
 In 2013, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was called a thief
 upie sarkaar ke samay piem chor he hesh tag khub chalaa
 On behalf of the BJP IT cell, it was tweeted that tomorrow the whole country will know that our PM is a thief
 bhaajapa netaa minakshi lekhi ne likhaa tha ki piem chor he, nahin yah sarkaar choron kii baraat he, bhashtra, helpalace, papet piem
 
 
 Now let's go a little further
 
 When the case of Bofors came up during Rajiv Gandhi, the opposition slogan was that there is noise in the street, Rajiv Gandhi is a thief
 magar ab jab halaat palat rahe hai to ravishankar prasad ko yahi naaraa nagavar lag rahaa he
 The biggest question is why the issues are not being discussed
 yadi aarope lag rahaa he to sarkaar un sabhi dastavejon ko saarvajanik kyon nahin karti
 Why doesn't the government say that it is ready to bring a white paper on Rafael
 yahi to sanshay kii sthiti paidaa hoti he, kya kuch chupaaya ja rahaa he? rahi sahi kasar france ke purv raashtrapati oland ke bayaan ne puri kar di he
 The comments halaat ye ho gaye hai ki ek party press conference karti he, kuch iljaam lagaati he, doosraa ghante bhar ke bheetar nayaa aarope lekar aa jaataa he
 
 
 In this era of Kajal's closet in Indian politics, everyone is sootting each other and trying to prove a thief
 
 But the question will still remain the same, when it is being repeatedly asked by the French government or Dassault Company that they were talking to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, how did the deal go to a private company, which any There is no experience of making such weapons

 The Congress has to decide whether to give Jayas a ticket in the Lok Sabha or not

 agar es nahin hota he to jais dhar, khargon, ratlam-jhabua or baitool se apane nirdaleey ummidavaar utaaregi'

 Forty years later, India's most popular villain, Prakash Raj, is all set to play this character in the remake of the film
 ajit kii style sattar ke dashak ke anukool thi
 But today it will not work
 raaj kehete hai, ''aaj nafasat kaa idia puri tarah badal chukaa he-safed-suut or waite 69 chalan se baahar najar aate hai
 Instead, today's villain drinks single malt and wears Armani's clothes
 ''ve din gaye, jab shakti kapur or gulshan grover ke chehron par kai nishaan hote the or ve sandigdh harakatein karte the
 Today's villain is the honest-looking IB chief Bhaskaran who conducts a terrorist attack on the Kolkata Metro (story), the wicked colonel of the ISI, who smuggles an atomic bomb from Latvia (agent Vinod), leader Jayakant Shirke who a policeman does everything to bring Singham to the ground (singham) or diamond merchant Dharmesh Jhaveri, who is also an illegal arms dealer and has sincere special animosity (B E-money)
 miliye, bhartiya cinema ke nae daur ke villen se
 These villains have brains, rather than patchworkers clinging to one eye
 ve aapako rijhaate hai, apane mohpash main faansate hai, un par bharosa karne kaa aapako mauka dete hai or phir mauka aane par aapako gachha de jate hai
 Demonstrating the real-life villains of today, the villains of Bollywood are apparently ordinary people who scam the banks, are don, money launder, crook policemen, corrupt politicians and double agent spies - they are all smart , Are gentle white-collar criminals, about whom we often hear in the news
 film nirmaataa mahesh bhatta kehete hai, ''vaastavik jivan main achche or bure ke bich kaa antar dhundhala pad gaya he or ab isi kaa asar filmi duniya par pad rahaa he, jisase aise asardaar or chaunkaane vaale kirdaar gadhe ja rahe hai, jinase film kii kahani aage badhaane main madad milti he
 "and all these Villain Khanty are professional - that is, their only purpose in the film is not to kill, rob and laugh devilishly
" ve hero ko chunauti dete hai, (sirf shaareerik rup se nahin), kisi kii bhi haddiyon tak ko kampa dete hai or saraasar asli lagate hai
 The directors have realized the importance of the role of the villain, and most of the villain gets as much chance on screen as the hero
 66 varshiya bangla abhinayta dhritiman chatarji agent vinod main aantki sanghathanon ke saath kaam karne vaale aadhe-adhure british lahaze vaale vyapaaree jagdishwar metla bane hai
 He says, "just as the male lead of the film is now called the lead actor, not the 'hero', his opponent is now called a 'negative character' rather than a villain, who is painted in the color of evil
 it happens
 ''aaj ke bollywood ke villenon main nayaa naam jananath-2 ke mangal singh tomars naam ke kirdaar kaa he, jise 43 varshiya manish choudhary ne nibhaayaa he
 Tomar is a religious Haryanvi grain exporter and an illegal arms dealer behind the scenes
 apane karmchaariyon ko itmeenaan se goliyon se uda dene ke baad vah bhagwaan kaa naam ('jai maa yudheshwari') letaa he or apni subah kii puja jari rakhata he
 Filmmaker Sujoy Ghosh, who played the role of IB chief Bhaskaran (also played by Chatterjee) in his thriller film Kahani, says that no rocket science was used to create the character, as his attempt to make it as realistic as possible Had to keep close to ve kehete hai, ''jab villen kii baat aati he, to yah kargar hota he ki vah everej, middle class yaa apper middle class kaa vyakti ho jo kisi ko nuksaan na pahunchane vaala najar aata ho, lekin nafis vyaktitv kaa ek kaala paksh hota ho
 These are people who go to high levels and play a very scary game
 ''agent vinod main dusht karnal kii bhoomika nibhaane vaale 49 varshiya abhinayta adil hossain maanate hai ki kirdaar gadhane ke maamle main bhartiya patakatha lekhak or film nirmaataa ab pashchimi film nirmaataaon kii tarah sochane lage hai
 He says, "this is largely the view of the acting school of (russian filmmaker) Lee Strasbourg, which is associated with the realistic style of filmmaking
 ''hossain kaa karnal kirdaar ek payalat ke bhes main hota he or vah dusht iesai karnalon ke ek samooh ke liye kaam karata he, jo bharat par hamale kii yojana bana rahe hote hai
 In creating such complex characters, it becomes important that who will play that role
 film nirmaataa ab aise abhinaytaon kii khoj main hai, jinke chehre mukhyadhara ke cinema main khaas jane-pahachaane na hon
 Kunal Deshmukh, director of Jannat-2, says, "I selected Manish Chaudhary for the role of Mangal Singh on the basis of his acting and not on the basis of glamor
 ''tarika yah he ki kirdaar ke liye kam lokapriy abhinayta ko chunaa jaae taaki abhinayta se zyada lokapriyata kirdaar kii ho
 Ghosh says, "I chose Dhritiman as Bhaskaran, because his image on the screen is not that of a man carrying the burden of evil
 darshakon main se kai log unhen nahin jaanate the or is vajah se film ant tak romaanchak bani rahi
 "chatterjee feels very happy that now slowly, but solidly, Indian films are getting out of the habit of relying on a 'star' for success
" kisi film main ab uski kahani or iske charitra zyada ahm ho rahe hai
 Chaudhary owes his role to a bad boss in Rocket Singh Quaselsman of the Year, as he got his dream role in the film Blood Money

 ’ a long journey of 27 years on the big screen, many superhit films during this time, but now it seems that the magic of 'baazigar' of Bollywood is not affecting the public
 king of romance kii pichhali 6 filmein uthaakar dekhie to unamem se 5 box offis par buree tarah flop hui hai
 It is also a matter of concern that films like Zero, Jab Harry Met Sejal, Raees and Fan, some of which were budgeted well, also fell at the box office
 soshal media par pichley kaaphi vakt se aise gocips shuru ho gaye hai ki superstar kaa staradam ab khatm ho chukaa he
 Zero was Shah Rukh's third consecutive flop and after this, Shah Rukh did something for the first time that he doesn't normally do
 behad biji life jeene vaale shahrukh ne kaam se brake liya or apane puure parivaar ke saath chhuttiyaan manaane chale gaye
 In an interview with Rajiv Masand, Shah Rukh said that he had not given up thinking
 to kya vaaki shahrukh kaa staradam ab dhalane laga he? kya vaaki logon ko 'mohabbatein' sikhaane vaale shahrukh se logon kaa lagaav ab ghat chukaa he? kya wo vakt aa gaya he jab shahrukh ko camera ke aage nahin balki camera ke peeche khadey hona chahie? in dinon filmon or web siries ke production kaa kaam sambhaal rahe shahrukh ke liye wo koun si chijen ho sakati hai jo unhen parde par ek baar phir se jabardast popularity dilaa sakati hai
 Let's know? 1
 content besd filmein karnashahrukh khan kii pichhali kuch filmein uthaakar dekhen to vah larger dain life kirdaar karnaa pasand karte hai
 Although in Zero, he did an out-of-the-box role of a poorly educated Dilfenk boy from Meerut, but in other films he likes to project himself as a superstar
 shahrukh yadi damdaar content vaali filmein uthaaen to shaayad baat ban sakati he
 The new era is of content and the same films are getting hit on screen which have life in their content
 2
 There is no doubt that acting magic has been shown for a long time and there is a doubt in their acting
 haalanki unki pichhali kuch filmon main koi bhi aisa kirdaar nahin dikhaa jo darshakon ke jehan par apni chhap chhod jaae
 Shah Rukh has his own production house and apparently he gets a lot of scripts everyday
 shahrukh ko ab aisi script uthaane kii jarurat he jo is daur main out of da box hon
 3
 ek se zyada madhyamon par kaam karnashahrukh ke production main ban rahi web siries board of blad in dinon khub charchaa main he
 Emraan Hashmi is in the lead role in the series and Shahrukh will not be seen in this series
 shahrukh sirf bade parde par najar aate hai or ye bhi ek badi dikkat he
 While stars like Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh and Amitabh Bachchan are connecting with the audience on the small screen, Shah Rukh only appears on the big screen
 haalanki bich bich main shahrukh tivi ke liye ek do sho lekar aae hai, lekin wo amitabh aamir or salmaan ke shoj (kebisi, satyamev jayate or big bos) jaise prabhavi sho nahin rahe
 4
 soshal image par kaam karne jarurat haishahrukh ke staradam ko jis cheez se sabase zyada prabhavit kiya he wo he unki negative image
 In the last few years, there have been many incidents that have affected Shahrukh's image to an extent
 dikkat kii baat ye he ki shahrukh ne apni image ko hill karne ke liye zyada kuch nahin kiya
 While Salman has been working continuously
 salmaan or aamir ne phans ke bich ek alag hi image gen kiya he
 5
 byopic or real life besd filmein karanaabhi byopic or real life cinema kaa vakt he
 Such films are becoming box office hits which are either based on the Satya incident or are someone's biopic
 shahrukh khan ne pichley dinon rakesh sharma kii byopic film ko naa kah diya tha
 Whereas he needs to work on such films like Akshay Kumar
 aisi filmon se jahaan darshak sidhetor par conect ho jate hai balki aisi filmon ke dekhne ke liye cinemagharon main bhi pahunchate hai
 a new celebrity is in discussion today at the Zoological Park in Udaipur

 The specialty of this tiger is that it understands only Tamil
 ab usamen hindi or rajasthani kii bhi samaj viksit karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The white tiger Rama has been brought from Vandalur zoo in Chennai to Sajjangarh Zoological Park in Udaipur city, Rajasthan
 is safed baagh ke badale main tamilnadu ko bhediyon kaa joda diya gaya he
 When Rama was brought to Udaipur, it came to know that it neither understands Hindi nor Rajasthani
 samasya yah thi ki yah tamil main aadesh milane par hi unka paalan karata tha
 The comments udaipur main paanch saal ke rama kii dekhbhaal kii jimmedaari sambhaal rahe ram singh ke liye 'tamil bhashi' baagh ko sanbhaalanaa chunauteepurn tha
 Rama may have been born in Delhi, and is now in Udaipur, but he was raised in Chennai, and so naturally his language is Tamil
 aakhirkaar chennai se chelaiya ko bulaayaa gaya, jinhone rama kii parvarish kii he
 Chellaiah followed Rama to whatever he said in Tamil after reaching Udaipur
 lekin chelaiya yahaan hameshaa to rah nahin sakate
 To solve this problem, he taught Ram, the new caretaker of Rama, some Tamil
 21 din main rama nae maahaul main dhal gaya he
 Now he has started to understand something of Ram Singh's North Indian Tamil
 ram singh kaa kahana he ki "isko hindi bhashaa nahin aati
 It had to be explained in Tamil language
 jaise 'sapadahia' matlab khaanaa khaanaa, 'po' matlab baahar janaa, 'va' matlab andar aana
 
 
 Now it has become friendly
 kuch hindi bhi samajhane laga he jaise rama
 
 rama
 
 bolenge to aa jaataa he
 " lagata he rama ne jald hi vah baadha dur kar legaa jo uttar or dakshin ke kai log dur karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 She will begin to understand both Hindi and Tamil

 a large crowd is gathering to see him
 rama ke alaava philhal rajasthan ke paas sirf ek or safed baagh he jo ki jaipur main he
 Ram Singh, who is responsible for the care of five-year-old Rama in Udaipur, was challenged to handle the 'tamil-speaking' tiger
 rama paidaa bhale hi dilli main hua, or ab udaipur main he, lekin uski parvarish to chennai main hi hui he, or isliye swaabhaavik rup se uski bhashaa tamil he
 Eventually, Chelliah was summoned from Chennai, who raised Rama
 chelaiya ne udaipur pahunchane ke baad rama ko tamil main jo bhi kaha, usne uskaa paalan kiya
 But Chelliah cannot live here forever
 is samasya ko sulajhane ke liye unhone rama ke nae care tekar ram singh ko kuch tamil sikhaai
 In 21 days, Rama has changed into a new environment
 ab vah ram singh kii uttar bhartiya tamil kuch samajhane laga he
 Ram Singh says that "it does not know Hindi language
 isko tamil bhashaa main samajhaana padataa tha
 Like 'sapdahiya' means eating food, 'po' means going out, 'and' means coming in
 
 
 ab yah friendli ho gaya he
 Some Hindi is also understood like Rama
 
 Rama
 
 If you speak, it comes
 " It seems that Rama will soon overcome the obstacle which many people of North and South are not willing to overcome
 use hindi or tamil donon samaj aane lagengi
 Looks like Udaipur transfer from Chennai will give Rama a lot of fame
 use dekhne ke liye kaaphi bheed jute rahi he
 Apart from Rama, Rajasthan currently has only one more white tiger which is in Jaipur
 lagata he rama ne jald hi vah baadha dur kar legaa jo uttar or dakshin ke kai log dur karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 She will begin to understand both Hindi and Tamil
 lagata he chennai se udaipur transfar rama ko kaaphi shoharat degaa

 For the first time in the 66-year history of Pakistan, a democratically elected government has completed five years
 yah or bhi badi uplabdhi isliye he ki aisa kanoon or vyavastha kii gambhir samasyaon, kharaab aarthik sthitiyon or usase bhi adhik pradhan nyaayadhish iftikhar ali choudhary ke soche-samajhe paagalpan ke baavjood hua he jo pakistan piples party (pipipi) ke varisht netaaon ko sajaa dene par utaaru lagate hai
 It is now largely decided that if there is no surprise incident suddenly, the next election for Parliament will be held on May 11, 2013
 lekin kya pakistan in chunaavon ke liye taiyaar he? ek nae chunaav ayog kaa gathan ho chukaa he or 1970 ke baad pehali baar matadaata suchiyaan taiyaar hai, lekin kanoon, vyavastha or booth kabje jaise mudde abhi vyavastha kii aajamaaish kar sakate hai
 According to the estimates so far, it is almost certain that the coalition government will take over the reins of the country
 do sabase bade dal-pipipi or muslim lig (navaj) puri tarah taiyaar dikhte hai or agar is paaramparik dharna ko sahi maane ki adhiktar matadaata pehle kii tarah hi vot denge to punjab main navaj sharif kii party kaa palada baari he
 The PPP may be in bad shape in north and central Punjab, but it can benefit in the south and retain its traditional stronghold of Sindh
 agar imran khan kii taharik-e-insaaf party ko 30 or 50 ke bich siten mil gayi to navaj ko nuksaan hoga
 The seats of the uprooted northwestern border province will meet the banknotes
 phir bhi sabase ahm mudda yah he ki kya is chunaav se pakistan main sthaayee or tikaoo loktantr sthapit hoga yaa yah rasta anischitataaon se bharaa he
 Will another elected government complete its term? Will religious fundamentalist forces or military allow it to succeed? We wish well, but looking at the history of this young country, this question is bound to arise
 11 agast, 1947 ko kaayade-ajam ne pakistan ko dharmanirpeksh desh ghoshit kiya tha
 "you are free, free to go to your temples
" 
 
 apni masjidon main jane ke liye aaazaad hai
 
 
 Over time, Hindus and Hindus will cease to be Muslims
 
 
 unki siyaasi haisiyat desh ke naagarik kii hogi
 "he wished for a modern Islamic, but secular and democratic nation, because in his eyes, when Muslims found their country, all the reasons for nationalist communalism had died
" lekin dukh kii baat yah he ki jinna ke sapane kii jagah jeet moulana maududi kii islamic vichaardhaara kii hui
 The emphasis was on establishing a monopoly of Islamic rule, which was reflected in the objective resolution passed in 1951, in which Pakistan was declared an Islamic republic
 yah pehla muslim desh he, jiske naam main dharmik pahchaan judi he
 One thing has remained the same in all governments of Pakistan
 ve desh kii janata ko lagaataar hindu bharat ke khauf kii ghutti pilaati rahi hai
 Every president, from General Ayub Khan, has added ghee to this fire
 yah sochi-samajhi or lagaataar chalane vaali chaal he, jiskaa makasad logon ko sarkaar kii takat or videshi paise or hathiyaar, donon kii madad lene kii vaidhata samajhaana rahaa he
 It was started by wazir-e-azam Liaquat Ali, when he visited America for the first time in 1951, seeking a hand of friendship
 yahia khan, bhutto, jiya or uske baad tamaam netaaon ne yah silsilaa jari rakhaa
 But the mask of Islam's need for the survival of the country and the fear raised for India has proved very dangerous for Pakistan
 isane na sirf islamic kattarwadi takaton ko majbootee di, balki fouj ko bhi majboot kiya
 Any new government, imposed for the last 60 years, will have to face this challenge
 agar agali sarkaar ko apana paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa karnaa he to beshak use loktantr kii jaden gahari kerani hongi
 Then what will be the status of the army? Is the Pakistani army leaving its unbridled strength and ready to sit quietly in the cantonments? The military is the largest and most powerful trading bloc in Pakistan
 zyaadaatar kaarobaaron or bahut badi jameen par uskaa kabja he, jise samay-samay par uske karkunon ko tohfe main diya jaataa rahaa he
 Will the army not interfere if there is a further crisis on the economy? Some people who monitor Pakistan claim that it is difficult to overthrow the government without any concrete reason
 mujhe lagata he ki dhahati arthvyavastha or kanoon or vyavastha kii bigadati haalat ek baar phir in naakaabil civillians ko kaabo karne ke liye dakhal dene ke paryaapt kaaran ban sakati hai
 Hopefully Pakistan will continue this love affair with democracy despite all the difficulties

 Maybe a reflection of what's going on in my own mind
 This year everytime i looked at you i have been constantly overwhelmed because the thoughts coming back to me are 'be wise, be humble, be calm, be kind, be strong because there's a power inside you and you have to spend it, share it, spread it' i will walk the path of my soul, change my destiny, make my karma
 Grateful beyond words to gannu and the universe for this life, for the opportunity to be truly alive and align myself to the higher purpose
 Gannu i am one with you and will continue to walk on your path
 On good days and bad

 It is often heard in India and other Asian countries that the time has come for a second Green Revolution
 yah ekadam bhraamak baat he, kyonki krishi main aglaa kadam 1960 ke dashak ke madhya main hui harith kranti ke mukaable kahin zyada jatil, kharchila or samay lene vaala hoga
 The beginning of the Green Revolution was relatively easy
 yah sinchai, gramin bijli or sadakon ke maamle main punjab, haryana, pashchim uttar pradesh ke pehle se hi unnat jilon or dakshin-purv ke tateey kshetron main faili
 In addition, due to the consolidation of fields in the northwest, demand for private tubewells operated by electricity was increasing rapidly

 The traditional yield of wheat (1,200 kg-per-hectare) jumped and doubled and later it increased to 3,500-4,000 kg per hectare
 haalanki dakshin-purv main chaaval kii vruddhi samaan thi
 Then in the northwest, the crop doubled due to irrigation of wheat and then rice
 1966 main (1965 or 1966 main bheeshan sookhe ke kaaran) anaaj kaa aayaat ek karod ton se girakar 1977 main lagbhag shunya rah gaya
 India has since become an exporter of grain

 In the Green Revolution districts, daily wages and non-agricultural jobs also increased significantly, benefiting the landless people

 Why are there so many poor and malnourished people despite these successes? The alarm bell was heard for the first time around 1980

 Due to lack of government investment and continued expenditure, the supply of electricity began to decrease and the condition of roads became bad, the complaint of which is heard even today

 Actually, those who played the role of terrorists in mock drill were shown as Muslims
 unhen muslim topi pahanaai gai or islam jindabad, kashmir lekar rahenge, narmada lekar rahenge ke naare lagavaaye gaye
 It is clear from this kind of action that the police Surat and Narmada police look at the Muslims

 sawaal uth rahe hai ki kya gujarat police bhi yahi maanati he ki muslim hi aatankwaadi hote hai, agar nahin to phir aatanki ko muslim hi kyon dikhaaya or kyon islam jindabad ke naare lagavaaye gaye
 It is not that the police has done this only once
 narmada jile kii police ne mock drill main jis tarah islam ko aatankwaad se joda usee tarah se surat police ne bhi dharm ko aatankwaad se jod diya
 In Narmada, slogans of Islam Zindabad were chanted and in Surat an Islamic cap was worn on the heads of the policemen
