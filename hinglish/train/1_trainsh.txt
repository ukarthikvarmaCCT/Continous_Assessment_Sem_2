 India play their first day-night Test at the Eden Gardens from Friday
 Hard to understand wrist spinners with a pink ball
 Senior off-spinner Harbhajan Singh believes that the Eden Gardens has more than the pink ball finger finger spinners in the milky light
 The spinners' ball will be more difficult to understand
 bharat apana pehla bahupratikshit din-raatri test bangladesh ke khilaaf eden gardens main shuukravaar se khelegaa or ise lekar kaaphi utsukata he ki gulabi gend kaisaa bartaav karegi
 Harbhajan told PTI, 'if you look at the wrist spinners are in a position of advantage, because it is very difficult to see the seam (due to the black thread) in the pink ball
 ’ bharat ke paas kuldeep yadav ke rup main kalai kaa spinner he, lekin harbhajan chayan maamalon par baat nahin karnaa chaahate
 Harbhajan said, 'this will be the decision of the team management and i cannot comment
 lekin isse pehle bangladesh ko tej gendbaaji kii anukool pich par bhartiya gendbaajon kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 "he said," and at the same time everyone knows that fast bowlers do the most damage during the sunset in Kolkata between three and a half to four and a half
 lekin agar hamen bhavishya main adhik din-raatri ke match khilne hai to spinneron ko lekar adhik jaankaree jutaney kii jarurat he
 Harbhajan reminded how dangerous Kuldeep had become with the pink ball in the 2016 Duleep Trophy
 unhone kaha, ‘agar aapako dilip trophy yaad he to koi bhi kalai se kuldeep kii gend ko prabhavi tareeke se nahin samaj paa rahaa tha
 In that tournament, leg-spinners got a lot of wickets
 ’unhone bataaya ki aakhir kalai ke spinner kyon adhik prabhavi honge
 Harbhajan said, "when the finger spinner bowls, the ball is released along the seam, so that it gives turn and bounce
" jab aap gugali karte ho, to seem ko samajhnaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Harbhajan, however, said spinners like Muttiah Muralitharan can be quite effective with the pink ball
 bharat ke achche spinneron main se ek harbhajan ne kaha, ‘lekin muthaiya muralidharan jaise apwaad ho sakate hai, jo anguli kaa spinner hone ke baavjood khatarnaak ho sakate hai
 The pink SG ball, however, can be a challenge for the spinners, as an extra layer of color has been applied to retain its color in the milky light

 Delhi High Court has ordered an inquiry against passport officials for wrongly issuing the passport of Sushil Ansal, the owner of the gift cinema

 The Delhi High Court said during the hearing today that when the whole world knew that Sushil Ansal was the main accused in the gift case, how did the passport officials issue him a new passport without the approval of the court
 court ne videsh mantralay ko nirdesh diya he ki 4 hafte main apni jaanch kii report court ko saunpe
 Neelam Krishnamurthy filed a petition in the Delhi High Court against the petitioner Ansal, who had lost her two children in the gift case, stating that the new passport was obtained illegally by giving false information

 But the problem with alcohol is that its furnace can be found anywhere in any hut

 "A liquor contractor in Delhi says that the keen eye of the Election Commission has made the movement of liquor difficult

 agar ummidavaar ko tikat milane kaa puraa bharosa ho or vah bahut pehle se kharch shuru kar de to uske kharch kaa hisaab lagane kaa koi tarika nahin he
 It is also difficult to distinguish between the expenses incurred by the party or the candidate

 According to trustee Jagdeep Chokar, founder of the Association for Democratic Reforms, when the spending limit in the 2009 election was Rs 40 lakh
 thi tab 6,753 ummidavaaron ke kharch sambandhi halafnaamon se pataa chalaa ki sirf chaar ne seemaa se adhik kharch kiya tha
 Not only this, 6,719 candidates made Rs 22,00,000

 This is not bad for the health of the economy but is it good for democracy? You keep calculating dattatreya jayanti (dattatreya Jayanti) ko dutt jayanti (datta Jayanti 2019) ke namase bhi janaa jaataa he
 It is a festival of Hindus, which is celebrated to commemorate the birth of Lord Dattatreya
 bhagwaan dattatreya ko brahma, vishnu or shiv kaa avatar manaaya jaataa he
 Dattatreya was the son of Atri and Anusuya and was born in the Pradosh period
 bhagavaana dattatreya ko ''smritimatranuganta'' or ''smartrugami'' bhi kaha jaataa he kyonki vah smaranmaatr karne par hi apane bhakton ke paas pahunch jate hai
 Lord Dattatreya is believed to have received education from 24 Gurus
 brahmanon kii is shart ko sun kar anusuya kaaphi chintit ho gayi or phir vah apane tapobal se brahmanon kii satyata jaan gayi
 After remembering Lord Vishnu and her husband Atri, Anusuya said that if her husbandhood religion is true, all three Brahmins should become 6-month-old babies
 anusuya ne apane tapobal se tridevon ko shishu bana diya or phir apni god main lekar dugdhpan karaayaa or teenon ko paalane main rakh diya
 On the other hand, the three deities were worried about their husbands not coming back
 tab naarad ji unke paas pahunche or sara ghatnakram bataaya
 After this, the three ladies regretted their actions
 iske baad teenon deviyon ne anusuya se maafee maangi or apane patiyon ko mul swaroop main laane kaa aagrah kiya
 Anusuya then brought the Tridevas from their Tapobal to their former form
 iske baad tridev ne unase vardaan maangane ko kaha or tab anusuya ne un teenon devon ko putr swaroop main paane ke kii maang rakhi
 After this Dattatreya was born from the womb of Mata Anusuya and hence it is said that worshiping Lord Dattatreya brings blessings of the three gods

 ek anokhe surveykshan main yah baat saamne ai he ki ek bank luteraa ek eemaandaar vyakti kii tulana main kahin ‘kam’ kamai kar paata he
 Researchers at the University of Sussex and Surrey analyzed the bank robbers' earnings in Britain in this unprecedented survey of their kind
 visheshgyon kaa daawa he ki aam luteraa ausatan 12,706 pound lootakar bhaagta he, jo kisi eemaandaar karmchaaree ko ausatan chah maheene main milane vaale vetan se kam hi hota he
 Although it is shown on TV that the robbers are running away with bags full of notes, while in reality they return empty handed from one of the three banks
 daily mail kii ek report ke anusaar luteron ko police dwaara ucch takneekee upkarnon dwaara pakade jane kaa khatra rahata he
 At the same time, long prison sentences are also given by the court if caught
 tathyon ke anusaar agar koi luteraa apni mali haalat sudhaarney ke liye lagaataar kai bank luutata he, to ausatan chauthi lut ke baad vah pakadaa jaataa he or jail main daal diya jaataa he
 Researchers gathered many bizarre data from the British Bankers Association about how much was looted and how many weapons were used
 adhyayankartaaon ne paaya ki britain main dakaitiyon me ausatan 20,331 pound luute gaye or luteron kii sankhya ke hisaab se har sadsy ko 12,706 pound mili hai
 According to the survey, the robbers who carry out the robbery with weapons collect more goods, the larger the gang is, the more the spoils are
 atirikt sadsy ke aane par lut kii kul rakam ausatan 9,033 pound bad jaati he, kintu har lutere ko milane vaala hissaa ghat jaataa he
 Researchers also tested safety parameters such as working from alarms to staff
 suraksha kii drushti se lagaai gai screen ke kaaran lut kii ghatnaon main ek-tihaai tak kami ai, lekin atyadhik mahange hone ke kaaran britain ke 10 main se ek hi bank main yah screen lagi hui thi
 Professor Neil Rickman of the University of Surrey said that this research shows that robbing a bank is not a profitable deal

 The answer to the question of whether there is an advantage in committing a crime depends on your view whether such a risk can be taken for a sum of £ 20,331
 vaise unhone kaha, ‘mujhe vishwaas he ki yah aparaadhiyon ke us samooh ke liye phaayde kaa sauda he jo apane kaam ko anjaam dene ke liye kadi mehnat karte hai or bade peshevraana andaaj main apane kaam ko anjaam dete hai

 The Congress, which is dreaming of defeating the BJP by taking Mayawati along in the assembly elections of three states, has suffered a major setback
 gathbandhan ke saare daawey hawa ho gaye
 Now the Congress has been forced to take a single front from the BJP in these states on its own
 haalanki, congress sutron ke mutabik, aaj ke halaat main aisa hone ke hi asaar the, lekin 2019 ke aam chunaavon main mayawati ke saath kaa vikalp, vah ab bhi khulaa maanati he
 According to Congress sources, due to pressure from the investigating agencies of the Central Government, the possibility of alliance with Mayawati in three states was slim
 vaise party kii rajasthan ikai gathbandhan ke paksh main nahin thi, lekin madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main party basapa se gathjod chaahati thi
 Meanwhile, party sources say that as soon as Mayawati made a pact with Ajit Jogi in Chhattisgarh, the party strategists felt that the matter was different
 yani empi main bhi baat nahin banane vaali
 According to sources, when Mayawati sought seats in Madhya Pradesh, there were about half of those seats where the contest between the congress-bjp has taken place
 aise main un siton ko basapa ko dene se bijepi kii jeet pakki ho sakati thi
 In such a situation, the Madhya Pradesh Congress told the high command that perhaps Mayawati is under the pressure of the BJP, that is why she is keeping such conditions, which was impossible for Madhya Pradesh Congress to believe
 iske baad tay ho gaya ki empi main samjhauta sambhav nahin hoga
 Only then did Digvijay Singh openly give a statement of bjp's pressure on Mayawati
 isse biferi mayawati ne digvijay or congress ko latad lagaai
 But despite all this, the top sources of the Congress say that till the Lok Sabha elections close, the screws of the central investigative agencies will be weakened, in that case pressure on Mayawati will not work and then there is a possibility of compromise
 unke mutabik, mayawati ne apane bayaan main rahul-sonia ke gathbandhan chaahane kii baat kahkar 2019 ke liye khidki khuli rakhi he
 Congress sources also believe that the BSP does not want to form an alliance with the Congress in the three states, so that even if there is an alliance before the Lok Sabha elections, more seats can be claimed
 is puure masale par varisht congress netaa arpyen singh ne ajtak se kaha, hamaare adhyaksh pehle hi 2019 ke liye rajyavar samaan vichaardhaara vaale dalon se gathjod kii vakaalat kar chuke hai, isliye bhavishya main badi ladaai ke liye vikalp khule hai
 Also, when Mayawati ji has said that, in favor of rahul-sonia Gathjod, then for 2019 all three can sit and talk and fix whatever problems are there

 ’ The Delhi High Court on Wednesday termed the conclusion of an expert committee on the status of pesticide residues in food items as alarming, saying that Delhi's 1st
 75 karod kii kareeb samoochee aabaadi jo fal or subjiyan khaati he vah maanav upbhog ke liye thik nahin he
 a bench headed by Acting Chief Justice BD Ahmed has asked the Delhi government to set up a Pesticide Residue Management Cell under the control of the Food Commissioner within four weeks to effectively deal with the issue
 peeth ne kaha ki yah sthiti khatre kaa sanket de rahi he
 We are eating pesticides, including members of the committee that prepared the report
 peeth main nyaayamurti siddharth mridul bhi shaamil hai
 The court asked the city government and the Union Agriculture Ministry to take short-term and long-term measures to reduce losses and to make people aware of ways to deal with such situations
 visheshgy samiti ne pratibandhit kitnashkon kii falon, anaaj, subjiyon or khaane kii anya chizon main maujuudagi kam karne ke sankshipt avadhi ke upaay sujhaaye hai
 The court said that the report of the committee should be released on the government website
 nuksaan kam karne ke upaay evam tareeke dilli main bas padaavon, railway steshnon or sabji dukaanon sahit vibhinn sthanon par hindi, gurumukhi or urdu main vitarit kiya jaae or prakashit kiya jaae taaki logon ko kitnashak mudde se nipatane kii jaankaree mil sake
 Highlights- There are 800 cases filed in a week - 11 benches have 40 case lists per bench - 880 case lists in a week - 120 cases are not being listed - Hearing soon, then increase the number of benches
 Gogoine once again took a tough stand on the petitions coming before the court for early hearing and said that this is not possible in the present situation
 mukhya nyaayadhish ne kaha kisupreme courtke saamne ek hafte ke paanch kaarobaari din main 880 cese daayar hote hai
 The Chief Justice said that such a large number of incoming cases are divided into 11 benches of the court, due to which at least 40 cases come before each bench
 justise gogoi ne kaha ki supreme court main somvaar ko 440 maamle or shuukravaar ko 440 maamle sunwaayee ke liye aate hai
 Along with this, due to the large number of cases, about 120 cases are not listed in the court
 bataur mukhya nyaayadhish apana kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ke baad nyaayadhish gogoi kah chuke hai ki sabhi maamalon main jald sunwaayee kii yachika laane kaa koi auchity nahin he
 This should be done only in select cases where there is a question of someone's life and death i
e
 someone is being hanged and some party needs the intervention of the Supreme Court
 haalanki nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki supreme court hafte main sabhi 1000 cese sunne ke liye taiyaar he lekin maujuuda 11 benchon ke saath aisa kar paanaa sambhav nahin he
 Therefore, due to the increasing cases of early hearing, either the above suggestions can be given to him or the number of benches in the Supreme Court should be increased so that 1000 cases can be heard in a week

 The bill is likely to be tabled in Parliament next week
 is bill ke jariye saarvajanik or privet companiyon ke liye nijee data kii processing ko lekar kanoon laae jane kii manshaa he
 However, the bill is yet to be tabled in the House
 sutron ke mutabik, data sangrakshan main companiyon ke liye ye jaruri nahin hoga ki ve tamaam tarah ke nijee data ko bharat main hi store or process karen
 However, geographical restrictions on sensitive and critical personal data may be included in the bill
 desh main data storage suvidha kholane kii batabata den ki sarkaar ateet main google or fasebuk jaisi companiyon se bharat main apni data storage suvidha kholane ke mudde par baat karti rahi he
 The provision of access to data and its processing will only apply to data processors located outside India and will only be related to any activity to which the data principles outline will be linked to the Indian region

 Think 8 hours when the commissioner of Mumbai sits in a police station? Such a policeman happens only occasionally in the history that the head of the family himself comes and starts working as a Senior Inspector
 wo jaanch adhikari ban jaae or kadiyaan jodne lage
 The Khar police station remains the media bastion of the entire city these days
 guuruuvaar kii raat to 8 ghante chali poochtacha raat ko 10
 30 buzzes ended
 krime reporting karne waalon kii haalat buree he
 Are guarded outside the police station
 koi ardli bhi nikalataa he to unhen lagata he ki shaayad koi choti si jaankaree mil jaae
 All police sources are numb at the moment
 koi sahi khabar kaise li kar de jab kamishnar khud sara hisaab kitaab rakh rahe hai
 When the commissioner sits, his special officer is also present there
 ye log unke ishaare par kadiyaan jodne kaa kaam karte hai
 It is not that everyone is being interrogated during the investigation
 puraa kaam alag-alag team kar rahi hai
 a team is interrogating the driver
 usase jo kuch miltaa he usee ke aadhaar par indrani se sawaal jawaab hote hai
 And now the new character Sanjeev Khanna has also arrived
 indrani kaa purv pati he
 It will be asked all that Indrani and Sanjeev Khanna have sprung up till now
 aisi jaanch main police manovigyaan kaa khel bhi khel rahi he
 a police officer who is involved in the investigation has now reached the conclusion that Indrani's thinking is very vicious
 or usne jo kuch ab tak bataaya he wo kisi peshewar shaatir dimag jaisaa he
 The characters who are out in this entire investigation are constantly coming to Khar Police Station
 police kii koshish he ki ye kirdaar ab media se zyada baat na karen
 By the way, whatever is appearing in the media is coming on the police's thought line
 tippaniyan The commissioner's experience will help in this investigation
 lekin police ke mukhiya jab ek murder kii jaanch khud police stesan main jaakar karte hai to iske apane nafe nuksaan hai
 The advantage can be that the police officer will not come under the pressure of a big caretaker
 koi aisi gadabadi jaanch main nahin hogi jisase saare kiye dhare kaa bantaadhaar ho jaae
 But the damage will be to the commissioners coming and going throughout the city 
 shahar main jab shina kii maut kii jaanch ho rahi he tab usee vakt kai or krime ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, is the police commissioner's duty just a crime investigation? Or should he play equal time and just a guide? The disadvantage is that after every murder, wouldn't the public want the commissioner to intervene in a similar way?

 yani jindagi
 But just think, what if life starts becoming death itself and distributes death to others? The story of the attack in Paris is such that because the Hyatt who is accused of killing innocent people in this attack, by the name of the incident, is Hyatt
 par hayaat ko lekar maamle main ek nayaa twist aa gaya he
 In fact, the French police claim that Hayat was present on the occasion during the Paris attack
 jabaki paris se teen hajaar kilometre dur turki police kaa kahana he ki tab hayaat turki main thi
 Now how can a Hyatt be two places at once? The fog of mystery over the most wanted woman of France and the terror attack Hyatt Boumedini is so much that there is smoke in front of the world's security agencies
 achche-acchon ko ye samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki aakhir ek vakt par ek insaan ek hi saath do jagahon par kaise ho saktaa he? kyonki ek taraf to france kii police ye daawa kar rahi he ki paris main ek do pulicekarmiyon ko nishaanaa banane or hyper kaishar naam ke super market par hamale ke dauraan aatankwaadi emidy colibeli ke saath uski patni hayaat boumedini bhi maujuud thi
 On the other hand, the Turkish government, three and a half thousand kilometers from France, is saying that during the attack Coulibelli's wife Boumedini was seen and not only seen in Turkey with some other boy but also by Turkish agencies
 
 ab sawaal yahi he ki agar hamale ke dauraan boumedini turki main thi, to paris main colibeli ke saath koun tha? or agar wo koi duusari aurat thi, to phir france police ne hamalon ke dauraan boumedini ke vahaan dekhne kii baat kaise kahi? or kaise police ne boumedini ko is hamale kaa most wanted qaraar de diya?agar turki kii ye baaten or ye sisitivi footage sahi he, to phir sawaal ye uthta he ki agar wo hamale ke dauraan yani 8 or 9 janvari ko turki or syria main rahi, to phir france police use mauka-e-vaardaat par dekhne kaa daawa kaise kar rahi he? or agar wo vaaki hamalon kii gunahagaar nahin he, to phir isi hamale ke baad se apane ghar se rahasyamayi tareeke se gaayab kyon he? or sabase ahm ye ki is vakt boumedini kahaan he? zaahir he, in tamaam sawaalon ne philhal har kisi ko ulajhaa diya he
 So was the attack on Paris a joint operation of al-qaeda and ISIS? Was Mr
 Marlborough the three and a half foot jihadist commander behind it? Soon after the attack, the way its most wanted Muljim Hyatt went missing in Syria and the way France started searching for Mr
 Marlborough in the desert of Africa

 But by changing the motherboard of the Election Commission's EVM in just 90 seconds, there is a delay in inserting such secret code and any EVM can be fixed
 unhone daawa kiya ki agar gujarat chunaav main istemaal hone vaali iviem unhen 3 ghante ke liye de di jaaen to wo bijepi ko ek bhi booth nahin jeetne denge
 While cleaning the Election Commission, the Election Commission has refused to give any official response on this issue
 ayog ke mutabik is masale par 12 may ko sabhi dalon kii baithak ke baad hi bayaan diya jayega
 However, sources in the Commission have clarified that the machine used by Saurabh Bhardwaj in the House is merely a proto-type

 Nor can the motherboard of these machines be changed

 Former Bihar Chief Minister Jagannath Mishra (82) died on Monday morning
 vah apane daur ke kaddavar netaaon main se ek the
 His popularity was with Bihar nationwide
 unka vivaadon se bhi naata rahaa
 Jagannath Mishra's name came up in the much talked about fodder scam
 iske alaava press par pabandi kaa bill bhi bihar main unhone hi laayaa tha
 However, he later regretted the decision
 mukhyamantri rahete hue jagannatha mishra ne yah bill 1982 main pesh kiya tha
 The bill, called the Bihar Press Bill, was withdrawn after heavy opposition
 rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf samvedansheel lekhon ko chhapane se rokane ko lekar yah bill pesh gaya kiya tha
 There was a provision for fine along with 5 years of imprisonment
 is vidheyak ke baad police aisi koi bhi shikaayat milane par patrakaron ko giraftaar kar sakati thi
 Later, Jagannath Mishra said that he had remorse about this bill
 bataaya jaataa he ki purv mukhyamantri ne indira gandhi ko khush karne ke liye ye bill laayaa tha
 He once visited Delhi
 is dauraan unhone indira gandhi ko pareshaan dekha
 At that time, Indira's discussions with Maneka Gandhi were in full swing
 mishra ne is bill ko lekar indira se baatcheet kii thi
 Then Information and Broadcasting Minister Vasant Sathe gave them detailed information in this regard
 31 july 1982 ko bihar press bill laayaa gaya
 However, another reason for bringing this bill was that at that time there was a lot of writing against him in the newspapers
 jise lekar vah kaaphi pareshaan the
 The bill was withdrawn after continued opposition
 bataa den ki 1975 main vah pehali baar bihar ke mukhyamantri bane the
 He was the Chief Minister of Bihar for the second time in 1980 and last from 1989 to 1990
 unhen 90 ke dashak ke dauraan kendriya cabinet main bhi jagah mili thi
 Jagannath Mishra started his career as a professor and later became a professor of economics at the University of Bihar
 unki raajnneeti main kaaphi ruchi thi
 His elder brother Lalit Narayan Mishra was the railway minister
 peshawar main army skool paratalebanke hamale ke baad pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne aatank ke khilaaf antim saans tak ladane kii baat kahi he
 It is reported that Pakistan Army Chief Rahil Sharif had asked them to lift the ban on hanging of 3000 terrorists, which they have approved
 vaise mangalvaar ko huehamaleke baad sharif ne aankada 500 bataaya tha
 However, whatever the number is, the question here is of intention, as soon after Nawaz's claim came the news of the Mumbai attack accused Lashkar commander Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi's bell, which was seen in India here
 ab sawaal uthne lage ki 'war against teror' ke tahat aatankiyon ko chun-chunakar maarane kaa puraani formula chalegaa yaa phir niti main badlaav hoga?khabar yah bhi aa rahi he ki pakistan sarkaar lakhvi kii jamaanat kaa virodh karegi
 Time will tell what the future action plan will be, but if the thing turns out, some old pages will also be turned
 zikr kargil kaa bhi honi
 The discussion should also be about the news in which Sharif had a five-letter letter with Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden
 baat to us taliban kii bhi honi chahie jo pakistan main saalon se laashen gira rahaa he, phir bhi sharif ke dil main talibani ladaakon ke liye prem kam nahin hota
 One truth is that the government of Sharif does not have the strength to take any concrete steps to wipe out the terrorists, then the other aspect is that what is the intention to leave the strength? Let us know some such facts which question both Nawaz's promise and claim
 osama se paanch mulaaqatensitambar 2009 main pakistani khufia agency iesai ke purv adhikari khwaja abbaas ne sansanikhej khulaasa kiya tha
 He claimed that there were at least five meetings between the world's most wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 ye mulaakaaten 90 ke dashak main hui thim or us vakt bhi navaj pakistan ke piem hua karte the
 Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee continued to step towards peace on the trust of Juthanwaj Sharif on Kargil, but the war of India combined
 sharif hameshaa kehete rahe ki ye sab musharraf kaa kiya dharaa tha, lekin pakistan ke hi purv leftinent general shahid ajij ne kuch or daawa kiya
 If the director of ISI, Aziz believes, the whole plot was cleared by Sharif
 sharif ne 29 janvari 1999 ko kargil ke kareeb skardu main sainya thikaanon kaa daura kiya tha, jisaki tasviren bhi saamne ai thim
 In the book titled 'A soldier's Sargujasht', General Aziz wrote that the Kargil Jung conspiracy was hatched by four people

 Significantly, both the lashkar-e-jhangvi and the Taliban dominate the Punjab province of Pakistan
 yahi kaaran he ki sharif kai saalon se taliban ke saath vaarta ke pairokaar rahe hai
 Musharraf had said 'taliban's friend', former President of Pakistan and General Pervez Musharraf had at one time termed Nawaz Sharif as 'friend of Taliban'
 unhone kaha tha ki taliban brand islamic terrirism desh ke liye behad khatarnaak sabit hoga
 Charges of funding from Laden In the 90s, there was a lot of discussion about the nexus between Sharif and Laden
 pakistan or british intligence agency ke sutron ke hawaale se khabaren ain thim ki laden ne iesai ke afasaron ke saath sharif ko jitaane kii baat kahi or kareeb ek karod dollar bhi unki party ko diya tha
 Laden also told Sharif that after winning the election, his government would work towards making Pakistan a hard-line Islamic state
 baad main benazir bhutto ne bhi sharif par laden kii madad se chunaav jeetne ke aarope lagaae the
 Support to Afghan Taliban was also recognized by Pakistan on 25 May 1997, the Taliban government in Afghanistan

 tej gendbaaj jahir khan ke paanch wicket ke baavjood puchhlle ballebaajon kii saahasik pariyon se austrailia ne majboot score khadaa karne ke baad bhartiya salaami jodi ko pavilion bhejkar pehle test cricket match ke duusare din bhi kuch had tak apana palada baari rakhaa
 After Shane Watson's marathon innings of 126 runs lasting almost seven and a half hours, Australia's lower order batsmen, especially Tim Paine (92) and Mitchell Johnson (47) also did not let India breathe a sigh of relief, making it 428 runs strong
 The score was successful
 jahir ne 94 ran dekar paanch wicket liye
 India got off to a good start by Virender Sehwag (59) and Gautam Gambhir (25) and shared an 81-run stand for the first wicket but Johnson disappointed the Indian camp by sending both these dangerous batsmen to the pavilion in the gap of 25 runs
 stump ukhdane ke samay rahul dravid 21 ran par khel rahe the jabaki nitwachaman eshanth sharma ko khaataa kholana he
 Sehwag and Gambhir initially showed complete vigilance
 sahvaag haalanki adhik der tak apane tikhe tevar dikhaane se chup nahin rahe or unhone chauthe over main dag bolinger par do chauke jadkar apane haath khole
 Even after this he did not show any softness against the Australian fast bowlers and when spinner Nathan Hauritz came, sent his first two balls across the boundary line from the cover area
 unhone keval 38 gend par apana 23waan test ardhashatak puraa kiya
 New batsman Dravid opened his account in this same over of Johnson by sending a lovely cover drive from Pyari for four runs
 sahvaag haalanki ardhashatak puraa karne ke baad pehle kii tarah haaavee nahin ho paye or janson kii short pich gend par unhone cover par maaikel clark ko kaich kaa abhyaas karaayaa
 Sehwag hit ten fours in his 54-ball innings
 isse pehle austrailia ne pehle satr main kal kii tarah dhimi ballebaaji kii or 29 over main keval 71 ran banaaye
 He added 95 runs in the second season with an important 82-run partnership between Johnson and Penn in 22 overs
 watson ne subah score paanch wicket par 224 ran se aage badhaayaa chathe wicket ke liye 53 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 Watson, who got two lives yesterday, had added only two runs to his score in the morning when wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni failed to take his catch off Zaheer
 kal chotil hone vaale gendbaaj eshanth sharma aaj subah maidan par utre lekin lanbaa samay baahar bitaane ke kaaran vah pehle satr main gendbaaji nahin kar paye
 This left Dhoni with fewer options and had to resort to spinners early on
 pen kaa saath dene ke liye janson ne tufaani tevar dikhaaye or 66 gend kii apni pari main paanch chaukon ke alaava teen chakke bhi jamaaye
 He hit two off Pragyan Ojha and a six off Harbhajan Singh
 johnson ne jahir kaa chauthaa shikaar banane se pehle test cricket main 1000 ran bhi puure kiye
 Nathan Haritz (9) did not last long and Harbhajan sent him to the pavilion
 wicketiper ballebaaj pen ne bhartiya spinneron ko aasaani se khelaa or test cricket main pehla ardhashatak jadaa
 He got his life on reaching the century but despite this, he could not reach the triple digits
 pen jab 86 ran par the tab jahir kii gend par dhoni unka kaich nahin le paye the
 Penn, however, could not complete his century and Zaheer's Goodlength ball kissing his bat reached VVS Laxman in the second slip who caught him falling further
 pen ne lagbhag paanch ghante kii apni pari main 196 gend kheli tathaa 12 chauke lagaaye
 Zaheer thus took five or more wickets in the innings for the tenth time
 iske baad austrailian pari simtane main der nahin lagi
 In the next over after Penn's dismissal, Harbhajan missed the first ball of Ojha by Ben Hilfenhaus (20 not out) but on the fourth ball he managed to get Doug Bollinger caught by Ishant Sharma

 Gurmehar Kaur, a student of Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi, has returned to her hometown of Jalandhar, but her name remains in the headlines constantly
 shahid faujee afasar kii beti gurmeher ne placord ke jariye apane jo bhi vichaar vyakt kiye, unhen lekar desh main alag alag raay saamne ai
 Now, whether it is Gurmehar's latest placard not to be afraid of ABVP, or an old video in which Gurmehar is seen giving a message of peace with several placards in hand
 inamen se ek main ye bhi likhaa tha- "pakistan ne mere pita ko nahin maaraa, jang ne maaraa
 "gurmehar got to hear a lot on social media to express his opinion
 yahaan tak ki kathith taur par rape kii dhamkee bhi
 However, there was no shortage of those who supported Gurmehar
 is puure vivaad ke bich india today ne gurmeher kii maa rajvinder cor se phone par baat kar ye jaananaa chaha ki yuva beti ko is sthiti main dekh ek maa kaa dil kya kahana chahta he
 Also, what kind of challenges he faced during Gurmehar's upbringing and what kind of ideals he taught
 india today-jaananaa chaahate hai aapke vichaar or jis tarah aapane gurmeher kii parvarish kii, saath hi jis tarah ke adarsh aapane use sikhaye
 Rajwinder kaur-gurmehar was born after applying Ardas in Bangla Sahib Gurdwara, hence the name Gurmehar
 ham donon pati-patni ke liye gurmeher anmol thi
 Gurmehar started speaking very early from the age of one
 un dinon gurmeher ke pita kupwada main tainaat the
 Gurmehar will be two years old when her father used to talk on the phone, she used to say 'vande Mataram'
 gurmeher ke pita use gul-gul ke naam se bulaate the
 When he used to say on the phone that he used to sing a song, he used to sing - Soldier, Soldier
 
 
 mithi baaten bolkar dil ko chuha le gaya
 Gurmehar could not speak by stealing, so the mouse said
 gurmeharke pita ke shahid hone ke baad choti si bacchee ko ye samajhaana bahut mushkil tha ki uske papa is duniya main nahin rahe
 Whenever her father used to come home, she used to love him a lot, so she used to miss her father more
 aksar puuchhati thi ki mamma, mere papa kab aaenge
 Serial used to come in those days - because mother-in-law was also a daughter-in-law
 usamen mihir naam ke paatr kii maut ho jaati he
 But it was shown in the serial that Mihir returns a few months later
 ye dekhakar gurmeher ne kahana shuru kar diya ki mere papa bhi waapas aaenge
 This was the time when i explained to Gurmehar in a strict tone that Papa would never return, he has become a martyr
 ek maa ke liye choti bacchee ko maut ke bare main samajhaana kisi chunauti se kam nahin tha
 India Today - Some people would be offended by calling your daughter 'anti-national'
 jis tarah ke sawaal kiye ja rahe hai, un par aapkaa kya kahana he?rajvinder cor-main jaanati hum ki wo kyon shanti kii baat karti he
 She can feel this pain from within
 kyonki ek bachche ke liye uskaa pehla hero pita hota he
 You can understand the state of the child when he is confronted with the fact that the father is no longer in the world
 pre nursery skool main jab main uskaa daakhila karaane le gai to vahaan sab bacchon ke mummy-papa donon saath aae hue the
 She was also watching this Gurmehar
 usne mujhe kas kar pakad liya
 At that time i had tears in my eyes for 15-20 minutes
 yahi sochati rahi ki jab meraa ye haal he to ye sab dekh choti si gurmeher par kya biit rahi hogi
 Being a martyr's wife is not easy
 shahid kii beti hona aasaan nahin he
 If she (gurmehar) was giving a message of peace, it is because no other child has to go through all this
 gurmeher bahut jajbaati he
 Last year he sent a message of peace to all
 gurmeher ko ye aksar karibiyon yaa rishtedaaron se sunanaa padataa tha ki uske papa aise the
 They did it, they did it
 ek bachche ke dimag main nakaaratmak vichaar nahin aane chahie
 i guided him properly from a young age
 hamaare desh main log sirf simpal chizon ko samajhate hai
 An attempt should also be made to understand the depth behind it
 vyakt kiye gaye har bhav ke peeche or bhi kai bhav chupe hote hai
 Gurmehar is very positive for everything
 uski soch se nakaaratmak baaten dur rahe isliye bachapan main use 'ani frank' kaa likhaa padhane ko diya
 Films like 'life is Beautiful'
 gurmehryuddh jaisi sthiti ke parinaamon ko acchhee tarah samajhati he
 To keep away from negativity, i explained to him that war was not killed by anyone but his father
 soshal media par jo baaten kahi ja rahi hai, majaak kiye ja rahe hai wo nishchit rup se aahat karte hai
 But all these are temporary
 isliye ye myne nahin rakhata
 i explained to Gurmehar that this situation will not last forever
 ham shanti chaahate hai
 If you want peace, then you have to be ready to face all these things
 india today-pichley 48 ghante aapke liye kitne mushkil rahe or aap ek maa ke naate kaise apni beti ko aalochanaon kaa saamana karne ke liye madad kar rahi hai
 Rajwinder Kaur - To be honest, i am very hurt but i am learning from my daughter
 wo bahut majboot insaan he
 Strong girl
 meri ek dost mujhase kahati thi ki agar tumhen bhi kuch ho gaya to tumhaari beti kaa kya hoga
 Now i am fully convinced that if anything happens to me, i know that my daughter is very strong and able to take care of herself well
 india today-ek maa kii taraf se ye bahut majboot sandesh he
 Are you disappointed that the cricketer, wrestler, minister all jumped in to react to the opinion of the 20-year-old girl
 rajvinder cor-gurmeher khud bhi ek tennis khilaadi he
 She understands very well how tennis players always joke with each other
 main ise bura nahin maanati
 Sehwag is a senior cricketer
 saath hi is desh kaa gaurav hai
 i respect his loyalty that he used to show IPL or cricket for the country everywhere
 main phogot bahanon kaa bhi sammaan karti hum
 She is a symbol of female power
 meri khud bhi do betiyaan hai
 He said what he said because of his love for the country
 unhone samajha ki gurmeher kii abhivyakti shaayad kuch alag he
 Gurmehar loves the country equally
 ye wo ladki he jisane phone par hello kii jagah vandemaataram kehane kii shuruyaat kii
 He did not say anything like anti-national
 jaisaa maine pehle kaha usne 'life ij beautiphul' jaisi filmein dekhakar apni taarkik soch viksit kii
 She also studies a lot
 jo padhati he use andar tak mahasoos karti he
 India Today- Nice to know that despite everything, you still have such positive thoughts
 lekin ek cheez logon ko pareshaan kar rahi he wo gurmeher kaa ye kahana ki pakistan ne nahin jang ne unke pita ko maaraa
 What do you have to say on this perspective of your daughter as a mother
 rajvinder cor-jaisaa ki maine pehle kaha ki uski sirf ek line ko uddhrut kiya gaya
 Gurmeharka's motive was to state his point by citing a particular incident
 choti hone par wo nafrat kii vajah se ek mahila ke peeche bhaagi thi
 Then her mother, that is, i explained that Pakistan had killed Jung, not her father
 deergh pariprekshya main gurmeher yahi bataanaa chaahati thi ki yuddh kya he
 War is destruction
 aisi sthiti jisamen log aapas main ladate hai, desh aapas main ladate hai
 i did not want to allow such an image of the neighboring country in my daughter's mind to be filled with poison or not ready to give an opportunity for peace in the future
 ye sirf clipings kaa ek hissaa tha
 He did not say that it did not happen
 usne kaha ki maine ise sakaaratmakataa ke saath liya or nafrat kii bhaavana ko khud se hataaya
 It was not for everyone
 kisi ko bhi bayaan ke peeche nahin janaa chahie
 He was asked to clear the perspective of an incident
 india today-aakhri sawaal kya aap beti gurmeher ko lekar bhaybheet hai? aap gurmeher se kya kah rahi hai
 Rajwinder Kaur - i am not scared
 main over protective se upar hum
 She is the daughter of military
 wo bahadur ladki he
 She makes her decisions
 wo kaayar nahin saahsee insaan he

 The constitutional bench of 7 judges of the Supreme Court said that 'hindutva' will not hear whether religion or lifestyle
 1995 ke jajment par dobaaraa vichaar nahin karenge
 He will decide whether votes can be sought in the name of religion? CJI ties thakur ne kaha ki 20 saal puraane faisle ke baad 5 jajon kii bench ne jo reference saat jajon kii samvidhan peeth main bheja usamen yah baat kahaan likhi gai he ki sanvaidhanik peeth ko hindutv kii vyakhya kerani he? faisle ke kisi bhi hisse main is baat kaa zikr nahin he

 The intention of promoting political activities by seeking votes on the basis of religion cannot be approved

Electoral process is secular and no religion can be mixed in it
 Election and religion are two different things, they cannot be mixed together
 Can religion be included in any secular activity? For 20 years, Parliament has not made any law in this regard
 If the court what was waiting for the Supreme Court about the decision to have such sexual Susn case
 agali sunwaayee 25 aktubar ko hogi
 The Supreme Court made this remark on the plea of petitioner Sundar Lal Patwa's counsel when it was said that the Supreme Court should allow the 1995 Judgment to be upheld
 chif justise ne kaha ki patwa kaa cese hi dekhen to vah jain samudaay se hai or koi unke liye kahe ki vah jain hone ke baavjood ram mandir banane main madad karenge to ye pratyaashee nahin balki dharm ke aadhaar par vot maangana hoga
 During the hearing, many big questions were also raised by the Chief Justice in the Supreme Court: - kya koi ek samudaay kaa vyakti apane samudaay ke logon se apane dharm ke aadhaar par vot maang saktaa he? kya ye bhrasht aacharan kii shrenee main aata he ?kya ek samudaay kaa vyakti duusare samudaay ke pratyaashee ke liye apane samudaay ke logon se vot maang saktaa he?kya kisi dharm guru ke kisi duusare ke liye dharm ke naam par vot maangana bhrasht aacharan hoga or pratyaashee kaa chunaav radd kiya jaae? Actually, how right and how wrong are the methods of seeking votes on the basis of religion, caste community etc
 during elections in India or by religious gurus to vote in the name of religion by supporting someone in elections? The Supreme Court is hearing this
 vahiin, supreme court ne maamle kii pehali sunwaayee ke dauraan centre sarkaar ko philhal party banane se inkaar kar diya tha
 CJI Thakur rejected the demand of the Central Government to be a party in the case and said that it is a case of an election petition, which is directly related to the Election Commission
 isamen centre sarkaar ko party nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 In fact, in the 1995 verdict, the Supreme Court had said that seeking a vote in the name of 'hindutva' does not benefit a candidate
 ' us vakt supreme court ne hindutv ko 've of life' yani jivan jeene kaa ek tarika or vichaar bataaya tha
 The Supreme Court had said that Hindutva is part of the lifestyle of Indians and cannot be confined to Hinduism and faith
 court ne kaha tha ki hindutv ke naam par vot maangana karpt practice nahin he or riprogentation of pipul act kii dhara-123 ke tahat ye bhrashtachar nahin he
 Counsel for the petitioner while doing section-123 and section 3 of the Representation of People's Act said that if a person asks for votes on the basis of varna, religion, caste, language and community, then it is termed as wrong methods of election
 
 aisa maamla paae jane par doshi vyakti kaa puraa chunaav radd kar diya jaataa he
 The comments gauratlab he ki 1992 main maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav hue the
 At that time, its leader Manohar Joshi had given a statement that he would make Maharashtra the first Hindu state
 jis par vivaad hua tha or 1995 main bambe hoicourt ne ukt chunaav ko radd kar diya tha
 Then the matter reached the Supreme Court

 The 2005 three-judge decision was referred to a five-judge constitutional bench
 janvari 2014 main sundar laal patwa kaa cese aane ke baad is maamle ko saat jajon kii samvidhan peeth ko bheja gaya
 CJI TS Thakur said that after the 20-year-old verdict, which reference was sent by the 5-judge bench to the Constitution Bench of seven judges, where is it written that the constitutional bench has to explain Hindutva? This is not mentioned in any part of the judgment
 jis baat kaa zikr hi nahin he
 
 usein ham kaise sun sakate hai? court philhal is badi bahes main nahin ja rahaa ki hindutv kya he or iskaa matlab kya he? During the hearing of the case, Chief Justice TS Thakur said that no candidate or any of his supporters can be allowed to ask for votes in the name of religion
 ye chunavi prakriya main sabase bady buraai he, kyonki dharm ke naam par log prabhavit hote hai
 Appeals to voters in any secular country should also be under the secular principle
 dharm ke aadhaar par vot mangakar raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko badhaava dene kii manshaa ko manjuuri nahin di ja sakati
 The hearing of the case will continue on Wednesday
 saamaajik kaaryakarta tista sitalwad, ritred profesar shamsul islam or patrkaar dilip mandal kii arji par supreme court ne yah tippni kii
 The Supreme Court said that this application will be considered later
 court ne is yachika ko lambit rakhaa he
 In fact, social activist Teesta Setalvad and many others have filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking to overturn the 20-year-old Hindutva Judgment
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki pichley dhai saal se desh main in adeshon kii aad main is tarah kaa maahaul banaaya ja rahaa he, jisase alpsankhyak, swatantra vichaarak or anya log khud ko asurakshit mahasoos kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, the Supreme Court should take strict action against those who gave such speeches, although in the last hearing, the CJI Thakur said in the Supreme Court: - kyon naa chunaav main dharm ke aadhaar par vot maangane ko chunavi dosha mana jaae?chunavi prakriya dharmanirpeksh hoti he or usamen kisi dharm ko nahin milaayaa ja saktachunaav or dharm do alag-alag chijen hai, unako ek saath nahin milaayaa ja saktakya kisi dharm nirpeksh rajya main kisi dharmanirpeksh gatividhi main dharm ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he?20 saal se sansad ne is bare main koi kanoon nahin banayitane vakt se maamla supreme court main he to kya intjaar ho rahaa tha ki is bare main supreme court hi faisla kare jaise yon shaushan cese main hua
 The next hearing will be on October 25
 supreme court ne yah tippanee yachikakarta sundar laal patwa ke vakil kii daleel par kii thi jab kaha gaya ki supreme court ko 1995 ke jajment ko bane rahane dena chahie
 The Chief Justice said that if we look at the case of Patwa, he is from the Jain community and if someone asks him to help build the Ram temple despite being a Jain, then it is not the candidate but will have to ask for votes on the basis of religion
 sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court main chif justise ne kai bade sawaal bhi uthaae the :- Can a person from one community ask for votes on the basis of their religion from the people of their community? Does it fall under the category of corrupt conduct? Can a person from one community ask for votes of another community candidate from another community? Will it be corrupt practice for a religion guru to vote for someone else in the name of religion and Should the candidate's election be canceled? darasal, bharat main chunaav ke dauraan dharm, jati samudaay ityadi ke aadhaar par vot maangane yaa phir dharm guruon dwaara chunaav main kisi ko samarthan dekar dharm ke naam par vot daalane sambandhi taur tareeke kitne sahi or kitne galat hai ? ise lekar supreme court sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 At the same time, the Supreme Court, during the first hearing of the case, had refused to make the Central Government a party at present
 CJI thakur ne centre sarkaar ko maamle main party banane sambandhi maang ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki yah ek chunaav yachika kaa maamla he, joki sidhe chunaav ayog se judaa he
 In this, the central government cannot be made a party
 darasal 1995 ke faisale main supreme court ne kaha tha ki- 'hindutv' ke naam par vot maangane se kisi ummidavaar ko koi faaydaa nahin hota he
 At that time, the Supreme Court had given Hindutva a way and idea of living a 'way of Life'
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki hindutv bharatiyon kii jivan style kaa hissaa he or ise hindu dharm or aasthaa tak simit nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 The court said that seeking votes in the name of Hindutva is not a corrupt practice and it is not corruption under Section 123 of the Representation of People Act
 yachikakarta ke vakil ne riprogentation of piples act kii dhara-123 va iske anubhag 3 par karte hue kaha ki varna, dharm, jati, bhashaa or samudaay ke aadhaar par agar koi vyakti vot maangata he to ise chunaav ke galat tareekon kii sangya di jaati he
 If such a case is found, the entire election of the guilty person is canceled
 tippaniyan Significantly, in the 1992 Maharashtra assembly elections were held
 us samay vahaan ke netaa manohar joshi ne bayaan diya tha ki maharashtra ko ve pehla hindu rajya banaaenge
 There was a dispute and in 1995 the Bombay High Court quashed the said election
 phir yah maamla supreme court pahunchaa tha
 Later in the Supreme Court, a bench of Justice Jess s Verma ruled that Hindutva is a way of life, it could not be combined with Hinduism and overturned the judgment of the Bombay High Court

 However, many political analysts believe that Modi has a point in which he can control this anger
 siyaasi vishleshak vidyut thakkar to yahaan tak kehete hai, ''congress ke liye jo samarthan dikhaai de rahaa he, vah mahaj upree he, or agar yah asal ho tab bhi party ke paas is samarthan ko voton main badalane kaa network nahin he
 "but Thakkar has not measured the land in areas like Saurashtra, where anger is building against the BJP in many parts
 yahaan patel badi taadaad main bhaajapa ke khilaaf ho chuke hai, jabaki obisi, jinhen bhaajapa rijhaane kii koshishen karti aa rahi he, us had tak uski baat nahin sun rahe hai jitna party chaahati
 But Modi is well-versed among the lower castes
 yah thik vaisaa hi he jaisaa notebandi ke baad dekha gaya
 Sanaji Thakor, who hails from a nearby village of Bahucharaji in Mehsana district, the center of the Thakor community, is a driver in a private company

 Sanaaji says, "modi will win this election

 In 2012, BJP won 115 seats and 47
 9 fisadi yaa takreeban 1
 31 crore votes, while Congress 38
 9 fisadi yaa 1
 Gained around 06 crore votes — 8 in both
 9 fisadi kaa fark tha
 But out of the 115 seats BJP won, the margin of victory on 15 was less than 5,000 votes
 itane hi antar se 23 siten ganvaai thim
 Both parties are putting full force on these 38 seats
 nirdaleey or choti partiyon ke ummidavaaron ne bhi 2012 main badi bhoomika adaa kii thi or 8
 11 per cent, or nearly 22 lakh, got a huge number of votes
 itnaa hi nahin, 2012 main modi ke dhuandhar abhiyaan ke baavjood gramin or ardhagramin siton par bhagava party kii jeet kaa antar bahut kam tha, kyonki un ilaakon main vikaas par jati ke mudde haaavee ho gaye the
 Of the votes cast in 125 such seats, the Congress got only 3 from the BJP
 7 fisadi vot kam mili the
 One thing that is in favor of the BJP here will be the success of the service-bridge scheme of Vijay Rupani government, in which the government was taken to the lowest unit of 10 villages
 isamen kai jan yojanaon ke phaayde vaaki labhaarthiyon ke daravaaje par hi unhen die gaye the
 During the course of one year, around one crore people were brought under the purview of this scheme

 booth prabandhan ranneeti shah kii mukhya takat he
 The Congress is weak in this skill
 shah ne rajya bhaajapa se yah pakkaa karne ko kaha he ki harek party kaaryakarta ke parivaar ke kam se kam teen sadsy dopaher 12 baje se pehle apane vot daal den
 The BJP is also relying on the 7,50,000 "voting page in-charge" that it has created
 gujarat main 45,000 se zyada poling booth hai or harek booth kii matadaata suchi ausatan 16 se zyada pannon main faili he
 For every page of the voters, the BJP has created a page in charge, which will focus its attention on the voters registered on that page
 is darje kaa baarik prabandhan hi vah takanic he jisamen shah ne vakt ke saath maharath hasil kar lee he or isane bhaajapa ko apane sikudte hue janaadhar ko bhi voton main badalane main khaase bade phaayde kii sthiti main laa diya he
 State Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi dismisses all this outright
