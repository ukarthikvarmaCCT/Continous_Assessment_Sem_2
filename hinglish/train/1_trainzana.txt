 sabase pehle unhone golgi ke silver-staning paddati kaa paanch ghante kii kam neend ko lekar dendritis or chuhon ke hippocampus se sambandhit dendritis spine kii sankhya ko lekar nirikshan kiya
 The analysis revealed that reduced sleep had reduced the length of dendrites and the density of the spinal cord related to nerve cells
 unhone kam neend ke pareekshan ko jari rakhaa, lekin iske baad chuhon ko bina baadha teen ghante sone diya
 This was done to test the earlier work of scientists
 purv main kaha gaya tha ki teen ghante kii neend, kam sone se hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye paryaapt he
 The effects of the five-hour sleep test were rechecked
 isamen chuhon ke dendrik strecchar kii nigaraanee chuhon ke sone ke dauraan kii gai, to dendrik strecchar main koi antar nahin paaya gaya
 This was then investigated as to what affects the molecular level from reduced sleep
 isamen khulaasa hua ki anvik tantra par kam neend kaa nakaaratmak asar padataa he or yah cofilin ko bhi nishaanaa banaata he

 Who is helpful for the absconding convicts in Punjab? Are Congress leaders and former mlas Harminder Singh Jassi and the Punjab Police helping them? Ram Rahim's Samadhi Jassi has been accused of helping the people of Honeypreet and Dera
 ye aarope unke kareebi rishtedaar or deraa ke purv sevadaar bhupendra singh gora ne lagaae the
 Though Jassi denied the allegations outright, sources reveal that some security personnel engaged in his z Plus security continued to protect Honeypreet for several days

 Did Honeypreet distribute the cash she brought with her helpers? Was the money sent to him that was hidden? Honeypreet's problems may increase According to sources, after the arrest of Dera spokesperson Pawan Man, Ram Rahim's mouthful daughter, Honeypreet's human problems may increase
 ek ore jahaan police pawan insaan ke jariye faraar chal rahe deraa ke duusare bade raajadaar doctor aditya insaan ko giraftaar kar sakati he

 App and web site are the solution to every problem in the world
 film 'running shaadi' bhi kuch aise hi vishay par he jisamen ram bharose naam kaa ek yuva naukari se nikaale jane ke baad ek aisi website kholta he jiske madhyam se yuva jode ram bharose se sampark karte hai or ram bharose un yuva jodon kii ghar se bhagaakar shaadi karwaata he
 Ram is in the role of Bharosa, Amit Sadh and in the film, Nimmi and her friend Cyber join them in driving these couples away from home
 nimmi kii bhoomika taapasi pannu ne nibhaai he
 That is, this website called Running Shaadi, drives away and marries those whose family members are against their marriage
 is film kaa vishay kaaphi dilachasp he or film kahin slo bhi nahin hoti he
 The second part of the film is particularly interesting when the story reaches Patna from Punjab
 kirdaar, unke haav bhav or lahaze kaaphi realistic lagate hai
 Humor has been used well in many places in the film
 teenon mukhya kirdaar taapasi pannu, amit saadh or arsh bajva kaa abhinay acha he
 The comments is film kii kamiyon kii baat karen to sabase badi problem yah he ki film kaa vishay jitna aakarshak he isaki kahani utani aakarshak nahin ban pai he
 The better the film starts, the better it does not end because after a while we see that a girl is running away with a boy for fear of her family
 is film kaa naam pehle 'running shaadi dot com' tha magar kisi kanoonee uljhan kii vajah se film ke naam se dot com hataanaa padaa
 Because of this, wherever the word dot com comes, the voice has been suppressed, which seems very strange throughout the film
 haalanki isamen ham filmkaar ko dosha nahin de sakate
 The film 'running Shaadi', which is based on a new topic, does not entertain a lot but also does not allow boredom, so my rating for this film is 2
 5 stars
 The subject of this film is quite interesting and the film does not even slide
 film kaa doosraa bhaag khaas taur se rochak he jab kahani punjab se patna pahunchati he
 The characters, their gestures and accents seem quite realistic
 film main kai jagahon par humar kaa acha istemaal kiya gaya he
 The three main characters Taapsee Pannu, Amit Sadh and Arsh Bajwa have good performances
 tippaniyan Talking about the shortcomings of this film, the biggest problem is that the story of the film is as attractive as its story has not become as attractive
 jitne achche se film kii shruwaat hoti he utane achche se iskaa ant nahin hota kyonki ek samay ke baad ham vahi dekh rahe hote hai ki ek ladki apane parivaar ke dar se ek ladke ke saath bhaag rahi he
 The name of this film was previously 'running Shaadi
com' but due to some legal confusion, the name of the film had to be removed
 is vajah se jahaan bhi dot com shabd aata vahaan awaz dabaa di gai he, jo puri film main bahut hi atapata lagata he
 However, we cannot blame the filmmaker in this
 ek nae vishay par bani film 'running shaadi' bahut zyada manoranjan to nahin karti magar bor bhi nahin hone detii isliye is film ke liye meri reating he 2
 5 stars is film kii kamiyon kii baat karen to sabase badi problem yah he ki film kaa vishay jitna aakarshak he isaki kahani utani aakarshak nahin ban pai he

 Recently, the Central Government announced a Chief of Defense Staff for the three services
 ise dhyaan main rakhte hue ek sanyukt sainya kanoon kii jarurat bataai gai jo sashastr balon main talmail ko aasaan banayega
 Why is the Joint Services Act needed? Sources said that for the needs of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force-three, a Joint Services Act is needed which will strengthen synergies between the three armies with military integration
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne is saal 15 agast ko swatantraaa diwas par ghoshnaa kii thi ki teenon senaaon ke liye ek chif of dephence staff niyukt kiya jayega
 a Joint Legislation as a Joint Service Act can be important for effective integration of forces and coordination between all three military structures
 ek adhikari ne kaha, 'is baithak main ek sanyukt seva adhinium kii jarurat par charchaa shuru hui he
 At present, separate Acts have been passed for the three Services from Parliament
 ab sanyukt seva adhinium par sarkaar kaa anumodan milane par senaaon ke ekikaran ko teji pradaan karegaa
 'on the integration of training, a committee under the leadership of the National Security Advisor Ajit Doval is considering the issue of Chief of Defense Staff, what should be the nature of the office of the chief of the three services, its responsibilities and rights so that it Worked as an advisory body between the government and the three

 agar congress ko yah lagata he ki vah madhya pradesh main kisaan karj maafee ke vaade par jiti he to phir yah karishma rajasthan main kyon nahin hua, jahaan is farvari main 8,500 karod ru
 a loan waiver was announced
 agar chhattisgarh main congress karj maafee ke vaade par jiti to isi par karnataka main bhaajapa ko bahumat kyon nahin mila
 The BJP government in Uttar Pradesh had waived the loan, yet people were not sure
 karnataka main congress ne 2017 main sahakaari bainkon ke 8,500 karod ru
 The debt was waived
 lekin rajya ke log jad (es) ke karj maafee vaade par bhi puri tarah bich nahin gaye
 Just because of a big electoral defeat or a win with luck, politics gets upset
 desh main pichley saal disambar se ab tak saat rajyon (punjab or maharashtra-june 2017, uttar pradesh-april 2017, rajasthan-farvari 2018, karnataka-july 2018, chhattisgarh or madhya pradesh-disambar 2018) main 1,72,146 karod ru
 Announcement of waiving farmer loans
 kya inase chunaavon ke nattejey badale?kya bhaajapa or congress kii sarkaron kii karj maafee baad main hue chunaavon main unke kaam ai?kisaanon ke karj bhartiya raajnneeti kii sarvadaleey granthi ban gaye hai
 Debt waiver does not reach the needy farmers, there is no need to be a scientist to know it, but this shows the vicious cycle in the financial system to what extent the politics has become irresponsible
 • madhya pradesh, karnataka, rajasthan, punjab, maharashtra or uttar pradesh main kisaan karj maafee ke baad ab desh adhikansh krishi aadhaarit rajya is hode kii chapet main hai
 This will be repeated in Bihar, Bengal and some other states
 madhya pradesh or rajasthan kii karj maafee bainkon va sarkaar ke liye dardanaak hone vaali he
 In the Reserve Bank of India, Madhya Pradesh accounts for 29 per cent of the total bank credit and 35 per cent in Rajasthan
 jo anya rajyon kii tulana main kaaphi ooncha he
 In Madhya Pradesh, the debt stuck in agriculture is 11 per cent
 yah str rashtriya ausat se kaaphi ooncha he
 • While signing the loan waiver, the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh did not even mention that Rs 35,000 crore
 kaa yah bill koun bharegaa? karnataka ke kul bank karj main kheti ke karj 15 fisadi he
 Half of their forgiveness will be on the banks and half on the state budget
 yah formula abhi tak ban nahin paaya he isliye karj maafee lagu karne main deree ho rahi he
 • Uttar Pradesh (rs 36,359 crore)
 ) or maharashtra (34,022 karod ru
 ) Took the entire debt waiver on the budget
 maharashtra ko kharch chalaane ke liye shiridy mandir se karj lenaa padaa or uttar pradesh ko puunji kharch (nirmaan va vikaas) kharch main 33 fisadi kii katautee kerani padi
 Debt waiver states have fallen in ratings, meaning they will have to take expensive loans
 • baar baar karj maafee ke kaaran sarkari bank kisaanon ko karj dene main hichakate hai
 State bank's share in agricultural credit has fallen sharply, while private banks are taking a larger share, which is difficult to forgive
 karnataka main microfinance companiyon ko notebandi va karj maafee ke baad gahari chot lagi
 • Would our politicians want to know that banks in India are afraid to touch farming? Between 2007 and 2017, the growth rate of agricultural credit declined from 33 percent to 8
 2 fisadi par aa gai
 In Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, debt supply to agriculture has fallen badly after debt waiver in the last three years
 baat karj maafee se aage badhkar bijli bill maafee tak pahunch gai he
 Tomorrow there will be politics to forgive home loans
 antat: ham us taraf bad rahe hai jahaan yaa to kisaanon ko karj milanaa mushkil ho jayega yaa phir karj maafee ke baad har tarah kaa tex badhegaa yaa vikaas sikud jayega
 If the states of India were a company made up of Kamal Nath, Vasundhara Raje or Yogi Adityanath with their own money, without knowing the impact and benefits, they would have made bets of loan waiver? This whole drama is on the money of taxpayers or depositors and we are cheated again and again by blowing money
 karj maaf ho rahaa he, ab keemat chukaane ko taiyaar rahiye
 *** desh ke purv vitt mantri or usase pehle naukarshah rahe senior bijepi netaa yashavanth sinha kaa naam bipiel list main mila he

 The country's new Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoine took charge on Wednesday
 buudhvaar se hi CJI ection mod main dikhaai die
 On the very first day of his tenure, he rejected the petition regarding election reform and reprimanded the lawyer
 iske kuch hi der baad unhonesupreme courtka nayarosterjari kar diya, ye roster aaj se hi lagu hoga
 According to the new roster, all cases related to pils will be heard by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi himself
 nayaa roster mukademon kii shrenee ke anusaar banaaya gaya he
 Accordingly, the Chief Justice will hear public interest litigation, election petition, contempt petition, social justice, criminal cases and petitions for constitutional posts
 agar in maamalon ko kisi or bench ke paas bheja janaa he to is par bhi chif justise hi faisla karenge
 According to the new roster, second-ranked judge Madan B
 lokur ko PIL, van sangrakshan, bhoomi, jal, ped, paramilitary force, sena, khanan jaise maamle saunpe gaye hai
 In the Supreme Court on the basis of seniority, the number three judge, Justice Kurian Joseph, was given cases related to contempt, religious, personal law, banking, government contracts, criminal, labor, tax, rent, land acquisition, civil, judicial rights, land act
 Huh
 vahiin justise arjan sikri ko pratyaksh-apratyaksh kar, chunaav or aapraadhik maamalon ko saunpa gaya he
 Significantly, in the last few days, the issue of roster has been very much discussed in the Supreme Court
 purv mukhya nyaayadhish deepak mishra ke kaarykaal main supreme court ke chaar jajon ne ( inamen CJI ranjan gogoi bhi shaamil the) roster par sawaal uthaae the
 All the judges held a press conference regarding this
 saal kii shuruyaat main roster ko lekar kaaphi vivaad hua tha, naaraaz jajon ne isko lekar kai baar CJI se shikaayat bhi kii thi
 However, later it was decided that the Chief Justice is the master of the roster, what he decides will be the final decision
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne unnav se bijepi saansad sakshi maharaj ke vivaadit bayaan kaa samarthan kiya he
 In the party's mouthpiece 'saamana', he wrote that madrasas have become factories to produce jihadis and this is not a comment that should create a ruckus
 shivasena pramukh uddhav ne likhaa he ki sakshi maharaj ke bayaan main vivaadaaspad kuch bhi nahin he or is par 'khalabali' nahin machni chahie
 He wrote that many such proofs have come out in relation to Madrasas
 unhone rashtriyata ke nirmaan main madrason ke yogadan par sawaal uthaae
 He wrote, 'mulla maulvi disclose which songs are sung in madrasas to show love for motherland
 ' is 'jahrile' sampadakeey main likhaa gaya he, 'sir main tiraskaar or matsar (irshyaa) main barood bharne kaa kaam madrason main ho rahaa he
 Weapons and ammunition have been found in many madrasas
 kuch madrason se pakistani nagarikon kii giraftaar hui he
 The Shiv Sena chief has written that Sakshi Maharaj's statement is a bitter truth in the country and there is no reason for it to erupt in the society
 unhone likhaa, 'musalamaanon kii ek peedi madrason ke chakkar main agyaan or andhkaar main chali gai, yah durbhaagya nahi he to kya he
 ' aaj kisaanon ke bare main likhte samay haal main chhapi ek khabar dimaag main aa rahi he, jo surkhiyon main apni jagah nahin bana pai
 About half of the country is still in the grip of drought
 jis desh main pichley kuch dashakon main lakhon kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii ho, vahaan is khabar par kitne logon kaa dhyaan gaya
 
 
 The The country which shouts slogans like 'jai Jawan, Jai Kisan', why should the government or society today not see the same uneasiness about farmers
 
 
 ? fasal beemaa yojana ke tahat companiyon ko saal bhar main hazaron karod rupee kaa faaydaa hota he or har saal hazaron kisaan aatmahatya kar lete hai
 Why, so
 
 
 ? isi sawaal ke saath pragatisheel sanghathan baar-baar sadakon par utre hai or aage bhi tab tak utarate rahenge, jab tak kisaanon or duusare vanchit tabakon ke masalon kii andekhi hoti rahegi
 Will the problems of the farmers be overcome by pardoning their debts or by giving them Rs 6,000 a year
 
 
 ? sarkaar ko yah samajhnaa hoga ki jab zarurat open-heart surgery kii ho, to band-aid dekar ilaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The real issue is to save agriculture, if this happens, the farmers themselves will be saved
 pradhanmantri kisaan yojana main kisaan parivaar ko ek din main lagbhag saadhe solah rupee dekar unka apmaan hi kiya gaya he
 But to hide this truth, a Hindi newspaper wrote about the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Yojana, "farmers become Malamal
 
 
 " jab desh ke itane mahatvapurn mudde ko lekar media ke ek hisse main aisi khokhli samaj ho, to kalpana kiijie ki kisaan kitni mushkilon se apni baat logon tak pahunchaa pate honge
 Issues of farmers are missing from the mainstream media, and whenever there is an exception, the farmers are not called in, who do not understand farming
 hamen is sawaal kaa jawaab dhundhana chahie ki kheti ko munaafe kaa kaam kaise banaaya ja saktaa he
 The government, which is beating the farmers for giving the right price of the crop, till date did not understand the need to add all the expenses to the cost price
 laagat kii paribhaasha badalakar modi sarkaar ne kisaanon ke saath bahut badi beyimaani kii he
 Not only this, neither vegetables nor fruits nor cash crops fall under the MSP
 swaminathan ayog kii report kii sifaarishein lagu karne kaa vaada bhi asal main ek jumala hi tha
 According to the 2015 report of the Shanta Kumar Committee, only six per cent of the farmers are able to sell their crops at the government rate
 jis desh main santoshi 'bhaat-bhaat' kehete hue mar jaati he, vahaan sarkari anaaj godaamon main sad jaataa he
 The Food Corporation of India (FCI) should have a proper distribution of the procurement, storage, transportation and distribution of food grains
 jab tak buniyadi suvidhaayen behatar nahin banaai jaaengi, kisaanon ko cold storage, dhulaai aadi ke liye bichauliyon par nirbhar hona padegaa
 It is not right to take loans as the only way to solve all the problems of farmers
 duusari chizon par bhi dhyaan dena zaruri he
 For example, the holdings of farmers are getting smaller, due to which their profits have reduced greatly
 2011 main ausat jot keval sava hectare thi, jo pehle ke aankadon se bhi kam he
 According to this year's population data, about 85 percent of the farmers in the country have less than two hectares of land
 agar kooparative kheti ko badhaava diya jaae, to beej se lekar sinchai tak har chiz par kheti kii laagat kam hogi or isse kisaanon kaa faaydaa hoga
 One problem is the high interest rate of the loan
 swaminathan ayog kii report main chaar pratishat dar kii baat kahi gai thi, jise or kam karne ke saath-saath bichauliyon par kisaan kii nirbharta ko bhi khatm karne kii zarurat he
 With the help of science, there is a need to promote organic agriculture along with improving things like pesticides to irrigation, but for the last five years, the government of the country has been spending taxpayer money on advertisements instead of science
 rashtriya krishi evam gramin vikaas bank, yani naabard (NABARD) ke survey ke anusaar, aaj sirf 12
 7 per cent of the agricultural households have full income from farming
 baaki kisaanon ko yaa to gaanv main hi mazaduri kerani padati he yaa unhen shaharon kaa rukh karnaa padataa he, jahaan ve kabhi footpath par sone ko majaboor hote hai, to kabhi unhen bahut kam mehtaane par kaam karnaa padataa he
 His death is not recorded in any government data related to farmers
 yahaan main un lakhon kisaanon kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum, jinhone haalia dashakon main aatmahatya kii he
 When will the farmers who are dying anonymously die in the struggle for livelihood in the cities
 
 
 ? jahaan sarkaar ko acchhee nitiyaan banaakar unhen lagu karnaa chahie, vahiin use galat nitiyaan banaakar unka prachaar karne se hi fursat nahin mil rahi
 Today all citizens, especially the youth, should openly speak on such issues
 agar ve aise zaruri masalon se dhyaan hataakar farzi masalon par bahes chalaane waalon kii raajnneetik dukaane band kar denge, to isse kisaanon kii zindagi kii tasviir zarur badalegi
 Today, one of the reasons for the caste-based militant movements is that the castes which have mainly depended on farming and farming do not see any other option for livelihood
 aaj kisaan kaa betaa kisaan kyon nahin bananaa chahta
 
 
 The If we want to understand the problems of farming and farming properly, then we should try to find the answer to this question
 aaj yuvaaon ko sochna hoga ki jab desh ke kisaan kheton main mar rahe hon, to fesabook par tirange kii tasviir daalane maatr se unki zimmedaariyaan puri nahin hongi
 They have to raise their voice with the farmers, understanding the sorrow and pain

 Controversy erupted after a photo of Pak Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa was seen on this occasion with Khalistani supporter Gopal Singh Chawla
 bharat ke sena pramukh general bipin ravat ne kaha ki sarkaar ne saaf kaha he ki is kaarykram ko alag karke dekhnaa chahie or ise kisi or maamle se nahin jodna chahie
 As everyone knows, terrorism sponsored from the soil of Pakistan has the support of its intelligence agency
 3-kartarpur ke manch par tevar jang kaa, paigaam aman kaa70 saal ke intjaar ke baad aakhirkaar kartarpur sahib coridor kii neenv pad hi gai he

 The message of peace and brotherhood is being conveyed through this corridor, but from the stage, Imran Khan once again raised the issue of war and Kashmir in both the countries

 The players kept away from the field due to the incessant rain and the weather was continuously bad
 sidney main mangalvaar raat ko hi barish shuru ho gai thi or lagbhag puure din barish hone ke kaaran maidan kaaphi geela ho gaya
 5-india made such a road that will come in JD

 iske select hone ke baad hi aapako intervyuu ke liye bulaayaa jaataa he
 On the other hand, if you are preparing a resume for a job and do not understand how to make it good, then follow these tips
 1
 Avoid using difficult words: Do not use difficult words in your resume
 agar aapako lagata he ki aap kathin shabdon kaa yuj kar acha impressant bana sakenge to aap galat he
 Try to use words that are commonly spoken
 agar aap kathin shabdon kaa prayog karte hai to uskaa matlab jarur jaan len
 Do this work before starting a startup, you will get success 2
 font kaa khyaal rakhen:rigeume banaate vakt font kaa khaas khyaal rakhen
 Using too big or too much font can make your resume look ugly
 3
 Do not give space without meaning: If you think that you will give more space in your resume, then it will look clear and clear then you are wrong
 kaaphi sara white spes bhi aapke rigeume kaa luk kharaab kar detaa he
 So avoid giving space
 naukari ke saath-saath shuru karen ye bijness, jald hone lagegi kamai5
 Avoid grammatical mistakes: Grammatical mistakes are often seen in resumes
 isliye kahin bhi applai karne se pehle rigeume ko baar-baar check karen or dusron se bhi check karvaa len
 To become a successful businessman you have to give up these habits
 jhooth na likhen:aksar aisa dekha jaataa he ki kai log rigeume kaa vajan badhaane ke liye usamen aisi chijen likh dete hai jiske bare main unhen khud bhi nahin pataa hota
 Avoid writing such things because if you do not know what you have written, then you may be embarrassed in the interview

 'unhone kaha, 'shankaracharya aaenge or jaaenge, lekin aasthaa barkaraar rahegi
 Religion is a private matter
 koi bhi vyakti kisi kii aasthaa main hastkshep nahin kar saktaa
 This would be a form of violence if we prevent Sai devotees from worshiping
 hamen ye pataa hona chahie ki kisi kii aasthaa par taanaashaahee lagu karne kaa adhikaar hamen nahin he
 'it is noteworthy that before taking retirement, Pilot Baba himself was a professional pilot
 unhone kaha, 'haridwar or prayag main naga saadhuon se ikattha hone kii baat kahkar shankaracharya charampanth ko badhaava de rahe hai

 darasal,pradhanmantri ke liye nehru chunauti ban gaye hai
 He himself has considered Nehru a challenge
 vah lagaataar nehru ko khandit karte rahete hai
 The army of his supporters is constantly spreading lies about Nehru in a false university called whatsapp
 nehru ke saamne jhooth se gadha gaya ek nehru khadaa kiya ja rahaa he
 Now the fight is no longer between Modi and Nehru
 ab ladaai ho gai he asli nehru or jhooth se gadhe gaye nehru kii
 You know, the real Nehru victory in this battle
 nehru se ladate-ladate pradhanmantri narendra modi ke chaaron taraf nehru kaa bhoot khadaa ho gaya
 Nehru has his own history
 vah kitabon ko jala dene or teen murti bhawan ke dhaha dene se nahin mitega
 Modi himself is making this mistake
 nehru-nehru karte-karte vah chaaron taraf nehru ko khadaa kar rahe hai
 Nehru is now visible around Modi
 unke samarthak bhi kuch din main nehru ke visheshgy ho jaaenge,modi ke nahin
 Even if they would have Nehru fabricated with lies, it would be Nehru
 pradhanmantri ke chunavi bhaashanon ko sunakar lagata he ki nehru kaa yahi yogadan he ki unhone kabhi bose kaa,kabhi patel kaa to kabhi bhagat singh kaa apmaan kiya
 He was not in the fight for independence, he was fighting to humiliate some leaders
 kya nehru in logon kaa apmaan karte hue british hukumat kii jelon main nau saal rahe the
 
 
 The How long will we see the tune of ideological distance, contradiction and different paths between these leaders in the frame of humiliation
 is hisaab se to us daur main har koi ek duusare kaa apmaan hi kar rahaa tha
 The specialty of the national movement was that there were one to one strong leaders with different views
 yah khubi gandhi kii thi
 He had a period of his time, due to which the sky filled with leaders from outside the Congress and Congress was visible
 gandhi ko bhi yah avasar unase pehle ke netaaon or samaaj sudhaarkon ne uplabdh karaayaa tha
 In Modi's words, it is also an insult to Bhagat Singh that all his sacrifices are being linked to a lie made for Nehru
 bhagat singh or nehru ko lekar pradhanmantri ne jo galat bolaa he,vah galat nahin,balki jhooth he
 Nehru and Field Marshal Kariyappa, who have lied about General Thimyya, was also a lie
 kai log is galatafahami main rahete hai ki pradhanmantri kii research team kii galati he
 Look at his statements carefully
 jab aap ek-ek shabd ke saath puure bayaan ko dekhenge,to usamen ek dizine dikhegaa
 In the statement of Bhagat Singh, he first distinguishes himself
 kehete hai ki unhen itihaas kii jaankaree nahin he or phir agle vaakyon main vishwaas ke saath yah kehete hue sawaalon ke andaaz main baat rakhte hai ki us vakt jab bhagat singh jail main the,tab koi congressi netaa nahin milane gaya
 If you see his statement on the meeting held in Mani Shankar Aiyar's house in Gujarat elections, then a design will be seen
 bayanon ke diziner ko yah pataa hoga ki aam janata itihaas ko kitabon se nahin,kuch afvaahon se jaanati he
 It is a rumor about Bhagat Singh that the leaders of that time did not attempt to save him from hanging
 isi jansulabh afvaah se taar milakar or uske aadhaar par nehru ko sandigdh banaaya gaya
 Without being named, Nehru did not go to meet Bhagat Singh
 yah itnaa saadhaaran tathy he ki isamen kisi bhi research team se galati ho hi nahin sakati
 There could have been a lapse in the date or year, but the whole context is wrong, it shows a pattern
 yah or baat he ki bhagat singh sampradayikta ke ghor virdohi the or ishwar ko hi nahin maanate the
 As much as Bhagat Singh is clear atheist on the question of communalism, so is Nehru
 balki donon kareeb dikhte hai
 Nehru and Bhagat Singh respected each other
 virodh bhi hoga,to kya iskaa hisaab chunavi reliyon main hoga

 bihar main satta parivartan ke lagaataar jari prayaason ke bich janata dal united (jediu) ke rashtriya adhyaksh sharad yadav buudhvaar ko patna pahunche
 Although the reason for their visit to Patna is to attend the party meeting, but experts believe that Sharad and Nitish Kumar are not happy with the functioning of the current Chief Minister of Bihar Jitan Ram Manjhi and want to show them the way out
 lekin party adhyaksh ne patna pahunchane par kaha ki philhal aisa koi prayaas nahin chal rahaa he ki mukhyamantri maanjhi ko hataaya jaae or nitish kumaar ko dobaaraa mukhyamantri banaaya jaae
 According to experts, Sharad Yadav is trying to convince Manjhi to resign from him, so he has also directed the anti-manjhi ministers not to make any statement against him for the time being
 is bich, rashtriya janata dal (argedy) adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav dwaara nitish kumaar ko phir mukhyamantri banane kii muhim ko lekar jab maanjhi se sawaal kiya gaya to unhone palatakar sawaal kiya, aisi khabar kahaan se ai he
 
 
 The He said, i am the Chief Minister right now, and i have not heard any such thing
 maanjhi ne saaf kaha ki unke netaa nitish kumaar hai or agar nitish is sambandh main kuch bolenge, tabhi unase is bare main sawaal kiya janaa chahie
 According to experts, Manjhi is sure to leave, but when and how it will happen, no one knows
 isi bich, bijepi ne jeethanram maanjhi se vidhansabha bhang kar nae chunaav karaane kaa anurodh kiya he
 The voting for the fifth phase of the Lok Sabha elections (election 2019) is to be held on 6 May
 is puure chunaav main vipaksh ke saamne sabase badi chunauti ki vah kaise bijepi ke khilaaf padane vaale voton ko bikharane se roke
 Before the announcement of the election, the Congress made a great effort for opposition unity and also tried to bring all the parties to the UPA
 lekin aisa ho nahin paaya
 In Uttar Pradesh, the SP-BSP and RLD are contesting separate elections, while in West Bengal also TMC leader Mamata Banerjee also did not give a sense to the Congress
 vahiin andhra pradesh main tidipi ne bhi congress kii baat nahin maani
 However, in Bihar Congress RJD has aligned with many smaller parties
 lekin bijepi+jediu+algepi kaa vot bank is mahagathbandhan par baari pad rahaa he
 Talk about those seats where it would have been very difficult for the BJP if the Congress and other opposition parties had fought together
 ab congress kii mahasachiv priyanka gandhi is baat kii safai de rahi hai ki uttar pradeshunaki party 'votakatwa' nahin he or vah kabhi bijepi ke madad ke bare main soch bhi nahin sakati hai
 At the same time, you will remember that in Saharanpur rally, BSP supremo Mayawati also told the Muslims not to spoil their vote by voting for the Congress
 unke is bayaan par bavaal bhi machaa tha or chunaav ayog se bhi shikaayat kii gai thi

 He is indeed a huge loss to the nation
 But his loss to our family is deeper
 a void never to be filled
 i have grown up around him and buji, played innumerable times with Sonali and Rohan, in his office when he was a lawyer
 i remember him as someone always working hard, dedicated and so focused
 His knowledge and sharp insight about everything was tremendous and indepth
 He loved the company of children and the youth and always wanted to hear how our lives were going and how we saw our future
 It used to be mesmerizing to sit in the same room as him and hear him talk as he would have everyone engaged and in splits with his anecdotes and stories one after another from his incredible life
 He exemplified high standard of ethics, ideologies and value system which i have seen and try to imbibe in my work and life
 i will always remember him with a warm prayer, immense gratitude and love
 i truly believe legends live on forever and he truly will
 My heart is always with you buji, Sonali and Rohan
 i know you are resting in peace fufaji
 Warmest prayers for you now and always

 aisa hi kuch prayaas kiya he actor diarector or produsar rahul bose ne
 Rahul has made this film 'poorna' based on the life of 'poorna Malawat', the youngest Indian girl to climb Mount Everest on 25 May 2014
 Movie Review: ection kaa tagada dose he 'naam shabana'kahaneeyah kahani purna malavat (aditi inaamdaar) kii he jo telugana ke ek chote se gaanv kii rahane vaali ladki he or uske ghar kii mali halaat thik naa hone kii vajah se wo skool kii fees bhi nahin de paati he
 Poorna goes to school with her uncle's daughter Priya and then one day tries to run away from the government school at Priya's behest as many things were available for free at the government school
 phir choti umr main hi priya kii shaadi ho jane se purna ke pita uske kehane par sarkari skool main daakhila kara dete hai
 When Praveen Kumar (rahul Bose), an inspector of the school, comes to know that Poorna has run away from school due to lack of proper food, he takes a class

 Film Reveiw: Interesting story, but boils down to what Filaurikans can see - in the film you get all kinds of emotions, whether it is to move forward with emotion or sometimes with moist eyes breaking hope
 - tital role ko nibhaate hue aditi inaamdaar ne behtareen parformons di he, vahin baaki sah kalakaaron ke saath rahul bose kaa kaam bhi sahaj he
 - The screenplay and cinematography of the film is also accurate due to which the stagnation remains and you are also able to connect with the film
 - film ke gane kamaal ke hai jo kahani ke saath-saath chalate hai or becoground score bhi badhiya he
 - The story of 'poorna' in the film as well as distribution of food in government school as well as issues like child marriage have also been highlighted
 - film ke aakhri ke 15 minute behad khaas he or theatre main taaliyon kii gunj bhi sunai padati he

 The fare of the two Tejas Express trains operated by the railway subsidiary IRCTC will be 50 per cent less than the flights on the same route
 sutron ne mangalvaar ko yah jaankaree di
 The Indian Railways Tourism and Catering Corporation (IRCTC), the tourism and catering arm of the railway, has been given an exemption to fix fares for the delhi-lucknow Tejas Express and ahmedabad-mumbai Central Tejas Express trains

 Sources said that IRCTC is working on deciding the form of both trains which will be equal to Shatabdi trains
 unhone bataaya ki in trainon main kisi bhi yatri ke liye na to riyaayat hogi or na hi kota hoga, bhale hi vah viipi hi kyon na ho
 Significantly, in the beginning, the fare of the Tejas Express train was said to be 20 percent more than the fare of Shatabdi Express
 kaha gaya tha ki yah kiraaya bhale hi bahut zyada lag rahaa ho lekin sambandhit adhikariyon kii maane to yah mufeed he 
 Also, let us tell you that this fare (20% more than Shatabdi) is just an increase in basic fare and other charges (such as food charge, reservation charge etc
) will be levied separately

 yadi koi yatri tikat kharidte vakt bhojan kaa vikalp chunata he to kiraaye main khanpan shulk alag se joda jayega
 The fare for executive category in Tejas without food will be fixed at Rs 2,540 and the fare with food will be Rs 2,940
 bhojan ke saath chair car kaa kiraaya 1,850 rupye hoga or bhojan ke bagaiyr iskaa kiraaya 1,220 rupye hoga
 Now, if we talk about the rent of Shatabdi, its executive category and chair car category are Rs

 Like you who "," We are together "movies to see that the audience made today
 ab lagbhag 16 saal baad ek baar phir se salmaan or suraj kii film 'prem ratan dhan payo' relies hui he
 Will the public like Sooraj Barjatya's style in 2015? Will this family film be adopted once again in the commercial era? Let's review the film
 kahaneeyah kahani he ayodhya main rahane valeprem (salmaan khan)kii, jo bada dilavaala he
 Ramleela remembers him, lives in tune, Prem donates his earnings to the charitable trust of the princess Maithili (sonam Kapoor) and this time trying to meet Maithili himself with his friend Kanhaiya (deepak Dobriyal) The palace goes along
 prem ko maithili kaa swabhaav or logon kii help karne kii adaa se bada sarokaar he
 Especially when flood situation comes, Maithili helps everyone
 prem ko kuch hi dinon main maithili se milane kaa saubhaahgya praapt hota he or pyaar kaa maahaul shuru ho jaataa he
 The story then features Prince Vijay (salman Khan) and step-sisters Swara Bhaskar (chandrika) and Ashika Bhatia (radhika) as well as brothers Ajay (neil Nitin Mukesh), caretaker Chirag (armaan Kohli), Dewan Sahab (anupam Kher) Entries take place and a turbulent story of family relationships unfolds
 ab uljhe rishton ko sulajhaa paanaa aasaan hoga? yah jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 The script film is built on the foundation of fictional and family relationships
 lekin aaj ke yug main itani puraani kalpana hajam nahin ho paati
 a person with a mustache and a mustache is not recognizable by his or her acquaintances
 haalanki film par kiya gaya kharch scrin par dikhaai bhi padataa he lekin vah ek tarah se vyarth hi jaan padataa he
 Sooraj Barjatya Saheb should have paid little attention to reality
 bhavy sets or umdaa acting ke bich script feeki rah gai
 The atmosphere created before Interval further disintegrated after Interval
 abhinayadohari bhoomika mensalmaan kaa kaam apane donon kirdaaronke saath nyaaysangat he vahiin film ke baaki kalakaaron jaise sonam kapur, swara bhaskar, anupam kher, nil nitin mukesh, armaan kohli , deepak dobariyaal, sanjay mishra ,diparaj rana ne bhi sahaj bhoomika nibhaai he
 Music The music of the film is already popular, especially the title track, but some songs could have been cut down which could have made the film a little shorter and crisp
 gaanon kii vajah se film or bhi lambii hoti gai
 Weak episode The weak link of the film is its script and pace, which could have been even more crisp and due to this, the film could not do well despite being a good performer
 kahani par vishesh dhyaan diya jaataa to film kisi or level par jaati
 Why see the presence of Salman Khan, family love of Sooraj Barjatya and if you are a fan of perfectly clean films, then you must watch this film with family
 jammu or kashmir ke 2 bade netaaon ne congress ke ghoshnaa patr kaa swaagat kiya he
 These two leaders are former Chief Minister of the state Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah
 congress ne mangalvaar ko loksabhaa chunaav kaa ghoshnaa patr jari kiya jisamen kashmir main sainya bal (vishesh bal) adhinium (AFSPA) hataae jane par vichaar karne kaa vaada kiya gaya he

 These issues include the removal of AFSPA, no tampering with the constitutional provisions of Jammu and Kashmir and the introduction of unconditional discussion
 jammu kashmir main aman chaiyn ke liye pidipi kaa rodmap yahi he
 'congress has shown great courage by endorsing issues PDP involving in its agenda of alliance with BJP
 Revocation of AFSPA, not fiddling with JK constitutional provisions & holding unconditional dialogue 
 The roadmap PDP envisages is the only solution for a peaceful j & Kpic

 com / hddumnzzzk — Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti) April 2, 2019 According to the Congress manifesto, the party will improve the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and also review the Disturbed Areas Act in Afspa and Jammu Kashmir
 ghoshnaptr main jammu kashmir ke chaatro, vyapaariyon or anya ko suraksha or padhai ke adhikaar ke saath-saath desh main kahin bhi vyapaar karne kii suvidha dene kaa vaada kiya gaya
 The manifesto stated that the party was' deeply concerned about the discrimination and harassment of the people here
 ' jammu kashmir ke bare main ghoshnaptr main yah bhi kaha gaya he, "ham do-tarafa drushtikon apanaayenge-pehla, seemaa par bina kisi kintu-parantu ke saath puri majbootee or ghuspaith ko khatm karenge or doosraa, janata kii maangon ko puraa karne main nishpakshta dikhaate hue unka dil or dimag jeetenge
 "former Chief Minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah termed the Congress manifesto as 'late', saying that some of his friends in the Congress conspired against the removal of AFSPA and continued demands for its removal during his Chief Minister's term
 Kept doing but nobody listened
 abdulla ne news agency eenai se kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki unhen yah mudda (afaspa hataanaa) tab uthaanaa chahie tha jab main mukhyamantri tha
 At that time, when i demanded the removal of AFSPA, some Congress friends conspired against it
 main unka naam nahin lenaa chahta lekin mujhe sirf pi
 There was support from Chidambaram
 'umr abdulla ne aage kaha, 'congress ne agar iskaa zikr kiya he to main iskaa swaagat karata hum
 Had it been done before 2014, AFSPA would have been removed by now in some parts of the state
 ' gauratlab he ki jammu kashmir main kaaphi pehle se afaspa hataae jane kii maang ho rahi he
 Especially the opposition parties of BJP have kept their demand sharp from the beginning
 unka kahana he ki yah kanoon maanavadhikaron kaa ulanghan he or janabhaawanaaon ke khilaaf he
 Apart from Jammu and Kashmir, AFSPA is applicable in Nagaland and Manipur
 uttar purv ke kuch anya ilaakon main bhi yah kanoon lagaaya gaya he
 Under this law, the army has got some special rights
 sena kisi kii giraftaar kar sakati he or hinsa kii sthiti main firing bhi kar sakati he
 But for many years, there have been allegations by the people of Jammu and Kashmir and some parties that the army violates human rights under the guise of this law
 gauratlab he ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye congress ne mangalvaar ko apana 53 pannon kaa ghoshnaptr jari kiya jisamen sushasan, kisaanon ko rin se mukti, maujuuda rojgaar ko bachaate hue nae rojgaron kaa srijan or bina kisi bhedbhaav ke bhrashtachar-rodhi kanoonon ko lagu karne kaa vaada kiya gaya he

 pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) ne apane dhuandhar prachaar abhiyaan ke tahat shuukravaar ko andhrapradesh main bhi ek raily ko sambodati kiya
 Addressing the rally, he said, '5 years ago, the strength of one of your votes made me the chief servant
 aapaki ummid, aapaki aashaa-aakanksha, aapke hi aadesh ko dhyaan main rakhte hue aapke sevak ne 5 saal tak din raat kaam kiya he
 This watchman has guarded the interests of Andhra Pradesh with full vigil in 5 years, fulfilling the age-old demands of the people of Andhra Pradesh
 unhone raily main maujuud logon se kaha, 'apni pehali hi cabinet main polavaram adhyadesh ko manjuuri kisne di- aapke is chaukeedaar ne

 He said, 'two big things are going to happen on 11 April 2019

 There is a general discussion in Andhra Pradesh that there are no scams in government schemes here, but schemes are made for scams
 yahaan nai rajdhani se lekar alag-alag pariyojnaon main kya-kya khel ho rahe hai, kiski tijoriyaan bhari ja rahi hai, ye andhra pradesh kii janata bhaleebhanti jaanati he
 When your watchman questioned the game, U-turn Babu also took a U-turn from Andhra's promise of development and distanced himself from NDA
 ab U-turn babu ne aise doston ko dhundha he, jo Bail gaadi par chalate hai
 Bail car, ie those who are out on bail on charges of corruption and driving their politics
 U-turn babu, jhooth bolne main jitne maahir hai, centre kii yojanaon par apana steekar chipkaane main bhi utane hi bade kalakaar hai
 So now people have started calling them by the name of 'sticker babu'
 'sarveh agar aaj loksabhaa chunaav hon to piem modi ke netritv main endie jitegaa yaa haaregaa?piem modi ne kaha, 'centre sarkaar, piem-kisaan yojana ke tahat desh ke 12 karod chote kisaan pariwaron ko har varsh 75 hazaar karod rupye de rahi he
 This has also ensured direct help in the bank account of 82 lakh farmers of Andhra Pradesh
 is yojana par U-turn babu ne apana steekar laga diya he
 TDP and Congress have ruled Andhra Pradesh for decades, U-turn Babu has been CM for a long time
 tungabhadra or krishna jaisi nadiyon kii krupa andhra pradesh par, roilseema par rahi he
 But the farmers here are thirsty
 iskaa kaaran agar kuch he to wo inaki buree niyat he
 Polavaram Dam is a living example of this intention
 ye project 7 dashak se ban rahaa he
 Seeing the need of the farmers of Andhra Pradesh, the central government also released about 7000 crores to the state government
 lekin ye project latakta hi ja rahaa he or yahaan kii sarkaar isaki laagat badaye hi ja rahi he
 On one hand, it is malicious for the farmers and the poor, and on the other hand, your watchman has a clear intention, which is felt by every poor family
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'yahaan ke dedh lakh se adhik garibon ko apane pakke ghar mili hai, kareeb ek karod logon ke jandhan khate khole gaye hai
 The poor sisters have got more than 3 lakh free gas connections here
 ayushmaan bharat yojana kaa laabh ab tak yahaan ke 67 hazaar garib pariwaron ko ho chukaa he
 Similarly, about 40 thousand workers from Andhra Pradesh have joined the Shramayogi Maandhan Yojana
 ye jitne bhi kaam kiye gaye hai, andhra pradesh main infrastracchar ke vikaas ke liye jo bhi kaam ho rahe hai, wo or tezi se ho sakate the
 But those who run the government here could not get free time only due to political and economic development of their sons, relatives
 tidipi ke ummidavaaron kii list dekhie, usamen U-turn babu ke parivaar se jude log hi hai
 This watchman is fighting with this mentality of those who prove selfishness for their family only and only
 chaahe tidipi ho, jagan reddy kii YSR-CP ho yaa phir congress har taraf vanshavaad or parivaarwaad kaa hi bolbalaa he
 New India will be built on the spirit of opportunity, equal opportunity for all

 President Pratibha Patil has approved the recommendation to remove the CEO of Prasar Bharati
 prasar bharti ke siio bi es laali par vittiya ghotaalon ke aarope lage hai
 The President has accepted the government's appeal to the Supreme Court to investigate corruption cases against Lali
 doshi paae jane par laali ko pad se hataaya ja saktaa he
 There have been cases of corruption in cricket broadcasting rights against Lali
 raashtrapati ne isaki jaanch supreme court ke jajon se karaane kii aadesh de die hai
 According to the Constitution, the CEO of Prasar Bharati can be removed from the post only if he is convicted by the judges of the Supreme Court
 gauratlab he ki 2006 main prasar bharti pramukh kaa pad sanbhaalane vaale laali par privet prasaaran companiyon ko cricket maichon ke prasaaran adhikaron ko bechney main niyamon kii andekhi karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya he
 Lali is already under the scanner of the CVC in this case
 laali kaamanwealth prasaaran adhikaron main ghotaale ke maamle par bhi jaanch agenciyon kii najar main hai
 Official sources said that President Pratibha Patil's consent came in a reference given by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 yah prasar bharti adhinium ke tahat jaruri thi
 During the investigation, the CEO can also be suspended under the provision of the Act
 raashtrapati ke ucchtam nyaayalay kii jaanch samiti gathit karne ko hari jhandi dete hi laali ko hataae jane kii prakriya ko gati mil gai he
 There was a dispute with Prasar Bharati Board over the matter of running the organization of Lali, a 1971 batch cadre officer of Uttar Pradesh cadre
 kendriya satarkta ayog ne laali par abhiyog lagaaya tha ki unhone sansadeey visheshadhikaar kaa ulanghan kiya he, kai prasaaran companiyon ko phayda pahunchaaya he or aarthik aniyamitataayen kii hai
 Exploitation and arrest of an Indian diplomat in the United States, caught in international dignity, is an indication that there has been a deep breach in the ever-growing relationship between the two countries
 america or bharat ke bich bade dhoomadhadake ke saath ranneetik saajhedaari kaayam hui thi, na ki maalik or graahak kaa rishta
 Although the US has an owner-client relationship with its 27 strategic partners, not a partnership
 darasal saajhedaari ek tarah kii barabari or aapasi sammaan ke rishte kii maang karti he
 Perhaps because of this, America was treating India as it was with its other allies, that's why it really shocked by India's response in the case of Devyani Khobragade
 bharat ke liye yah maamla naak kaa sawaal ban gaya
 The 'problem' of India from India is not limited to this case
 masalan, duniyabar main sex yaa shramikon se judi maanav taskari ke peediton ke liye america ne jo tii-vija jari kiye hai, unamem ek-tihaai bharat ke hai
 In this way, he continues to ridicule the judiciary of the world's most populous democracy
 khobragade kii naukaraani ke parivaar ko jaise bharat se nikaalkar le jaaya gaya or jaise america duutavas ne nazaij tareeke se unke liye tex riyaayat vaala tikat hasil kiya, vah rajya kii shah se maanav taskari jaisi harakat hi dikhti he
 There are enough signs of conspiracy in this act, as Khobragade was caught as soon as America took the maid's family out of her own country on the lines of the world's police
 yah bhi na bhuuliye ki america kisi chini yaa roosi rajanyik ko kathith rup se naukaraani se durvyavhaar ke aise kisi maamle main giraftaar karne yaa jama-talaashi lene kaa dussahas nahin karata kyonki uski fouran utani hi kadi pratikriya hoti
 In fact, just a week before Khobragade's arrest, New York's bigdeal prosecutor Pritinder Singh Bharara accused several Russian diplomats and consulate officials of slapping Medicaid for $ 1
5 million
 lekin aaropon ke ujagar hone ke pehle hi unhen america chhodie kii ijaajat de di gai
 But what did India do in return for this insult? Manmohan Singh avoided it by calling it a 'minor stir'
 saare ho-halle ke baavjood bharat ne abhi tak america rajanyikon or vaanijya duutavas ke adhikariyon tathaa unke pariwaron ko hasil kuch vishesh adhikaar hi hataae hai
 This is a unique example of breathless anger
 bharat america ko dandit karne kii koi koshish nahin kar paaya
 Conversely he gave the US 1 for additional consignment of C-130J military aircraft
 01 arab dollar ke nae saude kaa tohfa thama diya
 This also made his formal apology demand meaningless
 usne apane nae rajdoot kii washington main tainaati bhi america ke jawaab tak nahin roki
 When our gregarious foreign minister calls the US nsa's infamous detective around the world as 'not a spy, just a computer study', why blame America for taking too much leeway? Nobody even asks the Indian government that it has asked the American Why have you given unilateral privileges to the staff of the Embassy and the Consulate and now withdraw them? India's slavery mentality is that it has given diplomatic concessions to the families of the officials of the American consulate, which they are not even entitled to
 apane rishtedaaron ke liye vija ke laalach main bharat ke hukmaranon ne nai dilli main america duutavas ke peeche ke raste ko band kar diya tha taaki america adhikari berokatoke american club main ja saken
 The Indian government did not even try to bring people working in American schools and non-diplomatic institutions in its country under its labor law
 in shram kanoonon ke tahat pief jamaa karnaa or iskar kaa bhugtan karnaa padataa he
 Relatives of American diplomats work in American institutions here without India's permission and do not pay income tax on their income
 bharat aise ulalanghanon ko andekha kiye rahata he jabaki agar aisa america main kiya jaataa to uske gambhir parinaam hote or shaayad jail bhi janaa padataa
 India has now asked the US Embassy to provide details of them
 to, kya duutavas ye byore degaa? koun kanoon kaa chaabuk chalaaegaa? bharat ke beridh ke hukmran?ek or sawaal kaa jawaab aana abhi baaki he—khobragade kii faraar naukaraani ke khilaaf kab bharat se gaiyr-jamaanti warrant jari hua, bharat ke imigration adhikariyon ne uske parivaar ko tii-vija par kaise baahar jane diya? yah sahi he ki kisi faraar vyakti ke parivaar ko doshi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Nevertheless, immigration and intelligence officials in India must have thought about how the family is going out on 'trafficking' visas
 jaahir he, bhartiya adhikariyon ko bahut saare jawaab dene hai
 Of course, the Indian government, who did not learn any lessons from the case of the American informer David Headley, is to blame for the new insult
 isi vajah se uskaa is maamle main sakht rukh bhi geela pataakhaa hi sabit hua, or uski memne jaisi chhavi or majboot hui
 (brahma Chelani is a world strategic expert and author) bihar main board kii pariksha de chuke chaatro kaa intjaar bhi ab jald hi khatm hone vaala he

 Students can check their result by visiting the official official website of the board

 Recently Yash Raj Films has released a video
 isamen anoushka apane kirdaar ke bare main or mechap ke bare main bataa rahi hai
 Anushka said that without makeup Mamta like Mushkil used to work for 20 minutes
 mamata ke kirdaar ke liye bindi, chuudi, gale main kaala dhaagaa pahananaa jaruri tha
 Most of all i had to take care of my hairstyle
 film main mere bal kaale rang ke or aage se karli najar aa rahe hai
 Anushka did not want to be the mother-in-law of the needle, this is the reason Anushka said, this character is very close to my heart
 jab mujhe kahani sunai gai tab maine kah diya tha ye role main kabhi nahin kar sakati hum
 Anushka Sharma said that when directors Sharat Kataria and Manish Sharma approached Anushka for the film, she was not sure whether she would be able to do justice to the character
 haalanki bahut der samajhane ke baad unhone film ke liye haa kar diya
 Anushka said, "I couldn't believe that i would be able to do this role
 maine sharat or manish ko bataaya ki aapaki kahani shandaar he or mujhe khushi he ki YRF yah film bana rahaa he
 But this character is completely opposite in terms of my personality
 "anoushka ne kaha, "main hameshaa se chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa chaahati thi lekin mujhe samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki main is kirdaar ko kaise karuungi
 "anushka told that while she and Aditya felt that she would not be able to do this role, Manish and Sharat were absolutely confident that i would do this role
 anoushka ne bataaya ki sharat unke ghar aae or phir unhen samajhaayaa ki kyon unhen aisa lagata he ki wo is kirdaar ke liye sahi actress hai
 Despite all this, Anushka said that now i feel proud that i did this film

 uma ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki baari barish ke kaaran uttrakhand main jo tabaahi machi use roka to nahin ja saktaa tha, lekin agar samay rahete kuch upaay kar liye jate to logon kii keemtee jaane jarur bachaai ja sakati thim
 He said that the rainstorm started in Uttarakhand on 14 June, which continued for the next three days
 is dauraan itnaa pani gira ki kedarnath dham ke upar sthit gandhi sarovar pani se labalab bhar gaya or usase pani bah niklaa
 Uma says that if the steps were taken in time to realize the danger after the rains started and the pilgrims were evacuated from Kedarnath and other religious places in these three days, a large number of deaths could have been avoided
 bijepi upaadhyaksh uma bharti ne kaha ki uttrakhand ke srinagar main panbizli pariyojna nirmaan ke liye pracheen evam aitihaasik dhari mata mandir visthapit kiya janaa tha or mandir se teen din pehle hi dhari mata kii murti hataai gai thi, jiske baad is parvatiy rajya main pralay jaisi sthiti nirmit hui
 The BJP vice-president said that although she does not want to say that the devastation came due to the Dhari Mata temple displacement, it is traditionally believed that Dhari Mata is the guardian mother of the devotees who visit the Char Dham and the people of Uttarakhand
 unhone kaha ki dhari mata mandir visthaapan ke khilaaf anya logon ke saath unhone bhi abhiyaan chalaaya tha, lekin unki aawaaj nahin suni gai
 He said that this step may have been taken under the pressure of the 'power mafia', who wanted to set up a large power plant in place of the temple
 uma ne kaha ki uttrakhand main kai nadiyaan hai or vahaan ke paryaavaran evam logon ke hisaab se keval ek athwa do megawatt kii choti panbizli pariyojnaayen hi acchhee hai
 However, there may also be a possibility that these small projects were not proving to be beneficial for the dominant power mafia and would like to set up large and profitable power projects there

 Expressing concern over the condition of Delhi's roads, the Delhi High Court has slammed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi for presenting a pleasant picture three months before the Commonwealth Games in October this year
 nyaayamurti kailash gambhir ne kaha, ‘‘is adaalat kii taraf se anek nirdeshon ke baavjood is adaalat ko halafnaamon main jo bataaya ja rahaa he uske bajaay tasviir adhik kharaab najar aati he
 He sought a status report from the corporation in three weeks

 The city has been brought to a standstill due to long traffic jams on most major roads
 rashtramandal khel najadik hai or is sthiti main aisi sadakon se guzarana is shahar ke liye sharmindagi kii baat he
 The court said, "it appears that the road construction work was done poorly and most of the roads do not have the capacity to bear a single rain so the condition of the roads gets worse after every season of rain
" ’ nigam kii khinchaai karte hue adaalat ne kaha, ‘lok nirmaan vibhaag or emsidi nagarikon kii haalat ko lekar puri tarah asamvedansheel hai
 While objecting to the claim made by the corporation in an affidavit regarding the testing of the standards of roads, the court said, "the condition is disappointing for motorists and vehicles are also being reduced due to plying roads

 There are more than half a dozen villages in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur and Jagdalpur where Aadhaar cards of villagers have not been produced due to the fear of Naxalites
 aadhaar card nahin hone kii vajah se graminon ko sarkari rashan dukaanon se khaane-pine kii vastuon ko kharidne ke liye kadi mashakt kerani pad rahi he
 In fact, in this village occupied by Naxalites, Naxalite leaders have issued a decree that if any villager gets the Aadhaar card made, then it is not good for him

 But the Naxalites returned him unscathed
 maare naksali khauf ke sarkari afasaron kii team ne duusari baar is gaanv kaa rukh hi nahin kiya
 But the government officials were definitely told that whoever wants to get the Aadhaar card, then they should come to the Bijapur block office
 yashobai hi nahin uske saath kai gramin teen chaar baar block offis gaye
 But his courage broke as soon as he remembered Naxalite Nafarmani
 ye log bagaiyr aadhaar card banawaye waapas apane gaanv laut aae
 On the other hand, due to lack of link of Aadhar card in government ration shops, villagers have to have two to four items for food and drink
 ye haal sirf yashobai kaa hi nahin he

 But Naxalites have kept their watch on these shops too

 Only those who have Aadhaar card will be able to provide food grains from these shops at a discounted rate

 i have been of the opinion that nothing is bigger than Sunday
 sande ghar par rahane ke liye hota he
 Sunday should not go anchoring anything
 main khud ko itnaa mahatvapurn nahin samajhnaa chahta ki big braking news main kursi chhenk kar baith jaaen
 In ten years of anchoring, i fulfilled this promise myself
 ikkaa dukka cese main hi tay slot se zyaada or chuttee ke din ankaring karne gaya hum
 This disease was seen in its predecessor masters
 reporting ke dauraan bhi isi beemaari kaa aalochak rahaa lekin ise bhi apane jivan se dur rakhane main safal rahaa
 Anchor people reach every news to understand and express themselves
 mujhe ye galat lagata tha to iskaa dhire-dhire pratikaar kiya
 Later it became a rule
 shuru main aisa hua lekin mujhe aparaadh bodh hota tha ki duusare ko hataaya
 Then my seniors began to understand this
 duniya main avasar aseemit hai
 Do not become insecure
 khud se kiya gaya yah vaada agar aap apane do dashak ke peshewar jivan main nibhaa jaaen to apane un varishton or enditivi kaa shukriya to banataa he jinhone meri is baat ko samajha
 There is a temptation in TV to be seen all the time
 is laalach se dur rahaa
 There is no further address, but two decades remained
 jab bhi prastaav or dabaav aayaa manaa hi kiya
 Many idealess editors came into the world of Hindi channels, launched channels and molded themselves to the same format to work from five in the morning
 baarah baje raat ko ghar lauto
 Sit in the studio by yourself in every news
 acha hua ki mujhe channel launch karne yaa chalaane kaa mauka nahin mila lekin main maanata hum ki ye sab karne vaale hindi tivi kii patrakarita ko satahi or lokapriy kaaryakramon ke alaava kuch or nahin de sake
 He definitely remained important
 har samay daftar main hone kii juthi patibaddhta odhe rahe
 It is called busy body in English
 jo bhi nae patrkaar is tarah kaa labaadaa odhe rahete hai ki ve din raat kaam karte hai wo is baat se seekhen
 If you want to learn from the editors with a busy body, then look carefully at what they have done with the commitment of being in the office day and night
 khub padhie
 Have fun khaanaa bananaa seekhen or ghoomana
 Do not think that i work less
 lekin apana hasil yahi he ki kam kaam karo
 Do it with planning and do it with newness
 har samay lokapriyata kii khumaari mat paalo
 Work in TV but never watch news channels
 aap tivi ke patrkaar hai
 It is said to make inferior goods
 dekhne ke liye to koi nahin kahata hoga na
 i am not writing to show this greatness but to say that the job of the channel eats life
 aap jivan ko bachaaen
 i lost
 maine apana koi kaarykram ghar lautakar nahin dekha
 Neither watched Kiran Bedi's interview nor did i see my spoof made on Akshay Kumar's interview

 Now let's talk about today
my biggest grief and anguish about agsit pole ko lekar meraa sabase bada dukh or gussa yah he ki mujhe sande ke din ankaring kerani padi
 Since being called for the first time in a whole year, it also went respectfully
 to us din shaam saadhe paanch baje offis gaya
 Never looked and watched the monitor silently
 bade channelon ne kaafii paisa ausat or ghatiya program banane par karch kar rakhaa tha
 This is the economics of channels
 formet par karodon karch kar dete hai lekin maanavsansaadhan par paanch rupaya nahin
 So studios are left in the big channels and talent is missing
 wo kisi channel ko nahin chahie
 Now you tell me
 maine koi taiyaari nahin kii
 My channel did not spend on the five rupee exit poll
 mere liye graphix vaala helicopter tak nahin banaaya gaya jisamen main ud sakuun
 i kept anchoring on foot
 paanch baje tak sochaa bhi nahin tha ki kise bulaaen kise nahin
 Anandi, Revati and Sudeep were spoken
 isse adhik kuch na sochaa or na kiya
 My show is also average
 puri vinamrata se kah rahaa hum
 Still, why do you tell that this show with zero investment is trending on youtube from Monday afternoon to Tuesday afternoon at number one? Why have you got two million views on NDTV India youtube channel? Why are 13 million views on NDTV (english) youtube channel?

 However, despite the plot and drama, the condition of the Sri Lankan team has deteriorated
 darasal tii ke baad jaise hi lanka ko laga ki viraat tihare shatak kii ore bad rahe hai, ye timsmog kaa bahanabanakar match rokane lagi
 For the first time, the match was halted for about 20 minutes
 ek ballebaaj jo isse krooj kar rahaa tha ab wo jhalla rahaa tha
 The Lanka team was teasing with a mask on the mouth, the team from Lanka believed it was smog, it was enough
 magar yahi smog ampiron ke liye bhi tha, bhartiya ballebaajon ke liye bhi
 Did Sri Lankan players descend from Jannat, who were feeling poisoned by the wind? jaale par namak tha kabhi coach, kabhi manager kaa maidan par aana
 Lanka teams were making fun of what was going on
 agar lanka ko nahin khelnaa tha to uske captain ekadam inkaar kar sakate the
 But he was neither refusing nor agreeing

 These same incidents took Virat's wicket, surpassing him with his third century

 jab dashakon tak lanka aatankwaad se jujh rahaa tha ye bharat kii team thi jo hameshaa vahaan ke daure karti rahi
 Sri Lanka team's condition in the match is thin favor, not only has it not happened, the team of Lanka has been drinking
 shaayad haar kaa dar is kadar ghar kar gaya he ki iske captain kaa dimag kaam karnaa band kar chukaa he
 When the limit was exceeded, Virati declared the innings
 uske baad lankai khilaadiyon ke chehre khil uthe
 But his happiness lasted only for a few minutes
 bhartiya gendbaajon ne jald hi is kheme main khauf bhar diya
 The Sri Lankan team looked completely under pressure from the hosts until the two-day game
 duusare din ke khel khatm hone tak srilanka ne 44
 131 runs were scored at the loss of 3 wickets in 3 overs
 srilankai cricketron ke is ravaiye par bhartiya team ke gendbaaji coach bharat arun ne kaha ki mehmaan team ke khilaadiyon kaa dhyaan shaayad pradooshan par tha, match par nahin
 In the second session of the day, more than five Sri Lankan players landed on the ground wearing masks due to pollution
 is par bharat ne kaha ki viraat ne takreeban do din tak ballebaaji kii lekin unhone mask nahin pahana
 Virat Kohli broke the rhythm of repeated matches? In the second session of the day, Sri Lanka bowler Lahiru Gamage was troubled and stopped when India were on 509 runs losing five wickets

 The match resumed once the game was halted for five minutes, but five balls later Sri Lankan captain Dinesh Chandimal stopped the match due to having 10 players and meanwhile, coach of the Sri Lankan team Nick Pothas came to the ground to talk to the umpires
 isi bich bhartiya dressing room se kohli ne pareshaan hokar pari ghoshit kar di
 Ravi Shastri was also surprised to stop the match, he said that for the umpires on the field and the match is the referee, this is the issue
 khilaadiyon kaa kaam jaakar virodh pradarshan karnaa nahin he
 When the game was stopped without any reason, we wanted the match to continue, because our focus is on this Test match and we want to win it
 maidan par shastri kii ampiron se kya baat hui is par gendbaaji coach ne kaha, ravi ne saaf taur par kaha tha ki match ko jari rakhen roke nahin

 There was an uproar about the pitch in Nagpur about three months ago and the ICC also raised questions
 lekin is baar spinners kaa jor chalaa he to kya ise lekar sawaal uthaae ja sakate hai

 ' Questions were raised on the pitch due to the Indian batsmen dancing in front of the New Zealand spin on the spinning track of Nagpur
 purv srilankai captain kumaar sangakara or west indies ke purv captain bryan lara is pich ko world tii-20 ke liye adarsh pich nahin maanate
 But many experts question the ability of even more batsmen to adapt themselves to the situation
 purv srilankai captain kumaar sangakaara kehete hai, "donon hi tiimon ne spin gendbaazi ko khilne main aakshamata dikhaai
 The Indian team has a great record against spin
 lekin nagpur main ye timen spin ke khilaaf juujhati dikhin
 " purv bhartiya captain sunil gavaskar ne to yahaan tak kaha ki agar bharat match jeet jaataa to pich par sawaal nahin uthte
 By the way, the spin bowlers had wreaked havoc on the Nagpur pitch almost four months ago
 In the two innings of the Nagpur Test, the South African spinners were the two wickets of South Africa
 bharat ne wo test match teen dinon main hi jeet liya tha
 But the ICC raised questions about it
 lekin captain emes dhoni ne bhi pich ko nahin balki is haar ke liye apane ballebaazon ko latada he
 The pitches for the World T20 tournament have been prepared under the direction of the ICC and many experts consider the spinning track as a sporty track
