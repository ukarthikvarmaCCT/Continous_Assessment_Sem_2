 Why don't you have the courage to remove AFSPA? afjal guru ko faansee diye jane ke baad aap use waapas nahin laa sakate lekin afspa hathaaye jane ke baad aap ise phir se lagu kar sakate hai
 He said, "when we talk of AFSPA, we are told that you are putting the state in danger, i do not understand when we will be ready for use in Jammu and Kashmir, why always selective policy is adopted , When this state government loudly said that hanging Afzal Guru would worsen the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, you ignored it, it was your right

 unhone kaha ki centre ko bayaan dene ke bajaay kashmiri logon ke dil or dimag ko jeetne kaa prayaas karnaa chaiye
 Omar said, 'there are some areas where we do not need the army where we can face challenges by ourselves, give us six months, nothing will fall, the sky will not fall, i will keep asking to remove AFSPA

 puri jaankaree hamane police mukhyalay se maangi he or uske baad ukt patr kaa uttar bheja jaayegaa

 In such a situation, according to their understanding, the governor can be called to get a majority

 aise main ucchtam nyaayalay ne bhi yahi kaha ki jald se jald bahumat kaa pareekshan kiya jaae
 Regarding the Congress's claim of having more numbers, they say that even the Supreme Court said that if they have more numbers then go to the Governor
 jab unhone clem hi nahin kiya ki unke paas adhik number hai to phir yah kaise mana jaae ki ve sankhya main adhik hai
 In such a situation, they should show their strength in the House

 The sensational revelation of female students being sexually abused in a madrasa located in Sahadatganj area of lucknow has been revealed
 shuukravaar kii raat police dwaara kii gai chhapemari main madrase se 51 ladakiyon ko mukt karaayaa gaya
 When the liberated girls revealed the game of sin going on inside the madrasa, everyone's senses flew away
 darasal madrase main rah rahi chaatraon main se ek chaatra ne chitthee likhakar madrase ke andar apane upar ho rahe atyaacharon ko bayaan kiya he
 He threw this letter out of the seminary in the hope of helping
 haalanki ye ladkiyaan is kadar dari hui thim ki unhone chitthee main kai jagah par padhakar chitthee faad dene kii baat kahi he
 But somehow this letter got caught in the hands of the police and the black letter of the exploits in the madrasa opened
 chaatraon ne madrasa jamiya khadijul kubra ke manager mohammad taiyab jiyaa par madrase kii ladakiyon kaa yon shoshan karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 According to the students, Tayyab Jiya used to sexually abuse girls in the madrasa
 aaropee manager giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 a girl studying in obscene dance motherhood had got her writing written and made her objection
 chitthee ke mutabik, madrase ke kaaji kii madrase main padhane vaali bacchiyon par buree najar thi
 According to sources, the Kazi of the madrasa used to get girls to do obscene dance
 apni karatootein chhipaane ke liye kaaji ladakiyon ko daraata dhamkata bhi tha
 Due to this, the girls were silent till now, but now the pot of Kazi's sin has broken out
 roj kichan main ladakiyon ko bulaata tha kajimadarase main ladakiyon ke saath ho rahe atyaachaar kaa khulaasa teen pej kii jis chitthee se hua, usamen aise-aise khulaase hue hai ki ankhen fatty rah jaaen
 The girl writing the letter states that Qazi goes to the kitchen everyday and calls the girls
 chitthee main vah aage likhti he ki ek raat kaaji ne ek ladki ko kichan main bulaayaa tha or uske saath bahut bura kiya
 The girl's pain has completely spilled in the letter, 'it is very inappropriate'
 vah saaf-saaf likhti he ki unke madrase kaa kaaji bahut hi budtameez he
 The girls want to return, but Kazi holds them here forcibly
 madrase main ladakiyon kaa na sirf yon shoshan hota tha, balki unke saath marpet or duusari or haivaaniyat bhi hoti thi
 It would be right to imprison it not a madrasa
 padhakar faad dena chittheekaanpate haathon se aadi tedi likhaawat main darj ladakiyon kii aapbeetee bataati he ki is madrase main ladkiyaan kis kadar dar-dar kar rahati thim
 In many places in the letter it is written that after tearing it, read it
 unhen dar tha ki chitthee kii sachai saamne aane par unhen or bhi pratadit kiya ja saktaa he
 The life of girls studying in this madrasa was made hell, this letter is the proof of that
 kaaji ke saath mili hui thi ek mahila staffmadarase main yon utpeedan kii shikaar ladakiyon kii dastaan bayaan karne vaali chitthee main madrase main hi kaam karne vaali ek mahila par kaaji ke saath santhganth kaa bhi khulaasa hua he
 It is written in the letter, "there is a girl Naz who lives in his (kazi) office
" usne ladakiyon se kaha he ki jo vah kahegi wo karnaa padegaa
 But we cannot do this, because it is a question of our respect
 "jaan se maarane kii dhamkiaisa bhi nahin he ki madrase main ladakiyon ne kabhi apane upar ho rahe atyaacharon kaa virodh nahin kiya
 But if you read his full story recorded in the letter, it is known that he was even threatened with death
 chitthee main saaf-saaf likhaa he 'ye ham sabko bahut martha he
 Do not tell this thing to anyone
 agar wo jaan jayega to ham logon ko maaregaa
 Throw it reading, please do not tear it down
 'gauratlab he ki is madrase main 125 ladkiyaan padhati hai, jinamein se 51 chatraayen yahaan maujuud thim, jinhen mukt kara liya gaya he
 Most of the girls rescued are minors
 inamen se 9 ladkiyaan bihar kii, 2 ladkiyaan nepal kii or baaki ladkiyaan uttar pradesh ke alag-alag hisson kii hai
 After receiving the letter, the police of several police stations including SP (west) Vikas Chandra Tripathi of Lucknow, along with the women police, killed Red last night and rescued about 51 girls
 ladakiyon ko nari niketan bhej diya gaya he
 Some of the girls have been handed over to their families
 shesh bacchiyon ko aaj court main pesh kiya jayega
 When these girls will narrate their incidents in the court, this school of sin and the teachings of Qazi and black acts of sin will come before the world

 bhartiya raksha mantri manohar parrikarne kaha he ki rafel ladaaku vimaan deal par sawaal khadaa karke purv raksha mantri eke anthony ne isaki hatya kar di he
 During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to France, India had 126 deal with France for $ 25 billion fighter jets
 parrikar ne somvaar ko kaha tha ki france ke saath 25 billian dollar vaali 126 ladaaku vimaanon kii deal mushkil main pad sakati he
 He said that all future negotiations for the purchase of French Rafale fighter jets will be directly between the two governments and there will be no direct talks with the aircraft manufacturers
 parrikar ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki lagata he upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal main raksha mantri rahe antni ne ise galat samaj liya he
 Parrikar said, "the former defense minister had questioned the deal itself about the prices
 jiske parinamswaroop ye deal hamaare liye behad mushkil ho sakati thi
 Apart from this, Parrikar also targeted Congress leader Digvijay Singh
 digvijay ne haal hi main parrikar ko lekar twit kar kaha tha ki, parrikar goa main machhlee kharid rahen hai, jab modi france main ladaaku vimaan order kar rahe hai
 Parrikar replied, "digvijay Singh must eat fish
" isse unka dimag tej hoga
 Earlier, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar on Monday made it clear that India will not be able to get its first Rafale aircraft before two and a half years
 2011 main bhartiya vaayu sena ne rafel nirmaataa company dasolt se 25 billian dollar main 126 vimaanon kaa sauda kiya tha
 Now this deal is renewed
 jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hatane ke baad bharat-pakistan ke bich tanaav he
 After this decision of the Government of India, there is an outrage in the neighboring country of Pakistan and it is seeking sympathy for itself on the world stage
 isi silsile main pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi apane sabase 'bharosemand dost' china kaa darwaja khatkhatane pahunche
 Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi claimed that China has admitted that India's aggressive attitude has upset the people of Kashmir and put the people of the entire region in danger
 haalanki china ko lekar pakistan ke is daawey kii pushti nahin ho saki he
 According to Pakistan, it wants to bring peace and stability, which China has supported
 pakistan kaa kahana he ki vah china ke saath milakar kashmir ke logon kii aawaaj ke duniya ke saamne uthayega
 Please tell that India's Foreign Minister s Jaishankar is also on a three-day visit to China
 videsh mantri es jaishankar kaa ye pehla china daura he
 His visit is happening when India announced last week to abolish Article 370, which gives special status to Jammu and Kashmir
 iske saath hi bharat ne ladakh ko centre shasit pradesh banane kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Beijing had objected to this decision of the Indian government
 china kaa kahana he ki bharat sarkaar kaa ye faisla uski 'kshetreey akhandta' kaa ulanghan karata he
 China has been making illegal claims on 'aksai Chin' adjacent to Ladakh
 jabaki ye ilaaka saalon se jammu-kashmir rajya kaa hissaa rahaa he
 China's statement on Article 370 has been balanced so far, but given its interests in Pakistan, China can give an anti-india statement
 haalanki is vakt antarrashtriya patal par teen aise jwalanth mudde hai jinpar china duniya bhar main ghir rahaa he
 These issues are those three weak pulse of China, due to which China will hesitate to take action against India on Jammu and Kashmir
 honkong main pradarshnahankong main is vakt pratyrpan bill ke khilaaf jabardast pradarshan chal rahaa he
 The bill provides that criminals may be extradited to China for prosecution
 is bill kaa honkong main vyapak virodh ho rahaa he
 The bill has been linked by the people of Hong Kong to their democratic rights
 honkong prashasan or china kii sarkaar is pradarshan ko kuchalane par amada he
 China cannot justify the possible demonstrations in Jammu and Kashmir by crushing the democratic movement in Hong Kong
 agar china sanyukt raashtra main jammu-kashmir kaa mudda uthaane main pakistan ko sahyog detaa he to bharat bhi honkong main pradarshan ke loktantric adhikaar or chini sarkaar dwaara daman kaa mudda uthaa saktaa he
 Recently, Britain was enraged when Britain commented on the condition of Hong Kong
 china ne kaha tha ki honkong ab china ganraajya kaa ek vishesh prashasnic kshetra he or ab yah britain kaa upnivesh nahin he
 Uygar Muslims The repression of Chinese communist rule over 1 million Uygar Muslims in Xinjiang province of China has become an important issue of human rights abuses
 emnesti international ke alaava kai duusare atanrarashtriya sanghathanon ne china ke is kadam kii ninda kii he
 According to human rights organization Amnesty International, the Chinese government has been pressurizing the Muslims there to disobey their religious views
 report ke mutabik lagbhag 30 kaidakhaanon main takreeban 10 lakh muslimon ko band kar diya he
 The Chinese government is trying to erase the cultural and religious identity of Muslims here
 duniyabar main muslim adhikaron kaa champion banane kaa daawa karne vaala pakistan uigar muslimon ke utpeedan par shant he
 If Pakistan falsely accuses India of harassing the citizens of Jammu and Kashmir in the United Nations and China supports it, then India can open the pole of China on the world stage by telling the world the reality of Uygar Muslims
 tibet muddatibet par is vakt bhale china ne kabja jamaa rakhaa ho, lekin tibet kii aazaadee kii maang yahaan bhi samay-samay par uthati rahi he
 When India removed Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, the response of the President of Tibet's exile government living in India also came to light
 tibet kii nirvasit sarkaar ke raashtrapati lobsang saange ne bharat sarkaar ke is faisle ko 'aantarik mudda' qaraar diya or is par koi pratikriya nahin di
 Lobsang Sangay said on 8 August, "we do not comment on India's internal issues, this is the decision of the Government of India
" " iske saath hi lobsang saange ne bharat sarkaar se apil kii ki tibet kii swaayatata ke mudde par nai dilli vichaar kare
 Although the Indian government cares about China's sentiments before commenting on Tibet, India can also reconsider its stand if China tries to interfere in Jammu and Kashmir
 bollywood ke star kids main khushi kapur aajkal surkhiyon main hai
 Legendary actress Sridevi's daughter Khushi joined her friend Alia Kashyap's birthday shortly before
 party ke badakhushi ne kuch tasviren instagram par share kin
 The problem arose when some negative and ugly comments came on those photos
 lekin khushi ne himmat na haarate hue apni figure or body par hue caments kaa karaara jawaab diya he
 i post my pictures because i feel good and confident
 i put out these pictures not because i want to show off or try to be anyone or anything else
 i have my own sense of style and my own way to think and me putting out a picture that's accessible to so many people is taken more of an opportunity to judge me or my looks, clothes or anything else
 i put something out there because it's something i feel good about, everyone is entitled to have their own opinion but putting someone else down because of it is not making you any better of a person
 Please think twice before you decide to comment something rude or offensive, it's not a joke
 It's sad how in this day and age where feminism is finally getting the attention it deserves, girls still feel the need to tear each other down and indulge in body shaming
 i don't care if you think my stomach pops out or if i don't fit into your idea of beautiful, but for your own conscience please realize that having such narrow minded opinions of people makes you an ugly person inside
 i truly believe everyone is beautiful in their own way, why can't we all celebrate that and encourage each other
 There is only one of you, embrace your beauty, and don't rain on my parade when I'm confident enough to embrace mine
 i hope that whatever it is that frustrates you enough to be so cruel will one day go away, because some people might actually take your snide remarks seriously, and i know from experience it can hurt
 Let's be kind to one another, love always xa photo posted by Khushi Kapoor☽ (@khushikapoorr) onjan 12, 2016 at 8:10 am PST Khushi writes that she posts her photos because she is full of confidence

 K
 sivan ne chandrayan-2 kii lonching se pehle hi kaha tha ki chand par vikram lander ko utarane main 15 minute lagenge
 This landing will be extremely difficult and complex
 isamen kuch bhi anhoni ho sakati he
 So these will be '15 Minutes of Terror' or '15 Minutes of Fear'
 agar is 15 minute main sab kuch sahi rahaa to ham itihaas rachenge
 On September 7, Vikram's landing at the south pole of the moon took just 15 minutes
 shuruaati 13 minute tak sab sahi rahaa lekin aakhri ke 2 minute main is bhay ko pukhta kar diya, jisaki ashanka thi
 Chandraman-2's Vikram Lander 2
 1 kimi kii oonchai par apane tay maarg se disha badali or 335 meter kii oonchai par aate-aate uskaa ground stesan se sampark tut gaya
 Let us know when and where the word '15 Minutes of Terror' came from
 It was on 6 August 2012, that is, about seven years before the moon landing of Chandrayaan-2
 america antariksh agency nasa (NASA) ne november 2011 main mangal grah ke liye apana curiosity lander launch kiya tha
 The curiosity lander was to land on Mars on August 6, 2012, about 10 months later
 ise mangal ke orbit (kaksha) se uski sataha par utarane main kareeb 7 minute lagane vaale the
 This landing was very complicated
 jaraa si bhi chook hoti to curiosity kaa vahi haal hota jo aaj chandrayan-2 ke vikram lander kaa hua he
 2
 1 KM nahin, 335 meter par tutaa tha vikram se ISRO kaa sampark, ye graph he sabootmangal kii sataha par landing karne ke liye jaataa curiosity mars rover
 (graphics- NASA / JPL) At that time, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of NASA was in full command of the landing in the hands
 jepiel hi curiosity kii landing par nigaraanee rakh rahi thi
 The curiosity's landing was also scheduled to happen automatically
 is puri prakriya main saat minute lagane vaale the
 That's why JPL scientists called it '7 Minutes of Terror', ie '7 minutes of fear'
 curiosity ek chote car kii aakaar vaala rover tha
 It was to be taken off the surface of Mars by covering it in a heat shield
 1 saal ke liye gaya tha chandrayan-2 kaa orbitor, jaaniye kaise 7 saal tak karata rahegaa kammangal kii sataha se 12 kimi upar khul gaya tha parashutehit shield ne mangal grah ke vayumandal main jab pravesh kiya tab gharshan kii vajah se vah 1600 degree celsius taapmaana kaa saamana kar rahaa tha
 At that time his speed was 1609 km per hour
 mangal kii sataha se 12 kimi kii oonchai par ek bada parachute khulaa or hitashield ko lekar mangal kii sataha kii ore badhane laga
 Its speed then was 1448 km per hour
 9 kimi kii oonchai par hitashield neeche se hat gaya or curiosity rover dikhne laga
 Its speed then was 595 km per hour
 curiosity mars rover kii landing ke liye 12 kimi kii oonchai par kholaa gaya tha parachute
 (graphics- NASA / JPL) was launched via Sky Crane The curiosity had a robotic cover above the curiosity even after the removal of the Roverheetshield
 ise ski kraine naam diya gaya tha
 It was the same as Vikram's cover over our Pragyan Rover
 iske baad shuru hua paward decent
 That is, by turning on the thrusters in the robot, the same landing as our Vikram lander had to do
 8 thrusters ko on karke curiosity kii gati ko 3
 Launched at a speed of 21 km
 kareeb 25 feet kii oonchai par aane ke baad ski kraine ne curiosity rover ko taron ke jariye mangal kii sataha ke upar lataka diya
 When the speed of the sky crane fell to zero, the Curiosity rover landed on the surface of Mars and cut the wires
 iske baad ski kraine rover se thodaa dur jaakar land kar gaya
 What kind of reward? Prior to Chandrayaan-2, the government landed a slightly distant ISRO scientists' salaried crane curiosity rover after landing on the surface of Mars
 (graphics- nasa / jepiel)12 june ko sivan ne kaha tha - vikram kii landing 'bhay ke 15 minute' hongeisro chairman dow
 k Sivan said in a press conference on June 12 that the most difficult part of this mission for us is to have a successful and safe landing on the lunar surface
 chandrayan-2 chandramaa kii sataha se 30 kimi kii oonchai se neeche aayega
 It will take about 15 minutes for it to come to the lunar surface
 yah 15 minute isro ke liye behad kathin hoga
 Because ISRO is going to do such a mission for the first time

 is rat hole khadaan main avaidh tareeke se khanan kaa kaam kiya ja rahaa tha jisamen ek chote si sunrag ke jariye kareeb 20 majdoor andar utre the
 The National Green Tribunal has banned this type of mining since 2004
 yahaan ke purvi jayantiya hills jile kii khadaan main ye majdoor beete 13 disambar se fanse hue hai
 Meanwhile, the state government has stopped the rescue operation this week as it requires a high power pump which can draw water out of the pit
 beete dinon main kareeb 20 khadaan majdoor is 370 foot gahari khadaan main utre the
 The mine is so narrow that only one person can descend at a time
 sthaneey logon ke kahana he ki anjaane main kisi ek majdoor ne surang kii diwaar ko tod diya jisaki vajah se paas kii nadi kaa pani andar ghusane laga
 After this somehow 5 laborers managed to get out
 haalanki mazdooron ke parijanon ko ummid he ki baaki log bhi isi tarah se baahar nikal aaenge
 Rescue government fails? Shillong Times Editor P
 mukhim iske liye meghalaya sarkaar ko doshi maanate hai
 He says that the government has always denied illegal mining and the lie has now come out of this accident
 jile ke ek varisht police adhikari ne news agency pitiai ke bataaya ki gaanv vaale is haadasa ke bare main chupa rahe the kyonki unhen khanan maalikon se kisi tarah ke nuksaan kaa khatra tha
 In Rat hole mining, very narrow tunnels are mined
 yah tarika behad khatarnaak, avaigyanik or jokhim bharaa he
 Rat hole mining has been banned, but in many areas of Meghalaya, mining is done in the same manner
 police adhikari ne bataaya ki itane bade haadase ke baad bhi abtak rajya ke aapadaa vibhaag ke mantri ne ghatnasthal kaa daura nahin kiya he or na hi kisi tarah ke muaavje kaa elaan kiya gaya he
 On the accident, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi by tweeting
 unhone kaha ki 15 majdoor khadaan main fanse hue hai or pradhanmantri brij par poj de rahe hai
 His government has also refused to provide pumps for rescue
 15 miners have been struggling for air in a flooded coal mine for two weeks
 Meanwhile, PM struts about on Bogibeel Bridge posing for cameras
 His government refuses to organise high pressure pumps for the rescue
 PM please save the miners

 saath hi us NDRF kii jo rajya kii aapadaa team ko akele chhodkar chali gai
 Hazarika says that they have neither sufficient means nor skill to deal with this kind of disaster
 unhone kaha ki rat hole mining kii ek puraa jaal meghalaya main kaam kar rahaa he
 Congress leader H

 em
 Shangliang says that when the government of Thailand can take help of international teams in rescue operations during your time, why is this government not doing so
 kya wo khadaan majdoor ko bachaane ke liye gambhir nahin he
 Former NDRF DIG Naveen Kumar says that even though the state government is not ready for this, the NDRF is fully prepared
 unhone kaha ki agar pani nikaalane kii saadhan muhaiyaa karaae jate to mazdooron ko khadaan se nikaalnaa mumkin tha
 The biggest test of youth is that they should not get emotional about any promise and debate about the job
 na to congress kii taraf se bhavuk hon na bijepi kii taraf se
 You have seen during the job series how the selection commissions in many states of the country have humiliated and tortured the youth
 paanch saal main modi sarkaar aisi vyavastha nahin bana saki jisase privet sector or sarkari sector main naukariyon kii sahi sahi sankhya kaa pataa chale
 When you come to the mention of UP Bihar, the emotional spokespersons are reaching the TV studio, you see what they are speaking
 kahin aisa to nahin ki hindu muslim ke supplement ke taur par upi bihar kaa dibet chaalu kar diya gaya he
 The State Selection Commissions have four years of examinations and the exams are not completed
 pariksha hoti he to riselt nahin aata or riselt aata he to kai maheenon tak jwining nahin hoti he
 Is any leader or channel emotional about it? kamalnath kaa bayaan padhein
 He has given the clarification but goes ahead with the original statement
 unhone kaha he bahut saare log udyog main lag jate hai, anya pradeshon se aa jate hai, bihar uttar pradesh se, main unki aalochana nahin karnaa chahta hum, par madhya pradesh ke noujvaan rojgaar se vanchit ho jate hai
 Seventy percent employment will be local
 kya aisa kehane vaale kamalnath pehle mukhyamantri hai? upi bihar chhodie, kya madhyapradesh ke naujavaanon ko hi nae mukhyamantri ke bayaan par utsahit ho janaa chahie? meraa anubhav kahata he ki bilkul utsahit nahin hona chahie
 You read Kamal Nath
 ab aapako amit shah kaa bayaan dikhaata hum
 This statement is from January 2017
 upi vidhansabha chunaav ke vakt bijepi ne apane ghoshnaa patr main kaha tha ki udyogon main 90 pratishat naukariyon upi ke yuvaaon ko milengi
 Amit Shah had said, in the next five years, 70 lakhs promise to the people of Uttar Pradesh to create employment and self-employment opportunities
 mitro uttar pradesh main sthapit har udyog main 90 pratishat naukari uttar pradesh ke yuvaaon ko hi mili, ham sunishchit karte hai
 Friends, the process of filling all the vacant government posts will be started within 90 days of forming the government
 jab amit shah ne upi kii industry main upi ke 90 pratishat naujavaanon ko naukari dene kii baat kahi thi tab bihar ke kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne dharna pradarshan kiya tha
 Did the leaders of Madhya Pradesh or Jharkhand or Bengal or Maharashtra take to the streets? Now the youth of UP should ask their government which factory has been set up in the last one year in which 90 percent of the jobs have been given to the youth of UP
 paanch saal main 70 lakh rojgaar srujit karne kaa vaada tha
 It has been a year and a half, has 21 million jobs and self-employment been created
 kya koi pramaan de saktaa he? amit shah se ye sawaal kiijie or yahi sawaal aap kamalnath se bhi thode dinon baad kijiega
 Listen to both of them again to remember
 janvari 2017 main amit shah ne to yah bhi kaha tha ki teen maheene ke bheetar sabhi rikt padon par bharti kii jaaegi
 Can Amit Shah or Chief Minister Adityanath only tell how many vacant posts of government departments were filled within 90 days as promised
 kya yahi bataa sakate hai ki upi sarkaar ke bheetar kitne rikt pad hai or uske bhare jane kii kya dedline he? ek udhaaharan se is baat ko samajhie
 The promise was that UP would fill the vacant posts within 90 days
 disambar 2016 main shikshakon ke 12,460 padon kii bahaali nikali thi
 He was counseled in March 2016
 30 march 2017 ko niyukti patr milanaa tha
 But Akhilesh's government went and BJP government came
 nai sarkaar ne yah kahkar roak laga di ki ham samiksha karenge
 a year passed in the name of review
 12,460 shikshakon kaa sabar tuutane laga
 Many times i met the Chief Minister, met the Minister, nothing happened
 ant main jaakar unhone 15 march 2018 ko bijepi mukhyalay ke baahar dharna diya, 16 march ko mantri anupama jaisawal ke ghar kaa gheraav kiya
 The promise to fill the vacant posts in 90 days could not be fulfilled
 adaalat ke aadesh ke baad bhi sabhi ko naukari nahin mili he
 a few thousand have been received, but several thousand youngsters have been waiting for joining for many months even after the results
 kya aap inke liye upi bihar kaa dibet karnaa chahenge, kya koi netaa he inaki ladaai ladane vaala
 We featured this issue several times in our job series in prime time
 kamalnath ke bayaan ko lekar jitne bhi tivi channelon par dibet hue hai un sabko dekhie or prime time ke is episod ko bhi dekhie
 Determine yourself whether sentimentality was being cultivated in the name of UP Bihar, or really serious questions about the job were being answered
 isiilie kahata hum ki naukari ke sawaal ko lekar eemaandaar or sajag bane rahanaa hoga
 The spokespersons coming to the TV studios have not come to talk about jobs for the youth of UP Bihar but have come to defend their party and their leader
 game ko samajhie pehle
 Crores of rupees are used for publicity in the name of Investor Summit
 vahiin udyogpati har rajya ke invester summit main jaakar mukhyamantriyon kii tarif karata he
 Millions are spent on advertising in the media and transporting industrialists
 daawey hote hai ki kai lakh karod ke emoyu ho gaye magar media report se pataa chalata he ki zyaadaatar daawey badha chadhaakar kiye jate hai, zamin par khaas nahin hota
 When there was no factory, no investment, then where did the local people get employment
 ab jab yah fail ho gaya to sarkaron ne ek tarika nikaala ki jin udyogon ko sarkaar se riyaayaten milengi unhen 70 se 90 fisadi naukari sthaneey naujavaanon ko dena padegaa
 Has the local youth got employment by doing so? aap pataa kar len
 In 2012, when the BJP government was in Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that 50 percent of the industries that will be established in the state will be given employment to the local people and the industries which will give employment to 90 percent of the youth will be given tax exemption for two years
 will be given
 main yah udhaaharan isliye de rahaa hum taaki shivaraj singh chouhan or mukhyamantri kamalnath donon pehle yah bataaen ki 2012 se 2018 ke bich madhyapradesh main kitne udyog lage, unamem rajya ke kitne yuvaaon ko rojgaar mila
 Avinash Nair has filed a report in Indian Express dated 26 September 2018
 is report main mukhyamantri vijay rupani kaa bayaan chapa he
 His government is going to make laws soon that whichever industry will be set up there, 80 percent of the work will have to be given to Gujarati youth
 gujarat main 1995 ke ek sarkari prastaav ke anusaar 15 saal se adhik samay se rahane vaale yuvaaon ko sthaneey mana gaya he
 The Express had also reported that 92 percent of the work in 4700 large industries was given to the local people
 gujarat ke alaava himachal pradesh ne bhi isi tarah ke kadam uthaae hai
 In July, the Tribune reported that 80 per cent of the jobs in the state's industries would be given to local youth
 pehle 70 fisadi kota tha jise nai sarkaar ne badhaakar 80 fisadi kar diya
 The Tribune newspaper wrote that due to this rule, existing investors will have to remove 10 percent of the people from work and bring in the youth
 iske baad kya hua, hamen nahin maaloom
 There is so much carelessness and rigging in the matter of statistics that hundreds of reporters are needed to find the right things which i do not have
 isiilie main alag-alag sorce se soochnaaon kaa sangrah karata hum taaki ek tasviir dikhe, jise koi saamne nahin aane dena chahta he
 Gujarat's industry body, Himachal's industry body has all criticized such rules and announcements
 kai baar aise kaam bhi hote hai jinke liye sthaneey str par na to pratibha hoti he or na hi sthaneey logon kii usamen dilchaspee
 The Hindustan Times reported on 3 February 2017 that the Kannada Development Authority produced a report suggesting that 80 per cent of the clerical jobs and 65 per cent of the jobs in high-efficiency work were to keep local youth
 vahaan to congress kii sarkaar he
 Let him tell Amit Shah that we have given jobs to so many people
 amit shah upi kaa data congress ke netaa ko bataa den
 In November 2014, the Economic Times reported that the then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had made a policy of giving 70 per cent jobs to the local youth
 sari bahes bhavukta ko lekar he
 Political parties do not come forward on the question of jobs, but as soon as the scope of sentiment is seen, they come running as they fight for employment day and night
 kyon nahin centre or rajya sarkaron ke paas rojgaar ko lekar koi vishwasaneey aankada he
 There are often reports that jobs are declining
 nai naukariyaan nahin ban rahi hai
 Just two or three days ago, there was news that 3
5 million jobs have been lost since demonetisation in the traders, micro, small and medium sectors
 aal india menuphacturer association ne 34,000 chote bade kaarobaaron kaa survey karakar yah nateeja bataaya tha
 35 lakh people lost their jobs
 ek karod se zyaada prabhavit hue, kya is par charchaa hui, kya tab nahin hui to ab ho rahi he
 We should stop getting emotional by linking the question of jobs to the UP Bihar context
 privet chhodie kuch sarkari naukariyon kaa haal bataata hum
 The slogan of Ujjwal Das and Kanchan Das Amar Rahe, the body is that of Ujjwal Das who died on 17 December
 ujjwal ko lathicharge main gambhir chot ai thi
 Due to worsening financial condition he could not get treatment due to which he died
 somvaar se pehle ravivaar ko yani 16 disambar ko mahila va bal kalyaan mantri dow louis marandi ke ghar ke baahar dharna de rahe kanchan das kii maut ho gai
 The minister located outside Dumka died outside the house
 kanchan mantri ke ghar ke is tambu main so gaya tha magar subah uthaa nahin
 When the companions went to awaken, Kanchan's body was stiff
 kanchan das das saal se paara shikshak tha, apane saathiyon ke liye chaaval lekar aayaa tha taaki dharna lanbaa chale
 After Kanchan's death, the mercury teachers took out a rally on a bike
 jharkhand ke dumka main yah raily nikaali gai thi
 Apart from Ujjwal and Kanchan, Bahadur Thakur and Jeetan Khatoon died
 ye sabhi 15 november ke lathi charge main ghayal hue the
 Was there any discussion about these mercury teachers, what happened in UP Bihar, these people have been teaching for ten years and fifteen years, want their jobs to be confirmed and get a good salary
 jharkhand main paara shikshakon kii badi samasya he
 He has struggled many times over salary and the conditions of his job
 das das saal se ye paara shikshak padhaa rahe hai
 Whether these questions are debated or not
 upi bihar kii chintaa karne vaale netaa inke liye bolte hai, nahin bolte hai, jo sarkaar main hote hai wo bilkul nahin bolte hai
 There is a system of providing government jobs in UP Bihar, they should be reviewed
 upi main naaraa laga bharti do yaa arathi do
 The slogans were among the 70,000 primary teachers of UP who gave the test
 iskaa video sitambar maheene main aayaa
 There was a scam in this restoration
 jise 122 number aayaa tha use fail kar diya
 And 20 such people were passed who failed
 ye main uttar pradesh kii hi baat kar rahaa hum
 Many people were given jobs who did not take the exam at all
 kya yah maamla itnaa gambhir nahin he ki inaki samiksha ho, kya upi bihar karne vaale netaa in samasyaon par dhyaan denge ki unke rajya ke sarkari imtihaanon main ghapala kaise ho jaataa he

 vaise raghuram rajan ne dow pranay roy se baatcheet karte hue kaha he ki naukariyon kii sthiti bhayaavah hoti ja rahi he
 job no
 na privet main na sarkari main
 In the case of government jobs, the governments are not able to give them the same amount
 naujavaanon ke saath yah anyaay upi main bhi ho rahaa he
 It is happening in Madhya Pradesh as well as in Karnataka
 isliye yah sawaal bhavukta kaa nahin he
 Now if you get carried away by sentimentality, then will anyone be able to promise to give 2 crore jobs every year? pichley ek maheene main dilli ke thok bazaaron main gehun 15 se 20 fisadi tak mahangaa hua he
 This is affecting the bread served in your plate
 aataa mahangaa ho rahaa he or aane vaale dinon main roti kaa niwala bhi mahangaa ho jayega
 Some expensive flour will come to your house this month because the mills from which it will come, they have to pay more for wheat
 khaadya mantralay ke taaja aankadon ke mutabik dilli ke thok bazaar main 8 oktober ko 1825 rupee quintal milane vaala gehun ab 8 november ko 2130 rupee quintal mil rahaa he
 That is, an increase of Rs 305 a quintal in a month
 jeje foods privet limited ke aria cells manager saf ahamed kehete hai, "gehun mahangaa hone kaa asar aataa kii keemton par padaa he
 Dough has become expensive
 " central dilli kii south avenue colony main kiraanaa dukaan maalik ashok khurana kehete hai
 
 
 In the last twenty days, flour has become expensive by 23 per cent
 20 din pehle ham 22 rupee kilo bech rahe the ab keemat badhkar 27 rupee ho gai he
 Five rupees kg increase
 gehun udyog se jude log maanate hai ki bazaar main gehun jitna chahie utana nahin he
 The government should interfere in this
 gehun ke kamishan agent laal ratna kehete hai, "bazaar main sarkaar ko gehun kaa open cell karnaa chahie
 According to the demand in the market, the supply of wheat has reduced considerably ”
 pichley ek maheene main dilli ke bazaaron main gehun 15 se 20 fisadi mahangaa hua he
 
 
 Due to this, the cost of flour mills has increased
 
 
 nateeja yah hua he ki iskaa asar ab saaf taur par thok or khudara bazaar par dikhne laga he
 Saif Ahmed, Area Sales Manager, JJ Foods Pvt Ltd, says, “the price of wheat has been impacted by the cost of wheat being expensive
 aataa mahangaa ho gaya he
 "says Ashok Khurana, the grocery store owner in South Avenue Colony in Central Delhi
 
 
 pichley bees din main aataa 23 fisadi tak mahangaa ho gaya he
 20 days ago we were selling Rs 22 a kg, now the price has increased to Rs 27
 paanch rupee kilo kii badhottaree
 Those associated with the wheat industry believe that there is not as much wheat as required in the market
 sarkaar ko isamen dakhal dena chahie
 Lal Ratna, the commission agent for wheat, says, “the government should open wheat in the market
 bazaar main demand ke mutabik supplai se gehun kii kaaphi kam ho gai he"
 In the last one month, wheat has become costlier by 15 to 20 percent in Delhi markets
 
 
 is vajah se aataa milon kii laagat badi he
 
 
 As a result, its impact is now clearly visible on the wholesale and retail markets

 Tea, which is made in every household, tea which millions of people start their day by drinking
 din main 3 se 4 cap chaay pi lenaa to aam baat hoti he
 But note, this tea is not threatening your life
 khaaskar agar aap daphtar main yaa ghar ke baahar se plastic cap main chaay mangate hai
 The question is whether there is cancer in your cup of tea
 kya plastic yaa paper cap main chaay pinaa maut ko nimantran he
 If you too are fond of tea, then watch this news
 yun to plastic ke nuksaan kii khabaren vakt vakt par aati rahati hai
 But nowadays such a message is going viral according to which if the tea was drunk in a plastic cup, then cancer is certain
 ye baat or koi nahin, sabsepratishthit aspataal amske hawaale se kahi ja rahi he
 According to this message, AIIMS has given reasons for cancer
 massej main kaha ja rahaa he ki jab plastic garmi ke sampark main aata he to aisa rasayan utapann karata he jo 32 prakaar kecansarka kaaran banataa he
 Thus, this message is better than 100 redundant messages
 apane mitron auki rishtedaaron ko suchit karen taaki wo aise prabhaav se dur rahen
 Since the plastic cups are used by the people in the street, there is a stir from this message
 'aaj tak' ne is massej kaa viral test karnaa shuru kiya
 First of all was to go to AIIMS hospital
 kyonki ames aspataal main cancer ilaaj kaa baqayda ek vibhaag he
 'aaj Tak' correspondent Abhishek Tiwari arrived at that department of the hospital and contacted the head of department doctor GK Rath
 unase jaanane kii koshish kii gai ki plastic or cancer kaa kya rishta he, kya koi garm chiz agar plastic kii cap main daali jaae to wo zahreeli ban sakati he? kya plastic ke bartan main khaanaa khaane se bhi cancer ho saktaa he?iske jawaab main ames ke doctoron ne bataaya ki ye research main abhi tak saamne nahin aayaa ki plastic ke bartan main khaanaa khaane or plastic cap main chaay pine se cancer ho saktaa he
 Although he said that using poor quality plastic continuously can lead to some other diseases, but the risk of disease like cancer is wrong
 yani ames ke doctoron ne viral khabar ko afvaah qaraar diya
 But the 'aaj Tak' investigation related to tea did not end here
 ab baari he us duusare massej kii jisamen paper cap main maut vaali lep kaa zikr he
 Because the message is claimed that the tea paper cup has a wax coating that melts with hot tea and goes into your body, it can cause cancer diabetes, heart diseases and kidney failure
 isliye 'aaj tak' kii team pahunchi dispozable paper cap banane vaali ek company main ye jaanane ke liye ki paper cap ke andar jo chamakdaar coating hoti he wo kya hoti he
 Asked Prateek Agarwal, the owner of Mayan Enterprises, whether the wax layer is really in these cups
 unhone bataaya ki ye food grad coating he, vaix nahin he
 When asked if the coating of the cup can melt with the temperature of the tea? Pratik said that the cups with wax coating stopped being made seven years ago
 hamane unase poocha ki kya ye plastic food coating garm chaay ke taapmaana main pigal sakati he or chaay ke saath sharir main ja sakati he
 He said that the melting point is 220 degrees and tea does not exceed 100 degrees
 aakhri sawaal tha ki kya paper cap main chaay pinaa surakshit he? ye jawaab cap banane waalon se jaananaa sahi nahin hota, lihaaza maiks aspataal ke doctor ankur bahal se baat kii gai or sawaal kiya ki kya log bina kisi dar ke dispozable paper cap main chaay pi sakate hai
 The doctor made it clear that it is safe to drink tea in a paper cup
 or cancer jaisi bimariyon kii baat galat he
 This news also failed in the viral test of Aaj Tak
 yani plastic ke cap main chaay pinaa bilkul surakshit he

 The tussle between NCP and Congress leaders seems to be intact even two years after the election
 ensipi netaa praphul patel ke ek bayaan par pratikriya dete hue maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri or congress netaa prithviraj chavaan ne kaha he ki praphul patel bolne se pehle apni soochna pukhta karen
 Recently, while addressing a rally in Akola, Vidarbha, Praful Patel made a sharp comment on the Congress
 unhone kaha tha ki, 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main kagress khud to haari hi, ensipi ko bhi haraa diya
 Taking this matter further, Patel alleged that Prithviraj Chavan tarnished the party's image by accusing NCP leaders of indulging in scams
 chavaan ne patel ke aaropon ko khaarij kiya he
 Responding to Patel's allegations a week later at his Mumbai office, Chavan said that the then Home Minister RR Patil had ordered the Anti Corruption Bureau inquiry against NCP leaders Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare in the irrigation scam
 or jaise kii purv grahamantri patil kaa swabhaav tha
 They would not have taken any decision instead of what the high command had said
 yahaan par bataa den ki, aar aar patil kaa nidhan ho chukaa he
 The comments chavaan ne yah bhi kaha ki aar aar patil ko aisi bhi kya jaldi thi ki unhone 20 sitambar 2014 ko maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan lagu hone se haftebhar pehle tezi dikhaakar apni hi party ke ajit pavaar or sunil tatakare in netaaon ke khilaaf jaanch ke aadesh die
 In such a situation, Praful Patel should confirm his information before accusing me of tarnishing the image of NCP
 jate jate chavaan ne yah bhi tanj kas diya ki ensipi netaa chagan bhujabal or ramesh kadam karodon rupee ke ghotaalon ke chalate jail main he
 Will i be held responsible for that too? haal hi main vidarbha ke akola main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue praphul patel ne congress par tikhi tippanee kii thi
 He had said that Congress had lost itself in the 2014 assembly elections, defeated NCP as well
 is baat ko or aage le jate hue patel ne aarope lagaaya ki, prithviraj chavaan ne ensipi netaaon par ghapale main lipt hone ke aarope lagaakar party kii chhavi karaab kii
 Chavan has dismissed Patel's allegations
 patel ke aaropon kaa haftebhar baad mumbai ke apane karyaalay par jawaab dete hue chavaan bole ki, sinchai ghotaale main ensipi netaa ajit pavaar or sunil tatakare ke khilaaf anti karpshan beuro se jaanch karaane aadesh to tatkaaleen grahamantri aar aar patil ne diya tha, unhone nahin
 And as was the nature of the former Home Minister Patil
 unhone koi bhi faisla alaakaman ke kehane ke bajaay kiya nahin hoga
 Please tell here that, RR Patil has passed away
 tippaniyan Chavan also said that RR Patil was also in such a hurry that he gave orders for investigation against these leaders Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare of his own party on 20 September 2014, a week before the imposition of President's rule in Maharashtra
 aise main ensipi kii chhavi karaab karne kaa aarope mujhapar lagane se pehle praphul patel apni jaankaree pukhta kar len
 On the go, Chavan also stressed that NCP leaders Chhagan Bhujbal and Ramesh Kadam are in jail due to scams of crores of rupees
 kya us ke liye bhi ab mujhe hi jimmedaar tehraaya jayega? Responding to Patel's allegations a week later at his Mumbai office, Chavan said that the then Home Minister RR Patil had ordered the Anti Corruption Bureau inquiry against NCP leaders Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare in the irrigation scam
 or jaise kii purv grahamantri patil kaa swabhaav tha

 bhartiya iphone yugers kii sabase badi dikkat shaayad yah hoti he ki isamen dual sim kaa opshan nahin hota
 Recently, when Reliance Jio stepped in freeing its services in the country, the iphone users were very upset because they wanted to take Jio and also change their primary number
 lekin ab ek patent se yah saamne aayaa he ki aipal alge saal iphone main dual sim kaa opshan de sakati he
 According to the report, Apple has been granted dual SIM technology patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office
 ek report forbs ke hawaale se he jisamen ek dastavej kaa zikr he jise china state intelexual property ke antargat file kiya gaya he jisamen dual sim feechar darj he
 In the information given, it has been written about the dual system patent from its mechanism
 iske alaava yahaan dual sim ke kaam karne or controling ke tareekon ke bare main bhi likhaa he
 For example, if calling from an ECO SIM, mobile data can be played from another SIM
 haalanki yah pehali dfa nahin he jab iphone mendual sim kii baat kii ja rahi he
 Because if you remember, even before the iphone 7 launch, it was rumored that the company could offer dual sim in it
 gauratlab he ki asian deshon main khaskar bharat or china main in dinon dual sim kii maang lagaataar bad rahi he
 According to a researcher at couturepoint, about 90 percent of Indian smartphone users use dual SIM smartphones
 demand ko dekhte hue is report par vishwaas kiya ja sakat he
 But it is possible that Apple will launch a special variant which has dual sim support
 yaa isse bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki agle yphone main hibrid sim saport diya ja saktaa he
 That is, you can insert a SIM in one slot and a memory card in another
 haalanki memory card or yphone ye apane aap main ek antarvirodh vaali baat he, lekin kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa
 Anyway, in many cases this time the iphone 7 is backward

 The first budget of 0 is going to present Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today
 har saal kii tarah is baar bhi bajet se kaaphi ummiden hai
 India has 412 among the top 5 economies in the world
 9 billian dollar kaa videshi mudra bhandar he, lekin desh kii sthiti abhi bhi loar-middle inakam desh kii he
 Whereas the neighboring country Sri Lanka has moved from the group of lower-middle income countries to the group of upper-middle income countries just 3 days before the budget is presented
 bharat jansankhya ke lihaaj se doosraa, arthvyavastha ke lihaaj se paanchvaan or kshetrafal ke lihaaj se saatvaan sabase bada desh he, lekin aay ke maamle main uski ginati duniya ke sampann deshon se kya kai padosi mulkon ke saath bhi nahin hoti he
 The group of lower-middle income countries that India is in includes 47 small countries including Senegal, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh
 world bank kii ore se 1 july ko aay par aadhaarit deshon kii suchi jari kii gai jisamen 10 saalon se bharat loar-middle inakam desh bana hua he, haalanki pichley saal kii tulana main is saal desh kii aay badi he, lekin itnaa nahin ki use apper-middle inakam deshon main shaamil kiya ja sake
 The 80-nation group in the high-income group compiled the list under the Atlas method, based on which the global institution calculated Gross National Income (GNI) on a per capita income (US dollar) basis
 world bank ne 4 inakam group bana rakhe hai or deshon kii aay ke aadhaar par alag-alag group main rakhaa jaataa he
 This report has been prepared based on 2018 data
 lo-inakam group (1,025 dollar yaa isse kam yani 70,069 rupye yaa isse kam), loar-middle inakam group (1,026 se 3,995 dollar yaa 70,137 se lekar 2,73,098 rupye), apper-middle inakam group (3,996 se 12,375 dollar yaa 2,73,167 se lekar 8,45,955 rupye) or hai-inakam group (12,376 se isse zyada yaa 8,46,023 rupye se lekar aage) main duniya ke 218 arthvyastha vaale deshon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 80 countries in the world have been placed in the high-income group, while 60 have been placed in the upper middle group and 47 in the lower middle class and 31 countries have been placed in the low-income group
 yah inakam aadhaarit deshon kaa vargeekaran har saal july ke pehle hafte main kiya jaataa he
 Narendra Modi 2 to India behind our neighbors
 0 ke pehle bajet se ummid hogi ki bajet se desh kii arthvyavastha sudhare or agle saal july main jab nai list aae to wo khud ko apper-middle inakam group main shaamil paae
 India is the largest country in South Asia, but its economic status is far less than the neighboring countries
 maldive, srilanka or bhutan kii prati vyakti jienai bharat se zyada he
 India stands with Bangladesh and Pakistan (nominal picture) Not South India from South Asia but small countries like Maldives and Sri Lanka are included in the upper-middle Income Group
 srilanka is baar pehali baar is group main shaamil hua he
 Maldives ($ 9,310 or Rs
 6,36,432) is already in this group, while Sri Lanka ($ 4,060 or Rs
 2,77,542) has become the second richest country on a GNI per capita basis
 bangladesh-pakistan ke saath bharatloar-middle inakam group main bharat ke alaava bangladesh (1,750 dollar yaa 1,19,630 rupye) or pakistan (1,580 dollar yaa 1,08,009 rupye) hai, jabaki nepal (960 dollar yaa 65,626 rupye) or afghanistan (550 dollar yaa 37,598 rupye) lo-inakam group main shaamil hai
 Sri Lankan Sri Lankan overtakes India is one of the 7 countries (argentina, Kosovo, Sri Lanka, Georgia, Senegal, Zimbabwe and Comoros) whose categories have changed this time
 srilanka 2 dashak tak loar-middle inakam group main rahane ke baad ab vahaan se nikalakar apper-middle inakam group main shaamil ho gaya he
 Sri Lanka left the low-income group in 1999 to join the lower-middle income group
 20 saal baad usne khud ko apgrade kar liya he
 The biggest loss has been to Argentina which was in the high-income group till 2017, but this time it came in the upper-middle income
 pichley saal argentina kaa inakam prati vyakti 13,040 america dollar tha jo is saal ghatakar 12,370 dollar ho gaya jis kaaran uski sthiti kharaab ho gai
 Apart from Sri Lanka, Kosovo has also been included in the list of upper-middle income countries
 BRICS deshon se bhi pichhebharatabharat padosi deshon se hi nahin balki bricks deshon se bhi kahin peeche hai
 Among the BRICS countries, India is the only country which is a lower-middle income country while the remaining 4 countries are upper-income countries
 dakshin africa (5,720 dollar yaa 3,91,019 rupye), brazil (9,140 dollar yaa 6,24,810 rupye), china (9,470 dollar yaa 6,47,369 rupye) or rus (5,720 dollar yaa 3,91,019 rupye) bharat se kahin aage hai
 India may be on the path of development, but to become a strong economy, it has to go a long way
 world bank kii yah report niraash karti he ki 2009 main lo-inakam se upar aate hue bharat loar-middle inakam deshon main shumaar ho gaya, lekin ab use apper-middle deshon (prati vyakti jienai 3,996 dollar se zyada) kii suchi main aane ke liye vartmaan (bharat kii prati vyakti jienai 2,020 dollar) se dabl kii inakam karnaa hogi jo aasaan nahin dikhataa, lekin us abhiyaan kii shuruyaat to kar saktaa he jo modi raaj main loar se apper inakam group main shaamil kara sake

 At the same time, elections to 16 states and Puducherry can be held by the end of 2021

 gauratlab he ki centre keemodi sarkardesh main ek saath chunaav karaane ke vichaar kaa samarthan kar rahi he
 The reasoning behind this is that this will reduce the extra burden of election expenses on the citizens of the country and will save the use of resources to conduct elections repeatedly
 ab vidhi ayog ne sarkaar ke samaksh ek desh, ek chunaav par vibhinn siforeeshon ke saath report saunpi he
 However, the government is not bound to follow these recommendations
 isse pehlechunaav ayogchunaav ayog ek saath chunaav karaane ko lekar apni raay spasht kar chukaa he
 The Election Commission believes that this is not possible in the current constitutional provisions, so the government should first focus on constitutional provisions

 desh main GST lagu hone ke baad yah topic film industry main bhi chaaya hua he
 After the Tamil film 'mursal', the film has now been released under the name GST
 is movie ke saath ek baar phir jiesti vivaad khadey hone kii sambhaavna he
 The full name of the GST movie is erroneously yours only
 haalanki film main jiesti ko lekar koi zikr nahin kiya gaya he, yah mahaj ek romantic drama story he

 Whereas in India there is 12 percent GST on medicines and there is no GST on alcohol

 According to the Superintendent of Lone Hospital, this experiment has been used for the first time in Rajasthan to listen to the voice of parents with music therapy to such a young child
 ilaaj kar rahe doctoron ke liye yah cese pechida tha or jisamen davaaiyaan kaam nahin kar rahi thim, isliye yah prayog kiya gaya jo kaam kar gaya

 com / w7hbdc4bmw The Royal Challengers Bangalore team, which played the final of the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), will take on the Pune Warriors team led by Yuvraj Singh at their home ground Chinnaswamy Stadium on Friday
 apane pichley match main dilli daire davills par firozshah kotla stadium main romaanchak jeet darj karne vaali danniel vittori kii team ke paas lagaataar teesri jeet ke saath 10 tiimon kii talika main apni sthiti majboot karne kaa acha mauka he
 Vettori's team, who have played seven matches so far, made a great start to IPL-4 by defeating the Kochi Tuskers but after that they lost in three consecutive matches to Mumbai Indians, Deccan Chargers and Chennai Super Kings
 is bich rajasthan ke saath khelaa gaya uskaa ek ahm match barish main dhul gaya, jis kaaran use ek ank se santosh karnaa padaa
 After this, Vettori's team made a brilliant comeback and did justice to their reputation and won against Delhi and Kolkata Knight Riders
 duusari ore, lagaataar do jeet ke saath ipel main shandaar aagaaj karne vaali yuvaraj kii team ab tak khele gaye chah maichon main se chaar haar chuki he
 He has two wins in his account which he got against Kings XI Punjab and Kochi but after this the team has lost twice to Super Kings and once to Mumbai Indians and Daredevils
 daire davills ko haraane ke baad ek taraf jahaan chalangers agali chunauti ke liye qamar kas chuke hai vahiin duusari ore, yuvaraj ko lagaataar chaar haar ke baad apane saathiyon kaa manobal banaae rakhane main kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa hoga
 In this sense, the Challengers have a great chance to knock down the demoralized Warriors
 gujarat ke chunaav nateezon ko lekar na jane kitni baaten kahin jaaengi
 But the strategic analysis of the results will still be relevant as elections are to be held in four big states next year with just eighteen months left in the Lok Sabha elections
 is nigaah se dekhen to gujarat ke gramin ilaakon main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ko jhatka khaanaa padaa he or usamen bhi saurashtra kshetra uske liye duswapn sareekha hi rahaa
 For example, in the rural areas of northern Gujarat where huge crowds gathered during Modi's rallies in 2012, the party did not do well
 gujarat main kareeb do saal pehle disambar main hue jila panchayat chunaav main congress ne 31 main se 23 siton par bhaajapa ko shikast di
 In the taluk elections too, the Congress had got a lot of seats compared to the BJP
 in donon chunaav ke nateezon ko 2017 ke nateezon ke mila den to gramin gujarat main bhaajapa kii khisak chuki jameen kaa masalaa sach sabit hota he
 The villages of Gujarat became a challenge for the BJP and for the Congress to come back to Gujarat, rather, it came as a chance to set foot, and the Congress was successful to that extent
 haalanki bhaajapa ne puri koshish kii thi ki gramin ilaake main uskaa vot bank nahin toote, yadi kisi vajah se inhen tuutane se nahin bachaaya ja sake to kam se kam votaron ko congress kii taraf ekajute hone se to roka hi jaae
 The bjp's strategy was stating that the party was in a defensive position
 aakhir, jiesti, ganna or moongfalee ke mulyon ko aakhir palon main samarthan dena aisa hi kadam tha
 Just look at the area: There are a total of 54 assembly seats in Saurashtra region
 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ne yahaan 35 siten hasil kii thim, lekin is baar use 23 siton se santosh karnaa padaa
 Saurashtra was the only region in the entire state where the difference in seat share between BJP and Congress went from positive to negative
 to is badlaav kaa kya arth he? kya sirf bhugolic vibhaajan yaa iske koi aarthik sanket bhi hai?nishchay hi, aarthik kaarak adhik majboot kaaran bane
 It is now known to everyone that the bjp's base in the villages of Gujarat is getting hurt
 agar kshetravaar baat karen to har kshetra ke gramin ilaakon main matadaata bhaajapa se naaraaz dikhaa he
 Nearly 90 percent of the seats in North Gujarat are from rural areas, while in South Gujarat only 50 percent
 saurashtra main 75 fisadi or madhya gujarat main gramin siton kii sankhya 63 fisadi he
 As expected, the Congress took the lead in terms of number of seats on BJP in North Gujarat and Saurashtra region
 in donon ilaakon main congress ko kramshah 53
 1 and 55
 56 fisadi siten hasil huin
 The reasons for the region-wise differences in the performance of the two parties are hidden in the nature of seats
 kuch nahin, ek aasaan sa aankada sthiti spasht kar detaa he
 At the state level, there is a gap of about 12% in seat sharing between the two parties
 lekin isi aankade ko ilakaur dekhen to isamen kaaphi utaar-chadhaav bhi he
 Analyzing urban and rural seats separately, this difference significantly reduces
 kshetravaar siton kaa antar gramin ilaakon main kam or shahari ilaakon main adhik he
 This meant that dissatisfaction against the BJP was more vocal in rural Gujarat
 2012 main aisa nahin tha
 Even in rural areas, bjp's performance was better than Congress's performance in Saurashtra
 tab use saurashtra kii 40 gramin siton main se 24 or dakshin gujarat main 15 main se 9 siten hasil hui thim
 So what has changed this time? Saurashtra region of Gujarat is a cotton growing region
 2012 ke baad se kapaas kii keemten ounde munh giri hai
 Perhaps the farmers of South Gujarat have not faced the same difficulties as the farmers of Saurashtra because there, sugarcane, not cotton, is the main crop
 ganne ke fasal kii keemat moongfalee yaa kapaas kii tarah dhadaam nahin hui thi
 In such a situation, the competition in the rural areas between the Congress and the BJP in South Gujarat has come down on par
 khayr, gujarat main to hathi bhi nikal gaya or uski poonch bhi, lekin bhaajapa ke saamne badi chunauti hogi rajasthan or madhya pradesh main apni satta bachaae rakhana
 After all, if the BJP failed to retain its shifting mass base of villages, then in 2019, it will prove to be crooked in its own majority

 'the number of members supporting Ramachandran in the council has been very low and if sources are to be believed, he may be removed from the post before or during the AGM to be held on 14 December

 Today is Children's Day

 20 november ko manaaya jaataa tha bal divasasaal 1925 se bal diwas manaaya jane laga or 1953 main duniya bhar main ise manyata mili
 The United Nations announced the celebration of November 20 as Children's Day, but it is celebrated on different days in other countries
 bharat main bhi pehle yah 20 november ko hi manaaya jaataa tha, lekin 1964 main pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ke nidhan ke baad sarvasahmati se ye faisla liya gaya ki jawaharlal nehru ke janmdin ko bal diwas ke taur par mana jaae
 In this way, India got a Children's Day apart from the world

 isse sarkaar ko koi khatara nahin he
 But what is the arithmetic of government, let's know
 
 
 - congress ke paas 205 saansad - 18 mps of DMK - ensipi ke 9 saansad - 5 mps of National Lok Dal - neshnal conference ke 3 saansad - Other 21 mps yani kul 261 saansad hote hai Apart from this, parties that support the government from outside - sapa ke 22 saansad - 21 mps of BSP or - 3 mps of JDS yani kul 46 sadsy Combining these, a total of 261 + 46 means 307 mps in support of the UPA
 philhal tiemasi ke 19 saansadon ke hatane ke baavjood sarkaar kii sehat par koi asar padataa nahin dikh rahaa
 But, if the SP also separates with its 22 mps, the government will have 307–22, ie 285 mps
 yani sarkaar kii nirbharta mayawati par kaaphi bad jaaegi
 The comments lekin, agar bispi saath he or diemke apane 18 saansadon kaa samarthan upie se waapas le letaa he to 285 main se 18 ghataane par sarkaar ko 267 saansadon kaa hi samarthan rah jayega or sarkaar alpamat main aa jaaegi

 At present, despite the withdrawal of 19 mps of TMC, there is no effect on the health of the government
 lekin, agar sapa bhi apane 22 saansadon ke saath alag ho jaae to sarkaar ke haq main 307−22 yani 285 saansad rahenge
 That is, the dependence of the government on Mayawati will increase considerably
 tippaniyan But, if the BSP is together and the DMK withdraws the support of 18 of its mps from the UPA, then reducing the 18 out of 285, the government will have the support of 267 mps and the government will be reduced to a minority

 Considering the political situation, it seems that Delhi may have to wait a long time for the new government
 sutron ke mutabik, dilli main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke asaar bahut zyada bad gaye hai
 Sources in the Lieutenant Governor have informed Mail Today that LG Najib Jung has sent his report on the political situation in Delhi to President Pranab Mukherjee
 is report main uparajyapal ne kaha he ki dilli main koi bhi party sarkaar banane kii sthiti main nahin he
 According to sources, the report recommends imposition of President's rule in Delhi
 agar halaat main bahut zyada ulatpher na hua, to dilli main raashtrapati shashan lag saktaa he
 In such a situation, the Lieutenant Governor can charge Najib Jung
 tab dilli ko nai sarkaar ke liye agle loksabhaa chunaav tak intjaar karnaa padegaa, kyonki samajha ja rahaa he ki dilli ke chunaav bhi loksabhaa chunaav ke saath hi karaae jaaenge
 In fact, the exercise to form a government in Delhi went two steps further when the Aam Aadmi Party added another condition to form the government
 AAP ne sarkaar banane ke liye bijepi or congress se har mudde par likhit samarthan dene kii baat kahi
 It says that both parties should give written assurance to agree to 18 conditions, only then will they think about forming the government

 kejariwal ne isamen likhaa he ki wo satta main aae, to dilli main congress ke pandrah saal main hue ghotaalon kii jaanch karaayenge or emsidi main bijepi ke shashan ke dauraan hue ghotaalon kii jaanch karenge
 The accounts of power companies will be checked
 padhein: kejariwal ne chitthee main sonia gandhi ke saamne rakhi hai ye sharten
 
 
 Earlier, Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal asked Lt Governor Najeeb Jung for ten days to form the government in Delhi
 lekin uparajyapal ne tab samay-seemaa tay nahin kii
 The Lieutenant Governor said that when the Aam Aadmi Party has enough mlas to prove its majority, they should come forward and claim the government
 rajyapal se mulaakaat ke dauraan kejariwal ne kaha ki wo sarkaar banane par janata kii raay jaananaa chaahate hai
 After this, the way the Congress press conference took place, after which the political arrogance became more rapid

 For the last two decades, new colleges in small towns and cities have been challenging the supremacy of big cities and well-known universities
 india today-nilsan ke 2014 ke best collejon kaa surveykshan bataata he ki hamaari shiksha niti ‘‘vishisht’’ ucch sansthaanon par hi kendrit nahin rah sakati
 The survey for the new government of India gives an indication of the future of higher education in the country
 kuch kaa varchasv kaayam he-udhaaharan ke taur par dilli main science, arts or commers main best college hai
 This year the national rankings include 15 new colleges from second and third tier cities like Jaipur, Lucknow, Kochi and Chandigarh
 surveykshan main coimbatore, patna, bhubaneshwar or indore jaise chaar nae shaharon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 There is a healthy competition in the new colleges that are open in these cities as they are ahead in promoting and implementing new ideas
 pichley 20 saal main khule jin ubharate collejon ko surveykshan main shaamil kiya gaya, to paaya gaya ki top ke sthaan par anya collejon kaa kabja he
 The success of the new government in the field of education depends on how eager it is to adopt this new trend and how successful it is in breaking the false concepts of getting a good college education

" narendra modi ke netritv vaali sarkaar se milane vaale shuruaati sanket to bahut sambhaavna bhare najar nahin aate
 In his election speeches, he promised to open new iits and AIIMS in every state, which reflects his fascination with "specialized" higher education and institutions

 While the focus of the central government is only on specialized higher education, the focus on small colleges is so limited that the number of people enrolled in higher education in the country is increasing
 govinda kii chetavanee he ki sarkaar ko aisa nahin karnaa chahie
 "increasing the numbers means that the data can be compared to students enrolled in higher education in developed countries," he says
 jabaki sarkaar kaa dhyaan is baat par hona chahie ki chaatr collejon main kya sikhte hai or college shiksha puri karne ke baad naukari ke liye unki taiyaari kitni he

 For example, by bringing trained workers into the construction industry and giving them jobs on contract, labor regulations will have to be reoriented
 isi tarah agar skill deveopment ko vishisht kendron se pare collejon tak le janaa he to hair secondary str or collejon main padhai jane vaali vokational shiksha main behatar saamanjasy sthapit karnaa hoga
 Such arrangements will have to be made so that students can move freely from job to education and education to job

 Despite this, there have been good agreements recently with some top universities

 New colleges are also focusing on producing "job creators" (job creators) rather than "jobseekers"

 iske liye vidheyak kii jarurat nahin he jo kaary ko lataka de
 Similarly for foreign universities, we will have to talk to them directly, otherwise they will not be much interested in setting up campuses here
 ’’ sarkaar or vishvavidhyalay main khulaa samvaad sarkaar ke skill deveopment kaaryakramon ke kriyanvayan ke liye bhi jaruri he
 Improvement in the higher education system of the country should be included in the priority of the BJP government

 The government has also expressed willingness to accept new ideas and improve

 kisi company ke liye isse bade shame kii baat kya ho sakati he jab use yah bhi pataa na ho ki uske smartphone ke fatne ke peeche kii vajah kya he
 Samsung's best smartphone Galaxy Note 7 has now been discontinued due to burst problems
 iske fatne ke baad company ne logon ko nayaa smartphone diya, lekin wo bhi fat gaya
 The New York Times claims that South Korean technology giants don't even know why the Galaxy Note 7 is exploding
 is ghatana kii shuruyaat hue ek maheene se bhi zyada ho gaye hai or abhi tak samsung ke ejiniers yah pataa karne main fail rahe hai ki dikkat kya he
 According to reports, the company had given the task of investigation to about 100 engineers after reducing the continuous burning of Galaxy Note 7
 company se hui ye badi chookjab Galaxy Note 7 fatne kii pehali ghatana saamne ai to samsung ne ise bydaree kii samasya bataaya, or kaha ki yah kuch smartfones kii bydaree ke saath hi he
 The company declared the recall as a minor problem
 mid sitambar main company ne logon ko Galaxy Note 7 ke badale nae units dene shuru kar die
 In this, the company used the battery of another supplier
 lekin isse bhi koi phayda nahin hua aurriplacement units bhi fatneshuru ho gaye
 If the company had not considered it as a small problem, it would have not done so
 baharhaal, abhi bhi es lag rahaa he ki samsung ko koi thos kaaran kaa pataa nahin chalaa he jisase smartphone fatne kii samasya aa rahi he
 Park Shuv Won, former director of the Center for Advance Batteries at the Korea Electronics Institute, told the New York Times, 'we have reviewed the documents of the Corian Regulatory Authority and spoken to the engineers at SAMANG'
 It was too early to blame
 mujhe lagata he ki unamem koi dikkat nahin thi or shaayad phone fatne ke peeche bydaree mukhya kaaran bhi nahin thi
 He has also said that the Note 7 had a lot of features and was more complex than other smartphones, citing the vulnerability of the Galaxy Note 7

 RJD tweeted that Modi ji takes the name of Pakistan 200 times! RJD, in a tweet from his Twitter handle, suggested to do his work and talk about the country
 party (RJD) apane aadhikarik twitor handle par likhaa ki modi ji din main 200 baar pakistan kaa naam lete hai! are modi ji (PM Modi), pakistan se itnaa pyaar? bharat kaa naam lijie? aap bharat ke pradhanmantri hai! yah bharat kaa aam chunaav he! pakistan ke bharose hi chunaav ladenge? piddi se padosi par hi desh sari takat barbaad karen? apni, apane kaam kii, desh kii baat karo! bataa den ki piem modi (PM Modi) ko lekar argedy kaa yah koi pehla twit nahin he
 Even before this, the party had written on its Twitter account, targeting the PM, that yesterday Modi (PM Modi) said that "the playground will be Pakistan!" 44 jawans suddenly turned into rags with a bang and they think they are game? Whose game? His disgusting politics game? Whose players are they? Hey Modi ji, was a dying martyr! Were humans Left the family behind? Did you freak? Modiji takes the name of Pakistan 200 times a day! are modi ji, pakistan se itnaa pyaar? Name India aap bharat ke pradhanmantri hai! This is the general election of India! pakistan ke bharose hi chunaav ladoge? Should the country waste all its power on the neighbor with stubbornness? apni, apane kaam kii, desh kii baat karo!vahiin party ke varisht netaa tejasvi yadav ne bhi endie or piem modi ko lekar hamalavar rukh apanaaya hua he
 Tejashwi Yadav has accused PM Modi as well as Bihar CM Nitish Kumar of deceiving the general public
 kal modi ne kaha ki "khel kaa maidan pakistan hoga!" 44 jawans suddenly turned into rags with a bang and they think they are game? kiskaa khel? inaki ghinauni raajnneeti kaa khel? jiske ye khilaadi hai?

 Tejashwi had asked that what did Bihar gain from the government of Palitimar double engine made in Bihar due to the mandate theft? Apart from maladministration and unemployment, what was the share of the state? Why is the BJP shy of talking about the 2014 National Manifesto and the promises made in the 2015 Assembly elections in Bihar?

 agra main 5 oktober ko hone vaale samaajawaadee party ke rashtriya adhiveshan main sabaki nigahen is baat par hongi ki kyamulaayam singhisamen shirkat karke akhilesh yadav ko aashirwad denge yaa nahin
 If this happens, then it can be assumed that the antagonism within the Mulayam family in the Samajwadi Party has stopped and hope of reconciliation will arise
 haalanki, ye baat ab lagbhag tay he ki akhilesh yadav,samaajawaadee partike adhyaksh kaa pad mulaayam singh ko nahin lautaane ja rahe hai
 Rather, he will get his election approved as the President at the national convention

 After being defeated badly by the BSP in 2007, the Samajwadi Party once again came to Agra

 In this session, Mulayam put forward Akhilesh Yadav as the young face of the party and Akhilesh Yadav became the Chief Minister after the next assembly election

 This is the annual program of the association
 gurudakshina kaarykram main shirkat karne vaale sangh ke liye gupt daan karte hai
 The tradition of giving Guru Dakshina on the Guru Purnima festival in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has been going on since 1928
 27 sitambar 1925 ko sangh kii sthapana ke baad 1928 main pehali baar guru dakshina kaarykram hua

 The newly elected Congress government of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan may have announced loan waiver for the farmers, but according to one report, there is little scope for this in the fiscal condition of the three states
 care retings kii is report main kaha gaya he ki madhyapradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main kisaanon kii karj maafee kaa kul aakaar lagbhag 62,000 karod rupee tak hoga jabaki teenon rajyon ke rajkoshiya halaat ko dekhte huye itani gunjaaish nahin he
 The agency says that as per the fiscal position of Madhya Pradesh, it has only Rs 3,120 crore, Rajasthan has Rs 3,095 crore and Chhattisgarh has only Rs 1,195 crore
 care retings ke mukhya arthshaastri madan sabanvis ne kaha ki rajkoshiya uttardaayitv evam bajet prabandhan adhinium kii baadhyataaon ke chalate teenon hi rajya ise vitt varsh 2019-20 main hi lagu kar paaenge

 He will have to spend Rs 14,000 crore on it but he too will be able to settle it in two years
 loksabhaa chunaav (lok Sabha Elction 2019) kii ranbheri baj chuki he or jaise-jaise chunaav ke din najadik aa rahe hai, partiyon ke bich muqabla or bhi dilachasp hote ja rahaa he
 On the one hand, while the BJP is inducting celebrity-stars into its party, the Congress is also not far behind and it is also inducting celebrity-stars into its party
 loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle mashhoor hariyaanvi dancer sapana choudhary (sapna Choudhary) ne congress kaa haath tham liya he
 Sapna Chaudhary has joined the Congress and she can be fielded in this electoral arena to show strength
 khaas baat he ki sapana choudhary ke jis seat se chunaav ladane kii baat chal rahi he, vah seat kaaphi mashhoor actress ke kabje main he
 That is, according to the news, Sapna Chaudhary can be contested from Mathura seat of Uttar Pradesh, which is occupied by the first c BJP leader and actress Hema Malini
 haalanki, shanivaar kii der raat congress nipani aathvin suchi jari kii he, jiske mutabik usne mathura se mahesh pathak ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he
 Congress has announced the name of Mahesh Pathak from Mathura seat and has tried to put a stop to the speculation of Sapna Chaudhary to contest from Mathura
 darasal, shanivaar kii der shaam sapana choudhary congress main shaamil huin
 Soon after, he met Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, whose pictures also went viral on social media
 congress ke sutron kaa maananaa he ki mathura seat par congress kii najar he or hema malini kii prasiddhi ko takkar dene ke liye sapana choudhary kaa naam makul he
 This is the reason that Congress can field Sapna Choudhary News from Mathura seat against Hema Malini
 bataa den ki hema malini ko bijepi ne lagaataar duusari baar mathura se maidan main utarahe
 Despite the seal of the candidate from the Congress on the Mathura seat, the phase of speculation continues in the name of Sapna Chaudhary
 mathura se sapana choudhary ke chunaav ladane kii khabaron par isliye bhi viraam nahin lag rahaa kyonki isse pehle bhi congress apane ummidavaaron ke naam main badlaav kar chuki he
 Earlier there was talk of Raj Babbar contesting from Moradabad, but later the Congress made Imran Pratapgarhi its candidate
 isliye abhi mathura seat par bhi congress apni ranjaiti badalati he to is par koi aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 The Congress Central Election Committee announces the eighth list of candidates for the ensuing elections to the Lok Sabha pic
 twitter
 com / ywrx1kmu5s The Congress is also believed to be willing to bet on Sapna as Sapna Chaudhary can prove to be effective in beating Hema Malini's popularity
 isamen koi doraay nahin ki mathura se hema malini agar saansad bani hai to iske peeche unki lokapriyata hi he
 Apart from this, this will be the second term of Hema Malini, so Sapna Choudhary can also take advantage of her popularity and she can also win this seat for Congress
 bataa den ki sapana choudhary ne apane dance ke kaaran soshal media par lagaataar dhooma machaai hui hai
 In the Lok Sabha elections 2014, Hema Malini got more than 50 percent of the votes in Mathura seat
 hema ne ajit choudhary ke bete jayant ko bade antar se haraaya tha
 Mathura Lok Sabha has a total of 5 Lok Sabha seats
 inamen chaataa, maant, govardhan, mathura or baldev kii vidhansabha seat shaamil hai
 This seat of western Uttar Pradesh has been dominated by Jat and Muslim voters
 2014 main bhi jat or muslim votaron ke alag hone kaa nuksaan hi ralod ko bhugatna padaa tha
 The Jats voted outright in favor of the BJP
 2014 ke aankadon ke anusaar mathura loksabhaa kshetra main kul 17 lakh matadaata hai, inamen 9
 There are 3 lakh male and 7 lakh female voters
 haalanki, hema malini pehle rajyasabha saansad bhi rah chuki hai
 Some consider the Modi wave to be a big factor behind his victory in the last election
 saath hi saath unki lokapriyata bhi unki jeet main ahm rahi he
 But on the scale of popularity, Sapna Chaudhary has gone a long way when it comes to philanthropy
 pashchimi uttar pradesh main to sapana choudhary kii dhooma he
 So, if the contest here is Sapna Chaudhary vs Hema Malini, then the whole game depends on popularity

 Why is there a discussion about 'masculinity' in the worldwide movement called metoo ( # metoo ie i too)? Does it mean that masculinity, as it is defined, stands against this movement? After the # metoo campaign started in October after dozens of allegations of rape and sexual violence against Hollywood's influential producer Harvey Weinstein
 Had happened, or rather it was raised again, its purpose was to motivate women to break their silence and those incidents Share what has happened to her as well and on the pretext she will find a comfort and collective with women who share similar experiences around the world
 uskaa aashay mard yaa mardaangi se nahin tha
 But this was an upside
 yakeenan # metoo abhiyaan kaa ek hissaa purushon ke bare main he or darasal shuruyaat se hi tha
 On a large scale, men are responsible for sexual violence, and their victims are women, children, and some men
 isliye yah baat ajeeb lagati he ki # metoo ko lekar chal rahe saare samvaad se purush is kadar gaayab rahen
 Given the prevalence of sexual violence and what such violence reveals about men, it is understandable that most men have remained silent and not dare to respond to the indictment on their sexuality They are not able to muster nor are they ready to change themselves
 kuchhek purushon ne shaayad apni sanak main 'sabhipurushanheen' ( # notallmen) sareekhe abhiyaan kii aad lene kii koshish kii he lekin ve yah bhul gaye ki # metoo sabhi purushon or sabhi mahilaon ke bare main he
 There should be no hashtag needed to tell men that we are collectively guilty of inhuman treatment of women
 # metoo abhiyaan ko lekar jo haal main aalochanaayen kii gai hai unamem ek yah he ki usamen abhadra vyavhaar ko bhi yon hamale or balaatkaar kii shrenee main rakh diya gaya he or yon foohadataa kii vyakhya yon aakraamakata ke taur par kii gai he
 But if we have to change the culture, then we must first stop these attacks, especially this constant threat of male sexual entitlement and the way it demeans women
 # metoo abhiyaan ke tahat saamne aa rahi kai kahaniyaan yon hinsa kii bajaae nasamajhiyon kii bhi hai, lekin in bhrantiyon or galat vyakhyaaon se hi jo bahes ubhartee he vah logon kii maansikta ko saamne laati he, un dharanaon ko baahar nikaalati he jo log maanakar chal lete hai or is tarah kii dharanaon kii saanskrithik or langik buniyaaden bhi benakaab ho jaati hai
 In such a situation, under the guise of interpretations such as # notallmen, there is basically nothing in men that needs to be changed, and there is no need for all of us men to answer such uncomfortable questions
 # metoo ko lekar ek or jis tareeke se purushon ne apana rukh jaahir kiya he, vah bhi kapatpurna he
 In this, they are apparently expressing support for the movement and its cause, but in their personal lives they are as aggressive and exploitative as the men they are criticizing
 ye us birdari ke log hai jo khud ko 'jaagruk' jaahir karte hai ( # metoo andolan ke shabd or bhashaa sab america se hamen mil rahe hai), ve soshal media par shandaar post likhte hai yaa video banaate hai, jab tak ki koi mahila parade ke peeche se saamne aakar yah jaahir na kar de ki in shandaar post kii aad main darasal panne dar panne foohad text massej, chaalaaki bhari jabardastee, or prashansa yaa haisiyat kaa sex ke liye istemaal karne kii pravriti chhipi he
 For example, a few weeks ago, Shamir Ruben, a young poet, was being praised for his feminist, emotionally honest poems, while many fellow poets accused him of exploiting them when they were all young
 ve unhen younottejak massej bhejte the, unase nagn tasveeron kii maang karte the or unhen sex ke liye 'taiyaar' karne kii koshish karte the
 His 'apology' on these accusations appears to stem from the contemporary mold of fraud — repenting, promising to 'learn', but refusing to be informed that his behavior was wrong or harmed anyone
 Can
 ab samay aa gaya he ki purushon ko puri gambhirtha se # metoo andolan ke saath khud ko jodpha chahie
 They should not show off their actions like whipping themselves or 'accepting' their mistakes, but testing their behavior on the same criteria that a woman has to go through
 ab shaayad vah vakt aa gaya he ki yah puuchhen ki bhartiya purushon ko kya kuch alahada karnaa chahie?masalan, kya kisi bhartiya hycourt kaa jaj mahilaon ke bare main aashwast hokar yah kah saktaa he ki ''ek kamjor 'naa' kaa matlab 'haa' ho saktaa he?'' kyon aisa he ki lagbhag samoochaa purush pratishthan purushon ko kaabo main karne kii bajaae mahilaon kii nigaraanee badhaane ko zyada aatur najar aata he?jab hamaari aabaadi main itnaa bada hissaa yuvaaon kaa he to hamaare yahaan sex shiksha kaa str or gunvattta kya he? kyon bhartiya purush duniya ke baaki sabhi ilaakon ke purushon kii tulana main ghar kaa kaamkaaj itnaa kam karte hai? bharat main shikshit mahilaon kii aupchaarik shramashakti main itani kam bhagidaari he?hamaara media itnaa agyani yaa baharaa kyon ho jaataa he, chaahe vah kisi balaatkaar kii ghatana kii kawarej kar rahaa ho yaa ghighiyaane vaale andaaj main kisi mahila shakhsiyat kaa intervyuu lekar use badhaane-chadhaane kii koshish kar rahaa ho jisase hamaare rashtriya akhabaaron kii bikri kaa graph bad jaae? haal hi main shridevi kii maut kii kawarej se ham sabake sir shame se jhuk jane chahie, lekin hamaare media maahaul main to khud par kaabo karnaa yaa apane bheetar jhaankna maano abhishaap he
 Educationist Alka Kurien believes that along with many native feminist movements that have emerged since the beginning of the new century, # metoo also signals the rise of the 'fourth wave' of feminism in India
 ek lekh main ve ise ''mote taur par soshal media nit samgr andolan' ke taur par bataati hai ''jo mahilaon kii aazaadee ko alpsankhyak purushon or mahilaon ke liye saamaajik nyaay kii vrihad maang ke saath jodta he
 "but just as the # metoo movement in America has also allegedly left the working class women and black women in the same way, in India also, # metoo is actually a movement of well-to-do people where only one-fourth of the people have Internet is available and seventy percent of those living online are men
 iskaa matlab yah he ki # metoo andolan ko bhartiya media main mil rahi gaiyr-anupatik tarjeeh ke baavjood uske vaastavik asar ko maapna bahut mushkil he
 Some prominent men were 'beparda', the most recent of which was venture capitalist Mahesh Murthy
 lekin film udyog, media or korporate jagat mote taur par achoota rahaa he
 The Raya government behind it had released a list of academics who were accused of inappropriate sexual behavior by anonymous students
 usase kuch samay hangaamaa hua lekin phir vah masalaa 'uchit prakriya' kii bahes main ulajhakar or nariwadiyon kii puraani peedi ko unke yuva saathiyon ke khilaaf khadaa karke taany taany fiss ho gaya
 We do not mean to say here that due process is non-essential or that there are no issues with anonymous lists that make such general accusations: The government list did a disastrous job, many male professors had their self- Satisfied with a stunned sleep, but still angry that this list was not taken as authentic testimony
 america main award-vijeta kamedian ajij ansaari kaa maamla is baat kaa udhaaharan he ki kaise # metoo andolan punap rahaa he
 a young woman released her account detailing how one evening, Ansari continued to try to force her to have sex despite his apparent discomfort
 kai purushon or kai mahilaon ne bhi is vivaran ko ek 'kharaab date' ke taur par khaarij karne kii koshish kii
 Some even accused the young woman of harming the # metoo movement from an important platform like the op-ed page of the New York Times
 haalanki us mahila ke bachaav main kai mahilaayein utrin or unhone kaha ki unke bhi 'kharaab dat' ke anubhav rahe hai
 Such debates are seen in the elite youth of urban India in cities like Bangalore, Pune and of course Delhi and Mumbai
 lekin soshal media par gusse yaa phir naitik mulyon ke bakhaan se aage usamen kuch na hua
 Without the active participation of men, such dialogue ends either by accusations, or by defending or by reaching the honorable but unsubstantiated promise to 'do better'
 ham iske aage kaise bad sakate hai? is gati ko to banaae rakhaa janaa chahie
 It is important that women as well as men have conversations about issues raised in the # metoo movement, question the ways we are being used in our language, and ask what we do with our culture
 iskaa matlab khyaalon or vichaaron kii paharedaari karnaa nahin he
 i am not in favor of banning whatsapp groups designed to teach books or movies, rap songs, internet pornography or slut sex jokes
 lekin main behatar str kii aalochana ke paksh main hum taaki samvaad kaa atirek rahe
 Indian men should be an open part of this debate
 hamen poochna chahie ki hamaare liye 'mardaangi' kya he or kyon ahm he
 All men have to do to participate in the # metoo movement is not to shrug it off and say that it is not my problem, or to sit in a corner with the feminists in the mouth — just to express a desire to communicate
