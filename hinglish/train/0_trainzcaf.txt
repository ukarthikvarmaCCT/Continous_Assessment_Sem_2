 'shuddh desi gane' kii team kii ore se yah gaanaa sabhi star kids ko dadicate kiya gaya he
 Now more than 122,497 people have watched this video
 salmaan khanke 'main hum hero tera' gane kaa parody video: Rishabh Pant is ready to replace Samson Pant, perform or be ready to be out, former Indian batsman VVS Laxman said that wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant will have to live up to the time given by the team management and if If he does not achieve the rhythm soon, Sanju Samson can replace him
 lakshmana ne kaha ki westeindies ke khilaaf teen maichon kii tii-20 siries kii team main sanju samson kaa chunaa janaa pant ke liye ‘kadaa sandesh’ he ki pradarshan karen yaa phir team se baahar hone ke liye taiyaar rahen
 Laxman told Star Sports, 'the team management and selection committee has given a strong message to Samson in the team that we have a choice
 rishabh pant ko kaaphi maukey mili hai or mujhe yakeen he ki team prabandhan ne usase baat kii hogi
 He said, "the player has to justify the confidence of the team management and the selection committee
 ’purv kalatmak ballebaaj ne kaha, ‘durbhaagya se pant us bharose par khare nahin utar rahe hai, lekin unke paas ‘eks’ factor he
 i still believe that he is a great batsman, who after turning into the field, can turn the match by playing big shots
 ’abhi kuch samay pehle tak pant teenon praroopon main wicketiper ke taur par team kii pehali pasand the, lekin kharaab form ke kaaran test team main unki jagah anbhavi riddhimaan saaha ne le lee
 Laxman said, 'as a batsman he seems confused, there is no doubt that he is under pressure
 aap ne kai baar dekha he, jab vah puure pravaah main khelte hai, to spinneron ke khilaaf unki ek alag maansikta or takanic dikhti he
 i think he will be under a lot of pressure to retain his place in the final-11

 com / jrchkoeudb— Sanju Samson (@iamsanjusamson)november 28, 201945 saal ke is purv ballebaaj ne kaha ki agle saal hone vaale tii-20 vishwa cap se pehle wicketiper ballebaaj ke taur par samson kii jagah ab bhi pant hi pehali pasand honge, lekinmahendra singh dhoni bhi shaayad tab tak vaapasi kar len
 Dhoni has been away from competitive cricket since the Indian team was eliminated in the semi-finals of the World Cup in England in July this year
 dakshin africa or bangladesh ke baad dhoni ab chah disambar se westeindies ke khilaaf shuru ho rahi simit overon kii siries kaa bhi hissaa nahin honge
 Laxman said about Dhoni's future, 'I think Dhoni will watch Pant and Samson's performance with patience
 mujhe lagata he ipel ke baad unhen jab bhi mauka milegaa, vah sanyas ke bare main faisla karenge, dhoni khud ko ipel ke liye taiyaar kar rahe hai
 "laxman said," i am confident that he will do well, as he has done while leading Chennai Super Kings in the past
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘yah donon yuva khilaadi agar maukon ko nahin bhunaa paae
 Then perhaps Dhoni can be thought of
 iske liye unhen vishwa cap se pehle ipel main lay dikhaani hogi
 ' film kii kahani main ek adhed umr kaa insaan apane se aadhi umr kii ladki se dil laga baitha he
 Those who objected to this film love flourishing in the middle of the age gap will now meet aces-dukke, but the real life relationship between the hero-heroine of this film has become the root of the uproar
 reelij hone se pehle vivaadon main ghiririlij hone se pehle hi film jabardast vivaad main ghir gai he
 Because the middle-aged hero of the film, who falls in love with his daughter's heroin in real life, is also the heroine's father
 kannada film 'musanje gelathi'' ke hero bi pi shrinivas or heroin shalini ke bich rishta baap-beti kaa he lekin filmi kirdaar premi-premika kaa
 The story is about a middle-aged professor who falls in love with his daughter's age-old student
 baap- beti karenge parde par romancepuri film adhed professor auki tinej student ke bich ke is asaamaanya rishte ke chaaro taraf gumti he
 People are surprised that in real life how can a father-daughter romance on screen
 sawaalon kaa silsilaa dur tak jaataa he
 It is said that how can a father even think of making such a film with his daughter, and not only our society but also no society in the world can afford to promote such antics
 kala or creativity ke naam par bhi nahin
 The film is scheduled to release on August 28 but protests continue to escalate
 logon ko ye film bhartiya samskruti ke khilaaf lag rahi he
 Because the reality behind the curtain is overshadowing the story of the curtain
 pragati maidan main 18waan vaarshik dilli pustak mela shanivaar ko shuru ho gaya
 The theme of the nine-day book fair will be 'e-books'

 International publishers will include publishers from China, Pakistan, the United States, Britain, France and Germany
 dilli ke uparajyapal tejinder khanna ne meley kaa udghaatan karte hue kaha, "aashaa he ki prakaashak aisi preranadayak pustaken lekar aaenge, jo logon main shanti evam bhaichaare kaa sandesh faillaayengi
 "according to the organizers, the theme of the book fair has been kept 'e-books', which will remain the central point of the fair

 Meaning that everything is visible in politics too
 tabhi to jammu kashmir main ek march ko pidipi-bijepi kaa gathjod satta sanbhaalane ja rahaa he
 It is a different matter that this alliance is not embracing political pundits
 vajah he donon hi dalon kaa vaicharik dharaatal par ek-duusare se bilkul hi juda hona arthath inaki soch thik ek duusare ke vipareet he
 Activists of both the parties are upset with the announcement of this anti-coalition alliance in Delhi
 unki pareshaani yah he ki ve is gathbandhan par khushi manaaen yaa phir matam
 The discussion about this alliance is not only on social media, but also in the streets
 soshal media par to ise matadaataaon ke saath sabase bada dhokhaa kaha ja rahaa he, to jammu ilaake main bijepi kaaryakarta apane virdohi raajnneetik dalon kii un baton kaa jawaab nahin de paa rahe hai jo unhen 'baap-beti' ke raaj se mukti ke naaron kii yaad dilaa rahe hai
 For the first time, BJP won 25 assembly seats, the best ever in the state
 is jeet kaa credit jammu ilaake ke un matadaataaon ko jaataa he, jinhone vaaki 'baap-beti' or 'baap-betaa' ke shashan se mukti kii khatir bijepi ke paksh main jam kar voting kii thi
 These slogans were raised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself in his election meetings and sought votes for BJP
 vaise baap-beti kaa matlab mufti mohammad said tathaa unki beti mahabuuba said he, jabaki baap-betaa kaa matlab faruk abdulla or umr abdulla se tha
 BJP workers are shocked and upset
 bijepi netritv pehali baar rajya main banane ja rahi bijepi gathbandhan vaali sarkaar par khushi manaane ko kah rahi he, to kader ke liye pareshaani yah he ki vah kis baat kii khushi manaae
 The kingdom will again belong to the 'father-daughter'
 mukhyamantri to chah saal ke liye unheen kaa hoga
 PDP activists have some similar situation in Kashmir
 ve ek duusare kaa munh taak rahe hai
 They are going to form a government together with the BJP, against whom people in Kashmir overwhelmingly voted
 tabhi to bijepi kaa kashmir main khaataa bhi nahin khul paaya
 The PDP also distributed votes against the National Conference in Kashmir, not by spewing venom, but by showing fear of the BJP to the Kashmiris
 apni reliyon or bhaashanon main khud mufti mohammad said or mahabuuba mufti ne bijepi ke ghati main badhate kadamon kaa dar kashmiriyon ko dikhaaya tha
 The question of how much the BJP is going to participate in power for the first time in Jammu and Kashmir will come with the PDP
 iske liye bijepi ko apane kai mul muddon se samjhauta karnaa pad rahaa he, jise lekar vah aaj tak raajnneeti karti ai he
 An even bigger question is whether the BJP will be able to fulfill its promise to settle the Kashmiri Pandits who left the Valley in Kashmir
 isamen use pidipi se kitna sahyog mil sakegaa
 If the PDP supports the BJP in this task, it will have to face the displeasure of the people of the valley
 dekha jaae to bijepi or pidipi donon ke liye yah jua khilne se kam nahin he

 Actually, the Trinamool Congress sees a conspiracy to divide the state in this

 There is no place called Gorkhaland in the entire region

 But as long as there is Trinamool Congress here, no one can divide the state
 'vahiin, bista ne kaha ki gorkhaland shabd ke istemaal kaa pruthak rajya ke gathan se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 He said, 'the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) was formed in 2011 following a tripartite agreement between the Trinamool Congress government, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha and the then Congress government at the Center
 aise main yadi ve log gorkhaland shabd kaa istemaal kar sakate hai to ham is kshetra ke bashindon ko sambodhit karne ke liye iskaa istemaal kyon nahin kar sakate hai
 After the Centre's move to abolish most of the provisions of Article 370 giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir and dividing it into two Union Territories, many parties in the Gorkha region have started seeking Union Territory status for Darjeeling

 There is a BJP government in Haryana
 haryana ke bijepi saansad pradhanmantri ke paas ja rahe hai ki punjab ko rokiye jahaan unki party or akali dal kii sarkaar he or jo centre main bhi modi sarkaar kaa hissaa he
 The Congress is in opposition in Punjab and Haryana
 punjab main congress shrey le rahi he ki uske dabaav ke kaaran hi badal sarkaar ko sutluj yamuna link kanal ke liye lee gai zamin waapas kerani pad rahi he
 In Haryana, the Congress party is silent, it did not go to the all-party meeting that was called by Chief Minister Khattar
 is raajnneeti ko samajhnaa aasaan nahin he isliye cricket na dekh rahe hon to bharat mata kii jai koun bolegaa vaali bahes bhi dekhi ja sakati he
 Because this is the best recipe for not understanding nationalism under any circumstances
 baaki slate lekar baith jaaiye ki bharat mata kii jai ke binar tale aane vaale raajnneetik dalon ne pani ko lekar kya game khelaa he
 Farmers have started filling canals near Ropar in Punjab to take back their land
 80 ke dashak main sutluj yamuna kanal ke liye punjab or haryana main zamin kaa adhigrahan hua tha
 The Badal government passed a resolution in the Punjab Legislative Assembly and returned the acquired land of Punjab's share
 punjab sarkaar yah dikhaanaa chaahati he ki wo punjab ke pani kii rakshak he
 The Congress says it has a victory because the original proposal of the Badal government did not mention returning the land
 ye praavdhaan usee ke dabaav ke kaaran aayaa he
 SY Canal is up to 214 km in Punjab and 90 km in Haryana
 iskaa kaaphi bada hissaa ban chukaa he magar pani kaa vitaran shuru nahin hua he
 Punjab did not even think what would happen to the canal that stands in the part of Haryana
 haryana ke hisse vaale kanal main pani to aata he magar wo sutluj kaa nahin he
 It also has its own political aspect once again
 yah ek khataranaak raajnneetik chaal he
 Punjab is saying that it will not provide water to Haryana

 Whether or not the Modi government's opinion will change in the Supreme Court
 haryana kii party indian neshnal lok dal ne punjab vidhansabha ke baahar pradarshan kiya he
 You are aware that in the Haryana Assembly elections, the Indian National Lok Dal made Prakash Singh Badal its star campaigner
 jabaki akali dal centre or rajya main bijepi kii partner he
 No one can come between the friendship of the Chautala and Badal family, but this time the INLD demonstrated against the decision of the Badal family
 is pradarshan main naatakeeyata kitni he or sachai kitna iskaa tharmametre mere paas nahin he
 You only know people vote
 hamen to yahi samaj aayaa ki badal punjab main kisaanon ke hitaishi ban rahe hai or chautaala or khatter haryana main apane kisaanon ke hitaishi ban rahe hai
 Haryana was not getting water already but Akali BJP government will get support of farmers by filling Kanal
 agar iskaa sambandh sirf chunavi raajnneeti se he to punjab ke ranneetikaar jaanate honge ki kitna khataranaak khel khelaa gaya he
 The Aam Aadmi Party, which is trying to expand in Punjab, also has an opinion on this issue
 dilli ke mukhyamantri ne kaha ki punjab ke paas itnaa pani nahin bachaa he ki wo duusare rajyon ko pani de
 Aam Aadmi Party leader and Supreme Court lawyer HS Phoolka says that 17 when the agreement was reached
 17 million acre feet pani tha
 Now its quantity is reduced to 14
 37 million acre feet rah gai he
 Therefore, there should be water sharing in the context of new data
 duusare rajyon ko vaade ke hisaab se pani mil rahaa he lekin punjab ko pani nahin mil rahaa he
 Haryana says that it is not getting its share of water
 mukhyamantri kejariwal ke bayaan par haryana ke netaaon ne kaha ki wo dilli ko pani nahin den to kya hoga
 The Haryana Assembly has also passed a resolution against this statement of Chief Minister Kejriwal
 yah ek aisa mudda he jo aasaani se samaj nahin aata ki koun kidar he
 Now come on the role of Congress
 jis tarah se is baar akali bijepi sarkaar ne kiya he vaisaa hi kuch 2004 main campton amarinder singh kii sarkaar ne kiya tha
 Then Captain Amarinder Singh passed the Punjab Termination of Agreement Act
 is act ke hisaab se punjab ke pani ko lekar hue puraane samjhaute radd ho jate hai yani punjab apana pani kisi ko nahin degaa
 The central government moved the Supreme Court against this act
 maujuuda faisle kaa congress bhi samarthan kar rahi he
 Its mlas are also talking about filling the Sutlej Yamuna Canal
 amarinder singh link kanal ke kinare kinare padayatra bhi karne vaale hai
 There is a water crisis in Punjab, no one can deny it

 Prices of grains are not available
 fasalo kii barbaadi ke baad sahi se muaavze nahin mil rahe hai, isse bhi koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa
 The condition is also bad in Haryana
 uske paas bhi pani nahin he
 The condition of the farmers of Haryana is also not better than Punjab
 pani kii raajnneeti manamaane tareeke se hogi to iskaa rup kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 Haryana should stop supplying Punjab from its highway
 punjab himachal ke seb ko haryana tak nahin pahunchane de
 That is, to create sentiment in Punjab elections, we need to understand what our politics can produce
 1978 main sutluj yamuna link kanal ke liye zamin adhigrahan kaa notification prakaash singh badal ne hi paas kiya tha
 Later Badal went on to say that he had no role
 naukarshahon ne apane aap se iskaa kaam shuru kar diya tha
 But when the Canal started to be formed in 1985, the Akali Dal still had the government
 iske liye punjab ne muaavze ke taur par haryana sarkaar se paise bhi liye the
 The Punjab government returned the same to the Haryana government by making a check of 191 crore 75 lakhs
 haryana sarkaar ko bhi bura laga to usne wo check lautaa diya
 The reality is that this canal is lying abandoned
 isamen pani ke pravaah ko lekar kabhi gambhir prayaas nahin hue hai
 Rajya Sabha MP and former IAS officer MS Gill has written an article in the Indian Express
 unhone pani ke bantwaare ke itihaas ko thodaa samajhaayaa he ki kaise punjab ke saath pani ko lekar ninsaphi hoti rahi or use andhere main rakhkar uske pani kaa faisla centre karata rahaa he
 According to MS Gill, the press has also been presenting Punjab negatively in this matter

 According to MS Gill, the press has also been presenting Punjab negatively in this matter

 punjab ke ropar ke paas kisaan kanal bharne lage hai taaki apni zamin waapas le saken
 In the 80s, land was acquired in Punjab and Haryana for the Sutlej Yamuna Canal
 badal sarkaar ne punjab vidhaan sabha main ek prastaav paas kar punjab ke hisse kii adhigrahit zamin lautaa di he
 The Punjab government wants to show that it is the protector of Punjab's water
 congress kahati he ki uski jeet he kyonki badal sarkaar ke mul prastaav main zamin lautaane kii baat nahin thi
 This provision has come due to the same pressure
 esavai kanal punjab main 214 kimi tak he or haryana main 90 kimi
 a large part of it has been formed but the distribution of water has not started
 punjab ne yah bhi nahin sochaa ki haryana ke hisse main jo kanal banakar khadaa he uskaa kya hoga
 Canal, which is part of Haryana, receives water but is not of Sutlej
 iskaa bhi apana ek raajnneetik pahalu he wo phir kabhi
 This is a dangerous political ploy
 punjab kah rahaa he ki haryana ko pani nahin degaa
 The Chief Minister of Haryana is calling Punjab Chief Minister Badal that please do not do this
 haryana vidhansabha main punjab vidhansabha ke prastaav ke kilaaf prastaav paas kiya gaya he
 The central government has opposed a similar Punjab ruling in the Supreme Court
 modi sarkaar kaa supreme court main mat badalegaa yaa nahin dekhte hai
 The Indian National Lok Dal, the party from Haryana, has staged a protest outside the Punjab Legislative Assembly
 aap jaanate hi hai ki haryana vidhansabha chunaavon main indian neshnal lokdal ne prakaash singh badal ko apana star prachaarak banaaya tha
 While the Akali Dal is a BJP partner in the Center and the state
 chautaala or badal parivaar kii dosti ke bich koi nahin aa saktaa lekin is baar inelo ne badal parivaar ke faisle ke khilaaf pradarshan hi kar diya
 How much of the dramaticness is there in this performance and how much thermometer i do not have
 aap hi log vot dete hai aapako pataa hi hoga
 We understood that Badal is becoming farmers friendly in Punjab and Chautala and Khattar are becoming friendly to their farmers in Haryana
 pani to haryana ko pehle hi nahin mil rahaa tha lekin kanal ko bhar kar akali bijepi sarkaar kisaanon kaa samarthan paa legi
 If it only deals with electoral politics, then Punjab strategists will know how dangerous the game has been played
 punjab main vistaar kaa prayaas kar rahi aam aadmi party kii bhi is masale par raay he
 The Chief Minister of Delhi said that Punjab does not have enough water to provide water to other states
 aam aadmi party ke netaa or supreme court main vakil ech es phulka kaa kahana he ki jab samjhauta hua tha tab 17
 There was 17 million acre feet of water
 ab isaki maatra kam hokar 14
 37 million acres have been left
 isliye nae aankadon ke sandarbh main pani kaa bantwaaraa hona chahie
 Other states are getting water as promised but Punjab is not getting water
 haryana kaa kahana he ki use uske hisse kaa pani nahin mil rahaa he
 On the statement of Chief Minister Kejriwal, the Haryana leaders said that what should happen if they do not give water to Delhi 
 haryana vidhansabha ne mukhyamantri kejariwal ke is bayaan ke kilaaf prastaav bhi paas kiya he
 This is an issue that is not easily understood who is where
 ab aate hai congress ke role par
 The way the Akali BJP government did this time, the same was done by the Captain Amarinder Singh government in 2004
 tab captain amarinder singh ne punjab termination of agreement act paas kar diya
 According to this act, the old agreements regarding water of Punjab are canceled, that is, Punjab will not give its water to anyone
 tabaki centre sarkaar is act ke kilaaf supreme court main chali gai
 The Congress is also supporting the current decision
 uske vidhayak bhi sutluj yamuna kanal ko bharne kii baat kar rahe hai
 Amarinder Singh is also going to undertake a padyatra along the banks of the Link Canal
 punjab main pani kaa sankat he, isse koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa
 No one can deny that the water level is continuously going down
 anaajon ke daam nahin mil rahe hai
 No one can deny that compensation is not being received right after the destruction of crops
 haryana main bhi haalat karaab he
 He also has no water
 haryana ke kisaanon kii haalat bhi punjab se koi behatar nahin he
 If the politics of water is arbitrary, then its form can be anything
 haryana apane haive se punjab kii supplai roak de
 Punjab should not allow Himachal's apple to reach Haryana
 matlab punjab ke chunaav main bhavukta paidaa karne ke liye hamaari raajnneeti kya kya paidaa kar sakati he ise samajhane kii zarurat he
 In 1978, the notification of land acquisition for Sutlej Yamuna Link Canal was passed by Prakash Singh Badal
 baad main badal kehane lage ki unki koi bhoomika nahin thi
 Bureaucrats started working on their own
 magar jab 1985 main kanal bananaa shuru hua tab bhi akali dal kii hi sarkaar thi
 For this, Punjab also took money from the Haryana government as compensation
 vahi paisa yani 191 karod 75 lakh kaa check banaakar punjab sarkaar ne haryana sarkaar ko waapas kar diya
 If the Haryana government felt bad, he returned the check
 hakeekat ye he ki yah kanal laavaaris padaa hua he
 There has never been any serious effort in this
 rajyasabha saansad or purv iees adhikari em es gil ne indian express main ek lekh likhaa he
 He has explained a bit about the history of water sharing, how injustice has been done with Punjab over water and keeping it in the dark has been the center of its decision
 em es gil ke anusaar press bhi punjab ko is maamle main nakaaratmak rup se pesh karata rahaa he
 Gill has written that through an administrative order in 1955, the Center gave a large portion of Punjab's water to Rajasthan, which had no authority over Punjab's water
 punjab ke paas 7
 2 MAF water is left
 jise haryana himachal or punjab ke bich baant diya gaya
 Yamuna river used to come in United Punjab but Yamuna water never got to Punjab
 jabaki use bina bataaye yamuna ke pani ko haryana upi or rajasthan ke bich baant diya gaya
 But there is never news of a fight with Rajasthan
 punjab haryana ke bich hi jal ko lekar mall yuddh kyon chalata rahata he
 Gill has written another point that when he started speaking in the Rajya Sabha, no member had any idea what the issue was
 baad main kai sadsy unke paas gaye ki zaraa bataaiye ki he kya ye maamla
 The comments sutluj yamuna link nahar ke mudde par haryana sarkaar ne supreme court main guhaar lagaai he
 The Haryana government has said that the Supreme Court should appoint a court receiver for the canal with immediate effect
 ye resiver centre yaa koi or agency kaa ho saktaa he
 The receiver should take possession of the land and papers etc
 is maamle main nae halaat paidaa ho gaye hai, supreme court jald aadesh jari kare
 Because Punjab has already passed the bill to return the land and sent it for notification
 act lagu hone se pehle hi is dauraan vahaan link nahar ko paatane kaa kaam bhi shuru kar diya gaya he
 In the Supreme Court, 5 judges have given a decision to maintain the status quo after hearing
 akali dal ne kaha he ki punjab ke pani par haryana kaa koi haq nahin he
 If every state starts saying the same thing, what will be the situation in the country today
 supreme court kaa hawala dekar is masale se bachaa nahin ja saktaa
 Its political solution has to be found immediately
 punjab, haryana, rajasthan or centre main bijepi or akali kii hi sarkaar he
 Then why are these political situations and that too when the elections are approaching
 kya ye sab jaanboojh kar ho rahaa he yaa vaaki isse punjab ke kisaanon kaa bhala hone vaala he
 The captain of Haryana Punjab is Captain Singh Solanki
 kya ve vidhansabha ke is kanoon ko manzuri dene se inkaar kar sakate hai
 This is a dangerous political ploy
 punjab kah rahaa he ki haryana ko pani nahin degaa
 The Chief Minister of Haryana is calling Punjab Chief Minister Badal that please do not do this
 haryana vidhansabha main punjab vidhansabha ke prastaav ke kilaaf prastaav paas kiya gaya he
 The central government has opposed a similar Punjab ruling in the Supreme Court
 modi sarkaar kaa supreme court main mat badalegaa yaa nahin dekhte hai
 The Indian National Lok Dal, the party from Haryana, has staged a protest outside the Punjab Legislative Assembly
 aap jaanate hi hai ki haryana vidhansabha chunaavon main indian neshnal lokdal ne prakaash singh badal ko apana star prachaarak banaaya tha

 Haryana says that it is not getting its share of water
 mukhyamantri kejariwal ke bayaan par haryana ke netaaon ne kaha ki wo dilli ko pani nahin den to kya hoga
 The Haryana Assembly has also passed a resolution against this statement of Chief Minister Kejriwal
 yah ek aisa mudda he jo aasaani se samaj nahin aata ki koun kidar he
 Now come on the role of Congress
 jis tarah se is baar akali bijepi sarkaar ne kiya he vaisaa hi kuch 2004 main campton amarinder singh kii sarkaar ne kiya tha
 Then Captain Amarinder Singh passed the Punjab Termination of Agreement Act
 is act ke hisaab se punjab ke pani ko lekar hue puraane samjhaute radd ho jate hai yani punjab apana pani kisi ko nahin degaa
 The central government moved the Supreme Court against this act
 maujuuda faisle kaa congress bhi samarthan kar rahi he
 Its mlas are also talking about filling the Sutlej Yamuna Canal
 amarinder singh link kanal ke kinare kinare padayatra bhi karne vaale hai
 There is a water crisis in Punjab, no one can deny it
 jalastr lagaataar neeche ja rahaa he isse bhi koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa
 Prices of grains are not available
 fasalo kii barbaadi ke baad sahi se muaavze nahin mil rahe hai, isse bhi koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa
 The condition is also bad in Haryana
 uske paas bhi pani nahin he
 The condition of the farmers of Haryana is also not better than Punjab
 pani kii raajnneeti manamaane tareeke se hogi to iskaa rup kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 Haryana should stop supplying Punjab from its highway
 punjab himachal ke seb ko haryana tak nahin pahunchane de
 That is, to create sentiment in Punjab elections, we need to understand what our politics can produce
 1978 main sutluj yamuna link kanal ke liye zamin adhigrahan kaa notification prakaash singh badal ne hi paas kiya tha
 Later Badal went on to say that he had no role
 naukarshahon ne apane aap se iskaa kaam shuru kar diya tha
 But when the Canal started to be formed in 1985, the Akali Dal still had the government
 iske liye punjab ne muaavze ke taur par haryana sarkaar se paise bhi liye the
 The Punjab government returned the same to the Haryana government by making a check of 191 crore 75 lakhs
 haryana sarkaar ko bhi bura laga to usne wo check lautaa diya
 The reality is that this canal is lying abandoned
 isamen pani ke pravaah ko lekar kabhi gambhir prayaas nahin hue hai
 Rajya Sabha MP and former IAS officer MS Gill has written an article in the Indian Express
 unhone pani ke bantwaare ke itihaas ko thodaa samajhaayaa he ki kaise punjab ke saath pani ko lekar ninsaphi hoti rahi or use andhere main rakhkar uske pani kaa faisla centre karata rahaa he
 According to MS Gill, the press has also been presenting Punjab negatively in this matter
 gil ne likhaa he ki 1955 main ek prashasnic aadesh ke zariye centre ne punjab ke pani kaa bada hissaa rajasthan ko de diya jiskaa punjab ke pani par koi adhikaar nahin tha
 7 near Punjab
 2 emeef pani hi bachaa he
 Which was divided between Haryana, Himachal and Punjab
 sanyukt punjab main yamuna nadi bhi aati thi lekin yamuna kaa pani punjab ko kabhi nahin mila
 Whereas Yamuna water was distributed between Haryana UP and Rajasthan without informing him
 lekin rajasthan ke saath to kabhi ladaai kii khabar nahin aati
 Why is the Malla war going on between Punjab and Haryana
 gil ne ek or baat likhi he ki jab unhone rajyasabha main bolnaa shuru kiya to kisi sadsy ko andaaza nahin tha ki ye masalaa kya he
 Later many members went to him to tell us what is the matter
 tippaniyan Haryana Government has approached the Supreme Court on the issue of Sutlej Yamuna Link Canal
 haryana sarkaar ne kaha he ki nahar ke liye supreme court tatkaal prabhaav se court resiver niyukt kare
 It can be from the receiver center or some other agency
 resiver zamin or kaagazaton aadi ko apane kabze main le le
 New circumstances have arisen in this case, the Supreme Court should issue an order soon
 kyonki punjab ne pehle hi zamin waapas karne ke liye bill paas kar diya or notification ke liye bheja he
 Before the Act comes into force, the work of bridging the link canal there has also started
 supreme court main 5 jajon ne sunne ke baad yathasthiti banaae rakhane kaa faisla diya he
 The Akali Dal has said that Haryana has no right over Punjab's water
 yahi baat agar har rajya kehane lage to aaj desh main kya sthiti hogi
 This issue cannot be avoided by citing the Supreme Court
 iskaa raajnneetik samaadhaan turant nikaalnaa hi hoga
 In Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and at the center, the BJP and the Akali government only
 phir ye raajnneetik halaat kyon hai or wo bhi chunaav ke nazadik aane par
 Is all this being done deliberately or is it really going to benefit the farmers of Punjab
 haryana punjab ke garvanar captain singh solanki hi hai
 Can they refuse to approve this legislation of the Legislative Assembly
 tab captain amarinder singh ne punjab termination of agreement act paas kar diya
 According to this act, the old agreements regarding water of Punjab are canceled, that is, Punjab will not give its water to anyone
 tabaki centre sarkaar is act ke kilaaf supreme court main chali gai

 jise haryana himachal or punjab ke bich baant diya gaya
 Yamuna river used to come in United Punjab but Yamuna water never got to Punjab

 There was a sudden stir in a posh society in Ghaziabad
 sosayadi ke ekaflatt main ek mahila kii laashapadi mili
 The husband was adamant that his wife had died in the bathroom but suddenly the police saw something in the bedroom that opened up the whole case of death
 jagah- goud global village, ghaziabad, taarikh-12 march, samay-dopaher 12:30 baje
 This afternoon someone from the posh residential area of ghaziabad called the police
 phone karne vaale shaks kii awaz main kaasi bechaini thi
 He said, 'hello Police? You are speaking to the police
 ? aap jaldi aa jaaie
 My wife has fallen in the bathroom while bathing
 use bahut chot ai he
 i think maybe something happened to him
 pleez aap jaldi aa jaaie
 "but where are you from Bol
 
 ? '' From G
 Gaur Global Village, Crossing Republic
 flats number 1816, bi block
 'exactly twenty minutes after this short conversation, the police of Vijay Nagar police station was in the flat from where this call was made
 haalanki police se pehle hi kuch padosi mauka e vaardaat par pahunch chuke the
 But the scene of the house was so terrible that upon seeing it, the steps of the policemen stopped
 vaise to phone karanevaale shaks ne bataaya tha ki uski patni kii maut bathroom main girane kii vajah se hui he
 But the condition of the chance-e-crime was very mysterious
 andar daakhil hone ke baad police ne sabase pehle us bathroom kaa rukh kiya, jahaan ye haadasa hua tha
 Police found that a portion of the commode in the bathroom was broken, while blood splattered all over a large part of the house from the bathroom to the bedroom
 zaahir he police ke saath-saath vahaan maujuud tamaam logon ko ye samaj main nahin aa rahaa tha ki akhir yahaan rahanevaali mahila nahaate vakt bathroom main aise kaise giri ki uski jaan hi chali gai? camod tut gaya? or puure ghar main koon ke chhinte bikhar gaye? zaahir he, mauka e vaardaat ke har zarre main ek sawaal chupa tha
 The police arrived in the bedroom chasing the blood splatter, but what he saw upon reaching there was even more shocking
 garaz ye ki bedroom main metress kaa ek bada hissaa koon se sanaa tha or yahaan rahanevaali 30 saal kii mahila ruchi kii laash bistar par aundhe munh padi thi
 However, there was not a single cloth on his body, which from the view it seemed that he probably died while taking a bath
 lekin police ko mauka-e-vaardaat ke muyne ke baad paidaa hue sawaalon kaa jawaab jaananaa tha, lihaaza usne sabase pehle ruchi ke pati mohit se hi poochtacha karne kaa faisalaa kiya
 Mohit's condition was not good
 wo sadame main tha
 But he told the police, 'when he and Ruchi were in the house at around 11 in the morning, Ruchi went to the bathroom to take a bath and perhaps he slipped in the bathroom due to slipping his feet there
 
 
 uskaa sir camod se laga or use itani bhayanak chot lagi ki uski jaan chali gai
 Mohit's story was straightforward and flat
 
 But certainly not worth doing
 vajah ye ki camod se sir takaraane par sir to foot saktaa tha, lekin yun camod ke hi tukade ho jaaenge, ye maananaa thodaa mushkil tha
 Now the police asked Mohit some more questions
 usne poocha ki apni patni ruchi ke bathroom main gir jane ke baad usne use kisi doctor ke paas le jane yaa phir padosiyon ko bulaane kii bajaay apane rishtedaaron or police ko phone kyon kiya? is par mohit kaa kahana tha ki chunki ruchi ke girane ke saath hi maut ho gai thi, use laga ki ab doctor ko bulaane kaa koi faaydaa nahin he
 Apparently, Mohit's answer was also under question
 lekin iske thodi hi der baad mauka e vaardaat par police kii nazar ek aisi chiz par padi ki bathroom main gir kar ruchi kii maut kii ye kahani achaanak sir ke bal khadi ho gai
 It seemed like the opposite was true
 mohit kii maane to uski patni kii maut bathroom main girane kii vajah se hui thi
 But when the police came to Mohit's flat for investigation, the eye of a cricket bat lying in the corner of his bedroom got torn
 vajah ye ki is balle par gend ke nishaan nahin, balki koon ke dhabbe the
 In this flat of Ghaziabad's posh locality, software engineer Mohit Sharma lived with his wife Ruchi and nine-year-old son on rent
 mul rup se jaipur ke rahanevaale mohit ko ab uske home toun main hi naukari mil gai thi, wo agle ek-do dinon main hi teenon jaipur shift honevaale the
 But before the Sharma family left Ghaziabad, this incident happened
 mohit to apni patni kii maut ke peeche bathroom main uske achaanak gir jane kii vajah bataa rahaa tha, lekin mauka e vaardaat ke halaat kuch or hi ishaara kar rahe the
 Meanwhile, the police caught sight of one such thing lying in the corner of the bedroom near the corpse of interest
 ye chiz thi cricket kaa ek balla
 Yes, a bat that had some long hair and blood on its lower back
 ab police ne bagaiyr vakt ganvaae ye balla zabt kar liya or use forensik jaanch ke liye bhijwa diya
 Simultaneously started a fresh interrogation of Mohit
 police ko mauka e vaardaat ke halaat or mohit se ab tak hui poochtacha se shaq to pehle hi ho rahaa tha
 
 
 Now this bat increased his suspicion even further
 usne ab sidhe mohit ke saamne sawaalon kii jhadi laga di
 He asked, - If Ruchi died due to falling in the bathroom, where did the hair and blood on this bat come from? - If Ruchi had fallen in the bathroom while taking bath, then how did he open the bathroom door from outside ? - Why did he not go to the doctor on interest in the injury? - How did the part of the commode in the bathroom break? - Where did the blood splatter all over the house? And most importantly
 
 
 --uske sir main ek nahin kai chotein kaise lageen?in sawaalon ko sun kar jaise mohit kii ghiggi bandha gai
 He could not understand what to answer if he responded to the police and then Mohit broke down in the next few minutes
 usne police ke saamne kubul kar liya ki ruchi kii maut bathroom main girane kii vajah se nahin hui, balki khud usee ne apane haathon se ruchi kaa qatl kiya he or wo bhi usee balle se jisase maar-maar kar ruchi kii jaan lene ke baad usne jise bedroom main hi phenk rakhaa tha
 But now the question was that if Mohit was interested in murder, then why did he do it? People nearby and relatives of both also failed to understand Mohit's cause
 vajah ye thi ki mohit or ruchi ke bich ab tak kabhi kisi baat ko lekar aisi koi ladaai bhi nahin hui, jo kabhi ghar kii charadivari se baahar nikali ho
 People were assuming that everything is going well in their life, but now the situation is going to be even better if Mohit gets a job in home town
 lekin isi bich akhir aisa kya hua ki padhe-likhe or samajhadaar mohit ne ek aisa qadam uthaa liya, jiske bare main koi soch bhi nahin saktaa tha
 When the investigation went ahead and the story behind it came out, there was no surprise of the listeners

 After the disclosure of this note, three ministers reached Pranab's house late at night

 In the PMO, between the Minister of State v Narayan Sami, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Bansal, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Rajiv Shukla, 2G, the political mercury of Delhi suddenly rose when the three ministers reached Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee's house late on Wednesday night
 atakalon kaa daur shuru hua ki ye mantri pi chidambaram ke saath mache ghamaasan main pranab mukherjee ko manaane gaye hai yaa phir sarkaar kii taraf se koi ranneeti taiyaar karne

 After the fatigue of the day, if you are not able to sleep peacefully at night, then it can be a sign of impending danger
 kya aapke saath bhi aisa hota he ki bich raat main hi aapaki neend kisi anjaan dar se khul jaati he? kai logon ke saath aisa bhi hota he ki ve sapane main baichaiyn ho jate hai or paseene-paseene hokar uth baithte hai
 a busy life, office stress, insecurity and bitterness in relationships never let you sleep peacefully
 par ye anidra nahin he
 In insomnia, a person does not sleep, while in this problem he sleeps but opens in the middle
 kai baar insaan ko sote-sote itani ghabrahat mahasoos hoti he ki uski ankhen khul jaati hai
 Reason: There may be several reasons for intermittent sleep
 kai baar tanaav itnaa hota he ki insaan chintaa ke kaaran chaiyn kii neend nahin le paata
 Many times a bad and scary incident of childhood does not let anyone sleep
 iske alaava agar aap asuraksha kii bhaavana se peedit hai to bhi aapako chaiyn kii neend kam hi aati hogi
 What are the measures: 1
 agar aapaki neend bhi bich raat main khul jaati he to usase pareshaan hone ke badale ye sochna shuru kar den ki aisa kyon ho rahaa he
 2
 sone se pehle koi kitaab padhein
 Doing so calms the mind and brings peace
 3
 Sleeping while listening to music is also a better solution
 4
 Spread a nice scent in your room
 aisa karne se mood acha hota he or neend acchhee aati he
 5
 son se pehle halke or hawaadaar kapade pahanen
 Clean hands, feet and mouth thoroughly before sleeping so that the fatigue of the day is gone
 aap chahen to yoga kaa bhi sahaara le sakate hai
 What can cause problems: 1
 vyavhaar menchidchidapan or aakraamakata2
 Digestive effect and constipation problem 3
 madhumeh hone kaa khatra or dil se judi bimaariyaan hone kii ashanka4

 Every relationship demands time and dedication and this is the most important thing for love affairs
 prem sambandhon ko khushhaal or sukhad banaae rakhane ke liye donon hi pakshon ko prayaas karne kii jarurat hoti he lekin ye prayaas kabhi bhi jabaran thope hue nahin hone chahie
 If efforts are voluntary, then the warmth of the relationship lasts for a long time
 par kai baar aisa bhi hota he ki jis rishte ko ham jeevanabhar kaa saath maanakar shuru karte hai wo bich raah main hi dhokhaa de jaataa he
 In such a situation, it is very important to test how strong your relationship is and will it be able to support you for a lifetime? If you want, you can test your relationship on the basis of these things: 1
 agar aapako is rishte main kuch bhi kehane yaa karne ke liye do baar sochna pad rahaa he to samaj lijie ki ye rishta aapke liye sahi he
 In a relationship that does not have so much freedom that you can keep your point clear, it would be better to break away from that relationship
 2
 If you are giving enough space to your partner and he does not interrupt you for everything then this is the identity of a successful relationship
 kisi bhi rishte main jarurat se zyada roak-tok or spes na dena us rishte ke liye hi khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 3
 har rishte menkuch baton par matbhed hona saamaanya he
 But the important thing is that how do you resolve your quarrels and how soon
 4
 This is a very important thing
 kisi bhi rishte main bharose kaa hona bahut jaruri he
 If you can share all the secrets of your heart with your partner then it means that you are in a healthy relationship
 5
 The more true the relationship is, the better
 aise rishton kii umr bahut kam hoti he jo dikhaave kii neenv par banate hai

 When we think of making women financially self-reliant, some of the traditional occupations come to our mind like beauty parlors, teaching, cooking, sewing and weaving etc
 lekin aaazaad foundation ke tahat "vimen on wheels'' project shuru karne vaali minu vadera ko auraton ko aatmanirbhar to bananaa tha lekin paramparaagat tareekon se nahin
 They wanted to make women financially self-reliant, as well as to break the notion or, say, the masculine thinking of which women are considered unsafe outside the home
 lihaaja vadera ne aise hi ek gaiyr-paramparaagat soch or pitrusatta ko chunauti dene vaale peshey kii talash shuru kar di
 a work which can fill the confidence of women that the world outside is also for them and they need to face it rather than being afraid of it
 tabhi unke jehan main "ladi driver'' banane kaa khyaal aayaa
 Born in a middle-class family in the capital, Delhi, Wadera says, "as a professional driver, the idea of women gave me an idea that i could hit two with one stone
" auraton ko aatmanirbhar banane kaa meraa sapana or ghar se baahar auraton ke liye asurakshit duniya kaa bhay dikhaane vaali mardwaadi soch par chot karne kaa meraa junun—donon ek saath puure ho rahe the
 Wadera, the daughter of a mother and father who came to India from Pakistan at the time of Partition, says that she shared the idea with her family
 unki maa teacher thim or ladakiyon ke adhikaron ko lekar behad sajag
 Probably because Wadera is only three sisters
 ghar main sabko yah idia acha laga
 Yes, some people of the neighborhood must have pointed out that now she is going to be a driver
 vadera ne institute of rural management (iarame), aanand se post graduate or landan skool of iconomics se soshal deveopment evam public policy main snatakottar kii degree hasil karne ke baad rajasthan kii ek sanstha "urmul'' apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kii
 Worked on the health issues of rural women here, involved with creative works like seed bank and fodder depot
 vadera bataati hai ki mahilaon ke ghar ke bheetar surakshit hone or baahar nikalate hi khatre main padane kii avadharana mardwaadi soch kii hi upaj he, jabaki auraton ke khilaaf hone vaale aparaadhon par gaur karen to sabase zyada hinsa ghar ke bheetar hoti he
 Exploring the world of a confined world for women, she suddenly asks, "don't you think this is a deep conspiracy of patriarchal thinking?" Says 54-year-old Meenu while training girls It is also said that what are the possible risks when we get out on the road
 unase nibatane ke tareeke bhi bataae jate hai
 The idea of a female driver is still not liked by many people, so the challenges remain
 unki sanstha main sabase zyada anusuchit jati or alpsankhyak tabake kii ladkiyaan training leti hai
 Even if the people of their families accept the idea of making them financially self-reliant, the issue of making women a driver does not get embraced
 is soch ko badalane main sabase zyada mehnat kerani padati he
 But Wadera is an advocate of women's economic freedom and knows how to meet these challenges
 ve kahati hai, "hamane 2008 main vimen on wheels project kii shuruyaat kii thi or ham aaj takreeban 1,600 ladakiyon ko ham trend kar chuke hai
 About 700 of these girls are working somewhere as professional drivers
 hamaari sahyogi sanstha "sakha'' ke jariye ham booking lete hai
 Our clients are Fine Hotels, pwc C, g Adventures, US Embassy
 ''vadera ke project main prashikshan praapt ladkiyaan privet driver ke rup main bhi kaam karti hai
 The housemates feel safe when they are lady drivers
 ankhon main chamak ke saath ve chahakate hue bataati hai, '' hamaare yahaan kii ek 'ladi driver' kaa sellection unicef main ho gaya he
 
 
 
 kya aap kalpana karengi ki 45 hajaar rupee uski selary he
 The salary from which Poonam comes, cannot even imagine this salary
 unki ankhon or baton main utsaah saaf dekha ja saktaa tha
 She adds, Our girls are hurting fiercely on the masculine thinking, the excitement of their eyes and the depth of their dreams were reflected in their eyes
 ve aage kahati hai, kalpana kiijie ki agar sadakon par daudti bason main bhi ladi driver or conductor hon to phir sadak par raat ke sannaate par chalati bas kaa khauf dikhaane vaale logon ke munh main taale lag jaaenge, bedadak mahilaayein baahar nikal sakengi
 Meenu had no idea because the first woman driver of Delhi Bus Service is the only woman to take training from 'women on Wheels' organization
 lekin phir hairaani ke bhav se bharkar minu bataati hai, do saal pehle kuch paanch-chah ladakiyon kaa test dilli bas sarvice main unki sanstha ne dilvaaya tha
 However, only one girl was selected
 hairaani ke bhav se bharkar ve bataati hai, aapako pataa he ki baaki ladkiyaan kyon nahin chuni gayi? gender biked technology kii vajah se
 The driver needs a five-fit two-inch height in Delhi
 isaki vajah poochne par pataa chalaa ki darasal lo floor bason kii siten adjestable nahi hai
 While the average height of girls in their country is five fit
 main hairaan rah gai ki technology main bhi hamaare desh kii gender biked he
 Now our organization has started working deeply on gender bias technology
 bich main hi apni baat ko rokte hue minu kahati hai ye dekhie bhavishya kii diggaj ‘ladi driver’ aa gayi
 Farzana and Rohini are still learning to drive
 ye poochne par ki un donon ke sapanom kii gaadi koun si he to farjaana fat se bolti hai, 'jaguaar'
 i wish Jaguar's steering ever came into my hands and i shove my car at high speed in the busiest road of the city
 ' farjaana darasal keval apni hi nahin balki un sabhi ladakiyon kii ichha jaahir kar rahi thi jinke bheetar bachapan se hi baahar kaa khauf bhar diya jaataa he
 For them, both roads and speed are limited
 darasal vadera mahilaon ko driving kaa hunar sikhaakar unhen na keval gaadi kii driving seat par baitha rahi hai, balki unhen khud mukhtaar yaa apni marji kii maalik bana rahi hai
 In this way, they are being taught to decide their own life

 Flowers without saying a word easily open every secret of your mind

 No matter how expensive a gift you give, it is incomplete without flowers
 tohfe aapke dil kii baat nahin kehete
 On Valentine's Day, we have the highest demand for red roses
 magar is saal ek nayaa trend he, laal gulab main bhi zyada maang desi gulab kii he
 In hybrid roses, we need to exude fragrance, but domestic roses have a natural fragrance
 ’unhone bataaya, ‘is saal gulab ke alaava arched or jarbera kii maang bhi bahut zyada he
 Due to the convenience of home delivery, booking is also getting good at us

 If there is an emptiness in your life without them, then give orange rose
 agar shaadi ke liye propose karnaa chaahate hai to ‘gadhe laal rang’ ke gulab ke saath anguthi den
 What are you thinking then? Just get up and express love
 dilli BJP adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne rajdhani main chhath puja ke liye yamuna nadi ke kinare ghaaton kii saaf-safai or anya taiyaariyon ko lekar mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Manoj Tiwari, who hails from Bihar, also drew Kejriwal's attention to the problems during the Chhath Puja during the last few years and the government's negligence

 In a meeting chaired by Purvanchal Morcha president Shamanish Singh, Manoj Tiwari heard the problems of the Puja committees and demanded that the Kejriwal government call a high-level meeting to arrange Chhath Puja
 saath hi unhone teenon nagar nigamon ko bhi vyavastha main purna sahyog karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 Addressing hundreds of office-bearers present on the occasion, Tiwari said that lakhs of followers of Delhi settled in Chhath Mahaparva perform Chhath Puja every year in Delhi and the Delhi government should rise above party politics and understand their feelings
 unhone kaha, "kejariwal sarkaar chhath puja samitiyon ko apamaanit kar aasthaa ke mahaparv main raajnneeti kii gunjaaish dhund rahi he, jo durbhagyapurna he
 "the officials of the Chhath Puja committees told Manoj Tiwari that preparations for Chhath Puja system in north west Delhi including Kiradi and in many areas of South Delhi including Mehrauli are still lagging behind, and it is necessary to pay attention to this
 saath hi unhone bataaya kimaatr chaar din sheshhain or abhi chote parkon main banane vaale asthaayee ghaaton kaa kaary bhi adhuraa he
 Tiwari assured the office bearers of the Puja committees that thousands of workers of the three Municipal Corporations of Delhi and the BJP would do their utmost to address the problems faced by Chhath Puja
 tiwari ne kaha ki kaaryakarta nigam adhikariyon or karmchaariyon kaa manobal badhayenge or shramdan kar ghaaton ko svachh karne kaa puraa prayaas karenge, jisase chhath ghat par aane vaale vratadhariyon ko koi dikkat na ho
 He said that for the sake of fasting, BJP will also set up camp at Chhat Ghat
 pradhanmantrinarendra modine buudhvaar ko gujarat kenarmadake kevadiyaa main sardaar vallabh bhai patel kii duniya kii sabase oonchi pratimaa stachu of unity kaa udghaatan kiya
 Addressing a huge public meeting on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that if he remembers the work of Sardar Patel for a moment, it would be known that if he were not there, to see the lions of the Gir, worship the Shiva devotees at Somnath and see the Charminar Had to take a visa
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki aaj jab dharti se lekar aasmaan tak sardaar sahab kaa abhishek ho rahaa he, tab bharat ne na sirf apane liye ek nayaa itihaas rachaa he, balki bhavishya ke liye prerana kaa gaganchumbi aadhaar bhi rakhaa he
 The Prime Minister said, today the whole country is celebrating National Unity Day, youth are doing run for unity
 ye kshan bharat ke itihaas main ek mahatvapurn kshan he
 This is the moment to give proper place to a great personality of history
 aaj bharat ke vartmaan ne apane itihaas main ek svarnim purush ko ubaarane kaa kaam kiya he
 Today Sardar Saheb is being anointed from the earth to the sky
 ye bharat kaa ek nayaa itihaas he
 Prime Minister Modi said, when i imagined it as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, it was not thought that one day as Prime Minister i will get the opportunity to do this pious work
 aaj kaa din itihaas se koi mitaa nahin paaegaa
 The first piece of iron was handed to me
 ahmedabad jis dhvaj ko fahraaya gaya wo bhi mujhe upharswaroop diya gaya
 From villages across the country, soil was sought from farmers
 kheti main kaam aane vaale aujaar ke lohe daan karne ko kaha gaya tha
 The people of the country made it a mass movement
 jab ye vichaar maine rakhe the, to kai ashankaayen mere saamne rakhi gayi lekin sab dur ho gayi
 The Prime Minister said, this highest statue of the world will remind the whole world and our future generations of the courage, strength and determination of Sardar Saheb
 sardaar sahab ke isi samvaad se, ekikaran kii shakti ko samajhate hue unhone apane rajyon kaa vilay kar diya
 Soon, India became one
 sardaar sahab ke aahvaan par desh ke saikadon rajavaadon ne tyaag kii misaal kaayam kii thi
 We should also never forget this sacrifice
 ek shaks subah-subah ghar se nikalataa he
 Some people follow him, then, on seeing the opportunity, shoot at him
 lagaataar chaar goli lagane ke baad wo shaks sadak par hi dam tod detaa he
 All these incidents of Patna were captured in CCTV cameras
 daldali road mandir ke paas lage do sisitivi camaron main ek rongte khadey karne vaali tasviir kaid hoti he
 The man, who was running away from his enemies, had no news about the two men hiding behind the car earlier
 lekin chunki donon pehle se vahaan ghaat lagaae baithe hai, unke achaanak uth khadey hone se unki or bhaag rahe shaks kii duuri bilkul kam ho jaati he
 In this, a man who got up from the back of the car again lurks there, but the other chases him fast
 wo daudte hue hi apane haathon main thame pistal ko bhaag rahe shaks par tanakar phir use nishane par lene kii koshish karata he
 Even after begging Rahm, the person does not have mercy on the murderer and shoots him
 lekin goli chalaane ke dauraan hadabadi main hamalavar khud hi sadak par gir jaataa he
 Then he gets up and runs towards the front
 isi bich ek doosraa hamalavar kareeb aata he or bilkul kareeb se uske sir main goli maar detaa he
 After being shot in the head, he longs for some time and then dies here
 duniya bhar main aparaadhiyon or aatankiyon par nakel kasne ke liye interpol ab 'silver notice' ke jariye karwaai karegaa
 Under this, the Interpol Police of the world will be connected through a silver notice to take direct action against such criminals or terrorists whose property or bank accounts are abroad
 jiske khilaaf silver notice jari hoga uski sampati kisi bhi desh main ho, jabt kar lee jaaegi, bank acounts seez kar die jaaenge or kisi bhi tarah kii funding roak di jaaegi
 This was said by CBI Director Anil Kumar Sinha and Interpol Secretary General Jurgen Stock in a program of CBI and Interpol

 Om Prakash Rajbhar, leader of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (bhaspa), an ally who has made the BJP difficult for many times, has also announced to field his candidates
 mana ja rahaa tha ki bijepi loksabhaa chunaav tak opi rajbhar ko manaa legi lekin aisa ho nahin paaya
 But despite the announcement of their candidates, BJP is not in the mood to give more attention
 opi rajbhar kii akad or bijepi kii manshaa ko samajhane ke liye hamen saal 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav se is puri samajhnaa hoga
 In this election, in almost 20 seats of Purvanchal like Ballia, Ghazipur, Mau, Azamgarh, Varanasi, the candidates of Bhaspa got so many votes that they realized their strength in these areas
 in ilaakon main lagbhag 18 hazaar se 5 xxrep 4 0 tak vot mili par seat koi bhi nahin mil pai
 Then Om Prakash Rajbhar realized that he could not get the key to power without a strong shoulder
 lihaaja 2014 main unhen koi majboot kandhaa to nahin mila par unheen kii tarah usee ilaake kii ek kshetreey party kaumi ekta dal kaa saath zarur mila
 Afzal Ansari from Ballia and Om Prakash Rajbhar from Salempur were themselves candidates from the alliance of the Qaumi Ekta Dal and the Bhaspa
 inamen kisi ko jeet to nahin mili par afazaal ko jahaan ek 1
 63 lakhs i
e
 17
 40 pratishat vot mili vahiin om prakaash rajbhar ko takreeban 68 hazaar vot mili
 Something similar was seen in other seats
 ek choti party ke milane se rajbhar ke voton kii is nai takat par bijepi kii nigaah thi
 Therefore, in the 2017 Assembly elections with Om Prakash Rajbhar, the BJP compromised and they did not give as many seats as they wanted, yet the BJP gave 8 seats
 jinamein 4 siton par inhen jeet mili
 With this victory, Suhail Dev opened the account of Bharatiya Samaj Party in the assembly for the first time and Om Prakash also became a cabinet minister
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaasapa se samjhaute kaa parinaam bhi dikhaa ki soobe main bijepi ne ab tak ke kshetreey partiyon ke kshatrapon sapa-basapa kaa lagbhag safaya kar diya
 In this victory, Om Prakash Rajbhar felt that the victory of BJP in the seats of the state including Purvanchal is punished due to his fraternity
 ye baat isse bhi samajhi ja sakati he ki unhone naaraaz hokar is baar unheen 39 siton par apane ummidavaar khadey bhi kiye hai jin siton par wo bijepi se loksabhaa kaa tikat maang rahe the
 Ever since he became a minister in the BJP government of the state, Om Prakash Rajbhar started preparing for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and started a politics of pressure to take maximum seats from the BJP
 jisase unke or sarkaar ke bich khinchataan shuru ho gai
 Due to this tussle, the BJP sensed his intention and started preparing his Rajbhar to deal with it
 bijepi ne varanasi ke shivpur vidhansabha seat se anil rajbhar ko tikat diya or chunaav jitne ke baad pradesh main mantri bana kar takat bhi di
 Anil Rajbhar also tried his best to connect his fraternity with the BJP and also organized a rally in several districts to realize the strength
 lekin in sab par om prakaash rajbhar counter atake main baari padate nazar aaye
 Om Prakash Rajbhar also accused the BJP of betraying him
 ek taraf wo birdari ko todane ke liye anil rajbhar ko saport kar rahi he to duusari taraf unki takat kaam karne ke liye unka koi kaam nahin kar rahi he
 Even the DM of his area does not agree with him
 iske liye apane hi sarkaar ke khilaaf om prakaash rajbhar ne baqayada anshan par bhi baithne kii dhamkee di thi halanki baad main unhen manaa liya gaya
 In the ongoing wrestling between the BJP and Om Prakash Rajbhar, when the BJP began to feel weak, it resorted to diplomacy
 2019 ke chunaav main usne ek baar phir samjhaute kii baat rakhi
 This time, Om Prakash Rajbhar offered his fraternity leaders of 2 Lok Sabha seats to make him the chairman and vice-chairman in various commissions
 bijepi ne aayogon main unke logon ko adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh banane ke baat maan lee or takreeban 9 logon kii puri list ko unhone ayog main edjust kar diya
 After this Rajbhar calmed down a bit
 unki apni birdari main bhi bijepi kii paith hone lagi
 But there was still a climax of the game
 loksabhaa ke chunaav main bijepi ne jitne tikat om prakaash maang rahe the, use dene se inkaar kar diya or ek seat ghosi kii jo unako de bhi rahi thi to is shart par ki wo khud is seat par bijepi ke chunaav se hi lade
 This was a slow but loud blow to bjp's Om Prakash Rajbhar
 is chaal kii wo ummid bhi nahin lagaaye the
 What was it then, he got angry and immediately announced that his party would fight and fight separately from the BJP in this election
 apni birdari ko apni taraf rokane ke liye ye elaan bhi kiya ki unke liye saansad bananaa mahatvapurn nahin he, mahatwapurna he apni birdari ke adhikaar ke liye ladanaa
 Om Prakash Rajbhar, who started his journey from a tempo cunning to a minister, formed his party in the year 2002 and has brought the party to this position by adding his fraternity to this rebel
 ab wo ek baar phir apni party ke astitv ke liye bijepi se do-do haath karne ke liye maidan main hai
 In such a situation, it is to be seen that his fraternity stands with or with the bjp's Rajbhar
 bharat dharmik aasthaaon vaala desh he

The Trinamool Congress said that the Congress was ignoring it and playing with fire
 party ne kaha ki lokapal vidheyak main lokayuktaon ke gathan vaale praavdhaan par vah centre sarkaar ke saath samjhauta nahin karegi kyonki yah praavdhaan rajyon kii aazaadee par kutharaghaat karata he
 Trinamool Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Shekhar Roy said, "if i am not mistaken, we have introduced 137 amendments and all these amendments are related to the draft constitution of Lokayuktas present in the Lokpal Bill
" 'unhone kaha, 'sarkaar ko sabhi sanshodhano par sahamat hona hoga anyathaa lokapal vidheyak par ham sarkaar ke saath nahin honge
 "roy said," This provision of the Lokpal Bill strikes the independence of the states, which we cannot allow

 Roy said, "congress is playing with fire and if such things continue, they will have to bear the consequences

 He said that a few days ago BJP leaders were releasing booklets on corruption of Mayawati government and now their own party is embracing tainted former ministers

 It is said that half the script of bjp's defeat in Gorakhpur was written on the same day when Upendra Dutt Shukla was made a candidate from there
 upendra shukla agar jitate to ye bijepi, modi or yogi kii jeet se zyada gorakhpur ke math kii haar hoti
 In this defeat of BJP in Gorakhpur, 'math' has also hidden its victory
 gorakhpur kii siyasat ko kareeb se jaanane vaale is baat ko acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki yahaan kii siyasat brahman banaam thakur kii chalati aa rahi he
 This fight is not today
 dashakon pehle ye ladaai shuru hui thi, jo aaj bhi jari he
 It is said that at that time the Mahant of Gorakhnath Temple used to be Digvijay Nath
 gorakhpur ke brahmanon ke bich pan
 Surtinarayan Tripathi was very distinguished
 kisi vajah se diggivaj nath ne suratinarayan treepathi kaa apmaan kiya tha
 At the same time, the mathematics of Kshatriya vs Brahman started
 iske baad us vakt ke yuva netaa harishankar tiwari ne digvijay nath ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai
 Later, the leadership of the Thakurs came to Virendra Shahi, but between Harishankar Tiwari's 'hata' and Avaidyanath's 'math' the battle of supremacy in Gorakhpur continued
 90 ke dashak main yogi adityanath ke haath math kii kaman ai
 The yogi increased the strength of 'math'
 unki hindu yuva vahini aasapaas ke kai jilon main sakriy hui
 Meanwhile, in the year 1998, Mafia don Sriprakash Shukla was confronted, which was called Brahmin Kshatrap
 gorakhpur main brahmanon or rajputon ke baraabar vot hai, lekin yogi adityanath kii takat lagaataar badi, brahman netritv kamjor hota gaya
 With this, the effect of 'hata' started diminishing
 us vakt shivapratap shukla brahmanon ke sarvamaanya or taqatvar netaa the
 But with the increasing power of Yogi, his political downfall continued
 haalat to ye hui ki kuch varshon ke liye shivapratap shukla raajnneetik patal se hi ojhal ho gaye
 Meanwhile, from the state to the center, Yogi Adityanath's political stature continued to grow
 modi-shah yug se pehle alam ye tha ki purvanchal main ek vakt main maamla yogi banaam bijepi ho gaya tha
 Whomever he wanted would get a ticket, whomever he did not want, he would have lost it
 majabuuran bijepi ko unke aage ghutane techne padate
 They had to accept everything
 yogi kii banaai hindu yuva vahini isamen sabase mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati thi
 In the 2017 assembly elections, BJP got an absolute majority
 mukhyamantri ke liye kai naam saamne aae
 Manoj Sinha was named till the final
 lekin aisa mana jaataa he ki aresas ke samarthan se yogi adityanath mukhyamantri banane main safal rahe
 The biggest resentment was in Brahmins in UP as soon as he became Chief Minister
 yah baat kendriya netritv tak pahunchi
 After this, Modi and Shah made several efforts for damage control, including making Mahendra Pandey the President of UP BJP
 bijepi netritv purvanchal main thakur banaam brahman se bhalee bhaanti parichit ho chukaa tha
 Therefore, there was a search for a Brahmin face to give tickets to Yogi's seat, so that balance could be made here
 bijepi sanghathan or aresas kii raay se gorakhpur upachunaav ke liye upendra dutt shukla modi or amit shah kii pehali pasand bane
 But sources say that Yogi Adityanath did not want Gorakhpur's leadership to go to the Brahmins
 yogi ke saamne apni seat bachaane se zyada ahm tha gorakhpur main apane 'math' kii takat ko bachaana
 Despite this, Upendra Dutt Shukla was declared a candidate from Gorakhpur parliamentary constituency
 chunki aadesh amit shah kaa tha, to iske sidhe virodh main jane kii himmat kisi main nahin thi
 But a period of internal intrigues and intrigues started
 bataur siem yogi ne jamkar prachaar kiya, lekin yogi ke log niskriy ho gaye
 Everyone knows that in Purvanchal, BJP means Yogi and Yogi means organization
 aise main kisi bhi ummidavaar ke liye unki marji ke bina jeet hasil karnaa tedi kheer he
 This time it was alam that even BJP agents were not present at the booth
 iske ulat sapa or basapa ke samarthak josh se lage hue the, jiskaa parinaam sabake saamne he

 britaini spiryas kaa kahana he, 'mujhe bachapan se hi smurfs bahut pasand the or ab mere bete smurfs ke jabardast fain hai
 i wanted to surprise him through the song in the film
 'soni pikchars ke world wide mujic kii president liya volac kahati hai, 'da smurfs ke saath britaini ko jodakar ham kaaphi romanchit hai
 He is a tremendous artist and his son is a fan of Smurfs, it was a perfect fit for all of us
 'film ke diarector raja gosanel kehete hai, 'main is baat se kaaphi utsahit hum ki britaini smarf adventure team kaa hissaa ban rahi hai
 Ooh La La Smurf is the perfect song for the party
 ' britaini is nae andaaj main dekhen kitni hit hoti hai
 For the past few months, Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been in awe
 unki sena altitii se bees sabit ho rahi he
 Attempts to defeat the government in Parliament have been thwarted by the President and he has gone one step ahead of his rivals by declaring a package of transfer of power for Tamils
 colombo main apane temple tries offis main managing editor raaj chengappa se vishesh baatcheet main rajpakshe ne apni bhavi chunautiyon kaa khulaasa kiya
 Excerpts: Do you want to catch Prabhakaran alive or dead? Alive
 usne jo aparaadh kiye hai, uske liye us par mukadmaa chalaane kii jarurat he
 i would also like to send him to India because there he killed a leader who would have changed the picture of not only India but the whole region
 aapane sarkaar or altitii ke bich paanch saal puraane sangharsh viraam samajhaite ko samaapt karne kaa faisla kyon kiya?2002 main jab yah samajhaita lagu kiya gaya tha, main vipaksh kaa netaa tha or iske khilaaf aawaaj uthaane vaala pehla vyakti tha
 When i became President, i said that i will try to negotiate with the LTTE, and try to settle the issue and make peace
 lekin iskaa arth yah nahin tha ki maine sangharsh viraam samajhaite ko sweekaar kar liya tha
 But they started killing, not only attacking our army commander and defense secretary, who is my brother, but also started targeting civilians and children
 main hatyaein rokna chahta tha
 They had violated the ceasefire agreement so many times that it had become a joke
 isliye maine ise khatm karne kaa faisla kiya
 Now, what is the basis of your confidence in waging a fight for the LTTE annihilation? Either they will lay down their arms and accept a political solution or we will have to curb their activities
 sarkaar aatankwaadiyon ke aage ghutane nahin tech sakati
 Since we came to power, we have freed the eastern and western provinces from LTTE control
 ab ve sirf dedh jile tak simit rah gaye hai
 Government is committed from top to bottom
 sarkaar or suraksha balon main ab zyada talmail he, jisase hamaara kaam aasaan ho gaya he
 Will you talk if the LTTE comes forward for talks again? Yes, but only when they lay down their arms
 chit bhi unki or pat bhi unki nahin ho sakati
 The ceasefire will give them a chance to recover again
 ham nahin chaahate ki ve phir se majboot ho jaaen or ham par hamale karen
 We want a permanent solution
 agar altitii baatcheet ke liye nahin aata, to unka safaya karne main kitna samay lagegaa?ham bache-khuche ilaakon se unka safaya kaaphi pehle hi kar lete, lekin hamen yah dekhnaa tha ki isamen naagarik na maare jaaen
 In a year and a half, we will be able to eliminate them
 lagata he ki altitii kii javaabi ranneeti nagarikon ko nishaanaa banane kii he?yah ek hataasha bharaa kadam he, is ummid main ki isse vishwa samudaay sarkaar par dabaav daalega
 But they are not going to achieve anything
 mahangaai kaaphi badi he
 Do you think people are willing to bear the cost of war? People must understand
 haal main ek pratidwandvi akhbaar dwaara karaae gaye surveykshan main bataaya gaya he ki log mere vikaas kaaryon kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 There will be no cut in the defense budget
 ham raksha par jo kharch kar rahe hai, vah bahut zyada nahin he
 3 of this GDP
 5 pratishat he
 i believe that no country can compromise on defense
 2005 main raashtrapati pad sambhalate samay aapane kaha tha ki aapako apeksha he ki bharat kaaphi kuch karegaa
 Has India met your expectations? India's attitude has been very positive and encouraging
 hamaare sambandh ab sambhawatah sarvshereshth str par hai
 But India is not ready to sell you weapons to fight LTTE
 hathiyaar ham kahin se bhi kharid sakate hai, lekin ham ek acha mitra nahin kharid sakate
 And that's what we need
 bharat is kshetra main ek badi takat he
 He is very strong and can do a lot for the development of his neighboring countries
 sirf srilanka hi nahin balki baaki deshon ke liye bhi
 India is with us and has expressed its support to us
 europea sangh or anya deshon ne yuddh ke dauraan aapaki sarkaar dwaara maanavadhikaron ke ulanghan kaa aarope lagaaya he
 There are some allegations about the eastern region
 hamane in saare aaropon kii jaanch karai he lekin koi bhi shikaayat karne ke liye aage nahin aayaa he, jisase karrwai shuru kii ja sake
 We have formed a commission of eminent people to investigate these allegations, but we need complaint, evidence and witnesses to do justice in such cases
 ham karrwai karenge
 Talking about political solutions, APRC has recommended to implement the 13th Constitutional Amendment of 1987 on the package for Tamil problems
 tamil log us samaadhaan ke liye kyon raji honge, jiskaa prastaav unhen 20 saal pehle kiya gaya tha?unhen kyon nahin raji hona chahie? ise isliye kabhi bhi lagu nahin kiya ja sakaa tha, kyonki is par sahamat hone vaale donon paksh-altitii or sarkaar-iske turant baad hi palat gaye
 i believe this is a good way to start
 hamen pehle shuruyaat aisi cheez se kerani hogi, jise ham lagu kar sakate hon
 i do not need a two-thirds majority in Parliament for that
 lihaaja, yah ek shuruyaat he
 APRC can give us new proposals and we can consider them as well
 lekin main sirf vishwa samudaay ko santusht karne ke liye un samaadhaanon main apana samay kharch nahin karnaa chahta jo vyaavhaarik nahin hai
 Such solutions may look good on paper, but will be burned in Parliament
 unase dange fail jaaenge
 According to you how fast can the package be implemented? i have already appointed the Cabinet Advisory Committee
 main unki report kaa intjaar kar rahaa hum
 As soon as i get the report, i will implement it
 aap kah chuke hai ki aap tamilon ko 13wein samvidhan sanshodhan se zyada denge?main un prastaavon kii pratiksha kar rahaa hum, jin par faisla samiti ko karnaa he
 Till then, we can implement something that has been supported by everyone - the then government, the LTTE and the rest of the Tamil parties - which Rajiv Gandhi helped achieve in 1987 under the india-sri Lanka agreement
 iske alaava main tamil bhashaa seekhney or prashasan main uske istemaal kii sarkari bhashaa niti ko lagu karne ke kadam pehle hi uthaa chukaa hum
 i am also recruiting Tamils in the police force
 aisa mat sochie ki ham sirf aatankwaadiyon se lard rahe hai
 Is the consensus of Sinhalese parties with you in their implementation? How can the UNP oppose it when its government passed the 13th Constitutional Amendment
 sirf jevipi (janata vimukti peramuna) samasya he
 But we should not forget that the JVP has demanded even more rights for the provinces and has participated in the provincial councils
 aap mukt karaae ja chuke purvi jilon main janamat sangrah kyon nahin karaate ki kya ve samajhaite ke mutabik uttar main shaamil hone ke liye taiyaar hai?main kyon karaun? agar aap batticaloa jaise sthanon par jaaen, to aap paaenge ki ve iskaa virodh karte hai
 i will not let the country break
 bharat jaisaa sangheey dhaancha kyon nahin?sangheey vyavastha beeti baat ho chuki he
 Do not talk about it
 aitihaasik taur par yah shabd sandigdh he or ise algaavvaad se jod kar dekha jaataa he
 i have got the mandate of maximum decentralization under a unitary government, and i am implementing it
 aapaki party kii sansad main do tihaai bahumat praapt nahin he
 Will you hold an election to implement it? i do not need a two-thirds majority to implement what has been proposed
 jarurat hogi to nishchit chunaav karaungaa

 ’ dhoni is baat se sahamat hai ki twanti20 match main log 80 ran yaa 100 ran ke aasapaas kaa score dekhne nahin aate
 He said, 'you know that people like T20 for sixes and fours
 saath hi aap nahin chaahate ki 80 yaa 100 ran ke aasapaas kaa score bane
 The low-scoring match should be 130–135 runs, while the higher-scoring matches can be between 200 and 240 runs
 ek tarah se yah (84 ran kaa peechha karnaa) hamaare liye acha he kyonki ham aisi team he jo aakraamak cricket khelti he
 'kohli has consistently done well
 Dhoni expressed happiness that Virat Kohli is constantly taking additional responsibility under pressure conditions but he refused to comment on whether this Delhi batsman is India's best batsman so far in difficult times
 is
 unhone kaha, ‘aakhir aisa kyon hota he ki ham hameshaa tulana karte hai
 Other players have also performed and i do not believe compared to individual players
 maine paanch saal se adhik samay tak captaini kii he or main nahin bataa saktaa ki prayek khilaadi kitne dabaav main hota he
 He (kohli) has done consistently well for us and is ready to take additional responsibility
 ’ dhoni ne yuvaraj singh bhi jujharu pari kii bhi tarif kii or unka mana he ki ran se adhik mahatvapurn yah he ki unhone kitni gend kaa saamana kiya
 The captain said, 'things were difficult
 aapako ise hameshaa dhyaan main rakhana hota he
 There is pressure to lose wickets while batting in the lower order
 aap jitna nichle kram main jaaoge dabaav badhata jayega
 For me, how many runs Yuvraj scored was more important than how many balls he faced
 vah kuch maukon par chook rahaa tha lekin usne shot khilne kii koshish kii
 This will give him a lot of confidence
 ummid karata hum ki vah behatar halaat main achche shot khel paaegaa
 Dhoni also admitted that chasing the target of 84 runs on this pitch was also not easy

 gujarat main patidaar andolan ke pramukh chehre ke taur par ubhare hardik patel kya 17 janvari ko udaipur se reeha hote hi phir se giraftaar honge
 Following the action taken by the Rajasthan Police on Saturday, such things are picking up
 aisi bhi ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki hardik patel ke julul or himmatnagar kii raily ko rokane ke liye bhi aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 Hardik Patel has been summoned by the Delvada police of Rajsamand for investigation in an old case
 20 july ko hardik patel jab nathdwara se apana janmdin manaa kar udaipur laut rahe the tab delwada ke toll naake par unke or unke samarthakon dwaara toll nahin chukaane kaa maamla delvada thane main darj hua tha
 The Dilwada police released Hardik Patel and 11 of his supporters on this issue after questioning
 magar hardik patel kii rihaai se thik pehle us maamle memrajasthan pulicene ek baar phir se hardik ko talab kiya tha
 During this, Hardik Patel along with his supporters reached the Delwada police station where he was questioned again by the Delwada police station in-charge
 kareeb 1 ghante kii poochtacha ke baad police ne hardik patel or unke samarthako se bayaan lekar chhod diya
 Speaking on the occasion, Hardik made it clear that he has full faith in the law and has fully cooperated with the police
 ve khud se kiye gaye sawaalon kaa jawaab de chuke hai
 According to Hardik's saying, the currents on them have been applied at the behest of someone
 ve khud ko bekasoor bataate hai
 Hardik attacked the BJP on this occasion and said that they are using jail and pressure to scare people
 taaki log dar kar ghar main baith jaayen
 Special conversation from Aaj Tak Hardik Patel said in a conversation with Aaj Tak that it was a July 20 case on which summons has been sent by the police
 maine yahaan aakar apana bayaan darj karavaaya he
 It is nice to help with whatever the law processes
 ve kanoon or nyaay par vishwaas rakhte hai
 They say that any person in the country imposes any current at the behest of anyone
 lekin unhone koi gunaah nahin kiya he
 He left the entire matter to the court
 yah maamla 6 maheene pehle kaa he
 Significantly, Hardik Patel has been in Udaipur for the last several months, but the police never considered the need for questioning
 ab jab ki ve ghar vaapasi karne vaale hai
 In such a situation, this type of action is being viewed with suspicion
 hardik patel isse pehle police par amit shah ke ishaare par pratadit karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha

 mamata banerjee or mukul roy kya algaav ke kagaar par hai? pashchim bengal kii isi charchit siyaasi jodi ne 2011 main suniyojit vyuh rachana ke bal par vampanthi satta ko ukhaad phenkaa tha
 "if Mamata is the heart of Trinamool Congress, then Roy's mind," says a Trinamool Congress leader
 aisa lagata he ki dil or dimag alag ho rahe hai
 "roy was in the role of Sankatmochan and political advisor, closest to Mamta for many years
 par ab unka varchasv dhoomil pad rahaa he
 The latest setback came during the presidential election when six of the party's mlas voted in favor of nda's Ramnath Kovind, went to the BJP camp and disregarded the party in the vice-presidential election by a dozen mps
 Supervisor removed from post
 roy ne bhaajapa main shaamil hone ke daavon ko khaarij kiya he, par kendriya mantri arun jetali ke ghar unka baar-baar janaa kuch or hi ishaara kar rahaa he
 Right now, Mamta is finding a way to rescue
 uparashtrapati chunaav ke baad unhone roy ko rakshabandhan par aamantrit kiya to roy ne bhi kalai par didi kii raakhi sajaakar party ke prati vafadari jataai
 Two days later, on 9 August, Roy shared the stage with Mamta in Midnapore from where Didi played the bugle of "BJP Quit India Movement"
 yah 21 july kii shahid diwas kii raily se ulat tha jahaan roy manch par pichhali qatari main baithe the
 Says a party MP, "after about a month it has been proved that Roy is essential to the party, as evident from the presidential election
" "mamata ne congress se alag hone ke baad 1998 main trinmul congress kaa gathan kiya jiske kaamkaaj ke liye ve roy par 2015 tak nirbhar raheen
 If the party's rule over the power of Bengal laid the foundation for the magnetic attraction of Mamta's rallies, then Mukul put his life into converting this mass into votes
 party ke ek saansad kehete hai, ''roy na sirf har block, panchayat or jila ke party sadasyon se parichit hai, balki unhone unke saath sampark barkaraar rakhane main bhi vakt diya he
 "roy was also given the rights to raise money, transfer / reinstatement of police officers in the interest of the party, and to seat favored people in administrative posts

 D
 singh jaise dhanadhy logon ko shaamil karnaa bhi roy kaa hi vichaar tha
 According to a party leader, "roy had a good relationship with Saradha Group chief Sudipta Sen
 " faraar hone se pehle sen der raat roy ke nivas par mili the or donon us vakt tak sampark main the, jab tak april 2013 main sharada pramukh ko sonmarg (kashmir) main pakad nahin liya gaya
 The first rift in Roy's relationship with Mamta occurred in early 2015
 31 janvari 2015 ko sharada chit fund ghotaale ke sambandh main paanch ghante tak sibiai ke sawaalon kaa saamana karne ke baad baahar aae roy ne sibiai main bharosa jataayaa
 His statement was contrary to Mamata's accusation of using the CBI against political rivals of the NDA government
 dilachasp he ki kolkata main roy ke sibiai karyaalay jane ke pehle mamata ne dhamkee di thi ki agar unke sipahasaalar ko koi nuksaan pahunchaa to ve sadak par utar jaaengi
 It is said that Mamta immediately called Roy to get the details after the CBI inquiry
 par roy ne ''baad main phone karuunga" kah kar baat nahin kii or baad main bhi phone nahin kiya
 As a result, he was removed not only from the post of All India General Secretary of the party, but also from the post of Secretary of the Executive Committee and leader of the party in Rajya Sabha
 mamata ke tarkash kaa sabase ahm tir hone ke kaaran roy party ke kai netaaon sahit mamata ke bhattije abhishek banerjee kii bhi aankh kaa kanta the
 When Roy disregarded senior leader Suvendu Adhikari and made his newborn son Shubhranshu the chairman of the party's youth unit, he was accused of nepotism
 roy ne apane vishwaasapatro ko vidhansabha or loksabhaa ke tikat dekar unhen jeetne main madad kerani shuru kii to party main ubharate samaantar satta sameekaran se mamata ke kaan khadey hue
 Says Vishwanath Chakraborty, professor of political science at Kolkata's Ravindra Bharti University, "mamta will not tolerate any other center of power and a challenge
" 2001 main mamata ke saath matbhed ke kaaran ajit panja ko party chhodmai padi thi
 During the last NDA government, when party MP Sudeep Bandopadhyay started becoming popular in national politics and his closeness with LK Advani increased, Mamata gave him the edge
 " rajya ke urja mantri sowndev chattopadhyaay bhi is baat kii tasdik karte hai, ''mamata ke liye koi bhi vyakti aprihaary nahin, chaahe ve roy hon yaa phir koi or
 She gives directions and we follow them
 yah acchhee baat he ki party kii loktantric vyavastha main mamata jaisi ek majboot shaasha hai jo party or iske netaaon kii door apane haath main rakhti hai
 "during the year 2015-16, Roy was marginalized within a year of Mamta's falling out of sight
 unke samarthak maukey kii najaakat ko dekhte hue mamata ke prati nishthavan ho gaye the
 When Mamta also welcomed him by giving him big responsibilities, then they also accepted the suzerainty of Mamta
 tab yah bhi atakalein thim ki roy party kaa vibhaajan kara sakate hai
 In 2015, the Nationalist Trinamool Congress Party was also formed, but Roy thought it better to stay behind the scenes, leading his colleague Amitabh Majumdar as the founding president of this newly appointed party
 2016 main mamata ne akele apane boote party ko duusari baar rajya kii satta par kabiz kiya or is tarah roy kaa prabhaav or bhi kam ho gaya
 Sobhanlal Dutt Gupta, a professor at the University of Calcutta, says, "as Mamata is presenting Abhishek as her succession, it is difficult for Roy to regain his old position in the party
" roy kaa rajyasabha kaa kaarykaal april 2018 main khatm ho rahaa he or lagata nahin ki unhen dobaaraa namit kiya jayega
 "so will the BJP be an option for Roy? The BJP is eagerly looking for a strong local face in the state
 aise main roy bhaajapa kii pasand ho sakate hai
 But the question is, will Roy be able to compete with Mamata's popularity and aura? mobile ap whotsap par gomance se judi aapattijanak tippaniyan kathith rup se bhejne ke maamle main jharkhand main giraftaar kiye gaye yuvak kii ravivaar ko police hiraasat main maut ho gai

 Former Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is struggling with bad form these days
 isaki taaja misaal he ki vah apane sabase pasandida maidan vishakhapattan main bhivesteindike khilaaf badi pari khilne main naakaam rahe
 Dhoni scored just 20 runs in this match and Obed was bowled by mccoy
 dhoni ke is pradarshan se aam cricket phens ke alaava khaas phens bhi niraash hai
 Babul Supriyo, a minister in the Modi government at the center, has even been upset with Dhoni's batting and advised him to retire
 haalanki supriyo ne khud ko dhoni kaa sabase bada fain bataaya he phir bhi unka kahana he ki jis tareeke se wo aaj out hue aisa katai sweekaarya nahin he
 Cannot accept the manner in which Dhoni got out today! Inspite of being one of his Biggest Fans, i dread the thought that surfaces in the corners of my mind that maybe, maybe he should play his own judgment to decide if it's time for him to say 'goodbye'
 
 ur welcome to disagree😀 — Babul Supriyo (@supriyobabul) October 24, 2018 Babul Supriyo tweeted, 'the way Dhoni is out today, it is not acceptable
 unka bada fain hone ke baavjood mere dimag ke kisi hisse main ye khyaal aata he ki unhen ab apane bare main khud jaj kar yah tay karnaa chahie ki kya ab gudby kehane kaa samay aa gaya he
 You are welcome to disagree with me
 ' haalanki babul ke is twit par yugers ne milijuli pratikriya di he
 Some felt that this suggestion was correct and many believed that Dhoni is still a better option for ODI cricket
 bataa den ki dhoni ke liye vishakhapattan kaa ye maidan kaaphi lucky rahaa he
 Dhoni made his career debut against Bangladesh, but he got recognition from the match played against Pakistan in this same ground in 2005, in which he came off the third order and scored 148 runs off 123 balls
 bhartiya team ne yah match jeeta or dhoni ne phir peeche mud kar nahin dekha
 a thrilling match in the second match of the Tieseries required the West Indies to score 5 runs on the last ball to win and their batsman Shai Hope tied the match with a four off that ball
 is match main toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne utari team india ne 50 over main 6 wicket ganvaa kar 321 ran banaae or westeindies ko jeet ke liye 322 ranon kaa target diya
 The West Indies team also scored 321 runs losing 7 wickets in 50 overs and the match was tied
 viraat kohli kii captaini main bharat kaa yah pehla taai match he
 In this match, Kohli smashed an unbeaten 157 not out, scoring 37th ODI century, for which he has been adjudged 'man of the Match'

 As a result, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, while addressing a joint session of Parliament on the afternoon of 28 February, announced that the pilot Abhinandan would be released on Friday

 He said that this step is important in the direction of peace

 However, the Geneva Treaty comes into force when the two countries declare war between themselves
 jabaki abhi tak bharat or pakistan ne jang kii ghoshnaa nahin kii he
 In such a situation, experts say that the release of Abhinandan cannot be said under the Geneva Treaty, because both countries are not in war

 Despite the strict instructions of the Supreme Court, once again Delhi's air has become poisonous and questions are being raised on the ruling BJP in the surrounding states and center whether air pollution is its priority or not? BJP has been in government for the last three-and-a-half years, while in the neighboring state of Haryana, the BJP government has been around three years
