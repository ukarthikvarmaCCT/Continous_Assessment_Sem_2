 amarnath yatriyon par hamale ko lekar pakistan ne khamoshi akhtiryar kii hui he
 Terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba has also not claimed responsibility for the attack
 magar hamale kii saazish ke taar pakistan se pukhta taur par jude dikh rahe hai
 In fact, a week earlier, Abdul Rahman Makki, brother-in-law of Hafiz Saeed, a terrorist sitting in Pakistan, had given a threat
 pakistan ke bahawalpur serhaman makkine aatanki burhan vaani kii barsi manaane or is dauraan bharat main aatanki hamale kii chetavanee di thi
 Makki also mentioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Israel in his statement
 'modi ko isroyal daure kii sajaa'rahamaan makki ne apane nafrat bhare bol bharat ko todane tak kii baat kahi thi
 Not only this, he also said in his message that Modi's visit to Israel is a revenge
 darasal, bharat kii aazaadee ke baad desh ke kisi pradhanmantri ne isroyal kaa daura kiya he
 Pakistan was watching the PM Modi's visit to Israel very closely
 pakistani media bhi lagaataar modi ke daure ko lekar khabaren chalaa rahi thim
 In the media there, there was concern about India's strengthening relations with Israel
 bharat or isroyal ke bicharaksha saudon ko lekar pakistanmen vimarsh dekhne ko mila he
 Some experts even went on to say that increasing defense cooperation between India and Israel would disturb the strategic balance in the South Asian region
 darasal, sawaal sirf itnaa hi nahin, pakistan kii chintaa isse aage kii he
 India is constantly increasing its combat weapons
 kashmir main bhartiya sena or surakshabal aatankiyon ke khilaaf abhiyaan chede hue hai
 In such a situation, Pakistan has been intimidated by getting a befitting reply from India on the border
 balki pakistani army ke paale gaye aatankiyon ke aakaa bhi bharat kii badhati takat se chintit hai
 Therefore, it is believed that desperate terrorists targeted Amarnath Yatris due to growing friendship between PM Modi and Israel
 vahiin rahamaan makki kaa nafrat bharaa bayaan isliye bhi zyada myne rakhata he kyonki hafiz said kii nazarbandi ke baad se rahamaan makki hi lashkar-e taiyaba or jamaat-ud daawa kii aatankwaadi gatividhiyon ko dekh rahaa he

 We must learn our lessons from history and fight to safeguard the democratic institutions in the country — Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial) June 25, 2019 The fight between Modi versus Mamata has been a rift in the past five years between the Modi government and Mamata Banerjee
 mamata banerjee ne bhi puure aakraamak tareeke se bhaajapa par hamalaa kiya
 Be it CBI, Lok Sabha elections or Panchayat elections

 donon dalon ke kaaryakarta hinsa par utre hue hai, kai kaaryakartaaon kii hatya kar di gai
 The situation in the state has become uncontrollable with respect to Jai Shri Ram
 loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko bengal main kaaphi phayda hua he, bijepi ko kul 18 or tiemasi ko kul 22 siten mili hai

 In the Somalia capital on Wednesday, the number of people killed in two car explosions outside a hotel has increased to 11
 vahiin, darjanon anya log ghayal hue hai
 This information is given in police and media reports
 samachar agency sinhua ne police adhikari usoof hair ke hawaale se kaha, ham isaki pushti kar sakate hai ki mritkon kii sankhya 11 ho gai he
 These include four government soldiers and five civilians
 yah visphot mogadishu ke hawaondde ke kareeb sthit jajira hotel ke baahar visphotak saamagree se ladi do kaaron main hue
 This hotel is frequented by government officials and local businessmen
 sthaneey media ne kaha ki hotel ko nishaanaa banaakar kiye gaye visphot main 10 log maare gaye or darjanon log ghayal hue hai
 Somalia's Prime Minister Abdivali Sheikh Ahmed has condemned the attack
 unhone twit kiya, aatankwaadiyon ne varsh 2014 kii shuruyaat 2013 ke ant kii hinsak vaardaaton or hatyaon kii tarah hi kii he
 Will work to unite Somalia against them
 bibisi ne bataaya ki report ke mutabik, visphot surakshabalon or hamalaavaron main hui muthbhed ke falswaroop hue hai
 The Somalian terrorist group Al Shabaab, ousted from Mogadishu in 2011, claimed responsibility for the attack
 aazaadee ke baad congress ko is baat kaa gaurav praapt tha ki sabhi dharmon or sampradaayon ke log uske saath the
 He also cashed it heavily in elections
 kaaphi varshon tak aisa rahaa lekin dhire-dhire is vyavastha par duusari partiyon kii nazar pad gai or congress kaa bahut bada janaadhar khisakta chalaa gaya
 By the 90s, the Dalits were completely separated from the Congress
 na uske paas kaddavar dalit netaa the or na hi dalit vot bank
 Mayawati emerged as the eldest leader of the Dalits and defeated her vote bank
 iskaa hi nateeja rahaa ki unhen upi main jabardast kamyaabi mili
 Strongly opposing the forward castes, she made her place among the Dalits and became a contender for the post of Chief Minister
 bijepi ke saath milakar vah uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ke pad par kabiz bhi huin
 But over time she understood one thing that she could not remain in power by opposing forward castes
 so unhone soshal engeering kaa sahaara liya or brahmanon ko apane saath le liya
 This was a revolutionary step and people looked at him with great surprise
 iske parinaam chunaav main saaf dikhe
 Mayawati won Uttar Pradesh
 yah tha soshal ejineering kaa kamaal
 Time has changed
 bijepi ke kheme se ab ram mandir kii gunj nahin sunai padati
 The party understood that it could do something by creating a new equation
 isi kadi main usne bhi ek nae tarah ke soshal ejineering kaa sahaara lenaa shuru kiya
 He first joined the RPI (athawale) in Maharashtra, which describes itself as a sympathy party for Dalits
 baba sahab ambedkar kii vichaar dhara se prabhavit is party ke kai tukade ho chuke hai phir bhi kuch poketon main iskaa acha prabhaav he
 But now Ram Vilas Paswan's ljp's intention to join him has found him a partner in Bihar
 paswan kii party bhale hi pichley chunaav main kuch khaas nahin kar pai lekin yah sach he ki uske samarthakon kii taadaad kaaphi he
 It may not be able to turn into a vote bank on its own, but it can leave an impact on many seats in association with a party like BJP
 paswan ke baad ab dalit netaa or purv beurocret udit raaj bhi bijepi main chale aae hai
 He certainly does not have much power in the politics of votes, but he suits the party as a symbol
 bijepi ne is baar soshal engeering kii ek koshish kii he
 It wants to make a dent in the vote bank of the Congress and also send a message to the supporters of parties like Bahujan Samaj Party
 uski manshaa he ki desh kii is badi aabaadi ko saath lekar chalaa jaae kyonki laal kile par jhanda fahraane ke liye unke sahare kii jarurat padegi
 Three people died and at least 50 are said to be missing due to heavy rains and landslides in China's Yunnan province

 ' Although the CBI has filed a charge sheet in the Ishrat Jahan case, the charges have not yet been decided
 is par grih mantralay ne sibiai ko ibi ke rajinder kumaar or baaqi afasaron ke kilaaf maamla darj karne kii ijazat bhi nahin di thi kyonki unke kilaaf mantralay ko sibiai dwaara ikattha kiye saboot naakaafi lage the

 Regarding that wall, the saint says that perhaps the entire length of 23 km of the canal is ending there

 There is no water in the canal due to the off season, but the arrangements here clearly indicate that all the water coming into the canal is only for the saint's farm

 First Chief Minister Mayawati sent letters seeking reservation to the Prime Minister, then the leaders of the angry Congress started a counter attack to build their base in the state

 In the case of about one and a half year old, suddenly the intention of the Union Rural Development Minister to write a letter to the Chief Minister of the state is evident

 In response to Jairam's 'apolitical letter', Mayawati also sent a letter to the Prime Minister, saying that the minister lacked financial rights under the federal system in the Indian Constitution

 Meanwhile, Jairam wrote a letter to the State Rural Development Minister, Daddu Prasad, advising the CBI to investigate the scam so that people feel that the government is serious about fighting corruption

 The more the alliance with the BSP grows, the better it will be for the Congress

 ' When the sessions court of Mumbai sentenced Salman Khan for 5 years on Wednesday, the beating of crores of fans, including the family of 'dabangg', intensified
 khabar ai ki salmaan ko court se sidhe arthur road jail le jaaya jayega
 But then in this real life scene of the court, senior lawyer Harish Salve is entered and Salman gets the bail after just a few hours
 buudhvaar ko internet par jitani charchasalmanaki thi, utani hi harish salve kii bhi
 56-year-old Salve emerged as the 'superhero' of a reel life hero
 salve ne hai court main tark diya ki order kii copy nahin milane ke kaaran salmaan ko jail bheja janaa sahi nahin he
 Taking this argument of senior counsel as true, the High Court granted Abhineta two days' advance bail
 purv solicytor general salve khaas taur par salmaan ke liye dilli se mumbai pahunche the
 There is no doubt that Harish Salve has done it on 6 May, he has become even more favorite of corporate houses, celebrities and politicians
 ek varisht vakil kehete hai, 'vah safal hai kyonki vah bahut mehnat karte hai or unke sochane kii kshamta jabardast he
 He never loses his temper and this is his specialty
 'dada criminal loyr, nani tex loyrasalve kaa janm nagpur main hua he
 His grandfather PK Salve was a well-known criminal lawyer of his time
 jabaki harish salve ne apane shuruaati dinon main bombai main apni tex loyr nani ke junior ke taur parkanoonee daanvpechaki sikh lee
 After being shifted from Mumbai to Delhi, Harish Salve worked with another reputed senior lawyer, Soli Sorabji
 saal 1992 main supreme court nehrish salveko 'varisht adhivaktaa' padavi di or 1999 main solicytor general banaaya
 But when the government offered him this post for the second consecutive time in 2002, he refused
 samajha jaataa he ki sattadhari dal congress se best bekri gujarat danga maamle main anban ke kaaran unhone aisa kiya
 However officially he cited 'personal' reasons
 harish salve or charchit maamlesaal 2011 main salve ne khud ko avaidh khanan maamle se alag kiya, jisamen vah ek se adhik party kaa pratinidhitiv kar chuke the
 In 2012, he helped Vodafone in a tax case of Rs 1,1000 crore
 reliance gas vivaad maamle main bhi harish salve mukesh ambani kii taraf se court main maujuud the
 At midnight, Harish Salve also put the Delhi Police's side in front of the court in the action against Baba Ramdev
 lekin salve ko apana vakil bananaa kaaphi kharchila bhi he
 It is said that Harish Salve charges up to Rs 30 lakh for a day
 yahi nahin, khabar he ki mukesh ambani ne gas vivaad maamle main sirf vakil par 15 karod rupee kharch kiye the
 No one comes to live forever, no one goes like you go, no one is a lion of a lot of Azmi
 10 may, 2002 ko jab ve is duniya se rukhsat hue to chaman jaise udhaas ho gaya
 He was the voice of helplessness and religion in the country
 shaayad hi koi aisi ghatana ho jis par unke shaayar man ne kuch na likhaa ho
 The reason for this was
 caphi ne yon to har tarah kii najmen likhin par unki baagi najmon ko zyada pasand kiya gaya
 That is why he was included in the progressive poets of Urdu
 kaifi aazmi kaa janm 14 janvari, 1919 ko mauza majavaan zila azamgarh main hua
 His real name was Syed Athar Hussain Rizvi and Kaifi Takhallus
 kaifi kaa khandaan ek kushhaal zameendaar khandaan tha
 The house had an atmosphere of education and literature and she'ar-o-shayari
 aise main shae’r-o-adab main unki dilchaspee swaabhaavik thi
 According to custom, he trained in Arabic, Persian and started saying She'ar
 shuruyaat unhone dharmik shaayari se kii or ishk-muhabbat kii jajbaati shaayari main chale gaye
 What did the people say about his romantic shayari - what did the laughter do? 
 
 ***jhuki jhuki si nazar beqaraar he ki nahindba dabaa sa sahi dil main pyaar he ki nahin
 
 
 *** So much that you are smiling, what is sorrow, which you are hiding
 
 
 ***aaj sochaa to ansu bhar aemuddatein ho gayi muskuraeek se bad kar ek nazm va shaayari, umdaa gazalen
 In the same period, he probably also wrote - In my heart you are the only medicine for your heart, what should i do, you should go, wherever you are, what should i do? 
 
 par pyaar ke jazbaat jald hi saamaajik sarokaaron se jud gaye
 Over time, his poetry became an authentic document of Awaam's pain
 apni pehali baagi najm unhone chaatr jivan main us samay likhi thi, jab ve ek shiya madrase main majahabi talim hasil karne gaye
 It happened that Kaifi's father had admitted him to sultan-ul-madaris in Lucknow, but Kaifi's inclination and resistance temperament were different
 chaatro kii durdasha par unhone chaatr union banaai or najm likhane or sunaane lage
 Kaifi raised his voice against the macro and dialectical system of the madrasa and his rebellious nudge was also published under the pseudonym 'qaumi Jung'
 par is siyaasi, saahitiyik chetana kaa puraskaar yah mila ki unki maangen to maan lee gayi par unhen hostel se nikaal diya gaya
 But by then he knew that he had to stand up for what
 i sabaa! laut ke kis shahar se tu aati he?teri har lahar se barood kii bu aati he!khun kahan bahata he insaan kaa pani kii tarahjis se tu rose yahan karke vaju aati he
 
 
 Contact with progressive writers brought much of his writing and personality
 tab tak vah es
 F
 ai
 Had become a member of and started to study privately
 1921 main kaifi lakhanu chhod kar kanpur aa gaye
 Here at that time the workers' movement was loud, Kaifi joined the movement
 kaifi ko kanpur kii fizaa bahut raas ai
 While living here, he studied Marxist literature deeply
 1923 main kaifi sardaar jafari or sajaad zahir ke kehane par mumbai- tab bombay- aa gaye or vidhivat rup se communist party ke card holder sadsy ban gaye
 In Bombay, he continued to work among trade union laborers and also performed poetry
 yaheen inhone 'ipta' natya sanghathan kii neenv daali or uske liye naatak, naare, shaayari va geet bhi likhe
 The country's atmosphere against the British rule and the Russian Revolution deeply influenced his views
 bharat ko mili kathith aazaadee se asantusht hokar unhone inkulab kaa aahvaan karte hue likhaa tha-koi to haath badhaayekoi to jimmaa leus inkulab kaajo aaj tak hua hi nahin
 Sajjad Zaheer wrote about the shayari of Kafi's earlier collection, 'A new flower blooming in the garden of modern Urdu poetry'
 " kaifi kii shaayari main vaicharik aaveg puri kalaatmakataa, ragaatmak or gitatmakataa ke saath maujuud he
 His poetry speaks to the feelings and emotions of the people
 unki shaayari awam kii shaayari he, sarvhaara mazdooron kii shaayari he, ummiido kii, sukh-dukh kii shaayari he
 Only Cafi can write this
 aaj kii raat badi garm hawa chalati haiaaj kii raat na footpath pe neend aayegisb uthen main bhi uthun, tum bhi utho, tum bhi uthokoi khidki isi diwaar main khul jaayegi
 Like a poet associated with the progressive movement, 'inquilab' was Cafi's weapon, so freedom, equality was his destination
 ek nai subah kaa sapana, ek nae vishwa samaajwaad kii pariklpana kaa sapana, par jab yah tutaa to unhone likhaa-basti main apni hindu-musalmaa jo bas gayeinsa kii shakl dekhne ko ham taras gayi
 Long before this, in the backdrop of the riots that occurred soon after independence, he wrote these lines of najam called 'khanajangi' - 'no hope comes, no face is seen, life is lost from neighbors, friends are afraid of the slayer coming out of the house Yes, the evening is evening
 
 
 baavjood in halaaton ke inasaaniyat par unka bharosa mitaa nahin
 He wrote with full confidence - 'we will extinguish the fire of fire'
 
 He also wrote extensively for half the world's population
 aarthik pareshaaniyon ke kaaran kaifi ne filmon ke liye geet bhi likhe
 First Kaifi got the opportunity to write two songs in Shahid Latif's film 'buzdil'
 dhire-dhire kaifi kii filmon se sambaddhta badhati gai
 Apart from songs, he also wrote story, dialogues and scripts
 film or bazaar kii duniya main bhi vah apane mulyon par tike rahe
 Films like 'kagaz Ke Phool', 'garm Hawa', 'haqiqat', 'heer Ranjha', are still taken with the name of Kaifi
 filmi duniya ne kaifi sahab ko bahut se sammaanon se nawaaza bhi
 The reason was his pen
 unke geeton kii kya range thi
 He was also awarded the National Award and the Filmfare Award
 unke likhe geeton ko sunen to aaj bhi kuch ho sa jaataa he -tum jo mil gaye ho, to ye lagata he ke jahaan mil gayaek bhatke hue raahi ko kaaravaan mil gaya***zaraa-si aahat hoti he to dil sochataa haikaheen ye wo to nahin, kahin ye wo to nahin***chalate-chalate yun hi koi mil gaya tha, saare raah chalate-chalatevahin tham ke rah gai he, meri raat dhalate-dhalate***dhire dhire machal i dil-e-beqararkoi aata haiyun tadap ke na tadapaa mujhe balamaakoi aata hadhire dhire 
 
 
 His poetry collection- 'jhankar', 'aakhir-e-shab', 'awara Sajde', 'hear my voice', was printed under the name 'majlisse Shura of Iblis
 unke saamaajik sarokaaron kaa alam yah tha ki jivan ke aakhri dinon main, aakhri saans tak vah apane paitruk gaanv mijawan ko aadhunik rup se suvidhapurna banane ke prayaason main lage rahe
 Despite suffering from diseases such as brain tumor and paralysis, he did not break down
 desh ke badalte halaat par vah itane andar tak aahat the ki unka gam is andaaj main chhalkaa tha-main dhundta hum jise wo jahaan nahin miltanai jameen nayaa aasmaan nahin miltanai jameen nayaa aasmaan bhi mil jayenye bashar kaa kahin kuch nishaan nahin miltaa
 
 
 Naman Kaifi sir! maharashtra sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko rajya ke pyaaj utpaadak kisaanon ke liye 150 karod rupee ke anudaan kii ghoshnaa kii gai he
 But onion growers are not happy with this
 ek hafte pehle jis kisaan ne apane 750 kilo pyaaj bechney par sirf 1064 rupee milane se naaraaz hokar yah paisa pradhanmantri narendra modi ke naam se mani order kar diya tha
 Farmers in the state have been demanding fair price of onions for a long time
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ko paisa mani order karne vaale kisaan sanjay saathe ne ajtak ko bataaya ki 150 karod rupee kaa anudaan yani ek quintal ke liye sirf 200 rupee yani ek kilo pyaaj par sirf 2 rupee atirikt paise sarkaar dene vaali he
 Sathe told Aaj Tak that this grant will be given to those farmers who sold onions in the main market from November 1 to December 15 and their onions got a lower price, but the situation today is very bad
 unhone naaraazgi jataate hue kaha ki kisaanon kapyaaj100 rupee quintal bechaa ja rahaa he
 Yanikisans are getting only this price of one rupee per kg
 sanjay saathe kaa sarkaar ko suzav he ki sabhi kisaanon ke liye ek jaisaa nirnay lenaa chahie
 Sathe said that according to a reputed institution that does research on onions, it costs 8 to 9 rupees to grow one kilo of onions
 to sarkaar kaa hisaab kahin to galat ho rahaa he yaa phir sarkaar ke numaayindon ko hisaab karnaa nahin aata
 Sathe said that the government should have taken a decision that could provide relief to all farmers
 saathe ne sabhi kisaanon se anurodh kiya he ki sarkaar dwaara die gaye is anudaan ko swikaarna nahin chahie or achche ghoshnaa ke liye sarkaar par dabaav bananaa chahie
 Jaitley said that on the dispute in the GST case, the council can say that two senior chief ministers and the finance minister together can resolve the issue politically
 yah kanoonee masalaa nahin he ki kitna fisadi bengal ko jaae or kitna fisadi hamaare paas rahe
 On the other hand, the Congress said it should refrain from commenting on the matters under consideration before the court, although later members of Congress were seen thumping the tables in Parliament
 dilli ke moti nagar ilaake main aasthaa ke naam par kaanvadiyon kii gundgardee kii tasviir saamne ai he
 Here the Kanvadis created a ruckus after a road accident and aroused their anger on a car
 car se ek kaanvdie ko chot lagane ke baad kaanvadiyon ne lathi-dandon se car par buree tarah hamalaa bol diya
 Crowds of Kanwari started lathi on one car after another
 kisi ne car ke bonete par hamalaa kiya to kisi ne car kii khidkiyaan hi ukhaad deen
 Crowds of Kanwari gathered on the road one after the other and all started lathiing on the car
 is dauraan sadak par trephic chalata rahaa lekin kisi ne kaanvadiyon ke paas jane kii himmat tak nahin kii
 Even after breaking the glass and windows of the turned carcar, the anger of the Kanwari did not calm down
 aakhir main unhone puri car ko palat diya
 After this, the policemen reached the spot but they too failed to stop the Utaru Kanvadi on hooliganism
 police kii maujuudagi main bhi kaanvadiyon kii bheed car par gussa nikaalati rahi
 It was said that a devotee was hurt by the Centro car at the Tanga stand near Moti Nagar metro station on Tuesday evening, after which the Kanwari killed the car
 police kaa kahana he ek mahila car drive kar rahi thi, uske saath ek purush bhi tha
 However, the couple has not suffered any injuries

 Richard Hallbrook, the special US envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan, said, "in relation to this attack, i do not accept that it was like an attack on Indian establishments such as the Indian Embassy
" vah aasaani se lakshya banaaya jane vaala nishaanaa tha
 Do not arrive at any result
 ’afghanistan ke raashtrapati hamid karaji ne kaha tha ki hamalon kaa nishaanaa bhartiya the

 But please, do not draw any result that has no proof
 ’haalanki afghanistan kii khufia seva ke pravaktaa ne bataaya ki unki agency ke paas is baat ke saboot hai ki 26 farvari ko hue is hamale main pakistan, khaas taur par lashkar-e-tayba shaamil tha
 The American envoy said that the interests of both India and Pakistan are linked to Afghanistan
 ansaari ne kaha ki hotel main bhartiya kahaan the, is tarah kii jaankaree pataa karnaa afgaan taliban ke liye bahut mushkil he
 Six Indians, an Italian, a French film producer, three Afghan policemen and four civilians were killed in this attack in Kabul
 iske alaava ek atyant kshat vikshat shav mila tha jisaki pahchaan nahin ho saki thi
 The Washington Post, however, said that US intelligence officials in Kabul believe the attack was carried out by the Haqqani network of Pakistan's Afghan militant group
 lekin akhbaar ke anusaar, bhartiya adhikariyon ko ashanka he ki do aatanki samoohon ne ek saath milakar is hamale ko anjaam diya
 The Post said that the involvement of lashkar-e-toiba in this attack has deep meaning because 14 months later last week India and Pakistan Foreign Secretary level talks took place
 bharat or afghanistan ne pehle bhi 2008 main kabul sthit bhartiya duutavas par bam dhamaake liye pakistan or uski sahaayta se chalaae ja rahe hakaani network ko gheraa tha

 He told the Post, 'lashkar is with the Taliban
 ’ pakistani senadhikari ne kaha ki lashkar ke aatanki uttari wajiristaan main hakkaani network ke saath prashikshan le rahe hai
 The Washington Post said that it is clear from the indications that there is a clear connection between the terrorist organizations of Pakistan and Afghanistan and this is proved by the February 24 attack on Sunni terrorist organization lashkar-e-zahavi chief Qari Zafar
 jafar kaa sanghathan pakistan main bana tha lekin uski hatya hakkaani network or taharik e taliban pakistan ke garh uttari wajiristaan main kar di gayi thi
 The Haqqani network, operated by Siraj Haqqani, has been a source of trouble for the American military in Afghanistan and has been involved in several attacks in Kabul

 congress ke mukhpatr 'sandesh' main desh kii aazaadee ke liye balidaan dene waalon ke liye jatisuchak shabdon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 There has been a very sharp reaction after the matter came to light
 desh kii aazaadee ke liye mar mite shahid kabhi apni jati yaa sampradaay se nahin jane jate, lekin shahid diwas ke avasar par congress ke mukhpatr 'congress sandesh' main chape ek lekh main bhagat singh, raajaguru or sukhdev jaise shaheedon kii jati bataai gai he
 Not only this, words like 'involved in the murder of Saunders' have been used to describe Sukhdev
 bijepi ne congress ke mukhpatr sandesh ke march sanskaran main chape lekh main badi chook par bavaal machaa diya he auki shaheedon ke apmaan par congress se maafee maangane ko kaha he
 'sandesh' states that Bhagat Singh was born in a Jat family, Rajguru was born in a Brahmin family, while Shaheed Rajguru was told to write Rajguru Thapar that he was involved in the murder of Saunders
 shahid raajaguru ke bare main 'hatya kii vaardaat main shaamil' jaise shabdon kaa istemaal kitna aapattijanak he, aasaani se samajha ja saktaa he
 However, on this issue, there is a growing trend in political circles

 What to do if Kareena does not understand? Kareena Kapoor is familiar with a difficult question of life
 ek taraf bvaay frienddoosri taraf best friend
 Whom should Kareena be with? Who is Kareena angry? Kareenakrina Kapoor's dilemma between two films is about her upcoming two films and her hero
 karina ko apane bvaay friend saf ali khan ke saath pehali baar romentic film main kaam karne kaa mauka mila
 Kareena's dream project 'kurbaan' is ready
 'qurbaan' thik waisi hi film he jaisi karina chaahati thim
 What to do if Kareena does 'kurbaan' is ready, then Aamir Khan's 'three Idiots' was ready with that
 vahi aamir khan jinke saath kaam karnaa karina kapur kaa sapana rahaa he
 Aamir first cast Kareena as a heroine in this film
 donon filmein release honevaali hai
 But the dates for the promotional events are colliding
 agar karina saf kii 'qurbaan' ke badale aamir khan kii 'thri idiyats' ke pramotion par zyada jor degi, to mumkin he, chote nawab saf naaraaz ho jaayen
 On the other hand, if Kareena prefers 'kurbaan', she may be accused that she is working only on Boy Friend's suggestion
 unhe apane baaki projects kii koi chintaa nahin he
 Surprised-troubled are two ways for Kareena
 yaa to wo 'thri idiyats' or 'qurbaan' ke pramotion shos ko baraabar ahmiyat den yaa phir donon se dur rahen

 The President said, 'we want access to Indian markets
 ham bharat main apana maal bechnaa chaahate hai
 It would not be unfair for us to say that if we have opened our market, then the economy of the countries with which we do business should also be open to us

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter india today ne isi saal july main khulaasa kiya tha ki kis tarahvaranasike ghaaton par ganga nadi kaa pradooshan 2014 kii tulana main ghatane kii jagah or bad gaya
 In 2014, the Modi government launched the ambitious 'namami Gange' mission to clean the Ganges river
 ise padhein: Exclusive: kaisaa namaami gange? modi sarkaar ke samay main or maili hui ganga, 58% bacteria badhedesh kii sabase pavitra maani jane vaali nadi main swatchta ke str ke bare main or jaanane ke liye india today ne ganga punaruddhar mantralay ko soochna ke adhikaar (artiai) ke tahat yachika bheji
 In the petition, we were asked about the new projects started to clean the Ganges, how much money was allocated to them, their completion date and their possible impact
 jawaab main bharat sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya, ‘is project ke liye 20,000 karod rupye aavantit kiya ja chukaa he jo ki agle paanch saal main kharch kiya jayega (2015-2020)’
 In response, it has been further said that a total of 221 projects have been approved for various activities under the Takanamami Ganga program
 in gatividhiyon main 22238
 Municipal sewage treatment, treatment of industrial waste, cleaning of river surface etc
 at a cost of Rs 73 crore
 inamen se 58 project puure kar liye gaye hai’
 What does this answer mean is that 2238 out of the funds allocated on projects
 73 karod rupye zyada sweekrut kiye ja chuke hai or abhi dedh saal or baaki he
 But so far only a quarter of the total approved projects have been completed
 sivej treetment plant ke bare main artiai se mili jawaab main kaha gaya he, ab tak 105 sivarej iffrastracchars or astipi projects sweekrut kiye ja chuke hai, jinase bina treet kiye hue 3293
 68 MLD sewage will be prevented from falling directly into the Ganges river
 kul 26 project ab tak puure kiye ja chuke hai’
 Here also only a quarter of the approved projects can be completed
 sarkaar ne apane jawaab main aage kaha, ‘jo project ab tak liye gaye hai, unase 2035 tak ganga kii mukhya dhara kii sivej treetment jaruraton ke liye aavashyak sabhi kadamon kaa dhyaan rakhaa ja sakegaa’
 In May 2018, Union Water Resources Minister Gadkari set a new deadline of March 2019 to clean the Ganges
 saath hi daawa kiya tha ki tab tak ganga ke pani kii gunvattta 70 se 80 pratishat tak behatar ho jaaegi
 In such a situation when only a quarter of the approved projects can be completed by August 2018, how can the government fulfill its promises regarding the cleanliness of the Ganges? What miracle will happen in the next 6-7 months? Before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the issue of cleanliness of the Ganga was also important in the major electoral issues of the BJP
 lekin sarkaar kii apni stats report ke hisaab se hi usne ganga kii safai kaa jo vaada kiya tha, uske puraa hone kii sambhaavna bahut kam he
 What did the government say on India Today's RTI revelations? 'the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) is committed to achieve the goal of cleaning the Ganges and is working towards this in mission mode
 ” projects ke kriyanvayan or amal kii maujuuda tej raftaar ko dekhte hue ganga ko saaf karne ke lakshya ko jald se jald hasil kar liya jayega’
 It has also been said by the government that out of the Rs 20,000 crore budget allocated, only about 17,000 crore rupees have been approved so far

 In this whole process, he set up an institute whose annual revenue is Rs 19,000 crore
 ke kareeb tha
 He is considered the father of Public Private Partnership (PPP) in India and has a specialist in implementing projects in diverse fields such as road, water, energy, ports, regional development and environmental infrastructure
 uskaa vittiya dhaancha abhedya tha tab tak, jab tak uski dirghakaalin dendariyaan sankat main nahin aane lageen
 Due to this, the survival of the company started to threaten and fear of it caused a stir in the stock markets
 phir jab is company ne apni rin adaayagi main chuknaa shuru kiya or samoochee gaiyr-banking vittiya company (enbiensi) kshetra main uthapatak hone kaa khatra paidaa ho gaya to ek ascharyajanak kadam main 1 aktubar ko centre sarkaar ne vittiya bazaaron ko aashwast karne vaala kadam uthaate hue neshnal company lau tribunel (ensielti) main darakchvast daalkar company ke board ke sabhi sadasyon ko badal daalaa
 Now the new phase of the company has started with the six-member board taking over the leadership of Uday Kotak, Vice Chairman and MD of Kotak Mahindra Bank

 Then in 1989 he was also made the Managing Director
 unke saath vibhinn pariyojnaon main kaam kar chuke marchent bankers kehete hai ki siio ke rup main parthasarathi kii aakraamakata 1990 ke dashak main to ielandeeyes jaisi shuruaati company ke liye raas ai kyonki use fund jutaney or dhanchaagat pariyojnaayen khojane, donon main phayda mila
 Independent Advisor Ashwin Parekh said, "he was very optimistic
 '' yah parthasarathi ke liye uplabdhi kii hi baat thi ki 2011 main ielandeeyes ne satyam ghotaale ke saamne aane se ain pehle metas infrastracchar kaa niyantran apane haath main le liya
 She was also a Ramalinga Raju promoted company
 phir unhone ielandeeyes transportesan network (itnel) ko sadak kshetra main pramukh khilaadi ke rup main sthapit kar diya
 In addition, he expanded the group to several sectors and established subsidiary companies in each of them
 company takreeban 200 fermon kaa samooh ban gai thi jo sari kii sari holding form ke rup main ielandeeyes ke adheen thim—jinamein darjan bhar companiyaan thim, 23 pratyaksh sabsidiariyaan thim or 141 apratyaksh sabsidiariyaan
 Apart from these, there were six joint ventures and four associate companies
 jaise-jaise form aage badi, parthasarathi kii haisiyat bhi badhati rahi
 He was made vice-chairman and MD in 1994 and then Chairman and MD in November 2004
 tej chalane vaale parthasarathi ko shuruaati daur main is baat se madad mili ki us samay arthvyavastha ko dhanchaagat funding kii khaasi jarurat thi
 When the government adopted the policy of liberalization in the year 1991, there was a great need for projects in PPP sector
 us vakt kii kya jarurat thi, is baat kaa andaja isi se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki sarkari swaamitv vaale teen bade sansthanonkricentral bank of india, tatkaaleen houseing deveopment finance korporation (echdiefasi) or unit trust of india ne milakar ielandeeyes kaa gathan karne kaa bidaa uthaaya

 But when Parthasarathy was growing business rapidly and had interfered in almost every infrastructure sector
 duusari taraf shaayad ve lambey samay main banane vaale halaat ko nazarandaaj kar rahe the
 In the process, IL&FS raised about Rs 91,000 crore
 kaa karj apane sir odh liya or phir usne rin ke punarbhugtan main chook karnaa shuru kar diya
 Parthasarathy's sudden resignation in July this year due to health reasons added to the confusion
 paarekh kehete hai, "mujhe mahasoos hua ki kuch to sanrachanaatmak gadabadi he kyonki koi lambii dendaree nahin thi
 "IL&FS does fund long-term projects with a tenure of more than 10 years, but its borrowings are short-term, increasing the asset-liability gap
" parthasarathi ko ummid thi ki sarkaar do kaam karegi—ek to jis kshan koi pariyojna parichaalan shuru kar leti he usee ke saath sarkaar kisi tarah kii koi biout pranali khadi kar legi or doosraa, ek rin sanvardhan beuro sthapit karegi taaki jab bhi kisi infrastracchar funding sanghathan ko koi pariyojna vyavhaarya nahin lagati, vah beuro dakhal dekar kisi tarah kaa bafer yaa taralata uplabdh karaayega
 Parekh says, "nothing of this happened
 is prishthbhumi main ielandeeyes ko yah samaj janaa chahie tha ki ve apni taangen baandhakar daud laga rahe hai

 Around the Lehman crisis in America, we also have many big projects, especially the power sector projects stuck in deadlock
 ielandeeyes ko bhi unase khaasi dikkatein huin lekin parthasarathi ne tab bhi ummiden rakhin or ve zyada se zyada sampada jutaney main lage rahe
 The first signs of bad health of the company were started from the annual inspection report of RBI for the year 2014-15
 usamen kaha gaya tha ki ielandeeyes financial services ke shuddh swaamitv vaale fund kaa safaya ho chukaa he or ab unako hakeekat se zyada dohan kiya ja rahaa he
 But the management of IL&FS denied the Reserve Bank's view and refused to take any corrective steps
 yahi vah sanyam tha jab parthasarathi kii sehat bhi gir rahi thi or ve baahar aane kii taiyaari main the
 Nothing has gone right since then

 On September 24th, for the third time in that month, IL&FS defaulted on payment of interest on commercial papers
 commercial papers kisi nigam se jari ansexor, alpavadhi rin pratibhutiyaan hoti hai or unka makasad khaaton kii praapt raashi va inventary kii financing karnaa or alpavadhi dendariyon kii purti karnaa hota he

 The danger is that about 60% of IL&FS borrowings are in the form of non-convertible debentures which are not protected by any physical assets or securities
 in dibentures kaa bada hissaa beemaa companiyon, pension fundon va bhavishyanidhi fundon ke paas he, jin par desh ke madhyavarg kii sari bachat nirbhar karti he

 In the Rajya Sabha, Ram Gopal is the only leader in the Rajya Sabha who has been removed from the sp's SP leader, six years from the party, no letter has been given to the state secretariat to remove him from the party and to elect the new leader

 ab ramgopal sapa ko akhilesh ko saunpane or amar-shivpal ko kinare karne karne kii vakaalat karte rahe hai
 Akhilesh is also convinced of Ram Gopal's strategy

 Cartoonist Aseem Trivedi said on Wednesday that he did not make any mistake by making cartoons so he would not apologize because he did not make any mistake
 rajdroh ke aarope main jail main band cartoonist aseem trivedi ko buudhvaar ko reeha kar diya gaya
 He was granted bail on Tuesday after a nationwide crackdown on the charges leveled against India Against Corruption (IAC) activist Trivedi
 trivedi ko arthur road jail main rakhaa gaya tha
 Soon after his release from prison, he said, 'I respect the law but i do not respect the law that makes us feel that we are not living in an independent country
 'unase jab yah poocha gaya ki kya aisa cartoon bananaa uchit he ki 26 / 11 hamale ke doshi aatankwaadi ajmal kasaab ko bhartiya samvidhan par peshaab karte dikhaaya jaae, trivedi ne kaha ki unhone vahi kiya jo unhone dekha or ise anya tareeke se dekhne kaa koi kaaran nahin he
 He said he had no need to apologize
 unhone kaha, 'yah ladaai meri ladaai he, jo yahaan samaapt nahin hoti
 We will continue fighting until the charges of treason imposed under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code are quashed
 'unhone kaha, 'ham abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke liye yah ladaai jari rakhenge
 At the time of Trivedi's release, around 50 people, including IAC activist Mayank Gandhi, were present outside the jail to welcome him
 iasi sadsy kareeb 10 minute tak jail ke baahar naare lagaate rahe or phir trivedi kii rihaai ke baad ek chote juluus ke rup main vahaan se ravaanaa hue
 Due to the sensitivity of the situation, adequate security arrangements were made in the area
 isi jail main 26 / 11 ke aatankwaadi hamale kaa doshi ajmal kasaab band he
 Trivedi later thanked her for the media support in their fight
 trivedi ne kaha ki vah unka samarthan karne vaale sabhi logon ke prati kritagya hai
 Asked about his refusal to be released on bail earlier, he said that he wanted the government to first drop the charges of treason against him
 unhone kaha, 'main nahin chahta ki yah sandesh jaae ki main sahyog nahin kar rahaa hum lekin main yah bhi chahta tha ki sarkaar sweekaar kare ki usne mujh par rajdroh ke aarope lagaakar galati kii he
 That is why i refused to be released on bail earlier
 ' unhone kaha, 'main sahyog na karne vaala vyakti nahin hum or jab iasi sadasyon ne is sambandh main mujhase baat kii to maine jamaanat sweekaar kar lee
 The Bombay High Court, while hearing a PIL filed by a lawyer named Sanskar Marathe, on Tuesday ruled to grant bail on a personal bond of Rs 5,000
 trivedi ko pichley shanivaar ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha or 24 sitambar ko unhen saat din kii police hiraasat main bhej diya gaya tha
 He was charged with treason for insulting the national emblem, including the Constitution, by drawing cartoons during Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement in December 2011
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani bhi cartoonist aseem trivedi ke samarthan main aage aa gaye
 He said he was surprised at Trivedi's arrest for alleged treason and felt that the current political system was worse than the Emergency
 adwani ne buudhvaar ko apane blog par likhaa ki vah naagarik swatantraaaon va abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ke daman ke maamle main hameshaa se apatkaal ke 1975 se 77 tak ke samay ko ab tak kaa sabase bura samay maanate rahe the
 He said, "but i am surprised to see what happened to political cartoonist and anti-corruption agitator Aseem Trivedi and i wonder if today's political system is worse than Emergency
" ' trivedi ko bombay ucch nyaayalay ne mangalvaar ko jamaanat de di thi lekin unhone tab tak reeha hone se manaa kar diya he, jab tak un par lagaaya gaya rajdroh kaa aarope na hataa liya jaae
 Meanwhile, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray also supported Trivedi
 lekin unhone trivedi kii khinchaai karte hue unhen aage aisa na karne kii chetavanee bhi di
 Thackeray termed the sedition charge leveled against Trivedi by the Mumbai Police as a big charge
 lekin unhone bhartiya rashtriya pratik, samvidhan va sansad kaa cartoonon ke jariye majaak banane ke liye trivedi kii khinchaai bhi kii
 He said in an editorial in the party mouthpiece 'saamana' that Trivedi has definitely insulted the national symbols but putting him in jail on charges of treason is not right
 unhone 11 saal pehle sansad par hamalaa karne vaale aatankwaadi afjal guru kii samanaantar charchaa karte hue kaha ki use mrityudand kii sajaa sunaae jane ke baad bhi vah sarkaar ke aatithy kaa anand le rahaa he, vahiin sirf ek cartoon banane vaale trivedi par rajdroh ke aarope laga die gaye hai
 Thackeray, himself a cartoonist, said that Trivedi, through his cartoons, has shown the current sad state of Parliament in scams but does not mean that he can break the boundaries
 thakare ne kaha ki trivedi kaa kahana he ki unhone deshbhakti kii bhaavana se bharkar yah cartoon banaaya lekin unhen sansad kaa sammaan karnaa chahie or uskaa is tarah apmaan nahin karnaa chahie
 a few days before the assembly elections, controversy has arisen with the removal of the history of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj from the fourth grade books of the Maharashtra International Board of Education (MIEB)
 is kadam ko lekar shiksha vibhaag kii aalochana ho rahi he
 On the other hand, Maharashtra State Educational Research and Training Council (MSCERT) blamed 'misunderstanding' for this controversy and said that no attempt has been made to remove Shivaji Maharaj from the syllabus
 duusari ore vipakshi congress or rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) ke aakraamak tevar dekh rajya ke mantri vinod taavade ne kaha ki 17 veen shatabdi ke maratha yoddha raja kaa adhyay chauthi kaksha kii itihaas kii paathya pustak main shaamil jayega
 Congress General Secretary Jyotiraditya Scindia, Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat and former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan have criticized it
 thoraat or chavaan ne kaha ki yah shivaji ke prati bhaajapa-shivasena sarkaar ke "farji" prem ko darshata he
 While addressing an election rally in Nandgaon, Nashik, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said, 'this chapter was so that the students of the fourth grade understand the work of Shivaji Maharaj, but the government has now removed that chapter
 ' unhone kaha, 'lekin us adhyay ko hataa diya gaya he
 
 
 And these people talk of taking the state forward on the basis of Shivaji's ideology
 ' isse pehle schuli shiksha mantri vinod taavade ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki MIEB ke paathyakram main kaksha chaar tak alag paathyakram nahin he
 He said that under the board which came into existence four years ago, different subjects like history, geography and science will be started from class five
 haalanki media main ai khabar ke anusaar shivaji ke jivan or unke jivan se judi ghatnaon ko MIEB kii kaksha chaar kii pustakon se nikaal diya gaya he
 Vikas Gard, deputy director of MSCERT said, 'there was some misunderstanding and incomplete information on this subject
 rajya board ke paathyakram se chhatrapati shivaji ko hataane kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya gaya he
 'he said that MIEB has recently started 81 schools
 itihaas vishay kaksha paanch se shuru kiya jayega, jisamen pracheen or madhyakaalin itihaas par jor diya jayega
 'there are plans to teach a detailed history of Shivaji Maharaj from class six
 maharashtra antarrashtriya shiksha board kii sthapana taavade ke shiksha mantri rahane ke dauraan kii gayi thi
 At the same time, Tawde said, 'if you look at the books of class six, you will get mention of the achievements of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj

 ''hamaara mahakama apni sampati ko lekar gambhir he, nahin to aaj saikadon maamle adaalat main nahin hote
 Is this really so? The facts found under the information sought under the Right to Information, reveal a completely opposite picture

 The Mahaveer Cancer Institute of Patna is known for its treatment of cancer

 What an impression it has left on the patient and his family, such as cancer, was visible

 While the shoot was going on, my eyes were moving around
 is bich meri nazar ek bujurg ke upar padi, sir jhukaa kar baithe yah bujurg kaaphi pareshaan najar aa rahe the
 Then i started talking to them
 inkaa naam subansh sahu he, bihar ke jahanabad jile ke ek chote se gaanv ke rahane vaale hai
 Having been treating his wife for three months
 pehle jahanabad ke kisi aspataal main ilaaj karvaa rahe the, ab kareeb ek maheene se is mahavir santhaan main ilja karvaa rahe hai
 Serve his wife alone, take wife for checkup, take bathroom, feed medicine, put oil in her feet when needed, take care in every way
 jab maine poocha ki ilaaj ke liye kitne paise kharch hue? unka jawaab tha, abhi tak kareeb 60 hazaar rupee kharch ho chuke hai
 Have sold the buffalo that was in the village

 In this hospital, BPL card holders are provided almost free treatment

 But the son does not ask
 ek betaa patna main rahata he
 Came to meet only once, stopped for a while
 maine jab poocha ki kya aapkaa betaa aap logon ko apane ghar nahin le jaataa
 i could clearly see tears in the eyes of the elderly
 vah apane aansu chhipaane kii koshish kar rahe the lekin chipa nahin paa rahe the
 Intermittently speaking, the son says that if he keeps his sick wife in the house, then he can also become a victim of this disease
 yah baat sunakar vahaan par baithe log hairaan ho gaye
 People started talking, how can a son do this
 phir maine poocha, aapke jo do or bete hai kya vah bhi nahin poochhate hai? bujurg kaa jabaab tha koi nahin poochta
 Nobody paid for the treatment
 kabhi-kabhi phone kar baat kar letaa he lekin aaj tak koi milane nahin aayaa
 When the elders were talking about me, the grief of their sick wife was clearly visible to me
 vah kaaphi bhavuk ho gai thi
 She was crying secretly
 lekin phir bhi khud apane beton kii shikaayat nahin kar rahi thi
 Her mother's affection was clearly visible in her eyes
 tippaniyan Then i asked, does not your daughter also ask you
 bujurg kaa jawaab tha, beti puuchhati he
 While in Jehanabad, the daughter stayed for a month and also served
 lekin jab patna aa gaye tab beti nahin aa pai
 The daughter is married and has to take care of her in-laws
 lekin beti phone karke haalchaal jarur puuchhati he
 The elder also said, 'I am proud of my daughter
 ' Then when i was about to leave, the elder asked me about me? i said that i am from the media and our shoot is going on here
 to bujurg ne poocha, meri yah khabar aap chhaapenge? phir maine unase sawaal kiya ki chhapane se aapkaa kya phayda hoga? bujurg kaa jabaab tha, chaahe meraa phayda ho na ho lekin aisi kahani chapani chahie

 If such a story can instill a son's love for his parents, then it is a big deal
 mere man main kai sawaal khadey ho rahe the
 While talking, i asked if no one else came from your family to take care of your wife
 The elders paused for a while, sighing in long breath, having three sons and a daughter
 lekin betaa log poochta nahin
 a son lives in Patna
 sirf ek baar milane aayaa tha, kuch der ruk kar chalaa gaya
 When i asked if your son does not take you home
 bujurg kii ankhon main aansu mujhe saafe nazar aa rahe the
 He was trying to hide his tears but could not hide
 ruk-ruk kar bole, betaa kahata he agar yah unki biimaar patni ko ghar main rakhega to vah bhi is beemaari kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 Hearing this, the people sitting there were surprised
 log baat karne lage, ek betaa aisa kaise kar saktaa he
 Then i asked, don't you also have two more sons? Nobody asks the answer of the elderly
 koi bhi ilaaj ke liye paisa nahin diya
 Sometimes he calls and talks but till date no one came to meet him
 jab bujurg apni baat bataa rahe the tab unki biimaar patni kaa dukh mujhe saafe nazar aa rahaa tha
 She had become very emotional
 munh chhipaakar ro rahi thi
 But still she was not complaining about her sons
 unki ankhon main maa kii mamata saafe jhalak rahi thi
 The comments phir maine poocha, kya aapaki beti bhi aap ko nahin puuchhati he
 The elder's answer was, the daughter asks
 jab jahanabad main the tab beti ek maheene ke liye rukii thi or seva bhi kii thi
 But when she came to Patna, the daughter could not come
 beti kii shaadi ho chuki he or use apane sasuraal kaa khyaal bhi rakhana he
 But the daughter calls and asks about the situation
 bujurg ne yah bhi bolaa, 'mujhe apni beti par garv he
 ' phir jab main vahaan se nikalne vaala tha, bujurg ne mujhase mere bare main poocha? maine bolaa ki main media se hum or yahaan hamaara shoot chal rahaa he
 So the elder asked, will you print my news? Then i questioned him, what would be your benefit from printing? The answer of the elderly was, even if i do not benefit, but such a story should be published
 agar aisi kahani ek bete ke man main apane mata-pita ke liye pyaar paidaa kar sakati he to yah bahut badi baat he
 i could clearly see tears in the eyes of the elderly

 We had a lot of fun together '

 The film also stars Farhan Akhtar, Priyanka Chopra, Anushka Sharma, Shefali Shah
 film paanch june ko relies ho rahi he
 India's border dispute with China at Doklam is yet to be resolved, meanwhile, there have been reports of incursions by the Chinese Army into Uttarakhand
 pipuls libration army (PLA) ke javaanon ne chamoli jile ke barahoti main ghuspaith kii he
 According to the information, this infiltration was done on 26 July
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki chinis sena ke jawan kareeb 2 ghante tak bhartiya seemaa main rahe
 However, the Chinese army later had to return after protests by ITBP jawans
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki 26 july kii subah kareeb 8
 9 from 30 PM
 30 baje ke bich piele ke jawan barahoti seemaa se andar aa gaye
 About 200-300 soldiers of the Chinese army entered the Indian border by 300 meters
 itibipijavaanon ne jab unka ye movement dekha to unhone virodh kiya
 After which the Chinese army returned
 bataa den ki jis ilaake main chinis sena ke javaanon ne ghuspaith kii, wo vivaadit mana jaataa he
 Indian Army personnel have been patrolling in this area
 haalanki, wo bina uniform ke yahaan petroling karte hai
 This is not the first time that Chinese army personnel have come to this area
 donon deshon kii sena ke jawan saal main ek baar maujuudagi dikhaane ke liye yahaan petroling karte rahete hai
 The Dragon Army did this when the summit of the BRICS national security advisors was to be held in Beijing
 isamen shaamil hone ke liye bharat ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal bhi beijing pahunche the
 According to sources in the Ministry of External Affairs, such incidents have happened before and they are resolved
 videsh mantralay ne ghuspaith kii is ghatana ko tavajjo na dene kii baat kahi he
 At the same time, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand has also expressed concern over this incident
 unhone kaha he ki ye antarrashtriya seemaa kaa maamla he or behad samvedansheel he
 He said that our army is there to deal with every difficulty
 maharashtra main ke chunavi nateezon main bhaajapa sabase badi party ke rup main ubhari lekin, bahumat se 22 siten peeche rah gai, vahiin party kii puraani sahyogi shivasena 63 siton ke saath duusare number par rahi he
 In this entire result, where the BJP is now in need of an ally, the Shiv Sena, which has been an ally of the BJP for 25 years, is no longer in a position to ask for more
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki ensipi ne apni taraf se bhaajapa kii sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan dene kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 It is believed that Shiv Sena is not getting a chance to create pressure
 is chunaav main ensipi ke paas 41 siten hai or bhaajapa ko bahumat ke liye maatr 22 siton kii jarurat he
 It is noteworthy that others also have 19 seats
 shivasena ne kaha ki vah baatcheet ke liye taiyaar he, agar koi prastaav aayega tab vah us par baat karegi
 Attacking BJP, Thackeray also said that he can go with NCP if he wants
 lekin baad main unhone amit shah se baat kii
 It is noteworthy that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has spoken to Bharatiya Janata Party chief Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi if no party gets a clear majority after the election results in Maharashtra
 yah jaankaree shivasena ke sutron ne di he
 The source present in Matoshree said that PM Modi was also present when the call was made and he also spoke to Thackeray
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kareeb 10 minute tak chali is baatcheet main kisi samjhaute par nahin pahunchaa gaya, sirf yah baat hui ki aage badhanaa chahie
 Taking strong stand on Iran's controversial nuclear program, the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday imposed new sanctions against it, targeting its powerful Revolutionary Guards and nuclear-related investment
 paanch sthaayee sadasyon or 10 asthaayee sadasyon vaali sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke 12 sadasyon ne iran ke khilaaf pratibandh prastaav ke samarthan main vot diya jabaki brazil or turki ne pratibandhon kaa virodh karte hue iran ke samarthan main vot diya
 Lebanon remained the only member who did not participate in the voting
 buudhvaar ko sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main laayaa gaya prastaav iran ke khilaaf chauthaa prastaav tha jo do ke mukaable 12 mat se paarit ho gaya
 This includes restrictions on Iran's investment in nuclear activities abroad, restrictions on ballistic missile activities, restrictions on the use of banks abroad by Iran and confiscation of property of members of the Islamic Revolutionary Gordes Corps
 is prastaav ke tahat islamic revolutionari guards kor dwaara sanchalit 15 udhyamon, islamic republic of iran shipping lines ke teen udhyamon or 23 audyogic companiyon ko kaali suchi main daal diya gaya he
 The international community alleges that Iran is trying to make nuclear weapons, but Iran has denied the charge
 iran kaa kahana he ki uskaa uranium sanvardhan kaarykram shantipurna asainya uddeshyon ke liye he
 India has been saying that it opposes such sanctions against Iran because it will affect the common people of Iran more than the nuclear establishment
 iran ke khilaaf pratibandhon kaa kabhi virodh karte rahe rus or china ne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke is prastaav kaa samarthan kiya he or kaha he ki prastaav ke paath se ve khush hai kyonki isse iran ke logon par koi bura asar nahin padegaa
 Turkey and Brazil are disappointed after the resolution was passed against Iran as they mediated a deal with Iran for a fuel swap and hoped that it could avoid Iran sanctions
 ullekhneey he ki iran ke khilaaf pratibandhon ke liye sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main isse pehle varsh 2006, 2007 or 2008 main teen prastaav paarit kiye ja chuke hai
 The Prime Minister has launched the Narendra Modi mobile app
 is mobile ap main pradhanmantri kii dainik gatividhiyaan uplabdh hongi
 What are they doing, whom are they meeting, etc
 
 
 
 You can download it on your Android phone from Google's Playstore
 iske zariye aapako sidhe pradhanmantri kii taraf se email or massej milenge
 There will also be a compilation of Mann Ki Baat programs which you will be able to listen to in leisure time
 isamen bharat sarkaar se judi suchanaaen bhi hongi
 You will be asked questions about which scheme is bringing an effective change in the country
 aap tik karenge or survey kii tarah nateeja aa jayega
 Your email account is asked before downloading this app
 jisase aap ek data bank main register ho jaaenge or phir aapako sarkaar kii soochnaaon or prachaaron ke sandesh aane lagenge
 Whatever information will be in the mobile app, it is on the government's different websites and on the Twitter handle and Facebook page of ministers and ministries
 piemo kii bhi apni website he
 These mediums should be studied how the things written here impacted the institutions and how have the experiences of people changed with these tools
 sarkaar hi nahin, tamaam vipakshi netaaon ke soshal media par zaahir baton kaa bhi adhyayan hona chahie
 It will then be known whether these mediums are meant to keep the bells of their presence among the people or are they really for changing the system according to the public opinion being formed everyday
 dekhnaa chahie ki isse laabh janata ko hota he yaa netaa ko
 These media media tools are just another medium between newspaper, TV and various types of advertisements
 vyapak shodh or samaj ke abhaav main kuch bhi nishchit rup se kahana mushkil he
 But going through the communication processes in these mediums, it seems that they are not transparent
 paardarshita kaa bhram paidaa kiya jaataa he
 You feel that you are in touch with the leader, but as soon as you ask the basic question, the leader is silenced in the same way as before
 sushamaa swaraj or vasundhara raaje ke maamle main log pradhanmantri ko sunanaa chaahate hai, magar rose subah unke yogasana kii tasveeron ke twit se hi santosh karnaa hota he
 The tweets of his visits and congratulations come, but it is not known what happened in his meetings
 santulan ke liye aap kah sakate hai ki yahi haal rahul gandhi yaa anya netaaon kaa bhi he
 a lot of journalists too
 i-gavarnence kii dhooma ke ab das saal se bhi zyaada vakt ho rahe hai
 By now it should have been studied concretely whether e-governance is transparency
 kya isse kisi sanstha kaa peshewar pradarshan behatar hua he
 In some cases the situation seems better with e-governance but it is not a solution to the problem
 passport seva ek safal udhaaharan ho sakati he, lekin railway ke tikat kii website hone ke baad bhi logon main vishwaas nahin he ki vahaan sab kuch paardarshee tareeke se hi hota he
 For years, people have been dissatisfied with the railway ticket website
 har rail bajet main logon ko soochna dene ke liye koi na koi number launch ho jaataa he magar isse na to train ke aane jane ke pradarshnon par asar padaa or na hi tikaton kii uplabdhta par or na hi yatra anubhavon par
 We should ask the question that if there is e-governance transparency then why are rtis
 kyon nahin har file rozaana sarkaar kii website par aplod kar di jaati he
 Why are the minutes of departmental meetings not on the website or mobile app
 i-gavarnence or mobile ap paardarshita ke pramaan hote to aae din artiai kaaryakartaaon ko dhakke khaane nahin padate
 They do not have to travel around the Information Commissioners office for months by applying on the application
 kai baar lagata he ki i-garvanence ke naam par chand suvidhaayen uplabdh kara kar sansthaaon ko pehle se zyada aloktantric kiya ja rahaa he
 We have not started colliding with all these questions, we accept what is said from above as Prasad
 i-gavarnence se jitani javabdehi paidaa nahin hoti usase kahin zyaada system parde ke peeche chalaa jaataa he
 Because you get some convenience from sitting at home, you should get it but social relations with the institutions are ended
 aap sirf maang or aapurti ke bich ke upabhokta banakar rah jate hai
 It is not an online shopping system that money is given and bought
 yah sarkaar he
 You should know what the decision process is and who has benefited
 isliye suvidha or paardarshita main fark karnaa chahie
 Information alone is not the foundation of democracy
 asli soochna vahi nahin he, jo sarkaar apane faislon or aankadon ke rup main bataati he
 Through e-governance and mobile apps, the government wants to remove the counters of its institutions from its premises and put them in your pocket mobile
 line daftar main nahin he to kya hua, kisne kaha ki inke zariye line khatm ho gai he
 Try going to the airport or railway station
 passport aphis bhi jaakar dekh lijie
 It may be that old updates go down due to daily updates on Twitter
 isliye mobile ap main inhen ek jagah sankalit kiya ja saktaa he
 Every day in the new government, some website and app are launched
 ise is tarah se bhi dekha ja saktaa he ki soshal media main aae din nae nae madhyam ban rahe hai
 There is also competition between these mediums
 ek manch par aap khud ko saarvajinak banaate hai to duusare manch par dusron se alag kar khaas banaate hai
 Here the man is always trying to distinguish himself from the crowd
 sankhya kaa bhi khaas mahatv he
 The credibility of the number of social media is also doubtful, but the ability to doubt is not available to the common man
 phir bhi isaki sankhya ki kitne pholo kar rahe hai yaa kitne twit kiye gaye hai yah sab ek prabhaavshaalee chhavi ke madhyam to he hin
 The comments twitor par pehle se hi pradhanmantri vyakti ke rup main maujuud hai
 They also exist as an institution through the handle of the PMO
 ab ek nayaa manch aa gaya he pradhanmantri narendra modi mobile ap
 One might say that this too is a kind of individualism
 yah thodaa saral hoga kyonki vyaktvaad to he hi pehle se
 Maybe the rest of the ministers will also launch an app in their own name
 ho saktaa he ki na bhi karen
 App of ministries may come
 kulamilaakar soochnaaon kaa aisa gheraa banaaya jaataa he ki ek saamaanya naagarik ko usase baahar nikalne kaa mauka hi nahin milegaa
 He may not be able to see the change in the situation around him, but through these virtual information of the virtual world, he will be happy living in the confusion of a changed situation
 ham sabaki aadat hoti he
 We do not see what is happening here
 ham dekhnaa chaahate hai ki vahaan kya ho rahaa he
 Prime Minister is also a brand
 in sab madhyamon ke zariye ve apane brands ko alag-alag brands main badalte rahete hai
 They organize by different names
 soshal media kaa spes lagaataar bharta jaataa he
 The big brand constantly changes its place
 bich bich main nayaa hota rahata he
 There are many old products in the market itself, which do not know how many times have been launched and new
 pradhanmantri ek product bhi hai
 Therefore, new, fresh or already launched with strong tagline
 unki is urja kaa kaayal hum
 They neither exhaust themselves nor allow their brand to rest
 mobile ap main jo bhi soochna hogi wo sarkaar kii alag-alag bevesite or mantriyon-mantralayon ke twitor handle or fasebuk pej par hoti hi he
 The PMO also has its own website
 in madhyamon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie ki yahaan likhi gai baton kaa sansthaaon par kya asar hua or in sab upkarnon se sansthaaon ko lekar logon ke anubhav kis tarah se badale hai
 Not only the government, but the social media of all opposition leaders should also be studied
 tab pataa chalegaa ki ye saare madhyam logon ke bich apni maujuudagi kii ghanti bajaate rahane ke liye he yaa vaaki rojaanaa ban rahe janmaton ke anusaar, system main badlaav ke liye hai
 It should be seen whether it benefits the public or the leader
 akhbaar, tivi or naanaa prakaar ke vigyapanon ke bich soshal media ke ye upkaran ek or madhyam bhar hi hai
 In the absence of extensive research and understanding, it is difficult to say for sure
 magar in madhyamon main hone vaali samvaad prakriyaaon se guzarate hue lagata he ki ye paardarshee nahin hai
 The illusion of transparency is created
 aapako lagata he ki aap netaa ke sampark main hai, lekin jaise hi aap buniyadi sawaal karte hai, netaa usee tarah se chup ho jaataa he jaise pehle chup rahata tha
 In the case of Sushma Swaraj and Vasundhara Raje, people want to listen to the Prime Minister, but every morning one has to be satisfied with the tweet of pictures of his Yogasan
 unki mulakaaton or badhai sandesh ke twit to aa jate hai, magar yah nahin pataa chalata ki unki mulakaaton main kya hua
 For balance, you can say that the same situation is with Rahul Gandhi or other leaders
 bahut had tak patrakaron kaa bhi
 It is now more than ten years since the e-governance boom
 ab tak iskaa thos adhyayan ho janaa chahie tha ki kya vaaki i-gavarnence paardarshita he
 Has an institution's professional performance improved? i-garvanence se kuch maamalon main sthiti behatar to lagati he magar yah samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin he
 Passport Seva can be a successful example, but despite the railway ticket website, people do not believe that everything happens in a transparent way
 varshon se logon main railway ke tikat kii website ko lekar asantosh he
 Every railway budget has a number to launch to inform people, but this has neither affected the performance of the arrival of the train nor the availability of tickets nor travel experiences
 hamen yah sawaal poochna chahie ki agar i-garvanence paardarshita he to phir artiai kyon hai
 Why not every file is uploaded daily on the government website
 vibhageeya baithkon ke minutes website yaa mobile ap main kyon nahin hote hai
 If there was evidence of e-governance and mobile app transparency, then RTI activists do not have to attack every day
 unhen aavedan par aavedan lagaakar maheenon soochna ayuktaon ke daftar main chakkar nahin lagane padate
 Many times it seems that by providing few facilities in the name of e-governance, institutions are being undemocratic more than before
 hamane in sab sawaalon se takaraana shuru nahin kiya he, jo upar se kaha jaataa he ham use prasad ke rup main sweekaar kar lete hai
 The system goes behind the scenes more than any accountability is not created by e-governance
 kyonki aapako ghar baithne se kuch suvidha to hoti he, milani bhi chahie magar sansthaaon se saamaajik sambandh samaapt ho jaataa he
 You are just a consumer between supply and demand
 yah koi online shopping system nahin he ki paisa diya or kharid liya
 This is the government
 aapako jaananaa chahie ki faisle kii prakriya kya he or kin logon ko laabh hua he
 Therefore there should be a difference in convenience and transparency
 sirf soochna hi loktantr kii buniyaad nahin he
 The real information is not what the government tells as its decisions and figures
 i-gavarnence or mobile ap ke zariye sarkaar apni sansthaaon ke counter apane ahaate se hataakar aapaki jeb kii mobile main daal dena chaahati he
 If the line is not in the office, then what happened, who said that through them the line is over
 airport yaa railway stesan jaakar dekh lijie
 Go to passport office and see
 ye ho saktaa he ki twitor par rose apadet hone se puraani chizein neeche chali jaati hai
 So they can be compiled in one place in the mobile app
 nai sarkaar main aae din koi na koi website or ap launch hote rahete he
 It can also be seen in this way that the new mediums are becoming new mediums in social media
 in madhyamon ke bich pratiyogita bhi hoti he
 On one stage, you make yourself public and on the other stage you make yourself special by separating from others
 yahaan aadmi har vakt khud ko bheed se alag bataane kii koshish main rahata he
 The number also has special significance
 soshal madhyamon kii sankhya kii vishwaneeyata bhi sandigdh he par andeh karne kii kshamta aam jan main nahin hoti he
 Yet its number is how many are following or how many are tweeted, it is all through an impressive image
 tippaniyan There is already a Prime Minister on Twitter
 ve piemo ke handle ke zariye sanstha ke rup main bhi maujuud hai
 Now a new platform has come, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Mobile App
 koi kah saktaa he ki yah bhi ek kism kaa vyaktvaad he
 This will be a little easier because individualism is already there
 ho saktaa he ki baaki mantri bhi apane naam se ap launch karen
 You may not even
 mantralayon ke ap aa sakate hai
 Overall, such a circle of information is created that an ordinary citizen will not get a chance to get out of it
 wo apane aas-paas kii sthiti main bhale badlaav nahin dekh sakegaa, lekin abhaasi jagat kii in vaastavik soochnaaon ke zariye wo ek badale hue halaat ke bhram main jeeta hua khush rahegaa
 We all have a habit
 ham yah nahin dekhte ki yahaan kya ho rahaa he
 We want to see what is happening there
 pradhanmantri ek brands bhi hai
 Through all these mediums they keep changing their brand into different brand
 alag-alag naam se sangathit karte rahete hai
 Social media space is constantly filled
 bada brands lagaataar apni jagah badalata rahata he
 It keeps getting new from time to time
 bazaar main hi bahut puraane utpaada aise hai jo na jane kitni baar nayaa hokar launch ho chuke hai
 The Prime Minister is also a product
 isle liye nayaa, tazaa yaa pehle se bhi damdaar tagaline se launch hote rahete hai
 i am convinced of his energy
 ve na to khud thakte hai or na hi apane brands ko aaraam karne dete hai
 In the absence of extensive research and understanding, it is difficult to say for sure
 magar in madhyamon main hone vaali samvaad prakriyaaon se guzarate hue lagata he ki ye paardarshee nahin hai
 The illusion of transparency is created
 aapako lagata he ki aap netaa ke sampark main hai, lekin jaise hi aap buniyadi sawaal karte hai, netaa usee tarah se chup ho jaataa he jaise pehle chup rahata tha

 ham yah nahin dekhte ki yahaan kya ho rahaa he
 We want to see what is happening there
 pradhanmantri ek brands bhi hai
 Through all these mediums they keep changing their brand into different brand
 alag-alag naam se sangathit karte rahete hai
 Social media space is constantly filled
 bada brands lagaataar apni jagah badalata rahata he
 It keeps getting new from time to time
 bazaar main hi bahut puraane utpaada aise hai jo na jane kitni baar nayaa hokar launch ho chuke hai
 The Prime Minister is also a product
 isle liye nayaa, tazaa yaa pehle se bhi damdaar tagaline se launch hote rahete hai
 i am convinced of his energy
 ve na to khud thakte hai or na hi apane brands ko aaraam karne dete hai
 It is now more than ten years since the e-governance boom
 ab tak iskaa thos adhyayan ho janaa chahie tha ki kya vaaki i-gavarnence paardarshita he
 Has an institution's professional performance improved? i-garvanence se kuch maamalon main sthiti behatar to lagati he magar yah samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin he
 Passport Seva can be a successful example, but despite the railway ticket website, people do not believe that everything happens in a transparent way
 varshon se logon main railway ke tikat kii website ko lekar asantosh he
 Every railway budget has a number to launch to inform people, but this has neither affected the performance of the arrival of the train nor the availability of tickets nor travel experiences
 hamen yah sawaal poochna chahie ki agar i-garvanence paardarshita he to phir artiai kyon hai
 Why not every file is uploaded daily on the government website
 vibhageeya baithkon ke minutes website yaa mobile ap main kyon nahin hote hai
 If there was evidence of e-governance and mobile app transparency, then RTI activists do not have to attack every day
 unhen aavedan par aavedan lagaakar maheenon soochna ayuktaon ke daftar main chakkar nahin lagane padate
 Many times it seems that by providing few facilities in the name of e-governance, institutions are being undemocratic more than before
 hamane in sab sawaalon se takaraana shuru nahin kiya he, jo upar se kaha jaataa he ham use prasad ke rup main sweekaar kar lete hai
 The system goes behind the scenes more than any accountability is not created by e-governance
 kyonki aapako ghar baithne se kuch suvidha to hoti he, milani bhi chahie magar sansthaaon se saamaajik sambandh samaapt ho jaataa he
 You are just a consumer between supply and demand
 yah koi online shopping system nahin he ki paisa diya or kharid liya
 This is the government
 aapako jaananaa chahie ki faisle kii prakriya kya he or kin logon ko laabh hua he
 Therefore there should be a difference in convenience and transparency
 sirf soochna hi loktantr kii buniyaad nahin he
 The real information is not what the government tells as its decisions and figures
 i-gavarnence or mobile ap ke zariye sarkaar apni sansthaaon ke counter apane ahaate se hataakar aapaki jeb kii mobile main daal dena chaahati he
 If the line is not in the office, then what happened, who said that through them the line is over
 airport yaa railway stesan jaakar dekh lijie
 Go to passport office and see
 ye ho saktaa he ki twitor par rose apadet hone se puraani chizein neeche chali jaati hai
 So they can be compiled in one place in the mobile app
 nai sarkaar main aae din koi na koi website or ap launch hote rahete he
 It can also be seen in this way that the new mediums are becoming new mediums in social media
 in madhyamon ke bich pratiyogita bhi hoti he
 On one stage, you make yourself public and on the other stage you make yourself special by separating from others
 yahaan aadmi har vakt khud ko bheed se alag bataane kii koshish main rahata he
 The number also has special significance
 soshal madhyamon kii sankhya kii vishwaneeyata bhi sandigdh he par andeh karne kii kshamta aam jan main nahin hoti he
 Yet its number is how many are following or how many are tweeted, it is all through an impressive image
 tippaniyan There is already a Prime Minister on Twitter
 ve piemo ke handle ke zariye sanstha ke rup main bhi maujuud hai
 Now a new platform has come, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Mobile App
 koi kah saktaa he ki yah bhi ek kism kaa vyaktvaad he
 This will be a little easier because individualism is already there
 ho saktaa he ki baaki mantri bhi apane naam se ap launch karen
 You may not even
 mantralayon ke ap aa sakate hai
 Overall, such a circle of information is created that an ordinary citizen will not get a chance to get out of it
 wo apane aas-paas kii sthiti main bhale badlaav nahin dekh sakegaa, lekin abhaasi jagat kii in vaastavik soochnaaon ke zariye wo ek badale hue halaat ke bhram main jeeta hua khush rahegaa

 isle liye nayaa, tazaa yaa pehle se bhi damdaar tagaline se launch hote rahete hai
 i am convinced of his energy
 ve na to khud thakte hai or na hi apane brands ko aaraam karne dete hai
 We should ask the question that if there is e-governance transparency then why are rtis
 kyon nahin har file rozaana sarkaar kii website par aplod kar di jaati he
 Why are the minutes of departmental meetings not on the website or mobile app
 i-gavarnence or mobile ap paardarshita ke pramaan hote to aae din artiai kaaryakartaaon ko dhakke khaane nahin padate
 They do not have to travel around the Information Commissioners office for months by applying on the application
 kai baar lagata he ki i-garvanence ke naam par chand suvidhaayen uplabdh kara kar sansthaaon ko pehle se zyada aloktantric kiya ja rahaa he
 We have not started colliding with all these questions, we accept what is said from above as Prasad
 i-gavarnence se jitani javabdehi paidaa nahin hoti usase kahin zyaada system parde ke peeche chalaa jaataa he
 Because you get some convenience from sitting at home, you should get it but social relations with the institutions are ended
 aap sirf maang or aapurti ke bich ke upabhokta banakar rah jate hai
 It is not an online shopping system that money is given and bought
 yah sarkaar he
 You should know what the decision process is and who has benefited
 isliye suvidha or paardarshita main fark karnaa chahie
 Information alone is not the foundation of democracy
 asli soochna vahi nahin he, jo sarkaar apane faislon or aankadon ke rup main bataati he
 Through e-governance and mobile apps, the government wants to remove the counters of its institutions from its premises and put them in your pocket mobile
 line daftar main nahin he to kya hua, kisne kaha ki inke zariye line khatm ho gai he
 Try going to the airport or railway station
 passport aphis bhi jaakar dekh lijie
 It may be that old updates go down due to daily updates on Twitter
 isliye mobile ap main inhen ek jagah sankalit kiya ja saktaa he
 Every day in the new government, some website and app are launched
 ise is tarah se bhi dekha ja saktaa he ki soshal media main aae din nae nae madhyam ban rahe hai
 There is also competition between these mediums
 ek manch par aap khud ko saarvajinak banaate hai to duusare manch par dusron se alag kar khaas banaate hai
 Here the man is always trying to distinguish himself from the crowd
 sankhya kaa bhi khaas mahatv he
 The credibility of the number of social media is also doubtful, but the ability to doubt is not available to the common man
 phir bhi isaki sankhya ki kitne pholo kar rahe hai yaa kitne twit kiye gaye hai yah sab ek prabhaavshaalee chhavi ke madhyam to he hin
 The comments twitor par pehle se hi pradhanmantri vyakti ke rup main maujuud hai
 They also exist as an institution through the handle of the PMO
 ab ek nayaa manch aa gaya he pradhanmantri narendra modi mobile ap
 One might say that this too is a kind of individualism
 yah thodaa saral hoga kyonki vyaktvaad to he hi pehle se
 Maybe the rest of the ministers will also launch an app in their own name
 ho saktaa he ki na bhi karen
 App of ministries may come
 kulamilaakar soochnaaon kaa aisa gheraa banaaya jaataa he ki ek saamaanya naagarik ko usase baahar nikalne kaa mauka hi nahin milegaa
 He may not be able to see the change in the situation around him, but through these virtual information of the virtual world, he will be happy living in the confusion of a changed situation
 ham sabaki aadat hoti he
 We do not see what is happening here
 ham dekhnaa chaahate hai ki vahaan kya ho rahaa he
 Prime Minister is also a brand

 Often amidst the serenity of a peacock-torn campus, the 60-year-old vice-chancellor of Hyderabad Central University, Professor Ramakrishna Ramaswamy's beautifully artistic interest is the center of many activities ranging from planning for upcoming academic sessions to getting in touch via Facebook
 
 ve hameshaa apana fasebuk account khulaa rakhte hai
 His friends on Facebook have more than 2,000 students in his list
 ve kehete hai, ''yah chaatro se jude rahane or unke liye uplabdh rahane kaa anokhaa tarika he
 Since the inception of Hyderabad University or Hyderabad Central University (HCU) in 1974, it has attracted the attention of students from home and abroad due to its dedication to the philosophy and research of its 'student-first (student at the forefront)'
 The center remains
 2011 main vaais-chancelar bane ramasvami chaatro kaa aadhaar vyapak karne ke dirghakaalin lakshya saadhane main lage hai
 He says, "we have some unusual facilities here and our faculty is better in the country
" meraa lakshya har saal zyada se zyada chaatro ko yah uplabdh karana he
 "ramaswamy also agrees that the most important thing is to provide better basic facilities
 ve kehete hai, ''iske liye hamen apni maujuuda suvidhaon ko badhaane par jor dena hoga, kakshaon ko behatar bananaa hoga or chaatro ko awaas kii behatar suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karaani hogi
 i believe that the spread of knowledge can only take place in an environment where the students are motivated and who are suitable for studies
 ”pichley saal ek anokhaa kirtiman bhi hasil hua
 The University Grants Commission (UGC) conferred upon him the status of Distinguished University from the University, with its prospects of excellence
 princeton uniwarsity se chemistry main piechdi praapt vaais-chancelar kaa maananaa he ki yah vishvavidhyalay ke chaatro or faikalti ke vishisht research work kii vajah se hi he
 For instance, in Ramaswamy's own words, "during his Integrated Masters course of Inspection Reddy, two research papers in the field of optics were a unique opportunity to be featured in prestigious international journals
" iske alaava vishvavidhyalay pichley academik satr main teen isiesasar-amartya sen puraskaron se bhi surkhiyon main rahaa
 Among them, an alumnus, Dr
 kalpana kannabiran aajkal samaaj vikaas parishad kii diarector hai
 The second Dr
 vanshi vakulabharanam skool of iconomics main associat professor hai or tisare purv faikalti sadsy surinder jodhaka hai
 "this university offers many specialized courses of education
 masalan, pichley saal shuru hue bal naatak or saarvajanik swasthya ke alaava sanskrit computer bhashaa vigyaan, vyaavhaarik vigyaan or prithvi vigyaan jaise vishyon main kai course hai
 Apart from these, there are many courses of social relevance
 jaise theatre vibhaag main shuru hui theatre outrich unit main saansthanik maapdandon se alag aisi natya kala sikhaai jaati he jisamen academik or natyakala ke bich gyaan or kaushal kaa talmail hota he
 Ramaswamy is also a blogger and hcurocks his blog
 wordpress
 com writes on everything from prestigious awards to faculty members to popular serials like Game of Thrones
 vaais-chancelar ke blog main likhe gaye vishyon par charchaa 2,000 acre main faile campus main khub hoti he
 Ramaswamy is also a nature lover, so always takes care of the need to save the natural heritage of the university
 'vishvavidhyalay ke isro aadhaarit nakshe ke mutabik, kareeb 600 acre bhoomi to sangrakshit bhoomi hi he jisamen jalashay or sadiyon puraani chattaane, anek tarah ke ped-paudhe or kareeb 45 vibhinn prajati ke pakshiyon kaa baseraa he
 a lake has also been enlarged by building a dam, where the students take a stroll
 campus ke bade hisse main ham kisi tarah ke nirmaan kii ijaajat nahin dete kyonki ise prakritik sangrakshan ke liye choda gaya he
 Thus the university is also an important biodiversity protected area of hyderabad
 ”aisi bahut-si pahal kii ja chuki hai jo agle kuch saal main kai kirtiman sthapit karne kaa jariya ban sakati hai
 "much will depend on the policies and grants of the new government
" abhi ye shuruaati din hai or hamen dekhne ke liye kuch intjaar karnaa padegaa ki agle kuch maheene main sthitiyaan kya aakaar leti hai
 "what Says vice-chancellor Ramakrishna Ramaswamy" This is a perfect place for expectations, high-level research work and a wide range of possibilities "my association with the University of Hyderabad has been somewhat odd since at least 30 years ago
 yaheen mujhe 1982 main sthaayee naukari kii peshkash kii gai thi
 i did not accept him then
 jaahir he, maine sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha ki ek din main yahaan vaais-chancelar banakar lautoonga
 i used to come to the university often
 mujhe hameshaa yah vishvavidhyalay anokhaa laga he
 It is the home of aspiration, high-level research work and many possibilities
 yah is myne main bhi vishisht he kyonki uttar bharat ke baahar pehla mukhya kendriya vishvavidhyalay he
 It has been three years since i became vice-chancellor and till now it has been unmatched because many important research work has been done and many are going on
 vishvavidhyalay do nobel puraskaar praat shakhsiyaton iconomics main joseph stiglitz or chemistry main rudolph marcus ko 2012-13 ke acadmic seshan main maanad doctoret oopaadhi dekar vaaki sammanit hua he
 i am committed to preserving the natural beauty of the campus and enjoy it
 yahaan hona hi ek uplabdhi he

 vidaa ho rahe saal main donon geeton or rupahale parde par in geeton par dance karne vaali abhinetriyon ke bich bhi shreshthata kii jang jari he
 According to the result of an online voting 'munni Badnaam'
 
 
 ' geet ' shila kii javaani
 
 
 'proved to be heavy
 haalanki 'shila kii javaani' ke kadradaan bhi zyada peeche nahin rahe
 The question for voting was asked, 'which of these actresses did you like the item song the most?' Only three choices were made - Katrina Kaif, Malaika Arora Khan and Sameera Reddy
 darasal yahaan muqabla sirf do ke bich hi sabit hua
 The role of the third was just like a candidate cutting votes
 voting main bhaag lene vaale kareeb 55 fisadi logon ne 'munni badnaam
 
 
 Voted in favor of Malaika Arora Khan, who danced on '
 'shila kii javaani
 
 
 'but 39 percent people liked Katrina Kaif, who pulled her back
 samira reddy ko mahaj saadhe paanch pratishat vot se hi santosh karnaa padaa or unki jamaanat jabt hoti dikhi
 Many things made the 'munni' pan in this race
 is gane ke bol aise hai, jo ekadam aasaani se logon kii jubaan par chadh jate hai
 It is here that the word 'darling' used in it does not knock anyone, because Hindi has absorbed it within decades ago
 saath hi isamen ek aise dard nivarak balm ke naam kaa bhi istemaal kiya gaya he, jo ghar-ghar istemaal hota he
 In the early stages, this balm also increased the popularity of the song by creating controversy
 duusari ore 'shila kii javaani
 
 
 The song lagged behind 'munni' despite Katrina's wonderful dance
 isamen angreji ke shabdon kaa istemaal he, jo 'bathroom singron' kii jubaan par aasaani se nahin chadh pate
 It is easy to reach this conclusion with the fact that the use of flashy clothes and the word 'seksi' is not enough for popularity
 logon ko lubhaane ke liye 'amiyaan' jaise aam shabdon se bhi kareebi badhaani padati he
 One question still remains whether these songs created more entertainment or added to the suffering of 'sheela' and 'munni', who have settled in civil society
 in geeton ne manchalon ko fikrebaaji kaa ek or mauka muhaiyaa karaayaa, jisaki baangi aae din khabaron main mil jaaya karti he
 Till now, 'munna' or 'munni' was a name apart from a child's call to love, but now Surat has changed
 ab shaayad hi koi is makasad se kisi ko 'munni' pukaare paae, kyonki munni par naahak badanaami kaa saaya mandaraane kaa dar jo he
 While the talk of 'sheela' being a 'sexie', it only shows that 'elevated picture' of the changing society, who unknowingly raises the flag to free herself from the clutches of sexual frustration and to openly accept the discussion on sex
 Looking towards the future with great enthusiasm ek puraani lokokti he ki dosti main utaar-chadhaav aate rahete he or aapako apane dost ko unchaaiyon par dekh khud ke peeche hone kaa afsos nahin karnaa chahie
 Actress Asin Thottumkal believes the same
 asin ne utivi stars ke sho 'superstar centa' main do doston kaa jhagada sulajhaate hue khulaasa kiya ki unke najdiki dost bollywood main unki safalataa se kabhi-kabhi asuraksha mahasoos karte hai
 Actress Asin of the film 'ghajini' has a group of six-seven girls among her friends
 asin ke mata-pita ke liye ye ladkiyaan unki betiyon kii tarah hai
 They are very close to each other but Asin is not able to meet her much due to her film commitments and because of this she feels insecure
 is vajah se kai baar unke bich galatchhemiyaan ban jaati hai lekin asin kahati hai ki vah maamle ke haath se nikalne se pehle hi maamla sulajhaa leti hai
 She admits that at times, she has apologized to friends even though there is no fault of her own
 'superstar centa' kaa yah bhaag ravivaar ko prasaarit hoga

 But his wish was fulfilled on Tuesday, when he wore the uniform of Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), reached the police headquarters, and also visited the police station sitting in the police jeep
 
 
 darasal uskaa yah khwab puraa karne ke liye 'mek e vish foundation' ne police adhikariyon se baatcheet kii thi, or sari baat sunne ke baad ahmedabad police vibhaag ne puraa sahyog diya, jisase kuch der ke liye hi sahi, duniya se vidaa hone se pehle ek bachche kaa sapana puraa ho paaya

 modi sarkaar ke chaar saal puure ho gaye hai
 Now the government is moving towards the next general election
 aise main sarkaar ke vaadon ko yaad karnaa bhi laazmi ho jaataa he
 There was an important promise in these promises, the solution of the Naxalite problem
 lekin is mudde par modi sarkaar kahin na kahin apane vaade se dur najar aati he
 In the last four years, if the security forces continued to act in the Naxal-affected areas, then the Naxalites also did not lag behind
 unhone bhi suraksha balon or police ke javaanon ko apana nishaanaa banaaya
 When the government changed after May 2014, the Nizam also changed
 naksalwad ko lekar sarkaar ne jo vaade chunaav ke dauraan kiye the
 Far from being talked about, they did not see any concrete steps to be taken in this direction
 haalanki sarkaar kii taraf se grahamantri lagaataar naksaliyon ke khatme kii baat karte rahe
 If we look at the figures, in total 126 districts were declared by the Ministry of Home Affairs as Naxalite affected
 un sabhi jilon main naksal samasya se nipatane ke liye centre ne bajet main vishesh praavdhaan kiya
 Assuming the claims of the government, 44 districts of the affected districts were freed from the problem of Naxalism
 inamen 32 janapad to aise hai, jahaan pichley kuch saalon main naksali hamale nahin hue
 But there are still 30 districts, where the Naxalites are very strong and they are continuing their mission
 grih mantralay ke aankadon par najar daalen to varsh 2013 ke mukaable varsh 2017 main naksali hamalon main 35 fisadi kii kami ai he
 But there were some attacks which shook the entire government
 surakshabalon ke kai jawan shahid ho gaye
 Odisha, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar are among the states facing the naxal problem, but Chhattisgarh tops the list as a stronghold of Naxalites

 shaheedon main ek dipti commandent or asistent commandent bhi shaamil the
 About one thousand Naxalites carried out that attack

 The Maoists also looted five INSAS rifles and two ak-47s along with their mobiles, wireless sets from the jawans
 kul milakar pichley chaar saalon main agar modi sarkaar naksaliyon ke khilaaf uthaae kadamon ko lekar apni peeth thapthapa rahi he, to uparokt ghatnaon se pataa chalata he ki sarkaar kai morchon par vifal bhi rahi
 In such a situation, it can be said that the government's claims about the problems of Naxalism appear weak

 vishesh aarthik kshetra (sanshodhan) vidheyak 2019 pichley hafte sansad main paas ho gaya
 The Bill allows that a 'trust or an institution' may establish its own unit in the Special Economic Zone (SEZ)
 iskaa makasad nivesh badhanaa, vyapak aarthik gatividhiyon ke jariye rojgaar badhanaa ore buniyadi dhaancha kshetra main sudhaar laana he
 What does the amendment say? This bill replaces the ordinance of March, 2019 through which the SEZ Act of 2005 was amended to add two categories - 'trust or any institution, or notified by the Central Government'
 ab ye do shreniyan bhi un sansthaaon main shaamil hai jo vishesh aarthik kshetra main ikai lagane kii yogyata rakhti hai
 This was done by amending the interpretation mentioned in the Basic Law in which a 'person' qualification is prescribed for permission to place a unit in a special economic zone
 iske mutabik, koi 'vyakti' chaahe bhartiya ho yaa bharat se baahar kaa ho, kooparative so city, company jo ki chaahe bhartiya ho yaa bharat se baahar kii ho, form, stha neey nikaay yaa agency, nijee swaamitv vaale aphis yaa branch, association aadi iske liye yogya hai
 The Bill states that trusts have the ability to set up units in SEZ, in addition to other entities can also be added through government notification, if required, without amending the law
 nivesh or rojgaar ko sanjivanivanijya evam udyog mantri piyush goyal ne vidheyak par charchaa ke dauraan rajyasabha main bataaya ki sarkaar ko pratishthit companiyon ke aath treston ke aavedan mili hai jinka kul nivesh 8000 karod he
 However, what kind of trusts they have, what their economic activities are, is not clear
 vipaksh ne sanshodhan ko lekar andeh vyakt kiya to goyal ne sadan ko bataaya ki march, 2019 tak SEZ se 20 lakh naukariyaan utpann hui hai, 5 lakh karod kaa nivesh aayaa he or saat lakh karod kaa niryaat hua he
 The Trust's Growing Prospects According to Trust Affairs Specialist and Charter Accountant of Delhi Jagdeep Gautam, the bill has opened up possibilities for all types of trusts to run from the Special Economic Zones
 ye trust swasthya, shiksha, kaushal or jeevika sambandhi gatividhiyon se lekar utpaadan yaa finance se sambandhit ho sakate hai
 Vishnu Jain, a knowledgeable and advocate of SEZ cases, illustrates how this amendment will increase exports
 ve kehete hai ki jaise baba ramdev kaa patan jali yogapith ek trust he jo haridwar se chalata he
 Now it can be operated from Visakhapatnam SEZ and can send its products out of Ayurvedic medicines, cosmetics, food products etc
 with the help of port facilities
 'bijness trust' ko protsaahanbijness trust bharat main 2014 se vajood main aae hai
 Business trust is very important from the point of view of a competent beneficiary
 bijness trust ko inakam tex act ke tahat vyakhyayit kiya gaya he
 Business trusts can be of the following types - infrastructure investment trusts, real estate investment trusts, entities that are recognized by the stock exchange and need to be notified or which have been notified by the government
 ye aise trust hai jo mutual fund kii tarah real estate or buniyadi dhaanche se sambandhit pariyojnaon se sidhe paisa uthaate hai
 They raise financial resources from the private sector for infrastructure development
 haalanki, bharat main philhal yah apane shuruaati daur main he
 Gautam says that in 2016, the Security and Exchange Board of India gave permission to run the Business Trust from SEZ
 SEZ act 2005 main maujuuda sanshodhan se raah or aasaan ho jaaegi
 Trusts are extremely common as an executive body in the financial sector, so trusts can be the biggest beneficiaries of this amendment
 SEZ main khaali jameen kaa istemaalyah sanshodhan SEZ main khaali jagahon ke upyog ko bhi badhaava degaa
 According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 40 percent of notified sezs are lying idle and more than 50 percent of the notified land for SEZ is lying vacant
 rajyasabha main die apane jawaab main mantri ne bataaya ki agast, 2018 tak adhishuchet 373 SEZ main se 150 niskriy hai or 45,711
 64 hectares (457 sq km)
 ) adhishuchet ilaake main se 23,779
 19 ha (237
 8 varg kimi
 ) The land is lying vacant
 SEZ main trust ko ikaiyaan sthapit karne anumati dene se khaali padi jameenon kaa rachanaatmak upyog kiya ja sakegaa
 SEZ has contributed significantly to the economy
 jaisaa ki vidheyak pesh karte hue piyush goyal ne rajyasabha main bataaya ki SEZ se desh main 20 lakh naukariyaan paidaa hui hai or 5 lakh karod kaa nivesh aayaa he
 Now, as the Bill widens its scope, both investment and employment will be encouraged

 Eventually the police retreated seeing the controversy escalate

 The Modi government has completed four years at the Center since it won a majority in the Lok Sabha in May 2014
 is dauraan bharat sarkaar kaa apane hi ek ang nyaaypalika se takaraav bhi dekhne ko mila
 The Modi government has always been in the spotlight regarding its relationship with the judiciary
 zyaadaatar samay sarkaar or nyaaypalika main takaraav kii surat dekhne ko mili
 In India, the judiciary is responsible for determining the interpretation of the Constitution and the sharing of powers, so it is natural for the top judiciary to have a relationship with the government
 haalanki, is baar yah anban zyada hi dekhne ko mili
 Law experts believe that one of the reasons is that this time the Bharatiya Janata Party, the main party of the ruling coalition at the Center, was successful in securing majority on its own
 aise main uske samaksh gathbandhan kii sharten yaa majaburiyaan nahin thim
 There have been several occasions when disagreements were seen between the government and the judiciary
 aaie jaanate hai in chaar saalon main donon ke sambandhon main kaise utaar-chadhaav aayaa
 Finance Minister and Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court Arun Jaitley had said in the Rajya Sabha on 11 May 2016, 'india's judiciary is continuously violating the powers of legislature and executive and now the center has only the right to budget and finance
 went
 kadam-dar-kadam vidhayika kii eent se eent nikaali ja rahi he
 This statement of the Finance Minister tells the story of the confrontation between the Republic of India and the judiciary
 vah jiesti par centre or rajyon ke bich ai asahmati ko dur karne ke liye ek sanstha ke gathan kii maang par bol rahe the
 The conflict has been in place since the old times, in India, the topmost structure of the judiciary has been considered free from government pressure
 yahaan se pradhanmantri tak ke khilaaf faisle aae hai
 In 1975, Allahabad High Court converted the victory of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in defeat in Uttar Pradesh vs Raj Narayan case and prohibited her from contesting elections for six years

 The Modi government tried to replace it with the National Judicial Appointment Commission ie NJAC
 supreme court kii paanch jajon kii bench ne 2015 main is prastaav ko 4-1 se thukraa diya
 According to experts, through NJAC, the government wanted to keep the command of the Supreme Court and High Court from the judiciary
 iske baad sarkaar or nyaaypalika main jajon kii bhartee ko lekar anban dekhne ko mili
 Differences regarding the appointment of judges On 6 April 2015, PM Narendra Modi's statement at a conference of Chief Ministers and Chief Justices showed the seriousness of the confrontation between the judiciary and the government
 is sammelan main pradhanmantri ne desh ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke nazariye se manch se hi asahmati jataai
 The then Chief Justice TS Thakur had mentioned the almost crying cases pending and the lack of judges in the judiciary
 iske baad manch par aae piem ne kaha ki lambit keson kii vajah yah he ki adaalatein kamjor kanoonon kii vyakhya karne main hi saalon kaa samay laga detii hai
 Modi accused the judiciary of saying, "the courts should avoid hearing the verdicts, influenced by the concepts created by the Five Star activists
" ' iske baad bhi chif justise ties thakur ne 2 jajon ke transfar par naaraaz hokar kaha tha ki vah sambandhit jajon se nyaayik kaam waapas le lenge
 Apart from this, he even threatened to give a judicial order for the appointment of judges and to run a contempt case against the PMO and the officials of the Law Ministry

 Angered by this, Subramaniam withdrew his application
 tab supreme court garmiyon kii chhuttiyon main band tha
 Frustrated with this, the then CJI RM Lodha had said that Subramaniam should have waited for the Supreme Court to open
 kyonki agar collegium phir subramanyam kaa naam sarkaar ke paas bhej detaa to sarkaar ko yah manjuur karnaa padataa
 Let me tell you that Subramaniam was a friend of justice in the Sohrabuddin encounter case and he had made serious allegations against the then Narendra Modi's Gujarat government with new evidence
 iske baad supreme court ne maamle main sibiai jaanch ke aadesh die the
 President's rule in uttarakhand-arunachal The central government received another setback from the Supreme Court in the case of imposition of President's rule in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh
 donon rajyon main congress kii sarkarein thim, jahaan sarkaar ko alpamat main laakar raashtrapati shashan laga diya gaya
 When two such cases came up within three months, the Supreme Court commented on the Governor that he should remember that he is not the elected representative of the public
 isliye vah mukhyamantri or unke mantriyon kii council se salaah ke bina satta apane haath main nahin le sakate hai
 At the same time, the court made it clear that if the government is in a minority then the governor should send the report to the President after conducting floor test
 kisi bhi surat main rajyapal ko mukhyamantri kii salaah leni hi hogi
 The court made these comments in the July 2016 case of Arunachal Pradesh
 bisisiai banaam supreme courtbisisiai ke sanchaalan main supreme court ke hastkshep ko bhi sarkaar or nyaaypalika ke takaraav main shumaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The Supreme Court reprimanded this top cricketing body of India for implementing the recommendations of the committee headed by former CJI Justice Lodha in the BCCI and said, "get better, otherwise we will improve you
" ' court ne bijepi ke netaa anuraag thakur par nyaayik sudhaar main rode atakane par unhen jail bhejne kii chetavanee di, tab jaakar thakur ne bisisiai adhyaksh kaa pad choda
 Apart from this, the appointment of CBI Director Rakesh Asthana was also challenged in the Supreme Court

 Justice Jasti Chelameswar, Justice Ranjan Gogai, Justice Madan Lokur and Justice Kurian Joseph held press conferences and questioned the administrative activities of CJI Deepak Mishra
 unhone kaha ki supreme court main jo galat ho rahaa he, use bataanaa unki jimmedaari he

 This was also cited as the reason for the judges' displeasure
 chaar jajon ne apni chitthee main bhi likhaa ki kai maukon par sijeai ne roster banane ke dauraan bench kaa nirdhaaran apni pasand or ataarkik dhang se kiya
 In the case of Justice Joseph, in the year 2018, there were many cases of tension between the Modi government and the judiciary
 sabase taaja maamla uttarakhand hai court ke chif justise keem joseph kii supreme court main niyukti kaa he
 Justice Joseph's name was sent to the Central Government by the Collegium, but the Center returned the name for reconsideration citing a violation of seniority
 aapako bataa den ki uttarakhand main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke maamle main centre sarkaar ko justise joseph kii bench ke faisle se jhatka laga tha
 It is also believed to be one of the reasons for this decision of the Center
 karnataka ke rajyapal kaa maamlakarnataka main may 2018 main hue 222 vidhansabha siton ke liye chunaavon main rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne sabase badi party bijepi (104 seat) ke paas bahumat se kam aankade hone par unhen mukhyamantri pad ke liye shapath dilaa di or bahumat pareekshan ke liye 15 din kaa samay de diya
 The Supreme Court not only reduced the 15-day period to 24 hours, but also accepted the plea that the largest party or post poll alliance lagged behind the majority figure (congress-78 seats and JDAS-37 seats in the Karnataka case)
 Who should get a chance to form a government first
 yani is maamle main bhi rajyapal kii bhoomika kii supreme court samiksha kar saktaa he
 This case is also an example of a Nyapalika vs Central government confrontation due to the BJP having a government at the Center

 com / vf37otw13n— Mouni Roy (@roymouni)december 26, 2018view this post on instagramthe last weeks i felt like a child again
 
 
 a punished one 🙈 i was not allowed to go out of the house for many days, to interact with other "kids", I've been told to be a good girl, to take my medicines every day and to keep a distance from crowded places
 Not that funny, I’ve got a contagious viral which kept me isolated in the house 🤦🏼♀️🙈😨 😂 i hvn’t got it when i was a child so later on it just skipped my mind to protect myself against it
 These days we have vaccination against many of the contagious viral infections and not only
 Now I’m done with it, my health is fine, I’ve recovered but i regret i haven’t taken it at the right time
 Lesson learned, now i will take all the required vaccinations to protect myself and i thought I'd make u aware of it so that u stay safe and healthy
 Check your health, have vit c and take the correct vaccinations if u feel is right for u!

 aajkal aap log tivi main khub dekhte or sunate honge ki har doosraa ankar or reporter bas yahi bolta dikhataa he ki 'is mudde par raajnneeti ho rahi he
 ' isse pehle main aage badhun ye bataanaa zaruri he ki is lekh main ghatnaon yaa event kaa zikr keval apni baat bataane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he na ki kisi ko doshi yaa zimmedaar tehraane ke liye
 Delhi and nowadays also cover its politics, in such a situation, when the current dispute or the battle is going on in the center and the state government, then i met a senior TV reporter at Parliament House one day
 jab koi senior miltaa he to meri aadat hoti he ki usase kisi maujuuda charchit mudde par uski raay jaanakar charchaa karun
 The advantage of this is that the scope of your thinking increases and you move towards going deeper into that issue and anyway, it is said that the knowledge taken and the donation given do not go in vain
 zaahir he ki main jaise hi unase mila to charchaa dilli kii raajnneeti or modi-kejariwal sarkaar ke takaraav kii shuru hui
 Meanwhile, i anxiously asked the senior reporter, what is your opinion on the current controversy? He said that i do not know everything else, but Kejriwal is doing politics
 maine bolaa ki are vah to sabko pataa he, netaa he to raajnneeti karegaa hi, lekin aap ye to bataao ki jo maang kejariwal kar rahe hai yaa jo daleel modi sarkaar ke hawaale se di ja rahi he isamen kiskaa tark or zamin majboot he? ye main aapse samajhnaa chahta hum
 He said that i do not know, but Kejriwal is doing politics
 ye sunakar jo mere man main aayaa vah main aage bataaungaa, lekin maine unase or baat karke na to unka samay jaaya kiya or na apana or ham donon apane apane kaam par chal pade
 Another issue that was still prevalent in Delhi was the municipal strike, due to which Delhi was turned into a garbage dump
 maine is mudde par jitani story,aadhe ghante yaa ek ghante ke lambey kaarykram dekhe sabhi main bas yahi dikhaa ki 'dilli kaa hua kooda' dilli main is gandagi kaa zimmedaar koun?' 'kya bijepi-aap kar rahi hai kooday kii raajnneeti?' yaa phir 'congress ne lagaae bijepi-aap par raajnneeti ke aarope' For the whole 10-12 days, there was a strike in the Municipal Corporation in Delhi and a lot of filth was spread in Delhi, but the responsibility of this could not be decided on anyone
 are bhai sidhaa bataao na ki iskaa zimmedaar koun he, vah bijepi jo nagar nigam par raaj karti he jis par nigam ko chalaane kaa zimmaa he yaa phir vah 'aap' jo dilli par raaj karti he, jis par dilli sarkaar ko chalaane kaa jimmaa he
 Let us also accept a little technical issue here and there, due to which one cannot be blamed, but still there will be one who will be more responsible for this mess
 par kahin koi zimmedaari kaa ata-pataa hi nahin
 The program of the debate also gave the same findings in an hour, giving a 2-minute story of the reporter, and in the debate also, whether the leaders of any party or journalists who are called as experts, all of them were saying this
 That politics is happening
 wo jo upar senior reporter mujhe kah rahe the ki kejariwal raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 When i listened to them, i remembered one thing of my senior colleague and columnist of Hindi journalism, Ravish Kumar, said 2 years ago
 asal main un dinon chal rahe ek virodh pradarshan ke silsile main mujhe bataa rahe the
 The case was about the rape of a 5-year-old girl and the police were accused of not registering a case, about which 'AAP' and BJP were demonstrating and reports were being made that 'AAP' and BJP politics on the issue Is doing
 to ye sab dekhte hue or dhyaan main rakhte ham baat kar rahe the to raveesh kumaar ne mujhe kaha ki sharad ye bahut hi 'satahi' patrakarita he
 Hey brother, this is the work of these people, if they protest, they will do their work, so what is the point of saying this? Go deep and report is baatcheet ke aadhaar par meri samaj bani ki kisi mudde par agar polytical party kuch kar rahi he to yah kah dena ki raajnneeti ho rahi he, ye sabakaa koi matlab nahin he
 Hey brother, the political party has become for politics
 netaa raajnneeti nahin karegaa to kya pravachan degaa? yaa pithagoras kii theoram par apane suvichaar vyakt karegaa? The point to understand is that any issue is a different thing and what the political party is doing or saying on it is a different thing
 or donon ko alag tarah se tavajjo di jaani chahie, lekin aaj ho kya rahaa he? aaj ho ye rahaa he ki mudde to keval naam ke hote hai or asli dhyaan us par na hokar tavajjo to keval raajnneeti par hota he
 Our focus is more on politics, but they say that these parties are doing politics
 har netaa yaa polytical party ko haq he ki wo apane hisaab se samaaj or kanoon se sweekrut daayre main rahakar apane mudde uthaaye apni raajnneeti kare kyonki aam janata ko bhi haq he wo kisi bhi party ko chune yaa khaarij kar de or yahi to loktantr hota he
 The comments or hamaara kaam ye hona chahie ki ham janata ko bataaen ki mudda ye he, isamen ye tathy hai yaa aankade hai or phir bataaen ki ye is mudde par ho rahi raajnneeti he
 To just say that politics is happening on this issue, according to me, this is the easiest job in the world
 isse pehle main aage badhun ye bataanaa zaruri he ki is lekh main ghatnaon yaa event kaa zikr keval apni baat bataane ke liye kiya ja rahaa he na ki kisi ko doshi yaa zimmedaar tehraane ke liye

 dilli or aajkal to isaki raajnneeti ko bhi cover karata hum aise main jab maujuuda vivaad yaa yun kahen ladaai centre or rajya sarkaar main adhikaar ko lekar chal rahi he to aise main ek din main sansad bhawan par ek varisht tivi reporter se mila
 When i meet a senior, it is my habit to discuss and discuss his current issues with him
 isse phayda ye hota he ki aapaki soch kaa dayera badhata he or aap us mudde kii gaharaai main jane kii disha main aage badhate hai or vaise bhi kehete hai na liya hua gyaan or diya hua daan vyarth nahin jaataa
 It is obvious that as soon as i met him, the discussion started between the politics of Delhi and the modi-kejriwal government
 is bich maine badi utsukata se un senior reporter se poocha ki aapaki kya raay he, maujuuda vivaad par? vah bole mujhe baaki sab to nahin pataa, lekin kejariwal raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 i said that everyone knows that he is a politician, he will do politics, but you tell me, whose argument and ground is strong in the demand that is being given by Kejriwal or the plea given by the Modi government? i want to understand this with you
 vah bole ki ye mujhe pataa nahin, lekin kejariwal raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 After hearing this, what will come in my mind, i will tell you further, but i did not waste their time talking to them and neither myself nor we both went on our own work
 ek doosraa mudda jo abhi dilli main chaaya hua tha nagar nigam kii hadtaal kaa, jiske kaaran dilli kooday ke dher main badal gai thi
 In all the stories, half-hour or one-hour-long programs i have seen on this issue, all of them have shown that who is responsible for this mess in Delhi? 'BJP - Are you doing garbage politics?' Or 'congress accuses BJP-AAP of politics' puure 10-12 din dilli main nagar nigam main hadtaal hui or dilli main khub gandagi faili, lekin isaki zimmedaari hi kisi par tay nahin ho pai
 Hey brother, don't tell me directly who is responsible for it, the BJP that rules the municipal corporation, which is responsible for running the corporation or the 'AAP' that rules Delhi, which is responsible for running the Delhi government
 
 chaliye thodaa bahut idhar-udhar or technical ishyu bhi maan len, jiske kaaran kisi ek par zimmedaari nahin daali ja sakati, lekin phir bhi koi ek to hoga, jo is gandagi ke liye zyaada zimmedaar hoga? But there is no sign of responsibility anywhere
 dibet ke program ne bhi ek ghante main vahi nishkarsh die, jo reporter kii 2 minute kii story de rahi thi or dibet main bhi chaahe kisi party ke netaa hon yaa patrkaar jo export ke rup main bulaaye jate hai sab ke sab bas yahi kah rahe the ki raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Those senior reporters above were telling me that Kejriwal is doing politics
 jab unki baat maine suni to mere man main 2 saal pehle kahi gai mere varisht sahyogi or hindi patrakarita ke stambh raveesh kumaar kii ek baat yaad ai
 Actually telling me in connection with an ongoing protest in those days
 maamla ek 5 saal kii choti bacchee ke rape kaa tha or police par maamla darj na karne kaa aarope tha, jisko lekar 'aap' or bijepi pradarshan kar rahe the or report ye kiya ja rahaa tha ki 'aap' or bijepi is mudde par raajnneeti kar rahi hai
 Seeing all this and keeping in mind we were talking, Ravish Kumar told me that Sharad is very 'superficial' journalism
 are bhai in logon kaa kaam he, dharna dena, pradarshan karnaa to wo to apana kaam karenge hi to isamen kehane vaali baat kya he? gaharaai main jaakar reporting karo' Based on this conversation, my understanding was that if the political party is doing anything on an issue, then to say that politics is happening, all of this has no meaning
 are bhai polytical party to bani hi he raajnneeti ke liye
 If the leader does not do politics, will he give a lecture? Or will Pythagoras express his views on the theorem? samajhane kii baat ye he ki koi bhi mudda ek alag chiz he or polytical party us par jo kar rahi he yaa kah rahi he, yah alag chiz he
 And both should be paid differently, but what is happening today? Today it is happening that the issues are only in the name and the real focus is not on it but on politics only
 raajnneeti par focus hamaara zyaada hota he, lekin kehete hai ki ye partiyaan raajnneeti kar rahi hai
 Every leader or political party has the right to raise their issues according to the society and the law, according to their own right, because the general public also has the right to elect or dismiss any party and that is democracy
 
 tippaniyan And our job should be that we should tell the public that the issue is this, whether it contains facts or figures and then tell that this is politics happening on this issue
 keval yah kah dena ki is mudde par raajnneeti ho rahi he, ye mere hisaab se duniya kaa sabase aasaan kaam he

 ye sunakar jo mere man main aayaa vah main aage bataaungaa, lekin maine unase or baat karke na to unka samay jaaya kiya or na apana or ham donon apane apane kaam par chal pade
 Another issue that was still prevalent in Delhi was the municipal strike, due to which Delhi was turned into a garbage dump
 maine is mudde par jitani story,aadhe ghante yaa ek ghante ke lambey kaarykram dekhe sabhi main bas yahi dikhaa ki 'dilli kaa hua kooda' dilli main is gandagi kaa zimmedaar koun?' 'kya bijepi-aap kar rahi hai kooday kii raajnneeti?' yaa phir 'congress ne lagaae bijepi-aap par raajnneeti ke aarope' For the whole 10-12 days, there was a strike in the Municipal Corporation in Delhi and a lot of filth was spread in Delhi, but the responsibility of this could not be decided on anyone
 are bhai sidhaa bataao na ki iskaa zimmedaar koun he, vah bijepi jo nagar nigam par raaj karti he jis par nigam ko chalaane kaa zimmaa he yaa phir vah 'aap' jo dilli par raaj karti he, jis par dilli sarkaar ko chalaane kaa jimmaa he
 Let us also accept a little technical issue here and there, due to which one cannot be blamed, but still there will be one who will be more responsible for this mess
 par kahin koi zimmedaari kaa ata-pataa hi nahin
 The program of the debate also gave the same findings in an hour, giving a 2-minute story of the reporter, and in the debate also, whether the leaders of any party or journalists who are called as experts, all of them were saying this
 That politics is happening
 wo jo upar senior reporter mujhe kah rahe the ki kejariwal raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 When i listened to them, i remembered one thing of my senior colleague and columnist of Hindi journalism, Ravish Kumar, said 2 years ago
 asal main un dinon chal rahe ek virodh pradarshan ke silsile main mujhe bataa rahe the
 The case was about the rape of a 5-year-old girl and the police were accused of not registering a case, about which 'AAP' and BJP were demonstrating and reports were being made that 'AAP' and BJP politics on the issue Is doing
 to ye sab dekhte hue or dhyaan main rakhte ham baat kar rahe the to raveesh kumaar ne mujhe kaha ki sharad ye bahut hi 'satahi' patrakarita he
 Hey brother, this is the work of these people, if they protest, they will do their work, so what is the point of saying this? Go deep and report is baatcheet ke aadhaar par meri samaj bani ki kisi mudde par agar polytical party kuch kar rahi he to yah kah dena ki raajnneeti ho rahi he, ye sabakaa koi matlab nahin he
 Hey brother, the political party has become for politics
 netaa raajnneeti nahin karegaa to kya pravachan degaa? yaa pithagoras kii theoram par apane suvichaar vyakt karegaa? The point to understand is that any issue is a different thing and what the political party is doing or saying on it is a different thing
 or donon ko alag tarah se tavajjo di jaani chahie, lekin aaj ho kya rahaa he? aaj ho ye rahaa he ki mudde to keval naam ke hote hai or asli dhyaan us par na hokar tavajjo to keval raajnneeti par hota he
 Our focus is more on politics, but they say that these parties are doing politics
 har netaa yaa polytical party ko haq he ki wo apane hisaab se samaaj or kanoon se sweekrut daayre main rahakar apane mudde uthaaye apni raajnneeti kare kyonki aam janata ko bhi haq he wo kisi bhi party ko chune yaa khaarij kar de or yahi to loktantr hota he
 The comments or hamaara kaam ye hona chahie ki ham janata ko bataaen ki mudda ye he, isamen ye tathy hai yaa aankade hai or phir bataaen ki ye is mudde par ho rahi raajnneeti he
 To just say that politics is happening on this issue, according to me, this is the easiest job in the world
 ek doosraa mudda jo abhi dilli main chaaya hua tha nagar nigam kii hadtaal kaa, jiske kaaran dilli kooday ke dher main badal gai thi
 In all the stories, half-hour or one-hour-long programs i have seen on this issue, all of them have shown that who is responsible for this mess in Delhi? 'BJP - Are you doing garbage politics?' Or 'congress accuses BJP-AAP of politics' puure 10-12 din dilli main nagar nigam main hadtaal hui or dilli main khub gandagi faili, lekin isaki zimmedaari hi kisi par tay nahin ho pai
 Hey brother, don't tell me directly who is responsible for it, the BJP that rules the municipal corporation, which is responsible for running the corporation or the 'AAP' that rules Delhi, which is responsible for running the Delhi government
 
 chaliye thodaa bahut idhar-udhar or technical ishyu bhi maan len, jiske kaaran kisi ek par zimmedaari nahin daali ja sakati, lekin phir bhi koi ek to hoga, jo is gandagi ke liye zyaada zimmedaar hoga? But there is no sign of responsibility anywhere
 dibet ke program ne bhi ek ghante main vahi nishkarsh die, jo reporter kii 2 minute kii story de rahi thi or dibet main bhi chaahe kisi party ke netaa hon yaa patrkaar jo export ke rup main bulaaye jate hai sab ke sab bas yahi kah rahe the ki raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Those senior reporters above were telling me that Kejriwal is doing politics
 jab unki baat maine suni to mere man main 2 saal pehle kahi gai mere varisht sahyogi or hindi patrakarita ke stambh raveesh kumaar kii ek baat yaad ai
 Actually telling me in connection with an ongoing protest in those days
 maamla ek 5 saal kii choti bacchee ke rape kaa tha or police par maamla darj na karne kaa aarope tha, jisko lekar 'aap' or bijepi pradarshan kar rahe the or report ye kiya ja rahaa tha ki 'aap' or bijepi is mudde par raajnneeti kar rahi hai
 Seeing all this and keeping in mind we were talking, Ravish Kumar told me that Sharad is very 'superficial' journalism
 are bhai in logon kaa kaam he, dharna dena, pradarshan karnaa to wo to apana kaam karenge hi to isamen kehane vaali baat kya he? gaharaai main jaakar reporting karo' Based on this conversation, my understanding was that if the political party is doing anything on an issue, then to say that politics is happening, all of this has no meaning
 are bhai polytical party to bani hi he raajnneeti ke liye
 If the leader does not do politics, will he give a lecture? Or will Pythagoras express his views on the theorem? samajhane kii baat ye he ki koi bhi mudda ek alag chiz he or polytical party us par jo kar rahi he yaa kah rahi he, yah alag chiz he
 And both should be paid differently, but what is happening today? Today it is happening that the issues are only in the name and the real focus is not on it but on politics only
 raajnneeti par focus hamaara zyaada hota he, lekin kehete hai ki ye partiyaan raajnneeti kar rahi hai
 Every leader or political party has the right to raise their issues according to the society and the law, according to their own right, because the general public also has the right to elect or dismiss any party and that is democracy
 
 tippaniyan And our job should be that we should tell the public that the issue is this, whether it contains facts or figures and then tell that this is politics happening on this issue
 keval yah kah dena ki is mudde par raajnneeti ho rahi he, ye mere hisaab se duniya kaa sabase aasaan kaam he
