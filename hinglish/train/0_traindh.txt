 ' notebandi ke baad ab halaat kaaphi sudhare hai
 But due to scarcity of cash in the co-operative bank of Dhaulana, farmers are not able to get cash as per requirement
 ab is ilaake main notebandi bada chunavi mudda ban gaya he
 On Monday morning, many farmers from Dhaulana's cooperative bank arrived to withdraw money, but the cash did not reach them
 niraash kisaanon kaa kahana he ki bhale hi notebandi ke teen maheene biit chuke hon lekin paisa nikaalane main ab bhi mushkil ho rahi he
 Sugarcane farmers face the most problem, whose payment comes only in the accounts of cooperative banks
 ganna kisaanon kii shikaayat he ki sahakaari bainkon main hafte main do din hi paisa pahunchataa he
 From the top the cooperative bank has fixed ceiling of Rs 4000
 ganna kisaanon kaa pement sahakaari bank khaaton main hi aata he
 It has been three months of demonetisation but it is getting difficult to withdraw my own money
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki notebandi dhaulana ke liye aaj bhi ek ahm chunavi mudda he jise bispi ummidavaar asalam choudhary apni sabhaaon main jorshor se uthaa rahe hai
 They say that the Prime Minister has increased the difficulties of common people by taking the decision of demonetisation
 log pareshaan hai lekin sarkaar unki samasya dur nahin kar paa rahi he
 The comments dhaulana se sapa-congress ummidavaar dharmesh tomars kehete hai notebandi se ilaake ke kisaanon ko khaastaur par kaaphi mushkilen ho rahi hai
 He told NDTV "demonetisation has brought farmers into disrepair
 kheti ke liye jaruri kharch ke liye cash ikattha karnaa kisaanon ke liye mushkil ho rahaa he
 
 
 Life has been disturbed in Dhaulana
 " But for BJP, the biggest electoral issue is not Akhilesh Raj's plight
 party ke ummidavaar ramesh chandra tomars kehete hai unke liye sapa sarkaar ke dauraan prashasnic kamajoriyaan or ilaake main gundgardee sabase ahm chunavi mudda he
 They are also angry that sp-congress and BSP candidates are adopting various tactics to woo the Muslim community
 somvaar kii subah dhaulana ke sahakaari bank se paisa nikaalane aasapaas ke kai kisaan to pahunche lekin cash hi nahin pahunchaa
 Disappointed farmers say that even though three months of demonetisation have passed, it is still difficult to withdraw money
 sabase zyada pareshaani ganna kisaanon ko he jinka pement kooparative bainkon ke khaaton main hi aata he
 Sugarcane farmers complain that money reaches the cooperative banks only two days a week

 The payment of sugarcane farmers comes in the cooperative bank accounts only
 notebandi ke teen maheene ho chuke hai lekin apana hi paisa nikaalnaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Perhaps this is the reason why demonetisation is still an important election issue for Dhaulana, which BSP candidate Aslam Chaudhary is vigorously raising in his meetings

 What is your assessment of the economic scenario of America and Europe? How worried should India be about the 2012 trends? The recession in the US and the government debt crisis in the Eurozone will have an impact on India's short-term prospects

 But we will be able to deal with the global impact by diversifying the elements of economic strength and export goods as well as export countries

 Some time back on the controversy over Jinnah's picture in AMU, UP BJP MLA Surendra Singh said that he was the executioner in India's democracy
 vahiin tripura main bijepi ke siem biplab kumaar deb bhi kai vivaadit bayanon ko lekar charchaa main rahe

 The piece of paper you see in the hands of 52-year-old Lakhbir Singh is actually a bill for pesticides and other things used in agriculture
 punjab main is chit ko kaccha bill kaha jaataa he
 You may be surprised how a paper chit bill can be there, because it has neither the name of the seller's firm nor any GST or other tax information on the chit
 aap is chit ko dhyaan se dekhen to iske jamaa main do hajaar rupee kii gadabadi bhi he
 The case is that vicious shopkeepers in Punjab are making big money in the name of GST
 kisaanon se krishi rasayanon or kheti main istemaal hone vaali duusari chizon par manmarzi kaa jiesti (18 se 28 fisadi ) vasuul kar vasteen badi hui keemton par bech rahe hai
 Farming chemicals are also being sold at grocery stores, but buyers are not billed after the sale
 jiesti ke naam par thage gayi lakhbeer singh koi akele kisaan nahin he
 Apart from Lakhbir Singh, talk about Gurdas Singh, the bill in his hand is the bill of feed of cow buffalo
 kehane ko kaital feed main jiesti lagu nahin he, lekin kai dukandaar bill main tex kii jaankaree na dekar golmol tareeke se tex vasuul rahe hai yani jis chiz par jiesti lagu hi nahin he unpar bhi tex vasula ja rahaa he
 Most of the farmers in the state are not educated, who have no knowledge of GST
 shaatir dukandaaron dwaara vasula gaya tex na to rajya sarkaar ke khate main jamaa ho rahaa he or na centre sarkaar ke khajaane main
 He is going straight into the pocket of profiteers
 mohali ke 42 varshiya kisaan dalvinder singh ke mutabik jabase punjab main jiesti lagu hua he dukandaaron ko lutpaat kaa mauka mil gaya he
 In Punjab, crops have already been destroyed due to sale of fake pesticides
 vahiin jiesti lagu hone ke baad kitnashkon sahit kheti main istemaal hone vaali har cheez kii keemton main 5 fisadi se lekar 15 fisadi tak badhotaree ho gai he
 After the implementation of GST, 18% tax is being levied on pesticides and 12% tax on fertilizers
 jiesti lagu hone se pehle krishi rasayanon par 12
 There was 5 percent tax, that is, farmers have to save 5 separate crops now
 5 fisadi tex adaa karnaa pad rahaa he
 Due to the business of counterfeit medicines in Punjab, it is already difficult to protect the crops from the attack of insect mites, now the sellers of fake medicines are also making big money in the name of GST
 mohali ke gaanv main kheti karne vaale lakhbeer singh ne hamen bataaya ki ek to pehle hi khaad kii kam aapurti hoti he or jab se jiesti lagu hua he tab se munafkhori bhi bad gai he
 Fertilizer vendors are now also forced to buy fertilizers such as zinc and sulfate
 unke anusaar krishi rasayanon main jiesti ke baad 200 rupee se 300 rupee prati oochaal aayaa he
 Buyers are not billed even after collecting tax
 udhaar lene ke kaaran bill nahin maangate kisanmohali ke diya gaanv ke yuva kisaan balkaar singh ke mutabik punjab ke kisaan fasal bikne tak krishi rasayan urvarak or duusari chijen udhaar lekar kharidte hai
 The shopkeeper gives him just a chit
 kisaan 6 maheene ke baad sabhi chit saath lekar uskaa bhugtan kar dete hai
 If the bill is demanded, the seller scares you by saying that if you want a surety bill, you will have to pay tax money separately
 kharidne vaale ko nahin bataaya jaataa kii use jo chit thamai gai he usame jiesti bhi shaamil he
 Fearful of the high price, the borrower farmer could not dare to take the bill from the shopkeeper
 jalalpur ,mohali ke 42 varshiya kisaan darshan singh ke mutabik jiesti ke naam par kii jane vaali thagi sirf krishi rasayanon tak hi simit nahin he
 Driver shopkeepers who do not pay the bills are also charging GST on animal feed, animal medicines etc
 but in the name of giving the bill they cut the trowel
 hamane jiesti ke naam par thagi kar rahe kai dukandaaron se baat kerani chahie, lekin vah hamaare dukaan par pahunchane se pehle hi vah yaa to dukaan band karke idhar udhar khisak liye yaa phir camere par baat karne ke liye taiyaar nahin hue
 The Department of Agriculture has remained silent on the issue of fake agricultural chemicals sold in the state
 adhikari daawa kar rahe hai ki rajya main nakli kitnashak bechney kaa kii ek bhi shikaayat unke paas nahin ai he, jabaki hakeekat yah he ki rajya ke kisaan nakli kitnashkon kii bikri se behad pareshaan hai
 The farmers are committing suicide after the crops are destroyed, but the government is sitting hand in hand
 jiesti ke naam par ho rahi chorbazari ke bare main jab rajya ke krishi adhikariyon se baat kii gai to unhone bharosa dilaayaa ki vah kisaanon ko jiesti ke bare main jaagruk karenge or pehle se hi aagaah karte aae hai ki vah har kharidari kaa bill jarur len taaki dawaaen yaa rasayan nakli paae jane ke baad sambandhit dukandaar ke khilaaf karrwai kii ja sake
 Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh had recently expressed his displeasure against GST by writing a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to this letter, the cost of farming in Punjab has increased from 5 per cent to 15 per cent
 rajya sarkaar ne rajya kii kharaab mali haalat kaa hawala dete hue centre se atirikt vittiya sahaayta kii maang kii he, lekin sarkaar ko shaayad nahin maaloom ki vah jiesti ko prabhavi dhang se lagu kare or jiesti ke naam par thagi karne vaale dukandaaron par ection le to na keval uske khajaane main paisa aayega balki kisaan bhi luutane se bachenge

 The left-handed classical fast bowler dodged the batsman with Nehra's ball speed, accuracy and line and length changes
 of said ke baahar jaati unki gend or unka let inaswinger kisi bhi ballebaaz ko pareshaan kar saktaa tha
 44 wickets in 17 Tests
 120 vanade main 157 wicket
 34 wickets in 26 T20s
 18 saal ke lambey kariyar ke baad 38 saal kii umr main ashish nehra cricket ko alavida kah rahe hai
 Hardly any fast bowler should have such a long career
 sar don breadman tisare number par ballebaazi karne vaale australia ke or duniya bhar ke sabase mashhoor cricketer the
 One day ODI was not played during Sir Don Bradman, but Test or ODI Australia's number three batsmen have often been his best batsmen, who have given sleep to the opposition team in big matches
 tisare number ke in australian ballebaazon ne team india ko bhi kai baar pareshaan kiya he or kai baar tisare number ke ballebaaz kii pari yaa to match ko apane dam par nikaal le gaye hai yaa phir team india kii pareshaani kaa sabab banate rahe hai
 In the current World Cup, India is once again getting the opportunity to chase such a goal, where the team will need to play above the level
 west indies or zimbabwe jaisi tiimon ke kilaaf bhi lakshya kaa peechha karte hue team india ne romaanchak jeet darj kii, lekin is world cap main australia jaisi badi team ke bade lakshya (329 ) kaa peechha karne ke liye ballebaazon ko vaaki apana jor dikhaanaa hoga
 In this tournament, Team India has so far managed to chase goals against four teams - UAE, West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe
 lekin 2015 world cap ke semifinal main tii factor- yani toss or number thri yani tisare number kaa ballebaaz ek baar phir team india ke liye kanta sabit hua
 Whatever captain won the toss of Sydney, he would bat first
 captain dhoni ne toss ke foran baad ye baat saafe bhi kar di
 Despite losing the toss, Team India got Australia's first wicket early (1 / 15- David Warner's wicket), but the number three batsman Steven Smith got his courage by hitting Umesh Yadav in the tenth over and the team Started dominating India
 smith ne sirf 93 gendon par 11 chauke or 2 chakke lagaakar 112
 Scored 105 runs at a strike rate of 9 and decided that Australia would target more than 300 in front of India and that too
 tisare number ke ballebaaz kaa ye aakraamak tevar team india par kai baar baari padaa he
 Recall the World Cup final match in 2003 in Johannesburg
 team india ne toss jitkar australia ko batting karne kaa mauqaa diya
 Harbhajan Singh took two wickets of the fast-scoring Australian team, ie Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden, but the number three batsman Ricky Ponting scored 140 not out from 121 balls and India scored 360 runs to win
 Goal found
 phir jo hua us itihaas se sab vaakif hai
 The World Cup kept on coming
 2011 world cap ke quarter final main ek baar phir riki ponting ne apana jalawaa dikhaaya
 Australia scored a target of 261 runs to win in front of India with the help of third century batsman Ponting's century in Ahmedabad, but under the leadership of captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Team India managed to achieve this goal

 When the goons were flirting with them, making obscene slogans and even getting into a scuffle, it felt like there were no men in the bus
 sab ke sab mook darshak bane rahe
 The girls have been treated badly, they have got scuffles, but the so-called men are sitting quietly, it is a matter of shame

 In such a situation, people have to raise their voice against injustice

 At the same time, the BJP shouted at the statement

 Five firefighters controlled the fire

 The accident occurred during a stunt scene in the lake adjacent to the Tipagondanahalli dam in Bangalore

 - The board said that there was no permission to take aerial shots on the dam
 film kru kathith taur par niyamon ko ulanghan karte huehelicopter se seen shootakar rahaa tha
 - a boat was arranged in the name of safety, by which no major accident could be dealt with
 - shooting se pehle kru ne kisi motor boat, life jacket or ambulance kaa intjaam nahin kiya
 - It is also being told that the rehearsal of this stunt was not done earlier
 -jhil ke kinare maujuud logon ne duubate stantmanako bachaane ke liye rescue boat par baithe kru members ko khub oonchi aawaaj main bataaya, lekin takneekee khaamiyon kii vajah se boat aage nahin bad saki
 Before doing this, Uday said in a media interaction that he was afraid of this stunt, because he does not know how to swim properly
 unhone kaha tha ki na to unhone pehle kabhi aisa stant kiya he or na hi unhone aisa stant karte hue pehle kisi ko dekha he
 He had said that he can jump into the water and can also swim and get out, but he has never jumped in the water from such a high height, so this time he is scared

 Not only this, urban Naxalites are openly helping them to gain a foothold in the cities, which has been revealed by some recent arrests
 jaahir he ye rajya or desh kii suraksha ke liye sabase badi chintaa kaa vishay he
 When and when attacks occurred
 
 
 rajanandgaanv main pichley dinon jo naksal sambandhi vaaradaaten hui hai ve apane aap main behad chintajanak hai
 The biggest thing is that the movement of Maoists has started migrating from Bastar and Dantewada to areas like Rajnandgaon and Kawardha
 pichley 6 maheenon main saamne ai jaankariyon se saaf samajha ja saktaa he ki naksali chhattisgarh ke shaharon kaa rukh kar rahe hai
 Let's take a look at the recent events that have taken place around cities like Rajnandgaon and Kawardha
 12 april- rajanandgaanv shahar se 135 kilometre dur manpur main teen idi dhamaake hue, jisamen itibipi ke do jawan ghayal hue
 April 10 - a search party of the police found a huge mob of Maoists on Bukmarca Hill in Manpur

 iske alaava rajanandgaanv police ne 24 disambar ko badi kaarywahi karte hue venkat naam ke ek shaks kii giraftaar kii jis par naksaliyon ke liye kaam karne kaa aarope he
 Chhattisgarh Police also called it Urban Naxal
 venkat ke thik pehle sarita naam kii mahila naksali kii bhi giraftaar rajanandgaanv shahar se hi hui thi
 Sarita and Venkat not only provided financial assistance to the Naxalites living in the thick jungles along the border, but also provided them with the necessary information including the items of need
 yahaan tak ki chhattisgarh police bhi maanati he ki urban naksal aantarik suraksha ke liye bada khatra hai
 What does the police have to say 
 
 rajanandgaanv ke suparitendent of police ke el kashyap ne aaj tak se baatcheet main kaha yah sach he urban naksal naksaliyon kii life line he, jo unhen har jaruri or buniyadi suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karavaate hai
 SP of Rajnandgaon, KL Kashyap says that the Churiya area of rajnandgaon is the center of Naxalites, also known as Epicenter of MMC
 chhuria se ek taraf rasta maharashtra ke gatchiroli kii ore jaataa he to doosraa rasta bhandara kii ore
 Maharashtra Gadchiroli is considered a stronghold of Naxalites
 duusari ore rasta madhya pradesh se jude hue bhaave or gatapar jangal se judaa hua he
 The entire line of forest from Bastar Dantewada connects Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh
 rajanandgaanv se nikle rashtriya rajmarg ke jariye naksaliyon ko madad bhi aaraam se pahunch rahi he
 Rajnandgaon police say that this MMC area has inaccessible hills for inaccessible hills and National Highway Naxalites, due to which they are leaving Bastar and Dantewada and moving towards the cities of west and north through dense forests
 chhuria mencsli ek dashak se sirdard bane hue hai
 
 
 Explain that the Naxalite movement of Churia is a decade old
 ek dashak pehle isi chhuria se rajnandagaanv main naksali movement kii shuruyaat hui thi
 With the changing times, Rajnandgaon was freed from Naxalites by a continuous operation by paramilitary forces and Chhattisgarh Police
 lekin teen rajyon se milti hui simaaen is ilaake main naksaliyon ke liye sabase badi madadgaar ban gai
 Local journalist Manoj Chandel says that the Maoists have made Kawardha and Rajnandgaon their new destinations due to the borders of the three states and connectivity to the national highway
 chandel bataate hai ki chhuria ke police thane ko naksaliyon ne 10 saal pehle aag lagaakar bandooken lut lee thi saath hi police waalon ko naksaliyon ne bandhak bana liya tha
 But after 10 years, Naxalism has returned to this area
 pehle jangalon main hote the hamale ab shahar ke najdiki ilaake ban rahe nishaanaa
 
 
 Naxalite attacks continued in remote forests till a few years ago, but recently police have started getting ieds from areas near the city
 dantewada main naksali hamale main maare gaye bijepi netaa bhima mandavi ke saath hui ghatana shahar se bahut zyada dur nahin hui thi
 Experts say that at a distance of about 50 km from the city, there are many such villages which have now become part of the Rajnandgaon municipality
 aise hi isi ek gaanv main rahane vaale udairam ke bhai ko naksaliyon ne kuch saal pehle uthaa liya tha, lekin baad main use chhod diya
 3 months ago he too felt the call of the entire Naxalite team near his house
 haalanki, udai kaa kahana he ki, "hamen naksaliyon se dar nahin lagata kyonki naksali hamen nuksaan nahin pahunchaate
 Neither we are their informers nor work for the Naxalites, so the Naxalites did not harm us
 "dekha jaae to yahaan aas-paas ke gaanv main kai chauraahon par laal jhanda latakta najar aata he
 Most people do not want to say anything about Naxalites
 naa to vah kuch kehete hai naa kisi sawaal kaa jawaab dete hai
 Perhaps it is the fear of the Naxalites who are sitting fearfully in the minds of the people here
 naksaliyon ke garh main itibipi kaa bescamp
 
 
 The road leading to the Maharashtra border passes through the main highway of Rajnandgaon to Jok
 jahaan haal philhal main itibipi ne apana ek bada base camp banaaya he
 This entire area is considered a stronghold of Naxalites and hence the roads here are bereft of development
 aasapaas kii pahadiyaan ghaney jangal or teen rajya kii simaaon kii bhugolic sthiti naksaliyon ke liye dhaal kaa kaam kar rahi he

 Climate scientist RK Pachauri was dismissed as the head of TERI more than five months after he was accused of sexual harassment by a junior colleague
 urja dakshata beuro ke mahanideshak ajay maathur (74) ko pachori kaa uttaradhikari niyukt kiya gaya
 This decision was taken at a time when a Delhi court had allowed RK Pachauri to enter Terry's premises leaving Terry's head office and Gurgaon branch a few days ago
 da energy and resorcej institute (teri)kii sanchaalan parishad (GC) ne ek baithak main pachori ko terry ke mahanideshak pad se hataane kaa faisla kiya
 The Council said, 'at the meeting of teri's Governing Council in Bengaluru, it was decided to appoint Ajay Mathur, Director General of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, Government of India, as the new Director General of TERI

 The country is aware of the news of the death of former President APJ Abdul Kalam
 lekin kuch viipi hastiyon ne unhen shradhanjali dete hue ek aisi galati kar di ki saare-duniya sharmasaar ho gaye
 Actually the name of APJ Abdul Kalam matches the freedom fighter Abul Kalam Azad
 isliye itihaas kii kitaaben padhate hue schuli chaatr kabhi-kabhi kanphyus ho jate the
 Confusion of children is understandable, but on Tuesday, three celebrities addressed him as 'abdul Kalam Azad' while mourning the demise of the former president
 inamen se do hastiyon kaa vaasta filmi duniya se he or ek janaab 9 karod kii aabaadi vaale ek soobe ke ajukeshan ministar hai
 Listen to their names - film actress Anushka Sharma, actor Farhan Akhtar and West Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee
 anoushka-farhaan hue sharmasaaganushka sharma or farhaan akhtar ne yah galati twitor par shradhanjali dete hue kii
 Farhan wrote the name of former President 'APJ Abdul Kalam Azad' while Anushka went a step ahead and wrote 'ABJ Abdul Kalam Azad'
 haalanki baad main donon ne apane-apane twit delit karke dobaaraa sahi naam ke saath shradhanjali arpit kii
 Neither of them regretted writing the wrong name
 jo nahin jaanate hai, fark jaan lenudhar mamata banerjee ke shiksha mantri ne to saarvajanik rup se manch par bolte hue abdul kalam ko 'abdul kalam aaazaad' kah daalaa
 The state's Education Minister and Bollywood vip-jan are also victims of confusions, so we once again make the basic difference between APJ Abdul Kalam and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad
 moulana aaazaad san 1888 main janme the or congress ke netaa the
 He played an important role in the freedom struggle
 aazaadee ke baad vah desh ke pehle shiksha mantri bane
 He died in 1958
 duusare, unke naam main abdul nahin 'abul' he or naam ke aage 'moulana' bhi likhaa jaataa he
 Hence, the two Mukhtalif names are: (1) APJ Abdul Kalam, the former President of the country and (2) Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, who was a soldier of independence

 In the last few days, the number of patients who have come to the city psychiatrists have also been complaining of restlessness, stress, depression and sleepiness
 kaala dhan rakhane waalon par bukamp ke jatke jaisaa asarvisheshgyon kaa kahana he ki jinhone nakadi main kaala dhan juta rakhaa tha un par notebandi kaa vaisaa hi asar hua he jaise bukamp ke jatke par hota he

 This is the reason why the phones of psychiatric experts are constantly ringing
 apratyaashit sthiti saamne aane se asuraksha kaa bhavadilli ke manorog visheshgy dow
 Sandeep Vohra says that if you are financially secure then problems like restlessness, stress, depression are reduced
 lekin jab koi apratyaashit sthiti saamne aa jaae or log uske liye taiyaar nahin hon to ye asuraksha kaa bodh detaa he
 Dr
 vohara ke mutabik aise log unke paas aa rahe hai jo sawaal kar rahe hai ki puraani karency kaa kya karen? nai karency kaise milegi? lambii kataron ke jhanjhat se kaise nipten? saath hi wo bechaini, tanaav, avsaad or neend nahin aane kii shikaayat kar rahe hai
 Psychiatrist Dr Bhavna Burney of Fortis Escorts, Okhla, Delhi, says that the decision of Kinotbandi has no direct relation with the health of the people
 lekin achaanak nai sthiti saamne aane kii vajah se logon main tanaav badha he
 It is important to know the old medical history
 bhaavana barney ke mutabik jis tarah ke cese saamne aa rahe hai unamem aise bhi hai jinhone sach main kaala dhan nakadi main rakhaa hua he
 And now because of that money being no longer of any use, stress has increased in them
 lekin sirf is vajah se jaan par ban aae, aisa nahin he
 It is very important to look at the old health history as well
 agar swasthya sambandhi pehle se hi jatiltaayen hai to sthiti gambhir ho sakati he
 The extent to which such people can withstand stress depends greatly on the level
 dow barney kaa kahana he ki kuch log asuvidha kii vajah se bhi avsaad (depressant)main ja rahe hai
 They feel that there are so many long queues, how the situation will be dealt with, when everything will be normal
 dow barney ke mutabik aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa ki kaale dhan ke khilaaf uthaae gaye kadam kii vajah se koi khudakushi kar rahaa he yaa logon kii jaan ja rahi hai
 Dr
 Bhavna Burney says that if someone is already a heart patient and takes more stress then the possibility of 'acute attack' increases
 kya barti jaaen saavdhaaniyaan?is sthiti se nipatane ke liye logon ko dow
 Sandeep Vohra's advice is that whatever is troubling your mind, share it with your close and trusted people
 iske alaava kisi achche vittiya salaahkaar se bhi aarthik muddon par salaah le sakate hai
 If symptoms of stress and depression are more effective, seek medical attention
 dow vohara kaa kahana he ki aise logon ko samajhaana chahie ki akele unheen ko is sthiti kaa saamana nahin karnaa pad rahaa
 The same situation exists for every citizen of the country
 ye jo bhi sthiti he wo asthaayee taur par he
 Everything will become normal as soon as stability comes
 dow
 According to Vohra, stress has nothing to do with rich or poor
 jis vyakti ke paas adhik nakad dhan he to use ise nai karency main badalane kaa tanaav he
 At the same time, people with weak economic conditions are under stress that if such a situation lasts for a long time, then how will they arrange cash to buy the essential goods
 kaise nipten sthiti se?dow
 Bhavna Burney says that if someone already has a medical history, he should take some precaution beforehand
 jaise unhen qatari main khadaa hona he to saath main jaruri davaaiyaan, khaane kaa saamaan, pani or energy drinks saath rakhane chahien
 Also, prepare yourself physically and mentally with exercise and meditation
 dow barney ke mutabik logon ko sthiti ko apane upar haaavee hone dene se bachanaa chahie
 This situation is not related to any particular person but everyone is facing it
 agar kisi ko tanaav yaa avsaad jaisi samasya aa rahi he to uske liye family or doston kii saport bhi bahut ahm hoti he
 It is necessary to make him realize that everyone is with him and all are facing this situation

 However, the Pentagon says that the US military is vigilant about Russian and Syrian security forces

 The US Secretary of State was going to visit Russia soon, but now it is also clouded by crisis
 aise main kahin do mahashaktiyon ke bich takaraav vishwayuddh kii vajah na ban jaae

 He has been carrying out frequent air strikes on behalf of Assad by Syrian rebels and IS militants
 rus apane rukh ko tanik bhi badalanaa nahin chahta he
 Now the situation has become such that Russian President Putin has openly opposed US President Donald Trump regarding the US attack on the hideout of Syrian security forces
 unhone kaha ki america ne syria par hamalaa karke antarrashtriya kanoonon kaa ulanghan kiya he
 Not only this, Putin even said that Russia and America's relationship has deteriorated due to this attack and now Russia will not help America

 chunki dilli sarkaar ection plan ko lagu karne ke liye taiyaar he, isliye sawaal yah he ki vaahan chaalkon ke kis segment ko vaikalpik din chhot di jaani chahie

 Delhi government says that from the point of view of safety of women, this scheme was implemented in 2016, then only women passengers were exempted in all vehicles
 dilli main mahilaayein apane vaahanon main zyada surakshit mahasoos karti hai, is kaaran aisa kiya gaya tha
 Additionally, school vehicles with female drivers and school going children were exempted
 mukhyamantri ne parivahan vibhaag ko is varsh bhi yah chhot dene par vichaar rakhane ko kaha he
 The number of two-wheelers was more than 70 lakhs

 haalanki, kuch logon ne aapatti bhi kii thi
 The latest estimate of the number of two-wheelers plying in Delhi is more than seven million
 agar do pahiyaa vaahanon ko chhot nahin di jaati he to isse har din saarvajanik parivahan par switch vaale 35 lakh se adhik log honge
 The Chief Minister has asked to review the current capacity of the public transport network and give its views on whether two-wheelers should be exempted this year

 The chief minister is concerned that the scheme may fail to achieve its objective if people circumvent the restrictions by using incorrectly purchased CNG stickers to avoid punishment
 siem arvind kejariwal ne indraprastha gas limited or sienji stikar ke vitaran main shaamil adhikariyon ke vichaaron par ek sthiti banane ko kaha he
 The Department should consider whether there is any way to identify genuine CNG vehicles and in the absence of such a methodology, what the Department views on the exemption given to CNG vehicles

 Former Telecom Minister A
 rajaor unke sahyogiyon ne doorsanchaar license dene main swaan telikam or unitech kaa paksh lene ke liye adhikariyon ko dhamkaaya or majaboor kiya tha
 The CBI has given this information to the Joint Parliamentary Committee investigating the 2G scam
 spectrum aabantan ghotaale ke vibhinn pahaluon par 7 june ko bayaan dete hue sibiai ke nideshak api singh ne samiti ko bataaya ki do adhikariyon ne tata tele ke upar swaan telikam ko variyata nahin di thi
 At the behest of Raja's personal secretary RK Chandolia, then telecom secretary Siddharth Behura replaced him
 singh ne samiti ko bataaya ki tatkaaleen wireles adwiser arapy agarwal ko ‘bure nattejey bhugatne’ kii thos dhamkee di gai thi or unhen dilli cirkil main swaan ko spectrum abantit karne ke liye ek note bhejne ko baadhya kiya gaya

 If you want a person with all your heart and love you with the same loyalty, there is no better feeling
 prem karne vaala badale main prem kii aas rakhata he
 However, there are many people who play with the feelings of the people according to their needs
 isse naa keval duusare partner ke man ko chot pahunchati he balki prem main dhokhaa khaae kai log galat kadam bhi uthaa lete hai
 Dude friends do not give them anything except taunts
 aise main saathi ke bare main jaananaa bahut jaruri ho jaataa he ki wo aapse prem karata he yaa nahin
 There are many people who pretend so well that you do not know whether they love you or not
 kai baar to shaq tak nahin hota he
 But we are going to tell you the three traits based on which you can catch a cheating boyfriend
 ankhen hai anmol, garmi main is tarah rakhen khyalarishte main baton kii mithaas gholne se sambandh majboot hote hai
 People in love keep talking to their girlfriend all night
 haalanki yah kuch samay ke liye hi hota he
 If your boyfriend does not talk to you with love at all, then try to find out the reason for that
 ho saktaa he ki vah vyavhaar se hi bahut batooni naa ho lekin agar vah aapaki baton se chidh rahaa he or aapako yaad nahin aa rahaa he ki antim baar usne kab aapse prem se baat kii thi to aapako boyfriend par najar rakhane kii jarurat he
 Such patients are growing in North India, be careful that you find yourself on the pretext of meeting someone you love, but if you always make plans, then stop and consider
 ho saktaa he ki uski profeshnal life kii vajah se vah time nahin de paa rahaa ho lekin lage ki wo milanaa hi nahin chahta yaa phir beman se aata he to aapako sochane kii jarurat he
 Prem asks for proof
 agar vah aapke doston yaa family ke kisi member se milane main kataraata he to aapako sanbhal janaa chahie
 He may be a bit hesitant, but it is also possible that he is walking a certain distance from you so that he can make it easier for you to leave

 Something similar has happened in the agenda till date, when two superstars Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, who have been away while competing with each other for statements and films, were embraced again
 hua kuch yun ki agenda aaj tak ke pehle din ke ek seshan main aamir khan hamaare mehmaan the to duusare seshan main shahrukh khan
 Both boarded the same flight from Mumbai
 jab mili to bagalgir bhi ho liye
 Landed by the wind
 dilli kii jameen par
 Where the thrust of the heart moves
 ham apane mehmaanon ko livane pahunche, to aashcharyamishrit khushi intjaar kar rahi thi
 Both superstars were coming out talking like this, Goya must have met the backward sisters of the years and wants to unleash the secret of the past
 shahrukh apni car kii taraf bad hi rahe the aayojan sthal kii taraf aane ke liye ki aamir ne unhen apni taraf phir bula liya
 Irar and then both left in the same car from the airport
 guftgu kaa daur vahaan bhi chalaa or use pehla viraam mila hotel main aakar
 When Aamir Agenda came on the stage till date, the series of questions turned on Shahrukh Khan
 aamir bole ki ham donon bahut achche dost hai
 We are of the same age and in terms of career, i am senior to Shahrukh
 or dekhie ab ek or samanta jud gai he
 Our children Azad and Abram are also more or less the same age
 hamane aaj unke bare main khub baaten kin or bataur baap apane-apane anubhav saajha kiye
 Is Chennai Express's record success any pressure on Aamir's film Dhoom 3
 is sawaal ke jawaab main aamir bole ki ham donon ko itane baras ho gaye hai industry main
 Now these types of matches have no meaning
 aamir ne kaha ki meri bas itani chintaa rahati he ki jin prodyucers ne paisa lagaaya he, unhen koi nuksaan na ho
 a few hours later, Shah Rukh Khan arrived on the same stage
 unhone bataaya ki mujhamen or aamir main ek hi fark he
 He does very few short films and is afraid of falling prey to lethargy
 or meraa apana dar ye he ki main itnaa zyada active rahata hum ki kahin bern out na ho jaaun
 This is a matter of different style of both
 uske baad ai king khan kii apil
 He said that i request everyone to definitely watch Aamir's film Dhoom 3
 bahut shandaar kaam najar aa rahaa he unka
 After this, Shahrukh also narrated an anecdote copying Aamir
 unhone bataaya ki jab donon flite main saath baithe the, to airhostess chaay-coffee ke liye poochne aae
 i quickly said black coffee
 aamir kaaphi der sochakar bole, chaay, haa chaay hi pi letaa hum
 After some time our tray arrived
 airhostess aamir kii chaay main doodh milaane lagi, to unhone phir roak diya
 Said, stop for a while
 jaraa chaay kaa color to aa jaae
 Note that when Shahrukh was telling all these things, the statements of Aamir's part were repeating in the same manner
 baad main shahrukh ne ek or kissa sunaaya, jo aamir se nahin khud se unase judaa he
 a guard outside the hotel hugged him warmly and said, very happy to see you alive
 guard kaa matlab tha, aamane saamne milakar
 Shahrukh understood this and shared his lyrics on Facebook
 saajha unhone aamir ke saath apane puraane safar ko bhi kiya
 Best wishes to both till today dilli kii jama masjid ke shahi imam ahamed bukhari ab bahujan samaaj party (bispi) se najdiki badhaane kii koshish kar rahe hai

 This is not the first time that Imam Bukhari is leaning towards any political party before the election
 isse pehle alag-alag vakt main ve bijepi, congress or samaajawaadee party ke hamakadam ho chuke hai
 Nasimuddin Siddiqui has confirmed the meeting
 unhone kaha ki bukhari sahab lambey samay se party ke sampark main hai
 Asked if the Imam would join the BSP, Siddiqui said he could not say anything about it
 party kii mukhiya mayawati hi is bare main koi faisla lengi
 If sources are to be believed, the BSP is acting strictly in this deal and the Imam's representatives have been told that they will not have any condition in the BSP
 agar samarthan karnaa he to siddhanton ke aadhaar par kiya jaae
 BSP sources claimed that apart from the Imam, Maulana Mahmood Madani and people from Bareilly's Sunni Ulema Council are also in constant touch with the party
 bispi supremeo mayawati ne pichley hafte dilli main jis tarah bijepi ke pradhanmantri pratyaashee narendra modi par tikhe hamale kiye usase saaf he ki party is baar musalamaanon ko rijhaane main koi kasar nahin chhodeygi
 Significantly, in the last assembly election of Uttar Pradesh, Imam's son-in-law lost the election on the ticket of SP

 In front of Osho's arguments, he became very silent or his mind wandered
 aam aadmi ko america main ek inch jameen kharidne main pasinaa aa jaae or madhyapradesh ke kuchwada gaanv main paidaa hua ye darshanashastri vahaan 64 hajaar acre main ‘rajanishpuram’ basaakar aa gaya
 When a line of white skinned people wore ocher robes, bigwigs of America and Europe were stunned
 uske naam kii ek lahar chal uthi thi
 But not everything happened like this
 osho kii punyatithi (19 janvari) par jaanate hai unki dilachasp dastaan
 Osho first researched the writings of intellectuals from all over the world, thought it over and then put it in the mind and forgot the nonsense
 osho ne apane jivan main dedh lakh kitaaben padhi thim
 He had also built a library of his own, which is named 'laatsu Library'
 osho ne apni mrityu se pehle kaha tha ki is pustkaalay kii sabhi kitabon ko taalon main band kar diya jaae
 These are not for the common people
 ye unheen ke liye hai, jo un par shodh kar rahe hon
 They too can get a maximum of three books at a time
 osho bhakthi ke kaaran tuuti thi vinod khanna kii shaadi, phir 16 saal choti kavita bani humsafaris par bani ek documentry main osho kah rahe hai ki unhone is librari kii har ek kitaab padhi he
 There are 3500 books in them, which Osho signed after reading them and made a colorful painting
 is pustkaalay par bani documentry ko is link par jaakar dekh sakate hai
 https: / / www
 youtube
 com / watch? v = j1h8-wvzexy By the way, Osho's amazing knowledge seen in listening and reading, there is no harm in believing this one and a half million
 banda upanishdon se shuru karata he or colin wilson kii ‘da outsidar’ par aakar rukta he
 His favorite books are Mikhail Naime's 'the Book of Mirdad', Jiddu Krishnamurthy's 'the First and Last Freedom', Laotsu's Tao Ti Ching, Omar Khayyam's 'rubaiyat', Mable Collins's 'light of the Path' etc
 osho ne plato, nitshe, frid, arestu, dostovsky, fredrick, sucraat, shopenhavar, kabir, nanak, buddha, mahavir sabko padhaa
 He wrote a book on his books, called 'books i Have Loved'
 ise unhone khud nahin likhaa tha, balki bolkar apane us dentist se likhvaya tha, jiske paas unka ilaaj chal rahaa tha
 In it, Osho mentions 160 such Must Read books, which impressed him the most
 ek-ek kitaab ke bare main detail main likhaa he
 One more special thing, Osho read everyone's writing, but never wrote a single word with his own hand
 apana sara gyaan usne record karavaaya
 All the books you see of Osho are written on the basis of recorded audio
 kya osho rajnish se dar gai thi america sarkaar?osho ne jin dedh lakh kitabon ko padhaa, unamem se hindi man likhi sirf ek hi kitaab shaamil he or vah he sachchidanand hiranand vatsyayan agyeya kii ‘nadi ke dweep
 'even though he has chosen a Hindi book, he has so many bridges of praise that it is better than the novels of Tolstoy and Chekhav
 osha ne ‘nadi ke dweep’ ke bare main jo kaha wo is tarah he ‘is hindi upanyaas kaa ab tak angreji main anuwaad nahin hua he
 It is strange that a man like me is referring to this
 iskaa hindi tital nadi ke dweep he, ye angreji main ‘islands of a river by sachchidanand hiranand’ naam se ho saktaa he
 This book is for those who want to meditate
 ye yogiyon kii kitaab he
 This can neither be compared with any of Tolstoy's novels nor Chekhav's
 iskaa durbhaagya yahi he ki ise hindi main likhaa gaya he
 It is so excellent that i would be more than happy to read it and enjoy it more than i can say anything about it
 itani gaharaai main jaakar baat karnaa bahut mushkil he
 'you are wondering what is like this in this book? This question is valid after so much praise
 to bhaiya aisa he ki is upanyaas main chaar mukhya kirdaar hai bhuwan, rekha, chandramaadhav or gaura
 They all keep wandering for their unfulfilled desires
 iskaa majamoon ye bhi he ki pyaar-mohabbat main ek-duusare se alag rahakar apane relation ke myne zyada thik dhang se samaj sakate hai
 Physically untouched relation is more beautiful
 osho ne jo kaha wo sab to thik he hi
 There will be some power in the book, then Osho said all this
 lekin iskaa doosraa pahalu bhi sun lijie
 Noted satirist Sharad Joshi, storyteller Priyamvand, playwright Mohan Rakesh all disliked the book, but rejected the unknowable
 sharad joshi ne to do vyangy bhi likh daale

 Now Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister n Chandrababu Naidu has also said that people are facing a lot of problems with this

 Chandrababu Naidu said, 'we did not want demonetisation, there are still many problems
 logon ko isse dikkat ho rahi he

 2ji ghotaale kii gaaj ab ek or kendriya mantri par giri he
 Dayanidhi Maran, who is handling the textile ministry at the center from DMK quota, met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and submitted his resignation
 sibiai ne kal hi maaran ke 2ji ghotaale main sanlipt hone ke bare main pukhta saboot hone kaa daawa kiya tha
 Maran had removed the red light on his car even before going to the Prime Minister's residence
 2ji ghotaale main ab tak diemke ke teen wicket gir gaye hai
 First came the name of Telecom Minister a Raja
 raja ko kursi ganvaani padi or abhi vah jail main hai
 After this, Karunanidhi's daughter Kanimoi's name also got involved in this scam
 kanimoi bhi tihaad jail pahunch gayi or ab dayaanidhi maaran ne istipha de diya he
 The CBI, while presenting its status report in the Supreme Court on Wednesday, directly accused Dayanidhi Maran in the 2G case
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki 2004 se 2007 ke dauraan telecom mantri rahete hue dayaanidhi maaran ne airsel ke promotor shivashankaran ko majaboor kiya ki vah apana hissaa ek malaysian company mexis samooh ko bech den
 Aircel did not get a UAS license for two years while Maran was a minister
 tang aakar shivashankaran ne airsel ko mexis samooh ko bech diya
 In December 2006, Aircel was licensed within six months of the deal
 dayaanidhi maaran aaj kendriya mantrimandal kii baithak main shaamil hue the, lekin vahaan unhone istife kaa koi prastaav nahin rakhaa tha
 When a minister was asked whether Maran resigned or proposed it, he did not say in response to the condition of anonymity
 vah 11 baje shuru hui baithak main kuch deree se aae
 However, Maran exited the meeting after the meeting was over

 reatin 4 stardiarector ravi udaivarkalakaara shridevi, navazuddin siddiki, akshay khanna, adnan siddiki or sajal aleebhagwan har jagah nahin ho saktaa tha, isliye usne maa banaai
 Hearing this line really brings immense affection for the mother and seems to sit in her area
 mamtamayi maa maa agar thaan le to apane bacchon kii khatir vah kuch bhi kar guzar sakati he
 This is the theme of Ravi Udayavar's film
 aisa bahut hi kam maukon par hota he jab bollywood kahani se lekar kairectorigeshan tak par apana dimag lagaataa he
 The director has worked hard in the film
 is baat ko isse samajha ja saktaa he ki kahani kaaphi swaabhaavik hote hue bhi, baandhe rakhti he
 This is Sridevi's 300th film and she has registered another great film
 damdaar kahani, joardaar treetmentkahani skool teacher shridevi kii he
 She lives a peaceful life with her husband and daughters
 lekin class main ek student teacher kii beti ko ganda clip bhej detaa he or teacher uske mobile ko khidki se baahar phenk detii he
 Just then the guy gets to talk
 teacher kii badi beti uske pati kii pehali patni kii he to vah khinchaav maa-beti ke rishte main dikhataa he
 But when her daughter goes to the party on Valentines Day, something happens to her that a storm comes in everyone's life

 From the night party to the life of youngsters, it has been kept at the center
 film kii kahani nirbhaya cond kii yaaden taaja kara detii hai, or rongte khadaa karne kaa kaam karti he
 Nawazuddin and Sridevi's Kamalashridevi have once again proved that she is a life-long actress
 film main agar kuch maukon par unki kanpakanpati aawaaj or uccharan ko chhod den or sirf unki acting ko dekhen to ve kamaal hai
 He plays the character of a teacher and a mother in such a jovial manner that he touches the heart
 screen par unki majboot maujuudagi dekhakar acha lagata he
 Nawazuddin Siddiqui's role is small but quite important, and it is his specialty that he leaves his mark well
 ve film main dariyaganj ke local detective bane hai, jise bundi kaa raita pasand he
 Despite the short screen presence, his character of DK is going to be in the mind of the audience for a long time
 akshay khanna kaa police adhikari kaa kairactor thik-thaak he
 The work of Adnan and Sajal is also good
 must watch he momfilm vishay aadhaarit hone ke baavjood kahin bor nahin hoti he or koi sir dukhaau sandesh nahin detii he
 There is no glorification of mother here, mother is in action here
 film ko must watch kaha ja saktaa he, or ek baat hameshaa yaad rakhana ki kabhi kisi ko mat kahana ki “ab bula na apni maa ko
