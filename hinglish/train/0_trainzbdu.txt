 In the changing political environment, Bihar politics is taking an interesting turn
 dost dushman ban rahe hai to bichade saathi bhi milane kii raah par hai
 Something similar is being said about the meeting of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav and former RJD MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav
 lagata he, donon ek baar phir haath milaane ko majaboor ho gaye hai
 Pappu Yadav, a four-time Lok Sabha MP, held a 45-minute conversation with Lalu on 10 October in Ranchi Jail
 aisa lag rahaa he ki donon ke bich samjhauta ho gaya he
 The aim of both is to prevent the Yadav votes from being divided
 bihar main yadav matadaataaon kii sankhya 15 fisadi bataai jaati he
 Though no one knows what has happened between the two, but according to sources, Lalu had asked Pappu about the Congress strategy in Bihar
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se thik pehle ek-duusare se dur ho jane ke baad donon kii hi buree gat hui thi
 Lalu expelled Madhepura's controversial MP Pappu Yadav and two other mlas from the RJD
 iske baad donon ko 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main uttari or uttar-purvi bihar main baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa, kyonki donon ne ek-duusare ke khilaaf ummidavaar khadey kiye the
 While Lalu's seats fell from 22 to 4, Pappu's wife and mother lost to Supaul and Purnia
 pappu kii maa shanti devi or patni ranjita ranjan baari antar se duusare sthaan par rahi thim
 On the other hand, RJD-LJP candidates lost all five seats in Kosi region
 pappu or lalu donon kaa janaadhar samaan he
 Voters were also divided as the two leaders separated and the NDA won a landslide victory in North Bihar
 mana jaataa he ki kosi kshetra ke jilon main pappu kaa acha-khaasaa dabadabaa he
 The differences between the two were such that Lalu had said in an election meeting with LJP President Ram Vilas Paswan and Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav, "pappu Yadav has cheated the RJD
" unhone gathbandhan kaa dharm nahin nibhaayaa or ab ve purniya main sampradayik takaton ko phayda pahunchane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 After this, Pappu could not contest the election after being found guilty in the murder case
 ab ajit sarkaar kii hatya ke maamle main bari hone ke baad ve may main jail se baahar aae hai
 On the other hand, Lalu Prasad is now in jail after being convicted in the fodder scam
 mana ja rahaa he ki lalu congress ko lekar chintit hai, kyonki congress nitish kumaar kii ore haath badhaati dikh rahi he
 Pappu Yadav's wife Ranjita Ranjan, who was a former Lok Sabha MP and joined the Congress before the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 ve ab bhi congress main hai
 There are indications that Pappu Yadav or his wife may contest against JD (U) president Sharad Yadav
 sharad yadav is samay madhepura se loksabhaa saansad hai
 Now in such a situation, in the 2014 elections, the coming together of Lalu and Pappu and separation between JD (U) and BJP can reverse the situation

 India Against Corruption (IAC) activist Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday challenged Congress President Sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi for a public debate on corruption, ignoring questions asked by Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh
 haalanki congress ne chunauti ko asweekaar kar diya
 IAAC activists, on the other hand, staged a sit-in at the Delhi government residence of Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday, accusing Robert Vadra and DLF of approving the deal
 kejariwal ne daawa kiya ki police lathicharge main kai pradarshkari ghayal ho gaye
 Meanwhile, Kejriwal had to leave the press conference when a former IAAC member questioned his own style of functioning
 kejariwal ne samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, "police ne kaaryakartaaon par us vakt lathicharge kiya jab ve shantipurvak haryana ke mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda ke ghar ke baahar pradarshan kar rahe the
 Many people have suffered injuries
 shantipurvak pradarshan kar rahe logon par police atyaachaar nindaneey he
 " kejariwal ke samvaadadaata sammelan ke dauraan us vakt naatakeey sthiti utpann ho gai jab ieesi kii purv sadsy ani kohli ne unki karypranali par prashn khadaa kiya
 Kohli asked Kejriwal, "when you ask questions to others, why can't they ask you questions?" kejariwal par janalokapal se bhatakane kaa aarope lagaate hue unhone kaha, "kejariwal ko apana najariya spasht karnaa chahie ki vah raajnneetijna hai yaa phir krantikari
 " is achaanak badale ghatnakram se hatprabh kejariwal kohli ko sunne ke baad bina kuch kahe samvaadadaata sammelan ko chhodkar chale gaye
 Kejriwal said, "I have never met Kohli before
" mere vichaar se use kisi ne bheja tha
 " kejariwal ne 27 sawaal poochne vaale congress mahasachiv digvijay singh se bhi kaha ki pehle vah apni party pramukh sonia gandhi or pradhanmantri manmohan singh se sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar ke khilaaf lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke jawaab dilavaayen
 Let it be known that a day ago, Digvijay Singh asked 27 questions about the financial assistance given to Kejriwal's organization and his government service
 duusari ore congress ne kejariwal kii is chunauti ko khaarij kar diya he
 Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Harish Rawat said that the Prime Minister cannot answer every issue and every person
 kendriya grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia ne iasi or kejariwal ke tareeke ko samaaj main anushaasanheenata ko badhaava dene vaala qaraar diya
 Reacting to the 27 questions asked by Digvijay Singh, Kejriwal said in a conversation with a TV channel that he would answer these questions only if Digvijay Singh was asked by Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh by anti-corruption activists Will answer you kejariwal ne kaha, "pehle vah manmohan singh, sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ko hamaare aaropon kaa jawaab dene ke liye raji karen
 After that i will answer their every question
 " Meanwhile, Arvind Kejriwal's aide Kumar Vishwas has challenged Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh to come face to face and debate
 vishwaas ne kaha ki digvijay janaadhar kho chuke netaa hai or unhen phaltu baat karne ke alaava kuch nahin aata
 Speaking on the question, Kumar Vishwas said why did Digvijay not ask questions from the Prime Minister's Office
 
 
 
 Digvijay Singh on Saturday asked questions about the foreign financial assistance received by an NGO related to Kejriwal
 kejariwal ne kaha, "ve hamase hamaare nijee jivan ke bare main chaahe jitne prashn puch sakate hai, ham unka jawaab denge
 After that we will ask them
 
 They also have to publicly reply
 "tippaniyan Kejriwal said that his organization raised questions on this alliance between the ruling party and opposition parties
 kejariwal ne kaha, "ve in muddon ko naitik aadhaar par nahin chipa rahe hai, balki bhrasht aadhaaron par chipa rahe hai
 i congratulate Digvijay Singh for accepting this
 unke paas bhaajapa netaaon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke saboot hai or bhaajapa netaaon ke paas wadra or digvijay singh ke khilaaf
 But a mutual agreement has been reached between the two

 After the resignation of the Yeddyurappa government in Karnataka, BJP President Amit Shah held a press conference today and targeted the congress-jds alliance
 shah ne kaha ki karnataka kii janata ne congress ke khilaaf jaakar vot kiya he or bijepi ko sabase badi party hone ke naate sarkaar banane kaa puraa haq tha, isi vajah se hamane daawa pesh kiya
 Amit Shah said that we have not done any manipulation
 agar bahumat pareekshan se pehle congress apane vidhayakon ko hotel or swimming pool se baahar chhod detii to janata hi unhen bataa detii ki kahaan vot karnaa he
 He said that the Congress did not even give its mlas a winning procession and a chance to celebrate
 agar aisa hota to bijepi apana vishwaas mat hasil kar leti
 On the allegations of horse trading by Congress mlas, Amit Shah said that we have been wrongly accused of horse trading but they have sold the entire stables
 unhone kaha ki congress ne gaiyr loktantric tareeke se apane saare vidhayakon ko hotel ke kamare main band kiya agar wo janata ke bich jate to unhen janata kaa mood pataa chal jaataa
 Even today when the Congress leaves its mlas outside, the public will ask for their answers
 sabase badi party hone par kiya dawapurna bahumat na hone par bhi sarkaar banane ke daawey par amit shah ne kaha ki aisi sthiti main sabase bade dal hone ke naate bijepi ko hi sabase pehle sarkaar banane kaa adhikaar he
 For this reason, we had submitted a claim to the Governor to form the government and there is nothing wrong in this, because if we had not done so, then there would have been a chance of holding a re-election
 jedies-congress gathbandhan par hamalaa karte hue amit shah ne kaha ki parinaam se saaf he ki rajya kii janata ne congress ko nakaar diya he or congress ko haraane vaale dal bijepi ko sabase badi party banaaya he
 BJP has lost many seats by less than NOTA and the people tried their best to give us a majority
 vipaksh ke jashn par amit shah ne kaha ki karnataka kii janata jashn nahin bana rahi he balki congress-jedies jashn bana rahe hai
 He said that the Congress had foreseen before the election that they were going to lose the election
 shah ne kaha ki congress ne chunaav prachaar main sari maryaadaaon ko todane kaa kaam kiya he
 At the same time, the Congress President himself has made false propaganda
 amit shah ne kaha ki yah ek apavitra gathbandhan he
 The Congress has supported the JDS by going against the mandate and the JDS has taken support only by going against the mandate
 unhone kaha ki donon partiyon ke netaa chunaav se pehle ek-duusare ko bare main na jane kya-kya kaha karte the
 Raising Congress's trust for institutions Attacking the Congress, Amit Shah said that after this election the best thing has been that now the faith of democratic institutions has increased in the mind of Congress
 ab congress supreme court se lekar chunaav ayog ke sammaan kii baat karne lagi he
 We want the Congress to retain its attitude even if it is defeated

 maamle main agali sunwaayee 5 may ko he, dekhte hai kya hota he
 'KDMC Commissioner Madhukar Andhad, said after the decision that we have started action immediately, the committee has been formed for garbage management

 Leading 1-0 in the three-match series after winning the first Test in Delhi, India lost two wickets in four balls in the final moments of the day
 inamen dravid kaa wicket bhi shaamil he jo craig brethwate ke karier kaa pehla shikaar bhi bane
 Apart from this, Tendulkar's wicket was also a positive aspect for the West Indies hoping to return, whose wait for the centuries to complete the century increased
 gambhir ke out hone ke baad krij par utre tendulkar ne shuru se pravaahamay ballebaaji lekin jab vah puri lay main ballebaaji kar rahe the tabhi westeindies ke leg spinner devendra bishu ne vah gend kar di jisase puraa stadium khamosh ho gaya

 unhone apni pari main 71 gend kheli tathaa paanch chauke lagaaye
 The inexperienced invasion of the West Indies did not leave an impact on Dravid
 unhone kemar roach kii nobal ko squaire leg par chaar ran ke liye bhejkar apane karier kaa 36waan, is saal kaa paanchvaan or eden gardens par chauthaa shatak puraa kiya
 The specialty of his innings was that he also hit sixes off Bishu and Samuels

 Rouse Avenue Court has reserved its judgment in the criminal defamation case filed against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 court ab 10 july ko tay karegaa ki is maamle main kejariwal ko aaropee ke taur par saman jari kiya jaae yaa nahin
 Arvind Kejriwal had made an objectionable tweet against BJP leaders in September 2018
 jiske khilaaf vakil rajesh kumaar ne aapraadhik manahani kii shikaayat court main darj karai thi
 Complainant Rajesh Kumar has recorded his statement in the court today (saturday)
 bijepi ke purvanchal morcha kii legal cell ke sanyojak rajesh kumaar kaa kejariwal par aarope he ki unhone bijepi netaaon ke khilaaf ‘aapattijanak / manahani karne vaali’ posts ko twit kiya
 This complaint has been made in front of Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Samar Vishal
 rajesh kumaar ne court ko bataaya ki vah kejariwal dwaara ek twit dekhakar hairaan rah gaye the, jisamen likhaa tha ki bijepi netaa deshbhar main ghumkar hindu ladakiyon kaa balaatkaar karte rahete hai
 Rajesh Kumar has said in the court that the tweet that Kejriwal had tweeted on 30 September 2018 has hurt him a lot
 kejariwal ne likhaa tha, “bhaajapa ke netaa puure desh main hindu ladakiyon kaa rape karte ghoomte hai
 
 ” unhone kaha ki wo usee vakt shikaayat darj karana chaahate the lekin sochaa ki koi unke twit ko gambhirtha se nahin legaa
 The complainant said that based on the tweet, on many occasions people have embarrassed them during the meeting
 rajesh kumaar ne court main lagaai apni yachika main yahaan tak kaha ki is twit ke baad socity kii mahila ne bhi taana maar diya
 The complainant has said that on the day of Hanuman Jayanti, a woman in his society taunted him, citing Kejriwal's tweet knowing that he is a BJP leader
 rajesh kumaar ne kaha, system main itane oonche pad par baithe kajriwal ne kai aise gaiyr-jimmedaar or manahani karne vaale twit kiye hai jisase shikayatakarta ko baar-baar sharminda hona padaa he
 In this case, a case of defamation is made against Kejriwal, so he has filed a defamation case against Kejriwal in the court
 ab takaraav khulkar saamne aa chukaa he
 Constant rages between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which formed the government with the largest majority in the last 30 years, and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has won an unprecedented mandate in Delhi despite barely four years old and only four seats in the Lok Sabha
 And the humiliating confrontation is coming a few weeks from now
 yah rishta hameshaa se khaas madhur to rahaa nahin he or vaise bhi arvind kejariwal kabhi pradhanmantri narendra modi par pehla nishaanaa lagane main chuke nahin hai, chaahe mauka kaisaa bhi rahaa ho
 Modi has never been above all this
 do saal pehle unhone arvind kejariwal ko pakistani agent, eke-49 kaha tha
 Last year, Kejriwal called Modi a psychopath and a coward
 tab se lekar aaj tak yah raag bina kisi sudhaar ke aise hi chhidaa hua he, jahaan twitor par bhadki halki-si chinagaari bhi bahes kii aag bhadakaae rakhti he
 400 crore against Kejriwal when Delhi's anti-corruption Bureau launched in June
 ke pani tanker ghotaale main ek apusht exiar darj kii, to kejariwal ne khushi jataate hue twit kiya ki modi ne ab sweekaar kar liya he ki donon ke bich sidhi jang he, ''mujhe khushi he ki aapane sweekaar kiya ki aapaki ladaai sidhe mujhase he
 "obviously, the battle will be mismatched as one's chest is reportedly 56 inches
" yah baat alag he ki kejariwal jis maamle main maat khate hai, uski ve apane jhagadaalu mizaaj se bharpai kar daalate hai
 AAP will contest in Punjab and Goa early next year
 donon rajyon main endie kii sarkarein hai
 Initial surveys conducted in Punjab show that AAP is on the path of victory and it may repeat the Delhi result 17 months ago
 masalan, hafpost-sivotor ke ek survey main aap ko 117 siton vaali vidhansabha main 94 se 100 ke bich siten milti dikhaai gai hai
 In other surveys also, AAP is getting between 85 and 100 seats
 kejariwal ne pehle hi daawa kar diya he ki goa kii 40 siton main se 35 par aap kii jeet hogi
 The party hopes that the decline of the NDA from Punjab and Goa will begin, which will further prepare the ground for elections in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka
 party ko lagata he ki agle do saal main in chunaavon ke bharose vah dilli kendrit choti-si party se vishaal rashtriya party main tabdeel ho jaaegi or 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav ke liye upyukt takat hasil kar legi
 With the continued decline of the Congress, the AAP is now emerging as the main opposition party of the BJP
 kejariwal aisa pehle se hi maanakar chal rahe hai
 One thing that comes up again and again in Kejriwal's speeches is that when Modi is not on a foreign tour, he stays awake all night plotting for aap's downfall
 unki daleel kaa aadhaar yah he ki aisa nahin he, to phir aakhir kyon modi sarkaar dilli kii aap sarkaar ke peeche padi hui he, jise pehle hi nagar nikaayon, up-rajyapal or centre ke saath apni satta saajha kerani pad rahi he? aap ke mutabik uske khilaaf chautarafa sajishein ho rahi hai
 Ashutosh, a journalist-turned-aap national spokesperson, told India Today, "all the attacks against us in the last few weeks have been the result of political rivalry
" bijepi or modi aap kii badhat se dare hue hai
 Which opposition is left in the country? We are the only party fighting Modi
 '' joseph hiler kii baat yahaan sateek baithti he ki aap sanak main hai, isiilie ve aapako chhod nahin denge
 See the record of the current conflict with power
 bijepi kii aguai vaali centre sarkaar ne dilli sarkaar dwaara paarit sabhi 14 vidheyak lautaa die, jisamen ek aap kaa mahatvakankshi jan lokapal bhrashtachar nirodhak vidheyak bhi shaamil he, kyonki ''prakriya kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya

" koi vidhansabha sadsy apane kaarykaal main laabh kaa pad nahin le saktaa or isiilie sansadeey sachiv ke taur par niyukt aap ke 21 vidhayakon kii vidhayaki khatre main pad gai he
 In defending his party, Kejriwal cited the past of Delhi's Congress and BJP governments, "when they do it is constitutional and when we do it becomes unconstitutional

 Tens of thousands of people flocked to the rally site Ranjit Avenue in the evening to witness the launch of this 51-point agenda, which, among many other promises, "create at least 2

" jaahir he, loksabhaa chunaav abhi teen saal baad hai or jaisaa ki purv british pradhanmantri herald wilson ne kaha tha, siyasat main ek haftaa bhi lanbaa vakt hota he

 Only four candidates remained in Punjab who could reach Parliament

 Kejriwal did not respond to questions sent by India Today on aap's national plans

 In Punjab, he did not take any questions from the media

 And it is necessary that the people of the state are ready
 '' talwaar khud ko ''chunavi sameekaran kaa chaatr'' kehete hai
 He said that looking beyond Punjab and Goa is only "speculation" because the party will take "eight months to a year to prepare for the booth level elections" and it does not even have enough workers
 Those who can go door-to-door campaign at the grassroots level

 Talwar, who looks attractive in a blue kurta, believes that the Punjab Lok Sabha election results, in which the AAP won four seats and garnered more than 30 per cent of the votes, proved that it cannot be considered a state miracle
 
 log kejariwal ko sakaaratmak badlaav ke vaahak ke taur par dekhte hai
 According to Talwar, taking the decision to contest elections in Punjab was "quite easy"
 '' pathak ke mutabik bhale hi punjab main aap ke sanghathan ke bheetar dhadebaaji thi or takaraav the, lekin party kii apil par isse koi fark nahin padaa
 Ashutosh, Pankaj Gupta and Dialogue and Development Commission vice-president Ashish Khaitan all explained in their own way what the party looked favorable for themselves in contesting elections here

 Punjab has been ruled mostly by Congress and akali-bjp
 donon baari-baari se satta main aate rahe hai
 By securing a second term in 2012, the akali-bjp alliance achieved a feat that had not been seen for nearly five decades, but because of this, the anti-incumbency atmosphere is very high and the state is struggling with debt, drugs and farmers' suicides

 Apart from this, the public is largely in a mood of revolt
 aap ke kai kaaryakarta apane gramin prachaar ke anubhavon se bataate hai ki unhone khaskar drugs se kitni tabaahi dekhi he
 AAP leader Kumar Vishwas released a music video last month in which the Badal family was directly blamed for heroin addiction

 He reminds of Manpreet Badal's Punjab People's Party that provided a third option to the voters of Punjab but ended in the 2012 elections
 aaj congress main uskaa vilay ho chukaa he
 He says, "you will prove to spoil the game more and more, like PPP
" '' ve apane vishleshan ke nihitarthon ko hi sochane par vakt nahin dete ki pipipi ne jo paanch fisadi vot kaate the, usee ke chalate congress kii 2012 main haar hui thi
 At the root of Amarinder Singh's trust is his close relationship with the people

 No matter how popular Amarinder is, but when it comes to the Chief Minister, people have placed Kejriwal in the first place in the surveys and sent Amarinder to the second
 tisare sthaan par sukhbir singh badal hai jinhen sirf saat fisadi vot mili hai
 a strange rumor has been circulating in the media that Kejriwal will be declared the candidate for the post of Chief Minister of Punjab as soon as the elections close
 india today ne aap ke jitne bhi netaaon se baat kii, ve sab is afvaah par khub hanse
 Kejriwal will still remember the word 'fugitive' and would not like to lose credibility
 yaheen punjab ke liye aap main netritv kaa sankat bhi najar aata he kyonki kejariwal ke alaava or koi dikhaai nahin detaa
 Those who know you closely, however, insist that Kejriwal's selection of Punjab for the post of Chief Minister can also be a reality as he is willing to show what he can do if there is no centerpiece around his neck
 Are able to get kuch vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki aap kam se kam punjab main to pratyaashiyon kii ghoshnaa ko taalkar abhi behatar sthiti main hi he kyonki aisa hone par sambhav he ki paise or achche sampark vaale vidhayaki ke icchhuk pratyaashee tikat na milane par duusari partiyon ke paale main chale jaaen
 Ashutosh disagrees
 ve kehete hai, ''vastav main maamla ulataa he
 It is beneficial to announce the candidates early because there is no confusion and they have enough time to make better contact
 '' unke mutabik pratyaashiyon ke naamon kii ghoshnaa charnon main july se shuru hogi
 The continuing decline of the Congress has made room for a new party or alliance

 Kamal Mitra Chenoy says aap's "concept" is not to represent itself as a secular alternative to the BJP

 Kejriwal has become a cause of concern for Modi
 ve unhen aise taane maarthe hai jo koi nahin martha
 The only concern for the supporters of AAP is that both the men make their party the same way

 Independent MLA Vijay Sardesai from Fatorda, South Goa, claims that you will not succeed in Goa because "the people of Goa want to solve their own problem
" unke man main yah bhav he ki kejariwal goa ko dilliwaalon kaa upnivesh banaakar chodenge
 "amarinder Singh also says something similar that the Shiromani Akali Dal and Congress have been here for generations with their traditional base" which would be difficult to disguise
 ''aap agar punjab or goa ke matadaataaon ko yah samajha sake ki kshetreey asmita, sthaniyata utana myne nahin rakhte jitna behatar jivan str pradaan karne ke liye ek eemaandaar vachanabaddhata kii ahmiyat hoti he, tab kahin jaakar uske paas vah karne kaa mauka hoga jisaki use talash he
 Eminent Yogacharya Swami Ramdev said that mentally ill people are caught in the clutches of homosexual relations and there is a need to open rehabilitation centers for such people instead of making laws at the present time

 But Delhi Police dismissed Madhu's allegations as baseless, without any evidence
 15
 Pramod Mahajan's strategic prowess saw his last climax in the December 2003 assembly elections in four states (delhi, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan)
 mahajan kaa jor tha ki party paramparaagat hindutv kii line ke bajaay vikaas ke muddon par aakraamak ho vot maange
 Except Delhi, the BJP came to power with a landslide victory
 16
 Then came the period when all the political pundit Mahajan's biggest bravado happened
 pramod ko laga ki puure desh main atal bihari sarkaar ke paksh main mood he
 In order to cash in on this, general elections should be held shortly before the scheduled time
 atal sarkaar ne sansad ko samay se kuch maheene pehle hi bhang karne kii sifarish kar di

 jon striton hauli apni kitaab 'bhakthi ke teen swar: mira, sur, kabir' main aisi hi sthapana ke saath aate hai
 At the beginning of this book, John Stratton Hawley called it 'an appeal to historical logic and prudence'
 vah apni pustak main shaamil kiye gaye in teenon mahanatam kaviyon kii rachanashiltaa or inke samay ke saath kalpanapurna, aalochanatmak samvaad ke mahatva par bal dete hai
 Such dialogues, without which the sensitive study of devotional sensations is impossible
 hauli apni pustak main mira, sur or kabir se jude vishisht sawaalon- samay, rachanaaon kii pramanikta, samvednaa kaa swabhaav, lok-smriti main unka sthaan-aadi par to vichaar karte hi hai, inke bahaane bhakthi-samvednaa se jude vyapak prashnon kii bhi samiksha karte hai
 The question of division of lessons from nirguna-sguna is also in front of them
 jon striton hauli ne apni is pustak ke bare main ek baar kaha tha ki main sabase pehle surdaas par kaam karnaa chahta tha lekin jab main purushottam agarwal ke sampark main aayaa, tab mere andar mira or kabir ke bare main jane kii utsukata badi or maine iske liye kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 Today its result is in front of you
 iske liye main raajakmal prakaashan or purushottam agarwal ko dhanyavad detaa hum
 Critic Purshottam Aggarwal said about 'three tones of devotion: Meera, Sur, Kabir', when we thought of bringing a series of devotions, my condition was that the work would be based on manuscripts
 khaas baat yah ki yah kitaab is kasuti par khari utarati he
 This is a very important and thought-provoking book
 yah kitaab bahut hi gambhir pariprekshya rakhti he
 This book will enrich contemporary history
 jon striton hauli kii kitaab 'bhakthi ke teen swar: mira, sur, kabir'
 His original work is the Hindi translation of 'bhakti Voices: Meerabai, Surdas and Kabir in Their Times and Hours'
 ise raajakmal prakaashan ne chapa he or anuwaad ashok kumaar ne kiya he
 This is the third book in the book series 'bhakti Mimamsa' to be published in the editing of Purushottam Agarwal
 is shrinkhalaa main pehle prakashit do kitaaben hai: 'nirgun santon ke swapn' or 'ramcharita maanas; paath: lila: chitra: sangeet
 'john Stratton Hawley's well-known books on India's devotional tradition are - a Storm of Songs: India and the Idea of the Bhakti Movement (horvard, 2015), Sur's Ocean (with Kenneth Bryant, Horvard, 2015), In Two Sur's Ocean (horvard Oriental Series, 2016), Surdas: Poet, Singer, Saint (primus, 2018)

 We have seen that this history, incidentally, is not blurred but it has a fundamental problem
 agar ham yah maan bhi len ki bijak ke mul sutara us vaachik parampara main hai jo isaki pandulipiyon se bhi puraani he, to ham is tathy kaa kya karenge ki pashchimi tathaa purvi paramparaayen ek samooh kii kavitaaon par aakar nahin milteen, jinke kosh ko ham 'vaastavik' kabir kaa pratinidhi maan sakate hai
 It will always be confusing, and when we look at the legends associated with Kabir's life, there are more complications
 ye kinvadantiyaan 16veen sadi ke antim varshon main ubharin
 Of course there are also those who say that they recognize the sound of their voice
 20veen sadi ke madhya main hue mahaan vidwaan hajariprasad dvivedi iske achche udhaaharan hai
 He presented a devotional form of Kabir which was accepted by many
 dvivedi ji kaa kahana tha ki unke vyaktitv ko brahman samaaj sudhaarak swami ramanand kii shiksha ne swaroop pradaan kiya
 Others also recognize the sound of the Guru's voice
 kabir ke geeton ke prasiddh gayak netraheen rajasthani kalakaar birjapuri maharaj kehete hai, 'agar kisi vaani kaa arth gaharaa he to beshak vah kabir kii hi hogi; agar aisa nahin he to vah keval nakal he
 'unfortunately, the Kabir that emerges from the singing of these songs is quite different from Dwivedi's Kabir
 isliye, jaisaaki ek vidwaan ne kaha he, yah kahana kaaphi nahin hoga ki ham 'kabir ko unke bol or unke sandarbh main hi len
 'who speak? Which references? Let us start with Swami Ramanand, because he is very important to connect Kabir with the dynasty tradition that defined him
 ramanand dwaara kabir ko diksha dene kii hasyaprad kahani unke santcharit kaa ek kendrreey tatva he
 The story is that Ramanand was going to do Gangesanan when Kabir did something that he bumped into Kabir
 ramanand ke mukh se foot padaa : 'ram!- kabir ne ise hi diksha kaa mantra maan liya
 Thakur found Ramanand in a poem translating the poems provided by Kshitimohan Sen and this convinced him that the Guru-disciple relationship was a historical fact
 lekin afsos yah he ki puraani pandulipiyon ke adhyayan se kahin bhi is kavita kaa pataa nahin chalata, or na hi ramanand kaa naam kisi or puraani kavita main miltaa he, jabaki yah apeksha kii ja sakati he ki kabir ke liye ve agar itane mahatvapurn the, to unka ullekh kisi kavita main miltaa
 Although Kabir's deep-seated Purushottam Agarwal and David Lorenzen disagree with this, i see no way to revive this association with the cultured
 ramanand behad kam pramaan ke saath kai sari samasyaon kaa samaadhaan kar dete hai
 They pause the broken link that links Kabir's Banarasi 'east-atheist side with the theistic devotional personality that is widely present in manuscripts that emerged in the Far West
 ve kabir ko vishisht math parampara- ramandi parampara- main sthapit karte hai or saath hi musalmaan parivaar kii unki prishthbhumi kaa sutara bhi thamaate hai, jaisaaki unke naam se spasht he
 And then later also associate them with conversion with the kind of devotion that some Brahmins call their own
 yah sab kaaphi saaf-suthra he, or kavitaaon main bahut kam pratidhwanit he
 i have to support those critics of the lower caste who believe that the contact between Ramanand and Kabir was merely a pious intervention - a way to cut Kabir from its roots
 nabhadas ne lagbhag 1600 main apni kriti 'bhaktamaal main kabir kaa jo chitra prastut kiya he, vah kahin zyada vishwasaneey he
 By the way, he is also committed to Vaishnavism and is especially Ramanandi
 yah sach he ki nabhadas jo saamaanya suchi prastut karte hai, usamen ve kabir ko ramanand ke shishyon main darj karte hai lekin jab ve unke bare main pratyaksh taur par baat karte hai tab tamaam panthgat jhukaavon se mukt rahete hai
 He says that Kabir rejected the six streams of rational philosophy and the idea that human life must follow a certain order, along with the Brahmanical formulas that define caste discrimination
 ye varnashram dharm ke muladhar the, jo ki shastreey brahmanvaadi chintan ke kendrreey tatva ban gaye the
 According to Nabhadas, Kabir was a voice of disagreement
 agar bhakthi nahin he, to yah sachche dharm ke bilkul vipareet he
 The recognition for which they are recognized is that organized religion is meaningless
 blaai ke mutabik, jo cheez sabase mahatvapurn he, vah he- 'bhakthi' 'tivrata'
 Due to his position in the society, it is not surprising that Kabir would have taken the same stand, and according to Nabdas, it is worth noting that caste was of no importance to him
 jaisaaki hamen keval kuch kavitaaon se pataa nahin chalata, ve musalmaan julahe the, joki haisiyat ke lihaaj se kaaphi neeche hota he
 Therefore, it is not surprising that communities in the same position as him consider him influential
 unke prashansakon main jat, punjabi kisaan hai jo sikh samudaay ke merudand hai or jo khud ko varnashram dharm ke daayre se baahar bataate hai
 But let us not forget that many other people - including Vaishnavas and Brahmins, of course - heard this call
 kabir kii kavitaaon ke praarambhik sankalnon se jo ek mahatvapurn sutara ubharta he, vah unhen prastut karne ke sandarbhon ke kaaran feekaa pad jaataa he, or 'itihaas' vaale kabir ko chhodane se pehle use uskaa shrey dene kii jarurat he
 This is the basic debt of Kabir to the community of Yogis known as Naths
 is samudaay kii sikh shaareerik parivartan kii takanic ke prati drushtikon main roopakar leti he, jo kabir kii kavitaaon main praaia: upasthit he
 This is Hatha Yoga - strict yoga for strict physical discipline
 blaai spasht taur par sweekaar karte hai ki unhone is aayam ko nahin chuaa he
 They describe it as 'the whole subject of Shakti energy' ('the Whole Matter of Shakti Energy')
 phir bhi, vichaar tathaa vyavhaar kii ek vyavastha (jise kabir ne kabhi shakti se nahin joda) ke taur par yah dharmik tathaa lakshanik suraksha kaa bodh (jise ham unke naam ke saath hameshaa jodate rahe hai) karaane main pramukh tatva kaa kaam karata he
 To realize this, let us revisit the oldest dated manuscript
 usamen ham ek aise kuen ke bare main padhate hai, jo ulataa he:dubhar pania bharni na jaai meri bahut trisha gobind bina na bujhiupar kuvata lej talahari kaise nir bharai paneeharinighyyai nir bhayu ghat baari gai niraas paanch paniharigur upades bharyon he nir ram sarni hoi na pivahi kabir
 The poem, starting with the line 'durbhar paniya bharni na jai', is definitely indicating about the injected semen, which has been injected towards the brain by yogic activity, possibly tantric action
 chunki is drav par gurutvkarshan bal kaa prabhaav nahin padataa isliye ise gyanendriyon (paanch panihaari) ke dwaara khinchaa nahin ja saktaa, or isi vajah se 'panihaari' niraash ho jate hai
 This fluid is mysteriously heavy, it captures the body
 aisa lagata he ki kabir ko nath yogiyon kii puri dincharya maaloom he- kundalini urjaaon ko niyantrit karnaa or is avasthaa main sukh kii anubhuti karnaa- kam-se-kam maukhik taur par- sab kuch maaloom he
 The surprise then appears
 ve ant main kehete hai ki ve is pani ko nahin pienge
 Are they denying extreme joy and ejaculation, as tantric people do? No, the words are not saying so; Rather they are saying that they are refusing to obey Gurus Upades
 ve, jaisaaki nath yogi kah rahe hai, is baat ko maanane se inkaar kar rahe hai ki :gagan mandal main oondha cuba tahaan anmrita kaa basa
 Sagura hoi su bhari bhi piva nigura ji piyasa
 
 
 kabir to ram yaa gobind kaa paan karenge
 Many of the poems from the early manuscripts we meet many times are from this Kabir - from a veteran who is physically active, a hathayogi, yet who attaches his identity to the subtle guru in his inner space, From the true Guru Ram / Gobind
 yah nath yogi aadhaar kaa bhakthi paath he- sahajata, swat:sfoortata or eemaandaaree kaa ek rup, jo ki isaki praathmik lakshanikta kaa kaam karanevaale shaareerik drav abhiyantranaa ke utpaada se zyada saral he
 This form of discipline — at least a goal in itself — is not for them
 aashcharya nahin ki ve banaras kii galiyon main bhare rahanevaale yogiyon ke bare main bol sakate hai :kaa nangain kaa baandhe chanm jau nahin chinsi aatmaranmanange phiren jog jau hoi ban kaa mirag mukuti gaya koimund mudaayen jau sidhi hoi sargahin bhend na pahunchi koibindu rakhi jau tariu bhai tau khusrai kyun na param gati paikehai kabir sunaun rai bhai ranm nanm bin kin sidhi pai

 Input: RJ Alok jharkhand main hemanth sorain ke netritv vaali gathbandhan sarkaar ke sau din puure ho gaye hai
 In these hundred days, the condition of the government is about two and a half curse in a hundred days
 darasal, gathbandhan ke maujuuda sabhi dal apni dhapli apana raag alaap rahe hai
 The situation is that with the formation of the government, a common minimum program was made for mutual coordination between the parties, but nothing like this was shown
 sarkaar banane ke samay hemanth sorain ne rajya ke sabhi vibhaagon ko 100 dinon kii kaary yojana banaakar kaam karne ke aadesh die the, lekin 100 dinon ke baad amal to dur sarkari vibhaag koi yojana hi nahin bana paae
 In such a situation, the state is already suffering from scams and corruption
 vidambnaa yah he ki har sarkaar apane kaarykaal rajdhani ke liye ek nae sthal kaa chunaav karti he, jabaki duusari sarkaar ke aate hi pehlewali sarkaar ke faisle ko palat diya jaataa he
 In such a situation, Hemant Soren, the youngest ever Chief Minister of Jharkhand, who is surrounded by problems from all sides, said in a special conversation with the web till date, 'the government does not want to work on a particular priority, because all the issues related to the general public Are required
 kaaphi chije bahut samay se rukii padi thi, use phir se punerjeevit kiya ja rahaa he
 It will take time
 aanevaale samay main janata ke hit se judi bahut si yojanaayen saamne aaengi khaastaur par gramin janata ko isse khaasaa laabh hoga or unhen vikaas kii muldhara se joda jaayegaa
 There are also things like the Panchayati Raj system being implemented strongly in these schemes
 'centre sarkaar ke khaadya suraksha bill par puche gaye prashn ke jabaab main unhone kaha kii yah bill jharkhand jaise pichde rajya ke liye bahut acha he
 Reviews have also been taken from the departments regarding this bill, which is quite encouraging and it will be implemented soon
 gathbandhan sarkaar chalaane main aa rahi dikkaton ke prashn par hemanth sorain ne kaha, 'aisa kuch bhi nahin he balki logon ne apane swaarth ke kaaran is chalaanaa mushkil bana diya he
 We are working under the Common Minimum Program
 sarkaar kii baaten sarkaar ke str par hoti he, jabaki raajnneetik baaten dalon ke bich aapasi baatcheet se hal kii jaati he
 On the question of deteriorating law and order in the state, he said that as far as Naxalism is concerned, it is the problem of the whole country and this problem did not arise during his tenure
 is par centre or rajya sarkaar milakar kaary kar rahi he
 It will take time
 vahin shahar main ho rahe aparaadho kii rokthaam ke liye sabhi jilo ke adhikario ko sakht nirdesh die gaye he

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is not facing much criticism from opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on the pretext of water logging in Patna, the capital of Bihar, he is facing more criticism from his ally BJP leaders, whose leadership Union Minister Giriraj Singh is doing
 abhi tak jalajmav ke bahaane kendriya mantri giriraaj singh, nitish kumaar kii aalochana main har din apni vaani se lekar soshal media par jijaan lagaaye hue hai
 Singh's supporters want to see him as the chief minister
 isliye giriraaj singh (giriraj Singh) ko lagata he ki nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar)or susheel modi (sushil Modi) ko nishane par rakhkar wo apane jivan kaa sapana puraa kar sakate hai
 That is why they have done a rebellious attitude
 udhar ab nagar vikaas mantri suresh sharma ne bhi apni zimmevario se haath ye kah kar jhaad liya he ki nagar ayukta tak unki baat nahin sunate
 But before this, when the Mayor of Patna, Sita Sahu tried to run away from his responsibility by holding a press conference, the trick was reversed because his son was giving every answer from behind and when media people asked how many pumps were bad and When she was spending so much money, she was peeping out
 bhaajapa ke adhikansh vidhayak bhi media se batch rahe hai
 However, Janata Dal United has made it clear in defense of Nitish Kumar that when you have the Municipal Development Department, how can the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar be held responsible if you are the MLA and Mayor
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki bhaajapa ke har netaa or kaaryakarta ko maaloom he ki jalajmav ke baad logon main sarkaar or apane jan pratinidhiyon ko lekar kaafii aakrosh he
 In such a situation, trying to distract the attention of people by targeting Nitish, that the officials did not listen to us
 lekin khud bhaajapa ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki nagar vikaas ke naam par jo baithken hoti thim or jisamen keval bhaajapa ke log or mantri hote the to kya vahaan haribhajan hota tha
 Second, a section of the BJP believes that leaders like Giriraj, Sanjay Jaiswal, Sanjay Paswan are trying to give the message that they no longer listen to Sushil Modi on the pretext of Nitish
 bihar bhaajapa main apane sheersh netaa ko chunauti dene kii puraani parampara rahi he
 Like Kailashpati Mishra was challenged by Inder Singh Namdhari or Tarakant Jha
 phir govindacharya ne susheel modi, nand kishor yadav or sarayu raay ko badhaayaa
 But BJP leaders believe that if Nitish and Sushil like Giriraj are targeting Modi together, then the backward voter sentiment of Bihar will converge with Nitish just as strongly
 vahiin janata dal united ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki nishchit rup se jalajmav se sarkaar ko sabase zyaada jhatka laga he lekin ye ati aatmavishvaas or nagar vikaas vibhaag main har din sahi dhang se monitering nahin hone ke kaaran itani karaab sthiti hui he
 These leaders believe that BJP leaders are definitely showing haste in taking the credit for everything and everything
 jahaan tak giriraaj or anya netaaon dwaara aalochana kaa prashn he, unka kahana he ki wo jis jati se aate hai uski gaaliyaan or virodh kaa nitish kumaar 2010 or 2015 main saamana kar chuke hai or chunaav parinaam bataate hai ki uskaa parinaam nitish kumaar ke liye manokul hua

 purv captain sunil gavaskar ne old traverd main chauthe test main pari kii sharmnaak haar ke liye bhartiya cricketron ko fatkaar lagaate hue kaha ki unhone england kii team ko takkar dene kaa jajba nahin dikhaaya
 Gavaskar said in BBC Radio's Test Match Special, 'india did not show any passion, the players did not show any commitment
 vah aasaani se out hue or bahut acchhee gendon par out nahin hue
 England only bowled in a consistent rhythm
 'cricket itihaas ke mahanatam salaami ballebaajon main shaamil gavaskar ne kaha, 'aap dekh sakate hai ki ek baar niraash hone ke baad unamem sangharsh karne kaa koi jajba najar nahin aata
 Former Indian wicketkeeper Farooq Engineer also criticized the Indian cricketers, saying, 'they were playing without any' passion 'and showed no passion to struggle
 'unhone ‘baari bharkam vetan’ paane vaale coach dancan flechar kii bhi aalochana kii
 The engineer said, "fletcher did not advise captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to field first after winning the toss
" 'bharat chauthaa test pari or 54 ran se ganvaane ke baad paanch maichon kii shrinkhalaa main 1-2 se pichad rahaa he
 The engineer, who played 46 Tests for India, told BBC Radio Five, 'this is embarrassing
 bharat ne apane pair par tabhi kulhadi maar lee thi jab unhone hari pich par pehle ballebaaji karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 He said that former England coach Fletcher should have advised Dhoni to field first instead of batting
 ejeeniyar ne kaha, ‘flechar ko kaaphi baari bharkam bhugtan kiya ja rahaa he
 Of course he can read the pitch and he should have advised Dhoni accordingly
 ' The Maharashtra Police along with Madhya Pradesh Police has busted a factory in Beed city where an illegal business of printing 100 and 50 rupee notes was going on
 praapt jaankaree ke anusaar bid shahar main kai maheene se 100 or 50 rupee ke hubahu note chhapane kaa kaam chal rahaa tha
 The paper was being brought from Aurangabad to print fake notes
 saiyad shukur shabbir naamak aaropee ko hiraasat main liya gaya he
 According to the police, Madhya Pradesh police got information that a person is illegally printing fake notes worth 50 and 100 rupees in Gandhi Nagar of Peth Beed police station area of beed city
 unhone tatkaal bid police se sampark kar isaki soochna di
 Police Superintendent taking this matter seriously
 shridhar inke nirdesh par peth bid thane ke police nireekshak anil jadhav ne shaikh shakur ke makaan par chapa markar nakli note chhapane kii kitaaben va dedh lakh rupye mulya ke 50 va 100 ke ke note jabt kiye
 The police have arrested Sheikh Shakur
 nakli note banane vaala giroh karyrat he kya? shaikh shakur se kis-kis ke sambandh hai, police jaanch main jute gai he
 Sheikh Shakur is a resident of Nalwandi village in Beed tehsil
 do saal pehle use ek apane rishtedaar kii ladki ke saath jabaran balaatkaar ke maamle main arest kiya gaya tha
 He was serving sentence in Harsul jail in Aurangabad
 usee dauraan shakur kii mulaakaat ek kaidi se hui jo nakli note chhapane ke maamle main sajaa kaat rahaa tha
 When Shakur is released from jail, he will also be involved in making fake notes
 keval aathvin paas shakur kii karatuut se donon rajyon kii police sann rah gai he
 a fake note factory had been in operation in Beed for a long time, but the police did not even know it
 aapako yaad hoga ki pichley saal disambar main mumbai ke loar parel ilaake kii kamala mills complex sthit van 'abab' restaraan main aag lagane se 14 logon kii maut ho gai thi, kyonki aag se bachaav ke liye vahaan paryaapt upaay nahin the
 Keeping the rules in mind, the restaurant was being operated, where more than a dozen people lost their lives due to the fire
 isi tarah se niyam-kaayadon ko dhata bataate hue pashchimi dilli main kai nijee aspataal chal rahe hai, jahaan aag lagane jaise koi ghatana hoti he to logon ko apni jaan bachaani mushkil hogi
 The Right to Information Act (RTI) states that private hospitals in West Delhi are not completely safe
 ye aspataal niyamon ko darkinar kar sanchalit kiye ja rahe hai
 As per information received from RTI, most private hospitals in West Delhi do not have a No Objection Certificate (NOC) of the Delhi Fire Department
 pashchimi dilli sthit zyaadaatar privet aspataalon ke paas fire vibhaag kii enosi nahin hone kii vajah se, ve chal kaise rahe hai ye sabase bada sawaal he? sirf kalra aspataal ko chhod den, to baaki sabhi privet aspataal asurakshit hai
 According to information received through the Right to Information Act, about 19 private hospitals do not have NOC of the Fire Department
 vahiin 16 skulon main fire vibhaag kii enosi nahin he
 There are not only hospitals but many banquet halls and schools which have not taken NOC of Fire Department
 artiai kaaryakarta parminder singh ne bataaya, "pashchimi dilli main rama road, main road najafagarh par jitne bhi banquet haul hai, unamem kareeb kareeb 30 ke paas fire vibhaag kii enosi nahin he''
 He said that after the RTI response to the school, hospital, banquet hall located in West Delhi area after the Mumbai accident, eyes were opened
 sawaal he ki agar durbhaagya se koi haadasa hota he to log jaan kaise bachaayenge, iskaa javabdeh koun hoga?kya kahata he niyam-kaaydaapashchimi dilli ke zyaadaatar aspataalon ke asurakshit hone ke peeche ek badi vajah he ki zyaadaatar building bylot ke hisaab se nahin bani hai
 For example, to obtain the NOC of the Fire Department, the hospital ladder should be 4 feet wide
 sidhiyon ke step 6 inch ke hone chahie
 Most importantly, they should have a pressure of 10,000 liters of water
 kisi bhi aspataal main pani kaa tanks, uchit ventilation hona sabase zaruri he
 That is when the Fire Department gives the NOC
 saath hi aspataal kisi gali kuche main na hokar 100 feet ke road par hona zaruri he
 But the reality is that hospitals are mostly built in old buildings
 niyam ke mutabik aspataal ke basament main store to ho saktaa he, lekin kisi gatividhi kii ijazat nahin he, jabaki, zyaadaatar aspataalon ne basament main resepshan banaaya hua he
 Ignoring the ban of NGT, illegal borewells are soaking water from the heart of Delhi
 yah jaanakar hairaani hogi ki dilli main ethjiti ne borwell kii khudaai puri tarah se pratibandhit kii hui he
 But RTI has revealed that around 74 illegal borewells have been found in West Delhi alone
 isse na keval dilli sarkaar ko rajasav kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he balki dilli kaa bhoojal str lagaataar neeche ja rahaa he
 About 74 borewells are running without permission in West Delhi
 30 banquet haul main avaidh borwell ke paae gaye hai
 Just think, in the cleanliness of a banquet hall, water from about 20 houses is used in the ceremony
 agar ye commercial borwell vaid hote to sarkaar ko kaaphi rajasav mil jaataa
 Parminder Singh says that when Arvind Kejriwal came to power, he had talked about corruption-free government, but today the Delhi Jal Board are running illegal borewells with money
 paak sena pramukh general qamar javed bajva ne ravivaar ko niyantran rekha kaa daura kiya or kaha ki unka desh kashmiriyon ke 'aatm-nirnay' ke adhikaar ke liye kiye ja rahe raajnneetik sangharsh ko samarthan detaa rahegaa
 Bajwa, who visited the areas of Haji Pir sector, was informed about the ceasefire violations allegedly committed by Indian jawans
 iske saath hi kisi bhi aakraamakata se nipatane ke liye pakistan kii taiyaari kii sthiti se bhi unhen rubaru karaayaa gaya
 The army chief said that Pakistan would continue to support the struggle of Kashmiris

 India has repeatedly rejected Pakistan's allegations of infringement of Kashmir's rights

 tippaniyan About 100 villages have reported damage due to rain and hailstorms in Madhya Pradesh during the last 24 hours, 4 people have died due to lightning
 in sabko dur rakhane ke liye bijepi ke purv vidhayak ramesh saxena ne hanuman chalisa kaa paath karne kii naseehat di he
 Saxena said, 'my most taxing prayer is, as scientists have said that there will be a natural outbreak for the next 4-5 days, hail will also fall and rain will also occur
 is prakritik aapadaa se bachane ke liye ek maatr upaay he hanuman chalisa
 Every farmer brothers are requested to collectively recite Hanuman Chalisa for one hour daily

 saxena ne kaha, 'meri sabase karbaddh prarthana he, jaise vaigyanikon ne bataaya he ki agle 4-5 dinon tak prakritik prakope rahegaa, ole bhi girenge or barish bhi hogi
 The only way to avoid this natural disaster is Hanuman Chalisa
 sabhi kisaan bhaaiyon se nivedan he pratidin ek ghanta samuhik rup se kisaan milakar hanuman chalisa kaa paath karen
 i claim that if you recite Hanuman Chalisa daily then this natural disaster can be dealt with
 hanuman dada aavashyak rup se hamaari sahaayta karenge
