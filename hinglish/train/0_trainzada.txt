 He batted highly disciplined and made lavish shots on loose balls
 record 108 vanade khilne ke baad test cricket main padaarpan karne vaale mumbai ke is 26-varshiya ballebaaj ne shillingford par bhartiya pari kaa ekmaatr chakka bhi lagaaya
 He hit his fist in the air happily after completing his century for a second consecutive four over Sheldon Cottrell
 iske liye unhone 194 gend kheli tathaa 12 chauke lagaae
 Rohit is the 14th Indian to score a century in a debut match for India and the fifth batsman in the world to perform on the Eden Gardens
 isse pehle subah shillingford ne bharat kii mashhoor ballebaaji linep ko jhakzorne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 He also took the valuable wicket of Tendulkar
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki shillingford ne sanyas kii ghoshnaa kar chuke tendulkar ko apane 'doosraa' se chakma diya, lekin gend unki jaangh ke upari hisse main lagi thi
 The TV replays seemed like the ball could have gone over his stumps
 bharat ne subah bina kisi nuksaan ke 37 ran se aage khelnaa shuru kiya or din ke tisare over main hi shikhar dhawan ke rup main apana pehla wicket ganvaa diya
 He played the ball going out to his stumps
 aise samay main dhairya banaaye rakhane kii jarurat thi, lekin shillingford kii gend khilne ke liye vijay aage nikal gaye or baaki kaam ramdin ne kar diya
 When Tendulkar came to the crease, he was welcomed by the audience of 30,000 with the echo of 'sachin-sachin'

 35 kg of gold is not used in daily work, so we have decided to put it in this scheme
 aapako bataa den ki isse pahalesiddhivinayak mandir ne 40 kilo sonaamodi sarkaar kii gold monetigeshan skim main nivesh karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 The temple is expected to earn an annual interest of Rs 69 lakh from this investment
 gauratlab he ki desh main bekaar pade 1,000 arab dollar mulya ke sone ko bazaar main lagane kii sarkaar kii koshishon ke bich sabhi kii nazren sone ke bade-bade bhandar rakhane vaale mandiron par he
 However, the operators of many of these temples fear that the melting of gold jewelery and items received from the devotees for the government scheme may hurt religious sentiments
 kya he yojana or prakriyagauratlab he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara shuru kii gai mahatvakankshi swarna maudrikaran yojana kaa lakshyamkaanon, dharmik sansthaanon or anya jagahonper pade anumaanit 22,000 ton sone ko vittiya pranali main laana he
 Gold can also be deposited as jewelery, but banks melt it and after checking its purity decide the value of the deposited jewelery
 bharat main har saal 15 agast (15 August) ko swatantraaa diwas (independence Day) manaaya jaataa he
 At the same time, Pakistan celebrates Independence Day on 14 August every year
 haalanki donon desh ek hi din aaazaad hue the
 Now the question arises that after all why does Pakistan celebrate Independence Day on 14 August (14 August) instead of 15 August? In fact, the Indian Independence Bill was passed by the British Parliament on 18 July
 is bill ke mutabik 14-15 agast kii madhyaraatri ko bharat kaa bantwaaraa hoga jisase bharat or pakistan naam ke do nae desh vajood main aa jaaenge
 There is a reason behind celebrating Independence Day on 14 August instead of 15 August in Pakistan
 pakistani itihaaskaar keke ajij apni kitaab murder of history main likhte hai ki in donon deshon ko satta kaa hastantaran vysarai lord mountbeton ko karnaa tha
 Mountbatten could not be present in New Delhi and Karachi at the same time
 iske alaava na hi aisa ho saktaa tha ki ve pehle bharat ko satta kaa hastantaran karen or phir pakistan ko kyonki bharat ko satta hastatanrit karte hi kanoon ke mutabik unki bhoomika bharat ke governor general kii ho jaani thi
 In such a situation, Lord Mountbatten transferred the power to Pakistan on 14 August while being the Viceroy
 lekin pakistan ko aazaadee 14 agast ko nahin mili kyonki indian indipedence act main yah taarikh 15 agast thi
 In 1948, the date of independence in Pakistan was reduced to 14 August
 is par alag-alag baaten saamne aati hai
 Many reports said that on August 14 that year, the 27th day of Ramadan i
e
 shab-e-qadr was falling
 manyata he ki isi raat dharmik granth quran mukammal hua tha or yah din kaaphi pavitra mana jaataa he
 After this, Pakistan's Independence Day started to be celebrated on 14 August itself
 kuch itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki 14 agast ko vysarai ke satta hastantarit karne ke baad hi karachi main pakistani jhanda fahraa diya gaya tha or isliye baad main pakistan ke swatantraaa diwas kii taarikh 14 agast hi kar di gai

 Despite the efforts of the government, the prices of arhar dal are increasing in most places

 Arhar dal, which was getting Rs 200 kg in this wholesale market last week, has now come down to Rs 165 kg, but still its sales are decreasing
 yahaan ke daal vyapaariyon kii daleel he ki keemat ghatane ke baad bhi retail treders arhar daal kharidne kam aa rahe hai, kyonki unhen dar he ki agar unhone ek seemaa se zyada daal kharidkar stock kiya to sarkaar unke khilaaf karrwai kar sakati he
 Due to the high price, people have reduced the quantity of lentils and due to this the demand has come down in the market
 daal vyapaaree vijay kehete hai, "logon ne arhar daal khaane main katautee kii
 
 
 New vegetables have also come in the market

 " yahi vajah he ki khudara bazaar se ye sasti arhar daal abhi dur he or thok main daam girane ke baavjood khudara bazaar main badhotaree jari he
 According to data from the Department of Consumer Affairs, between 19 October and 26 October, tur dal has become expensive in the retail market of 25 important cities
 dilli main ye daal 163 rupee se badhkar 182 rupee kilo ho gayi

 Cities like Ahmedabad, Kanpur and Jaipur are important among the important cities where the prices of arhar dal have fallen in the retail market between 19 October and 26 October
 ahmedabad main arhar daal 20 rupee prati kilo sasti hui he, vahiin kanpur or jaipur main isaki keemat 15 rupee or bengaluru main 10 rupee prati kilo kam hui he

 The Bihar government, which announced not to implement the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, has taken a U-turn
 alag-alag rajyon main alag-alag premier dar ko lekar rajya or kendra sarkaar fasal beemaa yojana ko lagu karne ko lekar aamane-saamne thi
 Suddenly, the Cooperative Minister of Bihar Government said that the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme will be implemented from the current session itself
 sahakaarita mantri ne yah bhi saaf kiya ki bihar sarkaar pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana ko vartmaan praaroop main lagu karegi
 Talking to journalists objecting to the Bihar government on some aspects, Cooperative Minister Alok Mehta said that the scheme will be implemented by ignoring the provisions of the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, which the Government of Bihar has objected to
 unhone kaha ki jin praavdhaan par bihar sarkaar ko aapatti he, uskaa samaadhaan agali fasal beemaa yojana lagu karne se pehle karne kii koshish kii jaaegi
 The farmers will be considered on the problems
 The date for taking applications from farmers regarding crop insurance scheme is set till August 15
 aise main bihar ke kisaanon ko hone vaali pareshaaniyon par bhisahakarita mantrine safai di or kaha ki adhikariyon kii tatparta se is samasya kaa samaadhaan kar liya jayega
 He said that after implementing the crop insurance scheme in the current session, the government will study how much the farmers will benefit from it
 is baat kaa adhyayan karne ke baad hi bihar sarkaar agali baar pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana ko lagu karne par vichaar karegi
 It is worth noting that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had lodged his strong objection to the implementation of this scheme in Bihar
 aise main jab is yojana main rajya or kendra ko barabari kaa anshdaan raashi dena he to phir yojana kaa naam pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana hi kyon? sarkaar ko aapatti is baat par bhi thi ki sabhi rajyon main beemaa ke premier dar main ekarupatha honi chahie or is yojana kaa 90 fisadi kharch kendra ko vahan karnaa chahie

 In the upcoming presidential election, there was a discussion in this meeting about who should be the candidate of the opposing parties to compete against the candidate of various ndas
 nitish ne is meeting main apane pratinidhi ke taur par jadyu netaa sharad yadav ko bheja magar unke khud is meeting se duuri banaae rakhane ko lekar vajah kuch or saamne aa rahi he
 In fact, Nitish had given a statement a few days ago about the presidential elections in which he said that if the current President Pranab Mukherjee is elected, he will welcome it
 patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue nitish ne kaha tha ki pranab mukherjee agar dobaaraa raashtrapati bane to isse acchhee baat kuch ho hi nahin sakati he
 However, there is a lot of disagreement among opposing parties about the re-election of Mukrapranab Mukherjee
 sutron ke mutabik 20 april ko nitish kumaar ne sonia gandhi se dilli main mulaakaat kar pranav ko dubaara raashtrapati banane kii vakaalat kii thi magar sonia gandhi ne inkaar kar diya
 Lalu Prasad Yadav, a close aide of Sonia Gandhi and Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo, also cleared the intention of not re-electing Pranab Mukherjee as president
 lalu ne pichley hafte hi spasht kar diya he ki pranab mukherjeedobaraa raashtrapati banane nahin ja rahe hai or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi jis kisi ko bhi raashtrapati ummidavaar ke taur par chunegi, vah ummidavaar unhen manjuur hoga
 It is obvious that Pranab Mukherjee is the first choice as a presidential candidate but the opposition party is not ready for this and that is why Nitish Kumar kept away from the meeting called by Sonia Gandhi

 BJP leaders do not want to leave any chance to surround Arvind Kejriwal
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki sisodiya ke bayaan se saaf ho gaya he ki kejariwal kii asal manshaa kya he
 Tiwari said that before the Delhi elections, Kejriwal and his party were singing the song that Kejriwal ran for five years and now in two years
 bijepi kejariwal ko pehle hi dilli main sarkaar main naakaami ke mudde par gherne kii koshish main juty hui he or bhrashtachar jaise maamalon par kejariwal sarkaar ke khilaaf aakraamak rukh apana rahi he

 He said that the intention of serving Delhiites by winning elections in Delhi was not only from the beginning of Kejriwal and his party, but he was looking to fulfill his political ambitions by fooling Delhiites
 ab ye saaf bhi ho gaya he
 Manoj Tiwari also resorted to Anna to put Kejriwal in the dock
 tiwari ne kaha ki anna ne kejariwal ko pehle hi pahchaan liya tha or kaha tha ki wo satta ke lobhi hai or ab anna kii baaten sach sabit ho rahi hai
 In Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party is not contesting the election by putting the CM candidate in front, but Sisodia's statement has given rise to speculation in which it was being speculated that Kejriwal could leave Delhi and join the cm's candidature in Punjab politics

 haa, ye baat sach he ki ab purush auraton se sidhe yah nahin kehete ki wo kise vot daalen
 But in the midst of all this, it cannot be denied that the increasing number of women voters and the attention given to women's issues in the manifesto indicates a major change

 com / 4nzlg3cjuz The national capital Delhi is under threat of flood
 yamuna nadi ke badhate jal str ke bich hathni kunda bairaj se pani chode jane ke baad yamuna kaa jal str chetavanee level ke kareeb pahunch gaya he
 Two days ago, one lakh 43 thousand cusecs of water was released from the Hathni Kund barrage
 iske baad jal str main vruddhi ho rahi he
 Yamuna's water level 202 on Thursday on the Old Delhi iron bridge
 86 meter record kiya gaya
 204
 5 meter he chetavanee straflad department se mili jaankaree ke mutabik yamuna nadi main chetavanee ke liye jal str 204
 5 meters
 khatre kaa nishaan 205
 33 meters
 gauratlab he ki hathnikund bairaj se chode gaye pani ke agle 72 ghanton main dilli pahunchane kii sambhaavna jataai gai thi
 The possibility of flood threat was then expressed over Delhi
 nichle ilaakon main chetavanee jarisutron kii maane to prashasan ne haryana or dilli ko alert bhi bhej diya he
 In low-lying areas, the administration has also issued a warning to stay away from Yamuna
 yamunanagar ke cachament aria main lagaataar ho rahi barish se bhi yamuna nadi main ufaan aayaa he
 Please tell that many states of the country are struggling with the floods at this time
 purab se pashchim or uttar se dakshin tak nadiyon kii vikaraal lehren tandav machaa rahi hai
 So far, more than two hundred people have lost their lives in the cheeks due to floods in the country
 31 disambar tak free analimited 4G data, lifetime free colling or roming jaisi sarvice ke baad bhi reliance jeeyo aakhir pichad kyon rahaa he
 This question is surprising, but according to research, Mukesh Ambani's company Reliance Jio Infocomm is unable to compete with other Indian telecom companies even after giving free data and calling to people for two months
 or shaayad yahi vajah kii company apane welcome ofer ko teen maheene or ekstand kar sakati he
 According to a report by City Research, despite the arrival of Reliance Jio, the userbase of Airtel, Idea and Vodafone has recorded the highest growth in the last six months
 21 november ko jari kii gai city research kii ekareport main kaha gaya he,'maujuuda sab data dekhte hue aisa nahin lagata he ki reliance jeeyo ke ofer ne apane launch se duusare maheene me duusari companiyon par koi khaas asar daalaa he
 All data from Airtel, Vodafone and Idea have seen the biggest increase in October in the past six months' According to the analysts, telecom giant Bharti Airtel still remains on top
 cellular oparations association of india ke matabik oktober main airtel ke customers main sabase zyada 2
 33 million raised
 iske alaava edia or vodaphone main kramshah 1
 43 million and 1
 12 million kii badhotaree darj kii gai he
 100 million customers will not be able to raise till December! Reliance Industries Limited Chairman Mukesh Ambani said while launching Jio in the country that till December 31, 100 million customers are the company's target
 lekin market research form motilal oswaal research kii report kii maane to disambar ke aakhir tak company 100 million customers jutaney main fail ho sakati he
 The reason for this is that the growth rate of Jio has fallen by 50%
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main reliance jeeyo ne 100 million customers kaa torget hasil karne ke liye sim kihome delivery shuru kii he
 This is probably the first time in the country that a company is delivering sim to house like pizza
 ye hai jeeyo ke fail hone kii sambhavit vajahen- free sarvice to mil rahi he,lekin 4G data kii speed main lagaataar giravat bhi darj kii ja rahi he
 Whether it is the speed test website or trai's speed test portal
 in sabhi ne aankadon ke jariye yah bataaya he ki launch hone ke baad se isaki speed main lagaataar kami ho rahi he
 In such a situation, customers will be disappointed
 - free colling to he,lekin kol conect ho jaae isaki guarantee nahin
 Generally, calling Jio to Jio is quite easy
 lekin jeeyo se duusare network par colling main dikkate aa rahi hai
 - Cannot use Reliance Jio without 4G handset
 gaanvon main abhi bhi 4ji smartphone dur kii kaudi sabit hota he
 Apart from this, people already have expensive smartphones, so they are definitely hesitant to get a 4G smartphone again
 - dual sim smartfonhone kii vajah se log reliance jeeyo kaa sim ke saath pehle vaala bhi number yuj kar rahe hai
 Because obviously you have to pay after the welcome offer and Jio's service is getting slow
 bhale pakistani sena or sarkaar bharat ke khilaaf aatankwaad kaa istemaal karte hai, lekin vahaan ke log bharatiyon kii tarah hi aman or aman chaahate hai
 Making a similar appeal, a Pakistani student has congratulated PM Modi by writing a letter
 bharat ke sabase bade rajya uttar pradesh main bijepi kii aitihaasik jeet ke liye 11 varshiya pakistani chaatra akidat navid ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko badhai di he
 In a two-page letter to Modi, Naveed said that the Indian Prime Minister should work for peace and peace between India and Pakistan
 unako bharatiyon kii tarah zyada se zyadapakistaniyon kaa dilajitna chahie
 According to Pakistani newspaper World News, Navid, a student of class five, said that PM Modi can help speed up the peace process between India and Pakistan
 paak chaatra ne donon padosi mulkon ke bich shanti or aman ko behad jaruri bataaya
 Naveed said in his letter, "my father once said that winning people's hearts is an amazing job
 mujhe lagata he ki aapane bharatiyon kaa dil jeet liya he, jiske chalate aapako upi vidhansabha chunaav main shandaar jeet mili
 However, i want to say that if you want to win the hearts of more Indians and Pakistanis, then you should take steps for peace, peace and friendship between the two countries
 "paak bacchee ne bharat aurapakistan ko achche rishton kii jarurathai
 Therefore, you should act as a bridge between India and Pakistan for peace and peace
 hamen bullate (goli) kii bajaay book (kitaab) kharidni hogi
 We would rather buy drugs for the poor than buy guns
 paak chaatra ne jor diya ki yah donon deshon par nirbhar he ki ve shanti ko apanaaen yaa phir sangharsh ko
 He then congratulated PM Modi for the bjp's stunning victory in UP
 lahore nivasee navid isse pehle shanti or aman ko lekar videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko bhi khat likh chuki he
 Indian officials had also responded to his letter
 bharat ne dakshin africa ke khilaaf paanchvaan vanade match jeet liya
 The star opener for this victory was Rohit Sharma (115)
 paanchaven vanade main kheli pari kaa intjaar na sirf khud rohit besabri se kar rahe the, balki team india bhi unke form main vaapasi kaa intjaar dakshin africa daure ke shuruyaat se hi kar rahi thi
 Now this innings brought Rohit's life to life, because there was a lot of pressure on him from successive failures
 vaise dakshin africa siries se pehle rohit top form main the
 But as soon as he reached South Africa, he felt like a snake
 rohit ne is pari se bataa diya ki jab wo rang main hote hai to unka balla aise hi hallaa machaata he
 When Rohit hits the shot, the boundary also gets smaller
 or jab rohit jam jate hai to shatak banaakar hi maanate hai
 Let me tell you, earlier in the 5 odis, only 47 runs were scored by Rohit's bat
 yani 9
 78 in 4 Test innings on South Africa tour at an average of 4, and just 40 runs in 4 odis before that
 yani dakshin africa daure kii sari pariyon ko jod den to is match se pehle 8 pariyon main rohit ke balle se nikle keval 118 ran
 He is also averaging less than 15 and during this time he does not have a half-century in his account
 vanade siries khatm hone se pehle rohit form main laute to bhartiya dressing room ne bhi raahat mahasoos kii
 Shikhar was scoring continuously
 or ab rohit ke rang main aane se team india kii ballebaaji kii takat or bad gai
 In India's historic win in the Port Elizabeth ODI, Team India beat South Africa by 73 runs and won their ODI series on their land for the first time in 26 years
 bharat ne chah vanade maichon kii siries 4-1 se apane naam kar lee
 This is India's first ODI series win in South Africa
 isse pehle bharat kabhi bhi is desh main vanade siries nahin jeet sakaa tha
 At the same time, this is Team India's first win at St
 George's Park in Port Elizabeth
 isse pehle is maidan par bharat kaa record behad kharaab rahaa tha
 Batting first after losing the toss in this match, the team Indians scored 274 runs losing 7 wickets in 50 overs and gave South Africa a target of 275 runs to win
 jawaab main mejabaan team 42
 He was all out after scoring 201 runs in 2 overs
 africa kii taraf se hashim amala ne sabase zyada 71 ran banaae
 David Miller contributed 36 and captain Aiden Markram contributed 32 runs
 bharat ke liye kuldeep yadav ne chaar wicket liye
 Yuzvendra Chahal and Hardik Pandya got two successes each
 jasprit bumraah ko ek wicket mila
 Lalu Prasad may be talking about an alliance with Nitish Kumar's party, but Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi has created a twist in the case by calling Lalu as 'sampanath'
 agar aage sab-kuch thik rahaa, to nitish or lalu ek baar phir se dost ban jaaenge
 Lalu has indicated alliances with JDU
 par idhar lalu ne nitish se haath milaane kii baat kii, udhar nitish ke uttaradhikari jithan ram maanjhi ne lalu ko 'saanpnath' bataa daalaa
 Lalu has made up his mind to have an alliance with Nitish, but it seems that JDU is still tight-lipped about Lalu
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki jab lalu ne 'kamandal' kii kaat ke liye mandalvaadi takaton ko saath aane kaa aahvaan kiya to, siem sahab ne ajeeb tarah kaa bayaan de daalaa
 Now, who knows, Bihar cm's speech slipped or the matter of Lalu came to Zumba
 udhar, lalu or nitish ke bich pak rahi nai siyaasi khichdi par bijepi chatkhaare le rahi he
 However, nothing is impossible in politics
 barason tak dushmani kii siyasat karne ke baad ek baar phir lalu or nitish dosti kaa gathbandhan nibhaate najar aane vaale hai

 khaas baat to yah he ki 40 fisadi se zyada musalmaan votaron vaale kshetron mand bhi camel khilaa he
 In some places, in North India, only from Bihar, Muslims got some shelter
 yahaan kii chaar loksabhaa siton arriya se argedy, katihaar se ensipi, khagadipha se algepi or kishanganj se congress ke muslim pratyaashiyon ko kamyaabi mili
 However, Muslims got the best share in West Bengal
 yahaan se sarvaadhik aath muslim saansad chunakar sansad main pahunche hai
 Four of them belong to Trinamool Congress and two each to Marxist Communist Party and Congress
 iske alaava jammu-kashmir se teen, kerala or assam se do-do or tamilnadu, andhra pradesh or lakshyadweep se ek-ek muslim saansad loksabhaa main aae hai
 All the parties of the big leaders who had gone bifurcation, who showed little sympathy to the Congress till the last time, suffered the most in this election
 sirf trinmul congress hi aisi party rahi jisane vakt rahete congress se kinaaraa kar liya tha, isliye use bilkul nuksaan nahin hua
 The fact that Muslims have traditionally won elections from these non-bjp parties also cannot be denied
 isiilie chunaav main jediu ke 20 se ghatakar 2 loksabhaa siton par simtane ke baad istipha dete hue bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha, ‘‘maine apane jivan main aisa sampradayik chunaav nahin dekha
 "so in politics, Lalu, a rival to his old friend and then an ally, kept the Muslims in view," i will not congratulate Narendra Modi
 ’’lekin in sabase aage nikal gaye mulaayam singh yadav
 After the defeat, in the party's review meeting, he snatched the red light of 36 ministers who were given the status of Minister of State
 party sutron kii maane to mulaayam ne baithak main kaha, ‘‘tum sabko yahaan baithne kaa haq nahin he
 Get out immediately
 or dhyaan rakhana ki apane pairon se hi janaa, baahar khadi lalabatti kii gaadi main baith bhi mat janaa
 There was also a furore, because Muslim mps in West Bengal got eight seats because there was not a lot of Muslim votes there
 madhya pradesh or rajasthan jaise rajyon main muslim matadaataaon kii sankhya vaise bhi kam he
 But Uttar Pradesh where 19
 5 fisadi muslim hai, vahaan yah sawaal bana hi rahata he
 If you look at the Saharanpur seat of Uttar Pradesh, then Imran Masood of Congress lost from here because his cousin Shajan Masood was fighting on SP ticket
 masood kareeb 70,000 voton se haare hai, jabaki unke chachere bhai ko 50,000 se adhik vot mili hai
 Nawab Kazim Ali Khan alias Naved Mian of Congress got the major reason for the defeat of sp's Naseer Ahmed Khan in Rampur, once the seat of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad
 5 lakh se adhik vot hai
 Apart from this, there is also reason for the fratricide in the parties
 pashchimi uttar pradesh kii sanbhal seat se sapa kii tikat par haare shafiq ur rahamaan bark ne aarope lagaaya, ‘‘ikbaal mahmud (mantri) ne puri takat or vakt mujhe haraane par hi kharch kiya
 Similarly, SP candidate Atik Ahmed from Shravasti seat in eastern Uttar Pradesh said in a statement, "mahmud Khan (SP MLA) was busy in winning his friend and Peace Party candidate Rizwan Zaheer and working for the party
 Where did they have time? ’’darasal, bijepi ne apni ranneeti main sirf jeetne vaale ummidavaaron ko tikat dene or muslim voton ko baantne kaa faisla kiya tha
 The bjp's record win cleared the way for Muslim ticketing parties
 aise main muslim saansadon kii sankhya itnaa kam hona ascharyajanak nahin he
 Mali's women's cricket team scored the lowest international score in T20 on Tuesday

 " a post shared by browncardigan (@browncardigan) on Jul 21, 2018 at 3:34 pm PDT global star hone ke saath-saath superstar rajnikant ko log unki saadagi or vinamrata ke liye bhi jaanate he
 Rajinikanth is an actor who has always praised talent and good work
 'rustam' ke relies ke ek din pehle rajnikant ne akshay kumaar ko film ke liye shubhakamanaayen di hai
 Rajinikanth, who joined Twitter in 2013, has more than 3 million followers on Twitter
 haalanki rajnikant twitor zyada istemaal nahin karte
 Nevertheless, he tweeted and wished Bollywood star Akshay Kumar for his upcoming film
 akshay ne bhi twit kaa riplai kar rajnikant ko shukriya bolaa or saath hi unase film dekhne ko bhi kaha
 Although Rajinikanth is not the first star to have tweeted for 'rustom'
 iske pehle salmaan khan, ranvir singh or sonam kapur ne bhi twit kar film ko pramot kiya tha
 Let us tell you that this story is based on the Nanavati case of 1960
 saath hi akshay kumaar ne apane kariyar main pehali barneval offisarka kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 Directed by Tinu Suresh Desai, the film stars Ileana d'cruz, Arjan Bajwa and Esha Gupta in the lead role besides Akshay Kumar
 raaj netaaon kaa saarvajanik rup se pornography dekhte hue pakade janaa aam baat ho gai he
 But i am not surprised at this
 na hi main attahas karte hue kehane vaala hum, wo pakadaa! ye bila shaq sabit ho chukaa he ki hindustan main agar aap mashhoor hai to samajhie ki aap shishe ke ghar main rah rahe hai
 The interference of common people in the places of influential and influential people has to be increased
 kisi bhi tarah ke mashhoor vyakti ke liye ab niztaa ko ek parade ke rup main istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 And what does that curtain cover anyway? That you like sex a lot? Sexual apps have dominated humans throughout human history
 sex ke prati yah saarvajanik aruchi ham par thopi hui puraatanapanthi naitikta he
 We all have a natural desire for sex
 yah aisa boj he jise ham pare nahin jhatak sakate
 Yet throughout history people have been caught in risky situations
 hamaare netaa is jhooth ke sangrakshak ban gaye hai ki sex ko bedroom ke liye chhod dena hi behatar he, yaa shaayad vahaan ke liye bhi nahin
 They preach what they do not follow
 darasal ham vahi hote hai jo ham chhipaana chaahate hai
 Those who do not have to pretend that they are religious leaders or who are not political figures can live peacefully because they have no risk of public revelation
 unhen hameshaa chaukas hone kii koi jarurat nahin hoti
 But this is the problem with famous personalities
 unhen apni hakeekat kaa raaj fash hone kaa andeshaa sataata rahata he
 They are afraid of coming into the public eye
 or phir bhi logon ko lagata he ki janpratinidhi vidhansabha main baithkar apane phone par ashleel chitra kyon dekhte hai? aisa isliye he kyonki taqatvar logon ko lagata he ki ve adrishy hai
 He feels that he is wearing a bulletproof jacket
 yah maut kii tarah he jo keval duusare logon ko aati he
 But things have changed due to pressure from media and civil society
 maidan ab barabari kaa ho gaya he
 People living in public view cannot continue to do hypocrisy
 naam or badanaami ke liye logon kii bhukh badi he
 As soon as you say that you are Mr
 or Miss Clean, you open the investigation doors
 janata ab kisi kii nangai ko dhankane ke liye tauliya dene ke mood main nahin he
 Now you cannot have laddus in both your hands
 aap yaa to gumnaam or surakshit rah sakate hai yaa phir mashhoor hokar kisi shishe ke aise ghar main rah sakate hai jisamen koi chhipane kii jagah nahin hoti
 Intrusive technology and a growing culture of tabloid journalism will make the public sector even more vulnerable
 dakshinpanthi dalon ke maamle main to yah vishesh rup se sach he jinaki mulya paddati vaastaviktaa main prachlan main nahin he-darasal vah kabhi prachlan main nahin rahi he
 But those in power work on the principle that the public needs to be saved
 is aadhaar par ve visheshadhikaron kii maang karte hai
 They ask us to move off shore while boarding the plane
 ve chaahate hai ki jab kisi bheed-bhaad vaali sadak se ve farrata maarthe guzar rahe hon to ham ruk jaaen
 They want us to stand outside so that they can get the best seats in the auditorium
 yah swaabhaavik hi he ki aam aadmi kaa samuhik gussa un par bhadak uthaa he
 Yet they will not remove this mask of higher moral authority
 pashchim kii tarah taqatvar logon kaa mukhauta nochana jaise-jaise rashtriya khel hota jayega, ve bhi hoshiyaar hote jaaenge
 In 1963, Christine Keylor Scandal in England sacrificed the post of then Secretary of War John Profumo
 tab se vahi jaani-pahachaani kahani duharai jaati rahi he
 It always tickles
 ek pratik ko dhahte hue dekhne se zyada rochak or kuch nahin hota
 This is the common man's 'aha!' It is long
 ahaa! to vah bhi mere hi jaisaa he
 You can also call it a way to relieve stress for a stressed nation
 jab tak log kisi singhaasana par baithkar yah kahana pasand karte rahenge ki ve hamase behatar hai yaa alag hai yaa pavitra hai to samajhie ki ve ise hi bulaava de rahe hai
 Similar issue is also there in my own industry
 yadi kisi tathakthith art movie yaa documentry main koi ghatiya cheez dikhaai jaae to vah kalatmak ho jaati he
 If a commercial film contains alcoholic photographs, it is awarded the title of C-grade cinema
 yah khel kaa hissaa he
 The celebrity will do some embarrassing act, the media will make headlines thinking that he is serving the public, and the people's hunger will be calmed by the next sex scandal

 The 2015 World Cup has begun with a bang
 australia jaisi bouns pich par ballebaajon ne jabardast pradarshan kiya he
 i feel that the bowlers are not getting much benefit on the ground of Australia
 2015 main abhi tak khele gaye paanch maichon main 2888 ran ban chuke hai jo apane aap main ek record he
 Not only this, the statistics show that whenever there have been more runs in the first five matches in the World Cup, India has done a charismatic performance in the same tournament
 aaj tak kisi bhi worldcup main pehle paanch maichon main itane ran nahin bane hai
 In 2015 World Cup, every team batting first has scored more than 300 runs so far
 2015 worldcup ke pehle match main newzealand ne srilanka ke khilaaf 331 ran banaae
 In the second match, Australia scored a huge score of 342 against England, in the third match south-africa scored 339 against Zimbabwe, while India scored 300 against Pakistan and in today's match west-indies scored Ireland
 304 runs against
 aise main dekha jaae to pehle batting karne vaali team ne kaaphi acha pradarshan kiya
 The team batting first in the first five matches has scored 1616 runs at an average of 323
 baad main batting karne vaali team ne 254 kii ausat se 1272 ran banaae hai
 In five matches, the team batting first has won four times, while the team batting later has won only once
 aaj ireland ne 304 ran kaa peechha karte hue west-indies ko haraa diya he
 If seen from the perspective of history, the first five matches of 10 World Cups played between 1975 and 2011 i
e
 19803 runs have been scored in 50 matches at an average of 396, but this time the average of five matches played is close to 577 runs, which is Is a record
 1979 main england main khele gaye worldcup ke pehle paanch match main sabase kam ran bane the
 At that time, the most dangerous bowler in every team was not allowing the batsmen to dominate
 sabase khatarnaak gendbaaj west-indies kii team main the, jisaki vajah se west-indies worldcup jeetta tha
 In 1979, no team had scored more than 200 runs in the first five matches
 chaahe vah pehle ballebaaji karte hue ho yaa baad main
 In 1979, only 1726 runs were scored in the first five matches at an average of 345
 2015 world cap se pehle jo worldcup main pehle paanch match main sabase zyada ran bane the, vah hai 1983 kaa worldcup jo england main khel gaya tha, jisamen pehle paanch match main 2742 ran bane the or bharat ne kapil dev kii captaini main yah worldcup jeeta tha
 1987 World Cup which was played in India and Pakistan
 is worldcup ke pehle paanch match main 2487 ran bane the or bharat semi-final tak pahunchaa tha or 2002-03 worldcup jo south africa or zimbabwe main khel gaya tha, is worldcup main pehle paanch match main 2332 ran bane the or bharat final tak pahunchaa tha or 2011 main pehle paanch match main 2269 ran bane the or bharat ne mahendra singh dhoni kii captaini main worldcup jeeta tha
 So we can assume that in the first five matches in the World Cup, more runs have been scored, India has done very well in that World Cup
 hamen ummid karnaa chahie ki 2015 ke worldcup main bhi bharat acha pradarshan karegaa

 There is a very shocking revelation about Ram Rahim and Honeypreet
 dere ke ek purv sevadaar ne sansanikhej khulaasa kiya he ki ram rahim apni haniprit se ek baccha chahta tha, jise wo dere pramukh banaae
 Former serviceman Gurdas Singh Toor alleges that the idea was from Honeypreet herself
 wo nahin chaahati thi ki ram rahim ke baad deraa kaa utana bada samrajya uske bete jasmit singh insaan ko mili
 According to Gurdas Singh Toor, after Ram Rahim, Honeypreet's dominance in the camp had become like number two, so she wanted Ram Rahim and her children to be the head of the camp
 ram rahim bhi iske liye raji tha or chahta tha ki bachche ke pita kaa naam duniya kii najaron main vishwaas gupta hi rahe, lekin unki chaal bhaanp kar vishwaas ne pehle hi talaak lekar inke armaanon par pani pher diya
 At the same time, another witness of this case has come to the fore, who is the witness of the night when Honey Baba went to Baba's cave for the first time after marriage
 ram rahim ke driver rahe khatta singh ke bete gurdas singh haniprit or baba ke rishton ke ek ahm chashmadid hai
 Ram Rahim got Honeypreet married
 uske fouran baad ek raat haniprit ko apni gupha main rahane ke liye bula liya
 Gurdas was stationed outside the cave that night
 gurdas singh ko us roj pehali baar shaq hua tha ki ram rahim haniprit ke saath kuch galat karne ja rahaa he
 The next morning Honeypreet came out crying from Baba's cave
 un dinon khud haniprit ke dada dere ke khajaanji hua karte the
 Honeypreet went directly to Dada
 uski ye haalat dekh kar uske dada ne dere main kaaphi hangaamaa kiya
 Ram started speaking openly against Rahim
 lekin unhen chup kara diya gaya
 Immediately after this incident, he left his family and left for Fatehabad
 lekin baba ke kuch gurgon ne haniprit kaa peechha kiya or hathiyaaron ke dam par use raste main hi ek dhabas se uthaa kar dere par waapas le aae
 It is said that on that day, Honeypreet swore that she would destroy Baba
 gurdas ko ab lagata he ki ram rahim kii tabaahi ke peeche shaayad haniprit kii wo kasam hi he

 in / Famous director Karimuddin Asif has been among the few who made a few films, but did such work that he is still remembered today
 ke asif ne apane kariyar main 3 filmein nirdeshit kin
 One of which could not even be completed
 ke asif apane kaam karne ke andaaj ke liye mashhoor hai
 The popularity that he got from mughal-e-azam, a lot of people could never achieve even in his entire career
 asif ne mughal e ajam se 15 saal pehle ''phool'' naam kii film banaai thi
 He also produced "love and God", which remained incomplete
 ye film 23 saal baad 1986 main relies ho saki
 Asif was born on 14 June 1922 and died on 9 March 1971
 ke
 Asif's first film could not do anything special, but the second film 'mughal-e-azam' made history
 ‘mogul-e-aazam’ ko banane main 14 saal lage the
 This film started at a time when we had British rule here
 shaayad ye ek kaaran bhi ho saktaa he jiske chalate isko banane main itnaa vaqt laga
 It was the most expensive film of that era

 5 crores is said to be Rs
 jo us samay ke hisaab se bahut zyada maani jaati he
 10 lakh rupees were spent in filming a song from the film 'pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya', that was the amount of the era in which a complete film would be made
 105 gaanon ko riject karne ke baad naushaad sahab ne ye gaanaa chunaa tha
 This song was sung by Lata Mangeshkar in the bathroom of the studio, as she could not find the melody or resonance that she needed for that song in the recording studio

 He did not watch movies, but was fond of watching plays and often used to go to the opera house, where Prithviraj Kapoor used to play

 to unhone hi shapurji se asif kii tarif karte hue kaha, aapke paas bahut paisa he or aapke jaisaa shaks hi asif jaise pagal aadmi ko finance kar saktaa he
 i do not know how many years and how much money will be spent, but i can say with much confidence that it will make the film unprecedented
 ’prithviraj ke kehane par shapurji film ke financer bane or tab film ko paisa milanaa shuru hua
 By the way, a story behind the interest of Shapoorji is that Shapoorji was crazy about Akbar's personality
 asif to saleem-anaarakali kii mohabbat ke kaayal the, jisaki vajah se unhone film bananaa shuru kiya, lekin shapurji kii dilchaspee akbar kii vajah se jaagi thi
 However, Shapoorji was not the only financier of the film

 Cricket is considered as a religion in India
 cricket ke sabase bade chehre ke peeche puraa desh chalata he, har koi uskaa divaana hota he
 In the year 2017, this crush and passion for a cricketer continued
 wo hai bhartiya cricket team ke captain viraat kohli
 Perhaps due to this madness, Virat Kohli is emerging as a better batsman and captain day by day
 2017 ke hamaare sportsperson of da year bhi wo hi hai
 This year was completely named after Virat Kohli
 saal kii shuruyaat hui unhen purna rup se sabhi formet main bhartiya team kii captaini ke saath or saal kaa ant hua unki shaadi ke saath
 Virat married Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma in early December
 khel kii baat karen to chaahe ho wo vanade ho, tii-20 yaa phir test viraat kaa balla, viraat kaa captaini kaa dimag kaa har jagah bolbalaa rahaa he
 Virat has named every record
 saal ke bich main coach mudde ko lekar kuch khatas ai, is dauraan viraat kii aalochana bhi kii gai
 But Virat's bat silenced all critics
 viraat 2017 main ek safal ballebaaj, safal captain banakar ubhare, unki is kaabiliyat ko cricket kii sabase badi megzin kahi jane vaale wisden ne bhi sammanit kiya
 Wisden placed Virat on the cover of his magazine
 aisa karne vaale viraat purv mahaan khilaadi sachin ke baad duusare bhartiya khilaadi bane
 Speaking of statistics, Virat Kohli scored 2818 runs in international cricket this year
 ek calendar year main kisi bhi bhartiya ke dwaara banaae gaye ye abhi tak ke sabase zyada ran hai
 Kohli became the third batsman in the world to score the most runs by any batsman in a calendar year
 unase aage ab sirf srilanka ke kumaar sangakaara or australia ke purv captain riki poting hi rah gaye the
 Virat kohlitest in 2017 - 1059 runs, 75 average

 73agar test maichon ke pradarshan kii baat karen to viraat kohli kaa balla puure saal bolaa he
 He hit three double centuries this year
 kohli ke test maichon main kul 6 dohare shatak ho gaye hai, ye sabhi shatak unhone bataur captain maare hai
 Kohli has reached number one in the world as a captain who scored a double century
 haal hi main kheli gai srilanka ke khilaaf test series main unhone lagaataar do pariyon main do dohare shatak jade jo bhi ek record hi he
 any Indian 
 haalanki, ye donon khilaadi ab sanyas le chuke hai iskaa matlab kohli jald hi inase bhi aage nikal sakate hai
 Also, the six double centuries that Kohli has scored are much less than these two batsmen

 june main champions trophy final main pakistan ke haathon haar ke baad team main vivaad hua
 The feud led to a feud between captain Virat Kohli and the then coach Anil Kumble
 isi kaaran kumble ne coach pad se istipha de diya tha, jisase saamne aayaa tha ki viraat or kumble ke bich kuch bhi thik nahin tha
 Virat Kohli constantly insisted on making Ravi Shastri the coach
 is vivaad ke dauraan viraat kohli kii kaaphi aalochana hui, media or purv khilaadiyon ne kohli ke ravaiye ko galat tehraaya
 After which some big faces also gave interviews for the post of coach of Team India
 par ant main captain viraat kohli kii hi chali, or ravi shastri team india ke coach bane
 The year 2017 has already said goodbye
 ab baari 2018 kii he, uske baad 2019 kaa world cap he

 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav and his entire family may face difficulties in the alleged soil scam in Bihar
 rajya ke mukhya sachiv anjani kumaar ne van evam paryaavaran vibhaag se is maamle kii jaanch kar report dene ko kaha he
 The Chief Secretary has sought immediate information from officials about the entire tender process and its allocation
 bataa den ki bihar ke purv up mukhyamantri or bijepi vidhanmandal dal ke netaa susheel kumaar modi ne lalu ke parivaar par mitti ghotaalaa karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 He alleged that the soil which is being filled in Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park is being removed from the mall being built by the family of RJD supremo
 kya he puraa maamla
 
 
 According to the allegations, Bihar's largest stock is being made in the capital Patna
 is mal kii maalik dilite marketing company privet limited he
 The company has the elder son of RJD president k Lalu Prasad and state environment and forest minister Tej Pratap Yadav, younger son and deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav and his daughter Chanda Yadav
 is tarah aaropon ke mutabik is mal kaa maalik lalu prasad yadav kaa parivaar hi he
 According to Modi, Meridian Construction (india) Ltd, a company of rjd's Sursand MLA Syed Abu Dauzana, is building this shopping mall
 nabbe lakh kaa phaaydadilite marketing company privet limited main tej pratap yadav, tejasvi yadav or chanda yadav ko 20 june 2014 ko nideshak banaaya gaya
 It is alleged that the soil of the largest mall in Bihar was purchased by the Environment and Forest Department for 90 lakh rupees without extracting the tender
 is tarah modi ke mutabik mitti ghotaale kaa puraa phayda argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ke parivaar ko mila
 Lalu is also a role! According to BJP leader Modi, this is the same company about which the current Water Resources Minister of Bihar, Rajeev Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, alleged in the year 2008 that the then Railway Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav Nerelway misplaced the two hotels in Keranchi and Puri
 Sold the hotel to Harsh Kochhar of Sujatha
 iske badale main kochar ne dilite marketing company ko ek hi din main das nibandhan ke jariye patna main do acre jameen hastantarit kii thi
 That is, in this whole case, the wires are connected to Lalu Prasad Yadav somewhere
 bina tender ke hui kharid mal ke basament kii mitti ko khapaane ke liye kaaphi chaturaai se paryaavaran evam van vibhaag ne patna ke sanjay gandhi jaivik udyaan ke saundaryikaran ke naam par bina tender nikaale keval kotesan ke aadhaar par 90 lakh rupee main mitti kharid lee or yah kaam rupaspur ke virendra yadav kii company emes interprijej se karavaaya gaya
 The minister of the house and his own department did not need so much soil in the state, but the soil of the shopping mall had to be fixed, so a tender of 90 lakh was given
 is mal kii mitti ko bikwane ke liye saundaryikaran ke naam par anaavashyak rup se 90 lakh rupye kii mitti kharidne kaa anumaan pagadendi banane ke naam par kiya gaya
 In this way, Lalu Prasad's family has earned 90 lakhs by selling the soil of his mall in his own department
 yah udyaan paryaavaran evam van vibhaag ke antargat aata he or is vibhaag ke mantri lalu prasad yadav ke bade putr tejpratap yadav hai
 What happened in the country, the world, the metropolis, sports, economic and Bollywood

 Akhilesh arrived at an event in Shikohabad in Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan unhone anuchhed 370 se lekar jansankhya niyantran jaise mahatvapurn muddon par centre kii modi sarkaar par kai sawaal daage
 He said that the Bharatiya Janata Party has found a good way to control the population
 bhaajapa kii sarkaar naujavaanon ko naukari nahin de rahi
 In such a situation, unemployed youth will not be able to get married and population control will happen automatically
 is dauraan akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki sarkaar ne anuchhed 370 ko hataa diya lekin kisi bhi haalat main pioke yani paak adhikrut kashmir par kabja nahin kar sakate, kyonki kisi ke changul main fansi hui jameen ko kisi bhi haalat main waapas nahin liya ja saktaa
 Akhilesh Yadav took a dig at the previous statements made by the central government on the pok and said that the government has ruined the country
 yah sarkaar 110 karod logon ke liye kaam nahin kar rahi balki 20 karod logon ke liye kaam kar rahi he
 Akhilesh Yadav openly responded to Aaj Tak's questions
 chidambaram kii jamaanat yachika khaarij kar di he or ED unki talash kar rahi he
 In response to this question, Akhilesh said that if a government falls behind, then a battle of paper will have to be fought
 sarkaar ke paas sab takatein hai, police, fouj or anya vibhaag sab sarkaar ke paas hai
 In such a situation, to fight the government will have to be strong on paper

 lekin wo aarakshan kisko dena chaahate hai, jo aabaadi main garib he, jo jati se pichde hai, dalit hai, adivasee hai, yaa phir unka aarakshan chhinana chaahate hai
 RSS and the people of the Bharatiya Janata Party should decide this first
 kashmir se dhara 370 hataane par aap kya kahenge? is par purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki ab kya pratikriya karen, loktantr main logon kii baat sunani chahie
 What will happen to you tomorrow? This is our federal system, where the states have their own rights
 kal ko upi main kuch ho jaae to kya kar lenge aap?upi main mantrimandal vistaar par aap kya kahenge?jawaab main akhilesh ne kaha ki mantriyon ko badalane se sarkaar ke kaamkaaj nahin badalte
 These ministers will take 6 months to learn, by then the time of the government will be over
 uttar pradesh hatya pradesh he aapane manch se kaha tha
 
 
 On this, he said that if there are murders in Allahabad and your own journalist partner is killed, there are frequent incidents of murder in the state and from molesting daughters to rape cases, kidnappings have increased
 If you are, what will you call Uttar Pradesh? petrol-dijal ke daam bad gaye hai
 On this, Akhilesh said that this same money is being collected which was sent to the account of farmers in the elections
 jansankhya niyantran ko lekar sarkaar kanoon banane kii soch rahi he
 On this, Akhilesh Yadav said that i do not know what the people of Bharatiya Janata Party want
 unhen noujvaan logon ko naukari deni chahie, kyonki naukari nahin milegi to berozegaar yuvaaon kii shaadi nahin hogi
 In such a situation the population will be controlled automatically
 bijepi ne jansankhya niyantran ko lekar ye tarika acha nikaala he

 The BJP cannot work on the ideals and ideals of the Congress
 Today Congress wants to make the RSS a symbol of the country, it is not possible: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has retaliated on a statement of Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Sonia Gandhi Gandhi Jayanti
 bijepi ke pravaktaa nalin kohli ne kaha ki tasveeron ke aadhaar par kaam karne vaali congress aadarshon or vichaar par kaam nahin kar sakati
 The Congress does not accept PM like Narasimha Rao and forget to accept the national symbol
 congress ne kii tasviir par raajnneetih bijepinalin kohli ne kaha ki congress ne jeevanabhar mahatma gandhi kii tasviir par raajnneeti kii he
 We have always done politics of thought
 jabaki piem narendra modi ne swatchta se lekar swasthya ko lekar desh kii janata ke kaam kiya
 BJP has always done politics of nationalism
 unhone kaha ki congress ne hameshaa mahatma gandhi ke naam kaa istemaal kiya he
 The Congress started every government scheme in the name of Rajiv Gandhi, Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru
 ham par aarope lagane se pehle congress apni girebaan main jhankkar dekhe
 The Congress never sees anything outside the Gandhi family

 On behalf of the party, spokesperson Nalin Kohli said that Congress has always acted on the basis of photographs
 usne kabhi bhi aadarshon or vichaar par kaam nahin kiya
 The Congress has so far forgotten to talk about the national symbol that PV Narasimha Rao did not even recognize as Prime Minister
 sonia gandhi ne kaha ki aaj mahilaayein surakshit nahin he, jo log satta main hai wo kahin bhi aparaadh kar rahe hai
 Gandhiji preferred love over hatred
 vah loktantr ke samarthak the na ki taanaashaahee ke

 After establishing a 'direct connection' between the blasts that took place three months ago in the pilgrimage Bodh Gaya and the Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Patna, investigators claim that the orders for these two terrorist incidents came directly from Pakistan, where Riyaz Bhatkal, considered the founder of the Indian Mujahideen (IM), now lives
 jaanchakartaaon kaa daawa he ki unhone riyaaz bhatkal or tahseen akhtar ke bich instent miseging website nimbaz ke jariye hui kai chat (chats - baatcheet) pakadi hai
 It is said that since the arrest of Indian Mujahideen leader Yasin Bhatkal from Bihar in August, Tehsin Akhtar has been running the terrorist organization
 jaanchakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki riyaaz bhatkal hi aatankwaadi hamalon ke liye sidhe aadesh detaa rahaa he
 After the arrest, Yasin Bhatkal had also allegedly told the interrogators that he had no knowledge of the Bodh Gaya blasts and now several modules of IM work on several instructions simultaneously
 darasal, yaccin or riyaaz karnataka ke ek hi gaanv se taalluk rakhte hai, jahaan se mana jaataa he ki donon ne aatankwaad main apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Now investigators say that the terrorists dared to carry out the blast before Narendra Modi's rally on October 27 at Patna's Gandhi Maidan, because the investigative agencies could not reach any concrete result in the Bodh Gaya blasts case or make any arrest
 vaise, is hafte kii shuruyaat main neshnal investigeshan agency (enie) ne patna dhamaakon ke mukhya sandigdh haidar ali kii talash main ranchi ke ek chote-se hotel main chapa maaraa tha
 Hyder Ali had escaped by then, but the NIA also got a chart from 27 live bombs from there, which listed the names of those who had allegedly planted a total of 13 bombs in Bodh Gaya in July
 donon hamalon main kaaphi samanthaayen hai, or jaanchakartaaon ke anusaar donon hi hamale indian mujahidin kii nai gathit ranchi shakha ne kiye
 Six people were sent to both the places, and in both places they divided into teams of two and planted three bombs
 jaanchakartaaon ke mutabik donon hi jagahon par bam lagane waalon main imtiyaaz ansaari shaamil tha, jise patna railway stesan se bhaagane kii koshish karte hue giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 It is written secretly on government files, which means this information will not be public
 usee tarah hamaari aapaki zindagi kii kuch aisi suchanaaen hoti hai jinke bare main ham nahin chaahate ki duniya jane
 Would you like someone else to read the letter written in your name and also know where the letter came from
 aap chitthee seene se lagaakar padhate hai yaa sari duniya ko dikhaa kar padhate hai
 i am giving this example so that it becomes clear to everyone that the reading of the letter in front of everyone is a violation of privacy
 jaise agar main aapkaa passbook lekar dekhne lag jaaun ki kitna paisa he to aapako bura lagegaa
 Just as the privacy of the government is its privacy, it is privacy, in the same way your privacy is also privacy
 aaj kal aadhaar kai chizon main anivaary kiya jane laga he
 Aadhaar card contains many of your information
 in sab jaankariyon ko aajkal data kehete hai
 In any country of the world, this data is not secure, but ultimately not secure
 ek jagah jamaa hone ke kaaran inke uda lene kaa khatara bana rahata he
 Has also been blown
 supreme court main aadhaar ko biometric yani ankhon kii putali, ungaliyon ke nishaan se jode jane ke kilaaf 20 yachikaayen daayar hai
 67 years after the Constitution came into force on 26 January 1950, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court of India is considering whether privacy, privacy is your fundamental right
 9 jajon kii bench ke saamne yah sawaal aadhaar ke sandarbh main aayaa he
 In many things, the petition has challenged the question of making Aadhaar compulsory, that after Aadhaar no one will be veiled by anyone
 niztaa samaapt ho jaaegi
 This is a violation of the fundamental premise
 isiilie vichaar ho rahaa he ki kya niztaa moulik adhikaar he
 If all the information of Aadhaar, mobile number associated with it, bank accounts information gets leaked, then under which law you will go to the court that your right to privacy has been violated
 jab hamase vyaktigat or saarvajanik aacharnon main ummid kii jaati he ki ek duusare kii privesi kaa khyaal rakhen, sammaan karen to vah samvidhan yaa kanoon ke tahat paribhaashit kyon nahin he
 The question which is part of the social code, why is the question not part of the constitution
 yah sawaal pehle bhi tha magar digital daur main kaaphi bada ho gaya he
 You can be chased like a criminal continuously in this world
 ek teesri aankh dekh rahi hoti he
 The privacy of millions of people is attacked everyday around the world
 logon ke bare main jaankaree jamaa karnaa or use chura kar bechnaa, yah apane aap main ek dhandha he
 That's why when you start selling or buying messages on your mobile, then you get upset
 iske liye telephone regulatory of india ne ek vyavastha kii he jiske tahat aap darj kara sakate hai ki aapako is tarah ke messej nahin bheje jaaen
 You do this because you do not want someone to interfere in your privacy
 koi jane ki aapane freez karidaa he, ab uskaa cover bhi kareed lijie
 Therefore, a bench of 9 judges in the Supreme Court is churning on 19 and 20 July whether the right to privacy is a fundamental right or not
 empi sharma ke cese main aath jajon kii peeth or1962 main kharag singh ke cese main chah jajon kii peeth ne faisla diya tha ki niztaa kaa adhikaar moulik adhikaar nahin he
 Even after this, many decisions have come in which the court has considered the right to privacy as a fundamental right
 buudhvaar ko gopal subramanyam or shyaam dewan ne niztaa ko moulik adhikaar ke liye bahes kii
 Aadhaar is being linked from bank to mobile number
 anivaary kiya ja rahaa he
 We are all getting Aadhaar cards also made, but are we able to understand the question of what can happen to you if Aadhaar's data was leaked, and everyone gets to know
 gopal subramanyam ne kaha ki samvidhan kii prastaavna main logon ko sochane kii azaadi kaa adhikaar detii he
 This is not possible without freedom and privacy
 vichaaron kii swatantraaa tabhi hogi jab aapaki privesi surakshit rahe or azaadi ho
 Privacy is the basic and essential element of Liberty
 kisi duusare adhikaar kii chaaya main rahane vaala nahin he
 The rights of Liberty and Privacy are not given to us, rather they already exist
 ye swaabhaavik adhikaar hai
 Gopal Subramaniam said that we do not say that the scope of the right to live under Article 21 should be increased but the rights which already exist should be recognized, recognized
 purv solicytor general soli psorabji ne kaha he ki samvidhan main rhite tu privesi nahin likhaa he, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki ye he hi nahin
 Privacy is an integral part of every human personality
 jaise samvidhan artical 19 ke tahat press kii azaadi kaa adhikaar nahin detaa, use abhivyakti kii azaadi kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 The courts have also always considered this
 shyaam dewan ne apni daleel main kaha ki rajya sabha main 16 march 2016 ko arun jetali ne kaha tha ki ab ye kehane main ki privesi moulik adhikaar he yaa nahin, kaaphi der ho chuki he
 Privacy is probably a fundamental right
 rhite tu privesi, samvidhan ke artical 14, samanta ke adhikaar, artical 19 abhivyakti kii azaadi or artikil 21 jeene ke adhikaar ke sunahare trikon se mila he
 The interview of Nandan Nilekani, the biggest proponent of Aadhaar, was featured in the Business Standard on 19 July 2017
 isamen nilekani ne jo kaha he vahi ashankaayen aadhaar or privesi ko lekar log vyakt karte aa rahe hai
 He has said that having data on only a few digital platforms will give rise to digital monopoly
 china main local companiyon ko tavajjo di gai lekin bharat main bahari companiyaan hai jo internet kii duniya main chai hui hai
 Like Facebook and Google
 ye companiyaan bhi data ke badale free sarvice detii hai
 If they have data, advertising is more
 bharat main aisi koi niti nahin he jahaan pataa ho ki koun sa data share karnaa he, koun sa nijee he
 i am worried that this data will now create monopoly and a new colonization model
 agar aadhaar ke janak nilekani ji yah baat kah rahe hai ki data jutakar companiyaan nayaa upnivesh bana sakati hai
 Colonization means enslaving people there like Britain has made India its colony
 agar ye khatara he ki internet companiyon ke liye bhi or aadhaar ke liye bhi yah saaf hona chahie ki privesi niztaa ke hamaare adhikaar kya hai
 If already, do we know if a company violates it, how can a citizen claim the government if Aadhaar data gets leaked from the government's data bank
 internet company ke khilaaf kis kanoon ke tahat wo apana insaaf maang saktaa he
 The comments 19 july ke bijness standard main nandan nilekani kaa bayaan chapa he jisamen unhone kaha he ki privesi ko lekar nayaa kanoon bananaa chahie taaki upabhokta jise yuzar kehete hai, uskaa niyantran ho apni jaankaree par
 Do we know if there are foreign companies in the Digital India government campaign or not, if they have any kind of control over our data
 kya nilekani google or fasebuk se aagaah kar rahe hai
 Facebook and Google have their own version in China
 vahaan ke logon kaa data america main baithi company ke paas he
 Nilekani has said that we do not have any law to curb this
 agar nilekani ko lagata he ki privesi ke liye nayaa kanoon hona chahie to iskaa matlab he ki aadhaar ko lekar privesi, niztaa ke adhikaar kaa sawaal uthaane vaale bhi sahi jagah par lagate hai
 Therefore it becomes necessary to define privacy
 uski sanvaidhaniktaa saaf saaf ho
 67 years after the Constitution came into force on 26 January 1950, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court of India is considering whether privacy, privacy is your fundamental right
 9 jajon kii bench ke saamne yah sawaal aadhaar ke sandarbh main aayaa he
 In many things, the petition has challenged the question of making Aadhaar compulsory, that after Aadhaar no one will be veiled by anyone
 niztaa samaapt ho jaaegi
 This is a violation of the fundamental premise
 isiilie vichaar ho rahaa he ki kya niztaa moulik adhikaar he
 If all the information of Aadhaar, mobile number associated with it, bank accounts information gets leaked, then under which law you will go to the court that your right to privacy has been violated
 jab hamase vyaktigat or saarvajanik aacharnon main ummid kii jaati he ki ek duusare kii privesi kaa khyaal rakhen, sammaan karen to vah samvidhan yaa kanoon ke tahat paribhaashit kyon nahin he
 The question which is part of the social code, why is the question not part of the constitution
 yah sawaal pehle bhi tha magar digital daur main kaaphi bada ho gaya he
 You can be chased like a criminal continuously in this world
 ek teesri aankh dekh rahi hoti he
 The privacy of millions of people is attacked everyday around the world
 logon ke bare main jaankaree jamaa karnaa or use chura kar bechnaa, yah apane aap main ek dhandha he
 That's why when you start selling or buying messages on your mobile, then you get upset
 iske liye telephone regulatory of india ne ek vyavastha kii he jiske tahat aap darj kara sakate hai ki aapako is tarah ke messej nahin bheje jaaen
 You do this because you do not want someone to interfere in your privacy
 koi jane ki aapane freez karidaa he, ab uskaa cover bhi kareed lijie
 Therefore, a bench of 9 judges in the Supreme Court is churning on 19 and 20 July whether the right to privacy is a fundamental right or not
 empi sharma ke cese main aath jajon kii peeth or1962 main kharag singh ke cese main chah jajon kii peeth ne faisla diya tha ki niztaa kaa adhikaar moulik adhikaar nahin he
 Even after this, many decisions have come in which the court has considered the right to privacy as a fundamental right
 buudhvaar ko gopal subramanyam or shyaam dewan ne niztaa ko moulik adhikaar ke liye bahes kii
 Aadhaar is being linked from bank to mobile number
 anivaary kiya ja rahaa he
 We are all getting Aadhaar cards also made, but are we able to understand the question of what can happen to you if Aadhaar's data was leaked, and everyone gets to know
 gopal subramanyam ne kaha ki samvidhan kii prastaavna main logon ko sochane kii azaadi kaa adhikaar detii he
 This is not possible without freedom and privacy
 vichaaron kii swatantraaa tabhi hogi jab aapaki privesi surakshit rahe or azaadi ho
 Privacy is the basic and essential element of Liberty
 kisi duusare adhikaar kii chaaya main rahane vaala nahin he
 The rights of Liberty and Privacy are not given to us, rather they already exist
 ye swaabhaavik adhikaar hai
 Gopal Subramaniam said that we do not say that the scope of the right to live under Article 21 should be increased but the rights which already exist should be recognized, recognized
 purv solicytor general soli psorabji ne kaha he ki samvidhan main rhite tu privesi nahin likhaa he, iskaa matlab yah nahin ki ye he hi nahin
 Privacy is an integral part of every human personality
 jaise samvidhan artical 19 ke tahat press kii azaadi kaa adhikaar nahin detaa, use abhivyakti kii azaadi kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 The courts have also always considered this
 shyaam dewan ne apni daleel main kaha ki rajya sabha main 16 march 2016 ko arun jetali ne kaha tha ki ab ye kehane main ki privesi moulik adhikaar he yaa nahin, kaaphi der ho chuki he
 Privacy is probably a fundamental right
 rhite tu privesi, samvidhan ke artical 14, samanta ke adhikaar, artical 19 abhivyakti kii azaadi or artikil 21 jeene ke adhikaar ke sunahare trikon se mila he
 The interview of Nandan Nilekani, the biggest proponent of Aadhaar, was featured in the Business Standard on 19 July 2017
 isamen nilekani ne jo kaha he vahi ashankaayen aadhaar or privesi ko lekar log vyakt karte aa rahe hai
 He has said that having data on only a few digital platforms will give rise to digital monopoly
 china main local companiyon ko tavajjo di gai lekin bharat main bahari companiyaan hai jo internet kii duniya main chai hui hai
 Like Facebook and Google
 ye companiyaan bhi data ke badale free sarvice detii hai
 If they have data, advertising is more
 bharat main aisi koi niti nahin he jahaan pataa ho ki koun sa data share karnaa he, koun sa nijee he
 i am worried that this data will now create monopoly and a new colonization model
 agar aadhaar ke janak nilekani ji yah baat kah rahe hai ki data jutakar companiyaan nayaa upnivesh bana sakati hai
 Colonization means enslaving people there like Britain has made India its colony
 agar ye khatara he ki internet companiyon ke liye bhi or aadhaar ke liye bhi yah saaf hona chahie ki privesi niztaa ke hamaare adhikaar kya hai
 If already, do we know if a company violates it, how can a citizen claim the government if Aadhaar data gets leaked from the government's data bank
 internet company ke khilaaf kis kanoon ke tahat wo apana insaaf maang saktaa he
 The comments 19 july ke bijness standard main nandan nilekani kaa bayaan chapa he jisamen unhone kaha he ki privesi ko lekar nayaa kanoon bananaa chahie taaki upabhokta jise yuzar kehete hai, uskaa niyantran ho apni jaankaree par
 Do we know if there are foreign companies in the Digital India government campaign or not, if they have any kind of control over our data
 kya nilekani google or fasebuk se aagaah kar rahe hai
 Facebook and Google have their own version in China
 vahaan ke logon kaa data america main baithi company ke paas he
 Nilekani has said that we do not have any law to curb this
 agar nilekani ko lagata he ki privesi ke liye nayaa kanoon hona chahie to iskaa matlab he ki aadhaar ko lekar privesi, niztaa ke adhikaar kaa sawaal uthaane vaale bhi sahi jagah par lagate hai
 Therefore it becomes necessary to define privacy
 uski sanvaidhaniktaa saaf saaf ho
 This question was there earlier also but it has become very big in the digital era
 aap is jagat main lagaataar kisi apradhi kii tarah peechha kiye ja sakate hai
 a third eye is watching
 duniyabar main rose lakhon logon kii privesi par hamalaa hota he
 Collecting and selling information about people is a business in itself
 tabhi to aapke mobile par jab cell yaa kharido becho ke messej aane lagate hai to aap pareshaan ho jate hai
 For this, the telephone Regulatory of India has made an arrangement under which you can register that such messages are not sent to you
 yah aap isliye karte hai kyonki aap nahin chaahate ki koi aapaki niztaa main dakhal de
 Know that you have bought the freeze, now buy its cover too
 isliye supreme court main 9 jajon kii peeth 19 or 20 july ko manthan kar rahi he ki niztaa kaa adhikaar moulik adhikaar he yaa nahin
 a bench of eight judges in MP Sharma's case and a six-judge bench in Kharak Singh's case in 1962 ruled that the right to privacy was not a fundamental right
 iske baad bhi kai faisle aae hai jinamein adaalat ne niztaa ke adhikaar ko moulik adhikaar mana he
 On Wednesday, Gopal Subramaniam and Shyam Dewan argued for fundamental right to privacy
 bank se lekar mobile number tak aadhaar se joda ja rahaa he
 Is being made mandatory
 ham sab aadhaar card banavaa bhi rahe hai lekin kya ham is sawaal ko samaj paa rahe hai ki agar aadhaar kaa data li ho gaya, or sabko pataa chal gaya to aapke saath kya ho saktaa he
 Gopal Subramaniam said that the Preamble to the Constitution gives people the right to freedom of thought
 bagair azaadi or niztaa ke yah sambhav nahin he
 Freedom of thought will happen only when your privacy is protected and there is freedom
 privesi liberty kaa mul or anivaary tatv he
 One is not going to live in the shadow of any other authority
 liberty or privesi ke adhikaar hamen die nahin gaye hai balki ye pehle se maujuud hai
 These are natural rights
 gopal subramanyam ne kaha ki ham ye nahin kehete ki artical 21 ke tahat jeene ke adhikaar kaa dayera badhaayaa jaae balki jo adhikaar pehle se hai, unki pahchaan kii jaae, manyata di jaae
 Former Solicitor Jan Ral Soli Sorabjee has said that the Right to Privacy is not written in the Constitution, it does not mean that it does not exist
 privesi har maanav vyaktitv kaa abhinn ang he
 Just as the Constitution does not give freedom of press under Article 19, it is seen as freedom of expression
 adaalaton ne bhi is baat ko hameshaa mana he
 Shyam Dewan said in his plea that on 16 March 2016 in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley had said that it is too late to say whether privacy is a fundamental right or not
 privesi shaayad ek moulik adhikaar he
 Right to privacy, article 14 of the constitution, right to equality, article 19 is a golden triangle of freedom of expression and right to live article 21
 aadhaar ke sabase bade samarthak nandan nilekani kaa intervyuu 19 july 2017 ke bijness standard main chapa he
 In this, what Nilekani has said, people have been expressing the same apprehensions about Aadhaar and privacy
 unhone kaha he ki sirf kuch digital platform ke paas data hona digital monopoli ko janm degaa
 Local companies were preferred in China but there are external companies in India which dominate the Internet world
 jaise fasebuk or google
 These companies also provide free service in lieu of data
 inke paas data he to vigyaapan bhi zyaada he
 There is no such policy in India where you know which data to share, which is private
 mujhe chintaa he ki ye data ab monopoli bana degaa or nayaa colonization model banegaa
 If the father of Aadhaar, Nilekani ji is saying that by gathering data, companies can create a new colony
 upnivesh matlab vahaan ke logon ko ghulaam bana lenaa jaise britain ne bharat ko apana upnivesh bana liya he
 If there is a danger that it should be clear for Internet companies as well as for Aadhaar what our rights of privacy are
 agar pehle se hai to kya hamen maaloom he ki iskaa koi company ulanghan karti he, agar sarkaar ke data bank se aadhaar kaa data li ho jaataa he to ek naagarik sarkaar par kis tarah se daawey kar saktaa he
 Under which law against internet company can he ask for his justice
 tippaniyan Nandan Nilekani's statement has been published in the Business Standard of 19 July in which he has said that a new law should be made about privacy so that the consumer, who is called a user, has control over his information
 kya ham jaanate hai ki digital india ke sarkari abhiyaan main videshi companiyaan hai yaa nahin agar hai to unka hamaare data par kis tarah kaa niyantran hoga
 Are Nilekani warning against Google and Facebook? china main fasebuk or google kaa apana sanskaran he
 The data of the people there is with the company sitting in America
 nilekani ne kaha he ki hamaare paas is par lagaam lagane ke liye koi kanoon nahin he
 If Nilekani feels that there should be a new law for privacy, it means that those who question the right to privacy and privacy regarding Aadhaar also seem to be in the right place
 isliye yah zaruri ho jaataa he ki niztaa ko paribhaashit kiya jaae
 His constitutionality should be clear
 isliye supreme court main 9 jajon kii peeth 19 or 20 july ko manthan kar rahi he ki niztaa kaa adhikaar moulik adhikaar he yaa nahin

 sidney cricket ground par itnaa bada score sirf ek hi baar hasil kiya gaya tha isliye dabaav team india par tha
 Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma had the responsibility to ease this pressure and both started in favor of Team India
 shikhar-rohit kii dhamaakedaar shuruatatim india ke opebers kuch sochakar maidan main aae the
 It was important to stay on the wicket and to score fast runs
 shuruuaat hui bhi kuch aisi hi
 Both batted well for the first three overs
 pari ke chauthe over main hezalwood kii gend par wicketiper bread hadine ne shikhar dhawan kaa kaich chhod diya
 Shikhar was playing at 5 at the time
 team india ke liye ye ek bada jeevandaan tha jiskaa phayda shikhar dhawan ne khub uthaaya
 Shikhar and Rohit batted at an average of around 6
 shikhar dhawan ne 10wein over main do chauke or ek chakka jadkar team india ke 50 ran puure kiye
 After this the run rate increased further, by the 13th over India had scored 76 runs but Shikhar Dhawan made a mistake on this score
 match main lautaa australiahezalwood ke 13wein over kii paanchavin gend ko shikhar dhawan ne extra cover ke upar se drive karne kii koshish kii lekin deep extra cover par maxwell ko shaayad isi shot ke liye khadaa kiya gaya tha
 After making 45 runs off 41 balls, this mistake of Shikhar was overshadowed by Team India
 2 ran baad hi viraat kohli ko mishael johnson ne vidaa kar diya
 Trying to pull Johnson's bouncer, Virat took the upper edge of the bat and went to wicketkeeper Hedin and Virat's innings came to an end
 itane bade match main viraat jaise ballebaaz se 13 gendon par 1 ran banane kii ummid kisi ne nahin kii thi
 Rohit Sharma also became the victim of this great spell of Johnson
 34 ran par jamkar khel rahe rohit ke balle kaa andruni kinaaraa lekar johnson kii gend unki gilliyaan le udin
 After this Suresh Raina also came and scored just 7 runs, caught by wicketkeeper Hedin off James Faulkner
 108 par 4 wicket ganvaakar team india gambhir sankat main funs chuki thi
 The huge responsibility that came over dhoni-rahane, the captain now had a huge responsibility and Ajinkya Rahane had a huge chance
 ran rate kaa dabaav aasmaan chhu rahaa tha or tej ran bananaa badi chunauti thi
 In this case, both of them have about 5
 30 kii ausat se ran banane shuru kiye
 13
 2 over main donon ne 70 ran kii saajhedaari kar daali
 During this time India also crossed the 150-run mark
 37wein over main 44 ran banane ke baad rahane michel stark kii ek gend par beet hue lekin wicketiper bread hedin ne kaich kii apil kii or maaikel clark ne rivyuu le liya
 The TV replays did not reveal anything specific but the snikometer was telling that the ball went to the wicketkeeper with the outer edge of Rahane's bat
 third ampire ne rahane ko out qaraar diya
 This was the fifth blow to India at 178
 dhoni kii koshish naakamajadeja bhi 42wein over main 17 gendon par 18 ran banaakar ran out ho gaye
 Captain Dhoni held one end in trouble
 40 over ke baad team india ko kareeb 12 ke ausat se ran banane the
 India's 200 runs were completed in the 41st over
 dhoni bich-bich main bade shot bhi lagaate lekin ye sab bharat ke liye naakaafi sabit ho rahaa tha
 Dhoni also completed his half-century with the help of 3 fours and 1 six off 55 balls
 aakhirkaar dhoni kaa sangharsh 45wein over main jaakar khatm hua
 Dhoni Maxwell was runout on a brilliant throw after scoring 65 runs off 93 balls
 stark kii gend ko unhone midwicket par khelaa or single lene ke liye daud pade lekin unase pehle gend wicket tak ja pahunchi
 India did not survive after the departure of Tajdhoni, the defeat of Team India was just a formality
 dhoni kaa wicket 231 ke score par gira tha or agle 2 ranon main baaki teen ballebaaz bhi out ho gaye
 If Ashwin scored 5 runs, Mohit Sharma and Umesh Yadav could not open the account
 mohammad shami 1 ran banaakar naabad rahe
 Australian bowlers wreaked havoc on India
 foconor ne 3 wicket liye to johnson or stark ne 2-2, hezalwood ko ek wicket mila
 With the defeat of 95 runs, India also lost the chance to play in the final and also crowned the world winner
