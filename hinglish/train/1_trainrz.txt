 Barely three months after coming to power on February 19, 2013, Virbhadra Singh presided over a cabinet meeting that had an interesting yet controversial topic of cancellation of the 99-year lease on its agenda

 is par use ek ayurvedic aspataal, ek anusandhan centre or jadi-bootiyon kaa ek bagichaa or sangrah centre bananaa tha
 At that time the police and revenue officers of the state had also taken possession of the land, showing great agility
 virbhadra ne baad main daawa kiya tha ki ''aniyamittaaon or gadbaditon" kii vajah se lij radd kii gai or kabja waapas liya gaya
 However, at that time he did not say what these irregularities were
 ab pichley hafte 14 farvari ko unhone kaha, ''hamane nae sire se maamle kii jaanch kii or is nattejey par pahunche ki koi ulanghan nahin hua he
 "he also refuted the earlier allegations that Ramdev who wanted to get the construction done came under encroachment
 unhone kaha, ''yoga guru ne jis jameen par nivesh karne kii peshkash kii he, vah banjar jameen he
 If there is some investment in the state, which benefits the state and the people, then what is the harm in this? ”interestingly, the Chief Minister also reminded the people how much respect they have towards the Yoga Guru and Ramdev's yoga camp was not only organized but also participated in "hamirpur" at "personal expenses"
 " virbhadra ne ab daawa kiya he ki unhen ''is maamle ke asal tathyon kii jaankaree" nahin di gai thi
 Significantly, after the state government withdrew possession of the land, in 2013, the Himachal Pradesh High Court ordered the Patanjali to maintain the status quo on the land

 ) Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Nitin Gadkari has once again come into controversy over his statement
 is baar unka bayaan swami vivekanand ke sandarbh main aayaa he
 Gadkari compared Vivekananda's IQ (intelligence Quotations) to the intellectual level of Mafia don Dawood Ibrahim
 haalanki gadakari ne is par bavaal machane ke baad kaha ki unke bayaan ko galat sandarbhon main pesh kiya gaya
 In his statement at an award ceremony in Bhopal on Sunday evening, Gadkari said, "in psychology we measure the IQ level of people
 
 But it depends on the person in which field he uses his intelligence
 " "if we compare Swami Vivekananda's IQ level with the IQ level of both, we look similar," Gadkari said at the Ojaswini Investiture Ceremony organized at the Rabindra Bhavan to honor leading women from various fields
 lekin donon kii jivan disha bilkul vipareet he
 While Vivekananda used it for nation building, brotherhood and spirituality, Dawood used it for destructive purposes
 " There was a sharp reaction to this statement in political circles
 congress ne is bayaan ke liye gadakari se maafee maangane kii maang kii
 When reporters surrounded Gadkari, he said, "I did not make any comparison between Swami Vivekananda and Dawood Ibrahim
 
 i said that if a person uses his intellect properly, he can become Vivekananda or Dawood Ibrahim
 " gadakari ne kaha, "mere bayaan ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya
 " congress ne kaha ki gadakari kii tippanee unki party kii soch ke str or maansikta ko jaahir karti he
 With this, the Congress demanded an apology from him
 kendriya soochna evam prasaaran mantri manish tiwari ne kaha ki gadakari kii tippanee unki bhaajapa kii samskruti or maansikta kaa ek or spashtikaran he
 Tiwari said that cleanliness alone is not enough, and the BJP should apologize to the people of this country, especially to the wise and the leaders of the country
 congress ke rashtriya mahasachiv digvijay singh ne gadakari ke bayaan kii ninda karte hue kaha ki gadakari rashtriya swayan sevak sangh ke numaayinde hai or ve vahi bhashaa bolte hai, jo sangh kii hoti he
 Talking to reporters in Guna, Singh said that he has sought answers from Gadkari on Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, senior BJP leader LK Advani and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh ajay singh ne kaha ki gadakari kaa bayaan bhaajapa ke asli chehre ko ujagar karne vaala he
 Gadkari's black conduct of corruption has been exposed, which has affected his mental balance
 gadakari ke bayaan ke khilaaf congressi sadakon par bhi utar aae
 He demanded a public apology by burning an effigy of Gadkari
 yuvak congress va congress kaaryakartaaon ne somvaar ko board offis chauraahey par gadakari ke putale kaa dahan kiya
 Also, a public apology has been demanded from Gadkari
 yuvak congress ne chetavanee di he ki agar gadakari ne maafee nahin maangi to pradeshvyapee andolan kiya jayega
 On the other hand, BJP leaders were busy clarifying on Gadkari's statement
 bhaajapa netaa balbir punj ne somvaar ko isse inkaar kiya ki gadakari ne vivekanand kii tulana daaud se kii he
 He said, "he did not compare Vivekananda to Dawood, he only explained the contradiction between the two
" " Punj said that Gadkari was just saying that any kind of power, money or intelligence can be used for good or bad works
 is bich, madhya pradesh ke udyog mantri kailash vijayawargeey gadakari ke bachaav main khulkar saamne aae
 The comments vijayawargeey ne kaha he ki vivekanand va daud ko lekar die gaye bayaan ko galat tareeke se liya ja rahaa hai
 Gadkari's statement should be taken positively, he had taken Dawood's name only while explaining the use of intelligence
 bayaan kaa samarthan karte hue vijayawargeey ne kaha ki jab bhi ram kii charchaa hoti he to ravan kaa zikr aata hi he, thik isi tarah krishna ke saath kansa kii charchaa hoti he
 This does not mean that we are standing equal to both
 bhopal main ravivaar shaam ek puraskaar samaaroh main apane vaktavy main gadakari ne kaha tha, "manovigyaan main ham logon kaa aikyuu str maapte hai
 
 lekin yah vyakti-vyakti par nirbhar karata he ki vah apni buddhi kaa istemaal kis kshetra main karata he
 " gadakari ne rabindra bhawan main vibhinn kshetron kii agrani mahilaon ke sammaan ke liye yojit ojaswini alankaran samaaroh main kaha, "yadi ham swami vivekanand ke aikyuu str kii tulana daaud ibrahim ke aikyuu str se karen to donon kaa aikyuu str samaan dikhataa he
 But the life direction of both is completely opposite
 vivekanand ne iskaa upyog jahaan raashtra nirmaan, bhaichaargi or aadhyatm ke liye kiya, vahiin daaud ne iskaa upyog vinaashkari uddeshyon ke liye
 " is bayaan par raajnneetik halake main tikhi pratikriya hui
 The Congress demanded an apology from Gadkari for this statement
 jab samvaadadaataaon ne gadakari ko gheraa to unhone kaha, "maine swami vivekanand or daaud ibrahim ke bich koi tulana nahin kii
 
 maine kaha tha ki yadi koi vyakti apni buddhi kaa sahi istemaal kare to vah vivekanand yaa phir daaud ibrahim ban saktaa he
 "gadkari said," misrepresented my statement
 " The Congress said that Gadkari's remarks reflected his party's level of thinking and mindset
 iske saath hi congress ne maafee maangane kii unase maang kii
 Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari said that Gadkari's remarks are another explanation of his bjp's culture and mentality
 tiwari ne kaha ki keval safai hi kaaphi nahin he or bhaajapa ko is desh kii janata se maafee maangani chahie, khaastaur se soch-samaj rakhane waalon se or desh ke netaaon se
 Congress National Secretary Digvijay Singh condemned Gadkari's statement that Gadkari is the representative of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and he speaks the same language as the Sangh
 guna main singh ne samvaadadaataaon se charchaa karte hue kaha ki gadakari ke bayaan par sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat, bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani va gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi se jawaab maanga he
 Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Ajay Singh said that Gadkari's statement is going to reveal the real face of the BJP
 gadakari ke bhrashtachar ke kaale aacharan ujagar hue hai jisase unke maansik santulan par bura asar padaa he
 Congressmen also took to the streets against Gadkari's statement
 unhone gadakari kaa putala dahan kar saarvajanik maafee maangane kii maang kii
 Youth Congress and Congress workers on Monday burnt effigies of Gadkari at the board office intersection
 saath hi gadakari se saarvajanik maafee maange jane kii maang kii gai he
 The Youth Congress has warned that if Gadkari does not apologize, there will be a statewide agitation
 udhar, bhaajapa netaa gadakari ke bayaan par safai dene main jute rahe
 BJP leader Balbir Punj on Monday denied that Gadkari compared Vivekananda to Dawood
 unhone kaha, "unhone vivekanand kii tulana daaud se nahin kii, unhone sirf donon ke bich ke virodhabhas ko spasht kiya
 " punj ne kaha ki gadakari sirf yah kah rahe the ki kisi bhi tarah kii satta, dhan yaa buddhi ko achche yaa bure kaamon main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Industries Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya came out openly in defense of Gadkari
 tippaniyan Vijayvargiya has said that the statements given about Vivekananda and Dawood are being taken incorrectly
 gadakari ke bayaan ko sakaaratmak rup se liya janaa chahie, unhone to budghimatta ke istemaal kii vyakhya karte hue hi daaud kaa naam liya tha
 Supporting the statement, Vijayvargiya said that whenever Rama is discussed, Ravana is mentioned, in the same way Kansa is discussed with Krishna
 iskaa arth yah nahin he ki donon ko ham baraabar khadey kar rahe hai
 "if we compare Swami Vivekananda's IQ level with the IQ level of both, we look similar," Gadkari said at the Ojaswini Investiture Ceremony organized at the Rabindra Bhavan to honor leading women from various fields

 With this, Maxwell topped the list of batsmen with the most runs and most sixes in IPL-7

 pujaara ek chor sambhalakar khadey jarur the par ran gati tej karne main asamarth najar aa rahe the
 But Miller, who came to bat after Maxwell's departure, added 27 runs in the 18th over with four sixes and significantly reduced the gap between the run and the ball

 Ajinkya Rahane (13), who was the hero of the previous match for the Royals, however could not do anything special in this match and was run out in the last over of the third over

 Former BJP minister Shahnawaz Hussain was also eyeing for this ticket, but the Bihar ticket has been stamped in the name of Sushil Modi on a single ticket
 is maamle main antim faisla dilli main kendriya cameti karegi
 Sushil Kumar Modi, who is a member of the Legislative Council, till date, no name has been revealed by the party for the two seats of the Bihar Legislative Council

 atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar main vah sabase kam umr ke kendriya mantri bhi bane, lekin 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main vah kishanganj se haar gaye the
 After that, when Sushil Kumar Modi became the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, his vacant Bhagalpur seat was contested and won by Hussain
 uske baad 2009 main bhi bhagalpur se saansad bane
 If BJP won in Bihar, Shahnawaz's Rajya Sabha was certain that in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Shahnawaz lost the election despite Modi wave
 tab se vah lagaataar ucch sadan pahunchane kii koshish main lage the
 If the BJP had a good performance in the assembly, they would have got a chance
 tab susheel modi ko bhi rajyasabha jane kii naubat nahin aati
 This could not happen, and once again Shahnawaz Hussain felt disillusioned

 In the political corridors, speculation was rife that Sapna Chaudhary would join the Congress and contest against Hemamalini from the Mathura seat
 lekin congress ne mathura se mahesh pathak ko ummidavaar banaakar in atakalon ko khaarij kar diya tha
 After this, it was believed that Congress could field them from any other seat

 pakistan ne somvaar ko bharat se 2007 main samjhauta train visphot maamle main hui jaanch ke bare main yashasheeghra jaankaree muhaiyaa karaae jane ko kaha he
 Significantly, in this explosion, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader Swami Aseemanand has confessed to being the Sangh's hand
 videsh mantralay main mahanideshak :dakshin asia: afrsiyab mehadi hashmi ne paak sthit bharat ke kaaryakari up ucchayukta ji ve shrinivas se yah jaankaree muhaiyaa karaane ko kaha he
 He told Srinivas that information about progress in investigation should be provided as soon as possible
 nai dilli sthit ek adaalat main swami aseemanand ke ikbaalia bayaan kaa jahiraa taur par hawala dete hue videsh mantralay dwaara jari ek bayaan main kaha gaya, bhartiya rajanyik kaa dhyaan farvari 2007 ke samjhauta express visphot maamle kii jaanch ko lekar media main aayi khabaron kii ore dilaayaa gaya
 The Foreign Ministry statement said, they were reiterated that the Government of Pakistan is waiting for the progress made by the Government of India to investigate the Samjhauta Express blast case
 isamen kaha gaya he, shri shrinivas ko yah bhi rekhaankit kiya gaya ki bharat sarkaar kii ore se yah pratikriya yathashighra di jaani chahie
 Aseemanand (59) recently admitted to the Sangh's involvement in several terrorist attacks, including the Samjhauta Express
 is visphot main 42 pakistaniyon sahit 68 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Sources in the Government of Pakistan said that the Ministry of External Affairs hopes that India will provide information about the investigation of the Samjhauta Express blast ahead of the talks between the Foreign Secretaries of the two countries to be held in Bhutan on February 6-7

 Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit had said, it took the Samjhauta Express blast case four years to reach this turn
 ham sirf is baat kii ummid hi kar sakate hai ki aparaadhiyon ko nyaay ke katghare main khadaa karne main ab or samay nahin lagaaya jayega
 Pakistan has asked India several times during the last two years to be aware of the progress made in the investigation

 On the one hand ISIS is on the verge of ruin, on the other hand ISIS enemy number one ie America in the new sky of expectations in the face of the new president

 But this prediction is that of a woman whose 85 things have been proved correct in a hundred
 bas isi vajah se ab america main trump kii jeet ke baad iesas khush ho gaya he
 Yes, a prophecy of Marhoom prophet Baba Wanga, which surprised everyone with one accurate prediction, has now left the whole world restless
 vaise to baba wanga ko ye bhavishyavaanee kiye hue bhi ab saalon guzar chuke hai, lekin chunki is bhavishyavaanee ke sach yaa jhooth sabit hone kaa vaqt ab behad kareeb he, isliye log sahame hue hai
 The waves of fear are shaking in them
 bhavishyavaktaa baba wanga ne kaha tha do steel ke parinde america main tabaahi machaa denge, iske baad twin tower par hawaii jahaaz se hamalaa ho gaya
 He said that a storm in the sea will devastate everything, followed by a terrible tsunami in Japan
 phir usne kaha ek ashwet hi aakiri america raashtrapati hoga
 After this, Barack Obama was elected President of America
 ab baba wanga kii is bhavishyavaanee ke mutabik ab america kaa ant behad qareeb he
 Because this time white president has been made
 unki bhavishyavaanee kahati he ki ek africa mul kaa shaks hi america kaa 44waan or aakiri raashtrapati sabit hoga
 Incidentally, Barack Obama is the 44th President of America and of African descent
 jinka kaarykaal ab puraa hone vaala he
 Baba Vanga, the visually impaired elderly prophet of Bulgaria, has said goodbye to this world only in the year 1996, but his words have been proved to be true even after he left
 wanga ne kaha tha ki ek africa mul kaa shaks hi america kaa aakiri raashtrapati hoga
 Anyway, no black could become the President of America before Obama
 aise main jaise hi baraak obama america kii is sabase badi kursi par kaabiz hue
 Many people started to feel that the first part of Baba Wanga's prophecy has been proved true
 lekin chunki is bhavishyavaanee kaa doosraa hissaa behad kaufanaak or pareshaan karanevaala he, baraak obama kaa kaarykaal ke khatm hone kii ghadi qareeb aane ke saath hi log baichaiyn hone lage hai
 Many types of questions are floating in people's minds
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki kya abhi-abhi raashtrapati chune gaye donald trump apane pad kii shapath nahin le sakenge? akhir wo koun si baat hogi, jo trump ko aisa karne se rokegi? kya obama ke baad america kaa vajood hi mit jayega? agar haa, to kaise? zaahir he, ye wo sawaal hai jo kisi ko bhi baichaiyn kar sakate hai
 People who believe Baba Vanga's words and especially see their predictions already proved to be true, are now in a position to be
 baba wanga kii tulana yun hi nastredamas se nahin kii jaati he
 Baba Wanga, who left this world at the age of 85, had made about 100 big predictions, 85 of which proved to be absolutely correct
 inhen bhavishyavaaniyon main america raashtrapati se judi bhavishyavaanee to ek he hi,iesasse judi bhavishyavaanee bhi he, jo tukdon main hi sahi, sach sabit hoti dikh rahi he
 According to this prediction, Muslim war will start in the year 2010, which will spread all over the world by 2016
 2043 tak puure europe main islamic charampanthiyon kaa kabza ho jayega, jiskaa centre rome hoga

 The political stir has intensified due to an advertisement in the JDU-RJD coalition government in Bihar
 darasal, path nirmaan vibhaag ke taaja vigyaapan main sirf up mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav kii tasviir ko jagah di gai he, jabaki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa cheharaa gaayab he
 Criticizing this, BJP leader Nandkishore Yadav said that this is probably the first time for a picture of another minister in lieu of the Chief Minister in an advertisement for a government event
 bijepi ne ise jediu-argedy ke bich antarkalah bataaya he, vahiin donon sattashin dal iske bachaav main utar gaye hai
 The advertisement was released on Wednesday, in response to which Tejashwi Yadav said, 'the Supreme Court order is that only one can have a photo in the advertisement
 kisi vibhaag kaa agar koi kaarykram ho rahaa he or mukhyamantri usamen bhaag lene vaale hai to vigyaapan main mukhyamantri kii tasviir chhapati he, lekin agar mukhyamantri nahin aane vaale hote hai or vibhageeya mantri ko hi us kaarykram kaa udghaatan karnaa hota he to us mantri kii tasviir hi vigyaapan main chap sakati he
 "opposition does not have issue" Deputy CM further said, "we have advertised keeping in mind all the things, keeping in mind the rules
" vipaksh ko koi mudda nahin mil rahaa he to abhi bhi difrences dikhaane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 We are having a program on everything and there is no dilemma of any kind

 in kisson main bina bataae america se sidhe sansad pahunchnaa or chupchaap gaayab ho jane se pehle dukh jaahir karnaa ki ''loktantr mar chukaa he" shaamil he
 He was openly teasing Indira Gandhi and the RSS was very fond of him for this
 gandhi parivaar ke prati swami kii nafrat aaj bhi jari he, jiske kaaran aresas ke liye ve priy bane hue hai
 Swamy was elected to the Lok Sabha from north-east Mumbai after the Emergency ended and he was a member of the Lok Sabha from 1977 to 1984
 us samay unke liye kisi mahatvapurn pad par jane kaa yah acha avasar hona chahie tha
 But Swami had made another rising star politician Atal Bihari Vajpayee his enemy
 baad main swami ne daawa kiya ki morarji desai unhen cabinet main jagah dena chaahate the, ve shaayad unhen vitt rajyamantri bananaa chaahate the, lekin us samay ke videsh mantri vaajapeyi ne adnga laga diya
 Twenty years later, in an autobiography, which appeared in installments in a Tamil weekly magazine, Swami described Vajpayee as an extremely drunkard
 swami kaa kahana he ki vaajapeyi 1998 main jab duusari baar pradhanmantri bane to unhen vitt mantri banane kii baat se mukar gaye
 When he came to know that his coalition had got Jayalalitha's support, he turned back from his tongue
 swami ne sonia gandhi or jayalalita ko ek chaay party main saath laakar, jiske baad jayalalita ne vaajapeyi sarkaar se apana samarthan waapas le liya tha or sarkaar gir gai thi, apana badla chukaa liya
 It is the same Sonia whom Swami does not even want to see with a teary eye and it is the same Jayalalithaa against whom Swamy filed a corruption case and was arrested
 swami kaa kariyar is baat kaa saboot he ki raajnneeti main dosti or dushmani main bhed nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Swami was the Union Minister of Commerce and Law for four months in Chandra Shekhar's short-term government from 1990 to 1991 
 ayyar kehete hai ki unhone ''rajeev gandhi se achche sambandh bana liye the" or isiilie ''gandhi parivaar main ve ekmaatr vyakti hai, jinhen swami gaali nahin dete hai
 "according to Iyer, this is proof that" Swami is a very volatile person and a very sharp mind has been put into his childish personality
 "hindu raashtra ke samarthak ke rup main dhyaan khinchaswami ne pichley aadhe dashak main hindu raashtra ke ghor samarthak or bhrasht logon ke dushman ke taur par phir se logon kaa dhyaan apni taraf khinchaa he
 In 2012 because of his petition to the Supreme Court, A
 raja ko jail janaa padaa tha
 a
 raja 2ji spectrum ghotaale ke samay doorsanchaar mantri the or us ghotaale ke kaaran sarkaar ko baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 According to CAG estimates, the loss is around Rs 170,000 crore
 kaa tha
 His interest in litigation and his ability to bring Sonia and Rahul on the defensive have made him indispensable to the RSS
 sangh se unke rishte ab bhale hi achche hai, lekin 2000 main swami ne pakshik patrika fortnite main ek lekh likhaa tha, jisamen ''aresas main badhate fasiwad" kii chetavanee di gai thi
 The good news, he wrote, is that "this trick may fail
" 
 
 madar india kii shaktiyaan ise kaamyaab nahin hone dengi
 "swamy's supporters come straight to the allegations — especially those journalists whom he holds close, for example in 2G or former finance minister P
P
 chidambaram ke bete karti chidambaram ke khilaaf hawala maamle main unke saath kaam kiya tha—kehete hai ki ve ''sidhi baat karne vaale" vyakti hai or ''unka koi swaarth nahin he
 "but records show that it is not
 bijepi ke ek sutara ke mutabik, jetali ke kaaran hi swami ko 2014 main dilli se loksabhaa kaa tikat nahin mil paaya tha
 Whether this story is right or wrong, Swami may believe it
 isliye ve vitt mantri ke peeche pad gaye hai
 Apart from this, Jaitley has the ministry which Swami always wanted for himself
 jetali par sidhaa nishaanaa lagane se bachate hue swami apane twitor ke hathiyaar kaa sahaara lenaa zyada pasand karte hai
 His remarks about Indian officials that they appear to be waiters in western clothes were the masterpiece and were going to hurt and ridicule Jaitley's ego, after which Jaitley had to complain to the Prime Minister and the BJP President
 bade padon par baithe logon ko liya nishane parkoi bhi vishleshak yahi nishkarsh nikaalega ki rajan ko hataane ke liye swami ko istemaal kiya gaya tha
 Encouraged by this success, Swamy turned his gun's barrel towards Subrahmanyam
 unhone twitor par garajte hue kaha, ''unhen barkhaast karo
 "and put a total of five exclamation marks next to it
 baad main kiye gaye ek chaturaai bhare twit main unhone ''washington disi ke arvind subrahmanyam kaa zikr kiya
 Swamy's favorite pastime is to blur "indianness" of his enemy
 teen saal pehle unhone dilli hycourt main ek janhit yachika daayar karke hindu akhbaar ke tatkaaleen sampadak siddharth varadarajan ko hataane kii maang kii thi, kyonki ve america naagarik the
 Swamy said that the editor of an Indian newspaper should not only be a resident of India, but should also be a citizen of India
 phone par baat karte hue varadarajan, jo samachar website da vir ke sansthaapak hai, ne kaha ki ''bijepi ke liye swami ko chunauti dena bahut kathin he
 In doing so, the BJP may have to face opposition from its axiomatic supporters, for whom Swami is a hero for speaking outright
 "party ke liye kya he upyogita?bijepi ke ek netaa kaa kahana he ki party swami ko ''unki utpaati yogyata" or virodhiyon kii naak main dam karne kii unki kshamta ke kaaran bardaasht kar rahi he
 It seems that Swamy's public statements may tickle some people, but they reveal differences within the party
 swami kii yogyata ko dekhte hue unki yah vartmaan dasha sachmuch dukhad he
 The most precious sign of love is the punishment for loving a girl in the Taj Mahal city of Agra
 ladki ke bhai ne hi use goli maar di
 Geeta and Akash loved each other
 jab gita ke bhai ravi ko iskaa pataa chalaa to usne pehle to gita ko goli maar di or phir akaash ko khojane uske ghar pahunch gaya
 When Akash could not be found, he shot at his father who was in his hand
 police ne aaropee bhai ko giraftaar kar liya he

 Recently, the official handle of Instagram announced the new feature for anti-bullying, saying, 'we know that bullying is a challenge that everyone faces, especially the younger generation
 ham online buling ke khilaaf ladaai main industry kaa netritv karne ke liye patibaddh hai, or ham us kamitment ko puraa karne ke liye instagram ke puure anubhav par punarvichaar kar rahe hai
 We can take steps to stop bullying on Instagram, and we can also do more to empower bulging targets by taking a stand for ourselves

 Announcing the anti-bullying feature by Instagram for Ananya Pandey and her initiative is a big step
 jab actress is pahal kii shuruyaat or samarthan karne kii yojana bana rahi thi tab is pahal ko shuru karne ke peeche thik yahi vichaar tha, jo aaj sarthak ho gaya he
 Today is Maha Shivaratri and early in the morning there are long queues outside the temples
 is vividhta vaale desh main bhagwaan bhole ko alag alag tareekon se prasann kiya jaataa he
 The 12 Jyotirlingas of Shiva established in the country have their own importance and history
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki bhagwaan shiv kii 5 prakaar kii aaratiyaan kii jaati he lekin sabase mahatvapurn aarti maani jaati he ' bhasma aarti'
 Yes, Bhakti Aarti is performed in Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga of Madhya Pradesh and it is not being done today but since ancient times
 to chaliye aaj is shubh avasar par aapako bataate hai bhasma aarti kaa rahasy or ise sampann karne kii vidhi-bhasma aarti kaa rahasyapuranon ke mutabik, kaaphi varshon purv ujjain main maharaj chandrasen kaa shashan tha
 He was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva and the people there also worshiped him a lot
 ek baar raja ripudaman ne chandrasen ke mahal par hamalaa bol diya or rakshas dooshan ke madhyam se vahaan kii praja ko bahut pratadit kiya
 Then all the people of Ujjain remembered Mahadev and pleaded with him
 kaha jaataa he mahadev ne unki pukaar suni or khud aakar us dusht rakshas kaa ant kiya
 Not only this, God adorned the ashes of corruption and settled there forever
 is tareeke se us jagah kaa naam padaa mahakaleshrwar or shuru ho gai mahadev kii bhasma aarti
 The method of Bhasma Aarti is such a belief that Bhasma Aarti is done to awaken Lord Shiva
 isi vajah se bhasma aarti mahakaleshrwar main praatah kaal chaar baje shuru ho jaati he
 Let me tell you, Bhasma is made with the entire Vidhan Vidhi
 sabase pehle kapila gaay ke conde, pipal, palash, shami or ber ke lakadiyon ko saath main jalaayaa jaataa he
 While lighting them, the priests of the place also chant
 phir us bhasma ko kapade ke madhyam se chaan liya jaataa he or use mahadev par arpit kiya jaataa he
 Lord Bhole is also adorned with the ashes of the first pyre lit at the crematorium in Mahakaleshwar
 hindu dharm ke anusaar agar vyakti kii chita se mahadev kaa shringaar kiya jaae, to us vyakti ko moksh kii prapti hoti he
 What is the rule? In Mahakaleshwar, it is forbidden for women to visit Bhasma Aarti
 lekin jo mahilaayein us samay vahaan upasthit hoti hai unhen sari pahananaa aavashyak he
 Apart from this, at the time when the ash is offered on the Shivling, all the women standing there should cover their face with a veil
 aisa kaha jaataa he us samay mahadev niraakaar rup main hote hai
 By the way, some strict rules are also for men
 vahaan aae sabhi purashon ko sooti kii dhoti pahananaa jaruri he
 In this temple, no common person can offer ash on the Shivling itself
 ye adhikaar vahaan ke sirf pujaariyon ke paas he
 Why apply Tilak of Bhasma? By applying Tilak of Bhasma on Mahashivaratri, the sins of all the devotees of Mahadev are washed away and their life is always stress-free and full of happiness

 Yuvraj Singh may have more experience, but Suresh Raina, who is in good form in the first Test match against England starting July 21, can be included in India's playing XI
 yuvaraj kii tarah hi baayen haath ke ballebaaj raina kaa lagaataar achche pradarshan ke kaaran lords test ke liye chunaa janaa tay he
 Yuvraj, five years senior to Raina, has never played a Test match at Lord's in his nine-year Test career
 lords hi vah sthaan he, jahaan 2002 main netwest trophy vanade siries ke final main bharat ne england ke 326 ran ke lakshya ko hasil kiya tha
 Yuvraj then had an innings of 69 runs
 isse pehle isi maidan par khele gaye vanade match main yuvaraj ne 64 ran banaae the
 He also excelled in the recent World Cup
 duusari ore, raina ne madhyakram main apni jagah majboot karne ke liye kaaphi mehnat kii he or is baat ko khaarij karne kii koshish kii he ki short pich gend unki kamajori hai
 The fast rising balls caused problems for Raina early in his Test career
 vah dakshin africa ke khilaaf centurian main pehle test match main paanch or ek ran hi bana paae, jiske baad agle do test match main unhen antim ekadash main nahin chunaa gaya
 Raina and Yuvraj's career so far has moved in the opposite direction
 raina ne jahaan maukon kaa phayda uthaaya, vahiin yuvaraj ne aise maukon ko ganvaaya
 Yuvraj was considered a regular member of the Test team after Sourav Ganguly retired
 lekin pichley saal srilanka main unhen flu hone ke baad jab raina ko mauka mila, to unhone apane pehle test match main hi shatak jad diya tha
 After that it was not easy for Yuvraj to make a place in the Test team
 yuvaraj ne ab tak england ke khilaaf chaar test match main 276 ran banaae hai, lekin isse unka daawa majboot nahin banataa, kyonki unhone ye sabhi match gharelu dharti par khele hai

 Skipper Kohli had a brilliant century on a challenging Perth wicket, while Cheteshwar Pujara played a decisive role in India's victory in Adelaide, but the other batsmen could not contribute to the match of the bowlers, who have taken all 40 wickets in four innings so far
 
 kohli ne tisare test kii purv sandhya par kaha, ‘yah ballebaajon ke liye behad mehtvapurn he ki ve jimmedaari len, kyonki sabhi dekh sakate hai ki hamaare gendbaaj kaaphi acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Otherwise the bowler will not be able to do anything with the score we are making
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘agar ham baad main ballebaaji karte hai, to badhat banane yaa virdohi team ke score ke jitna adhik sambhav ho utana adhik kareeb pahunchane kaa prayaas karte hai
 If you score too big then it becomes a second innings match and if you take a good lead in the first innings then you can take advantage of it
 ’jaaniye, aakhir kyon nikaale gaye rahul-vijay, hanuma ko bada maukakohli ne kaha, ‘ballebaajon ko samuhik prayaas karnaa hoga
 i personally would not say what one needs to do, but as a batting unit we definitely have to do better
 ’ bhartiya captain ne haalanki spasht kiya ki melbern test par unki edilade test main jeet yaa perth test main haar kaa koi asar nahin padegaa
 Virat said, "as a team, i don't think that going 2-0, going 0-2 or getting 1-1 has any effect on what is going to happen in the next two Tests
" ’nathan leone ne ab tak do test main 16 wicket chatkaakar bhartiya ballebaajon ko kaaphi pareshaan kiya he or kohli ne is of spinner kii jamkar tarif kii
 He said, "leon is a very good bowler
 He bowls consistently in a good field
 is tarah ke gendbaaj ke khilaaf hamaare paas yojana honi chahie jisase ki ham ran banane ke vikalpon ko bhi dhundh saken, kyonki agar use lambey samay tak ek hi jagah par gendbaaji karne di jaae to vah or adhik khatarnaak ban jayega
 'the last time India played on the MCG, that Test draw ended
 kohli or ajinkya rahane ne us match main shatak jade the
 Kohli said, 'last time, the pitch had a big role to play in favor of any team
 lekin ab pich ko dekhen, to is par pichhali baar kii tulana main kaaphi adhik ghaas he or main ummid karata hum ki yah jeevant pich hogi
 Mayank has a unique record, the golden chance he got in Team India

 There is a lot of grass on the pitch that will tie the surface
 ’kohli australia main duusari baar boxing de test khel rahe hai or ise lekar kaaphi utsuk hai

 Here are some tips that will help you a lot in this phase
 ye rahe kuch ahm suzav, jiskaa istemaal aap sooyeeboojh se kar sakate hai:1
 You should remove it from the mind that you are responsible for the breakup

 2
 kabhi bhi nashe kii avasthaa yaa uttejnaa main partner se baatcheet na karen
 It is better not to do such a thing in a state of intoxication than to say something upside down and then later sorry
 jo bhi kahen, sanyat hokar kahen
 3
 aapako yah bharosa hona chahie ki aapaki ahmiyat kisi bhi duusare shaks se kam nahin he
 Whoever you are, whatever you are, is unique in itself
 aap uske pyaar ke hakdaar hai, jo aapaki ahmiyat samajhe
 4
 is kaam main soshal media aapaki kaaphi madad kar saktaa he
 If you wish, you can seek help and opinion from Common Friends
 5
 If you do not like your old partner, then you should be firm on your thoughts
 man markar sambandh jodne kii baat dimag se nikaal den
 6
 brallep kii avasthaa main bhaawanaaon main bahane se acha he ki kuch positive sochaa jaae
 If nothing else, at least take measures to reduce your cause by 5-7 kg, which you have been thinking for a long time
 aap jis bhi profeshan main hon, usamen kuch or skills develop karen, jisase tarakkee kii raah khule
 There is no benefit from drinking alcohol or cigarettes, there are only disadvantages
 7
 Do take a lesson from the life passed, then use it in the journey ahead
 isse aapako us partner kii talash main madad milegi, jo aapke liye parfect ho
 Then you will get a far better partner than the old partner

 vahiin, 9 logon kii jaan chali gai to kai ghayal ho gaye
 After the attack, on 15 December 2001, Delhi Police arrested Afzal Guru, a member of the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed, from Jammu and Kashmir
 vahiin, dilli vishvavidhyalay ke jakir hossain college ke esar gilaani ke alaava do anya afasaan guru or uske pati shaukat hossain guru ko pakadaa gaya
 On December 18, 2002, the trial court hearing the case pronounced Afzal Guru, Shaukat Hasan and Geelani to be sentenced to death and Afsan Guru was acquitted
 hamale ke 12 saal baad di gai faansibad main 29 oktober 2003 ko gilaani dilli hoicourt se bari ho gaya
 Then the case reached the Supreme Court and on 4 August 2005, Shaukat Hasan's sentence-a death was changed to 10 years rigorous imprisonment
 afjal guru ko mili sajaa-e-maut mukarrar rahi or phir wo din aayaa jab afjal guru ko faansee mili
 On February 9, 2013, 12 years after the Parliament attack, convict Afzal Guru was crucified
 haalanki, aatankwaadi afjal guru ko aakhri vakt tak yahi lag rahaa tha ki uski bhi faansee kii sajaa badal jaaegi
 He hoped that his death sentence would be commuted to life imprisonment, but this did not happen
 8 farvari ko afjal guru ko bataaya gaya ki agle din subah 8 baje use faansee di jaaegi or ye sun use ye ehsaas ho gaya ki uski jindagi ke ye kuch aakhri pal hai
 Who was Afzal Guru, how did he become a terrorist? Afzal Guru was jaish-e-mohammed's terrorist and the mastermind of the attack on the Indian Parliament building
 iske itar afjal guru jammu-kashmir ke baraamula jile ke sopor kaa rahane vaala tha or embibies kii padhai karne ke saath-saath iees kii pariksha kii taiyaari bhi kar rahaa tha
 Later, he became a member of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front and from there he took terrorist training
 is dauraan afjal apane kaam ko lekar tarik naam ke shaks se mila, jisane use jihad ke liye uksaaya
 Tariq then introduced him to other terrorists in Ghaziabad, Pakistan
 vahaan par afjal ko fidine hamale kii training di gai
 Afzal Guru belonged to Jammu and Kashmir, so he felt that he would not be hanged, because it would make Kashmir furious
 haalanki, 3 farvari 2013 ko raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne afjal guru kii dayaa yachika thukraa di or 9 farvari 2013 ko use suuli par chadha diya gaya
 After this Afzal Guru's body was buried in Tihar itself

 kahin aisa to nahin ki aapke or aapke saathi ke bich aksar ladaai hoti rahati he? agar haa, to ye koi ghabaraane vaali baat nahin he
 It is said that in love love is necessary
 ladaai ke dauraan aksar aapke dimag main yah baat bhi gunj hi jaati hogi ki kahin ye ladaai aapke rishte kii gaharaai ko kam na kar de
 So do not panic, the outcome of every battle is not bad
 lekin haa, agar aap takaraar ke baad daraar chhodkar aage badhate hai, to ye aap donon ke rishte ke bhavishya ke liye acha nahin he
 It is important that before going ahead after the fight, erase the bad experiences behind
 aisa karne se aap donon ke bich hua vivaad, dard or daraaron kii jagah rishte ko majbootee dekar jayega
 Control your anger and try to keep your anger under control
 yakeen maniye, is tarah ke vivaad se aap donon ko kuch nayaa seekhney ko milegaa
 To avoid the bitter experience of better conversation, relationships and disputes, follow some measures
 apane saathi ko karen meljab kabhi aap donon ke bich kisi baat ko lekar bahut zyada bahes ho jaae, to us vishay par baatcheet ke alaava mail bhi karen
 Write everything you have in an email to your partner
 agar aap mail nahin karatin, to aap chitthee bhi likh sakati hai
 But yes, it also has a bad effect
 agar aapkaa saathi us mail yaa chitthee ko sambhalakar rakh legaa, to kabhi bhi usase nakaaratmakataa paidaa ho sakati he, isliye jab aapkaa kaam ho jaae, to kuch samay ke baad us chitthee yaa mail ko jad se khatm karvaa den
 Recognize the root cause of the problem
 It has happened between the two of you that you forget the real issue while fighting and start arguing on something else
 to mohatarama iskaa malatab he ki aap donon ke bich main aisi bahut si baaten hai, jinpar charchaa karnaa behad jaruri he
 Never stray from the real issue during the debate
 puraani baton ko bich main laane kii bajaae usee bare main baat karen, jise lekar us vakt aap donon kii bahes shuru hui ho
 So that it is habitual to take the things of women seriously among the peace-keeping men, so if you want them to stay in the room until you are finished, then keep calm instead of getting angry
 isse ek to aap pareshaani ko sulajhaa paaengi or doosraa gusse main apane rishte kaa bhi nuksaan nahin karengi

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Gujarat High Court lawyer Three Ozane has made serious allegations against Gujarat High Court judge MR Shah
 unhone ise lekar chif justise of india jees khehar ko letters bhi likhaa he
 Advocate Yatin Oja accused Judge MR Shah of converting 1 crore black money into a new currency with the help of the state government during demonetisation
 yatin oja ko amit shah ke menter ke taur par bhi janaa jaataa he
 After being sidelined from BJP, Yatin Oja joined Congress and then AAP
 yah he aaropoja ne letters kii shuruyaat main hi likhaa he ki aarope kaaphi gambhir hai
 Along with this, he has written that if his allegations prove to be false, then he is ready to bear any consequences for this
 unhone aarope sabit karne ke liye chif justise se is maamle kii nishpaksh or vistrut karwaane kii maang kii he
 Giving information about the charge, Oja has written that Judge Shah was the owner of a bungalow in Ahmedabad till july-august 2016
 haalanki shah or hai court ke duusare jajon ko hai court ke paas main jameen alot hone ke baad shah ne vah bangala 1 karod main bech diya
 Shah has alleged that the amount was made available in cash and Shah has not given any information about it
 aise mennotebandike dauraan jaj ke paas yah rakam 500 or hajaar rupee ke noton main hi thi, aise main rajya sarkaar kii madad se yah note nae karency main badale gaye
 He was assisted by a minister and a party leader
 oja ne likhaa he ki agar chif justise kisi nishpaksh jaj se is maamle kii jaanch karavaaenge to meri har baat sach sabit hogi
 The Collegium also mentioned in its letter about the collegium system being set up for appointment of judges
 oja ne letters main jaj keem joseph or jayant patel kaa zikr karte hue likhaa he ki ab collegium centre sarkaar ke saamne ghutane techne lagi he
 However, judges Madan B
 Lokur, Jasti Chelameswar and Kurian Joseph, who joined the collegium which was formed on August 28, hoped to make efforts to save the system
 pehle bhi rahaa he vivaadon se nathayah pehali baar nahin he jab yatin oja ne aise gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Yatin Oja had earlier claimed in a letter to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal that BJP president Amit Shah and Owaisi were meeting
 supreme court ne vakil yatin oja ko gujarat hai court ke do nyayadhishon ke khilaaf aapattijanak tippaniyan karne ke liye bina shart maafee maangane kaa nirdesh diya tha
 Former Supreme Court Chief Justice TS Thakur had reprimanded Oja for filing an affidavit and apologizing and that he would no longer give such statements against both the judges
 ojha ne bayaan diya tha ki gujarat hai court ke nyaayadhish emr shah or kees jhaveri samvidhan ke mutabik nahin, balki 7 res course road or 11 ashok road ke ishaare par kaam karte hai
 Due to this statement, contempt of court proceedings were started against Oja in the Gujarat High Court
 isi karrwai par roak ke liye yatin oja ne supreme court main arji lagaai thi
 Oja also alleged that some businessmen close to the BJP were already aware of demonetisation
 bhaajapa dwaara jhamumo ke netritv vaali sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene ke faisle or congress ke ‘intjaar karo or dekho’ kii niti apnaane ke saath hi jharkhand main raajnneetik anischitata bani hui he
 When asked about the party's strategy for Jharkhand, a top Congress leader said, "we are not currently involving ourselves in this issue
" hamase na to kisi ne baat kii he or na hi ham koi pahal kar rahe hai
 BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said on Thursday that the party's MLA will meet Governor moh Farooq and inform him about the decision to withdraw support from the Shibu Soren government
 is bich congress ke sheersh netaa ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki katautee prastaav ke dauraan loksabhaa main sorain kaa sarkaar ke paksh main matdaan karnaa suniyojit tha
 Asked whether Soren had voted accidentally or the Congress had talked to him about it, he said, "we ourselves wonder how this happened
" ’ saath hi kaha ki yah to sorain hi bataa sakate hai ki yah sab kuch kaise hua
 This leader also rejected the debate going on in political circles that there is an attempt to make Soren a minister at the center and to form a coalition government of congress-jmm-jvm in Jharkhand
 unhone kaha, ‘koi sawaal nahin uthta
 this is pointless
 congress or jhamumo ke bich koi samjhauta nahin hua he
 The Congress leader said that the party is adopting a wait and see policy and does not want to take any hasty step at the moment
 is bich jharkhand se congress ke varisht netaa or kendriya mantri subodh kaant sahay ne rajya main kisi ko mukhyamantri pad kii peshkash karne kii sambhaavna se inkaar kiya he
 He told reporters in the Parliament complex, 'we will not offer the Chief Minister's post to anyone in Jharkhand
 philhal ham intjaar karo or dekho kii niti apana rahe hai
 On the other hand, Soren has written a letter to senior BJP leaders LK Advani, Sushma Swaraj and party president Nitin Gadkari and apologized for voting against the nda's cut motion in the Lok Sabha
 unhone kaha ki kharaab swasthya kii vajah se aisa ho gaya or bhaajapa samarthan vaapasi ke apane faisle par punarvichaar kare
 The appeal of Soren seems to have had no effect on the BJP
 sushamaa ne kaha, ‘ham is patr se santusht nahin he or samarthan vaapasi kaa hamaara faisla kaayam he
 He also denied rumors that the BJP was trying to form a government there with a position of its chief minister and offering Soren's son Hemant the deputy chief minister's post
 sorain kii karrwai par jharkhand ke up mukhyamantri or bhaajapa kii rajya ikai ke pramukh raghuveer das ne ranchi main kaha, ‘galati manushya se hi hoti he or unhone (sorain ne) galati maan lee he
 Meanwhile, LJP general secretary Shamayle Nabi has demanded that immediate President's rule be implemented in Jharkhand as no political party or coalition is in a position to form the government

 The state government has started the 'indira Griha Jyoti Yojana', giving gifts to domestic electricity consumers
 ye yojana 25 farvari ke baad milane vaale bijli bilon se lagu ho jaaegi
 With this scheme, the electricity bills of the month for domestic electricity consumers are expected to be very cheap, as the consumers having consumption of up to 100 units within this scheme will get a maximum bill of Rs 100 only
 urja mantri priyavrat singh ne bataaya ki isse pehle sambal yojana main shaamil labhaarthiyon ko bhi is yojana main shaamil kiya jayega
 In this scheme only 100 units will be billed even if the average bill is more than 100 units, giving benefits to the consumers
 haalanki mantri priyavrat singh ne saaf kaha ki aise upabhokta jo air condishnar yaa room heater kaa istemaal karte hai unako is yojana kaa laabh nahin milegaa
 At the same time, under the scheme, domestic consumers living below the poverty line of scheduled castes, tribes will continue to get the benefits of Indira Griha Jyoti Yojana as before
 is yojana ko lagu karte hi sarkaar ne bijli companiyon ko billing software main jaruri badlaav karne ke nirdesh bhi de die hai jisase vakt par yojana kaa laabh jaruratmand logon ko mil sake
 Shivraj had given a warning, let me tell you that recently, Shivraj Singh Chauhan had gone to a slum in Bhopal and asked the Kamal Nath government to give electricity bills of Rs 100 to the poor
 is dauraan shivaraj ne jhuggivaasiyon ko manch se sambodhit karte hue sarkaar ko chetavanee di thi ki agar garibon ko 100 rupye bijli nahin di yo wo unase bill naa jamaa karne ke liye kahenge or agar unki bijli kati to wo khud jaakar conection jodenge

 Councilors are urging the top leaders of the party to save their chair and call the decision suicidal
 lekin ummid dilli ke saaton saansadon ke rukh se he
 More than one and a half hundred BJP councilors are upset with the ticket being cut
 inamen se sau se zyada to khulkar tiktabandi kaa virodh kar rahe hai or party ke netaaon ke paas jaakar faisle ko waapas lene kii muhim bhi ched chuke hai
 In the last three days, hundred councilors have knocked at the rate of top leaders and mps one by one
 bhale hi kai jagah par party ke bade netaaon ne parshadon ko is muhim ke liye jhidak diya ho, lekin parshadon kii lamabandi saansadon par asar karti dikh rahi he
 The impact that the councilors have given in unison against the Dalitiktbandi has also started showing
 parshadon ne netaaon ke ghar jaakar jataane kii koshish kii he ki sabhi parshadon kaa tikat kaatane kaa sandesh galat jayega or janata main party kii chhavi bhrashtachar vaali banegi
 At the same time, cutting the ticket without any reason will send a wrong message to the ward's workers and will reduce the morale of the supporters
 in daleelon ke saath parshadon ne saansadon se bhi mulaakaat kii
 Even if the mps have advised these councilors to accept the decision of the party
 lekin saansadon ko ye jarur ehsaas ho gaya he ki tiktabandi se hui parshadon kii lamabandi ek maheene ke bheetar hi hone vaale chunaav main party ko baari pad sakati he
 That is why some mps are also seen melting against the demand of councilors
 pashchimi dilli kesaansad pravesh vermake mutabik parshadon kii naaraazgi jaij he or tikat kaate jane se unka aahat hona bhi swaabhaavik he
 However, he said that the party has taken this decision thoughtfully and the councilors will also be considered eligible for the assembly ticket in the coming elections

 Staying in controversies is becoming in the habit of former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar

 During World Cup 2019, a tweet by Manjrekar made Team India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja so angry that he gave this former cricketer a chance to learn how to stay in the limits and respect the players
 vivaad us samay shuru hua jab manjrekar ne kaha tha ki vah bhartiya team main visheshgy ballebaaj or gendbaajon ko aniyamit ballebaajon-gendbaajon ke upar tarjeeh dete
 Before the match against Bangladesh in the World Cup-2019, Manjrekar had said that he would give Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal a place in the next match even after a poor performance against England

 When the Parliament House was attacked on 13 December 2001, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had planned the same airstrikes on terror bases located across the border as the Modi government did in Balakot
 jaish e mohammad ke aatankiyon ne jis tarah se dussahas kii hadein paar karte hue desh kii sansad ko nishaanaa banaaya tha, usne vaajapeyi ko airstrike kii yojana banane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 This has been revealed recently by a book published by former Naval Chief Admiral Sushil Kumar

 However, the air strike plan was canceled due to the intelligence report received at the last minute

 Therefore, it may be that the Prime Minister later came to know how severely that decision affected the armed forces

 patr ke mutabik rigerv bank of india ke byaaj daron main katautee na karne ke baavjood yah sambhav hoga
 Keep in mind that the Reserve Bank of India decides the interest rates in the country by increasing or cutting the repo rates
 lekin is baar is bank ke hi ek nirnay ke kaaran home or auto lone par byaaj kii daron main kami aegi
 Both these sectors are currently going through a recession
 real estate companiyon kii haalat khasta he kyonki graahak moti byaaj daron ke kaaran makaan lene se kataraa rahe hai
 The reduction in interest rates will be possible because the Reserve Bank has issued Rs 10,000 crore to commercial banks on Wednesday
 yah short turm lone jaisaa he
 This not only brought additional money to the banks, but also reduced interest
 ab bank bajet prastaavon ko dekhenge or phir byaaj daron main katautee karenge, haalanki rigerv bank ne aisa koi kadam abhi nahin uthaaya he
 Actually, overnight call money rate (the rate at which banks lend to each other) dropped to 6 between Monday and Thursday

 bankeron kaa maananaa he ki bank bina aadhaar daren ghataae hue byaaj daren ghataane ke bare main soch sakate hai
 But for this it is necessary that the rate at which they take money should not be more than 8 percent

 xxrep 8 ? As we fall back into our routine life, it is important to remember that any conversation about same-sex marriage is healthy (whether you agree with the views of others or not
 ) To open up someone's mind about something they know nothing about takes time and patience
 Anger and frustration is never the way to build awareness
 Give those uninformed a chance to learn and realize that LOVE is more powerful than any race, religion, gender, or preference
 Keep the conversation open

 ' Preity Zinta wrote a blog on her official Facebook page after accusing her ex boyfriend Ness Wadia of molestation
 is blog main unhone likhaa ki wo jo kuch bhi kar rahi hai uskaa makasad kisi ko chot pahunchaana nahin balki khud ke liye stand lenaa he
 Read what is written by Preity Zinta - i may not be very rich, but the truth is with me
 maine apni jindagi main bahut mehnat kii he
 Through my hard work, i have achieved a place in life
 mujhe ye kehete hue bahut dukh hota he ki jab-jab mere saath kaam karne ke dauraan badasluki hui kisi ne meraa saath nahin diya, lekin mere paas is baar sakht kadam uthaane ke alaava koi vikalp nahin bachaa tha
 Many times we are so embarrassed and humiliated that we fool ourselves, no one has seen what happened
 log aksar idhar-udhar dekhne lagate hai jaise ki wo vahaan maujuud hi nahi hai yaa ham vahaan maujuud nahin hai
 People are just ashamed to steal their eyes but not so embarrassed to interfere in the matter
 vidambnaa hi he ki vankhede main mere saath jo kuch bhi hua uske baad log mere charitra ko lekar kahaniyaan garh rahe hai lekin koi sach ke bare main baat nahin kar rahaa
 i am confident that the eyewitnesses there will tell the truth and the police will do their work swiftly and fairly
 koi bhi aurat is tarah ke vivaad main funsana nahin chaahegi, jis vivaad se philhal main guzar rahi hum
 i worked in the film industry for 15 years but never faced such insult and i thank all the men with whom i worked

 Every human has a limit on how long he can tolerate anything
 ham main se kuch murkh log ise takat kehete hai or jivan kii sakaaratmak chizon par focus karte hai
 i did not say anything against him (ness Wadia) in the media for so many years, but now i had no choice left
 main media or apane samarthakon se vinamratapurvak nivedan karti hum ki wo vankhede main jo hua us ghatana or is maamle par focus karen
 Do not turn this incident or me into a TV soap
 ye mere liye bhi aasaan nahin he or meraa makasad kisi ko bhi chot pahunchaana nahin he balki khud kii raksha karnaa or khud ke liye stand lenaa he
 i do not want any sympathy from anyone but sincerely i request you not to take my reputation from me in this battle of honor at the workplace
 mujhe lagata he itane saalon ke baad main itnaa to diserv karti hi hum or main aapse zyada kuch nahin maang rahi hum

 beshak mohinder amarnath ne sunil gavaskar, sachin tendulkar, rahul dravid or saurabh ganguli jitne ran nahin banaae, lekin bade-bade diggaj unhen in khilaadiyon se kahin kam bhi nahin aankate
 Amarnath is affectionately called 'jimmy'
 aaj ve apana 64waan janmdin manaa rahe hai
 The level of what Amarnath was a player can be gauged from the fact that big legends like Sunil Gavaskar, Imran Khan, Vivian Richards, David Boon, Michael Holding, Malcolm Marshall and Kapil Dev never tired of praising him
 apane jivan main ‘master of kam back’ ke naam se jane jane vaale mohinder amarnath ne apane kariyar kii shuruyaat australia ke khilaaf 1969 main fast bowling olerounder ke rup main kii
 But he was dropped from the team after one match, and after that he had to wait more than 6 years to return to the national team
 1983 main kapil dev kii captaini main bharat ne vishwa cap jitkar itihaas banaaya
 But Mohinder Amarnath played the biggest role in making that history
 england ke khilaaf semifinal main amarnath ne maatr 27 ran dekar david gavar or mike gating ke mahatvapurn wicket chatkaaye
 After this, Amarnath came out to bat and played a brilliant 46-run innings to bring India to the final
 amarnath ‘main of da match’ rahe
 In the final, India faced the most dangerous team of the time with the West Indies
 westeindies ne toss jitkar bharat ko ballebaaji karne kii daavat di, lekin bharat kii team mailcome marshall, maaikel holding, endi robrts or joel garnor kii sanasanaati gendon ke saamne maatr 183 ran par hi dher ho gai
 In front of the bowling balls of the Caribbean bowlers, it was difficult for the Indian batsmen to stand in the crease, while Amarnath scored 26 runs from 80 balls, presenting an amazing struggle
 baad main gendbaaji karte hue bhi amarnath kaa pradarshan laajawab rahaa or unhone sirf 12 ran dekar 3 keemtee wicket liye, or bharat vishwa champion ban gaya
 Amarnath was not only elected 'man of the Match' but was also awarded the 'man of the Series' title
 amarnath ke liye sabase badhiya sijan 1982-83 kaa tha, jab ve 3 saal baad team main vaapasi kar rahe the
 He scored 1182 runs in 11 Tests against West Indies and Pakistan and scored 5 centuries
 yah pradarshan khaas isliye ho jaataa he, kyonki us samay pakistan or westeindies donon ke paas sabase behtareen gendbaaj hua karte the
 The dedication and love Amarnath showed towards cricket is an example for the youth

 prarthana sthalon par mahilaon se hote bhedbhaav ke maamalon main maharashtra rajya sarkaar ne spasht rukh apanaaya he
 The government has refused to support such a ban
 mumbai ke prasiddh haji ali dargah main mahilaon ke pravesh par jari paabandi par sunwaayee ke dauraan maharashtra sarkaar ne bombai hai court ne apana paksh rakhaa he
 The state government has termed the ban on the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah of Mumbai as unconstitutional
 sarkaar kii taraf se is paabandi ke maamle par raay spasht karte hue mahadhivaktaa srihari ane ne kaha, jo reeti-rivaaj islam kaa hissaa nahin unke anusaran par trust khulaasa karen
 The prohibition on women going to the tomb is contrary to the right to equality as enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution
 apane rukh ke samarthan main sarkaar ne kuch udhaaharan bhi court ke saamne pesh kiye
 It has been said from the government that, if the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal built in Taj Mahal, Tajuddin Baba Darga of Nagpur, Ajmer Sharif Dargah or Salim Chishti Dargah of Fatehpur, there is no discrimination on the entry of women
 aise main haji ali par roak kaa samarthan nahin ho saktaa
 During the hearing on the matter, the government also said that the ban on Sabarimala and Shani Shingnapur cannot be compared to the ban on Haji Ali dargah
 kyonki, dargah kii paabandi haal hi main lagu hui he
 Whereas Shani is an age-old ban in Shinganapur and Sabarimala which is part of the tradition
 gyaat ho ki haji ali dargah kii majaar par 2011 tak mahila jairinon ko be rokatoke pravesh diya jaataa tha
 On the other hand, the Haji Ali Trust, while supporting the ban, has argued in the court that, since Haji Ali is the tomb of a male saint, the entry of women is banned there
 tippaniyan Indian Muslim Women Movement co-founders Zakia Soman and Nur Jahan Safia Niaz have filed a petition in the High Court
 sarkaar ke rukh ko lekar NDTV india se baat karte hue noorjahan ne kaha ki, unka sanghathan is sarkari rukh kaa swaagat karata he
 i wish we had not been able to go to court if we had taken this stance in advance
 bhartiya muslim mahila andolan ne 2012 main tatkaaleen congress-ensipi sarkaar se dargah par hote bhedbhaav main dakhal dene kii baat kahi thi
 But his point was unheard
 mangalvaar ko hoicourt main is maamle kii sunwaayee puri hui
 Now waiting for the final verdict
 rajya sarkaar ne mumbai ke haji ali dargah main mahilaon ke pravesh par lagi paabandi ko asanvaidhanik bataaya he
 Explaining the government's opinion on this ban case, Advocate General Shrihari Ane said that the trust should be disclosed to those who are not part of the custom of Islam

 In such a situation, the ban on Haji Ali cannot be supported
 is maamle par sunwaayee ke dauraan sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha ki, sabarimala or shani shinganapur main jari paabandi kii tulana haji ali dargah kii paabandi se nahin ho sakati
 Because, the banning of dargah has come into force recently
 jabaki shani shinganapur or sabarimala main varshon puraani paabandi he jo parampara kaa hissaa he
 It is to be known that till 2011 at the tomb of Haji Ali Dargah, women zerines were given entry to Bay Roktok
 duusari taraf haji ali trust ne paabandi kaa samarthan karte hue court main yah tark diya he ki, chunki haji ali ek purush sant kii majaar he isliye vahaan mahilaon ke pravesh par roak lagaai gai he

 The hearing of the case was completed in the High Court on Tuesday
 ab antim faisle kaa intjaar he
 During the hearing on the matter, the government also said that the ban on Sabarimala and Shani Shingnapur cannot be compared to the ban on Haji Ali dargah
 kyonki, dargah kii paabandi haal hi main lagu hui he
 Whereas Shani is an age-old ban in Shinganapur and Sabarimala which is part of the tradition
 gyaat ho ki haji ali dargah kii majaar par 2011 tak mahila jairinon ko be rokatoke pravesh diya jaataa tha
 On the other hand, the Haji Ali Trust, while supporting the ban, has argued in the court that, since Haji Ali is the tomb of a male saint, the entry of women is banned there

 Well, when we have not given up the resources of the earth, then why would we be averse to ending human civilization? Yet the anatomy (physiological) of the extinction of trust or gradual diminution must be understood, do you know that some people have gone out in the campaign to save it! The answer to this question is hidden in the functioning of the brain
 Is the kind that keeps our bad and good experiences
 mjedaar baat yah he ki ham kai baar us sandarbh ko bhul jate hai jisase hamen bure anubhav mili the, lekin us anubhav kaa kadavaapan hameshaa dimag ke kisi kone main bana rahata he
 a part of the brain is the trust network (where thoughts and feelings are found)
 This field serves to form our opinions about other people based on the experiences we have received from society
 ab jaise hi ham kisi vyakti ke baar main sochate hai to usase yaa vaise hi kisi vyakti se jude anubhav is network ko jhakzor dete hai
 If past experiences are correct then trust builds up and otherwise trust is broken
 to kya ateet ke anubhav badale ja sakate hai?puraane ghaav bhar jate hai lekin tis to bachi hi rahati he
 Just to eliminate this pain 'cognition thirapi'
 dimag kii almaari se puraane data delit kar vahaan par nae data karine se bharne hai
 
 
 But it is not easy to do it, because perceptions break down
 lekin asal sawaal yah he ki kya jarjar ho chuke bharose ke pul kii marammat karne ke liye koi andolan chalegaa? kya vyaktitv ke vilupt hote is ahm hisse ko bachaane kii koi muhim chalaai jaaegi yaa jaise ridh kii haddi kaa sabase nichalaa hissaa jise codel kehete poonch ke avshesh ke rup main yaad kiya jaataa he vaise hi ham kabhi vyaktitv ke is ahm hisse ke bare main itihaas main padhenge? haalanki siyasat se lekar samaaj tak ise khatm karne kii hode machi he usase to saaf he ki jald hi 'bharosa' itihaas ho jayega
