 US President Donald Trump has once again become a laughing stock about his tweet
 srilanka main hue bam visphoton main 13 karod 80 lakh logon ke marane kii baat kehane vaale trump galat ssailing likhane ke kaaran hansi kaa paatr ban gaye the
 Trump wrote on Twitter that special counsel Robert Muller should not appear before Congress
 america raashtrapati ne pehle kaha tha ki vah mular ko gavaahi se nahin rokenge or is par antim nirnay artani general wiliam lenge
 Muller's 448-page investigative report found no evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election
 haalanki unki gavaahi se congress ko aisi nai jaankariyaan mil sakati hai jo anyathaa saamne nahin aa sakin
 Despite the tremendous success that i have had as President, including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history, they have stolen two years of my (our) Presidency (collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back
 
 
 
 
 trump ne twit kiya, ‘raashtrapati ke rup main mujhe mili jabardast safalataa, shaayad itihaas ke kisi bhi raashtrapati kii sabase badi arthvyavastha or sabase safal pehle do varshon ke kaarykaal sahit kai uplabdhiyon ke baavjood unhone mere raashtrapati kaarykaal ke do varsh chura (stolan) liye jo kabhi waapas nahin aaenge
 In the tweet, Trump had added two 'L' to the spelling of the English word 'stollen', which means a fruit bread of spices and dried or candied fruit
 trump ne baad main apni galati sudhaar lee lekin tab tak vishvabhar main unka do el vaala ‘stolan' shabd mashhoor ho chukaa tha

 Vidhan Sabah Lok Sabha by-election Results 2019 Live Updates: jaane upachunaav ke apadet Ferozeshah Kotla of Delhi is eagerly awaiting the victory of Dhoni's men along with the whole country
 chennai, hyderabad or mohali main vijay kii pataakaa fahraane ke baad ab mahendra singh dhoni ke dhurandhar shuukravaar ko itihaas rachane ke iraade se chauthe or antim test match ke liye australia ke khilaaf firozshah kotla maidan par utrenge
 If Team India wins in Delhi then the team will be able to win a series 4–0 for the first time in 81 years of Test history
 nishchit taur par yah us team ke liye mahaan pal hoga, jo 27 varsh kii ausat umr ke saath mizaaj se to noujvaan he lekin khel ke lihaaj se paripakv hoti dikh rahi he
 Kotla, who has witnessed many records in his 65-year history, will also be eagerly awaiting this historic moment
 yah vahi maidan he, jahaan sunil gavaskar ne sar don breadman ke 29 shatakon ke kirtiman kii barabari kii thi
 This is the same ground where Anil Kumble equaled Glenn Turner's great achievement by taking all 10 wickets in an innings of a Test match against Pakistan
 ab yahi maidan apane yuva bankuron ko ek aisi safalataa hasil karte hue dekhne ko betaab hoga, jise 81 saal ke itihaas main 250 se adhik test star nahin hasil kar sake
 Kotla's pitch can also be helpful in India's Queen's way of swiping and creating a history
 pich par ghaas nahin he or iske shuruaati do dinon main ballebaajon ko or phir spinneron ko madad pahunchane kii ummid jataai gai he
 On the fourth and fifth day, it takes a very dangerous form for foreign batsmen
 aise main bharat apane teenon spin gendbaajon-ravichandran aswin, rabindra jadeja or pragyan ojha ke saath hi khelnaa chahega
 All three had won in Mohali by sharing wickets among themselves
 tej gendbaaji kii kaman bhubaneshwar kumaar or ishanth sharma par hi rahegi
 Delhi's Shikhar Dhawan, who scored a record century in the very first match of his career in Mohali, is injured and Ajinkya Rahane is likely to get a chance to make his Test debut
 vaise to kaayade se yah sthaan gautam gambheer ko mil rahaa tha lekin pilia hone ke kaaran vah bhi khilne kii sthiti main nahin hai
 Rahane has been with the Indian team for 11 months without playing any match
 ab jabaki unka pardaapan karnaa nishchit dikhaai de rahaa he, to dilli ke cricketpremiyon or team ko unase usee tarah kii ballebaaji kii ummid he, jaisi ki ve twanti-20 maichon main kiya karte hai
 Everything is going well for the Indian team but there is no end to the problems for Australia
 ballebaaji or gendbaaji main prabhavit karne vaale mishael stark swadesh laut chuke hai or captain maaikel clark kii qamar main dard he
 The good thing is that vice-captain Shane Watson has returned to India after the birth of his child
 clark shuukravaar ko toss ke liye aaenge yaa nahin, yah saaf nahin ho sakaa he
 However, in the event of Clarke not playing, Watson will have the distinction of becoming the 44th Test captain of Australia
 team kii ore se aid kowan ne watson ke prati buudhvaar ko hi vishwaas jaahir kiya tha
 It is expected that after the birth of the child, Watson's misfortune would have left him and now he will not only succeed in batting and lead his team, but will also succeed as a captain and give his team a confident return to the team
 Would like kotla main bharat or australia ke bich yah saatvaan match hoga
 So far India has won two matches while Australia has won one
 teen match barabari par chute hai
 India defeated Australia in 1996 and 1969
 is maidan par bharat beete 26 saal se koi test nahin haara he
 He was last defeated by the West Indies by five wickets in 1987
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki dhauni ke yuva saathi is ricard ko barkaraar rakhane ke saath-saath australia ko 4-0 se haraakar ek itihaas kaayam kar pate hai yaa nahin

 apane hi desh main begaane ho chuke rohingya muslimon ko koi bhi desh apnaane ko taiyaar nahin
 There are about 40 thousand Rohingya Muslims living illegally in India, who are also raising the voice to send them back

 Modi government puts pressure on Myanmar: Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid in Imam Bukhari, Delhi, said the barbaric way in which the Rohingya Muslims are being murdered in Kimyanmar is a shame on humanity
 modi sarkaar se ham ummid karte hai ki insaani hamadardi ke tahat myanmar sarkaar par dabaav banaae, taaki hinsa or katleam ruk sake
 Hindustan has been helping troubled people for centuries
 aise main sarkaar rohingya muslimon ke saath bhi usee parampara kaa nirvaahan karegi

 myanmar khuleam maanavadhikaronkaa ullaghann kar rahaa he or sanyukt raashtra chupchaap baitha he
 Whereas UN should interfere in this matter, so that peace can be established there
 bharat rah rahe rohingya muslimon ko sthai samaadhaan ke baad hi waapas myanmar bheja jaae
 It would be against humanity before sending them back
 jaalim ho chuki hamyanmar sarkaar: kalbe rushaidashia dharmaguru moulana kalbe rushayd kehete hai, mai hameshaa se majaloom ke saath or jaalim ke khilaaf rahaa hum
 The rule found in any elected government or discourse operates in only two conditions
 na imaan se hat ke ho or na hi insaaniyat se ghat ke ho
 Seeing the picture of Rohingya Muslims, it was realized that the Government of Myanmar has become bloodthirsty
 rohingya muslim ke maamle par saudi arab kii khamoshi samaj se pare he

 India's Union Minister of State for Home Kiran Reijiju's statement is embarrassing
 hindustan kii tahjeeb rahi he ki wo hamensha peediton kii madad karata rahaa he
 Tamilians from Sri Lanka or Afghanis from Afghanistan

 India has a relationship with Burma
 aise main bharat rohingya muslim ke mudde kaa samaadhaan kar saktaa he
 Rohingya Muslims are also living in India in considerable numbers

 Apart from Chidambaram, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala also surrounded the Modi government
 surajevaala ne twit kiya ki pichley 19 dinon se sirf karnataka main vot paane ke liye hi petrol-deazal ke daam nahin badaye gaye the
 But once again people will have weight on their pockets
 somvaar ko bade petrol-deazal ke damapako bataa den ki petrol or dijal kii keemton main pichley 19 dinon se brake laga tha, lekin karnataka main voting khatm hote hi daam badha die gaye hai
 On Monday, oil companies increased the prices of petrol and diesel
 karnataka main voting ke do din baad hui is badhotaree se dijal ne 66 rupee kaa aankada paar kar liya he
 At the same time, petrol in Delhi has reached the highest level of 56 months

 At the same time, its price in Mumbai is 82

 karnataka main matdaan khatm hote hi bade petrol ke daam, jaaniye kitna hua mahangaa Hizbul Mujahideen's poster boyatanki Burhan Wanike encounter in Kashmir led to sudden tensions and incidents of stone pelting in the valley
 iske chalate pichley saal jammu-kashmir main kai tarah ke ehtiyathan kadam rajya sarkaar or centre sarkaar ko uthaanaa padaa tha
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has stated in a written reply in Lok Sabha that the incidents of stone pelting were in April, May and June
 gauratlab he ki 8 july ko aatanki burhan vaani ke encounter ke baadapatharbajchanak bad gai
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has said in a written reply in Lok Sabha that in April 2016, 97 stone pelting took place in Bar Kashmir
 vahiin may or june 2016 main kramshah 32 or 66 baar stone pelting kii ghatnaayen huin
 But as soon as the militant Burhan Wani was attacked by security forces, in July, 837 times stones were fired at different places in the Kashmir Valley
 darasal jaise hi 8 november ko centre sarkaar nenotbandika elaan kiya
 The subsequent figures show that the stonewalling decreased, according to the figures of the Ministry of Home Affairs, which in November 2016, 73 stone-pelting incidents occurred in a month
 vahiin, disambar or janvari main kramshah 36 or 17 hi patharbaji kii ghatnaayen hui
 It is clear that the effect of demonetisation is seen in the stonewalling
 aapako bataa denki jammu-kashmir main sthaneey naujavaanon ko patharbaji karne ke liye paise die jate hai
 a stoner had even told a few days ago on the intelligence camera that till date he gets 500 to five thousand rupees for this work
 patharbaj ne kabool kiya ki hijbul mujahiddeen ke ugravadi burhan vaani kii maut ke baad hue hue hinsak pradarshnon ke dauraan bhi usne patharbaji karwaai thi
 Dussehra air pollution in Delhi has come down to a five-year low

 Whereas Dussehra had 326 (very Poor) in 2018, Dussehra 196 (moderate) in 2017, Dussehra 223 (poor) in 2016 and Dussehra in 2015 with AQI 292 (poor)
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne iske liye ramlila samitiyon ko badhai di he
 Kejriwal tweeted and said, 'congratulations to all Ramlila committees for burning firecrackers on Dussehra
 samaaj main koi bhi bada badlaav logon ke sahyog ke bina sambhav nahin hota
 The success we have achieved in reducing both dengue and pollution has been achieved with the cooperation of all people
 'dilli main is baar green pataakhe kaa istemaal kiya gaya jiske chalate vaayu or dhwani pradooshan main kami mahasoos kii gai
 According to weather experts, there are two main reasons why Delhi has so little pollution on Dussehra this year
 pehla kaaran he ki is samay monsoon laut rahaa he jisaki vajah se hawa kii gati tej he
 Even if there is pollution due to high wind speed, it flies away
 doosraa kaaran he ki punjab or haryana main abhi hawa main kaaphi nami he jiske chalate paraali ke jalane se hone vaala pradooshan dilli kii taraf nahin aa rahaa
 The Supreme Court has taken a tough stand against the Amrapali group for not completing real estate projects and not giving flats to buyers
 sheersh adaalat ne amrapali samooh ke 3 diarectaron kopulice hiraasatamen lene kaa aadesh diya he
 On Tuesday, a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and UU Lalit called the police inside the court and ordered that Amrapali Group directors Anil Kumar Sharma, Shove Priya and Ajay Kumar be detained until they are subjected to forensic audit Complete documents are not provided
 supreme court ne kaha ki in diarectaron ne saal 2015 se apane acount tak taiyaar nahin kiye
 They are also accused of putting home buyers' money elsewhere
 jab tak auditors ke zaruri kagajaat muhaiyaa nahin karaae jate hai, tab tak teenon diarector police hiraasat main hi rahenge
 Police custody can take from one day to one month
 isse hamen koi fark nahin padataa
 When the Supreme Court did not comply with its earlier order, when we asked to give all the records in 24 hours on September 26, then why the order has not been implemented till now? The apex court has asked the Delhi Police, Noida Police and Greater Noida Police to coordinate with each other and seize all account related records and submit them to the auditors
 court ne amrapali diarectaron ko avmaananaa kaa notice bhi jari kiya or poocha ki kyon na inke khilaaf avmaananaa kaa mukadmaa chalaaya jaae
 Earlier in August, the top court gave a stern warning to the Managing Director and Directors of Amrapali Group that if you tried to show cunning to us, there would be serious consequences
 ham aapako beghar kar denge
 The Supreme Court had clearly told the Managing Director and Directors of Amrapali Group that you have forced people to wander for home
 ham aapaki sari sampatti bech denge
 Will sell your house too
 aap bhi aise hi apane ghar ko dekhenge jaise duusare flats kharidaar dekh rahe he
 The court had asked them how you would collect Rs 5,112 crore by selling your properties
 iskaa prapojal dekar hamako bataaen, taaki adhure houseing project ko puraa kiya ja sake
 The Supreme Court had also asked the directors and promoters of Amrapali Group to furnish full details of their movable and immovable properties
 iske saath hi sheersh court ne bijli companiyon ko nirdesh diya tha ki ve amrapali samooh kii do pariyojnaon main bijli aapurti behaal karen
 The electricity supply to Silicon City and the Zuniaq project was shut down due to the electricity bill remaining unpaid

 India will soon achieve the title of world's fastest growing economy and will overtake China by 2016
 sabhi akhbaaron ne vishwa bank or antarrashtriya mudra kosh kii is bhavishyavaanee ko pramukhataa se chapa he
 Both these institutions believe that China's GDP in 2016 will decrease to 6
 3 par aa jaaegi or bharat kii badhkar 7
 It will be 5
 ek pratishat ke antar se bharat or china kii aarthik duniya kitni badal jaaegi, yah samajhnaa mere liye mushkil to nahin he, par main thik-thik nahin bataa saktaa ki kyon yah badi baat nahin he
 By the way, in today's 'times of India', there has been news that China's economy has suffered the fastest decline since 2009
 duniya kii duusari sabase badi arthvyavastha 2009 se sanbhal nahin saki he
 On Wednesday, The Economic Times wrote that the government would also like the news of overtaking China, because we have never been able to get ahead of China
 phir yah bhi daleel di jaati he ki bharat aage nikal bhi gaya, to bhi china kii arthvyavastha ke aakaar ke hisaab se kaaphi peeche rahegaa
 The size of China's economy is ten trillion and that of India is two trillion
 aakaar main aap chote hai, magar raftaar main aage
 This happens on a hundred meter track, what happens in the race of economy too
 'iconomik times' ne likhaa he ki bharat upbhog kii jagah nivesh kii arthvyavastha kii taraf bad rahaa he, jabaki china ab nivesh kii jagah upbhog kii arthvyavastha ko apana rahaa he
 There was another news in 'economics Times' of Wednesday itself, but on the inside page
 bharat niryaat ke maamle main lagaataar pichad rahaa he
 The World Trade Organization has stated that worldwide exports are declining, as economies around the world are still in critical condition
 2014 main antarrashtriya vyapaar vruddhi kii dar 4
 7 percent was stated, but Hui 2
 8 pratishat hi
 Why the World Trade Organization and the World Bank give different estimates, this makes a weak student like me confused
 sevaaon ke niryaat ke maamle main japan or netherland tezi se aage nikal rahe hai
 India has fallen from sixth to eighth position
 bharat ne paanch saal kii ek niryaat niti bhi banaai, jise lekar kai aalochanaayen ho rahi hai
 Rather, those pro-modi industrialists have questioned the export policy by writing articles in newspapers
 phir bhi aap sarkaar ke aatmavishvaas ko dekhen to lagata he ki wo kaaphi aashwast he ki arthvyavastha palat rahi he
 Today, another news has appeared on the front page of 'times of India'
 bhartiya bainkon ke rin diye jane kii vikaas dar pichley 18 saal main sabase nichle str par he
 In general, we must have understood that if the economy picks up, then companies will take very good loans from banks for investment
 pichley saal kii tulana main 8 lakh karod adhik karz kaa uthaan hua he, lekin itani kam vruddhi to aakhri baar 1996-97 main hui thi
 Did we get there sarkaar kahati he ki usne lambit pariyojnaon ko manzuri de di he
 Banks say that when the government starts pending projects, then the debt will probably be raised

 Just before taking oath as Maharashtra CM, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis has made a big statement
 unhone shivasena ke saath bijepi ke gathbandhan ke baad ham rajya main ek majboot or sthai sarkaar dene ja rahe hai
 He did this while addressing party workers
 devendra fadanvis ne kaha ki sarkaar banane se judi prakriya kii shuruyaat diwaali ke baad se kii jaaegi
 The mandate given by the public is in favor of the bjp-shiv Sena alliance
 or ham aane vaale dinon main rajya main ek sthai or majboot sarkaar dene ja rahe hai
 This statement of Devendra Fadnavis came at a time when Shiv Sena has spoken in writing on 50-50 formula before forming the BJP Shiv Sena coalition government in the state
 kuch din pehle shivasena ne apane sabhi vidhayakon ke saath baithak karne ke baad yah baat kahi thi
 In the meeting of the Legislative Party, it was decided that the BJP should first give in writing that it is agreeable to the formula of 50-50 for the Chief Minister for two and a half years
 shivasena vidhayak ramesh latake meeting khatm hone ke baad ki saare adhikaar uddhav ji ko diye gaye hai
 Whatever he says will happen
 vahiin ek or shivasena vidhayak pratap sarnaik ne kaha tha ki bijepi jab tak likhit main nahi degi tab tak shivasena sarkaar main shaamil nahin hogi
 The 50 - 50 formula, which has been decided, should be a two-and-a-half year chief minister under it
 maharashtra ke zyaadaatar shiv sena vidhayak chaahate hai ki is baar shiv sena ko mukhyamantri kaa pad diya jaye or yah pad aditya thakare ko mili
 These mlas say that they have new thinking
 vidhansabha chunaavon main shivasena ko 56 siten milin hai
 Let us tell you that the BJP has reduced about 20 seats compared to the last time and it will need the support of a third party to form the government
 shivasena isi baat kaa phayda uthaanaa chaahati he kyonki pichhali baar ke chunaav main bijepi ne akele chunaav ladaa tha or sarkaar par puri tarah se kabja kar liya
 But this time things have changed
 yahi vajah he ki shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne baagh (shivasena kaa chinh) kaa ek cortoon ttitor par share kiya he, jiske gale main ghadi (ensipi kaa chunaav chinh) or haath main camel kaa phool (bijepi kaa chunaav chinh) he
 There is also another discussion in Maharashtra that NCP may support Shiv Sena

 prafull kumaar mahant bhartiya raajnneeti ke aisa cheharaa hai jinhone mahaj 32 saal kii umr main sabase kam umr ke mukhyamantri banane kaa tamgaa hasil kiya
 Mahant first became the Chief Minister of Assam in 1985
 mahant ne assam andolan kaa netritv kiya tha
 When the Asom Gana Parishad got a majority in 1985, Taj Prafulla Kumar Mahanta was beheaded
 bachapan se netritv kii kshamtaprafull kumaar mahant kaa janm 23 disambar 1952 ko assam ke nagaanv main hua
 He had leadership ability since childhood
 guwahati uniwarsity se inhone grajuation kii degree lee or phir raajnneeti main sakriy ho gaye
 The Mahant was going up the stairs of politics
 lekin saaye kii tarah vivaad bhi peechha kar rahaa tha
 Mahanta once again held the post of Chief Minister of Assam from 1996 to 2001 after completing the term of 1985-90
 lekin is bich unki raajnneeti par vivaad haaavee ho gaya
 Allegations of accusations started coming in from all sides and he was forced to leave power in 2001
 kamyaabi ke saath-saath gumnamisatta ke saath-saathmahantaparty adhyaksh pad se bhi bedakhal kar die gaye
 The charges were serious and anonymity followed

 In personal life too, the dispute took place and allegations of extramarital affairs took place
 party ke ek gut ne raaton-raat mahant ko party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Mahant, who created history by becoming the world's youngest Chief Minister, suddenly became untouchable in Assam's politics within two decades
 lekin mahant ne haar nahin maani or unhone alag assam gana parishad (pragatisheel) naam kii party bana lee
 And jumped into the 2006 assembly election
 is chunaav main keval mahant hi jeet hasil kar paae
 The rest of the party's candidates lost badly

 The then president Vrindavan Goswami vowed to never let Mahanta return to the party
 ol assam students union (aasu) ne mahant virdohi abhiyaan shuru kar diya tha
 On the other hand, without Mahant, the Asom Gana Parishad was getting weaker day by day

 bhaajapa mahasachiv ram madhav ne ravivaar ko kaha ki assam ke vitt mantri himant biswa sarama kii ahmiyat purvottar main kshetra se jude maamalon main party adhyaksh amit shah se zyada he
 Ram Madhav asked when asked why Sarma cannot contest elections despite being responsible for 25 seats while Amit Shah is contesting from Gandhi Nagar even after being BJP President
 ram madhav ne yaha ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, "iskaa matlab yah he ki shaayad himanta biswa sarama par amit se zyada boj he, kyonki unhen yahaan 5-6 sarkarein sanbhaalani hai
 He has to handle the entire election campaign in the Northeast
 " darasal, bhaajapa kii rajya ikai himant biswa sarama ko loksabhaa chunaav ladvane kii maang kar rahi thi, lekin party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne sabhi atakalon par viraam lagaate hue twit kiya tha ki sarama ko rajya ke vikaas or purvottar main party ke aadhaar ko majboot karne par dhyaan kendrit karne ke liye kaha gaya he
 Himanta Sarma also said that he has "humbly" accepted the decision and that the region would not disappoint Amit Shah in making Narendra Modi the Prime Minister again
 haalanki, isse pehle sarama ne swayan kai avasaron par kaha tha ki vah 2021 main rajya main vidhansabha chunaav nahin ladenge, saath hi yah sanket diya tha ki vah ab ek rashtriya bhoomika kii talash main hai
 BJP sources said that while preparing a panel of state unit names for the election, he was nominated as a candidate from the prestigious Tezpur parliamentary constituency in Assam
 haalanki aisa nahin hua
 Ram Madhav also said that the party may consider sending Himanta Sarma to the Rajya Sabha from Assam
 itnaa hi nahin, ek anyabhaajapa ke varisht netaa ne yah bhi kaha ki sarama party ke yuva sadasyon or sahanubhuti rakhane waalon ko manaa lenge, jo unhen tikat nahin die jane se naaraaz hai

 ) When the Indian Air Force was trying to locate its missing pilot on the Pakistani soil and Pakistan was releasing the video of the Wing Commander Abhinandan claiming to be in his possession, the country's Home Minister took a political stance in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh
 Was participating in the program

 On the other hand, the entire opposition was holding its pre-decided meeting within the Parliament premises to decide the minimum common program in view of the Lok Sabha elections
 nihsandeh bhartiya ardhsainikbalon kii shahadat or seemaa par tanaav ke baavjood raajnneetik partiyon ke kaaryakramon par koi khaas fark najar nahin aayaa
 In particular, this allegation is being made directly by the opposition on the basis of the programs of the Bharatiya Janata Party
 vipaksh kaa kahana he ki bhaajapa or centre sarkaar pakistan ke saath tanaav kaa raajnneetik istemaal karne or chunaav main iskaa phayda arjeet karne main juty hui he
 The opposition has its own arguments for this allegation
 jis vakt desh ke ek bade hisse main hawaii sevaayen thapp thim, kai hawaii addon ko haclert par rakhaa gaya tha or seemapar se zordaar golabari ho rahi thi, tinkon tak kaa istemaal ho rahaa tha, grahamantri rajnath singh kaa bilaspur main raajnneetik kaarykram puraa karnaa vipaksh ke nishane par aana hi tha
 In many border districts of India, there is increasing concern among people about the latest conditions
 unki jaan-maal kii suraksha to ek bada vishay he hi
 In such a situation, the Home Minister and the Prime Minister appearing on the political forums and giving political speeches are also passing on the people
 buudhvaar ko vipakshi dalon kii baithak ke baad jo saajha bayaan saamne aayaa he usamen bhaajapa par yah aarope lagaaya gaya he or kaha gaya he ki bharat sarkaar laapata bhartiya payalat ko pakistan se bharat surakshit waapas laane ke tatkaal prayaas kare
 Although this meeting of the opposition parties was proposed in connection with the minimum common program among the grand alliance partners in view of the Lok Sabha elections, in view of the current situation, the opposition has also made a political move by accusing the ruling party of politicizing the latest situation
 And they will also be seen taking political advantage from it

 The official statement of the Ministry of External Affairs on the whole incident came from India at three in the afternoon but this statement was very brief and many questions remain unanswered
 bhartiya payalat ke pakade jane kii sweekaarokti bhi isamen nahin kii gai thi
 In such a situation, the BJP has once again given the quiet sitting opposition a chance to criticize and the Opposition realizing it has started the work of encircling the Modi government
 pulavama hamale ke javaanon ke shav unke gharon tak pahunchane se pehle hi sattapaksh ke star chehre raajnneetik manchon par nazar aane lage the or badale, aakrosh jaise shabd istemaal kiye ja rahe the
 It was also said that what the previous governments did not do, they have made up their mind to do it, the army has been given complete exemption

 Mamata Banerjee, Trinamool Congress President and Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee also did not miss this opportunity to surround the government
 unhone bhi paristhiti kaa raajnneetik laabh uthaane main koi kasar baaki nahin rakhi
 Questioning the intention of the central government in the pretext of Pulwama attack, Mamata even went on to say that despite the intelligence input from the Modi government that the Pulwama attack took place, the government did not take any action as it wanted to politicize the matter before the election

 On the other hand, the Congress took advantage of the opportunity to surround the Modi government on the pretext of a photo shoot of the Prime Minister

 That is, political party, opposition or BJP, all in their own way wanted to take advantage of this difficult situation

 saath hi jab punjab main captain sarkaar bani to usne tay kiya ki yojana ke tahat nile rang ke nae card nahin jari karne kaa faisla kiya tha

 People bring their families to the hospital in the hope that they will be healed there, but when the hospital itself suffers from a serious disease of disorder? The condition of the trauma center of Gwalior Medical College is similar, where two patients died on 21 October due to lack of basic facilities
 hairaani kii baat he ki aspataal main jagah-jagah janarator lage hai, bas troma centre main nahin he
 In the event of a power failure, two serious patients whose bruises suffered, died due to ventilator shutdown
 kuch maah pehle ek marij kii jaan tab batch pai thi jab uske parijan ventilator ko chaalu rakhane kii khatir inwarter kharid kar laae the
 There are regular power cuts in Gwalior
 21 aktubar ko bhi bijli gul thi, jab troma centre main paanch marij jindagi or maut ke bich jhul rahe the
 Ventilators at the Trauma Center stopped working as soon as the power supply was shut down
 marijon ko tadapata dekh aspataal ke staff ne upies lagaaya, lekin usne bhi aadhe ghante baad kaam karnaa band kar diya
 In the meantime, there was a stir in the hospital
 bijli vibhaag ko phone kar supplai jald se jald behaal karwaai gai, lekin tab tak muraina nivasee chand khan or hastinapur ke sugriv jat kii maut ho chuki thi
 The lives of the remaining three patients could be saved as soon as possible
 ab medical kalege yah bataane main juta he ki jin do marijon kii maut hui he, ve pehle se maranasann haalat main the
 Lack of generator is not the cause of death
 yahaan tak ki chikitsa shiksha mantri anup mishra bhi kehete hai, ''donon hi marij maranasann sthiti main the
 The hospital management is not at all guilty
 vaise ham avyavashtha kii shikaayat kii samiksha kar rahe hai
 a generator is also being installed in the trauma center
 ''yah koi pehali ghatana nahin he, jab troma centre main bijli byaap nahin hone se marijon kii jaan par ban ai ho
 Had the hospital management taken a lesson from a similar incident that took place in May this year, the lives of two people could have survived
 gat 19 may ko troma centre main anil prajapati ko gambhir haalat main bhartee kiya gaya tha
 Then the power went out and the ventilator stopped working
 doctoron ne prajapati ke parijanon se do took kaha ki prajapati kii jaan bachaani he to bijli kaa intjaam karo
 The family immediately went to the market and bought inverters and two batteries
 tab jaakar marij kii jaan batch pai lekin haal main jaan ganvaane vaale marij itane khushnaseeb nahin the
 The reason for not having a generator even after three years in the trauma center started in 2010? Assistant Superintendent of the Hospital, Dr
 camel bhadauria kehete hai, ''troma centre ke bajet main janarator lagane kaa praavdhaan hi nahin tha
 "the deceased asks Chand Khan's son Parvez," Surprisingly, there is not even a generator in such a large hospital
 ''mritak sugriv ke bhai girraj rana aspataal prabandhan ko doshi bataate hue kehete he, ''sugriv kii haalat main sudhaar ho rahaa tha, lekin bijli gaayab hote hi sab kuch khatm ho gaya
 "but Bhadoria refutes these allegations, saying," The ventilators were closed due to the power supply shut down, but this is not the cause of death
 donon marijon kii haalat gambhir thi
 "no action has been taken in this matter at the moment
 haa, do logon kii maut ke baad troma centre main ek chota sa janarator jarur rakh diya gaya he

 australia ke khilaaf bristben test main pehle din kisi vipakshi team ke dwaara 54 saalon main pehali baar bana 300 kaa score he

 a Muslim family, adopting a unique method, has printed a calendar (for the year 2020) as a wedding invitation card for their son, which has a picture of Lord Hanuman
 sirf itnaa hi nahin parivaar ne card par brahma, vishnu, shiv or naarad muni kii tasviir bhi chhapavai he
 Invitation Card Numa On the back of this calendar are information related to marriage

 mubin charera gaanv ke nivasee hai
 He says that he has faith in the Hindu deities along with Allah
 rasulabad ke rajkeey homeopathy aspataal main ward boy ke rup main tainaat mo
 Mubin said that no pressure was put on him to get such a card printed, but he chose the card only with the consent of the family
 unhone kaha, "maine apane sabhi rishtedaaron or doston ko shaadi ke card bheje or unamem se zyaadaatar aashcharyachakit hue, lekin kisi ne aapatti nahin jataai
 This is the first time that a Muslim man has Hindu deities on his wedding card
 yahaan tak ki jin pariwaron main mere bacchon kii shaadi ho rahi he, unhen bhi koi aapatti nahin he
 "mubeen also sent wedding cards to about 700 of his Hindu friends and he also praised his initiative
 kya sarkaar berojgaare ke aankade dabaa rahi he, iske virodh main neshnal statistical kamishan ke kaarywah pramukh pi si mohanan or sadsy je ve minakshi ne istipha diya
 They say that only on 5 December 2018, the data of the National Sample Survey was approved and given to the government, but was not released till date
 is data main kai aisi baaten thim jisase sarkaar ko pareshaani ho sakati thi
 Right now the political issue about unemployment is hot, in such a situation, accusing the government of not releasing unemployment figures is not good for him
 is istife ke baad chaar sadasyon vaale neshnal statistical kamishan main ab do hi sadsy rah gaye hai
 JV Meenakshi is a professor at the Delhi School of Economics and PC Mohanan has been a member of the Indian Statistical Service
 is istife ke baad chif stetician praveen shrivastav or niti ayog ke amitabh kaant hi bache rah gaye hai
 Dilasha, Ishan Bakshi and Somesh Jha of Business Standard have also put the statement of PC Mohanan in their report
 mohanan kaa kahana he ki hamen kai maheenon se lag rahaa tha ki hamen koi gambhirtha se nahin le rahaa he or kinare lagaaya ja rahaa he
 The decisions of the National Statistical Commission were not being implemented
 bijness standard ne likhaa he ki sarkaar en en es o ke nae aankade se sahaj nahin thi
 You will remember that in July last year, this commission had reviewed the GDP figures and said that the GDP 10 in 2010-11 at the time of UPA
 08 percent ho gai thi
 But the government reversed their report
 istife kaa ek kaaran yah bhi bataaya ja rahaa he
 This is the condition of the report to find the unemployment data, then you can guess how reliable the data will be to give allowance to the unemployed or people
 1960 ke dashak se universil basic incum ko lekar prayog chal rahe hai
 An experiment has been going on in Kenya for 12 years
 america kii charity karne vaali sanstha 21000 vayaskon ko har maheene kuch paise detii he or dekhati he ki us paise ke karch yaa nivesh se unke jivan main kya badlaav aayaa he
 From what little study we have done, it has been found that these experiments have not produced very concrete results, on the basis of which we can understand that we can achieve such and such things in the path of this scheme
 iskaa matlab nahin ki isaki pareekshan band ho gaya he balki kisi na kisi rup main kai jagahon par aazamaaya ja rahaa he
 In 2016, the experiment and the idea were rejected in Finland and Switzerland
 usee saal bharat ke aarthik surveykshan main yah idia pravesh karata he magar 2019 ke aate aate ise lekar baat hi hoti he
 But India is the first country in the world where many models of Universal Basic Income have been launched on a large scale
 telugana main raitu bandhu or urisa kaa kaaliya project he
 On January 28, in Raipur, Rahul Gandhi spoke of rising above the state and giving universal basic income scheme at the level of the country
 phir baad main media ne report kiya he ki garibon ke khate main 1500 rupee maheene die jaaenge
 How much will be the burden on the government's budget, whether the old schemes will be closed and the money will be given under this scheme or will they continue to run and another new scheme will be added
 pi chidambaram ne kaha he ki ham apane menifeston main detail denge or is bich aarthik surveykshan main isaki kalpana ko sthaan dene vaale arvind subramanyam or Josh Felman, Boban Paul, M
 R
 Sharan,ne milakar bijness standard main lekh likhaa or apni yojana kaa naam diya QUBRI- QUASI UNIVERSAL BASIC RURAL INCOME
 Rahul Gandhi talks of giving basic income to all the poor
 philhal ke liye ham maan lete hai ki ve shahari garib or gramin garib donon kii baat kar rahe hai
 But Arvind Subramanian and his colleagues clearly talk of giving basic income only to the poor of rural India
 gramin bharat ke 60 se 80 fisadi logon ko iske daayre main laana hoga
 If you are below 60, then the poorest who are poor will be left and if you do more than 80, then the villagers who are rich will also get benefit
 iske liye unki pahchaan kerani hogi jinhen skim se baahar rakhana he
 Farmers with 3 or 4 wheeler farming equipment, credit cart with loan limit of 50,000, government job or non-agricultural business registered with the government, 10 members of any household
 000 se zyada kamata ho, iskar daata ho, 3 se adhik kamaron kaa he or 2
 Have 5 acres of land
 arvind subramanyam ne kaha he ki iske liye ham pehle se maujuud rural socio-economic Caste Census (SECC) kaa istamaal kar aise sampann logon ko chhaant sakate hai or baakiyon ko basic incum de sakate hai
 This is the figure that is used for Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, then basic income can start on this basis
 iske liye 1500 se 1800 rupee prati maah yaa saal main chaar kishton main 18000 rupee die jaaenge
 2 lakh 64 thousand crores will be incurred, which will be shared by the Center and the states half by half
 ab sawaal he ki paisa kahaan se aayega to idia dete hai ki atirikt nunatam samarthan mulya band kar 10,000 karod aa jaaenge
 15,000 crores will come from the closure of interest subsidy on crop loans
 fasal beemaa yojana band kar 11,000 karod rupee aa jaaenge
 The fertilizer subsidy will come to 70,000 in three years
 agar is skim ke liye paisa puraani skim ko band kar laana hoga tab to yah skim kabhi lagu nahin ho sakegi
 Because the decision to discontinue the additional minimum support price, crop insurance and fertilizer subsidy is political and not so easy
 hamen nahin maaloom ki kyon fasal beemaa skim band kar deni chahie
 Will the crop not be destroyed after giving basic income of Rs 1500? jo sampann kisaan baahar kiye gaye hai kya unhen nuksaan ke baad bharpai kii zarurat hi nahin hogi
 Will the rural population pay insurance premium for this 1500 rupees, instead of fertilizer subsidy, they will be able to buy urea at expensive prices? What will happen to the input cast that increases
 em es pi khatm kar nai vyavastha kya hogi, kya kisi sarkaar main saahas he ki em es pi band kar de? arvind subramanyam kii team ke paas basic incum ko lekar idia to he magar paisa kahaan se aayega iskaa thos idia nahin dikhataa he
 In the 2016 survey, he had asked the government for an economic survey, has it happened? isi tarah 7 janvari 2017 ko surajeet es bhalla ne indian express main bhar panna lekh likh diya basic incum par
 He also gave an account
 manaregaa or saarvajanik vitaran pranali se 1
 75 lakh crores of black money is generated
 pradhanmantri kehete hai ko sau fisadi licage band kar di, bhalla sahab ko yah data kahaan se mila
 However, Bhalla Saheb wants that an agreement should be made to discontinue these two schemes and those who survive can be given basic income support
 pehle se chali aa rahi saamaajik suraksha kii yojanaon ko band kar basic incum ke liye paisa jutaney kii baat par arthshaastri zaan dez or ruthika kheda ne apane kai lekh main sawaal uthaae hai
 One, their objection is that when there are so many good studies on the impact of these schemes, how can it be said to base leakages and shut them down
 kya basic incum se in yojanaon ke makasad ko hasil kiya ja saktaa he? ek sawaal is bahes main shaamil sabhi se he
 What we want to get from Basic Income
 ham kheti kaa sankat dur karnaa chaahate hai, gramin bharat kaa sankat dur karnaa chaahate hai yaa saamaajik suraksha kaa nayaa vikalp bananaa chaahate hai
 i am seeing this confusion so i am raising my question
 bharat sarkaar ke aarthik surveykshan 2016-17 ke chapter 9 main basic incum kii kalpana kii gai he
 In it, Arvind Subramanian wrote that 70 percent of the people in India were poor at the time of independence, 22 percent were poor by 2011-12
 70 se 22 percent aane main kai yojanaon kaa haath rahaa hoga
 We have achieved 48 percent poverty without basic income
 ab 22 pratishat se 0 pratishat par aane ke liye basic incum hi kyon zaruri he
 Economist Jan Dej has questioned in an old article that the money being given should be equal to the basic cost of living
 is aadhaar par aap sochie ki kya koi 1500 rupee masik par ji saktaa he? arvind subramanyam kaa kahana he ki 56000 salanaa kamaane vaale parivaar ko uski kamai kaa ek tihaai yani 18000 milanaa chahie jisase uske paas atirikt aarthik kshamta aa jaae
 One question is, are we really building a better social security network
 kya hamen aisa network nahin bananaa chahie jisamen sab surakshit mahasoos karen
 Government employees in Delhi are fasting for their social security at Jantar Mantar
 ye log puraani pension vyavastha kii maang kar rahe hai
 Because even after retiring there will be no money to eat the arm, then how will it work when it is understood, then they are fasting here
 saamaajik suraksha network kii samaj se yaa bahes se pension ko kaise baahar kiya ja saktaa he
 Is the basic income social security scheme or financial assistance scheme under which you are being given some money
 aap kisi se bhi puch len ki kya use nai pension vyavastha main bharosa he, arthshaastri hi bataa den ki nai pension vyavastha se kisne apni pension jeene laayak kar lee he, to phir inke sawaalon kaa kya hoga
 For the past several months, the movement has been gaining momentum over the restoration of the old pension system
 media, jaankaar baat bhale na kar rahe hon magar saadhaaran sarkari karmchaaree apane bhavishya ko lekar asurakshit mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Arvind Subramanian and his group have one more argument
 telugana kaa raitu bandhu sampann kisaanon ko laabh pahunchane vaala he
 In Orissa's Kalia scheme, sharecroppers and agricultural laborers have also been included, but how they will be identified will still have to be seen
 isliye inke model main sirf kheti ko nahin balki gramin ilaake ko rakhaa gaya he

 jab main unke paas pahunchaa to kareeb 55 saal kii umr, darmyana kad
 
 halkaa sharir or dhoop main kaale pad gaye chehre par halki muskaan liye wo mili
 After the death of his wife and son, the tree became his family
 san 2007 ke baad bhaiyaram van vibhaag ke paudhon ko laate or pahari ke aasapaas lagaate
 
 phir do kimi dur se roj tees se chalis mataka pani bharkar laate or paudhon ko sinchate
 As a result of his untiring hard work of 13 years, Bhairam is lost in this, showing the standing forest
 kitaab kaa koi akshar bhale hi wo na pard paaen lekin unke poudharopan kaa paath paryaavaran kii har pustak main shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 If there was someone else, they would have won dozens of prizes by showing a certificate of making trees to the 40 thousand plants given by the forest department, but running the handpumps of the forest department, which was installed six months ago, they say that brother, my God, these trees are there

 19 lakh saplings have been planted in Banda district of Bundelkhand, facing water scarcity
 
 To know what the condition of these plants is, we reached Bahadur Pur near Kalinjar Fort in Banda district
 yahaan 220 hectare ke is jangal main lage paudhe khojane ke liye car se lekar paidal tak se mashkkat karnaa padi
 Due to no boarding and marking of the plantation, the saplings were left in these thickly planted bushes
 kuch lage mili to bahut sari jagah par keval sookhe paudhe dikhe
 As we proceeded in thick bushes, we found traces of planting here in black pages
 ham is jangal main paudharopan hone ke nishaan khoj hi rahe the ki pataa chalaa ki giddiha gaanv main anokhe laal ke ghar main 2016 ke paudharopan kaa board rakhaa he
 In 2016, 2500 saplings were planted and 3000 seeds were planted
 RTI se mili jaankaree main yahaan 5400 ped kaagajon par lage hai or in paudhon kii suraksha ke liye chah sadasyon kii van samiti bhi bani he
 But neither so many plants were seen on the land nor the people of these committees were ever seen by the villagers saving the saplings
 banda se kareeb saath kimi dur mahoba jila he
 This year 14 lakh 60 thousand saplings have been planted here
 upra sarkaar ko ek din main 22 karod paudhe lagane the lihaaja alag-alag 26 vibhaagon ko bhi paudharopan kii jimmedaari saunpi gai
 To reach the plantation of UP Transport Department, we reached the bus stand of Mahoba
 yahaan poudharopan kii photo hone ke baad se hi paudhe nadaarad hai or ab khaali jagah peak daan ke taur par istemaal ho rahi he
 Plantation was done by Forest Minister Dara Singh himself in Gandhi Garden of Mahoba
 uskaa haal jaanane ke liye hamame gandhi upavan kaa rukh kiya
 After asking a lot, he reached this hill outside the city
 yahaan gandhi ji ke pasandida kareeb 6 hajaar paudhe van vibhaag ne lagaae hai
 But it turned out that the big plant planted by the minister is alive, we got many other plants dry
 yahaan gum rahe aawaara maveshi ke chalate jo paudhe bache hai unhen bas khushkismat hi kaha ja saktaa he
 Ashish Sagar, a social activist from Bundelkhand, says that the CAG has also asked for an investigation on the 2010 plantation, but the ground plants have not been investigated for the last ten years
 darasal sarkaar kaa sara jor poudharopan par rahata he kyonki isse netaaon ko prachaar or adhikariyon ko bhrashtachar karne kaa mauka bana rahata he lekin paudha lagane ke bajaae paudha bachaane par jab jor rahegaa tabhi paryaayavaran bhi bachegaa

 In the letter, Kejriwal has counted 5 issues - like advice, decision of council of ministers, who is Delhi government, LG and central government agree on 4 issues like going to file with LG, but LG and central government do not agree on issues like reserved subject

 Which Delhi government does not have authority over
 kyonki 21 may 2015 ke notification main services arakshit vishay ghoshit he or supreme court ne un notification ke bare main kuch nahin kaha he

 "when you have to go opposite the stream, don't take the boat in the middle edge
 kinare-kinare chalaate hai
 The flow in the middle becomes very fast
 " navik ravi sadhu kaa ye sahaj gyaan ham sab apane jivan se khote ja rahe hai
 Which was acquired by human society along the rivers in thousands of years
 28 saal se ganga main naav chalaa rahaa he
 Previously he used to ride a boat with paddle and now with a motor
 ganga main pani bhi kam ho gaya he jiske kaaran bada bada jahaaz nahin chalata, lekin pani se jyaasti (zyada) kamati to log ho gaya dada
 Now people also do not move
 vaise log? haa, dada jyaasti to garib log hota he
 The fare from Dakshineswar to Belur is only ten rupees
 isliye ki chalane vaale garib hai
 Earlier, big people used to walk in Gangaji
 ghat ke kinare nahaane aata tha
 Ravi started listening to the monk and started looking at the ghats on the banks of the Ganges
 nadi ke tir tak utarati sainkadon seedhiyaan or unpar bane darvaaze
 Now they are not in the same condition, but their vastness is telling how many people will come here every day to bathe
 ab ye ghat jarjar avasthaa main hai
 It is important to understand that only the rich have left the Ganges before emotional slogans are being created for their restoration
 chand karmkaandon ko chhod ganga unke jivan style kaa hissaa nahin he
 They are passionate about the Ganges by mixing the cocktail of religion in the nation in their balcony
 khayr in ghaaton par ek yaa do log hi naha rahe hai
 At some ghats, people are carrying water in the box and carrying it like a car
 aadhunik dizinvaale vidyasagar pul se ganga main phenke gaye sikkon ko nikaalane ke liye garib ladakon ne dubkee lagaani chhod di he
 In one end of a long rope, the big round magnets throw the dam far
 jaise hi sikaa chipakata he rassi main halchal hoti he jaise machhlee ke funsate hi bansi jhuk jaati he
 These are the people whose poverty has brought to the Ganges
 belur math or dakshineshwar ke bich ganga kaa paat kaaphi chaudaa he
 Some old temples were seen on both sides of the river, which may have been prosperous but are now shabby
 belur kii said main ek radha krishna mandir he
 The campus is quite grand and the structure of the temple too, but the tone is gone
 dakshineshwar kii said main baarah shiv kaa mandir dikhaa
 Each temple built in the style of Bengal roof (like the roof of a palanquin) is a rarity, but there was no movement
 rang utar gaya he or shaayad bhakton kii wo peedi gaayab ho gai he jo yahaan mannaten maanga karti hogi
 Sailor Ravi Sadhu said that on Shivratri, there is a crowd, but the rest of the time is empty
 belur math or dakshineshwar mandir kii saadagi or bhavyata main koi kami nahin ai he
 It is very crowded due to Saturday and winter
 dakshineshwar se belur kii taraf ravaanaa hote vakt vahaan aae hazaron logon ko nihaarne laga
 Most were in simple clothes and tired of disappointment on the face
 saadiyon kaa rang or chhap bataa rahaa tha ki garib logon ke yahaan abhi faishan kii ekarupata nahin ai he
 Boys' clothes and hair have not been branded
 inaki garibi main hi bhakthi he
 There is so much devotion that people have been standing in Qatar for two hours to see Mother Kali
 dakshineshwar ke ghat par dher sari naaven hai
 These people are going to Belur
 das rupaya kiraaya or ek hi naav main sabake samaa jane kii zid taaki ganga kii yatra kii samuhikta bani rahe
 There is no middle class in these boats
 koi polithin kaa bag sanbhale phisal rahaa he to koi bahut mushkil se ek rupaya kaa sikaa ganga main oochaal rahaa he
 Why is it that the poor are close to natural resources and the rich need a license before going to them
 jamaane baad main bhi naav main ganga kii yatra kar rahaa hum
 The surface of the water is shining with the sunlight like many fish are drying their bodies on the surface
 hawa kii sheetaltaa or nadi kaa chaudaa paat viratata kaa ahsaas karaate hai
 The pleasure of traveling in such an open space is now missing from memories
 ganga main chalanaa ateet main chalane jaisaa laga
 i felt that i was repeating the visits of ancestors
 nadiyon ke kinare kii peediyaan ab sudur maidaanon main ja basii hai
 The houses on the shore also resemble ruins
 ek naav main tees log hi aa sakate hai
 One and a half liter of diesel is consumed in transit
 pump set kii kaali hawa ganga ke liye bhi acchhee nahin hogi
 Suddenly another boat comes next to our boat
 us naav se is naav main ek yatri aa jaataa he
 Sailor's friend
 jaldi donon baaten karne lagate hai
 Ravi Sadhu tells that we only walk in the boat
 sadak bhaati (acchhee) nahin he
 If possible, you should also travel by boat

 The cards that change luck in the hands of illusions, sometimes the things which are disparaged or sometimes made of bad luck, have also been the basis for writing the writings of our films
 dil bahalane, dahalane or fursat ke lamhon main vakt gujaarne kaa acha jariya maane jane vaale taash ke patton ke ird-gird anek aisi filmon kaa kathanak ghumta he jinhone jindagi ke kai anokhe or vidmbanapurna pahaluon ko puddsar dhang se duniya ke saamne rakhaa
 Whether it is famous actor Devanand's film 'gambler', Amitabh Bachchan's superhit film 'the Great Gambler' or Stephan Zwig's novel 'twenty Four Hours in a Women's Life', all because of the playing of cards or around them
 The story of fate becoming worse
 arse puraane dastur ke mutabik film main kisi juaari kaa drishy khinchne ke liye mej par sharaab ke jam ke saath munh main cigarette dabaae abhinayta ko haathon main taash ke pattey liye dikhaaya jaataa he
 Regarding the particular visualization of playing cards in films, film critic Jyoti Venkatesh explains that these cards are naturally seen as essential items in the hands of gamblers
 dhake-chupe dhang se hi sahi lekin is khel ne behad lokapriyata bhi hasil kii he lihaaja filmon main ek juaari ke drushyankan main taash ke patton ko abhinn ang banaaya gaya
 Venkatesh said that in the films based on the life of the gamblers, it was successful to bring out many dark aspects of life through the use of cards
 duniya ke kai deshon main 27 disambar ko ‘playing carrds de’ manaaya jaataa he
 However, concrete information about its history is not available
 venkatesh ne kaha ki vaise to taash ko bahut acchhee najaron se nahin dekha jaataa he lekin sachai yah bhi he ki inamen jivan kaa ek darshan bhi chupa hua he
 If we look closely, the cards also reflect the irony and manipulation of life
 ve ek alag dhang se bataate or jataate hai ki jivan main kisi ko sabakuch nahin miltaa or kismat har kisi par meharbaan nahin hoti
 Referring to the film Twenty Four Hours in a Women's Life, based on Stephen Zwig's novel in 1961, he said that the film, starring Ingrid Bergman and Rip Torn, tried to mend a woman looking for her luck in cards
 She does, but time does not support her
 ek baar uske jahan main yah baat uthati he ki kismat ke pattey uskaa saath nahin de rahe hai
 It is true that the philosophy of playing cards that change the fate of the illusionists and going to the hands of the prophet is a deep connection with the philosophy of cards

 The Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai is one of the unique national parks in the world
 or ab pataa chalaa he ki isamen 35 tendue rahete hai jinhone apana-apana ilaaka baant rakhaa he
 This disclosure came after a survey of about 7 months
 varna ab tak yahi mana jaataa tha ki neshnal park ke jangal main kam se kam 21 tendue hai
 The national park is spread over a total of 104 square kilometers and if the forest of Nagla block and Aarey colony are added to it, then this area becomes 140 square kilometers
 itnaa bada neshnal park shaayad hi duniya ke kisi shahar ke kareeb ho
 According to the director of the park Vikas Gupta, this park is unique in itself
 pakshiyon, jaanwaron or ped paudhon kii saikadon prajatiyon se ata padaa he
 But the park was never surveyed in a large and scientific way
 pehali baar bhartiya vanyajeev santhaan ke saath milakar tendue, unke shikaar or rahane kaa ek niojanabaddh surveykshan kiya gaya
 Apart from the number of leopards, this survey, which ran from December 2014 to June 2015, has also provided many important information
 masalan tenduon ke mel ke adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki usame 57 phisadi junglee jaanwaron kaa avshesh he or 43 phisadi paaltu jaanwaron kaa he jisamen akele kute kaa hissaa 24 phisadi he
 Vikas Gupta also claims that there are a total of 13 species of deer, sambar, chital, monkey and a large number of prey in the jungle, not just leopards
 surveykshan karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale bhartiya vanyajeev santhaan ke vidhyaarthee nikit surve ke mutabik surveykshan ke liye puure park ko 3 bhaagon main vargeekrut kiya gaya or har bhaag main 10 se 15 lokation chunakar vahaan camera trep lagaaye gayi
 The specialty of those censored cameras is that as soon as an animal passes in front of it, it clicks its picture
 tippaniyan After about 5 months of effort, all the photos were matched via computer
 nikit ke mutabik jis taranh har insaan kii ungaliyon kaa nishaan ek jaisaa nahi hota usee tarahan tenduon ke rojet yani sharir par bane dhabbon ke guchchhe kabhi ek jaise nahin hote
 Apart from the 35 leopards roaming free in the national park, 15 other leopards have also been brought from different locations
 unamem se kuch ghayal the to kuch ke narbhakshi hone kaa shaq he
 So all of them are kept in a separate rescue center
 neshnal park kul 104 varg kilometre main failaa he or agar isamen nagala block or aare colony kaa jangal bhi jod diya jaye to ye ilaaka 140 varg kilometre kaa ho jaataa he
 Such a large national park is hardly close to any city in the world
 park ke diarector vikaas gupta ke mutabik ye park apane aap main anokhaa he
 Birds, animals and trees are lined with hundreds of species of plants
 lekin vrihad or vaigyanik tareeke se kabhi park kaa surveykshan nahin hua tha
 a planned survey of leopards, their prey and habitat was conducted for the first time in association with Wildlife Institute of India
 disambar 2014 se june 2015 tak chale is surveykshan se tenduon kii sankhya ke alaava bhi kai mahatvapurn jaankariyaan mili hai
 For example, a study of leopard feces has shown that 57 per cent of it is the remains of wild animals and 43 per cent of domesticated animals, of which the dog alone has 24 per cent
 vikaas gupta kaa ye bhi daawa he ki jangal main sirf tendue hi nahi badi sankhya me hiran, sambar, chital, bandar jaise shikaar hone vaali kul 13 prajatiyaan hai
 According to Nikit Surve, a student of the Wildlife Institute of India, who played an important role in conducting the survey, the entire park was classified into 3 parts for the survey and 10 to 15 locations were selected and camera traps were placed in each part
 sensor vaale un camaron kii khaasiyat he ki jaise hi koi jaanavar uske saamne se gujarata he uski tasviir clic kar letaa he
 The comments takreeban 5 maheene kii mashkkat ke baad sabhi tasveeron kaa computer ke jariye milan kiya gaya
 According to Nikit, the fingerprints of every human being are not the same, in the same way, the rosettes of leopards, or the clusters of spots on the body, are never the same
 neshnal park main aaazaad gum rahe 35 tenduon ke alaavaan 15 duusare tenduon bhi jinhe alag-alag thikaanon se pakad kar laayaa gaya he
 Some of them were injured and some are suspected to be cannibals

 According to the director of the park Vikas Gupta, this park is unique in itself
 pakshiyon, jaanwaron or ped paudhon kii saikadon prajatiyon se ata padaa he
 But the park was never surveyed in a large and scientific way
 pehali baar bhartiya vanyajeev santhaan ke saath milakar tendue, unke shikaar or rahane kaa ek niojanabaddh surveykshan kiya gaya
 Apart from the number of leopards, this survey, which ran from December 2014 to June 2015, has also provided many important information
 masalan tenduon ke mel ke adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki usame 57 phisadi junglee jaanwaron kaa avshesh he or 43 phisadi paaltu jaanwaron kaa he jisamen akele kute kaa hissaa 24 phisadi he
 Vikas Gupta also claims that there are a total of 13 species of deer, sambar, chital, monkey and a large number of prey in the jungle, not just leopards
 surveykshan karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale bhartiya vanyajeev santhaan ke vidhyaarthee nikit surve ke mutabik surveykshan ke liye puure park ko 3 bhaagon main vargeekrut kiya gaya or har bhaag main 10 se 15 lokation chunakar vahaan camera trep lagaaye gayi
 The specialty of those censored cameras is that as soon as an animal passes in front of it, it clicks its picture

 nikit ke mutabik jis taranh har insaan kii ungaliyon kaa nishaan ek jaisaa nahi hota usee tarahan tenduon ke rojet yani sharir par bane dhabbon ke guchchhe kabhi ek jaise nahin hote
 Apart from the 35 leopards roaming free in the national park, 15 other leopards have also been brought from different locations
 unamem se kuch ghayal the to kuch ke narbhakshi hone kaa shaq he
 So all of them are kept in a separate rescue center

 China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said, "china has summoned diplomats from the countries concerned
 ' unhone is bare main zyada jaankaree nahin di
 The comments pichley dinon japan ke shahar hiroshima main ji-7 deshon ke videsh mantriyon ne do-divasiy baithak ke baad ek bayaan main kaha, 'ham purvi or dakshini china sagar main halaat ko lekar chintat hai or ham vivaadon ke shantipurna prabandhan evam samaadhaan ke buniyadi mahatv par jor dete hai

 'US Secretary of State John Kerry and his counterparts from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan issued a statement on the subject of solutions on maritime security after the meeting
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The situation in the last year of Narendra Modi's government has become reminiscent of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government
 india shining yaa bharat udai kaa naaraa yaad aa rahaa he
 At that time it was being publicized that as if India has developed, there is a pleasant feeling or feel good factor all around
 kisi tarah kii kami nahin rah gai he
 Government ministers also became aggressive to justify the government's decision, while such a feeling was confined only to the corridors of power
 kamobesh usee tarah maujuuda bajet ko bahut badhiya bataane main mantri log koi kasar nahin chhod rahe hai
 There is a competition to make the budget better
 isamen jo kuch kami he, vah vipaksh kii vajah se he
 For oil prices to be at the highest level, the minister has been opposing the opposition for not bringing it to GST
 jaise sarkaar ke sabhi kaam to vipaksh se puch kar hi ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, one remembers Amar Singh's statement that the leader's job is to speak and shout
 ghoshnaaon kii jhadi laga di jaati he
 When the Finance Minister announced the world's largest health insurance, he had earlier forgotten the Prime Minister's two announcements related to health insurance and nobody even bothered to know what happened to him
 sarkaar vaise bhi chaah rahi he ki uski kisi yojana ke hashr ke bare main na poocha jaae
 a new and bigger plan is announced before people ask for the results of the old one
 haalanki vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main yojanaon kii jhadi nahin lagaai gai par logon ko bharat udai kii daleelein rijhaa nahin pain
 Even in Vajpayee's time, everyone in the government felt that they were coming back
 pramod mahajan gym main kasarat karte hue bataa rahe the ki sarkaar dobaaraa aegi
 He used to feel that the public has no choice
 isi mugalate kii shikaar modi sarkaar bhi lag rahi he
 And the election results for two seats of parliament and one assembly in Rajasthan are showing this
 rajasthan main hue chunavi rigelt main sabase badi baat jeet kaa antar he jo sarkaar ke liye aaine kaa kaam kar saktaa he agar ve chahen to
 The result of the budget may be seen in the next ten years because the insurance of 10 crore families is good news, but it is strange to announce without making a method of implementation
 lekin ise duniya kii sabase badi swasthya yojana bataanaa kahaan tak uchit he jab duniya jaanati he ki china main keval paanch karod log yaa sirf teen pratishat logon kaa beemaa hona baaki he
 The survivors will be included in this plan by 2020, as per the target
 or haa, bhukh aaj lagi ho or bolen ki chintaa mat kar fasal boi ja rahi he
 The situation of employment is also the same
 vyapaaree varg saamaan desh main banane kii apeksha bichauliye banakar paisa banane main laga he
 If they benefit only by becoming a trader, then why would they want to invest and work hard in future
 aashcharya nahin ki videshi companiyon ke liye bazaar kholane kaa virodh hota he
 There is no news of any big industry coming up
 notebandi se aisa sanket mila jaise desh main paisa rakhana aparaadh ho
 After this, one tax after another is imposed as if those who worship Lakshmi try to bring prosperity to the country, do something wrong
 jo mehnat kar amir banataa he naukariyaan detaa he us par hi sabase zyada tex lagaae jate hai
 Before coming to power, the government which promised to answer Pakistan in its own language, must have been doing so, but its price is very high
 aae din seemaa par golibari main naagarik yaa faujee maare ja rahe hai
 While in opposition, today's foreign minister talked of bringing ten Pakistani heads instead of one
 or grih mantri ne pakistan ko jawaab dete samay goliyon kii ginati bhuulane kii salaah di
 But what came out
 donon taraf hataahaton kii sankhya badhati ja rahi he
 It has become endless now
 gaanvon main shaheedon ke taabut pahunchane kii sankhya bad gai he
 The government now has one more year left and then elections
 sabhi mantri dhire -dhire apane kaam ko sahi sabit karne ke liye jor lagaayenge
 People will ask questions and the government will campaign, people will make noise, the government will now distribute leaflets, will campaign, the voice of the public will be suppressed, but the unlicensed hearth will not allow gold
 achaanak mandir chunaav main aa jayega, dhara 370 khatm kar desh kii sabhi samasya hal kar di jaaegi
 Once again, we will leave the worry of the stove, take the tricolor, declare Bharat Mata ki Jai and go to vote
 jai jai jai

" 'raay kaa kahana he ki unhone apni kitaab main or bhi bahut kuch likhaa he
 This book of opinion is about the tenure of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 purv koyala sachiv pisi
 The books of Parikh, Sanjay Baru, media adviser to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and Natwar Singh, who are close to the nehru-gandhi family, have made similar revelations
 haalanki vinod raay ne un logon kaa naam bataane se inkaar kar diya, jinhone un par logon ke naam hataane ke liye dabaav daalaa tha
 But he said that in his book he has written in detail the circumstances under which he was pressurized and what was said
 purv iees rahe vinod raay ne bataaya ki is kaam ke liye mere sahyogi beurocrats ko bhi mere paas bheja gaya
 Rai said that he felt the most pressure when the Public Account Committee meetings of Parliament were going on
 raay kii kitaab main 15 chapter honge, jisamen unki pradhanmantri manmohan singh or upie ke ahm padaadhikariyon se hui baton kaa bhi zikr hoga

 saaf shabdon main kahen to ye chunaav main bijepi ke liye upi or punjab main hone vaale final mukaable se pehle kaa semifinal muqabla he
 At stake is the charismatic image of the PM in the states of West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and the Union Territory of Puducherry, with little or no impact on national politics
 yahaan ke kshetreey netaa janata main lokapriy hai
 And electoral issues are also different

 Ever since the big victory in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP fought the electoral battle in the elections held in the state, keeping the face of PM Modi ahead and all the states except Delhi, Bihar, got more success than expected, BJP this election PM Modi's face at stake Is living at home kyonki agar in rajyon main behatar parinaam nahin mili to iskaa sidhaa asar uttar pradesh or punjab main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon par padenge
 The big reason for this is that the BJP has not forgotten the crushing defeat of Delhi and Bihar, here too the charismatic image of PM Modi was at stake
 sawaal uthne lage the ki kya ab narendra modi kaa jaadu logon ko prabhavit nahin kar rahaa he? sawaal uthanaa bhi lajimi he, or ab ye paanchon rajyon ke chunaav piem modi ke liye kisi agni-pariksha ke kam nahin he
 That is, not only the BJP at stake, but also the credibility of the PM
 muqabla 'lahar' se nahin, 'janaadhar' segin paanch rajyon main chunaav hone hai, vahaan par bijepi jamini str par behad kamjor he
 The BJP has made its presence known to the people of these states, but only on the strength of it, the electoral journey cannot be overcome
 or phir kisi majboot kshetreey party se bhi gathbandhan ke asaar philhal nahin dikh rahe hai

 yahaan vaise to muqabla tiemasi or vam dalon ke bich he, par bijepi ne mukaable ko trikoniya banane ke liye apni puri takat jhonk di he
 Party president Amit Shah himself is holding the front and is busy in executing the electoral strategy
 mamata ke kila main bijepi kaa nayaa daanvbijepi ne mamata ke khilaaf netaji subhash chandra ke parpote chandra kumaar bose ko maidan main utaara he
 BJP has given a shout that Chandra Kumar Bose will contest against Mamta Banerjee
 mamata bhavanipur seat se emele hai
 Apart from this, the Central Government has announced that 25 secret and files related to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose will be released after the current budget session of Parliament
 isse pehle sarkaar ne janvari maheene main 16,600 pejon kii aitihaasik dastavejon vaali 100 filein jari kii thim
 The central government's reasoning behind this is that people want to know Netaji's life deeply
 lekin isi bahaane bijepi pashchim bengal chunaav main apni maujuudagi darj karwaanaa chaahati he
 Mamta's image is a big challenge, the BJP has been engaged in politicizing its strategy since the Lok Sabha elections, and the target is Mamata Banerjee
 vahiin tiemasi ke kai mantri par sarada scam se lekar duusare bhrashtachar ke aarope lage, kuch ko jail kii hawa bhi khaani padi
 But the image of Mamta herself is impeccable
 maa, maati or maanush kaa naaraa ko mamata ne sarkaar ke dauraan bhi darkinar nahin kiya
 Mamta was criticized for the removal of the Tata Nano plant from Singur, but even after forming the government, Mamata never realized that there was a change in her attitude towards the capitalists and industrialists
 mamata kaa yahi daanv vipakshiyon par baari padataa he or janata ke bich unki lokapriyata bani hui he
 The commonality of Modi and Mamta is only about the interest of the people of West Bengal so that the connection with the people is not broken
 jaise ki gujarat kaa siem rahete hue narendra modi keval 6 karod gujaratiyon kii baat karte the
 By the way, in the last election, Mamata had revealed her political agenda by ousting the Left parties from power
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii baari jeet ke baad se hi mamat apana kila bachaane main jute gayi, unhen pataa tha ki bijepi kaa aglaa nishaanaa pashchim bengal main mamata ko kamjor karnaa hoga
 And its hallmark was seen in a verbal war between BJP and TMC leaders during some communal riots in West Bengal
 bijepi piem modi kaa cheharaa yahaan daanv par lagane se hichak rahi he
 Because the effect of the election result here will affect other states as well
 lekin party ke paas doosraa koi vikalp bhi nahin he
 Opposition is also keen that if the BJP does not put forward PM Modi's face, then it will address the issue that now the magic of Modi is over and the BJP has realized this
 assam main muqabla rocharssom main bijepi thodi jarur sakriy dikh rahi he, yahaan party ne kendriya mantri sarvanand sonoval par daanv lagaaya he
 Also formed an alliance with the Asom Gana Parishad
 is gathbandhan kaa uddeshy congress virdohi maton kaa vibhaajan rokna he
 But inside the BJP, voices are being raised against this alliance
 party ke ek dhade ke netaaon ne is faisle se naaraaz hokar nai party banane kii ghoshnaa kar di he
 And has announced to contest all 26 seats which have been given to the Assam Gana Parishad
 haalanki bijepi ko yahaan apane netritv kii karishmai chhavi se zyada sattarudh congress ke andar machi ghamashan kaa phayda milegaa
 But this is not enough to reach power
 pichley dinon piem modi kii yahaan sabha hui thi
 In which he fiercely attacked the current Congress government and counted his achievements
 vaadon ke sahare hi sahi, par bijepi ne yahaan muqabla rochak bana diya he
 The alliance between the Congress and DMK before the elections in Amma, Emotion and the alliance in Tamil Nadu is a big challenge for the ruling party
 siem jayalalita ko bhi pataa he ki ye gathbandhan unki raah main mushkilen khadi kar saktaa he
 People here are emotionally attached to leaders
 jo bijepi ke paas nahin he
 BJP does not have any face that can turn the wind's position here on its own
 phir yahaan chunavi mudde bhi duusare rajyon ke mukaable bilkul alag hote hai
 The public is promised to give things like sari, TV, mobile
 or satta main aane ke baad use puraa bhi kiya jaataa he
 The Jayalalitha government also prominently implemented the election promises
 sidhe shabdon main kahen to tamilnadu kii raajnneeti tamil muddon ke ird-gird hoti he
 Actor-turned-politician Vijayakanth's party DMDK has also created a thrill by announcing to contest the assembly elections alone
 dmdike 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main endie kaa hissaa thi
 But by announcing to contest the elections alone, the party has given a big blow to the BJP
 bijepi gathbandhan ke bane rahane kii ummid kar rahi thi
 Meanwhile, there is news of relief for the BJP that the meeting here is going to be between AIADMK, dmk-congress alliance, BJP, PDWF and DMDK
 yani vot bantenge to bijepi ko phayda milegaa
 BJP had won one seat in Tamil Nadu in the assembly elections from Tamil Nadu
 saath hi vot fisadi main bhi badhotaree hui thi, lekin ise party kii pakad nahin kah sakate
 The BJP wants to spread its roots here with the policies of the Center
 lekin vahi cheharaa ke abhaav se party baikfoot par aa jaati he
 The Central Government talks about the interest of Tamil, but it has to awaken the faith in the voters
 vaise to yahaan bijepi ke paas khone ke liye kuch nahin he, parantu paane kii chaah main piem modi kaa cheharaa jarur daanv par hai
 Tamil Nadu is a big state and the competition is also big
 kshetreey hisaab se bijepi ke liye yahaan dasha or disha donon kaa abhaav he
 The BJP is powering only on the strength of hope
 aise main piem modi kaa karishmai jaadu jayalalita or karunanidhi ke imotional voters par kya asar karata he ye saaf 19 may ko hi ho paaegaa
 Their flaws, their strength, and in Puducherry also want the BJP to have a presence, in the same order in which the BJP in Kerala recently aligned with a regional party like Bharatiya Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS)
 vahiin oman chandi sarkaar par lage solar scam ko vipaksh chunavi rang dene main vipaksh jute gaya he
 The heat of this scam has also taken the family of Oman Chandy
 loksabhaa chunaav main tiruvanantpuram seat par bijepi ne mukaable ko romaanchak bana diya tha
 The victory was not won but he had definitely registered his presence
 ab bijepi loksabhaa chunaav main rahi kami ko dur karnaa chaahati he
 The party feels that if a little power is applied, its strength can be increased in South India as well
 agar bijepi kaa piem modi par lagaaya daanv yahaan kaam kar gaya to party kii aage kii raah thodi aasaan ho jaaegi
 Also, the charismatic face of PM Modi will further ensure the party's victory in UP and Punjab elections
 lekin in paanchon main agar bijepi ko ummid ke mutabik safalataa nahin mili to ye party or piem modi ke liye aage kaa rasta or chunauteepurn bana degaa

 The indo-tibetan Border Police (indo-tibetan Border Police), the indo-tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and the Border Security Force (BSF), along with the armed border forces and the CISF, celebrating their golden jubilee year, are also the main defense forces of the country
 No invitation has been sent to attend the Republic Day parade to be held at Sal Rajpath

 It is to be known that since 2016, contingents of paramilitary forces under the control of the Ministry of Home Affairs have been included in the parade on rotation basis and that is why some important armed police forces are not included in this parade every year
 Retired personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces are very angry
 purv ardhsainik sanghathan ke mahasachiv ranvir singh ne is babat virodh karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ko patr likhaa he jisamen unhone guzarish kii he ki ganatantr diwas parade ke avasar par sabhi kendriya sashastr balon ko shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 Taking a dig at the Defense Ministry, he said that if this decision is not taken, the retired paramilitary personnel will strongly oppose it by wearing a black band in the protests to be held in New Delhi
 ullekhneey he ki kendriya ardhsainik balon kii lagbhag 1,000 batalians main lagbhag 10,00,000 jawan desh kii simaaon kii suraksha ke atirikt aantarik suraksha or anya kai mahatvapurn suraksha dayitvon kaa nirvaah karte rahe hai, jisase in balon ko pichley lagbhag kuch dashakon main bahut pahchaan mili he or inhen sena ke samakaksh suvidhaayen dene kii maang bhi hoti rahi he
 On this, the defense ministry argues that due to excessive time on Rajpath, the number of contingents is being limited, while the former paramilitary associations say that even if there are four to five additional contingents marching here, barely 2 to 3 minutes
 It will take extra time which will not be a problem to implement, but the paramilitary forces are being deliberately deprived of this parade which is the central ar Represents the half treated with the military forces
 unke anusaar ab samay aa gaya he ki in surakshabalon ko centre sashastr balon kii tarj par pahchaan de or inke karmiyon ko bhi vahi sammaan de jo inke sena ke bhaaiyon ko miltaa rahaa he

 Actor Varun Dhawan tries to do such a film, acting in such a way that Karan Johar will always be proud of him
 abhi varun kii film badlapur aane vaali he
 This is an action film like the films that producer-director Karan Johar does not usually make
 karan kii pahchaan family drama or romantic film kii he, magar varun badlapur film se bhi apane guru karan johar ko prabhavit karne kii koshish main hai
 Varun has also shown his film song to Karan
 varun kaa kahana he ki "maine badlapur kaa 'ji karada' gaanaa unhen dikhaaya
 He has a lot to say
 jab vah aapse milenge khud hi kahenge
 " darasal bhale hi nami nirdeshak david dhawan ke bete hon varun, magar unako filmi duniyaan main launch kiya karan johar ne
 The film "student of the Year" became a hit
 uske baad varun kii duusari hit film "hampti sharma kii dulhaniyaan" bhi karan johar ke production house dharma production se hi mili
 This is the reason why Varun keeps trying that Karan likes his work and his experiment
 varun kehete hai ki "main jaanata hum ki badlapur aisi film he, jaisi film karan nahin banaate
 But, i try to do such a film and work so that he will be proud of me
 " It is clear that even though Varun is one of the successful box office actors of young actors today, Karan's contribution to Varun's success is huge

 17veen loksabhaa ke liye chunavi prakriya shuru ho chuki he or pehle charan kaa matdaan bhi sampann ho chukaa he
 Given the electoral atmosphere prevailing in the country, it becomes very important to know how the performance of the last time the mps who were elected in the Parliament have performed in the House on a personal level
 16veen loksabhaa main kin saansadon kaa pradarshan behad shandaar rahaa or kis saansad ne apane matadaataaon ko niraash kiya
 Even which MP worked hard
 in sab sawaalon kaa jawaab paane ke liye india today group ke data intelligence unit (diaiu) ne ek khaakaa taiyaar kiya or iske aadhaar par pichhali loksabhaa ke saansadon ke vidhaayi kaaryon ke pradarshan kii tulana kii gai
 The performance of each MP was judged on 3 parameters (performance in Parliament, mp's expenditure under MPLADS and public opinion regarding work in the respective parliamentary constituency)
 iske liye india today group ke data intelligence unit (diaiu) ne 543 nirvaachit loksabhaa saansadon main se 416 saansadon ko ranking taiyaar kii
 Here we selected the mps who started their parliamentary term from 18 May 2014
 haalanki is list main kendriya mantri, loksabhaa spikar, dipti spikar or sadan main vipaksh kaa netaa ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he kyonki unhen sadan main upasthiti ko lekar upasthiti panjika par hastakshar nahin karnaa hota he
 In this way complete information about their work can be available in Parliament
 9 sansadeey kshetron main logon kii raay nahin mil saki
 How to prepare your mp's report card: First of all, you have to search your MP or Parliamentary constituency
 agar is suchi main inkaa naam nahin he to aapke saansad ko ranking nahin mili he
 Out of 543 Lok Sabha mps, 416 mps have been ranked, in which information can be obtained
 sansadeey pradarshan ke liye saansadon ke 3 chizon sadan main upasthiti (kul score kaa 25 fisadi), sadan main sawaal poochne kii sankhya (20 fisadi) or sadan main nijee bill pesh karne kii sankhya (15 fisadi) par number die gaye
 However, it is worth noting that asking questions and presenting private bills in the House cannot be considered as the basis of the highest performance of the House
 yah aankada piares legislative research se liya gaya he
 For the evaluation of MPLADS, we looked at the actual expenditure
 yojana ke tahat loksabhaa saansadon ko apane sansadeey kshetron main kalyankari yojanaon par kharch karne ke liye prati varsh 5 karod ke hisaab se 5 saal main 25 karod die jate hai
 In this regard, the expenditure incurred by mps constitutes 30 per cent of the total score
 yahaan yah bhi dhyaan dene vaali baat he ki saansad MPLADS ke tahat kharch ke liye mahaj nirdesh de saktaa he jabaki ise puraa karaane kii jimmedaari jila prashasan kii hoti he
 In this regard, data available on MPLADS website on April 8, 2019 has been taken
 saansadon ke bare main logon kii raay, ol india survey on gavarnence ishyu and voting bihaviour, 2018 par ai report par aadhaarit he
 2 in this survey conducted on a broad scale
 7 lakh logon ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The survey was conducted by the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) in 2018 from the country's parliamentary constituencies
 survey ke jariye 3 jaruri muddon (jaise kii berogari or shuddh peyajal) par sarkaar ke pradarshan ke bare main jaanane kii koshish kii gai
 These issues were different in each parliamentary constituency
 india today ne logon kii raay ke aadhaar par 3 bade mudde uthaane ko lekar saansadon ke pradarshan kaa ausat nikaala jo overol saansadon kii ranking main 10 fisadi mana gaya
 However, the opinion of the voters was based on the performance of the government and not on the performance of the mps
 haalanki isse yah pataa lagane main aasaani rahi ki saansadon ke sansadeey kshetra main sarkaar ke bare main kya raay he
 That is why the lowest number was given by this option to create an overall score
 party ke aadhaar par saansadon ke pradarshan ko lekar india today ne report taiyaar karne ke liye unheen partiyon ko shaamil kiya jiske paas sadan main kam se kam 10 saansad hon
 In this case only 7 parties could be involved in which Shiv Sena got the highest number (A +) while All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and BJP got a grade
 score ko kis tarah se joda gaya1

 The latest case is from a village in Goa, where kissing in public has been banned
 pabandi lagane ke peeche jo tark diya gaya he wo bada mjedaar he
 The ban has been imposed in the picturesque Salvador do Mundo village, located on the seashore, a short distance from Panaji, and the reason for this has been attributed to the irritability of the residents

 " gaanv main sirf chuumane par hi pabandi nahin lagaai gai he, balki sharaab pine or tej aawaaj main sangeet bajaane par bhi pratibandh lagaaya gaya he
 This was compounded by social media posting posters pasted in the village as a declaration of ban

 Gerrard d'souza, who comes from a medical profession, asks, "why kissing? Why is the government putting an end to the expression of love? You can urinate in a public place, but can't kiss? What's the reasoning behind this?" vahiin, gaanv kii hi rahane vaali patrisia najaareth pratibandh kaa samarthan karte hue kahati hai, "log saarvajanik sthal par chuumate hue kuch zyada hi dub jate hai
