 (inputs bhashaa se bhi) Discussion and speculation continues in Bihar regarding RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav
 is bich khabar he ki shuukravaar ko party ke sthapana diwas kaarykram se nadaarad rahane ke baad shanivaar ko tejasvi yadav party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main pahunche or bhaashan bhi diya
 Now the party has announced to contest the upcoming assembly elections under the leadership of Tejashwi
 tejasvi ne media ke sawaalon kaa jawaab bhi diya
 In the Union Budget, he discussed the neglect of Bihar, especially the denial of special state status, and said that in the coming days, Rashtriya Janata Dal will fight to get special state status to Bihar
 iske alaava chamaki bukhaar par bhi unhone mukhyamantri ke jawaab ko pravachan qaraar dete hue kaha ki, 'maine unhen suna or lag rahaa tha ki wo majaboor hai
 However, Tejashwi did not answer those questions as to why he did not go to Muzaffarpur to meet the people affected by the glitter, or why he was absent from the assembly despite being in Patna when the issue was being discussed in the Bihar Legislative Assembly
 shanivaar kii baithak main varisht netaa shivanand tiwari ne bina naam liye tej pratap yadav ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan apana ummidavaar khadaa karne ke mudde ko uthaaya or kaha ki ek ore party kuch logon ke kilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai karti he, to vahiin kuch logon ke prati narmi barti gayi

 vahiin, tejasvi yadav ne apane bhaashan main kaha ki loksabhaa or vidhansabha kaa chunaav alag-alag muddon par hota he
 Hence, there is no need to panic about the assembly elections, but most of the party mlas even after this meeting said that the infighting of Lalu Yadav's family has now become public, which is also reflected in the functioning of the party
 jis prakaar tejasvi yadav ek din gaayab rahete hai or duusare din phir cheharaa dikhaate he, us sthiti main party ke prati unki gambhirtha par sawaal uthanaa laazmi he

 Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Meenakshi Lekhi, told the court that Rahul Gandhi has only regretted his statement, he has not apologized
 jiske baad court ne rahul gandhi ko avmaananaa notice jari kar diya
 However, he is exempted from appearing in the Supreme Court in the contempt case
 rafel deal main gadabadi ke aarope vaali punarvichaar yachika supreme court main sweekaar hone ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki court ne bhi maan liya he ki chaukeedaar chor he
 Rahul made this statement for Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 wo apane bhaashanon main piem modi ko chaukeedaar bataate hue un par chori kaa iljaam lagaate rahe hai
 But the court also accepted that notice was sent to Rahul after objecting to the statement that the watchman is a thief
 jis par rahul gandhi ne supreme court main jawaab daakhil karte hue bataaya ki unhen apane bayaan par afsos he
 However, the BJP was unhappy with Rahul's reply
 bijepi saansad minakshi lekhi ne is sambandh main court main apil kii jis par mangalvaar ko sunwaayee hui
 Advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Lekhi, said that Rahul has not apologized, expressed regret
 is par chif justise ranjan gogoi ne kaha ki abhi tak unhone rahul gandhi kaa jawaab nahin padhaa he
 After this, the CJI told the lawyer of Meenakshi Lekhi that you should read it

 Rahul Gandhi has admitted that he has made a mistake, but Rahul Gandhi has only regretted his statement 'I have not apologized'

 On the other hand, Rahul Gandhi's lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi said in the court that Rahul Gandhi has expressed regret, but this matter is being deliberately raised because Lok Sabha elections are being held
 baharhaal, sunwaayee ke baad court ne rahul gandhi ko avmaananaa notice jari kar diya he
 Also fixed Tuesday (april 30) day for hearing the contempt case
 isi din rafel vivaad par daayar punarvichaar yachika par sunwaayee hogi

 jati kii hinsa ke khilaaf na ham sakht ho sake na dharm kii hinsa ke khilaaf
 But nobody misses politics about violence
 karnataka main ek aisi hi ghatana saamne ai he
 Politics is taking place in Hanover, North Karnataka over the death of Paresh Maista, a young man
 raajnneeti alag he lekin kya police peshewar rup se jaanch se sabit karegi ki hatya kaise hui or doshi koun tha
 Politicians will do politics, they do not see the school hospital for politics, but how is the police doing its work
 paresh maista kii maut kis vajah se hui he police kii taraf se abhi saaf nahin he
 His body was found in a pond in Hannover after 2 days
 bijepi ke netaa kehete hai ki paresh maista unka kaaryakarta tha or uski maut ke peeche kisi muslim sanghathan kaa haath
 Paresh Maesta's father says that his son was not associated with any organization
 paresh ke pita kamalaakar ne kannada main kaha he ki hamaara kisi party yaa sanghathan se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 It is true that we are Hindus but Paresh was not associated with any organization
 bijepi kii saansad ne paresh ko aresas or bijepi kaa kaaryakarta bataaya tha
 BJP MP says that police is pressing the case
 paresh ko koi dalit bataata he to koi kuch
 The fact is that Paresh died
 saamaajik kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki paresh na to dalit he na obisi
 Our colleague Nihal Kidwai has filed two reports on this incident
 congress sarkaar ke grahamantri bijepi par aarope lagaate hai ou bijepi ke netaa congress sarkaar par
 Accusations will continue but on the basis of investigation, it will take years to reach the end

 There were reports of confrontation between the two groups, police and protesters

 The atmosphere became more tense after Paresh's body was found

 paresh kaa shav milte hi soshal media par afvaahon kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 a second picture was put on his photo that it was said that chemicals had been put on his mouth and religious tattoos made on his body had been erased to provoke emotions
 police kaa kahana he yah sab galat he
 Paresh has no chemical marks on his face
 koi bhi tatu mitaayaa nahin gaya he
 Paresh also does not have sharp weapon marks in his face
 police ne soshal media par bhraamak post daale vaale ek teacher ko giraftaar kiya he

 This area has been living under communal tension for two and a half decades
 yahaan ke logon se bhi poochna chahie ki aakhir unhen is sampradayik raajnneeti se miltaa kya, nafrat or hatya ke alaava
 Nihal has quoted an NGO as saying that there have been 300 small and big religious quarrels here
 ab aap yah sochie ki us din kisi bade netaa ke phaltu bayaan par prime time kar detaa or unke jhooth ko sahi galat sabit karne ke liye do bakawaas pravaktaa le aata to kya rahul singh ke maamle main itani bhi karrwai hoti
 Why the RPF answers were not arrested for a year

 Where is the space left in the story of the public who is actually My Father

 Javed Iqbal has written when Gayatri Ram's elder son Santosh told that he grabbed his feet, folded his hands, asked all the neighbors, nobody said anything
 main do dinon se kuch khaaya nahin hum
 Everyone asked what happened but nobody said anything
 kanik ram jis basti main rahete hai vahaan 70 dalit ghar hai, magar us samaaj se bhi koi himmat nahin juta paa rahaa he ki aakar gavaahi de yaa kuch kahe
 Are people of other societies also unable to muster courage? kya jati ke saath sab khadey rahanaa chaahate hai yaa phir unhen police par bharosa nahin he
 Kanik Ram has three sons and a daughter
 do bete batch gaye hai
 a son labors outside and slept on the pond the night of an incident
 kya hatyaron ko apane saamaajik, raajnneetik yaa dharmik aadhaar par itnaa bharosa hota he ki ve system ko manage kar lenge
 Once the investigation is postponed for five years to ten years, then everything is managed
 is ghar main rahane vaala kanik ram urf gayatri ne aakhir kiskaa kya bigaad liya hoga
 20,000 were found under Indira Awas Yojana, half the unfinished house is built
 khidki nahin he, daravaaza tak nahin he
 They must have been dying from their own poverty, why did those who killed them commit such cruelty? hatya ke paanch dinon baat tak farsh par koon bikharaa rahaa
 a blood-stained pillow remained scattered in the corner
 chuulhe par khaanaa pakaa bhi nahin tha, pak rahaa tha jab hatyaron ne hamalaa kiya
 Different arguments are being given
 machhlee mafia kaa kaam bataaya jaataa he
 Kanik Ram Talab used to work on contract
 haal hi main usne kai logon ke saath milakar kisaanon se ek talab yani jalakar kharida tha
 Some say that molestation or love affair is also the reason
 magar dhyaan bhatakaane yaa kisi or masale main lapet dene kii koshish ho rahi he
 Some are giving communal color and some are casteist
 isi tarah ke anek baaten karte karte sara maamla hi gol ho jaataa he
 Dalits have so much power that political parties consider them as vote banks, otherwise no one goes to meet them

 On one hand, three people are brutally murdered in a Dalit colony, but none of the 70 houses in their locality are able to speak, the upper castes of the village do not come in favor of that Dalit, but a Dalit was killed in Tamil Nadu So in protest, only the daughter of the parents who murdered her stood up

 shaadi ke aath maheene baad kaushalya ke pita ne bhaade ke gundon se ve shankar ko marava diya
 Kaushalya's parents are money earners, politically powerful Thevars, they strongly oppose marriage to a Dalit boy

 Everyone should be told about this adventure of Kaushalya
 shankar kii maut hamaare samaaj kaa cheharaa he to kaushalya kaa apane pita ko aaajeevan jail bhijwa dena bhi ek misaal he
 Kaushalya has said that December 12 is a historic day in honor killing cases

 This incident is on 25 November
 california ke kisi college ke baahar goli chal jaati he to aaj kal hamaare angrezi channel sidhaa live karne lagate hai
 Hearing the details of this incident, how bad you must be feeling, i can understand but it is important to tell how many layers of cruelty are there in our society
 bihar ke akhabaaron main is ghatana kii reporting dekh rahaa tha
 It is written that the cause of the incident has not been known
 telegraph, di vir hindi, vir angrezi, prabhaat khabar ke alaava kai akhabaaron main yah khabar chhapi he
 Police officer AK Trivedi has started the investigation, so the police statement regarding the reasons can be awaited
 di vir main javed iqbaal ne likhaa he kibhagalpur main ek hafte ke bheetar do vibhats hatyakand hota he
 The difference in political response to both says a lot about caste politics in Bihar
 bihar ke baahar mukhyadhara kii media main ek dalit parivaar ko kaat die jane kii ghatana kii naam maatr bhi reporting nahin hoti he
 It would have been impossible for the neighbor even if they did not know about the attack, yet no one is talking

 Two kilometers from Jhandapur, a 17-year-old girl is raped and murdered

 javed iqbaal ne likhaa he jab gayatri ram ke bade bete santosh ne bataaya ki pair pakadaa, haath joda, sab padosan ko poocha, koi kuch nahin bolaa
 i have not eaten anything for two days
 sabase poocha ki kya hua magar kisi ne kuch nahin kaha
 There are 70 Dalit houses in the township where Kanik Ram lives, but no one is able to gather courage from that society to come and give testimony or say anything
 kya duusare samaaj ke log bhi himmat nahin juta paa rahe hai
 Do all want to stand with caste or do they not trust the police
 kanik ram ke teen bete hai or ek beti
 Two sons are survived
 ek betaa baahar mazaduri karata he or ek ghatana kii raat talab par soya tha
 Do the killers have such confidence in their social, political or religious grounds that they will manage the system
 ek baar jaanch paanch saal das saal tak talati chali jaae phir to sab manage ho hi jaataa he
 Who would have spoiled Kanik Ram alias Gayatri who lived in this house? indira awaas yojana ke tahat 20,000 mili the, aadha adhuraa ghar bana he
 There is no window, no door
 ye to apni hi garibi se mar rahe honge inhen maarane waalon ne aakhir itani krurta kyon kii
 There was blood on the floor for five days after the murder
 khun se sanaa takiya kone main bikharaa rahaa
 The stove was not even cooking, cooking when the assassins attacked
 alag alag tark die ja rahe hai
 The work of fish mafia is said to be
 kanik ram talab theke par lekar kaam karata tha
 Recently, he along with many people bought a pond from the farmers by burning it
 koi kahata he chhedchhad yaa prem prasang bhi kaaran he
 But there is an attempt to divert attention or to get wrapped up in some other issue
 koi sampradayik rang de rahaa he to koi jativaadee
 While doing many similar things, the whole matter becomes round
 daliton ke paas itani hi satta he ki raajnneetik dal unhen vot bank samaj lete hai varanaa koi unase milane tak nahin jaataa
 Nitish government minister Santosh Nirala went to see the daughter in the hospital
 purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi milane gaye the

 hindu kalege ke professor or dalit adhikaar kaaryakarta ratan laal ne bhi aspataal main jaakar bindu ko dekha tha
 Workers working at the social level have demonstrated about this incident, which usually we do not even value, you do not give, but these people come forward in such times
 beawaz ke liye awaz uthaate hai
 Thousands of people also demonstrated outside the SDM office in Bhagalpur on 6 December
 mukhyamantri ko gyaapan bhi diya gaya he
 50 lakh has been sought
 ek sadsy ko naukari dene kii maang uthi he
 On 27th of November, resistance march took place in front of Ambedkar Murthy at Station Chowk in Bhagalpur
 3 disambar ko bihpur block ke railway stesan par ek din kii bhukh hadtaal hui
 People agreed to raise their voice in democracy, but were the people of Kanik Ram's own community in this crowd, or were there also people from that society who are being told that the killers can be related to them
 patna main bhi ravidaas samaaj ne candal march kiya hoga
 It is expected that the police will also bring concrete evidence in favor of whatever story is revealed
 police ne kanik ram ke donon bete ko suraksha to di he
 There is no end to hatred within our society about religion nor caste, politics understands this, so it keeps pouring ghee in this fire
 ek taraf dalit basti main teen logon kii barbar hatya hoti he magar unke mohalle ke 70 gharon main se koi bolne kii himmat nahin juta paata he, gaanv ke savarna us dalit ke paksh main nahin aa pate hai, lekin tamilnadu main ek dalit kii hatya hui to uske virodh main hatya karaane vaale maa baap kii beti hi khadi ho gai
 Kaushalya did not forgive her parents
 hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ne is maamle ko report kiya he
 s Kaushalya loved and married v Shankar
 kaushalya bhi ejeeniyar hai or 23 saal kaa ve shankar bhi ejeeniyar the
 In July 2015, the two got married to their liking
 ve shankar dalit jati se the
 Eight months after their marriage, Kaushalya's father got v Shankar killed by mercenary goons
 kaushalya ke maa baap paise vaale hai, raajnneetik rup se shaktishaalee thevar samaaj ke hai, unhone dalit ladke se shaadi kaa purazor virodh kiya
 This incident of Tripur was discussed all over the country
 ghatana ke baad kaushalya ne apane maa baap kaa ghar chhod diya
 She started living in Coimbatore with her husband's parents
 ghatana ke baad kaushalya ko sarkari naukari di gai thi
 Police protection was also given
 is ghatana kaa sisitivi footage nahin hota to hatyare shaayad chhot bhi jate
 In March last year, Kaushalya and Shankar went to a market in Tirupur
 hatyaron ne shankar or kaushalya par hamalaa kar diya
 Killed Shankar until he died
 kaushalya bhi buree tarah ghayal ho gai
 It took him several weeks to recover
 thik hone ke baad vah itani tut gai ki khudakushi kaa prayaas kar baithi
 She survived, but after that, her intention to fight is an example in itself
 kaushalya kii daad deni padegi
 It took more than a year, but the decision has come
 thirupur zila adaalat ne is maamle main chah logon ko aaajeevan karawas kii sazaa sunai he
 Three people are acquitted including Kaushalya's mother but Kaushalya is about to appeal against her mother
 kaushalya ke is saahas ke bare main sabko bataaya janaa chahie
 If Shankar's death is the face of our society, then Kaushalya's sending his father to jail for life is also an example
 kaushalya ne kaha he ki 12 disambar kaa din honor kiling maamalon main aitihaasik din he
 Neither we could be strict against caste violence nor against violence of religion
 magar hinsa ko lekar raajnneeti karne se koi nahin chukta he
 a similar incident has come to light in Karnataka
 uttar karnataka ke hanover main ek yuvak paresh maista kii maut ko lekar raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Politics is different, but will the police professionally prove how the murder happened and who was to blame
 netaa to raajnneeti karenge hi unhen skool aspataal ye sab to raajnneeti ke liye dikhataa nahin he magar police apana kaam kaise kar rahi he
 What caused Paresh Maesta's death is not clear from the police
 uski laash hanover main ek talab main mili wo bhi 2 dinon ke baad
 BJP leaders say that Paresh Maista was his activist and the hand of a Muslim organization behind his death
 paresh maista ke pita kehete hai ki unka betaa kisi sanghathan se nahin judaa tha
 Paresh's father Kamalakar has said in Kannada that we have nothing to do with any party or organization
 ye sahi he ki ham hindu hai lekin paresh kisi bhi sanghathan se nahin judaa tha
 The BJP MP had described Paresh as an RSS and BJP worker
 bhaajapa saansad kaa kahana he ki police maamle ko dabaa rahi he
 If someone calls Paresh a Dalit, someone says something
 tathy he ki paresh kii maut hui he
 Social activists say that Paresh is neither a Dalit nor an OBC
 hamaare sahyogi nihaal kidawai ne is ghatana par do report file kii he
 Home minister of Congress government accuses BJP and BJP leaders on Congress government
 aarope lagata rahegaa magar jaanch ke aadhaar par anjaam tak pahunchane main saalon nikal jaaenge
 Politics would have done its work

 There were reports of violence in Sirsi that day

 Many trains were burnt
 aiji police hemanth nimbalkar kii jeep jala di gai
 The police charged the lathi
 paresh kaa shav milane ke baad maahaul or tanaavpurn ho gaya
 The comments nihaal ne apni report main likhaa he ki 2 guton main jhagada hua
 As soon as Paresh's body was found, rumors started circulating on social media
 uski tasviir par duusari tasviir lagaakar bataaya gaya ki munh par rasayan daalaa gaya he or uske sharir par bane dharmik tatu mitaa die gaye hai taaki bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaayaa ja sake
 Police say this is all wrong
 paresh ke chehre par kisi rasayan ke nishaan nahin hai
 No tattoos have been deleted
 paresh ke chehre main dhardaar hathiyaar ke nishaan bhi nahin hai
 Police has arrested a teacher who posted misleading posts on social media
 bengalooru main bijepi kaa ek pratinidhimandal rajyapal se mila he
 They demand that Paresh be killed by the NIA or CBI
 bijepi saansad shobhaa kaarnalje kahati hai ki unhen sthaneey police par bharosa nahin he
 Hanover is the coastal region of Karnataka
 dhai dashakon se yah ilaaka sampradayik tanaav main ji rahaa he
 People here should also ask what they get from this communal politics, apart from hate and murder
 nihaal ne ek gaiyr sarkari aankadon ke hawaale se bataaya he ki yahaan 300 chote bade dharmik jhagade ho chuke hai dange bhi shaamil he isamen

 But nobody misses politics about violence

 Politics is taking place in Hanover, North Karnataka over the death of Paresh Maista, a young man
 raajnneeti alag he lekin kya police peshewar rup se jaanch se sabit karegi ki hatya kaise hui or doshi koun tha
 Politicians will do politics, they do not see the school hospital for politics, but how is the police doing its work
 paresh maista kii maut kis vajah se hui he police kii taraf se abhi saaf nahin he
 His body was found in a pond in Hannover after 2 days

 Paresh Maesta's father says that his son was not associated with any organization

 It is true that we are Hindus but Paresh was not associated with any organization
 bijepi kii saansad ne paresh ko aresas or bijepi kaa kaaryakarta bataaya tha
 BJP MP says that police is pressing the case
 paresh ko koi dalit bataata he to koi kuch
 The fact is that Paresh died
 saamaajik kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki paresh na to dalit he na obisi
 Our colleague Nihal Kidwai has filed two reports on this incident
 congress sarkaar ke grahamantri bijepi par aarope lagaate hai ou bijepi ke netaa congress sarkaar par
 Accusations will continue but on the basis of investigation, it will take years to reach the end
 raajnneeti apana kaam kar chuki hogi
 Paresh went missing since 6 December

 There were reports of confrontation between the two groups, police and protesters

 paresh kaa shav milte hi soshal media par afvaahon kaa daur shuru ho gaya
 a second picture was put on his photo that it was said that chemicals had been put on his mouth and religious tattoos made on his body had been erased to provoke emotions
 police kaa kahana he yah sab galat he
 Paresh has no chemical marks on his face
 koi bhi tatu mitaayaa nahin gaya he
 Paresh also does not have sharp weapon marks in his face
 police ne soshal media par bhraamak post daale vaale ek teacher ko giraftaar kiya he
 a BJP delegation has met the Governor in Bengaluru

 BJP MP Shobha Carnalje says she does not trust the local police
 karnataka kaa tateey ilaaka he hanover
 This area has been living under communal tension for two and a half decades
 yahaan ke logon se bhi poochna chahie ki aakhir unhen is sampradayik raajnneeti se miltaa kya, nafrat or hatya ke alaava
 Nihal has quoted an NGO as saying that there have been 300 small and big religious quarrels here
 bihar ke akhabaaron main is ghatana kii reporting dekh rahaa tha
 It is written that the cause of the incident has not been known
 telegraph, di vir hindi, vir angrezi, prabhaat khabar ke alaava kai akhabaaron main yah khabar chhapi he
 Police officer AK Trivedi has started the investigation, so the police statement regarding the reasons can be awaited
 di vir main javed iqbaal ne likhaa he kibhagalpur main ek hafte ke bheetar do vibhats hatyakand hota he
 The difference in political response to both says a lot about caste politics in Bihar
 bihar ke baahar mukhyadhara kii media main ek dalit parivaar ko kaat die jane kii ghatana kii naam maatr bhi reporting nahin hoti he
 It would have been impossible for the neighbor even if they did not know about the attack, yet no one is talking
 javed iqbaal ne jisase bhi baat kii sabane yahi ki wo vahaan ab nahin rahete hai
 Two kilometers from Jhandapur, a 17-year-old girl is raped and murdered
 savarna jati ke do ladke giraftaar kiye ja chuke hai
 You will get really upset by reading the details of this incident
 javed iqbaal ne likhaa he jab gayatri ram ke bade bete santosh ne bataaya ki pair pakadaa, haath joda, sab padosan ko poocha, koi kuch nahin bolaa
 i have not eaten anything for two days
 sabase poocha ki kya hua magar kisi ne kuch nahin kaha
 There are 70 Dalit houses in the township where Kanik Ram lives, but no one is able to gather courage from that society to come and give testimony or say anything
 kya duusare samaaj ke log bhi himmat nahin juta paa rahe hai
 Do all want to stand with caste or do they not trust the police
 kanik ram ke teen bete hai or ek beti
 Two sons are survived
 ek betaa baahar mazaduri karata he or ek ghatana kii raat talab par soya tha
 Do the killers have such confidence in their social, political or religious grounds that they will manage the system
 ek baar jaanch paanch saal das saal tak talati chali jaae phir to sab manage ho hi jaataa he
 Who would have spoiled Kanik Ram alias Gayatri who lived in this house? indira awaas yojana ke tahat 20,000 mili the, aadha adhuraa ghar bana he
 There is no window, no door
 ye to apni hi garibi se mar rahe honge inhen maarane waalon ne aakhir itani krurta kyon kii
 There was blood on the floor for five days after the murder
 khun se sanaa takiya kone main bikharaa rahaa
 The stove was not even cooking, cooking when the assassins attacked
 alag alag tark die ja rahe hai
 The work of fish mafia is said to be
 kanik ram talab theke par lekar kaam karata tha
 Recently, he along with many people bought a pond from the farmers by burning it
 koi kahata he chhedchhad yaa prem prasang bhi kaaran he
 But there is an attempt to divert attention or to get wrapped up in some other issue
 koi sampradayik rang de rahaa he to koi jativaadee
 While doing many similar things, the whole matter becomes round
 daliton ke paas itani hi satta he ki raajnneetik dal unhen vot bank samaj lete hai varanaa koi unase milane tak nahin jaataa
 Nitish government minister Santosh Nirala went to see the daughter in the hospital

 hindu kalege ke professor or dalit adhikaar kaaryakarta ratan laal ne bhi aspataal main jaakar bindu ko dekha tha
 Workers working at the social level have demonstrated about this incident, which usually we do not even value, you do not give, but these people come forward in such times
 beawaz ke liye awaz uthaate hai
 Thousands of people also demonstrated outside the SDM office in Bhagalpur on 6 December
 mukhyamantri ko gyaapan bhi diya gaya he
 50 lakh has been sought
 ek sadsy ko naukari dene kii maang uthi he
 On 27th of November, resistance march took place in front of Ambedkar Murthy at Station Chowk in Bhagalpur
 3 disambar ko bihpur block ke railway stesan par ek din kii bhukh hadtaal hui
 People agreed to raise their voice in democracy, but were the people of Kanik Ram's own community in this crowd, or were there also people from that society who are being told that the killers can be related to them
 patna main bhi ravidaas samaaj ne candal march kiya hoga
 It is expected that the police will also bring concrete evidence in favor of whatever story is revealed
 police ne kanik ram ke donon bete ko suraksha to di he
 There is no end to hatred within our society about religion nor caste, politics understands this, so it keeps pouring ghee in this fire
 ek taraf dalit basti main teen logon kii barbar hatya hoti he magar unke mohalle ke 70 gharon main se koi bolne kii himmat nahin juta paata he, gaanv ke savarna us dalit ke paksh main nahin aa pate hai, lekin tamilnadu main ek dalit kii hatya hui to uske virodh main hatya karaane vaale maa baap kii beti hi khadi ho gai
 Kaushalya did not forgive her parents
 hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ne is maamle ko report kiya he
 s Kaushalya loved and married v Shankar
 kaushalya bhi ejeeniyar hai or 23 saal kaa ve shankar bhi ejeeniyar the
 In July 2015, the two got married to their liking
 ve shankar dalit jati se the
 Eight months after their marriage, Kaushalya's father got v Shankar killed by mercenary goons
 kaushalya ke maa baap paise vaale hai, raajnneetik rup se shaktishaalee thevar samaaj ke hai, unhone dalit ladke se shaadi kaa purazor virodh kiya
 This incident of Tripur was discussed all over the country
 ghatana ke baad kaushalya ne apane maa baap kaa ghar chhod diya
 She started living in Coimbatore with her husband's parents
 ghatana ke baad kaushalya ko sarkari naukari di gai thi
 Police protection was also given
 is ghatana kaa sisitivi footage nahin hota to hatyare shaayad chhot bhi jate
 In March last year, Kaushalya and Shankar went to a market in Tirupur
 hatyaron ne shankar or kaushalya par hamalaa kar diya
 Killed Shankar until he died
 kaushalya bhi buree tarah ghayal ho gai
 It took him several weeks to recover
 thik hone ke baad vah itani tut gai ki khudakushi kaa prayaas kar baithi
 She survived, but after that, her intention to fight is an example in itself
 kaushalya kii daad deni padegi
 It took more than a year, but the decision has come
 thirupur zila adaalat ne is maamle main chah logon ko aaajeevan karawas kii sazaa sunai he
 Three people are acquitted including Kaushalya's mother but Kaushalya is about to appeal against her mother
 kaushalya ke is saahas ke bare main sabko bataaya janaa chahie
 If Shankar's death is the face of our society, then Kaushalya's sending his father to jail for life is also an example
 kaushalya ne kaha he ki 12 disambar kaa din honor kiling maamalon main aitihaasik din he
 Neither we could be strict against caste violence nor against violence of religion
 magar hinsa ko lekar raajnneeti karne se koi nahin chukta he
 a similar incident has come to light in Karnataka
 uttar karnataka ke hanover main ek yuvak paresh maista kii maut ko lekar raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Politics is different, but will the police professionally prove how the murder happened and who was to blame
 netaa to raajnneeti karenge hi unhen skool aspataal ye sab to raajnneeti ke liye dikhataa nahin he magar police apana kaam kaise kar rahi he
 What caused Paresh Maesta's death is not clear from the police
 uski laash hanover main ek talab main mili wo bhi 2 dinon ke baad
 BJP leaders say that Paresh Maista was his activist and the hand of a Muslim organization behind his death
 paresh maista ke pita kehete hai ki unka betaa kisi sanghathan se nahin judaa tha
 Paresh's father Kamalakar has said in Kannada that we have nothing to do with any party or organization
 ye sahi he ki ham hindu hai lekin paresh kisi bhi sanghathan se nahin judaa tha
 The BJP MP had described Paresh as an RSS and BJP worker
 bhaajapa saansad kaa kahana he ki police maamle ko dabaa rahi he
 If someone calls Paresh a Dalit, someone says something
 tathy he ki paresh kii maut hui he
 Social activists say that Paresh is neither a Dalit nor an OBC
 hamaare sahyogi nihaal kidawai ne is ghatana par do report file kii he
 Home minister of Congress government accuses BJP and BJP leaders on Congress government
 aarope lagata rahegaa magar jaanch ke aadhaar par anjaam tak pahunchane main saalon nikal jaaenge
 Politics would have done its work
 paresh 6 disambar se gaayab ho gaya
 There were reports of violence in Sirsi that day
 police or pradarshnakariyon to kabhi do guton ke bich takaraav kii khabaren thim
 Many trains were burnt
 aiji police hemanth nimbalkar kii jeep jala di gai
 The police charged the lathi
 paresh kaa shav milane ke baad maahaul or tanaavpurn ho gaya
 The comments nihaal ne apni report main likhaa he ki 2 guton main jhagada hua
 As soon as Paresh's body was found, rumors started circulating on social media
 uski tasviir par duusari tasviir lagaakar bataaya gaya ki munh par rasayan daalaa gaya he or uske sharir par bane dharmik tatu mitaa die gaye hai taaki bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaayaa ja sake
 Police say this is all wrong
 paresh ke chehre par kisi rasayan ke nishaan nahin hai
 No tattoos have been deleted
 paresh ke chehre main dhardaar hathiyaar ke nishaan bhi nahin hai
 Police has arrested a teacher who posted misleading posts on social media
 bengalooru main bijepi kaa ek pratinidhimandal rajyapal se mila he
 They demand that Paresh be killed by the NIA or CBI
 bijepi saansad shobhaa kaarnalje kahati hai ki unhen sthaneey police par bharosa nahin he
 Hanover is the coastal region of Karnataka
 dhai dashakon se yah ilaaka sampradayik tanaav main ji rahaa he
 People here should also ask what they get from this communal politics, apart from hate and murder
 nihaal ne ek gaiyr sarkari aankadon ke hawaale se bataaya he ki yahaan 300 chote bade dharmik jhagade ho chuke hai dange bhi shaamil he isamen
 There is not even a nominal reporting of the incident of a Dalit family being cut off in the mainstream media outside Bihar
 padosi ke liye bhi asambhav rahaa hoga ki unhen hamale kii jaankaree na hui ho, phir bhi koi kuch baat nahin kar rahaa he
 Whatever Javed Iqbal talked about, everyone said that he no longer lives there
 jhandapur se do kilometre dur 17 saal kii ek ladki kii balaatkaar ke baad hatya kar di jaati he
 Two upper caste boys have been arrested
 aap is ghatana kaa detail padhakar vaaki pareshaan ho jaaenge
 Javed Iqbal has written when Gayatri Ram's elder son Santosh told that he grabbed his feet, folded his hands, asked all the neighbors, nobody said anything
 main do dinon se kuch khaaya nahin hum
 Everyone asked what happened but nobody said anything
 kanik ram jis basti main rahete hai vahaan 70 dalit ghar hai, magar us samaaj se bhi koi himmat nahin juta paa rahaa he ki aakar gavaahi de yaa kuch kahe
 Are people of other societies also unable to muster courage? kya jati ke saath sab khadey rahanaa chaahate hai yaa phir unhen police par bharosa nahin he
 Kanik Ram has three sons and a daughter
 do bete batch gaye hai
 a son labors outside and slept on the pond the night of an incident
 kya hatyaron ko apane saamaajik, raajnneetik yaa dharmik aadhaar par itnaa bharosa hota he ki ve system ko manage kar lenge
 Once the investigation is postponed for five years to ten years, then everything is managed
 is ghar main rahane vaala kanik ram urf gayatri ne aakhir kiskaa kya bigaad liya hoga
 20,000 were found under Indira Awas Yojana, half the unfinished house is built
 khidki nahin he, daravaaza tak nahin he
 They must have been dying from their own poverty, why did those who killed them commit such cruelty? hatya ke paanch dinon baat tak farsh par koon bikharaa rahaa
 a blood-stained pillow remained scattered in the corner
 chuulhe par khaanaa pakaa bhi nahin tha, pak rahaa tha jab hatyaron ne hamalaa kiya
 Different arguments are being given

 Kanik Ram Talab used to work on contract
 haal hi main usne kai logon ke saath milakar kisaanon se ek talab yani jalakar kharida tha

 Some are giving communal color and some are casteist

 On one hand, three people are brutally murdered in a Dalit colony, but none of the 70 houses in their locality are able to speak, the upper castes of the village do not come in favor of that Dalit, but a Dalit was killed in Tamil Nadu So in protest, only the daughter of the parents who murdered her stood up

 Politics is taking place in Hanover, North Karnataka over the death of Paresh Maista, a young man
 raajnneeti alag he lekin kya police peshewar rup se jaanch se sabit karegi ki hatya kaise hui or doshi koun tha
 Politicians will do politics, they do not see the school hospital for politics, but how is the police doing its work
 paresh maista kii maut kis vajah se hui he police kii taraf se abhi saaf nahin he
 His body was found in a pond in Hannover after 2 days

 Paresh Maesta's father says that his son was not associated with any organization

 BJP MP says that police is pressing the case
 paresh ko koi dalit bataata he to koi kuch
 The fact is that Paresh died

 Our colleague Nihal Kidwai has filed two reports on this incident

 Accusations will continue but on the basis of investigation, it will take years to reach the end

 kaushalya ke maa baap paise vaale hai, raajnneetik rup se shaktishaalee thevar samaaj ke hai, unhone dalit ladke se shaadi kaa purazor virodh kiya
 This incident of Tripur was discussed all over the country
 ghatana ke baad kaushalya ne apane maa baap kaa ghar chhod diya
 She started living in Coimbatore with her husband's parents
 ghatana ke baad kaushalya ko sarkari naukari di gai thi
 Police protection was also given

 In March last year, Kaushalya and Shankar went to a market in Tirupur
 hatyaron ne shankar or kaushalya par hamalaa kar diya
 Killed Shankar until he died
 kaushalya bhi buree tarah ghayal ho gai
 It took him several weeks to recover
 thik hone ke baad vah itani tut gai ki khudakushi kaa prayaas kar baithi
 She survived, but after that, her intention to fight is an example in itself
 kaushalya kii daad deni padegi
 It took more than a year, but the decision has come

 Three people are acquitted including Kaushalya's mother but Kaushalya is about to appeal against her mother
 kaushalya ke is saahas ke bare main sabko bataaya janaa chahie
 If Shankar's death is the face of our society, then Kaushalya's sending his father to jail for life is also an example
 kaushalya ne kaha he ki 12 disambar kaa din honor kiling maamalon main aitihaasik din he
 Neither we could be strict against caste violence nor against violence of religion
 magar hinsa ko lekar raajnneeti karne se koi nahin chukta he
 a similar incident has come to light in Karnataka
 uttar karnataka ke hanover main ek yuvak paresh maista kii maut ko lekar raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Politics is different, but will the police professionally prove how the murder happened and who was to blame
 netaa to raajnneeti karenge hi unhen skool aspataal ye sab to raajnneeti ke liye dikhataa nahin he magar police apana kaam kaise kar rahi he
 What caused Paresh Maesta's death is not clear from the police
 uski laash hanover main ek talab main mili wo bhi 2 dinon ke baad
 BJP leaders say that Paresh Maista was his activist and the hand of a Muslim organization behind his death
 paresh maista ke pita kehete hai ki unka betaa kisi sanghathan se nahin judaa tha
 Paresh's father Kamalakar has said in Kannada that we have nothing to do with any party or organization
 ye sahi he ki ham hindu hai lekin paresh kisi bhi sanghathan se nahin judaa tha
 The BJP MP had described Paresh as an RSS and BJP worker
 bhaajapa saansad kaa kahana he ki police maamle ko dabaa rahi he
 If someone calls Paresh a Dalit, someone says something
 tathy he ki paresh kii maut hui he
 Social activists say that Paresh is neither a Dalit nor an OBC

 paresh kaa shav milane ke baad maahaul or tanaavpurn ho gaya
 The comments nihaal ne apni report main likhaa he ki 2 guton main jhagada hua
 As soon as Paresh's body was found, rumors started circulating on social media
 uski tasviir par duusari tasviir lagaakar bataaya gaya ki munh par rasayan daalaa gaya he or uske sharir par bane dharmik tatu mitaa die gaye hai taaki bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaayaa ja sake
 Police say this is all wrong
 paresh ke chehre par kisi rasayan ke nishaan nahin hai
 No tattoos have been deleted
 paresh ke chehre main dhardaar hathiyaar ke nishaan bhi nahin hai
 Police has arrested a teacher who posted misleading posts on social media

 kaushalya ke maa baap paise vaale hai, raajnneetik rup se shaktishaalee thevar samaaj ke hai, unhone dalit ladke se shaadi kaa purazor virodh kiya
 This incident of Tripur was discussed all over the country
 ghatana ke baad kaushalya ne apane maa baap kaa ghar chhod diya
 She started living in Coimbatore with her husband's parents
 ghatana ke baad kaushalya ko sarkari naukari di gai thi
 Police protection was also given
 is ghatana kaa sisitivi footage nahin hota to hatyare shaayad chhot bhi jate
 In March last year, Kaushalya and Shankar went to a market in Tirupur
 hatyaron ne shankar or kaushalya par hamalaa kar diya
 Killed Shankar until he died
 kaushalya bhi buree tarah ghayal ho gai
 It took him several weeks to recover
 thik hone ke baad vah itani tut gai ki khudakushi kaa prayaas kar baithi
 She survived, but after that, her intention to fight is an example in itself
 kaushalya kii daad deni padegi
 It took more than a year, but the decision has come
 thirupur zila adaalat ne is maamle main chah logon ko aaajeevan karawas kii sazaa sunai he
 Three people are acquitted including Kaushalya's mother but Kaushalya is about to appeal against her mother
 kaushalya ke is saahas ke bare main sabko bataaya janaa chahie
 If Shankar's death is the face of our society, then Kaushalya's sending his father to jail for life is also an example
 kaushalya ne kaha he ki 12 disambar kaa din honor kiling maamalon main aitihaasik din he
 Neither we could be strict against caste violence nor against violence of religion
 magar hinsa ko lekar raajnneeti karne se koi nahin chukta he
 a similar incident has come to light in Karnataka
 uttar karnataka ke hanover main ek yuvak paresh maista kii maut ko lekar raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Politics is different, but will the police professionally prove how the murder happened and who was to blame
 netaa to raajnneeti karenge hi unhen skool aspataal ye sab to raajnneeti ke liye dikhataa nahin he magar police apana kaam kaise kar rahi he
 What caused Paresh Maesta's death is not clear from the police
 uski laash hanover main ek talab main mili wo bhi 2 dinon ke baad
 BJP leaders say that Paresh Maista was his activist and the hand of a Muslim organization behind his death
 paresh maista ke pita kehete hai ki unka betaa kisi sanghathan se nahin judaa tha
 Paresh's father Kamalakar has said in Kannada that we have nothing to do with any party or organization
 ye sahi he ki ham hindu hai lekin paresh kisi bhi sanghathan se nahin judaa tha
 The BJP MP had described Paresh as an RSS and BJP worker
 bhaajapa saansad kaa kahana he ki police maamle ko dabaa rahi he
 If someone calls Paresh a Dalit, someone says something
 tathy he ki paresh kii maut hui he
 Social activists say that Paresh is neither a Dalit nor an OBC
 hamaare sahyogi nihaal kidawai ne is ghatana par do report file kii he
 Home minister of Congress government accuses BJP and BJP leaders on Congress government
 aarope lagata rahegaa magar jaanch ke aadhaar par anjaam tak pahunchane main saalon nikal jaaenge

 As soon as Paresh's body was found, rumors started circulating on social media
 uski tasviir par duusari tasviir lagaakar bataaya gaya ki munh par rasayan daalaa gaya he or uske sharir par bane dharmik tatu mitaa die gaye hai taaki bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaayaa ja sake
 Police say this is all wrong
 paresh ke chehre par kisi rasayan ke nishaan nahin hai
 No tattoos have been deleted
 paresh ke chehre main dhardaar hathiyaar ke nishaan bhi nahin hai
 Police has arrested a teacher who posted misleading posts on social media
 bengalooru main bijepi kaa ek pratinidhimandal rajyapal se mila he
 They demand that Paresh be killed by the NIA or CBI
 bijepi saansad shobhaa kaarnalje kahati hai ki unhen sthaneey police par bharosa nahin he
 Hanover is the coastal region of Karnataka
 dhai dashakon se yah ilaaka sampradayik tanaav main ji rahaa he
 People here should also ask what they get from this communal politics, apart from hate and murder
 nihaal ne ek gaiyr sarkari aankadon ke hawaale se bataaya he ki yahaan 300 chote bade dharmik jhagade ho chuke hai dange bhi shaamil he isamen
 Hindu college professor and Dalit rights activist Ratan Lal had also seen Bindu in the hospital

 Ravidas Samaj may have also carried out a candle march in Patna
 ummid he police jis bhi kahani ko saamne laae, uske paksh main thos saboot bhi laaegi
 Police have given protection to both son of Kanik Ram

 The news is constantly being shown on this, that team Rahul caught this and he left for Punjab and sat in the general bogie of the railway

 Congress's mission was successful
 phir rahul gandhi ne usee tevar main loksabhaa main pradhanmantri ko aade haathon lete hue kaha ki aaj kal wo desh ke daure par hai, unhen kisaanon kaa haal dekhne punjab janaa chahie
 Apparently on that day Rahul called the suit-boot government and today declared the Prime Minister as a non-resident
 bijepi tilamila gai or rahul par waar kiya
 From Venkaiah to Harsimrat Kaur, Rahul replied
 rahul ne ek baar phir corporate gharaanon ko gheraa ki mek in india keval udyogpatiyon se hi hoga? kya isamen kisaanon or mazdooron kaa koi yogadan nahin? Rahul has captured the pulse of recent times, as he knows that the Congress came to power in 2009 by waiving the loans of these farmers and taking care of the laborers in the MNREGA
 ab ek or mauka he maujuuda sarkaar ke bhoomi adhigrahan bill ko paas karaane kii jid kii vajah se sarkaar ke liye yah dharna jarur ban gai he ki jab sab dal iskaa virodh kar rahe hai to sarkaar ise paas karaane ke liye utaavali kyon he? This has made the government uncomfortable that the more the government tries to pass it, the more opportunity Rahul will get
 ab rahul nagpur or vidarbha kaa daura karenge yani nitin gadakari ke garh main, kyonki is sarkaar main bhoomi adhigrahan bill ke sabase bade pairokaar gadakari hi hai
 Taking a pinch on this, Rahul said that Gadkari has rightly said that the farmer should not trust the government and God
 bechaara kisaan kare to kya kare
 It is up to God for irrigation and when God cheats, it is up to the government for compensation
 darasal, chunaav prachaar main bijepi ne logon kii ummiido ko itani hawa de di ki logon ko laga ab sab thik ho jayega

 The question is of power and whoever has the power listens to others
 aage-aage dekhie hota he kya? 2019 bahut dur he, ek nayaa janata parivaar ban rahaa he or seetaram yechuri sipiem ke nae mahasachiv bane hai
 Right now there is a problem in dealing with Rahul, when they also jump in the field, they will enjoy the political game

 ) The Delhi government has filed a petition to modify the November 11 order regarding odd-even of NGT
 dilli sarkaar ne apni yachika main kaha he ki is baar odd-even main mahilaon or tu whilers ko chhot di jaae
 The government argues that because two wheelers are also brought under the purview of odd-even, there will be an additional requirement of about 3500 thousand buses to provide transport facility to 30 to 35 lakh people, which is currently not with the Delhi government
 mahilaon kii suraksha ko bhi philhal taak par nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 So they should not be included in odd-even for now
 dilli sarkaar ne kaha he ki philhal 3 maheene pradooshan badha hua rahegaa or agle 6 maheene main nai bason kii vyavastha kar lee jaaegi
 That means two wheelers can be included in odd-even in November next year
 NGT ne dilli sarkaar kii yachika ko sunwaayee ke liye manjuur karte hue mangalvaar ko sunwaayee ke aadesh die hai
 Whether the Delhi government will get any relief from the court, it will be clear only after the hearing in NGT
 lekin itnaa tay he ki agar NGT ne mahilaon or tu-whealer ko lekar 11 november ko die apane aadesh ko modifai karne se inkaar kar diya to dilli sarkaar ke liye is salchaudd-evenko lagu karnaa tedi kheer sabit ho saktaa he
 The government knows that there are about 60 lakh two wheelers on the roads of Delhi
 agargaudd-evenke dauraan yah sankhya aadhi ho gai to bhi takreeban 35 lakh logon ko transport kii suvidha dene ke liye sarkaar ko atirikt saadhe teen hajaar bason kii jarurat hogi, jo philhal puraa karnaa sarkaar ke boote se baahar he
 In such a situation, the Delhi government is once again under the shelter of the NGT to implement odd-even
 kal hone vaali sunwaayee behad ahm hogi, kyonki agar ye sarkaar ke paksh main jaati he to dilli mendoodd-evenlagu hoga or agar court ne modification ke liye inkaar kar diya to phir sarkaar ise lagu nahin kar paayegi
 But at present, given the increasing level of pollution, it seems that there is no chance of reducing pollution in Delhi without rain
 aise main sarkaar or aam log, donon ko NGT court main mangalvaar ko hone vaali sunwaayee kaa intjaar he
 Shivbhajan Singh of Sikaria village in Jehanabad district owned less than one bigha of land
 makaan jarjar tha phir bhi usne hathiyaaron ko tavajjo di, usne bivi ke gahane bechakar rifl kharidi
 He was not the only person from Bihar's Naxalite affected village to do so
 dhai darjan graminon ne kamjor aarthik haisiyat ke baavjood rifl or bandooken kharidi thi
 The situation in front of the villagers was born out of the bloody struggle between the workers and peasants over the wage dispute
 lekin hathiyaaron ke prati graminon kaa lagaav tab tak dikhaa jab tak graminon main asuraksha kaa bhav tha
 On January 21, 2006, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar started the 'aapka Sarkar Aapke Dwar' program in Sikaria, since then the condition of the village has changed
 uske baad hatya kii ghatnaayen ghati hi nahin
 Sap jawans were deployed in the village but more importantly, plans for overall development were started in the panchayat
 isse mazdooron ke liye rojgaar ke avasar badhane ke saath hi kisaanon ke liye aay ke kai vikalp bhi khul gaye
 Wide roads were built from Kadauna Halt to Sikaria
 gaanv main aadhunik market complex kaa nirmaan hua jisamen panchayat bhawan, atirikt praathmik swasth centre, prashasnic bhawan, gramin bank, kisaan bhawan, vasudha centre, gramin gyaan centre, computer training centre aadi kaa nirmaan karaayaa gaya
 Drains and lanes were developed
 gaanv main primary se inter tak shiksha kii vyavastha kii gai
 Not only this, Sikaria is the first panchayat to have its own website
 yahi nahin, badale kii bhaavana main jeene vaale gramin vikaas kaaryon main dilchaspee dikhaane lage hai
 Women involved in the loss of their loved ones have formed 11 self-help groups
 khaas yah ki rampravesh singh or dharmraj singh kii hatya se khooni daur shuru hua tha, lekin un donon ke beton ne sena main rojgaar hasil kar sikariya ke badlaav kii tasviir pesh kii he
 "the needy villagers will also get financial help for farming, education and employment," says Bala Murgan D, Jehanabad District Magistrate
 ''jab 21 janvari, 2011 ko mukhyamantri dobaaraa sikariya pahunche to unhen gaanv ke badlaav par tajjub hua
 This time the villagers were not worrying about safety like for the first time in front of the Chief Minister, but were focusing on the absence of teachers, expansion of computer center and improvement in power
 darasal, yahaan khooni sangharsh kii kahani us din se shuru hui jab uttar pradesh ke agra ke majdoor netaa dow vinian jepi andolan main bhaag lene bihar aae the

 agle saal dow
 Jung Bahadur Singh, the former block head of Vinian and village formed the Mazdoor Kisan Sangram Samiti
 iske jawaab main kisaanon ne bhoomi sena kaa daaman thama
 The committee then joined hands with Liberation to defeat the Bhumi Sena
 lihaaja, kisaanon or mazdooron ke naam par sanghathanon ke varchasv kii ladaai prarambh ho gai, jiske kaaran madhya bihar main samuhik narsanhaar kii 50 se zyada ghatnaayen ghatin
 In Akvale Sikaria village, 34 people were killed in a systematic manner
 lihaaja, graminon ke samaksh hathiyaar ke sivaa doosraa koi chaara nahin tha
 Later the Naxalites also looted all the weapons of the villagers
 sikariya hi nahin, jahanabad ke sevenn, madevighha, jaamuk, bhavanichak, surangapore panchayaton ko viksit kiya ja rahaa he
 Efforts are on to implement the Sikaria model in 65 panchayats of Patna, Gaya, Jehanabad, Rohtas, Munger, West Champaran, East Champaran and Arwal districts
 sarkaar kii koshish he ki naksal prabhavit ilaakon ke vikaas ke saath graminon kii kshamtaaon main ijapha bhi ho
 The government is trying to work in coordination with DM and SP
 isi samanvay se sikariya desh ke adarsh gaanv ke rup main ubharkar saamne aayaa he
 Conduct DM development work and provide security to officials for implementation of SP schemes
 baharhaal, munger ke dharhara prakhand ke kastyli main naksaliyon ke jariye chah graminon kii hatya or gyaarah logon ko agava karne kii ghatana '80 ke dashak main maamuli kaarnon se sikariya main shuru hui hatya kii ghatnaon kii taaja kadi he
 Therefore, the Secaria model does not end here
 graminon kii jijivishaa ko kaayam rakhana or sikariya kii tarj par naksal prabhavit duusare gaanvon ko vikaas kii patari par laana sarkaar or prashasan ke liye ab bhi sabase badi chunauti he
 SP leader Amar Singh did not trust the Indian doctors
 unhen ab bheed se bhi dar lagata he, isiilie wo phir apni sehat thik karne dilli se dur chale jaaenge
 The government has taken a lot of refusal for them, but they still have no refrain from political condemnation

 There are frequent reports about misuse of money in elections
 matadaataaon ko laalach dene samet or kai tarah se dhanabal ke prayog ke maamle saamne aa chuke hai
 On this issue, when people were asked in our survey, should the Modi government take steps to reduce the use of money power in elections? So in response, different opinions of people came out
 agast 2017 main kiye gaye survey main jab logon se poocha gaya ki kyamodi sarkaarko chunaavon main dhanabal ke prayog ko kam karne kadam uthaane chahie? to 50 fisadi logon ne apni raay haa main rakhi
 At the same time, 29 percent of the people answered no
 21 fisadi log is maamle main koi raay nahin rakhte
 After this, the survey conducted in January 18 did not see much difference in the answer to the same question
 is baar bhi 50 fisadi logon ne sawaal ko lekar sahmati jataai
 But 33 percent of these people did not give their answer
 vahiin, 17 fisadi logon ko maananaa tha ki ve is bare main koi raay nahin rakhte
 On this question, in the survey conducted in August 18, it was revealed that 56 per cent of the people are in favor of taking steps by the government for misuse of money in the election of political parties
 jabaki, 27 fisadi log iske khilaaf the
 At the same time, according to the answer of 17 percent people, they do not have any opinion on the matter
 janvari 2019 main taaja survey main saamne aayaa ki 61 fisadi log chaahate hai ki sarkaar maamle main kadam uthaae
 At the same time, 23 percent people were not in favor of it
 16 fisadi log male par koi raay nahin rakhte hai
 In this way, on the basis of the survey, it can be said that most people want that the Modi government should take steps to improve the funding of political parties to reduce the use of money power in elections

 yah anokhi shaadi pichley hafte hui jahaan kisi prakaar kii chamak damak yaa tamzam nahin tha balki saadagi se yah joda parinay sutara main bandhaa
 When dreamed of marrying the pompous, the dream of his daughter Saraswati was arranged for the marriage of his daughter Saraswati to the son of Munshi Sahni, a resident of his own village, Rajkumar
 har pita kii tarah yogendra saahani ne bhi apni beti kii shaadi ko badi dhoomdhaam se karne kaa man banaaya tha par achaanak notebandi kii vajah se unke saare sapane dhare ke dhare rah gaye
 Desperate due to the closure of the note, when Yogendra Sawhney's problem was revealed to the boy's father Munshi Sawhney, he set a perfect example and advised Yogendra Sawhney not to spend any money on the wedding and that he or his son should do so There will be no problem
 na koi koi vyanjan na len-dein, baratiyon ko mili laddu or chaaytay tithi ke anusaar rajkumaar saahani baraat lekar saraswati ke ghar pahunche or bina kisi tadak-bhadak yaa tamzam ke donon ne shaadi kii
 The special thing is that neither the dishes were served in this wedding, nor the dowry was transacted, but only one cup of tea and laddus were fed to the processors, on which the total expenditure came to Rs 1100
 shaadi main pandit ne nahin pade mantradulhan saraswati ne kaha, 'hamaari shaadi pehle hi tay ho chuki thi magar ain maukey par notebandi kii vajah se pitaaji ko kaaphi samasya ho rahi thi
 We could not postpone the wedding and hence the Baratians were fed only one cup of tea and one laddu
 ' gauratlab he ki rajkumaar or saraswati ke vivaah ko kisi pandit ne sampann nahin karaayaa balki donon ne khud agni ko sakshi maanakar ek-duusare se shaadi kar lee

 On Monday, police arrested three miscreants for trying to throw a petrol bomb at a petrol pump with a bang

 There is both drama and romance in it
 isse hausala bhi badha or yah hakeekat bhi he
 It laughs and cries too
 dhara 377 par 493 prishthon kaa supreme court kaa yah faisla paanch nyaayadhishon kii peeth ne 6 sitambar ko sunaaya
 The language and idiom of this decision are very strong
 sabhi nyaayadhish sahamat the, phir bhi unhone chaar alag-alag faisle likhe or har main samalangikta ko aapraadhikta ke daayre se puri tarah hataane kii jarurat par jor diya gaya tha
 Justice Chandrachud — whose language was the most dramatic — wrote: "there must come a time when the constitutional guarantee of equality and inclusion will end discrimination prevailing over decades
 
 
 vah vakt ab aa gaya he
 "that's right
" media kii zyaadaatar surkhiyaan supreme court ke is faisle kii vaahvahee kar rahi thim or ise desh ko 21veen sadi main le jane vaala bataa rahi thim
 The judgment clearly states that "one hundred and fifty eight years is a long time for the LGBT community to bear the brunt of rejection
" samvidhan ke lagu hone ke baad bhi iske liye 68 varsh lag gaye, yah hamen yaad dilaataa he ki abhi bahut kuch karnaa baaki he
 "of course, this is the truth
 yon abhiruchi ko lekar kisi bhedbhaav ke bina sabhi nagarikon ko samaan adhikaar sunishchit karke desh ko 21veen sadi main le jane ke saahasik prayaas main adaalat ne kai saahitiyik or darshanik hastiyon kaa ullekh kiya he
 The verdict cites a range of thinkers from Shakespeare to Goethe, Aristotle, Kant, and Rawls who have influenced judges' views on the importance of constitutional ethics by rising above narrow communal discrimination
 jo itarlingi logon ke liye maanya he, vahi kanoonee rup se samalingiyon or ubhayalingiyon ke liye bhi maanya hona chahie
 And this constitutional ethics is an attempt to accept diversity in India
 justise chandrachud likhte haih "hamaara samvidhan, "sabase badhkar'' vividhta ko sweekaar karata he
 Its foundation is laid on the vision of building an inclusive society that gives place to many ways of life
 ''lekin upar jin vichaarkon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, unke bare main baariki se gaur karen to do baaten spasht ho jaati hai jo shaayad vividhta ke prati is prashansaneey patibaddhta ke viruddh jaati hai
 First, the philosophers, artists and writers cited in the judgment are almost all men
 duusare, inamen koi bhi bhartiya nahin he
 (some women and some Indian women are also quotations but they are few and hardly quoted directly
 )lekin hamen is asamanta par bhala kyon gaur karnaa chahie? main kahuungi ki hamen nimnlikhit kaaran se is par gaur karnaa chahieh aitihaasik, vilakshan or saahasik hone ke baavjood supreme court kaa faisla mukhya rup se khud ko pashchimi vichaaron main kaid kar letaa he jo ek tarah se nakal maaloom hota he, na ki upniveshi maansikta ko todgaye vaala
 There is no doubt that this thrilling decision followed the principle of diversity, but it is also true that its desire for pluralism is stuffed in the shackles of eccentricity
 is bare main ham thodaa or vichaar karte hai
 There is nothing wrong in mentioning Mill, Wilde, and Shakespeare to give literary, philosophical and historical weight to the verdict
 iskaa shastreey prabhaav yah sanket dene ke liye he ki vishwa ke kai mahaan vichaarkon kii raay bhi isi tarah kii rahi he
 But almost all of these thinkers are associated with the same tradition, then it goes against the idea of diversity
 agar ham "judo-chrishchiyan parampara'' ke path kaa anusaran karen—jaisaa ki faisle main kiya gaya he—to yah kahani kuch is tarah prathit hoti he
 Any relationship beyond marital heterosexuality is questionable and constitutes violence
 bible ke old testament se da book of laviticas, jo 2000 saal se bhi pehle kaa he, main purushon ke saath sambandh banane vaale purushon ke liye durgati ke sabhi tareekon kii vyavastha kii gai he
 In such a tradition, homosexuality has always been covered with clouds of shame and violence for centuries
 lagbhag 200 saal pehle angrej is parampara ko bharat lekar aae
 It is this tradition that is responsible for the declaration of Lord Macaulay's Indian Penal Code in 1860 and which includes Section 377
 isiilie supreme court kii paanch sadasyon kii peeth judo-chrishchiyan parampara se upji kattarta par jor detii he, kyonki british is parampara ko lekar bharat aae the
 Why then did the learned judges look primarily at the same prejudicial tradition in strengthening the argument for independence? You can say that although the judo-christian tradition has historically been against homosexuality, it has taken several major steps in the past few decades in accepting various forms of sexuality
 or yahi vajah he ki supreme court ne usee kaa sahaara liya he
 But what if we look at it a little differently? At the time when the Bible was strongly condemning it, which later came to be called "love which dare not bring on the tongue, almost at the same time the religions of Indian civilizations and In the scriptures, this was accepted as a natural desire
 teesri shatabdi main vatsyayan ke kamasutra main "teesri prakruti'' ke logon kaa spasht ullekh miltaa he, jabaki vishwa ke anya hisson main pehle se hi ise vipathagami bataaya jaataa rahaa he
 In the 18th century, Mir Taki Mir was writing openly on the relationship between men and men, while in Europe people who were incapable of forming heterosexual relationships were being persecuted
 mughal darbaron main hijadon ko ucch pad die jate the
 Even in the Ramayana, he is presented in good form
 angrejon ne samalangikta kii sajaa ke liye rasinic tareeke se badhiya kiye jane kii vyavastha ko jab samaapt kiya tha, usase saat shatabdi pehle 13veen sadi main amir khusro apane pir nizamuddin auliya ke liye kavitaayen likh rahe the
 Chaitanya Mahaprabhu described himself as Radha devoted to Krishna in the 16th century
 jis samay auskar wild ko sajaa sunai gai thi, usase kuch hi samay pehle 19veen sadi main avadh ke nawab nasiruddin haidar har imam ke janmdin par auraton kaa rup dhar lete the
 So, then we can also say about the welcome decision of the previous week that it takes us to the third or 18th century instead of the 21st century
 yahaan yah faisla khud hi bataata he ki aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 The Supreme Court has cited former Australia judge Michael Kirby who describes MSM as men who "have sex with men
" yuan ke halkon main yah aam he
 It refers to physical, sexual activity of men with men
 yah abhivyakti is aadhaar par prayukt hoti he ki bharat samet kuch deshon main kuch purush anya purushon ke saath sex main lipt ho sakate hai
 However, they do not consider themselves gay, or accept a romantic relationship
 
 
 '' duusare shabdon main lagata he bharat ko aisi sabhyataa ke rup main janaa jayega jisamen purushon kaa purushon ke prati aakarshan aitihaasik rup se itnaa vyapak rahaa he ki bahut se logon ne aitihaasik rup se aisa sochaa bhi nahin tha ki yah aapattijanak pahchaan he
 That is, the battle we had been fighting for the last 200 years has been a chapter in our history
 or jab yah faisla kahata he ki "nijee taur par kuch khaas kriyaaon main lipt hone kii ek vyakti kii pasand ko varshon puraani dharna ke aadhaar par apradheekaran ke jariye pratibandhit kiya jaataa rahaa he'' to yah poocha ja saktaa he ki kiski dharna par?hamen is tathy par kyon nahin gaur karnaa chahie ki vishwa ke kisi bhi hisse kii apeksha hamaare desh main sadiyon se vibhinn vividh yon abhiruchiyan kaa samrudh itihaas rahaa he or unhen aparaadh ke taur par nahin dekha jaataa tha
 From this perspective, the landscape of our desire is far more luxurious and full of diversity
 isamen purush, stri, hindu, musalmaan, praachya or paashchaatya sabhi ke liye sthaan he
 This is perhaps a better indication of how rich our history has been regarding sex

 - input bhashaa Australian cricket team coach Mickey Earther believes that Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey still have a lot to offer to the team and hence both will get a chance to play in the first Test match with India from December 26
 
 website 'crik info dot com' ne arthur ke hawaale se likhaa he, "ham is baat par philhal charchaa nahin kar rahe hai ki ponting or hasi ko team se baahar janaa chahie yaa nahin
 In my view, both of them still have the ability to score big
 " "donon ke paas anubhav he or hamen madhyakram main anubhav kii jarurat he
 It is important for us that Ponting and Hussey do justice to our expectations in the Melbourne Test because they are very important players for us
 " isse pehle, purv captain alan border ne kaha tha ki ponting or hasi ko team se baahar hona pad saktaa he
 On the Inside Program of Fox Sports, Border said, "I think one of the experienced batsmen in Ponting or Hussey has to go out

 bihar kaa yah sansadeey kshetra kaaphi prabhaavshaalee mana jaataa he
 The current Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar comes from this region

 unhone algepi pratyaashee satya nand sharma ko haraaya tha
 3,21,982 to Kaushalendra Kumar (34
 93 pratishat) vot mili jabaki satya nand sharma ko 3,12,355 vot
 33 of total votes to Sharma
 88 pratishat hissaa praapt hua
 If you see the difference of defeat, it was less than 10 thousand and the decision of winning and losing on the vote share was less than 1 percent
 2014 ke chunaav main is seat par tisare number par congress rahi jiske pratyaashee ashish ranjan sinha ko 1,27,270 (13
 81 percent) got votes

 The good thing for JDU in this election was that it continued its winning streak in the last election
 2009 ke chunaav main bhi jediu or algepi ke bich takkar rahi
 JDU candidate Kaushalendra Kumar defeated ljp's Satish Kumar
 us saal kaushalendra kumaar ko 2,99,155 vot mili jabaki satish kumaar ko 1,46,478 vot
 There was a big difference in the number of votes and the vote percentage between the two leaders
 kaushalendra kumaar ko 52

 58 pratishat) vot mili
 BSP and Congress stood fourth and fifth respectively

 JDU has been winning the Lok Sabha elections from 1999 to 2014
 is bich 2006 main madhyavadhi chunaav bhi hue jisamen jediu ne hi apana paracham laharaaya
 The reason for this is that this area is considered to be the safe fortress of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar

 Did Congress President Rahul Gandhi in his recent visit to Dubai say that Mahatma Gandhi had taken the idea of non-violence from Islam? Such a claim is being circulated through many Facebook pages
 aise pejon main Nation with namo, PMO India: Report Card or Shankh Naad shaamil hai
 Please tell that Rahul Gandhi was on a tour of United Arab Emirates on 11 and 12 January
 india today fact check ne apni padtaal main is daawey ko bhraamak paaya
 Talking to the Indian community in Dubai, Rahul Gandhi, referring to Mahatma Gandhi, said that for his idea of non-violence, he gave not only Islam but also other religions like Christian and Jewish
 rahul ke bayaan ko islam se jod kar pesh karne vaali poston ko ye story likhe jane tak 11,000 se zyada baar share kiya ja chukaa tha
 In these 9 seconds video of Rahul Gandhi, he can be heard saying - “mahatma Gandhi took the idea of non-violence from ancient Indian philosophy, from Islam
 ” viral video main rahul gandhi ke bhaashan ke agle hisse ko sharartan hataa kar pesh kiya gaya
 Rahul's full speech can be heard in the video available on the Congress Facebook page
 ye video 27 minute or 37 sencond kaa he
 In this, Rahul Gandhi can be heard saying - 'non-violence is associated with our DNA and it has not been linked for 50 years only
 mahatma gandhi ahimsa ke mahaan pratinidhi the
 But Mahatma Gandhiji took the idea of non-violence from our great religions
 pracheen darshanashastra se, islam se, isaiyat se, yahudeevaad se, har mahaan dharm se liya jahaan saaf likhaa he ki hinsa kisi ko bhi kuch bhi hasil karne main madad nahin karegi
 The entire video was also tweeted by the Congress

 com / doedlasoq9— Congress (@incindia) January 11, 2019 So we came to the conclusion that Rahul Gandhi's video was mischievously edited to mislead users and present an incomplete picture
 ateet main bhi rahul ko isi tarah nishaanaa banane kii koshish kii ja chuki he
 In November 2018, a video of the Congress president went viral in which he was targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 us viral video ne bhi adhuri kahani pesh kar internet yugers ko bhramit kiya tha
 That video was also tampered with

 ) pradhanmantri narendra modi ne desh kii aazaadee ke 71wein saal ke maukey par laal kila se kaha ki desh main bhrashtachar ko bakhsha nahin jayega
 Speaking on black money, the Prime Minister said that black money is a big challenge before the country and the central government will not leave any chance to curb it
 baharhaal desh main logon ko ummid thi ki is manch se pradhanmantri modi kaledhan par kisi badi uplabdhi kaa elaan karenge
 Drawing attention to the achievements of the central government, Prime Minister Modi said that while the previous government could not take any decision on the introduction of bankrupt law in the country, his government not only worked to bring this law in the country but also through 3 lakh companies
 Nacel is also tightened so that black money can be stopped in the country and corruption can be curbed
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki unhen viraasat main aisi sarkaar mili thi jo buree tarah bhrashtachar ke changul main fansi thi
 His government has worked to change the atmosphere in Delhi
 yah unke sarkaar kii uplabdhi he ki ab dilli main satta ke galiyaaron main power brokere nahin dekhe jate
 At the same time, on the allegation of nepotism on other political parties, Prime Minister Modi said that during his tenure, brother-in-law nepotism does not get any preference in government work
 piem ne kaha ki unki sarkaar ne beete chaar saal main bade str par sarkari kaamkaaj main paardarshita laane kaa kaam kiya he
 While speaking on the people involved in corruption, the PM said that his government will not forgive those involved in corruption
 pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki unki sarkaar kii koshishon kaa nateeja he ki bite kuch varshon main sarkari yojanaon main se 6 karod se adhik farji labhaarthiyon ko pakadaa gaya he
 Due to these bogus beneficiaries, about Rs 90,000 crore was going into wrong hands from the treasury of the government
 piem modi ne daawa kiya is tarah se bachaae gaye paison kaa istemaal unki sarkaar vikaas kii yojanaon ko chalaane main kar rahi he
 Speaking on the middleman in the agricultural market, PM Modi said that the price of wheat in the market is Rs 24-25
 ise is dar par kharid kar sarkaar 2 rupee main janata ke paas pahunchaati he
 At the same time, rice is available in the market for 30-32 rupees and the government is purchasing this rate at the rate of 3 rupees and reaching the public through ration card
 lekin bichauliyon ke chalate sarkaar kii is vyavastha main mahaj ek kilo genhu or chaaval kii chori karte hue 25 se 32 rupee tak kamaaya ja rahaa tha
 At the same time, the common man had to pay the market price to buy the same wheat and rice
 piem ne daawa kiya ki kendra sarkaar kii is yojana ko puri tarah se chaak chauband kar diya gaya he or lakhon karod rupee kii chori ke raste ko band kar diya gaya he
 However, despite these steps, the Prime Minister in his speech for more than an hour did not touch the aspect of collusion that political agitation has intensified in the country for the past decade

 The Mumbai Police, on the other hand, considers heavy vehicles to be the cause of traffic jams

 However, drivers of four wheelers are happy with the decision of trucking

 The defeat of England in two consecutive Tests on their own soil has not only exposed the shortcomings of the Indian cricket team but has also raised questions on captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's leadership ability and batting form
 england ke khilaaf ab tak bhagya ne bhi dhoni kaa saath nahin diya he
 Under his captaincy, Dhoni has earned the nickname of 'captain Cool' since the team won the 2007 T20 World Cup but his popularity has come down after poor results in Test matches in the last few years
 england ke haathon maujuuda gharelu shrinkhalaa main lagaataar do shikast se rahul dravid or vivies lakshmana jaise madhyakram ke do dhakad ballebaajon ke sanyas ke baad bhartiya ballebaaji kii kamajoriyaan bhi ujagar hui hai
 Sachin Tendulkar's poor form has also increased India's problems while other experienced batsmen have also failed to perform as expected
 dhoni ne aise main saarvajanik taur par aise wicket banane kii maang kar daali jo pehle din se hi spin ke anukool hon lekin unki yah maang bhi ulat pad gai kyonki england kii taiyaari behatar thi
 After defeats in Mumbai and Kolkata, India have no option but to win the fourth and final Test in Nagpur to draw the series
 pichley do saal main haalanki dhoni kaa captain ke rup main ricard acha nahin rahaa he
 India's winning percentage of 33 during this period
 33 rahaa
 Out of the 21 Tests played during this period, India won seven while losing 10 matches
 chaar test dra chute
 The figures are disappointing for the team that topped the ICC Test rankings some time ago
 in saat main se bhi paanch jeet bharat ne gharelu sarajameen par darj kii jisase team kii maujuuda farm kaa pataa chalata he
 Under the leadership of Dhoni on foreign soil, India lost eight matches and won only two
 maujuuda shrinkhalaa main dhoni ne 18
 Has scored at an average of 40 and his best score is 52
 dhoni ne saal 2011 kii shuruyaat se england ke khilaaf kolkata test tak 29
 Has scored 849 runs at an average of 28
 isamen ek shatak or 7 ardhashatak shaamil hai
 In this sense, his place as a wicket-keeper in the team seems safe but his performance as captain has been disappointing
 aise main sawaal yah uthta he ki agar nagpur test main bhi team india ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa to kya selectors unhen agali siries ke liye bhi captain banaaye rakhane kaa jokhim mol lenge

 The debate about 'size Zero' in the Hindi film industry has intensified after Bollywood actress Vidya Balan appeared in a new avatar in the film 'dirty Picture'
 bindaas bayanon or kirdaaron ke liye pahachaani jane vaali film adaakara neha dhoopiya kaa kahana he ki unhone ‘sies jiro’ par kabhi bharosa nahin kiya
 Neha, who arrived in Indore to promote her next film 'pappu Can't Dance Sala', said on the question about Vidya's new avatar, 'I have always been saying that i never trust size zero
 ham jaise hai, hamako vaisaa hi laganaa chaiye
 
 
 But yes, we should be healthy and fit
 ’unhone bollywood ke sadabahaar abhinayta dev anand ke nidhan par gaharaa afsos jataate hue kaha, ‘vah hamaare liye hameshaa se prerana kaa jariya rahe hai

 ’ Announcement of Sahitya Akademi Award 2019: The interesting story behind writing the award in English language to Tharoor Congress leader and former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor has been awarded Sahitya Akademi Award for his book 'an Era of Darkness'
 shashi tharur ko ye khitaab angreji bhashaa kii category main mila he
 This book, written about the British period, was discussed all over the world, because two different versions of this book were printed in India and Britain
 is kitaab ke british varjan kii shuruaati 50 hajaar kapiyaan sirf 6 maheene main bik gai thim
 There is also an anecdote of this book written on the British period, which is mentioned on the official website of Shashi Tharoor
 website ke anusaar, ‘may 2015, jab shashi tharur ko oxford union main ‘britain Owes Reparations to Her Former Colonies’ par bolne ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha, tab unhone kuch aisa bhaashan diya tha jisaki charchaa duniyabar main hui thi
 In July 2015, the video of the debate was tweeted on the social site, which went viral on whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook within a few hours
 ’isamen likhaa he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ke dwaara atend kiye gaye ek kaarykram main loksabhaa spikar ne bhi unke is bhaashan kii tarif kii thi
 When this speech was discussed all around, Shashi Tharoor's friend David Davidar advised him that this speech needed to be elaborated into a book
 bhaashan se kitni alag he tharur kii kitaab?shashi tharur kii website par is kitaab ke bare main likhaa he, ‘ye kitaab puri tarah se britain main die gaye bhaashan par aadhaarit nahin he
 Because that speech was completely one-sided, but because the matter is going on in detail in this book, the sides on both sides have been kept
 ’kitaab main british kaal ke vistaar ke saath-saath bharat main british raaj ke bare main bhi baat kii gai he, jisamen british raaj ke phaaydon ko bhi bataaya gaya he
 After the end of the British Raj, how India progressed is mentioned in some chapters
 Sahitya Akademi Award: british kaal par kitaab ke liye shashi tharur ko sahitya academy awordakitab main kis kaal kaa zikr or kya he khaas?shashi tharur ke dwaara likhi gai is kitaab main saal 1600 se 1947 tak ke itihaas kaa zikr he, jo ki east india company ke bharat main aane se lekar bharat kii azaadi tak kii vistaar se charchaa karata he
 There are a total of 8 chapters in the entire book, in which the entire British period has been talked about in detail
 pehla chapter east india company ke dwaara bharat main machaai gai lut se shuru hota he or british ke khilaaf raajnneetik ekta tak kii baat karata he
 Apart from this, how the decline of the British begins in India and the world, it has also been talked about in the book
 shashi tharur kii is kitaab ko shandaar rivyuu mila tha
 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad has sought answers to many questions from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, referring to the problems being faced by the public through demonetisation
 unhone pradhanmantri se poocha he ki kya 35 dinon main janata kii samasyaon kaa nidaan kar denge? nahin to bataaen ki kitne din or janata ko tadapaayenge? The former Union Minister has issued a press statement in Patna on Thursday, asking a dozen questions from the Prime Minister continuously and said that the public will be waiting for your answers
 lalu ne pradhanmantri se poocha he ki aap vishwa ke sabase bade loktantr ke pradhan sevak hai (jaisaa ki aap har jagah dhindhora peetate hai)
 As a chief servant, how did you take such a big step without thinking about the public and how this Tughlaki decree was imposed on the public? unhone kaha, 'humlog bhi kaale dhan ke sakht virdohi hai, parantu iske naam par aap puunjipatiyon kii god main baithkar aam logon ko pareshaan nahin kar sakate
 Why is the Prime Minister hesitating to catch those who really have black money? ' lalu ne kaha ki ek pakhwaare purv achaanak deshavaasiyon ko yah farmaan sunaaya gaya ki chaar ghante baad desh kii 86 pratishat mudra sirf kaagaj kaa tukdaa rah jaaegi
 This was the Tughlaqi decree, in the form of proverbs, also in emotional and in real terms
 unhone kaha ki jis vyakti ke ek nirnay par karodon logon kaa jivan tikaa ho, kya use bina kuch dekhe, aavesh main aakar, mukhyaprishthon par chaane ke liye anaap-shanaap nirnay lene kaa adhikaar he? The former Union Minister has asked the Prime Minister, 'today the farmer of the country is doing Trihimam
 uski donon fasalein barbaad hone ke kagaar par he
 What did the farmers do to you? What is being avenged from the farmers? ' He said that the country's farmer is poor, but not weak
 desh kaa kisaan modi ko maaf nahin karegaa
 Further, in the tone of question to Modi, Lalu says that what natural pleasure the Prime Minister is getting in tormenting the hungry, poor and deprived of the country? The noise of the commotion that has been created by demonetisation, the noise of crores of hunger and suffering of crores of people is being suppressed, but understand it will not always be buried
 lalu ne kaha, 'pradhanmantri bataaen ki notebandi ke baad epadiai kaa kitna billian dollar desh ke baahar ja chukaa he? is kadam se bhartiya arthvyavastha main avyavashtha kii chhavi vaala jo nakaaratmak sandesh puure vishwa main gaya he, usase ubar paane main kitne pragatisheel saalon kii bali chadhegi?' The RJD leader said that the Prime Minister should tell who is responsible for the rupee's weakness and the worse situation? With this step, how many years will it take to compensate for the dives that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will eat? Will the Prime Minister take responsibility for the fall in growth rate or will the scapegoat be found? lalu ne press bayaan main kaha he ki notebandi ke kaaran abtak 75 se adhik log mar chuke hai
 Who is guilty of his murder? Tell the Prime Minister whether the families of the victims will be compensated or not? The Prime Minister should tell who will compensate the losses suffered by small traders? Who will pay the damages for inconvenience and loss to the people of the unorganized sector? lalu ne piem modi se prashn kiya, 'pradhanmantri ke notebandi ke nirnay main kya mantriparishad kii sahmati thi? agar sachmuch thi, to is nirnay main koun koun log bhagidaar the
 The public wants to know who is responsible for this plight? unhone rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue pradhanmantri se sawaal kiya ki kahin aisa to nahin, sangh ke aadesh par hi yah notebandi kaa swang rachaa gaya? mohan bhagwat chup kyon hai? modi seemaa nirdhaarit karke bataaen ki unke vaadanusaar logon ke khate main 15-15 lakh rupee kab jamaa honge?(hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) purv kendriya mantri ne patna main guuruuvaar ko ek press bayaan jari kar pradhanmantri se lagaataar ek darjan sawaal kiye hai tathaa kaha he ki janata ko aapke javaabon kaa intjaar rahegaa
 Lalu has asked the Prime Minister that you are the chief servant of the world's largest democracy (as you are beating everywhere)
 aapane ek pradhan sevak rahete hue janata ke bare main bina soche kaise itnaa bada kadam uthaa liya or kaise ye tughluqi farmaan janata par thope diya? He said, 'we are also strongly opposed to black money, but in the name of it, you cannot disturb the common people by sitting in the lap of the capitalists
 jinke paas sachmuch kaala dhan he, unako dabochne main pradhanmantri kyon hichkicha, sakuchaa rahe hai?' Lalu said that a fortnight ago, a sudden decree was given to the countrymen that after four hours, 86 percent of the country's currency would remain just a piece of paper
 yah tughluqi farmaan tha, kahawat ke rup main bhi, bhavatmak rup main bhi or vaastavik rup main bhi
 He said that a person whose decision depends on the lives of crores of people, does he have the right to take a decision without any hesitation, in spite of the charge, to swoon over the front pages? purv kendriya mantri ne pradhanmantri se poocha he, 'aaj desh kaa kisaan trahimam kar rahaa he
 Both his crops are on the verge of ruin
 kisaanon ne tumhaara kya bigaada tha? kisaanon se kis baat kaa badla liya ja rahaa he?' unhone kaha ki desh kaa kisaan nirdhan sahi, kintu nirbal nahin he
 The farmer of the country will not forgive Modi
 iske aage modi se sawalia lahaze main lalu kehete hai ki desh ke bhukhe, nirdhan, vanchit ko sataane main pradhanmantri ko koun sa naiysargik sukh praapt ho rahaa he? notebandi se jo hangaamaa khadaa kiya gaya he, uske shor sharabe main karodon logon ke bhukh or pidaa se karaahne kii aawaaj dab rahi he, par samaj lo hameshaa nahin dabegi
 Lalu said, 'PM tell me how many billion dollars of FDI has gone outside the country after demonetisation? With this step, how many progressive years will be sacrificed to recover from the negative message which has been spread all over the world in the image of chaos in the Indian economy? rajd netaa ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ko bataanaa chahie ki rupee kii kamajori or badtar halaat kaa jimmevaar koun he? is kadam se sakal gharelu utpaada (jidipi) dar jo gote khaaegi, uski bharpai main kitne varsh lagenge? vikaas dar main giravat kii jimmevary pradhanmantri legaa yaa bali kaa bakra dhundha jayega? Lalu said in a press statement that so far more than 75 people have died due to demonetisation
 inaki hatya kaa doshi koun he? pradhanmantri bataaen ki peedit pariwaron ko muaavja diya jayega ki nahin? pradhanmantri ko bataanaa chahie ki chote vyapaariyon ko hue nuksaan kii bharpai koun karegaa? asangathit kshetra ke logon ko hui asuvidha or nuksaan kaa harjaana koun bharegaa? Lalu questioned PM Modi, 'was the Council of Ministers' consent in the Prime Minister's decision on demonetisation? If it was true, then who were the people who participated in this decision
 janata jaananaa chaahati he ki uski is durdasha ke liye koun-koun jimmedaar hai?'tippaniyan Taking a dig at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), he questioned the Prime Minister, "is this the case, is this demonetisation done on the orders of the Sangh?" Why is Mohan Bhagwat silent? Modi should set a limit as to when he will get Rs 15 lakh deposited in his account? (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the syndicate feed
 ) Lalu has asked the Prime Minister that you are the chief servant of the world's largest democracy (as you are beating everywhere)
 aapane ek pradhan sevak rahete hue janata ke bare main bina soche kaise itnaa bada kadam uthaa liya or kaise ye tughluqi farmaan janata par thope diya?
