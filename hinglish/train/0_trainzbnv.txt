 BJP president Amit Shah is arriving in Patna on Thursday to save the NDA clan in Bihar
 is dauraan shah jediu adhyaksh va siem nitish kumaar ke saath subah ke naashtaa se lekar ratribhoj tak karenge
 Through this two-mile diplomacy, efforts will be made to remove the bitterness of the relationship between the two parties and to decide a formula for seat sharing in 2019
 bataa den ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi or jediu ke bich siton ke talmail or rajya main koun bada bhai he, in lekar pichley ek maheene se jamkar bayaanbaji ho rahi he
 However, in the JDU National Executive meeting, Nitish Kumar clearly said that the Lok Sabha elections will be contested with the BJP
 iske liye unhone siton kaa formula bhi diya he
 The BJP president is reaching Patna in Bihar on Thursday in such an environment
 ve apni party ke netaaon ke saath-saath jediu adhyaksh va mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke saath din main do baar baithak karenge
 From morning breakfast to dinner, the two leaders will be seen together
 siem nitish kumaar apane nivas par bijepi adhyaksh ke saath ratribhoj karenge
 Interestingly, eight years ago, in June 2010, Nitish had a dinner party for the leaders of bjp's national executive meeting
 bijepi dwaara akhabaaron main chape vigyaapan ke baad nitish kumaar ne is aayojan ko aakhri samay main radd kar diya tha, kyonki vigyaapan main modi-nitish ko ek saath dikhaaya gaya tha
 The relationship between the two parties deteriorated after the JDU move
 2013 main 17 saal puraane gathbandhan ko tod nitish kumaar endie se alag ho gaye the
 However, the two teams have come together again in July last year
 bijepi netaa aaj bhi nitish kumaar ke us kadam ko nahin bhuule hai
 Now that the 2019 election is near and all the parties are busy in winning the mission
 aise samay main nitish or shah ke bich baithak hone ja rahi he
 In such a situation, this meeting between the two leaders is considered very important
 amit shah guuruuvaar subah 10 baje patna ke lokanayak jaiprakash narayan airport pahunchenge, jahaan bihar bijepi ikai ke netaa unka swaagat karenge
 Shah will then proceed directly to the guesthouse, where he will have breakfast with Nitish Kumar and senior party leaders
 shah puure din party kaaryakramon main vyast rahane ke baad raat main nitish kumaar ke awaas par ratribhoj karenge
 It is believed that through the dinner, the two leaders will try to work out a 2019 seat sharing formula that both parties can agree on
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah in dinon rashtravyapee daura kar rahe hai
 During this time, they are trying to help them by having lunch and dinner with the leaders of allies at their residence
 amit shah mumbai main shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare, punjab main akali dal ke pramukh prakaash singh badal or upi ke mirzapur main apana dal kii anupriya patel ke ghar jaakar bhojan kar chuke hai
 
 vishwa cap shuru hone main kuch hi din bache hai, lekin footbal kii deewangi ke liye mashhoor brazil par iskaa surur abhi tak chadhataa nahin dikh rahaa, jo hairaani kaa sabab he
 Brazil will be eyeing a record sixth title, but the Brazilian football enthusiasts, who are usually seen celebrating months before the football season, are silent
 FIFA ne world cap ke liye sabhi 32 tiimon ke logo or naaron kii ghoshnaa keeiskaa kaaran star strikarnemaar kii kharaab sehatya 2014 vishwa cap main team kaa lachar pradarshan ho saktaa he
 According to a survey, 66 percent people have no interest in the upcoming World Cup, while 14
 5 pratishat ko to yah bhi nahin pataa ki toornament kahaan ho rahaa he
 Seraphim Fernandes, a driver in the busy Sara Market here, says, 'there is no excitement this time
 log pareshaan hai 
 'when the World Cup was held in Brazil four years ago, the entire country was painted yellow and green
 sadakon par pile hare rang, imaaraton par rashtradhvaj lahraane kii parampara yahaan varshon puraani he, jo is baar najar nahin aa rahi
 For forty years, it has also been customary to celebrate on the road during the World Cup, which is called 'alajirao', but this time it is not getting sponsors
 is kharaab daur ke bich vah ek acha din tha umr abdulla ke liye
 There was no death by then, and Syed Ali Shah Geelani appealed to keep the peace
 unhone gupakar road sthit apane ghar ji1 ke apane kaamchalaoo daftar main managing editorcaveri bamajise baatcheet kii
 The Chief Minister knows that if he wants to enjoy his rose garden decorated neatly, then more days would be needed
 unase baatcheet kaa anshampichley do maheenon main aapane kya sabak siikhe hai?raajnneetik, prashasnic or nijee morche par kai sabak siikhe
 One of my biggest questions is that the 2008 Amarnath land dispute had a clear source: the allocation of land to build the structure
 lekin is baar saaf taur par koi bhadakaau ghatana nahin thi
 It started with sporadic incidents that had nothing to do with each other
 tufail mattu kii maut aansu gas ke gole kii vajah se hui, jiske baad javed malla or phir rafique bangaru kii maut hui
 But after that Srinagar was pacified
 lekin uske baad sopor main pradarshan shuru ho gaya, vah isliye bhadak gaya kyonki vahaan ek muthbhed main sthaneey ugravadi maaraa gaya tha
 People came out of the house, they targeted the CRPF and fired from the other side and people were killed
 phir chijen anantnag kii ore bad chalin, jahaan koi uksaau ghatana nahin hui thi
 One clear lesson is that we cannot sit silently in Mughalate that there is no issue in Kashmir that needs to be resolved
 bhale hi maahaul shant lag rahaa he lekin agar aap logon ke bich jaaen to unamem gusse or pratishodh kii bhavanaaen dikhengi
 We made the mistake of considering the 2008 assembly election as a sign that there is no problem here
 jammu or kashmir raajnneetik mudda he
 This needs to be resolved politically
 iskaa matlab he swaittata
 
 
 No
 swaittata kaa prastaav meri party ne rakhaa he
 The attitude of other parties is different
 multah iskaa matlab yah he ki mukhyadhara ke saath hi algaavvaadiyon ke saath nirantar raajnneetik samvaad shuru ho
 And how about negotiations with Pakistan? i have always been advocating constant dialogue with Pakistan simply because the separation of people has always been detrimental to the state
 jab parvej musharraf ne atal bihari vaajapeyi or phir dow
 It was good for us if we talked to Manmohan Singh
 hamaare liye sabase kharaab vakt vah rahaa jab hamane kargil, sansad par hamale yaa mumbai main 26 / 11 ke hamale ke baad baatcheet band kar di
 i see it from the narrow view of my state, but national interest is also best served by dialogue
 main baadhaon ko samajhataa hum-pakistan par hukumat ke maamle main yaa unke ravaiye par hamaara koi niyantran nahin he- lekin hamen in baton ko dhyaan main rakhana hoga
 Do you believe that there was a Pakistani hand behind the recent incidents in Kashmir? It would be too early for any kind of blame
 isaki vajah se hamaari pareshaaniyaan or bhi pechida ho jaaengi
 If i start showing my fingers towards the border, people here will start to believe that i am running away from my responsibilities
 kya aapaki dharna or karrwai ke bich koi antar he?main khud hi apana sabase bada dushman hum
 i did not try enough to tell people what we are doing
 ham abhi tak aisi maansikta ke liye taiyaar nahin hai jisamen mehnat hi sab kuch he or ham bhaavana ke bare main baad main chintaa karenge
 But do you believe that what you have done is enough? Much more needs to be done
 aaj rajya main chah lakh berozegaar yuvak hai
 i need to do a lot, and i need their help
 mere yahaan pehle se hi paanch lakh sarkari karmchaaree hai
 On the one hand, while i have to explore many opportunities within the government itself, i also need non-governmental opportunities and for this the situation in the state should be normal
 kya aapako lagata he ki centre ne aapkaa paryaapt samarthan kiya he?mujhe bharat sarkaar, mere gathbandhan ke saajheedaar or upie kaa puraa samarthan hasil he
 It is now my and my colleagues' time to live up to their support and trust
 unhone mujh par usee tarah vishwaas jataayaa he jaise mere rajya ne mujh par vishwaas kiya he
 For this, i am thankful to all those who supported me in this difficult time to come up to their aspirations
 lekin aapako fori taur par kya karne kii jarurat he?halaat saamaanya banane kii jarurat he
 Try to create a situation in which we can relax curfew
 30 july ko phir se pradarshan shuru hone se pehle maine tehsil str kii naagarik baithkon, avami mulaakaat kii vyavastha shuru kar di thi

 But as fast as the methods of protest are changing, is the response of the administration changing as fast as possible? i am leading a security force that has prepared itself to deal with separatism for the last 18 or 19 years
 aaj yah unki koi khaas samasya nahin he
 Now it is a law and order problem
 ab hamen apane siddhant or prakriyaaon ko badalane kii jarurat he
 Let me give you an example
 hamaari bhartiya rigerv police bataliyanon ko ugravad se ladane ke liye vishesh prashikshan diya jane vaala he
 But now we have decided that they will train on the lines of Rapid Action Force so that they can deal with the mob without using deadly weapons

 Why don't you appoint your father as a secret weapon? Because my fathers cannot hide anything from me

 But to go among the people, it is necessary to normalize the situation to an extent
 sarkaar ko unhen sansad se chuttee deni hogi
 Shouldn't the split between the separatists give you an edge? On the contrary, they are playing a positive role in the effort to ensure that no one is killed

 Congress leaders led by MP Sriprakash Jaiswal held a sit-in protest and fasted against the development of Kanpur by the Uttar Pradesh government, while the Bharatiya Janata Party fasted while holding the central government responsible for the rising inflation in the country
 Protests against central government policies and inflation burnt effigies of central government
 ghantaghar chauraahey par kendriya koyala mantri shriprakash jaiswal ne 3 ghante kaa anshan kiya
 At his fast, where a few hundred leaders and workers were present, a few dozen party workers were present under the leadership of MLA Satish Mahana in the bjp's dharna at the big square
 bhaajapa ne is upwas kaa naam ‘sachcha upwas’ rakhaa tha
 At the Yatimkhana crossroads, a few dozen activists, led by Samajwadi Party MLA Irfan Solanki, were also present at the protest demonstration and effigy-throwing program

 Now ask them about why BJP people are protesting against me
 jaiswal ne kaha ki aaj congress kaa dharna or upwas uttar pradesh sarkaar dwaara vikaas kaary na karaaye jane ke virodh main he
 He said that under JNURM, funds were sent through the state government to replace the old sewer line of Kanpur and new sewer line
 iske atirikt siver line badalane ke kaaran khudi sadak ko thik karaane ke liye bhi paisa mila tha
 But the sewer line has been changed by the state government, but most of the city has been carved out of roads
 unhone kaha ki maine rajya sarkaar kaa kai baar dhyaan dilaayaa lekin is disha main koi pragati nahi hui 
 Whereas the Central Government has given all the money to the state government for this
 jaiswal ne kaha ki shahar ke saath saath puure pradesh kii kanoon vyavastha puri tarah se charmara gayi he
 Women are being molested, raped, murdered and other heinous criminal activities are happening every day, but police officers have no time to pay attention to this

 Roads are impaired, sewer line water is flowing on the roads
 or janata traahi traahi kar rahi he
 BJP leaders alleged that the Lok Sabha elections have come to a close, Jaiswal is demonstrating and fasting for his failure to break the head of the state government

 agar unke raajnneetik safar kii baat karen to vah 2004 main pehali baar amethi se saansad bane the or 2009, 2014 main bhi vahaan se saansad bane
 However, this time he faced defeat in Amethi, but he won the election from Wayanad in Kerala and reached Parliament
 amethi main rahul gandhi ko kendriya mantri smriti irani ne maat di he
 The Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, has faced a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections for the second time in a row, in 2019 Rahul was the President of the party while in 2014 he was leading the election campaign
 2014 main congress 44 to vahiin is baar maatr 52 siton par simat gai
 After the results of the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul offered to resign from the post of party president, although the party did not agree to it
 lekin rahul ne congress ko sirf 1 maheene kaa ultimatum diya he, isi bich main unhone nayaa adhyaksh dhundne kii baat kahi he

 The reason? The Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh has been touring continuously for at least six days a week since his public relations program started from Ujjain in the name of Jan Ashirwad Yatra in mid-july
 apane in dauron se unhone bich main bas do hafton kii chuttee lee thi, jab purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa nidhan hua tha
 It has often happened that he returned at 3 o'clock after midnight and left again at 9 o'clock the next morning
 18 ghanton kii yah mashkkat unhen isliye kerani pad rahi he kyonki congress ne unke saamne tagdi chunauti pesh kar di he—itani tagdi ki chouhan maanate hai ki 2003, 2008 or 2013 main aisi chunauti unke saamne pesh nahin ai thi, jab bhaajapa ne teenon vidhansabha chunaav jite the
 The 2018 election is also very important because it will have an impact on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 yah hakeekat kisi kii najar se chhipi nahin he
 What can Chauhan do to defeat the 15-year-old anti-incumbency and put Madhya Pradesh in the BJP fold once again? The distribution of tickets, the rebellion, and the right to share tickets There are three levels of work to do
 chouhan apni yatraaon ke dauraan beshkeemtee feedback ikattha karte hai, vahiin bhaajapa kaa sanghathan raishumaari ke kaam main mubtila he jisamen uske netaa vibhinn jilon main ja rahe hai or party ke ohadedaaron se mashvira kar rahe hai ki adarsh ummidavaar koun ho saktaa he?iske saath-saath sangh or usase jude log bhi apni raay bana rahe hai
 When BJP President Amit Shah came here last time, he spent a lot of time at Samidha, the state headquarters of the RSS
 madhya pradesh ke mahasachiv (sanghathan) suhas bhagat ne bhi 16 aktubar ko isi jagah kshetra prachaarak deepak vispute ke saath lambii baithak kii or ummidavaaron ke bare main sangh kaa feedback liya
 Once the candidates are finalized, the Sangh will put the full strength of its NGO network and other leading organizations behind those candidates and mobilize votes in each constituency
 yah lamabandi kitni kaamyaab hoti he, yah to khayr vakt hi batayega
 The reason for this is that Sangh workers are upset that work at the grassroots level takes place only after "transactions"
 kaiyon ko lagata he ki "shanti kaal'' main to mukhyamantri chuninda afasarshahon ke jariye kaam karnaa pasand karte hai or keval "yuddh'' (yani chunaav) ke dauraan hi sangh kaa rukh karte hai
 This is also the first time an umbrella organization of voluntary factions - Jan Abhiyan Parishad - works with the state government and currently has a gathering of RSS members
 yah systemic voters ajukeshan and elactoral participeshan (esaviiipi yaa sweep) naam se ek kaarykram chalaa rahaa he
 The purpose of this program, which is being run on the orders of the Election Commission, is to increase the percentage of voting, however it is helping the Sangh to contact the voters directly
 yah bhi pehali baar hua he jab jameen kii sateek report hasil karne ke liye zyaadaatar rajya se baahar kii agenciyon ko kam se kam 10 survey karne kaa kaam saunpa gaya he
 The names of the candidates will be decided on the basis of their opinion and results and before that it will be ascertained whether their caste equations are suitable not only in that constituency but also in the surrounding constituencies
 beshak in surveykshanon kii sateekta andeh ke ghere main he, khaskar tab jab surveykshan ke form tikat ke daavedaar bhaajapa netaaon ke haath main dekhe gaye hai
 In some cases, these leaders filled these forms on their own to bolster their claims
 bade str par dekhen to bhaajapa "meraa booth sabase majboot'' tareeke se aage bad rahi he
 The idea behind this is that every booth should be won so that the constituency can be won
 sthaneey satta virdohi bhaavana par kaabo paane ke liye kam se kam 60 maujuuda vidhayakon ke tikat kaate ja sakate hai jinamein kuch mantri bhi hai
 How will the party deal with the discontent arising out of it? a source says, "the party has already started talking to the mlas
 jinke tikat kaate jaaenge, unhen bataa diya jayega ki kai surveykshanon main unki haar kii bhavishyavaanee kii gai thi
 He will be promised to be the chairperson of state government companies or boards
 '' aise netaaon ke rishtedaaron ko tikat dene yaa unhen aasapaas ke nirvachan kshetron se chunaav ladvane kii sambhaavna par bhi vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 It is expected that as a cadre-based party, the BJP rebellion will be able to better deal with the Congress
 nae voton ko khinchne kii jugatchauhan ke kheme main ab tak hui aankadon kii jugalee se pataa chalaa he ki bhaajapa ke maujuuda vot jeet ke liye kaaphi nahin bhi ho sakate hai
 Difference between BJP and Congress votes in 2013 8
 4 fisadi tha
 Congress only 4
 2 fisadi kaa phayda use bhaajapa kii barabari par laa khadaa karegaa
 This is why 2 in the vote share
 3 fisadi ke ijaphe kaa mansuba banaaya ja rahaa he
 These votes can come from professionals who are not necessarily BJP voters, but can vote in favor of Chauhan
 nateeja yah ki chouhan doctoron, vakeelon, patrakaron, sena ke afasaron or ritair naukarshahon kii duhai de rahe hai, is ummid se ki na keval ve khud unke paksh main vot denge balki apane jaanane waalon ke vot bhi dilavaayenge

 The government has still deferred the decision on reservation in promotions, despite the ongoing movement on caste, even though the Supreme Court allowed it in September itself
 yahi vah mudda he jiskaa savarna or pichde virgon ke log virodh kar rahe the
 They are also opposing the amendment made in August in the SC / ST (prevention of Atrocities) Act
 bhaajapa ko lagata he ki is mudde par abhi faisla nahin lenaa hi sabase acha hoga
 They are also hoping that the movement of upper castes and backward classes has seen its peak and now it has to end slowly
 saamaanya shrenee, pichhadon or alpsankhyakon kii numaaindgi karne vaale karmchaariyon ke sanghathan esaypieces (saamaanya, pichhadaa varg, alpsankhyak kalyaan samaaj) ne chunaav main apane ummidavaar utaarne kaa faisla kiya he
 As a result, it may harm the BJP in certain urban areas
 bhaajapa ko ummid he ki savarna or pichde uske haq main vot denge kyonki party ke taur par vahi unki swaabhaavik pasand he
 While this agitation was at its peak, the Chief Minister tried to extinguish the fire by saying that no case would be registered without investigation under the SC / ST Act
 magar uske baad essi / asti vot haath se chale jane ke dar se unhone chuppi saadh lee
 The state BJP is looking to Shah that they will find a way to break the alliance of upper castes and backward

 In his election meetings, the Chief Minister tells the total deposits, how many kilometers of roads he has built, how many areas have been brought under irrigation, how many medical colleges have been opened and the per capita GDP has gone up
 chunavi phaayde ke liye jis ek yojana par chouhan bahut zyada bharosa karke chal rahe hai, vah he sambal yojana jo june main launch kii gai thi
 This scheme is aimed at laborers in the unorganized sector and about 5 of those from Madhya Pradesh are the beneficiaries

 This scheme is for everyone and is not limited to SC, ST or OBC
 congress ne jahaan saaf taur par naram hindutv kaa rukh kar liya he, vahiin chouhan keval vikaas or vikaas kii baat kar rahe hai, is ummid se ki "hindu'' vot to harhaal main unke paale main aayega hi, par isse vikaas ke naam par diya jane vaala vot bhi unki jholii main aa saktaa he
 However, the BJP has decided to remain silent on "problematic" issues
 haal ke dinon main bhaajapa ke kisi bhi sheersh netaa ne notebandi yaa jiesti ko jaij tehraane kii koshish nahin kii
 Apart from this, the business class is also not very happy because of GST
 magar hindu vot ko majboot karne kii garaj se "ghuspaithiyon'' or rashtriya naagarikta register (enarasi) sareekhee theme par lautate hue unhen saaf taur par dekha ja saktaa he
 Shah has mentioned this in many of his public meetings

 Throwing onions and tomatoes on the road and agitating in various parts are evidently displeasing to the farmers, as was evident in the Mandsaur agitation last year, even before the purchase bonus of wheat and paddy for the last two years
 Payment was made, markets intervened and Bhavantar Yojana was introduced
 chouhan ko alabatta kisaanon ke samarthan kaa puraa bharosa he
 He said in a TV Today program, "congress talks about loan waiver in agriculture, but i have given Rs 31,000 crore to the agriculture sector to help the farmers
 die hai jo pehle kabhi nahin die gaye
 The BJP is also relying on the fact that farmers do not vote as compulsory farmers, but vote according to their caste

 Chauhan in particular and his party in general are desperate for the Congress to announce its chief ministerial candidate, which the party has survived till now, so that if Chauhan announces Kamal Nath's name in this election battle So "kisanputra Vs Industrialist" and if Jyotiraditya Scindia's name is announced, then it can be changed to "kisanputra Vs Maharaja"
 unhen is baat kaa bhi ehsaas he ki congress vyapam or ret kii avaidh khudaai sareekhe muddon ko uthaa sakati he, jo congress ke mutabik sidhe unki dahalij tak le jate hai, isiilie chouhan is baat par jor dene ja rahe hai ki kisi jaanch agency or adaalat ko vyapam main unke khilaaf kuch bhi nahin mila

 One is that Chauhan failed to bring Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who was the chief minister of his electoral fray in 2008 and 2013, as the state BJP president
 ek or ranneetikaar anil dave kaa dehanth ho gaya
 Secondly, in 2003 a dedicated group named Jawali was formed under the strategic plan
 yojana yah thi ki congress ke bade netaaon ke khilaaf baari-bharkam ummidavaaron ko utarkar unhen unki siton par hi gher diya jaae
 This time it resembles Chauhan's one-man show, in which his trusted warlords like Ministers Bhupendra Singh and Rampal Singh are involved in their own elections and they do not have much to handle things at the state level
 duusari taraf, congress ke paas 203 kii tarah kantilal bhuriya nahin hai, jinka koi samarthan aadhaar nahin he, balki is baar kamalnath hai jo molbhav kii apni kaabiliyat sabit kar chuke hai or kaarobaari gharaanon ke saath apane rishton kaa phayda uthaate hai

 tendukheda ke vidhayak sanjay sharma or bhandar ke purv vidhayak kamalaapat arya indore main 29 aktubar ko rahul gandhi kii sabha main congress main shaamil ho gaye
 But Chauhan himself is confident that if people's reaction to his Jan Aashirwad Yatra is considered a gesture, then he is winning

 akasar ham choti-choti baton ko nazarandaaj kar dete hai or yah saamaanya-sa niyam bhul jate hai ki baarikiyon par dhyaan dena jaruri he
 This is especially important in the case of health insurance
 ham apni sehat ko bhi khuda kii nemat maanakar nishcint rahete hai
 Do not take care of your body, take a lot of stress and do not even provide adequate health insurance
 aajkal swasth rahanaa sabase mahangaa he or iskaa ehsaas tab hota he, jab ham biimaar padate hai
 Nowadays, multi-specialty and super-specialty hospitals get excellent medical care, but its cost is skyrocketing
 isse paar paane ke liye jaruri he ki ek upyukt swasthya beemaa policy lee jaae
 In the olden days people used to get health insurance to save tax
 tab paanch lakh ru
 Had a limit and most people considered it sufficient
 adhikansh log yah nahin samajhate ki swasthya beemaa cover to utana hi rahata he
 It does not take care of inflation
 mahangaai badhati jaati he or uske saath-saath chikitsa kaa kharch bhi
 Therefore, one has to keep in mind that the cover is sufficient to meet the rising inflation
 swasthya beemaa policy kharidte samay in baton kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie:ayaagar aapaki aayu kam he to aapkaa shuruaati premium kam hoga
 This will increase as the insurance company crosses the slab with age
 policy kabhi bhi lee ja sakati he
 By taking no policy, it is better to take the policy late
 puraani bimariyon kaa byoresgar aapke parivaar main kuch bimaariyaan hai to aapako bhi unke hone kaa khatra he
 In this case, you should buy the policy immediately
 agar aapako pehle se koi beemaari he to beemaa company uske ilaaj ko aapaki policy main shaamil nahin karegi
 Especially if that disease is in your family as well
 aisi sthiti main aisi policy chune, jisamen vah beemaari cover hoti ho
 Job nature Your work related activities can cause stress related diseases
 aapaki policy main is baat kaa khyaal rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Premium: If the premium you want to buy, if the premium seems too high, then take the same amount of policy that you can pay or choose a cheaper option like family floater
 apane or apane puure parivaar ke liye aisa plan chune, jo aapke yaa aapaki patni ke niyokta yaa company se mili beemaa laabh ke atirikt ho
 You will benefit from this
 aajkal tarah-tarah ke health plan milte hai
 Personal, Topup, Family Floater, Senior Citizen etc
 aap uljhan main pad jate hai ki koun-sa plan len
 Put your expectations and concerns in front of your advisor
 isse aapako yah tay karne main madad milegi ki policy se aap kya laabh lenaa chaahate hai
 If you are getting attractive discounts then the immediate attraction is the whole family insurance
 lekin jaraa is bare main sochie ki kya hoga, jab aapke bachche kii umr 21 yaa 25 saal ho jaaegi
 To what age can your elderly parents benefit from it
 beemaa udyog abhi apane shuruaati charan main he, isliye logon ko yah bharosa dilaanaa chahta he ki sabhi product ek jaise hai
 But check thoroughly whether the product is worth you or not
 aakhir main policy dastavej ko apane salaahkaar ke saath avashya padhein
 Understand its terms, conditions and limitations

 On Monday, during the meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Barack Obama's tongue slipped and he addressed Modi as 'president Modi' instead of Prime Minister

 In a video released on the White House official website, Obama praised Modi and said - 'president Modi's efforts in energy have given us strength
 'white house ne baad main sudhari galatiobama kaa ye bayaanpahale hoobahoo site par aplod kar diya gaya lekin baad main jab isaki jaankaree adhikariyon ko hui to video main sudhaar karke dobaaraa use website par lagaaya gaya
 However, this mistake of Obama did not come in any kind of controversy

 He said that we are committed to taking forward and strengthening relations between the two countries
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kathinaaiyon se paar pate hue sheersh par pahunchane ke safar ko bayaan karte hue kendriya vittamantri arun jetali ne kaha ki narendra modi kii asli takat unke majboot iraade hai
 Their intentions are as strong as the players
 aaj se 15 saal pehle jab donon netaa bijepi pravaktaa the, tabhi se jetali ne modi ko kaaphi kareeb se dekha or yah paaya ki vah (modi) anushaasan ke maamle main khud ko bhi dheel nahin dete or unamem gaharaa aatmavishvaas he
 Jaitley said that it is due to his qualities that he takes forward his agenda of development despite the tone of opposition
 unke inhen gunon ke kaaran vah rajnatik paridrishy main bejod dikhaai dete hai
 Arun Jaitley, who also holds the responsibility of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, said, "while in government, it is needless to say that he is very hardworking and continues to work
" har vibhaag ke bare main unhen spasht rup se pataa rahata he ki kis-kisko kya-kya karnaa he
 On the rise of Prime Minister Modi, Jaitley said that many of his qualities have contributed in this direction
 modi behad kushagra hai, unamem seekhney kii adbhut lagan he or vah ek antarrashtriya netaa ke taur par talmail baitaane kii kshamta rakhte hai
 Jaitley said, he has a great passion for learning and that is why he has reached here
 
 
 or ab jab unhen diplomasi main apni chhap chhodane kaa mauka mil rahaa he, to aap dekh sakate hai ki kuch hi maheenon ke bheetar vah ek mukhyamantri se pradhanmantri or phir ek shaktishaalee antarrashtriya netaa ke rup main saamne aae hai
 Jaitley said, i do not think that in the political scenario there will be more people who can do all this so fast
 modi kii lagan or lakshya par unki sadhi hui najar ke bare main jetali ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki unki asli takat tab dikh gai thi, jab vah gujarat gaye the
 
 
 i think that was the real test of their acceptance
 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke dauraan kanoon or media dwaara lee gai pariksha kaa paroksh rup se zikr karte hue jetali ne kaha ki modi ne 'virdohi swaron' se pareshaan hue bina vikaas ke agenda par dhyaan kendrit karte hue rajya par shashan kiya
 Regarding the difficulties faced by Modi after the 2002 riots, Jaitley said that most people were not ready to even reveal his point of view, but he directly interacted with the public regardless of media and prepared his roadmap and agenda
 
 
 
 ye agenda tha, gujarat kaa vikaas
 Jaitley said, and what i said about his strong intentions (I want to say) that he would not deviate from this agenda for the next 10–12 years and instead of reacting to the agenda of his critics, he kept his agenda at the center And eventually succeeded
 modi kii kshamtaaon kaa varnan karte hue jetali ne kaha, unka apane aapmen or apane kaam main bahut bharosa he
 In this context, he cited Modi's use of Hindi on the stage of international diplomacy and tentatively delivered speeches in English
 haal hi main modi ne australia main angreji main bhaashan diya tha
 Regarding his abilities to run the government at the Center, Jaitley said that despite all the criticism, he (modi) has 12 years of experience in running a government in Gujarat
 modi khud behad mehnatee hai or hameshaa kaam main lage rahete hai
 He is very clear about what each department of government has to do
 unhone kaha, unki is par khaas pakad he
 His point of view is quite clear
 vah apane karyaalay main apni mul team ke saath-saath naukarshahon or mantriyon se bhi jaankaree lete rahete hai
 The Aravalli Biodiversity Park of Gurugram spread over 380 acres is in danger of existence
 gurugram ke green langs ke naam se jane vaale is park ko banane main gurugram ke aam nagarikon or local enjio ko 7 saal lag gaye, lekin ab is khubasurat aravali habitat ke bich-bich gurugram manesar expresve ko le jane kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya he, jiskaa kaam november se shuru karne kii taiyaari he
 This biodiversity park is situated on the Aravali belt which was ruled by mining mafia 7 years ago due to which the land here was completely hollow and barren
 lekin logon ne din-raat mehnat kar korporate or gurugram municipal corporation kii madad se is ujaad jagah ko aravali kii vanaspatiyon or pedo se bhar diya
 The forest is now home to around 182 species of 400 different species of trees and birds, where wild jackals and reptiles also live
 is park main teen tareeke ke trek banaae gaye hai, running trek, walking trek or cycling trek jiskaa istemaal yahaan rojaanaa subah shaam aane vaale log karte hai, lekin kuch hi maheenon main haive ke nirmaan ke chalate yah tabah ho jayega
 Gurugram has become a full-fledged concrete city of high-rising societies and large multinational companies
 yahaan shahar main hare bhare kshetra na ke baraabar hai
 Meanwhile, the highway project is set to take up about 25 acres of the park, on which the botanist Vijay Dhasmana, who played a major role in the preparation of this park, believes that because this expressway is a preparation to be taken out from the middle of this forest
 
 iskaa sidhaa asar yahaan ke pakshiyon or vanaspatiyon par padegaa or zyaadaatar prajatiyaan nasht ho jaaengi
 In Gurugram, where the water problem is getting deeper every day, in such circumstances, this park delivers about 28-28 trillion tonnes of water to the ground level throughout the year
 is jangal kaa khud kaa natural water rigervoyr bhi he or sabase acchhee baat ye he ki yahaan ke ped-paudhon ko zyada dekh bhaal yaa pani kii jarurat bhi nahin padati
 They control the rising temperature of Gurugram, provide pure air and are contributing to increase the amount of water at ground level
 lekin park menexpress-webanane ke baad yahaan se rojaanaa guzarane vaali gadiyon ke dhuen ke kaaran kuch bhi nahin bachegaa
 We contacted government departments in this regard, but no one gave us a reply on this
 aise main vikaas ke naam par cat rahe pedo or ujaad die ja rahe jangalon kii bharpai kaise hogi ye ek bada sawaal he

 26 years ago today (10 November) proved to be a very emotional day in world cricket history
 21 saal tak world cricket se kate rahane ke baad 1991 main dakshin africa ne apana pehla antarrashtriya match khelaa tha
 Above all, the African team got 'new life' on Indian soil
 rangabhed niti ke kaaran duniya ne is desh se duuri bana lee thi
 South Africa's team visited India within 4 months of joining the International Cricket Council (ICC)
 vaapasi ke baad usne apana pehla antarrashtriya match kolkata ke eden gardens main khelaa tha
 However, India won that match by 3 wickets
 apane pehle hi match main tej gendbazelan donaldne apni chhap chodi thi
 He took 5 wickets for 29 runs
 donald or sachin tendulkar (62 ran, 1 wicket) us match main sanyukt rup se main of da match rahe
 The captain of that African team was Clive Rice, although today he is not in this world
 66 saal kii umr main 28 july 2015 ko unka nidhan ho gaya
 In fact, the South Africa government had enacted some rules which left the ICC in a dilemma
 sarkaar ke niyamon ke mutabik unki desh kii team ko shwet deshon (england, australia or newjiland) ke khilaaf hi khilne kii anumati thi
 It was also a condition that only white players would play in the opposition team
 isisi ne dakshin africa ko nilambit kar diya, jisase africa khilaadiyon kaa bhavishya par khatre main pad gaya
 The career of many cricketers from there ended in waiting for when the South African team will return to international cricket
 aakhirkaar 21 saal baad vah din aayaa, jab dakshin africa main badlaav aayaa or vahaan rangabhed kii niti ko khatm kiya gaya
 Just before leaving for the UK tour, Team India coach Ravi Shastri said that yo-yo test is very important for fitness and selection in cricket and said that this test can be made a place in Team India
 lekin ab ye test vivaadon main aa gaya he
 The Indian team management is following the yo-yo test as a fitness criterion, but the issue of Ambati Rayudu being dropped from the team is in the mind of COA chief Vinod Rai and he can ask the BCCI that for selection in the national team Why is it the only fitness criterion

 Who would not recognize that special style of saying 'barkhurdar' in a serious voice
 vah abhinayta praan hai, jo apane bemisaal abhinay se har kirdaar mempranadal dete the
 Be it the character of the disabled in 'upkar' or Akkad Pathan in 'zanjeer'
 praan aise actor the jinka cheharaa har kirdaar ko nibhaate hue yah ahsaas chhod jaataa tha ki unke bina is kirdaar kii pahchaan mithyaa he
 Today, on the birthday of this famous actor, let us know some interesting things about him: 1
 pranaka puraa naam praan krishna sikand tha or unka janm 12 farvari, 1920 ko puraani dilli ke ballimaran ilaake main ek sampann parivaar main hua tha
 2
 praan bachapan se hi padhai main kaaphi hoshiyaar the
 Very few people know that Pran, who convinced the audience with his acting, wanted to become a photographer, not an actor
 lekin bhagya ne unke liye kuch or hi soch rakhaa tha
 For which he also joined an institute
 3
 Pran was not sure of coming to the movies like that
 hua yun ki ek baar lekhak mohammad vali nepranako ek paan kii dukaan par khadey dekha, us samay vah punjabi film 'yamala jet' ko banane kii yojana bana rahe the
 At first sight, Vali decided that Pran would work in his film
 unhone praan ko film main kaam karne ke liye raji kiya
 The film was released in 1940 and was a huge hit
 4
 After this Pran acted in many more Punjabi films and earned a name as a successful villain in the Lahore film industry
 5
 In 1942, filmmaker Dalsukh Pancholi gave Pran a chance to work in his Hindi film 'khanadan'
 6
 After Partition, Pran left Lahore and moved to Mumbai
 lahore main chaahe praan ne kaaphi naam kamaaya lekin unhen hindi cinema main paanv jamaane ke liye ek nae kalakaar kii tarah sangharsh karnaa padaa
 7
 praan ko lekhak shahadat hasan manto or actor shyaam kii sahaayta se bombai tokies kii film 'ziddee' main kaam mila
 8
 iske baad praan 'aaazaad', 'madhumati', 'devdas', 'dil diya dard liya', 'ram or shyaam', 'aadmi', 'munimji', 'amardip', 'johny meraa naam', 'vaardaat', 'des pardes' jaisi filmon main khalanaayak ke rup main najar aae
 9
 praan ko hindi cinema main unke yogadan ke liye 2001 main bharat sarkaar ne padam bhushan se sammanit kiya or 2013 main unhen film jagat ke sarvocch sammaan dada sahib phalke sammaan bhi pradaan kiya gaya
 10
 praan 1969 se 1982 ke bich sabase zyada fees paane vaale actor the, yahaan tak kii unki filmon kaa mehtanasuperstar rajesh khanna se bhi zyada hua karata tha
 11
 'don' film ke liye jahaan amitabh bachchan ko 2
 a fee of Rs 5 lakh was received, while Pran was given a fee of Rs 5 lakh
 12
 Pran was fond of collecting smoking pipes and walking sticks
 13
 Pran did not tell his father during the first shoot that he is acting in the film, he thinks his father will get angry
 yahaan tak kii jab unka pehla intervyuu akhbaar main chapa to praan ne apnibahanon se wo akhbaar chupa dene tak ko kaha
 But later, when his father came to know, he did not get angry at all
 14
 The song 'yaari Hai Iman Mera', shot on Pran in the film 'zanjeer', is still an evergreen song due to his special performance
 diarector prakaash mehara ko film 'zanjeer' ke liye amitabh bachchan kaa naam praan ne hi sujhaayaa tha, jisantamitabhake kariyar ko nai disha di
 See the song 'yaari Hai Imaan

 In the local of 29, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis traveled with ordinary passengers sitting and talking to them
 darasal mukhyamantri ko somvaar kii shaam ek kaarykram main hissaa lene ke liye kalyaan janaa tha
 Their program was very busy since morning, so they were insisting on saving time since morning
 subah alibagh jane ke liye bhi unhone getwe se boat kaa safar kiya
 Returned, attended an event in Kulaba
 sadak maarg se kalyaan pahunchane main kaaphi vakt lagata isliye kulaba kaa kaarykram khatm kar siem kaa kafila sidhe siasti stesan pahunch gaya
 There 6

 People were pleasantly surprised when suddenly the CM along with his team climbed into a box of this local
 shaam ko offis se ghar lautne vaale ammumbaikaron kii bheedsiasti stesan par thi
 In such a situation, many passengers were eyebrows seeing the large team of soldiers engaged in their security with CM, but when CM reached the local compartment and started talking to the passengers, the atmosphere became normal
 kai yatriyon ne local trainon main bheed kam karne kaa koi intjaam karne kii request siem se kar daali
 Several mobile phone cameras were turned on simultaneously
 koi selfi le rahaa tha to koi video bana rahaa tha
 Many travelers have made a call directly to their house and made CM talk to their family members

 In this meeting, Mayawati will discuss about expanding the Bahujan Samaj Party, preparing a new strategy, preparations for the Uttar Pradesh by-election and changes in the party
 is dauraan mayawati bispi ke padaadhikariyon se samaajawaadee party (sapa) se gathbandhan ko lekar sthiti saaf kar sakati hai, taaki party kaaryakartaaon main gathbandhan ke tuutane ko lekar koi duvidha na rahe
 Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party contested the Lok Sabha elections together
 haalanki donon partiyon ko santoshjanak nattejey nahin mili
 Bahujan Samaj Party won only 10 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh and Samajwadi Party won only 5 seats
 mishan-2022 kaa lakshyabaspa upachunaav ke sahare 2022 ke vidhansabha chunaav kaa rasta taiyaar karne kii taiyaari main jute gai he
 After the success of the Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati has started feeling like number two in UP that the party will be able to win a large number of seats in the by-elections and can win the next assembly elections
 loksabhaa chunaav kii tarah hi vidhansabha ke upachunaav main bhi basapa ke liye haarane ko kuch he nahin, jeetne ko sara maidan or ladane kaa bharpoor madda bhi he
 In the last assembly elections, Mayawati has been successful in saving her 'base vote' even by taking the iron out of BJP wave and sp-congress alliance alone
 isiilie basapa mukhiya ne gathbandhan ke bager hi upachunaav main akele haath ajamaane kii sochi he
 BSP chief Mayawati definitely has the foundation to win at least four of the 11 by-elections
 sutron kaa kahana he ki gathbandhan main donon dalon ke bich yah sahmati bani thi ki sapa loksabhaa chunaav main mayawati ko pradhanmantri ke taur par pesh kar apni rajamandi degi, jabaki basapa 2022 ke vidhansabha chunaav main akhilesh yadav ko mukhyamantri ke pad kaa samarthan karegi
 The BSP will remain in the politics of the Center and the SP will handle the politics of UP
 isiilie gathbandhan bhi bana tha, lekin chunaav parinaam bijepi ke paksh main aane se donon ke mansoobon par pani phir gaya
 However, for future politics, Mayawati is probably in the mood to review and test the strength of the organization
 shaayad isiilie upachunaav ke liye gathbandhan todane ke baad bhi sapa se puri tarah brallep na hone kii baat kahkar phir haath milaane kaa vikalp khulaa rakhaa he
 The results of the by-elections will give a hint to the extent that now the political journey alone will be difficult or normal for the BSP

 # 2 zero 14 bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne aise vakt main pradhanmantri manmohan singh or unke pakistani samakaksh navaj sharif ke bich hone vaali baatcheet kii jarurat par sawaal khadey kiye hai, jab jammu-kashmir main aatankwaadi ‘din-raat’ sena ke javaanon or maasoom logon ko maut ke ghat utaar rahe hai
 Addressing a rally in Trichy, on Thursday, Modi slammed the Center for 'following a weak policy' to deal with Pakistan
 modi ne kaha, ‘aisa kaise hota he ki pakistani sainik hamaari sarajameen par aakar hamaare sainikon kaa galaa kaat dete hai or unke sir apane saath le jate hai? kya vajah he ki pakistani sena seemaa par hamaare javaanon ko maut ke ghat utaarti he or dilli kii sarkaar pakistani pradhanmantri ko biryani khilaane par protocol kii duhai detii he?’ The Chief Minister of Gujarat said, "more than the soldiers who were not martyred in the battlefield, more than the bullets of the terrorists were killed
 mujhe is baat kaa gussa he ki dilli main aisi sarkaar he
 ' gauratlab he ki aaj hue dohare fidaayin hamale main aatankwaadiyon ne jammu kshetra main ek police thane or thalsena ke ek shivi ko nishaanaa banaaya jisamen sena ke ek leftinent karnal sahit 10 log maare gaye
 The attack comes at a time when the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan are scheduled to meet in New York on 29 September
 prastaavit baatcheet ke babat modi ne kaha, ‘‘main aapse ek sawaal karnaa chahta hum - jab hamaare sainik or maasoom naagarik din-raat maare ja rahe hon, aatankwaadi hamen pareshaan karnaa jari rakhe hue hon, hamaare nirdosh logon ko maut ke ghat utaar rahe hon, to aise halaat main kya yah centre sarkaar kaa jaldbaaji main kiya gaya faisla nahin he ki vah pakistani netaaon se baat kar rahi he?’’ Modi said, 'one question comes in the mind of every citizen, are we really so weak that our neighbors do whatever they want and we should not react
 hamen iske liye kyon majaboor kiya ja rahaa he ki ham apni ankhen band kar chupchaap in yaatnaaon ko sahen
 '' apane sambodhan main modi ne pakistan or srilanka dwaara bhartiya machuaaron kii giraftaar ke mudde par bhi centre par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Modi said, "pakistan arrests a large number of fishermen along the Gujarat coast and keeps them in jail for six months to a year
" unhen pratadit kiya jaataa he
 Sri Lanka has also started adopting this method
 darasal samasya samudr main nahin, centre main he
 ' logon se upie sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkane kii apil karte hue modi ne kaha ki centre kii ek kamjor sarkaar ne bharat ke padosiyon ko saahsee bana diya he
 Modi said, 'the biggest reason for such a situation is that the neighboring countries take India lightly
 in samasyaon kaa pramukh kaaran yahi he
 Comments pichley saal farvari main do italvi marinon dwaara do bhartiya machuaaron kii goli markar hatya kar die jane ke mudde par modi ne kaha, ‘main to is baat par hairaan hum ki log italy se aakar 1
 In this country with a population of 2 billion, fishermen are killed off the coast of Kerala
 ’ Modi also criticized the Center on the issue of economic plight
 trichi main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue guuruuvaar ko modi ne pakistan se nipatane ke liye ‘ek kamjor niti kaa paalan’ karne par centre ko aade haath liya
 Modi said, 'how does it happen that Pakistani soldiers come to our land and cut our soldiers' throats and take their heads with them? What is the reason that the Pakistani army kills our jawans on the border and Delhi's government calls for protocol on feeding biryani to the Pakistani Prime Minister? ' gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘jang ke maidan main jitne sainik shahid nahin hue, usase zyada to aatankwaadiyon kii goliyon kii bhent chadh gaye
 i am angry that there is such a government in Delhi
 ’ Significantly, in the double suicide attack that took place today, militants targeted a police station and an army camp in Jammu region, in which 10 people, including an army lieutenant colonel, were killed
 yah hamalaa aise samay main hua he jab 29 sitambar ko bharat or pakistan ke pradhanmantri neuyork main mulaakaat karne vaale hai
 Regarding the proposed conversation, Modi said, "I want to ask you one question - when our soldiers and innocent civilians are being killed day and night, terrorists continue to harass us, killing our innocent people If in such a situation, is it not a hasty decision of the Central Government that it is talking to Pakistani leaders? '' modi ne kaha, ‘ek sawaal har naagarik ke jehan main aata he ki kya ham vaaki itane kamjor hai ki hamaare padosi jo chaahe karen or ham koi pratikriya na karen
 Why are we being forced to close our eyes and bear these tortures silently
 ’’ In his address, Modi also targeted the Center on the issue of arrest of Indian fishermen by Pakistan and Sri Lanka
 modi ne kaha, ‘pakistan gujarat tat ke paas badi taadaad main machuaaron ko giraftaar kar letaa he or unhen chah maheene se saal bhar jail main rakhata he
 They are tortured
 srilanka bhi ab yahi tarika apnaane laga he
 Actually the problem is not in the sea, but in the center
 ’ Appealing to the people to overthrow the UPA government, Modi said that a weak government at the center has made India's neighbors courageous
 modi ne kaha, ‘aisi sthiti kii sabase badi vajah yah he ki padosi desh bharat ko halke main lete hai
 This is the main reason for these problems
 ’tippaniyan On the issue of two Indian fishermen being shot dead by two Italian marines in February last year, Modi said, 'I am surprised that people come from Italy 1

 bihar ke purv up- mukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki ham logon kii galati thi ki hamane aapako siem bana diya
 Tejashwi was speaking at the Garib Mahasammelan organized by former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi at Gandhi Maidan in Patna
 bataa den ki nitish kumaar ne kuch din pehle kaha tha ki hamaari galati se kuch log netaa ban gaye
 Although he did not name anyone, but it is believed that Nitish Kumar said this to former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi
 ab tejasvi yadav ne iskaa jawaab dete huenithish kumaar par sidhaa warakia or kaha ki hindustan main shaayad hi kisi rajya main chaar saal main chaar sarkaar bani hon
 He said that the Bihar government called Mohan Bhagwat to incite a riot
 saath hi unhone aarope lagaate hue kaha ki bihar sarkaar ko nagpur se chalaaya ja rahaa he
 Former Chief Minister Jitaram Manjhi called this conference because Chief Minister Nitish Kumar did not implement any of the 34 decisions he had taken while he was in office, although Manjhi was made by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 maanjhi ne nitish kumaar se un faislon ko lagu karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Jitan Ram Manjhi requested Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to implement the decision that we have taken
 maanjhi ne kaha ki ham jis sapane ko lekar endie main gaye the wo puraa nahin ho sakaa
 Manjhi said that i had requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi that reservation in judicial service should also be implemented but the Prime Minister ignored it
 unhone kaha ki nyaay vyastha main daliton kii bhagidaari kam hone ke kaaran daliton ko nyaay nahin mil paata he
 Manjhi, while supporting Lalu Prasad Yadav's demand, said that the caste census report should be made public, which are multi-caste and backward should be benefited
 maanjhi ne kaha ki desh main daliton kii sthiti thik nahin he
 On this occasion, Tejashwi Yadav fiercely targeted the BJP and said that the present central government is anti-reservation and they want to abolish the reservation
 ye dalit virdohi hai
 Want to spread hate in society
 bijepi desh kii samskruti khatm karnaa chaahati he
 He said that BJP has only 6 agenda
 mandir, masjid, danga, hindu, muslim or pakistan or ye sab keval janata ko bhatakaane ke liye hai
 Tejashwi said that Lalu Yadav kept raising the voice of the public but the BJP and Nitish Kumar harassed and enticed him
 kendriya mantri giriraaj singh par dalit kii jameen hadapney kaa aarope he lekin unka kuch nahin hua
 Lalu ji did not commit any crime but still he was implicated
 maanjhi ne kaha ki ham nitish kumaar se ek vinati karnaa chaahate hai ki unka jo sharabbandi kanoon he usamen sanshodhan kiya jaae, kyonki usase sabase zyada nuksaan daliton or garibon kaa hi ho rahaa he, bekasoor log pakade ja rahe hai
 Although we had firstly supported Nitish Kumar's prohibition of liquor, but from the present situation it seems that this law is being used only for the poor and dalits
 tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki jeethanram maanjhi ke mahagathbandhan main aane se gathbandhan majboot hua he

 On this day, officers of 20 first class services including Indian Revenue Service (IRS), Indian Police Service (IPS), Indian Railway Service (IRS) met Minister of State Jitendra Singh in the Prime Minister's Office and said in brief words that The unanimous rule of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers on top posts should be abolished
 vaise to ye adhikari canfederation of civil services association (coksa) ke binar tale sidhe pradhanmantri se milanaa chaahate the, lekin piemo ne shuruaati taur par jitendra singh ko is maamle ko dekhne ko kaha
 There is a direct demand of these officers that they also get a chance to equalize in the posts of Secretary, Additional Secretary and Joint Secretary in the Government of India
 barabari kii is ladaai ko samajhane se pehle kuch chijen jaananaa jaruri he
 For example, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) conducts the Civil Services Entrance Examination to run administration in India
 safal hone vaale abhyarthiyon ko merit ke aadhaar par iees, iesces, ipies, iares sahit 37tarah kii sevaaon main bheja jaataa he
 All the officers who have arrived in these services from the due date have the same right to sit in high positions in the central government on deputation
 lekin vyaavhaarik sthiti isse ulat he
 According to the Seventh Pay Commission report, only 80 percent of the posts of Secretary level, 92 percent of the level of Additional Secretary and 64 percent of the rank of Joint Secretary are occupied by IAS officers only
 in halaat se duusare afasar kitne khafa hai, iskaa andaja saatven vetan ayog ke adhyaksh justise e
 K
 maathur ne apni report main diya, ''baaki sevaaon ke adhikariyon main kasamasaahat kii vajah yahi he ki lambey samay se iees afasaron ne prashasan kii sabhi shaktiyon par kabja kar rakhaa he or baaki sevaaon ke afasaron ko doum darje par dhakel diya he
 The main reason for the complaint is that all the posts in most areas, whether technical or administrative, are with IAS officers today
 ab vah samay aa gaya he jab sarkaar kadam badaye ki visheshgyata ke aadhaar par posting kii jaae
 If all services are not treated with honest and equal treatment, then the gap between IAS and other services will widen
 antat isse araajaktaa failegi jo prashasan or desh ke liye acchhee nahin hogi
 "jayant Mishra, Convenor of Coxa and General Secretary of IRS Association, who met Jitendra Singh with the delegation, says," Our struggle is not against any individual or service, but we want that hardworking and honest persons in the interest of the country, whether Be of any service, they should be posted in appropriate positions, so that they can contribute properly for the progress of the country
 "vetan or pramotion main visangatigaiyr iees civil sevakon kii pehali samasya yah he ki niyukti ke samay sabko samaan vetan miltaa he, lekin chaar saal baad jab afasar junior time scale se senior time scale par aate hai, to iees adhikariyon ko do atirikti increment milte hai
 Similarly, once you reach junior administration grade from the senior time scale, again you get two additional increments
 aage ke pramotion main bhi yahi baat doharaai jaati he
 The Seventh Pay Commission had recommended to remove this discrepancy
 duusari sevaaon ke afasaron kii yah bhi shikaayat he ki iees afasar kaa pramotion samay rahete kar diya jaataa he, jabaki unki filein lambey samay tak lataki rahati hai
 The major challenge of the officers of other services on deputation is their preference for deputation
 har seva se sanyukt sachiv str par deputesan main aane laayak adhikariyon kaa panel banaaya jaataa he
 Then from this panel, the departments sort the officers according to the need
 koska ke ek sadsy ne bataaya, ''deputesan to dur kii baat, panel ke gathan se hi hamaare saath sautela vyavhaar shuru ho jaataa he
 While the panel up to 1999 batch of IAS has been constituted for Joint Secretary, the panel of 1993 batch of IPS, 1990 batch of IRS and 1987 batch of Railway Services has been formed
 jab panel gathit hi nahin honge to deputesan par jaaenge kaise?" iares seva ke ek varisht adhikari ne dhyaan dilaayaa ki is kaam main sabase mahatvapurn bhoomika carmik vibhaag or civil sarvice board kii hoti he
 But the secretaries in the personnel department, both the additional secretaries and the six joint secretaries belong to the IAS cadre, so how will justice be done to the rest of the services? The Civil Services Board is also fully occupied by the IAS
 haal yah he ki june 2015 main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne baaki sevaaon ke 1995 batch tak capanel kaa disambar 2015 tak gathan karne kaa nirdesh diya, lekin dedline bitne ke 14 maheene baad bhi panel kaa gathan nahin ho sakaa he
 IRS (excise and Tax) officers have been infuriated by the GST widening of these widening discrepancies, with the top posts in the Goods and Services Tax Network being given to IAS officers
 bajet se pehle 30 janvari ko in adhikariyon ne kaali pattee baandhakar pradarshan bhi kiya tha
 Virag Gupta, a former IRS officer and advocate of tax affairs in the Supreme Court, says, "revenue Service officials fear that most of the tax work going to the states will reduce their status
" bhavishya main pad bhi kam ho sakate hai
 "in such a situation, the only way these officers can see is that there should be a complete change in the deputation process
 kya iees ke sahare sarkaar chalaa rahe pradhanmantri yah badlaav kar paaenge? The fourth front in Bihar is over

 The by-elections in 18 seats are to be held
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, these two leaders have repeatedly reiterated that they are now taking last breath
 bihar main 18 siton par upachunaav hone hai
 In this by-election, where Lalu and Paswan are fighting together, this friendship has reached the brink of collapse due to the Samajwadi Party launching its candidates
 chauthe morche par puche gaye ek sawaal ke jabaab main lalu ne kaha ki mulaayam singh ke saath unka chunavi gathbandhan loksabhaa chunaavon tak tha ab jise ladanaa he lade, sambandh rakhana he rakhe

 NDMC has awarded a contract to a foreign company to build this digital wall at a cost of around 5 crore

 Complaints of Aam Aadmi Party workers receiving threats were coming from few days
 ab party ke kaaryakartaaon par hamale bhi shuru ho chuke hai
 Hundreds of Aam Aadmi Party workers reached the Shakarpur police station shouting slogans late at night
 unka aarope tha ki congress kaaryakartaaon ne aam aadmi party ke kaaryakartaaon ke saath badasluki kii or yashoda naam kii mahila kaaryakarta ke saath marpet bhi kii
 Party leader Manish Sisodia says that the Congress is not tolerating the honest politics of the Aam Aadmi Party, hence its workers are being beaten
 badi baat ye he ki police bhi samay rahete karrwai nahin kar rahi
 According to Manish Sisodia, the women activist knows all the accused and is also mentioning their names

 ayodhya vivaad par 9 november ko supreme court ke faisle par muslim samudaay kii pratikriya kamobesh aisi hi thi
 Despair, Surrender and Relief
 jaahir he, yah samudaay koi ek rajnatik door main nahin bandhaa he or pratikriya vibhinn staron par banty hui he
 It is influenced by loyalty attached to class, region and even to the cults within it
 samudaay ke netaa or maulavee maamle ke kanoonee nattejey se khush nahin hai, par lagata he ki ve ise shanti se sweekaar kar chuke hai
 Common Muslims consider it better to buried the issue
 faisla bhale hi unke paksh main nahin ho, par hinduon ke saath is samudaay kaa sabase bada vivaad aakhirkaar 'sulajh' gaya or ve apane rojaanaa ke kaam main jute sakate hai
 Given the suzerainty of the Hindutva organizations, other Muslim leaders, except a few, have accepted the verdict as a pre-decided outcome and do not want it to remain in political discourse
 faisal ke turant baad, supreme court main muslim vaadiyon ke pairokaar varisht adhivaktaa jafarayab jilani ne kaha, ''ham supreme court ke faisle se santusht nahin hai par ham uskaa sammaan karenge
 The five acres of alternative land given to Muslims have no value to them
 '' adhiktar muslim dharmaguru faisle se niraash hai par ve ise adaalaton main aage le jane ko icchhuk nahin hai
 Noor ur-rehman Barkati, former royal imam of Tipu Sultan Islamic Center in Kolkata, appears to be abandoning the issue, "the judges are human and not supreme like Allah
" isliye aisa nahin he ki ve jo faisla sunaaen vah galat hi na ho
 i understand that there will be no debate or review petition after this, but it is also true that the Muslim community is saddened by the decision
 vah adhyay ab band ho chukaa he
 We have to accept the decision with a heavy heart because a community gets justice
 
 
 jabaki duusare samudaay ko anyaay
 Muslims across the country are silent as they do not see any hope
 ''islamic vishvavidhyalay daarul ulum devband ke up-kulapati, mufti abul kasim nomani kehete hai, ''maamla jameen ke malikana haq ke bare main tha or supreme court ne spasht nahin kiya ki jameen kaa sahi maalik koun he
 We believe that a mosque is the property of Allah and Muslims cannot own it
 ''dilli sthit 17veen shatabdi kii fatehpuri masjid ke shahi imam mufti em
 Mukarram Ahmed is not confused about the decision
 ve kehete hai, ''jaahir he, adaalat kaa faisla yogyata ke aadhaar par nahin, balki aasthaa par aadhaarit tha
 However, he sees the verdict as a practical solution to the issue
 ve kehete hai, ''faisle main musalamaanon kii bhaawanaaon kaa khyaal rakhane kii koshish karte hue adaalat ne sarkaar ko masjid banane ke liye bhi ek bhukhand dene kaa aadesh diya he
 After this decision, they are impressed by the mature response of all communities
 ve kehete hai, ''jo baat mere dil ko chhu gai, vah aresas or vihip jaise hindu sanghathanon kii apil thi ki is faisle kaa jashn jeet ke rup main na manaaya jaae
 Muslim organizations also appealed to the people for peace despite their disappointment
 desh ne is faisle ke baad bahut paripakvata dikhaai he
 "this peaceful response is also a relief for Naved Hamid, general secretary of All India Muslim majlis-e-mushawarat (MMM), a consortium of various Muslim organizations in India
 muslim sanghathan is faisle ke virodhabhaason se niraash to hai par sadak par koi pradarshan or hinsa jaisi ghatnaayen nahin huin
 He says, "the Supreme Court considered the statues to be placed at the disputed site in 1949 and it was a violation of law
" isane 1992 main babari masjid ke vidhwans kii bhi ninda kii
 Nevertheless it gave the land to another party
 aisi visangatiyon or chintaaon ke baavjood, musalamaanon ne faisle kaa swaagat kiya he
 "especially the leaders of the Shia community of Uttar Pradesh have always taken a soft stance on the claims of Hindus
 tab bhi jab shiya central vakf board ke daawey ke supreme court se khaarij hone or paanch acre jameen ko sunni paksh ko die jane se ve niraash hai
 "I was always in favor of the Ram temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi site in Ayodhya," says Wasim Rizvi, president of the Shia Central Waqf Board
 babari masjid kaa nirmaan ek shiya mir baaki ne kiya tha
 So the land should have been given to the Shia Central Waqf Board instead of being given to the Sunni Waqf Board
 ''ek pramukh shiya dharmaguru kalbe sadik kehete hai, ''ayodhya hinduon ke liye ek pavitra sthaan he
 The decision of the Supreme Court will increase harmony between Hindus and Muslims
 main musalamaanon kii ore se is faisle ke khilaaf apil karne ke paksh main nahin hum
 In fact, i am not in favor of building a mosque in Ayodhya, the mosque can be built anywhere else
 '' bohari samudaay ne bhi faisle kaa swaagat kiya he
 Zahid Gunwala, a Bohri Muslim leader in Ujjain, says, "the Supreme Court's decision is logical
 ''aam musalmaan is masale ko dafn karne ke liye faisle ko sweekaar kar rahaa he
 Abdul Hafeez, a skilled laborer from Bhopal, says, "even though the Hindus have been given land to build the temple, i am relieved that the case has been sealed
" musalmaan vaise bhi vahaan ibaadat nahin kar pate the
 Hopefully, the issue that was kept alive only for political gains
 '' samudaay kii pratikriya mukhya rup se yahi he ki faisla kanoonee se zyada rajnatik he
 Syed Shamsul Hasan Arif, owner of Nadeem, Bhopal's Urdu newspaper, believes the same
 par ve kehete hai, ''phir bhi musalmaan yah maanate hai ki agar ise sauhardpurn dhang se hal karnaa tha to is mudde kaa yahi sabase acha sambhav samaadhaan bhi he
 The reaction in Muslim political class extends from aggression to pragmatism
 sthaneey siyaasi vajahen bhi isamen bhoomika nibhaa rahi hai kyonki muslim netaaon kii najar bhavishya se voton par bhi he
 The reaction is different in areas where Muslim candidates have benefited from polarization of votes
 vahiin, loksabhaa saansad or ol india majalis-e-ittehadul muslimin (eiemiem) ke adhyaksh asaduddin ovaisi kii pratikriya aashaa ke anuroop he
 Talking to the media in Hyderabad on the day of the judgment, he said, "the Supreme Court is supreme but it is not as if there can be no mistake
" ise insaaf kaa majaak kahen yaa jo bhi kahen, par supreme court ne unheen logon ko ek trust banaakar mandir banane kii jimmedaari saunp di he jinhone 1992 main babari masjid ko dhwast kar diya tha
 Had the mosque not been demolished in 1992, what would the Supreme Court have ruled? Muslims of India believe in the constitution; We were fighting for our legal rights
 musalmaan garib ho sakate hai or unke saath bhedbhaav kiya ja saktaa he, par baavjood iske ve upi main 5 acre jameen par ek masjid kaa nirmaan khud kar sakane main sakasham hai
 We do not need a bailout
 mujhe vyaktigat taur par lagata he ki 5 acre jameen ke is prastaav ko nahin swikaarna chahie
 Others may realize that electoral polarization on issues such as the Ram temple has damaged their political prospects as Muslim representation in Parliament has declined following the Babri Masjid demolition
 pichley do loksabhaa chunaav is dharna ko bal dete hai
 Congress MLA Aftab Ahmed of Nuh says, "the court's verdict should be accepted
" koi bhi kanoon se upar nahin he, par faisle se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki usamen samjhauta kiya gaya he
 Well, people should now move beyond this issue
 ''vaise koi bhi sunishchit nahin he ki iske baad kya vibhaajankaree raajnneeti ruk jaaegi
 Abdul Bari Siddiqui, a senior RJD leader and former leader of opposition in the Bihar Assembly, says, "there is also a concern among Muslims that some parties have always polarized people on religious grounds for electoral gains
" ve aisa vivaad kisi duusari jagah par shuru kar sakate hai
 The end of religious polarization will mean the end of their petty politics
 isliye ve apana ullu sidhaa karne ke liye phir se kisi nai jagah par vivaad ko hawa de sakate hai
 We will not have to allow this to happen anywhere
 '' to kya aage bhi aisi jang hogi?—saath main romita datta, malik e
 Hashmi, of Amarnath
 menon or ashish mishra''ise insaaf kaa majaak kahen yaa jo bhi kahen, par supreme court ne unheen logon ko ek trust banaakar mandir banane kii jimmedaari saunp di he jinhone 1992 main babari masjid ko dhwast kiya tha''asaduddin ovaisiloksabhaa saansad or eiemiem pramukh''yah maamla jameen ke malikane se judaa tha or supreme court ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki sahi maalik koun he
 We believe that the mosque is the property of God; Muslims cannot own it '' Mufti Abdul Qasim nomaniwais-chancellor, Darul Uloom Deoband '' i have always been in favor of building a Ram temple at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi
 babari masjid ko ek shiya, mir baaki ne banaaya tha
 Therefore, the land should have been given to us instead of the Sunni Waqf Board
 "wasim Rizvi Cheerman, Shia Central Waqf Board" The Muslim community believes that the decision is more political than legal

 Bypassing the opposition of (DU) Vice Chancellor Dinesh Singh, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has ordered DU to resume the three-year undergraduate program by finishing the disputed four-year undergraduate program (FYUP) and enrolling from today
 Let the process begin
 ujisi ne buudhvaar raat kaha ki dilli vishvavidhyalay ke kai pratishthit collejon samet adhiktar ne uske nirdesh ko maan liya he
 The UGC repeated its order on a day when DU media coordinator Malay Nirav sent an SMS to media persons stating that the Vice Chancellor has resigned
 haalanki, kulapati ke samarthakon ne baad main is khabar ko nakaar diya
 After this both the Vice Chancellor and the Media Coordinator could not be contacted for a long time and later Nirav made an SMS to the media late in the night clarifying that the Vice Chancellor has not resigned

 Will bjp's win in UP civic elections clear the way for Ram temple construction? Will the obstacles of construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya be cleared now? On the one hand, this matter is in the Supreme Court, on the other hand the BJP MP has given rise to new speculation by linking bjp's victory in the body elections with Ram Mandir
 isse pehle yogi ne ayodhya main diwali ke din puja kar bhagwaan ram kaa aashirwad liya tha, lekin aaj ayodhya kii janata ne bhi nikaay chunaav main bijepi pratyaashee ke maathe par jeet kaa tikaa lagaakar yogi kii jholii bhar di

 Though the politics of development versus rigging is going on with the bjp's victory in Ayodhya, but in the eyes of BJP MP Subramanian Swamy, there is a wave of Ram temple behind this victory
 swami kaa yah bhi daawa he ki agle saal diwali main ram mandir nirmaan kaa kaam shuru ho jayega
 Ever since the command of UP has come into the hands of the people, since then the agitation for construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya has intensified

 unhone kaha ki saat vidhayak sarkaar ko samarthan de rahe hai
 Whatever the situation is, it should be cleared
 kyonki unka bhavishya is sarkaar par hi nirbhar he
 At the same time, a proposed meeting on tea between Digvijay Singh and Umang Singhar is also unlikely
 digvijay ne singhar ko patr likhaa tha, jisamen unhone milane kaa samay maanga tha
 In response, the forest minister had said that the former chief minister is welcome on 4 September
 iske jawaab main digvijay singh ne kaha ki ve 6 sitambar ko waapas bhopal lautenge
 Singhar wrote to Digvijay that you are welcome on 6 September as well

 Lies are a term we all hate
 lekin phir bhi ham sabhi ne apane jivan main kabhi na kabhijuthjarur bolaa hoga
 However, the reasons for everyone's lies are quite different from each other
 inamen sabase dilachasp baat ye he ki psychology ke mutabik, apanejuthko maananaa logon ke liye sabase mushkil hota he
 But we are telling you some special tips so that you will be able to easily catch the lies told by others
 aise pakad sakate hai logon kaa jhooth-1
 When a person lies, he talks his voice out of the ordinary
 jabaki sach bolne vaala vyakti aaraam se baat karata he
 However, you cannot say with certainty whether someone is lying to you or not, but it can definitely be guessed
 2
 When a person tells a lie, he insists on his words more than his body to believe his lies
 kaha jaataa he ki jhooth bolne waalon kibodimein zyada movement nahin hota he
 3
 agar aap kisi ke jhooth ko pakadana chaahate hai to koshish karen ki jhooth bolne vaale shaks se jaldi-jaldi ek ke baad ek sawaal karte rahen
 It is easy to lie but difficult to hide lies
 lagaataar sawaal karne se jhooth bolne vaale shaks par pressure badhegaa or us shaks ke munh se ghabaraakar galati se sach nikal hi jayega
 4
 sabhi jaanate hai ki jhooth bolte vakt log saamne vaale kiankhonmen ankhen daalkar nahin dekhte
 That is why the person who is lying to you can prove himself right and put his eyes in your eyes and say it
 expartka kahana ki jo shaks sach bolta he wo behad shant swabhaav se aapaki ankhon main dekhakar bolta he, jabaki jhooth bolne vaala shaks jabardastee ankhon main dekhne kii koshish karata he
 5
 agar koi shaks lambey samay tak aapse baat karata he to aap saamne vaale shaks ke dimag ko padhane ke sakasham hote hai
 a lying person tries to forcefully give an expression, which can be used to find out how true and how false a person is

 Incidents of chain snatching and purse snatching are coming to the fore
 taaja maamla kadakadduma chowk kaa he
 Where the bike riders escaped by snatching the purse of a woman returning home from Dobdamshoffis
 lut kii yah vaardaat beeti shaam 39 varshiya rekha ke saath hui
 Actually Rekha stays with family in DDA flat of Karkardooma
 vah dwarka main privet naukari karti hai
 She was returning home from office last evening
 shaam ke kareeb 6 baje rekha kadakadduma metro stesan se nikalakar paidal ghar kii ore ja rahi thim
 At that time, two young men riding bikes at Karkardooma Chowk came to them and ran away towards the Cross River Mall with their hands seperated
 rekha ke purse main atm, sijiechaes card, mobile phone, kuch sau rupee or anya saamaan tha
 The woman also made a noise at the time of the incident but by then the crooks had escaped from there
 is sambandh main anand vihaar police stesan par cese darj kiya gaya he
 Talked with many big contractors in the PVC market
 sabakaa kahana tha ki puraane saamaan par un logon ko 12 se lekar 18 pratishat tak jiesti dena padataa he jisaki vajah se un logon kii nuksaan ho rahaa he
 The goods are not selling further
 kuch logon ne yah bataaya ki nae juuton ke upar paanch pratishat kaa jiesti he or jab ye juute puraane ho jate or ricycling ke liye depo aate hai to us par 18 pratishat jiesti dena padataa he
 The question also arises that if these people are not giving GST from their pocket then how are they being harmed
 agar ye log purana maal kharidne main jiesti dete hai to aage in saamaanon ko jab ricycling karne vaali industry ko bechate hai to unase bhi jiesti lete hai or ricycling industry vaale apane saamaan ke upar jiesti lagaakar logon ko bechate hai
 So here you can say that GST is giving the common man, then the recycling industry, how are the contractors causing damage to these people
 darasal mazra yah he ki jiesti ke vajah se nae saamaanon ke daam kam hue hai or ricycling se bane saamaanon ke daam bad gaya he
 The rate of new goods and recycled salmon has almost come to a close, due to which people are buying new goods and sales of recycled goods have come down
 agar ricycling se bana saamaan nahin bik rahaa he to ricycling ke liye jo puraane saamaanon kii istemaal hota tha unki demand kam ho gai he
 If the recycling industry has reduced inventories, then contractors have also reduced collection of goods from junk, which has led to junkies having to deposit their goods and sell them for less money
 aap yah kah sakate hai ki jab demand kam ho gai he to daam kam ho gaye hai
 Actually, the reason is that due to GST, the prices of new goods have come down and the prices of goods made from recycling have gone up
 nae saamaan or ricycling ke bane saaman kaa rate lagbhag aasapaas pahunch gaya he jisaki vajah se log nae saamaan kharid rahe hai or ricycling se bane saamaanon kii bikri kam ho gai he
 If the goods made from recycling are not selling, then the demand for the old goods used for recycling has reduced
 agar ricycling industry ne maal lenaa kam kar diya he to thekedaaron ne bhi kabadiyon se maal lenaa kam kar diya he, jisaki vajah se kabadiyon ko apana maal ko jamaa karnaa pad rahaa or kam paise main bechnaa pad rahaa he
 You can say that when the demand has reduced, the prices have come down

 So, let me quickly tell you how this city which has made a mark in the country and world on the basis of its textile trade? How can i say that based on the amount of understanding i have seen in two days, this city It is now in the form of adolescence from boyhood

 The bike tilts till late at night
 agar aap yahaan kisi se kehete hai ki subah 6 baje milte hai to saamne vaala kahata he - aaraam se milte hai naa? nau baje ke aasapaas
 The city has trades, but the streets are not very cramped
 bechaini nahin he
 Speak sweet to each other
 agar kisi bike vaale ne car main kharonch maar di to sadak par mahabharat shuru nahin hota
 i am saying this on the basis of my two days of experience and the conversations i have had with people living here for months
 chunavi mausam he, lekin, sadakon par chalate hue yaa chauraahon se guzarate hue iskaa andaja nahin hota he
 As has been felt from northern India, especially Bihar and UP
 kai kaaran honge iske, ek kaaran yah dikhaa ki netaaon ke poster chauraahon par nahin lage hai
 Yesterday, i saw the first poster and that too of his head servant
 aakhir main wo baat, jo sheershak main likhaa he
 He went to Pipalodha around 10 pm on Sunday night
 piplodh ko aap aise samajhen ki yah dilli kaa seepi bazaar he yaa aap jis shahar main rahete hai, vahaan kaa sabase viksit, char-fer ilaaka
 i felt most amazed to see that the people here were seen eating and drinking easily along the road with their family
 street lite main padhane vaale logon ke bare main to suna tha, lekin is lite main logon ko apana raatri khaanaa khate hue dekhne kaa yah meraa pehla anubhav tha
 The atmosphere was complete family
 lekin, isse thodi dur par maahaul bilkul ulat mila
 The wide road was not as wide as it was before coming here
 street lite thi, lekin waisi jaise kamare main jiro vat kaa balb jal rahaa ho
 In this light, there were many two-wheelers, one by one on the road side and mostly adjacent to the two-wheeler, there was a loving atmosphere in its roof
 koi poochne vaala nahin
 No one is staring
 meraa maananaa he ki jo shahar prem ko lekar itnaa sahaj ho use duniya kii koi bhi takat sukhi hone se, khushmijaaj hone se nahin roak saktaa
 It is the same with Surat
 yahaan prem par paharaa nahin he
 There is no janitor

 com / i6c7rhmevj — Reece Smyth (@usambireland) June 5, 2019 a 'peace camp' was set up at Shannon Airport, where people opposed Trump's tour of Ireland, particularly on issues related to environmental change
 bataa den ki isse pehle yues raashtrapati kii yatra kaa virodh landan main bhi hua
 There, people had opposed Donald Trump by wearing the Trump Baby Balloon

 In Barrackpore, the gathering of BJP President Rajnath Singh has enthusiasm only in the name of Modi
 bijepi kaa jhanda fahraata dikh rahaa he
 Electoral advertisements in Hindi on the walls indicate that there is a strong emphasis on hindi-urdu speakers in this area
 kareeb 40 fisadi matadaata muslim hai
 a large number of people from bihar-jharkhand have also settled
 logon main bijepi ke prati ek utsukata he
 The attraction of Modi's name is drawing him to Rajnath Singh's meetings even in this scorching sun
 lekin kya bijepi ko siten milengi? is sawaal par kareeb-kareeb sabhi kaa ek jaisaa hi jawaab he- ikkaa-dukka siten jeetne kii sthiti main hi he bijepi
 However, BJP leaders themselves claim that apart from Darjeeling, this time BJP can win in some other constituencies due to the star candidates
 khaastaur se babul supriyo, bappi lahiri or jorge baker par party kii ummiden tiki hai
 The BJP feels that Modi's name and the glow of these stars will probably benefit him
 lekin bengal main mamata kaa jaadu chal rahaa he
 In the name of change, different things are happening on the task of three years of Mamta forming the government by showing the door to the left parties
 par abhi yah saboot nahin milte ki mamata se logon kaa moh bhang hona shuru hua ho
 Mamta is contesting in the name of development of Bengal
 modi ko 'gujarat kaa kasaai' bolkar unki party ne khud ko bijepi ke saamne khadaa kar liya he
 Mamta Banerjee's party has spurred Narendra Modi's statement of expelling Bangladeshi infiltrators
 rajnath singh apane bhaashanon main modi ke bayaan par safai dete hai
 It is said that he was referring to the illegally infiltrated Bangladeshis
 bijepi or trinmul ke bich hui bayanon kii garmi par bhi rajnath pani daalane kii koshish karte hai
 He says that if the Modi government comes to Delhi, work will be started to give a special package to West Bengal
 yah mamata banerjee kii mahatvapurn maang he
 But Rajnath also targets Mamata for not taking steps for the development of the state
 mamata ko lekar bijepi kii ek duvidha bhi he
 Earlier, Mamta Banerjee was also a minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government
 us sarkaar ke apana kaarykaal puraa karne main mamata kii badi bhoomika bhi rahi thi
 If the NDA stays away from the majority in the May 16 results, it may need support from Jayalalithaa, Mamta and Naveen Patnaik
 2016 main pashchim bengal main vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai or aise main yah sambhaavna kam hi he ki mamata khulkar modi ke saath aaen
 But in the name of special packages, the option to seek support from them on the basis of conditions can be kept open
 vaise to bengal main chaar partiyon main muqabla he
 Trinamool and Left are traditional opponents
 congress or bijepi bhi apni ore se dam maarthe rahe hai
 But Modi's campaign and Trinamool's constant attacks on BJP are giving the impression that the contest is happening between BJP and Trinamool
 jabaki hakeekat main aisa nahin he
 It is sure that the left front has not recovered from the 2011 defeat
 na hi logon main is loksabhaa chunaav main use vot dene ke liye koi uthkanthaa he
 But making this election a match between Trinamool versus BJP is favorable for both parties
 bijepi ko lagata he ki pichley teen saal main mamata ke khilaaf jo log hue hai, ve bajaae left ke use vot de sakate hai
 That is why in the speeches of Narendra Modi, there is a sharp target on Mamta rather than the left
 ek bijepi netaa to bad-chadh kar yahaan tak kehete hai ki bengal main jo sthiti left kii thi, vah aaj mamata kii he
 And what Mamta did was that of BJP
 jabaki modi or bijepi par hamalaa karne se mamata ko apane muslim matadaataaon ko saath lene main madad milti he
 Along with the Left, she also attacks Congress and BJP and gives this message that she is not taking it too seriously
 left partiyon ke netaa ise bijepi or trinmul ke bich nura-kushti bataate hai
 Although many people agree that the BJP may not win more seats in West Bengal in this election, but its vote percentage will increase tremendously in the name of Modi
 ram janmabhumi andolan ke vakt bijepi ko rajya main 12 fisadi vot mili the
 This time this figure will definitely be exceeded
 rajya main bijepi kaa sanghathan kamazor he
 The party has support in the marwari-gujarati section here
 is baar anya rajyon se aae logon main bhi modi kaa jaadu chalata dikh rahaa he
 BJP leaders remind the people of Bengal that Jana Sangh was founded by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee of Bengal itself
 iske baavjood bengal main dada or didi kaa vikalp banane ke liye modi ko lanbaa safar tay karnaa he

 He also accused Kejriwal of cheating Anna Hazare

 sarkaar ne shuukravaar ko sansad se khan or khanij bill (mining bill) ke saath-saath koyala bill bhi paas kara liya, lekin bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon ko lekar uski mushkilen bani hui hai
 While the government is talking about opening avenues for auction of minerals like bauxite and iron ore through the mining bill, it says that the coal blocks auction will be easier with the passing of the coal bill
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki donon bilon paas hona behatar disha main ek kadam he or isse khanijon kii nilaamee ek paardarshee tareeke se ho sakegi
 The government did not have the numbers in the Rajya Sabha for these disputed bills, but ultimately managed to convince many opposition parties
 - keval congress or vampanthi partiyon ne hi mining bill kaa virodh kiya
 - While the Congress and the Left also supported the DMK on the coal bill
 - trinmul congress, samaajawaadee party, bispi or bijedy donon bilon (koyala or mining) par sarkaar ke saath raheen
 - While JDU walked out of the House on both bills

 On the other hand, the government is describing these bills as successful, but during the debate in the House, the Congress and the Left repeatedly said that the new coal bill will allow private companies to sell coal in the open market and this will violate the rights of workers and tribals
 congress or left ne ye bhi kaha ki mining bill ke praavdhaan rajyon ke adhikaron kaa hanan karte hai or is kanoon ko adaalat main chunauti di jaaegi
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh said that the mining bill is unconstitutional in the current form and it will definitely be challenged in the court

 unhone gutp tareeke se kiya hoga, jaise hi hamen pataa chalegaa, ham uchit karrwai karenge
 The Sabarimala temple in Kerala has been closed for purification rituals
 vahiin, kerala ke siem pinaraai vijayan ne kaha ki aaj, do mahilaon ne sabarimala mandir main pravesh kiya
 We had issued standing orders to the police to provide all possible protection to any woman who wishes to enter the temple: tell us that earlier around December 24, Tamil Nadu, who wanted to see Lord Ayyappa at the Sabarimala temple, a group of 11 women were forced to abandon the yatra when protesters turned violent
 is dauraan police ne do darjan pradarshnakariyon ko hiraasat main liya tha
 This group of women was led by Salvi, who belongs to the Maniti Women's Group of Tamil Nadu
 bhakton dwaara pahari par chadhane se unhen rokane or bhagane par in mahilaon ko pamba se madurai ke liye waapas jane ko baadhya hona padaa
 Hindu groups in Sabarimala have been continuously protesting against this decision since the Supreme Court decided on September 28 to allow women of every age group to enter the temple
 unka kahana he ki yah faisla dharmik parampara ke khilaaf he
 On September 28, 2018, the Supreme Court passed the historic verdict allowing women of all ages to enter Kerala's Sabarimala temple
 supreme court ne apane faisle main saaf kaha ki har umr varg kii mahilaayein ab mandir main pravesh kar sakengi
 The Supreme Court had said that the place of woman in our culture is respected
 yahaan mahilaon ko devi kii tarah puja jaataa he or mandir main pravesh se roka ja rahaa he
 This is not acceptable

 In the Congress party, Sonia Gandhi has now handed over the command to Rahul Gandhi, Rahul himself seems to be leading on every important occasion of the party, Sonia has gone everywhere
 ab to bas mahaj rahul kii tajposhi ke aupchaarik elaan kaa intazaar he, lekin sonia se rahul ko ho rahi zimmedaariyon ke transfar main gandhi parivaar kaa ek or shaks badi bhoomika main aa chukaa he, jise congress ke kaaryakarta pyaar se pukaarte hai 'bhaiyya ji'
 Actually, Bhaiyya ji calls Congress workers Priyanka Gandhi, while the leaders call themselves Priyanka with 'PG'
 arase se amethi or raibareli main simit rahane vaali piji ab rashtriya str par sakriy ho chalin hai, bas parade ke baahar aana baaki he, varanaa notebandi se lekar netaaon kii party main jwining ho yaa phir chunaavon kii ranneeti congressiyon kii piji ab har jagah ahm bhoomika main hai
 The Congressmen themselves say that she does not have a name on any post and she does not appear in front of herself or else she is doing all that Rahul's important warlord should do
 parde ke peeche kaam kar raheen priyankahaal main notebandi par jab rahul sakriy hue or desh bhar main raily or pradarshan main vyast rahe to priyanka gandhi hi parade ke peeche kaman sanbhale raheen
 She continued to formulate strategy for Rahul by holding meetings with leaders like Ahmed Patel, Mallikarjun Kharge, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Oscar Fernandez
 priyanka khud bade netaaon se milteen or phir baad main rahul samet bade netaa baaqi netaaon ko brif kar dete
 Recently, the Congress announced a massive protest against demonetisation on January 5, but when he went to Priyanka for consent, Priyanka changed her date by one day, because the important program of Sikhs on the 5th
 Was
 vaise to notebandi par congress kii bani cameti main chairman ahamed patel or ko chairman auskar furnandis hai, kisi faisle ke jari hone par dastakhat ahamed patel ke hote hai, lekin usase pehle final apruval priyanka hi karti hai
 It can be said that for the party, brother Rahul is engaged in the field work of politics, Tobhan Priyanka is executing the strategy in the closed room like a party and brother for Chanakya
 congress main jodi kaa kamalwaise isse pehle bhi congress main gandhi parivaar kii jodi yun hi sakriy rahi he, nehru ke daur main indira thim, indira ke daur main pehle sanjay or baad main rajeev, rajeev ke daur main arun nehru, sonia ke daur main rahul aa gaye or ab rahul ke daur main priyanka qadam badha raheen hai
 Although the pair of close relations always remained in the Gandhi family, but Rajiv Gandhi's time was slightly different when close relatives were Arun Nehru and later Arun himself turned against Rajiv
 unheen arun nehru ke khilaaf 1999 main raibareli main priyanka ne satish sharma ke liye chunaav prachaar karte hue kaha tha ki kya aap log us aadmi ko vot karenge, jisane mere pita kii peeth par chhura ghonpa tha or arun nehru chunaav haar gaye the
 Will Priyanka's magic outweigh Rahul? This new experiment makes the party feel that there is an advantage, who kept feeling comfortable with Congress leader Sonia, but could not sit with her chemistry with Rahul, she went through Priyanka's role in the party
 By getting active, the party will only benefit
 lekin do power centre banane kii surat main party ko phayda hoga yaa nuksaan, ye to bhavishya ke hi gart main he
 After all, why Priyanka is not coming out of the screen, behind this, the section of party leaders believes that Priyanka's charisma will be overshadowed by Rahul's shine
 isiilie wo pehle rahul ko party ke number ek netaa ke taur par sthapit karnaa chaahatin hai, khud sirf unke sahyogi kii bhoomika main rahanaa chaahati hai, uske baad sahi vaqt aane par wo khud khule aam sakriy ho jaaengi, lekin iskaa faisla khud priyanka or gandhi parivaar legaa

 ab aapako is aam jan kaa dayera samajhnaa hoga, tabhi sanskrit kaa vistaar samaj sakenge
