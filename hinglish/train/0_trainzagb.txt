 There is confusion about the proposed release date of Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film Padmavati
 sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki film 12 janvari ke din relies hogi
 It was to be released on 1 December
 haalanki padmavati ke mekars ne date aage badhane kii baat se inkaar kiya he
 Viacom18 COO Ajit Andhare, one of the makers of Padmavati, called the news of Padmavati's release TED slipping forward baseless
 vaise film ke nirmaataaon kii ore se sensor board ko jo document bheje gaye the usamen kai tarah kii khamiyaan hai
 The release of the film is proposed nationwide on December 1 by the makers
 sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki mekars kii ore se aaj (17 november) sensor board ko copy saunpi gai he
 Sources told India Today, 'the original documents sent by the Padmavati Makers to the censors are incomplete
 film kii shuruyaat main bhi apekshit disclemur nahin he
 Certification of the film has been delayed due to lack of documentation
 'film ke talane kii ye ho sakati hai 2 badi vajahen # 1
 What is the rule of the censor board: Actually, according to the rules, a film has to be sent to the censor 15 days before the release for certification
 film kii pehali copy kaa kaam puraa nahin hua tha
 Because of this it was not sent to the sensor
 film 17 november ko hi sensor ke paas bheji gai he
 The proposed date of sending the film to the board for release on December 1 has expired
 sensor ne niyam kaa paalan kiya to 1 disambar ko film kii relies par sankat he
 # 2
 film par jari vivaad :haalanki yah saaf nahin he lekin film par jari vivaad bhi relies date kii talane kii ek vajah ban sakate hai
 Political parties like Karni Sena and congress-bjp have raised objections to the film
 gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav or upi main nikaay chunaav ke maddenjar bijepi ne ise taalane kii maang kii gai thi
 The BJP had written a letter to the Election Commission demanding extension of the date
 sensor kaa maamla bataate hue ayog ne ise asweekaar kar diya tha
 Release date slips, so what next? # 1
 film ko lekar jari gatirodh kuch dinon ke liye kam hoga
 If the film is released after the Gujarat and UP civic elections, then the political parties may not have to face opposition
 # 2
 The movement under the leadership of Karni Sena and other Rajput organizations will weaken

 sensor chif ne nahin dekhi he filmasensor board chif prasoon joshi ne india today ko bataaya ki unhone abhi tak padmavati nahin dekhi he
 Such reports are lies, in which a private screening is being said to watch the film
 soochna or prasaaran mantri smriti irani ke najdiki sutron ne bhi kaha, kendriya mantri ne bhi aise kisi screening event main film nahin dekhi he
 Such discussions are unfounded
 'deepika ke saath intimet seen ke liye kuch bhi kar sakate hai ranvir singh'relies se pehle karani sena ko dikhaanaa chaahate hai filmasensor board sutron ne yah bhi bataaya ki mekars ne karani sena ko relies se pehle film dikhaane ke liye sensor board se anumati maangi he

 He was also the General Secretary of this party from 1969 to 1971
 1971 main is party ko praja socialist party se milakar ek nai socialist party (samta party) banaai gai
 George Fernandes, who fought the joint Socialist Party ticket, won 1,47,841 votes in the 1967 Lok Sabha elections, 48 of the total vote

 i believe that the best beauty of democracy is criticism
 modi sarkaar kii bharpoor aalochanahoni chahie, har prakaar se aalochana honi chahie
 This is where democracy thrives
 sarkaron or prashasan main baithe logon ko bhi ise saubhaahgya maananaa chahie
 Modi said that criticism is not my concern
 aalochana ke liye shodh or mehnat kerani padati he
 One has to go closely, figures and history have to be extracted
 aaj kisi ke paas itnaa samay hi nahin he
 Today it is quick to give breaking news to everyone

 Criticism is the biggest strength of democracy and the most destructive thing is accusations
 isliye aalochana ko puraskrit karnaa chahie or aaropon se bachane kii koshish kerani chahie
 If someone in the government gives me good news, i say that it is okay, tell me the lack of it
 agar main galtiyaan sunanaa band kar duungaa to apni galtiyaan kaise sudhaaruunga
 Your criticism is gold mine for me, it is treasure
 aaj main jahaan pahunchaa hum mujhe bahut logon ne banaaya he
 Many people have cured me by being beaten up

 He said that development does not happen with a sense of satisfaction

 darasal ames ne apni report main jin chah tarah ke jaharon kaa hawala dekar kaha tha ki unki jaanch bharat main nahin ho sakati, unamem metalik radioective jehar thallium or polonium bhi hai
 Experts, however, believe that after a year, the identification of poison is impossible in any lab in the world
 kareeb 25,000 hajaar postmortem report taiyaar kar chuke jane maane forencik export ke el sharma kaa kahana he ki agar doctoron ko yah shaq he ki kisi ke sharir main metalik radioective jehar ho saktaa he to postmortem ke vakt hi sharir ke eksre ke jariye isaki pahchaan ho sakati he, lekin visra sample lene ke baad is tarah kaa jehar dhire dhire sample se khatm ho jaataa he or phir duniya kii koi bhi forencik lab isaki jaanch nahin kar sakati
 According to experts, the most important poisons in the world are Corosive, Metallic, Somniferous, Vegetable and Venom
 kai baar alag-alag dawaaen kha lene se bhi zehar ban jaataa he
 Thallium and polonium can be examined by X-ray at the time of post-mortem
 lekin ames ke doctoron ne aisa nahin kiya is baat par bhi sawaal uth rahe hai ki sunanda pushkar sareekhee hyprophile hasti ke visra jaanch main ek saal kaise lag gaya
 Renowned medico legal expert RL Sharma says that Sunanda's viscera first went to CFSL for investigation, there are questions about how much his viscera sample will be and how it will be, he says that if the investigation of viscera sample is delayed too much So many types of poisons disappear on their own and many such viscera reports have come in Delhi, whose results were not found
 sharma kehete hai ki ek visra sample kii jaanch main mahaj 3 ghante lagate hai
 They do not understand why it took a year to investigate the viscera in a high profile case like Sunanda
 itnaa hi nahin forencik export ashanka jataa rahe hai ki agar sunanda ko zehar diya gaya to koi bina swaad or bina gandh vaale zehar ko khilaayaa gaya hoga injection ke istemaal kii sambhaavna kam lagati he kyonki injection se jehar dene ke liye kai logon kii jarurat hogi
 KL Sharma says that it is necessary to take a sample of Sunanda's tooth which has a bite mark on it, because both can be matched by taking impressions of the teeth of those who come under suspicion, but in this case i have not done anything like this

 jindagi ne aaj surabhi ko ek doraahe par laakar khadaa kar diya he
 He does not understand whether he is happy or sad today
 yaaden samay kii dahalij langhakar vartmaan main jo daakhil hone ko hai
 
 
 And in such a situation, she is unable to take a decision whether she has made a mistake by including yesterday in the past? Rahul
 
 
 yahi to thi uski jindagi
 Both of them had dreams of a beautiful future together
 lekin, na jane kyon unki raahen alag ho gayi
 Although Surabhi has moved a lot, but the tightness of the past has been with her today
 beete saal bhar se donon ke bich na koi baat hui, na koi mulaakaat
 But today suddenly Rahul gets a call
 milane kii ichha jataai usne
 Surabhi does not know how she agreed
 lekin, ab wo apane is faisle ko lekar pasopesh main he
 Actually, this story may not be of Surabhi alone, but of thousands of girls
 in halaat main nervas hona lajimi he, saath hi itane saare sawaalon kaa jehan main aana bhi
 But, at this juncture one should listen more than the heart
 dhairya rakhen or jaldbaaji main koi bhi faisla lene se bachein
 Remember, don't expect too much from this meeting
 saavdhaanee se karen mulaakaat kaa nirnayakya aap vaaki usase milanaa chaahati hai
 Is the reason the two of you separated still exists
 agar in sab sawaalon ke jawaab ko lekar aap santusht nahin hai, to behatar hoga ki aap unhen saaf manaa kar den
 Do not take any decision with doubt in heart
 mood ko rakhen 'lite'milakar baithen bhi or baat na ho, isse acha he ki aisi mulaakaat hi na ho
 Yes, if you meet and you cannot talk, then what is the use of meeting? ek swasth mulaakaat ke liye swasth maahaul kaa hona jaruri he
 Take this as an opportunity
 ateet kaa boj lekar na milen
 This makes the atmosphere cumbersome
 aise avasar par maahaul kuch asahaj ho saktaa he, khaskar agar aapaki mulaakaat kaaphi dinon baad ho rahi ho, lekin apni ore se is mulaakaat ko sahaj or 'lite' rakhane kaa hi prayaas karen
 If the meeting is short, then better keep your meeting small
 bhale hi aapke paas kaaphi kuch kyon na ho kehane ko
 But, keep this 'maiden' meeting 'short and sweet'
 agar baat or mulaakaat sakaaratmak rahi ho, to phir aage bhi mila ja saktaa he
 But, yes, keep the next meeting after a while
 adhuurepan kaa ehsaas na karavaaenunhen kabhi apane ekaakipan kaa ahsaas na karavaaen
 Even if you were missing them, keep a check on your feelings
 bahut sambhav he ki vah ise aapaki kamajori maan le or aapako kamjor sabit nahin hona he
 Try to be normal
 Don't behave 'over'
 zyada dostana bhale hi na hon, lekin zyada khinche-khinche rahanaa bhi sahi nahin
 Undue anger and arguing will not achieve anything
 jo biit gaya, use badla nahin ja saktaa, usase bas sabak liya ja saktaa he

 narendra modi ke sadbhaavna upwas main unki chhavi melmilaap vaale netaa ke rup main pesh karne kii koshish kii gai
 The Chief Minister of Gujarat interacted with Senior Editor Uday Mahurkar
 usee ke kuch anshamukhyamantri ke rup main kya yah aapkaa antim kaarykaal he?main parade ke peeche rahane vaala party kaaryakarta rahaa hum
 i never dreamed of becoming Chief Minister, but the people of Gujarat not only made me Chief Minister but also gave me a lot of love
 gujarat kii seva karke main aadhyatmik sukh praapt karata hum
 i find myself completely immersed in it
 gujarat main aapane bahut kar liya? kya ab bharat aawaaj de rahaa he?gujarati bharat kii 120 karod janata kaa ang hai
 Serving Gujarat means serving Mother India
 donon ke bich fark karnaa anuchit he
 It is believed that the biggest opposition to the idea of prime Minister Modi is being held in your own party rather than outside
 kyon?yah sawaal kaalpanik, yahaan tak ki nihit arthon vaala or durbhagyapurna bhi he
 Those same leaders prepared me and i am because of what i am today
 maine unase kai baaten sikhi hai
 It is sad for me that no one thinks about them in this way
 aapke teen din ke upwas ne kya badlaav kiya he?desh kii satta ke galiyaaron main gujarat ke vikaas model ke bare main charchaaen chal rahi thim, par aisa dabi jabaan main hi ho rahaa tha
 When the US government published positive comments about the rule of Gujarat, more people came to know about it
 main sadbhaavna mishan par chalakar duniya ko yah bataanaa chahta tha ki hamaari vikaas yatra shanti, sadbhaav or bhaichaare par aadhaarit he
 i wanted those who admired Gujarat to know the spirit behind him
 aapane kaha ki vikaas se sambandhit aapkaa sadbhaavna model ek roj bharat main vot bank kii raajnneeti par aadhaarit vikaas ko samaapt kar degaa
 What do you mean by this? If you look at the last 40 years of India, you will find that the ruling parties have prepared their budgets to strengthen the vote banks
 unhone aise model taiyaar kiye jinase log sarkaar par nirbhar ho gaye
 But in Gujarat we rejected the model based on vote bank politics and created a new model based on the slogan 'sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'
 log vikaas main bhagidaar ban gaye hai
 And progress is not in pieces but in form
 meraa puraa vishwaas he ki sadbhaavna or janashakti is desh main vot bank kii raajnneeti ko khatm kar degi
 Despite all your efforts, you remain a polarizing force rather than a unifying leader
 aisa kyon he?jab maine pad sambhala to kai logon ko laga ki main sarkaar chalaane ke liye bahut anubhavheen hum lekin aaj ve hi log kehete hai ki maine khud ko khara sabit kar diya he
 So, opinions can change over time
 lekin bharat main bauddhik samarthy ke saath nihit swaarth vaala ek samooh he jo sardaar patel, morarji desai, atal ji, adwani ji or ab meraa virodh karata aa rahaa he
 So it is not fair to assume that i am a polarizing person
 kya aap bihar ke nitish kumaar ko pradhanmantri ke rup main sweekaar karenge?raashtra faisla karegaa ki pradhanmantri koun banegaa
 Whoever becomes Prime Minister will have to accept me as a citizen
 kya aapako lagata he ki sushasan kaa record hi aapako rashtriya netaa banane ke liye paryaapt he?donon chijen alag-alag hai

 bijepi ko haryana main milin 40 sitbijepi ne diya tha 75 paar kaa narakai morchon par pichad gaye CM khatterloksabhaa chunaav main haryana kii janata ne bijepi ko jitani shiddat ke saath sabhi 10 siten jitakar bheja, usase laga ki vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bhagava party kaa jaadu chalegaa
 The factionalism of the Congress and the splitting of the INLD gave a further boost to the bjp's spirits and the party gave the slogan of 75 crosses this time
 yahaan tak ki pradhanmantri narendra modi jab vidhansabha chunaav prachaar main utre to unhone kaha ki wo haryana kabhi vot maangane nahin aate, janata khud hi unhen aashirwad de detii he
 That is, the confidence was very high
 guuruuvaar (24 oktober) ko jab asal rigelt aae to bijepi ko niraashaa haath lagi
 Tiktok stars, wrestlers and wrestlers, politics also lost
 nateeja ye hua ki 75 paar to dur party bahumat kaa aankada (46 seat) tak nahin chhu pai or sarkaar banane ke laale pad gaye
 In such a situation, questions are arising as to what were the factors in Haryana that overshadowed the big electoral and nationalist issue like Article 370 and the BJP had to settle for fewer seats than expected
 in binduon par kamjor pad gaye khatter-aarakshan naa milane par jaaton kaa gussa-dalit-musalamaanon kaa virodh-deraa sachcha sauda ke anuyaayiyon kii naaraazgi-sthaneey muddon kii jagah rashtriya masalon par jor-berogari or aarthik sankat-khatter sarkaar kaa pradarshan-management main kamiharyana: wo paanch vidhayak jinaki baghawat ne BJP se chin liya bahumatye wo ahm mudde hai, jinke kaaran mana ja rahaa he ki khatter sarkaar or bijepi ko pratyaashit nateezon se maharoom rahanaa padaa he
 In Maharashtra, the Fadnavis government worked to fulfill the demand for Maratha reservation, but when it came to reservation for Jats in Haryana, BJP could not do anything here
 2014 main tamaam netaaon ko darkinar kar manohar laal khatter ko mukhyamantri kii kaman saunpna pehle se hi jaaton ke bich naaraazgi kaa bada kaaran rahaa
 On the other side was Congress veteran and big Jat leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who continued to contest on local issues
 hooda jaaton ko prabhavit karne main kaamyaab rahe or rohtak, sonipat va sirsa jaise jaaton ke garh main congress ne shandaar pradarshan kiya
 In the matter of weakening the law related to jat-dalit-muslim Factor Dalits, the Modi government at the center had to face opposition from Dalits all over the country
 haryana main bhi iskaa khaasaa asar najar aayaa
 Jats, Dalits and Muslims make up about 50 percent of Haryana's population
 rajya vidhansabha kii kareeb 55 siten aisi hai, jahaan jaaton or daliton kii aabaadi 40 fisadi se zyada he
 To woo this big vote bank, the Congress waged to make a Dalit state president in the form of Kumari Selja and contested in the face of Hooda, a Jat leader
 lihaaja, ye tamaam aise sameekaran bane jinhone daliton ko bijepi se dur kar congress kii taraf mode diya
 In the exit poll of Aaj tak-axis My India, it was also revealed that the Congress got more Dalit votes
 deraa anuyaayiyon kaa gussaharyana main deraa sachcha sauda pramukh gurmeet ram rahim ke anunaayiyon kii sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 During the Gurmeet Ram Rahim Khattar government, action was taken on the jail, their dera, which also showed the displeasure of the followers of the BJP government
 ye mudda puri tarah se sthaneey tha
 Article 370 made the biggest issue
 On the other hand BJP continued to raise the national issue like removal of Article 370 from Kashmir
 siem khatter ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki haryana chunaav kaa sabase bada mudda dhara 370 he
 On the other hand, Congress kept saying that the issues of Haryana are employment, economic crisis and farmers
 inhen muddon ke aadhaar congress khatter sarkaar ko gherti rahi
 However, despite slipping from the majority, the BJP is ready to form the government for the second consecutive time in Haryana on the strength of independents, but the task of delivering the BJP in this condition has been done by Bhupendra Singh Hooda and 30 year old Dushyant Chautala
 alag-alag morche par ladate hue donon ne aisa kamaal kiya ki booth prabandhan ke liye maahir samajhi jane vaali bijepi ko kahana padaa ki prabandhan main kami rah gai
 BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya has said that there was a lack of management in Haryana
 prastaavit jat andolan ravivaar se shuru hona tay hone ke bich sonipat ke jiladhikari ke makrand pandurang ne jile main mobile internet seva par roak lagane kaa aadesh jari kiya jo agle aadesh tak prabhavi rahegaa
 Anticipating the rumor spreading from the mobile internet service, the officer said that there was a possibility that the mobile internet services could be used to spread misinformation and rumors
 unhone kaha ki in sevaaon kaa istemaal avaidh gatividhiyon main bhi kiya ja saktaa tha jaise sadak, rajmarg or rail patariyaan avaruddha karnaa, sarkari sampatti ko kshatigrast karnaa or aavashyak seva evam khaadya aapurti baadhit karnaa
 The order to shut down the Internet service said that the social media such as whatsapp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, Google Plus and mobile internet can be misused for this purpose
 unhone kaha ki sabhi doorsanchaar companiyon ko in adeshon kaa sakhti se paalan karne kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 Meanwhile, the district administration of Rohtak has issued notices to four persons for violating Section 144 imposed in the district by putting up tents for picketing without the permission of the competent authority
 rohtak ke upayukta atul kumaar ne kaha ki gaanv jasia main kanhi chowk ke paas tent lagane ke liye notice rethal ke purv sarpanch umed singh, jasia nivasee somvir singh, dev colony ke ashok balhara or rohtak ke vijayadeep ko jari kiye gaye hai
 Permission was not taken from the administration to set up the tent
 in logon ko tatkaal tent hataane kanirdesh diya gayaahai
 They have been asked to provide clarification within two days
 unhone kaha ki sector chah sthit maidan ko dharne ke liye tay kiya gaya he
 All national and state highways, rail tracks and stations and link roads in the district have been prohibited from collecting more than five persons within 500 meters

 mayawati ne sapa ghoshnaa patr jari hone ke agle din aaj yahaan jari ek bayaan main kaha ki uttar pradesh main sattarudh sapa apane karnaamon se aam janata kaa vishwaas puri tarah kho chuki he
 As expected, he has made very promising promises but the public is not going to believe them now

 Yeddyurappa Thursday morning 9
 30 baje mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge
 However, the JDS and the Congress alliance have strongly objected to the Governor's decision
 vahiin karnataka kii is siyaasi sargarmi se hatakar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi un teen rajyon ke liye ranneeti banane main lage hue hai, jahaan is saal ke aakhir main chunaav hone hai or jahaan teenon rajyon main hi is vakt bijepi kii sarkaar hai
 The names of these states are Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan
 chhattisgarh se shuruatkarnataka ke pal-pal ke ghatnakram par najar rakhane ke saath hi rahul gandhi guuruuvaar 17 may se chhattisgarh ke do din ke daure par ja rahe hai
 Congress leaders say that the real contest between Congress and BJP has now started
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad jitne bhi rajyon main chunaav hue hai unamem gujarat or punjab ko chhodkar kahin bhi bijepi sattarudh nahin thi
 But elections are to be held later this year in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh where BJP is in power in all three states
 in teenon hi rajyon main congress or bijepi main muqabla hona he
 PL Punia, Congress in-charge for Chhattisgarh, told India Today, 'despite the party's performance in Karnataka, Brandrahul Gandhi has become stronger
 hamaara vot share karnataka main bijepi se zyada rahaa he
 The BJP is well aware that it is becoming difficult to answer the questions asked by Rahul Gandhi in the opposition camp

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi will also interact directly with the members of the booth committee along with participating in various party programs
 puniya ne kaha, ‘congress ke paas samarpit cader nahin tha jisaki vajah se 2014 loksabhaa chunaav or kuch rajyon ke chunaav main party ko bahut nuksaan hua
 This is the reason why Rahul Gandhi has instructed all the state in-charges and leaders that booth management and strengthening of the organization should be given top priority

 The secret of robbery brides became a headache for the police in Gujarat
 police ke mutabik soobe kii ladakiyon ko agava kar unhen luteri dulhan banaaya jaataa tha
 Then they were negotiated
 ahmedabad police ne in ladakiyon kaa giroh chalaane vaali ek mahila ko dhar dabocha he
 Which has been identified as Maya Sathavara
 usne gujarat kii kai ladakiyon ko duusare rajyon main bech daalaa
 Police have also arrested the accused woman Maya Sathavara along with her two colleagues Anand and Shailendra
 jo peshey se auto rickshaw chaalak hai
 It is alleged that both the accused used to bring the innocent bhali girls into the trap and brought them to Maya
 poochtacha ke dauraan un donon ne police ke saamne apana gunaah kubul kiya he
 Police found out that Maya had sold five girls from Gujarat
 jinamein se kuch ko maharashtra main bechaa gaya
 It is learned about the five girls that Maya sold them by pretending to be married
 magar police kaa kahana he ki is kaam ke liye maaya ko 10 hajaar rupee milte the
 However, this is not embracing the police itself
 aaropee mahila maaya ne gujarat kii 5 ladakiyon ko shaadi karne ke icchhuk logon ko tasviren dikhaakar bech diya tha
 This gang used to pretend to marry these girls in the name of an organization called Aryavrat Mangalam
 usne kai ladakiyon ke naam bhi badal daale
 These girls used to go to other people's homes in the name of marriage and after getting the opportunity cleaned their hands there
 phir badi safai se ye ladkiyaan vahaan se nikal jaati thi
 Police is now taking further action in this matter
 maharashtra main shivasena netaa sanjay raut or ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar se hui mulaakaat ke baad dilli tak halchal bad gai he
 The Shiv Sena appeared to be soft on the 50-50 formula from the BJP when Eknath Shinde was elected as the Legislature Party leader in the Legislature Party meeting
 kyonki uddhav thakare pehle bhi tay kar chuke hai ki shivasena kii ore se mukhyamantri aditya thakare hi honge
 But after Sanjay Raut's meeting with Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena's stance has become more strict
 aaj subah sanjay raut ne kaha ki maharashtra main bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane ko lekar koi baatcheet nahin ho rahi he or iske saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki maharashtra main aglaa mukhyamantri shivasena kii hoga
 So is Shiv Sena ready to form government with the support of NCP? But will the Shiv Sena agree to take the support of the Congress for this as well? For this, we also have to look at the past political events
 congress or shivasena main bhale hi gahare vaicharik matbhed rahe hon lekin mauka padane par donon dal ek saath aa chuke hai
 However, Hindutva was not on the Shiv Sena's agenda till the Ram Mandir movement and it remains to be seen whether Uddhav Thackeray, who had kept the tone of Ayodhya till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, will leave the BJP and support the Congress
 haalanki is baar maamla muddon kaa nahin, sarkaar banane kaa he

 diary ke mutabik, bhaatia parivaar ne 24 june se fande par latakane kii practice shuru kar di thi
 Lalit had assured the housemates that father Bhopal Singh Rathi, who had died 10 years ago, still comes home and talks to him
 fande par latakane se pehle puraa parivaar karata tha havanpractice ke dauraan fande par latakane se pehle puraa parivaar havan karata tha
 After this, the whole family used to hang on the traps according to the way written in the diary
 lekin haath, pair or munh ke khule hone ke kaaran sabhi batch jate the
 According to Delhi Police, several lines have been written in Lalit's diary on June 30, allegedly on the instructions of his father's soul
 isse jaahir hota he ki fande par latakane se pehle puure parivaar ko yakeen tha ki unhen bachaa liya jayega
 Actually, father's intention was to keep water in the cup
 jab pani rang badalegaa to main prakat hounga or tum sabko bachaa luungaa
 'father had said i will save everyone' It was allegedly Lalit's father's instruction that the way of God, there should be 9 captives on the net, baby on separate stool, mother separated, one person should do the work of binding, stool near the temple
 But the baby will climb, the mother will feed the bread, put a wet cloth in the mouth, the hands will be tied and bandage on the mouth, put a cotton to keep the ears closed, point with a fine stick, there will be action at one o'clock in the night, Saturday and Sunday
 Myani night's action, keep the water in the cup

 Before hanging, the family usually worshiped the entire Rathi family till 12 o'clock at night
 lekin 30 june kii raat ko ghar kaa har shaks jaag rahaa tha
 After walking Doggy Tommy, Lalit started preparing for special puja as soon as he returned home

Like mother, like daughter
 a post shared by Abhishek Bachchan (@bachchan) on May 20, 2017 at 11:11pm PDT After two-and-a-half-day political rhetoric in Karnataka, Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa finally announced his resignation
 vidhansabha main sankhya bal na juta paane ke chalate bijepi kii ye sarkaar mahaj 55 ghante chal saki
 The question arises that where did the BJP miss out on the level of strategy, due to which its government could not be formed but it had to face trouble
 is puri prakriya main party kii chhavi par kuch daag to aise lage hai jinhen lekar vipaksh lambey samay tak use gherta rahegaa
 Whether it is misuse of the post of Governor or the attempt to sell the mlas, the BJP is seen to be surrounded these days
 supreme court tak ne is maamle main hastkshep kiya jiske chalate party kii kirakiri hui
 This is the second such case after the Rajya Sabha election of Ahmed Patel in Gujarat, when the Congress has defeated the BJP at a strategic level
 chunaav parinaam saamne aane ke baad congress (78 siten) ne jedies (37 siten) se doguni seat hote hue bhi kumaraswami ko siem pad kaa ofer de diya
 This made the fight for power in Karnataka even more complicated
 221 siton par hue vidhansabha chunaavon main 104 siten laane ke baavjood bijepi sarkaar nahin bachaa saki
 Even though BS Yeddyurappa was sworn in as CM by Governor Vajubhai Vala, he could not prove majority in the floor test
 is puure prakaran main bijepi ko hi nuksaan uthaanaa padaa or kadam-dar-kadam congress usapar bees sabit hui
 Waiting for the BJP in the South, Karnataka was being promoted by the BJP as the 'last fort' of the Congress
 bijepi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or upi ke siem yogi adityanath ke aakraamak prachaar abhiyaan or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii ranneeti se congress kaa aakhri kila lagbhag dhaha hi diya tha, lekin congress ne siem pad kaa balidaan dekar puraa khel hi badal diya
 In this way, the bjp's entry into South India and the dream of Congress-free India could not be fulfilled in Karnataka
 amit shah par baari padin sonia gandhisonia gandhi ne chunaav parinaam aane se 1 din pehle hi party ke senior netaa gulam nabi aaazaad or ashok gahalot ko karnataka bhej diya tha
 The BJP also sent Prakash Javadekar, Dharmendra Pradhan and Union Minister Anant Hegde to Karnataka, but by then it was too late
 sonia ke kehane par hi matganana vaale din aaazaad ne ech di devgauda ko phone kiya or unke bete kumaraswami ko siem pad ofer kiya
 After this, the BJP kept trying for manipulation for four days, but the government could not save
 bijepi ke kendriya netritv kii kirakiriis puure prakaran ke dauraan bijepi ke kendriya netritv ko bhi kirakiri jhelni padi
 The Congress was already attacking the BJP for making tainted Yeddyurappa the CM candidate
 modi ne unke saath sirf ek sabha kii
 PM Narendra Modi or Amit Shah were also not present in their controversial swearing-in ceremony
 baad main yediurppa, unke bete vijayendra or janardan reddy ke congressi vidhayakon ko dhan or pad kaa ofer dete audio bhi saamne aae
 This also embarrassed the BJP
 puure maamle main bijepi kaa kendriya netritv parde ke peeche hi bana rahaa
 In the Supreme Court too, the Fazihatkangress and JDS approached the Supreme Court on the matter of making Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala's Yeddyurappa a CM, giving the BJP 15 days to prove its majority and making Junior MLA KG Bopaiah the Protem Speaker
 court ne 15 din kii samay-seemaa ko 24 ghante karne ke alaava bahumat pareekshan kii prakiya ke live prasaaran kii bhi ijaajat de di
 In this case too, the BJP was disappointed
 anuchit parampara par uthne lage sawalkarnataka kii uthapatak par desh bhar ke logon kii nazren lagi raheen
 From 2014 onwards, BJP continued to talk of Congress-mukt Bharat, while opposition parties including Congress were accusing the central government of interfering in the politics of the states through the Governor
 karnataka maamle main yah ladaai khulkar aam logon ke bich main aa gai
 Congress and JDS questioned almost all important decisions of the Governor
 supreme court main kareeb 10 hafton baad is maamle kii bhi sunwaayee honi he ki sabase badi party ke paas bahumat na hone or post pole alliance ke paas bahumat hone par kise pehle bahumat pareekshan ke liye kaha jaae or rajyapal kii bhoomika kii samiksha ho sakati he yaa nahin
 The Congress was successful in conveying the message not only to the Supreme Court, but also to the people that the BJP government at the center was adopting unfair methods
 2019 ke liye badi chunauti?bijepi ke liye karnataka kaa sabase bada sabak 2019 ke liye nikalakar saamne aayaa he
 In 2019, a joint opposition alliance against Bijpi seems to be forming
 isamen endie ke kuch ghatak dal bhi shaamil ho sakate hai
 The BJP received its first setback from the joint opposition in the Bihar assembly elections
 haalanki, bijepi ne vipakshi ekta ko upi vidhansabha chunaavon main maat de di thi
 But not being able to form a government in Karnataka before the Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan assembly elections and 2019 Lok Sabha elections is not a good sign for the BJP
 modi lahar ke alaava tikadmi raajnneeti main haar milanaa bhi bijepi ke manobal par nakaaratmak asar daalega
 Apart from this, the BJP will also have to face aggressive joint opposition in the coming elections

 View this post on instagramthe real test in every relationship arises when you're faced with situations like this
 Staying strong and backing eachother up is the true essence of a strong relation between two mature people
 To accept eachother's differences and stick by eachother's side through thick and thin
 None of us are perfect and it’s truly a beautiful experience when you find someone who accepts you for who you are without judging you
 This is what Real relationships are made of
 Because it’s not always rainbows and butterflies, sometimes it’s dark clouds and storms
 And the greater the storm, the brighter your rainbow

 akhilesh yadav ne guuruuvaar ko yah saaf kar diya ki nai party banane vaale unke chachashivpal yadavake khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii jaaegi or na hi unki sadsyta samaapt karne ke liye vidhansabha adhyaksh ko patr likhaa jayega
 It is clear that even after forming the new party Shivpal Yadav and contesting and contesting from the new party, technically the MLA will remain from the socialist party
 akhilesh yadav apane chachaa, shivpal yadav ko koi bhi victim card khilne dena nahin chaahate
 This is the reason why even after coming under the purview of anti-party activities, he will not take disciplinary action against his uncle
 darasal, akhilesh yadav kii yah ranneeti shuru se rahi he ki shivpal yadav ke mudde ko koi tavajjo na di jaae
 Neither leaders should talk about them inside or outside the party, nor should they have any discussion
 apni isi ranneeti ke tahat shivpal yadav ko party se nikaalane kaa vichaar bhi akhilesh ne party ke bheetar panpane nahin diya he
 With the formation of a new party, Shivpal Yadav has made a strong presence and is currently engaged in breaking old Samajwadi Party leaders and joining his party
 aise main agar akhilesh apane chachaa ko party se nikaalte hai yaa unki vidhayaki khatm karne main apni urja lagaate hai to yah shivpal yadav ko victim card khilne main madad degaa
 Sensing this, Akhilesh Yadav is avoiding touching Shivpal Yadav

 SP workers are not tired of stating the government's achievements

 The manner in which the Akhilesh government has taken a U-turn on some of its decisions after assuming power, indicates that the government's homework is weak
 tazatreen maamla pradesh main bijli sankat se nibatane ke upayon se judaa he
 Taking an unprecedented decision on 17 June, the state government gave its decision to close all the shops and malls in the state at 7 pm and withdrew it within 24 hours
 sarkaar kaa paksh rakhte hue ek varisht mantri bataate hai ki shram vibhaag ne aadesh jari karne se pehle mukhyamantri se mashvira nahin kiya
 Leaders of the opposition should have also been asked before taking such tough decisions
 akhilesh sarkaar ke kisi maamle main you-turn lene kaa yah koi pehla vakya nahin he
 Since the formation of the SP government, there have been about half a dozen such occasions when the SP government overturned the decision and surprised everyone
 bijli se jude ek or maamle ko hi lijie
 In 2010, the BSP government signed a Letter of Agreement (AMU) with private companies to set up power plants in Lalitpur, Bhoganipur, Chitrakoot, Farrukhabad, Auraiya, Ghazipur and Sandila
 iske tahat 18 maheene ke bheetar in companiyon ko bijlighar kaa nirmaan shuru kar dena chahie tha
 The SP strongly opposed this plan of the BSP government
 lag rahaa tha ki sapa sarkaar in nijee companiyon kii miyaad aage nahin badhayegi kyonki lalitpur ko chhodkar kisi bhi jagah par nirmaan shuru nahin ho paaya tha
 But reversing all speculation, on June 7, the state government extended the period of setting up power plants of these private companies by 18 months

 Akhilesh Yadav had to change his decisions regarding the status of ministers as soon as he formed the government in the state
 15 march ko akhilesh sarkaar ne shapath lee
 In this, Arvind Singh Gop, Bhagwatsharan Gangwar, Aruna Kori and Rajendra Singh Rana were sworn in as Ministers of State, but on March 18, three days later, the status of those Ministers was elevated to Minister of state-independent Charge
 party ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai ki mantriyon kaa darja badhaane ke peeche alag-alag kaaran the
 Aruna Kori was the only woman minister while Bhagwat Sharan Gangwar was promoted as the only Kurmi minister

 He was rewarded for this
 iske baad number aayaa adhikariyon kaa
 Even in the transfers of officers, the SP government retaliated several times with its decision
 29 march ko der raat rajya sarkaar ne pramukh sachiv chikitsa swasthya sanjay agarwal ko mukhyamantri karyaalay main pramukh sachiv ke pad par tainaat karne kaa aadesh diya, lekin agle din dopaher ko hi is aadesh ko nirast kar unhen pramukh sachiv chikitsa swasthya hi banaae rakhaa gaya
 Similarly, IAS officer Majid Ali, who was influential in the Mayawati government, was removed just two days after being posted as Principal Secretary, Transport
 varisht iees arvind singh dev, rajan shukla bhi un kareeb teen darjan afasaron kii fehrist main shaamil hai, jinaki tainaati yaa to kuch ghanton main yaa kuch din baad badal di gai
 The names of Mayawati's close officers Kunwar Fateh Bahadur and Navneet Sehgal are also included in this list
 28 march ko sarkaar ne fateh bahadur ko pramukh sachiv dharmarth kaary or sahagal ko rajasav parishad, elahabaad main sadsy nyaayik pad par tainaat kiya or do din baad aadesh nirast karte hue sahagal ko sachiv dharmarth kaary par tainaat kar diya or fateh bahadur ko rajasav parishad main sadsy nyaayik banaakar elahabaad bhej diya
 It does not end here

 isamen janata ke hit main kai baar nirnay badalane padate hai
 However, Leader of Opposition and BSP state president Swami Prasad Maurya says, "there are 3-4 chief ministers in the SP government
" isi vajah se sarkaar ko apane nirnay badalane pad rahe hai
 After the formation of the government, Akhilesh Yadav said that the scams during Mayawati's rule will be investigated and if any minister or herself, Mayawati is found involved in it, then action will be taken against her

 Baba Ramdev will now sit on Satyagraha while continuing his fast in Haridwar
 ve ravivaar raat 9 baje se satyagrah par baithne vaale hai
 Earlier, Baba Ramdev announced that he was now going to do Satyagraha at a new place near Delhi
 ramdev ne spasht kiya ki unka anshan abhi bhi jari he
 Muktaib Baba Ramdev told the media that information about the new place of Satyagraha will be given on Sunday evening between 9 to 10 pm
 ramdev ne kaha ki yah unke jivan kaa aitihaasik kshan he
 He said that police did not even take care of human rights while taking barbaric action
 ramdev ne aarope lagaaya ki unke nijee sachiv kii taangen todi gayi
 He said that a woman worker was paralyzed after the police action
 unhone aarope lagaae ki unke gale par bhi police ne fanda daalane kaa kaam kiya
 At the same time, Ramdev also raised questions on the arrest at night
 baba ramdev ne dukhi swar main kaha ki kai kaaryakarta ab bhi laapata hai
 However, the announcement of Satyagraha at the new location has once again intensified
 isse pehle beeti madhyaraatri se jari naatakeey ghatnakramon ke baad baba ramdev ne bhrashtachar or kaledhan ke khilaaf unki ladaai jari rakhane kaa elaan karte hue sansanikhej daawa kiya ki ramlila maidan par unki hatya karne kii sajeesh rachi gayi thi
 After being detained from Delhi, Ramdev was sent by helicopter to Dehradun, from where he reached Haridwar
 haridwar pahunchane ke kuch hi der baad bulaaye gayi samvaadadaata sammelan main ramdev ne beeti madhyaraatri ke baad hue ghatnakramon kaa silsilewar byora bataaya or sarkaar par gambhir aarope bhi lagaaye
 Ramdev wept in an emotional tone, saying that the government was preparing to lay the dead bodies on the Ramlila ground and thousands of people would have been killed if our workers did not work with patience
 unhone kal kii ghatana kii tulana jaliyanvaala baag kii ghatana se karte hue daawa kiya, ‘‘ramlila maidan par mujhe giraftaar karne ke baad meraa encounter karne yaa mujhe gaayab kar dene kii taiyaari thi
 There was a conspiracy to kill me
 jab teen june ko dilli ke ek hotel main bhi hamaari sarkaar se baatcheet chal rahi thi, tab bhi ramlila maidan par badi taadaad main pulicekarmi tainaat kar diye gayi the
 "ramdev said," If any danger arises in front of my life, it will be the responsibility of Sonia Gandhi and the Congress
 ’’ unhone kaha ki bhrashtachar or kaledhan ke khilaaf unki ladaai jari rahegi
 But on what strategy will be adopted next, he said that he will disclose by evening
 unhone kaha ki ravivaar shaam or somvaar ko desh bhar main unke samarthak shantipurna tareek se ‘kaala diwas’ manaayenge
 Yogguru said that the government did not bring an ordinance on black money, but it committed atrocities like Emergency
 yogaguru ke chehre par pareshaani or chintaa saaf dekhi ja sakati thi
 He was confronted by the media in the same women's dress, which he wore and left the Ramlila grounds after midnight
 ramdev ne kaha ki sarkaar ke saath baatcheet hone ke baad hamen yah dhamkee di gayi thi ki yaa to ham baat maan len yaa phir parinaam bhugatne ke liye taiyaar rahen, isaliye acharya baalkrishna se yah jhooth bolkar dabaav main ek khat par dastakhat karaaye gayi ki chitthee dikhaakar pradhanmantri ko vishwaas main lenaa he
 He said that the letter reached us by the government late in the night, there was no mention of black money issue in it
 unhone kaha, ‘‘kaali raat ko jab main yaad karata hum to rongte khadey ho jate hai or meri aatma kaanp uthati he
 What happened at Ramlila Maidan yesterday at midnight has crossed all limits of barbarity
 maine vahaan karrwai karne aaye pulicekarmiyon se nirdosh mahilaon or bacchon par laathiyaan nahin barasaane kaa baar-baar anurodh kiya, lekin ramlila maidan par police kaa daman chakra chalata rahaa
 Ramdev directly targeted Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal, saying, "sibal is a man of devious and vicious mind
 unhone hamaare saath kutilata se chaalen chalin
 "he also said about Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh," i do not think it appropriate to comment on those who are irresponsible and make baseless allegations
 ’’andolan ko rashtriya swayamsevak sangh yaa bhaajapa dwaara pryojit karne ke aaropon par yogaguru ne kaha ki unhen anya sanghathanon or muslim samaaj ke logon kaa bhi samarthan tha
 On June 3, Telugu Desam Party President Chandrababu Naidu also expressed support by talking to him over the phone
 apane sahyogi acharya baalkrishna ke bare main unhone kaha ki vah dilli main hai or surakshit hai
 On the question related to being allowed to do only yoga camps at Ramlila Maidan, Ramdev said that we had taken permission for yoga and thousands of people also did yoga there, but after the Yogasan, the fast which was done on the issue of corruption and black money, That too comes in the limits and limits of yoga
 ramdev ne kaha ki sarkaar videshon main jamaa kaledhan ko rashtriya sampatti ghoshit karne, peshewar paathyakramon kii pravesh parikshaayen bhartiya bhashaaon main karaane, bhrashtachar ke mukademon ke niptaare ke liye fast trek adaalaton kaa gathan karne or lok seva vitaran adhinium banane ke liye vidheyak pesh karne par sahamat ho chuki thi, lekin is sambandh main vah likhit aashwaasan nahin de rahi thi
 He said that the government's reasoning was not to give an assurance in writing to issue an ordinance about declaring black money as a national asset, that we should end the fast first
 ramdev ne kaha ki sarkaar ke rukh se yah saaf hota he ki na to vah lokapal kaa gathan karnaa chaahati he or na hi videshon main jamaa kaledhan ko rashtriya sampatti ghoshit karnaa chaahati he
 The reason behind this is that declaring black money as a national asset will expose government ministers and many leaders of Congress and its allies
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki meraa anshan pryojit tha
 If it was sponsored, then why were sticks and tear gas shells fired on my supporters there

 Addressing the media on the eve of the meeting, Sangh's All India Publicity chief Manmohan Vaidya said that the recent census figures show a balance in population growth
 unhone kaha, ‘baithak main is vishay par gahan vichaar-vimarsh kiya jayega or is sambandh main ek prastaav paarit kiya ja saktaa he

 Appeal to discuss the report of the Commission: The RSS called for a nationwide discussion on the report of the Upamanyu Hazarika Commission which said that infiltration from Bangladesh poses a threat to Assam's original population becoming a minority by 2047
 RSS ke akhil bhartiya prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya ne kaha, ‘haal main hajarika ayog kii report ne assam or bengal main janasankhyikeey sthiti main parivartan ke bare main ek chaunkaane vaali jaankaree di he
 If this trend continues, the population of Indians will decrease and foreigners will increase
 ’ unhone kaha ki is sambandh main deshvyapee charchaa honi chahie
 Ranchi Vaidya, who also reached Mohan Bhagwat, said that RSS would conduct extensive research on 'imbalance in population growth' in its three-day All India Executive Board meeting starting here on Sunday and a resolution could be passed in this regard
 aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat baithak main hissaa lene ke liye ranchi main hai
 The Hazarika Commission, a member formed by the Supreme Court on the indo-bangladesh border, submitted its report with the recommendation that the Supreme Court order a high-level inquiry into issues of concern regarding infiltration from Bangladesh
 kyonki assam kii mul jansankhya ke 2047 tak alpsankhyak ban jane kaa khatra utpann ho gaya he
 The court has directed the central and Assam governments to respond to this recommendation on the next hearing to be held on November 5
 - input bhashaa Modi wave has been found
 teen maheene se news channel or dher saare patrkaar gaanv gaanv main modi lahar khoj rahe the, bataa rahe the ki nahin mil rahi he
 When not found, they started looking for the under current
 akhirkaar aaj unhen modi lahar mil gai he
 Thanks to the exit poll
 eggzet pole ke nattejey bataa rahe hai ki modi lahar dhuandhar he
 In every survey, BJP plus government is being formed comfortably
 yah puri tarah aap par he ki aap eggzet pole par bharosa karte hai yaa nahin karte hai
 In both cases, exit polls do not matter
 yah zarur he ki 23 taarikh tak aap tivi par kuch nahin dekh paaenge
 Make this complaint only when you were able to see a lot before 23
 bas do baaten bataanaa chahta hum ek whatsap uniwarsity se he or ek austrailia se hai
 whatsapp University liked the fact that keep the voice of TV low, stay around friends or family, wear loose cotton cloth, keep cooler or AC on, take deep breath, keep smiling in the middle, the world is enchanted, Keep remembering this
 aaj eggzet pole kaa pehla din he
 If you get scared from now, how will it work? abhi to nateezon ke din tak aapako iskaa saamana karnaa he
 Recall how many exit polls you have seen, have faced them
 galat hone ke baad phir se dekhne kii himmat jutai he
 On this basis, i have made a theory about exit poll
 pentate nahin hua he or na hi nobel prize mila he
 So the exit poll is the first scientific work in the world which is done to be wrong even after being wrong
 ek theory or nikal kar ai he
 That is, the number may be wrong in the exit poll but the trend is correct
 sabhi pole galat nahin hote hai
 Some polls are also correct
 is baar ke sabhi pole main bijepi kii sarkaar ban rahi he
 So which poll will be wrong, it will be known to 23
 news channel eggzet pole ko lekar kaaphi sirius hai
 There were people in Australia too
 vahaan jitne bhi chunaav ke pehle opinian pols hue, 50 se adhik ve sabhi galat nikle
 There were no exit polls, pre poll surveys have turned out to be wrong
 magar is galati kaa ek anjaam bahut acha hua ki survey ke nattejey dekhakar lebar party ne jashn manaa liya ki ve jeet rahe hai
 When the result came out, the opportunity to celebrate was to Liberal Parsi
 lekin isse ghabaraane kii zarurat nahin he
 Survey and exit polls are wrong everywhere
 america or britain jaise mulk main ek hi din matdaan hota he or usee din nateeja aa jaataa he
 There is no exit poll
 kyonki matdaan khatm hone or nattejey aane main samay kaa behad kam antar hota he
 Therefore, time is cut in the channels there only after the poll conducted before the polling
 bharat ek jatil mulk he
 The number of seats is also high
 kai baar yahaan chunaav ayog bhi factor ho jaataa he to kisi survey main nahin dikhataa he
 How can a poll be correct without the Election Commission factor
 aap eggzet pole ke galat hone se bilkul na ghabaraaen
 Rather, if you want to set up the business of exit poll under start up, then definitely do
 hamane dekha he ki kai chunaavon main kai survey companiyon ke survey galat nikle
 But they all got business in the next election
 itnaa tagada bijness he jisamen galat sabit hone par aapako ek or baar galat hone kaa mauqaa miltaa he
 There are many exit polls
 ham nahin karte hai lekin ham sabakaa ausat bataate hai
 In 2014, BJP alone got 282 seats
 endie ko 336
 Sudarshan News, republic-c voter, Republic Jan Ki Baat, Suvarna News 24x7, Sakshi TV, News Nation, all exit polls Amit Shah's claim on one side
 unhone daawa kiya he ki 300 siten aa rahi hai
 a comfortable government is being formed
 upi ke bare main amit shah ne kaha tha ki 73 se ek seat kam nahin aegi balki 74 bhi ho saktaa he
 Remember that Amit Shah had 72 seats when he was in charge in 2014
 2015 main amit shah ne bihar ke liye mishan 185 rakhaa tha, bijepi ko 99 siten ain, 86 siten kam ain
 In the Bengal Legislative Assembly in 2016, the target of Mission 150 was 3 seats, 147 seats reduced
 upi vidhansabha 2017 main mishan 203 kaa lakshya tha, 325 siten aa gai thim
 122 seats were more
 2017 main gujarat vidhansabha main mishan 150 kaa lakshya tha, bijepi ko 99 siten ain, 51 siten kam ain
 Mission 50 Plus was targeted in Himachal Pradesh in 2017, 44 seats came, 6 seats reduced
 2018 main karnataka vidhansabha main mishan 150 tha, bijepi ko 104 siten ain
 46 seats were reduced
 aapane silent voter ke bare main kaaphi kuch suna tha
 What is a silent voter
 kya yah daraa hua voter hota he yaa isaki apni ranneeti hoti he
 Research has been done in the academy world for many decades
 duniya bhar main
 Will we ever know the silent voter
 yahi wo silent voter he jo achaanak saare aankalan palat detaa he
 In Bihar, Lalu Yadav used to call it the genie out of the box
 loktantr main yaa taanaashaahee main naagarik kab silent ho jaataa he iske alag-alag kaaran ho sakate hai
 In English this process has been understood through 'pluralistic ignorance'
 matlab naagarik kaa bartaav public main yaa bheed main uske jaisaa hota he lekin akele main vah thik uskaa ulta sochataa he
 There is a book about this you can read
 Cristina bikyari kii The grammar of society
 Another book is Timur Kuran's Private Lies, Public Truths which studies the decline of the communist governments of Eastern Europe
 soviet sangh kaa vighatan hua to purvi europe ke kai mulkon main communist sarkarein bharbhara kar gir gayi
 No one had any idea
 kyonki saarvajanik rup se janata sarkaar kaa samarthan karti thi magar akele main virodh karti thi
 We have not read both books but our friend Vatsal told that the audience should be told about the silent voter
 jab logon ko public main bolne kii azaadi nahin hoti, bhay hota he to ve chup ho jate hai
 Both of these studies belong to dictatorial governments
 bharat main loktantr he
 But can an independent country like India be understood as a silent voter? use kaise samajha janaa chahie

 royal chalanger bangalore ke kilaaf bhi mumbai kii mushkil kam nahin hone vaali
 By the way, the team was in similar trouble last season
 tippaniyan Mumbai lost all five of their matches at the start of the tournament last year, but the team made a strong comeback to reach the semi-finals
 chaar maichon main team kii ballebaazi kram main prayog hote rahe hai
 Rohit Sharma, Aaron Finch and Lyndon Simmons have been tried at the opening
 harbhajan singh ke ballebaazi kram main bhi badlaav kiye gaye hai
 Despite all this, captain Rohit Sharma's team is still looking for a winning combination
 vaise, ballebaazi main rohit sharma, kiron pollard or harbhajan singh ne vyaktigat taur par acha pradarshan kiya he
 Pollard has played a strong half-century in the last two games and is the most dangerous of these batsmen
 vahiin gendbaazi main lasith malinga ahm mauqon par team ko kamyaabi dilaane main naakaam rahe hai
 He has only 4 wickets in his account so far
 harbhajan singh ne 5 wicket zarur liye hai lekin wo asardaar dikhaai nahin de rahe hai
 On the other hand Bangalore started the tournament with a win over Kolkata but lost to Hyderabad
 har sizan kii tarah is saal bhi viraat kii team kris gail par bahut zyaada nirbhar dikhaai de rahi he
 Apart from Gayle, the team has strong batsmen like Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers and Dinesh Karthik
 ballebaazi main team ke paas kai star khilaadi mauzood hai lekin gendbaazi main bangalore kamazor nazar aa rahi he
 Bangalore has one win and one loss so far, on the other hand Mumbai would like to open an account with a win
 pichley saal toornament ke shuruyaat main mumbai apane paanchon match haar gai thi lekin team ne zordaar vaapasi karte hue semifinal tak kaa safar tay kiya
 The batting of the team has been used in the order of four matches

 Changes have also been made in the batting order of Harbhajan Singh
 in sab ke baavjood captain rohit sharma kii team ko ab bhi vining combination kii talash he

 At the same time, in the bowling, Lasith Malinga has failed to succeed the team on important occasions
 unke khate main ab tak sirf 4 wicket hai
 Harbhajan Singh has taken 5 wickets but he does not look effective
 duusari taraf bangalore ne toornament kii shuruyaat kolkata par jeet se kii, lekin hyderabad se haar gai
 Like every season, Virat's team this year seems to be heavily dependent on Chris Gayle

 imotional ho jaaenge aap The film 'manjhi: The Mountain Man' is released this Friday
 yah kahani he bihar ke dasharath maanjhi kii, jisane akele 22 saalon main sirf hathode or chheni se pahaad katkar rasta bana daalaa or 70 kilometre kii duuri ko ek kilometre main samet diya
 The film stars Dasharatha Manjhi as Nawazuddin Siddiqui, his wife as Radhika Apte, Mukhiya as Tigmanshu Dhulia and Manjhi's father as ashraf-ul-haq
 film ke nirdeshak hai kethan mehta
 In the story, Dasharatha Manjhi decides to cut the mountain when his wife falls from the mountain and is so late in reaching the hospital 70 km away that he loses them
 sabase pehle salaam us iraade ko jo pahaad se buland the
 Now it is about the shortcomings and weaknesses of the film
 film kaa pehla bhaag dasharath maanjhi ke qirdaar ko samajhane or unki patni se mohabbat ko darshane main nikal jaataa he
 Though the story is short and it is difficult to spread it on the big screen, but being a film in this true story could have been avoided
 film ke pehle bhaag main dasharath maanjhi kaa junun or unke dard ko mahasoos karnaa zaraa mushkil laga
 Background scores are not as per the heart of the film, due to which it stings like noise in many places
 ab baat khoobiyon kii
 After the interval you will be associated with the film
 aapako dasharath kaa dard bhi mahasoos hoga or system se ladane main uski laachaari bhi, film main maanjhi kaa junun bhi dikhataa he or sanak bhi
 The whole process of cutting the mountain has some moments and scenes that will shake you
 film main chuaa-chhot, immergency or bhrashtachar teenon ko hi dasharath maanjhi kii kahani ke zarie nirdeshak ne badi khubsuurati se pesh kiya he
 Nowhere do these things seem like knowledge, which is often feared
 film main dasharath ke qirdaar main nawaz ne saraahneey kaam kiya he
 At the same time, Radhika Apte delivers the role of Manjhi's wife properly
 film ke do gane, 'fagunia', 'o raahi' achche lage
 The comments pahaad katkar nadiyaan bahaane kii kahaniyaan hamane sirf padhi or suni thim par dasharath maanjhi kii dastaan ab un kahaniyon par vishwaas karne ke liye majaboor karti he
 Although 'manjhi: The Mountain Man' is a star who does not need the stars of critics, but if the proclamation of moving the mountain is to be true, then definitely watch this film
 is film ko 3
 5 stars 
 
 film main dasharath maanjhi kii bhoomika main hai navazuddin siddiqi, unki patni ke qirdaar main hai radhika apte, mukhiya bane hai tigmanshu dhulia or maanjhi ke pita ke qirdaar main hai ashraf ul haq
 Ketan Mehta is the director of the film
 kahani main dasharath maanjhi pahaad kaatane kaa faisalaa tab lete hai, jab unki patni pahaad se gir jaati hai or 70 kimi dur aspataal tak use pahunchane main itani deree ho jaati he ki vah unhen kho baithte hai
 First of all salute the intention that was elevated from the mountain
 ab baat film kii kaamiyon or kuubiyon kii
 The first part of the film goes into explaining Dasharatha Manjhi's role and showing love to his wife
 haalanki kahani choti he or use bade parde par failaana mushkil kaam he, par is sachhee kahani main zaraa filmi hone se bachaa ja saktaa tha
 In the first part of the film, it was difficult to feel the passion and pain of Dashrath Manjhi
 becoground score film ke marm ke mutabik nahin lage, jiske kaaran vah kai jagah shor kii tarah chubhta he
 Now talk of merits interval ke baad aap film se jude rahenge
 You will also feel the pain of Dasharatha and her helplessness in fighting the system, Manjhi's passion is also seen in the film and also the craze
 pahaad kaatane kii puri prakriya main kuch aise lamhen or seens hai jo aapako hilaa denge
 In the film, touching, untouchability, emergency and corruption are all three beautifully presented by the director through the story of Dashrath Manjhi
 ye baaten kahin bhi gyaan kii tarah nahin lagatee, jiskaa akasar dar hota he
 Nawaz has done a commendable job in Dasharatha's role in the film
 vahiin radhika apte maanjhi kii patni ke role ko thik se anjaam tak pahunchaati hai
 The film's two songs, 'faguniya', 'O Rahi' were good
 tippaniyan We had only read and heard the stories of rivers flowing through the mountains, but the story of Dashrath Manjhi now forces us to believe those stories
 yun to 'maanjhi: da mountain main' vah star hai, jinhen samikshakon ke stars kii zarurat nahin, par parvat hilaane kii kahawat ko agar sach hote dekhnaa he to yah film zarur dekhen
 Make this film 3
 5 stars

 film ke pehle bhaag main dasharath maanjhi kaa junun or unke dard ko mahasoos karnaa zaraa mushkil laga
 Background scores are not as per the heart of the film, due to which it stings like noise in many places
 ab baat khoobiyon kii
 After the interval you will be associated with the film
 aapako dasharath kaa dard bhi mahasoos hoga or system se ladane main uski laachaari bhi, film main maanjhi kaa junun bhi dikhataa he or sanak bhi
 The whole process of cutting the mountain has some moments and scenes that will shake you
 film main chuaa-chhot, immergency or bhrashtachar teenon ko hi dasharath maanjhi kii kahani ke zarie nirdeshak ne badi khubsuurati se pesh kiya he
 Nowhere do these things seem like knowledge, which is often feared
 film main dasharath ke qirdaar main nawaz ne saraahneey kaam kiya he
 At the same time, Radhika Apte delivers the role of Manjhi's wife properly
 film ke do gane, 'fagunia', 'o raahi' achche lage
 The comments pahaad katkar nadiyaan bahaane kii kahaniyaan hamane sirf padhi or suni thim par dasharath maanjhi kii dastaan ab un kahaniyon par vishwaas karne ke liye majaboor karti he
 Although 'manjhi: The Mountain Man' is a star who does not need the stars of critics, but if the proclamation of moving the mountain is to be true, then definitely watch this film
 is film ko 3
 5 stars 
 
 ab baat film kii kaamiyon or kuubiyon kii
 The first part of the film goes into explaining Dasharatha Manjhi's role and showing love to his wife
 haalanki kahani choti he or use bade parde par failaana mushkil kaam he, par is sachhee kahani main zaraa filmi hone se bachaa ja saktaa tha
 In the first part of the film, it was difficult to feel the passion and pain of Dashrath Manjhi
 becoground score film ke marm ke mutabik nahin lage, jiske kaaran vah kai jagah shor kii tarah chubhta he
 Now talk of merits interval ke baad aap film se jude rahenge
 You will also feel the pain of Dasharatha and her helplessness in fighting the system, Manjhi's passion is also seen in the film and also the craze
 pahaad kaatane kii puri prakriya main kuch aise lamhen or seens hai jo aapako hilaa denge
 In the film, touching, untouchability, emergency and corruption are all three beautifully presented by the director through the story of Dashrath Manjhi
 ye baaten kahin bhi gyaan kii tarah nahin lagatee, jiskaa akasar dar hota he
 Nawaz has done a commendable job in Dasharatha's role in the film
 vahiin radhika apte maanjhi kii patni ke role ko thik se anjaam tak pahunchaati hai
 The film's two songs, 'faguniya', 'O Rahi' were good
 tippaniyan We had only read and heard the stories of rivers flowing through the mountains, but the story of Dashrath Manjhi now forces us to believe those stories
 yun to 'maanjhi: da mountain main' vah star hai, jinhen samikshakon ke stars kii zarurat nahin, par parvat hilaane kii kahawat ko agar sach hote dekhnaa he to yah film zarur dekhen
 Make this film 3

 After regaining consciousness, layers of mystery begin to unravel and a new drama unfolds that Fifu had actually reached Pakistan
 jahaan usne ek raajnneetik drame main bahut mahatvapurn hissaa nibhaayaa or uske us drame ke kaaran hi desh kii hindu rashtravaadi party chunaav main parajeet ho gai
 This is a weak aspect of the novel because it is not easily believed
 aaraar kaa krime kii is kaali duniya kaa romaanchak safar bahut hi dilachasp or chaunkaane vaala he
 Many people may not believe it, but it is true that the character of Delhi has changed a lot
 lekhak ne bahut hi aasaan tareeke or saral bhashaa main is plot ko sulajhane kii koshish kii he
 There is flow in this story and she moves fast
 lekhak ne har episod ko baandhakar rakhane kii koshish kii he or kisi ko bhi anaavashyak rup se lanbaa khinchne nahin diya he
 Like a good thriller, the author has kept the characters tied
 aaraar ko badali hui duniya kaa yah rup dang kar detaa he
 In this journey, he himself starts going through sex fantasies
 fifu kii talash main unka har padaav unhen ek nae rahasy kaa pardaa uthaane ko vivash kar detaa he jise jaanane ke baad vah hairat se bhar jate hai

 uski pidaa he ki is desh main musalamaanon ko unka haq nahin mil paa rahaa he lekin iske baavjood vah bahut dukhi nahin hota he or apane kaam main puri shiddat se laga hua he
 This novel published by Roopa Publications can be a subject of great interest to those who like the thriller
 isaki puri kahani tej gati se chalati he, bas ant thodaa aswabhaavik lagata he kyonki ek krime or sex thriller kaa ant raajnneetik jaisaa ho to baat hajam nahin ho paati he
 However, this novel will definitely be liked by those who like this type of thriller

 uttar pradesh ke saharanpur main ek mahila ne halaala ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai he
 The woman is a doctor by profession
 mahila ke mutabik, uske pati ne use teen talaak diya or phir nikaah halaala kaa dabaav banaaya
 The woman went to the District Magistrate of Saharanpur to plead for justice
 jiladhikari ne kaha ki mahila jo peshey se doctor he, vah yah kehete hue madad maangane ai ki uske pati ne use teen taalak de diya he or use nikaah halaala ke liye jane ko kaha he
 An FIR has been registered in this case
 isse pehle uttar pradesh ke bareli main teen talaak or halaala kaa maamla saamne aayaa tha
 In Bareilly, a Muslim man first divorced his wife and made him homeless and then remarried with his own father to keep the divorced wife together
 itnaa hi nahin, bahu ke saath susar kaa nikaah karaane ke baad shuhar dobaaraa talaak dekar bhai se halaala karaane par ad gaya

 For this, he wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in which he said that nikah halala and polygamy are extremely shameful and inhuman social evils
 maliwal ne likhaa tha, 'main narendra modi ko teen talaak jaisi saamaajik kuritiyon ke khilaaf kanoon paas karwaane kii koshish ke liye badhai dena chaahati hum
 In a civilized society where women and men have equal status in every aspect, there is no place for such evils
 vaise bhi jab pakistan, bangladesh or anya kaaphi saare deshon main bhi ek baar main teen talaak kii prakriya par pratibandh he, to phir hamaare desh main kyon nahin?' On Tuesday, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of decisions related to finance and land due to a rift between Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi and the government
 supreme court ne kaha ki centreshasit pradesh sarkaar saat june ko hone vaali cabinet meeting ho sakati he lekin isamen vittiya or jameen sambandhi liya gaya faisla 21 june tak lagu nahin hoga
 The Supreme Court issued a notice to the Puducherry government on the application of Kiran Bedi
 mukhyamantri narayansami ko bhi maamle main pakshakaar banaaya, narayansami ko bhi notice bheja gaya
 The next hearing is on 21 June
 supreme court ne mukhyamantri narayan sami ko pakshakaar banane kii ijaajat di he
 The court said that the status quo would remain in the case of finance and services
 kiran bedi kii ore se kaha gaya ki puduccheri main halaat thik nahin hai
 The Chief Minister is abolishing the LG office
 saat june ko cabinet kii meeting bhi bulaai gai he
 In such a situation, till the decision of the Supreme Court, the Chief Minister should be prevented from taking any decision related to finance and services
 puduccheri sarkaar dilli ke faisle ke tahat kaam kar rahi he jabaki dilli sarkaar kaa faisla puduccheri par lagu nahin hota
 In fact, Puducherry's Lieutenant Governor (LG) Kiran Bedi reached the Supreme Court alleging administrative chaos and sought to prevent Chief Minister v Narayanasamy from passing any Chief Executive Order related to finance, services
 isse pehle supreme court ne madras hoicourt ke unke adhikaron ko lekar faisle par roak lagane se inkaar kiya tha
 On the petition of the Central Government against the decision of the Madras High Court, the Supreme Court issued notice to the Congress MLA Lakshmi Narayan, who filed the petition in the High Court
 darasal haal hi main madras hoicourt ne saaf kiya tha ki uparajyapal kiran bedi ke paas centreshasit pradesh kii rosemara kii gatividhiyon main hastkshep karne kii shakti nahin he
 After this direction of the court, Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi cannot ask the government of this union territory about any file
 iske saath hi vah na to sarkaar ko koi aadesh de sakati he or na hi sarkaar kii taraf koi aadesh jari kar sakengi
 Explain that the court is hearing a petition related to political arrogance and jurisdiction issued between Puducherry CM v Narayanasamy and Kiran Bedi
 narayansami kaa aarope he ki kiran bedi kai mahatvapurn projects se judi filon ko sarkaar ke paas nahin bhej rahi hai
