 In this regard, VHP has prepared a plan with the society
 iske mutabik sant samaaj raashtrapati or pradhanmantri se mulaakaat karegaa
 At the same time, the saints have decided to pressurize the central government to bring an ordinance on the construction of the Ram temple
 santon ne diya ultimatumshuukravaar ko dilli main viechpi kii ore se yojit kii gai baithak main desh bhar se aae sadhu-santon ne ram mandir nirmaan ke liye modi sarkaar ko chaar maheene kaa ultimatum diya he
 The saints have clearly said that the government should find a way to construct the temple by 31 January
 santon ne kaha ki 31 janvari tak sarkaar koi faisla nahin karti he to phir 1 farvari ko dharm sansad main aage kii ranneeti banaai jaaegi
 The plan of Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Friday with the committee of saints in Delhi passed the proposal for construction of Ram temple
 iske alaava sant samaaj desh main aisa maahaul taiyaar karne ke liye baqayda ranneeti bhi banaai he
 Under this, in November, saints have prepared a program to meet all the mps of the country so that the issue of construction of Ram temple can be raised in Parliament
 iske alaava 6 disambar se 18 disambar (gita jayanti) tak desh bhar ke mandiron or gurudwaron main sant samaaj jaakar ram mandir nirmaan kaa maahaul banaaenge
 The 'ordinance on triple talaq so why not for the temple' Sant Samaj will meet the Governor of all the states of the country along with religious and social institutions in the state and make them aware of the public sentiments on this issue

 This is the reason why the Ram temple campaign of saints is being seen from the perspective of politics
 samaajawaadee party ke pravaktaa sunil saajan ne ajtak se baatcheet main kaha ki maujuuda samay main modi sarkaar kisaan, mahangaai or rojgaar jaise mudde par ghiri hui he
 BJP imposes how it will face these issues in the 2019 elections
 aise main bijepi in muddon se dhyaan ke liye viechpi or sant samaaj ke sahare ram mandir ke mudde ko uthaa rahi he
 He said that when the Modi government came to power in 2014, why this issue was not raised
 ab jab chunaav sar par he or sarkaar janata ke muddon par ghiri hui he to unhone ram kaa sahaara lenaa shuru kar diya he
 These people are not the campaign of the devotees of Lord Ram, but of the BJP and Sangh devotees
 sapa netaa ne kaha ki aise main sawaal uthta he ki desh samvidhan se chalegaa yaa phir aasthaa se
 Togadia will make a separate organization from yatravihp for the temple - International Hindu Council (AHP) Pravin Togadia also said on Friday that if the central government fails to bring an ordinance for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, then it will come from Lucknow from October 21 Will rally till Ayodhya

 (input from agencies) bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah ne aatankwaad ke masale par congress par joardaar hamalaa bolaa he
 Amit Shah said that at a time when the whole world is with India regarding terrorism and terrorist Masood Azhar, the statements of leaders of Congress and some political parties are helping the enemy
 amit shah ne congress se ye bhi sawaal kiya ki 2010 main jab unki sarkaar thi tab 25 aatankiyon ko kyon choda gaya
 The BJP president wrote in his blog that the way global pressure has been put on Pakistan regarding terrorist Masood Azhar is unprecedented
 masood ajahar or uske aatanki sanghathan ko lekar pakistan baari dabaav kii sthiti main he
 All the countries and global organizations of the world stand with India
 pakistan kisi bhi tarah apni saakh ko bachaane kii kavayadon main laga he
 He said that in such a situation when Pakistan has come under pressure, then the terrorist leaders are getting help from the questions being raised by some political parties including Congress within the country
 amit shah ne kaha ki yah durbhagyapurna he ki congress 1999 ke us qandahar vimaan apharan kii ghatana ko aaj apni starhin raajnneeti kaa hathiyaar bana rahi he, jo atyant samvedansheel or 170 se adhik logon kii jokhim main padi jindagi se judi ghatana thi
 Some of these people were also from other countries, whose safety was our responsibility
 rahul gandhi desh kii janata ko gumraah karke or un logon kii jindagi ke prati asamvedansheeltaa dikhaate hue modi sarkaar se sawaal puch rahe hai ki atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar ne masood ajahar ko kyon chhod tha
 He said, is this really a question that is still unanswered
 kya congress ko nahin pataa ki jab vimaan apharan kii vah aatanki vaardaat hui tab pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ne is vishay par charchaa ke liye ek sarvadaleey baithak bulaai thi? us baithak main congress kii taraf swayan congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or purv pradhanmantri dow
 Manmohan Singh was present
 desh ke maanas ko sweekaarte hue tathaa vimaan main fanse logon ke jivan kii raksha ko praathamikta maanate hue sabhi raajnneetik dalon kii sahmati ke baad yah nirnay liya gaya ki un sabhi logon kii jindagi hamaare liye adhik mahatvapurn he, jo vimaan main fanse hai
 In the end all the parties unanimously accepted the proposal to hand over Masood Azhar and bring his people back
 amit shah ne kaha ki yah desh ke logon kii maang thi
 It was our priority to get people at risk, we did what was then the only possible route
 yah kadam koi ‘gudwil jescher’ main nahin uthaaya gaya tha
 Even the then foreign minister Jaswant Singh, whose son is now in the Congress, had said in an interview in 2009 that Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh had agreed to the all-party meeting
 aaj congress or rahul gandhi us ghatana par sawaal uthaakar na sirf asamvedansheeltaa kaa parichay de rahe hai balki apni party ke varisht netaaon ke vivek par prashnchinh laga rahe hai
 He said that by raising this non-essential issue, the Congress has started a debate on such releases in history, which are going to raise questions on the Congress itself
 yah bahes masood ajahar kii rihaai se na to shuru hoti he or na hi samaapt hoti he
 This list is big, if discussed, the Congress will look tainted
 kandahar vimaan apharan kii ghatana se das saal pehle desh ke tatkaaleen grahamantri mufti mohammad said kii beti rubaiyaa said kaa kashmir ke ghati kshetra main aatankiyon ne apharan kar liya
 In return, they demanded the release of 10 terrorists
 sarkaar ne us maang ko sweekaar kiya or aatankiyon kii rihaai kii gai
 It was also not a Goodwill gesture
 '25 aatankiyon ko kyon chodi congress'amit shah ne kaha ki congress ko yah bataanaa chahie ki 2010 main jab congress kii sarkaar thi, tab 28 may ko 25 aatankiyon ko kyon choda gaya? us samay na to koi aisi paristhiti thi or na hi aisa koi dabaav, lekin pakistan se rishte sudhaarney ke naam par congress kii upie-2 sarkaar ne 25 aatankiyon ko reeha kar diya
 It is important to know that among these 25 terrorists, there was a terrorist who was not released in 1999
 ye sabhi 25 aatanki jaish-e-mohammad or lashkare-taiyaba jaise aatanki sanghathanon se jude hai
 Shahid Latif, one of these abandoned terrorists, later became the main handler of the Pathankot terror attack
 aaj apni raajnneeti ke liye ek atyant samvedansheel sthiti main liye gaye sarvasammati ke nirnay par sawaal uthaane vaali congress kya jawaab degi ki in aatankiyon kii rihaai kyon kii gai thi?bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha ki darasal congress kii niti hameshaa aatankwaad, algaavvaad or naksalwad ko lekar dhulmul rahi he
 Senior Congress leader Sheila Dixit herself has admitted that Manmohan Singh's policy on terrorism was loose compared to the strict policies of the Modi government
 shila dikshit ne ek swaabhaavik bayaan diya he
 There is no doubt that when the Congress government was in the country for ten years, terrorist incidents were common in different parts of the country including Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur
 lekin 2014 main modi sarkaar aane ke baad pichley paanch saal main aatankiyon ko hamane seemaa ke irdagird hi samet kar rakhane main safalataa hasil kii he
 It has become impossible to penetrate the internal security of the country by terrorists
 desh kii seemaa par bhi modi sarkaar kii niti aatankwaad ke khilaaf ‘jiro tolerance’ kii he
 Today if a terrorist tries to come or there is a terrorist incident, the brave soldiers of India give a befitting reply to their origin
 amit shah ne kaha ki yah sach he ki satta main rahete hue aatankwaad par dhulmul niti apnaane vaali congress vipaksh main rahakar aatankwaad, algaavvaad or naksalwad kii peeth sahalaane kaa koi mauka nahin chhodti
 Standing and supporting Congress President Rahul Gandhi with a crumbling gang is a direct example of this
 kya congress jawaab degi ki 2008 main hue batla house encounter main aatankwaadiyon ke maare jane par sonia gandhi foot-foot kar kyon roi thim? modi sarkaar main in sab par nakel kasne kii kavayaden huin to inkaa bokhalaanaa to swaabhaavik tha, congress kii baukhalaahat bhi khulkar aane lagi
 If everything goes according to plan, then they can become the Prime Minister when the Congress comes to power
 rahul gandhi ko jitna main jaanata hum, us bina par kah saktaa hum ki ve sarkaar kii jimmedaari sanbhaalane se hichakenge
 And then this man will be Rahul's Manmohan Singh
 '' yah kahana he congress ke ek mahasachiv kaa, jo ve swaabhaavik hi naam ujagar na karne kii shart par kehete hai
 This has been said about telecom entrepreneur Sam Pitroda, who is currently promoting the party in Gujarat
 rajya main disambar main matdaan hona he
 This statement of the party general secretary is, of course, speculative, but the rise of Pitroda as a political voice cannot be ignored
 unhen pehle hi kurta or jaani-pahachaani gandhi topi main dekha gaya he
 He is giving speeches that are full of hidden gestures in the electoral atmosphere
 ek namoona dekhie_ ''agar aap loktantr kii baat karen, to aapako samuhik aguai kii jarurat hoti he
 You cannot make one person take all the decisions
 vah bhagwaan hi kyon na ho, yahaan tak ki vah bhi itnaa kaabil nahin
 Pitroda's words, apparently taunting Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 siyasat main yah unki duusari pari he
 Pitroda, a close advisor to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, is often credited with the telecom revolution in India
 ve odisha ke teetlagarh ke ek gujarati parivaar main janme
 His original name is Satyanarayana Gangaram Pitroda
 ve bharat ke rashtriya gyaan ayog ke pramukh rahe hai or unhone jan soochna, buniyadi dhaancha or navachaar par purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke salaahkaar kii jimmedaari nibhaai he
 In the same year, he has left the post of Information Technology Advisor, Government of Odisha
 duusare kai logon ke ulat nehru-gandhi parivaar ke saath unka judaav saalon se jas kaa tas kaayam he
 Although Rahul is almost three decades younger than him, he calls him by his first name
 congress ke kai yuva netaa rahul gandhi kii chhavi main aae haal ke badlaav kaa shrey pitroda ko dete hai
 It is said that the president of the party's foreign affairs had 'arranged' Rahul's speeches in many places of America
 party ne gujarat main pitroda ko do vajahon se utaara he
 She is Gujarati and has an icon appeal among urban young voters
 yahi vah ilaaka he jahaan bhaajapa ne paaramparik taur par congress ke mukaable behatar pradarshan kiya he
 He did his schooling from Vallabh Vidyanagar in the state and then went to the Engineering College in Vadodara
 pitroda philhal paanch shaharon—vadodara, ahmedabad, rajkot, jamnagar or surat kaa daura kar rahe hai or yah jaanane kii koshish kar rahe hai ki shahari gujarati congress se kya ummid karte hai
 According to the plan, talks are being held with small businessmen, workers and women and it is likely that the advice received from them will be included in the election manifesto
 pitroda ko us team kaa prabharee banaaya gaya he jo 'janata kaa ghoshnaptr' taiyaar karegi or jisamen shiksha, swasthya, chote or majhole udhyamiyon, rojgaar srijan tathaa paryaavaran sangrakshan par jor diya jayega
 To make an impact in the matter, Pitroda Gandhi's name has also been started
 yah bekaar bhi nahin ja rahi
 He attacked the Gujarat government for closing the school in which Mahatma Gandhi had gone
 modi ke gujarat model kaa zikr kiye bagaiyr pitroda unke sabase asardaar chunavi naare yani vikaas par pradhanmantri se morcha le rahe hai
 They are not in favor of the 'american model driven by big projects'
 ve shgramin vikaas, kisaanon or choti pariyojnaon par gandhivadi jorya dene ke himachati hai
 The party is deliberately targeting youth below 35 years and its two internal surveys have said that one of the reasons for students' displeasure with the state government is the high cost of education
 pitroda is maamle main bhi aawaaj buland karte hai, ''gujarat main shiksha ko nijee haathon main saunpna bada mudda he
 Students have been forced to pay hefty fees
 ''akeli chook (he to) ab tak yahi ki prachaar-prasar ke ek aujaar ke taur par soshal media kii bhoomika ke prati berukhi barti gai he
 That too when Rahul has got a new story

 Till now the names and numbers of fake toppers were revealed, but it has exposed the connivance of Bihar board and the case's kingpin Amit Singh alias Bacha Rai
 sarkaar kii exiaar ke mutabik inter kaa first topper saurabh shreshth nahin balki shalini raay he, jo baccha raay kii beti he
 No Shalini's name in the board's toppers list, when the board listed Jabopops, Shalini's name was not there
 shiksha vibhaag ne jo exiaar patna ke kotwali main darj kii he uske tisare pej main saaf taur par pehle topper ke naam kii jagah par shalini kaa naam likhaa he
 Saurabh Shrestha is named as the second topper and Rahul is named as the fourth topper
 toppers list main board ne shalini kaa naam kyon nahin diya?darasal pehle se hi radar par maujuudvishun raay college ke sarvecervmit singh urf baccha raay kii beti ne inter main bhi top kiya tha, lekin uskaa naam aate hi hangaamaa much jaataa
 Hence his name was hidden
 toppers list ke duusare naam yani saurabh shreshth ke naam se shuru hui
 When the authorities started investigating after the revelation of Aaj Tak, Shalini not only got the highest number but she is also a science topper
 beti kaa naam aate hi hangaamaa ho jaataa isliye uskaa naam dabaa diya gaya
 Shalini's name at the beginning of the FIR itself, the government has started the FIR in the name of Shalini, in view of the furore caused by the Inter result
 is exiaar main saaf taur par shalini raay ke bare main likhaa he ki wo science main topper thi or uskicopy main puri tarah se chhedchhadkiya gaya he
 The number has been written after tearing the number of its copy
 toppers list jari karne main bhi manamanidansal na sirf topper banane main ghotaalaa hua he balki toppers list ko jari karne main bhi manamaani kii gai he
 Shalini Rai, who was the topper of entire Bihar in matriculation in 2014, has also topped the inter, but for fear that there will be no uproar and the whole distinction is revealed
 is baar inter main uske rigelt ko rokkar toppers list jari kii gai
 The toppers list changed after the revelations, now the fake toppers list has also been changed after the revelations
 yani farji toppers kii suchi main ab shalini kaa naam sabase upar he
 Saurabh is the second fake topper of the best science
 rahul kumaar tisare se ludhakkar chauthe number par aa gaya he
 According to the website, Shalini did not give the test, it is that in the FIR, Shalini Rai has been told to be the first topper, but when her roll number and roll code is inserted on the website, it appears that she did not take the exam
 sawaal ye he ki agar rigelt ke mutabik usne pariksha nahin di to uskaa rigelt kaise or kahaan se aayaa, kaise use bihar kaa topper qaraar diya gaya or kaise uski copy saamne aa gai?sarkaar ke haath lagi shalini kii copidrasal sarkaar ko is puure farjivade kii bhanak lag chuki thi
 The board had set up its own inquiry committee in a hurry to hide this fraud
 baad main ise bhang bhi kar diya gaya
 When the government got a copy of Shalini Rai in hand, Nitish Kumar decided that instead of an investigation, the conspiracy would be investigated by filing a criminal case directly
 central board of secondary ajukeshan (CBSE) kii ore se yojit hui 12veen kampartmental pariksha kaa rigelt 6 agast 2015 ko ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he

 rigelt dekhne ke liye students ko sibiesai kii oficial website par janaa hoga
 There they will get a link to the 12th compartmental result
 is link par clic karne ke baad unhen apana role number daalkar rigelt dekhnaa hoga
 Around 97,404 students took this exam
 desh kii rajdhani dilli main ravivaar ko bhari dupahari main logon kii ankhon ke saamne ek vaardaat hone vaali thi
 But it could not happen
 kyonki us vaardaat ko un chaukanni nigahon ne hone se bachaa liya, jin par dilli ko naaj he
 At around 2 in the afternoon, a girl and a boy arrived on the stairs at the other end of the footover bridge of Sarita Vihar metro station
 ladki matamaile rang kaa top or kaali genes pahane hui thi
 While the boy in black shirt and white pants was at some distance behind him
 ladki brij par pahunchakar sidhiyon ke nazadik kone main railing se tikkar khadi ho jaati he
 Whereas the boy following him does not stop there but instead goes ahead
 brij par logon kii awajahi kam jarur he
 But one and two people come and go
 magar un sabase bekhbar ladki vahiin usee jagah par khadey hokar brij se neeche kii taraf dekhati he
 One of the people passing close to the girl definitely looks at the girl
 kyonki dopaher ke vakt dhoop main koi ladki is tarah pul par kyon khadi he or wo bina kuch kahe apane raste par aage bad jaataa he
 After some time, the same black shirt boy appears again from the metro station amidst the movement of people
 wo dhire dhire chalata hua sidhaa ladki ke paas jaakar ruk jaataa he
 Unaware of the movement of people, the two start talking among themselves
 kuch der baat karne ke baad ladkaa usee sidhiyon se utar kar chalaa jaataa he
 The stairs through which he followed the girl came to the bridge
 ladke ke vahaan se jane ke baad bhi ladki vahiin khadi rahati he or kaaphi der tak brij se neeche kii taraf dekhati rahati he
 After a while, the girl suddenly appears to act
 wo apane donon pair railing par tikaati he
 While the girl is standing with her feet on the railing, another young man passing right behind her stands on the front railing
 ladki chupchaap sidhiyon se chadhakar aa rahe ek rahgeer ko dekhati he or khamosh hokar khadi ho jaati he
 As soon as the passer-by passes through, the boy standing on the railing on the other side moves from his place and moves towards the stairs
 tabhi ladki kii harakat sabhi ko buree tarah chaunkaa detii he
 She appears to be trying to cross the railing by stepping over the railing
 jis vakt ladki railing paar karne kii koshish kar rahi thi brij se teen log guzar rahe the
 Two girls and a young man while a boy standing near the stairs were looking down
 dekhte hi dekhte ladki railing ko phandane kii koshish karti dikhaai detii he or ek hi jatke main railing se latakane lagati he
 Now the girl turns her back towards the road and face towards the bridge
 ladki ko is haalat main dekhakar brij se guzar rahi do ladakiyon main se ek uske kareeb jaati he or usase kuch baat karti dikhaai detii he
 a girl is seen trying to jump from the bridge while two girls are talking to her
 ye manjar pul par aane jane vaale logon ko apni ore khinchataa he or ek ek karke kai log achaanak vahaan ikattha ho jate hai
 But no one dares to go close to the girl hanging from that railing
 tabhi metro stesan kii taraf se ek vardi vaala bhaagta hua aage badhata nazar aata he or us jawan ke peeche ek or vardi vaala usee taraf aage badhata he
 The CISF jawan rapidly passes through the crowd and reaches close to the girl and in one stroke grabs the hand of the girl hanging from the railing
 haath pakadte hi wo jawan us ladki ke kareeb brij par gira hua us ladki kaa hi koi saamaan uthaata he or us jawan ke peeche aa rahaa doosraa jawan bhi apane saathi kaa saath dene uske kareeb pahunch jaataa he
 Seeing two uniforms trying to save a girl from the condition of hanging from the railing, the bridge gets a lot of fun
 vardi vaala wo jawan railing se lataki hui ladki ko khinchakar brij ke upar laata he tabhi ek mahila sipaahi bhi usee disha main badhati dikhaai dene lagati he
 The woman soldier reaches close to her comrades, grabs the hand of the girl and starts walking towards the metro station
 ab aap jaananaa chaahate honge ki aakhir ye ladki koun he? wo kyon pul se kud kar jaan dena chaahati thi
 Who was the boy who left him to die? And the biggest question is, how did the CISF personnel know that the girl is about to jump from the bridge? Who is that girl and where is she going to live
 uski badanaami na ho isliye ham uski pahchaan kaa khulaasa nahin kar sakate
 Just understand like this
 wo ladki rajdhani kii hi rahane vaali he or apane beoyafriend ke saath yahaan pahunchi thi
 But at some point, the two had a fight and after the same fight, his boy friend left from there
 shaayad use bhi is baat kaa andaja nahin tha ki ladki pul se kudane kii bhi koshish kar sakati he
 He probably left her alone in this guise and went away from there, that the girl like him too will leave from there after some time
 lekin siaisef ke javaanon ko kaise pataa chalaa ki brij par khadi ladki kudane vaali he
 Like all other metro stations in Delhi, the CISF personnel take care of the safety of Sarita Vihar Metro Station
 metro stesan or uske ird gird koi haadasa yaa vaardaat dastak na de sake, iske liye stesan ke chappe chappe par nazar rakhane ke liye baqayada sisitivi camere bhi lagaae gaye hai
 And in the control room built at the station, the CISF personnel also keep monitoring the pictures of CCTV cameras
 sisitivi camere kii tasveeron kii monitering ke dauraan siaisef ke javaanon ne jab footover brij par ladki ko kaaphi der tak akele khadey dekha to unhen shaq hua
 So those people looked at each of his actions
 or jaise hi unhen laga ki ladki brij se kud bhi sakati he
 So at the last moment the CISF jawan reached the spot and saved him from having an accident along with a life in time
 desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 congress or tidipi donon ko raajnneetik phayda hota dikh rahaa he
 However, it is believed that after the election both parties will come together
 andhra pradesh congress adhyaksh raghuveera reddy ne kaha ki aagaamee chunaavon main congress rajya main kisi bhi party ke saath koi gathbandhan nahin karke chunaav ladegi
 The Congress will contest on 175 seats in Andhra Pradesh and 25 Lok Sabha seats on its own in the forthcoming elections and will not be aligned with the TDP
 tidipi ne siyaasi haalat ko samajhakar gathbandhan na karne kaa faisla kiya
 In Andhra Pradesh, the Reddy and Kammas are considered to be politically important
pabba Suresh Babu, a noted journalist from andhra pradesh ke varisht patrkaar pabba suresh babu kehete hai ki raajnneetik taur par donon samudaay ek duusare ke virdohi hai
 Reddy is the Congress's main bank, while TDP is based among the Kamma community
 pradesh kii siyasat main congress or tidipi ek duusare ke virdohi rahe hai
 He said that if the congress-tdp entered the electoral arena by alliance, the Reddy community would shift to Jagan Mohan Reddy's party instead of Congress
 iske alaava tidipi sarkaar ke khilaaf jo satta virdohi vot he wo bhi congress kii bajaay jagan ke saath jane kaa khatra he
 Realizing this, both of them have decided not to contest elections by alliance
 jabaki donon partiyon ke bich friendli fite hogi
 Let me tell you that NT Rama Rao formed TDP due to the Congress being close to the Reddy community
 antiaar kamma samudaay se aate the or chandrababu naidu bhi isi samudaay se aate hai
 Suresh says that the BJP is eyeing the vote of the Reddy community, as this community is considered to be quite Hindutva
 jabaki reddy samudaay soft hote hai
 Let the Congress leaders of Telangana demand Rahul Gandhi to break the alliance with TDP
 vah nahin chaahate the ki donon partiyaan milakar chunaav laden
 In the Telangana assembly elections, the Congress suffered a loss due to alliance with the TDP, it has come down from 21 to 19 seats

 Whenever this name emerges on the golden screen of our mind, similarly a peculiar smile comes on our lips
 college ke un dinon ko yaad karke shaayad hi koi hoga jisaki ankhon main un dinon kii befricri ko dobaaraa jeene kii lalak naa dikhti ho
 After coming to the race to make money, make money and make a career, it came to know that some beautiful moments of life have been left behind, which will be the joy of living again, probably till the last heartbeat
 chaahe aaj ham koi bhi naukari kar rahe hon, desh-videsh ke kisi bhi kone main rah rahe hon, hajaaron, lakhon, karodon se khel rahe hon, lekin college ke dinon kii kuch aisi baaten hai jo bhulaae nahin bhuulati yaa yun kahen ki ham un baton ko kabhi bhoolanaa nahin chaahate
 There are many small memories that we want to cherish
 aisi hi kuch yaaden hai jinhen hamane pirone kii koshish kii he
 Who can forget that first day of college, the first day of college
 skool ke baad ghar se mili aazaadee kii khushi manaane kaa din jo tha
 Our every move towards college on that day used to increase heartbeat even more
 khushi or ghabrahat kii cocktail liye college campus main ghusna aaj bhi bhulaae nahin bhuulataa
 That first class of college
 
 
 wo bhi kya din tha
 Life seemed very lonely that day among the new faces
 lekin ye nahin pataa tha ki aane vaale kuch dinon main ye saare chehre hi hamaari jindagi kaa ahm hissaa ban jaaenge
 More than attending the first class, the focus of the boys was on the number of girls in the class, according to the ratio
 haalanki pehle din isse zyada research karne kii himmat bhi nahin thi
 The first crush of college, the first crush of college, after seeing it, we heard the voice of the violin from behind like in films
 sab kuch yashraj films kii romantic film kii tarah ho rahaa tha
 His white salwar suit and red dupatta still touches our hearts with a sigh of memories
 (note: yahaan 'pehla' shabd kaa prayog isliye kyonki krash to bahut hua lekin har baar dil krash hi hua
 ) That first proposal and datebus bus of the college
 
 
 bahut filmi baaten ho gayi
 Now was the time for action
 use dekh liya, vylan bhi baj gaye, pyaar bhi ho gaya lekin ab baari thi 'mishan pehla pyaar' ko launch karne kii
 But before that it was to find out whether the girl is single or committed
 ghanghor research ke baad hamaare doston ne bataaya kii 'bhabhi' abhi bhi single hai
 Then what was there
 
 
 pahunch gaye dil ko fadafadaate ham unke saamne or rakh diya prapojal hameshaa ke liye ek ho jane kaa
 After the proposal was accepted, the heart was filled with confidence and the elderly lovers started to remember that 'I have a great desire to get you with great courage
 
 
 ki har jarre ne tumse milaane kii sajeesh kii he
 'well here the matter was being dated earlier, then let's focus back on it
 pehle date ke din pataa chalaa ki iskaa sidhaa conection pet se hota he
 Even if you are not a daily customer of Mohan Chapatiwala, the street owner of your locality, but what is the date in which you do not take your beloved in expensive restaurants and do belly worship
 us daur main ye sabase zyada dardanaak tha
 But what to do about love that happens blind
 wo pehali baar dil tootnacolege ke dinon kaa sabase dardanaak lamhaa
 That first crush 'crushed' the heart so badly that it took several days to assemble its pieces
 pataa chalaa, hamaare doston kii 'bhabhi' ne kisi senior kaa haath tham liya he
 The anger of friends was also on the boil
 us din hamaare doston ne bhi khaanaa nahin khaaya
 This was the moment when friends came closer
 'phir agle din dil ke mohalle main aishwarya aegi' ye sochakar ham sab ne aage badhane kaa faisla kiya
 When she used to sing a song in the college canteen of the canteen of the college, she also used to play table and it seemed that no rockstar was born bigger than us

 The meeting point of all friends after bunking the college gardenclass or finishing the class
 jahaan ek se ek idia generat karne kii koshish kii jaati thi
 All the think tanks gathered in one place and tried to solve every kind of issue
 college kaa wo hostelek aisi jagah jahaan ham raat ko jagate the or subah 10 baje tak sote the
 The first class must have missed many times
 ek room main ikatthe hokar guitar kii dhun par naachna, gunagunaanaa
 Every night spent there is still present in the mind
 college kii khubasurat professorcolege kii ek aisi hasti jise dekh kar ye mahasoos hota tha, kaash kuch saal pehle paidaa ho gaye hote
 The class of that beautiful faculty was not left under any circumstances
 chaahe kisi bhi subject kaa asinament taiyaar ho naa ho lekin 'unke' asinament ko jarur puraa karte the
 They did not give him any chance to get angry
 us khubasurat faikalti kii muskaan aaj bhi bhulaae nahin bhuulati
 a unique place: During the days of Library College, this unique place has had the least connection
 isliye iske bare main zyada baat nahin ho paaegi
 Girls used to use this place the most
 haa, class banks karne ke baad ye jagah sabase sef maani jaati thi
 During the days of Xerox Machine College, this is the most money spent on it
 are baba, nots xerox karaane main
 The biggest advantage of going to the girls library was that she used to make point to point notes of every subject and the boys saved their precious time by getting her xerox
 wo sasti woletchaahe keemat kii baat ho yaa uske andar rakhe gaye keemat kii, donon hi maamalon main un dinon hamaare wolet saste hi hua karte the
 Sometimes 20, sometimes 2000, the money fluctuated like the stock market
 lekin himmat itani hoti thi ki kisi dost ko paise kii kami mahasoos hone nahin dete the
 Friends were with us when we needed them, and when we needed them
 doston kii berthde partibhai saab
 
 asal celibrasion to isi din hota tha
 Even though the number of kicking bombs on birthdays has reduced but in those days birthdays used to get so much that it was difficult to sit for two days
 doston kaa hamase chhupaakar kek laana or phir thik raat 12 baje puure mohalle main sirf hamaari hi aawaaj gujanna
 It used to be the beginning of our birthday
 doston ko khilaane main do maheene kaa bajet hill jaataa tha lekin kamabakht dost ek gift tak nahin dete the
 a ripe friend is definitely a ripe type of friend in one's list of friends
 jo kabhi daaru pine ke baad angreji bol bol kar pakaata he, kabhi dil tuutane par rota he to kabhi paise naa hone ke bahaane karata he
 But despite millions of shortcomings, he is also very dear to all of us
 college ko wo aakhri dinakhir main wo din bhi aa gaya jiske bare main yaad kar ke aaj bhi ankhen nam ho jaati hai
 On that day, do not forget to forget all the joys of hugging once by putting aside all the grievances
 is vaade ke saath ki saal main ek baar jarur milenge, contact banaae rakhenge
 Although many had made promises, but after so many years, very few people have been able to fulfill them
 us din sab yahi kah rahe the ki kaash ham is college main hameshaa ke liye rah jate, yun hin saath-saath
 Come on, sir
 
 
 bahut yaad kar liya aapane apane college ke dinon ko
 Now Minimize this page and start your work, otherwise the boss will come back from behind
 sach, kitna haseen tha wo pal jahaan choti choti chijen bhi hamen ek ajeeb si khushi de jaati thi or aaj unheen baton ko ham apana bachapanaa kah kar taal dete hai

 Those who landed on the land here, they adopted the methods here
 bombai ko badalane kii jagah unhone bombai ko unhen badalane diya
 Bombay introduced scenes, noise and experiences which were not present in any other Indian city

 Here you did not have to be something, you could become something

 Bombay was a strange confluence that formed its own language, created its own cultural communities
 yahaan varg, jati, ling yaa bank khate main rakam chaahe jo ho, har koi har vakt apane ekant dadbe main gum hone kii bajaae shahar main hi laga rahata tha
 Gregory David Roberts wrote in Shantaram, "there will be more dreams, breaks and truths in Hindustan than elsewhere in Bombay
" yah nayakon or khalnaayakon, kirdaar or sanvaadon, sangeet or geeton, chand or dhunon kii dharti thi
 Living in Bombay meant celebrating it, knowing it, loving it
 magar bombai, yaa jo ab baahar waalon ke liye bhi mumbai ho gai he, puratakalif tabdili se guzar rahi he
 a city in which the place is torn apart, which is crumbling with its joints, and which has long spread towards the sky

 This reimagining of private and public spaces has resulted in a competition of convenience and proximity, with communities gradually mobilizing against each other

 This has given rise to quarrels over constructive competition rather than being small and has made local residents stand out against the Bahirites, Hindus as Muslims and the rich as middle class
 yah kai ghatnaon se jaahir ho rahaa he
 For example, an attack on the face of Sudhindra Kulkarni, an uproar in the BCCI office for playing cricket with Pakistan

 khuli jagahon ke sikudde ke natijatan logon kaa shahar se milanaa-julna or bhi kam ho gaya
 You still see industrialists, intellectuals, actors and sportsmen walking in the evening and mingling anonymously among the crowd on the vast open Marine Drive along the sea
 magar aise drishy bhi ab aam nahin rah gaye hai
 In some ways, Bombay itself has been deceived by its own residents
 pichley dashak ke dauraan aam taur par har cheez kaa darja gira he
 Infrastructure, open spaces, social interaction and interaction between communities, entrepreneurship, means of transportation, health services, nighttime colors, what to eat and where to live
 is giravat ko logon ne manjuur kar liya he
 The lifestyle and values that the city used to have declined
 isamen koi shaq nahin ki bombai kii phijaaon main baghawat kaa ek tevar he
 The bjp-led government imposed a general ban on beef in the state seven months ago, but buffalo meat is being sold secretly across the city
 dance baron par pabandi to abhi 15 aktubar ko supreme court ne hataai he, magar pabandi ke in puure 10 saal ke dauraan ve shahar ke chhipe hue konon main chalate rahete the
 This is also unfortunate, because Bombay was a city in India where you did not have to revolt for small freedoms: where all you did was openly, not covertly
 bombai kii sabase badi aadchan shaayad yah he ki baaki hindustan ne khaasi tarakkee kii he or ooncha uthaa he
 Earlier people who used to come here from outside came from such places which were economically and socially backward

 Today cities across India are going ahead
 multiplex, mal, pub, kaanch kii deevaaron vaali oonchi imaaraten, nae kaarobaar or kism-kism kii naukariyaan ab har jagah hai
 Mumbai has failed to push itself forward and hence she no longer feels special
 apane usulon kii lakeer par chalane kii ichha teji se gaayab ho rahi he
 As the mind of Mumbai is closing, the mind of India is opening up to such an extent that both are moving towards being equal to each other
 bombai vividhta se hatakar ab dhire-dhire saarvbhaum shahari aabaadi ke kabje main ja rahi he, jiske purvaagrah, ashishnutaa or bechainiyaan vahiin hai jinase baaki bharat pareshaan he
 While many arguments have been made about the special metros around the world, the German sociologist Jörg Siemel has said an eye-opener that what makes the metros great? He wrote, "the metropolis reveals itself as one of those great historical textures in which conflicting currents that gather life in one place open and at the same time connect with each other with equal rights
" '' bharat main bombai aisa hi ek sahakaari shahar tharu ek hi vakt par udasin bhi or antarang bhi
 a dialogue from Anurag Kashyap's 2015 film Bombay Velvet makes a very good statement that what is known in Bombay is "what is the address outside Bombay?" India! ”in the next few pages, a number of celebrities from different fields: each of whom has a strong connection to Bombay: will examine today's Bombay, tell where it is going, what it has lost and how it can get it back
 Can
 kyonki kabhi ek bombai hua karti thi
 When will the second Bombay be like that? rajya sabha ke liye 58 nae sadasyon or ek seat ke liye upachunaav kii prakriya desh ke 16 rajyon main jari he
 Elections are being held for 25 seats in these 58 seats in 6 states while 33 members from 10 states are reaching Rajya Sabha without any protest
 lekin rajya sabha chunaav ke antim nateezon se desh kii raajnneeti kis karavat baithegi, kya loksabhaa kii tarah rajya sabha main bhi bijepi apana varchasv banaaegi? yadi nahin to rajya sabha kii maujuuda sthiti kaa kya asar 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon par padegaa?'rajya sabha ke in chunaavon ke baad sadan kii badali ankaganit main bijepi ko 15 siton tak kaa phayda ho saktaa he
 With this advantage, BJP will increase the figure of the current 58 members to 72-73
 haalanki yah aankada rajyasabha main bahumat ke liye jaruri 123 siton se kaaphi neeche he
 Significantly, after the current elections, the Congress will have to lose about 8 to 10 seats and in the Rajya Sabha its figure will come down from 54 to about 45
 lihaaja, is sthiti main ek baat saaf he ki maujuuda loksabhaa ke kaarykaal main bijepi ko rajyasabha main bahumat nahin milegaa
 For this, once again he will have to lead in the assembly elections in 2018 and 2019, with a strong majority in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 aisi sthiti main bijepi ke liye 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle apane hidutv agenda kaa saath pakadana aasaan nahin hoga
 As a result, once again in the next general elections, he will have to campaign only with promises
 ise padhein: bhaajapa kaa 'antaratma style', har chunaav main jod-tod kii siyasatbijepi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main vikaas ke agenda ke saath-saath apane hindutv ke agenda ko badhaane kaa vaada kiya tha
 After the election results, when a strong Modi government was formed at the Center, the party pushed forward policies of fast development to bring good days
 ab jab 2019 ke aam chunaav main mahaj ek saal kaa vakt bachaa he, tej vikaas aarthik aankadon se gaayab he or bijepi ke achche din ke saamne vahi sawaal khadey ho rahe hai jo atal bihari vaajapeyi ke shining india ke saamne the
 In such a situation, the BJP had the option of going back to the Hindutva agenda but due to the absence of majority in the Rajya Sabha yet, the Modi government would not even get a chance to go on its Hindutva agenda for the next one year
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ne beeche kai dashakon se hindutv agenda kii baat kii he
 For this agenda, during the last 4 years, the Modi government has drafted the removal of the Uniform Civil Code, Section 370, and to conduct the Lok Sabha as well as the assembly elections across the country
 lekin in sabhi masaudon par aage badhane ke liye samvidhan main sanshodhan kii jarurat he jiske liye yah jaruri he ki bijepi ko loksabhaa ke saath-saath rajya sabha main vishesh bahumat mili
 To live up to the Hindutva agenda, it is also necessary that the BJP has a special majority government in at least 15 states
 haalanki maujuuda samay main bijepi ke 15 rajyon main mukhyamantri ke saath-saath 21 rajyon main gathbandhan kii sarkaar he
 But in the event of the possibility of a majority in the Rajya Sabha after the 2019 elections, this figure can also be seen to change
 gauratlab he ki jahaan haryana, jammu-kashmir, jharkhand or maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav 2019 ke aam chunaavon ke turant baad honge vahiin andhrapradesh, arunachal pradesh, odisha, sikkim or telugana kaa chunaav loksabhaa chunaavon ke saath karaayaa jayega
 Apart from this, assembly elections of Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram and Rajasthan will be held in 2018 just before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 in chunaavon ke baad yadi kendra main bijepi ko loksabhaa or rajyasabha main vishesh bahumat ke saath-saath 15 rajyon main do-tihaai bahumat vaali sarkaar rahegi tab modi sarkaar ke liye hindutv ke agenda par kargar faisla liya ja sakegaa
 See the speed of havoc with the camera's eyes
 yakeen maniye phir zindagi main aap kabhi raftaar se pyaar nahin karenge
 There is one such expressway just 28 kilometers from Delhi
 jahaan raftaar ke naa jane kitne hi rang hai
 But those colors did not know how many lives were changed
 ab tak ek hazaar se zyada log yahaan raftaar kaa shikaar hokar maare ja chuke hai
 In which the number of injured is different
 log in haadason se sabak len or expresve par sanbhal kar chalem
 It is nice to see the Taj Mahalgreatter Noida Expressway near Delhi
 yani dilli se mahaj 28 kilometre dur aath len kii shandaar sadak
 Road that reduced the distance from Delhi to Agra
 wo sadak jisane tajmahal ko dilli ke or kareeb laa diya
 The road that is now directly touching Lucknow
 or agar ye kahen ki ye sadak is root par chalane vaali trainon ko bhi takkar de rahi he, to ye galat nahin he
 Dreadful pictures of the express way Bhimnagar is also another awesome picture of this magnificent express
 tasviir raftaar se nikali kahar kii
 The picture is to make the vehicles on Formula One on eight lanes and to make life to death by riding on the thrill of photo speed
 kahin beqaabu car express ve par achaanak kalabaziyaan khaane lagati he
 Somewhere the wavy SUV suddenly overturns and goes on the other side of the road
 kahin sidhi sadak par bhaagti car complasri turn par bhi sidhi rahati he or divyder par chali jaati he
 Somewhere after a terrible accident, vehicles are burning up and elsewhere
 beqaabu raftaar ke chalate palati car ke parakhche ud jate hai
 Pictures of the Accidents Captured in CCTV Between the vehicles galloping on the road, the photos of these accidents would not have been in front of us and you if the CCTV cameras installed on the Expressway had not captured them
 kya pataa un tasveeron ko dekh kar hi log sabak le len
 And whenever Aida passes through the Expressway, remember this in your mind
 yaad rakhen ki khatarnaak raftaar kii vajah se kahin agali tasviir unheen kii gaadi kii naa ho
 The first picture of a speeding death on a sliding car on a wet road
 abhi-abhi is jagah par barish hui he
 The entire road is filled with water and the vehicles are passing by splashing water
 isi bich tej raftaar or geeli sadak kii vajah se ek car achaanak sadak par phisalane lagati he
 But because the speed is very fast, the driver is unable to control his car even though he wants to, and uncontrollable, unbridled cars start eating somersaults on the road itself
 maut ke munh main samaa jate hai logek do teen chaar
 With every acrobat, the screws of death are further tightened on those in the car
 haalat ye hoti he ki car palatati hui divyder tod kar upar ja chadhati he or phir kuch der main ladkadhaata hua ek shaks car se baahar nikalataa he or badahavaas hokar vahiin baith jaataa he
 Whereas according to the news, some others are riding in the car and at the same time, the moment they die
 bekaabu SUV main savaar logon kii dardanaak mautek or tasviir bhi raftaar se upje maut kii gavaahi detii he
 An SUV is running wildly on the road, and just like the first picture, here too, this SUV suddenly comes out unscathed
 sadak par hi khatarnaak tareeqe se kalabaziyaan khaane lagati he
 And by the time this chain stops, the SUV also turns into a four-wheeled coffin
 is haadase me gaadi main savaar sabhi logon kii dardanaak maut ho jaati he
 The pictures of the car fly away
 The next picture is even more shocking
 car chalaate hue neend aane ke kisse to aapane bahut sune honge, lekin kya kabhi kisi ko car chalaate hue achaanak hi so jate dekha he? agar nahin, to in tasveeron main dekh lijie
 This car is running at full speed on the long and direct express way
 chunki sadak bilkul sidhi he, excilator dabaaye rakhane ke sivaay driver ke paas koi kaam nahin he
 But as if the straight road suddenly takes all the people sitting in this car to death
 dur se chali aa rahi car sadak ke mudane par bhi nahin mudati
 That is, on the compulsory turn, the car goes straight and the result is that the car goes off the road and collides with the divider and on seeing it, the children of the car fly away
 haadase baad jalane lagati hai kai karenhaadase kii tasviren to galaa sukhaane vaali hai
 After a collision of several vehicles simultaneously, a car has turned into a fireball and is burning
 aas-paas maujuud log chatapata rahe hai
 Trying to extinguish the fire and take out those trapped in the car
 lekin yahaan bich sadak par naa to logon ke paas itani badi aag par qaabu paane kaa koi intazaam he or naa hi bachaav kaa koi tareeqa
 In such a situation, they have no choice but to wait till the fire brigade arrives
 lekin jab tak damakal kii gaadi yahaan pahunchati he, der ho chuki hoti he
 This sedan also becomes a victim of speed on this express of death
 achaanak bekaabu hokar palatati he or maut ban jaati he

 mangalvaar ko adaalat ne aaropee amar singh kii jamaanat par faisla buudhvaar tak ke liye surakshit rakh liya tha, jabaki antarim jamaanat ek din ke liye badha di

 In the Hindi entertainment industry after Hollywood, many people have voiced their objections under the # metoo campaign
 tanushridatta ke saamne aane ke baad duusari peediton ne bhi saalon se chipa dard duniya ke saamne rakhana shuru kiya he
 The # metoo movement has so far fallen on celebs like Nana Patekar, Vikas Bahl, Alok Nath, Chetan Bhagat, Rajat Kapoor, Utsav Chakraborty and Tanmay Bhatt
 cerviver ko logon or celebrities kaa saport mil rahaa he
 Changes in the approach of people and institutions are also seen after the movement has gained momentum
 jiskaa sabase bada saboot CINTAA he
 This can be understood by cintaa's stand in Tanushree's case
 sintaaj mumbai main ahm baithak kar rahaa he
 a tough verdict is expected against the accused
 meri dost ke pati ne sharaab main dawa dekar kiya rape, produsar kii aapbeeteedekhane ko mil rahaa he ki # metoo campan ke cerviveron ke khilaaf celebs bolne se batch rahe hai
 So either the celebs are condemning the accused in this case or they are keeping silence
 digitigeshan se yon shoshan or chhedchhad kii shikaar hui mahilaon ko kaaphi madad mili he
 Let's know how # metoo has changed the atmosphere in the entertainment industry
 tanushri-naanaa vivaad par phir se jaanch ko taiyaar CINTAA2008 main jabananaa patekardwara tanushri ke saath chhedchhad or marpet kii gai thi tab CINTAA ke paas ye maamla gaya tha
 Tanushree filed a complaint with Sinta
 lekin kadi karrwai nahin kii gai
 Now after 10 years, when this matter has arisen again, Sinta first expressed grief on this matter
 CINTAA ne kaha, "ham tanushri ke saath hai lekin is cese ko dobaaraa nahin kholaa ja saktaa, kyonki ve 3 saal se zyada purana cese nahin lete hai
 "the people raging on Alok Nath, the celebs also vented anger on Sanskari Babu, however, due to the outspokenness of the people on Meetu, now the attitude of CINTAA has also softened
 ve cese kii phir se jaanch karne ko taiyaar hai
 Cinta's attempt to accept her mistake is seen as the beginning of major change
 peedit ko bharosa hua # metoo campan ke tool pakadaney ke baad yon shoshan or chhedchhad se peedit mahilaon ko bada saport mila he
 Earlier women were afraid to tell this bad act that happened to them
 unhen dar hota tha ki samaaj unhen hi galat tehraayega, aawaaj uthaane se unki hi badanaami hogi
 They will be isolated, but now through social media, they are sharing their opinions freely
 isaki sabase badi vajah ye bhi he ki log peeditaaon ke jakhmon par yakeen kar rahe hai
 After 10 years Nana on Tanushree case- 'lawyer said that is why i am silent' They have been isolated after the development of director Vikhal Bahlka's name appeared in the Vikas Bahl # metoo campaign
 bombai velvet ke pramotional tour ke dauraan film kii kru main shaamil mahila ne unpar chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The woman had also complained to Anurag Kashyap of Phantom Films
 lekin is puri ghatana par koi karwai nahin hui
 Anurag Kashyap of Phantom Films, Vikramaditya Motwani, regretted seeing the matter grow
 kaha ki tab ham sahi se is mudde ko handle nahin kar sake
 Both Anurag and Vikramaditya have opted out of Vikas Bahl
 ruthik ne bhi vikaas ko aade haath liya he
 Hrithik is working in Vikas's directorial film Super-30
 unhone likhaa ki main aise insaan ke saath kaam nahin kar saktaa
 It is also being said that Vikas Bahl's name as the director of Super 30 will also be removed
 vikaas se do or projects chhine jane kii khabar he
 a big change has come from the # metoo campaign that the accused are now being swayed
 rajat kapur or chetan bhagat jaise logon ne vivaad badhane se pehle hi maafee maang lee
 Tanushree said after the police that there is no time limit for the sexual harassment of Nana in the Women's Commission, the Union Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi says that sexual harassment complaints can be made even 10 to 15 years after the incident
 unhone # metoo abhiyaan ko lekar apni khushi jaahir kii or kaha ki yah to bas shuruyaat he
 i do not think this campaign will go out of control
 is ghatana se peedita ke andar jo gussa uthta he vah kabhi khatm nahin hota jiske saath yah bitta he vah use kabhi nahin bhula paati
 That is why we have written to the Law Ministry that there should be no time limit to complain about the sexual abuse incident

 And the whole story has been woven around this
 film main ladke kii sexual phantasy ke seen khub filmaae gaye hai or is kaaran punam pandey ko bhi body dikhaane kaa puraa mauka mila he
 If you see this film without comparing Sunny Leone or Sherlyn Chopra, Poonam Pandey will like it, because she herself says that she is not a porn star
 vaise aap film dekhakar khud hi andaja laga sakate hai
 The specialty of the film's sex scenes is that Poonam is seen dominating the hero in them

 Sushant asks Shahid what was the reaction of Meera to this film? Shahid said that 'my wife Meera liked this character very much and she was the first person who asked me to do this film
 usne kaha tha ki ye kirdaar behad shandaar he, tumhen ye kirdaar karnaa hi hoga
 Shahid further said that when this film was made, he also liked this film a lot

 It seems to me that Kabir is a weak character in the film and Preity's character is much stronger

 The bill is wrong on constitutional, moral grounds - Anand Sharmarajya is discussing the Citizenship Amendment bill in the House
 is dauraan congress netaa anand sharma ne kaha, 'aapane kaha yah aitihaasik bill he
 Time will tell how this bill will see history
 is bill ko lekar jaldbaaji kyon ho rahi he, sansadeey cameti ke paas ise bheja jaataa or tab laayaa jaataa
 This is the first time in 72 years that it is worth opposing
 ye bill sanvaidhanik, naitik aadhaar par galat he, ye bill prastaavna ke khilaaf he
 This bill is going to be distributed to the people
 anand sharma ne kaha ki assam main aaj bachche sadak par kyon hai, jo ditension centre banaaya gaya he to vahaan parasarvadaleey pratinidhimandalko bhejnaa chahie
 a political party's manifesto cannot be the country's constitution
 assam main aaj log jal rahe hai, unke man main asuraksha he lekin aap puure desh main NRC laane kii baat kah rahe hai
 Anand Sharma said that nothing will happen by taking the name of gandhi-patel, if Sardar Patel would have been very angry if he met PM Modi
 
 Gandhi's spectacles are not just for advertising
 congress netaa ne kaha ki abhi tak 9 sanshodhan aae, goa, daman-div, pudducheri, yugara,srilanka, kenya se aae logon ko bharat kii naagarikta di gai
 The Prime Minister of the country was also Atal Bihari Vajpayee for 6 years, will he also raise questions on him
 naagarikta dete vakt sansad ne dharm ko aadhaar nahin banaaya, ye bill artical 14 kaa ulanghan he
 Anand Sharma said that your bill fails the constitution test

 On September 9, Swami Vivekananda gave a speech, he said that i belong to a country that gives shelter to people of every religion
 anand sharma bole ki ye bill samvidhan nirmaataaon par sawaal uthaata he, kya unhen iske bare main samaj nahin thi
 No one was discriminated against in the Constitution of India, those who came here after partition have got respect
 pakistan se aae do netaa pradhanmantri bhi bane hai
 The Congress leader said that the Two Nation Theory was not given by the Congress Party, which Savarkar gave in the Hindu Mahasabha meeting
 anand sharma ne kaha ki grih mantri ne bantwaare kaa aarope un congressi netaaon par lagaaya jinhone jail main vakt guzaara, ye raajnneeti band honi chahie
 Anand Sharma said that the Congress opposed the Two Nation Theory, it was also banned

 An accused arrested in Shimla's much-talked-about doll murder and gang-rape case, which was discussed last year, has been sent to judicial custody till May 7
 pichley dinon sibiai ne 25 saal ke is aaropee ko giraftaar kiya tha, jo jangalon main ped kaatane kaa kaam karata he
 The accused has been identified as Anil alias Neelu
 anil urf nilu multah mandi jila ke barot kaa rahane vaala he
 Used to cut trees in Shimla
 sibiai usko lekar shimla ke kotkhai jangal main lekar gai thi, jahaan par 7 july 2017 ko 16 saal kii schuli chaatra gudiya kaa shav baraamad hua tha
 The CBI also questioned some people who were ignored by the Shimla Police
 sibiai ne jab ek ped kaatane vaale majdoor se poochtacha kii, to usne anil kaa naam ugal diya
 After this, the CBI took accused Anil in his custody in time
 jaanch ko bhatakaane or saboot mitaane ke aarope main sibiai ne 8 agast 2017 ko himachal police ke aiji samet aath police waalon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya tha
 Let us tell you that the CBI did not consider the accused arrested by the Shimla police to be criminals and started their investigation afresh
 iske baad hi pulisavaale giraftaar kiye gaye the
 The police is accused of detaining Suraj, an accused Suraj, on the night of August 18
 sibiai is cese main aath baar states report pesh kar chuki he
 The real faces will be Benakabashimla Police arrested the accused named Ashish Chauhan, Rajendra Singh alias Raju, Subhash Singh Bisht, Lokjan, Suraj Singh and Deepak on 12 July 2017
 inako court ne sabooton ke abhaav ke kaaran jamaanat de di thi
 Presently, adding new links to the case, there is hope that soon the real faces of the murderers of the dolls and those involved in the gangrape will be exposed
 jaaniye kya he puraa maamlapichley saal 4 july ko aaropee rajendra urf raju apane dost ashish or subhash ke saath kahin ja rahaa tha
 He saw the doll studying in the 10th and asked to stop the car and give it a lift to the house
 gudiya ilaake main nai ai thi
 Knew Raju vah aksar schuli bacchon ko le jaataa tha, jisase shaq nahin hua
 According to the drunk police, the victim sat in his car
 raju or uske dost sharaab ke nashe main dhut the
 They stopped the car, making an excuse to unload the goods in the middle forest
 maasoom ke saath gangrape kiya
 Three of his colleagues were also called there
 gudiya kii berahami se hatya kar uski laash ko jangal main phenk diya
 During the gang-rape, he testified with humor
 loksabhaa chunaav kii ghoshnaa hone se pehle bhartiya janata party karnataka main jedies-congress sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laane kii taiyaari main he
 The state unit of the BJP has got the green signal for this from the central leadership
 karnataka bhaajapa se jude netaaon kaa kahana he ki rajya main maujuuda gathbandhan sarkaar thik tarah se kaam nahin kar paa rahi he or gathbandhan main foot saaf dikh rahi he
 Many legislators are not present in the budget session even after the JDS and Congress issued whip to their legislators during the budget session in Karnataka Legislative Assembly
 kai vidhayak aise hai jo sarkaar kii taraf se apni upeksha kii shikaayat pratyaksh or paroksh rup se kar rahe hai
 Independent legislators are also unhappy with the functioning of the government
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa or rajya ke purv mukhyamantri bi
 s
 yeddiurppa ke najdiki logon kaa kahana he ki karnataka sarkaar kabhi bhi gir sakati he
 BJP leaders say that people of Congress and JDS are alleging that BJP wants to break their mlas which is not right
 sahi baat yah he ki karnataka kii maujuuda sarkaar khud hi apane vidhayakon ko ekajute nahin rakh paa rahi he
 In such a situation, whenever it seems that the current government has lost majority, it is the responsibility of the BJP as the main opposition party to bring a no-confidence motion
 sutron kaa kahana he ki bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne rajya ikai ko spasht kar diya he ki uski (bhaajapa) kii jimmedaari sarkaar bachaane kii nahin he
 There is no moral or immoral issue to think about to bring down the government or to remove the government by bringing a no-confidence motion

 input: IANS The Election Commission has issued the notice over violation of the Model Code of Conduct by Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu; condemning the statements made by him during election campaign held at Barsoi & Barari of Katihar District in Bihar
 https: / / t
 co / tfd5v52hm3 Sidhu had said in Katihar, 'I have come to warn you, Muslim brothers, they are distributing you, they want to win by dividing people like Owaisi here, by creating a new party
 agar tumlog ikatthe hue, ekajute hokar vot daalaa to modi sulat jayega
 'let us tell you that earlier the Election Commission issued a notice to Navjot Singh Sidhu on Saturday for violating the model code of conduct during an election rally in Katihar, Bihar
 ayog ne notice main katihaar se congress ummidavaar tarik anwar ke samarthan main 15 april ko siddhu dwaara matadaataaon se kii gai apil ke dauraan dharm kaa istemaal kiye jane kaa zikr kiya he
 The Commission had said that the Chief Electoral Officer of Bihar has sent a video clip, in which Sidhu is asking the voters of the minority community not to let the votes be divided
 unhone unase yah bhi kaha ki ve congress ko ekajute hokar vot den, taaki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko satta se ukhaad phenkaa jaae
 The commission has also mentioned an FIR filed against Sidhu's statement at Barsoi police station in Katihar district
 lalu prasad yadav jail main sajaa kaat rahe hai
 This is the first time Lalu Prasad Yadav has stayed away from a rally, in an election
 iskaa nuksaan unki party rashtriya janata dal samet unke sahyogi dalon ko bhi uthaanaa padaa
 The leadership in the election summer was on the shoulders of his son Tejashwi Yadav
 abhi tak chali aa rahi jatigat sameekaran par aadhaarit raajnneeti ne sabhi dalon ko uske hisaab se chunavi maidan main ummidavaar utaarne ko vivash kar diya
 Whether NDA or UPA, no one shied away from that formula
 yadav, bhoomihaar, musalmaan, kurmi, paswan sabhi tarah ke ummidavaaron par maidan main daanv laga or unheen main se janata ne apane kshetra kaa pratinidhi chunaa
 The candidates of coalition of parties like RJD, Congress, HUM, RLSP, VIP also came out of caste-based politics but still could not confront the NDA
 lalu prasad kii anupasthiti, tejasvi kaa netritv yaa tejpratap kaa vidroh, aakhir aisi haar kaa kya kaaran tha?endie apane ummidavaaronki ghoshnaa kar chukaa tha
 The activists were busy campaigning but the Grand Alliance was not able to release the list of their candidates and when the list was released, the RJD and some senior Congress leaders were angered
 naaraaz netaaon ne ghoshnaa kar di ki vah chunaav maidan main rahenge
 Senior Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed landed as an independent candidate from Madhubani and finished third
 darbhanga main mem fatmi jaise varisht netaaon kaa party ko saath nahin mila
 It also affected the workers
 lalu prasad yadav ke bade putr tej pratap yadav ke parivaar se vidroh ne chunavi abhiyaan main mahagathbandhan ko kamjor karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 The seat of Jehanabad could have won the RJD if Tej Pratap Yadav's rebellion had been stopped
 argedy yahaan lachar ravaiya apanaati rahi
 It also affected many other Lok Sabha seats in which Shivhar, Saran Lok Sabha constituency is prominent
 begusarai main maahaul khub banaaya gaya par endie ke aage mahagathbandhan kii ek na chali
 No candidate of the CPI has been able to win this seat in the last five decades, but it is claimed that it is a stronghold of the Left
 yahaan left ke kanhaiya kumaar kaa muqabla rhite ke giriraaj singh se tha
 Prof
 of RJD
 tanwir hasan tisare number par aae
 There was a discussion before the election that Kanhaiya would be the candidate of the opposition but when the names of the candidates were announced, the truth came out a bit more
 isse naa argedy ko phayda hua or naa hi left ko
 The strategy of the grand alliance, in partnership with Kushwaha, Manjhi and Sahni in caste politics, was that the people of this caste would come together, but this mathematics also did not work
 upendra kushvaha, jithan ram maanjhi, mukesh saahani jaise netaa or unki party is samudaay ke logon ko saath laane main naakaamayaab rahe
 All the mathematics of the caste remained intact
 bihar kii raajnneeti main takreeban 20 saal baad aisa pehali baar ho rahaa tha ki loksabhaa chunaav main nitish kumaar or ram vilaas paswan ek saath the
 In 2014, Nitish Kumar's party contested from the NDA and lost
 ramvilas paswan chunaav se thik pehle endie main shaamil hue the or jeet hasil kar sarkaar main bhi shaamil hue the
 Nitish Kumar did not forget the decision taken at the time of his last election
 endie se upendra kushvaha ke jane ke baad nitish kumaar ne bijepi se apni sharton par siten hasil kin or chunaav lade
 Ram Vilas Paswan's party LJP also benefited
 lekin in donon kii ranneeti ne argedy or mahagathbandhan ko dhwast kar diya
 The absence of a well-known leader like Lalu Prasad, who handled the RJD and his allies in this year's Lok Sabha elections in Bihar, also proved to be very damaging
 mahagathbandhan kii haar kii kahani likhane main endie se zyada uske apane netaa hi jimmedaar hai

 As soon as the election comes, the leaders remember the camp and its devotees
 loksabhaa chunaav kii ghoshnaa hote hi punjab or haryana ke darjanon deron main sabhi partiyon ke netaa dastak de rahe hai
 This is common in every election
 kyonki in donon rajyon main dere raajnneetik disha or dasha tay karne main ahm maane jate hai
 Radha Swami Dera, located near Jalandhar in Punjab, is also a good choice of politicians
 loksabhaa chunaav kii ghoshnaa hote hi sabase pehle grahamantri rajnath singh deraa main natmastak hue or uske baad punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh or congress ke rashtriya adhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi deraa pahunche or baba gurinder singh se aashirwad liya
 After the dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim went to jail, politics suddenly started to heat up in the dera
 sutron kii maane to deraa ke political wing main deraa ke bhakton ko saaf-saaf kah diya he ki ab kii baar kise vot dena he
 Congress leaders dreaming of returning to power have already visited Sirsa and attended the camp
 in netaaon main congress ke adhyaksh doctor ashok tanvar bhi shaamil he
 It is estimated that most of the followers of the Dera belong to the Dalit and Backward Classes
 yani dere dalit matadaataaon kaa acha khaasaa vot bank he
 This is the reason that politicians go to the camp to woo the Dalit voters
 is maamle ko lekar jab rajanetaaon se baat kii gai to unke jawaab golmol the
 It is clear that politicians do not want to ban them from going to the camp during elections
 rajaneta deron ke raajnneetikaran ke aaropon ko yah kahkar taal jate hai ki punjab main miri-piri kaa siddhant chalata he
 That is, politics and religion go hand in hand and it is not a bad thing to go to the camp and get the blessings of Baba
 akali dal ke pravaktaa doctor dalajit singh cheema ne kaha ki chunaav ke dauraan deron main jane kii ravaayat he kyonki matadaata gali mohalle se lekar deraa, mandir gurudwara kahin bhi milte hai
 Not all camps are wrong
 udhar, bhaajapa netaa vineet joshi ne kaha ki punjab guruon kii dharti he or kisi bhi shubh kaam ke liye guruon kaa aashirwad lenaa shubh mana jaataa he
 On the other hand, some devotees associated with the dera are saddened by the politicization of the deras
 deraa sachcha sauda ke kuch shraddhaluon ne dharm kii aad main ho rahi raajnneeti ko rokane ke liye chunaav ayog kaa darwaja khatkhataya he
 In the complaint given to the Election Commission, it has been said that after 1995, Dera Sacha Sauda is forgetting its religious motive and playing political game
 vah na keval rajanetaaon balki apane bhole-bhaale shraddhaluon ko bhi shikaar bana rahaa hai taaki vah kanoon kii aankh main dhul jhonk sake
 One of the complainants, Mahendra Singh Joshi, a devotee and lawyer of Dera said that the dera are exploiting the devotees for their personal interests
 deron ke prabhaav se sahi ummidavaar jahaan chunaav haar jate hai, vahiin galat pravriti ke log chunaav jeet jate hai
 The complainants have appealed to the Election Commission to ban politicians from visiting the camp during the election as this practice is violating not only the code of conduct but also the People's Representation Act
 pichhali baar bhi chunaav ayog ko shikaayat di gai thi lekin ayog ne koi karrwai nahin kii
 And settled the complaint by saying that he had no evidence against the deras
 abaki baar shikaayat karne waalon ne saaf kiya he ki 10 dinon ke bheetar agar deron ke raajnneetikaran par roak nahin lagaai gai to vah punjab or haryana hai court kaa darwaja khatkhataayenge
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see whether the Election Commission prohibits entry of politicians into the dera or will continue to influence the dera elections as before

 Once again, politics of Jammu and Kashmir is in the news
 rajyapal satyapal malik ne buudhvaar shaam bada faisla lete hue vidhansabha bhang kar diya, jabaki unke is faisle se thik pehle mahabuuba mufti ne sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya tha
 Governor Malik resorted to section 2 of Constitution Article 53 of Jammu and Kashmir to dissolve the state assembly
 jaanate hai ki rajya ke samvidhan main anuchhed 53 kya kahata he
 Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik has passed an order dissolving the state Legislative Assembly

 com / tirffzftcs— ANI (@ani)november 21, 2018artical 53 kaa section 1 kahata he ki rajyapal ko niyamit samay par vidhansabha satr bulaanaa chahie, lekin do satron ke bich 6 maheene se zyada kaa antaraal nahin hona chahie
 On the other hand, Section 2 says that either the Governor should continue the session of the House or dissolve the Assembly
 isse pehle rajya main pidipi or bijepi kaa gathbandhan tuutane ke baad se is saal 20 june se rajya main rajyapal shashan lagu tha
 Why do you think Governor's rule is imposed in case of political parties failing to form government in all other states of the country whereas in Jammu and Kashmir, the case is slightly different and Governor's rule is imposed instead of President's rule
 jammu-kashmirake samvidhan ke anuchhed 92 ke tahat rajya main chah maheene ke liye rajyapal shashan lagu kiya jaataa he, haalanki isaki manjuuri desh ke raashtrapati se leni hoti he
 Mehbooba Mufti, the head of the opposition party angrypeople's Democratic Party (PDP), had submitted a claim to the Governor Malik on Wednesday evening to form the government
 pidipi kii aguwai main buudhvaar ko kuch partiyon ne sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa bheja to rajyapal satyapal malik ne kuch hi minuton baad rajya kii vidhansabha hi bhang kar di
 Many parties are criticizing this decision of the Governor
 mahabuuba mufti ne pidipi ke 29, ensi ke 15 or congress ke 12 vidhayakon ko milakar 56 vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil hone kaa daawa karte hue sarkaar banane kii peshkash kii thi
 Former Chief Minister of the state Mehbooba Muftine said that this whole incident is disappointing
 mufti ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki rajyapal ko pehle sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaon par gaur karnaa chahie tha
 The ideal situation would have been to invite the largest party to form the government
 'bijepi kaa taanaashaahee ravaiya'duusari ore, congress ke netaa gulam nabi aaazaad kaa is ghatnakram par kahana he ki bijepi nahin chaahati ki uske alaava koi or sarkaar banaae
 Now elections should be held in the state in three to four months, because we do not want the governor's rule to remain there
 bijepi kaa taanaashaahee ravaiya ek baar phir se sabake saamne aa gaya he
 National Conference (NC) President Omar Abdullah wrote in a tweet, 'the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference had been demanding dissolution of the assembly for five consecutive months
 ise sanyog nahin maan sakate ki idhar mahabuuba mufti sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne ja rahi thim or udhar rajyapal ne vidhansabha bhang kar di
 However, Bharatiya Janata Party state president Ravindra Raina supported the decision and said that BJP welcomes the move taken by the governor
 ek baar phir se neshnal conference, congress or pidipi jammu-kashmir main sajeesh rach rahi thi jo jammu or ladakh ke liye anyaay hota
 Will they ally before the elections? videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa gopal baagle ne kaha, 'jahaan tak bricks enese kii baithak ko lekar rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ke china daure kii baat he, main pushti kar saktaa hum ki vah jaaenge
 The tour will take place on 27 and 28 July '
 yah puche jane par ki kya bricks (brazil, rus, bharat, china or dakshin africa) ke enese kii baithak ke itar dobhaal kii kisi chini netaa yaa seemaa vaarta ke vishesh pratinidhi ke saath baithak hogi, baagle ne koi sidhaa jawaab nahin diya
 He said, 'we will let you know when there is progress'
 tippaniyan (from input language) (input bhashaa se) (from input language) kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ke danga bhadakaane ke aropiyon se jail main mulaakaat ko bijepi galat nahin maan rahi he
 She is asking the opposite
 maamle ko lekar bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa sambit paatra ne sawaal kiya ki chaara ghotaale main sajayaftaa lalu prasad yadav ko gale lagane waalon ko is mulaakaat par sawaal uthaane kaa kya haq hai?argedy par nishaanaa sadhate hue paatra ne kaha ki lalu jab jail main the, to unase milane jane waalon se kyon nahin sawaal poocha gaya? behad sangeen maamalon main sajayaftaa shahabuddin se milane jab bihar sarkaar ke mantri ja rahe the, to unase sawaal kyon nahin poocha gaya? shahabuddin jab jail se chhootakar baahar aayaa, to uske swaagat main juluus nikaala gaya, usamen kai netaa shaamil the
 Why was the question not raised then? Let us know that BJP President Amit Shah is coming to Patna on 12 July
 unke daure se pehle maahaul banane ke liye bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa sambit paatra somvaar ko patna main the
 Talking to the media here, Patra made it clear that the party is standing with Giriraj Singh
 jo koi giriraaj singh par sawaal uthaa rahaa he, wo aainaa dekh le
 BJP says that Union Minister Giriraj Singh has not committed any crime by meeting his supporters in Nawada Jail
 jab maamle main unase pratikriya maang gai, to sambit paatra ne giriraaj singh kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki loktantr main koun kisase miltaa he, is par bhala kya pratikriya di ja sakati he?maaloom ho ki navada main danga ke aarope main jail bheje gaye bajrang dal or vishwa hindu parishad ke netaaon se giriraaj singh ne jail jaakar mulaakaat kii thi
 Giriraj Singh had alleged that the administration was taking one-sided action
 is parabihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaarane kaha ki agar kisi ko karrwai ko lekar aitraaj he, to wo court ja saktaa he, lekin police kii karrwai par ungali nahin uthaai ja sakati he
 He also objected to the Union minister meeting the accused in jail

 On May 26, the completion of one year of the Narendra Modi government, BJP national president Amit Shah was talking to the media about the achievements
 ek ghante chali is press conference kaa aakhri sawaal tha- aapako bhi adhyaksh bane kareeb ek saal ho gaye, par aapaki team adhuri he
 "the officials are complete, we have more than we need," was Shah's reply
 ” lekin sawaal he ki teen hafte baad hi shah ne rikt padon ko bharte hue 10 padaadhikariyon kii nai suchi kyon jari kii? shah ke karibiyon kii maane to shah kii kaaryastylee kaa yahi andaaj he
 They never work under speculation or pressure and if they ever have to, they delay it, so that they do not appear under pressure
 unki pahchaan mukhar kadam uthaane waalon main se he jo andruni siyasat ko khud ke nirnyon par haaavee nahin hone dete
 Actually, Shah has done a dual strategy by restructuring the team
 bijepi main lagaataar ye atakalein lag rahi thim ki bihar vidhansabha chunaav main sambhavit vipareet nattejey shah kii adhyaksh pad par dobaaraa tajposhi main baadhak ban sakate hai
 So they are not expanding their team and are running from temporary team only
 lekin shah ke ek kareebi netaa kaa kahana he, “ve jis raftaar se kaam kar rahe hai or party ke vistaar ke liye nae mahatvakankshi kaam haath main le rahe hai, usamen kahin yah ashanka nahin he ki unhen adhyaksh pad kaa doosraa kaarykaal nahin milegaa
 He will continue in the post of president with full power
 ” yahi aatmavishvaas shah ne apni adhuri team ko puraa karte hue bhi jatalane kii koshish kii he
 The policy of restructuring the seniors The way Amit Shah has given place to unknown faces in the team restructuring has also given a clear message to the senior leaders that they will do well in the organization
 sutron ke mutabik, grih mantri rajnath singh nahin chaahate the ki unke rishtedaar arun singh ko mahasachiv banaaya jaae
 But despite his reluctance, Shah made Arun Singh the general secretary
 sutron kaa kahana he ki rajnath do vajahon se arun singh kii niyukti nahin chaahate the
 The first & he will be accused of dynasticism and the second & anti-party faction can present a new Rajput leadership from within the family of Rajnath as a challenge against him in future
 khud rajnath ne teen baar party adhyaksh rahete hue arun singh ko rishtedaar hone kii vajah se sanghathan main koi badi jimmedaari nahin di
 Similarly, Om Prakash Mathur was also not in favor of joining the team as vice-president
 maathur adhyaksh pad ke liye shah ke saath daud main the or ve bhi pradhanmantri modi ke karibiyon main maane jate hai
 There was no representation in the national team from Rajasthan so Mathur has been included
 lekin sutron kaa kahana he ki maathur apni varishthata ke mutabik team main jagah chaahate the or iske liye formula diya gaya tha ki maathur ko mahasachiv banaakar party kii sarvocch niti nirdharak sanstha sansadeey board main bhi shaamil kiya jaae taaki unke kad ke lihaaj se munasib lage
 The parliamentary board usually consists of a general secretary who works as the secretary of the board
 kendriya swasthya mantri je
 P
 nadda jab shah kii team main mahasachiv the to unke paas bhi yahi jimmedaari thi
 Shah has not made any changes in the responsibilities of the parliamentary board
 daleel di ja rahi he ki maathur pehle bhi mahasachiv rah chuke hai or unka naam adhyaksh pad ke liye chalaa tha isliye unhen upaadhyaksh banaaya gaya he
 But the fact is that Nadda's name also rose for the post of president, but he was the general secretary in Team Shah before being made a minister
 unka kad sansadeey board main sachiv banaakar badhaayaa gaya tha
 Most of the opposition voices were raised to make Kailash Vijayvargiya, the minister in the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government of Madhya Pradesh, as general secretary
 haalanki unhen mahasachiv banaae jane kii charchaa haryana vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii jeet ke baad hi hone lagi thi kyonki us chunaav main unhone bataur prabharee ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Therefore, due to the increasing stature of Vijayvargiya, there was a stir in the Madhya Pradesh BJP
 sutron ke mutabik mukhyamantri chouhan vijayawargeey ko sarkaar main mantri banaae rakhane kii baat kahkar unhen mahasachiv banane se rokna chaah rahe the to duusari taraf loksabhaa spikar or indore se loksabhaa saansad sumitra mahajan, kendriya ispaat mantri or purv pradesh adhyaksh narendra singh tomars, rajya ke purv prabharee or kendriya rasayan or urvarak mantri anant kumaar, kendriya saamaajik nyaay or aadhikarita mantri thavarchand gahalot sareekhe netaa unke paksh main nahin the
 But Union Road, Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari was in his favor
 sutron ke mutabik, is masale par virodh kii aawaaj sangh ke sarkarywah bhaiyyaji joshi tak pahunchi or unhen is maamle main dakhal dena padaa
 Prior to the final decision, Shah held a meeting with Chief Minister Chauhan in Delhi in the presence of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and pronounced his decision
 aakhirkaar shah kii ranneeti ke mutabik kailash vijayawargeey mahasachiv banaae gaye
 Young Leadership on Unknown: There is no doubt that Shah is new in the politics of Delhi
 unki santhnik kshamta mukhya rup se gujarat main hi pradhanmantri narendra modi kii chhatrachhaaya main aage badi he
 But at the central level, the modi-shah duo did not have their own faction
 isliye shah ne team punargathan main unheen chehron ko zyada tarjeeh di jo party main kisi bade netaa ke gut vishesh se sambandh nahin rakhte taaki bhavishya main jarurat padane par ye netaa bijepi ke “nae yug” ke saath khadey dikhen
 Shyam Jaju, who was made vice-president from the national secretary in Shah's team, says, "in the new list of 10 names released for the team, there is no nationally recognizable face other than Om Mathur and me
 adhyaksh ne baaki sabhi nae chehron ko team main tarjeeh dekar nai peedi kaa netritv ubhaarne kii koshish kii he kyonki inamen zyaadaatar yuva hai
 Shah had in mind seniority with regional balance at the time of the formation of his first team and there were not many surprising names at that time
 lekin shah ne us team main nae or yuva chehron ko badi jimmedaari dekar apni kaaryastylee kaa sandesh de diya tha
 In the BJP, secretaries are usually responsible for assistants along with the general secretaries, but Shah handed over the charge of the states to the secretaries independently
 shyaam jaju haalanki varishthata kram main aage the, phir bhi ve shah kii team main isse pehle sachiv ban paae the
 But of late, Jaju has been made the party's vice-president
 ve bhi sachiv rahete hue uttarakhand ke prabharee the
 Similarly, Shrikant Sharma, who was made secretary for the first time in Shah's team, was made in charge of Himachal Pradesh where Shanta Kumar, Prem Kumar Dhumal, J

 Nadda is a senior leader
 pashchim bengal kii jimmedaari sachiv siddharth nath singh ko to dow
 Anil Jain was assigned the responsibility of Haryana, Arun Singh to Odisha
 jain or arun singh ab padonnat hokar mahasachiv ban chuke hai to jaju upaadhyaksh
 Shah's strategy is to replace the established leaders with new responsibilities by giving them a new leadership
 upaadhyakshon or mahasachivon ke alaava chaar nae sachivon kii niyukti main shah kii ranneeti khaas taur se jhalkati he
 Even before Odisha state president Suresh Pujari was given the responsibility of secretary, Shah made him a member of the special committee set up to train new workers and leaders in the bjp's Bangalore executive in April
 jabaki assam ke prabharee ke rup main kaam kar rahe uttar pradesh ke varisht netaa mahendra singh ko bhi sachiv banaaya gaya he jinka naam party halkon main upi main mukhyamantri pad kii daud main shaamil chehron main shumaar kiya jaataa he
 Mahesh Giri, MP from Delhi and Farooq Khan, a former IPS officer from Jammu and Kashmir, have quickly become a member of Team Shah
 bhale shah team main kaam ke hisaab se jaruri log hone kii daleel dekar khaali jagahon ko bharne se inkaar karte rahe hon, lekin hakeekat yah he ki padaadhikariyon kii kami kii vajah se shah kii sabase mahatvakankshi mahasampark abhiyaan kii gati par asar pad rahaa tha
 So after the team is formed, Shah has dumped all the 10 office bearers in the mass campaign and instructed them to stay
 ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he, “logon kii kami kaa asar kaam par dikhne laga tha
 With General Secretary Bhupendra Yadav busy in the Bihar elections, the task was not comfortable with just three people, so Shah has expanded the team
 ”haalanki is team punargathan ke baad bhi shah kii team main kuch pad khaali hai
 According to the bjp's constitution, 13 vice presidents, 9 general secretaries, an organization general secretary, 15 secretaries and a treasurer can be appointed
 iske alaava sanghathan mahasachiv ke saath ek se adhik sahaayak jode ja sakate hai
 But despite the reorganization, the team has three vacant posts of vice president and one general secretary
 jabaki koshadhyaksh kii niyukti na to shah ne team ke gathan ke vakt kiya or na hi punargathan main
 At present, Union Minister of State for Power Piyush Goyal is handling the responsibility of Treasurer as additional charge
 bijepi ke modi-shah yug main pravesh ke baad sthapit netaaon main kulbulaahat to he lekin isse beparwaah hokar kaam kar rahe hai
 But will these efforts of Shah help him get a second term? Political circumstances are not indicating so at the moment

 Samiran Nandi, chairman of the Department of Surgical Gastroentrology and Organ Transplantation at Sir Gangaram Hospital, said, "I cannot understand the logic behind this
" aisi dasha main jabaki marij ko dil kaa daura padaa ho, jaisaa ki mujhe media se jaankaree mili he, use dilli se singapore le janaa asaamaanya baat he

 After that, his bowel transplant should have been done
 aisi sthiti main aant pratyaropan kii baat samaj main nahin aati

 (agenciyon ke input ke saath) Children have also increased after the school bus decision
 ab bacchon kii sankhya 50 se 90 ho gai he
 Not only this, after driving, Rajaram also teaches mathematics and science
 bataa den, skool dur hone kii vajah se or kharaab road ke kaaran kuch bacchon ne to skool tak aana band kar diya tha
 Children had to walk 5 to 6 kilometers daily
 din-ba-din bachche kam hote ja rahe the
 If this was less then the school may have to be closed
 aise main unhone bas chalaane kaa sochaa
 Rajaram is the most preferred teacher of school children
 wo ganit, vigyaan ke saath-saath piti teacher bhi hai
 Even when he takes leave from school, he takes care of whether the children are reaching school time
 saat saal pehle aparaadh par kaabo paane ke liye nitish kumaar kii sarkaar ne jab aparaadhiyon par lagaam kasni shuru kii thi tab zyaadaatar apradhi salaakhon ke peeche chale gaye the
 Those who survived the action had taken a different route due to the strictness of the government
 tab se baahubal ke boote rajnatik pahchaan kaayam karne vaale log aise maukey kii taak main the ki unhen sarkari oxigen mili or ve phir se apane haath khol saken
 JD (U) provided a similar opportunity to these people on 4 November through Adhikar Rally
 yun to is raily ko safal banane main jedy (you) ke bade netaaon kii bhoomika ahm rahi, lekin damdaar upasthiti dikhaane ko lekar dabangon main kuch zyada hi hode much gai
 Anant Kumar Singh, who was nicknamed 'chhoti Sarkar' during the rally, was unique in style, wearing a hat and black glasses
 saath main samarthakon kaa bada hujum, jo vidhayak or mukhyamantri kaa binar liye the
 Anant Singh, running amidst strong security arrangements, reached the stage from the crowd instead of the VIP gallery
 aisa isliye ki jab party kii ore se unhen mauka mila hi he to unki kshamta kaa ehsaas bade netaa or maujuud logon ko bhi ho
 He crossed the barricades heralded for the media, causing unintended public attention
 phir unhone kursi par khadey hokar logon kaa abhivadan kiya
 Dabangg mlas Manoranjan Singh, Sunil Pandey and his brother Hulas Pandey also made their presence felt with full vigor
 vidhayak amrendra pandeya ke samarthakon ne unhen kandhe par uthaakar unki takat kaa ehsaas karaayaa
 Already a fortnight in Patna, the posters of the rally had seen the dominance of the domineering people, who had put up big posters and hoardings with the Chief Minister
 jinase kai mahapurushon kii pratimaayein bhi bannron se dhak gai thim
 Banners and posters were removed from many such places on the instructions of the Chief Minister some three days before the rally, when the protesters started creating a hymn
 lekin raily main dabangon kii is karypranali se virodhiyon ko acha mauka mil gaya
 RJD Principal General Secretary MP Ramkripal Yadav said, "the cutout of Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan, Jananayak Karpoori Thakur and Ram Manohar Lohia was not visible in Gandhi Maidan
 ’’adhikaar raily kii taiyaari ke samay se hi dabangon ke pradarshan kii prishthbhumi taiyaar ho rahi thi jiskaa asal pradarshan 4 november ko dekhne ko mila
 It is alleged that people got their first demonstration of domination during the Chief Minister's visit to the Chief Minister in Khagadiya on 27 September, when JD (U) MLA Poonam Devi Yadav's Bahubali husband Ranveer Yadav snatched the bodyguard's carbine and pointed it at the protesters
 
 ranvir samuhik narsanhaar ke ek maamle main sajayaftaa hai
 Oddly enough, action was taken against the protesters but Ranveer stayed out of this JD
 unke bachaav main kaha gaya ki police kii carbine bheed main gir gai thi, jise unhone uthaa liya tha
 But the extent was reached when the stage was told that it was due to Ranveer Yadav that the Chief Minister could reach the stage
 yahi nahin, adhikaar yatra ke dauraan 8 aktubar ko karodon ru
 The incident of Chief Minister's stay at Nawada residence of Govindpur MLA Kaushal Yadav, accused of mining scam, has given a boost to the talk of the overbearing in the rally
 chah saal pehle isi sarkaar ne kaushal yadav or emelsi salmaan rageeb ke khilaaf do karod ru
 Had taken action in the mining scam, the case is pending in court
 raily ke naam par mujffarpur shahid khudiram bose kendriya kaara main band purv vidhayak vijay kumaar shukla urf munna shukla ke rangadari maangane kii ghatana ne sarkaar kii vyavastha par sawaal khadey kar die
 RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav questioned, "our government was accused of giving protection to criminals, now people should see how the criminals are unbridled in the present government
" ’’ unhone kaha ki na sirf jedy (you) netaa balki police or prashasnic mahakama bhi jabaran ugaahi main shaamil hai
 People are unable to raise their voice due to their fear
 peshi ke liye court pahunche shukla ne raily main pahunchane kaa parchaa baantkar rahi-sahi kasar bhi puri kar di
 Many policemen were suspended in this connection
 par raily ke dauraan dabangon kii is kaaryastylee ne sarkaar kii us saakh par sawaal khadaa kar diya, jise sthapit karne main use badi mushkil se safalataa mili thi
 The chief minister wanted a replay of the historic JP rally held in 1974, 38 years old, on the question of special state status to Bihar
 isiilie logon ko aamantrit karne ke liye unhone khud 30 jilon kaa daura kiya
 But it seems that the government has become soft-hearted towards those people who were very strict about them strictly
 dabangon kii is karypranali se sarkaar ko kaaphi aalochana jhelni padi or raily kaa mul vishay bhi prabhavit hua, jiske liye sarkaar maheenon se prayasarat thi
 The question arises that when such people start coming into effective role then what will be the difference between the good governance of the present government and the alleged 'jungle State' of the previous government! a government that suffers from good governance should think about it

 dilli sarkaar ne ab tak yahaan nunatam mazdooree ko lagu nahin kiya he
 a petition has been filed against this in the Delhi High Court
 is yachika par court ne dilli sarkaar ko notice bheja he
 The petition said that Sarkara had brought a notification on March 3 this year regarding the minimum wage of Rs 13,350 in Delhi
 lekin dilli sarkaar ne ab tak ise lagu nahin kiya he
 Surprisingly, after the notification, instructions have been given not to take any action against those who give upside down employment
 4 maheene pehle hi aa gaya sarkaar kaa notificationayachika me kaha gaya he ki dilli sarkaar agar ise lagu karti he to kareeb 60 lakh logo ko iskaa phayda milegaa
 The petitioner said that due to the bad intentions of the government, the government has no interest in getting the fixed amount of money from the factory to the millions of workers working in people's homes
 jokanunan tankhwabprashikshit workars ko milani chahie, usase aadhi tankhwaah workars ko mil rahi he
 At the same time, the government notification has come 4 months ago
 ste ko hataakar notificeshan ko lagu karaayaa jaenunatam mazdooree kam se kam 13,350 rakhi gayi he
 But right now men are getting salary of 6 thousand and women only 5 thousand
 yani jo kanuunan milanaa chahie uskaa aadha paisa naukari dene vaale log apni jeb me daal rahe he
 It has been said in the petition that the stay should be implemented by removing the stay
 saath hi dilli sarkaar ke khilaaf court khud ection lene kii baat bhi yachika main likhi gai he
 Another important question has been raised in the petition that in 1980 there were 5 thousand staff in the government department
 inako ye sunishit karnaa tha ki workars ko nunatam mazdooree mili
 But now the staff has also reduced to only 125 Enforcement Staff
 jabaki ab industry dilli main 10 guna zyada badi ho gayi he
 No employer has been challaned for non-payment of minimum wages
 lihaaja 60 lakh logon ke saath vetan ko lekar ye sarkaar kaa dhokhaa he
 The Home Ministry had issued an advisory expressing deep concern over the ongoing violence in West Bengal
 isamen mamata sarkaar ko nagarikon main vishwaas banaae rakhane main vifal bataaya tha
 In response to the advisory, the Chief Secretary of West Bengal has written a letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs
 isamen unhone daawa kiya he ki rajya main halaat niyantran main hai
 The Chief Secretary of West Bengal Malay Kumar wrote in the letter - after the election there was violence by some anti-social elements
 is prakaar ke maamalon ko rokane ke liye adhikariyon dwaara bina kisi deree ke karrwai kii gai
 Malay Kumar further wrote - The situation in the state is under control and on the basis of such incidents, law and order in the state cannot be considered as a failure

 TMC said that the Home Ministry has issued advisory on the law and order of West Bengal without knowing the ground reality
 is maamle main rajya sarkaar se bhi koi report nahin lee gai he
 The TMC reacted sternly that BJP goons under the guise of a code of conduct led to violence in the state and now BJP and Home Ministry are also being led by the same person
 bijepi jo bhi chaahati he grih mantralay aankh mundakar use maan rahaa he
 The ruling TMC further said - as a national party we want to ask why such advisory was not issued against the UP government where 25 people of Yadav community were brutally murdered
 grih mantralay kii adwijuri-grih mantralay ne ravivaar ko jari hinsa se nipatane ke liye rajya sarkaar ko adwijuri jari kii thi
 The advisory stated that the ongoing violence without restraint in the state for the past few weeks was a failure of the government machinery to maintain law and order and the confidence of ordinary citizens towards it
 yah sunishchit karne ke liye dridhtaa se salaah di jaati he ki kanoon-vyavastha or shanti banaae rakhane ke liye sabhi aavashyak upaay kiye jaaen
 The Ministry had advised the responsible officials to take strict action while discharging their duties
 pashchim bengal sarkaar kaa grih mantralay ko patratiemasi kaa grih mantralay ko patr Reshma Patel said, 'our movement was about reservation under OBC quota
 yah bhaajapa ko ukhadkar uski jagah congress ko satta main laane ke liye nahin tha
 Where BJP has always supported the community and has accepted most of our demands
 congress sirf patelon ko vot bank ke taur par istemaal karne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 We do not want to be part of such a malicious plot

 magar rishta adhuraa chhot jane ke baad bhi araju or naveen milte rahe
 Even Naveen's marriage was decided elsewhere

 In the car, just two days before the murder of Arju, he murders the girl with whom he was getting married
 phir usee araju kii laash apane kamare main laakar chupa detaa he
 On the evening of February 2, Naveen reached Arju's college in his car and took him with him to a village near Indira Gandhi International Airport
 vahaan usne car main hi araju ke dopatte se galaa ghont kar uski hatya kar di
 Lashanveen, hiding in the house, did not get a chance to hide Arju's body

 Making a bundle of corpses, he took her directly to his bedroom
