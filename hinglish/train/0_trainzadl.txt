 choudhary pushpendra singhganna kisaanon ko jis baat kii ashanka thi yogi sarkaar ne chini udyog lobby ke dabaav main vahi kiya
 Like last year, the government has not increased the cane price this year, whereas the situation of sugar industry has changed completely this year at the country and internationally
 sarkaar ke is nirnay se ganna kisaanon main rosh ke saath maayusi chaa gai he
 The enthusiasm with which sugarcane farmers supported and formed the BJP government in 2017, now they feel cheated
 pichley do saalon se atyadhik chini utpaadan or vishaal chini-bhandar se pareshaan chini udyog kii sthiti is saal badal gai he
 This year, due to low sugar production and high demand in the international market, the sugar industry will get complete relief, but how will the situation of sugarcane farmers improve by not increasing the sugarcane rate? Initial stock of sugar in the country in 2018-19 (opening stock) 104 Lakh tonnes, production 332 lakh tonnes, domestic consumption 255 million tonnes and exports 38 lakh tonnes
 is prakaar vartmaan chini varsh 2019-20 main chini kaa praarambhik bhandar 143 lakh ton he
 So sugar is already stored in our warehouses for about seven months of consumption
 kuch maheene pehle tak yah bahut hi chintajanak sthiti thi jisko dekhte hue sarkaar ne chini milon ko chini kii jagah ethnaul banane ke liye kai protsaahan die the
 But first the drought and subsequent excessive unseasonal rains caused a lot of damage to the sugarcane crop in the country
 isse maharashtra main chini kaa utpaadan pichley saal ke 107 lakh ton se ghatakar 55 lakh ton or karnataka main 44 lakh ton se ghatakar 33 lakh ton rahane kii sambhaavna he
 According to ISMA (indian Sugar Mills Association), the production of sugar in the country this year is expected to fall by 21 percent to about 260 lakh tonnes, which will be sufficient for domestic market consumption only
 chaalu ganna varsh 2019-20 ke pehle do maheenon oktober-november main desh main chini kaa utpaadan pichley saal ke lagbhag 41 lakh ton ke mukaable aadhe se zyada ghatakar lagbhag 19 lakh ton par aa gaya he
 In 2019-20, world sugar production is expected to be 1,756 lakh tonnes and demand is 1,876 lakh tonnes
 yani utpaadan maang se 120 lakh ton kam hone kaa anumaan he
 Therefore, there will be good demand for sugar in the international market this year, which we can supply
 antarrashtriya bazaar main chini utpaadan main sambhavit kami se hamaare pahaad se chini-bhandar achaanak acchhee khabar main badal gaye hai
 The sugar industry of Uttar Pradesh will be the biggest beneficiary in this situation because like last year, Uttar Pradesh will remain the first place in sugar production this year, where 120 lakh tonne sugar production is estimated
 pichley varsh uttar pradesh ke kisaanon ne lagbhag 33,000 karod rupee mulya ke ganne kii aapurti chini milon main kii thi
 But out of this, the cane payment of more than about 3000 crore rupees is still outstanding from the farmers
 pichley do saalon se atyadhik chini utpaadan or bhare hue bhandaron kaa hawala dekar ek taraf chini mil kisaanon kaa bhugtan taalati rahi hai, to duusari taraf sarkaar ne bhi ganne ke daam nahin badhaaye
 In July, the central government had announced the FRP (fair and remunerative price) of sugarcane for the year 2019-20 at Rs 275 per quintal for a base recovery of 10 percent
 varsh 2018-19 main bhi kendra sarkaar kaa etharapy itnaa hi tha parantu aadhaar recovery dar 9
 Was 5 percent
 is varsh aadhaar recovery dar badhaane or mahangaai dar ke prabhaav se ganne kaa vaastavik mulya ghat gaya he
 The same situation has happened in Uttar Pradesh where SAP (state advisory price) has been at the level of Rs 315-325 per quintal for the last two years
 parantu ab ganna or chini donon ke utpaadan kii sthiti desh or antarrashtriya bazaar main badal gai he jiske kaaran ganna mulya badhaayaa janaa chahie tha
 Recently, the Uttar Pradesh government had consulted all stakeholders for the 2019-20 sugarcane pricing
 is baithak main uttar pradesh chini mills association ne phir ek baar apni kharaab aarthik sthiti, chini ke atyadhik utpaadan or bhandar kaa dar dikhaakar is saal bhi ganne kaa rate naa badhaane kii maang rakhi thi
 Farmers say that sugarcane rates have not been increased for two years while the cost has gone up
 ganne kii utpaadan laagat lagbhag 300 rupee prati quintal aa rahi he
 Even if you forget the promise of one and a half times the cost of the government, in the changed situation, at least Rs 400 per quintal should have been received
 yadi pichley do saalon main 10 pratishat kii maamuli dar se vruddhi bhi kii jaati to bhi is dar se is varsh 400 rupee prati quintal kaa bhav apane aap ho jaataa
 The reality is that sugar mills also earn well from sugar by-products such as molasses, bagasse, bagasse, prasamad etc
 iske alaava sah-utpaadon se ethnaul, baio-fertiliser, plaiwood, bijli va anya utpaada banaakar bhi bechati hai
 According to the Sugarcane (control) Order, sugar mills should pay sugarcane within 14 days
 bhugtan main vilamb hone par 15 pratishat prati varsh kii dar se byaaj bhi dey hota he
 But sugar mills do not pay sugarcane year after year and use this capital of farmers without paying interest
 is tarah milen bainkon ke byaaj kii bachat bhi karti hai
 In the last two years, the government has given many incentive packages to the sugar mills, yet the mills did not pay the sugarcane on time
 har saal hone vaali ganna bhugatna or kisaanon ko acha mulya naa milane kii samasya se nipatane ke liye hamen chini udyog ke vishay main ek alag niti banane par bhi vichaar karnaa hoga
 75 percent of the sugar in the country is used by commercial establishments including manufacturers of chocolate, beverages, chyawanprash, juice, sweets, ice-creams, biscuits, etc
 in peya-khaadya padaarthon main 60 pratishat tak chini hoti he jise atyadhik manhage daamon par upabhoktaaon ko bechaa jaataa he
 Just as the rate of commercially used gas cylinders is higher than the domestic used cylinders, similarly the rate of commercially used sugar is set higher than the domestic, then the problem of both sugar mills and sugarcane farmers can be solved
 duusare, brazil kii tarah hamen bhi ganne kaa prayog bazaar kii maang ke anusaar chini, ethnaul yaa anya utpaadon ko banane main niyantrit rup se karnaa chahie
 One can avoid excessive sugar production and secondly, the use of ethanol in petrol can save some of the foreign exchange spent on import of petroleum products
 isse vaayu pradooshan bhi kuch kam hoga
 Both these steps are in the interest of the country, government, farmers and sugar industry
 adhik utpaadan ko dekhte hue pichley do saalon se ganne ke daam nahin badhaayaa gaya
 Real prices have come down due to the effect of inflation
 badali paristhitiyon main kam chini utpaadan or acchhee antarrashtriya maang ko dekhte hue sarkaar ko laabhakaari ganna mulya dilaanaa sunishchit karnaa chahie tha parantu is sthiti kaa sara laabh ab chini milen hi uthaaengi or kisaanon ke haath maayusi ke alaava kuch nahin lagegaa
 If the government still takes some of the above steps, then by giving a separate bonus, sugarcane farmers can be saved
 ganna mulya bahut ho samvedansheel raajnneetik mudda he jisase karodon logon kii jeevika judi hui he
 If the government does not take initiative with immediate effect, it may have to pay a huge political price
 (lekhak kisaan shakti sangh ke adhyaksh hai or yahaan vyakt vichaar unke apane hai
 This does not require India Today's consent) *** maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta tista sitalwar ko supreme court se 19 farvari tak giraftaari se raahat mil gai he
 Let us understand what is the whole matter and why there is a dispute on the action against Teesta
 tista sitalwad 2002 se hi gujarat main danga peediton kii madad main juty hai
 His NGO has fought a legal battle on behalf of the victims in many cases and played an important role in punishing many of the accused and more, because of which Narendra Modi had to appear before the Special Investigation Team (SIT)
 Teesta was also behind
 gulburg socity main maare gaye purv saansad ehsaan jaafaree kii patni zakiya jaafaree ne supreme court main aarope lagaae the ki narendra modi dangon ke liye zimmedaar hai
 SIT also questioned Narendra Modi to investigate the same
 pehali baar unhen kisi jaanch ayog ke saamne pesh hona padaa tha
 The SIT gave Modi a clean chit after questioning him
 ab is clinit ko zakiya hoicourt main chunauti de rahi hai
 Now come to the current issue
 maamla he gulburg socity main rit museum banane kaa
 About 20 houses of the Gulberg Society currently remain in ruins
 sirf ek ghar main kasim mansuri ko chhodkar or baaki ghar ab bhi jaale, barbaad hue pade hai
 Teesta had announced that this museum will be built here in memory of those killed in the riots
 iske liye yahaan jinke ghar hai, unhen bazaar keemat par use kharidne kii baat kahi thi
 But then due to the huge increase in the price of the land in the next 3-4 years, this plan fell in cold storage
 is dauraan gulburg socity ke kuch danga peediton ne tista par aarope lagaaya ki rit museum banane ke liye unhone ek badi rakam kaa chanda jamaa kiya tha, jisamen se kuch paisa unhone apane nijee phaayde ke liye kharch kar die
 One such application was also submitted to the Crime Branch
 krime branch ne bhi is maamle main exiaar darj kar jaanch shuru kar di
 Crime Branch said that Teesta collected about Rs 10 crore and spent Rs 3-4 crore for his personal benefit
 tista se is maamle main poochtacha ho chuki he
 The crime branch wants to arrest them
 tista iske khilaaf agrim zamaanat ke liye gujarat hoicourt gai thi, jahaan se unki yachika kaarij ho gai
 a few minutes later, the crime branch arrived at his house in Mumbai, 400 km from Ahmedabad
 vahaan tista nahin milin or kuch ghante baad unhen apane vakeelon ke zariye supreme court se giraftaari par roak mil gai
 Meanwhile, there have been two camps in Gulberg Society
 ek bada khemaa ab bhi kah rahaa he kii tista ne unke liye bahut kiya he or unhone kisi tarah kaa gaban nahin kiya he
 But the complainants are saying that in order to get justice, Teesta must be arrested
 tista ke vakeelon ne supreme court main kaha ki maamla jitna bada bataaya ja rahaa he, utana bada he nahin
 He claims that the matter is not of crores, but only of four lakhs and is only paying the price of fighting the fight for justice against the Modi government
 lekin in aarope-pratyarope ke bich nigahen supreme court par he
 There evidence is more important than allegations
 donon hi pakshon ko apane aarope sabit karne ke liye saboot pesh karne honge
 Actor Shah Rukh Khan is not at all interested in the traditional roles given to Indian actors in Hollywood films
 vah kehete hai ki hollywood filmon main apane bhartiya rang-rup, angreji bolne ke andaaj or abhinay style se itar bhoomika paanaa bada kathin kaam he
 Shahrukh has been in the Hindi cinema world for 20 years and has worked in more than 80 films till now
 unhen bollywood kaa superstar kaha jaataa he, lekin antarrashtriya filmon main upasthiti darj karana shahrukh ke liye ab bhi baaki he
 Shah Rukh is quite popular in many countries outside India as well

 But Bollywood's 'king Khan' feels that he does not have the specialty of working in Hollywood films
 tippaniyan Asked why he thinks so, Shah Rukh said, "I am not saying this based on the number of fans

 lekin bollywood ke 'king khan' ko lagata he ki hollywood filmon main kaam karne kii khaasiyat unamem nahin he

 President sharmile log beshak aapse aankh milakar baat karne main jhijakte hon lekin ve dusron ke chehron ke haav bhav ko aasaani se samaj sakate hai
 Researchers found that shy college-age people recognize the feelings of sadness and fear on the faces of others more easily than those who are not shy
 is adhyayan kii mukhya shodhakarta grevs o hewar is adhyayan ke parinaamon ko hairaan karne vaala bataati hai
 Because the previous study found that shy people do not make true sense of facial expressions of other people
 khabaron ke anusaar, grevs bataati hai ki pichhlaa adhyayan bacchon par kiya gaya tha
 Their ability to understand the gestures of the faces of others can improve with age
 is nae adhyayan main logon ke sharmilepan kaa ek sakaaratmak pahalu saamne nikalakar aayaa he
 For this research, Graves studied the information found in 241 college students through an online survey
 adhyayan main shaamil vidhyaarthiyon kii umr ausatan 19 saal thi
 These students were asked to show 110 pictures and which picture is showing which emotion? To find out the level of shyness of these students, they were asked whether they felt upset with unknown people
 Or do they find it difficult to ask for information from anyone? Or do they find it inconvenient to go to parties? This study found that these students recognized facial expressions up to 81 percent of the pictures shown
 jin logon main sharmilapan zyada tha ve anya logon kii tulana main dukh or dar ke bhaavon ko zyada sahi tareeke se pahchaan paae the
 When these people were asked how they felt during the study, most of the shy people were in a bad mood
 is par grevs kahati hai ki jab insaan kaa mood kharaab hota he to vah dusron main kharaab paksh hi dekhtaa he
 It is possible that they have easily identified the bad facial expressions of the faces
 supreme court kaa kendriya satarkta ayukta kenyukti ko radd karne kaa faislamanmohan singh sarkaar ke liye raajnneetik drushtikon se baari pareshaani paidaa karne vaala he
 The apex court found that the appointment of PJ Thomas to the post of CVC was done incorrectly
 court ne chunki unki niyukti ko amaanya kar diya he, isliye absivisi ke istifeka koi matlab nahin rah jaataa he
 On the one hand, the Court found that Thomas may be personally honest, but his appointment was not defective institutionally
 is vajah se ki kerala ke pamolin oil ghotaale main unke khilaaf chargeshit daakhil ho chukaa tha
 They a
 raja ke kaarykaal main telecom sachiv bhi rah chuke hai, jo 2ji aabantan ghotaale ke maamle main giraftaar ho chuke hai
 Also, the Supreme Court has given guidelines regarding the appointment of CVC in future
 ab se ucchadhikaar praapt panel, jisamen pradhanmantri, grahamantri or netaa vipaksh shaamil hai, iskaa koi bhi sadsy agar sivisi kii niyukti se asahmati jataata he, to asahmati ke kaaran ko darj karnaa jaruri hoga or sarkaar ko is par jawaab bhi dena hoga
 This will ensure judicial review of the entire process
 saath hi court ke nirdesh se yah bhi tay ho gaya he ki ab is tarah kii niyukti amrai se hi ho sakegi
 Sushma Swaraj, the current Leader of Opposition, had disagreed over the appointment of PJ Thomas, but the reason for this could not be reported in a very brief meeting
 court ke taaja faisle se sivisi kii niyukti main paardarshita or javabdehi tay ho sakegi
 Right now, even though this decision has been an embarrassment for the government, the future will have good results

 At the same time, the train arrived and all the people who were on the track came out trampling them
 kai log train se bachane ke liye idhar-udhar bhaage jisase ve chotil ho gaye
 Many people got hurt by stones
 maine dekha ki mujhe bleeding ho rahi thi or chaaron tarah laashen hi laashen thim
 Amritsar Rail Accident: DRM told, why did not the driver stop the train after the accident: Chashmahidid: Every time the train used to be late, yesterday we came on time

 For the first time such a fast train passed
 har baar yah train let hoti thi or saat baje ke baad aati thi, lekin kal yah 6

 After the results of the Lok Sabha elections, there was continuous speculation about the next meeting of the CWC and the next president since Gandhi's offer of resignation at the CWC meeting held on 25 May
 shashi tharur or party ke kai netaa yah khulkar kah chuke hai ki yah asamanjas kii sthiti khatm honi chahie or nae adhyaksh ko lekar jald faisla hona chahie
 The names of several senior leaders, including Mallikarjun Kharge, Ashok Gehlot, Sushil Kumar Shinde, were also discussed regarding the new party president
 vahiin, party ke varisht netaa or punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne pehle party adhyaksh kii jimmedaari kisi yuva netaa ko saunpane kii baat kii or phir mahasachiv priyanka gandhi wadra ke naam kii pairvi kii
 By the way, many other Congress leaders have also advocated Priyanka's name for the post of President
 loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii karaari haar ke baad rahul gandhi ne party ke adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya tha
 Rejecting his resignation at the time, the CWC authorized him to make a radical change in the party, although Gandhi remained firm on his stand and made it clear that neither he nor any other member of the Gandhi family would take over
 apane istife kii ghoshnaa karte hue gandhi ne yah bhi kaha tha ki congress adhyaksh nahin rahete hue bhi vah party ke liye sakriy rup se kaam karte rahenge
 Many leaders had also resigned in support of him
 gandhi ke istife ke baad se agle adhyaksh ke chunaav ko lekar party main lagaataar asamanjas kii sthiti bani hui he
 There were several rounds of meetings to choose the new president, but no name was agreed

 indo-border Tibet Police (ITBP) soldiers are proud of this helpful companion
 ye madadgaar he ‘bagheraa’
 Such dogs of Doberman breed are not only taking part in the mission against Naxalites but are also playing an important role in protecting the soldiers from attack
 inhen PEDD (petrol explosive detectashan dog) bhi kaha jaataa he
 Havildar p Sambha Siva Rao is responsible for taking care of Baghera
 raav ne india today ko bataaya ki bagheraa ne kis tarah 29 july ko chhattisgarh ke rajanandgaanv jile main manpur-baseli road par naksaliyon kii ore se jameen ke neeche dabaae gaye 20 kilo IED visphotak ko dhund nikaala
 Baghera not only saved the lives of the jawans by finding explosives but also averted a possible major Naxalite attack that took place after the blast
 ateet main naksaliyon kii ore se javaanon par ghaat lagaakar hamale ke liye aise hi tareeke apanaae jate rahe hai
 The IED recovered found a spark plug used in the bike
 aisa naksaliyon kii ore se pehali baar kiya gaya he
 Spark plug ieds have previously been used by Taliban Keer trained by ISI
 naksaliyon ne apni ore se ITBP javaanon ko zyada se zyada nuksaan pahunchane kaa intjaam kiya tha
 The poly cover was plated after the IED was wrapped in five surfaces of the vacuum pack so that the K9 squad could not detect the odor of the explosive
 lekin bagheraa jaise hi visphotak vaale spot par pahunchaa, usne apane handler ko sanket dene main 5 second bhi nahin lagaae
 itbp's 27th Battalion Commandant Vishal Anand, under the command of Assistant Commandant Subay Singh, was tasked to sanitize the 14-km long critical road of K9 squad in the area on 29 July
 umas vaali garmi kebaavjood bagheraane apane kaam ko bakhubi anjaam diya

 The IPL season 10 will begin with a 'battle' between the teams to reach the final from Tuesday
 pehle mukaable main top par rahi mumbai indiens or duusare number kii team rising pune superjyant bhidengi
 The relief news for the Pune team that reached the playoffs for the first time is that they have beaten Mumbai twice in the league round
 aise main uske paas manovaigyanik badhat hogi
 Although the tension of Pune captain Steve Smith has increased in terms of team combination, Mumbai captain Rohit Sharma is relaxed about his team combination
 ek najar daalate hai donon hi tiimon kii takat or kamajoriyon parmumbai indiens 20 ank ke saath top par he, jabaki rising pune superjyant ke 14 maichon main 18 ank hai or vah duusare sthaan par he
 In Qualifier-1, both teams will clash at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai
 is match main jo team jeetegi vah sidhe final main pahunch jaaegi
 The losing team will get another chance to play against the winning team in the eliminator
 matlab top 2 timen pehla match haarane ke baad bhi final ke daud se baahar nahin hongi
 Mumbai's Taktamumbai team would like to avenge their 2-time defeat at the hands of Pune in the league stage
 use gharelu darshakon kaa samarthan bhi milegaa
 The strong side of Mumbai is that it does not matter if one or two players are out
 jaisaa ki hamane aakhri lig match main kolkata niterides ke khilaaf dekha tha
 Mumbai had tried their bench strength in that match and defeated KKR to capture the top spot
 puure sijan main mumbai indiens ke ballebaajon khaastaur se nitish rana, landal simons, kirone pollard or parthiv patel ne shandaar khel dikhaaya he, vahiin pandya bros abtak team ke liye trump card sabit hue hai
 Jasprit Bumrah has performed well in the death overs
 hardik or vah milakar pune ke ballebaajon par ankush laga sakate hai
 Mumbai's weakness For Mumbai, skipper Rohit Sharma's absence from form may prove to be a weak link
 un par captaini ke saath acchhee pari khilne kaa bhi dabaav hoga
 Rohit could not make good strategy against Pune in league matches
 iske alaava mumbai kii team ko gendbaaji bhi behatar kerani hogi, kyonki unhone pichley match main punjab ke khilaaf vankhede ke maidan par 200 se adhik ran lutaa die the
 Also, Lasith Malinga has proved to be expensive with the new ball
 unka form main aana jaruri he
 Anyway, the pitch of the Wankhede Stadium is helpful to the batsmen and hence a big score is expected
 pune kii takatpune kii ballebaaji kii baat karen to vah utani khaas nahin rahi
 Only Rahul Tripathi, captain Steve Smith and Ben Stokes have scored, but bowling has been Pune's strength
 uske tej gendbaajon jayadev unadakat (21 wicket), shardul thakur (8 wicket) or dainiel chrishchiyan (9 wicket) ne acha pradarshan kiya he, vahiin spin vibhaag main washington sundar or australia ke adam jampa pichley kuch maichon se acha khel rahe hai
 The absence of Ajinkya Rahane is a matter of concern for Pune's weakness
 is bich unke liye buree khabar yah he ki unke star olerounder ben stokes bhi swadesh laut gaye hai
 In such a situation, there will be pressure on both batting and bowling
 ben stokes ne is ipel main gend, balle ke saath-saath fielding se bhi khaasaa prabhavit kiya
 He tied his performance in all three departments
 unhone 11 maichon main 316 ran banaae, vahiin gendbaaji main 12 wicket jatke
 He also caught many charismatic catches
 team ko haalanki england ke ben stokes kii kami khalegi jo swadesh laut gaye hai
 In the match between Mumbai and Pune, the winning team will make it directly to the final in Hyderabad on 21 May, while the losing team will play the second qualifier in Bengaluru on 19 May
 sambhavit plaing ilevanmumbai indiens :lenndal simons, parthiv patel, nitish rana, rohit sharma (captain), kirone pollard, krunal pandya, hardik pandya, harbhajan singh, mishael maclenghan, jasprit bumraah or lasith malinga

 In it, she will talk about her life goals and Miss America's responsibilities

 He further said, now we will not decide the participants on these grounds
 1989 main miss america kaa taj pahanane vaali carlson yon utpeedan or # metoo andolan ke dauraan khulkar apni baat rakhti rahi hai
 In recent years, this beauty pageant was criticized by some women's groups and feminists
 unka kahana tha ki pratibhaagiyon ko swimasuits pehanaanaa outdated or sexist he
 Lienja Cornet held the title of Miss America in 1993
 unhone bhi pratiyogita se swimasoot compitishan hataane kaa samarthan kiya tha
 He said, "in the era of # metoo, i think it's a very good decision

 guuruuvaar ko ek baar phir lokapal vidheyak latak gaya
 This is not the first time that the Lokpal bill could not be passed even after a day-long discussion in Rajya Sabha
 40 varsh kaa sansad kaa itihaas gavaah he ki yah vidheyak ek paheli bana hua he
 The proceedings of the Rajya Sabha were adjourned indefinitely on Thursday night without the Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill, 2011 being passed
 rochak sanyog yah he ki ab tak jab bhi sansad main lokapal vidheyak par vichaar hua loksabhaa kii kaarywahi sthagit ho chuki thi

 The Lokpal Bill was then introduced on 28 July 1977
 ise sansad ke donon sadanon kii sanyukt samiti ko bheja gaya

 lokapal vidheyak, 1985 ko us saal 28 agast ko pesh kiya gaya or sansad kii sanyukt samiti ko bheja gaya
 However, the then government withdrew it due to flaws in covering many types of situations
 vidheyak ko waapas lete hue tatkaaleen sarkaar ne kaha ki vah janata kii shikayaton ke nivaaran ke saath baad main ek vyapak vidheyak lekar aegi
 In 1989, the Bill came again and was introduced on 29 December
 haalanki 13 march 1991 ko nauveen loksabhaa kii kaarywahi sthagit hone ke baad vidheyak nishprabhavi ho gaya
 The United Front government also introduced another bill on 13 September 1996
 use jaanch or report dene ke liye vibhaag se sambandhit grih mantralay kii sansadeey sthai samiti ko bheja gaya
 The Standing Committee presented its report in Parliament on May 9, 1997 and made extensive amendments to many of its provisions
 sarkaar sthai samiti kii anek siforeeshon par apana rukh tay karti tab tak 11veen loksabhaa kii kaarywahi sthagit ho gayi
 The last such attempt was made on 14 August 2001 by the bjp-led NDA government

 hamaare sahyogi santosh bhagat aapako adivasee inter mahavidhyalay, lalamatia le janaa chaahate hai
 Look at this college from the side of the moat, see the building of Adivasi Mahavidlaya
 aapako pehle khai kii gaharaai nazar aegi
 The trench has formed behind the college digging coal
 college ke thik neeche kii zamin ke neeche bhi avaidh rup se koyala nikaala jaataa rahaa, surang banati rahi or ab yah college bhi dhah saktaa
 College has become baseless, man's Aadhaar number is being created, college has become baseless
 surang itani gahari he ki college ke neeche pani kaa str or gaharaai main chalaa gaya, lihaaza shauchalay main pani tak nahin he
 From the top, this college looks like you will fly to London with your baby and Baba in the car that i will not put my kids in this college, my God is so horribly, let's go to Delhi, and watch some English news channel
 Too Feel That India Is Doing Something Great
 ij dis a college, luk at cambridge, luk at harvard
 Its Hindi translation means that on seeing this college, to save your liver from being torn to pieces here, you will run away in Delhi in a car
 bharat main samasya ko sirius karnaa he to pleez problem ko english main bolie, usase uskaa kairactor neshnal ho jaataa he
 So i mixed some English
 shauchalay kii taraf aate hi laga ki hadapppa ke thik baad ke kalkhand main aa gaye hai
 When i saw the female teacher sitting outside the office, she began to wonder how many years she had been waiting for the same day to pass or pass
 is tarah ke college main inke kitne armaan dhwast hue honge
 How much the system must have broken these
 1985 main bane is college ke bare main principal ne bataaya ki teen saal pehle isiel yahaan koyala nikaalane ai
 The promise was that the college would be shifted to another place
 abhi tak college shift nahin hua he
 ECL has given place for the college
 tender niklaa he magar kaam nahin shuru hua
 Till then can these children not be sent to a safe place in the rental building? iesiel to chali gai magar uske jane ke baad yahaan chor mafia koyala nikaalte rahe or college ke thik neeche surang bana gaye
 Water has dried up due to tunneling
 shauchalay main pani nahin he
 Blasts were carried out here to extract coal, causing the building to crack
 ziladhikari se lekar kulapati tak sabko shikaayat kii gai he, kii jaati rahati he magar kuch nahin hua he
 There are 21 teachers here, there are 500 students, in that sense, the teacher ratio is quite good, but how will the students sit here
 unhen dar lagata he ki imaarat kabhi bhi dhans sakati he
 You saw in the University Series that the problems are there even in the colleges of metros
 magar vahaan ke chaatro ke bolne main ek khaas tarah kii aakraamakata aa gai he
 There is apathy, but for a short time only the right sense is also awakened
 ham chaahate hai ki aap savita ko bolte sune
 Savita will surely have fifty skills, ability, but see how weak our education system has made her speak
 sido kanhu murmu uniwarsity ke tahat yah college aata he
 Sido Kanhu was a revolutionary and brave brother in himself
 magar kya unhone is din ke liye british satta ko chunauti di ki unke naam par bani uniwarsity ke ek college ke adivasee chaatro kii ye haalat kar di jaaegi
 Their civil perception will be taken away from them
 ham yah tasviir mahanagar se lekar kasbon tak main dekh rahe hai
 a viewer from London wrote that the university series is good but nothing will happen
 aap chhod dijie
 Will be left and will have to leave but hundreds of such information has come from the audience, which needs a long time to work on it
 aaj kal ankar hi kab tak he kisi ko pataa nahin, aapke bacchon kaa bhavishya kahaan kahaan barbaad ho rahaa he, ye ham kab tak bataate rahenge
 But think, change your priorities a little, you also listen to the false and long speeches of the leaders, believe them too but think a little about what is happening in the name of higher education
 haalat ye he ki is series par baat karne se ab shikshakon kii birdari jisaki sankhya lakhon main he vah bhi chup he
 The students are also silent
 isiilie yah series mahatvapurn hai ki ham chup kyon hai
 The first Chief Minister of Bihar, Shri Krishna Singh, laid the foundation stone of Godda College Godda in 1957 and was inaugurated by Indira Gandhi on 24 October 1959 as Congress President
 sthapana ke samay 56 acre zamin thi iske paas, ab 36 acre hi bachi he yani college kii 20 acre zamin bhai logon ne hajam kar lee
 When coal can eat college, then why can't mafia eat college land
 1987 se yahaan koi sthai principal nahin he phir bhi nack kii piaar team ke swaagat kaa board laga he
 Colleges in small towns are happy to consider b grade as a grade
 fasebuk par share karte hai ki bi grad mil gaya he
 What is the point of this college getting a b grade when there are not full teachers for 4000 students
 nack ek nayaa naatak he jiske bare main mujhe zyaada jaankaree nahin he
 The college itself calls Naik to pay a fee and let's give us the grade
 jab hamaare sahyogi santosh yahaan gaye to imtahaan ke kaaran kai vibhaag band the
 We could not see the situation from within
 principal ne bataaya ki angrezi, botni, bhugol or santhali main teacher nil hai yani zero hai
 Think there is a college for tribal students and there are no teachers of their language
 aisa ghotaalaa sirf hamaare hi desh main ho saktaa he
 Students here would have also voted many times, i do not believe that these people would have thought of their college while voting
 ashok thakur ji ke haath main to niti nirmaan nahin he
 What more can they do and say, but what they have said is enough
 admician lenaa chaahate hai to roak nahin sakate hai
 Is this the only and final aspiration of the students to get admission, is this the aspiration we discuss in Delhi that youth likes the aspiration but they are happy with the admissions, they did not bother with writing studies is
 aisa nahin ki chaatr nahin bolte hai magar unke bolne main adhikaar bodh nahin he
 Not a claim
 or bolte bhi hai to prashasan ko pataa he ki dhyaan dene kii zarurat nahin he
 The result is nothing
 vinoba bhaave ke naam par vot hota to netaa unki jayanti par bhi bees tees karod phoonk dete
 Vinoba ji was so plain that no one could dare to mix public money in the name of his idol
 jharkhand main unke naam par ek uniwarsity he
 Vinoba Bhave University, Hazaribagh
 magar iske sambanddh, patibaddh, aabaddh, ladd faddh ek college he
 Katras College Katrasgarh
 kataraas college dhanbad main he
 This college has been serving the nation since 26 June 1964
 dhanbad ke saansad hai pashupati nath singh
 The biggest feature of this college is that there are 982 students on one teacher

 There are 982 students on one teacher
 is college main saadhe baahar hazaar chaatr padhate hai
 The gate of this college is fine, from outside it will feel that it is quite fine but as soon as you enter inside, the education system of India will be waiting for you in a phantom form
 is maidan ko dekhakar niraash hone kii zarurat nahin he, bharat ke noujvaan tajmahal ko lekar hone vaali bahason main mast hai, ve sundar sapane dekh rahe hai, jo bana he use tod do kii raajnneeti sikh rahe hai, jaise unhone apane is college ke saath kiya he
 Canteen runs in this old building, new building has been built, there are facilities at least according to the list
 yah bhi to sochie ki agar mandir masjid yani hindu muslim dibet nahin hota to bharat ke chaatr kya karte
 The course is not complete that one has to sit in examination
 semester aa jaataa he wo bhi chah maheene kii deree se chal rahaa he
 Both railways and colleges run late in India
 ek shikshak kya 982 chaatro kaa boj sah saktaa he
 Watching this episode of prime time, you will eat more than two poori, be happy that not only you, but also your neighbor's child is being ruined
 bihar kaa hi nahin jharkhand vaala bhi barbaad ho rahaa he
 At this, two pooris will be eaten
 tivi on karke do-do ghante netaa kaa bhaashan suniyegaa
 Speech from here, speech from there, speech by day, speech by night
 bhaashan bhaashan, bhaashan bhaashan, gaate hue so jaaiyegaa
 The principal says that there is no shortage of toilets but a student said that three and a half thousand girls have a toilet
 niyantran yahaan mahatvapurn factor he
 Millions of students are getting rotten system, they are in control everywhere
 bharat kii ucch shiksha ne lakhon chaatro ko college naam ke godaam main bharkar control kiya he
 He is not left worth anything
 principal sahab ne thik kaha ki ve bhale apane baap ke control main na hon magar unke yani system ke control main hai
 The college has one professor in Political Science, Sanskrit, Economics
 jabaki har class main 300 se 400 bachche hai
 12 professors for 12,500 students
 do puri or kha lijie
 No one
 vishwa guru banane ke naam par netaa log naujavaanon ko chuuran bech rahe hai
 There is no question from the front MP, no question from the MLA, no question from the Education Minister and there is a debate about Patel, like Patel and Nehru have to come and answer
 ise kehete hai saamne gaddha he to himalay kii chotii dikhaa do
 People will gladly fall into the pit watching the Himalayas
 yahaan ke chaatr netaa ko bhi suniye
 Don't go on the rosary, kurta and tika, but listen to the student leader, in this risky environment, someone has decided to become a leader
 itani positive story main nahin jhel saktaa
 Some move towards negative story
 is series se ek baat kaa pataa chali ki shiksha mantri sirf shapath lene or zila main apni car dikhaane ke liye hote hai
 If you go to the room of ministers, you will definitely get a white towel on the back of the chair, that towel is also on their car seat
 safed tauliya na mili to mantri banane kaa sukh nahin miltaa he
 There are two types of white towel
 ek bada vaala jo kursi par peeth se lekar seat tak bicha hota he or ek chota vaala jo brifces ke upar yaa kandhe par hota he
 Not a professor in class, but the white towel is everywhere
 dehradun se hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ne ek khabar bheji he ki uttarakhand takniki uniwarsity ke visi ko barkhaast kar diya gaya he
 vcs were removed for the first time in the history of Mumbai University, similarly vcs have been removed for the first time in the history of Uttarakhand Technical University
 tippaniyan The Governor has removed the VC of the Technical University
 2005 main isi imaarat ko kaaphi bhavy bani he, 20 karod main bhavy to banani hi chahie, lekin is puri uniwarsity main maatr 4 karlk hi aise staff hai jo permanent hai
 You are not laughing either

 Eat six puris
 is uniwarsity main chaar hi permanent hai wo bhi clerk
 The entire university operates on contract workers
 tehari, tanakpur, gopeshwar, dehradun ke chaar technical college hai iske tahat
 Under this, 4000 thousand students come to darken their future in 60 courses
 vaise anya collejon ke chaatro ko mila den to 35000 chaatro kaa bedaa gark karne kaa jimmaa yah uniwarsity uthaae hue hai
 It is alleged that the book of two crores is not getting the book, the employees were arbitrarily placed on the contract, now all these are normal allegations, then i do not understand why VC Pradeep Kumar Garg was removed
 visi sahab par aarope he ki ve asthaayee karmchaaree se rajyapal ke saath patrachaara karvaa rahe the
 Now there is no permanent, otherwise it is natural
 magar kanuunan ve aisa nahin kar sakate the
 200 assistant professors are on contract at this university
 theke par hone ke kaaran mahila lecturaron ke saath jo ho rahaa he wo ham kis kis rajya se aapako ek hi baat bataaen
 This was the eighteenth issue of the university series, you eat two poori more and take a break

 Our colleague Santosh Bhagat wants to take you to Adivasi Inter College, Lalmatia
 is college ko khai kii taraf se dekhie, adivasee mahavidlaay kii imaarat ko dekhie
 You will first see the depth of the trench
 koyala khodate khodate college ke peeche khai ban gai he
 Coal was also illegally extracted under the ground just below the college, the tunnel continued to be built and now the college could collapse
 college aadharahin ho chukaa he, aadmi kaa aadhaar number ban rahaa he, college aadharahin ho chukaa he
 The tunnel is so deep that the water level below the college went further deep, so there is no water in the toilet
 upar se yah college aisa dikhataa he jise dekhakar aap apane baby or bebaa ko lekar gaadi main bithakar landan bhaag jaaenge ki ai vil note put maay kids in dis college, moy god its so harible, lats go tu dely, and watch sam ingshil news channel tu feel dait india iz duing samathing great

 iskaa hindi anuwaad yahi hua ki aap is college ko dekhte hi, apane jigar ke tukade ko yahaan tukade tukade hone se bachaane ke liye car main bithakar dilli bhaag jaaenge
 If you want to solve the problem in India, please speak the problem in English, it makes its character national
 isliye maine thodi angrezi mila di
 As soon as we came towards the toilet, it seemed that i had come in the period just after Harappa
 karyaalay ke baahar baithi mahila teacher ko baithe dekha to sochane laga ki wo na jane kitne varshon se isi tarah din ke dhalane yaa biit jane kaa intazaar kar rahi hai
 How many armaments must have been destroyed in such a college
 system ne inhen kitna tod diya hoga
 Regarding this college, built in 1985, the principal said that three years ago ECL came to extract coal here
 vaada tha ki college ko duusari jagah shift kar diya jayega
 The college has not shifted yet
 college ke liye isiel ne jagah de di he
 Tender has come out but the work has not started
 tab tak kya in bacchon ko kiraaye kii imaarat main kisi surakshit jagah par nahin bheja saktaa he
 The EACL went away, but after it left, the thieves kept extracting coal here and made a tunnel just below the college
 surang ke kaaran pani tak suukh gaya he
 There is no water in the toilet
 koyala nikaalane ke liye yahaan blast kiye gaye jiske kaaran imaarat main daraar aa gai
 Everyone has been complained from the District Magistrate to the Vice Chancellor, they keep going but nothing has happened
 21 teacher hai yahaan par, 500 chaatr hai, us lihaaz se shikshak kaa anupaat to kaaphi acha he magar yahaan chaatr kaise bathenge
 They fear that the building may collapse at any time
 aapane uniwarsity siries main dekha ki samasyaayein to mahanagaron ke collejon main bhi hai
 But there is a certain kind of aggression in the students speaking there
 udaseenta he magar thode samay ke liye hi sahi adhikaar bodh bhi jaag jaataa he
 We want you to hear Savita speak
 savita main yakeenan pachaason kaushal honge, kaabiliyat hogi magar dekhie hamaari shiksha vyavastha ne use bolne ke maamle main kitna kamazor bana diya he
 This college comes under Sido Kanhu Murmu University

 But did he challenge the British authority to this day that tribal students of a college in the university named after him would be reduced to this condition
 unase unka naagarik bodh hi chin liya jayega
 We are seeing this picture from metros to towns
 landan se ek darshak ne likhaa he ki uniwarsity series acchhee he magar kuch nahin hoga
 You leave chhot to jayega hi or chhodana bhi padegaa lekin aap darshakon main se saikadon aisi jaankariyaan aa chuki hai jin par kaam karne ke liye lanbaa samay chahie
 Nowadays, no one knows how long the anchor is, where we will tell the future of your children, where they are being ruined

 The situation is that by talking about this series, the number of teachers, who number in lakhs, is also silent
 chaatr bhi chup hai
 That is why this series is important why we are silent
 bihar ke pehle mukhyamantri shri krishna singh ne 1957 main godda college godda kii buniyaad rakhi thi or indira gandhi ne congress adhyaksh ke taur par 24 aktubar 1959 ko iskaa udghaatan kiya tha
 At the time of the establishment, there was 56 acres of land near it, now only 36 acres is left, i

 Share on Facebook that a b grade has been found
 4000 chaatro ke liye jab puure shikshak nahin hai to is college ko bi grad milane kaa kya matlab he
 Naik is a new drama that i don't know much about
 college hi nack ko fees dekar bulaati he ki aaiye hamen grad dijie
 When our colleague Santosh went here, many departments were closed due to examination
 ham bheetar se haal nahin dekh sake
 The principal said that in English, Botany, Geography and Santhali, teachers are indigo
 sochie adivasee chaatro ke liye college he or vahaan unheen kii bhashaa ke teacher nahin hai
 Such a scam can only happen in our country
 yahaan ke chaatro ne bhi kai baar vot diya hoga, mujhe yakeen nahin hota ki vot dete vakt in logon ne kabhi apane college kaa khyaal kiya hoga
 Ashok Thakur ji does not have policy making in his hands
 isse zyaada ve kya kar sakate hai or kah sakate hai magar jo kah diya kaaphi he
 If you want to take admission, we cannot stop it
 kya chaatro kii yahi ekmaatr or antim mahatvakanksha he ki admician ho jaae, kya yahi wo espereshan he jiske bare main ham dilli main charchaa karte hai ki youth ko espereshan pasand he par wo to admician se hi khush he, padhai likhaai saadhe baees se dukhi nahin he
 It is not that the students do not speak but they do not have the right to speak
 daawa nahin he
 And even speaking, the administration knows that there is no need to pay attention
 nateeja kuch nahin hota he
 Had there been a vote in the name of Vinoba Bhave, the leaders would have blown twenty three million on his birth anniversary
 vinoba ji the hi itane sade ki koi himmat nahin kar paata he ki unki murti ke naam par janata ke paise ko mitti main milaayaa jaae
 He has a university in Jharkhand
 vinoba bhaave uniwarsity, hazaribagh
 But its affiliated, committed, bound and ladder is a college
 kataraas college katarasgarh
 Katras College is in Dhanbad
 26 june 1964 se yah college raashtra kii seva kar rahaa he
 Pashupati Nath Singh is the MP of Dhanbad
 is college kii sabase badi kubi he ki yahaan ek shikshak par 982 chaatr hai
 How many
 ek shikshak par 982 chaatr hai
 Thousands and a half thousand students study in this college
 is college kaa get to thik he, baahar se lagegaa ki kaaphi thik thaak he lekin jaise jaise aap bheetar pravesh karenge bharat kii shiksha vyavastha pret rup dhaaran kar aapkaa intazaar kar rahi hogi
 One does not have to be disappointed to see this ground, the youth of India are busy in the debates about the Taj Mahal, they are dreaming beautiful, learning the politics of breaking what is made, like they did with this college Have done is puraani imaarat main canteen chalati he, nai imaarat ban gai he, vahaan suvidhaayen hai kam se kam suchi ke anusaar
 Also, imagine what the students of India would have done if the temple had not been a mosque ie Hindu Muslim Debate
 course puraa hota nahin ki imtahaan main baithna hota he
 The semester comes that is also running late by six months
 rail or college donon india main let chalate hai
 Can a teacher bear the burden of 982 students? prime time ke is episod ko dekhakar aap do puri zyaada kha lijiega, khush hoiyegaa ki aapkaa hi nahin, aapke padosi kaa baccha bhi barbaad ho rahaa he

 Speech speech, speech speech, sing and sleep
 principal kehete hai ki shauchalay kii kami nahin he magar ek chaatra ne bataaya ki saadhe teen hazaar ladakiyon par ek shauchalay he
 Control is the important factor here
 lakhon chaatro ko sadi hui vyavastha mil rahi he, ve har jagah niyantran main hai
 Higher education in India has controlled millions of students by filling them in a warehouse named college
 unhen kisi laayak nahin choda he
 The principal said right that he may not be under the control of his father but is in control of his system
 is college main polytical science, sanskrit, ichonmiks, main ek ek professor hai
 While there are 300 to 400 children in each class
 12,500 chaatro ke liye 12 professor
 Eat two more puris

 It is said that if there is a pit in front, then show the top of the Himalayas

 Listen to the student leader here too
 maala, kurta or tikaa par mat jaaiyegaa magar chaatr netaa ko suniye, is jokhim bhare maahaul main kisi ne netaa banane kaa faisla kiya he yahi bahut he
 i cannot afford such a positive story
 kuch negative story kii taraf chalate hai
 One thing revealed from this series is that the Education Minister is only there to take an oath and show his car in the district
 mantriyon ke kamare main jaaenge to kursi ke peeche safed tauliya zarur paaenge, wo tauliya unki car kii seat par bhi hoti he
 If you do not get a white towel, there is no pleasure of becoming a minister
 do prakaar kaa safed tauliya hota he
 a large one that sits on the chair from the back to the seat and a smaller one which is above the briefcase or on the shoulder
 class main professor nahin, magar safed tauliya har jagah he
 Our colleague from Dehradun, Dinesh Mansera has sent a news that the VC of Uttarakhand Technical University has been dismissed

 The comments rajyapal ne technical uniwarsity ke visi ko hataa diya he
 This building has become quite grand in 2005, it should be made grand in 20 crores, but in this entire university, only 4 curls are such staff who are permanent

 There are four technical colleges under Tehri, Tanakpur, Gopeshwar, Dehradun
 is tahat ke antargat 60 course main 4000 hazaar chaatr apana future dark karne aate hai
 By the way, if the students of other colleges are included, then the University is taking up the responsibility to grill a fleet of 35000 students
 aarope he ki do karod kaa hisaab kitaab nahin mil rahaa he, theke par manamaane tareeke se karmchaaree rakhe gaye, ab ye sab to saamaanya aarope hai to phir visi pradeep kumaar garg ko kyon hataaya gaya ye mujhe samaj nahin aa rahaa he
 VC Sahab is accused of having a temporary staffing with the Governor
 ab vahaan koi permanent he hi nahin to yah to swaabhaavik he
 But legally they could not do it
 is uniwarsity main 200 assistant professor sanvida par hai
 Being on contract, what is happening with women lecturers, we should tell you the same thing from which state
 uniwarsity series kaa yah atharahawaan ank tha, aap do puri or kha lijie or brake le lijie

 There is apathy, but for a short time only the right sense is also awakened

 1987 se yahaan koi sthai principal nahin he phir bhi nack kii piaar team ke swaagat kaa board laga he
 Colleges in small towns are happy to consider b grade as a grade

 What is the point of this college getting a b grade when there are not full teachers for 4000 students
 nack ek nayaa naatak he jiske bare main mujhe zyaada jaankaree nahin he
 The college itself calls Naik to pay a fee and let's give us the grade

 For example, you can only look at the leadership of the new generation in the Shiv Sena, whose view on the city is completely different
 uddhav thakare ke bete aditya abhi college se nikle hi hai lekin lambey samay baad unhone shahar ke liye sarvaadhik aadhunik vichaar pesh kiya he ki mumbai kii raaton ko or jagamag bana diya jaae
 The Shiv Sena is not more liberal in any way than the BJP, but it is undoubtedly more urban in its mind
 mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis aadhunik hai, lekin sudur nagpur se aate hai
 In terms of difference in perspective, there is a difference of ground and sky in Mumbai and Nagpur
 nagpur beshak latur nahin he, jahaan ke rahane vaale aar
 R
 patil ne mumbai ke dance baron ko band karavaaya tha
 Mumbai is the most liberal city in India, and Nagpur is the most troubled society of this country
 ise sanyog yaa asangat nahin kah sakate ki nagpur main hi aresas kaa mukchayalay bhi he
 Fadnavis is compelled to perform far better in front of Nagpur headquarters than Manohar Lal Khattar of Haryana because his political stature has not grown so far that he can cover this circle
 modi kaa kad haalanki itnaa bada avashya he ki ve apni siyaasi takat kaa istemaal shaharon ke sanchaalan main nae vichaaron ko lagu karne ke liye kar sakate hai
 It may seem premature to talk of moving the capital of Maharashtra out of Mumbai elsewhere, but the process of getting the capital out of the ministry should start now
 mumbai, nagpur yaa latur kaa upnivesh hone ke laayak nahin he
 If this experiment succeeds, it can become a forerunner for a crumbling urban India

 is suchi main sharad pavaar kaa naam hamaari nigaah se chhot jaataa he kyonki apane naam par unhone cricket se judaa jo sabase prabhavakaari smarak banwaaya he, vah koi stadium nahin balki ek club, ek maidan or ek academy he
 Apparently, its name is Sharad Pawar Indoor Cricket Academy which is located in Mumbai's bandra-kurla campus
 pichley hafte unhone mujhe academy kii saiyr karavaate hue bataaya ki isamen maujuud bowling mashine or ucch gati vaale prashikshan camere australia kii cricket academy ke baraabar darje ke hai
 Pawar said that the feeling of Englishness in the club house is born because his wooden ceiling and furniture have been imported from England
 yahaan se aasmaan shandaar dikhataa he
 It is BKC, Mumbai's newest financial center, shiny, modern and glassy
 aap ise bharat kaa sabase vishaal kshitij-vrutt bhi kah sakate hai
 The sky looks spherical due to the circular shape of the ONGC building

 After this, banks, financial institutions and diamond bullion business started flourishing there
 isi kaa nateeja he ki aaj mumbai main teen shahari centre hai- bikasi, nariman point or varli-parel- sabhi ek sankari or lambavat rekha ke kinare based hue
 Obviously, there can be nothing worse for the traffic on this route

 ! At the Bharatiya Janata Party headquarters on Friday, 15 February, 6 of the 7 rooms for the General Secretaries on the third floor were closed
 sirf ek cameraa jo kailash vijayawargeey kaa he, khulaa tha
 There was no movement of any activist or other people as Kailash, sitting in his room in the afternoon, was telling the Chief Ministers of all the BJP ruled states by phone to listen to the instructions of National President Amit Shah to ensure his literacy
 nirdesh yah tha ki pulavama hamale main shahid hue siarpief javaanon ke antim sanskaar main siem yaa rajya sarkaar ke mantri jarur upasthit rahen
 When Vijayvargiya was asked by BJP President Amit Shah to convey the party's instructions to the Chief Ministers (around 2 pm) before that he (amit Shah) had received information from various states that a spontaneous mob had gathered against the terrorist attack on the CRPF jawans
 Has been dilli sahit vibhinn rajyon main logon ke swatahsfoort hujum ko dekhte hue bhaajapa yuva morcha or mahila morcha se kaha gaya ki ve is bheed ko netritv den lekin is saavdhaanee ke saath ki bhaajapa kaa binar poster lekar bheed kaa netritv na karen or jahaan jarurat ho, vahaan sirf bheed kaa hissaa ban kar unki aawaaj ko buland karen
 Why and why was this exercise of the BJP in a cautious and careful manner? "this public sentiment is the agenda of the 2019 mandate," says do-tuk, a senior party leader
 ek aisa agenda jise kisi party yaa vyakti ne nahin balki desh ne tay kar diya he
 "seeing the public sentiment, BJP workers paid tributes to the martyrs by organizing tribute meetings at all the district centers of the country on 17 February
 party adhyaksh ne saaf nirdesh diya tha ki ye kaarykram kisi band kamare yaa haul main nahin hon balki kisi khule or saarvajanik sthaan par yojit kiye jaaen
 This is so that the tribute meeting should be connected to the common people rather than being associated with the BJP
 bhaajapa ke ranneetikaar yah maan rahe hai ki pulavama kii ghatana aise samay hui he jab bhaajapa ko 2019 ke liye ek prabhavi mudde kii darkaar thi
 In 2014, Narendra Modi himself became the agenda of the mandate
 unhen 2013 kii june main goa main hui bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye campan cameti kaa mukhiya bananaa bhaajapa ke liye majaburi ban gaya tha, kyonki kaaryakarini se pehle bhaajapa ke har kaarykram main modi-modi ke naare lagane shuru ho gaye the
 In September 2013, Modi was declared the prime ministerial candidate, keeping in mind the sentiments of the people and activists
 bhaajapa ko iskaa laabh bhi mila or party ne pehali baar purna bahumat se adhik siten (282) hasil kin
 Why did any party get an absolute majority after 1984, that is, after 30 years? a party general secretary says, "this was possible because in 2014, Janbhavna was to make Modi the prime minister
 "pulavama kii ghatana se pehle 2019 ke liye jo chunavi maahaul ban gaya tha or banataa ja rahaa tha usamen ekajute janabhaavana jaisi koi baat nahin thi
 All political parties were trying to change the electoral discussion according to their stand
 congress or duusari vipakshi partiyaan rafel, sibiai or duusari jaanch agenciyon ke durupyog, kisaanon kii durdasha jaise mudde oochaal rahi thim or bhaajapa in muddon par rakshaatmak rukh apana rahi thi
 At the same time, it was trying to contest the 2019 elections on the issue of Modi's leadership ability
 iske alaava ram mandir, tripal talaak or aarakshan jaise siyaasi hathiyaaron ke jariye bhaajapa apana kila bachaane kii jugat main lagi thi
 There is no indication like 2014 about Modi, this was also indicated by the results of various surveys
 bhaajapa is tathy ko samaj rahi thi
 But Pulwama has left all these equations and issues behind
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya pravaktaa or rajyasabha saansad jiviel narsimha raav kehete hai ki ab yah puri tarah saaf he ki 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye janamanas kaa mudda ab aatankwaad ke khatme kaa ban gaya he or sabhi log piem narendra modi ke saath hai
 Realizing this narrator of public sentiment, BJP president Amit Shah himself has been trying to bring Modi as the leader to give a befitting reply to terrorism, instead of referring to the development work of the PM
 17 farvari ko assam ke lakhimpur sthit saboti stadium main amit shah ne party ke yuva pravaah vijay lakshya kaarykram main kaha, ''hamaare vir shaheedon kaa balidaan vyarth nahin jayega kyonki is baar centre main narendra modi ke netritv main bhaajapa kii sarkaar he
 The biggest priority of the Modi government is the security of the nation and no compromise can be reached on this issue
 " shah kaa yah bayaan aise samay main aayaa he jab puure desh main raashtra kii suraksha charchaa kii praathamikta list main sabase upar he
 It is not easy after the Rahpulwama incident, the Modi government has the opportunity to live up to the sentiments of the people
 lekin maujuuda sthiti main yah avasar se adhik chunauti dikh rahaa he
 BJP leaders are also believing that options like diplomatic methods or covert surgical strikes or killing Kashmiri terrorists are not going to work
 jab tak logon ko sidhe taur par yah nahin dikhegaa ki bharat ne pakistani javaanon or aatankwaadiyon par usase badi karrwai kii he jo aatankiyon ne pulavama main javaanon par kii thi, tab tak janabhaawanaaon par khara nahin utraa ja saktaa
 But in the current situation, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find alternatives for such action in a hurry
 yahi sabase badi chunauti he
 In the indirect conversation, BJP leaders are assuming that as long as it takes revenge for Pulwama, anger will start to rise against the government in public
 vipaksh bhi us maukey ke intjaar main baitha he jab sarkaar kii taraf se deree ho yaa chhitput karrwai ho taaki vah sarkaar ke khilaaf maahaul banane ke liye aage aae
 It has started
 congress ke media vibhaag ke pramukh randeep singh surajevaala kehete hai, ''modi protocol ko taak par rakhkar unka (saudi crown prince mohammad bin salmaan) bhavy swaagat karte hai jinhone aatankwaad ke poshak pakistan ko 20 billian dollar kaa tohfa diya or pakistan ke aatankavirohi ravaiye kii prashansa kii
 "surjewala does not stop here, he says," The people of the country are seeing that the Prime Minister is embracing the person who is in support of Pakistan
 kya modi saudi arab se pakistan ke saath die sanyukt bayaan ko waapas lene kii maang maang karne kaa saahas dikhaaenge, jo masood ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatankwaadi ghoshit karne kii dridhtaa ko thukraata he
 "congress leaders say that no political party can ignore that our PM is embracing a man who is opposing efforts to declare Masood Azhar an international terrorist
 kul milakar pulavama hamale ke baad janabhaavana kii jis lahar par bhaajapa or modi sarkaar savaar hui he, yadi use kinare tak laane main party safal hui to janadesh modi sarkaar ke saath hoga, nahin to phir yah lahar sarkaar or bhaajapa ke liye vah bhavar sabit ho sakati he jiskaa intjaar vipaksh bhi kar rahaa he

 ) British Prime Minister Boris Johnson managed to cross the first hurdle of Parliament on Tuesday for his Brexit Bill
 sansad main voting ke dauraan unke prastaav ko 299 ke mukaable 329 maton kaa samarthan mila
 This means that the Brexit Agreement with the European Union can now become law, but it will have to be agreed in the House of Commons within three days
 agar saansad samay seemaa ko khaarij kar dete hai or europea sangh taarikh badhaane kii manjuuri de detaa he to aisi sthiti main johnson ne vidheyak ko waapas lene kii dhamkee di he, or vah 31 oktober ko alag hone kii nirdhaarit samay seemaa main deree karne ke bajaae aam chunaav karana chahenge
 Johnson put it up for discussion in the House of Commons after the Brexit Agreement was published on Monday night
 bataa den ki kuch din pehle hibritain ke saansadon ne europea sangh (iyu) ke saath pradhanmantri boris johnson kii sahmati ke baad hue bracit (brexit) samjhaute ko taalane ke paksh main shanivaar ko matdaan kiya tha
 The mps voted in favor of an amendment to defer a decision on the Prime Minister's agreement
 bibisi kii report ke anusaar, saansadon ne jaruri britani kanoon paas hone tak letvin sanshodhan ke jariye bracit samjhaute main deree ke liye vot kiya tha
 The decision was warmly welcomed by the people at the People's Vote rally in Parliament Square after the Letwin Amendment was passed in the House of Commons
 bibisi kii ek report ke anusaar, conservative party ke saansad letvin sanshodhan par sarkaar kii haar ke baad kaamans chembar se baahar jate dikhe the
 Johnson, however, insisted that he would not plead with the EU to extend time for Brexit, although after the move by mps, he was obliged to urge the EU for further delays in Brexit
 is kadam ke baad sansad main agle saptaah tak johnson ke samjhaute par matdaan nahin ho saktaa he
 The Letwin Amendment was proposed by Oliver Letwin
