 "this comment may have been made with humor but it is indicative of the shrinking size and mass base of the dominant local or regional parties (whether it holds national party status) in the states
" to kya bhaajapa ab 'congress mukt bharat' ke saath 'kshetreey dal mukt bharat' kii ore bad rahi he?party mahasachiv arun singh kehete hai, ''vah jamaana lad gaya jab koi bhi dal dharm, jati or parivaar kii duhai dekar vot hasil kar letaa tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the basis of his work, has set the narrative that only those who work day and night for public welfare can get votes
 jameen par logon ke bich jaakar kaam karata ho
 The BJP is doing this, so any national or regional party that is not realizing this reality is losing its base and size
 ''darasal, pradhanmantri narendra modi or party adhyaksh amit shah ke netritv main bhaajapa ne sthaneey dalon par apane nishane kii patakatha to 2014 main hi likh di thi, jab bhaajapa ko apane dam par bahumat hasil ho gaya tha
 Another general secretary of the party says, "after becoming the national president, Amit Shah's first focus was on strengthening the party in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, where local parties were in a strong position
" ''shaayad iske peeche yah samaj rahi ho ki pashchim, madhya or uttar bharat ke rajyon ke alaava baaki rajyon main party kaa vistaar tabhi ho saktaa he, jab kshetreey dalon kaa janaadhar or aakaar ghate
 Its background was set by a substantial victory in 2014, especially in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 isamen sabase bada morcha uttar pradesh kaa hi tha
 Shah was the general secretary in-charge of the party in Uttar Pradesh in 2014 before becoming BJP president and during that time 401 out of 403 legislators had migrated to the constituencies
 isliye 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan jab shah yah daawa kar rahe the ki uttar pradesh main bhaajapa 2014 ke 73 (apana dal ke saath) se zyada seat jeetegi, to vah sirf party kaaryakartaaon kaa manobal badhaane ke liye hi nahin tha
 They used to tell party officials that they are making this claim because "I have understood Uttar Pradesh
" duusari partiyon ke netaaon (mulaayam singh ke alaava) main koi aisa nahin he jo puure pradesh ko samajhataa he
 "uttar Pradesh was not the only one in Shah's count
" unhone apane mahasachivon ko un rajyon main puri tarah se jhonk diya, jahaan sthaneey dal majboot sthiti main rahe hai
 He deployed general secretary Arun Singh to Odisha, Kailash Vijayvargiya to West Bengal, Anil Jain to Haryana and Jharkhand, Bhupendra Yadav to Bihar and Saroj Pandey to Maharashtra without a break
 shah niyamit rup se in mahasachivon se rajya main hui har gatividhi kaa byora lete the or jarurat padane par in rajyon main khud bhi camp karte rahe
 BJP media department head and Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni says, "as a party BJP is strengthening itself in every state
 sabhi ko yah haq he ki vah apni party kaa vistaar kare
 What is the fault of the BJP now that the Congress is almost finished in most states
 congress nahin he to un rajyon main jo duusare dal hai uske samarthak pradhanmantri narendra modi ke vikaas kii niti ko lekar bhaajapa kii ore rukh kar rahe hai
 "what strategy was adopted? Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh and Rashtriya Lok Dal in western Uttar Pradesh have been in a strong position on the basis of their caste equation
" chunaav ke dauraan rashtriya str par sakriy bhaajapa yaa congress tisare or chauthe number kii party ke taur par mukaable main rahati thim
 But before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP came up with a plan to break into the vote bank of both SP and BSP
 basapa ke gaiyr-jatav or sapa ke gaiyr-yadav vot bank main send lagaakar bhaajapa ne in donon partiyon ko kamjor kar diya
 Modi wave from above gave these two parties almost complete edge in the state
 phir 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa in donon dalon ke vot bank main or send lagane main safal rahi
 Also, on the basis of popular plan like Ujjwala, BJP made itself a point of discussion in every household
 sthiti kii najaakat or bhaajapa kii akramakata ko dekhte hue sapa-basapa-ralod ne gathbandhan kiya lekin yah prayog safal nahin hua kyonki bhaajapa yah sandesh dene main safal ho gai ki yah chunaav pradhanmantri chunane ke liye ho rahaa he, sapa or basapa ke netaa piem banane kii res main nahin hai
 Similarly, in the 2015 assembly elections in Bihar, JD (U), RJD and Congress fought together and succeeded in stopping BJP
 bhaajapa ke netaa yah maan rahe hai ki bihar main nitish kumaar kii party kaa apana vot bank bhale na ho lekin nitish kumaar vahaan ek brands hai or ve rajya main hue vikaas kaaryon ke liye jane jate hai
 In such a situation, BJP along with Nitish Kumar fought equally and won
 rajd yahaan bina ek seat jite haashie par chalaa gaya
 But who is the brand ambassador of JD (U) after Nitish? "here the NDA will pick its own leader," says a senior Bihar BJP leader
 ''darasal bihar main jad(you) yaa maharashtra main shivasena apane dam par nirnaayak nahin hai
 These parties perform effectively only when they are with the BJP
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa se alag hokar ladgaye par nitish kii party sirf do seat jeet saki thi
 Similarly, Shiv Sena contested the 2014 assembly elections in Maharashtra, separated from BJP and BJP became the largest party here
 to kya bhaajapa ke nishane par kahin shivasena or jad(you) bhi to nahin hai?jad(you) ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''baat sirf chunaav jeetne kii nahin he
 Both these parties are losing their cadre at the hands of BJP
 shivasena or bhaajapa ke kader main vaicharik rup se kaaphi samanta he
 In such a situation, if the Shiv Sena is weak, then the cadre will automatically go to the BJP
 jad(you) ke saath bhi yahi he
 Both BJP and JD (U) are doing politics in Bihar in the name of development, so if JD (U) and BJP ever split, then the cadre of JD (U) is more likely to go to BJP because the party's organization in the state is JD (U) is in a much stronger position than the organization
 ''lekin kya pashchim bengal or odisha jaise rajyon main kshetreey dalon ko aasaani se hilaa dena bhaajapa ke bas main he? in rajyon main na to bhaajapa kaa sanghathan majboot he, na hi vah trinmul yaa bijedy ke kader ke makul he
 Political commentator Rajat Rai says, "the BJP is very deliberately pursuing a policy of weakening regional parties
 pichley teen-chaar saal main pashchim bengal main darjanon kii taadaad main trinmul ke bade or prabhavi netaaon ko bhaajapa apane paale main laane main kaamyaab rahi
 Even less in Odisha, but there too the party is doing the same
 andhra pradesh main rajyasabha ke 4 saansadon ko bhaajapa apane saath le gai
 Where the bjp's organization is weak, the BJP is strengthening itself by strengthening the strong people of other parties
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke nattejey iske gavaah hai
 "the cadre that the BJP needs to compete with a leader like Mamta has also got ready
" vampanthi partiyon kaa kader haal ke chunaav main mamata ko haraane ke liye bhaajapa kii ore chalaa gaya
 The forward thinking BJP is planning to become the most prominent party in every state for the next five years
 khaskar un rajyon main jahaan sthaneey dalon kaa dabadabaa he
 According to this plan, Amit Shah's goal of getting 50 percent votes
 yah lakshya kaise hasil hoga? bhaajapa ke rashtriya pravaktaa ji

 Says Narasimha Rao, "the leaders who formed regional parties on their own have now aged or are not active
" lalu yadav mulaayam singh, sharad pavaar, chandrababu naidu, mayawati, kesiar, echdi devegoda, shibu sorain jaise netaaon ke baad in dalon ke paas doosraa koi nahin he
 The successor who is or is likely to be formed, got the party created by him automatically, but the successor does not see the spark that was among the founders of these parties
 ''lekin kya ek rashtriya dal (bhaajapa) rajyon main sthaneey dal kaa vikalp ban saktaa he? kshetreey dalon kaa tanabana sthaneey jaruraton or muddon par aadhaarit hota he isliye uskaa swaroop rashtriya dal se mail nahin khaataa
 For example, the BJP unit of Andhra Pradesh may demand special status for the state but it will be difficult for the central BJP to do so
 bihar ke sandarbh main bhi yahi baat he
 Devesh Kumar, vice-president of Bihar BJP, says, "the specialty in BJP is that it handles the issues of both the state and the center in an equal manner
 darasal bhaajapa logon tak yah baat tarkpurna rup se le jane main safal rahi he ki jaij or jaruri muddon par party kisi bhi rajya ke hiton kii upeksha nahin hone degi
 "actually, when the BJP was an ally of TDP in Andhra Pradesh, it demanded special state status
 lekin bakaul devesh kumaar, ''bhaajapa ne aarthik rup se rajya ko usase kahin zyada aarthik madad kii jitna vishesh rajya kaa darja hasil karne ke baad bhi rajya ke hisse main nahin aata
 He therefore argues that the BJP is running an equally popular government in those states where it was previously believed to be occupied by a local party
 baharhaal, uttar pradesh, assam, tripura or ab bengal main bhi bhaajapa ko badi safalataa mil chuki he
 In the next assembly elections, the contest is set to be between BJP and Trinamool
 jin rajyon main abhi kshetreey dal satta yaa vipaksh main hai, vahaan aane vaale dinon main bhaajapa ek nae vikalp ke rup main jagah bana rahi he
 Gone are the days for regional parties when there was no alternative to a third party
 bhaajapa ne is khaali jagah ko bhar diya he
 If local parties do not warn, then BJP will move from 'congress-mukt Bharat' to 'regional party-mukt Bharat'
 ththgin netaaon ke dam par kshetreey dal bane the, ve ab umradraj ho chuke hai or sakriy nahin rah gaye hai

 Jealousy and fear speak in the highest of these voices
 unhone shishyon ko sikhaaya tha ki dimag ko shant rakhane ke liye kaise saans len, sochen, khaaen, chalem or dhyaan karen

 The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notices to senior BJP leaders - LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi - in the Babri demolition case
 nyaayalay ne unhen yah notice elahabaad hai court ke us faisle ko chunauti dene vaali yachika par diya he, jisamen 1992 ke babari masjid vidhwans maamle main donon netaaon ko aapraadhik shadyantr ke aarope se mukt kar diya gaya tha
 Learn about the case in detail
 
 
 - 6 disambar 1992 ko babari masjid giraayi gai - Two firs registered in the case - pehali FIR main lakhon agyaat car sevak namjad - In the second FIR, many people including LK Advani were nominated - FIR ke anusaar adwani ke bhadakaau bhaashan kii vajah se masjid giraayi gai - Rai Bareilly court case - baad main donon maamalon ko ikattha sibiai ko saunpa gaya - CBI filed charge sheet on 5 October 1993 - 12 farvari 2001 ko takneekee kaamiyon kii vajah se donon cese alag ho gaye - On 4 May 2001, the sessions court dropped criminal charges against Advani and others - 20 may 2010 ko elahabaad hycourt ne seshan court kaa aadesh barkaraar rakhaa - cbi's reconsideration petition dismissed on 20 May 2010 - nau maheene kii deree ke baad supreme court main CBI kii apil Banaras has become special for all parties in Uttar Pradesh's election mahasamar
 siton ke bantwaare ko lekar aisa manthan ho rahaa he ki maano yahaan kii siten agar jeet leen to uttar pradesh ko jeet lene jaisaa he
 This is because it is the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lihaaja yahaan kii haar or jeet desh ke falak par party kii raajnneeti par gaharaa asar daal sakati he, kyonki ek taraf jahaan banaras kii siton par bijepi ke vijay rath ko rokkar vipakshi yah daawa thokane lagenge ki piem apana hi garh nahin bachaa sake to desh main kya jeetenge
 
 
 At the same time, it will be heavy for the BJP to answer this in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 sutara bataate the ki banaras kii aathon siton par daavedaari kaa nirnay piem kii dekharekh main hoga
 If we look at the Varanasi parliamentary constituency, BJP is occupied by three seats out of the eight assembly seats in the city, northern, city southern and cant seats
 rohaniya or sewapuri vidhansabha seat par samaajawaadee kaa kabja he
 The Congress won the Pindra seat, while the Ajgara and Shivpur seats are with the BSP
 isamen shivpur se bispi ke vidhayak udailaal morya haal hi main bijepi main shaamil ho gaye lihaaja ab bijepi ke paas chaar siten maani ja sakati hai
 The BJP not only wants to capture these four seats, but also wants to win the remaining four seats
 haalanki kai chunaavon se bhaajapa shahar kii teen siton ke alaava kabhi bhi apana paanv nahin failaa pai he
 Despite this, she wants to win all seats on this election
 bhaajapa kii ummiden isliye bhi hai kyonki loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ne sabhi vidhansabha siton par acchhee badhat lee thi
 BJP is trying to save the same votes
 is kaaran pratyaashiyon ke chayan main gambhir manthan ho rahaa he
 The comments sapa-congress ke gathbandhan ke badale sameekaran main yah manthan isliye bhi jaruri ho gaya he kyonki congress pindra kii apni jiti seat ke alaava kaint or dakshini vidhansabha seat par duusare number par thi
 His candidate got 45 thousand votes, so after the alliance with SP, Congress is looking very strong in these seats
 aise main banaras kii seat par bhaajapa kii jeet naak kaa sawaal ban gai he
 The BJP has declared its candidates for five of the eight seats in Varanasi
 usne apni paramparaagat seat shahar dakshini or kaint se apane sitting vidhayakon kaa tikat badal diya he
 In southern, where a worker of the organization was given a ticket, the current mla's son was given the ticket in Cantt
 uttari vidhansabha seat par vartmaan vidhayak ko hi tikat mila
 While one seat went to Bhaspa's account
 baaki kii seat bhi apana dal or bhaasapa gathbandhan ko ja sakati he
 There are more people from his own community here
 kul mila kar kehane kaa matlab yah ki loksabhaa ke chunaav main narendra modi ko jitaane ke liye bhaajapa ne jin ek-ek vot ko sahejkar kaaravaan ko aage badhaayaa tha
 In this campaign, there were some leaders who came from other party
 unamem kai tikat bhi chaahate the
 He did not get a ticket
 lihaaja aise logon ko kaise saheja jaae yah ek badi chunauti he
 Sources said that the decision to claim the eight seats in Benaras will be under the supervision of the PM
 varanasi sansadeey kshetra par agar najar daalen to yahaan kii aath vidhansabha siton main se teen siton shahar uttari, shahar dakshini or kaint seat par bhaajapa kaa kabja he
 The Rohaniya and Sevapuri assembly seats are occupied by Samajwadi
 pindra seat par congress vijayi hui thi to ajgara or shivpur seat basapa ke paas he
 In this, BSP MLA Udayalal Morya from Shivpur recently joined BJP, so now BJP can be considered to have four seats
 bhaajapa in chaaron siton par to apana kabja chaahati hi he saath hi vah baaki bachi chaar siton par bhi apana paracham laharaana chaahati he
 However, due to several elections, the BJP has never been able to spread its footing beyond the three seats in the city
 iske baavjood vah is chunaav par sabhi siton ko jeetna chaahati he
 bjp's hopes are also because in the Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi took a good lead on all the assembly seats
 bijepi unheen voton ko sahejkar rakhane kii firaaq main he
 Due to this there is a serious churn in the selection of candidates
 tippaniyan This churn in the equation has become necessary in lieu of the sp-congress alliance because the Congress was second in the Cantt and Dakshina Vidhan Sabha seats apart from its won seat in Pindra

 Samajwadi Party General Secretary Amar Singh said that our party has never got support from the Congress till date
 amar singh ne kaha ki congress ne samaajawaadee party ko hameshaa apamaanit kiya he
 The Congress never believed in SP
 iske saath hi amar singh ne uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri mayawati par bhi gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 He also demanded the cancellation of the recognition of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)
 amar singh ne bataaya ki iske liye unhone chunaav ayog main ek yachika bhi daayar kii he
 When the stars of the UPA government were in trouble, the Samajwadi Party had crossed its destiny
 lekin samaajawaadee party ko uske badale congress se apmaan or avishvaas ke sivaa kuch nahin mila
 It is alleged that the party's general secretary Amar Singh
 amar singh ne kaha tha ki sanjay dutt ke samaajawaadee party kii tikat par lakhanu se ladane main koi aadchan ai to sanjay kii jagah manyata ko maidan main utaara jayega
 But Diggi Raja, the general secretary of the Congress with whom the seats are being aligned, does not even know who this recognition is
 samajaudi party ne bhale hi sanjay dutt kii patni manyata ke chunavi karier ko manyata de di he
 But mixed reaction is being seen in this matter in political circles
 kabhi samaajawaadee rahe or ab congress kaa haath tham chuke rajbabbar ne manyata ke bare main behad sadhe sur main apni baaten kahin
 However, it is interesting that Rajbabar, who avoided the socialism of the stars, has called the political career of recognition a personal decision of the Samajwadi Party
 kuch isi tarah ke khyal bhaajapa ke bhi hai
 BJP is in the forefront of the politics of stars
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki jab samaajawaadee party ne manyata ko chunaav ladaane kii baat kahi to bijepi ne ise party kaa apana faisla bataaya
 The Samajwadi Party's decision is the most stunned in the Congress
 notakand ke dauraan sarkaar bachaane ke liye congress ne bhale hi samaajawaadee party kaa haath thama lekin jab baat manyata kii siyasat ko manyata dene kii ai to congress mahasachiv ne unhe pahchaanane tak se inkaar kar diya

 viraat kohli ke bachapan ke hiron hai sachin tendulkartendulkar kii tarah behtareen ballebaaj hai viraat kohlisapane main sochataa tha main jita detaa match- kohlibhartiya team ke captain viraat kohli kii tulana cricket ke bhagwaan kahe jane vaale sachin tendulkar se hameshaa kii jaati he
 The reason for this is Kohli's excellent batting
 haalanki viraat kohli ne hameshaa is tulana se duuri banaae rakhi he
 Kohli has said that Sachin is his childhood hero
 viraat kohli ne haal hi main bataaya ki unhone kabhi yah baat maanane se inkaar nahin kiya he ki vah hameshaa se sachin kii tarah bananaa chaahate the
 Kohli said in a web show 'in Depth with Graham Bensinger' that what he used to do was pure skills
 vah jis tarah se ballebaaji karte the wo baaki sabhi se alag thi or isi baat ne mujhe prabhavit kiya
 Had i been, i would have won 
 
 viraat kohli ne kaha, 'main hameshaa kahata tha ki yah kaaphi alag hai or yah itnaa manohar tha ki main apni ankhe nahin hataa paata tha
 i used to go to the shop and after buying chips, etc
, sat in front of the TV just to watch them
 isamen behad majaa aata tha
 Kohli said that i always used to tell people that i want to be like Sachin
 'team india ke captain ne kaha ki mujhe ek cheez yaad he ki jab main match dekhtaa tha or bhartiya team lakshya kaa peechha karte hue haar jaati thi to main sote samay yah sochataa tha ki agar main us sthiti main hota to main match jita le jaataa
 Kohli said that it has happened many times in my career so far

 Explain that Kohli is counted among the best batsmen of the present time
 areemspibadhane se kya hoga? badhati to har saal he, haath main aae to pataa chale, "bihar ke nalanda jile ke kisaan brijmohan kii yah jhunjhalaai tippanee sarkari ghoshnaaon ke jameen par utarane kii hakeekat bayaan karti he
 Brijmohan is a prolific because he had to sell his paddy yield last year at Rs 400 less per quintal than the minimum support price (MSP)
 brijmohan kii tarah hi desh ke aadhe se zyada kisaanon kii upaj ko nunatam samarthan mulya bhi nahin mil paata
 The corrupt policy of government procurement and the lack of warehouses to keep food grains are the biggest obstacles in this path
 ab sarkaar ne kharif fasalon kii emspi, laagat ke e2+effel formule se 1
 We have tried to give a feelgood message to the farmers by increasing it by 5 times
 lekin agle aam chunaavon main iskaa kitna phayda hoga, yah is saal brijmohan jaise kisaanon kii diwali hi bataaegi
 Actually, october-november will be the time when the purchase of Kharif crops will start on the new MSP
 puraani bottle main nai sharabgaanv or kisaanon ke bich faile asantosh ko kam karne ke liye sarkaar ne laagat ke e2+effel formule se 1
 Announced the grant of 5 times MSP (roughly three formulas for estimating agricultural cost and income, see box)
 haalanki kisaan sanghathan sarkaar ke laagat formule se khush najar nahin aa rahe
 Farmer leader V
 em
 Singh says, "government at 1 C2 cost from farmers
 5 guna emspi dene kii baat kahi thi
 The Prime Minister has also mentioned this in his speeches, citing the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee
 lekin sarkaar apane vaade se mukar rahi he
 Offering MSP at A2+ FL cost is nothing new
 yah kaam pichhali sarkaar bhi kar chuki he
 It is like new wine in an old bottle
 ''laagat ke teen formulekrushi laagat or mulya ayog utpaadan laagat tay karne ke teen tareekon ko sweekaar karata he- e2 laagat main kisaan kii ore se kiye gaye sabhi tarah ke bhugtan shaamil hote hai
 The cost of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, laborers' wages, irrigation, fuel etc
 are added to this
 - e2+effel main e2 kii laagat ke saath parivaar ke sadasyon kii ore se kheti main kii gai mehnat kaa mehtaanaa bhi joda jaataa he
 - C2 includes the overall cost as well as estimated rent on the land owned and interest paid on capital
 sabase badi chunautikisaanon kii upaj nunatam samarthan mulya yaa uske upar bike, iskaa daaromadar sarkari kharid par hi tikaa he
 Corruption of government procurement and lack of infrastructure is the biggest obstacle in this path
 krishi laagat or mulya ayog ke purv chairman tajamul haq kehete hai, "desh main 30 fisadi kisaanon ko hi apni fasal kaa nunatam samarthan mulya mil paata he
 Government procurement policy needs to be changed
 rajyon kii aarthik sehat badi sarkari kharid ke liye durust nahin he
 "haq believes that the government should not only distribute rice and wheat in every state through the Public Distribution System (PDS)
" isamen transportesan kii laagat bhi lagati he or peedies main baanta gaya anaaj vahaan kii janata kii jaruraton ke anukool nahin hota
 It would be better if the government also purchases other crops and distributes food grains as per the requirement through PDS in every state
 udhaaharan ke taur par, dakshin ke rajyon main gehun se behatar hoga ki sarkaar raagi kaa vitaran kare
 The way to cultivate farmers by increasing MSP is not new
 isse pehle kii sarkarein bhi chunavi varshon main is tareeke ko apana chuki hai
 The Modi government does not want to miss this bet on farmers
 yahi kaaran he ki kharid niti ko durust karne ke liye bhi kaam jari he
 The government can take any initiative on the lines of Bhavantar Yojana of Madhya Pradesh, under which registered traders all over the country will buy the farmers' produce on behalf of the government
 iske baad bazaar ke bhav or emspi ke antar kii bharpai sarkaar kii ore se kii jaaegi
 Apart from this, the challenge will be to evacuate the filled warehouses of Food Corporation of India (FCI) before the next crop comes to the market
 june 2018 tak epasiai kii kul kshamta ke 93 fisadi godaam bhare hai
 Right now the government, through the agencies of the states, does government procurement only in those states where the production is more than the state needs
 emspi kaa dabl trapkisaanon ko raahat dene ke liye emspi main badhotaree darasal sarkaar ko dohari duvidha main daal detii he
 The benefit of increase in MSP should not reach the farmers but inflation in the market definitely increases
 kharif fasalon kii emspi main badhotaree kaa sidhaa matlab he chaaval, daal, kapaas or soyabean jaisi camodity ke daam kaa bad janaa
 The prices of such products also increase, whose raw material is the same commodity
 rashtriya lok vitt evam niti santhaan kii salaahkaar or arthshaastri radhika pandey kahati hai, "emspi main badhotaree se kisaanon ko kuch raahat jarur milegi lekin iskaa asar mahangaai par bhi dekhne ko milegaa
 Due to the increased MSP, retail inflation could see an increase of 40 to 50 basis points
 '' haal kii maudrik policy samiksha main bhartiya rigerv bank bhi emspi main vruddhi se mahangaai badaae kii ashanka jataa chukaa he
 This fear of rising inflation will close the doors of cheap loans more firmly
 mahangaai kaa baduya or saste karj kii ummid ko jhatka yani madhyam varg par dohari maar
 Surely it is equally important for the government to keep this section happy
 ulajhanein or bhiemaspi main badhotaree kaa asar keval mahangaai tak hi simit nahin he balki sarkari khajaane par bhi iskaa boj padegaa
 The promise of giving 50 percent more MSP than the cost would put an additional burden of Rs 33,500 crore on the government exchequer
 radhika pandey kahati hai, "sarkari kharid kaa atirikt boj rajkoshiya ghate par 0
 Can affect up to 1 percent
 haalanki jiesti sangrah main sudhaar rajkoshiya ghate par iske asar ko kam kar saktaa he
 "the road to victory in the upcoming elections will pass through the village itself
" aise main kharif fasalon kii badi emspi kaa puraa phayda kisaanon ko mili sarkaar iskaa bharsak prayaas karegi
 The hope of the government is that the result of hard work will be seen in the light of diyas burning in the village on Diwali and the anger of the farmers will reduce
 lekin bahut kuch is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki sarkaar emspi ko kisaanon tak pahunchaa paati he yaa nahin
 What is the new MSP? Agriculture sector is very important for providing food security and employment in rural areas to every citizen of the country
 lekin durbhagyavash aazaadee ke baad se ab tak ham upabhoktaaon ke kalyaan ke naam par prakritik sansadhano or kisaanon kaa shoshan kar rahe hai
 It is sad that the elected government of a socialist and democratic welfare state is not willing to consider reasonable cost (C2) as the basis in fixing the minimum support price (MSP) for farmers
 sarkaar ke daawey ke mutabik kisaanon ko unki upaj par 50 fisadi se zyada kaa ritern mil rahaa he
 But according to the actual cost, the farmers will get 10 to 20 percent profit
 kya yah kisaan pariwaron ke bharan poshan ke liye kaaphi he? saaf he ki sarkaar kii ore se tay emspi se kisaanon ke jivan str main koi badlaav nahin aane vaala
 The poverty and crisis of rural areas cannot be overcome with these msps
 mere hisaab se ab samay aa chukaa he ki emspi ko khatm karke kisi nae idia ke saath kisaanon kii kshatipurti ko sunishchit kiya jaae
 In a free market economy and global market, MSP is not an effective method
 jab duniya bhar ke camodity bazaar neeche ja rahe hai, ham emspi badha rahe hai
 This will end the competitiveness of the Indian economy and agro-based industries
 nai emspi kii tulana main antarrashtriya bazaar main krishi utpaadon ke daam kaaphi kam hai
 For example, maize has a new MSP of Rs 1,700
 prati quintal he, jabaki antarrashtriya bazaar main bhav 1,227 ru
 Per quintal
 isi tarah sanflower seed kii nai emspi 5,388 ru
 Per quintal while the price in the international market is Rs 2,900
 prati quintal he
 In such a situation, Indian agricultural products will not be able to compete in the field of exports
 iskaa asar gharelu bazaar par bhi padegaa
 The government compensates the difference between the MSP and the market price through schemes like Bhavantar to help farmers in case the commodity price goes down
 emspi kaa laabh kisaanon tak pahunchane ke liye un sabhi kanoonon kii samiksha kii jarurat he jo kisaanon kii upaj ko bazaar tak laane kii laagat ko badhaate hai
 All laws are more than 10 years old
 centre sarkaar ko krishi kshetra main riform ke liye jiesti kii tarah phir raajnneetik ichhashakti dikhaani hogi
 Reform in agriculture will be the biggest test of cooperative operativeism
 kya siyaasi netritv kisaanon kii madad ke liye is baadha ko paar karne kaa saahas dikhaa saktaa he? yadi nahin to nai emspi mahaj kaagaj kaa ek tukdaa rah jaaegi, jisase kisaanon ko koi aarthik laabh nahin hoga

 maharashtra main chunavi bigul baj chukaa he to netaaon kaa dal bhi jor-shor se prachaar main jute gaya he
 Like every time, this time also small helicopter and chopper is the first choice of leaders in the campaign

 The leaders of the Congress, BJP and NCP are among the most sought after choppers and helicopters
 duusari ore, chunaav prachaar ke dauraan vimaan haadase main kai netaa apni jaan gavaan chuke hai
 Despite this, the chopper love of its leaders is not leaving them
 raajnneetik vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki choper se chunaav prachaar karnaa jahaan suvidhajanak he, vahiin yah fishan ke saath hi states simbel bhi ban gaya he

 aipal ne is maamle par maafee maangate hue kaha he ki wo iphone 6 or usase aage ke modells ke bydaree riplosment ke kharche ko 79 dollar se kam karke 29 dollar kar degaa
 Generally, customers in India also have to spend more money to replace the old iphone battery
 ek bayaan main aipal ne kaha he, ‘company ne kisi bhi aipal product kelife ko kam karne ke liye jaanboojhkar kuch nahin kiya he or naa aage wo aisa karegi
 Apple has emphasized that the company introduced features in this year's ios upgrade to slow down battery performance and protect the iphone from unwanted shutdowns
 isse bydaree life badhaai ja sakati he
 Apple has said in one of its statements, 'we know that some of you feel that Apple has broken your trust
 ham iske liye maafee maangate hai’aipal ne kaha he ki puraane iphone main nai bydaree lagane se kisi tarah ke slo hone se jude apadet kii samasya se bachaa ja saktaa he

 On November 3, Justice SN Dhingra ruled that Shekhar's plea was not admissible

 kolkata nite rides (keker) ke sah-maalik khan ne kaha, ‘meraa vaaki maananaa he ki unhen (pakistani khilaadiyon) ko chunaa janaa chahie tha
 However, he said that the case involved 'some issues' which the IPL could 'respectfully' handle
 khan ne kaha ki pakistani khilaadi duniya ke ‘best tii-20 khilaadi’ hai
 Khan said that 'he is a winner and amazing but there are some issues apart from this and we cannot deny it
 ’shahrukh khan ne kaha ki keker ke maalik hone ke naate unke liye yah sharmnaak tha ki nilaamee main naam shaamil kiye jane ke baavjood kisi ne bhi pakistani khilaadiyon ke liye boli nahin lagaai
 He said, 'we are known to invite everyone

 Even if there was an issue, they had to consider it in advance
 khan ne kaha, ‘har din ham pakistan ko koste hai
 Pakistan curses us every day
 yah ek mudda he
 'it is noteworthy that Khan had five players in KKR in the first edition of IPL

 Former Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, while taking a sarcasm at Narendra Modi and Amitabh Bachchan, even went as far as to say 'uda ki dekho buffalo saathon, spend a few days in Gujarat'
 nitish kumaar se jab baton-baton main poocha gaya ki isamen pradhanmantri kaa kya dosha aap naagarik uddyan mantri ko nishane par kyon nahin lete? to unhone google kholkar jawaab diya ki ‘pusapati ashok gajpati raju’ kaa ek baar naam lene ke liye do baar to google par jhaankna padataa he, un par tohamat lagaaein to kaise aarope puraa hone se pehle naam bhul jaataa he
 But whose buffalo is this? Nitish Kumar, whoever hears sarcasm, but right now he does not even have the answer to the big question which is bigger than the buffalo

 Separated the mother from sons and took one of them with her? Is it a villain or a babysitter? Destruction is certain when the villain begins to seek the support of old age in the enemy's child

 The only punishment for a traitor is death: when the villain fails to do nothing to the hero, he goes away
 aise maukey par khambha nochane kii bajaay apane hi logon ko maar apni takat kam kar letaa he
 If a poor person has given a little information here and there, he gets only one sentence of traitor
 
 Death shot like a heavy-handed dialogue

 phir naa kah dene ke baad villen kii kya bisaat?takiya kalam le dubegaa:villen sabase zyada mehnat apane takiya kalam dohraane main kar daalata he
 Many times, the villain kills Villain also because by the end he is caught after listening to his pillow pen
 chhod de meri maa ko:sabakuch kar jab villen haar chukaa hota he to hero ko bulaane ke liye uski maa-bahan ko kaid kar letaa he
 This is his biggest mistake
 ham hindustani gharavaalon ke maamle main bade centi hote hai or is harakat ke baad villen kaa maranaa yaa sudharna nishchit hota he
 Stop this dance song: Hero Villain came to the base and his henchmen imprisoned him
 phir jane villen ko kya suujhi,lite-sound ke saath dance kaa kaarykram bhi rakhwa liya
 If you want to kill the next one, then why are you doing entertainment by showing these matinee shows? Between this three-four minute song, the junior artists get a chance to show the caricature by eating the footage and the hero is out of captivity

 Villain beat the hero fiercely

 Do not keep all the coins in the same pocket: Villain whole life is intelligent
 sharif bana hota he
 It does not leave a clue behind, but at the last moment when the hero confronts all the movable and immovable property in one place, it becomes very easy to kill a match in the end and set his entire empire on fire or red-handed
